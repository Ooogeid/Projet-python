1
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:05,823
I booked a sketch artist,
an improve troupe,

2
00:00:05,948 --> 00:00:08,582
there'll be a laser projecting
a burning pelvis onto the ceiling.

3
00:00:08,707 --> 00:00:09,717
A laser!

4
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:12,883
This isn't gonna be your mom sexually
transmitted disease awareness fair.

5
00:00:13,887 --> 00:00:15,757
You've been quite the little helper.

6
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:17,975
STD fair, guys.
Catch knowledge.

7
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:28,736
You think you're better?

8
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:31,260
You stick to quotin' movie lines.

9
00:00:31,385 --> 00:00:33,950
- I'll stick to sports.
- I'm trying to reduce my pop-cultural.

10
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:35,821
You're not moving into sports.

11
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:39,555
You and I are playing
real basketball, right now.

12
00:00:40,588 --> 00:00:42,123
- Sounds fun.
- No, it doesn't!

13
00:00:43,058 --> 00:00:44,293
And it won't be.

14
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,754
- Catch knowledge.
- Sorry, not interested...

15
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:49,523
In ignoring your
very important cause.

16
00:00:49,779 --> 00:00:51,008
Hi, I'm Jeff Winger.

17
00:00:51,588 --> 00:00:53,597
Sabrina is my new secretary.

18
00:00:53,722 --> 00:00:56,215
"Secretary" is a little
degrading to women.

19
00:00:56,494 --> 00:00:59,325
- I help the dean do <i>officey</i> things.
- Gender saved.

20
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,232
My casual friend and I are gonna have
a non-romantic breakfast

21
00:01:03,357 --> 00:01:06,178
- if you'd like to join us.
- The cafeteria's closed .

22
00:01:06,303 --> 00:01:07,981
- Fortune cookie?
- Isn't it great?

23
00:01:08,106 --> 00:01:10,365
Greendale is the latest campus
to catch a case

24
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,904
of public health fever!

25
00:01:12,191 --> 00:01:15,228
You know the toilets in
the women's bathrooms don't have seats?

26
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:19,113
Because they keep getting stolen.
Sabrina, take a note.

27
00:01:19,238 --> 00:01:21,622
I want hidden cameras
in every stall.

28
00:01:22,353 --> 00:01:23,776
Problem solved.

29
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,399
- "You will get aids."
- Flip it over.

30
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:31,507
- "Unless you go to the STD fair."
- I wrote that.

31
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:34,260
Congratu...
Horrible!

32
00:01:35,782 --> 00:01:38,252
See you later.
Catch knowledge.

33
00:01:46,956 --> 00:01:47,940
We are friends?

34
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,586
You may have noticed
a recent change in my...

35
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,988
- demeanor.
- No.

36
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:55,740
Well, I have a new girlfriend.

37
00:01:56,126 --> 00:01:59,744
And she is super smart,
if you know what I mean.

38
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:02,788
- I always know what you mean.
- Can't wait for you to meet her.

39
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:04,847
When you catch a big fish,

40
00:02:04,972 --> 00:02:07,331
you want to stuff her
and put her on the mantle.

41
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,880
- How'bout tonight?
- I doubt it.

42
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:13,864
- We played basketball. It was fun.
- Don't gloat.

43
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:15,511
It's impossible to guard you.

44
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,874
Your eyes are too gentle
and mysterious.

45
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,475
Jeff and I are double-dating tonight
with my new girlfriend.

46
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:27,772
- You got that from "I doubt it"?
- Pierce has got a girlfriend!

47
00:02:28,563 --> 00:02:31,108
- That's great. What does she do?
- She's an escort.

48
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,737
Some mysteries solve themselves, no?

49
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:37,628
That's just her profession.
She doesn't escort me.

50
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:40,618
I met her in my marketing class.

51
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:43,704
And I'm taking doreen
to annie's mixer tonight.

52
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,248
You mean the STD fair.
Catch knowledge.

53
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,544
Taking a call girl to an STD fair.

54
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:50,528
There's a joke here.

55
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:53,214
Dust off that black book
and rustle up a honey.

56
00:02:53,618 --> 00:02:56,842
Is there a pill that
makes the word "no" clearer?

57
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,678
it is pretty short notice.
Probably couldn't get a date anyway.

58
00:03:02,073 --> 00:03:03,349
I'm sure you're right.

59
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:08,608
Maybe it has something to do with crabs.
They're like a food, but also a disease.

60
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:11,102
You know, I wonder,
for all your feather flashing,

61
00:03:11,227 --> 00:03:13,150
when was the last time
you actually scored?

62
00:03:13,438 --> 00:03:14,945
I don't know the precise date,

63
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,324
'cause I'm not you,
so there's no receipt.

64
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:21,408
Come on.

65
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,912
You shouldn't take potshots at some
poor woman 'cause you can't get a date.

66
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,346
I can get dates anytime I want.

67
00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:31,111
- What is this, some kind of joke?
- No. This is.

68
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:33,211
"Don't eat the crab dip."

69
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:40,021
You hear that, Annie?
That's the sound of STD's screaming,

70
00:03:40,146 --> 00:03:42,471
"no! Stop being so aware of us!"

71
00:03:44,443 --> 00:03:45,850
And it's all thanks to you.

72
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,978
I was voted most likely
to succeed at my rehab clinic.

73
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:51,792
Well, in recognition
of all your hard work,

74
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:54,730
I have decided that you
should conduct

75
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:56,456
the condom demonstration.

76
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:59,446
You're gonna be center stage
showing everyone

77
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,184
how to put a condom on a,

78
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,742
what my dad called a Jimmy Carter.

79
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,776
- Am I the right person for that?
- Don't worry, not a real one.

80
00:04:08,901 --> 00:04:11,594
No, it's an anatomically
correct model, you know.

81
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,277
But trust me, eyes closed,
you can't tell the difference.

82
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,557
It's Jeff Winger.

83
00:04:28,627 --> 00:04:30,794
I wanted to see
what you were doing tonight.

84
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,959
Do I know your name?

85
00:04:34,084 --> 00:04:36,421
What kind of a question is that?
Of course I know.

86
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:39,069
Well, if I answer now,

87
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,398
you'll never learn
a valuable lesson about trust,

88
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,452
Pierce really got to you, huh?

89
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:50,862
It has been a dry spell.

90
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:53,286
That's only 'cause it's
been a while since I've tried.

91
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:55,640
- I'm trying.
- I can see that.

92
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:58,005
This is a lot of outgoing calls.

93
00:04:58,442 --> 00:05:01,925
"Car wash redhead.
Tube top, REM Concert.

94
00:05:02,445 --> 00:05:04,678
Juror number six."
That sounds aboveboard.

95
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:07,431
- At least you have "mommy" in here.
- It's not my mom.

96
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,426
Dude, not cool.

97
00:05:09,984 --> 00:05:12,105
You saying "dude" is not cool.

98
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:14,733
What are you doing?

99
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:17,983
"Hot blonde, spanish class"?

100
00:05:18,438 --> 00:05:21,382
- You're welcome.
- This is the phone book 20s' man.

101
00:05:21,507 --> 00:05:23,810
The women literally have
no identities.

102
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,407
It's pretty shallow.

103
00:05:26,131 --> 00:05:27,177
You're right.

104
00:05:27,998 --> 00:05:29,912
I can't believe I haven't
seen it before.

105
00:05:30,552 --> 00:05:32,826
Whatever.
I'm gonna go study with Shirley.

106
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,751
I'll be here...
Rethinking my way of life.

107
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:42,558
<i>Call mommy.</i>

108
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:45,469
Guys...
I have a problem.

109
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:50,118
The dean wants me to demonstrate
the proper use of a condom

110
00:05:50,243 --> 00:05:52,787
at the stupid fair by putting one
on a mannequin's stupid...

111
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:54,293
<i>Thingamabob.</i>

112
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:56,994
It's a big honor...

113
00:05:58,073 --> 00:06:01,244
- But I'm gonna screw it up.
- Well, it's easy enough to practice.

114
00:06:01,369 --> 00:06:02,695
Do you've a banana?

115
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:06,320
This is an anatomically
correct model I'll be handling.

116
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:07,433
Real...

117
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,029
Whatchamacallits...
Are nothing like bananas!

118
00:06:10,957 --> 00:06:11,704
No?

119
00:06:13,262 --> 00:06:16,250
- Have you never seen one?
- Annie...

120
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,294
Being a virgin in this day and age
is something to be proud of.

121
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:22,545
- You're like a unicorn.
- I am not a unicorn.

122
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:26,760
I had relations
with my high school boyfriend.

123
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:30,299
We did it to <i>Madonna's erotica</i>
on the floor of his walk-in closet.

124
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:32,287
But he wouldn't let me look at it.

125
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,891
And he cried after.
And during.

126
00:06:37,282 --> 00:06:39,815
- He's gay now.
- I think he was gay then.

127
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,639
So you, uh, you never seen one
when you were growing up?

128
00:06:42,764 --> 00:06:45,779
Like, you know, on the internet,
in a picture, or Harvey Keitel's?

129
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,319
I've caught glimpses, I've never got
a real good look at one.

130
00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:51,807
What I need to do

131
00:06:51,932 --> 00:06:55,289
is practice on the actual model,
but the dean has put it in his office.

132
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,791
That's easy enough.
We'll go to him and ask him...

133
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:02,126
This is really embarrassing.
I don't want anyone to know.

134
00:07:02,251 --> 00:07:05,084
I just want to figure out how to do it
and get it over with.

135
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,144
The dean is counting on me,

136
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:09,595
and I want him to know that
I'm someone he can trust.

137
00:07:11,657 --> 00:07:13,319
We've to break into his office.

138
00:07:15,012 --> 00:07:17,724
- I actually have no problem with that.
- I think I could do that.

139
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,198
I was just going into the fair
to wait for my smokin'- hot date.

140
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,054
- That's nice.
- How'bout you?

141
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:32,927
Were you ever able to, you know,

142
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,828
come up with a, you know, date?

143
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:37,288
No, because I didn't try.

144
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:40,209
Because taking a date
to an STD fair would be lame.

145
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,719
Don't worry about it, kid.

146
00:07:41,844 --> 00:07:44,379
What you're going through
is a dry spell. From my experience,

147
00:07:44,504 --> 00:07:47,205
they don't last any more
than 12, 13 years.

148
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,442
Excuse me.

149
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,610
WHEEL OF REMORSE

150
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:55,995
No, syphilis.

151
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,942
Please, no, syphilis.

152
00:07:59,258 --> 00:08:00,472
It burns!

153
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:03,440
Gross. Dean, your assistant.

154
00:08:03,627 --> 00:08:05,712
Is she single?
What are her likes and dislikes?

155
00:08:05,837 --> 00:08:08,868
Yes on single.
She likes hip-hop and horses.

156
00:08:08,993 --> 00:08:10,948
Dislikes beards and...
I was done talking.

157
00:08:14,877 --> 00:08:18,812
Is it me, or are horses
the most beautiful creatures?

158
00:08:19,176 --> 00:08:21,695
- They're so majestic.
- Totally.

159
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,931
Just this morning when I was shaving
and listening to the new Jay-z,

160
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:28,006
I was thinking about how
I want to squeeze in a quick gallop .

161
00:08:28,362 --> 00:08:29,779
Do you own a horse?

162
00:08:30,868 --> 00:08:33,262
Can you ever really own a horse?

163
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,571
This is sabrina.

164
00:08:39,696 --> 00:08:41,497
About 30 seconds after
you walked away,

165
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:44,022
I asked her to be my date for the fair,
and she said yes.

166
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:46,941
- You must have a great personality.
- Thank you.

167
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:48,814
Congratulations,
You proved me wrong.

168
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:50,779
- You got a girl.
- Yeah, I did.

169
00:08:51,671 --> 00:08:53,699
This is Doreen.
Ready for our double date?

170
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,206
Yes, I am.
Wait, how'd you do that?

171
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:02,560
Is this the best
safe sex fair or what?

172
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,752
Check out these condoms.

173
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,535
All along the side
it says "Greendale"!

174
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,923
Exclamation point, my idea.

175
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:15,755
Me in a dune buggy.
With syphilis.

176
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,446
This is going on the fridge.

177
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:21,101
Look how gorgeous Doreen is tonight.

178
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,108
Can we...

179
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:26,667
Let's lay out our plans
for the evening.

180
00:09:27,002 --> 00:09:29,182
You wing man me,
I wing man you.

181
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:31,703
Maybe we split up
for a little hoo-ha.

182
00:09:32,469 --> 00:09:35,657
And then meet in the morning
for eggs and...

183
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,990
Details.

184
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:39,859
That sounds like the worst
combination plate ever.

185
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:46,020
I can't believe you beat me again!

186
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:48,413
You want my stuffed animal?

187
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:52,145
We're arm wrestling.

188
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,382
Like Stallone in <i>over the top.</i>
I'm not sure of all the rules.

189
00:09:56,507 --> 00:10:00,390
- We need a semi truck and a son?
- The rules are you suck! Let's go!

190
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:05,051
I wanna wait for a more inspiring song.
This score isn't right.

191
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,697
There we go.

192
00:10:39,818 --> 00:10:41,474
You broke my hand, you bastard.

193
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,951
- I can't do anything with this.
- Let me see that.

194
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:04,711
I can see through the door.

195
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:08,459
Thar she blows.

196
00:11:08,943 --> 00:11:10,197
I wanna see!

197
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,258
I need to see.

198
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:19,753
It's okay.

199
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,395
I had it wrong!

200
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:34,497
- Is that considered large?
- Yes.

201
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:40,116
What in the reverse porky's
is going on here?

202
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:44,976
You know,
Doreen speaks six languages.

203
00:11:45,258 --> 00:11:47,707
You should hear her
order wine in French.

204
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,723
Honey,
say caber-net sauv-a-gong-da-nun.

205
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:53,888
- Pierce, you're embarrassing me.
- You know a lot about wine?

206
00:11:54,055 --> 00:11:57,216
 I did have a client
who owned a vineyard in Napa.

207
00:11:57,615 --> 00:12:01,387
He was into S&M and Merlot,
so we called it S&M&M.

208
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:05,599
Honey, you're boring the crap
out of Jeff.

209
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,931
Be right back.
I have to make tinkles.

210
00:12:10,437 --> 00:12:12,646
Then, I'm gonna go
get us another round.

211
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,634
You are not what I expected.
You're smart, you're classy.

212
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:21,324
- You're not wearing go-go boots.
- They're in the shop.

213
00:12:22,298 --> 00:12:23,938
Despite what most people think,

214
00:12:24,105 --> 00:12:26,504
I actually spend
most of my time talking.

215
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:29,797
As men get older,
they wanna spend their time

216
00:12:29,964 --> 00:12:32,084
with someone they can have
a real conversation with.

217
00:12:32,404 --> 00:12:33,753
That is going to suck.

218
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,410
"Going to", Jeff?

219
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:37,256
Sabrina's cute,

220
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:41,510
but she thinks that Monty Python
is the evil snake from Harry Potter.

221
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:45,556
I know girls I can converse with
who are way more annoying.

222
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,018
I will take "tinkles"
over "we need to talk" every time.

223
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,789
- Ready to show me that Lexus?
- I thought you'd never ask.

224
00:12:59,274 --> 00:13:00,738
It was very nice to meet you.

225
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:02,615
You can do better.

226
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,041
Here.

227
00:13:11,469 --> 00:13:14,085
They already left?
What a couple of nincompoops!

228
00:13:14,978 --> 00:13:17,457
Before I buy dinner,
I have to ask...

229
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,269
Is there any lovemaking
on the table?

230
00:13:21,293 --> 00:13:22,493
We're through.

231
00:13:23,264 --> 00:13:26,285
I'm gonna go to the bar,
and you can join me if you'd like.

232
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:28,892
And we can still have
a lovely evening.

233
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,935
But it will cost you 200 bucks.

234
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,462
That is a pretty big discount.

235
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,249
I had no idea alcohol
would make people horny.

236
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:00,901
Makes me sleepy.

237
00:14:02,664 --> 00:14:05,334
We have a 597 currently
going on in your office.

238
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:06,505
A 597?

239
00:14:06,922 --> 00:14:09,653
There's a dog-fighting ring
in my office?

240
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,770
I'm just gonna turn him around,
and we're gonna cover him up.

241
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:17,290
Ladies, I am shocked

242
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,775
at the reverse porky's
that has happened here tonight.

243
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,612
I don't see what the big deal is.
Annie needed to look at the pe...

244
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:27,078
The "p" word has entered into play.

245
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:30,661
That's exactly why I wanted Gail,
our school counselor,

246
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,830
and Monique, who's keeping record,

247
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:36,459
to ensure we discuss these topics
in a legally appropriate manner.

248
00:14:36,849 --> 00:14:38,792
Everyone should say penis

249
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,556
so we can take away
the negative power of the word.

250
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:43,266
So, everybody...

251
00:14:43,904 --> 00:14:45,760
- Penis.
- She didn't say it.

252
00:14:46,243 --> 00:14:49,197
Now, why did you break in
to see the penis?

253
00:14:50,131 --> 00:14:52,628
I really do feel more comfortable
saying that now, Gail.

254
00:14:52,795 --> 00:14:55,124
I just want to focus on the girl

255
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:57,396
who won't say penis.

256
00:15:06,654 --> 00:15:10,034
This is a judgment-free zone,
so express yourself.

257
00:15:14,534 --> 00:15:15,646
You know what...

258
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:19,502
I don't want to express myself.

259
00:15:20,614 --> 00:15:23,172
I don't want to sit in
a room full of people

260
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:27,218
and say the "p" word.
I like being repressed.

261
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,108
I am totally comfortable
being uncomfortable

262
00:15:30,275 --> 00:15:31,639
with my sexuality.

263
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,101
And maybe, just maybe,

264
00:15:34,508 --> 00:15:36,707
if everyone were
a little bit more like me,

265
00:15:36,874 --> 00:15:39,605
we wouldn't have
to have an STD fair.

266
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,941
- You go, girl!
- That's my pumpkin!

267
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,987
By the way,
now that I've gotten a good look at one,

268
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,077
I don't see
what all the fuss was about.

269
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,693
A giant thumb in a turtleneck.

270
00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:04,649
You a really awesome body.

271
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,838
- You probably hear that all the time.
- Not as much as I should.

272
00:16:10,717 --> 00:16:11,595
Professor...

273
00:16:13,734 --> 00:16:14,734
What?

274
00:16:15,386 --> 00:16:16,475
I'm not a professor.

275
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:19,937
But you're at Greendale...
And you're old.

276
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:21,814
I'm a student.

277
00:16:22,604 --> 00:16:23,440
Yikers.

278
00:16:23,837 --> 00:16:25,651
Pretty much yikers for me too.

279
00:16:28,264 --> 00:16:31,650
I guess I can make an exception...
Professor.

280
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,254
You know...

281
00:16:41,947 --> 00:16:43,628
- I can't do this.
- What?

282
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,100
- This is your car.
- Keep it.

283
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,745
How you like those apples?

284
00:16:58,912 --> 00:17:00,299
I don't like those apples.

285
00:17:01,032 --> 00:17:02,107
I'm so upset.

286
00:17:02,663 --> 00:17:04,782
It was just a fluke
I won those other games.

287
00:17:09,353 --> 00:17:12,781
This may be the only STD fair
to actually spread STDs.

288
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:14,201
Shut up, Ben!

289
00:17:14,777 --> 00:17:16,744
Condom water balloon fight!

290
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:23,671
What the hell?

291
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,377
These are leaking.

292
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,210
That's why you don't print things
on condoms.

293
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,344
Everyone's getting preggers,
and it's all your fault.

294
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,347
I love it!

295
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:45,031
All the condoms are faulty.

296
00:17:45,451 --> 00:17:48,859
As the best athlete on campus,
I need you to run to my office

297
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,153
and make an announcement
before everyone leaves.

298
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:56,200
I am not the best athlete on campus.

299
00:17:58,196 --> 00:17:59,222
Abed is.

300
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:03,082
- I know you let me win the race.
- But you didn't say anything.

301
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,507
That's because...

302
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:07,002
I wanted it to be true.

303
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:09,927
- You're a really good friend.
- No, Abed...

304
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:14,843
- You are.
- Run!

305
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,761
Go, Abed, go,
before people sex one another!

306
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:26,981
There he is.

307
00:18:27,644 --> 00:18:29,483
Back already.
Detail time?

308
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:30,857
I stopped.

309
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:34,033
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I mean, she's hot.

310
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:36,949
I think this place is
sapping my life force.

311
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,223
It's not Greendale, Jeff, it's you.

312
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:41,203
You're becoming more mature.

313
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,285
A man reaches a point in his life

314
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:46,802
where he stops looking for a place
to hang his underwear

315
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:49,378
and starts looking for a place
to hang his hat.

316
00:18:51,377 --> 00:18:54,640
I'm sorry, I was waiting for that
to become inappropriate or racist.

317
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,759
What happened to Doreen?

318
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,640
She said if I wanted to continue
the night I'd have to pay.

319
00:19:03,527 --> 00:19:04,518
That is rough.

320
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,333
No, it was a wake-up call.

321
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,856
Doreen's a very special lady.
I did not treat her right.

322
00:19:09,671 --> 00:19:11,066
I have stuff to work on.

323
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:13,235
You'll get there.

324
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:16,580
We're both gonna get there.

325
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:20,534
Here's to being better men.

326
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:23,471
Cheers.

327
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,091
So could I borrow 200 bucks?

328
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,045
Tell Doreen I say hi.

329
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,689
You know, for 220 I can get the...

330
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:38,969
I'll give you 250
if you don't finish telling me.

331
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:40,810
I can get it twice.

332
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,796
College. Best years of our lives.

333
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:15,398
<i>Attention, greendale students.</i>

334
00:20:15,941 --> 00:20:17,635
<i>Don't use the condoms!</i>

335
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:19,921
<i>If you're going to have sex tonight,</i>

336
00:20:20,188 --> 00:20:22,055
<i>don't use condoms.</i>

337
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:31,198
The characteristic of an asset
to donate or accept a proton

338
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:33,701
cannot be quantified
for individual species.

339
00:20:34,043 --> 00:20:36,181
Comparing
two donor/acceptor systems,

340
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:40,644
the proton transposition HA+H2O...

341
00:21:00,106 --> 00:21:01,677
You would give a glass of water?
