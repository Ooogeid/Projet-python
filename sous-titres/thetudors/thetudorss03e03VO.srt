The Tudors Season 3 Episode 3

2
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,900
How in God's name, we suppose to bannish by adultery

3
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,980
and superstition and empty ritual from our churches

4
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,090
when they are still practice here at court.

5
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,790
When shall I meet the Majesty, my lord?

6
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,950
very soon. Majesty is most eager to talk to you.

7
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,240
In the meantime, he encouraged you to write a lengthy declaration of

8
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,710
everything you did during the rebellion and the reasons for it.

9
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,620
Keep still.

10
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,040
who are you? what are you doing here.

11
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,260
You can't be here.

12
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,310
Oh my God, it's true. I didn't believe it.

13
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,910
get out. get out.

14
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,180
no. she is my fiancee.

15
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,190
- well, should I...?	-No, I don't...

16
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,410
There's no cause being here.

17
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,300
I warned you.

18
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,720
Is he alive?

19
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,530
Master Holbein.

20
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,950
- Master Holbein. - Your Majesty.

21
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,230
I must beg Your Majesty's pardon.

22
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,300
Pardon? What for?

23
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,650
I have committed an assault within the verge of your court.

24
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:12,490
An assault? you? But you're an artist.

25
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,420
I was painting the picture of Lady Misseldon that Your Majesty commisioned,

26
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,510
but a gentleman interrupted us.

27
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,590
What did you do?

28
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:25,800
I threw the gentleman into some shelves.

29
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,870
You did the right thing, Master Holbein.

30
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,610
And I'll forgive you freely, I might have done the same thing myself.

31
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,650
Just finish the portrait. I can't wait.

32
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

33
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,940
Master Holbein.

34
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,400
Sir Robert Tavistock.

35
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,860
-Sir Robert, you look have assaults. -Your Majesty

36
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,950
I have a great complaints to make against Master Holbein.

37
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,740
I am engaged to a young woman.

38
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,900
but found him painting her. Naked.

39
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,490
Naked?

40
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,180
Yes, Your Majesty. on a bed, like some concubine.

41
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,470
I demanded that, Your Majesty, punish Mr. Holbein severely,for his lewdness,

42
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,590
his immorality, and his violence against me.

43
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,550
You have not to do with Mr Holbein, but with me.

44
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,010
I tell you frankly.

45
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,070
If I have seven peasants, I can make seven lords.

46
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,020
but if I have seven lords, I couldn't make one Holbein.

47
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:47,020
Then tell me truthfully, do you still wish me to punish Mr. Holbein?

48
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,030
No, Your Majesty. I ask for Your Majesty's pardon.

49
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,720
I am Your Majesty's humble and obedient servant,

50
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,830
and make no complaints against Mr. Holbein.

51
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,210
Good lad.

52
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,140
Happy Christmas, Robert.

53
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,000
- Majesty? - Sweetheart.

54
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,250
May I present someone to you?

55
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,310
Very well.

56
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,080
The Countess of Salisbury was my old governess

57
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,990
I know. I know the Lady very well.

58
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,290
- Lady Margaret?	- Your Majesty.

59
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,120
You are very welcome here to court.

60
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,370
I know how rearly you quit your fine house.

61
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,400
It is true.

62
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,600
I prefer to live a life based on piety and traditional ways, Your Majesty.

63
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,430
You're an example to everyone here at court.

64
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,840
How was your son, Reginald Pole?

65
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,270
Is he still studying in Italy?

66
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,090
Yes, indeed, Your Majesty.

67
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,260
He is now at Padua Univeristy,

68
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,310
and has more reasons than most to be grateful to Your Majesty.

69
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:04,470
Since until very recently, you continue to pay his fees.

70
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,260
I showed great interest in him.

71
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,870
He showed great promise as scholar, as well as being my cousin,

72
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,480
Still, when you refused my offer to make him the youngest

73
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,090
ever Bishop of Winchester.

74
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,270
I remeber I had to thump him.

75
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,930
Your Majesty must believe it was not in gratitude on Reginald's part. No, no.

76
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,700
He was in tears after leaving Your Majesty's presence.

77
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,090
The truth is my son is too much of a scholar

78
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,980
and private person ever to desire public office or notoriety.

79
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,820
Then after all, I forgive him.

80
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,160
- Majesty.  - Lady Salisbury.

81
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,380
You ladies are conspiring something.

82
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,480
we were both like to present someone else to Your Majesty at this Christmastide.

83
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,290
Very well.

84
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,910
Your Majesty, this is...

85
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:40,380
My daughter Elizabeth. You don't need to tell me.

86
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,190
Come here, child.

87
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,940
Votre Majeste.

88
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,880
ca va

89
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,850
ca va bien, ma petite.

90
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,780
veniez ici

91
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,630
attencion

92
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,840
joyeux son famille

93
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,790
Your Majesty, Mr. Robert Aske.

94
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,820
- Majesty.	- Mr.Aske.

95
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,510
Come.

96
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,450
I am very glad to see you, Mr. Aske.

97
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,170
For a long time, I believed I was badly misinformed

98
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,530
about the causes of disturbances in the Northern part of our kingdom.

99
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,940
but I have read your full and frank explanation.

100
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,240
I am persuaded by the justice of your cause.

101
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,250
I still deem the commonwealth of the realm, and love of my subjects,

102
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,740
Mr. Aske, far more than any riches

103
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,160
I'm truely humbled by Your Majesty's words.

104
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,290
and ask in all you ability.

105
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:44,030
If your sacred Majesty intends to fulfill those pledges made in Your Majesty's name,

106
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:48,560
by his grace, the Duke of Suffolk at Pontefract.

107
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,240
In every part, the general and liberal pardon

108
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,070
shall be extended to all our Northern subjects.

109
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,090
There will be a free election to a Parliament to be held at York.

110
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,870
when members of churchmen without our displeasure,

111
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,620
shall them may speak and show their learning and their free minds.

112
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,580
Futhermore, after my Lord Suffolk has come down to you

113
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,680
with the great seal to claim on this,

114
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,510
then to show the great love we bear on the Northern subjects.

115
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,950
we ourselves shall come to York.

116
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:27,840
and it is there, Mr. Aske, where my Queen shall be crowned.

117
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,720
Your Majesty is truely gracious.

118
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:36,280
I swear to you. You will find no more loving and loyal people

119
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,560
on the whole of your realm than Northern Yorkshire.

120
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:45,050
One more thing. You've written against some of my advisors,

121
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,020
and protesting at their lack of noble blood.

122
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,910
Your Majesty, I...

123
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:57,000
No, I agree with you. But don't say anything.

124
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,880
Now, I have a gift for you.

125
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,030
Majesty, I...

126
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,780
Happy Christmas, Mr. Aske.

127
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,850
That is quite entertaining.

128
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,460
but you don't even know who I am, do you?

129
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,120
Of course, I do.

130
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,970
You're Edward Seymour's wife.

131
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,280
If he ever discovered us, he'd probably kill you.

132
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,200
Really? Yet he seems so nice.

133
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:28,040
Cold, perhaps but pleasant with all?

134
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,140
That's a mistake they all make.

135
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:46,210
Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum, Amen

136
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,900
Mr. Aske.

137
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,260
Lady Mary.

138
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,520
I'm sorry to disturb your prayers.

139
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:14,070
Not at all, since you are always a part of them.

140
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,150
I come only to assure you, Mr. Aske.

141
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,670
For i know you are here upon God's work.

142
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:24,230
I trust the King's Majesty will grant you and your people all their desires.

143
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,910
I have every hope now,

144
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:30,620
as i have ever hoped one day you will succeed as Queen of England,

145
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,420
for the better maintaining of our faith.

146
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,680
Lady, you must know,

147
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,820
how beloved you are to the people,

148
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,220
as was your mother before you. God rest her soul.

149
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:56,380
Remember me by this.

150
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:02,860
May God bless and keep you, Master Aske.

151
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,500
How's father? They told me he has fallen ill

152
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:22,380
I was going tell you at a better time. Father is dead.

153
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:31,110
Dead? When? Why?

154
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,720
Keep smiling.  A week ago.

155
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,860
-A week? - Yes a week.

156
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,880
I arrange the funeral,everything has done to honor him.

157
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,990
You should have told me. I should have been there.

158
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,230
I wish I could be otherwise, but can't now,

159
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,480
your place is here,you have to understand that.

160
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,980
Later you could visit his mausoleum

161
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,050
-Sister.  - My Lady.

162
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,310
I presume you have told her about her father, is she alright

163
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,500
Of course. She's the queen.

164
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:28,890
Gentlemen.  Noble and worshipful man of this country.

165
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:33,010
I swear by the faith that I bear to God and St. George that i have not only

166
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:37,130
forgiven and pardoned the men of the North by writing under seal

167
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:41,260
but also freely in my heart.

168
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,610
It is my honor that those men now wear the cross of St. George

169
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,970
who thankfully accepted my free pardon

170
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:53,780
and mean to be as loyal subjects, as they were before their solely insurrection.

171
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:02,080
And my queen and I, wish you all, a very happy and prosperous New Year.

172
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,500
I tell you frankly, the King is a good and gracious lord

173
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:13,310
who has granted us as far as he may, all our desires and petitions.

174
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,640
It's true. I heard it from his own mouth

175
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,220
that he intends to hold a free and fair parliament in York

176
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,810
and have the queen crowned there.

177
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,240
Promises, Mr. Aske, just more promises.

178
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,020
No, not just promises.

179
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,650
Lord Suffolk is sworn to come here to bring both great authority,

180
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,410
the King's seal and thus he told me many comfortable answers.

181
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,660
I have to tell you, Mr. Aske, though it agrees me to do so,

182
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,910
that since you have been away,

183
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,600
there have been many rumors and a widespread

184
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,300
mistrust of the King and his councel.

185
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,610
Aye. The Northern lands are open monastery again

186
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,920
and this time we won't be betrayed.

187
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,630
Tell them to believe me, John.

188
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,040
Tell them to wait for the coming of Lord Suffolk,

189
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,450
for another rising now risks everything.

190
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:06,120
Robert, there was a time when nothing was more sure

191
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,800
than a promise of a prince, but now

192
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,710
we think these promises nothing but a policy to blind the people.

193
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:20,620
and when we rise again, we will trust no promises.

194
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,600
I cannot believe this.

195
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,370
If you will not trust the King, then will you at least trust me?

196
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,980
Have I not guided you well so far?

197
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,980
Have I not secured a pardon for all of us?

198
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:37,410
But have you secured the King's absolute promise to restore our monasteries?

199
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,830
His Grace promised me that all those matters would be discussed

200
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,760
freely and openly in parliament.

201
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,390
I trust him. He offered me as much as true and honest

202
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,020
and good man could desire of their sovereign.

203
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,450
but we have no proof.

204
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,890
Where are you going?

205
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:00,950
Marching on Carlisle.

206
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,540
John, I plead with you, for the love of God, not to put this agreement

207
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,130
in jeopardy by false actions and rush judgements.

208
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:12,580
Their minds are already made up, Mr. Aske. Even before you returned.

209
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,910
There is no agreement just basically empty promises.

210
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,510
The King will not be moved by words but by actions.

211
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,900
We shall do now, what we should have done before.

212
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,090
gather the man.

213
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:42,030
I wish that Lady Mary lived at the court. I miss her very much.

214
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,870
Yes, and Lady Elizabeth.

215
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,710
Is she not the sweetest,cleverest, brightest child?

216
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,510
It's not have been easy for either of them.

217
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,020
and for all my troubles I'm glad I never have theirs.

218
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,000
Your Majesty.

219
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:05,120
Madam. I do not know whether to tell you, but

220
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,620
the King has taken Lady Misseldon as mistress.

221
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:21,440
He must do as he will. It is we, Lady Rochford,

222
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,060
must always honor and obey.

223
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:36,890
Donot leave trouble for me, for I have great reason to be happy.

224
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,480
The Duke of Suffolk, and the Lord Privy Seal.

225
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,670
You're going to North at once.

226
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,710
Yes, Your Majesty.

227
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:26,270
In order to establish due obedience, you will allow minister an oath,

228
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:29,840
to the leaders and gentlemen of Yorkshire and Lancashire.

229
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,370
They will acknowledge that they made other oath contrary

230
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,900
to their allegiance and to the great offence of God.

231
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,750
They must utterly renounce them

232
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,860
and swear to be our true and faithful subjects.

233
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:47,530
They must commit themselves to obey and even to spill their blood to maintain

234
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:51,780
all our laws and to assist our church commissioners in their duties.

235
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:56,980
If they will not take the oath, then there will be no clemency.

236
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,840
You will apprehend such persons where there is no danger to yourself. And they will,

237
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,700
by law, be judged to suffer execution.

238
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,820
Your Majesty, what are your instructions

239
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,460
regarding the setting of the parliament at York?

240
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,890
You may say there has been necessary delays.

241
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:25,920
Your Majesty, I...I gave them my word upon my honor.

242
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,060
Let me remind  Your Grace that rebellion

243
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:33,200
is the heinous sin which cries out to God for punishment.

244
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,340
It is the sin of the sin.

245
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,460
For wether is no right order, there is only carnal liberty,

246
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,590
sin and Babylonian disorder.

247
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:45,820
These wretched men have taken my whole realm without board

248
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,050
as they have taken me, Charles.

249
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,590
They have to and will be punished for it.

250
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,200
I agree with Your Majesty. If I might...

251
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,030
No you may not. You're low birth,  Mr. Cromwell, deems you're unfit

252
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:09,870
to meddle in the affairs of King's. You dismissed.

253
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,560
-Hey Charlie.    -Captain Constable.

254
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,750
So most men start together. You're in good spirit.

255
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,090
Aye, glad you are up for it

256
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,600
Good, the rest will be joining in us tomorrow.

257
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:43,790
We will walk in the carlisle, we will attack the castle as soon as fast

258
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,240
what we've got here

259
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,710
Rabbits.

260
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:53,150
Rabbits. So what are you going to do with that? Feed the five thousand?

261
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:31,100
Jesus! Charlie! Stay low!

262
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:41,010
out out

263
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,620
alright

264
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,510
Give him some water.

265
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,940
My God, what in God's name has happened?

266
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,890
We started together, Mr. Aske,near Carlisle,

267
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,630
ready and eager to,

268
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,370
assault the castle.

269
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,760
Then Sir Cristopher Dacre. and the Lord Suffolk,

270
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,160
came out of the castle with the men that brought these spears on those

271
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,560
and afterwards, men of bloody chains and captures, scalds

272
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,420
I saw my two boy slayed.

273
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,760
God help us.

274
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,440
Sirs we are broken.

275
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,880
What about Mr. Constable?

276
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,010
Captured.

277
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,910
My Lord.

278
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:55,740
We've got him. They broke their pledges.

279
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,410
-I mean to see the King.  -Yes, My Lord

280
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:02,070
We shall impose martial law on whole of the North.

281
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,900
-John Constable?   -Aye.

282
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,270
Do you deny that you acted as a leader in captains of this rebellion?

283
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,640
No. I'm proud of it.

284
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:51,320
You're going to be taken to London and examined further as your action's motives.

285
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,810
you mean tortured, you promised us a parliament,

286
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:59,720
but you lied. you betrayed us

287
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:05,490
You never meant to of everything, did you, did you, Your Grace?

288
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,900
Here are the names of those who refuse to announce their actions and sign the oath.

289
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:21,760
-How many?   -74, all to be executed, Your Grace.

290
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,810
It was all well done Your Grace.

291
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,030
You know that it is his Majesty's order to arrest Lord Darcy

292
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,660
Sir Ralph Ellerker and Robert Aske.

293
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,910
They are to be charged on suspicion of treason

294
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,160
but they must not know it.

295
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,040
Your Grace must surely know

296
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,370
that Mr.Aske Sir.Ralph and I

297
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:53,030
were firmly and factly and openly  against this new rising.

298
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,890
We believed and believe still in the promises

299
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:00,140
and assureties and good gracious of the King's Majesty.

300
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:06,210
It is also true that nothing can be done or imagined here against the King's Majesty

301
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,030
that I cannot let the council and you know of.

302
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,920
I am assured of your loyalty to his Majesty.

303
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,640
Nevertheless, the King requires you travel south

304
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,760
with me to explain this recent events

305
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,440
which seems so contrary to his expressed hopes.

306
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,590
Your Grace can see with your own eyes

307
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:28,870
that I am old and sick and unfit to travel

308
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,930
Allow me to speak openly to Your Grace.

309
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:40,670
although I love and trust the King absolutely

310
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:45,400
and know that he would always treat me justly and mercifully.

311
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,140
I can not say the same for some of his councillors.

312
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:54,940
I would rather fear to fall into their hands my Lord.

313
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,460
Allow me to reassure you.

314
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:04,350
I will write a letter to both the King and council in all of your favours

315
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,090
and shall we show you before we leave.

316
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:14,770
Then, we must go.

317
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:18,600
Yes, it is the King's command.

318
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:26,710
Then I say God has mercy on us.

319
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,180
God bless you and keep you, my own dear husband.

320
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,030
And you too my darlings, but I shall be all right

321
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,710
for I trust in the honestly of His Grace.

322
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:54,510
He showed me a letter, it was written

323
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,310
to the council on our behalf and it was all good.

324
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:00,750
He said he still charity for us and I doubt

325
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,610
any harm will come to us.

326
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,920
After all, what could be gained by when the North most now

327
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,760
be appeased and quiet.

328
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:15,850
Then our daughters don't weap. Your yorkshire lass,

329
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:20,990
Yorkshire lass have iron in their souls just like your good mother.

330
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:33,120
You will see me again soon, I promise.

331
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,540
God bless you Mr.aske

332
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,830
God bless you Mr.aske

333
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:48,210
Man,march on.

334
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:57,200
God bless you Mr.aske

335
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,450
I see you eating quail's eggs again sweetheat?

336
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,630
Did you not have those yesterday.

337
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,770
Yes, Your Majesty.

338
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,290
I seemed to have developed  fondness of them.

339
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,900
Especial fondness?

340
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,220
Well indeed.

341
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:30,890
For some seasons, I desire quails eggs above anything else.

342
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:35,480
-Leave. -Your Majesty

343
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:53,090
I think you are with child.

344
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,330
I am.

345
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,170
My love.

346
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,890
My queen.

347
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,180
John Constable

348
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:36,080
you are a principal and irredeemable traitor and villian against the King's Majesty.

349
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,490
Nothing can save you.

350
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:42,810
OH Lord. forgive me, oh Lord

351
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:45,100
Guards,hold him down on the table.

352
00:34:45,100 --> 00:35:00,420
Sweet jesus, God, jesus,

353
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,010
Dame you to hell. ...

354
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:13,140
...Lord Darcy Your Grace I think the journey almost broken him

355
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,340
His lodge is taken care of.

356
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,170
This is Sir Francis Bryan.

357
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:21,980
-Mr. Aske.  -Sir Francis.

358
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,300
I have orders to commit you to the tower.

359
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,480
-but  -it's for your own safety.

360
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,890
You will be lodged comfortably enough.

361
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:39,460
Mr Cromwell desires to ask you a few questions.

362
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,130
I trusted you, Your Grace.

363
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:49,940
I swear, I have done my best for you, Mr. Aske.

364
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,840
The Duke of Suffolk, my Lord.

365
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,740
You asked to see me.

366
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,290
Yes Your Grace.

367
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,730
Well explain yourself, what do you want?

368
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,250
I have some reports.

369
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,940
You always have reports Cromwell.

370
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,090
But these are very interesting.

371
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,240
they are reports from insides of Carlisle

372
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,390
where he says a judgement agaginst rebels who attempeted to threaten His Majesty.

373
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,340
Everything was done leagally and properly.

374
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,290
74 rebels were jedgued and hanged.

375
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,720
That's the problem.

376
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,380
one point all of us agreed there were at least

377
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,050
40,000 rebles armed and in the field

378
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:56,350
and yet Your Grace found only 74 guilty.

379
00:36:56,350 --> 00:37:00,600
I hanged those with the leaders and most guilty insides rebellion.

380
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,850
Had you actually been there to hear the evidence?

381
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:09,040
I must be honest with Your Grace, you had been accused of too great

382
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,330
of leniency towards the rebels,towards

383
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:18,960
recalcitrant monks and other upholders of the old religion, it...

384
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,570
it is disreputed whether you are in your heart and soul

385
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:28,190
fully engaged in struggle against the treasons, rebels or Wheather you are

386
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:32,220
in your heart still papist

387
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,050
Who? Accused me?

388
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,220
His Majesty.

389
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:47,620
Consequently, his Majesty now demands your return North

390
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:52,830
and carry out an proper and efficient reprisals against these rebels and treators

391
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:56,290
You are to make a terribly examples of them.

392
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:59,750
And teach those parts of the virtues of loyalty.

393
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:07,890
74 is an inadequate number

394
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,890
Your Grace

395
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:22,790
Since you asked me for the truth,I will answer that in all parts of the realm

396
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,360
men's heart were most hurt by the destruction of the abbeyes

397
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,800
Becuase they thought perhaps with a reason that

398
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,240
this was the first fruits, of the destruction,of their whole religion in England

399
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:39,040
This letter of yours

400
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:44,480
on the 19th of Jan., you wrote to reassure the mayor of common Pontefract

401
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,410
"I should keep a clean true heart to God on the King

402
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:53,290
and whatever more further to be a true petitioner for the common wealth good."

403
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,280
You signed it.T Dacy?

404
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,650
I remember it. But I am not sure, what is wrong with it.

405
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:05,120
Can you not agree, was it rather spreading fauls foolingness*

406
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:11,320
for example,the parish churches we're going to put down which actully caused rebellion

407
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:17,220
No, it was the fact, that the abbeys were being suppressed and burned.

408
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:22,030
It was 19th of Jan that after the King declared his Pardon and rebellion had ended.

409
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:25,070
but I understood the King had also agreed to a free paliament

410
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:28,340
where subjests could still show their grief complains

411
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,210
my letter was only meant to

412
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,840
I will tell you what it meant, my Lord.

413
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,480
What it meant is even after the King's gracious pardon,

414
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,190
you had not changed your traitor's heart and opinions

415
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,370
You continue to seek the annulment of laws

416
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,560
that make for the good of the commonwealth

417
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,120
and you still wish to depose the King.

418
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:53,800
Tell me, why... they were so important to you?

419
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:58,180
Because the abbeys in the North gave arms to poor men

420
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,620
and Lord belief to serve God.

421
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,440
They were one of the beautiest of this realm

422
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,150
to all men and strangers are alike.

423
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:13,390
They took care of their servants, their tends,

424
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:17,760
and their local communities in every sort of way.

425
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,390
From maintaining bridges and seawalls.

426
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,780
to see girls and boys were brought up in virtue

427
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:31,070
And when they stood, people not only has world of refreshment in their bodies,

428
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,820
but they also have a spirtual refuge.

429
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:41,740
So you grudge this suppression and the King's supremacy

430
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:50,510
After such confessions, Lord forgive us.

431
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:54,230
It is not Mr. Aske but you,

432
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:59,900
who are the very oringal and chief cause of all this rebellion and mischief

433
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,930
although You could probably find some ways of having all

434
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,970
the nobal men's head of the realm struck off you if you wanted.

435
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:12,020
yet I trust, there might be on left

436
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,750
who can still to strike off yours.

437
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:31,990
well, may it surprise you to learn, Mr. Aske,

438
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,750
there is very reason, I attempt to save you.

439
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,840
You've been here for 2 days. But still you don't talk to me.

440
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:21,720
Even though you are unhappy.

441
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,810
How'd you know?

442
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:28,550
You wake in the night. You say things.

443
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,830
What do I say?

444
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:36,690
unburden your heart.

445
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:48,210
If I do, believe me, everything will change.

446
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:06,510
I am commanded to return North to carry out retribution.

447
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,580
I must excute more rebels.

448
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,000
Only this time I'll trial "proper" process.

449
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,490
Many?

450
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:20,310
Yes, many. Many, hundreds, thousands,

451
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:22,410
I must kill hundreds of men, women or children

452
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:24,520
or I'll lose the love of my King.

453
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,810
Women and children?

454
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:28,730
I have no choice.

455
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:31,360
Of course you have choice!

456
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,990
What if they were your own children?!

457
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,870
I will still have to do it.

458
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,670
His Majesty, the King.

459
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,100
Stand up, Mr. Aske.

460
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:28,930
Mr. Cromwell has reported your words to me.

461
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:30,750
I've come to talk to you.

462
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:36,200
About the abbeys and the religious houses you care so much about.

463
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,720
Please.

464
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,160
You have so much affection for these monks.

465
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,630
Yet I can prove to you how far they are from good religious men.

466
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:06,820
They claim to live in willful poverty, chastity and obedience.

467
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,070
Yet they mass possessions.

468
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:11,260
And put themselves outside the law,

469
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,030
They are religion princes.

470
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:17,770
*Yet but out our responsibilities.*

471
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:20,720
And what is willful poverty anyway?

472
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:24,690
And that's for obedience, God help us.

473
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:28,000
How can they be obedient

474
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,130
when they disobliged their sovereign Lord

475
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:34,370
whom by God's commandments they ought to obey in all things.

476
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:40,410
We should not think of these men as good religious men

477
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:43,770
who forsake all earthly possessions as they claim.

478
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:49,890
But rather as idle and sturdy vagabonds.

479
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:59,430
I like you Mr.Aske

480
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:03,270
You're maybe misguiding certain matters, yes but,

481
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:07,120
your mistakes are honest.

482
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:16,330
I know that in your heart your are the most loyal of all men.

483
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:20,270
I love and respect Your Majesty, above all things.

484
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:23,960
I would never seek to offend you

485
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:58,890
Majesty, the bellman from Calais is here.

486
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:02,940
- Majesty.  - Monsieur. Let me see.

487
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:15,520
- Majesty.  - quail eggs, Sir Francis, quail eggs,

488
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:21,400
To feed the queen. Monsieur.

489
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:28,590
You're bound by law to obey the King's Majesty.

490
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:31,170
And yet you follow the traitor Aske

491
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:36,340
Robert Aske, you've been accused of levying war.

492
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,400
We find you guilty as charged.

493
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:40,880
You do not deserve this. Stop it.

494
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,560
You are a good man Robert Aske

495
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,310
I want you to organize the celebrations for the birth of my son.

496
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:48,300
I want them to be truely spectacular.

497
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,640
- Is it time?  - Yes, Your Majesty.

498
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:54,820
I pray to Jesus he wills to send us a prince.

499
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:03,460
Your Majesty may have to decide soon between the life of the mother or of the child.
