1
00:01:19,687 --> 00:01:20,581
Leave us!

2
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,286
Charles, please, sit.

3
00:01:30,913 --> 00:01:33,171
The factions and the fighting
that went on inside this Court

4
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,014
while I mourned were unacceptable.

5
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:38,694
I'm appointing you President of the
Council and Lord Great Master,

6
00:01:39,089 --> 00:01:40,424
so, in my absence,

7
00:01:40,884 --> 00:01:42,698
all will be answerable to you.

8
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,345
Not Cromwell.

9
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:46,773
Majesty.

10
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:51,186
I'm also appointing Edward Seymour, to
investigate the activities of the Poles.

11
00:01:51,306 --> 00:01:53,692
From now on, they're
all under suspicion.

12
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,588
How's your family?

13
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,853
They're well,

14
00:02:13,253 --> 00:02:14,104
except...

15
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:18,249
my wife lost the child
she was carrying.

16
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:26,607
Then we have both lost something.

17
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:36,075
Sometimes I think I shall go mad.

18
00:02:38,345 --> 00:02:40,410
My leg is poisoned and hurts again,

19
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,440
I'm afraid that my son will die
of The Plague, and I cannot sleep.

20
00:02:46,727 --> 00:02:47,620
Majesty...

21
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,574
I know what it is that
we have both lost.

22
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,742
We've lost our youth.

23
00:02:59,475 --> 00:03:02,489
There is nothing in the world,
that can ever return it to us.

24
00:03:09,462 --> 00:03:12,167
"Beneditione tuam Domine,

25
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:14,449
"populos Fideles accipiat."

26
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,879
- "Per Christum Dominum nostrum."
- "Amen!"

27
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:20,661
Lady Salisbury!

28
00:03:22,014 --> 00:03:23,456
You're hungry!
Eat!

29
00:03:27,715 --> 00:03:29,278
- Stop, sir!
- Stand aside,

30
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:30,692
I'm on the King's business!

31
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:32,547
- What's that?
- I don't know.

32
00:03:37,957 --> 00:03:40,139
Lady Salisbury,
forgive this intrusion,

33
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:42,859
but you and these members
of your family are arrested,

34
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:45,144
By the King's orders,
on suspicion of treason.

35
00:03:45,304 --> 00:03:47,147
You will all have to come
straight with me.

36
00:03:48,268 --> 00:03:49,683
Not my grandson, surely.

37
00:03:53,717 --> 00:03:54,444
All.

38
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:05,060
I wanted to talk to you in private,
Monsieur l'Ambassadeur,

39
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,404
because I'm inclined
towards a French bride.

40
00:04:07,524 --> 00:04:10,739
Although my advisors think I should
rather seek an Imperial match.

41
00:04:11,238 --> 00:04:13,512
Ah, I admire your Majesty's taste,

42
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:16,234
and deplore that of your advisers.

43
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:19,443
Perhaps they are not men
of the world, as we are?

44
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:23,622
My Lord of the Privy Seal spoke
to me of two potential French brides:

45
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,083
Maria, the King's daughter,

46
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,195
and Marie de Guise,

47
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:30,655
Madame de Longueville.

48
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:33,767
Since I have heard further
of Madame de Longueville,

49
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:36,384
I cannot refrain from
considering her as a wife.

50
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:38,527
Good nose.
Peachy!

51
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:41,325
Cat's piss.

52
00:04:42,222 --> 00:04:43,388
Not too sweet.

53
00:04:46,771 --> 00:04:48,165
What have you heard?

54
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,753
The King's daughter's too young for me.

55
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,045
But Madame de Longueville
is more suitable,

56
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:56,841
being herself a widow, and
having already born two sons,

57
00:04:57,001 --> 00:04:59,045
and being, as they say, very...

58
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:01,389
voluptuous.

59
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:06,888
My master told me that He
would think it a great honour,

60
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:10,056
if your Majesty were to take
a French girl as your new wife.

61
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:12,648
There is no Lady who
is not at His command,

62
00:05:13,572 --> 00:05:16,042
except Madame de Longueville,

63
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,488
Whose marriage to the King of
Scotland,

64
00:05:19,648 --> 00:05:21,156
has already been arranged.

65
00:05:21,494 --> 00:05:23,067
This arrangement can be broken.

66
00:05:24,488 --> 00:05:26,913
Tell your Master that I can do
twice as much for Him

67
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:29,706
as my nephew, the idiotic
and beggarly Scotish King.

68
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,698
Yes.

69
00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:33,281
Yes, but so, in effect,

70
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:37,213
then, you would be marrying
another man's wife.

71
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:38,971
I will marry who I like!

72
00:05:40,255 --> 00:05:41,550
Monsieur Castillon,

73
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:44,450
I have received offers
from every quarter.

74
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,827
Forgive me,

75
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:48,657
but His Majesty proposes
a double marriage.

76
00:05:48,964 --> 00:05:51,825
His 19 year old son, Henri,
to your daughter, Mary,

77
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:55,355
and one of Madame Longeville's
sisters to you.

78
00:05:56,429 --> 00:05:59,039
There are two of them:
Louise and Renné.

79
00:06:00,054 --> 00:06:03,122
The former, remarkably
for the French Court,

80
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,691
is a rumoured to be still a virgin.

81
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:10,981
Wonderful!

82
00:06:12,098 --> 00:06:14,107
Take Her.
Take Louise.

83
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,361
Since she is still a maid,
you will have the advantage of...

84
00:06:19,057 --> 00:06:21,597
shaping the passage to your measure.

85
00:06:50,731 --> 00:06:52,210
I wanna see my father!

86
00:06:57,303 --> 00:06:58,836
Go get my father!

87
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,566
I want my father NOW!!

88
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:07,849
You know who I am?
Don't you?

89
00:07:08,198 --> 00:07:11,667
Oh, yes! I know who you are.
You're Master Pole.

90
00:07:11,955 --> 00:07:14,020
{\They say that }Some day you're gonna be
the King of England.

91
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,251
Let go of me!
Let go!

92
00:07:18,974 --> 00:07:20,411
We must discuss marriage.

93
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:23,997
As usual, the French
want to mess Me around.

94
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,001
Who does the Emperor propose?

95
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:29,956
Your Majesty, the Emperor has
put forward Christina, His niece,

96
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:31,684
the Duchess of Milan.

97
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:33,908
Tell me about Her.

98
00:07:34,028 --> 00:07:35,671
Originally from Denmark,

99
00:07:36,354 --> 00:07:40,052
she was married at 13 to the
Duke of Milan, Francesco Sforza,

100
00:07:40,172 --> 00:07:41,600
who died a year later.

101
00:07:42,346 --> 00:07:46,112
She is now 16, both a widow,
and, apparently, still a maid.

102
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,866
She's living in Brussels,
with the Regent, Mary of Hungary.

103
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,101
She's reported to be a great beauty,

104
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,601
and likes nothing better than
hunting and playing cards.

105
00:07:56,698 --> 00:07:58,317
Hunting and playing cards.

106
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:00,728
I like Her already.

107
00:08:02,823 --> 00:08:05,421
Have Our Ambassador in the Netherlands
find out more about her.

108
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:07,296
Majesty.

109
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:20,650
{\My Lord, }Our Ambassador to the
Netherlands, Sir John Hutton.

110
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:22,019
Ah, Sir John...

111
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:22,992
I...

112
00:08:24,156 --> 00:08:26,464
have some most urgent
business for you to do.

113
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:28,579
My Lord, Mr. Islick has warned me.

114
00:08:31,172 --> 00:08:34,851
You are to make a list of potential
candidates to share His Majesty's bed.

115
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:36,534
My Lord,

116
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:40,276
I have not much
experience among ladies,

117
00:08:40,856 --> 00:08:43,685
there fore, this commission
to me is hard.

118
00:08:46,006 --> 00:08:47,457
You're to go to Brussels.

119
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:52,222
You're to make {\particular }inquiries there about
Christina, Duchess of Milan, but...

120
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:54,828
while you're about it,
go on to the Duchy of Cleves,

121
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,091
make enquiries there about the
Duke's two sisters: Amelia and Anne.

122
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,459
I'm anxious that they
should enter the reckoning.

123
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,177
Yes, my Lord Cromwell.

124
00:09:16,114 --> 00:09:17,350
I wanna see my son.

125
00:09:18,161 --> 00:09:20,486
What have you done with my son?
Where is he?

126
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:21,813
Your son is unharmed.

127
00:09:22,843 --> 00:09:26,122
He will remain unharmed until we are
sure that you are not all traitors,

128
00:09:26,242 --> 00:09:27,830
like your brother, Reginald.

129
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,684
You know very well that my
family has disowned Reginald.

130
00:09:32,256 --> 00:09:35,210
Neither my mother nor I support or
condones what he has done.

131
00:09:35,794 --> 00:09:39,548
We'll openly profess our
allegiance to His Gracious Majesty.

132
00:09:45,688 --> 00:09:48,046
I like well the precedings of
my brother,

133
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,424
the Cardinal,

134
00:09:50,404 --> 00:09:52,776
but I like not the doings
of this Realm,

135
00:09:53,614 --> 00:09:55,986
and I trust to see
a change in this world.

136
00:09:56,586 --> 00:09:59,098
I would wish that we
were both over the sea.

137
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:03,672
The world in England
waxes all crooked.

138
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,983
The God's Law has been
turned upside-down,

139
00:10:07,143 --> 00:10:09,110
abbeys and churches overthrown.

140
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,362
Who gave you that letter?

141
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:13,089
Do you deny writing it?

142
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:17,894
It has a postscript:

143
00:10:18,592 --> 00:10:20,627
"The King will die
one day, suddenly."

144
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,498
"His leg will kill Him,"

145
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:25,990
"and we will have a jolly...
stirring!"

146
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:32,581
Your professions of loyalty were
all hollow,

147
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,142
my Lord Montague.

148
00:10:35,314 --> 00:10:37,347
You are, after all,
the King's cousins.

149
00:10:37,507 --> 00:10:40,603
The last of the Plantagenets.
The last of the White Rose.

150
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,395
Some say you Poles,
are the rightfull heirs,

151
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:47,944
and will someday wear the garland.
Don't they.

152
00:11:40,558 --> 00:11:41,828
Sir Francis.

153
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:44,256
Majesty.

154
00:11:49,521 --> 00:11:52,359
Now that we found evidence against
Henry Pole, Lord Montague,

155
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,390
we need something against the Lady.

156
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,391
I ask you, whether such dishonest
and treacherous sons

157
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:00,576
could ever have had
an honest mother!

158
00:12:07,052 --> 00:12:08,029
Who is that?

159
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,280
She's the widow of the
Earl of Edgemont.

160
00:12:11,642 --> 00:12:12,536
A widow?

161
00:12:15,112 --> 00:12:17,819
Wait. It's true she
doesn't look it, but...

162
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:19,906
she's over 40.

163
00:12:22,891 --> 00:12:25,269
On the other hand,
there is a maid at Court,

164
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:28,849
she's only 14, but she already
has a goodly stature.

165
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:32,962
Let the fruit ripen before
you pluck it, Sir Francis.

166
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,477
- My Lord.
- My Lord Cromwell.

167
00:12:47,618 --> 00:12:49,265
- Majesty.
- Cromwell.

168
00:12:51,483 --> 00:12:53,872
I've just received a
letter from Sir John Hutton,

169
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:55,633
The ambassador in Brussels.

170
00:12:56,371 --> 00:12:58,693
He's been making enquiries
on your Majesty's behalf

171
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:01,115
about the Duchess of Milan,
the Emperor's niece.

172
00:13:02,753 --> 00:13:03,909
What does he say?

173
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:06,571
He writes,
"There's none in these parts"

174
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:09,699
"for beauty of person and birth
to compare with the Duchess."

175
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:12,945
"She's not so pure white as the
last Queen (God pardon), but"

176
00:13:13,313 --> 00:13:16,937
"when she smiles there appear 2 dimples
in Her cheeks and one in Her chin."

177
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:18,871
"And we're very well."

178
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:22,803
Has He mentioned other Ladies?

179
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:24,320
Only a...

180
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:27,620
sister of the Duke of Cleves: Anne.

181
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:30,061
- He writes.
- I've heard about Her.

182
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:33,497
They say she's of no great praise,
either of Her personage or Her beauty.

183
00:13:36,134 --> 00:13:37,669
Forgive me, Majesty, but...

184
00:13:38,658 --> 00:13:41,864
on the other hand, such a match
could have its advantages.

185
00:13:43,206 --> 00:13:45,499
This Realm has long been at
the mercy of the machinations

186
00:13:45,619 --> 00:13:47,331
of the French or of the Emperor,

187
00:13:47,988 --> 00:13:50,683
but Cleves is a member of
The Protestant League,

188
00:13:50,803 --> 00:13:52,664
which daily grows in power
across Europe,

189
00:13:52,784 --> 00:13:54,210
and could easily, rival with us.

190
00:13:54,785 --> 00:13:56,228
Thus, at last,

191
00:13:57,219 --> 00:13:59,619
could England
make its own destiny.

192
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:04,951
Even so,

193
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,432
I'm anxious to see
more about the Duchess of Milan.

194
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,757
I want to be sure she is
as beautiful as Hutton claims.

195
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:16,524
Send Master Holbein to do
a sketch of her by next tide.

196
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:19,760
- Majesty.
- Master Cromwell.

197
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:43,926
With your permission, Madam,

198
00:14:44,086 --> 00:14:47,221
may I ask if you would consider
marrying the King?

199
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:49,012
You may ask, Sir.

200
00:14:49,361 --> 00:14:53,115
And as for my inclination, you know
I am at the Emperor's command.

201
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:57,064
Madam, how happy you shall be
if it be your chance to be

202
00:14:57,594 --> 00:14:59,149
matched with my Master.

203
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:00,328
Shall I?

204
00:15:00,844 --> 00:15:01,633
Why?

205
00:15:03,132 --> 00:15:06,956
My Royal Master is the most
gentle gentleman that lives.

206
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:10,400
His nature is so benign
and pleasant, that

207
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:13,568
'til this day, I think no man
has heard many,

208
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:16,010
if any angry words pass His mouth.

209
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:22,712
On the other hand, it is not strange
that the King's Majesty was

210
00:15:22,832 --> 00:15:26,044
in so little space, rid
of His 3 Queens?

211
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,624
And I suspect, that the first,

212
00:15:29,744 --> 00:15:31,920
my great aunt, was poisoned,

213
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:34,858
the second, innocently put to death,

214
00:15:35,258 --> 00:15:39,250
and the third lost for lack
of care in Her child-bed.

215
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:43,022
Frankly, Sir, if I had two heads,

216
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,579
then one would be at
his Majesty's service.

217
00:15:46,262 --> 00:15:48,355
Alas, I only have this one.

218
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:53,258
Madam, let me plead my
Master's better qualities,

219
00:15:53,378 --> 00:15:55,240
- and appeal to your heart.
- No!

220
00:15:55,816 --> 00:15:57,531
You must not labour any further,

221
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:00,281
for I shall not fix
my heart that way.

222
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,809
Unless, of course,

223
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,195
the Emperor commands me to.

224
00:16:17,512 --> 00:16:18,356
Madam.

225
00:16:41,789 --> 00:16:42,863
Sir Francis!

226
00:16:49,144 --> 00:16:51,098
The Royal Banner
of the Plantagenets.

227
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:53,986
My God, what expectation is there!

228
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,474
What's this?

229
00:17:09,564 --> 00:17:10,913
The Royal Banner.

230
00:17:11,471 --> 00:17:12,420
And this...

231
00:17:12,978 --> 00:17:15,279
The most potent symbol of rebellion.

232
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,311
Discovered in your house.

233
00:17:18,114 --> 00:17:18,806
Sir,

234
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:21,593
I am an old Lady.

235
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:25,219
I have done nothing wrong or
against the King's Majesty.

236
00:17:25,466 --> 00:17:27,922
You still communicate with
your son, Reginald Pole!

237
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:30,332
Despite him being a traitor.

238
00:17:31,294 --> 00:17:33,303
No doubt you plot new
treacheries with him.

239
00:17:33,464 --> 00:17:37,450
How can you suposse that at my age,
I am capable of plotting anything

240
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,770
against anyone?

241
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:42,479
I wish only to live a quiet life,
away from this world.

242
00:17:44,427 --> 00:17:46,297
If the King in His mercy could

243
00:17:46,827 --> 00:17:48,404
show pity and forgive us.

244
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:49,984
Madam,

245
00:17:50,472 --> 00:17:53,577
you have all been attainted for
High Treason against His Majesty.

246
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,584
The evidence is great against you.

247
00:17:57,405 --> 00:17:59,024
For what you deserve,

248
00:17:59,443 --> 00:18:00,978
you may well beg mercy,

249
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,285
but whom shall say if
it be granted or not.

250
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:13,808
Grandmother,
where are you?

251
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,854
Grandmother!

252
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:25,670
The Duchess of Milan is enchanting.

253
00:18:26,842 --> 00:18:28,489
I am singularly pleased.

254
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,946
This picture makes Her
look very pretty, very...

255
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:34,360
full of life.

256
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:36,816
Keep your hands off her, Charles!

257
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:45,319
After our wedding,
our younger sons will be enobled

258
00:18:45,444 --> 00:18:48,690
with the ancient Dukedoms of York,
Gloucester and Somerset,

259
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:52,658
and Princess Mary can marry
Dom Luís.

260
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:00,928
That's what you want,
isn't it, Charles?

261
00:19:01,753 --> 00:19:03,253
An Imperial wedding.

262
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:06,479
Just as Wolsey always wanted
a french one.

263
00:19:08,217 --> 00:19:11,517
Everyone has an agenda!
And what I want doesn't matter!

264
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,196
The Poles have an agenda.

265
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,774
People talk about that poor little boy
in The Tower,

266
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:18,490
and poor old Lady Salisbury.

267
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,740
But let me tell you, they have
Plantagenet blood in their veins!

268
00:19:22,075 --> 00:19:23,373
And my father told me,

269
00:19:23,498 --> 00:19:26,429
My father told me that if you leave
even a sappling in the ground,

270
00:19:26,554 --> 00:19:28,137
one day it will grow into a tree!

271
00:19:28,262 --> 00:19:30,986
And that little boy in The Tower
will have 40,000 troops

272
00:19:31,111 --> 00:19:32,324
flocking to his banner,

273
00:19:32,449 --> 00:19:34,317
and you will be the sucker!

274
00:19:47,765 --> 00:19:49,162
Fetch the king's physician.

275
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:50,887
God's sake, man, run!

276
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:54,690
Charles!
Charles!

277
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:05,370
My Lord, what news of the king?

278
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,857
Have you heard?

279
00:20:10,383 --> 00:20:11,371
Is he recovered?

280
00:20:11,496 --> 00:20:13,996
- The king is dead.
- The king's not...

281
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:25,297
My Lord.

282
00:20:26,164 --> 00:20:28,014
- I must see the king.
- "Must"

283
00:20:28,184 --> 00:20:31,226
I may see your nephew, the Prince,
sometimes, but you prevent it.

284
00:20:31,436 --> 00:20:33,614
The king has lain ill
for over a week.

285
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,880
There has been no news about him.
So, there are rumors.

286
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:38,901
Some say the king is dead.

287
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:42,529
That would suit you, wouldn't it?
Since your nephew would be King.

288
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:46,384
He is a child!
That would be to no-one's use.

289
00:20:46,724 --> 00:20:49,674
Not to mine, not to yours,
and not to England's.

290
00:20:51,693 --> 00:20:53,782
With your permission, Your Grace,

291
00:20:53,907 --> 00:20:57,207
I would like the opportunity
to disprove those rumours.

292
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:02,331
Very well.

293
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:16,253
What in the name of God?

294
00:21:17,738 --> 00:21:20,613
This time, the ulce
in his leg has failed to burst,

295
00:21:20,902 --> 00:21:22,550
as it has always done before.

296
00:21:23,008 --> 00:21:25,697
Then fetch the barber-surgeons
to lance it.

297
00:21:25,865 --> 00:21:27,365
That might kill him!

298
00:21:32,945 --> 00:21:33,992
How is His Majesty?

299
00:21:34,117 --> 00:21:35,869
Double the guards around the prince.

300
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:37,979
No-one is to be allowed
access to him.

301
00:21:38,104 --> 00:21:39,204
Yes, m'Lord.

302
00:22:06,374 --> 00:22:09,735
Tell Sir Francis to take a
detachment of the Guard to Hunsdon,

303
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,535
so he and they may keep watch over
the Princess Mary with their lives.

304
00:22:16,478 --> 00:22:19,586
For, if the ring dies, some will be
for the boy, others for her.

305
00:22:19,901 --> 00:22:20,919
Yes, Your Grace.

306
00:22:44,026 --> 00:22:45,026
Oh, Lord!

307
00:22:48,228 --> 00:22:49,228
Lord.

308
00:22:52,176 --> 00:22:53,476
What shall I do?

309
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:26,084
Mr. Cromwell,
I bid you call for the surgeon-barbers.

310
00:23:28,296 --> 00:23:29,846
I will answer for it.

311
00:23:33,715 --> 00:23:35,015
Yes, Your Grace.

312
00:23:58,517 --> 00:24:00,317
Your Majesty, forgive me.

313
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:29,379
Soft, now.

314
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:43,997
How is the child?

315
00:25:44,165 --> 00:25:47,215
It is the sweetest, prettiest
boy that ever lived.

316
00:25:47,816 --> 00:25:49,016
Keep him safe.

317
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:52,158
- Mr. Cromwell...
- Majesty.

318
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,379
Have you spoken
to Castillon recently?

319
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,970
Yes, Majesty.

320
00:26:12,526 --> 00:26:14,569
What he said about
Madame de Longueville?

321
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:18,429
She has already got married...
to the king of Scotland.

322
00:26:19,598 --> 00:26:21,007
She'll regret it...

323
00:26:21,132 --> 00:26:23,800
when she sees what the
weather's like up there.

324
00:26:24,185 --> 00:26:26,309
The ambassador mentioned
there are two other cousins

325
00:26:26,434 --> 00:26:28,836
of King Francis, potentially
available to your Majesty.

326
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:31,377
Marie de Vendome
and Anne of Varennes.

327
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,594
Apparently,
Marie de Vendome has already

328
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:35,586
announced her intention
to become a nun,

329
00:26:35,711 --> 00:26:39,177
although Castillon thought that
not necessarily an obstacle.

330
00:26:39,747 --> 00:26:41,047
How very french!

331
00:26:43,158 --> 00:26:47,136
I need pictures! Do you understand?
I need to see them.

332
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:51,875
I need to see the woman
who's gonna be my companion for life.

333
00:26:58,194 --> 00:27:00,615
What of the negotiations
with the duchess of Milan?

334
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:03,233
There is the problem of affinity.

335
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:06,417
As niece of the emperor,

336
00:27:07,472 --> 00:27:10,022
the duchess is,
therefore, great-niece

337
00:27:10,147 --> 00:27:12,261
to Catherine of Aragon.

338
00:27:15,168 --> 00:27:18,544
In the past, such obstacles might have
been overcome by Papal dispensation...

339
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:21,119
Well, there's no question
of that now!

340
00:27:21,893 --> 00:27:23,882
But, perhaps,
as head of the church of England,

341
00:27:24,007 --> 00:27:27,157
the emperor will allow me...
to make a dispensation.

342
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,685
Yes, Majesty!
Naturally!

343
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:39,862
It'll take a good sport to
make me feel amorous again.

344
00:27:52,343 --> 00:27:54,639
I thought your husband warned
you to stay away from me?

345
00:27:54,764 --> 00:27:57,178
Oh, he did...
but now he doesn't care.

346
00:27:57,715 --> 00:27:59,671
He said he couldn't be
bothered to kill you.

347
00:27:59,796 --> 00:28:03,090
You know, the less I know about our
husband, the more he fascinates me.

348
00:28:03,768 --> 00:28:06,221
See, I know, more or less,
where most people stand.

349
00:28:06,346 --> 00:28:08,096
Like Suffolk, Cromwell...

350
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,101
I know their true beliefs,

351
00:28:10,226 --> 00:28:12,276
even if they try to hide them.

352
00:28:12,728 --> 00:28:15,895
But Edward... Who knows
what he truly believes.

353
00:28:16,565 --> 00:28:18,067
Would you like me to tell you?

354
00:28:18,235 --> 00:28:19,875
'For Services Rendered'!

355
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,852
You're not quite as good
as you think you are.

356
00:28:24,922 --> 00:28:27,141
That'still pretty good.
Tell me.

357
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:30,651
He believes in himself.

358
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,390
In his destiny.

359
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,916
Prince Edward is the key
to his destiny,

360
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,920
nothing will stand in his way.

361
00:28:38,747 --> 00:28:39,964
He's a reformer?

362
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:43,515
No, You can answer.
I am too. I swear.

363
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,598
Everyone knows
I hate popery with a passion.

364
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,630
That's why sometimes
they call me the black pope.

365
00:28:50,977 --> 00:28:54,311
Hello! I've just been fucked
by the pope!

366
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:58,266
In Nomine Patris, et Fili

367
00:28:58,391 --> 00:29:00,709
et Spiritis Sancti.

368
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:11,245
How does he think about Cromwell?

369
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,330
That, I don't know...

370
00:29:15,751 --> 00:29:16,751
but...

371
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:22,336
Did anyone ever discover
who shot Robert Packington, M.P.?

372
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:39,351
non temebo malem.
Amen.

373
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,050
My Lord Montague,

374
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,630
I am here to help you...
to a better place.

375
00:29:49,895 --> 00:29:52,295
You know I'm not guilty,
you bastard.

376
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,017
Only my brother is guilty,
but you can't touch him, can you,

377
00:29:56,142 --> 00:29:58,342
so you have to kill the innocent.

378
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,110
Your guilt has been established
beyond question.

379
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:03,074
There used to be procedures here,

380
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:04,891
proper legal procedures
in this country

381
00:30:05,016 --> 00:30:07,766
to establish who was
guilty and who was not.

382
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,660
But that's all gone, now.

383
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,670
You don't even have to have a trial.

384
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,096
So, since there is no judiciary,

385
00:30:19,373 --> 00:30:21,065
what's left is only tyranny.

386
00:30:27,143 --> 00:30:28,614
Where is my mother?

387
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,390
Lady Salisbury is...

388
00:30:32,586 --> 00:30:34,601
here within The Tower.

389
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,080
Please have a care for her,
my Lord Bishop.

390
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:42,419
Whatever she might have done,
be it so offensive,

391
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,645
she is an old and true woman,

392
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,670
and has always lived
under the precepts of God.

393
00:30:49,772 --> 00:30:52,172
I will have a...
tender care for her,

394
00:30:53,603 --> 00:30:55,500
body and soul, my Lord.

395
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:57,559
Trust me.

396
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,560
You know, my Lord,

397
00:31:04,023 --> 00:31:05,373
this the truth...

398
00:31:06,636 --> 00:31:10,483
the King never made a man,
but he destroyed him again.

399
00:31:11,862 --> 00:31:13,612
So take a care, my Lord.

400
00:31:22,785 --> 00:31:23,835
Come along!

401
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,345
I like more the look of some of
these french girls more than the others.

402
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,570
But can the likeness be trusted?

403
00:31:48,947 --> 00:31:52,490
Could the artist not use some licence
to either flatter the lady or please me?

404
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,390
Even Mr. Holbein.

405
00:31:56,138 --> 00:31:57,685
How can I make a decision on them

406
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,894
when I haven't met them
in the flesh?

407
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:01,248
Talk to Castillion.

408
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:02,410
Majes...

409
00:32:06,581 --> 00:32:09,617
If Your Majesty might still
choose to consider

410
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,760
the simple but profound charms of
Anne of Cleves, or of her sister,

411
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,086
and of the benefits
to you and this realm of a

412
00:32:16,211 --> 00:32:18,567
new alignment with
The Protestant League.

413
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:26,205
- His Grace, the Bishop of Winchester.
- My Lord Bishop.

414
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,330
Majesty.

415
00:32:41,372 --> 00:32:42,539
Your Majesty,

416
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,220
forgive me, but it has come
to my attention that

417
00:32:46,345 --> 00:32:49,544
certain Evangelicals
are still preaching

418
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:52,215
against the Six Articles of Faith,

419
00:32:52,945 --> 00:32:55,523
and Your Majesty's
religious agreement.

420
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:59,895
Mr. John Lambert is one such,

421
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:04,127
who preaches, once a week,
in London, to large audiences.

422
00:33:04,812 --> 00:33:06,939
Mr. Lambert denies

423
00:33:07,064 --> 00:33:08,978
the real presence of God

424
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,279
in the Sacrament of Communion.

425
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,712
Saying, rather, that it is merely

426
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:17,156
a symbolic commemoration

427
00:33:18,078 --> 00:33:19,828
of the Passion of Christ.

428
00:33:20,426 --> 00:33:22,778
Then Mr. Lambert will be condemned
in Christ's own words,

429
00:33:22,903 --> 00:33:25,020
who said: "This is my body."

430
00:33:26,585 --> 00:33:29,961
He will recant, or be burned.
I will not patron heretics.

431
00:33:36,127 --> 00:33:37,327
Is there more?

432
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,474
Perhaps, it is none of my business,

433
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,075
Your Majesty, but I am told that

434
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,856
Mr. Lambert is well known
to my Lord Cromwell.

435
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,125
It appears that they were educated
together at Cambridge,

436
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,950
and some six months ago,

437
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,520
when Lambert was aprehended,

438
00:33:58,157 --> 00:34:02,049
on suspicion of promoting
religious heresy,

439
00:34:04,844 --> 00:34:07,801
my Lord Cromwell had
the charges dismissed.

440
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:15,071
Thank you, my Lord Bishop.

441
00:34:27,311 --> 00:34:30,415
What news of the King's marriage
to the duchess of Milan?

442
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,290
Alas, princess, I think
it is not to happen.

443
00:34:34,545 --> 00:34:36,920
The duchess is the great-niece
of your mother,

444
00:34:37,045 --> 00:34:39,245
and so the affinity is too touch.

445
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:44,035
Also, I think the lady does not
want to marry the king

446
00:34:45,106 --> 00:34:46,106
Then...

447
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,123
I shall not marry Dom Luis?

448
00:34:51,528 --> 00:34:54,128
They say the king may now
marry a french lady,

449
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,970
and you,
one of the french king's sons.

450
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,175
Surely, that would not please you?

451
00:34:59,592 --> 00:35:02,595
Anything would please me,
my Lady, which made you happy.

452
00:35:04,193 --> 00:35:07,343
I'm afraid I was not born
for happiness, Excellency.

453
00:35:12,947 --> 00:35:15,947
I hear Lady Salisbury is being kept
in The Tower,

454
00:35:16,336 --> 00:35:17,886
and her son executed.

455
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:20,579
It is sadly so.

456
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:24,960
Her grandson, too,
is being kept a prisoner.

457
00:35:26,598 --> 00:35:28,948
I am sure
it is all Cromwell's doing.

458
00:35:31,104 --> 00:35:34,781
I should not say this to many people,
Excellency, but I say it to you...

459
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:38,390
as I agree with those who say
he is messenger of Satan.

460
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:41,009
I swear
he has poisoned the King's mind!

461
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,140
And if I could,

462
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,100
I would strip him
from the King's side,

463
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:48,375
and burn him.

464
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,530
His Excellency,
the french ambassador.

465
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,820
- Monsieur Castillion.
- Majesty.

466
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:06,287
We have been considering
all these candidates for our hand.

467
00:36:06,732 --> 00:36:10,723
- There are so many!
- Indeed, a warren of honourable Ladies.

468
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,250
Quite...

469
00:36:12,606 --> 00:36:14,466
but the fact is,
in the circumstances,

470
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:16,427
because
many of them appear attractive,

471
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:18,546
I do not see how I can
approach them individually.

472
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,050
So...

473
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:25,930
perhaps King Francis can assemble
seven or eight of them at Calais,

474
00:36:26,278 --> 00:36:29,166
I could go there and make their
acquaintance, all at the same time.

475
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:32,379
No, it... it is not
a french custom to send

476
00:36:32,504 --> 00:36:35,980
ladies of that rank, of such noble
and princely families to be

477
00:36:36,148 --> 00:36:39,609
be passed in review,
as if they were prize horses.

478
00:36:40,608 --> 00:36:43,553
Perhaps, if Your Majesty desires
one of these ladies,

479
00:36:43,678 --> 00:36:45,329
You could send an envoy,

480
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:48,902
to report on their manner and
appearance, in the traditional way.

481
00:36:49,027 --> 00:36:51,127
Well, I trust no one but myself.

482
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,716
The thing touches me too near.

483
00:36:54,454 --> 00:36:57,126
I want to see and know
them before deciding.

484
00:36:57,617 --> 00:37:00,796
Maybe Your Majesty would like
to mount them, one after another,

485
00:37:00,921 --> 00:37:04,391
and then pick the one
you find "best broken-in"?

486
00:37:08,491 --> 00:37:09,889
Monsieur Castillon,

487
00:37:11,043 --> 00:37:12,946
You have ten seconds
to get out of my court,

488
00:37:13,071 --> 00:37:15,061
or I will beat you like
the dog that you are!

489
00:37:29,057 --> 00:37:30,902
- Mr. Cromwell.
- Majesty.

490
00:37:32,103 --> 00:37:34,269
An incorrigible heretic
called John Lambert

491
00:37:34,394 --> 00:37:37,284
is now imprisoned in The Tower
and likely soon to be burned.

492
00:37:37,409 --> 00:37:39,287
I believe you know this man.

493
00:37:39,412 --> 00:37:42,579
I... KNEW him, many
years ago, at Cambridge.

494
00:37:43,477 --> 00:37:44,477
Not since?

495
00:37:45,665 --> 00:37:47,865
Not to my knowledge, Your Majesty.

496
00:37:48,805 --> 00:37:51,166
And whilst you were
at Cambridge, together,

497
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:53,541
did you share some of his opinions?

498
00:37:54,655 --> 00:37:56,255
Tell me, Mr. Cromwell,

499
00:37:57,469 --> 00:37:59,169
what do you believe NOW?

500
00:38:00,184 --> 00:38:03,834
As the world stands, Your Majesty,
I believe what YOU believe.

501
00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:07,655
So you think it right
that he SHOULD be burned?

502
00:38:08,451 --> 00:38:11,118
Yes, unless he recants.

503
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:13,309
Yes.

504
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:21,394
Oh, I forgot!

505
00:38:22,597 --> 00:38:25,247
- What were their names, again?
- Majesty?

506
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:27,800
The sisters of the Duke of Cleves.

507
00:38:28,546 --> 00:38:29,846
Amelia and Anne.

508
00:38:31,403 --> 00:38:32,703
Amelia and Anne.

509
00:38:37,062 --> 00:38:39,974
Send someone to take a look at them.
We'll have a second opinion.

510
00:38:40,914 --> 00:38:41,914
Majesty!

511
00:39:03,155 --> 00:39:05,355
Duke William will receive you now.

512
00:39:11,022 --> 00:39:12,222
Your Highness,

513
00:39:14,012 --> 00:39:15,462
the english envoys.

514
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:22,539
- Gentlemen!
- Your Highness.

515
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:27,369
So...

516
00:39:28,112 --> 00:39:30,917
His Majesty, King Henry, is alife,

517
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,230
and he is interested in my sisters.

518
00:39:35,428 --> 00:39:38,070
Yes, His Majesty has
been persuaded of their...

519
00:39:38,195 --> 00:39:41,619
aimiability and of their
suitability as royal consorts.

520
00:39:41,787 --> 00:39:44,001
Especially Anne, the eldest,

521
00:39:44,223 --> 00:39:47,173
who has been much praised
in the King's hearing.

522
00:39:48,037 --> 00:39:49,487
I am not surprised.

523
00:39:49,779 --> 00:39:53,388
His Majesty would also propose
the marriage of his daughter Mary

524
00:39:53,513 --> 00:39:57,168
to your eldest son,
a liaison with the Protestant League,

525
00:39:58,045 --> 00:40:01,866
and the recruitment of a hundred
seasoned cannoneers

526
00:40:01,991 --> 00:40:03,141
for His army.

527
00:40:04,323 --> 00:40:06,648
There is, then, gentlemen,
much to discuss.

528
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:07,930
Indeed...

529
00:40:08,143 --> 00:40:11,843
but first, we should like your
permission to meet your sisters.

530
00:40:13,129 --> 00:40:14,129
Why?

531
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:19,700
The King will expect us to report back
on what we have seen.

532
00:40:20,203 --> 00:40:22,853
To say that we have
NOT seen the ladies...

533
00:40:23,218 --> 00:40:25,168
would not exactly please him.

534
00:40:25,544 --> 00:40:28,307
He has also asked
for a portrait of Anne

535
00:40:28,432 --> 00:40:30,082
to be sent back to him.

536
00:40:32,636 --> 00:40:36,159
Unfortunately, My Court painter,
Mr. Cranack,

537
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,015
is... ill...

538
00:40:39,075 --> 00:40:40,140
and indisposed.

539
00:40:41,308 --> 00:40:45,123
In that case, we can
send over Mr. Holbein,

540
00:40:45,248 --> 00:40:47,335
who is an admirable artist.

541
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,344
- Indeed.
- Yes, perhaps...

542
00:40:51,626 --> 00:40:53,626
but you are going too quickly!

543
00:40:53,873 --> 00:40:56,615
What do you think my country is?
A meat market?

544
00:40:57,867 --> 00:41:01,567
I will arrange with my chancellor
for negotiations to commence.

545
00:41:01,788 --> 00:41:05,193
And you may have the opportunity,
at some stage,

546
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,310
of being presented to my sisters.

547
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:11,291
Your Highness, we...

548
00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:13,373
We will meet... again.

549
00:41:14,932 --> 00:41:16,432
Good day, gentlemen.

550
00:41:32,969 --> 00:41:33,969
John!

551
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,727
Thomas! How good to see you,

552
00:41:40,287 --> 00:41:42,869
and how excellently
you've done in the world.

553
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:47,351
I could wish our reunion
was in some better place.

554
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,345
I shall be quit of this place
soon enough.

555
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,684
On my way to a far better place.

556
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:04,558
John, you do not have to die.

557
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:06,936
All you have to say,
to satisfy the King,

558
00:42:07,061 --> 00:42:08,911
is that after Consecration,

559
00:42:09,195 --> 00:42:12,190
the wafer and the wine are truly
the body and the blood of Christ.

560
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,150
But you and I know they are not.

561
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:17,860
You don't have to believe it,
you just have to say it!

562
00:42:18,683 --> 00:42:19,833
Ah, Thomas...

563
00:42:20,565 --> 00:42:24,077
I see now what it takes for a man
to make his way in this world.

564
00:42:24,246 --> 00:42:27,122
He must make a practice
of hypocrisy.

565
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:31,520
There is no harm in indiscretion.

566
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:36,108
And, believe me, I want to spare you

567
00:42:36,233 --> 00:42:39,213
the awful pains
which have been prepared for you.

568
00:42:40,088 --> 00:42:43,238
Did Christ, himself,
not suffer awful pains, Thomas?

569
00:42:43,545 --> 00:42:46,962
We do not need martyrs,
we need living men,

570
00:42:47,629 --> 00:42:51,483
who will go on about quietly spreading
the business of our reformation.

571
00:42:52,148 --> 00:42:53,647
Who will believe a word I say,

572
00:42:53,772 --> 00:42:56,822
if I alter my opinion on
such a fundamental thing?

573
00:42:56,947 --> 00:42:59,525
John, I say to you, again,

574
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:03,862
while you still have a free choice,
will you live or die?

575
00:43:13,873 --> 00:43:15,473
My dear Lord Cromwell,

576
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:19,966
I see that all this while, we have not
been talking about me but about you.

577
00:43:20,311 --> 00:43:22,331
Not about my poor conscience,
but about yours.

578
00:43:22,456 --> 00:43:25,305
I see that you are afraid
of guilt by association,

579
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,150
and would rather I
purged my own soul.

580
00:43:29,484 --> 00:43:30,484
Alas...

581
00:43:31,597 --> 00:43:34,497
it is the only thing
in this world I have left.

582
00:43:38,853 --> 00:43:41,553
I am sorry you choose
not to save yourself.

583
00:43:45,693 --> 00:43:47,263
<i>Get back, you rabble!</i>

584
00:43:47,539 --> 00:43:49,739
<i>Get back, in the name of the King!</i>

585
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:06,043
<i>I'll pray for you!</i>

586
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:14,943
All for Christ!

587
00:44:15,816 --> 00:44:17,463
<i>All for Christ!</i>

588
00:44:52,102 --> 00:44:53,102
Majesty.

589
00:44:56,313 --> 00:44:58,810
Mr. Lambert has gone
to his execution.

590
00:44:59,584 --> 00:45:00,684
And to Hell!

591
00:45:09,016 --> 00:45:12,245
Princess Mary begs you to spare
the life of Lady Salisbury,

592
00:45:12,434 --> 00:45:14,984
Who, she says,
was like a mother to Her.

593
00:45:17,143 --> 00:45:19,505
She was also a mother
to Reginald Pole,

594
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:21,680
whom even heaven can't forgive.

595
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,278
Duke William says that...

596
00:45:29,053 --> 00:45:32,803
his painter is ill. He cannot
furnish images of his sister Anne.

597
00:45:34,618 --> 00:45:35,768
Send Holbein.

598
00:45:36,925 --> 00:45:38,475
I must see her image.

599
00:45:41,346 --> 00:45:42,463
Majesty.

600
00:45:42,957 --> 00:45:44,107
Mr. Cromwell.

601
00:46:12,182 --> 00:46:13,294
Gentlemen!

602
00:46:19,126 --> 00:46:22,561
You have my permission
to look upon my sisters.

603
00:46:35,964 --> 00:46:37,164
Your Highness!

604
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:42,680
We cannot even tell which
is Anne and which Amelia!

605
00:46:43,047 --> 00:46:45,175
Sirs, I am Anne.

606
00:46:45,715 --> 00:46:47,715
And I am Amelia, Your Honours.

607
00:46:48,977 --> 00:46:50,177
Your Highness,

608
00:46:51,002 --> 00:46:52,884
for our purposes...

609
00:46:53,782 --> 00:46:55,477
this is no good.

610
00:46:56,225 --> 00:46:58,558
No good? What?

611
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,811
Would you see them naked?

612
00:47:24,795 --> 00:47:26,895
Have you not been praying, Lady?

613
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,340
Your head is going
to be cut off now.

614
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,053
I don't want to die.

615
00:47:35,081 --> 00:47:36,952
I don't want to die.
No, please don't hurt me!

616
00:47:37,077 --> 00:47:38,958
No. Don't. Don't. Don't hurt me.

617
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:40,933
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die!

618
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:43,208
No! No, don't kill me! No!

619
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:45,621
Oh God, save me!
Oh God, help me!

620
00:47:45,746 --> 00:47:47,463
For God's sake, have some dignity.

621
00:47:47,588 --> 00:47:49,505
No, I don't want to die!

622
00:48:08,153 --> 00:48:09,853
- Eminence!
- My child.

623
00:48:10,482 --> 00:48:11,682
My poor child.

624
00:48:12,146 --> 00:48:13,496
He's killed them.

625
00:48:14,188 --> 00:48:16,378
My brother, my poor mother...

626
00:48:17,908 --> 00:48:21,669
The King of England is the most
cruel and abominable tyrant!

627
00:48:22,282 --> 00:48:25,521
Ah, there's no doubt, now,
he must be overthrown by force.

628
00:48:25,752 --> 00:48:27,458
Better that he should die,

629
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:30,733
than risk the Eternal Damnation
of all his subjects!

630
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,239
But there's nothing we can do.

631
00:48:33,364 --> 00:48:34,693
But we can!

632
00:48:35,116 --> 00:48:38,918
His Holiness is ready to promulgate
the Bull of Excommunication.

633
00:48:39,043 --> 00:48:41,140
The Emperor and the French
have made peace.

634
00:48:41,265 --> 00:48:43,663
They are now both willing to
point their swords at England.

635
00:48:43,903 --> 00:48:47,822
They will withdraw their ambassadors,
and prepare a fleet for invasion.

636
00:48:48,713 --> 00:48:50,813
And, the Holy Father expects you

637
00:48:51,069 --> 00:48:53,048
to return to The Netherlands
and to France,

638
00:48:53,461 --> 00:48:55,761
- to assist the preparations.
- No.

639
00:48:56,873 --> 00:49:00,443
No, please.
Let me help in other ways.

640
00:49:00,568 --> 00:49:02,474
What? Do... tell me,
are you frightened?

641
00:49:04,883 --> 00:49:08,651
Now, you should thank God that He
has called your family to Heaven.

642
00:49:08,776 --> 00:49:11,395
You should not weep.
So, what is belief?

643
00:49:12,261 --> 00:49:15,358
What is belief, if not
belief in the Will of God!

644
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,499
Do You think the Holy Father
wants you

645
00:49:17,624 --> 00:49:19,741
to go to The Netherlands
for his own sake?

646
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:22,369
Don't you think He has asked
God for guidance?

647
00:49:25,501 --> 00:49:26,551
Forgive me.

648
00:49:30,547 --> 00:49:31,697
Whe... Whe...

649
00:49:32,733 --> 00:49:35,342
When I was a young
priest in Germany,

650
00:49:35,983 --> 00:49:39,536
my family's house was occupied
by Lutheran mercenaries.

651
00:49:40,513 --> 00:49:43,636
I had a beautiful sister,
whom I loved

652
00:49:44,271 --> 00:49:46,871
more than anything else
in the world and,

653
00:49:47,842 --> 00:49:49,871
perhaps, even more than God.

654
00:49:50,752 --> 00:49:52,643
Well, they raped her,

655
00:49:53,186 --> 00:49:55,036
they cut off their breasts,

656
00:49:55,549 --> 00:49:58,286
they threw pieces
of her to their dogs,

657
00:49:59,661 --> 00:50:01,461
right in front of my eyes.

658
00:50:10,334 --> 00:50:11,434
All of us...

659
00:50:11,829 --> 00:50:14,229
have burdens to carry,
Cardinal Pole.

660
00:50:37,454 --> 00:50:39,204
Come on now, Master Paul.

661
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,549
There you are, Cardinal Pole.

662
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,740
Now,

663
00:51:52,775 --> 00:51:54,025
eat your heart!
