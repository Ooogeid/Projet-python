If I had known what I know now,
she would never have been brought here.

4
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,384
It is my duty to inform you
that Parliament

5
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:12,470
have found your marriage
to the King to be invalid.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,347
<i>Gentlemen and Ladies of the Court,</i>

7
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:16,850
I come here this day
to present to you my new wife,

8
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:18,375
Queen Katherine.

9
00:00:19,682 --> 00:00:21,438
I feel almost like a new man.

10
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,397
Should the man that woman
gives herself to, always be happy?

11
00:00:24,732 --> 00:00:26,567
Sex, Charles, is a great medicine.

12
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,321
I do not know who to say this to,
Mr. Culpepper.

13
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,552
I am not so used to everyone
looking at me.

14
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,119
My Lady, you must give men
leave to look...

15
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,069
There is no help for it.

16
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,874
My Lord Surrey,
how do you find the English Court?

17
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,418
I find it full of men of vile birth.

18
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,003
His family have royal blood.

19
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:48,435
Surely even you can see
the merits of dealing with him!

20
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:51,622
I invited you here
because I wanted to be friends.

21
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,678
What kind of friends?

22
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:55,096
Lady Mary,

23
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:58,957
it is my dearest wish that you and I
may be warm to each other.

24
00:00:59,124 --> 00:01:02,101
After all, you are
now my stepdaughter.

25
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:06,004
Your old friend is here,
Miss Joan Bulmer.

26
00:01:06,171 --> 00:01:08,318
Do you remember when
you-know-who used to come in?

27
00:01:08,714 --> 00:01:10,695
Late at night, and slip into bed?

28
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:14,514
For God's sake,
be careful what you say!

29
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:15,959
She's a little fireball.

30
00:01:16,126 --> 00:01:18,787
- Too hot for you, Mr. Culpepper.
- Really?

31
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:21,498
Just picture her naked body,
those breasts,

32
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:24,320
those thighs,
that sweet little arse.

33
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,961
All those things belong to the King.

Lady Rochford.

It seems to me she does
nothing but dance and rejoice!

40
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:35,715
She has every reason
to be happy, Mr. Culpepper.

41
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,465
The King spoils her.

42
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:40,397
Almost every day he buys her
new dresses or jewels.

43
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,219
It seems he cannot
treat her well enough!

44
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,299
I presume the King
is also very happy?

45
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,937
His Majesty seems like a new man.

46
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:52,649
He rises between 5 and 6 am,
attends Mass at 7,

47
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:55,574
rides out early to hunt,
comes back at 10 for dinner,

48
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:57,786
attends to business
in the afternoon.

49
00:03:57,953 --> 00:04:00,773
I think his new rule of living
is intended to keep him fit

50
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:02,500
if you understand me.

51
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:07,349
I suppose he would needs be fit,
if he wants to satisfy her.

52
00:04:08,968 --> 00:04:10,224
She is very...

53
00:04:11,142 --> 00:04:12,335
appealing.

54
00:04:15,395 --> 00:04:17,828
She's just a fool, Mr. Culpepper.

55
00:04:18,848 --> 00:04:21,458
A sweet... little fool!

56
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,309
How about you, Lady Rochford?

57
00:04:28,698 --> 00:04:31,122
It's been some time since
George Boleyn's death.

58
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:32,839
You've not remarried?

59
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:34,259
No.

60
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:55,573
The Duke of Suffolk, Your Majesty.

61
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,740
Charles,

62
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:00,529
I have something I want to show you.

63
00:05:00,895 --> 00:05:03,659

Tell me,

68
00:05:15,173 --> 00:05:16,604
how is Anne of Cleves?

69
00:05:17,872 --> 00:05:20,134
I believe she has settled
into her new estates,

70
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:22,488
and shows every sign
of being grateful

71
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,784
for Your Majesty's
charity and generosity.

72
00:05:25,153 --> 00:05:28,973
I also understand that she
has maintained her relationships

73
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,072
with Your Majesty's daughters

74
00:05:32,258 --> 00:05:34,431
and often asks them
to dine with her.

75
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,829
- Risley.
- Majesty.

76
00:05:38,996 --> 00:05:42,370
We shall write to the Lady Anne
to thank her for being so conformable,

77
00:05:42,537 --> 00:05:44,405
and to assure her
that if she continues,

78
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:46,564
she will find in us
a perfect friend,

79
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:49,656
content to repute her
as our dearest sister.

80
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,224
Majesty.

81
00:05:55,558 --> 00:05:58,032
Does the Duchess love
you any better, Charles?

82
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,449
She seems to...

83
00:06:00,123 --> 00:06:01,819
but only for the sake
of appearances.

84
00:06:09,748 --> 00:06:11,329
How can I help you Charles?

85
00:06:12,768 --> 00:06:15,824
Well, when she consents
to make love to me again...

86
00:06:16,472 --> 00:06:18,044
strike a medal to commemorate it!

87
00:06:33,942 --> 00:06:34,942
My Lady

88
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:36,720
My Lord Surrey.

89
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:38,940
I'd rather trusted to hear from you.

90
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:41,069
Why?

91
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,134
When we supped together,
you gave me to suppose that...

92
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,647
Mr. Culpepper.

93
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:49,339
Your Majesty.

94
00:06:56,687 --> 00:06:58,117
That I what, My Lord?

95
00:06:58,616 --> 00:07:00,197
That you would oblige me,

96
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:03,804
and accommodate my desire.

97
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,827
If I gave you that
impression I am truly sorry.

98
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:18,438
It was far from my intention.

99
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:20,674
Sleep with me.

100
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,614
Don't you know who I am?

101
00:07:30,468 --> 00:07:32,418
Of course I know who you are.

102
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:35,194
And you know who my husband is!

103
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,040
Yes I do!

104
00:07:37,786 --> 00:07:39,036
He's a Seymour.

105
00:07:41,298 --> 00:07:43,006
His family are wolves.

106
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:46,637
Mine are lions!

107
00:07:49,507 --> 00:07:50,657
Forgive me...

108
00:07:51,256 --> 00:07:52,845
for aiming so low!

109
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,232
My Lord, His Majesty
wants to see you.

110
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:10,167
The Earl of Hertford, Your majesty.

111
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:17,554
I wish I could go
dancing like all of you!

112
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,166
Whenever I hear the music,

113
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,499
I feel like nobody has
a care in the world!

114
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:27,048
Look at my cares!

115
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:31,636
I had someone once
who could take care of all of this!

116
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,019
But now he's gone!

117
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:36,121
How is my son?

118
00:08:36,655 --> 00:08:39,580
Prince Edward is very well.
He is a strong and healthy boy.

119
00:08:39,747 --> 00:08:41,646
- He does his father proud.
- Thank God.

120
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,770
I trust he will soon be followed
by other princes.

121
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,681
I'm making you a new appointment.

122
00:08:54,474 --> 00:08:56,994
I'm making you
Lieutenant General to the North.

123
00:08:57,816 --> 00:09:00,139
There's been too many incursions
over the border

124
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,812
from Scotland into England.

125
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:04,720
I want you to deal with my cousin,
the King of the Scots,

126
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:06,583
and I want these incursions stopped.

127
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,595
If he does not stop them,

128
00:09:08,972 --> 00:09:11,001
you have our express
permission to harry

129
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:13,574
and persecute the people
on his side of the border

130
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:16,889
with as much aggression
and as much force as you see fit.

131
00:09:17,304 --> 00:09:18,464
I understand.

132
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:25,329
We might, in time, meet
our cousin, King James.

133
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,445
For all we know, he may not be
as stupid as he appears. But for now,

134
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:33,437
I am trusting you to ensure
that the Scots cease their...

135
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:38,597
impertinence.

136
00:09:42,326 --> 00:09:43,326
Katherine!

137
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:45,711
God!

138
00:09:46,738 --> 00:09:47,746
Fuck me!

139
00:09:49,582 --> 00:09:50,582
Fuck me...

140
00:09:53,056 --> 00:09:55,480
- Katherine!
- Oh yes... oh yes...

141
00:09:56,651 --> 00:09:57,651
God...

142
00:09:58,228 --> 00:09:59,478
Just fuck me...

143
00:10:14,984 --> 00:10:16,484
Go on! Tell me more!

144
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:19,558
I promised her I wouldn't.

145
00:10:20,793 --> 00:10:21,943
Dearest Joan,

146
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,758
you can tell me.

147
00:10:23,925 --> 00:10:26,353
I'm responsible for everything
to do with the Queen.

148
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,258
So, I have to know everything.

149
00:10:28,822 --> 00:10:30,379
That way, I can protect her.

150
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:35,263
So, when you both lived at Lambeth,

151
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,416
under the protection of the Duchess,

152
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,384
what exactly happened?

153
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,799
There were these two Gallants.

154
00:10:44,546 --> 00:10:46,883
They were called Frances Dereham

155
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:49,480
and Edward Waldegrave,

156
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:52,652
who was a Gentleman
in waiting upon the Duchess.

157
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:55,143
Anyway,

158
00:10:55,859 --> 00:10:59,105
they found a way to call,
secretly, at night,

159
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,152
upon Katherine and me.

160
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:05,006
And they would lie
in our beds all night.

161
00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:08,297
You with Waldegrave

162
00:11:08,864 --> 00:11:10,995
and Katherine
with this Francis Dereham?

163
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:13,161
Yes. That's how it was.

164
00:11:14,145 --> 00:11:16,175
And what would these gentlemen
do to you?

165
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:27,736
Didn't anyone say anything?
Didn't they find out?

166
00:11:28,843 --> 00:11:29,843
Well,

167
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,860
if Dereham used her
as a man doth his wife,

168
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:36,786
it was only because she thought
herself already betrothed to him.

169
00:11:37,174 --> 00:11:38,531
Like on a promise.

170
00:11:39,018 --> 00:11:41,861
It went on between them a long time.

171
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:53,683
Still, you won't tell anyone,
will you?

172
00:11:54,749 --> 00:11:56,173
You won't say anything?

173
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,861
She made me swear!

174
00:12:01,677 --> 00:12:04,110
No. I won't say anything.

175
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,389
<i>Good morning!
It's a lovely day today!</i>

176
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:11,728
<i>Come on! Get out of my way!</i>

177
00:12:12,548 --> 00:12:14,178
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

178
00:12:18,753 --> 00:12:19,753
<i>Wait!</i>

179
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,826
<i>Clear out of here, you fucking slut!</i>

180
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,669
Hey! What in God's name
are you doing?!

181
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,877
Starin' at a real woman, are you?

182
00:12:31,224 --> 00:12:32,973
What are you looking at? Eh?

183
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:40,080
Good sport my Lord, good sport!

184
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Fuck of!

185
00:12:46,945 --> 00:12:50,580
The Earl of Surrey has been jailed
for public disorder, Your Majesty.

186
00:12:52,353 --> 00:12:54,479
The Earl maintained
he was the scourge of God?

187
00:12:54,646 --> 00:12:55,733
Yes, Your Majesty.

188
00:12:57,571 --> 00:13:00,059
And called London itself
"a shameless whore"?

189
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:01,876
Yes. He did indeed so.

190
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,581
What about eating meat during Lent?

191
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,448
He told us he had
a license to do so. But...

192
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:15,599
But what?

193
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:19,651
Bishop Gardiner suspects
my Lord Surrey

194
00:13:19,818 --> 00:13:23,067
of obtaining his meat on the black
market from some evangelical butchers

195
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:25,811
in Honey Lane,
near the church of All Hallows.

196
00:13:26,156 --> 00:13:29,084
This same church, Your Majesty,
is suspected by some

197
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:32,717
of secretly sowing and setting forth
Lutheran heresies,

198
00:13:33,232 --> 00:13:35,788
and of deliberately
flouting the fasting laws.

199
00:13:37,537 --> 00:13:39,782
I never thought Surrey
could be a heretic.

200
00:13:40,643 --> 00:13:42,838
His father is closer to a Papist...

201
00:13:43,144 --> 00:13:45,413
although to my face,
he pretends otherwise!

202
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:49,674
His Grace and I would be inclined,
with Your Majesty's permission, to...

203
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,668
examine the Earl more closely
on these fundamental matters.

204
00:13:57,394 --> 00:13:58,796
You want to torture him?

205
00:14:12,888 --> 00:14:13,888
No.

206
00:14:14,473 --> 00:14:16,147
Release him... for now.

207
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:21,003
Majesty.

208
00:14:26,273 --> 00:14:28,300
We should make plans
for the New Year.

209
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:29,946
Yes, Your Majesty.

210
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:33,739
I would like to invite
the Lady Mary to court.

211
00:14:35,913 --> 00:14:37,878
I'd also like to
invite Anne of Cleves

212
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,661
for New Year's celebrations.

213
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,039
My Lady, here are your
presents from the King.

214
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:05,016
Presents!

215
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:09,737
So beautiful!

216
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
Look!

217
00:15:12,753 --> 00:15:14,353
So shiny! Smell!

218
00:15:17,473 --> 00:15:18,936
Smells of roses! It's lovely.

219
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,830
It's perfect!

220
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:30,426
My Lady! Look!

221
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:33,609
Oh my goodness!

222
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,806
His Majesty spoils you!

223
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:40,066
I know he does!

224
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:43,165
But am I not worth it?

225
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:46,974
Feel it, it's so soft.

226
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:52,510
I am the Queen of England.

227
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,754
Oh gold!

228
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:56,330
I love gold!

229
00:16:00,131 --> 00:16:01,575
It goes with my dress.

230
00:16:03,977 --> 00:16:07,210
- Happy Christmas, Ladies.
- Happy Christmas, Your Majesty.

231
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,625
- Where are we going?
- There are more presents.

232
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:12,650
More?

233
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:22,797
What do you think?

234
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,125
They're beautiful.

235
00:16:26,858 --> 00:16:29,242
They were sent ahead by
Anne of Cleves as a gift.

236
00:16:29,545 --> 00:16:30,825
She arrives tomorrow.

237
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:32,975
Anne of Cleves?

238
00:16:33,808 --> 00:16:36,159
Yes. I've invited her for New Year.

239
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:38,340
You don't mind, do you?

240
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,050
No, of course I don't mind.

241
00:16:41,327 --> 00:16:43,460
Your Majesty must do as you will.

242
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:52,306
But...

243
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,430
will I like her,

244
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,257
this Anne of Cleves?

245
00:16:57,441 --> 00:16:58,427
Wait and see.

246
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,300
Stay quiet.

247
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,545
I hope the Lady Mary will be
more gracious than before.

248
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:14,371
<i>My Lords, Lady Mary.</i>

249
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:35,199
Your Majesty.

250
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,598
My beautiful daughter.

251
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,731
Say hello to the Queen.

252
00:17:49,023 --> 00:17:49,943
Madam.

253
00:17:50,473 --> 00:17:53,405
Lady Mary. I am very glad
to see you back at court.

254
00:17:54,969 --> 00:17:58,577
Thank you for my gifts. Your Majesty,
as always, is more than generous.

255
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:00,376
Charles.

256
00:18:35,651 --> 00:18:36,651
Lady Anne.

257
00:18:37,195 --> 00:18:38,242
Your Grace.

258
00:18:44,995 --> 00:18:47,594
I remember that you once
taught me to play cards.

259
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,442
I am very grateful.

260
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,713
As a result of your tuition,
I have won a fortune!

261
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,055
My Lords,

262
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:02,345
Lady Anne of Cleves!

263
00:19:20,822 --> 00:19:21,822
Lady Anne.

264
00:19:24,178 --> 00:19:25,456
Welcome to my court.

265
00:19:27,114 --> 00:19:28,072
Your Majesty!

266
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:29,999
Happy Christmas.

267
00:19:30,825 --> 00:19:33,464
Allow me to introduce
to you my new wife.

268
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,659
Your Majesty.

269
00:19:38,255 --> 00:19:39,584
What a great privilege

270
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:42,651
and honour it is for me
to be presented to you.

271
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:44,883
I am so delighted.

272
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:48,194
You are very welcome to court,
Lady Anne.

273
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:52,032
We thank you so much for the
two fine horses you sent,

274
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:54,818
and wish you a very happy New Year.

275
00:19:55,206 --> 00:19:56,798
Thank you, Your Majesty.

276
00:19:57,513 --> 00:19:59,990
I think we should all be merry!

277
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,058
Yes!

278
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:17,966
Ladies. Excellency.

279
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,553
You are not well?

280
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:25,292
These days I suffer a
little from gout, Lady Mary.

281
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,898
- Please sit.
- Thank you.

282
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,692
You are and always have been...

283
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:39,626
my most faithful...

284
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,783
and truest friend in all this world.

285
00:20:46,235 --> 00:20:48,413
I could not bear it if you
were ever to leave here.

286
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:59,481
He ought not to have
divorced the Lady Anne.

287
00:20:59,796 --> 00:21:01,187
Now that I know her better,

288
00:21:01,354 --> 00:21:03,688
I think she is perfectly
sweet and gracious.

289
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,625
Nevertheless, Lady Mary,

290
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:09,206
I fear that you will have to
reconcile yourself to the new Queen.

291
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,020
No, I will not. I hate her.

292
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:15,602
Then, perhaps,

293
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:18,769
after all, you do not require
my advice any more.

294
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:40,584
My Lady, I wanted to ask if you
had any news of my brother Edward?

295
00:21:40,751 --> 00:21:43,766
He's well enough. Cold, but well.

296
00:21:44,781 --> 00:21:46,354
Wet, but well.

297
00:21:47,564 --> 00:21:50,926
Apparently, it always rains
in the north, and the mud is free.

298
00:21:51,205 --> 00:21:52,595
Will he see some action?

299
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:56,061
I believe he intends to punish
the Scots for their wickedness.

300
00:21:56,553 --> 00:21:58,434
That sounds very like my brother.

301
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:01,735
If only you could be more
like him, Sir Thomas.

302
00:22:02,257 --> 00:22:03,392
What do you mean?

303
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:07,561
My husband always
takes what he wants.

304
00:22:17,506 --> 00:22:18,921
Ladies, you must forgive me.

305
00:22:19,603 --> 00:22:22,331
I rode out early to hunt
this morning, I am very tired.

306
00:22:22,989 --> 00:22:24,936
We shall dine again
together tomorrow evening.

307
00:22:25,103 --> 00:22:26,637
- Lady Anne.
- Your Majesty.

308
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,287
My beautiful wife.

309
00:22:29,554 --> 00:22:32,590
Now, I must insist
you stay to enjoy the dancing.

310
00:22:34,423 --> 00:22:35,228
Boy.

311
00:22:36,405 --> 00:22:37,210
Boy!

312
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,931
I bid you all a good night.
Happy New Year!

313
00:22:51,098 --> 00:22:53,098
Happy New Year, Your Majesty!

314
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:06,510
I wonder... Will you have
some more wine, Lady Anne?

315
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:09,680
With pleasure, if Your Majesty will.

316
00:23:10,252 --> 00:23:11,046
Yes.

317
00:23:11,668 --> 00:23:12,366
Wine.

318
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,575
- Your Majesty.
- Thank you!

319
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,701
Lady Anne.

320
00:23:26,813 --> 00:23:28,703
His Majesty tells me that

321
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:32,154
his daughter, the Lady Elizabeth,
sometimes comes to see you.

322
00:23:36,427 --> 00:23:37,698
How do you find her?

323
00:23:38,326 --> 00:23:40,277
Oh, she is charming.

324
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,849
So clever. And so beautiful.

325
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,896
And so very affectionate.

326
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,686
It is always a pleasure to see her.

327
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,438
You see,

328
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:55,957
I have no desire to remarry,

329
00:23:56,949 --> 00:24:00,147
so I am sure I will never
have any children of my own.

330
00:24:00,694 --> 00:24:04,301
I think a little that Elizabeth
is like a daughter to me.

331
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:06,987
Surely it is so:

332
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,767
To have had her as a daughter
would have been

333
00:24:09,934 --> 00:24:13,345
a greater happiness to
me than ever being Queen.

334
00:24:29,657 --> 00:24:30,624
Jesus Christ!

335
00:24:53,891 --> 00:24:54,875
That's better.

336
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:12,837
May I ask Your Majesty a question?

337
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:15,011
Go on.

338
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,785
Why did Your Majesty invite Lady
Anne of Cleves for Christmas?

339
00:25:27,711 --> 00:25:29,213
I like her, after all.

340
00:25:29,954 --> 00:25:31,712
She keeps her promises, boy.

341
00:25:55,484 --> 00:25:57,016
Majesty? Come!

342
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:13,356
So...

343
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:16,850
What did this Joan Bulmer tell you?

344
00:27:20,835 --> 00:27:23,416
She said that...

345
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:28,184
on the nights Dereham
visited Katherine's bed,

346
00:27:29,571 --> 00:27:32,504
he would bring with him wine,

347
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,568
strawberries, and apples,

348
00:27:36,228 --> 00:27:37,228
and...

349
00:27:38,096 --> 00:27:40,899
other things to make good cheer.

350
00:27:43,063 --> 00:27:44,203
And then?

351
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:48,539
Then...

352
00:28:02,209 --> 00:28:03,106
What then?

353
00:28:08,162 --> 00:28:09,666
There would be kissing

354
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:10,833
and...

355
00:28:12,611 --> 00:28:14,818
he would pull down his hose
and lie down with her.

356
00:28:17,403 --> 00:28:18,755
And the two of them would

357
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,959
hang by their bellies
like two sparrows.

358
00:28:37,232 --> 00:28:38,466
Come here.

359
00:28:42,342 --> 00:28:46,292
"And the two of them would hang by
their bellies like two sparrows."

360
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,020
Why are you here?

361
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,737
Taking what I want.

362
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:11,512
Just like my brother does.

363
00:29:12,699 --> 00:29:14,222
Just like he's always done.

364
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,057
And what if I don't want it?

365
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:24,449
What if I call my servants?

366
00:29:25,786 --> 00:29:26,668
You won't.

367
00:29:27,384 --> 00:29:28,540
And you know why?

368
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,863
Because you hate my brother.

369
00:29:33,469 --> 00:29:34,569
You hate him

370
00:29:35,467 --> 00:29:37,149
almost as much as I hate him

371
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,834
but you can't tell anyone

372
00:29:40,749 --> 00:29:41,749
except me.

373
00:30:27,052 --> 00:30:28,052
Well,

374
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,920
Mr. Seymour,

375
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,680
come into my bed.

376
00:30:43,479 --> 00:30:45,529
Enjoy what your brother enjoys.

377
00:30:46,796 --> 00:30:49,139
It will be interesting
to compare you.

378
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,644
<i>Credo in unum Deum
patris omnipotentum.</i>

379
00:30:58,685 --> 00:31:01,495
<i>Credo in unum Deum patris</i>

380
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:03,973
<i>Patris omnipotentum.</i>

381
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,047
My Lady! My Lady!
The Queen is here!

382
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:26,953
Majesty.

383
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,972
Lady Mary, I have come here
in person to ask you

384
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:34,392
why you will not show me the respect
which, as Queen of England,

385
00:31:34,863 --> 00:31:37,353
I am entitled to expect,
even from you.

386
00:31:38,716 --> 00:31:40,552
I noticed, as did everyone else,

387
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:43,177
that you show
the greatest respect to the Lady Anne,

388
00:31:43,344 --> 00:31:45,945
even though she is a private person
and worth no account.

389
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:49,218
Forgive me.
But surely the Lady Anne is

390
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:50,992
worthy of every respect?

391
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,886
She carries herself
with great dignity

392
00:31:54,053 --> 00:31:55,403
and also modesty,

393
00:31:56,177 --> 00:31:59,519
and desires nothing more than
to please the King, her Lord.

394
00:31:59,988 --> 00:32:01,973
Do you mean
I do not try to please him?

395
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,797
I think you desire almost
nothing else than pleasure!

396
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:08,758
It pleases you, it seems, to do nothing
but wear pretty clothes and dance.

397
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:11,586
Some people may think that frivolous

398
00:32:11,753 --> 00:32:14,953
in the consort of a King,
whose flesh is also sacred.

399
00:32:15,694 --> 00:32:19,344
If his Majesty thought me
only frivolous, why did he marry me?

400
00:32:21,222 --> 00:32:22,507
You are thought

401
00:32:23,204 --> 00:32:24,904
capable of bearing sons.

402
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:28,238
Unfortunately,
for all the King's attentions,

403
00:32:28,768 --> 00:32:30,949
I see you are still not pregnant.

404
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:34,786
In any case,
he will soon tire of you.

405
00:32:35,462 --> 00:32:36,371
You'll see.

406
00:32:40,205 --> 00:32:41,655
And what about you?

407
00:32:45,973 --> 00:32:47,574
And what about me?

408
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:49,968
I think you're jealous.

409
00:32:50,364 --> 00:32:52,554
You're jealous because
you're older than me

410
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,754
and you're still not married.

411
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:00,420
Perhaps you'll never be married,
and will grow old a maid!

412
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:07,634
How dare you speak to me like that.

413
00:33:08,925 --> 00:33:10,850
I dare because I can.

414
00:33:14,116 --> 00:33:16,266
And I can do something else, too.

415
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:21,135
As punishment for your lack of respect
towards his Majesty's wife,

416
00:33:21,687 --> 00:33:24,167
I am removing two of your maids
from your service.

417
00:33:24,334 --> 00:33:25,918
A good day to you, Lady Mary.

418
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:48,617
Here's to love.

419
00:33:50,308 --> 00:33:51,321
To Katherine,

420
00:33:51,775 --> 00:33:52,989
Queen of England.

421
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:56,068
And, God willing, may you
soon be ripe with children.

422
00:33:57,139 --> 00:33:58,139
Thank you.

423
00:33:58,928 --> 00:34:00,028
Both of you.

424
00:34:01,285 --> 00:34:02,999
You are so kind, Lady Anne

425
00:34:04,138 --> 00:34:05,986
and my gracious Lord.

426
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,002
I am the most happy

427
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:14,708
I have ever been in my whole life.

428
00:34:17,864 --> 00:34:19,038
I have a gift for you.

429
00:34:28,152 --> 00:34:29,442
Oh my God!

430
00:34:32,074 --> 00:34:33,946
May I please see it, Your Majesty?

431
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,422
Oh, what's this?
Not more presents!

432
00:34:41,925 --> 00:34:43,078
Do you like them?

433
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:45,497
Oh, I just adore them.

434
00:34:45,664 --> 00:34:46,876
They're so pretty.

435
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:54,327
But...

436
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:55,575
But?

437
00:34:56,588 --> 00:34:59,913
With Your Majesty's permission,
I would like to share these gifts

438
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,684
- with the Lady Anne.
- With me?

439
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:04,673
Oh No!

440
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,063
May I?

441
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,094
Of course.

442
00:35:11,221 --> 00:35:12,360
Thank you!

443
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:14,417
So sweet!

444
00:35:14,827 --> 00:35:15,940
They're yours.

445
00:35:16,997 --> 00:35:19,818
- Thank you, Katherine!
- Happy New Year, Lady Anne,

446
00:35:23,724 --> 00:35:24,555
Hello!

447
00:35:25,755 --> 00:35:26,626
Hello.

448
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:28,791
Isn't he sweet?

449
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:42,511
Lady Mary!
What are you doing?

450
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:44,651
I'm going back to Hunsdon.

451
00:35:44,818 --> 00:35:46,644
You asked his Majesty's permission?

452
00:35:48,093 --> 00:35:49,593
Why are you leaving?

453
00:35:50,089 --> 00:35:51,315
Haven't you heard?

454
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,582
She has removed two of my maids!

455
00:35:54,912 --> 00:35:55,796
The Queen?

456
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:59,308
Apparently I don't treat her
with sufficient respect.

457
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,712
Madam, please.
I am sure if you found some

458
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,041
small means to conciliate the Queen,

459
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:06,957
then the maids would remain...

460
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:08,750
No! Why should I?

461
00:36:09,642 --> 00:36:11,502
I don't want to conciliate her.

462
00:36:31,337 --> 00:36:32,732
What did she say to you?

463
00:36:34,577 --> 00:36:35,571
She said...

464
00:36:37,135 --> 00:36:38,835
that I'm jealous of her.

465
00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:42,121
Because she...

466
00:36:43,527 --> 00:36:44,547
is married

467
00:36:46,785 --> 00:36:47,885
and I'm not.

468
00:36:56,205 --> 00:36:57,384
And may never be.

469
00:37:00,143 --> 00:37:01,936
She ought not to have said
such things.

470
00:37:02,103 --> 00:37:03,103
No, but...

471
00:37:05,028 --> 00:37:06,178
they're true!

472
00:37:08,515 --> 00:37:09,501
They're true!

473
00:37:34,198 --> 00:37:35,204
My sweet Lady.

474
00:37:37,913 --> 00:37:39,568
My poor sweet Lady.

475
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:53,908
Lady Rochford.

476
00:38:02,471 --> 00:38:04,407
How is the King today,
Mr. Culpepper?

477
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:08,106
He is very well, your Majesty.
He sends you his love

478
00:38:08,273 --> 00:38:10,772
and hopes you are
well looked after and entertained.

479
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,442
I wanted to go riding today
but the weather was too bad.

480
00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:15,920
I'm sorry to hear it.

481
00:38:22,816 --> 00:38:24,861
His Majesty wants you to know

482
00:38:25,028 --> 00:38:28,358
that the military campaign against
the Scots has been a great success,

483
00:38:28,665 --> 00:38:30,869
and he is most pleased
with Lord Hertford

484
00:38:31,036 --> 00:38:33,436
and his other Captains,
who performed well in the field.

485
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,207
Which field?

486
00:38:36,811 --> 00:38:38,237
It means the battlefield.

487
00:38:40,627 --> 00:38:41,647
I'm glad.

488
00:38:42,228 --> 00:38:43,043
Glad?

489
00:38:43,652 --> 00:38:45,043
That they did so well.

490
00:38:45,816 --> 00:38:47,283
In the field.

491
00:38:52,722 --> 00:38:54,206
Is there anything else,

492
00:38:55,095 --> 00:38:56,295
Mr. Culpepper?

493
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:03,424
Yes, yes. This book.

494
00:39:06,108 --> 00:39:07,907
It was written by Richard Jonas,

495
00:39:08,074 --> 00:39:09,718
who came with Anne of Cleves,

496
00:39:09,885 --> 00:39:11,828
and meant to dedicate it
to his mistress.

497
00:39:11,995 --> 00:39:15,916
But now, with Your Majesty's permission,
he would like to dedicate it to you.

498
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:17,733
What is it? Give it me.

499
00:39:20,729 --> 00:39:22,512
"The Byrthe..."

500
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:24,927
"of Mankind"?

501
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:29,175
I believe it's the first major work
on midwifery to be written in English.

502
00:39:29,342 --> 00:39:30,342
Midwifery?

503
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:47,846
Mr. Jonas would now like to
dedicate it to the most gracious

504
00:39:48,624 --> 00:39:52,147
and in all goodness,
most excellent, virtuous lady,

505
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,458
I wonder what it would feel like?

506
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:33,667
What what would feel like?

507
00:40:34,677 --> 00:40:36,469
I should go down to her with wine,

508
00:40:36,636 --> 00:40:39,395
apples, and strawberries,
although they are all out of season.

509
00:40:40,406 --> 00:40:41,915
Who are you talking about?

510
00:40:44,297 --> 00:40:46,112
Who do you think I'm talking about?

511
00:40:48,463 --> 00:40:51,072
Hanging by their bellies
like two sparrows!

512
00:41:07,252 --> 00:41:09,425
- Do you really want to?
- What?

513
00:41:15,263 --> 00:41:16,263
If you do,

514
00:41:19,425 --> 00:41:20,931
I could arrange it.

515
00:41:46,445 --> 00:41:47,445
My Lord.

516
00:41:53,768 --> 00:41:55,899
- Thank God, your Grace!
- What's happened?

517
00:41:56,066 --> 00:41:56,872
Come!

518
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,040
How bad is it?

519
00:42:01,381 --> 00:42:03,425
Your Grace,
the ulcer on his Majesty's leg

520
00:42:03,592 --> 00:42:05,273
has become clogged again.

521
00:42:05,701 --> 00:42:09,359
We have no option but to drain off
the fluid which has collected there.

522
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:12,276
Otherwise...
We fear for His Majesty's life!

523
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,665
Forgive me, Majesty...

524
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:48,330
This is worse than ever before,
Your Grace.

525
00:42:48,497 --> 00:42:50,472
What happens if the King should die?

526
00:42:51,287 --> 00:42:54,237
Your Grace must pray to
heaven that he does not.

527
00:42:54,657 --> 00:42:56,363
But he looks likely to die!

528
00:42:56,878 --> 00:42:58,653
That is what I'm afraid of.

529
00:43:34,595 --> 00:43:35,595
My Lords,

530
00:43:36,568 --> 00:43:38,938
I assure you that I am not content.

531
00:43:41,158 --> 00:43:42,758
I have relied upon you

532
00:43:43,984 --> 00:43:45,684
to inform and counsel me

533
00:43:47,471 --> 00:43:49,521
and yet I am the most deceived.

534
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:52,239
I have trusted

535
00:43:52,629 --> 00:43:54,152
and favored all of you.

536
00:43:57,252 --> 00:43:58,402
I have formed

537
00:43:59,245 --> 00:44:00,755
a sinister opinion...

538
00:44:02,963 --> 00:44:04,763
that most of you are liars

539
00:44:05,805 --> 00:44:07,005
and flatterers

540
00:44:08,344 --> 00:44:10,397
who look only to your own profits.

541
00:44:11,324 --> 00:44:12,794
I know what you are plotting.

542
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,650
And if God gives me the strength,

543
00:44:18,008 --> 00:44:19,968
I will see to it that none

544
00:44:20,629 --> 00:44:24,078
of your projects ever succeed!

545
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:28,499
I mourn Cromwell's death.

546
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:30,298
Yes!

547
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:32,394
I mourn him.

548
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:34,985
I mourn him now

549
00:44:35,152 --> 00:44:37,512
that I perceive my Councilors,

550
00:44:38,304 --> 00:44:39,660
by light pretext,

551
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:41,966
and by false accusations,

552
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,839
made me put to death the most

553
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,259
faithful servant I ever had.

554
00:45:01,093 --> 00:45:02,093
Culpepper.

555
00:45:20,241 --> 00:45:22,511
Your Majesty, Mr. Culpepper is here.

556
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,737
Thank God! May I see His Majesty?

557
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:28,654
Forgive me, my Lady,
but his Majesty remains indisposed.

558
00:45:29,122 --> 00:45:30,477
He sends you his love

559
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,021
and this as a token of it.

560
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:35,104
I thank His Majesty, but...

561
00:45:35,908 --> 00:45:39,408
It is ten days since I have
been allowed into his presence.

562
00:45:39,614 --> 00:45:43,286
Why will he not see me? Why?
Have I offended him in some way?

563
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,075
What have I done?

564
00:45:46,026 --> 00:45:50,019
He cannot love me so much
if he can so easily neglect me!

565
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,792
Perhaps he has taken a mistress!

566
00:45:56,962 --> 00:46:00,674
Has he taken a mistress?
Is that why he won't see me?

567
00:46:02,501 --> 00:46:04,553
I cannot answer your Majesty.
I'm sorry.

568
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:08,640
Is he with his mistress now?

569
00:46:14,244 --> 00:46:17,169
Very well. You may go,
since you will not tell me anything,

570
00:46:17,431 --> 00:46:20,531
even though you see how
unhappy and miserable I am!

571
00:46:23,151 --> 00:46:25,350
You know I would do
anything in the world,

572
00:46:26,638 --> 00:46:27,565
anything...

573
00:46:28,198 --> 00:46:30,493
To bring you comfort
and make you happy.

574
00:46:31,947 --> 00:46:34,381
More than any other woman,
you deserve to be happy.

575
00:47:21,263 --> 00:47:23,424
Mr. Culpepper is so handsome.

576
00:47:28,177 --> 00:47:29,652
He's in love with you.

577
00:47:34,096 --> 00:47:35,060
In love?

578
00:47:36,576 --> 00:47:37,416
Yes.

579
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,898
He has confessed everything.

580
00:47:40,475 --> 00:47:41,693
He loves you madly.

581
00:47:41,998 --> 00:47:43,735
He told me so. He said

582
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:46,182
he would happily die for you!

583
00:47:47,154 --> 00:47:49,366
And that he thinks and dreams of you

584
00:47:49,873 --> 00:47:51,073
day and night.

585
00:48:19,322 --> 00:48:20,973
Surrey wrote a poem about us,

586
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,507
- which is circulating the court.
- About us?

587
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,494
What does he say?

588
00:48:28,162 --> 00:48:29,923
He calls you the wolf lady.

589
00:48:30,213 --> 00:48:31,815
Naturally, he is the lion.

590
00:48:32,417 --> 00:48:33,931
He says you tried to entrap him

591
00:48:34,098 --> 00:48:37,589
but he is too noble a beast to
be tangled by such cunning hooks!

592
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,334
He also warns you
that if you should cross

593
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,542
his path again, he will feed on you as
you meant to feed on him.

594
00:48:46,988 --> 00:48:50,344
He says that we rose high
by murdering the innocent!

595
00:49:55,478 --> 00:49:57,696
<i>You know I'd do
anything in the world,</i>

596
00:50:00,482 --> 00:50:01,369
<i>anything...</i>

597
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:04,442
<i>to bring you comfort
and make you happy.</i>

598
00:50:08,287 --> 00:50:10,632
<i>More than any other woman,
you deserve to be happy.</i>

599
00:50:43,893 --> 00:50:45,421
He wants to visit you.

600
00:50:46,345 --> 00:50:47,286
Privately.

601
00:50:48,155 --> 00:50:48,960
Who?

602
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:53,079
Culpepper.

603
00:50:56,138 --> 00:50:57,053
He can't!

604
00:50:57,783 --> 00:50:58,936
That's not possible.

605
00:51:00,124 --> 00:51:01,474
Of course he can!

606
00:51:02,917 --> 00:51:04,374
Just like that other one...

607
00:51:04,665 --> 00:51:06,043
coming to you at night.

608
00:51:09,521 --> 00:51:11,021
You know about that?

609
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:12,944
Of course.

610
00:51:13,972 --> 00:51:15,472
Joan Bulmer told me.

611
00:51:17,341 --> 00:51:19,063
And it can be just the same.

612
00:51:20,071 --> 00:51:21,071
A secret.

613
00:51:22,381 --> 00:51:24,081
Nobody else need ever know...

614
00:51:26,015 --> 00:51:27,040
not the King,

615
00:51:29,881 --> 00:51:30,981
not anybody!

616
00:51:48,337 --> 00:51:49,371
Are you sure?

617
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:10,988
Come!

618
00:52:12,193 --> 00:52:13,011
Come!
