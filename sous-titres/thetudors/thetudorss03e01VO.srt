00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,800
- Jane.
- Your majesty.

6
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,800
We are come here together

7
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:54,800
Before god and these witnesses
To join in holy matrimony henry viii,

8
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
King of england and france,

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,500
Defender of the faith, Supreme
head of the church of england,

10
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,100
And the lady jane seymour.

11
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,300
And if there be any among you
Who may imagine some impediments

12
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,300
As to why they should not be married,

13
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,100
Let them now speak out,
Or forever hold their tongue.

14
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Thank you for my gift,
it's so very beautiful.

15
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,900
I soon trust to thank you for mine.

16
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:43,100
Shall we join in the dance.

17
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,000
Music.

18
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,000
- I feel guilty.
- Why.

19
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,900
Because sometimes i forget
about how beautiful you are.

20
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,900
I think she'll make him happy.

21
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,200
God's help, we'll all be happy now.

22
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,400
I don't recognize you, my lady.

23
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,800
- Are you new at court?
- Yes, sir.

24
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,300
I am to be a maid to her majesty.

25
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,400
What's your name?

26
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,800
Lady ursula misseldon.

27
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,500
You know who i am?

28
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,800
You're sir francis bryan.
I've heard about you.

29
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,700
What have you heard?

30
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,000
You like to board other man's boats.

31
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,400
I trust that i shall be seeing
A lot more of you, lady misseldon.

32
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,600
Since both the king's daughters Have
been declared illegimate and unfit to rule,

33
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,300
We must trust the queen
to conceive a child quickly.

34
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,500
I still fear, with anne's death,

35
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,300
We've lost a great friend
and a powerful supporter.

36
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,300
If the new queen favors
the catholic religion,

37
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,100
As she is rumored to do,

38
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,700
Then our whole reformation
is surely in jeopardy.

39
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,900
What a suprise, You have
such little faith in the king.

40
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,400
Unless we press ahead the
dissalution of those brothels

41
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,800
And slaughter whores of the conscience.

42
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,600
The monasteries.

43
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,700
In nomine patris,

44
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,000
- et filii,et spiritus sancti. Amen
- Almighty and everlasting god

45
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,600
give onto us the increase of faith

46
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,100
- Hope and charity.???
- and that we may obtain

47
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,500
that which thou dost promise,

48
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,900
Make us to love that which thou dost
command Through jesus christ, our lord.

49
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,200
Amen.

50
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Madam,

51
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,800
if i may, I have a
wedding gift for your majesty.

52
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,100
It once belonged to queen katherine.

53
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,400
Thank you.

54
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,000
His majesty, the king.

55
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,600
Wife.

56
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,900
Husband.

57
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,900
I don't think we need
to proceed in public.

58
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,700
Not this time.

59
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,100
- Majesty.
- Majesty.

60
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,800
Yorkshire Northern England

61
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,100
Make way!

62
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,000
Sawley Abbey

63
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,300
Make way, the king's commissioners.

64
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,200
- Be assure everything is accounted for.
- Yes, dr. Frankish.

65
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,200
Dr. Frankish, here's a wealthy madonna.

66
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,600
Here is a fine one.

67
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,300
Coat of silk, ton of
jewels, wealth property.

68
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,200
Well, lady,

69
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,600
Are you stripped now?

70
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,700
Mr. Aske.

71
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,400
Look what they've done, john.

72
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,500
Just look.

73
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
It's all cromwell's doing.

74
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,700
Cromwell and that sect of
heretics in london, That bustard.

75
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,800
I'll tell you this mr. Aske, people,
They're no longer willing to stand by,

76
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,500
And watch their faith, And
everything that they care for,

77
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,100
Being stripped away.

78
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,100
I heard just yesterday,

79
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,800
That two of cromwell's commisioners
were attacked In lincolnshire.

80
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,100
And here in yorkshire,

81
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,200
And a man of the commons
Stood up in his own church

82
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,700
And said go away to follow the crosses.

83
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,700
For what they've taken from us,

84
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,300
We can follow them no more.

85
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,000
What am i supposed to do, john?

86
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,900
The commons here,
in lincolnshire, everywhere.

87
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,600
They're prepared to fight,
To save what they love.

88
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,700
But they need captains,

89
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,100
They need clever,
educated man to lead them.

90
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,500
- I'm no leader, john.
- Don't decide now.

91
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,700
We'll call a meeting,

92
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,500
Then decide.

93
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,200
For the love of god.

94
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,900
Take a look at that.

95
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,100
Our commisioners found it in sawly abbey.

96
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,700
How was it done?

97
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,900
See it yourself.

98
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,700
People thought the
saint's bones were alive

99
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,900
Use it work for benedictions.

100
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,500
If they pay a little money
they had to the church

101
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,700
and to rome. How do
our reforms progress?

102
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,900
As you know, my lord.

103
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,500
Parliament has now voted for the suppression
Of all the small monastery houses

104
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,100
And the commisioners are upon
and about their businesses

105
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,600
In nearly every county in england...

106
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,200
much opposition?

107
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,600
Not as much as we might have expected.

108
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,700
Why should we have expected it?

109
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,000
People conceive for themselves

110
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,100
That all these houses should be condemned

111
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,500
For their manifest sin:
carnal and abundable living.

112
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,900
I was told, one anecdote among many.

113
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,600
When our commisioners entered the
london houses of the crossed friars

114
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,300
They found the prayer himself,
in babel disorder.

115
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Both stunned and naked.

116
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,900
They often bribes to go away.

117
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,400
It is true that ordinary people
are so greedy Upon these houses

118
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,600
when they are suppressed.

119
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,300
They scavenge in the night
and day untill nothing is left.

120
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:48,500
They even take the books, to use
for paper in their houses of easement.

121
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,800
How about the gains of king's treasure?

122
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,200
So far, by my reckoning,We have
already doubled the king's income

123
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,800
And taken in possesion of the monastic
lands Worth many millions of pounds.

124
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,700
Millions?

125
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,900
Yes, mr. Secretary.

126
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,900
Sir edward seymour.

127
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,000
Sir edward,

128
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,600
As the brother of his
majesty's beloved wife, jane,

129
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,000
It is his majesty's
pleasure today to creat you

Also to appoint you a governor of jersy
And chancellor of north wales.

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,400
And i assure your majesty

134
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,400
that i would labor Unremittingly
in your majesty's interest,

135
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,800
In the hope of repaying the
great trust you've shown in me.

136
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,800
My lord,

137
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
here are your letters patent.

138
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,500
May i congratulate you on your elevation.

139
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,300
Mr. Secratary.

140
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,900
Thomas, what are the businesses there?

141
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,300
Your majesty has received
a letter from the emperor,

142
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,700
Congratulating your new marriage.

143
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,600
Since he's no further impediment,

144
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,300
He's very anxious to
become a new accommodation.

145
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,000
Good. What else?

146
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,000
The lady mary has also
written to you, majesty.

147
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,400
What does she want?

148
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,800
She writes, that it is time now
to forget the unhappy past,

149
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,300
She begs to be taken by
your majesty's forgiveness

150
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,500
And humbly beseeches you to remember

151
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,600
That i am a humbled woman and your child.

152
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,600
I'll never take her back.

153
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,400
Not until she first submit herself to me

154
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,600
The subject of his mother's
marriage and surprint.

155
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,900
You'll send the delegation

156
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,000
If she trully wants to
forget the unhappy past,

157
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,300
Then she can stop by signing it.

158
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,000
- Majesty.
- Groom.

159
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200

I'm sure i know. Thanks for that.

163
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,800
I may have a small job for you, soon.

164
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,200

165
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,500

Wish you good health and prosperity.

175

Although the device of the lady

176
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,400
who proceeded you On the
throne was the most happy.

177
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,300
I have no doubt that it is you,
yourself who will realise that mortal.

178
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,500
Thank you, excellency.

179
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,600
I know that the emperor will
rejoice of Such a virtual ascent

180
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,400
and amiable queen on the throne.

181
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,800
I must tell you it would be impossible
for me to overstate the joy

182
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,400
And happiness which each englsih men

183
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,700
that i have met Have expressed
to me on hearing of your marriage.

184
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,400
Especially, as it is said,
that you're a peace-Maker

185
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,500
who'll be continually Trying to persuade his
majesty to restore his daughter mary to favor.

186
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,500
I promise you, excellency.

187
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,100
That i would continue to
show favor to the lady mary.

188
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,600
And do my best to deserve
the title of peace-Maker

189
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,600
You so gallantly have given me.

190
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,100
If you do so,

191
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,800
i think you'll find madam that Without
the pain of labour, and childbirth,

192
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,500
You'll gain a treasure of the daughter

193
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,300
Who may please you even more
Than your own children by the king.

194
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,800
I can only say again, excellency.

195
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,500
That i will do my best to restore the peace

196
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,900
Between the king and his eldest daughter.

197
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,000
- Ambassordor.
- Madam.

198
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,500
Madam.

199
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,500
You're the first ambassordor she's received.

200
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,000
She is not yet used to see such audiences.

201
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,900
But it is true what they say.

202
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,000
She is kind and amiable,
And much inclined towards peace.

203
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,900
I swear, for example,

204
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,300
She would strive to prevent me
taking part in a foreign war.

205
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,200
If only to avoid the fear
and pain of separation.

206
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,300
If you are on war, your
majesty, against whom?

207
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,400
I was talking hypothetically.

208
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,800
Surely you'll do that
youself, your excellency.

209
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,300
Thanks for coming.

210
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,800
Thank you.

211
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,900
Friends! Friends.

212
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,600
We've come here, so you
can listen to and talk to

213
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,000
This good man, mr. Robert aske.

214
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
Now some of you have already known him,

215
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,900
He is the duke of
northampton's legal man.

216
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,100
He's always been honest and fair minded
In these dealings with the commons so...

217
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,400
mr. Aske can speak for himself.

218
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,900
- Ladies and(evening???) gentlmen.
- evening.

219
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,800
Now, tell me what is your want.

220
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,600
Mr aske,

221
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,300
all of our faith days
were abolished and gone.

222
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,900
Should it pleased the king's grace
that we might have our holy days back.

223
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,500
We want our abbeyes restored.

224
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,300
And demand that this
advance of heresy be halted.

225
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,500
We want this new heretic bishop
like cranmer be casted off.

226
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Even cromwell to besurplanted
by man of noble birth.

227
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,700
We hear rumors, mr. Aske,
that new taxes levy's against us

228
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:33,100
On our cattle, and our christenings
On our marriages, and our births.

229
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:39,600
Aske,they even destroy our perish
churches and steal our treasures.

230
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
All right, gentlemen.
All right, gentlemen.

231
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,600
What do you reckon you
can do to stop them.

232
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,400
Mr. Aske,

233
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,600
before our lands,
our good to their houses

234
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,000
Are taken from by the church
commissioners. We'll fight.

235
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,000
And we'll die,

236
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,900
die after full ultimate, mr. Aske.

237
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,100
I know you are angry.

238
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,200
The destruction of the abbeys
is a terrible and criminal thing.

239
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,500
Since that represents by that very
presence and exotic ideal to of all of us.

240
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,700
But gentlemen, this call to arms,

241
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
to rebellion against the king's grace

242
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,100
Is something which are my
conscience i cannot agree to.

243
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,100
Since the king is our body and soul.

244
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:38,200
Then an attack upon him is an attack
upon the commonwealth and upon god himself.

245
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,100
Did you hear that, my mates

246
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,800
The gentry doesn't care for us.

247
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,800
Christ die for the poor.

248
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,500
Do you remember that, mr. Aske?

249
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,000
Lady misseldon, your majesty.

250
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,500
Lady misseldon.

251
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,700
Your majesty.

252
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,700
Do your duties honournably and virtuesly?

253
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,800
And remember, you are
all bound to serve and obey.

254
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,200
Lady rochford.

255
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,100
Your majesty.

256
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,900
Please.

257
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,500
I ask to see you.

258
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,800
I know that the things
have not gone well for you

259
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,900
since your husband was executed.

260
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,600
I have been utterly abandoned.

261
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,100
I feel i was condemed
because of what george did.

262
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,000
Even mr cromwell has
refused to answer my letters.

263
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,100
Nothing was your fault.

264
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,900
George bolyen was his own keeper.

265
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,700
I want you to come back to court.

266
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,800
And i'd like to appoint you
my principal lady in waiting.

267
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,800
I hope you'll accept this position.

268
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,800
Thank you, your majesty.

269
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,400
Well then, lady rochford.

270
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,400
All is well again.

2
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,600
All is mended up.

3
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,800
HUNSDOND HOUSE
HERTFORDSHIRE

4
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,200
Sir francis bryan, my lady.

5
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,900
- Lady mary.
- my lord.

6
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,800
I'm very glad you've come to see me.

7
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,400
I've written a letter congratulating
the king on his marriage.

8
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,100
And begging leave to
wait upon queen jane.

9
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,800
Or do her grace such services
would please her to command me.

10
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,700
I'm afraid, lady mary. I've not
come here to discuss pleasentaries.

11
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,100
His majesty urged
you to sign this.

12
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,300
What is it?

13
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,000
A list of articles.

14
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,200
Recognising the king
as head of the church,

15
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,900
And your mother's marriage
just incestuous and unlawful.

16
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,500
You must also renounce rome

17
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,700
and free acknowledged
of your illegitamacy.

18
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,700
If you not sign,

19
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,900
i'm afraid mr secretary cromwell

20
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,600
can not guarantee your safety.

21
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,600
However much i love
my father, your grace.

22
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,800
And would do anything to please
and satisfy him, i still cannot

23
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,500
risk my mortal soul for
the favor of an unearthly king.

24
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,400
You're an unfitlial daughter.

25
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,300
Since you're not submit
to your father.

26
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,300
He may yet procceed
against you for treason.

27
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,400
No, no he would not.

28
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,100
I cannot believe it.

29
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,300
Listen to me.

30
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,900
I tell you

31
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,800
If you're my daugher,

32
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,700
I would smash your
head against the wall,

33
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,900
until it is soft
as a boiled apple.

34
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,600
Do you understand?

35
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,200
Lady mary.

36
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,000
I've been discussing plans for
your coronation with mr. Holbein.

37
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,300
Have you ever heard
of the centre of Venice?

38
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,900
No, your majesty.

39
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,500
It's a ship.

40
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,200
In which the doge travels out
Into the lagoon every year

41
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,500
to renew its marriage while the sea.

42
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,200
It's a magnificant thing.

43
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,200
The dawn will gold and bronze, statues,

44
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,400
meptune, sea lions and
other fantastic sea creatures...

45
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,100
and i'm going to build it.

46
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,900
And you're going go travel in it,
from greenwich to the city,

47
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,000
Where you'll be crowned,
queen jane of england.

48
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,300
Your majesty,
i... i don't know what to say.

49
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,900
You don't have to say anything.

50
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,200
It will be the most
fabulous coronation

51
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,800
Any english queen has ever had

52
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,700
That i promise you.

53
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,300
Your majesty.
Forgive me.

54
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,800
But i've heard your majesty Make
some proceedings against the lady mary.

55
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,000
With all my heart
i beg you not to.

56
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,500
Are you out of your senses?

57
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,600
Don't talk of such matters again.

58
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,300
Jane,

59
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,500
I have another wedding gift for you.

60
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,500
I hope you like it.

61
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,700
Thank you your majesty.

62
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,500
Oh i love him,
he's so pretty.

63
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,100
Lady misseldon.

64
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,900
Sir francis.

65
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,900
I hope i didn't alarm you.

66
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,500
No sir.

67
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,700
You left me a note that
you wanted to see me?

68
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,900
Yes, i did.

69
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,800
About what.

70
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,700
I was wondering

71
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,200
If you'd like to become my mistress.

72
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,200
Sir, i'm already
engage to be married.

73
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,600
To whom?

74
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,700
Sir robert tavistock.

75
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,700
Can he afford to buy you gifts-

76
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,100
like this?

77
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,400
I didn't think so.

78
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,500
But if it's more important to you 

79
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,100
to keep your virgin then
keep it for what it's worth.

80
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,600
And i swear i wouldn't bother you

81
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,300
or your conscience ever again.

82
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,800
I haven't decided yet.

83
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,700
How can i renounce rome?

84
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,500
Or my mother's marriage.
After all of my mother's sufferings.

85
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
I understand.

86
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,300
But may i suggest that
you could sign the document.

87
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,700
And then make what is
called a protestation apart.

88
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
That is secretly foresware
your submission before witnesses.

89
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,100
Is that not hypocrisy?

90
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,100
Surely the emperor's against
my signing such a document.

91
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,800
And the holy father.

92
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,200
Lady mary,

93
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,300
I must tell you in honesty that-

94
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,900
that the emperor's no longer inclined
to Interfere any further in this matter.

95
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,400
After all,
you are not his subject and-

96
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,900
and since he is seeking
a new alliance with the king,

97
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,000
He would in truth be most reluctant
to offend him in any way.

98
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,300
Then,

99
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,600
i'm on my own?

100
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,700
What if i do not sign it?

101
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,100
It is very possible that
the king would put you to death.

102
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,100
Well,

103
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,700
- Do you...do you not want to read it first?
- No.

104
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Only i ask if you can pray
for absolution for what i've done.

105
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,400
So long as i live,

106
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,900
I will never forgive myself.

107
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,800
CASTLE GANDOLPHO
POPE'S SUMMER RESODEMCE. ITALY

108
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,100
Father pole.

109
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,100
Yes your eminence.

110
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,400
I'm cardinal von waldburg.

111
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
How long have you been as
the servant adhere in rome, father pole?

112
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,600
Almost a year your eminence.

113
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,300
I left england when
to became clear that

114
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,300
the king meant to break his obedience
to see of roman, our holy father.

115
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,100
The death of whore anne
boleyn is perhaps providential.

116
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,100
And his holiness prays
that king henry would

117
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,500
grasp this divine opportunity
for reconciliation.

118
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,200
Just one gesture,

119
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,000
Of he sounds to see
of rome, however small,

120
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,200
Will allow him to leave
the threat of excommunication.

121
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,900
Your eminence believe me,

122
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,400
That is something that the faithful
of england are praying for.

123
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,700
My mother, lady salisbury
has written to me,

124
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,200
expressing her hope
that the new queen is

125
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,200
in her heart a true catholic.

126
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,300
Perhaps your mother
could do more than hope.

127
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
And perhaps you
yourself father pole

128
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,600
might've considering returning
to england.

129
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,000
In order to influence events there.

130
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,700
You see, father pole,

131
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,100
I know who you really are.

132
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,400
Here is the real danae

133
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
She would kindle
your lust even higher.

134
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,100
One touch,

135
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,800
one mere touch of her body,

136
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:22,100
And your limbs will
melt in the fire.

137
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,500
The necklace suits you,

138
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,900
And you're adored.

139
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,800
YORKSHIRE

140
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,100
In nomine patris, et filii,
et spiritus sancti. Amen.

141
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,800
Ave maria, gratia plena,
dominus tecum.

142
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,900
Your majesty has received
a letter from lady bryan,

143
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,200
Governors to the lady elizabeth.

144
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,900
Apparently the child has
outgrown her clothes.

145
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,800
Lady bryan asks if your majesty
would permit Her to purchase new ones.

146
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,900
Why should i-
i don't believe she is my child.

147
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,600
The whole world knows their father's a traitor
henry norris and their mother was a whore.

148
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,000
What else?

149
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,500
There's letters,

150
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,200
the submission of the lady mary.

151
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,200
You will make arrangements for myself
and the queen to meet with her.

152
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,700
Not here and not publicly.

153
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,900
We will go to her residence.

154
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,000
There're rumors
of plague in the city.

155
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,900
Coronation would have
to be postponed.

156
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,000
Your majesty.

157
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,500
Thomas.

158
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,700
Mr.Richard showed me the figures.

159
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
I'm very pleased with you tom.

160
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,600
I will shortly prove it.

161
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,400
Lady rochford.

162
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,200
Yes, your majesty.

163
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,500
Take this to lady bryan,

164
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,400
Tell her to use it buy clothes
for the lady elisabeth.

165
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,800
Yes, madam.

166
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,100
And you must think of
a gift for the lady mary.

167
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,500
I'm looking so forward
to meeting her.

168
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,200
Your majesty is very kind.

169
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,100
Lady rochford,

170
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,600
it's not your fault that
your husband betrayed you.

171
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,000
Nor is it mary's fault or elizabeth's
fault to be born of a king.

172
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,100
Women are much put
upon in this world.

173
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,800
It's my desire as much as
i can to promote their interests.

174
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,300
I must do it quietly.

175
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,600
But i will do it all the same.

176
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,800
And i trust you'd help me.

177
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,700
Yes, your majesty.

178
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,000
What's your name, man.

179
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,100
Charlie, sir.
Charlie roll.

180
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,600
Trade?

181
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,400
Shepherd.

182
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,100
Mr. Secretary cromwell.

183
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,300
Kneel.

184
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,100
Do you know well about it,

185
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,900
Yes, captain aske.

186
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,000
We're not rebels,

187
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,700
We're pilgrimages

188
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,300
And we have a pilgrimage to go on.

189
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,700
If you want to join us then you shall
swear to be true to our mighty god.

00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,600
To christ catholic church.

191
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,100
To our sovereign lord, the king.

192
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,800
And to the commons of this realm,

193
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,400

194
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,000

196
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,100
It show the five wounds of christ.

197
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:37,100
To prove that the commons
will fight in christ cause.


198
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,600
Yes, captain.

199
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,900

200
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,200

Arise, sir thomas cromwell,

202
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,900
Also baron cromwell of wimbledon.

203
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,200
And from this day forth,

204
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,100
Lord privy seal.

205
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,700
Majesty.

206
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,900
Your grace. Your grace.

207
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,500
May i, son?

208
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,100
God be with you lad.

209
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Your majesty is too kind.

210
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,900
Mary,

211
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,100
gifts like these are easy compared
with gifts of a heart.

212
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,300
It gives more pleasure than i can say
to see you reconcile with your father.

213
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,100
Mary.

214
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,800
Your majesty.

215
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,400
Here is enough
for a thousand crowns.

216
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,600
If you need anything
else you need only ask.

217
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,500
Thank you, your majesty.

218
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,000
Father.

219
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,900
Yes, father.

220
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,400
Mary's so sweet and affectional.

221
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
She's everything i heard should be.

222
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,900
It seems to be no wonder
she's so marvelous and beloved

223
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,600
for her virtue and goodness
in the hearts of the people.

224
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,000
Your majesty must invite her
to the court, show her off.

225
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,400
Your majesty,

226
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,600
Why were you not speak to me?

227
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,100
Because i'm disappointed.

228
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,200
Why?

229
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,200
I'm disappointed because
you're not yet with child.

230
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
Lord,

231
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,600
my lord, my lord.

232
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,300
We have come here in great haste

233
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,100
to tell you that
the great part of the north

234
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:33,800
as well as part of lincolnshire have risen
in sudden rebellion against his majesty.

235
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,000
There are master
of commons everywhere.

236
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,200
The beacons of rebellion burning 
heir own light to cross the hills.

237
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,900
Just four days ago,

238
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
While we're collecting
taxes and hectinsome

239
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,300
We were set upon by an angry mob.

240
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,900
They captured one of the
commissioners call nicolas bello.

241
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,600
Pull him down from his hourse

242
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,400
and beat him to death
with their stave.

243
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,400
Among them, my lord,
we saw armed priests.

244
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,400
Urging on these rebellion's names
And cries 'kill them, kill them'.

245
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,900
Then we heard another man,
william lichie,

246
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,900
Who is known to be
your servant mr. Cromwell

247
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,200
have been hanged from a tree.

248
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,300
And what these rebels
said they want?

249
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,100
so far i can tell you,
they want to keep their holy days.

250
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,100
They want monasteries restored
and their church unelested, and...

251
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,800
no more taxed.

252
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,900
I heard they declared
they prospaid with their journey.

253
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,100
They intend to kill you,
my lord crownwell.

254
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,600
454 or 5 bishops,
and chancellor richie

255
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,300
as deviced taken church goods,
and tearing down churches.

256
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,300
Why dont the local gentry intervince
and serpress these traitors and wait.

257
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,700
Surely they want to protect
their lands than holy days.

258
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,100
They tried,

259
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,900
but the rebels then
come back even greater.

260
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,500
Some say, my lord crownwell,

261
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:57,800
they are not hundreds but thousands religion
rebelions against the king's church reforms

262
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,300
Why did you know,

263
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,100
you are suposed to know
everything that goes on here?

264
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,800
You told me there was little
opposition, on the contrary.

265
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,800
You told me that most people was
glad to see such places dissolved.

266
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,900
You were wrong.

267
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,100
You didn't know anything,

268
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,700
knave.

269
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,300
Sit down, write this.

270
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,900
We take it as greatest unkindness,

271
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
that our common unfearist objects
should rise agasint without any grounds.

272
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,500
As for taking the goods from
perish church which is never intended.

273
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,000
Yet even it had been intended.

274
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,300
True subjects would
have not dealt with me,

275
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,600
their princess in such violence.

276
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,500
But would petition me for that purpose.

277
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,800
Now,

278
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,900
i command you rebels to go home,

279
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,600
and say no more.

280
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,800
And remember your allegiance,

281
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,600
you are duly bound to to obey me,

282
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,200
your king.

283
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,500
Both by god's commoments,

284
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,000
and by the law of nature.

285
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,400
(LINCOLNSHIRE)
All commands, stick together

286
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,200
Now it's the time to arise,

287
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,100
for else ever

288
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,900
So forwards,

289
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,300
forwrds to york.

290
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,300
Forwards in pain of death.

291
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,600
Forwards in god's name,

292
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,500
forwards.

293
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,600
Writing to the gentry of yorkshire

294
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,400
Reminding them of their duties
to suppress these traitors,

295
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,800
penalties in not doing so...

296
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,400
so any case,

297
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,200
for suspending the work
of church commisioners,

298
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,700
- until rebels...
- no,

299
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,200
the only way to beat the king's

300
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,200
Authority into the hands
of rude people of north

301
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,100
Is to show them king's intend
to continue with reformation

302
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,400
And correction religion
whatever they say.

303
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,700
What ever they do

304
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,800
Yes

305
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,200
My lord

306
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,700
The rebels have taken lincoln

307
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,500
The rebels flag flies
over city gate

308
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,800
and more of them are
now marching on york.

309

00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,500
My god, help us

310
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,900
when i was 5,

311
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,300
my mother and i were taken
accross london, into the tower.

312
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,300
There was a rebelion
against my father.

313
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,400
The cornish rebels
reached the city walls,

314
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,500
And inside everything was

315
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,600
panic, fear.

316
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,500
With no news at all,
nor army of my father.

317
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,600
My mother tried to remain calm,

318
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,700
she was terrified.

319
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,500
So was i,

320
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,300
I was sure we were
both going to be killed.

321
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,600
I'm appointing you command
of the royal forces,

322
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,200
You will arrive north
as soon as possible,

323
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,600
You will find guns and ordnances
of hunger, but don't tarry there

324
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,000
No, your majesty,

325
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,600
i will do all your majesty
commands and more

326
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,600
These rebels are
our traitors, charles.

327
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,300
Full of wretched
and devilish intense.

328
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,700
They must be punished,

329
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:09,700
For their detestable and unmature sin
of rebellion against their sirvior

330
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,800
Just as my father,

331
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
punish the cornishmen.

332
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,600
Charles, what is going on?

333
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,900
- Leave us.
- Yes your grace.

334
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,600
His majesty has charged me

335
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,400
would lead his army
against north rebels.

336
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,400
You are not to worry,

337
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:35,100
i will have my back enough men
and arms to subdue them.

338
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,700
Easily, i have his majesty's promise.

339
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,000
I hope to god, he keeps it.

340
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,000
I'm happy to accept this charge

341
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,500
Crownwell is being
blamed for everything,

342
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,100
And the rebels is demanding
his head with god's help.

343
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,400
I may will be able to deliver it.

344
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
The lord privy seal

345
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,100
I'll despatch duke of
surffolk to the royal army.

346
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,500
If we need to send the second
army to destroy the rebels.

347
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,800
Yes, your mejesty.

348
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,600
Unless they disperse

349
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,000
and said 100 of their ringleaders
to the duke of surffolk

350
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,300
of with halters around their necks.

351
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,600
Then he has our permission to burn

352
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,000
to destroy all their goods.

353
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,600
And make a fearful example
of them to all of our subjects.

354
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,100
Yes, majesty.

355
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,600
If still they do not submit,
mr. Cromwell,

356
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,500
then i promise the utter
destruction of them.

357
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,200
Their wives and their children.

358
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Do you understand me?

359
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,300
i will destroy them all.

360
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,400
And then i'll destroy you, cromwell.

361
