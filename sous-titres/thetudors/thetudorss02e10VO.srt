00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,490
<i>Previously on Tudors...</i>

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:04,840
In this ippery world you represent
for me all that is innocent.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,040
- Everything that is good.
- What is that?

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,180
- Let me see it.
- Ah!

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,120
We have come so far. No one is
going to be allowed to destroy us.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,950
Do you understand?

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,490
In the question of
legitimizing the Lady Mary,

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,320
there remains one great obstacle.
We must find a way around it.

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,730
There are some rumors about
the Queen's behavior. It seems,

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,800
she entertains men in her room at
night and behaves intimately with them.

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,970
It's true that some men came
into the Queen's chambers.

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,200
- What are their names?
- The King's groom, Brereton...

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,940
- And Sir Henry Norris,
and Mark Smeaton - And?!

14
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,040
Well I saw her hugging
and kissing her brother.

15
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,210
You are both arrested for
High Treason, and having...

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,610
- ...carnal knowledge of her
Majesty the Queen. - What?

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,950
For the love of Elizabeth!
Have mercy!

18
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,690
You lied to me! You've always lied
to me. You are not what you seem!

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,990
This is the warrant for your arrest. You
are charged with committing adultery.

20
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,430
We are come at the King's command
to conduct you to the Tower.

21
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,100
She's humiliated me,
Charles! I hate her!

22
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,730
For such awful adultery, there
should be only one punishment.

23
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,310
The Queen was tried yesterday.

24
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,970
She was sentenced to
death either by burning

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,010
or decapitation according
to the King's pleasure.

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,750
Most people think I've changed.
At heart, I'm still a humanist.

27
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,720
I promise you that I shall
be remembered eternally.

28
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,650
I have no doubt whatsoever that your
Majesty's reign will always be remembered.

29
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,150
The Tudors
Season 2 -  Episode 10

30
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,440
I will give glory to thee O Lord:
for you have saved me

31
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,540
from injustice, from slanderous
tongues and an unjust king.

32
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,980
My soul shall praise thee
even to the last to my death,

33
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,110
for thou deliveries
those that wait for thee.

34
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,390
ENOUGH!

35
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,930
Make way for Princess Elizabeth.

36
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,570
Make way there.

37
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:09,270
Make way for her Grace.

38
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,790
- Master Kingston.
- My Lady.

39
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,130
My Lady, I can now tell you
that the King has decreed

40
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,300
that you will not be burned,
but suffer a quicker death

41
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,340
by decapitation.

42
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,640
In his mercy, the King has
also acceded to your plea

43
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,710
to use the services of
the Executioner of Calais,

44
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,150
who is even now on his
way here from Dover.

45
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,760
- When am I to die?
- At nine o'clock.

46
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,160
I am content.

47
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,970
Will you please send
for Archbishop Cranmer,

48
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,970
so he may hear my last confession
and administer Holy Communion?

49
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,770
My Lady.

50
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,680
"To the Emperor. Nephew.

51
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,150
"This day will
bring you, I think,

52
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,320
"news of great satisfaction.

53
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,030
"Let us put all
quarrels behind us.

54
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,960
"And work for an accommodation
that will increase the trade

55
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,130
"and prosperity between us.

56
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,940
"And unite us against that
bastard, the King of France.

57
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,720
"Above all, I love the
prospect of change."

58
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,040
Master Kingston, tell
me, how is the Lady?

59
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,110
Truthfully, in the early
days of her captivity

60
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,480
she often spoke rather wildly.

61
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,250
For example, that it would not
rain until she was released.

62
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,720
But now, according
to her almoner,

63
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,560
preparations for death have
increasingly occupied her thoughts,

64
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,800
and so I believe she
is reconciled to it.

65
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,730
I am glad.

66
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,070
Although...

67
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,000
it grieves that I must
cause her further pain.

68
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,450
My Lady, I am
obliged to tell you

69
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,650
that your marriage to the King
has been declared null and void.

70
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,320
On what grounds?

71
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,220
On the grounds of your close
and forbidden degree of affinity

72
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,160
to another woman known
carnally by the King.

73
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,060
My sister...

74
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,800
- Then my daughter is...?
- Yes.

75
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,570
Elizabeth is to be
declared a bastard.

76
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,440
Madam, I swear to you I will
do everything within my power

77
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,880
to protect and support her,
and keep her always

78
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,950
in the King's good
and kind graces.

79
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,850
Thank you.

80
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,720
And now, since my
time approaches,

81
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,720
I beg your Grace to
hear my confession.

82
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,770
Also, I should like
the Constable present

83
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,500
when I receive the good Lord.

84
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,670
Madam.

85
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,450
My child, do you
have a confession?

86
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,050
Yes.

87
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,660
I confess my
innocence before God.

88
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,930
I solemnly swear,
on the damnation of my soul,

89
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,230
that I have never been
unfaithful to my lord and husband,

90
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,700
nor ever offended with
my body against him.

91
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,340
I do not say that I have
always borne towards him

92
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,880
the humility which I owed him,

93
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,850
considering his kindness and
the great honor he showed me

94
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,050
and the great respect
he always paid me.

95
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,050
I admit, too, that I have
often taken it into my head

96
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,620
to be jealous of him.

97
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,860
But God knows,
and is my witness,

98
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,760
I have not sinned against
him in any other way.

99
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,400
Think not I say this in
the hope to prolong my life.

100
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,840
God has taught me how to die,
and He will strengthen my faith.

101
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,740
As for my brother...

102
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,050
...and those others who
were unjustly condemned,

103
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,590
I would willingly have suffered
many deaths to deliver them,

104
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,260
but since I see it
pleases the King,

105
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,630
I will willingly
accompany them in death.

106
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,230
With this assurance:

107
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,870
that I shall lead an endless
life with them in peace.

108
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,620
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

109
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,160
Master Kingston.

110
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,730
Please go and make sure to report
my Lady's true and last confession,

111
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,030
so the world will know it.

112
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,640
I will.

113
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,210
Mr. Cranmer, I do not suppose
that, even at this last hour,

114
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,320
the evangelical bishops that we
put in place might intervene for me?

115
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,050
Your Majesty, I...

116
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,790
No, I understand.

117
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,990
How could they? Forgive me.

118
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,260
<i>Gaudeamus omnes in Domino, per
omnia saecula saeculorum. Amen.</i>

119
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:59,070
Is it done? Is
the harlot dead?

120
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,810
I don't know. But, certainly,
she will be dead before very long.

121
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,310
The Lord is good.

122
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,950
Tell me: why is
she really to die?

123
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:18,490
They say that her child, Elizabeth,

124
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,530
was not conceived
with the King at all,

125
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,760
but with one of her
countless lovers.

126
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,700
How many lovers was
she supposed to have?

127
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,570
According to Mr. Cromwell,
over a hundred men,

128
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:33,070
including her brother, Rochford.

129
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:40,250
But I'm told she also blames
me for what has befallen her,

130
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,950
and holds me
accountable for her doom.

131
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,460
Naturally I am flattered
by the compliment,

132
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,230
since she would have thrown
me to the dogs if she could.

133
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,590
Tell me about this other Lady,

134
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,400
this Jane Seymour?

135
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,800
I have been told in confidence
that she is of our faith,

136
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,800
and that the King loves her,
and means to marry her.

137
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,140
And that she means to restore
your grace to the succession.

138
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,940
And Elizabeth will
become a bastard now?

139
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:13,580
- As I have been a bastard?
- Yes, Princess.

140
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,820
The brat is now
officially a bastard.

141
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,280
Tell them to ready the horses.

142
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,010
- But tell no one of our destination.
- Yes, Majesty.

143
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,620
To every thing
there is a season,

144
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,990
and a time to every
purpose under heaven.

145
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,760
A time to be born,
and a time to die.

146
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,470
A time to plant and a time to
pluck up that which is planted.

147
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,670
A time to weep,

148
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,440
and a time to laugh.

149
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,310
A time to cast away stones,

150
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,940
and a time to gather
stones together.

151
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,090
A time to mourn,
and a time to dance.

152
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,730
That which hath been is now.

153
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,870
And that which is to
be has already been...

154
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,540
A time to get,
and a time to lose.

155
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:54,180
A time to keep,
and a time to cast away.

156
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,090
A time to rend,
and a time to sew.

157
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,720
A time to keep silence,
and a time to speak.

158
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,740
I said in my heart, God shall judge
the righteous and the wicked,

159
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:21,140
for there is a time for
every purpose under the sun.

160
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,310
Am I to go now? I thought...

161
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,180
My Lady, forgive me...

162
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,790
The executioner has been
delayed on the road from Dover

163
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,760
and your execution is
postponed until twelve o'clock.

164
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,730
I wanted to tell you,
in good time, in case...

165
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:44,200
Master Kingston.

166
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,130
I hear you say I will
not die before noon,

167
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,870
and I'm sorry for it,

168
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,940
for I thought to be dead by
that time, and past my pain.

169
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,910
Madam, there will be no pain.

170
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:58,110
The blow will be so subtle.

171
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,750
Yes, I heard the
executioner was very good.

172
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:10,090
And in any case,
I have only a little neck.

173
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,950
- Edward!
- Ah!

174
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,190
- Ha!
- Ah!

175
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,730
Father?

176
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,900
Sir?

177
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,110
- HA!
- Ah!

178
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,780
My God.

179
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:12,350
Edward, this is not a toy.

180
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,290
Yes, sir.

181
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,700
So, have you ever
killed someone?

182
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:31,640
Yes. In battle.

183
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,770
What did it feel like?

184
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,980
He was my enemy.

185
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,010
I didn't care.

186
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,320
I would really like
to see someone die.

187
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,050
Can I go to the
execution with you?

188
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,700
How much did they
charge for the scaffold?

189
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,870
Twenty- three pounds, six shillings
and eight pence, Mr. Secretary.

190
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,000
Daylight robbery.

191
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,700
And what is the Headsman to
be paid, if he ever arrives?

192
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,840
Fifteen pounds.

193
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,080
Fifteen pounds?

194
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,050
For one stroke?

195
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:16,850
My God, he makes
a damn good living!

196
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,730
<i>Allons, vas- y. Allons- y.</i>

197
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,730
<i>On y va. Viens!</i>

198
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,390
-  Well, is it done?
- Uh...

199
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,730
Is it?

200
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,730
No, your Majesty.
Uh... Unfortunately,

201
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,370
we must postpone
the execution again.

202
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,670
- What?
- The Executioner was delayed.

203
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,040
Then you fetch somebody
else! Do you hear?

204
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,980
Fetch back the axman
who did the others!

205
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,150
He was good enough wasn't he?
He didn't botch the thing.

206
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,750
Your Majesty made a promise.

207
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,150
Why should I care about my
promises to that whore?!

208
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,030
Your Majesty's promise is
public knowledge. That is all...

209
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,100
I still don't care!

210
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,740
I ordered you to get someone
else! I want her dead!

211
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,840
I want it over with! Finished!

212
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,970
Go and do it or by God's
blood you will join her!

213
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,920
I said!

214
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,690
Postpone it!

215
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,730
Majesty.

216
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,430
Let's go.

217
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,450
Master Kingston, I am ready.

218
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,860
My Lady, you must
forgive me once again.

219
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:41,730
But the Executioner
is still not arrived.

220
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,530
What do you say?

221
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,700
Madam, your execution is put off
until nine o'clock tomorrow morning.

222
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,040
No...

223
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,810
No. It cannot be.

224
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,380
It is not that I
desire death, but I...

225
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,860
I thought myself prepared
to die... I was prepared.

226
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:16,760
I fear... I fear that of further
delay it may weaken my resolve.

227
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,670
Please... If it...
If it were possible...

228
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,740
No, Madam. It is the
King's express command.

229
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,880
No! Wait! Perhaps
I'm not meant to die.

230
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,950
These postponements
they mean something.

231
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,250
Perhaps the King
is testing me.

232
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,690
I'll be sent to a nunnery.

233
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,060
Hiya! Whou!

234
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,050
I am sure you
are aware, Sir John,

235
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,820
that my marriage has been
declared null and void.

236
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,790
I have been made aware of the
circumstances, your Majesty.

237
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,260
And, like everyone else,
I have been shocked

238
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,760
and utterly amazed
by what I've heard.

239
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,200
I am grateful.
But I must tell you...

240
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,300
The Privy Council,
despite these recent hurts,

241
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,840
have pleaded with me to venture
once more into matrimony,

242
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:06,670
in the hope that my bride
will produce a legitimate heir.

243
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,710
I think you know my choice
has fallen upon your daughter.

244
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:16,080
I do.

245
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:24,460
Tomorrow you will all travel
by barge to Hampton Court,

246
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,730
where our betrothal
will be announced.

247
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,730
I swear to you, Sir John, from tomorrow,
everything will be different.

248
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,140
We will be young and
merry as we used to be.

249
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,710
- Lady Jane.
- Your Majesty.

250
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:47,210
Lady Jane!

251
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,820
I won't wear it!
You can't make me!

252
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:56,490
No! No! I'm not going!

253
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,490
Lady Elizabeth, you must do
as you are told! Now hush!

254
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,660
Or I will hit you.

255
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Don't look like that, girl!

256
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:13,170
We are ordered to remove the child so
she can be kept out of sight of the King.

257
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,810
- Little Princess.
- She is no longer a Princess.

258
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,250
She is a bastard. And Master Cromwell
has asked for her accounts to be settled.

259
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:27,820
Also in respect of necessities
provided for her mother in the Tower.

260
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,490
You mean, the child should pay
for her mother's imprisonment?

261
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,030
Yes. Out of the money the
King pays for her household.

262
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,530
Exactly.

263
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,700
The world is a
slippery place, my Lady.

264
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,970
If you would take my advice,
for what it's worth,

265
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,910
find a rich man to marry who is too
stupid to know anything about politics.

266
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:52,380
Then, perhaps, unless you die
in childbirth, which is likely,

267
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,950
or the plague, which
is almost inevitable...

268
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,780
then you will be happy.

269
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,730
What would you like to
talk about, sweetheart?

270
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,840
If your Majesty would allow, I should
like to talk about your daughter Mary.

271
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,710
When I am Queen I would hope to
see her reinstated as heir apparent.

272
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,310
Jane, you're a fool to hope so.

273
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:29,480
You ought to solicit
the advancement

274
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:32,290
of the children we're going
to have, not any others.

275
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,860
But, Your Majesty, I thought
I was asking not so much

276
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,190
for the good of others, as
for the good, of the repose

277
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,390
and tranquility of yourself,

278
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,600
as well as the children
we may have ourselves.

279
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,800
And for the tranquility
of your Majesty's kingdom.

280
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,040
Forgive me.

281
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,840
It's just that I so much
want a new beginning.

282
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,340
A renaissance.

283
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,720
Sometimes it is hard to be reminded
of things. Do you understand?

284
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,060
You are so pure.

285
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,000
I just don't want you to be affected
by things that have gone before.

286
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,010
May I kiss you, Jane?

287
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,980
Aren't you the King of England?

288
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,660
Everything will change for her.

289
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:47,260
That kiss is her destiny,
and her fortune.

290
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,800
And ours.

291
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:03,580
You know, when I was a girl, I served
at the court of Margaret of Austria.

292
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,710
It was a wonderful time.

293
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,050
Pageants and dances.

294
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,950
So many dances.

295
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,660
I once appeared as the
Queen of the Amazons,

296
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,520
with a naked sword in my hand,

297
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,690
and a crimson headdress
with a great plume!

298
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,760
But Margaret was wise, too.

299
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,800
She said to us: "Trust in
those who offer you service,

300
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,640
"and in the end, my maidens,

301
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,610
"you will find
yourself in the ranks

302
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,580
of those who have
been deceived."

303
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,280
Am I...

304
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,180
Am I to be tried?

305
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,720
No. You are to be released.

306
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,790
But, his Majesty commands,

307
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,760
that since you no longer
enjoy his trust or affection,

308
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,070
you are to be
stripped forthwith

309
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,000
of all your official
posts and titles.

310
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,800
You will no longer serve
on the Privy Council,

311
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,170
you will relinquish the
role of Lord Privy Seal,

312
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,770
and all its privileges.

313
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,940
His Majesty also desires
that you leave court.

314
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,710
And that you never show
yourself in his presence again

315
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,650
On pain of death.

316
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,620
So I am to keep my earldom?

317
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,130
Did you watch your son die?

318
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,030
What about your daughter?

319
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,270
Will you watch her suffer?

320
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,170
Will you watch her die?

321
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:17,210
Tell me, Boleyn:
was it all worth it?

322
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,070
Halt!

323
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:28,150
Do see this?

324
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,750
Do you know what this is?

325
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,660
It's the Fountain of Youth.

326
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,240
Look!

327
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,810
I am re- born!

328
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,820
This way, Monsieur.

329
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,160
I deeply regret
you were delayed.

330
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,700
May I see it?

331
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,340
Si vous voulez, Monsieur.

332
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,750
It's beautiful, no?

333
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,450
The execution is
ordered for nine o'clock.

334
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,460
You will be awoken two hours before,
in order for you to have breakfast.

335
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,190
- So, if that is all?
- No, Monsieur.

336
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,700
I must say a few words.

337
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,130
The lady must not to be
restrained in any way.

338
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,500
But, it is very
important that the lady

339
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,640
doesn't look back like this
for the fear of the sword.

340
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:40,280
Alors first, I hide the
sword so she cannot see it.

341
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,250
It is totally normal
they want to look around

342
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,750
and see where your death
come from. No? Ha! Ha!

343
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,660
So, when she has finished her
prayers, and is ready to go...

344
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:58,230
I say, to boy in front
of her, "Fetch my sword".

345
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,700
Of course the
lady looks at man.

346
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,470
And this is just the
perfect angle for me.

347
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,870
When she looks at man.
Then I strike.

348
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,610
Then, "Chuck!"

349
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,540
You understand?

350
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,710
I think so, yes.

351
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,480
Oh, it's very quick.
She feel no pain.

352
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,950
Monsieur?

353
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:23,820
You will be not disappointed.

354
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,690
I'm sure.

355
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,090
Thou knowest whether
I deserve this death.

356
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,660
Not my will O Lord,
but thine be done.

357
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,060
I will give glory to thy name,

358
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,400
for thou art my help
and my protection.

359
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:09,700
Thou hast protected
me and preserved me...

360
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,550
<i>Anne!</i>

361
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,790
<i>Anne!</i>

362
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,040
<i>Anne!</i>

363
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,910
<i>He'll get you!</i>

364
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,790
Madam, the hour approaches,
you must make ready.

365
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,940
Acquit yourself of your charge,

366
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,810
for I have been long prepared.

367
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:28,070
The King asks that
you take this purse.

368
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,640
It has twenty pounds in it,

369
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,810
to pay the headsman
for his services

370
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,650
and distribute
alms to the poor.

371
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:42,760
Thank you.

372
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:46,230
Will you and your
ladies follow me.

373
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,650
Master Kingston, I pray
you not to give the signal

374
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,820
for my death until I have spoken
what I have the mind to speak.

375
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,960
Madam.

376
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:54,180
Good Christian people,

377
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,050
I have come here to die,
according to the law,

378
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:03,690
and thus yield myself to
the will of the King, my lord.

379
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,260
Long live the King!

380
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:09,860
And if, in my life, I ever
did offend the King's Grace,

381
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,470
then surely with my
death I do now atone...

382
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,780
I pray and beseech you all,

383
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,510
to pray for the
life of the King.

384
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,820
God save the King!

385
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,590
My sovereign lord and yours,

386
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,860
who is one of the best princes
on the face of the earth,

387
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,360
who has always
treated me so well,

388
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,900
wherefore I submit to
death with a good will,

389
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:50,800
humbly asking pardon
of all the world.

390
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,680
If anyone should
take up my case,

391
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,950
I ask them only
to judge it kindly.

392
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:46,260
Thank you... Thank you.

393
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:07,950
Madame, forgive me
for what I must do.

394
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,950
Gladly.

395
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,820
And here is your purse.

396
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,340
Thus I take my
leave of the world...

397
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,740
- ...and of you.
- Bless you...

398
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,580
And I heartily desire
you all to pray for me.

399
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:44,880
Lord have mercy on you.

400
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,930
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not be in want.

401
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:55,430
He makes me lie down
in green pastures.

402
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,770
He leads me beside
quiet waters...

403
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:01,870
Jesus, receive my soul.

404
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:05,840
O Lord God, have
pity on my soul.

405
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:07,770
To Christ I commend my soul.

406
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:11,780
Jesus Christ receive my soul!
O Lord God have pity on my soul.

407
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,150
Jesus receive my soul.

408
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:18,890
O God have pity on
my soul, Jesus Christ.

409
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:21,690
O Lord God have
pity on my soul.

410
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:25,090
Jesus Christ receive my soul.

411
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,490
Thank you.

412
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,070
Christ receive my soul.
Jesus Christ receive my soul.

413
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:36,370
O Lord God have
pity on my soul.

414
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,540
To Christ I commend myself.

415
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:42,340
Jesus receive my soul.
O Lord God have pity on my soul.

416
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,640
To Christ I commend myself.

417
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:48,180
To Christ I commend myself.

418
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,690
Boy! Fetch my sword!

419
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:48,210
Make way for the
King's household.

420
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,780
Make way.

421
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,050
Make way for the
King's household.

422
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,250
May the Lord Jesus
be drink and food.
