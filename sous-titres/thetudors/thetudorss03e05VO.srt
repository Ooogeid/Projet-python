00:00:00,627 --> 00:00:02,300
Previously on "The Tudors"

2
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:51,594
My own darling...

3
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:56,521
One day,
I shall lie with you again...

4
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,617
I promise.

5
00:02:00,464 --> 00:02:03,014
And we shall sleep together
for eternity.

6
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:56,999
- Get out of the way... fellow.
- Sorry me sir, was you trying to pass?

7
00:02:57,722 --> 00:03:00,322
Of course I'm trying to pass.
Quickly now!

8
00:03:00,586 --> 00:03:02,286
If I knows anything sir,

9
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:04,917
you're Mr. Robert Packington, sir.

10
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:08,521
Member of Parliament and friend
of the lord Privy Seal,

11
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,022
aint that right sir?

12
00:03:10,906 --> 00:03:11,906
Yes,

13
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:13,349
on all counts.

14
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,861
I'll thank you again to step aside.

15
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:17,446
Aint you in a hurry sir?

16
00:03:18,012 --> 00:03:19,114
Yes I am.

17
00:03:19,786 --> 00:03:20,658
No need.

18
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,018
This one in a hurry eh!

19
00:03:34,952 --> 00:03:37,334
- Have they caught the villain?
- No, Milord.

20
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:39,402
He ran off into Cheapside.

21
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:42,704
The sergeant of arms has
his men all over the area.

22
00:03:43,147 --> 00:03:44,847
Pray God they catch him!

23
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:48,417
But I am sure Mr. Packington was

24
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:50,521
in every way an innocent victim.

25
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:53,711
Then why was he killed?

26
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,317
I presume to send a message to me.

27
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:58,971
I am not short of enemies,
Mr Risley.

28
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:01,281
There is nothing more difficult
to carry out

29
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:03,856
than to initiate
a new order of things

30
00:04:05,156 --> 00:04:08,406
Then you think bishop Gardiner
might be behind this...

31
00:04:09,597 --> 00:04:11,047
Or my Lord Suffolk?

32
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,150
I don't speculate.

33
00:04:19,898 --> 00:04:23,275
What I will say,
that there are dark forces at work

34
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,800
both inside and outside the court,
they must be defeated.

35
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:31,565
We must careful not to act til
we're completely sure who they are,

36
00:04:31,832 --> 00:04:33,282
and what they want.

37
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:37,109
In the meantime we must set to work,
finding a new bride for the King.

38
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:42,451
It's true that he has an heir at last
but... one is scarcely sufficient.

39
00:04:42,973 --> 00:04:45,223
To be safe he must produce another.

40
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:48,203
How is the King?

41
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:53,771
He's shut himself away.

42
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,719
So sad with grief,
that he's all broken

43
00:04:57,533 --> 00:04:59,283
and have none attend him

44
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,034
but only one.

45
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:04,191
Who is that?

46
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,195
Majesty.

47
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:40,762
What do you think?

48
00:05:42,773 --> 00:05:43,973
I don't think.

49
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:46,522
Are you mad? Thinking is dangerous.

50
00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:52,378
But I'll wink.

51
00:05:57,861 --> 00:05:58,861
Idiot.

52
00:05:59,763 --> 00:06:00,763
What?

53
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,611
What about you!

54
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:07,091
Think about it...
You find the perfect wife.

55
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:08,956
She's sweet...

56
00:06:09,856 --> 00:06:10,856
Pliable...

57
00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:13,182
she even has good tits!

58
00:06:13,876 --> 00:06:16,731
On top of that she gives you
the son you've always wanted,

59
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:18,356
and you let her die!

60
00:06:19,423 --> 00:06:22,523
Jesus Christ of mercy!
And you think I'm the idiot?

61
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:25,619
And she's not the only one...

62
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:27,265
Poor...

63
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,570
- abandoned Catherine.
- Careful.

64
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:33,087
And that other one...
who's name escapes me

65
00:06:34,197 --> 00:06:36,527
as her head escaped her.

66
00:06:37,094 --> 00:06:38,965
All lost! All lost!

67
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:40,531
Go to hell!

68
00:06:41,604 --> 00:06:42,604
Go there?

69
00:06:43,148 --> 00:06:45,148
I thought I'd already arrived!

70
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:48,952
For surely gracious lord, this is

71
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:51,466
hell.

72
00:06:58,105 --> 00:06:59,105
Poor lad,

73
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:01,670
never to know his own mother.

74
00:07:03,027 --> 00:07:04,027
No.

75
00:07:04,787 --> 00:07:07,051
He will know her.
Through me.

76
00:07:08,893 --> 00:07:11,543
Through others
who knew her gentle kindness

77
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,947
We shall all keep her memory so green,
he will think it always spring.

78
00:07:17,732 --> 00:07:21,182
And she still so young and fair
when he hears talk of her.

79
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:28,045
My Lady's household
is now to be dissolved.

80
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:33,572
The King himself seems very grieved
by her death but he has commanded...

81
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:35,452
that no effort be spared

82
00:07:35,577 --> 00:07:38,327
to protect this precious jewel,
his only son

83
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:42,061
A new household is to be
established for him at Hampton Court,

84
00:07:42,186 --> 00:07:43,634
and I am to head it,

85
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,632
responsible all together
for his nurture and education

86
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:51,922
I can think of no-one
who can be trusted more, Lady Bryan.

87
00:07:54,395 --> 00:07:58,242
Perhaps someday soon God willing,
Lady Mary, you yourself will have child.

88
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,355
I hear some rumour
of a Spanish Prince.

89
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,640
Yes, but there is nothing definite.

90
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:08,803
And in the meantime
I shall return to Hunson,

91
00:08:08,928 --> 00:08:12,321
and live quietly in the countryside
like an English gentlewoman.

92
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:14,868
Except I shall take the
Lady Elisabeth with me.

93
00:08:16,061 --> 00:08:18,664
And knowing that young lady,
you shall no quiet at all.

94
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:20,719
I don't mind.

95
00:08:22,596 --> 00:08:24,939
She and my brother Edward are...

96
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:26,768
excepting the King,

97
00:08:27,616 --> 00:08:28,866
my only family.

98
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,908
And I shall love them all.

99
00:08:36,147 --> 00:08:37,797
Oh, I have forgotten...

100
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:40,733
How is your son, Sir Francis?

101
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:43,564
Has he not gone away for the King?

102
00:08:44,246 --> 00:08:45,496
He has, milady.

103
00:08:46,073 --> 00:08:48,455
But alas I have no news of him.

104
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,611
Sir Francis, I came especially to
welcome you to Caserta.

105
00:09:21,736 --> 00:09:22,736
Leave!

106
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:36,675
May I see your letters of passage?

107
00:10:00,115 --> 00:10:02,265
These are letters of introduction

108
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,090
to the Prince of Naples.

109
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:09,483
You don't trust me?

110
00:10:10,323 --> 00:10:12,223
I need to see those letters.

111
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:19,029
And I need to see Cardinal Pole.

112
00:10:19,573 --> 00:10:22,923
Do you really suppose
you can threaten me, Sir Francis?

113
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,426
La porte est bloquée!

114
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:32,447
Ouvrez! Ouvrez cette porte!
- Ouvrez cette porte

115
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:35,513
You want to protect a traitor?
I want to know where he is!

116
00:10:35,638 --> 00:10:37,388
You are going to tell me,

117
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,045
or god help me, I'll kill you,

118
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:42,567
and I have the immunity to do it.

119
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:45,277
So, is he here.....?

120
00:10:46,297 --> 00:10:49,257
Is... he... Here?

121
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:51,066
Where is he?

122
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:08,414
It's called Nonesuch Palace.

123
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:10,249
Why?

124
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:12,517
Because it doesn't exist?

125
00:11:15,204 --> 00:11:16,204
No.

126
00:11:17,238 --> 00:11:19,388
Because there's no place like it.

127
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:22,312
But it doesn't exist.

128
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:24,143
I'll build it.

129
00:11:24,682 --> 00:11:27,394
Then you will have built
an imaginary palace,

130
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,119
and you will imaginary
people to fill it.

131
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,340
Are there not lots of those!

132
00:11:39,258 --> 00:11:40,308
I think so.

133
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,360
For you are one, and I another,

134
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:46,007
and the whole court is imaginary

135
00:11:46,132 --> 00:11:47,686
and all this is...

136
00:11:47,811 --> 00:11:48,811
a dream.

137
00:12:01,617 --> 00:12:02,917
It's all I have.

138
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:17,939
Dream on.

139
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,607
- Good night, Cardinal Pole.
- Wait.

140
00:12:40,937 --> 00:12:41,885
Wait.

141
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,830
I've grown afraid of my own shadow.

142
00:12:58,376 --> 00:12:59,736
The papal seal.

143
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:02,412
The holy father blessed it himself.

144
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:07,354
I feel safe when I have it.

145
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:15,503
- Will you sleep outside the door?
- Yes, your Eminence.

146
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:21,011
- Good night then.
- Good night, Eminence.

147
00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:45,955
Don't move...

148
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:51,599
Traitor!

149
00:14:03,647 --> 00:14:04,697
He got away

150
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,168
Sweetheart?

151
00:14:33,556 --> 00:14:35,456
Is something wrong with you?

152
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:37,414
Yes.

153
00:14:41,003 --> 00:14:42,003
No.

154
00:14:43,788 --> 00:14:47,046
But sometimes I think that
I do not want this child in my belly.

155
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:49,329
Oh my love, why would you say so?

156
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:54,285
I will always be haunted
by the ghosts of other children.

157
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:56,645
Murdered children,

158
00:14:59,056 --> 00:15:02,863
unwanted, unloved
for the bloody memories it'd provoke.

159
00:15:06,187 --> 00:15:08,887
Better it was gone before
it was ever born.

160
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:43,036
I have other ideas for the palace.

161
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:45,568
I'll construct beautiful gardens

162
00:15:45,698 --> 00:15:48,113
full of groves, hidden dells,
paths...

163
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,873
There'll be a grove of Diana

164
00:15:50,998 --> 00:15:53,098
showing the goddess in her bath.

165
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,350
Statues everywhere,
fountains, spouting water,

166
00:15:57,434 --> 00:15:59,479
plus marble birds

167
00:15:59,932 --> 00:16:02,132
pour forth water from their bills.

168
00:16:07,694 --> 00:16:09,395
What do you say... fool?

169
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:13,688
I like it all,
I like everything about it.

170
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:16,401
Except the groves.

171
00:16:16,781 --> 00:16:18,481
I don't like the groves.

172
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:21,708
Or the fountains, or the paths,

173
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:23,917
or the marble birds.

174
00:16:25,241 --> 00:16:26,891
Everything else I like!

175
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:28,997
You don't understand.

176
00:16:30,464 --> 00:16:31,756
The French King,

177
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:35,022
Has a palace at Chambord
which is the envy of all the world.

178
00:16:35,147 --> 00:16:36,247
But Nonesuch

179
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:39,461
will trump it a hundred,
a thousand times.

180
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:41,093
Then...

181
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,933
in time...

182
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:45,795
like everything else
it will dissolve away.

183
00:16:46,938 --> 00:16:48,988
Like the ruins of ancient Rome,

184
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,030
the Colossus of Rhodes...

185
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,128
all thing tend towards their ruin,

186
00:16:55,175 --> 00:16:58,075
<i>even great houses and</i>
<i>the fools who build them.</i>

187
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,223
<i>And so in a little space,</i>

188
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:06,024
there will indeed be Nonesuch Palace,
but it will all be gone.

189
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:08,347
<i>A vacancy,</i>

190
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,125
<i>a nullity,</i>

191
00:17:10,785 --> 00:17:13,446
a green fort in a green shade.

192
00:17:15,572 --> 00:17:16,572
And yet...

193
00:17:17,658 --> 00:17:19,058
People will see...

194
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:22,052
There once existed
a great palace there.

195
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:24,625
A palace beyond beauty.

196
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:27,025
A palace beyond compare.

197
00:17:28,692 --> 00:17:30,392
And King Henry built it.

198
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,670
And it will all still exist.

199
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:36,818
True, true.

200
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:40,595
The only things which exist
are in people's heads,

201
00:17:41,892 --> 00:17:44,498
and...
you never found a head so fine

202
00:17:44,623 --> 00:17:46,373
but you could make it fly

203
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:55,924
Your turn.

204
00:18:08,241 --> 00:18:10,473
- Don't play the fool.
- Why not?

205
00:18:11,543 --> 00:18:13,594
- You'll lose the game.
- Indeed.

206
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:17,558
But I'd much rather lose game
than lose my head.

207
00:18:24,068 --> 00:18:24,878
Fool.

208
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:50,883
Gawen!

209
00:18:51,152 --> 00:18:52,213
You're up late.

210
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,989
Is your master Seymour, alone?

211
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:57,431
What are you scared of?

212
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:01,282
Poor Gawen!

213
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:05,869
Who is he?

214
00:19:07,348 --> 00:19:08,548
Sir Gawen Carew.

215
00:19:09,135 --> 00:19:11,046
One of Lord Seymour's retainers.

216
00:19:13,757 --> 00:19:15,075
Why was he killed?

217
00:19:17,684 --> 00:19:20,126
May have been for a
gambling debt, My Lord.

218
00:19:20,586 --> 00:19:21,702
May have been?

219
00:19:22,717 --> 00:19:23,999
We are investigating.

220
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,696
You have not found the killer?

221
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:31,746
No, My lord. Although is seems possible
it was one of Lord Suffolk's retainers.

222
00:19:34,553 --> 00:19:37,321
It's illegal to carry arms in court
while the King's in residence.

223
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:39,341
The penalties are severe.

224
00:19:39,648 --> 00:19:40,637
Yes My Lord.

225
00:19:41,384 --> 00:19:43,976
Now my friend Mister Packington?
Have you not found his killer?

226
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:45,469
No, Milord.

227
00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:46,510
No?

228
00:19:47,742 --> 00:19:50,963
It seems to me, sergeant, that as the
man appointed to keep order in court,

229
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,122
you are singularly
failing in your duties.

230
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:55,037
I trust you will now apprehend
the villain,

231
00:19:55,157 --> 00:19:56,604
and prevent violence,

232
00:19:56,724 --> 00:19:59,743
otherwise, you will pay
the price for your failures

233
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,165
It's in order. You may take
Sir Francis through, Lady Bryan.

234
00:20:15,285 --> 00:20:17,309
Thank you. This way, Francis.

235
00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:18,492
Mama...

236
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:23,234
What's this?

237
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,604
The King's given orders personally

238
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,517
that all the rooms and cambers and
passages around the Prince's apartment

239
00:20:29,637 --> 00:20:32,356
are to be scrubbed with soap,
three times daily.

240
00:20:32,476 --> 00:20:35,390
The Prince also has his own kitchen
where all his meals are prepared

241
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,534
Now that he's weaned
from mother jack.

242
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,786
Everything that he might touch
is to be washed,

243
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,763
and everything he might eat,
tasted for poison.

244
00:20:43,265 --> 00:20:46,148
His personal chamberlain
supervises his meals, his robes,

245
00:20:46,268 --> 00:20:47,468
and daily bath.

246
00:20:48,338 --> 00:20:50,415
He must be the cleanest baby
in England.

247
00:20:50,627 --> 00:20:52,713
He is the most precious
baby in England.

248
00:21:28,363 --> 00:21:29,368
My Lord!

249
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:31,351
Thank you, Lady Bryan.

250
00:21:42,392 --> 00:21:43,639
Why have you come here?

251
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,012
Has the King banished
you to the nursery

252
00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:48,671
for letting Cardinal Pole
slip through your fingers?

253
00:21:50,546 --> 00:21:51,565
His Majesty

254
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,811
anxious to assure himself

255
00:21:54,327 --> 00:21:55,943
of his son's wellbeing.

256
00:21:56,355 --> 00:21:58,253
He has no need to be concerned.

257
00:21:58,699 --> 00:22:01,294
The protection of the Prince
is also my first priority

258
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:03,401
since he is also of my blood.

259
00:22:04,685 --> 00:22:08,372
I thank you, Sir Francis,
in future to leave my nephew alone.

260
00:22:09,714 --> 00:22:11,221
And my wife too.

261
00:22:12,728 --> 00:22:14,221
Do I make myself clear?

262
00:22:25,765 --> 00:22:27,034
The Lord Chancellor.

263
00:22:28,842 --> 00:22:30,265
Please take a seat.

264
00:22:31,532 --> 00:22:34,052
There is something new
I should like to discuss with you.

265
00:22:34,172 --> 00:22:37,421
You know that the King has seen fit to
start remodeling most of his palaces.

266
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,424
Including the enlargement
of Hampton Court.

267
00:22:39,544 --> 00:22:42,731
My Lord, I have already
released funds for the project.

268
00:22:43,191 --> 00:22:46,105
And also for the construction
of St James' Palace.

269
00:22:46,225 --> 00:22:47,036
Well.

270
00:22:48,665 --> 00:22:49,788
There's a new one.

271
00:23:05,398 --> 00:23:06,945
This is a fantasy work!

272
00:23:08,075 --> 00:23:09,766
It will cost a fortune.

273
00:23:11,914 --> 00:23:14,040
As a result of the dissolution of
the monasteries

274
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,223
His Majesty has gained a large fortune.

275
00:23:16,448 --> 00:23:19,171
Yes, but did you ever suppose
it would be squandered on...

276
00:23:19,436 --> 00:23:20,524
fantasies?

277
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:22,154
Can you not...

278
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:25,774
- Talk to him?
- Richie...

279
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,151
what King wills the King must have

280
00:23:30,532 --> 00:23:32,050
he's not to argued with or crossed.

281
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,509
He's still mourning the death
of his beloved wife.

282
00:23:35,785 --> 00:23:38,059
And he will talk to no-one
but Will Somers.

283
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:39,512
Will Somers?

284
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:42,261
His fool?

285
00:23:44,002 --> 00:23:46,997
- He will talk to no-one but his fool?
- It's not the first time.

286
00:23:48,211 --> 00:23:49,514
In extremes, always.

287
00:23:52,174 --> 00:23:54,211
- For how long?
- I don't know.

288
00:23:56,326 --> 00:23:58,489
I wish he would come out,
without him...

289
00:23:59,717 --> 00:24:01,070
we're all gone to hell.

290
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,943
Mad fool, fool there's something
else we have to decide.

291
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:14,448
We have to decide

292
00:24:14,908 --> 00:24:17,895
which articles of faith and
which commandments are best.

293
00:24:18,453 --> 00:24:20,922
For our new church, our people

294
00:24:21,871 --> 00:24:22,918
so they can

295
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,466
walk in good ways.

296
00:24:27,612 --> 00:24:29,202
"Thou shall not"... what?

297
00:24:29,746 --> 00:24:30,926
Play the fool?

298
00:24:31,046 --> 00:24:32,736
"Cover thy neighbor's wife."

299
00:24:32,856 --> 00:24:34,856
Unless she's very pretty.

300
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:36,968
"Or his...

301
00:24:37,247 --> 00:24:39,638
man servant...
maid servant,

302
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,840
Ox, ass"...

303
00:24:42,017 --> 00:24:44,530
or your neighbor's wife's ass?

304
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:55,747
Don't be facetious, buffoon.

305
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,025
Did you know... Did you know...

306
00:25:05,535 --> 00:25:06,749
that in Exodus,

307
00:25:07,294 --> 00:25:09,652
there are 613 commandments?

308
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:15,058
"Thou shalt not suffer a witch."
To live..."

309
00:25:16,594 --> 00:25:18,078
Thou shalt have

310
00:25:18,198 --> 00:25:19,761
three feast days

311
00:25:20,082 --> 00:25:21,380
unto me a year".

312
00:25:21,657 --> 00:25:24,927
"Thou shalt never vex...
stranger".

313
00:25:25,426 --> 00:25:29,396
"Whosoever lies with a beast, shall
be surely put to death".

314
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:31,643
Sheep shaggers.

315
00:25:32,285 --> 00:25:33,515
Pigeon fanciers.

316
00:25:40,648 --> 00:25:43,983
Thou shall not venerate
the vicar of Rome.

317
00:25:44,737 --> 00:25:46,225
Or lick his ares.

318
00:25:54,426 --> 00:25:56,141
For thine is the kingdom.

319
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:57,893
The power and the glory.

320
00:26:00,188 --> 00:26:00,998
Amen.

321
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:03,356
That's the doxology!

322
00:26:05,484 --> 00:26:06,684
The doxology?

323
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:11,505
It's the dog's bloody bullocks.

324
00:26:25,245 --> 00:26:26,571
I miss her, Will...

325
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:31,845
I miss her so much...

326
00:26:34,901 --> 00:26:35,794
I know.

327
00:26:37,587 --> 00:26:39,481
But this too shall pass.

328
00:26:43,648 --> 00:26:46,690
Why go on dwelling in darkness?

329
00:26:49,998 --> 00:26:52,657
You know that the land
of the wounded King...

330
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,091
is only a parched wasteland,

331
00:26:55,706 --> 00:26:58,706
thirsting for rain
and your Majesty's grace.

332
00:27:30,725 --> 00:27:32,694
Sir... there's a fight.

333
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,270
You'd best come quick.

334
00:27:54,198 --> 00:27:56,036
Whoever you are.
Hold!

335
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:00,041
Put up your swords in the name of
the King! You are committing treason!

336
00:28:00,697 --> 00:28:01,625
You sir!

337
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:03,578
Give up your sword!

338
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,152
I say on pain of death!
Give them up.

339
00:28:09,947 --> 00:28:12,672
You heard the sergeant?
Give me your sword.

340
00:28:17,337 --> 00:28:18,241
Very well.

341
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:37,898
Go.

342
00:28:38,443 --> 00:28:39,350
Go, now!

343
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,605
Go!

344
00:29:36,178 --> 00:29:37,973
While the King's indisposed,

345
00:29:38,093 --> 00:29:40,875
no-one has the authority
to make decisions on his behalf

346
00:29:40,995 --> 00:29:44,136
The Prince, my nephew,
is in my custody.

347
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:47,997
And no-one is or will be allowed
to see him, without my written approval

348
00:29:48,207 --> 00:29:51,016
He is the King's son
and the property of the state,

349
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:53,137
He is not your property, Mister.

350
00:29:53,788 --> 00:29:55,383
The Lord Privy Seal.

351
00:29:56,514 --> 00:29:57,546
My Lords.

352
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,932
Your Grace.

353
00:30:03,918 --> 00:30:06,359
I beg you all can we not
now come to order?

354
00:30:06,479 --> 00:30:09,267
By what right and by who's command,
Mister Secretary,

355
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:11,137
do you summon the King's council?

356
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,769
My Lord Hussey, as you well know,

357
00:30:13,889 --> 00:30:15,804
the King is incommunicado...

358
00:30:15,924 --> 00:30:18,653
Then your only authority to
put yourself above others

359
00:30:18,876 --> 00:30:20,416
is a usurped one.

360
00:30:20,536 --> 00:30:24,088
As Lord Privy Seal I think I have
the right and the responsibly

361
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:27,641
in loco parentis, of summoning
your Lordships to council.

362
00:30:28,422 --> 00:30:29,581
Gentlemen...

363
00:30:29,824 --> 00:30:30,798
Gentlemen.

364
00:30:31,682 --> 00:30:34,066
Surely you can see there must
be a meeting of council:

365
00:30:34,186 --> 00:30:37,338
In King's absent,there has been much
malevolence and violence at court,

366
00:30:37,498 --> 00:30:39,783
including now, the death
of the Sergeant at arms.

367
00:30:39,903 --> 00:30:42,497
I've heard that your own servants
were much involved in the violence,

368
00:30:42,617 --> 00:30:43,896
Mister secretary.

369
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,290
Some say that they may
have even provoked it.

370
00:30:53,762 --> 00:30:55,302
If that could be proved,

371
00:30:55,422 --> 00:30:57,529
I should rightly forfeit
your Lordships trust.

372
00:30:57,878 --> 00:31:00,098
But I can assure your Grace
it is not true,

373
00:31:00,218 --> 00:31:02,614
and others should
look to their own conscience.

374
00:31:08,078 --> 00:31:09,514
What do you mean by that?

375
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,912
There are some that desire
disorder with all their heart

376
00:31:12,032 --> 00:31:14,000
thinking to use it the end
to their own advantage.

377
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,337
Mister Cromwell, you presume
too far above

378
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,505
very base and low degree.

379
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:22,337
Until the King is well, you will
not summon me to anymore to anything.

380
00:31:25,588 --> 00:31:26,888
Not even to a dog fight!

381
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,757
For God's sake,
have you any new of the King?

382
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:56,375
Yes, he's rewriting
the Lord's Prayer, and...

383
00:31:57,459 --> 00:31:58,884
The ten Commandments.

384
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:00,921
- What?
- Certainly.

385
00:32:12,852 --> 00:32:15,336
- How are the prawns?
- Delicious.

386
00:32:17,832 --> 00:32:20,661
I've warned Sir Francis Bryan
to stay away from you.

387
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:22,935
Why?

388
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:24,833
He's dangerous.

389
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:28,538
Not to you surely?
Not with the boy.

390
00:32:28,925 --> 00:32:30,488
The King listens to him.

391
00:32:31,046 --> 00:32:33,223
That makes him
dangerous to everyone.

392
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:36,874
I shall have to destroy him.

393
00:32:39,018 --> 00:32:40,065
It's a pity.

394
00:32:41,034 --> 00:32:42,332
He makes me laugh.

395
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:45,586
I'm sure he makes
a lot of women laugh.

396
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,530
It's a very small thing to you
isn't It,

397
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:51,639
Edward...

398
00:32:53,635 --> 00:32:55,890
I think there are more
important things; yes.

399
00:32:59,365 --> 00:33:00,900
No doubt you're right.

400
00:33:04,454 --> 00:33:06,003
But as long as you do...

401
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,282
don't expect me to
be faithful to you.

402
00:34:49,857 --> 00:34:51,757
May I have some more prawns?

403
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,091
Wakey, wakey!

404
00:35:22,034 --> 00:35:24,234
His Majesty would like to see you,

405
00:35:26,688 --> 00:35:27,938
at once.

406
00:35:57,466 --> 00:35:58,766
Master Cromwell.

407
00:35:59,348 --> 00:36:00,348
Majesty.

408
00:36:02,224 --> 00:36:03,867
How goes the world?

409
00:36:04,592 --> 00:36:07,077
The King of France has
written to your Majesty

410
00:36:07,202 --> 00:36:09,952
to congratulate you
on the birth of your son.

411
00:36:14,448 --> 00:36:16,458
Tell Frances...

412
00:36:16,813 --> 00:36:20,763
Divine Providence has mingled
my joy with the bitterness of death...

413
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,512
of her who bought me such...

414
00:36:25,261 --> 00:36:26,261
happiness.

415
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:36,779
Tell bishop Gardener
I wish to see him.

416
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:40,341
- I wish to talk to him.
- Well of course, your Majesty.

417
00:36:41,751 --> 00:36:42,951
How is my son?

418
00:36:43,343 --> 00:36:45,433
Everything's been done
to protect the Prince,

419
00:36:45,558 --> 00:36:48,536
in strict accordance
with your Majesty's instructions.

420
00:36:50,613 --> 00:36:51,913
I love that boy.

421
00:36:53,259 --> 00:36:55,668
If anything should ever
happen to him...

422
00:36:59,497 --> 00:37:01,220
Majesty, I wonder...

423
00:37:01,384 --> 00:37:02,384
Wonder?

424
00:37:03,983 --> 00:37:05,030
Tell me...

425
00:37:05,955 --> 00:37:08,598
what do you wonder, Mister Cromwell?

426
00:37:11,753 --> 00:37:14,938
I wonder if your Majesty could frame
your mind towards a new marriage.

427
00:37:16,825 --> 00:37:18,049
After all...

428
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:21,288
however much is done
to protect the Prince...

429
00:37:31,811 --> 00:37:34,815
Let me free my mind... why not?

430
00:37:37,238 --> 00:37:39,040
What do you suggest?

431
00:37:39,385 --> 00:37:41,687
I took the liberty of instructing
our ambassadors

432
00:37:41,812 --> 00:37:45,811
in France and the Low Countries
to begin making enquiries.

433
00:37:47,978 --> 00:37:48,978
And?

434
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:53,838
The French have proposed two
possible consorts for your Majesty.

435
00:37:54,006 --> 00:37:55,810
Marguerite,
the daughter of the King,

436
00:37:55,935 --> 00:37:58,922
and Marie, the daughter
of the Duke De Guise.

437
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:01,521
Our ambassador to France
sings the latter's praises,

438
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:05,396
though it seems... she is half promised
to the King of Scotland.

439
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:17,009
Majesty?

440
00:38:26,064 --> 00:38:27,364
How is the King?

441
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:30,859
He has just lately emerged
from his seclusion.

442
00:38:32,606 --> 00:38:36,167
It is said that although he is
little disposed to it...

443
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,840
the council is urging him to take
the extreme step of marrying again.

444
00:38:41,373 --> 00:38:42,573
A marriage?

445
00:38:47,864 --> 00:38:51,514
I don't suppose heard any more
about Don Luis and my marriage?

446
00:38:53,055 --> 00:38:56,331
As to that, Lady Mary, I'm afraid
I have no news for you,

447
00:38:57,104 --> 00:38:58,554
wether good or bad.

448
00:38:59,485 --> 00:39:02,255
It seems perhaps the issue
is in abeyance

449
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,280
at least for the time being.

450
00:39:05,326 --> 00:39:08,776
- Perhaps it is my fate never to marry.
- No, gentle lady.

451
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:10,681
No.

452
00:39:10,924 --> 00:39:13,463
I'm sure the King
will make up his mind to...

453
00:39:13,588 --> 00:39:16,184
to arrange an most brilliant
marriage for you.

454
00:39:16,513 --> 00:39:19,813
If not to Don Luis,
then to someone even more eligible.

455
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:23,232
I thought you said
Don Luis was incomparable.

456
00:39:23,681 --> 00:39:26,444
- Madame, I did not mean...
- No. You meant well

457
00:39:27,279 --> 00:39:28,829
You always mean well.

458
00:39:33,111 --> 00:39:36,061
Jane's household is now
all broken up.

459
00:39:36,205 --> 00:39:39,883
- Where will you go, Lady Misseldon?
- To live with my mother.

460
00:39:40,008 --> 00:39:42,418
What about the young man
you were engaged to?

461
00:39:42,876 --> 00:39:44,226
Robert Tavistock?

462
00:39:45,018 --> 00:39:47,468
I think he is not
so interested in me.

463
00:39:47,737 --> 00:39:49,337
He is a fool then.

464
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:52,513
You're kind to think so,
Sir Francis.

465
00:39:52,638 --> 00:39:55,027
Is he so foolish that he'll
turn down a peerage,

466
00:39:55,152 --> 00:39:59,156
and a gift of one of the dissolved
abbeys... if he agrees to marry you?

467
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,331
Majesty, I would think less of him
if he needed to accept

468
00:40:03,456 --> 00:40:05,506
such gifts in order to love me.

469
00:40:07,704 --> 00:40:10,943
Your Majesty has been more
than generous and gracious,

470
00:40:11,068 --> 00:40:13,309
but I'm settled in a plan
to go home,

471
00:40:13,434 --> 00:40:15,384
to see what has become of me.

472
00:40:16,844 --> 00:40:18,716
In my present state of mind...

473
00:40:18,841 --> 00:40:21,124
you could not have said
a more admirable thing.

474
00:40:23,363 --> 00:40:25,963
You may leave
with our love and blessing.

475
00:40:31,569 --> 00:40:32,819
One more night.

476
00:40:58,984 --> 00:41:00,984
The traitor Pole, escaped you.

477
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:02,123
Yes.

478
00:41:02,563 --> 00:41:06,563
We've other agents looking for him.
But he was smuggled out to Italy.

479
00:41:06,806 --> 00:41:09,660
No doubt he's sitting
on the Pope's lap even now.

480
00:41:09,785 --> 00:41:11,340
His betrayal hurts me.

481
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:15,498
Pity it is...
that the folly of one brain-sick Pole,

482
00:41:15,638 --> 00:41:19,015
or to save that one witless fool,
should be the ruin of so great a family.

483
00:41:23,032 --> 00:41:25,010
That(***) I cannot touch you...

484
00:41:25,135 --> 00:41:28,235
I swear I will make him
eat his heart.

485
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,548
The holy father mentioned
you in his prayers today

486
00:41:43,964 --> 00:41:46,564
He thanked God
for your safe deliverance.

487
00:41:46,964 --> 00:41:48,964
I was sure I was going to die.

488
00:41:50,992 --> 00:41:53,042
Death is not ready for you yet.

489
00:41:55,338 --> 00:41:57,388
God has something else in mind.

490
00:41:59,338 --> 00:42:02,741
How else to explain the
miracle of your survival?

491
00:42:13,377 --> 00:42:16,677
My brother, Lord Montague,
has sent me a letter.

492
00:42:18,638 --> 00:42:19,638
Show me.

493
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:32,496
"I send you God's blessing...

494
00:42:32,701 --> 00:42:35,555
"and mine, although my trust
to have comfort in you...

495
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,330
"has turned to sorrow.

496
00:42:38,038 --> 00:42:40,965
"It is incredible to me
that by reason of a brief

497
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,224
"sent to you by the bishop of Rome,

498
00:42:43,393 --> 00:42:46,393
"you should be resident
with him for this winter.

499
00:42:46,626 --> 00:42:50,045
"If you keep that way
then farewell all my hope!

500
00:42:50,454 --> 00:42:53,990
"And God save your mother
and all your family."

501
00:42:58,844 --> 00:43:00,144
What should I do?

502
00:43:14,818 --> 00:43:17,359
That letter was not
written by your brother,

503
00:43:17,484 --> 00:43:19,584
but dictated to him by Cromwell,

504
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,990
the messenger of Satan.

505
00:43:28,664 --> 00:43:30,559
Never let the Devil beguile you,

506
00:43:30,684 --> 00:43:33,234
either with his threats
or his promises.

507
00:43:34,259 --> 00:43:37,077
The price of your soul
is eternal vigilance.

508
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:39,225
If you once let down your guard,

509
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:42,450
the Devil will slip like a serpent
into your mouth.

510
00:43:43,249 --> 00:43:46,049
And forever afterwards
he will speak for you.

511
00:43:50,316 --> 00:43:53,677
<i>My lord bishop... you and your committee
were asked to examine,</i>

512
00:43:53,802 --> 00:43:55,838
<i>and determine the doctrine
of the church of England.</i>

513
00:43:56,246 --> 00:43:58,549
But you seem unable
to agree on anything

514
00:43:59,277 --> 00:44:00,527
Your Majesty,

515
00:44:01,214 --> 00:44:03,114
there continue to be some...

516
00:44:03,673 --> 00:44:07,677
fundamental theological differences
between members of the committee.

517
00:44:07,802 --> 00:44:08,975
I'm aware of that.

518
00:44:09,509 --> 00:44:11,314
But I've grown very impatient,

519
00:44:11,439 --> 00:44:14,139
and I will not tolerate
any more divisions.

520
00:44:14,645 --> 00:44:16,142
I have formulated...

521
00:44:16,267 --> 00:44:19,353
six fundamental doctrinal questions.

522
00:44:20,753 --> 00:44:24,033
The answers to these questions
will form the basis of our faith.

523
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:27,299
Of course.

524
00:44:27,763 --> 00:44:29,413
As Your Majesty wishes.

525
00:44:30,477 --> 00:44:34,168
I shall go at once to Canterbury
and consult with the Archbishop.

526
00:44:34,346 --> 00:44:35,346
My lord...

527
00:44:36,576 --> 00:44:38,376
save yourself the journey.

528
00:44:39,383 --> 00:44:42,083
I think we understand each other
very well.

529
00:44:42,706 --> 00:44:45,956
Let's leave archbishop Cranmer
to tend his own garden.

530
00:44:46,252 --> 00:44:48,652
There's really no need
to bother him.

531
00:44:49,202 --> 00:44:50,476
Don't you agree?

532
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,520
Your Majesty,
here are the six Articles of faith,

533
00:45:06,645 --> 00:45:09,345
upon which Your Majesty's
Church of England

534
00:45:09,538 --> 00:45:12,138
- is to built, and sustained.
- Read them.

535
00:45:13,103 --> 00:45:15,401
The first Article concerns the truth

536
00:45:15,526 --> 00:45:17,999
of the Transubstantiation of God.

537
00:45:18,606 --> 00:45:22,106
By the consecration of the bread
and the wine at holy mass,

538
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:26,092
<i>there takes place a change
in the whole substance of the bread</i>

539
00:45:26,547 --> 00:45:29,589
<i>into the substance
of the body of Christ our Lord,</i>

540
00:45:29,739 --> 00:45:33,037
<i>and change in substance of the wine,</i>

541
00:45:33,162 --> 00:45:35,262
<i>into the substance of his blood.</i>

542
00:45:36,023 --> 00:45:38,973
<i>The penalty for denying this
is death by burning</i>

543
00:45:39,983 --> 00:45:41,633
even after recantation.

544
00:45:43,621 --> 00:45:45,613
The second Article concerns

545
00:45:46,186 --> 00:45:50,189
<i>the withholding of the cup
from the laity, during communion.</i>

546
00:45:51,563 --> 00:45:53,676
<i>For if we offer them
the blood of Christ,</i>

547
00:45:53,801 --> 00:45:57,301
<i>they will lose all their reverence
for the holy sacraments,</i>

548
00:45:57,667 --> 00:46:00,567
<i>and the power of the blood
will be washed away.</i>

549
00:46:01,178 --> 00:46:04,302
<i>Quam oblationem quaesumus tu Deus</i>

550
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:08,511
<i>ut nobis corpus et sanguinis fiat</i>

551
00:46:09,806 --> 00:46:12,140
<i>dilectissimi filii tui.</i>

552
00:46:17,097 --> 00:46:20,566
<i>The third Article prescribes the...</i>

553
00:46:20,988 --> 00:46:24,953
<i>continued validity
of the vows of celibacy for all...</i>

554
00:46:25,569 --> 00:46:28,225
<i>priests and nuns.
For, does not Saint Paul say:</i>

555
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:30,075
<i>"He that is without a wife,</i>

556
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:35,042
<i>"is solicitous for things of the Lord,
how he may please God,</i>

557
00:46:35,536 --> 00:46:39,186
<i>"he who has a wife is solicitous
for the things of the world."</i>

558
00:46:41,693 --> 00:46:44,032
<i>All priests who are now married</i>

559
00:46:44,157 --> 00:46:46,412
<i>must now forthwith
desert their wives,</i>

560
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:49,390
<i>or face the penalty of death.</i>

561
00:46:59,175 --> 00:47:03,179
<i>The fourth Article concerns
the observation of the vows of chastity.</i>

562
00:47:04,069 --> 00:47:06,445
<i>A priest makes a vow of chastity,</i>

563
00:47:06,975 --> 00:47:10,866
<i>and any violation of that vow
must surely be a sin against religion.</i>

564
00:47:10,991 --> 00:47:13,221
<i>To turn aside a vow to God,</i>

565
00:47:13,644 --> 00:47:16,194
<i>and to writhe
in the pit of fornication,</i>

566
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:19,928
<i>is to follow the devil
willingly into the mouth of Hell.</i>

567
00:47:22,848 --> 00:47:24,347
<i>Accipite...</i>

568
00:47:24,632 --> 00:47:27,650
<i>et manducate ex hoc omnes.</i>

569
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:32,289
<i>Hoc est enim corpus meum.</i>

570
00:47:33,808 --> 00:47:36,333
<i>The fifth Article herein decided</i>

571
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:40,599
<i>is concerned with the continuation
of private masses</i>

572
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:43,666
<i>whereby, good Christian people,</i>

573
00:47:43,941 --> 00:47:47,942
<i>may receive both godly
and goodly consolation,</i>

574
00:47:48,067 --> 00:47:49,890
<i>and blessings for their souls.</i>

575
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,514
<i>Corpus Christi.</i>

576
00:47:52,233 --> 00:47:55,837
<i>The sixth Article confirms
the importance of confession.</i>

577
00:47:56,235 --> 00:48:00,051
<i>Confitemini alterutrum
peccata vestra.</i>

578
00:48:00,735 --> 00:48:03,258
<i>Confess your sins to one another.</i>

579
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:05,529
<i>Sanguinis Christi.</i>

580
00:48:08,046 --> 00:48:11,384
<i>Anyone who disputes
against these Articles,</i>

581
00:48:11,509 --> 00:48:13,659
must now be considered a heretic,

582
00:48:13,988 --> 00:48:17,955
like those extreme Lutherans
who now roam this land.

583
00:48:18,558 --> 00:48:21,040
<i>The punishment for transgression
is to be death</i>

584
00:48:21,165 --> 00:48:23,105
<i>by hanging, drawing, and quartering,</i>

585
00:48:23,482 --> 00:48:27,005
<i>as well as forfeiture
of estates and property.</i>

586
00:48:27,693 --> 00:48:29,001
<i>And any man...</i>

587
00:48:29,711 --> 00:48:33,578
<i>who decides to try to flee England
in the face of these new Articles,</i>

588
00:48:33,703 --> 00:48:36,076
<i>will be considered
to have committed treason</i>

589
00:48:36,201 --> 00:48:39,192
<i>and suffer accordingly
the awful fate</i>

590
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:41,442
<i>handed out to traitors.</i>

591
00:48:43,709 --> 00:48:45,459
Thank you my lord bishop.

592
00:49:00,441 --> 00:49:03,332
<i>You Eminences are to congratulated
on your hard work,</i>

593
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:04,813
<i>and manifest wisdom.</i>

594
00:49:05,064 --> 00:49:08,191
Here we have six Articles we may
adhere to with a clear conscience.

595
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:11,104
<i>There is one final amendment.</i>

596
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,040
Henceforth: the Lord's prayer will
be altered to include the doxology.

597
00:49:18,364 --> 00:49:21,185
"For thine is the Kingdom,
the power...

598
00:49:22,368 --> 00:49:23,812
"and the glory."

599
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:25,417
Amen.

600
00:49:26,556 --> 00:49:27,544
Amen.

601
00:49:30,303 --> 00:49:32,593
My Lords, Eminences, Your Grace...

602
00:49:34,689 --> 00:49:37,439
now that these matters
have been determined,

603
00:49:38,207 --> 00:49:40,757
let us prosecute
with absolute diligence

604
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:44,172
all those who stubbornly
stand against us.

605
00:49:58,045 --> 00:50:01,873
<i>These aren't six Articles...
they're a whip with six strings.</i>

606
00:50:02,525 --> 00:50:05,843
Cranmer ought to send his wife
and son back to Germany...

607
00:50:05,968 --> 00:50:07,125
or be burned.

608
00:50:08,557 --> 00:50:10,657
It's not just that, Mister Rich.

609
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:14,710
Private masses, confessions,
the blood and the body of Christ,

610
00:50:14,835 --> 00:50:16,413
these are Catholic measures.

611
00:50:16,538 --> 00:50:19,929
He's rolled back the reforms...
it's the end of our reformation.

612
00:50:20,314 --> 00:50:22,640
- Why?
- Because in his heart,

613
00:50:22,899 --> 00:50:25,180
he has always been a true Catholic.

614
00:50:26,647 --> 00:50:30,047
Excepting just one thing:
that he will have neither Pope,

615
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,068
nor Luther, nor any other man
set above him.
