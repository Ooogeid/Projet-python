Previously on The Tudors           

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,420
Your daughter Jane should come to court,as lady to Her Majesty.      

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,850
Imagine what it would mean for us if you did grow to love her.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,040
There are some at court who would like to see the Queen replaced 

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,880
Are you saying that I should be queen?               

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,810
I wish there was a way I could remove Mistress Seymour from among my ladies.       

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,580
When you have given the King his great desire,then you will

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,880
have all the power to deal with her as you like. 

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,430
I have a new desire to renew my friendship with the Emperor.     -

10
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,080
You will find out the cost of friendship.

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,150
The Emperor is prepared to offer the King his support.

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,740
But on condition that the King declares Princess Mary to be his legitimate heir.

13
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,230
There remains one great obstacle...  we must find a way around it.

14
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,110
-He's been seduced by witchcraft. I have always believed it.

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,160
-My God!  -That is why she must die.

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,010
-You have not forsaken my bed  for that of another woman, but for another man.

17
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,840
-Something is going to happen to me.

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,450
-It's alright. Everything is going to be alright.

19
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,970
-The King has fallen from his horse and as been crushed.

20
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,460
He is likely to die.

21
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,310
-Oh God!

22
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,140
-As I lay there, your image came to me. Will you let me kiss you,Jane?

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,730
-Oh my God! What is this? Just while my belly

24
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,980
is doing his business, I find you wenching with Mistress Seymour.

25
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,450
Ah! Ah no no no...

26
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,320
Oh! Ah! -You've lost my boy.

27
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,470
But I see now,that God will not grant me any male children.

28
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,490
-You have no one to blame but yourself for this.

29
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,500
-I made this marriage seduced by witchcraft.

30
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,340
And for that reason, consider to be null

31
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,860
and void,so now I believe,

32
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,290
that I will take another wife

33
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,340
-The child had the appearance of a male,

34
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,310
about four months old.

35
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,910
However...

36
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,280
The foetus...

37
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,750
there were signs of deformity.

38
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,220
Of abnormality.

39
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,290
Perhaps,after all,

40
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,460
the Queen's miscarriage

41
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,260
was a blessing in disguise.

42
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,550
Majesty.

43
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,800
-Madame. -Monsieur Ambassadeur...

44
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,670
I beg you: King Francis must be persuaded

45
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,710
to accept the marriage of his son to our daughter Elizabeth,

46
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,180
so that I may not be ruined or lost,

47
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,280
for I see myself very near that

48
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,150
and in more trouble and grief than I was ever in before my marriage...

49
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,120
I cannot speak to you more fully now,

50
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,960
nor dare I express my fears in writing. But please,

51
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,390
after everything I've done for France,

52
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,460
as you love me,do the best you can for me,

53
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,070
for God's sake.

54
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,570
-Mr. Edward Seymour.

55
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,480
-Master Seymour. -Mr. Secretary.

56
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,220
-We don't know each  other well.

57
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,220
But we shall. I have every confidence.

58
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,360
It is His Majesty's pleasure

59
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,790
to appoint you a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber.

60
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,330
In that capacity,you will attend His Majesty daily,

61
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,060
and as he sees fit to use you.  It is,you will understand that,

62
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,030
a special and privileged position.

63
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,140
-I do understand.

64
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,200
And I am deeply honored, Mr. Secretary.

65
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,840
-There is... one more thing.

66
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,720
His Majesty has indicated to me

67
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,650
he would like to pay court to your sister,from time to time,

68
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,490
although to avoid any scandal attaching himself to your sister's name

69
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,360
only in the presence of a member,or members, of your family.

70
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,290
In which case, I am more than happy to

71
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,230
offer you and your family

72
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,400
my private chambers in the palace.

73
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,330
As it happens,they are adjacent to the King's private chambers,

74
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,670
the connecting gallery for greater privacy.

75
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,210
-You are most generous,  Mr. Secretary.

76
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,810
I am sure my father will like to repay your kindness.

77
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,150
-You've given the Seymours your rooms?

78
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,450
-Yes,Your Majesty.  -Idiot.

79
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,460
We have just given royal assent to the Act stripping

80
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,430
the bishopric of Norwich of the town of Lynn.

81
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,700
The new beneficiary is to be Thomas Boleyn, Earl of Wiltshire.

82
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,170
I also intend giving him two of the dissolved abbeys.

83
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,570
You must inform him of his good fortune.

84
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,470
-Yes,Your Majesty.

85
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,080
-No one must know our plans, Mr. Cromwell.

86
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,690
-Come here,Jane. Let me look at you.

87
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,130
How beautiful you are!

88
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:14,240
Ready?  -Yes.

89
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,770
-Shall we?

90
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,620
-Jane.  -Your Majesty.

91
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,660
-I have something for you.

92
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,040
Now open it.

93
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,220
-Thank you.

94
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,290
I will treasure this all my life.

95
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,990
And if they ever open my grave, they will find it again,

96
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,500
right next to my heart.

97
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,180
-Majesty.

98
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,400
-I wonder why,after all this time,he still will not marry Madge?

99
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,730
-I think Norris comes

100
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,830
into your chamber more for Your  Majesty than he does for Madge.

101
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,240
-For me?  -Yeah.

102
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,810
-Cromwell's rooms?  -Yes.

103
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,940
-What is that?

104
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,200
-It's a locket,Your Majesty.

105
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,540
-Let me see it.

106
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,350
Let me see it.

107
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,180
-Mr. Secretary!

108
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,590
-Your Majesty.

109
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,720
I have some good news for Your Majesty. The Bill for the dissolution

110
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,360
of the large monasteries has just been passed Parliament.

111
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,260
Our reformation is moving apace.

112
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,570
-I have been told privately, Mr. Secretary,that the King has already sold

113
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,510
Sawley Abbey in Yorkshire to one of his courtiers,

114
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:12,010
even though the Bill has not yet reached the statute book,and

115
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,380
plainly on your advice.

116
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,510
Our reformation was never meant to be about personal gain.

117
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,520
Religious houses should not be sold off

118
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,590
but converted to better uses.

119
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,620
-Madam,

120
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,790
the confiscated assets will be used to the pleasure of Almighty God

121
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,130
and to the profit of this realm

122
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,900
which is but a pygmy,

123
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,200
but will one day be greater even than Spain!

124
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,310
-So is it true you have given your private rooms here to the Seymours?

125
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,980
I am the Queen of England. You will answer me. Is it true?

126
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,220
-Yes. It's true.

127
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,750
-You have over-reached yourself,Mr. Cromwell.

128
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,060
Believe me,you have placed yourself in very great danger.

129
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,000
Do you believe me?

130
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,500
Or do you assume I no longer posses the power to crush you?

131
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,040
It would be an easy mistake      to make,Mr. Cromwell.

132
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,460
-I thought you might like this returned to you.

133
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,200
-Thank you.

134
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,110
-Good evening Your Excellency,

135
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,080
Please,may I take your hat?

136
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,450
-His Excellency the Imperial Ambassador.

137
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,120
-Ah,Eustace. It's so good of you to come all the way

138
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,590
to Shoreditch. -Believe me,Mr. Secretary,

139
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,260
I would travel a great deal further for the pleasure of talking to you.

140
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,040
May I be blunt?

141
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,540
Is it true that you have

142
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,950
fallen out with Queen Anne?

143
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,350
-Yes.

144
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,350
I believe she hates me

145
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,250
wants to have me executed.

146
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,190
-Are you not afraid?

147
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,590
-No.

148
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,430
No I trust my master so much...

149
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,730
I fancy she can't do me any harm.

150
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,170
-Nevertheless, I cannot but wish you

151
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,800
a more gracious mistress.

152
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,370
One more grateful for the

153
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,380
inestimable service you have done the King.

154
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,740
-For the sake of argument,

155
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,110
suppose the King

156
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,620
was considering

157
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,450
taking another wife?

158
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,560
-It would certainly be to his advantage.

159
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,720
For here is a King

160
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,490
who has so far been disappointed of male issue,

161
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,260
and who knows very well that his present marriage

162
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,830
will never be held as lawful.

163
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,410
-The king requests your presence at the court.

164
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:33,340
I am sure he wishes to confirm a new alliance with the Emperor.

165
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,180
What else he means to tell you,I cannot guess.

166
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,380
-Then I look forward

167
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,220
eagerly to finding out, Mr. Secretary.

168
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,970
-Madam,

169
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,810
Lady Rochford. -Lady Rochford,

170
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,180
what can I do for you?

171
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,110
-You could ask your brother to be kind to me.

172
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,750
He is cruel in every way.

173
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,090
-Come now... I don't believe you.

174
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,860
-There are others he has preferred to me.

175
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,730
-Hush!

176
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,360
-You don't understand.

177
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,070
He does not treat me as his proper wife,

178
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,800
as the King treats you.

179
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,440
-Let me tell you something, Lady Rochford.

180
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:39,040
The King cannot satisfy a woman.

181
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,210
He has neither the skill, nor the virility.

182
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,130
-We must give up the idea of a French alliance.

183
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,470
The King seems implacably against it,

184
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,040
just as he seems more and more inclined to embrace a new alliance with the Emperor...

185
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,010
Are you listening to me?

186
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,010
-Yes,father.

187
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,280
-It seems that most of the country is still in favor

188
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,750
of an Imperial alliance, so it would serve us

189
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,410
nothing to swim against the tide.

190
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,680
-No.

191
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,950
-The Imperial Ambassador is to be received at court.

192
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,520
You will make a great fuss of him. In the first place

193
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,490
by inviting him to kiss your cheek.

194
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,500
Then you and the King will dine with him,

195
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,700
and you will say some harsh things against the French

196
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,630
in the presence of the other ambassadors say how they

197
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,040
have betrayed your trust,are hypocrites and false friends.

198
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,410
Whatever you can think of. -Yes Father.

199
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,280
-Anne,we have come so far.

200
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,680
No one is going to be allowed

201
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,620
to destroy us.

202
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,690
No one!

203
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,190
Do you understand?

204
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,560
-I understand.

205
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,790
-His Excellency, the Imperial Ambassador.

206
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,560
-Jesus.

207
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,160
-Their gracious Majesties

208
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,040
[Greetings]

209
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,160
-After Mass,Mr. Chapuys is sure to dine with us?

210
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,400
But he's gone!

211
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,710
-It is not without good reason.

212
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,280
-Something is happening,Mark.

213
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,710
I just don't know what it is.

214
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,790
-Eminency,

215
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,800
I know that,in the past,there have been misunderstandings

216
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,770
between my family and you.

217
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,570
Some intemperate words.

218
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,400
Certain things that should not have been said,

219
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,170
and are now regretted.

220
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,710
But we both live in a real world.

221
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,650
We must take our friends as we find them.

222
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,710
I know the Emperor is keen to protect

223
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,480
his lucrative trade links with England.

224
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:44,190
And obviously my family is in a position to help and assist him

225
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,420
which is what we are determined to do.

226
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,130
-So I think we should drink a toast to new beginnings,

227
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,600
and new friendships and to a mutually beneficial future.

228
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,930
-Salut.  -Salut.

229
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,640
-Salut.

230
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,850
-And where are you from, Excellency?

231
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,790
-I am proud to be the Ambassador from Milan,Madam.

232
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,160
-Ah,Milan.

233
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,230
Were you not occupied by the French?

234
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,660
-Alas,we are still

235
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,730
occupied by French troops.

236
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,570
-Then you will agree with me that the French are deceitful in everything?

237
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:35,070
In fact,can anyone here tell me

238
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,080
that the French are anything but liars and hypocrites?

239
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,780
Do they ever tell the truth?

240
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,650
How many treaties do they honor,

241
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,150
how many promises do they keep?

242
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,930
-Mr. Cromwell, what is happening?

243
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,330
-His Majesty will soon be having an audience with

244
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,030
the Ambassador. That's what we're waiting for.

245
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,610
-Your Excellency,

246
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,640
follow me.

247
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,350
-Excuse me.

248
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,590
-Excellency.

249
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,030
I hear your master is anxious for an alliance?

250
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,500
-He is,Your Majesty.  -On what terms?

251
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,830
-On such terms as Mr. Cromwell

252
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,240
has outlined to us.

253
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,770
The restoration of some relation

254
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,110
between England and Rome,

255
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,710
the inclusion of the Lady Mary in the line of succession,

256
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,180
and support for the Emperor in his war with France over Milan.

257
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,550
As far as the Lady Mary is concerned,

258
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,490
it may be that God has not thought to send Your Majesty

259
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:59,190
a male issue because he believes that

260
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,790
England should have a female succession.

261
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,500
-What are you alleging,Excellency?

262
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:13,300
Am I not a man as other men?

263
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,210
Am I not?

264
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:21,350
AM I NOT?

265
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,250
You do not know all my secrets.

266
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,860
I want everything in writing.  The Emperor's offer.

267
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,470
Everything in writing. -That is not possible, Your Majesty.

268
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,000
-Do you think I am a child,

269
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,610
to be first whipped and then petted?

270
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,080
If your master wants to deal with me,he must first apologize

271
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,850
for all his ill-treatment on me in the past.

272
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,020
He must accept Queen Anne.

273
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,190
I have nothing more to say to your master.

274
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,210
-Princes are different from us, and are not to be easily understood.

275
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,470
Gentlemen

276
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,300
-Your Grace.  -Majesty.

277
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,230
As your oldest friend

278
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,700
as well as your most loyal subject.

279
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,270
I feel it's my duty, however painful

280
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,640
to report some truths to you.

281
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:00,540
-"Truth?",said jesting Pilate.

282
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,980
"What is truth?"

283
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,390
-There are rumors about the Queen's behavior.

284
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,290
It seems

285
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,220
she entertains men in her rooms,

286
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,960
flirts

287
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,230
and behaves intimately with them...

288
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:33,540
-My Lords,this kingdom is in peril and in danger.

289
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,910
But not by some foreign power or strangers with evil intent against us.

290
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,820
It has come to my notice

291
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,650
that some acts of treason, and other offences,

292
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,250
have been committed by those we loved and trusted,

293
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,790
by members of our own court.

294
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,690
Mr. Rich,

295
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,630
as Solicitor General I am appointing

296
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,500
you and Mr. Cromwell

297
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,100
to head a commission of oyer and terminer

298
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,170
to investigate whether or not these offences be true.

299
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,180
Good day,gentlemen.

300
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,150
-Lady Sheldon,

301
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,490
I warn you not to repeat to anyone

302
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,090
what passes between us here today.

303
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,000
You live in close proximity with Her Majesty the Queen.

304
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,670
Have you ever seen her entertain men

305
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,270
in her chambers in what you would consider an

306
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,270
inappropriate way?

307
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,140
-No,Sir.

308
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,480
-You are certain?

309
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,450
-Yes,Sir.

310
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,960
-I must warn you,my Lady,

311
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,760
that those concealing the truth from those

312
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,690
commissioned by the King to discover it,are themselves

313
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,030
guilty of treason,

314
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,500
and are very likely to be hanged.

315
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,840
-Your Majesty.

316
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,180
-Jane. For very good reasons

317
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,880
I want you to leave Whitehall for a while.

318
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,720
Go back home with your father. -I will leave.

319
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,390
Of course I will do anything Your Majesty commands me to do.

320
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,590
-I want to tell you that in this slippery world,

321
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,090
you represent for me all that is innocent,

322
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,660
everything that is good,

323
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,560
unsullied,

324
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,670
uncorrupted.

325
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,970
It will not be for long.

326
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,610
And after that...

327
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,510
After that we can have our hearts' desires.

328
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,880
Go.

329
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,760
-Are you certain?

330
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,830
C'mon!

331
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:06,130
-It's true that some men

332
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,700
came into the Queen's chambers...

333
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,000
at undue hours.

334
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,140
And sometimes she flirted with them but...

335
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,210
-What are their names?

336
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,650
-Lord Rochford... of course.

337
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,650
-And?

338
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,780
-And Sir Henry Norris...

339
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,150
-And?

340
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,090
-The King's groom,Brereton...

341
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,630
-And?

342
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,860
-Mark Smeaton,the musician...

343
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,960
-And?

344
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,530
AND?

345
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:49,610
-Well,I saw her hugging and kissing her brother.

346
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,650
-Her brother?

347
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,490
-But thought nothing of it...

348
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,330
-Do you believe this to be true?

349
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,040
-I believe that is true,yes.

350
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,310
-You believe that your husband

351
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,450
has committed incest with the Queen?

352
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,260
-Hello?

353
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,500
Hello?

354
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,740
Ah! Mr. Cromwell,

355
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,280
to what do I owe this great pleasure?

356
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,620
-Shhh... Calm Mr. Smeaton.

357
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,830
-Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

358
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,570
-I want to know when you slept with the Queen. And how many times you slept with her?

359
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,900
-I never slept with the Queen.

360
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,210
I never slept with the Queen.

361
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,140
I don't understand. Mr. Cromwell.

362
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,610
-You gonna have to tell the truth. I want the truth.

363
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,150
Or God help me it will go badly with you.

364
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,520
-I swear by Almighty God.

365
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,450
I never slept with Her Majesty.

366
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,690
Don't do anything to hurt me.

367
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,590
-You are only a poor musician  and yet recently you spent a great deal of money

368
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,200
on horses and liveries for your servants! Where did you get the money?

369
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,130
Was it for services rendered.

370
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,570
-I swear to God Almighty.

371
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,040
I never slept with Her Majesty.

372
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,350
-Off we go,and...

373
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,790
Now,quicker then... ?

374
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,560
One,two,three,four...

375
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:32,000
Ah,Lady Sheldon! I believe you know what you are doing.

376
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:38,780
Left arm... comme a.

377
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,280
Back,and after spring...

378
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,250
Continue.

379
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:53,320
-Your visit to France with the King is postponed for a week.

380
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,130
-Why?

381
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,260
-And there's something else...

382
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,660
Mark Smeaton is arrested.

383
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,000
-What for? -We don't know yet.

384
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,300
I've gotta go.

385
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,350
-Sir Henry,you are here again!

386
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,220
Did you never seem to have the courage to marry the Lady?

387
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
-Madam,

388
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,220
marriage is not something to hurry into.

389
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,660
-No. I know the truth.

390
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:03,630
You look for dead men's shoes.

391
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,300
-Madam? I really must protest.

392
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,530
-I mean,you suppose that if anything bad

393
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,630
happen to the King, then you would think to have me.

394
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,540
-Madam,if I ever had such a thought,

395
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,170
then I wish my head were cut off.

396
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,980
-Oh,that could be arranged.

397
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,660
Nan,

398
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:36,190
-Madam.

399
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,360
Get them to fetch Elizabeth to me tomorrow. I want to see my daughter.

400
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:43,300
-Yes,Madam. -And,Nan,

401
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,600
if anything should happen to me,

402
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,310
would you promise to care for her?

403
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,110
-Yes,Madam.

404
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,020
[Screaming]

405
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,800
-Sooner or later,Mr. Smeaton, you will tell us the truth.

406
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,800
So?

407
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,040
-It's not true. -What?

408
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,100
-It's not true. -What?  -It's not true.

409
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,910
-The King has called an emergency meeting of the Council.

410
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,510
-Why wasn't I told?

411
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,580
-Because I wasn't told either!

412
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,350
For God's sake, make sure you keep the King always in your sight!

413
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,320
-Majesty!

414
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:12,120
Mr. Cromwell approaches.

415
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,160
-Smeaton has confessed.

416
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,670
-Sir Henry...  -Sir.  -Come with me!

417
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:46,590
Did you know the Queen was pregnant again?

418
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,860
-No,your Majesty! How should I?

419
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:53,300
-Because you may be the child's father...

420
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,530
...since you love her so well, as many have testified.

421
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,640
-Your Majesty is being ridiculous.

422
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,170
-So then I'm a figure of ridicule to you?

423
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,240
-Guards! Arrest him.

424
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:09,910
Take him to the Tower!

425
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,350
-Majesty?... Majesty?... Majesty?

426
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,720
Benedicta et venerabilis es,virgo Maria. Virgo dei genetrix,quem totus capit orbis,

427
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,030
in tua se clausit viscera, facta homo.

428
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:25,630
Dei genitrix intercede pro nobis.

429
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,970
In nomine Patris et Filii...  -Master Brereton,

430
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:30,700
by order of the King you are arrested for High Treason.  -...et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.

431
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:56,330
-Where are you going,my Lord?

432
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,260
-I have to see the King. -It's too late,George.

433
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,860
Much too late.

434
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,170
-My Lord... Sir Thomas...

435
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,970
you are both arrested for High Treason,and having

436
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,470
carnal knowledge of her Majesty the Queen.

437
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,180
-What?

438
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,560
-Henry,please.

439
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,070
Henry,please.

440
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:38,070
For the love you bear our child. For the love of Elizabeth...

441
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:42,110
-You lied to me. You have always lied to me. -Have mercy. No.

442
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,470
-You were not a virgin when you married me.

443
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,740
You were not what you seemed.

444
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,280
Your father and your brother arranged everything.

445
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,880
-No. I loved you...

446
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:56,320
I loved you and I love you still.

447
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,950
Please after everything we have been to each other.

448
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,120
After everything we were. Please.

449
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,030
One more chance... One more...

450
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,170
Henry...

451
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,380
Your Majesty...

452
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,980
Your Majesty... I beseech you.

453
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:33,320
-You know why you have been arrested.

454
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,530
It is not enough that you commit vile incest

455
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,230
on your sister the Queen, her tongue in your mouth,

456
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,200
your tongue in hers,

457
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,470
against the commands of God Almighty...

458
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:51,540
But you must plot regicide

459
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,510
against the King,

460
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,780
so that Anne could marry  one of her lover's and rule

461
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:59,420
as regent for her bastard child.

462
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,060
-No,sir.

463
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:10,560
You baffle me.

464
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,700
My enemies

465
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,370
have poisoned the air with their horrid lies.

466
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:19,140
Whatever my sister has done,

467
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,140
it is not with me,or mine.

468
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,150
I am innocent,Mr. Cromwell.

469
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:31,320
I swear to you.

470
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,350
I swear on the blood of Christ.

471
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,890
I am innocent.

472
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,030
-Course you are.

473
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:47,030
Tell me,Mr. Brereton

474
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,370
did you ever have

475
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:52,340
carnal knowledge of the Queen's Majesty?

476
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,850
-Yes.

477
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,090
Yes,I did.

478
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:21,370
-I condemn them utterly. All those men,

479
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,400
whatever their rank or station...

480
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,800
whatever their rank or station,who...

481
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,910
deceived the King and slipped between the sheets with his lawful wife.

482
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,140
I can't...

483
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,780
...utterly.

484
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:38,080
For such

485
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,120
awful adultery,

486
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:43,490
there should be only one punishment.

487
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,320
-My Lords,why have you come?

488
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,730
-This is the warrant for your arrest.

489
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:24,430
You are charged with committing adultery with Mark Smeaton,

490
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,430
Sir Henry Norris and William Brereton.

491
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,930
Both Smeaton and Brereton

492
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,970
have already confessed their guilt.

493
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,200
-We are come at the King's command

494
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,510
to conduct you to the Tower,there to abide

495
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:37,740
during His Majesty's pleasure.

496
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,780
-If it be His Majesty's pleasure,

497
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:49,220
then I am ready to obey.

498
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,090
Lady Sh--   -There is no time to change your clothes

499
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,320
or pack any of your things.

500
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:56,030
Money will be provided for your needs at the Tower.

501
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,120
-My Lords,I beg you,

502
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,260
before you go,to beseech the King's Grace

503
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,360
to be good to me.

504
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,300
-Madame,this way,I pray you.

505
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,690
-I pray God will help me, for there is no truth in these allegations.

506
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,560
-This way.

507
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,770
-I am the King's true wedded wife!

508
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,740
I am not guilty of these charges.

509
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,310
I am as free from the company of man

510
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,820
as I am from sin.

511
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,590
Do I go into a dungeon, Mr. Kingston?

512
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:37,560
-No,Madam. There are lodgings made ready for you.

513
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,130
-It's too good for me.

514
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,900
Jesus have mercy on me.

515
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:50,470
Thank you,thank you.

516
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,050
May I have the Holy Sacrament placed in my room, so I may pray for mercy?

517
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:14,560
-Your Grace.

518
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:23,170
-Your Grace?

519
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,180
-I have just heard of the Queen's arrest.

520
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,780
My mind is clean amazed.

521
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:31,880
I cannot believe that she is guilty of such abominable crimes...

522
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,220
...yet I cannot think

523
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:41,660
the King would have proceeded so far

524
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:43,790
unless she was culpable.

525
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,330
-It has caused both the King and myself

526
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,070
a great pain to discover her deceit;

527
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:51,200
the depth of her depravity.

528
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:56,440
-The fact is,Mr. Cromwell,

529
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,980
that I loved her not a little for the love

530
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,610
which I judged her to bear towards God and the Gospel.

531
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,720
Next to his grace the King,and yourself,

532
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,250
I was most bound to her of all creatures living.

533
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,620
-Then you must learn to live without her.

534
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:14,590
-But,without her,is not our reformation in danger?

535
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,290
Was she not our great supporter and advocate?

536
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,260
-Who would likely have become our greatest liability.

537
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:22,070
Sometimes,Your Grace, in order to defeat evil,

538
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,570
one must learn to consort with the devil.

539
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,470
His Majesty is waiting for Your Grace

540
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,810
to discover a reason why his marriage to Anne Boleyn

541
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,780
should be considered null and void.

542
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,580
He expects your verdict presently.

543
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:02,470
-What of the others?

544
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:05,510
-Smeaton,Brereton,

545
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:07,710
Norris and George Boleyn

546
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:10,710
have been found guilty...

547
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,550
and are to be executed tomorrow.

548
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,660
-You know what Cromwell told me?

549
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,700
He told me she had to do with over a hundred men!

550
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,230
A hundred fucking men,Charles.

551
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:36,070
You know what?

552
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:40,410
You know what? My daughter, Mary,owes God a great deal

553
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:44,380
for escaping the hands of that poisoning whore.

554
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,880
She planned to have a poisoned child... It's true!

555
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:49,190
just like she poisoned Katharine.

556
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:52,160
We have proof.

557
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,190
Her baby...

558
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:57,390
Her baby was deformed. Did you know that Charles?

559
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:00,430
So it couldn't have been mine!

560
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,900
Perhaps Elizabeth isn't even mine!

561
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:12,180
That fucking bitch.

562
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,170
-The Queen was tried yesterday at Westminster Hall.

563
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,340
She pleaded not guilty to all the charges against her

564
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,710
but the evidence being overwhelming,

565
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:50,610
she was sentenced to death, either by burning or by decapitation,

566
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,280
according to the King's pleasure.

567
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,100
-And her accomplices?

568
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,300
What of us?

569
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:15,840
-Smeaton,Brereton, Norris and George Boleyn, all guilty as charged.

570
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,880
-Thomas,what about me?

571
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:25,850
Am I to be tried too.

572
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:31,820
-No. We found no evidence against you.

573
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,620
You are to be released.

574
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,400
Eventually.

575
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,510
-I am the only one who is guilty.

576
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:50,900
-I say to you...

577
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:54,270
I say to you trust in God,

578
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:57,270
and not in the vanities of this world,

579
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:00,910
for if I had done so,

580
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,280
I think I would still be alive,

581
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:06,180
as you are now.

582
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,270
-Oh God...

583
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:03,770
-These bloody days have broken my heart:

584
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,200
My lust,my youth did them depart.

585
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:11,140
For your wit alone,many men would bemoan.

586
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:13,510
And since it is so,

587
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,850
many still cry loud.

588
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:17,910
It is a great loss that you are dead and gone.

589
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,890
The time you had about above your poor degree.

590
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:33,700
The fall whereof your  friends may well bemoan.

591
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:36,830
A rotten twig

592
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,800
upon so high a tree

593
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,840
has slipped your hold,  and you are dead.

594
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:43,610
And gone.

595
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:06,300
These bloody days have  broken my heart.

596
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,270
My lust.

597
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:12,300
My youth did them depart,

598
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,140
and blind desire  of ambitious souls.

599
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:19,010
Who hastes to climb

600
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:21,410
seeks to revert:

601
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:24,380
And about the throne

602
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,050
the thunder rolls.
