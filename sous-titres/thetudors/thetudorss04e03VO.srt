Lady Anne of Cleves.

3
00:00:03,882 --> 00:00:05,590
Welcome to my court.

4
00:00:06,415 --> 00:00:09,467
Why did Your Majesty invite
Lady Anne of Cleves for Christmas?

5
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:12,468
I like her after all.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,848
He ought not to have divorced
the Lady Anne.

7
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,809
I fear that you will have
to reconcile yourself to the new queen.

8
00:00:18,153 --> 00:00:20,488
No, I will not. I hate her.

9
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,607
Tell me, my Lord Surrey,
what are your ambitions?

10
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,568
To surpass the achievements
of my father and my grandfather.

11
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,070
The Earl has made it plain
that he despises us.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,828
Says you tried to entrap him
but he is too noble a beast

13
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:34,117
to be tangled by such cunning hooks.

14
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,331
I have come here to ask you why
you will not show me the respect

15
00:00:37,498 --> 00:00:41,123
which, as Queen of England,
I'm entitled to expect even from you.

16
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,752
You are thought capable
of bearing sons.

17
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,630
Unfortunately, I see
you are still not pregnant.

18
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:50,088
She is very appealing.

19
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:51,885
Do you really want to?

20
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,689
I can arrange it.

21
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,015
The ulcer on His Majesty's leg
has become clogged again.

22
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,707
I fear for His Majesty's life.

23
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,396
His Majesty remains indisposed.

24
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,911
Why will he not see me?

25
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:06,704
Has he taken a mistress?

26
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:08,234
I can't answer Your Majesty.

27
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,612
- I'm sorry.
- Go, since you won't tell me anything.

28
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:14,491
You know, I would do anything
to bring you comfort and make you happy.

29
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:19,037
- He wants to visit you, privately.
- That's not possible.

30
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:21,957
Nobody else need ever know.
Not the King,

31
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,249
not anybody.

Your Majesty.

49
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:49,087
I haven't seen you for
a good while. I'm sorry.

50
00:04:49,886 --> 00:04:52,036
I did not know the reason for it.

51
00:04:52,298 --> 00:04:53,600
No one told me.

52
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:56,017
I was unwell.
But now I am better.

53
00:04:57,303 --> 00:04:58,464
Thank God.

54
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:03,261
I trust you found something
to amuse yourself while I was away?

55
00:05:08,511 --> 00:05:10,351
I missed Your Majesty so much.

56
00:05:10,754 --> 00:05:12,270
I hope they gave you my gifts.

57
00:05:13,127 --> 00:05:14,814
Your gifts are not you.

58
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,284
My Lord Surrey.

59
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:20,803
Majesty.

60
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:25,805
You are a blood relative of my wife.

61
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,495
For that reason, and because
you so distinguished yourself in France,

62
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:33,021
I've decided to make you a Knight
of the Order of the Garter.

63
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,784
Does it please you?

64
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:40,298
I am deeply grateful, Your Majesty.

65
00:05:41,346 --> 00:05:42,559
My Lord Surrey.

66
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:44,175
Majesty.

67
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:56,125
I have something for you.

68
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:12,087
Thank you.

69
00:06:12,647 --> 00:06:13,904
It's beautiful.

70
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,120
So are you.

71
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:29,288
I am going away tomorrow,
for a few days.

72
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,645
But tonight I will visit
to your bedchamber.

73
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,620
For nothing would please me more
than for you to conceive my child.

74
00:07:04,735 --> 00:07:07,019
- Your Majesty, good morning.
- My Lord Bishop.

75
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:10,477
Your Majesty, these poor suffering
subjects, they have begged leave

76
00:07:10,644 --> 00:07:14,197
to receive Your Majesty's
gift of grace.

77
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,682
So if Your Majesty might consent
to lay your hands upon them?

78
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:30,758
<i>Your Majesty, please.
Please, Your Majesty.</i>

79
00:07:33,464 --> 00:07:36,539
By the Grace of God,
I command you to be healed.

80
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,029
By the Grace of God,
I command you to be healed.

81
00:07:56,789 --> 00:07:57,707
<i>Please.</i>

82
00:07:57,874 --> 00:08:01,064
By the Grace of God,
I command you to be healed.

83
00:08:07,763 --> 00:08:11,015
By the Grace of God,
I command you to be healed.

84
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:14,379
Your Majesty.
God bless Your Majesty.

85
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:36,432
By the Grace of God,

86
00:08:36,943 --> 00:08:38,643
I command you to be healed.

87
00:08:39,982 --> 00:08:42,141
God bless you, Your Majesty.

88
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:44,008
Thank you, Your Majesty.

89
00:08:46,774 --> 00:08:47,974
Oh, thank you.

90
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,099
Thank you, Your Majesty.

91
00:08:57,266 --> 00:08:58,657
Thank you, Your Majesty.

92
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,582
God bless you, Your Majesty!

HEVER CASTLE
RESIDENCE OF ANNE DE CLEVES

94
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:14,434
Bravo, my Lady. Bravo!

95
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:20,079
- Your Majesty.
- Majesty.

96
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:27,456
Your Majesty.

97
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:30,333
Did I surprise you?

98
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:31,881
Good.

99
00:10:38,844 --> 00:10:40,071
Lady Elizabeth.

100
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:41,288
Your Grace.

101
00:10:43,253 --> 00:10:44,661
I have a gift for you.

102
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,844
How is your Latin?

103
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:49,776
I enjoy learning it,
thank you, Your Majesty.

104
00:10:51,086 --> 00:10:53,546
Mr Grindle, the tutor you gave me,

105
00:10:53,943 --> 00:10:55,625
is an excellent teacher.

106
00:10:57,745 --> 00:11:01,673
This book is by
the Roman historian Tacitus.

107
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,724
Now you may find it
difficult to read

108
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,993
but the effort will be worthwhile.

109
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:11,050
For without knowledge,
life is not worth having.

110
00:11:13,582 --> 00:11:15,682
Thank you so much, Your Majesty.

111
00:11:19,684 --> 00:11:21,057
I am very grateful

112
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:23,891
and thank God every night
for your good health,

113
00:11:24,238 --> 00:11:27,561
and trust you will be
our good King, and father,

114
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:29,063
a long time.

115
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:33,935
Madam.

116
00:11:34,964 --> 00:11:37,905
I have come for supper. I hope
that doesn't inconvenience you.

117
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,784
I think we may find something
in the larder, Your Majesty.

118
00:11:42,065 --> 00:11:43,336
Good.

119
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:47,521
Your formal installation into the Order
will take place soon, my Lord Surrey.

120
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:50,376
The King's grace has commanded me
to prepare you for the event,

121
00:11:50,964 --> 00:11:53,214
which I am happy and willing to do.

122
00:11:53,431 --> 00:11:56,506
I am sure your lordship is aware
of the great significance

123
00:11:56,673 --> 00:12:00,435
attached to the Order by His Majesty
and the great honor

124
00:12:00,602 --> 00:12:04,083
that he conveys upon you
by electing you to it.

125
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,352
As you know, the Order comprises
of twenty-five

126
00:12:08,704 --> 00:12:11,188
noble and valiant knights
and their sovereign.

127
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,053
There is no greater
honor in England.

128
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:17,820
Your lordship has no need
to sell the Order to me.

129
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,949
How long have you
belonged to the Order?

130
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,370
- I was elected earlier this year.
- A few months.

131
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:31,618
My father and four generations
of my family

132
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,706
have already belonged to it.

133
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:37,995
Shall we eat?

134
00:12:50,226 --> 00:12:52,372
Where do you suppose
the King has gone?

135
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:54,655
I don't know, Your Majesty.

136
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:03,318
They tell me there's
a full moon tomorrow

137
00:13:03,485 --> 00:13:05,534
and we shall all
behave like lunatics.

138
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:09,440
For some, the moon
is the planet of love.

139
00:13:17,852 --> 00:13:19,131
I want to see him again.

140
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:26,305
As you wish.

141
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:31,547
Perhaps...

142
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:34,179
I could bring him to my room.

143
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,979
Then I could wait outside,
in case anyone should come.

144
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,816
I only urge Your Majesty
to be careful,

145
00:13:45,983 --> 00:13:48,964
- when you...
- What, Lady Rochford?

146
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:53,999
Don't you think I know how to meddle
with a man without conceiving a child?

147
00:14:14,432 --> 00:14:16,756
Your Majesty should be
proud of your daughters.

148
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:17,987
Both of them.

149
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:19,866
They do you a great credit.

150
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:22,204
The Lady Mary is...

151
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,823
very serious and religious
but very clever.

152
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:30,915
Like some women,
she likes to hide her intelligence.

153
00:14:31,157 --> 00:14:35,086
But the Lady Elizabeth,
she cannot hide her intelligence.

154
00:14:35,563 --> 00:14:37,505
She will be a great lady,

155
00:14:38,188 --> 00:14:41,072
I think... if God so wills it.

156
00:14:42,802 --> 00:14:43,952
Your Majesty.

157
00:14:47,815 --> 00:14:51,355
I have something which I should
like to return to Your Majesty.

158
00:14:55,272 --> 00:14:56,572
My wedding ring.

159
00:14:58,168 --> 00:15:00,274
I should like you
to break it into pieces,

160
00:15:01,688 --> 00:15:03,118
as a thing of no value.

161
00:15:24,276 --> 00:15:25,276
Katherine?

162
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:27,077
Sweetheart?

163
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:28,368
Yes?

164
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,142
Do you like our meeting like this?

165
00:15:34,732 --> 00:15:35,528
Yes.

166
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:38,524
Do you love me?

167
00:15:41,883 --> 00:15:45,052
Let me perceive by some token
that you love me.

168
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:48,525
Shall I kiss you?

169
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,560
We have kissed before,
Katherine sweet.

170
00:15:58,476 --> 00:16:00,068
It does not mean that you love me.

171
00:16:02,668 --> 00:16:04,418
What else can I show you?

172
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,625
My Lord Surrey,

173
00:16:36,184 --> 00:16:39,184
I am commanded now
to invest you with the Garter,

174
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:42,112
for you to wear
at your installation.

175
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,841
<i>"Honni soit qui mal y pense."</i>

176
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,135
"Evil be to him who evil thinks."

177
00:17:05,013 --> 00:17:05,941
Sir.

178
00:17:08,222 --> 00:17:11,031
The most friendly
Companions of this Order,

179
00:17:11,352 --> 00:17:13,312
denominated from the Garter,

180
00:17:14,027 --> 00:17:17,483
have admitted you, their friend,
brother, and companion,

181
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:19,508
in faithful testimony of which

182
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:22,131
they impart and give you the Garter,

183
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:25,982
which God grant that you,
deservedly receiving it,

184
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:29,549
may rightly wear
and use to the Glory of God.

185
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,227
Thank you, my friends,

186
00:17:36,152 --> 00:17:37,152
brothers,

187
00:17:38,668 --> 00:17:39,918
and companions.

188
00:17:43,624 --> 00:17:44,521
Your Grace.

189
00:17:59,224 --> 00:18:00,829
You know I am very grateful to you

190
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,166
for raising no objection
to the annulment of our marriage.

191
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:08,191
It runs rather counter
to my experience of women.

192
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:10,133
Your Majesty,

193
00:18:10,935 --> 00:18:12,335
I can truly say

194
00:18:12,502 --> 00:18:16,382
that I wish in all things
to please you as my Lord,

195
00:18:16,743 --> 00:18:19,438
to bear testament
to your good treatment of me,

196
00:18:19,605 --> 00:18:23,102
and to stay in this country
that I already love as my own.

197
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:31,145
Do you know what the French
Ambassador wrote about you?

198
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:34,341
We... intercepted his letter.

199
00:18:36,354 --> 00:18:39,323
He said that our people much
regretted our divorce,

200
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:42,329
and that in a short time
you had won their love,

201
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:47,178
and that they esteemed you
as one of the most sweet,

202
00:18:48,237 --> 00:18:49,237
gracious,

203
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:51,880
and humane queens they had ever had.

204
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:01,473
You have another queen now.

205
00:19:02,003 --> 00:19:03,003
Yes.

206
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,258
I like her.

207
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:09,709
She is beautiful, of course.

208
00:19:11,323 --> 00:19:13,323
And very young.
Full of life.

209
00:19:14,032 --> 00:19:15,195
You must adore her.

210
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:34,806
My Lady!

211
00:19:41,683 --> 00:19:42,683
My Lady...

212
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:06,794
You did your duty.

213
00:20:08,147 --> 00:20:09,547
He's insufferable.

214
00:20:09,936 --> 00:20:11,986
He thinks us all his inferiors.

215
00:20:12,706 --> 00:20:14,903
Unfortunately,
we did him the great favor

216
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,152
of making
a member of his family the Queen.

217
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:19,817
What is made
can sometimes be unmade,

218
00:20:20,357 --> 00:20:21,407
like a bed.

219
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,089
What chance is there?

220
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:26,463
The King is besotted by her.
Everyone knows that.

221
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:27,923
That may change.

222
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,771
She seems to me nothing
but a frivolous and stupid girl.

223
00:20:31,423 --> 00:20:32,523
In any case,

224
00:20:34,228 --> 00:20:36,952
I want you to teach
the Earl a lesson in humility.

225
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:40,781
I will be called a she-wolf

226
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
by no man,

227
00:20:43,187 --> 00:20:47,191
nor should you allow the slanders
against our family to go unpunished.

228
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,416
Surely,

229
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:51,889
my dear husband,

230
00:20:52,922 --> 00:20:56,072
you could arrange for some
misfortune to befall him?

231
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,279
Hello, my friends!

232
00:22:03,082 --> 00:22:04,615
Jesus Christ!

233
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:06,616
Not quite!

234
00:22:06,948 --> 00:22:10,317
As you see, I have been
received into the most noble,

235
00:22:10,484 --> 00:22:13,188
most prestigious
Order of the Garter.

236
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,048
And here indeed is the garter!

237
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:19,446
<i>"Honni soit qui mal y pense."</i>

238
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:23,928
"Evil to him who evil thinks!"

239
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,859
It's a good motto.

240
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,450
I agree with it.

241
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,822
Ale, please!

242
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,371
My responsibilities to the Order

243
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:34,501
have already made me
dreadfully thirsty.

244
00:22:34,668 --> 00:22:36,918
Very fine, my Lord! Thank you.

245
00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:40,532
How in God's name did you
afford all this, my Lord?

246
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:44,245
I have often had no money,
but I have never been poor.

247
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:47,880
Wench! How would you like
to suck the cock of a man

248
00:22:48,047 --> 00:22:50,409
who's a member
of the Order of the Garter?

249
00:22:50,576 --> 00:22:52,251
What would your friends say?

250
00:22:53,024 --> 00:22:56,560
They would tell me not to
swallow stories like that.

251
00:22:59,362 --> 00:23:00,362
Your hand!

252
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:04,429
It is...

253
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,133
all naked.

254
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,018
There, there, there.

255
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,580
It is dressed.

256
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,482
Thank you.

257
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:23,042
Come here.

258
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,357
More ale. Drink up, my friend.
Drink up.

259
00:23:31,152 --> 00:23:32,152
My Lords,

260
00:23:32,807 --> 00:23:35,419
we must before long agree
on these plans

261
00:23:35,586 --> 00:23:37,769
for our much-delayed progress
to the North.

262
00:23:39,128 --> 00:23:42,124
We shall take a large retinue,
including men-at-arms,

263
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:46,194
since we mean to visit those parts
of our realm which, not long ago,

264
00:23:46,361 --> 00:23:48,888
rose in rebellion against us

265
00:23:49,648 --> 00:23:52,986
This time we expect the people,
being pardoned by Our Grace,

266
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,699
to make further submissions

267
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:57,019
in acknowledgments
of their past depravities.

268
00:23:58,261 --> 00:23:59,261
My Lady.

269
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:03,890
It is also our intention to
invite James, King of Scots,

270
00:24:04,441 --> 00:24:06,028
to meet with us at York
in September.

271
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:09,979
Your Majesty.

272
00:24:10,842 --> 00:24:12,139
Your Majesty.

273
00:24:12,306 --> 00:24:14,494
Your Majesty.
The King's in Council!

274
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,621
Arrange for the conveyance
of our tapestries.

275
00:24:17,043 --> 00:24:18,532
Yes, Your Majesty.

276
00:24:21,112 --> 00:24:22,669
I apologize, Your Majesty.

277
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:26,433
Come.

278
00:24:30,593 --> 00:24:33,327
- Katherine, you silly-
- I have missed my bleeding.

279
00:24:34,237 --> 00:24:35,724
I believe I am with child.

280
00:24:40,585 --> 00:24:42,185
My sweet sweetheart...

281
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:48,932
I had to tell Your Majesty.
I am sorry I made you angry.

282
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:52,449
I'm not angry. How could I
be any bit angry? God forbid.

283
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,714
Katherine, listen to me,
listen to me. Listen to me.

284
00:24:56,931 --> 00:24:58,498
For the sake of our child,

285
00:24:59,187 --> 00:25:01,238
please, girl, don't excite yourself.

286
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:03,460
Go and lay down.

287
00:25:03,865 --> 00:25:04,865
Rest,

288
00:25:05,219 --> 00:25:07,515
and I will come
and see you very, very soon.

289
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,317
God bless you.

290
00:25:14,093 --> 00:25:14,919
Go.

291
00:25:30,388 --> 00:25:31,988
My beautiful young Queen.

292
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:34,858
Go.

293
00:25:52,992 --> 00:25:54,342
How is my father?

294
00:25:54,626 --> 00:25:57,357
The King, having recovered
from his recent illness,

295
00:25:57,524 --> 00:25:59,566
seems in much better humor, My Lady.

296
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,733
He is planning to make a progress
to the North of England.

297
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,293
A great deal of work
is already instigated.

298
00:26:11,107 --> 00:26:14,791
They say that embroiderers
are working on furniture

299
00:26:15,256 --> 00:26:18,756
using copes and ornaments
stripped from the churches, alas.

300
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:21,455
Excellency.

301
00:26:22,985 --> 00:26:24,118
Thank you, Madam.

302
00:26:42,488 --> 00:26:43,985
There is another reason

303
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,296
why the King's humor is improved.

304
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:49,132
There are rumors.

305
00:26:49,573 --> 00:26:51,838
The Queen
is thought to be with child.

306
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,442
I'm sure His Majesty
would be overjoyed

307
00:26:58,609 --> 00:27:00,470
if she produced a Duke of York.

308
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:02,162
On the other hand,

309
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,008
if she does not,

310
00:27:05,003 --> 00:27:08,835
then the succession may,
in fact, remain an open question.

311
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:10,424
What do you mean?

312
00:27:11,468 --> 00:27:14,865
Surely Edward is first in line?
Who could doubt it?

313
00:27:15,526 --> 00:27:16,526
Lady Mary,

314
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,582
certain important people
at court have told me

315
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,272
they feel a "scruple" Of conscience

316
00:27:23,584 --> 00:27:25,352
over the fact
that Prince Edward's mother,

317
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,870
Queen Jane, was never
ever formally crowned,

318
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:31,404
unlike your own mother,
Queen Catherine.

319
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:34,715
So the rumor also goes,
that the King intends to crown

320
00:27:34,882 --> 00:27:37,530
his new Queen at York,
so if she has a son

321
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:41,373
no one can question his
legitimacy or right to the throne.

322
00:27:44,564 --> 00:27:46,665
But if she does not have a son...

323
00:27:47,172 --> 00:27:48,172
Exactly.

324
00:27:48,975 --> 00:27:51,608
It would strengthen
your own claim to the crown.

325
00:27:56,316 --> 00:27:59,962
Which is why these certain people
have assured me how they pray,

326
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:02,585
pray, not only for the overthrow

327
00:28:02,752 --> 00:28:06,351
of vile reformers like Hertford,
but for the day and the hour

328
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,018
that Your Grace
succeeds to the throne.

329
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:13,358
Only if God wills it, Excellency.

330
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,709
Only if God wills it.

331
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:17,713
But He must will it, Lady Mary.

332
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:21,676
For how else will this country
ever be restored to obedience

333
00:28:22,028 --> 00:28:23,178
and to faith?

334
00:28:24,031 --> 00:28:25,781
Otherwise, as things are,

335
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:28,319
it will go to the devil.

336
00:28:36,144 --> 00:28:38,244
Tell me more about the progress.

337
00:28:38,657 --> 00:28:39,962
Where shall we go?

338
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:41,971
First to Hatfield,

339
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:45,703
then to Dunstable,
Ampthill, and Grafton,

340
00:28:46,362 --> 00:28:48,367
hunting and hawking along the way.

341
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,015
Then to Stamford,

342
00:28:51,503 --> 00:28:52,651
and then Lincoln,

343
00:28:53,647 --> 00:28:55,759
and so on to Boston and Yorkshire.

344
00:28:56,779 --> 00:28:58,677
You'll have to have
plenty of new dresses made,

345
00:28:58,844 --> 00:29:01,678
for there will be many great
occasions and banquets along the way,

346
00:29:02,106 --> 00:29:04,781
and great crowds will come
to see your magnificence.

347
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,609
I'm so excited.

348
00:29:08,348 --> 00:29:10,109
All of this seems to me
still like a dream,

349
00:29:10,276 --> 00:29:12,250
from which I hope never to wake!

350
00:29:15,384 --> 00:29:17,436
Will you come to my
bedchamber tonight?

351
00:29:17,603 --> 00:29:18,856
No, sweetheart.

352
00:29:19,436 --> 00:29:22,260
It's too dangerous.
Not while you're with child.

353
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,190
What's the matter?

354
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:31,742
You are with child?

355
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,250
I was mistaken.

356
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,653
I miss...

357
00:29:51,272 --> 00:29:52,272
My Lady?

358
00:29:55,582 --> 00:29:56,582
My Lady?

359
00:30:10,988 --> 00:30:12,954
<i>Master Culpepper,</i>

360
00:30:15,718 --> 00:30:18,919
<i>I heartily recommend me</i>

361
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,826
<i>unto you...</i>

362
00:30:21,522 --> 00:30:25,246
<i>Praying you send me word
how that you do.</i>

363
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:29,536
<i>I would you were with me now</i>

364
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,623
<i>that you might see what pain I take</i>

365
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,273
<i>in writing to you.</i>

366
00:30:35,892 --> 00:30:37,602
"I heard that you were sick.

367
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:41,348
And never longed so much
for anything as to see you."

368
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:45,507
"It makes my heart die to think
I can't always be in your company."

369
00:30:47,815 --> 00:30:49,600
<i>It makes my heart die</i>

370
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,643
<i>to think I cannot always
be in your company.</i>

371
00:30:55,205 --> 00:30:58,292
<i>Yours... as long as life endures,</i>

372
00:30:59,004 --> 00:31:00,004
Katherine.

373
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:03,029
It's not her fault, she's so young.

374
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,401
No. That is her fault.

375
00:32:48,804 --> 00:32:50,004
You play well.

376
00:32:50,171 --> 00:32:52,286
You didn't used to, I remember.

377
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,931
And I never used to drink wine,
or play music.

378
00:32:57,321 --> 00:32:59,561
Now I do all those things...

379
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,820
and I like to do it.
I am free, and I like to do it.

380
00:33:06,587 --> 00:33:08,361
May I come to your bed tonight?

381
00:33:20,014 --> 00:33:23,924
I'm here now.
I don't want your heart to die.

382
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,959
You feel so sweet.

383
00:33:43,241 --> 00:33:44,791
My sweet little fool.

384
00:33:52,586 --> 00:33:53,636
I love you.

385
00:34:08,853 --> 00:34:10,053
You mustn't...

386
00:34:11,173 --> 00:34:12,173
You know?

387
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:15,933
I won't.

388
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,263
I promise.

389
00:35:31,733 --> 00:35:32,630
Your Majesty,

390
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,930
Lady Bryan.

391
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:40,043
Your Majesty. My Lord.

392
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,821
Here is your son, Prince Edward.

393
00:35:47,685 --> 00:35:50,119
Your Majesty. Uncle.

394
00:35:50,627 --> 00:35:51,677
Your Grace.

395
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:08,623
Edward.

396
00:36:10,266 --> 00:36:13,774
I trust you are well looked after
and everybody is kind to you.

397
00:36:13,941 --> 00:36:14,941
Yes, sir.

398
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:20,362
I have a gift for you.

399
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,063
Thank you, Your Majesty.

400
00:36:37,604 --> 00:36:39,995
I have to go away
from London for a while.

401
00:36:40,614 --> 00:36:42,283
But your uncle will stay here.

402
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:48,168
He is to be kept warm and well
at Windsor, Lady Bryan.

403
00:36:48,794 --> 00:36:51,527
And if, heaven forbid,
you should fall ill,

404
00:36:52,344 --> 00:36:53,794
dose him with this.

405
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:56,172
It's my own concoction.

406
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:07,083
I can see your mother in you.

407
00:37:09,285 --> 00:37:11,037
Do you know who she was?

408
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,111
This is her.

409
00:37:23,567 --> 00:37:25,267
And this is her thimble.

410
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,070
You're a good boy.

411
00:37:50,804 --> 00:37:52,104
Your sword, sir.

412
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:20,691
Your Majesty.

413
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,009
My Lady, the King is here.

414
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:28,075
Katherine, I've come to tell you that
we are leaving Whitehall in 2 days time.

415
00:38:28,242 --> 00:38:29,759
I trust you are prepared.

416
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,727
Yes, Your Majesty.

417
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:34,654
I've also come to tell you,

418
00:38:34,821 --> 00:38:37,659
- the Lady Mary will be accompanying us.
- Why?

419
00:38:39,998 --> 00:38:41,068
Must she come?

420
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:46,049
Obviously you don't understand.

421
00:38:46,216 --> 00:38:48,075
Mary is a much-loved
figure in the North,

422
00:38:48,342 --> 00:38:50,792
where we mean to impress
our subjects.

423
00:38:51,899 --> 00:38:54,004
The decision has
nothing to do with you.

424
00:38:58,376 --> 00:38:59,879
I'm sorry I was not with child.

425
00:39:05,163 --> 00:39:06,613
I am sure I can be.

426
00:39:38,435 --> 00:39:39,435
<i>Lift it!</i>

427
00:39:42,072 --> 00:39:43,247
<i>Keep moving!</i>

428
00:39:44,518 --> 00:39:46,593
-<i> Gather it up!
- Hay up!</i>

429
00:39:50,413 --> 00:39:51,413
<i>Boy!</i>

430
00:39:59,228 --> 00:40:01,169
<i>Keep in line! Fall in!</i>

431
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,230
<i>You there!</i>

432
00:40:19,297 --> 00:40:20,847
<i>Keep moving!</i>

433
00:40:25,355 --> 00:40:26,705
<i>There's the King!</i>

434
00:40:28,952 --> 00:40:31,352
- The King!
- Lady Mary and the King!

435
00:41:06,578 --> 00:41:08,715
You see how much they love us?

436
00:41:09,449 --> 00:41:11,595
These are the real people
of England.

437
00:41:11,937 --> 00:41:13,346
They love their King.

438
00:41:26,273 --> 00:41:28,123
His Grace, Bishop Gardiner.

439
00:41:29,002 --> 00:41:32,200
My Lord. I trust
I am not disturbing you.

440
00:41:32,505 --> 00:41:35,299
I know you bear a heavy burden,
in His Majesty's absence.

441
00:41:35,466 --> 00:41:37,161
Your Grace is most welcome.

442
00:41:37,522 --> 00:41:40,622
- How goes the King's progress?
- Most excellently.

443
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:44,377
He has been graciously received
everywhere. And he has had good sport.

444
00:41:44,929 --> 00:41:48,714
Just last week he and his companions
shot over four hundred deer in two days.

445
00:41:49,222 --> 00:41:50,468
They're going to Lincoln.

446
00:41:50,635 --> 00:41:54,135
I am very glad to hear
His Majesty is in such good spirits.

447
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,138
I suppose...

448
00:41:56,643 --> 00:42:00,309
he would number among his companions
the Earl of Surrey.

449
00:42:02,591 --> 00:42:03,714
Yes, for certain.

450
00:42:03,881 --> 00:42:05,281
- My Lord.
- Why?

451
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:08,873
I have received more reports
of the Earl's behavior.

452
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:14,035
It seems that, after his investiture
into the Order of the Garter,

453
00:42:14,202 --> 00:42:16,930
he appeared in a tavern
in his regalia

454
00:42:17,097 --> 00:42:20,329
and made great fun of the Order
and of those belonging to it.

455
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,807
Even before bawds and pimps.

456
00:42:25,268 --> 00:42:27,541
And these are sworn
statements of his behavior?

457
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:30,339
They are, my Lord.
Are you going to investigate further?

458
00:42:31,763 --> 00:42:32,863
Yes, I will.

459
00:42:33,254 --> 00:42:36,504
I am most grateful to Your Grace
for this information.

460
00:42:36,811 --> 00:42:39,181
I trust that someday
you will use it.

461
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,874
For I am as convinced as I can be

462
00:42:42,296 --> 00:42:45,461
that Surrey and his crew
flout the fasting laws

463
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:49,518
and are fanatic Lutherans
and Sacramentarians

464
00:42:50,204 --> 00:42:51,989
for which damnable heresies

465
00:42:52,156 --> 00:42:54,321
they ought to be burned
at Smithfield.

466
00:42:56,909 --> 00:42:57,959
Your Grace.

467
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:18,500
<i>Left, right, left, right,
left, right...</i>

468
00:44:44,422 --> 00:44:45,422
Henry,

469
00:44:46,076 --> 00:44:48,003
by the Grace of God,

470
00:44:48,448 --> 00:44:51,536
King of England,
Ireland, and France;

471
00:44:52,505 --> 00:44:55,196
also God's High Minister here,

472
00:44:55,884 --> 00:44:57,194
Head of His Church

473
00:44:58,024 --> 00:45:00,569
and soul of the whole kingdom.

474
00:45:01,858 --> 00:45:04,421
We beseech you in all humility

475
00:45:04,776 --> 00:45:08,122
to animate, rule
and save your people.

476
00:45:09,919 --> 00:45:13,411
And we further pray God,
of his infinite mercy,

477
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:18,170
that he will bless
and maintain in faith,

478
00:45:18,786 --> 00:45:21,204
in love, and in fecundity

479
00:45:21,918 --> 00:45:23,168
Queen Katherine

480
00:45:24,078 --> 00:45:25,878
and your blessed daughter,

481
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:28,142
Lady Mary.

482
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:31,186
Amen.

483
00:45:32,116 --> 00:45:33,116
Amen.

484
00:45:36,253 --> 00:45:37,403
Your Majesty.

485
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:10,330
People of Lincoln.

486
00:46:11,297 --> 00:46:12,994
Do I need to remind you

487
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,981
many of you here and about rose up

488
00:46:16,687 --> 00:46:20,087
in an unnatural and unlawful
rebellion against your King,

489
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,738
who you, by the laws of God,

490
00:46:23,397 --> 00:46:24,797
are bound to obey.

491
00:46:27,092 --> 00:46:28,092
Well,

492
00:46:29,273 --> 00:46:32,523
today we come here
for an altogether different reason.

493
00:46:33,493 --> 00:46:36,928
Today we come here
on a Pilgrimage of Forgiveness.

494
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,778
We are here to pardon

495
00:46:39,945 --> 00:46:43,195
all our subjects
for their past sins and disobedience.

496
00:46:44,019 --> 00:46:46,210
And since we have seen
how much you love us,

497
00:46:46,377 --> 00:46:49,146
and seen all your tokens
and signs of loyalty,

498
00:46:50,884 --> 00:46:52,284
with a free heart,

499
00:46:54,295 --> 00:46:55,354
we forgive you.

500
00:47:10,046 --> 00:47:12,162
<i>Here is Your Majesty's bedchamber.</i>

501
00:47:28,276 --> 00:47:29,527
Where does this go?

502
00:47:29,694 --> 00:47:31,341
To the stool chamber.

503
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:41,027
And that?

504
00:47:42,163 --> 00:47:43,563
To the backstairs.

505
00:47:46,122 --> 00:47:47,772
Come on! I want to see.

506
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:11,080
What's behind here?

507
00:48:11,754 --> 00:48:13,417
His Majesty's bedchamber.

508
00:48:13,584 --> 00:48:14,984
With his servants?

509
00:48:31,016 --> 00:48:32,451
It looks bad, doesn't it?

510
00:48:32,811 --> 00:48:35,718
I have seen it better, Your Majesty.
But I'll bathe it.

511
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,713
I wanted to visit the Queen tonight.

512
00:48:41,422 --> 00:48:44,948
She looked so pure and beautiful
in the cathedral today.

513
00:48:45,803 --> 00:48:47,000
Don't you think?

514
00:48:47,408 --> 00:48:48,926
You were both magnificent.

515
00:48:50,154 --> 00:48:52,279
And the people adored
and worshipped Your Majesty

516
00:48:52,446 --> 00:48:54,097
such as I have never seen the like.

517
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:04,525
Do you think the King's asleep yet?

518
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,433
He must be late.

519
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,150
It's almost midnight.

520
00:49:09,485 --> 00:49:10,585
Where is he?

521
00:49:25,747 --> 00:49:28,257
- He has gone to sleep.
- Go and fetch him.

522
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,103
- Hurry!
- Yes, my Lady.

523
00:49:32,265 --> 00:49:33,905
Help me change out of this.

524
00:49:52,164 --> 00:49:54,503
- Who's that?
- The night watchman.

525
00:49:56,384 --> 00:49:57,384
Come.

526
00:50:11,704 --> 00:50:12,948
I'll stay out here.

527
00:50:17,131 --> 00:50:18,581
I'll watch outside.

528
00:50:42,416 --> 00:50:43,516
Not in here!

529
00:50:44,326 --> 00:50:45,376
Where then?

530
00:50:51,346 --> 00:50:52,346
In here.

531
00:51:42,562 --> 00:51:43,712
Jesus Christ.
