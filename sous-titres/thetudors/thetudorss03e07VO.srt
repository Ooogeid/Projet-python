- Master Holbein!
- My Lord.

8
00:01:26,022 --> 00:01:28,357
I've... I've a commission for you.

9
00:01:28,658 --> 00:01:30,683
The Duke of Cleves has given
you permission

10
00:01:30,808 --> 00:01:33,094
to paint his daughter, Anne.
You should leave at once.

11
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:36,728
There're so many pressing things and
you've time to talk about a painting?

12
00:01:37,121 --> 00:01:38,706
This is no ordinary painting,

13
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:40,613
A great many things hang upon it.

14
00:01:40,814 --> 00:01:43,796
To that effect, however
you should find the lady,

15
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:45,732
whatever her actual appearance,

16
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:49,501
I pray you use your art and give her
at least a pleasing countent

17
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:51,863
Even if she is as ugly as sin?

18
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:54,355
I truly hope she is not so.

19
00:01:55,337 --> 00:01:58,655
But still, you wish me,
if necessary to lie?

20
00:01:59,557 --> 00:02:01,715
Surely, all art is a lie,

21
00:02:02,564 --> 00:02:03,671
master Holbein.

22
00:02:09,783 --> 00:02:12,624
My Lords, since the signing
of the Treaty of Toledo

23
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:15,014
Between the French king
and the Emperor

24
00:02:15,232 --> 00:02:17,432
There've been vital
and unavoidable signs

25
00:02:17,557 --> 00:02:20,523
of their mutual preparations for war
Against this realm.

26
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,559
You know in this how much they've
been urged on by the Vicar of Rome

27
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:26,892
and now we hear competent
reports of fleets

28
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:30,356
Gathering at Antwerp and Bologna.
And of an army of the Netherlands.

29
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,576
Furthermore, the French and Imperial
ambassadors

30
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:35,528
Have been recalled by their masters.

31
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,562
My Lords,

32
00:02:38,288 --> 00:02:40,825
we've not been idle
under such provocations

33
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:43,077
Defence forces have been mastered

34
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,480
and beacon set along the coast
for warning.

35
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,310
Work has also begun building

36
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:49,378
artillery forts facing
the English Channel.

37
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,479
In the North, we have strengthen
our borders against the Scots.

38
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:55,631
And His Majesty's fleet warships
has been provisioned.

39
00:02:56,188 --> 00:02:58,427
Foreign vessels are being forbidden
to leave these shores

40
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:00,274
without Royal permission.

41
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,527
My Lords.

42
00:03:07,997 --> 00:03:11,554
How can anyone doubt that the
Pope, that pestilent idol,

43
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,859
that enemy of truth,
the usurper of all princes,

44
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,338
is now conspiring
to corrupt England's religion

45
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:20,110
and strip her of her wealth.

46
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,697
My Lords, at such a time,

47
00:03:25,186 --> 00:03:27,516
it is good for me to be amongst
my people.

48
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,318
I'll visit all the places
where the barricades

49
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,652
and the defences
of the realm are being built

50
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,332
for the encouragement of my troops.

51
00:03:36,201 --> 00:03:37,715
And to my enemies' terror.

52
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,086
My Lords.

53
00:03:40,693 --> 00:03:41,720
Your Majesty.

54
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,900
It seems we are threatened
from everywhere, Sir Francis.

55
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,090
Scotland, Spain, the Low Countries.

56
00:03:56,746 --> 00:03:59,565
We are like a morsel among
these choppers.

57
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,425
I'll tell you something else.
According to Cromwell's agents,

58
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,525
Just two weeks ago, Cardinal Pole
left Rome in a secret mission.

59
00:04:06,231 --> 00:04:09,395
Shall we be after him again? As soon
as we've more news of his whereabouts,

60
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,558
we shall.

61
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,245
Sharpen your knives.

62
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,367
Your Grace.

63
00:04:18,802 --> 00:04:20,351
- My Lord.
- Can we talk?

64
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:23,100
- In private?
- Sometime. Not now.

65
00:04:28,097 --> 00:04:31,808
Mr. Holbein has sent this portrait
of Anne de Cleves,

66
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:33,273
your Majesty.

67
00:04:34,828 --> 00:04:36,056
She is pleasing.

68
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,619
Has our ambassador been able
to see her properly?

69
00:04:40,744 --> 00:04:44,737
Yes, Sir John has written to me in
great praise of the princesses person.

70
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:46,960
He writes, "she's incomparable

71
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,454
and excels the Duchess of Milan

72
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:51,750
as the golden sun excels
the silver moon".

73
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,561
Majesty,

74
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,215
if I may.

75
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:03,759
Marriage to the Duchess of Milan
is no longer an option.

76
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,703
Nor since the Emperor and the French
are in league against us.

77
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,947
Or any of the French women.

78
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,206
Your Majesty is beset by enemies.

79
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:18,241
Marriage to Anne of Cleves
would bring with it the military

80
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:21,193
and financial support
of the Protestant League.

81
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,930
What?

82
00:05:58,665 --> 00:06:00,268
- What's it?
- Enemy ships,

83
00:06:00,562 --> 00:06:01,970
flying the Black Eagle.

84
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:03,694
Give it a look.

85
00:06:09,855 --> 00:06:11,410
It's appeared on the ships.

86
00:06:11,948 --> 00:06:14,210
For Lord's sake!
Light the beacon!

87
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:17,538
Hurry!

88
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,710
Light it!

89
00:06:31,815 --> 00:06:32,876
God save us!

90
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,472
Duke William,

91
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:40,310
his Majesty is much taken
by the portrait of your sister, Anne.

92
00:06:40,654 --> 00:06:43,584
He encourages you to send ambassadors
to England

93
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,502
to conclude the negociations

94
00:06:45,627 --> 00:06:49,374
including the question of your
sister's dowry and so on.

95
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,711
Once again,

96
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:53,553
his Majesty is premature.

97
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,990
But surely, your highness...

98
00:06:58,246 --> 00:07:01,124
I think the king should come to me
publicly

99
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:02,609
And on bended knee

100
00:07:02,874 --> 00:07:04,833
to beg for my sister's hand.

101
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,900
And for the protection
of the League.

102
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,412
In any case,
Anne was already promised, formerly

103
00:07:12,271 --> 00:07:14,080
to the Duke of Lorraine's son.

104
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,594
And I don't see how I can break
that promise

105
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:18,933
- or keep my honor.
- Your highness,

106
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:21,436
if true, this is most unexpected

107
00:07:21,647 --> 00:07:23,526
and unwelcome news.

108
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,234
That is because you expected
from the start to have your way

109
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,938
with Cleves and my sister.

110
00:07:28,508 --> 00:07:31,531
But my country is not a brothel
and my sister is not a whore.

111
00:07:32,895 --> 00:07:33,895
Well...

112
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,252
If your master truly desires
to have an alliance,

113
00:07:45,144 --> 00:07:48,102
then he must demonstrate his respect
for my country...

114
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,183
and put a better price
on my sister's virginity.

115
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,640
Make way!

116
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,481
Thank you.

117
00:08:07,096 --> 00:08:08,096
Come on.

118
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:15,409
Message for His Majesty!

119
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,180
Majesty.

120
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,915
From Sir Thomas Chaining,
warden of the Sank Ports.

121
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,713
Your Majesty, Lords of the Council,

122
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,845
this morning we counted
68 Imperial ships in the Channel.

123
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:38,685
I sent out two ships and afterwards
my bowmen

124
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,684
were taken aboard
the Imperial flagship

125
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,835
and shown every courtesy
by the Admiral.

126
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,947
He said his fleet was bound
for Spain,

127
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:46,998
and not England.

128
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,160
That he meant no harm to either us
or our coast.

129
00:08:51,354 --> 00:08:53,572
If they doubt this word,
they ought to see

130
00:08:53,697 --> 00:08:55,401
How poorly armed the ships were.

131
00:08:55,526 --> 00:08:57,345
Quick more like merchantmen,

132
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,520
That hold both the provisions for
Emperor's voyage to Constantinople.

133
00:09:17,345 --> 00:09:19,424
The Imperial ambassador,
your majesty.

134
00:09:22,724 --> 00:09:24,425
I thought you'd been recalled.

135
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,631
There was some talk, your majesty.

136
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,971
But I had no desire to leave here,

137
00:09:29,457 --> 00:09:31,361
Not that I think
there was any cause.

138
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:32,652
Of course.

139
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:37,035
But your master and the French king
have formed an alliance against me.

140
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:40,791
There appears to have been preparations
for an invasion encouraged

141
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:42,767
by the Vicar of Rome.

142
00:09:43,202 --> 00:09:45,742
Your Majesty, I've been in this job
for a long time,

143
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,565
I know when to believe what I am told,
and when not to.

144
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,979
Which is most of the time.

145
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:56,381
Although the Emperor publicly embraced
the French king,

146
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,869
And even gave him the Order of
the Golden Fleece from around his neck,

147
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:02,116
He still continues to hate him.

148
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,977
More than any other enemy,
my master fears the Turks.

149
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:09,191
And yet the French are
in league with them.

150
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,882
How is such behavior from another
Christian Monarch to be forgiven?

151
00:10:15,152 --> 00:10:17,352
Then they are no longer
in the alliance?

152
00:10:18,255 --> 00:10:20,320
The accord has already broken down.

153
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,813
Which means that
the Duchess of Milan is

154
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:26,680
once more available for your
Majesties bed.

155
00:10:28,102 --> 00:10:30,446
It's to late, Mr. Chapuys.

156
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:32,462
Tell me,

157
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,939
am I to be relived that once more,
I've been used as a pawn in a game

158
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:38,141
between your master and
the French King?

159
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,567
I tell you this here and now,

160
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,108
I've had enough, Mr. Chapuys.

161
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,903
I've had enough.

162
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,001
You may leave.

163
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,005
I'm surprised to see you back
so soon, Excellences.

164
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,970
We have good news, your Highness.

165
00:11:21,274 --> 00:11:22,274
How so?

166
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,805
His Majesty so desires
to marry your sister, Anne,

167
00:11:26,077 --> 00:11:29,019
That he is willing to forfeit
the requirements of a dowry.

168
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:35,558
- He wants nothing?
- Only his new bride,

169
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:38,089
in the shorter time as possible.

170
00:11:38,855 --> 00:11:42,818
His Majesty will also pay
your Highness

171
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,285
a considerable stipend

172
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,364
for introducing him to the League.

173
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,521
However, we recall that your sister

174
00:11:51,646 --> 00:11:54,753
is already promised to the son
of the Duke of Lorraine.

175
00:11:55,463 --> 00:11:58,620
Yes, that was indeed
a great obstacle.

176
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,146
However, on closer consideration
we have discovered that

177
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,615
the contract was never ratified.

178
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,526
And so is not binding in law
or any other way.

179
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,150
So your sister is free
to marry the king?

180
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:20,495
I will send my ambassadors to England
to conclude the negociations.

181
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,782
Gentlemen.

182
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,460
What's this?

183
00:12:52,754 --> 00:12:56,273
Cromwell's agents, finally intercepted
a letter from Cardinal Pole.

184
00:12:56,812 --> 00:12:58,605
He was on his way to Rome.

185
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,630
I have managed to decode it.

186
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:02,446
May I see?

187
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:09,411
To Cardinal Von Waldburg.

188
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,785
Supposed to travel to Paris,
to meet King Francis.

189
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,303
Have already written,

190
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:17,945
telling him I found the Emperor
very sympathetic to my mission.

191
00:13:18,271 --> 00:13:19,871
But fear it is not so.

192
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,383
The Emperor fears the Turk
more than king Henry,

193
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:26,151
so I believe he will not act
against him.

194
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:27,679
So, postpone journey.

195
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,355
Will go instead to papal city
of Carpentras.

196
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,740
I wait further instructions
from his Holiness.

197
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,275
Have you ever been to Carpentras?

198
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,550
No...

199
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,400
but I'm dying to go.

200
00:13:49,905 --> 00:13:51,805
The Duke of Sufolk, My Lord.

201
00:13:52,742 --> 00:13:53,830
Your Grace.

202
00:13:54,517 --> 00:13:56,337
To what do I owe this honor?

203
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:59,878
I'm here to congratulate you.
The king has made you Earl of Hartford.

204
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:02,961
And I believe it is time to patch up

205
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:05,628
our past quarrels and difficulties.

206
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:08,011
We have better quarrels to be added.

207
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,265
I am happy to agree with your grace.

208
00:14:13,838 --> 00:14:15,288
- Drink?
- Please.

209
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,900
Please.

210
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,510
I am commanded to meet
the Princess at Calais.

211
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,205
Great, many things hang up
on this marriage, do they not?

212
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,085
The King's happiness, for one.

213
00:14:40,072 --> 00:14:42,709
And my Lord Cromwell's reputation.

214
00:14:45,546 --> 00:14:47,746
What a pity if all should go awry.

215
00:14:51,218 --> 00:14:53,268
I would have pity for the King.

216
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,960
But on the other hand?

217
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,827
- Salut!
- Salut!

218
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,240
So, he is marrying
a Lutheran heretic?

219
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:10,699
- So it seems.
- And I shall marry no one?!

220
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,703
- My lady... I...
- No, I prefer it.

221
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:18,795
Do you suppose I'd like
to be married off to the Dukes brother,

222
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,920
or some heretic cousin of his?

223
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,890
I would prefer to live in a nunnery.

224
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,062
Like, you don't know
what to think of the King,

225
00:15:29,187 --> 00:15:32,087
He burns one Lucifer,
and then marries another?

226
00:15:35,573 --> 00:15:38,726
If God so wills it,
she might drown at sea.

227
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,001
Chequers, Calais
English Occupied France.

228
00:16:04,128 --> 00:16:05,061
Gentlemen,

229
00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:08,705
we bid you welcome to Calais
on this most auspicious occasion.

230
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:10,381
"Danke."

231
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,335
May I present to you, His Grace,
the Duke of Suffolk.

232
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,160
Your Grace, I'm honored.

233
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,080
I am Herr Hoghesten,

234
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:25,982
and this is Count Olisleger.

235
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,470
"Hallo!"

236
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,040
And here, is she,

237
00:16:30,571 --> 00:16:32,638
Her Highness Princess Anne.

238
00:16:33,398 --> 00:16:35,825
After a long time, my God!

239
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,700
Your Highness.

240
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,670
Good day, your Grace.

241
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:28,043
I'm afraid the bad weather will prevent
our sailing for a few days.

242
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,754
I understand.

243
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:39,463
Perhaps your Grace could...

244
00:17:40,424 --> 00:17:43,478
help me to explain
how the English are eating?

245
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:46,347
Of course.

246
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,721
And maybe...

247
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:51,852
show me some things
the king likes to do?

248
00:17:56,698 --> 00:17:59,814
His Majesty likes to play cards
and gamble.

249
00:18:01,024 --> 00:18:03,019
- Do you play?
- No.

250
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:07,194
I think, only the men play the cards
in my country.

251
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:11,723
And, is it not bad to gamble?

252
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,344
Only if you can afford to lose.

253
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,480
We'll play Piquet,
it's not hard to learn.

254
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,927
Das ist gut.

255
00:18:19,294 --> 00:18:22,793
There are 4 suits of cards.

256
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,648
Spades, clubs,

257
00:18:26,454 --> 00:18:28,556
diamonds and hearts.

258
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,750
Hearts? You play with hearts?

259
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,861
Sometimes.

260
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,386
And here we have aces, kings,

261
00:18:40,761 --> 00:18:43,043
queens and knaves.

262
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,330
Then all the Court is here, ja?

263
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,280
Does the king always win?

264
00:18:58,099 --> 00:18:59,760
His Majesty does not like losing.

265
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,356
What have they told you
about the king?

266
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,630
Why?

267
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,910
What is it I should know?

268
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:28,079
Carpentras
Papal Enclave of Venaissin

269
00:19:29,183 --> 00:19:32,007
- You are Francis Bryan?
- You can take us to the Cardinal?

270
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:35,410
Si. Yes. Come quickly.
He is with us.

271
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,600
Where is the bastard?

272
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,590
Sorry senor.

273
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,160
Prego,

274
00:20:19,126 --> 00:20:21,518
go with God my sons.

275
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,790
We'll never catch him.

276
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,840
It's a waste of time.

277
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,240
Perhaps not.

278
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,092
Holy Mary pray for us...

279
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,532
and deliver me from my ennemies

280
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,642
Amen.

281
00:21:19,652 --> 00:21:21,902
- You didn't see her face?
- No Your Majesty.

282
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,435
But she plays cards as pleasantly

283
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,282
and with as good a grace
as any other noble woman.

284
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,696
She's come to Rochester.

285
00:21:30,196 --> 00:21:32,646
I'm due to meet her
in three days time.

286
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,522
I tell you I'm more impatient
than ever to see her.

287
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,480
What of Sir Francis Bryan?

288
00:21:40,847 --> 00:21:43,345
He and Sir Thomas Seymour are now
to Carpentras.

289
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,220
Where Cardinal Pole is supposed
to be hiding.

290
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,580
It appears he has grown fearful
of assassination.

291
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:52,391
He's every right to be so.

292
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:56,781
I swear that man should be flamed alive
and I should wear his skin as a shirt.

293
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:01,149
He will doom the day he allowed the Pope
to use and to threaten me.

294
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,250
I tell you,
I cannot abide this waiting.

295
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,511
It's been a long time.

296
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,760
I need to nourish love.

297
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:16,456
- I can understand.
- Can you?

298
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,950
I want to possess this woman

299
00:22:23,424 --> 00:22:25,324
And I haven't even seen her.

300
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:28,421
She's a complete stranger to me.

301
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:34,993
What if I can't?

302
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:41,462
What if you can't... what?

303
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,720
Broom.

304
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,216
- Majesty.
- Fetch the master of the horse,

305
00:22:47,341 --> 00:22:49,517
I live for Rochester immediately.
Go!

306
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:26,172
Make way!

307
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,360
Dismount!

308
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:42,959
Tell the lady a gentleman has come
to see her, bearing a New Year's gift.

309
00:24:55,054 --> 00:24:57,404
I'm here to welcome you to my realm.

310
00:24:58,792 --> 00:25:00,942
I trust you are comfortable here?

311
00:25:02,907 --> 00:25:06,884
Before your journey to London.

312
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,226
Thank you, Your Majesty.

313
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,930
I'll see you in London.

314
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:44,299
I should have taken more
lessons from the Duke.

315
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,430
English manners are very
different from ours.

316
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:08,670
I like her not!
Do you understand me?

317
00:26:09,575 --> 00:26:10,825
I like her not!

318
00:26:11,357 --> 00:26:12,984
Call a meeting of the Council.

319
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,320
It seems, that Princes in marriage
suffer more then poor men.

320
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,764
Since they have to take
what is brought to them,

321
00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:27,389
while poor man are
at liberty to choose.

322
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,830
I have been deceived
about Anne of Cleves.

323
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,438
She is nothing like
what was reported to me. Nothing!

324
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,440
She looks like a horse!

325
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:40,442
A furless mare!

326
00:26:46,617 --> 00:26:49,437
Your Majesty will remember
that it was Sir John

327
00:26:49,617 --> 00:26:51,405
who described her as being like a...

328
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:54,640
I never saw her properly,
which was not my fault.

329
00:26:54,765 --> 00:26:56,730
I carried out my commission
as best I could,

330
00:26:56,855 --> 00:26:59,790
and I told you I was no good
with women.

331
00:26:59,915 --> 00:27:01,265
My Lord Cromwell.

332
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:04,728
Do you deny
that you spoke to me of her beauty?

333
00:27:05,064 --> 00:27:07,135
Of the desirability
of my marriage to her?

334
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,582
No. Your Majesty.

335
00:27:08,707 --> 00:27:11,541
And if I had misled your Majesty
and His Council

336
00:27:11,666 --> 00:27:14,879
by commendations based on false reports,
then, I am truly sorry for them.

337
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:18,794
If I had known what I know now,
she would never have been brought here!

338
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:21,552
What remedy Mr. Cromwell?

339
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,265
Your Majesty have to say
that there is none.

340
00:27:30,552 --> 00:27:34,519
That's the case, you've been following
the Cleves agenda since the beginning.

341
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Go on.

342
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,419
Today, the Emperor is the guest
of the King of France.

343
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,960
They have renewed their alliance.

344
00:27:47,742 --> 00:27:50,542
If we now reject our German allies,
then England will remain alone

345
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:54,026
and friendless and at the mercy
of the King and Emperor.

346
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:57,935
Your Majesty, if you break this
marriage contract now

347
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,713
you risk the possibility that even
Duke William himself

348
00:28:00,885 --> 00:28:02,348
might retaliate against us.

349
00:28:13,922 --> 00:28:17,571
I am sorry that your Majesty has
no better contempt.

350
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,460
I'm not well handled, Sir Cromwell.

351
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,670
Majesty.

352
00:29:33,441 --> 00:29:34,441
Milady.

353
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,390
I am here to welcome you
to what is yours.

354
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:47,595
Your Majesty is very gracious
and I am very happy.

355
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,422
My daughters, Princess Mary...

356
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,700
The Princess Elizabeth.

357
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:28,856
For you... I think they are pretty.

358
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:33,328
Thank you Princess.
I think you are pretty too.

359
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,730
I shall love them both.

360
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,360
I like her not.

361
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:14,780
But it seems
Your Majesty must marry her.

362
00:31:14,905 --> 00:31:16,705
Who says I must? Cromwell?

363
00:31:17,931 --> 00:31:19,623
I have my lawyers working on it.

364
00:31:20,216 --> 00:31:22,910
The betrothed can be prevented
on two grounds:

365
00:31:23,035 --> 00:31:25,503
Either the German envoy fails to bring
the commission from the Duke

366
00:31:25,628 --> 00:31:28,755
authorizing them to conclude
the legalities of the marriage,

367
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,593
Or they can't provide
written evidence

368
00:31:30,718 --> 00:31:34,696
that her betrothed was formerly
revoked. Either way I can get out of it.

369
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,610
I wish in my heart that your majesty
is successful.

370
00:31:41,427 --> 00:31:45,391
It seems to me that my lord Cromwell
is to keen to stress there's no remedy.

371
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,790
The marriage was his idea.

372
00:31:49,005 --> 00:31:50,905
There were other candidates.

373
00:31:51,031 --> 00:31:54,324
The Duchess of Milan is supposed to be
the most desirable woman in the world!

374
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,201
Instead of which...

375
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,230
Perhaps, in this matter,
Lord Cromwell...

376
00:32:04,124 --> 00:32:05,928
has overreached himself.

377
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,050
Perhaps.

378
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,235
Oh God!

379
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,710
If there is no remedy I must put
my neck into this yoke.

380
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,056
I'm sorry Lord Cromwell,
I didn't see you, I...

381
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,160
I was talking to God.

382
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,399
But surely say you have to go
to church for that.

383
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,520
Do you understand nothing
about Reforms?

384
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:18,279
God is not just in church, he is...
everywhere.

385
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,961
We do not need priests
to speak for us.

386
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:25,414
We can... speak to Him ourselves,

387
00:33:25,841 --> 00:33:27,758
and He will listen.

388
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,963
There's no need for bells,
and books and candles.

389
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:36,411
All you need is... your soul.

390
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,065
Now go away. Think.

391
00:33:50,175 --> 00:33:51,066
Wait!

392
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,940
Today is the fifth of the Epiphany,

393
00:34:47,594 --> 00:34:49,044
and my wedding day.

394
00:34:50,915 --> 00:34:53,498
So, there is no legal remedy?

395
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:57,742
None that it was possible to discover,
Your Majesty.

396
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:02,519
I am not well handled.

397
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,430
I think when Your Majesty gets to know
the lady better...

398
00:35:07,685 --> 00:35:10,275
I don't want to know
the lady better Mr Cromwell!

399
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,980
The notion of it repulses me.

400
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:21,610
My Lord, if it were not to satisfy
the world and my realm,

401
00:35:21,735 --> 00:35:25,285
I would not do what I must do this day
for no earthly thing!

402
00:37:57,327 --> 00:37:58,627
Shall we to bed?

403
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,540
Majesty.

404
00:41:21,831 --> 00:41:24,181
How does
Your Majesty like the Queen?

405
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:30,151
My Lord, I didn't like her very much
before, I like her much worse now.

406
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:33,490
She is nothing fair
and has evil smells about her.

407
00:41:34,504 --> 00:41:38,465
She's no maid because of the looseness
of her breasts and other tokens.

408
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:42,090
So I had neither the will
nor the courage to prove the rest.

409
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:45,281
I have no appetite
for unpleasant airs.

410
00:41:46,644 --> 00:41:48,625
I left her as good a maid
as I found her.

411
00:41:49,657 --> 00:41:53,292
And now my Lord, leave me.
I'm very busy.

412
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,500
Speak out!

413
00:42:34,215 --> 00:42:36,915
- I couldn't sleep. Who is there?
- No one.

414
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,837
Go back to bed.
Should I come to you later?

415
00:42:42,913 --> 00:42:45,363
If you could still be
my sweet Charles.

416
00:42:45,488 --> 00:42:47,267
I am as good as I may be.

417
00:42:48,145 --> 00:42:49,960
Can't you take me as I am?

418
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,370
I love you Catherine.

419
00:43:10,106 --> 00:43:13,632
I have drained to the pus
from Your Majesty's wound.

420
00:43:14,757 --> 00:43:17,207
Your Majesty should feel
no more pain.

421
00:43:18,246 --> 00:43:19,340
I expede to God.

422
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,530
Forgive me,

423
00:43:30,469 --> 00:43:33,419
but is Your Majesty troubled by...
other things?

424
00:43:37,943 --> 00:43:40,987
I have been unabled to consumate
my marriage with Lady Anne.

425
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:44,520
I find her body in such a sort,

426
00:43:46,326 --> 00:43:48,126
disordered and indisposed,

427
00:43:49,343 --> 00:43:51,831
that it doesn't excite me
or provoke any lust in me.

428
00:43:55,595 --> 00:43:57,378
Have you heard any rumors of it?

429
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:00,060
Not at all, Your Majesty.

430
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:04,440
It has not anything to do
with my virility.

431
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,137
Indeed, these last nights,
I have had

432
00:44:07,524 --> 00:44:09,837
pollutione and nocturne in somno.

433
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,200
Two nocturnal emissions...

434
00:44:13,463 --> 00:44:17,219
You see, I know myself perfectly able
to... perform the act with others,

435
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,360
just not with her.

436
00:44:21,913 --> 00:44:25,913
With her I have no appetite to do
what a man should do with his wife.

437
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,490
- My Lord Cromwell?
- Majesty.

438
00:44:58,026 --> 00:44:59,476
May we speak alone?

439
00:45:00,386 --> 00:45:01,386
Alone?

440
00:45:03,904 --> 00:45:06,144
Oh, yeah. Of course.

441
00:45:12,606 --> 00:45:13,606
My Lord.

442
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:19,627
Madam, I've come on a delicate matter,
forgive me.

443
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,840
I... must warn you
againt antagonizing the King.

444
00:45:26,588 --> 00:45:29,670
I must remind you
of the expediency of doing your utmost

445
00:45:30,138 --> 00:45:31,848
to make yourself agreable... to him.

446
00:45:32,016 --> 00:45:33,016
Sir...

447
00:45:33,553 --> 00:45:36,644
I am not sure
how I given His Majesty offence.

448
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:43,858
It is in your interest and in mine

449
00:45:43,983 --> 00:45:46,237
to make your marriage to the King
a sucess.

450
00:45:47,356 --> 00:45:49,206
If for example, you were...

451
00:45:49,331 --> 00:45:51,975
to find yourself,
quick with child...

452
00:45:57,168 --> 00:46:00,034
I'm sorry to talk
in such intimate matters, but...

453
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,980
You are the Queen of England, you have
nothing private anymore.

454
00:46:06,155 --> 00:46:08,669
How am I to become quick with child

455
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,333
when the king leaves me a maid?

456
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,350
I am not the Virgin Mary!

457
00:46:16,412 --> 00:46:19,132
You say I have nothing private,

458
00:46:19,842 --> 00:46:22,192
Then I say you
it is not all pleasing.

459
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:26,729
I would do anything the King wants,
but sometimes,

460
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,488
The score on his leg is bad.

461
00:46:30,949 --> 00:46:32,599
It oczes blood and pus.

462
00:46:32,847 --> 00:46:34,047
And it smells.

463
00:46:34,586 --> 00:46:37,131
It stinks. It smells, yeah?

464
00:46:38,047 --> 00:46:39,206
You understand?

465
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:44,739
Now, I am sorry, My Lord.

466
00:46:46,381 --> 00:46:47,531
I will go on,

467
00:46:48,089 --> 00:46:51,639
doing all that I can to make myself
agreable to His Majesty.

468
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,560
He is always gracious and kind.

469
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:08,270
Majesty.

470
00:47:26,416 --> 00:47:28,516
Madam, how do you find the king?

471
00:47:29,496 --> 00:47:30,496
Why,

472
00:47:30,706 --> 00:47:33,637
he is most kind and solicitousness,
Lady Bryan.

473
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,590
When he comes to bed, he kisses me.

474
00:47:39,751 --> 00:47:42,922
Takes my hand,
bids me "good night sweetheart".

475
00:47:43,925 --> 00:47:46,525
Then, in the morning,
he kisses me again.

476
00:47:47,516 --> 00:47:49,366
And says: farewell darling.

477
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,115
My lady,
we all hope you'll be with child soon.

478
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:58,340
I know very well, I am not.

479
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:03,000
But, how do you know you are not?

480
00:48:03,808 --> 00:48:05,759
I know it well, I am not.

481
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:13,008
I think
your Majesty is a maid still.

482
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,040
He must put his member inside you
and stir it.

483
00:48:23,689 --> 00:48:26,570
Or else we'll not have a Duke of York,
which is all this realm desires.

484
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,315
I am contented Lady Bryan.

485
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:32,920
I received as much
of the king's attention as I wish.

486
00:48:33,045 --> 00:48:34,295
I know no more!

487
00:48:53,969 --> 00:48:55,019
Lady Bryan?

488
00:48:56,731 --> 00:48:58,131
Yes, Your Majesty.

489
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,860
If I don't please the king...

490
00:49:04,618 --> 00:49:05,918
will he kill me?
