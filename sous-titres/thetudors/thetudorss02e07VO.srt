00:00:00,161 --> 00:00:01,548
Previously on The Tudors...

2
00:00:01,788 --> 00:00:03,465
your Holy Father offers you

3
00:00:03,706 --> 00:00:06,535
his tears of grief and his anger

4
00:00:06,695 --> 00:00:09,035
at the martyrdom of Sir Thomas More

5
00:00:09,195 --> 00:00:10,557
and Cardinal Fisher.

6
00:00:10,797 --> 00:00:13,262
- How is my mother?
- Alas, she is very unwell.

7
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:15,895
She is sinking, but always begs
the King of his mercy to

8
00:00:16,135 --> 00:00:18,982
- be allowed to see you.
- I am sure he will one day relent.

9
00:00:19,222 --> 00:00:21,618
I believe that he still
loves and cares for me.

10
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:24,050
I am unable to give a King a son.

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,467
So long as Mary is alive,
she could be Queen.

12
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:31,273
Your daughter will be made
heir of the throne.

13
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:33,714
But the King can change his mind.

14
00:00:33,874 --> 00:00:36,995
If Elizabeth was betrothed
to King Francis' son,

15
00:00:37,155 --> 00:00:40,337
then her legitimacy would no longer
be questioned by anyone.

16
00:00:40,577 --> 00:00:43,452
I still do not blame the King.
He's been seduced by witchcraft.

17
00:00:43,572 --> 00:00:45,018
That is why she must die.

18
00:00:45,138 --> 00:00:48,600
Your sister is a very beautiful woman.
Not as beautiful as her brother.

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,509
I came on behalf of My Lady.

20
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:53,494
If you still have feelings for me,
you would speak out for her.

21
00:00:53,614 --> 00:00:54,683
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:54,803 --> 00:00:57,409
How is your survey of the
religious houses progressing?

23
00:00:57,569 --> 00:01:01,225
They have found the monks and
many places so depraved and so corrupt

24
00:01:01,385 --> 00:01:04,498
that your commissioners already despair
of any perfect reformation.

25
00:01:04,658 --> 00:01:06,904
In Nuremberg,
clergy are allowed to marry.

26
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:09,741
It won't do his career much good here.
Being illegal.

27
00:01:09,982 --> 00:01:13,536
I regret now what happened to More.
A certain person would privately

28
00:01:13,776 --> 00:01:15,421
urge me on to his destruction.

29
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:17,254
You know who she is, Charles.

30
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:20,676
His Majesty consent to
the betrothal of the Dauphin

31
00:01:21,343 --> 00:01:22,638
... to Lady Mary.

32
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:25,001
- Francis won't accept the betrothal.
- Why?

33
00:01:25,161 --> 00:01:27,990
Because the Pope and he and the Emperor

34
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,344
all agree she is a bastard!

35
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:32,471
And you are not my wife!

36
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:34,537
This is all I know of Mary

37
00:01:34,697 --> 00:01:36,600
that she is my death

38
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:39,030
... and I am hers.

44
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,889
Your Majesty.

45
00:05:51,387 --> 00:05:53,169
- Gentlemen.
- Your Majesty.

46
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:56,627
What's this?

47
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:58,589
"The Valor Ecclesiasticus."

48
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:00,961
the results of the Commissioner's
investigations

49
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:03,660
into the wealth and practices
of all the religious houses

50
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,393
in Your Majesty's kingdom.

51
00:06:05,513 --> 00:06:08,170
It lists the treasures, the wealth and

52
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,864
the vast private lands
of the monasteries, priories

53
00:06:12,024 --> 00:06:14,280
and other religious establishments.

54
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,720
It as well lists the innumerable
cases of laxity,

55
00:06:18,714 --> 00:06:20,014
corruption,

56
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:21,970
evil practice and fraud

57
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,879
which have flourished, unchecked,
and in some cases

58
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,809
for hundreds of years,
in these same institutions.

59
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,258
Meanwhile, Majesty,

60
00:06:37,378 --> 00:06:39,754
your own treasury is much depleted.

61
00:06:39,914 --> 00:06:41,680
Is it not a thing to marvel at,

62
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,651
the richness of those who ought
by right to be your subjects,

63
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:48,035
and the poverty and debt
of the English Crown?

64
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,483
It is, indeed.

65
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:16,970
George.

66
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:21,601
- Sir Henry.
- Your Majesty.

67
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:23,948
I came again to
pay court to Lady Sheldon,

68
00:07:24,188 --> 00:07:25,783
with the King's permission.

69
00:07:26,023 --> 00:07:27,740
- Yes. Yes, of course.
- I...

70
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:30,589
I also wanted an opportunity to express

71
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:32,842
my love and devotion to Your Majesty.

72
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:34,958
As a reformer myself,

73
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,445
I know all the good works you do,
without ever

74
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:40,214
seeking any praise,
but always deserving it.

75
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:43,041
When I visit religious houses,

76
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:45,501
I do so to urge those inside

77
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:49,440
to cleanse and purify their
corrupt lives and doctrine,

78
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:52,143
or else they will surely be destroyed.

79
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:55,680
Yes... Yes, it's true.

80
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,174
We evangelicals must

81
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:00,384
breathe new life into dead bones

82
00:08:01,182 --> 00:08:04,090
and encourage the ignorant
to believe in priority of faith

83
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,074
and the word of God.

84
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,795
I see we understand each other,
Sir Henry.

85
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:14,832
Lady Sheldon...

86
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,861
Sir Henry Norris has come courting.

87
00:08:24,544 --> 00:08:25,487
My Lord.

88
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,159
Madam.

89
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,650
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

90
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:46,402
I had the dream again.

91
00:08:46,562 --> 00:08:48,411
- Anne.
- I told you.

92
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:52,036
- I am her death and she is mine.
- For God's sake.

93
00:08:52,276 --> 00:08:55,315
So long as they are both alive,
I can't be safe.

94
00:08:56,691 --> 00:08:58,447
Why doesn't Katherine just die?

95
00:08:58,607 --> 00:09:01,762
- Everyone keeps telling how ill she is.
- Stop it.

96
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:05,310
I had a thought. The next time Henry
goes abroad, I shall be left as Regent.

97
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,141
I can just order their deaths.

98
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:08,900
You're crazy. Stop it.

99
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,083
Stop it!

100
00:09:14,593 --> 00:09:15,726
Listen to me.

101
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:17,619
You're the Queen of England.

102
00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:19,644
For the love of God, act like it.

103
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,081
After all,

104
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,576
you were a Lady to Queen Katherine.

105
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:28,488
You saw and heard how she behaved.

106
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,384
It seemed to me she never
betrayed her real feelings.

107
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:33,655
Can you not be more like her?

108
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,980
- More like Katherine?
- Yes.

109
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:41,011
You heard me.

110
00:09:41,468 --> 00:09:43,299
At least seem happy.

111
00:09:43,808 --> 00:09:45,677
Not a heap of misery!

112
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,034
Father Abbot...

113
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:18,164
What is it, brother John.

114
00:10:18,324 --> 00:10:19,798
A letter from the King.

115
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:25,047
We are to be suppressed.

116
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,082
By the orders of Mr. Cromwell.

117
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:29,786
I don't understand.
Give me the letter.

118
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,681
What have we done, Father?

119
00:10:38,426 --> 00:10:39,693
I don't know.

120
00:10:40,757 --> 00:10:42,440
What is to become of us?

121
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,588
Will you ask the French
Ambassador again

122
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,183
if Francis will not
relent and agree...

123
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:16,220
to the marriage of
Elizabeth to his son?

124
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:19,850
- I might.
- Don't you think it's important?

125
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,561
Don't you think the future
of your daughter is important?

126
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:24,674
- Of course, I do.
- Well then...

127
00:11:24,794 --> 00:11:26,939
Surely you understand
that Francis' refusal

128
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:29,791
to agree to the marriage in
the first place was insulting.

129
00:11:31,682 --> 00:11:34,800
- Do you want me to go back and beg?
- No. Of course not.

130
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:42,626
Sweetheart...

131
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:44,548
it's been tasted.

132
00:11:45,445 --> 00:11:46,957
It's not poisonous.

133
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,631
The fact of the matter is

134
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:57,638
it might be better for us to pursue
an alliance with the Emperor.

135
00:11:57,878 --> 00:12:01,309
- That would suit Katherine.
- It has nothing to do with Katherine.

136
00:12:03,244 --> 00:12:05,253
It has to do with England.

137
00:12:06,032 --> 00:12:08,213
And England's interests.

138
00:12:09,743 --> 00:12:10,861
After all,

139
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:13,757
I am supposed to be concerned with that.

140
00:12:27,904 --> 00:12:30,254
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

141
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,666
You have no reason to be.

142
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,291
You care for our daughter,

143
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:38,737
as you should.

144
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,014
But leave the greater
things to my care.

145
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,135
Do you understand?

146
00:13:05,675 --> 00:13:08,918
What a pleasure to have you
and your lovely wife to serve.

147
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:11,962
So tell me, you're suppressing
some religious houses?

148
00:13:12,202 --> 00:13:14,367
I am starting to, yes.

149
00:13:14,696 --> 00:13:16,340
And what else?

150
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:19,354
I am intending to abolish

151
00:13:19,474 --> 00:13:22,024
almost all the holidays that
fall during the law terms

152
00:13:22,184 --> 00:13:24,014
and during the harvest.

153
00:13:24,134 --> 00:13:26,908
These forced holidays, they damage
the country's economy,

154
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:29,374
stop vital works, and in fact they also

155
00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:31,009
impoverish workers.

156
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:32,274
And the priests?

157
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:36,612
As far as the clergy are concerned
we mean to issue a set of injunctions

158
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,781
requiring them to
preach the Supremacy.

159
00:13:39,022 --> 00:13:41,942
There will also be an injunction
requiring parents and employers

160
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:45,079
to teach their children and
servants the Lord's Prayer,

161
00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:47,108
Creed and the Ten Commandments

162
00:13:47,268 --> 00:13:49,202
in English rather than in Latin.

163
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,651
And all clerics will be put
on notice to attack

164
00:13:51,771 --> 00:13:54,468
the superstitious cult
surrounding images and relics.

165
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:58,556
It will more profit their souls
to bestow upon the poor and the needy

166
00:13:58,676 --> 00:14:00,580
what they currently waste on relics.

167
00:14:01,443 --> 00:14:03,768
That's very good, gentlemen.

168
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:07,017
But allow me to chide you.

169
00:14:07,485 --> 00:14:10,752
I don't think that you're going
far enough, or fast enough.

170
00:14:13,117 --> 00:14:16,000
Your wife is, quite radical, Thomas.

171
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,028
She is. And illegal.

172
00:14:20,762 --> 00:14:22,359
Two reasons to hide her.

173
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,870
Being carried around in a box
does not make you laugh.

174
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:31,126
My dear, I am sorry about that.

175
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:33,752
I am not your dear. I am nobody's dear.

176
00:14:33,992 --> 00:14:36,911
I am a woman and I demand
equal respect for my ideas.

177
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:40,479
For me, the practices of the
Catholic church are evil.

178
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,437
The way people are
kept in total ignorance

179
00:14:43,597 --> 00:14:46,932
and made to feel guilty about their
own bodies and their own thoughts.

180
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:49,507
And even worse, the idea that

181
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:52,643
the rich can buy a plot in
heaven for their souls.

182
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:56,304
I agree with you. The Catholic Church
is corrupted. It's irredeemable.

183
00:14:56,464 --> 00:14:59,487
Then you should smash and destroy
it utterly and totally

184
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:01,158
and without pity.

185
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,815
That is my advice to you, Mr. Cromwell.

186
00:15:09,512 --> 00:15:11,897
Now you can put me back in my box.

187
00:15:15,053 --> 00:15:16,790
Good evening, your Grace.

188
00:15:17,202 --> 00:15:19,088
Good evening, Mr. Secretary.

189
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,726
- Ready.
- Giddy up!

190
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,547
Why are you here, Thomas?

191
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,057
To see the degradation that
we have been forced to?

192
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:00,610
No.

193
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,747
I don't like to see it.

194
00:16:07,123 --> 00:16:09,085
I wonder why you stay.

195
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,226
Why don't you come back to court?

196
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,020
I love the Queen.

197
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:19,520
Nothing in this world
will make me leave her.

198
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,527
I am a Catholic.

199
00:16:22,768 --> 00:16:24,477
I believe in my faith.

200
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:28,325
Perhaps you poets don't
believe in anything?

201
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:30,328
In love, perhaps.

202
00:16:33,552 --> 00:16:34,829
You may kiss me.

203
00:16:37,014 --> 00:16:38,733
Then you will leave me alone.

204
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:40,385
Forever.

205
00:17:03,563 --> 00:17:04,778
Elizabeth.

206
00:17:33,504 --> 00:17:34,308
Sir?

207
00:17:35,715 --> 00:17:37,400
Ah, forgive me.

208
00:17:37,815 --> 00:17:40,230
I should have warned you of
my impending visit.

209
00:17:41,488 --> 00:17:43,750
- Who are you?
- My name is John Leland.

210
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:46,182
I am His Majesty's librarian.

211
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,494
You keep a library
in the priory, I believe?

212
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:53,801
We do, indeed, Mr. Leland.

213
00:17:54,717 --> 00:17:58,332
It contains many fine and
old manuscripts and texts.

214
00:17:59,459 --> 00:18:00,995
We are very proud of it.

215
00:18:04,052 --> 00:18:06,890
The King has commissioned me
to peruse and diligently search

216
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,681
all the libraries belonging to those
religious houses about to be suppressed.

217
00:18:13,185 --> 00:18:16,693
He is anxious to preserve
all their literary treasures.

218
00:18:19,037 --> 00:18:21,807
You mean you intend to
remove them from here?

219
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,380
Naturally.

220
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:26,151
They will be housed
in the Royal Libraries.

221
00:18:27,543 --> 00:18:28,365
But...

222
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,130
His Majesty has also
ordered me to find texts

223
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,726
that would emphasize the Royal
Supremacy and the New Monarchy.

224
00:18:36,037 --> 00:18:38,045
I do not think, Mr. Leland,

225
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:40,935
that you will find
many such texts here.

226
00:18:54,193 --> 00:18:55,461
Your Majesty?

227
00:18:58,302 --> 00:18:59,880
Elizabeth...

228
00:19:00,903 --> 00:19:02,828
Oh, my own heart.

229
00:19:04,152 --> 00:19:06,368
Ma... mama.

230
00:19:06,838 --> 00:19:07,960
Hello.

231
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:12,990
You may leave us now, Lady Bryan.

232
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:18,374
My dear girl... My sweetheart.

233
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,065
Why do you leave?

234
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,458
- Have you missed me?
- Yes.

235
00:19:22,698 --> 00:19:25,586
You missed me? I missed you.

236
00:19:26,244 --> 00:19:27,296
So much.

237
00:19:41,678 --> 00:19:42,682
Here...

238
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,303
And here...

239
00:19:46,246 --> 00:19:47,420
I see one.

240
00:19:49,963 --> 00:19:52,196
I see a little fishie.

241
00:19:53,048 --> 00:19:55,048
Where do you see  fishies, my darling?

242
00:20:04,548 --> 00:20:07,169
- Have you talked to the Queen recently?
- Yes.

243
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:09,880
She's giving me cause for concern.

244
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,690
The King is not so much
in love with her as he used to be.

245
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,846
- What's wrong with her?
- I don't know.

246
00:20:14,966 --> 00:20:16,361
Perhaps she's afraid.

247
00:20:17,488 --> 00:20:20,722
Poor George.
Have you gone softheaded?

248
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,090
- Me? No.
- I hope not.

249
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:27,262
You see, George,
the stakes are too high.

250
00:20:27,637 --> 00:20:29,953
Whoever is a coward now will
soon rue the day,

251
00:20:30,113 --> 00:20:31,803
and regret his misfortune.

252
00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:35,531
Successful people only
recognize fear in others.

253
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,900
Go and talk to your sister again!

254
00:20:44,446 --> 00:20:46,085
- Better?
- Much, thank you.

255
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,310
Ladies.

256
00:21:04,402 --> 00:21:06,383
Is this not better, George?

257
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,053
Much better.

258
00:21:11,811 --> 00:21:14,525
- Will you dance, My Lord?
- No. Not now.

259
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,315
My Lord.

260
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:26,690
All this time
and you're still in love with her.

261
00:21:29,191 --> 00:21:30,571
You're wrong, My Lord.

262
00:21:31,313 --> 00:21:33,745
My love was sprung and
spent a long time ago.

263
00:21:54,207 --> 00:21:55,819
Your Majesty.

264
00:22:11,688 --> 00:22:12,684
Mark.

265
00:22:18,653 --> 00:22:19,930
Play a volta.

266
00:25:01,012 --> 00:25:03,059
I want to conceive again.

267
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,097
I want to conceive a son.

268
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,397
A son to be the living
image of his father.

269
00:25:22,237 --> 00:25:23,693
But I can't.

270
00:25:25,895 --> 00:25:26,695
Why?

271
00:25:27,988 --> 00:25:31,451
As long as they're alive,
I can't conceive a son.

272
00:25:34,687 --> 00:25:36,081
What are you saying?

273
00:25:40,448 --> 00:25:42,288
Katherine and her daughter.

274
00:25:47,865 --> 00:25:49,949
Are you saying you want
me to kill them?

275
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,682
Mary...

276
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:30,018
Is it you?

277
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,196
Elizabeth.

278
00:26:36,393 --> 00:26:37,473
Madam.

279
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:41,880
I have not seen my daughter

280
00:26:42,495 --> 00:26:44,336
for more than four years.

281
00:26:45,663 --> 00:26:48,386
Is it not cruel of them
to keep her from me?

282
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,587
Gentle Madam, yes.

283
00:26:51,598 --> 00:26:53,504
It burns my heart.

284
00:26:59,197 --> 00:27:01,995
Read the Curia's Judgment to me again.

285
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:03,877
Please.

286
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:24,475
"We pronounce that the marriage
between Henry VIII

287
00:27:24,595 --> 00:27:26,473
"and Katherine of Aragon

288
00:27:26,593 --> 00:27:28,878
"stands firm and canonical,

289
00:27:29,591 --> 00:27:30,960
"and their issue

290
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,220
still stands lawful and legitimate."

291
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:49,539
You see?

292
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,800
This is the eternal truth...

293
00:27:54,746 --> 00:27:57,471
which no man can ever deny.

294
00:28:05,459 --> 00:28:07,637
Holy Father, Eminences,

295
00:28:08,501 --> 00:28:11,512
The next item for our deliberation...

296
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:13,571
Alessandro!

297
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,935
Let me look at you.

298
00:28:16,432 --> 00:28:19,328
Well, well, well, how you've grown.

299
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:21,338
You're almost a man.

300
00:28:24,372 --> 00:28:27,460
- Are you honest and clean?
- <i>Si</i>, grandfather.

301
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,588
When you pray to God
are you truly humble?

302
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:31,915
Sure.

303
00:28:34,078 --> 00:28:35,158
Good boy.

304
00:28:39,379 --> 00:28:40,773
Off you go.

305
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:43,890
He'll make a fine Cardinal.

306
00:28:45,494 --> 00:28:47,022
Don't you think?

307
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,322
Monsignors, we have other
business to discuss.

308
00:28:55,562 --> 00:28:56,624
First,

309
00:28:56,744 --> 00:28:59,595
I have invited the sculptor
Michelangelo to paint

310
00:28:59,715 --> 00:29:02,246
a Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel.

311
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,538
Holy Father,

312
00:29:04,108 --> 00:29:06,958
 there are still people
who object to his work on the ceiling.

313
00:29:07,198 --> 00:29:09,267
I know. I did myself.

314
00:29:09,586 --> 00:29:10,837
But now I like it.

315
00:29:11,171 --> 00:29:13,096
Won't the Judgment be expensive?

316
00:29:13,216 --> 00:29:15,133
No. We won't pay him very much.

317
00:29:15,373 --> 00:29:17,344
He's only an artist, after all.

318
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,432
What of the King of
England's Great Matter?

319
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,326
I will tell you a story.

320
00:29:27,786 --> 00:29:30,875
Once, when I was a boy, I went swimming,

321
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,639
and the tide carried me away,

322
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:37,936
far from the shore,
into the deepest water.

323
00:29:38,786 --> 00:29:41,500
It was then I prayed aloud to God,

324
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:43,629
and a friendly wave came

325
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:46,122
and pushed me back to the shore.

326
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:48,922
So it is with the King of England.

327
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:51,772
He has been carried
far from the shore

328
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:53,505
but he does not know it.

329
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:57,466
He does not ask for God's help.

330
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,210
He does not ask for our help.

331
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:03,220
He thinks he can swim alone.

332
00:30:03,973 --> 00:30:06,169
But very soon he will realize

333
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:09,110
he is not swimming but drowning.

334
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,083
Come on! Come on, hurry!

335
00:30:17,436 --> 00:30:19,511
Why are you crying like a baby?

336
00:30:19,764 --> 00:30:21,877
These are nothing but idols.

337
00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:40,412
Come on! Come on, goats!

338
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,150
Father, who are these men?

339
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,552
Bretons. From France.

340
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:48,220
- Huguenots.
- Protestants?

341
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:51,433
Perhaps Mr. Secretary
Cromwell felt that he couldn't

342
00:30:51,553 --> 00:30:54,140
trust Englishmen to destroy
their own heritage

343
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,317
and besmirch their own faith.

344
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:03,315
The Queen!

345
00:31:04,211 --> 00:31:05,563
Your Majesty...

346
00:31:14,592 --> 00:31:16,463
Excuse me. Your Majesty.

347
00:31:16,703 --> 00:31:18,506
I came to see the King.

348
00:31:19,366 --> 00:31:21,484
Madam, His Majesty left
early this morning

349
00:31:21,604 --> 00:31:23,672
to go hunting
with the Duke of Suffolk...

350
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:26,119
and other nobles.

351
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,725
Suffolk?

352
00:31:29,207 --> 00:31:30,388
Yes, Madam.

353
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:39,013
I remember now. He told me.

354
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,258
Your Majesty...

355
00:32:16,214 --> 00:32:17,388
A good kill. 

356
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:20,111
Do you want to get back to the palace?

357
00:32:20,536 --> 00:32:21,336
No.

358
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:24,094
Is there somewhere
around here we can stay?

359
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:26,207
There's Wulfhall.

360
00:32:27,607 --> 00:32:28,602
Wulfhall...

361
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:30,527
Who owns that house?

362
00:32:30,647 --> 00:32:32,696
Sir John Seymour and his family.

363
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,442
I remember Sir John.

364
00:32:35,715 --> 00:32:37,236
He was in France with us.

365
00:32:43,204 --> 00:32:44,585
Let's go surprise him.

366
00:33:42,608 --> 00:33:43,970
Sir John...

367
00:33:50,408 --> 00:33:52,408
Who is this shouting?

368
00:33:52,528 --> 00:33:54,704
Sir John, you have an unexpected guest.

369
00:33:59,574 --> 00:34:01,663
- Your Majesty!
- Sir John.

370
00:34:02,846 --> 00:34:04,893
You are most welcome.

371
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:29,191
Your Majesty must forgive
the tardiness of my kitchen.

372
00:35:29,311 --> 00:35:31,574
I think I am very well
looked after, Sir John.

373
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,952
The Duke and I were reminiscing
about the French campaign.

374
00:35:35,072 --> 00:35:36,688
Ah, yes!

375
00:35:37,181 --> 00:35:39,782
It was a shame we only fought
one battle against them.

376
00:35:39,902 --> 00:35:41,533
Ah, but what a battle.

377
00:35:41,653 --> 00:35:43,449
I remember how we charged at them,

378
00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:46,745
with His Grace leading the vanguard
with tremendous bravery.

379
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:50,986
And how the French were
broken and routed in the charge

380
00:35:51,227 --> 00:35:54,193
- and fled the field before us.
- All we saw were their spurs.

381
00:35:55,217 --> 00:35:58,578
I must tell Your Majesty that the
Milanese Ambassador was amazed by you.

382
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:02,589
He said to me, "The King was fresher
after his exertion than before.

383
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:04,786
I do not know how he can stand it."

384
00:36:11,593 --> 00:36:13,170
To past victories.

385
00:36:16,015 --> 00:36:17,020
To John.

386
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:36,307
Mary?

387
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:38,826
Oh, Mary.

388
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:41,237
My daughter...

389
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:44,958
Oh, sweetheart.

390
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:48,044
Is it you?

391
00:36:49,421 --> 00:36:51,581
Don't weep. Don't weep.
Let me look at you.

392
00:36:52,698 --> 00:36:54,133
There you are.

393
00:36:54,607 --> 00:36:57,136
I have not seen you for so long.

394
00:36:57,698 --> 00:36:59,209
An eternity.

395
00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:00,768
And here you are.

396
00:37:02,707 --> 00:37:05,360
Oh, my sweet child.

397
00:37:07,044 --> 00:37:08,837
My beloved child,

398
00:37:09,456 --> 00:37:10,733
my angel,

399
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:13,612
my world...

400
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,829
Mary...

401
00:37:17,891 --> 00:37:19,591
Mi preciosa.

402
00:37:25,684 --> 00:37:27,600
She was here.

403
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:29,961
She came to me.

404
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:32,297
Yes, Madam.

405
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:34,579
I know.

406
00:37:39,261 --> 00:37:41,637
Let me summon a doctor for you.

407
00:37:41,834 --> 00:37:42,634
No.

408
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,033
I don't want a doctor.

409
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:47,618
I have wholly committed myself

410
00:37:47,738 --> 00:37:49,564
to the pleasure of God.

411
00:37:55,223 --> 00:37:56,960
May the omnipotent God...

412
00:37:57,778 --> 00:37:59,383
have mercy upon you

413
00:38:00,663 --> 00:38:02,390
and forgive you your sins,

414
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,416
and may Jesus Christ

415
00:38:04,754 --> 00:38:06,372
lead you to eternal life.

416
00:38:22,632 --> 00:38:24,632
Oh, Mark. I'm so sad.

417
00:38:26,563 --> 00:38:27,577
Why sad?

418
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,893
If I had a son...

419
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:36,120
if I had a son, it would bring
about a golden world.

420
00:38:56,009 --> 00:38:58,327
I had never seen a sea
of mud like that before.

421
00:38:58,447 --> 00:39:01,296
- I didn't know what to think of it.
- When your horse sank up

422
00:39:01,416 --> 00:39:03,136
to its hind quarters in it,

423
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,681
I shall never forget your face.

424
00:39:05,921 --> 00:39:08,905
What was I supposed to do?
I was in full armor.

425
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:17,557
Your Majesty, may I present my daughter,

426
00:39:17,763 --> 00:39:19,406
Lady Jane Seymour.

427
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,083
Jane.

428
00:40:08,196 --> 00:40:09,445
Your Majesty.

429
00:40:11,851 --> 00:40:13,708
Mr. Secretary Cromwell is here.

430
00:40:18,641 --> 00:40:19,693
Madam.

431
00:40:20,228 --> 00:40:21,721
You wished to see me?

432
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,930
My father tells me you
are determined to close

433
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,735
every religious house
in England. Is it true?

434
00:40:29,965 --> 00:40:30,922
Yes.

435
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:34,692
As Your Majesty knows,
the church commissioners found that

436
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:37,722
fraud, laxity and abuse
were commonplace.

437
00:40:38,565 --> 00:40:42,386
Yet some religious houses received
good report. Is that not also true?

438
00:40:46,217 --> 00:40:49,380
I also hear that all the wealth
and assets of the monasteries

439
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,030
are to be transferred
to the King's Treasury.

440
00:40:53,149 --> 00:40:55,930
Indeed. I intend to make
the King the most powerful

441
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,889
and the richest King in Europe.

442
00:40:58,325 --> 00:41:02,258
But surely some of that wealth
could be put to better uses.

443
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:06,563
- Better uses, Madam?
- Yes.

444
00:41:06,683 --> 00:41:10,196
For endowments to charitable
and educational causes,

445
00:41:10,316 --> 00:41:11,863
which even Wolsey did.

446
00:41:14,688 --> 00:41:17,755
Madam, I am surprised
to hear you question

447
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:21,607
the King's policy, which your father
and brother whole-heartedly support.

448
00:41:21,727 --> 00:41:25,242
I question the policy, Mr. Secretary,
because I am not convinced

449
00:41:25,362 --> 00:41:27,325
- that it is the King's.
- Madam, I...

450
00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:30,162
You are far
too high-handed, Mr. Cromwell!

451
00:41:31,982 --> 00:41:34,967
You ought to be careful,
or I will have you cropped at the neck.

452
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,870
I know that I must die.

453
00:42:13,117 --> 00:42:15,755
I ask that my debts be cleared

454
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,180
and my servants be recompensed

455
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,409
for the good service

456
00:42:21,529 --> 00:42:23,081
they have done for me.

457
00:42:25,747 --> 00:42:29,738
I wish to be buried in the
convent of the Observant Friars.

458
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:33,953
And I would wish
that 500 masses be said

459
00:42:34,413 --> 00:42:35,643
for my soul...

460
00:42:37,584 --> 00:42:39,265
and that someone would visit

461
00:42:39,843 --> 00:42:42,438
the Shrine of our Lady of Walsingham

462
00:42:42,926 --> 00:42:44,795
to pray on my behalf.

463
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,435
To my daughter, Mary.

464
00:42:51,966 --> 00:42:53,083
I leave...

465
00:42:53,827 --> 00:42:57,386
my collar of gold
I brought from Spain,

466
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:01,760
and my furs.

467
00:43:04,267 --> 00:43:05,788
Madam, let me help you.

468
00:43:07,788 --> 00:43:10,840
Thank you, my loyal
and loving Elizabeth.

469
00:43:11,731 --> 00:43:13,975
I must write to the King.

470
00:43:18,743 --> 00:43:20,170
"My Lord

471
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:23,465
"and dear husband.

472
00:43:25,279 --> 00:43:27,110
"I commend me unto you.

473
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:32,760
"The hour of my death draws fast on,

474
00:43:33,496 --> 00:43:35,309
"and my case being such...

475
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,441
"the tender love I owe you

476
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:43,395
"forces me to put you in remembrance

477
00:43:43,515 --> 00:43:44,710
"of the health

478
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:48,599
"and safeguard of your soul...

479
00:43:51,213 --> 00:43:53,623
"which you ought to prefer

480
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:55,886
"above all considerations

481
00:43:56,006 --> 00:43:58,450
"of the world of flesh whatsoever,

482
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:02,322
"for which you have cast
me into many miseries,

483
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:05,711
"and yourself into many cares.

484
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:07,436
"For my part...

485
00:44:08,965 --> 00:44:11,761
"I do pardon you all,

486
00:44:12,869 --> 00:44:13,822
"Yea,

487
00:44:14,149 --> 00:44:15,808
"and I do wish

488
00:44:16,258 --> 00:44:18,615
"and pray dearly God

489
00:44:19,526 --> 00:44:21,534
"He will pardon you also.

"For the rest,

00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,569

00:44:44,552 --> 00:44:46,049

"I vow

497
00:44:51,686 --> 00:44:54,953
"that mine eyes desire you

above all things."

499
00:45:30,236 --> 00:45:32,095
Elizabeth, help me.

500
00:46:03,153 --> 00:46:05,092
In manus tuas commendo

501
00:46:05,212 --> 00:46:07,061
spiritum meum.

502
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:56,584
Madam...

503
00:46:57,115 --> 00:46:58,392
What is it, Nan?

504
00:47:09,912 --> 00:47:11,546
Now I am indeed Queen.

505
00:47:30,876 --> 00:47:31,918
Elizabeth?

506
00:47:54,029 --> 00:47:55,193
Oh, Jesus...

507
00:49:47,398 --> 00:49:49,511
- This is my wife, Catherine.
- Sir John.

508
00:49:59,991 --> 00:50:01,613
Here comes Her Majesty now.

509
00:50:07,364 --> 00:50:08,585
My Lady.

510
00:50:12,265 --> 00:50:13,770
Your Majesties.

511
00:50:14,842 --> 00:50:16,758
Go watch the cockfight, sweetheart.

512
00:50:18,468 --> 00:50:20,056
My Lady.

513
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:23,069
Not performing today, Mark?

514
00:50:25,477 --> 00:50:26,970
No, not today, My Lord.

515
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:29,902
But perhaps later tonight?

516
00:50:31,344 --> 00:50:32,760
I'm not sure.

517
00:50:37,425 --> 00:50:39,092
Have you told her about me? Hm?

518
00:50:40,286 --> 00:50:41,534
About us?

519
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:45,339
Why the hell not? You're George Boleyn.
You're like a bloody god around here.

520
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:47,804
If you could read Greek, Master Smeaton,

521
00:50:48,283 --> 00:50:51,163
you'd know that even the gods
had problems with their wives.

522
00:51:09,686 --> 00:51:11,040
Sir John.

523
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,750
Your Majesty.

524
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:15,787
We wanted to thank you once more
for your generous hospitality.

525
00:51:16,215 --> 00:51:18,705
All the more so because our
visit was so unexpected.

526
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:21,534
Sire, it was the greatest
possible privilege and pleasure.

527
00:51:21,773 --> 00:51:24,433
And the room Your Majesty slept in
shall forever be known

528
00:51:24,553 --> 00:51:26,041
as "The King's bedroom."

529
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:29,364
Your daughter Jane
should come to court.

530
00:51:29,618 --> 00:51:31,176
As lady to Her Majesty.

531
00:51:31,823 --> 00:51:33,468
Thank you, Your Majesty.

532
00:51:33,588 --> 00:51:35,672
You do our family a great honor.

533
00:51:38,197 --> 00:51:40,469
Sweetheart. Come here.

534
00:51:44,971 --> 00:51:46,125
Papa...

535
00:51:47,388 --> 00:51:48,712
My Elizabeth.

536
00:51:51,046 --> 00:51:53,009
Guards, guards! Protect me!

537
00:51:54,469 --> 00:51:55,755
Now, men.

538
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:58,384
En garde! You're going to protect me!

539
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,192
Protect your King!

540
00:52:00,312 --> 00:52:02,082
- My mama.
- Elizabeth.

541
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,294
My papa.

542
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:13,059
My Elizabeth.

543
00:52:23,243 --> 00:52:24,370
Anne.

544
00:52:27,662 --> 00:52:28,893
Yes, father.

545
00:52:29,013 --> 00:52:31,456
I have heard some
reports that alarm me.

546
00:52:31,867 --> 00:52:33,547
What reports?

547
00:52:34,096 --> 00:52:36,725
It seems you have quarreled
with Mr. Cromwell.

548
00:52:37,602 --> 00:52:39,085
We disagreed

549
00:52:39,205 --> 00:52:41,348
on an important and public issue.

550
00:52:41,468 --> 00:52:45,237
Anne, I did not bring you up
to have opinions

551
00:52:45,357 --> 00:52:49,115
or to express them or to quarrel
with those closest to the Crown.

552
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:52,346
But I am closest to the Crown.
I am the King's wife.

553
00:52:52,466 --> 00:52:55,093
And you should remember
how you got there!

554
00:52:57,689 --> 00:52:59,490
I know how I got there.

555
00:53:00,329 --> 00:53:01,897
And it was not all you.

556
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:05,883
It was not all you
or Norfolk or George

557
00:53:06,003 --> 00:53:08,366
or any other man you want to name.

558
00:53:09,868 --> 00:53:11,966
It was also me.

559
00:53:13,511 --> 00:53:17,157
He fell in love with me.
He respected me...

560
00:53:20,087 --> 00:53:21,589
and my opinions.

561
00:53:30,368 --> 00:53:31,523
What is it?

562
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,951
You have no need to worry.

563
00:53:34,571 --> 00:53:36,512
There is good news all round.

564
00:53:36,632 --> 00:53:38,711
Katherine is dead...

565
00:53:40,308 --> 00:53:41,510
and I...

566
00:53:44,569 --> 00:53:47,019
I am pregnant.

567
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,570
Do you understand?

568
00:53:51,121 --> 00:53:53,286
I am carrying

569
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:55,565
the King's son.

570
00:54:04,002 --> 00:54:07,050
We are on the edge
of a golden world.
