2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:04,141
- Do you really want to fight?
- Yes.

3
00:00:04,308 --> 00:00:06,003
- Take another wife?
- Yes.

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,466
Am I not still able to have a wife,
to have more children?

5
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:11,094
To be myself?

6
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,681
I mean to show these French that I won't
shy away from battle if I am provoked.

7
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:17,124
The Emperor is once more at war.

8
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:20,478
A joint attack on France would
restore to the English crown

9
00:00:20,728 --> 00:00:23,909
all your lost territories,
the whole of Aquitaine.

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,068
I still think the King
will want to remarry.

11
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,741
And yet what woman on earth
would want to marry a King

12
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:32,741
who either puts his wives away
or kills them?

13
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,209
Lady Latimer has come
to petition Your Majesty

14
00:00:36,376 --> 00:00:38,371
to lift a suspicion of treason
from her husband.

15
00:00:40,543 --> 00:00:42,542
The King seems quite taken
with Lady Latimer.

16
00:00:43,524 --> 00:00:45,587
You have no children
and none by your first husband?

17
00:00:45,907 --> 00:00:47,380
It was not a happy marriage.

18
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,551
- Do you think such a thing exists?
- I believe so with all my heart.

19
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:56,175
We should start hunting down all
the Lutherans in His Majesty's kingdom.

20
00:00:56,342 --> 00:00:57,776
We should flush them out?

21
00:00:57,943 --> 00:01:00,647
Some of them are very close
to the King.

22
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:03,682
You would not like
to be Queen of England?

23
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:08,401
You know what happens to his queens!
Everyone knows what happens.

24
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,904
Let it be known to all
present that this treaty

25
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:14,616
contains an obligation to undertake
a war against France.

26
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:18,867
His Majesty agrees to send
40,000 men-at-arms.

27
00:01:19,516 --> 00:01:21,066
I do, so help me God.

28
00:01:21,524 --> 00:01:23,875
What could make a revengeful prince
like the Emperor?

29
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,696
Forget the insult done to him
by the King of England?

30
00:01:26,863 --> 00:01:29,371
Those insults are long forgotten,
Monsieur Marillac.

31
00:01:29,538 --> 00:01:32,634
Catherine Parr, we are sent here
by the King's Majesty to offer you

32
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,594
His Majesty's hand in marriage.

33
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,013
He will be the happiest man
now alive in England,

34
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,113
and you the happiest woman.

00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:00,887
My Lords,

41
00:03:01,636 --> 00:03:04,726
we will now proceed with our plans
for an invasion of France.

42
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:08,695
We will start by the capture
of the strategic town of Boulogne.

43
00:03:09,418 --> 00:03:10,468
Your Grace,

44
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:13,777
I shall appoint you
commander of our armies,

45
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,362
if you have the will
and the stomach for the fight.

46
00:03:18,647 --> 00:03:21,618
I can only thank God for the chance
to win honour and glory in the field.

47
00:03:22,264 --> 00:03:24,555
What man wouldn't prefer to die
with a sword in his hand

48
00:03:24,722 --> 00:03:27,937
and a cry in his throat,
rather than abed in England?

49
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,042
Aye!

50
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:32,566
My Lords,

51
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:37,190
I must tell you that a special envoy
from the court of the Emperor,

52
00:03:37,357 --> 00:03:40,845
the Duke of Najera,
will pay us an unofficial visit,

53
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:43,309
in honour of our alliance.

54
00:03:43,587 --> 00:03:46,894
The Duke is one of the Emperor's
most successful generals.

55
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:50,504
He should be first received
here by the Earl of Surrey

56
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:52,202
and then brought to court.

57
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:56,189
I'm sure your Lordships will see fit
to welcome him as he deserves.

58
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,633
I have vowed to bring King Francis
into submission,

59
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,910
and I will fulfil this promise.

60
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:07,121
I have been all my life
a prince of virtue and honour,

61
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:09,418
as you can all attest,

62
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,460
and I have never
contravened my word.

63
00:04:14,871 --> 00:04:16,621
I'm too old to begin now.

64
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:21,766
"I, Catherine

65
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:24,861
"take thee, Henry,

66
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:27,533
"to be my wedded husband,

67
00:04:28,845 --> 00:04:31,495
"to have and to hold
from this day forward,

68
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:34,686
"for better, for worse,

69
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:36,983
"for richer, for poorer,

70
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,946
"in sickness and in health,

71
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:44,463
"to be bonnier and buxom
in bed and at board,

72
00:04:46,126 --> 00:04:47,726
"till death us do part,

73
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,167
"and thereto
I plight thee my troth."

74
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:57,161
The ring.

00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:03,261

00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,931
"With this ring, I thee wed."

78
00:05:19,415 --> 00:05:20,673
"With my body,

79
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,410
"I thee worship."

80
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:25,366
<i>"In nomine Patris,</i>

81
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:27,410

00:05:28,302 --> 00:05:29,852
<i>"et Spiritus Sancti."</i>

83
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:33,625
I now pronounce thee man and wife.

84
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,441
Thank you, Lady Herbert.

85
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:22,939
Sister.

86
00:06:35,922 --> 00:06:37,480
Your Majesty, if I may?

87
00:06:41,814 --> 00:06:45,805
I am determined to be a loving
stepmother to your children.

88
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,533
Of course, I have known Mary
for years,

89
00:06:50,572 --> 00:06:53,343
but it would now be
my pleasure rather than my duty

90
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,541
to make friends with the Prince Edward
and the Princess Elizabeth.

91
00:06:58,512 --> 00:07:00,420
So with Your Majesty's permission

92
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:03,496
I would like to invite
them more often to court,

93
00:07:03,963 --> 00:07:05,590
not only for my sake

94
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:09,028
but so they might more often
see their father.

95
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:13,037
You have my permission.

96
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:16,728
Thank you.

97
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:23,318
And perhaps Your Majesty
might also agree

98
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:27,238
to the Lady Elizabeth having permanent
lodgings at court, like the Lady Mary?

99
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:32,906
Perhaps.

100
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,670
But I would not like my son Edward
to come to court too often,

101
00:07:37,135 --> 00:07:38,458
for fear of infection.

102
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:46,472
I have arranged for some gifts
to be delivered to you.

103
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:49,267
I hope you like them.

104
00:07:51,714 --> 00:07:52,714
Thank you.

105
00:07:57,121 --> 00:07:58,371
You're welcome.

106
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:08,805
Try this one, Your Grace.

107
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:14,968
- Your Grace.
- My Lords.

108
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,251
I am pleased to convey to you
His Majesty's commissions.

109
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:22,642
Sir Thomas, you are recalled
from Brussels

110
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:25,314
and are to be appointed
Admiral of the Fleet.

111
00:08:25,724 --> 00:08:29,592
My Lord Surrey, the King has seen fit
to make you Marshal of the Field,

112
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:31,341
a singular honour.

113
00:08:31,628 --> 00:08:32,678
Your Grace.

114
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:36,923
- When do we sail?
- As soon as the King commands.

115
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:39,269
Sir Thomas...

116
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:44,872
Is it true that your brother,
Lord Hertford

117
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,860
- is against this war?
- It is true, Your Grace.

118
00:08:48,776 --> 00:08:52,193
He worries for the King's health,
in body and in mind.

119
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:55,815
He fears that if His Majesty
should die in France,

120
00:08:56,225 --> 00:08:58,579
he would leave the kingdom
in great confusion.

121
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:00,685
How is the King?

122
00:09:02,365 --> 00:09:04,483
There are rumours that he is unwell.

123
00:09:05,426 --> 00:09:07,448
That he may be unable
to lead the army.

124
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,134
No, my Lord. The King will lead
his soldiers. Make no mistake of that.

125
00:09:11,897 --> 00:09:13,319
For here is the truth,

126
00:09:13,647 --> 00:09:16,129
the King does not
just want France back,

127
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:20,180
but all of his honour
and his youth as well.

128
00:09:25,203 --> 00:09:27,103
And, in that, he is like me.

129
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:48,813
May I present His Highness
Don Juan Estaban Manrique de Lara,

130
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,713
Duke of Najera.

131
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:56,564
- Your Highness.
- Your Majesty.

132
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,165
I am very happy to receive you
at my court.

133
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:02,951
I trust you have been
well entertained so far?

134
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,516
Indeed. I have visited
the famous Tower

135
00:10:11,046 --> 00:10:12,878
and also the River Thames.

136
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:17,215
It is not possible that a more beautiful
river should exist in the world.

137
00:10:17,382 --> 00:10:18,952
And with so many...

138
00:10:19,758 --> 00:10:21,561
- <i>cisnes?</i>
- Swans, your Highness.

139
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,789
Yes. Swans.

140
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:29,838
My Lord Surrey also took
His Highness to the Paris Gardens,

141
00:10:30,352 --> 00:10:32,238
to see bears fighting with dogs.

142
00:10:32,934 --> 00:10:34,383
And then, in the same place,

143
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,955
they brought a pony
with an ape on his back.

144
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,140
And to see the animal kicking among
the dogs, with the screams of the ape

145
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,840
was very laughable.

146
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:45,853
Well, Your Highness,

147
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,757
I trust this evening you will also
be well entertained

148
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:53,236
by my beautiful wife the Queen
and my first daughter, the Lady Mary.

149
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,069
His Highness only desires
Your Majesty to confirm

150
00:11:06,236 --> 00:11:08,474
if your armies are ready
for the invasion of France.

151
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,433
I have already given my word.

152
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,026
What more does Your Highness
expect of me?

153
00:11:33,588 --> 00:11:35,651
<i>His Highness, the Duke of Najera.</i>

154
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,780
The Lady Mary.

155
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:53,103
So, is it a coincidence
that there is talk of war

156
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,782
and then General Najera
turns up here at court?

157
00:12:57,358 --> 00:12:58,408
Absolutely.

158
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:01,281
This is a private visit.

159
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,742
His Highness came to London
to see the Tower

160
00:13:05,178 --> 00:13:06,545
and row on the river

161
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,096
and see the swans.

162
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:11,097
Do you take me for a fool?

163
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,003
No, Excellency.

164
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:15,211
You are what you are.

165
00:13:17,157 --> 00:13:18,257
And so am I.

166
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:24,888
Kat! May I not dance, please!

167
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,848
Of course you can.
Of course you can dance, my Lady.

168
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,666
Mr. Risley,

169
00:13:47,592 --> 00:13:50,940
may I ask, what have you heard
of the Queen's religious beliefs?

170
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:53,911
They are the same, surely,
as His Majesty's.

171
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:55,178
I think not.

172
00:13:55,612 --> 00:13:58,821
Indeed, I suspect Her Majesty
of being a secret Protestant

173
00:13:58,988 --> 00:14:01,314
and I intend one day to prove it.

174
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,094
And in so doing...

175
00:14:03,832 --> 00:14:06,137
risk the anger of the King?

176
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:08,242
Mr. Risley,

177
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:12,457
for the sake of our faith,
and the future of our country

178
00:14:12,963 --> 00:14:15,573
I am prepared to risk a great deal.

179
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:34,363
Dr. Butts! What is it?

180
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:38,017
It's the King's leg, Your Majesty. His
ulcer has burst, he is in great pain.

181
00:14:38,184 --> 00:14:39,184
Come.

182
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:43,498
Catherine!

183
00:14:44,002 --> 00:14:45,002
Dearest,

184
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:48,888
- let me see!
- Please, don't.

185
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:00,926
I have seen worse things.

186
00:15:01,595 --> 00:15:03,900
Give me a poultice, quickly now.

187
00:15:05,076 --> 00:15:06,780
If Your Majesty could move your leg,

188
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,176
and place it across my lap?

189
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:14,659
There, dearest.

190
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:16,721
Quickly!

191
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,699
As long as the King is sick,

192
00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:29,180
I will move my bed to his chamber,

193
00:15:29,973 --> 00:15:31,736
the better to look after him.

194
00:15:32,077 --> 00:15:33,077
Madam.

195
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:37,555
Next!

196
00:15:38,978 --> 00:15:39,978
Steady!

197
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,481
Forward.

198
00:15:43,223 --> 00:15:44,423
Come on, lads.

199
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:47,112
I went to war once, a long time ago.

200
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:51,598
We broke lances against the French.
The knights did in the old days.

201
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:53,798
This...

202
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,396
this is a different war,
a war of guns.

203
00:16:00,008 --> 00:16:01,585
- Good shot.
- Again.

204
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,676
Good shooting.

205
00:16:19,663 --> 00:16:21,218
Well done. What's your name?

206
00:16:21,385 --> 00:16:23,589
Richard, Your Grace, Richard Leland.

207
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,151
You are soon to war, Richard Leland.

208
00:16:32,823 --> 00:16:34,243
That was well done, Richard.

209
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:36,437
Harry. Harry Hurst.

210
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:38,831
- Are you coming to France?
- I don't know.

211
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:42,208
- I can't shoot like that.
- What can you do?

212
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,673
I'm a farm labourer, me.

213
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,485
I can herd cows, shovel shit,
and build fences.

214
00:16:47,895 --> 00:16:48,895
Christ!

215
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,450
I wish I'd half your talent, Harry!

216
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,766
Thank you.

217
00:16:53,876 --> 00:16:54,722
Next.

218
00:16:55,865 --> 00:16:57,015
Your Majesty,

219
00:16:58,325 --> 00:16:59,727
Prince Edward is here.

220
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,696
Madam.

221
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:15,374
Your Grace, how lovely to see you.

222
00:17:16,023 --> 00:17:18,947
Madam, I came to thank you
for the outfits

223
00:17:19,114 --> 00:17:22,848
of crimson velvet and white satin
you sent me.

224
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:26,219
I am very glad that you liked them.

225
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:30,424
I would also like to thank
my noble and illustrious father

226
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,448
for the jewels he sent me.

227
00:17:33,664 --> 00:17:35,564
But they told me he was sick.

228
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,326
I am pleased to tell Your Grace

229
00:17:38,493 --> 00:17:41,062
that His Majesty is now much better.

230
00:17:47,142 --> 00:17:49,776
He must love me,
for if he did not love me,

231
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,154
he would not give me
these fine gifts.

232
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,443
He loves you very much.

233
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,096
You are very special to him

234
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:03,707
and I know that he would like
to see you more often if he could.

235
00:18:05,287 --> 00:18:06,287
Thank you.

236
00:18:09,283 --> 00:18:10,991
I wish you a good day, Madam.

237
00:18:21,638 --> 00:18:22,688
Poor child.

238
00:18:26,216 --> 00:18:27,216
My Lords.

239
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,193
How go our preparations?
I think they have gone slackly!

240
00:18:32,497 --> 00:18:33,821
I'm beginning to suppose

241
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,969
your Lordships are not so keen
to go to war after all.

242
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,117
Sit.

243
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,629
Majesty, the gun carriages,
carts, wagons,

244
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,294
the ovens, horses,
artillery, and ordnance

245
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:48,618
are all made ready
and dispatched for shipping.

246
00:18:48,785 --> 00:18:51,717
And a further 300 ships have been
requisitioned for Your Majesty's use

247
00:18:51,884 --> 00:18:53,521
and will be in port
within the month.

248
00:18:53,688 --> 00:18:54,936
Within the month!

249
00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:58,053
They should be already in port
if you had not been so remiss

250
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,987
and neglectful in your duties!

251
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:02,037
What about our maps of Boulogne?

252
00:19:02,204 --> 00:19:05,457
Your Majesty,
we do not have any maps,

253
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,227
so we will have to rely
on the advice of a French spy,

254
00:19:09,438 --> 00:19:10,438
De Buren.

255
00:19:10,605 --> 00:19:13,018
So we are to blunder
about in the dark

256
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,563
and trust to the honesty
of French spies!

257
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,404
God help us, Your Grace,
for it seems you have not!

258
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:24,970
We will not wait for more ships!

259
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,408
This army will embark
for France in 10 days time,

260
00:19:29,575 --> 00:19:32,129
land in Calais and straight away
march to Boulogne.

261
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:36,673
We have three weeks to take this town
before we proceed on to Paris.

262
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:41,205
Now, while I am in France,

263
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,957
the Queen's Highness, Queen Catherine
will act as Regent

264
00:19:45,732 --> 00:19:47,282
and rule in my stead.

265
00:19:48,311 --> 00:19:50,814
Lord Hertford, who I begin
to suspect is against this war,

266
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,332
will stay as Lieutenant
to the Realm.

267
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,277
Need I remind your Lordships

268
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:59,294
that we go to France not solely
for honour and glory,

269
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:02,081
but to recover our just rights
and inheritances

270
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:04,498
taken from us by violence

271
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:06,845
and withheld from us for too long.

272
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:31,099
He has made the Queen Regent!

273
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,522
Why?

274
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,080
She has no knowledge
of matters of state!

275
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:37,447
I do not know.

276
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,701
But from what I hear of her,
I do not think it right.

277
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:45,184
I think the King should be aware
how perilous a matter it is

278
00:20:45,718 --> 00:20:48,150
to cherish a serpent
in one's own bosom.

279
00:20:58,249 --> 00:21:00,952
I have to tell you that I've left
all things here in order,

280
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:03,201
in case do not come back
from France.

281
00:21:05,487 --> 00:21:09,190
Shortly, Parliament will
pass a new Act of Succession,

282
00:21:10,195 --> 00:21:12,378
naming my son Edward as my heir.

283
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,447
If he has no issue,

284
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:18,529
then it passes to the Lady Mary

285
00:21:19,226 --> 00:21:20,903
and then to the Lady Elizabeth.

286
00:21:21,462 --> 00:21:22,888
Those are my wishes.

287
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:25,013
Understood.

288
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:35,669
Do not cry, Mary,

289
00:21:36,557 --> 00:21:38,407
for I do not intend to die.

290
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,558
Promise you will write to me often!

291
00:21:54,488 --> 00:21:56,964
Tell me all that happens
in my kingdom

292
00:21:57,131 --> 00:21:59,154
and whatever you see fit to write.

293
00:22:14,672 --> 00:22:17,127
I leave my children in your care,

294
00:22:17,698 --> 00:22:20,964
knowing that there are not
more loving hands in this world.

295
00:22:26,514 --> 00:22:27,514
Farewell.

296
00:23:16,232 --> 00:23:19,003
It makes you happy to be alive,
doesn't it, Majesty?

297
00:23:29,172 --> 00:23:30,222
Your Grace.

298
00:23:30,961 --> 00:23:31,961
Majesty.

299
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,328
Well met!

300
00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:36,101
How do we prosper?

301
00:23:36,881 --> 00:23:38,517
Majesty, the port is blockaded

302
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,487
and the town is partially invested.

303
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,546
Its gates are shut
and its defenders shut inside.

304
00:23:44,277 --> 00:23:46,922
The French consider
that their ramparts and double walls

305
00:23:47,089 --> 00:23:49,160
make them invulnerable
to our artillery!

306
00:23:51,198 --> 00:23:52,687
We shall see about that!

307
00:23:53,325 --> 00:23:55,814
We have brought enough
cannon here to conquer hell!

308
00:23:58,931 --> 00:23:59,931
Forward!

309
00:24:32,144 --> 00:24:33,511
I can't believe my eyes

310
00:24:33,678 --> 00:24:36,628
Look, Richard!
It's the King of England himself!

311
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,738
What do you think?

312
00:24:38,905 --> 00:24:42,066
I reckon if I were the French
I'd be fucking scared.

313
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,334
Englishmen, today you have
every reason to be proud!

314
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:51,115
Today, we begin
our campaign of Boulogne.

315
00:24:53,128 --> 00:24:55,267
We have offered terms of peace

316
00:24:55,563 --> 00:24:58,505
in return for our just rights
and inheritances.

317
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,152
But our enemy has refused
to render what they owe us.

318
00:25:05,343 --> 00:25:07,872
They should know that we do not

319
00:25:08,214 --> 00:25:11,314
lack the courage to fight
to the death for justice.

320
00:25:12,534 --> 00:25:15,254
These lands were taken from us

321
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:16,856
by violence

322
00:25:17,485 --> 00:25:19,466
and I mean to have them back.

323
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:22,109
For King Henry,

324
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:24,378
for England,

325
00:25:25,033 --> 00:25:26,311
and for St. George!

326
00:25:29,709 --> 00:25:31,094
Long live the King!

327
00:25:32,856 --> 00:25:33,956
For England!

328
00:25:45,567 --> 00:25:46,967
Prepare your fire!

329
00:25:50,307 --> 00:25:52,230
Solders, to your stations!

330
00:25:54,681 --> 00:25:56,760
Section One Commander!
Prepare your guns!

331
00:25:57,114 --> 00:25:59,038
Section One, prepare your guns!

332
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,732
Section Two Commander!
Prepare your guns!

333
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,629
Load your cannon!

334
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,905
- Prepare your guns!
- Ready, guns.

335
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:20,392
Section Three Commander!
Prepare your guns!

336
00:26:22,688 --> 00:26:23,738
Ram barrel!

337
00:26:25,069 --> 00:26:28,540
- Soldiers, into the trenches!
- Quick march!

338
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,696
Section Two Commander,
take both your men!

339
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,649
- Section Three, report when ready.
- Yes, sir!

340
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,041
- Section Three ready.
- That's ready, sir.

341
00:26:54,092 --> 00:26:57,530
All guns take aim
for the gates and castle.

342
00:26:57,697 --> 00:26:59,331
Section One, take aim!

343
00:26:59,498 --> 00:27:02,880
- Section Commanders!
- Confirm you have your target!

344
00:27:03,364 --> 00:27:05,442
Section Three, take aim.

345
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,519
Section One, target ready.

346
00:27:08,686 --> 00:27:11,294
Section Two, confirm target.

347
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:15,835
Section Two has target, sir.

348
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:20,964
- Section Three, confirm.
- Section Three ready.

349
00:27:21,527 --> 00:27:22,727
Hold sections!

350
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,573
Hold fire until I give the order!

351
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,760
Let's go, men.

352
00:27:28,476 --> 00:27:29,770
Hold fire!

353
00:27:31,697 --> 00:27:32,697
Move!

354
00:27:35,127 --> 00:27:36,721
Hold your fire!

355
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,197
Easy for the time!

356
00:27:42,283 --> 00:27:44,410
Now we'll see how invulnerable
it really is!

357
00:27:44,577 --> 00:27:45,677
In position!

358
00:27:47,822 --> 00:27:49,072
Ready, captain!

359
00:28:16,287 --> 00:28:18,682
Section one, fire!

360
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:23,326
For the King!

361
00:28:24,474 --> 00:28:26,383
- Ready!
- Ready!

362
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,030
All sections!

363
00:28:37,627 --> 00:28:38,532
Fire!

364
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,119
Section One, fire!

365
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,670
Ready!

366
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:27,185
Charge the gun!

367
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,706
- England!
- England!

368
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,918
Back into position!

369
00:29:47,312 --> 00:29:48,819
Reload all guns!

370
00:29:52,405 --> 00:29:55,311
If you could see that this is
delivered to My Lord Hertford.

371
00:29:56,064 --> 00:29:57,064
Thank you.

372
00:30:03,974 --> 00:30:04,969
Madam,

373
00:30:05,508 --> 00:30:06,901
here is Mr. Latimer.

374
00:30:11,482 --> 00:30:15,141
Alas, Madam, I am no longer
entitled to such an address.

375
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:18,525
I was deprived of my bishopric
by Bishop Gardiner.

376
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:20,259
I know.

377
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:23,036
And I know the circumstances of it.

378
00:30:23,803 --> 00:30:26,006
Still, I have a mind

379
00:30:26,173 --> 00:30:28,352
to appoint you
chaplain to my household.

380
00:30:29,784 --> 00:30:31,934
Are you absolutely sure, My Lady?

381
00:30:32,636 --> 00:30:34,437
You must know my reputation.

382
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:38,539
Your reputation, Mr. Latimer,
is of a man of the Gospels

383
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,480
and a true Christian.

384
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:46,026
For example, do you suppose
that it is a bad thing

385
00:30:46,193 --> 00:30:49,764
that everyone should be able
to read the Bible for themselves?

386
00:30:52,322 --> 00:30:55,014
On the contrary, I believe it
to be a vital thing.

387
00:30:55,571 --> 00:30:58,347
For without God's direct word
we that be unlettered

388
00:30:58,514 --> 00:31:00,865
remain confused and without grace.

389
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,642
Even though some would say

390
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:06,607
that the reading of the Bible
leads to heresy?

391
00:31:07,673 --> 00:31:08,883
If they say so,

392
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,848
then they are wickedly charging
the holy sanctified word of God

393
00:31:13,277 --> 00:31:15,680
- with the offences of man.
- You are right.

394
00:31:16,911 --> 00:31:20,834
Do people deny themselves food,
because they see others overeat?

395
00:31:21,001 --> 00:31:24,466
Or avoid using fire because they have
seen a neighbour's house burn down?

396
00:31:25,295 --> 00:31:29,273
Blind ignorance, Mr. Latimer,
to slander God for man's offences.

397
00:31:32,993 --> 00:31:35,114
If you are still of a mind
to have me,

398
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:38,936
I will most joyfully
be your chaplain.

399
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,290
I thank you.

400
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:46,401
I have one favour,

401
00:31:47,421 --> 00:31:49,557
which is that you conceal
the true workings

402
00:31:49,724 --> 00:31:51,605
of your mind from the Lady Mary.

403
00:31:51,878 --> 00:31:54,676
For nothing in this world
will change her allegiance

404
00:31:54,843 --> 00:31:56,204
to the faith of her mother,

405
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,709
and I respect her for that.

406
00:31:59,026 --> 00:32:01,241
Madam, believe me,

407
00:32:01,528 --> 00:32:03,838
I shall be the soul of discretion
in my dealings

408
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,820
with all His Majesty's children,

409
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,342
and with the world.

410
00:32:08,065 --> 00:32:09,065
Thank you.

411
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,160
My Lady.

412
00:32:21,596 --> 00:32:22,634
Sister,

413
00:32:25,145 --> 00:32:29,127
are you sure you can really trust
Mr. Latimer's discretion?

414
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:33,693
I know I should not say so
to Your Majesty,

415
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,739
but I fear his appointment.

416
00:32:37,362 --> 00:32:38,788
Should I play the coward?

417
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:45,202
You know that I never wanted
to marry the King.

418
00:32:46,286 --> 00:32:47,736
But since I had to,

419
00:32:48,318 --> 00:32:51,218
I may at least use
what influence I now possess

420
00:32:51,521 --> 00:32:54,500
to further the cause
that I believe in with all my heart.

421
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:57,059
The cause of the Reformation!

422
00:32:57,894 --> 00:33:00,164
Then at least I can address my God

423
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:03,414
with a clear conscience
and an honest soul.

424
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,009
Please say
that you understand, Anne!

425
00:33:08,402 --> 00:33:09,402
Please.

426
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,464
Forward! Come on! Left, right.

427
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,624
There we are!

428
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,880
Shit!

429
00:33:30,655 --> 00:33:32,010
It can't last forever.

430
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:34,687
Lads, come here!

431
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,540
Come on!

432
00:33:42,764 --> 00:33:43,827
Move on, men!

433
00:33:49,603 --> 00:33:50,760
This way, My Lord.

434
00:33:55,969 --> 00:33:58,323
Your Majesty, signor Treviso.

435
00:33:58,727 --> 00:33:59,727
Girolamo.

436
00:34:01,511 --> 00:34:04,322
Come, show me where you intend
to dig these mines.

437
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:07,815
I intend to dig three tunnels.

438
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,580
Two will be a diversion,
to confuse the enemy.

439
00:34:10,747 --> 00:34:14,523
The main one will be here,
which will lead under the castle.

440
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:15,722
How long?

441
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,848
That depends on the type of ground,
danger of flooding and so on.

442
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:22,340
Also, how far into the earth
they have built the walls.

443
00:34:22,582 --> 00:34:24,346
But I say we could
be under the castle

444
00:34:24,513 --> 00:34:26,840
and able to detonate
a huge explosion in three weeks.

445
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:29,756
Two weeks, signor Treviso!

446
00:34:31,023 --> 00:34:32,058
Two weeks!

447
00:34:32,678 --> 00:34:34,144
Take the troops you need.

448
00:34:43,595 --> 00:34:45,142
Put your backs into it, men.

449
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,033
We are making excellent progress.

450
00:35:30,266 --> 00:35:33,460
But I want to know how the Emperor
is doing since we are in this war.

451
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,220
The Emperor's forces
are at present besieging

452
00:35:36,391 --> 00:35:38,570
the fortresses of Luxembourg
and St. Didier.

453
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,986
With God's help, we will break
our siege first and advance on Paris.

454
00:35:42,153 --> 00:35:44,042
With the damage our guns
are inflicting,

455
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:46,676
I swear Boulogne will
not hold out for long.

456
00:35:47,121 --> 00:35:50,605
I think that the French were foolish to
think that their walls were invincible.

457
00:35:50,772 --> 00:35:52,189
They had not seen our guns.

458
00:36:17,932 --> 00:36:20,275
Paris by September! Good!

459
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,389
There are a lot of Frenchmen
in Paris I would like to kill,

460
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:26,648
so I can sleep with their wives
with a clear conscience!

461
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:28,416
Gentlemen

462
00:36:30,028 --> 00:36:31,606
- <i>Salut!</i>
- <i>Salut!</i>

463
00:36:34,242 --> 00:36:35,692
- Majesty.
- What is it?

464
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,624
The French! They've broken out
beyond the southern gate, sir.

465
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,690
- I'll go!
- Your Grace!

466
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:44,118
Cover the gates with a massive force,
in case this is a diversion.

467
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:45,658
- Go!
- Majesty.

468
00:36:58,811 --> 00:37:00,061
Where are they?

469
00:37:29,172 --> 00:37:31,753
There, there! Get him!

470
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,642
Stop in the name of the King!

471
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,867
- Where is he?
- He's down in the ditch!

472
00:38:08,415 --> 00:38:09,912
Keep your wits about you.

473
00:38:15,618 --> 00:38:16,544
Take cover!

474
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:20,209
Stay down!

475
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:24,875
- Do you see him?
- Two on the ground!

476
00:38:47,574 --> 00:38:48,618
Ready!

477
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:49,868
Let's go!

478
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,890
Your Grace,

479
00:39:03,227 --> 00:39:05,551
I didn't need your help
but thank you all the same.

480
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,906
Shall I leave them to you then?

481
00:39:13,073 --> 00:39:14,710
Here we come!

482
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,122
For England!

483
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,900
Mademoiselle?

484
00:41:02,192 --> 00:41:03,210
Load cannon!

485
00:41:06,382 --> 00:41:08,561
- General.
- Keep the lines straight.

486
00:41:08,955 --> 00:41:10,032
Dig in there.

487
00:41:17,874 --> 00:41:19,736
I've brought you some food.

488
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:27,943
Your father is still alive.

489
00:41:33,526 --> 00:41:34,537
Is that true?

490
00:41:34,704 --> 00:41:36,603
He was wounded
but we're taking care of him.

491
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,305
- Can I see him?
- Soon.

492
00:41:39,085 --> 00:41:40,085
I promise.

493
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,140
<i>Put your backs into it.
Roll that barrel!</i>

494
00:41:46,146 --> 00:41:47,195
What's your name?

495
00:41:48,971 --> 00:41:49,971
Brigitte,

496
00:41:50,766 --> 00:41:51,963
Brigitte Rousselot.

497
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:54,543
You should eat.

498
00:41:56,787 --> 00:41:58,322
Why are you here?

499
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,442
In France?
This isn't your country.

500
00:42:02,524 --> 00:42:03,668
It used to be.

501
00:42:04,646 --> 00:42:07,691
We all used to live in Eden.
It doesn't mean we can go back again!

502
00:42:10,854 --> 00:42:13,647
- Why won't you release me?
- So you'll fight against us?

503
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,080
Yes! So I can go on killing you.

504
00:42:16,873 --> 00:42:19,241
No, Mademoiselle.
You're my prisoner now.

505
00:42:20,381 --> 00:42:22,399
Perhaps I'll even get
a ransom for you!

506
00:42:26,682 --> 00:42:28,170
How things are in the town?

507
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,798
Do people have enough food?

508
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,549
They have plenty!
You shouldn't worry about them.

509
00:42:33,716 --> 00:42:35,136
They'll never surrender.

510
00:42:35,632 --> 00:42:38,277
Not to that sacred monster,
your King.

511
00:42:38,665 --> 00:42:39,473
Monster?

512
00:42:45,154 --> 00:42:47,604
You know
we call him the English Nero!

513
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:49,801
Didn't you know that?

514
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:59,293
<i>Graci plena. Dominus tecum.</i>

515
00:43:00,894 --> 00:43:04,443
<i>Benedicta tu in mulieribus,</i>

516
00:43:05,694 --> 00:43:08,915
<i>et benedictus fructus ventris tui.</i>

517
00:43:17,545 --> 00:43:18,595
Mr. Risley.

518
00:43:19,116 --> 00:43:20,166
Your Grace,

519
00:43:24,538 --> 00:43:27,709
I have some news I thought
you might be interested in.

520
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:29,273
It seems

521
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:33,527
Queen Catherine has appointed
Hugh Latimer as her private Chaplain.

522
00:43:34,626 --> 00:43:35,686
Are you sure?

523
00:43:39,078 --> 00:43:42,755
And I thought someone said
she was an intelligent woman!

524
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,380
How's the tunnelling?

525
00:43:54,233 --> 00:43:55,900
We've dug about 50 paces.

526
00:43:57,432 --> 00:44:00,221
It's bloody hard work,
and there's a lot of clay.

527
00:44:01,028 --> 00:44:02,973
I prefer the clay.
It's not like sand.

528
00:44:03,613 --> 00:44:06,101
Always afraid it's gonna collapse
and bury you.

529
00:44:07,767 --> 00:44:08,956
How've you been?

530
00:44:09,968 --> 00:44:12,482
There's a French officer
comes out sometimes.

531
00:44:12,965 --> 00:44:15,780
He stands for a few moments
on the castle rampart,

532
00:44:15,947 --> 00:44:17,147
looking at us.

533
00:44:18,145 --> 00:44:19,904
Then he goes back inside.

534
00:44:21,635 --> 00:44:23,275
I just need one good shot.

535
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:25,864
One good shot.

536
00:44:30,939 --> 00:44:31,961
Have you heard?

537
00:44:32,829 --> 00:44:35,319
There are meant to be
a few women around camp.

538
00:44:35,705 --> 00:44:37,424
Not many, mind. Just a few.

539
00:44:38,985 --> 00:44:40,257
That's what I heard.

540
00:44:40,424 --> 00:44:41,720
If you fancy the pox!

541
00:44:46,047 --> 00:44:47,536
Perhaps you're right.

542
00:44:49,245 --> 00:44:51,716
In any case, I have a wife back home

543
00:44:52,495 --> 00:44:53,816
and she is with child.

544
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,276
What do you want, a boy or girl?

545
00:44:58,667 --> 00:44:59,667
A boy.

546
00:45:03,893 --> 00:45:06,343
I hope to God
we're not here too long.

547
00:45:14,139 --> 00:45:17,117
"Although Your Majesty's absence
has not been long,

548
00:45:17,395 --> 00:45:19,023
"yet the want of your presence

549
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:21,599
"means that I cannot
take pleasure in anything

550
00:45:22,478 --> 00:45:24,221
"until I hear from Your Majesty."

551
00:45:26,405 --> 00:45:27,980
"Time hangs heavily."

552
00:45:28,234 --> 00:45:29,869
"I have a great desire to know

553
00:45:30,036 --> 00:45:32,292
"how Your Majesty has done
since you left."

554
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:34,917
"For your prosperity and health,

555
00:45:35,084 --> 00:45:37,995
"I prefer and desire
more than my own."

556
00:45:40,118 --> 00:45:43,490
"And although I know Your Majesty's
absence is never without great need

557
00:45:44,856 --> 00:45:47,573
"still, love and affection compel me

558
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,407
"to desire your presence."

559
00:45:52,923 --> 00:45:56,241
"Thus love makes me set aside
my own convenience

560
00:45:56,408 --> 00:45:58,008
"and pleasure for you,

561
00:45:58,477 --> 00:46:02,290
"at whose hands I have received
so much love and goodness

562
00:46:02,714 --> 00:46:04,720
"that words cannot express it."

563
00:46:11,488 --> 00:46:14,341
"We hear word of ill weather

564
00:46:14,508 --> 00:46:16,244
"and delays besetting you."

565
00:46:18,813 --> 00:46:21,437
"And though we thank God
for your good health,

566
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,448
"we anxiously await the joyous news

567
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:27,126
"of the success
of your great venture

568
00:46:28,356 --> 00:46:31,073
"and for your safe
and triumphant return,

569
00:46:32,303 --> 00:46:35,337
"for which all England
offers daily prayers."

570
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,295
<i>More supports in the space!</i>

571
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:46,355
"I fear I am but a poor substitute
for Your Majesty

572
00:46:46,943 --> 00:46:49,787
"in the matter of the guidance
of your kingdom."

573
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:52,840
"I long for your return."

574
00:47:00,626 --> 00:47:03,570
"I commit you to God's care
and governance."

575
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:09,870
"By Your Majesty's humble,
obedient wife

576
00:47:10,728 --> 00:47:13,939
"and servant, Catherine the Queen."

577
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:53,039
But, Majesty, I beg you
to give us a little more time.

578
00:48:53,803 --> 00:48:56,263
The men are working
all day and all night.

579
00:48:56,714 --> 00:48:59,763
But sometimes we must stop
digging to support the roof

580
00:49:00,078 --> 00:49:01,980
or else everything collapses.

581
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:04,958
Master Surgeon!

582
00:49:08,477 --> 00:49:09,546
Signor Treviso.

583
00:49:13,455 --> 00:49:15,095
- What is it?
- Majesty,

584
00:49:17,425 --> 00:49:20,924
I regret to inform you of the deaths
of ten of your soldiers.

585
00:49:21,984 --> 00:49:25,001
- Soldier die of their wounds.
- No, Your Majesty.

586
00:49:25,168 --> 00:49:27,839
The men all died of the bloody flux.

587
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:31,415
Dysentery?

588
00:49:33,793 --> 00:49:36,557
I am afraid there is an outbreak
of the disease throughout your army.

589
00:49:37,526 --> 00:49:39,671
God alone knows
how many it will take away.

590
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:48,569
Master Surgeon.

591
00:49:52,516 --> 00:49:53,616
Mr. Treviso.

592
00:50:08,219 --> 00:50:09,881
Let me ask you something.

593
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:15,220
What do you think of our Italian
gentleman, signor Girolamo Treviso?

594
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,841
The builder of tunnels.

595
00:50:18,996 --> 00:50:21,693
- What do you mean?
- I mean do you trust him?

596
00:50:22,923 --> 00:50:24,508
Why should I not trust him?

597
00:50:25,438 --> 00:50:28,567
It's only that I happen to know
that, some time ago,

598
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,819
he said he could build a mirror
large enough

599
00:50:31,986 --> 00:50:34,364
that if set upon the cliffs of Dover

600
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:38,131
His Majesty would be able to see,
reflected in it,

601
00:50:38,882 --> 00:50:40,700
the movement of French ships

602
00:50:41,486 --> 00:50:43,736
in and out of the port of Boulogne.

603
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,170
Do you see what I mean, Your Grace?

604
00:50:49,676 --> 00:50:51,006
Do you think he's mad?

605
00:50:52,918 --> 00:50:54,568
It's only a suggestion.

606
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:56,610
But then,

607
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,124
he's not the only one!

608
00:51:10,284 --> 00:51:11,943
<i>Change the watch!</i>

609
00:51:42,945 --> 00:51:44,951
<i>Section ready!</i>

610
00:51:46,087 --> 00:51:47,345
<i>Pull me up!</i>

611
00:51:49,404 --> 00:51:50,976
<i>Ready captain!</i>
