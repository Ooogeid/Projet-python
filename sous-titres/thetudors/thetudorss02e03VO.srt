2
00:00:01,736 --> 00:00:05,360
I demand to know whose
subjects are you:

3
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:06,916
The pope's, or mine?

4
00:00:06,986 --> 00:00:10,656
Here is submission of the
clergy, to your majesty's will.

5
00:00:10,773 --> 00:00:14,495
- The church is broken.
- If I would weep, sir thomas, I would weep

6
00:00:14,672 --> 00:00:16,000
tears of blood.

7
00:00:16,078 --> 00:00:18,551
His majesty clearly thinks that
you are destined for better things.

8
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:22,539
Which is why he has appointed you his
special envoy to the court of the emperor.

9
00:00:22,617 --> 00:00:24,807
I've received a letter
from our friend Cranmer.

10
00:00:24,889 --> 00:00:27,171
In Nurnberg, clergy
are allowed to marry.

11
00:00:27,249 --> 00:00:29,881
And mr. Cranmer has taken
full advantage of that fact.

12
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:32,030
- Lady Elizabeth.
- What do you want?

13
00:00:32,202 --> 00:00:33,421
You know what I want.

14
00:00:33,577 --> 00:00:35,077
Are you really going to
marry mistress Boleyn?

15
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,991
I have it on very good authority that
she and Thomas Wyatt were once lovers.

16
00:00:38,116 --> 00:00:41,074
- She denies it.
- Well, she would, wouldn't she?

17
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:43,280
I said she denies it!

18
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:45,498
What of this girl,
the king's whore?

19
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,920
Why doesn't someone
just get rid of her?

20
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,724
If you succeed, you will
be the beloved of god,

21
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:52,740
of his holiness,
and of the emperor.

22
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:56,053
There are rumours that your grace
secretly supports the queen.

23
00:00:56,135 --> 00:00:58,421
- So what happened to you?
- I grew up.

24
00:00:58,537 --> 00:01:01,678
I come to offer my resignation
for my post as chancellor.

25
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,739
I promise that I will never speak
publicly of your majesty's great matter.

26
00:01:05,845 --> 00:01:07,849
I will hold you
to that promise.

27
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,792
We have a duty still to act in
the interests of christendom.

28
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:12,201
Whatever the cost.

29
00:01:12,302 --> 00:01:16,954
I promise you that the thing I have so
longed for will be accomplished here.

30
00:01:17,068 --> 00:01:20,708
Now, my love, let me conceive.
And we will have a son.

31
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,458
His majesty commands that
you be gone from this place.

32
00:01:23,536 --> 00:01:26,036
Wherever I go,
I remain his wife.

33
00:01:26,145 --> 00:01:31,018
I beseech your highness not to pursue
the path you seem to be taking.

34
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:35,714
Or you will surely follow Ahab,
who married the whore Jezebel!

35
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:38,456
The dogs will lick your blood!

The Tudors - Season 02
Episode 03

39
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:16,778
- Pennington!
- Ah, the Southwells!

40
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:19,824
How's your master, Boleyn?

41
00:03:19,956 --> 00:03:22,212
That's Lord Rochford
to you, Pennington.

42
00:03:22,488 --> 00:03:24,988
Sir William Pennington
to you, Southwell.

43
00:03:25,457 --> 00:03:28,788
And how is your master?
Master fucking Brandon?

44
00:03:29,187 --> 00:03:32,018
Does he still persist in using the
most foul and abusive language

45
00:03:32,143 --> 00:03:34,277
against my master's
daughter, Lady Anne.

46
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:36,807
- who is soon to be queen?
- The duke can speak for himself.

47
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:38,338
I'm asking you, Pennington!

48
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:42,013
His grace wants nothing to do with
the elevation of the king's whore!

49
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:43,760
Who's a whore?

50
00:03:44,627 --> 00:03:47,451
- Let me pass!
- Not till you've paid for that.

51
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,181
Run! Fetch the duke! Go!

52
00:04:17,037 --> 00:04:19,381
Father, I seek sanctuary
in this place.

53
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,168
Of course, my child.

54
00:04:23,256 --> 00:04:26,412
Put up your swords, gentlemen.
This is a place of god.

55
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:28,792
Defend yourself, Pennington.

56
00:04:28,957 --> 00:04:30,143
Dear god!

57
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,049
You dishonour the Boleyn
family whom you serve.

58
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:36,864
And you offend god by
offering violence here.

59
00:04:39,254 --> 00:04:40,252
Stop it.

60
00:04:40,755 --> 00:04:43,692
Stop now, for the
love of god!

61
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:45,521
Enough is enough!

62
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,439
You fool, Richard.
You've killed him!

63
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:17,511
Oh, my lord.

64
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,714
They've killed him.

65
00:05:22,549 --> 00:05:23,893
Murderers!

66
00:05:23,987 --> 00:05:27,299
Oh my lord, my lord, I beg
you, in the name of our lord.

67
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:29,877
One murder has been
committed here already.

68
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,376
You scum.

69
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,564
- Your grace, we...
- Shut up!

70
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:37,411
- You're both dead men.
- My lord, listen! I beg you.

71
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:41,779
Those who commit murder in church
are damned in the eyes of god.

72
00:05:53,982 --> 00:05:55,856
This is your doing, Boleyn!

73
00:06:09,431 --> 00:06:11,837
Lady Anne is not
to be disturbed.

74
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:15,915
Suddenly everyone is beating
a path to Lady Anne's door!

75
00:06:16,564 --> 00:06:18,314
Why do you suppose
that is, mr. Wyatt?

76
00:06:18,455 --> 00:06:22,173
Because everyone prefers a rising
sun to a setting sun, mr. Smeaton.

77
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:26,528
Now tell me, what are
you writing at the moment?

78
00:06:26,606 --> 00:06:28,075
A satire.

79
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:30,297
You find all this funny?

80
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:33,511
Well, it has its funny side,
like all serious things.

81
00:06:34,422 --> 00:06:37,406
For example and this will
make you laugh, Mark.

82
00:06:37,578 --> 00:06:40,812
Mr. Cromwell just told me I've been
appointed to the privy council.

83
00:06:40,938 --> 00:06:42,297
That's ridiculous.

84
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,844
Everything in
life is ridiculous.

85
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:46,953
And to suppose
otherwise is...

86
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:49,961
- It's human vanity.
- Mr. Wyatt.

87
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:51,176
My lady.

88
00:06:51,683 --> 00:06:53,792
- You know what?
- No, I don't

89
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:57,456
I have a furious
hankering for apples,

90
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:01,159
such as I've never had before.
It started three days ago.

91
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:02,397
Apples?

92
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:04,604
Yes! Apples.

93
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:07,832
The king told me it was a
sign I was pregnant, but

94
00:07:07,997 --> 00:07:10,224
I said it was
nothing of the sort.

95
00:07:13,803 --> 00:07:15,471
What was that about?

96
00:07:18,482 --> 00:07:20,044
What news from france?

97
00:07:20,842 --> 00:07:23,763
None to give your
majesty any satisfaction.

98
00:07:23,825 --> 00:07:27,660
Although he promised to make representations
to the pope on your majesty's behalf.

99
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,664
King Francis did no such thing.

100
00:07:30,097 --> 00:07:31,457
It doesn't matter.

101
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:35,194
What else should we have expected
from the king of France?

102
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:39,402
The fact is, I now have a good
reason... a very good reason,

103
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:41,585
not to wait for the pope's decision.

104
00:07:41,784 --> 00:07:44,867
The annulment of my marriage
must be declared immediately.

105
00:07:46,688 --> 00:07:49,498
Well, as your majesty is
head of the church now,

106
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:51,338
- you yourself could...
- No.

107
00:07:51,691 --> 00:07:55,701
The annulment should still be decided
and declared by the church proper.

108
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:59,201
That is to say,
the Archbishop of Canterbury.

109
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:04,886
As your majesty knows, there
remains a vacancy for that position.

110
00:08:05,704 --> 00:08:07,759
I think I know exactly who will suit.

111
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,458
Mr. Cranmer!

112
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:15,661
Yes.

113
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:18,568
- Your belongings from Germany.
- Thank you.

114
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:22,504
If you could just...
thank you, sir. At last.

115
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:33,119
Katharina.

116
00:08:34,463 --> 00:08:35,572
It's over now.

117
00:08:36,322 --> 00:08:37,603
You're here.

118
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,521
I'm very relieved to see you, Thomas.
I thought I was going to die!

119
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,911
It's not the nicest way to travel,
even for an illegal wife!

120
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,801
It's over now.

121
00:08:54,048 --> 00:08:55,817
You're here now.

122
00:08:57,442 --> 00:08:59,067
Do you forgive me?

123
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:15,580
So...

124
00:09:16,408 --> 00:09:17,975
This is England?

125
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:20,593
This is England.

126
00:09:23,674 --> 00:09:26,618
They want to make
Cranmer archbishop.

127
00:09:27,646 --> 00:09:31,316
I wonder if the pope knows of
the reputation Cranmer has here

128
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:34,622
for being devoted heart and
soul to the lutheran movement.

129
00:09:35,497 --> 00:09:37,685
He was once chaplain
to the Boleyns.

130
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:41,435
He ought to be required to take a special
oath not to meddle with the divorce.

131
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:44,216
Of course he'll meddle!
That's what they want!

132
00:09:45,022 --> 00:09:47,256
They don't care about
holy curch anymore.

133
00:09:47,974 --> 00:09:49,693
They don't even care
about the people.

134
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:52,606
The king, in his blindness,
fears no one but god.

135
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:54,412
I fear for the queen.

136
00:09:55,701 --> 00:09:59,310
They say Anne Boleyn hates her
openly and her daughter, too.

137
00:10:00,536 --> 00:10:02,677
She's made threats
against the child.

138
00:10:03,262 --> 00:10:05,090
Those are
dangerous words.

139
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:09,270
Think also of the lives
of your own children.

140
00:10:30,326 --> 00:10:31,700
What is this?

141
00:10:31,953 --> 00:10:35,148
The bull "Sublimus Dei", holy father.

142
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:39,195
Remind me.

143
00:10:39,749 --> 00:10:44,218
It forbids the enslavement of the
native peoples of the new world.

144
00:10:46,217 --> 00:10:50,162
Then we sign it very willingly.
For the fact is, Campeggio,

145
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:54,552
that the kings of europe
have power but no morality.

146
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:57,529
I must act as
their conscience.

147
00:10:57,771 --> 00:11:01,196
They are my wilful children
and I their father,

148
00:11:01,305 --> 00:11:05,295
leading them along the
paths of righteousness.

149
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:09,066
So help me god.

150
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,010
And this?

151
00:11:21,126 --> 00:11:25,165
The king of England asks your approval
to appoint a new archbishop of Canterbury,

152
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:28,142
after the death of
archbishop Warham.

153
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,698
And people say
he doesn't care!

154
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:36,479
- What is the name of the candidate?
- Thomas Cranmer.

155
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:39,557
What do we know of this Cranmer?

156
00:11:39,804 --> 00:11:41,471
Virtually nothing.

157
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:45,260
He's an obscure cleric.
A nobody.

158
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:49,471
There are strong rumors that
he is a secret lutheran.

159
00:11:50,436 --> 00:11:53,299
Then we should not approve
his appointment.

160
00:11:53,424 --> 00:11:56,908
No. Not in my opinion,
holiness.

161
00:11:57,854 --> 00:11:59,206
And yet...

162
00:12:00,244 --> 00:12:03,643
we want to give the english church
the opportunity to return

163
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:07,103
to its first allegiance,
and our true faith.

164
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,728
We want to please the king.

165
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:15,056
We want to make
him beholden to us.

166
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:21,516
What better way to please him than to
approve the appointment of a nobody?

167
00:12:22,172 --> 00:12:23,625
After all,

168
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:29,125
what harm can a nobody
inflict upon our holy church?

169
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:56,779
Your grace.

170
00:12:57,505 --> 00:13:00,364
We are most pleased to see
you confirmed as archbishop.

171
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:06,945
Your majesty, I confess I had some
scruples about accepting the office,

172
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:10,255
since I must receive
it at the pope's hand.

173
00:13:10,674 --> 00:13:12,465
You are not beholden to Rome.

174
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:16,255
Only to god. And me.

175
00:13:18,141 --> 00:13:21,741
And now, archbishop, as principle minister
of spiritual jurisdiction in our realm,

176
00:13:21,808 --> 00:13:24,093
I ask you to determine
once and for all,

177
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:26,246
my great matter.

178
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,960
Whether or not my first
marriage was valid.

179
00:13:31,484 --> 00:13:34,512
Majesty, I shall address the
question with the greatest urgency,

180
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:37,284
and presently pronounce my verdict.

181
00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:49,484
- Mr. Cromwell.
- Majesty?

182
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:53,737
Since the departure of Thomas More,
England has lacked a chancellor.

183
00:13:56,299 --> 00:13:59,289
I am trusting you to
fill that office.

184
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,737
Majesty.

185
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:20,665
Where is he? Where's Suffolk?

186
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:39,078
We are gathered here together,
in the sight of god almighty,

187
00:14:40,554 --> 00:14:44,878
to join in holy matrimony,
this man and this woman.

188
00:14:45,764 --> 00:14:49,630
And will you both answer that you will
keep all these coming days rightful,

189
00:14:50,488 --> 00:14:55,802
with rightwiseness and
discretion, with mercy and truth.

190
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:58,183
So help you god.

191
00:15:03,383 --> 00:15:04,773
Master Brereton.

192
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:10,840
It's no use. I failed.

193
00:15:12,154 --> 00:15:14,097
And I can no longer
bear this place.

194
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:19,802
Then go where your heart tells you.

195
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:24,535
With god's blessing.

196
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:49,930
- My lady...
- The Duke of Suffolk.

197
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,845
Your grace.

198
00:15:58,978 --> 00:16:00,026
My lady...

199
00:16:04,226 --> 00:16:07,236
his majesty has ordered me here.
He's asked me to tell you...

200
00:16:08,493 --> 00:16:11,159
He warns you not to try
to return to him...

201
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:15,407
since he is now married
to the Lady Anne.

202
00:16:16,883 --> 00:16:19,378
From henceforth, you must substain
from using the title of queen.

203
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,302
You will now be referred to as
the princess dowager of Wales.

204
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:29,665
You must also cut your
household expenses.

205
00:16:33,532 --> 00:16:36,675
In his generosity, the king
allows you to keep your property,

206
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:40,123
but will no longer pay
your servants' wages,

207
00:16:41,037 --> 00:16:42,675
or your household expenses.

208
00:16:45,475 --> 00:16:47,132
And what of my daughter?

209
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:50,418
- What of Mary? May I see her?
- Madam.

210
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,301
Forgive me.

211
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,120
You know something, mister Brandon?

212
00:17:09,482 --> 00:17:15,063
If I had to choose between extreme
happiness and extreme sorrow...

213
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:18,339
I would always choose sorrow.

214
00:17:23,434 --> 00:17:25,339
For when you are
happy you forget...

215
00:17:26,063 --> 00:17:29,053
you forget about spiritual
things; you forget about god.

216
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,139
But in your sorrow...

217
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:36,672
he is always with you.

218
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:47,758
May lord bless you and
keep you, my lady.

219
00:18:18,368 --> 00:18:22,120
As long as I live,
I will call myself

220
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:24,958
the queen of England.

221
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:30,558
- Deo gracias.
- Amen.

222
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:39,987
Your grace, I have some news.

223
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:44,006
I have learned that signor Cromwell is
to present another bill to parliament.

224
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:46,710
The act of restraint of appeals.

225
00:18:47,282 --> 00:18:51,282
And under its innocuous title does it
conceal its most revolutionary intent.

226
00:18:51,491 --> 00:18:53,034
What does it say?

227
00:18:55,034 --> 00:19:00,768
"This realm of england is an empire,
"governed by one supreme head and king,

228
00:19:01,063 --> 00:19:03,558
and owing no allegiance
except to god."

229
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:08,796
In future, all final appeals on spiritual
matters will be heard, not in Rome,

230
00:19:09,187 --> 00:19:12,920
but in England, where the
king will now enjoy...

231
00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:18,958
"plenary, whole and entire power, pre-eminence,
"authority, prerogative and jurisdiction."

232
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:21,358
Which means, I take it,

233
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,339
that the act prohibits the hearing of
the king's nullity suit by the pope.

234
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,844
And, by the same token,
bars the queen

235
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:32,901
- from appealing to the vatican against
any decision made here. - Exactly.

236
00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:36,939
No english sovereign has ever
been granted such absolute power.

237
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,053
- Poor Katherine.
- It's worse.

238
00:19:39,168 --> 00:19:42,768
- There are rumours that the king
has married Anne in secret. - No!

239
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,729
And that she is already with child.

240
00:19:46,825 --> 00:19:52,577
Your eminences. At the conclusion of this
properly constituted ecclesiastical court,

241
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:56,520
I am ready to pronounce the
verdict agreed by us all.

242
00:19:57,936 --> 00:20:02,888
It is a pity that certain persons
refused to come here and testify!

243
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:07,459
But that in itself holds no
bearing upon our conclusions.

244
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,793
Which are: That the union
between king Henry of England

245
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:16,631
and Katherine of Aragon is
declared null and void.

246
00:20:16,745 --> 00:20:21,659
And therefore, that the king's marriage
to Anne Boleyn is declared both valid

247
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:25,755
and lawful, in the eyes of god.

248
00:20:32,806 --> 00:20:33,587
Sir.

249
00:20:40,883 --> 00:20:42,787
- Elizabeth?
- Not that.

250
00:20:44,835 --> 00:20:48,263
- Then what?
- I came on behalf of my lady,

251
00:20:49,397 --> 00:20:51,130
though not with her permission.

252
00:20:53,949 --> 00:20:56,235
Thomas, she is in a
most wretched way...

253
00:20:57,949 --> 00:20:59,949
abandoned and betrayed.

254
00:21:00,673 --> 00:21:04,921
It seems so cruel of the king
to humiliate her in every way,

255
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:07,435
pretending to marry that Harlot...

256
00:21:09,073 --> 00:21:09,892
What?

257
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:12,406
Did you not know?

258
00:21:13,435 --> 00:21:19,187
The duke of Suffolk came to tell
her that the king has married...

259
00:21:19,968 --> 00:21:20,844
Anne?

260
00:21:21,968 --> 00:21:22,844
Boleyn?

261
00:21:32,911 --> 00:21:34,454
But what can I do
about any of that?

262
00:21:35,102 --> 00:21:37,216
You are now a privy councillor.

263
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:42,587
And a client of mister Cromwell. I thought
you could speak up for my mistress.

264
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:46,096
Mister Cromwell is the least likely
man to sympathise with your mistress.

265
00:21:46,146 --> 00:21:47,436
You must know that, Elizabeth.

266
00:21:49,168 --> 00:21:50,483
But what about you?

267
00:21:52,254 --> 00:21:55,378
If you still have feelings for me,
you will speak out for her.

268
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,368
I'm sorry.

269
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:45,485
As the successor of st. Peter,

270
00:22:46,647 --> 00:22:52,361
I do solemnly condemn the separation of the
king of England from Katherine of Aragon,

271
00:22:53,466 --> 00:22:56,076
and his subsequent secret marriage,

272
00:22:56,628 --> 00:22:59,618
which I declare null and void.

273
00:23:00,818 --> 00:23:02,114
This matter,

274
00:23:02,723 --> 00:23:05,942
of the validity of his
majesty's marriage,

275
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:12,523
can only be decided by the curia,
which has not yet reached its conclusion.

276
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:19,637
I will give the king until september
to take back his former wife...

277
00:23:20,847 --> 00:23:24,333
on pain of excommunication,

278
00:23:24,818 --> 00:23:27,942
which is separation
from holy church,

279
00:23:29,056 --> 00:23:30,656
from communion,

280
00:23:32,047 --> 00:23:34,047
and from god.

281
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,609
Thank you, your excellencies.
You may communicate my words

282
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,371
to your masters everywhere.

283
00:23:43,618 --> 00:23:45,333
Come with me, master Brereton.

284
00:23:57,991 --> 00:24:01,362
Holy father, this is the young english
gentleman I was telling you about,

285
00:24:01,677 --> 00:24:03,772
who brought us the news
from the English court.

286
00:24:04,115 --> 00:24:05,867
Master William Brereton.

287
00:24:06,896 --> 00:24:08,248
My son.

288
00:24:12,229 --> 00:24:16,319
We are grateful to you for bringing
news of these terrible events

289
00:24:16,376 --> 00:24:19,500
and for all you tried
to do to prevent them.

290
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:23,976
I tried to rid you of her, but
unfortunately, holy father I failed.

291
00:24:24,967 --> 00:24:30,014
Who knows, my son? God
works in mysterious ways.

292
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:37,948
Cardinal Campeggio tells me you want to stay
in Rome now, and not return to England.

293
00:24:38,234 --> 00:24:39,510
Is that correct?

294
00:24:40,557 --> 00:24:41,738
Yes, holy father.

295
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:47,853
I would rather remain with
the flock of the faithful.

296
00:24:52,614 --> 00:24:55,243
Recently, master Brereton,

297
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:59,205
I have ordained a new and
very special holy order.

298
00:24:59,814 --> 00:25:04,995
They are the militantis ecclesiae.
the soldiers of christ.

299
00:25:05,681 --> 00:25:10,234
These jesuits, as they are
called, these soldiers,

300
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,062
will go where others fear,

301
00:25:13,643 --> 00:25:16,576
where often they will
meet great danger,

302
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:19,295
in order to promote the catholic faith

303
00:25:19,396 --> 00:25:23,696
 and take the word of god
to heathens and heretics.

304
00:25:24,614 --> 00:25:29,091
I see already your passion for
this cause, and I beg you,

305
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:31,910
join the order,

306
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:35,205
join the crusade against heresy,

307
00:25:35,757 --> 00:25:40,329
and return to England,
even at the risk of martyrdom.

308
00:25:51,394 --> 00:25:55,353
- Mister Cromwell.
- Majesty?

309
00:26:03,806 --> 00:26:05,704
How are the preparations
for the coronation?

310
00:26:05,742 --> 00:26:07,520
They're going well, majesty.

311
00:26:15,523 --> 00:26:17,965
I want the people
to love their new queen

312
00:26:19,305 --> 00:26:20,420
as I love her.

313
00:26:21,434 --> 00:26:22,924
And if I can love her,

314
00:26:23,713 --> 00:26:25,066
why shouldn't they?

315
00:26:27,157 --> 00:26:29,574
I assure your majesty
they will love her,

316
00:26:30,326 --> 00:26:32,517
and shall have every reason to do so.

317
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:48,796
Yes, I like it.

318
00:26:50,048 --> 00:26:51,401
Madame la marquise.

319
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,619
No. Just sister.

320
00:26:56,222 --> 00:26:57,600
How are you, sister?

321
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:01,169
How are both of you?

322
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:04,450
We are both very well.

323
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,584
Listen. The king and I have
visited a famous astrologer,

324
00:27:09,848 --> 00:27:13,567
who confirmed what the physicians say,
and what I know in my heart:

325
00:27:14,168 --> 00:27:15,383
That it's a boy.

326
00:27:16,523 --> 00:27:18,639
The king is overjoyed.

327
00:27:18,864 --> 00:27:21,494
He keeps wanting to tell people,
but I tell him not to.

328
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:22,972
Not yet anyway.

329
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:26,115
Come and look at these.

330
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:31,012
Mr. Holbein has been designing all kinds
of things for the coronation procession.

331
00:27:31,663 --> 00:27:33,116
They're so beautiful.

332
00:27:33,592 --> 00:27:35,533
Mr. Holbein is indeed a genius.

333
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,444
Are you scared?

334
00:27:47,505 --> 00:27:48,996
Anne? What is it?

335
00:27:58,213 --> 00:27:59,991
Oh, it's nothing. It's...

336
00:28:08,933 --> 00:28:10,423
what's wrong, husband?

337
00:28:11,601 --> 00:28:15,646
I'm going to have to attend on the king
and that bitch of his at her coronation.

338
00:28:15,683 --> 00:28:17,624
What did Wolsey used to call her?

339
00:28:18,701 --> 00:28:19,966
The black crow!

340
00:28:20,705 --> 00:28:22,847
Can you not plead some indisposition?

341
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:26,879
I could...even though the king
has made me high constable for the day.

342
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,744
But if I did, his majesty would remove my head,
and then I should be genuinely indisposed.

343
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,068
Very well.

344
00:28:33,431 --> 00:28:34,779
So keep your head.

345
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:39,033
It's a pretty head, in any case,
and I don't want to lose it either.

346
00:28:42,197 --> 00:28:44,646
But store up your
knowledge and your anger.

347
00:28:45,232 --> 00:28:47,834
Don't act impulsively,
it's always a mistake.

348
00:28:48,736 --> 00:28:51,748
But one day, with others so
disposed, use them both,

349
00:28:52,627 --> 00:28:56,459
and if you can,
bring her down and destroy her.

350
00:29:23,435 --> 00:29:25,556
Hear ye, hear ye!

351
00:29:26,084 --> 00:29:28,837
Make way for his gracious majesty,

352
00:29:29,095 --> 00:29:32,388
King Henry, and the Lady Anne Boleyn,

353
00:29:33,033 --> 00:29:34,498
Marquess of Pembroke!

354
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,568
Make way, make way!

355
00:29:39,337 --> 00:29:40,778
Where are the crowds?

356
00:29:43,606 --> 00:29:45,024
Where are the people?

357
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,947
- What the hell happened here?
- He's dead! Shot!

358
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:34,806
My god! Keep the procession moving.

359
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:48,549
I can't!

360
00:30:51,748 --> 00:30:53,658
- What was that?
- An accident.

361
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,330
Nothing for your majesty
to be concerned about.

362
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:59,283
For nothing on earth
is going to spoil this day.

363
00:31:03,589 --> 00:31:05,792
Veni, creator

364
00:31:06,027 --> 00:31:09,577
spiritus mentus tuorum  visita.

365
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:15,419
Imple superna gratia
quae tu creasti pectora.

366
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:18,571
Tu septiformis munere,

367
00:31:19,884 --> 00:31:22,391
digitus paternae dexterae;

368
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,265
tu rite promissum patris,

369
00:31:27,061 --> 00:31:29,077
sermone ditans guttura.

370
00:31:30,776 --> 00:31:33,120
Accende lumen sensibus

371
00:31:34,116 --> 00:31:36,823
infundem amorem cordibus

372
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:40,093
in firmans nostri corporis

373
00:31:40,972 --> 00:31:44,476
virtute firmans perpeti.

374
00:31:45,357 --> 00:31:46,423
Amen.

375
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,038
Wait!

376
00:31:58,358 --> 00:31:59,483
Give it to me.

377
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,469
With this,

378
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:11,672
St Edward's crown,

379
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:17,016
I do solemnly crown you
queen of England.

380
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,062
And here...

381
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,991
are the two sceptres of the sovereign.

382
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:45,667
Honour

383
00:32:46,323 --> 00:32:47,331
and grace

384
00:32:47,941 --> 00:32:50,718
be to our queen Anne. May you prosper,

385
00:32:51,644 --> 00:32:52,675
go forward,

386
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:56,202
and may you bear a new
son of the king's blood.

387
00:32:58,124 --> 00:33:00,140
That was an assassination attempt.

388
00:33:01,663 --> 00:33:03,737
either upon you or upon the queen.

389
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:07,380
- A groom was killed.
- Mm-hmm. Thank you, mr. Cromwell.

390
00:33:08,317 --> 00:33:12,477
Sweetheart. How was that?
Did you like the city?

391
00:33:13,736 --> 00:33:16,759
- Was not everything well done?
- Yes, it was beautiful.

392
00:33:18,587 --> 00:33:19,982
But so few people!

393
00:33:20,978 --> 00:33:24,259
And they kept their hats on
their heads. And no one shouted.

394
00:33:27,274 --> 00:33:29,642
It was more like
a funeral than a parade.

395
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:34,919
You have a party to go to.

396
00:33:37,363 --> 00:33:38,910
I want you to be happy.

397
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,008
I want you to smile.

398
00:33:42,098 --> 00:33:44,535
Remember: You are my queen now.

399
00:33:48,578 --> 00:33:49,610
I know.

400
00:33:50,382 --> 00:33:51,671
- But...
- I said:

401
00:33:52,222 --> 00:33:53,570
You are my queen.

402
00:33:57,178 --> 00:33:59,076
Everyone is waiting for you.

403
00:34:30,522 --> 00:34:32,385
I don't see Bishop Fisher here.

404
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,424
No, your majesty.

405
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:36,721
And where is sir Thomas Moore?

406
00:34:37,553 --> 00:34:39,299
I don't see him here either.

407
00:34:40,377 --> 00:34:41,725
Was he not invited?

408
00:34:41,819 --> 00:34:44,338
He was most certainly invited,
your majesty.

409
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,729
Then he chose not to attend.

410
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:55,013
Hungry, ladies?

411
00:35:01,862 --> 00:35:02,893
Your grace.

412
00:35:06,389 --> 00:35:08,978
Since you were appointed
high constable today,

413
00:35:09,142 --> 00:35:11,486
what happened in the
procession was your fault.

414
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,853
I want to know who fired that shot.

415
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:16,706
I am already endeavouring
to find out, my lord.

416
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:21,171
Oh, I sincerely trust
that you are, your grace.

417
00:35:22,718 --> 00:35:24,664
I have not forgotten Pennington.

418
00:35:25,889 --> 00:35:27,940
For I feel that was your fault.

419
00:35:41,661 --> 00:35:43,337
Here's to the Boleyns.

420
00:35:45,622 --> 00:35:46,736
The Boleyns!

421
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:50,661
And England's new queen!

422
00:36:30,748 --> 00:36:34,017
Oh, Mary! And it's all for me!

423
00:36:40,088 --> 00:36:41,599
How was the coronation?

424
00:36:41,857 --> 00:36:45,513
It was a cold, meagre
and uncomfortable thing.

425
00:36:47,341 --> 00:36:49,673
And your absence
was noted, sir Thomas.

426
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,488
How is her majesty
bearing up under all this?

427
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,692
I am no longer allowed to see her.

428
00:36:56,938 --> 00:37:00,172
And it is increasingly difficult
for us to exchange letters.

429
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,090
I'm going to try and see her.

430
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:05,305
That would be so dangerous.

431
00:37:05,774 --> 00:37:08,961
Even to speak a word in her
praise is to risk imprisonment.

432
00:37:09,137 --> 00:37:10,250
Nevertheless.

433
00:37:15,231 --> 00:37:17,457
I have been thinking
about the past,

434
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:21,786
when I believed the king
to be the most enlightened

435
00:37:21,787 --> 00:37:23,587
and promising prince in christendom.

436
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,819
I was sure his reign
would be a golden age.

437
00:37:31,093 --> 00:37:32,663
I had such high hopes...

438
00:37:39,044 --> 00:37:41,775
Bishop Fisher has been
placed under house arrest.

439
00:37:43,371 --> 00:37:45,457
You should beware yourself, Eustace.

440
00:37:55,128 --> 00:37:58,281
You will all be honourable, discreet,

441
00:37:58,773 --> 00:38:01,046
just and thrifty in your conduct.

442
00:38:02,558 --> 00:38:05,289
You will present a
godly spectacle to others,

443
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:10,961
attend mass daily and
display a virtuous demeanour.

444
00:38:13,281 --> 00:38:16,257
On pain of instant
dismissal and banishment,

445
00:38:16,913 --> 00:38:18,413
you must not quarrel,

446
00:38:19,105 --> 00:38:20,124
swear...

447
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:25,140
or say evil and lewd things.
Nor ever behave lewdly.

448
00:38:29,584 --> 00:38:32,806
You will set a standard
for everyone else.

449
00:38:35,241 --> 00:38:36,531
Do you understand?

450
00:38:36,695 --> 00:38:38,113
Yes, your majesty.

451
00:38:43,972 --> 00:38:46,198
And you don't go to brothels.

452
00:38:52,058 --> 00:38:56,324
I will keep here a copy
of Tyndale's english bible.

453
00:38:57,777 --> 00:39:01,527
All of you are free to read it, and
draw spiritual nourishment from it...

454
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,894
for the old days are gone.

455
00:39:06,399 --> 00:39:08,565
Everything is changed now.

456
00:39:09,813 --> 00:39:12,992
Thanks to his majesty,
you have all been delivered

457
00:39:13,137 --> 00:39:19,706
from the darkness and bondage
of papal thraldom, idolatry and superstition.

458
00:39:21,408 --> 00:39:23,889
This is a new beginning.

459
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:31,897
For me. For you.
And for England.

460
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:49,624
Sir.

461
00:39:51,248 --> 00:39:53,414
Lady Mary,

462
00:39:53,798 --> 00:39:56,449
I have come to inform you
of the judgements made recently

463
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,850
by his grace, the archbishop
of canterbury.

464
00:39:59,999 --> 00:40:04,156
His majesty's marriage to your mother
has been declared null and void.

465
00:40:04,557 --> 00:40:06,498
Your mother was never legally
queen of England,

466
00:40:06,499 --> 00:40:09,299
and must now accept the title
of dowager princess.

467
00:40:10,084 --> 00:40:12,723
Just as you have no longer the
right to call yourself princess,

468
00:40:12,724 --> 00:40:16,824
but from now on must be known
to all as lady Mary.

469
00:40:17,508 --> 00:40:21,855
At the same time, his majesty's
recent marriage to queen Anne

470
00:40:21,856 --> 00:40:24,256
has been declared
legal and valid.

471
00:40:24,581 --> 00:40:27,854
Her coronation took place
in london this past week.

472
00:40:27,855 --> 00:40:30,955
I know of no queen of England
save my mother.

473
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:34,730
And I will accept no other
queen, except my mother.

474
00:40:36,738 --> 00:40:40,111
In which case, I have to tell you that
you are forbidden to communicate

475
00:40:40,112 --> 00:40:42,512
in any way with your mother,
from this day forward.

476
00:40:44,878 --> 00:40:46,695
May I not even write to her?

477
00:40:47,524 --> 00:40:49,830
Not even a farewell note,

478
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:55,436
considering your...
intransigence.

479
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,999
Sir Thomas Moore,
my lady.

480
00:41:14,203 --> 00:41:16,264
Sir Thomas.

481
00:41:19,295 --> 00:41:21,006
Your majesty.

482
00:41:21,931 --> 00:41:25,076
Forgive me for
receiving you like this,

483
00:41:25,425 --> 00:41:27,906
but I do not feel well.

484
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:36,018
What you suffer is known to a great
many people, both here and abroad.

485
00:41:36,524 --> 00:41:41,764
As is the injustice of it, as well as
the grace with which you endure it.

486
00:41:43,493 --> 00:41:49,118
Now it seems...
I must cease to call myself queen...

487
00:41:50,532 --> 00:41:54,794
Even though I was crowned so,
and anointed.

488
00:41:55,633 --> 00:41:58,130
They say that if I refuse,

489
00:41:59,073 --> 00:42:03,265
the king will withdraw his
fatherly love for my daughter.

490
00:42:05,518 --> 00:42:08,383
I shall not yield,

491
00:42:09,203 --> 00:42:14,024
neither for my daughter's sake
or anyone else's.

492
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:22,076
Not for a thousand deaths
would I consent to damn my soul,

493
00:42:22,442 --> 00:42:26,600
or that of my husband the king.

494
00:42:30,145 --> 00:42:37,323
Please forgive me again, sir Thomas.
I am not very used to visitors any more.

495
00:42:38,452 --> 00:42:40,793
They are mostly
forbidden me.

496
00:42:41,212 --> 00:42:43,588
How did you get
permission?

497
00:42:44,068 --> 00:42:46,688
I wrote to mr. Cromwell
personally.

498
00:42:47,762 --> 00:42:50,417
Then you are a brave man.

499
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:54,836
I'd be a coward
to do otherwise.

500
00:42:56,094 --> 00:43:00,251
I cannot pretend to be detached
from these events.

501
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:15,143
I have been encouraging
your supporters in parliament,

502
00:43:15,144 --> 00:43:18,544
and elsewhere,
to speak their minds

503
00:43:19,043 --> 00:43:23,821
- and stand up for you.
- Thank you.

504
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:27,664
Sir Thomas. Thank you.

505
00:43:28,004 --> 00:43:30,415
Majesty.

506
00:43:57,125 --> 00:43:58,733
Anne...

507
00:44:08,671 --> 00:44:10,977
sweetheart.

508
00:44:15,517 --> 00:44:17,997
I can't. Not now.

509
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:22,355
While the baby...

510
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:05,015
Exquisite, isn't she?

511
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:15,487
Lady Eleanor Luke. Her family
has an estate in Oxfordshire.

512
00:45:18,927 --> 00:45:21,512
Shall I talk to her
on your behalf?

513
00:45:22,568 --> 00:45:24,559
Naturally.

514
00:46:01,514 --> 00:46:03,365
How do you like life
at court, Mark?

515
00:46:05,007 --> 00:46:09,696
- I feel... I feel twice fortunate, my lord.
- Twice?

516
00:46:09,871 --> 00:46:11,967
Once for being allowed
to come here,

517
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:16,150
and twice for the patronage
of your family.

518
00:46:16,395 --> 00:46:18,316
We like to
patronize artists.

519
00:46:18,691 --> 00:46:22,430
Men of talent. The painter
Holbein stayed with us,

520
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,775
and my sister supports
many musicians and choirs.

521
00:46:26,334 --> 00:46:31,416
Yes, well, your sister is quite
a talented musician herself...

522
00:46:32,324 --> 00:46:35,504
as well as a very beautiful
young woman.

523
00:46:36,568 --> 00:46:41,040
- Even though...
- Even though...?

524
00:46:42,184 --> 00:46:44,455
Not as beautiful
as her brother.

525
00:46:59,676 --> 00:47:01,318
What's this?

526
00:47:01,509 --> 00:47:04,863
The final decision
of the curia in Rome.

527
00:47:29,956 --> 00:47:32,262
They have found for Katherine.

528
00:47:32,837 --> 00:47:38,917
They declare my new marriage invalid, and
any children produced from it, illegitimate.

529
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:42,916
The pope threatens
to excommunicate me

530
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,235
if I do not return to Katherine.

531
00:47:50,549 --> 00:47:53,448
He's too late.

532
00:47:56,644 --> 00:47:57,762
Hold on

533
00:47:58,487 --> 00:48:00,653
Hold on. Hold on.

534
00:48:01,596 --> 00:48:02,714
Hold on

535
00:48:05,386 --> 00:48:07,866
How brave!

536
00:48:09,988 --> 00:48:11,316
Here it comes.

537
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:15,630
And I want you to organize jousts, banquets
and masques to celebrate the birth of my son.

538
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:21,210
I can't decide whether
to call him Henry or Edward.

539
00:48:22,529 --> 00:48:25,699
And I've already asked the french ambassador
to hold him at the font during his christening.

540
00:48:25,934 --> 00:48:28,624
If he drops him, it's war.

541
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:31,340
It's here, it's here.

542
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:36,171
Push! Push.

543
00:48:43,147 --> 00:48:46,867
- What is it? What's happened?
- Nothing! Nothing!

544
00:48:47,111 --> 00:48:51,269
Your majesty has given birth
to a very healthy baby girl

545
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,940
And did you not find such
occurrences shocking, eminency?

546
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,123
Your majesty, I am a venetian.

547
00:49:12,297 --> 00:49:16,664
I come from a city where all the men
are gamblers and all the women whores.

548
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:20,053
What is there to be
shocked about, huh?

549
00:49:21,293 --> 00:49:23,109
Majesty.

550
00:49:46,343 --> 00:49:47,775
Majesty.

551
00:49:58,631 --> 00:50:00,169
I'm so sorry.

552
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,744
You and I are both young,

553
00:50:07,294 --> 00:50:11,032
and by god's grace,
boys will follow.

554
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:44,663
- Lady Eleanor.
- Your majesty.

555
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:04,463
- Do you play chess?
- Yes, your majesty.

556
00:51:06,122 --> 00:51:08,567
Come, let's play.

557
00:51:26,321 --> 00:51:28,522
That's my first move.

558
00:51:28,523 --> 00:51:42,423
