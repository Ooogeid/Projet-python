00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:24,891
Sir Thomas.

4
00:01:24,892 --> 00:01:28,695
- What's the news?
- This matter hangs like a fever

5
00:01:28,696 --> 00:01:30,797
one day good, another bad.

6
00:01:30,798 --> 00:01:34,401
With the promise of a pardon,
and the threat of an advancing

7
00:01:34,402 --> 00:01:37,154
royal army, the rebels in
Lincolnshire have dispersed

8
00:01:37,155 --> 00:01:40,757
- and gone home.
- And in Yorkshire?

9
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:51,385
In Yorkshire and the
whole North we are facing

10
00:01:51,386 --> 00:01:55,389
the most dangerous insurrection
that has ever been seen.

11
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,342
The rebels entered the
town of York three days ago

12
00:01:58,343 --> 00:02:00,827
and celebrated mass in the
cathedral; some say they intend

13
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:04,398
to march South.

14
00:02:24,502 --> 00:02:27,287
- "Your Majesty, I write
to you on an urgent matter.

15
00:02:27,288 --> 00:02:31,058
"We've had word that a
pilgrim army is marching

16
00:02:31,059 --> 00:02:33,210
"on to Pontefract Castle,
which is under my command.

17
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:38,882
"I am compelled to tell you
that I can't defend this castle

18
00:02:38,883 --> 00:02:41,468
"without more soldiers and arms.

19
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:46,123
"As the warden of the East
Marches and a loyal member

20
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,125
"of Your Majesty's council

21
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:52,129
"I beg Your Majesty to consider
negotiating with these pilgrims.

22
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:57,784
I remain your humble and
obedient servant. Darcy."

23
00:03:11,499 --> 00:03:14,651
What is it? What have you found?

24
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,503
A splinter of bone, Your Majesty.

25
00:03:16,504 --> 00:03:20,407
You told me before it was an
ulcer. That it was easily cured!

26
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,409
A wound like this, Your Majesty...

27
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,264
Jesus Christ! You don't know
what it is, do you? Do you?

28
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:30,517
Your Majesty must not be
alarmed. We shall apply

29
00:03:30,518 --> 00:03:32,419
a poultice to draw any more
splinters to the surface.

30
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,422
Then we shall look to other remedies

31
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,074
to heal permanently
Your Majesty's wound.

32
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:41,077
You treat me like a fool.

33
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:44,581
Everyone here treats me like a fool.

34
00:03:44,582 --> 00:03:46,867
Get out.

35
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:51,037
Get out!
- Majesty...

36
00:03:51,038 --> 00:03:53,440
You're quacks and charlatans.

37
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,209
I will find my own remedies.

38
00:04:15,863 --> 00:04:18,965
- Your Grace.
- My Lord,

39
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:21,318
I was promised artillery
when I arrived here.

40
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,970
But I don't see any guns.

41
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:27,624
Your Grace, we have guns but
we have not been unable to find

42
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,476
any horses or drays to transport them.

43
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:33,129
Perhaps you don't understand.

44
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,132
I am about the King's
most urgent business.

45
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:39,135
And if you cannot commandeer
some horses for his Majesty's

46
00:04:39,136 --> 00:04:42,239
use then how can you call
yourself Mayor of London?

47
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,242
Your Grace, I did not want to
produce panic by forcing people

48
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,394
to part with their horses or drays.

49
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:49,513
IDIOT!

50
00:04:49,514 --> 00:04:51,348
I charge you

51
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:54,251
personally to find enough
horses within two days and bring

52
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:58,255
the guns on after our army
- or God help me I will hold you

53
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:02,259
to account. With any luck, Mr.
Mayor, I will afterwards get

54
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,612
the chance to see you
disemboweled at Tyburn!

55
00:05:16,924 --> 00:05:19,276
- Lady Rochford?
- Madam,

56
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:22,879
the King is still confined to his
chambers by his physicians' orders,

57
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,932
but sends his regrets
and hopes you are well.

58
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:31,938
I worry for him so much.
Especially at such a time.

59
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:33,890
Your Majesty is right to do so.

60
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:37,143
These rebels are nothing but villains;

61
00:05:37,144 --> 00:05:40,897
they are totally alienated
from true religion.

62
00:05:40,898 --> 00:05:42,899
They want to take us
back to the dark days

63
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,370
of ignorance and
superstition. And by force!

64
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:50,373
I hope to God they
will soon be overcome.

65
00:05:50,374 --> 00:05:53,376
- Yes. Lady Rochford,

66
00:05:53,377 --> 00:05:55,078
I have something I wish
you to arrange for me.

67
00:05:55,079 --> 00:06:00,216
I'm sure it will give the
King a great deal of pleasure.

68
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:27,344
My God, Lord Darcy.
What a sight is there!

69
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:31,348
Arrant rebels against the King's Majesty

70
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,351
brazenly bearing their badges of shame!

71
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,353
Indeed so, Your Grace.

72
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:41,358
I never thought in all my
long days to see such a sight.

73
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,361
What are you going to do? Fire on them?

74
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,714
You know very well I have
almost no useful guns.

75
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:50,367
You could resist them all the
same, and close your gates.

76
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:54,371
After all those are the King's orders.

77
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:58,725
As to that, I think it
better to talk to them first,

78
00:06:58,726 --> 00:07:02,479
as fellow Englishmen
and fellow Christians.

79
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,033
I'll meet their leaders
outside the castle walls.

80
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:08,902
Guards!

81
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:33,009
- My Lord Darcy, Your Grace, we come here in peace.
- Mr. Aske.

82
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,912
As the King's representative
I have the means here

83
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:40,917
to hinder you and to do
some injury to your cause.

84
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,919
My Lord, we have embarked
upon this Pilgrimage of Grace

85
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,322
for the common good, for the
love we bear to God's faith,

86
00:07:46,323 --> 00:07:48,441
our Holy Church and
the maintenance of it,

87
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:51,928
for the preservation
of our sovereign King

88
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:55,932
and the expulsion of villain's
blood and evil councilors.

89
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,785
We mean to petition the King's highness

90
00:07:58,786 --> 00:08:03,690
to stop the woeful destruction
of our monasteries and abbeys.

91
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:07,343
Master Aske, you claim
to be loyal to the King

92
00:08:07,344 --> 00:08:12,348
but your very actions defy
and deny the King's supremacy!

93
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:16,352
Lord Archbishop, there is
no man now alive in England

94
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:20,223
more loyal to the King than I
am. I trust in time to prove it.

95
00:08:20,224 --> 00:08:23,460
Our quarrel lies not with him, but only

96
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,478
with those close to him.
- It's very well for you

97
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:28,815
to sound so high and
mighty, but you and your kind

98
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:32,719
are also to blame for not
advising the King honestly

99
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,323
about the spread of heresy and
abuse throughout his kingdom.

100
00:08:37,324 --> 00:08:41,478
For what are Cromwell
and Cranmer but heretics

101
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,129
and manifest abusers
of this commonwealth?

102
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,634
Lord Darcy, as I told you

103
00:08:47,635 --> 00:08:49,836
we mean no displeasure to any person.

104
00:08:49,837 --> 00:08:52,388
We ask for shelter and free passage.

105
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:55,592
All our pilgrims have taken an oath

106
00:08:55,593 --> 00:09:02,849
not to slay or murder out
of envy, but to put away fear

107
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,903
for the commonwealth and
march with the cross of Christ

108
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:10,106
and their heart's faith before them.

109
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:17,664
But we will fight and die
if you seek to stop us.

110
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,922
I am putting you in charge
of the defenses here the city.

111
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:30,276
We shall need to organize new
levies. Send word to every lords

112
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:32,929
and gentlemen to be ready with
his power. Take all the weapons,

113
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,281
harness and ordnance
you need from the Tower.

114
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:38,384
Buy more if you need to from
the merchants in the city.

115
00:09:38,385 --> 00:09:41,304
Then it's true. We are in trouble.

116
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,392
Mr. Cromwell, His Majesty
will receive you now.

117
00:10:00,307 --> 00:10:04,310
I've just received a
letter from Lord Darcy.

118
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:06,963
He says that he is in
great danger from the rebels

119
00:10:06,964 --> 00:10:10,817
and cannot maintain his resistance.

120
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:14,170
And yet he holds a
castle. A great stronghold.

121
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:18,074
Does he not mean to stand
firm against these traitors?

122
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,727
Your Majesty, I've just been told

123
00:10:20,728 --> 00:10:24,430
that the rebels have already
entered the town of Pontefract

124
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:26,232
with overwhelming numbers.

125
00:10:29,236 --> 00:10:30,737
Mr. Cromwell...

126
00:10:35,192 --> 00:10:38,745
Pontefract is the gateway to the South.

127
00:10:38,746 --> 00:10:41,364
It has great strategic importance.

128
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,953
You will write a letter
to Lord Darcy at once.

129
00:10:46,954 --> 00:10:50,506
You will tell him that I expect him

130
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:52,609
to hold that castle at all costs!

131
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

132
00:10:54,261 --> 00:10:57,213
And what of the royal army?

133
00:10:57,214 --> 00:10:59,015
What are they doing to
crush this rebellion?

134
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:01,467
Where is his Grace the Duke of Suffolk?

135
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:05,271
And that bastard
Shrewsbury! I told him too!

136
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,977
What in God's name are these men doing?

137
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:33,399
Lord Darcy.

138
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,052
My Lord!

139
00:11:38,255 --> 00:11:39,806
Darcy and York have betrayed me?

140
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:42,809
Well, we shall see
what end they come to!

141
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,811
And why haven't Shrewsbury
and Suffolk attacked yet?

142
00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:49,515
All I hear are their
complaints and their excuses!

143
00:11:49,516 --> 00:11:51,684
You know what I think?

144
00:11:51,685 --> 00:11:54,570
I think they have become
afraid of their own shadows!

145
00:11:54,571 --> 00:11:57,490
I have a mind to go North myself.

146
00:11:57,491 --> 00:12:01,678
I'll lead the army! I'll
teach these bastard ingrates

147
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,332
and rebels a fearful
bloody lesson in slaughter!

148
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,294
I wish Your Majesty would
not consider doing so.

149
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:21,097
Why? Do you suppose I'm too feeble?

150
00:12:21,098 --> 00:12:23,800
I meant that Your Majesty's
life is far too precious

151
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:26,803
to be put at risk against
such a common rabble.

152
00:12:26,804 --> 00:12:29,706
Of course if you chose to go, you
would be like a lion among wolves.

153
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:33,476
Sir Francis, I don't
require you to flatter me.

154
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:35,111
No, Your Majesty.

155
00:12:35,112 --> 00:12:38,464
Send a plain message to Suffolk.

156
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:41,467
Ask him why he refuses
to obey my commands

157
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:43,319
and ask him if he is a coward.

158
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,972
- Majesty.
- And Mr. Cromwell!

159
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:49,125
If things go badly, I know
well enough who to blame.

160
00:12:57,484 --> 00:12:59,886
Can I get Your Majesty
anything for your pain?

161
00:12:59,887 --> 00:13:05,241
Yes, I believe you can.

162
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,534
- Your Grace, the Earl
of Shrewsbury is here.

163
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,174
- My Lord.
- Your Grace.

164
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,276
Men dismissed.

165
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,928
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

166
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:52,188
We meet at a desperate moment, my Lord.

167
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:54,190
Not only are the rebel forces

168
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:56,392
overwhelmingly strong against us,

169
00:13:56,393 --> 00:13:59,645
but those men I do have I cannot
altogether trust. Many of them

170
00:13:59,646 --> 00:14:02,198
I swear think the rebels'
quarrels to be good and godly.

171
00:14:05,202 --> 00:14:10,556
Still, the King has urged us
to attack as soon as possible.

172
00:14:10,557 --> 00:14:13,209
His Majesty would not do
so if he saw our plight

173
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,211
with his own eyes. I
have almost no horsemen,

174
00:14:15,212 --> 00:14:18,314
and those I do have are
rather the flower of the North.

175
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,716
It is not possible your lordship

176
00:14:20,717 --> 00:14:22,568
to give battle knowing
defeat to be a certainty.

177
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:25,571
- Do you have some other plan?
- I intend to parley with them.

178
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:27,223
- Parley?
- My Lord,

179
00:14:27,224 --> 00:14:31,577
it's our first duty to stop
them escaping and marching South.

180
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:34,180
If they are talking
they are not marching.

181
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:37,583
Then you must tell the King.

182
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,094
Shrewsbury's forces are here...

183
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,946
Suffolk's here, not far from Newark.

184
00:14:49,947 --> 00:14:52,498
It seems likely that they
had originally planned

185
00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:55,201
to hold a line here,
along the River Trent,

186
00:14:55,202 --> 00:14:57,703
to block our advance southwards.

187
00:14:57,704 --> 00:14:59,956
How strong are they?

188
00:14:59,957 --> 00:15:04,260
- We think that Shrewsbury's men
are 6000; Suffolk's a lot less.

189
00:15:04,261 --> 00:15:07,263
They also lack horse and cannon.

190
00:15:07,264 --> 00:15:11,617
- And how many are we?
- By my reckoning,

191
00:15:11,618 --> 00:15:16,472
- somewhere over thirty thousand.
- Thirty Thousand?

192
00:15:16,473 --> 00:15:24,380
We have kept large forces here
at Doncaster, at Jervaux Abbey

193
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,032
and we are presently laying siege

194
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:29,385
to the Earl of Cumberland's
castle at Skipton.

195
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,637
North of the River Don

196
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:34,290
we have almost complete
control of the country.

197
00:15:38,295 --> 00:15:40,997
Let them come on to us!

198
00:15:40,998 --> 00:15:45,668
With God on our side, Mr.
Aske, we shall prevail.

199
00:15:51,558 --> 00:15:53,409
Poor you, Your Majesty.

200
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,312
Pour the ointment over it.

201
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:03,936
I smell sorrel and... linseed?

202
00:16:03,937 --> 00:16:08,824
Meadowplant, crushed pearls,
herb of grace, other things.

203
00:16:08,825 --> 00:16:11,527
I concocted it myself. I
don't trust my physicians.

204
00:16:11,528 --> 00:16:14,280
Hold still!

205
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:16,332
You're very brave, Lady Misseldon.

206
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:20,203
Braver, I think, than my Captains.

207
00:16:20,204 --> 00:16:23,706
And much more beautiful.

208
00:16:27,594 --> 00:16:33,716
There, it's done. I trust Your
Majesty is more comfortable.

209
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:43,726
Does Your Majesty wish me to stay?

210
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:05,881
It seems we were wrong to
suppose that the King of England

211
00:17:05,882 --> 00:17:10,236
would realize his mistakes
and the dangers to his soul.

212
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:13,089
Instead he continues
to encourage Cromwel

213
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:16,993
to vandalize and defile
the houses of God and steal

214
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:21,647
their treasures, all for
his own use and pleasure.

215
00:17:21,648 --> 00:17:26,402
And yet, even in the
darkness there is a light.

216
00:17:26,403 --> 00:17:31,274
I mean, this great
uprising of the faithful.

217
00:17:31,275 --> 00:17:36,112
This Pilgrimage of Grace.
- I have heard of it too.

218
00:17:36,113 --> 00:17:39,265
The pilgrims who marched
beneath the banner of Christ.

219
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:43,269
The Holy Father asks you to
write a pamphlet in English

220
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,623
denouncing the King and
his advisors as heretics.

221
00:17:47,624 --> 00:17:50,776
Of course. I will start
work on it straight away.

222
00:17:50,777 --> 00:17:53,129
No, No. Wait, wait.

223
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,033
His Holiness needs more from
you than just your signature.

224
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:01,037
With my encouragement, he
has decided to appoint you

225
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,689
an official legate.

226
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,293
You will travel to France and
to the Low Countries and meet

227
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,296
representatives of the
King and the Emperor.

228
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,449
- Eminence...?
- You will persuade them

229
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:17,803
to provide monies, arms and mercenaries

230
00:18:17,804 --> 00:18:22,408
to support this most
Holy Crusade in England.

231
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:26,962
If that is what His Holiness
asks me to do, then of course

232
00:18:26,963 --> 00:18:31,917
I will do it, like an
obedient son to a father.

233
00:18:31,918 --> 00:18:34,820
His Holiness has agreed

234
00:18:34,821 --> 00:18:37,473
to make you a Cardinal.

235
00:18:39,176 --> 00:18:43,329
And here is your biretta.
- I cannot accept.

236
00:18:44,981 --> 00:18:49,585
- Why not?
- I'm not worthy.

237
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,238
In other words, you
prefer your own judgment

238
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:54,940
to that of the Pope, your Holy Father.

239
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:57,943
No doubt you suppose that
makes you seem humble.

240
00:18:57,944 --> 00:19:03,849
But actually it is the
sin of pride for the Pope.

241
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:15,628
His Grace informs Your Majesty
he has no choice in the matter

242
00:19:15,629 --> 00:19:20,266
but to treat with them...
- In so doing, he hopes to bring

243
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:22,368
the nobles and the gentry to treachery

244
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,019
and for their own sakes
and their own interests

245
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,372
they will disown the
commons, if promised a pardon

246
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,974
as in fact happened in Lincolnshire.

247
00:19:28,975 --> 00:19:32,128
They are not all to be pardoned.

248
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,781
Not the leaders. Never the leaders.

249
00:19:35,782 --> 00:19:38,134
But what terms does
my Lord Suffolk intend

250
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,386
to offer the commons
to make them go home?

251
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:47,042
Huh... His Grace does not
go into details, but...

252
00:19:47,043 --> 00:19:50,045
to allay Your Majesty's fears,
he writes, in his own hand:

253
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:53,048
"I beseech Your Majesty to take
in good part whatever promises

254
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:55,401
"I shall make to these rebels,

255
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:59,405
for surely I shall
never keep any of them."

256
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:34,840
Alas, you unhappy men.

257
00:20:34,841 --> 00:20:38,544
What fancy, what folly
has led and seduced you

258
00:20:38,545 --> 00:20:42,097
to make this most shameful
rebellion against our most noble

259
00:20:42,098 --> 00:20:44,967
and righteous king and sovereign?

260
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:56,979
Are you not ashamed?

261
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,565
How can you do this,

262
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:04,119
not only giving offence to
your natural sovereign Lord

263
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,372
but giving us occasion
to fight with you,

264
00:21:06,373 --> 00:21:08,374
that have loved you more than
any other part of the realm,

265
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,827
and have always taken
you for our best friends?

266
00:21:11,828 --> 00:21:16,982
Your Grace, we mean no
offence to His Majesty.

267
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:22,738
But we have a petition which we
desire humbly to submit to him,

268
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:26,742
for the restoration of many things

269
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,495
which have gone amiss in this realm.

270
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,147
We demand the restoration of our abbeys

271
00:21:32,148 --> 00:21:36,151
and our ancient rights.
- And a new Parliament

272
00:21:36,152 --> 00:21:39,405
be summoned to address the
people's sincere grievances.

273
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:48,764
I can decide nothing here.

274
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:53,969
But I propose a truce, during
which time two of your captains

275
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,623
can take your petition and
present it to His Majesty.

276
00:21:57,624 --> 00:22:01,877
The truce to be maintained
until they return.

277
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:09,685
My Lord Darcy, can we talk a moment?

278
00:22:26,653 --> 00:22:29,955
My Lord Darcy, you more
than anyone here has cause

279
00:22:29,956 --> 00:22:32,057
to be grateful to the
King for his bounty,

280
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:34,710
for the trust he reposes in you

281
00:22:34,711 --> 00:22:39,565
and would like to repose in you still.

282
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,217
And yet here I find you

283
00:22:42,218 --> 00:22:45,321
consorting with rebels and traitors.

284
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:49,975
For my part I have been and
always will be true to the King

285
00:22:49,976 --> 00:22:54,530
our sovereign Lord, as I
was to his father before him.

286
00:22:54,531 --> 00:22:58,400
If you are as true and loyal as you say,

287
00:22:58,401 --> 00:23:01,687
then you can prove it
to us by giving over

288
00:23:01,688 --> 00:23:04,239
your Captain Mr. Aske into our hands.

289
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,243
Sir, that I cannot and will
not do. For a man who promises

290
00:23:08,244 --> 00:23:11,947
to be true to someone then
betrays him may truly be called

291
00:23:11,948 --> 00:23:14,750
a traitor.

292
00:23:17,003 --> 00:23:19,872
His Majesty, the King!

293
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:24,259
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

294
00:23:31,885 --> 00:23:33,719
Madam.

295
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,372
Your Majesty.

296
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,441
It makes me happy to
see you so much improved.

297
00:23:39,442 --> 00:23:41,477
I have a good physician.

298
00:23:41,478 --> 00:23:43,278
Nevertheless, I intend
we shall visit the shrine

299
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,982
of Sir Thomas Becket
and give our thanks.

300
00:23:46,983 --> 00:23:50,235
I have arranged for
something else which I hope,

301
00:23:50,236 --> 00:23:52,538
with all my heart, will
make you very happy.

302
00:23:57,794 --> 00:24:00,162
Your Majesty, the Lady Mary Tudor.

303
00:24:13,977 --> 00:24:17,429
I ask Your Majesty for His blessing.

304
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,565
My own daughter.

305
00:24:21,568 --> 00:24:25,571
May I present you to
Her Majesty Queen Jane?

306
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,926
I remember, some of you were desirous

307
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,695
that I should put this jewel to death!

308
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,839
I've got you, your safe.

309
00:24:45,842 --> 00:24:47,843
Be of good cheer, Mary.

310
00:24:47,844 --> 00:24:51,196
For I swear nothing
now will go against you.

311
00:24:59,973 --> 00:25:01,890
Continue!

312
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,312
- Are you happy?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

313
00:25:07,313 --> 00:25:10,866
His Majesty has agreed to give
you lodgings at Hampton Court

314
00:25:10,867 --> 00:25:12,868
and others at Greenwich Palace.

315
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:16,221
I've seen them both; they're beautiful.

316
00:25:16,222 --> 00:25:21,126
I am very grateful to
His Majesty and to you.

317
00:25:23,129 --> 00:25:25,481
Everyone says my daughter is
innocent, that she doesn't know

318
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:29,134
any unclean or foul speech.

319
00:25:29,135 --> 00:25:31,553
Do you believe that? Do you believe

320
00:25:31,554 --> 00:25:34,139
that anybody could be that innocent?

321
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,443
Go and find out.

322
00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:48,821
Lady Mary.

323
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:54,827
I wanted to apologize for my behavior.

324
00:25:54,828 --> 00:25:56,829
I hope you can find it in
your heart to forgive me.

325
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,947
I will try, Sir Francis.

326
00:25:58,948 --> 00:26:02,117
Jesus asks us to forgive everyone.

327
00:26:02,118 --> 00:26:05,471
- Do you like games, Lady Mary?
- Yes.

328
00:26:05,472 --> 00:26:07,673
There is a new game at
court that you might enjoy.

329
00:26:07,674 --> 00:26:09,274
What is it?

330
00:26:09,275 --> 00:26:13,128
It's called cunnilingus.
It's an old country practice.

331
00:26:13,129 --> 00:26:15,430
How do you play it?

332
00:26:15,431 --> 00:26:17,633
Well you...

333
00:26:17,634 --> 00:26:18,634
You...

334
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:25,140
I think you're making
fun of me, Sir Francis.

335
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:43,759
No! No le me tangere...
you can't touch me.

336
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,829
For Caesar's I am.

337
00:27:01,344 --> 00:27:05,581
Your Majesty, Sir Ralph
Ellerker and Mr. John Constable.

338
00:27:44,821 --> 00:27:46,872
Gentlemen, I ask you this:

339
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:50,392
what King has kept his subjects
so long in wealth and peace?

340
00:27:50,393 --> 00:27:54,279
So ministered justice
equally to high and low,

341
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,283
and protected you from
all outward enemies?

342
00:28:00,286 --> 00:28:03,288
I have read your submission.

343
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:05,657
Your first pretence is that
you seek to maintain the faith.

344
00:28:05,658 --> 00:28:07,993
But I tell you now gentlemen,

345
00:28:07,994 --> 00:28:10,245
that nothing is more
contrary to God's commandment

346
00:28:10,246 --> 00:28:14,800
than rebellion. Rising like
madmen against your prince,

347
00:28:14,801 --> 00:28:19,154
leaving lands untilled and
corn unsown is not the behavior

348
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:22,658
of the proper commonwealth you claim to be!
- Your Majesty I feel compelled.

349
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,761
Hush! You are before the King's Majesty.

350
00:28:25,762 --> 00:28:29,665
You make false claims about our
intentions towards the church.

351
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,317
We have done nothing but
what the clergy in York

352
00:28:32,318 --> 00:28:35,320
and Canterbury agreed was in
accordance with God's holy word.

353
00:28:35,321 --> 00:28:38,056
God's holy word, gentlemen!

354
00:28:39,742 --> 00:28:43,195
So how can the simple
people say the contrary?

355
00:28:43,196 --> 00:28:46,098
What presumption and madness
is it of them to claim

356
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,201
the knowledge of God's
law when they are ignorant

357
00:28:49,202 --> 00:28:52,754
and less knowledgeable and
should rather know their duty?

358
00:29:05,969 --> 00:29:07,869
You have seen before, in
Lincolnshire and elsewhere,

359
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,638
how temperate and forgiving
is our inclination.

360
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:12,891
Though rebellion is against God's will,

361
00:29:12,892 --> 00:29:15,127
I declare my intention through the pity

362
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,230
and compassion of our
princely heart to pardon

363
00:29:18,231 --> 00:29:21,450
all of you who have transgressed,

364
00:29:21,451 --> 00:29:24,036
on condition that you
now lay down your arms.

365
00:29:24,037 --> 00:29:26,238
His Grace the Duke of Suffolk

366
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:29,541
will come North again to Yorkshire
to moderate with you and make peace

367
00:29:29,542 --> 00:29:31,960
and see you disbanded.

368
00:29:31,961 --> 00:29:35,163
Good day, gentlemen.

369
00:29:56,686 --> 00:30:00,572
Your Grace?

370
00:30:00,573 --> 00:30:03,575
Your Grace should know
our army of pilgrims

371
00:30:03,576 --> 00:30:09,131
will not disperse just for
the promise of a pardon.

372
00:30:09,132 --> 00:30:13,535
Our pilgrimage is not over.
- I do know.

373
00:30:13,536 --> 00:30:17,089
And I have told the King.
That is why he has given me

374
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,208
permission to negotiate with
you further in good faith.

375
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:24,946
- On the basis of our petition?
- Yes.

376
00:30:24,947 --> 00:30:27,949
Does Your Grace have some
token of this "good faith"?

377
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,951
You don't trust my word?

378
00:30:29,952 --> 00:30:34,856
Not for me, for our Captain
Mr. Aske. He's a lawyer.

379
00:30:34,857 --> 00:30:37,209
Here is a promise.

380
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,211
in his Majesty's own hand,

381
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,113
to deal with you openly,
fairly and reasonably,

382
00:30:41,114 --> 00:30:43,732
as his loving subjects.

383
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:53,375
We are grateful and
bounden to His Majesty.

384
00:30:53,376 --> 00:30:56,378
Good night, gentlemen.

385
00:31:03,636 --> 00:31:05,987
This is for the Lancashire Herald.

386
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:08,640
See that it is dispatched immediately.

387
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:48,430
Mr. Constable... I beg
you, do not put your trust

388
00:31:48,431 --> 00:31:50,932
in Mr. Cromwell.

389
00:31:56,355 --> 00:32:00,358
I thank God and Your Majesty
for your great mercy today.

390
00:32:02,445 --> 00:32:04,796
I think you are the kindest of rulers,

391
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:08,800
and I wish with all my
heart the world knew it.

392
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,819
The world chooses what
it wants to know, Jane.

393
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,705
But you can change its mind!

394
00:32:13,706 --> 00:32:16,057
I beg you to restore

395
00:32:16,058 --> 00:32:18,410
- and keep the abbeys.
- Jane...

396
00:32:18,411 --> 00:32:20,412
Think what the world will think.

397
00:32:20,413 --> 00:32:23,665
That you listened to your
people and to your heart.

398
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:26,568
- Jane...
- I've told you once before:

399
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,221
don't to meddle with my affairs.

400
00:32:33,226 --> 00:32:35,844
Do you remember what
happened to the late Queen?

401
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,981
Yes...

402
00:32:39,982 --> 00:32:43,335
- I love you more than her.

403
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,338
More even than Catherine.

404
00:32:49,992 --> 00:32:51,993
Don't spoil it.

405
00:33:11,764 --> 00:33:14,382
Cardinal Pole.

406
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:19,020
My name is Diego Hurtado de Mendoza

407
00:33:19,021 --> 00:33:21,022
and these gentlemen are all advisers

408
00:33:21,023 --> 00:33:23,725
to His Imperial Majesty, King Charles V.

409
00:33:23,726 --> 00:33:27,028
Sirs, I carry this letter

410
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:29,147
of legatine authority from
his Holiness Pope Paul.

411
00:33:29,148 --> 00:33:32,901
Shall we be seated?

412
00:33:39,292 --> 00:33:42,644
We were aware, Eminence, that
you were on your way here.

413
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,646
But, forgive me, we remain

414
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,649
a little unsure as to the
exact nature of your mission.

415
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,301
I am sure you are aware

416
00:33:49,302 --> 00:33:52,304
of the risings which have
taken place across England

417
00:33:52,305 --> 00:33:55,657
against the King, that heretic
Cromwell and all his sect.

418
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,309
We have heard

419
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:01,680
some information, certainly.
And naturally we are intrigued.

420
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:07,569
These popular risings
are the greatest chance

421
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,322
that we may ever have to restore
the true religion to England,

422
00:34:10,323 --> 00:34:15,377
but the faithful people
of my country need support.

423
00:34:15,378 --> 00:34:23,084
Each of us, senor Mendoza,
in our own way must encourage

424
00:34:23,085 --> 00:34:26,037
the risings to continue
and to grow in strength.

425
00:34:30,793 --> 00:34:34,212
Even if that means the
overthrow of the King himself,

426
00:34:34,213 --> 00:34:37,515
not just his wicked council?

427
00:34:37,516 --> 00:34:38,717
Yes.

428
00:34:41,053 --> 00:34:44,606
We can imagine such
an outcome without fear

429
00:34:44,607 --> 00:34:47,609
for there is another,
close to the throne,

430
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,961
with a legitimate
claim and a true faith:

431
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:52,364
the Lady Mary.

432
00:34:54,617 --> 00:34:57,986
If not her,

433
00:34:57,987 --> 00:35:01,222
there is still another Catholic
with a legitimate claim.

434
00:35:01,223 --> 00:35:04,292
A scion of the Plantagenets,

435
00:35:04,293 --> 00:35:06,378
who ruled before the Tudors,
and would gladly rule after them.

436
00:35:06,379 --> 00:35:10,749
Of whom do you speak, Your Eminence?

437
00:35:13,636 --> 00:35:16,988
I speak of myself, senor Mendoza.

438
00:35:24,647 --> 00:35:26,181
Ralph...

439
00:35:26,182 --> 00:35:29,317
John! We have waited and
prayed for your safe return.

440
00:35:29,318 --> 00:35:33,071
Thank God! Thank God!
- The King in his mercy

441
00:35:33,072 --> 00:35:36,775
has offered us a general
pardon! He is also sending

442
00:35:36,776 --> 00:35:38,360
the Duke of Suffolk to
negotiate and treat with us,

443
00:35:38,361 --> 00:35:41,663
without preconditions and
on the basis of our demands.

444
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:48,770
- Is it true?
- I trust the King's good faith

445
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,422
and mercy and here's the proof of it.

446
00:35:50,423 --> 00:35:53,091
We are to meet again here.

447
00:35:59,882 --> 00:36:02,183
You have not said anything yet, John.

448
00:36:02,184 --> 00:36:05,537
Is it because you do
not agree with Sir Ralph?

449
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:08,056
No, I cannot agree with him.

450
00:36:08,057 --> 00:36:10,692
How should I agree when I think

451
00:36:10,693 --> 00:36:12,694
that devil Cromwell has
such a hold over the King

452
00:36:12,695 --> 00:36:16,197
that I account these promises
to be utterly worthless!

453
00:36:16,198 --> 00:36:18,800
You don't think we
should meet with them?

454
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,902
No, I don't. We should
expose their lies.

455
00:36:20,903 --> 00:36:24,806
Call a general muster,
take over all of the North

456
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,575
and only then condescend to a meeting.

457
00:36:27,576 --> 00:36:31,413
Why are you so sure that their
word is not to be trusted?

458
00:36:31,414 --> 00:36:35,166
- Because of this.
- What's that?

459
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:37,719
A copy of a letter from Cromwell

460
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,838
to the Yorkshire gentry.

461
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,841
I'll read some of it to you.

462
00:36:42,842 --> 00:36:46,094
"There is hope they
may disperse peacefully,

463
00:36:46,095 --> 00:36:50,598
"but if these rebels continue
with their illegal assemblies

464
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:54,486
"and their defiance then
their rebellion will be crushed

465
00:36:54,487 --> 00:36:58,990
"so forcibly that their example
shall be fearful to all subjects

466
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:02,861
so long as the world does endure."

467
00:37:05,698 --> 00:37:09,417
"So long as the world
does endure", gentlemen.

468
00:37:11,871 --> 00:37:15,106
But the truth is they cannot crush us.

469
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,459
And that is why the Duke
is forced to negotiate.

470
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:21,262
This sure sign of their deviousness
does not impress you then?

471
00:37:25,684 --> 00:37:28,620
I say we do not stop our vigilance.

472
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:32,273
But prepare for our meeting,
clarify our positions

473
00:37:32,274 --> 00:37:35,276
and strengthen our arguments and have

474
00:37:35,277 --> 00:37:37,195
our Church leaders endorse them.

475
00:37:41,984 --> 00:37:46,237
Why should we fear, John,
when we are about God's work?

476
00:37:46,238 --> 00:37:48,790
I know we are but...

477
00:37:53,796 --> 00:37:58,500
I only hope that none of
us - nor our grandchildren -

478
00:37:58,501 --> 00:38:01,653
ever live to regret this moment.

479
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:04,656
I wanted to wish you every
success for your journey

480
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:09,310
and conference with the rebels.
- I am grateful to Your Majesty.

481
00:38:09,311 --> 00:38:12,664
You know I desire more than
anything else a peaceful remedy.

482
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,016
You have my permission to
prolong the truce for as long

483
00:38:15,017 --> 00:38:18,319
as necessary. You may also
affirm my general pardon

484
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,172
to all the rebels. Except their leaders.

485
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:23,691
I want them brought to you still,

486
00:38:23,692 --> 00:38:26,277
with halters around their necks!

487
00:38:31,584 --> 00:38:37,205
Your Majesty knows the rebels,
no doubt unjustly, blame

488
00:38:37,206 --> 00:38:39,891
Master Cromwell for
many of their actions.

489
00:38:39,892 --> 00:38:43,711
Repeatedly they ask for
his removal and punishment.

490
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,964
What should I tell them?

491
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,814
You know what this is, Charles?

492
00:39:02,815 --> 00:39:07,619
Fruit from the New
World. New things come in.

493
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:14,325
Everything changes. I have
a great appetite for novelty.

494
00:39:14,326 --> 00:39:17,378
Tell them what you like.

495
00:39:32,394 --> 00:39:35,496
Gentlemen, I have
read your new petition.

496
00:39:35,497 --> 00:39:37,849
Among other articles,
you ask for the setting up

497
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:40,268
of a special convocation or Parliament

498
00:39:40,269 --> 00:39:42,503
to debate without fear

499
00:39:42,504 --> 00:39:45,773
or his Majesty's displeasure
questions of heresy,

500
00:39:45,774 --> 00:39:49,861
the royal supremacy, and
maintenance of the faith.

501
00:39:49,862 --> 00:39:53,765
I can tell you now that the King has
graciously conceded to your request.

502
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:57,518
A special parliament

503
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:02,290
will be summoned to be held
not far away at Westminster

504
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:07,178
but here in York, to debate and
decide on all these questions.

505
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:14,786
Thank you. We have asked for the
heresies of Luther, Wycliffe and Tyndale

506
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,138
to be annulled and destroyed.

507
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:20,692
We have asked that the heretics,

508
00:40:20,693 --> 00:40:22,894
bishops and temporal, be punished.

509
00:40:22,895 --> 00:40:26,564
That Cromwell, Audley, Sir Richard Rich

510
00:40:26,565 --> 00:40:30,702
be punished as subverters of
the good laws of this realm

511
00:40:30,703 --> 00:40:33,571
and maintainers of false sects.

512
00:40:33,572 --> 00:40:37,158
That is not for me to decide

513
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:41,813
whatever my true feelings.
But such questions are exactly

514
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:45,466
what the special Parliament
will be constituted to decide.

515
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:48,219
Is it possible that this
Parliament can also debate

516
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,222
the question of papal obedience,
touching the cure of souls,

517
00:40:51,223 --> 00:40:53,224
and the legitimacy of the Lady Mary?

518
00:40:53,225 --> 00:40:54,976
Yes, Mr. Aske.

519
00:40:54,977 --> 00:40:57,328
I can guarantee that all
these great matters can be put

520
00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:00,932
before the Parliament
without fear or favor.

521
00:41:00,933 --> 00:41:03,484
And the King is still willing
to offer a general pardon?

522
00:41:03,485 --> 00:41:07,839
Yes. I say that with hesitation.

523
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,492
The more His Majesty understands
the causes of this uprising,

524
00:41:11,493 --> 00:41:14,946
and the loyalty of the
pilgrims to his person and rule,

525
00:41:14,947 --> 00:41:17,498
the more is he persuaded
to show clemency.

526
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:23,504
- There is one other great
matter. Your Grace knows

527
00:41:23,505 --> 00:41:29,110
that we demand that the suppressed
abbeys should stand or be restored.

528
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:31,379
This is our sticking point.

529
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,615
We were always determined
to fight and die

530
00:41:34,616 --> 00:41:37,468
for the maintenance of
our religious houses.

531
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:39,370
What I can say about that is that

532
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,639
all further destruction
of the abbeys will cease

533
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,125
until Parliament meets.

534
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,378
It will then be up to
Parliament to decide if and when

535
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:50,531
the others will be restored.

536
00:41:50,532 --> 00:41:55,536
Go home and put aside your arms.

537
00:41:55,537 --> 00:42:00,541
By standing together
and by standing strong,

538
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:04,545
I believe we have achieved as
much as we could have gained

539
00:42:04,546 --> 00:42:08,399
when we first took up this
great pilgrimage of ours.

540
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,304
It is almost Christmas. Go
home and celebrate the birth

541
00:42:13,305 --> 00:42:15,907
of our Lord Jesus Christ

542
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:20,928
We thank God as we
thank the King's Majesty

543
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:24,932
that all this has been
achieved without bloodshed.

544
00:42:24,933 --> 00:42:29,821
Please listen to the King's herald.

545
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:39,080
"His Gracious Majesty King Henry VIII

546
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:43,000
"hereby pardons by royal
command all those subjects

547
00:42:43,001 --> 00:42:48,589
who have transgressed and
risen in unlawful rebellion."

548
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:51,192
I therefore ask everyone of you

549
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:57,098
to disperse, go home
and put aside your arms.

550
00:42:57,099 --> 00:43:02,453
Firm in the knowledge that
our faith is to be maintained

551
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:05,389
and not destroyed!

552
00:43:19,571 --> 00:43:21,622
- What is it, husband?
- I believe it's from the King.

553
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,001
What does it say?

554
00:43:34,002 --> 00:43:35,887
Father?!

555
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:42,643
"My trusty and well-beloved
Aske. I am informed that,

556
00:43:42,644 --> 00:43:45,513
"notwithstanding your
offences committed against us

557
00:43:45,514 --> 00:43:47,748
"in the late rebellion
attempted in those parts,

558
00:43:47,749 --> 00:43:50,101
"you are now at heart repentant.

559
00:43:50,102 --> 00:43:53,004
"And since you are determined
to be a faithful subject,

560
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:57,358
we have conceived a great
desire to speak with you..."

561
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:02,213
- Father!
- Hush, children, hush! Listen to your father..

562
00:44:02,214 --> 00:44:06,167
"... and to hear from your mouth the whole
circumstance and beginning of that matter."

563
00:44:06,168 --> 00:44:08,419
The King wants to speak
with me. Can you believe it?

564
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,006
"I therefore order you, as
our true and faithful subject,

565
00:44:12,007 --> 00:44:15,977
"as we now repute you, to come
to court for Christmastide.

566
00:44:15,978 --> 00:44:18,546
"You are not to let anyone know,
but you will use such plainness

567
00:44:18,547 --> 00:44:21,799
"and frankness in all things
we shall demand of you,

568
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,552
that we may have cause to
reward you even further."

569
00:44:24,553 --> 00:44:27,889
There is a credence attached saying

570
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:30,858
that "You shall safe come
and safe go from court,

571
00:44:30,859 --> 00:44:33,361
returning before the
twelfth day of Christmas."

572
00:44:33,362 --> 00:44:38,566
Just make sure that he
means to honor the promises

573
00:44:38,567 --> 00:44:40,151
Lord Suffolk made on
his behalf at Doncaster.

574
00:44:40,152 --> 00:44:42,153
Is it not obvious that the
King has taken this matter

575
00:44:42,154 --> 00:44:43,955
to his heart? This is a
letter written in his own hand.

576
00:44:43,956 --> 00:44:46,574
- You are still too trusting.
- I would not go now.

577
00:44:46,575 --> 00:44:49,810
But there is a promise of safe return.

578
00:44:49,811 --> 00:44:53,464
- Promises can be broken.
- Mr. Constable, the promises

579
00:44:53,465 --> 00:44:56,167
of a King are worth a great
deal more than the promises

580
00:44:56,168 --> 00:44:58,819
- of ordinary folk.
- Here's what we shall do:

581
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:02,473
I will arrange to lay post
horses all the way between here

582
00:45:02,474 --> 00:45:06,477
and London, so that if
God forbid, Mr. Aske,

583
00:45:06,478 --> 00:45:10,932
you were imprisoned or
otherwise badly treated,

584
00:45:10,933 --> 00:45:13,834
I will hear about it straight away,

585
00:45:13,835 --> 00:45:15,486
and raise the people
again for your deliverance.

586
00:45:15,487 --> 00:45:20,241
Thank you Lord, that's it.
