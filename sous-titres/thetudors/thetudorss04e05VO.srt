Allow me to introduce my wife,
Queen Katherine.

<i>It seems incredible to have obtained
such a perfect jewel of womanhood</i>

4
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:09,801
<i>who bears towards me
such perfect love.</i>

5
00:00:10,164 --> 00:00:12,095
<i>I urge Your Majesty to be careful.</i>

6
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,531
<i>What, Lady Rochford?</i>

7
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,154
Don't you think I know
how to meddle with a man?

8
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:18,396
You hate my brother.

9
00:00:18,563 --> 00:00:20,808
If only you could be
more like him, Sir Thomas.

10
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:23,321
My husband always takes
what he wants.

11
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:25,934
It is him, isn't it?

12
00:00:27,077 --> 00:00:29,779
Surely you can understand
why I cannot offer you anything.

13
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,570
- But you employed Joan Bulmer.
- I can't!

14
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,936
But you can, Your Majesty.

15
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,954
Her name is Katherine Howard,
and I've known her a long time.

16
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,789
We used to be very close.

17
00:00:40,232 --> 00:00:41,563
Very close.

18
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:44,628
Today I appointed a new usher
to my chambers.

19
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,536
- You don't mind?
- Of course not.

20
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:48,172
You must do as you will.

21
00:00:48,498 --> 00:00:49,966
Madam, your good health.

22
00:00:51,877 --> 00:00:52,969
I must see him.

23
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:54,387
Who, Your Majesty?

24
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,208
- Culpepper.
- My lady.

25
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,491
Tell him to come when
the King is asleep.

26
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:01,019
This Dereham,
you have to get rid of him.

27
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,687
I will, I promise.

28
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,519
<i>I told you, I love you.</i>

29
00:01:04,935 --> 00:01:08,109
You must not be so familiar
with the Queen of England.

30
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,197
The King ought to know how beggarly
his wife's servants treat her.

31
00:01:11,364 --> 00:01:13,782
Damn you Fell! Damn you!

32
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,784
His Majesty wishes to thank God

33
00:01:16,154 --> 00:01:19,621
for blessing him with so perfect
a companion as Queen Katherine.

34
00:01:20,096 --> 00:01:22,290
I render thanks to Thee, oh Lord.

35
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,099
You hast been pleased
to give me a wife

36
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,003

00:02:51,702 --> 00:02:54,740
- What does this letter say?
- I thought Your Majesty just read...

43
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:57,594
I asked you to tell me
what this letter says, My Lord Hertford.

44
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,315
The letter accuses Queen
Katherine of dissolute living

45
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,405
before she was married
to Your Majesty,

46
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:15,361
while she was living with
the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk.

47
00:03:16,788 --> 00:03:18,047
There was two men.

48
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:21,111
A music teacher named Henry Manox,

49
00:03:21,278 --> 00:03:24,459
and a gentleman
called Francis Dereham.

50
00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:27,806
And that her way of life
was not a secret,

51
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:30,101
that many knew of it.

52
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:33,040
Who wrote the letter?

53
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,380
It is not signed.

54
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:37,641
Whoever left it says he only wrote it
because he did not have the heart

55
00:03:37,808 --> 00:03:39,029
to tell you by mouth.

56
00:03:39,196 --> 00:03:41,838
- It's a forgery!
- Yes, Your Majesty.

57
00:03:42,248 --> 00:03:45,517
The accusations in this letter
are maliciously intended.

58
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,144
Many calumnies are published
about well-known persons.

59
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,104
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Nevertheless,

60
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:52,782
I charge you to investigate
the matter thoroughly.

61
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:55,801
Do not desist until you have
reached to the bottom of the pot.

62
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,874
The Queen shall be confined
to her apartments,

63
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,175
with only Lady Rochford
in attendance,

64
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:03,070
until her name is cleared.

65
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:04,872
My Lord.

66
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:07,305
Majesty.

67
00:04:16,158 --> 00:04:17,308
Your Majesty.

68
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,545
No, the other hand.

69
00:04:33,847 --> 00:04:34,649
What?

70
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,935
Sergeant? What is this?

71
00:04:42,102 --> 00:04:44,234
My Lady, you are confined
to your apartments,

72
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:46,286
with only Lady Rochford
to attend you,

73
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,455
for as long as it please the King.

74
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,714
Please, Katherine,
don't let them take me!

75
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:56,231
Joan! Joan!

76
00:04:58,841 --> 00:04:59,658
Why?

77
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,557
Why must I stay here?

78
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:04,637
Please tell me.
I don't understand.

79
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,891
Forgive me, but from now on, there will
be a guard posted beyond the door.

80
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,061
Please.

81
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:21,134
Francis Dereham,
you are under arrest.

82
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:22,901
Under arrest for what?

83
00:05:23,632 --> 00:05:25,437
For what, I ask you?

84
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:34,461
I want to ask you some questions

85
00:05:34,628 --> 00:05:37,139
about what went on
some years ago at Lambeth,

86
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,880
between Katherine Howard,
as she then was, and two men,

87
00:05:43,372 --> 00:05:44,572
Henry Manox...

88
00:05:45,818 --> 00:05:47,013
and Francis Dereham.

89
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,851
You know what I'm talking
about, don't you?

90
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,908
There's no need to be afraid,
Mistress Bulmer.

91
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:09,766
No harm will come to you,

92
00:06:11,015 --> 00:06:13,229
so long as you tell me the truth!

93
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:15,198
Is that clear?

94
00:06:17,635 --> 00:06:18,635
Yes, sir.

95
00:06:21,603 --> 00:06:25,143
I understand that this man,
Henry Manox, was a music teacher.

96
00:06:26,796 --> 00:06:27,896
Did you ever

97
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:29,518
see him or...

98
00:06:29,748 --> 00:06:32,433
hear of him taking liberties
with Katherine Howard?

99
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,493
Yes, sir.

100
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,498
He told me he was in love with her.

101
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:39,649
But I told him,

102
00:06:40,124 --> 00:06:43,240
I said if my lady knew of the love
between him and Mistress Howard,

103
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:45,188
she would undo him, because...

104
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:47,402
she is from a noble house,

105
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:50,661
and if you marry her,
some of her blood will kill you.

106
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,478
And what did Manox say?

107
00:06:53,135 --> 00:06:55,172
He said, "Hold your peace, woman!"

108
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:57,684
"My designs are
of a dishonest kind."

109
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,311
"I doubt not
I shall achieve my purpose."

110
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:06,968
She said to him
that he would have her maidenhead,

111
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:09,425
though it be painful to her,

112
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,030
knowing he'd be good
to her afterwards.

113
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:13,451
And did he...

114
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:15,651
have her maidenhead?

115
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:19,147
No, sir, for she started
seeing someone else.

116
00:07:21,762 --> 00:07:24,591
And would that man be
Francis Dereham?

117
00:07:30,022 --> 00:07:31,172
Yes, my Lord.

118
00:07:31,622 --> 00:07:33,490
Did you know Katherine Howard
at Lambeth,

119
00:07:33,657 --> 00:07:35,757
when she was 14 or 15 years old?

120
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:36,998
Yes, sir.

121
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:40,520
Did you have carnal
knowledge of her?

122
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:44,253
We...

123
00:07:45,017 --> 00:07:46,417
played some games.

124
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,596
We pretended to be man and wife.

125
00:07:49,974 --> 00:07:51,159
It amused her.

126
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:53,126
Did you know her carnally?

127
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:56,845
You should know, Mr. Dereham,

128
00:07:57,012 --> 00:08:00,188
that we have spoken to some of the maids
who used to sleep in the same dormitory.

129
00:08:02,352 --> 00:08:05,026
They say that you crept into
the Queen's bed for a hundred nights.

130
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,551
- She was not the Queen.
- Let me ask again.

131
00:08:08,929 --> 00:08:11,979
Did you have carnal knowledge
of Katherine Howard?

132
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:18,364
No!

133
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:36,265
I thought you were not altogether
honest with me, Mr. Dereham.

134
00:08:38,516 --> 00:08:41,782
I wanted to show you what we do
to people who are dishonest,

135
00:08:42,682 --> 00:08:44,432
who don't tell the truth.

136
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:48,992
I'll tell you the truth.

137
00:09:00,204 --> 00:09:02,416
Certain accusations have been
made against the Queen.

138
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:06,462
What kind of accusations?

139
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,965
That she was light,
immoral, dissolute...

140
00:09:10,712 --> 00:09:12,162
with certain men...

141
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:15,035
before she came to court.

142
00:09:21,054 --> 00:09:22,941
I can't believe it to be true.

143
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:26,874
But since the accusations are made,
I must know all the facts.

144
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:31,639
But since this inquisition
is in progress,

145
00:09:32,557 --> 00:09:34,457
be careful who you speak to.

146
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,659
I'll have no spark of scandal
against her name.

147
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,519
Yes, Your Majesty.

148
00:09:45,153 --> 00:09:46,603
I have a good hand.

149
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:53,217
What do they know?

150
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:57,639
Why have I been confined like this?

151
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:00,199
I don't know.

152
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,256
Someone has told them something!

153
00:10:07,855 --> 00:10:08,855
Who?

154
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:12,160
What has he told them?

155
00:10:13,142 --> 00:10:15,233
What has he told them?

156
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,822
Why are you crying like this?

157
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,913
It's not about you!

158
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,417
I have to speak to him.

159
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,182
I have to speak to the King.

160
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,160
He'll understand.

161
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:53,131
We have some evidence
that Katherine Howard

162
00:10:53,298 --> 00:10:56,098
gave you a gold chain
and rich cap as a gift.

163
00:10:58,762 --> 00:11:00,812
Why did she buy you such gifts?

164
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:07,083
Because she loved me.

165
00:11:07,582 --> 00:11:08,779
Loved you?

166
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:10,437
Yes, my Lord.

167
00:11:11,225 --> 00:11:14,415
She told me: "I promise you
I do love you with all my heart."

168
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,100
She promised by her faith and troth

169
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:21,261
that she would take
no other husband but me.

170
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:23,137
You were pre-contracted then?

171
00:11:23,304 --> 00:11:24,304
Yes, sir.

172
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:28,628
It was understood between us
that we would get married.

173
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:30,616
That's why...

174
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:34,110
That's why you knew her carnally?

175
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:36,843
Yes, sir.

176
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:39,224
We weren't doing anything wrong.

177
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,708
She was going to be my wife
and I her husband.

178
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:44,677
We'd made promises before God.

179
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:46,873
Why did you not marry her, then?

180
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:51,573
I left Lambeth for a while
and went to Ireland.

181
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:56,191
When I returned,
Katherine was already at court.

182
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:59,698
The Queen recently took you back
into her employment.

183
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:01,672
On what grounds?

184
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:06,246
The Dowager Duchess was kind enough
to speak highly of my talents.

185
00:12:06,765 --> 00:12:09,802
You have admitted to the fact that you
had carnal knowledge of the Queen

186
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:11,839
before her marriage to the King.

187
00:12:12,182 --> 00:12:14,479
But did you also know her
carnally afterwards?

188
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:17,040
No, sir! No! On my honour!

189
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:19,168
On your honour, Mr. Dereham?

190
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,721
My Lady?

191
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:31,901
His Excellency is here.

192
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,483
Eustace! Please, sit.

193
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:44,616
Thank you, Lady Mary.
You are too gracious.

194
00:12:48,354 --> 00:12:49,896
I had to see you.

195
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,104
There are many rumours at court.

196
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:57,445
And it seems the Queen
has been confined to her apartments.

197
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:59,455
- Why?
- Nobody knows.

198
00:13:00,097 --> 00:13:02,743
But the rumours
speak of her misconduct.

199
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,910
I knew it.

200
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:08,037
I knew she was always a light young
woman, dedicated only to pleasure.

201
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:12,413
And the sad fact is, Lady Mary, that
the Howards are a great Catholic family.

202
00:13:12,763 --> 00:13:13,763
No,

203
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:18,254
the sad fact is that Katherine Howard
was never a good Catholic,

204
00:13:18,421 --> 00:13:19,971
nor ever a good wife.

205
00:13:20,806 --> 00:13:22,692
Nor even less a Queen!

206
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,145
What have you discovered?

207
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,073
Katherine Howard was
a loose young woman.

208
00:13:29,594 --> 00:13:31,890
You surely knew that!

209
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:35,523
I was told that her upbringing
had been unconventional.

210
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,519
I didn't know how unconventional.

211
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:40,815
I didn't suspect that at 14 years old
she was sleeping with two older men!

212
00:13:41,107 --> 00:13:42,321
You met her!

213
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:46,696
You saw the look in her eyes.
She was never innocent.

214
00:13:47,268 --> 00:13:49,829
And who is innocent, my sweetheart?

215
00:13:52,752 --> 00:13:54,502
What did Dereham confess?

216
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:58,419
Only that he'd slept with the Queen
before she was married.

217
00:13:59,126 --> 00:14:00,478
Do you believe him?

218
00:14:00,645 --> 00:14:03,047
I don't know. I may ask again.

219
00:14:08,918 --> 00:14:11,183
Husband, you must be careful.

220
00:14:11,787 --> 00:14:13,945
If you remember,
you were among those

221
00:14:14,112 --> 00:14:15,855
who offered Katherine up
to the King.

222
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,305
Do you suppose I ever forget that?

223
00:14:18,844 --> 00:14:21,831
But that's why I must be harder
on her than anyone else.

224
00:14:21,998 --> 00:14:23,821
Since I was the most deceived.

225
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:27,344
I must to bed.

226
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:29,712
I have things to do in the morning.
I bid thee,

227
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:32,371
all three of thee, good night.

228
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:34,792
Good night, brother.

229
00:14:41,303 --> 00:14:42,303
So...

230
00:14:44,915 --> 00:14:47,552
What shall we call
your child, Thomas?

231
00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:02,568
Sir Edward,

232
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:07,656
can you not tell me what's happening?
I beg you, no one tells me anything.

233
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,434
Please, please.

234
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:11,477
Madam, I am forbidden
to talk to you.

235
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,454
No, no. You must speak to me.

236
00:15:13,723 --> 00:15:16,623
- Madam, I can't. On my life!
- Just something!

237
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:19,126
Why am I confined here?

238
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,220
What has anyone said?

239
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:29,420
They have taken Dereham
to the Tower.

240
00:15:30,645 --> 00:15:33,995
Also some of the maids
who attended the Dowager Duchess.

241
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:37,478
My God.

242
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,438
That's all I know.

243
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,160
Madam, you will have to excuse me.

244
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:44,727
I can say no more.

245
00:15:53,736 --> 00:15:55,458
His Majesty the King.

246
00:15:56,718 --> 00:15:57,852
Your Majesty.

247
00:16:27,935 --> 00:16:28,985
Your Grace?

248
00:16:31,678 --> 00:16:32,828
Your Majesty,

249
00:16:33,936 --> 00:16:36,120
my Lord Hertford,
and other Councillors,

250
00:16:37,365 --> 00:16:39,623
have made diligent inquiries

251
00:16:39,893 --> 00:16:41,743
into the question of the...

252
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:43,502
misconduct of the Queen.

253
00:16:45,177 --> 00:16:46,177
And?

254
00:16:46,517 --> 00:16:47,631
Your Majesty-

255
00:16:49,912 --> 00:16:53,861
I have to tell Your Majesty that even
from my preliminary investigations,

256
00:16:54,998 --> 00:16:57,641
we believe the allegations
against Queen Katherine

257
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,852
have a sound basis in fact...

258
00:17:02,172 --> 00:17:05,604
The Queen received the attentions
of her music master, Henry Manox

259
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:08,582
when she lived
with the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk.

260
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:12,823
Manox swears under oath
that she never gave him her maidenhead.

261
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,911
But that instead it was given
to a man called Francis Dereham.

262
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:23,592
There is ample proof that they spent
many nights together...

263
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:24,759
naked.

264
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:32,166
Dereham claims that he was
pre-contracted to the Queen,

265
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,387
so he did no wrong by having
carnal relations with her,

266
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,381
and that their relationship
was over when he left for Ireland

267
00:17:38,548 --> 00:17:40,601
and the Queen
for Your Majesty's court.

268
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,230
Unfortunately...

269
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,364
Queen Katherine took this same Dereham
back into her employment

270
00:17:50,531 --> 00:17:52,571
during Your Majesty's late progress,

271
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:55,491
appointing him her personal

272
00:17:56,231 --> 00:17:58,063
secretary and usher.

273
00:18:01,062 --> 00:18:04,041
I have to say that she has
betrayed you in thought,

274
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:06,675
and if she had an opportunity,

275
00:18:07,115 --> 00:18:08,712
would have betrayed you in deed.

276
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:31,318
My Lady.

277
00:18:31,954 --> 00:18:33,004
Sir Thomas?

278
00:18:35,142 --> 00:18:36,426
What is it?

279
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:37,860
Madam,

280
00:18:38,027 --> 00:18:41,211
I have come to tell you that,
for your offences against the King,

281
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:43,650
all your household
has been discharged.

282
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:46,542
Your coffers and chests will be
sealed and placed under guard,

283
00:18:47,307 --> 00:18:49,503
and I am also come here
to collect all your jewels

284
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,712
and return them to His Majesty.

285
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:53,215
Please, sir Thomas,

286
00:18:53,662 --> 00:18:54,931
where is the King?

287
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,417
I must see him.

288
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,022
Madam, I must tell you

289
00:18:58,189 --> 00:19:01,766
that the King and his Council
have ordained that, for your offences,

290
00:19:02,354 --> 00:19:03,975
you have forfeited
the title of Queen,

291
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:06,687
and must be known
as Lady Katherine Howard.

292
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:09,179
You will be taken
to Syon Abbey today,

293
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:11,268
to wait upon the King's
further pleasure.

294
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:12,866
Where is the King?

295
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,079
I need to speak to him.

296
00:19:15,752 --> 00:19:18,532
You don't understand.
I have to speak to him.

297
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:22,066
Then everything will be all right.

298
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:25,456
Don't you understand?
Everything will be all right.

299
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,231
His Majesty is at Chapel.

300
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:31,333
But I fear he will not speak to you.

301
00:19:41,132 --> 00:19:42,139
Lady Katherine!

302
00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:44,387
Stop her! Guards!

303
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:46,185
Katherine Howard! Stop her!

304
00:19:46,607 --> 00:19:48,015
Katherine Howard! Stop!

305
00:19:48,371 --> 00:19:50,007
You are arrested. Stop!

306
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:52,095
Do not proceed, Katherine Howard!

307
00:19:52,262 --> 00:19:53,658
Your Majesty!

308
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,578
I must speak to you. Please.

309
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:57,635
Please, Your Majesty!

310
00:19:57,802 --> 00:20:00,699
Please, it's me, Katherine!
It's Katherine.

311
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,416
It's Katherine. Please.

312
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,120
Please.

313
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,331
Henry! Henry, please!

314
00:20:08,328 --> 00:20:09,917
No! Your Majesty!

315
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,427
No, please!

316
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:15,631
Henry! No, please! Please, Henry!

317
00:20:22,762 --> 00:20:24,790
Risley. Risley!

318
00:20:26,886 --> 00:20:27,887
Majesty.

319
00:20:28,054 --> 00:20:29,678
Go and fetch Bishop Gardiner.

320
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:32,561
- I must speak to him.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

321
00:20:43,312 --> 00:20:44,801
Why are you doing this?

322
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,576
Why are you doing this?

323
00:20:46,743 --> 00:20:48,622
I've already told you
everything I know!

324
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:51,704
His hands, my loves. His hands.

325
00:20:51,871 --> 00:20:53,702
What are you going to do to me?

326
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:55,295
No! No!

327
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,400
Your Grace.

328
00:21:05,713 --> 00:21:07,363
I must warn Your Grace-

329
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:11,146
that the poor creature,
ever since she came here,

330
00:21:11,477 --> 00:21:14,140
has been in such lamentation
and heaviness

331
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:17,038
that I never saw in any creature.

332
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,365
Sometimes in a frenzy,

333
00:21:19,532 --> 00:21:22,486
that I had to remove every implement
that might have harmed her.

334
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,840
Lady Katherine!

335
00:21:33,068 --> 00:21:36,168
Lady Katherine!
Bishop Gardiner is come to see you.

336
00:21:47,772 --> 00:21:50,420
Lady Katherine, do not weep,

337
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:54,183
for I am come here with a
letter from His Majesty

338
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,149
which offers you his
most gracious mercy.

339
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,238
Madam, the King offers you mercy.

340
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:10,294
What?

341
00:22:12,494 --> 00:22:13,873
What did you say?

342
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:16,913
Here is His Majesty's letter.

343
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:21,506
In it, he offers you mercy,

344
00:22:21,829 --> 00:22:23,899
despite the...

345
00:22:24,422 --> 00:22:27,560
the grievous offences
you have committed against him,

346
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:31,516
if you will only openly
confess your faults.

347
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,640
There.

348
00:22:33,941 --> 00:22:34,941
You see?

349
00:22:37,034 --> 00:22:38,932
I humbly thank the King,

350
00:22:39,684 --> 00:22:42,321
who has shown me
more grace and mercy

351
00:22:42,488 --> 00:22:44,071
than I could have hoped for.

352
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,947
But, first,
I must ask you some questions.

353
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:51,881
And you must answer as

354
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:56,458
truthfully and honestly as you will
reply at the Day of Judgment.

355
00:23:07,116 --> 00:23:08,116
Katherine!

356
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:12,386
The King offers his hand in mercy.

357
00:23:12,553 --> 00:23:14,953
There is nothing to
be frightened of.

358
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:18,812
Come! Sit down.

359
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,183
Alas,

360
00:23:39,775 --> 00:23:42,796
My Lord, that I am alive!

361
00:23:46,219 --> 00:23:48,869
The fear of death
does not grieve me as much

362
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:51,972
as the remembrance
of the King's goodness,

363
00:23:54,844 --> 00:23:59,278
for when I remember
how gracious and loving a Prince

364
00:23:59,445 --> 00:24:02,415
I had, I cannot but sorrow.

365
00:24:07,503 --> 00:24:10,212
But this sudden mercy,

366
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,339
more than I could have looked for,

367
00:24:13,658 --> 00:24:15,871
makes my offences appear to my eyes

368
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,789
more heinous than they did before.

369
00:24:40,285 --> 00:24:42,169
You confess that

370
00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:44,249
this Francis Dereham

371
00:24:44,757 --> 00:24:46,961
came often to your bed at Lambeth?

372
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:51,336
Yes, my Lord.
He has lain with me,

373
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:55,368
sometimes in his doublet and hose,
and sometimes naked,

374
00:24:57,243 --> 00:24:59,187
but I mean, not so naked

375
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,839
that he had nothing upon him,
for he had always

376
00:25:02,006 --> 00:25:04,208
his doublet on; but I mean

377
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,463
naked when his hose was pulled down.

378
00:25:07,832 --> 00:25:09,841
In order to know you carnally?

379
00:25:14,536 --> 00:25:17,494
Was there a pre-contract
between you?

380
00:25:18,646 --> 00:25:20,197
Did you intend to marry him?

381
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:25,776
He sometimes called me
"wife" when we were together,

382
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:27,619
and I called him "husband."

383
00:25:29,283 --> 00:25:30,362
It was no contract.

384
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,609
If there was a contract,

385
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:37,109
then your marriage
to the King would be invalid,

386
00:25:37,276 --> 00:25:38,926
you might face shame...

387
00:25:40,032 --> 00:25:42,332
But you would not forfeit your life.

388
00:25:45,517 --> 00:25:48,267
He promised to love me
with all his heart.

389
00:25:50,067 --> 00:25:51,424
I think it was no contract.

390
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,458
Did Dereham have carnal knowledge

391
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:01,309
of you after you became Queen?

392
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:04,138
No, my Lord. He never did.

393
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:10,693
I'll go back to London

394
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,363
and draft

395
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,763
a plea of forgiveness for you
to submit to the King.

396
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,160
Wait!

397
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:26,009
I have important things to say.

398
00:26:27,124 --> 00:26:28,242
My Lady?

399
00:26:29,556 --> 00:26:31,882
I never consented to
sex with Francis Dereham.

400
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,954
He used importunate
force against me.

401
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,266
In a manner...

402
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:42,690
violence.

403
00:26:44,284 --> 00:26:45,434
He raped you?

404
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:53,439
The Queen confessed?

405
00:26:53,606 --> 00:26:57,288
Yes. She told me
that Dereham raped her.

406
00:26:57,835 --> 00:27:00,931
I'm sure she was lying as
and about other things too.

407
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:04,475
But I do believe that there was
some form of pre-contract

408
00:27:04,642 --> 00:27:07,832
between them, which would
invalidate the marriage.

409
00:27:08,751 --> 00:27:10,795
She claims to be innocent
after the marriage?

410
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,422
Of course.

411
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,508
- And you believed that?
- You don't believe it?

412
00:27:17,444 --> 00:27:19,721
I don't believe
anything Dereham says.

413
00:27:21,518 --> 00:27:23,058
It might not be Dereham.

414
00:27:24,737 --> 00:27:26,541
Why does Your Grace say that?

415
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:28,339
You have the Queen's confession?

416
00:27:29,874 --> 00:27:31,649
Yes, Your Majesty.

417
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,180
The Queen begs for mercy.

418
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,839
She confesses that she was
so desirous to be taken

419
00:27:39,006 --> 00:27:42,077
into Your Grace's favour, so blinded

420
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,414
by desire for worldly glory,

421
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:47,056
that she did not consider
how great a fault it was

422
00:27:47,568 --> 00:27:51,058
to conceal her former
faults from Your Majesty.

423
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:54,673
"Considering that I intended

424
00:27:55,398 --> 00:27:56,898
"ever during my life

425
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,546
"to be faithful
and true to Your Majesty."

426
00:28:00,727 --> 00:28:04,730
- We can proceed with the annulment?
- I think it would be best.

427
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,515
I don't believe that you
didn't have carnal knowledge

428
00:28:08,682 --> 00:28:10,762
of the Queen after her marriage.

429
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:13,872
Please don't! It is the truth!

430
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:16,861
Because someone else had
succeeded me in her affections.

431
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:21,491
Who?

432
00:28:28,603 --> 00:28:29,953
Thomas Culpepper.

433
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,474
Thomas Culpepper?

434
00:28:34,311 --> 00:28:35,661
The King's groom?

435
00:28:38,373 --> 00:28:39,373
Yes, sir.

436
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:47,125
How well did you know this man,
Thomas Culpepper?

437
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,150
Quite well.

438
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,313
I flirted with him

439
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,607
met him by the back stairs,
and gave him gifts.

440
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:58,337
He called me his "
sweet little fool."

441
00:29:01,663 --> 00:29:05,169
And did you commit
adultery with him?

442
00:29:10,142 --> 00:29:11,583
No, My Lord. I never did

443
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,048
although...

444
00:29:15,552 --> 00:29:17,922
Lady Rochford
encouraged me to do so.

445
00:29:22,008 --> 00:29:24,717
Lady Rochford encouraged you?

446
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:26,788
Yes, she did.

447
00:29:27,785 --> 00:29:30,320
And then she spread a vile rumour

448
00:29:30,487 --> 00:29:32,573
that we were lovers,
which we never were.

449
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,553
You don't deny that
you met with the Queen

450
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,294
- in secret on many occasions?
- No, My Lord.

451
00:29:38,461 --> 00:29:41,027
But you deny that you ever
committed adultery with her?

452
00:29:41,194 --> 00:29:42,194
I do.

453
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,668
We never passed beyond words.

454
00:29:45,996 --> 00:29:48,827
If you don't tell me the truth,
Mr. Culpepper,

455
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:51,290
you will be tortured till you do.

456
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,358
I'm telling you the truth.

457
00:29:53,804 --> 00:29:55,854
Which isn't to say
I didn't want to go further!

458
00:29:56,021 --> 00:29:58,963
I intended and meant to do so
with the Queen, and she with me.

459
00:30:01,827 --> 00:30:02,827
My God.

460
00:30:03,893 --> 00:30:07,043
That evil intent in itself
constitutes high treason.

461
00:30:09,389 --> 00:30:10,415
But it was...

462
00:30:10,736 --> 00:30:13,001
Katherine who led me on!

463
00:30:14,361 --> 00:30:15,961
She wanted it, not me.

464
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,357
And her servant, Lady Rochford,
she provoked it

465
00:30:20,524 --> 00:30:23,824
and acted as a procuress,
like some madam in a brothel!

466
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:27,200
Why are they blaming me?
It's not my fault.

467
00:30:28,842 --> 00:30:31,819
I had to stand guard when they
met in the Queen's chambers,

468
00:30:31,986 --> 00:30:33,736
or even her stool closet.

469
00:30:34,705 --> 00:30:36,055
I didn't want to.

470
00:30:37,181 --> 00:30:38,831
I didn't like doing it.

471
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:45,005
Once I even had to stop the King
coming into the Queen's bedchamber,

472
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,431
because Culpepper was already there.

473
00:30:50,386 --> 00:30:52,934
Do you think they had
carnal knowledge at those times?

474
00:30:55,738 --> 00:30:57,638
I cannot think it otherwise,

475
00:30:58,069 --> 00:31:01,139
considering all the things
I heard and saw between them.

476
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:08,167
Guard!

477
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:13,872
Do you think I shall die, my Lord?

478
00:31:15,889 --> 00:31:17,584
Do you think I shall die?

479
00:31:21,486 --> 00:31:22,936
Constable! Open up!

480
00:31:27,877 --> 00:31:30,842
Your Majesty asked me
at the beginning

481
00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:34,477
not to desist until I had got
to the bottom of the pot.

482
00:31:39,757 --> 00:31:43,761
Majesty, I fear to say that I
am already scraping the bottom,

483
00:31:45,777 --> 00:31:48,042
and a good companion
of Your Majesty,

484
00:31:48,561 --> 00:31:49,961
a fellow of trust,

485
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,899
seems certain to have
betrayed Your Majesty

486
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,207
committing adultery with the Queen.

487
00:32:02,183 --> 00:32:03,183
Who is he?

488
00:32:06,712 --> 00:32:08,968
Your groom, Thomas Culpepper.

489
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,978
So far, both of them
have denied the charges,

490
00:32:20,379 --> 00:32:22,798
though neither of them denies
the illicit meetings

491
00:32:22,965 --> 00:32:25,805
they had on the backstairs
and in the Queen's stool closet

492
00:32:25,972 --> 00:32:27,695
during Your Majesty's last progress.

493
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,699
Lady Rochford
and other maids of Her Majesty have

494
00:32:33,866 --> 00:32:36,416
come forward
with corroborating evidence

495
00:32:37,203 --> 00:32:39,153
of their frequent intimacies.

496
00:32:43,486 --> 00:32:46,839
This letter was discovered
in Mr. Culpepper's chambers.

497
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,432
It is the Queen's handwriting.

498
00:32:53,831 --> 00:32:54,881
She writes:

499
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,338
"It makes my heart die to think

500
00:32:58,505 --> 00:33:00,843
"I cannot always be
in your company."

501
00:33:01,128 --> 00:33:05,483
"I heard that you were sick
and longed so much to see you."

502
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:11,033
And it is signed:

503
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,802
"Yours as long as life endures

504
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,146
"Katherine."

505
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:22,559
What has happened is your fault!

506
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,320
Your fault!

507
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,187
You solicited me to marry her!

508
00:33:30,065 --> 00:33:32,719
How misfortunate I am to have had
so many ill-conditioned wives!

509
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,475
I vow that any pleasure
that wicked bitch got from

510
00:33:37,642 --> 00:33:40,335
her wantonness will
be nothing, nothing

511
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,937
in comparison to the pain
she going to feel

512
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,814
at the hand of my torturer!

513
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,306
Well done, wife.

514
00:34:04,511 --> 00:34:05,918
What shall we call him?

515
00:34:08,754 --> 00:34:09,754
Thomas.

516
00:34:12,531 --> 00:34:14,796
Very well. Thomas he is.

517
00:34:25,936 --> 00:34:28,441
You want to ask Lady Rochford
some more questions?

518
00:34:28,885 --> 00:34:31,167
- Yes.
- There's no point, Sir Thomas.

519
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:33,911
Lady Rochford has gone mad.

520
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:37,167
Death to you!

521
00:34:43,964 --> 00:34:45,164
There you are.

522
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,894
Majesty? His Grace,
the Duke of Suffolk.

523
00:35:02,757 --> 00:35:05,197
You've never read the Bible,
have you, Charles?

524
00:35:05,741 --> 00:35:09,107
No, Your Majesty.
I've always allowed others,

525
00:35:09,489 --> 00:35:11,859
with more knowledge than I,
to read it for me.

526
00:35:13,342 --> 00:35:16,114
In that case, you've missed
many great sayings and truths,

527
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,700
Like this one here
in the Book of Solomon:

528
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:22,837
"The lips of a harlot are
"a dropping honeycomb.

529
00:35:23,974 --> 00:35:26,699
"Her throat is softer than oil.

530
00:35:28,828 --> 00:35:29,992
"Yet in the end,

531
00:35:30,819 --> 00:35:33,047
"she is as bitter as wormwood,

532
00:35:33,481 --> 00:35:35,593
and as sharp
as a double-edged sword."

533
00:35:36,318 --> 00:35:37,542
Why have you come?

534
00:35:40,063 --> 00:35:41,972
King Francis has sent you a letter.

535
00:35:42,175 --> 00:35:43,355
What does it say?

536
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:54,902
"I am sorry to hear of the displeasure
and trouble which has been

537
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:57,447
caused "by the lewd and naughty
behavior of the Queen.

538
00:36:01,613 --> 00:36:04,495
"But knowing my brother to be
a prince of prudence and honor,

539
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:08,332
"I do require him
to throw off the said displeasure

540
00:36:08,597 --> 00:36:12,211
"and wisely, temperately,
like myself,

541
00:36:13,056 --> 00:36:16,037
"not reputing his honour to rest
in the lightness of a woman,

542
00:36:16,204 --> 00:36:19,659
"but to thank God of all,
comforting himself in God's goodness.

543
00:36:20,128 --> 00:36:23,973
"The lightness of women cannot
bend the honour of men."

544
00:36:25,055 --> 00:36:26,559
You tell Francis to go.

545
00:36:30,136 --> 00:36:31,666
Tell His Majesty

546
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:34,025
that we are grateful
for his solicitations.

547
00:36:35,246 --> 00:36:37,529
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- What of Dereham and Culpepper?

548
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,803
- They've been arraigned for treason?
- They were tried together.

549
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,285
At the last moment, Culpepper
changed his plea to guilty,

550
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,284
but both were found so.

551
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,084
They are due to be hanged,
drawn and quartered together at Tyburn.

552
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,172
Tell the judge to commute
Culpepper's sentencing to beheading.

553
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,966
I hate Dereham more,

554
00:36:59,672 --> 00:37:01,219
since he spoiled the Queen for me.

555
00:37:03,753 --> 00:37:06,018
Now, what of Lady Rochford?

556
00:37:07,914 --> 00:37:11,358
She has been found guilty
of misprision and treason

557
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,814
but, since she is insane,

558
00:37:15,532 --> 00:37:17,182
she cannot be executed.

559
00:37:19,828 --> 00:37:22,835
You tell Richard Rich
to pass a bill in Parliament

560
00:37:23,002 --> 00:37:25,451
making it legal to execute
an insane person for treason.

561
00:37:26,426 --> 00:37:27,526
Do you hear?

562
00:37:31,192 --> 00:37:32,416
Yes, Your Majesty.

563
00:37:44,337 --> 00:37:48,137
You were one of those who placed
Katherine Howard in front of me.

564
00:37:51,498 --> 00:37:52,598
Any regrets?

565
00:37:57,864 --> 00:37:58,864
Charles.

566
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,216
Majesty.

567
00:38:45,404 --> 00:38:47,754
You should be ashamed of yourselves!

568
00:38:49,881 --> 00:38:51,080
Traitor!

569
00:38:51,723 --> 00:38:53,123
"Master Culpepper,

570
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:55,732
"I heartily recommend me unto you,

571
00:38:56,316 --> 00:38:58,920
"praying you to send me
word how that you do.

572
00:38:59,874 --> 00:39:01,430
"I heard that you were sick,

573
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:04,966
"and never longed so much
for anything as to see you.

574
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,782
"I would you were with
me now that you might see

575
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:13,249
"what pain I take in writing to you.

576
00:39:15,515 --> 00:39:17,565
"It makes my heart die to think

577
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,338
"I cannot always be
in your company."

578
00:39:31,976 --> 00:39:33,829
I beg you all to pray for me.

579
00:39:51,497 --> 00:39:52,889
"He, Dereham,

580
00:39:53,186 --> 00:39:55,286
"gave me lots of lovers' tokens.

581
00:39:56,295 --> 00:39:58,963
"He knew a little woman in London
with a crooked back,

582
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:02,056
"who was skilled
in making flowers of silk,

583
00:40:02,524 --> 00:40:05,474
"who made for him a French fennel
to give to me.

584
00:40:06,336 --> 00:40:09,602
"And later, a heart's ease
for a New Year's present,

585
00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:12,284
"and some sarcenet,
which I had made into a quilted cap.

586
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,424
"He called me "wife,"

587
00:40:18,123 --> 00:40:20,459
"and touched the secret
parts of my body.

588
00:40:32,383 --> 00:40:35,750
"I remember I gave him
a collar and sleeves for a shirt.

589
00:40:37,543 --> 00:40:38,549
"And one day,

590
00:40:38,716 --> 00:40:41,647
"he snatched a silver bracelet
from me and kept it,

591
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,127
"saying,'Here, wife, a gift for me.'

592
00:40:45,339 --> 00:40:48,654
"And he kissed me often
and so passionately

593
00:40:49,331 --> 00:40:52,450
"that everyone said he would
never have kissed me enough."

594
00:41:58,549 --> 00:41:59,758
Katherine Howard,

595
00:42:00,316 --> 00:42:02,726
you are indicted for
having led an abominable,

596
00:42:02,893 --> 00:42:05,431
base, carnal, voluptuous,

597
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:08,981
and vicious life before
marriage like a common harlot-

598
00:42:09,454 --> 00:42:10,653
with several persons.

599
00:42:11,332 --> 00:42:13,596
You led the King by word
and gesture to love you,

600
00:42:13,763 --> 00:42:16,116
concealing your contract
with Francis Dereham

601
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:19,161
to the peril of the King
and his children begotten by you.

602
00:42:20,618 --> 00:42:21,996
And after marriage,

603
00:42:22,684 --> 00:42:25,333
you showed the same Dereham
notable favour,

604
00:42:26,107 --> 00:42:28,588
while inciting Thomas Culpepper...

605
00:42:28,984 --> 00:42:30,297
to carnal knowledge,

606
00:42:31,229 --> 00:42:32,279
telling him

607
00:42:33,524 --> 00:42:35,116
you loved him above the King.

608
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,950
It is my duty...

609
00:42:42,121 --> 00:42:43,686
to escort you to the Tower.

610
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,540
My Lady.

611
00:42:55,524 --> 00:42:56,574
Sir Edward.

612
00:42:57,699 --> 00:42:58,927
Don't let them.

613
00:43:12,777 --> 00:43:13,724
No.

614
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:48,350
God!

615
00:43:54,284 --> 00:43:56,300
- My Lady.
- No, no, no, no!

616
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:08,479
Is she condemned?

617
00:44:09,211 --> 00:44:10,439
Yes, Your Majesty.

618
00:44:11,885 --> 00:44:13,335
What of the others?

619
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:16,913
Dereham and Culpepper
have been executed

620
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,350
and the bill allowing
a mad person to be executed

621
00:44:20,517 --> 00:44:21,909
for treason has become law.

622
00:44:29,082 --> 00:44:30,551
I want to have a party.

623
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,511
- Here is a list of guests.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

624
00:45:19,431 --> 00:45:22,339
Katherine Howard, I have to tell
you that you are going to die.

625
00:45:22,896 --> 00:45:26,341
You'll be taken tomorrow morning,
the 13th of February,

626
00:45:26,508 --> 00:45:28,926
escorted by members
of the Privy Council.

627
00:45:35,447 --> 00:45:36,817
May I ask one favour?

628
00:45:40,585 --> 00:45:42,635
Will you bring the block to me-

629
00:45:44,154 --> 00:45:46,604
so that I might know
how to place myself

630
00:45:47,332 --> 00:45:48,332
and...

631
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:50,549
make trial of it?

632
00:45:52,032 --> 00:45:53,132
As you wish.

633
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:55,908
Is there anything else you need?

634
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,387
Do you want a confessor?

635
00:46:00,919 --> 00:46:01,919
No.

636
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:05,788
I have spoken to God so rarely,

637
00:46:06,151 --> 00:46:08,557
I did not think
He would know who I was.

638
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,480
Ladies.

639
00:46:59,206 --> 00:47:00,234
Something sweet?

640
00:47:19,767 --> 00:47:21,880
What do you think? Your Majesty.

641
00:47:30,207 --> 00:47:31,556
A beautiful Queen.

642
00:49:35,062 --> 00:49:37,723
Madam. - Do you want
to say a few words?

643
00:49:42,614 --> 00:49:43,483
I...

644
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:47,025
ask forgiveness for my sins,

645
00:49:49,669 --> 00:49:51,781
from His Gracious Majesty,

646
00:49:54,368 --> 00:49:55,368
from God,

647
00:49:57,722 --> 00:50:00,400
and from all of you.

648
00:50:07,858 --> 00:50:09,185
Shall I say more?

649
00:50:09,578 --> 00:50:11,721
No, my Lady.
That is already sufficient.

650
00:50:14,534 --> 00:50:15,534
Thank you.

651
00:51:29,794 --> 00:51:30,955
It's time, my Lady.

652
00:51:49,652 --> 00:51:51,441
I have come here to die.

653
00:51:56,128 --> 00:51:57,689
I die a Queen.

654
00:51:59,422 --> 00:52:02,942
But I would rather die
the wife of Culpepper...

655
00:52:27,583 --> 00:52:28,583
Life is...

656
00:52:29,881 --> 00:52:31,396
very beautiful.
