00:00:00,192 --> 00:00:01,501
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:06,934 --> 00:00:08,879
I congratulate Your Majesty.

3
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,558
You have capted one
of the most french beautiful town.

4
00:00:11,725 --> 00:00:15,098
We have gained here a singular victory.
I mean to hold onto it.

5
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,850
I'll leave Surrey in command.

6
00:00:17,693 --> 00:00:19,853
- Surrey?
- Yes. Is that a problem?

7
00:00:20,774 --> 00:00:23,481
Those men that are made
by the King of vile birth

8
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:26,776
have been the distraction of all
the nobility of this realm.

9
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:29,195
And if God calls away the King,

10
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:30,940
they will suffer for it.

11
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,158
You'll teach the Earl
a lesson in humility.

12
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,366
You could arrange for some
misfortune to befall him.

13
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:39,539
I hear your master has signed
a separate treaty with the French.

14
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,082
I trusted him.
You should be relieved

15
00:00:42,249 --> 00:00:44,461
that you no longer
have to lie on his behalf!

16
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,669
Sister, you know that I never
wanted to marry the King.

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,146
I may at least use
what influence I now possess

18
00:00:52,313 --> 00:00:54,888
to further the cause that
I believe in with all my heart.

19
00:00:55,671 --> 00:00:58,350
She's a heretic
and still you leave me in her care!

20
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:02,570
I swear that I will burn
however many heretics I have to.

21
00:01:02,737 --> 00:01:05,062
I will make England faithful again.

22
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,443
The King's enterprise
has bankrupted our exchequer.

23
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,613
We don't know how to get revenues
to pay for the Boulogne campaign.

24
00:01:12,086 --> 00:01:14,699
This war has proved disastrous
to the realm.

25
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,743
Even our Queen is a heretic.

26
00:01:17,252 --> 00:01:19,852
And it will be God's work
to destroy her.

27
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,041
I want my victory to be celebrated
in every house in England.

28
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,670
I want the name Boulogne
imprinted on every English heart.

32
00:03:22,191 --> 00:03:23,191
Majesty.

33
00:03:45,528 --> 00:03:47,412
I will have no married priests.

34
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,775
Your Majesty.
Lord Hertford desires an audience.

35
00:04:05,302 --> 00:04:06,304
Hertford.

36
00:04:06,471 --> 00:04:09,041
Your Majesty. We have
received news from France.

37
00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:12,452
The Earl of Surrey,
while rashly attacking

38
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,981
French supply forces at Saint-Etienne,
just beyond Boulogne,

39
00:04:16,148 --> 00:04:18,216
has lost over 600 men,

40
00:04:19,323 --> 00:04:21,469
as well as all the captains
and gentlemen,

41
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,389
who, for some reason,
he had placed in the front line.

42
00:04:42,842 --> 00:04:45,159
My lords, I have heard
from several sources

43
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,559
of the calamitous events
in Boulogne.

44
00:04:48,532 --> 00:04:49,979
It seems my Lord Surrey

45
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:52,463
gave battle to a large
convoy of French,

46
00:04:52,842 --> 00:04:54,402
and was soundly defeated.

47
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,028
With the death of his captains,

48
00:04:57,877 --> 00:04:59,607
and most of his gentlemen.

49
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:01,384
And all of this,

50
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,013
despite my warnings not to be bold
and place Boulogne at risk.

51
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,479
Therefore,

52
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,968
I have commanded him to return here,

53
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:13,270
to be examined as to his conduct
by Your Lordships.

54
00:05:14,503 --> 00:05:15,660
In the meantime,

55
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,367
I will appoint you, My Lord Hertford,
as his replacement.

56
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,485
You leave at once for Boulogne.

57
00:05:23,142 --> 00:05:26,326
I have also decided
for his many great works and talents,

58
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,997
to appoint my secretary,
Mr. Risley, Lord Chancellor,

59
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,167
and to create him Baron Risley.

60
00:05:35,611 --> 00:05:37,064
I am touched and...

61
00:05:37,945 --> 00:05:39,714
deeply honored
by Your Majesty's trust.

62
00:05:42,398 --> 00:05:44,260
- My Lord Suffolk?
- Majesty,

63
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,638
there are rumors
of a large French fleet

64
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,057
being assembled
and fitted out for war.

65
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:53,019
Also... the Emperor has ordered

66
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,522
all English ships and properties
in the Low Countries to be seized.

67
00:05:57,414 --> 00:05:58,964
How shall we respond?

68
00:06:00,413 --> 00:06:01,613
The Emperor...

69
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:03,963
my God.

70
00:06:05,263 --> 00:06:07,671
When I think of my fidelity
to my friends

71
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:10,453
and all of their betrayals?

72
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,787
Fleet being amassed...

73
00:06:20,653 --> 00:06:22,980
- My Lord Hertford.
- Excellency.

74
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:25,639
May we speak a moment, privately?

75
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:34,477
Well?

76
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:38,564
It seems that many things are amiss
in His Majesty's kingdom.

77
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,608
What things?

78
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,610
The bad harvest and the burden
of His Majesty's debts.

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,133
The plague among the sailors
of His Majesty's fleet

80
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,702
with their swollen heads
and decayed ships.

81
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,162
Pray, Excellency,
what is your point?

82
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:55,820
The poisoning and the poverty...

83
00:06:56,132 --> 00:06:57,663
of the King's realm...

84
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,630
is in every way due to his rash

85
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,090
and unsustainable
occupation of Boulogne...

86
00:07:04,886 --> 00:07:06,595
As Your Lordship would want.

87
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:12,623
It is true that I argued
against the war.

88
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,246
But I lost the argument.

89
00:07:15,824 --> 00:07:17,581
You lost the argument for war,

90
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:19,480
But you can win it for peace.

91
00:07:22,094 --> 00:07:23,649
Persuade the King...

92
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,412
of his folly
in hanging on to Boulogne,

93
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,214
against all reason.

94
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,785
You and I may come
to some agreement.

95
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,176
- My Lord.
- Mr. Risley, Your Grace.

96
00:07:38,343 --> 00:07:40,243
You are to be congratulated.

97
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,097
Thank you, Your Grace.

98
00:07:42,435 --> 00:07:43,435
I confess,

99
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,438
I find this sudden elevation
beyond my imagining.

100
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:47,605
No!

101
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,726
But you must imagine it,

102
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:52,186
and take great pleasure in it,
as we do.

103
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,767
For surely, this must mean
that our cause is in the ascendancy,

104
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,487
and that His Majesty tends
ever more firmly

105
00:07:58,654 --> 00:08:02,355
towards the Orthodox, and Catholic
persuasion and against Reform.

106
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:05,854
Well, I trust Your Grace is right.

107
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:08,336
But for my own part,

108
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:11,546
I still find the King so changeable,

109
00:08:12,232 --> 00:08:14,278
I wonder if he knows his own mind.

110
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:20,666
Father!

111
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:21,916
Come here!

112
00:08:22,873 --> 00:08:25,713
It's good to see you back at Court.
I missed you.

113
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,143
- You remember Brigitte?
- Yes, of course!

114
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:35,348
Bonjour, Henry.
I'm very happy to see you again.

115
00:08:41,006 --> 00:08:43,189
Mademoiselle Roussello
is now my official mistress.

116
00:08:45,502 --> 00:08:48,663
I am sorry to hear that her presence
at Court makes your mother,

117
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:51,088
unhappy.
But there is no help for it,

118
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:53,866
for your mother has made me
unhappy for a long time.

119
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,626
- Poor Henry.
- No.

120
00:08:55,793 --> 00:08:57,452
He's old enough to know the truth.

121
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,124
And guess other things about love.

122
00:09:02,351 --> 00:09:03,459
Mademoiselle,

123
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,379
if you make my father happy,
then you have also made me happy.

124
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:08,934
See?

125
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,976
He's older and wiser than he looks.

126
00:09:11,143 --> 00:09:13,094
- So are you.
- Right.

127
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:14,563
Drinks.

128
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:23,020
- How is Your Majesty?
- I'll tell you this, Kate.

129
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:25,410
I felt ten times better in France

130
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:27,579
than I have these past years since.

131
00:09:29,398 --> 00:09:31,147
What I hate above everything...

132
00:09:31,566 --> 00:09:33,266
are the interpretations.

133
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:36,568
It doesn't seem to matter
who I talk to at Court.

134
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:37,835
Ambassadors,

135
00:09:38,462 --> 00:09:39,462
clerics,

136
00:09:39,968 --> 00:09:41,039
courtiers...

137
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,233
They all interpret the facts
to suit themselves.

138
00:09:46,534 --> 00:09:49,513
God knows I've always spoken
with candour and honesty.

139
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:51,632
But all about me now is guile,

140
00:09:52,464 --> 00:09:54,805
hypocrisy, and dishonesty.

141
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:02,518
Your Majesty, I have written a book.

142
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,096
May I show it to you?

143
00:10:05,263 --> 00:10:06,263
A book?

144
00:10:06,943 --> 00:10:08,024
What kind of book?

145
00:10:10,816 --> 00:10:13,216
It's called
Lamentations of a Sinner.

146
00:10:14,222 --> 00:10:15,222
Majesty.

147
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,074
Do read the dedication.

148
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:26,615
"In praise of my most
sovereign lord and husband,

149
00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:27,996
"King Henry VIII,

150
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:31,130
"who is not only godly and learned,

151
00:10:31,592 --> 00:10:33,313
"but who is also our Moses,

152
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:37,102
"since he has delivered us
out of the captivity of the Pharaoh."

153
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,847
You mean Rome.

154
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:49,023
You call the Pope's clergy riffraff,

155
00:10:49,868 --> 00:10:51,698
which he planted in his tyranny?

156
00:10:54,973 --> 00:10:57,475
"And in eternal gratitude
to my Lord and husband,

157
00:10:57,884 --> 00:11:00,830
"who has shown me by his works
a holier path,

158
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:04,580
"and delivered me from
the ignorance of my blind faith."

159
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,041
- Do you mean this?
- I do, Your Majesty.

160
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:11,879
And not just for myself.

161
00:11:13,168 --> 00:11:15,469
I mean it for all your subjects.

162
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,568
Your Majesty.
Bishop Gardner is here.

163
00:11:46,398 --> 00:11:48,309
I ask permission...

164
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:51,302
To arrest and interrogate a known...

165
00:11:52,272 --> 00:11:54,922
Heretic and Protestant
called Anne Askew,

166
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:58,265
for fear that she has...

167
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,429
friends here at Court.

168
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,976
You have my permission, Your Grace.

169
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:24,308
Good English people.

170
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:25,786
They tell us

171
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,687
that some of us are not fit
to read the words

172
00:12:28,854 --> 00:12:30,874
of our Saviour and Lord.

173
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:35,630
I say to you, I would rather
read five lines in the Bible

174
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,215
than hear five masses in the temple!

175
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,302
The priest claims to turn

176
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,352
the wine into God's blood,

177
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:45,964
and the bread into God's body!

178
00:12:46,403 --> 00:12:47,937
But where is the proof?

179
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:49,643
Go and find

180
00:12:49,893 --> 00:12:51,343
the proof yourself!

181
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,636
Let the bread lie in the box

182
00:12:53,803 --> 00:12:55,904
for three months, it will be mouldy,

183
00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:58,569
and so turn to nothing that is good.

184
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,645
- Make way!
- Wherefore, I am persuaded

185
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:03,491
that it cannot be God!

186
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,238
- Arrest that woman!
- Faith

187
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,280
is my shield.
I now rejoice at heart,

188
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,625
and hope bid me do so,

189
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,554
for that you shall take my part
and ease me of my woe!

190
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:19,807
For that you hurt my delight.

191
00:13:19,974 --> 00:13:23,010
No face, Lord, to those who look...

192
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:25,105
My Lord Surrey,

193
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:28,833
it has been put to us
that your defeat at Saint-Etienne

194
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,703
was not, as you claimed,

195
00:13:31,072 --> 00:13:33,197
due to the unwillingness
of your soldiers,

196
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:34,990
but to your own folly.

197
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,096
And an empty confidence
in your own unreasoning bravery.

198
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,821
- How do you answer such a charge?
- I would answer

199
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,849
it was not such a defeat.
There was loss

200
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:46,557
and victory on both sides,
and as a matter of fact,

201
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:48,734
the enemy took more losses than we.

202
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,712
Even so, my Lord, our loss
was the more grievous,

203
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,708
since we lost all our captains,

204
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,619
who you, regardless of the danger,

205
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,089
- sent into the front line.
- I think you were never in battle.

206
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:04,688
Those officers wanted
to be in the front line.

207
00:14:05,571 --> 00:14:07,943
They charged with a cry
and with greater courage

208
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,753
and in as good an order
as anyone would wait for.

209
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:14,263
They were outnumbered,
but they broke through the enemy lines.

210
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,690
They destroyed four-fifths
of the convoy.

211
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:19,233
At that moment,
the French were in disarray,

212
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,669
and if the few men

213
00:14:20,836 --> 00:14:22,755
that this council had sent me

214
00:14:22,922 --> 00:14:24,363
had not panicked and bolted,

215
00:14:25,088 --> 00:14:26,741
then His Majesty would now

216
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,397
be celebrating a great victory.

217
00:14:31,763 --> 00:14:33,713
But alas, my Lord, he is not.

218
00:14:34,913 --> 00:14:37,793
You took a risk in attacking
an enemy far superior in numbers,

219
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:39,735
and you lost.

220
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:43,746
You were forced to flee
the battlefield, which is reprehensible.

221
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:47,787
And one of only three ways
by which a knight companion

222
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:50,556
can be degraded
from the Order of the Garter.

223
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:54,059
My Lord Surrey,

224
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:57,063
my brother, has already

225
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,781
announced allegations against you
for corrupt misuse of office

226
00:14:59,948 --> 00:15:02,114
while you were Lieutenant General.

227
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,028
He has announced
an immediate purge on those

228
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,573
that you appointed
to positions of authority.

229
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,463
Sir, believe me.

230
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:13,272
There are just too many witnesses
that will tell you

231
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:15,664
that Henry Howard
was never corrupted

232
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,606
by personal considerations.

233
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:21,983
Nor did his hand ever
close upon a bribe.

234
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,299
This council must confirm
your removal as Lieutenant General,

235
00:15:26,088 --> 00:15:29,011
as well as revoke your former
title, Captain of Boulogne.

236
00:15:29,586 --> 00:15:30,702
You are ordered

237
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:32,473
not to return to France.

238
00:15:34,162 --> 00:15:36,053
I'm sure His Majesty will see fit

239
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,241
to countermand these orders

240
00:15:39,262 --> 00:15:41,732
- after I have talked with him.
- My Lord,

241
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:45,740
His Majesty has refused
to grant you an audience.

242
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:51,708
Has he?

243
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,847
Sir Richard Rich.

244
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,544
You have some news?

245
00:16:11,723 --> 00:16:13,931
I regret to inform you
that Eustace Chapuys,

246
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,517
once Imperial Ambassador here,
has died,

247
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,944
soon after returning to Spain.

248
00:16:40,756 --> 00:16:42,406
He was a remarkable man.

249
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:45,838
And a true friend.

250
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:51,302
Now, I have nobody.

251
00:16:55,712 --> 00:16:56,890
Let me assure you

252
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,191
that you still have many true friends
here at Court.

253
00:17:00,972 --> 00:17:02,229
Not least, Bishop Gardner.

254
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:07,253
And Edmund Bonner, Bishop of London,
as well as many others

255
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,370
who share the Catholic faith.

256
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,513
Who continue to believe

257
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:14,450
as you believe.

258
00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:17,338
And you?

259
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
Yes.

260
00:17:34,272 --> 00:17:37,742
My poor brother is being brought up
a Protestant and a heretic.

261
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,809
And the King does nothing
to stop it.

262
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:42,662
Be assured,

263
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:44,932
there is work a foot to stop it.

264
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,806
But My Lord Gardner needs to know

265
00:17:47,973 --> 00:17:50,583
that in these works,
he has your support...

266
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:54,675
Even though they may touch
people close to you.

267
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,981
Send my love to His Grace.

268
00:18:04,905 --> 00:18:07,878
Tell him I will pray fervently
for his success.

269
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:13,125
Anne Askew.

270
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:16,512
- Yes, sir.
- We hear that you still

271
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:19,890
openly, and in public,
preach heresy.

272
00:18:20,718 --> 00:18:23,160
I preach the Word of God, sir.

273
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:25,527
To all who will listen.

274
00:18:25,694 --> 00:18:27,356
It seems you have friends at Court.

275
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:31,819
But then, your brother once served
in the King's household, I think.

276
00:18:33,366 --> 00:18:36,115
We think these friends may include

277
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,466
some ladies in waiting
to Her Majesty.

278
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,653
The Duchess of Suffolk, for example.

279
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,790
Or Lady Herbert, the Queen's sister.

280
00:18:45,346 --> 00:18:46,625
You've received monies,

281
00:18:47,364 --> 00:18:49,503
whilst you've been imprisoned,
for your relief.

282
00:18:50,603 --> 00:18:51,753
We believe...

283
00:18:52,123 --> 00:18:54,992
That diverse important ladies

284
00:18:55,732 --> 00:18:57,131
sent you that money.

285
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,870
There was a man in a blue coat

286
00:19:04,112 --> 00:19:05,769
who delivered me ten shillings.

287
00:19:06,283 --> 00:19:07,783
And what did he say?

288
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,541
He said,

289
00:19:12,382 --> 00:19:14,873
"My Lady Hertford sent it to me."

290
00:19:15,231 --> 00:19:18,031
With the support
and permission of the Queen.

291
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:23,460
Come, come, Mistress Askew!

292
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:26,436
We can make you speak.

293
00:19:37,896 --> 00:19:41,825
Have her moved down
one level to the chamber.

294
00:19:44,025 --> 00:19:47,133
- Your Grace, I cannot allow...
- You will do as we say...

295
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:49,199
Sir Edmund.

296
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,880
Please. Please!

297
00:20:29,015 --> 00:20:30,265
Mistress Askew.

298
00:20:35,927 --> 00:20:39,363
Your Grace has been misinformed
as to the events in Boulogne.

299
00:20:40,249 --> 00:20:42,116
I am very prepared to believe it.

300
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,184
Again and again, the Council refused

301
00:20:44,351 --> 00:20:46,453
to send reinforcements
that I asked for.

302
00:20:47,627 --> 00:20:50,519
Even the garrison at Calais
refused to help,

303
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,646
except to send some flat-footed,

304
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:56,103
squint-eyed, unshapely men
unfit to carry arms.

305
00:20:56,573 --> 00:20:59,586
And now, my command is revoked.

306
00:21:01,224 --> 00:21:02,845
Now, I am a man of no service.

307
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,496
No activity.

308
00:21:05,058 --> 00:21:07,432
And I must sit at home
within the walls.

309
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:10,898
Do not think of this
as the end of your life, My Lord.

310
00:21:11,207 --> 00:21:14,131
God has given you grace,
courage, liberality.

311
00:21:14,448 --> 00:21:15,915
And after Saint-Etienne,

312
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:18,676
He also gave you good luck.

313
00:21:21,523 --> 00:21:23,433
Luck deserted you for a moment,

314
00:21:24,552 --> 00:21:26,059
but if the rest go on,

315
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:29,881
then you will soon serve
the King's Majesty again, and...

316
00:21:30,325 --> 00:21:32,249
have every chance to regain

317
00:21:32,716 --> 00:21:34,331
your honor and reputation.

318
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,211
I thank you for your words,

319
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,694
but the truth of it is,
I was undermined

320
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:41,967
and attacked from the start
of my command in Boulogne.

321
00:21:43,183 --> 00:21:45,659
And now, I swear to you,

322
00:21:46,328 --> 00:21:49,558
Hertford will smart
for usurping my place.

323
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,302
I would counsel Your Lordship

324
00:21:51,469 --> 00:21:54,479
- not to raise arms against Hertford.
- I haven't the choice.

325
00:21:56,304 --> 00:21:59,062
Your Grace, it's sure
the King will die

326
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,070
before the Prince reaches
his maturity.

327
00:22:02,353 --> 00:22:05,193
So who will then govern the Prince?

328
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,680
And the realm?

329
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,431
Just pinch her, for God's sake.
Just pinch her that's all.

330
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:21,782
Nothing more.

331
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,324
We ask you again.

332
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,518
Which of the ladies
of Her Majesty's chamber sent

333
00:22:33,768 --> 00:22:36,387
you monies or promises of relief?

334
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,147
We want to know which
of the Queen's Ladies

335
00:22:43,557 --> 00:22:45,238
share your beliefs.

336
00:22:46,305 --> 00:22:48,255
Or if the Queen herself does.

337
00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:53,999
- We must stretch her further.
- My Lords!

338
00:22:55,098 --> 00:22:58,717
It is absolutely against
the King's Law to rack a woman!

339
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,687
And I will do it no further
on my conscience.

340
00:23:01,854 --> 00:23:04,641
Come, come, you know perfectly well
we have the authority

341
00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:07,803
- of the King himself to examine her.
- I do not know at all

342
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,389
that you have His Majesty's
permission for this.

343
00:23:13,777 --> 00:23:14,777
Come!

344
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:22,613
You foolish woman.

345
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,759
Let me ask you something.

346
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,662
Do you say that priests cannot
make the body of Christ?

347
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,637
I say so, My Lord.

348
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:39,301
For I have read that God made man.

349
00:23:40,492 --> 00:23:42,235
But that man can make God,

350
00:23:42,402 --> 00:23:43,768
I have never yet read.

351
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,835
And after the consecration,
is it not the body of Christ?

352
00:23:49,843 --> 00:23:51,637
It is but consecrated bread.

353
00:23:51,804 --> 00:23:55,082
And what if a mouse eats it
after the consecration?

354
00:23:56,016 --> 00:23:57,832
What shall become of that mouse?

355
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,215
What say you?

356
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,778
Stupid woman.

357
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,772
I say that mouse is damned.

358
00:24:10,037 --> 00:24:11,585
Poor mouse.

359
00:24:52,018 --> 00:24:53,032
What is it?

360
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:56,632
Your Majesty, I must tell you
that the woman Anne Askew

361
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,799
has been put to torture in absolute
violation of Your Majesty's laws.

362
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,509
You were right to come and see me.

363
00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:22,507
So I may explain to you,
and ease your conscience.

364
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:26,066
In cases of extreme heresy,

365
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:30,650
the law makes no distinction
between a man and a woman.

366
00:25:32,504 --> 00:25:34,325
For as you know, Sir Edmund,

367
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:36,401
the devil takes many forms.

368
00:25:37,034 --> 00:25:39,623
And yet, it is always the devil.

369
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:50,373
Wake up.

370
00:25:51,163 --> 00:25:52,683
Wake up!

371
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:03,052
We desire to ask you again
about the Queen.

372
00:26:05,327 --> 00:26:06,327
Come, now.

373
00:26:07,554 --> 00:26:08,654
Speak, lady.

374
00:26:12,127 --> 00:26:14,154
His Majesty, the King!

375
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:48,999
My well-beloved Commons,

376
00:26:50,536 --> 00:26:52,836
I come here today to speak with you,

377
00:26:53,301 --> 00:26:56,489
to set forth my mind
and the secrets of my heart.

378
00:26:58,288 --> 00:27:01,342
There should be perfect love
and concord in this realm.

379
00:27:02,511 --> 00:27:06,456
But instead, there is discord
and dissention in every place.

380
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:10,962
What love and charity
is there amongst the clergy

381
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:14,841
when one calls the other
heretic and Anabaptist?

382
00:27:15,283 --> 00:27:18,146
And the other calls
him Papist and hypocrite?

383
00:27:19,611 --> 00:27:22,161
Are these tokens of charity
amongst you?

384
00:27:23,214 --> 00:27:25,664
Are these the signs
of fraternal love?

385
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,980
The people look for light.
And you bring them darkness.

386
00:27:32,475 --> 00:27:34,025
And as for the laity,

387
00:27:34,803 --> 00:27:37,155
you are not clean
of malice and envy,

388
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:40,933
for you slander
and rebuke priests and bishops.

389
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,766
You take it upon yourself
to judge the clergy

390
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:47,783
by the sole light
of your fantastical opinions

391
00:27:48,097 --> 00:27:49,668
and vain expositions.

392
00:27:50,946 --> 00:27:53,808
Although you are permitted
to read Holy Scripture,

393
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:57,614
you must understand that it is
under license

394
00:27:58,203 --> 00:28:00,303
and only to inform your conscience.

395
00:28:01,109 --> 00:28:04,243
Not to dispute and make scripture.

396
00:28:06,844 --> 00:28:08,989
I gave you the Bible
in your own tongue,

397
00:28:09,276 --> 00:28:13,066
but I am sorry to see that most precious
jewel, the Word of God,

398
00:28:14,304 --> 00:28:18,182
has been disputed, rhymed,
sung and jangled

399
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:20,657
in every alehouse
and every tavern in this realm.

400
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:26,496
I, whom God has appointed
his Vicar here,

401
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:31,251
will see these divisions extinct,
and those enormities corrected.

402
00:28:32,404 --> 00:28:36,131
Or God shall account me
an unprofitable servant.

403
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,592
Therefore...

404
00:28:40,768 --> 00:28:42,554
be of charity with one another,

405
00:28:43,404 --> 00:28:45,322
like brother and brother.

406
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,747
Love, dread, and serve God,

407
00:28:50,336 --> 00:28:52,365
to which I, as your supreme head,

408
00:28:52,532 --> 00:28:54,998
and sovereign Lord
exhort and require you.

409
00:28:56,128 --> 00:28:57,428
And I doubt not,

410
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:02,032
but that love and affinity
which I spoke of at the beginning

411
00:29:02,502 --> 00:29:06,324
shall never be dissolved
or broken between us.

412
00:29:44,761 --> 00:29:46,693
What did the King say, Sir Thomas?

413
00:29:47,337 --> 00:29:50,151
He was angry with the religious
divisions in his realm.

414
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:52,645
He said that he gave people
the Bible to read,

415
00:29:52,812 --> 00:29:55,377
but not so that they could
dispute its meanings.

416
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,438
It seems to me like His Majesty

417
00:29:57,726 --> 00:30:00,986
is like one who would throw a man
headlong off the top of a high tower

418
00:30:01,153 --> 00:30:03,685
and ask him to stop when
he is halfway down.

419
00:30:04,255 --> 00:30:07,806
But surely, our delivery from
the tyranny of Rome and blind faith

420
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:10,090
is not the end of the Reform

421
00:30:10,257 --> 00:30:13,395
and the renewal of our Christian life,
but it is only the beginning.

422
00:30:13,953 --> 00:30:16,937
The King does suppose
that only he knows the Will of God,

423
00:30:17,104 --> 00:30:20,029
and so whatever he thinks
should therefore be the new Orthodoxy,

424
00:30:20,196 --> 00:30:21,622
however fantastical.

425
00:30:21,951 --> 00:30:23,822
It is like his own private religion.

426
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,325
And yet, he asks for an end
to division for charity and love.

427
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,816
Sir Thomas, he is still the King.

428
00:30:29,983 --> 00:30:32,350
And if he asks for charity and love,

429
00:30:32,884 --> 00:30:35,268
then he is doing
no more than Christ did.

430
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:39,045
Madam, the King has opened
a Pandora's Box.

431
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,418
And whether he will or not,

432
00:30:41,585 --> 00:30:44,885
he simply cannot close it now,
whatever his complaints.

433
00:30:47,268 --> 00:30:49,318
You look troubled. What is it?

434
00:30:49,912 --> 00:30:52,884
I fear now, more than ever
the machinations of men.

435
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:57,209
How their plots and plans swirl
about the Court and the King.

436
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,568
I can sense it, but I have
no knowledge anymore.

437
00:31:01,856 --> 00:31:04,664
No one, it seems, least of all the King,
confides in me.

438
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:07,022
But is it not better so?

439
00:31:07,952 --> 00:31:11,702
In some ways, since it leaves me free
to love you at my leisure.

440
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:17,286
But in other ways, it condemns my high
station to neglect affairs of the realm,

441
00:31:17,724 --> 00:31:18,974
especially now.

442
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:22,831
Men conspire to secure his future,
and their own profit.

443
00:31:24,187 --> 00:31:27,972
But I don't understand.
How can they secure the future?

444
00:31:28,615 --> 00:31:30,138
By controlling the Prince.

445
00:31:33,412 --> 00:31:36,823
It's widely supposed
the King's infirmities grow worse.

446
00:31:38,212 --> 00:31:41,472
And he will not live to see
the Prince come to maturity.

447
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,554
Do you still love the King?

448
00:31:50,677 --> 00:31:52,444
- My Lord Hertford.
- Majesty.

449
00:31:53,033 --> 00:31:55,371
So. There is peace with France.

450
00:31:58,613 --> 00:32:01,002
Only if Your Majesty
accepts the terms.

451
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,619
What are the terms?

452
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,040
In 8 years' time,

453
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,433
Your Majesty
will hand back Boulogne.

454
00:32:17,092 --> 00:32:19,202
In return for a payment

455
00:32:20,055 --> 00:32:21,314
of 2 million crowns.

456
00:32:25,062 --> 00:32:26,062
2 million?

457
00:32:26,775 --> 00:32:27,987
Yes, Your Majesty.

458
00:32:28,835 --> 00:32:31,141
The Admiral of France,
Claude d'Annibault,

459
00:32:31,308 --> 00:32:34,494
will come here to Your Majesty's
court to sign the peace treaty.

460
00:32:35,547 --> 00:32:37,397
If Your Majesty so desires.

461
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:39,669
Your Majesty?

462
00:32:43,618 --> 00:32:46,002
You've done well, my Lord Hertford.

463
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,267
My Lord.

464
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,610
Majesty.

465
00:33:01,198 --> 00:33:05,191
His Grace, Bishop Gardner, having
examined the heretic Anne Askew,

466
00:33:06,093 --> 00:33:08,720
requests Your Majesty's permission
to order the arrests

467
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:11,044
of three of Her Majesty's ladies,

468
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:14,962
including Her Majesty's sister,
Lady Herbert.

469
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:18,223
His Grace would like
to question them

470
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,141
as to their knowledge and keeping
of forbidden materials

471
00:33:28,604 --> 00:33:29,604
What?

472
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:31,421
Stay at the door.

473
00:33:31,588 --> 00:33:32,738
Yes, my Lord.

474
00:33:37,171 --> 00:33:38,171
Gentlemen.

475
00:33:38,571 --> 00:33:39,571
My Lord.

476
00:33:44,651 --> 00:33:46,801
Here is a very great undertaking,

477
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,944
upon which our lives will depend.

478
00:33:51,134 --> 00:33:53,072
But what we must first decide

479
00:33:53,723 --> 00:33:55,954
is how best to approach Windsor...

480
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:02,069
and in what manner to overcome
the guards that surround the Prince.

481
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:04,559
And so, remove him.

482
00:34:07,368 --> 00:34:09,418
For, be in no doubt, gentlemen,

483
00:34:10,991 --> 00:34:13,741
that he who possesses
the heir to the throne

484
00:34:14,785 --> 00:34:17,335
will very soon possess
the throne itself.

485
00:34:32,307 --> 00:34:34,211
Her Majesty, the Queen!

486
00:34:43,237 --> 00:34:44,248
My Lord Risley.

487
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:45,765
Your Majesty.

488
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:49,170
Your Grace.

489
00:34:50,053 --> 00:34:51,203
Your Majesty.

490
00:34:55,477 --> 00:34:56,748
May I dance?

491
00:34:56,915 --> 00:34:58,513
Of course you may, my Lady.

492
00:35:07,764 --> 00:35:09,114
My Lord Hertford.

493
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,360
I am most glad to see you
returned from France.

494
00:35:12,997 --> 00:35:14,697
Thank you, Your Majesty.

495
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:18,059
Bishop Gardner has
arrested my sister

496
00:35:18,226 --> 00:35:20,284
and two of my ladies
on suspicion of heresy.

497
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,504
How go your investigations?

498
00:35:32,553 --> 00:35:33,703
They go well,

499
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:37,280
for we have discovered certain books

500
00:35:37,447 --> 00:35:40,594
in the closets
of the Queen's ladies,

501
00:35:40,978 --> 00:35:43,443
about which they will be
questioned further.

502
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,411
And the heretic, Anne Askew?

503
00:35:46,795 --> 00:35:48,995
Well I'm happy to tell, good lady,

504
00:35:49,453 --> 00:35:51,631
that on His Majesty's orders,

505
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:55,138
she is condemned
to be burned at Smithfield.

506
00:36:05,093 --> 00:36:06,093
SEIZE HIM!

507
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:12,290
My Lord Surrey, you are
under arrest for treason.

508
00:36:28,891 --> 00:36:29,891
Sir.

509
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:32,023
What does he want, my Lady?

510
00:36:33,183 --> 00:36:34,183
Here.

511
00:36:34,434 --> 00:36:36,393
Tie this around her neck.

512
00:36:37,804 --> 00:36:39,614
It will end her suffering quickly.

513
00:36:40,572 --> 00:36:41,574
Take it.

514
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,577
Not just for the money,

515
00:36:45,065 --> 00:36:47,015
But also for the love of God.

516
00:37:30,966 --> 00:37:32,316
My Lady Hertford.

517
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,110
What do you want?

518
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:38,965
Just to let you know that Bishop Gardner
would like to see you,

519
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,217
very soon.

520
00:37:52,592 --> 00:37:53,960
What's this?

521
00:37:54,755 --> 00:37:57,170
Gunpowder, gift from a friend.

522
00:38:51,732 --> 00:38:52,982
My Lord Surrey.

523
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,300
If the King should die,

524
00:38:57,513 --> 00:38:59,619
leaving the Lord Prince
at his tender age,

525
00:38:59,786 --> 00:39:03,660
have you either devised or suggested
who should govern him in this realm?

526
00:39:04,235 --> 00:39:07,595
Whether that is, you have ever said
that in such a case,

527
00:39:08,066 --> 00:39:10,431
you would have the rule
and governance of him?

528
00:39:10,874 --> 00:39:12,846
Or words to that effect?

529
00:39:13,013 --> 00:39:16,395
Yes, yes, cousin Knyvit.
I understood the question.

530
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:23,828
Is it true that you wilfully bear the
Royal Arms of King Edward the Confessor?

531
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:27,751
And claim to be the next heir
or kin to him?

532
00:39:29,395 --> 00:39:33,258
I only put in my coat of arms
what I am entitled to put there,

533
00:39:34,531 --> 00:39:35,682
Sir Richard.

534
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:37,166
I'll tell you this,

535
00:39:37,874 --> 00:39:40,614
if ever you got power here,
in this realm,

536
00:39:41,491 --> 00:39:43,741
I wouldgo abroad and stay there.

537
00:39:44,743 --> 00:39:47,373
Because I would be
so afraid of your malice.

538
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:51,071
Cousin Knyvit, I am maliced
not so low as you.

539
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:54,495
My malice goes much higher.

540
00:39:55,563 --> 00:39:57,436
He said his malice went even higher?

541
00:39:57,933 --> 00:39:59,333
Yes, Your Majesty.

542
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,725
My informants tell me
that it was the intention

543
00:40:02,892 --> 00:40:04,944
of Surrey and his associates

544
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:08,098
to usurp authority
by means of the murder

545
00:40:08,265 --> 00:40:11,867
of all members of the Council, and
the control of the Prince by them alone.

546
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,737
God forbid they should have succeeded
in their abominable enterprise!

547
00:40:16,904 --> 00:40:18,165
Yes, Your Majesty.

548
00:40:18,862 --> 00:40:21,062
Thank God the whole was found out.

549
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,170
I used to love him.

550
00:40:28,432 --> 00:40:31,172
Yes, I've always known
he was proud and foolish.

551
00:40:32,127 --> 00:40:33,597
But I loved him for all that.

552
00:40:38,866 --> 00:40:40,816
Now he has forfeited my love.

553
00:41:08,795 --> 00:41:09,795
Martin.

554
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:11,343
My Lord.

555
00:41:18,436 --> 00:41:20,086
Did you get the dagger?

556
00:41:20,546 --> 00:41:21,702
Yes, my Lord.

557
00:41:23,154 --> 00:41:24,167
Good man.

558
00:41:27,822 --> 00:41:29,072
Come over here.

559
00:41:51,144 --> 00:41:53,928
That's the river.
It comes right up at high tide.

560
00:41:55,662 --> 00:41:58,307
I can just about fit down
the shaft, I'm certain.

561
00:41:59,346 --> 00:42:03,046
Go now, to St. Catherine's dock,
get a boat, wait for me there.

562
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,660
I should be with you by midnight.

563
00:42:06,043 --> 00:42:08,618
For the love of God,
Martin, do as I ask,

564
00:42:08,785 --> 00:42:10,820
for if I do not escape
from this place...

565
00:42:11,624 --> 00:42:12,898
Yes, my Lord.

566
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:16,866
Sister.

567
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:20,035
There, there! Weep no more.

568
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:24,967
You were released!
Nothing has been found.

569
00:42:26,022 --> 00:42:28,129
Everything is going to be all right.

570
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,770
Believe me.

571
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:32,883
Everything is going to be all right.

572
00:42:34,487 --> 00:42:36,871
Darling Anne, you're safe.

573
00:42:38,008 --> 00:42:39,108
You're safe.

574
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,365
<i>Close the door!</i>

575
00:43:17,069 --> 00:43:19,055
He's escaping! Help me!

576
00:43:31,478 --> 00:43:33,478
My Lords, members of the jury,

577
00:43:35,108 --> 00:43:37,930
for either of the offences
the Earl has committed,

578
00:43:38,478 --> 00:43:39,700
he deserves death.

579
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:43,779
First, for usurping the Royal Arms,

580
00:43:43,946 --> 00:43:46,940
which gives rise to the suspicion
that he hoped to become King.

581
00:43:47,107 --> 00:43:48,125
The other,

582
00:43:48,943 --> 00:43:52,860
for escaping from prison,
whereby he proved his guilt.

583
00:43:53,148 --> 00:43:54,348
You are false!

584
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,538
And to earn a piece of gold,
would condemn your own father!

585
00:44:01,373 --> 00:44:03,973
I never sought to usurp
the King's Arms,

586
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,271
for everyone knows
my ancestors bore them!

587
00:44:09,668 --> 00:44:12,942
Go to the church in Norfolk.
You will see them there,

588
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,861
for they have been ours
for 500 years.

589
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,345
Hold your peace, my Lord!

590
00:44:19,968 --> 00:44:23,402
Your idea was to commit treason
and become King!

591
00:44:23,772 --> 00:44:24,772
And you!

592
00:44:25,732 --> 00:44:26,914
You cats pole!

593
00:44:29,185 --> 00:44:31,043
What have you to do with it?

594
00:44:32,107 --> 00:44:33,754
You had better hold your tongue,

595
00:44:34,778 --> 00:44:37,152
for this kingdom has never been well

596
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:41,319
since the King put mean creatures
like you into this government!

597
00:44:47,134 --> 00:44:48,519
Silence in court!

598
00:44:50,237 --> 00:44:51,313
Silence!

599
00:44:53,202 --> 00:44:55,317
If, as you say,
the accusations are false,

600
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:58,404
can you explain to us
why you tried to escape the Tower?

601
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:04,457
I tried to escape to prevent
myself from coming to the pass

602
00:45:04,624 --> 00:45:06,074
in which I am now.

603
00:45:08,946 --> 00:45:11,877
And you, my Lord, well know

604
00:45:13,151 --> 00:45:16,124
that no matter how right
a man may be,

605
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,883
they always find
the fallen one guilty.

606
00:45:22,515 --> 00:45:26,350
You have only yourself to blame,
my Lord, for the pass you're in.

607
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,840
It was a friendly foe.

608
00:45:30,651 --> 00:45:32,301
My shadow of good will.

609
00:45:33,492 --> 00:45:37,479
My old companion
and dear friend that trapped me.

610
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,270
Henry Howard, how do you plead?

611
00:45:45,297 --> 00:45:46,564
Not guilty.

612
00:45:49,564 --> 00:45:51,057
How will you be tried?

613
00:45:51,976 --> 00:45:54,756
By God, and the country.

614
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,778
I knew that I hated the Earl.

615
00:46:21,263 --> 00:46:24,537
But I am surprised, Sir Richard,
that you share my antipathy.

616
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:26,713
My Lord, you should not be
so surprised,

617
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,203
since the Earl hates us
both the same.

618
00:46:30,979 --> 00:46:34,979
So I am sure all of us will prosper
better without him.

619
00:46:36,221 --> 00:46:37,221
I agree.

620
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,076
My Lords, forgive me.

621
00:46:43,292 --> 00:46:45,812
But as foreman of the jury,
I have to tell your Lordships

622
00:46:45,979 --> 00:46:49,371
that we are not impressed with
the evidence against my Lord Surrey.

623
00:46:49,722 --> 00:46:51,433
It is very clear to us

624
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,353
that he has the right to bear the arms
of Edward the Confessor.

625
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:57,314
And as to the plot
against His Majesty,

626
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:00,464
we can find no credible
evidence to support it.

627
00:47:02,366 --> 00:47:03,366
Sirs...

628
00:47:03,969 --> 00:47:07,819
we do not think it right that the Earl
should be condemned for such...

629
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:09,161
trifles.

630
00:47:10,695 --> 00:47:13,995
Whenever has innocence been cause
to save a man's life

631
00:47:15,226 --> 00:47:17,793
when the King deems him unfit
to live in the Commonwealth?

632
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:19,172
My Lord.

633
00:47:19,939 --> 00:47:22,381
This is a trial under law.

634
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:23,831
Master Hayden,

635
00:47:24,336 --> 00:47:26,939
if you did not know it before,
then you know it now.

636
00:47:27,267 --> 00:47:30,172
The law is whatever
His Majesty says it is.

637
00:47:31,029 --> 00:47:32,599
And if you provoke His Majesty,

638
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:35,632
then you too, will feel
the full force of it.

639
00:48:06,127 --> 00:48:07,877
What is wrong, Lady Mary?

640
00:48:08,442 --> 00:48:09,692
Are you unwell?

641
00:48:10,908 --> 00:48:12,210
No, Madam.

642
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:15,225
Then?

643
00:48:18,787 --> 00:48:20,481
I have heard some rumors.

644
00:48:20,952 --> 00:48:22,941
Rumors about what, Lady Mary?

645
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:26,116
The new Imperial Ambassador
has told me

646
00:48:26,283 --> 00:48:28,755
that in Antwerp
and in other foreign places,

647
00:48:29,042 --> 00:48:31,742
that they are saying the King
is looking for a new wife.

648
00:48:33,385 --> 00:48:34,620
Why should they say so?

649
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:38,959
Despite the length of your marriage,

650
00:48:40,371 --> 00:48:43,621
you have still not presented
His Majesty with a child.

651
00:48:47,987 --> 00:48:49,535
Lady Mary.

652
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:54,602
We were such good friends.
You remember that, don't you?

653
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:59,092
Well, for me, nothing has changed.

654
00:48:59,835 --> 00:49:02,301
And I love you, as I did before.

655
00:49:03,123 --> 00:49:05,025
But something has happened,

656
00:49:05,753 --> 00:49:08,503
and you no longer love me
as you did before.

657
00:49:10,805 --> 00:49:11,805
Why?

658
00:49:13,572 --> 00:49:15,172
Gentlemen of the jury,

659
00:49:15,847 --> 00:49:17,496
how do you find the defendant?

660
00:49:29,995 --> 00:49:31,268
Guilty!

661
00:49:33,474 --> 00:49:35,049
And he should die for it!

662
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:51,412
Of what have you found me guilty?

663
00:49:54,398 --> 00:49:56,302
Surely, there is no law

664
00:49:57,206 --> 00:49:58,656
that justifies you.

665
00:49:59,645 --> 00:50:01,095
But I know the King

666
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:04,895
wants to get rid of all
the noble blood around him.

667
00:50:06,265 --> 00:50:09,840
And employ none but low people.

668
00:50:13,866 --> 00:50:16,722
- <i>Not guilty!</i>
- <i>This trial is a sham!</i>

669
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:19,507
<i>No chop, chop!</i>

670
00:50:19,674 --> 00:50:20,924
Henry Howard...

671
00:50:22,778 --> 00:50:25,344
You will be taken to the place
from whence you came,

672
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:28,536
and there, to be dragged
through the city of London

673
00:50:28,703 --> 00:50:31,549
unto the place of execution
called Tyburn!

674
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:35,159
There, to be hanged,

675
00:50:35,844 --> 00:50:39,362
cut down while still alive,
your privy parts cut off,

676
00:50:39,529 --> 00:50:42,789
and your bowels taken out
of your body and burned before you.

677
00:50:43,385 --> 00:50:45,193
Your head cut off,

678
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,645
and your body divided
into four parts.

679
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:51,651
The head and the quarters
to be set at such places

680
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:53,998
as the King shall assign.

681
00:50:54,788 --> 00:50:56,303
<i>Where's the King?</i>

682
00:50:56,569 --> 00:50:58,391
<i>This is a travesty!</i>

683
00:51:17,744 --> 00:51:19,444
<i>The happy life be these.</i>

684
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,369
<i>The quiet mind,</i>

685
00:51:23,785 --> 00:51:25,040
<i>the equal friend,</i>

686
00:51:25,895 --> 00:51:27,963
<i>no grudge, no strife,</i>

687
00:51:29,237 --> 00:51:32,387
<i>wisdom joined with simplicity,</i>

688
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:38,168
<i>the night discharged of all care.</i>

689
00:51:54,101 --> 00:51:56,822
- <i>Thank you, Lord Risley.</i>
- <i>The King is saved from conspirators.</i>

690
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,422
<i>And Anne Askew...</i>

691
00:51:59,622 --> 00:52:02,907
Sweetheart, I hear you've been busying
yourself with your books.

692
00:52:03,074 --> 00:52:04,329
Yes, Your Majesty.

693
00:52:05,187 --> 00:52:08,448
I have translated works
by Erasmus and Savonarola

694
00:52:08,982 --> 00:52:12,431
as well as buying a beautiful
book of psalms by Thomas Berthelet.

695
00:52:14,376 --> 00:52:16,576
I wonder, Kate, at your diligence.

696
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,869
Well, I regard it as much
my duty as my pleasure,

697
00:52:21,335 --> 00:52:25,322
to place such wonderful books
before the good English people

698
00:52:25,651 --> 00:52:28,092
who have been a long time
thirsting and hungering

699
00:52:28,514 --> 00:52:31,715
for the sincere and plain knowledge
of God's Word.

700
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,790
Just be cautious.

701
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:37,195
Not every English person can
read or understand the Gospels.

702
00:52:38,303 --> 00:52:41,324
And you are to be careful of the
consequences of encouraging them to try.

703
00:52:41,574 --> 00:52:45,537
Majesty, I am not afraid of the Gospels,
nor should anyone be afraid.

704
00:52:47,562 --> 00:52:49,987
Your Majesty has begun a great work

705
00:52:50,154 --> 00:52:52,467
in banishing
the monstrous idol of Rome.

706
00:52:53,357 --> 00:52:55,057
And now with God's help,

707
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:57,163
you can finish that work

708
00:52:57,973 --> 00:53:00,594
by purging the Church of England
of its dregs.

709
00:53:18,401 --> 00:53:20,182
Forgive me. I am tired.

710
00:53:39,352 --> 00:53:40,352
Kate.

711
00:54:00,832 --> 00:54:03,882
What a thing it is,
when women become such clerks,

712
00:54:05,366 --> 00:54:09,069
What a comfort it will be in my old age
to be lectured to by my wife.

713
00:54:10,099 --> 00:54:13,113
Your Majesty has no need
to be taught by anyone.

714
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,033
Your knowledge of divinity
excels that of the princes

715
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,088
and divines throughout the ages.

716
00:54:23,211 --> 00:54:24,261
Forgive me,

717
00:54:25,581 --> 00:54:27,554
but I think it unseemly

718
00:54:27,869 --> 00:54:31,171
for any of your subjects
to argue with you,

719
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:33,747
as the Queen has just done.

720
00:54:36,404 --> 00:54:39,088
Many of the greatest
subjects in the land

721
00:54:39,255 --> 00:54:42,978
defending those same arguments
that she does

722
00:54:43,896 --> 00:54:46,608
have, by law, deserved death.

723
00:54:48,334 --> 00:54:49,527
I cannot believe

724
00:54:49,694 --> 00:54:52,706
that you would accuse the Queen
of heresy without proof.

725
00:54:53,965 --> 00:54:55,485
I have the proof.

726
00:54:57,116 --> 00:54:59,155
But what I need
is Your Majesty's consent

727
00:54:59,322 --> 00:55:01,842
to draw up certain articles
against the Queen,

728
00:55:02,211 --> 00:55:04,176
so that she may be put on trial.

729
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:13,175
She could be put on trial.

730
00:55:14,553 --> 00:55:15,562
And yet,

731
00:55:16,224 --> 00:55:18,815
I am fully resolved
to spare her life.

732
00:55:19,526 --> 00:55:20,526
Certainly.

733
00:55:21,725 --> 00:55:23,725
Whatever Your Majesty desires.
