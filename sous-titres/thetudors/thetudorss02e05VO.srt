1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,464
<i>Previously... </i>

2
00:00:01,704 --> 00:00:04,217
The high and mighty
Princess of England,

3
00:00:04,726 --> 00:00:06,928
<i>There can be no question
of her legitimacy.</i>

4
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,181
<i>The line of succession is now
firmly vested in our children.</i>

5
00:00:10,421 --> 00:00:13,602
The union between King Henry
of England and Catherine of Aragon

6
00:00:13,842 --> 00:00:16,062
is declared null and void.

7
00:00:16,302 --> 00:00:18,566
The Act of Succession will also require

8
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:21,192
recognition of the King's supremacy
in all matters.

9
00:00:21,432 --> 00:00:23,536
So it must be sworn by oath after all.

10
00:00:23,696 --> 00:00:26,048
Those who refuse are put in prison.

11
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,742
Like our brother in Christ.
Bishop Fisher.

12
00:00:28,982 --> 00:00:31,171
I would reconcile you with your father

13
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,538
if you will only accept me as Queen.

14
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:35,957
I recognize no Queen but my mother.

15
00:00:36,197 --> 00:00:39,137
<i>Lady Katherine is a very proud,
stubborn woman.</i>

16
00:00:39,297 --> 00:00:42,469
Do you not believe that Catherine
wants Mary to be Queen above all else?

17
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:46,217
It is very widely rumored
that you will refuse to take the oath.

18
00:00:46,457 --> 00:00:49,280
I need hardly remind you
of the consequences of not doing so.

19
00:00:49,586 --> 00:00:52,340
If I thought my wife and children
would encourage me to die

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,534
in a good cause
I would merrily run to death.

21
00:00:55,694 --> 00:00:57,954
<i>I have decided
to make Fisher a cardinal.</i>

22
00:00:58,114 --> 00:01:00,777
<i>You will send his hat to England.
Let's see if the king</i>

23
00:01:00,937 --> 00:01:03,688
is still prepared
to prosecute and torture

24
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:05,236
a Prince of the Church.

25
00:01:05,476 --> 00:01:09,055
I am with child again.
I will still give you a son.

26
00:01:09,432 --> 00:01:10,897
And what of More?

27
00:01:11,057 --> 00:01:12,530
Will he take the oath?

28
00:01:13,572 --> 00:01:15,705
<i>There never was a servant so villainous,</i>

29
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:18,083
so traitorous to his Prince as you.

30
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,058
Why will you not swear?

31
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:22,236
I say no harm, I think no harm.

32
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:25,616
<i>And if this be not enough
to keep a man alive, I long not to live.</i>

THE TUDORS
Season 2 - Episode 5

37
00:02:51,457 --> 00:02:54,670
[ www.seriessub.com ]

38
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:02,288
Majesty,

39
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,144
His Grace Archbishop Cranmer is here.

40
00:03:09,074 --> 00:03:10,445
Your Grace.

41
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,159
Your Majesty...

42
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,976
we have had a great success
throughout the whole country

43
00:03:17,136 --> 00:03:20,319
in the swearing of allegiance
to Your Majesty as Head of the Church.

44
00:03:20,648 --> 00:03:23,830
Also in favor of your marriage
to Queen Anne.

45
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,043
But we cannot persuade

46
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:30,870
either Fisher or Thomas More
to swear the oath.

47
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:33,593
However... they may swear to part of it.

48
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,221
Sir Thomas has already told us he has no

49
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,532
argument with
the Act of Succession, and...

50
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,750
There can be no compromise.

51
00:03:43,094 --> 00:03:45,396
For if we allow them, of all men,

52
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:47,415
to swear to what they like,

53
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:49,893
then they set a precedent
for others to follow.

54
00:03:51,138 --> 00:03:53,185
In this matter, Your Grace,

55
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:54,979
it is all or nothing.

56
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:57,061
Majesty.

57
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:02,866
- Mr. Secretary.
- Majesty,

58
00:04:03,355 --> 00:04:06,470
Dame Alice,
the wife of Sir Thomas has written.

59
00:04:11,937 --> 00:04:15,622
She asks to remind you that
her husband has given long and

60
00:04:15,782 --> 00:04:18,616
true service, and he does
nothing now out of malice, but only

61
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:20,813
in the imperative of his conscience.

62
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,325
I know all about his conscience.

63
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,167
He's been wearing it
on his sleeve for years.

64
00:04:26,688 --> 00:04:29,190
When he resigned as Chancellor,
he made me a promise

65
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,037
that he would retire from the world
and live privately,

66
00:04:32,302 --> 00:04:33,674
and attend his soul.

67
00:04:34,617 --> 00:04:36,300
But this was not true.

68
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:38,465
He continued to publish pamphlets

69
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,910
about my matter and my conscience.

70
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,954
He visited Katherine.

71
00:04:43,194 --> 00:04:45,480
He cajoled others to support her.

72
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,376
In other words, he broke his promise.

73
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:52,549
He must accept the consequences.

74
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,504
Majesty.

75
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,426
Sir Thomas, you have visitors.

76
00:05:05,661 --> 00:05:06,844
Thank you.

77
00:05:08,606 --> 00:05:10,033
- Thomas!
- Alice!

78
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,606
Margaret!

79
00:05:14,102 --> 00:05:15,219
Alice!

80
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:22,237
Look at you...

81
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,038
Well, Thomas More,

82
00:05:25,278 --> 00:05:28,445
I marvel that you have always
been taken for so wise a man

83
00:05:28,605 --> 00:05:32,086
that you will now play the fool
here in this close, filthy prison

84
00:05:32,326 --> 00:05:35,849
and be content apparently to be shut up
among mice and rats.

85
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:37,347
Don't be like that!

86
00:05:37,986 --> 00:05:39,366
I assure you this is

87
00:05:40,146 --> 00:05:42,417
one of the very best rooms in the Tower.

88
00:05:43,253 --> 00:05:44,411
In fact,

89
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,510
formally, I am a guest of the Constable,

90
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,550
who just brought you here.
And I said to him before

91
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,455
that if I showed
the least sign of ingratitude

92
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:56,611
for his great generosity, he should just

93
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:59,650
throw me out of the Tower altogether!

94
00:06:02,254 --> 00:06:04,120
You know why we have come here.

95
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:07,497
I thought it was to see me.

96
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,166
Yes.

97
00:06:11,616 --> 00:06:13,118
It was to see you.

98
00:06:13,868 --> 00:06:15,138
But beyond that,

99
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:19,421
it was to ask you to swear the oath,
so that you can come home with us.

100
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,343
Alice, tell me one thing.

101
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:25,052
What is that?

102
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:29,400
Is not this house
as close to heaven as my own?

103
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,394
Good God, man. Is that all you can say?

104
00:06:37,192 --> 00:06:40,777
You were always plain speaking woman.
One of the attributes I admire you for.

105
00:06:40,937 --> 00:06:43,444
Well, then I should
tell you plainly, husband,

106
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,613
that I, and Margaret...

107
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:48,255
and all your other family...
have all sworn the oath

108
00:06:48,415 --> 00:06:50,206
and feel no worse for it.

109
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,985
I have always said that I do not

110
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:56,889
blame any other man or woman,
who has sworn.

111
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,340
I only say that I myself cannot swear.

112
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,609
Then you are thinking only of yourself.

113
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:04,627
If you are proceeded against,
as you know very well,

114
00:07:04,787 --> 00:07:07,543
all your possessions
will be forfeited to the Crown.

115
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:09,517
And we would be forced into penury.

116
00:07:10,185 --> 00:07:13,848
I have had more sleepless nights
over that issue than over anything else.

117
00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:16,539
- But still you will not swear?
- Alice...

118
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:21,487
I want you to understand,
please. I do not...

119
00:07:21,727 --> 00:07:24,813
I do not willingly seek martyrdom.

120
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:28,916
I will do everything I can

121
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:32,773
to accommodate the King and his desires.

122
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:37,964
We must remember that,

123
00:07:38,702 --> 00:07:40,317
he once made me a promise

124
00:07:42,153 --> 00:07:45,930
that he would never force me to do
anything against my conscience.

125
00:07:47,863 --> 00:07:49,983
To look first unto God,

126
00:07:50,715 --> 00:07:52,643
and only after unto him.

127
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:56,898
So, Margaret, don't be sad.

128
00:07:58,028 --> 00:07:59,400
And Alice,

129
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,550
say you are not angry with me.

130
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:05,332
Please.

131
00:08:09,194 --> 00:08:12,250
If you left, and I thought so,
I would feel

132
00:08:13,652 --> 00:08:15,999
I feel even more lonely than before.

133
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,409
I am not angry with you.

134
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,094
But I am frightened.

135
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:29,970
So very frightened.

136
00:08:44,744 --> 00:08:45,937
Your Majesty.

137
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,133
My Lady...

138
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,330
- What is it?
- Your Majesty.

139
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,073
- Your Majesty.
- My Lady...

140
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:01,492
What is it?

141
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:07,340
Oh my God.

142
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:10,310
Get the physician.

143
00:09:35,462 --> 00:09:37,000
I lost the baby.

144
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:40,229
Yes.

145
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,890
They told me.

146
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,386
We shall make
no public announcement of the fact.

147
00:10:00,744 --> 00:10:02,265
Thank you, Your Majesty.

148
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:19,733
Stand by.

149
00:10:19,893 --> 00:10:21,076
Mr. Fisher.

150
00:10:21,804 --> 00:10:24,238
I came to bring you two pieces of news.

151
00:10:26,088 --> 00:10:28,674
In the first place,
the Pope has made you a Cardinal...

152
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,853
But the second is that Parliament
has decreed

153
00:10:34,013 --> 00:10:37,153
that to maliciously deny
the King's supremacy in all matters,

154
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:39,131
is now a treasonable offence,

155
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,591
punishable by death.

156
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:45,740
So I ask you again.

157
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,950
Will you accept the King
as the Supreme Head of the Church,

158
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,537
and take the oath?

159
00:10:52,938 --> 00:10:55,279
You already know my answer to that.

160
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:02,029
My agents intercepted this letter.

161
00:11:03,578 --> 00:11:06,313
Its intended recipient was the Emperor.

162
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:10,043
In it, the writer begs the Emperor
to invade England

163
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,476
and restore what he is pleased to call

164
00:11:12,636 --> 00:11:14,573
the true Queen and the true faith.

165
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,070
Did you write this letter?

166
00:11:25,864 --> 00:11:28,127
In due course, Mr. Fisher,

167
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:31,341
you are to be arraigned for treason,

168
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:37,397
and you are to be tried
according to his Majesty's pleasure.

169
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,415
Mr. Secretary,

170
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,377
I must thank you,
for bringing word of my new hat.

171
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:50,012
At least it was not all bad news.

172
00:12:02,108 --> 00:12:03,263
Cardinal.

173
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:12,330
<i>Forgive me, Ambassador,
for receiving you like this.</i>

174
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,868
I am sad to find Your Majesty so unwell.

175
00:12:18,126 --> 00:12:19,910
Is it so surprising?

176
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:23,163
I have received visits from

177
00:12:23,323 --> 00:12:25,670
the Earl of Wiltshire and others,

178
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,325
trying to make me take the oath,

179
00:12:28,823 --> 00:12:32,100
and threatening me when I did not.

180
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:37,542
Boleyn said I should be sent
to the scaffold.

181
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:40,374
I truly believe that man

182
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,327
to be an emissary of Satan.

183
00:12:43,892 --> 00:12:47,646
Tell me, what news
of poor Bishop Fisher?

184
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:53,085
Parliament has passed
a new Treasons Act.

185
00:12:54,296 --> 00:12:57,854
Which makes "malicious" denial
of the King's supremacy,

186
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:00,403
punishable by death.

187
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,594
Poor Fisher.

188
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:08,057
He was a lion in my defense.

189
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:11,813
Now he will die alone

190
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:14,579
and ashamed in a prison cell.

191
00:13:23,586 --> 00:13:25,032
What caused it?

192
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:30,139
There was nothing.

193
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:33,240
Of course there was something!
What did you do to kill the baby?

194
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:34,901
I didn't.

195
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,122
I don't know.

196
00:13:38,162 --> 00:13:40,312
Believe me, father, I was so careful.

197
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:42,793
Welle, not careful enough.

198
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:50,655
Now...

199
00:13:51,894 --> 00:13:53,921
From now on we must all be careful.

200
00:13:55,257 --> 00:13:56,553
You especially.

201
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,211
Not to lose the King's love.

202
00:14:01,204 --> 00:14:03,289
Or everything is lost.

203
00:14:04,784 --> 00:14:05,882
Everything!

204
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:08,561
For all of us!

205
00:14:31,025 --> 00:14:33,919
Charles. I wanted to ask you a question.

206
00:14:35,927 --> 00:14:39,000
Have any of the women you've bedded
ever lied about their virginity?

207
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:43,294
Their virginity?
I'd say it's the other way around.

208
00:14:43,454 --> 00:14:45,325
Did any of them not lie about it?

209
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:46,883
Why do you ask?

210
00:14:51,646 --> 00:14:53,772
I ask Your Majesty's forgiveness.

211
00:14:54,405 --> 00:14:55,814
It doesn't matter.

212
00:14:56,088 --> 00:14:58,501
I asked for the truth,
and you told me so.

213
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:06,870
What's this?

214
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:10,400
Dismount your horse. Dismount now!

215
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,276
Down!

216
00:15:20,277 --> 00:15:21,450
Good morrow.

217
00:15:21,874 --> 00:15:23,488
Good morrow, Your Majesty.

218
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:25,507
What's your name?

219
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,930
William Webbe, Your Majesty.

220
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,602
your sweetheart's name?

221
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:35,272
Bess, Your Majesty.

222
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:40,409
Come here, Bess.

223
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,219
I assure Your Majesty

224
00:15:49,729 --> 00:15:51,766
I have a permit and permission

225
00:15:51,926 --> 00:15:54,386
to ride through Your Majesty's forest.

226
00:15:55,243 --> 00:15:57,544
I swear it and could easily prove it.

227
00:15:58,498 --> 00:15:59,839
Hello, Bess.

228
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:01,928
Your Majesty.

229
00:16:16,363 --> 00:16:17,556
Come with me.

230
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:21,527
Former!

231
00:16:39,138 --> 00:16:41,297
Are you really the King of England?

232
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:46,065
I was only pulling your leg.

233
00:16:57,126 --> 00:16:59,189
<i>Our English friend writes</i>

234
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:03,861
that "the Lady
is not to have a child after all."

235
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:06,111
He also says that the King

236
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:08,825
has already been unfaithful to her,

237
00:17:08,985 --> 00:17:11,231
But all this may mean nothing,

238
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:15,033
"considering
the changeable character of the King

239
00:17:15,353 --> 00:17:17,776
"and the craft of the Lady,

240
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:20,931
"who well knows how to manage him."

241
00:17:22,158 --> 00:17:24,940
You and I, Campeggio, have done well

242
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,083
to avoid the craft of women.

243
00:17:27,802 --> 00:17:30,534
Celibacy is an immense relief.

244
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:32,429
Yes, Holy Father.

245
00:17:33,158 --> 00:17:35,956
But our friend is still
fearful for the lives

246
00:17:36,116 --> 00:17:37,981
of Queen Katherine and her daughter.

247
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:42,024
Neither of them is safe
as long as the concubine has power.

248
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,612
I will have prayers
said for our dear sisters

249
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:48,118
and also for Cardinal Fisher.

250
00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:52,242
May God grant him the courage
to endure his tribulations.

251
00:17:52,618 --> 00:17:54,824
- Yes, Holy Father.
- On the other hand...

252
00:17:55,397 --> 00:17:56,330
Yes?

253
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:58,765
On the other hand,

254
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:01,672
in the days of
the founders of our Church,

255
00:18:01,954 --> 00:18:04,550
it was considered
a privilege to be martyred,

256
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,339
like St. Peter and the other apostles.

257
00:18:07,723 --> 00:18:09,461
Our Church was founded

258
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,949
upon the blood of these martyrs.

259
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:14,448
So perhaps it is a pity

260
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:18,608
that you and I, Campeggio,
unlike Cardinal Fisher,

261
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:21,355
no longer have the opportunity

262
00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:23,844
to die for Christ.

263
00:18:33,957 --> 00:18:35,150
Sir Thomas.

264
00:18:36,652 --> 00:18:37,910
Sir Thomas!

265
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,721
Yes. I'm here.

266
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,963
I'm here. Who are you?

267
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:53,098
John. A servant to Bishop Fisher,

268
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,759
who is kept below here.

269
00:18:55,398 --> 00:18:57,472
He asks you to be of good cheer.

270
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,108
How is he?

271
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:03,448
Truth be told, Sir,
he is old and not well.

272
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,941
He cannot eat the food here.

273
00:19:06,957 --> 00:19:09,614
But his spirit remains ever unbroken.

274
00:19:10,871 --> 00:19:12,561
Well, I am glad to hear it.

275
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,537
And not the least bit surprised.

276
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:21,384
He asks if you would ever
contemplate taking the oath...

277
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,535
and under what circumstances?

278
00:19:26,074 --> 00:19:28,328
Tell him that I cannot take the oath

279
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:32,321
without damning my soul
for all eternity.

280
00:19:33,224 --> 00:19:34,961
And that I will not do.

281
00:19:35,765 --> 00:19:37,314
Thank you, Sir, for that.

282
00:19:38,085 --> 00:19:40,583
I know it will renew
my master's courage.

283
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,479
Now I must go.

284
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:46,684
God bless you.

285
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,243
Tell me, Mr. Cromwell,

286
00:19:58,483 --> 00:20:01,452
does Sir Thomas More
still continue in his stubbornness?

287
00:20:02,353 --> 00:20:04,663
- Yes.
- You will force him to give his reasons

288
00:20:04,823 --> 00:20:08,597
for not taking the oath, or I will deem
his silence to be malicious.

289
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,177
I am appointing you
Vice-Regent in Spiritual Matters.

290
00:20:13,701 --> 00:20:16,095
It's true you are a layman
not a churchman

291
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,457
but in this matter I could not trust
the prejudices of any churchman.

292
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:55,773
My Lady, your sister has come.

293
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:07,418
Sister.

294
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,230
Mary?

295
00:21:10,182 --> 00:21:11,309
Your Majesty.

296
00:21:13,412 --> 00:21:14,862
You are with child!

297
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,227
How has it happened? We knew nothing.

298
00:21:19,994 --> 00:21:21,130
I'm married.

299
00:21:22,257 --> 00:21:23,374
Married?

300
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:25,764
So...

301
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,655
who is your husband?

302
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,253
His name is Mr. William Stafford.

303
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,174
I haven't heard of him. Is he at court?

304
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:38,393
He...

305
00:21:40,036 --> 00:21:43,557
William is a man
of little standing and no fortune.

306
00:21:43,976 --> 00:21:46,680
He is now a serving soldier in Calais.

307
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:58,328
Then you think him

308
00:21:58,896 --> 00:22:00,764
worthy to be the husband

309
00:22:00,924 --> 00:22:02,902
of the Queen of England's sister?

310
00:22:03,062 --> 00:22:04,997
Yes, father. Since I love him and I...

311
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,007
You are very much mistaken.

312
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,730
You married him in secret,

313
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:13,242
and without asking our approval.

314
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:18,326
He is such a nothing, we could never
have given our permission!

315
00:22:18,486 --> 00:22:21,151
Father, if you were to meet him,
you would see that he is

316
00:22:21,311 --> 00:22:23,574
a good, fine, honest man.

317
00:22:23,734 --> 00:22:26,277
Since you acted brazenly
and in spite of me, Mary,

318
00:22:26,437 --> 00:22:28,193
I shall cut off your allowance.

319
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:31,290
You and your fine, honest young man

320
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,211
can rot in hell,
as far as I am concerned.

321
00:22:38,755 --> 00:22:40,042
Anne...

322
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,118
How easy do you think it was for me
to find a proper husband,

323
00:22:45,358 --> 00:22:48,036
when I was called the great prostitute!

324
00:22:48,353 --> 00:22:50,916
Indeed I think myself fortunate
to have found William,

325
00:22:51,156 --> 00:22:54,544
- and to be loved by him.
- You did not ask my permission.

326
00:22:54,784 --> 00:22:57,373
Do I have to ask your permission
to fall in love?

327
00:22:57,533 --> 00:22:58,333
Yes.

328
00:23:00,242 --> 00:23:01,922
Now we are royalty.

329
00:23:02,486 --> 00:23:04,383
Everything is different.

330
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:15,705
Please.

331
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:19,497
Please.

332
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,882
Sister.

333
00:23:33,004 --> 00:23:35,332
You and your husband
are banished from court.

334
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,781
Your Honor,

335
00:24:01,452 --> 00:24:02,672
Mr. Cromwell,

336
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,365
How may I please you?

337
00:24:08,318 --> 00:24:11,799
It would please me very much
if you could give me the reason

338
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:15,375
or reasons
why you will not take the oath.

339
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,632
I have...

340
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,712
discharged my mind of all such matters,

341
00:24:20,872 --> 00:24:23,090
and will no more
dispute King's titles,

342
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,526
nor Pope's.

343
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,366
The King accuses you of stubbornness

344
00:24:31,526 --> 00:24:34,151
and obstinacy,
for not giving your reasons.

345
00:24:36,824 --> 00:24:39,275
You must have some view of the statute?

346
00:24:39,723 --> 00:24:41,735
I have this view that the

347
00:24:42,317 --> 00:24:45,447
act of Parliament is like
a double-edged sword,

348
00:24:45,607 --> 00:24:48,479
for ever a man answers one way
it confounds his body,

349
00:24:49,687 --> 00:24:51,451
and if he answers another

350
00:24:52,235 --> 00:24:53,830
it confounds his soul.

351
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:57,417
But if you did not answer at all,
you will incur penalties.

352
00:24:58,585 --> 00:25:02,425
His Majesty has commanded me to draw up
an act of attainder against you.

353
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:05,843
This will make your imprisonment
permanent.

354
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,167
Poor Alice.

355
00:25:09,431 --> 00:25:10,839
Sir Thomas,

356
00:25:12,013 --> 00:25:15,422
why will you not take the oath?
Thousands have.

357
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:20,607
Many, I am sure,
share your beliefs and your faith.

358
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:23,902
And yet, not your scruples.

359
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:27,612
Well, as for that,
some may do it for favor,

360
00:25:29,087 --> 00:25:30,683
and some for fear.

361
00:25:31,976 --> 00:25:34,900
And some may perhaps think
they can later repent and be shriven,

362
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,758
and God will forgive them.

363
00:25:39,452 --> 00:25:41,762
And some others
may be of a mind that if they

364
00:25:42,372 --> 00:25:44,165
say one thing, but think another,

365
00:25:44,325 --> 00:25:47,468
then their oath goes upon what they
think and not upon what they say.

366
00:25:50,911 --> 00:25:53,652
But I cannot use such ways
in so great a matter.

367
00:25:58,391 --> 00:25:59,912
In which case,

368
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,021
and in all honesty,

369
00:26:03,415 --> 00:26:04,645
Sir Thomas,

370
00:26:07,814 --> 00:26:10,436
you are likely to pay
the ultimate price.

371
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:18,021
Mr. Cromwell, there really

372
00:26:18,181 --> 00:26:21,415
is no difference between us,
except that I shall die today,

373
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,178
and you tomorrow.

374
00:26:46,393 --> 00:26:47,745
Forgive me,

375
00:26:47,905 --> 00:26:50,797
but aren't you Margaret More,
Sir Thomas' daughter?

376
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:52,324
Yes, sir.

377
00:26:52,972 --> 00:26:54,860
I am Eustace Chapuys,

378
00:26:55,188 --> 00:26:56,875
the Emperor's Ambassador.

379
00:26:57,294 --> 00:27:00,999
It is a great pleasure for me to meet
anyone associated with Thomas More.

380
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:03,293
Thank you, Your Excellency.

381
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:05,780
May I ask why you have come to court?

382
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,587
I have come to petition
Mr. Secretary Cromwell.

383
00:27:09,472 --> 00:27:12,026
Lately most of our lands
have been sold off

384
00:27:12,449 --> 00:27:14,815
and my family is gradually
reduced to poverty.

385
00:27:15,378 --> 00:27:17,547
Things go very hard with my mother.

386
00:27:17,977 --> 00:27:19,602
I am sorry to hear it.

387
00:27:20,387 --> 00:27:23,230
I am sorry for many things
that are occurring in this kingdom.

388
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,232
The good seem to suffer,

389
00:27:25,472 --> 00:27:27,142
and the wicked to prosper.

390
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:33,102
- Oh! Mark!
- Majesty?

391
00:27:34,064 --> 00:27:36,787
You're a free spirit. I love that.

392
00:27:43,983 --> 00:27:45,964
Everyone else constrains me.

393
00:27:47,044 --> 00:27:48,574
No one understands.

394
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,032
Never leave me.

395
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:36,210
Sister?

396
00:28:40,495 --> 00:28:43,021
I couldn't sleep. I'm sorry.

397
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,875
Why could you not sleep?

398
00:28:46,455 --> 00:28:47,930
I was thinking of her!

399
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,091
Who? Thinking of who?

400
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,448
The Lady Mary, of course.

401
00:28:57,491 --> 00:28:58,742
And her mother!

402
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,024
Katherine.

403
00:29:02,465 --> 00:29:05,260
Yes. Katherine!
What's wrong with you?

404
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,288
I don't understand.

405
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:12,219
- What harm can they do you now?
- Every harm!

406
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,038
As long as Mary is alive,

407
00:29:15,655 --> 00:29:17,853
- then she could be Queen.
- No.

408
00:29:20,489 --> 00:29:23,175
The Act of Succession
makes it impossible.

409
00:29:23,335 --> 00:29:24,516
Elizabeth,

410
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,816
your daughter

411
00:29:26,976 --> 00:29:29,055
will be made heir to the throne.

412
00:29:29,215 --> 00:29:31,496
But the King can change his mind!

413
00:29:32,183 --> 00:29:34,540
He can do whatever he wills now.

414
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,126
He has absolute power. You know that!

415
00:29:40,918 --> 00:29:44,005
And what he has given,
he can take away,

416
00:29:44,306 --> 00:29:47,301
and what taken away, he can give back.

417
00:29:47,582 --> 00:29:50,727
And he could still make Mary Queen,

418
00:29:50,887 --> 00:29:53,338
even above my daughter.

419
00:29:55,955 --> 00:29:57,528
But why should he?

420
00:29:58,336 --> 00:30:00,702
I don't know. I just fear it.

421
00:30:08,881 --> 00:30:10,684
This is all I know of Mary,

422
00:30:13,372 --> 00:30:15,287
that she is my death,

423
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,818
and I am hers!

424
00:30:21,756 --> 00:30:23,568
Benedicant te, Domine,

425
00:30:23,934 --> 00:30:25,925
omnes angeli et santi tui.

426
00:30:26,874 --> 00:30:29,193
Benedicant te caeli, terra, mare,

427
00:30:29,353 --> 00:30:31,232
et omnia quae in eis sunt.

428
00:30:31,392 --> 00:30:33,251
In te speravi, Domine.

429
00:30:33,993 --> 00:30:35,401
Tu es Deus meus,

430
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:36,779
- Thomas!
- In...

431
00:30:37,556 --> 00:30:39,217
- Sir Thomas!
- John...

432
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:43,822
Is that you, John?

433
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:46,788
My master, Cardinal Fisher,
is found guilty

434
00:30:46,948 --> 00:30:48,641
and is called forth tomorrow.

435
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,730
He hopes you and he shall soon
meet in heaven.

436
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,350
Tell him that will be the way,

437
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:58,083
for it is a very strait gate we are in.

438
00:30:58,679 --> 00:30:59,665
John...

439
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,242
tell him

440
00:31:04,482 --> 00:31:06,303
he deserves and will receive

441
00:31:06,937 --> 00:31:08,599
all of heaven's graces.

442
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:09,800
Yes, Sir.

443
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,632
God bless you, Sir.

444
00:31:27,045 --> 00:31:28,322
God bless you.

445
00:31:32,161 --> 00:31:35,306
In nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti.

446
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,635
You see that I am wearing
my finest clothes,

447
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,983
for today is my wedding day!

448
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,292
Good people, I ask you to

449
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:52,373
love the King and obey him,

450
00:31:52,613 --> 00:31:54,307
for he is good by nature...

451
00:31:54,893 --> 00:31:58,161
even if he is not right
in his religious policies.

452
00:31:59,796 --> 00:32:02,003
But I am condemned to die

453
00:32:02,428 --> 00:32:06,061
for wishing to uphold the honor of God
and the Holy See.

454
00:32:08,942 --> 00:32:10,181
And now,

455
00:32:10,341 --> 00:32:13,681
good Christian people,
I ask for your prayers.

456
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:17,712
I am only flesh,
and fear death as much as any man.

457
00:32:19,728 --> 00:32:23,346
It's true that I have
long since made up my mind to die,

458
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:26,348
if need be,
for Christ and His Church, but...

459
00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:30,196
now that the moment is at hand,

460
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:36,648
I need your help.

461
00:32:37,785 --> 00:32:40,338
God bless you, Cardinal Fisher.

462
00:33:41,138 --> 00:33:44,110
- Holy Father!
- Do you know who that was?

463
00:33:46,434 --> 00:33:49,091
Michelagniolo di Ludovico

464
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:52,471
di Lionardo di Buonnarroti Simoni.

465
00:33:53,673 --> 00:33:55,128
Michelangelo?

466
00:33:55,288 --> 00:33:57,222
- That was him?
- That was him.

467
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:00,343
We forgive him because he is a genius.

468
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:03,235
Whatever that means.

469
00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:05,658
Holiness, we have heard from England

470
00:34:05,818 --> 00:34:07,918
of the murder of Cardinal Fisher.

471
00:34:08,078 --> 00:34:11,232
His head was struck
from his body with an axe.

472
00:34:11,392 --> 00:34:14,182
I have already heard. It is an outrage.

473
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:16,763
I had made Fisher
a Prince of the Church...

474
00:34:16,923 --> 00:34:19,045
but it mattered nothing to King Henry,

475
00:34:19,205 --> 00:34:22,680
who is now so mired in vice and lust

476
00:34:23,084 --> 00:34:25,121
that he is beyond reason.

477
00:34:26,684 --> 00:34:28,036
Magnificent!

478
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,074
Majesty, now that Fisher is dead,

479
00:34:37,506 --> 00:34:39,591
what is to be done about More?

480
00:34:48,575 --> 00:34:50,509
We should press ahead, Mr. Cromwell.

481
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:53,016
We should press ahead.

482
00:35:04,647 --> 00:35:06,317
Father, what has happened here?

483
00:35:06,557 --> 00:35:09,404
It seems to me that they are
treating you worse than before.

484
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:13,599
Well, they've taken my stove,

485
00:35:14,603 --> 00:35:15,956
some clothing.

486
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,011
My food is reduced.

487
00:35:20,171 --> 00:35:22,109
- Father how can you...
- Margaret...

488
00:35:24,886 --> 00:35:26,858
you must not be concerned about me.

489
00:35:29,975 --> 00:35:32,707
I've thought long and hard

490
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:35,608
about Christ's passion and pain and...

491
00:35:38,979 --> 00:35:40,768
I am not afraid of death.

492
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,199
I am only afraid of torture.

493
00:35:46,115 --> 00:35:49,139
If they use violent ways
to make me swear,

494
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,878
I don't know how brave I would be.

495
00:35:53,198 --> 00:35:56,418
But you do not have to suffer anything.

496
00:35:57,192 --> 00:35:59,474
Just take the oath...

497
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,474
like I did.

498
00:36:01,818 --> 00:36:03,677
Like everyone has done.

499
00:36:03,837 --> 00:36:07,235
Just say it and
your body will be saved.

500
00:36:07,395 --> 00:36:10,498
But the saving of my body,
will be at the expense of my soul.

501
00:36:10,658 --> 00:36:12,425
- No!
- Yes.

502
00:36:12,665 --> 00:36:15,716
No. None of us believes that.

503
00:36:28,652 --> 00:36:29,942
Father, please.

504
00:36:30,784 --> 00:36:31,920
Please...

505
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:36,503
For the love I know you bear us,

506
00:36:37,385 --> 00:36:39,235
don't do this to us.

507
00:36:44,868 --> 00:36:46,163
Mr. Secretary...

508
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:49,168
Sir Richard Rich.

509
00:36:51,704 --> 00:36:53,049
Sir Richard...

510
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,509
I'm very pleased to see you.

511
00:36:56,373 --> 00:36:59,901
I have a job for you.

512
00:37:18,221 --> 00:37:19,104
Why?

513
00:37:20,951 --> 00:37:23,411
Why can he not be as others?

514
00:37:23,974 --> 00:37:25,646
Why does he have to cross me?

515
00:37:25,806 --> 00:37:28,630
Why can his vanity
be greater than a King's?

516
00:37:30,692 --> 00:37:32,421
It troubles me.

517
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:36,896
It ways on my conscience
and my heart is full and heavy and sore.

518
00:37:38,872 --> 00:37:42,694
I say this only to you.
I confess only to you.

519
00:37:42,854 --> 00:37:44,396
I love him.

520
00:37:45,748 --> 00:37:47,204
And I hate him.

521
00:37:47,722 --> 00:37:50,069
I hate in equal measure to my love,

522
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:52,191
for he is the spirit that denies.

523
00:37:53,933 --> 00:37:57,648
It is up to you to judge,
whether or not he be on my conscience!

524
00:38:04,401 --> 00:38:05,562
Sir Richard.

525
00:38:06,737 --> 00:38:07,917
Good day to you.

526
00:38:09,128 --> 00:38:12,670
I see my cell is fast becoming
the place for lawyers to meet.

527
00:38:14,337 --> 00:38:16,902
I am afraid, Thomas,
that I come here most unwillingly

528
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:19,712
for I am ordered
to deprive you of all your

529
00:38:19,993 --> 00:38:22,263
books and papers... and suchlike.

530
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,387
That is a pity.

531
00:38:30,457 --> 00:38:33,499
Still, if you are ordered to, I suppose,

532
00:38:35,015 --> 00:38:37,070
then I suppose there is no other way.

533
00:38:41,406 --> 00:38:43,265
You had best get started.

534
00:39:05,796 --> 00:39:07,615
May I ask you a question, Thomas?

535
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:09,977
Only if it's a hypothetical one,
Richard.

536
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:12,306
It's better that way.

537
00:39:12,568 --> 00:39:14,893
Suppose, then, that...

538
00:39:15,307 --> 00:39:17,119
Parliament enacted a bill

539
00:39:17,279 --> 00:39:19,344
to say that I, Richard Rich, was King,

540
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,565
and that it would be
treason to deny it...

541
00:39:23,006 --> 00:39:24,828
would you accept me as King?

542
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:25,788
Yes.

543
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:31,978
But let me counter with
another hypothetical case.

544
00:39:32,138 --> 00:39:34,410
Suppose Parliament enacted that

545
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,682
God was not God,

546
00:39:38,213 --> 00:39:40,616
and to oppose the act would be treason,

547
00:39:41,367 --> 00:39:44,598
would you say that God was not God?

548
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:48,173
No. Since no Parliament
can make any such law.

549
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:51,558
It has no competence to decide
on the existence of God.

550
00:39:52,176 --> 00:39:56,013
And no more can Parliament make the King
Supreme Head of the Church.

551
00:40:01,304 --> 00:40:02,713
There, Thomas.

552
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,792
I think my work here is done.

553
00:40:23,216 --> 00:40:24,464
Your Majesty,

554
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:26,849
the King is here.

555
00:40:36,209 --> 00:40:37,721
My Lady.

556
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:50,690
Come here.

557
00:40:57,772 --> 00:40:59,879
Do you still have a passion for me?

558
00:41:01,087 --> 00:41:02,608
I do, sweetheart.

559
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:04,939
I love you.

560
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:10,096
There now.

561
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,801
Don't weep.

562
00:41:14,031 --> 00:41:15,965
Don't weep, my own darling.

563
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:19,140
It's all right.

564
00:41:20,257 --> 00:41:22,736
Everything is going to be all right.

565
00:42:10,481 --> 00:42:13,840
Sir Thomas More, you are arraigned
before this commission

566
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,497
on charges of high treason.

567
00:42:17,025 --> 00:42:18,874
How do you answer the charges?

568
00:42:23,578 --> 00:42:26,583
Let me begin by denying

569
00:42:26,743 --> 00:42:30,094
that I ever maliciously opposed
the King's marriage to Anne Boleyn.

570
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:33,722
I have never spoken
maliciously against it...

571
00:42:34,689 --> 00:42:36,475
but only sometimes according to my

572
00:42:36,715 --> 00:42:37,810
mind,

573
00:42:38,486 --> 00:42:40,524
opinion and my conscience.

574
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,396
And have suffered as a result.

575
00:42:45,447 --> 00:42:48,821
But you have maliciously denied
the Act of Supremacy.

576
00:42:49,434 --> 00:42:51,190
No. I have been silent upon it.

577
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:55,880
And for all my taciturnity neither
your law nor any law in the world

578
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,615
is able, justly and rightly,
to condemn me,

579
00:42:59,524 --> 00:43:02,256
unless you may also lay to my charge
either some

580
00:43:03,228 --> 00:43:04,834
word or some deed.

581
00:43:04,994 --> 00:43:08,382
Your silence can easily
be construed as an action.

582
00:43:09,092 --> 00:43:10,606
But even in that case,

583
00:43:10,766 --> 00:43:12,900
the presumption
that silence gives consent

584
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,984
precludes the charge against me.

585
00:43:15,144 --> 00:43:17,303
"Qui tacet, consentire videtur."

586
00:43:22,823 --> 00:43:26,484
What of the charge that you conspired
in prison with Bishop Fisher,

587
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:28,739
a convicted traitor?

588
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:31,614
I never met him in prison.

589
00:43:31,854 --> 00:43:34,658
I only talked a little with his servant

590
00:43:35,172 --> 00:43:36,928
about familiar things

591
00:43:38,139 --> 00:43:40,853
and recommendations,

592
00:43:41,013 --> 00:43:43,412
such as were seemly
to our long acquaintance.

593
00:43:51,782 --> 00:43:53,876
We go back to your supposed

594
00:43:54,036 --> 00:43:56,242
silence on the Act of Supremacy.

595
00:43:56,402 --> 00:43:59,620
We think you have in fact
spoken about it.

596
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,484
And we have a witness.

597
00:44:01,644 --> 00:44:03,333
Call the solicitor general.

598
00:44:03,493 --> 00:44:06,124
<i>Call, Mr. Richard Rich!</i>

599
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:27,272
Richard, you are under oath.

600
00:44:27,785 --> 00:44:30,468
Do you tell this commission, truthfully,
what the accused

601
00:44:30,628 --> 00:44:32,243
said to you on this matter.

602
00:44:32,676 --> 00:44:33,551
Yes, Sirs.

603
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,857
We agreed
that Parliement might not make

604
00:44:37,017 --> 00:44:39,390
any such law that God was not God

605
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:41,656
To which Sir Thomas said:

606
00:44:42,589 --> 00:44:46,175
"No more can Parliament make the King
Supreme Head of the Church."

607
00:44:47,387 --> 00:44:50,401
So he maliciously denied
the King's authority?

608
00:44:50,777 --> 00:44:52,392
In those words?

609
00:44:52,552 --> 00:44:53,509
Yes, Sir.

610
00:44:54,485 --> 00:44:56,091
In those exact words.

611
00:45:08,259 --> 00:45:11,422
Then I will charge this commission

612
00:45:11,662 --> 00:45:13,115
to return a true verdict.

613
00:45:13,455 --> 00:45:15,718
I ask you, good Sirs,
to determine whether

614
00:45:15,878 --> 00:45:19,005
Sir Thomas More did converse
with Sir Richard Rich

615
00:45:19,165 --> 00:45:21,102
in the manner alleged?

616
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,852
You do so find him guilty?

617
00:45:31,735 --> 00:45:35,070
Then I will proceed in judgement
against the prisoner.

618
00:45:35,537 --> 00:45:36,664
My Lord,

619
00:45:38,934 --> 00:45:41,601
when I was a lawyer,
the convention was to ask

620
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:43,988
the prisoner before judgement was given,

621
00:45:44,148 --> 00:45:46,582
why judgement should not
be given against him.

622
00:45:48,811 --> 00:45:51,629
What then are you able
to say to the contrary?

623
00:45:52,514 --> 00:45:53,589
Thank you.

624
00:45:57,916 --> 00:45:59,122
To my view,

625
00:46:00,748 --> 00:46:02,551
this indictment is

626
00:46:03,002 --> 00:46:05,134
grounded upon an act of Parliament

627
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:08,129
directly repugnant to the laws of God

628
00:46:08,289 --> 00:46:09,897
and His Holy Church.

629
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:12,983
The supreme governance of which

630
00:46:13,223 --> 00:46:15,835
no temporal Prince may presume

631
00:46:15,995 --> 00:46:18,322
by any law to take unto himself.

632
00:46:19,636 --> 00:46:22,012
It belongs... It belongs

633
00:46:22,172 --> 00:46:24,766
by right to the See of Rome,

634
00:46:24,926 --> 00:46:27,301
to St Peter and his successors...

635
00:46:27,461 --> 00:46:30,626
as our Saviour told us Himself
when He was on earth.

636
00:46:32,614 --> 00:46:33,712
This realm,

637
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,140
being but one small part of the Church,

638
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:40,057
cannot make any particular law

639
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:42,198
disagreeable to the general laws

640
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:45,265
of Christ's universal Catholic Church.

641
00:46:45,707 --> 00:46:46,918
No more...

642
00:46:48,364 --> 00:46:50,354
No more can this realm of England

643
00:46:50,594 --> 00:46:52,179
refuse obedience to Rome

644
00:46:52,339 --> 00:46:56,229
than can a child refuse obedience
to his own natural father!

645
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,409
We now plainly see
that you are maliciously bent.

646
00:47:03,649 --> 00:47:05,908
No, Sirs. Not maliciously.

647
00:47:06,956 --> 00:47:10,258
I hope we may all meet
merrily in heaven hereafter.

648
00:47:11,015 --> 00:47:12,613
And I desire Almighty God

649
00:47:12,773 --> 00:47:15,254
to preserve and defend
the King's Majesty,

650
00:47:16,498 --> 00:47:17,907
and to send him

651
00:47:18,921 --> 00:47:20,526
good counsel.

652
00:47:22,769 --> 00:47:24,393
Sir Thomas More,

653
00:47:24,954 --> 00:47:26,890
you are to be drawn on a hurdle

654
00:47:27,883 --> 00:47:29,996
through the City of London to Tyburn,

655
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:34,043
there to be hanged
till you be half dead,

656
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,437
after that

657
00:47:36,951 --> 00:47:38,707
cut down alive,

658
00:47:39,027 --> 00:47:42,596
your bowels to be taken out of your body
and burned before you,

659
00:47:43,366 --> 00:47:45,328
your privy parts cut off,

660
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,063
your head cut off,

661
00:47:49,279 --> 00:47:51,915
your body to be divided
in four parts...

662
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:02,999
Bless us, father.

663
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:05,012
I bless you, my children.

664
00:48:05,252 --> 00:48:07,080
Be of good cheer,

665
00:48:07,516 --> 00:48:10,220
for I pray that
we will meet together in heaven!

666
00:48:26,139 --> 00:48:27,754
When is the execution?

667
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:29,905
Tomorrow, Your Majesty.

668
00:48:33,798 --> 00:48:35,263
What date is that?

669
00:48:37,028 --> 00:48:39,206
The 6th of July.

670
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:45,677
What time?

671
00:48:46,974 --> 00:48:48,974
At ten in the morning.

672
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,447
I have decided to commute
the sentence to beheading.

673
00:49:29,903 --> 00:49:31,339
Tell the officials.

674
00:49:33,848 --> 00:49:35,538
Yes, Your Majesty.

675
00:49:55,071 --> 00:49:57,671
Pietate tua, quaessumus Domine,

676
00:49:58,347 --> 00:50:01,079
nostrorum solve vincula peccatorum,

677
00:50:02,554 --> 00:50:06,069
et intercedente
beata Maria semper virgine.

678
00:50:07,124 --> 00:50:08,827
Nos famulos tuos

679
00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:11,571
in omni sanctitate custodi.

680
00:50:13,942 --> 00:50:15,491
Per Christum

681
00:50:15,895 --> 00:50:17,567
Dominum nostrum.

682
00:51:09,538 --> 00:51:10,937
Thank you, Sir Humphrey.

683
00:51:12,564 --> 00:51:14,613
But when I come down again,

684
00:51:15,214 --> 00:51:17,946
let me shift for myself,
as well as I can.

685
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:44,147
I ask you to bear witness with me

686
00:51:44,595 --> 00:51:47,233
that I shall now suffer death in

687
00:51:48,244 --> 00:51:51,697
and for the faith
of the Holy Catholic Church.

688
00:51:57,229 --> 00:51:59,041
I beg you earnestly

689
00:51:59,773 --> 00:52:01,369
to pray for the King,

690
00:52:02,017 --> 00:52:03,350
and tell him

691
00:52:04,542 --> 00:52:06,712
I died his good servant

692
00:52:08,238 --> 00:52:09,798
but God's first.

693
00:52:15,078 --> 00:52:17,013
I ask for your pardon and blessing.

694
00:52:20,373 --> 00:52:23,263
You will give me this day
a greater benefit than any mortal man

695
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,303
can ever be able to give me.

696
00:52:27,729 --> 00:52:29,526
Pluck up your spirits, man,

697
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,321
and be not afraid to do your office.

698
00:52:52,474 --> 00:52:54,211
Miserere miti Domime,

699
00:52:55,674 --> 00:52:58,050
secundum miseration un tuum.
