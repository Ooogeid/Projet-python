1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,214
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:01,454 --> 00:00:03,970
The annulment of my marriage
must be declared immediately.

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,980
The King of England asks your approval

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,096
to appoint an Archbishop of Canterbury.

5
00:00:08,336 --> 00:00:11,623
- What is the name of the candidate?
- Thomas Cranmer, a nobody.

6
00:00:11,743 --> 00:00:14,489
What harm can a nobody inflict

7
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:16,560
on our Holy Church?

8
00:00:16,846 --> 00:00:19,516
That the union between
King Henry of England

9
00:00:19,636 --> 00:00:23,153
and Katherine of Aragon
is declared null and void.

10
00:00:23,393 --> 00:00:25,738
Regal supremacy over our Holy Church

11
00:00:25,979 --> 00:00:28,116
would represent a tearing asunder

12
00:00:28,356 --> 00:00:30,373
of the seamless coat of Christ.

13
00:00:30,493 --> 00:00:32,912
There are rumours that
the King has married Anne

14
00:00:33,152 --> 00:00:34,789
<i>and that she's already with child.</i>

15
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:37,803
<i>I want the people to love
their new Queen. And if I can love her,</i>

16
00:00:37,923 --> 00:00:39,085
<i>why shouldn't they?</i>

17
00:00:39,325 --> 00:00:41,366
<i>If you succeed
in killing the King's whore,</i>

18
00:00:41,486 --> 00:00:45,216
<i>you will be the beloved of God,
and of the faithful people of England.</i>

19
00:00:45,456 --> 00:00:48,502
- Unfortunately, Holy Father, I failed.
- Who knows, my son?

20
00:00:48,622 --> 00:00:50,971
God works in mysterious ways.

21
00:00:51,212 --> 00:00:54,234
I come to offer my resignation
from my post as Chancellor.

22
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,180
I can't. Not now, while the baby...

23
00:00:57,698 --> 00:00:59,356
<i>Exquisite, isn't she?</i>

24
00:00:59,596 --> 00:01:02,192
Lady Eleanor Luke.
Shall I talk to her on your behalf?

25
00:01:02,432 --> 00:01:05,768
<i>I fear for the Queen. Anne Boleyn
hates her. And her daughter, too.</i>

26
00:01:05,888 --> 00:01:09,157
Your mother must now accept
the title of Dowager Princess,

27
00:01:09,397 --> 00:01:11,826
just as you have no right
to call yourself Princess.

28
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:15,455
<i>You are forbidden to communicate
with your mother from this day forward.</i>

29
00:01:15,695 --> 00:01:18,834
The Pope threatens to excommunicate me
if I do not return to Katherine.

30
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,336
He's too late.

31
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:22,796
I want you to organise jousts,
banquets and masques

32
00:01:23,036 --> 00:01:24,798
<i>to celebrate the birth of my son.</i>

33
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:28,528
Your Majesty has given birth
to a very healthy baby girl.

34
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:31,520
I'm so sorry.

Abrenuntias satanae
(Do you renounce Satan)

41
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,110
Abrenuntio.
(I do renounce him.)

42
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:21,426
Ego te baptizo,
(I baptize you)

43
00:03:22,337 --> 00:03:24,712
in nomine Patris
(in the name of the Father, )

44
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:27,404
et Filii,
(and of the Son)

45
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:29,756
et Spiritus Sancti.
(and of the Holy Spirit)

46
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,424
Vade in pace,
(Go in peace)

47
00:03:40,865 --> 00:03:43,673
et Dominus vobiscum.
(and the Lord be with you.)

48
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,810
Amen.

49
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:58,201
God, of infinite goodness,

50
00:03:58,441 --> 00:04:01,162
send prosperous life and long

51
00:04:01,547 --> 00:04:05,040
to the high and mighty
Princess of England,

52
00:04:05,282 --> 00:04:06,646
Elizabeth!

53
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,286
<i>There can be no question
of illegitimacy.</i>

54
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:39,643
You will prepare a bill
to put before Parliament.

55
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:41,730
It will state that the succession

56
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,980
is now firmly vested in our children...

57
00:04:44,422 --> 00:04:45,707
and no others.

58
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,980
I shall do as Your Majesty commands.

59
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:53,240
I am mindful, Mr. Cromwell,
that there are some people

60
00:04:53,783 --> 00:04:56,895
some wrong-headed, some biased people

61
00:04:57,684 --> 00:05:00,805
who are still unwilling
to accept the validity of my marriage.

62
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:04,356
In view of that, I think...

63
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,440
some sanction
should be made against them.

64
00:05:08,603 --> 00:05:10,950
Everyone will be given their opportunity

65
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,910
to demonstrate their loyalty.

66
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:21,028
I am told that the Lady
is much dismayed

67
00:05:21,148 --> 00:05:23,490
at having given birth to a daughter 

68
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,463
and not the son she promised.

69
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,581
To my mind, it is sure proof

70
00:05:27,823 --> 00:05:29,636
that God has abandoned her.

71
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:33,750
How is my mother, the Queen?

72
00:05:34,372 --> 00:05:36,982
Alas, I cannot visit or speak to her.

73
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:40,813
I have little communications
with her ladies,

74
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:43,513
and they tell me she is still strong...

75
00:05:43,754 --> 00:05:46,554
but always begs the King, your father,

76
00:05:46,674 --> 00:05:49,190
of his mercy, to be allowed to see you.

77
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,316
I am sure His Majesty
will one day relent,

78
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:55,018
for I think...

79
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:58,557
I believe with all my heart

80
00:05:58,677 --> 00:06:00,566
that he still loves and cares for me.

81
00:06:03,326 --> 00:06:05,016
I am sure that he does.

82
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:11,734
Bishop Tunstall.

83
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:13,600
Sir Thomas.

84
00:06:17,717 --> 00:06:18,806
Thank you.

85
00:06:23,212 --> 00:06:25,181
To what do I owe this honour?

86
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:29,022
We have known each other
a long time, Sir Thomas.

87
00:06:29,496 --> 00:06:32,729
But now you have retired
from public life

88
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,149
and I never see you.

89
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:38,403
Naturally I was concerned
about your welfare.

90
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:40,303
I am very well, thank you.

91
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:44,411
But I am...

92
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:47,886
I am exorcised by the fact

93
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:50,915
that one of our old acquaintances
is still under house arrest.

94
00:06:51,155 --> 00:06:52,511
You mean Bishop Fisher?

95
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:57,026
Yes, the outcome is regrettable.

96
00:06:57,858 --> 00:06:59,507
The "outcome" of what?

97
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,967
His intransigence.

98
00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:05,039
I see.

99
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,016
Tell me,

100
00:07:08,256 --> 00:07:10,230
has the King sent you here to see me?

101
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,186
His Majesty wondered

102
00:07:15,717 --> 00:07:18,763
why you did not attend
the Queen's Coronation,

103
00:07:18,883 --> 00:07:20,582
as you were invited to do.

104
00:07:20,702 --> 00:07:21,680
Well...

105
00:07:21,964 --> 00:07:24,152
in answer to that, let me...

106
00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:27,120
let me show my poor mind to you.

107
00:07:29,113 --> 00:07:31,892
There's a story
about the Emperor Tiberius.

108
00:07:33,815 --> 00:07:36,712
He had enacted a law which exacted death

109
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:40,172
for a certain crime... unless
the offender was a virgin.

110
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,464
Now, when a virgin eventually
appeared on the charge,

111
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,180
the Emperor didn't know exactly
how to proceed,

112
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,650
so one of his council
proposed the perfect solution:

113
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,685
Let her first be deflowered,

114
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:54,670
so she then can be

115
00:07:55,356 --> 00:07:56,379
... devoured.

116
00:07:58,232 --> 00:07:59,443
There are some...

117
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,070
and no, I won't name them...

118
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:05,106
who first procure you
for the coronation,

119
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:08,493
next to preach at it,
and then to write books defending it.

120
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,452
Thus they deflower you,

121
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,075
and will not fail soon afterwards to

122
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:14,784
... devour you.

123
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:20,830
But they shall never deflower me.

124
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:55,115
That was beautiful.

125
00:09:03,221 --> 00:09:04,301
Do you play?

126
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,029
All the time.

127
00:09:26,978 --> 00:09:28,743
- Majesty.
- Lady Eleanor.

128
00:10:00,598 --> 00:10:01,659
Never mind.

129
00:10:02,194 --> 00:10:03,612
More like this. Watch.

130
00:10:04,989 --> 00:10:06,125
Fingers like so.

131
00:10:06,632 --> 00:10:08,106
Don't squeeze the arrow.

132
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:10,690
Draw...

133
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,022
and release.

134
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:16,941
I'll never do that.

135
00:10:17,795 --> 00:10:18,866
Yes, you will.

136
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,014
Your Grace. I have it.

137
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:25,101
- Mr. Secretary.
- Your Grace.

138
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,897
- And your son?
- Yes.

139
00:10:30,017 --> 00:10:32,592
I'm teaching him to sport
before I get too old for it.

140
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:36,474
- Do you shoot, Cromwell?
- Sometimes, Your Grace.

141
00:10:45,796 --> 00:10:46,901
My Lord.

142
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:03,281
Shall we walk?

143
00:11:05,793 --> 00:11:07,220
What does the King want?

144
00:11:08,215 --> 00:11:10,713
His Majesty would like
to see you back at court.

145
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,914
With your wife.

146
00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:14,219
He misses Your Grace's company.

147
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:15,261
And?

148
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,970
His Majesty is aware
that you favour the Imperialist cause

149
00:11:21,237 --> 00:11:23,265
you say so openly in Council

150
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:27,328
and have, perhaps, a great sympathy
for the Dowager Princess?

151
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:28,661
 Don't you?

152
00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:30,957
Actually, I do.

153
00:11:32,504 --> 00:11:33,978
I'm not heartless,

154
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,057
whatever some people think.

155
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,852
Quite the contrary.

156
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,735
But I serve the King.

157
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:46,159
His Majesty intends
to vest the succession

158
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:48,831
with the children he will have
with Queen Anne.

159
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:52,702
A bill will go before Parliament.

160
00:11:54,284 --> 00:11:56,481
He wants to know
if he'll have your support.

161
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:08,857
Hungry?

162
00:12:20,486 --> 00:12:21,805
What are you doing?

163
00:12:22,193 --> 00:12:24,007
Your Majesty.

164
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:26,542
May I not feed her from my own breast?

165
00:12:27,861 --> 00:12:29,336
Queens don't do that...

166
00:12:29,704 --> 00:12:31,441
especially not for a daughter.

167
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:34,116
Give her back to her wet-nurse.

168
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,786
The Princess will shortly be given
her own establishment at Hatfield.

169
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,643
Among others, the Lady Mary
will attend and wait on her.

170
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:56,405
Katherine's daughter?

171
00:12:57,459 --> 00:12:58,445
Yes.

172
00:12:59,074 --> 00:13:01,139
It is well that she knows her new place.

173
00:13:03,276 --> 00:13:05,088
Secretary Cromwell is arranging it.

174
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:11,900
I will still give you a son.

175
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:17,971
Come soon, my darling,

176
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:20,115
to my hot bed.

177
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,681
- Ladies.
- Majesty.

178
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:38,197
<i>Alice, children...</i>

179
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,160
My dear family,
I have something to say to you.

180
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,039
My income is now
so greatly reduced, that...

181
00:13:49,778 --> 00:13:52,600
that we can no longer go on living
as we are accustomed.

182
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,589
I am no longer the recipient
of the King's bounty.

183
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:58,850
And so,

184
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,316
I must live frugally

185
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,019
and... reduce my household.

186
00:14:06,869 --> 00:14:09,964
Those of you who can must
live in your own houses

187
00:14:10,302 --> 00:14:11,877
and eat at your own tables.

188
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:15,151
- But, Father...
- No. Come on.

189
00:14:17,308 --> 00:14:19,186
Things inevitably must change.

190
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,508
You can't all be supported forever.

191
00:14:23,258 --> 00:14:25,080
Life is not like that.

192
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,414
Real life is raw

193
00:14:29,945 --> 00:14:31,213
and difficult.

194
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:33,911
And you must face up to that fact.

195
00:14:35,393 --> 00:14:37,168
If not to even worse things.

196
00:14:39,115 --> 00:14:40,814
Come on. Let us eat.

197
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:49,810
Give me a little wine, please.

198
00:14:50,134 --> 00:14:51,420
Yes, mother.

199
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,601
The Lady Mary, Lady Bryan.

200
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:09,821
Lady Mary.

201
00:15:10,915 --> 00:15:13,460
Welcome to Hatfield, your new home.

202
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:17,000
I am Lady Margaret Bryan,
the Princess's Governess.

203
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,693
These other Ladies, are also here
to attend the Princess.

204
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,434
Lady Mary, may I present you

205
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:25,910
to her Highness the Princess Elizabeth.

206
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,280
You will be shown to your room.

207
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,226
You will begin your duties
in the mornings, after prayers.

208
00:15:37,172 --> 00:15:38,815
I shall say my prayers alone.

209
00:15:41,088 --> 00:15:42,787
sThis is your room, my Lady.

210
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:51,533
Christmas.

211
00:16:53,358 --> 00:16:56,701
Why is it that as you get older,
it always seems to be Christmas?

212
00:16:57,252 --> 00:17:00,240
Of course, it is always
Christmas for you, isn't it, my Lord?

213
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,069
A Baron in your own right now,
and some new titles.

214
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,449
Remind me.

215
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,533
Master of Buckhounds.

216
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,937
Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.

217
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,193
Was there not another one?

218
00:17:11,694 --> 00:17:14,445
Master of the Bedlam Hospital
for the insane?

219
00:17:15,214 --> 00:17:16,050
Yes.

220
00:17:17,586 --> 00:17:19,173
Do you plan to visit it?

221
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,920
I don't mean as an inmate.

222
00:17:24,431 --> 00:17:27,277
I read one of your satires
about life here at court.

223
00:17:27,707 --> 00:17:29,043
If I were you,

224
00:17:29,163 --> 00:17:32,598
I'd be more careful about poking fun
at those who have the power to hurt you.

225
00:17:34,696 --> 00:17:36,264
That's just friendly advice.

226
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,073
Here, my love.

227
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:57,332
I have a gift for you.

228
00:18:02,408 --> 00:18:04,042
It's fantastic!

229
00:18:04,502 --> 00:18:05,976
Who made this?

230
00:18:06,096 --> 00:18:07,414
Master Holbein.

231
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,092
The man's a genius.

232
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:13,728
As are you,

233
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:15,287
my beautiful Queen.

234
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,130
Happy Christmas.

235
00:18:25,052 --> 00:18:26,320
I could still do it.

236
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:30,389
- I could find a way to poison her.
- No!

237
00:18:31,065 --> 00:18:34,435
- But I thought that was...
- It would be blamed on my master.

238
00:18:35,393 --> 00:18:37,246
At the moment, he doesn't need that.

239
00:18:37,728 --> 00:18:39,622
He has a war with the Turks
to contend with.

240
00:18:39,863 --> 00:18:42,793
- But why should anyone ever know?
- Don't be stupid, Brereton.

241
00:18:43,564 --> 00:18:45,421
They would find you and torture you,

242
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:49,050
- and you would tell them everything.
- No, I wouldn't.

243
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:51,180
I'd die a martyr's death.

244
00:18:53,046 --> 00:18:55,731
You've never seen a man being tortured.

245
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,776
Now do you understand?

246
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,919
You don't act alone.

247
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:12,993
Charles.

248
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:17,944
- Happy Christmas.
- And to Your Majesty.

249
00:19:18,443 --> 00:19:21,440
- I have a gift for you.
- Where is it?

250
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,978
You'll have to wait
the new session of Parliament.

251
00:19:24,612 --> 00:19:26,058
For it's my vote.

252
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:30,092
How could I have ever doubted you?

253
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,654
Eleanor Luke.

254
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:52,001
You see the way the King looks at her?

255
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,458
She's his mistress.

256
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,615
Get rid of her.

257
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:07,350
Mary. Majesty.

258
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,048
We must find you a new husband.

259
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:19,053
I have another gift for you.

260
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,624
I am with child again.

261
00:20:43,164 --> 00:20:44,723
<i>Majesty, Councillors...</i>

262
00:20:45,065 --> 00:20:47,870
here is the new Act,
the Act of Succession,

263
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,452
which I am commanded to present shortly
to the Houses of Parliament.

264
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:54,318
The Act nominates the children born

265
00:20:54,438 --> 00:20:58,053
of His Majesty and Queen Anne
as first rightful heirs.

266
00:20:58,293 --> 00:21:00,969
By so doing, it protects
the nation from the divisions

267
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:03,837
it has suffered in the past,
when several different titles

268
00:21:03,957 --> 00:21:05,732
have pretended to the throne.

269
00:21:06,907 --> 00:21:10,309
The Act warns
that anyone saying or writing

270
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:12,540
anything to the prejudice or slander

271
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,050
of the lawful matrimony between the King

272
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,360
and his most dear
and entirely beloved wife Queen Anne,

273
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,245
or against his heirs,

274
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:22,667
would be guilty of high treason,

275
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,371
for which the penalty is death,

276
00:21:26,223 --> 00:21:29,030
and forfeiture of goods to the Crown.

277
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:33,463
<i>"The new Act requires
all the King's subjects,</i>

278
00:21:33,703 --> 00:21:35,934
"if so commanded, to swear an oath

279
00:21:37,103 --> 00:21:40,374
"that they shall truly, firmly,
constantly, without fraud and guile,

280
00:21:40,494 --> 00:21:43,190
"observe, fulfil, maintain,
defend and keep

281
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,398
"the whole contents
and effect of the Bill."

282
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,130
This oath will also require recognition

283
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,774
of the King's supremacy in all matters,

284
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:54,989
spiritual and temporal.

285
00:21:55,595 --> 00:21:57,440
Those who refuse to take it...

286
00:21:57,978 --> 00:22:00,453
will be accounted guilty of treason

287
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,678
and sent to prison.

288
00:22:06,112 --> 00:22:08,177
That is all well done, Mr. Secretary.

289
00:22:09,793 --> 00:22:11,305
I am pleased.

290
00:22:13,253 --> 00:22:15,629
So it must be sworn by oath, after all.

291
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:21,578
God save us.

292
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,162
Et unam sanctam

293
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,843
catholicam

294
00:22:32,554 --> 00:22:35,220
et apostolicam ecclesian.

295
00:22:42,202 --> 00:22:44,785
In nomine Patris et Fillii

296
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,827
et Spiritu Sancti.

297
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:48,740
Amen.

298
00:22:51,312 --> 00:22:53,878
Does the King remain obdurate?

299
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,705
Yes, Holy Father.

300
00:22:56,077 --> 00:22:59,484
He refuses to listen to advice,
and he forces all true believers

301
00:22:59,604 --> 00:23:01,635
to perjure their immortal souls.

302
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,130
How so?

303
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,038
They must all swear an oath 

304
00:23:05,158 --> 00:23:07,581
that the King is head
of the English church.

305
00:23:07,701 --> 00:23:10,352
Those who refuse are put in prison.

306
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,656
Like our brother in Christ,
Bishop Fisher.

307
00:23:13,776 --> 00:23:15,072
Yes, Holy Father.

308
00:23:16,315 --> 00:23:17,902
This is unacceptable.

309
00:23:18,672 --> 00:23:20,870
The shepherd cannot stand idly by

310
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,740
while the wolf enters the fold

311
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,715
and threatens his flock.

312
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:30,489
I have decided
to make Fisher a Cardinal.

313
00:23:31,517 --> 00:23:33,714
You will send his hat to England.

314
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:36,730
Let's see if the King is still prepared

315
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,460
to prosecute and torture
a Prince of the Church.

316
00:24:07,884 --> 00:24:09,000
Mistress Bryan.

317
00:24:09,563 --> 00:24:11,460
A very good morning to you.

318
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,235
I'm on Progress.

319
00:24:13,726 --> 00:24:15,869
I've come to see my daughter.
How is she?

320
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:18,540
She is a credit to Your Majesty
in every way.

321
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,130
My Elizabeth.

322
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,110
Who knows, Mistress Bryan,

323
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:37,578
perhaps one day this little girl
will preside over empires.

324
00:24:43,187 --> 00:24:44,560
Please forgive me...

325
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:46,612
I don't have much time.

326
00:25:04,907 --> 00:25:05,950
Thank you

327
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,609
for all your care toward
our beloved Princess.

328
00:25:08,729 --> 00:25:09,889
Your Majesty.

329
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,691
Lady Eleanor.

330
00:26:03,702 --> 00:26:05,185
My Lord.

331
00:26:08,071 --> 00:26:10,670
How did you suppose
no one would find out your secret?

332
00:26:11,856 --> 00:26:14,279
- I...
- Your chamber was searched today.

333
00:26:15,026 --> 00:26:17,699
- My Lord...?
- The jewels were found. 

334
00:26:18,341 --> 00:26:20,137
You did not hide them well enough.

335
00:26:20,257 --> 00:26:22,684
- Jewels...? I don't...
- Her Majesty's jewels.

336
00:26:23,053 --> 00:26:24,424
The ones you stole.

337
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:28,175
- It's not true!
- And I say it is true.

338
00:26:28,873 --> 00:26:31,094
And if your crimes were ever reported,

339
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,521
who do you suppose would believe you?

340
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:36,775
After all,

341
00:26:37,282 --> 00:26:38,822
Lady Eleanor,

342
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:41,672
no one could accuse you
of being innocent...

343
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:43,428
could they?

344
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:48,768
What am I to do?

345
00:26:49,644 --> 00:26:51,071
Leave court.

346
00:26:51,831 --> 00:26:53,437
Go back to your family.

347
00:26:54,695 --> 00:26:56,188
See if they will have you.

348
00:27:39,464 --> 00:27:40,891
Cousin Madge!

349
00:27:41,652 --> 00:27:43,840
Lady Sheldon, what are you reading?

350
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,056
Nothing, my Lady.

351
00:27:46,325 --> 00:27:48,295
Just some... poetry.

352
00:27:48,915 --> 00:27:50,408
By Sir Thomas Wyatt.

353
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,328
Give it here.

354
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,600
You should not be wasting
your time on such trifles.

355
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,745
If you must read, when you are supposed
to be attending on me,

356
00:28:06,865 --> 00:28:08,849
then you should read that book!

357
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:11,290
You will learn
a great deal more from it,

358
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,530
perhaps even some wisdom.

359
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:15,488
Yes, Madam.

360
00:28:17,007 --> 00:28:18,883
Now go about your business.

361
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:33,067
The Earl of Wiltshire, Your Majesty.

362
00:28:36,776 --> 00:28:37,931
Papa.

363
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,296
Your Majesty.

364
00:28:43,095 --> 00:28:44,644
You look well.

365
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,560
And I believe you're already showing.

366
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:49,197
A little.

367
00:28:50,286 --> 00:28:52,109
How was your trip to Paris?

368
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:54,169
It was...

369
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:57,137
King Francis is not
the easiest man to deal with.

370
00:28:57,662 --> 00:28:59,560
He sends you wedding presents,

371
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,128
but he can't officially
recognize you as Queen.

372
00:29:02,248 --> 00:29:04,445
As long as Katherine remains alive.

373
00:29:07,282 --> 00:29:08,407
How is the King?

374
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,187
He must be pleased at your condition.

375
00:29:11,861 --> 00:29:13,063
He is.

376
00:29:14,322 --> 00:29:15,133
But...?

377
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,865
Everything is fine.

378
00:29:22,692 --> 00:29:26,401
But when I was last with child,
the King took a mistress.

379
00:29:27,209 --> 00:29:28,354
And now...

380
00:29:29,713 --> 00:29:31,713
now I fear he will take another,

381
00:29:32,574 --> 00:29:35,450
since I must be careful
for the sake of the child

382
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,985
and not let him enjoy
his conjugal rights.

383
00:29:40,008 --> 00:29:41,905
It is natural for a man,

384
00:29:42,376 --> 00:29:45,896
when his wife is big with child
and not willing to lie with him, to...

385
00:29:46,582 --> 00:29:49,924
find some temporary
consolation... elsewhere.

386
00:29:51,034 --> 00:29:52,542
And for Kings,

387
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,420
it is properly expected.

388
00:29:56,219 --> 00:29:57,421
Sweetheart,

389
00:29:57,541 --> 00:29:59,000
listen to me.

390
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,740
The danger to you, and to us,
is not that the King takes a mistress...

391
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:05,932
but that he takes the wrong one.

392
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:09,192
Someone we can't control,

393
00:30:09,736 --> 00:30:12,190
or who would seek to control the King.

394
00:30:14,698 --> 00:30:16,700
But... if you suppose

395
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,010
the King is sure to take a mistress,

396
00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:21,583
then make sure

397
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:24,207
she is your... choice,

398
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:27,363
and not... his.

399
00:30:33,652 --> 00:30:36,028
I must make my report to the King.

400
00:30:36,263 --> 00:30:37,680
I'll see you later.

401
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:09,831
- Mr. Secretary.
- Reverend Fisher.

402
00:31:10,985 --> 00:31:13,511
I just came to see
if you were being well treated.

403
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,431
As to that, my... aged stomach

404
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:20,460
cannot cope with the rank food
the jailor brings.

405
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:25,260
But that is nothing, since it pertains
to my body and not my soul.

406
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,707
You have not taken the Oath.

407
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:39,863
No.

408
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:41,566
Why not?

409
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:46,547
Do you refuse to accept that
the King's marriage is proper and legal?

410
00:31:48,192 --> 00:31:50,704
I believe His Majesty thinks it so.

411
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,205
But you don't?

412
00:31:53,674 --> 00:31:54,476
No.

413
00:31:55,402 --> 00:31:57,825
I believe what I have always believed...

414
00:31:58,628 --> 00:32:01,357
that the King's marriage
to Queen Katherine is still valid,

415
00:32:01,477 --> 00:32:04,310
and can be undone
by no man, not even...

416
00:32:04,939 --> 00:32:06,770
Archbishop Cranmer.

417
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:14,353
And...

418
00:32:15,536 --> 00:32:17,714
do you dispute that the King is

419
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:20,099
Supreme Head of the Church in England?

420
00:32:20,219 --> 00:32:22,116
Yes, I do. Most emphatically.

421
00:32:23,211 --> 00:32:26,120
The King our Sovereign Lord
is not the Supreme Head on earth

422
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,792
of the Church of England.

423
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:33,870
Tell me,

424
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,702
how is Sir Thomas More?

425
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,200
Jailor!

426
00:32:52,445 --> 00:32:53,731
I will...

427
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:57,490
see if the quality of your food
can be improved.

428
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,876
Thank you.

429
00:33:11,024 --> 00:33:12,893
Why did you get rid of Lady Eleanor?

430
00:33:15,653 --> 00:33:17,834
She stole something precious from me.

431
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,580
- Are you sure she stole it?
- Yes.

432
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,724
I had the evidence. I had no choice.

433
00:33:29,209 --> 00:33:32,645
I hope Your Majesty is not
too disappointed?

434
00:33:37,662 --> 00:33:38,750
In any case,

435
00:33:40,403 --> 00:33:41,934
I have something for you.

436
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:48,790
Your Majesty.

437
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:13,139
Elizabeth.

438
00:34:30,258 --> 00:34:31,254
Thank you.

439
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,514
What's this?

440
00:34:48,607 --> 00:34:52,550
Majesty, there are a number
of small monastic institutions

441
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,679
I have had cause to investigate.

442
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:57,121
The monks there refuse to take the Oath.

443
00:34:57,658 --> 00:35:00,118
They'd rather serve
the Vicar of Rome than you.

444
00:35:01,465 --> 00:35:03,756
This is a bill for their dissolution.

445
00:35:04,106 --> 00:35:06,980
The very considerable wealth
of these houses

446
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,293
will thus be transferred
to Your Majesty's exchequer.

447
00:35:25,502 --> 00:35:26,620
Well?

448
00:35:28,552 --> 00:35:31,660
Majesty, I have just heard
that the Pope intends

449
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,381
to make Reverend Fisher a Cardinal.

450
00:35:37,546 --> 00:35:40,344
Apparently he has already
dispatched a Cardinal's hat.

451
00:35:41,046 --> 00:35:43,572
Then Fisher will have to wear it
upon his shoulders!

452
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,007
For by the time it gets here,
he won't have a head to put it on!

453
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:52,077
And what of More?

454
00:35:53,577 --> 00:35:54,782
I want to know!

455
00:35:55,682 --> 00:35:57,201
Will he take the oath?

456
00:36:00,353 --> 00:36:02,031
How is she? Does she feed well?

457
00:36:02,151 --> 00:36:05,001
She's good in every way, Majesty.
And hardly cries at all,

458
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:07,844
as if she already knows
that she's a Princess.

459
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:12,341
I love you, Elizabeth.

460
00:36:13,332 --> 00:36:15,000
I love you with all my heart

461
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,622
and I bid you never forget it.

462
00:36:25,538 --> 00:36:26,690
Your Majesty.

463
00:36:30,911 --> 00:36:33,963
Before I leave, I wish to say
something to the Lady Mary.

464
00:36:47,233 --> 00:36:48,585
Lady Mary...

465
00:36:53,204 --> 00:36:56,791
Lady Mary, I am here in kindness.

466
00:36:57,488 --> 00:36:59,346
I would welcome you back to court,

467
00:36:59,587 --> 00:37:01,578
and reconcile you with your father,

468
00:37:01,698 --> 00:37:04,210
if you will only accept me as Queen.

469
00:37:10,658 --> 00:37:13,319
I recognize no Queen but my mother.

470
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:17,590
But if the King's mistress

471
00:37:18,271 --> 00:37:20,497
would intercede
with the King on my behalf...

472
00:37:21,549 --> 00:37:23,314
then I would be grateful.

473
00:37:42,397 --> 00:37:43,947
Sir Thomas More.

474
00:37:44,904 --> 00:37:46,018
Sir Thomas.

475
00:37:46,258 --> 00:37:47,564
Mr. Secretary.

476
00:37:48,638 --> 00:37:49,952
Please be seated.

477
00:37:50,271 --> 00:37:52,675
This is but an informal occasion.

478
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:54,901
A little ale, perhaps?

479
00:37:55,283 --> 00:37:56,466
No, thank you.

480
00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:12,890
I'm sure we both know the object

481
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,704
which has brought us together.

482
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:18,340
It is very widely rumoured, Sir Thomas,

483
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,270
that you will refuse to take
the Oath of Succession.

484
00:38:23,527 --> 00:38:26,020
I say this to you
very openly and sincerely,

485
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,727
that I wish no harm
to come to a great man

486
00:38:28,969 --> 00:38:30,920
who has for years enjoyed and deserved

487
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,690
His Majesty's good graces.

488
00:38:33,189 --> 00:38:35,208
I would rather lose my own son

489
00:38:35,328 --> 00:38:37,111
than see any hurt come to you.

490
00:38:39,187 --> 00:38:42,464
May I ask your opinion
of the King's new marriage?

491
00:38:43,705 --> 00:38:45,029
I have no opinion.

492
00:38:46,817 --> 00:38:50,019
I neither murmur at it,
nor dispute upon it.

493
00:38:50,487 --> 00:38:51,802
I never did...

494
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:54,549
and never will.

495
00:38:54,669 --> 00:38:57,450
Then what of His Majesty's claim
to Supremacy

496
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,252
over the Church in England?

497
00:39:02,683 --> 00:39:05,293
I was unsure about this matter...

498
00:39:07,163 --> 00:39:10,040
until I re-read
His Majesty's own pamphlet:

499
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,146
the "Assertio septum Sacramentorum."

500
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:15,067
In fact, I have...

501
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:18,220
I have a copy of it here.

502
00:39:18,776 --> 00:39:20,335
Of course, in the pamphlet,

503
00:39:20,716 --> 00:39:23,920
the King asserts
the divine origin of the papacy.

504
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:26,616
The Pope's supremacy descends directly

505
00:39:26,736 --> 00:39:28,578
from the Rock of St. Peter.

506
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:32,712
I think you'll find
His Majesty's arguments are as...

507
00:39:32,832 --> 00:39:36,402
persuasive and powerful now
as they were when he first wrote them.

508
00:39:43,995 --> 00:39:45,394
Will you take the Oath?

509
00:39:47,264 --> 00:39:50,520
I need hardly remind you
of the consequences of not doing so.

510
00:39:51,915 --> 00:39:53,120
Mr. Secretary,

511
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,083
I am the King's loyal subject.

512
00:39:57,653 --> 00:39:58,873
I say no harm,

513
00:39:59,928 --> 00:40:01,240
I think no harm,

514
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,572
but I wish everybody good.

515
00:40:05,553 --> 00:40:08,605
And if this be not enough
to keep a man alive, in good faith,

516
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:12,420
- I long not to live.
- Sir Thomas...

517
00:40:13,332 --> 00:40:16,126
You should know that
the King himself has no mind

518
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:19,640
to coerce you.
He simply asks you to relent

519
00:40:20,516 --> 00:40:22,525
and condescend to his request

520
00:40:22,645 --> 00:40:24,582
that you take the Oath.

521
00:40:26,853 --> 00:40:30,610
Mr. Cromwell, please impart to the King
my utter faithfulness,

522
00:40:31,165 --> 00:40:33,990
truthfulness, and loyalty to him.

523
00:41:21,734 --> 00:41:22,902
Cousin Madge.

524
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,305
Yes, Madam?

525
00:41:26,855 --> 00:41:28,235
Come and talk to me.

526
00:41:41,936 --> 00:41:44,828
I suppose you have many admirers?

527
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:47,630
Yes,

528
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,950
but I always remember
what Your Majesty told us,

529
00:41:51,486 --> 00:41:54,516
about not being lewd
and setting a standard.

530
00:41:56,354 --> 00:41:57,809
I'm sure you do.

531
00:42:00,903 --> 00:42:04,425
But would it surprise you to learn
that one of your admirers

532
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:05,903
is the King?

533
00:42:09,529 --> 00:42:11,510
- It's not true!
- It is true.

534
00:42:18,022 --> 00:42:20,435
Now, would it surprise you even more

535
00:42:20,933 --> 00:42:23,900
if I told you that
you would have my blessing

536
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,694
to become his mistress?

537
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,276
- Madam!
- While I am with child,

538
00:42:31,396 --> 00:42:34,490
His Majesty needs to be able to lie
with another woman.

539
00:42:36,445 --> 00:42:38,226
He is a passionate man.

540
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,167
But she must be someone I can trust.

541
00:42:42,287 --> 00:42:44,350
Whose family I can trust,

542
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,670
like yours.

543
00:42:47,502 --> 00:42:48,502
After all,

544
00:42:48,622 --> 00:42:50,480
we are family.

545
00:42:52,385 --> 00:42:53,992
And you are reformers.

546
00:42:54,233 --> 00:42:57,060
Yes, Your Majesty.
We all gladly took the oath.

547
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:02,210
And now will you gladly
take the King to your bed?

548
00:43:07,907 --> 00:43:10,570
His Excellency, the Imperial Ambassador.

549
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,181
- Excellency.
- Your Majesty.

550
00:43:16,634 --> 00:43:19,510
Forgive me, but I come here
upon a mission of mercy.

551
00:43:21,091 --> 00:43:22,884
- Mercy?
- Very much so.

552
00:43:23,157 --> 00:43:26,190
Your daughter, the Lady Mary,
has fallen ill,

553
00:43:26,929 --> 00:43:28,791
even to the concern of her doctors.

554
00:43:30,186 --> 00:43:32,810
I have a letter written by her mother.

555
00:43:33,918 --> 00:43:35,852
She would like to nurse her child.

556
00:43:36,968 --> 00:43:39,418
She writes... if I may?

557
00:43:45,794 --> 00:43:49,701
"A little comfort and mirth with me
would be a half health to her."

558
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,729
"I could care for her with my own hands

559
00:43:53,849 --> 00:43:55,642
"and put her in my own bed

560
00:43:56,532 --> 00:43:58,588
"and watch with her when needful."

561
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,990
I will send my personal physician
to examine and help her.

562
00:44:11,768 --> 00:44:15,406
But I cannot allow Mary
and her mother to be together.

563
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:18,604
But, Your Majesty... it is just the cry

564
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:21,525
- of any mother for any daughter.
- But that's just it!

565
00:44:21,645 --> 00:44:23,916
They are not just
any mother or daughter.

566
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:27,931
Do you not suppose
they would conspire to plot against me?

567
00:44:29,152 --> 00:44:31,849
- I cannot believe it.
- Of course you can believe it!

568
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,454
You know it happens.

569
00:44:33,574 --> 00:44:36,530
And that sometimes illness
is used for political purpose.

570
00:44:38,198 --> 00:44:41,850
Do you not believe that Katherine
wants Mary to be Queen above all else?

571
00:44:43,588 --> 00:44:44,903
Mr. Chapuys,

572
00:44:45,598 --> 00:44:48,460
Lady Katherine is a very proud
stubborn woman

573
00:44:48,827 --> 00:44:51,050
of very great and high courage.

574
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:53,910
She could muster an army, take the field

575
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,645
and wage a war against me

576
00:44:55,765 --> 00:44:58,867
as fierce as any her mother Isabella
ever waged in Spain.

577
00:45:03,122 --> 00:45:04,408
Is that not true?

578
00:45:10,651 --> 00:45:13,701
I've been handed a summons
to appear at Lambeth Palace

579
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:16,506
to take the oath.

580
00:45:18,546 --> 00:45:20,723
I imagine I shall be
imprisoned afterwards.

581
00:45:20,963 --> 00:45:22,256
- No!
- Father!

582
00:45:23,533 --> 00:45:25,396
You must be good to each other

583
00:45:26,883 --> 00:45:28,338
and to everyone else.

584
00:45:30,905 --> 00:45:32,858
Or, if you cannot be good,

585
00:45:34,894 --> 00:45:36,670
be the least bad you can be.

586
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:09,051
Darling, no...

587
00:46:42,505 --> 00:46:43,801
Ah! Lady Sheldon.

588
00:46:44,549 --> 00:46:47,101
- Where's the Queen?
- Your Majesty,

589
00:46:47,573 --> 00:46:49,313
the Queen is feeling indisposed

590
00:46:49,433 --> 00:46:52,314
and asks you to forgive her
not riding this morning.

591
00:46:55,219 --> 00:46:56,468
Of course.

592
00:46:57,379 --> 00:46:58,278
She...

593
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,221
She wondered if Your Majesty
would be pleased if...

594
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:05,287
if I took her place.

595
00:47:05,662 --> 00:47:07,230
Riding, I mean.

596
00:47:10,488 --> 00:47:12,314
If the Queen gives her permission,

597
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:14,079
then why not?

598
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:15,440
Lady Sheldon.

599
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:31,396
What's your name, Lady Sheldon?

600
00:48:31,516 --> 00:48:33,358
Margaret, Your Majesty.

601
00:48:33,478 --> 00:48:35,987
Though people call me Madge.

602
00:48:37,726 --> 00:48:40,355
Then I shall call you Madge,
if you'll allow me?

603
00:48:41,286 --> 00:48:42,883
Of course, Your Majesty.

604
00:49:09,418 --> 00:49:10,638
Sir Thomas.

605
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:14,580
Are you now ready to swear the oath?

606
00:49:16,422 --> 00:49:17,577
May I see it?

607
00:49:27,484 --> 00:49:28,535
Thank you.

608
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,240
Well?

609
00:49:41,254 --> 00:49:43,772
I don't mean to put at fault
this oath or its makers

610
00:49:43,892 --> 00:49:45,740
or any man who swears to it.

611
00:49:46,431 --> 00:49:49,689
And I will never condemn
the conscience of any other man.

612
00:49:51,502 --> 00:49:53,249
But for myself, in good faith,

613
00:49:53,902 --> 00:49:56,335
my own conscience
so moves me that I will swear

614
00:49:56,455 --> 00:50:00,012
to the validity of the succession,
yet not the rest of it,

615
00:50:01,173 --> 00:50:04,630
without jeopardizing my soul
to perpetual damnation.

616
00:50:05,456 --> 00:50:07,600
We are very sorry to hear you say this.

617
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,763
You are almost the first to refuse it
and your refusal will cause

618
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,943
the King's highness to be both

619
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:17,072
indignant and suspicious of you.

620
00:50:17,192 --> 00:50:19,981
Here are all the members
of the Commons and the Lords

621
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:21,971
who have sworn to take the oath.

622
00:50:22,091 --> 00:50:24,703
- The clergy too.
- I myself cannot swear.

623
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,362
But I do not blame any other man
who has sworn.

624
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:30,842
Sir Thomas, we have come
to the conclusion

625
00:50:31,658 --> 00:50:34,785
that, far from being a true and loyal

626
00:50:35,001 --> 00:50:37,001
servant to His Majesty,

627
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,948
there never was a servant so villainous,

628
00:50:40,068 --> 00:50:42,460
so traitorous to his prince as you.

629
00:50:42,994 --> 00:50:44,930
If you refuse to take the oath,

630
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:47,480
not only will you be imprisoned,

631
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:51,530
but the most horrid things imaginable
will be done to you.

632
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:54,796
My Lords, these threats
are for children, not for me.

633
00:50:58,511 --> 00:50:59,770
Do you deny...

634
00:51:00,094 --> 00:51:02,606
that you bullied and persuaded the King,

635
00:51:02,847 --> 00:51:04,564
against his conscience,

636
00:51:04,684 --> 00:51:06,777
to write this pamphlet against Luther?

637
00:51:07,017 --> 00:51:08,320
Of course I deny it.

638
00:51:09,457 --> 00:51:13,150
In the first place I never ask anyone,
be he ever so high or so low,

639
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,170
to act against his conscience.
And secondly,

640
00:51:16,462 --> 00:51:19,330
I remember it was His Majesty
who rather persuaded me

641
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:21,640
of the paramount importance
of the papacy.

642
00:51:24,835 --> 00:51:26,704
I ask you a final time,

643
00:51:28,442 --> 00:51:31,793
before the awful penalties
are exacted upon you.

644
00:51:34,907 --> 00:51:36,630
Why will you not swear?

645
00:51:44,076 --> 00:51:45,625
Why will you not swear?

646
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,084
Madge!

647
00:52:03,458 --> 00:52:05,292
What? Madge!

648
00:52:06,618 --> 00:52:08,066
I don't know. It's funny.

649
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,230
Madge.

650
00:52:14,997 --> 00:52:17,430
I like your dimples
when you laugh, Madge.

651
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:23,620
Madge.

652
00:52:24,783 --> 00:52:26,040
Your Majesty.

653
00:52:30,126 --> 00:52:31,159
Come here.

654
00:52:47,236 --> 00:52:48,330
Let me...

655
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:51,170
examine your dimples

656
00:52:52,404 --> 00:52:54,134
a little more closely.

657
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:00,919
Sir Thomas.

658
00:53:02,336 --> 00:53:03,460
Thank you.

659
00:53:06,562 --> 00:53:10,121
Oh, and... your Highness might like
to know that the Reverend Fisher

660
00:53:10,241 --> 00:53:12,280
is lodged in the room down below.

661
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,532
Good day to you, sir.
