00:00:00,341 --> 00:00:01,523
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,587
In this realm,
there should be perfect love.

3
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:07,316
But instead, there is discord
and dissention in every place.

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:11,511
It doesn't seem to matter
who I talk to at court.

5
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:15,036
All about me now is guile,
hypocrisy, and dishonesty.

6
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:19,352
I fear more than ever, the plots
about the court and the King.

7
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:23,551
Men conspire to secure their future
by controlling the Prince.

8
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,923
My poor brother is being brought up
a Protestant and a heretic.

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,237
And the King does
nothing to stop it.

10
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:32,324
- I have written a book.
- You call the Pope's clergy riff-Raff.

11
00:00:33,449 --> 00:00:35,523
Bishop Gardiner
has arrested my sister

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,948
and two of my ladies
on suspicion of heresy.

13
00:00:38,115 --> 00:00:40,417
We have discovered certain books.

14
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:43,284
In the closets
of the Queen's ladies.

15
00:00:43,451 --> 00:00:45,515
Your Majesty has begun a great work,

16
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,547
banishing
the monstrous idol of Rome.

17
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,758
<i>You can finish that work</i>

18
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,260
by purging the Church of England
of its dregs.

19
00:00:53,164 --> 00:00:56,097
Majesty, many of the greatest
subjects in the land

20
00:00:56,574 --> 00:00:59,789
defending those same arguments
have deserved death.

21
00:00:59,956 --> 00:01:02,646
I cannot believe that you would accuse
the Queen of heresy.

22
00:01:03,068 --> 00:01:04,105
I have the proof.

<i>we know nothing.</i>

39
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:07,632
In these last days

40
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,116
I have been thinking
a great deal about loss.

41
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:13,892
What loss, Your Grace,

42
00:03:14,505 --> 00:03:16,446
is to man the most irrecoverable?

43
00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:19,165
- His virtue.
- No.

44
00:03:19,842 --> 00:03:22,118
For by his actions,
he may redeem his virtue.

45
00:03:23,332 --> 00:03:24,941
- Then his honor.
- No.

46
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:28,139
For again, he may find
the means to recover it,

47
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:31,377
even as a man recovers
some fortune he has lost.

48
00:03:33,643 --> 00:03:35,340
Then I cannot say, Your Majesty.

49
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,940
Time, Your Grace.

50
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,592
Of all losses,

51
00:03:41,551 --> 00:03:43,541
time is the most irrecoverable,

52
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:46,465
for it can never be redeemed.

53
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:06,087
Walter!

54
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:11,459
Take this...

55
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:14,796
very carefully and give it...

56
00:04:15,945 --> 00:04:17,292
to My Lord Risley.

57
00:04:19,435 --> 00:04:20,735
Yes, Your Grace.

58
00:04:26,082 --> 00:04:28,512
The Lord High Admiral of France.

59
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,211
<i>Salutationes Domine,.</i>

60
00:04:42,871 --> 00:04:44,742
<i>Praefectus Magnus Galliae.</i>

61
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:48,878
<i>Salvete Regis Enrici
octavi maiestatis.</i>

62
00:04:55,322 --> 00:04:56,776
Thank you, Your Highness.

63
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:59,739
It is my great privilege
and honor to be here.

64
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,634
My Lord Admiral.

65
00:05:05,707 --> 00:05:08,984
May I present his Majesty's daughters,
the Lady Mary

66
00:05:09,151 --> 00:05:10,476
and the Lady Elizabeth.

67
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:15,648
I never thought to be welcomed
by His Majesty's family.

68
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:20,287
You are a special and honored guest,
Admiral D'Annibault.

69
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:22,828
And your visit most timely.

70
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:27,198
I am sure His Majesty
will be here presently.

71
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,586
My Lord Hertford seems
to be in the King's good graces.

72
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,681
I fear it seems to be so.

73
00:05:39,993 --> 00:05:44,093
The Earl grows more powerful daily
because of the King's infirmity

74
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,105
and his control of the boy.

75
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,427
God help us then
if the King should die.

76
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:55,003
But I have heard many say

77
00:05:55,575 --> 00:05:58,957
that the people would rather
see you anointed as Queen

78
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:00,735
than...

79
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,172
leave the country
at the mercy of a mere child

80
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:07,718
and an overweening uncle.

81
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:10,804
And what of the Queen?

82
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:15,170
You shall hear more
on that subject...

83
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,583
very soon.

84
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,880
The King!

85
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:45,864
Admiral.

86
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:51,865
We are very pleased
to make a new treaty with France.

87
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:55,665
I will have no further business
with the Emperor...

88
00:06:57,636 --> 00:06:59,834
who has betrayed me at every turn.

89
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:03,462
You will find us good
and faithful friends...

90
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,248
unlike the Emperor.

91
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:07,139
As you know,

92
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:11,548
in my Kingdom I have made
many changes to religious life.

93
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,763
I have reformed a corrupt church.

94
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:19,155
I have swept aside hundreds of years

95
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:21,835
of lies and superstitions.

96
00:07:22,504 --> 00:07:24,986
I have revealed to all mankind

97
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,720
that the Pope
is but a fallible prince,

98
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:30,408
and not the voice of God.

99
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,761
All this, no doubt,
you'll have heard.

100
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:36,546
I am certainly aware
that Your Majesty has wrought

101
00:07:36,713 --> 00:07:39,292
many changes in your own Kingdom.

102
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:44,375
Well, if we are going
to be allies, Monsieur,

103
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:47,091
then I propose a further change.

104
00:07:48,191 --> 00:07:51,095
I propose that Mass be abolished

105
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,789
in both our realms

106
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:56,893
and replaced
with a simple communion service.

107
00:07:58,124 --> 00:08:00,741
Now, how would you feel about that?

108
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,034
I have no authority to renegotiate
the terms of our treaty,

109
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:13,764
especially, as Your Majesty knows,
my King is dying.

110
00:08:14,915 --> 00:08:16,415
Of syphilis, I know.

111
00:08:17,053 --> 00:08:18,767
I am very sorry to hear it.

112
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,501
I have known Francis a long time,

113
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,372
and I beg you to send him my love.

114
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:27,172
But you may also tell him

115
00:08:27,794 --> 00:08:31,330
that his disease is a reminder
of his own mortality!

116
00:08:32,394 --> 00:08:35,098
Which, in times past,
he has forgotten!

117
00:08:47,053 --> 00:08:49,028
I have something for you
to show the Queen.

118
00:08:50,068 --> 00:08:52,096
I'm supposed to take it
to Lord Risley.

119
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:55,034
When the Queen's read it,
give it back to me.

120
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,648
... so handsome.

121
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:00,986
Oh, hush, sister.

122
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,377
What is it?

123
00:09:17,277 --> 00:09:18,277
Oh my God.

124
00:09:21,606 --> 00:09:22,756
What is that?

125
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:25,973
Who is it?

126
00:09:27,187 --> 00:09:30,095
It's the Queen's Majesty,
Your Majesty.

127
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:34,726
Why is she screaming like that?

128
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,226
I'll go and see her.

129
00:09:54,088 --> 00:09:55,094
What is it?

130
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:11,533
I...

131
00:10:14,106 --> 00:10:15,114
I fear...

132
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,700
you have grown displeased with me.

133
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:20,776
Why so?

134
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:29,455
Because...

135
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,079
I fear that you have
utterly forsaken me.

136
00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:39,699
I don't understand.

137
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:43,101
What has caused you to think so?

138
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:47,639
Why would I have reason
to be displeased with you?

139
00:10:59,622 --> 00:11:00,672
Are you not

140
00:11:02,085 --> 00:11:03,535
displeased with me?

141
00:11:06,507 --> 00:11:08,457
I will ask you one more time:

142
00:11:09,813 --> 00:11:11,545
is there any reason I should be?

143
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,290
There is none, Your Majesty.

144
00:11:27,756 --> 00:11:29,156
Good day, My Lady.

145
00:11:38,358 --> 00:11:39,358
Sister!

146
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:40,689
Ladies!

147
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,119
Now, you must do as I ask.

148
00:11:43,573 --> 00:11:45,259
Clear your coffers of all books

149
00:11:45,426 --> 00:11:47,493
whether you suppose them
to be forbidden or not!

150
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,000
From now on we shall talk

151
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,888
no more, amongst ourselves,

152
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,162
of any matters, whether religious
or controversial,

153
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,827
and I shall try, in all things,

154
00:11:56,994 --> 00:11:59,101
to conform myself
to the King's mind.

155
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:01,753
Now go.
Hurry!

156
00:12:08,036 --> 00:12:09,036
Good day.

157
00:12:10,513 --> 00:12:12,398
May I be presented to His Grace?

158
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:16,340
Alas, my Lord,
His Grace is indisposed.

159
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:19,030
He caught a chill and is still abed.

160
00:12:20,148 --> 00:12:21,832
I am very sorry to hear it.

161
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:24,869
I will return some other time,
when the Duke is well.

162
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,419
No, no, my Lord.

163
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,471
I am...

164
00:12:29,862 --> 00:12:31,167
well enough to see you.

165
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:50,356
I think your faction is engaged

166
00:12:50,523 --> 00:12:53,564
in a fight to the death
with Bishop Gardiner and his.

167
00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:57,693
I will not hide the truth from you.

168
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:01,072
The King's infirmity

169
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,460
and the youth of my nephew

170
00:13:03,975 --> 00:13:06,797
make the question
of succession urgent.

171
00:13:08,258 --> 00:13:10,615
The stakes could not possibly
be higher.

172
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:13,404
And you desire to know, I assume,

173
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:15,795
on which side of the argument
I belong?

174
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:21,521
Your Grace,
whether you will it or not,

175
00:13:21,831 --> 00:13:25,179
you carry a great weight of confidence
and influence with the King.

176
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:27,184
And everyone knows that.

177
00:13:27,351 --> 00:13:29,558
But fewer people know
that your wife, the Duchess,

178
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,220
and my wife Anne,
together with the Queen,

179
00:13:32,387 --> 00:13:35,898
are as close on matters of religion
as it is possible to be.

180
00:13:37,044 --> 00:13:38,692
And this close affinity has

181
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:41,642
emboldened me, now,
to approach Your Grace.

182
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,264
Surely your wife has told you

183
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:46,762
that the Duchess
and I are estranged!

184
00:13:47,574 --> 00:13:51,094
Thus her affinities
are not necessarily my own

185
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:54,752
and you do me a disservice
to assume they are.

186
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,522
Your Grace, forgive me...

187
00:14:01,877 --> 00:14:03,103
I do forgive you.

188
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,929
I forgive you
even for hounding poor,

189
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,266
proud Surrey to his death...

190
00:14:10,758 --> 00:14:12,308
for it was his fault.

191
00:14:15,636 --> 00:14:17,000
But as to religion.

192
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:19,879
I have never read the Gospels,
and never shall.

193
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:24,113
I am sure they enlighten you,
but I prefer them to remain mysterious.

194
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,491
And, as for the promise
of a better world,

195
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,541
I can only say that England
was merry before,

196
00:14:31,724 --> 00:14:33,524
and all things considered,

197
00:14:34,683 --> 00:14:37,102
I would all things
were as they used to be

198
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:38,469
in times past.

199
00:14:43,204 --> 00:14:45,963
Your Grace, if I do not have
your support,

200
00:14:47,692 --> 00:14:50,370
may I ask if you will act
against me?

201
00:14:52,452 --> 00:14:55,352
I'm not sure if this is any answer,
My Lord Hertford.

202
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:59,148
I have always been drawn to a phrase
used by the French peasants:

203
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:01,683
"Praise the God of all,

204
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:03,775
"drink the wine,

205
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:07,227
and let the world be the world."

206
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,712
My Lady Hertford.

207
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:27,209
I was summoned here
but I have no idea why.

208
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:29,467
I wonder how I may help you?

209
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:33,844
You may help me, My Lady,
by telling me the truth.

210
00:15:35,593 --> 00:15:37,202
You were a friend, I believe,

211
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:40,470
of the heretic Anne Askew,

212
00:15:41,313 --> 00:15:42,613
recently burned?

213
00:15:43,808 --> 00:15:45,611
I was acquainted with her.

214
00:15:46,618 --> 00:15:48,639
You were more than acquainted,
I think.

215
00:15:48,806 --> 00:15:51,065
While she was a prisoner,
one of your servant,

216
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:54,741
a man wearing a blue coat...
gave her money.

217
00:15:56,549 --> 00:15:58,999
I desired to make her
circumstances more tolerable.

218
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,878
I was only acting
out of Christian charity.

219
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:06,173
I had been informed
that those who tortured her,

220
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:09,190
illegally, had stretched
her on the rack

221
00:16:09,357 --> 00:16:12,557
until the strings of her arms
and legs were perished.

222
00:16:13,275 --> 00:16:15,149
But you admit

223
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:17,685
she was a self-confessed heretic?

224
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,532
You are therefore guilty
by association.

225
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,494
You have a warrant for my arrest?

226
00:16:39,757 --> 00:16:42,222
You will never serve that warrant.

227
00:16:43,224 --> 00:16:44,224
Why not?

228
00:16:45,645 --> 00:16:47,495
Because I know your secret.

229
00:16:49,331 --> 00:16:52,219
What secret, My Lady Hertford?

230
00:16:53,334 --> 00:16:56,961
You are not such a saint
as you appear are you, Your Grace?

231
00:16:58,022 --> 00:17:01,190
You have not exactly
renounced worldly goods...

232
00:17:02,124 --> 00:17:03,188
have you?

233
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:06,617
There are two monasteries
in Cornwall.

234
00:17:06,784 --> 00:17:09,945
They were stripped and closed,
on His Majesty's orders, and burnt.

235
00:17:11,122 --> 00:17:12,122
Except...

236
00:17:12,928 --> 00:17:15,578
that they were neither stripped
nor burnt,

237
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:19,781
but their titles and contents
were transferred to Your Grace.

238
00:17:20,948 --> 00:17:24,191
Thus, you are a rich man indeed...

239
00:17:25,817 --> 00:17:28,217
but only by embezzling
from the King.

240
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:32,426
I advise you
to tear up your warrant,

241
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:05,787
Her Majesty the Queen.

242
00:18:15,236 --> 00:18:16,386
Come in here.

243
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:36,615
I am glad you have come.

244
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:40,096
You can resolve
me of certain doubts.

245
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:44,081
I wonder, Kate,
how much you think you can learn

246
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,625
from reading the Gospels
and other religious books?

247
00:18:49,484 --> 00:18:53,402
Since God has appointed you
as Supreme Head of us all,

248
00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:56,635
it is from you
that I will ever learn.

249
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,264
But that surely is not so!

250
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:02,975
You have become a doctor, Kate,

251
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,375
to instruct us, as we have seen
many times before...

252
00:19:07,384 --> 00:19:10,644
but not to be instructed
or directed by us!

253
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:15,487
Majesty, I think my meaning
has been mistaken

254
00:19:16,795 --> 00:19:18,593
for I have always
held it preposterous

255
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,660
- for a woman to instruct her Lord.
- And yet,

256
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,873
you seem sometimes
to have a different view

257
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,786
of religion than we do.

258
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:28,891
Only so that you could correct me!

259
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,696
Forgive me, Your Majesty,

260
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,806
but I thought that talking
and discussing

261
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:39,971
helped to ease the pain and weariness
of your present infirmity.

262
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,329
And it encouraged me in my boldness,

263
00:19:44,452 --> 00:19:46,268
in the hope of profiting

264
00:19:46,764 --> 00:19:48,800
from your learned discourse.

265
00:19:50,462 --> 00:19:51,462
I am,

266
00:19:52,788 --> 00:19:54,229
I am but a woman,

267
00:19:55,665 --> 00:19:59,172
with all the imperfections natural

268
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:01,139
to the weakness of my sex,

269
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:06,288
and therefore,
in all matters of doubt and difficulty

270
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:09,644
I must refer myself

271
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,790
to Your Majesty's better judgment,

272
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,298
as my Lord and head.

273
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:23,722
Is that so, sweetheart?

274
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,923
And you made your argument
for no worse ends?

275
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,568
Then we are perfect friends again.

276
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:40,614
I thank Your Majesty.

277
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,830
I promise

278
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,251
that I will never doubt you again.

279
00:21:00,982 --> 00:21:02,032
Sweet Kate.

280
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:20,797
Shall I rescind Your Majesty's order
to arrest the Queen tomorrow?

281
00:21:22,412 --> 00:21:23,426
Why?

282
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,630
Music.

283
00:21:38,308 --> 00:21:39,958
What is it, sweetheart?

284
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,134
Nothing.

285
00:21:44,967 --> 00:21:46,217
I was dreaming.

286
00:21:48,784 --> 00:21:50,437
We were back in Boulogne...

287
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:53,854
but I let you go.

288
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,700
I'm here.

289
00:22:02,773 --> 00:22:05,523
- Has the dawn come yet?
- Not yet. Not yet.

290
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:14,049
I hate the nights.

291
00:22:16,647 --> 00:22:19,497
- I think of perpetual night.
- Hush, darling.

292
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,470
The dawn will be here soon,
and you well again.

293
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:35,187
Yes, my darling?

294
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:39,399
I'm so happy.

295
00:23:00,126 --> 00:23:01,733
What is this?

296
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:08,595
Lord Chancellor!
Why have you come?

297
00:23:10,373 --> 00:23:12,641
I have come to execute
the warrant for the Queen's arrest

298
00:23:13,114 --> 00:23:15,352
and to escort her,
and her Ladies, to the Tower.

299
00:23:15,808 --> 00:23:17,407
You knave!

300
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:21,389
You arrant knave!

301
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,860
Get out! Get out of my sight!

302
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,320
- Majesty...
- Get out!

303
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,710
And take your bastards with you.

304
00:23:36,987 --> 00:23:37,987
I am so...

305
00:23:39,135 --> 00:23:41,628
sorry that...
the Lord Chancellor should

306
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,855
make such a mistake.

307
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:50,266
You don't how little
he deserves your sympathy.

308
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,933
He was not your friend, Kate.

309
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:09,210
- Lord Hertford!
- My Lord Hertford!

310
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:14,647
Your Grace,
I have already explained,

311
00:24:14,814 --> 00:24:17,039
he called me a knave!
All manner of things.

312
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,694
But for whose ears?

313
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,739
Supposing he still wants the Queen
to feel falsely secure?

314
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,780
If it was feigned anger,
it seemed very real to me!

315
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,794
My Lords, in the King's absence,

316
00:24:31,961 --> 00:24:35,082
Council is called upon
to declare its content

317
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:37,679
with the terms of the peace treaty
with France.

318
00:24:37,846 --> 00:24:39,686
All in favour say "aye"

319
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,936
Aye.

320
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,941
Council is also called upon
to discuss all arrangements made

321
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:47,410
for the security and safety

322
00:24:47,577 --> 00:24:50,489
of His Highness Prince Edward,
heir to the throne,

323
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:52,783
and all provisions made

324
00:24:53,064 --> 00:24:55,494
for his temporal
and spiritual welfare.

325
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:58,379
My Lords, pray,

326
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:01,917
what induces you to discuss
such things now,

327
00:25:02,173 --> 00:25:05,754
when all provisions are already made
and the Prince is secure at Windsor,

328
00:25:06,108 --> 00:25:07,808
by His Majesty's orders?

329
00:25:08,335 --> 00:25:09,335
Aye.

330
00:25:09,571 --> 00:25:10,675
My Lord Hertford,

331
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:15,023
Council is still constituted
to examine such matters,

332
00:25:15,311 --> 00:25:17,680
especially since
the King's infirmities

333
00:25:18,118 --> 00:25:20,352
give us all cause
to think of the future.

334
00:25:21,407 --> 00:25:24,366
And it is treason,
my Lord Chancellor,

335
00:25:24,749 --> 00:25:26,233
to envisage the King's death!

336
00:25:26,749 --> 00:25:29,611
My Lord, all our concern
is for the Prince.

337
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,061
Your concern?!

338
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:33,990
Are you forgetting
that he is of my blood?

339
00:25:34,272 --> 00:25:37,327
He is also of the King's blood,

340
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:40,831
which gives us cause enough
to examine those put in charge of him.

341
00:25:41,222 --> 00:25:44,507
And among them, some of whom
we find, like his tutors,

342
00:25:44,674 --> 00:25:46,578
to be suspected heretics!

343
00:25:46,968 --> 00:25:49,407
You talk of heresy! You!

344
00:25:50,221 --> 00:25:53,927
And what are you but a puffed-up
porkling of the Pope's?

345
00:25:54,225 --> 00:25:55,225
My Lord!

346
00:25:58,047 --> 00:26:00,718
I still say, my Lord Hertford...

347
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:03,849
that the real truth behind
your intentions

348
00:26:04,016 --> 00:26:06,518
towards the Prince and the Crown

349
00:26:06,918 --> 00:26:08,692
must be placed before the King.

350
00:26:13,025 --> 00:26:15,593
- What are you doing?
- Take your hands off!

351
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:25,523
Bishop Gardiner desires
an audience with your Majesty.

352
00:26:27,302 --> 00:26:28,378
Refused.

353
00:26:29,028 --> 00:26:31,228
His Grace has a troublesome nature

354
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:34,432
and I don't want to see him here
ever again.

355
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:37,330
I desire him to leave my Court.

356
00:26:38,734 --> 00:26:40,186
Yes, Your Majesty.

357
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,950
Your Grace, His Majesty
instructs you to leave Court.

358
00:27:46,513 --> 00:27:48,732
- My Lord Hertford.
- Lord Hertford.

359
00:27:53,362 --> 00:27:56,267
Lord Chancellor.
What may I do for you?

360
00:27:56,716 --> 00:28:00,170
You may forgive me,
if you find it possible to do so,

361
00:28:00,337 --> 00:28:03,223
from some past associations,
which I now regret.

362
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,164
I have no hesitation in pledging my
utter loyalty to Your Lordship's House,

363
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,820
and I trust in future
I can serve you

364
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,530
as faithfully as I have
always served His Majesty.

365
00:28:17,972 --> 00:28:21,205
I am most grateful to you,
my Lord Chancellor.

366
00:28:43,383 --> 00:28:44,472
Mr. Holbein.

367
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,884
- Mr. Holbein.
- Majesty.

368
00:28:56,363 --> 00:28:57,902
I have a commission for you.

369
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,461
I am most grateful to Your Majesty.

370
00:29:02,498 --> 00:29:04,409
I assume Your Majesty
means a portrait?

371
00:29:05,707 --> 00:29:07,385
You once painted my father.

372
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:09,753
Now you will paint me.

373
00:29:10,154 --> 00:29:11,654
I am deeply honored.

374
00:29:16,283 --> 00:29:17,333
Sweetheart,

375
00:29:18,612 --> 00:29:19,662
sweetheart,

376
00:29:20,598 --> 00:29:22,998
here is a messenger
from His Majesty.

377
00:29:32,832 --> 00:29:34,051
Your Grace,

378
00:29:34,351 --> 00:29:36,814
His Majesty has heard
of your indisposition

379
00:29:37,105 --> 00:29:39,146
and has asked to see you.

380
00:29:41,543 --> 00:29:42,543
No!

381
00:29:43,313 --> 00:29:45,813
That is impossible,
ask the physicians.

382
00:29:50,553 --> 00:29:52,553
What shall I tell His Majesty?

383
00:29:52,854 --> 00:29:53,904
Tell him...

384
00:29:55,526 --> 00:29:56,676
I shall come.

385
00:29:58,065 --> 00:29:59,265
But you can't!

386
00:30:01,788 --> 00:30:03,596
How can I lie in bed, my love,

387
00:30:03,763 --> 00:30:06,185
when the King of England
has summoned me?

388
00:30:07,664 --> 00:30:09,391
Just get them to help me.

389
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:04,779
What are you doing here?

390
00:31:05,787 --> 00:31:07,837
I have come to see my daughter.

391
00:31:09,405 --> 00:31:11,679
Why should that surprise you, Henry?

392
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:16,152
You have not always
been kind to her.

393
00:31:16,781 --> 00:31:19,127
I have wept so often

394
00:31:19,648 --> 00:31:20,963
to see her alone,

395
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:23,287
abandoned by her father.

396
00:31:26,472 --> 00:31:28,499
Is that why you've come back,

397
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,140
to chide me

398
00:31:34,281 --> 00:31:35,810
for all that I am not?

399
00:31:36,408 --> 00:31:39,904
She ought to be a long time
married by now.

400
00:31:40,071 --> 00:31:42,321
She ought to have her own children.

401
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:46,905
Go away,

402
00:31:47,618 --> 00:31:48,618
shade.

403
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,683
Go away, Katherine.

404
00:31:54,318 --> 00:31:56,118
You sent me away before...

405
00:31:57,663 --> 00:31:59,113
though I loved you.

406
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:05,135
But I was still your wife
in God's eyes.

407
00:32:06,062 --> 00:32:07,678
And still am.

408
00:32:32,249 --> 00:32:34,249
His Grace the Duke of Suffolk.

409
00:32:51,923 --> 00:32:52,923
Charles.

410
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:55,906
Majesty.

411
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,358
They told me you were ill.

412
00:32:59,748 --> 00:33:01,248
So I had to see you.

413
00:33:05,424 --> 00:33:07,024
I have a slight fever.

414
00:33:08,766 --> 00:33:12,067
Perhaps Your Majesty should
not come so close.

415
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:18,259
We've known each other a long time,

416
00:33:19,314 --> 00:33:20,862
a very long time.

417
00:33:25,573 --> 00:33:27,088
And I remember everything.

418
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,383
In fact,

419
00:33:32,675 --> 00:33:35,675
I remember things from long ago

420
00:33:37,467 --> 00:33:39,617
better than I remember yesterday.

421
00:33:44,334 --> 00:33:46,441
I remember Your Majesty's
sister so well.

422
00:33:51,202 --> 00:33:53,102
And the Battle of the Spurs!

423
00:33:57,265 --> 00:33:59,370
And when Your Majesty
made me a Duke...

424
00:34:04,611 --> 00:34:05,811
God knows why!

425
00:34:09,413 --> 00:34:10,913
You were my general,

426
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:13,440
in York and in France,

427
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:16,489
because I could trust no one else.

428
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,873
And I beg you now Charles,

429
00:34:23,435 --> 00:34:24,535
to trust me.

430
00:34:30,347 --> 00:34:33,029
I have the power
to make you well again,

431
00:34:33,484 --> 00:34:34,684
you know that.

432
00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:41,966
They told me you were like to die...

433
00:34:42,867 --> 00:34:44,267
but you won't die.

434
00:34:45,689 --> 00:34:46,789
I forbid it!

435
00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:51,172
Kneel.

436
00:35:12,305 --> 00:35:13,611
By the grace of God,

437
00:35:14,387 --> 00:35:16,401
I, the Eighth Henry,

438
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:20,593
King of England,
Ireland, and France,

439
00:35:22,232 --> 00:35:23,621
Defender of the Faith

440
00:35:25,103 --> 00:35:27,003
and of the Church of England

441
00:35:28,223 --> 00:35:29,973
command you to be healed!

442
00:36:32,121 --> 00:36:33,421
My Lady Suffolk.

443
00:36:39,257 --> 00:36:40,307
Your Grace.

444
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:44,243
May I say, on behalf of all
His Grace's loyal servants and staff,

445
00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:47,142
that we are as heart-broken
and wretched

446
00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:49,874
as Your Grace must be
on this unhappy day.

447
00:36:51,062 --> 00:36:52,862
For we all loved His Grace

448
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,040
as much as you, his wife,
and son, loved him.

449
00:36:56,901 --> 00:36:57,901
Thank you.

450
00:36:58,068 --> 00:37:00,843
Your sympathy and loyalty
touch my son and I most deeply.

451
00:37:08,762 --> 00:37:09,762
Madame.

452
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:24,048
<i>Requiescant in pace Domini.</i>

453
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:26,661
<i>Et Lux perpetua luceat eis.</i>

454
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:29,224
<i>Requiescant in pace.</i>

455
00:37:39,427 --> 00:37:42,701
He is to be buried
at St George's Chapel at Windsor.

456
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,490
At my expense.

457
00:37:50,153 --> 00:37:52,843
I tell you this, my Lord Hertford:

458
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:57,211
as long as Charles Brandon
served me,

459
00:37:57,948 --> 00:37:59,652
he never betrayed a friend,

460
00:38:01,427 --> 00:38:04,505
nor ever took unfair advantage
of an enemy.

461
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:11,559
Which is more than I can say
for anyone else at my Court!

462
00:38:16,251 --> 00:38:18,201
I never thought he would die.

463
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:27,101
We should talk, my Lord Hertford,
about the arrangements

464
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,220
for the Prince's minority

465
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,450
after I am dead!

466
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,191
Mr. Holbein is here.

467
00:38:49,885 --> 00:38:50,985
Mr. Holbein.

468
00:38:53,341 --> 00:38:56,396
With your permission, I came
to show you my work in progress.

469
00:39:10,745 --> 00:39:11,974
Master Holbein.

470
00:39:13,786 --> 00:39:15,559
When you painted my father,

471
00:39:16,406 --> 00:39:17,956
you made his likeness

472
00:39:18,283 --> 00:39:21,666
when he was old, sickly, and ill.

473
00:39:23,524 --> 00:39:25,655
He looked nothing
like a King of England,

474
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:29,122
more like a poor wretch!

475
00:39:30,566 --> 00:39:34,512
A feeble, plain, and dying man.

476
00:39:36,736 --> 00:39:38,724
And now you have done
the same for me!

477
00:39:39,785 --> 00:39:42,738
Mr. Holbein, this portrait is a lie!

478
00:39:49,957 --> 00:39:51,057
Do it again!

479
00:39:52,596 --> 00:39:53,696
And get out.

480
00:40:36,931 --> 00:40:38,281
Why are you here?

481
00:40:38,876 --> 00:40:40,326
To see my daughter.

482
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,814
She was the only pure
thing in my life.

483
00:40:43,981 --> 00:40:45,858
And in my life I neglected her,

484
00:40:46,025 --> 00:40:49,753
since she was only a girl,
and I wanted so much to give you a son.

485
00:40:50,262 --> 00:40:52,212
But now I am so proud of her.

486
00:40:52,974 --> 00:40:56,226
Fiercely proud!
She is so clever.

487
00:40:57,509 --> 00:40:59,797
And though she is like me
in so many ways,

488
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:02,501
she is not intemperate as I was.

489
00:41:03,693 --> 00:41:05,993
You must be proud of her too, Henry.

490
00:41:09,077 --> 00:41:10,077
I am.

491
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:12,511
I am very proud of her.

492
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:17,364
And I know how clever she is.

493
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:25,077
And I wish
that I could love her more.

494
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,490
But from time to time

495
00:41:33,604 --> 00:41:35,159
she reminds me of you...

496
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:38,364
and of what you did to me.

497
00:41:38,531 --> 00:41:40,081
I did nothing to you.

498
00:41:41,175 --> 00:41:42,425
I was innocent.

499
00:41:43,406 --> 00:41:46,009
All the accusations
against me were false.

500
00:41:47,737 --> 00:41:49,187
I thought you knew.

501
00:41:52,616 --> 00:41:54,216
Poor Katherine Howard.

502
00:41:55,176 --> 00:41:57,806
She lies in the cold
ground next to me.

503
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:00,034
Poor child.

504
00:42:01,242 --> 00:42:02,893
It was not her fault either.

505
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:07,331
But we were like two moths,
drawn to the flame...

506
00:42:09,223 --> 00:42:10,236
and burned.

507
00:42:20,957 --> 00:42:22,407
Anne, please don't!

508
00:42:39,148 --> 00:42:40,748
His Majesty, the King.

509
00:42:56,249 --> 00:42:57,349
Lady Mary...

510
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:00,692
Lady Elizabeth...

511
00:43:03,837 --> 00:43:04,837
Kate...

512
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,625
Come here!

513
00:43:12,178 --> 00:43:13,378
I have decided

514
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:15,959
to send you away to Greenwich.

515
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,918
I will not spend Christmastide
with you this year,

516
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:21,807
or thereafter.

517
00:43:25,816 --> 00:43:27,766
- Why, Your Majesty?
- Kate,

518
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:30,581
do not question my command.

519
00:43:31,862 --> 00:43:33,068
It is as it is.

520
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:34,904
Yes, Your Majesty.

521
00:43:43,677 --> 00:43:44,677
Mary.

522
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:49,046
You must be a kind
and loving mother to your brother,

523
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,102
who I leave in this world

524
00:43:52,858 --> 00:43:54,558
a helpless little child.

525
00:43:57,351 --> 00:43:59,151
Please, father, I beg you,

526
00:43:59,644 --> 00:44:01,555
do not leave me an orphan so soon!

527
00:44:02,899 --> 00:44:03,899
Mary,

528
00:44:05,664 --> 00:44:06,664
Mary.

529
00:44:13,566 --> 00:44:14,566
Elizabeth.

530
00:44:23,326 --> 00:44:24,968
You are so very young,

531
00:44:25,494 --> 00:44:28,094
but you, too
can look after your brother.

532
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:30,442
Yes, Your Majesty.

533
00:44:31,316 --> 00:44:32,316
I promise.

534
00:44:34,436 --> 00:44:35,786
Bless you, child.

535
00:44:37,121 --> 00:44:38,121
Bless you.

536
00:44:55,117 --> 00:44:58,334
The time has come
for us to bid farewell.

537
00:44:59,685 --> 00:45:01,035
It is God's will.

538
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,417
When I die,

539
00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:09,044
I order these gentlemen to treat you
as if I were living still.

540
00:45:11,205 --> 00:45:13,655
And if it is your pleasure
to remarry,

541
00:45:15,269 --> 00:45:18,241
I order that you shall
have 7,000 pounds a year

542
00:45:19,282 --> 00:45:22,124
as long as you live
for your service,

543
00:45:23,961 --> 00:45:26,906
as well as your jewels
and ornaments.

544
00:45:56,172 --> 00:45:57,172
Now go.

545
00:46:34,745 --> 00:46:35,945
How is my son?

546
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,680
Jane!

547
00:46:49,296 --> 00:46:50,346
He is well.

548
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:54,489
I have taken all care of him...

549
00:46:56,543 --> 00:46:57,593
sweet Jane.

550
00:46:59,988 --> 00:47:02,413
And soon, he will be King.

551
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:08,406
My poor boy.

552
00:47:10,553 --> 00:47:12,413
My poor child.

553
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:14,070
No!

554
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:16,660
He is the most beloved.

555
00:47:20,272 --> 00:47:21,822
He is my special boy.

556
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,884
He will die young.

557
00:47:26,837 --> 00:47:28,018
No! No!

558
00:47:29,578 --> 00:47:32,373
Poor child,
you expected too much of him!

559
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,349
He was only a boy!

560
00:47:36,415 --> 00:47:38,717
Kings, too, are made of clay!

561
00:47:39,729 --> 00:47:42,177
And God forbid you locked him away
from the world,

562
00:47:42,344 --> 00:47:44,001
like your father did with you.

563
00:47:44,168 --> 00:47:45,168
No!

564
00:47:46,057 --> 00:47:47,607
Don't you understand?

565
00:47:48,985 --> 00:47:50,373
You have killed him!

566
00:47:51,638 --> 00:47:52,638
No!

567
00:48:13,492 --> 00:48:16,478
Herewith, my Lords, is my testament.

568
00:48:17,875 --> 00:48:19,125
When I am dead,

569
00:48:19,765 --> 00:48:22,506
my Lord Hertford
will act as Lord Protector

570
00:48:23,115 --> 00:48:24,874
during Prince Edward's minority.

571
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,939
He will be supported
by my Lord Chancellor Risley

572
00:48:29,793 --> 00:48:31,408
and Archbishop Cranmer.

573
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:35,579
It is my desire

574
00:48:36,751 --> 00:48:40,328
to be buried next to the body
of my true and loving wife,

575
00:48:41,055 --> 00:48:43,520
Queen Jane Seymour, at Windsor.

576
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,759
You shall raise an honorable tomb,
upon which will be our effigies,

577
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:53,725
fashioned as if we are
sweetly sleeping.

578
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:59,395
Mr. Holbein awaits you
in the Chapel.

579
00:53:56,219 --> 00:53:57,469
Master Holbein,

580
00:53:59,013 --> 00:54:00,313
it is well done.

581
00:55:20,229 --> 00:55:23,681
Merci d'avoir suivi "The Tudors"
