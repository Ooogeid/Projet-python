1
00:00:01,245 --> 00:00:02,711
<i>Previously on The Tudors.</i>

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:05,505
We are come here
together to join Henry VIII

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,152
and the Lady Jane Seymour.

4
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:10,789
- <i>I think she'll make him happy.</i>
- <i>With God's help,</i>

5
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:12,971
- <i>we'll all be happy.</i>
- <i>I promise you</i>

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,348
that I'll show favor to Lady Mary.

7
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,093
The Lady Mary Tudor.

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,064
May I present you to Queen Jane.

9
00:00:19,768 --> 00:00:21,216
<i>Princess Elizabeth.</i>

10
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:23,025
Je suis en famille!

11
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:26,637
If the queen favors
the Catholic religion

12
00:00:26,804 --> 00:00:29,946
as she's rumored to do,
our Reformation is in jeopardy.

13
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,443
We must press ahead with
the dissolution of monasteries.

14
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,113
My Lord, we have to tell you
that the North

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,349
have risen in sudden rebellion.

16
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,484
We will fight, and we will die!

17
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:43,515
<i>These wretched men have threatened
my whole realm with uproar!</i>

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,432
<i>You told there was opposition,</i>

19
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,256
that people were glad
to see such places dissolved.

20
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:52,427
You were wrong.

21
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,387
<i>I'll teach these bastard ingrates</i>

22
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,295
a fearful bloody
lesson in slaughter!

23
00:01:00,962 --> 00:01:04,101
Lady Rochford, I'd like to appoint you
my principal lady in waiting.

24
00:01:04,268 --> 00:01:07,275
Madam, the King has taken
Lady Misseldon as a mistress.

25
00:01:07,677 --> 00:01:10,929
Do not be troubled for me for
I have great reason to be happy.

26
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,286
- I think you're with child.
- I am.

27
00:01:13,683 --> 00:01:16,242
<i>I want you to organize
the celebrations for my son.</i>

28
00:01:16,492 --> 00:01:18,286
I want them to be spectacular.

29
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,246
- Madam!
- Is it time?

30
00:01:20,627 --> 00:01:21,938
Yes, Your Majesty.

31
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,043
Please, don't give up!

32
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:27,629
<i>Your Majesty may have to decide soon</i>

33
00:01:28,113 --> 00:01:31,345
<i>between the life
of the mother or of the child.</i>

34
00:01:33,465 --> 00:01:36,074
Her Majesty is delivered
of a healthy son.

35
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,224
A son.

36
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:41,180
Right high, right excellent
and noble Prince Edward.

37
00:01:41,553 --> 00:01:43,520
The Queen's health
has rapidly deteriorated.

38
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,438
We've tried everything we know

39
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,129
but Her Majesty continues to weaken.

40
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:50,819
Please, God,
don't take her away from me.

41
00:01:53,484 --> 00:01:56,658
I wonder if Your Majesty could frame
your mind towards a new marriage.

42
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,869
<i>Enemy ships!
For Lord's sake, light the beacon.</i>

43
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,730
Your Majesty is beset by enemies.

44
00:02:01,897 --> 00:02:04,207
<i>Marriage to Anne of Cleves
would bring with it</i>

45
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,839
<i>the military support
of the Protestant League.</i>

46
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:08,941
Have I been used as a pawn in a game

47
00:02:09,108 --> 00:02:11,131
between your master
and the French King?

48
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,978
I've had enough, Mr. Chapuys.

49
00:02:13,257 --> 00:02:15,927
Allow me to present my companion,
Mr. Thomas Seymour,

50
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,916
- <i>brother of the Queen.</i>
- Monsieur.

51
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:19,889
We are threatened from everywhere.

52
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:21,299
Sharpen your knives.

53
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:23,143
You don't even know who I am.

54
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,037
<i>You're Edward Seymour's wife.</i>

55
00:02:25,204 --> 00:02:28,226
I thank you, Sir Francis,
in future to leave my wife alone.

56
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,336
I've warned Sir Francis Bryan
to stay away from you.

57
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,131
Well, it's a pity.

58
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:34,862
He makes me laugh.

59
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,450
<i>Mr. Holbein has sent this portrait
of Anne of Cleves.</i>

60
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,865
<i>She is pleasing.</i>

61
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,955
Sir John has written to me.

62
00:02:42,122 --> 00:02:44,831
I want to possess this woman
and I haven't even seen her.

63
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,916
Many things hang upon this marriage.

64
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,793
<i>What a pity if all should go awry.</i>

65
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,338
I'm deceived about Anne of Cleves.

66
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:55,842
She's nothing like what was reported!
She looks like a horse!

67
00:02:56,899 --> 00:02:59,387
If it were not to satisfy
the world and my realm,

68
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,265
<i>I would not do what I do
this day for no earthly thing.</i>

69
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,763
It seems to me that Cromwell
has overreached himself.

70
00:03:07,006 --> 00:03:10,771
- <i>I've found someone to amuse the King.</i>
- She is Miss Katherine Howard.

71
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:12,663
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

72
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,430
<i>I was sent to live in the household
of the Dowager Duchess.</i>

73
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:16,863
We ran a little wild.

74
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:20,301
- What do you think, Your Grace?
- She looks fit for a King.

75
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:22,904
<i>My Lord Cromwell,
you are arrested for treason.</i>

76
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:26,318
Traitor! Traitor!
Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!

77
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,177
I am no traitor!

78
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:30,376
As head of Church,
you should find proof

79
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:32,543
that the marriage
was never consummated.

80
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,698
Send a deputation to Mr. Cromwell.
Demand of him written evidence

81
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:37,335
<i>supporting my annulment.</i>

82
00:03:37,502 --> 00:03:39,364
<i>Cromwell will be humiliated.</i>

83
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:41,930
He was so ambitious
for others' blood.

84
00:03:47,368 --> 00:03:48,652
Your Majesty...

85
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:58,321

<i>to show her to the world tomorrow.</i>

00:06:00,113 --> 00:06:01,861
- Lady Rochford.
- Majesty.

103
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,186
Katherine.

104
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:54,539
Will you not come to bed,

105
00:06:55,273 --> 00:06:56,160
My Lord?

106
00:07:13,696 --> 00:07:14,696
The King!

107
00:07:46,502 --> 00:07:48,303
- My Lady.
- Your Majesty.

108
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:53,109
Who is that talking to Chapuys?

109
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,559
Norfolk's eldest son,
the Earl of Surrey.

110
00:07:56,952 --> 00:08:00,595
The Earl's been away a few years,
practicing his chivalry in France.

111
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:04,141
They say he writes poetry
and runs a little wild.

112
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:12,801
Your Grace.

113
00:08:14,235 --> 00:08:15,285
Excellency.

114
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,636
Your Grace seems distracted.

115
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:20,605
I was thinking of those
who are no longer here

116
00:08:20,772 --> 00:08:21,846
to sup with us.

117
00:08:22,743 --> 00:08:25,537
I had a moment of nostalgia
even for my enemies.

118
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:28,822
I understand Thomas Boleyn
died recently.

119
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,886
Yes. And the only mourners

120
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:33,387
at his funeral were the
ghosts of his children.

121
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:37,725
Ambassador Chapuys.

122
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:41,530
Monsieur Marillac, we are
happy accept your credentials

123
00:08:41,697 --> 00:08:43,773
from King Francis.
Welcome to our Court.

124
00:08:45,144 --> 00:08:48,069
I come here this day
to introduce to you my new wife,

125
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,565
Queen Katherine.

126
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:53,783
I was first attracted to her
by a notable appearance of honour,

127
00:08:55,672 --> 00:08:56,772
cleanness...

128
00:08:57,655 --> 00:08:59,249
and maidenly behaviour...

129
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:04,382
It seems incredible to have obtained
such a perfect jewel of womanhood

130
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:06,743
who bears towards me

131
00:09:07,428 --> 00:09:08,687
such perfect love.

132
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:13,636
A love that will not only bring me
the peace and tranquility I desire,

133
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:15,675
but may also bring forth

134
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,797
the desired fruits
of such a marriage.

135
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:28,782
- To Queen Katherine.
- Queen Katherine!

136
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,138
Now,

137
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,641
let's eat! I'm starving!

138
00:10:00,915 --> 00:10:03,656
Your Majesty,
may I introduce the Earl of Surrey.

139
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,350
We are glad to welcome you back
my Lord Surrey.

140
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:14,891
- Allow me to introduce my new wife.
- And my niece, I believe.

141
00:10:16,952 --> 00:10:17,858
My Lord.

142
00:10:19,341 --> 00:10:20,196
Sorry.

143
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:22,608
Majesty.

144
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:31,411
So, you are
the new French ambassador.

145
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:35,003
Tell me, Monsieur Marillac:
what did your King really say

146
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,849
when you told him His Majesty
had got rid of his last Queen?

147
00:10:39,534 --> 00:10:41,349
Well, he didn't say much.

148
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:45,893
He just sighed very deeply
and then he said: "Ah!"

149
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:00,625
Would you like to dance?

150
00:11:01,755 --> 00:11:02,576
Go on.

151
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:04,094
Wait.

152
00:11:36,979 --> 00:11:37,853
Majesty.

153
00:11:38,658 --> 00:11:41,233
Tell your master I was very
sad to hear about the death

154
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,035
of the Dauphin, his eldest son.

155
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,727
Majesty.

156
00:11:46,511 --> 00:11:48,754
His Majesty would like
to propose a marriage

157
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:51,821
between his second son,
Henri, Duke of Orleans,

158
00:11:52,097 --> 00:11:54,415
and your daughter, the Lady Mary.

159
00:11:56,374 --> 00:11:57,624
How often it comes around.

160
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:01,842
Forgive me.

161
00:12:02,601 --> 00:12:04,097
You're new to all of this.

162
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,501
Do you know how old she is?

163
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
Seventeen.

164
00:12:17,378 --> 00:12:19,258
Have you told your master about her?

165
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:22,640
What does he say?

166
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,328
I suppose he thinks I'm mad.

167
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:33,418
Or else he's just plain jealous.

168
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:03,616
<i> Come here, ladies!
Come and look at this!</i>

169
00:13:05,336 --> 00:13:06,952
The King sent it to me this morning.

170
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:16,811
Now, ladies...

171
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:20,178
You must promise that from now on,
as you are all sworn in,

172
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:23,010
you will all dress
in the French fashion, like me.

173
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,112
- Do you promise?
- Yes, Your Majesty!

174
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:30,721
We are more than happy
to oblige Your Majesty.

175
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,111
My Lady. You have a letter,
just delivered.

176
00:13:49,076 --> 00:13:50,126
What is it?

177
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:53,361
Oh, nothing. Just an old friend,
Joan Bulmer.

178
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:56,085
She has heard of my "great destiny"

179
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,575
and will I please now
send for her to court.

180
00:13:58,927 --> 00:14:01,708
She says that some
altered circumstances

181
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,583
have brought her
"to the utmost misery in the world

182
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,218
and a most wretched life."

183
00:14:13,315 --> 00:14:14,965
Shall you send for her?

184
00:14:17,729 --> 00:14:19,716
I shall think on it, Lady Rochford.

185
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:25,097
Now, ladies, why don't we
try on your new dresses!

186
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:30,788
<i>I'll tell you another amusing
thing about the French.</i>

187
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:33,480
To celebrate the winter
solstice in Paris,

188
00:14:33,647 --> 00:14:37,360
they build a bonfire and on the
top of it they put a barrel,

189
00:14:37,527 --> 00:14:39,101
a wheel, garlands,

190
00:14:39,268 --> 00:14:42,194
and a basket
filled with two dozen cats

191
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:44,706
and a fox to be burned alive

192
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:46,565
for the King's pleasure!

193
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,597
I actually saw King Francis himself

194
00:14:50,462 --> 00:14:54,059
light it with a torch
wrapped in red velvet.

195
00:14:54,884 --> 00:14:55,884
Of course!

196
00:14:56,786 --> 00:15:00,483
My Lord Surrey, after so long away,
how do you find the English court?

197
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:03,563
I find it full of mean creatures.

198
00:15:05,257 --> 00:15:07,781
Many of them
in the service of His Majesty.

199
00:15:09,021 --> 00:15:11,895
- Of whom do you speak?
- Those men of vile birth:

200
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,877
lawyers, university men,

201
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:17,534
Machiavellian intriguers

202
00:15:17,924 --> 00:15:20,136
whose only desire is the destruction

203
00:15:20,303 --> 00:15:22,403
of the nobility of this country.

204
00:15:23,626 --> 00:15:25,758
And I hate them...
all.

205
00:15:26,275 --> 00:15:27,927
You mean men like the Seymours?

206
00:15:28,732 --> 00:15:31,990
One cannot forget their sister
provided the King with an heir.

207
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,239
And now that you've returned,

208
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:42,259
what are your ambitions?

209
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,320
To surpass the achievements
of my father and my grandfather.

210
00:15:47,764 --> 00:15:49,958
That is a very high
ambition, my Lord.

211
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:53,402
I'm a Howard.

212
00:15:54,092 --> 00:15:55,536
It is expected of me.

213
00:15:56,082 --> 00:15:57,582
And always has been.

214
00:15:58,665 --> 00:16:00,084
And I will not fail.

215
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:07,014
- Any deer?
- No deer!

216
00:16:08,658 --> 00:16:11,927
Majesty, you've caught nothing all day,
beyond some rabbits and a deer,

217
00:16:12,094 --> 00:16:13,419
but you're still smiling.

218
00:16:13,732 --> 00:16:17,202
Have I not every reason to be happy?
You have seen the Queen.

219
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,327
Shouldn't the man that that woman
gives herself to always be happy?

220
00:16:21,494 --> 00:16:25,444
I'd say he'd be beyond happiness.
In a higher state altogether.

221
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:30,017
I feel almost
like a new man, Charles.

222
00:16:30,473 --> 00:16:33,452
I am no longer vexed by the things
that before vexed me daily.

223
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:35,705
And even my leg
is beginning to heal.

224
00:16:35,986 --> 00:16:37,893
Sex is a great medicine.

225
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,718
Indeed. You are very fortunate.

226
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:43,792
How is your Catherine?

227
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,841
She is well, although she no longer
loves me as she once did.

228
00:16:49,827 --> 00:16:52,356
- We live mostly apart.
- Take a mistress.

229
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,078
I would rather make her
love me again, if I could.

230
00:16:56,551 --> 00:16:58,670
I want to take the Queen
on a visit soon.

231
00:16:58,837 --> 00:17:01,033
I want the people
to see her as I see her.

232
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Majesty.

233
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,377
And her kinsman, Lord Surrey.

234
00:17:05,252 --> 00:17:09,166
I want to make him a cupbearer,
and give him other tokens of our esteem.

235
00:17:10,312 --> 00:17:12,448
I am sure His Lordship
will be most grateful.

236
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,718
No, My Lord. He will merely
see it as his birthright!

237
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,519
Master Culpepper!

238
00:17:18,686 --> 00:17:21,092
Come on, boy! Have them
flush us out something edible!

239
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:22,958
Yes, Majesty. Beaters!

240
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,506
Majesty. The Lady Mary.

241
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:47,113
Lady Mary.

242
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
Madam.

243
00:17:52,117 --> 00:17:54,567
It gives me such pleasure
to meet you.

244
00:18:04,391 --> 00:18:06,193
The King talks about you often,

245
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,004
no, all the time,
with such affection...

246
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,604
It is my dearest wish that you
and I may be...

247
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:18,241
kind and...

248
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,509
loving and...

249
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,592
warm to each other.

250
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:28,982
After all, Lady Mary,
you are now my stepdaughter.

251
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:39,481
I shall attend upon Your Majesty

252
00:18:39,648 --> 00:18:42,367
whenever Your Majesty
chooses to invite me.

253
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:44,707
Thank you.

254
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:51,024
Will you stay a while?
My maids have made some cakes.

255
00:18:52,992 --> 00:18:54,960
No, thank you.

256
00:18:57,671 --> 00:18:59,208
I bid you a good day.

257
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:03,609
Madam.

258
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:19,237
Your old friend is here:
Miss Joan Bulmer.

259
00:19:27,642 --> 00:19:28,667
Katherine!

260
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:36,467
Are you not the luckiest,
most fortunate woman in all the world?

261
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:40,012
- Joan, I-
- Are you not pleased to see me?

262
00:19:41,205 --> 00:19:42,805
Of course I'm pleased.

263
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,631
We used to be so close, didn't we?

264
00:19:46,128 --> 00:19:49,688
You know the unfeigned love my heart
has always borne towards you.

265
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:55,277
You are going to give me
a position, I presume?

266
00:19:56,457 --> 00:19:58,330
I may. But you must understand-

267
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,950
Otherwise I must persist
in my wretchedness.

268
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,830
In my misery.

269
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:06,997
Say you will not turn me away.

270
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:22,926
Do you remember when you know who
used to come in,

271
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,899
late at night and slip into bed?

272
00:20:27,714 --> 00:20:30,395
For God's sake,
be careful what you say.

273
00:20:35,729 --> 00:20:38,282
But you will make me
one of your ladies, won't you?

274
00:20:38,449 --> 00:20:39,571
Sweet Katherine?

275
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:48,264
My Lords, there are new reports
of disturbances in France. Sit.

276
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,972
There is a quarrel

277
00:20:55,139 --> 00:20:57,923
between the French garrison at Ardres
and our own at Guisnes.

278
00:20:58,846 --> 00:21:01,457
The French built a castle at Ardres

279
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,860
and then a bridge into
the Pale of Calais.

280
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:08,941
When our soldiers pulled it down,
the French promptly rebuilt it. Now,

281
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:11,372
I mean to show these French

282
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:14,795
that I will not shy away
from battle if I am provoked!

283
00:21:15,237 --> 00:21:18,488
For reasons which I am sending Seymour
and the Earl of Surrey to Calais.

284
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,439
They will bring with them
from the garrison, men and ordnance

285
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:25,842
and they will make a show
of force before Ardres.

286
00:21:27,215 --> 00:21:30,565
In which case the French
must either decide to desist...

287
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,373
or fight.

288
00:21:46,797 --> 00:21:48,640
- It's raining roses!
- My Lady.

289
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:52,183
Mr... Thomas Culpepper is here.

290
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:56,773
Mr Culpepper.

291
00:21:57,238 --> 00:21:59,535
Your Majesty, the King has sent me.

292
00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:01,349
Come.

293
00:22:17,824 --> 00:22:18,837
Mr Culpepper?

294
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:24,611
His Majesty wants you to know that you
will shortly accompany him on a visit

295
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:27,010
to Sir William Paget's estates
in Berkshire

296
00:22:27,177 --> 00:22:28,978
for your pastime and disport.

297
00:22:29,388 --> 00:22:31,433
I am very grateful to His Majesty

298
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,810
and I look forward
to the visit very much.

299
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,561
His Majesty also wants you to know

300
00:22:35,728 --> 00:22:38,677
that he has settled Baynard's Castle
on you as your jointure.

301
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:40,872
Where is Baynard's Castle?

302
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,015
It is here in London,
on the north bank of the Thames,

303
00:22:44,282 --> 00:22:46,811
near the Fleet Tower. You've
probably seen it from the river.

304
00:22:46,978 --> 00:22:48,428
Is it that big one?

305
00:22:48,783 --> 00:22:50,533
Yes. It's a very big one.

306
00:22:52,032 --> 00:22:54,752
In that case,
please tell His Majesty

307
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:57,555
that I am very,
very grateful to him.

308
00:22:58,227 --> 00:23:00,358
I cannot imagine owning a castle.

309
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,339
<i>Majesty, may I commend your Majesty
on taking decisive action</i>

310
00:23:06,506 --> 00:23:10,429
<i>against the French, and for honouring
my brother with a command?</i>

311
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:14,696
<i>His Majesty also desires you
to accept this gift.</i>

312
00:23:22,578 --> 00:23:24,778
Please tell His Majesty that...

313
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,717
That you're very,
very, very grateful.

314
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:31,239
Yes.

315
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:50,497
I do not know who to say this to,
Mr Culpepper.

316
00:23:51,577 --> 00:23:52,389
But,

317
00:23:54,147 --> 00:23:55,697
when I go about,

318
00:23:56,251 --> 00:23:59,873
and when I shall go
with the King on a visit,

319
00:24:00,843 --> 00:24:01,843
I am...

320
00:24:02,645 --> 00:24:04,842
not so used to everyone...

321
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:06,833
... looking at me.

322
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:09,273
And sometimes...

323
00:24:11,322 --> 00:24:12,826
wish they would not do.

324
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:18,206
My Lady, you must give men leave
to look, for they will look upon you.

325
00:24:23,711 --> 00:24:25,241
There is no help for it.

326
00:24:32,675 --> 00:24:33,680
Your Majesty.

327
00:24:39,376 --> 00:24:40,576
Lady Rochford.

328
00:24:52,308 --> 00:24:53,675
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

329
00:24:54,071 --> 00:24:55,744
<i>Hello, my Lady.</i>

330
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:58,773
<i>I love you.</i>

331
00:25:00,057 --> 00:25:01,151
<i>Kiss me.</i>

332
00:25:01,393 --> 00:25:02,393
<i>No!</i>

333
00:25:04,677 --> 00:25:06,002
<i>Please kiss me.</i>

334
00:25:06,535 --> 00:25:08,298
<i>Well, all right then.</i>

335
00:25:21,713 --> 00:25:22,729
<i>Come here.</i>

336
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,233
<i>Oh, my Lady! Oh, my Queen!</i>

337
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,864
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

338
00:27:12,878 --> 00:27:14,559
I'm going away for a while.

339
00:27:15,141 --> 00:27:17,177
Mr. Risley will supply
you with an itinerary.

340
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,744
Yes, Your Majesty.

341
00:27:19,474 --> 00:27:22,371
Also, while I'm away I intend
to call a meeting of the Council.

342
00:27:22,538 --> 00:27:25,655
Every Councillor must attend or give
very good reason why he may not.

343
00:27:25,822 --> 00:27:27,510
- Majesty.
- That's the agenda.

344
00:27:28,888 --> 00:27:29,891
Also,

345
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:34,062
while we're away I intend for work to
begin on the improvements to the palace.

346
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:38,033
There will be a new front
along the east river,

347
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,098
privy lodgings for the Lady Mary,

348
00:27:41,507 --> 00:27:43,203
and a banqueting house.

349
00:27:47,144 --> 00:27:49,844
- Damn this heat...
- Pardon, Your Majesty?

350
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,472
Tell me, my Lord,

351
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,410
who is presently kept in the Tower?

352
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:08,098
There is Lord Grey, accused
of grave misconduct in Ireland;

353
00:28:08,265 --> 00:28:10,545
Lord Lisle, the same but in Calais;

354
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:14,853
and Sir John Neville who led,
as you may remember, Your Majesty,

355
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:19,020
the recent disturbance in the north,
for which he has been arraigned.

356
00:28:19,337 --> 00:28:21,737
There is also one other
of high birth,

357
00:28:22,111 --> 00:28:24,611
namely the queen's cousin,
Lord Dacres.

358
00:28:28,771 --> 00:28:30,021
For what crime?

359
00:28:30,807 --> 00:28:34,443
Your Majesty, Lord Dacres
is a young man of 23 years,

360
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:38,584
who, along with some companions,
and after a drinking bout,

361
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:42,111
set upon an old man in a brawl
and killed him.

362
00:28:42,699 --> 00:28:45,869
His father and other members of
his family have written to Your Majesty

363
00:28:46,036 --> 00:28:49,387
begging you, for the sake of his youth,
to show mercy.

364
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,415
The first three are to be
executed whilst I'm away.

365
00:28:58,698 --> 00:29:00,448
Lord Dacres is different.

366
00:29:03,303 --> 00:29:07,186
He has besmirched his noble birth
by behaving like a common criminal.

367
00:29:08,471 --> 00:29:11,271
And so I intend he shall be
treated like one.

368
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:15,408
Have him dragged through the streets
to Tyburn

369
00:29:15,784 --> 00:29:18,484
and there hanged in public,
for all to see.

370
00:29:19,502 --> 00:29:20,992
Yes, Your Majesty.

371
00:29:28,547 --> 00:29:30,847
For God's sakes, will it ever rain?

372
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:36,006
Lady Hertford,
the Earl of Surrey, my Lady.

373
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:47,751
My Lord.

374
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,246
How may I be of assistance?

375
00:29:51,287 --> 00:29:53,787
I rather trusted to find
the Earl here.

376
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:57,850
I am leaving presently for France.

377
00:29:58,017 --> 00:30:00,090
He is a military man.
I wanted some advice.

378
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:03,926
My husband is in council
with the King.

379
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:16,711
Someone of my acquaintance
has told me about you,

380
00:30:18,966 --> 00:30:22,147
painting such a picture
of your virtues

381
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:23,721
and your talents,

382
00:30:24,947 --> 00:30:27,647
that I thought to make
myself known to you.

383
00:30:29,148 --> 00:30:30,993
I am recently returned from France

384
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,463
and I know... intimately

385
00:30:33,781 --> 00:30:35,763
so few people at court.

386
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,717
Well, Sir, now we are introduced.

387
00:30:50,272 --> 00:30:52,122
If that is what you wanted?

388
00:31:07,013 --> 00:31:10,213
I will tell my husband
that you wish to speak to him.

389
00:31:13,294 --> 00:31:14,294
Thank you.

390
00:31:18,897 --> 00:31:19,897
My Lady.

391
00:31:26,693 --> 00:31:27,743
Sir Edward!

392
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,775
These shoes must be nicely put
and always carefully attended.

393
00:31:32,942 --> 00:31:34,092
Yes, my Lady.

394
00:31:37,893 --> 00:31:39,970
Your Majesty, the King is here!

395
00:31:40,257 --> 00:31:41,257
Oh my!

396
00:31:48,434 --> 00:31:51,659
Sweetheart, there are two people
come to be introduced to you.

397
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:54,787
- Lady Bryan.
- Your Majesty.

398
00:31:56,133 --> 00:31:57,790
This is my son, Prince Edward.

399
00:31:58,171 --> 00:31:59,535
Come forward, child.

400
00:32:00,737 --> 00:32:02,837
This is my new Queen, Katherine.

401
00:32:03,557 --> 00:32:06,222
- Say hello to her.
- Hello, Your Majesty.

402
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:10,340
Oh, he's such a sweet boy!

403
00:32:11,337 --> 00:32:14,672
Hello, Your Grace.
I am so delighted to meet you.

404
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,148
Thank you.

405
00:32:16,315 --> 00:32:19,238
Is he well? Eating well?
How does the heat affect him?

406
00:32:19,493 --> 00:32:22,613
Even though it is so hot he must always
be wrapped up against any sudden chills.

407
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,211
He is very well and healthy,

408
00:32:24,378 --> 00:32:27,028
and every care that could be taken
is taken for his better comfort.

409
00:32:27,836 --> 00:32:31,034
On the other hand,
don't spoil him too much!

410
00:32:35,544 --> 00:32:36,544
Go on.

411
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:40,256
- And be a good boy, do you hear?
- Thank you, sir.

412
00:32:40,614 --> 00:32:42,043
Good day, Madam.

413
00:32:52,277 --> 00:32:53,727
Welcome, Elizabeth.

414
00:32:57,988 --> 00:33:00,282
This is my daughter,
the Lady Elizabeth.

415
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:06,190
Your Majesty, I am honoured
to be presented to you

416
00:33:06,357 --> 00:33:08,611
and wish you every
joy and happiness.

417
00:33:10,631 --> 00:33:13,992
It is also an honour for me
to meet you, Lady Elizabeth.

418
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:17,383
You are a very pretty young lady.

419
00:33:17,683 --> 00:33:19,033
Thank you, Madam.

420
00:33:20,938 --> 00:33:22,594
I want to give you these.

421
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:28,660
They are of not much value,
but will remind you of me.

422
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,509
Your Majesty is very generous.

423
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,261
I will always cherish it.

424
00:33:34,424 --> 00:33:35,574
Your Majesty.

425
00:33:51,952 --> 00:33:54,324
Carry on packing;
we depart tomorrow.

426
00:33:55,955 --> 00:33:56,955
Madam.

427
00:34:05,473 --> 00:34:06,715
Now, Mr. Risley.

428
00:34:06,882 --> 00:34:08,888
The death warrants,
my Lord Hertford.

429
00:34:11,622 --> 00:34:12,622
Lord Grey.

430
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:16,095
Lord Lisle. Sir John Neville.

431
00:34:18,186 --> 00:34:19,703
And Lord Dacres.

432
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,872
I pity him for his youth.

433
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,066
They say the judges wept
when they read his sentence.

434
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:32,654
God save us, Mr Risley,
from weeping judges.

435
00:34:37,871 --> 00:34:38,871
My Lord.

436
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,470
Did Surrey speak to
you before he left?

437
00:34:48,637 --> 00:34:52,414
No. Since his return the Earl
has made it plain to all who will listen

438
00:34:52,581 --> 00:34:54,731
that he despises us as "new men."

439
00:34:57,173 --> 00:34:59,641
I don't suppose that
he would deal with you?

440
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,681
Perhaps.

441
00:35:04,781 --> 00:35:06,431
Why is it so important?

442
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:10,005
Surrey is heir to a great
title and a great fortune.

443
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,422
His family have royal blood.

444
00:35:14,141 --> 00:35:17,441
Surely even you can see
the merits of dealing with him.

445
00:35:56,638 --> 00:35:57,910
Sir William?

446
00:35:58,077 --> 00:36:00,542
The Queen and I thank you
for your most lavish hospitality.

447
00:36:00,765 --> 00:36:02,452
Your Majesty is most gracious.

448
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:06,602
We are so honoured that you and
your Queen have chosen to visit us.

449
00:36:21,285 --> 00:36:22,385
Sir Richard.

450
00:36:22,552 --> 00:36:25,224
Your Majesty, I just came from court.
We've had news from France.

451
00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:36,068
Apparently, soon after I arrived,
Sir Thomas Seymour and Lord Surrey,

452
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:39,614
as you commanded, made warlike
preparations and showed their strength,

453
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,359
and afterwards made overtures
to the French governor.

454
00:36:42,526 --> 00:36:46,176
Some gifts were exchanged and the French
were invited to watch a wrestling match.

455
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,965
And where, until recently, nothing

456
00:36:49,132 --> 00:36:51,108
but war had been talked of.

457
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:53,926
Now, there is no mention

458
00:36:54,325 --> 00:36:56,425
but of wishing to live at peace.

459
00:36:57,564 --> 00:36:59,276
Then it was all well done.

460
00:36:59,925 --> 00:37:02,512
And yet, Sir Richard,
something inside me is disappointed.

461
00:37:03,085 --> 00:37:04,635
It hungers for a war.

462
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,715
I have known its mad
excitements only once,

463
00:37:09,157 --> 00:37:11,023
that was a long time ago.

464
00:37:12,989 --> 00:37:13,989
Funny.

465
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:17,819
You know, I actually thought
the French might oblige me this time.

466
00:37:23,424 --> 00:37:24,242
Majesty.

467
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,030
Are you happy?

468
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:26,474
Do you have everything you want,
everything you need?

469
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,829
Tell me.

470
00:38:27,996 --> 00:38:30,157
Yes, everything.

471
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:38,768
There is one thing.

472
00:38:40,296 --> 00:38:41,346
What is it?

473
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:44,162
It's just that...

474
00:38:45,732 --> 00:38:48,482
the Lady Mary doesn't
treat me with respect.

475
00:38:49,421 --> 00:38:51,582
And I think she ought to, don't you?

476
00:38:52,387 --> 00:38:54,398
She will. Believe me.

477
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,320
Give her time.

478
00:38:58,984 --> 00:39:00,713
All this is new to her,

479
00:39:01,493 --> 00:39:03,258
but she will grow used to you.

480
00:39:04,323 --> 00:39:06,173
And then she will love you.

481
00:39:09,017 --> 00:39:10,017
I hope so.

482
00:39:22,537 --> 00:39:25,407
I'm tired. I'm very tired.

483
00:39:27,142 --> 00:39:28,992
I have a long day tomorrow.

484
00:39:34,584 --> 00:39:36,038
Good night, sweetheart.

485
00:39:41,272 --> 00:39:42,322
Sleep well.

486
00:39:51,081 --> 00:39:52,763
Good night, Your Majesty.

487
00:39:56,545 --> 00:39:58,006
Good night, my Lady.

488
00:40:24,518 --> 00:40:25,518
Joan!

489
00:40:26,038 --> 00:40:28,688
- What is it?
- Don't worry. I won't stay.

490
00:40:29,247 --> 00:40:30,747
I just want to talk.

491
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:32,768
About what?

492
00:40:36,621 --> 00:40:38,704
This is how it used to be, remember?

493
00:40:39,155 --> 00:40:40,439
You and me together.

494
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,882
I told you to mind what you say.

495
00:40:46,294 --> 00:40:47,827
I'm only talking to you.

496
00:40:55,571 --> 00:40:58,071
And then, the two of them
would come in,

497
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:01,667
the one for you, and the other mine.

498
00:41:02,552 --> 00:41:05,352
And all that puffing
and blowing in the dark.

499
00:41:06,938 --> 00:41:10,942
And you and him would kiss and hang
by your bellies like two sparrows.

500
00:41:12,605 --> 00:41:14,305
There was no harm in it.

501
00:41:14,718 --> 00:41:17,118
We were agreed
we were to be married.

502
00:41:18,533 --> 00:41:20,583
Is that what you told the King?

503
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:22,396
Don't be stupid.

504
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:25,142
I don't need to tell him
anything about...

505
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:26,894
what happened before.

506
00:41:28,435 --> 00:41:31,308
And if you talk of it to anyone

507
00:41:31,475 --> 00:41:33,532
- I swear I'll...
- Hush. Hush.

508
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,119
Do you suppose I don't like being
at court, like a special person?

509
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,986
Then swear on your honour,
and hope to die,

510
00:41:40,337 --> 00:41:42,230
that you will speak of it to nobody,

511
00:41:42,397 --> 00:41:44,615
not even any of my other ladies.

512
00:41:45,993 --> 00:41:47,393
Yes, Your Majesty.

513
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:54,970
I do so swear.

514
00:41:59,303 --> 00:42:00,303
Honestly.

515
00:42:02,362 --> 00:42:03,362
Good.

516
00:42:04,536 --> 00:42:06,190
Now go back to bed.

517
00:42:26,854 --> 00:42:28,453
And do you remember this?

518
00:42:36,477 --> 00:42:37,852
I am Queen now.

519
00:42:41,042 --> 00:42:42,568
Do as I command.

520
00:42:46,539 --> 00:42:50,289
How very obliging of Sir William
to open his cellar for us.

521
00:42:50,456 --> 00:42:53,131
I rather thought, Sir Edward,
that it was you who opened it.

522
00:42:53,298 --> 00:42:54,974
Well, I was thirsty!

523
00:42:55,224 --> 00:42:56,274
I still am!

524
00:42:57,026 --> 00:42:58,763
By God she's wanton.

525
00:42:59,241 --> 00:43:00,241
Who is?

526
00:43:00,865 --> 00:43:02,511
You know very well who I mean.

527
00:43:02,678 --> 00:43:05,167
Queen Katherine.
She's a little fireball.

528
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:07,533
Too hot for you, Mr. Culpepper.

529
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:11,297
Really?

530
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:19,597
Tell me you can't imagine her
without her clothes on.

531
00:43:21,528 --> 00:43:23,100
Just picture her naked body.

532
00:43:25,204 --> 00:43:26,606
Those breasts.

533
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:32,048
Those thighs.
That sweet plump little arse.

534
00:43:37,224 --> 00:43:38,501
Holy Jesus.

535
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:43,060
All those things belong to the King.

536
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:58,249
I bid you gentlemen good night.

537
00:44:03,005 --> 00:44:04,440
And if I were you,

538
00:44:04,961 --> 00:44:08,411
I would not outstay your welcome
in Sir William's kitchen.

539
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,406
I can't drink enough
to banish the thoughts of her.

540
00:44:18,038 --> 00:44:20,741
Tomorrow let's go out
and find something

541
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,433
to quench that thirst.

542
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,052
- Ho there!
- Sir, a good day.

543
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,219
And to you. And who are you?

544
00:45:25,477 --> 00:45:27,433
The wife of the park-keeper, sir.

545
00:45:28,222 --> 00:45:31,572
- And where is your husband?
- He's away at a fair, sir.

546
00:45:33,677 --> 00:45:36,063
- Anyone else here? Your children?
- No, sir.

547
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,356
I had a daughter, sir, but she died.

548
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,237
There's no one else here.

549
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,492
Can I help you, sir?

550
00:45:49,448 --> 00:45:51,120
You can do me a great favour,

551
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:53,709
and it will please you too.

552
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,169
Oh no, sir!

553
00:45:55,975 --> 00:45:57,406
Do you know who I am?

554
00:45:58,036 --> 00:46:00,320
A gentleman of the Privy Chamber.

555
00:46:00,487 --> 00:46:02,086
I serve the King.

556
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,510
- Now, let's go inside.
- No!

557
00:46:06,683 --> 00:46:09,374
If, as you say, you are a gentleman,

558
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:12,062
then you would not try
to force me against my will.

559
00:46:12,229 --> 00:46:14,919
You would just leave,
as I ask you to.

560
00:46:23,224 --> 00:46:24,224
Come on!

561
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:27,386
This way! Around back!

562
00:46:28,938 --> 00:46:30,485
Come on, little chicken!

563
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,328
Come on, boys!

564
00:46:39,495 --> 00:46:40,993
Leave me alone!

565
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,460
Look at her run!

566
00:46:44,544 --> 00:46:45,844
You'll enjoy it!

567
00:46:46,915 --> 00:46:48,214
Take her!

568
00:46:48,748 --> 00:46:51,017
Come on now. Easy.

569
00:46:51,612 --> 00:46:52,928
Hold her still.

570
00:47:13,951 --> 00:47:15,278
Who are you, there?

571
00:47:15,716 --> 00:47:18,230
Mr. Roper, sir. The park-keeper.

572
00:47:19,951 --> 00:47:21,093
Mr. Roper.

573
00:47:23,346 --> 00:47:25,050
What on earth do you want with me?

574
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,595
You know very well what I want, sir.

575
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:29,396
I want justice.

576
00:47:30,425 --> 00:47:31,956
I know what you've done.

577
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,887
I have come to take
you to the Sheriff.

578
00:47:35,906 --> 00:47:38,454
- Come, sir.
- Don't you dare touch me.

579
00:47:38,623 --> 00:47:40,404
You should know your betters.

580
00:47:42,087 --> 00:47:44,010
Now go back to your pigsty.

581
00:47:46,276 --> 00:47:47,364
I will go, sir,

582
00:47:47,753 --> 00:47:50,033
and fetch the Sheriff myself,

583
00:47:50,429 --> 00:47:52,934
whose justice is better than yours!

584
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,659
I would rather not
trouble the Sheriff.

585
00:47:59,584 --> 00:48:01,378
How much do you want
for your silence?

586
00:48:02,898 --> 00:48:04,048
Come on, man.

587
00:48:05,128 --> 00:48:06,717
What real harm was done?

588
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:09,154
Take a gold crown,

589
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:12,598
enough to buy a dozen pigs,
and forget the whole matter.

590
00:48:13,029 --> 00:48:14,183
No, sir.

591
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,018
For the shame would still be there

592
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:17,975
in my wife's eyes.

593
00:48:18,617 --> 00:48:19,867
And in my soul.

594
00:48:40,748 --> 00:48:42,248
Damn you for a fool.

595
00:49:00,439 --> 00:49:03,439
I have to say I was surprised
at your invitation.

596
00:49:04,134 --> 00:49:05,252
Really?

597
00:49:05,781 --> 00:49:09,331
I had imagined that very little
would surprise you, my Lord.

598
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:15,780
It is true that I have seen
most things in my life.

599
00:49:17,629 --> 00:49:20,579
But I find that people
can always be surprising.

600
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:25,837
I invited you here because
I want us to be friends.

601
00:49:30,214 --> 00:49:31,677
What kind of friends?

602
00:49:34,034 --> 00:49:36,181
Good friends.

603
00:49:43,427 --> 00:49:45,065
Who wants to be cursed?

604
00:49:47,258 --> 00:49:49,658
People are good
when they are afraid.

605
00:49:53,571 --> 00:49:55,421
When they are not afraid...

606
00:49:55,972 --> 00:49:57,522
they can be anything.

607
00:49:59,959 --> 00:50:01,407
I am not afraid.

608
00:50:03,186 --> 00:50:04,976
I will never be afraid.

609
00:50:54,765 --> 00:50:56,274
Katherine Howard!

610
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,610
Your Majesty!

611
00:51:14,647 --> 00:51:16,073
My Councillors are arriving.

612
00:51:20,163 --> 00:51:21,411
Then I'd better wash.

613
00:51:22,118 --> 00:51:23,118
Yes.

614
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,867
Gentlemen. My Lords.

615
00:51:51,235 --> 00:51:52,986
What is your report,
my Lord Hertford?

616
00:51:53,153 --> 00:51:56,071
Your Majesty, there was a small
outbreak of plague in the city

617
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:58,953
during your absence,
which now has abated, thank God.

618
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,913
The building works Your Majesty
requested have all commenced.

619
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:06,081
The executions of Lords Grey and Lisle,
of Sir John Neville and Lord Dacres

620
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:09,909
have all been carried out in accordance
with Your Majesty's wishes.

621
00:52:10,826 --> 00:52:11,628
Sit.

622
00:52:15,153 --> 00:52:16,153
My Lords.

623
00:52:16,778 --> 00:52:20,178
I refer to the 500 men kept in prison
on suspicion of heresy.

624
00:52:21,402 --> 00:52:24,798
It is my desire that they should be
pardoned and therefore released.

625
00:52:26,471 --> 00:52:28,478
Your Majesty shows
remarkable charity.

626
00:52:30,756 --> 00:52:31,815
Why should I not?

627
00:52:32,798 --> 00:52:34,110
Does our Lord not commend us

628
00:52:34,277 --> 00:52:37,215
to never to let mercy and faithfulness
depart from us?

629
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,400
How is my boy?

630
00:52:41,584 --> 00:52:44,161
Prince Edward is very well,
Your Majesty.

631
00:52:46,365 --> 00:52:47,497
King Francis

632
00:52:47,896 --> 00:52:50,709
has formally proposed
a marriage contract between his son,

633
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,943
Henri, Duc of Orleans,
and Lady Mary.

634
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:58,356
We do not, and cannot
trust the intentions of King Francis

635
00:52:58,523 --> 00:53:01,303
and still think he means
to invade this realm.

636
00:53:02,488 --> 00:53:06,135
Events at Calais were{\ just} a preliminary
exercise to test our resolve.

637
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,354
In which case we must continue
to look to our defences

638
00:53:09,521 --> 00:53:10,900
and favour the Emperor.

639
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:14,512
Now, to the subject
of Queen Katherine.

640
00:53:16,815 --> 00:53:19,674
It is my intention to settle upon her
all the lands and manors

641
00:53:19,841 --> 00:53:22,015
which formerly belonged
to Jane Seymour.

642
00:53:23,095 --> 00:53:26,536
Furthermore, some lands and properties
formerly in the possession

643
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:29,645
of Thomas Cromwell
are also to be settled upon her.

644
00:53:29,993 --> 00:53:32,710
Her badges and emblems
are to be set up in all palaces,

645
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:36,546
replacing all others, and henceforth
she is in all ways to be treated

646
00:53:36,935 --> 00:53:38,379
as the Queen of England.

647
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:47,806
Hush!

648
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:49,160
What is it?

649
00:53:50,466 --> 00:53:51,466
Listen.

650
00:53:54,176 --> 00:53:55,576
Can you hear that?

651
00:53:57,675 --> 00:53:58,675
It's...

652
00:53:59,507 --> 00:54:00,819
It's raining!

653
00:54:02,471 --> 00:54:03,791
It's raining!

654
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:09,126
Katherine, where are you going?

655
00:54:09,364 --> 00:54:11,140
It's raining! Henry!
