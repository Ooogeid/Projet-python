<i>Previously on The Tudors...</i>

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:05,358
There's been too many incursions over
the border from Scotland into England.

3
00:00:05,525 --> 00:00:07,907
I want you to deal with my cousin,
the King of the Scots,

4
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:11,532
to ensure that the Scots
cease their... impertinence.

5
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:13,096
I haven't seen you for a while.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,308
I trust you found something
to amuse yourself when I was away?

7
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:19,144
I missed your Majesty so much.

8
00:00:20,263 --> 00:00:23,273
I was just thinking of those
who are no longer here to sup with us.

9
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,713
I had a moment of nostalgia
even for my enemies.

10
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:29,904
We must agree on these plans for
our much-delayed progress to the North.

11
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,329
We shall take men-at-arms-since we mean
to visit those parts of our realm

12
00:00:33,496 --> 00:00:37,324
which, not long ago, rose up
in treacherous rebellion against us.

13
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:40,097
You promise never again
to make unlawful assembly.

14
00:00:40,264 --> 00:00:42,751
In return, his Majesty
will grant you mercy.

15
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,210
Your son, Edward.

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,920
I can see your mother in you.

17
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,778
Do you know who she was?

18
00:00:48,606 --> 00:00:50,151
This is her.

19
00:00:51,074 --> 00:00:52,774
And this is her thimble.

20
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,536
You're a good boy.

21
00:00:54,963 --> 00:00:57,541
Katherine, I've come to tell you
we're leaving in two days.

22
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,897
- Mary will be accompanying us.
- Must she come?

23
00:01:00,064 --> 00:01:03,576
Mary is a much-loved figure in the North
where we mean to impress our subjects.

24
00:01:03,743 --> 00:01:05,899
The decision has nothing
to do with you.

25
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:10,070
There were these 2 gallants, they found
a way to call upon Katherine and me.

26
00:01:10,486 --> 00:01:12,572
- Katherine with this Francis Dereham?
- Yes!

27
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,741
- What then?
- They would be kissing.

28
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,495
And the two of them would hang
by their bellies like two sparrows.

29
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:20,580
I want to see him again.

30
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:23,375
I only urge your Majesty
to be careful.

31
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,285
What? Don't you think I know
how to meddle with a man?

32
00:01:26,452 --> 00:01:28,268
I wanted to visit the Queen tonight.

33
00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:32,120
She looked so pure and beautiful
today, don't you think?

34
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:34,993

{\a3}Sir Ralph, my lords and gentlemen,

I thank God at last, I've been able
to come among my faithful servants

48
00:03:54,508 --> 00:03:56,265
in Yorkshire and the North.

49
00:03:57,146 --> 00:03:59,072
Allow me to introduce my wife,

{\a3}Queen Katherine.

51
00:04:00,555 --> 00:04:01,705
{\a3}Your Majesty.

52
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,392
And you know my eldest daughter,
the Lady Mary.

53
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,083
My Lady.

54
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,172
Your Majesties,
and all those with you,

55
00:04:10,531 --> 00:04:12,681
are welcome to Pontefract Castle.

56
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:16,464
I trust your stay here will bring you
both pleasure and profit.

57
00:04:21,955 --> 00:04:24,142
- Sir Ralph.
- Your Majesty.

58
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,140
Culpepper!

59
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,445
I will sleep with the Queen tonight.
Bring her to me.

60
00:04:32,612 --> 00:04:33,612
Majesty.

61
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:35,933
The King seems in good spirits,
your Grace.

62
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,155
His Majesty is very well, Sir Ralph.

63
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:40,982
He has both a new Queen
and it seems a new lease on life.

64
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:44,064
His progress here has been joyful.
Crowds have come out to cheer him.

65
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:46,218
Eminent men have made
speeches to praise him.

66
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:48,447
There will be men come here too
now and in a while,

67
00:04:48,614 --> 00:04:51,749
who once wore the emblem of rebellion
came now to express their shame for it.

68
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:56,963
Welcome back to Pontefract
Castle, your Grace.

69
00:05:02,995 --> 00:05:04,045
Forgive me.

70
00:05:04,925 --> 00:05:07,755
These walls must remind
your Grace of other times.

71
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:09,392
They do.

72
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,910
I must confess to you, Sir Ralph,

73
00:05:12,803 --> 00:05:16,774
this hall is filled with ghostly
presences that I should rather forget.

74
00:05:17,782 --> 00:05:18,882
For me, too.

75
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:21,685
I know he was an arch traitor,

76
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:24,455
but my Lord Darcy-Old Tom-

77
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,619
he still seems to haunt
these battlements.

78
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,204
I half expect to see him
on my way to bed.

79
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:31,815
Tell me, truly.

80
00:05:33,142 --> 00:05:35,255
How do the people cope
without their saints,

81
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:37,253
their superstitions,
their monasteries?

82
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:39,398
There are some-a few-

83
00:05:39,565 --> 00:05:42,229
who still grumble at the empty
niches in the churches,

84
00:05:42,396 --> 00:05:44,761
the absence of candles
and prayers for the dead.

85
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,571
But it seems with the death
of Secretary Cromwell

86
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:49,941
that the reforming zeal
has slackened.

87
00:05:51,687 --> 00:05:52,687
Or has it?

88
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,249
No one knows whether the King means
to continue stripping the altars,

89
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,359
or return to the old ways.

90
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,737
They're afraid to open their mouths,
in case they should say the wrong thing.

91
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:06,094
It is not always easy to read
the King's mind, Sir Ralph.

92
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:13,449
Majesty.

93
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:23,551
My Lady.

94
00:06:28,148 --> 00:06:30,252
- Lady Rochford.
- Master Culpepper.

95
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:39,440
His Majesty is ready to receive you.

96
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:47,073
Later?

97
00:06:57,331 --> 00:06:59,511
Your Majesty, the Queen is here.

98
00:07:04,316 --> 00:07:05,466
Your Majesty.

99
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,221
The Emperor and the King of France
are on the brink of war.

100
00:07:13,905 --> 00:07:16,262
Surely your Majesty
does not want to see me...

101
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:18,146
at such a time.

102
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:21,190
Why?

103
00:07:22,263 --> 00:07:23,263
Because...

104
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,211
you have more important matters.

105
00:07:30,462 --> 00:07:32,162
More important than you?

106
00:07:34,403 --> 00:07:35,403
Yes.

107
00:07:58,101 --> 00:07:59,801
Let them have their war.

108
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,954
Do you know who died here,
in this castle?

109
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,895
Plenty, I suspect.

110
00:08:38,062 --> 00:08:39,894
No. Important men.

111
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:41,437
No.

112
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,982
Richard the Second died here,
after he was deposed.

113
00:08:45,652 --> 00:08:47,401
He was 33 years of age.

114
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:50,363
They kept him here as a prisoner.
They starved him to death.

115
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,320
Poor ghost.

116
00:08:52,768 --> 00:08:56,327
He made the mistake of favouring
lesser men over greater ones.

117
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:00,463
For such mean creatures

118
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:04,012
are determined not just
to usurp the nobility,

119
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:06,462
but to destroy us altogether.

120
00:09:09,158 --> 00:09:12,165
Sometimes, my Lord, it may be so.

121
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,480
But surely the King is right

122
00:09:15,647 --> 00:09:19,225
where he gives offices and dignities
to those with the right qualities?

123
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:21,709
No.

124
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,449
Those men that are made
by the King of vile birth

125
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:29,107
have been the distraction
of all the nobility of this realm!

126
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,216
And if God calls away the King,

127
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:35,096
they will suffer for it!

128
00:09:35,263 --> 00:09:36,263
My Lord,

129
00:09:37,151 --> 00:09:39,328
be careful not to wish
the King's life away.

130
00:09:40,555 --> 00:09:41,855
That is treason!

131
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,810
Sir Thomas,

132
00:09:48,603 --> 00:09:51,131
I think your friend Surrey
is snarling at you.

133
00:11:37,211 --> 00:11:38,572
His Majesty, the King!

134
00:12:03,574 --> 00:12:05,374
Mr. Sidwell, your Majesty.

135
00:12:08,255 --> 00:12:11,605
Your Majesty, we
your humble servants

136
00:12:12,157 --> 00:12:13,975
confess that we wretches

137
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,693
have most grievously, wantonly,

138
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,329
and heinously offended Your Majesty

139
00:12:20,758 --> 00:12:23,199
in the most unnatural, odious,

140
00:12:23,366 --> 00:12:25,543
and distasteful acts

141
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,279
of outrageous disobedience

142
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:30,172
and traitorous rebellion.

143
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:33,445
We beg your Majesty to rid your mind

144
00:12:33,612 --> 00:12:35,877
of any relics of indignation

145
00:12:36,044 --> 00:12:38,132
you might still harbour against us,

146
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:40,895
and we pray henceforward

147
00:12:41,229 --> 00:12:43,935
to pray ceaselessly
for your preservation,

148
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:48,240
and for that of your queen and
of your son, the Prince Edward,

149
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,835
so God Almighty help us!

150
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:00,417
I harbour

151
00:13:01,492 --> 00:13:03,892
no relics of indignation
against you.

152
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:06,865
And for these shows of loyalty

153
00:13:08,535 --> 00:13:11,957
I forgive you all
your trespasses against us.

154
00:13:20,177 --> 00:13:21,627
Long live the King!

155
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:27,029

Joan?

159
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:49,883
What time...

160
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:51,309
Look.

161
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:58,860
<i>God bless Lady Mary!</i>

162
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:03,737
<i>I want you to say a prayer for
his Grace, the King's Majesty.</i>

163
00:14:04,306 --> 00:14:07,094
We pray for his Majesty's
long and blessed reign

164
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:08,931
and for his good health.

165
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,975
In the name of the Blessed Virgin

166
00:14:11,387 --> 00:14:14,891
whose only Son died
in agony for our sins.

167
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:18,501
In the name of the Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost,

168
00:14:18,965 --> 00:14:20,947
I bless all of you.

169
00:14:22,936 --> 00:14:24,196
All shall be well.

170
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,659

174
00:14:51,795 --> 00:14:52,845
A woodcock.

175
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:55,549
Good choice, Because...

176
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,147
it's a cock.

177
00:15:00,227 --> 00:15:01,277
What is it?

178
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's him!

179
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:13,017
It is him, isn't it?

180
00:15:13,202 --> 00:15:15,164
Mr. Francis Dereham, your Majesty.

181
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,189
Your Majesty.

182
00:15:30,003 --> 00:15:31,088
Mr. Dereham.

183
00:15:31,255 --> 00:15:33,766
Francis, please, Your Majesty.

184
00:15:34,856 --> 00:15:37,853
- Why have you come here?
- I came to give you this.

185
00:15:38,173 --> 00:15:39,173
What is it? -

186
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,565
A letter of recommendation
from the Dowager Duchess.

187
00:15:42,586 --> 00:15:45,110
You remember the Duchess,
don't you, your Majesty?

188
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:49,532
Why do you need such a letter?

189
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:52,785
I believe such a thing is obligatory
if one is seeking employment.

190
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,619
When you read it, you will see
that since we last met

191
00:15:56,786 --> 00:16:00,655
I have held a number of responsible
positions in the Duchess's household,

192
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:03,326
for which she freely commends me.

193
00:16:05,926 --> 00:16:08,878
It is not possible for me
to offer you employment...

194
00:16:10,298 --> 00:16:11,303
Francis.

195
00:16:14,489 --> 00:16:15,515
But why not?

196
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:18,699
You must keep a large establishment.

197
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:20,895
But do you have a secretary?

198
00:16:21,062 --> 00:16:23,148
I would make an excellent secretary.

199
00:16:23,635 --> 00:16:26,777
Surely you can understand
why I cannot offer you anything?

200
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:30,197
But you employed Joan Bulmer,
didn't you?

201
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:32,569
And she knows what I know, so...

202
00:16:33,502 --> 00:16:34,937
what is the difference?

203
00:16:36,084 --> 00:16:39,118
I was bound to notice
that one of your ladies announced me.

204
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,778
Does that mean you have
no usher for your chamber?

205
00:16:41,945 --> 00:16:43,808
I am very sure you ought to,

206
00:16:44,217 --> 00:16:45,802
considering who you are.

207
00:16:48,214 --> 00:16:49,214
I can't...

208
00:16:50,936 --> 00:16:53,150
But you can, your Majesty.

209
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56,437
You are, after all,
the Queen of England.

210
00:16:57,722 --> 00:16:59,212
You can do as you will.

211
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:05,394
All right.

212
00:17:05,831 --> 00:17:07,881
Just take care what words you speak!

213
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:09,927
Your Majesty.

214
00:17:24,616 --> 00:17:26,680
Your Majesty, the French Ambassador.

215
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,498
- Excellency!
- Your Majesty.

216
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,762
You will not forget to convey
to your master what you've seen here.

217
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,042
Thousands of former rebels

218
00:17:37,209 --> 00:17:39,350
offering their supplication
to their anointed King!

219
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,187
I will, of course, convey
these tremendous events to his Majesty.

220
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:46,106
No. You will tell him,
based on what you have seen,

221
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:50,361
that it would be foolish to contemplate
an invasion of this island

222
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,780
in the mistaken belief
that it is riven

223
00:17:53,162 --> 00:17:56,408
with religious discord
and full of discontented men.

224
00:17:57,517 --> 00:18:01,508
Majesty, I am very sure
that my master has no such plans.

225
00:18:02,528 --> 00:18:05,459
On the contrary, he regards
England as his natural ally

226
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,106
against the Emperor.

227
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:16,589
Good,

228
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,346
Excellency.

229
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:28,141
Your Grace, what preparations
are made for our visit to York?

230
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:29,416
Majesty,

231
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,535
chambers are being made ready
in the former abbey of St. Mary,

232
00:18:33,052 --> 00:18:35,864
and furnished with your tapestries
and plate brought from London.

233
00:18:36,418 --> 00:18:40,162
Tents are being erected in the Abbey
grounds to accommodate your court

234
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:42,574
and that of King James's court
when he arrives.

235
00:18:42,741 --> 00:18:43,741
Good.

236
00:18:45,021 --> 00:18:46,542
Sweetheart, how are you?

237
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,469
I am well, thank you,

238
00:18:48,723 --> 00:18:49,873
Your Majesty.

239
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:54,263
I must tell your Majesty

240
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,429
that today I appointed a new Private
Secretary and Usher to my Chambers.

241
00:19:03,578 --> 00:19:04,643
What?

242
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,571
Will you write letters now?

243
00:19:07,845 --> 00:19:09,857
- You don't mind?
- Of course not.

244
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,115
I've told you.
You must do what you will.

245
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,281
Thank you.

246
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:19,569
Uncle.

247
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:21,985
Uncle.

248
00:19:26,922 --> 00:19:28,584
Madam, your good health!

249
00:19:32,026 --> 00:19:33,626
Thank you, your Grace.

250
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,339
Hello, Joan.

251
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,675
Just like old times, eh?

252
00:20:19,163 --> 00:20:20,163
No.

253
00:20:21,371 --> 00:20:23,972
These times is different, Francis.
You know that very well.

254
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:25,964
Just imagine, Joanie!

255
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:29,031
Our Kate, our little Katie
is Queen of England.

256
00:20:30,308 --> 00:20:32,227
She's not our Kate anymore.

257
00:20:33,554 --> 00:20:36,161
She belongs to him.
She belongs to the King

258
00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:38,028
And don't you forget it.

259
00:20:38,745 --> 00:20:41,281
Don't you ever get any ideas
into that mind of yours.

260
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:43,356
What kind of ideas?

261
00:20:44,191 --> 00:20:46,841
You know very well
what I'm talking about.

262
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,571
Those days are over, Francis.

263
00:20:50,238 --> 00:20:51,276
They're dead!

264
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:53,727
This is a good living.

265
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:57,923
This is the highest living
you or I could ever dream of!

266
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,059
For God's sake, don't spoil it.

267
00:21:04,572 --> 00:21:06,376
Not for us and not for her!

268
00:21:08,928 --> 00:21:09,928
So,

269
00:21:10,746 --> 00:21:12,187
where am I to sleep?

270
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:14,973
Not here.

271
00:21:15,627 --> 00:21:16,817
Not with us!

272
00:21:18,248 --> 00:21:19,695
For heaven's sake,

273
00:21:20,023 --> 00:21:22,114
you must ask the King's
chamberlain for a place.

274
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:25,346
Do you understand?

275
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:26,663
I suppose so.

276
00:21:37,568 --> 00:21:38,668
What's that?

277
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:40,483
Just a kiss.

278
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:43,169
For old times' sake!

279
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:05,272
Who's there?

280
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:37,181
My Lord Darcy.

281
00:22:42,249 --> 00:22:43,299
Your Grace.

282
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:02,262
You're dead.

283
00:23:03,085 --> 00:23:05,463
Yes, but not yet at rest.

284
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,081
The living don't know

285
00:23:08,248 --> 00:23:10,760
that the recent dead
are always around them.

286
00:23:11,293 --> 00:23:13,944
We go here and there, to do penance,

287
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,973
to make sure our relatives are well,

288
00:23:17,757 --> 00:23:19,998
while we await our second death.

289
00:23:21,694 --> 00:23:23,320
Why do you appear to me?

290
00:23:23,747 --> 00:23:25,138
I am among the Dead.

291
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:30,075
I have joined the ghosts
of all your victims, your Grace.

292
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:34,072
But do not grieve too much,
for they are not bitter.

293
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:38,742
Even the children think of nothing
but stopping this endless motion,

294
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:40,335
this rushing here and there,

295
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,679
like doubles of our earthly selves.

296
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:46,738
And when we have settled
all our accounts,

297
00:23:48,323 --> 00:23:51,102
the angels will come to take us

298
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,631
to the place of rest.

299
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,862
I wish you had not bothered me.

300
00:23:57,985 --> 00:23:59,902
But now I would not have you go.

301
00:24:01,954 --> 00:24:03,782
I am not really here.

302
00:24:05,575 --> 00:24:06,925
But I can see you

303
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:08,597
and hear you.

304
00:24:09,851 --> 00:24:12,196
You are... Darcy.

305
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:13,735
I am not Darcy!

306
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:15,579
I am nothing!

307
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:18,749
If you reached out your hand
to touch me,

308
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,338
it would find only air.

309
00:24:24,108 --> 00:24:25,589
I'm sorry that I betrayed you.

310
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:29,854
Forgive me.

311
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:32,856
Old Tom.

312
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:35,041
I can't do that.

313
00:24:37,252 --> 00:24:39,186
The living are so selfish.

314
00:24:39,914 --> 00:24:43,186
They can think of nothing
but themselves.

315
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,067
<i>Qui mihi</i>

316
00:25:00,547 --> 00:25:02,812
<i>discipulus puer es...</i>

317
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,755
Qui mihi... dis...

318
00:25:12,832 --> 00:25:14,793
Now, listen closely.

319
00:25:16,043 --> 00:25:17,553
When you have a tutor,

320
00:25:18,154 --> 00:25:20,060
you have to learn
these things Edward.

321
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:24,147
<i>Cupis atque...</i>

322
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,606
<i>Doceri...</i>

323
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,859
<i>Cupis...</i>

324
00:25:28,782 --> 00:25:31,961
<i>Atque...
doc...</i>

325
00:25:34,123 --> 00:25:37,577
- You want to go and play?
- Yes, if it please you, sister.

326
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:46,837
One day you will be a great King.

327
00:25:47,367 --> 00:25:48,586
I know you will be.

328
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:50,615
And very strong.

329
00:25:51,636 --> 00:25:53,486
But also fair and merciful.

330
00:25:55,023 --> 00:25:57,398
I want you to be a just ruler,

331
00:25:58,009 --> 00:26:00,278
and then indeed
you shall be a great King.

332
00:26:01,315 --> 00:26:02,315
Now...

333
00:26:02,885 --> 00:26:04,127
go along and play.

334
00:26:04,294 --> 00:26:05,844
Thank you, Elizabeth.

335
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,250
And God bless you!

336
00:26:35,532 --> 00:26:37,082
Mr. Thomas Culpepper.

337
00:26:49,756 --> 00:26:51,835
- My Lady. Yes Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

338
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:10,102
Who is that?

339
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,173
His name is Francis Dereham.

340
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,591
But where did he come from?

341
00:27:16,211 --> 00:27:17,721
I knew him a long time ago.

342
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,388
We both lived
with the Dowager Duchess.

343
00:27:20,741 --> 00:27:22,900
She wrote to me
recommending his services.

344
00:27:26,106 --> 00:27:27,735
How well did you know him?

345
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:31,399
What are you trying to say?

346
00:27:32,642 --> 00:27:34,562
How well did you know him?

347
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,628
We were children!

348
00:27:38,527 --> 00:27:40,075
You were never a child.

349
00:27:40,524 --> 00:27:42,074
- Ever!
- You should know!

350
00:27:45,743 --> 00:27:46,748
Don't touch me!

351
00:27:47,653 --> 00:27:49,533
Don't ever touch me like that!

352
00:27:50,557 --> 00:27:52,120
Don't you know who I am?

353
00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:53,964
Or what I could do to you?

354
00:27:58,488 --> 00:28:01,140
You don't think
you're the only one, do you?

355
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,600
I have a store of other lovers
beside you!

356
00:28:09,377 --> 00:28:10,477
Now get out!

357
00:28:11,976 --> 00:28:12,983
Get out!

358
00:28:19,326 --> 00:28:20,399
Your Majesty.

359
00:28:52,807 --> 00:28:53,857
Your Grace!

360
00:28:54,504 --> 00:28:55,604
Your Majesty

361
00:28:57,089 --> 00:29:01,031
The devoted clergy
of your Majesty's Church of England,

362
00:29:01,603 --> 00:29:04,695
and the nobility
and loyal gentlemen of York,

363
00:29:04,862 --> 00:29:06,570
welcome you most heartily.

364
00:29:07,149 --> 00:29:10,470
In gratitude for your Majesty's
gracious pardon

365
00:29:10,637 --> 00:29:14,502
of our previous, and grievous, sins,

366
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:16,274
we hope your Majesty

367
00:29:16,441 --> 00:29:19,103
will accept these purses of gold.

368
00:29:27,483 --> 00:29:28,983
We thank your Grace.

369
00:29:30,462 --> 00:29:31,603
We thank York!

370
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,544
Is everything prepared
for the King visit?

371
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:40,406
Yes, Your Majesty.
King James is waiting.

372
00:29:40,573 --> 00:29:43,073
I have sent messages
of reassurance to him.

373
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,448
Why?

374
00:29:44,786 --> 00:29:46,159
What is he afraid of?

375
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:48,303
Does he think
we're going to kill him?

376
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:57,618
And it's the same one?

377
00:29:57,785 --> 00:30:00,516
The one who visited her at night?
To whom she was promised?

378
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:03,176
Yes, my Lady.
It's the same gentleman.

379
00:30:03,814 --> 00:30:05,435
Can I interest you in this?

380
00:30:06,148 --> 00:30:07,724
He has not changed much.

381
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:10,425
Was he always so familiar?

382
00:30:11,756 --> 00:30:13,056
That is his way.

383
00:30:15,006 --> 00:30:16,156
Lord help us.

384
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,049
More wine, my Lady?

385
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,568
- No. Thank you.
- Come on.

386
00:30:37,115 --> 00:30:38,815
Just a little? One more.

387
00:30:39,584 --> 00:30:41,673
I said no, Mr. Dereham.

388
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:46,278
Thank you.

389
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,420
Christ!

390
00:30:58,968 --> 00:31:00,147
I'm going to bed.

391
00:31:00,314 --> 00:31:02,114
- Your Majesty.
- Ladies?

392
00:31:05,727 --> 00:31:06,906
Come, Ladies.

393
00:31:08,589 --> 00:31:09,589
Ladies.

394
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:17,334
Mr. Dereham.

395
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,278
I don't know who you are,

396
00:31:19,676 --> 00:31:22,976
but you have no right
to be so familiar with the Queen!

397
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:25,949
Or blaspheme in her presence.

398
00:31:27,663 --> 00:31:28,663
Mr. Fell,

399
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:32,140
I know the Queen of England a
great deal better than you do.

400
00:31:32,928 --> 00:31:35,727
- I don't think so.
- What do you mean"I don't think so"?

401
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:39,553
Her name is Katherine Howard,
and I've known her a long time.

402
00:31:40,226 --> 00:31:41,882
We used to be very close.

403
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,712
Very close.

404
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:58,899
Good night, sweet Edward.

405
00:32:05,532 --> 00:32:06,582
Lady Bryan!

406
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,636
Lady Bryan! Come quickly!

407
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,570
He has a fever. Feel his head.

408
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:20,681
- Go fetch a physician. Run!
- Yes Madam.

409
00:32:20,848 --> 00:32:23,274
- Send a message to my Lord Hertford.
- Yes, my Lady.

410
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:27,367
Poor lamb!

411
00:32:32,762 --> 00:32:35,286
Your behavior is a complete outrage.

412
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,624
I want you to promise,
that you will not speak of the Queen

413
00:32:40,255 --> 00:32:42,335
in ways which offend
her proper dignity.

414
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:46,839
Her dignity!

415
00:32:50,123 --> 00:32:52,223
I shall speak of her how I like.

416
00:32:52,855 --> 00:32:55,146
But you must not be so familiar.

417
00:32:55,508 --> 00:32:56,833
So familiar?

418
00:32:57,497 --> 00:32:59,301
Believe me,
I am very familiar with her.

419
00:32:59,468 --> 00:33:00,728
For God sake's, man!

420
00:33:01,176 --> 00:33:04,732
Your bragging and your lies
only harm yourself.

421
00:33:05,106 --> 00:33:06,106
My lies?

422
00:33:07,742 --> 00:33:11,091
You think that I am lying?
Let me tell you something, Mr. Fell.

423
00:33:11,776 --> 00:33:13,755
I know Katherine Howard well enough,

424
00:33:14,124 --> 00:33:15,827
for I have had her by the cunt.

425
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,177
My God, man!

426
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:20,350
And I would know it
among a hundred others.

427
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,699
I want you to give him a message.

428
00:33:35,864 --> 00:33:37,209
Who, your Majesty?

429
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,725
You know who!

430
00:33:41,275 --> 00:33:42,103
Tell him...

431
00:33:43,293 --> 00:33:45,343
- I must see him.
- My Lady...

432
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,691
Tell him there is a way
into my chamber.

433
00:33:48,216 --> 00:33:50,820
Tell him to come tomorrow,
when the King is asleep.

434
00:33:59,652 --> 00:34:00,691
What is it?

435
00:34:00,858 --> 00:34:03,499
Some kind of tertiary fever,
my Lord Hertford.

436
00:34:04,496 --> 00:34:05,501
Is he in danger?

437
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:10,173
Is his life in danger? Answer me!

438
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,800
If the fever persists, then perhaps.

439
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:17,055
We do have some remedies, my Lord.

440
00:34:20,724 --> 00:34:22,374
Shall we tell the King?

441
00:34:30,038 --> 00:34:33,213
If he felt obliged to curtail
his progress and hurry back,

442
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,678
only to find the Prince
quite recovered...

443
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:39,584
Apply your remedies.

444
00:34:39,887 --> 00:34:40,828
For God's sake

445
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:43,449
and for the sake of peace
in this realm

446
00:34:44,003 --> 00:34:45,499
don't let him die.

447
00:34:54,446 --> 00:34:56,046
It's very interesting.

448
00:34:56,555 --> 00:34:58,405
It's his cousin, is it not?

449
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,102
Your Majesty.

450
00:35:05,738 --> 00:35:07,208
Good afternoon, ladies.

451
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:09,357
Your Majesty.

452
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,150
I am sorry, I have left you alone.

453
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:14,220
I have had much to do
with Council and other matters.

454
00:35:14,387 --> 00:35:18,005
My nephew, James, King of Scots,
is due to visit here presently.

455
00:35:18,228 --> 00:35:19,848
We are to sign a peace treaty.

456
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,108
And then we shall straight
back to London. I promise.

457
00:35:24,893 --> 00:35:26,761
I am at your Majesty's command.

458
00:35:28,141 --> 00:35:29,376
Always.

459
00:35:31,524 --> 00:35:32,530
Now tell me,

460
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,171
is there any sign
that you may be with child?

461
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,140
Gentlemen.

462
00:36:00,014 --> 00:36:02,385
I hear the King of Scotland
is coming!

463
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:05,204
York will be full of drunken Scots

464
00:36:05,615 --> 00:36:08,332
with their brawny arms and togas.

465
00:36:08,582 --> 00:36:10,877
What a boon for you ladies!

466
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:17,842
Sit down, Mr. Dereham.

467
00:36:18,284 --> 00:36:20,946
- Did you send the message?
- Yes.

468
00:36:23,287 --> 00:36:24,348
Will he come?

469
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,974
We knew a Scot, didn't we?

470
00:36:29,617 --> 00:36:31,030
What was his name?

471
00:36:31,197 --> 00:36:32,325
Do you remember?

472
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:33,748
What was it?

473
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:35,910
Manox.

474
00:36:39,095 --> 00:36:40,545
You remember Manox?

475
00:36:43,325 --> 00:36:44,131
Sir?

476
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,386
Mr. Dereham!

477
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:51,217
Joan, you must remember Manox?

478
00:36:52,758 --> 00:36:54,679
I think you and he...

479
00:36:57,213 --> 00:36:59,014
That's quite enough, Mr. Dereham.

480
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:01,927
Ladies.

481
00:37:02,672 --> 00:37:03,705
Your Majesty.

482
00:37:05,394 --> 00:37:06,394
Gentlemen.

483
00:37:18,845 --> 00:37:19,946
How dare you!

484
00:37:20,266 --> 00:37:21,593
I shall tell the King.

485
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,803
He ought to know how beggardly
his wife's servants treat her.

486
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,764
Damn you, Fell!
Damn you!

487
00:37:27,931 --> 00:37:30,034
Mr. Dereham! Stop it!
Stop it now!

488
00:37:33,116 --> 00:37:34,434
What's that, my Lord?

489
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:38,005
Oh, nothing. A trifle.

490
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,975
I dare say
the Earl of Surrey's "Trifles"

491
00:37:41,142 --> 00:37:43,469
will someday be regarded
as some of our greatest poesy.

492
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:48,871
Then I dare say
your Grace can read it.

493
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,952
It's a translation, in sonnet form,

494
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,288
of one of Martial's epigrams.

495
00:37:57,247 --> 00:38:00,118
That is, of course, the Roman poet
but that doesn't matter.

496
00:38:00,285 --> 00:38:01,310
It's about...

497
00:38:02,767 --> 00:38:04,131
the happy life.

498
00:38:05,475 --> 00:38:07,184
The Golden Mean.

499
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,453
"The happy life be these, I find

500
00:38:15,332 --> 00:38:17,545
"The riches left, not got with pain

501
00:38:18,065 --> 00:38:19,368
"The fruitful ground;

502
00:38:20,303 --> 00:38:21,382
"the quiet mind

503
00:38:22,224 --> 00:38:23,421
"The equal friend;

504
00:38:24,043 --> 00:38:25,534
"no grudge nor strife

505
00:38:26,243 --> 00:38:28,393
"No charge of rule nor governance

506
00:38:29,688 --> 00:38:31,392
"Without disease, the healthful life

507
00:38:31,874 --> 00:38:33,737
"Wisdom joined with simplicity

508
00:38:36,046 --> 00:38:38,085
"The night discharged of all care."

509
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:39,824
The quiet mind.

510
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,172
The night discharged of all care.

511
00:38:45,544 --> 00:38:47,359
Wisdom joined with simplicity.

512
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,829
My God, how I wish
these things were true.

513
00:38:53,074 --> 00:38:55,516
Which of these, your Grace,
do you not have?

514
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:57,216
All of them.

515
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:00,252
Then you are like me.

516
00:39:00,788 --> 00:39:02,488
And like all the Romans.

517
00:39:03,057 --> 00:39:04,550
And all the Barbarians.

518
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:06,966
And all the generations before us...

519
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,535
And all those yet to come.

520
00:39:11,966 --> 00:39:15,044
For who does not wish,
or rest, with all their heart

521
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,523
for the quiet mind?

522
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:23,676
Tell me a single soul
who has ever found it?

523
00:39:44,386 --> 00:39:45,829
You've changed your mind, then?

524
00:39:47,061 --> 00:39:48,492
No, no.

525
00:39:49,477 --> 00:39:50,527
I love you.

526
00:39:51,395 --> 00:39:52,445
I told you.

527
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,893
I long for nothing so much
as to see you.

528
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:00,180
It makes my heart die
when I can't see you.

529
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:09,489
I love you, too.

530
00:40:10,002 --> 00:40:11,302
But this Dereham

531
00:40:12,415 --> 00:40:13,786
you have to get rid of him.

532
00:40:14,408 --> 00:40:16,465
Yes, I know. And I will.

533
00:40:16,752 --> 00:40:17,752
I promise.

534
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:19,785
When we get back to London.

535
00:40:24,711 --> 00:40:26,512
You're not still angry with me?

536
00:40:30,067 --> 00:40:31,815
Please don't be angry with me.

537
00:40:34,547 --> 00:40:36,547
I want to be at your commandment.

538
00:40:58,735 --> 00:41:00,218
You know what I want.

539
00:41:01,366 --> 00:41:02,366
Do it!

540
00:41:25,943 --> 00:41:26,943
That's it.

541
00:41:37,354 --> 00:41:39,304
Ah, yes. That's it, my sweet.

542
00:41:42,362 --> 00:41:44,000
My own sweet little fool.

543
00:42:19,293 --> 00:42:21,466
Your Majesty's gift
to the King of Scotland.

544
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,334
Well! What do you
have to say? Speak!

545
00:43:26,624 --> 00:43:27,438
Majesty,

546
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,106
the King is not coming.

547
00:43:29,543 --> 00:43:31,462
He has gone back to Edinburgh.

548
00:43:31,629 --> 00:43:34,250
But worse! O that God
could forgive them!

549
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,304
A Scottish army has ridden
over the border and is harrying

550
00:43:37,471 --> 00:43:40,034
our people, spoiling fields,
burning barns,

551
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,119
and killing all those
who oppose them.

552
00:43:50,189 --> 00:43:51,045
Sir Thomas!

553
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,639
Majesty.

554
00:43:54,806 --> 00:43:56,467
Order our troops to retaliate,

555
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,636
with spoils, burnings and killings.

556
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,555
Three hurts to every one of ours.
Do you understand?

557
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,486
Yes, your Majesty.
I am straight away to that business.

558
00:44:41,818 --> 00:44:42,638
Majesty.

559
00:44:45,128 --> 00:44:49,029
What do you want? Speak
or I will cut out your tongue!

560
00:44:49,461 --> 00:44:51,620
I am to tell you that your son,

561
00:44:51,951 --> 00:44:55,025
Prince Edward,
is dangerously ill at Windsor.

562
00:45:21,831 --> 00:45:22,981
Your Majesty.

563
00:46:06,144 --> 00:46:09,094
Blessed Father, have mercy
on my brother Edward.

564
00:46:11,366 --> 00:46:13,803
<i>Qui sedes ad dexteram Patris Filim.</i>

565
00:47:20,018 --> 00:47:21,018
Father.

566
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:45,366
My Lord,
send for the Bishop of London.

567
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:48,466
Tell him to prepare a special Mass
in the Chapel Royal,

568
00:47:49,121 --> 00:47:52,539
to give thanks to God
for my son and for my wife.

569
00:47:53,284 --> 00:47:54,684
Yes, your Majesty.

570
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,987
In the name of the Father, Son,

571
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:30,420
and Holy Ghost.

572
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,753
On this Day of All Saints,

573
00:48:34,617 --> 00:48:38,326
his Majesty wishes to thank God
for blessing him

574
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,707
with so perfect a companion...

575
00:48:41,414 --> 00:48:42,646
as Queen Katherine.

576
00:48:44,139 --> 00:48:45,714
In his Majesty's own words:

577
00:48:46,512 --> 00:48:48,550
"I render thanks to Thee, O Lord,"

578
00:48:48,982 --> 00:48:51,211
"that after so many
strange accidents

579
00:48:51,378 --> 00:48:53,336
"that have befallen my marriages,

580
00:48:53,895 --> 00:48:56,624
"though has been pleased
to give me a wife

581
00:48:56,959 --> 00:49:00,479
"so entirely conformed
to my inclinations as her

582
00:49:00,742 --> 00:49:01,892
"I now have."

583
00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:05,613
<i>Gaudeamus omnes in Domino,</i>

584
00:49:07,052 --> 00:49:09,692
<i>diem festum celebrantes</i>

585
00:49:09,859 --> 00:49:11,834
<i>sub honore sanctorum omnium...</i>
