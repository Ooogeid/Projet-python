a final decision

on his annulment for the sake
of peace in England.

as far as the Law of Christ
allows.

8

and excommunicate the King.

we're to be married

have three people in a marriage!

would happen if he married Anne

betraying his lawful wife.

00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:48,655
as an attack
against abuses.

174
00:13:48,755 --> 00:13:51,224
But rather, an open attack

175
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,727
upon our faith...

176
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:57,697
[Coughing]
...and the faith
of our ancestors.

177
00:13:57,764 --> 00:14:00,467
- If that is your judgement,
Your Grace, it is not mine.

178
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:03,370
Neither is it
the King's.

179
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:17,450
- Nan!

180
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,519
- Yes, Madam?
- Draw me a bath.

181
00:14:19,619 --> 00:14:21,688
The walk has made me cold.
- Yes, Madam.

182
00:14:21,755 --> 00:14:24,524
- I've got such exciting news.

183
00:14:24,624 --> 00:14:26,860
We're going to Paris.

184
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:30,030
I'm going to be presented
before the King.

185
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:42,409
[Ominous music]

186
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,416
Nan!

187
00:14:53,987 --> 00:14:55,455
Who has been in
the apartment today?

188
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:57,791
- Nobody, Madam.
Not to my knowledge.

189
00:14:57,857 --> 00:14:59,893
Why?

190
00:14:59,993 --> 00:15:02,929
- Here is a book of prophecy.

191
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,369
This is the King,

192
00:15:09,436 --> 00:15:12,105
this is the Queen...

193
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:14,374
and this is myself,

194
00:15:14,474 --> 00:15:16,643
with my head cut off.

195
00:15:34,861 --> 00:15:36,730
[Footsteps approaching]

196
00:15:39,165 --> 00:15:42,302
- His Grace the
Duke of Suffolk.

197
00:15:44,537 --> 00:15:48,508
- Your Grace. I have
His Majesty's order

198
00:15:48,575 --> 00:15:50,343
to banish you from court.

199
00:15:51,911 --> 00:15:55,448
You have displeased him,
it seems.

200
00:15:58,218 --> 00:16:00,453
- Who are you, Mr. Cromwell?

201
00:16:02,188 --> 00:16:05,325
I feel like I should know,
but somehow I don't.

202
00:16:05,392 --> 00:16:08,194
- I am exactly as
Your Grace finds me.

203
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:12,399
I serve His Majesty
to the best of my ability.

204
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:16,036
- Someone told me that you were
once a mercenary soldier.

205
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:18,038
- I saw some action in my youth.

206
00:16:18,104 --> 00:16:21,408
As did Your Grace, I believe.

207
00:16:21,474 --> 00:16:25,412
- But I was never
a soldier of fortune.

208
00:16:25,512 --> 00:16:27,580
If I displeased the King,
it was in a good cause.

209
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,816
- I'm sure.

210
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,552
Although some
would argue otherwise.
- Like you?

211
00:16:32,652 --> 00:16:34,788
- I would never have
the temerity to argue

212
00:16:34,854 --> 00:16:37,424
with Your Grace.
- Not to my face anyway.

213
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:42,796
- Here is the order. You are
to leave court at once.

214
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,815
[All talking excitedly]
- I have here, in my hands,

215
00:17:01,881 --> 00:17:05,185
the oath which all members of
the clergy swear to the Pope

216
00:17:05,251 --> 00:17:08,488
at the time of their
consecration!

217
00:17:08,555 --> 00:17:10,990
It is in clean contrast

218
00:17:11,057 --> 00:17:14,427
to the oath they swear to us.

219
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:25,805
My beloved subjects...

220
00:17:25,872 --> 00:17:27,474
We thought the clergy

221
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,543
were wholly our subjects.

222
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,848
But now we can see they are
only half our subjects...

223
00:17:34,948 --> 00:17:38,184
if they are our subjects at all!

224
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,395
My Lords,

225
00:17:48,495 --> 00:17:51,364
I demand to know,

226
00:17:51,431 --> 00:17:55,035
whose subjects are you:

227
00:17:55,135 --> 00:17:58,204
the Pope's

228
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,373
or mine?

229
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,377
[Murmuring]

230
00:18:18,591 --> 00:18:21,027
- Sir George Throckmorton,
Your Honour.
- Sir George!

231
00:18:21,127 --> 00:18:23,163
Very glad to see you.

232
00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:26,399
I know you are
a good Catholic man

233
00:18:26,466 --> 00:18:29,502
who has never been afraid
to speak his conscience.

234
00:18:29,602 --> 00:18:32,372
- So, in truth, should
every man, Your Honour.

235
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:36,242
- Indeed. But these days,
it seems there are many

236
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:39,646
who can be bullied
into silence, or worse,

237
00:18:39,713 --> 00:18:42,482
into acting against
their conscience.

238
00:18:42,582 --> 00:18:46,353
Mark my words, George:
these next few days

239
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:49,689
will determine the future
of our faith.

240
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:52,125
Whatever Mr. Cromwell says,

241
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:55,061
however he dresses his
argument up with honeyed words,

242
00:18:55,161 --> 00:18:58,531
the effect remains the same:
he is demanding

243
00:18:58,598 --> 00:19:02,836
that the clergy submit
themselves totally to the King's
will and to secular authority.

244
00:19:02,902 --> 00:19:04,938
God forbid he should
ever succeed!

245
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:07,741
If he does, there will be no
more Church, no more religion,

246
00:19:07,841 --> 00:19:11,511
no more spiritual life
in this kingdom!

247
00:19:11,611 --> 00:19:14,447
Cromwell might as well rape
the Blessed Virgin himself!

248
00:19:14,514 --> 00:19:16,483
- Your Honour!

249
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:19,319
- That's why I'm asking you,
asking you and people like you,

250
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:21,321
to remain strong and true.

251
00:19:21,388 --> 00:19:24,391
If you do,

252
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:27,994
then you will deserve
God's great reward,

253
00:19:28,094 --> 00:19:32,432
and much worship will
come to you personally.

254
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:35,268
Believe me,

255
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:37,604
in time even the King himself
will thank you.

256
00:19:37,704 --> 00:19:40,006
- We give thanks

257
00:19:40,106 --> 00:19:42,575
for the reign
of the King's Grace,

258
00:19:42,676 --> 00:19:44,878
and we ask God's blessing on him

259
00:19:44,944 --> 00:19:47,480
and on his people...

260
00:19:47,547 --> 00:19:51,418
But on this holy day,
we are obliged to say

261
00:19:51,484 --> 00:19:55,689
that some of your Highness's
preachers are these days

262
00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:58,391
too much like those
of Ahab's days,

263
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,493
in whose mouths was found

264
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:03,463
a false and lying spirit.

265
00:20:03,563 --> 00:20:08,301
[People whispering]
Theirs is the gospel of untruth,

266
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:12,339
not afraid to tell of licence
and liberty for monarchs,

267
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:14,541
which no Christian king
should dare

268
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:18,545
even to contemplate!
[People clamouring]

269
00:20:18,611 --> 00:20:20,947
I beseech Your Highness
to take heed,

270
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:23,917
not to pursue the path
you seem to be taking,

271
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:26,953
or you will surely
follow Ahab,

272
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:29,589
who married
the whore Jezebel,

273
00:20:29,656 --> 00:20:32,459
and surely will incur
his unhappy end, that dogs

274
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,828
will lick your blood
as they licked Ahab's...

275
00:20:35,395 --> 00:20:37,831
which God avert and forbid!

276
00:20:37,897 --> 00:20:41,201
[Shouting and clamouring]
Unhand me, you dogs!

277
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:43,570
I am a man of God!

278
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,338
Unhand me!

279
00:20:45,438 --> 00:20:46,940
Unhand me!

280
00:20:47,007 --> 00:20:50,343
[Clamouring]

281
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,350
I am a man of God! Unhand me!

282
00:20:58,918 --> 00:21:01,488
- You shameless friar!
You'll be sewn in a sack

283
00:21:01,588 --> 00:21:04,858
and thrown into the Thames
if you don't speedily
hold your tongue.

284
00:21:04,924 --> 00:21:07,627
- Keep your threats for
your fellow courtiers.

285
00:21:07,727 --> 00:21:09,896
As for us friars, we take
no account of them at all,

286
00:21:09,963 --> 00:21:13,667
since we know very well
that the way to heaven is
as good by water as by land.

287
00:21:20,407 --> 00:21:23,309
[Cawing]
[Gavel pounding]

288
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,346
- All rise for the King!

289
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:29,849
[People whispering]

290
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:50,370
- Parliament
is in session!

291
00:21:57,077 --> 00:22:00,347
- My Lords...

292
00:22:00,447 --> 00:22:03,650
Your Graces...

293
00:22:03,717 --> 00:22:06,219
Have you come
to a decision?

294
00:22:06,286 --> 00:22:09,456
Do you still deny me,

295
00:22:09,522 --> 00:22:11,391
or do you accept

296
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:15,428
the authority of your King?

297
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:22,435
- Your Grace.

298
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,352
- Your Majesty.
[Coughing]

299
00:22:43,523 --> 00:22:45,558
[Coughing]

300
00:22:45,658 --> 00:22:48,962
Here is...

301
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:50,897
the submission of the clergy...

302
00:22:50,997 --> 00:22:54,434
to Your Majesty's will.

303
00:22:54,501 --> 00:22:57,537
[People whispering]

304
00:22:57,604 --> 00:22:59,506
- There.

305
00:22:59,606 --> 00:23:01,941
- Thank you, Archbishop.
- They've surrendered.

306
00:23:02,008 --> 00:23:05,578
The Church is broken.

307
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:08,915
- I never thought
I would live

308
00:23:08,982 --> 00:23:12,385
to see this day
in England.

309
00:23:12,452 --> 00:23:15,021
- Now, by act of Parliament,
heretics are free

310
00:23:15,121 --> 00:23:19,025
to swan around the streets
of London without check.

311
00:23:19,092 --> 00:23:21,127
- If I could weep,
Sir Thomas,

312
00:23:21,194 --> 00:23:23,863
I would weep
tears of blood.

313
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:33,239
[Sighing]
[Door opening]

314
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,542
- Sir Thomas More.

315
00:23:43,483 --> 00:23:45,719
- Sir Thomas.

316
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:49,656
- Your Majesty.

317
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:57,931
I come to offer my resignation
from my post as Chancellor.

318
00:23:57,997 --> 00:24:00,433
I ask Your Highness
to allow me

319
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,170
to withdraw
from public life,

320
00:24:04,237 --> 00:24:06,606
so that I may spend
what time remains to me

321
00:24:06,706 --> 00:24:09,409
provisioning my soul,

322
00:24:09,476 --> 00:24:11,378
and in the service of God.

323
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,817
In this bag I carry
the Great Seal of my office,

324
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:21,955
which I find now
too heavy to hold.

325
00:24:43,476 --> 00:24:47,180
- I discharge you...

326
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,882
most willingly.

327
00:24:50,984 --> 00:24:53,553
In everything you have done
for me, Sir Thomas,

328
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,422
you have always...

329
00:24:55,488 --> 00:24:59,392
been good and gracious,

330
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:01,928
both in private

331
00:25:02,028 --> 00:25:04,297
and in public affairs.

332
00:25:05,832 --> 00:25:07,967
- Majesty.

333
00:25:09,602 --> 00:25:12,439
I promise on my honour

334
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:14,841
that I will never speak publicly

335
00:25:14,908 --> 00:25:17,344
of Your Majesty's Great Matter.

336
00:25:18,845 --> 00:25:22,916
But now, in private,

337
00:25:22,982 --> 00:25:25,051
I must confess to you,
as someone

338
00:25:25,151 --> 00:25:27,721
who once enjoyed Your Majesty's
confidence and friendship,

339
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:30,857
my deepest belief that,
if Your Majesty saw fit

340
00:25:30,924 --> 00:25:33,393
to be reconciled
with Queen Katherine,

341
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,429
the divisions and hurts
of your Kingdom

342
00:25:36,496 --> 00:25:39,299
would at once be healed.

343
00:25:46,606 --> 00:25:48,408
There. I've said it.

344
00:25:51,444 --> 00:25:53,847
And now my lips
are forever sealed.

345
00:25:55,582 --> 00:25:57,384
- Thomas!

346
00:26:00,153 --> 00:26:03,423
I will hold you to that promise.

347
00:26:31,718 --> 00:26:34,054
- Lady Elizabeth. I come
on the King's business.

348
00:26:34,154 --> 00:26:36,523
- Mr. Wyatt.

349
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:38,758
- Where is
the Lady Katherine?

350
00:26:38,825 --> 00:26:41,795
- Her Majesty is at prayer
and will be for a long time.

351
00:26:41,861 --> 00:26:43,897
She cannot be disturbed.

352
00:26:43,997 --> 00:26:46,666
- I am charged to deliver this.
- What is it?

353
00:26:46,733 --> 00:26:49,903
- A command that Lady Katherine
return her official jewels.

354
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,349
Lady Elizabeth...

355
00:27:05,285 --> 00:27:08,388
- What do you want?
- You know what I want.

356
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:14,427
- Mr. Wyatt, I have no intention
of becoming your mistress.

357
00:27:14,494 --> 00:27:18,064
Nor anyone else's,
for that matter.

358
00:27:18,131 --> 00:27:21,701
I shall be a virgin
when I marry, but I doubt

359
00:27:21,768 --> 00:27:25,105
I shall marry at all. I would
rather be a bride of Christ.

360
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:28,475
- A nun? I don't think so.

361
00:27:30,777 --> 00:27:33,646
Check your pocket.

362
00:27:59,272 --> 00:28:02,776
"Would God thou knewest
the depth of my desire...

363
00:28:02,842 --> 00:28:05,912
"Then might I hope, thou
nought I can deserve...

364
00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:09,149
Some drops of grace would
quench
my scorching fire."

365
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:11,584
[Door opening]

366
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,656
[Festive music, laughter]

367
00:28:22,262 --> 00:28:24,764
- I trust all
the arrangements

368
00:28:24,831 --> 00:28:28,134
have been made
for my visit to France?
- Yes, everything is prepared

369
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:31,237
and ready, Your Majesty.
King Francis

370
00:28:31,338 --> 00:28:33,540
is most eager to see
Your Majesty again,

371
00:28:33,606 --> 00:28:36,609
and to sign with you a new
alliance of friendship.

372
00:28:36,676 --> 00:28:38,478
- And the Lady Anne?

373
00:28:38,578 --> 00:28:41,381
- She will be received
with all due honour.

374
00:28:41,448 --> 00:28:43,950
- I'm very glad to hear it.

375
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,353
I only want
the best for her.

376
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:49,789
I want this visit to be special.

377
00:28:49,856 --> 00:28:51,391
And I don't want
anything to spoil it.

378
00:28:51,491 --> 00:28:54,427
Do you understand me?

379
00:28:54,494 --> 00:28:57,364
- I understand. Completely.

380
00:28:57,464 --> 00:28:59,499
And so does His Majesty.

381
00:29:10,443 --> 00:29:12,245
[Applause]

382
00:29:15,148 --> 00:29:18,318
- Thank you, Mr. Smeaton.

383
00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:24,557
- Sweetheart.

384
00:29:24,657 --> 00:29:28,528
- Your Majesty, this is
the young gentleman
I told you about:

385
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:30,697
Mark Smeaton.
- Mr. Smeaton.

386
00:29:30,764 --> 00:29:33,733
The Lady Anne has told me
a lot about you.

387
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,937
She says you play very well.

388
00:29:38,004 --> 00:29:39,406
Play something for us.

389
00:29:39,472 --> 00:29:43,376
- Your Majesty.
[Snaps his fingers]

390
00:29:51,451 --> 00:29:55,355
[Lively air]

391
00:30:14,574 --> 00:30:17,644
- I know it was wrong
for the Duke of Suffolk
to say what he did,

392
00:30:17,744 --> 00:30:21,348
but do you think it's possible
we could forgive him?

393
00:30:21,414 --> 00:30:24,117
- If you forgave him
so quickly,

394
00:30:24,184 --> 00:30:26,386
some people might think
that there was some truth

395
00:30:26,486 --> 00:30:29,489
to what he said.
- Yes, but to refute them,

396
00:30:29,556 --> 00:30:33,259
to answer the matter directly
and to show how much
I trust you,

397
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,729
I will do a more
important thing.

398
00:30:38,164 --> 00:30:40,433
I will invite Mr. Wyatt
to come to France with us.

399
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,703
That way, no one can
accuse me of jealousy,

400
00:30:43,803 --> 00:30:45,672
or the slightest
suspicion.

401
00:30:48,608 --> 00:30:51,644
- My love, you have
no reason to be suspicious.

402
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,049
Nor will ever have.

403
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:09,496
- I've received a most
illuminating letter from
our friend Cranmer.

404
00:31:09,562 --> 00:31:11,598
It appears that, in Nürnberg,

405
00:31:11,664 --> 00:31:14,434
clergy are allowed to marry.

406
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:17,437
And Mr. Cranmer has taken
full advantage of that fact.

407
00:31:17,537 --> 00:31:20,607
- You mean he got married?
- So it seems.

408
00:31:20,674 --> 00:31:24,310
- Well, it won't do
his career much good here.

409
00:31:24,444 --> 00:31:26,546
Being illegal.

410
00:31:26,613 --> 00:31:31,384
[Chuckling]
- Well, it's illegal for
the clergy to marry now, yes.

411
00:31:33,653 --> 00:31:36,790
- What are you saying?

412
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,392
You want priests
to be able to marry?

413
00:31:42,095 --> 00:31:45,131
- Perhaps I have never fully
explained myself to you,
Your Lordship.

414
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:51,938
When, to you and to others,
I have attacked the practices

415
00:31:52,205 --> 00:31:54,040
of the Catholic Church--

416
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,911
pilgrimages and the
worshipping of saints,

417
00:31:57,977 --> 00:32:00,046
crawling to the cross,

418
00:32:00,246 --> 00:32:04,451
veneration of priests...

419
00:32:04,551 --> 00:32:08,121
I've never been interested
in reforming them.

420
00:32:08,221 --> 00:32:10,423
No.

421
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:14,828
My real,
my only interest

422
00:32:14,928 --> 00:32:16,463
is in destroying them.

423
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:23,036
- [Whispering]: On the contrary,
Mr. Secretary.

424
00:32:23,103 --> 00:32:26,473
I think we understand
each other perfectly.

425
00:32:34,748 --> 00:32:37,684
[Applause]

426
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:47,093
- There is
something else,

427
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,629
something very important,
which must be done

428
00:32:49,696 --> 00:32:52,332
before we can
sail for France.

429
00:32:52,432 --> 00:32:54,401
- What?

430
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:00,073
Tell me!
- Shh...

431
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,842
[Giggling]

432
00:33:02,909 --> 00:33:05,612
- Make way for the Lady Anne.
Make way.

433
00:33:37,644 --> 00:33:40,480
- To all and singular, as well
nobles and gentiles as others

434
00:33:40,547 --> 00:33:44,584
to whom these presents
shall come, it is the King's
pleasure, by this patent,

435
00:33:44,684 --> 00:33:48,388
to confer on the Lady
Anne Boleyn,

436
00:33:48,488 --> 00:33:51,491
in her own right,
and on her offspring,

437
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:55,395
the noble title
of Marquess of Pembroke.

438
00:33:55,495 --> 00:33:58,465
And also by this patent,
to grant her lands

439
00:33:58,565 --> 00:34:01,835
worth 100,000
pounds a year,

440
00:34:01,935 --> 00:34:04,371
for the maintaining
of her dignity.

441
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:09,602
- The patent of your nobility.

442
00:35:09,669 --> 00:35:12,372
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

443
00:35:32,892 --> 00:35:36,496
- His Majesty the King
and the Lady Anne Boleyn,

444
00:35:36,563 --> 00:35:40,333
Marquess of Pembroke.
[Formal greetings]

445
00:35:53,646 --> 00:35:58,284
- Corpus Domini nostri
Jesu Christi

446
00:35:58,351 --> 00:36:02,455
custodiat tu in vitam aeternam.

447
00:36:02,555 --> 00:36:05,425
Our dearly beloved archbishop
Warham.

448
00:36:08,228 --> 00:36:10,630
- He died peacefully...

449
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:14,501
if one can say such
a thing at such a time.

450
00:36:14,601 --> 00:36:18,538
- He is, perhaps, fortunate
to be gathered now into heaven,

451
00:36:18,638 --> 00:36:21,174
before the final ruin

452
00:36:21,274 --> 00:36:22,976
of the Church he loved
and served.

453
00:36:23,043 --> 00:36:26,746
- You are resigned then,
Sir Thomas, to our ruin?

454
00:36:26,813 --> 00:36:29,716
- I don't know what else
can be done.

455
00:36:29,816 --> 00:36:31,985
We fought, and we failed.

456
00:36:34,487 --> 00:36:38,291
All I want now is
to be left in peace.

457
00:36:38,358 --> 00:36:41,261
To write and pray.

458
00:36:41,327 --> 00:36:44,597
- Surely we have a duty still
to act in the interests
of Christendom,

459
00:36:44,664 --> 00:36:47,133
whatever the cost!

460
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,736
- I have no fear of the cost.

461
00:36:49,803 --> 00:36:52,505
But I have...

462
00:36:52,605 --> 00:36:55,175
abjured the public realm.

463
00:36:55,241 --> 00:36:57,344
It no longer interests me.

464
00:36:59,546 --> 00:37:02,382
As it no longer interests
His Grace.

465
00:37:07,787 --> 00:37:11,224
[Praying]

466
00:37:27,107 --> 00:37:28,575
- Mistress Darrell.

467
00:37:30,577 --> 00:37:33,780
- I came to give you
your poem back.

468
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,350
- You cannot
give a poem back.

469
00:37:38,585 --> 00:37:40,020
Or a kiss.

470
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,257
Or a thought.

471
00:37:44,324 --> 00:37:46,760
- I'm sorry that
you are unhappy.

472
00:37:48,828 --> 00:37:51,731
Burning, as you say.

473
00:37:51,798 --> 00:37:54,534
I'm sure I've done
nothing to cause it.

474
00:37:54,634 --> 00:37:56,670
- Nothing?

475
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,806
My Lady, you are
full of causes.

476
00:37:59,873 --> 00:38:02,876
Your hair...

477
00:38:02,942 --> 00:38:05,311
your eyes...

478
00:38:05,412 --> 00:38:08,348
your lips...

479
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:13,386
All are causes of my desire.

480
00:38:24,964 --> 00:38:27,400
- I must go to Mass.

481
00:38:27,467 --> 00:38:30,503
- I know you must. I know.

482
00:38:30,603 --> 00:38:32,372
Stay a moment.

483
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,721
- Oh, what are you doing?

484
00:39:21,788 --> 00:39:24,391
- Giving you a chance

485
00:39:24,491 --> 00:39:26,493
to be penitent...

486
00:39:26,593 --> 00:39:28,695
my beautiful, pious lady.

487
00:39:49,516 --> 00:39:51,451
- Margaret,

488
00:39:51,518 --> 00:39:55,422
darling daughter...

489
00:39:55,488 --> 00:39:57,524
It might come to pass

490
00:39:57,624 --> 00:40:00,493
that I could be held to account
for my beliefs.

491
00:40:00,593 --> 00:40:03,229
- But the King allows
for your conscience...

492
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:05,765
- Nonetheless, it's better
to be prepared.

493
00:40:05,832 --> 00:40:08,335
- I don't understand.

494
00:40:08,401 --> 00:40:10,103
- Sweetheart...

495
00:40:12,472 --> 00:40:16,309
We must discuss
the question of martyrdom.

496
00:40:16,376 --> 00:40:19,746
No, no. Shh, shh...

497
00:40:19,846 --> 00:40:21,481
Listen.

498
00:40:21,548 --> 00:40:24,384
Because if I thought
my wife and children

499
00:40:24,484 --> 00:40:27,587
would encourage me
to die in a good cause,

500
00:40:27,687 --> 00:40:30,990
it would so comfort me,

501
00:40:31,291 --> 00:40:33,393
that in great joy I would

502
00:40:33,493 --> 00:40:35,862
merrily run to death.

503
00:40:35,929 --> 00:40:38,031
Please.

504
00:40:38,098 --> 00:40:39,499
Please.

505
00:40:43,536 --> 00:40:46,473
[Sobbing]
- Oh, Father!

506
00:40:54,114 --> 00:40:58,218
- What do you think?

507
00:40:58,284 --> 00:41:01,621
They are all in the French
fashion.
[Chuckling]

508
00:41:01,721 --> 00:41:04,357
This is the damask you gave me.

509
00:41:10,497 --> 00:41:12,298
Do you like them?

510
00:41:12,365 --> 00:41:15,902
I so want you to be proud of me!
- Oh, I will be.

511
00:41:16,002 --> 00:41:18,605
And these will help.

512
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:40,326
These are the jewels
of the Queens of England.

513
00:41:40,393 --> 00:41:42,662
I shall have them
reset for you.

514
00:41:52,072 --> 00:41:53,907
- I don't know what to say.

515
00:41:53,973 --> 00:41:55,875
- Yes, you do.

516
00:42:05,985 --> 00:42:08,054
- I love you.

517
00:42:09,923 --> 00:42:12,792
I love you with
my every breath.

518
00:42:12,859 --> 00:42:14,561
With every fibre
of my being.

519
00:42:14,627 --> 00:42:16,730
I love you
and I am yours.

520
00:42:16,796 --> 00:42:19,432
- And I am yours.

521
00:42:26,139 --> 00:42:27,774
- Wait!

522
00:42:29,909 --> 00:42:34,414
You have been
so kind to me...

523
00:42:34,514 --> 00:42:38,251
let me be kind to you.

524
00:42:42,489 --> 00:42:44,924
My love...

525
00:42:49,596 --> 00:42:51,598
