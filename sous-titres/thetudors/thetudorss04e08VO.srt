<i>Previously on The Tudors</i>

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,337
We will now proceed with our plans
for an invasion of France.

3
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:07,924
While I'm in Boulogne,
Queen Katherine will act as regent.

4
00:00:08,767 --> 00:00:12,068
Indeed, I suspect Her Majesty
of being a secret Protestant

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,472
and I intend one day to prove it.

6
00:00:16,597 --> 00:00:19,875
Majesty, the French consider
their strong ramparts and double walls

7
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,439
- invulnerable to our artillery!
- We shall see.

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,441
We've enough cannon to conquer hell.

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,691
Fire!

10
00:00:27,636 --> 00:00:30,101
The Emperor's forces
are at present besieging

11
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:32,266
the fortresses of Luxembourg
and St. Didier.

12
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,963
We'll break our siege first
then advance on Paris.

13
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,328
Mr. Latimer, I have a mind

14
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,583
to appoint you chaplain
to my household.

15
00:00:40,064 --> 00:00:43,264
Are you absolutely sure?
You must know my reputation.

16
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:46,279
Queen Catherine has
appointed Hugh Latimer

17
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,670
- as her private Chaplain.
- And I thought someone said

18
00:00:49,837 --> 00:00:51,760
she was an intelligent woman.

19
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,564
- Why won't you release me?
- You'll fight against us.

20
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,604
- I'll kill you.
- You're my prisoner.

21
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,540
I'll even get a ransom for you.

22
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,697
I intend to dig three tunnels.
One here, at the town wall.

23
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,063
We could be under the castle
and detonate

24
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,952
a huge explosion in three weeks.

25
00:01:17,392 --> 00:01:18,661
Two weeks.

26
00:01:19,594 --> 00:01:21,456
What do you think of Senor Treviso?

27
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:24,832
- The builder of tunnels.
- Do you think he's mad?

28
00:01:25,498 --> 00:01:26,910
He's not the only one.

29
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,874
I regret to inform you of the deaths
of ten of your Majesty's soldiers.

30
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,842
They all died of the bloody flux.

31
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,340
There is an outbreak of the disease
throughout your army.

32
00:01:36,823 --> 00:01:39,056
God alone knows
how many it will take away.

33
00:01:47,523 --> 00:01:48,608

Fire!

Reload. Stand ready!

39
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:17,673
Good God!

40
00:04:18,206 --> 00:04:19,968
Did you not find anything to eat?

41
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,761
There's nothing to find.

42
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:24,607
The whole countryside for miles
and miles is stripped

43
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:27,306
of every sheep, cow, pig,
hare, of anything edible.

44
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,931
French peasants came up to us,

45
00:04:30,098 --> 00:04:33,523
for a piece of bread because children
are dying for want of food.

46
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,968
It's not their little
ones I worry about.

47
00:04:36,837 --> 00:04:38,128
It's my own soldiers.

48
00:04:39,534 --> 00:04:42,542
It's a pity the French'll not come out
and break lances with us,

49
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:43,866
as they used to do.

50
00:04:45,522 --> 00:04:48,422
Then I could truly fancy I was
Lancelot Du Lac.

51
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:51,583
Instead of sitting here
in our own shit

52
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,101
and starving to death!

53
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:58,357
Except for the bastards
who try and run away!

54
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,202
Forward!

55
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,940
Reload!

56
00:05:15,697 --> 00:05:16,697
Run! Run!

57
00:05:18,957 --> 00:05:19,957
Stop! Stop!

58
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:21,266
Wait!

59
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,573
Don't move.

60
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:29,607
<i>Dai! Tornianno a lavorare.</i>

61
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:33,393
We do not have time
to be afraid, my friends.

62
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,284
Go, back to work.

63
00:05:47,585 --> 00:05:49,011
Do you know where we are?

64
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:52,807
The castle's still
three hundred feet away.

65
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:54,903
Christ!

66
00:05:58,363 --> 00:06:00,488
How many men have died of the flux?

67
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,619
- So far?
- Two thousand.

68
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:06,658
And a further three thousand
are sick with it and not fit to fight.

69
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,568
The sick are using
up our limited resources.

70
00:06:10,182 --> 00:06:13,841
In my opinion, they should be
separated from the well

71
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:15,757
and transported back to England.

72
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,544
I would have to that several ships
from my blockade!

73
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:21,714
What's the cause of this bloody flux
that so unmans us?

74
00:06:22,238 --> 00:06:24,906
Your Majesty, there is much
disagreement as to causes.

75
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:27,178
Some say it is the result
of lack of supplies.

76
00:06:27,852 --> 00:06:29,359
Others, by contrast,

77
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:31,057
say it comes of greed,

78
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,309
they have gorged
themselves on unripe fruit

79
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,907
and shellfish when
they first arrived.

80
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:40,650
What is certain is that there
is no way known to man

81
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,566
to stop its spreading infection.

82
00:06:45,202 --> 00:06:47,718
If the siege should continue
for much longer,

83
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:50,376
A great portion
of Your Majesty's army will soon

84
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,405
be dug into the fields of Boulogne.

85
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,039
I will not hear anymore about it!

86
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,834
You are as much my enemy
as the French,

87
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,913
since you seek to demoralize,
to lie about our weaknesses,

88
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,047
and to spin tales of sickness.

89
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,426
These men are not sick
from the flux but from cowardice!

90
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,928
And I will not send cowards home!

91
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:12,223
They will either fight
or I will hang them by the wayside.

92
00:07:13,524 --> 00:07:15,560
You! Get them from their sickbeds

93
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:18,688
back into that trench,
or I will make you a head shorter.

94
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,590
Yes, your Majesty.

95
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:24,961
And in the future tell me the truth!

96
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,706
Perhaps the initials
of these names...

97
00:07:41,922 --> 00:07:43,838
Bishop Gardiner
asks for an audience.

98
00:07:46,854 --> 00:07:47,954
Send him in.

99
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:52,139
Come, ladies.

100
00:07:57,249 --> 00:07:59,577
- Your Grace.
- Your Majesty.

101
00:08:01,362 --> 00:08:04,150
I have come to hear if there
is any fresh news of the King

102
00:08:04,675 --> 00:08:05,975
and his affairs?

103
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:10,522
The King is very well
and in the best of spirits.

104
00:08:10,912 --> 00:08:12,533
He has never seemed happier.

105
00:08:13,588 --> 00:08:15,983
We all pray for the King's life

106
00:08:16,378 --> 00:08:17,616
and his success.

107
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:21,507
There is one matter

108
00:08:21,674 --> 00:08:24,003
I should discuss with your Majesty,

109
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,060
since you act as Regent
in his absence.

110
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:29,383
Go on.

111
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,071
Having discovered a nest of heretics

112
00:08:32,238 --> 00:08:35,007
among the King's musicians
and destroyed it,

113
00:08:35,378 --> 00:08:39,060
we discover that there are heretics
even in the King's privy chambers.

114
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,480
Of whom do you speak, My Lord?

115
00:08:42,851 --> 00:08:45,251
The King's barber
and the royal cook.

116
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:49,415
We have evidence to draw up...

117
00:08:49,981 --> 00:08:51,322
this draft indictment.

118
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:54,669
All that we require
is your signature.

119
00:08:56,801 --> 00:09:00,769
My Lord, I praise you
for your diligence in these matters.

120
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:03,701
But I do not think it proper
to arrest men

121
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:07,168
so close to the King's
person-without first asking him.

122
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,682
There is one other matter.

123
00:09:18,618 --> 00:09:21,853
We have heard rumors
of an outbreak of plague near Windsor.

124
00:09:22,286 --> 00:09:24,390
So I have decided to invite
the Prince Edward

125
00:09:24,557 --> 00:09:26,440
to come here to court
and stay with me.

126
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,920
As you wish.

127
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:48,177
You! Move yourself!

128
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:49,668
Sergeant, over here!

129
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:52,038
Right, men!

130
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,709
All you boys, let's have you now.

131
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:03,153
Move it, move it!

132
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,104
Raise the light, boys!

133
00:10:19,343 --> 00:10:22,882
In return for your cooperation,
I allow your father to escape.

134
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,666
My cooperation?

135
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,211
You must promise not to try
and escape yourself.

136
00:10:52,673 --> 00:10:54,023
My father agrees.

137
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:55,961
Thank you.

138
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,382
He must go now.

139
00:11:42,971 --> 00:11:44,666
Release him outside the camp.

140
00:11:57,939 --> 00:11:59,089
Together now!

141
00:12:03,905 --> 00:12:06,058
Come on, up on your feet!

142
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,149
- What about water?
- Fire!

143
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,941
How are things, Harry?

144
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,340
Good.

145
00:12:18,897 --> 00:12:19,897
Here...

146
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:21,991
Here's some food.

147
00:12:23,513 --> 00:12:26,495
- That's your food.
- You need it more than I do.

148
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,807
I just sit outside
and watch the seagulls.

149
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,875
Go on, take it!

150
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:35,212
Eat it.

151
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,878
And the horses!
The horse is magnificent.

152
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,489
I bid you most welcome,
My Lord Hertford.

153
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,075
Your visit here confirms
your confidence in the Queen's Regency!

154
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:06,912
Majesty, I have heard
nothing but praise

155
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:10,790
in all quarters for her dedication
and skill in matters of state.

156
00:13:11,843 --> 00:13:14,046
She has great clarity of mind,

157
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:18,233
and a woman's touch
which soothes and cures

158
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,133
where a man would usually
rush into anger and complaint.

159
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:27,181
- And the boy?
- Prince Edward is well and healthy.

160
00:13:28,722 --> 00:13:30,788
- A toast to his health!
- To the Prince.

161
00:13:36,948 --> 00:13:38,233
What is it?

162
00:13:40,229 --> 00:13:41,327
Your Majesty,

163
00:13:41,494 --> 00:13:44,740
I have received word that
the Emperor has seized

164
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,921
both the fortresses
he was besieging,

165
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:49,894
and has taken fifteen
hundred enemy prisoners.

166
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:52,039
What did I tell you?

167
00:13:52,403 --> 00:13:54,959
I never trusted your methods.
Everything has taken too long.

168
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:58,721
You don't know
how to handle the soldiers!

169
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,132
I swear to God
I could have told you.

170
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:04,427
Siege warfare makes
men idle and bored.

171
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,846
They get soft.
Isn't that right, Your Grace?

172
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,515
- The men get soft.
- It's true,

173
00:14:09,908 --> 00:14:13,731
The camp is swarming with prostitutes.
But considering the conditions...

174
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:17,149
I want to make sure of the troops'
good behaviour in case of an assault.

175
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:21,086
We shall explode one of the charges
under the castle walls prematurely

176
00:14:21,743 --> 00:14:22,955
without warning.

177
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,824
We can observe the temper
of the troops in a sudden crisis.

178
00:14:27,237 --> 00:14:29,493
Majesty, please.
Listen to me, I beg you!

179
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,371
We are only days away
from mining under the castle...

180
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,521
For the love of God, please.

181
00:14:35,273 --> 00:14:36,973
So many, many lives lost

182
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,623
and for what?

183
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,570
Majesty, give me two days.

184
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,652
This is your food. Isn't it?

185
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:09,742
What about the people in the town?
What are they eating?

186
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:12,264
Their cats.

187
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:14,212
If they have cats.

188
00:15:22,516 --> 00:15:24,440
Why did you let my father go?

189
00:15:26,057 --> 00:15:27,200
I questioned him.

190
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:29,939
He couldn't tell me anything
useful about the town's defenses.

191
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:31,317
And I can?

192
00:15:31,586 --> 00:15:33,595
Why are you keeping me here?

193
00:15:48,273 --> 00:15:49,990
Are those muskets prepared?

194
00:15:58,981 --> 00:15:59,981
Lady Mary.

195
00:16:03,252 --> 00:16:07,176
I wanted to show you my translation
of Erasmus's "Gospel of St. John."

196
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,009
It is only started.

197
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,034
But it is dedicated to you...

198
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,605
Since I know how much
our faith matters to you.

199
00:16:21,297 --> 00:16:22,736
Thank you, Lady Mary.

200
00:16:26,643 --> 00:16:28,143
I am deeply touched.

201
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:31,381
Come!

202
00:16:37,361 --> 00:16:39,121
This is so nice for me

203
00:16:39,685 --> 00:16:41,750
To be
with all three of you together.

204
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,770
Which I think is as it should be!

205
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:48,966
Edward! I'll catch you!

206
00:16:51,438 --> 00:16:54,109
Prince Edward!
A little decorum, please!

207
00:16:54,276 --> 00:16:56,724
- Edward!
- Come here, your Grace.

208
00:16:59,557 --> 00:17:02,637
Now, tell me,
you love the Lady Bryan, don't you?

209
00:17:05,043 --> 00:17:06,793
I think she loves you too

210
00:17:07,364 --> 00:17:09,883
But I think that it is time
you were breeched

211
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,223
from the Lady Bryan and her nurses.

212
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:16,118
You are old enough to be placed
with your tutors, don't you think?

213
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,169
I suppose so.

214
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:21,131
Don't worry.

215
00:17:21,632 --> 00:17:23,250
There'll be other boys too.

216
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:26,138
There'll be
the Duke of Suffolk's son Henry.

217
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,650
It won't be all learning languages
and scriptures.

218
00:17:29,978 --> 00:17:32,217
You'll also learn tennis
and fencing,

219
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:33,731
music and dance.

220
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,888
That will be fun, won't it?

221
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:41,018
Good night, Prince.
Lady Bryan, thank you.

222
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:44,990
- Good night, your Majesty.
- Good night.

223
00:17:50,183 --> 00:17:53,035
- Good night, your Majesty.
- Good night, Lady Mary.

224
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,036
Come here. Let me hug you.

225
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:07,633
I expect great things of you,

226
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:09,922
and I shall not be disappointed.

227
00:18:10,282 --> 00:18:11,449
I hope not.

228
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,592
Now off to bed, sweet girl.

229
00:18:20,271 --> 00:18:22,021
Mistress Ashley, a moment.

230
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:25,975
Anne.

231
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,117
I believe that I can trust you.

232
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,454
I think that your family
are reformers.

233
00:18:44,448 --> 00:18:45,249
Yes.

234
00:18:47,677 --> 00:18:50,658
Lady Elizabeth's mother,
Anne Boleyn, was also

235
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:52,382
a Lutheran and a reformer.

236
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:55,259
I suppose it is my duty,
therefore, to bring

237
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,298
the daughter
up in the mother's faith.

238
00:18:57,465 --> 00:18:59,930
Would you have
any objection to that?

239
00:19:00,762 --> 00:19:02,067
None, your Majesty.

240
00:19:02,234 --> 00:19:05,678
I should be proud to help her
thus honor the memory of her mother,

241
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:08,605
whose life-and whose faith...
Too many so easily disparage.

242
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:09,964
Good.

243
00:19:10,337 --> 00:19:12,766
Then I will appoint
as her tutor Roger Ascham.

244
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:14,378
He is also one of us.

245
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,397
Mistress Ashley,

246
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,236
this conversation never happened.

247
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:22,549
Good night.

248
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,173
Good night, Your Majesty.

1
00:20:25,268 --> 00:20:27,268
- What?
- I broke my promise.

2
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,027
I escaped.

3
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,463
But I came back.

4
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,195
You've got blood on your head.

5
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,370
Thank you,

6
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,880
all of you.

7
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,244
It has been an honor and a privilege

8
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,992
to have worked
alongside men such as you.

9
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:53,664
<i>Grazie.</i>

10
00:22:57,102 --> 00:22:58,402
God be with you.

11
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,373
<i>Grazie.</i> God bless you, sir.

12
00:23:06,631 --> 00:23:08,080
<i>Grazie mille.</i>

13
00:23:11,572 --> 00:23:12,572
Go.

14
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,144
Clear the way!

15
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,278
Move for the cannon!

16
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,450
Come on Girolamo, come on.

17
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:19,832
Go!

18
00:24:20,538 --> 00:24:21,538
Run!

19
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:23,561
Run!

20
00:24:28,613 --> 00:24:30,704
He lied to me!
He's a charlatan!

21
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,400
Girolamo's mad again!

22
00:24:49,314 --> 00:24:50,314
Go!

23
00:24:53,306 --> 00:24:54,306
Run!

24
00:25:00,261 --> 00:25:01,261
No!

25
00:25:01,885 --> 00:25:03,880
- Girolamo!
- Save yourself!

26
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,113
Get in here!

27
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,056
They're injured in the mine!

28
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:19,101
We found somebody!
Quickly, get him out!

29
00:25:42,937 --> 00:25:44,543
Go on! Go on, sir!

30
00:25:46,094 --> 00:25:47,546
England!

31
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,478
The wall is down!

32
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,319
Victory!

33
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,547
Is there anyone else?

34
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:20,371
Are there any others?

35
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,232
- Is there anyone else alive in there?
- No.

36
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,414
England!

37
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:52,210
<i>Section Commanders, form up!</i>

38
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,809
<i>Form up your men!</i>

39
00:26:53,976 --> 00:26:56,258
<i>Prepare to take the city!</i>

40
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,762
<i>Forward!</i>

41
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:03,888
Yes.

42
00:27:12,123 --> 00:27:13,924
Children! Lady Mary!

43
00:27:15,112 --> 00:27:17,528
There is great news from France!

44
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,184
The king has taken Boulogne.

45
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,419
He is safe and triumphant.

46
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,690
Your father is a hero!

47
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,690
He has captured Boulogne!

48
00:27:34,448 --> 00:27:37,482
I'm certain he'll be home very soon.

49
00:27:37,974 --> 00:27:39,650
How wonderful.

50
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:15,953
Most victorious Prince,

51
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:19,503
as Governor of Boulogne,

52
00:28:20,235 --> 00:28:23,829
I have no choice but to surrender
the keys of the town.

53
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040
Monsieur.

54
00:28:33,026 --> 00:28:36,703
I trust your Majesty will allow
the inhabitants of the town

55
00:28:37,394 --> 00:28:39,842
and its unarmed garrison to leave

56
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,913
unmolested and in safety.

57
00:28:42,738 --> 00:28:44,979
I do so swear, on my honor.

58
00:28:46,387 --> 00:28:49,320
Although you and your company,
despite God's will,

59
00:28:49,852 --> 00:28:51,642
and contrary to all justice,

60
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:56,044
withheld from me a town which,
being a noble part of my inheritance,

61
00:28:56,727 --> 00:28:57,977
belonged to me.

62
00:29:00,226 --> 00:29:03,247
Well, I congratulate your Majesty.

63
00:29:04,026 --> 00:29:06,995
You have captured one of the most
beautiful town in France.

64
00:29:19,988 --> 00:29:23,126
In their great necessity,
many of them ate horseflesh.

65
00:29:23,755 --> 00:29:26,925
Did you see them go out?
Even the priests were thin!

66
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,102
So, my Lord Hertford,

67
00:29:32,053 --> 00:29:33,753
was it well done or not?

68
00:29:34,175 --> 00:29:36,318
Was it not God's will
that we should reclaim

69
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:39,036
part of our just rights
and inheritance?

70
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:43,508
The capture of Boulogne will live
forever in the hearts of all Englishmen,

71
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,072
ad the eighth Henry
as well as the fifth,

72
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:48,712
in the glorious annals of our realm.

73
00:29:52,576 --> 00:29:55,296
I call Boulogne "our daughter."

74
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:00,424
And I am the "King's Highness
of Boulogne!"

75
00:30:03,921 --> 00:30:04,921
Hertford.

76
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,630
Majesty.

77
00:30:10,802 --> 00:30:12,886
A toast! To all.

78
00:30:13,053 --> 00:30:14,539
To all!

79
00:30:14,937 --> 00:30:16,003
And to victory.

80
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,574
And to victory!

81
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:23,274
Your Majesty.

82
00:30:27,714 --> 00:30:28,764
Your Grace.

83
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,292
Your Grace, I have much
to thank you for.

84
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:38,032
You have distinguished yourself
above all in this campaign.

85
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:39,921
I am grateful to your Majesty.

86
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:43,105
And now, I assume,
we are march on Paris?

87
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:46,777
Why would you assume that?

88
00:30:50,212 --> 00:30:52,009
Forgive me, I don't understand.

89
00:30:52,176 --> 00:30:54,978
I thought that was the purpose
of the pact with the Emperor.

90
00:30:56,458 --> 00:31:00,326
Do you suppose we should march
on Paris with half an army,

91
00:31:01,254 --> 00:31:04,455
with thousands of sick soldiers,
and in winter?

92
00:31:06,046 --> 00:31:07,198
No, your Grace,

93
00:31:07,643 --> 00:31:10,628
right now, Boulogne is now far
more important to me than Paris,

94
00:31:10,795 --> 00:31:12,119
than ten Parises!

95
00:31:12,817 --> 00:31:14,330
No, we shall back to England.

96
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,951
We have gained
here a singular victory.

97
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:21,689
And I mean to hold onto it.

98
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:25,049
I shall leave Surrey
in command of the town.

99
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:27,159
- Surrey?
- Yes.

100
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,597
Is that a problem, your Grace?

101
00:31:33,969 --> 00:31:35,319
No, your Majesty.

102
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,735
Your Grace.

103
00:32:48,873 --> 00:32:49,873
I'm sorry.

104
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:03,849
Am I free to go?

105
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,275
Yes.

106
00:33:08,581 --> 00:33:09,981
You're free to go.

107
00:33:11,082 --> 00:33:13,700
You didn't ask for a ransom?

108
00:33:14,518 --> 00:33:15,518
No.

109
00:33:16,921 --> 00:33:20,802
Then, do you think
I'm not worth anything?

110
00:33:23,154 --> 00:33:24,154
You...

111
00:33:25,431 --> 00:33:27,085
are worth everything.

112
00:33:33,139 --> 00:33:34,539
Come back with me.

113
00:33:35,668 --> 00:33:36,472
Where?

114
00:33:36,993 --> 00:33:38,043
To England.

115
00:33:39,902 --> 00:33:43,271
As your mistress, your French whore?

116
00:33:44,595 --> 00:33:45,595
No.

117
00:33:46,002 --> 00:33:47,002
Then what?

118
00:33:53,851 --> 00:33:54,851
<i>Je t'aime</i>

119
00:33:57,551 --> 00:33:59,970
<i>Je t'aime. C'est tout.</i>

120
00:34:54,485 --> 00:34:55,701
My Lady.

121
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,925
Your Majesty,

122
00:35:13,228 --> 00:35:14,950
it makes me so glad

123
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:18,842
to see you so well and happy.

124
00:35:19,673 --> 00:35:21,445
And returned safe, thank God.

125
00:35:22,652 --> 00:35:24,850
And victorious, thank God!

126
00:35:26,149 --> 00:35:27,399
And victorious.

127
00:35:58,816 --> 00:35:59,816
Bishop.

128
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:56,720
Gentlemen, for all this celebration,
I am very worried

129
00:36:56,887 --> 00:36:58,841
about our state of affairs.

130
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,582
The King's enterprise
has bankrupted our exchequer.

131
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,889
Is that not correct, Sir Richard?

132
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:08,886
We're at our wit's end to know how
to get revenues to pay for the campaign,

133
00:37:09,053 --> 00:37:11,312
or even shift for the next
two or three months.

134
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:15,010
We are at war with France
and with Scotland.

135
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:18,154
We have the enmity
of the bishop of Rome.

136
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:20,863
We no longer have assurances
of friendship with the Emperor.

137
00:37:21,435 --> 00:37:24,080
This war has proved
noisome to the realm

138
00:37:24,247 --> 00:37:26,118
and disastrous for our merchants.

139
00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:28,605
Gentlemen, God help us,

140
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:30,775
we live in a world where...

141
00:37:31,593 --> 00:37:33,751
reason and learning
no longer prevail

142
00:37:35,284 --> 00:37:37,214
and covenants are little regarded.

143
00:37:37,562 --> 00:37:41,509
And where it seems
even our Queen is a heretic.

144
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:43,770
It's true.

145
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:47,568
And it will be God's work
to destroy her.

146
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,419
Your Excellency.

147
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:02,884
Your Grace.

148
00:38:25,786 --> 00:38:27,036
Your Majesties,

149
00:38:27,982 --> 00:38:30,633
you should know that,
due to my infirmity,

150
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,311
I have applied for a recall to Spain

151
00:38:34,337 --> 00:38:37,212
and am even now am awaiting
the Emperor's permission.

152
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:39,901
Madam,

153
00:38:41,134 --> 00:38:43,446
I would like to take this opportunity
to thank you,

154
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,095
on behalf of his Majesty
the Emperor,

155
00:38:46,669 --> 00:38:49,160
for all that you have done
for the Lady Mary

156
00:38:49,764 --> 00:38:53,208
and for fostering the friendship
between England and Spain.

157
00:38:55,855 --> 00:38:58,123
Excellency, what I have done
for the Lady Mary

158
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,338
is much less than
I would like to do,

159
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,379
as well as being my duty
in every respect.

160
00:39:04,648 --> 00:39:07,286
And as for the friendship
between our two countries,

161
00:39:07,453 --> 00:39:09,931
I have done and will do nothing
to prevent it

162
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,928
from growing still further,
as the friendship is so necessary

163
00:39:14,598 --> 00:39:16,108
and both sovereigns...

164
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:17,939
so good.

165
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:20,474
As are you, my Lady.

166
00:39:25,876 --> 00:39:26,926
Excellency!

167
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:28,616
Majesty.

168
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:32,267
I hear your Master has signed
a separate treaty with the French.

169
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:34,124
Is it true?

170
00:39:35,766 --> 00:39:37,475
I asked you if it was true!

171
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,877
Is it so hard a question, Eustace?

172
00:39:43,325 --> 00:39:45,508
Yes, it's true, your Majesty.

173
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,686
And why should he do that?

174
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:49,853
We were supposed to be allies.

175
00:39:51,499 --> 00:39:54,016
I believe his Majesty had no choice.

176
00:39:54,698 --> 00:39:57,144
He had spent too long besieging
the town of Luxembourg;

177
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:59,070
His army was riddled with disease.

178
00:39:59,237 --> 00:40:01,260
He still should not have done it!

179
00:40:02,176 --> 00:40:03,426
Behind my back!

180
00:40:04,942 --> 00:40:07,788
I trusted him and he betrayed me.

181
00:40:08,036 --> 00:40:08,836
Your...

182
00:40:09,003 --> 00:40:11,200
You defended and excused
him your whole life!

183
00:40:13,294 --> 00:40:14,787
He is not to be trusted...

184
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:18,582
And you should be relieved that you
no longer have to lie on his behalf.

185
00:40:20,444 --> 00:40:22,586
You have my permission
to leave my court.

186
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,882
I wish you a long and happy
retirement, your Excellency.

187
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:31,417
Your Majesty.

188
00:40:51,047 --> 00:40:52,408
Farewell, your Excellency.

189
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:08,507
She is taller than me, isn't she?

190
00:41:09,861 --> 00:41:10,861
A little.

191
00:41:11,774 --> 00:41:14,371
How would you describe her?

192
00:41:16,531 --> 00:41:18,517
I would describe her as my wife.

193
00:41:22,085 --> 00:41:23,753
When shall I meet her?

194
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:25,543
Do you want to meet her?

195
00:41:27,238 --> 00:41:28,905
But your son Henry?

196
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:31,726
Yes, sometime.

197
00:41:37,757 --> 00:41:38,996
What are you thinking?

198
00:41:42,103 --> 00:41:43,403
That I was dead,

199
00:41:44,782 --> 00:41:46,212
and am alive again.

200
00:41:52,836 --> 00:41:54,220
Let me look at you.

201
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:20,090
Say something.

202
00:42:24,431 --> 00:42:26,081
Words aren't important.

203
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:54,600
You mustn't go.

204
00:42:55,181 --> 00:42:56,281
I forbid it.

205
00:42:57,463 --> 00:42:58,834
My Lady, I have to.

206
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,020
You can see how it is with me.

207
00:43:04,801 --> 00:43:06,201
And what about me?

208
00:43:07,248 --> 00:43:10,021
Madam, I don't think I could have
ever left you in better care

209
00:43:10,188 --> 00:43:11,738
than Queen Catherine.

210
00:43:12,317 --> 00:43:13,841
I believe she loves you.

211
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:19,425
She may love me.

212
00:43:20,626 --> 00:43:21,776
I don't know.

213
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,313
What I do know is
that she is not of our faith.

214
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:30,604
She pretends,
but she is not a Catholic.

215
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,195
She is a heretic and still
you leave me in her care!

216
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:35,565
Madam...

217
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:39,665
No, it is not your fault.

218
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,286
It is my fault.

219
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:47,010
If I had been a boy and not a girl,
none of this would have ever happened.

220
00:43:47,177 --> 00:43:49,142
And England would still be faithful.

221
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:51,373
Princess! I beg you.

222
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,559
I am a lot older than I was
when I first knew you.

223
00:43:57,308 --> 00:43:58,308
And wiser.

224
00:44:00,794 --> 00:44:03,199
I do not know
if I shall ever be married,

225
00:44:04,361 --> 00:44:06,211
or if I will ever be Queen.

226
00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:09,856
Probably neither.
But if I do become Queen,

227
00:44:10,394 --> 00:44:12,991
I swear to you now
on the Holy Gospels

228
00:44:13,158 --> 00:44:15,108
and on the soul of my mother,

229
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:18,414
that I will make England
faithful again.

230
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,575
I will do whatever it takes,

231
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,575
I will burn however many
heretics I have to,

232
00:44:24,742 --> 00:44:27,156
I will spill as much blood
as I have to,

233
00:44:27,443 --> 00:44:30,067
to make this unfortunate realm
Catholic again,

234
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:33,019
and heal it, so help me God.

235
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:54,859
May I?

236
00:45:11,242 --> 00:45:12,492
Take this ring,

237
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,345
in memory of me.

238
00:45:21,034 --> 00:45:23,184
It was a gift from the Emperor...

239
00:45:24,861 --> 00:45:27,011
Who received it from your mother.

240
00:46:05,154 --> 00:46:06,304
Your Majesty,

241
00:46:06,798 --> 00:46:08,648
we have received news that,

242
00:46:09,285 --> 00:46:12,920
as well as concluding his separate
peace treaty with the French at Crecy,

243
00:46:13,248 --> 00:46:17,239
the Emperor has given permission
for a marriage between his daughter

244
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:19,769
and the Duke of Orleans.

245
00:46:20,584 --> 00:46:21,584
All right.

246
00:46:26,027 --> 00:46:27,627
There is further news.

247
00:46:30,879 --> 00:46:32,929
We understand that the Dauphin

248
00:46:34,009 --> 00:46:36,442
and an army of over 36,000 men

249
00:46:36,609 --> 00:46:39,025
are preparing to march on Boulogne.

250
00:46:48,543 --> 00:46:51,809
I want my victory to be celebrated
in every house in England.

251
00:46:52,691 --> 00:46:55,915
It was, after all,
a very glorious affair.

252
00:46:58,136 --> 00:47:00,377
I want you to arrange
for every bell to be rung

253
00:47:01,496 --> 00:47:04,885
and a mass of Thanksgiving
to be said in every church.

254
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:08,430
I want the name "Boulogne"

255
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,409
imprinted on every English heart...

256
00:47:12,813 --> 00:47:14,413
just like Agincourt!

257
00:47:18,324 --> 00:47:19,910
Yes, your Majesty.
