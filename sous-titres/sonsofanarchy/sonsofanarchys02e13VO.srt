00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:02,668
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:03,067 --> 00:00:04,754
Edmond Hayes, Agent June Stahl.

3
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:08,591
I am willing to look past
all these illegal guns

4
00:00:08,716 --> 00:00:10,221
because I want James O'Phelan.

5
00:00:10,346 --> 00:00:12,637
Can't tie anything to Jimmy,
but my dad can.

6
00:00:13,444 --> 00:00:15,181
That's the four dozen AKs.

7
00:00:21,523 --> 00:00:24,148
Beating was from the League.
This is from me.

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,071
Mr. Weston does a lot of things
very well,

9
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,658
but understanding the need for this type
of relationship evades him.

10
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,256
This is the third delivery
you haven't let me pay for.

11
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:39,413
I am investing in the future
of your organization.

12
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:42,020
The night of Bobby's party,
I was attacked.

13
00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:44,377
- Girl says her baby's choking.
- Please help me.

14
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,882
Goddamn doll in the car seat.

15
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:49,131
I came to handcuffed
to a chain-link.

16
00:00:49,468 --> 00:00:52,176
There were three of them.
When he spoke, I knew his voice:

17
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:54,053
Zobelle's right hand, Weston.

18
00:00:54,352 --> 00:00:55,304
They raped me,

19
00:00:55,568 --> 00:00:56,764
all three of them.

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,686
This retaliation needs to be smart.
How do you want to handle it?

21
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:03,292
We kill them all.

22
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:05,919
Are you going to protect SAMCRO?

23
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:09,652
I'm going to help a friend.
Now, you do whatever you need to do.

24
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:12,814
Consider yourself acting chief.

25
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:14,198
Cliffie, Duke.

26
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:16,575
What the hell is this?
I'm their father.

27
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,441
See your kids have taken
that little trip I arranged.

28
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:21,956
Son of a bitch.
I'll kill you for this.

29
00:01:22,132 --> 00:01:24,163
At least I didn't gang-rape them.

30
00:01:24,288 --> 00:01:26,168
You want to kill me? Time and place.

31
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:28,099
Timberland, 8:00.

32
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:35,386
AJ Weston,
you're under arrest for arson,

33
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:36,804
burning down Caracara.

34
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,769
- Where's your father?
- I don't know.

35
00:01:39,894 --> 00:01:40,894
Polly?

36
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,780
Deputy Chief!

37
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:47,022
My daughter and I are
in possession of illegal narcotics.

38
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:49,391
- Arrest us.
- Come on. Let's go.

39
00:01:51,513 --> 00:01:52,820
We're going to kill you.

40
00:03:32,396 --> 00:03:33,396
What?

41
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:37,612
Stahl's been locked in a room with FBI,
two hours now.

42
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:39,749
No idea what's going on.

43
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,720
What about Weston?

44
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,130
Still waiting to hear from the DA.

45
00:03:46,563 --> 00:03:47,563
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:01,909
You should go on back to the clubhouse.
They going to need you there.

47
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,034
All right.

48
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:07,841
You come home to me.

49
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,894
- Sack, stay with my mom and Tara.
- Absolutely, man.

50
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:16,119
Thanks, bro.

51
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:20,593
All right?

52
00:04:30,992 --> 00:04:33,799
Our two-fingered witness,
Chuck Marstein?

53
00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:35,074
He's a felon,

54
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,275
history of fraud.

55
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,750
Unreliable witness.

56
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:40,761
Weston walks.

57
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:44,992
I am not handing
this guy over to Clay.

58
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,891
I need to talk to you.

59
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:55,589
Talk to my deputy. He's in charge.

60
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,629
Right this way.

61
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,900
What the hell happened in there?

62
00:05:08,115 --> 00:05:10,761
The FBI is cutting Zobelle loose.

63
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,686
Jesus Christ.

64
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,981
He had a key of heroin.

65
00:05:16,325 --> 00:05:17,925
Copped to trafficking.

66
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:19,589
This is bullshit.

67
00:05:19,772 --> 00:05:21,572
Welcome to my life, Wayne.

68
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:24,354
Please, please.

69
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:37,137
Zobelle is not just dealing
guns and dope.

70
00:05:41,445 --> 00:05:42,545
That scumbag

71
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,620
had Gemma Teller

72
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:47,699
beaten

73
00:05:48,363 --> 00:05:49,598
and gang-raped.

74
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:52,659
Jesus Christ.

75
00:05:53,546 --> 00:05:55,746
I need something to tell the club.

76
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:57,757
To tell Gemma.

77
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,426
This guy just skates away.

78
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:12,569
Ethan Zobelle...

79
00:06:13,436 --> 00:06:14,936
is an FBI informant.

80
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:17,533
A rat?

81
00:06:18,554 --> 00:06:20,054
For three years now.

82
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,177
He can tie the dirty deeds of his

83
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:25,602
organization to the rich and mighty.

84
00:06:26,238 --> 00:06:28,095
Judges, clergymen, a few senators.

85
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:32,392
As well as naming
the Aryan shot-callers.

86
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:35,918
He's a gold mine, and he knows it.

87
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:40,284
He keeps churning a profit
while the feds fatten their case.

88
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:44,592
No wonder this guy struts around
like King Farouk.

89
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,156
He's untouchable.

90
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:51,434
And the wheels of justice
keep turning.

91
00:06:52,452 --> 00:06:53,502
Don't they?

92
00:07:06,873 --> 00:07:07,973
Comfortable?

93
00:07:10,392 --> 00:07:11,392
What?

94
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:14,065
Bad news for law enforcement.

95
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,386
Weston and Zobelle are both walking.

96
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:20,219
How?

97
00:07:20,864 --> 00:07:23,014
Chucky's testimony don't hold up.

98
00:07:23,549 --> 00:07:26,649
And Zobelle
has been working for the FBI

99
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:28,030
all along.

100
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:29,782
A rat?

101
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:33,876
Trading senators
and A.B. shot-callers.

102
00:07:37,553 --> 00:07:38,332
Thanks.

103
00:07:42,537 --> 00:07:43,637
Get to Otto.

104
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:47,856
Have him send word up the ranks.
Gets us protected inside again,

105
00:07:47,981 --> 00:07:50,781
stops any Aryan backlash
once we drop Weston.

106
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:57,338
- Weston's mine.
- I know.

107
00:08:14,175 --> 00:08:15,702
My guys will escort you

108
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,990
wherever you need to go.

109
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:21,439
That won't be necessary.

110
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:47,394
Holy shit.

111
00:08:48,124 --> 00:08:49,168
Alvarez.

112
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:51,738
Brown's protecting
their investment, huh?

113
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:17,388
There's not going to be
another battle in Charming.

114
00:09:29,676 --> 00:09:30,676
Too late.

115
00:09:31,342 --> 00:09:32,942
War's already started.

116
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,990
<i>Riding through this world</i>

117
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:38,869

126
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,817
Episode 213: Na Triobloidi

127
00:10:25,414 --> 00:10:27,214
Not gonna wash your hands?

128
00:10:29,736 --> 00:10:32,686
Ain't you wondering
why your boss was locked up?

129
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:35,619
Why he ain't now?

130
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:38,531
He's not my boss

131
00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:40,876
or my concern.

132
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:45,039
I'd probably feel the same way,

133
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:47,688
if I found out I was working
for a rat.

134
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,899
Guy in the suit
that walked them out of here?

135
00:10:51,257 --> 00:10:52,657
He's not a lawyer.

136
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,241
FBI handler.

137
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:02,369
Informant?

138
00:11:03,868 --> 00:11:04,968
Three years.

139
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:08,143
We can't touch him.

140
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:11,961
Why are you telling me this?

141
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:18,010
The hate you got
in your heart for color,

142
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:20,691
multiply it by ten,

143
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,531
point it at yourself and Zobelle,

144
00:11:24,755 --> 00:11:26,405
and hang my name on it.

145
00:11:28,624 --> 00:11:31,964
I hope you rip each other to shreds.

146
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,370
We were just saying our good-byes.

147
00:11:46,844 --> 00:11:48,644
Eyewitness was unreliable.

148
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,851
DA is not pursuing the charges.

149
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,486
You're free to go.

150
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:02,971
I can't prove what you did
to Gemma Teller.

151
00:12:03,426 --> 00:12:04,928
And handing you over to Clay

152
00:12:05,053 --> 00:12:07,745
would be a satisfying consolation.

153
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:11,192
But fortunately for you,

154
00:12:12,116 --> 00:12:14,779
I'm a cop actually bound by the law.

155
00:12:15,294 --> 00:12:16,544
You stay local,

156
00:12:17,175 --> 00:12:18,725
SAMCRO will kill you.

157
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,157
I can't leave without my boys.

158
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:25,719
Maybe I can arrange a visit.

159
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:37,137
How you getting by?

160
00:12:43,084 --> 00:12:44,178
10% vision.

161
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:49,132
It's lightened the work detail.

162
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:52,900
Resigned to

163
00:12:53,551 --> 00:12:54,751
books on tape.

164
00:12:56,834 --> 00:12:58,884
It's time for retribution, bro.

165
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:06,243
We got some intel the Aryan shot-callers
are gonna wanna know.

166
00:13:51,303 --> 00:13:52,453
Who was that?

167
00:13:52,808 --> 00:13:53,808
Weston.

168
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:56,578
He knows you're working
with the FBI.

169
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:58,699
Said you're a dead man.

170
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:03,842
What do we do, Dad?

171
00:14:04,336 --> 00:14:05,724
Adjust and adapt

172
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,540
like we always do.

173
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:08,965
When I became...

174
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:11,766
obliged to the FBI,

175
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,847
it was inevitable
that my shift in alliances

176
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:16,322
would be exposed.

177
00:14:16,553 --> 00:14:17,803
We're prepared.

178
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:19,479
Witness protection?

179
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:22,731
WitPro is a fantasy.
It was never an option.

180
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,783
We'll go home,

181
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:26,714
we'll regroup.

182
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,243
God will lead us
to the next right place.

183
00:14:32,992 --> 00:14:33,992
Home?

184
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,210
- Budapest?
- We'll be safe and comfortable there.

185
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,378
I'll have a chance to rebuild.

186
00:14:41,678 --> 00:14:44,124
It won't take long for this news
to get out on the streets.

187
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:47,549
When it does, our Mexican cohorts
will not be compelled

188
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,088
to give us assistance.
We should leave now.

189
00:14:51,393 --> 00:14:54,425
I will charter a jet
out of Sacramento.

190
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,041
Today?

191
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,090
We have no choice.

192
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:02,696
- I have to go back to the house.
- Why?

193
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:05,401
Pack.

194
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:07,280
All my stuff is here.

195
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,066
I just can't leave.

196
00:15:11,553 --> 00:15:13,245
You're going to see him.

197
00:15:17,802 --> 00:15:18,802
I have to.

198
00:15:19,561 --> 00:15:21,294
You're smarter than that.

199
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,422
I have done everything
you've asked me to. Everything!

200
00:15:28,901 --> 00:15:30,251
I believe in you.

201
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:32,419
I love you.

202
00:15:33,987 --> 00:15:35,587
But I need to do this.

203
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,376
I'll be back in an hour.

204
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:19,792
So where we at?

205
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:21,594
I cleared out Floyd

206
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:24,669
and everyone else
in the potential line of fire.

207
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,019
Look,

208
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:28,778
helping SAMCRO, it's about Gemma.
I get it.

209
00:16:28,903 --> 00:16:31,503
But if these guys open up
on Main Street,

210
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:33,554
I gotta call the sheriff.

211
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:36,202
This is Charming business.

212
00:16:36,888 --> 00:16:38,038
Look at this.

213
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,089
If this goes south,
we can't contain it, all right?

214
00:16:41,214 --> 00:16:44,127
It's the goddamn Wild West.
You put me in charge. I'm calling.

215
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:01,144
Downloaded Otto.

216
00:17:03,374 --> 00:17:05,633
Weston out yet?

217
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:08,401
Hale's got Eglee to give him
an escort out of town.

218
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,363
Making a stop to
see his kids first...

219
00:17:11,683 --> 00:17:13,198
Sanwa CFS.

220
00:17:15,586 --> 00:17:17,786
I'll catch him at Family Services.

221
00:17:18,322 --> 00:17:19,922
No harm to my officer.

222
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,523
Let's go, brother.

223
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,709
And me.

224
00:17:25,005 --> 00:17:27,128
I'll handle the rest.

225
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,779
Stop right there.
That's far enough.

226
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,016
Just want a discussion, man.

227
00:18:01,303 --> 00:18:02,353
He's clean.

228
00:18:19,344 --> 00:18:21,198
Don't know
what the drama's all about, <i>ese</i>.

229
00:18:21,323 --> 00:18:23,114
Just buying a few cigars.

230
00:18:23,377 --> 00:18:24,644
Our truce?

231
00:18:25,486 --> 00:18:26,686
Null and void.

232
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:29,941
You need to buy cigars
someplace else.

233
00:18:30,865 --> 00:18:32,415
I'm not staying long.

234
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:34,732
Just showing
a new friend out of town.

235
00:18:34,857 --> 00:18:36,156
Your new friend...

236
00:18:37,073 --> 00:18:38,323
he hurt my club

237
00:18:39,145 --> 00:18:41,411
and my town and my family.

238
00:18:42,082 --> 00:18:44,831
You got no idea
who you crawled into bed with.

239
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:48,869
Send your crew home, Clay.

240
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:51,326
Let me do what I gotta do.

241
00:18:53,324 --> 00:18:54,841
Or I'll call in another charter

242
00:18:55,404 --> 00:18:58,470
and we can turn Main Street
into Dia de los Muertos

243
00:19:10,068 --> 00:19:12,618
Why didn't you tell
him Zobelle's a rat?

244
00:19:13,163 --> 00:19:14,815
'Cause he'd kill him...

245
00:19:16,183 --> 00:19:17,483
and that's mine.

246
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:26,289
<i>Intellect throws each man
back upon himself</i>

247
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:30,591
<i>into a solitude from which he looks out
with absolutely strange eyes on society.</i>

248
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:33,801
<i>And if the spectacle touches him,</i>

249
00:19:33,926 --> 00:19:36,376
<i>if it arouses interest
and compassion,</i>

250
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,544
<i>his feeling will be for those
tender ones of the great human flock</i>

251
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:44,390
<i>whom the shepherds shear
and starve and sell</i>

252
00:19:45,326 --> 00:19:46,684
<i>and do not feed.</i>

253
00:19:47,343 --> 00:19:50,993
<i>Imperfect education makes
the rank-and-file of revolutionists,</i>

254
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,790
<i>but from time to time,</i>

255
00:19:52,915 --> 00:19:56,209
<i>a leader steps down to them
out of the highest circles:</i>

256
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:57,398
<i>a Mirabeau,</i>

257
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:58,959
<i>a Rochefort,</i>

258
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:00,534
<i>a Prince Kropotkin.</i>

259
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,634
<i>The desire of the Sons of Anarchy
is indeed</i>

260
00:20:03,842 --> 00:20:05,592
<i>to dispense with leaders;</i>

261
00:20:05,717 --> 00:20:07,664
<i>for since all men
in the formula are equal,</i>

262
00:20:08,044 --> 00:20:11,594
<i>it is unreasonable that one
should lead rather than another.</i>

263
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:15,630
The beating was from SAMCRO.

264
00:20:16,903 --> 00:20:17,674
This

265
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:19,289
is from me.

266
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:32,772
<i>You've reached the end of side one.</i>

267
00:20:34,305 --> 00:20:36,192
<i>Please turn over the tape.</i>

268
00:20:44,506 --> 00:20:45,556
Here we go.

269
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,100
What the hell's he doing
with the kid?

270
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,920
Shit,

271
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,038
he's taking the kid with him.

272
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,940
Call Unser,
find out what's going on.

273
00:21:36,372 --> 00:21:37,551
Your cell's ringing.

274
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:38,995
Get out here.

275
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,097
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

276
00:21:49,451 --> 00:21:50,451
Go.

277
00:21:54,103 --> 00:21:55,073
Hello.

278
00:21:55,198 --> 00:21:56,362
<i>Eddy, it's Da.</i>

279
00:21:56,487 --> 00:21:59,105
- Da, where the hell have...
- Just listen, boy.

280
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,504
Picked up a tail.

281
00:22:00,629 --> 00:22:01,879
Got to be feds.

282
00:22:02,017 --> 00:22:03,279
Probably on you, too.

283
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,059
<i>Meet at the place.</i>

284
00:22:05,382 --> 00:22:07,408
<i>We'll talk safe.</i>
<i>One hour.</i>

285
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:15,875
No trace.

286
00:22:17,312 --> 00:22:19,187
Wants to meet at the wharf.

287
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:26,177
Let's go.

288
00:22:33,597 --> 00:22:34,800
It's time.

289
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,299
Let's make the Mexicans
feel welcome.

290
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:45,448
You and the Nomads keep an eye
on things. Rest of us, clubhouse.

291
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,698
Call you when they get restless.

292
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:08,248
Would be a good time to take our ride.
We have to wait for Polly.

293
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,807
I'm all about family,

294
00:23:11,035 --> 00:23:13,182
but Clay ain't the kind of guy
that rolls over.

295
00:23:13,797 --> 00:23:15,799
May not get this window again.

296
00:23:20,168 --> 00:23:21,168
We wait.

297
00:23:33,961 --> 00:23:35,011
Okay, cool.

298
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,876
So they gave Weston
a supervised visit with his kid...

299
00:23:40,983 --> 00:23:42,733
Unser's cop as chaperone.

300
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,638
And he took them for ink.

301
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:46,572
Perfect.

302
00:23:47,332 --> 00:23:49,472
Guess little Cliffie couldn't go.

303
00:23:49,597 --> 00:23:50,845
He's in a psych eval.

304
00:23:52,884 --> 00:23:53,988
Go figure.

305
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:59,937
Weston, two inkers, two customers,
the kid, and the cop.

306
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,810
Freddy a friend?

307
00:24:02,253 --> 00:24:03,303
I think so.

308
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:06,111
We got to get Weston
away from his kid.

309
00:24:07,569 --> 00:24:08,769
Make the call.

310
00:24:19,154 --> 00:24:20,804
Can you get that, baby?

311
00:24:27,302 --> 00:24:29,842
- <i>This is Freddy.</i>
- It's Opie, SAMCRO.

312
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,330
<i>Need a favor.</i>

313
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,045
<i>Guy on your table, club wants him.</i>

314
00:24:34,621 --> 00:24:36,224
<i>Raped a member's mother.</i>

315
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:39,192
Need to get him clear
of the kid and the cop.

316
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,887
<i>In five minutes,</i>

317
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,562
<i>give him a reason
to go to the bathroom.</i>

318
00:24:44,582 --> 00:24:46,582
<i>Think you can do that, Freddy?</i>

319
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,917
I got no problem with that.

320
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:50,642
<i>Club will owe you one.</i>

321
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:52,698
Come on. Let's go.

322
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:57,733
Good?

323
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,260
- Come on.
- Sorry, man.

324
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:15,012
We're okay.
You should go rinse that off though.

325
00:25:20,805 --> 00:25:22,105
You got to piss?

326
00:25:25,318 --> 00:25:26,315
Shit.

327
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,779
Jesus.

328
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,324
It's okay, Dukey.

329
00:25:41,111 --> 00:25:42,361
Get rid of him.

330
00:25:46,026 --> 00:25:47,060
Head back, Dukey.

331
00:25:47,185 --> 00:25:49,085
I got to talk to these guys.

332
00:25:49,431 --> 00:25:50,715
Say nothing,

333
00:25:51,225 --> 00:25:52,875
no matter what happens.

334
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,327
Understand?

335
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,096
You don't ever talk to the cops.

336
00:25:59,526 --> 00:26:00,576
I love you.

337
00:26:15,864 --> 00:26:17,366
He never sees this.

338
00:27:22,198 --> 00:27:23,198
Da.

339
00:27:23,528 --> 00:27:24,725
ATF has me.

340
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,290
Go.

341
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:31,902
Said they're gonna tell Jimmy
I was a rat. I didn't help!

342
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,319
<i>Listen to me, boy.</i>

343
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,320
Got to convince Jimmy you'd do
anything for the cause.

344
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,020
- What do I do?
- Kill that ATF bitch.

345
00:27:41,145 --> 00:27:43,543
Don't care how you do it.
Just get it done.

346
00:27:43,668 --> 00:27:45,678
How do I...?
She's a fed.

347
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,498
This is the call, boy.

348
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,788
This is you being a man.

349
00:27:50,255 --> 00:27:51,897
Figure it out.
Do it.

350
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,046
Let me know when it's done.

351
00:28:08,377 --> 00:28:12,313
Very, very sneaky, Eddy.
Very sneaky and very stupid.

352
00:28:12,438 --> 00:28:14,301
It's the only way
I could get him to come in.

353
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,814
Told him the safe house was clear.

354
00:28:17,181 --> 00:28:18,738
Gonna meet me there, one hour.

355
00:28:19,082 --> 00:28:20,171
Good boy.

356
00:28:22,363 --> 00:28:23,934
My Da's smart.

357
00:28:24,263 --> 00:28:26,213
He's got scanners, detectors.

358
00:28:26,726 --> 00:28:29,415
He sees anyone, hears anything,
he'll know it's a trap.

359
00:28:30,694 --> 00:28:33,501
I can't exactly trust you alone,
now can I?

360
00:28:35,746 --> 00:28:36,946
Then just you.

361
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:39,495
No one else.

362
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:44,514
Let's go.

363
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,780
It's done.

364
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,374
I am so proud of you.

365
00:29:12,699 --> 00:29:13,699
Me, too.

366
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:32,499
Where we at?

367
00:29:33,012 --> 00:29:34,980
Puerto Rican's watching Zobelle.

368
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,625
Where's my mom?

369
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,739
Her and Tara are getting supplies.

370
00:29:42,327 --> 00:29:43,677
Sack's with them.

371
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:53,254
You're a good son.

372
00:29:56,311 --> 00:29:57,128
Sons.

373
00:31:27,448 --> 00:31:28,844
Give me those.

374
00:31:31,131 --> 00:31:32,231
I'm driving.

375
00:31:47,662 --> 00:31:48,762
That blonde.

376
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:52,868
She's the one you chased.

377
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,920
Who is she, Gemma?

378
00:32:00,925 --> 00:32:02,878
Zobelle's daughter.

379
00:32:03,665 --> 00:32:06,565
She's the one who told me
her baby was choking.

380
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,842
Hit me over the head.

381
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:14,848
Where are we going?

382
00:32:15,698 --> 00:32:17,198
Forward, sweetheart.

383
00:32:38,318 --> 00:32:39,518
You take milk?

384
00:32:39,777 --> 00:32:41,377
Think I might be sick.

385
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:46,299
Go.

386
00:33:39,807 --> 00:33:41,644
What are you going to do with that?

387
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:43,312
Box you put me in...

388
00:33:44,378 --> 00:33:46,152
you give me no choice.

389
00:33:58,192 --> 00:33:59,662
Put the gun down.

390
00:34:06,822 --> 00:34:08,754
Jesus!
What the...?

391
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:09,922
Blanks.

392
00:34:11,018 --> 00:34:12,818
We knew the gun was there.

393
00:34:13,175 --> 00:34:15,825
Knew that the cell phone
was at the wharf.

394
00:34:16,063 --> 00:34:18,163
We've been one step ahead, Eddy.

395
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,097
And now

396
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:26,057
I'm going to send Daddy a text

397
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:28,412
from your phone,

398
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:32,791
telling him that I am dead
and that it's safe

399
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:35,505
to come round and pick you up.

400
00:34:36,807 --> 00:34:39,007
Why'd you let me take it this far?

401
00:34:40,586 --> 00:34:42,674
Could've just told me,
sent the text.

402
00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:43,831
I was curious.

403
00:34:44,491 --> 00:34:46,741
Wanted to see if you had the balls.

404
00:34:47,075 --> 00:34:48,484
But you didn't.

405
00:34:49,323 --> 00:34:52,373
I guess Da raised a little Irish pussy,
didn't he?

406
00:35:15,497 --> 00:35:16,497
Shit.

407
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,132
<i>We heard shots on the wire.</i>

408
00:35:31,257 --> 00:35:33,576
<i>Need a status update.
Over.</i>

409
00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:44,939
Those were the blanks.

410
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:48,261
I guess old Edmond here
had the nerve after all.

411
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:51,148
I sent a message to Cameron,

412
00:35:52,095 --> 00:35:55,005
so keep the streets clear
and disengage the wire.

413
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,480
Go radio silence.

414
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:59,882
I don't want a scanner
or a $20 RF detector

415
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:01,769
tanking this operation.

416
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,275
We got to go.

417
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,612
Now.

418
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:38,003
She'll be back soon.

419
00:36:38,128 --> 00:36:40,267
I got guys out there
with outstanding warrants.

420
00:36:40,392 --> 00:36:43,951
Those sheriffs start running plates,
you're going to lose half your escort.

421
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:21,769
What are we doing here, Gemma?

422
00:37:34,616 --> 00:37:35,625
That rape

423
00:37:36,433 --> 00:37:39,922
would have destroyed most women,
but it made you

424
00:37:40,623 --> 00:37:44,036
stronger, wiser, compassionate.

425
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:47,948
Whatever it is you think
you have to do, you're past it.

426
00:37:51,513 --> 00:37:52,656
My son.

427
00:37:53,343 --> 00:37:54,393
My husband.

428
00:37:55,312 --> 00:37:56,562
Their brothers.

429
00:37:57,557 --> 00:37:59,949
They're out there
risking their lives,

430
00:38:00,074 --> 00:38:01,224
their freedom

431
00:38:01,955 --> 00:38:02,955
for me.

432
00:38:05,972 --> 00:38:07,722
This is how I do my part.

433
00:38:10,175 --> 00:38:12,575
God's put her in my path,
so I can...

434
00:38:13,061 --> 00:38:15,711
fix that part of me
that they ripped open.

435
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,495
I'm supposed to do this.

436
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:20,499
Jesus.

437
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:26,011
- Do you even hear what you're saying?
- Get my grandson home safe.

438
00:38:27,956 --> 00:38:29,206
Love you, Tara.

439
00:38:30,937 --> 00:38:32,434
I'm glad you're with my boy.

440
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:35,452
- Gemma, please don't do this.
- I'll be okay.

441
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,340
I'll be okay.

442
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,654
Where's she going?

443
00:39:03,232 --> 00:39:05,892
Stay here.
She may need to get out fast.

444
00:39:14,845 --> 00:39:15,686
Edmond?

445
00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:22,175
Eddy?

446
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,236
It's me.

447
00:39:32,582 --> 00:39:33,996
Edmond, are you here?

448
00:39:37,438 --> 00:39:38,638
Where are you?

449
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,800
Oh, God.

450
00:40:20,055 --> 00:40:21,126
Put down the gun.

451
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,577
You're the one that killed him.

452
00:40:32,899 --> 00:40:33,999
Turn around.

453
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,310
Turn around!

454
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:27,821
Bloody day for both of us.

455
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:30,915
Push the gun on the floor.

456
00:41:50,906 --> 00:41:52,856
Was she involved in the rape?

457
00:41:57,617 --> 00:41:59,917
I'm sorry that that happened to you.

458
00:42:01,973 --> 00:42:03,523
And now what happens?

459
00:42:12,992 --> 00:42:13,992
Go.

460
00:42:16,306 --> 00:42:18,706
I'll give you some time
to slip away.

461
00:42:20,814 --> 00:42:22,414
Why would you do that?

462
00:42:23,015 --> 00:42:25,792
At least see your family
before we pick you up.

463
00:42:27,465 --> 00:42:30,315
But head out the back.
Avoid my guys in front.

464
00:42:34,962 --> 00:42:36,662
I'm giving you a chance.

465
00:42:37,262 --> 00:42:38,262
Go.

466
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,970
What are you doing?

467
00:42:49,566 --> 00:42:51,516
You need to put down the gun.

468
00:42:57,724 --> 00:42:58,724
Goddamn.

469
00:43:02,582 --> 00:43:04,182
You are a smart bitch.

470
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:07,817
Clock's ticking, darling.

471
00:43:38,455 --> 00:43:40,455
This is Stahl.
Status update.

472
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,100
Cameron Hayes never showed.

473
00:43:44,645 --> 00:43:46,895
The girlfriend, Polly Zobelle, did.

474
00:43:48,157 --> 00:43:50,395
<i>I told Edmond to get rid of her,</i>

475
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:54,859
<i>but before he could,
Clay Morrow's old lady followed her in,</i>

476
00:43:54,984 --> 00:43:55,986
<i>armed.</i>

477
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:58,330
<i>She sucker-punched me,</i>

478
00:43:58,455 --> 00:44:01,772
<i>took my gun,
shot the girl in the chest.</i>

479
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:06,141
<i>Edmond panicked, ran for the door.</i>

480
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,750
<i>Gemma shot him in the back
with my weapon.</i>

481
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,520
<i>He's dead.</i>

482
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:14,676
<i>She took off.</i>

483
00:44:15,669 --> 00:44:17,169
<i>I couldn't stop her.</i>

484
00:44:18,334 --> 00:44:19,734
Oh, Mother Mary...

485
00:44:26,037 --> 00:44:27,069
My boy!

486
00:44:59,295 --> 00:45:01,114
<i>No sign of any suspects in the yard.</i>

487
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:20,129
We're going, with or without you.

488
00:45:20,254 --> 00:45:21,254
I'm ready.

489
00:45:21,755 --> 00:45:22,955
Can you please

490
00:45:23,924 --> 00:45:25,774
leave one of your men here?

491
00:45:26,613 --> 00:45:28,263
In case Polly shows up.

492
00:46:29,635 --> 00:46:31,285
It's ready and waiting.

493
00:47:13,533 --> 00:47:14,533
Wayne.

494
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,717
I need a little help.

495
00:47:18,173 --> 00:47:19,917
What's the matter, darling?

496
00:47:20,042 --> 00:47:21,242
Where are you?

497
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:24,715
I'm on the lam.

498
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,169
We've got company.

499
00:48:38,895 --> 00:48:40,677
Alvarez, take off!

500
00:48:41,851 --> 00:48:43,251
Or we finish this.

501
00:48:44,439 --> 00:48:45,439
Let's go.

502
00:48:47,408 --> 00:48:48,858
Go get King Whitey.

503
00:49:01,685 --> 00:49:05,222
Okay, kids. Go grab a snack.
Behave yourselves.

504
00:49:20,693 --> 00:49:21,943
That's his car.

505
00:49:30,432 --> 00:49:31,582
Check it out.

506
00:49:35,983 --> 00:49:36,983
Hey, kids.

507
00:49:54,963 --> 00:49:58,213
He's in there. He's surrounded
with a busload of kids.

508
00:49:58,534 --> 00:50:01,484
Probably calling for backup.
Maybe the sheriffs.

509
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:03,833
- Who gives a shit?
- Those kids clear...

510
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,000
we kill him.

511
00:50:16,245 --> 00:50:17,395
It's just me.

512
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,016
- Where's Gemma?
- I don't know.

513
00:50:20,743 --> 00:50:22,810
Feds raided the house.
I had to leave.

514
00:50:26,506 --> 00:50:28,006
You better call Jax.

515
00:50:49,523 --> 00:50:51,834
I didn't want
to bother you with this...

516
00:50:51,959 --> 00:50:52,882
What?

517
00:50:54,446 --> 00:50:56,844
It's Gemma. She followed
Zobelle's daughter in the...

518
00:51:05,387 --> 00:51:06,387
What...?

519
00:51:11,479 --> 00:51:14,079
- What?
- Something's wrong. I got to go.

520
00:51:17,624 --> 00:51:20,224
- I'm with you, brother.
- Yeah, me, too.

521
00:51:30,513 --> 00:51:31,513
Weapon.

522
00:51:33,183 --> 00:51:34,633
What are you doing?

523
00:51:36,704 --> 00:51:38,054
What do you want?

524
00:51:39,324 --> 00:51:40,638
Gemma killed my Eddy.

525
00:51:42,753 --> 00:51:43,953
Figured maybe,

526
00:51:45,281 --> 00:51:47,531
I kill an old lady, even the score.

527
00:51:49,307 --> 00:51:51,043
Don't get brave, boyo.

528
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:56,404
Sit.

529
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:20,816
Here we are.

530
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,467
Son for a son.

531
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:30,890
Seems about right.

532
00:52:36,408 --> 00:52:38,397
Please, no!

533
00:52:42,635 --> 00:52:43,635
Wait.

534
00:53:33,169 --> 00:53:34,369
Line 1, Chief.

535
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:41,045
<i>Clay and his men attacked me.</i>

536
00:53:41,326 --> 00:53:44,888
I am trapped.
Deli Mart, Tyler Creek and Stallion.

537
00:53:45,683 --> 00:53:48,383
<i>Bad day for the Zobelles
to leave Charming.</i>

538
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:51,046
Feds found your daughter

539
00:53:51,171 --> 00:53:54,262
shot to death
in some shithole in Galt.

540
00:54:01,108 --> 00:54:03,558
I'll get the sheriffs
right out there.

541
00:54:05,939 --> 00:54:07,789
You want the Sanwa Sheriff?

542
00:54:15,594 --> 00:54:17,794
That's it.
Kids are finishing up.

543
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:24,390
Convince the locals
to buy their snacks someplace else.

544
00:54:26,155 --> 00:54:29,005
- Tell the deli clerk to take a break.
- Done.

545
00:54:37,195 --> 00:54:38,196
My baby!

546
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:42,711
Oh, Jesus Christ.

547
00:54:45,962 --> 00:54:47,112
Are you okay?

548
00:54:47,555 --> 00:54:48,916
He took Abel.

549
00:54:50,964 --> 00:54:51,964
What?

550
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,590
- Who took him?
- That Irishman I patched up.

551
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:58,458
Cameron.

552
00:55:20,782 --> 00:55:22,332
Everything all right?

553
00:55:23,454 --> 00:55:24,504
I need you.

554
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:38,859
We got to go.

555
00:55:38,984 --> 00:55:41,165
What are you talking about?
Zobelle's unprotected.

556
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:42,940
Irish took my grandson.

557
00:55:44,027 --> 00:55:45,506
Son of a bitch!

558
00:56:54,078 --> 00:56:55,119
I got this.

559
00:57:01,586 --> 00:57:03,986
Is it just you, then,
this afternoon?

560
00:57:04,226 --> 00:57:08,053
My... daughter
will not be joining me.

561
00:57:08,662 --> 00:57:09,862
Oh, I'm sorry.

562
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:11,393
Well...

563
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:13,330
We...

564
00:57:14,158 --> 00:57:15,158
adjust

565
00:57:15,871 --> 00:57:18,155
and adapt, yes?

566
00:57:57,778 --> 00:57:59,412
Local police struck out.

567
00:57:59,537 --> 00:58:01,587
Looks like Gemma's in the wind.

568
00:58:12,802 --> 00:58:14,702
Any idea where we're headed?

569
00:59:10,058 --> 00:59:11,058
Far dock!

570
00:59:53,704 --> 00:59:54,954
He took my son.

571
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:56,808
He took my son!

572
