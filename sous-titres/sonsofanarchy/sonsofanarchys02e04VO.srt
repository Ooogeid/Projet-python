<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,496 --> 00:00:04,503
We know you still got
an ATF target on your back.

3
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:07,590
You really think it's safe filling
this new space with illegal gun parts?

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,051
We sell, ship, store.
You load your saddlebags, deliver.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,511
Charter to charter. Give you 20%.

6
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:15,322
MC Pony Express
is going to cost you 28%.

7
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:18,701
- Call a vote, prez.
- All in favor?

8
00:00:20,573 --> 00:00:21,395
Deal.

9
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:24,065
- You and Clay. Guys are worried.
- Nothing to worry about.

10
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:25,191
Convince me.

11
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,568
- Who are you?
- We feel it would be best

12
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:30,947
if you stop dealing arms
to the One-Niners and the Mayans.

13
00:00:31,116 --> 00:00:33,991
- You're done selling guns to color.
- Nobody threatens Samcro...

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,117
Black, brown,

15
00:00:35,513 --> 00:00:36,513
or white.

16
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:40,539
- Who the hell's that?
- Friend of Darby's.

17
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,358
Nothing to worry about.

18
00:00:42,654 --> 00:00:46,104
My baby swallowed something!
He's choking! Please help me!

19
00:00:48,676 --> 00:00:50,943
We need you to pass on a message
to your old man.

20
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:53,448
Tell him to stop selling guns
to niggers and wetbacks

21
00:00:53,573 --> 00:00:55,874
or we find you and we do this again.

22
00:00:56,876 --> 00:00:58,933
- Oh, my god!
- Get me out of here.

23
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:01,018
Promise me. You won't tell anyone.

24
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:03,771
- We gotta tell Clay.
- Not Clay. Not Jax.

25
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:04,855
No one.

26
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:12,821
Shit!

27
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,639
Let me. Come on.

28
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:28,838
Right.

29
00:01:31,113 --> 00:01:32,113
There.

30
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:35,931
Cortisone helping?

31
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:38,598
I'm fine without it.

32
00:01:39,904 --> 00:01:40,904
I know.

33
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:49,175
Good.

34
00:01:51,342 --> 00:01:52,565
When you back?

35
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,590
Tomorrow.

36
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:00,298
Be safe.

37
00:02:02,053 --> 00:02:03,053
Thanks.

38
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,730
Maybe some time away will help you.

39
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,380
Get past whatever this is.

40
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:21,457
Maybe.

41
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,611
What's the run?

42
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,880
Blood drive,

43
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:37,521
children's hospital in Eureka.

44
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:41,129
Samcro community servants.

45
00:02:41,515 --> 00:02:43,329
That's what we're all about, baby.

46
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,868
My boy, the master of timing.

47
00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:13,914
I love you.

48
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:17,961
I love you, too.

49
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:22,899
I got him.

50
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:46,537
Here we go.

51
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:48,854
I know.

52
00:03:57,564 --> 00:03:58,564
What?

53
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:02,675
I'm your old lady.

54
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:10,824
Come on.
Let's get you some breakfast.

55
00:04:21,665 --> 00:04:22,673
We got it all?

56
00:04:22,798 --> 00:04:24,948
Yeah, we got our eat for tonight.

57
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:32,849
- Didn't know you were riding.
- Clay wants me on the relay.

58
00:04:33,963 --> 00:04:35,232
Mary with the kids?

59
00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:37,503
My kids are fine, Jax.

60
00:04:41,427 --> 00:04:43,227
Chitty, chitty, bang bang.

61
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:44,601
All right.

62
00:04:46,126 --> 00:04:48,329
It's an old fat boy
on an old fat boy.

63
00:04:48,961 --> 00:04:51,832
- Sorry.
- Thought you put that beast to sleep.

64
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:53,743
This fat boy ain't even reached
its prime.

65
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:55,839
Barely looks like it can reach
the end of the lot.

66
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:57,764
Best bike for a long ride.

67
00:04:58,076 --> 00:05:01,050
And I put it up against
any of your pretty Dynas.

68
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:03,510
You hitting a gay rodeo on the way?

69
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,780
It's captain chaps.

70
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:08,515
Cowhide protects the man hide.

71
00:05:08,734 --> 00:05:10,059
Get in line, Brokeback.

72
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,484
- Oh, man.
- Shit.

73
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:15,609
Really?

74
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,490
Goddamn, man.
Come on, I gotta ride behind that thing?

75
00:05:19,615 --> 00:05:20,615
Shut up.

76
00:05:21,151 --> 00:05:23,190
You should be used
to getting sprayed in the face.

77
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:25,587
- Usually by Bobby.
- Eat me, Chibs.

78
00:05:25,712 --> 00:05:29,462
See, the thing is, I like a full scrote
when I snack on someone.

79
00:05:29,964 --> 00:05:31,164
Is that right?

80
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,752
- Pretty soon you can have that.
- You gonna spontaneously sprout a nut?

81
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,060
What, what, what, what?

82
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,207
- Getting a Neuticle.
- Getting a what?

83
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:45,904
You're getting a musical?

84
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:48,028
- Musical?
- A fake ball. A Neuticle.

85
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:50,712
It's an implant.
Give me a sense of symmetry.

86
00:05:50,837 --> 00:05:51,837
Balance.

87
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,186
Are you for real?

88
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:56,232
I'm just waiting
for the VA insurance to clear.

89
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,735
You're getting a glass ball?

90
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,516
No, no, it's not glass.
It's like a...

91
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:01,860
- What is it?
- Like it feels real, like a...

92
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,363
- Hard-boiled egg?
- Soft, you know, squishy.

93
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:06,198
Like it's... No, like a real ball.

94
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:12,842
I don't even know... Come on.
I don't even know what that means.

95
00:06:13,146 --> 00:06:14,796
It's modern technology.

96
00:06:15,856 --> 00:06:17,701
I'm trying to be open here, okay?

97
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:19,586
Okay, real mature, guys.

98
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:23,528
You're a class act, Chibs.

99
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,590
What?

100
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:27,937
You don't want to know. Really.

101
00:06:31,217 --> 00:06:32,867
Shoulder gonna hold up?

102
00:06:33,205 --> 00:06:34,705
The shoulder's good.

103
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,941
Appreciate you taking care
of the garage while I'm gone.

104
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,211
No problem.

105
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:45,738
Tell the boys they can log some OT.
I don't want to get buried.

106
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,230
I'll keep an eye on her.

107
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:50,751
- I know she's been...
- She's fine.

108
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:53,967
You just worry about the cars.

109
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:56,887
Got my full attention.

110
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:09,074

Military surplus shop is cover.
Wish we thought of that.

00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:27,785
That's Edmond. Boy's a genius.

- Ten guns in each.

127

Roll it up, strap it on.

128
00:09:39,197 --> 00:09:40,780
Just a biker with a bedroll.

129
00:09:40,905 --> 00:09:42,555
Six riders, five dozen.

130
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,906
That's a good haul.

131
00:09:44,031 --> 00:09:46,251

- The thirty-two,

Anything I can do?

Hunt down the keys
to the gold Sebring.

151
00:10:53,657 --> 00:10:56,407
Sure, darling.
Right this way, sweet cheeks.

You looking for Sherman's?

154
00:11:54,441 --> 00:11:56,091
They closed last month.

155
00:11:57,381 --> 00:11:59,081
Hope it wasn't a return.

156
00:12:16,308 --> 00:12:17,458
Sorry, ma'am.

157
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:43,518
Excuse me. Are you leaving?

158
00:12:52,928 --> 00:12:54,606
Are you leaving or what?

159
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:00,692
Shit!

160
00:14:04,415 --> 00:14:05,385
Who's down?

161
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:18,857
- Tig, you all right?
- Shit, Tig.

162
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:40,779
Got a disturbing call from a woman
says you pulled a gun on her?

163
00:14:45,123 --> 00:14:46,123
That's it?

164
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:47,409
Just "Yeah"?

165
00:14:48,497 --> 00:14:49,947
I didn't shoot her.

166
00:14:52,312 --> 00:14:54,851
What the hell
am I supposed to do with that?

167
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:02,846
You gonna hit a bank or something?

168
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,871
That's what they were wearing.

169
00:15:06,996 --> 00:15:07,996
Who?

170
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,673
Jesus.

171
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:14,619
Someone dropped it
in our mailbox today.

172
00:15:14,744 --> 00:15:16,294
In the Sherman's bag.

173
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:20,261
They're just trying to rattle you.

174
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:22,829
Sherman's?

175
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:25,589

176
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:28,218

177
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:31,509
Come on. Let me take you home.

00:15:37,006 --> 00:15:39,656
I got something I got to do.
I'll be okay.

179
00:15:40,312 --> 00:15:42,012
Want to give me the gun?

180
00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:44,864
Sure.

181
00:15:45,538 --> 00:15:47,028
I'll return it later.

182
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,917
He's stable. Get him to admitting.

183
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,336
- Sorry, man.
- You just get patched up.

184
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:04,924
We'll come by after the drop-off.

185
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:07,340
I'm gonna shove that bike
so far up your ass.

186
00:16:09,071 --> 00:16:10,771
He's gonna be just fine.

187
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:15,181
You tend to his every beck and call

188
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:18,613
and wipe his goddamn ass
if that's what he wants you to do.

189
00:16:18,738 --> 00:16:19,788
Call Piney.

190
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,689
Tell him we got two bikes down,
gonna need the flatbed.

191
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,941
That's you. Call Piney.

192
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:29,369
I got it.

193
00:16:29,494 --> 00:16:31,794
- I can take it.
- I said I got it.

194
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:39,550
What the hell you talking about,
you can't take him?

195
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:41,249
Mr. Trager has basic coverage.

196
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,793
He can only be admitted
to a hospital in his plan.

197
00:16:44,113 --> 00:16:46,004
He's bleeding in your hallway.

198
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,185
I'm sorry.
We'll have to transfer him to Red Bluff.

199
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,137
He's stable enough to travel.

200
00:16:50,262 --> 00:16:52,110
How about you give him
some pain meds?

201
00:16:52,235 --> 00:16:54,035
I can give him some advil.

202
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:57,672
He's got a gash the size
of your attitude on his leg.

203
00:16:57,797 --> 00:16:59,797
You got enough advil for that?

204
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:02,650
How much longer?

205
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:04,825
There's good news and bad news.

206
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:07,776
You're stable enough to travel.

207
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:10,111
What do you mean? Travel where?

208
00:17:10,427 --> 00:17:13,426
That's the bad news.
We got to move you to another hospital.

209
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:15,106
HMO bullshit!

210
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:16,707
Christ! Come on!

211
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:19,032
Stitch me up!

212
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:21,544
Sons of bitches!

213
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,085
Call Red Bluff. Need this guy shuttled.
Quicker the better.

214
00:17:30,812 --> 00:17:31,812
It's me.

215
00:17:32,263 --> 00:17:34,094
Run this name through your database:

216
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,753
Alexander Trager.

217
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:48,431
Chief.

218
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,111
We're not open for a few days,

219
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,026
but is there something
I can help you with?

220
00:17:56,151 --> 00:17:57,801
Not looking for smokes.

221
00:18:00,176 --> 00:18:01,726
I know who you are...

222
00:18:02,436 --> 00:18:03,456
What you do.

223
00:18:04,023 --> 00:18:06,751
If you're referring to the League
of American Nationalists, we're...

224
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,270
I'm not talking about
what you do with the suit and tie.

225
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:14,517
I'm talking about what you do
with the rubber masks.

226
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:17,199
I'm afraid you have me at a loss.

227
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:20,706
Things work themselves around.

228
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:23,939
Your time will come.

229
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,192
That sounds like a threat.

230
00:18:31,181 --> 00:18:32,981
Charming's a special town.

231
00:18:34,052 --> 00:18:35,852
Not many folks take to it.

232
00:18:38,176 --> 00:18:41,861
I like to think the town
chooses its occupants.

233
00:18:43,527 --> 00:18:44,827
Right ones stay.

234
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:48,835
Wrong ones disappear.

235
00:19:10,471 --> 00:19:11,691
I hate Kaiser.

236
00:19:12,545 --> 00:19:14,691
Shit. That bitch still
has your insurance card.

237
00:19:14,816 --> 00:19:15,816
I got it.

238
00:19:16,228 --> 00:19:18,364
Where the hell is
that deadbeat hospital?

239
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:19,273
Find out.

240
00:19:19,398 --> 00:19:22,735
- What do you want me to do, ask...?
- Find out. Ask whoever's in there.

241
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,836
Clay said your task
is to be my bitch.

242
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:28,814
- Yeah, he did.
- I got one request.

243
00:19:29,232 --> 00:19:33,071
You leave that piece of shit
fat boy on the side of the road.

244
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,999
- Dude, that is...
- Side of the road.

245
00:19:35,124 --> 00:19:38,174
- That is my baby. I...
- No. It almost killed me!

246
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:41,262
He doesn't know what a...

247
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,431
- Get up! Now!
- On your knees! Let's go!

248
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,475
- Jesus!
- Get off me! Goddamn it!

249
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:46,644
Tig? Shit!

250
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,440
Watch my leg...

251
00:19:50,035 --> 00:19:51,935
Don't worry. We'll find you.

252
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:53,859
Jesus!

253
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:55,611
Shit!

254
00:19:57,523 --> 00:19:58,673
Goddamn bike!

255
00:19:59,561 --> 00:20:00,811
And follow him!

256
00:20:06,222 --> 00:20:08,172
Where the hell were you guys?

257
00:20:09,328 --> 00:20:11,042
And you just let 'em...

258
00:20:12,274 --> 00:20:13,774
you just wait there.

259
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:16,612
You've done enough
goddamn damage today.

260
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:18,758
- What?
- Bounty hunters...

261
00:20:19,896 --> 00:20:21,835
- Just picked up Tig.
- The hell for?

262
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,429
They didn't stop to say.

263
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,266
- Half-Sack's trailing 'em.
- Jesus Christ.

264
00:20:26,571 --> 00:20:28,121
How does that happen?

265
00:20:28,552 --> 00:20:31,268
- Ask the jew in leather.
- It'll have been the hospital.

266
00:20:31,393 --> 00:20:34,283
Bounty hunters'll pay admins to call
in names and nefarious types.

267
00:20:34,408 --> 00:20:36,545
If Tig had an outstanding warrant,
I'd know about it.

268
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,844
Might be out of state.

269
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:40,448
If the bounty's big enough,
they could be hauling his ass to Maine.

270
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,011
- We got to go after him.
- We got a delivery to make.

271
00:20:43,136 --> 00:20:44,769
The bondsmen have no jurisdiction.

272
00:20:44,894 --> 00:20:46,665
There's nothing
to stop us taking him back.

273
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:50,039
What's stopping us is six bedrolls
full of illegal handguns.

274
00:20:51,114 --> 00:20:52,862
We go after him now,
we got a chance.

275
00:20:52,987 --> 00:20:55,109
- He crosses state lines...
- If Tig was here,

276
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:58,514
- he'd vote to deliver the guns.
- We dump the bedrolls somewhere safe.

277
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:00,882
Relay gets pushed by a few hours.

278
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:02,093
We're going.

279
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,887
Maybe we should call a vote.

280
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:05,304
You vote all you want.

281
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:06,973
I'm delivering the guns.

282
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:15,615
Goddamn it.

283
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:17,199
Shit.

284
00:21:19,531 --> 00:21:20,633
I got it.

285
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:35,241
- On three.
- Ready.

286
00:21:46,658 --> 00:21:49,758
Some days I can't even
get my dick out of my pants.

287
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:53,068
That's what prospects are for.

288
00:22:03,432 --> 00:22:04,632
You all right?

289
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,423
Family?

290
00:22:09,957 --> 00:22:10,957
I guess.

291
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:13,285
The road helps.

292
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:18,391
Reminds me why I signed up for all
this bullshit in the first place.

293
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:20,667
Amen, bro.

294
00:22:30,448 --> 00:22:33,244
We got to go get Tig.

295
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:37,138
This thing between you and Jax...

296
00:22:37,263 --> 00:22:41,241
I don't know what it is,
but it's pulling focus from what we are.

297
00:22:43,394 --> 00:22:45,333
I'm with you either way.

298
00:23:03,314 --> 00:23:04,314
He okay?

299
00:23:04,847 --> 00:23:07,447
He just needs to know
we've got his back.

300
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:14,624
Let's go get Tig.

301
00:23:27,112 --> 00:23:29,949
- I got your page.
- Chief Unser is looking for you.

302
00:23:30,682 --> 00:23:32,035
Is everything okay?

303
00:23:32,831 --> 00:23:36,186
You tell me.
You seem to get a lot of visitors.

304
00:23:36,454 --> 00:23:38,054
Both sides of the law.

305
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:47,467
Chief.

306
00:23:49,051 --> 00:23:51,751
Didn't mean to pull you
away from anything.

307
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:54,309
What is it?

308
00:23:56,808 --> 00:23:58,158
Something happen?

309
00:23:59,311 --> 00:24:01,348
She's out of sorts.

310
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:04,409
Matter of time
before she hurts someone.

311
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:05,778
Herself.

312
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:09,269
Not sure how to help her.

313
00:24:09,394 --> 00:24:12,344
She has to talk to somebody
about what happened.

314
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,061
I tried.

315
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,909
You care about her.

316
00:24:24,592 --> 00:24:26,809
Known her since she was 12.

317
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:33,062
Me and Emily Koza's the ones that tried
to talk her out of running away.

318
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:37,404
She split when she was 16.

319
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:41,612
Came back ten years later
with a baby and a motorcycle club.

320
00:24:43,193 --> 00:24:46,493
Sort of like you did,
except without the baby and such.

321
00:24:51,603 --> 00:24:53,934
You and Jax seem to be doing okay.

322
00:24:56,164 --> 00:24:58,164
We're trying to figure it out.

323
00:25:00,762 --> 00:25:01,962
What do you...

324
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,490
make of us?

325
00:25:06,035 --> 00:25:07,035
The doctor

326
00:25:07,872 --> 00:25:09,090
and the biker?

327
00:25:11,015 --> 00:25:12,915
I've seen stranger pairings.

328
00:25:14,077 --> 00:25:15,077
Excuse me.

329
00:25:15,202 --> 00:25:16,950
Cardiorespiratory tech
is looking for you.

330
00:25:17,075 --> 00:25:18,075
Thank you.

331
00:25:23,745 --> 00:25:25,899
Don't think on it too hard, doc.

332
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,609
Come across something
don't make you miserable...

333
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:32,947
Enjoy it.

334
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:30,840
No one's going to tell me
why I got scooped up?

335
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:31,965
Nothing?

336
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:35,413
No small talk?

337
00:26:35,858 --> 00:26:39,808
No "hundred bottles of beer
on the wall," "row, row, row your boat"?

338
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:47,159
I'll start.

339
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:51,329
I'm guessing you played
college ball there, baldy.

340
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:53,092
Offensive line.

341
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:56,355
Too much of a pussy to make
the pro and too stupid to graduate.

342
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,931
Shut your mouth, asshole.

343
00:26:58,056 --> 00:27:00,629
You are clearly in it because
of your aggression issues.

344
00:27:00,754 --> 00:27:03,840
- You heard what he said?
- And you're at least half a fag.

345
00:27:03,965 --> 00:27:05,441
You're probably in love with him,

346
00:27:05,566 --> 00:27:08,475
and this job...
it's your way of staying close.

347
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,028
Knock it off.

348
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:13,464
We don't collect
if we bring him in beaten.

349
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:15,391
It's Oregon.

350
00:27:16,242 --> 00:27:17,244
Oregon?

351
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,665
I've got nothing
outstanding in Oregon.

352
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,790
2001.

353
00:27:21,317 --> 00:27:24,817
Assault and indecent exposure
inside a livestock transport.

354
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:26,478
Shit.

355
00:27:27,418 --> 00:27:29,318
I thought that got squashed.

356
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:32,131
You skipped on a $40,000 bond.

357
00:27:33,545 --> 00:27:34,695
Sick bastard.

358
00:27:38,442 --> 00:27:40,692
You're dying to ask me, aren't you?

359
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:41,925
Go ahead.

360
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:46,054
- Bet you got half a stiffy, Oprah.
- Gag him.

361
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,270
Jesus christ, break it up!

362
00:27:58,762 --> 00:27:59,992
You son of a bitch!

363
00:28:00,117 --> 00:28:02,252
- Get him out of here now.
- Get off of me!

364
00:28:02,377 --> 00:28:03,677
Get out of here.

365
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,421
What are you hitting me for?

366
00:28:15,546 --> 00:28:17,069
I was cooperating.

367
00:28:17,823 --> 00:28:18,823
Shit.

368
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:34,474
Where are the bounty hunters?

369
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:37,882
They got Tig maybe two miles
down the road at a hotel.

370
00:28:38,998 --> 00:28:40,398
You talk to Gemma?

371
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:45,445
I tried to get a hold of her and let her
know I was coming up here, but nothing.

372
00:28:46,438 --> 00:28:48,684
- Where the hell is she?
- I don't know.

373
00:28:49,184 --> 00:28:52,188
Your old lady doesn't take kindly
to people prying into her shit.

374
00:28:54,414 --> 00:28:56,914
I had Dog and Clayton
lock the place up

375
00:28:57,221 --> 00:28:59,171
in case she doesn't get back.

376
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,471
All right.

377
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,270
Thanks, old man.

378
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,670
Sure.

379
00:29:12,498 --> 00:29:15,951
They got Tig in a motel about
two miles down the road. Four of 'em.

380
00:29:16,076 --> 00:29:17,838
Sporting heavy hardware.

381
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:20,908
- First floor, room 12.
- Why did they stop at a motel?

382
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:23,452
Don't know. They beat the shit out
of Tig on the side of the road.

383
00:29:23,577 --> 00:29:24,935
The motel was the next stop.

384
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,091
That crazy prick
must have provoked 'em.

385
00:29:27,216 --> 00:29:30,009
- Can't bring him in beat up to a pulp.
- So they're patching him up.

386
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:33,094
- All right, let's go handle this.
- If they hit a motel,

387
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:35,856
they got a long ride ahead of 'em.
They're going to be there for a while.

388
00:29:36,202 --> 00:29:39,636
Call up the run, tell the boys
from Tacoma to get back down here.

389
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:42,829
That's going to take hours.
We got to do this now.

390
00:29:42,954 --> 00:29:43,835
He's right.

391
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,742
- We don't know how long they're...
- What, in broad daylight?

392
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:48,933
This is the way
we stay off the radar, right?

393
00:29:49,058 --> 00:29:51,188
We're going to be doing
runs up here every two weeks

394
00:29:51,313 --> 00:29:52,620
with a blanket full of guns.

395
00:29:52,745 --> 00:29:56,737
And bringing five more guys into the mix
is going to make it low-profile?

396
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:59,255
We wait until dark.
Somebody goes out for food...

397
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,055
We don't know that{\ if they're going
to be here after dark.}.

398
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,633
- We got eight on four.
- You heard Bobby.

399
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:06,279
They're armed to the teeth.
We have no idea what kind of firepower

400
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:09,556
- they're sitting on. We got handguns.
- We got surprise.

401
00:30:09,681 --> 00:30:11,642
- Call the guys.
- Call a vote.

402
00:30:12,007 --> 00:30:13,310
You don't call a vote.

403
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,438
You don't lay
your goddamn hands on me!

404
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:16,689
You two, come on!

405
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,642
Everybody's fried,

406
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:21,845
and it's my fault.
I got Tig hurt.

407
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:24,348
Stupid shit.

408
00:30:24,592 --> 00:30:27,105
But everybody has got to calm down.

409
00:30:31,687 --> 00:30:32,865
Have a smoke.

410
00:30:33,144 --> 00:30:34,588
Take a walk.

411
00:30:34,943 --> 00:30:37,274
Everybody, clear your head.

412
00:30:42,021 --> 00:30:43,241
Where you going?

413
00:30:43,366 --> 00:30:45,634
You want to get this done,
jump on the back.

414
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:50,061
This is bad.

415
00:30:50,346 --> 00:30:52,126
I have a feeling
it's about to get worse.

416
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:53,511
Chibs, sack, come on.

417
00:30:53,636 --> 00:30:55,120
- What's up?
- Shit-kicking.

418
00:30:55,245 --> 00:30:56,245
I'm in.

419
00:31:01,785 --> 00:31:03,444
Where the hell are you going?!

420
00:31:04,332 --> 00:31:05,332
Shit!

421
00:31:07,195 --> 00:31:08,648
Got worse quick.

422
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,921
We have a plan here?

423
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,389
Ask the old man.

424
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:26,384
All right, hang on, guys!

425
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:33,689
It's a simple plan.

426
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,480
Shit!

427
00:31:35,753 --> 00:31:37,003
Arm up, ladies.

428
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:56,705
Don't move!

429
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:59,007
Or we'll blow your balls off!

430
00:32:00,892 --> 00:32:02,792
Listen, I got to tell you...

431
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,710
It's been a lot of fun.
Really got to go. This is my ride.

432
00:32:06,835 --> 00:32:08,833
I'd really like to thank you
for everything.

433
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:11,387
I hope we can do it again sometime.

434
00:32:11,854 --> 00:32:12,680
Go!

435
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:13,947
Hello?

436
00:33:15,075 --> 00:33:16,238
Hey, buddy.

437
00:33:17,178 --> 00:33:19,788
Good.
How was practice?

438
00:33:21,608 --> 00:33:23,083
That's awesome, Cliffy.

439
00:33:23,859 --> 00:33:26,559
I told you.
I told you shit happens, right?

440
00:33:28,476 --> 00:33:29,715
Absolutely.

441
00:33:30,595 --> 00:33:31,595
Should be.

442
00:33:33,603 --> 00:33:35,638
You help your brother with that.

443
00:33:38,837 --> 00:33:40,777
Cliffy, just get it done.

444
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:42,558
All right, buddy.

445
00:33:43,648 --> 00:33:44,848
See you later.

446
00:34:11,027 --> 00:34:12,841
You think I got a death wish?

447
00:34:14,796 --> 00:34:17,196
Sounds like
some crazy shit, brother.

448
00:34:19,294 --> 00:34:20,432
No comment?

449
00:34:20,988 --> 00:34:23,221
Just a little cautious, I guess.

450
00:34:23,512 --> 00:34:26,105
Not sure what I say
ain't going to land in Clay's ear.

451
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,949
- What the hell does that mean?
- You tell me, bro.

452
00:34:30,074 --> 00:34:33,445
Don't drag me into whatever bullshit
you got going on with stepdaddy.

453
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:48,643
I know you're pissed,
but the guys were right this time.

454
00:34:48,824 --> 00:34:51,016
That motel was a quick stop.
I would have been in Oregon

455
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:54,216
- by the end of the day.
- Get him to Saint Thomas.

456
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:56,378
Hopefully, that's in your plan.

457
00:34:56,503 --> 00:34:58,996
This isn't on Jax.
It was my idea.

458
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,820
Just have to blame it on the,

459
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,391
dementia.

460
00:35:06,987 --> 00:35:07,967
Shit.

461
00:35:08,092 --> 00:35:10,413
Going to be a long ride, Tig.

462
00:35:11,455 --> 00:35:12,609
Got another straw?

463
00:35:14,325 --> 00:35:15,475
There you go.

464
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:48,821
Guys are one short.

465
00:35:48,953 --> 00:35:51,106
Yeah, we laid a bike down
outside of Chico.

466
00:35:51,494 --> 00:35:53,045
We got all the cargo, though.

467
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,819
I figured it'd be Tig.

468
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,044
Is he whole?

469
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,910
We're perfect.

470
00:35:59,749 --> 00:36:01,649
All right, guys, pack it up.

471
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,390
Right.

472
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:53,309
You do know the serial number
has been ground off that.

473
00:36:54,988 --> 00:36:56,698
Anonymity suits me.

474
00:36:58,804 --> 00:37:01,454
Prefer it didn't end up
in your bag again.

475
00:37:04,035 --> 00:37:06,185
Not sure I can make that promise.

476
00:37:12,032 --> 00:37:14,857
I got no idea how to help you.

477
00:37:16,794 --> 00:37:18,932
All I can do is my job.

478
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,353
I ain't going to let nothing else
bad happen to you.

479
00:37:36,562 --> 00:37:37,612
Good night.

480
00:38:20,662 --> 00:38:22,049
Easy there, darling.

481
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,118
That one's got a glass ball.

482
00:38:25,932 --> 00:38:27,883
It's actually a crystal ball.

483
00:38:28,174 --> 00:38:30,350
Allows me to see
the future of my penis.

484
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,392
How is that working out for you?

485
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,980
It's looking pretty good.

486
00:38:44,607 --> 00:38:46,531
You roll a shitty-ass joint.

487
00:38:48,406 --> 00:38:49,868
A masterpiece.

488
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:08,818
We get back, going to lock
Jax and Clay in a room.

489
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:13,857
- Got to work this shit out.
- It's more than that.

490
00:39:13,982 --> 00:39:16,171
Jax has got to get over
his dead daddy shit.

491
00:39:16,296 --> 00:39:17,073
Bollocks.

492
00:39:17,198 --> 00:39:19,441
Clay can't deal with
the fact he's getting older

493
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:21,525
and the kid's pushing him out.

494
00:39:22,178 --> 00:39:24,194
Clay's not going anywhere.

495
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,796
I didn't know what the old man
was up to till we were crashing through.

496
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:12,021
I don't give a shit about today.

497
00:40:13,658 --> 00:40:15,558
Where does this go tomorrow?

498
00:40:17,428 --> 00:40:18,428
Next week?

499
00:40:20,189 --> 00:40:21,639
Where does what go?

500
00:40:21,973 --> 00:40:24,882
Your need to undermine
my every goddamn play.

501
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,674
I got no need to undermine you.

502
00:40:28,252 --> 00:40:30,877
The things I call out
are about the club.

503
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,719
About you and me.

504
00:40:39,007 --> 00:40:40,432
Maybe they are.

505
00:40:41,956 --> 00:40:44,149
Guess I got to get right with you.

506
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,467
What you did.

507
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:50,290
You do.

508
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:54,022
You got decades of experience.

509
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,980
Why don't you tell me how I do that?

510
00:40:57,328 --> 00:41:01,332
How I get right with you trying to kill
a brother behind the club's back.

511
00:41:02,091 --> 00:41:05,691
Your little trigger boy blowing
an innocent woman's head off.

512
00:41:11,884 --> 00:41:14,800
You're going to have to figure
that out for yourself, son.

513
00:41:14,925 --> 00:41:15,925
But...

514
00:41:17,193 --> 00:41:18,683
I'd do it soon.

515
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:25,108
'cause if you mention Donna
or the incident again...

516
00:41:28,497 --> 00:41:29,697
I'll kill you.

517
00:41:39,016 --> 00:41:43,020
