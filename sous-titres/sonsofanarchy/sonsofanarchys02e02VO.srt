<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:03,576 --> 00:00:05,630
Just here to give you
a little friendly advice.

3
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:07,754
We feel it would be best
for all concerned

4
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:10,968
if you stopped dealing arms
to the One-Niners and the Mayans.

5
00:00:11,137 --> 00:00:14,263
- You're done selling guns to color.
- Nobody threatens Sam Crow.

6
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:16,745
Black, brown or white.

7
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:19,477
Opie has turned on us.

8
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:21,046
His death never...

9
00:00:21,998 --> 00:00:24,231
- lands at our feet.
- Love you.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,399
Love you back.

11
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,860
- What, a drive-by?
- Make it ghetto. Make it gangster.

12
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,740
- Shit!
- Clay tried to kill my son.

13
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,450
Slaughtered his wife by mistake.

14
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:37,169
I'm depending on you
to make that right.

15
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:42,416
- That's so Alvarez knows who and why.
- I'll dump the body.

16
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:51,217
- Where are you on this? Me and Jax?
- You really want my advice?

17
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,077
- Total disclosure.
- I'm gonna stay,

18
00:00:53,202 --> 00:00:55,638
I need to know the truth, not just
what you think I can handle.

19
00:00:55,817 --> 00:00:57,167
I need all of it.

20
00:00:57,444 --> 00:00:58,974
I helped Opie kill a man today.

21
00:00:59,468 --> 00:01:00,935
Retaliation for Donna.

22
00:01:01,248 --> 00:01:02,049
Please.

23
00:01:02,174 --> 00:01:05,624
My baby swallowed something.
He's choking. Please help me.

24
00:01:09,624 --> 00:01:12,196
We need you to pass
on the message to your old man.

25
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:14,782
Tell him to stop selling guns
to niggers and wetbacks,

26
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:17,351
or we find you,
and we do this again.

27
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:51,459
Gemma?

28
00:02:53,147 --> 00:02:54,497
Anybody in there?

29
00:02:58,383 --> 00:03:00,514
Wayne!

30
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:19,267
Oh, my god.

31
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,710
Get me out of here.

32
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:39,839
How'd you know I was there?

33
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:43,623
I heard it over the radio.

34
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:46,100
Recognized
the description of the car.

35
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:49,834
Anonymous tip?

36
00:03:57,517 --> 00:04:00,117
You got to tell me something here,
Gemma.

37
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:08,044
Where are you going?

38
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:09,389
St. Thomas.

39
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:14,211
Got to get you to the hospital.

40
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,479
No hospital.

41
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,514
What am I supposed to do here,
Gemma?

42
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:33,787
Give me your cell.

43
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,361
Tara, it's you.

44
00:04:53,598 --> 00:04:54,585
Hello?

45
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:05,268
Jax see you leave?

46
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:07,806
I told him it was the hospital.

47
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,394
You need to tell me what happened
so I can help you.

48
00:05:15,286 --> 00:05:16,836
Use your imagination.

49
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:23,513
- Maybe we should let her rest a while.
- We have to get her to the hospital.

50
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:30,206
- I can't treat you in my living room.
- Look, I'd have to check in.

51
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:32,103
The insurance and shit.

52
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:34,741
Everybody'll know.

53
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:43,058
We'll go home,

54
00:05:44,536 --> 00:05:46,486
get you some clothes, then...

55
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,725
Then pick up Abel.
We'll sign him in.

56
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,767
We'll say we're running more tests.

57
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:56,551
You could get fired for that.

58
00:05:57,568 --> 00:05:59,018
I'll figure it out.

59
00:06:01,637 --> 00:06:02,787
Promise me...

60
00:06:04,293 --> 00:06:05,893
You won't tell anyone.

61
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:08,811
Promise.

62
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:11,741
- We got to tell Clay.
- Not Clay.

63
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:14,253
Not Jax.

64
00:06:15,406 --> 00:06:16,406
No one.

65
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:23,128
All right.

66
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:29,558
I won't say anything.

67
00:06:36,558 --> 00:06:38,408
They're gonna see her face.

68
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,350
I know.

69
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:44,365
Stay with her, all right?

70
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:51,978
What?

71
00:07:58,481 --> 00:07:59,681
Just a minute.

72
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:05,776
I love you.

73
00:08:06,537 --> 00:08:07,537
I do.

74
00:08:14,523 --> 00:08:15,603
Clay?

75
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:22,721
Get out!

76
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,430
Come on, it's Alvarez on the prepay.

77
00:08:36,424 --> 00:08:38,725
Niners came into my hood
and took out one of my guys.

78
00:08:42,132 --> 00:08:44,332
How do you know it was the Niners?

79
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:46,387
Niggers blew out his guts,

80
00:08:46,512 --> 00:08:48,612
got him holding up nine fingers.

81
00:08:49,102 --> 00:08:51,019
Shit's going sideways out here, man.

82
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:53,657
Gonna need those AKs.
As many as you got.

83
00:08:55,388 --> 00:08:56,668
I'm sorry, man.

84
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:59,189
I want to help you out,

85
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:01,999
but this ATF thing's got us tapped.

86
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:07,004
You better be telling me
some straight shit, <i>ese</i>.

87
00:09:07,739 --> 00:09:09,939
I'm as straight as shit gets, man.

88
00:09:10,726 --> 00:09:11,726
Sorry.

89
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:20,157
Thought you said Opie
tagged that Mayan SOA?

90
00:09:20,282 --> 00:09:23,164
- He did. He carved it on his belly.
- Well, Alvarez just found the guy,

91
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:25,689
his guts blown out,
holding up a nine.

92
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:29,735
Had to be Jax.

93
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:34,255
All right.

94
00:09:35,349 --> 00:09:36,399
Call Laroy.

95
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:39,267
Tell him it's about to jump off.

96
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,747
He's gonna need some guns.

97
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:26,407

I'll send somebody out.

111
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:12,042
Rosen.

112
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:14,292
Otto wants to talk to us.

113
00:11:14,594 --> 00:11:15,942
Here comes Captain Black.

114
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,467
Premium or regular, sir?

115
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,629
Your intel checked out.

116
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,129
Dead Mayan was flashing our sign.

117
00:11:31,849 --> 00:11:34,276
Had to be the Mexicans
killed their own guy.

118
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,619
Guess you and me,

119
00:11:36,744 --> 00:11:39,419
- we're going steady again.
- I'm happy to say

120
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:41,732
that our little Mexican
retail experiment...

121
00:11:41,857 --> 00:11:43,607
in the rearview, brother.

122
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,791
You look tired, man.

123
00:11:53,308 --> 00:11:55,172
Recreational H is drying up.

124
00:11:55,688 --> 00:11:59,188
Ain't no stimulus package
for the middle-class powder user.

125
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:01,678
Black and brown
back to fighting over the junkie trade.

126
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:05,541
- Recession sucks.
- Going to need two dozen AKs.

127
00:12:06,776 --> 00:12:07,776
All right.

128
00:12:08,163 --> 00:12:10,937
They'll be simple, though.
No scopes, no mods.

129
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:15,719
- Need them tonight.
- I'll call you with the location.

130
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:24,176
Something you fellows need?

131
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:27,245
Black man can't stop
for gas in Charming?

132
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,539
As long as he buys enough
to get him back to the hood.

133
00:12:35,946 --> 00:12:37,496
Boys have a nice day.

134
00:12:43,918 --> 00:12:46,723
- Thought we don't shit where we eat.
- Relax.

135
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:48,715
Just mending some fences.

136
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:51,857
What?

137
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,791
There's a car out by the power
and water construction site.

138
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:59,244
- Needs a tow.
- Call the garage.

139
00:13:00,241 --> 00:13:01,691
It's Gemma's caddy.

140
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:05,283
She ran off the road last night
heading home from Jax's.

141
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,651
She all right?

142
00:13:08,552 --> 00:13:10,480
She's with Tara at St. Thomas.

143
00:13:10,605 --> 00:13:13,469
- You tell me this shit now, right?
- Just found out.

144
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:14,918
I came looking for you.

145
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:27,605
Shit.

146
00:13:28,235 --> 00:13:29,735
Neeta started today.

147
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,007
Good morning.

148
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,270
Morning.

149
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,054
My god. What happened?

150
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:05,108
I'm fine.

151
00:14:06,635 --> 00:14:08,735
I need to get him to St. Thomas.

152
00:14:09,138 --> 00:14:10,138
Why?

153
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:13,334
I'll have him back before lunch.

154
00:14:14,234 --> 00:14:16,434
Thought he just had all his tests.

155
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,120
He needs more.

156
00:14:19,502 --> 00:14:20,775
Is something wrong?

157
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:24,378
I'm Dr. Knowles.

158
00:14:25,294 --> 00:14:26,544
I'm his doctor.

159
00:14:33,312 --> 00:14:35,093
Want to tell me
what's going on here?

160
00:14:35,218 --> 00:14:37,918
I need to get
both of them to the hospital.

161
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:43,590
Maybe I should follow you.

162
00:14:44,106 --> 00:14:45,556
That would be good.

163
00:14:48,841 --> 00:14:51,122
Step aside, step aside.
Man down, man down.

164
00:14:51,247 --> 00:14:52,497
Out of the way.

165
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:00,381
- How's the homecoming queen?
- He's a little green.

166
00:15:00,506 --> 00:15:01,399
How's Gemma?

167
00:15:02,024 --> 00:15:03,276
Better than you.

168
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,487
Good, good. Alright, alright.

169
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:14,888
There's a number of small tears.

170
00:15:15,013 --> 00:15:17,563
It's nothing
that won't heal on its own.

171
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:25,006
We'll start you
on antibiotics right away.

172
00:15:27,046 --> 00:15:30,084
It's standard procedure to treat
for chlamydia and gonorrhea,

173
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:31,972
even before the test results
are back.

174
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:49,861
You should have a plastic surgeon
look at this.

175
00:15:51,361 --> 00:15:52,911
I've been hit before.

176
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:05,984
Sorry to interrupt, doc.

177
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:07,859
I need a word with Gemma.

178
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:10,845
Let him in.

179
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:15,403
Sorry.

180
00:16:16,963 --> 00:16:18,013
What is it?

181
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:20,237
Clay is here.

182
00:16:21,386 --> 00:16:22,849
You son of a bitch.

183
00:16:22,974 --> 00:16:25,424
I told him you were
in a car accident.

184
00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:26,949
What?

185
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:30,808
Ran your caddy into a concrete barrier
out by the utility shed.

186
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,505
Take my head off if you want.

187
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,480
I just didn't seen
any other way to sell this.

188
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,210
He don't know about nothing else.

189
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:46,935
I'll go and talk to him.

190
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:52,891
I don't want to see him yet.

191
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:54,816
Actually,

192
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:57,583
they're all here.

193
00:16:58,325 --> 00:17:01,021
- Jax and the guys.
- Jesus Christ.

194
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,813
Is there anyone you didn't tell?

195
00:17:04,474 --> 00:17:05,724
I'll handle it.

196
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,070
Maybe I should help her.

197
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,121
This wasn't about me.

198
00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:22,362
What do you mean?

199
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:25,151
What those animals did

200
00:17:26,927 --> 00:17:28,277
was to hurt Clay,

201
00:17:28,993 --> 00:17:29,993
Jax.

202
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:34,992
Anyone finds out...

203
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:38,657
They win.

204
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,241
I can't let that happen.

205
00:17:46,342 --> 00:17:47,842
Who's "they," honey?

206
00:17:53,064 --> 00:17:54,464
That don't matter.

207
00:18:11,963 --> 00:18:13,013
How is she?

208
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:16,309
She's fine.

209
00:18:16,969 --> 00:18:18,419
Just a few bruises.

210
00:18:19,844 --> 00:18:20,894
Okay, good.

211
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:24,385
And you?

212
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,641
Look, I'm glad you asked
for the truth.

213
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:35,363
It means a lot to me you want
to figure out how to make this work.

214
00:18:44,947 --> 00:18:46,647
I have to let Clay know.

215
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,719
What's going on? Is she okay?

216
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:02,137
When she hit the barrier,
she took a pretty good shot to the face.

217
00:19:02,262 --> 00:19:03,862
There's some swelling.

218
00:19:04,356 --> 00:19:07,103
I have to run a few more tests,
but she's going to be fine.

219
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,233
But, uh, it's nothing serious?

220
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:17,678
- Can I see her?
- It's gonna be a little while.

221
00:19:20,885 --> 00:19:22,948
I appreciate
you taking care of her, doc.

222
00:19:23,073 --> 00:19:24,073
Of course.

223
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:33,797
Something wrong?

224
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,449
They found that Mayan we visited.

225
00:19:37,574 --> 00:19:39,674
He was throwing up nine fingers.

226
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:42,222
Brown's a little pissed at black.

227
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:46,351
I made a decision...
for the good of the club.

228
00:19:47,297 --> 00:19:49,270
You settle that shit on your own?

229
00:19:51,885 --> 00:19:54,835
Spur of the moment,
seemed like the right thing.

230
00:19:55,053 --> 00:19:56,953
I'm sure you can understand.

231
00:19:59,358 --> 00:20:01,032
Feds raided Luann's studio.

232
00:20:01,764 --> 00:20:02,964
Asset seizure.

233
00:20:04,515 --> 00:20:05,715
Wiped her out.

234
00:20:07,948 --> 00:20:11,348
- Me and Ope will go deal with Otto.
- Ope goes with Tig.

235
00:20:13,075 --> 00:20:15,475
Take Bobby.
He can use the fresh air.

236
00:20:19,949 --> 00:20:21,199
I'll handle it.

237
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:41,933
- Arranged a little entertainment.
- Appreciate that.

238
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:43,867
White on white?

239
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,368
What's that about?

240
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,735
Our Aryan friends
are getting a little choosy

241
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,010
about who they burn crosses with.

242
00:20:50,135 --> 00:20:53,235
Something's trickling down
from the top of mount whitey.

243
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,560
Not sure what.

244
00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:58,181
Not why I asked to see you.

245
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:00,906
I know.
I heard about Luann.

246
00:21:01,967 --> 00:21:03,072
How can we help?

247
00:21:03,197 --> 00:21:05,814
This punk producer's making
a play for her talent.

248
00:21:05,939 --> 00:21:08,725
Feds shutting her down,
this asshole will hijack all of them.

249
00:21:09,177 --> 00:21:10,577
We'll talk to him.

250
00:21:12,696 --> 00:21:16,346
She needs time and money to get
up and running in a new space.

251
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:20,820
We can get her the time.

252
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:22,825
And the money?

253
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:27,266
We're only half healed, Otto.

254
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,350
We don't have it.

255
00:21:34,065 --> 00:21:35,992
This seizure by the feds,

256
00:21:37,658 --> 00:21:40,252
it's Stahl pissing in my mouth
for what I did to her.

257
00:21:40,377 --> 00:21:42,277
And I did that for Sam Crow.

258
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:44,801
I know that.

259
00:21:51,141 --> 00:21:54,191
I don't want her back
in front of the camera, Jax.

260
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,900
I told her she'd never have
to do that again.

261
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:02,242
I won't let that happen.

262
00:22:03,932 --> 00:22:05,073
That's a promise.

263
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:31,466
Dump those in the back.

264
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:40,858
She didn't tell him.

265
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,527
Morrow's old lady.

266
00:22:43,939 --> 00:22:46,377
- They don't know what happened.
- How do you know?

267
00:22:46,502 --> 00:22:49,033
The nigger nanny said Gemma
got hurt in a car accident.

268
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:52,120
Clay's laughing,
playing with some little kid.

269
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,248
- You said this was gonna rip them up.
- It will.

270
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,753
Unraveling the matriarch
will destabilize them.

271
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,528
They're all little boys

272
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:03,439
who need a strong mommy.

273
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,752
But if this bitch
doesn't say anything,

274
00:23:05,877 --> 00:23:07,827
what the hell does that mean?

275
00:23:08,497 --> 00:23:12,427
It means
we underestimated Mrs. Morrow.

276
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:24,712
Baby.

277
00:23:27,237 --> 00:23:28,387
I'm so sorry.

278
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:32,579
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, it's okay.

279
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:34,996
I'm just... I'm just kind of jumpy.

280
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,528
Now, you got to lay off
them midnight joyrides.

281
00:23:46,069 --> 00:23:47,069
You okay?

282
00:23:49,246 --> 00:23:50,246
I'm fine.

283
00:23:54,277 --> 00:23:55,631
It's kind of hot.

284
00:23:57,517 --> 00:23:58,517
Thanks.

285
00:23:59,275 --> 00:24:01,939
That's what I was going for.

286
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,083
Are you ready to go home?

287
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:08,594
You know, they have to...
They got to do some more x-rays.

288
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:10,531
Neeta can give me a lift.

289
00:24:11,527 --> 00:24:12,601
I can wait.

290
00:24:12,726 --> 00:24:14,077
No, honey.
It's okay.

291
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,483
Yeah, it's gonna be a while.

292
00:24:16,608 --> 00:24:18,421
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

293
00:24:18,546 --> 00:24:19,696
I'm really...

294
00:24:20,316 --> 00:24:21,316
I'm fine.

295
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:24,199
Okay.

296
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,319
I love you.

297
00:24:33,613 --> 00:24:35,014
I love you too.

298
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,205
I got to add
these two cameras to the list.

299
00:24:59,821 --> 00:25:01,671
Here's half your retainers.

300
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,085
I'll give you the other
half at the end of the week.

301
00:25:04,592 --> 00:25:06,838
You stay away from Georgie, hear me?

302
00:25:07,185 --> 00:25:10,716
All his actors end up
strung out and turning tricks.

303
00:25:14,377 --> 00:25:15,377
We will.

304
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:20,761
Marvelous.

305
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:24,525
My god,
they did clean you out of the way.***

306
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:26,601
Otto wasn't kidding.

307
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,532
That's some lovely merchandise
walking out that door.

308
00:25:29,657 --> 00:25:32,363
And they'll keep walking if I don't
come up with the rest of their money.

309
00:25:32,844 --> 00:25:34,972
Otto said some guy's
giving you trouble?

310
00:25:35,097 --> 00:25:36,347
Georgie Caruso.

311
00:25:36,715 --> 00:25:40,204
Shitbag's threatening my girls,
they don't join his company.

312
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,792
His name is georgie?

313
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:44,900
Can't you just talk to him, make
some kind of temporary arrangement?

314
00:25:45,025 --> 00:25:46,704
Isn't how it works with this.

315
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:48,245
Georgie's game is fear.

316
00:25:48,518 --> 00:25:51,883
Goddam roy crew runs his girls
like pimp's running pussy

317
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:56,349
If I could just get the money
I loaned sam crow...

318
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:58,624
That's not going to happen today.

319
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:03,420
I said to Otto I'd back this guy off
of you, and that's what I'm gonna do.

320
00:26:04,478 --> 00:26:06,278
Where's this guy's office?

321
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:13,964
I love that movie.

322
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:16,130
I laughed, I cried, I came.

323
00:26:16,255 --> 00:26:19,614
Holy shit, it must have been good.
It won an anal oscar.

324
00:26:21,466 --> 00:26:22,516
Here we go.

325
00:26:25,358 --> 00:26:28,336
- You need something?
- We're here to see Georgie.

326
00:26:29,766 --> 00:26:31,416
You got an appointment?

327
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:33,966
Then you don't see him.

328
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:36,761
Auditions are out back.

329
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:40,907
Let me guess... Georgie Caruso.

330
00:26:41,378 --> 00:26:43,559
They were just leaving, mr. Caruso.

331
00:26:44,171 --> 00:26:45,569
That's too bad, 'cause

332
00:26:45,694 --> 00:26:48,844
this one here's got kind
of a Brad Pitt thing going.

333
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,902
Only not quite as gay.

334
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:54,555
I'm a friend of Luann Delaney.

335
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,247
Is that so?

336
00:26:56,888 --> 00:26:59,033
I'm real sorry about what happened.

337
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,201
You're terrorizing her actors.

338
00:27:01,642 --> 00:27:03,273
That stops now.

339
00:27:05,577 --> 00:27:06,791
I'm helping those girls.

340
00:27:08,181 --> 00:27:10,086
Luann is out of business.

341
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:12,296
Luann's not out of business.

342
00:27:13,837 --> 00:27:15,537
That's not what I heard.

343
00:27:16,512 --> 00:27:18,462
Don't make me come back here.

344
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:24,734
Bye, Georgie.

345
00:27:31,122 --> 00:27:32,817
You got a problem?

346
00:27:44,783 --> 00:27:47,383
Not now, man.
I feel pretty good. Thanks.

347
00:27:47,545 --> 00:27:48,833
I told you I was sick.

348
00:27:51,244 --> 00:27:52,586
Need six more.

349
00:28:04,663 --> 00:28:05,725
You doing okay?

350
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,340
I mean, family and stuff.

351
00:28:11,517 --> 00:28:12,695
I guess.

352
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,560
I lost an old lady.

353
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,018
Yeah, I dumped an fxr on the I-5

354
00:28:21,143 --> 00:28:24,643
and the poor bitch slid right
in front of oncoming traffic.

355
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,980
Shit, I didn't know that.

356
00:28:28,783 --> 00:28:31,935
- Your kid's mom?
- I wish it was that gash.

357
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:36,200
No, it was before I got patched.
Found out she was pregnant.

358
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:38,192
Really loved that one.

359
00:28:42,005 --> 00:28:43,535
I keep dreaming.

360
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:46,799
I'm back in Chino.

361
00:28:48,806 --> 00:28:50,701
Really violent shit.

362
00:28:51,739 --> 00:28:53,625
Then I wake up relieved,

363
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:55,581
that I'm home.

364
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,670
It takes me a minute
to realize that I'm alone in bed.

365
00:29:05,784 --> 00:29:07,384
You're not alone, Ope.

366
00:29:11,256 --> 00:29:12,693
I appreciate it.

367
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:26,309
Shit.

368
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:28,140
What?

369
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,160
That's just someone
I don't want to see.

370
00:29:32,493 --> 00:29:34,628
She's gonna have
a million questions.

371
00:29:34,753 --> 00:29:36,253
We can wait in here.

372
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,449
I'm not gonna do it today,

373
00:29:50,737 --> 00:29:52,787
'cause I ain't a stupid sister,

374
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,267
but you know at some point,

375
00:29:55,392 --> 00:29:57,537
I'm gonna have some questions.

376
00:29:59,991 --> 00:30:00,991
I know.

377
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,610
While we're here,
you want to say a prayer with me?

378
00:30:07,783 --> 00:30:09,390
I'm not big on praying.

379
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:12,843
Sure you are.

380
00:30:13,486 --> 00:30:15,479
Look at the way you're holding him.

381
00:30:16,192 --> 00:30:18,037
I can see it in your face...

382
00:30:18,162 --> 00:30:19,972
you're thanking god.

383
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,143
It's gonna be okay.
Just tip your head back a little bit.

384
00:30:27,268 --> 00:30:30,494
I don't think it's broken, so...
Wait a minute, hang on to that.

385
00:30:31,092 --> 00:30:35,042
I told you not to stir things up.
Look what that asshole did to her.

386
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:38,969
- This was Caruso?
- Who do you think?

387
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:40,796
Little prick.

388
00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:44,840
You guys must have really
put the fear of god into him.

389
00:30:44,965 --> 00:30:46,635
Tell them what Georgie said.

390
00:30:48,212 --> 00:30:52,216
He told me to tell Luann that
if the little biker boys show up again,

391
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,926
he's going to roll the cameras

392
00:30:55,051 --> 00:30:57,438
while he jams
his dick up all your asses.

393
00:30:58,514 --> 00:31:00,450
We'll see Gemma later.

394
00:31:01,947 --> 00:31:03,736
Jax, don't you do anything!

395
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:06,071
Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?!

396
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,490
Get her patched up!

397
00:31:07,745 --> 00:31:11,221
Call the rest of your talent,
tell them to lock their goddamn doors!

398
00:31:11,346 --> 00:31:12,361
Sorry.

399
00:31:14,544 --> 00:31:16,044
Should we call Clay?

400
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,369
He's on the guns.
Call the others.

401
00:31:18,494 --> 00:31:20,179
It's baseball time.

402
00:31:20,528 --> 00:31:21,704
Great.

403
00:31:23,404 --> 00:31:24,954
God, you're so stiff,

404
00:31:26,347 --> 00:31:28,219
You won't score in the second half.

405
00:31:30,753 --> 00:31:32,556
Get the hell out!
This is a closed set!

406
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,736
Come on!

407
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:50,819
Get back.
Don't even think about moving.

408
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,452
After I saw
what they did to Lyla, I just...

409
00:31:55,077 --> 00:31:56,664
Get her out of here.

410
00:32:04,514 --> 00:32:07,068
Happy to see you, too, sugar...

411
00:32:10,163 --> 00:32:13,713
You so much as send a friendly
text to any of Luann's girls,

412
00:32:13,856 --> 00:32:16,045
your next movie...

413
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:18,916
Canseco does Georgie.

414
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:23,298
- You understand?
- I get it.

415
00:32:29,523 --> 00:32:31,740
There's a ton of guys
like Georgie out there.

416
00:32:31,865 --> 00:32:34,428
Luann can't pay her talent,
they'll keep coming...

417
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:35,514
So to speak.

418
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:37,397
That's why she wants the 50k.

419
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:39,438
- That's not gonna happen.
- Obviously,

420
00:32:39,563 --> 00:32:41,458
but we can offer her something else:

421
00:32:42,446 --> 00:32:43,502
a partner.

422
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,838
What are you talking about?

423
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:48,454
The empty gun warehouse
we just built.

424
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:50,583
Same size as Caruso films.

425
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:52,553
All of a sudden you're Larry Flint?

426
00:32:53,657 --> 00:32:56,739
Georgie's just a scumbag
with muscle and a lease, right?

427
00:32:56,864 --> 00:32:59,104
His staff and talent
do all the work.

428
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:01,863
We already have staff
and talent: Luann.

429
00:33:02,177 --> 00:33:04,488
So we're the scumbags
with the lease and muscle?

430
00:33:04,613 --> 00:33:05,613
Why not?

431
00:33:05,738 --> 00:33:07,398
We offer her protection, a space,

432
00:33:07,523 --> 00:33:10,779
front her a little cash for the shit
the feds took, split the profits.

433
00:33:11,097 --> 00:33:13,408
And I can upgrade her internet shit.

434
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,801
There's plenty of room
for servers in that space.

435
00:33:15,926 --> 00:33:18,112
- And that's where the real cash is.
- And I was blessed

436
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:19,989
with an excellent eye for casting.

437
00:33:20,114 --> 00:33:22,303
Clubs get into trouble
when they take on too much.

438
00:33:22,428 --> 00:33:25,778
Guns have been downsized.
We could use the extra income.

439
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:30,614
It's a legitimate business.

440
00:33:30,739 --> 00:33:34,178
We run it clean, feds think
we turned over a new leaf, they go away.

441
00:33:34,627 --> 00:33:37,227
And the very least,
we'll get Bobby laid.

442
00:33:41,834 --> 00:33:43,228
Thoughts?

443
00:33:43,737 --> 00:33:45,147
Everybody loves pussy.

444
00:33:45,855 --> 00:33:46,899
I second that.

445
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:49,234
- Third it.
- I'm a very big fan of pussy.

446
00:33:49,832 --> 00:33:52,071
All in favor?
Like I gotta ask.

447
00:33:52,684 --> 00:33:53,829
Pussy!

448
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:55,465
All right,

449
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,405
looks like we're making movies.

450
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,827
We got a delivery to make.

451
00:34:00,033 --> 00:34:02,583
I'll tell Luann
she's got a new partner.

452
00:34:14,606 --> 00:34:15,881
Anyone here?

453
00:34:31,934 --> 00:34:33,379
- Shit.
- You okay?

454
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:34,504
God!

455
00:34:34,886 --> 00:34:36,448
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

456
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,914
I didn't mean to be
such a pain in the ass, Jax.

457
00:34:40,131 --> 00:34:41,931
- Wait a minute.
- Don't.

458
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:44,369
Relax.

459
00:34:44,656 --> 00:34:47,793
You think I brought you here
to Adriana you?

460
00:34:48,482 --> 00:34:49,878
I'm not gonna hurt you.

461
00:34:50,295 --> 00:34:51,505
I'm gonna help you.

462
00:34:56,543 --> 00:34:57,843
Your new studio.

463
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,110
New studio?

464
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:04,167
What do you mean?

465
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,413
You're not gonna be able to compete
without protection and investors.

466
00:35:08,538 --> 00:35:10,816
We're gonna help you
get back on your feet.

467
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,488
Sam Crow as a partner?

468
00:35:14,389 --> 00:35:15,739
What's the split?

469
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,406
50-50,

470
00:35:17,874 --> 00:35:19,241
and our debt goes away.

471
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:22,703
And if I say no?

472
00:35:23,101 --> 00:35:26,051
It's your only play, darling.
We both know that.

473
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:35,469
Life was so much easier
when I was just sucking dick.

474
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,076
All right, boys.

475
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,747
- Two dozen AKs.
- Looks good.

476
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,108
Pay the man.

477
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,813
Go!

478
00:36:40,387 --> 00:36:41,387
Go!

479
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:47,287
Clay, it's the Mayans.

480
00:36:49,456 --> 00:36:52,856
Bobby's been hit in the shoulder!
He's bleeding real bad!

481
00:37:04,703 --> 00:37:07,349
Hold your fire, man!
Let 'em have the guns.

482
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:10,164
- Those are our guns!
- We'll get you more goddamn guns!

483
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:12,104
Gotta take care of our guys.

484
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,260
Jesus Christ!

485
00:37:34,995 --> 00:37:36,737
Let's get the hell out of here!

486
00:37:36,862 --> 00:37:38,162
Nice homecoming.

487
00:37:45,317 --> 00:37:47,067
The information was good.

488
00:37:49,121 --> 00:37:50,211
I owe you.

489
00:37:51,288 --> 00:37:52,694
<i>Yes, you do.</i>

490
00:37:59,335 --> 00:38:00,485
Who was that?

491
00:38:01,711 --> 00:38:02,911
It was just...

492
00:38:03,294 --> 00:38:04,994
a friend from my church.

493
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:38,196
Sorry I'm so late.

494
00:38:42,492 --> 00:38:45,364
- What time is it?
- It's 10:00.

495
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,040
How are you?

496
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:51,664
I'm fine.

497
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:05,092
You need to talk to somebody
about what happened.

498
00:39:05,704 --> 00:39:09,504
- Doesn't mean you're weak. It just...
- That's why I've got you.

499
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,300
Hello.

500
00:39:25,689 --> 00:39:26,989
Shit. I'm sorry.

501
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:29,015
I fell asleep.

502
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,818
- You didn't have to stay.
- It's okay.

503
00:39:34,478 --> 00:39:35,578
Feel better.

504
00:39:42,939 --> 00:39:43,939
Excuse me.

505
00:39:46,824 --> 00:39:49,126
- What?
- I have to go to the clubhouse.

506
00:39:49,251 --> 00:39:50,470
Medical emergency.

507
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,698
- Shit.
- Stay here.

508
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,223
- No.
- Go ahead.

509
00:39:54,649 --> 00:39:56,094
I'll watch him.

510
00:40:05,428 --> 00:40:06,728
Is it all right?

511
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,888
You're lucky,
it went straight through.

512
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,841
Jesus Christ.

513
00:40:16,404 --> 00:40:19,754
The Mayans, they crashed
our little Niner delivery, man.

514
00:40:21,357 --> 00:40:22,669
You okay, bro?

515
00:40:23,271 --> 00:40:24,665
I'm in good hands.

516
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,340
They got away
with two cases of the AKs.

517
00:40:33,156 --> 00:40:34,486
In here.

518
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,020
That little judgment call you made

519
00:41:12,176 --> 00:41:13,722
for the good of the club

520
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:16,431
came back to bite us in the ass.
Almost killed Bobby.

521
00:41:17,003 --> 00:41:18,016
I see that.

522
00:41:18,878 --> 00:41:21,817
Whatever you may think,
the truth is,

523
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:25,587
everything I do is to protect
what we got.

524
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,944
It's never arbitrary...

525
00:41:28,912 --> 00:41:30,779
And it's never reactive.

526
00:41:31,609 --> 00:41:34,605
Been doing this for 30 years.
I know a few things.

527
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:37,289
Taking that tag off the Mayan
was the right decision.

528
00:41:37,414 --> 00:41:38,616
You know that.

529
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,823
You want to challenge me?

530
00:41:40,948 --> 00:41:41,948
Fine.

531
00:41:42,153 --> 00:41:43,653
I don't give a shit.

532
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,922
But the minute it stops
becoming about this club

533
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,383
and it starts becoming personal...

534
00:41:51,727 --> 00:41:53,734
They'll know that.

535
00:41:54,464 --> 00:41:55,974
They'll lose respect for you

536
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:58,249
and they won't trust you anymore.

537
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,521
And then you'll be
