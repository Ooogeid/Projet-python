1
00:00:01,395 --> 00:00:02,814
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:03,939
Shit!

3
00:00:07,602 --> 00:00:08,716
This was Zobelle.

4
00:00:08,885 --> 00:00:11,510
Otto... now Chibs.
This guy's trying to break us.

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,241
This is a hostile work environment

6
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:17,045
claim filed against me and my proxy
by Margaret Murphy. You threatened her.

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,101
I had a passionate conversation
with her.

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,645
This is my livelihood!

9
00:00:20,814 --> 00:00:24,148
The club is the club,
my life is my life. Stay out of it!

10
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:27,526
We need guns. Our distributor is
temporarily offline...

11
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:30,988
INS. He's having a little trouble
getting into the country.

12
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:34,007
We know you deal AK's.
We'll pay double. All you can get us.

13
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:35,880
Why don't you tell me
how I get right

14
00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:38,454
with you trying to kill
a brother behind the club's back?

15
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:41,167
Your little trigger boy blowing
an innocent woman's head off.

16
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:43,993
If you mention Donna
or the incident again,

17
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:45,597
I'll kill ya.

18
00:00:45,722 --> 00:00:48,381
- Your new porn studio.
- Sam Crow as a partner?

19
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,575
- All of a sudden you're Larry Flynt?
- We offer her protection, a space,

20
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,878
front her a little cash
for the shit the feds took,

21
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:56,597
- split the profits.
- You're one of Luann's girls.

22
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:58,516
Opie. She's been helping me out.

23
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:00,559
- You serious about it?
- The kids like her.

24
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,104
Otto said
some guy's giving you trouble.

25
00:01:03,273 --> 00:01:05,984
Shitbag's threatening my girls
if they don't join his company.

26
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:08,109
Saw some wood splinters.
Probably a bat.

27
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:11,529
Sorry to interrupt. We just found
Luann Delaney off County 18

28
00:01:11,698 --> 00:01:13,990
- beaten to death.
- Did you cause this?

29
00:01:14,228 --> 00:01:17,124
- The hell are you talking about?
- Payback? Caracara?

30
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:19,349
I'm not the one murdering women!

31
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:31,525
You okay?

32
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:38,078
Something that brutal...

33
00:01:41,316 --> 00:01:42,416
had to be...

34
00:01:43,153 --> 00:01:44,303
payback or...

35
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,130
a message.

36
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:48,403
We don't know.

37
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,740
It could have been
the scumbag producer.

38
00:01:55,795 --> 00:01:58,095
We roughed up Caruso a couple times.

39
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:03,129
When?

40
00:02:05,253 --> 00:02:06,253
Yesterday.

41
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:22,331
You should go, Jax.

42
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:35,272
I'm sorry, man.

43
00:02:49,963 --> 00:02:51,613
All right, thanks, man.

44
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:55,129
- Rosen.
- Where's he at with the charges?

45
00:02:55,254 --> 00:02:57,632
The quality
of the security video is shit.

46
00:02:57,757 --> 00:02:59,553
He's gonna push to have it tossed,

47
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,710
and most of the families
at the Christian Center

48
00:03:03,004 --> 00:03:04,517
don't want to get involved.

49
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,635
That should slow down the DA.

50
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:08,123
Gentlemen.

51
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:13,417
So, I couldn't come through
on your guns.

52
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,427
ATF's got eyes on my supplier.

53
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:20,825
Not what I wanted to hear.

54
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,508
I'm hoping to make it up to you.

55
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:25,877
You mentioned
that your gun source has INS issues?

56
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:27,381
Maybe we can help.

57
00:03:27,506 --> 00:03:30,706
It's no secret you're losing
your slice of the H pie.

58
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:34,331
You need guns to guard your corners,
I need a new pipeline.

59
00:03:35,193 --> 00:03:36,340
Work together.

60
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,030
Got my guy detained in Oakland.

61
00:03:46,444 --> 00:03:50,315
New level of security. Customs flagged
his passport and visa as bogus.

62
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,176
He's claiming
it's a technical error.

63
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:55,401
- And if INS starts digging?
- They find the truth.

64
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:58,274
Mahmoud Sakairi: ex-PLO.

65
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,960
Gun feed heads
straight back to Hamas.

66
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,150
Hearing's tomorrow morning.

67
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:05,991
And your crew couldn't persuade
the judge?

68
00:04:06,116 --> 00:04:08,107
Too risky.
My guys show up,

69
00:04:08,232 --> 00:04:09,879
the judge doesn't spook,

70
00:04:10,004 --> 00:04:12,668
they'll start digging
into Mahmoud's Asian contacts.

71
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:13,630
But

72
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:16,605
a bunch of white guys
twist the judge's arm...

73
00:04:17,853 --> 00:04:19,453
You all look the same.

74
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:24,803
We do this,

75
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:28,570
you make sure Mahmoud opens up
his pipeline to the Sons.

76
00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:32,021
We'll both be in your debt.

77
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:37,243
Room 208.

78
00:04:38,168 --> 00:04:39,518
Have a good time.

79
00:04:47,915 --> 00:04:49,121
Son of a bitch.

80
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:54,251
Let's get out of here.

81
00:04:57,354 --> 00:04:58,354
Shit!

82
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,092
Date's over, kids.
Come on. Get your clothes on.

83
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:05,719
Five girls, four johns.

84
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,885
Couple of 'em in possession.

85
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,933
Crank.

86
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,857
Pussy and a bump.

87
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:13,729
- Has to be Darby.
- Excuse me, Chief...

88
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,473
Skinny blonde says
she's gotta talk to you.

89
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,236
This is a mistake, okay?
We were set up.

90
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:24,698
Call our boss. He'll tell you.

91
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,141
You willing to give up Darby?

92
00:05:28,422 --> 00:05:30,079
We don't work for that scumbag.

93
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:31,615
Who's your boss?

94
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,629
<i>Riding through this world</i>

95
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:41,424
<i>All alone</i>

96
00:05:42,794 --> 00:05:44,431
<i>God takes your soul</i>

97
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,396
<i>You're on your own</i>

98
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,516
<i>The crow flies straight</i>

99
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,469
<i>A perfect line</i>

100
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:56,605
<i>On the devil's bed</i>

101
00:05:58,102 --> 00:05:59,252
<i>Until you die</i>

102
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:03,829
<i>Gotta look this life</i>

103
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:06,573
<i>In the eye.</i>

104
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:10,388
Episode 209: Fa Guan

105
00:06:16,654 --> 00:06:17,790
Get in here.

106
00:06:18,155 --> 00:06:19,555
Made banana bread.

107
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,360
Want a piece? Still warm.

108
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:23,918
Shut the door.

109
00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:35,793
Unser picked up two of your cum divas
in a low-rent hooker sting.

110
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,273
I knew getting into porn
was a bad call.

111
00:06:39,687 --> 00:06:40,816
I want us out.

112
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:44,743
Losing Luann

113
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:47,381
was awful,
but we have other directors.

114
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:50,026
Caracara is in full swing.

115
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,753
It's a solid moneymaker.

116
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,497
It's dirty and I'm done with it.

117
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,208
Liquidate.
You sell off whatever you can.

118
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:00,755
Porn is Jax's deal.

119
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,230
- We all voted yes.
- Close it down!

120
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,130
I'll handle the little prince.

121
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:14,129
- What do we got?
- The INS judge is small-time, man.

122
00:07:14,254 --> 00:07:15,753
Close to retirement.

123
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:19,428
He lives alone, cushy little suburb
just outside of Oakland.

124
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:22,391
Widower, one kid.
Son at Berkeley.

125
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,703
That's our emotional leverage.
Kid...

126
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:27,530
is local, he's exposed.
We threaten that.

127
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:33,945
I told Lin we're gonna have to see
the guns we're risking our ass for,

128
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:37,611
so I arranged to have
a little hardware test. That's you.

129
00:07:37,736 --> 00:07:38,736
What?

130
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,290
- Who's gonna press the judge?
- Bobby and Ope.

131
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,194
And you take Happy with you.
He'll know how to persuade.

132
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,669
This is bullshit.

133
00:07:53,194 --> 00:07:54,544
Give us a minute.

134
00:08:03,077 --> 00:08:04,365
What the hell is this,

135
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,944
"testing hardware"?
What am I, a goddamn prospect?

136
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,662
This ain't about you.

137
00:08:09,316 --> 00:08:10,405
It's about Ope.

138
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:12,954
It's important we bring him closer.

139
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,209
The deeper in he gets,
the more we're protected.

140
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:21,434
Yeah, and the more you hurt Jax.

141
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,969
I don't give a shit about Jax.

142
00:08:28,597 --> 00:08:30,147
How did Otto take it?

143
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:35,383
Same way any of us would.

144
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:38,567
- Do we know her?
- Not yet.

145
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:41,879
Georgie and his crew left
for Thailand this morning.

146
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:43,454
It's a buying trip.

147
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,773
Fleeing the scene.

148
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:46,733
That's where my money lands.

149
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,374
Luann is not your fault.

150
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:58,429
Take a lap, kid.

151
00:08:59,441 --> 00:09:00,441
All right.

152
00:09:09,692 --> 00:09:10,883
Fiona was here.

153
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,470
- When?
- Yesterday.

154
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,757
Apparently,
my kid got wind of the accident.

155
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:20,267
Fi came to make sure I was okay.

156
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:22,292
Jimmy O with her?

157
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,890
I didn't see him,

158
00:09:24,807 --> 00:09:26,720
but he'd never let her
travel on her own,

159
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:28,295
so he must be here.

160
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:33,256
When we were inside,

161
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:36,783
Stahl had photos
of Zobelle with Cameron

162
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:40,256
trying to get us
to sell out the IRA.

163
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:42,331
Cameron's selling to Zobelle?

164
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,500
Confirmed it yesterday.

165
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,740
We lost the Irish pipeline.

166
00:09:50,035 --> 00:09:51,666
Jimmy'll be going mad.

167
00:09:52,838 --> 00:09:54,638
It wasn't our choice, man.

168
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:56,841
It doesn't matter.

169
00:09:57,381 --> 00:10:00,021
He'll still find a way
of blaming me.

170
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,357
Just checking up.
Chief Unser's looking for you.

171
00:10:11,884 --> 00:10:13,070
We'll handle it.

172
00:10:13,754 --> 00:10:15,254
You just get better.

173
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:22,069
You okay?

174
00:10:32,683 --> 00:10:34,380
I talked to Dr. Gallagher.

175
00:10:34,505 --> 00:10:36,355
We're taking you
off the critical list.

176
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,595
You should be able to go home
in about a week or so.

177
00:10:39,256 --> 00:10:40,606
That's good news.

178
00:10:42,324 --> 00:10:44,874
I appreciate
you looking after me, Tara.

179
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:48,153
- You're a good girl.
- You're welcome.

180
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:52,707
You do know
your insurance has lapsed?

181
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,678
Yeah, my last birthday,

182
00:10:55,037 --> 00:10:58,334
seems that I aged
into the unaffordable bracket.

183
00:11:00,737 --> 00:11:03,870
You're gonna have to finish
your recuperation at Stockton Memorial.

184
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,108
Come on, Doc.

185
00:11:08,103 --> 00:11:09,695
Give me a few more days.

186
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,796
There's nothing I can do. It's out
of my hands. It's hospital policy.

187
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:15,998
I'll do the rest
of my mending at home.

188
00:11:16,123 --> 00:11:20,127
- Stockton has a good cranial expert...
- I don't give a shit about my head.

189
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:23,697
Do you think I'm gonna be lying
on my goddamn back

190
00:11:23,822 --> 00:11:25,422
somewhere unprotected?

191
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:32,891
Ran a sting this morning,
prostitution.

192
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,630
Logger Point Motel.

193
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:36,486
Hookers in Charming?

194
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:39,019
Hookers and movie stars.

195
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,616
Two of them
were your Caracara girls.

196
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:43,577
Want to talk to their boss.

197
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:46,934
Perfect.

198
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:53,035
You okay?

199
00:11:58,459 --> 00:11:59,843
Anything on Luann?

200
00:12:01,563 --> 00:12:03,139
Crime scene is clean.

201
00:12:03,487 --> 00:12:05,287
Right now, we got nothing.

202
00:12:08,401 --> 00:12:10,145
Can you give me a few minutes?

203
00:12:14,504 --> 00:12:15,817
You need anything?

204
00:12:17,256 --> 00:12:18,556
Honey, I'm fine.

205
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,020
I'm fine.

206
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:23,255
All right.

207
00:12:24,387 --> 00:12:26,537
Catch up with you at the station.

208
00:12:31,328 --> 00:12:34,628
Wanted to make sure this Luann thing
doesn't get you...

209
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:36,672
overreacting.

210
00:12:39,388 --> 00:12:40,967
You think it was Zobelle?

211
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:43,674
Do you?

212
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:50,379
Zobelle didn't kill me.

213
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:53,504
He's not gonna risk murder
on someone like Luann.

214
00:12:54,212 --> 00:12:55,912
Doesn't cut deep enough.

215
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:58,387
That makes sense.

216
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:02,694
You okay?

217
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:08,029
I keep forgetting to take that
stupid pill that helps my equilibrium.

218
00:13:09,441 --> 00:13:12,141
Della's helping you
monitor the meds, yeah?

219
00:13:13,754 --> 00:13:16,427
She went to...

220
00:13:17,257 --> 00:13:19,307
be with her mother for a while.

221
00:13:22,054 --> 00:13:23,469
Been three months.

222
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:29,349
You been going
through this shit all alone?

223
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:32,835
I'm a prick, Gemma.

224
00:13:34,442 --> 00:13:36,392
Treatments make me miserable.

225
00:13:38,658 --> 00:13:40,709
It's the best thing for now.

226
00:13:44,254 --> 00:13:45,904
If you need anything...

227
00:13:48,268 --> 00:13:49,618
just let me know.

228
00:13:54,246 --> 00:13:56,248
Folks in my support group

229
00:13:56,373 --> 00:13:58,888
been going to this revival service.

230
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:00,909
Was gonna check it out.

231
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,033
Use a ride tomorrow morning.

232
00:14:08,713 --> 00:14:10,098
I'll clear my calendar.

233
00:14:12,946 --> 00:14:14,943
You know, this thing with Luann...

234
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:16,846
Maybe you should take
a few days off.

235
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:19,134
We're all logging extra time
on the sex cams,

236
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,709
trying to help Jax.

237
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:22,851
I'm just saying.

238
00:14:22,976 --> 00:14:25,630
If you want to take some downtime,
I'd help you out.

239
00:14:25,755 --> 00:14:28,200
I'm not looking
to be taken care of, Op.

240
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,451
This is what I do.

241
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,103
I know.

242
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,656
Better be getting back.

243
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,086
- Will I see you later?
- It's gonna be a pretty late one.

244
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,505
Bobby's sister's watching the kids.

245
00:14:42,672 --> 00:14:44,522
I don't mind watching them.

246
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:47,684
I'll bring Piper by,
rent a movie or something.

247
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:48,803
That's okay.

248
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,639
Can't keep doing this to you.

249
00:14:51,832 --> 00:14:53,730
I like going to your place.

250
00:14:55,691 --> 00:14:57,091
Feels like a home.

251
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:02,739
See you in the morning.

252
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:30,466
Is that okay?

253
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,683
Keep an eye on Lyla.

254
00:15:45,808 --> 00:15:47,709
Anything happens, give us a call.

255
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:48,864
I accept that.

256
00:15:55,195 --> 00:15:57,345
Come on, Legs, you got a visitor.

257
00:16:06,864 --> 00:16:09,009
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Got a phone call,

258
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,462
wouldn't give his name.

259
00:16:10,587 --> 00:16:12,470
Offered us ten grand
to help out Darby.

260
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,848
What do you mean "help out"?

261
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,631
He wanted his johns thinking
they had some high-end pussy.

262
00:16:17,756 --> 00:16:19,519
Two days of work, that was the deal.

263
00:16:20,131 --> 00:16:23,315
- And day one, the cops show up.
- It had to be Georgie.

264
00:16:23,643 --> 00:16:25,893
Psycho killed Luann, got us busted.

265
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,238
- When did you get the call?
- Day before yesterday.

266
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:32,319
That's before we hassled Georgie.

267
00:16:32,444 --> 00:16:33,895
Setup's not on him.

268
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,410
Then who is it?

269
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:37,613
I don't know.

270
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,382
Aren't you gonna bail us out?

271
00:16:41,507 --> 00:16:44,044
Let me just get an advance
on my trust fund.

272
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:53,720
Your tip panned out.

273
00:16:54,656 --> 00:16:55,806
To be honest,

274
00:16:56,244 --> 00:16:58,256
I'm surprised you acted on it.

275
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:03,673
Where else is Darby
dealing crank and pussy?

276
00:17:06,398 --> 00:17:08,258
I'm not quite certain you and I

277
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:10,525
are on the same page yet, David.

278
00:17:11,628 --> 00:17:14,278
I thought by now
we'd be working together.

279
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:18,415
That security footage of me
and Darby is bullshit.

280
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,690
It's nothing.

281
00:17:20,402 --> 00:17:22,085
Nothing criminal.

282
00:17:22,571 --> 00:17:24,912
But I think it would raise enough
eyebrows on city council

283
00:17:25,037 --> 00:17:27,587
to throw your appointment
as chief into question.

284
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,540
Darby's got a cooker
in an old motor home...

285
00:17:34,665 --> 00:17:36,656
scrap metal yard off Manion.

286
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,423
Also, another low-rent brothel
at the Red Oak Suites.

287
00:17:41,551 --> 00:17:42,901
That's all of it.

288
00:17:43,181 --> 00:17:45,126
This is your last chance.

289
00:17:46,172 --> 00:17:48,216
Do your job.

290
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,907
How'd it go with the Chinese?

291
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:08,545
What?

292
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,904
Clay heard
what happened to the girls.

293
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:13,717
That and Luann.
He wants me to kill Caracara.

294
00:18:15,146 --> 00:18:17,262
It's club action;
he can't shut it down.

295
00:18:17,578 --> 00:18:19,055
He don't give a shit.

296
00:18:21,855 --> 00:18:25,757
Someone paid our girls
to be on Darby's roster today,

297
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,583
wanted them to get busted.

298
00:18:29,596 --> 00:18:31,985
You think Clay needed
an excuse to shut me down?

299
00:18:33,265 --> 00:18:36,197
I'm not sure I know what either
one of you would do anymore.

300
00:18:49,105 --> 00:18:50,473
We need Caracara.

301
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,349
It's our only club income.

302
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:56,010
Gun biz is back online.

303
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,585
New 20, new source.

304
00:18:59,411 --> 00:19:00,722
We're done with pussy.

305
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:04,567
Just for a minute,

306
00:19:04,692 --> 00:19:07,687
try to think past this bullshit
between you and me.

307
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,034
Porn is a legitimate business, Clay.

308
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:11,858
So is auto repair.

309
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:13,694
And that don't make my skin crawl.

310
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,732
Look at your run with guns
over the last few years.

311
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:19,043
We've lost more than we've earned.

312
00:19:19,168 --> 00:19:20,468
Money and blood.

313
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,661
- That's gonna change.
- With the Chinese?

314
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:27,882
We don't even know
if this pipeline is real

315
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,745
or where the guns are coming from.

316
00:19:33,346 --> 00:19:34,676
Jesus Christ.

317
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:37,039
That's where you're putting
the future of our club.

318
00:19:37,164 --> 00:19:39,283
Sam Crow deals guns.

319
00:19:41,485 --> 00:19:44,578
You had your little romp
as porn king.

320
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,686
You tied us to prostitution, you got
one of our member's old lady killed.

321
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,154
You are really gonna stand there

322
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,813
and lay the guilt
of a dead wife on me?

323
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:04,661
You remember that promise I made.

324
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:11,749
Let me make it easy for you.

325
00:20:42,347 --> 00:20:43,867
You need a majority vote

326
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:45,781
to shut down Caracara.

327
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,208
We put it out
at church tomorrow night.

328
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,648
Want to tell me what
that dead wife shit was about?

329
00:21:17,578 --> 00:21:18,946
Otto knew, man.

330
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:22,043
I got Luann killed.

331
00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:26,562
You thought you were
doing the right thing.

332
00:21:31,618 --> 00:21:33,787
I was tapping Luann.

333
00:21:34,486 --> 00:21:35,501
You serious?

334
00:21:36,908 --> 00:21:38,546
Ever since I took over her books.

335
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:41,674
How was that?

336
00:21:42,771 --> 00:21:44,687
A little scary.

337
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,230
You're covered, I guess.

338
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:50,711
Prison clause.

339
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:53,687
I know, but it still feels shitty.

340
00:21:56,226 --> 00:21:57,351
Sorry, man.

341
00:21:58,075 --> 00:21:59,443
We move on,

342
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:01,852
right?

343
00:22:05,655 --> 00:22:08,034
Clay...
he's not gonna get a majority vote.

344
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,371
The guys, they love porn.
They practically live at the studio.

345
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,189
That's why he hates it.

346
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:16,144
Cum equals cash, brother.

347
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:17,686
We all know it.

348
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,412
Caracara ain't going nowhere.

349
00:22:27,989 --> 00:22:29,239
We got to talk,

350
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,183
- you and me, alone.
- I'm done with alone.

351
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,186
Anything you got to say,
Bobby can hear.

352
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,170
It's about Opie.

353
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:42,641
Clay's got him on point,
working this judge.

354
00:22:43,194 --> 00:22:44,245
Nothing I can do.

355
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,780
If this thing goes bad

356
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:49,284
and Opie has to go down that road,
there's no way he's coming back.

357
00:22:53,266 --> 00:22:56,266
You're worried about losing
your right-hand seat.

358
00:22:59,691 --> 00:23:01,991
We both know why shit's upside down.

359
00:23:06,321 --> 00:23:07,571
Keep Ope light.

360
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,055
I'll show up after I check
those guns and work this judge.

361
00:23:11,455 --> 00:23:13,285
The way me and Ope are going,

362
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:16,602
I try and talk him down, it may be
the very thing that pushes him to it.

363
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:19,491
Maybe you should tag along anyhow.

364
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:31,133
I'll meet you at that judge's house.

365
00:23:40,777 --> 00:23:43,148
Zobelle is putting down roots.

366
00:23:44,726 --> 00:23:47,410
He's backing my brother for mayor,

367
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,710
and he wants me on his team
once I'm chief.

368
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,350
Why are you telling me this?

369
00:23:52,501 --> 00:23:55,516
Aren't the Hale's on board
for the bright new day?

370
00:23:56,493 --> 00:23:58,728
I know the greater devil
when I see it.

371
00:23:58,942 --> 00:24:00,892
Zobelle is flooding this town

372
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:03,316
with Darby's crank and pussy.

373
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:04,942
And he wants me to shut it down

374
00:24:05,138 --> 00:24:07,487
to prove to Charming
they don't need the Sons.

375
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:12,697
You have till the end
of the day to be heroes.

376
00:24:18,684 --> 00:24:21,384
You had to swallow
a lot to hand this over.

377
00:24:22,846 --> 00:24:24,545
It's not about humility.

378
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,090
My biggest priority
will be shutting you down.

379
00:24:31,184 --> 00:24:33,384
But I'm gonna do it the right way.

380
00:24:47,706 --> 00:24:48,611
Where's Hap?

381
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:50,304
I'm taking Clay's lead.

382
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:51,989
Getting back into guns.

383
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,534
Clay's cool with it.

384
00:25:11,382 --> 00:25:13,411
Why aren't you with Bobby and Ope?

385
00:25:13,536 --> 00:25:15,263
Jax said he was handling it.

386
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,703
Call your Nomads.

387
00:25:22,976 --> 00:25:24,243
We need bodies.

388
00:25:24,892 --> 00:25:26,452
We've been deputized.

389
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:29,412
Come on.

390
00:25:30,015 --> 00:25:32,015
You get that door right there.

391
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,994
- Too much brown sugar.
- Pack up the hams, baby.

392
00:26:04,718 --> 00:26:06,518
Wanted to say I was sorry.

393
00:26:07,986 --> 00:26:11,136
I shouldn't have interfered
with things around here.

394
00:26:13,662 --> 00:26:17,666
I told Chibs I was transferring him
to Stockton Memorial... he freaked out,

395
00:26:18,663 --> 00:26:21,197
panicked.
Said he would be unprotected.

396
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:23,362
Someone just blew him up.

397
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:25,726
He's a little twitchy.

398
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:28,455
But...

399
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,380
you do what you got to do,

400
00:26:31,712 --> 00:26:33,591
and we'll figure out
a way to keep him safe.

401
00:26:34,005 --> 00:26:35,039
From what?

402
00:26:36,701 --> 00:26:39,926
Jesus, when does this settle?
When does it stop?

403
00:26:43,824 --> 00:26:45,547
I don't know, baby.

404
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:58,658
Shit!

405
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,135
You white boys never learn.

406
00:27:14,074 --> 00:27:15,763
You and PD keep whacking the mole...

407
00:27:15,888 --> 00:27:19,538
- we keep popping up someplace else.
- Whacking days are done.

408
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:22,296
Zobelle sold you out.
No more money,

409
00:27:22,421 --> 00:27:24,113
no more Aryan muscle.

410
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,020
I smell the stink of your crank
or your pussy anywhere near Charming,

411
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,764
I'll put three bullets
in your neck...

412
00:27:31,531 --> 00:27:33,528
compliments of Charming PD.

413
00:27:34,171 --> 00:27:35,271
Light it up.

414
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:37,299
Shit.

415
00:27:38,217 --> 00:27:39,217
Move.

416
00:27:58,794 --> 00:27:59,989
Judge is in the gate.

417
00:28:03,774 --> 00:28:05,933
Take him down.
I'll cover the yard.

418
00:28:14,242 --> 00:28:15,492
Don't make a...

419
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:17,533
Shut up!

420
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:20,239
Shut up.

421
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:26,417
Take what you want
and get the hell out.

422
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,573
There's no money.
Just what's in the wallet.

423
00:28:29,698 --> 00:28:32,501
We're not here to rob you.
We need your help with a problem.

424
00:28:33,162 --> 00:28:34,312
What problem?

425
00:28:36,157 --> 00:28:37,157
Got it.

426
00:28:38,075 --> 00:28:39,225
Easy, junior.

427
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,702
Get in there.

428
00:28:43,094 --> 00:28:44,472
You son of a bitch.

429
00:28:44,706 --> 00:28:45,973
Is this you, Alex?

430
00:28:46,098 --> 00:28:47,308
Are you the problem?

431
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:49,377
What, he owe you drug money?

432
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,929
What the hell you talking about?

433
00:28:52,054 --> 00:28:53,962
You low-life, junkie piece of shit.

434
00:28:54,087 --> 00:28:56,137
Your mother would be disgusted.

435
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,922
- Stay down
- Jesus Christ.

436
00:29:03,047 --> 00:29:05,328
So much for our emotional leverage.

437
00:29:10,395 --> 00:29:12,751
I don't care how pissed off he is,
hewon't let us hurt his kid,

438
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,276
junkie or not.
We stick to the plan.

439
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:19,315
Mahmoud Sakairi. He's got
a deportation hearing tomorrow morning.

440
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,092
It's a simple misunderstanding.

441
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,053
Dismiss it,
everyone walks away from this whole.

442
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:27,598
This is about throwing out a case?

443
00:29:29,871 --> 00:29:33,875
23 years on the bench, I've never
been swayed by anyone or anything.

444
00:29:34,751 --> 00:29:36,601
I'm not going to start now.

445
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:38,243
Let me be clear.

446
00:29:39,596 --> 00:29:43,188
You throw out the case
or I cut your family in half.

447
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:46,730
You won't.

448
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:50,465
I'll beat him,

449
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,790
I'll break off his fingers
and then I'll kill him.

450
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,457
Jesus Christ,

451
00:29:57,582 --> 00:29:59,288
just give him what he wants.

452
00:29:59,413 --> 00:30:02,842
- Dad, they're going to kill me.
- He is not going to kill you.

453
00:30:09,201 --> 00:30:10,891
- Get off of me.
- You cannot

454
00:30:11,016 --> 00:30:13,712
- just blow holes in this kid.
- I barely winged his toe.

455
00:30:13,837 --> 00:30:16,504
The old man is going to break. I don't
give a shit how bad the blood is.

456
00:30:16,629 --> 00:30:19,859
No father is going to let his son die
in front of him. Get out of my way.

457
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,690
The toe stung.

458
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:28,901
The knee...

459
00:30:29,391 --> 00:30:32,141
it's going to make him
want to kill himself.

460
00:30:32,496 --> 00:30:34,415
If you're going to kill him,
just do it.

461
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:38,927
I'm not going to give you
what you want.

462
00:30:39,052 --> 00:30:41,652
So torturing him is just
a waste of time.

463
00:30:42,198 --> 00:30:44,098
You might as well shoot him.

464
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,896
This what you want?

465
00:30:57,226 --> 00:30:59,148
This how you protect your family?

466
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:00,317
Dad!

467
00:31:05,802 --> 00:31:08,003
You're going to let me
kill your kid, huh?

468
00:31:08,128 --> 00:31:10,342
That's how you protect your blood?

469
00:31:12,703 --> 00:31:14,443
Open your eyes, you piece of shit!

470
00:31:14,568 --> 00:31:16,849
Open your eyes!
You see it!

471
00:31:17,157 --> 00:31:20,419
You look at what you've done!
You see what you've caused!

472
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,505
Look at what you've done
to your family!

473
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:27,312
Open your mouth!

474
00:31:46,568 --> 00:31:47,568
It's done.

475
00:31:51,738 --> 00:31:52,895
Shit.

476
00:32:09,646 --> 00:32:10,646
Your turn.

477
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:13,104
I can't,

478
00:32:13,232 --> 00:32:15,145
I can't do...***

479
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,390
Shit, guys.

480
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:23,232
Go look for something.
Anything that'll help.

481
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,430
Go, go.

482
00:32:32,344 --> 00:32:33,344
Relax.

483
00:32:53,525 --> 00:32:54,725
I'm all right.

484
00:32:58,339 --> 00:32:59,339
I know.

485
00:33:45,146 --> 00:33:46,346
What happened?

486
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:48,960
Severe head pain.
He can't see out of his right eye.

487
00:33:49,085 --> 00:33:51,139
Dr. Gallagher ordered an MRI.

488
00:33:56,988 --> 00:33:58,088
Thanks, Doc.

489
00:34:02,262 --> 00:34:05,376
- He should be put back on critical.
- Dr. Gallagher already did.

490
00:34:13,865 --> 00:34:15,643
You bankroll me,
back me with muscle,

491
00:34:15,768 --> 00:34:17,849
and then you yank it out
from under me?

492
00:34:17,974 --> 00:34:20,619
Navigating around law enforcement
is a game of give and take.

493
00:34:20,744 --> 00:34:21,944
It wasn't PD.

494
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:23,245
It was Clay.

495
00:34:23,927 --> 00:34:26,505
He told me you sold me out and seeing
as how all three of my interests

496
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,530
have been crushed today,
I tend to believe him.

497
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:36,772
Do you want recompense
against Sam Crow?

498
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:40,649
It means "payback. "

499
00:34:42,595 --> 00:34:44,498
I know what it means, asshole.

500
00:34:51,351 --> 00:34:52,801
I want to hurt 'em.

501
00:35:04,259 --> 00:35:06,634
I'm going to hit outside.
Storage shed.

502
00:35:06,759 --> 00:35:09,105
They'll see the flames
from the highway.

503
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,525
Alarms are cut.
Keep it contained to the inside.

504
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:14,862
This thing will cook all night
before the flames are visible.

505
00:35:17,595 --> 00:35:18,490
Let's go.

506
00:35:46,184 --> 00:35:49,784
What do you think? You think
I got a future in this business.

507
00:35:52,155 --> 00:35:53,555
That should do it.

508
00:35:56,653 --> 00:35:59,656
- What the hell?!
- Your need had a short lifespan.

509
00:36:07,628 --> 00:36:09,148
We got something.

510
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:15,288
Please, no.

511
00:36:16,052 --> 00:36:17,846
You can't. Please.

512
00:36:19,189 --> 00:36:20,639
Throw out the case.

513
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,053
Love letters.

514
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:29,701
Found a room upstairs.
God damn shrine to his dead wife.

515
00:36:39,233 --> 00:36:41,281
You don't throw out the case
tomorrow morning,

516
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:44,758
or you tell anyone about us,
we trash wifely's room.

517
00:36:45,835 --> 00:36:47,685
Burn every memory you have.

518
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:07,217
Okay.
We made it work.

519
00:37:07,342 --> 00:37:09,434
Then we waited
at the house for the call.

520
00:37:09,998 --> 00:37:12,548
It's done.
The judge dismissed the case.

521
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:14,857
It's all good.
I checked out Lin's guns.

522
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:17,320
MP-5s- really good hardware, man.

523
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:28,489
Where they going?

524
00:37:28,964 --> 00:37:29,964
Home.

525
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,480
How long you gonna be?

526
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,427
Aren't you coming in?

527
00:37:39,552 --> 00:37:40,481
No, I can't.

528
00:37:40,606 --> 00:37:42,406
I got some errands to run.

529
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:45,505
About an hour.

530
00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:47,375
I'll call you.

531
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,037
I know you?

532
00:38:08,751 --> 00:38:10,334
Everyone knows me.

533
00:39:40,189 --> 00:39:41,295
Good morning.

534
00:40:19,922 --> 00:40:21,337
That was Hale.

535
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:23,420
He just tried you on the cell.

536
00:40:25,851 --> 00:40:26,851
What?

537
00:41:05,761 --> 00:41:07,206
Unbelievable.

538
00:41:16,412 --> 00:41:17,599
This was Clay.

539
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:24,374
Couldn't let me have it.

540
00:41:26,097 --> 00:41:27,570
Talk to Quinn.

541
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:29,638
Tell him I want to transfer.

542
00:41:30,963 --> 00:41:32,263
I'm going Nomad.

543
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:41,957
