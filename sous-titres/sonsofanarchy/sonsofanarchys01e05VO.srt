1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,463
Somebody help me, please!

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,012
I don't know, I swear!

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:09,569
Somebody help me, please!

4
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:10,702
Please!

5
00:00:13,028 --> 00:00:16,143
Lin will get him when he gets out.
Sam Crow can't protect his ass forever.

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,138
- You okay?
- Yes.

7
00:00:30,124 --> 00:00:31,321
Thanks, Otto.

8
00:00:33,798 --> 00:00:35,636
Those guys don't give up, huh?

9
00:00:35,756 --> 00:00:37,499
They never will, Chucky.

10
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,083
I'm out of here tomorrow.

11
00:00:39,758 --> 00:00:41,335
Don't worry, I'm setting it up.

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,507
You're a good friend, Otto.

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,220
Not that good a friend.

14
00:00:57,168 --> 00:00:59,104
How did you get this thing in here?

15
00:00:59,264 --> 00:01:00,268
By myself.

16
00:01:02,757 --> 00:01:03,791
Sorry.

17
00:01:08,737 --> 00:01:09,787
Looks great.

18
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,272
How much?

19
00:01:12,826 --> 00:01:14,076
Forget it, it's a gift.

20
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:18,914
No, Jax, I don't want...

21
00:01:19,075 --> 00:01:20,943
I'm the one getting a deal.

22
00:01:25,356 --> 00:01:27,129
I'll see you at the fund-raiser.

23
00:01:27,249 --> 00:01:28,819
That Taste of Charming thing?

24
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:30,697
I'm doing the fireworks.

25
00:01:31,273 --> 00:01:32,261
Really?

26
00:01:33,116 --> 00:01:34,555
It's not a club thing, Donna.

27
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,016
Yeah, my mom started it years ago.

28
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:40,677
- Raising money for the school district.
- We'll be there.

29
00:01:40,797 --> 00:01:41,730
All right.

30
00:01:44,174 --> 00:01:45,783
Come on, it'll be fun.

31
00:01:46,074 --> 00:01:47,776
Give me some time
to hang with the kids.

32
00:01:48,632 --> 00:01:50,071
We'll go for a little while.

33
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:52,492
Thanks. How much he give you?

34
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,162
None of your business.

35
00:02:00,564 --> 00:02:02,991
Tell everyone to leave room
for the buses.

36
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:05,861
- Who we bussing?
- Oakdale Assisted Living.

37
00:02:06,172 --> 00:02:08,422
Seniors are all compulsive gamblers.

38
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:10,593
Triples our raffle dollars.

39
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,475
God bless Social Security.

40
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:14,127
Gemma.

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,741
Oh, hey, April.

42
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:18,466
- Appreciate you coming to help.
- No problem.

43
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:19,850
Can I ask you something?

44
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:21,880
What?

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,369
Charlie's band's playing during
the fireworks tomorrow night.

46
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:27,066
He really wants his dad to come.

47
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,405
Shit, April,

48
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,987
I don't think Clay
is going to go for...

49
00:02:32,149 --> 00:02:34,241
I would never ask
anything like this.

50
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:37,711
Me and you, we understand
what went down, but my kids...

51
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:39,536
Charlie doesn't know.

52
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:42,806
It breaks his heart that his dad
can't come to anything around here...

53
00:02:42,926 --> 00:02:44,678
No baseball games,
no school stuff...

54
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,683
All right, all right, all right.

55
00:02:46,803 --> 00:02:49,353
- I'll bring it up to Clay.
- Thank you.

56
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:51,340
I can't promise anything.

57
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:57,827
Thanks for bringing
this to the club.

58
00:02:57,947 --> 00:03:00,556
- They guys send their best.
- All good, man.

59
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:03,032
So who else is looking
to meet with your friend?

60
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:05,187
He's got a couple of buddies
in Chinatown.

61
00:03:05,364 --> 00:03:08,023
They'd love to find him.
Show him a good time.

62
00:03:08,143 --> 00:03:10,567
If we pick him up,
show him a good time first,

63
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:12,236
how grateful is Chuck?

64
00:03:13,835 --> 00:03:15,214
Probably bake you

65
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:16,926
two honey cakes.

66
00:03:20,672 --> 00:03:21,725
You trust him?

67
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:23,745
Been watching his back
for 18 months.

68
00:03:23,865 --> 00:03:25,477
Know him pretty good.

69
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:26,788
I trust him.

70
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:29,962
- All right, we'll show him around.
- Good.

71
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,790
You make sure
my gratitude goes to Luann.

72
00:03:33,051 --> 00:03:34,601
- Absolutely.
- Otto.

73
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:40,549
Listen...

74
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:42,036
Chuck.

75
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:44,162
He's got a couple of issues.

76
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:46,613
It's a nervous tic kind of a thing.

77
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:49,101
Tics we can deal with.

78
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:52,966
No doubt.

79
00:03:57,346 --> 00:03:58,367
Hey, baby.

80
00:03:58,487 --> 00:03:59,783
All set for your picnic?

81
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:01,324
It's a fund-raiser.

82
00:04:01,444 --> 00:04:03,747
Who we raising funds for this year?

83
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:05,917
Music department, middle school.

84
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:08,083
You are a saint.

85
00:04:08,244 --> 00:04:09,750
Don't be an asshole.

86
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,140
I'm serious.

87
00:04:11,868 --> 00:04:13,274
Yeah, I can tell.

88
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:16,432
Lowell, did you replace
this main shaft?

89
00:04:16,552 --> 00:04:18,427
I was talking to April Hobart.

90
00:04:19,616 --> 00:04:21,803
What do you think about
letting Kyle come tomorrow?

91
00:04:21,923 --> 00:04:23,127
I don't think about it.

92
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:25,933
Opie went to prison because
of that asshole. He's excommunicated.

93
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:27,403
It's not for Kyle.

94
00:04:27,612 --> 00:04:30,203
April stayed in Charming
when you stripped his patch.

95
00:04:30,323 --> 00:04:31,244
Divorced him.

96
00:04:31,364 --> 00:04:34,023
She divorced him 'cause he was nailing
everything with two sets of lips.

97
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:35,365
The answer is no.

98
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:37,432
His kid's band is playing
tomorrow night.

99
00:04:37,552 --> 00:04:39,121
His father has never seen him play.

100
00:04:39,241 --> 00:04:41,433
- It's for April's kids.
- Jesus.

101
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:46,473
I guess I was just feeling
charitable.

102
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:51,251
Thought maybe you'd like the opportunity
to do the same thing.

103
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:54,219
I'm very charitable.

104
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:56,398
I know, darling.

105
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,470
You know what, I'll put it up
for a vote. But it's not going to pass.

106
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:02,733
I love you.

107
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:05,911
That love's going to kill me.

108
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:09,691
"As I ride along,
I hear a great sound.

109
00:05:10,513 --> 00:05:11,762
"What could it be?

110
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:13,258
"What could it be?

111
00:05:13,803 --> 00:05:15,453
"It's a merry-go-round."

112
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,123
I'm sorry, little man.

113
00:05:18,243 --> 00:05:20,281
I'm not as good at this as Grandma.

114
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:39,592
Can I help you?

115
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:43,049
It's a beautiful boy.

116
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:45,590
Thanks.

117
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:58,923
Chuck's been cooking
the books for the Asian mob.

118
00:05:59,043 --> 00:06:01,922
Skimmed 400 K off
of Henry Lin's crew.

119
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:05,706
Otto kept him safe up at Stockton,
but he gets out tomorrow morning.

120
00:06:05,826 --> 00:06:07,251
So we protect him,

121
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,331
we pick up the cash,
we get him out of Cali.

122
00:06:10,927 --> 00:06:13,058
We're going to split the cash
with Chucky boy.

123
00:06:13,178 --> 00:06:14,940
25% goes to us.

124
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:17,394
Otto wants his 25 to go to Luann.

125
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:19,256
Ain't gonna be a cakewalk.

126
00:06:19,428 --> 00:06:20,978
Lin's a dangerous cat.

127
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,039
Sneaky little bastard.

128
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:25,262
That's why we're going
to work three-man shifts.

129
00:06:25,424 --> 00:06:28,560
We will keep this place locked down.
Chuck never leaves the clubhouse.

130
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,893
And the garage is open
for pick-ups only.

131
00:06:31,054 --> 00:06:34,311
Skim's hidden in one of the restaurants
Lin uses as a front.

132
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:36,557
We're going to keep Chuck here
until Sunday.

133
00:06:36,677 --> 00:06:39,193
Go pick up the money
when the place is closed.

134
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:40,368
Good, good.

135
00:06:41,115 --> 00:06:42,822
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

136
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:44,634
There's one more thing.

137
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:49,105
April Hobart wants to know if her
old man can come to the fund-raiser,

138
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:50,963
see his kid's band play.

139
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:53,865
- You got to be kidding.
- That's done, brother.

140
00:06:53,985 --> 00:06:55,918
- That's done.
- No, I know, but...

141
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:58,434
You know,
she took a big hit staying behind.

142
00:06:58,554 --> 00:06:59,922
She supported the club.

143
00:07:00,283 --> 00:07:02,021
It's for her, not Kyle.

144
00:07:02,803 --> 00:07:04,551
I figured I'd throw it up
for a vote.

145
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,179
Let him come.

146
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:11,960
- Are you serious?
- This can't be about getting even.

147
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,699
- Not at the school.
- It's not about that.

148
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:18,190
The guy's got nothing, right?
No club, no family.

149
00:07:19,678 --> 00:07:22,319
Do me good to see that.
Appreciate what I got.

150
00:07:26,428 --> 00:07:28,084
- Anybody opposed?
- Yeah, me.

151
00:07:28,204 --> 00:07:29,743
I don't agree with it.

152
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:31,578
This is wrong, man.

153
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:35,416
Majority rule.

154
00:07:35,578 --> 00:07:37,209
Vote passes. Let him come.

155
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:40,497
You all better be
at that fund-raiser tomorrow,

156
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:42,810
unless you want a size-nine
high heel boot up your ass.

157
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,837
- You coming?
- I'd rather have my balls cut off.

158
00:07:45,957 --> 00:07:47,058
Jesus Christ.

159
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:49,306
What, too soon for that joke?

160
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,256
Watch Kyle tomorrow, right?

161
00:07:52,376 --> 00:07:54,373
I don't want anything going down
at Gemma's gig.

162
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:56,729
- Keep him away from Ope.
- All right.

163
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:35,509
- You Chuck?
- Yeah, yeah, thanks.

164
00:08:39,992 --> 00:08:41,242
Thank you, guys.

165
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:44,171
I'm really, really in your debt.

166
00:08:44,995 --> 00:08:48,345
You got no idea how much
I appreciate you helping me out.

167
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:29,932
Episode 105: Giving Back

168
00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:47,793
You should put on your sunblock.

169
00:09:47,913 --> 00:09:49,824
- You know how you burn.
- I did.

170
00:09:49,944 --> 00:09:51,634
What's up, buttercup?

171
00:09:52,524 --> 00:09:54,103
- Hey, Charlie boy.
- Hey, Dad.

172
00:09:54,223 --> 00:09:55,307
How's it going?

173
00:09:57,312 --> 00:09:59,842
I can't believe you brought her here.
Kyle, this is about the kids.

174
00:09:59,962 --> 00:10:02,313
Relax. She just wanted
to hear Charlie play, okay?

175
00:10:02,474 --> 00:10:05,154
Yeah, that makes sense.
She's just about the same age.

176
00:10:05,274 --> 00:10:06,274
Funny.

177
00:10:07,463 --> 00:10:08,913
This was a bad idea.

178
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:15,535
Check in with Gemma.

179
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,179
There you go. Okay.

180
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:30,444
Shit!

181
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:33,549
You are late, Elvis.

182
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:36,885
Do you have any idea how difficult
it is to get this into a helmet?

183
00:10:37,005 --> 00:10:40,020
- The kids are waiting.
- I know, I know, I know.

184
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,301
Bless my soul.

185
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,314
Look at all God's children.

186
00:10:45,524 --> 00:10:46,524
So tell me,

187
00:10:46,902 --> 00:10:49,936
- who wants to look like Elvis?
- Me! Me! Me!

188
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:06,461
Isn't that guy Sam Crow?

189
00:11:07,705 --> 00:11:08,821
Not anymore.

190
00:11:10,151 --> 00:11:11,151
He got out?

191
00:11:11,812 --> 00:11:13,884
Sort of. Why don't you take the kids?
I'll catch up.

192
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:17,492
Come on, babies.

193
00:11:19,676 --> 00:11:20,709
Harry!

194
00:11:21,836 --> 00:11:23,820
- How you doing, doll?
- Hi.

195
00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:30,862
- She know about Kyle?
- No.

196
00:11:37,174 --> 00:11:39,593
Kyle looks like
he's doing all right.

197
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,433
Go hang with your family.

198
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,143
Give us a minute, baby, all right?

199
00:11:58,016 --> 00:11:59,873
No need to say anything.
I know my boundaries.

200
00:11:59,993 --> 00:12:01,515
I'm gonna tell you anyway.

201
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:03,844
You stay away from everyone.

202
00:12:03,964 --> 00:12:05,838
The kid's done playing,
you and your teenager

203
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,065
climb in your pretty little cage
and drive away.

204
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:12,476
Jax, wait.

205
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:15,822
I have something

206
00:12:16,263 --> 00:12:17,422
for the club.

207
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:19,632
This thing fell into my lap, man.

208
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:21,597
I'm making stupid money
funneling stolen parts

209
00:12:21,717 --> 00:12:23,367
at my gig over at Sparks Brothers.

210
00:12:23,487 --> 00:12:25,506
I want to hook you guys up.

211
00:12:26,034 --> 00:12:28,220
That's why you're here?
You're trying to buy us back?

212
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,299
Pull us into one of
your bullshit schemes?

213
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:33,088
Not bullshit, okay?
I want to share this with you guys.

214
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,290
Get out of my sight.

215
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,984
This is a really nice place.

216
00:12:53,104 --> 00:12:54,443
Thank you for having me.

217
00:12:55,095 --> 00:12:56,773
- Thanks.
- That's on the house, man.

218
00:12:56,893 --> 00:12:58,584
That's very nice of you.

219
00:13:00,343 --> 00:13:01,593
Excellent draft.

220
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:02,524
So,

221
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:05,412
you really got 400 thou
stashed away, huh, Chucky?

222
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:07,171
416 thou.

223
00:13:11,427 --> 00:13:12,427
Jesus.

224
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,345
Lin was real sloppy with his money.

225
00:13:15,465 --> 00:13:17,115
Arrogant wasteful prick.

226
00:13:17,585 --> 00:13:19,219
There's so much of it, too.

227
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:21,289
Counterfeiting, prostitution.

228
00:13:21,465 --> 00:13:23,532
So I cooked his books
for about a year.

229
00:13:23,652 --> 00:13:25,660
I skimmed a little hoping
he would fire me,

230
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,330
but nobody noticed
so I kept on skimming.

231
00:13:28,969 --> 00:13:31,897
- What'd you get busted for?
- Lin's lawyer finally caught on.

232
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:35,151
I got scared, so I blew the whistle.
I cut a deal.

233
00:13:35,526 --> 00:13:37,442
So you're a thief and a rat.

234
00:13:38,138 --> 00:13:39,298
I accept that.

235
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:44,536
The hand on the dick,
what's the deal?

236
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:48,664
I'm sorry, man.

237
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,835
I'm sorry. Sorry. I have this condition.
I'm not even aware of it.

238
00:13:52,996 --> 00:13:54,839
- Condition?
- CMD.

239
00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:59,055
Compulsive Masturbation Disorder.

240
00:14:01,764 --> 00:14:03,536
I couldn't get the right meds
in Stockton,

241
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:06,306
so it's a little out of control
right now.

242
00:14:06,777 --> 00:14:10,404
You know, I used to have that,
and then I turned 13.

243
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,819
It's a lot more common
than you think.

244
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:16,770
Shit!

245
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,569
It stems from childhood trauma.

246
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:20,696
- I was sexually abused.
- Hey, Chuck,

247
00:14:20,857 --> 00:14:22,595
I don't give a shit
about your trauma.

248
00:14:22,715 --> 00:14:24,661
If I see your hands dance
in your pants again,

249
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,661
I'm gonna tie you up and I'll throw you
in the goddamn closet.

250
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,098
Are we clear?

251
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:30,268
Accept that.

252
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:48,208
Can we talk?

253
00:14:55,843 --> 00:14:58,787
I just wanted to give you a heads up.
Let you know I'm in town.

254
00:14:58,907 --> 00:15:01,327
- I'm here on ATF business.
- What business?

255
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:03,238
It's an interstate weapons case.

256
00:15:04,841 --> 00:15:06,846
I shouldn't be telling you this.

257
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:08,955
Originated in South Chicago,

258
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,986
big arms deal led back here.

259
00:15:11,718 --> 00:15:13,668
Sons of Anarchy are involved.

260
00:15:14,472 --> 00:15:17,720
The rose petals and the sick photo,
that business, too?

261
00:15:19,531 --> 00:15:21,981
I just know
you really love pink roses.

262
00:15:23,313 --> 00:15:26,345
And I don't want to see you get hurt,
Tara, not by that guy.

263
00:15:26,507 --> 00:15:27,857
I'm not with him.

264
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:31,532
First love dies hard.

265
00:15:33,718 --> 00:15:35,691
That restraining order
is still in effect.

266
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:38,037
You come near my house
or you come to my work again,

267
00:15:38,157 --> 00:15:40,150
and I will file a police report.

268
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,748
Actually,

269
00:15:42,418 --> 00:15:45,990
my federal jurisdiction take precedence
over a state-ordered mandate.

270
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:49,041
But I understand how you feel.

271
00:15:50,161 --> 00:15:52,211
And I promise, no more contact.

272
00:15:56,094 --> 00:15:58,055
It's been good talking to you.

273
00:15:59,984 --> 00:16:01,089
I miss that.

274
00:16:21,478 --> 00:16:22,818
The King'd be so proud.

275
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:26,406
There you go.

276
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,782
Who's next?

277
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:44,840
Want to try the egg toss?

278
00:16:45,344 --> 00:16:47,194
I'm not so good at catching.

279
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:49,999
Me neither.

280
00:16:50,868 --> 00:16:52,970
Give it a shot, see how it goes?

281
00:17:03,144 --> 00:17:04,759
That's okay, sweetie.

282
00:17:05,534 --> 00:17:07,331
Go play with your friends.

283
00:17:12,173 --> 00:17:14,240
Got to get the fireworks ready.

284
00:17:21,653 --> 00:17:22,653
So,

285
00:17:23,062 --> 00:17:24,589
how are the guys handling Kyle?

286
00:17:24,749 --> 00:17:26,831
Nothing to handle.
Kyle's dead.

287
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:30,344
No, he's not dead to Opie.

288
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,891
You bow out of the egg toss?

289
00:17:42,164 --> 00:17:43,174
Yeah.

290
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:45,370
Yeah, I did.

291
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:51,032
I wanted the guy to be a miserable
broken piece of shit without Sam Crow.

292
00:17:53,944 --> 00:17:56,500
I tell you,
I'm having a hard time, man.

293
00:17:56,865 --> 00:17:57,886
Thanks.

294
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,932
You know,
this club means everything to me.

295
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:09,216
The only thing I ever wanted
from the time I went here.

296
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:12,056
And everything else:

297
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:13,503
Donna, the kids,

298
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,375
work.

299
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:20,084
I'm heading in the opposite direction.
I just can't hook shit up.

300
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:23,523
Feel like I'm missing
on every front.

301
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:26,723
I got no answers.

302
00:18:27,877 --> 00:18:30,904
My family plan is right
out of the Sid and Nancy handbook.

303
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,052
I'm so used to shit moving
in the other direction,

304
00:18:35,172 --> 00:18:38,229
I don't know what I'd do
if something actually hooked up.

305
00:18:41,952 --> 00:18:43,502
You think he's happy?

306
00:18:45,342 --> 00:18:46,563
I don't know.

307
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:49,683
Hold on. I don't want to get
any egg on you.

308
00:18:57,801 --> 00:18:59,266
He still has that tat.

309
00:18:59,427 --> 00:19:00,445
Yeah.

310
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:04,060
This is me.

311
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,108
So how's that new high
hat I bought you?

312
00:19:10,228 --> 00:19:11,978
It's great, Dad.
Thanks.

313
00:19:13,191 --> 00:19:15,893
Just grab the box.
I'll grab the heavy one.

314
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,164
I'll meet you outside, all right?
I'll get the rest of your stuff later.

315
00:19:23,189 --> 00:19:24,222
Okay, Dad.

316
00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:36,596
I been doing what Jax asked.
I'm staying clear of everyone.

317
00:19:36,997 --> 00:19:39,747
Think you and I need
to settle a few things.

318
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:42,465
Yeah, I guess we do.

319
00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:45,313
I wanted to come up to Chino
to try to explain what happened.

320
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,223
- But you didn't.
- Coming up on family day,

321
00:19:48,343 --> 00:19:51,110
it didn't feel right, taking time away
from Donna and the kids

322
00:19:58,986 --> 00:19:59,797
Stop.

323
00:20:05,148 --> 00:20:08,459
Little Harry looks like
he knows his way around a gun.

324
00:20:09,232 --> 00:20:10,411
I'm kidding.

325
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:16,590
Thanks for the crib money.
Any little bit helps right now.

326
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:19,598
Yeah, I get how rough
it is for you guys.

327
00:20:22,758 --> 00:20:25,805
I know you've always had trouble
wrapping your head around the M.C. life,

328
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,659
but Sam Crow is the only...

329
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:30,145
Your mom's already given me
the "Sam Crow is the glue," speech.

330
00:20:30,265 --> 00:20:32,151
I'm not talking about
you and Sam Crow.

331
00:20:32,449 --> 00:20:33,903
I'm talking about you and Ope.

332
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:36,703
What happens with me and Opie
is no one's business.

333
00:20:36,823 --> 00:20:39,275
You're wrong.
He's my best pal.

334
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,286
I love that guy more than anyone.

335
00:20:42,403 --> 00:20:46,325
But I also see what's happening to him,
and it scares the shit out of me.

336
00:20:46,727 --> 00:20:49,342
Opie can't be half in, half out.

337
00:20:49,747 --> 00:20:51,379
It'll get him killed, Donna.

338
00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:54,984
Then I want him out.

339
00:20:56,659 --> 00:20:58,929
That other guy got out... Kyle.

340
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:00,764
Kyle was kicked out.

341
00:21:00,924 --> 00:21:02,030
You know why?

342
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,741
'Cause the night Opie got arrested
for blowing up that truck yard,

343
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:06,853
Kyle was supposed to be
his getaway ride,

344
00:21:07,013 --> 00:21:09,354
only the asshole panicked
when he heard sirens.

345
00:21:09,474 --> 00:21:11,828
- Left Opie behind.
- Opie never said anything...

346
00:21:11,948 --> 00:21:13,764
'Cause Opie's not a rat.

347
00:21:15,634 --> 00:21:17,742
Brothers don't turn on each other.

348
00:21:18,222 --> 00:21:20,408
He did the time.
It's what we do.

349
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:25,275
Opie will never walk away
from the club.

350
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:26,915
We both know that.

351
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,998
He's like me.

352
00:21:30,662 --> 00:21:33,004
It's all we know.
It's in our DNA.

353
00:21:33,164 --> 00:21:35,548
If you keep pulling him
in the other direction...

354
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,385
We're not the glue, Donna, you are.

355
00:21:58,657 --> 00:22:00,907
- See you two have been talking.
- Yeah.

356
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:05,241
You seem to be doing all right.

357
00:22:05,361 --> 00:22:06,440
New truck,

358
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:09,633
nice piece of ass.

359
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:12,151
Yeah, I guess.

360
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,916
I miss it, man.

361
00:22:17,751 --> 00:22:19,084
I miss it all.

362
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:22,925
When I had that cut on,

363
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,895
everybody knew who I was.

364
00:22:27,085 --> 00:22:30,181
Even if I never met 'em, man,
I got instant respect.

365
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,681
Now I'm just like
every other shithead.

366
00:22:44,949 --> 00:22:47,578
You started telling me
something earlier.

367
00:22:47,698 --> 00:22:49,247
The stolen parts thing.

368
00:22:49,407 --> 00:22:51,727
Yeah, I'd love to bring it
to the club.

369
00:22:51,847 --> 00:22:53,855
Let you guys share in the pie.

370
00:22:54,455 --> 00:22:56,305
It's my way of saying sorry.

371
00:22:58,691 --> 00:23:00,358
We could run it by Clay.

372
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,908
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

373
00:23:03,723 --> 00:23:06,508
It's kind of a complicated time
for us right now, so...

374
00:23:06,628 --> 00:23:09,768
We should probably do it tonight
while you're still in town.

375
00:23:09,928 --> 00:23:11,458
Yeah, absolutely.

376
00:23:11,971 --> 00:23:13,821
What about your kid's band?

377
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,390
Hey, it's cool.

378
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,863
I can hear him some other time.

379
00:23:20,235 --> 00:23:21,208
All right.

380
00:23:24,523 --> 00:23:26,462
It's the plum-colored Volvo.

381
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:28,291
Okay.

382
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:36,962
Paperwork must be in the garage.

383
00:23:44,246 --> 00:23:46,471
Excuse me.
Have you seen Clay?

384
00:23:46,954 --> 00:23:48,932
- Yeah, he's looking for some paperwork.
- Okay.

385
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,060
Hello.

386
00:23:54,545 --> 00:23:55,814
Jesus Christ!

387
00:23:55,974 --> 00:23:57,554
- What...?
- I'm sorry.

388
00:23:57,674 --> 00:24:00,026
- Get the hell away from me!
- It's not sexual!

389
00:24:00,186 --> 00:24:02,823
- I'm not sick that way! Please...
- Get away!

390
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,110
- Freak!
- Please!

391
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,066
Chuck!
Jesus Christ!

392
00:24:25,241 --> 00:24:27,223
Step outside for five
goddamn minutes,

393
00:24:27,343 --> 00:24:29,534
- you can't watch him?
- I was just in the can.

394
00:24:29,654 --> 00:24:32,695
I was getting him the soft toilet paper.
He hates the scratchy kind.

395
00:24:32,815 --> 00:24:34,802
Well, I'm glad your ass
is feeling loved.

396
00:24:34,922 --> 00:24:37,647
Let's go, Chucky.
We're picking up the Chink money now.

397
00:24:38,828 --> 00:24:41,501
We can't go now. The restaurant's open.
Everybody's there.

398
00:24:41,621 --> 00:24:44,208
Yeah, everybody but us. I'm not sticking
around for two more days

399
00:24:44,328 --> 00:24:47,748
and watching your hand puppet show.
Get your stuff, now.

400
00:24:47,984 --> 00:24:50,031
- Is that wise...?
- Now!

401
00:24:51,561 --> 00:24:54,535
Blue Beemer camped out front.
It's the same one I saw at the prison.

402
00:24:54,655 --> 00:24:57,586
- Chinese?
- No, it's the hand job police.

403
00:24:58,451 --> 00:25:01,463
Call the guys. We got to do
this thing now. And it could get messy.

404
00:25:07,384 --> 00:25:10,254
- You seen Jax?
- He's with Ope. Why?

405
00:25:10,571 --> 00:25:14,134
- The boss wants us.
- You got two more hours in that booth.

406
00:25:14,254 --> 00:25:16,041
- Sorry, Mother.
- Come on.

407
00:25:17,555 --> 00:25:19,608
Jesus Christ.
Clay...

408
00:25:22,382 --> 00:25:24,399
It sucks being the boss, don't it?

409
00:25:25,417 --> 00:25:27,280
You know that fried shit's
gonna kill you.

410
00:25:27,686 --> 00:25:30,784
Yeah, 'cause the cancer's
keeping me fit and spunky.

411
00:25:51,862 --> 00:25:54,184
Hey, who's that guy
behind the grill?

412
00:25:58,138 --> 00:26:01,596
That's our new best friend...
Agent Kohn. ATF.

413
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,039
The fed looking into the club
is grilling sausages?

414
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:07,927
Must be part of his special
federal training.

415
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:10,431
Good chili.

416
00:26:18,935 --> 00:26:21,064
- Are we okay here?
- Yeah.

417
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,542
- What's up?
- We got to go.

418
00:26:23,662 --> 00:26:25,205
- The chow mein's ready.
- Now?

419
00:26:25,325 --> 00:26:26,125
Yep.

420
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:29,914
I'll catch you guys back
at the clubhouse.

421
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:35,984
- You gonna leave them alone?
- I'll tell you on the way.

422
00:26:37,821 --> 00:26:40,052
That's good wangler, pal. You win.

423
00:26:40,847 --> 00:26:42,523
Jax, who's it there?

424
00:26:43,424 --> 00:26:44,482
Look at him. **

425
00:26:46,202 --> 00:26:48,054
You tell Clay I'm pissed off.

426
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:51,740
Bad enough his sorry ass isn't here.
Now he's talking all my manpower.

427
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,021
- Who's that guy with the cops?
- That's your ATF guy.

428
00:26:55,224 --> 00:26:57,960
That guy was at the hospital
last night watching me with Abel.

429
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,781
- That's dangerous, brother.
- Shit.

430
00:27:01,456 --> 00:27:03,324
Well, you keep an eye on him.

431
00:27:03,444 --> 00:27:06,389
If he follows us out of here or leave
at any point, you give me a call.

432
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:08,181
- Pre-pay?
- Yeah.

433
00:27:16,045 --> 00:27:18,147
What's to stop them
from calling the cops?

434
00:27:18,267 --> 00:27:20,685
Trespassing, vandalism.

435
00:27:20,845 --> 00:27:22,493
I'm more worried they'll call Lin.

436
00:27:22,613 --> 00:27:25,249
None of them have
direct contact with him.

437
00:27:25,482 --> 00:27:28,224
- Is this really necessary?
- Yeah.

438
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:36,952
You sure this is the place?

439
00:27:37,112 --> 00:27:39,078
I did the books out
of the back office.

440
00:27:39,198 --> 00:27:41,748
Restaurants are
how they wash the money.

441
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:52,169
Our friends in the Beemer
shouldn't be far behind.

442
00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:53,483
We'll be ready.

443
00:27:57,502 --> 00:27:59,975
- Masturbater, masturbater!
- I accept that.

444
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,408
- Get out of my restaurant!
- You no work here.

445
00:28:02,528 --> 00:28:04,540
No eat... go right now!

446
00:28:04,995 --> 00:28:06,493
- Where?
- Kitchen.

447
00:28:10,353 --> 00:28:12,301
Hey, jerky-jerky man!

448
00:28:13,719 --> 00:28:15,567
The ceiling above the stove.

449
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,241
That square of new plastic.

450
00:28:18,586 --> 00:28:21,570
You get out of the kitchen!
You go now!

451
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:25,440
Used to be an exhaust fan.

452
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,477
I stuffed it in there
before they plastered it.

453
00:28:27,597 --> 00:28:29,383
Gonna need something heavy.

454
00:28:38,111 --> 00:28:39,161
I call cops!

455
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,434
You ruin my kitchen,
crazy knife man!

456
00:28:42,594 --> 00:28:44,955
Down the side vent to the left.

457
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,282
- Holy shit!
- Told you.

458
00:28:57,442 --> 00:28:58,436
I accept that.

459
00:28:58,556 --> 00:29:00,785
You pay for damage!
You go to jail!

460
00:29:01,099 --> 00:29:03,633
- All you crazy man...
- Shut up.

461
00:29:04,586 --> 00:29:06,625
I love jerky-jerkoff.

462
00:29:06,785 --> 00:29:08,251
You come back, okay?

463
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,443
Friends of the Beamer are here.
Another interested party.

464
00:29:13,563 --> 00:29:15,258
He's been taking laps
in a silver Caddy.

465
00:29:16,903 --> 00:29:19,142
- The shit is on.
- All right, let's move.

466
00:29:19,262 --> 00:29:21,056
- Jax drives.
- Crap.

467
00:29:39,442 --> 00:29:41,242
Shit. Hold on.

468
00:29:42,918 --> 00:29:44,788
Sunday would've been so much better.

469
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:51,555
Well, that didn't work.

470
00:29:58,884 --> 00:29:59,887
Shit!

471
00:30:06,845 --> 00:30:08,922
Shit. What's the plan here, Clay?

472
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:11,785
- All we want is the bag.
- Plates.

473
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,197
- Give us the bag, you can go.
- These are plates for a 20.

474
00:30:15,317 --> 00:30:18,166
- This shit's counterfeit?
- It's not shit. It's really good.

475
00:30:18,286 --> 00:30:20,615
- These bills'll pass anywhere.
- God damn.

476
00:30:20,775 --> 00:30:23,535
- This is your last chance.
- Hold up!

477
00:30:24,344 --> 00:30:25,165
Easy!

478
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,630
I think we can make a deal.

479
00:30:29,146 --> 00:30:30,542
I want to talk to Lin.

480
00:30:38,198 --> 00:30:39,706
There's your money.

481
00:30:40,628 --> 00:30:43,707
But I'm guessing that's not
what you're looking for.

482
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:47,133
- Where's the other plate?
- It's in the van.

483
00:30:47,782 --> 00:30:51,208
Look, we both got jerked around here.
Now, I need real cash.

484
00:30:51,328 --> 00:30:55,495
You need the cash-maker.
Hey. Cops'll be here in a heartbeat.

485
00:30:55,615 --> 00:30:57,319
I got the cops under control.

486
00:30:57,633 --> 00:30:59,279
- Ten grand.
- Hundred.

487
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:03,083
- 30.
- 60, and I'll throw in the door prize.

488
00:31:03,568 --> 00:31:04,429
Chuck?

489
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:07,014
- Was there ever any real skim money?
- No.

490
00:31:07,261 --> 00:31:08,700
- I'm sorry!
- Let's go.

491
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,835
I need a protection. I figured you guys
could still spend the money.

492
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:13,043
You know?

493
00:31:13,203 --> 00:31:14,761
- This was not our deal.
- Shut up.

494
00:31:14,881 --> 00:31:16,501
I want to talk to Otto.

495
00:31:18,157 --> 00:31:19,758
Pay Elvis and his friends.

496
00:31:19,918 --> 00:31:21,398
Get the other plate.

497
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,054
Guys, guys, really.
This is, this is a big mistake.

498
00:31:25,507 --> 00:31:28,491
You don't want to do this. Come on.
Really, you don't want to do this.

499
00:31:28,611 --> 00:31:32,261
Look, I had a deal with big Otto.
I kept my end of the bargain.

500
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:33,600
Pleasure.

501
00:31:34,557 --> 00:31:36,948
- See ya, Chucky.
- Clay. Please. Clay!

502
00:31:37,068 --> 00:31:40,256
Please! Clay! They're gonna
cut me up into little pieces!

503
00:31:40,376 --> 00:31:42,447
- I do not accept this!
- Put him in.

504
00:31:54,616 --> 00:31:57,700
- How'd it go with the Chinese?
- Not too good.

505
00:31:57,932 --> 00:32:00,531
- Well, where's Chucky?
- That's the up side.

506
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:02,670
Clay. It's good to see you, man.

507
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:09,076
So I hear you got an offer
I can't refuse.

508
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:10,834
Something like that.

509
00:32:10,954 --> 00:32:13,103
Well, I better get back
to do the fireworks,

510
00:32:13,263 --> 00:32:16,016
or your mom's gonna be stuffing
gunpowder up my ass.

511
00:32:16,136 --> 00:32:19,054
Yeah, I'm sure we're all on
Gemma's shit list by now.

512
00:32:19,174 --> 00:32:21,699
I live on that shit list.

513
00:32:22,313 --> 00:32:23,113
Ope.

514
00:32:27,795 --> 00:32:30,309
- You okay with this?
- Yeah.

515
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:32,039
You?

516
00:32:32,686 --> 00:32:33,649
I'm good.

517
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,836
Look, about what I was saying earlier...
doesn't mean I don't want this.

518
00:32:38,345 --> 00:32:39,257
I know.

519
00:32:41,111 --> 00:32:43,216
I'd rather be dead than be that guy.

520
00:32:44,261 --> 00:32:45,427
Yeah, me, too.

521
00:32:46,805 --> 00:32:48,001
We should get going.

522
00:32:48,121 --> 00:32:50,525
I can hear my mom
swearing from here.

523
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:05,353
- Do you know where Kyle is?
- No, I don't.

524
00:33:05,473 --> 00:33:08,617
Bimbo's here.
Truck's here. Can't find him.

525
00:33:08,777 --> 00:33:10,598
He was with Jax and Opie.

526
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:14,298
Well, it's about time.
There's Ope. I'll ask him.

527
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:35,977
Bobby!
You tell Kyle about the knucklehead?

528
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,158
Who got a knucklehead?

529
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,134
48 Mint.

530
00:33:40,408 --> 00:33:41,837
Bullshit.

531
00:33:42,277 --> 00:33:44,821
- It's so beautiful.
- It'll blind you.

532
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,924
- Where?
- Come on. Let's take a look at it.

533
00:33:47,044 --> 00:33:49,594
- You want to see it, all right?
- Yeah.

534
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,384
Yeah. Let's go!

535
00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:54,579
Right this way, mister.

536
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:58,315
- What you riding?
- I'm not riding anymore.

537
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,550
Okay, everybody,
listen up here and let's...

538
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,925
dig into those pockets and purses,
okay, and get those tickets out.

539
00:34:09,045 --> 00:34:11,156
Let's see if we can give away
a few prizes here.

540
00:34:11,276 --> 00:34:13,029
Here we go. Here we go.

541
00:34:14,342 --> 00:34:15,754
Now, when I call your number,

542
00:34:15,874 --> 00:34:18,033
take it over to the booth over there
and get your prize.

543
00:34:18,153 --> 00:34:20,203
First one's seven, nine,

544
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,107
three, six,

545
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:24,926
three, nine, nine,

546
00:34:25,046 --> 00:34:27,580
five, one, seven.

547
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,563
Where's the knuckle?

548
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:50,510
- What is this?
- Take your shirt off.

549
00:34:53,235 --> 00:34:55,385
- Come on, Jax.
- Take it off!

550
00:34:59,746 --> 00:35:01,076
Son of a bitch!

551
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,064
See that?

552
00:35:10,172 --> 00:35:11,677
I'm sorry.

553
00:35:13,276 --> 00:35:14,745
I'm sorry, Clay.

554
00:35:15,517 --> 00:35:18,565
I know I was supposed
to black it out and I tried, man.

555
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:21,835
But I went a bunch of times
and I couldn't...

556
00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:23,497
I couldn't do it.

557
00:35:27,854 --> 00:35:31,009
This is the only thing I have left, Jax.
Please, I'm sorry.

558
00:35:35,218 --> 00:35:36,476
Fire or knife?

559
00:35:40,725 --> 00:35:41,738
Answer him.

560
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,544
Jax...

561
00:35:56,993 --> 00:35:59,374
- Fire.
- All right.

562
00:37:02,744 --> 00:37:03,544
What?

563
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:06,603
Where is he?

564
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:10,025
You should head over to St. Thomas.

565
00:37:11,365 --> 00:37:12,652
I'll bring your kids home.

566
00:37:13,301 --> 00:37:16,648
- Jesus, what'd they do?
- I don't know anything else.

567
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:20,388
I'm sorry.

568
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:22,091
I'm sorry.

569
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:23,922
I love you, baby.
