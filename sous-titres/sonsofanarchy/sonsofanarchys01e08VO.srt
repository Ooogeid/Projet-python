1
00:01:16,698 --> 00:01:18,661
So where are we
at with McKeavy's cash?

2
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:22,366
Called in every marker we had.
Picked up another $40 grand.

3
00:01:22,486 --> 00:01:25,502
Bobby got that gig in Laughlin.
The owner fronted him the pay already.

4
00:01:25,622 --> 00:01:28,432
- Here's five grand more for the pot.
- We got 130.

5
00:01:28,552 --> 00:01:30,680
McKeavy heads back
to Ireland tomorrow.

6
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,763
And he's gonna need
his whole $200 K by tonight.

7
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:36,516
We got one more place left to go.

8
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:38,526
The porn queen.

9
00:01:38,646 --> 00:01:40,770
- Otto's old lady?
- Gemma says Luann's

10
00:01:41,053 --> 00:01:44,834
picking up two Gs a week
just from ad revenue from her website.

11
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:46,596
Yeah, factor in membership fees,

12
00:01:46,716 --> 00:01:48,679
downloads,
she's making three times that much.

13
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,697
You should let Gemma talk to Luann;
they're tight. Keep us clear of it.

14
00:01:51,858 --> 00:01:52,886
That makes sense.

15
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:56,357
All right, well, I'm going to
St. Thomas anyway. I'll talk to Mom.

16
00:01:56,477 --> 00:01:59,372
- Kid gets out of the toaster today.
- You get to hold your son.

17
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:04,169
- That's great, Jackie boy.
- Seriously.

18
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:07,448
At least we know one good
thing's gonna happen today?

19
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,578
Wait here.

20
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:35,706
- I thought we agreed to meet alone.
- My son, Esai.

21
00:02:36,034 --> 00:02:37,947
I don't travel far
from home without family.

22
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:40,177
I'll bet you got a lot of family.

23
00:02:40,506 --> 00:02:44,193
- What do you want?
- How's your beef going with the Niners?

24
00:02:44,313 --> 00:02:46,878
You guys making any ground
stepping on that heroin monopoly?

25
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:51,307
Sucks when the competion's
got all the big guns.

26
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:55,016
You make me drive 40 minutes
to shit-talk me, asshole?

27
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:57,834
No. Got something
you might find interesting.

28
00:02:59,043 --> 00:03:00,720
Hope it's your last will
and testament.

29
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,436
It's part of an ATF file
on the Sons.

30
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,608
How'd you like to take
over Sam Crow's gun business?

31
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,699
Niggers can't buy guns,
can't protect their heroin.

32
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:15,472
Mayans win out on two fronts.

33
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:17,408
Horse trade and gun running.

34
00:03:20,163 --> 00:03:22,048
Their Irish gun supplier.

35
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:25,914
This is legit?

36
00:03:26,034 --> 00:03:29,542
I also know when,
what and how the guns are coming in.

37
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:33,883
Everything you need to intercept and
renegotiate the distribution agreement.

38
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,845
- Where'd you get this?
- It's a going-away gift

39
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:38,889
from a disgruntled agent.

40
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:41,558
Enemy of an enemy
is a friend, right?

41
00:03:42,213 --> 00:03:43,726
So what do you say...

42
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:45,888
friend?

43
00:03:48,785 --> 00:03:49,858
What do you want?

44
00:03:51,226 --> 00:03:53,000
Same thing I always wanted:

45
00:03:54,095 --> 00:03:55,095
Charming.

46
00:03:57,236 --> 00:04:00,627
You kill Clay Morrow,
and while the chicken's running around

47
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:03,621
without a head, you hit the rest,
wipe out Sam Crow.

48
00:04:04,584 --> 00:04:05,584
That's it?

49
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,756
A simple little massacre?

50
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:10,561
You sucking your own pipe, grey boy?

51
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:13,754
Charming PD and the feds
have hit a wall with these bastards.

52
00:04:13,874 --> 00:04:16,163
They sent me this file for a reason.

53
00:04:16,898 --> 00:04:20,369
Now, do you really think they're gonna
give a shit about an outlaw bloodbath?

54
00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:23,975
They'll count the bodies, count
their blessings and close the case.

55
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,231
All right...

56
00:04:35,626 --> 00:04:36,766
Hey, hold it.

57
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,660
- It's not that simple, man.
- No, it is that simple, man.

58
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,279
You hit Clay first,
then you kill the rest.

59
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:48,077
I get Charming,
you get the gun intel.

60
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:51,044
Now what part of that
is confusing your little brown brain?

61
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:56,570
Do it quick before they catch on.

62
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:10,059
What'd he want?

63
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:13,393
Got to put down a couple of the dogs
making my life miserable.

64
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,277
Let me and my boys do it.

65
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,863
- You think you can handle that weight?
- Just tell me who.

66
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:21,479
Sam Crow boss.

67
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:25,829
And that greedy cracker shithead.

68
00:05:57,103 --> 00:06:00,982
Episode 108: The Pull.

69
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:20,459
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:21,526 --> 00:06:24,200
I didn't mean to go off
on you last night.

71
00:06:26,581 --> 00:06:27,887
I'm sorry, too.

72
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:31,019
It was a crazy day.

73
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:38,761
Strange time, Jax.

74
00:06:40,273 --> 00:06:42,066
So much shit is changing.

75
00:06:43,472 --> 00:06:44,818
I just worry...

76
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:47,905
about you, about him.

77
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:49,579
About Tara.

78
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,318
What happened with me and Tara,

79
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:56,985
- that's ancient history, Mom.
- She hurt this family,

80
00:06:57,563 --> 00:06:59,130
tried to pull you away.

81
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,707
- I didn't leave, did I?
- But she did. Roke your heart.

82
00:07:06,118 --> 00:07:07,347
I guess.

83
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:09,237
You guess?

84
00:07:09,717 --> 00:07:11,363
She crushed you, Jackson.

85
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:12,922
I was 19.

86
00:07:13,378 --> 00:07:16,408
It was first love bullshit.
I grew up, I got over it.

87
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:19,679
It's time you got over it, too.

88
00:07:20,011 --> 00:07:23,037
Somebody hurts your baby,
you never get over it.

89
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:30,286
Dr. Namid's still in surgery.

90
00:07:30,691 --> 00:07:33,038
Gonna be a while
before they take him out of there.

91
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:35,354
Yeah, I came early to talk to you.

92
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,512
We need a favor.

93
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:45,479
- Hey, baby. Is Abel out yet?
- No, not yet.

94
00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:48,012
- Appreciate you coming.
- I wouldn't miss it.

95
00:07:48,646 --> 00:07:50,027
Could we talk?

96
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,475
- I need to ask you a favor.
- Sure.

97
00:07:53,786 --> 00:07:54,840
What is it?

98
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,231
It's not for me, actually,
it's for the club.

99
00:08:01,572 --> 00:08:04,112
They need $70 grand cash
by the end of the day.

100
00:08:04,272 --> 00:08:05,518
What happened?

101
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:07,384
I don't know details.

102
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,119
You want me to front the money.

103
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,746
A loan. Yes.

104
00:08:17,253 --> 00:08:18,835
That's a lot of cash.

105
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:20,800
I don't know, Gemma.

106
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:24,006
I got a pretty good idea
what you bank account looks like.

107
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,089
What does that mean?

108
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:27,881
Come on.

109
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:30,012
Don't get all humble now.

110
00:08:30,332 --> 00:08:32,571
You're always bragging
about the business,

111
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:35,819
the money, the Corvette, new tits.

112
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:40,022
Here's a chance to use your cash
for something that matters.

113
00:08:40,306 --> 00:08:41,524
I paid my dues.

114
00:08:41,684 --> 00:08:45,236
Six years of taking two in the ass while
some teenager blew a load on my face.

115
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:47,221
I earned that producer's chair.

116
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:49,485
No one said you didn't earn it.

117
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:53,704
But Otto is the one
who fronted you the money,

118
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:57,352
pulled those dicks out of your ass
so you could put it in that chair.

119
00:08:57,472 --> 00:08:59,211
Don't you ever forget that.

120
00:09:03,987 --> 00:09:04,996
I could...

121
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:08,190
probably get my hands on 50,

122
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:10,088
maybe 55.

123
00:09:10,546 --> 00:09:13,370
That would really help.
Thank you.

124
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:16,300
20 percent.

125
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,146
What?

126
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,065
Interest.
It's business.

127
00:09:30,823 --> 00:09:33,179
You better rethink that percentage.

128
00:09:35,154 --> 00:09:37,297
Bad shit happens to greedy whores.

129
00:09:44,936 --> 00:09:46,099
Five percent.

130
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:47,715
Get it.

131
00:10:08,076 --> 00:10:09,076
Shit.

132
00:10:11,787 --> 00:10:13,949
- Come on, man, get up on the hood!
- Okay, man.

133
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:19,424
Shit!

134
00:10:23,428 --> 00:10:26,073
On three: one, two, three.

135
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:50,645
Darby runs his meth lab

136
00:10:50,765 --> 00:10:53,623
out of the diesel yard in Pope.
That's where all the mill drivers

137
00:10:53,743 --> 00:10:56,284
- score their crank.
- This is definitely Darby's shit.

138
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:59,514
This rock's been stepped on
so many times, it's barely a narcotic.

139
00:10:59,634 --> 00:11:03,291
See, Darby's making his move into
Charming dealing at that lumber mill.

140
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:06,711
Clay, we got to send this Nazi asshole
a clear message now.

141
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:10,631
Why don't we just go talk to the driver.
Ask him where he bought the meth.

142
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:14,966
Go.

143
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,390
How's McKeavy's cash piling up?

144
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,393
Luann came up with 55.
We need 15 more.

145
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,799
We've got six hours to find it.

146
00:11:26,731 --> 00:11:30,089
If you ever want
to own a top rocker prospect,

147
00:11:30,563 --> 00:11:32,611
then you better bring
15 grand to the table,

148
00:11:32,771 --> 00:11:34,715
sharpish.
You got me?

149
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:43,800
Darby's guys.

150
00:11:45,457 --> 00:11:46,620
Can't be good.

151
00:11:51,366 --> 00:11:52,363
Holy shit.

152
00:11:54,466 --> 00:11:55,466
Andy,

153
00:11:57,032 --> 00:11:58,220
who did this to you?

154
00:11:59,514 --> 00:12:00,472
Nords.

155
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:02,115
Why?

156
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:04,923
I was in way deep with Darby
on my crank debt...

157
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:07,938
$2,700.

158
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,732
Where you buying?

159
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:11,209
Up in Pope.

160
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:12,860
Not in Charming?

161
00:12:13,102 --> 00:12:15,018
Can't score shit in this town.

162
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,195
Anybody you want us to call...
family or friends?

163
00:12:18,315 --> 00:12:19,315
No.

164
00:12:19,582 --> 00:12:22,912
Oswald's going to fire my ass
when he finds that tanker empty, man.

165
00:12:25,351 --> 00:12:26,665
What are you talking about?

166
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:30,294
The Nords said that the diesel
was payment for my crank debt.

167
00:12:30,455 --> 00:12:33,256
So they came here
and they beat the shit out of me

168
00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:35,174
and then they took my keys.

169
00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:37,441
- It was a full tanker?
- Yep.

170
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:40,258
It's at the county impound
off the 18.

171
00:12:57,762 --> 00:13:00,038
Well, there goes our 15 grand.

172
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:14,535
- It's the goddamn SOA.
- Yeah. Here we go.

173
00:13:43,135 --> 00:13:44,716
What the hell, asshole?!

174
00:13:45,863 --> 00:13:48,385
- Easy, white boy.
- Put it on the ground.

175
00:14:05,021 --> 00:14:06,390
Dude, handle this for me.

176
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,767
- Where you going?
- To get my top rocker.

177
00:14:08,887 --> 00:14:09,708
Wha...?

178
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:15,167
No, you're not.

179
00:14:27,021 --> 00:14:28,195
Yes, you are.

180
00:14:37,805 --> 00:14:40,674
What the hell am I doing meeting
you out here in the middle of nowhere?

181
00:14:40,924 --> 00:14:42,301
Official police business.

182
00:14:43,955 --> 00:14:47,431
Darby is dealing meth
at the diesel yard up in Pope.

183
00:14:47,592 --> 00:14:50,600
And why would I give a shit
what happens in Pope?

184
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,665
I don't know. Just felt it was my civic
duty to share information on a crime.

185
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,482
You know,
set a good example and all.

186
00:14:58,456 --> 00:15:01,760
Sam Crow is a leader
in perpetuating civic reform.

187
00:15:09,104 --> 00:15:13,032
Why am I looking
at one of Oswald's tankers?

188
00:15:13,805 --> 00:15:15,543
Leads us to our next conversation.

189
00:15:15,703 --> 00:15:17,877
With the owner of Unser Trucking.

190
00:15:18,371 --> 00:15:20,548
It's 8,500 gallons of diesel.

191
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,174
It's yours for 20 K.

192
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:24,051
Stolen diesel.

193
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:27,054
Gas costs got
to be killing your bottom line.

194
00:15:27,214 --> 00:15:29,314
I'm offering you a 50% discount.

195
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:33,009
Half the cost, twice the risk.

196
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:35,644
Come on.
Fill your pumps after dark,

197
00:15:35,764 --> 00:15:38,259
and the uni finds the tanker
on the side of the road.

198
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:39,697
Insurance covers Oswald,

199
00:15:39,817 --> 00:15:43,730
and you run your trucks at a buck 90
a gallon for the next six weeks.

200
00:15:44,104 --> 00:15:45,655
Where's the risk in that?

201
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:50,585
Jesus Christ, can you at least
pretend I'm a cop sometimes?

202
00:15:51,113 --> 00:15:53,426
I'm gonna need that in cash.

203
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:59,626
- So you stole an ambulance?
- I had nothing to do with this.

204
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,333
Yeah.

205
00:16:02,453 --> 00:16:04,578
These things are worth,
like, 100 grand easy.

206
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:06,893
Yeah, they are. That's why the people
who buy them are,

207
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:09,374
- state and federal agencies and shit.
- Okay.

208
00:16:09,494 --> 00:16:13,287
So, what, you want me to sell
a stolen vehicle to the government?

209
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:17,514
No. Just...

210
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,101
sell it to, like,
a small hospital or something.

211
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:23,983
Like Uncle Freddy's Infirmary
or what?

212
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:26,843
Why don't you just steal,
like, a fire engine?

213
00:16:26,963 --> 00:16:29,021
And then we could have
our own rescue center.

214
00:16:29,141 --> 00:16:31,301
We could have our own
little uniforms and hats.

215
00:16:31,421 --> 00:16:32,369
Okay, I get it.

216
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:35,579
Just trying to, you know,
show a little initiative.

217
00:16:36,855 --> 00:16:39,960
Hey, Chibs, get rid of this thing
as soon as it gets dark.

218
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,105
You got it.

219
00:16:42,664 --> 00:16:43,839
What the hell is this?

220
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,904
- My prospect.
- Just, thinking outside the box.

221
00:16:47,024 --> 00:16:49,219
You get a chance to talk
to that tanker driver?

222
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:51,896
The Nords aren't dealing
at the mill.

223
00:16:52,016 --> 00:16:53,932
The driver bought
the crank up in Pope.

224
00:16:54,052 --> 00:16:56,477
It's where he filled
his tanker with diesel.

225
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,758
That I just sold to Unser.

226
00:17:00,706 --> 00:17:02,895
- We're flush for the Irish.
- No?

227
00:17:06,487 --> 00:17:07,696
My brother.

228
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:14,880
Einstein said that any intelligent fool
can make things bigger,

229
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,308
more complex and more violent,

230
00:17:18,574 --> 00:17:20,084
but it takes a touch of genius

231
00:17:20,245 --> 00:17:23,668
and lots of courage to move
something in the opposite direction.

232
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,947
I'm realizing
that my touch of genius

233
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:29,917
and my courage
are coming too little, too late.

234
00:17:30,254 --> 00:17:34,176
And I fear that for Sam Crow,
there may be no opposite direction.

235
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:39,891
Jackie boy, Clay's waiting.

236
00:17:40,265 --> 00:17:42,162
- Okay.
- Come on, kid.

237
00:17:51,908 --> 00:17:53,809
We're all set.
Devon just called.

238
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:56,137
The Irishman will meet you
in the bar in half an hour.

239
00:17:56,257 --> 00:17:58,706
- You'll need that.
- Yeah, I guess I will.

240
00:18:01,358 --> 00:18:02,878
I've been calling you on the cell.

241
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,087
They're taking Abel out of
the incubation chamber.

242
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:06,490
Shit.
Okay.

243
00:18:06,855 --> 00:18:08,472
Get your ass going, Dad.

244
00:18:10,428 --> 00:18:12,262
- Hey, baby.
- Plainclothes?

245
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:16,140
- Where you going?
- Meet an Irishman for a drink.

246
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:17,725
Well, be careful.

247
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,140
- Hey, Tig.
- Yeah, darlin'.

248
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,446
- Watch him.
- Absolutely.

249
00:18:39,478 --> 00:18:41,477
- Where's McKeavy?
- Don't know.

250
00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:43,292
His cousin's waiting for you.

251
00:18:44,215 --> 00:18:46,871
- You know this guy?
- He's with the Cause.

252
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:49,839
Doesn't come stateside much.
Must be important.

253
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:04,396
- Cammy Hayes. I'm Michael's cousin.
- Clay Morrow.

254
00:19:04,746 --> 00:19:06,705
- Tig.
- Have a seat please.

255
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,402
Where is he?

256
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:11,904
He's dead.

257
00:19:12,744 --> 00:19:14,507
Jesus.
How?

258
00:19:14,627 --> 00:19:17,022
The Oakland Port Commissioner
threatened to bust open a shipment

259
00:19:17,142 --> 00:19:20,078
we got coming in on Monday.
Wants to triple his payoff money.

260
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:21,955
Hefner. The greedy prick.

261
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:24,563
He's been riding roughshod
over the ports for years.

262
00:19:24,683 --> 00:19:25,774
Michael was pissed.

263
00:19:25,894 --> 00:19:28,444
He went off on him
for changing the deal.

264
00:19:28,662 --> 00:19:30,466
Must have spooked Hefner.

265
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,424
Had his port goons jump Michael.

266
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,802
They beat him, broke his neck.

267
00:19:34,962 --> 00:19:36,360
Left him for dead.

268
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:38,262
Sorry.

269
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:40,662
That's awful shit, man.
Condolences.

270
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:42,324
Thank you.

271
00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:44,941
Anything we can do
to help with this?

272
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:46,976
No. No, it's personal.

273
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:49,373
I'll handle Mr. Hefner.

274
00:19:51,654 --> 00:19:53,779
Michael spoke very highly
of Sam Crow.

275
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:55,072
He trusted you.

276
00:19:55,232 --> 00:19:57,096
Hope to be able
to continue the relationship.

277
00:19:57,216 --> 00:19:59,942
That's why I'm here.
I'll be your new contact.

278
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:08,148
No disrespect... I'm sure everything
you're saying is the truth...

279
00:20:08,268 --> 00:20:11,632
No, no. Wish we had a secret handshake,
a business card.

280
00:20:26,153 --> 00:20:28,879
That's the package there
that we're delivering to McKeavy.

281
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:31,650
Two months
and a month insurance... 200 K.

282
00:20:32,011 --> 00:20:35,330
- Mind if I take a quick count?
- I got all night, brother.

283
00:20:36,787 --> 00:20:38,167
Thank you.

284
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:10,898
I don't know
how to break this to you, kid,

285
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:13,384
but I'm your old man.

286
00:21:33,413 --> 00:21:36,882
Are you kidding me?
These guys are a joke.

287
00:21:40,221 --> 00:21:41,450
Is it just me?

288
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:44,654
***Or are they horrible?***

289
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:02,032
Lovely.

290
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,857
This'll float the Cause.
Keep Sam Crow and us in business.

291
00:22:05,977 --> 00:22:08,656
- Glad we could work it out, Clay.
- Me, too, Cameron.

292
00:22:08,776 --> 00:22:10,612
How is the Cause going?

293
00:22:11,042 --> 00:22:13,251
Like any good war, slow and steady.

294
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:14,836
Michael McKeavey,

295
00:22:15,622 --> 00:22:16,964
good soldier, good friend.

296
00:22:17,246 --> 00:22:19,769
To a unified Ireland.
It'll never happen through nonviolence.

297
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:20,894
Hear, hear.

298
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:23,322
What the hell you guys want?

299
00:22:46,775 --> 00:22:48,039
Watch my back!

300
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,012
Yo, we get it. ***

301
00:22:56,705 --> 00:22:59,715
- What's the matter, man?!
- I'm not sure this is the right dude.

302
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:03,480
Goddamn, it's gotta be!
We gotta split, dawg! Let's go! 

303
00:23:12,262 --> 00:23:15,062
- Clay, you okay?
- Yeah, Damn it.

304
00:23:18,288 --> 00:23:19,288
Shit!

305
00:23:22,491 --> 00:23:24,378
Cameron, that's bad.
We gotta get you to an ER.

306
00:23:24,498 --> 00:23:28,160
I'm wanted on four continents.
I can't just check into a hospital.

307
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,068
- Call the guys.
- Lock the doors. Get some rags. 

308
00:23:31,188 --> 00:23:33,910
We need to apply
some pressure to these wounds.

309
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,814
Mayans, man.

310
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:42,966
I guess it's on.

311
00:23:43,624 --> 00:23:46,094
And this war ain't gonna
be slow and steady.

312
00:23:55,886 --> 00:23:57,588
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah,

313
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:01,684
- I can't track down Gemma, though.
- She's at the hospital with the kid.

314
00:24:01,989 --> 00:24:04,141
- Okay, good.
- Where's McKeavey?

315
00:24:04,438 --> 00:24:05,487
He's dead.

316
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:07,655
Port Commissioner
had him beat to death.

317
00:24:07,775 --> 00:24:10,492
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
- We'll get rid of the Mexicans.

318
00:24:10,612 --> 00:24:12,843
All right, we'll take care of Cammy.
He's hurt real bad.

319
00:24:12,963 --> 00:24:15,358
We got to get him back
to the clubhouse somehow.

320
00:24:15,478 --> 00:24:16,628
Not a problem.

321
00:24:22,832 --> 00:24:24,633
Uncle Freddy's Infirmary
at your service.

322
00:24:24,793 --> 00:24:25,830
In you go.

323
00:24:29,422 --> 00:24:30,994
Those slugs are deep.

324
00:24:33,802 --> 00:24:35,446
What the hell you're doing,
Scotsman?

325
00:24:36,263 --> 00:24:40,107
Five months in Her Majesty's
armed forces as a medic.

326
00:24:40,267 --> 00:24:42,734
- Five months?
- Till I was court-martialed.

327
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:43,969
Great.

328
00:24:44,257 --> 00:24:47,322
You think this hit was just about us,
or us and the Irishman?

329
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:48,805
I don't know.

330
00:24:48,925 --> 00:24:50,575
How would Alvarez know
about the Irish?

331
00:24:51,206 --> 00:24:52,412
Darby, man.

332
00:24:53,193 --> 00:24:54,358
It was Darby.

333
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:56,922
The Nords and the Mayans
have joined forces.

334
00:24:57,042 --> 00:24:59,543
I saw it happening weeks ago
when we blew up that warehouse.

335
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,075
I told you
we should have handled it then.

336
00:25:02,195 --> 00:25:04,163
This is Bloody Sunday, brother.

337
00:25:04,446 --> 00:25:07,517
We got to call in
all the Sons, all of 'em.

338
00:25:07,637 --> 00:25:09,886
Kill this Cracker-Wetback alliance
now.

339
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,787
Tig's right.

340
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,717
Need bodies, need guns.

341
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,813
You with us here?

342
00:25:20,325 --> 00:25:21,815
We're not ready for war.

343
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:25,123
We got no cash,
we got no weapon surplus,

344
00:25:25,243 --> 00:25:28,196
- not to mention ATF's still in place.
- You can always find cash and weapons.

345
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:30,991
The question is
are you with us here?!

346
00:25:35,161 --> 00:25:38,427
- Can you give us a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

347
00:25:42,993 --> 00:25:44,587
You think I'm distracted?

348
00:25:45,353 --> 00:25:48,190
- All this shit with my kid?
- I'm very concerned about your focus,

349
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,392
but I'm having serious doubts about
your level of commitment to this club.

350
00:25:51,512 --> 00:25:55,514
I risked my life for 15 grand today
'cause this club need it.

351
00:25:56,932 --> 00:25:59,689
My commitment hasn't changed.
And the damage

352
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:03,195
that happened to my family?
Yeah, I'm seeing things different.

353
00:26:04,178 --> 00:26:07,208
Big picture shit for me, this club.

354
00:26:08,156 --> 00:26:10,406
But I ain't afraid
to get bloody, Clay.

355
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:13,771
I'm just afraid all that blood's
gonna kill Sam Crow.

356
00:26:13,891 --> 00:26:16,692
Alvarez tried
to assassinate me today.

357
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:20,753
Right now this is only about blood.

358
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:25,725
And I'll worry about all that,
that big picture shit

359
00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:28,114
after this score gets settled!

360
00:26:34,389 --> 00:26:36,476
We even out this shit with Alvarez,
it's gonna trigger

361
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:40,209
a lot of SOA and Mayan beef.
I want you and Juice to get on the horn,

362
00:26:40,329 --> 00:26:42,590
all right?
Washington, Utah, Nevada,

363
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,295
I want the number one
and number two in Charming

364
00:26:45,415 --> 00:26:47,270
by the end of day tomorrow.

365
00:26:52,774 --> 00:26:55,055
Clay, I'm worried about this, okay?

366
00:26:55,175 --> 00:26:56,750
Jax is smart,

367
00:26:57,332 --> 00:26:59,651
and I appreciate his lead
on a lot of stuff,

368
00:26:59,771 --> 00:27:02,290
but where we gotta go now,
it ain't about being smart.

369
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:04,251
It's about killing shit.

370
00:27:05,951 --> 00:27:07,345
- I know.
- No.

371
00:27:08,257 --> 00:27:10,173
I mean, I don't trust him.

372
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,717
When push comes to blood, I don't.

373
00:27:12,877 --> 00:27:14,950
I don't think he's got the balls
to pull the trigger,

374
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,682
- you hear what I'm saying?
- I hear you!

375
00:27:18,843 --> 00:27:19,984
I hear you.

376
00:27:26,988 --> 00:27:29,189
The slug in his ass
may have hit an artery.

377
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:32,119
It's probably the only thing
that slowing down the blood loss.

378
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:35,272
The only way we're gonna save this guy
is if we get some surgical tools.

379
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:37,695
- Like what?
- Scalpels, clamps,

380
00:27:38,003 --> 00:27:40,120
sutures...
Needles. That kind of shit.

381
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,217
- What happened?
- Ask him.

382
00:27:52,074 --> 00:27:53,008
My God.

383
00:27:53,646 --> 00:27:55,511
I'm fine. I'm fine.

384
00:27:55,956 --> 00:27:57,595
I knew it.
Goddamn it,

385
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,027
I knew something bad was happening.

386
00:28:02,236 --> 00:28:04,978
Holy shit!
Where'd we get an ambulance?

387
00:28:05,972 --> 00:28:08,776
- Numbnuts stole it.
- We'll patch up the Irishman.

388
00:28:11,297 --> 00:28:13,512
All right, so
what do you need me to do?

389
00:28:13,632 --> 00:28:15,363
We're going to have
a full house tomorrow.

390
00:28:15,691 --> 00:28:18,118
Maybe you could prep that,
you know, food, booze.

391
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,621
Okay, I'll get the girls into it.

392
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,546
Man, I hate this shit.

393
00:28:30,305 --> 00:28:31,305
Love you.

394
00:28:32,302 --> 00:28:33,302
Love you.

395
00:28:38,113 --> 00:28:39,241
Be careful.

396
00:28:41,358 --> 00:28:43,471
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

397
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:51,858
Chibs, make a list
of the surgical shit you need.

398
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:54,944
- I'll call Tara, see if she can help.
- Okay, kid.

399
00:28:59,962 --> 00:29:02,012
I appreciate you helping us out.

400
00:29:02,743 --> 00:29:04,255
See what I have in my kit.

401
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,532
I couldn't take anything
from St. Thomas, they inventory.

402
00:29:07,652 --> 00:29:09,959
Yeah, of course.
Whatever you have's fine.

403
00:29:11,384 --> 00:29:13,454
Here's some of the things
that you need.

404
00:29:13,574 --> 00:29:15,131
Great. Thanks.

405
00:29:17,498 --> 00:29:21,111
I'm not sure what's going on, Jax,
but I hope it works out okay.

406
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:22,164
Yeah.

407
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:24,808
I'm sorry.

408
00:29:25,528 --> 00:29:26,528
For what?

409
00:29:30,438 --> 00:29:31,438
You know,

410
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,540
when I heard you were back in town,
I ran the scenario

411
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,089
of how this would work, you and me.

412
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:40,433
What'd it look like?

413
00:29:41,421 --> 00:29:42,617
Like this.

414
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:45,040
You wondering what
kind of bad shit I was doing,

415
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,737
me saying I'm sorry.

416
00:29:49,148 --> 00:29:50,148
Yeah.

417
00:29:50,744 --> 00:29:53,506
Guess this conversation
feels familiar.

418
00:29:54,342 --> 00:29:56,391
Yeah, 'cause I'm the same guy

419
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:58,864
wearing the same cut.

420
00:30:00,505 --> 00:30:02,715
But you,
you're someone different, doc.

421
00:30:04,276 --> 00:30:05,666
That's a good thing.

422
00:30:09,692 --> 00:30:10,692
Tonight...

423
00:30:12,928 --> 00:30:14,907
I saw a father who loves his son.

424
00:30:15,027 --> 00:30:18,069
No fear of being vulnerable,
letting someone in.

425
00:30:18,727 --> 00:30:21,737
It might be the same cut,
but it's not the same guy.

426
00:30:26,073 --> 00:30:27,087
Good night.

427
00:30:50,897 --> 00:30:51,897
No!

428
00:31:03,882 --> 00:31:05,396
Good-bye, Mr. Crow.

429
00:31:09,012 --> 00:31:10,012
You okay?

430
00:31:11,331 --> 00:31:13,389
No screaming, you understand?

431
00:31:19,124 --> 00:31:20,678
You're hurting me.

432
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:22,604
I'm sorry.

433
00:31:24,595 --> 00:31:27,048
I'm sorry I had
to do it this way, Tara,

434
00:31:27,168 --> 00:31:30,070
but I just, I needed five minutes

435
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:33,405
- and I knew there was no other way.
- You're in a lot of trouble, Josh.

436
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:35,164
- Please, just leave.
- Five minutes.

437
00:31:35,284 --> 00:31:37,734
- I need five goddamn minutes!
- Okay!

438
00:31:39,146 --> 00:31:40,870
Sure, five minutes.

439
00:31:44,077 --> 00:31:45,661
Let's start over...

440
00:31:48,194 --> 00:31:49,194
Okay?

441
00:31:57,027 --> 00:31:59,472
Thank you for giving me this chance.

442
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,283
I know that my behavior
has been less than chivalrous,

443
00:32:03,403 --> 00:32:05,260
and I apologize for that.

444
00:32:05,502 --> 00:32:07,262
Sometimes love, passion,

445
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:09,639
inspires a man's baser instincts.

446
00:32:10,294 --> 00:32:12,183
He does things he's not proud of.

447
00:32:12,636 --> 00:32:14,434
I'm sorry for those things.

448
00:32:14,947 --> 00:32:17,105
I never meant to scare you, but

449
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:19,759
the restraining order... come on.

450
00:32:20,164 --> 00:32:21,603
That was so

451
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:23,002
out of the blue.

452
00:32:23,122 --> 00:32:25,946
And it made me feel
like some kind of psycho.

453
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:28,377
I'm sorry.

454
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:31,735
I heard you

455
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:34,038
talking to Teller out there.

456
00:32:35,713 --> 00:32:37,652
Sounded kind of intimate.

457
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:40,021
You and him...

458
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:43,354
that can never happen,
you know that.

459
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:45,789
You know that's all wrong,
don't you?

460
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:46,953
It's okay.

461
00:32:47,196 --> 00:32:48,846
Water under the bridge.

462
00:32:51,198 --> 00:32:52,896
All that matters...

463
00:32:53,516 --> 00:32:54,733
is this moment,

464
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:56,481
right now.

465
00:32:56,964 --> 00:32:58,373
You and me, Tara.

466
00:33:00,683 --> 00:33:01,900
We have...

467
00:33:02,609 --> 00:33:04,940
the chance to put it all
on the table,

468
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:09,171
work it out, build the foundation
that this relationship needs.

469
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,650
Yes.

470
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,150
Right.

471
00:33:13,904 --> 00:33:15,872
Why don't you...
why don't you start.

472
00:33:20,557 --> 00:33:21,557
Okay.

473
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,712
I guess I should talk about,

474
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:33,818
- what do you want me to...
- No. Sweetie,

475
00:33:34,332 --> 00:33:35,933
this is about what you want.

476
00:33:36,189 --> 00:33:38,839
This is your opportunity
to clear the air,

477
00:33:38,978 --> 00:33:40,928
tell me everything that you...

478
00:33:41,076 --> 00:33:42,816
think doesn't work
in our relationship.

479
00:33:42,936 --> 00:33:44,709
Be... straight with me,

480
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:46,110
brutally honest.

481
00:33:49,472 --> 00:33:50,628
Okay.

482
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,020
I guess, you know...

483
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,450
I was concerned.

484
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:02,156
Back in Chicago,

485
00:34:02,276 --> 00:34:04,214
you... you were very...

486
00:34:04,644 --> 00:34:06,194
- possessive.
- Yes.

487
00:34:06,374 --> 00:34:08,880
- That's true. Yes.
- And I...

488
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:11,164
- I got...
- Frightened.

489
00:34:11,722 --> 00:34:12,722
I know.

490
00:34:13,895 --> 00:34:16,379
Sometimes my energy can be very big.

491
00:34:16,499 --> 00:34:18,917
I'm an intense guy, and I own that.

492
00:34:19,037 --> 00:34:20,770
Yes, right.
I got frightened.

493
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,764
That's why I filed
the restraining order.

494
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:27,779
But you know now

495
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:31,364
that there was nothing
to be afraid of, right?

496
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,616
You just,

497
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:37,474
you weren't used to being loved...

498
00:34:39,116 --> 00:34:40,155
so deeply.

499
00:34:45,131 --> 00:34:46,803
Okay, relax...

500
00:34:48,702 --> 00:34:50,602
My little worry wart.

501
00:34:52,532 --> 00:34:55,538
Is there anything else you...
you need to tell me?

502
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,255
Get off your conscience?

503
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:03,458
Our baby?

504
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:07,119
You don't want to mention that?

505
00:35:08,183 --> 00:35:11,599
I... I had an abortion at six weeks.
It was never a baby.

506
00:35:11,857 --> 00:35:13,597
That's right, you...

507
00:35:14,327 --> 00:35:15,450
had an abortion.

508
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:18,453
Didn't bother to ask me
howI felt about it.

509
00:35:18,613 --> 00:35:21,195
- It was my baby, too.
- It was never a baby.

510
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,200
You never gave him a chance!

511
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:49,754
I know in my heart
this is the right thing.

512
00:35:51,229 --> 00:35:53,051
What I feel for you is...

513
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:55,280
it's deep.

514
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,400
It's...

515
00:35:57,413 --> 00:35:59,217
it's God-given.

516
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:06,083
This is our chance
for a fresh start, Tara.

517
00:36:06,806 --> 00:36:08,544
To do it right this time.

518
00:36:14,444 --> 00:36:18,093
Let me... let me give you that gift.

519
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,682
No, wait! Wait, Josh, wait!

520
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:23,045
Please...

521
00:36:23,768 --> 00:36:25,937
please...
Not this way.

522
00:36:26,241 --> 00:36:28,764
It's... it's a fresh start.

523
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,861
Make love to me.

524
00:36:34,021 --> 00:36:36,922
Gentle, like I know you can.

525
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,878
Please, baby.

526
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:42,820
I know you don't want to hurt me.

527
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:46,474
I know you don't.
I know you love me.

528
00:36:49,855 --> 00:36:51,024
I do love you.

529
00:36:53,364 --> 00:36:54,529
Then love me.

530
00:37:06,883 --> 00:37:07,854
I'm sorry.

531
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:11,023
I don't want to hurt you.

532
00:37:11,183 --> 00:37:15,069
I just, I'm in so much pain
when I think about you.

533
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:18,396
- Do you have any idea how this feels?
- I know,

534
00:37:19,724 --> 00:37:23,246
babe.
But I'm with you now, right?

535
00:37:24,624 --> 00:37:26,248
It's just you and me.

536
00:37:27,766 --> 00:37:29,676
Joshy and Tar-Tar.

537
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:32,811
Together.

538
00:37:56,384 --> 00:37:57,772
I love you so much.

539
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,021
God!

540
00:38:33,408 --> 00:38:35,151
You stupid bitch!

541
00:38:38,631 --> 00:38:41,242
Call an ambulance.
I'll bleed out.

542
00:38:44,308 --> 00:38:47,828
I'm sorry. Don't let me die.
Please don't let me die.

543
00:38:48,925 --> 00:38:50,289
Please?
I'm s...

544
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:52,342
I'm sorry.

545
00:39:10,365 --> 00:39:11,185
Holy shit!

546
00:39:11,345 --> 00:39:13,528
I couldn't stop him.
I tried to talk to h...

547
00:39:13,648 --> 00:39:15,498
It's okay.
It's all right.

548
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,671
- Where is he?
- The bedroom.

549
00:39:20,683 --> 00:39:21,833
Give me that.

550
00:39:29,147 --> 00:39:30,147
Shit.

551
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,664
You stupid bitch.

552
00:39:33,931 --> 00:39:35,978
I didn't know what to do.
I shot him, Jax.

553
00:39:36,098 --> 00:39:37,837
I had to.
What do I... what do I do?

554
00:39:37,957 --> 00:39:39,731
- What do we do?
- Okay.

555
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,258
We call this in.
You're not gonna get charged, he is.

556
00:39:43,588 --> 00:39:47,138
They're gonna patch him up,
he'll do a few years for assault.

557
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:50,131
Then he's gonna be out,
free to do this again.

558
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:53,269
No! He can't do this again, Jax!

559
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:55,736
- Please...
- Teller's your solution?

560
00:39:56,354 --> 00:39:58,107
You pathetic whore!

561
00:39:59,643 --> 00:40:01,593
Once a biker slut, always a...

562
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:47,803
- What have you...!
- It's okay.

563
00:40:49,438 --> 00:40:50,438
It's okay.
