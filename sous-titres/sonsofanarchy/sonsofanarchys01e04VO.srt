1
00:00:01,729 --> 00:00:03,732
Previously on Sons of Anarchy

2
00:00:03,852 --> 00:00:05,758
Found a box in the storage unit.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,970
It's like pictures and journals.

4
00:00:08,104 --> 00:00:10,888
- Things I never knew about him.
- When you and Dad hooked up,

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,849
he ever talk to you about his vision,
about what he wanted from the club?

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,726
Jax is going through some shit.

7
00:00:15,888 --> 00:00:18,298
He's asking me,
did he want to get into running guns?

8
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:21,476
Tonight he said that maybe
we shouldn't rebuild the factory.

9
00:00:21,596 --> 00:00:25,776
I just want to make sure he's following
in the right father's footsteps.

10
00:00:28,686 --> 00:00:31,464
Sam Crow's been in this town
since I was a kid.

11
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:33,202
My old man was a county judge.

12
00:00:33,587 --> 00:00:36,421
Saw some of the guys catch their due,
but for the most part,

13
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:39,024
Clay and the others keep slipping
through the legal cracks.

14
00:00:39,144 --> 00:00:41,019
Been chatting folks up
last couple of days.

15
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:43,856
Most of them got pretty quiet
when I ask about Sons of Anarchy.

16
00:00:43,976 --> 00:00:46,982
Clay's got some of the locals
convinced his brand of outlaw justice

17
00:00:47,102 --> 00:00:50,159
- keeps away the corporate bogeyman.
- I'd say he's right.

18
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:53,100
Franchise development
in Charming's pretty much nonexistent.

19
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,808
Been jonesing for a Starbucks
since I got here.

20
00:01:05,577 --> 00:01:08,135
Sam Crow isn't stonewalling
growth by themselves.

21
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:09,917
They're getting a lot of help,

22
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:12,487
some of it from inside
this department.

23
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:20,379
Got to bring it in through here.

24
00:01:20,499 --> 00:01:23,678
Afraid the amped-up carb's going
to throw too much heat on the line.

25
00:01:23,798 --> 00:01:24,735
Might.

26
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:28,241
That new Graytex cable can take
a shitload of heat, though.

27
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:29,611
We got troubles.

28
00:01:31,253 --> 00:01:34,236
Want to tell me what the fed's
doing in Charming?

29
00:01:36,474 --> 00:01:38,149
Showed up two days ago.

30
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:39,857
Chicago division.

31
00:01:40,524 --> 00:01:44,044
- Looking into Sam Crow.
- And I'm just finding out now?

32
00:01:47,186 --> 00:01:50,392
- How long is he going to be here?
- No idea.

33
00:01:50,934 --> 00:01:53,139
He's collecting intel, fact-finding.

34
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:55,284
Didn't go into too much detail.

35
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:57,786
I don't want you out rogueing
with this guy, you hear me?

36
00:01:57,948 --> 00:01:59,798
Stick to Charming business.

37
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,809
This fed wants anything,

38
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:03,292
he runs it through me.

39
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:04,543
Oh, of course.

40
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:07,359
You're the chief.

41
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,590
That's right.

42
00:02:10,315 --> 00:02:12,510
I'm the goddamn chief.

43
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,472
We've taken every precaution
to stay out of ATF's crosshairs.

44
00:02:16,634 --> 00:02:19,549
No busts,
no investigations for five years.

45
00:02:19,886 --> 00:02:22,512
- We don't know this guy's here for us.
- Hale flagged Bluebird

46
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:24,311
as our gun warehouse.

47
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:27,913
He's pissed off we made Unser crush
the case and he called in the feds.

48
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:30,567
- I think it's got to be about us.
- Be my guess.

49
00:02:30,687 --> 00:02:32,989
We got a garage full of 25-to-life.

50
00:02:33,149 --> 00:02:36,118
Any legit place we store those guns
is a straight line back to us.

51
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:39,037
Can't Rosen get us
some storage short-term?

52
00:02:39,198 --> 00:02:40,705
He's killing Bluebird, man.

53
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:42,956
He's setting up a dummy corp.
It takes a few weeks.

54
00:02:44,745 --> 00:02:46,835
We got that call
from Jury last week.

55
00:02:48,957 --> 00:02:51,491
Mayan's pressing the Devil's Tribe
to pay him vig,

56
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:54,218
to keep running book
and pussy out of Nevada.

57
00:02:55,572 --> 00:02:57,513
Look, maybe I do head
to Indian Hills.

58
00:02:57,843 --> 00:03:01,129
Offer Jury some advice,
he offers our AKs a safe house.

59
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,603
No, that's a risky run, brother.

60
00:03:03,764 --> 00:03:05,622
Knowing Nevada's Mayan territory.

61
00:03:05,742 --> 00:03:08,463
No, they're still looking to settle
a score from our little raid.

62
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,185
The Mayans know that
the Tribe's a brother club.

63
00:03:11,305 --> 00:03:13,904
Part of asking for that vig
is about shitting on us.

64
00:03:14,065 --> 00:03:15,518
They knew Jury would call.

65
00:03:15,638 --> 00:03:17,674
- Theywill be watching.
- That's what I'm saying.

66
00:03:17,794 --> 00:03:19,300
That's why just me and you go.

67
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,776
Under the radar.

68
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:22,913
We bring the guns in the same way.

69
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,367
And you think
you can bring Jury on board?

70
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:28,123
Shit, my dad saved his ass
in Tay Ninh.

71
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:30,312
He owes the Tellers a chit.

72
00:03:32,718 --> 00:03:34,993
Look, man,
we're not going to go cowboy.

73
00:03:35,113 --> 00:03:36,113
I promise.

74
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,716
Promise.

75
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,013
Low-profile.

76
00:03:40,174 --> 00:03:42,766
I don't want no wetbacks
knowing we crossed into NV.

77
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,360
They pull this off,

78
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,558
I want you and Juice
driving the barrels.

79
00:03:46,678 --> 00:03:49,128
Done. We'll need something big,
though.

80
00:03:49,248 --> 00:03:50,251
I'll call Unser.

81
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:38,442
- Give me a minute.
- Yeah, I'll find you.

82
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:45,223
Everything okay?

83
00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:49,145
I was hoping you could help
with the Cutlass.

84
00:04:49,265 --> 00:04:51,015
It's in pretty sad shape.

85
00:04:51,464 --> 00:04:52,464
Shit.

86
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:53,921
This is your dad's, right?

87
00:04:54,082 --> 00:04:56,506
It was in the garage
under two tons of old newspapers.

88
00:04:59,576 --> 00:05:01,309
Why don't you bring it in back.

89
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:03,659
- Have Lowell take a look at it.
- Okay.

90
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:04,772
Thanks.

91
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:08,212
I was hoping you could give me
a lift home.

92
00:05:08,332 --> 00:05:10,354
Actually, I'm just heading out
for a couple of days.

93
00:05:11,373 --> 00:05:12,366
Okay.

94
00:05:13,043 --> 00:05:16,093
Anything come up with the baby,
who should I call?

95
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,330
He's out of the woods, right?

96
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,600
Just in case of procedural stuff.

97
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:27,079
Just let my mom know
if you need anything.

98
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:30,081
Everything okay?

99
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:32,292
Yeah, fine.
She's just here to get her car fixed.

100
00:05:33,273 --> 00:05:36,547
- Could you give Tara a ride home?
- She's got to leave the Cutlass here.

101
00:05:36,707 --> 00:05:40,258
- That's okay. I'll just take a...
- Love to give the good doctor a lift.

102
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:45,372
- Where you going?
- Visit Uncle Jury.

103
00:05:46,094 --> 00:05:46,974
Nevada?

104
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,229
By yourself?

105
00:05:48,638 --> 00:05:49,638
With Bobby.

106
00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:53,989
- Does Clay know?
- Relax, Mom, it's going to be fine.

107
00:06:04,986 --> 00:06:06,907
You sent him into Nevada?

108
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:08,358
It was his idea.

109
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:10,046
It's club business.

110
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,746
He has a ten-day-old kid.
He's distracted.

111
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:15,055
- You have to protect him.
- Protect him?

112
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,890
- From what?
- Himself.

113
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,423
He's fine. Relax.

114
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:20,737
And this one.

115
00:06:20,857 --> 00:06:22,406
What's she doing here?

116
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:24,876
Anything she can
to get close to Jax.

117
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:28,083
Maybe she just needs a tune-up.

118
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:29,779
Didn't trust her then.

119
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:31,418
Don't trust her now.

120
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,333
- Hey.
- Hey, Gemma.

121
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:40,146
Back it up, prospect.
Come on. Back it up.

122
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:49,064
Lowell, my back tire needs air.

123
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,270
I gotta admit, Clay's old lady
gives me a serious MILF chubby.

124
00:07:01,397 --> 00:07:03,926
Hey, I brought that car
out of the garage.

125
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:05,416
It's clear now.

126
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:08,386
If you need me
to clean it out again, I can...

127
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:12,624
Clip a truck from Muntz's tonight.
Make it look like you stole it.

128
00:07:12,744 --> 00:07:14,694
Cancer boy wants deniability.

129
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:22,319
MILF chubby?

130
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,530
It's like a compliment,
you know, 'cause she's hot.

131
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,649
Stop.

132
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,338
What do we got?

133
00:07:42,682 --> 00:07:43,727
Mayans.

134
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,914
So much for low-profile.

135
00:08:43,603 --> 00:08:47,205
Episode 4: Patch Over

136
00:08:57,962 --> 00:08:59,112
Two on three?

137
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:25,603
Hey, Doc,

138
00:09:26,712 --> 00:09:28,104
got to sign these.

139
00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:44,911
Thanks a lot.

140
00:09:53,236 --> 00:09:54,486
Mind if I smoke?

141
00:09:55,634 --> 00:09:56,984
And if I said yes?

142
00:09:59,507 --> 00:10:00,529
Right.

143
00:10:03,071 --> 00:10:05,780
Must be strange being
in that house alone.

144
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,150
Everybody gone.

145
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:08,785
Hard to get lonely.

146
00:10:08,905 --> 00:10:10,855
My dad was a bit of a packrat.

147
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:13,615
Can barely turn around without
stepping on some piece of history.

148
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,860
Clay's the same way.

149
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:18,944
Never throws anything out.

150
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:22,365
Still has underwear from 1967.

151
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,313
Me, I hate clutter.

152
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,222
I get that.

153
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:29,840
Thanks.

154
00:10:31,985 --> 00:10:33,593
Want to tell me why you're carrying?

155
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:37,036
The gun in your bag.

156
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:40,183
You went through my bag?

157
00:10:40,344 --> 00:10:41,544
I spotted it.

158
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,549
I'm very observant.

159
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,534
I started carrying it
when I was in Chicago.

160
00:10:47,654 --> 00:10:49,704
I lived in a rough neighborhood.

161
00:10:49,824 --> 00:10:51,584
Haven't gotten around
to get rid of it yet.

162
00:10:51,704 --> 00:10:53,554
Beretta's not an old tampon.

163
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:56,859
You don't just forget
it's in your bag.

164
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:02,139
- Is it registered?
- I have a permit. It's legal.

165
00:11:02,843 --> 00:11:04,207
You know how to use it?

166
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:06,648
Yeah. I do.

167
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:17,342
Gimme the pre-pay.

168
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:27,704
So, Mayans spotted us.

169
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:30,203
Well, this forces our hand.

170
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:33,837
Can't risk bringing those AKs
in with the Mayans onto our visit.

171
00:11:33,957 --> 00:11:36,610
- We need a bigger presence.
- Why don't the Vegas boys head up?

172
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,117
Oh, no, I'm talking
about a permanent presence.

173
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:41,904
It'll be months before
the warehouse is up and running.

174
00:11:42,024 --> 00:11:43,788
Indian Hills could be really useful.

175
00:11:44,074 --> 00:11:45,724
You talking patch-over?

176
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:48,475
I don't know, Clay.

177
00:11:49,178 --> 00:11:51,263
Tribe might've started outlaw,
but now,

178
00:11:51,383 --> 00:11:53,427
I mean shit,
they're bookkeepers and bouncers.

179
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,231
They're earning outlaw-sized money.

180
00:11:55,351 --> 00:11:57,771
It's just a matter of time
before the Mayans push 'em out.

181
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,824
They need us
for their own protection.

182
00:11:59,944 --> 00:12:02,780
Jury was a real good friend
of my old man's, Clay.

183
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,326
I don't feel right,
slamming a patch, no warning.

184
00:12:05,446 --> 00:12:06,714
It's good for both clubs.

185
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:10,690
Now if you don't want to break it
to him, I'll tell him myself at church.

186
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,714
We're riding to Indian Hills.
Mandatory.

187
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:21,201
Patching over the tribe.

188
00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:23,799
- What, you serious?
- Do I look serious?

189
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:27,469
We're-we're short, I mean,
Chibs, he's up North with McKeavy.

190
00:12:28,378 --> 00:12:29,560
Anybody visiting?

191
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,162
Happy's down from Tacoma.
Doing an Autism Run.

192
00:12:32,282 --> 00:12:34,057
He's got Lorca, Bully, Donut,

193
00:12:34,177 --> 00:12:36,216
- couple prospects with him.
- Get 'em.

194
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38,346
Okay, well...

195
00:12:38,846 --> 00:12:41,570
Jury's got all that beautiful pussy,
man.

196
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,776
It's gonna be
a four-shot patch-over party.

197
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,846
Unfortunately,
you're driving the precious cargo.

198
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,753
No, no, Christ.
Clay, come on. You need me...

199
00:12:50,432 --> 00:12:53,191
Last time you had free range on pussy,
you throat-pumped two brownies,

200
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:55,416
your DNA almost brought us down.

201
00:12:55,873 --> 00:12:56,897
Besides,

202
00:12:57,136 --> 00:12:59,198
you're the only one
I can trust to handle this.

203
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:02,828
Come on. Hauling barrels?
Let the prospect go with Juice.

204
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:04,878
What prospect?

205
00:13:09,775 --> 00:13:10,820
Which one is it?

206
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,710
What are you an idiot?
Take the picture.

207
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:15,130
- Can't find the button. Sorry.
- Jesus.

208
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,766
Here, let me do it.

209
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,272
Holy shit. I...

210
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:20,678
- told him not to sit on your bike.
- That's all right.

211
00:13:22,197 --> 00:13:24,764
Look like a guy who knows
how to get his way.

212
00:13:25,623 --> 00:13:27,126
You do that to her lip?

213
00:13:27,246 --> 00:13:30,495
- Bitch has a mouth on her, you know?
- Sure, I get it.

214
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,315
- So you like Harleys, huh?
- Yeah, they look good,

215
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:36,068
but I'm way into the slant bikes
for their speed, you know.

216
00:13:36,228 --> 00:13:37,194
Right, right.

217
00:13:38,772 --> 00:13:39,772
All right.

218
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:41,791
- Say cheese.
- Cheese.

219
00:13:42,994 --> 00:13:43,977
Nice.

220
00:13:44,097 --> 00:13:45,309
That's before.

221
00:13:47,031 --> 00:13:47,996
Before?

222
00:13:50,784 --> 00:13:53,920
You don't ever sit
on another man's bike, asshole.

223
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,839
- Holy shit.
- Shut up, bitch!

224
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:01,649
Little respect for the fairer sex.

225
00:14:02,728 --> 00:14:03,961
That's after.

226
00:14:08,304 --> 00:14:10,754
- Where you headed?
- No place special.

227
00:14:11,014 --> 00:14:11,992
Me, too.

228
00:14:14,692 --> 00:14:15,685
I'm Suzi.

229
00:14:16,185 --> 00:14:17,143
I'm Jax.

230
00:14:34,547 --> 00:14:36,545
Just don't ask any questions, okay?

231
00:14:36,705 --> 00:14:38,649
I'll let 'em know you're with me.

232
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:46,592
You are the James T. Kirk
of the MC world.

233
00:14:46,712 --> 00:14:48,399
Going where no man has gone before.

234
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:51,499
Let me tell you, brother,
I think every man's gone there before.

235
00:14:51,619 --> 00:14:53,669
- Jackson Teller.
- Uncle Jury.

236
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:57,444
- You guys rember Bobby.
- Bobby.

237
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,609
- Needles, how you been?
- Bobby Elvis.

238
00:15:08,144 --> 00:15:10,243
MC royalty in the house, folks.

239
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,152
Jax Teller and Bobby Elvis
of the Sons.

240
00:15:14,272 --> 00:15:15,268
Welcome.

241
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:18,546
- Let's make 'em feel at home.
- Good to see you, man.

242
00:15:27,263 --> 00:15:29,412
We got 'em all shapes and sizes.

243
00:15:29,532 --> 00:15:32,969
I think I could be in love
with that perfect darkness.

244
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:36,728
Daytona,
come on over and say hi to Bobby.

245
00:15:38,777 --> 00:15:40,792
Daytona? As in 500?

246
00:15:41,437 --> 00:15:42,513
As in 1200.

247
00:15:43,283 --> 00:15:44,283
A night.

248
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:46,239
My treat, brother.

249
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:51,949
Show me the way.

250
00:15:58,954 --> 00:16:00,699
- That your old lady?
- Nah.

251
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:04,320
Picked her up at the border.
Little doe in the headlights.

252
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:08,589
Cherry.

253
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:11,015
This honey's with Jax.

254
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:13,978
- Show her the ropes, darling.
- Sure thing.

255
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,560
Come on, sweetheart.

256
00:16:21,798 --> 00:16:23,682
I'll see you in a couple of days.

257
00:16:23,802 --> 00:16:25,881
Call me. Let me know he's okay.

258
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:29,193
You know I'll drive out there.

259
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,398
- How embarrassing would that shit be?
- I'll call.

260
00:16:56,638 --> 00:17:00,009
Started the sports book
with the escorts and strip clubs.

261
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:01,993
First stop over the border.

262
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:04,788
Must be churning some serious cash.

263
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:07,669
You got the Mayans circling
for a percentage.

264
00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:09,427
They're jamming me up, Jax.

265
00:17:09,547 --> 00:17:12,897
If I don't pay the Mexicans,
turn my business inside out.

266
00:17:13,203 --> 00:17:15,153
If I kick up a vig up to 'em,

267
00:17:15,552 --> 00:17:17,102
I disrespect you guys.

268
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:22,209
- Tribe attracts a good membership.
- 18.

269
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,121
Real good boys.

270
00:17:24,898 --> 00:17:26,892
You still get along with local law?

271
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,266
Douglas County.

272
00:17:28,883 --> 00:17:31,334
- Sheriff likes the girls.
- Right.

273
00:17:32,172 --> 00:17:34,408
- How you doin', babe?
- I'm good.

274
00:17:34,528 --> 00:17:35,641
Hey, girls,

275
00:17:35,942 --> 00:17:37,431
the beers are warm.

276
00:17:40,234 --> 00:17:41,784
We just pulled those.

277
00:17:41,904 --> 00:17:43,679
I'll get those. Excuse me.

278
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,782
So, how we gonna handle the Mayans?

279
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,532
We're hoping actually maybe
you could help us out with a problem.

280
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,027
Sure.

281
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:56,554
Got a garage full of AK-47s.

282
00:17:56,906 --> 00:17:58,742
Need a place to assemble
and store 'em

283
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:00,412
till we find a buyer.

284
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:02,625
It's a temporary thing.

285
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:07,499
Got a strip club off out on 95.
Huge basement. Private.

286
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,325
Sounds perfect.

287
00:18:12,055 --> 00:18:13,263
Appreciate it.

288
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,570
You'll talk to Clay,

289
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,917
let me know
how to handle this Mayan thing.

290
00:18:17,037 --> 00:18:18,599
You can talk to him yourself.

291
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:20,518
He's on his way.

292
00:18:21,884 --> 00:18:23,188
Clay's comin' out?

293
00:18:23,628 --> 00:18:24,591
Yep.

294
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,901
- It's about the future, Jury.
- Future of what?

295
00:18:28,183 --> 00:18:29,183
The tribe.

296
00:18:29,614 --> 00:18:31,136
Jesus, Jax.

297
00:18:32,586 --> 00:18:33,574
Patch-over?

298
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:37,377
It's time, Jury.
This whole area is blowing up.

299
00:18:37,497 --> 00:18:40,995
We don't patch you over,
Mayans will run right through you.

300
00:18:41,978 --> 00:18:43,802
We get a foothold in Nevada.

301
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:46,873
You get status to protect
your business.

302
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,756
Best move for both clubs.

303
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,467
Lot of my guys aren't Sam Crow.

304
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,430
The ones that are cut out for it
will make it. Others will fall off.

305
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,932
I'm not a young man
anymore either, Jax.

306
00:18:59,092 --> 00:19:01,059
I don't know how much outlaw
I got left in me.

307
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:02,994
You'll do fine, Jury.

308
00:19:09,186 --> 00:19:11,367
Never throw
these guys any lip, okay?

309
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,451
I didn't. Just asked him a question.

310
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:15,221
Yeah, that's even worse.

311
00:19:16,337 --> 00:19:17,250
Where's Bobby?

312
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,161
- Out front.
- All right.

313
00:19:23,469 --> 00:19:26,627
So, how long you been his old lady?

314
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:29,786
- We just met.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

315
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:34,092
You better pay close attention
to what I do, baby girl.

316
00:19:35,648 --> 00:19:36,970
Whose old lady are you?

317
00:19:38,472 --> 00:19:39,586
No one's yet.

318
00:19:40,883 --> 00:19:44,837
But soon one of these guy will realize
what a fine old lady I'm gonna make.

319
00:19:44,957 --> 00:19:47,087
How long have you been doing it?

320
00:19:48,138 --> 00:19:49,483
It's about three years.

321
00:20:09,782 --> 00:20:11,571
You and Jury get into it?

322
00:20:14,449 --> 00:20:16,043
Didn't see it coming.

323
00:20:18,214 --> 00:20:22,105
I don't know if the old man's going
to be able to hang a reaper on his back.

324
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:27,463
This shit don't feel
good to me, Bobby.

325
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:32,878
Clay's making a mistake.
Tribe ain't SOA material.

326
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:38,076
You all right, brother?

327
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:41,410
Yeah.

328
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:44,848
- Why?
- Just checking in.

329
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:50,090
You've been through a lot of shit
in the last couple of weeks:

330
00:20:51,329 --> 00:20:52,931
baby, junkie...

331
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:57,775
Maybe all that noise in your head's
got you turned around a bit.

332
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,596
Noise in my head?

333
00:21:01,506 --> 00:21:03,807
You got something to say, man,
just say it.

334
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:08,880
You been second-guessing Clay
ever since your boy was born.

335
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,692
Club's picking up on it.

336
00:21:13,325 --> 00:21:15,277
You got to get right with that.

337
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,625
Next time this gavel slams down...

338
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:43,829
will be the last

339
00:21:45,028 --> 00:21:46,433
for the Devil's Tribe.

340
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:48,211
History between our clubs...

341
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:50,667
Jury and John Teller

342
00:21:51,013 --> 00:21:53,178
were in the same platoon in 'Nam.

343
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:56,777
Needles' brother's a 20-year member
of our Fresno charter.

344
00:21:58,023 --> 00:22:00,419
We have a deep respect
for each other.

345
00:22:01,691 --> 00:22:02,691
Now

346
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,161
it's time to become brothers.

347
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,498
I know some of you look forward
to wearing the reaper.

348
00:22:09,658 --> 00:22:11,416
Others of you are afraid of it.

349
00:22:11,576 --> 00:22:12,849
That's a choice

350
00:22:13,255 --> 00:22:14,920
each man will have to make.

351
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,094
From this point on,

352
00:22:22,814 --> 00:22:23,964
we're family.

353
00:22:24,436 --> 00:22:26,306
Indian Hills, Nevada charter

354
00:22:26,691 --> 00:22:27,954
Sons of Anarchy.

355
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:29,667
Congratulations.

356
00:22:33,348 --> 00:22:34,940
It is my personal hope

357
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,317
that every one of you
wears this cut.

358
00:22:38,835 --> 00:22:41,655
I know you got a lot to talk about.
I'll leave you to your business.

359
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,700
- Did you dose it?
- Triple dose.

360
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,425
Patch-over bash, man.

361
00:22:58,748 --> 00:23:01,560
Makes Mardi Gras
look like a sweet 16 party.

362
00:23:02,252 --> 00:23:04,644
With Jury's stable... shit.

363
00:23:04,963 --> 00:23:06,580
Nothing but young,

364
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:08,667
tight,

365
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:10,559
perfect pussy.

366
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,686
Well, Fido's having his own party.

367
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:22,946
- Which one?
- Unser said take the cargo truck.

368
00:23:23,066 --> 00:23:24,844
The keys should be in it.

369
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:29,192
Holy shit!
Run! Go! Go!

370
00:23:29,312 --> 00:23:30,604
- Shit!
- Run!

371
00:23:32,741 --> 00:23:33,707
Open the door!

372
00:23:40,525 --> 00:23:41,487
God!

373
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:43,297
Damn it!

374
00:23:43,605 --> 00:23:44,605
Shit!

375
00:23:45,772 --> 00:23:47,878
I thought you said
you drugged the meat.

376
00:23:47,998 --> 00:23:48,998
I did.

377
00:23:49,174 --> 00:23:51,130
Look at him.
He's foaming at the mouth.

378
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,064
That thing should be dead.
I dosed it with, like, two grams.

379
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,294
- Grams? Grams of what?
- Crank.

380
00:23:58,308 --> 00:24:00,950
You fed crystal
to a killer Doberman?

381
00:24:01,446 --> 00:24:02,861
Are you retarded?

382
00:24:04,065 --> 00:24:05,065
No.

383
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,325
Should I shoot him?

384
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:10,326
No.

385
00:24:10,613 --> 00:24:11,620
Drive.

386
00:24:12,263 --> 00:24:13,264
Put it in.

387
00:24:14,943 --> 00:24:16,208
Look at my ass.

388
00:24:47,475 --> 00:24:49,825
- Hey, darling. Do me a favor?
- Sure, babe.

389
00:24:50,124 --> 00:24:52,109
Guy distributes your stuff...

390
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,570
he still have access
to that federal marshal?

391
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,662
Think so. Been feeding his Pillsbury
dough girl fetish for years.

392
00:25:00,114 --> 00:25:01,461
What do you need?

393
00:25:03,614 --> 00:25:06,021
How do you think
this thing'll play out?

394
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,570
Half, maybe more will stay.

395
00:25:09,562 --> 00:25:13,015
And that pack'll thin out
once the Mayans come a-knocking.

396
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:15,641
Which will be real soon.

397
00:25:15,761 --> 00:25:18,669
You can't leave
these guys with no backup.

398
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:20,083
Vegas can hang.

399
00:25:20,203 --> 00:25:23,766
Indian Hills is gonna have to learn
how to protect their ground.

400
00:25:23,886 --> 00:25:25,738
Best way to thin out a herd.

401
00:25:26,213 --> 00:25:28,196
Herd's already pretty thin, Clay.

402
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:30,574
I want to be here for Jury
when the shit goes down.

403
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:33,743
I ain't worried about Jury;
he can handle himself.

404
00:25:37,126 --> 00:25:38,545
You believe that?

405
00:25:42,796 --> 00:25:44,754
Looks like the vote's in?

406
00:26:02,237 --> 00:26:03,106
We're in.

407
00:26:33,215 --> 00:26:34,643
Patch-over party!

408
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:44,693
What's a patch-over?

409
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:48,718
Means things are about to change.

410
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:12,577
I have a cousin in Iraq.

411
00:27:12,968 --> 00:27:16,547
He still have both his nuts,
but he's lost a couple buddies.

412
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:21,439
Yeah, you know, sometimes I feel
guilty I left after just one TOD.

413
00:27:22,178 --> 00:27:24,943
You shouldn't.
I mean, you're a hero.

414
00:27:28,977 --> 00:27:31,004
Can you still have kids or...?

415
00:27:33,121 --> 00:27:34,948
Yeah, lefty's real potent.

416
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,161
- You ever been to Ireland?
- Shut up.

417
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:56,548
Look, man, it's not my fault
that you got bit, all right?

418
00:27:56,668 --> 00:27:58,638
You didn't specify
what kind of drug.

419
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,726
I am not happy
about being here either.

420
00:28:02,886 --> 00:28:05,478
At least you and I, we can try
to have a decent conversation.

421
00:28:05,638 --> 00:28:07,647
What do you want?
You want to bond?

422
00:28:08,598 --> 00:28:10,025
You want to get closer?

423
00:28:10,185 --> 00:28:11,185
Fine.

424
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:16,441
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna dunk my balls in your mouth.

425
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:19,746
You're gonna gag, I'm gonna laugh,
we'll be best friends forever.

426
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:22,582
- Why do you got to be that way?
- You ever been to Attica?

427
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:23,702
Shut up.

428
00:28:25,862 --> 00:28:26,916
Pull your pants up.

429
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:31,241
You okay?

430
00:28:33,456 --> 00:28:34,771
Want something?

431
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,965
I could get used to this.

432
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,664
Let's just take it
a night at a time, babe.

433
00:29:05,716 --> 00:29:06,915
The brunette,

434
00:29:07,218 --> 00:29:08,903
she anybody's old lady?

435
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:11,807
No, Cherry's just a sweetbutt.

436
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:13,902
- Good girl.
- How good?

437
00:29:14,979 --> 00:29:16,633
What's mine is yours, brother.

438
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,675
Watch my stogie.

439
00:29:24,861 --> 00:29:26,937
- Can I cut in?
- Yeah, sure.

440
00:29:30,717 --> 00:29:31,717
Hi, baby.

441
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,105
Hi.

442
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,620
Come to Daddy.

443
00:29:45,598 --> 00:29:48,720
I got to admit this one
gives me a serious chubby.

444
00:30:05,238 --> 00:30:06,647
Look at this shit.

445
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:08,562
Hey, guys.

446
00:30:09,514 --> 00:30:10,437
Here we go.

447
00:30:33,743 --> 00:30:36,743
The first time I read Emma Goldman
wasn't in a book.

448
00:30:36,863 --> 00:30:40,366
I was 16,
hiking near the Nevada border.

449
00:30:40,783 --> 00:30:43,309
The quote was painted
on a wall in red.

450
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:48,766
When I saw those words,

451
00:30:48,926 --> 00:30:51,713
it was like someone ripped them
from the inside of my head.

452
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:53,271
"Anarchism

453
00:30:53,431 --> 00:30:56,159
"stands for liberation
of the human mind

454
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:57,984
"and the dominion of religion.

455
00:30:58,144 --> 00:31:01,779
"Liberation of the human body
from the dominion of property.

456
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,227
"Liberation from shackles

457
00:31:04,347 --> 00:31:06,075
"and the restraint of government.

458
00:31:06,914 --> 00:31:09,162
"It stands for social order

459
00:31:09,893 --> 00:31:12,671
"based on the free
grouping of individuals."

460
00:31:27,584 --> 00:31:30,667
The concept was pure, simple, true.

461
00:31:31,546 --> 00:31:34,594
It inspired me.
Lit a rebellious fire.

462
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,785
But ultimately, I learned the lesson
that Goldman, Proudhon

463
00:31:38,905 --> 00:31:40,387
and the others learned:

464
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:43,528
that true freedom
requires sacrifice and pain.

465
00:31:44,156 --> 00:31:46,765
Most human beings only think
they want freedom.

466
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:49,988
In truth, they yearn for the bondage
of social order,

467
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:51,935
rigid laws, materialism.

468
00:31:52,949 --> 00:31:55,183
The only freedom man really wants

469
00:31:55,303 --> 00:31:57,536
is the freedom to be comfortable.

470
00:32:01,043 --> 00:32:01,880
Man!

471
00:32:02,229 --> 00:32:03,284
I hate you.

472
00:32:07,917 --> 00:32:10,890
- What's up, killer?
- I hate all of you.

473
00:32:12,376 --> 00:32:14,535
- Morning, Cherry.
- Morning.

474
00:32:15,743 --> 00:32:18,510
You want some coffee?
Whip up some breakfast?

475
00:32:18,868 --> 00:32:19,868
Okay.

476
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:24,779
I thought you liked that guy.

477
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:26,241
I do.

478
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,935
Well, then why'd you sleep
with that old dude?

479
00:32:30,172 --> 00:32:31,724
'Cause that's what we do.

480
00:32:31,844 --> 00:32:34,803
You mean, you just sleep
with whoever they tell you to?

481
00:32:35,158 --> 00:32:39,043
I take care of them
and they take care of me. It's a family.

482
00:32:40,227 --> 00:32:41,654
And when I finally hook up,

483
00:32:41,774 --> 00:32:44,357
I'll belong to that guy
and that guy only.

484
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:47,155
See, good old ladies,

485
00:32:47,852 --> 00:32:49,847
they can make or break a club.

486
00:32:50,443 --> 00:32:51,431
Come here.

487
00:32:55,729 --> 00:32:57,570
- Hi.
- Car's ready.

488
00:32:58,138 --> 00:33:00,228
Figured you'd need it for work.

489
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:02,591
Yeah.
You drove it here?

490
00:33:03,969 --> 00:33:07,577
I'm thinking, me and you
got off to a bad start.

491
00:33:08,368 --> 00:33:10,218
It's my way of saying sorry.

492
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:13,675
That's nice of you.

493
00:33:13,795 --> 00:33:14,795
Thanks.

494
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:19,208
You weren't kidding
about the clutter.

495
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:21,809
Working through a room at a time.

496
00:33:25,585 --> 00:33:27,876
Your dad was real handsome.

497
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:31,130
Kinda nuts, but cute.

498
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,020
- Yeah. Why are you here, Gemma?
- Your car.

499
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,610
Yeah, the good Samaritan
bit's not really playing.

500
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,098
What do you want?

501
00:33:40,313 --> 00:33:42,352
You left Charming
because it was

502
00:33:42,472 --> 00:33:45,526
incestuous, backward,
and small-minded.

503
00:33:45,878 --> 00:33:47,844
It's pretty much an exact quote.

504
00:33:48,189 --> 00:33:49,344
I don't forget.

505
00:33:50,367 --> 00:33:52,784
You leave Chicago
to come back to this:

506
00:33:52,944 --> 00:33:57,071
shit-filled house, mediocre gig
at a community hospital?

507
00:33:57,782 --> 00:33:59,480
Needed to tie up family business.

508
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,620
People don't up-end their lives
to pack up a dead relative's house.

509
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,660
You seem to be spending a lot of time
and energy worrying about my life.

510
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:11,511
- Do I scare you that much, Gemma?
- I don't forget.

511
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,553
I'm not worried about you.

512
00:34:16,328 --> 00:34:18,482
Just the people you touch.

513
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:21,953
Jax is in a real strange place.

514
00:34:22,504 --> 00:34:25,605
He doesn't need any
outside voices in his head.

515
00:34:27,782 --> 00:34:29,195
Stay clear of him.

516
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,609
We're not 19 years old anymore.
You can't dictate what he does,

517
00:34:32,729 --> 00:34:34,909
- who he sees...
- I'm his mother.

518
00:34:35,069 --> 00:34:37,366
And until I am dead and cold,

519
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,146
I am gonna do anything
I have to do to protect him.

520
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,942
And, I'm not sure
why you're carrying a gun,

521
00:34:50,775 --> 00:34:52,878
but if you're gonna use one,

522
00:34:54,066 --> 00:34:55,698
make sure to be safe...

523
00:34:58,404 --> 00:34:59,863
No serial numbers.

524
00:35:12,414 --> 00:35:13,833
Any problems?

525
00:35:14,491 --> 00:35:16,117
Truck's out back.
It's all good.

526
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:18,577
He still pouting?

527
00:35:18,697 --> 00:35:21,456
Who, Tiggy?
Why don't you give him the sweetbutt?

528
00:35:21,616 --> 00:35:24,731
Nah, I'm good with Half-Sack.
That score's settled.

529
00:35:26,388 --> 00:35:28,703
- Where the hell are you?
- Yeah, looks like Jury's gonna have

530
00:35:28,823 --> 00:35:31,382
some backup
when the Mayan shit goes down.

531
00:35:31,542 --> 00:35:35,418
- What are you talking about?
- I'm on my way back and I'm not alone.

532
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:37,682
Shit! Mayans.

533
00:35:38,006 --> 00:35:40,177
- Where?
- Pack of 'em trailing Jax.

534
00:35:40,297 --> 00:35:42,185
- Get rid of the goddamned truck.
- Got it.

535
00:35:42,345 --> 00:35:45,980
- Mayans? What do you want to do?
- Weapons behind the bar.

536
00:35:49,082 --> 00:35:51,281
- You two should get out of here.
- What's going on?

537
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:52,408
Let's go out.

538
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:53,987
- Why?
- Just go.

539
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:30,273
- What can I do?
- Girls all gone?

540
00:36:31,477 --> 00:36:33,486
Open up the garage.
Move the bikes inside!

541
00:36:33,646 --> 00:36:35,071
Everybody got a weapon?

542
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,987
Go! Go!

543
00:38:02,418 --> 00:38:04,318
Jesus Christ!

544
00:38:08,535 --> 00:38:10,235
Moby's doing good.

545
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:13,272
He likes school.
Yeah, he likes to draw a lot.

546
00:38:14,137 --> 00:38:16,172
I don't see his mom too much, but...

547
00:38:17,126 --> 00:38:20,855
Hey, I'm real happy
that Jax's kid's gonna be okay.

548
00:38:21,547 --> 00:38:22,946
That's a blessing.

549
00:38:24,383 --> 00:38:27,733
What happened to Wendy
should be a lesson to you, Lowell.

550
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:29,579
It is.

551
00:38:30,473 --> 00:38:31,649
And I know.

552
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:35,316
I've been doing real good
with all that, Gemma.

553
00:38:35,476 --> 00:38:36,812
You can ask Clay.

554
00:38:38,312 --> 00:38:39,312
Good.

555
00:38:46,561 --> 00:38:47,914
- Hey.
- Any luck?

556
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,719
Nothing really flagged.

557
00:38:50,001 --> 00:38:52,058
No outstanding warrants.

558
00:38:52,509 --> 00:38:55,073
She had a restraing order
a few months back.

559
00:38:55,362 --> 00:38:57,764
- Against her?
- No, she filed it.

560
00:38:57,884 --> 00:39:00,746
My guy said the name
was omitted from the report.

561
00:39:02,234 --> 00:39:04,316
What kind of neighborhood
she live in?

562
00:39:04,436 --> 00:39:06,773
Old Town.
Pretty nice, I think.

563
00:39:09,651 --> 00:39:12,301
You really don't trust
this bitch, do you?

564
00:39:17,768 --> 00:39:20,331
Cleared his book debt. We're good.

565
00:39:21,056 --> 00:39:22,731
What happens now,

566
00:39:22,851 --> 00:39:24,957
I'm probably gonna lose
more guys 'cause of this.

567
00:39:25,077 --> 00:39:27,596
There won't be another hit
for a while.

568
00:39:27,716 --> 00:39:30,247
That pop-off
was just about dick size.

569
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:32,631
They want to let us
know they're watching.

570
00:39:32,751 --> 00:39:34,941
Vegas'll stick around for a while.

571
00:39:36,745 --> 00:39:38,039
Appreciate that.

572
00:39:41,738 --> 00:39:42,738
Brother.

573
00:39:44,272 --> 00:39:45,272
Yeah.

574
00:39:49,247 --> 00:39:52,895
- I'm sorry about all this, man.
- It's all good. It's all good.

575
00:39:59,963 --> 00:40:02,605
You want to tell me
what happened out there?

576
00:40:02,725 --> 00:40:06,152
I went for a ride to clear my head,
and the Mayans spotted me.

577
00:40:06,272 --> 00:40:07,615
You saw the rest.

578
00:40:12,441 --> 00:40:16,333
Juice will stick around
and watch over the AK assembly.

579
00:40:16,633 --> 00:40:20,459
I'll have Vegas, you know,
bring up some illegals, help him out.

580
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,632
I got some helpers for you.

581
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,465
No, really?

582
00:40:29,466 --> 00:40:31,348
- I love you.
- I know. You don't deserve this.

583
00:40:31,468 --> 00:40:33,679
I love all of you.
Yes, I do. I love all of you.

584
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:35,909
Come on. One, two, three.

585
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:42,290
Look, I want to go back
to see the kid.

586
00:40:43,335 --> 00:40:45,806
I'll ride back
with Happy and his guys.

587
00:40:53,462 --> 00:40:56,270
- How's he doing?
- Hard to say.

588
00:40:57,901 --> 00:40:59,857
I got anything to worry about?

589
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:02,377
Not yet.

590
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,795
Thought that bitch was with you?

591
00:41:29,405 --> 00:41:31,622
Dr. Knowles, this came for you.

592
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:33,285
- Hey.
- Hey.

593
00:41:33,972 --> 00:41:36,789
- How's it going?
- Fine. Your mom's in there.

594
00:41:36,949 --> 00:41:38,612
Where else would she be?

595
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:40,340
How was Nevada?

596
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:42,913
Uneventful.

597
00:41:49,429 --> 00:41:50,429
Hey.

598
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:53,419
You okay?

599
00:41:54,121 --> 00:41:55,121
I'm fine.

600
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:59,270
You think maybe someone
could have called? I've been sitting...

601
00:42:05,016 --> 00:42:06,291
Hey, little guy.

602
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:41,312
