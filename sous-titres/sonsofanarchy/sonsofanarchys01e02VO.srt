1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,089
Previously on Sons of Anarchy.

2
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:06,425
Load the M4's and
Glocks in the truck, huh?

3
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:07,594
Torch it.

4
00:00:09,882 --> 00:00:12,723
- Saw a lot of boot prints.
- Shit-eating Mayans, man.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,748
- The M4's.
- Gone.

6
00:00:15,695 --> 00:00:17,484
As are most of the Glocks.

7
00:00:17,723 --> 00:00:20,056
- You got to see something else.
- Goddamn.

8
00:00:20,176 --> 00:00:21,358
Get rid of the bodies.

9
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:23,233
Don't want this shit
hitting ATF's radar.

10
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:27,821
Found a box of his old shit
in the storage unit.

11
00:00:28,044 --> 00:00:30,194
Just, like, pictures and journals,

12
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:32,951
things I never knew about him.
When you and Dad hooked up,

13
00:00:33,112 --> 00:00:35,914
he ever talk to you about his vision,
about what he wanted from the club?

14
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:37,790
Jax is going through some shit.

15
00:00:37,952 --> 00:00:40,425
He's asking me: did he want
to get into running guns?

16
00:00:40,545 --> 00:00:43,678
He asked me if I thought
we needed to rebuild the factory.

17
00:00:43,798 --> 00:00:47,797
I just want to make sure he's following
in the right father's footsteps.

18
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:50,803
We'll have all the Mayan intel
by the morning. We'll get our guns back.

19
00:00:51,671 --> 00:00:54,598
Put the guns in the van.
Wire this shit hole up.

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,710
Got the good shit.

21
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:22,980
There we go, boys.

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,298
These muffins are great
with tequila, Bobby.

23
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,863
Shit is addictive.

24
00:01:26,983 --> 00:01:28,507
Turning me into Fat Bastard.

25
00:01:28,668 --> 00:01:31,510
Turbinado sugar, organic flour,

26
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:34,513
no processed shit.
Not that any of you give a damn.

27
00:01:34,674 --> 00:01:35,801
You put hash in them?

28
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:38,392
You know my rule:
no bud before 9:00 a.m.

29
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,988
- I don't have that rule.
- Morning, kids.

30
00:01:42,108 --> 00:01:44,481
Deal with the Niners
has officially closed.

31
00:01:45,237 --> 00:01:47,474
Spoke to Laroy, and he is giddy

32
00:01:47,594 --> 00:01:51,552
- about his new assault rifles.
- We're all about racial harmony.

33
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:55,799
Spend it wisely, boys. Might be a while
before we see any more gun green.

34
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:57,363
I love the green.

35
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,949
All about the Benjamins.

36
00:02:01,044 --> 00:02:03,430
I just got an update
from my city hall snitch.

37
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,900
Looks like Hale's got a warrant
to search our warehouse.

38
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:15,986
Shit.

39
00:02:25,744 --> 00:02:28,691
You're a little outside
your jurisdiction, aren't you, Hale?

40
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,868
Something blows up
this close to your town,

41
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:34,262
it would be bad law enforcement
not to look into it.

42
00:02:34,382 --> 00:02:36,992
This is county property.
Sanwa sheriffs can handle this.

43
00:02:37,153 --> 00:02:38,442
You know this guy?

44
00:02:38,562 --> 00:02:39,953
Rodrigo Carpio.

45
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:44,376
Found him in the debris basin,
three bullets in his back.

46
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:47,338
Bluebird Supply business card
in his wallet.

47
00:02:48,048 --> 00:02:50,881
From his rap sheet, I'm guessing
he was employed as security.

48
00:02:51,423 --> 00:02:53,876
- No kidding.
- He died 50 yards

49
00:02:54,613 --> 00:02:55,804
inside Charming.

50
00:02:56,974 --> 00:03:00,854
Bluebird warehouse is part of my murder
investigation, and that's a warrant.

51
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:03,955
In case you'd never actually seen one.

52
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:10,567
- Glad your boy's gonna be all right.
- Yeah, thanks.

53
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:12,554
I'm sorry about last night.

54
00:03:12,674 --> 00:03:15,594
Should've had that place leveled
before the Mayans ever got there.

55
00:03:15,714 --> 00:03:16,977
Made a shit call.

56
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:20,105
Yeah, I'm the one who should've
been there blowing the shit up.

57
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:21,893
Should've never gone to Tahoe.

58
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:24,896
Everything happens for a reason.
If we hadn't hit that warehouse,

59
00:03:25,016 --> 00:03:27,315
we never would've known
about the Nord-Mayan hookup.

60
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:28,277
Right.

61
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:31,180
I got to get this shit to Rosen's guy.

62
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,831
Need a big Jew brain to figure out
these Bluebird losses.

63
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:37,755
Not this big Jew brain, baby.
I can barely count my own fingers.

64
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:41,244
- Gonna go see the kid later.
- Yeah, I'll be there.

65
00:03:41,364 --> 00:03:43,858
And I still want to do that dinner.
Maybe tomorrow night.

66
00:03:43,978 --> 00:03:45,302
- Sure.
- Okay.

67
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,099
Did he say anything about
what he found in storage?

68
00:03:58,676 --> 00:03:59,926
Doesn't matter.

69
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:03,481
Not his old man, stop worrying.

70
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:08,168
Hello.

71
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:13,913
Right.

72
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:18,548
That was Unser.
Got a protection run tonight.

73
00:04:22,654 --> 00:04:23,488
What?

74
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:27,805
I got to tell you something, man.
I mean, it could be bad.

75
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:29,075
It already is.

76
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:33,713
Those two dead Mexicans in
the warehouse hole, I was hitting them.

77
00:04:36,265 --> 00:04:37,604
Jesus Christ.

78
00:04:40,678 --> 00:04:42,828
- Both of them?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

79
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,025
Kind of a taco twofer thing.

80
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:48,123
Tell me one of them doesn't have
a belly full of Tigger juice.

81
00:04:48,284 --> 00:04:49,789
Afraid they both do.

82
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:56,700
You did time, shithead,
you are in the DNA database.

83
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,967
Forensics team gets ahold
of those bodies...

84
00:04:59,128 --> 00:05:00,525
I'll go pull them out of there.

85
00:05:00,645 --> 00:05:02,747
Hale will be watching
that warehouse day and night!

86
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,416
Maybe Trammel can sneak me in.

87
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:06,913
He's a county sheriff,
he outranks the local PD, right?

88
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:09,831
You're just gonna stroll out of there
with two dead Mexi whores

89
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:13,476
- draped over your shoulders.
- I'll gut them dead bitches.

90
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:16,498
I'll flush their bellies with bleach.
No DNA.

91
00:05:18,137 --> 00:05:20,906
What kind of nasty shit
did your mama do to you?

92
00:05:22,092 --> 00:05:23,465
What do you mean?

93
00:05:31,326 --> 00:05:34,734
Enough ammo in here
to give Halliburton a hard-on.

94
00:05:44,252 --> 00:05:45,245
Holy shit.

95
00:05:47,334 --> 00:05:48,808
Jesus Christ.

96
00:05:49,262 --> 00:05:50,357
Tape it off.

97
00:05:50,568 --> 00:05:52,000
Nobody enters.

98
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:55,190
Get me the ETA on that forensic team.

99
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:59,079
Mr. Bluebird just flew
into a brand-new cage.

100
00:06:34,987 --> 00:06:37,950
Episode 102: Seeds

101
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:44,883
What were you thinking... brother?

102
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:48,987
I was thinking about getting my dick
sucked twice.

103
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:52,926
All anybody can prove is that
a couple of brownies swallowed your chum

104
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:55,707
and died hiding from the fire.
You didn't kill anybody.

105
00:06:55,827 --> 00:06:57,783
It's not about the manslaughter rap.

106
00:06:57,903 --> 00:06:59,542
The CSU team tests those bodies,

107
00:06:59,662 --> 00:07:02,564
Tig's DNA puts the gun factory
at our doorstep.

108
00:07:02,684 --> 00:07:06,470
And then ATF takes up permanent
residence in our collective rectums.

109
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,861
That warehouse sits on county property.

110
00:07:08,981 --> 00:07:10,311
Hale will have to wait days

111
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,740
to get San Joaquin to shake loose
a forensic unit.

112
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,381
It's a local case.
County won't get involved.

113
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:18,148
Hale'll just wind up borrowing
a crime scene unit from Lodi.

114
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:22,383
Big Otto's sister still works
for the A.D.A. in Lodi.

115
00:07:22,805 --> 00:07:25,496
Call her. See if there's a forensic team
heading this way.

116
00:07:25,616 --> 00:07:27,032
I gotta have a talk with Unser.

117
00:07:27,193 --> 00:07:29,240
Maybe I can convince the chief to...

118
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,491
put a leash on his hyperactive deputy.

119
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:33,926
Unser's just waiting
for the clock to run out.

120
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:35,896
That old boy's a lame duck.

121
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:39,088
So your boy, not really a team player.

122
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:43,646
I've made several gestures
of friendship. He's declined every one.

123
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:46,075
Hale's not interested in friends.

124
00:07:46,423 --> 00:07:48,987
He thinks Charming's stuck in 1969.

125
00:07:49,107 --> 00:07:51,557
Wants to bring it into the 21st century.

126
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,740
Hale is a half-bright clerk
with a Wyatt Earp complex.

127
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,210
Hardly seems like a guy with a vision.

128
00:07:58,391 --> 00:07:59,714
Don't underestimate him.

129
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:01,730
He's tight with city council
and his old man's

130
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,482
got deep political ties
in Northern Cali.

131
00:08:05,173 --> 00:08:07,323
Yeah. But you're the boss, right?

132
00:08:08,015 --> 00:08:08,993
Come on, Clay.

133
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,914
Since they found the cancer last year,
I got one foot out the door.

134
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,629
I mean, the squad's his now.

135
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:16,674
Be official in a few weeks.

136
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:21,169
This uptight piece of shit
is gonna make our lives miserable.

137
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:23,922
Do you understand what I'm saying?

138
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,305
There's nothing I can do about it.

139
00:08:26,425 --> 00:08:29,575
The doctor and my wife,
they're making me step down.

140
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:31,739
I'm sorry. It's done.

141
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,660
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

142
00:08:37,045 --> 00:08:40,306
This doesn't mean we can't keep
our business arrangement.

143
00:08:40,426 --> 00:08:43,118
Me and you, we had a good thing
going for a lot of years.

144
00:08:43,238 --> 00:08:44,688
We need each other.

145
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:46,635
Yes, we do.

146
00:08:48,114 --> 00:08:49,402
What's the run?

147
00:08:52,802 --> 00:08:55,752
Got Blu-rays and iPods
heading down to San Jose.

148
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,798
Goddamn niggers have been jacking
the shit out of them.

149
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:00,542
Keep your eyes open on this one.

150
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:03,926
I'll make sure they get
where they're going.

151
00:09:14,912 --> 00:09:16,370
How you doing, Jax?

152
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:20,103
Heard about Wendy and the baby.
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:20,957 --> 00:09:21,689
Thanks.

154
00:09:22,972 --> 00:09:25,680
You know, I took a ride out
to the streams today.

155
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,402
Saw that warehouse that burned down.

156
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:29,529
Outside your jurisdiction, ain't it?

157
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:41,333
You ever hear
of a Bluebird Supply Company?

158
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:44,336
Apparently they hold
the title on that parcel.

159
00:09:44,497 --> 00:09:45,578
Never heard of them.

160
00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:48,006
Whole area was littered
with casings and gun parts.

161
00:09:48,684 --> 00:09:50,926
That warehouse was a weapons depot.

162
00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:51,969
No kidding?

163
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:57,048
Chief Unser's retiring
at the end of this month.

164
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:59,579
I'll be stepping into those shoes.

165
00:10:00,054 --> 00:10:03,549
Unser's always had a look-the-other-way
policy with the Sons of Anarchy.

166
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:07,235
- Unser's a lazy drunk.
- I will not look the other way, Jax.

167
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:10,737
Just a friendly heads up.

168
00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:14,788
We're all free men,
protected by the Constitution.

169
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:17,951
You look any way you want, Chief.

170
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:42,576
- He's moving around a lot more.
- Yeah. All his vitals are up.

171
00:10:44,368 --> 00:10:45,918
Any permanent damage?

172
00:10:46,524 --> 00:10:48,250
Because of the drugs, brain or anything?

173
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,519
Can't know for sure,

174
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:52,713
but everything so far
points to full recovery.

175
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:56,208
How long's he gotta be in that thing?

176
00:10:56,328 --> 00:10:57,669
Could be weeks.

177
00:10:57,789 --> 00:10:58,504
But

178
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:02,241
he'll be in the NICU
for at least two or three months.

179
00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:04,730
Hey, look...

180
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:09,632
I'm sorry about last night.

181
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,340
- I wasn't...
- I really don't want to know.

182
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,114
Right.

183
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:21,483
What?

184
00:11:21,603 --> 00:11:24,019
Just figured you'd land
a million miles from this place.

185
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,106
You always hated it here.

186
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:28,768
Oh, I didn't hate Charming, Jax, just...

187
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:32,076
me in it, at the time.

188
00:11:34,918 --> 00:11:36,824
Looks like Wendy's gonna be okay.

189
00:11:38,492 --> 00:11:39,684
Define "okay."

190
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:43,330
We're taking her through sedated detox.
She'll be out for a couple of days.

191
00:11:45,202 --> 00:11:46,180
You two...

192
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:48,585
Are you together?

193
00:11:48,746 --> 00:11:50,653
No, I filed over a year ago.

194
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:54,090
She got clean about ten months back,

195
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:55,856
we tried to reconcile.

196
00:11:56,713 --> 00:11:58,507
Didn't work out too well.

197
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,723
Looks like one good thing
came out of it.

198
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:07,199
Yeah, I guess it did.

199
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:10,502
I should get going.

200
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:13,068
Yeah, I'm late for rounds.

201
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:18,657
It's good to have you back.

202
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:53,616
I'm gonna need the truck.

203
00:12:54,801 --> 00:12:56,816
Why can't you take the wagon?

204
00:12:59,024 --> 00:13:00,638
We're three months behind.

205
00:13:00,758 --> 00:13:04,669
I got to lock it in the garage,
or they'll repo it while I'm at work.

206
00:13:10,012 --> 00:13:12,085
I don't know how to get
in front of this shit.

207
00:13:12,246 --> 00:13:14,407
Getting buried here, Donna.

208
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,383
I'll pick up some weekend work.

209
00:13:17,544 --> 00:13:19,494
You'll get that pay bump soon.

210
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:25,604
We're going to make it through this,
baby.

211
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:26,687
I promise.

212
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:33,148
We'll figure it out.

213
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:42,582
Shouldn't you be at the mill?

214
00:13:43,184 --> 00:13:45,326
I'm on my way. I gotta ask a favor.

215
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,662
What's up?

216
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:52,331
Three months behind on Donna's
car payment, they're gonna repo it.

217
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:54,503
- I hate doing this.
- If you ask me for money,

218
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:55,670
I can't help you.

219
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,631
I just made the quarterly
insurance payments.

220
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:02,101
I'm going to be tapped
until the end of next month, okay?

221
00:14:02,497 --> 00:14:03,762
Look, I'm sorry, son.

222
00:14:04,997 --> 00:14:06,330
That's all right.

223
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,520
Thanks, Pop.

224
00:14:10,564 --> 00:14:11,334
Clay

225
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,685
is making a protection run tonight
for Unser.

226
00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:19,797
It's low profile shit. You ride along,

227
00:14:20,188 --> 00:14:23,881
- scare off the bad guys, huh?
- I think I'm on Clay's shit list.

228
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:25,230
Doubt he'd put me on it.

229
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,454
- Then why don't you make it right?
- I don't know.

230
00:14:29,748 --> 00:14:31,539
I don't know
what the hell's wrong with you.

231
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:33,917
Why don't you quit whining,

232
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:35,467
grow a dick

233
00:14:36,261 --> 00:14:38,398
and take care of of your business?

234
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:44,802
Jimmy Cacuzza called.
The Italians want to place an order.

235
00:14:44,963 --> 00:14:47,630
- I didn't know what to say.
- How about the store burned down,

236
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,500
they missed the fire sale?

237
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:52,257
I talked to Otto's sister,

238
00:14:52,377 --> 00:14:55,480
and Lodi Forensic Team will be here
first thing in the morning.

239
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:58,539
And the shit keeps piling on my head.

240
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:02,630
Only one thing is gonna stop
that Lodi forensics team

241
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,155
from getting to our warehouse.

242
00:15:04,573 --> 00:15:06,777
And that's another murder in Lodi.

243
00:15:10,005 --> 00:15:11,155
I don't know.

244
00:15:11,628 --> 00:15:15,627
Hale's on red alert. Mayans, Nords...
everyone's twitchy as hell, man.

245
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,258
- It's not a good time to kill things.
- It never is,

246
00:15:18,378 --> 00:15:22,215
but we talk about protecting Tig here.
And staying out of ATF's crosshairs.

247
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,136
We hit the projects,
we find ourselves a scumbag,

248
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:28,386
a dealer...

249
00:15:28,506 --> 00:15:31,616
We should off a couple of Nords,
Clay, is what we should do,

250
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:34,979
all right? We should just do that,
then we'll dump the bodies in Lodi.

251
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:38,023
It buys us some time to get
those Mexicans out of the hole.

252
00:15:38,183 --> 00:15:39,758
It sends a message to Darby...

253
00:15:39,878 --> 00:15:41,223
Kill two birds with one crow.

254
00:15:41,343 --> 00:15:43,865
Very clever,
with the cops eyeballing the warehouse?

255
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,073
- Doesn't matter.
- I'll handle that. You set it up.

256
00:15:52,782 --> 00:15:55,541
What if I could do this
without spilling blood?

257
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:02,132
This isn't me tripping some guilt shit
because of my kid.

258
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,632
This is about one of us
thinking straight.

259
00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:06,744
Brains before bullets, right?

260
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,773
Let's hear it.

261
00:16:10,893 --> 00:16:13,675
All we need for a murder
are bodies and a crime scene.

262
00:16:13,795 --> 00:16:15,643
Jackie boy, now you lost me.

263
00:16:15,816 --> 00:16:18,897
Skeeter. He's always got more
gambling debt than he can handle.

264
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,527
I'll make it worth his while.

265
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:24,071
- The cemetery guy?
- Cash for cadavers. I like it.

266
00:16:24,627 --> 00:16:26,276
I give a Lodi a front-page murder.

267
00:16:26,396 --> 00:16:28,868
We don't stir up another shit storm
to bite us in the ass.

268
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,408
What about educating Darby?

269
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:31,779
I'll figure that out.

270
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:34,370
The important things is to keep
your DNA out of the Petri dish.

271
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:36,294
Protect the club.

272
00:16:39,004 --> 00:16:41,461
Path of least resistance
always best, right?

273
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,004
We'll do it your way, VP.

274
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:48,335
All right.

275
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:56,191
Don't make me regret this.

276
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:05,985
- They really cremate bodies here?
- Yeah, we do.

277
00:17:06,146 --> 00:17:08,049
Hey, guys, what's going on?

278
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:11,888
- Need a favor, Skeeter.
- Christ, man, now's not a good time.

279
00:17:12,008 --> 00:17:14,138
Got a supervisor crawling up my ass.

280
00:17:14,258 --> 00:17:16,329
Relax. Not here to make a deposit.

281
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,857
Actually, it's a withdrawal.

282
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:21,043
Need two bodies, fresh.

283
00:17:21,203 --> 00:17:22,387
You serious?

284
00:17:22,507 --> 00:17:23,430
For what?

285
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,547
Well, I could tell you, then
I'd have to stuff you in the furnace.

286
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:30,232
Two dead ones?
That's, that's crazy shit, man.

287
00:17:31,098 --> 00:17:33,540
I'm sure you took a beatin'
at the Golden Gate this weekend.

288
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,807
No, I stopped the ponies, man.
I stopped it all.

289
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:39,079
Gambler's Anonymous three-three,
three months now.

290
00:17:39,694 --> 00:17:40,944
You're kidding.

291
00:17:41,203 --> 00:17:42,555
You don't want the money?

292
00:17:42,675 --> 00:17:44,023
Working a program, you know?

293
00:17:44,617 --> 00:17:45,844
Jesus Christ.

294
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:48,486
Something
you might be able to get for me.

295
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:49,790
What's that?

296
00:17:50,151 --> 00:17:51,354
Emily Duncan.

297
00:17:52,026 --> 00:17:53,712
She's one of our Friday night whores.

298
00:17:53,832 --> 00:17:55,952
She loves a good punch up her knickers.

299
00:17:56,504 --> 00:17:57,854
Yeah, no kidding.

300
00:17:58,004 --> 00:18:00,456
I've been trying to push up
on that for a long time.

301
00:18:01,005 --> 00:18:03,977
You want to hook up with the crow-eater,
I'll make it happen.

302
00:18:04,097 --> 00:18:05,903
Shit, you got a deal.

303
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,550
I'm not cremating anything
till the end of the week.

304
00:18:09,711 --> 00:18:11,926
- Need two by tonight.
- I'm prepping a closed coffin.

305
00:18:12,087 --> 00:18:14,167
Some phone guy took
a header off the top of the pole.

306
00:18:14,287 --> 00:18:15,292
White guy?

307
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:16,766
I'll take it.

308
00:18:16,886 --> 00:18:19,312
- Need a Mexican guy, too.
- Buried one this morning, cheap seats.

309
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,297
- Should still be fresh.
- What do you mean?

310
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:24,439
- That we got to dig it up?
- Who said anything about "we"?

311
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:35,455
This is so wrong, man.

312
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:37,870
This is so wrong.

313
00:18:46,846 --> 00:18:49,088
Hey, Darby. Here, I got you a tamale.

314
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:56,006
I never should have led you
to their gun warehouse.

315
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:58,890
I knew stealing those M4s
was a bad move.

316
00:18:59,444 --> 00:19:00,808
None of my moves are bad.

317
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:02,767
I lost my best guy,

318
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:05,859
niggers got their gats back and
you're out three men and a warehouse.

319
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,070
What the hell would you call it?

320
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,160
Insurance covers the warehouse...

321
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:15,741
and I've always been
about survival of the fittest.

322
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:18,005
If any of Clay's guys
recognize Whistler,

323
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,512
they're gonna come at me...

324
00:19:19,632 --> 00:19:20,412
hard.

325
00:19:21,131 --> 00:19:23,081
We need to combine forces now.

326
00:19:23,966 --> 00:19:25,139
Strike first.

327
00:19:25,556 --> 00:19:26,929
Let the asshole sweat.

328
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:30,172
Spin a little doom about what they saw.
We'll learn from their next move.

329
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:34,019
Their next move is gonna be putting
a bullet in my goddamn dome.

330
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,750
Now we made a deal: we work...

331
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,742
Our deal was me getting the guns
Sam Crow keeps feeing my competition.

332
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:41,767
I get the gats, I cross the Niners.

333
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:45,896
- Starting a war's not smart.
- I got a news flash for you, La Bamba.

334
00:19:46,056 --> 00:19:49,566
I don't give a shit about
some wetback-nigger beef.

335
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:52,569
The only reason that I'm at this table

336
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,812
is because I need muscle

337
00:19:55,191 --> 00:19:57,157
to put Sons of Anarchy
the hell out of Charming.

338
00:19:57,277 --> 00:19:58,575
Now you comprende that?

339
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:02,287
I'll give you some guys to watch
your back in case they retaliate,

340
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:05,207
but we've got to let this shit
calm down before we make our next move.

341
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:08,762
And don't worry.
We'll both get what we want.

342
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,021
Where's my goddamn Suburban?

343
00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:30,816
Who the hell is that?

344
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,569
That, me ol' mukker,

345
00:20:34,352 --> 00:20:37,064
is 130 pounds o' cock-ridin' gidy.

346
00:20:40,075 --> 00:20:41,817
- Hey, Jax.
- Hey.

347
00:20:43,713 --> 00:20:45,867
Chibs said you were looking for me?

348
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:46,941
I'm Emily.

349
00:20:47,357 --> 00:20:49,617
Right! Shit. Sorry.
Come in.

350
00:20:55,694 --> 00:20:56,723
Sit down.

351
00:20:58,244 --> 00:21:00,582
- Nice room.
- Yeah.

352
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:03,579
So,

353
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:06,605
I need you to do a favor
for the club, Emily.

354
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:08,630
Really? Sure. I mean,

355
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,555
what do you need?
What can I do?

356
00:21:11,675 --> 00:21:13,378
You know Skeeter, right?

357
00:21:13,498 --> 00:21:17,195
Yeah, that guy's been trying
to get in my pants since high school.

358
00:21:17,699 --> 00:21:19,198
Need you to let him in.

359
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:21,377
Are you serious?

360
00:21:21,686 --> 00:21:25,046
Dude, that guy burns dead bodies.
He creeps the shit out of me.

361
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:29,079
I know, but we need Skeeter
to do us a good deed.

362
00:21:29,436 --> 00:21:31,710
And the only thing he wants in return...

363
00:21:33,097 --> 00:21:35,422
is the hand of beautiful

364
00:21:36,144 --> 00:21:37,239
Emily Duncan.

365
00:21:38,485 --> 00:21:41,094
- I'm not some whore.
- Come on.

366
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:44,181
- It'll be our secret.
- Yeah.

367
00:21:44,698 --> 00:21:45,991
Cross my heart.

368
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,822
I need you, Emily.

369
00:21:56,124 --> 00:21:57,213
Oh, boy.

370
00:22:11,285 --> 00:22:12,869
You do me, I do him.

371
00:22:14,358 --> 00:22:15,466
Fair enough.

372
00:22:20,656 --> 00:22:23,345
- Do me a favor?
- Absolutely.

373
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:25,699
Put your cut on.

374
00:22:30,954 --> 00:22:33,241
I'm all about the service, darlin'.

375
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:04,415
That's great

376
00:23:04,535 --> 00:23:07,303
Not only do you stink,
but you're a fat bastard, too.

377
00:23:07,423 --> 00:23:09,911
Beware the zombie bikers!

378
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,190
Jesus Christ,
you scared the piss out of me!

379
00:23:17,517 --> 00:23:19,417
- Who's your friend?
- I hate this shit.

380
00:23:19,537 --> 00:23:21,696
It's really bad karma,
digging up a grave, man.

381
00:23:21,816 --> 00:23:25,066
Nah, as long as it's not your grave,
karma's just fine.

382
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:27,117
So, how are we gonna get him out?

383
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,995
I think we're gonna need a tow truck.

384
00:23:37,428 --> 00:23:39,463
Jesus Christ, these guys stink.

385
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:43,133
We'll leave Darby some good
dead Mexican stench.

386
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:46,018
Dude, I... look,
I tell them I lost it in battle,

387
00:23:46,138 --> 00:23:48,930
all they want to do
is wrap their patriotic lips around it.

388
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:58,398
Shit!

389
00:24:01,338 --> 00:24:02,778
That asshole!

390
00:24:02,938 --> 00:24:04,988
They made me spill my beer!

391
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,317
Gemma.

392
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:16,831
- Abel seems better. Stronger.
- Yeah, he's a lucky kid.

393
00:24:16,951 --> 00:24:19,586
Both he and his mom
escaped death in the same night.

394
00:24:21,392 --> 00:24:23,205
I heard about Wendy.

395
00:24:23,325 --> 00:24:24,460
Very sad.

396
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:27,021
I can't say I'm surprised.

397
00:24:28,103 --> 00:24:29,483
Guess you wouldn't be.

398
00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:31,737
- Something on your mind?
- No.

399
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,809
Something weighing on yours?

400
00:24:35,004 --> 00:24:37,233
Junkie tell you something?

401
00:24:37,486 --> 00:24:39,442
No, she's still sedated.

402
00:24:40,136 --> 00:24:42,599
But I talked to her
after that baby was born.

403
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:44,312
She was crushed.

404
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:47,012
She hated herself,
but she wanted to live.

405
00:24:47,949 --> 00:24:49,825
No, somebody else
popped her with that needle.

406
00:24:50,317 --> 00:24:53,067
Or at the very least
gave her the loaded gun.

407
00:25:03,934 --> 00:25:06,172
Guess you think I'm that somebody?

408
00:25:07,594 --> 00:25:10,192
Guess I was the one shooting it
into her fingers and toes

409
00:25:10,312 --> 00:25:12,599
the whole goddamn time
she was pregnant, too.

410
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,411
No, that sin's on her.

411
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,597
If I were a cop, I'd call that motive.

412
00:25:18,952 --> 00:25:21,088
Thank God you're only a doctor.

413
00:25:22,017 --> 00:25:24,946
We'll see what Wendy says
when she comes out of detox.

414
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:29,065
Or maybe I'll bounce
my theory off of Jax,

415
00:25:29,185 --> 00:25:30,935
see where he lands on it.

416
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:34,161
That's how you'll win back his heart,

417
00:25:34,321 --> 00:25:36,743
accusing his mother of trying
to murder his ex-wife?

418
00:25:36,863 --> 00:25:41,243
- Come on, you are smarter than that.
- I am not trying to win back anybody.

419
00:25:41,593 --> 00:25:43,830
No?
Then why'd you come back to Charming?

420
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,133
Because of the job.

421
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:47,667
Which one, doctor or detective?

422
00:25:49,571 --> 00:25:51,710
You still think you can just say

423
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,613
or do anything you want
in this town, don't you?

424
00:25:55,674 --> 00:25:58,846
Everything comes round, Gemma.
No one is untouchable.

425
00:26:01,681 --> 00:26:03,898
You want to touch me, sweetheart?

426
00:26:04,801 --> 00:26:06,305
That make you happy?

427
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,928
You're an idiot, it's not gay.
I've been shaving my shit for years.

428
00:26:19,048 --> 00:26:20,874
- It's totally gay.
- Whatever.

429
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:25,629
Shit.

430
00:26:27,243 --> 00:26:27,990
Shit.

431
00:26:32,235 --> 00:26:34,095
He spotted the smashed front end.

432
00:26:46,543 --> 00:26:48,103
Cops run those bogus plates,

433
00:26:48,223 --> 00:26:50,554
they're gonna search
that SUV from top to bottom.

434
00:26:50,674 --> 00:26:52,989
We got two dead bodies in there, man.

435
00:26:56,694 --> 00:26:58,041
Lodi's got a sky team.

436
00:26:58,161 --> 00:27:00,425
We'll never get away
knowing this piece of shit.

437
00:27:00,545 --> 00:27:01,895
Put the gun away.

438
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:06,125
What's up?

439
00:27:09,082 --> 00:27:10,090
Jesus Christ!

440
00:27:12,585 --> 00:27:13,676
Get back here!

441
00:27:14,315 --> 00:27:15,971
Come on, piggie!
Come on!

442
00:27:27,555 --> 00:27:29,354
Run, prospect, run!

443
00:27:29,894 --> 00:27:31,488
Get in, you faggots!

444
00:27:31,847 --> 00:27:32,982
Run, baby!

445
00:27:33,102 --> 00:27:34,492
Run, boys! Get in!

446
00:27:39,275 --> 00:27:41,365
Bye, copper! Bye!

447
00:27:51,575 --> 00:27:52,340
Thanks.

448
00:27:56,376 --> 00:28:00,261
I haven't had a chance to talk to you
much since you got out of the joint.

449
00:28:01,444 --> 00:28:04,002
Not much to say.
You know what it's like.

450
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:06,627
- Takes a while to adjust.
- Yeah.

451
00:28:08,177 --> 00:28:10,191
Hear Donna's having a rough time of it.

452
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:16,167
Think it was easier for her
when I was inside.

453
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:18,755
She knew what to do then.

454
00:28:19,207 --> 00:28:20,577
Gets that way.

455
00:28:20,737 --> 00:28:23,628
Sometimes the people we love
just don't know the right move.

456
00:28:23,748 --> 00:28:26,236
Crippled by all the shit
they're afraid of.

457
00:28:27,327 --> 00:28:28,843
Donna's not crippled.

458
00:28:30,016 --> 00:28:31,384
She's pissed.

459
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:35,592
How about you, Ope?
You pissed?

460
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:39,763
I mean, guys get locked up,

461
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,329
they resent the loss of freedom,

462
00:28:44,365 --> 00:28:46,334
start doubting the choices they made,

463
00:28:46,454 --> 00:28:48,396
the right and wrong of it all.

464
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,810
I got no resentments.

465
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:52,700
Attaboy.

466
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:56,123
Uncle Jimmy called.

467
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:16,631
I just got a heads up
about a hijack zone.

468
00:29:16,841 --> 00:29:19,047
- Where?
- Coleman off-ramp.

469
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:22,317
Think we should go in the back way,
take 101 instead.

470
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:25,756
You sure you guys know
where the hell you're going?

471
00:29:25,876 --> 00:29:27,793
You sound like my wife.

472
00:29:38,188 --> 00:29:39,747
Okay, bring it forward.

473
00:29:39,867 --> 00:29:41,282
Little more... little more.

474
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:45,183
Good.

475
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:47,580
That sounded nasty.

476
00:29:51,254 --> 00:29:54,390
Someone call Greenpeace,
you're saving a Mexican whale.

477
00:30:00,138 --> 00:30:01,595
Come on, Shamu.

478
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:10,622
Dude...

479
00:30:13,794 --> 00:30:16,076
- Get the blood.
- Come on!

480
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:22,941
Make it look real.

481
00:30:23,061 --> 00:30:25,106
You ain't icing a cake, prospect.

482
00:30:25,226 --> 00:30:27,162
It's a crime scene.
Let's go.

483
00:30:27,322 --> 00:30:28,535
I know, I know.

484
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:32,542
All right, let's do it.

485
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,938
What a beautiful thing!

486
00:30:38,058 --> 00:30:41,130
All right, plant the gun,
I'll leave the message.

487
00:30:47,372 --> 00:30:48,867
All right, let's go!

488
00:31:05,696 --> 00:31:08,674
Circuit City, kiss my guinea ass.

489
00:31:09,323 --> 00:31:11,441
I could move this whole load
for you in two days.

490
00:31:11,561 --> 00:31:13,210
- Good.
- 50-50?

491
00:31:13,879 --> 00:31:15,723
Just throw me ten percent.

492
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:18,024
It's my little gift to you.

493
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:20,629
We had a little setback
with the business.

494
00:31:20,749 --> 00:31:22,331
Yeah, we heard rumors.

495
00:31:22,451 --> 00:31:24,245
- Wetbacks, right?
- Yeah.

496
00:31:24,837 --> 00:31:27,118
It might be a minute
before we're up and running.

497
00:31:27,238 --> 00:31:30,421
I'd appreciate
if you and some of the other crews

498
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:33,817
would be a little patient,
give us some time to get on our feet

499
00:31:33,937 --> 00:31:36,401
before you found another distributor.

500
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:39,080
We might need to go elsewhere
in the short term,

501
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,824
but I'll let the boys know.

502
00:31:40,944 --> 00:31:44,971
They don't any big gun business
with anyone except the Sons.

503
00:31:46,062 --> 00:31:47,492
- Thanks, Jimmy.
- Yeah.

504
00:31:50,488 --> 00:31:52,653
Make it fall off the truck, boys.

505
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:56,344
You knew all this was going down?

506
00:31:57,013 --> 00:32:00,956
Well, I had it in the works
but I wasn't sure till I got the call.

507
00:32:01,076 --> 00:32:05,031
What about your deal with Unser?
We're supposed to protect the cargo.

508
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,970
Chief Unser needed a wake-up call.

509
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:10,387
We needed a goodwill gesture.

510
00:32:10,874 --> 00:32:12,313
It'll all work out.

511
00:32:15,117 --> 00:32:16,641
You wanted in, right?

512
00:32:17,922 --> 00:32:19,155
Yeah, I did.

513
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:26,821
- Wait a minute. You see what I see?
- Aye.

514
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,659
That's that douchebag that cut us off.

515
00:32:38,842 --> 00:32:41,001
Been a very long night, brother.

516
00:32:41,121 --> 00:32:43,381
Come on, won't take long.

517
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:02,192
Pass me one of those Hostess dumb dicks.

518
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,073
What are you doing?!

519
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:12,243
What are you doing?!

520
00:33:12,785 --> 00:33:15,187
Don't ever cut me off again, shithead.

521
00:33:16,966 --> 00:33:18,441
What are you doing?!

522
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:21,252
- My store! This is my store!
- What are you doing?!

523
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:26,391
Why don't you come at me now, asshole!

524
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,935
You okay, Jackie boy?

525
00:33:57,944 --> 00:33:59,211
Holy shit!

526
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,795
What the hell happened out there?

527
00:34:04,452 --> 00:34:06,884
O'Brien Electronics
is my biggest account.

528
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:09,318
Probably the last time they'll use
Unser Trucking

529
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:11,386
to transport their precious cargo.

530
00:34:11,908 --> 00:34:13,605
What are you doing, Clay?

531
00:34:13,725 --> 00:34:16,419
Just keeping a good cop
on the job, is all.

532
00:34:18,873 --> 00:34:21,427
You don't step down
for another six months.

533
00:34:21,547 --> 00:34:23,140
You let us rebuild.

534
00:34:23,904 --> 00:34:27,015
And keep Hale off my goddamn back.

535
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:28,886
If I say no?

536
00:34:29,757 --> 00:34:33,192
Then I'll make sure every truck
leaves this yard hits a roadblock.

537
00:34:36,297 --> 00:34:39,356
- Where's my driver?
- He-he's getting patched up.

538
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:42,233
We convinced him
to keep this incident in-house.

539
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:44,295
Jesus Christ.

540
00:34:45,344 --> 00:34:47,368
This how you treat an old friend?

541
00:34:47,488 --> 00:34:48,265
Nah.

542
00:34:48,805 --> 00:34:50,640
It's how I treat an old cop.

543
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,214
Sorry, Mrs. Winston.

544
00:34:56,329 --> 00:34:59,329
We can't take your checks anymore.
The last two bounced.

545
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:03,840
Okay.
I'll just pay cash.

546
00:35:29,178 --> 00:35:31,728
- What's this?
- Rest of your groceries.

547
00:35:33,354 --> 00:35:34,878
Opie's out now.

548
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:37,388
We don't need any more charity.

549
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,610
Thanks.

550
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,378
It was never charity, Donna.

551
00:35:41,712 --> 00:35:44,043
It's what we do.
You're family.

552
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:47,690
I have my family back.

553
00:35:48,653 --> 00:35:50,168
I don't need yours.

554
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:53,654
Look...

555
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,530
I know what you went through.

556
00:35:57,846 --> 00:35:59,831
Been there, with two husbands.

557
00:36:00,512 --> 00:36:03,164
Lose your man, kids lose their dad,

558
00:36:03,824 --> 00:36:05,517
you get pissed off.

559
00:36:06,129 --> 00:36:07,874
Want to blame the club.

560
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:12,575
But Sam Crow is not the enemy.
It's the glue.

561
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,343
The one thing that will always be there

562
00:36:15,503 --> 00:36:17,680
to pull you through the ugly shit.

563
00:36:20,962 --> 00:36:23,819
Got to stop fighting us, Donna.
You need us.

564
00:36:25,545 --> 00:36:26,781
I married Opie.

565
00:36:28,068 --> 00:36:29,730
I didn't marry the club.

566
00:36:31,514 --> 00:36:33,464
You have no idea what I need.

567
00:36:37,353 --> 00:36:39,593
We're having a little family
dinner tonight.

568
00:36:39,713 --> 00:36:40,993
You and Ope should come.

569
00:36:41,153 --> 00:36:43,246
Bring the kids.
You might actually have a good time.

570
00:36:43,406 --> 00:36:45,522
Don't say anything else.

571
00:36:46,998 --> 00:36:49,461
My Martha Stewart's wearing real thin.

572
00:36:51,747 --> 00:36:53,460
You know where we live.

573
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,265
Why'd you pull my detail
off the warehouse?

574
00:37:02,993 --> 00:37:04,923
I was paying overtime for six unis

575
00:37:05,043 --> 00:37:07,807
to sit on a 20
that's not even in our jurisdiction.

576
00:37:07,927 --> 00:37:09,188
This is my case,

577
00:37:09,348 --> 00:37:12,114
and overtime is not really
your concern anymore.

578
00:37:12,435 --> 00:37:13,818
I'm afraid it is.

579
00:37:14,147 --> 00:37:15,736
Not stepping down yet.

580
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:20,950
What are you talking about?
That's already done.

581
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,455
No, it's not.
Gave city council a heads up.

582
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,414
I'll be keeping the badge
for another six months.

583
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:29,633
What the hell are you doing, Unser?

584
00:37:29,753 --> 00:37:31,530
Right now, getting a haircut.

585
00:37:32,406 --> 00:37:33,337
Bullshit.

586
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:35,845
You've always been in Sam Crow's pocket.

587
00:37:35,965 --> 00:37:38,383
- This is about me.
- Stop talking, son.

588
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,129
One more wrong thing
comes out of your mouth,

589
00:37:41,249 --> 00:37:44,089
and I'll rip that badge off
your puffed-out chest.

590
00:38:00,852 --> 00:38:02,020
Sorry, Floyd.

591
00:38:04,744 --> 00:38:06,644
That boy needs a hot shave.

592
00:38:08,696 --> 00:38:09,707
Yes, he does.

593
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:20,501
"Most of us were not violent by nature.

594
00:38:20,961 --> 00:38:25,128
"We all had our problems with authority,
but none of us were sociopaths.

595
00:38:26,424 --> 00:38:30,336
"We came to realize that when you move
your life off the social grid,

596
00:38:31,922 --> 00:38:34,640
"you give up the safety
that society provides.

597
00:38:35,288 --> 00:38:36,605
"On the fringe...

598
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,182
"blood and bullets are the rule of law,

599
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,390
"and if you're a man with convictions,

600
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:45,826
"violence is inevitable."

601
00:38:56,249 --> 00:38:58,839
I hope they looked better
than this when they blew you.

602
00:39:00,279 --> 00:39:01,232
A little.

603
00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:05,719
Jax?

604
00:39:08,909 --> 00:39:12,282
Jesus, it smells like old socks
and pussy in here.

605
00:39:23,766 --> 00:39:24,858
Hey, darling.

606
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:31,163
They're having a sale on toiletries.
I picked you up some things.

607
00:39:31,323 --> 00:39:32,206
Thanks, Mom.

608
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:34,959
You okay, baby?
You look exhausted.

609
00:39:35,892 --> 00:39:36,905
Long night.

610
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:44,843
That your dad's stuff
you found in storage?

611
00:39:45,447 --> 00:39:46,243
Yeah.

612
00:39:47,104 --> 00:39:50,854
Some pictures, a few Harley manuals,
a bunch of Nam shit.

613
00:39:57,587 --> 00:39:58,737
'80s hair.

614
00:39:59,652 --> 00:40:01,063
How hot was I?

615
00:40:01,306 --> 00:40:02,603
Smokin' hot.

616
00:40:08,296 --> 00:40:10,036
You said you read something?

617
00:40:12,573 --> 00:40:14,802
A few journal entries, nothing much.

618
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:19,802
I'd love to read it.

619
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:22,868
Your father was a real good writer.

620
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:24,925
Always had a knack for it.

621
00:40:25,085 --> 00:40:28,280
You know, I'm the one who bought him
that old Selectric.

622
00:40:29,421 --> 00:40:30,848
- Didn't know that.
- Yeah.

623
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:33,186
Jax! Clay wants you.

624
00:40:37,243 --> 00:40:38,494
Custom job.

625
00:41:46,645 --> 00:41:48,491
Unser's not retiring.

626
00:41:48,688 --> 00:41:51,536
What did you do,
threaten to rape his daughter?

627
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,534
That's a little harsh.

628
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:59,145
Maybe the old man's
not ready for the gold watch.

629
00:41:59,611 --> 00:42:02,340
I just got back
from that Bluebird warehouse.

630
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,306
There were two dead women in the utility
hatch before my guys got pulled off.

631
00:42:06,426 --> 00:42:07,512
They're gone.

632
00:42:07,632 --> 00:42:09,280
They could've been napping.

633
00:42:12,092 --> 00:42:13,213
You guys.

634
00:42:14,773 --> 00:42:17,287
Cruising around here like heroes.

635
00:42:17,814 --> 00:42:19,457
And you and I know the truth.

636
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,221
What truth is that?

637
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:24,461
You're white trash thugs
holding on to a dying dream.

638
00:42:25,308 --> 00:42:27,356
That is so poetic, Chief.

639
00:42:29,038 --> 00:42:31,657
I'm sorry,
I guess it's just Deputy Chief.

640
00:42:33,198 --> 00:42:34,141
Right?

641
00:42:35,828 --> 00:42:39,223
It doesn't matter if I'm chief or not,

642
00:42:39,491 --> 00:42:41,187
you can't stop progress.

643
00:42:41,347 --> 00:42:43,230
It won't be long before Sam Crow

644
00:42:43,889 --> 00:42:47,153
is just an ugly memory
in the history of Charming.

645
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,730
So you enjoy the ride...

646
00:42:52,377 --> 00:42:53,824
while you still can.

647
00:43:02,063 --> 00:43:04,950
- You go get rid of those bodies.
- Yeah, a'ight.

648
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:08,853
Should we say a prayer or something?

649
00:43:08,973 --> 00:43:11,780
You know any Bible passages
about lost semen?

650
00:43:14,464 --> 00:43:16,775
And may the ray...

651
00:43:17,789 --> 00:43:20,120
ray of sunshine warm your souls.

652
00:43:21,346 --> 00:43:22,090
Amen.

653
00:43:25,432 --> 00:43:26,725
Let's burn 'em.

654
00:45:10,188 --> 00:45:12,110
Jax? I need some corn.

655
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:40,949
