1
00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:02,752
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,992 --> 00:00:05,614
Keeping this between us
is the best thing for Opie.

3
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,089
Clay tried to kill my son.

4
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:10,593
Slaughtered his wife by mistake.
I'm depending on you to make that right.

5
00:00:10,762 --> 00:00:13,252
Right now it's about protecting Ope.

6
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:16,184
We feel that it would be best for you
to stop dealing arms

7
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,268
- to the One-Niners and the Mayans.
- Nobody threatens Sam Crow.

8
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:22,730
My baby swallowed something!
He's choking! Please help me!

9
00:00:25,364 --> 00:00:26,525
About a month ago,

10
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:30,112
I found Gemma Teller
in the utility house off 18,

11
00:00:30,525 --> 00:00:33,593
beaten and raped.
It was Zobelle's aryan crew.

12
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:44,251
Stockton called. Inside's a go.

13
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,377
Beating was from the league!

14
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:51,384
We underestimated Zobelle,
the league's reach.

15
00:00:51,553 --> 00:00:52,934
Now he hurts a brother.

16
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:55,513
Retaliation must be harsh
and immediate.

17
00:00:55,683 --> 00:00:59,016
I love Otto. I want to give him his eye,
but not at the expense of my club.

18
00:00:59,244 --> 00:01:00,844
Immediate retaliation.

19
00:01:01,425 --> 00:01:02,475
Absolutely.

20
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:04,856
It's a no.

21
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:10,111
Four-four, no majority.
We wait on retaliation.

22
00:01:15,202 --> 00:01:16,202
Shit!

23
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,510
I'll be right back.

24
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:55,131
Boy's got a strong constitution.

25
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:58,521
Anybody could take a blast,
it's him.

26
00:02:06,462 --> 00:02:09,312
I ran the registration
and vin on the minivan.

27
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,555
Both bogus.

28
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,303
I need to know what happened.

29
00:02:20,526 --> 00:02:23,265
Lot of volatile liquid
here at the garage.

30
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,260
Forensics finds anything else,

31
00:02:27,682 --> 00:02:29,832
feds will be all over this place.

32
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,138
Bombs are Homeland Security shit.

33
00:02:33,524 --> 00:02:36,624
You let 'em make the evidence point
to what it was:

34
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,400
an accident.

35
00:02:42,187 --> 00:02:44,487
I know what you gotta do here, Clay,

36
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:47,174
but we both know Zobelle

37
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:49,668
has caused enough damage
in this town.

38
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,129
What happened to Chibs

39
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,340
cannot blow back in Charming.

40
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:56,509
Then you get me a home address

41
00:02:56,947 --> 00:02:58,347
on him and Weston.

42
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:01,013
They both live out of town.

43
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,881
Otherwise, I do it here.

44
00:03:03,991 --> 00:03:06,434
And then you'll be watching
main street

45
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:08,154
on the 10:00 news.

46
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:11,585
Jesus Christ!

47
00:03:23,743 --> 00:03:25,093
This was Zobelle.

48
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,892
Otto, now Chibs.

49
00:03:29,368 --> 00:03:31,368
This guy's trying to break us.

50
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:33,699
All of us.

51
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:39,317
There's gotta be something
we can find on this guy.

52
00:03:39,868 --> 00:03:41,495
He doesn't make mistakes.

53
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,820
I pushed us off retaliation for Otto,
but after this,

54
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:47,571
Clay will go at Zobelle full bore.

55
00:03:48,614 --> 00:03:51,914
I got a bad feeling
we'll be walking right into a trap.

56
00:03:52,185 --> 00:03:54,733
- Then don't play it out.
- Not the way this works.

57
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,502
Someone hurts us like this,
we retaliate.

58
00:03:57,932 --> 00:03:58,932
Have to.

59
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:02,885
That's it?
You're gonna run blind off the cliff?

60
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,369
Maybe not.

61
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,374
If I can get to Zobelle first,
I can protect the club.

62
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,376
What happens when you find him?

63
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:14,042
You tell me.

64
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,305
You asking me to help Sam Crow?

65
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,830
We both know this guy's got
some kind of leverage on you.

66
00:04:25,118 --> 00:04:27,418
Think of it as a self-serving favor.

67
00:04:32,086 --> 00:04:33,436
I go off the grid

68
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:37,160
and I help you find this guy,
you've got to promise

69
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,403
that you will hand him over to me

70
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:40,934
alive.

71
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:43,365
What do you do?
You can't arrest him.

72
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:45,244
Bring him in
as a person of interest,

73
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,247
question him up to 24 hours.

74
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:50,164
At least it gives Clay
a chance to calm down,

75
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:53,897
maybe you get
your crew thinking straight.

76
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:56,433
All right.

77
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,190
I get to him first,
I give him to you.

78
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:01,832
Do it by the book.

79
00:05:02,495 --> 00:05:05,679
I'll dig into the cigar shop records,
see if I can find a home address.

80
00:05:06,028 --> 00:05:07,728
Pull Weston's info, too.

81
00:05:08,657 --> 00:05:11,018
If they're a dead end,
we can always rattle Darby.

82
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,060
Need some help.

83
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:20,560
What's the matter?

84
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:22,349
Don't know what to do.

85
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:25,771
This thing with Chibs...
Gonna push Ope farther away.

86
00:05:27,464 --> 00:05:31,064
- What are you talking about?
- Don't come home much anymore.

87
00:05:31,436 --> 00:05:34,036
If he does,
he barely speaks to his kids.

88
00:05:34,161 --> 00:05:36,411
They have no idea what's happening.

89
00:05:37,557 --> 00:05:39,357
I didn't sign up for this.

90
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:42,003
Kids need a mother, a father.

91
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:44,045
Tried talking to Ope.

92
00:05:45,682 --> 00:05:47,132
I didn't raise him.

93
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,210
We got no history.

94
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:51,809
Talk to Piney about it?

95
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,636
He's on his way to the cabin.

96
00:05:53,761 --> 00:05:56,311
This will be a four-day bender
at least.

97
00:06:02,838 --> 00:06:04,788
I don't know how to help Ope.

98
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,308
Talk to him.

99
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:11,997
Please.

100
00:06:14,914 --> 00:06:15,791
All right.

101
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,752
I'm gonna head over to St. Thomas.

102
00:06:20,877 --> 00:06:23,477
I'll call you as soon as
I hear anything.

103
00:06:30,318 --> 00:06:32,368
They're waiting for you inside.

104
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:40,336
What?

105
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,737
Someone blew up
your friend with a car bomb.

106
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:46,822
We don't know what happened.

107
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:48,769
Jesus Christ.

108
00:06:49,558 --> 00:06:51,108
We watched it happen.

109
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:55,139
Who the hell would do that?
Why would anyone do that?

110
00:06:58,789 --> 00:06:59,789
Look,

111
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:02,463
I'm not sure who did it
and that's the truth.

112
00:07:02,694 --> 00:07:05,394
Probably the same guys
who had Otto jumped.

113
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:07,641
Are you in danger?

114
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,530
Am I?

115
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:18,688
God.

116
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:22,182
Look,

117
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:25,558
I'm sure nothing's gonna happen.

118
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:28,373
Just gotta be smart,

119
00:07:29,062 --> 00:07:30,991
a little more cautious, all right?

120
00:07:31,436 --> 00:07:33,186
It's gonna be okay, babe.

121
00:07:35,382 --> 00:07:36,532
No, it's not.

122
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,193
I have to go deal with this.

123
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,473
This explosion...

124
00:07:59,684 --> 00:08:01,814
Those the same people
who attacked you?

125
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:05,511
And if it was?

126
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:08,112
Maybe if you told somebody

127
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,030
- about what happened...
- This isn't on me.

128
00:08:18,368 --> 00:08:20,634
Unser's getting us home addresses.

129
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,934
You really think Zobelle
is sitting in his barcalounge

130
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:24,909
waiting for us to swing by?

131
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:26,706
Why should he hide?

132
00:08:27,752 --> 00:08:30,050
The asshole thinks
he's protected on every level.

133
00:08:30,437 --> 00:08:31,437
He is.

134
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:34,596
Probably riding four-deep.
Weston, skinhead crew.

135
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,099
- Then we ride five-deep.
- And what's the plan?

136
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:39,601
Roll up on him in broad daylight,
cut off his head?

137
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:44,523
You know,
I don't give a shit what the plan is!

138
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:48,694
I am tired of sittin' here
playing "What happens if?"

139
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:51,248
Zobelle tried to kill two of us
in the last 12 hours!

140
00:08:51,373 --> 00:08:54,324
This charter doesn't wait any longer!
We kill him!

141
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,624
Do I need to take a vote?

142
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:33,417
You living here now?

143
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:36,278
Crashing once in a while.

144
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,466
I talked to your mom.

145
00:09:39,152 --> 00:09:41,371
She's worried about her grandkids.

146
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:44,277
Said they never see
their dad anymore.

147
00:09:44,802 --> 00:09:46,302
It's not your worry.

148
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,088
Problem of my brother's
is a problem of mine, right?

149
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,593
I don't have a problem.

150
00:09:51,718 --> 00:09:53,068
My kids are fine.

151
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:57,299
Okay, look, man,

152
00:09:58,244 --> 00:09:59,690
I think it's all good

153
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:01,865
you getting deeper in the club,

154
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,604
but you're obviously still dealing
with some shit.

155
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:08,788
Donna's death
has got to be a nightmare...

156
00:10:08,913 --> 00:10:11,175
How do you know
what I'm dealing with?

157
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,935
You got to figure out your own shit,
brother.

158
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,660
I know what I'm doing.

159
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,070
You got things you want to change.

160
00:10:21,073 --> 00:10:22,073
I get it.

161
00:10:23,032 --> 00:10:24,732
But this beef with Clay,

162
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,586
it's not about what's best for Sam Crow,
it's about you...

163
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,324
Pushing to be king.

164
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,798
It's not your time yet, man.

165
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:37,188
This is Clay's club.

166
00:10:37,873 --> 00:10:40,073
You got to back down, get in line.

167
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:45,381

Shit.

181
00:11:46,003 --> 00:11:49,583
- What's this mick bastard doing here?
- The Irish love a good car bomb.

182
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,335
You being here in broad daylight.

183
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:53,337
It's not the smartest move.

184
00:11:54,307 --> 00:11:56,288
My dad thought it'd be wise
to come find out

185
00:11:56,413 --> 00:11:58,498
- what all the noise was last night.
- Accident.

186
00:11:58,623 --> 00:12:01,094
Chibs rubbed
some wrong wires together.

187
00:12:01,998 --> 00:12:03,918
I grew up in South Armagh, boys.

188
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:06,936
Sodium nitrate was a fragrance
of my youth. Know it anywhere.

189
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:10,611
- We're dealing with the problem.
- The problem is the feds.

190
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:13,565
- This blast will bring them around.
- It ain't gonna get that far.

191
00:12:14,188 --> 00:12:16,693
You tell your old man
we got it contained.

192
00:12:18,748 --> 00:12:19,748
Sure.

193
00:12:20,263 --> 00:12:23,563
I'll let the folks know
there's nothing to worry about.

194
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:32,296
- Locations of our two white friends.
- Thanks.

195
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,415
How long before Lodi forensics
gets out here?

196
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,966
It's flagged as a priority.

197
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:42,345
- I'm surprised they're not here yet.
- You may want

198
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,430
to send your boys out for donuts.
Let us tidy up a little bit.

199
00:12:47,506 --> 00:12:49,106
They do look famished.

200
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:52,156
<i>Zobelle rents a house in morada.</i>

201
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:54,373
Had their PD pay a visit.
No one's home.

202
00:12:54,498 --> 00:12:55,982
Still getting weston's info.

203
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,236
Meet me at Darby's.

204
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:01,947
I want you to power scrub
the shit out of this place.

205
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:04,244
I want it clueless for CSU.

206
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,380
- Sparkle and shine.
- Let's go find Zobelle.

207
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:11,298
You need me with you?

208
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:14,769
I'm thinking one of us
should be there for Chibs.

209
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,394
Yeah, you should go.

210
00:13:17,935 --> 00:13:19,381
I'll keep you plugged in.

211
00:13:27,902 --> 00:13:29,311
Think he's on board?

212
00:13:29,436 --> 00:13:30,684
I don't give a shit.

213
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:31,810
He's not.

214
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:35,585
He knows better than to try
to stop the retaliation after this,

215
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,689
but he's working something else.

216
00:13:37,814 --> 00:13:39,151
Just keep an eye on him.

217
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:42,816
Give me a call
if you hear anything else.

218
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:43,822
Sure, sir.

219
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:51,719
- His truck's not here.
- His workers saw him last night.

220
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:53,665
Darby told them to be here at 7:00.

221
00:13:54,619 --> 00:13:56,369
He's crawled into a hole.

222
00:13:58,192 --> 00:13:59,692
I'll put out an ATL.

223
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,130
If Darby's in Charming,
we'll find him.

224
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:07,918
DC to dispatch. Issue an attempt
to locate on ernest Darby...

225
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:10,176
Thought you were at St. Thomas.

226
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:12,369
No news on Chibs yet.

227
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,562
Figured maybe Darby
could point us to Zobelle.

228
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:17,689
Guess Hale had the same idea?

229
00:14:18,142 --> 00:14:19,142
Guess so.

230
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:21,800
Thought you were running down
the home addresses.

231
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:24,375
Clay wanted fewer guys.
Lower profile.

232
00:14:25,252 --> 00:14:26,952
His club. He knows best.

233
00:14:28,273 --> 00:14:29,473
Anything here?

234
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
Dead end.

235
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,684
I'll wait for you.

236
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:37,609
We can ride back together.

237
00:14:38,494 --> 00:14:39,544
Sure thing.

238
00:14:44,058 --> 00:14:45,558
What was that about?

239
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,954
It's about shit being upside down.

240
00:14:51,315 --> 00:14:53,315
Call me with Weston's address.

241
00:14:53,557 --> 00:14:54,857
Where you going?

242
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,130
Lose my best friend.

243
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,960
Shit.

244
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:20,378
What the hell are you doing?

245
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,103
This is a crime scene.

246
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,439
I'm sorry. I have OCD,
and the mess was, like,

247
00:15:27,564 --> 00:15:30,414
- freaking me out. I...
- Where's Charming PD?

248
00:15:32,068 --> 00:15:33,890
What the hell's going on here?!

249
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,261
Shit, I thought you guys left.

250
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:40,814
Get the hell out of here!
It's a goddamn crime scene!

251
00:15:41,093 --> 00:15:42,093
Idiot!

252
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,567
This your watch?

253
00:15:44,128 --> 00:15:45,628
I was taking a piss.

254
00:15:45,753 --> 00:15:46,653
I'm sorry.

255
00:15:48,753 --> 00:15:50,198
We'll take it from here.

256
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,969
Shit.

257
00:16:24,737 --> 00:16:26,687
What are we going to do here?

258
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:29,941
- What's this?
- Cancer drugs.

259
00:16:30,594 --> 00:16:32,444
Turns my waste radioactive.

260
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:37,117
I'm holding a cup of your piss?

261
00:16:37,932 --> 00:16:39,205
Spill this on the kit.

262
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,748
Turns their results into
a bad chemistry experiment.

263
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:48,423
Just need to figure a way it don't get
me arrested for evidence tampering.

264
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:52,372
Go chat 'em up.

265
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:55,279
And then take my lead.
You and your piss.

266
00:17:01,005 --> 00:17:02,354
Get you boys anything?

267
00:17:02,716 --> 00:17:04,416
A beverage of some sort?

268
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:06,197
We're fine, thanks.

269
00:17:07,313 --> 00:17:09,361
What do you think
caused this blast anyway?

270
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,197
You need to clear out of here.
We're still collecting...

271
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:13,379
Look out!

272
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,413
Holy shit!

273
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,427
I am so sorry.
Are you guys all right?

274
00:17:21,552 --> 00:17:23,708
I thought that they changed out
the brake drums.

275
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,041
Damn, I'm sorry.

276
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,666
You stupid shithead.

277
00:17:28,717 --> 00:17:30,317
What the hell is that?

278
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,519
Diet cola.

279
00:17:33,257 --> 00:17:34,969
Tastes like piss, don't it?

280
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,812
Apparently some of our friends
in Charming have been looking for me.

281
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:45,568
When we finish here,

282
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:49,068
head to the shop.
I suspect they will be coming to you.

283
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,830
They're here.

284
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:06,710
This is my daughter, Polly.

285
00:18:07,178 --> 00:18:09,045
Cammy Hayes. My boy, Edmond.

286
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,004
Glad we finally get
to meet in person.

287
00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:16,179
- Someplace private we can talk?
- Yes, of course.

288
00:18:17,824 --> 00:18:19,824
Why don't you keep me company.

289
00:18:24,193 --> 00:18:26,896
- You part of all this?
- That so hard to believe?

290
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:29,916
You just don't look like...

291
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:31,216
I don't know.

292
00:18:31,464 --> 00:18:33,069
You don't like the way I look?

293
00:18:33,523 --> 00:18:34,773
No... I mean...

294
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,691
You look fine, darlin'.

295
00:18:39,372 --> 00:18:41,280
Think you already know that.

296
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:50,279
- Grab us a couple of beers?
- Yes, ma'am.

297
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:01,814
I followed Jax to Darby's.

298
00:19:01,939 --> 00:19:04,893
It was a dead end.
But he knew I was tailing him.

299
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:06,811
He lost me at the Corcoran pass.

300
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:07,979
Shit.

301
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,130
There's no one at Zobelle's house.

302
00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:11,608
Phones off.
Lose the cut.

303
00:19:12,628 --> 00:19:15,178
- Weston's?
- Up here around the corner.

304
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,556
AJ Weston? Charming Police.

305
00:19:27,194 --> 00:19:28,194
Window.

306
00:19:28,394 --> 00:19:29,394
I saw it.

307
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,477
Stay here.

308
00:20:23,395 --> 00:20:25,151
Get out of the way.

309
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:27,251
Go!

310
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:35,967
Jesus Christ.

311
00:20:38,031 --> 00:20:39,831
I'm not going to hurt you.

312
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,616
I'm just looking for your dad.
I'm a friend of his.

313
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,213
Let me see the ink!

314
00:20:44,922 --> 00:20:47,407
- What?
- Your tats. Prove it!

315
00:20:50,562 --> 00:20:52,812
Let's just put the guns down, okay?

316
00:21:04,674 --> 00:21:06,324
I got all kinds of ink.

317
00:21:14,143 --> 00:21:15,230
It's a kid!

318
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:18,524
Hold your fire!

319
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,830
Liar.

320
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:33,041
Where's your dad, shithead?

321
00:21:33,236 --> 00:21:35,668
I ain't telling you shit, race traitor!

322
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,460
Call child services.
Have this little psychopath committed.

323
00:21:50,132 --> 00:21:52,227
Come on.
I ain't afraid of no cop!

324
00:21:52,685 --> 00:21:54,835
- Shut up.
- Found his computer.

325
00:21:55,052 --> 00:21:57,477
Password protected.
Can't get in.

326
00:21:58,168 --> 00:21:59,685
Bring it to juice.

327
00:22:02,783 --> 00:22:04,554
I guess you're running with hale now.

328
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:07,283
Just working things from my end.
Same goal.

329
00:22:07,408 --> 00:22:08,368
What's that?

330
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:11,452
Keep the boss happy.

331
00:22:15,882 --> 00:22:18,017
Couldn't stop the forensic team.

332
00:22:19,091 --> 00:22:20,171
Now what?

333
00:22:50,154 --> 00:22:52,052
Guess they ain't open yet.

334
00:23:00,738 --> 00:23:02,120
Chibs is stable,

335
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,541
but critical.

336
00:23:04,354 --> 00:23:08,050
He landed on the back of his head,
caused a subdural hematoma.

337
00:23:09,604 --> 00:23:11,256
A large blood clot.

338
00:23:11,856 --> 00:23:15,860
A brain bleed is severe, but if
it subsides, it's not life threatening.

339
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,704
All we can do now is monitor it.

340
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,273
If it gets worse?

341
00:23:20,752 --> 00:23:23,652
They'll have to go in
and relieve the pressure.

342
00:23:24,165 --> 00:23:25,540
Jesus Christ.

343
00:23:25,665 --> 00:23:29,015
- Cut open his head?
- Hopefully, it won't come to that.

344
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,077
I'm sorry about what I said earlier.
I didn't mean...

345
00:23:35,202 --> 00:23:36,202
It's okay.

346
00:23:37,823 --> 00:23:40,501
It's a shitty day for all of us.

347
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,717
You mind if I head home with you?

348
00:23:50,052 --> 00:23:51,052
Sure.

349
00:23:53,372 --> 00:23:55,266
I'll just finish up a few things.

350
00:23:55,786 --> 00:23:58,386
- I'll wait for you downstairs.
- Thanks.

351
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,376
How's Chibs?

352
00:24:06,587 --> 00:24:07,587
Critical.

353
00:24:08,426 --> 00:24:09,426
I'm sorry.

354
00:24:11,524 --> 00:24:13,624
- You got a minute?
- For what?

355
00:24:21,234 --> 00:24:22,234
I've...

356
00:24:23,644 --> 00:24:25,046
Kind of hit a wall

357
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,115
trying to find who did this.

358
00:24:32,213 --> 00:24:34,113
I was hoping you could help.

359
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,431
Me?

360
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,059
I don't know anything
more than the guys do.

361
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,108
Unser told me some things.

362
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:48,594
About you.

363
00:24:49,937 --> 00:24:52,587
And what happened.
At least what he knows.

364
00:24:55,673 --> 00:24:56,786
Piece of shit.

365
00:24:57,092 --> 00:24:58,792
- He had to.
- Shut up!

366
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,834
We both know this thing
with Chibs was Zobelle.

367
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,843
Give me something,

368
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:15,151
Any detail,
anything you can remember.

369
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:18,242
It never goes on record.

370
00:25:18,922 --> 00:25:21,109
The secret keeps.
Just...

371
00:25:21,974 --> 00:25:23,062
point me somewhere.

372
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:26,330
Why are you suddenly
so interested in helping us?

373
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,985
I became a cop,

374
00:25:30,051 --> 00:25:32,801
doesn't mean I don't give
a shit about folks

375
00:25:32,997 --> 00:25:34,247
I grew up with.

376
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,839
You want to hurt this guy.

377
00:25:42,343 --> 00:25:43,343
I do.

378
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:52,937
Girl in her 20s,

379
00:25:54,871 --> 00:25:55,871
cute,

380
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,490
blonde...

381
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,079
Good rack.

382
00:26:03,843 --> 00:26:05,593
She's the only one I saw.

383
00:26:07,387 --> 00:26:08,573
Thank you.

384
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:12,060
- And I am sorry...
- You

385
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:14,644
or your cancerous boss

386
00:26:15,545 --> 00:26:17,945
tell anyone else
what happened to me,

387
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:22,587
and I will cut both of your big,
soft hearts out.

388
00:26:26,524 --> 00:26:27,524
Copy that.

389
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:43,744
He's pissed.

390
00:26:46,253 --> 00:26:48,898
- What the hell is this?
- Where you headed?

391
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:50,859
What do you care?
What is he doing with you?

392
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:54,487
- You on their payroll now, too?
- Just answer the question.

393
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,991
I'm going to see my mom.
She's sick.

394
00:26:59,254 --> 00:27:00,660
Your mother died last month.

395
00:27:01,174 --> 00:27:04,124
- My other mother.
- All right, where's Zobelle?

396
00:27:05,378 --> 00:27:07,902
How do I know? What,
is this about the blast last night?

397
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:09,769
What do you think?
If Zobelle

398
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:12,879
did have something to do with it,
Nords knew nothing about it.

399
00:27:13,004 --> 00:27:15,508
Unlike Sam Crow,
we don't blow up shit in our own town.

400
00:27:16,194 --> 00:27:19,693
Don't show up for work this morning.
Now you're heading out of town.

401
00:27:19,818 --> 00:27:21,668
You running from something?

402
00:27:23,753 --> 00:27:25,935
I got a heads up that shit
might go down.

403
00:27:26,351 --> 00:27:27,853
No other details.

404
00:27:28,155 --> 00:27:29,805
I'm on my way to Vegas.

405
00:27:30,003 --> 00:27:31,003
That's it.

406
00:27:31,213 --> 00:27:32,563
That's the truth.

407
00:27:34,704 --> 00:27:36,622
You know anything about a blond,

408
00:27:36,747 --> 00:27:38,573
20s, good tits?

409
00:27:39,071 --> 00:27:41,767
- Sounds like Zobelle's daughter.
- I've seen her hang with Weston.

410
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:42,952
Can I go?

411
00:27:49,946 --> 00:27:50,946
Thanks.

412
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:52,969
Dicks.

413
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,924
Where did you
get the intel on the girl?

414
00:27:58,582 --> 00:28:02,586
Description turned up when we canvassed
the street minivan was towed from.

415
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:31,992
You still have the one I gave you?

416
00:28:36,801 --> 00:28:38,883
I got rid of it after Kohn left.

417
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:45,515
Wait here.

418
00:28:56,631 --> 00:28:57,617
Jesus Christ.

419
00:28:57,742 --> 00:28:59,945
Do you and clay really
need this many guns?

420
00:29:00,722 --> 00:29:02,222
These are just mine.

421
00:29:04,647 --> 00:29:05,647
Here.

422
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:07,811
See how this feels.

423
00:29:13,725 --> 00:29:15,169
It's okay.
It's not too heavy.

424
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:17,207
.38.

425
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,700
That'll blow a good hole.

426
00:29:31,084 --> 00:29:32,603
What's this for?

427
00:29:33,502 --> 00:29:34,502
Let's go.

428
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:36,065
Where?

429
00:29:47,943 --> 00:29:49,370
Squeeze slowly.

430
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,235
It'll have some kick.

431
00:29:57,404 --> 00:29:58,864
You're gripping too hard.

432
00:29:58,989 --> 00:30:01,789
You want to hold it firm,
but let it breathe.

433
00:30:02,953 --> 00:30:03,801
All right.

434
00:30:04,651 --> 00:30:07,251
Now, put the sight on
what you want dead,

435
00:30:07,469 --> 00:30:09,073
then take a breath.

436
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,605
And...

437
00:30:16,994 --> 00:30:17,994
Good.

438
00:30:34,516 --> 00:30:36,260
Is it always like this?

439
00:30:42,478 --> 00:30:44,675
You came back to him at a bad time.

440
00:30:46,332 --> 00:30:47,937
It settles down.

441
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,116
It gets downright boring,

442
00:30:50,241 --> 00:30:51,241
I promise.

443
00:31:05,902 --> 00:31:07,052
That was fun.

444
00:31:07,757 --> 00:31:09,435
You're gonna love this.

445
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,866
Some mess.

446
00:31:43,474 --> 00:31:44,902
I've already filed a report.

447
00:31:45,232 --> 00:31:46,232
I know.

448
00:31:47,182 --> 00:31:48,364
We'll look into that.

449
00:31:48,965 --> 00:31:50,324
I'm sure you will.

450
00:31:54,324 --> 00:31:56,372
You must be Ethan Zobelle's daughter.

451
00:31:56,784 --> 00:31:57,784
Polly.

452
00:31:58,178 --> 00:32:00,378
- I'm the deputy chief.
- I know.

453
00:32:00,914 --> 00:32:02,664
I'm looking for your dad.

454
00:32:02,986 --> 00:32:04,215
Haven't seen him.

455
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,923
Why don't you give him a call.

456
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:09,542
- It's important I connect with him.
- I'm not his keeper.

457
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,136
He's wanted for questioning.

458
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,838
And if you're lying to me,

459
00:32:12,963 --> 00:32:16,513
that means you're interfering
with a criminal investigation.

460
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:22,481
What do I look like,
one of your inbred natives?

461
00:32:24,132 --> 00:32:25,132
Come on,

462
00:32:25,371 --> 00:32:26,921
charge me or get out.

463
00:32:35,714 --> 00:32:38,051
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

464
00:32:41,504 --> 00:32:42,882
I slice open my arm,

465
00:32:43,007 --> 00:32:46,113
I charge you with aggravated
assault on a peace officer.

466
00:32:46,238 --> 00:32:48,560
My old man was a judge.
You'll do a three-year pop

467
00:32:48,685 --> 00:32:50,009
at the Sanwa dyke lodge,

468
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:52,177
no questions asked.

469
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,936
There's a big rally at
the Christian Center in Morada.

470
00:33:01,817 --> 00:33:02,867
The league?

471
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:05,384
Weston's rowdy crowd.

472
00:33:05,604 --> 00:33:06,567
Prison muscle.

473
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:10,135
Daddy's giving his reformer speech.
Tends to work 'em up.

474
00:33:15,697 --> 00:33:17,322
I need you to come with me.

475
00:33:17,447 --> 00:33:19,413
Why?
I told you the truth.

476
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,881
That truth needs to stay between us.

477
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:24,627
Going to keep that
from your daddy for awhile.

478
00:33:26,188 --> 00:33:27,482
Station house.

479
00:33:33,323 --> 00:33:36,055
Zobelle is at
the Christian center in Morada.

480
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:38,473
Big aryan membership rally tonight.

481
00:33:39,001 --> 00:33:40,560
Can Morada PD pick him up?

482
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,854
It's Weston's prison crew. It could get
ugly. Better off sending the sheriffs.

483
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:58,133
How's Chibs doing?

484
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,319
The bleeding stopped.
He's still critical,

485
00:34:00,444 --> 00:34:02,665
but if it holds,
he'll be out of the woods.

486
00:34:03,465 --> 00:34:04,615
That's great.

487
00:34:05,234 --> 00:34:06,234
Thank you.

488
00:34:07,555 --> 00:34:09,305
I'm sorry about all this.

489
00:34:10,061 --> 00:34:12,261
I'm telling you as much as I know.

490
00:34:13,574 --> 00:34:14,574
It's okay.

491
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:16,756
It'll ease up.

492
00:34:17,552 --> 00:34:18,552
It will.

493
00:34:25,924 --> 00:34:27,624
I got a call from Luann.

494
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:32,759
Apparently there was some kind
of firearm incident out at Caracara.

495
00:34:32,928 --> 00:34:33,978
No kidding?

496
00:34:36,562 --> 00:34:37,866
I love you.

497
00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:39,472
You should.

498
00:34:45,323 --> 00:34:47,653
Checked his house
and the cigar shop again.

499
00:34:47,778 --> 00:34:50,379
Still off the map.
Zobelle knows we're looking for him.

500
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:53,298
- Asshole has to surface.
- And we won't be able to do shit.

501
00:34:53,786 --> 00:34:55,357
The feds are on their way.

502
00:34:55,482 --> 00:34:57,871
We're gonna be ass deep
in some bad suits by morning.

503
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:58,996
Shit.

504
00:34:59,449 --> 00:35:00,788
I think we got something.

505
00:35:00,913 --> 00:35:03,475
There's an appointment
in Weston's calendar for tonight.

506
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,083
He tagged it "EZ, MCC."

507
00:35:09,147 --> 00:35:10,741
Morada Christian Center.

508
00:35:10,866 --> 00:35:11,942
Off Alhambra.

509
00:35:18,355 --> 00:35:19,655
What's going on?

510
00:35:20,211 --> 00:35:22,119
They think they know
where Zobelle is.

511
00:35:22,573 --> 00:35:24,323
Christian Center, Morada.

512
00:35:30,053 --> 00:35:31,053
Shit.

513
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:38,142
I understand you had
a new partner today.

514
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:39,970
Just trying to contain this.

515
00:35:40,337 --> 00:35:42,099
So much for that plan.

516
00:35:45,133 --> 00:35:46,894
There's something I need to tell you.

517
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,146
You girls swapping diaries again?
Huh?

518
00:35:51,563 --> 00:35:53,273
I needed some information.

519
00:35:53,398 --> 00:35:55,577
- Shit.
- You have no idea.

520
00:35:56,411 --> 00:35:57,194
Come on.

521
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:00,919
I'd prefer the feds didn't see
the beating I'm about to take.

522
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,981
- When are the sheriffs coming?
- <i>I called them. I'm not sure. Why?</i>

523
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:19,233
I had to tell Hale.

524
00:36:19,518 --> 00:36:23,518
He was getting seduced by Zobelle's
"I'm good for Charming" bullshit.

525
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:25,578
I'm sorry.

526
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:29,214
The thing that happened to Chibs,
it was definitely Zobelle?

527
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:30,689
Can't prove shit,

528
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:32,869
but I know it in my gut.

529
00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:34,115
We all do.

530
00:36:35,154 --> 00:36:36,387
Nothing I know

531
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:38,699
could have stopped that blast.

532
00:36:39,168 --> 00:36:43,075
Clay taking on what happened to me would
have... Would have made it worse.

533
00:36:44,096 --> 00:36:45,246
That's right.

534
00:36:49,969 --> 00:36:50,969
I'm sorry.

535
00:36:53,417 --> 00:36:56,477
This ain't on you, sweetheart.

536
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,660
I'm start...

537
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,110
I'm starting to think that...

538
00:37:05,686 --> 00:37:06,936
It's all on me.

539
00:37:11,455 --> 00:37:12,455
I know.

540
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,473
Couple buses out front,

541
00:37:15,598 --> 00:37:16,859
a few cars in the lot,

542
00:37:17,147 --> 00:37:18,352
Zobelle's Mercedes.

543
00:37:18,477 --> 00:37:21,123
- Two ab guys out front.
- There's a side door.

544
00:37:21,248 --> 00:37:22,448
It'll be easy.

545
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:23,667
Good.

546
00:37:23,889 --> 00:37:26,055
What, we kick in the doors,
grab Zobelle?

547
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,037
- We do it in front of an audience?
- Come on, it's Weston's crew.

548
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,655
It's a handful of ex-cons and scumbags.

549
00:37:31,934 --> 00:37:35,938
- Not really reliable witnesses.
- We'll let them make the first move.

550
00:37:37,072 --> 00:37:38,797
It's more than a handful.

551
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:43,635
It's a membership rally.
It's going to be packed with ab.

552
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,660
- How the hell do you know that?
- Hale grilled Zobelle's daughter.

553
00:37:48,073 --> 00:37:50,822
He's sending sheriffs
to pick him up for questioning.

554
00:37:50,947 --> 00:37:52,938
We got cops on the way?

555
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:56,481
Then, we better hurry.

556
00:37:58,341 --> 00:38:00,027
Anything else you want to tell us?

557
00:38:02,522 --> 00:38:03,604
We do this,

558
00:38:04,028 --> 00:38:05,680
we all go to jail.

559
00:38:07,042 --> 00:38:09,086
AKs and shotguns.
Let's go.

560
00:38:46,146 --> 00:38:47,770
Keep your mouth shut.

561
00:38:49,338 --> 00:38:50,488
Give me that.

562
00:39:01,649 --> 00:39:02,899
- <i>Ready?</i>
- We're set.

563
00:39:03,101 --> 00:39:04,151
Five count.

564
00:39:04,414 --> 00:39:05,414
One,

565
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,560
two...

566
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,720
What the hell, man?

567
00:39:33,597 --> 00:39:34,597
Got him.

568
00:39:35,427 --> 00:39:37,666
We got to get the hell out of here.
Out now!

569
00:39:38,017 --> 00:39:38,875
Now!

570
00:39:45,122 --> 00:39:46,122
Shit.

571
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,300
Call it in.

572
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:51,930
Drop the guns, now!

573
00:39:53,983 --> 00:39:55,720
Drop 'em, now!

574
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:03,575
Holy shit.
