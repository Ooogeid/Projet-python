1
00:00:00,914 --> 00:00:02,714
Previously on Sons of Anarchy...

2
00:00:02,876 --> 00:00:05,716
- You promised you were done with this.
- It's got nothing to do with you.

3
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:07,635
I get shit on
if you get caught again.

4
00:00:07,797 --> 00:00:09,345
I can't live this way anymore.

5
00:00:09,506 --> 00:00:11,382
Half our goddamn fights
are about money,

6
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:14,308
and I can't get ahead without the club.
I want back in, Jax.

7
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:16,770
That ATF agent. I was with him.

8
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,189
It got violent. I tried to end it.
He started stalking me.

9
00:00:21,626 --> 00:00:23,108
Once a biker slut, always a...

10
00:00:24,813 --> 00:00:26,070
Who the hell are you?

11
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,156
- ATF.
- Just what we need.

12
00:00:28,317 --> 00:00:30,408
You guys want to rent
a goddamn wing?

13
00:00:30,568 --> 00:00:32,415
Cam Hayes. Michael's cousin.

14
00:00:32,535 --> 00:00:33,869
Here's to Michael McKeavy.

15
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,455
Good soldier, good friend.

16
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:36,910
- Hear.
- Hear.

17
00:00:38,894 --> 00:00:41,169
He's hurt real bad.
We gotta get him back to the clubhouse.

18
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:42,712
I need you to do me a favor.

19
00:00:42,872 --> 00:00:44,804
Brenan Hefner.
You gotta take him out.

20
00:00:44,924 --> 00:00:46,465
Take him out. Means, like, kill him.

21
00:00:46,628 --> 00:00:48,257
Doc's here.
He's going to fix you up.

22
00:00:49,254 --> 00:00:51,120
I got the slugs out
and stopped the bleeding.

23
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,431
If the penicillin kills the infection,
he should make it.

24
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:56,141
Cameron was supposed
to kill that piece of shit Hefner.

25
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:58,310
- Murder for hire.
- It's not about money.

26
00:00:58,471 --> 00:00:59,937
That asshole killed McKeavy.

27
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:01,749
- Who does it?
- I do.

28
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:04,192
No mistakes.

29
00:01:04,353 --> 00:01:06,235
I want Ope pulling the trigger
on this.

30
00:01:08,304 --> 00:01:09,304
Shit.

31
00:01:16,353 --> 00:01:19,525
- You gonna pick me up after work?
- Yeah, if I can.

32
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:22,883
Bye.

33
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,507
My permits are up to date.
Actors all have their HIV card.

34
00:01:37,627 --> 00:01:39,445
What's my shit got to do with ATF?

35
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:41,939
Why should Vice
get all the fun, huh?

36
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:45,817
Viagra, poppers, blow.

37
00:01:46,363 --> 00:01:48,318
- Tools of the trade.
- This is bullshit.

38
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,541
Actually, it's possession,
maybe even intent to distribute.

39
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:52,812
Shut it down.

40
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,112
It's a wrap for Cecil B. DeMilf.

41
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:01,245
- When's Donna getting back?
- This morning.

42
00:02:07,855 --> 00:02:10,424
You haven't said much
to me since Oakland.

43
00:02:11,988 --> 00:02:14,135
Don't got much to say, I guess.

44
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:19,254
You were right. I wasn't ready.

45
00:02:21,602 --> 00:02:22,686
It's done, bro.

46
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,994
You doing all right with all that?

47
00:02:33,768 --> 00:02:37,556
I'm just a bit out of practice dealing
with that shit, you know?

48
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,382
It's about something bigger, man:

49
00:02:42,502 --> 00:02:44,030
club, family.

50
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:47,440
That got you past it?

51
00:03:02,564 --> 00:03:04,258
I'm trying to run a department here.

52
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:07,928
You mind telling me how
I'm gonna do that without an office?

53
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:10,143
You know about this?

54
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:11,556
No one knew.

55
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:13,445
I love a good surprise.

56
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:16,511
What the hell is going on?

57
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:19,073
I'm borrowing your house
for a couple weeks.

58
00:03:19,193 --> 00:03:20,843
Gonna be a little tight.

59
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,077
And what's your business here?

60
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:26,012
What do you think, Chief, huh?

61
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,127
I bet you've already made a call
to Clay Morrow.

62
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:32,755
Your personal and professional
relationship with the Sons of Anarchy

63
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,133
- has been well documented.
- Is that so?

64
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,197
Escort Chief Unser out.

65
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:41,067
He poses a security risk
to my investigation.

66
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:44,727
You scrawny, uptight bitch.

67
00:03:45,711 --> 00:03:49,304
You don't know shit about me
or this town.

68
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,945
Why don't you take
a little down time, Wayne?

69
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:57,028
Play golf, go fishing...

70
00:03:57,566 --> 00:03:59,616
get a round of chemo, you know.

71
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:01,067
Relax.

72
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:10,419
You didn't have to humiliate
the guy.

73
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:14,116
You're the one who got this ball
rolling. You wanna play in my backyard

74
00:04:14,236 --> 00:04:17,320
- or the cow pastures?
- I want to stop Sam Crow.

75
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,331
Good.
Then let's catch up.

76
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:24,383
We know the Sons are getting
their guns in oil barrels

77
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:26,018
from Dungloe, Ireland.

78
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:27,437
That's IRA territory.

79
00:04:27,704 --> 00:04:31,569
True IRA territory. These guys
did not buy into the peace accord.

80
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:35,139
The guns are how they keep
their Pro-Irish agenda on fire.

81
00:04:36,214 --> 00:04:39,157
Michael McKeavy, big Irish player.

82
00:04:39,318 --> 00:04:41,074
He was found beaten to death
2 weeks ago,

83
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,207
Pier 56, Oakland shipyard.

84
00:04:43,795 --> 00:04:45,954
- You think this was Clay?
- No, I don't.

85
00:04:46,116 --> 00:04:47,448
I think it was this guy.

86
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:50,546
Brenan Hefner,
Oakland Port Commissioner. Very dirty.

87
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,086
I think that a deal went south
and Hefner killed McKeavy.

88
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:54,505
Who killed Hefner?

89
00:04:57,317 --> 00:04:58,317
Sam Crow.

90
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:04,200
McKeavy was a friend.
Hefner was an obstacle.

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,634
He was found
gunned down in the projects.

92
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:09,519
Oakland DA's gonna keep me informed.

93
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,765
This intel,

94
00:05:11,035 --> 00:05:13,888
the murders we had here last week,
this all points to the Sons.

95
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:16,343
Yes, and I've got shit to convict.

96
00:05:16,463 --> 00:05:18,716
It's all circumstantial evidence.

97
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:22,923
That is why I am going to use RICO.

98
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,290
We need to prove
that the Sons of Anarchy

99
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,819
is an ongoing criminal enterprise.

100
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,636
And how does Luann Delaney
play into this?

101
00:05:31,756 --> 00:05:34,509
We have to show that there's been
illegal activity over the past 10 years,

102
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:36,822
so we use Luann's incarceration

103
00:05:36,942 --> 00:05:40,092
as a bargaining chip with her husband,
Otto Delaney.

104
00:05:40,212 --> 00:05:42,970
We dig up dirt in the past,
and then go after the present.

105
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,317
These guys will never rat.

106
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,978
You're really missing
the theme here, honey.

107
00:05:51,953 --> 00:05:52,938
Outlaw clubs

108
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:55,690
do not keep their women in the dark.

109
00:05:56,343 --> 00:05:57,505
They're smart.

110
00:05:58,151 --> 00:05:59,360
They use them.

111
00:06:00,147 --> 00:06:02,948
We go after the ones
who have the most to lose.

112
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:04,257
Job...

113
00:06:04,628 --> 00:06:05,628
family...

114
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:07,786
freedom.

115
00:06:09,098 --> 00:06:11,915
She's not one of them.
Tara's not one of them.

116
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:16,197
We've had surveillance
on the club for the last four days,

117
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:18,934
and Tara has spent
every night there.

118
00:06:19,686 --> 00:06:20,778
Kohn was right:

119
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:23,652
he pushed her straight
into Teller's arms.

120
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,680
What's the matter, Deputy?

121
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:29,057
You got a little stiffy
for Miss Tara?

122
00:06:29,434 --> 00:06:30,654
Tara, she's...

123
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:34,229
No, she's just an old friend.

124
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:38,005
Where should I put these?

125
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:40,694
- Put those in my office.
- Thanks, Hale.

126
00:06:46,827 --> 00:06:48,429
I really don't get it.

127
00:07:20,436 --> 00:07:24,026
Episode 110: Better Half

128
00:07:40,058 --> 00:07:41,881
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

129
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,966
Missed a few Sundays.
Trying to catch up a bit.

130
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,220
You Catholic?

131
00:07:48,852 --> 00:07:50,655
I'm whatever I need to be.

132
00:07:55,554 --> 00:07:57,104
How's the Irishman?

133
00:07:59,928 --> 00:08:00,973
Divine.

134
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:03,821
He hasn't left the cabin yet,
has he?

135
00:08:04,032 --> 00:08:05,871
Today's the first day
he's been on his feet.

136
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:07,656
Make sure he stays put.

137
00:08:07,776 --> 00:08:09,446
Unser just called.

138
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,993
That ATF bitch is back in Charming.

139
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:13,471
Shit.

140
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:17,132
- What's going on?
- I'm not sure yet, but,

141
00:08:17,411 --> 00:08:18,941
if Cameron's anything like McKeavy,

142
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:21,693
he's probably
on a dozen federal watch lists.

143
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:23,797
Gonna have Happy come down,

144
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,298
smuggle him out up north.

145
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:27,958
- Jesus Christ, Clay.
- I know.

146
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,221
We'll get through it, baby.
We always do.

147
00:08:31,876 --> 00:08:32,974
Be careful.

148
00:08:36,819 --> 00:08:38,123
What's going on?

149
00:08:39,272 --> 00:08:40,231
Feds are back.

150
00:08:41,246 --> 00:08:44,397
We got to keep you up here
till we can get you out.

151
00:08:45,222 --> 00:08:47,070
Do you believe in God, Gemma?

152
00:08:49,246 --> 00:08:50,730
I believe in family.

153
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,053
You think that's enough?

154
00:08:59,394 --> 00:09:00,920
Who are you kidding?

155
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:05,214
Sitting here

156
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,431
ticking off Hail Marys.

157
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,370
You think that gives you
some kind of heavenly pass?

158
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:14,376
God's gonna open the pearly gates

159
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:17,225
when those next two bullets
catch you in the head?

160
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:20,245
It's all a little absurd, I guess.

161
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:22,689
Truth is, I know I'm going to hell.

162
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,525
The praying just makes my time here
a little less miserable.

163
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,780
A few Acts of Contrition
could make you feel good, too, love.

164
00:09:35,068 --> 00:09:36,674
There's only one way

165
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,577
these beads
could make me feel good...

166
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:41,244
love.

167
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:45,983
And it involves
a whole different act.

168
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:51,933
Must be hard.

169
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:54,235
Two kids, full-time job,

170
00:09:55,158 --> 00:09:56,808
behind on the mortgage.

171
00:09:57,122 --> 00:10:00,222
- What is it, $32,000 in credit debt?
- We get by.

172
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:02,722
Or you get out.

173
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:07,450
Then, those moving boxes
suggest the latter.

174
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,114
You're smart, Donna.

175
00:10:13,497 --> 00:10:14,794
You get your kids

176
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,601
and you get as far away
as you possibly can

177
00:10:17,721 --> 00:10:19,871
before Sam Crow rips
your family apart.

178
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:22,603
It's only a matter of time
before Opie's back inside again.

179
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,531
- We both know...
- I don't need a cop

180
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:27,161
to tell me what's wrong
with my family.

181
00:10:29,031 --> 00:10:32,296
I don't know shit about
Opie's club business.

182
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,360
And even if I did...

183
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:38,271
I'd never rat on him.

184
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:45,133
Get out of my house, bitch.

185
00:10:53,455 --> 00:10:55,199
I know we got cash
tied up in the rebuild,

186
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,617
but I was hoping to get
my payout for Hefner.

187
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,718
Two mortgage payments behind.

188
00:11:01,838 --> 00:11:04,007
You should've said something, man.

189
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:06,209
I mean, waiting for the cash
wasn't mandatory.

190
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,218
I know.
I was just trying to help the club.

191
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:11,668
That's all right. I'll pull it out
of the treasury funds.

192
00:11:12,225 --> 00:11:13,275
Thanks, man.

193
00:11:18,522 --> 00:11:19,973
- You doing okay?
- Yeah.

194
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,313
Just...

195
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,310
shit at home.

196
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,507
I got it handled.

197
00:11:29,203 --> 00:11:31,038
What's going on with him?

198
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:32,760
His heart's in it,

199
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,926
and his head's someplace else.

200
00:11:37,484 --> 00:11:40,118
Too much of that shit
going around lately.

201
00:12:05,404 --> 00:12:07,788
- Can I help you?
- Dr. Knowles?

202
00:12:07,908 --> 00:12:09,748
I'm Agent Stahl, ATF.

203
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,660
May I ask you some questions?

204
00:12:14,355 --> 00:12:15,404
Of course.

205
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:20,989
Thank you.

206
00:12:25,274 --> 00:12:28,985
I'm trying to wrap my brain
around your history with Sam Crow.

207
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,989
Excuse me?

208
00:12:32,109 --> 00:12:34,540
Wait, your mom died
when you were nine.

209
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,604
You left Charming

210
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:39,011
and your drunk daddy 11 years ago.

211
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:41,653
Moved in with an aunt in San Diego.

212
00:12:42,535 --> 00:12:44,885
- My father's cousin.
- Right, right.

213
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:48,040
You graduated at UCSD with honors.

214
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,103
You were top of the class
at Loyola Med,

215
00:12:50,223 --> 00:12:54,099
and you did your internship
at Chicago Presbyterian.

216
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,310
Really very impressive.

217
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,553
Yeah, I know. I was there.

218
00:13:01,678 --> 00:13:03,287
And now you're here...

219
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:06,234
at Saint Redneck's...

220
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,643
getting dirty
with the bad boys again.

221
00:13:11,254 --> 00:13:12,886
How does that happen?

222
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:18,512
My personal life is really none
of your business. What do you want?

223
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:19,959
Fair enough.

224
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:22,761
Do you know of any illegal activity
that Jax Teller

225
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:25,392
or the Sons of Anarchy
are involved in?

226
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:30,321
No, I don't.

227
00:13:32,705 --> 00:13:34,023
That was easy.

228
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,285
Listen,

229
00:13:37,661 --> 00:13:38,711
if you do...

230
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:41,431
think of something or

231
00:13:42,037 --> 00:13:44,599
you see something
that just doesn't feel right,

232
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:46,856
would you please give me a call?

233
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,310
Thank you for your time.

234
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:55,420
Now, what exactly is it
you're hoping to find?

235
00:13:56,553 --> 00:14:00,487
Just wondering what digging
up dirt on old girlfriends gets you.

236
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,343
Is that what Kohn liked?

237
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:05,042
Your inquisitive nature?

238
00:14:06,615 --> 00:14:10,169
Understand that he never
got off the plane in Chicago.

239
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:11,733
He's MIA.

240
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:15,524
Threw away his career for love.

241
00:14:15,977 --> 00:14:18,426
I just hope
you're not doing the same.

242
00:14:19,183 --> 00:14:20,183
Doctor.

243
00:14:45,924 --> 00:14:48,542
She knew all about me.
She knows about us...

244
00:14:48,662 --> 00:14:49,912
It's all smoke.

245
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,605
Look, they've got nothing
on Sam Crow,

246
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,771
so now they're harassing people
close to us.

247
00:14:56,036 --> 00:14:57,036
I'm sorry.

248
00:15:00,538 --> 00:15:02,188
You didn't say anything?

249
00:15:03,098 --> 00:15:04,448
No. Of course not.

250
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:09,155
She mentioned Kohn. Said he was MIA.

251
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:12,834
Kohn was a wanted man.

252
00:15:13,642 --> 00:15:16,834
He didn't show up in Chicago
'cause he doesn't want to go to jail.

253
00:15:17,306 --> 00:15:19,791
Probably halfway
around the world by now.

254
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:21,061
Yeah, halfway.

255
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:26,935
This will never blow back on you.

256
00:15:27,055 --> 00:15:28,512
That's a promise.

257
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:32,475
I won't let you get hurt.

258
00:15:35,822 --> 00:15:36,851
Okay?

259
00:16:00,038 --> 00:16:03,721
This will cover the mortgage,
put a dent in some of the bills.

260
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,136
Where are the kids?

261
00:16:08,348 --> 00:16:10,398
Next door. Lena's watching them.

262
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:12,850
So I don't get a say in any of this?

263
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,790
I didn't get a say
in this decision, did I?

264
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,941
Right.

265
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,939
There was an ATF agent here
this morning.

266
00:16:20,724 --> 00:16:22,417
She's a real nasty bitch.

267
00:16:22,537 --> 00:16:24,587
Grilled me about you, the club.

268
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:28,725
Said Sam Crow
was gonna tear apart my family.

269
00:16:30,546 --> 00:16:31,591
I'm sorry.

270
00:16:32,161 --> 00:16:33,744
I'm moving in with my mom.

271
00:16:33,864 --> 00:16:35,913
Find a place
near her for me and the kids...

272
00:16:36,074 --> 00:16:37,246
Donna, just...

273
00:16:40,123 --> 00:16:41,577
Why did you stay?

274
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:43,785
- What?
- When I was inside.

275
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:46,174
Why the hell
didn't you get out five years ago?.

276
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:50,083
- The kids were babies.
- Don't put it on the kids!

277
00:16:50,423 --> 00:16:52,346
You knew that I was gonna go back
to Sam Crow.

278
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:55,228
What the hell else was I gonna do?
I'm not your brother.

279
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,698
I'm not your dad.

280
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,663
Can't be a good old boy
chopping from 6:00 to 6:00.

281
00:17:00,783 --> 00:17:02,229
I earn with the club.

282
00:17:02,349 --> 00:17:04,430
That's what I know.
That's how I support this family.

283
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,532
I'm doing this because of you!

284
00:17:08,975 --> 00:17:11,025
Because I love you and the kids.

285
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,899
If you can't get behind that...

286
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:21,001
keep packing.

287
00:17:22,005 --> 00:17:23,834
I'm gonna go see my kids.

288
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:38,177
I gotta talk to you.

289
00:17:38,831 --> 00:17:40,357
I didn't want to go by your place

290
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:43,327
because I'm afraid
the feds might be watching.

291
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:45,929
What do you know about that?

292
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:48,540
They just came
to the nail salon looking for me.

293
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,728
I called Half-Sack,

294
00:17:49,848 --> 00:17:52,498
and the feds are going after
all the women.

295
00:17:53,478 --> 00:17:55,228
It's just a scare tactic.

296
00:17:55,972 --> 00:17:58,555
Tell them you open beers
and suck dick. That's it.

297
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:00,201
They got nothing.

298
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,108
I haven't been completely honest
with Half-Sack.

299
00:18:05,613 --> 00:18:08,102
I don't like where this is going.

300
00:18:08,535 --> 00:18:10,051
I'm sorta married.

301
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:12,379
Sorta?

302
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:14,480
He was a sadistic asshole.

303
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,417
He wouldn't divorce me, so I left.

304
00:18:16,537 --> 00:18:18,767
Took everything. Took the car,

305
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,290
took the money, took the dog.

306
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:23,522
You're wanted for grand theft.

307
00:18:25,163 --> 00:18:26,163
And arson.

308
00:18:26,914 --> 00:18:28,317
I burned down our condo.

309
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,441
Nice touch.

310
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:33,881
- He was such a dick, Gemma.
- Jesus Christ, Cherry.

311
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,995
It's actually Rita.

312
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,059
Cherry was our dog's name

313
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:44,349
and she died and I always
liked it better than mine.

314
00:18:45,077 --> 00:18:46,313
That's sweet.

315
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,919
What am I gonna do?

316
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,090
I love Half-Sack.

317
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,677
It's going so good, Gemma.
What the hell am I going to do?

318
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,804
You gotta get out of here, Rita.

319
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:59,182
But I don't want to leave him.

320
00:18:59,664 --> 00:19:02,414
They're going to threaten you
with jail time.

321
00:19:02,699 --> 00:19:04,378
Yeah, but I'm not a rat.

322
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,091
You ever been inside?

323
00:19:08,786 --> 00:19:09,786
Shit.

324
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:23,665
Not so fast.

325
00:19:23,825 --> 00:19:24,861
Shit.

326
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:29,877
Very impressive, Vicky.

327
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:33,420
Hard to find
good help these days, hmm?

328
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,990
Know what you mean.

329
00:19:36,312 --> 00:19:38,721
That little tart
doesn't know anything.

330
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:42,411
What about the porn star?
We've got her in custody, too.

331
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:46,544
She can probably teach you
how to give a great hummer,

332
00:19:46,664 --> 00:19:48,731
but I'm guessing
you've got that covered.

333
00:19:49,653 --> 00:19:50,653
I get by.

334
00:19:52,476 --> 00:19:55,426
Picking off the ones
that have the most to lose.

335
00:19:55,664 --> 00:19:56,664
Smart.

336
00:19:56,932 --> 00:19:58,518
That's how I'd do it.

337
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:01,041
I've seen you in action.

338
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:03,496
You almost killed that one
with a skateboard, didn't you?

339
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:06,243
- We've mended fences.
- I guess so.

340
00:20:06,363 --> 00:20:09,650
What was she doing,
asking for the queen's advice?

341
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,953
What lies to tell?

342
00:20:14,016 --> 00:20:17,586
I'll bet that there's enough secrets

343
00:20:17,706 --> 00:20:20,472
in that pretty head of yours
to bury an empire.

344
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:26,818
I'm just a wife and mother, darling.

345
00:20:28,338 --> 00:20:30,482
You know... you might want...

346
00:20:31,379 --> 00:20:34,593
to unscrew that penis sometimes.

347
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,780
It's fun being a girl.

348
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:39,297
If you want me...

349
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,353
you know where I live.

350
00:20:52,566 --> 00:20:53,976
You're lucky, Rita.

351
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,291
Nobody died in the fire.

352
00:20:57,963 --> 00:20:59,716
Yeah, I gave it my best shot.

353
00:21:02,447 --> 00:21:06,059
Apparently, he was more upset
about losing his dog than you.

354
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,687
It was my dog.

355
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:14,234
What can you tell me
about Indian Hills, Nevada?

356
00:21:15,035 --> 00:21:17,670
Sons of Anarchy patching
over the Devil's Tribe?

357
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:19,876
Nothing.

358
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:22,301
Well, I doubt that.

359
00:21:22,757 --> 00:21:24,967
You got balls, sweetheart.
I'll give you that.

360
00:21:25,447 --> 00:21:28,352
The club must have
found you very resourceful.

361
00:21:32,478 --> 00:21:35,070
Nothing?
All right, we're going nothing, then?

362
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,464
I'll go start
your extradition paperwork.

363
00:21:37,945 --> 00:21:39,022
Extradition?

364
00:21:39,142 --> 00:21:42,095
Yeah. Nevada, they want you back.

365
00:21:42,564 --> 00:21:45,098
Probably throw attempted
murder at you: 25 years.

366
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:47,796
You'll get out just
in time for menopause.

367
00:21:49,012 --> 00:21:51,477
You think about that for a while,

368
00:21:51,736 --> 00:21:54,191
and we'll talk
before you leave, okay?

369
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,067
My God.

370
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:04,224
Got Luann on drug charges,
Cherry on theft and arson.

371
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:06,961
That don't make sense.

372
00:22:07,081 --> 00:22:09,000
Stahl's trying to use RICO.

373
00:22:09,469 --> 00:22:12,292
If you could prove her case,
she could take you all down.

374
00:22:12,573 --> 00:22:13,877
And if we go down?

375
00:22:14,037 --> 00:22:16,838
Why do you think I'm sitting
at the goddamn table, Scotty?

376
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,592
Anything to be worried about
with the doc?

377
00:22:20,752 --> 00:22:22,587
She's seen a lot of shit
over the last weeks.

378
00:22:22,707 --> 00:22:25,466
Little Miss Tara's the one
who got the ATF here in the first place.

379
00:22:25,586 --> 00:22:28,558
You got nothing to worry
about with Tara. I trust her.

380
00:22:30,846 --> 00:22:33,439
Rosen can't get through
to Otto in Stockton.

381
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:35,190
He's on federal watch.

382
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:37,933
No calls in or out.

383
00:22:38,956 --> 00:22:39,902
Shit!

384
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,423
Stahl's squeezing him for history?

385
00:22:42,543 --> 00:22:44,491
Using Luann as leverage.

386
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:46,142
Otto will never rat.

387
00:22:47,723 --> 00:22:50,026
Now, if it was me
and they had Gemma,

388
00:22:50,979 --> 00:22:54,376
I'd give 'em something useless.
Some old shit, wouldn't hurt the club.

389
00:22:55,048 --> 00:22:57,862
With RICO, no info's useless.

390
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,832
The way Otto pines for Luann,

391
00:23:00,952 --> 00:23:02,759
he'd do anything
he can to protect her.

392
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:04,219
Little Cherry pie

393
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,389
- knows all about Indian Hills.
- Cherry would never say nothing.

394
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:08,549
Yeah?

395
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:11,685
You willing to bet
your top rocker on that, prospect?

396
00:23:12,575 --> 00:23:16,021
We all have our past
and present indiscretions, boys.

397
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:20,929
Goddamn ATF bitch.
Goddamn bitch!

398
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,418
They keep the girls
in your cell overnight?

399
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:30,328
- You still got your keys?
- What are you thinking here?

400
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:31,945
Get a message to Luann.

401
00:23:32,065 --> 00:23:34,750
She talks to Otto, she can warn him
about Stahl using RICO.

402
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,242
What about Cherry?

403
00:23:36,712 --> 00:23:38,091
We'll see where she's at.

404
00:23:38,637 --> 00:23:40,208
You think you can get me inside?

405
00:23:40,957 --> 00:23:43,330
I doubt the feds are
working around the clock,

406
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:46,714
but I got four guys
and Dispatch on 11:00 to 7:00.

407
00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:49,541
Maybe we come up with
something keeps them busy.

408
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,309
Well, you clear 'em out,
I'll get you in.

409
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,091
- What about, like, security cameras?
- It's a police station.

410
00:23:56,354 --> 00:23:58,690
I got cops.
I don't need cameras.

411
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,990
Maybe I should go with you,
talk to Cherry.

412
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,940
No, retard, you shouldn't.

413
00:24:07,484 --> 00:24:08,492
Me and Ope.

414
00:24:18,476 --> 00:24:20,378
- Everybody in favor?
- Hear, hear.

415
00:24:20,947 --> 00:24:22,730
- Yeah.
- Hear, hear.

416
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:28,637
Put your goddamn hand down.

417
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:37,452
Otto, I'm Agent Stahl, ATF.

418
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,502
Luann sends her best.

419
00:24:41,257 --> 00:24:43,193
Too bad you don't
have a sister prison.

420
00:24:43,353 --> 00:24:46,571
You guys could visit each other.
Go to the dance together.

421
00:24:48,347 --> 00:24:50,056
We raided your wife's studio.

422
00:24:50,593 --> 00:24:53,948
Found enough narcotics
to put her away for a dime, maybe more.

423
00:24:54,972 --> 00:24:57,141
Jesus Christ, Luann.

424
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:58,529
Yeah, it's very sad.

425
00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:01,843
All those teenage boys
with nothing to jerk off to.

426
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,553
What do you want?

427
00:25:04,673 --> 00:25:07,968
You give me something on Sam Crow,
and I cut your wife loose.

428
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:10,262
You went after her to get to me?

429
00:25:11,702 --> 00:25:13,175
It's a waste of time.

430
00:25:14,185 --> 00:25:15,678
Turn the camera off.

431
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:21,817
All right, look, I'm gonna be
straight with you, okay?

432
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:25,435
I got this bullshit
case dumped on me.

433
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:29,656
Last thing I want to be doing
is running around humping outlaw bikers.

434
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:33,506
I just need something
to take back to my bosses.

435
00:25:33,626 --> 00:25:37,163
If the intel leads nowhere,
then I really don't give a shit.

436
00:25:44,193 --> 00:25:46,867
I know you have a parole
up in three months.

437
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:49,046
If you help me with this,

438
00:25:50,413 --> 00:25:52,259
I can make it happen this time.

439
00:25:59,106 --> 00:26:01,523
And you'd throw me a recommendation?

440
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:04,667
I would.

441
00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:07,381
Luann walks,

442
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:10,682
you get out of here
and I get to move on to a real case.

443
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,325
This is a win-win-win situation.

444
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:17,228
Shit I know is all dead.

445
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:19,559
I'm not plugged
into Sam Crow anymore.

446
00:26:20,994 --> 00:26:23,091
My boss doesn't know that, does he?

447
00:26:23,211 --> 00:26:26,049
Just give me any old dead shit.
I really don't care.

448
00:26:29,793 --> 00:26:32,069
I want it all in writing,

449
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,049
all of it.

450
00:26:35,632 --> 00:26:36,761
And a conjugal.

451
00:26:37,717 --> 00:26:39,087
I want to see Luann.

452
00:26:40,972 --> 00:26:42,974
I'll try to make that happen.

453
00:26:49,348 --> 00:26:50,348
Okay.

454
00:27:15,858 --> 00:27:17,075
I can stay.

455
00:27:20,034 --> 00:27:21,034
I gotta just...

456
00:27:21,985 --> 00:27:23,728
be okay here, you know?

457
00:27:25,005 --> 00:27:26,005
Yeah.

458
00:27:28,223 --> 00:27:29,920
All right, then I'll go.

459
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:35,031
What would have happened...

460
00:27:37,816 --> 00:27:40,228
if you'd left with me 11 years ago?

461
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:47,448
I don't know, Tara.

462
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,964
What would have
happened if you stayed?

463
00:27:57,077 --> 00:27:59,055
Maybe I wouldn't
have killed someone.

464
00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:00,808
You didn't.

465
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:04,294
You're gonna get past this.

466
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:06,719
It won't feel like this forever.

467
00:28:09,568 --> 00:28:10,723
Honestly, Tara.

468
00:28:13,398 --> 00:28:16,135
Your mom says
that I have to end this.

469
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:20,667
That whatever we're
doing here can't work.

470
00:28:20,787 --> 00:28:21,911
You believe her?

471
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:25,220
What is this?

472
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:30,713
I mean, is it just
about the Kohn thing?

473
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,714
What do you want?

474
00:28:33,226 --> 00:28:36,591
I want you to stop listening
to my crazy mom and get some sleep.

475
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:39,637
We can't keep looking the other way.
We need to think about this.

476
00:28:39,797 --> 00:28:41,499
What the hell are we doing?

477
00:28:47,455 --> 00:28:48,489
Do you love me?

478
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:57,989
It's a simple question, babe.

479
00:29:01,701 --> 00:29:03,870
It's not a simple answer.

480
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:06,846
I know.

481
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,345
All right.

482
00:29:23,021 --> 00:29:24,169
I'm gonna go,

483
00:29:24,906 --> 00:29:25,906
okay?

484
00:29:41,962 --> 00:29:43,973
You ever get high off of this?

485
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,160
- It's just oxygen.
- No, I know,

486
00:29:47,606 --> 00:29:50,859
I know, but can't you
turn it way up and get,

487
00:29:51,661 --> 00:29:53,461
like, a Blue
Velvet kind of thing going on?

488
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:58,864
- What the hell is wrong with him?
- The list is too long, my friend.

489
00:29:59,355 --> 00:30:00,859
Bobby, we should do this.

490
00:30:02,266 --> 00:30:03,504
Listen, Bob.
I'll do it.

491
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:05,140
- What?
- Don't worry. I'll do it.

492
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,451
All right. No.

493
00:30:09,138 --> 00:30:10,770
How's it going?


494
00:30:11,494 --> 00:30:12,718
Look, guys,

495
00:30:13,162 --> 00:30:16,411
last thing I want to do
is start any trouble.

496
00:30:17,007 --> 00:30:20,864
My girl, she's Mexican, too.
These assholes over here at this table,

497
00:30:21,307 --> 00:30:23,783
the shit they're saying about her.

498
00:30:23,943 --> 00:30:25,778
I don't want to bother you fellows,

499
00:30:25,898 --> 00:30:27,961
but I got a daughter at home

500
00:30:28,081 --> 00:30:30,843
just about her age,
and them rednecks over there

501
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:33,668
are saying things about your girl
that are more than rude.

502
00:30:34,231 --> 00:30:37,088
- They are downright disgusting.
- Who said it?!

503
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,038
It's that black-haired prick
right behind me.

504
00:30:59,694 --> 00:31:00,694
Well done.

505
00:31:01,438 --> 00:31:02,827
I do what I can.

506
00:31:05,634 --> 00:31:08,578
Dispatcher's in a separate office.
She won't hear us.

507
00:31:08,738 --> 00:31:11,135
Get to the cells
through the back door.

508
00:31:16,024 --> 00:31:17,128
You here, man?

509
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:18,808
Yeah.

510
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:21,157
That's our cue.

511
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,443
Stay here.
Call if anyone shows up.

512
00:31:34,563 --> 00:31:37,649
- I thought you wanted me...?
- Just keep your eyes open, dude.

513
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:53,540
Holy shit.

514
00:31:57,342 --> 00:32:00,713
- What are you doing here?
- We think the feds are pressing Otto.

515
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:04,039
Something's going on.
They're letting me see him tomorrow.

516
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,802
You got to get a message to him.

517
00:32:05,962 --> 00:32:08,274
They're trying to use
RICO act against the club.

518
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:11,648
You got to tell Otto he can't give
them any info, all right? Nothing...

519
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:14,435
- no matter how small or old.
- Shit.

520
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:17,427
- All right?
- I'll tell him.

521
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:19,849
What are they asking you?

522
00:32:21,157 --> 00:32:23,528
You got to take me with you,
man, please.

523
00:32:23,688 --> 00:32:24,688
I can't.

524
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,906
That bitch wants
to send me back to Nevada.

525
00:32:28,026 --> 00:32:30,930
I'm gonna do hard time
like a hundred goddamn years.

526
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,620
I can't do that.

527
00:32:32,924 --> 00:32:35,671
Your mom's right.
I'll rat if I stay in here.

528
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:37,959
I'll rat!
Come on.

529
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:39,424
Please.

530
00:32:39,544 --> 00:32:41,879
- Please, take me with you...
- All right. Shut up.

531
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:45,751
Come on.

532
00:32:52,964 --> 00:32:56,243
- Where the hell you going with her?
- We got to take this one with us.

533
00:32:56,363 --> 00:32:58,428
You're breaking her out?

534
00:32:58,548 --> 00:33:00,231
Hey, aren't you the police chief?

535
00:33:00,533 --> 00:33:03,274
- I've got no idea what I am anymore.
- He's a friend.

536
00:33:03,394 --> 00:33:05,903
Put her in the van. I'm gonna
check your office, see what I can find.

537
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,679
Come on, little girl,
before something else

538
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,829
bites me in the ass.
It's over there.

539
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,083
God!

540
00:33:31,117 --> 00:33:32,531
Now it's my turn.

541
00:33:37,574 --> 00:33:41,058
I cannot believe we let them
sneak her out under our noses,

542
00:33:41,178 --> 00:33:42,482
while you and I are...

543
00:33:42,882 --> 00:33:45,818
Ease up, sweetheart.
Don't slit your wrists just yet.

544
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,071
Cherry was half your case.

545
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,948
Oakland DA's office
just faxed me these.

546
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:54,263
Turned up an eyewitness
to Hefner's murder; ID'd two guys.

547
00:33:55,259 --> 00:33:58,705
Holy shit. This is Bobby Elvis,
and this looks like Opie.

548
00:33:58,825 --> 00:34:00,712
I sent their mug
shots up this morning.

549
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,427
We should have a positive
ID by this afternoon.

550
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:07,151
Screw the tart.
This gives us our present-day crime.

551
00:34:08,428 --> 00:34:11,469
Now I'm gonna go get me...
some yesterday.

552
00:34:15,885 --> 00:34:18,981
Luann's immunity
and your get-out-of-jail-free card.

553
00:34:20,287 --> 00:34:21,287
You're,

554
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,774
missing a couple of signatures.

555
00:34:26,096 --> 00:34:28,945
Well, I sign off on them
after you hold up your end.

556
00:34:35,468 --> 00:34:38,538
I'm reaching in my pocket,
just a napkin.

557
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:47,380
Big hijack, nine years ago.

558
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,919
Sam Crow, two other charters.

559
00:34:50,902 --> 00:34:53,061
You type it up, I'll sign it.

560
00:34:54,443 --> 00:34:56,389
After you sign off on these.

561
00:34:58,635 --> 00:35:01,878
Luann's freedom now,
yours after you sign.

562
00:35:05,551 --> 00:35:06,679
Fair enough.

563
00:35:07,946 --> 00:35:08,997
Fair enough.

564
00:35:18,313 --> 00:35:20,897
The warden would only
give you ten minutes with her.

565
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:24,965
You do what you want with the time,
but the cameras will be on.

566
00:35:26,037 --> 00:35:27,600
Sorry about that.

567
00:35:34,826 --> 00:35:36,012
Our cargo's doubled.

568
00:35:36,172 --> 00:35:37,943
We got two heading up.

569
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,297
Chief Unser here has been kind
enough to supply us with a truck.

570
00:35:41,687 --> 00:35:45,432
Shipment manifest
for two pallets of electronics,

571
00:35:45,968 --> 00:35:47,189
180 pounds and...

572
00:35:48,027 --> 00:35:49,896
- 98 pounds.
- That ought to get you

573
00:35:50,016 --> 00:35:52,985
and the cargo across
the Canadian border without a stop.

574
00:35:53,105 --> 00:35:54,105
Perfect.

575
00:35:55,169 --> 00:35:56,720
This is my gift to you.

576
00:35:57,496 --> 00:35:59,035
You know my mom's real sick.

577
00:35:59,196 --> 00:36:01,328
- She's in a home in Bakersfield.
- Yeah.

578
00:36:01,645 --> 00:36:04,432
I'm thinking about going Nomad;
I can spend some more time with her.

579
00:36:04,552 --> 00:36:08,002
You know there's always a seat
at the table for you, my brother.

580
00:36:08,479 --> 00:36:09,318
Thank you.

581
00:36:09,438 --> 00:36:11,577
- Absolutely.
- Thanks, Bobby.

582
00:36:11,832 --> 00:36:13,604
You let us know
if your ma needs anything.

583
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,050
Let's move out.

584
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,601
He seems like a nice fellow.

585
00:36:34,997 --> 00:36:38,366
LUANN Jax said ATF
sis using RICO against the club.

586
00:36:39,276 --> 00:36:41,303
Are the feds pressing you to turn...

587
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:43,913
- because of me?
- No, baby.

588
00:36:45,264 --> 00:36:46,926
I took care of it.

589
00:36:47,392 --> 00:36:48,629
I got you clear.

590
00:36:50,483 --> 00:36:51,769
Jesus, Otto

591
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:53,425
did you rat?

592
00:36:55,927 --> 00:36:56,943
If Clay...

593
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:58,814
sees I got out,

594
00:36:58,934 --> 00:37:02,139
he'll know you made some kind of deal,
and you'll know what they'll do to you.

595
00:37:02,299 --> 00:37:03,633
 Don't worry, baby.

596
00:37:04,511 --> 00:37:06,903
I'll get a message to the MC.

597
00:37:08,545 --> 00:37:09,545
Okay?

598
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:13,282
I'm more worried about you.

599
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:16,059
You got to be smart, Luann.

600
00:37:17,721 --> 00:37:19,991
They'll do whatever
they can to hurt us.

601
00:37:39,806 --> 00:37:41,387
Poor Otto...

602
00:37:41,547 --> 00:37:43,201
not even a hand job.

603
00:37:53,845 --> 00:37:55,345
Is there anything else?

604
00:37:57,076 --> 00:37:58,860
No, that's everything.

605
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:00,239
- You sure?
- I swear.

606
00:38:00,481 --> 00:38:01,481
I swear.

607
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:06,537
You know, I don't think I could
ever get used to calling you Rita.

608
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:10,471
I don't want you to.

609
00:38:16,707 --> 00:38:17,719
I'm sorry.

610
00:38:19,818 --> 00:38:21,144
It's all right.

611
00:38:25,935 --> 00:38:27,434
Wrap it up, kids!

612
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:29,512
It's time to go!

613
00:38:40,022 --> 00:38:42,215
I have something I want you to have.

614
00:38:51,301 --> 00:38:52,301
"Cherry."

615
00:38:52,948 --> 00:38:53,948
Cherry.

616
00:38:57,541 --> 00:38:58,798
Don't forget me.

617
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:12,870
I just talked to Smith.

618
00:39:13,454 --> 00:39:15,458
Eyewitness could
only ID Bobby Munson.

619
00:39:15,578 --> 00:39:17,486
Couldn't get a positive on Opie.

620
00:39:18,855 --> 00:39:20,258
Well... after this,

621
00:39:21,029 --> 00:39:22,363
they all go down.

622
00:39:26,426 --> 00:39:28,627
- You're healing nicely.
- Thanks, Doc.

623
00:39:31,894 --> 00:39:34,301
His dressings need
to be changed every day.

624
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:37,545
As long as he doesn't move
around too much, he should be fine.

625
00:39:37,864 --> 00:39:39,020
Thanks.

626
00:39:41,348 --> 00:39:42,664
Did you sleep okay?

627
00:39:50,372 --> 00:39:51,817
Irishman good to go?

628
00:39:58,331 --> 00:39:59,191
Thanks, Doc.

629
00:39:59,671 --> 00:40:01,193
Ready for the road trip, kids?

630
00:40:06,412 --> 00:40:07,547
Just in case.

631
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:11,115
- Be safe.
- Okay.

632
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,978
Let's go, Cammy.

633
00:40:24,263 --> 00:40:25,263
Thank you.

634
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,519
No more burning down shit.

635
00:40:37,178 --> 00:40:38,178
Right.

636
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,641
Let's get you inside.

637
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:54,655
Easy,***

638
00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:28,739
Here is your statement.

639
00:41:30,464 --> 00:41:33,281
You want to make sure
we got it all right, please?

640
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:37,852
I hope you had a nice visit.

641
00:41:38,653 --> 00:41:40,102
I did. Thanks.

642
00:41:41,653 --> 00:41:43,375
You sign, then I'll sign.

643
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,617
Shit.

644
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,619
What's the matter?

645
00:41:48,961 --> 00:41:50,764
I don't have my glasses.

646
00:41:52,034 --> 00:41:54,454
Did I say this was
June or July here?

647
00:41:56,943 --> 00:41:58,310
Looks like July to me...

648
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:02,009
Shit!

649
00:42:20,453 --> 00:42:21,700
Get off me!

650
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,393
Get off me!

651
00:42:35,632 --> 00:42:37,920
I'm burning these assholes. ***
