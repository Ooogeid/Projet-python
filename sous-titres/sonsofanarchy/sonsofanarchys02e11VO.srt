<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,875 --> 00:00:05,880
Clay tried to kill my son.
Slaughtered his wife by mistake.

3
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:07,995
I'm depending on you
to make that right.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,343
Right now it's about protecting Ope.

5
00:00:10,568 --> 00:00:13,012
Killing Donna.
It flipped some switch in you.

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,347
I can do my job.

7
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:17,266
- What do you want?
- I know that you two have history.

8
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,560
He stole your wife,
raised your daughter.

9
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:20,682
You hate him.

10
00:00:20,807 --> 00:00:23,064
The assault charges against the club,
drop 'em.

11
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:26,025
You know,
what you're asking for here is huge.

12
00:00:26,268 --> 00:00:28,235
I'm going to need
some good faith, Chibs.

13
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,487
Irish safe house.

14
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,572
Edmond Hayes. He'll be there.

15
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,699
I'm joing the nomad charter
of the Sons.

16
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,723
Me going nomad,
what's your hit on that?

17
00:00:35,848 --> 00:00:37,703
Way we've been going, makes sense.

18
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:40,373
The night of Bobby's party,
I was attacked.

19
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:43,895
There were three of 'em.
When he spoke, I knew his voice.

20
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,836
Zobelle's right-hand Weston.

21
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:47,088
They raped me,

22
00:00:47,445 --> 00:00:48,547
all three of 'em.

23
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:22,832
I wanted to tell you.

24
00:01:25,883 --> 00:01:28,633
You did the right thing,
keeping her secret.

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,820
You had no choice.

26
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,526
You're going after Zobelle.

27
00:01:39,506 --> 00:01:41,206
I'd do the same for you.

28
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:44,302
You already did.

29
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,739
I can't help but

30
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,670
wondering...

31
00:01:56,008 --> 00:01:57,608
Your dad's manuscript.

32
00:01:58,334 --> 00:02:00,284
Would that be his solution?

33
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,113
More violence?

34
00:02:03,676 --> 00:02:05,426
If Gemma had gotten raped

35
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:07,404
on John's watch...

36
00:02:10,944 --> 00:02:13,544
He'd have written
a whole different book.

37
00:02:22,244 --> 00:02:23,481
It's okay.

38
00:02:32,029 --> 00:02:33,029
Sorry.

39
00:02:34,218 --> 00:02:35,279
I know it's late.

40
00:02:39,347 --> 00:02:40,771
- I'll get him.
- I got it.

41
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:47,071
Come on.

42
00:03:32,354 --> 00:03:33,604
I'm sorry, son.

43
00:03:36,756 --> 00:03:37,756
So am I.

44
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,325
- What they did to your mother...
- I know.

45
00:03:44,235 --> 00:03:45,535
Charges pending.

46
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:47,943
Feds in town.

47
00:03:51,406 --> 00:03:53,656
This retaliation needs to be smart.

48
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:01,923
I can't do it without you.

49
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,529
I'm not going anywhere.

50
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:22,732
How do you want to handle it?

51
00:04:25,694 --> 00:04:26,994
We kill 'em all.

63
00:05:16,257 --> 00:05:20,107
Guessing this has to do with
those patches being back on your cut.

64
00:05:25,262 --> 00:05:26,696
I'm not going nomad.

65
00:05:26,821 --> 00:05:28,577
That's good news, Jackie Boy.

66
00:05:29,935 --> 00:05:31,185
Just listen up.

67
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:37,081
The night of Bobby's party...

68
00:05:39,324 --> 00:05:42,383
Gemma never drove into no barricade.
She was jumped...

69
00:05:42,963 --> 00:05:43,963
on 18.

70
00:05:44,607 --> 00:05:47,554
They took her to the utility house.
Three of Zobelle's crew.

71
00:05:47,997 --> 00:05:50,597
And they gave her
a message to deliver...

72
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,470
Stop selling guns.

73
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:08,133
They raped her.

74
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,515
- What?
- Jesus.

75
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:14,453
God.

76
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:16,500
Jesus, Clay.

77
00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:19,173
I'm so sorry.

78
00:06:22,823 --> 00:06:24,423
One of 'em was Weston.

79
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:28,679
- What do we do?
- We get bloody

80
00:06:30,086 --> 00:06:31,960
and then we chop
their goddamn heads off.

81
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:33,135
That is it.

82
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:46,144
We ain't ever seen
an assault like this,

83
00:06:48,221 --> 00:06:50,868
and as much as I would like
to cut their hearts out,

84
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:55,205
a show of force
just puts us back in jail.

85
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,007
We got to do
what they've been doing.

86
00:06:58,132 --> 00:06:59,932
You know, find a weakness,

87
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:03,285
- unravel 'em.
- And until then, nobody reacts.

88
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:08,132
You see Zobelle, you see Weston,
you see any of the crew, you...

89
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:11,869
You swallow the urge to kill them
and then you walk on.

90
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,183
Understood?

91
00:07:19,385 --> 00:07:21,785
We got to get our hands
on some guns.

92
00:07:22,154 --> 00:07:23,227
Cupboard is bare.

93
00:07:23,352 --> 00:07:26,087
Chinese gun source is laying low
since the immigration snafu.

94
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,820
It's going to be weeks

95
00:07:27,945 --> 00:07:29,573
before we see any of that shit.

96
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:32,907
We got to tap our personal stock.

97
00:07:33,798 --> 00:07:34,627
All right.

98
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:36,802
Everyone bring in what you got.

99
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,431
It's open.

100
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:53,237
Morning.

101
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,260
Doing okay?

102
00:08:03,176 --> 00:08:04,176
Sure.

103
00:08:08,024 --> 00:08:09,174
It was brave,

104
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,770
doing what you did.

105
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,530
Had to be done.

106
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,720
Snap Jax and Clay
out of their bullshit.

107
00:08:22,446 --> 00:08:24,096
Had to be done for you.

108
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:27,589
Do you want to talk about it?

109
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:31,018
There's nothing to talk about.

110
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:37,599
Clay is never going to want

111
00:08:37,724 --> 00:08:40,924
to be inside something
that's been ripped up like me.

112
00:08:42,445 --> 00:08:44,695
Jesus Christ, Gemma. Clay loves you.

113
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,370
Love don't mean shit.

114
00:08:51,258 --> 00:08:53,158
Men need to own their pussy.

115
00:08:55,062 --> 00:08:56,662
His has been violated.

116
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:01,688
He'll find another.

117
00:09:05,573 --> 00:09:06,973
It's what they do.

118
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:30,371
Jesus. I thought you were at work.

119
00:09:31,382 --> 00:09:33,113
I have that vacation time.

120
00:09:34,394 --> 00:09:35,394
Right.

121
00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:38,471
Shit, I'm sorry we can't go.

122
00:09:38,596 --> 00:09:40,495
- Of course, I know.
- Did you see my mom?

123
00:09:42,946 --> 00:09:44,396
She's kind of numb.

124
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,560
Maybe you could keep
an eye on her today.

125
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,030
I love you.

126
00:09:57,554 --> 00:09:58,854
I love you, too.

127
00:10:10,946 --> 00:10:13,046
I got suspended

128
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:14,238
from St. Thomas.

129
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,515
They figured out what I did for Chibs.
There's a hearing in two weeks.

130
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,790
Jesus Christ.

131
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:24,948
What does that mean?

132
00:10:25,073 --> 00:10:27,573
Worst-case scenario:
I lose my license.

133
00:10:28,623 --> 00:10:32,027
Best-case: a black mark
that follows me my whole career.

134
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,468
I wasn't going to tell you.
It's the last thing you need

135
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,687
with everything that's been going on,
but I just...

136
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:41,932
I don't want any more secrets, Jax.

137
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:43,759
It's okay.

138
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:47,133
We'll get through it

139
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:48,855
just like everything else.

140
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:01,368
You know it would kill me

141
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,079
if I knew you were sleeping
with other women.

142
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:06,696
What?

143
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:11,134
Cheating. That's a...
It's a deal breaker for me,

144
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,321
and at some point,

145
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:16,561
playing house
isn't going to be enough.

146
00:11:16,838 --> 00:11:19,761
- Tara, can we can talk about this...?
- I'm going to want a baby, or two.

147
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,531
And I need to know
that whatever this is,

148
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:24,349
it's heading in that direction.

149
00:11:25,883 --> 00:11:27,283
I know. I'm sorry.

150
00:11:27,775 --> 00:11:30,075
I just... I need to say all of that.

151
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,860
Probably should have done it
in smaller doses.

152
00:11:37,508 --> 00:11:40,408
I haven't been with anyone
since this became...

153
00:11:41,073 --> 00:11:42,423
Whatever this is.

154
00:11:44,151 --> 00:11:46,307
And I wouldn't have told you
all the shit that I have

155
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:49,666
if I didn't think
this was moving towards something more.

156
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,014
It's all right. Come here.

157
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:13,598
You want some orange juice
with that?

158
00:12:13,821 --> 00:12:14,821
Sorry.

159
00:12:15,473 --> 00:12:16,673
Helped myself.

160
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:23,206
Been a rough morning.

161
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,510
You need anything, you let us know.

162
00:12:37,947 --> 00:12:39,247
What's all this?

163
00:12:39,998 --> 00:12:41,927
Chinese contact didn't pan out.

164
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,195
We're collecting personal stock.

165
00:12:48,457 --> 00:12:50,457
- I'll get mine.
- All right.

166
00:12:58,848 --> 00:12:59,848
I got it.

167
00:13:11,386 --> 00:13:12,486
I'll get it.

168
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:15,325
Sorry.

169
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:23,504
What the hell are we doing?

170
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:54,317
Looks sweet, Ope.

171
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:57,643
Done a great job
restoring that bad boy.

172
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:02,754
Need a hand?

173
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,819
No, I'm all good.

174
00:15:08,957 --> 00:15:09,957
All right.

175
00:15:13,642 --> 00:15:15,660
Awful thing. Gemma.

176
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:21,586
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

177
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,520
Can I ask you a question, Opie?

178
00:15:28,645 --> 00:15:29,757
What's that?

179
00:15:31,343 --> 00:15:33,443
The night that Donna was killed,

180
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:36,560
why was she driving the truck?

181
00:15:39,794 --> 00:15:42,544
I was taking the kids home.
Need a backseat.

182
00:15:43,656 --> 00:15:45,485
Why are you asking me that?

183
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,825
She wasn't
supposed to be in the truck, Ope.

184
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,121
You son of a bitch.

185
00:16:05,604 --> 00:16:07,716
What did you do?

186
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,743
It was Stahl, Ope.

187
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,430
She made you a rat.

188
00:16:12,185 --> 00:16:13,780
She's the one who killed Donna.

189
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:15,719
Me and Clay,
we didn't want to believe it.

190
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:16,994
I came clean.

191
00:16:17,594 --> 00:16:19,144
Clay and I were good!

192
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,145
Found wiretaps
in your truck and your phone.

193
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,608
The feds put money in your accounts.

194
00:16:24,957 --> 00:16:27,694
Stahl, she wanted to make us think
that you had turned.

195
00:16:28,094 --> 00:16:31,315
It was supposed to be you in the truck,
not Donna.

196
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:35,827
I'm sorry, Ope. I'm so sorry.

197
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:42,057
What the hell happened?

198
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,917
Call Tara. She's at my house.

199
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,293
What the hell did you say to him?

200
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:55,462
Tell us!

201
00:16:55,984 --> 00:16:58,534
I don't even know
who I am anymore, man.

202
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,537
- What are you talking about?
- I had to tell him.

203
00:17:01,662 --> 00:17:03,980
- Tell him what?
- That I killed Donna.

204
00:17:07,031 --> 00:17:08,181
Jesus Christ.

205
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,180
It was Stahl's fault. Opie knows.

206
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,783
Opie knows what?

207
00:17:15,593 --> 00:17:17,869
Stahl is the one
who really killed Donna.

208
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:21,993
He's going after Stahl.

209
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:19,055
- Where's ATF?
- They left a little while ago. Why?

210
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:21,202
Opie got wind
of what happened to Donna.

211
00:18:21,327 --> 00:18:23,077
He's putting it on Stahl.

212
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:27,649
I just saw Opie's truck on the street.
He's probably tailing her.

213
00:18:28,265 --> 00:18:30,608
- I got to stop him.
- I'll call Stahl.

214
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,576
I'm going to give her a heads-up.
Put an ATL out on Ope.

215
00:18:33,701 --> 00:18:35,363
Any idea where she's headed?

216
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:37,814
She said she's got a buyer
that's willing to turn on the IRA.

217
00:18:37,939 --> 00:18:40,014
It's probably someone
from Zobelle's crew.

218
00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:41,874
They're the only ones buying guns.

219
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:43,899
All right. I'll start there.

220
00:18:49,018 --> 00:18:50,818
I'm guessing Jax told you.

221
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,830
Crew found out about Gemma.

222
00:18:55,485 --> 00:18:56,384
The rape.

223
00:18:57,358 --> 00:18:58,781
Jesus Christ.

224
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:02,015
Made a decision to do right by her.

225
00:19:03,237 --> 00:19:06,337
Wherever this leads,
whatever I got to do for them,

226
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:08,273
it's on me only.

227
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,101
You're going to protect Sam Crow?

228
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:14,389
I'm going to help a friend.

229
00:19:14,514 --> 00:19:16,814
Now, you do whatever you need to do.

230
00:19:17,045 --> 00:19:18,187
Understand?

231
00:19:19,734 --> 00:19:21,084
Consider yourself

232
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:22,976
acting chief.

233
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:27,595
What do I do?

234
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:29,139
I know

235
00:19:29,462 --> 00:19:31,920
sometimes you got
to make executive decisions.

236
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,086
I get it. You earned that power.

237
00:19:34,211 --> 00:19:36,946
But word gets out to our crew,

238
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,869
other charters,

239
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:42,495
that one of the founding nine
put out a hit

240
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,983
that landed on the wife of a member.

241
00:19:47,502 --> 00:19:49,812
That is some very bad PR, brother.

242
00:19:52,673 --> 00:19:54,864
We got to keep this
to the few who know.

243
00:19:54,989 --> 00:19:57,195
So, how do we convince Opie of that?

244
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,302
He's in the apartment.

245
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,808
Thanks, doc.

246
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,091
- Do I ask?
- Just a scuffle.

247
00:20:18,657 --> 00:20:20,007
Me and a brother.

248
00:20:24,113 --> 00:20:25,826
Clean out the scrapes on your hands.

249
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:27,603
All right. Thanks, doc.

250
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:33,492
You okay?

251
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,317
Think something may be going
on with the implant.

252
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,485
Going on?

253
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,988
Can I show you?

254
00:20:45,294 --> 00:20:46,439
My god!

255
00:20:46,734 --> 00:20:48,034
It's bad, right?

256
00:20:48,175 --> 00:20:51,475
That's very, very infected, half...

257
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,684
You have to get to an ER now.

258
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:57,964
Holy mary of balls.

259
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,045
Shit.
You got kind of like

260
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,645
elephant nuts.

261
00:21:11,749 --> 00:21:14,199
Figured you'd show up
sooner or later.

262
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,860
Sorry.

263
00:21:18,163 --> 00:21:20,763
Me being there
wasn't doing him any good.

264
00:21:21,284 --> 00:21:22,906
Ope needs to be a dad.

265
00:21:23,392 --> 00:21:25,992
You know,
I don't give a shit about that.

266
00:21:26,534 --> 00:21:27,884
What do you want?

267
00:21:31,445 --> 00:21:33,127
The broads and...

268
00:21:34,725 --> 00:21:36,336
My drinking...

269
00:21:37,012 --> 00:21:38,517
I never really gave you...

270
00:21:38,642 --> 00:21:41,633
A chance to be a good wife or a mom.

271
00:21:42,238 --> 00:21:44,638
Mistakes Opie made,
they're my fault.

272
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,939
What the hell is going on?

273
00:21:48,085 --> 00:21:50,141
You got the cancer or something?

274
00:22:01,756 --> 00:22:03,506
You take care, beautiful.

275
00:22:17,204 --> 00:22:20,383
- Call me after the pickup.
- Where you headed?

276
00:22:20,508 --> 00:22:22,923
Ule and I have a meeting
at the church.

277
00:22:23,048 --> 00:22:24,848
Need me to come by afterwards?

278
00:22:24,973 --> 00:22:26,673
Think we got it covered.

279
00:23:00,636 --> 00:23:01,636
This is...

280
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:03,466
everyone's personal stock.

281
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:06,689
Zobelle's got enough automatic weapons
to suppress a third world coup.

282
00:23:06,814 --> 00:23:09,243
We can't go at him with handguns

283
00:23:09,528 --> 00:23:12,078
and a couple of AK's
and hunting rifles.

284
00:23:12,249 --> 00:23:14,142
We're gonna have to reach out
to Jimmy.

285
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:17,829
We gotta repair our relationship
with the irish.

286
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,523
- What about Chibs?
- Chibs is gonna have to understand.

287
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:23,404
Everybody's gonna have
to make sacrifices.

288
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,483
This is for Gemma.

289
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,117
In exchange for cooperating
in the arrest of James O'Phelan,

290
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:34,191
we will provide
immunity for your wife,

291
00:23:34,316 --> 00:23:36,205
and protection for her
and your daughter.

292
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,334
You will be registered
as a confidential informant

293
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:42,128
for the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.

294
00:23:42,493 --> 00:23:44,698
Deal was for Fiona, Kerrianne,

295
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,507
immunity for Sam Crow.

296
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,881
Immunity from the IRA connection
I can guarantee,

297
00:23:50,006 --> 00:23:51,690
but the DA's office in San Joaquin

298
00:23:51,815 --> 00:23:53,943
hasn't even put together
the assault case yet.

299
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:55,892
- I cannot make that deal.
- Bullshit.

300
00:23:56,153 --> 00:23:58,895
I've given you Edmond
and now you're dicking me around?

301
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,066
I figured you wouldn't want to wait,

302
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,900
- risk your family's safety.
- You promised all of it.

303
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,340
I'm not giving you nothing
until you make it happen.

304
00:24:09,553 --> 00:24:12,942
Edmond already gave up his old man.
That streak runs in the family,

305
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:15,894
it means that Cameron's gonna crack
and turn on Jimmy O.

306
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:20,023
If Jimmy O figures out that you're
the one who got the ball rolling,

307
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,210
there's no telling
what he would do to your family.

308
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:27,173
I'm gonna kill you,
you filthy whore.

309
00:24:31,084 --> 00:24:32,592
I'll tell you what.

310
00:24:33,801 --> 00:24:35,056
You look this over.

311
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:37,809
Sign it before I leave here today or

312
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,655
Fiona and your kid

313
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,398
are in the wind.

314
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,699
Let him go.

315
00:24:56,644 --> 00:24:58,350
Shit. Chibs.

316
00:25:36,403 --> 00:25:38,303
Holy shit.

317
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:42,915
Now you know my heroin is good.
What's your business proposal?

318
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,803
It's simple and lucrative, Marcus.

319
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,418
I provide you with unlimited
heroin distribution

320
00:25:48,543 --> 00:25:51,188
to every prison
in Northern California.

321
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,676
Mule Creek to Pelican Bay.

322
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:57,644
By my estimation, that'll more
than triple your current business.

323
00:25:57,963 --> 00:26:01,967
- And what's your take on all this?
- I split the prison profits, 50-50.

324
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,260
Half?

325
00:26:04,527 --> 00:26:06,063
That's my heroin, <i>ese</i>.

326
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:09,734
And it's my pipeline, friend.

327
00:26:16,481 --> 00:26:18,534
- If I say no?
- You're a smart man.

328
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:20,500
You know what happens then.

329
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:23,267
Not only
does this opportunity vanish,

330
00:26:23,571 --> 00:26:25,578
but so do my weapons.

331
00:26:25,862 --> 00:26:28,586
You lose ground to black and yellow.

332
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:31,825
Before long,
you're in third place again.

333
00:26:39,692 --> 00:26:41,605
That's your share of the profit

334
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,059
from this order.

335
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:46,127
He's gonna make the same pickup
every ten days.

336
00:26:48,491 --> 00:26:50,241
I'll see you in ten days.

337
00:26:50,582 --> 00:26:51,582
Friend.

338
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,557
That's the four dozen AK's.

339
00:27:24,287 --> 00:27:24,982
Good.

340
00:27:25,107 --> 00:27:28,354
We hit an inventory snag.
This may be the last shipment.

341
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:31,983
- What're you talking about?
- Our russian pipeline's dried up.

342
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,671
Zobelle's gonna be pissed.

343
00:27:33,796 --> 00:27:36,155
I'll give you a call
when I know more.

344
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,380
Sorry, boys.

345
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,439
Put a tail on Cameron.

346
00:28:19,354 --> 00:28:22,241
Yeah, agent Stahl returning
deputy chief Hale's call.

347
00:28:26,243 --> 00:28:27,455
Get out.

348
00:28:32,614 --> 00:28:34,962
Look, I'm not sure what this is about,
Ope, but whatever it is,

349
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,080
- this is not the way to handle this.
- Shut up.

350
00:28:42,464 --> 00:28:44,013
You gonna kill me?

351
00:28:48,747 --> 00:28:52,697
- You found out something about Donna...
- Don't you talk about her!

352
00:28:56,338 --> 00:28:58,088
What do you want from me?

353
00:28:59,188 --> 00:29:00,821
I want you to feel

354
00:29:01,468 --> 00:29:02,735
what I feel.

355
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,779
I never thought that you
or your family would get hurt, Opie.

356
00:29:06,904 --> 00:29:09,722
I underestimated Clay's capacity
for vengeance.

357
00:29:09,847 --> 00:29:12,114
Don't you dare try
and pass the blame.

358
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:14,865
I'll take my share of the guilt, okay?
It comes with the territory.

359
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,936
Donna was a beautiful woman.

360
00:29:19,145 --> 00:29:22,845
She was a wonderful mother.
She was an innocent in all of this.

361
00:29:33,562 --> 00:29:35,112
The outlaw had mercy.

362
00:29:37,282 --> 00:29:41,286
You remember that the next time you try
and twist the truth to kill one of us.

363
00:30:11,092 --> 00:30:12,893
Can I bum one of those?

364
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:16,858
Sure.

365
00:30:27,444 --> 00:30:28,444
Thanks.

366
00:30:31,003 --> 00:30:31,996
Francis.

367
00:30:37,263 --> 00:30:38,736
This your parish?

368
00:30:40,553 --> 00:30:42,203
You here for a meeting?

369
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,944
I'm not sure.

370
00:30:49,972 --> 00:30:51,472
Took me three months

371
00:30:52,354 --> 00:30:54,810
before I could actually
walk through the door.

372
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:57,772
Heroin.

373
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,930
Clean 21 years.

374
00:31:03,244 --> 00:31:04,394
Good for you.

375
00:31:06,518 --> 00:31:07,823
Good for everyone else, too.

376
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:15,984
Can I ask you question?

377
00:31:23,151 --> 00:31:24,251
You think...

378
00:31:27,717 --> 00:31:29,974
You think God forgives you
for doing...

379
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:31,149
bad things?

380
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:35,768
I mean, like...

381
00:31:37,918 --> 00:31:38,918
Really...

382
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,340
bad shit.

383
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:45,894
God forgives absolutely.

384
00:31:47,622 --> 00:31:49,323
We're the ones who usually can't.

385
00:31:51,837 --> 00:31:52,887
I get that.

386
00:31:56,061 --> 00:31:58,761
Took me a long time
to let go of all the...

387
00:31:59,593 --> 00:32:01,488
wreckage I created.

388
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:04,503
That's why I do what I do.

389
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,841
Service to others is the only thing

390
00:32:09,692 --> 00:32:11,742
that keeps the self-loathing...

391
00:32:13,573 --> 00:32:14,890
to a tolerable level.

392
00:32:16,948 --> 00:32:19,748
I'm not sure how much service
I am to anyone.

393
00:32:20,135 --> 00:32:22,135
You're being of service to me.

394
00:32:22,578 --> 00:32:23,578
Smoke,

395
00:32:23,931 --> 00:32:25,531
relevant conversation.

396
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:27,620
Highlight of my day.

397
00:32:30,995 --> 00:32:33,195
Look for the opportunities, Gemma.

398
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,691
God puts them before us
all the time.

399
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:43,867
It was nice meeting you.

400
00:32:44,873 --> 00:32:45,873
Same.

401
00:32:58,052 --> 00:32:59,643
I've been looking for you.

402
00:33:03,405 --> 00:33:04,805
I didn't kill her.

403
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,246
The rift between you and Clay...

404
00:33:19,693 --> 00:33:21,993
You knew about Donna the whole time.

405
00:33:25,584 --> 00:33:27,334
I couldn't tell you, man.

406
00:33:30,238 --> 00:33:32,458
Her getting killed was bad enough.

407
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:33,833
Knowing this...

408
00:33:38,192 --> 00:33:39,592
What do I do, Jax?

409
00:33:44,743 --> 00:33:47,775
How the hell am I supposed
to share a patch with them?

410
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,154
Burden lands on the club, Ope.

411
00:33:53,675 --> 00:33:55,005
We both know it.

412
00:33:57,111 --> 00:33:59,376
Clay is Clay because of us.

413
00:33:59,692 --> 00:34:00,792
We made him.

414
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:06,436
Then, how do we unmake him?

415
00:34:12,475 --> 00:34:14,775
I've been trying to figure that out.

416
00:34:16,474 --> 00:34:19,890
But the one thing I know for sure
is I can't do this alone.

417
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:22,393
I need you, bro.

418
00:34:27,908 --> 00:34:29,844
I'm here, man.

419
00:34:39,867 --> 00:34:40,995
What?

420
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:44,954
I got something I want you to read.

421
00:34:47,033 --> 00:34:48,320
Cameron panicked.

422
00:34:48,445 --> 00:34:50,628
Boy gets a little twitchy
if he smells a fed.

423
00:34:50,753 --> 00:34:52,840
I had no idea he changed alliances.

424
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,026
Bullshit.

425
00:34:56,071 --> 00:34:58,716
I'm really trying hard
to be diplomatic here.

426
00:34:58,841 --> 00:35:01,941
Well, you can't really
blame Chibs for being irked.

427
00:35:02,592 --> 00:35:05,686
You get in bed with the scumbag
blew him up, nearly killed him.

428
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,389
You can't kill Filip.

429
00:35:07,514 --> 00:35:08,514
Trust me,

430
00:35:09,196 --> 00:35:10,914
- I tried.
- Wanna try again?

431
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:12,041
Enough.

432
00:35:17,161 --> 00:35:19,341
Make one more comment
like that, Jimmy,

433
00:35:19,466 --> 00:35:21,469
and not only do we not
get back into business,

434
00:35:21,594 --> 00:35:25,294
but I call McGee in Belfast
and I pull all of the sons support.

435
00:35:26,443 --> 00:35:27,953
I was out of line.

436
00:35:28,078 --> 00:35:29,043
Apologies.

437
00:35:29,565 --> 00:35:31,187
20 years working together.

438
00:35:31,312 --> 00:35:32,836
Let's not ruin a good thing.

439
00:35:32,961 --> 00:35:35,170
No more guns to white power.

440
00:35:35,981 --> 00:35:37,381
It's already dead.

441
00:35:39,252 --> 00:35:40,957
We keep running
your guns up the coast

442
00:35:41,082 --> 00:35:43,080
and you keep supplying us
with the russian stock.

443
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:45,105
And I mean, I need some now.

444
00:35:45,405 --> 00:35:46,405
Done.

445
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,695
I'll give you Zobelle's
next shipment gratis.

446
00:35:49,961 --> 00:35:51,899
We'll call it reparations.

447
00:35:57,535 --> 00:35:58,706
Fair enough.

448
00:37:02,684 --> 00:37:03,773
This...

449
00:37:05,907 --> 00:37:07,641
This club...

450
00:37:09,365 --> 00:37:12,557
This club killed my wife.

451
00:37:20,797 --> 00:37:23,323
How does that ever get made right?

452
00:37:27,601 --> 00:37:29,349
We wanna fix this, Ope.

453
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:33,428
Me, too.

454
00:37:35,037 --> 00:37:36,687
That's why I'm staying.

455
00:37:37,953 --> 00:37:38,953
Good.

456
00:37:39,696 --> 00:37:40,696
That's...

457
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,092
Real good.

458
00:37:43,217 --> 00:37:45,817
I don't want anybody
knowing my business.

459
00:37:47,528 --> 00:37:49,423
Doesn't help me, my family

460
00:37:49,548 --> 00:37:51,268
or Sam Crow that this gets out.

461
00:37:51,586 --> 00:37:52,786
This secret...

462
00:37:53,975 --> 00:37:54,813
Dies here.

463
00:37:55,385 --> 00:37:56,968
Understood.

464
00:38:01,892 --> 00:38:03,363
Anything else?

465
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:08,267
When I went looking for stahl...

466
00:38:10,776 --> 00:38:11,826
I saw chibs

467
00:38:12,108 --> 00:38:14,041
coming out of her office
with paperwork.

468
00:38:14,574 --> 00:38:15,415
Goddamn it.

469
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,540
What?

470
00:38:16,986 --> 00:38:18,736
You need to hear him out.

471
00:38:18,889 --> 00:38:19,796
Get the truth.

472
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:22,019
And trust what he says.

473
00:38:41,026 --> 00:38:42,352
Darling.

474
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:44,573
You okay?

475
00:38:45,847 --> 00:38:46,847
Your head?

476
00:38:48,956 --> 00:38:50,187
It's fine.

477
00:38:50,312 --> 00:38:52,120
Just everything else is shit.

478
00:39:12,604 --> 00:39:13,767
What's going on, honey?

479
00:39:15,702 --> 00:39:16,852
I don't know.

480
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:26,227
Ever done something
that just made you feel wretched?

481
00:39:27,305 --> 00:39:29,282
Protecting someone you love?

482
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:33,303
More than once.

483
00:39:39,842 --> 00:39:40,992
Sweetheart...

484
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,648
I've dug myself a good one.

485
00:39:57,491 --> 00:39:59,591
I've got no idea how to get out.

486
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,018
Sweetheart.

487
00:40:04,087 --> 00:40:05,087
It's okay.

488
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:08,507
It's okay, honey.

489
00:40:17,356 --> 00:40:18,506
What do I do?

490
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:22,837
You tell 'em.

491
00:40:24,897 --> 00:40:26,147
Whatever it is.

492
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:31,130
It's the only way
out of the hole, baby.

493
00:40:37,895 --> 00:40:39,345
You know something?

494
00:40:39,472 --> 00:40:41,922
I don't know
what we'd do without you.

495
00:40:42,091 --> 00:40:43,191
We love you.

496
00:40:50,005 --> 00:40:52,308
Zobelle in bed with the Mayans?

497
00:40:52,697 --> 00:40:54,117
It was a buy or a trade.

498
00:40:54,643 --> 00:40:57,100
Alvarez's only commodity is heroin.

499
00:40:57,347 --> 00:40:59,900
- What's Zobelle want with heroin?
- It's the missing piece.

500
00:41:00,025 --> 00:41:01,242
Think about it.

501
00:41:01,367 --> 00:41:03,467
This was never about a race war.

502
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:06,129
The guns are about controlling
the H traffic.

503
00:41:06,434 --> 00:41:09,930
Feeding the mayans weapons
so white can control the heroin trade.

504
00:41:10,055 --> 00:41:11,162
How's that work?

505
00:41:11,287 --> 00:41:13,595
Weston and his guys
are hardcore color haters.

506
00:41:13,911 --> 00:41:15,975
That's why Weston
wasn't at the heroin deal.

507
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,059
So, Zobelle's doing all this behind
his lieutenant's back.

508
00:41:19,617 --> 00:41:20,617
Judas.

509
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,614
Sounds like
something we can unravel.

510
00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:24,789
Absolutely.

511
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,010
Can I have a minute, boys?

512
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:55,512
Stahl played my hate for Jimmy O,

513
00:41:55,885 --> 00:41:59,002
and I told her I'd give him up
for Fiona and Kerrianne's safety

514
00:41:59,127 --> 00:42:00,725
and immunity for the club.

515
00:42:03,475 --> 00:42:05,125
I didn't make the deal,

516
00:42:06,454 --> 00:42:08,900
but I guess Edmond
turned on his old man.

517
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,437
And if cameron gives up Jimmy,

518
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,198
Stahl's threatened to tell him
I put the whole thing in motion.

519
00:42:16,109 --> 00:42:18,633
Jimmy'll kill both of 'em
to hurt me.

520
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:23,806
I'm sorry, boys.

521
00:42:32,292 --> 00:42:34,042
You didn't make the deal.

522
00:42:34,194 --> 00:42:35,544
You ain't no rat.

523
00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:38,937
We'll figure out a way to make
this thing right with Jimmy, so...

524
00:42:39,062 --> 00:42:42,100
We're not gonna let anything
happen to your family.

525
00:42:46,803 --> 00:42:48,303
Thank you, brothers.

526
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:50,363
You son of a bitch.

527
00:42:54,132 --> 00:42:55,697
Get the goddamn gun off.

528
00:43:04,681 --> 00:43:06,708
- You okay?
- I'm all right.

529
00:43:10,819 --> 00:43:12,169
Give me the room!

530
00:43:15,248 --> 00:43:16,598
Give me the room.

531
00:43:41,997 --> 00:43:43,547
He's a crazy old man.

532
00:43:44,156 --> 00:43:46,706
You got every right
to make him go away.

533
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:50,108
This was about protecting me.

534
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:53,260
He was afraid I was gonna kill you.

535
00:43:54,638 --> 00:43:57,188
He didn't want for me
to take that fall.

536
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:01,385
Probably some truth to that fear.

537
00:44:07,355 --> 00:44:08,355
And now?

538
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,464
And now I'm asking
for you to give my old man a break.

539
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:15,489
He's dead without this club.

540
00:44:23,164 --> 00:44:24,314
Go home, Pop.

541
00:44:33,968 --> 00:44:36,518
Let me know
how you want to handle this.

542
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:38,108
Old man?

543
00:44:41,107 --> 00:44:44,055
Don't ever come into this clubhouse
without your cut.

544
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,550
It won't happen again.

545
00:45:03,292 --> 00:45:05,857
Be good to 'em, girls.
It's been a long day.

546
00:45:05,982 --> 00:45:07,482
She's in the office.

547
00:45:15,419 --> 00:45:17,819
She needs to know
you still love her.

548
00:45:19,756 --> 00:45:21,479
What are you talking about?

549
00:45:21,604 --> 00:45:23,386
Thing that's causing her
the most pain

550
00:45:24,066 --> 00:45:26,566
is thinking
you don't want her anymore.

551
00:45:31,858 --> 00:45:34,023
I'll always have your back, brother.

552
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,198
I love you.

553
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:53,458
Let's go home.

554
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,701
Honey, I should catch up.
We'll be buried.

555
00:45:58,122 --> 00:45:59,122
Fine.

556
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,931
What the hell's the matter with you?

557
00:46:11,354 --> 00:46:12,756
I want my wife.

558
00:46:39,003 --> 00:46:43,007
