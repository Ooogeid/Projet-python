2
00:00:03,858 --> 00:00:05,716
Found a box in the storage unit.

3
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:07,992
Just, like, pictures and journals,

4
00:00:08,112 --> 00:00:10,846
things I never knew about him.
When you and Dad hooked up,

5
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,489
he {\ever }talk to you
about his vision,

6
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:15,684
- about what he wanted from the club?
- Jax is going through some shit.

7
00:00:15,846 --> 00:00:18,232
He's asking me if John wanted
to get into running guns?

8
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,314
Tonight he said that maybe
we shouldn't rebuild the factory.

9
00:00:21,434 --> 00:00:25,341
I want to make sure he's following
in the right father's footsteps.

10
00:00:38,114 --> 00:00:39,735
Let's go into the photo booth.

11
00:00:39,855 --> 00:00:42,052
Come on,
let me give you a quick hand job.

12
00:00:42,172 --> 00:00:43,803
I already got a picture of that.

13
00:00:43,923 --> 00:00:45,673
This time it'll bemy hand.

14
00:00:50,046 --> 00:00:51,496
You been a bad girl.

15
00:00:56,053 --> 00:00:57,075
Hey, Clay.

16
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,998
- How you doing, Elliot?
- Okay, Clay.

17
00:01:00,486 --> 00:01:01,486
Karen.

18
00:01:02,444 --> 00:01:04,264
Mom, I'm gonna go
on the Spin-Out again.

19
00:01:04,384 --> 00:01:06,444
- {\Tristen,}You've been on it four times already.
- I know.

20
00:01:08,142 --> 00:01:09,002
Here.

21
00:01:09,122 --> 00:01:11,240
- That's not necessary.
- That's all right.

22
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:14,243
They kicked me off
'cause I was screaming too loud.

23
00:01:14,846 --> 00:01:15,812
What do you say?

24
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:18,356
- Thanks.
- You got it.

25
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:21,475
We gotta go.

26
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:22,751
Bye.

27
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:24,045
- Come on.
- Come on.

28
00:01:27,306 --> 00:01:29,344
Man, you'd think with all that money

29
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:33,270
they could pay someone to remove
those sticks shoved up their asses.

30
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,557
Maybe he's just a little paranoid
some of his country club cronies

31
00:01:36,718 --> 00:01:39,290
are gonna see him talking
to the outlaw.

32
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:40,994
Come on.

33
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:43,120
I need to talk to the outlaw.

34
00:01:59,616 --> 00:02:01,842
Your daddy throws like your mommy.

35
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:04,376
He wear a bra and panties
to your games?

36
00:02:04,732 --> 00:02:08,363
Come on, try it again, hot shot.
Come on. Where are you going?

37
00:02:08,483 --> 00:02:11,833
Five more bucks,
your son'll be convinced you're a loser.

38
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:14,366
Darby's guys?

39
00:02:14,486 --> 00:02:16,136
I don't recognize them.

40
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,596
Look at the big, bad bikers.

41
00:02:20,148 --> 00:02:21,686
Gonna get Clowny all wet, huh?

42
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,623
Hey, you guys, come on. Let's go!

43
00:02:25,743 --> 00:02:28,335
- Come on, Jax. Come on.
- Hey, let's go!

44
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,444
What's a matter, tough guy?

45
00:02:30,773 --> 00:02:33,023
Can't put the little ball
in the tight hole?

46
00:02:33,143 --> 00:02:35,993
Bet all your leather-wearing
butt buddies say the same thing.

47
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:37,278
That's a Bozo no-no.

48
00:02:37,398 --> 00:02:40,014
Jesus, you guys.
All right, man. Come on!

49
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:43,160
Smile boy. You're going down.

50
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:49,926
- Got that cotton candy?
- Yeah.

51
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:51,377
- Nice.
- There you go.

52
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:53,280
Thank you very much, man.

53
00:02:58,068 --> 00:02:59,591
I can barely see it.

54
00:03:01,144 --> 00:03:02,144
Gimme that.

55
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:07,066
The Irish are coming.

56
00:03:07,618 --> 00:03:09,608
- Go find the others.
- Okay.

57
00:03:11,146 --> 00:03:12,215
Sorry, baby.

58
00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:13,483
I might have to...

59
00:03:13,603 --> 00:03:16,024
- finish you off later.
- I heard that before.

60
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:18,784
Gimme some more quarters.
I'm going back in the booth.

61
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,457
Think the prospect's deep enough?

62
00:03:28,122 --> 00:03:30,752
May only have one nut,
but it's a big one.

63
00:03:30,872 --> 00:03:32,972
- I trust him.
- Hey, prospect!

64
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:37,012
Come on over here. Learn a thing.

65
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:38,163
Hurry up.

66
00:03:39,948 --> 00:03:41,145
Don't get hit.

67
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:54,276
- Don't screw this up, Sack.
- Good to see you, Michael.

68
00:03:55,896 --> 00:03:57,650
Why'd you bring the ladies here?

69
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,935
Russian ladies.

70
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:00,293
.62s and AKs.

71
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:02,734
Fresh from the Kremlin.

72
00:04:18,465 --> 00:04:19,897
Got all the parts.

73
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,306
A couple of assembled samples.

74
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:25,664
- Got some Russky iron.
- AKs?

75
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,784
God bless Gorbachev.

76
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,184
Yeah, you got that right.

77
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,717
Mayans torched the warehouse
where we store and assemble our weapons.

78
00:04:34,837 --> 00:04:35,653
Holy shite,

79
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,028
what does that do to your business?

80
00:04:38,148 --> 00:04:40,437
We just bought nine acres
on the edge of Amador County.

81
00:04:40,557 --> 00:04:42,911
We start rebuilding, we'll be up
and running in 2 or 3 months.

82
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:45,028
Can't you assemble them here?

83
00:04:45,148 --> 00:04:48,355
We learned our lesson the hard way:
we don't cross our money streams.

84
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:50,792
This is strictly
a legit automotive business.

85
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:54,009
So that means you'll go three months
without buying the weapons from us?

86
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:57,574
- Sam Crow's a huge piece of our income.
- Gotta make the adjustment, all right?

87
00:04:57,694 --> 00:04:59,589
I mean, it's part of business.

88
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:02,159
This isn't a business for us,
brother.

89
00:05:02,463 --> 00:05:05,313
True IRA, we're not merchants,
we're soldiers.

90
00:05:05,647 --> 00:05:08,149
The guns we sell fuel the cause.
Without it, we lose ground.

91
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:10,216
We support the cause, McKeavy.

92
00:05:10,336 --> 00:05:11,905
Shit like this just happens.

93
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:13,967
We'll have our guns
up and running in no time.

94
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:15,937
That's the problem. No time.

95
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,902
Three weeks would cripple us.

96
00:05:18,022 --> 00:05:20,684
- Three months, we can't wait for that.
- What the hell are you saying?

97
00:05:20,804 --> 00:05:23,467
I'm saying, if you can't front us
the cash to cover your downtime,

98
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:25,243
we're gonna have to find
a new buyer.

99
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:29,414
I've been buying guns from you
for over a decade, Michael.

100
00:05:29,835 --> 00:05:31,585
When you split from Adams,

101
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:33,528
I stayed with you,
'cause of our friendship.

102
00:05:33,648 --> 00:05:35,919
You stayed with me
'cause the other cowards sold out.

103
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:37,400
We're the only outlaws left.

104
00:05:37,646 --> 00:05:39,717
Now, don't take this personal, Clay.

105
00:05:39,837 --> 00:05:42,847
Your warehouse burning down
is a casualty of commerce.

106
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,807
You lose our guns,
that's a casualty of war.

107
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:50,767
Tristen!

108
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,815
What's going on?

109
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:00,541
We can't find Tristen.

110
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,274
Jesus.
She must be here somewhere.

111
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:05,118
- No, we've looked everywhere.
- She's not on any of the rides.

112
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:06,400
Oh, my God.

113
00:07:02,835 --> 00:07:06,488
{\fad(500,500)}Episode 103: Fun Town
by the Santiag Team

114
00:07:11,357 --> 00:07:13,942
McKeavy's gonna want
his usual per-month order

115
00:07:14,062 --> 00:07:17,553
{\pos(192,210)}- and a month's insurance.
- I can't get my hands on $200K.

116
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,612
{\pos(192,210)}I got every spare cent tied up
in the rebuild.

117
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,282
{\pos(192,210)}So what do I tell him?

118
00:07:24,703 --> 00:07:28,049
{\pos(192,210)}- How much time do we have?
- Well, he's going up north tomorrow,

119
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:30,175
don't know for how long,
but when he gets back,

120
00:07:30,295 --> 00:07:33,168
he'll want his cash
before he goes to Dungloe.

121
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:38,254
{\pos(192,230)}Tell the shamrock
I'll give him his money.

122
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,967
{\pos(192,230)}But I want you to go with him...

123
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:41,354
{\pos(192,230)}Courtesy escort.

124
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:43,692
{\pos(192,230)}Let me know who he's meeting with.

125
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:51,859
{\pos(192,230)}- Who's the dude in the Benz?
- Elliot Oswald.

126
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:53,304
{\pos(192,230)}As in Oswald Lumber?

127
00:07:53,424 --> 00:07:56,603
{\pos(192,230)}Yeah, Oswald Lumber,
Oswald Beef, Oswald Construction.

128
00:07:56,764 --> 00:08:00,146
{\pos(192,230)}My daughter's still in shock.
She doesn't remember much.

129
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,469
{\pos(192,230)}Asshole busted her in the jaw
and threw her down in the dirt.

130
00:08:05,044 --> 00:08:06,994
Raped her. She's 13 years old.

131
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,284
What did the cops say?

132
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:13,629
{\pos(192,220)}Took a report. Hale's out looking.

133
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:18,320
I want you to find him.

134
00:08:19,424 --> 00:08:21,229
You bring him to me first.

135
00:08:21,356 --> 00:08:22,504
Pay anything you want.

136
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:30,062
What do you think we are, Elliot?

137
00:08:30,182 --> 00:08:33,548
Oswalds have been in this town
a lot longer than Sam Crow.

138
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:35,058
I know what you are.

139
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:46,008
I don't want your money.

140
00:08:47,351 --> 00:08:49,164
Nobody comes into my town

141
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,362
and does this to an innocent girl.

142
00:08:51,482 --> 00:08:53,458
We'll find the sick bastard.

143
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:56,619
But...

144
00:08:58,547 --> 00:09:00,297
When I deliver him to you,

145
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:04,504
I'm gonna need to know
that justice will be served.

146
00:09:07,436 --> 00:09:09,295
You know what I'm saying...

147
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:11,855
old friend?

148
00:09:25,295 --> 00:09:27,802
{\pos(192,210)}We got a $200K deficit
hanging over our heads.

149
00:09:27,922 --> 00:09:30,223
{\pos(192,210)}Do we really,
really want to be out there

150
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:32,695
{\pos(192,210)}playing some pro bono Lone Ranger?

{\pos(192,210)}Guy raped a 13-year-old.

152
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:36,484
{\pos(192,210)}13.

153
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:38,424
I get it. I just don't like

154
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,626
putting my ass
on the line for some outsider.

155
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:45,137
{\pos(192,180)}Clay, Oswald doesn't give a shit
about Sam Crow.

156
00:09:45,257 --> 00:09:48,551
{\pos(192,210)}You know, people get jammed up
in this town, they don't go to the cops.

157
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,800
{\pos(192,210)}- They come to us.
- That's right, guys.

158
00:09:51,294 --> 00:09:53,344
And that means something to me.

159
00:09:54,738 --> 00:09:55,893
I don't know.

160
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,747
{\pos(192,210)}Maybe I got something to prove
with this guy{\, you know}.

161
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:00,832
{\pos(192,210)}That's my shit. So...

162
00:10:01,922 --> 00:10:03,426
Anybody wants a pass on this...

163
00:10:03,546 --> 00:10:04,830
- We're in.
- No way.

164
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,067
- I'm in.
- I'm in.

165
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:07,227
We're in.

166
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:08,451
I'm in.

167
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,587
I'm in, too.

168
00:10:09,707 --> 00:10:11,555
Guess we're hunting
the tot-banger then.

169
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:12,573
Good.

170
00:10:12,981 --> 00:10:14,033
{\So, }What do we know?

171
00:10:14,153 --> 00:10:16,368
We saw a couple guys
sporting Aryan ink.

172
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,235
Not sure if they were Darby's guys.

173
00:10:18,355 --> 00:10:20,301
Macon Woods is right
on the Lodi border.

174
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:22,614
{\pos(192,210)}Darby's got a meth shack
a couple of miles from there.

175
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:24,184
Rape as retaliation.

176
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:26,176
Certainly in the Nord wheelhouse.

177
00:10:26,296 --> 00:10:28,088
Tap into the Sanwa database.

178
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,552
{\pos(192,210)}Find out which Nords
get hard for underage pussy.

179
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,393
- {\pos(192,210)}Got it.
- Bobby and I'll go after Darby.

180
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:38,035
What's so urgent, Dad?

181
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:40,625
You know Leo Kessler,
Kessler Builders?

182
00:10:40,912 --> 00:10:42,304
- Hi.
- Hi, Leo.

183
00:10:42,487 --> 00:10:44,614
- I'm kinda in the middle of something.
- We know.

184
00:10:44,734 --> 00:10:46,314
We heard about Oswald's daughter.

185
00:10:46,475 --> 00:10:48,239
- Terrible thing.
- What is this about?

186
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:51,609
We're pretty sure
Elliot's been talking to Clay Morrow.

187
00:10:52,207 --> 00:10:56,000
Safe to assume he's probably
looking for some vigilante justice.

188
00:10:56,482 --> 00:10:58,742
- Sam Crow is looking for the rapist?
- Yes.

189
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:00,512
And, if they deliver...

190
00:11:01,352 --> 00:11:02,876
We may have a problem.

191
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,742
Oswald's very close
to selling us and our investors

192
00:11:05,862 --> 00:11:08,012
two land parcels off of County 17.

193
00:11:08,421 --> 00:11:09,871
It's over 130 acres.

194
00:11:10,095 --> 00:11:11,923
Elliot loves that kid
more than anything.

195
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:14,864
God knows what he'll do to the guy
if Clay hands him over.

196
00:11:14,984 --> 00:11:17,063
Puts Elliot in bed with Sam Crow.

197
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:19,804
And we know how Clay feels
about expansion.

198
00:11:19,924 --> 00:11:22,350
You need to make sure
you find this guy first.

199
00:11:22,664 --> 00:11:24,367
Due process of the law.

200
00:11:25,302 --> 00:11:27,352
We all want the same thing, son:

201
00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:29,938
Charming to grow and prosper.

202
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:32,403
Right.

203
00:11:32,932 --> 00:11:36,842
I think you two are leaning
a little heavier on the prosper angle.

204
00:11:38,204 --> 00:11:39,659
I gotta get back to work.

205
00:11:40,423 --> 00:11:42,231
You girls selling cookies?

206
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:46,208
We're investigating
a sexual assault.

207
00:11:46,328 --> 00:11:47,490
You serious?

208
00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:52,172
I need to talk to all your guys
that were at the carnival last night.

209
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,884
If they're not here,
get them here now.

210
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:57,365
You think a Son had something
to do with that rape?

211
00:11:57,485 --> 00:12:01,484
Half of 'em have violent crimes on
their rap sheets. Just following logic.

212
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:04,488
Wasn't it just last week
four Oakland cops

213
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:07,058
were busted
for prostitution and rape?

214
00:12:07,557 --> 00:12:10,806
Logic tells me we should ask
where your dick was last night.

215
00:12:10,926 --> 00:12:12,676
Don't say, "In your mama."

216
00:12:15,327 --> 00:12:18,673
Officers Mann and Fain
will be taking your statements.

217
00:12:19,047 --> 00:12:20,397
Could take hours.

218
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:22,100
I'm trying to run a business here.

219
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,813
We can do it here,
at the station house,

220
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,023
wherever you want to do it.

221
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,353
And don't say, "In your mama."

222
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,510
Feeling better?

223
00:12:46,825 --> 00:12:48,228
A little dopey...

224
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:49,526
So to speak.

225
00:12:49,962 --> 00:12:53,215
When you're feeling stronger,
I'll take you to see your son.

226
00:12:53,335 --> 00:12:54,471
Yeah, okay.

227
00:12:56,674 --> 00:12:58,124
Has Jax been around?

228
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,647
I don't know.

229
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:06,454
They said you had a friend
smuggle in that syringe of meth.

230
00:13:07,665 --> 00:13:09,227
I just signed the affidavit.

231
00:13:09,347 --> 00:13:11,742
The hospital's a little nervous
about the liability issues.

232
00:13:11,862 --> 00:13:13,212
I'm sure they are.

233
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,752
What?

234
00:13:21,362 --> 00:13:23,912
The two women
who loved Jackson Teller...

235
00:13:25,424 --> 00:13:28,235
Could we be at more opposite ends
of the shit spectrum?

236
00:13:28,355 --> 00:13:29,761
We're not that different.

237
00:13:29,881 --> 00:13:31,271
Save it, sweetheart.

238
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:33,189
I don't need a pep talk.
I know what I am.

239
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:34,340
So do I,

240
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:36,455
and you're not suicidal.

241
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:39,818
You didn't have anyone smuggle
in that dose.

242
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:41,790
I have a {\pretty }good idea
who {\might }may have delivered it.

243
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,437
- Don't go down that road.
- She the one who injected you?

244
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:49,843
I stared at that five-mil tube
for over an hour,

245
00:13:50,218 --> 00:13:52,869
and then I pumped it
into my favorite vein, end of story.

246
00:13:52,989 --> 00:13:53,989
Why?

247
00:13:58,613 --> 00:14:01,054
God, if you don't know why,
then you and me

248
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,586
are nothing alike.

249
00:14:13,515 --> 00:14:17,031
I'm glad I'm not sick.
You're a tough doctor to track down.

250
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
You okay?

251
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:26,083
Just... work.

252
00:14:26,905 --> 00:14:27,977
Oswald girl?

253
00:14:28,425 --> 00:14:29,675
End of the hall.

254
00:14:34,787 --> 00:14:36,348
We went to get ice cream.

255
00:14:36,468 --> 00:14:39,057
We told her to wait by the ride
if she finished before we got back.

256
00:14:39,177 --> 00:14:41,080
The guy {\working the ride }said
that she waited for a few minutes,

257
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,135
then she went to the arcade.

258
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:47,125
Any reason why she would go there?
Was she meeting someone?

259
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:49,177
Even if it seems trivial,

260
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,130
the smallest detail can help.

261
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,148
We don't know anything else.

262
00:14:54,682 --> 00:14:55,682
Sorry.

263
00:15:04,427 --> 00:15:06,850
I know this is hard
on you and Karen.

264
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,235
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

265
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,753
But anger clouds judgment,

266
00:15:19,055 --> 00:15:22,205
and it makes us do things
that we end up regretting.

267
00:15:23,201 --> 00:15:26,266
Things that we can never take back.

268
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,342
The only thing I can never take back

269
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:32,401
is what happened
to that little girl.

270
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:43,887
All right, yeah.

271
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,151
Yo, I gotta head back to TM.

272
00:15:47,694 --> 00:15:50,311
Charming PD's grilling everyone
that was at the carnival.

273
00:15:50,431 --> 00:15:51,953
Jax wants you to follow Hale,

274
00:15:52,114 --> 00:15:54,665
- keep tabs on him.
- Follow him on what?

275
00:16:13,943 --> 00:16:17,123
I can't believe these assholes
are taking another coffee break.

276
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,978
Total jerkoff. Hale must know
we're looking for the guy.

277
00:16:20,098 --> 00:16:22,017
We're gonna be here all day.

278
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:25,282
Two double tranqaccinos coming up.

279
00:16:40,118 --> 00:16:42,368
- Looking at a 12-hour nap.
- Nice.

280
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:48,885
Coming for refills.

281
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:54,502
Fresh pot, boys.

282
00:16:58,694 --> 00:16:59,716
It's hot.

283
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:04,966
Jackson?

284
00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:06,607
No, thank you.

285
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:09,425
Juice should be here soon, Clay.

286
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:11,675
Sometimes he gets lost.

287
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:18,874
That was quick.

288
00:17:19,744 --> 00:17:21,446
Good to the last drop.

289
00:17:22,444 --> 00:17:25,315
- That's so bad.
- Don't fall on the floor.

290
00:17:37,286 --> 00:17:39,669
Been talking to the Fun Town carnies
for over an hour.

291
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:40,937
Stay on him.

292
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:47,311
Think you guys could double up?
Let me take one of your bikes?

293
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:49,181
Not unless he grows tits.

294
00:17:49,844 --> 00:17:52,474
Big tits. Huge tits.

295
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,869
He's going.

296
00:18:02,368 --> 00:18:04,118
See this girl last night?

297
00:18:05,035 --> 00:18:07,029
- Who are you?
- Concerned citizens.

298
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:09,749
And what did you just say to that cop?

299
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:11,305
Why don't you ask him yourself?

300
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:14,470
- 'Cause we're asking you, Uncle Vinky.
- It's all right.

301
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,690
This girl got raped
less than a mile away.

302
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,882
Shit like that doesn't happen in
our town, which points to an outsider.

303
00:18:21,002 --> 00:18:23,271
And there's not much more outsiders
than you muppets.

304
00:18:28,214 --> 00:18:30,653
- You can go that way if you want.
- What?

305
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:34,657
All right,
tell you what I told the cop.

306
00:18:34,977 --> 00:18:38,244
All my guys were here powering
down rides, chaining up booths.

307
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:41,328
Security guards your town
hired'll tell you the same thing.

308
00:18:41,448 --> 00:18:42,416
That's right.

309
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:51,857
Wendy's out of detox.

310
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,687
Thought you'd want to know

311
00:18:54,807 --> 00:18:57,472
just in case you wanted
to bring her flowers or something.

312
00:19:12,723 --> 00:19:14,523
We got no sign of Darby.

313
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,735
Looked at the cook shacks,
his house, the Dog.

314
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:19,450
Looked all over for that guy.

315
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,023
Maybe he's gone underground.

316
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:23,563
Three of Darby's guys have done time
for sex crimes.

317
00:19:23,683 --> 00:19:25,126
Two are still in P Bay.

318
00:19:25,246 --> 00:19:27,540
Others, Johnny Yates,
got a PO Box in Pope.

319
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,629
We saw this guy
at the carnival yesterday.

320
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:31,807
You sure?

321
00:19:32,524 --> 00:19:33,557
Hang on.

322
00:19:35,072 --> 00:19:36,939
I'm in the middle of it, baby.

323
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:38,709
<i>Still looking for Darby?</i>

324
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:41,377
- Yeah. Why?
- He's at the hospital,

325
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:44,247
- heading up to the south wing.
- Thank you.

326
00:19:45,063 --> 00:19:46,613
Darby's at St. Thomas.

327
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:49,784
Finish prepping the AKs,
put 'em in the duffle,

328
00:19:49,904 --> 00:19:51,421
- full clips.
- Got it.

329
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,228
- Put these in my box.
- What are they?

330
00:19:53,348 --> 00:19:55,447
They're vitamins, vitamins.

331
00:20:11,017 --> 00:20:12,713
Give us a minute, Floyd.

332
00:20:14,222 --> 00:20:16,462
- I'll give ya two.
- All right.

333
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,606
Jesus Christ.

334
00:20:20,712 --> 00:20:22,982
My one peaceful moment of the day.

335
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:25,364
Need to know
where Hale's at with the Oswald case.

336
00:20:25,484 --> 00:20:27,854
Do you have any idea
how much heat I'm getting on this?

337
00:20:28,015 --> 00:20:30,346
I do anything
to compromise this case...

338
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:33,944
I'm not asking you to compromise.
Just tell us what you know.

339
00:20:37,274 --> 00:20:38,388
Got nothing.

340
00:20:39,022 --> 00:20:40,805
No leads, no witnesses.

341
00:20:41,432 --> 00:20:43,155
Only one that knows anything
is the girl,

342
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,371
and she's saying
she's got no memory of it.

343
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:48,961
And Karen won't let anyone near her.
Guess I don't blame her.

344
00:20:49,403 --> 00:20:51,896
Probably'd do the same
if it was my kid.

345
00:20:52,098 --> 00:20:53,046
All right.

346
00:20:54,743 --> 00:20:55,543
Jax,

347
00:20:56,793 --> 00:20:58,998
you guys cannot screw me on this.

348
00:20:59,811 --> 00:21:03,299
I don't catch this rapist,
I'm the one under the microscope.

349
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,852
That's just bad for all of us.

350
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:08,458
Don't worry, Chief.
We'll catch him.

351
00:21:13,826 --> 00:21:14,843
Shit.

352
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,558
Shit.

353
00:21:23,338 --> 00:21:24,887
How you doing, Ernie?

354
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:32,222
It's going good.
How's the beautiful queen of bikers?

355
00:21:34,218 --> 00:21:37,196
Holding it together.
What brings you here?

356
00:21:37,527 --> 00:21:39,874
Four packs a day finally
caught up to Mom.

357
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:41,463
Stage 4 lung cancer.

358
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:45,791
Sorry to hear that.

359
00:21:49,221 --> 00:21:51,055
You look real good, Gemma.

360
00:21:51,882 --> 00:21:55,251
- Clay must be keeping you happy.
- Does the best he can.

361
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,199
Interesting new accessory.

362
00:22:00,565 --> 00:22:02,429
Picked it up at my little
retreat in Chino.

363
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:04,459
It's simple, but it says it.

364
00:22:04,997 --> 00:22:07,693
Jewish doctors keeping
your mother alive must love it.

365
00:22:07,813 --> 00:22:10,449
That's right, you got
a little Jew in you, don't you?

366
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:11,500
A bit.

367
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,916
On the angry Russian side.

368
00:22:15,996 --> 00:22:17,631
Nice talking to you, Ernie.

369
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:20,773
Gotta catch my train
back to Auschwitz.

370
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:32,438
- Your old lady's still a handful.
- That she is.

371
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:34,022
{\My guys tell me}You've been looking for me.

372
00:22:34,182 --> 00:22:36,421
Think we had something to do
with the raped kid{\that kid getting raped last night}?

373
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:37,764
Thought crossed my mind.

374
00:22:37,884 --> 00:22:40,949
Tearing up the daughter
of an important citizen like that.

375
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:44,061
You know, maybe that's your way
of pissing on Charming ground.

376
00:22:44,181 --> 00:22:48,136
When I decide to piss on Charming,
it ain't gonna be on a little girl.

377
00:22:48,256 --> 00:22:50,642
We know about your hookup
with the Mayans.

378
00:22:50,762 --> 00:22:53,521
I'm guessing you and Alvarez
got kinda cozy in Chino.

379
00:22:53,641 --> 00:22:56,549
I'm just trying to learn how
to get along with my brothers of color.

380
00:22:56,669 --> 00:22:58,571
Opening my mind
to bigger possibilities.

381
00:22:58,691 --> 00:23:01,581
Well, don't think too big.
Small mind suits you.

382
00:23:01,701 --> 00:23:03,445
Last night, what, what?

383
00:23:06,617 --> 00:23:08,380
All my guys were with me.

384
00:23:08,907 --> 00:23:10,285
We ate at Meyers,

385
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:12,637
then we shot pool at the Dog.
Ask around.

386
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:14,896
- What about Johnny Yates?
- Yates?

387
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:18,386
He ain't with us. That boy never fit in.
He pissed off Whistler one night,

388
00:23:18,506 --> 00:23:21,028
{\shattered}wracked Johnny's nose.
Didn't see him again.

389
00:23:22,189 --> 00:23:23,916
You do remember Whistler?

390
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:27,681
Yeah. I remember him.
Don't see him around much anymore.

391
00:23:27,801 --> 00:23:29,703
Yeah, he just fell off
the face of the Earth.

392
00:23:29,863 --> 00:23:32,113
It's funny how easy that can happen.

393
00:23:32,982 --> 00:23:35,627
Why don't you and me straighten out
our business another time?

394
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,888
Right now,

395
00:23:37,314 --> 00:23:39,047
I need an address on Yates.

396
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,979
No, I ain't gonna rat him out to you{\, Clay}.
Ain't gonna happen.

397
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:44,957
He's got a half a dozen sex
crimes on his rap sheet.

398
00:23:45,077 --> 00:23:46,826
Now, if he raped that girl,

399
00:23:46,946 --> 00:23:50,842
the quicker I find him,
the quicker the eyes are off both of us.

400
00:23:52,994 --> 00:23:54,019
Hey, yo.

401
00:23:58,515 --> 00:24:01,177
His mother raised
fighting dogs up in Pope.

402
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:03,215
He used to stay with her.

403
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:06,128
I think she remarried.
Last name is Chester.

404
00:24:06,797 --> 00:24:07,843
Thanks.

405
00:24:07,963 --> 00:24:11,885
Whatever shit you stir up,
make sure the Nords stay clear of it.

406
00:24:20,738 --> 00:24:23,937
Call Trammel, see if he can scare up
an address on Mother Yates.

407
00:24:24,057 --> 00:24:25,514
I want bodies on this.

408
00:24:25,634 --> 00:24:28,251
You think Darby
could be setting us up?

409
00:24:28,746 --> 00:24:31,438
I don't know.
But if he does tip off Yates,

410
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:33,767
we could be walking into
an angry whiteout.

411
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,827
- Do I even ask?
- No. No, you don't.

412
00:24:42,793 --> 00:24:43,825
Juice.

413
00:24:44,891 --> 00:24:45,885
Juice?

414
00:24:46,815 --> 00:24:47,899
{\Juice?!}

415
00:24:48,274 --> 00:24:49,402
Get the AKs.

416
00:24:51,274 --> 00:24:52,662
Come on. Let's go.

417
00:25:18,097 --> 00:25:21,064
- Looks like a full house.
- The guys on the porch are armed.

418
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:24,943
- Not sure about the ones in the back.
- Take down the ones at the cages.

419
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:27,395
- We'll get the lookouts.
Let's go.

420
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,575
- No clips.
- What?!

421
00:25:43,238 --> 00:25:44,171
Goddamn, empty.

422
00:26:20,028 --> 00:26:23,227
- There's no clip.
- Goddamn Juice.

423
00:26:23,347 --> 00:26:24,982
Back door.
Counting 20.

424
00:26:46,935 --> 00:26:49,361
I haven't acted out sexually
in over three years.

425
00:26:49,757 --> 00:26:52,966
And all these men will vouch for me.
I'm a saved man.

426
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:55,736
I guess we got some bad information.
Sorry.

427
00:26:56,312 --> 00:26:58,036
A little misunderstanding.

428
00:26:58,196 --> 00:27:02,179
Forget about our little mistake...
we'll forget about Mom's illegal mutts.

429
00:27:02,893 --> 00:27:04,542
It's not too late for you men.

430
00:27:05,137 --> 00:27:07,366
Jesus Christ our Lord
and Savior can save you.

431
00:27:07,486 --> 00:27:09,593
He can deliver you
from all your transgressions.

432
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:13,089
I appreciate your zeal, padre,
but my transgressions...

433
00:27:14,347 --> 00:27:16,661
- all I got left.
- Amen.

434
00:27:19,676 --> 00:27:23,019
My Lord, The Kumbaya.

435
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:27,732
Kumbaya. My lord The Kumbaya.

436
00:27:27,892 --> 00:27:31,665
They think they're protecting her
by building a wall around her.

437
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,948
Tristen needs to talk to somebody.

438
00:27:35,686 --> 00:27:38,458
And I need something,
anything to help catch this guy,

439
00:27:38,578 --> 00:27:40,537
so we're not doing this
again with another girl.

440
00:27:42,276 --> 00:27:44,924
I know Karen needs to send
some insurance forms.

441
00:27:45,044 --> 00:27:47,585
I'll try to get an admin
to keep her busy for a while.

442
00:27:48,219 --> 00:27:49,230
Thank you.

443
00:27:50,081 --> 00:27:51,632
I need a favor, too.

444
00:27:52,982 --> 00:27:55,042
It's more of a question really.

445
00:27:55,655 --> 00:27:58,433
- It's going to sound very dramatic.
- Okay.

446
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:03,079
If I had a restraing order
against someone in another city,

447
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:05,374
would it still be valid
if I went someplace else?

448
00:28:05,494 --> 00:28:08,544
That all depends.
Every state's a little different.

449
00:28:09,068 --> 00:28:10,867
You think that someone
might be coming here?

450
00:28:10,987 --> 00:28:12,695
No, no, I doubt it.

451
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:16,414
There was this guy I dated

452
00:28:16,941 --> 00:28:20,843
during my internship in Chicago.
Things got weird. He got a little...

453
00:28:23,063 --> 00:28:24,372
It's hard to explain.

454
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:28,446
{\Well}Want to give me his name?
I'll run it through the system.

455
00:28:28,566 --> 00:28:31,081
{\No, }That's okay.
I'm just being paranoid.

456
00:28:32,842 --> 00:28:34,954
How long ago did you get the RO?

457
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,362
About six or seven months ago.

458
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,554
I'll make some general calls, okay?

459
00:28:39,714 --> 00:28:42,589
- See if it's still in play out here.
- Thanks.

460
00:29:02,394 --> 00:29:03,995
What the hell are you doing here?

461
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,745
Something to brighten up your room.

462
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:13,596
I understand you and the old girlfriend
have become buddies.

463
00:29:15,374 --> 00:29:17,993
It's a little late
for the panic button.

464
00:29:18,516 --> 00:29:20,643
I didn't say anything to anyone.

465
00:29:21,865 --> 00:29:23,053
That's smart.

466
00:29:23,644 --> 00:29:25,742
No one would believe you anyhow.

467
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:27,956
That whole junkie thing.

468
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:32,868
All I did was give you
an option, sweetheart.

469
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,443
You're the one who took
the coward's way out.

470
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:40,223
- You couldn't even do that right.
- We all can't be rocks like you,

471
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:41,558
Mother Gemma.

472
00:29:44,123 --> 00:29:45,911
I don't know how you do it.

473
00:29:46,602 --> 00:29:47,697
What's that?

474
00:29:48,305 --> 00:29:49,833
Keep all the lies straight.

475
00:29:50,348 --> 00:29:52,634
All the dirty little secrets buried.

476
00:29:53,817 --> 00:29:56,573
Your conscience
must be locked up real tight.

477
00:30:00,204 --> 00:30:03,948
Nothing gets in the way of me
taking care of my family.

478
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,874
Especially my conscience.

479
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:11,854
But then you obviously
can't grasp that.

480
00:30:13,556 --> 00:30:15,430
Being a baby killer and all.

481
00:30:17,463 --> 00:30:18,653
Need something, sweetie?

482
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:21,761
Just some water for these flowers.

483
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:24,426
Don't want 'em dying on us.

484
00:30:28,323 --> 00:30:30,983
- She holds the key.
- I did not give you permission

485
00:30:31,103 --> 00:30:32,917
to question my daughter.

486
00:30:34,641 --> 00:30:36,603
I wasn't questioning her, ma'am.

487
00:30:36,723 --> 00:30:39,173
I was just seeing
how she was feeling.

488
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:40,440
Bullshit.

489
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,754
I'm not going to let you people
traumatize her again.

490
00:30:44,062 --> 00:30:46,625
You leave her the hell alone.

491
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:54,052
What an idiot.

492
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:57,319
Probably thought it was speed.

493
00:30:58,742 --> 00:31:00,908
I want something very special.

494
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,728
Yeah.

495
00:31:08,814 --> 00:31:11,539
"Ride like the wind.
The wheels go round."

496
00:31:14,088 --> 00:31:15,084
I'll be back.

497
00:31:19,164 --> 00:31:20,266
{\- Hey.
- Hey.}

498
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,198
- Thought you guys were on the hunt.
- Hit a dead end.

499
00:31:28,349 --> 00:31:31,176
- The junkie's awake.
- Don't call her that.

500
00:31:32,409 --> 00:31:34,153
All right. Sorry.

501
00:31:39,242 --> 00:31:41,423
You think he can really hear you?

502
00:31:44,355 --> 00:31:45,362
Yes.

503
00:31:46,911 --> 00:31:47,659
I do.

504
00:31:58,838 --> 00:32:01,423
- Did you find the guy?
- No, not yet.

505
00:32:02,593 --> 00:32:04,173
We need you to talk
to Tristen{\your daughter again}.

506
00:32:04,293 --> 00:32:06,669
She{\Tristen} doesn't remember anything
after she got off the ride.

507
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:08,875
Got to dig a little deeper.

508
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:11,406
We need something.
The guy in the car, was he black,

509
00:32:11,526 --> 00:32:14,076
- was he white...
- She's still in shock.

510
00:32:14,426 --> 00:32:16,376
Karen just wants her to rest.

511
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:21,603
Look, man, Tristen's our only shot
at finding this asshole.

512
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,529
Do you want our help?

513
00:32:26,451 --> 00:32:27,955
I'll talk to Karen.

514
00:32:29,232 --> 00:32:30,421
You find him.

515
00:32:47,384 --> 00:32:48,527
Hi, sweetie.

516
00:32:51,234 --> 00:32:52,966
You feeling any better?

517
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:58,216
Guess there's a lot of people
asking you questions.

518
00:33:00,077 --> 00:33:02,322
My mom told me to text her
if anyone

519
00:33:02,535 --> 00:33:04,708
- tried to...
- It's okay, honey.

520
00:33:05,515 --> 00:33:07,530
Your mom and I are old friends.

521
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,620
She told me everything.

522
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,414
I am so sorry that happened to you.

523
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:19,252
She told you?

524
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:24,651
Don't worry, baby.

525
00:33:26,021 --> 00:33:27,600
It's going to be okay.

526
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:38,269
Had a little
conversation with Tristen.

527
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:40,742
What?!

528
00:33:40,862 --> 00:33:42,607
Why would you be
talking to my daughter?

529
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,952
I told her I knew about the secret.

530
00:33:46,938 --> 00:33:48,196
She seemed relieved.

531
00:33:49,006 --> 00:33:50,948
What the hell did you say to her?

532
00:33:51,877 --> 00:33:54,370
She remembers
everything, doesn't she?

533
00:33:57,045 --> 00:33:59,012
You don't want the trial...

534
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:00,957
messy press.

535
00:34:02,152 --> 00:34:03,886
You just want to sweep it
under the rug.

536
00:34:04,006 --> 00:34:05,522
Don't you judge me.

537
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:08,091
I'm not judging you.

538
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:10,504
You don't know me.

539
00:34:11,568 --> 00:34:14,266
And I got no idea
what it's like to be you.

540
00:34:16,275 --> 00:34:19,087
But I know something
about burying the truth.

541
00:34:19,965 --> 00:34:22,689
And it's a burden
that you never want to put on a kid.

542
00:34:23,596 --> 00:34:26,275
Tristen has to know
that this really happened.

543
00:34:26,435 --> 00:34:27,935
Make her hide it...

544
00:34:29,153 --> 00:34:30,431
lie about it...

545
00:34:31,516 --> 00:34:35,125
it'll come back and shit
on every relationship she ever has.

546
00:34:35,695 --> 00:34:38,371
That rich, happy life you've worked
so hard to give her,

547
00:34:38,531 --> 00:34:40,317
you just kiss it good-bye.

548
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,354
If they arrest this guy,

549
00:34:45,046 --> 00:34:47,287
everyone puts a face to the crime.

550
00:34:49,394 --> 00:34:51,097
And then it becomes real.

551
00:34:51,907 --> 00:34:53,592
And for the rest of her life

552
00:34:53,712 --> 00:34:56,610
in Charming,
she's not going to be Tristen.

553
00:34:58,568 --> 00:35:01,861
She's going to be the girl
that was raped at Fun Town.

554
00:35:02,549 --> 00:35:05,222
Sweetheart,
in her head,

555
00:35:07,016 --> 00:35:10,512
she'll always be the girl
who was raped at Fun Town.

556
00:35:13,635 --> 00:35:16,095
Only thing worse
than everyone knowing

557
00:35:16,938 --> 00:35:18,306
is no one knowing.

558
00:35:31,183 --> 00:35:32,907
Karen Oswald came clean.

559
00:35:33,027 --> 00:35:36,835
One of the carney guys raped Tristen.
Fat guy dressed like a clown.

560
00:35:36,955 --> 00:35:39,223
Jesus.
Does Hale know?

561
00:35:39,383 --> 00:35:41,981
Not yet.
I can't stop her from telling him.

562
00:35:42,192 --> 00:35:43,145
Shit.

563
00:35:43,743 --> 00:35:44,862
Thanks, Mom.

564
00:36:05,286 --> 00:36:06,359
Goddamn it!

565
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,940
Hear you guys
are harboring a fugitive.

566
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:36,620
- What are you going to do about it?
- Citizen's arrest.

567
00:37:17,188 --> 00:37:18,767
Got him!
Let's go!

568
00:37:21,904 --> 00:37:22,942
Come on.

569
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,099
What happened here?

570
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,161
Nothing.

571
00:37:52,983 --> 00:37:53,941
Find him!

572
00:38:01,678 --> 00:38:02,712
Shut up.

573
00:38:04,628 --> 00:38:07,312
Here's the scumbag
raped your little girl.

574
00:38:13,597 --> 00:38:16,005
Cattle guys
call this an Elsie-maker.

575
00:38:16,283 --> 00:38:18,465
It's used to cut
the balls off of bulls.

576
00:38:19,366 --> 00:38:20,342
Strip him.

577
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:33,128
Jesus!

578
00:38:38,157 --> 00:38:40,412
He deserves
every second of the pain.

579
00:38:54,078 --> 00:38:56,253
What are you
going to do here, Elliot?

580
00:38:57,832 --> 00:38:59,090
We had a deal.

581
00:39:18,214 --> 00:39:19,014
Sorry.

582
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,491
I'm sorry. I...

583
00:39:48,075 --> 00:39:50,254
- Hold him still.
- Clay!

584
00:40:06,049 --> 00:40:08,367
- Let him bleed out.
- Shit. Holy shit!

585
00:40:08,731 --> 00:40:10,619
Bury him in the woods.
Mark the grave.

586
00:40:14,129 --> 00:40:16,185
Pick those up and gift wrap 'em.

587
00:40:18,643 --> 00:40:21,329
Put this in a bag.
Make sure you don't touch it.

588
00:40:21,449 --> 00:40:25,051
- It's got Oswald's prints all over it.
- What the hell are we doing here?

589
00:40:27,081 --> 00:40:29,544
Taking out some real
estate insurance.

590
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:33,257
Making sure Oswald doesn't sell off
those tracts of lumber acreage.

591
00:40:33,377 --> 00:40:35,029
You knew this was coming

592
00:40:35,635 --> 00:40:39,022
whether Oswald had the nerve or not.
This whole hunt was about blackmail.

593
00:40:39,142 --> 00:40:41,432
Well, actually,
the leverage was just

594
00:40:41,655 --> 00:40:45,445
a fortunate byproduct
of my community spirit.

595
00:40:49,497 --> 00:40:51,619
Hey, you want me to be your #2,

596
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:54,217
protect this club, then I gotta know
where you're taking us.

597
00:40:54,337 --> 00:40:56,165
Otherwise, there's no trust.

598
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,576
And if you and me
don't trust each other,

599
00:41:00,026 --> 00:41:01,800
Sam Crow's got a problem.

600
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:06,970
If Oswald's land goes commercial,

601
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,177
that means housing developments.

602
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,766
Population rises, brings more cops,

603
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:16,442
more state and federal involvement.

604
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,764
Charming goes Disney.

605
00:41:19,549 --> 00:41:20,691
And Sam Crow

606
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:24,521
gets squeezed out
by the most dangerous gang of all:

607
00:41:26,093 --> 00:41:27,679
old white money.

608
00:41:31,106 --> 00:41:32,209
Now you know.

609
00:41:42,676 --> 00:41:45,614
<i>"When we take action
to avenge the ones we love,</i>

610
00:41:45,734 --> 00:41:49,350
<i>"personal justice collides
with social and divine justice.</i>

611
00:41:49,695 --> 00:41:52,326
<i>"We become judge, jury and God.</i>

612
00:41:52,873 --> 00:41:55,700
<i>"With that choice
comes daunting responsibility.</i>

613
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,464
<i>"Some men cave under that weight.
Others abuse the momentum.</i>

614
00:42:00,009 --> 00:42:03,698
<i>"The true outlaw finds the balance
between the passion in his heart</i>

615
00:42:04,175 --> 00:42:05,484
<i>"and the reason in his mind.</i>

616
00:42:06,314 --> 00:42:09,780
<i>"His solution is always
an equal mix of might and right."</i>

617
00:42:13,645 --> 00:42:16,150
Here's all that stuff
you requested, Agent Kohn.

618
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:18,848
Only thing that flagged in Charming
was an outlaw MC charter...

619
00:42:18,968 --> 00:42:22,036
Sons of Anarchy.
No charges in over five years,

620
00:42:22,156 --> 00:42:24,295
but past offenses have been
smuggling and gunrunning.

621
00:42:26,772 --> 00:42:28,174
- Thanks.
- Okay.

622
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:12,760
I don't want you
hurting yourself, Wendy.

623
00:43:14,588 --> 00:43:15,794
Not over this.

624
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:20,311
What happened to Abel
is not your fault.

625
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,067
Yeah.
I'm powerless.

626
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,319
That bullshit excuse
is even getting old to me.

627
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:26,797
It's not that.

628
00:43:30,453 --> 00:43:32,279
Us getting back together.

629
00:43:34,287 --> 00:43:36,197
I knew that would turn bad.

630
00:43:37,845 --> 00:43:39,453
I don't want to be married.

631
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:42,289
No way I was ready for a kid.

632
00:43:43,264 --> 00:43:45,565
When you got pregnant,
I hated you.

633
00:43:47,278 --> 00:43:49,384
Hated that you gave him a name.

634
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:54,539
So I bailed.

635
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,970
Him born tweaking,
his belly hanging out...

636
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:00,048
that's on me, babe.

637
00:44:10,884 --> 00:44:11,974
Look at him.

638
00:44:12,418 --> 00:44:13,665
He's so small.

639
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:17,524
He's so small, Jax.
What did I do?

640
00:44:24,491 --> 00:44:27,236
I'm sorry, little boy.
I'm so sorry.

641
00:44:39,613 --> 00:44:40,650
Now what?

642
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,752
He stays in the toaster
till he can throw a punch.

643
00:44:47,944 --> 00:44:49,982
We ship your ass off to rehab.

644
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:52,399
Again.

645
00:45:00,569 --> 00:45:01,577
Thank you, Jax.

646
00:45:02,262 --> 00:45:03,285
Thank you.

647
00:45:10,157 --> 00:45:11,131
Hey,

648
00:45:11,567 --> 00:45:12,522
idiot.

649
00:45:12,642 --> 00:45:13,642
Wake up.

650
00:45:17,645 --> 00:45:20,179
You must have really
pissed off your buddies.

651
00:45:24,045 --> 00:45:25,045
Shit.

652
00:45:26,803 --> 00:45:30,397
Come on. Get out of here before I slap
an indecent exposure on you.

653
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:35,397
Sorry, Chief.
I'm not sure what...

654
00:45:36,646 --> 00:45:37,774
I gotta go.

655
00:45:37,894 --> 00:45:39,548
SLIGHTLY RETARDED CHILD

656
00:45:39,668 --> 00:45:41,707
I'm late for my 8:00 feeding.

657
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,723
Officer!

658
00:46:20,234 --> 00:46:21,241
Yes?

659
00:46:24,399 --> 00:46:27,121
Agent Kohn, ATF.
Chicago Three Division.

660
00:46:27,447 --> 00:46:30,102
Deputy Chief, Hale.
What brings you here?

661
00:46:30,222 --> 00:46:32,848
I'm working in interstate
weapons case.

662
00:46:32,968 --> 00:46:36,461
Outlaw crew in your town maybe involved,
Sons of Anarchy.

663
00:46:41,939 --> 00:46:43,560
Welcome in Charming.
