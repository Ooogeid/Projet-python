00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,935
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:05,171
I've had your privileges suspended.
The ruse you played with Telford,

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,590
faking symptoms
to extend his critical status?

4
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:10,468
It was unethical and a breach of
insurance law.

5
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:13,220
Hello? Hey, buddy.

6
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:16,074
- Where's you dad, shithead?
- I ain't telling you shit,

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,099
race traitor!

8
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,311
Call child services.
Have this little psychopath committed.

9
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:23,731
Ethan Zobelle is
stealing your gun source.

10
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,651
- What do you want?
- I know that you two have history.

11
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:29,028
He stole your wife,
raised your daughter.

12
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,879
You will be registered
as a confidential informant.

13
00:00:32,004 --> 00:00:34,784
I've given you Edmond, and now
you're dicking me around?

14
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,590
Stahl threatened to tell Jimmy.

15
00:00:36,715 --> 00:00:39,184
Jimmy will kill both Fiona
and Kerrianne to hurt me.

16
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:41,666
We're not gonna let anything
happen to your family.

17
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:44,418
The night of Bobby's party,
I was attacked.

18
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,588
- Girl jumps out in a panic.
- He's choking! Please help me!

19
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,719
There were three of 'em.
They raped me.

20
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:56,263
- When he spoke, I knew his voice.
- Sorry, ma'am.

21
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,307
Zobelle's right hand, Weston.

22
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:01,977
How do you want to handle it?

23
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,762
We kill 'em all.

24
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,590
Come on, little man.

25
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,706
Don't worry, baby.

26
00:01:43,254 --> 00:01:44,663
Strap in, sweetie.

27
00:02:35,326 --> 00:02:37,376
- Everyone's in.
- Okay, good.

28
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:39,074
Lock it down.

29
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:45,039
Hey, lock it down!

30
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:21,133
Everybody!
Listen up!

31
00:03:28,702 --> 00:03:31,335
I want to welcome
you-all to the club reaper.

32
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,217
Glad you made
your reservations early,

33
00:03:33,342 --> 00:03:36,242
'cos as you can see,
we are booked to capacity.

34
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:39,151
You're here because you're family.

35
00:03:39,276 --> 00:03:41,876
And because samcro takes care
of its own.

36
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:44,654
Next couple of days,

37
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:49,243
this club's got some business
to handle that could put our members

38
00:03:49,425 --> 00:03:51,841
and the people connected to us in...

39
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:54,808
Unfriendly situations.

40
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,947
Now, chances are,
nothing's going to happen, but...

41
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:03,617
People have already been hurt
on my watch.

42
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:10,207
And that ain't ever
gonna happen again.

43
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:17,051
Nobody gets in.
Nobody leaves without an escort.

44
00:04:17,176 --> 00:04:19,258
You got a safety concern,
you talk to Piney.

45
00:04:20,624 --> 00:04:23,649
You got a comfort concern,
you talk to my queen.

46
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:27,182
Under this roof, you'll all be safe.

47
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:31,421
Want you to make yourself at home.

48
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:34,034
I love all of you.

49
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,341
All right!

50
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:47,828
<i>Riding through this world</i>

51
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,623

<i>God takes your soul</i>

60
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:19,884
Episode 212: The Culling

61
00:05:23,513 --> 00:05:24,513
All right.

62
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:26,936
Got all the ammo.
We just need the AKs.

63
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:28,744
We got two cases at the safe house.

64
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:31,638
The problem is,
ATF will be sitting on it,

65
00:05:31,763 --> 00:05:34,249
- waiting for Cameron to show.
- And when he does,

66
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,540
Stahl's going to get to Jimmy O
and tag me the rat.

67
00:05:37,953 --> 00:05:39,571
We're gonna protect your family.

68
00:05:39,696 --> 00:05:41,546
Already put a call in
to McGee in Belfast.

69
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:44,871
- Club's gonna watch over Kerrianne.
- You should reach out to Fiona.

70
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:47,589
- Bring her in. We'll keep her safe.
- I know.

71
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,224
- Appreciate it, boys.
- It's all just a precaution, bro.

72
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,781
We got a way to get our guns

73
00:05:51,906 --> 00:05:53,936
and convince Jimmy
who the real rat is.

74
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,388
- Right.
- Lifted these from ATF

75
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,956
before they left.

76
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,597
We show Jimmy

77
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:07,276
that Cameron and Edmond have been
under the ATF's thumb,

78
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:10,452
should be enough to convince the IRA
the betrayal's in-house.

79
00:06:10,895 --> 00:06:11,704
Good.

80
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,039
And how do we get our
guns from the safe house?

81
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,666
The old bait-and-switch.

82
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:18,370
We'll move on the Irish.

83
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:21,789
You, Ope, and Juice start spreading
the racial harmony gossip, all right?

84
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:22,923
You got it.

85
00:06:29,381 --> 00:06:30,389
What happened?

86
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:33,489
My body rejected the implant.

87
00:06:35,857 --> 00:06:36,857
I know.

88
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:38,313
Stupid idea.

89
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,946
- Where is he at?
- His year's up in in about a month.

90
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:51,755
How is everybody
feeling about him patching in?

91
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,154
Half a sack...

92
00:06:54,808 --> 00:06:56,215
Shitload of balls.

93
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,335
You let me know what Tacoma can do.

94
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,423
It's good you're here, man.
We're going to need the muscle.

95
00:07:04,954 --> 00:07:06,804
You okay with this, Tiggy?

96
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:11,161
Yeah, it's really great.

97
00:07:13,814 --> 00:07:15,164
You want to kiss?

98
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,816
I'm not okay with this.

99
00:07:23,755 --> 00:07:25,055
I couldn't tell.

100
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:34,663
Get out of my sight,
or I'm gonna do you serious harm

101
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,830
for the upset you caused my kids.

102
00:07:37,187 --> 00:07:39,095
Little junior's a psychopath.

103
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,621
Not here to provoke.
Here to educate.

104
00:07:47,095 --> 00:07:48,633
Seems your great white hope

105
00:07:48,758 --> 00:07:51,883
only gives a shit
about one color: green.

106
00:07:52,818 --> 00:07:55,468
Zobelle is dealing heroin
with the Mayans.

107
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:58,726
Those AKs that you took from us...

108
00:07:59,218 --> 00:08:01,647
gave them to brown
to control the street.

109
00:08:03,227 --> 00:08:04,755
You're talking out of your ass.

110
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,820
I followed Zobelle
and one of your guys.

111
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,632
They met with Alvarez
and left with a duffel of heroin.

112
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:11,974
Guess they've been
keeping you out of the loop.

113
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:13,909
Lots of private meetings, AJ?

114
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,427
You being the true believer and all.

115
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:19,956
You need to leave.

116
00:08:30,371 --> 00:08:32,221
Say hi to your kids for me.

117
00:09:01,112 --> 00:09:03,732
- We don't have much time.
- For what? What's going on?

118
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:07,462
The feds may be closing in on Jimmy.
There's a chance it could blow back.

119
00:09:08,055 --> 00:09:09,755
Did you rat him, Filip?

120
00:09:11,014 --> 00:09:13,051
But the ATF are threatening to
tell that lie.

121
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:14,869
Jesus.

122
00:09:15,696 --> 00:09:16,947
If he thinks...

123
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:22,227
Clay's already tasked Belfast.
They're going to watch over Kerrianne.

124
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:24,188
What have you done?

125
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:27,225
You have to come with me.

126
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,233
We're in lockdown,
and we can keep you safe

127
00:09:30,358 --> 00:09:32,779
- if this thing goes bad.
- Come with you?

128
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:35,743
Who do you think I am?
One of your old ladies?

129
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,318
Jimmy'd kill me if he knew
I was here.

130
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:45,083
I love my daughter.

131
00:09:48,552 --> 00:09:50,002
And I love you, Fi.

132
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,408
I just want
to take care of my family.

133
00:09:57,183 --> 00:09:58,774
My sweet boy.

134
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:02,197
You never change.

135
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:37,086
We got a problem, Jimmy.

136
00:10:39,696 --> 00:10:41,714
ATF's got a probe up your ass.

137
00:10:48,134 --> 00:10:49,134
Jesus.

138
00:10:50,664 --> 00:10:51,823
Where'd you get these?

139
00:10:51,948 --> 00:10:54,027
Got charming PD on the payroll.

140
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,399
ATF tried to use those
to piss us off,

141
00:10:56,524 --> 00:10:58,073
hoping we'd turn on you.

142
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
We didn't.

143
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,239
Guess who did.

144
00:11:02,882 --> 00:11:03,882
The boy.

145
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:09,007
Our guy in PD saw Stahl meet with him
at the safe house.

146
00:11:09,348 --> 00:11:10,613
Registered CI.

147
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:13,495
And the feds are still
watching the house.

148
00:11:14,432 --> 00:11:15,982
We can't get our AKs.

149
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:20,178
You coming with a solution?

150
00:11:40,584 --> 00:11:43,167
Jesus, what are you doing here, Pol?

151
00:11:44,478 --> 00:11:45,528
I told you.

152
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,241
Things are crazy for us.

153
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,851
So that's why you had to cut off
my father's gun supply?

154
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:55,792
You're here on business?

155
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:12,554
Oh, shit.
I've missed you.

156
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,700
Thanks.

157
00:12:37,396 --> 00:12:39,958
- You want some coffee, doll?
- I can get it.

158
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,593
I got it.
Cream and sugar?

159
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:44,054
Sure.

160
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:45,965
Black, two sugars.

161
00:12:49,258 --> 00:12:50,808
They need to do that.

162
00:12:51,266 --> 00:12:52,435
Show respect.

163
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:53,947
Oh, please.

164
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,781
Don't just toss that off.

165
00:12:57,036 --> 00:12:59,086
You've earned that, sweetheart.

166
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:02,377
You're not just some crow-eater.

167
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,317
You're Jax Teller's old lady.

168
00:13:06,794 --> 00:13:08,544
And that means something.

169
00:13:08,945 --> 00:13:10,373
In this clubhouse,

170
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:12,383
and in this town.

171
00:13:14,106 --> 00:13:16,206
People need to show you respect.

172
00:13:17,901 --> 00:13:20,853
And you don't take shit from anyone.

173
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,951
Past few months have been brutal.

174
00:13:41,076 --> 00:13:43,725
For all of us, Niners, Asians.

175
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,674
Losing more than half your
h- territory to brown.

176
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,994
Sons struggling to reboot weapons.

177
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:51,383
Porn business burned to the ground.

178
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:53,165
The Gaza connect is back on-line;

179
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,010
our gun supply's being restocked.

180
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:58,195
So what? You can defend
the little piece you got left?

181
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,070
What about what you lost?

182
00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:02,048
You're gonna need help.

183
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,758
Not looking for partners.

184
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,720
- Neither are we.
- We ain't talking about a partnership.

185
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,938
Talking about an understanding.

186
00:14:09,788 --> 00:14:12,044
We all have a common enemy.

187
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,228
Alvarez is running proxy
for a bigger player,

188
00:14:15,644 --> 00:14:16,994
backed by the AB.

189
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:20,108
Ethan Zobelle...

190
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,300
League of American Nationalists.

191
00:14:27,369 --> 00:14:28,369
Shit.

192
00:14:28,794 --> 00:14:30,285
Those crazy peckerwoods?

193
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,334
They all talking about god's plan

194
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,509
for a free world without color.

195
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,230
Without samcro.

196
00:14:36,355 --> 00:14:38,168
He's pushing us out of our own town.

197
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:41,019
Financed by your hard-earned
drug money.

198
00:14:41,598 --> 00:14:43,632
Zobelle's the one arming the mayans,

199
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,750
helping 'em take over heroin.

200
00:14:46,027 --> 00:14:50,031
We stop Zobelle, Mayans lose
their guns and they lose their power.

201
00:14:50,841 --> 00:14:53,395
Then we help you take back
what's yours.

202
00:14:54,571 --> 00:14:55,936
For a little extra.

203
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,692
All the mayan territory.

204
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,359
Wipe 'em out.
Split it up.

205
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,986
Henry,
you get everything South of Ghosttown.

206
00:15:05,553 --> 00:15:07,986
Niners, you take everything north.

207
00:15:13,868 --> 00:15:16,644
Friendly borders means
we could focus on business,

208
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:18,291
instead of staying alive.

209
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:20,131
Agreed.

210
00:15:22,457 --> 00:15:23,457
All right.

211
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:37,827
Son of a bitch.

212
00:16:14,131 --> 00:16:14,931
Don't.

213
00:16:17,065 --> 00:16:18,712
Look, this is sanctioned.

214
00:16:18,837 --> 00:16:20,645
Zobelle knows all about this.
I swear.

215
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,896
Where are the guns?

216
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,899
The mexicans.

217
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,693
Don't be...

218
00:16:36,472 --> 00:16:39,164
you need to put ointment
on these burns every few hours.

219
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:42,539
Otherwise you run
a pretty high risk of infection.

220
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:44,807
Man,

221
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:47,578
you must've really
pissed somebody off.

222
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:51,259
My personality is such
that there's no middle ground.

223
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,566
People either love me or loathe me.

224
00:16:53,691 --> 00:16:55,722
Jesus Christ, you just won't die.

225
00:16:56,329 --> 00:17:00,333
He showed up at the gate. He has some
eyewitness intel on the Caracara.

226
00:17:01,886 --> 00:17:03,123
C'mon, doc.

227
00:17:03,997 --> 00:17:05,882
Let's go run those errands.

228
00:17:07,018 --> 00:17:08,432
You take somebody.

229
00:17:11,728 --> 00:17:14,783
- Don't worry. I'll put someone on her.
- Thanks, old man.

230
00:17:18,675 --> 00:17:19,746
What'd you see?

231
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,164
Three or four of 'em.

232
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,459
Looked like they all had aryan ink.
They called one of 'em "westing."

233
00:17:24,717 --> 00:17:25,710
Weston?

234
00:17:29,134 --> 00:17:30,666
That son of a bitch.

235
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:33,093
They splashed gasoline everywhere.

236
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:34,769
They set the place on fire.

237
00:17:34,894 --> 00:17:36,573
Could you identify Weston?

238
00:17:36,698 --> 00:17:37,982
Got a pretty good look.

239
00:17:38,107 --> 00:17:41,221
Arson claims are keeping us
from collecting on a fire insurance.

240
00:17:41,346 --> 00:17:44,652
Chucky should share the information
before he goes mia again.

241
00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:47,065
Prove to them
that we didn't start the fire.

242
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:50,708
- And collect a very big check.
- Yes, sir.

243
00:17:51,276 --> 00:17:52,370
Do that.

244
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:56,449
Chucky, why don't you go
wait by the chief's car.

245
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,074
Play with the siren.

246
00:17:58,199 --> 00:17:59,244
Really?

247
00:17:59,748 --> 00:18:00,877
Sure.

248
00:18:05,902 --> 00:18:07,669
So, we planted the seed with Weston.

249
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,371
He knows about zobelle being
in bed with the Mayans.

250
00:18:10,496 --> 00:18:12,175
Zobelle'll be unprotected,

251
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,640
and Weston will be making
all his own decisions.

252
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:16,219
Hopefully irrational ones.

253
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,847
We might need help inciting him.

254
00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:23,562
See you later.

255
00:18:24,843 --> 00:18:26,146
Girl's on the move.

256
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:52,346
Where's your father?

257
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:56,801
He's the one that you're
supposed to be bringing around,

258
00:18:57,989 --> 00:19:00,300
not Zobelle's little bimbo.

259
00:19:00,425 --> 00:19:02,925
I know you listened
in on Jimmy's call.

260
00:19:03,624 --> 00:19:05,268
Now you don't need my da.

261
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:08,812
Jimmy'll be picking up the guns himself
and delivering them to Clay.

262
00:19:08,937 --> 00:19:11,612
You'll get him
and the Sons in one move.

263
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:14,956
You're not really in any
position to tell me...

264
00:19:15,081 --> 00:19:17,297
I can tip off Jimmy with a look.

265
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:21,737
He'll walk out of here with nothing and
be out of the country in a heartbeat.

266
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,566
That catholic guilt
kicking in, Eddy.

267
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,780
You feeling bad
about giving up your da?

268
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:36,007
You must be feeling real stupid
about him shaking your ATF tail.

269
00:19:40,787 --> 00:19:43,187
You know
you had better play this out

270
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:44,682
the right way.

271
00:19:47,672 --> 00:19:48,672
If I do...

272
00:19:50,915 --> 00:19:52,315
Me and my da walk?

273
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,489
When I arrest Jimmy and Clay.

274
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:03,592
But if you screw me, little boy,

275
00:20:04,694 --> 00:20:06,016
I'll bury you.

276
00:20:12,193 --> 00:20:13,409
<i>Buon giorno.</i>

277
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,066
- Where have you been?
- Just running some errands.

278
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,200
Are you okay?

279
00:20:33,906 --> 00:20:35,400
You smell of him.

280
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,670
The irishman.

281
00:20:38,142 --> 00:20:40,392
You are sleeping with him, yes?

282
00:20:40,517 --> 00:20:44,493
Or is someone else's odor
staining your fingertips.

283
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:47,829
I just went to find
out about our guns.

284
00:20:48,117 --> 00:20:50,671
And somehow that led you to his bed?

285
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,502
You have feelings for him.

286
00:20:56,595 --> 00:20:58,923
You gave our guns to the wetbacks!

287
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,150
What are you talking about?

288
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,300
- Where is Ule?
- Dead.

289
00:21:04,838 --> 00:21:06,431
So is the slave labor.

290
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,500
- What the hell have you done?
- Me?

291
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,686
You lied.

292
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,394
You race-traiting son of a bitch!

293
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,390
You lied to all of us.

294
00:21:15,494 --> 00:21:17,150
- You know who I am...
- A scumbag

295
00:21:17,691 --> 00:21:19,661
running dope with wetbacks!

296
00:21:19,786 --> 00:21:20,999
It's my job

297
00:21:21,124 --> 00:21:22,239
to think

298
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,964
about the big picture.

299
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,366
The sad truth is,

300
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:28,399
once you control the drugs,
you control the city.

301
00:21:28,524 --> 00:21:31,026
I need... We needed the mayans

302
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:32,712
to do the dirty work.

303
00:21:32,837 --> 00:21:34,709
- I did not lie to you.
- Back off.

304
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,769
Now.

305
00:21:36,894 --> 00:21:37,879
Goddamn it.

306
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,297
Get out!

307
00:21:40,204 --> 00:21:41,785
Stay calm, everybody.

308
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,366
No need for this.

309
00:21:43,773 --> 00:21:45,587
Please, please.

310
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:56,048
It wasn't about taking over cities.

311
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,670
It was about stopping color
from getting stronger.

312
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:02,625
And now, you piss
in the face of our cause:

313
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,281
White America.

314
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,949
A future for my boys.

315
00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:09,985
You make me sick.

316
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,511
Cliffy?

317
00:22:27,234 --> 00:22:29,347
- What does this mean?
- Call deputy chief Hale.

318
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,969
Tell him somebody
threatened your life.

319
00:22:32,094 --> 00:22:34,594
He will send somebody
to keep you safe.

320
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:40,858
Where are you going?

321
00:22:42,147 --> 00:22:43,897
To secure new protection.

322
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,257
What the hell is this?
I'm their father.

323
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:06,284
Your two sons
were left alone in your house

324
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:09,178
- with access to loaded firearms.
- They know how to use them.

325
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:12,015
They're not ghetto kids.
They're smart.

326
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,945
They're ten and six.
It's unconscionable.

327
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,401
- Okay, boys. I'm gonna get you out.
- That won't happen without a hearing.

328
00:23:18,526 --> 00:23:21,626
They'll be placed
in our group facility until then.

329
00:23:30,527 --> 00:23:31,677
Was this you?

330
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,960
Just protecting the children.

331
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,726
See your kids are taking
that little trip I arranged.

332
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:52,096
Son of a bitch.

333
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:54,849
I'll kill you for this.

334
00:23:56,724 --> 00:23:58,874
At least I didn't gang-rape them.

335
00:24:01,188 --> 00:24:02,688
You want to kill me?

336
00:24:03,448 --> 00:24:05,401
Time and place.

337
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,881
Timberland, 8:00.

338
00:24:09,955 --> 00:24:11,484
Your ten best against mine.

339
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:14,332
Access road l-4,
off the main lumber drive.

340
00:24:14,457 --> 00:24:16,788
No weapons.
No witnesses.

341
00:24:18,936 --> 00:24:20,333
Either you or me

342
00:24:21,175 --> 00:24:23,252
goes home in a bag.

343
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,171
I'll be there.

344
00:24:52,622 --> 00:24:55,045
Somebody called Zobelle's daughter
and threatened her life.

345
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,960
I got Ryan and Craft baby-sitting.

346
00:24:57,085 --> 00:24:58,329
This has to be Clay.

347
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,790
- That don't make sense.
- No? Does this make sense?

348
00:25:01,113 --> 00:25:03,363
Sanwa county has a triple homicide.

349
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,963
Two mexican women
and one of Zobelle's lieutenants.

350
00:25:08,129 --> 00:25:09,779
Murder wasn't Sam Crow.

351
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:11,676
They're too smart to kill innocents.

352
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:15,300
Rage I just saw, I'm sure they could
justify a little collateral damage.

353
00:25:15,425 --> 00:25:18,123
We cannot turn
a blind eye to bloodshed.

354
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:21,244
Ain't gonna be
no bloodshed in Charming.

355
00:25:21,552 --> 00:25:24,652
Just because they bury
the bodies someplace else...

356
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:27,900
Our jurisdiction begins
at the Lodi border

357
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,403
and ends at the Wahewa Land.

358
00:25:34,253 --> 00:25:36,153
I can't be that kind of cop.

359
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:38,277
You told me

360
00:25:38,682 --> 00:25:39,878
to do my job.

361
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:41,873
I know.

362
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:44,413
And I got to do mine.

363
00:25:50,234 --> 00:25:51,805
What is this?

364
00:25:52,793 --> 00:25:55,605
He's got some info
on an insurance beef.

365
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,785
I'm finished.

366
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:07,577
Grab Clemens and take an unmarked
sedan, head over to the Sons' clubhouse.

367
00:26:07,702 --> 00:26:09,823
If Jax or Clay leave,

368
00:26:09,948 --> 00:26:12,069
you put a loose tail on them,
and you let me know.

369
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:13,421
Sure.

370
00:26:13,917 --> 00:26:15,117
You want this?

371
00:26:15,746 --> 00:26:18,446
Eyewitness testimony
on the Caracara fires.

372
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:20,344
What?

373
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:22,850
Let's go.

374
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:32,331
Was your dad a catholic?

375
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:36,498
Superstious.

376
00:26:40,482 --> 00:26:41,782
You seem better.

377
00:26:43,274 --> 00:26:44,824
Little more at peace?

378
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,363
You believe in god?

379
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:58,280
Not that god.
Something.

380
00:26:58,405 --> 00:27:01,523
I believe there's something
connecting all of us.

381
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,610
You?

382
00:27:06,294 --> 00:27:08,524
I believe we all got a job to do.

383
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:10,911
Fate.

384
00:27:11,654 --> 00:27:12,654
Service.

385
00:27:13,478 --> 00:27:14,590
Our lot.

386
00:27:15,321 --> 00:27:17,379
For you, it's medicine.

387
00:27:17,728 --> 00:27:19,157
You're a healer.

388
00:27:19,401 --> 00:27:21,889
Nothing should ever
stop you from doing that.

389
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,614
For you, it's family.

390
00:27:33,545 --> 00:27:34,735
I get it now.

391
00:27:37,682 --> 00:27:40,459
God wants me to be a fierce mother.

392
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,911
That's my path.

393
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,783
<i>Plates match.
It's O'Phelan's SUV.</i>

394
00:28:14,453 --> 00:28:15,726
<i>Esperate aqui.</i>

395
00:28:23,978 --> 00:28:25,720
Guns are in the garage.

396
00:28:26,094 --> 00:28:27,094
Good.

397
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,335
- They'll load 'em.
- Where'd you get the wetback?

398
00:28:34,069 --> 00:28:35,235
Home depot.

399
00:28:35,498 --> 00:28:36,898
Short on manpower.

400
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,240
Where's your da?

401
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,305
Not sure.

402
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,055
Tell him we need to talk.

403
00:28:53,944 --> 00:28:56,194
<i>We got confirmation.
It's Jimmy O.</i>

404
00:28:57,379 --> 00:28:59,820
All right, we'll stay on the SUV;
you grab Edmond.

405
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,138
What is this?

406
00:29:10,394 --> 00:29:11,916
Target's on the move.

407
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:21,463
<i>Edmond confirmed.
Jimmy and two others in the SUV.</i>

408
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:23,986
<i>Guns on board. Picking up Edmond.</i>

409
00:29:47,277 --> 00:29:48,527
It's all clear.

410
00:30:06,457 --> 00:30:07,457
Gentlemen,

411
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:09,238
your hardware.

412
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:15,233
Bring back, bring back.

413
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:19,556
Allright, that's good.

414
00:30:19,681 --> 00:30:20,901
Get it in, boys.

415
00:30:25,514 --> 00:30:28,214
Glad we could move
past our history, Filip.

416
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:35,971
Appreciate
your reaching out to Fiona.

417
00:30:40,222 --> 00:30:44,226
Nothing happens with Fiona
that I don't know about.

418
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:47,970
How many times do I have
to teach you that lesson?

419
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:52,747
You touch her or Kerrianne,

420
00:30:53,168 --> 00:30:55,894
and I will cut you
into a million pieces.

421
00:30:58,909 --> 00:31:00,065
We okay?

422
00:31:02,523 --> 00:31:03,523
Just,

423
00:31:04,043 --> 00:31:05,143
swapping old

424
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,947
irish folktales.

425
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,165
We're done.

426
00:31:38,527 --> 00:31:39,912
We got bikers.

427
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:49,520
<i>Samcro is in the building.</i>

428
00:31:51,916 --> 00:31:52,952
Let's go.

429
00:32:07,096 --> 00:32:08,509
ATF! Everybody down!

430
00:32:23,915 --> 00:32:25,503
- Where is he?
- Jose here

431
00:32:25,628 --> 00:32:27,778
is the only one
that got out of the SUV.

432
00:32:31,298 --> 00:32:33,639
Get that irish prick in here.

433
00:32:36,877 --> 00:32:38,154
Let 'em up.

434
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,073
All right, fellas...

435
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:52,386
Where is Jimmy O?

436
00:32:52,692 --> 00:32:53,512
Jimmy who?

437
00:32:54,754 --> 00:32:55,655
Shit.

438
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,006
Whoever Jimmy is,
she doesn't like him very much.

439
00:32:58,131 --> 00:33:00,644
We're just trying to buy
some camping gear.

440
00:33:02,412 --> 00:33:03,772
Open it.

441
00:33:08,017 --> 00:33:09,436
Shit!

442
00:33:13,794 --> 00:33:17,199
- Can we go now?
- Maybe we should wait for Galt P.D.,

443
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:19,316
file some assault charges.

444
00:33:29,403 --> 00:33:31,050
You hit like a girl.

445
00:33:45,886 --> 00:33:48,484
- What the hell happened?
- Jimmy happened.

446
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:50,302
And now because of you,

447
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:52,910
me and my da are dead men.

448
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,740
You need to go find

449
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,266
your daddy and bring him to me

450
00:33:57,391 --> 00:34:00,647
because right now,
I am the only one who can pull your

451
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,414
asses out of this irish stew.

452
00:34:05,635 --> 00:34:06,794
Bring him.

453
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:08,678
Let's go.

454
00:34:15,526 --> 00:34:19,051
- I'm just completing my charts.
- That should have been done already.

455
00:34:19,176 --> 00:34:20,766
Yes, I know.

456
00:34:22,581 --> 00:34:25,229
You may not have to worry about
paperwork after next week.

457
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:30,431
I pity you.

458
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,362
You walk around here
with your little

459
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,279
administrative degree,

460
00:34:35,522 --> 00:34:37,722
pretending like you know medicine.

461
00:34:39,279 --> 00:34:40,828
You're just a cheap suit.

462
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,084
Too stupid and lazy
to get into med school.

463
00:34:43,209 --> 00:34:45,074
So now you compensate by

464
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,267
making the healers
jump through hoops.

465
00:34:52,497 --> 00:34:55,447
Someone's true colors
have finally bled through.

466
00:34:56,133 --> 00:34:59,054
I guess you and that biker whore
you travel with...

467
00:35:00,107 --> 00:35:01,598
How dare you?

468
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:05,041
You don't know her.
You don't know any of them.

469
00:35:06,053 --> 00:35:07,053
My god.

470
00:35:07,178 --> 00:35:08,397
You hit me.

471
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,149
You are finished.

472
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,767
I'm calling security.
This is assault.

473
00:35:17,827 --> 00:35:19,151
That's assault.

474
00:35:25,742 --> 00:35:29,084
I know where you live,
where your kids go to school.

475
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:32,504
Samcro has the cops on payroll,
this town in its pocket.

476
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,589
You say a word about this to anyone,
it'll be the biggest mistake

477
00:35:35,714 --> 00:35:38,389
of your little red life.
Do you...

478
00:35:38,514 --> 00:35:40,512
understand what I'm saying?

479
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:55,486
And I suggest you drop
this bogus claim against me.

480
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,731
There are a lot of people
who need my help.

481
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:20,089
I love you, baby.

482
00:37:00,961 --> 00:37:02,511
Come here. Come here.

483
00:37:06,776 --> 00:37:09,576
It'll be all right.
Let's get 'em all inside.

484
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:13,001
Come on, kids.

485
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,580
Hey, Stumpy, come with us.

486
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,600
Here they come.

487
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:54,992
What did happen to ten on ten,
no weapons?

488
00:38:55,117 --> 00:38:57,764
Guess you couldn't handle
a fair fight?

489
00:38:58,416 --> 00:38:59,987
Fair is for losers.

490
00:39:00,889 --> 00:39:02,379
I'd rather win.

491
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:06,242
Me too.

492
00:39:27,014 --> 00:39:28,907
Put your weapons down.

493
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,683
Put them down.

494
00:39:41,638 --> 00:39:43,109
Let's just stick to the plan.

495
00:39:43,234 --> 00:39:44,631
Come on.

496
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:36,141
Shit.

497
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:39,252
Let's go.

498
00:40:40,836 --> 00:40:41,836
Come on.

499
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,030
Collect everyone. Get out of here.

500
00:40:54,264 --> 00:40:55,702
We ain't done yet.

501
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,843
I'm not going anywhere.

502
00:41:00,399 --> 00:41:01,649
Son of a bitch.

503
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:08,157
Black Ford truck headed southbound.

504
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,145
Holy shit.

505
00:41:22,469 --> 00:41:24,106
This doesn't concern you.

506
00:41:24,446 --> 00:41:26,316
You're inside Charming.

507
00:41:26,605 --> 00:41:28,151
Who the hell else does it concern?

508
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,435
Go home, Deputy.

509
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,794
No crime here.

510
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,210
AJ Weston.
You are under arrest for arson.

511
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,057
Burning down Caracara.

512
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:47,404
Read him his rights. Clean him up.

513
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:54,677
Call Unser.

514
00:41:55,057 --> 00:41:57,413
Tell him to move on the cigar stuff.

515
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,919
Closing time.

516
00:42:21,312 --> 00:42:22,512
I guess it is.

517
00:42:25,645 --> 00:42:27,627
What happened to the other cops?

518
00:42:28,876 --> 00:42:29,876
They're...

519
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,288
off doing something that matters.

520
00:42:39,008 --> 00:42:40,708
What are you doing here?

521
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:42,574
Unser cut us loose.

522
00:42:43,001 --> 00:42:44,001
Shit.

523
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:45,724
Follow me.

524
00:42:53,712 --> 00:42:54,821
Where's your father?

525
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,139
I don't know.

526
00:43:00,201 --> 00:43:02,251
Now you get daddy on the phone.

527
00:43:02,876 --> 00:43:04,526
And you bring him here.

528
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,549
Or I kill his little girl.

529
00:43:07,776 --> 00:43:09,573
I don't know where he is.

530
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,425
She's as guilty as the rest.

531
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,990
Don't you move.

532
00:43:26,128 --> 00:43:27,293
Welcome back.

533
00:43:29,105 --> 00:43:30,421
What do you want?

534
00:43:30,546 --> 00:43:31,441
Talk

535
00:43:31,854 --> 00:43:33,204
outside Charming.

536
00:43:36,172 --> 00:43:37,822
You just gonna let this happen?

537
00:43:38,084 --> 00:43:39,115
Walk out the door.

538
00:43:40,171 --> 00:43:42,971
You wanna kill me.
Do it here on main street.

539
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,266
Fine.

540
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,377
I was just trying to accomodate
our friend with the badge.

541
00:43:54,116 --> 00:43:56,029
Deputy Chief. Deputy Chief.

542
00:43:56,154 --> 00:43:57,606

What are you doing?

545

My shield still outranks yours.

546
00:44:05,261 --> 00:44:06,911
And I'm telling my men,

547
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,937

Officers, my daughter and I
are in posession of illegal narcotics

There's a a lot of them under
that cash register in the center drawer.

554

You can find them here.

555
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,045
It's here.

556

Arrest us.

557
00:44:40,606 --> 00:44:41,720
Do it.

558
00:44:47,174 --> 00:44:48,174
