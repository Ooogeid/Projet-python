1
00:00:01,339 --> 00:00:03,311
Previously on Sons of Anarchy...

2
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:06,281
I don't want the ghost of John Teller
poisoning him,

3
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,089
ruining everything we've built.

4
00:00:10,251 --> 00:00:11,844
You promised
you were done with this.

5
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:14,723
You sat in a cell for five years
while Clay and the others got rich.

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,098
We're 3 months behind.

7
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,183
I don't know how to get
in front of this shit.

8
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,311
- Murder for hire.
- It's not about money.

9
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:21,937
That asshole killed McKeavy.

10
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:23,773
- Who does it?
- I do.

11
00:00:25,123 --> 00:00:27,562
I want Ope
pulling the trigger on this.

12
00:00:27,687 --> 00:00:29,694
I want to make sure
he's really back.

13
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,935
We all do.

14
00:00:35,143 --> 00:00:36,165
Shit.

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,414
Hey, Clay, I was hoping
to get my payout for Hefner.

16
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:45,812
- This should cover the mortgage.
- Who the hell are you?

17
00:00:45,937 --> 00:00:47,859
- ATF.
- Just what we need.

18
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,048
You guys want to rent
a goddamn wing?

19
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:53,061
Oakland DA's office turned up
an eyewitness to Hefner's murder,

20
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:54,336
ID'd two guys.

21
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:56,846
Dear God,
thank you for saving this boy

22
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:58,966
from his murderous junkie mom.

23
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:02,230
He will never

24
00:01:02,606 --> 00:01:03,979
call you Mommy.

25
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,773
- Now what?
- Abel stays in the toaster.

26
00:01:06,943 --> 00:01:09,389
Ship your ass off to rehab.
You got it?

27
00:01:09,627 --> 00:01:12,436
We can't keep looking the other way.
We need to think about this.

28
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:13,905
What the hell are we doing?

29
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:15,949
Your mom says
that I have to end this.

30
00:01:16,247 --> 00:01:18,952
I want you to stop listening
to my crazy mom.

31
00:01:19,188 --> 00:01:21,246
Big hijack nine years ago.

32
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,541
Type it up...
I'll sign it.

33
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,959
Want to make sure
we got it all right, please?

34
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:29,938
I'm gonna bury these assholes.

35
00:02:06,785 --> 00:02:07,918
No, me, too.

36
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:10,504
All right.
Thanks, Jace.

37
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,038
- Rosen?
- Yeah.

38
00:02:12,402 --> 00:02:13,984
Luann's in the clear.

39
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,775
- Otto, not so much.
- Why, what happened?

40
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,639
He shattered Stahl's face.

41
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,125
I love that man.

42
00:02:23,407 --> 00:02:25,872
Trying to prove to the club
he wasn't gonna give anything up.

43
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:28,480
We're clear of the ATF,
ladies and germs.

44
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,819
Now that I have you in a good mood...
Jax's house.

45
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:37,470
Just some remodeling and shit,
you know, for the baby.

46
00:02:39,497 --> 00:02:40,499
$2,300

47
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:44,914
for painting? Shit, I could have
the prospect do it for free.

48
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,083
The baby is coming home any day.
I want the house to be perfect.

49
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,754
- That's why I love you.
- Clay, cops.

50
00:02:55,874 --> 00:02:57,757
Everybody on the ground now!

51
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:04,215
Get off of me!

52
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:16,558
Robert Munson,

53
00:03:16,683 --> 00:03:18,954
you're under arrest for the murder
of Brenan Hefner.

54
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,118
- Who?
- You have the right to remain silent.

55
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,496
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

56
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,286
I'll call Rosen, Bobby.
You just sit tight.

57
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:28,059
Bitch!

58
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:30,303
Easy now!

59
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:32,491
Manners, darling.

60
00:03:32,984 --> 00:03:33,994
Manners.

61
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:39,259
They got Bobby
at Federal Plaza in Stockton.

62
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:42,679
ATF says they got an eyewitness
saw Bobby kill Hefner.

63
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,473
Is that possible?

64
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,592
From my end, it was all clear.

65
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:50,062
- Shit's a goddamn bluff.
- You can't charge somebody on a bluff.

66
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,727
Whatever they got, it's real.

67
00:03:51,852 --> 00:03:53,754
Who is the blasted witness?

68
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,847
We're a man short.

69
00:04:01,936 --> 00:04:02,986
Where's Ope?

70
00:04:06,342 --> 00:04:07,927
I called every number.

71
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:09,998
There's no answers.

72
00:04:10,498 --> 00:04:11,794
I tried Donna's phone, too.

73
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,124
Maybe Donna changed
the goddamn home phone.

74
00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:15,249
All right.

75
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:17,752
- I'll go get him.
- You better find him.

76
00:04:17,877 --> 00:04:20,749
- What the hell does that mean?
- Only two other guys

77
00:04:20,874 --> 00:04:22,375
were witness to that hit.

78
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,896
One of them's in jail,
and the other one is...

79
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:26,749
Don't even say it, asshole.

80
00:04:26,874 --> 00:04:28,375
You better curb that disrespect.

81
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,189
You better shut your goddamn mouth!

82
00:04:30,314 --> 00:04:31,856
Everybody's nerves are fried,

83
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,849
but we can't unravel here.

84
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,439
Now, Jax is gonna go get him,

85
00:04:36,564 --> 00:04:40,123
and he's gonna bring him back here.
We're gonna find out what this is.

86
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:42,471
The only reason my son isn't here

87
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:45,695
is 'cause he doesn't know
what happened.

88
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,834
Exactly.

89
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:27,543
Episode 111: Capybara

90
00:06:06,623 --> 00:06:07,623
Shit.

91
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,257
You got one minute.
ATF finds out, he'll have a fit.

92
00:06:19,382 --> 00:06:21,295
- Thanks, Candy.
- Sure thing.

93
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,935
What are you doing in here?

94
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,783
Stahl's detaining me for questioning.

95
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,002
Jesus Christ.

96
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:31,189
You got any idea
what happened to Ope?

97
00:06:31,314 --> 00:06:33,891
- His whole family's gone.
- I don't know.

98
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,002
Ask Hale.

99
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:37,177
He's Stahl's little errand boy.

100
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:38,688
He's more than that.

101
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:41,733
Other night, when we were in here,
he was face down in that shit.

102
00:06:44,123 --> 00:06:45,123
Idiot.

103
00:06:45,248 --> 00:06:47,042
I got to find Ope, man.

104
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:49,741
You hear anything, you let me know.

105
00:06:50,187 --> 00:06:51,187
Of course.

106
00:07:04,477 --> 00:07:05,616
Thanks, man.

107
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:18,062
Shit.

108
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:20,939
Of course.

109
00:07:25,616 --> 00:07:27,295
- How you doin'?
- Hi.

110
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,450
He's taking
to the bottle much better.

111
00:07:54,798 --> 00:07:56,526
How is his sleep apnea?

112
00:07:56,746 --> 00:07:59,811
The last two nights, no alarms.
He's almost through it.

113
00:07:59,936 --> 00:08:03,235
- We'll be able to take him home?
- Probably tomorrow.

114
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:05,328
You hear that, baby boy?

115
00:08:05,814 --> 00:08:07,164
You're going home.

116
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:11,685
Can I ask you a practical question?

117
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:15,743
- Who's gonna take care of him?
- I will.

118
00:08:16,022 --> 00:08:17,372
Who do you think?

119
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,689
Day and night? You ready for that?

120
00:08:19,814 --> 00:08:21,165
I think I can handle it.

121
00:08:21,395 --> 00:08:23,835
- Why?
- I don't think Jax is ready for this.

122
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:26,129
He has no idea what he's in for.

123
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:29,048
On that, we agree.

124
00:08:30,574 --> 00:08:32,558
His father was clueless, too.

125
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,059
They figure it out.

126
00:08:35,655 --> 00:08:37,098
Got no choice, right?

127
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,501
You want kids?

128
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:49,815
Sure.

129
00:08:50,565 --> 00:08:52,371
Right time, right person.

130
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,074
Getting close to finding that?

131
00:08:57,658 --> 00:08:59,245
What are you asking me, Gemma?

132
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,247
If you're in Jax's life,

133
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:03,736
you're in his life.

134
00:09:04,558 --> 00:09:07,631
I got every right to know
how you feel about kids.

135
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,500
I don't think what Jax and I have...

136
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:12,281
It's...

137
00:09:15,124 --> 00:09:16,698
We haven't discussed it.

138
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,189
Maybe you should.

139
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:21,100
Big responsibilities
come with my son.

140
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,763
You better think about that.
Figure out if you can take them on.

141
00:09:23,888 --> 00:09:27,024
I'm just spending time with Jax.
There is nothing to figure out.

142
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:28,723
If it becomes something different,

143
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:30,360
you'll be the first to know.

144
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,125
Good.

145
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,350
'Cause I don't mind playing
mommy for a while,

146
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,117
but eventually, I'd like to just

147
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,370
sit back...

148
00:09:41,418 --> 00:09:42,651
be a grandma.

149
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:49,421
- Did they take Opie out in cuffs?
- No, he was carrying one of his kids.

150
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,811
What time was that?

151
00:09:50,936 --> 00:09:52,186
Headlights woke us up.

152
00:09:52,311 --> 00:09:53,799
Must have been around 2:30.

153
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:55,791
There were three black sedans.

154
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,929
The whole family left,
took bags with them.

155
00:09:58,192 --> 00:09:59,838
Is he in trouble again?

156
00:10:00,155 --> 00:10:01,329
I don't know.

157
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:02,883
Thanks.

158
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:07,189
Just talked to our guy over
at San Joaquin Savings and Loan.

159
00:10:07,314 --> 00:10:10,062
- He checked Opie's finances.
- And?

160
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,026
Somebody paid off
a huge chunk of his debt.

161
00:10:12,342 --> 00:10:14,029
Federal wire transfer.

162
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:15,327
Mortgage,

163
00:10:15,452 --> 00:10:17,366
credit cards, car payments.

164
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,534
This stays with the three of us.

165
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:23,126
- Yeah, of course.
- Go.

166
00:10:27,906 --> 00:10:29,280
Opie sold us out.

167
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,674
Or ATF wants us to think he did.

168
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:37,518
That bitch is smart.

169
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:40,832
Devious gash.

170
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:49,124
Come on in.

171
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,193
Oh, my God, Abel.
Oh, my God, he got so big.

172
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:54,372
Look at you.

173
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,840
- Got him?
- I got him.

174
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:03,183
My God,

175
00:11:03,473 --> 00:11:05,802
- he's so beautiful.
- Yeah, he is.

176
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,770
Looks like Jax, doesn't he?

177
00:11:14,084 --> 00:11:16,491
Thank you so much.
I know you're not supposed to do this.

178
00:11:16,616 --> 00:11:17,572
It's okay.

179
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:25,629
Do you have a plan, Wendy?

180
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,853
I got into a sober living house
at Lincoln Village.

181
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:30,073
That's good.

182
00:11:33,312 --> 00:11:34,312
How's Jax?

183
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:36,800
He's okay.

184
00:11:37,658 --> 00:11:38,724
I think.

185
00:11:39,736 --> 00:11:41,262
I miss him so much.

186
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:46,766
Yeah, I can imagine.

187
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,746
Mary. Jesus Christ.

188
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:05,576
- What are you doing here?
- I was hoping you could tell me.

189
00:12:06,034 --> 00:12:09,291
Got a call from the feds,
asking me to pick up my grandkids

190
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,314
from the Department of Justice Facility
in Stockton.

191
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,192
Opie's kids are in a facility?

192
00:12:16,317 --> 00:12:18,075
Apparently, the whole family is.

193
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,487
Can't get a hold of Piney.

194
00:12:20,036 --> 00:12:24,008
Thought you might shed some light on
why I'm schlepping my fat ass 75 miles.

195
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:28,663
Let's find out.

196
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:35,420
What's Opie's mom doing here?

197
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,632
She's picking up her grandkids
from the Department of Justice Facility.

198
00:12:39,444 --> 00:12:40,877
Oh, my God.

199
00:12:41,002 --> 00:12:43,594
Opie get picked up
on the Hefner shit?

200
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:47,431
Hey, Mary.

201
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:50,976
What the hell did my kid do
this time?

202
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,893
Nice to see you too.

203
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:57,189
The feds picked him up
in the middle of the night.

204
00:12:57,314 --> 00:12:58,442
He go out in cuffs?

205
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:00,540
Neighbors say no.

206
00:13:07,365 --> 00:13:09,288
Ope's debt has been cleared.

207
00:13:09,948 --> 00:13:12,062
Federal wire transfers.

208
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:17,754
It's a setup.

209
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:18,839
Maybe.

210
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:20,884
Or...

211
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,366
he gave Bobby up.

212
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,510
Now he's got Witness Protection.

213
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:25,693
Why?

214
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:28,563
If he wasn't arrested,
what's the leverage?

215
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:31,034
Who knows how long
they've been chipping away at him, Jax?

216
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,164
Hell, ATF.

217
00:13:32,953 --> 00:13:35,515
They could've gotten to him
while he was still in Chino.

218
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,065
That's paranoid shit.

219
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,269
Is it?

220
00:13:38,758 --> 00:13:39,860
I mean, is it?

221
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,195
Opie's been a miserable prick
since he got out.

222
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,688
Maybe they've offered him a...

223
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:46,407
a new debt-free life.
Just what Donna wanted.

224
00:13:46,902 --> 00:13:48,034
Ope's not a rat.

225
00:13:48,498 --> 00:13:50,939
He did five years for this club.

226
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,705
Maybe he doesn't want to do 25 more.

227
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:59,353
I'm going to see Rosen tomorrow.
We'll get some clarity.

228
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:02,799
Give us a minute.

229
00:14:03,784 --> 00:14:04,817
Of course.

230
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,695
You and I both love Opie.

231
00:14:21,184 --> 00:14:23,806
I don't want to believe
this shit either.

232
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:26,008
But...

233
00:14:28,632 --> 00:14:32,077
we got to prepare ourselves
for a truth we may not like.

234
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:35,624
- He'd never sell out the club.
- And what if he did?

235
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,145
Then I'll kill him myself.

236
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,379
- Where's my family?
- Right down the hall.

237
00:14:53,504 --> 00:14:56,060
My people packed a few of their things,
so they're very comfortable.

238
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,842
Justice uses this facility

239
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:02,565
to transition informants
into Witness Protection, so it's...

240
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,235
What the...? Are you charging me?

241
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,566
Then you got to cut me loose.

242
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:09,505
You need to stay here, Opie...

243
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,950
for your own safety.

244
00:15:11,255 --> 00:15:12,692
For my own safety?

245
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:15,413
You see, we have an eyewitness

246
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,424
who saw two men gun down
Brenan Hefner.

247
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,419
Bobby Munson
was positively identified,

248
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:24,922
and your ID could take
a little court time,

249
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,183
but it'll happen.

250
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:30,426
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

251
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,277
You see, she didn't get

252
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:42,363
the eyes or the nose quite right.

253
00:15:43,252 --> 00:15:45,441
That's why it fell short
of a positive ID.

254
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:47,529
- I want my lawyer.
- I'm sure

255
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:51,016
that Sam Crow knows
that you and your family are gone.

256
00:15:51,635 --> 00:15:54,587
And lots of your neighbors
saw you get into our big,

257
00:15:54,712 --> 00:15:56,413
comfortable, black sedan.

258
00:15:56,837 --> 00:15:58,006
No cuffs.

259
00:15:58,131 --> 00:16:00,709
And what,
with all the inconvenience,

260
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:03,450
I figured
the least I could do was...

261
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,984
pay off some of those big bills
of yours.

262
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,903
You crazy bitch.

263
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:18,017
You're setting me up as the rat.

264
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:22,564
Unfortunately,
I think it's going to play out that way.

265
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,566
What the hell is she doing?

266
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:30,230
- They'll know I wasn't the witness.
- Eventually.

267
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:32,606
But you see, the US Attorney
won't release the identity

268
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:35,869
of the witness until pre-trial,
and that could take weeks.

269
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,280
I can only hold you for 48 hours.

270
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:40,316
Now what is going to happen

271
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,003
when I put you and your family
back in Charming, hmm?

272
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:48,465
- I tell the club the truth.
- And maybe they believe you...

273
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,635
but maybe they don't.

274
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:57,694
Are you really willing to risk
the life of your family

275
00:16:57,819 --> 00:17:00,369
on the love
that Clay Morrow has for you?

276
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:08,985
What if this rat trap backfires?

277
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:12,488
- Clay will kill this poor guy.
- Poor guy?

278
00:17:12,985 --> 00:17:15,709
This scumbag
just killed a state official.

279
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:19,224
He spent five years
in jail for arson.

280
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:21,474
He is not a "poor guy."

281
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:22,820
Look,

282
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:24,505
I get it. Okay?

283
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,378
They hurt you
and you're pissed off...

284
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,795
Please. Save it, okay. Save it!

285
00:17:29,974 --> 00:17:32,299
This is not personal. All right?

286
00:17:33,006 --> 00:17:36,156
I can take a few knocks.
My God, it's part of my job.

287
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:38,013
But you know what?

288
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:40,205
If you can't detach yourself

289
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,823
from your history
with these shitheads,

290
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,564
then maybe you better shuffle
on back to Mayberry.

291
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,167
I know these guys.

292
00:17:49,065 --> 00:17:50,401
And what you are doing

293
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,421
and how you are doing it...

294
00:17:54,848 --> 00:17:56,032
it is wrong.

295
00:17:56,421 --> 00:17:58,294
Someone's going to get hurt.

296
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,792
I'm sorry.

297
00:18:10,449 --> 00:18:11,553
Okay? I'm...

298
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,567
I'm sorry that I snapped at you.

299
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:17,943
It's been a tough couple of days...

300
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:20,679
You're right.

301
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:25,728
I appreciate your concern, David.

302
00:18:47,912 --> 00:18:49,002
You doing okay?

303
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,260
I don't think he's hungry.

304
00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:55,506
Someone's here to see you.

305
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,224
You do this?

306
00:19:03,532 --> 00:19:05,020
She came on her own.

307
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,398
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

308
00:19:12,895 --> 00:19:14,492
Need me to sign that?

309
00:19:16,641 --> 00:19:17,738
You left rehab?

310
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:20,304
No.

311
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,756
I'm moving into a sober living house

312
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:24,331
in Lincoln Village.

313
00:19:25,654 --> 00:19:26,945
I have 64 days.

314
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:29,268
That's fantastic.

315
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,253
You look great.

316
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:34,693
Thanks.

317
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:37,230
So...

318
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:41,012
I was just hoping
I could see Abel before I go.

319
00:19:42,504 --> 00:19:44,890
- Of course, I think that would be good.
- All right.

320
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:46,297
Come on.

321
00:19:47,484 --> 00:19:49,113
Shit, Jax. Wait.

322
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:52,909
I saw him already today.
I'm sorry. I couldn't wait.

323
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,866
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

324
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,355
- You want to see him again?
- I really do.

325
00:20:05,193 --> 00:20:07,474
Hey, buddy.
It's okay.

326
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:09,197
I got you.

327
00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:11,628
Hey, buddy.

328
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,856
Hey, it's okay.

329
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:16,379
It's all right.

330
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,850
It's okay.

331
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:25,870
I was just feeding him.

332
00:20:28,472 --> 00:20:30,018
You want to eat something?

333
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,074
That's my boy.

334
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:34,147
You got someplace to stay?

335
00:20:35,482 --> 00:20:36,482
Ramada.

336
00:20:39,275 --> 00:20:41,636
I got to stay away from
all my old friends, you know?

337
00:20:43,104 --> 00:20:44,104
Yeah.

338
00:20:44,935 --> 00:20:46,633
We changed the locks at the house.

339
00:20:46,758 --> 00:20:48,106
Yeah, I know.

340
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:50,219
The back door was open and I just...

341
00:20:50,564 --> 00:20:52,175
I left my bags there, but...

342
00:20:52,717 --> 00:20:54,263
Well, I'm not in there yet, so...

343
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:56,295
if you want to stay
until you check in...

344
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:57,631
What about Gemma?

345
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,715
Yeah, good point.

346
00:21:00,865 --> 00:21:02,622
Ramada's probably safer.

347
00:21:06,193 --> 00:21:07,554
Super sweet.

348
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,308
My God.

349
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,719
You can watch TV if you like.

350
00:21:47,844 --> 00:21:50,432
And if you need anything,
just let Agent Haddie know.

351
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:54,005
Is she the girl who saw
Bobby kill the port commissioner?

352
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,803
Yeah.
It's Eviqua Michaels.

353
00:21:55,928 --> 00:21:59,224
We're transferring her to
a safe house until after the trial.

354
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:01,985
Then Eviqua Michaels
becomes Jane Doe.

355
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:04,398
I'll see you later.

356
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:07,449
Deputy Chief Hale, I've been instructed
to escort you from the building.

357
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:09,448
What are you talking about?

358
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,607
Agent Stahl's request.

359
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,839
Little family reunion?

360
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:26,347
- How long you been watching?
- Since 1978.

361
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:28,657
She just wants to hold her kid.

362
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:31,056
You of all people should get that.

363
00:22:31,514 --> 00:22:33,751
You think she has a right
to hold that baby?

364
00:22:33,876 --> 00:22:35,609
As much of a right as I do.

365
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:39,022
Look, Mom, I wasn't shooting crank,
but I bailed on that kid, too.

366
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:43,692
I'm making up for that now.
She just wants the same chance.

367
00:22:47,188 --> 00:22:48,156
She clean?

368
00:22:48,486 --> 00:22:49,486
Yeah.

369
00:22:49,793 --> 00:22:52,043
Checking into a halfway
house next week.

370
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:54,435
Staying at the Ramada till then.

371
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:02,337
Her bags are at your house.
She might as well stay there.

372
00:23:03,473 --> 00:23:04,473
Really?

373
00:23:05,165 --> 00:23:08,176
Well, you said she's trying
to make up for her mistake.

374
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:12,740
- I'm all about second chances.
- No, you're not.

375
00:23:16,235 --> 00:23:18,687
So anything new on Ope and Bobby?

376
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,171
No, nothing.

377
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:23,928
I don't care what anybody says.

378
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,445
Opie didn't rat.

379
00:23:26,745 --> 00:23:27,745
I know.

380
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:30,160
Thanks, Mom.

381
00:23:38,908 --> 00:23:40,834
Tell me what the hell is going on.

382
00:23:43,203 --> 00:23:44,796
See if the kids want some ice cream.

383
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,157
Sure.

384
00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:48,995
Is that okay with you?

385
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
Yeah.

386
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:51,344
Kids?

387
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:53,540
Go with the lady.

388
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:54,789
Kenny!
Come on.

389
00:23:56,432 --> 00:23:58,769
Go with the lady, okay?
She's going to get you some ice cream.

390
00:24:06,437 --> 00:24:07,815
You recently...

391
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:12,344
paid off three months of back
mortgage on your house, in cash.

392
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:14,941
Where did it come from?

393
00:24:17,926 --> 00:24:20,999
You spent it, you fed your kids on it.
How was it earned?

394
00:24:21,524 --> 00:24:22,737
I don't know.

395
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:23,919
I didn't ask.

396
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:29,104
You know,  your family is falling apart.
Now, I want to help you, but...

397
00:24:29,229 --> 00:24:32,273
Don't pretend you give
a shit about my family.

398
00:24:33,508 --> 00:24:35,454
We arrested Bobby Elvis for murder.

399
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:37,077
An eyewitness ID'd him

400
00:24:38,385 --> 00:24:40,624
and this man.
Look familiar?

401
00:24:41,663 --> 00:24:44,773
I don't think that Opie pulled
the trigger, but he was there.

402
00:24:50,336 --> 00:24:52,827
- Is he going back to jail?
- Not yet, no.

403
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:56,699
But the US Attorney hasn't released
the name of the witness.

404
00:24:56,824 --> 00:24:58,619
And as far as Sam Crow is concerned,

405
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:01,998
only one person saw
Bobby commit that murder:

406
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:03,589
Opie.

407
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,979
That's why you're here,

408
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,928
for your own protection.

409
00:25:08,617 --> 00:25:11,060
Clay and his crew
think that Opie has turned.

410
00:25:11,525 --> 00:25:12,379
God...

411
00:25:12,504 --> 00:25:16,005
Do you have any idea
what these guys do to a rat?

412
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:23,883
No, Jax wouldn't let
anything happen to Opie.

413
00:25:24,428 --> 00:25:26,356
They've known each other
since they were kids.

414
00:25:28,754 --> 00:25:31,714
Well, I certainly hope that Jax
has enough pull to make that happen,

415
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,073
because I can only protect
him for one more day.

416
00:25:35,373 --> 00:25:37,659
Without my help,
this thing goes one of two ways:

417
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:39,255
Opie is in prison

418
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:41,413
or he's dead.

419
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:52,963
Are the kids okay?

420
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:56,347
Yeah,

421
00:25:56,566 --> 00:25:58,249
your mom's coming to get them.

422
00:25:58,664 --> 00:25:59,664
My mom?

423
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,123
You're serious?

424
00:26:01,248 --> 00:26:02,694
ATF spooked my family.

425
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:05,061
Mary's the only one
who's willing to come down.

426
00:26:06,213 --> 00:26:08,311
The kids would be
better off in foster care.

427
00:26:08,436 --> 00:26:09,524
Don't say that.

428
00:26:10,664 --> 00:26:11,698
I'm sorry.

429
00:26:17,051 --> 00:26:19,699
Stahl said the club
thinks you turned on them.

430
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:23,371
They hauled us in here
to make it look like we took a deal.

431
00:26:23,706 --> 00:26:25,986
Bitch hung me out as a rat.

432
00:26:26,523 --> 00:26:29,040
Hoped that she could scare me
into giving up something about a crime

433
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:30,503
that I knew nothing about.

434
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,965
They have a witness
who saw Bobby and you.

435
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:37,093
That's bullshit.

436
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:42,015
I didn't kill anyone.

437
00:26:47,845 --> 00:26:50,315
They can give us
a chance to start over, Ope.

438
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,195
Shouldn't we look
at that for the kids?

439
00:26:54,496 --> 00:26:55,496
Donna...

440
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:59,675
witness protection is a joke.

441
00:27:00,862 --> 00:27:03,982
She tell you that most
of the guys go back to the life?

442
00:27:04,804 --> 00:27:05,838
Or end up dead.

443
00:27:07,413 --> 00:27:10,919
Usually by their own hand,
because they can't stand living a lie.

444
00:27:14,272 --> 00:27:16,036
Is that what you want for me?

445
00:27:19,295 --> 00:27:22,662
- I want us to be a family.
- Getting in bed with these people

446
00:27:22,787 --> 00:27:25,892
is going to be the worst thing
that ever happened to our family.

447
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:31,361
You've got to trust me.

448
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,393
What are you gonna do, miss Donna?

449
00:27:42,473 --> 00:27:45,036
You killed a state official, Bobby.

450
00:27:45,434 --> 00:27:47,724
The US Attorney will
seek the death penalty.

451
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:51,376
I didn't kill anybody.
Anybody who says I did is lying.

452
00:27:51,787 --> 00:27:55,497
And if you have anything else to say,
why don't you talk to my lawyer.

453
00:27:56,601 --> 00:28:00,336
Well, if my witness
statement is a lie,

454
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:03,031
then maybe you
should hear all of it.

455
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:06,516
Yeah, I like a good story.

456
00:28:10,715 --> 00:28:13,664
Hefner got spooked
by something that Opie did,

457
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:15,793
turned back to you.

458
00:28:15,918 --> 00:28:19,788
You jammed your gun
in his sternum and fired four shots.

459
00:28:20,812 --> 00:28:22,394
Hefner fell.

460
00:28:22,637 --> 00:28:24,701
You and Opie fled the balcony,

461
00:28:24,968 --> 00:28:27,583
and met up downstairs with...

462
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:29,235
Jax Teller.

463
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:34,728
Jax was a lookout,

464
00:28:35,501 --> 00:28:36,869
and drove the car.

465
00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:40,370
Great fiction.

466
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:42,660
Eyewitness fiction.

467
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:51,768
Where are the kids?

468
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,568
Cafeteria, finishing dinner.

469
00:28:55,341 --> 00:28:57,078
Thanks for picking them up.

470
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,909
Don't know how much fun
they're going to have with me.

471
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:02,489
They like your dogs.

472
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,273
One of them died.

473
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,119
Want to tell me
what's going on here?

474
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,576
They think Opie might
be involved in a shooting.

475
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,377
Sweetheart,

476
00:29:15,905 --> 00:29:17,962
you're not in lockdown
for "might be."

477
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,683
This shit never ends.

478
00:29:21,767 --> 00:29:24,342
- He's going to be back in jail.
- He's your son.

479
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:27,476
He's a criminal,
just like his father.

480
00:29:27,795 --> 00:29:31,130
- Opie made his choice.
- He was 16 when you bailed.

481
00:29:33,303 --> 00:29:35,355
I took Opie with me,

482
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:38,051
to get away from all this shit.

483
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:41,213
He's the one who ran
back to his old man, the club.

484
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:43,078
His problems aren't mine.

485
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,155
If you have half a brain,

486
00:29:46,427 --> 00:29:48,424
you will take these kids

487
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:50,299
and move to another planet.

488
00:29:51,086 --> 00:29:53,113
Before their father poisons them!

489
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,242
Jax said it was
okay if I stayed here.

490
00:30:17,948 --> 00:30:18,948
Yeah.

491
00:30:19,378 --> 00:30:20,378
It is.

492
00:30:21,831 --> 00:30:22,831
Okay.

493
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:27,949
Sit down.

494
00:30:38,226 --> 00:30:39,491
How much time you got?

495
00:30:40,642 --> 00:30:41,866
64 days.

496
00:30:44,534 --> 00:30:46,934
Not gonna make
any promises this time.

497
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:49,179
I guess,
we'll just see what happens.

498
00:30:51,123 --> 00:30:53,120
Abel comes home tomorrow.

499
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:54,645
I know.

500
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,454
He's a lucky kid.

501
00:30:58,096 --> 00:31:00,857
He's got a crazy fierce
grandma looking after him.

502
00:31:01,597 --> 00:31:02,597
Yeah.

503
00:31:02,935 --> 00:31:03,935
He does.

504
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:07,080
I'm not seeking custody, Gemma.

505
00:31:07,205 --> 00:31:10,044
I just went by there,
'cause I wanted to see him,

506
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:12,739
and just say sorry for what I did.

507
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:14,971
Amends.

508
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,008
Yeah.

509
00:31:20,391 --> 00:31:21,391
Well,

510
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,292
I guess I...

511
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:25,585
guess I owe you some.

512
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:28,453
Shit I did to you.

513
00:31:32,395 --> 00:31:34,630
All a reaction to him almost dying.

514
00:31:35,502 --> 00:31:36,502
I know.

515
00:31:38,706 --> 00:31:40,115
We all pulled through.

516
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:43,586
I guess we did.

517
00:31:57,951 --> 00:31:59,385
You still love Jax?

518
00:32:03,949 --> 00:32:06,155
- Sure, I guess.
- No.

519
00:32:07,057 --> 00:32:08,385
It's not a guess.

520
00:32:09,814 --> 00:32:11,517
He's still your husband.

521
00:32:12,175 --> 00:32:14,172
The father of your child.

522
00:32:15,474 --> 00:32:16,775
Do you love him?

523
00:32:17,866 --> 00:32:18,866
Yeah.

524
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:22,178
You want this family back together?

525
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:26,186
I don't know if I'm ready for that.

526
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,950
When you're ready...

527
00:32:30,068 --> 00:32:31,791
You want this family back?

528
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,302
It's the only thing I want.

529
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,292
Abel needs his mom.

530
00:32:45,735 --> 00:32:47,338
Jax needs his wife.

531
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:50,913
You stay clean,

532
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,893
pull your shit together;

533
00:32:54,554 --> 00:32:55,629
I will do

534
00:32:55,993 --> 00:32:58,740
whatever I can to help
make that happen.

535
00:33:05,994 --> 00:33:07,459
You get some sleep.

536
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,150
We got a big day tomorrow.

537
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:11,990
Shitload of stuff

538
00:33:12,477 --> 00:33:15,197
to get together for
his coming home party.

539
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:18,906
Good night, baby.

540
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:29,891
You know that I'll be
picking you up again, Ope.

541
00:33:30,016 --> 00:33:32,564
As soon as they put this case together,
you will be tried for murder.

542
00:33:32,689 --> 00:33:34,211
I guess I'll see you then.

543
00:33:34,899 --> 00:33:38,502
Going back to the club is a mistake.
It puts you and your family at risk.

544
00:33:38,627 --> 00:33:40,141
I can protect my family.

545
00:33:40,722 --> 00:33:42,064
Do you believe that?

546
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:45,901
You need to start
thinking about your kids.

547
00:33:46,514 --> 00:33:49,037
Donna, what kind of mother
are you gonna be?

548
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,782
The kind who doesn't bail
on her family.

549
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:00,348
Let's go.

550
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,548
- Did you cover it?
- Yeah.

551
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:14,592
I got mics and trackers
in his cell phone, bike, and truck.

552
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:16,251
Good.
Stay on him.

553
00:34:16,843 --> 00:34:18,596
I want to know his every move.

554
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,712
I gotta keep this shithead alive.

555
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:26,596
Ope left Stockton.

556
00:34:26,721 --> 00:34:28,508
He wants to come in,
tell us what happened.

557
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,263
That's good.
We all want that.

558
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,022
I need to know he's gonna be safe.

559
00:34:35,147 --> 00:34:36,917
Despite all the shit
we think we know.

560
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:39,595
Ope's a member of this club.
He's gonna get his time.

561
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,577
Safe room.

562
00:34:42,584 --> 00:34:43,584
Yeah.

563
00:34:44,576 --> 00:34:47,086
I gotta go see Rosen,
make sure Bobby's okay.

564
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:48,274
You tell Ope

565
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:51,328
- he comes in when I get back, okay?
- All right.

566
00:35:00,661 --> 00:35:02,860
US Attorney won't disclose
the name of the witness

567
00:35:02,985 --> 00:35:05,292
- because of security issues.
- No ideas?

568
00:35:05,847 --> 00:35:07,398
I talked to Bobby last night.

569
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:09,729
He says Stahl knows there
was a third man.

570
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:11,065
She knows it was Jax.

571
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:14,317
Bobby said anyone who saw him
could never have ID'd Jax.

572
00:35:14,442 --> 00:35:17,279
Only one other guy
knows that Jax was there.

573
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,131
That's my guess.

574
00:35:19,256 --> 00:35:20,992
Looks like Opie Winston is turning.

575
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,327
So why would
the feds cut Opie loose?

576
00:35:23,452 --> 00:35:25,850
Why would they let him come
and plead his innocence to the club?

577
00:35:25,975 --> 00:35:27,640
Well, if I was gonna cross-examine,

578
00:35:27,765 --> 00:35:30,918
I'd argue that Opie is a criminal
and he's lying to make a cushy deal.

579
00:35:31,584 --> 00:35:34,280
He might need more evidence
to get Witness Protection.

580
00:35:34,926 --> 00:35:36,530
You think they're gonna wire him?

581
00:35:36,655 --> 00:35:39,384
He gets Jax talking
about the alleged Hefner kill.

582
00:35:39,627 --> 00:35:41,262
- It's a lock.
- Jesus Christ.

583
00:35:52,325 --> 00:35:54,449
- Gonna make this right, bro.
- Yeah.

584
00:35:59,693 --> 00:36:00,693
Look,

585
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:05,273
you're trying to push me off this thing
that happened. You're just trying to...

586
00:36:05,398 --> 00:36:07,205
trying to watch my back.

587
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,660
Come on, they're all waitin'.

588
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:23,429
Piney, your boy's here.

589
00:36:26,023 --> 00:36:27,466
How you doing, son?

590
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:29,594
I'm good, Pop.

591
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,719
I'm good.

592
00:36:31,288 --> 00:36:32,748
Good to see you.
Welcome home.

593
00:36:32,873 --> 00:36:34,090
- You okay?
- Yeah.

594
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:35,942
Check it all.

595
00:36:38,919 --> 00:36:39,919
Opie.

596
00:36:42,598 --> 00:36:43,598
Go on in.

597
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,952
Hold on.
Phones, please.

598
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:54,001
Clay?

599
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:55,473
Thank you.

600
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:11,132
- Where's Tig?
- He'll be here in a minute.

601
00:37:12,995 --> 00:37:14,761
I appreciate you coming in, Ope.

602
00:37:15,298 --> 00:37:17,720
- Says a lot.
- Says he's not a rat.

603
00:37:21,174 --> 00:37:24,073
I got one member in jail,
and another in a Wit Pro facility.

604
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,200
You can understand my worry.

605
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:29,280
Yeah, I know how this looks,

606
00:37:29,405 --> 00:37:30,881
what Stahl's done.

607
00:37:31,684 --> 00:37:33,670
She set me up to look like a rat.

608
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:35,167
It's all a lie.

609
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,068
She threatened me with my own club.

610
00:37:37,193 --> 00:37:40,631
I don't know who the hell the witness
is, but it sure as shit ain't me.

611
00:38:10,638 --> 00:38:13,603
She tried to turn Donna against me.
Offered her that whole

612
00:38:14,135 --> 00:38:16,072
Wit Pro bull shit dream.

613
00:38:17,547 --> 00:38:19,712
But she turned it down.
She could have walked away.

614
00:38:20,187 --> 00:38:22,214
Trusted me that if I came in here
and had the chance

615
00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:25,384
to tell you guys the truth
that I could make this right.

616
00:38:39,533 --> 00:38:42,163
- Sorry.
- I was just saying getting squeezed

617
00:38:42,288 --> 00:38:45,456
made me realize that I can't do this
with one foot out the door. I'm here.

618
00:38:46,638 --> 00:38:47,638
I'm in.

619
00:38:47,854 --> 00:38:48,949
No more doubt.

620
00:38:49,074 --> 00:38:50,491
No more mistakes.

621
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:55,289
You're a good man, Ope.

622
00:38:59,276 --> 00:39:00,999
Am I good with you, Clay?

623
00:39:01,227 --> 00:39:02,227
The MC?

624
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:11,559
Yeah.

625
00:39:13,325 --> 00:39:14,225
We're good.

626
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:21,691
Good news, big fella.

627
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:22,934
Good news.

628
00:39:25,315 --> 00:39:26,855
I'm proud of you, son.

629
00:39:30,912 --> 00:39:32,739
See, it's all good, bro.

630
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:36,222
You're back, big fella.

631
00:39:48,532 --> 00:39:50,761
Think I can buy you kids a drink?

632
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:52,633
A beer will do.

633
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:04,525
Room is clean.

634
00:40:05,122 --> 00:40:06,156
Anything?

635
00:40:06,947 --> 00:40:08,425
His truck was wired.

636
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,507
The phone was wired.

637
00:40:10,632 --> 00:40:11,991
And I killed 'em both.

638
00:40:12,853 --> 00:40:13,920
Jesus Christ.

639
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:16,542
Opie has turned on us.

640
00:40:17,268 --> 00:40:19,367
This has got to happen, Clay.

641
00:40:29,129 --> 00:40:31,389
Jax will never be able to hurt him.

642
00:40:33,701 --> 00:40:36,131
Take this to a vote.
I've seen this shit before.

643
00:40:36,256 --> 00:40:38,559
I mean, this kind of shit
that can crush a charter.

644
00:40:39,055 --> 00:40:40,532
Then we do it quiet.

645
00:40:41,551 --> 00:40:42,584
Me and you.

646
00:40:43,476 --> 00:40:44,619
For Bobby.

647
00:40:45,065 --> 00:40:46,283
For the club.

648
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:53,087
We need total deniability.

649
00:40:55,107 --> 00:40:56,587
This death never...

650
00:40:57,441 --> 00:40:58,537
lands at our feet.

651
00:40:59,944 --> 00:41:01,162
I understand.

652
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:07,276
What's going on?

653
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:10,633
I'm just catching Tig up
on what he missed.

654
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:13,618
Yeah, it's all good, brother.
It's all good.

655
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,187
Everything Opie said...

656
00:41:23,984 --> 00:41:25,711
you believe him, right?

657
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:28,677
- I mean, he's clear of this shit now?
- Of course.

658
00:41:30,146 --> 00:41:31,987
I love Opie, too, bro.

659
00:41:33,974 --> 00:41:34,994
Come on.

660
00:41:38,493 --> 00:41:40,211
Let's go join the party.

661
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,786
Santiag Team: michvanilly, Tagne
