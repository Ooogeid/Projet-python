1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,002
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:03,127 --> 00:00:04,631
Found a box in the storage unit.

3
00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:07,840
It's, like, pictures and journals.
Things I never knew about him.

4
00:00:08,367 --> 00:00:11,293
This was in one of his boxes.
He wrote it all down.

5
00:00:11,418 --> 00:00:13,763
John is speaking to him
from the goddamn grave.

6
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,598
<i>To my oldest, wisest friend,</i>

7
00:00:15,723 --> 00:00:17,341
<i>what we started was a good thing.</i>

8
00:00:17,466 --> 00:00:19,518
<i>This book is for all the things
we wanted,</i>

9
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,437
<i>and for all the things
we still can be.</i>

10
00:00:21,606 --> 00:00:22,897
Time for a change.

11
00:00:23,451 --> 00:00:26,859
Something's trickling down from the top
of Mt. Whitey. Not sure what.

12
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:29,078
Like you to meet Ethan Zobelle.

13
00:00:29,322 --> 00:00:32,239
- AJ Weston.
- I know who you are: white hate.

14
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,889
Sam Crow has sabotaged

15
00:00:34,014 --> 00:00:36,496
every major development effort
that's come through Charming.

16
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:37,995
That's gotta change.

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,374
That salvation,
that's your tidy real estate profit.

18
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,249
Progress has its rewards.

19
00:00:42,427 --> 00:00:43,542
From Ethan Zobelle.

20
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:45,878
It's not a bribe.
A grand opening coupon.

21
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:49,048
My baby swallowed something!
He's choking! Please help me!

22
00:00:52,784 --> 00:00:55,113
I need you to pass on
a message to your old man.

23
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:57,890
Tell him to stop selling guns
to niggers and wetbacks

24
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,358
or we find you and we do this again.

25
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:03,604
- Oh, my god.
- Promise me

26
00:01:03,903 --> 00:01:05,147
you won't tell anyone.

27
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,064
Not Clay, not Jax,

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,275
no one.

29
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:11,056
Sorry, ma'am.

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,030
Good morning.

31
00:01:24,653 --> 00:01:25,903
Baby with Nita?

32
00:01:26,498 --> 00:01:27,598
At the park.

33
00:01:29,296 --> 00:01:31,496
- Jax?
- Cleaning out the garage.

34
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,933
You still that sore?

35
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:43,509
Now it's getting worse.

36
00:01:43,922 --> 00:01:45,722
I'm just so goddamn stiff.

37
00:01:46,997 --> 00:01:48,148
Are you dry?

38
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,720
Like the Mojave vagina.

39
00:01:52,735 --> 00:01:54,035
It's the stress.

40
00:01:55,235 --> 00:01:57,885
Your body isn't producing
enough estrogen.

41
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:01,245
I'll write you a prescription.

42
00:02:02,796 --> 00:02:04,496
- Hey, ma.
- Hi, honey.

43
00:02:06,985 --> 00:02:09,235
Did you take a box of clothes
from the garage?

44
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,560
I haven't done anything out there.

45
00:02:12,584 --> 00:02:13,924
I'm missing a box.

46
00:02:15,988 --> 00:02:19,233
I cleaned some shit out there
before the baby came home.

47
00:02:19,358 --> 00:02:21,974
It was a box of laundry.
It had a serious stink to it.

48
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:23,893
Well, where is it?

49
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:25,853
Tossed it.

50
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:29,528
Just a bunch of old t-shirts,
funky underwear.

51
00:02:31,855 --> 00:02:32,855
Why?

52
00:02:38,798 --> 00:02:40,493
What are you looking for?

53
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:43,736
An old Harley manual, hard to find.

54
00:02:46,362 --> 00:02:47,362
Sorry.

55
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,838
- Good morning, children.
- Hello.

56
00:02:53,322 --> 00:02:55,429
I thought the Prospect was with you.

57
00:02:55,554 --> 00:02:57,356
The wee man
goes under the knife today.

58
00:02:57,481 --> 00:03:00,221
- He's gettin' his sack filled.
- Excuse me?

59
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,310
He's completing himself.

60
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:04,415
We're supposed
to meet Clay at the shop.

61
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,610
I'm ready.

62
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:07,489
Dump these in my truck.

63
00:03:08,798 --> 00:03:11,548
- Pleasure.
- Remember breakfast with daddy?

64
00:03:12,554 --> 00:03:14,654
Kippers and oatcakes, delicious.

65
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:24,345
- See you later.
- Bye, babe.

66
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:52,162
I think it's flat.

67
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:55,426
Went out on 18.

68
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:58,235
You rode on this all the way
from the highway?

69
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,672
It's bad, isn't it?

70
00:03:59,797 --> 00:04:01,047
The rim's shot.

71
00:04:01,612 --> 00:04:04,451
- Alignment's probably out of whack.
- Will it take long?

72
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,864
We don't stock hybrids.
It'll take a few hours.

73
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:07,989
Shit.

74
00:04:10,297 --> 00:04:12,084
You're one of Luann's girls.

75
00:04:12,755 --> 00:04:13,755
Lyla.

76
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:15,237
Opie.

77
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,489
I know.

78
00:04:17,485 --> 00:04:20,301
- Can you get me the number for a cab?
- You going to the studio?

79
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:23,621
I have to get him to school first.

80
00:04:25,423 --> 00:04:27,808
Dog can give you a lift.
If you don't mind a tow truck.

81
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,676
Really? That'd be great.

82
00:04:33,048 --> 00:04:35,316
You mind giving her a lift
to Luann's studio?

83
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,321
Car should be ready this afternoon.

84
00:04:42,627 --> 00:04:44,527
- Great. Thank you.
- Sure.

85
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:08,750
Just wanted to check in,
see how Charming was treating you.

86
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,249
It's a unique little town.

87
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,683
I understand your devotion.

88
00:05:14,301 --> 00:05:15,451
And business?

89
00:05:15,576 --> 00:05:16,726
It's growing.

90
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:19,099
Glad to hear it.

91
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,674
Did you get my proposal
on the Oswald property?

92
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:24,857
Yes, I did.
It's an ambitious development.

93
00:05:25,112 --> 00:05:26,492
And a lucrative one.

94
00:05:27,174 --> 00:05:30,113
When this land becomes available,
I will need capital investors.

95
00:05:30,238 --> 00:05:32,988
- If this land becomes available.
- It will.

96
00:05:33,737 --> 00:05:35,987
I'll be happy to make some calls
on your behalf.

97
00:05:36,112 --> 00:05:39,314
But I have to be honest, Jacob.

98
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,175
It's difficult to get support
for someone who is not...

99
00:05:43,688 --> 00:05:44,738
affiliated.

100
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:48,385
This is our...

101
00:05:49,552 --> 00:05:51,202
membership coordinator.

102
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:59,525
- And this problem?
- On their way to being a footnote.

103
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,615
You want us outside?

104
00:06:13,524 --> 00:06:14,924
If you don't mind.

105
00:06:18,188 --> 00:06:19,169
How you doing?

106
00:06:30,563 --> 00:06:31,913
I'll be in touch.

107
00:06:38,512 --> 00:06:40,662
Man, that's a sweet, sweet smell.

108
00:06:41,236 --> 00:06:42,536
It's panamanian.

109
00:06:43,955 --> 00:06:45,405
I thought it was...

110
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:49,182
time I come by,
give you a proper welcome.

111
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:53,285
I don't know if you know this,
but...

112
00:06:54,301 --> 00:06:56,132
a lot of the shopkeepers
around here...

113
00:06:56,257 --> 00:06:59,857
Kick up an exorbitant vig
for the seed money you loaned them.

114
00:07:00,194 --> 00:07:01,444
As you can see,

115
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:03,505
I don't need startup.

116
00:07:04,184 --> 00:07:06,334
But you're gonna need protection.

117
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,897
Keep this beautiful setup

118
00:07:09,365 --> 00:07:11,865
from turning into,
say, that crank lab.

119
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,110
You're adding extortion

120
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:16,420
and graft to your résumé.

121
00:07:16,878 --> 00:07:19,645
Seems awfully nefarious
for mechanics

122
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,569
and Harley enthusiasts.

123
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:24,258
You pay or you go away.

124
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:26,874
Your choice, Adolf.

125
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,440
We start slow.

126
00:07:29,888 --> 00:07:30,657
A grand,

127
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:33,519
first of every month.

128
00:07:42,015 --> 00:07:43,515
Welcome to Charming.

129
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:00,421
Stockton called.

130
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:02,564
Inside's a go.

131
00:08:04,398 --> 00:08:05,548
And out here,

132
00:08:06,365 --> 00:08:08,976
we need to humble Mr. Morrow.

133
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:12,071
Yes, sir.

134
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,439
You, let's go.

135
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:07,889
- Hold him!
- Grab his arms!

136
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,036
Beating was from the league!

137
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:16,930
This is from me.

138

<i>Riding through this world</i>

Episode 205: Smite

149
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:10,835
What are you doing here?

150
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:13,679
I just had a visit from Clay Morrow

151
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:16,323
trying to extort protection money.

152
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:18,825
Figured it was a good time
for us to reconnect,

153
00:10:19,242 --> 00:10:20,692
assess our options.

154
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:26,764
That's Sam Crow blowing up
a private residence.

155
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:28,427
Arson,

156
00:10:28,702 --> 00:10:29,841
vigilantism.

157
00:10:31,355 --> 00:10:33,215
Torching the meth lab
that you financed?

158
00:10:33,544 --> 00:10:36,094
A laundry list
of potential convictions.

159
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:40,928
I can't just toss around photos
and DVDs

160
00:10:41,053 --> 00:10:43,253
and expect that shit's gonna land.

161
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,110
I'm not taking anything
to the DA that doesn't have legs.

162
00:10:49,886 --> 00:10:51,984
Why don't you try
both these legs on?

163
00:10:52,865 --> 00:10:54,265
See how they feel.

164
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,122
Teamwork, David.

165
00:10:57,928 --> 00:10:59,778
We all want the same thing.

166
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,720
So I just rub this shit on?

167
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,369
On your wrists.
Two pumps, no more.

168
00:11:08,494 --> 00:11:11,867
And if you notice a big hormonal spike,
it means you've done too much.

169
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:14,842
My whole life is a hormonal spike,
sweetheart.

170
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,420
What is it?

171
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:40,369
Shit!

172
00:12:02,607 --> 00:12:03,679
Oh, shit!

173
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,003
- I'm so sorry!
- Jesus Christ!

174
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:09,048
Sorry.

175
00:12:09,886 --> 00:12:11,645
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

176
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,610
You son of a bitch.

177
00:12:32,362 --> 00:12:33,752
What do you want?

178
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,088
I just got back from Stockton.

179
00:12:36,493 --> 00:12:38,794
Zobelle had Otto jumped.

180
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:41,869
The league's got a reach straight
to the Aryan shot callers.

181
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,932
What does that have
to do with Charming?

182
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:46,555
We don't know
what we're dealing with here.

183
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,180
Zobelle's not Darby.

184
00:12:48,804 --> 00:12:50,560
He ain't some half-bright thug.

185
00:12:51,492 --> 00:12:53,341
- Where you at with him?
- Nowhere.

186
00:12:53,466 --> 00:12:55,050
I gave you the meth lab,

187
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:58,725
- and you gave Darby a pass.
- I didn't give anybody a pass!

188
00:12:59,254 --> 00:13:01,304
Don't you see the pattern here?

189
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:05,117
You're so hell-bent on burning us,
you keep getting in bed with the devil.

190
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,933
It happened with Stahl.
Now it's happening with Zobelle.

191
00:13:09,243 --> 00:13:11,308
It's gonna be the same shit, man.

192
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:13,333
People die, people get hurt.

193
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:17,242
- Like Opie and Donna.
- That was not on me.

194
00:13:22,996 --> 00:13:23,885
Get out.

195
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,039
Shit.

196
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,479
- Would you excuse me?
- Sure.

197
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,505
Hey, daddy.

198
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,711
Hello, sweetheart.

199
00:14:16,261 --> 00:14:17,361
How'd we do?

200
00:14:17,631 --> 00:14:18,781
It's all set.

201
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:20,275
The van's in place.

202
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:22,950
Good.

203
00:14:44,922 --> 00:14:45,922
I'm sorry.

204
00:14:47,246 --> 00:14:50,096
I guess I'm lucky
you didn't blow my head off.

205
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:53,517
You okay?

206
00:14:54,901 --> 00:14:57,346
That running
couldn't have felt good.

207
00:14:57,675 --> 00:14:58,675
I'm fine.

208
00:15:02,323 --> 00:15:03,673
Who was the girl?

209
00:15:09,177 --> 00:15:12,627
Jesus Christ, Gemma,
you have to talk about what happened.

210
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:23,528
I know what it's like to keep
something like this inside.

211
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,031
I doubt that.

212
00:15:28,781 --> 00:15:32,031
You know why I was carrying
that gun a few months ago?

213
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:33,449
The fed.

214
00:15:34,572 --> 00:15:36,172
Got a restraing order.

215
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:40,689
He went after you?

216
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:47,075
Raped you?

217
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,408
It almost went there.
I was able to stop him.

218
00:15:52,637 --> 00:15:53,837
Does Jax know?

219
00:15:54,657 --> 00:15:57,706
I had to tell someone.
I knew it would eat me up if I didn't.

220
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,174
What did Jax do?

221
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:03,753
There was nothing he could do.
Kohn was already gone.

222
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:05,705
My point is,

223
00:16:06,637 --> 00:16:09,949
you need to get this thing out
of your head before you kill someone,

224
00:16:10,074 --> 00:16:11,724
or get yourself killed.

225
00:16:15,305 --> 00:16:17,225
I made an appointment for you.

226
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,717
Dr. Lich. She's a friend.

227
00:16:22,931 --> 00:16:25,281
- She's easy to talk to.
- A shrink?

228
00:16:26,138 --> 00:16:27,888
You're gonna talk to her,

229
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:30,748
or I'm gonna tell Hale
you assaulted me.

230
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,220
Throw your crazy ass in jail.

231
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:47,352
Tables were reversed...

232
00:16:49,616 --> 00:16:51,816
You came to me with what happened.

233
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,310
I'd have cut you off
a long time ago.

234
00:16:58,945 --> 00:17:00,545
It's my way of saying,

235
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,589
what you're doing for me,

236
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:06,429
for the club...

237
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:11,893
Means a lot.

238
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,257
You're welcome.

239
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:23,041
You still have to see the shrink.

240
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:26,126
Main level, room 114.

241
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:28,065
Yes, ma'am.

242
00:17:44,624 --> 00:17:45,683
What do you want?

243
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:47,758
Get down off your high horse.

244
00:17:48,926 --> 00:17:50,943
- That's pretty good there.
- Thanks.

245
00:17:51,068 --> 00:17:52,068
Ricardo.

246
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:54,704
So,

247
00:17:55,663 --> 00:17:58,034
Unser's telling me about
the county looking at your land?

248
00:17:59,088 --> 00:18:00,286
That's my problem.

249
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:04,040
It happens in Charming,
it's Sam Crow's problem.

250
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:08,954
I got a letter
from the county zoning commission.

251
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,643
They're filing for eminent domain.

252
00:18:10,768 --> 00:18:13,107
They want to run a highway
through my timber. 200 acres.

253
00:18:13,232 --> 00:18:14,718
It backs up to the Wahewa land.

254
00:18:14,954 --> 00:18:17,554
I unload it now, or I lose it
to the county for next to nothing.

255
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:19,556
- Bullshit.
- No, it's real.

256
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:23,580
Jacob Hale's putting together
investors for a housing development.

257
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:26,146
If it's residential,
county can't run a highway.

258
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:29,393
I have no choice
but to sell it to him.

259
00:18:29,518 --> 00:18:31,765
Don't be signing off on nothing
till I get back to you.

260
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,319
I want to do some digging.

261
00:18:36,842 --> 00:18:38,992
Why don't you give me the letter.

262
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:47,206
That was Bobby on the phone.
We're all set.

263
00:18:47,331 --> 00:18:50,131
Everyone's going to be
at the table 5:00 p.m.

264
00:18:51,457 --> 00:18:53,465
We move on this Zobelle shit
right away.

265
00:18:55,151 --> 00:18:57,493
That thing with Otto should never
have happened. It's my fault

266
00:18:57,618 --> 00:18:59,706
for not shutting
these assholes down sooner.

267
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:02,784
Thing go like they have,
Jax is gonna go a different way.

268
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:06,079
I ain't gonna let Jax or nobody else
stop us from what we got to do.

269
00:19:06,204 --> 00:19:08,004
Retaliation is what we do.

270
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,132
It's the three of us and Bobby.

271
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:14,089
We still need five for a majority.

272
00:19:14,214 --> 00:19:16,814
Chibs might go with Jax.
My old man, too.

273
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:20,773
You talk to Juice.

274
00:19:22,212 --> 00:19:24,537
You tell him
how important this is to us.

275
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:25,706
All right.

276
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,970
- How's Otto?
- Nearly blind.

277
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:33,017
Jesus.

278
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:36,174
- What's the retaliation?
- I don't know. That's the problem.

279
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:37,777
Not enough intel.

280
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:40,720
We strike back now, we could be playing
right into their hands.

281
00:19:41,832 --> 00:19:43,457
Zobelle's squeaky clean.

282
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,290
Not even a parking ticket.

283
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:47,997
You're going to have to do some
street level recon to find something.

284
00:19:48,122 --> 00:19:51,031
Exactly. We know how deep
Zobelle's tied to the A.B.

285
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:54,081
What we got to figure out
is what he wants with Charming.

286
00:19:54,206 --> 00:19:57,529
We need to make some new alliances...
protect our boys inside.

287
00:19:58,018 --> 00:19:59,269
That's my point, man.

288
00:19:59,394 --> 00:20:02,450
That's why we've got to look past
our short-term need to hurt these guys.

289
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,869
So where does Clay land on this?

290
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:09,648
It ain't about me and Clay.

291
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,293
It's about survival.

292
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:14,167
Everybody's hurting already,
brother.

293
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:16,332
And this shit between you and Clay,

294
00:20:16,457 --> 00:20:18,216
it doesn't happen in a vacuum.

295
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,660
Now, you want my support,

296
00:20:23,581 --> 00:20:25,640
you gotta tell me
what the hell is going on.

297
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,410
I can't tell you.

298
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,447
You old enough to
watch this shit, piney?

299
00:20:42,143 --> 00:20:43,268
Hired him

300
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,717
as security.

301
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:47,712
Make the girls feel safe.

302
00:20:47,837 --> 00:20:50,246
- Dirty old bastard.
- I'm trying.

303
00:20:51,423 --> 00:20:53,501
I need you at the table tonight.

304
00:20:54,017 --> 00:20:56,129
Then I'll be there, won't I?

305
00:20:57,732 --> 00:20:59,173
Think about what I said.

306
00:21:02,821 --> 00:21:04,171
How's Tara doing?

307
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,803
I heard that Gemma clocked her
and broke her nose or something.

308
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:12,937
Jesus Christ.

309
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:21,613
What happened?

310
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:24,217
It was nothing.

311
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:25,995
Just stupid.

312
00:21:26,894 --> 00:21:28,194
My mom did that?

313
00:21:28,744 --> 00:21:32,748
We were on the street. I came up
behind her and must have startled her.

314
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,127
That's a solid shot to the face.

315
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,087
It was an accident.

316
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:41,424
You know this total discloser
thing works both ways.

317
00:21:46,742 --> 00:21:48,192
I have to get back.

318
00:21:52,962 --> 00:21:54,912
Almost finished with the ROS.

319
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,926
If you need to speak with someone,
file a report, you can take...

320
00:22:03,051 --> 00:22:05,114
Why would I want to do that?

321
00:22:06,371 --> 00:22:08,576
I know your guy is part
of the motorcycle gang here.

322
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:09,981
Club.

323
00:22:11,445 --> 00:22:14,100
- It's a motorcycle club.
- Right.

324
00:22:14,225 --> 00:22:17,125
Well, I hope the club
doesn't become a problem.

325
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:19,944
My personal life has nothing
to do with the hospital.

326
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:21,005
I know.

327
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,837
But when that personal life
hits you in the face hard enough,

328
00:22:24,962 --> 00:22:26,469
can't help but impact your work,

329
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:29,697
and then it does
become the hospital's problem.

330
00:22:29,822 --> 00:22:32,072
It's just a heads-up from a friend.

331
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:08,847
Are you Dr. Knowles' friend?

332
00:23:27,235 --> 00:23:29,365
What the hell is it with you
and busting chick's noses?

333
00:23:29,901 --> 00:23:32,368
This one was an accident.
I promise.

334
00:23:33,142 --> 00:23:34,370
What're you doing here?

335
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,446
Same thing you are.

336
00:23:36,811 --> 00:23:38,899
Got mad love for Tara.

337
00:23:39,831 --> 00:23:42,231
Come on,
get me the hell out of here.

338
00:23:45,727 --> 00:23:48,327
You know any of the names
on that letter?

339
00:23:49,497 --> 00:23:52,047
County officials turn
over all the time.

340
00:23:52,921 --> 00:23:55,016
I'll float it around
the city clerk's office.

341
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,051
See if any names jump out.

342
00:23:57,393 --> 00:24:00,093
Make sure you keep
it clear of your deputy.

343
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:03,399
Zobelle could be pulling strings
on both the Hale brothers.

344
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:06,070
Conspiracy theories?

345
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:09,309
Sounding a little paranoid,
aren't you?

346
00:24:09,434 --> 00:24:12,784
- Better to be safe than stupid.
- Speaking of stupid...

347
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:19,624
Come on.

348
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:29,380
- Shit.
- Hang on.

349
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,594
Watch this.

350
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:34,907
Shit. Get off.

351
00:24:41,193 --> 00:24:43,481
- You gentlemen got something...
- The hell you doing?

352
00:24:44,498 --> 00:24:46,535
Street brawl ain't the answer.

353
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,680
Use your head.

354
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,739
Son of a bitch!

355
00:25:07,735 --> 00:25:08,548
Get up!

356
00:25:34,553 --> 00:25:37,705
<i>I realized that in my downward
spiral of hopelessness,</i>

357
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,066
<i>I was actually falling
into the huge hole</i>

358
00:25:40,191 --> 00:25:43,232
<i>created by my absence
of basic human graces.</i>

359
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:45,947
<i>The most obvious was forgiveness.</i>

360
00:25:46,072 --> 00:25:47,569
<i>If I was wronged by anyone,</i>

361
00:25:47,694 --> 00:25:49,126
<i>in or out of the club,</i>

362
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:52,332
<i>I had to be compensated...
money or blood.</i>

363
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:55,218
<i>There was no turning
the other cheek.</i>

364
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:59,000
<i>When relationships become
a ledger of profit and loss,</i>

365
00:25:59,254 --> 00:26:02,069
<i>you have no friends, no loved ones,</i>

366
00:26:02,538 --> 00:26:04,379
<i>just pluses and minuses.</i>

367
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,898
<i>You're absolutely alone.</i>

368
00:26:17,936 --> 00:26:19,836
I need to ask you something.

369
00:26:21,242 --> 00:26:22,330
Need the truth.

370
00:26:25,775 --> 00:26:27,933
Seems to be a suspicion, maybe

371
00:26:28,058 --> 00:26:30,546
you're involved
with Zobelle somehow.

372
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:33,538
This coming from your MC buddies?

373
00:26:33,663 --> 00:26:35,763
Don't matter where it come from.

374
00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:37,345
Is it true?

375
00:26:37,938 --> 00:26:40,416
You're accusing me
of being in someone's pocket,

376
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:42,369
you hypocrite son of a bitch?

377
00:26:42,494 --> 00:26:45,102
You've been on Clay's tit
since you were a goddamn uni.

378
00:26:46,376 --> 00:26:48,433
He barks and you jump.

379
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,626
Whole town knows it.
Chief of police.

380
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:54,643
What a goddamn joke.

381
00:26:55,555 --> 00:26:57,114
Why do you think I chose you

382
00:26:57,693 --> 00:26:58,893
for my second?

383
00:27:00,278 --> 00:27:03,788
A single-minded,
self-righteous pain in the ass.

384
00:27:04,476 --> 00:27:05,976
You're the good guy,

385
00:27:06,655 --> 00:27:08,205
okay?
The clean one.

386
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,820
I need you to stay that way.

387
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:14,109
Otherwise, this whole department's
a goddamn joke.

388
00:27:17,475 --> 00:27:18,475
Sit down!

389
00:27:19,664 --> 00:27:21,564
I'm gonna tell you something

390
00:27:22,573 --> 00:27:24,934
that never leaves this room.

391
00:27:32,571 --> 00:27:34,202
About a month ago,

392
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,308
I found Gemma Teller

393
00:27:37,116 --> 00:27:39,073
in the utility house off 18.

394
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:42,569
Beaten

395
00:27:42,947 --> 00:27:44,036
and raped.

396
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,089
Was Zobelle's aryan crew.

397
00:27:48,818 --> 00:27:50,456
Did it to hurt the mc.

398
00:27:51,877 --> 00:27:53,377
Crush the matriarch.

399
00:27:54,264 --> 00:27:57,264
- Why didn't you...
- Gemma refused to tell them.

400
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,344
To let it twist up the club.

401
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:04,722
We staged the car accident to

402
00:28:04,847 --> 00:28:06,142
cover up her injury.

403
00:28:15,135 --> 00:28:16,402
None of them know?

404
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:21,761
Are you sure it was Zobelle?

405
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,206
No tangible proof.

406
00:28:25,012 --> 00:28:27,512
Couldn't make an arrest
if I wanted to.

407
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:32,960
Made a promise to Gemma
to keep the dirty secret.

408
00:28:34,556 --> 00:28:37,048
Same promise you just made.

409
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,645
I need you to know who Zobelle is.

410
00:28:43,696 --> 00:28:47,623
So you can make your own choice
about what's best for Charming.

411
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:56,174
You know anyone on

412
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:58,278
the Sanwa zoning commission?

413
00:28:58,974 --> 00:29:01,508
County's looking into Oswald's land.

414
00:29:02,623 --> 00:29:05,714
Guess your big brother's
salivating at the idea.

415
00:29:08,617 --> 00:29:09,617
What?

416
00:29:11,992 --> 00:29:14,542
I'm gonna cut them loose
with a warning.

417
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:16,962
Good.

418
00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:19,825
We can't afford to feed them anyway.

419
00:29:42,502 --> 00:29:43,975
This happens again,

420
00:29:44,703 --> 00:29:48,119
you'll do 30 for public disturbance.
Now, get out.

421
00:29:48,499 --> 00:29:49,499
Yes, sir.

422
00:30:03,555 --> 00:30:04,343
Thanks.

423
00:30:06,392 --> 00:30:07,592
Need a minute.

424
00:30:15,098 --> 00:30:16,251
What's this?

425
00:30:22,307 --> 00:30:24,607
You guys running surveillance on us?

426
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:25,806
Not me.

427
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:34,659
Got footage from a security camera.
That's Opie

428
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:36,333
torching the meth lab.

429
00:30:38,764 --> 00:30:40,254
Jesus Christ.

430
00:30:41,032 --> 00:30:42,757
Why you giving us this shit?

431
00:30:43,211 --> 00:30:44,411
I'm not unser.

432
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:46,871
I'm not on anybody's payroll.

433
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,070
Something else you should know.

434
00:30:55,157 --> 00:30:56,576
Few years ago,

435
00:30:56,916 --> 00:31:00,702
this developer, buddy of my brother,
got caught running a scam.

436
00:31:01,775 --> 00:31:03,539
Get a zoning official on the take,

437
00:31:03,664 --> 00:31:06,264
threaten land owners
with eminent domain.

438
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:09,357
Forced them
to sell their property on the cheap.

439
00:31:10,182 --> 00:31:12,120
My old man was
the judge on the case.

440
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,395
He buried it.

441
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,450
Guy walked away.

442
00:31:18,783 --> 00:31:20,621
Jake's buddy's got a new job.

443
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:23,146
On the San Joaquin
zoning commission.

444
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:24,875
There's no highway.

445
00:31:25,087 --> 00:31:26,087
Doubt it.

446
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,540
Appreciate it.

447
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,735
Appreciate
the commercial opportunity...

448
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,690
What're you doing here, Elliot?
We don't have an appointment.

449
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:43,361
We do now.

450
00:31:43,756 --> 00:31:44,985
What's this about?

451
00:31:45,256 --> 00:31:46,898
Sorry, gentlemen.

452
00:31:47,713 --> 00:31:49,320
We're in the middle of something.

453
00:31:49,445 --> 00:31:52,595
- Stealing my land.
- I understand your frustration.

454
00:31:52,757 --> 00:31:55,565
But there's no theft here.
You will be compensated for every acre.

455
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,909
How're folks in Charming gonna react

456
00:31:58,034 --> 00:32:02,038
when they find out one
of their founding sons sold them out?

457
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,816
Running

458
00:32:03,944 --> 00:32:06,921
the same real estate scam
your old man buried

459
00:32:07,668 --> 00:32:08,884
some years back.

460
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,346
You're speculating
in a tainted land deal.

461
00:32:14,943 --> 00:32:17,093
Little brother has a good memory.

462
00:32:23,111 --> 00:32:25,317
We should finish this later, gentlemen.
Excuse me.

463
00:32:37,966 --> 00:32:39,016
Doing okay?

464
00:32:46,036 --> 00:32:47,286
How's the nose?

465
00:32:55,469 --> 00:32:57,769
I've been sitting here watching him.

466
00:33:01,649 --> 00:33:03,480
Trying to figure out
how I fit into all this.

467
00:33:04,408 --> 00:33:05,691
What do you mean?

468
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,327
The violence,

469
00:33:08,716 --> 00:33:09,716
the porn,

470
00:33:10,591 --> 00:33:12,591
the other girls.
Your mother.

471
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:15,973
I try to rationalize, but I...

472
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,487
It's not normal.

473
00:33:23,573 --> 00:33:24,947
What's normal?

474
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:29,590
I can't shake this feeling
that something bad is going to happen.

475
00:33:31,115 --> 00:33:32,115
To him,

476
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,211
to us.

477
00:33:36,505 --> 00:33:39,055
I just don't know
how to live with that.

478
00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:42,686
I'm trying to find
my place here, Jax.

479
00:33:46,445 --> 00:33:47,458
Wait here.

480
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,643
I want to show you something.

481
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:17,691
My dad wrote this.

482
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:19,932
Before he died.

483
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:23,694
It's his vision for the club

484
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,271
and what went wrong
and how to save it.

485
00:34:31,434 --> 00:34:35,434
I'm going to get us out of all
of those things that you're afraid of.

486
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,543
You stay with me, I promise,

487
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,300
you'll find your place.

488
00:35:20,175 --> 00:35:21,775
It's been a shit year.

489
00:35:23,937 --> 00:35:26,487
And I know we were laying low,
trying to

490
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:29,143
shake off this ATF stink.

491
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:33,679
And I would never put
a member of this club at risk,

492
00:35:34,264 --> 00:35:35,264
but...

493
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,811
We underestimated Zobelle.
The league's reach.

494
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,557
Now he hurts a brother.

495
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:45,943
If we don't act now,

496
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,067
it's going to be a sign of weakness.

497
00:35:48,192 --> 00:35:50,939
They'll do it again.
We got an obligation

498
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:52,691
to this club,

499
00:35:53,478 --> 00:35:54,628
to this town,

500
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:56,987
to crush this threat.

501
00:35:57,356 --> 00:35:59,403
Retaliation must be harsh

502
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:01,936
and immediate.

503
00:36:03,403 --> 00:36:04,803
That's what we do.

504
00:36:05,852 --> 00:36:07,752
It's what we've always done.

505
00:36:15,483 --> 00:36:17,933
I agree with everything
you're saying.

506
00:36:18,694 --> 00:36:20,928
We underestimated Zobelle.

507
00:36:21,202 --> 00:36:23,445
Got to protect our club, our town.

508
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:26,076
Retaliation is undisputable.

509
00:36:27,505 --> 00:36:29,005
But if we do it now,

510
00:36:30,332 --> 00:36:32,147
we're doing it half-blind.

511
00:36:32,759 --> 00:36:34,989
These guys aren't gangsters.
They're moneyed,

512
00:36:35,114 --> 00:36:36,777
smart and connected.

513
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:38,506
Both sides of the law.

514
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:41,377
They wanted us to blow up
Darby's meth lab.

515
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,470
That's us doing it,
caught on security cameras.

516
00:36:45,595 --> 00:36:47,295
Op's face, plain as day.

517
00:36:49,217 --> 00:36:52,367
Otto getting jumped was
bait Zobelle knew we'd take.

518
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:56,059
But out here,
he's not using the muscle,

519
00:36:56,184 --> 00:36:57,765
he's using the law.

520
00:36:58,272 --> 00:37:00,550
He expects us to retaliate.

521
00:37:00,675 --> 00:37:01,827
He wants it.

522
00:37:02,364 --> 00:37:04,012
And he's ready for it.

523
00:37:05,185 --> 00:37:06,181
I love otto.

524
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,199
I want to give him his eye.

525
00:37:08,914 --> 00:37:10,686
But not at the expense of my club.

526
00:37:13,703 --> 00:37:14,953
We got to wait.

527
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:17,303
Due diligence.
Learn.

528
00:37:23,966 --> 00:37:25,166
Let's vote it.

529
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,454
Immediate retaliation.

530
00:37:33,815 --> 00:37:34,865
Absolutely.

531
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,593
Don't feel right.

532
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:42,067
So, no.

533
00:38:06,132 --> 00:38:08,282
Four-two.
Where you at, brother?

534
00:38:10,602 --> 00:38:11,691
Smart vote.

535
00:38:21,517 --> 00:38:22,883
Four-four.
No majority.

536
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,712
We wait on retaliation.

537
00:38:54,456 --> 00:38:56,306
When you want blind action,

538
00:38:57,851 --> 00:38:59,143
you go to Tig.

539
00:39:01,259 --> 00:39:02,959
When you want the truth,

540
00:39:03,438 --> 00:39:04,688
you come to me.

541
00:39:07,855 --> 00:39:11,055
I don't know what's going
on between you and the boy.

542
00:39:12,742 --> 00:39:16,746
But somebody has got to start
making decisions that protect this club.

543
00:39:20,327 --> 00:39:21,743
That's what I did.

544
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,094
Thank you.

545
00:39:37,058 --> 00:39:38,858
All right, you're all set.

546
00:39:39,452 --> 00:39:42,315
Next time,
just pull over and call us.

547
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:47,077
Or you can call me.

548
00:39:54,803 --> 00:39:56,353
Fill the hole, Marty.

549
00:40:03,473 --> 00:40:04,985
What's going on?

550
00:40:05,923 --> 00:40:07,309
Tough vote.

551
00:40:09,288 --> 00:40:10,501
Where is he?

552
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:12,283
He's inside.

553
00:40:48,874 --> 00:40:51,174
Maybe you were right about your boy.

554
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:55,319
He's more and more like his old man.

555
00:40:58,652 --> 00:41:01,582
I keep trying to bring him close,
you know?

556
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,780
I keep losing.

557
00:41:08,817 --> 00:41:10,342
I just want him to love me.

558
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,440
He does.

559
00:41:22,848 --> 00:41:24,439
I ain't so sure anymore.

560
00:42:26,288 --> 00:42:27,288
Shit!

561
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:48,687
My God!
