1
00:00:00,915 --> 00:00:02,546
Previously, on Sons of Anarchy

2
00:00:02,707 --> 00:00:05,061
- I thought we agreed to meet alone.
- My son Esai.

3
00:00:05,181 --> 00:00:06,998
I don't travel far from home
without family.

4
00:00:07,118 --> 00:00:09,178
How'd you like to take over
Sam Crow's gun business?

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,389
Their Irish gun supplier.
Part of an ATF file on the Sons.

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,973
You hit Clay first.
Then you kill the rest.

7
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:16,977
I get Charming.
You get the gun intel.

8
00:00:17,138 --> 00:00:19,291
Got to put down two dogs
making my life miserable.

9
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:21,775
- Just tell me who.
- Sam Crow boss.

10
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:25,527
And that greedy cracker shithead.
Let me and my boys do it.

11
00:00:25,955 --> 00:00:27,029
Michael McKeavy.

12
00:00:27,684 --> 00:00:30,069
- Good soldier, good friend.
- Hear.

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,582
He's hurt real bad.
We got to get him back to the clubhouse.

14
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,749
That ATF agent, I was with him.

15
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:40,168
It got violent. I tried to end it.
He started stalking me.

16
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:42,921
Not this way.

17
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,458
You stupid bitch!

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,402
They're gonna patch him up.
He'll do a few years for assault.

19
00:00:50,522 --> 00:00:52,889
Then he's gonna be out.
Free to do this again.

20
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:54,557
Once a biker slut, always a...

21
00:02:21,218 --> 00:02:22,145
Where is he?

22
00:02:23,023 --> 00:02:24,023
Relax.

23
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:25,926
Don't tell me to relax.

24
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,955
Called his cell phone a dozen times,

25
00:02:28,305 --> 00:02:29,996
Tara's house. No answer.

26
00:02:30,947 --> 00:02:32,577
I can't just sit here.

27
00:02:35,902 --> 00:02:39,162
Till we see where this lands,
you stay put, understand?

28
00:02:39,338 --> 00:02:42,328
- What if they got to him?
- Jax can take care of himself, Gem.

29
00:02:43,952 --> 00:02:45,794
I'm going to the hospital,
see if he's there.

30
00:02:45,964 --> 00:02:47,212
I'll go with you.

31
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:51,549
Take care of my boys.

32
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,690
Always.

33
00:02:55,522 --> 00:02:57,628
We got to get the slugs out
of this guy's ass.

34
00:02:57,748 --> 00:03:00,406
Infection's spreading.
He may even have sepsis.

35
00:03:00,526 --> 00:03:02,435
Just do the best you can, all right?

36
00:03:22,634 --> 00:03:24,374
I can't find the damn slug!

37
00:03:31,342 --> 00:03:32,632
Unser at the back door.

38
00:03:36,712 --> 00:03:37,712
Let him in.

39
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:39,440
Shut those doors.

40
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,046
- Me arse!
- Keep him quiet.

41
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:51,724
What can I do for you, Chief?

42
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:54,917
I need to bring you down
to the station house,

43
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:56,849
ask a few questions.

44
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,540
Why? What happened?

45
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:01,799
Someone went after Darby last night,

46
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,240
killed one of his guys, two women.

47
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:05,861
At his house.

48
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:07,250
In Charming.

49
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:11,193
You think it was us?

50
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:15,133
Lodi also found two dead Mayans
in a ditch off 18,

51
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,277
half mile outside of town.

52
00:04:17,398 --> 00:04:19,233
Last time
I looked at the scoreboard,

53
00:04:19,465 --> 00:04:21,713
Nords and Mayans were the away team.

54
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,738
Glad you're rooting
for the home team, Chief.

55
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:26,477
I see you for a minute?

56
00:04:32,136 --> 00:04:33,413
It's okay. Don't worry.

57
00:04:33,644 --> 00:04:35,191
This ain't funny.

58
00:04:35,397 --> 00:04:36,375
At all.

59
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:38,434
Five DBs.

60
00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:40,997
Know what heat that brings?

61
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:49,218
Jesus Christ.

62
00:04:52,582 --> 00:04:54,874
- Who the hell is that?
- A friend.

63
00:04:57,148 --> 00:04:59,802
With two bullets in his ass
that were meant for my head.

64
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:04,224
The Mayans went after me, too.

65
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:06,071
Goddamn it.

66
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:08,400
We didn't have nothing
to do with Darby.

67
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,439
And the dead Mexicans were
the result of their own stupidity.

68
00:05:11,682 --> 00:05:14,156
But I made sure that didn't land
in Charming.

69
00:05:14,276 --> 00:05:15,276
Barely.

70
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:19,376
My office still got
the stink of ATF.

71
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:23,463
This body count's gonna bring
that haughty bitch circling back.

72
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:28,051
I need you to come with me.

73
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,458
All right? Due process.

74
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:34,514
I got nothing to hide.

75
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:36,965
You do not go alone.

76
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,899
- I think I could keep him safe.
- I'll be all right.

77
00:05:42,215 --> 00:05:43,965
You hold it together here.

78
00:05:45,452 --> 00:05:47,624
- I'll meet you down there.
- No.

79
00:05:49,273 --> 00:05:50,423
You stay put.

80
00:05:58,146 --> 00:05:59,434
I'll watch her.

81
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:03,825
I got it! I got it!

82
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,620
- Jesus!
- Shit! Shit! Shit!

83
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,872
Come here! Hold that!

84
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:11,985
- What the...?
- Hold on.

85
00:06:13,412 --> 00:06:14,752
We got one slug out.

86
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:16,237
This is insane.

87
00:06:17,124 --> 00:06:20,091
- What the hell are we gonna do?
- Just keep your finger in his ass.

88
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,802
This is way beyond my wheelhouse.
This is way beyond it!

89
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:25,660
Just stay.

90
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:29,468
- Where you going?
- Find Jax and Tara.

91
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:31,654
You heard what Clay said:
family stays put.

92
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:34,477
You got two choices, Tigger:
tackle me or tag along.

93
00:06:34,597 --> 00:06:36,131
I got nothing but adoration for you.

94
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:38,149
Why do you got to give me
such a hard time for?

95
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:40,146
It's my nature. I'm a giver.

96
00:06:42,564 --> 00:06:44,499
This is why I beat hookers.

97
00:06:57,278 --> 00:06:58,487
Jesus Christ.

98
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:01,162
You scared the shit out of me.

99
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,089
Where you been?

100
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:06,309
I'm sorry. I got caught up.

101
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:11,091
You been here?

102
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,477
This whole time?

103
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:15,471
We been waiting
for those medical supplies, man.

104
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:16,591
I know.

105
00:07:17,357 --> 00:07:18,884
That's it? You know?

106
00:07:19,568 --> 00:07:20,942
Someone tries to kill Clay,

107
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:22,862
and you decide
it's a good time to get laid?

108
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:24,572
It's not like that, Mom.

109
00:07:25,673 --> 00:07:28,530
If you want to resurrect old trauma
with this bitch,

110
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,900
you do it on your own goddamn time.

111
00:07:35,592 --> 00:07:36,907
She's not there.

112
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:38,795
Don't go looking for her either.

113
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:40,149
Mom!

114
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:42,399
Leave her alone.

115
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,059
Don't ever forget
your first priority.

116
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,460
I didn't.

117
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:03,747
Take your foot

118
00:08:04,252 --> 00:08:05,485
off my bike.

119
00:08:57,241 --> 00:09:00,850
Episode 109: Hell Followed

120
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:08,917
It wasn't Sam Crow.

121
00:09:09,037 --> 00:09:11,538
- It was Mayan filth killed my guy.
- We have your statement.

122
00:09:11,658 --> 00:09:13,181
We'll look into your accusations.

123
00:09:14,451 --> 00:09:15,516
Accusation?

124
00:09:16,636 --> 00:09:18,352
You arrogant piece of shit!

125
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:24,153
Get this asshole off me!

126
00:09:30,392 --> 00:09:31,229
You okay?

127
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:34,149
The shithead caught me off guard.

128
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:39,964
- Put him in holding.
- That's right. Arrest the white guy,

129
00:09:40,084 --> 00:09:43,640
let the wetbacks and coons shoot up
whoever they want to shoot up.

130
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,746
You do know that I'm married
to a dark-skinned woman, right?

131
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:50,471
Yeah, I know that.

132
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:55,765
Just making sure.

133
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:06,039
How you feeling?

134
00:10:06,587 --> 00:10:07,902
What the hell's going on?

135
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:10,908
There were some...

136
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:13,074
complications.

137
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:16,202
- Where's the Scotsman at?
- He's gonna be right back.

138
00:10:17,286 --> 00:10:18,579
Where the hell's your hand?

139
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:20,623
It's...

140
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,429
Okay.

141
00:10:24,037 --> 00:10:24,973
Well...

142
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:27,843
my finger is...

143
00:10:28,988 --> 00:10:31,050
plugging up
one of your bullet holes.

144
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,191
You got your finger
jammed up my ass?

145
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:40,510
Well, technically, yes. Okay.

146
00:10:40,914 --> 00:10:43,046
But my finger's not
jammed up your ass,

147
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,794
'cause, you know, that would be gay.

148
00:10:44,914 --> 00:10:46,964
It's kind of jammed in your ass.

149
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,793
Which I guess is still kind of gay.

150
00:10:49,913 --> 00:10:51,067
- Jesus...
- But I...

151
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:52,780
Am I gonna die or not?

152
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:55,410
I don't think so.

153
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:57,958
Scotsman.

154
00:10:58,474 --> 00:11:00,624
I need you guys to do me a favor.

155
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:02,565
Brenan Hefner.

156
00:11:03,123 --> 00:11:04,392
Port commissioner.

157
00:11:04,537 --> 00:11:05,918
He's got to be dealt with.

158
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:07,794
- There's plenty of time for that.
- No!

159
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,190
It's got to happen before Monday.

160
00:11:10,724 --> 00:11:13,274
He's gonna sic port dogs
on our shipment.

161
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,043
You got to take him out.

162
00:11:15,163 --> 00:11:16,262
You promise me that.

163
00:11:16,848 --> 00:11:17,792
Don't worry.

164
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:20,262
Promise you.
It'll get done, I swear.

165
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:22,947
Have a drown. There you go.

166
00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:25,315
Take him out?

167
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,381
That means, like, kill him?

168
00:11:30,461 --> 00:11:33,467
No, I think what he means
is dinner and a movie.

169
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:41,245
Jackie boy, where have you been?!

170
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:43,187
I'm here now.

171
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:46,036
The bullet in this guy's ass

172
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:48,090
has hit a major femoral artery.

173
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,476
He needs a doctor
and he needs it now.

174
00:11:50,596 --> 00:11:51,580
All right.

175
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:54,610
Where's Clay?

176
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,229
Unser took him in for questioning.

177
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,596
The Mayans tried to hit Darby, too.

178
00:12:00,088 --> 00:12:01,121
Holy shit.

179
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:03,794
The other charters are on their way,
all right?

180
00:12:03,914 --> 00:12:06,316
Clay wants to bounce out
this Mayan problem with them

181
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:09,921
- before we decide on any retaliation.
- Okay, makes sense.

182
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,151
Let me know if anything breaks.

183
00:12:14,146 --> 00:12:15,709
Where are you going?

184
00:12:16,156 --> 00:12:17,558
To find a doctor.

185
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:21,010
Don't ride alone.

186
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,076
I'll go with him.

187
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:29,739
- I've been calling you.
- Shit.

188
00:12:35,105 --> 00:12:36,550
What the hell is going on, Ope?

189
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,667
Something came up. Clay needed me.

190
00:12:38,787 --> 00:12:39,921
The mill called.

191
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,909
if you're not there
to pick up the 2nd shift,

192
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:43,766
- your ass is canned.
- I'll deal with it.

193
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:45,250
Deal with it? How?

194
00:12:46,035 --> 00:12:47,937
You're not there,
you're out of work.

195
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:53,776
We got something goin' here, Donna.

196
00:12:55,345 --> 00:12:56,946
You lying piece of shit.

197
00:12:57,764 --> 00:12:59,729
Your promises were just smoke,
weren't they?

198
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:02,339
No, I never lied to you.
I said I'd find a way to earn straight.

199
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,027
They're gonna fire you.

200
00:13:04,147 --> 00:13:06,105
The club is more important
than taking care of us?

201
00:13:06,225 --> 00:13:08,667
It's more important
than spitting sawdust ten hours a day.

202
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,262
I'll figure it out.

203
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,215
I'm not gonna live this way anymore.

204
00:13:19,036 --> 00:13:20,686
I'm done with this shit.

205
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:31,688
Look, I'm fine.

206
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:35,106
- You should go after her.
- I can't keep doing this.

207
00:13:35,226 --> 00:13:37,149
Half our goddamned fights
are about money,

208
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:39,723
and I can't get ahead
without the club.

209
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:41,825
I need back in.

210
00:13:43,286 --> 00:13:45,202
Guns, protections runs, all of it.

211
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:48,567
- You still gotta talk to Donna.
- I'm done talking.

212
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,241
I want back in, Jax.

213
00:13:53,845 --> 00:13:56,065
I'll talk to Clay when I see him.

214
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:01,351
I didn't see this coming.

215
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,030
Us and the Mexicans...

216
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:06,215
it's been kinda quiet.

217
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:09,268
I'm not an idiot.

218
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,513
I know it was the Mayans
torched your warehouse last month.

219
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:14,523
Yeah, but coming after me,
and Heir Darby?

220
00:14:17,164 --> 00:14:18,903
That's a new kind of boldness.

221
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:23,415
Me and you,
whatever the hell this is now,

222
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:27,078
always had one thing
we played out together.

223
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:31,481
Keeping blood and greed away
from our front door.

224
00:14:32,174 --> 00:14:33,353
We've done that.

225
00:14:33,478 --> 00:14:34,475
Until now.

226
00:14:36,228 --> 00:14:37,478
And my fear is,

227
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:40,341
knowing the amount of pride
stuffed into that cut,

228
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,215
it will not end here.

229
00:14:42,352 --> 00:14:44,847
Don't get involved in my end game,
okay, old friend?

230
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,081
I'm not an old friend, remember?

231
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,018
I'm an old cop.

232
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:53,542
And this old cop is telling ya
the tit for tat can't go on.

233
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:55,419
Fine.

234
00:14:59,136 --> 00:15:01,003
We done tittin' and tattin'?

235
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:08,160
You take out that Mayan boss,

236
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,217
and you will trip a wire

237
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:13,505
that sends this town
into the history books.

238
00:15:14,397 --> 00:15:18,170
The bad guys will leave the ghetto
and bring their filthy game to Charming.

239
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:22,168
And next time it won't be a few
of Darby's scumbags who go down.

240
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,844
It'll be one of your guys

241
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,583
or Floyd or some kid or something.

242
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:28,973
See where I'm going with this?

243
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:31,111
Deal always was

244
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:34,844
outlaws live in Charming,
shit beyond the borders.

245
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:38,983
You can't change the rules
or it all goes to hell.

246
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:45,376
And that, my old friend,

247
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:49,400
is exactly what Captain America
out there wants:

248
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,422
hell to break out in Charming,

249
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:54,792
followed by all the things
that put the devil in place.

250
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:08,743
It's for my cancer.

251
00:16:09,978 --> 00:16:11,128
I got a card.

252
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,148
What the hell's this?

253
00:16:24,675 --> 00:16:26,405
A little family reunion.

254
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:28,233
Holy shit.

255
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,853
- Did you hear anything that I just...?
- Enough, enough, all right?!

256
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:34,663
You goddamn angst
is giving me cancer.

257
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,373
I heard your plea

258
00:16:37,093 --> 00:16:38,292
loud and clear.

259
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,441
There's only one thing
that's gonna make this work.

260
00:16:56,917 --> 00:17:00,201
Have the sheriff pick up
Marcus Alvarez and bring him here.

261
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,728
Oh, sure!

262
00:17:01,918 --> 00:17:04,068
Should I dress him in a lamb suit?

263
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:05,784
Listen to me.

264
00:17:05,904 --> 00:17:08,241
Bring in Alvarez, I talk to him.

265
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:10,074
I'll talk to Darby.

266
00:17:10,514 --> 00:17:11,923
We figure it out.

267
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,229
An hour from now,
there's gonna be a dozen guys

268
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:22,303
sitting around a redwood table
planning a kill.

269
00:17:22,423 --> 00:17:23,420
If I were you,

270
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,351
I would take my request

271
00:17:25,471 --> 00:17:28,512
and put it at the top
of that old cop to-do list.

272
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:40,408
How's he doing?

273
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,482
Good.
It's a strong-willed little guy.

274
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:47,755
Thought you were gonna take
a personal day?

275
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:50,287
I tried to. I had to get out of there,
you know?

276
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:51,802
It's a light day.

277
00:17:53,093 --> 00:17:54,115
You okay?

278
00:17:56,498 --> 00:17:57,720
I don't know.

279
00:18:11,518 --> 00:18:12,678
What'd you do with him?

280
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:17,605
It's done.

281
00:18:26,604 --> 00:18:27,854
What did we do?

282
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:37,488
When Kohn showed up at Charming,

283
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:40,485
he knew this could only end
one of two ways...

284
00:18:41,228 --> 00:18:43,078
Either him dead or you dead.

285
00:18:44,777 --> 00:18:46,432
It ended the right way.

286
00:18:48,734 --> 00:18:51,643
Maybe I came back here
knowing the same thing.

287
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:56,092
And this was the only place
I felt safe.

288
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,639
It was survival.

289
00:19:00,402 --> 00:19:02,331
You did what you had to do.

290
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:07,110
Is that how this works?
You make up...

291
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,480
your own moral code for everything?

292
00:19:13,071 --> 00:19:15,877
I never killed anyone
like this before, Tara.

293
00:19:17,546 --> 00:19:19,496
I don't know what the code is.

294
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,548
I'm sorry.

295
00:19:22,382 --> 00:19:25,266
I've been waking up
every day since he was born

296
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:27,445
with this sick feeling,

297
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:30,765
wondering who was gonna die today.

298
00:19:32,057 --> 00:19:34,088
It scares the shit out of me.

299
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:39,108
And then, I woke up this morning,
and it was gone.

300
00:19:43,534 --> 00:19:45,437
I think that scares me more.

301
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:47,773
You're in shock.

302
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:50,772
I don't think anything
can shock me anymore.

303
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:55,434
What do you want me to do?
How can I help you?

304
00:19:58,121 --> 00:19:59,565
Don't go anywhere.

305
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:05,319
I'm not.

306
00:20:16,072 --> 00:20:18,567
I need you to come
to the clubhouse with me.

307
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,187
Those medical supplies I needed?

308
00:20:22,225 --> 00:20:23,294
Bullet wounds.

309
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,270
The guy's got a bad infection.
We're gonna lose him.

310
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:32,646
I'll borrow some things.

311
00:20:34,582 --> 00:20:36,285
What happened
with you and the Mayans?

312
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,527
I know you and Alvarez made
a deal in Chino. What went south?

313
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,849
That spic name don't ring a bell.

314
00:20:53,536 --> 00:20:54,874
Ring a bell now?

315
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,892
We can keep going
cage fight if you want.

316
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:12,599
How many punches
you got left in that hand?

317
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,260
Okay,

318
00:21:21,043 --> 00:21:22,534
Stupid question.

319
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,674
I gave up the 20
on your gun warehouse.

320
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:39,804
The Mayans were supposed to provide

321
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,446
muscle for my crank push
into Charming.

322
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:47,142
Alvarez double-crossed you.

323
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:50,707
I'm gonna slit
that wetback's throat ear to ear.

324
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:51,831
No, you're not.

325
00:21:52,956 --> 00:21:55,875
- Neither am I.
- What the hell you talking about?

326
00:21:56,868 --> 00:21:59,554
The murder rate tripled
in my town last night.

327
00:21:59,674 --> 00:22:02,995
If we kill King Beaner,
Charming becomes a war zone.

328
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:06,286
- So, what, we sit back and do nothing?
- No, we do something.

329
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:09,107
And it will be satisfying.

330
00:22:11,689 --> 00:22:14,378
But Sam Crow handles
the retaliation.

331
00:22:14,878 --> 00:22:15,911
You got it?

332
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,470
My God.

333
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,195
Took two slugs.
I got one.

334
00:22:30,342 --> 00:22:33,855
Little Dutch boy's keeping
the blood dike from bursting.

335
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,379
Have some Vancomycin.
This'll kill anything.

336
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:39,670
Give him two now
and then one every four hours.

337
00:22:43,804 --> 00:22:44,870
Got to wake up.

338
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,998
Wake up here.
Come on. Wake up.

339
00:22:47,277 --> 00:22:49,545
- What's going on?
- Take these.

340
00:22:49,963 --> 00:22:51,206
Doc's here.

341
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:53,497
She's going to fix you up.
Here you go.

342
00:22:56,424 --> 00:22:57,813
How's it look?

343
00:22:58,973 --> 00:23:00,716
It looks like you got shot.

344
00:23:01,152 --> 00:23:03,331
The doctor is a friend of the club.

345
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,267
You're in good hands.

346
00:23:13,233 --> 00:23:15,826
- You Irish, Doc?
- Half.

347
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,290
The half that's a doctor?

348
00:23:20,122 --> 00:23:21,270
I'm not sure.

349
00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:24,156
You should find that out.
It's good to know.

350
00:23:27,772 --> 00:23:28,772
Me?

351
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:35,593
Where should I put it?

352
00:23:37,357 --> 00:23:38,542
Careful.

353
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:40,224
I'm going to have...

354
00:23:40,475 --> 00:23:42,712
- Juice.
- ... Juice. Pull his finger out.

355
00:23:42,832 --> 00:23:44,894
I want you to stuff
that gauze into the wound,

356
00:23:45,014 --> 00:23:47,366
and then I'll close it off
with this clamp, okay? ***

357
00:23:47,486 --> 00:23:49,222
Sure you know what you're doing?

358
00:23:50,024 --> 00:23:51,308
Guess we'll find out.

359
00:23:52,781 --> 00:23:54,352
Ready?
One...

360
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:56,147
two...

361
00:23:56,364 --> 00:23:57,168
three.

362
00:24:02,467 --> 00:24:05,106
Holy shit.
Great job, Doc.

363
00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:08,491
Can I go and wash my hands now?

364
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Yeah.

365
00:24:12,187 --> 00:24:14,784
Hey, you did...
you did great, Juice.

366
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:17,691
You helped...
you helped save his life.

367
00:24:26,822 --> 00:24:28,420
That was very sweet.

368
00:24:30,074 --> 00:24:33,139
No, I mean it.
That guy's not used to good feedback.

369
00:24:33,636 --> 00:24:36,058
I'm a little out of my element here.

370
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,810
I'm not quite sure
how all this works.

371
00:24:39,626 --> 00:24:41,967
For now, you keep him alive.

372
00:24:42,641 --> 00:24:43,806
Beyond that...

373
00:24:45,889 --> 00:24:48,139
I got no idea how this works.

374
00:24:57,535 --> 00:24:58,732
What the hell is this?

375
00:24:58,852 --> 00:25:01,920
The sheriff said I was being
brought in for questioning.

376
00:25:10,617 --> 00:25:12,260
I'm sitting here...

377
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,210
trying to think

378
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,812
how killing me and the dirty white boy
is a smart move for you guys.

379
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,023
There's got to be a piece
of the puzzle I ain't seeing.

380
00:25:22,393 --> 00:25:24,588
Or maybe you're just really stupid.

381
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:26,292
Which...

382
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:29,077
looking at how
you botched both hits,

383
00:25:29,655 --> 00:25:31,366
as a theory, ain't too far-fetched.

384
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,315
You got something you want to do here,
let's get to it, man.

385
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:36,596
What do you mean, like shiv ya?

386
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,744
Make you suck my dick?

387
00:25:40,148 --> 00:25:41,952
That's a little obvious,
don't you think?

388
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:45,905
You and me, Marky,

389
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:49,594
we're going to have
our own little MC summit.

390
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:50,999
 Yeah?

391
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:53,440
We're just going
to figure it all out, are we?

392
00:25:53,704 --> 00:25:56,212
I don't know, man.
Mayans and Sons...

393
00:25:56,332 --> 00:25:59,603
- that's some real Arab-Jew shit.
- We got a little history,

394
00:25:59,763 --> 00:26:02,026
but why don't we talk
about the present.

395
00:26:07,913 --> 00:26:10,001
You guys need guns, right?

396
00:26:10,376 --> 00:26:12,221
Half-ass gats
you're buying off the street

397
00:26:12,341 --> 00:26:14,117
barely scare the clerks
at the 7-Eleven...

398
00:26:14,277 --> 00:26:17,825
- We arm up just fine, ese.
- Bullshit. You're packing toys.

399
00:26:18,129 --> 00:26:20,885
You need real guns;
I need real money.

400
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,260
Maybe it's time for me to...

401
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:28,156
expand my customer base.

402
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:33,579
Sounds smart.

403
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,914
What I really need...

404
00:26:40,947 --> 00:26:42,932
is that nigger's heroin trade.

405
00:26:43,231 --> 00:26:45,213
Can't take it
if their guns are bigger than mine.

406
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:49,200
I said expand, not exchange.
I'm still going to sell to the Niners.

407
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,883
You guys want to play Operation
Ghetto Storm, knock yourselves out.

408
00:26:53,331 --> 00:26:56,625
What I'm offering you is the same
hardware at the same price.

409
00:26:58,211 --> 00:26:59,377
What's your end?

410
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,956
Peace of mind.

411
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:08,536
Charters up north, they settle
all their beefs with the SOA,

412
00:27:08,656 --> 00:27:10,588
and I don't care what it costs you.

413
00:27:11,203 --> 00:27:13,009
It all ends up in our favor.

414
00:27:14,498 --> 00:27:15,592
And Nevada...

415
00:27:16,377 --> 00:27:19,099
your charters leave my new crew
in Indian Hills alone.

416
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,250
And the first bullet

417
00:27:21,786 --> 00:27:24,969
out of one of my guns
that hits a Son or friend of,

418
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:28,358
ends the arrangement, followed by a hell
you don't even want to know.

419
00:27:30,027 --> 00:27:31,456
What about ATF?

420
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,102
Non-issue.

421
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:38,108
They know about
your Irish gun hook-up, ese.

422
00:27:38,378 --> 00:27:40,704
Ship from Dungloe, oil drums.

423
00:27:40,864 --> 00:27:42,416
Got intel on all of it.

424
00:27:44,194 --> 00:27:46,049
And that puzzle piece
you couldn't see...

425
00:27:46,328 --> 00:27:49,174
some ATF agent you guys
pissed off sent Darby a file.

426
00:27:50,155 --> 00:27:52,491
Gave him all the info
on your gun business.

427
00:27:57,641 --> 00:28:00,808
Let me guess.
Darby used it as currency?

428
00:28:01,105 --> 00:28:02,767
The guns for my head?

429
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:05,921
I hate that white boy.

430
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:08,905
Let my emotions
get the better of me.

431
00:28:09,025 --> 00:28:11,949
The hits... bad planning,
sloppy work.

432
00:28:13,398 --> 00:28:17,310
I guess God had a bigger plan.
I mean, here we are talking about peace.

433
00:28:17,564 --> 00:28:18,908
Ain't no peace yet.

434
00:28:19,753 --> 00:28:21,749
Don't forget, you tried to end me.

435
00:28:22,185 --> 00:28:23,580
That doesn't go unanswered.

436
00:28:24,281 --> 00:28:25,707
Salt Lake to Tacoma...

437
00:28:26,024 --> 00:28:28,626
my crews going
to want your head on a stick.

438
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,381
I got a compromise

439
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,493
I think will satisfy everyone.

440
00:28:45,894 --> 00:28:47,411
I never made a conscious decision

441
00:28:47,531 --> 00:28:49,758
to have the club
become one thing or another.

442
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:52,161
It just happened before my eyes.

443
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:55,662
Each savage event
was a catalyst for the next.

444
00:28:55,865 --> 00:28:58,323
And by the time the violence
reached epic proportion,

445
00:28:58,787 --> 00:29:00,023
I couldn't see it.

446
00:29:00,459 --> 00:29:02,009
Blood was every color.

447
00:29:13,431 --> 00:29:15,634
- Doc's looking for you.
- Okay.

448
00:29:19,796 --> 00:29:21,805
One two three...

449
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,811
Takin' easy, we ***got***

450
00:29:31,964 --> 00:29:33,024
How is he?

451
00:29:33,925 --> 00:29:36,367
I got the slugs out
and stopped the bleeding.

452
00:29:36,884 --> 00:29:39,489
If the penicillin kills the infection,
he should make it.

453
00:29:40,588 --> 00:29:41,616
How is she?

454
00:29:43,743 --> 00:29:45,519
Can't stop that bleeding.

455
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:49,707
She still wants me dead,
you know that, right?

456
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,162
I'll handle my mother.

457
00:30:01,691 --> 00:30:03,750
What happened last night...

458
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:06,724
can never happen again.

459
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:11,020
Not just someone trying to off me,

460
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:14,806
but bodies dropping in Charming
'cause of us.

461
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,775
We had nothing to do
with the hit on the Nords.

462
00:30:17,895 --> 00:30:19,946
Mayans went
after me and Darby, all right?

463
00:30:20,106 --> 00:30:22,356
Different targets, same war.

464
00:30:22,792 --> 00:30:24,170
We fire back...

465
00:30:26,745 --> 00:30:29,038
we can't stop the blowback
from hitting home.

466
00:30:32,645 --> 00:30:34,544
- I sat down with Alvarez.
- What?

467
00:30:38,877 --> 00:30:40,492
What, just the two of you?

468
00:30:40,857 --> 00:30:42,854
- Where?
- Unser's cage.

469
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:44,999
We...

470
00:30:46,215 --> 00:30:48,391
we discussed
our outstanding issues...

471
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:51,833
made a deal.

472
00:30:52,157 --> 00:30:53,505
What kind of deal?

473
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:54,856
We sell them guns,

474
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,591
they settle all their beefs
with all of us.

475
00:30:58,311 --> 00:31:01,070
Any territory hassles,
any business disputes,

476
00:31:01,514 --> 00:31:04,407
- it all lands in our favor.
- You made that call

477
00:31:05,261 --> 00:31:06,548
without a vote?

478
00:31:06,954 --> 00:31:08,077
I set it up.

479
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:11,122
We vote on it now.

480
00:31:12,262 --> 00:31:13,458
If this thing passes,

481
00:31:15,151 --> 00:31:17,837
you all sit down with the Mayans
in your own territories,

482
00:31:18,562 --> 00:31:19,818
you work stuff out.

483
00:31:20,923 --> 00:31:23,335
- Take the win.
- What about Laroy and the Niners?

484
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:25,393
We've had a deal
with them for years.

485
00:31:25,513 --> 00:31:27,096
That we don't sell to the wetbacks.

486
00:31:27,256 --> 00:31:29,182
Juice, Laroy don't have
no loyalty to us.

487
00:31:29,499 --> 00:31:32,691
He's been buying from other dealers.
He reneged on the AK sale.

488
00:31:32,811 --> 00:31:34,729
Ain't no reason at all
we can't branch out.

489
00:31:35,037 --> 00:31:36,892
But the peace
we make with the Mayans

490
00:31:37,012 --> 00:31:39,234
could start something
a lot worse with the Niners.

491
00:31:39,734 --> 00:31:41,944
We'll deal with that fire
when it catches.

492
00:31:42,064 --> 00:31:44,447
You know,
these assholes tried to kill you, man.

493
00:31:44,964 --> 00:31:46,924
We're supposed to just pretend
that didn't happen?

494
00:31:49,087 --> 00:31:50,870
That debt gets settled.

495
00:31:52,046 --> 00:31:53,454
But not by us.

496
00:31:56,084 --> 00:31:58,334
It's got to be some outside charter.

497
00:31:59,966 --> 00:32:01,047
You up for it, Hap?

498
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,861
I'll do this thing.

499
00:32:03,981 --> 00:32:05,290
It'll be perfect.

500
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,178
Of that I have no doubt.

501
00:32:08,696 --> 00:32:10,997
Everybody in favor
of the Mayan deal...

502
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:22,810
Anybody opposed?

503
00:32:39,048 --> 00:32:42,964
Cameron was supposed to kill
that piece of shit Hefner before Monday.

504
00:32:43,124 --> 00:32:45,351
Hefner's squeezing the Irish
for more payoff cash.

505
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:48,385
- So he's gonna intercept the cargo.
- How is that our problem?

506
00:32:48,505 --> 00:32:50,209
It ain't a problem.

507
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:52,361
It's a gift from the Irishman.

508
00:32:53,456 --> 00:32:55,343
Look, we take out
the port commissioner...

509
00:32:55,463 --> 00:32:58,210
he's going to give us back
the 200K that we just forked over.

510
00:32:58,832 --> 00:33:00,618
Plus a month of free guns.

511
00:33:00,738 --> 00:33:03,074
Our warehouse rebuild
is crushing us.

512
00:33:03,603 --> 00:33:05,139
It's the cost of raw materials.

513
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:06,912
Free guns and cash...

514
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:09,679
we could be seeing black
before we put a roof on it.

515
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:11,026
Murder for hire?

516
00:33:11,979 --> 00:33:14,579
- That's a dirty business.
- It's not about money.

517
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:16,453
That asshole killed McKeavy.

518
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:20,704
Michael was a friend of mine
and yours and your dad's.

519
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:23,546
And he went back
a long way with Sam Crow.

520
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,091
What do you think, V.P.?

521
00:33:28,003 --> 00:33:29,442
I agree with Piney.

522
00:33:30,131 --> 00:33:33,264
McKeavy was a friend.
I think we owe it to the Irish.

523
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:41,935
How was Cameron gonna do it?

524
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,549
Hefner's got a Sunday ritual.

525
00:33:44,669 --> 00:33:47,598
Church with the fat wife,
sex with the black girlfriend.

526
00:33:48,231 --> 00:33:51,191
She lives in a shitty hood,
right outside his nice Oakland suburb.

527
00:33:51,311 --> 00:33:52,784
And that's where we take him out.

528
00:33:53,735 --> 00:33:56,663
Black-on-white hate crime?
Who gives a shit?

529
00:33:57,915 --> 00:33:59,471
- Who does it?
- I do.

530
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,670
Been a while
since you suited up, brother.

531
00:34:06,777 --> 00:34:07,632
I'll do it.

532
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,333
I can do this.

533
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,024
Get Cameron to confirm the payoff.

534
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,399
No mistakes.

535
00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:26,275
Allright.

536
00:34:38,725 --> 00:34:41,282
I want Ope pulling the trigger
on this.

537
00:34:41,402 --> 00:34:43,587
I want to make sure
he's really back.

538
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:45,678
We all do.

539
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,474
That's a good look for you.

540
00:35:00,611 --> 00:35:01,814
You think?

541
00:35:32,135 --> 00:35:33,418
Are we crazy?

542
00:35:35,825 --> 00:35:37,440
I'll answer that later.

543
00:36:00,029 --> 00:36:03,267
- You look like shit, man.
- Donna took the kids to her mom's.

544
00:36:03,387 --> 00:36:05,458
I can never sleep
when the house is empty.

545
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:16,755
This gig doesn't make
sense for you, Ope.

546
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,644
Why do you keep
trying to push me off this?

547
00:36:18,764 --> 00:36:21,335
You're the one who keeps saying
I can't live half in and half out.

548
00:36:21,455 --> 00:36:23,368
'Cause you need it too much.

549
00:36:23,488 --> 00:36:25,520
It becomes about money
and shit gets sloppy.

550
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,218
This is not about money.

551
00:36:30,317 --> 00:36:32,752
I'm doing this
the same reason you are.

552
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:35,446
To prove I'm Sam Crow.

553
00:36:36,473 --> 00:36:39,434
- I got nothing to prove.
- That's not what I hear.

554
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:50,872
Look, I'm ready for this, brother.

555
00:36:51,855 --> 00:36:53,214
Let's just get it done.

556
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,593
Fine.

557
00:37:10,847 --> 00:37:11,994
Good morning.

558
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,305
Good morning.

559
00:37:20,153 --> 00:37:21,947
Thanks for saving the Irishman.

560
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,622
He'd be dead if it wasn't for you.

561
00:37:28,043 --> 00:37:29,314
You're welcome.

562
00:37:33,229 --> 00:37:34,800
Can I ask you a question?

563
00:37:36,071 --> 00:37:37,939
I'm tired.
I'm not really up for a fight.

564
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,309
I'm not gonna fight.

565
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:42,783
I'm just trying to...
figure out what's going on.

566
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,624
You and Jax are
obviously reconnected.

567
00:37:46,744 --> 00:37:47,754
Honestly?

568
00:37:49,457 --> 00:37:50,813
I don't know what we are.

569
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,851
That's what concerns me.

570
00:37:55,016 --> 00:37:57,715
You're clearly not one of them.

571
00:37:58,728 --> 00:38:01,490
- I'm glad that's clear.
- So what happens next?

572
00:38:06,356 --> 00:38:07,504
I don't know.

573
00:38:08,573 --> 00:38:10,374
You become his old lady?

574
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:12,948
What's that look like?

575
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:15,877
Operating on kids during the day,

576
00:38:16,117 --> 00:38:19,238
- patching up bullet wounds at night.
- Okay, I get it.

577
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:21,650
I know you hate me,

578
00:38:22,577 --> 00:38:25,810
but this isn't me being
some overbearing bitch.

579
00:38:27,781 --> 00:38:30,061
This is someone telling you
the truth.

580
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,894
You and Jax is a bad idea,

581
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:35,596
and someone'd
better start thinking clearly

582
00:38:35,716 --> 00:38:37,735
before both of you get hurt.

583
00:38:47,905 --> 00:38:51,819
Well, it wouldn't be my first bad idea.
Seems to follow me wherever I go.

584
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,391
You know...

585
00:39:00,593 --> 00:39:02,009
you are smarter

586
00:39:03,227 --> 00:39:04,859
and more strong-willed

587
00:39:05,872 --> 00:39:07,656
than anyone I've ever met.

588
00:39:09,865 --> 00:39:12,019
You need to shine some of that
on this thing with Jax.

589
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:16,815
He's not smart enough right now
to do what's right.

590
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,746
You have to be
the one to break this off.

591
00:39:24,341 --> 00:39:25,709
Save both of you

592
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,410
from something bad.

593
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,826
That is his green Mercedes
in the garage.

594
00:39:46,946 --> 00:39:48,118
Which apartment?

595
00:39:48,238 --> 00:39:51,107
Unit nine. It's the top floor,
third from the right.

596
00:39:51,227 --> 00:39:54,193
Cameras cover the garage.
Should do this on the upper level.

597
00:39:54,313 --> 00:39:57,356
If this guy's got half a brain,
he's going to be cautious and armed.

598
00:39:57,891 --> 00:40:01,017
Look, anyone walks into this,
has an eye line, we abort.

599
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:02,137
No risks.

600
00:40:03,075 --> 00:40:05,325
Opie, you take the front steps.
I'll take the back.

601
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,078
- You stay, in case he gets by.
- No.

602
00:40:07,818 --> 00:40:10,786
I'm gonna take the front.
This is the way Clay wanted it.

603
00:40:11,229 --> 00:40:13,205
It's about Ope jumping backin.

604
00:40:15,804 --> 00:40:16,804
I know.

605
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,807
All right.
Watch him.

606
00:40:21,543 --> 00:40:24,005
All right, I got your back
in case he gets by you.

607
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:27,009
The second this goes down,
I'm in the car, motor running.

608
00:40:40,242 --> 00:40:41,331
Hey, relax?

609
00:40:41,661 --> 00:40:43,117
Shit happens, man.

610
00:40:43,713 --> 00:40:44,879
Yeah, I know.

611
00:40:46,373 --> 00:40:47,534
I'm sorry, Pop.

612
00:40:49,176 --> 00:40:52,401
Because of your mistake,
I had a sit-down with Sam Crow.

613
00:40:52,521 --> 00:40:55,498
Made a deal with him.
He's going to start selling us guns.

614
00:40:58,175 --> 00:41:00,911
- That's good, man.
- That happened because of you, okay?

615
00:41:02,191 --> 00:41:03,648
It's okay, man.

616
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:08,636
Let's go get a churro.

617
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,612
Catch you up on what we got to do.

618
00:41:38,643 --> 00:41:39,643
Shit.

619
00:41:40,502 --> 00:41:41,502
Shit.

620
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,181
I love you, mi hijo.

621
00:44:09,629 --> 00:44:13,633
