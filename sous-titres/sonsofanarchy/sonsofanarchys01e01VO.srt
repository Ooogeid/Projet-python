1
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:01,981
- They sell birdseed, I see.
- You kidding me, man?

2
00:01:02,142 --> 00:01:03,999
- In the back.
- All right.

3
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:07,982
White boy was right.

4
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,509
M-4s.

5
00:01:13,502 --> 00:01:15,381
Niners had a special order.

6
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:16,970
Full auto,

7
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:18,495
laser scopes.

8
00:01:18,907 --> 00:01:20,957
Niggers still couldn't hit shit.

9
00:01:27,464 --> 00:01:29,675
Load the M-4s and Glocks
in the truck, huh?

10
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:41,970
What about the other guns and shit?

11
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,910
Torch it.

12
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:12,832
Hey, Louise.

13
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:18,390
You know, you can buy these by the case.

14
00:02:19,344 --> 00:02:20,694
Be a lot cheaper.

15
00:02:21,513 --> 00:02:23,862
No. A box at a time keeps me humble.

16
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:26,470
Get a pack of smokes, too, darling.

17
00:02:43,223 --> 00:02:44,673
It was my favorite.

18
00:02:48,098 --> 00:02:49,648
What the hell is that?

19
00:02:56,912 --> 00:02:57,899
Oh, shit!

20
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,462
What the hell happened?

21
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:05,942
Propane tanks caught fire.

22
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:08,572
Ammo was in there. The place just blew.

23
00:04:09,086 --> 00:04:09,990
Shit!

24
00:04:10,912 --> 00:04:12,504
The fire dick says it was arson.

25
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,169
Saw a lot of boot prints.

26
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:15,993
- Cowboy boots?
- Yeah. I think so.

27
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:17,813
Shit-eating Mayans, man.

28
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:21,365
- Where the hell was Rodrigo?
- No sign of your watchman.

29
00:04:22,446 --> 00:04:23,913
What's the exposure?

30
00:04:24,172 --> 00:04:25,226
Officially?

31
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:27,763
Me and the fire department.

32
00:04:27,883 --> 00:04:30,668
The fire captain can be convinced
to rethink his report.

33
00:04:30,788 --> 00:04:31,938
Unofficially?

34
00:04:32,058 --> 00:04:34,264
Unofficially,
this blast was seen in two counties.

35
00:04:34,384 --> 00:04:36,026
This location is dead.

36
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:38,257
Jesus Christ.

37
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:42,473
- The M-4s?
- Gone.

38
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:45,291
As are most of the Glocks.

39
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:50,792
Get the fireman on board.

40
00:04:51,102 --> 00:04:53,378
Don't want this shit
hitting ATF's radar.

41
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:57,748
Let's get out of here.

42
00:04:58,488 --> 00:05:00,531
You gotta see something else.

43
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:02,939
Do we really?

44
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:06,882
Goddamn.

45
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:09,512
Fried and refried.

46
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:12,397
Illegals. Part of our assembly crew.

47
00:05:12,663 --> 00:05:15,013
Found them before the FD went through.

48
00:05:16,013 --> 00:05:17,527
After the smoke clears,

49
00:05:18,338 --> 00:05:19,489
get rid of the bodies.

50
00:05:19,782 --> 00:05:22,241
What am I supposed to tell
our boys up in Oaktown?

51
00:05:22,515 --> 00:05:24,047
I'm supposed to deliver five cases

52
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:25,912
to Laroy and his crew
before tomorrow{\ morning}.

53
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:28,635
Call the gangsta hotline, set a meeting.

54
00:05:34,665 --> 00:05:37,612
Two in the back of the head.
Quick and painless.

55
00:05:37,732 --> 00:05:39,482
It ain't easy being king.

56
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:41,142
You remember that.

57
00:06:13,327 --> 00:06:14,891
1x01: Pilot

58
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,706
{\pos(190,220)}Some days you're the Beamer,

59
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,130
{\pos(190,220)}some days you're the goddamn deer.

60
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:45,506
{\pos(190,230)}Some yuppie creamed it out
by the streams.

61
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:49,119
{\pos(190,230)}He run into it or hit a tree
while it was giving him head?

62
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:52,429
How the hell you you want me
to get it out of there?

63
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:02,299
Come on. Jesus, man.

64
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,093
Just pretend it's "carve
your own steak night" at Sizzler.

65
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:07,657
I don't eat meat, man.

66
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:10,140
Figure it out, grunt.

67
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,320
What the hell happened?

68
00:07:17,634 --> 00:07:19,611
{\pos(190,230)}Mayans torched the warehouse.

69
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:22,660
{\pos(190,230)}- Stole the Niners' M-4s.
- Holy shit.

70
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:24,988
{\pos(190,230)}Clay's gone to sit down with Laroy,

71
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:26,448
{\pos(190,230)}try to buy some time.

72
00:07:26,568 --> 00:07:28,988
{\pos(190,230)}Niners already paid for that hardware.

73
00:07:29,108 --> 00:07:30,758
{\pos(190,230)}That's the tricky part.

74
00:07:34,544 --> 00:07:35,483
Hey, Ma.

75
00:07:35,785 --> 00:07:37,426
Did you go to storage?

76
00:07:37,546 --> 00:07:38,418
<i>Not yet.</i>

77
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,687
{\pos(190,200)}Hope there's something you can use.

78
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:42,714
{\pos(190,200)}Haven't looked through that baby stuff
in years.

79
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:44,633
I'm sure anything will help.

80
00:07:44,794 --> 00:07:46,882
<i>Still coming to dinner tomorrow night?</i>

81
00:07:47,002 --> 00:07:48,679
<i>I'm picking up steaks from the German.</i>

82
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:50,296
Oh, you know it.

83
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:52,724
You should bring Chibs and that new kid.

84
00:07:54,971 --> 00:07:56,437
New kid doesn't eat meat.

85
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:02,192
<i>Don't patch him in.</i>
Can't trust anyone doesn't eat meat.

86
00:08:02,353 --> 00:08:04,611
Hey, you heard from
my crazy ex-wife at all?

87
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:06,412
{\a6}Never answers her goddamn phone.

88
00:08:06,532 --> 00:08:08,031
{\a6}That's 'cause she knows it's you.

89
00:08:08,192 --> 00:08:11,410
She's supposed to be sending me the
doctor bills. Haven't seen one in weeks.

90
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:15,247
{\pos(190,220)}I'll go by on my way home.
I'll check in on her.

91
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:16,421
Thanks...

92
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:17,792
Grandma.

93
00:08:18,952 --> 00:08:19,880
Asshole.

94
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:07,425
{\pos(190,200)}Long ride from Charming to Oakland.

95
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:10,668
How come Easy Rider
meeting me face to face?

96
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:16,222
Assembly warehouse burned down.

97
00:09:17,085 --> 00:09:19,263
All the guns, including your M-4s,

98
00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:22,012
blown to shit.

99
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,959
There's zero balance
due on that hardware.

100
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:26,351
The shipment

101
00:09:26,863 --> 00:09:29,154
- going to be a little late.
- That can't happen.

102
00:09:29,673 --> 00:09:31,679
Got a shipment of my own coming in.

103
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,349
Very important cargo.

104
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,802
I been doing business with
the One-Niners for a long time.

105
00:09:36,922 --> 00:09:38,538
I always respected our arrangement.

106
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,872
I never sold "gun one" to the Mexicans.

107
00:09:42,424 --> 00:09:45,274
Now I need for you
to show me a little respect,

108
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:48,250
and give me a few more days
for delivery.

109
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,104
Don't give a shit
about history or respect.

110
00:09:52,395 --> 00:09:54,480
This is about business, old man.

111
00:09:55,364 --> 00:09:56,814
And I'm telling you,

112
00:09:57,451 --> 00:09:58,378
brother,

113
00:09:59,394 --> 00:10:01,273
giving me some more time...

114
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:03,883
really smart business.

115
00:10:09,737 --> 00:10:11,187
You got till Sunday.

116
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:14,429
I don't get those M-4s by then,
there's going to be some new black faces

117
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:16,699
cruising the streets of Charming.

118
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:20,902
And a burned-down warehouse going to be
the least of your problems.

119
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,109
<i>"For my sons.</i>

120
00:11:47,229 --> 00:11:49,216
<i>"Thomas, who is already at peace.</i>

121
00:11:49,336 --> 00:11:52,528
<i>"And Jackson,
may he never know this life of chaos."</i>

122
00:12:08,305 --> 00:12:10,024
- Just here.
- Half-Sack.

123
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,192
Piney clogged the toilet again.

124
00:12:12,353 --> 00:12:15,362
Jesus Christ. That guy shits more
than a grizzly, man. It ain't human.

125
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:19,843
Here, just put it right here
under the...

126
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,092
Where did you get that name?

127
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:25,042
Half-Sack?

128
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,099
Oh, man,

129
00:12:27,077 --> 00:12:30,227
I got my left nut blown off
by an aper frag in Iraq.

130
00:12:30,347 --> 00:12:32,044
- Look at that guy.
- Jesus Christ!

131
00:12:32,164 --> 00:12:33,964
Put that deformed nut bag away,
will you?

132
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:36,032
- Sorry, pal.
- Disappear.

133
00:12:36,152 --> 00:12:37,152
Go on.

134
00:12:39,465 --> 00:12:40,498
Find Jax.

135
00:12:42,151 --> 00:12:43,151
Jax...!

136
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:55,551
Hey, Jax!

137
00:12:55,956 --> 00:12:57,779
- We're at the table.
- Okay.

138
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:36,965
Wendy!

139
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:45,977
Stupid junkie bitch.

140
00:13:49,594 --> 00:13:52,158
You got one more day out of Laroy,
that's it.

141
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:54,551
Niners are expecting
a huge heroin shipment.

142
00:13:54,671 --> 00:13:56,794
The carbines are for protection.

143
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,720
What happens if those Mayans crash

144
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,190
that dope party with the Laroy's M-4s?

145
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,139
We lose all the Niner business,
buy ourselves a huge black...

146
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,974
That ain't gonna happen.

147
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,340
These Mexi-assholes
come into our territory,

148
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:13,242
they steal from us,

149
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:15,568
they shit on our livelihood.

150
00:14:16,446 --> 00:14:19,052
I don't care who we got
to grease or kill,

151
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:21,404
I want those goddamned guns back.

152
00:14:21,857 --> 00:14:24,658
{\All right,}Me and Chibs will pull together
all our current intel on the Mayans.

153
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:28,157
Juice, start hacking
into crime databases.

154
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:30,497
Get addresses on any Mayans
in the system.

155
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:32,472
Wherever you find those guns, Bobby,

156
00:14:32,592 --> 00:14:35,335
I want to Fat Man and Little Boy
every inch of that goddamn place.

157
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:36,981
Bobby's got Tahoe this weekend.

158
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:40,527
- No, I'm canceling that shit.{\- No, man}
- I should be able to decide...

159
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:43,478
You got two ex-wives who already
spent the goddamned casino checks.

160
00:14:43,598 --> 00:14:46,679
Last thing we need is PIs
and lawyers camping out out front.

161
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,932
And whose gonna handle the pyro,
I'm not there?

162
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:50,892
Nobody blows up shit better than Opie.

163
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:53,957
- Opie's leaning right these days.
- Opie's gonna lean

164
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,240
any way we need him to.

165
00:14:57,467 --> 00:14:59,017
You get him on board.

166
00:15:07,502 --> 00:15:10,719
So you're sure you're okay
with me stepping away from this?

167
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,372
Yeah, yeah, take the prospect with you.

168
00:15:14,118 --> 00:15:15,490
I'll get him half-laid.

169
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:17,710
What is that smell?

170
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,061
Oh, shit.

171
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:26,946
- I tried calling you.
- What is it?

172
00:15:27,751 --> 00:15:30,980
I found these matches next
to a bunch of her empty thumb bags.

173
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,718
- Hairy Dog.
- Shit.

174
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,475
Got to be the Nords,
dealing out the Dog again.

175
00:15:35,595 --> 00:15:37,784
Darby got out of Chino two weeks ago.

176
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:40,554
Well, call that Nazi prick,
set a meeting.

177
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,908
- What the hell happened?
- When was the last time you saw her?

178
00:15:51,028 --> 00:15:52,278
Couple of weeks.

179
00:15:52,903 --> 00:15:54,622
Her hands and feet were full of tracks.

180
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:58,543
Toxicology reports aren't back yet,
but most likely crank.

181
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:02,010
The baby.

182
00:16:02,585 --> 00:16:04,424
We had to do an emergency C-section.

183
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,426
He's ten weeks premature.

184
00:16:07,692 --> 00:16:08,702
Holy shit.

185
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,438
Come on, let's sit down
and I'll walk you through it.

186
00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:12,765
Just tell me.

187
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:16,549
He's got a congenital heart defect

188
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:20,064
and gastroschis...
a tear in his abdomen.

189
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:22,984
The gastro and the early birth
are from the drugs,

190
00:16:23,471 --> 00:16:24,996
but the CHD is probably...

191
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:27,286
- The family flaw.
- Yes, it's genetic.

192
00:16:27,406 --> 00:16:29,845
Either one would be serious,
but not life-threatening.

193
00:16:29,965 --> 00:16:32,118
However, the two of them together...

194
00:16:34,418 --> 00:16:37,295
Dr. Namid gives him a 20 percent chance,

195
00:16:38,222 --> 00:16:40,126
and I'm afraid that's being optimistic.

196
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:42,289
Oh, my God.

197
00:16:43,522 --> 00:16:46,516
She never wanted to talk to me.
I didn't know.

198
00:16:46,636 --> 00:16:49,511
Her OB said she missed her last three
appointments. No one knew.

199
00:16:49,827 --> 00:16:52,102
Dr. Namid wants to fix his belly first,
then,

200
00:16:52,222 --> 00:16:54,724
if he stabilizes,
he'll go in and try to repair the heart.

201
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:56,915
I'm sorry, Jax.

202
00:16:59,122 --> 00:17:01,142
I can take you to see him now.

203
00:17:04,408 --> 00:17:05,326
Tara...

204
00:17:08,593 --> 00:17:09,864
You don't have to do this.

205
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:14,237
- I'm sure you got other patients.
- I asked Dr. Namid if I could assist.

206
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:16,183
I want to help your son.

207
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,158
His name's Abel.

208
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:23,112
That's a good name.

209
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:28,133
Jax...

210
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:30,922
- Jackson...
- Go with Tara.

211
00:17:31,211 --> 00:17:32,771
I got something to do.

212
00:17:36,612 --> 00:17:38,184
Watch his back.

213
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:02,300
Sell crank to my pregnant ex-wife.

214
00:18:06,705 --> 00:18:07,548
Easy, boys.

215
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,675
Hey, brother!

216
00:18:09,992 --> 00:18:12,071
I think you made your point.

217
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,125
Stupid peckerwood shithead!

218
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,182
Enjoy your lunch.

219
00:18:21,138 --> 00:18:22,895
Shish-ka-balls are on me.

220
00:18:42,847 --> 00:18:44,362
- You okay?
- Yeah.

221
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:46,900
I'm gonna go find Ope.

222
00:19:05,702 --> 00:19:07,441
So everybody's saying
it was a gun factory

223
00:19:07,601 --> 00:19:09,795
that blew up out by the streams
last night.

224
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:10,880
Mayans hit us.

225
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,330
Stole our M-4s.

226
00:19:13,223 --> 00:19:14,947
- We need you.
- For what?

227
00:19:15,424 --> 00:19:17,322
Bobby's got a gig this weekend.

228
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:20,119
- No way, man.
- We got to get in and out fast.

229
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,787
You're the {\only }guy who can pull it off.

230
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:24,729
You think I want to be here
chipping wood for shit pay?

231
00:19:24,849 --> 00:19:26,936
I made a promise to Donna.
I'm earning straight.

232
00:19:27,056 --> 00:19:29,390
Come on, Opie. We all earn straight.

233
00:19:29,788 --> 00:19:32,750
I spend 40 hours a week with
a goddamn power tool in my hand.

234
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,511
When you're on Clay's payroll,
everything in your hand is a power tool.

235
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,457
You're saying "no" to the club?

236
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:46,510
Everything turned to shit
since I got out.

237
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,940
I'm in debt up to my eyeballs.

238
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,065
My kids hardly know me.

239
00:19:51,436 --> 00:19:55,167
I even mention Sam Crow to Donna,
she's gonna bust out crying.

240
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,420
Look, man, if you need money...

241
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,039
I don't want to borrow, I want to earn.

242
00:20:06,976 --> 00:20:10,253
Family's just got to adjust to you
being around again.

243
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:12,547
Kids got to get used
to how ugly their dad is.

244
00:20:15,144 --> 00:20:17,140
Donna knows what the life is.

245
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:21,139
You leave a woman alone
for five years, two kids,

246
00:20:21,406 --> 00:20:25,184
the only thing that she knows is that
she doesn't want it to happen again.

247
00:20:28,724 --> 00:20:30,444
Break's over, let's go!

248
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:40,121
Let me know when you need me.

249
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:45,978
What's the, uh,
Nord's roster looking like these days?

250
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,693
15, 16 guys,

251
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:50,464
a few new kids breaking in.

252
00:20:51,062 --> 00:20:52,800
Same extreme hate shit.

253
00:20:53,872 --> 00:20:56,048
Still got meth labs outside of Lodi,

254
00:20:56,168 --> 00:20:58,843
selling mostly to truckers,
some of the Mexi gangs.

255
00:20:59,144 --> 00:21:01,137
You think they're stepping up?

256
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:05,105
Only two things feel good in the joint,

257
00:21:05,225 --> 00:21:07,186
that's jerking off
and thinking about all the shit

258
00:21:07,306 --> 00:21:08,936
you're gonna do when you get out.

259
00:21:09,056 --> 00:21:11,199
Darby's been in there for three years.

260
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:14,192
I just want to make sure all his
big-shot dreams ended up in his cum rag,

261
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:16,485
and not on his to-do list.

262
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:20,548
How's his guy doing?

263
00:21:20,668 --> 00:21:21,918
Fractured cheek,

264
00:21:22,231 --> 00:21:23,381
broken nose...

265
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:27,218
- left nut swinging solo.
- Yes, it was beautiful!

266
00:21:30,232 --> 00:21:32,461
Yeah, he's lucky to be breathing.

267
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,214
Any luck up north?

268
00:21:36,374 --> 00:21:39,258
Tacoma could help with the Glocks,
but there's no M-4s anywhere.

269
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,845
Washington state,
Oregon, Nevada, nobody's got stock, man.

270
00:21:43,188 --> 00:21:45,340
We'll have all the Mayan intel
by the morning.

271
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,725
We'll get our guns back.

272
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,455
Oh, yeah, we will.

273
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:50,646
Treasury?

274
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,195
All the bills are paid,

275
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:55,441
bar's stocked.

276
00:21:56,235 --> 00:21:58,985
Run fund is covered
for the next two months.

277
00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:01,937
Tig's the only man who owes me dues.

278
00:22:02,057 --> 00:22:04,284
I'm a little short.
Catch you next week.

279
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:07,453
Guess those little Thai boys
are getting expensive.

280
00:22:07,997 --> 00:22:09,312
Yeah, they are.

281
00:22:09,582 --> 00:22:12,882
How about I slit your eyes
and have you suck my dick.

282
00:22:13,371 --> 00:22:14,921
All right, all right.

283
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,256
- Anything else?
- Yeah, I...

284
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:20,529
I just want to say
to Jackson, on a club level,

285
00:22:21,544 --> 00:22:24,595
the Sons of Anarchy,
the Redwood Original, is here for you.

286
00:22:25,983 --> 00:22:28,474
Your father'd be proud of the man
you've become, you know.

287
00:22:29,129 --> 00:22:31,227
Every time I see you sitting
at this table,

288
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,063
I do a double take.

289
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,815
That's probably just the weed, Pop.

290
00:22:37,012 --> 00:22:38,867
Probably. I bet it is, yeah.

291
00:22:41,484 --> 00:22:42,436
Anyway...

292
00:22:43,352 --> 00:22:44,866
whatever you need, son,

293
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:47,614
- it's yours.
- Thank you, Piney.

294
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:48,884
Thanks, boys.

295
00:22:50,747 --> 00:22:52,049
Meeting closed.

296
00:22:56,548 --> 00:22:58,296
- Here you go, Clay.
- Thanks, kid.

297
00:22:58,416 --> 00:22:59,835
- Bobby?
- Yeah?

298
00:23:01,273 --> 00:23:03,208
What the hell is that smell?

299
00:23:05,504 --> 00:23:06,808
I smell it, too.

300
00:23:11,251 --> 00:23:12,185
It's that box.

301
00:23:12,742 --> 00:23:14,727
- What is it?
- I don't know.

302
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:21,068
Goddamn...

303
00:23:21,188 --> 00:23:22,571
- Oh! Geez!
- That's mine.

304
00:23:22,731 --> 00:23:24,073
You out of your goddamn mind?

305
00:23:24,193 --> 00:23:27,241
No, I just... you know,
I thought, it was like a surprise.

306
00:23:27,423 --> 00:23:30,912
We could mount it in the club,
you know, like, on the wall.

307
00:23:31,189 --> 00:23:33,665
It's g to stuffed and treated,
you idiot.

308
00:23:33,825 --> 00:23:35,545
Yeah, I know, I just...

309
00:23:37,177 --> 00:23:38,544
Stuffed with what?

310
00:23:58,505 --> 00:23:59,738
Did Rosen

311
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:03,229
track down any real estate
for the rebuild?

312
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:05,697
Ten acres for sale up north of 84.

313
00:24:06,766 --> 00:24:08,158
You know, the stretch industry,

314
00:24:08,493 --> 00:24:10,797
paint factories, container yards...

315
00:24:11,363 --> 00:24:12,526
Kick his ass!

316
00:24:13,066 --> 00:24:15,790
Trucking in supplies will look
like regular business.

317
00:24:17,193 --> 00:24:18,834
What'd happen if we didn't rebuild?

318
00:24:23,322 --> 00:24:24,590
What do you mean?

319
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:27,218
Take the land profit,
put it in something else.

320
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:32,680
I'm just thinking about
what's best long-term.

321
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,364
We got heat with the Mayans.

322
00:24:34,484 --> 00:24:36,134
ATF crawling up our ass.

323
00:24:36,514 --> 00:24:38,521
Might be time to look
at other ways to earn.

324
00:24:39,614 --> 00:24:42,063
Yeah, well, there's a lot of shit
up in the air right now.

325
00:24:42,183 --> 00:24:44,670
We'll figure out what the next move is.

326
00:24:48,176 --> 00:24:49,926
Bobby, break that shit up.

327
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,010
All right, all right.

328
00:24:52,988 --> 00:24:54,332
Stop. You know.

329
00:24:56,587 --> 00:24:57,714
Hug it out.

330
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:04,080
You doing okay?

331
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:09,118
Your mom says you haven't been back
to the hospital.

332
00:25:09,238 --> 00:25:12,373
Don't worry about this Mayan shit.
You need to focus on your family.

333
00:25:12,493 --> 00:25:14,992
Come on, man, don't push me out of this.

334
00:25:15,884 --> 00:25:18,018
I know you're all spun out
over Wendy and the kid.

335
00:25:18,432 --> 00:25:20,438
Understandable; it's awful shit.

336
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:21,981
But your father and I,

337
00:25:22,365 --> 00:25:24,483
we worked hard to create this business.

338
00:25:25,053 --> 00:25:26,303
We served time.

339
00:25:27,176 --> 00:25:29,446
We lost brothers.
We spilled lot of blood.

340
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:32,591
And you're gonna need this now,
more than ever.

341
00:25:32,803 --> 00:25:35,153
A sick kid, it's an expensive burden.

342
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:40,691
You want to do the right thing
by your family.

343
00:25:41,736 --> 00:25:42,697
Don't you?

344
00:25:45,656 --> 00:25:46,431
Yeah.

345
00:25:46,842 --> 00:25:47,840
Of course.

346
00:25:48,001 --> 00:25:49,884
Well, then, go see your son.

347
00:26:16,555 --> 00:26:18,805
I didn't think you'd want to see me.

348
00:26:24,075 --> 00:26:25,466
Everyone hates me.

349
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:29,828
I'm sorry, Jax. I'm so sorry.

350
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,636
Please don't hate me.

351
00:26:34,151 --> 00:26:36,934
- You need to get help, Wendy.
- I know, I know.

352
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,504
I will, I promise. This time, I promise.

353
00:26:43,316 --> 00:26:45,829
The doctor said Abel's getting stronger.

354
00:26:48,154 --> 00:26:51,029
They said maybe they would fix his belly
tomorrow, maybe tomorrow morning.

355
00:26:51,411 --> 00:26:53,465
They'll do everything they can.

356
00:27:02,305 --> 00:27:04,250
My lawyer said they might file
criminal charges.

357
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:06,227
Fetal abuse.

358
00:27:06,943 --> 00:27:09,436
I got some stuff back at the house
in the stash drawer.

359
00:27:09,556 --> 00:27:10,706
Jesus Christ.

360
00:27:10,947 --> 00:27:14,262
It's just if they find that shit,
they're gonna put me away.

361
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,678
You own the house, Jax.

362
00:27:16,364 --> 00:27:18,430
I hate to see this blow back on you.

363
00:27:18,591 --> 00:27:20,497
Yeah. Of course.

364
00:27:20,617 --> 00:27:22,685
Jax, wait. Please, please, Jax.

365
00:27:23,485 --> 00:27:24,612
Please, Jax.

366
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:37,482
It's almost midnight.

367
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,916
This place is a goddamn pig sty.

368
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,790
Clean was never her strong suit.

369
00:27:46,822 --> 00:27:48,708
- What are you doing here?
- It's my house.

370
00:27:48,828 --> 00:27:51,089
You know what I mean.
I don't want you to see it this way.

371
00:27:54,397 --> 00:27:58,066
- Mom, you don't have to do this.
- I just want to get it livable.

372
00:27:58,186 --> 00:27:59,857
Buy you some decent carpet.

373
00:27:59,977 --> 00:28:01,808
- Cigarette burns everywhere.
- Mom...

374
00:28:01,968 --> 00:28:04,643
Get you outta that dorm room. Back home.

375
00:28:04,804 --> 00:28:08,203
- With your son.
- Mom, for Christ's sake, stop cleaning!

376
00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:13,251
He's not gonna make it.

377
00:28:13,371 --> 00:28:15,363
What are you talking about?
What happened?

378
00:28:15,523 --> 00:28:19,158
He was born with half a stomach
and a hole in his heart. He's gonna die.

379
00:28:20,995 --> 00:28:22,328
Don't you say that.

380
00:28:22,677 --> 00:28:24,622
You are theonlyone this boy's got.

381
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:27,397
You don't believe he's gonna live,
you might {\as well }go down there

382
00:28:27,517 --> 00:28:29,192
and kill him yourself.

383
00:28:45,938 --> 00:28:46,889
I'm sorry.

384
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,796
You gotta go see him, Jax.

385
00:28:54,536 --> 00:28:55,534
I can't.

386
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:57,190
Why?

387
00:29:00,046 --> 00:29:01,493
He'll break your heart.

388
00:29:02,982 --> 00:29:05,875
- It's called being a father.
- For how long?

389
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,060
A day?

390
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,125
A week?

391
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:25,389
You know...

392
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:29,228
You were born with that same
heart defect your little brother had.

393
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:34,983
You seem pretty sturdy to me.

394
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,237
I came through hell.

395
00:29:37,554 --> 00:29:38,695
Landed on my feet.

396
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,700
Your father was

397
00:29:40,824 --> 00:29:42,574
hit by a goddamn semi.

398
00:29:42,834 --> 00:29:44,760
Dragged 178 yards.

399
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,443
And that bastard lived
for two more days.

400
00:29:48,637 --> 00:29:50,082
Tellers do not die easy.

401
00:29:50,826 --> 00:29:52,476
No, we just die bloody.

402
00:29:55,219 --> 00:29:56,914
That's the Irish in us.

403
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,090
When you and Dad hooked up...

404
00:30:04,132 --> 00:30:06,554
He ever talk to you about his vision?

405
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,514
About what he wanted from the club?

406
00:30:11,141 --> 00:30:12,491
His vision was...

407
00:30:13,221 --> 00:30:14,301
you know...

408
00:30:15,388 --> 00:30:16,388
what it is.

409
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,980
A brotherhood.

410
00:30:19,454 --> 00:30:20,463
Family.

411
00:30:22,766 --> 00:30:24,116
And running guns?

412
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,290
He want that?

413
00:30:26,863 --> 00:30:28,969
We never talked about that. Why?

414
00:30:32,046 --> 00:30:34,293
Found a box of his old shit
in the storage unit.

415
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:36,817
Just like pictures and journals.

416
00:30:39,015 --> 00:30:40,507
Things I never knew about him.

417
00:30:41,254 --> 00:30:42,346
What kind of things?

418
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:45,888
Seems like his original idea
for the MC was something simpler.

419
00:30:46,598 --> 00:30:47,974
You know, social rebellion.

420
00:30:48,253 --> 00:30:50,270
He called it a Harley commune.

421
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,312
It wasn't outlaw,
it was real hippie shit.

422
00:30:52,432 --> 00:30:55,635
We had a lot of bright ideas back then.
We were kids.

423
00:30:56,915 --> 00:30:58,767
Your father became a man.

424
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:00,639
Men take care of business.

425
00:31:02,855 --> 00:31:03,941
Yeah, we do.

426
00:31:06,683 --> 00:31:07,951
You should get home, Mom.

427
00:31:08,071 --> 00:31:10,569
Finish cleaning tomorrow. I'll lock up.

428
00:31:16,044 --> 00:31:17,253
Okay, darling.

429
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:21,167
Good night, Mom.

430
00:31:21,808 --> 00:31:23,158
Good night, baby.

431
00:32:08,588 --> 00:32:10,325
How are the hands, baby?

432
00:32:12,145 --> 00:32:13,640
It's just the damp.

433
00:32:14,148 --> 00:32:15,427
Where you been?

434
00:32:16,252 --> 00:32:17,802
Cleaning up at Jax's.

435
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,547
Of course you were.

436
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:36,832
All this stuff with Abel's pushing
some old buttons, huh?

437
00:32:37,114 --> 00:32:39,486
It's not my buttons I'm worried about.

438
00:32:41,153 --> 00:32:42,921
Jax is going through some shit.

439
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:45,586
Yeah.

440
00:32:46,052 --> 00:32:47,003
I know.

441
00:32:48,004 --> 00:32:49,554
Not just with the kid.

442
00:32:50,438 --> 00:32:51,788
What do you mean?

443
00:32:52,226 --> 00:32:54,966
He found a box
of John's stuff in storage.

444
00:32:56,002 --> 00:32:58,520
He was asking me about
his original vision for the club.

445
00:32:59,153 --> 00:33:01,194
Did he want to get into running guns.

446
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:04,449
Tonight he said that maybe
we shouldn't rebuild the factory.

447
00:33:04,569 --> 00:33:05,494
Shit.

448
00:33:05,752 --> 00:33:08,171
He's getting chewed up by that guilt.

449
00:33:09,568 --> 00:33:11,518
Remorse is a dangerous thing.

450
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:14,029
Look what Tommy's death did to John.

451
00:33:14,336 --> 00:33:15,204
Changed him.

452
00:33:15,629 --> 00:33:16,841
Made him soft.

453
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:21,351
You've gotta nail Jax down.

454
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:25,047
You have to nail him down hard, Clay.

455
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:26,601
Whatever it takes.

456
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:29,634
I don't want the ghost of John Teller
poisoning him,

457
00:33:29,754 --> 00:33:33,570
- ruining everything we've built.
- Nothing is gonna get ruined, okay?

458
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,899
Just don't throw your panic
into high gear.

459
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:37,237
They respect him.

460
00:33:37,357 --> 00:33:40,091
Jax is strong,
and when you step down as...

461
00:33:41,535 --> 00:33:43,191
I'm not going anywhere.

462
00:33:44,942 --> 00:33:46,092
I know, baby.

463
00:33:47,574 --> 00:33:48,537
I know.

464
00:33:50,253 --> 00:33:51,303
It's just...

465
00:33:52,502 --> 00:33:54,452
When you can't ride anymore...

466
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:58,116
They'll vote my son in as president.

467
00:33:59,785 --> 00:34:03,784
I just want to make sure he's following
in the right father's footsteps.

468
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:31,793
A little get-well present
for your guy, Darby.

469
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:34,449
That's some serious iron.
Izzy'll like that. Thank you.

470
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,327
Figured we'd give him something
that had some balls.

471
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:42,696
I know what it's like running a crew.
Sometimes your guys do shit...

472
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,501
without thinking things through.

473
00:34:44,662 --> 00:34:46,099
My guys are thinking just fine.

474
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:48,964
They thinking fine when they sold crank
to my pregnant ex?

475
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:50,620
That was unfortunate.

476
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,051
How's your little family doing, anyway?

477
00:34:57,798 --> 00:35:00,559
All right, all right,
everybody contain your shit.

478
00:35:00,721 --> 00:35:01,694
Get off!

479
00:35:04,151 --> 00:35:05,707
- You done?
- Yeah.

480
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,800
Sorry, folks.

481
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:11,193
Go back to your corndogs.

482
00:35:11,313 --> 00:35:12,960
Won't happen again.

483
00:35:13,281 --> 00:35:15,045
I made sure the brotherhood
had Opie's back

484
00:35:15,165 --> 00:35:17,144
every minute {\that }he was in Chino,
and you know that.

485
00:35:17,264 --> 00:35:19,140
Oh, I know how it works inside, Darby.

486
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,432
Question is: do you remember
how it works outside?

487
00:35:22,568 --> 00:35:25,818
- A lot changes in three years.
- A lot stays the same.

488
00:35:28,883 --> 00:35:31,633
Nothing happens in Charming
we don't control,

489
00:35:32,574 --> 00:35:33,981
or get a piece of.

490
00:35:34,818 --> 00:35:36,596
If we wanted a meth trade,

491
00:35:36,756 --> 00:35:37,963
we'd have one.

492
00:35:39,232 --> 00:35:41,057
- We don't.
- You know the drill.

493
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:44,769
I mean, you can cook all the crank
you want along the border,

494
00:35:46,197 --> 00:35:48,966
but you do not deal in Charming.

495
00:35:49,086 --> 00:35:50,834
{\You know,}We ain't the only cook shop in town.

496
00:35:50,954 --> 00:35:53,112
Devil wants in, he'll get in.

497
00:35:53,441 --> 00:35:55,490
Well, then you got
your work cut out for you.

498
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:59,222
'Cause the next time the devil
crosses the border...

499
00:36:02,819 --> 00:36:04,369
I'm coming after you.

500
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:09,404
And next time I'm not going to use a.357

501
00:36:09,524 --> 00:36:10,921
as a get-well present.

502
00:36:13,627 --> 00:36:15,576
There's no need to be making threats,
brother.

503
00:36:15,696 --> 00:36:18,813
Me and my boys have always managed
to make things work with Sam Crow.

504
00:36:18,933 --> 00:36:19,870
Good.

505
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,187
Milk and cookies are on us.

506
00:36:34,517 --> 00:36:36,232
Abel's stomach surgery went well,

507
00:36:36,352 --> 00:36:38,032
but it's putting a strain on his system.

508
00:36:38,344 --> 00:36:41,244
Dr. Namid doesn't want to wait.
{\Thinks }We should do the heart surgery now.

509
00:36:41,517 --> 00:36:43,452
That's good, right?
That they're not waiting?

510
00:36:43,572 --> 00:36:44,914
It's the best choice, yes.

511
00:36:46,196 --> 00:36:47,196
Thanks.

512
00:36:47,426 --> 00:36:48,533
Can we talk?

513
00:36:51,448 --> 00:36:52,379
What is it?

514
00:36:53,762 --> 00:36:55,612
Wendy's in really bad shape.

515
00:36:56,095 --> 00:36:57,704
She's still detoxing.

516
00:36:57,824 --> 00:36:59,174
Can't stop crying.

517
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,286
And?

518
00:37:02,249 --> 00:37:04,015
I was hoping
maybe you could talk to her.

519
00:37:04,197 --> 00:37:06,547
Just let her know she's not all alone.

520
00:37:07,511 --> 00:37:08,511
Trust me,

521
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:10,640
nothing I'm going to say
to that crank whore

522
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,892
is going to make her feel loved.

523
00:37:13,012 --> 00:37:15,362
Forgot just how forthright you can be.

524
00:37:16,042 --> 00:37:18,525
You forgot a lot of things, sweetheart.

525
00:37:19,058 --> 00:37:21,700
If you have a problem with me assisting
on Abel's case,

526
00:37:21,861 --> 00:37:23,954
- just say so.
- You a good doctor?

527
00:37:24,074 --> 00:37:25,704
- Then I don't have a problem.
- Good.

528
00:37:26,016 --> 00:37:27,214
People change.

529
00:37:28,008 --> 00:37:29,833
I'm not the same girl
I was ten years ago.

530
00:37:30,243 --> 00:37:31,002
I am.

531
00:37:34,481 --> 00:37:36,430
Guess there's some things
you can't change.

532
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,651
I leave it there

533
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:39,890
so I remember all that shit's behind me.

534
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,160
Forgot just how clever you can be.

535
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,732
Bitch.

536
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:50,576
Mayans got two shops where
they cut and bag the heroin.

537
00:37:51,231 --> 00:37:53,511
20 minutes outside of Oakland here.

538
00:37:54,137 --> 00:37:56,819
Marcus Alvarez,
president of the Oakland Charter,

539
00:37:56,979 --> 00:37:59,160
owns both buildings where they run
their dope operations.

540
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,490
Local cops are on a payroll,
so it's a no-hassle gig.

541
00:38:02,652 --> 00:38:04,055
Which makes them lazy.

542
00:38:04,175 --> 00:38:06,394
Alvarez don't try too hard
to cover his tracks.

543
00:38:06,514 --> 00:38:08,393
He also knows that we'd be onto
the cut shops.

544
00:38:08,513 --> 00:38:11,082
We wouldn't take a chance
housing the M-4's there.

545
00:38:11,264 --> 00:38:13,514
Stores them someplace off the grid.

546
00:38:13,638 --> 00:38:17,288
Backtracked one of Alvarez's
dummy corporations in San Leandro,

547
00:38:17,818 --> 00:38:20,280
along the U-Pac rail line, here.

548
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:23,427
Marcalva Industrial Storage.

549
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,362
Way off the grid.

550
00:38:27,262 --> 00:38:28,512
Good work, kids.

551
00:38:33,076 --> 00:38:34,526
What are you doing?

552
00:38:35,552 --> 00:38:36,924
Got to make a run.

553
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,690
- What's in the bag?
- Nothing.

554
00:38:51,692 --> 00:38:54,543
- You promised {\me }you were done with this.
- It's got nothing to do with you{\, Donna}.

555
00:38:54,703 --> 00:38:56,773
I'm the one who gets shit on
if you get caught again.

556
00:38:56,893 --> 00:38:59,171
- It's not going to happen.
- You sat in a cell for 5 years

557
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:01,801
while Clay and the others got rich.
They sold you out.

558
00:39:02,081 --> 00:39:03,274
You know that.

559
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,215
You're just too weak
to stand up to them.

560
00:39:06,335 --> 00:39:07,647
- Give me the bag.
- No!

561
00:39:07,767 --> 00:39:10,476
- Give me the bag!
- No! No! No!

562
00:39:13,522 --> 00:39:14,508
Stop it.

563
00:39:14,896 --> 00:39:15,835
Donna!

564
00:39:32,854 --> 00:39:34,674
Come on. Let's go inside.

565
00:39:44,953 --> 00:39:46,522
Didn't hear you pull up.

566
00:39:46,642 --> 00:39:48,021
Parked down the block.

567
00:39:48,141 --> 00:39:49,647
Didn't want to tweak Donna.

568
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:51,558
- You catch all that?
- Enough.

569
00:39:52,148 --> 00:39:53,893
I think she's already tweaked.

570
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,213
Yeah.

571
00:39:59,394 --> 00:40:01,444
Stay here. I'll handle the run.

572
00:40:02,245 --> 00:40:04,571
I don't show up,
Clay will chop off both our dicks.

573
00:40:08,081 --> 00:40:10,201
As soon as I leave,
take your kid to the E.R.

574
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,079
Tell them she hit her head{\ or something}.
Just get a record of being there.

575
00:40:13,331 --> 00:40:15,147
I'll cover you with Sam Crow.

576
00:40:15,267 --> 00:40:16,717
What about the boom?

577
00:40:16,955 --> 00:40:18,805
I watched you do it before.

578
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,462
I'll call you on the prepay
if I need help.

579
00:40:22,582 --> 00:40:24,759
- You sure about this?
- Go fix your family.

580
00:40:32,969 --> 00:40:35,319
Why didn't you tell me about your kid?

581
00:40:36,754 --> 00:40:38,515
I didn't know what to say.

582
00:40:39,901 --> 00:40:41,028
Still don't.

583
00:41:30,969 --> 00:41:33,094
- Where's Ope?
- Kid got hurt.

584
00:41:33,517 --> 00:41:35,517
Had to take her to the hospital.

585
00:41:35,637 --> 00:41:37,719
Got the bag. I can make it work.

586
00:41:40,321 --> 00:41:41,793
It's all good, brother.

587
00:42:21,978 --> 00:42:24,456
- How does that sound?
- That was good.

588
00:42:31,036 --> 00:42:32,879
That was beautiful, babe.

589
00:42:33,396 --> 00:42:34,911
It's "All Shook Up."

590
00:42:38,272 --> 00:42:40,560
Bobby, Jesus, what are you doing here?

591
00:42:40,721 --> 00:42:42,968
- Simon, what the hell is that?
- I'm booked.

592
00:42:43,088 --> 00:42:45,023
Tonight, tomorrow, five shows.

593
00:42:45,185 --> 00:42:46,652
I got a new girl in booking.

594
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,151
Dumb bitch doubled up my acts.

595
00:42:48,312 --> 00:42:50,279
Well, goddamn it, Simon.

596
00:42:50,399 --> 00:42:52,654
Just tell Chun King to take a hike.

597
00:42:52,774 --> 00:42:55,283
I got six busloads of Korean tourists
coming in.

598
00:42:55,543 --> 00:42:56,743
They love Asian Elvis.

599
00:42:57,087 --> 00:42:59,137
I'll get you next month, Bobby.

600
00:43:00,399 --> 00:43:02,349
Better luck next time, bubba.

601
00:43:03,716 --> 00:43:04,608
Thank you.

602
00:43:04,728 --> 00:43:06,217
Thank you very much.

603
00:43:50,803 --> 00:43:51,803
Who is it?

604
00:43:53,053 --> 00:43:54,133
The Colonel.

605
00:43:56,749 --> 00:43:58,087
Oh, sweet Jesus!

606
00:44:01,727 --> 00:44:04,353
Oh, Mama, help me!
Oh, sweet Jesus!

607
00:44:10,323 --> 00:44:12,542
Praise Jesus, it's a miracle.

608
00:44:13,223 --> 00:44:15,217
I've got the rest over here.

609
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:16,865
Get the guns in the van.

610
00:44:17,933 --> 00:44:19,483
Wire this shithole up.

611
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:43,062
Shit.

612
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:46,748
- What the hell is the problem?
- Nothing.

613
00:44:46,868 --> 00:44:48,841
Just got to check something with Ope.

614
00:44:48,961 --> 00:44:50,297
Guns are loaded.

615
00:44:50,967 --> 00:44:52,070
What's the holdup?

616
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,491
We got company.

617
00:44:57,002 --> 00:44:58,999
- Got to be the Mayans.
- Yeah.

618
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,452
Get the van out of sight. Lay low.

619
00:45:01,931 --> 00:45:03,307
You... with me.

620
00:45:11,931 --> 00:45:12,931
Open it.

621
00:45:14,399 --> 00:45:16,231
Check the electric panel.

622
00:45:16,924 --> 00:45:17,933
Okay, man.

623
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:28,639
Shit.

624
00:45:29,369 --> 00:45:30,955
Should have been long gone by now.

625
00:45:31,075 --> 00:45:33,687
We got the iron.
Let's get the hell out of here.

626
00:45:33,807 --> 00:45:35,485
I came to send a message.

627
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:37,945
Those two wetbacks see
that busted back door,

628
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:40,088
they'll call for backup.

629
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:43,167
Blowing up shit's one thing.

630
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:45,876
We off these guys, could trigger
something runs out of control.

631
00:45:45,996 --> 00:45:48,046
That's the cost of your mistake.

632
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,333
You got a problem making it right?

633
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:56,954
I'll draw 'em to the Dumpster.

634
00:46:17,563 --> 00:46:18,824
Tell your dirtbag buddies,

635
00:46:18,944 --> 00:46:21,519
they camp out here,
they get some of this.

636
00:46:25,745 --> 00:46:27,729
No, bang, bang, <i>por favor</i>.

637
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,168
You tell your dirtbag buddies,

638
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:36,130
they steal from Sam Crow,

639
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,896
they get some of this.

640
00:46:43,813 --> 00:46:44,763
I got him.

641
00:46:57,733 --> 00:46:58,743
Holy shit.

642
00:47:01,274 --> 00:47:02,613
Go check the back.

643
00:47:02,775 --> 00:47:04,115
Make sure that's all of them.

644
00:47:10,811 --> 00:47:12,061
He's all yours.

645
00:47:15,764 --> 00:47:16,753
BP's dropping.

646
00:47:19,205 --> 00:47:20,715
- Get the paddles.
- Charging.

647
00:47:24,373 --> 00:47:25,373
Keep clear.

648
00:47:26,799 --> 00:47:28,049
Check the leads.

649
00:47:28,384 --> 00:47:30,385
Prepare to massage the heart.

650
00:47:57,652 --> 00:47:58,862
I'm all right.

651
00:47:59,754 --> 00:48:00,904
Got the vest.

652
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,877
Finish it.

653
00:48:24,921 --> 00:48:26,083
It's finished.

654
00:48:27,692 --> 00:48:30,087
Mary, Mother of Christ!

655
00:48:30,529 --> 00:48:33,233
I leave you bad boys for two minutes,

656
00:48:33,574 --> 00:48:35,324
and it all turns to shit!

657
00:48:36,298 --> 00:48:37,625
We're all good.

658
00:48:38,328 --> 00:48:40,592
- Let's get out of here.
- Clay.

659
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:41,970
Look at this.

660
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:50,054
Darby's guy.

661
00:48:50,174 --> 00:48:52,266
Looks like Darby did make
some new friends in Chino.

662
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:55,101
White boy must've sucked
lots of brown dick.

663
00:48:55,444 --> 00:48:57,323
Nords crew up with the Mayans,

664
00:48:57,443 --> 00:48:59,593
gives 'em numbers, access to guns.

665
00:48:59,713 --> 00:49:01,761
And a common enemy: us.

666
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:04,180
Darby wants Charming.

667
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:11,325
There goes the neighborhood.

668
00:49:27,074 --> 00:49:28,457
Sinus rhythm's back.

669
00:49:31,043 --> 00:49:32,652
O2 sats are coming up.

670
00:49:42,966 --> 00:49:44,598
Candle's in the cake.

671
00:49:45,267 --> 00:49:46,194
Let's go home.

672
00:50:46,749 --> 00:50:50,131
Looks like the boy might
actually see his first birthday.

673
00:50:50,369 --> 00:50:51,218
He made it?

674
00:50:52,577 --> 00:50:54,079
Oh, Abel, thank God!

675
00:50:56,076 --> 00:50:57,356
Thank you, God.

676
00:51:01,372 --> 00:51:02,398
Maybe...

677
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:04,272
we should say a little prayer.

678
00:51:06,972 --> 00:51:08,847
Okay. That'd be good.

679
00:51:09,904 --> 00:51:10,696
Dear God,

680
00:51:11,644 --> 00:51:13,694
thank you for saving this boy...

681
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:17,348
From his murderous junkie mom,

682
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:22,160
who cared more about a $40 rush
than she did her own flesh and blood.

683
00:51:22,627 --> 00:51:24,917
- Don't you dare...
- Don't I dare?

684
00:51:25,078 --> 00:51:26,794
You pathetic whore.

685
00:51:26,955 --> 00:51:29,714
Guess the D.A.
was impressed with your Bible studies.

686
00:51:29,876 --> 00:51:32,226
Hear they're not gonna press charges.

687
00:51:32,482 --> 00:51:35,279
When I check out of here,
I'm going into Promises.

688
00:51:35,399 --> 00:51:38,249
Let's just throw money
at those 12-step freaks.

689
00:51:38,881 --> 00:51:40,842
How long is it gonna last this time?

690
00:51:40,962 --> 00:51:41,962
Six months?

691
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:44,102
Three?
Couple of weeks?

692
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:47,481
It's gonna be different this time.
This time I have my baby to live for.

693
00:51:48,575 --> 00:51:50,398
That's where you're wrong.

694
00:51:52,153 --> 00:51:53,363
You have no baby.

695
00:51:53,668 --> 00:51:55,031
You lost that privilege.

696
00:51:58,635 --> 00:51:59,788
You so much

697
00:52:00,238 --> 00:52:02,246
as cast a shadow on that kid,

698
00:52:02,663 --> 00:52:05,513
try to turn some legal screw
and get custody...

699
00:52:06,977 --> 00:52:08,461
I will finish this job.

700
00:52:10,038 --> 00:52:11,294
He will never...

701
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,008
call you Mommy.

702
00:52:19,476 --> 00:52:21,098
I suggest you turn to Jesus.

703
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:53,783
Is he gonna be okay?

704
