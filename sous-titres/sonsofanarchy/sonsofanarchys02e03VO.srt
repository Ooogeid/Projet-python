2
00:00:02,778 --> 00:00:06,093
Feds raided Luann's studio.
Asset seizure. Wiped her out.

3
00:00:06,218 --> 00:00:09,884
She needs time and money
to get up and running in a new space.

4
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:11,677
Your new studio.

5
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,846
- Sam Crow as a partner?
- 50/50.

6
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:16,140
I'd like you to meet Ethan Zobelle.

7
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,309
- AJ Weston.
- I know who you are.

8
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,603
White hate.
The hell do you want from me?

9
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:24,023
We just want you to know
that we are at your disposal

10
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,567
- if you need us.
- This is $5,000.

11
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:28,569
Should get you operational
inside Charming.

12
00:00:28,822 --> 00:00:29,737
Who are you?

13
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:31,739
Just dropping by to give you
a friendly advice.

14
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:33,793
We feel it would be best
for all concerned

15
00:00:33,918 --> 00:00:37,078
if you stopped dealing arms
to the One-Niners and the Mayans.

16
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:40,498
- You're done selling guns to color.
- Nobody threatens Sam Crow.

17
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:42,500
- Who the hell's that?
- Friend of Darby's.

18
00:00:42,669 --> 00:00:44,319
Nothing to worry about.

19
00:00:44,637 --> 00:00:47,088
My baby swallowed something.
He's choking. Please help me.

20
00:00:51,695 --> 00:00:54,230
I need you to pass on
a message to your old man.

21
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:56,889
Tell him to stop selling guns
to niggers and wetbacks

22
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:59,358
or we find you and we do this again.

23
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:03,078
Oh, my god.

24
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:04,751
Get me out of here.

25
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:07,467
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

26
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:09,610
- We got to tell Clay.
- Not Clay,

27
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:10,653
not Jax.

28
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,090
No one.

29
00:02:19,665 --> 00:02:21,432
You're a bad boss, Mr. Draper.

30
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,353
Just like that.

31
00:02:28,285 --> 00:02:29,385
Yeah, mommy.

32
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:33,350
- Harder. Harder!
- All right.

33
00:02:33,475 --> 00:02:34,825
Big finish, Lyla.

34
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,405
Oh God.

35
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:42,203
Cut!

36
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:43,684
Check it!

37
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:48,435

FIX

50
00:03:38,747 --> 00:03:40,397
Come to bed last night?

51
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,884
I can't get comfortable.

52
00:03:44,464 --> 00:03:46,350
I didn't want to keep you up.

53
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:50,358
I'd rather you tossed next to me
than on the couch.

54
00:03:55,798 --> 00:03:56,798
This is...

55
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,280
starting to become a habit.

56
00:04:01,123 --> 00:04:02,992
It's been, like,
three weeks since...

57
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,960
I still got a lot of pain.

58
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:08,366
Then you should go see the doc.

59
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:10,669
I don't need meds.

60
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:12,167
Just need some time.

61
00:04:12,624 --> 00:04:13,824
How much time?

62
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:21,844
I got to get to the office.

63
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:24,346
- I just sat down.
- I'm late.

64
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:27,224
List of repos came in
from the dealer last night.

65
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:31,391
- I'm trying to talk to you here.
- Since when do you want to talk?

66
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:48,674
What is it?

67
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,122
Nothing.

68
00:04:51,482 --> 00:04:54,932
I had to get some air in my tires.
I figured I'd check in.

69
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:57,310
I'm fine.

70
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:00,502
Your face is healing.

71
00:05:00,627 --> 00:05:01,877
Pretty as ever.

72
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:04,268
Thank you, Chief.

73
00:05:09,562 --> 00:05:10,643
Something else?

74
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:14,248
I've been going to these meetings.

75
00:05:14,373 --> 00:05:15,823
St. Luke's in Lodi.

76
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:17,667
Cancer survivors.

77
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,650
- Support group?
- I got to say,

78
00:05:21,062 --> 00:05:22,812
it's making a difference.

79
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,282
You going somewhere with this?

80
00:05:31,503 --> 00:05:34,338
I saw on the board,
church got a group for victims

81
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:36,210
of sexual assault crimes.

82
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,729
It's out of Charming.

83
00:05:39,703 --> 00:05:42,103
- Anonymous.
- How long you known me?

84
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:47,115
You really think that I'm the type
of gal that joins some holy,

85
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:49,007
poor-me circle-jerk?

86
00:05:50,318 --> 00:05:51,568
Just a thought.

87
00:05:53,707 --> 00:05:54,693
You take care.

88
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:05,292
- Morning, beaut...
- Oh, shit.

89
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:08,584
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

90
00:06:09,364 --> 00:06:11,101
Here's the repo list.

91
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:13,436
Why don't you get half-sack
and Opie started on it?

92
00:06:13,561 --> 00:06:14,611
Yeah, sure.

93
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:28,189
Sad Elvis.

94
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:30,019
Blow me.

95
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,490
Goddamn Bar Mitzvahs are killing me.

96
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,140
Why you doing it, then?

97
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,397
Tahoe gigs will come back around.

98
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:39,801
I'm buried.

99
00:06:40,936 --> 00:06:44,073
Inside for two months,
child support, alimony.

100
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,640
My oldest needs oral surgery.

101
00:06:48,765 --> 00:06:52,286
They got to cut his frenum.
What the hell is a frenum?

102
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,767
Sounds Jewish.

103
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:55,470
Sounds expensive.

104
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:05,126
You're no use to us in the garage
with that shoulder.

105
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:07,801
Why don't you take point up
at Caracara?

106
00:07:08,438 --> 00:07:09,438
Porn.

107
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,555
I need a set of eyes up there
I can trust.

108
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:15,039
I don't want it to turn
into a goddamn Bukaki fest.

109
00:07:15,316 --> 00:07:17,866
Run the books,
keep everybody zipped up.

110
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:20,459
Take a salary.

111
00:07:21,784 --> 00:07:22,784
Whose end?

112
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:24,529
Not ours.

113
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,983
Luann is going to shit.

114
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:32,034
Better things coming out of her ass
then getting jammed back in it, huh?

115
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,070
All right.

116
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,690
Homework?

117
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:52,053
The Jungle?

118
00:07:54,813 --> 00:07:55,913
You know it?

119
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,394
Almost turned me vegan.

120
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:02,686
This is...

121
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:06,388
really twisted,
but I'm actually craving a big steak.

122
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:11,448
I got a porterhouse
right here for you, baby.

123
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,976
You're a class act, Teller.

124
00:08:16,836 --> 00:08:18,086
Give me a kiss.

125
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:34,316
Here?

126
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:36,326
Just us carnivores.

127
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,333
It's you.

128
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,696
- Shit.
- Porn hotline.

129
00:08:56,795 --> 00:08:58,395
<i>How are you Jacky boy?</i>

130
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:01,756
You better get over here, brother.

131
00:09:01,881 --> 00:09:03,755
- <i>Why?</i>
- Bobby turned up,

132
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,044
told Luann he's handling
her books and shit.

133
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,313
He did what?

134
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:10,966
- Who told him to do that?
- <i>Clay, I guess.</i>

135
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,398
And Luann is freaking out.

136
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:14,934
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

137
00:09:15,532 --> 00:09:16,388
<i>All right.</i>

138
00:09:18,872 --> 00:09:20,322
Chlamydia outbreak?

139
00:09:21,382 --> 00:09:22,382
I'm sorry.

140
00:09:23,754 --> 00:09:25,354
I'll drop you at home.

141
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:27,399
Take me.

142
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:29,379
Yeah?

143
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:32,362
Maybe we can still salvage the day.

144
00:09:39,818 --> 00:09:40,868
More repos.

145
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:45,106
Where the hell's Gemma going?

146
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:48,295
Caracara. I guess Luann's
having some kind of a meltdown.

147
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,864
Stupid bitch.

148
00:09:51,464 --> 00:09:53,217
I hate it when mommy
and daddy fight.

149
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:56,946
Get to work, shithead.

150
00:09:59,213 --> 00:10:00,766
Pretty sure he was talking to you.

151
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,336
Where are you going?

152
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:06,761
To protect Clay.

153
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,975
Clay Morrow and your boss
with Laroy Wayne,

154
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:16,726
runs the One-Niners,

155
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:20,051
controls the largest heroine trade
in three counties.

156
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:24,414
- That's nothing I don't already know.
- It's something to act on, Deputy.

157
00:10:24,662 --> 00:10:27,844
Chief of police associating
with drug kingpins?

158
00:10:27,969 --> 00:10:29,836
Unser's done in six weeks.

159
00:10:30,006 --> 00:10:32,589
And you'll be no better off
than you are now.

160
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,816
Sam Crow will continue to vex.

161
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,928
- That's my problem.
- It's a difficult one.

162
00:10:38,128 --> 00:10:40,528
Charming treats
the Sons like heroes.

163
00:10:41,634 --> 00:10:42,634
Some do.

164
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:48,056
You know, I can help you.

165
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,117
And how are you gonna do that?

166
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:56,690
Clay vows to keep Charming
safe and drug-free.

167
00:10:56,815 --> 00:10:58,915
That's why folks embrace the MC.

168
00:10:59,128 --> 00:11:01,555
What happens to public opinion

169
00:11:01,942 --> 00:11:03,442
if he can't do that?

170
00:11:04,255 --> 00:11:06,565
If drugs land in Charming,
that's on me.

171
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,840
It's on Unser

172
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:11,055
and Sam Crow is knocked off
their iconic pedestal.

173
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:12,942
Then when you take over,

174
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:14,467
the drugs go away.

175
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:20,697
Are you talking about deliberately
bringing drugs into my town?

176
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:24,428
I'm talking about creating
a temporary problem

177
00:11:24,857 --> 00:11:27,861
that allows you to flush out
the permanent one.

178
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:32,956
... head on over there, okay!

179
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:36,278
Sorry, I didn't know
you had a visitor.

180
00:11:36,753 --> 00:11:39,203
Deputy Chief,
thank you for your time.

181
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:42,951
- Ain't anybody gonna introduce?
- Ethan Zobelle,

182
00:11:43,457 --> 00:11:45,094
Impeccable Smokes.

183
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:46,491
Cigar king.

184
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:48,716
That's right.

185
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:50,245
Gentlemen.

186
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:21,546
I'll wait.

187
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:23,468
Five minutes.

188
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,613
- This is bullshit!
- All right.

189
00:12:36,738 --> 00:12:39,442
A manager? I'm getting shut out
of my own business.

190
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:42,135
I'm just here to do the bookkeeping,
darling.

191
00:12:43,006 --> 00:12:44,756
Did you sign off on this?

192
00:12:47,123 --> 00:12:48,818
It was a club decision.

193
00:12:48,943 --> 00:12:50,434
Like I need this hassle.

194
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,940
I gotta finish this shoot,

195
00:12:52,065 --> 00:12:54,612
post an anal rain dance
and prep a sorority swing.

196
00:12:54,737 --> 00:12:56,018
Look at it this way,

197
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:59,277
Bobby handling the admin frees you up
to do all the important shit.

198
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:02,999
What's an anal rain dance?

199
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,294
Shouldn't you be polishing that bike,
sweetie?

200
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,363
Jax likes it nice and shiny.

201
00:13:27,024 --> 00:13:29,681
Where the hell you been, Ima?
This is your movie.

202
00:13:29,806 --> 00:13:31,826
I've been shooting
around your shit all morning.

203
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:32,978
Look, I'm sorry.

204
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:35,599
I had to detour, okay.
I think Georgie's following me.

205
00:13:35,724 --> 00:13:37,507
Some goon
almost ran me off the road.

206
00:13:37,632 --> 00:13:40,256
Nah, relax, darling.
We took care of that.

207
00:13:40,381 --> 00:13:41,903
Georgie ain't that stupid.

208
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,422
Georgie's psycho.

209
00:13:43,547 --> 00:13:44,882
What he did to Lyla,

210
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:46,407
he could do to me.

211
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:48,702
I want Jax protecting me.

212
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:52,393
You know how easily
I dry out under stress.

213
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,570
Look,

214
00:14:01,695 --> 00:14:03,495
she's got a thing for you.

215
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:05,366
So, just play along,

216
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:06,803
calm her down.

217
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,121
She's our biggest draw right now.

218
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,968
You got no reason to be scared,
darling.

219
00:14:16,093 --> 00:14:18,156
We're here to keep you safe.

220
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,442
I don't know why I'm so freaked out,
I just...

221
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,282
I was terrified.

222
00:14:36,194 --> 00:14:38,072
What the hell you doing here?

223
00:14:38,197 --> 00:14:40,347
Luann called. She's freaking out.

224
00:14:41,383 --> 00:14:44,072
That's club business.
You got no reason to intervene.

225
00:14:44,197 --> 00:14:45,569
What... intervene?

226
00:14:45,694 --> 00:14:47,757
She's my friend. She needs to talk.

227
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:50,388
So when she wants to talk, you what,
drop everything?

228
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,225
- Jesus Christ, what are you, three?
- Get back to the garage.

229
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:54,835
Excuse me?

230
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,855
The last thing I need is for you
running diva over a goddamn cum factory.

231
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:00,134
Asshole.

232
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,175
You stupid piece of shit!

233
00:15:20,682 --> 00:15:23,255
Give me a call when you get finished.
I'll make sure you get home safe.

234
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,216
He's occupied, honey. You should
wait outside like you were told.

235
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,886
Okay, I'm sorry.

236
00:15:28,072 --> 00:15:31,572
- She's a little out of her mind.
- She's not the only one.

237
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,976
Just what those arthritic mitts need,
a good pounding.

238
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,578
You want to see a good pounding?

239
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,188
Come on, bad ass, lay hands on me.

240
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,357
I'll slit your goddamn throat!

241
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:43,859
You are pathetic!

242
00:15:46,401 --> 00:15:47,846
Don't you touch...

243
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:49,906
Don't!

244
00:16:04,376 --> 00:16:05,776
I hate doing this.

245
00:16:07,494 --> 00:16:10,144
Recession's bad on payments,
good on repo.

246
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:14,644
Jesus Christ.

247
00:16:16,511 --> 00:16:17,511
What?

248
00:16:17,636 --> 00:16:19,197
That shithead's dealing.

249
00:16:19,322 --> 00:16:21,372
Looks like one of Darby's guys.

250
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:37,055
You got a need?

251
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,290
- To take your shit somewhere else.
- No one deals in Charming.

252
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:42,881
I ain't no one.

253
00:16:45,953 --> 00:16:46,953
Aryans.

254
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:48,816
Shit.

255
00:16:54,197 --> 00:16:56,885
I'm pretty good with a crowbar
but I can't deflect bullets.

256
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,433
Let's get some backup.

257
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:12,614
- What do you got?
- Zobelle's a goddamn saint.

258
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:15,299
He owns five cigar shops,
deacon at his church,

259
00:17:15,424 --> 00:17:17,535
- widower, one kid.
- But look at this.

260
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,573
Last place
the League of American Nationalists

261
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:21,454
put down roots was San Bernardino.

262
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:24,225
Six months later,
war boys MC crumbled.

263
00:17:24,761 --> 00:17:27,328
Entire crew went away
for aggravated assault,

264
00:17:27,453 --> 00:17:29,453
attacked Zobelle's cigar shop.

265
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,508
War boys run guns.

266
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,290
- They did.
- Why would Zobelle care about guns?

267
00:17:34,415 --> 00:17:35,720
'cause these dickheads

268
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,889
are prepping for the great race war.

269
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,952
Zobelle came at us hard.

270
00:17:40,324 --> 00:17:41,924
Cocky threat. No fear.

271
00:17:42,248 --> 00:17:43,948
He wanted to incite you.

272
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,438
So, what?

273
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:48,566
- We own the law in Charming.
- Unser, not Hale.

274
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,100
Maybe you got Hale.

275
00:17:50,225 --> 00:17:52,612
If Hale could be bought,
we'd have him.

276
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,581
Maybe we never offered him
the right pay off.

277
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,742
Let's stick with the devil we know.

278
00:17:58,047 --> 00:18:01,137
Darby's Lodi cook shops are all
shuttered up. Maybe he's gone mobile.

279
00:18:01,262 --> 00:18:04,036
Let's find those meth labs, okay?
And now!

280
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:07,919
Ima called.

281
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,213
Miss double penetration
is ready for you.

282
00:18:14,197 --> 00:18:16,250
I'll be right back.
Just gotta give her a safe ride.

283
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,021
A producer's work
is never done, huh?

284
00:18:20,603 --> 00:18:24,102
Should've given me a heads up
about Bobby taking over Luann's books.

285
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:28,023
I brought this to the club.
It's my action.

286
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:29,482
Bobby needs it.

287
00:18:29,889 --> 00:18:31,568
He did two months inside for us.

288
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,448
Maybe it's time you start thinking
about something other than yourself.

289
00:18:47,253 --> 00:18:48,253
Hey, bro.

290
00:18:50,012 --> 00:18:51,262
How's it going?

291
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:55,835
I thought this was gonna be a cush gig
but Luann's accounts are a mess.

292
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,304
Missing receivables.
Vendor files.

293
00:18:59,811 --> 00:19:02,557
Guess her expertise
lies in other areas.

294
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:06,383
You okay with this?

295
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,605
I know Clay
made the call without you.

296
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:10,988
It's good.

297
00:19:11,223 --> 00:19:12,442
It's good you're here.

298
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,750
I know I can be of some help.

299
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,475
I don't know what kind
of system she had.

300
00:19:18,731 --> 00:19:20,742
Let me know if you need anything.

301
00:19:30,745 --> 00:19:31,836
You and Clay.

302
00:19:32,946 --> 00:19:34,815
The guys are worried.

303
00:19:36,224 --> 00:19:38,009
Got nothing to worry about.

304
00:19:38,932 --> 00:19:40,032
Convince me.

305
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,248
You talk to Clay?

306
00:19:53,614 --> 00:19:55,819
Just father-son shit, you know.

307
00:19:56,722 --> 00:19:58,279
We'll work it out.

308
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:00,298
It's all good.

309
00:20:04,923 --> 00:20:05,923
I'm ready.

310
00:20:06,396 --> 00:20:07,496
She's ready.

311
00:20:08,138 --> 00:20:09,188
I got that.

312
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:21,636
- You got a need, brother?
- You got a 40 bag?

313
00:20:22,606 --> 00:20:23,913
Relax, relax.

314
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,191
My foreman sees me,
I'm screwed, man.

315
00:20:27,316 --> 00:20:28,866
Over here, over here.

316
00:20:30,966 --> 00:20:33,373
This ain't that Mexican shit, right?

317
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,598
I'm all about "Made in America."

318
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:42,797
Where's Darby cooking the crank?

319
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:48,496
Let's see what his balls
are made out of, glass or steel?

320
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:52,810
Charming.

321
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:56,491
Water Road, out by the streams.
Shitty red house.

322
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:07,713
Thirsty?

323
00:21:07,838 --> 00:21:09,100
HIV test.

324
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,374
You're due.

325
00:21:24,306 --> 00:21:27,035
- I haven't had sex since it happened.
- Make sense.

326
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,254
You're still healing.

327
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:31,670
Pussy's not the problem.

328
00:21:32,348 --> 00:21:33,389
It's my head.

329
00:21:33,514 --> 00:21:35,864
- You need time.
- I need something.

330
00:21:39,116 --> 00:21:40,667
Where's Clay with all this?

331
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:43,084
Did you miss the car show earlier?

332
00:21:43,755 --> 00:21:45,887
- He hates me.
- That's not true.

333
00:21:46,988 --> 00:21:48,348
I don't know.

334
00:22:01,484 --> 00:22:02,987
Son of a bitch.

335
00:22:03,237 --> 00:22:04,489
Thanks again, Jax.

336
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:08,151
I know I'm probably just overreacting,
but you know.

337
00:22:08,437 --> 00:22:10,087
It's all good, darling.

338
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,006
I'll see you tonight, okay?
Wrap party.

339
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:27,428
You good with that rubbing on Jax?

340
00:22:28,908 --> 00:22:30,008
I trust him.

341
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,218
It's not him you worry about.

342
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:35,772
It's them.

343
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:37,272
They think he's a free dick.

344
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,040
You gotta educate.

345
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,442
Set the bitch straight.

346
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,569
The others see it, everyone knows.

347
00:22:45,724 --> 00:22:48,724
- What, like, hit her?
- Kick, scratch, whatever.

348
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,974
I'm not 18 years old anymore.
My catfighting days are behind me.

349
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:57,608
We'll see.

350
00:22:58,986 --> 00:22:59,919
My pee.

351
00:23:01,234 --> 00:23:02,234
Thanks.

352
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,565
Dealer said Darby's cooking
down by the streams.

353
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,741
I know that part of Water Road.
Only a few houses.

354
00:23:17,484 --> 00:23:19,084
We find the right one,

355
00:23:19,673 --> 00:23:20,565
clear it out,

356
00:23:21,072 --> 00:23:22,222
burn it down.

357
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:26,399
You talking about blowing
something up in our backyard.

358
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,242
That's exposure, Clay.

359
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:30,265
Don't see another way, brother.

360
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,248
Why don't we just tell Unser?

361
00:23:32,373 --> 00:23:34,268
Let the cops actually
do their job for once.

362
00:23:34,393 --> 00:23:35,765
Doesn't send a message.

363
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,042
Zobelle's not a gangster. We don't
know what kind of message to send.

364
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,442
All right.

365
00:23:42,795 --> 00:23:44,854
We let the cops handle it.

366
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:47,530
Only we don't tell Unser.

367
00:23:47,942 --> 00:23:49,135
We tell Hale.

368
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:52,835
If he buries the intel,
we know he's on Zobelle's payroll.

369
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,510
I'm telling you, man,

370
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:56,726
Hale's not working for white power.

371
00:23:56,894 --> 00:24:00,494
- So he shuts down the cook shop.
- And if he doesn't, we do.

372
00:24:01,168 --> 00:24:02,231
All in favor?

373
00:24:05,915 --> 00:24:06,916
Sure.

374
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:15,669
You waiting for me?

375
00:24:17,252 --> 00:24:19,165
Nords are dealing in town.

376
00:24:19,485 --> 00:24:23,294
Found out where Darby's cooker is.
Water Road, out by the streams.

377
00:24:24,743 --> 00:24:25,843
In Charming?

378
00:24:27,825 --> 00:24:31,068
Red house.
Shouldn't be hard to find.

379
00:24:33,135 --> 00:24:35,264
So now you're doing my job, too?

380
00:24:35,648 --> 00:24:37,314
I'm telling you,
we don't nip this now,

381
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:39,393
Nords are gonna flood
that mill with crank.

382
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:42,374
I'm not jerking you around, man.

383
00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:45,109
I convinced Clay
to let you guys handle it.

384
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,276
Do it by the book for a change.

385
00:24:50,162 --> 00:24:52,662
Okay.
Well, I'll take a ride out there.

386
00:25:01,815 --> 00:25:03,465
What's so urgent, pres?

387
00:25:03,741 --> 00:25:05,294
Darby's dealing in Charming.

388
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:10,517
You're kidding me.
Is he smoking his own shit?

389
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:13,469
The Nords are running
proxy for a bigger player.

390
00:25:14,163 --> 00:25:17,213
- I'm listening.
- You been approached by anybody?

391
00:25:19,205 --> 00:25:20,505
What about Hale?

392
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,588
He met with somebody earlier.

393
00:25:23,846 --> 00:25:25,982
- A friend of his brother.
- Ethan Zobelle?

394
00:25:28,238 --> 00:25:29,388
That's right.

395
00:25:30,077 --> 00:25:31,395
Cigar guy.

396
00:25:32,145 --> 00:25:33,472
He's the player?

397
00:25:34,473 --> 00:25:35,933
He's part of a separatist group.

398
00:25:36,058 --> 00:25:38,494
The suit and tie is just
cover for white power.

399
00:25:40,077 --> 00:25:43,523
You think Hale's cheek
dancing with this scumbag?

400
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:46,627
A little out of character.

401
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,462
What's Hale want more than anything?

402
00:25:49,108 --> 00:25:50,381
Hurt Sam Crow.

403
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,149
How does he do that,
if not with the law?

404
00:25:56,162 --> 00:25:59,162
We fed him some intel
on where Darby's cooker is.

405
00:25:59,802 --> 00:26:02,925
If he's in Zobelle's pocket,
he'll bury it.

406
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:07,241
Keep an eye on him.

407
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,112
Help you, officer?

408
00:26:30,663 --> 00:26:34,263
- What the hell you doing out here?
- It's my little retreat.

409
00:26:34,735 --> 00:26:35,735
Hunting,

410
00:26:36,509 --> 00:26:37,303
fishing.

411
00:26:38,283 --> 00:26:40,431
You need industrial
filters to cook fish?

412
00:26:42,337 --> 00:26:43,601
You got a warrant?

413
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:47,881
Not yet.

414
00:27:05,647 --> 00:27:07,097
From Ethan Zobelle.

415
00:27:15,674 --> 00:27:17,093
Grand opening coupon.

416
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:20,104
See you there.

417
00:27:37,378 --> 00:27:39,240
You already had Darby cooking meth.

418
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,319
I'm not responsible for Mr. Darby.

419
00:27:42,444 --> 00:27:45,538
That your temporary problem,
flooding the mill with crank?

420
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:49,237
- Did you arrest him?
- I didn't have a warrant.

421
00:27:49,362 --> 00:27:50,412
So get one.

422
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:56,650
Maybe I'll pick up one for you, too.

423
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:02,379
I understand your anger.

424
00:28:03,525 --> 00:28:07,457
And I know you think
I'm some kind of devil.

425
00:28:10,894 --> 00:28:12,528
For years,

426
00:28:14,153 --> 00:28:17,332
I sat back and watched everything
I love about this country

427
00:28:17,457 --> 00:28:19,157
slowly unravel: faith...

428
00:28:19,555 --> 00:28:21,988
Values... Morals...

429
00:28:22,444 --> 00:28:23,444
Decency.

430
00:28:25,352 --> 00:28:26,558
It culminated

431
00:28:26,683 --> 00:28:30,249
two years ago when my wife
was killed in a drive-by.

432
00:28:30,691 --> 00:28:34,669
Her blood got me off
the sidelines and into the game.

433
00:28:34,794 --> 00:28:37,279
Now if that makes me a vigilante,

434
00:28:37,404 --> 00:28:40,319
a machiavellian fool, so be it.

435
00:28:41,932 --> 00:28:44,106
I despise drugs.

436
00:28:44,532 --> 00:28:47,305
It's the last thing I would
ever wish for Charming.

437
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,890
But we both know

438
00:28:49,015 --> 00:28:51,241
your methods for

439
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,555
extracting the Sons of Anarchy
have failed.

440
00:28:56,514 --> 00:28:59,058
Because they operate
outside the law.

441
00:28:59,793 --> 00:29:03,743
If you're going to damage them,
you have to dip into their cesspool.

442
00:29:04,253 --> 00:29:05,253
It's ugly,

443
00:29:06,128 --> 00:29:07,720
it'll feel bad,

444
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:12,041
but the result will be
the salvation of Charming.

445
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,436
I'm on your side, David.

446
00:29:21,316 --> 00:29:22,466
On your side.

447
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,213
That info on the lab, that's bogus.

448
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,432
There's nothing out there.

449
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,758
Get the boom.

450
00:30:19,971 --> 00:30:21,672
You pulling me off
the set doesn't...

451
00:30:21,797 --> 00:30:24,321
Did you know
that my old man was a bookkeeper

452
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,158
- for the mob in Reno?
- Jesus Christ.

453
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:30,595
- I'm in the middle...
- Italians paid him a lot of money.

454
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,871
Do you know why?

455
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,540
Handled two sets of books.

456
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,536
Twice the work, twice the risk.

457
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,680
You've been running a skim

458
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:53,767
since the very beginning.

459
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:55,561
By my calculations,

460
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:58,840
you've been cutting us
light for six years.

461
00:30:58,965 --> 00:31:01,390
Otto gavemethis business.

462
00:31:01,706 --> 00:31:03,211
Club's the reason he's in jail.

463
00:31:03,336 --> 00:31:05,686
You can justify
it however you want.

464
00:31:06,624 --> 00:31:08,224
But you stole from us.

465
00:31:13,214 --> 00:31:15,014
What do you want me to do?

466
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,917
It's a club decision now.

467
00:31:20,831 --> 00:31:21,831
Please.

468
00:31:23,043 --> 00:31:24,791
I'll pay back every dime.

469
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,919
Just take it out of my cut.

470
00:31:27,223 --> 00:31:28,677
Club gets paid back,

471
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,745
we don't break Otto's heart.

472
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,520
I don't think I can do that.

473
00:31:44,183 --> 00:31:46,337
You ever see any of my movies?

474
00:31:48,554 --> 00:31:50,157
You know what my specialty was?

475
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:51,549
Look,

476
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,339
you're Otto's old lady.

477
00:31:58,029 --> 00:31:59,929
But there's a prison clause.

478
00:32:05,117 --> 00:32:06,617
That's got to be it.

479
00:32:08,753 --> 00:32:09,753
Go.

480
00:32:11,028 --> 00:32:12,028
Hold it!

481
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,510
Cameras.

482
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:37,218
- We're set.
- We'll clear the house, then blow it.

483
00:33:32,404 --> 00:33:33,404
Clear.

484
00:33:33,823 --> 00:33:34,634
Clear.

485
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:35,759
Clear.

486
00:33:37,734 --> 00:33:38,905
Let's go, go.

487
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:50,683
Who's got the remote?

488
00:33:51,528 --> 00:33:53,028
Ope's not using one.

489
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,822
Talk to her, man.

490
00:34:52,644 --> 00:34:53,644
I'm sorry.

491
00:35:01,152 --> 00:35:02,204
Me, too.

492
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:09,602
How are the hands?

493
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:15,293
- They're both sore.
- Yeah, I bet.

494
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,160
What's going on with us?

495
00:35:22,781 --> 00:35:23,781
It's me.

496
00:35:25,259 --> 00:35:26,459
My accident...

497
00:35:27,073 --> 00:35:29,973
it just shook me up somehow.
I don't know, I...

498
00:35:31,086 --> 00:35:32,586
Just having trouble.

499
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:35,916
How do I help?

500
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,930
I'm so sorry it's
bleeding all over you.

501
00:35:46,045 --> 00:35:48,241
I'm just a little lost, baby.

502
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:05,829
I got to get this
software over to Bobby.

503
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:09,636
I'll run it up there.

504
00:36:10,662 --> 00:36:13,362
I don't want you hanging
around that place.

505
00:36:13,565 --> 00:36:14,565
Okay.

506
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,286
There's a wrap party tonight.

507
00:36:21,915 --> 00:36:24,166
The guys are going to be there.

508
00:36:24,813 --> 00:36:26,809
I'm thinking of going.

509
00:36:30,214 --> 00:36:31,793
Unless...

510
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:37,673
You want to maybe grab
some supper or something.

511
00:36:45,457 --> 00:36:47,215
I got to relieve Neeta.

512
00:36:49,592 --> 00:36:50,982
You should go.

513
00:36:55,405 --> 00:36:56,405
Okay.

514
00:37:19,713 --> 00:37:21,055
What do we know?

515
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,603
It's a meth lab.

516
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,767
Somebody got sloppy
with the cooking.

517
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:29,538
Everybody got out.
There's no bodies.

518
00:37:30,395 --> 00:37:33,445
I guessing this has got
to be Darby's crew, right?

519
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,726
You got wind of anything?

520
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:38,059
No, nothing.

521
00:37:44,531 --> 00:37:46,431
Nothing makes sense anymore.

522
00:38:15,274 --> 00:38:18,624
- You okay there, young fella?
- I'm just a little sore.

523
00:38:19,115 --> 00:38:21,933
Guess I'm not used
to sitting behind a desk.

524
00:38:28,163 --> 00:38:29,163
Thanks.

525
00:38:31,797 --> 00:38:32,942
Crazy, huh?

526
00:38:40,802 --> 00:38:43,820
Heard you went a little cowboy
at that Mayan thing a few weeks ago.

527
00:38:45,225 --> 00:38:47,675
The thing today
with the explosives...

528
00:38:49,483 --> 00:38:51,370
I don't have a death wish, man.

529
00:38:51,836 --> 00:38:53,497
You got something going on.

530
00:38:54,989 --> 00:38:56,389
I've got the club.

531
00:38:56,859 --> 00:38:58,809
Just throwing myself into it.

532
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:01,463
You got kids, Ope.

533
00:39:01,732 --> 00:39:03,682
Don't throw yourself too far.

534
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,478
This is a closed party.

535
00:39:18,004 --> 00:39:19,504
I'm looking for Jax.

536
00:39:20,968 --> 00:39:21,949
Honey,

537
00:39:22,074 --> 00:39:25,197
he's got all he can handle
tonight, don't worry.

538
00:39:26,944 --> 00:39:28,594
