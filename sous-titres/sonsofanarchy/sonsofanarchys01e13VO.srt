1
00:00:00,918 --> 00:00:02,992
Previously on Sons of Anarchy...

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:05,532
Found a box of his old shit
in a storage unit.

3
00:00:05,657 --> 00:00:08,923
There's, like, pictures and journals.
Things I never knew about him.

4
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:11,198
I don't want the ghost
of John Teller poisoning him,

5
00:00:11,323 --> 00:00:14,512
ruining everything we've built.
You've got to nail Jax down.

6
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,890
You have to nail him
down hard, Clay.

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,685
- Now what?
- Abel stays in the toaster.

8
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,396
We'll ship your ass
off to rehab... again.

9
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:25,593
I'm just saying, we should be cool
with whatever this is around her.

10
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:27,817
Because she's still
in love with you?

11
00:00:31,094 --> 00:00:34,074
I want Op pulling the trigger on this.
No mistakes.

12
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:35,076
Shit.

13
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:38,328
Munson, you're under arrest
for the murder of Hefner.

14
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,205
ATF says they got an eyewitness.

15
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,125
Only two other guys
were witness to that hit.

16
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:45,794
- Where's Ope?
- I checked Opie's finances.

17
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:48,914
Somebody paid off a huge chunk
of his debt, federal wire transfer.

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,801
I figured the least I could do

19
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,386
was pay off some
of those big bills of yours.

20
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:57,681
- You're setting me up as the rat.
- What is going to happen

21
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:00,058
when I put you
and your family back in Charming?

22
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:03,019
I'll tell the club the truth.
I know how this looks.

23
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,980
She set me up to look like a rat.
It's all a lie.

24
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,359
I don't know who the witness is,
but it sure as shit ain't me.

25
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,529
- Am I good with you, Clay?
- Yeah.

26
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:15,607
The truck, wired.
Opie has turned on us.

27
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,860
This has got to happen, Clay.

28
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,426
His death never

29
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:21,539
lands at our feet.

30
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,623
The Mayans want guns.
They want them right away.

31
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:26,543
You and Tig pick up the money.
Me and Jax drop off the guns.

32
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:29,129
David, call him.
Tell him to give them the cash.

33
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:34,009
Laroy definitely double-crossed us.

34
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:35,766
If the Niners are that pissed,

35
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:38,563
and they bring their rage
to Charming, I mean...

36
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:40,974
They saw Opie's truck
at the money drop.

37
00:01:41,157 --> 00:01:42,507
What, a drive-by?

38
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:45,341
Got to be tonight. After the party.

39
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,592
- Love you.
- Love you back.

40
00:01:47,717 --> 00:01:49,867
Make it ghetto. Make it gangster.

41
00:01:52,685 --> 00:01:53,436
Shit.

42
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:58,475
Oh, baby.

43
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:57,961
Hey, Mary.

44
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:15,397
Where is he?

45
00:03:17,623 --> 00:03:18,660
Outside.

46
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,729
With the kids.

47
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:26,871
It's good you're here, Mary.

48
00:03:58,231 --> 00:03:59,750
How are they doing?

49
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:01,906
She's been crying all morning.

50
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:04,311
Kenny still doesn't get it.

51
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:08,583
Boys.

52
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:12,034
Anything you need...

53
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:13,884
I know.

54
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,785
You want me to stick around?

55
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:26,459
I'm okay.

56
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:32,767
She knew.

57
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,443
She knew I was gonna bring
on something like this.

58
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,247
Ope, you didn't bring this.

59
00:04:40,372 --> 00:04:42,643
A banger shot my wife.

60
00:04:44,049 --> 00:04:46,093
I had nothing to do with that?

61
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,983
Can I help?

62
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:34,628
Your upset last night.

63
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:40,837
Was that our mistake?

64
00:05:46,486 --> 00:05:47,509
Jesus.

65
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:52,976
And Jax?

66
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:57,647
He knows what everybody else knows.

67
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,546
Donna's death was Niner retaliation.

68
00:06:02,634 --> 00:06:04,153
Motherless children...

69
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:09,639
They make people do drastic things.
This is bad.

70
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,390
You think I don't know that?

71
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:16,565
You think I wanted this?

72
00:06:24,774 --> 00:06:26,698
You feel all that, baby.

73
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:29,579
You feel it here.

74
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:31,743
That's right.

75
00:06:32,254 --> 00:06:33,940
You walk out that door.

76
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:37,179
You be the man
they all need you to be.

77
00:06:55,651 --> 00:06:56,658
Jesus.

78
00:07:02,383 --> 00:07:04,464
- What's this?
- Got a call from Lodi.

79
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,916
A black Rover was jacked
from a sports bar last night.

80
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,428
Take Fain,
see if anybody saw anything.

81
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:13,452
We both know
who was driving that SUV.

82
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:19,088
We got no positive ID.

83
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:26,944
This relationship
you have with Clay,

84
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:28,415
I don't like it.

85
00:07:30,787 --> 00:07:31,937
But I get it.

86
00:07:32,354 --> 00:07:34,994
You make a deal with the devil
to keep the peace.

87
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:37,316
But look at this.

88
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:41,456
Look at what we let happen.

89
00:07:43,268 --> 00:07:45,268
An innocent woman was killed.

90
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,480
I didn't let that happen.

91
00:07:49,043 --> 00:07:50,793
You're right. It's on me.

92
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:56,175
But what was I supposed to do?

93
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,479
Roll over

94
00:07:57,726 --> 00:08:00,144
and feed Sam Crow
classified information?

95
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:04,355
I get the rock and the hard place
this all took you to.

96
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:08,987
- Sorry this guilt comes down on you.
- Okay, well, then help me.

97
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,229
For once,

98
00:08:11,412 --> 00:08:12,324
please?

99
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,711
Just help me
serve justice to these guys.

100
00:08:18,964 --> 00:08:20,915
I should be fishing somewhere.

101
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,292
Or reading a book,
half-buzzed on vodka and lemonade.

102
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,168
I'm still here,
in this suit of mine,

103
00:08:26,293 --> 00:08:29,924
because I've got my own rock
and hard place I'm living between.

104
00:08:30,372 --> 00:08:32,426
I ain't got much more
of a run in me.

105
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:34,328
Few years, maybe.

106
00:08:35,755 --> 00:08:38,903
Need something to leave Della,
my half-smart kids.

107
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,039
I'm sorry, son.

108
00:08:47,805 --> 00:08:48,783
Right.

109
00:08:53,895 --> 00:08:55,074
Without a witness,

110
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,980
you'll never put this crime on Clay.

111
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:04,404
But I doubt Jax would be party
to anything that would hurt Opie.

112
00:09:07,682 --> 00:09:08,675
Maybe...

113
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,389
we let the outlaws serve up
their own justice.

114
00:09:18,086 --> 00:09:19,436
Food for thought.

115
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,373
Riding through this world

116
00:09:31,793 --> 00:09:32,815
All alone

117
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:35,880
God takes your soul

118
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,141
You're on your own

119
00:09:40,553 --> 00:09:42,288
The crow flies straight

120
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:44,862
A perfect line

121
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,831
On the devil's bed

122
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:50,839
Until you die

123
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,427
Gotta look this life

124
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,305
In the eye.

125
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,970
Episode 113: The Revelator

126
00:10:13,935 --> 00:10:15,822
- Is he okay?
- I can't get him to stop.

127
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,742
He's fed, I changed him...

128
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,492
- Where's Gemma?
- On her way.

129
00:10:26,615 --> 00:10:27,653
Come on.

130
00:10:32,623 --> 00:10:34,924
What's all that fuss about, hmm?

131
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:37,230
Here you go.

132
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:39,492
Come on.

133
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,303
You're all right, little dude.

134
00:10:50,047 --> 00:10:51,431
You're all right.

135
00:10:52,358 --> 00:10:55,080
I can't find the chapter
on ex-junkie moms.

136
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:59,073
I don't think our pages
have been written yet, sweetheart.

137
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:07,058
- What happened last night with us...?
- It was a hard night, Wendy.

138
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:09,367
The hell it was.

139
00:11:17,617 --> 00:11:19,046
I want this, Jax.

140
00:11:20,237 --> 00:11:21,579
He's your son.

141
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:24,372
- You have him.
- No, not just him.

142
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:29,102
We've done our dance, Wendy.

143
00:11:29,227 --> 00:11:30,884
But never like this.

144
00:11:31,283 --> 00:11:32,514
Not with him.

145
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,907
It can be different.

146
00:11:36,538 --> 00:11:38,959
We've been through
way too much shit.

147
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:44,531
I just want another chance.

148
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:49,608
This little guy at least deserves
that try, you know.

149
00:11:53,353 --> 00:11:55,082
Put together some time.

150
00:11:56,243 --> 00:11:57,243
All right?

151
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,467
See where it goes.

152
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:01,101
Okay, I will.

153
00:12:02,574 --> 00:12:04,740
I'm going to make this work, Jax.

154
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:27,788
All clear.

155
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:30,778
How is he?

156
00:12:32,462 --> 00:12:33,665
I don't know.

157
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,233
How do you think he is?

158
00:12:39,361 --> 00:12:40,865
There's no viewing.

159
00:12:41,451 --> 00:12:43,208
The funeral's tomorrow.

160
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:46,479
Let's get people down for this.

161
00:12:46,604 --> 00:12:48,269
A good show of support.

162
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,520
Happy's already in town.

163
00:12:51,055 --> 00:12:53,005
I'll start making some calls.

164
00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:01,195
I got to take responsibility
for this.

165
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:05,825
I was the one who pushed
for that deal with the Mayans.

166
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:10,120
I knew there was going to be
some kind of Niner blowback, but...

167
00:13:12,586 --> 00:13:14,500
I never thought
it would reach this far,

168
00:13:14,946 --> 00:13:18,119
- go this way.
- We all voted yes on that Mayan deal.

169
00:13:19,547 --> 00:13:21,803
- Nobody seen this coming.
- That's right.

170
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:24,496
Yeah, but it happened,
so how do we handle it?

171
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:26,971
The Niners are going
to be dealt with.

172
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:29,460
But right now let's just

173
00:13:29,737 --> 00:13:31,559
walk through this, be there for Ope.

174
00:13:31,857 --> 00:13:33,869
We help Ope by settling the score.

175
00:13:33,994 --> 00:13:35,444
We track down Laroy

176
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,815
and put a bullet
in that nigger's head.

177
00:13:39,742 --> 00:13:41,485
Now what are you looking at him for?

178
00:13:41,858 --> 00:13:44,572
- I'm the one talking to you.
- I know, brother.

179
00:13:47,805 --> 00:13:49,910
I know you're hurt.
Think you're trying to help...

180
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,912
Don't you tell me what I'm thinking.

181
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:54,119
You know,
if this happened to your family,

182
00:13:54,244 --> 00:13:57,252
there'd be six charters
halfway to Oakland.

183
00:13:57,434 --> 00:14:00,296
- This did happen in my family.
- No, it didn't!

184
00:14:00,994 --> 00:14:03,244
The Niners came gunning for my son.

185
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:07,094
They killed my daughter-in-law.
You got that, huh?

186
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,847
You got that kind of hole
in your family?

187
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:18,811
I got it.

188
00:14:34,928 --> 00:14:36,245
Where you going?

189
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,426
Nobody wants to even this out
more than me.

190
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:44,134
Let's just bury Donna,
catch our breath.

191
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:47,156
And then we'll do
what needs to be done.

192
00:14:48,738 --> 00:14:49,971
Let's do that.

193
00:14:57,827 --> 00:14:59,782
Keep an eye on the old man.

194
00:14:59,907 --> 00:15:01,301
Where's he going?

195
00:15:01,676 --> 00:15:04,109
I don't know.
That's why you're following him.

196
00:15:05,742 --> 00:15:06,695
Right.

197
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:16,172
Excuse me.

198
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:20,501
Can I have a minute?

199
00:15:21,194 --> 00:15:22,279
Yeah, sure.

200
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:38,825
I heard about
what happened to Donna.

201
00:15:40,683 --> 00:15:41,683
God,

202
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,632
I'm so sorry.

203
00:15:44,429 --> 00:15:45,406
Thanks.

204
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:48,722
Anybody know what happened?

205
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,738
I know you're busy.

206
00:16:00,061 --> 00:16:02,869
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

207
00:16:03,147 --> 00:16:04,501
I appreciate that.

208
00:16:06,952 --> 00:16:09,072
I'm sorry about last night. I...

209
00:16:11,147 --> 00:16:12,183
It's okay.

210
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:15,138
It's not okay.

211
00:16:18,822 --> 00:16:20,146
Nothing is okay.

212
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:25,483
Like the last few weeks, I...

213
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:30,446
I tried to follow your lead,
you know, find some kind of...

214
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,569
compartment to put all this stuff in,
but I just...

215
00:16:37,148 --> 00:16:38,667
I can't. I don't...

216
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:40,937
sleep.

217
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,744
I'm more scared now than I ever was.

218
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:47,519
I'm scared of getting caught,
I'm scared of not getting caught.

219
00:16:48,227 --> 00:16:49,941
We got away with murder.

220
00:16:51,384 --> 00:16:52,885
What does that make me?

221
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:54,433
A survivor.

222
00:17:00,906 --> 00:17:02,751
I think you're a good man,

223
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:04,561
with a big heart.

224
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,187
I believe you try and do
as much good as you can, but...

225
00:17:10,121 --> 00:17:13,083
You live a life I don't think
I'll ever

226
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,991
really understand.

227
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:23,840
I called Chicago Presbyterian today,

228
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:25,834
and they said they'd take me back.

229
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,479
And I think it's the best choice.

230
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:33,842
Don't you get tired of it?

231
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:36,810
Running?

232
00:17:37,995 --> 00:17:41,518
I'm not running.
I'm just being realistic, Jax.

233
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,497
Call it whatever you want.

234
00:17:44,138 --> 00:17:46,537
Your life is a series
of hit and runs.

235
00:17:47,438 --> 00:17:51,402
The minute someone makes you feel
uncomfortable, tests your loyalty,

236
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,823
little Tara packs her bags
and hits the road.

237
00:17:55,403 --> 00:17:57,950
I guess you got
what you wanted from me, right?

238
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,952
Used me to do your dirty work.

239
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:01,787
- That's not fair.
- Not fair?

240
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:04,562
You want to know how many women
I've slept with over the last ten years?

241
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:06,125
- Don't do this.
- Hundreds.

242
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,090
Maybe more. I don't know.

243
00:18:08,643 --> 00:18:10,514
I barely see their faces.

244
00:18:11,813 --> 00:18:14,163
I married Wendy
because I was lonely.

245
00:18:14,747 --> 00:18:17,497
Because I got tired
of the endless disconnect.

246
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,100
It was just a sad time-out.

247
00:18:21,312 --> 00:18:24,930
Because when I'm inside someone,
there's only one face I see.

248
00:18:30,822 --> 00:18:34,191
When you came home,
it was like some kind of sign to me.

249
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:38,866
Like my past coming round, giving me
another shot to do this different...

250
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:40,742
better.

251
00:18:44,231 --> 00:18:46,665
Now that chance
is running back to Chicago.

252
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,010
You take care, Doc.

253
00:19:20,294 --> 00:19:22,339
You think I could borrow your car?

254
00:19:22,464 --> 00:19:23,619
I need more wipes.

255
00:19:25,783 --> 00:19:28,415
My wallet's over there.
Just take what you need.

256
00:19:36,889 --> 00:19:38,348
That Jax's stuff?

257
00:19:39,115 --> 00:19:41,400
I figure I'd better unpack for him,

258
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:45,725
or the shit will be sitting
in the garage for the next three months.

259
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:47,897
You're like...

260
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,171
Dr. Jekyll and Donna Reed.

261
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:56,963
So you and Jax,

262
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,096
how's that coming?

263
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,642
He has his doubts
about me coming back.

264
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:05,062
We all do.

265
00:20:08,185 --> 00:20:09,620
I'm gonna convince him.

266
00:20:09,745 --> 00:20:12,447
I'm gonna be the girl
he fell in love with.

267
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:17,970
Good for you.

268
00:20:19,323 --> 00:20:20,373
Thanks.

269
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,087
All right, I'll be back.

270
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,460
Some shit never changes.

271
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:30,268
What's going on?

272
00:21:30,393 --> 00:21:32,951
I wanted to give you
this news in person.

273
00:21:33,076 --> 00:21:35,206
- That don't sound good.
- It's not.

274
00:21:35,331 --> 00:21:38,462
The U.S. Attorney is releasing
the details on the witness at 5:00.

275
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,885
At 5:01,
ATF is presenting their case

276
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,622
against Opie Winston
for Hefner's murder.

277
00:21:44,163 --> 00:21:45,938
Bring him in for a lineup.

278
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,766
From what the prosecution's shared,
he's probably not going back home.

279
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,241
- Jesus Christ.
- So what do we know?

280
00:21:52,366 --> 00:21:54,292
It's an eyewitness.
Probably a resident.

281
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:56,521
They offered wit pro.
That means he's in lockdown.

282
00:21:58,175 --> 00:22:00,190
Opie buries his wife tomorrow.

283
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:02,946
I'll drag my feet.

284
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:06,574
See that they don't bring him
in too early. Sorry.

285
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,490
Have my office call you
about my retainer?

286
00:22:12,377 --> 00:22:13,535
Sure. Thanks.

287
00:22:20,699 --> 00:22:22,507
G, Dog, go.

288
00:22:32,611 --> 00:22:34,837
Their whole case
against Bobby and Opie is that witness.

289
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:38,392
- Without him, they got nothing.
- So we got to get to him.

290
00:22:38,517 --> 00:22:40,441
- Kill him?
- He's a rat.

291
00:22:40,703 --> 00:22:42,853
Rats deserve to die. End of story.

292
00:22:44,577 --> 00:22:46,327
Wit pro means safe house.

293
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,138
24-hour protection.

294
00:22:48,263 --> 00:22:50,492
- That's a dead end.
- That can't be.

295
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:53,827
Opie goes back to prison,
what happens to his kids?

296
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,395
What, the state's gonna give them
to Piney or Mary?

297
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,575
- They're gonna end up in the system.
- And let's not forget Bobby.

298
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,831
He got I.D.'d

299
00:23:00,956 --> 00:23:03,547
because he had to clean up
after Ope's mistake.

300
00:23:04,721 --> 00:23:07,120
We got to do this
before the funeral.

301
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,580
Ope's family can't take another hit.

302
00:23:10,394 --> 00:23:11,844
- Agreed.
- Right.

303
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,519
Maybe Trammel can help.

304
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:17,561
If the safe house is in San Joaquin,
it's probably got sheriffs on it.

305
00:23:18,702 --> 00:23:19,604
Call Happy.

306
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,733
I'm sure one of his smiley face tats
is for a dead witness.

307
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:24,328
I'm on it.

308
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,697
I got like a serious problem here.
I followed Piney into Oakland.

309
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:30,198
What is he doing Oakland?

310
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:33,410
It looks like he's going into a bar.
But there are Niner tags everywhere.

311
00:23:35,085 --> 00:23:36,998
Piney went looking for Laroy.

312
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,393
- Oh, goddamn it!
- Crazy old coot.

313
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,035
- Where are you?
- 38th and Allendale.

314
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,362
Watch his back. We're on our way.

315
00:23:45,878 --> 00:23:47,995
- Let's go get him.
- Just get him out of there.

316
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,135
Deal with the Niners later.

317
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,471
- Let's go find Trammel.
- Right.

318
00:24:04,077 --> 00:24:05,484
Glad you could join me.

319
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,812
I was just,
you know, coming down to...

320
00:24:10,468 --> 00:24:12,617
see what you were doing and stuff.

321
00:24:14,383 --> 00:24:15,616
You need to...

322
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:18,568
brush up on your stealth skills.

323
00:24:19,517 --> 00:24:22,417
You did everything but wave at me
while you were following.

324
00:24:23,665 --> 00:24:25,081
I did wave at you actually.

325
00:24:25,206 --> 00:24:27,666
I was getting a little lost
coming off the 580 there.

326
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:29,802
I was hoping you'd slow down.

327
00:24:30,326 --> 00:24:31,808
If you're coming,

328
00:24:32,077 --> 00:24:33,815
let's go get this party started.

329
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,144
Okay, you know,
I was thinking we could not do that

330
00:24:36,269 --> 00:24:38,492
and just hang out here for a bit.

331
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,129
I don't need those guys.

332
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,455
I know what I gotta do.

333
00:24:48,455 --> 00:24:49,455
Shit.

334
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:01,998
If you're looking for the assisted
living home, it's two blocks south.

335
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:03,751
No, sweetheart.

336
00:25:04,744 --> 00:25:06,834
I got all the assistance I need.

337
00:25:09,947 --> 00:25:10,924
Sista.

338
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,217
Cracka.

339
00:25:19,255 --> 00:25:21,045
What kind of shit is this?

340
00:25:23,561 --> 00:25:24,849
What business you got here?

341
00:25:24,974 --> 00:25:26,691
Just looking for a friend.

342
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,608
You ain't got no friends here.

343
00:25:36,426 --> 00:25:37,700
Where's Laroy?

344
00:25:38,318 --> 00:25:40,651
Want to get yourself killed,
old man?

345
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:46,110
Well, I'm ready for that.

346
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:48,862
Are you?

347
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:53,396
Yeah, the feds put
us on some safe houses.

348
00:25:53,674 --> 00:25:55,260
You know, depends on the case.

349
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:58,792
- What's this about?
- I need to locate someone.

350
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:01,737
See how committed they
are to what they saw.

351
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:04,493
Jesus Christ, Clay.

352
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,042
You want me to hand
over a federal witness?

353
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:09,608
No, we just want to talk to him,
Trammel.

354
00:26:10,411 --> 00:26:12,499
How goddamned stupid do I look?

355
00:26:13,735 --> 00:26:16,381
Man, I don't care how
thick the envelope is.

356
00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:18,575
- All right, no.
- You don't understand.

357
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,207
I ain't offering you money.

358
00:26:21,987 --> 00:26:24,528
When this witness
fingers Opie and Bobby,

359
00:26:24,653 --> 00:26:26,103
ATF comes after us

360
00:26:26,938 --> 00:26:27,876
with RICO.

361
00:26:30,126 --> 00:26:31,504
- Shit.
- Yeah, man.

362
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,217
That means all of us,
and everybody attached to us goes down.

363
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:36,718
You do savvy that,

364
00:26:36,992 --> 00:26:38,867
my not stupid friend?

365
00:26:39,946 --> 00:26:41,730
Jesus Christ.

366
00:26:42,448 --> 00:26:44,601
We'll have the name of
the witness this afternoon.

367
00:26:45,793 --> 00:26:48,388
They're not going to use a name.

368
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:51,362
You're going to need a case number.

369
00:26:52,274 --> 00:26:53,551
A case number?

370
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:56,502
Where the hell are we
supposed to find that intel?

371
00:26:56,627 --> 00:26:58,673
The top of Charming's food chain.

372
00:27:17,814 --> 00:27:19,334
We got a problem.

373
00:27:25,034 --> 00:27:26,434
Go in, safety's off,

374
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:33,785
Shit.

375
00:27:36,449 --> 00:27:37,614
Crazy, old man.

376
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,948
This doesn't involve you, Jax.

377
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:43,034
These assholes

378
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:45,412
killed Donna,
and I'm gonna make that right.

379
00:27:45,987 --> 00:27:48,202
What the hell is he talking about?

380
00:27:54,085 --> 00:27:56,323
I get him to put down the revolver,

381
00:27:57,224 --> 00:27:59,456
you promise we walk
out of here alive?

382
00:28:03,245 --> 00:28:04,245
Yeah.

383
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:14,101
Put down the gun, Piney.

384
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:17,736
I ain't leaving till the nigger
that killed Donna is dead.

385
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,250
All right?!

386
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:28,373
Shithead.

387
00:28:30,233 --> 00:28:31,333
Easy.

388
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,080
Noise we made at the Mayan gun sale

389
00:28:34,205 --> 00:28:36,213
is about how pissed off we are.

390
00:28:36,531 --> 00:28:39,541
But if we wanted
your cracker asses dead...

391
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,766
Someone last night

392
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,168
in a gansta SUV
gunned down my daughter.

393
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:48,446
Now, that smells just
like nigger revenge to me.

394
00:28:48,571 --> 00:28:50,878
Nigger...

395
00:28:53,811 --> 00:28:56,361
Old, fat bastard here
says "nigger" one more time,

396
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:59,402
and that walking out
alive deal we talked about?

397
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:02,150
Off the Goddamn table.

398
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:05,408
Someone went after one of my guys.

399
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,087
Killed his wife by mistake.

400
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:12,832
It wasn't us.

401
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:16,568
So this "old, fat bastard"
is supposed to take your word for it,

402
00:29:16,693 --> 00:29:19,003
because you're an honorable,
and black man and all?

403
00:29:19,128 --> 00:29:20,128
Shut up!

404
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,176
Your trouble with us,

405
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:25,293
you work that out of your system?

406
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,474
- Or does this beef keep growing?
- Why do you keep talking about beefs?

407
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:32,602
Let me handle this
or I will kill you myself!

408
00:29:35,805 --> 00:29:38,897
Our business issues
still need to be worked out,

409
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:40,151
but if...

410
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,516
my need to hurt Sam Crow
took me to Charming,

411
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,323
had me killing women,

412
00:29:45,814 --> 00:29:48,464
do you think we'd
be sitting here talking?

413
00:29:51,171 --> 00:29:52,831
I'm telling you the truth.

414
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:55,151
Niners didn't kill your daughter.

415
00:29:56,844 --> 00:29:59,663
I suggest you boys find
your way back home...

416
00:29:59,788 --> 00:30:00,788
quickly.

417
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,391
How'd you get in here?

418
00:30:28,516 --> 00:30:31,286
I told the guy at the gate
we were here to fix your cars.

419
00:30:32,204 --> 00:30:34,054
Guess we look like the help.

420
00:30:37,949 --> 00:30:39,647
What's this about?

421
00:30:40,344 --> 00:30:42,459
This a great-looking horse, man.

422
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:45,925
I assume you got that,

423
00:30:46,234 --> 00:30:48,303
special delivery package I sent you?

424
00:30:48,568 --> 00:30:50,190
Yeah, I got it.

425
00:30:50,494 --> 00:30:52,974
You made your point.
I reneged on our deal.

426
00:30:55,507 --> 00:30:57,270
That knife.

427
00:30:57,747 --> 00:30:59,772
It's still got your
prints all over it.

428
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:02,525
The nut-less clown
raped your daughter?

429
00:31:03,063 --> 00:31:05,278
Well, he's buried in Macon Woods.

430
00:31:05,617 --> 00:31:06,772
Dead body,

431
00:31:07,593 --> 00:31:09,157
murder weapon, motive...

432
00:31:09,978 --> 00:31:12,659
The three things a guy
needs for a homicide conviction.

433
00:31:12,784 --> 00:31:15,107
Jesus Christ.
You're insane.

434
00:31:15,232 --> 00:31:16,581
I assure you, Elliot,

435
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,490
I'm saner than I've ever been.

436
00:31:23,358 --> 00:31:24,746
I need your help, Elliot.

437
00:31:24,871 --> 00:31:25,871
And...

438
00:31:26,423 --> 00:31:27,781
if you refuse,

439
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,846
I'm going to turn all three
of those items over to Unser.

440
00:31:32,127 --> 00:31:33,926
And the only thing you'll be riding

441
00:31:34,051 --> 00:31:37,060
is a big, black dude named Jo.

442
00:31:39,076 --> 00:31:40,536
So what do you want?

443
00:31:41,853 --> 00:31:44,331
I assume you got friends
in the U.S. Attorney's office.

444
00:31:44,456 --> 00:31:45,456
Maybe...

445
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:48,338
a couple of judges

446
00:31:48,463 --> 00:31:49,914
you play golf with?

447
00:31:57,687 --> 00:32:00,043
Where are we at with Donna's murder?

448
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:01,753
Nowhere.

449
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:03,672
No leads?

450
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,735
Suspicions?

451
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,110
No.

452
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:08,807
Sorry.

453
00:32:16,285 --> 00:32:17,480
Come with me.

454
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:24,539
Gives us some privacy.

455
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,360
For what?

456
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:34,856
I know how close you and Opie are.

457
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,242
I remember you
and him in high school.

458
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:40,748
You were inseparable.

459
00:32:41,438 --> 00:32:43,388
This is feeling a little gay.

460
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,828
I knew Stahl
was setting up Opie as a rat.

461
00:32:49,652 --> 00:32:51,102
She wired his truck.

462
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:54,766
I think Clay found that wire,

463
00:32:55,287 --> 00:32:57,547
thought Opie was
working with the Feds,

464
00:32:58,485 --> 00:33:00,101
and then tried have him killed.

465
00:33:04,036 --> 00:33:05,607
Donna was a mistake.

466
00:33:07,492 --> 00:33:09,610
Why are you telling me this shit?

467
00:33:10,644 --> 00:33:12,280
You think I'll give up Clay?

468
00:33:19,051 --> 00:33:22,290
We ended up on opposing teams.
You and me...

469
00:33:23,379 --> 00:33:25,761
don't like each other all that much,

470
00:33:26,364 --> 00:33:28,671
but seeing an innocent
woman gunned down?

471
00:33:29,253 --> 00:33:30,844
Two little kids...

472
00:33:32,653 --> 00:33:33,899
with no mom.

473
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:41,643
Man, I think that falls on the wrong
side of the fence for both of us.

474
00:34:43,013 --> 00:34:45,081
You got something you want to say?

475
00:34:50,753 --> 00:34:53,551
Donna Winston
was murdered last night.

476
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:58,669
- What are you talking about?
- She was gunned down.

477
00:35:01,736 --> 00:35:02,736
Brutal.

478
00:35:05,714 --> 00:35:08,501
Who the hell would
want to kill Opie's wife?

479
00:35:10,954 --> 00:35:12,479
You see, it was a...

480
00:35:14,851 --> 00:35:16,280
It was a mistake.

481
00:35:19,942 --> 00:35:22,660
The killer thought
that he was killing Opie.

482
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,257
Who went after Opie?

483
00:35:25,337 --> 00:35:27,122
I made Clay believe that Opie

484
00:35:27,247 --> 00:35:29,482
was the witness who fingered you.

485
00:35:33,908 --> 00:35:35,175
But it was a lie.

486
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:38,013
I set him up.

487
00:35:40,952 --> 00:35:42,621
Why you telling me this?

488
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,185
We'll be charging Opie

489
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:47,294
with Hefner's murder.

490
00:35:48,078 --> 00:35:49,937
Pick him up after
the funeral tomorrow.

491
00:35:50,998 --> 00:35:52,057
U.S. Attorney

492
00:35:52,182 --> 00:35:55,239
will seek the death
penalty for both of you.

493
00:36:00,365 --> 00:36:03,452
I guess I'm feeling guilty
about creating orphans.

494
00:36:07,241 --> 00:36:08,820
Thanks for listening.

495
00:36:18,822 --> 00:36:20,564
Beautiful animal.

496
00:36:22,037 --> 00:36:23,037
Yeah.

497
00:36:27,324 --> 00:36:28,936
Can I tell you something?

498
00:36:29,442 --> 00:36:32,481
Well, if it involves you and a horse,
I'd rather not hear it.

499
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,104
Yesterday...

500
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:39,208
Yesterday at the warehouse,

501
00:36:40,637 --> 00:36:42,167
Opie, he...

502
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,328
He saved me from getting
my head blown off.

503
00:36:47,691 --> 00:36:50,604
And then, I had a clear shot at him.

504
00:36:55,094 --> 00:36:56,665
And I couldn't take it.

505
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,350
You know?

506
00:37:01,746 --> 00:37:05,196
And shooting through
the back of that window in the truck?

507
00:37:08,846 --> 00:37:09,999
I was afraid.

508
00:37:11,494 --> 00:37:13,544
I was afraid if I saw his face,

509
00:37:13,951 --> 00:37:15,722
I couldn't pull the trigger.

510
00:37:16,654 --> 00:37:17,982
I didn't know,

511
00:37:18,499 --> 00:37:20,153
Clay, that it was Donna

512
00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:22,319
until it was done.

513
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:31,932
I depend on you
so much for that shit,

514
00:37:33,782 --> 00:37:35,961
sometimes I forget the weight of it.

515
00:37:37,772 --> 00:37:39,419
This thing with Op,

516
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,869
all that means is,

517
00:37:42,781 --> 00:37:44,711
you got love for your brothers.

518
00:37:49,817 --> 00:37:51,945
Donna, it was awful shit.

519
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:54,981
Awful.

520
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,559
We're going to get past this.

521
00:38:06,426 --> 00:38:07,566
Case number.

522
00:38:08,009 --> 00:38:10,719
What are you going
to do with that information?

523
00:38:10,844 --> 00:38:12,899
What'd you tell your Judge buddy?

524
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,886
That a councilman
wanted the information,

525
00:38:15,011 --> 00:38:17,461
because he didn't want
safe houses in his district.

526
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,133
Good.

527
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,423
Very good.

528
00:38:29,064 --> 00:38:30,597
What about that knife?

529
00:38:30,955 --> 00:38:32,465
It's still our secret.

530
00:38:33,053 --> 00:38:35,437
Don't worry,
we'll keep it safe for you.

531
00:38:37,188 --> 00:38:39,138
I called Happy on the prepay.

532
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:43,483
He had an alarming amount of knowledge
about safe houses and witnesses.

533
00:38:43,608 --> 00:38:45,280
Of course he did.

534
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:48,241
Said there's usually
a sheriff or two outside,

535
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,918
an ATF agent inside.

536
00:38:50,043 --> 00:38:52,425
Mostly rookies
who get stuck baby-sitting.

537
00:38:52,734 --> 00:38:56,384
- Thinks it'll take three guys.
- All right, me, Chibs, Happy.

538
00:38:59,252 --> 00:39:01,623
- You okay to do this?
- Yeah. I need to.

539
00:39:03,528 --> 00:39:04,542
All right.

540
00:39:05,454 --> 00:39:08,261
Give Trammel the case number.
Tell him to call us with the location.

541
00:39:08,945 --> 00:39:10,810
I want a flawless plan.

542
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:13,719
All right, you take out the witness.

543
00:39:14,448 --> 00:39:16,561
- Nobody else gets hurt.
- Okay, no mistakes.

544
00:39:21,529 --> 00:39:22,646
Where is he?

545
00:39:23,477 --> 00:39:25,134
Well, he's not back yet.

546
00:39:25,544 --> 00:39:26,544
Why?

547
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:31,368
What's the matter, Jackson?

548
00:39:32,165 --> 00:39:34,060
I got some information on Donna.

549
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:37,450
What information?

550
00:39:40,145 --> 00:39:41,888
Tell Clay I'm in the chapel.

551
00:40:48,411 --> 00:40:49,413
He knows.

552
00:40:50,096 --> 00:40:52,824
- What?
- Jax knows something about Donna.

553
00:40:54,293 --> 00:40:56,821
- He doesn't know shit.
- Listen to me.

554
00:40:57,202 --> 00:40:58,925
He knows everything.

555
00:41:01,256 --> 00:41:03,090
This was in one of his boxes.

556
00:41:03,825 --> 00:41:05,921
It's what he found in
storage when Abel was born.

557
00:41:07,457 --> 00:41:09,109
He wrote it all down.

558
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:12,195
All his pathetic hopes and dreams.

559
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:15,494
This is a book of
failures and fixes.

560
00:41:15,619 --> 00:41:17,856
John is speaking to him
from the goddamn grave.

561
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:21,027
- You're being hysterical.
- I told you to nail Jax down.

562
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:23,076
- Bring him closer!
- This is a bunch of words.

563
00:41:23,201 --> 00:41:26,797
- It's a bunch of shit!
- It means everything to my Jax!

564
00:41:29,702 --> 00:41:30,999
I know my son.

565
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:34,120
He is restless,
just like his old man.

566
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,862
Always looking for something more,

567
00:41:36,987 --> 00:41:38,406
the reasons why.

568
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,723
This shit is going to send
him on a destiny run.

569
00:41:43,306 --> 00:41:44,806
Reading those secrets,

570
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:47,838
finding out about
the Donna mistake...

571
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:51,475
What happened to John.

572
00:41:54,648 --> 00:41:56,969
I cannot do that again.

573
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,466
- Not with him.
- Now you listen to me.

574
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,366
What he read there,

575
00:42:03,491 --> 00:42:06,178
were the ramblings of a bitter,
grieving coward.

576
00:42:06,759 --> 00:42:07,672
 Look at it,

577
00:42:07,797 --> 00:42:10,510
it's half-way burned.
Probably pissed him off.

578
00:42:10,886 --> 00:42:12,923
So don't tell me he's poisoned!

579
00:42:13,515 --> 00:42:15,265
And this shit with Donna,

580
00:42:15,421 --> 00:42:17,071
there's nothing to know.

581
00:42:18,165 --> 00:42:19,938
So you'd better calm down.

582
00:42:22,922 --> 00:42:24,493
This is about your fear,

583
00:42:24,797 --> 00:42:26,013
your history.

584
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,425
You stop bleeding all over him.

585
00:42:31,264 --> 00:42:32,915
And finish burning that.

586
00:42:41,621 --> 00:42:43,223
You are losing control.

587
00:42:47,236 --> 00:42:48,621
Just like he did.

588
00:42:55,863 --> 00:42:57,600
You're looking for me?

589
00:43:11,698 --> 00:43:13,456
Two days ago, you sat there.

590
00:43:15,435 --> 00:43:16,956
You made me a promise.

591
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:21,495
Told me Opie was safe.

592
00:43:23,948 --> 00:43:25,398
Now I'm asking you,

593
00:43:26,222 --> 00:43:27,568
brother to brother,

594
00:43:27,693 --> 00:43:29,213
father to son,

595
00:43:30,237 --> 00:43:31,687
to tell me the truth

596
00:43:32,122 --> 00:43:33,489
and I'll accept it.

597
00:43:34,675 --> 00:43:35,841
Whatever it is.

598
00:43:38,886 --> 00:43:40,457
Just be honest with me.

599
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:47,079
Did you try to kill Opie,

600
00:43:48,156 --> 00:43:49,866
kill Donna by mistake?

601
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,974
I don't know who's been filling
your head with this shit, son.

602
00:44:05,058 --> 00:44:06,730
I'm-a tell you again.

603
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,532
I love Opie, loved Donna.

604
00:44:13,274 --> 00:44:15,366
I'd never do nothing to hurt them.

605
00:44:26,104 --> 00:44:28,290
It's a rough time for Sam Crow.

606
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,167
But we'd better put
this shit behind us.

607
00:44:32,513 --> 00:44:34,986
Suspicion, resentment...

608
00:44:37,144 --> 00:44:40,159
that kind of shit eats up morale,
fractures a charter.

609
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:42,659
Yeah.

610
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:45,176
That's true.

611
00:44:55,213 --> 00:44:56,776
You know where Tig is?

612
00:44:57,501 --> 00:44:58,236
Yeah.

613
00:44:58,732 --> 00:45:00,604
He's on his way to the safe house.

614
00:45:00,729 --> 00:45:02,061
What's the matter?

615
00:45:04,169 --> 00:45:06,673
The info on
that witness just came out.

616
00:45:08,016 --> 00:45:10,002
She's a 17-year-old girl, Jax.

617
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,800
Holy shit.

618
00:45:17,603 --> 00:45:18,824
Where are they?

619
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,439
What are you doing?

620
00:45:26,152 --> 00:45:27,902
Where the hell you going?

621
00:45:32,733 --> 00:45:33,733
Shit.

622
00:45:38,513 --> 00:45:39,936
Let's do this.
Go.

623
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:59,091
Westly?

624
00:46:07,334 --> 00:46:09,384
- Sheriff Lane, you copy?
- Go.

625
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:14,521
Shit.

626
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:15,995
Drop it, bitch.

627
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:19,984
Give me that gun.

628
00:46:20,381 --> 00:46:21,381
Step up.

629
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:23,157
Take her.

630
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:38,294
Jesus Christ!

631
00:46:39,355 --> 00:46:41,306
You've got to be shitting me.

632
00:46:42,827 --> 00:46:43,998
Our witness.

633
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,355
A house call. ***

634
00:46:53,471 --> 00:46:54,878
I was on my way home from work,

635
00:46:55,003 --> 00:46:57,377
just thought I'd
stop by and check in.

636
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,910
I guess I miss him, you know?

637
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,030
Yeah, I do.

638
00:47:24,792 --> 00:47:25,792
How is he?

639
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,070
I can do this, bro.

640
00:47:58,024 --> 00:47:59,372
No, it's me.

641
00:48:14,863 --> 00:48:15,863
Sorry.

642
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,359
I'm really sorry, kid.

643
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:25,946
Jesus!

644
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,945
You scared the shit out of me, man.

645
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:29,862
- Put down the gun.
- What?

646
00:48:30,977 --> 00:48:32,659
We don't kill women.

647
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,661
What are you doing here, brother?

648
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,001
- What the hell is this?
- Put it down,

649
00:48:42,126 --> 00:48:44,853
or I will put a bullet
in your temple.

650
00:48:45,063 --> 00:48:47,006
You think you got
the balls to do that?

651
00:48:56,092 --> 00:48:56,891
All right.

652
00:49:01,601 --> 00:49:04,948
- You two, get out of here.
- This wasn't the plan.

653
00:49:05,262 --> 00:49:08,361
- You think this through.
- Go home, now.

654
00:49:10,279 --> 00:49:11,279
Let's go.

655
00:49:20,103 --> 00:49:21,457
You see this guy?

656
00:49:22,138 --> 00:49:25,378
He's a bad guy, and he wants you dead.
You know why?

657
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:28,214
'Cause you're gonna rat
on two of his friends!

658
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,962
So you can't do that.

659
00:49:30,087 --> 00:49:32,760
'Cause he will find you
no matter where you are.

660
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,132
And next time,
I won't be there to save your life.

661
00:49:35,257 --> 00:49:36,300
You understand?

662
00:49:36,425 --> 00:49:39,633
The Feds, the cops...
nobody can protect you, that's obvious.

663
00:49:39,758 --> 00:49:41,144
If you testify,

664
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,654
- you will die.
- I won't, I promise.

665
00:49:51,097 --> 00:49:52,784
You get a train, you get a bus,

666
00:49:52,909 --> 00:49:55,020
you steal a goddamn car...
I don't give a shit.

667
00:49:55,145 --> 00:49:57,910
You get out of California tonight,
or you're dead!

668
00:49:59,953 --> 00:50:02,426
You just crossed the line, brother.

669
00:50:03,946 --> 00:50:05,043
You know?

670
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:07,397
Not yet.

671
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:37,464
- Come on.
- Bring it.

672
00:50:58,889 --> 00:50:59,889
Come on.

673
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:41,351
To my oldest,
dearest and wisest friend.

674
00:51:41,937 --> 00:51:45,848
What we started, you and I,
was a good thing, for a good reason.

675
00:51:46,767 --> 00:51:49,217
What we've become
is a different thing,

676
00:51:49,529 --> 00:51:51,799
for reasons I no longer understand.

677
00:51:52,823 --> 00:51:54,777
I feel angry winds at my back,

678
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,705
and I'm not sure how much time
I have left in this cut I love so much.

679
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:02,647
This book is for all
the things we wanted,

680
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,320
and for all the things
we still can be.

681
00:52:05,627 --> 00:52:06,813
I love you, brother.

682
00:52:06,938 --> 00:52:07,938
J.T.

683
00:54:53,955 --> 00:54:55,871
Go catch up with your grandma.

684
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:14,079
Thanks.

685
00:55:14,712 --> 00:55:15,977
You're welcome.

686
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:19,587
- Here.
- Keep it.

687
00:55:20,986 --> 00:55:21,986
Thanks.

688
00:55:27,753 --> 00:55:29,576
It's cool water down there.

689
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,565
Time for a change.

690
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:06,680

691
01:01:06,805 --> 01:01:09,790
