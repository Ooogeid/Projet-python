1
00:00:17,228 --> 00:00:19,169
Hold it, hold, it, hold it!

2
00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:23,269
Holy shit.

3
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:37,789
Appreciate the lift.

4
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:39,208
No problem.

5
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:40,839
Where's the Cutlass?

6
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:44,381
- It's at the hospital.
- Still not running right?

7
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:48,053
It's running okay.

8
00:00:50,687 --> 00:00:52,364
This worry I'm getting here.

9
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:54,932
Have anything to do with that car
that's been following us?

10
00:00:56,536 --> 00:00:59,213
The compact parked
halfway down the block.

11
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:11,288
What the hell's going on?

12
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:17,863
That ATF agent

13
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:21,250
that's been looking into you guys.

14
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,766
I think he's here for me.

15
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:27,514
- What are you talking about?
- I was with him in Chicago.

16
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:31,401
It got violent. I tried to end it.
He started stalking me.

17
00:01:35,764 --> 00:01:38,379
- Don't. He's dangerous.
- Go back inside, Tara.

18
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:39,713
Lock the door.

19
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:50,628
Vandalism, deadly weapon.
That's six months in County, asshole.

20
00:01:50,748 --> 00:01:53,824
Violating a restraining order.
You'll be in the cell next to me.

21
00:01:53,985 --> 00:01:56,327
They teach you
how to suck a dick in ATF school?

22
00:01:57,611 --> 00:01:58,804
Badass biker.

23
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:01,807
You guys gave it your best shot.

24
00:02:01,927 --> 00:02:03,863
You got nothing on Sam Crow.

25
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:05,593
And you harassing Tara.

26
00:02:05,713 --> 00:02:06,960
That ends here.

27
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,007
Or next time it won't be your piece
of shit car I'm draining fluid from.

28
00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:12,217
You threatening a federal agent?

29
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:13,846
I'm threatening you.

30
00:02:14,893 --> 00:02:15,893
Go away.

31
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:17,875
It's my last warning.

32
00:02:25,117 --> 00:02:27,688
You'd better rein
in your ATF boyfriend.

33
00:02:28,017 --> 00:02:30,486
Agent Kohn isn't on my payroll.
I don't keep tabs.

34
00:02:30,648 --> 00:02:32,081
Well, maybe you should.

35
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:35,351
He's not here for Sam Crow, Hale.
He's here for Tara.

36
00:02:35,952 --> 00:02:39,631
- What the hell are you talking about?
- This guy was stalking her in Chicago.

37
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:42,395
Thinks she came back to Charming
to be with me. I'm telling you:

38
00:02:42,515 --> 00:02:45,265
this guy is nuts
and he's going to hurt her.

39
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:47,227
Jesus Christ.

40
00:02:47,347 --> 00:02:49,463
That's who she had
a restraining order against.

41
00:02:49,624 --> 00:02:50,657
You knew?

42
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,052
No, but it makes sense now.

43
00:02:53,378 --> 00:02:54,378
Hale.

44
00:02:54,649 --> 00:02:56,057
Let's go, hotshot.

45
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:59,845
Water and Power just dug up
some old bones out on 44.

46
00:03:00,177 --> 00:03:01,642
Be there in a minute.

47
00:03:04,623 --> 00:03:06,173
Kohn is my problem.

48
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:08,741
I will handle it.

49
00:03:09,127 --> 00:03:10,397
You'd better, man,

50
00:03:10,517 --> 00:03:11,667
or I'm gonna.

51
00:03:17,044 --> 00:03:19,331
Half-Sack, bomaye.
Get in there, kid.

52
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:22,631
- My money's on Lowell.
- Now you're getting cocky.

53
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:25,270
Anyone can beat up a junkie,
prospect.

54
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,740
Doesn't mean shit.

55
00:03:27,412 --> 00:03:29,276
Where'd you learn
to fight like this?

56
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:32,129
I was Junior Lightweight Champion,

57
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:35,558
- Armed Forces Boxing Competition.
- That's so hot.

58
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,460
Things all better
with the little missus now?

59
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,430
My balls are still attached.

60
00:03:46,595 --> 00:03:48,721
Shit, Lowell, get out of there.

61
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:51,903
- Whose idea was this?
- Bobby's.

62
00:03:52,388 --> 00:03:54,201
I don't I don't mind it, Clay.

63
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:57,334
- I'm just... helping Half-Sack train.
- Well, you killed enough brain cells.

64
00:03:57,454 --> 00:03:59,241
Come on, come on. Back to work.

65
00:04:00,784 --> 00:04:01,620
Thanks.

66
00:04:03,216 --> 00:04:05,585
- How's he doing?
- The latest round of rehab

67
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:08,676
seems to be sticking.
He hasn't missed any work.

68
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:11,273
If I could get AA to kick up a vig,

69
00:04:11,393 --> 00:04:12,796
Lowell could make us all rich.

70
00:04:12,957 --> 00:04:14,770
He's always been a freak.

71
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,140
He's a damn good mechanic.
I guess you taught him that.

72
00:04:18,955 --> 00:04:20,707
How's Sugar Ray One-Nut looking?

73
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,682
He's wicked fast.
He's got a great right hook.

74
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:26,894
How much money gets thrown around
at these bare-fist things?

75
00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:30,092
The purse is okay,
but it's the betting that's gone crazy.

76
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:33,217
I know a couple of guys last year,
made six figures each.

77
00:04:33,337 --> 00:04:34,927
- Really?
- The prospect could knock

78
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:37,003
those lightweights out
any day of the week.

79
00:04:37,123 --> 00:04:38,239
Absolutely.

80
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,315
What'd we pull together for McKeavy?

81
00:04:40,435 --> 00:04:41,579
120.

82
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,955
You ain't thinking about betting
on the prospect?

83
00:04:46,116 --> 00:04:48,207
You know, if Half-Sack
takes his first five fights

84
00:04:48,368 --> 00:04:50,210
and looks strong
going into the finish,

85
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,180
we control how it ends.
Could be a huge payday.

86
00:04:53,903 --> 00:04:55,306
What do you think?

87
00:04:55,705 --> 00:04:56,855
I don't know.

88
00:04:57,453 --> 00:04:59,650
But I do know there's no way
we're raising 80 grand

89
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,620
in the next four days, so...

90
00:05:01,892 --> 00:05:03,542
Might be our only shot.

91
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:07,017
- I'm in.
- I'm in.

92
00:05:07,137 --> 00:05:08,137
Done.

93
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,021
All right, I'm in.

94
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,539
Take 50 grand.

95
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:13,858
I want to see it triple.
You're going to train him.

96
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:15,651
No booze, no weed, no pussy.

97
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:19,729
That include the Nevada sweetbutt?

98
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:23,786
Until I'm up a hundred K, ***the Nevada
sweetbutt*** can cool on the counter.

99
00:05:25,535 --> 00:05:26,535
Bobby.

100
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:29,198
Do me a favor.

101
00:05:30,078 --> 00:05:31,500
Push up on that thing, will you?

102
00:05:32,673 --> 00:05:34,246
- Really?
- Really.

103
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:36,453
Halfy-Sacky's all about that now.

104
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:38,368
I want to see
if she's all about him.

105
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:39,717
And go at it hard.

106
00:05:41,528 --> 00:05:44,863
- I ain't mad at that.
- Half-Sack's going to lose his mind.

107
00:05:44,983 --> 00:05:47,950
Well, that kind of anger
we can really use.

108
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:51,181
Call Unser, see if he wants in
on some of this fight action.

109
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:53,051
Clay, he's out on the job.

110
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:56,435
Water and Power dug up
some old bones this morning.

111
00:05:56,555 --> 00:05:58,324
- Where?
- Out on 44.

112
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:02,986
What?

113
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:12,850
Wheeling out two bodies.

114
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,362
Should be three.

115
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,701
- I'm afraid to ask.
- Don't be.

116
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:19,220
There it is.

117
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:22,355
Was this us?

118
00:06:29,907 --> 00:06:30,917
Shit.

119
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:07,038
Episode 107: Old Bones

120
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:13,227
All three of them were Mayans?

121
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:15,437
Back in '92,

122
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:18,143
Mexicans tried to expand
their Oakland dope base.

123
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:20,013
Set up a charter in Lodi.

124
00:07:20,698 --> 00:07:22,152
We couldn't let that happen.

125
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:24,831
Was a bloody two years.
Bodies dropped.

126
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:26,573
I remember.

127
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:28,909
That was right around
the time my old man died.

128
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:30,425
That's right.

129
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,207
We got to stop the PD
from IDing those bodies, man.

130
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,583
I mean, if they flag the Mayans,
we're their next stop.

131
00:07:35,703 --> 00:07:39,210
We can pull teeth to stop the ID,
but they can still DNA test.

132
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,380
Forensic tests on three bodies?

133
00:07:42,386 --> 00:07:44,457
That would blow half
of Unser's yearly budget.

134
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:46,269
But if Hale thought
it would hurt us,

135
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:48,762
he could get his new fed buddies
to float the cost.

136
00:07:48,923 --> 00:07:50,592
Shit, man, that was pre-O.J., right?

137
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:52,767
I mean, we weren't thinking
about DNA,

138
00:07:52,887 --> 00:07:56,707
right, back in '93. What kind of clues
we got buried with those Mexicans?

139
00:07:56,827 --> 00:07:59,316
If they don't know they're Mayans,
they won't take it any further.

140
00:07:59,476 --> 00:08:01,315
We stop the identification.

141
00:08:01,435 --> 00:08:03,208
We stop the investigation.

142
00:08:13,263 --> 00:08:15,513
There's a $15K purse on the line...

143
00:08:16,302 --> 00:08:18,402
and a lot of ringside action.

144
00:08:19,014 --> 00:08:20,014
I'm ready.

145
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:22,504
This ain't no Army boxing, kid.
This is street brawling.

146
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:23,816
No, it's cool.

147
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,890
Cherry Pie.

148
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:30,833
- What?
- It's time to go.

149
00:08:30,953 --> 00:08:33,303
What are you talking about?
Go where?

150
00:08:33,423 --> 00:08:35,726
- What are you doing, Bobby?
- Relax, prospect.

151
00:08:35,888 --> 00:08:37,896
She's going to stay with him
till the fight.

152
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:38,962
No, I'm not.

153
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:40,773
- Oh, yeah, you are.
- Why?

154
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:43,692
No booze, no dope.

155
00:08:43,853 --> 00:08:44,669
No pussy.

156
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:48,405
- You'll love my place. Very cozy.
- Get your hands off me.

157
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:50,033
- Quarantine.
- Back off!

158
00:08:50,194 --> 00:08:51,618
Clay, you know, no...

159
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:54,828
sex before a fight's like
an old wives' thing, man.

160
00:08:56,928 --> 00:08:59,334
Did you just insult
my old lady again?

161
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:02,705
Jump him.

162
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,077
Why didn't you tell me it was Kohn?

163
00:09:16,584 --> 00:09:17,789
Jax told you?

164
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:21,522
I did not know that Kohn
was the guy that was stalking you.

165
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:25,526
- I could have...
- I tried getting help in Chicago.

166
00:09:25,687 --> 00:09:27,630
Complained to his superiors.
Made things worse.

167
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,268
I went through three precincts

168
00:09:29,388 --> 00:09:32,644
before someone'd even
give me that restraining order.

169
00:09:32,764 --> 00:09:34,714
Doubted you could do anything.

170
00:09:39,515 --> 00:09:42,365
Kohn's boss doesn't even know
that he is here.

171
00:09:42,643 --> 00:09:44,831
This guy is in deep shit.

172
00:09:45,643 --> 00:09:46,643
He is done.

173
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:48,455
Really?

174
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,479
He is leaving Charming.

175
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:51,878
I promise.

176
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,018
And I am sorry.

177
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:02,619
Town's talking about the skulls
that rolled out of that hole.

178
00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:03,857
I'm sure they are.

179
00:10:04,323 --> 00:10:06,543
You thought about damage control?

180
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,589
Tig's the only one
who knows the truth.

181
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,898
Everybody else thinks
all those bodies are Mayans.

182
00:10:11,018 --> 00:10:13,098
And how do you stop that truth
from spreading?

183
00:10:13,218 --> 00:10:15,781
I got it covered.
All right? Don't worry.

184
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:18,316
This shit stays in the rearview.

185
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:29,212
I talked to Trammel.

186
00:10:29,332 --> 00:10:31,584
Sanwa County Coroner's
clearing space,

187
00:10:31,704 --> 00:10:33,782
but bones stay local tonight.

188
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:35,456
Good.

189
00:10:36,016 --> 00:10:38,772
Now I have to get into
the lower level of the hospital.

190
00:10:38,892 --> 00:10:39,892
You...

191
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,117
think the old squeeze
might be able to hook a brother up?

192
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:46,566
- I'll see what I can do.
- Alright.

193
00:10:47,653 --> 00:10:48,883
Sorry, Clay.

194
00:10:49,705 --> 00:10:50,911
I just asked Gemma,

195
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:53,231
just wanted to make sure it was okay
that I have Moby here

196
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:54,773
only during my break.

197
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,910
He likes to watch me work.

198
00:10:57,267 --> 00:10:58,617
Sure. That's fine.

199
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,105
You're doing good work.

200
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:11,529
Thanks, man.

201
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:22,309
All right, Tara's not here.

202
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,026
- What do you want to do?
- Lab coat on the chair.

203
00:11:25,146 --> 00:11:26,713
You distract the doctors.

204
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,283
Yeah, not a problem.

205
00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:30,401
Excuse me, ladies.

206
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:32,166
How you doing?

207
00:11:32,286 --> 00:11:34,243
You're doctors, both of you?

208
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:35,517
Thank God.

209
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:39,185
Doberman pinscher,
you know, took a chunk...

210
00:11:39,305 --> 00:11:41,604
- Jesus Christ. No, hang out.
- Took a chunk out of my ass.

211
00:11:41,724 --> 00:11:44,263
- Can we...
- You need to go to the ER.

212
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,466
Distract them. I said distract them,
not scar them for life.

213
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:49,587
No, shit, I'm serious.
Man, I think it's infected.

214
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:08,210
***A man *** just steal
a key card from an intern.

215
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,273
Hopefully it gets us below.

216
00:12:10,393 --> 00:12:12,149
Me and Tig'll take care of this.

217
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:15,019
Why don't you stay here
and run interference.

218
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:16,144
Why?

219
00:12:19,794 --> 00:12:21,381
Kid looks strong, huh?

220
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:27,541
You have a good night, all right?

221
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:29,653
You, too.

222
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:35,820
Nurse said you wanted to see me.

223
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,482
I was just checking in.

224
00:12:37,602 --> 00:12:38,646
You okay?

225
00:12:39,505 --> 00:12:40,643
I talked to Hale.

226
00:12:40,763 --> 00:12:43,015
He assured me Joshua was leaving.

227
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:45,357
Thanks for...

228
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,920
handling that.

229
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,994
You're welcome.

230
00:12:49,523 --> 00:12:52,434
You won't have to worry
about that guy anymore.

231
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,419
H, I, J, K...

232
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:41,450
L, M, N, O, P...

233
00:13:42,976 --> 00:13:44,866
Q, R, S...

234
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:47,790
T, U, V...

235
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:50,056
W, X,

236
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,026
Y, and Z...

237
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:02,394
- I'll find us some gloves.
- Okay.

238
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,230
Freako.

239
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:22,196
- We ain't here to find you a date.
- I know.

240
00:14:23,217 --> 00:14:25,201
I know, it's just... you know.

241
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:26,738
You ever...?

242
00:14:28,194 --> 00:14:29,194
What?

243
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:31,071
- Cold-pack?
- Yeah.

244
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:33,060
No. Not my thing.

245
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,769
I know
it's a little bit creepy at first.

246
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:39,091
But then something happens, man.

247
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,461
I'm telling you.

248
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:42,600
This soothing coldness,

249
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,593
the stillness,
I mean, it's really a beautiful thing.

250
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:47,323
Please, please,

251
00:14:47,443 --> 00:14:48,350
stop.

252
00:14:51,846 --> 00:14:52,854
Goddamn it.

253
00:14:53,782 --> 00:14:55,085
It's all right.

254
00:14:56,893 --> 00:14:59,409
I thought I told you
to wait upstairs.

255
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:01,466
There's no interference to run.

256
00:15:01,586 --> 00:15:04,031
And I figured you could use
the extra pair of hands.

257
00:15:04,151 --> 00:15:05,366
Is that all right?

258
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:07,055
I got 'em.

259
00:15:08,522 --> 00:15:09,522
All three.

260
00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:16,115
Hold the head.

261
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:17,963
Tight.

262
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:22,269
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

263
00:15:22,585 --> 00:15:24,134
It's already been ID'd.

264
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:33,011
Lowell Harlan, Senior.

265
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:39,388
This is Lowell's old man.

266
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,764
Cookie time.

267
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,461
I made 'em.

268
00:15:53,874 --> 00:15:55,406
Especially for you.

269
00:15:55,526 --> 00:15:56,676
No, thank you.

270
00:16:06,753 --> 00:16:07,986
Stop. Please.

271
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:09,888
Come on, girl.

272
00:16:11,873 --> 00:16:13,713
You ain't no old lady yet.

273
00:16:15,311 --> 00:16:16,311
You...

274
00:16:18,998 --> 00:16:20,436
do this for me...

275
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:26,301
I'll make sure that you get
the thumbs-up from Clay.

276
00:16:27,915 --> 00:16:30,171
- Stop, okay? Please.
- Come on.

277
00:16:30,815 --> 00:16:31,860
Stop!

278
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:34,913
I'm not a sweetbutt!

279
00:16:35,748 --> 00:16:38,409
- Yeah, you are.
- No, I'm not. I came here for Kip.

280
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:40,721
I'm not gonna be passed around anymore,
all right?

281
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:41,969
I'm done with that.

282
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:43,714
- Come on.
- Seriously!

283
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,898
Jesus!

284
00:16:58,525 --> 00:16:59,525
Okay.

285
00:17:02,785 --> 00:17:03,735
Okay?

286
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:05,815
I said... "Okay."

287
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:13,674
Relax. Have a cookie.

288
00:17:14,712 --> 00:17:17,362
Why was Lowell's dad
buried with the enemy?

289
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:19,651
Casualty of war.

290
00:17:20,435 --> 00:17:21,725
Mayans took him out.

291
00:17:21,845 --> 00:17:25,130
- He worked at T-M. He wasn't patched.
- Mayans went after everybody.

292
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:26,970
Family, friends, didn't matter.

293
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,221
Lowell thinks his dad just split.

294
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:32,191
Poor bastard's convinced
he's still out there.

295
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:33,635
I know.

296
00:17:34,363 --> 00:17:36,051
So, why the same grave?

297
00:17:36,652 --> 00:17:37,802
A disrespect.

298
00:17:39,565 --> 00:17:40,586
I know.

299
00:17:42,154 --> 00:17:45,859
It was a crazy two years. I didn't have
time to think a lot of shit through.

300
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,082
Is that why you didn't want me
in the morgue?

301
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,572
Protect that secret?

302
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:54,466
I got no secrets from you.

303
00:17:57,858 --> 00:17:58,903
You know,

304
00:17:59,526 --> 00:18:00,833
with the Mayans ID'd, too,

305
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:05,113
I can only imagine the poison
Hale's gonna pour on Lowell's ear.

306
00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:07,238
I'll handle Lowell.

307
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,119
Sounds good.

308
00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:30,639
Is it cool if I work on it
before my shift?

309
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:39,764
Is everything okay, man?

310
00:18:42,253 --> 00:18:44,218
I want you to hear this from me.

311
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:46,317
What?
Something happen to Moby?

312
00:18:46,437 --> 00:18:49,387
- I left him with Neeta...
- No, your kid's fine.

313
00:18:52,962 --> 00:18:54,054
Those bodies

314
00:18:54,618 --> 00:18:57,295
they pulled out of the hole on 44.

315
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,896
One of them's your old man.

316
00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:08,515
My dad?

317
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:12,927
That don't make sense.

318
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,077
I'm sorry, son.

319
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:23,641
No, he ran off when I was like, 15.

320
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:27,564
He just split.
Everyone told me that.

321
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:30,090
You told me that.

322
00:19:31,611 --> 00:19:32,611
I know.

323
00:19:39,142 --> 00:19:40,142
Well...

324
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:44,316
son of a bitch
was already dead to me, right?

325
00:19:48,594 --> 00:19:49,594
What...

326
00:19:52,354 --> 00:19:53,956
what happened to him?

327
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,237
Mayan war.

328
00:19:58,617 --> 00:20:00,323
Wrong place, wrong time.

329
00:20:02,644 --> 00:20:05,608
The other bodies
they found in the hole

330
00:20:06,995 --> 00:20:09,624
was two Mexicans
who killed your dad.

331
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,406
Vengeance was meted out.

332
00:20:17,902 --> 00:20:19,289
The cops...

333
00:20:19,856 --> 00:20:22,601
They're gonna try to lay
all those bodies at Sam Crow's feet.

334
00:20:23,527 --> 00:20:24,948
- That's bullshit.
- I know.

335
00:20:25,068 --> 00:20:26,896
It ain't a matter of true or false.

336
00:20:27,207 --> 00:20:30,525
Hale is gonna try
to screw with your compass.

337
00:20:32,505 --> 00:20:34,719
I don't want you losing true north.

338
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,878
Inside the club,
there had to be truth.

339
00:21:13,998 --> 00:21:15,711
Our word was our honor.

340
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:18,752
But outside,
it was all about deception.

341
00:21:18,872 --> 00:21:20,825
Lies were our defense, our default.

342
00:21:21,824 --> 00:21:24,420
To survive,
you had to master the art of perjury.

343
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,190
The lie and the truth
had to feel the same.

344
00:21:27,616 --> 00:21:29,577
But once you learn that skill,

345
00:21:29,697 --> 00:21:32,587
nobody knows the truth,
in or outside the club.

346
00:21:33,848 --> 00:21:35,098
Especially you.

347
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:52,881
My God...

348
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:15,964
Holy shit!

349
00:22:19,794 --> 00:22:22,330
The two bodies were Mayan captains.
It had to be Sam Crow.

350
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,528
Yeah, well, 15-year-old Mexican
bones give us nothing.

351
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:28,286
Even with DNA,
there's no murder weapon

352
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:32,053
so it's ancient history.
The US Attorney's Office won't touch it.

353
00:22:32,173 --> 00:22:33,381
Look at this.

354
00:22:35,256 --> 00:22:37,402
Dead mechanic
worked for Teller-Morrow.

355
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:40,822
History of drug abuse, domestic
violence... his kid's on the way in.

356
00:22:40,982 --> 00:22:43,074
Following his old man's footsteps,

357
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:44,344
close to Sam Crow.

358
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:46,432
- How close?
- Not sure.

359
00:22:48,418 --> 00:22:49,706
Any word on Kohn?

360
00:22:50,815 --> 00:22:52,133
Checked out of his hotel,

361
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:55,170
turned in his rental car.
He may already be gone. Here we go.

362
00:22:57,218 --> 00:22:59,751
- You, wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

363
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,927
Have a seat, Lowell.

364
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:05,315
I'm June Stahl, federal agent.

365
00:23:05,811 --> 00:23:09,090
I'm here helping out
the deputy chief.

366
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:11,308
Yeah?
Helping out with what?

367
00:23:11,428 --> 00:23:15,200
We have some sad news
for you about your father.

368
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,402
Yeah, I know.
They found him in that hole off of 44.

369
00:23:20,072 --> 00:23:22,489
Well, you don't seem
too surprised by that, Lowell.

370
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:26,698
- You live by the sword, you know?
- He was a mechanic, not a gangster.

371
00:23:26,818 --> 00:23:29,505
- Why was he buried with outlaw bikers?
- I don't know.

372
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,481
Your old man worked
for Teller-Morrow, right?

373
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:32,601
Yeah.

374
00:23:33,243 --> 00:23:35,922
So the Sons of Anarchy
must've trusted him.

375
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:37,310
He was a friend.

376
00:23:37,831 --> 00:23:39,145
Did Clay tell you that?

377
00:23:39,265 --> 00:23:41,791
It's true: he was a friend,
and I'm a friend.

378
00:23:42,111 --> 00:23:43,861
Right, just like your dad.

379
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,903
You're just a chip off
the old spoon.

380
00:23:47,854 --> 00:23:51,518
Let's just hope we don't find you in
a ditch on a county road somewhere?

381
00:23:52,805 --> 00:23:54,700
Who do you think killed him?

382
00:23:55,974 --> 00:23:58,936
You know they found
three bullet holes in his head.

383
00:23:59,056 --> 00:24:02,611
Now, what could a mechanic do
that would incite such a gruesome death?

384
00:24:02,772 --> 00:24:06,555
- I don't know.
- He was buried with the enemy, Lowell.

385
00:24:07,452 --> 00:24:10,391
He was not a friend.
He did something to piss off Clay.

386
00:24:10,511 --> 00:24:11,511
No.

387
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,840
He was in the same grave
because he had the same killers.

388
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Use your head, Lowell.

389
00:24:17,232 --> 00:24:20,416
- Sam Crow killed your father.
- That is not true!

390
00:24:20,536 --> 00:24:21,581
Yes, it is.

391
00:24:22,422 --> 00:24:24,271
What's going on in here?

392
00:24:24,794 --> 00:24:26,015
Who the hell are you?

393
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:28,356
- ATF.
- Just what we need.

394
00:24:28,673 --> 00:24:32,140
- You guys want to rent a goddamn wing?
- Aren't you spunky.

395
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:34,767
You done with him?

396
00:24:35,931 --> 00:24:36,931
For now.

397
00:24:37,265 --> 00:24:38,898
Get out of here, Lowell.
Go ahead.

398
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,590
Go on.

399
00:24:46,344 --> 00:24:47,389
Pleasure.

400
00:24:50,905 --> 00:24:54,357
It's bad enough I got to see the other
one every time I get a hot shave.

401
00:24:54,477 --> 00:24:58,631
Now, I gotta deal with Mrs. ATF
chewing on my last nerve?

402
00:24:58,751 --> 00:25:02,714
- When did you last see Kohn?
- I just left him, at Floyd's.

403
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,020
- Who did this?
- ATF.

404
00:25:11,897 --> 00:25:12,897
Why?

405
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:14,183
Tara.

406
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:17,229
- That stupid bitch.
- How is this her fault?

407
00:25:20,988 --> 00:25:23,780
- This guy's dead.
- At least.

408
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:34,287
Yeah.
Kohn's still in town.

409
00:25:34,447 --> 00:25:37,046
I know. He's at Floyd's.
I'm taking care of it.

410
00:25:41,467 --> 00:25:44,911
I'm taking care of it.
I'm really going to miss this, Floyd.

411
00:25:53,842 --> 00:25:56,768
You want to go to war with me,
you sick piece of shit?

412
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:14,692
This is bullshit.

413
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:16,759
He attacked me.

414
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:19,129
No one backs your version, Kohn.

415
00:26:19,249 --> 00:26:20,975
He put me through a goddamn window.

416
00:26:21,095 --> 00:26:21,937
Right.

417
00:26:22,057 --> 00:26:24,906
Apparently after
you stabbed him with some scissors.

418
00:26:25,457 --> 00:26:26,448
No.

419
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:28,757
Don't think Jax is pressing charges.

420
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:31,467
Shit! Great!
Thank you.

421
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,022
But you will be facing
charges in Illinois

422
00:26:34,142 --> 00:26:36,260
for violating a restraining order.

423
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:41,518
I'm not stalking Tara.
I'm protecting her.

424
00:26:44,476 --> 00:26:45,310
Come on.

425
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:48,043
We all know what happens
if she hooks up with Teller.

426
00:26:48,163 --> 00:26:50,806
You know I'm right.
We're all on the same team here.

427
00:26:50,926 --> 00:26:52,052
No, Josh.

428
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:53,828
Not anymore.

429
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:56,802
You're in breach of about
a half dozen federal statutes.

430
00:26:56,922 --> 00:27:00,921
You've been stripped of your creds
and OPR is going to meet you at O'Hare.

431
00:27:01,183 --> 00:27:04,572
I hope that the stalk
was a good rush 'cause,

432
00:27:04,692 --> 00:27:06,129
it just killed your career.

433
00:27:08,445 --> 00:27:09,445
Wait.

434
00:27:14,653 --> 00:27:17,464
She came back here
because she was afraid of me.

435
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:20,128
I pointed her at Sam Crow.

436
00:27:21,461 --> 00:27:24,475
I can't fix that mistake,
but you can both of you can.

437
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:29,029
Please?

438
00:27:39,864 --> 00:27:42,322
Barber says you came in
for a haircut.

439
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:46,014
Agent Kohn attacked you
with a pair of scissors,

440
00:27:46,134 --> 00:27:49,197
so you pushed him
through a plate glass window.

441
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,383
Self-defense.

442
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:54,719
That's what Floyd saw.
I guess that's what happened.

443
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,118
That's fantastic.

444
00:28:05,624 --> 00:28:06,624
Tell me.

445
00:28:07,245 --> 00:28:09,337
Are they all just afraid of you

446
00:28:09,457 --> 00:28:12,107
or convinced
that you are a necessary evil?

447
00:28:12,564 --> 00:28:13,929
You charging me?

448
00:28:14,547 --> 00:28:15,672
No charges.

449
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,771
Why does Kohn have
a hard-on for you?

450
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:25,166
You know why.

451
00:28:26,053 --> 00:28:27,613
You're right, I do.

452
00:28:29,823 --> 00:28:30,973
Tara Knowles.

453
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:33,359
The charming ingenue.

454
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:36,467
- High school sweethearts, right?
- Yeah.

455
00:28:36,587 --> 00:28:38,320
She fears for her life,

456
00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:42,357
so she comes back home
to the only man

457
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:45,318
she knows loves her
enough to protect her.

458
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:48,189
A guy who would have no problem

459
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:51,001
putting a fed through
a plate glass window.

460
00:28:53,139 --> 00:28:54,445
That's beautiful.

461
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:55,977
Really, it is.

462
00:28:57,285 --> 00:28:59,905
I wish I had that kind
of pull for someone.

463
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:03,898
You're a lucky man.

464
00:29:05,418 --> 00:29:06,418
You done?

465
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,511
Yeah, she's done.

466
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,744
She's getting under his skin.

467
00:30:51,109 --> 00:30:53,551
I can feel it.
It's bad for us.

468
00:30:53,926 --> 00:30:55,676
I'm keeping an eye on him.

469
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:59,424
Not gonna let anything turn Jax
away from Sam Crow, especially pussy.

470
00:30:59,544 --> 00:31:02,245
Tara's not pussy.
He loved her.

471
00:31:03,026 --> 00:31:04,425
Probably still does.

472
00:31:09,528 --> 00:31:11,884
Neeta just called.
Lowell, MIA.

473
00:31:12,594 --> 00:31:15,802
She just found Moby in the apartment
crying, locked in the bathroom.

474
00:31:15,922 --> 00:31:16,922
Shit.

475
00:31:17,047 --> 00:31:19,745
Yeah, he probably went
to Lodi looking to score.

476
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,470
It's not your fault, baby.

477
00:31:28,885 --> 00:31:30,897
Been taking care
of Lowell since he's 16.

478
00:31:31,017 --> 00:31:33,171
You've done everything you could.

479
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,428
Just some shit you can't escape.

480
00:31:35,683 --> 00:31:37,408
It's like father, like son,

481
00:31:38,186 --> 00:31:40,820
- Yeah.
- It looks like it's going that way.

482
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,080
Gotta to rember what's important.

483
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,068
Big picture.

484
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:49,500
I'll call the Vista.
See if he checked in.

485
00:31:53,664 --> 00:31:56,414
No one blames you
if Lowell don't come home.

486
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,709
Come on, Lowell.
Open up. I'm taking you home.

487
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:09,279
It makes no sense.

488
00:32:09,944 --> 00:32:13,061
It's no sense that my dad
was buried with them wetbacks!

489
00:32:13,221 --> 00:32:15,820
How long have you been
taking care of me, Clay?

490
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,662
Why are you here now?

491
00:32:17,782 --> 00:32:19,426
I made a promise to your dad.

492
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:21,569
What, before you killed him?

493
00:32:22,168 --> 00:32:25,490
You killed him, Clay.
Why would you do that?

494
00:32:36,786 --> 00:32:38,245
I lied to you, son.

495
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:42,573
Don't you call me that.
I am not that.

496
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:45,948
Your father wasn't
killed by the enemy.

497
00:32:48,905 --> 00:32:52,223
- - He was the enemy.
- No. He was a friend.

498
00:32:52,343 --> 00:32:55,895
He was a loathsome piece of shit.
Treated you and your mother like dirt.

499
00:32:57,028 --> 00:33:00,978
Cared more about the crank than
he did about his friends, his family.

500
00:33:03,803 --> 00:33:06,590
- Sound familiar?
- I'm not that.

501
00:33:06,955 --> 00:33:07,955
No?

502
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:10,320
Then what the hell are you?

503
00:33:10,928 --> 00:33:12,580
You can't stay clean!

504
00:33:15,813 --> 00:33:17,415
You abandoned your kid.

505
00:33:17,827 --> 00:33:18,915
Moby.

506
00:33:19,584 --> 00:33:20,962
I killed your old man.

507
00:33:21,601 --> 00:33:23,700
I killed him 'cause he was a rat.

508
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,055
A weak, unkie rat.

509
00:33:26,175 --> 00:33:28,812
I'm not a rat.
Look at you.

510
00:33:29,803 --> 00:33:32,453
Ten minutes with Hale,
you turn inside out.

511
00:33:32,842 --> 00:33:34,042
You run away.

512
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:36,849
You don't give a shit
about your kid!

513
00:33:36,969 --> 00:33:38,247
I'm sorry, Clay.

514
00:33:38,997 --> 00:33:41,650
Next time maybe Moby
drowns in that bathtub.

515
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,152
Or maybe you tell Hale and the feds

516
00:33:44,312 --> 00:33:47,238
all those secrets you've been
hearing at Teller-Morrow.

517
00:33:48,724 --> 00:33:51,024
I can't deal with it anymore, Clay.

518
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:54,942
My point.

519
00:33:57,901 --> 00:33:58,901
Shit.

520
00:34:02,518 --> 00:34:03,929
I'm my old man.

521
00:34:07,734 --> 00:34:08,866
I'm Lowell.

522
00:34:11,461 --> 00:34:12,461
God.

523
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,969
I'm sorry, Clay.

524
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:21,575
I know that you tried to help me.
You help Moby.

525
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:23,880
You save him from me.

526
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,782
Do it!
Please.

527
00:34:28,704 --> 00:34:30,326
You help my little boy.

528
00:34:41,411 --> 00:34:43,128
This is it, prospect.
The final fight.

529
00:34:43,288 --> 00:34:45,200
- How you feeling?
- I'm good, man.

530
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,993
- This asshole looks half dead.
- Yeah, well, he's had a tougher climb.

531
00:34:49,113 --> 00:34:51,744
- It's a beautiful thing.
- It is a beautiful thing.

532
00:34:51,864 --> 00:34:54,779
You're looking like a champ.
Everybody's betting on you.

533
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:56,257
Except for us.

534
00:34:56,926 --> 00:34:58,643
What do you mean?

535
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:01,971
You want me to lose?

536
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:06,525
Come on, man. I can beat this guy.
I can win this whole thing.

537
00:35:06,686 --> 00:35:08,156
If you win this, we get 15 grand.

538
00:35:08,276 --> 00:35:11,404
You lose, we walk home with
ten times that much, so you lose.

539
00:35:11,524 --> 00:35:13,475
You're gonna take
a dive for the club.

540
00:35:13,595 --> 00:35:15,327
Go get him...
sort of.

541
00:35:31,438 --> 00:35:33,368
Why aren't you at the fight?

542
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:36,535
Had my share for today.

543
00:35:38,045 --> 00:35:39,045
Yeah.

544
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,311
Your leg okay?

545
00:35:42,202 --> 00:35:43,202
Yeah.

546
00:35:50,271 --> 00:35:53,312
- Where's the doctor?
- I don't know.

547
00:35:54,974 --> 00:35:57,202
Where you going with that, Jax?

548
00:35:57,472 --> 00:35:58,729
Nowhere.

549
00:35:59,084 --> 00:36:01,998
I don't believe that.
I've seen the two of you together,

550
00:36:02,511 --> 00:36:06,459
see how you act around her.
She's still got ties in you.

551
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:08,922
You know what?
I don't give a shit what you think.

552
00:36:09,082 --> 00:36:12,073
What I do, what Tara does...
It's not your business.

553
00:36:12,193 --> 00:36:15,442
No, cleaning up piss and broken cribs...
that's my business?

554
00:36:15,562 --> 00:36:17,712
No one asked you to take this on.

555
00:36:17,886 --> 00:36:19,558
This house, this kid.

556
00:36:20,204 --> 00:36:22,269
It's not your burden; it's mine.

557
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,238
Shit.

558
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,846
- You deal with that Lowell problem?
- Call Neeta.

559
00:36:56,564 --> 00:36:58,916
Tell her she's gonna be
watching Moby for a while.

560
00:36:59,036 --> 00:37:00,036
All right.

561
00:37:05,616 --> 00:37:08,048
Give it one more round.
Then he falls.

562
00:37:17,508 --> 00:37:18,988
I understand you...

563
00:37:19,892 --> 00:37:22,557
declined Bobby's
request for some comfort.

564
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,765
Yeah, I did.
I'm not about that anymore.

565
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:32,734
And if I was to ask
for some comfort...

566
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:35,967
would you be about that?

567
00:37:39,037 --> 00:37:40,037
No.

568
00:37:40,165 --> 00:37:44,058
Sorry, but your old lady
would turn us both into chum.

569
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:47,348
You make a good point.

570
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:53,533
If, Half-Sack patches in,

571
00:37:53,653 --> 00:37:55,787
which is a big if,

572
00:37:57,014 --> 00:37:59,115
it's all right with me
if you stick around.

573
00:38:01,444 --> 00:38:04,411
That is, if he wants
you as his old lady.

574
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:10,461
Shit!

575
00:38:11,911 --> 00:38:13,171
Half-Sack, don't!

576
00:38:14,457 --> 00:38:15,866
What's he doing?

577
00:38:19,158 --> 00:38:20,910
What is he doing? 

578
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,384
Gonna KO this guy.

579
00:38:23,665 --> 00:38:25,767
Shit, I'll kill him.
I'm gonna kill him.

580
00:38:25,927 --> 00:38:27,769
No, no, no.
My bad. My bad.

581
00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:30,605
Get him out of there
before we got to bury another Mexican.

582
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:33,650
Come on.

583
00:38:34,301 --> 00:38:36,946
Hey,*** relax

584
00:38:46,563 --> 00:38:49,655
Clay, I'm really sorry.
You know, I just lost it... I'm

585
00:38:49,775 --> 00:38:51,791
You owe the club 35K.

586
00:38:52,805 --> 00:38:54,263
- Really?
- Yeah.

587
00:38:54,873 --> 00:38:56,673
At least you got the girl?

588
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:59,660
Go on, get out of here
before I rape both of you.

589
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,687
- Ick. Hey!
- Come on, come on.

590
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:04,514
It's just an expression.
A term of endearment.

591
00:39:06,247 --> 00:39:08,968
We're gonna need the 115 by Friday.

592
00:39:09,404 --> 00:39:11,068
It's gonna be a busy week.

593
00:39:11,188 --> 00:39:12,282
You said it.

594
00:39:19,872 --> 00:39:21,297
He's a good mechanic.

595
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:35,189
Jesus, are you okay?

596
00:39:35,947 --> 00:39:36,947
Yeah.

597
00:39:38,341 --> 00:39:40,039
Hale told me what happened.

598
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:45,653
Kohn's gone.
I watched him leave town.

599
00:39:51,645 --> 00:39:52,664
Thank you.

600
00:39:59,127 --> 00:40:00,220
What is it?

601
00:40:03,716 --> 00:40:07,577
You left Chicago 'cause you were afraid
this guy was gonna hurt you?

602
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,000
One of the reasons.

603
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:15,182
Did you come back here
'cause you knew I would hurt this guy?

604
00:40:15,302 --> 00:40:17,977
- Do what the cops wouldn't do?
- God, no.

605
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,108
And I had no idea
he would follow me.

606
00:40:22,822 --> 00:40:25,136
I didn't know
you'd even still be here.

607
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:32,847
That doesn't sound like you, Jax.

608
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,039
Sounds like your mother.

609
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,122
Well, you're safe now.

610
00:40:56,026 --> 00:40:57,404
How'd it go, baby?

611
00:41:04,747 --> 00:41:05,874
Where is he?

612
00:41:07,813 --> 00:41:09,587
Sam Crow rehab.

613
00:41:14,761 --> 00:41:16,301
What did you tell Jax?

614
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:18,661
About the bodies?

615
00:41:21,376 --> 00:41:22,716
Some of the truth.

616
00:41:24,662 --> 00:41:25,736
And Lowell?

617
00:41:28,898 --> 00:41:30,165
A little more.

618
00:41:35,335 --> 00:41:36,935
The rest stays buried.

619
00:41:40,213 --> 00:41:41,213
Yeah.

620
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,138
It rests in peace.

621
00:41:59,766 --> 00:42:04,611
