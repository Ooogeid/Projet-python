00:00:01,977 --> 00:00:03,851
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:03,976 --> 00:00:06,631
My daughter's still in shock.
Asshole threw her down on the dirt,

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,258
- raped her.
- I am so sorry that happened to you.

4
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,594
Don't worry, baby.
It's going to be okay.

5
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,220
You're one of Luann's girls.

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,264
You can call me.

7
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,635
This is Clay's club.
You gotta back down,

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,147
get in line before
somebody gets hurt.

9
00:00:25,232 --> 00:00:26,150
Shit!

10
00:00:32,393 --> 00:00:33,491
This was Zobelle.

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,660
Clay'll go at Zobelle full-bore.

12
00:00:35,897 --> 00:00:38,663
I got a bad feeling we'll be walking
right into a trap.

13
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:41,791
They think they know where Zobelle is.
Christian Center in Morada.

14
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,809
AKs and shotguns. Let's go.

15
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,467
Drop the guns! Now!

16
00:01:03,425 --> 00:01:04,290
Holy shit.

17
00:01:31,765 --> 00:01:34,927
Aryans put out the word,
us white boys are on our own.

18
00:01:35,506 --> 00:01:37,956
Zobelle tapping into
the shot-callers.

19
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:49,859
Rosen thinks the case
is being tied up.

20
00:01:50,828 --> 00:01:53,279
Be a while
before it sees a courtroom.

21
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:56,198
Without a color crew,
we ain't gonna make it to trial.

22
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:01,371
This herd could use
a little thinning.

23
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:03,956
It's not his fault we're here.

24
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,448
So, what, it's mine?

25
00:02:05,573 --> 00:02:07,023
We all voted on it.

26
00:02:09,843 --> 00:02:12,343
I'm working on getting us
some friends.

27
00:02:13,362 --> 00:02:14,588
They're jamming us.

28
00:02:14,713 --> 00:02:17,715
Seven-figure bail,
no court date, it's bullshit.

29
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,140
Apparently they have security tapes.

30
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:23,203
Women and children
running for their lives.

31
00:02:23,328 --> 00:02:24,891
You saw what happened to Otto.

32
00:02:25,016 --> 00:02:26,520
They've got no protection.

33
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,201
- I know.
- What about a bondsman?

34
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:31,376
500,000 a head, at ten percent,

35
00:02:31,893 --> 00:02:34,593
you'd need 300k to get
the six of them out.

36
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,906
I can post the house.

37
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,153
My dad's, too.

38
00:02:40,045 --> 00:02:41,827
That's enough to get out Clay.

39
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,509
Maybe Jax.

40
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:44,959
That's it.

41
00:02:48,222 --> 00:02:49,877
Clay won't leave 'em behind.

42
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:51,552
I'm sorry, Gemma.

43
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,391
Clay needs you to call Laroy,

44
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:58,558
deliver this message, asap.

45
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,663
I never saw it.
Never gave it to you.

46
00:03:10,013 --> 00:03:11,613
You can use my office.

47
00:03:13,454 --> 00:03:15,861
If you need unis,
I'll call in an extra shift.

48
00:03:16,452 --> 00:03:18,902
You have any interest
in why I'm here?

49
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,240
Not really.

50
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:23,494
Who do I brief?

51
00:03:25,354 --> 00:03:26,804
Commanding officer.

52
00:03:34,693 --> 00:03:38,082
- League of American Nationalists.
- I know who they are.

53
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:39,767
Cameron and Edmond Hayes.

54
00:03:39,892 --> 00:03:42,054
True IRA.
That's the reason I'm here.

55
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:45,203
Same reason Zobelle is.
He wants their guns.

56
00:03:45,328 --> 00:03:46,934
His crew is pushing out the MC.

57
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,949
So, pick up Zobelle,

58
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:51,647
and squeeze him for the Irish.

59
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,812
FBI's working a case
on the separatist group,

60
00:03:53,937 --> 00:03:57,665
Zobelle is on their radar.
So, for now, he's off-limits to us.

61
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,105
Same bureaucratic bullshit, huh?

62
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:06,616
I have no interest in creating
any collateral damage

63
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:08,359
in your town, David.

64
00:04:09,578 --> 00:04:12,128
I've already done
my fair share of that.

65
00:04:13,205 --> 00:04:16,955
So, any intel that you could offer
would be greatly appreciated.

66
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:20,471
I don't know anything about the IRA,

67
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:24,805
but Zobelle is responsible
for the car bombing at Teller-Morrow.

68
00:04:29,487 --> 00:04:32,437
Looks like the retaliation backfired,
didn't it?

69
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:35,256
Jax tried to prevent that.

70
00:04:36,077 --> 00:04:39,877
We tried to scoop up Zobelle
before Clay went in loaded for bear.

71
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:42,364
So, the VP's working
behind Clay's back?

72
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:47,751
Jax may have some suspicions
about what happened

73
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,530
to Donna Winston.

74
00:04:54,765 --> 00:04:57,115
It's a good thing
Opie didn't get picked up.

75
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,540
How is he doing?

76
00:05:00,452 --> 00:05:01,602
I don't know.

77
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:03,902
You should ask him.

78
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:22,154
Why aren't they at school?

79
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:23,614
Grading day.

80
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,741
You get my message?

81
00:05:27,017 --> 00:05:29,508
It's been crazy here
with everybody gone.

82
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:32,456
Gonna head up to the cabin,
make sure Piney's not dead.

83
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:35,918
Means you're actually
gonna have to be a father today.

84
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,170
I'll handle it.

85
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:45,091
The old man's fine.

86
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:46,428
You know how he gets.

87
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:56,349
You behave for your pop.

88
00:05:58,637 --> 00:05:59,837
Love you both.

89
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:01,878
Love you too, grandma.

90
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:18,752
Let him through.

91
00:06:20,793 --> 00:06:22,193
Russell's waitin'.

92
00:06:28,394 --> 00:06:30,723
Understand
y'all got safety concerns.

93
00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:34,601
Just a bunch of short timers
looking for some friends.

94
00:06:34,955 --> 00:06:36,955
Monumental times, my brothers.

95
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:39,219
Black man in the White House.

96
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:41,879
Black saving white in the big house.

97
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,575
My cousin says you're dependable.

98
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:52,349
I been working
with Laroy a long time.

99
00:06:53,017 --> 00:06:54,509
Peckerwoods are flexing,

100
00:06:54,634 --> 00:06:56,248
protection ain't gonna come easy.

101
00:06:56,561 --> 00:06:57,784
What's the price?

102
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:00,964
Had a couple of affiliated friends
fall from grace.

103
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:02,639
Ratted out my nephew.

104
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:04,506
Need y'all to deliver 'em to me.

105
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:09,803
That bitch over in there,
in protective custody.

106
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,929
Dion likes buff brown boys.

107
00:07:15,328 --> 00:07:17,312
Noticed you got yourself
one of them.

108
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,537
Yeah, we do.

109
00:07:19,392 --> 00:07:21,440
- And the other rat?
- Vincent Bell,

110
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,010
tranny dealer,

111
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:25,958
t-girl's gone awol
somewhere in Stockton.

112
00:07:26,365 --> 00:07:30,082
I'm gonna need some time
to reach outside.

113
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:36,997
So, we do this,

114
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:39,792
- black got our back.
- When they're both delivered,

115
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:43,128
Harleys gettin' all kinds of love
from the family.

116
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,443
Minutes are limited.

117
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,052
Reach out wisely.

118
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,972
Can you hear me now?

Episode 207: Gilead

130
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:45,965
- Where's grandma?
- She went to go find grandpa.

131
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:54,221
That was Clay.

132
00:08:55,094 --> 00:08:55,993
On the cell?

133
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:58,693
He needs me to run an errand.

134
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,320
It's gonna take a while.

135
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,071
I'll have Neeta take Kenny and Ellie,
and I'll just go grab the baby.

136
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:06,679
Pick 'em up at Jax's?

137
00:09:06,804 --> 00:09:08,654
Is there anything I can do?

138
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,910
Not right now.

139
00:09:16,746 --> 00:09:19,975
I put Opie on the tranny snitch.
He gonna use Trammel to set her up.

140
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,751
- Opie's doing it alone?
- We're all a little busy.

141
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:24,626
Then tap another charter.

142
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,956
- Why don't you get Hale to help.
- All right.

143
00:09:29,055 --> 00:09:30,805
What about the other one?

144
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,120
He's over there in PC.

145
00:09:33,245 --> 00:09:35,745
He's got a thing
for Puerto Rican wood.

146
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,167
Juice bait?

147
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:40,954
We gotta lure Dion to someplace
Russell's crew can get to him.

148
00:09:41,432 --> 00:09:42,432
Set it up.

149
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,751
I'll let our black daddies know
it's all in motion.

150
00:09:53,322 --> 00:09:56,470
- Must be lonely up there, huh?
- I know you, blondie?

151
00:09:57,385 --> 00:09:58,735
New on the block.

152
00:10:02,306 --> 00:10:03,185
Smoke?

153
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:04,645
Thanks.

154
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:12,193
Dion get you anything you need,
Clay.

155
00:10:14,227 --> 00:10:15,677
That face and body,

156
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,283
gets you a lot of store credit.

157
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:21,165
Appreciate the offer, man, but...

158
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,840
I belong to him.
Fat guy with the beard.

159
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,858
No accounting for taste.

160
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,670
Got other revenue.

161
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:31,531
Short, pretty one.

162
00:10:32,603 --> 00:10:33,853
Stupid haircut.

163
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:36,744
Absolutely doable, man.

164
00:10:37,227 --> 00:10:38,227
50 credit.

165
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
30.

166
00:10:39,645 --> 00:10:41,045
Need a test drive.

167
00:10:45,469 --> 00:10:47,062
I'll make sure he's tuned up.

168
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,439
- Where?
- Infirmary.

169
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:58,925
Name's Vincent Bell, aka Venus.

170
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,478
He's a tranny dealer.

171
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,329
Need you to track down the he-she.
I'll take it from there.

172
00:11:04,787 --> 00:11:06,456
This is direct from Clay.

173
00:11:08,505 --> 00:11:09,986
Just plant it in the car.

174
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:12,043
All right?
I don't need a warrant for that.

175
00:11:12,168 --> 00:11:13,839
Put it under the driver's seat.

176
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:15,551
And don't skimp on the dope.

177
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:18,176
I need a lot more than a misdemeanor
to get him into county.

178
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:19,355
Cool.

179
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,740
Up. Just get it off the bench.

180
00:11:38,951 --> 00:11:40,615
How you doing, beautiful?

181
00:11:42,873 --> 00:11:43,688
What?

182
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,123
We need you
to take one for the club.

183
00:11:48,848 --> 00:11:49,648
Shit.

184
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,476
Snitch over there finds you
very appealing.

185
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,257
Got to get him out of PC
for the family.

186
00:11:57,729 --> 00:11:58,865
Buys us protection.

187
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:01,386
Get him out how?

188
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,892
Come on. Are you serious?

189
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,353
Nothing's going to happen.
You're just bait.

190
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,396
Black'll jump in before he bites.

191
00:12:11,988 --> 00:12:12,856
We hope.

192
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,484
50-50 chance you wind up
with no dick up your ass.

193
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,778
I arranged a meet
at the PC infirmary.

194
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:20,855
You got to distract Dion,
unlock the guard gate,

195
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,075
let in Russell's crew.
It'll be a piece of cake.

196
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:25,619
How do I get there?

197
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,080
Guard!

198
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,461
Jesus Christ,
I think you cracked my rib.

199
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:32,542
I know.
Sorry.

200
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,011
- Where's Lyla?
- She's right over there.

201
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,710
I got your message.

202
00:12:51,384 --> 00:12:52,437
What do you need?

203
00:12:55,882 --> 00:12:57,382
I saw the coke vials

204
00:12:57,755 --> 00:12:59,653
when I was working on your car.

205
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:05,642
I need to ask a favor.

206
00:13:06,043 --> 00:13:07,228
Call your dealer,

207
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,355
ask him to make a delivery.
Half an ounce.

208
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,030
That's a lot of blow.

209
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:12,816
What's it for?

210
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,142
To help the club.

211
00:13:16,636 --> 00:13:18,436
That's all I can tell you.

212
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:20,168
Shit.

213
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:23,381
Angus is an asshole.

214
00:13:23,978 --> 00:13:26,471
Every time he makes a drop,
he won't leave till I blow him.

215
00:13:26,729 --> 00:13:29,683
So I guess you wouldn't be too upset
if he never came back.

216
00:13:31,123 --> 00:13:32,473
Should I ask why?

217
00:13:34,956 --> 00:13:35,956
Look,

218
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:37,692
you don't know me.

219
00:13:38,353 --> 00:13:40,953
I'm sorry for coming up
on you like this,

220
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:43,453
but I'm up against it here.

221
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:45,719
I need your help

222
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:48,577
and I promise
that it won't blow back on you.

223
00:14:36,264 --> 00:14:37,464
How you doing?

224
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:39,631
Juice.

225
00:14:44,345 --> 00:14:45,654
- Yes, you are.
- Right.

226
00:14:49,216 --> 00:14:50,416
Come prepared.

227
00:14:51,311 --> 00:14:53,061
I like to be responsible.

228
00:14:53,436 --> 00:14:54,587
Good for you, Juicy.

229
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,754
This is a lot nicer than gen pop.

230
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,192
A little more intimate.

231
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,091
That, too, yeah.

232
00:15:05,803 --> 00:15:06,903
Have a seat.

233
00:15:20,498 --> 00:15:22,798
- You sore, baby?
- Yeah, a little.

234
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,294
- Don't be nervous, sweetheart.
- I'm not.

235
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:30,469
I'm just...

236
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:34,267
You mind if we move this
to the bathroom?

237
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,153
- A little more private.
- Sure, baby.

238
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:37,578
I'm sort of shy.

239
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:40,276
Like to get down to business.

240
00:15:52,402 --> 00:15:54,952
Just let me grab
the condoms real quick.

241
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:08,717
Come on, honey. Let's get this done!

242
00:16:09,175 --> 00:16:10,260
We're coming.

243
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:12,649
Shit.

244
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:16,467
Thanks.

245
00:16:17,827 --> 00:16:19,811
Guessing you won't be needing these?

246
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:32,875
He's smiling.

247
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,150
Maybe he did take one up the ass.

248
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,753
That's one down.

249
00:16:40,878 --> 00:16:43,627
Just need Ope to come through.
Then we got protection.

250
00:16:50,614 --> 00:16:52,052
Shit, it's going down!

251
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
Guard!

252
00:18:09,842 --> 00:18:11,092
Hi, sweetheart.

253
00:18:11,332 --> 00:18:12,732
Is this your baby?

254
00:18:14,285 --> 00:18:15,385
I'm grandma.

255
00:18:15,614 --> 00:18:17,158
I'll meet you out front, trissy.

256
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:24,978
She sings beautiful.

257
00:18:25,382 --> 00:18:27,188
I'm gonna be out of town
for the recital.

258
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,281
Trying to catch some rehearsals.

259
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:30,806
You're a good dad.

260
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:34,696
How's she doing?

261
00:18:36,253 --> 00:18:38,253
Dealing with the rape and all?

262
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:43,229
Therapy's been helping a lot.
She's starting to talk about it.

263
00:18:44,043 --> 00:18:45,143
That's good.

264
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:51,827
I heard about Clay.

265
00:18:58,296 --> 00:19:00,869
Your office told me you were here.

266
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,185
Didn't know who else to go to.

267
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:12,835
Maybe it's time for a lesson, Gemma,

268
00:19:13,158 --> 00:19:14,358
for all of us.

269
00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:17,339
Maybe.

270
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:20,987
But this isn't it.

271
00:19:23,124 --> 00:19:25,111
Zobelle set up that bust.

272
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:28,115
He's ripping apart the club.

273
00:19:28,424 --> 00:19:30,324
He's ripping apart charming.

274
00:19:33,232 --> 00:19:37,179
Clay outed Jacob Hale's bullshit scam,
saved your land.

275
00:19:39,107 --> 00:19:40,257
Thought maybe

276
00:19:40,936 --> 00:19:42,988
you'd like to return the favor.

277
00:19:44,914 --> 00:19:46,320
How big a favor?

278
00:19:47,543 --> 00:19:50,806
- 300 against three mil.
- Jesus Christ.

279
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:56,629
I'd have to put up the same land
for that kind of bail.

280
00:19:56,856 --> 00:19:59,280
One infraction, one guy splits,
I lose it all.

281
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,198
- I lose it all.
- They're not safe, Elliot.

282
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,229
If I don't get them out of there,
I might not see any of them again.

283
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:27,858
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:38,258 --> 00:20:39,628
Jesus Christ.

285
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,360
I've been waiting
ten goddamn minutes.

286
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:43,658
Sorry.

287
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:47,954
Let's go inside.

288
00:20:51,492 --> 00:20:53,642
- Shit.
- What the hell is this?

289
00:20:54,081 --> 00:20:55,837
- Luann hired security.
- Get inside.

290
00:20:57,473 --> 00:20:58,723
Relax, Hot Dog.

291
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,295
Call this your harassment fine.

292
00:21:09,941 --> 00:21:11,519
You stupid bitch!

293
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,272
Another word and I blow
your Jap head off.

294
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,723
- I'm Chinese.
- You're gone.

295
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:18,763
We'll see.

296
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:37,188
Are you okay?

297
00:21:44,075 --> 00:21:45,718
I'm just a little sad.

298
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:49,948
Are you baptizing him?

299
00:21:50,073 --> 00:21:51,684
Thought did cross my mind.

300
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:55,169
Figured he could use
all the help he can get.

301
00:21:57,568 --> 00:21:59,268
Not sure what I'm doing.

302
00:22:00,437 --> 00:22:01,437
Here.

303
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,745
That's it?

304
00:22:10,876 --> 00:22:12,016
I think so.

305
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,050
Thanks.

306
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,620
Come on back here.

307
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,461
Why are you so sad?

308
00:22:32,595 --> 00:22:35,228
My son and my husband

309
00:22:36,336 --> 00:22:37,486
got arrested.

310
00:22:40,104 --> 00:22:41,104
Guess I...

311
00:22:42,036 --> 00:22:44,158
I just don't like being alone.

312
00:22:44,428 --> 00:22:46,663
And that's why you came to my dad.

313
00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:48,116
Money to get them out?

314
00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:52,370
You're a smart girl.

315
00:22:56,894 --> 00:22:58,953
You seem happy, baby.

316
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,000
Come on, sweetheart.

317
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:09,929
Thank you.

318
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:12,637
You're welcome.

319
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:28,256
Thanks, man.

320
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:34,038
Shank missed the vitals.
Juice is going to live.

321
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,213
Good, good.

322
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,952
Let's hope we're all that lucky.

323
00:23:37,077 --> 00:23:39,327
The first part of the deal is done.

324
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:42,994
Opie will come through.
He's on his way to Stockton right now.

325
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,871
We should have protection
before morning.

326
00:23:44,996 --> 00:23:47,383
Let's just hope
Opie's not here with us.

327
00:23:47,722 --> 00:23:49,161
Yeah, or dead.

328
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,250
Shit!

329
00:25:54,237 --> 00:25:55,237
Goddamn...

330
00:25:55,464 --> 00:25:57,272
Shit, man, I'm sorry.

331
00:25:57,397 --> 00:25:59,416
I guess that bitch
didn't want to be set up.

332
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:01,791
- What do I do?
- Get on my radio.

333
00:26:03,148 --> 00:26:04,445
"Officer down."

334
00:26:05,013 --> 00:26:06,013
All right.

335
00:26:10,521 --> 00:26:12,153
Officer down.

336
00:26:24,428 --> 00:26:26,404
Probably smells like pussy.

337
00:26:28,566 --> 00:26:29,566
Thanks.

338
00:26:32,036 --> 00:26:33,036
You okay?

339
00:26:45,585 --> 00:26:47,438
Thanks for not asking questions.

340
00:26:50,664 --> 00:26:53,194
I gotta get going, pick up my kid.

341
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:55,238
Shit.

342
00:26:55,719 --> 00:26:57,422
Gotta pick up mine, too.

343
00:26:59,621 --> 00:27:02,410
I was going to take Piper
to get something to eat.

344
00:27:02,535 --> 00:27:03,985
Your kids can come.

345
00:27:04,816 --> 00:27:06,707
Pick them up at my place later.

346
00:27:07,464 --> 00:27:08,764
No, that's okay.

347
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:10,875
Look,

348
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:13,431
I don't know what happened...

349
00:27:15,995 --> 00:27:19,845
But maybe this isn't the best time
for you to be around your kids.

350
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:25,774
There's never a good time
for me to be around my kids.

351
00:27:28,764 --> 00:27:30,271
I know the feeling.

352
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,213
Setup on the tranny went south.

353
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:49,022
Bitch got away.
Trammel took a bullet.

354
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:50,852
Belly wound.

355
00:27:51,082 --> 00:27:52,582
Is Opie okay?

356
00:27:59,224 --> 00:28:00,970
You got to talk to Russell.

357
00:28:01,251 --> 00:28:03,951
Maybe getting Dion buys us
some protection.

358
00:28:06,038 --> 00:28:07,184
Come with us.

359
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,312
- What for?
- No idea. Let's go.

360
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:18,217
I ain't ever seen us
beat up this bad.

361
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:21,365
Half our crew in hospital beds.

362
00:28:21,714 --> 00:28:24,664
The med bills alone...
They're going to bury us.

363
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:30,772
We got to fix the things we can.

364
00:28:32,968 --> 00:28:34,337
You and Clay...

365
00:28:34,894 --> 00:28:36,262
Whatever it is,

366
00:28:36,642 --> 00:28:39,342
it's going to land on you
to make it right.

367
00:28:42,939 --> 00:28:44,439
What makes you think

368
00:28:44,652 --> 00:28:46,252
this would land on me?

369
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:50,075
Because Clay is old, he's mean,

370
00:28:50,421 --> 00:28:53,671
and he is never going to admit
that he made a mistake.

371
00:28:56,978 --> 00:28:58,528
And he's earned that.

372
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,740
Time don't mean shit.

373
00:29:05,531 --> 00:29:07,979
I'm doing the best I can
to hold us together

374
00:29:08,104 --> 00:29:11,019
but if this split gets any worse...

375
00:29:12,743 --> 00:29:14,993
I'm going to have to pick a corner.

376
00:29:21,996 --> 00:29:23,679
You know, this club

377
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,320
needs a healing, brother.

378
00:29:28,379 --> 00:29:30,929
And you got to be
the one to deliver it.

379
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,585
I'm here to pick up Opie's kids.

380
00:29:56,993 --> 00:29:59,073
- I'm Lyla.
- I know who you are.

381
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:00,398
Where is Opie?

382
00:30:01,205 --> 00:30:03,342
He's doing something for the club.

383
00:30:04,173 --> 00:30:06,573
Porn girl's here
for Kenny and Ellie.

384
00:30:07,078 --> 00:30:08,478
You're kidding me.

385
00:30:10,988 --> 00:30:13,236
I got to pick up my kid at my mom's.

386
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:15,771
Told Opie I'd take them all
for something to eat.

387
00:30:16,376 --> 00:30:17,876
We already fed them.

388
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,798
- I'm just trying to help Opie.
- We don't know you.

389
00:30:26,923 --> 00:30:29,409
We're not about
to turn two kids over to some...

390
00:30:29,534 --> 00:30:32,455
Some hottie your boyfriend
jerks off to?

391
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,603
My guy's not into the underdeveloped
tween thing.

392
00:30:38,135 --> 00:30:40,504
Why don't you go
pick up your own kid.

393
00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:43,836
We'll tell Opie there's been
a change of plans.

394
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:45,531
Come on.

395
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,990
Is he out of his goddamn mind?

396
00:31:03,716 --> 00:31:05,986
Perfect ending to a shitty day.

397
00:31:06,918 --> 00:31:08,866
Lot of shitty days
since we last talked.

398
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:12,554
Otto loses another eye...
Car bombs...

399
00:31:13,443 --> 00:31:14,997
Assaulting christians.

400
00:31:15,838 --> 00:31:19,056
I get the sense that you
are losing control, Clay.

401
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:21,701
Which might explain

402
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:24,226
why Ethan Zobelle

403
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,850
is stealing

404
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,900
your gun source.

405
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:42,639
Zobelle attacked Otto,

406
00:31:43,231 --> 00:31:44,581
planted the bomb,

407
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:47,895
and he is now going
after your livelihood, Clay.

408
00:31:48,551 --> 00:31:50,436
He's unraveling the club.

409
00:31:52,684 --> 00:31:54,834
You can stop that from happening.

410
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,539
Let me have the IRA.

411
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,569
They've already sold you out,
so you don't lose anything.

412
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:07,515
And no guns means that Zobelle
and his aryan crew

413
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,231
have no reason to be in Charming.

414
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:15,119
Let me make this arrest go away,

415
00:32:16,146 --> 00:32:18,700
and everything returns to normal.

416
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:24,102
Only IRA I work with is the one
my accountant feeds at tax time.

417
00:32:32,678 --> 00:32:34,182
How are the hands?

418
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:38,498
I watched my dad
go through the same thing.

419
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:40,449
Painful shit.

420
00:32:43,557 --> 00:32:46,088
How long do you think you have?

421
00:32:46,918 --> 00:32:48,476
I know the rules.

422
00:32:48,601 --> 00:32:49,716
Can't ride,

423
00:32:50,196 --> 00:32:51,302
can't lead.

424
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,580
How long did your daddy last?

425
00:32:54,152 --> 00:32:55,852
Seeing how you hate men,

426
00:32:56,876 --> 00:32:58,765
I'm guessing he rubbed
those sore hands up

427
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,586
and down your fine-ass body
for a long time.

428
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:14,843
I guess I really should speak

429
00:33:15,334 --> 00:33:16,577
with the heir apparent.

430
00:33:18,517 --> 00:33:22,521
Seems that Jax has
a better grasp on the big picture.

431
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:25,274
I know that he was working with Hale

432
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:28,675
to get to Zobelle
before you did something stupid.

433
00:33:29,642 --> 00:33:31,550
Like attack
a christian family dinner.

434
00:33:32,947 --> 00:33:34,857
You talk to whoever
the hell you want to.

435
00:33:34,982 --> 00:33:37,582
You ain't get nothing
but the same truth.

436
00:33:38,171 --> 00:33:39,671
You sure about that?

437
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:43,315
Hale tells me that things
have been a little

438
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,690
tense between you and your stepson.

439
00:33:47,305 --> 00:33:50,055
Since Jax figured out
that you killed Donna.

440
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,792
Let's go, Teller.

441
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,840
Come on.

442
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:23,894
They need this.

443
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,277
Tried calling.
No one answered.

444
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,982
We're a little shorthanded.

445
00:36:29,351 --> 00:36:30,854
What's going on?

446
00:36:32,352 --> 00:36:36,102
How long do you think we can keep
charming the way it is, Gemma?

447
00:36:37,379 --> 00:36:38,544
I don't know.

448
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:41,508
Everything caves
under the weight of greed.

449
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:43,233
Seen it my whole life.

450
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:48,609
Nothing stays simple.

451
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,984
Guess that's true.

452
00:36:54,432 --> 00:36:55,504
I called Rosen.

453
00:36:56,104 --> 00:36:57,965
Posted bail a few hours ago.

454
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,133
My god.

455
00:37:00,341 --> 00:37:03,470
Promise to keep them
out of trouble until after the trial.

456
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:07,432
I'll chain 'em
to the auto lifts if I have to.

457
00:37:12,234 --> 00:37:13,634
Thank you, Elliot.

458
00:37:15,512 --> 00:37:16,858
Thank Tristen.

459
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:19,745
Good night.

460
00:37:23,635 --> 00:37:25,085
You guys, let's go.

461
00:37:26,564 --> 00:37:28,133
- Thank Tara.
- Thank you, Tara.

462
00:37:28,258 --> 00:37:30,089
- You're welcome.
- Thank you, Tara.

463
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:32,864
- You're welcome.
- Kids, wait in the car.

464
00:37:38,864 --> 00:37:40,486
They're good kids.

465
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,957
Look, I'm sorry
about the Lyla thing.

466
00:37:44,755 --> 00:37:47,605
I wouldn't have done it
if I didn't trust her.

467
00:37:47,758 --> 00:37:49,758
Guess we made a judgment call.

468
00:37:50,507 --> 00:37:54,511
- Maybe you weren't thinking clearly.
- That sounds like a judgment call.

469
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:58,716
- She's a porn star.
- She's a single mom.

470
00:37:59,005 --> 00:38:01,445
She's just trying to make
it work like the rest of us.

471
00:38:07,124 --> 00:38:08,824
How's Jax doing with it?

472
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,193
He's figuring it out.

473
00:38:12,033 --> 00:38:13,933
Good he has you to help him.

474
00:38:15,548 --> 00:38:17,298
You'll find someone, Ope.

475
00:38:18,051 --> 00:38:19,129
Time is right,

476
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,250
it'll happen.

477
00:38:21,489 --> 00:38:22,883
I went by my place.

478
00:38:23,746 --> 00:38:26,011
All of Mary's shit is gone.
She split.

479
00:38:26,736 --> 00:38:27,801
I'm sorry.

480
00:38:28,286 --> 00:38:30,536
She couldn't be a mom 20 years ago.

481
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:32,138
Can't do it now.

482
00:38:34,973 --> 00:38:36,723
We'll help with the kids.

483
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,649
You're not alone, Ope.

484
00:38:45,605 --> 00:38:46,605
I am.

485
00:38:47,064 --> 00:38:48,114
Good night.

486
00:38:52,462 --> 00:38:55,415
I know you want
the MC on a better path.

487
00:38:56,059 --> 00:38:59,628
Put some distance between
the law and the harleys.

488
00:39:00,782 --> 00:39:03,182
Legit porn business
is proof of that.

489
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:05,550
It's real smart, Jax.

490
00:39:06,422 --> 00:39:10,283
My guess is that you don't even
want to be dealing guns.

491
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,476
I'm not after sam crow.

492
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:19,958
I want Cameron
Hayes's true IRA contacts.

493
00:39:21,006 --> 00:39:22,284
Consider it

494
00:39:23,014 --> 00:39:26,450
retaliation for the Mick assholes
jumping ship.

495
00:39:28,186 --> 00:39:30,242
And we both know that you'll never

496
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,517
win this war against Zobelle.

497
00:39:34,552 --> 00:39:35,902
I'm not in a war.

498
00:39:36,812 --> 00:39:39,012
You look pretty battle-worn to me.

499
00:39:41,789 --> 00:39:45,257
Look, I don't give a shit about
this beef between you and Clay.

500
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:47,966
Your club, your business.

501
00:39:50,647 --> 00:39:53,661
But maybe I can help
you repair the damage,

502
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:56,101
very least keep you alive.

503
00:39:58,399 --> 00:40:01,860
How long do you think you're gonna
last out there on the yard?

504
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:05,989
They will pick you off, one by one,
same way they did Juice.

505
00:40:07,982 --> 00:40:09,782
Then get us a decent bail.

506
00:40:11,288 --> 00:40:13,038
I'll do better than that.

507
00:40:14,087 --> 00:40:16,672
You give me inroads to the Irish,

508
00:40:16,889 --> 00:40:20,102
I'll get you
and the club full immunity.

509
00:40:20,492 --> 00:40:23,253
I might even be able
to get Otto's parole back on track.

510
00:40:33,038 --> 00:40:35,166
You have to think past

511
00:40:35,686 --> 00:40:37,136
your hatred for me.

512
00:40:39,613 --> 00:40:41,363
You're smarter than that.

513
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:45,734
I am offering you

514
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,252
a bigger picture.

515
00:40:49,778 --> 00:40:51,378
You have a great girl,

516
00:40:52,636 --> 00:40:54,430
a beautiful son.

517
00:40:55,492 --> 00:40:57,642
I know how much they mean to you.

518
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,777
My son... he's given me...

519
00:41:08,741 --> 00:41:10,667
A new pair of glasses.

520
00:41:14,209 --> 00:41:15,552
Find myself

521
00:41:16,819 --> 00:41:18,869
thinking about the things I do,

522
00:41:19,074 --> 00:41:20,391
things I say.

523
00:41:22,114 --> 00:41:23,855
Ramifications.

524
00:41:24,646 --> 00:41:25,746
You have to.

525
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:28,123
Not as angry or

526
00:41:28,456 --> 00:41:29,569
reactive.

527
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:30,987
I can see that.

528
00:41:32,232 --> 00:41:34,882
For instance,
you showing me these photos,

529
00:41:36,631 --> 00:41:39,134
trying to play my rage,

530
00:41:39,493 --> 00:41:41,277
my need for revenge.

531
00:41:42,443 --> 00:41:43,700
It didn't work.

532
00:41:45,929 --> 00:41:48,079
See, I was able to take a moment,

533
00:41:48,671 --> 00:41:49,755
think.

534
00:41:51,392 --> 00:41:53,237
And I realized

535
00:41:54,716 --> 00:41:57,757
that if we did have
a relationship with the Irish...

536
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,966
Which of course, we don't...

537
00:42:02,569 --> 00:42:04,604
What'd stop me
from tipping them off?

538
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:09,085
Letting 'em know
you got 'em under thumb?

539
00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:14,418
You took a huge risk
playing that card,

540
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,120
which means you're desperate.

541
00:42:21,293 --> 00:42:22,330
You got nothing.

542
00:42:29,045 --> 00:42:31,161
You really are the smart one.

543
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:43,025
By the way...

544
00:42:46,515 --> 00:42:47,753
Your bail was posted.

545
00:42:53,694 --> 00:42:55,388
You're all free to go.

546
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:06,624
You ever heard from Kohn?

547
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:13,654
Dangerous being a Fed.

548
00:44:37,802 --> 00:44:42,387
