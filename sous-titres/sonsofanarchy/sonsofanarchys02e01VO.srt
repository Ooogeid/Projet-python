1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,689
<i>Last season on</i> Sons of Anarchy...

2
00:00:02,814 --> 00:00:04,420
Found a box in the storage unit.

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:06,352
It's, like, pictures and journals

4
00:00:06,477 --> 00:00:09,050
and things I never knew about him.
When you and dad hooked up,

5
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:12,614
did he talk to you about his vision?
About what he wanted from the club?

6
00:00:12,739 --> 00:00:15,811
This was in one of his boxes.
He wrote it all down.

7
00:00:15,936 --> 00:00:18,309
John is speaking to him
from the goddamn grave.

8
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:20,897
Robert Munson, you're under arrest
for the murder of Brenda Hefner.

9
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:24,273
- ATF says they've got an eyewitness.
- We checked Opie's finances.

10
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:27,414
Somebody paid off a huge chunk
of his debt. Federal wire transfer.

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,279
I figured, the least I could do

12
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,782
was pay off some
of those big bills of yours.

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,743
I know how this looks.
She set me up to look like a rat.

14
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:38,663
It's all a lie.
Am I good with you, clay?

15
00:00:38,832 --> 00:00:41,165
Opie has turned on us.

16
00:00:41,354 --> 00:00:43,304
This has got to happen, Clay.

17
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:46,837
His death never lands at our feet.

18
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,089
Love you.

19
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:49,847
- Love you back.
- What, a drive-by?

20
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:51,717
Make it ghetto. Make it gangsta.

21
00:00:54,393 --> 00:00:55,244
Shit.

22
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,181
Donna!

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,239
God. Oh, baby.

24
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:03,562
I knew Stahl was setting Opie up
as a rat.

25
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,439
I think Clay tried
to have him killed.

26
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:09,011
Someone last night, in a gangsta SUV
gunned down my daughter.

27
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:11,779
It wasn't us.
Niners didn't kill your daughter.

28
00:01:12,415 --> 00:01:14,156
Jax knows something about Donna.

29
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,617
- He knows everything.
- Did you try to kill Opie?

30
00:01:16,905 --> 00:01:17,949
I love Opie.

31
00:01:18,074 --> 00:01:20,246
Love Donna.
I'd never do nothing to her.

32
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:25,525
<i>To my oldest, wisest friend.
What we started was a good thing.</i>

33
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,503
<i>This book is for all the things
we wanted</i>

34
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,505
<i>and all the things we still can be.</i>

35
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:41,600
Time for a change.

36
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,314
Yeah.

37
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,966
Would you two quit horsing around?

38
00:03:07,046 --> 00:03:09,118
Are you picking us up from school,
gramps?

39
00:03:09,243 --> 00:03:11,093
- We'll see.
- I love you.

40
00:03:11,218 --> 00:03:12,718
See you, sweetheart.

41
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:15,277
You take care of your sister, kid.
You hear me?

42
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,595
Okay, gramps.

43
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:56,961
Sack, new targets.
Put them up.

44
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:58,838
Put them up.

45
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,784
What do you think, gentlemen?

46
00:04:06,307 --> 00:04:07,557
All right, let's talk.

47
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:20,189
That was my...

48
00:04:22,358 --> 00:04:23,758
Yeah, way to go...

49
00:04:23,883 --> 00:04:26,348
You're going to blow off
my one last nut. Great sponsor.

50
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,769
The Russian pipeline's dried up.

51
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,980
We've hooked up with
a source out of Jebalia.

52
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:34,748
Run them through Dungloe.

53
00:04:34,873 --> 00:04:37,743
- How do these break down to ship?
- They don't.

54
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:40,154
- Come assembled.
- That's not our business.

55
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:41,280
I know.

56
00:04:43,623 --> 00:04:45,344
Where you going with this, Cam?

57
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:47,018
True IRA is picking up momentum.

58
00:04:47,318 --> 00:04:49,789
North country's getting hot
and we need to step up our cash flow,

59
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,958
- keep the anger focused.
- You want the Sons to run them?

60
00:04:53,624 --> 00:04:56,295
- Northern Cali, Oregon, Washington.
- I don't know if you heard,

61
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,613
but we got out of the errand business
sometime back.

62
00:05:00,028 --> 00:05:02,287
We buy wholesale,
we assemble, we sell retail.

63
00:05:02,412 --> 00:05:03,562
End of story.

64
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,136
Come on, Clay.

65
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:07,999
We both know you still got
an ATF target on your back.

66
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:11,268
You really think it's safe filling
this new space with illegal gun parts?

67
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,141
What's your deal?

68
00:05:13,685 --> 00:05:15,235
We sell, ship, store.

69
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:17,977
You load your saddlebags, deliver.

70
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:20,486
Charter to charter. Give you 20%.

71
00:05:21,346 --> 00:05:23,238
We get 60%, we assemble our own.

72
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,707
You carry all the risk and overhead.

73
00:05:26,247 --> 00:05:28,035
My son will be your point guy
in Cali.

74
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:30,011
This is a win-win, Clay.

75
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,880
We'll let you talk it through.

76
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,500
Come on, Eddie.

77
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:40,798
It's bullshit.

78
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:43,342
They've still got access
to the Russian surplus.

79
00:05:43,615 --> 00:05:45,928
They're just trying to stonewall us
till we play along.

80
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:47,626
They're mick pricks.

81
00:05:49,435 --> 00:05:51,235
He's right about the feds.

82
00:05:51,846 --> 00:05:53,636
Doesn't matter
what dummy corp we use

83
00:05:53,761 --> 00:05:55,653
or how far off the grid we are.

84
00:05:55,778 --> 00:05:58,078
If ATF puts a tail on any one of us,

85
00:05:58,503 --> 00:06:01,103
we're going to lead them
right back here.

86
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:03,153
What do you think, VP?

87
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:07,324
Go get the Irish.

88
00:06:11,727 --> 00:06:15,040
You get us the Russian guns we need
to keep our Oakland business intact.

89
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,334
We use your facility
to store and assemble.

90
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:20,153
Then we'll run
your hardware up the coast.

91
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:22,332
But...

92
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:25,744
MC Pony Express
is going to cost you 30%.

93
00:06:27,376 --> 00:06:28,376
25.

94
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:30,312
28.

95
00:06:31,252 --> 00:06:32,474
And the Russian stock.

96
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:40,399
It's a temporary fix, boys.

97
00:06:41,342 --> 00:06:43,527
Keeps us in the gun business
till the heat wears off,

98
00:06:43,877 --> 00:06:46,127
and we're running out of road here.

99
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,839
Call a vote, pres.

100
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:53,213
All in favor?

101
00:06:57,003 --> 00:06:58,003
Deal.

102
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:07,604
Release papers.

103
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:11,013
Your lawyer
has already been through them.

104
00:07:11,313 --> 00:07:13,089
Read them, initial the boxes,

105
00:07:13,214 --> 00:07:15,638
sign them, and we'll have you home
by the end of the day.

106
00:07:15,763 --> 00:07:18,452
Rosen told me my case
was thrown out three weeks ago.

107
00:07:18,577 --> 00:07:20,898
You mind telling me
why I'm just getting cut loose now?

108
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,897
The witness went missing.

109
00:07:25,285 --> 00:07:29,289
State attorney dismissed the case,
but we can detain for up to 30 days,

110
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,126
in the hopes
that the case gets reinstated.

111
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,251
It didn't.

112
00:07:33,747 --> 00:07:34,997
That's it, huh?

113
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:39,751
Your pretty face gets smashed in,
you spend months,

114
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,876
how many thousands
of dollars trying to crush us?

115
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:45,101
What for, bitch?

116
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:46,989
What do you get?

117
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:49,792
Peace of mind.

118
00:07:53,938 --> 00:07:56,422
Now that we're keeping
the Oakland business,

119
00:07:56,547 --> 00:07:58,797
who the hell we gonna sell guns to?

120
00:07:59,014 --> 00:08:00,014
Niners?

121
00:08:00,308 --> 00:08:01,308
Mayans?

122
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,606
Who?

123
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,767
Opie back yet?

124
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,903
- Today.
- All right,

125
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:10,601
let's sit down, figure out the move.

126
00:08:13,136 --> 00:08:14,536
We should do that.

127
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:20,534
Cap.

128
00:08:21,014 --> 00:08:23,510
Opie's going to want payback
for Donna's death, right?

129
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:26,002
Jax and Piney both know
it wasn't the Niners.

130
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:28,549
Any ideas where the hell
we're going to land with this?

131
00:08:31,948 --> 00:08:33,448
Give Trammel a call.

132
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:35,889
We're gonna need some police intel.

133
00:08:36,117 --> 00:08:37,317
I can do that.

134
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:41,238
Must be very frustrating, Mr. Hale.

135
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:43,841
Every surrounding town
from Stockton to Lodi

136
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:46,358
has grown nearly 70%
in the last two decades.

137
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:49,361
- Except Charming.
- Samcro has sabotaged

138
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,505
every major development effort
that's come through Charming.

139
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,880
Coercion and violence.

140
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:56,469
Easy to do with the local cops
in your pocket.

141
00:08:56,594 --> 00:09:00,394
Kid brother will be chief in two months.
Things are gonna change.

142
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:02,688
My family built this town.

143
00:09:02,868 --> 00:09:05,252
My great great grandfather,
his brothers.

144
00:09:05,621 --> 00:09:06,959
Before my old man dies,

145
00:09:07,084 --> 00:09:09,573
the Hales are going to give it
back to the folks who live here.

146
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:12,948
And that salvation nets you
a tidy real estate profit.

147
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:14,989
Progress has rewards.

148
00:09:16,268 --> 00:09:18,897
I'm sure we can find
a way to help each other.

149
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:20,567
David, glad you could join us.

150
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:23,061
I'd like you to meet Ethan Zobelle,

151
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,355
AJ Weston.

152
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,897
Can I get you anything, David?

153
00:09:30,022 --> 00:09:32,572
- Just some coffee, Hanna.
- You got it.

154
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:35,677
So, what's this about, Jake?

155
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,492
I reached out to your family,

156
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,461
asked for an introduction.

157
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:41,124
Ethan owns cigar shops.

158
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:43,149
Stockton, Alameda, Millbrae.

159
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,023
Planning on opening
a shop here in Charming?

160
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:48,098
I had my eye on a storefront.

161
00:09:48,983 --> 00:09:52,341
We'll need to know we've got the right
support before we commit to Charming.

162
00:09:52,752 --> 00:09:53,752
Support?

163
00:09:54,364 --> 00:09:55,737
To protect our investment.

164
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:57,881
We're aware of your outlaw problem.

165
00:09:58,006 --> 00:10:01,306
Your brother's brought me up
to speed on your struggle.

166
00:10:04,957 --> 00:10:07,357
I'm guessing
this isn't about cigars.

167
00:10:09,131 --> 00:10:11,181
Ethan shares a common interest.

168
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,496
The Sons of Anarchy have been supplying
weapons to gang members

169
00:10:15,621 --> 00:10:17,635
for over a decade.

170
00:10:18,457 --> 00:10:20,007
It's time it stopped.

171
00:10:22,378 --> 00:10:24,266
League of American Nationalists.

172
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:27,791
The league represents
an influential group of businessmen

173
00:10:28,053 --> 00:10:32,005
who are tired of criminals
underming local enterprise.

174
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,390
Right.
And how many black and latino

175
00:10:34,515 --> 00:10:36,301
businessmen in your
influential group?

176
00:10:40,443 --> 00:10:41,443
None.

177
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:44,391
I know who you are.

178
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:46,311
White hate.

179
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:48,313
Quite the opposite,

180
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:49,991
deputy chief.

181
00:10:51,687 --> 00:10:53,334
We are separatists,

182
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:54,903
not supremacists.

183
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:57,701
We are god-fearing patriots,

184
00:10:58,004 --> 00:10:59,154
and in a time

185
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,413
when black radicals
are in power in this country,

186
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:05,515
we are desperately trying
to remind our citizens

187
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,440
of their founding beliefs.

188
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,235
That all white men
are created equal.

189
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,754
- The hell do you want from me?
- Call us what you want.

190
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,273
We have the same goal.

191
00:11:14,398 --> 00:11:16,506
Stop scumbags from arming scumbags.

192
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:18,810
We just want you to know

193
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:22,097
we are at your disposal
if you need us.

194
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,532
Come on. David.

195
00:11:26,255 --> 00:11:27,805
I'm sorry. His, uh...

196
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:30,443
self-righteousness
gets the best of him.

197
00:11:30,568 --> 00:11:32,218
I admire his frankness.

198
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:39,657
Davey!

199
00:11:41,424 --> 00:11:43,118
Do you know what those guys do?

200
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:45,257
Since when do you smoke up
with neo-nazis?

201
00:11:45,382 --> 00:11:47,539
I know who they are.
I'm not an idiot.

202
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:50,068
Charming is our town, Davey.

203
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:52,115
Dad tried for years
to get it back from Samcro.

204
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,976
He couldn't, but you and me, we can.

205
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:56,062
I'm not going to swap one outlaw
for another one.

206
00:11:56,187 --> 00:11:59,820
The league's got no interest in
Charming. For them, it's all about race.

207
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:01,383
And that makes it okay?

208
00:12:01,508 --> 00:12:02,804
Grow up, little brother!

209
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,786
<i>Riding through this world</i>

210
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,705
<i>All alone</i>

211
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,766
<i>God takes your soul</i>

212
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,610
<i>You're on your own</i>

213
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:37,798
<i>The crow flies straight</i>

214
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:40,148
<i>A perfect line</i>

215
00:12:41,943 --> 00:12:43,512
<i>On the devil's bed</i>

216
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,350
<i>Until you die</i>

217
00:12:49,111 --> 00:12:50,936
<i>Gotta look this life</i>

218
00:12:52,463 --> 00:12:53,480
<i>In the eye</i>

219
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:57,126
Sons of Anarchy - 201 - Albification

220
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,217
It's good to see you, brother.

221
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,139
How was the walkabout?

222
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:30,757
I'm doing okay.

223
00:13:33,008 --> 00:13:33,937
What's this?

224
00:13:34,673 --> 00:13:35,673
Holy shit.

225
00:13:36,654 --> 00:13:37,704
Panhead EG.

226
00:13:38,946 --> 00:13:40,368
- '63?
- '65.

227
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,821
Where'd you find it?

228
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,247
CHP pulled me over outside of Ukiah.

229
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:48,112
Started bullshitting with me. They
turned me on to this used parts guy.

230
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:49,986
Electra glide was just

231
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:53,479
rotting behind some garage.
It's all there. Stock.

232
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:55,669
That'll keep you busy.

233
00:13:56,445 --> 00:13:57,627
That's the plan.

234
00:13:58,948 --> 00:14:00,255
I missed you, bro.

235
00:14:01,635 --> 00:14:02,924
How's everybody doing?

236
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,046
You know, gettin' it done.

237
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,056
We made a new deal with the Irish.

238
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:13,821
Gonna run handguns up the coast
till the ATF heat dies down.

239
00:14:13,946 --> 00:14:15,437
What does that do to business?

240
00:14:15,946 --> 00:14:17,746
We keep supplying Oakland.

241
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:21,193
We need to figure out
who that supply goes to.

242
00:14:23,055 --> 00:14:24,155
Retaliation.

243
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,949
We're sitting down to figure it out.

244
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,060
Waited until you got back.

245
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:36,078
He's too skinny, right?

246
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:38,461
We'll beef him up.

247
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:40,749
Kids will be so glad to see you.

248
00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:43,771
I got some things to take care of. You
mind picking them up from school, ma?

249
00:14:43,896 --> 00:14:45,246
We can wait, man.

250
00:14:46,388 --> 00:14:48,136
I'll see the kids later, ma.

251
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:50,794
See you at the clubhouse.

252
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,740
Ope loves his kids.

253
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:02,025
We all just got
to give him a minute.

254
00:15:03,126 --> 00:15:04,694
Take care of him, Jax.

255
00:15:15,722 --> 00:15:16,872
He's perfect.

256
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,406
- The echoes?
- Clean. CBC, CMP's were all normal.

257
00:15:20,531 --> 00:15:22,980
His weight needs to come up
a little bit, but other than that...

258
00:15:23,105 --> 00:15:25,194
But he's still real fussy
with the feedings.

259
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:27,842
Could be the lactose.
We can try soy base.

260
00:15:28,297 --> 00:15:30,637
I don't want to turn him
into a little vegan pussy.

261
00:15:31,623 --> 00:15:34,273
He can drink it in
his wife-beater onesie.

262
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:35,932
Dr. Funny.

263
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:38,895
How's his sleep apnea?

264
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:44,901
- You're there pretty much every night.
- Times I'm there, he's sleeping fine.

265
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,050
Good.

266
00:15:57,977 --> 00:15:59,327
Heard Ope's back.

267
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:02,276
You seen him?

268
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:03,799
He's doing okay.

269
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:05,589
That's why I'm here.

270
00:16:06,785 --> 00:16:08,425
Look, this guy's
been through enough.

271
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,780
So whoever is responsible
for killing Donna...

272
00:16:15,123 --> 00:16:16,923
You and me can't prove it.

273
00:16:17,374 --> 00:16:19,311
The suspicions
we have don't help Ope.

274
00:16:20,004 --> 00:16:21,852
If he asks me,
I'm not going to lie to him,

275
00:16:21,977 --> 00:16:24,691
- because I can't prove it was Clay.
- Run it through, man.

276
00:16:24,995 --> 00:16:26,745
What does it get anybody?

277
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,850
Turns Opie inside out.

278
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,690
He loses the only family
he's got left.

279
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,211
Puts Clay on the attack.

280
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,746
He shits in unser's ear,
it's gonna blow back on you.

281
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,700
All right, I'll protect Ope.
I'll keep my suspicions to myself,

282
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:48,875
but you've got
to do something for me.

283
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:50,717
Unser is in bad shape.

284
00:16:51,191 --> 00:16:53,391
This guy should not be on the job.

285
00:16:54,017 --> 00:16:57,417
He's got another two months
on his extension. After that,

286
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,559
you got to let him step down.

287
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,482
I'll do what I can
to make that happen.

288
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Wade?

289
00:17:15,376 --> 00:17:16,376
Gemma.

290
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:21,292
The little guy doing okay?

291
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:24,916
Got to beef him up a little.

292
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:28,515
How about you?

293
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,075
Right as rain.

294
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,630
This is just a...

295
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:35,589
follow-up.

296
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,125
Where are you at with it?

297
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,250
The BCG's are keeping it contained
to my bladder.

298
00:17:44,002 --> 00:17:45,402
Guess that's good.

299
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:50,860
You waiting on Della?

300
00:17:51,816 --> 00:17:53,766
She ain't a fan of hospitals.

301
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,300
Hale's picking me up.

302
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:01,721
We'll wait with ya.

303
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,868
I'm glad he's doing good.

304
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,048
I think Jax is going
to make a real good daddy.

305
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:14,584
I'll make sure of that.

306
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:16,859
No doubt.

307
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,775
It's for my heart condition.

308
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,194
Miracle drug.

309
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:47,379
Hey, jefe.

310
00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:53,801
Talked over your offer with my guys.

311
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,955
Talked over?
It's a no-brainer.

312
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,220
I'm a little fuzzy about
your end in this.

313
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,535
What exactly goes
into the league's pocket?

314
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,266
You think this is
about money for us?

315
00:19:05,614 --> 00:19:07,347
You got kids, Darby?

316
00:19:09,705 --> 00:19:11,989
I just pulled my six-year-old out
of tee ball

317
00:19:12,114 --> 00:19:14,891
'cause I found out
they're giving trophies to every boy

318
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:17,864
on every team
for simply playing the game.

319
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:20,358
Trophies should be earned.

320
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:24,593
Teaching children that everyone's equal
is a dangerous philosophy.

321
00:19:28,857 --> 00:19:30,752
But maybe you've lost sight of that.

322
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,350
Business is down 30%.
I can't afford the white guys.

323
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,616
Never put money before race.

324
00:19:40,518 --> 00:19:41,785
This is $5,000.

325
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,760
It should get you operational
inside charming.

326
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,219
When clay finds out that I'm dealing
crank and pussy in his backyard...

327
00:19:52,344 --> 00:19:54,234
There's a phone number
inside the envelope.

328
00:19:54,586 --> 00:19:58,286
Call it and tell our aryan brothers
how much manpower you need.

329
00:19:58,942 --> 00:20:01,616
And if I were you,
I'd button your shirt.

330
00:20:02,845 --> 00:20:04,494
I got nothing to hide.

331
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,405
It's not about hiding...

332
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:08,748
you haven't earned it.

333
00:20:51,771 --> 00:20:53,057
I talked to Hale.

334
00:20:53,182 --> 00:20:54,586
He understands.

335
00:20:55,278 --> 00:20:56,278
Right.

336
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:03,958
Keeping this between us
is the best thing for now.

337
00:21:06,114 --> 00:21:07,891
You hear what I'm saying, Piney?

338
00:21:08,215 --> 00:21:10,018
Clay tried to kill my son.

339
00:21:10,432 --> 00:21:12,353
He slaughtered his wife by mistake.

340
00:21:13,124 --> 00:21:15,440
I'm depending on you
to make that right, kid.

341
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,495
Look, you got to trust me, Piney.

342
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,524
Me fixing things
doesn't happen quick or easy.

343
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,073
Right now it's about protecting Ope.

344
00:21:26,717 --> 00:21:27,738
We'll see.

345
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,374
I haven't been able to say this
yet on a club level.

346
00:21:33,948 --> 00:21:36,210
We're all broken up about
what happened to Donna.

347
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:38,718
She was a great girl.

348
00:21:39,663 --> 00:21:41,090
I know how much you loved her.

349
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:43,513
She sure loved you.

350
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,060
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,722
Thanks.

352
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,934
Now we got to deal
with the underbelly of this.

353
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:53,269
Those bullets that killed her...

354
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,146
They were meant for you.

355
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:57,309
We gotta settle that.

356
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,484
Had to be the niners.

357
00:22:00,267 --> 00:22:04,044
Unser said it was a gangsta suv.
Black guy driving.

358
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:06,719
No one saw who was driving,
Ope, no one.

359
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:08,785
We're pretty sure
the guy was not black.

360
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,989
- He was brown.
- Mayans?

361
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:15,821
- How do you know?
- Jax and Piney talked with Laroy.

362
00:22:16,165 --> 00:22:18,628
So we know it wasn't the niners.

363
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,289
That's right.

364
00:22:23,872 --> 00:22:25,885
As far as Laroy is concerned,

365
00:22:26,254 --> 00:22:28,119
the niners and the soa are good.

366
00:22:28,244 --> 00:22:29,794
And you believed him?

367
00:22:31,343 --> 00:22:32,343
We did.

368
00:22:33,637 --> 00:22:35,737
I know the truth when I hear it.

369
00:22:36,302 --> 00:22:37,772
It's got to be Alvarez.

370
00:22:38,314 --> 00:22:39,551
He thinks we set him up.

371
00:22:39,676 --> 00:22:42,777
We took his money, then we left him
behind to get shredded by the niners.

372
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,654
I had Trammel look into it.

373
00:22:45,051 --> 00:22:46,984
Black Range Rover got jacked

374
00:22:47,676 --> 00:22:50,284
outside a bar in Alameda
that same night.

375
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,802
It turns up two days later,

376
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,732
a few miles down the road
from the mayan clubhouse in heyward.

377
00:22:55,857 --> 00:22:57,964
Mac-10 casings on the floor...

378
00:22:58,287 --> 00:22:59,706
Same kind of gun killed Donna.

379
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:02,302
There was prints on the dash.
Before the end of the day,

380
00:23:02,427 --> 00:23:04,339
we're gonna know who was driving.

381
00:23:04,464 --> 00:23:05,883
I convinced Trammel

382
00:23:06,795 --> 00:23:08,720
to let us handle the arrest.

383
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,680
I'm the one who kills him.

384
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:12,781
Agreed.

385
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:15,101
You, Tig and Chibs.

386
00:23:15,383 --> 00:23:16,436
And me.

387
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:17,726
I want Jax.

388
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:24,569
All right.

389
00:23:51,784 --> 00:23:53,765
Looks like Trammel earned his pay.

390
00:23:54,939 --> 00:23:56,684
You got something you need to say?

391
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:58,895
We both know this is bullshit.

392
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:03,008
The only reason I don't set fire
to it is 'cause I love Ope.

393
00:24:03,565 --> 00:24:04,718
And the truth

394
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,075
- would kill him.
- We all love Ope.

395
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,570
He needs this.

396
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:11,367
And we're gonna give it to him.

397
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,118
Whoever you put this murder on,

398
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,537
just make sure they deserve to die.

399
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,805
'cause the guy that killed Donna

400
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:21,918
is out there sharing a beer
with her husband.

401
00:24:22,301 --> 00:24:24,921
You'd better be real careful
how you navigate around this one.

402
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,089
Or what,

403
00:24:26,594 --> 00:24:29,300
you gonna put a bullet
in the back of my head, too?

404
00:24:49,545 --> 00:24:50,595
That's him.

405
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,782
Restocking his dealers.

406
00:24:53,385 --> 00:24:54,618
Elian Perez.

407
00:24:55,469 --> 00:24:56,953
Out of corcoran three months ago,

408
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,380
manslaughter.

409
00:24:58,505 --> 00:25:00,623
Chinese menu of drug
and assault charges.

410
00:25:01,925 --> 00:25:03,725
How do we want to do this?

411
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:06,405
Too many eyes here.

412
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,839
He's on the move.

413
00:25:31,145 --> 00:25:32,545
This block's dead.

414
00:25:36,061 --> 00:25:37,455
Take the wheel.

415
00:25:47,444 --> 00:25:48,494
Here we go.

416
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:53,301
Pull up on his left.

417
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:08,774
Around the back!

418
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,640
Go!

419
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:41,908
Get out, go!

420
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,727
Get up,

421
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:47,957
- Get in the van!
- I know, man.

422
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,429
Move it, move it!

423
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:01,978
- Planning a trip?
- I'm just seeing what charters

424
00:27:02,103 --> 00:27:04,332
we're gonna need to make
this thing work with the irish.

425
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:07,351
If it involves you and a map,
we're screwed.

426
00:27:07,476 --> 00:27:09,119
Saying I got no sense of direction?

427
00:27:09,244 --> 00:27:12,838
I'm saying you need a GPS to get
from the driveway to the front door.

428
00:27:14,712 --> 00:27:17,212
You know,
I'd be lost without you, baby.

429
00:27:17,337 --> 00:27:18,552
Got that right.

430
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,876
How'd it go with opie?

431
00:27:29,001 --> 00:27:30,001
All good.

432
00:27:30,568 --> 00:27:34,110
We determined it was a mayan problem.
We're taking care of it.

433
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,904
- Jax?
He's on board,

434
00:27:37,195 --> 00:27:38,447
just like I told you.

435
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,807
Is that what you told me?

436
00:27:48,885 --> 00:27:51,236
I hired Neeta to help with him.

437
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,197
There goes
my underage nanny fantasy.

438
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,288
Actually...

439
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,628
It's time for your 2:00 feeding.

440
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:25,578
Tell me you did it.

441
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:26,787
What?

442
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,731
Tell me you killed my wife.

443
00:28:29,856 --> 00:28:31,606
What the hell are you talking about?

444
00:28:31,731 --> 00:28:34,288
Tell me you pulled up behind her

445
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,757
and unloaded an entire clip
into the back of her head.

446
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:42,136
I didn't kill your wife, man.
You got the wrong guy, holmes!

447
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,569
Go with them.
Go on.

448
00:28:51,525 --> 00:28:53,425
This wasn't the mayans, man.

449
00:28:53,704 --> 00:28:55,566
Not our shit, I swear.

450
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,240
I've got no beef with samcro.

451
00:28:59,642 --> 00:29:03,282
- The hell you doing, man?
- I'm not leaving here with any doubt.

452
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,077
The longer this takes,
the greater the risk.

453
00:29:08,027 --> 00:29:09,080
Just do the guy.

454
00:29:09,488 --> 00:29:11,785
Let's get the hell out of here.

455
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,962
You guys can go.

456
00:29:14,932 --> 00:29:16,712
I gotta do this my way.

457
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,422
- Listen to me...
- If it was tara

458
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,650
who had her head blown off,
you'd be ripping off that guy's fingers

459
00:29:21,775 --> 00:29:23,018
one by one.

460
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,342
I gotta know.

461
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,520
Okay.

462
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,359
What the hell are you doing, man?!

463
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:40,584
Let me go!

464
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:42,969
What's going on, man?

465
00:29:43,218 --> 00:29:45,218
I won't say anything, I won't!

466
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:52,623
Guy broke loose, reached for my gun,
had to blow him up, man.

467
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:53,949
Sorry, O.

468
00:29:57,434 --> 00:29:58,822
No doubt, bro.

469
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,478
This guy killed Donna.

470
00:30:30,742 --> 00:30:32,329
Jesus Christ.

471
00:30:36,925 --> 00:30:39,117
That's so alvarez knows who and why.

472
00:30:39,242 --> 00:30:40,588
Get rid of those guns.

473
00:30:40,928 --> 00:30:43,418
You guys take the van, head back.
I'll dump the body.

474
00:30:43,543 --> 00:30:45,046
You're dropping him on mayan turf.

475
00:30:45,171 --> 00:30:46,908
You can't do it on your own,
Jackie Boy.

476
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:49,346
You guys need to be there
when the feds drop off Bobby.

477
00:30:50,377 --> 00:30:51,427
I got this.

478
00:31:02,968 --> 00:31:03,968
It's done.

479
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,668
- <i>How's the kid?</i>
- That is one tough little man.

480
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,713
<i>Labwork is all good.
Heart and tummy looking strong.</i>

481
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,031
That's great.

482
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:25,612
You okay?

483
00:31:25,737 --> 00:31:27,987
<i>Yeah, I'm just in the middle of it.</i>

484
00:31:28,198 --> 00:31:30,262
- Am I gonna see you later?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

485
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,625
I gotta drop something in Hayward,
and then we got bobby's party.

486
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,434
Gemma said she'd stay with the kid.

487
00:31:35,818 --> 00:31:39,071
- I'll come by, relieve her.
<i>- That'll be good.</i>

488
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:41,202
Love you.

489
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,021
I love you, too.

490
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,947
Balls! Shit! I'm so sorry.

491
00:31:59,954 --> 00:32:03,958
- I was just putting this here.
- Either join in or get out, sparky!

492
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,885
- You didn't mean that you want me...
- Get out!

493
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:14,849
Shit!

494
00:32:18,098 --> 00:32:19,098
Kids, huh?

495
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:21,088
I'm sorry, my love.

496
00:32:29,811 --> 00:32:32,709
I meant what I said, you know.

497
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:37,955
I would be lost without you.

498
00:32:40,762 --> 00:32:42,312
I'm right here, baby.

499
00:32:46,542 --> 00:32:47,992
That's my good boy.

500
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:19,867
We good?

501
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,417
Things got a little complicated.

502
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:24,918
I want to know?

503
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,136
No worries.

504
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:27,829
Jax cleaned it up.

505
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:32,509
Think this moves him past it?

506
00:33:33,043 --> 00:33:34,470
Opie?
I don't know, man.

507
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,127
He's working some shit out.

508
00:33:41,123 --> 00:33:43,020
You should go home.

509
00:33:43,372 --> 00:33:44,572
See your kids.

510
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:51,779
I don't give a shit
how bad you feel.

511
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:55,574
You need to pull your sad little head
out of your ass and go be a father.

512
00:33:56,055 --> 00:33:58,911
I'm tired of carrying
your damn water, boy.

513
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:06,045
It ain't your fault,
and it sure as hell ain't theirs.

514
00:34:06,851 --> 00:34:08,653
Love you, too, pop.

515
00:34:14,994 --> 00:34:16,594
What the hell is this?

516
00:34:21,198 --> 00:34:22,685
Garage is closed.

517
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:25,312
We're not here for, uh, car repairs.

518
00:34:25,632 --> 00:34:29,047
I understand you're a camacho fan.

519
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,903
Who are you?

520
00:34:33,883 --> 00:34:37,133
Just dropping by to give you
a little friendly advice.

521
00:34:39,141 --> 00:34:40,813
And what advice would that be?

522
00:34:40,938 --> 00:34:43,053
We feel it would be best
for all concerned

523
00:34:43,178 --> 00:34:46,750
if you stop dealing arms
to the one niners and the mayans.

524
00:34:50,952 --> 00:34:52,798
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

525
00:34:53,293 --> 00:34:56,161
We're just mechanics
and Harley lovers.

526
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,824
- That's one of Darby's guys back there.
- Mr. Darby is one of our supporters.

527
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:05,692
Expensive car.

528
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:10,273
Hell of a suit.

529
00:35:10,871 --> 00:35:12,192
All your teeth.

530
00:35:14,441 --> 00:35:16,991
Must be the top
of the aryan food chain?

531
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:20,325
What you do for a living
is between you and your Maker.

532
00:35:20,735 --> 00:35:23,620
I'm not here to adjust
your moral compass.

533
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,635
This is just a reality check.

534
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,110
You're a criminal
and you're done selling guns to color.

535
00:35:29,245 --> 00:35:31,931
Are you gonna shoot me, mr.
Trager?

536
00:35:32,651 --> 00:35:34,590
With all these witnesses?

537
00:35:38,564 --> 00:35:39,564
Look,

538
00:35:39,957 --> 00:35:42,377
I don't know
what Darby told you and,

539
00:35:43,011 --> 00:35:45,633
I don't know what your angle is, but

540
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,984
let me be real clear.

541
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,315
Nobody threatens samcro.

542
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:55,267
And nobody tells us
what we can and can't do.

543
00:35:55,857 --> 00:35:56,857
Black,

544
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,140
brown

545
00:35:59,392 --> 00:36:00,407
or white.

546
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,258
So, why don't you just

547
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:06,538
climb back into your little german
clown car and drive back to nazi town?

548
00:36:07,468 --> 00:36:10,427
'cause the next time
you piss all over my shoes,

549
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,461
he will kill you.

550
00:36:13,477 --> 00:36:16,477
I don't give a shit
how many witnesses there are.

551
00:36:17,981 --> 00:36:20,915
My shop opens in a few weeks.

552
00:36:21,908 --> 00:36:23,055
Until then...

553
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:28,290
Enjoy.

554
00:36:36,212 --> 00:36:37,431
Sorry, ma'am.

555
00:36:45,674 --> 00:36:48,324
- I want to know everything.
- You got it.

556
00:36:49,936 --> 00:36:51,355
Good work.

557
00:36:54,654 --> 00:36:56,154
Who the hell's that?

558
00:36:57,522 --> 00:36:59,468
Friend of Darby's.

559
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,618
Nothing to worry about.

560
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,971
Thanks for giving him a lift.
What do I owe you?

561
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,140
No charge.

562
00:37:47,984 --> 00:37:49,119
Enjoy the party.

563
00:37:49,244 --> 00:37:50,934
You want to stick
around for a while?

564
00:37:51,308 --> 00:37:53,770
I figure you can do some major
damage to a stripper pole.

565
00:37:54,396 --> 00:37:55,746
You have no idea.

566
00:38:02,674 --> 00:38:03,824
Welcome back.

567
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,575
It's me.

568
00:38:16,656 --> 00:38:18,086
I told Jax I'd come by.

569
00:38:18,703 --> 00:38:21,470
- You didn't need to do that.
- I wanted to.

570
00:38:29,687 --> 00:38:30,865
There we go.

571
00:38:35,515 --> 00:38:36,897
You on the pill?

572
00:38:38,845 --> 00:38:40,442
Just wondering.

573
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:42,300
You got that look.

574
00:38:43,149 --> 00:38:45,822
The aching, empty-womb look?

575
00:38:46,696 --> 00:38:48,408
Something like that.

576
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:59,357
You think I'm using Jax
to get knocked up?

577
00:38:59,482 --> 00:39:01,046
No. Jesus, I hope not.

578
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:04,341
You gonna trap someone,
make sure they've got money.

579
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,599
Where are you on this, Gemma?

580
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:08,553
Me and jax.

581
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:11,473
- What do you care what I think?
- Jax cares.

582
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,085
You really want my advice?

583
00:39:21,065 --> 00:39:22,585
Total disclosure.

584
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:24,878
What do you mean?

585
00:39:25,053 --> 00:39:26,989
It's the only way it works
with you and him.

586
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:28,715
You're too smart.

587
00:39:29,272 --> 00:39:30,272
Too...

588
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:32,705
Too neurotic to live in the vague.

589
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,371
He needs to tell you everything.

590
00:39:34,961 --> 00:39:37,414
No truth, no pussy.
You draw the line.

591
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,780
I'm not sure I want to know.

592
00:39:45,452 --> 00:39:47,252
Then this will never last.

593
00:39:51,217 --> 00:39:54,055
Did John Teller tell you everything?

594
00:40:01,346 --> 00:40:03,357
You love the man...

595
00:40:04,164 --> 00:40:06,603
You learn to love the club.

596
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,409
You can do that,

597
00:40:09,438 --> 00:40:11,639
there's no truth you can't handle.

598
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,320
Glad you're back, bro!

599
00:40:43,445 --> 00:40:45,555
Me, too. Shit.

600
00:40:48,203 --> 00:40:50,205
Got a lot to catch up on.

601
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,035
I'll let you get back
to your dinner.

602
00:41:29,328 --> 00:41:30,478
Help, please!

603
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:35,742
My baby swallowed something!
He's choking! Please help me!

604
00:41:36,534 --> 00:41:37,534
All right.

605
00:41:40,116 --> 00:41:41,562
What did he swallow?

606
00:41:41,687 --> 00:41:43,993
A bottle cap or something.

607
00:41:59,165 --> 00:42:01,015
What happened to the party?

608
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,519
Saw Bobby.

609
00:42:03,447 --> 00:42:05,297
I didn't feel like staying.

610
00:42:09,058 --> 00:42:10,235
What's the matter?

611
00:42:11,289 --> 00:42:12,879
I'm just tired.

612
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,981
I'm gonna take a shower.

613
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:16,384
You know why I run away
from shit all the time?

614
00:43:17,398 --> 00:43:20,305
'cause I don't trust anyone.

615
00:43:22,672 --> 00:43:25,443
If I'm gonna stay,
I need to know the truth.

616
00:43:26,631 --> 00:43:28,334
I tell you the truth.

617
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:32,500
Not just what you think
I can handle.

618
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:34,298
I need all of it.

619
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,787
It's the only way I'll know
if I can do this.

620
00:43:50,167 --> 00:43:52,217
I helped Opie kill a man today.

621
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:57,130
Retaliation for Donna.

622
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:01,640
Shot him in the head.

623
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,525
I'm going to bed.

624
00:45:17,577 --> 00:45:19,358
What do you want?!

625
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,655
You know who I am?!

626
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,304
You know what I can do to you?!

627
00:45:25,497 --> 00:45:29,351
Take off the mask,
you goddamn piece of shit!

628
00:46:19,697 --> 00:46:21,538
Bobby's passed out...

629
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,246
Face down in red bush mountain.

630
00:46:27,508 --> 00:46:29,108
Good to have him back.

631
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,635
We're gonna come
out the other side of this.

632
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,295
Yeah, we are.

633
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,640
Shit always works out.

634
00:46:59,245 --> 00:47:00,613
I'm sorry, ma'am.

635
00:47:00,738 --> 00:47:02,209
We're almost done.

636
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:05,530
Please.

637
00:47:06,352 --> 00:47:09,494
We need you to pass on
a message to your old man.

638
00:47:10,132 --> 00:47:13,274
Tell him to stop selling guns
to niggers and wetbacks

639
00:47:13,399 --> 00:47:16,436
or we find you and we do this again.

640
