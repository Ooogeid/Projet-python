1
00:00:07,739 --> 00:00:10,182
You okay selling
these guys five AKs?

2
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:13,341
Natey just hangs out
with these survivalist cats,

3
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:15,611
bunch of crazy old guys playing...

4
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:18,437
I don't know,
capture the flag or something.

5
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:20,568
I wanted to thank you

6
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:23,272
for peeling a few free so I could...

7
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:25,654
- let this happen, huh?
- No problem, Piney.

8
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:32,966
Those Russians make a hell of a gun,
I'll give them that.

9
00:00:38,883 --> 00:00:40,793
Looks like you're about 5,000 light.

10
00:00:42,122 --> 00:00:44,091
I thought we were getting
a family discount.

11
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,905
You are. $10,000.

12
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,761
I know damn well these guns
go for a grand on the street.

13
00:00:50,272 --> 00:00:52,554
When was the last time
you were on the street, junior?

14
00:00:52,898 --> 00:00:54,589
Russ, we had a deal.

15
00:00:55,218 --> 00:00:57,348
Give the man his goddamn money.

16
00:00:58,769 --> 00:00:59,687
Pay him.

17
00:01:01,246 --> 00:01:02,362
Here. Sorry.

18
00:01:04,255 --> 00:01:05,429
Thanks, Piney.

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,106
- I'll be seeing you.
- Yeah, Nate.

20
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,605
You take it easy, brother.

21
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:22,107
You're too...

22
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,261
You got to get me
a little wet, baby.

23
00:01:33,423 --> 00:01:34,435
Shit.

24
00:01:38,382 --> 00:01:40,530
Wait a minute. Where you going?

25
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,511
How is this my fault?

26
00:01:57,922 --> 00:01:59,307
Jesus.
Half-Sack.

27
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:00,810
What?

28
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,043
Get in here.

29
00:02:03,816 --> 00:02:05,396
Jesus Christ.

30
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:12,463
- What the hell is this?
- Oh, man.

31
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:20,594
Who do you think would be flushing
panties down the shitter?

32
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,170
That's weird.

33
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,076
You think?

34
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:28,386
How'd this morning go?

35
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,901
Those jarheads are dicks,
but it made Piney happy.

36
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:34,091
- I think it's cool.
- Any tails?

37
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:36,868
Doubled back three times.

38
00:02:37,028 --> 00:02:38,508
No one followed us.

39
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:43,208
- The rest of the AKs are here.
- Call the Niners.

40
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:47,274
I'm sure Leroy will be thrilled that the
Russian firepower appeared a day early.

41
00:02:47,394 --> 00:02:48,671
I'll be right back.

42
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:55,711
We okay?

43
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,144
Yeah.

44
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,408
Yeah, I'm sorry I...

45
00:03:01,646 --> 00:03:02,646
I just...

46
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:04,937
It was a strange morning.

47
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:09,469
I'm fine.

48
00:03:11,595 --> 00:03:12,595
Okay.

49
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:23,163
Do you have the number
for the septic guy?

50
00:03:23,324 --> 00:03:25,332
Piney filled the tanks already?

51
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:26,361
Yeah,

52
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:28,544
and someone's been flushing
lace panties.

53
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:31,785
I don't even know
what to say to that.

54
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,008
Here you go.

55
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:38,701
Thanks.

56
00:03:40,073 --> 00:03:42,057
You look real nice today, Gemma.

57
00:03:42,827 --> 00:03:43,892
Thank you, Eddie.

58
00:03:55,604 --> 00:03:58,241
- It's good to be...
- What the hell is she doing here?

59
00:03:58,401 --> 00:04:00,397
She told me she was getting out
in Bakersfield.

60
00:04:00,517 --> 00:04:03,416
It's not his fault, okay?
I know I'm not supposed to be here.

61
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:04,892
Let me go talk to someone.

62
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:08,895
You talk to somebody in some
other charter, you got that, sweet butt?

63
00:04:09,175 --> 00:04:11,073
- Get her the hell out of here.
- Let's go...

64
00:04:11,193 --> 00:04:12,479
What are you thinking, man?

65
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,008
What was I supposed to do?
Just throw her out of the cab?

66
00:04:16,128 --> 00:04:17,176
Let's go.

67
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,047
- Let's go.
- Get me out of here.

68
00:04:36,432 --> 00:04:37,613
Who's that girl?

69
00:04:40,835 --> 00:04:42,696
I don't really... I don't know.

70
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:46,031
I saw your heart
skip a beat from here.

71
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,210
Who is she?

72
00:04:49,424 --> 00:04:51,262
Just a Tribe hang-around.

73
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:58,222
Clay hit that tart, didn't he?

74
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:01,318
I don't really know
who Clay's hitting.

75
00:05:02,022 --> 00:05:03,180
Except for you.

76
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:06,038
I'm sure he's hitting you

77
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:08,739
'cause you're his wife and all.

78
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,872
Get out.

79
00:06:16,734 --> 00:06:18,862
I'm looking for Good Shepherd
Junior High School.

80
00:06:18,982 --> 00:06:20,870
My grandson's in a play,
and I can't find it.

81
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,037
It's supposed to be out here
on County 18 somewhere.

82
00:06:23,157 --> 00:06:24,134
You missed it.

83
00:06:24,254 --> 00:06:26,639
- It's about six miles back.
- Over there?

84
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:28,368
- Truman exit...
- Don't you move!

85
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,615
Don't move.

86
00:06:30,002 --> 00:06:31,354
Hey, open the back.

87
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,729
- Get Frank out of the van.
- Stay still.

88
00:06:36,142 --> 00:06:37,317
Pull right there!

89
00:06:41,231 --> 00:06:42,953
Don't move! Don't move!

90
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:48,495
- This way. This way, let's go!
- Move, move!

91
00:06:51,032 --> 00:06:52,093
Let's go!

92
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:03,424
Jesus...

93
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:06,460
Who'd McKeavy see up north?

94
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:08,552
Few gun brokers,

95
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:10,418
some Irish expats,

96
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:12,643
and fat, black hookers.

97
00:07:12,955 --> 00:07:14,214
Where's he now?

98
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:16,939
He's greasing the palms
of the Port Authority contacts.

99
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,741
All right, we got a week,

100
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:21,311
maybe ten days,
then he wants his 200K.

101
00:07:22,174 --> 00:07:23,624
We're working on it.

102
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,648
Clay, he made it very clear.

103
00:07:25,768 --> 00:07:28,675
We got to have the money up front
for the IRA to keep them flush.

104
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:30,987
Otherwise,
he'll sell to the Russians.

105
00:07:31,107 --> 00:07:32,221
And we lose

106
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:34,866
the Irish pipeline to our guns.

107
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:38,591
Laroy's gonna take
the three dozen AKs off our hands.

108
00:07:38,997 --> 00:07:40,245
At a deep discount.

109
00:07:40,365 --> 00:07:43,490
It's either that or spend
a month finding a better buyer.

110
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,093
At least this way,
it puts 50 grand in our pockets now.

111
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,887
Plus the ten I got this morning
and the Chinese money.

112
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:51,557
Gets us more than halfway there.

113
00:07:51,852 --> 00:07:52,852
Clay.

114
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,170
You better get out here.

115
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:05,804
Now you're either feds
or limo drivers.

116
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:10,246
Agent Stahl, ATF.

117
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:12,902
I'm looking for the owner
of Teller-Morrow Automotive.

118
00:08:13,022 --> 00:08:13,983
That's me.

119
00:08:14,103 --> 00:08:15,121
Come on.

120
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:16,986
Let's go, Clay.

121
00:08:17,448 --> 00:08:19,184
You gonna bother
mentioning a charge?

122
00:08:19,304 --> 00:08:20,544
No charges yet.

123
00:08:20,705 --> 00:08:24,049
I just need to discuss your relationship
with a Nate Meineke.

124
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:25,238
Who?

125
00:08:25,577 --> 00:08:27,627
Nate Meineke.
He's one of the men who held up

126
00:08:27,747 --> 00:08:29,743
a prison transport vehicle
this morning.

127
00:08:29,863 --> 00:08:32,081
Killed three people with AK-47s.

128
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,244
We found Mr. Meineke's cell phone
at the scene.

129
00:08:35,364 --> 00:08:38,014
Last call he received
was from your garage.

130
00:08:40,922 --> 00:08:41,922
Preference?

131
00:08:42,145 --> 00:08:43,366
Lady's choice.

132
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,349
Tattoos and chivalry.

133
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:47,472
Delicious combination.

134
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:53,397
Ride into this world

135
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,510
All alone

136
00:08:57,722 --> 00:08:59,347
God takes your soul

137
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,250
You're on your own

138
00:09:03,802 --> 00:09:05,528
The crow flies straight

139
00:09:06,701 --> 00:09:08,458
In a perfect line

140
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,055
On the Devil's bed

141
00:09:12,798 --> 00:09:14,262
Until you die

142
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,895
Gotta look this life

143
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:21,773
In the eye.

144
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:25,610
Episode 106 - AK-51

145
00:09:30,845 --> 00:09:32,550
I was in the garage waiting for you.

146
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,287
I just called Nate
to confirm the meet.

147
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:38,168
I never thought anything like this
would happen.

148
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:40,767
You had no idea
what they were up to, Pop.

149
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:43,037
I don't get off that easy, though.

150
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:46,685
I let friendship interfere
with business.

151
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:48,446
I know better.

152
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:50,703
Gotta reach out to 'em, Piney.

153
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,579
We need to find these guys
before the feds do.

154
00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:56,152
Nate will not rat on me.

155
00:09:56,272 --> 00:09:59,045
No, but his dipshit kid
sure as hell would.

156
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,509
It's just a matter of time
before the feds connect you

157
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:03,085
to Nate and come after you, too.

158
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:04,415
You know, Opie.

159
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:06,190
I don't give a shit. How's that?

160
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,860
You know, well, I do.

161
00:10:08,522 --> 00:10:09,737
Take him to the cabin.

162
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,366
So you're calling
the shots now, huh?

163
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:13,849
Till Clay gets out.

164
00:10:13,969 --> 00:10:16,544
The VP patch means this shit
lands on my back.

165
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:22,498
The backs of children.

166
00:10:25,307 --> 00:10:27,175
He's just pissed at himself.

167
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:31,169
The old dude saved his ass in Khe Sanh,
but the rest of that crew?

168
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:33,201
Killed cops and innocents?

169
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:35,052
We'll find 'em.

170
00:10:37,146 --> 00:10:38,421
You call Trammel?

171
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,863
Trammel called us

172
00:10:39,983 --> 00:10:41,227
looking for Clay.

173
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,260
All right, good.

174
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:47,442
No way we're getting those guns
to Laroy with the feds there.

175
00:10:51,337 --> 00:10:53,452
I see
you haven't called your lawyer.

176
00:10:53,572 --> 00:10:55,422
My lawyer's $1,200 an hour.

177
00:10:56,883 --> 00:10:59,088
When I got a problem
worth that pay scale,

178
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,593
I'll give him a call.

179
00:11:00,713 --> 00:11:01,930
And you don't think that

180
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,536
aiding and abetting a murder
and a triple homicide is a problem?

181
00:11:06,828 --> 00:11:09,188
I don't know nothing
about that crime

182
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:11,382
or the guys that did it.

183
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:13,371
Homegrown terrorists.

184
00:11:14,161 --> 00:11:16,378
***ber-right-wing fanatics.

185
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:18,896
Not the brightest figs
in the Newton,

186
00:11:19,016 --> 00:11:20,780
but dangerous enough
to clock a watch.

187
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,326
This 'cause somebody from my garage
called one of those assholes,

188
00:11:24,446 --> 00:11:27,128
that doesn't make me
an accessory of murder.

189
00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:31,072
But your association
with an organized crime syndicate

190
00:11:31,312 --> 00:11:32,946
and your rap sheet for gunrunning

191
00:11:33,107 --> 00:11:36,246
flags you as a source
of their illegal AKs.

192
00:11:36,848 --> 00:11:39,282
Sons of Anarchy
is a motorcycle club,

193
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,038
and, just for you information,

194
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:45,041
I haven't been charged with a crime,

195
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:46,894
gun-related or otherwise,

196
00:11:47,014 --> 00:11:48,464
in over seven years.

197
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,040
I'm a mechanic

198
00:11:52,076 --> 00:11:54,415
and a motorcycle enthusiast.

199
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,069
You are a criminal

200
00:11:57,411 --> 00:11:58,579
and a gunrunner,

201
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:02,433
and in my book, you are responsible
for the deaths of three innocent people.

202
00:12:06,388 --> 00:12:08,981
Now, in a couple of hours,
I will have a warrant

203
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:12,016
to search your garage
and your little clubhouse,

204
00:12:12,136 --> 00:12:14,886
and we'll see how enthusiastic
you are then.

205
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:20,600
Maybe I should call that lawyer of mine
after all, huh?

206
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,231
I'll set that up...
in a couple hours.

207
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:27,950
Look at that.
I just saved you 2,400 bucks.

208
00:12:30,322 --> 00:12:31,388
Jesus.

209
00:12:34,761 --> 00:12:36,311
Yeah, don't spank her.

210
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:37,577
Let's rehearse one.

211
00:12:37,697 --> 00:12:39,571
Can you believe the balls
on that little whore

212
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:41,722
showing up at the goddamn clubhouse?

213
00:12:41,884 --> 00:12:44,016
- Clay couldn't have known.
- So what?!

214
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:45,707
The rules got broken.

215
00:12:45,827 --> 00:12:48,018
What happens on a run
stays on a run.

216
00:12:48,138 --> 00:12:50,955
It does not show up and slap me
in the goddamn face.

217
00:12:51,075 --> 00:12:52,929
That does not happen to me!

218
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:00,699
She's so young.

219
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:02,638
And dumb.

220
00:13:02,904 --> 00:13:06,538
And before she knows it,
she's gonna be old and wise like us.

221
00:13:08,447 --> 00:13:10,661
How am I supposed to handle this?

222
00:13:10,878 --> 00:13:13,045
I just want to rip
his goddamn heart out.

223
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:15,177
Estrotol.

224
00:13:15,698 --> 00:13:18,768
Solution 15. It's magic. I'll get my guy
to write you a prescription.

225
00:13:18,888 --> 00:13:20,427
I didn't come here for a diagnosis.

226
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:22,915
Sure, you did.

227
00:13:23,807 --> 00:13:25,402
You're lucky, baby.

228
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,539
My walls went dry at 45.

229
00:13:28,652 --> 00:13:29,813
I'm only 51.

230
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,228
I'm not ready for this.

231
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:35,749
Stop!

232
00:13:38,314 --> 00:13:40,892
You know,
me and Saunde came up together.

233
00:13:42,012 --> 00:13:43,562
I known him 15 years.

234
00:13:45,638 --> 00:13:46,674
I'm sorry.

235
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,651
Those were your AKs, weren't they?

236
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:55,034
I think so.

237
00:13:56,326 --> 00:13:57,935
Goddamn it, Jax.

238
00:14:00,702 --> 00:14:02,152
Feds picked up Clay.

239
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:06,766
Traced a call from one of the shooters'
cell phones back to TM.

240
00:14:07,858 --> 00:14:08,890
Jesus.

241
00:14:09,396 --> 00:14:11,439
Need you to find out how real it is,

242
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,094
who else they have.

243
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:16,292
Can't let them find these guys.

244
00:14:16,412 --> 00:14:17,830
Your guns kill a friend of mine

245
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,000
and now you tasking me
to protect the shooters?

246
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,206
It's not about protecting them.

247
00:14:22,326 --> 00:14:24,476
It's about getting to them first.

248
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,621
Gotta get Clay clear of this shit.

249
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:34,229
I was supposed to help you
get your guns to the ghetto

250
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:37,524
and run a little interference.

251
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:40,845
I didn't sign on for burnt bodies...

252
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:42,769
- Dead sheriffs.
- I know.

253
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:44,039
This is over.

254
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,180
Hey, Trammel,

255
00:14:45,732 --> 00:14:47,696
it's too late for "over," man.

256
00:14:48,683 --> 00:14:51,853
You know all about us,
and we know all about you.

257
00:14:54,013 --> 00:14:57,726
Look, only way this relationship works
is two of us together...

258
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:00,426
or one of us dead.

259
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:07,780
I'll be waiting for your call.

260
00:15:16,296 --> 00:15:18,351
All right, let me call you back.

261
00:15:19,056 --> 00:15:20,674
Any luck with the warrant?

262
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,568
Sacramento says cell phones
aren't enough.

263
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:23,835
- No warrant.
- Shit!

264
00:15:23,955 --> 00:15:25,992
Maybe I can help. Agent Kohn.

265
00:15:27,347 --> 00:15:29,643
I guess Chicago doesn't have
a dress code, huh?

266
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,149
What brings you here?

267
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:33,270
I can't discuss the specifics
of my investigation.

268
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,780
Give me a break, Sparky.
This is Stockton's jurisdiction.

269
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,903
Who's your superior, Gainslay?

270
00:15:40,054 --> 00:15:41,491
I can share these.

271
00:15:44,065 --> 00:15:46,647
I followed Sons of Anarchy
to Indian Hills, Nevada last week.

272
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:48,717
War broke out with a rival MC.

273
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:50,869
Those are fully automatic handguns.

274
00:15:50,989 --> 00:15:53,248
That truck was in their lot today.

275
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:54,873
Are these oil drums?

276
00:15:56,243 --> 00:15:57,959
Well, it is illegal to transport

277
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,129
petroleum products
over state lines now, isn't it?

278
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:04,802
This is Piney Winston,
SOA's founding elder.

279
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,678
Did multiple TODs in 'Nam.

280
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,555
Guess what two guys were
in his platoon

281
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:10,461
for every re-up.

282
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:12,541
Nate Meineke and Frank Cison.

283
00:16:13,004 --> 00:16:16,438
The father of that guy
they freed from the prison transport.

284
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:20,366
Mother's little helpers.

285
00:16:21,587 --> 00:16:23,551
Get me my goddamned warrant.

286
00:16:27,192 --> 00:16:30,707
Nothing's coming up under Meineke
other than discount mufflers.

287
00:16:30,827 --> 00:16:32,077
What's going on?

288
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,333
Thought I told you
to go underground.

289
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,803
Nate, reached out.

290
00:16:37,158 --> 00:16:40,674
They're in some survivalist bunker
outside of Woodbridge Forest.

291
00:16:40,794 --> 00:16:41,630
Great.

292
00:16:41,914 --> 00:16:44,746
- You gotta set up a meet.
- And then what happens?

293
00:16:44,866 --> 00:16:46,658
They killed three people
in cold blood,

294
00:16:46,778 --> 00:16:48,645
and there's a straight line
back to this club.

295
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:51,215
What the hell you think happens,
Piney?

296
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,196
I just talked to Trammel.

297
00:16:54,316 --> 00:16:56,978
The feds got a warrant
to rip this place up.

298
00:16:57,138 --> 00:16:58,138
Shit!

299
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,773
Cabin now.

300
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:01,900
Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?

301
00:17:02,143 --> 00:17:05,249
- Relax, relax, relax!
- All right, get out of here.

302
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:15,935
You'll never be able
to get these guns out of here.

303
00:17:16,055 --> 00:17:19,421
Yeah, well, the feds open up them
oil barrels, we all got a new charter:

304
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,162
Stockton State Prison.

305
00:17:21,282 --> 00:17:24,123
Yeah, go meet with Laroy.
Pick up our money.

306
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,596
Tell him he'll have his guns
before the end of the day.

307
00:17:26,716 --> 00:17:29,636
You gonna Houdini
this stuff out of here, brother?

308
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,489
I'll figure it out.

309
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:37,060
Mrs. Teller, Estrotol
doesn't make Solution 15 anymore.

310
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,665
It's called "Menopause Plus" now.

311
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:42,571
Same amount of estrogen,
same formula, do the same thing for ya.

312
00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:46,680
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

313
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:02,359
Skinny-ass bitch.

314
00:18:13,597 --> 00:18:15,755
My God, my nose!

315
00:18:22,825 --> 00:18:23,690
My God!

316
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:29,112
Who are you?
Why'd you do that to me?!

317
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:53,239
The older I get,

318
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:56,556
the more I realized that age
doesn't bring wisdom.

319
00:18:56,716 --> 00:18:58,566
It only brings ***wearity***

320
00:18:59,008 --> 00:19:01,887
I'm not anyhow smarter
than I was 30 years ago,

321
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:03,957
I've just grown too tired

322
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:06,559
to joggle the lies
and hide the fears.

323
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:10,186
Self-awareness
doesn't reveal my indiscretions.

324
00:19:11,186 --> 00:19:12,516
Exhaustioned us.

325
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,189
What are you doing in here?

326
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
I was...

327
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:55,922
curious.

328
00:19:57,657 --> 00:20:01,521
This incubation chamber is for medical
personnel and family only.

329
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:06,589
It still hurts me.

330
00:20:14,836 --> 00:20:18,352
Be at Sam Crow in 45 minutes
if you want to see his future.

331
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:21,267
And yours, too, maybe.

332
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:32,235
- Well, Niners do not want the Aks.
- What?

333
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:36,422
Nobody's gonna touch them,
not after what went down this morning.

334
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:37,580
Man.

335
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:40,612
We'll worry about a buyer later.

336
00:20:40,732 --> 00:20:41,918
Right now,

337
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,264
it's all about the shit.

338
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:55,303
What the hell is she doing here?
She's got nothing to do with this.

339
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,928
Assaulted some girl,
hit her in the face with a skateboard.

340
00:20:58,433 --> 00:20:59,262
What?!

341
00:20:59,422 --> 00:21:01,806
- What's he doing here?
- The feds are grilling him.

342
00:21:04,202 --> 00:21:07,056
- What the hell did you do?!
- Same thing you did:

343
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:10,023
- nailed some little tart from Nevada!
- Like I don't have enough shit

344
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,325
oozing out of my ears!
You got to go and do this!

345
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:15,559
Should've thought of that before
your dick went on a cheerleader hunt!

346
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,477
- I didn't tell her to come here!
- But she's here!

347
00:21:18,817 --> 00:21:21,833
- Well, that's not my fault!
- And it's not my pussy!

348
00:21:25,037 --> 00:21:26,903
And that's why I'm single.

349
00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:35,989
You hungry?

350
00:21:38,181 --> 00:21:39,577
I'll take a smoke.

351
00:21:57,506 --> 00:21:58,506
What?

352
00:21:59,925 --> 00:22:03,803
When you were our paperboy,
you had that same goofy haircut.

353
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,206
That was a long time ago.

354
00:22:09,865 --> 00:22:12,733
Last time I was in here,
I was 18 years old.

355
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,606
What'd they get you for?

356
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,241
Disorderly conduct.

357
00:22:19,064 --> 00:22:20,400
I was piss-drunk.

358
00:22:21,171 --> 00:22:24,556
Think there might have been an,
an assault charge involved, too.

359
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:27,392
Yeah, well, go figure?

360
00:22:32,674 --> 00:22:34,565
What do the feds want with Clay?

361
00:22:34,942 --> 00:22:37,192
What do you think they want him for?

362
00:22:40,757 --> 00:22:42,404
Thanks for the smoke.

363
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,529
We're heading out.

364
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:50,121
Okay.

365
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:08,246
Get on the ground!

366
00:23:09,052 --> 00:23:11,394
Hands where I can see them!
Come on. Let's go!

367
00:23:11,865 --> 00:23:13,127
Face on the pavement.

368
00:23:13,247 --> 00:23:15,091
Spread your legs.

369
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:17,981
Check the bar license also.

370
00:23:18,101 --> 00:23:19,533
Gullies are clean.

371
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:29,913
Clear for storage unit.

372
00:23:31,517 --> 00:23:32,732
You smell nice.

373
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:51,930
Nate called.

374
00:24:52,496 --> 00:24:54,950
Wants to make a deal
on the rest of those Aks.

375
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,394
Russell knows nobody will touch them.
Ten grand for all 36.

376
00:24:58,514 --> 00:25:01,713
Shit. Those guns are worth
ten times that.

377
00:25:04,451 --> 00:25:06,001
All right, set it up.

378
00:25:06,524 --> 00:25:08,481
Me and Ope will make the run.

379
00:25:08,601 --> 00:25:10,568
Now, you can't go without me.

380
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,240
They won't trust you.

381
00:25:18,432 --> 00:25:20,582
You okay tying up this loose end?

382
00:25:23,332 --> 00:25:25,882
You know,
you don't have to ask me that.

383
00:25:26,596 --> 00:25:27,604
All right.

384
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,928
This is the one.

385
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:47,296
Step back, boys.

386
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:56,159
Jesus!

387
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,504
Get the guns!

388
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,252
Get the guns!

389
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,035
Found six of these in his garage.

390
00:26:14,195 --> 00:26:18,150
I'm guessing this is how they're getting
their guns into the country.

391
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,516
Dungloe, Ireland?

392
00:26:20,864 --> 00:26:22,973
True IRA territory.

393
00:26:23,438 --> 00:26:24,653
Outlaw Irish.

394
00:26:25,328 --> 00:26:27,263
This could be huge, Deputy.

395
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:31,711
If the Sons of Anarchy are running guns
through a known terrorist organization,

396
00:26:31,831 --> 00:26:34,345
well, then that puts
your little motorcycle club on

397
00:26:34,465 --> 00:26:37,325
at least a half a dozen
federal watch lists.

398
00:26:38,145 --> 00:26:40,790
My nipples are unbelievably
hard right now.

399
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,793
I'm gonna pull
in Homeland Security, Treasury.

400
00:26:44,421 --> 00:26:47,471
We might just shut
this Harley Mafia down for good.

401
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,077
I'll be in touch.

402
00:26:49,197 --> 00:26:51,170
Did you brief Agent Kohn on this?

403
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,246
You know, I called Chicago,

404
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:57,329
and, Kohn's supervisor seems to think
he's on vacation in Oregon.

405
00:26:57,667 --> 00:26:59,726
Let me know if he stirs anything up
with Sam Crow,

406
00:26:59,846 --> 00:27:01,854
and keep this inside your khakis.

407
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,252
Clay Morrow's free to go.

408
00:27:32,364 --> 00:27:34,783
Hale says
you don't want bail posted.

409
00:27:38,477 --> 00:27:39,586
That's right.

410
00:27:40,777 --> 00:27:42,505
Just need a little me time.

411
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,620
Well,

412
00:27:48,388 --> 00:27:51,091
I'll stay at the clubhouse.
I don't want you in here.

413
00:27:52,232 --> 00:27:54,382
I don't give a shit what you want.

414
00:27:57,715 --> 00:27:58,715
Right.

415
00:28:09,284 --> 00:28:11,431
I can't take back what happened.

416
00:28:13,908 --> 00:28:16,442
Should never have gone down
like this.

417
00:28:20,975 --> 00:28:21,975
I'm sorry.

418
00:28:27,566 --> 00:28:29,016
Won't happen again.

419
00:28:30,654 --> 00:28:31,674
I promise.

420
00:28:46,453 --> 00:28:47,963
What are you doing?

421
00:28:49,632 --> 00:28:51,233
You're staying?
So am I.

422
00:28:57,637 --> 00:28:59,626
I'm going through menopause, Clay.

423
00:29:02,553 --> 00:29:03,872
You know what that means?

424
00:29:08,711 --> 00:29:10,527
Means things are changing.

425
00:29:12,788 --> 00:29:13,788
Yeah.

426
00:29:17,762 --> 00:29:19,712
You know what doesn't change?

427
00:29:24,176 --> 00:29:25,696
The love I got for you.

428
00:29:43,613 --> 00:29:44,613
Go home.

429
00:29:47,098 --> 00:29:49,167
Just pick me up in the morning.

430
00:30:08,738 --> 00:30:11,272
I'm really sorry, Kip.

431
00:30:12,238 --> 00:30:14,835
I'm really sorry
if I got people in trouble.

432
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:17,181
Can't let a club president

433
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:21,162
have a time with you, and then
you show up a week later, you know,

434
00:30:21,852 --> 00:30:24,402
especially with his old lady
on the lot.

435
00:30:25,192 --> 00:30:26,192
I know,

436
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,749
but I'm not here for Clay.

437
00:30:32,323 --> 00:30:35,213
You have any thoughts about
pressing charges against Gemma?

438
00:30:35,373 --> 00:30:37,116
Never.
I'm not going to.

439
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,915
Anybody asks, you don't know anything
about what went down in Indian Hills.

440
00:30:45,035 --> 00:30:47,494
Nothing.
I know the way it works.

441
00:30:49,956 --> 00:30:51,062
Good.

442
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,694
Why the hell did you get
in that cargo truck?

443
00:30:59,581 --> 00:31:00,791
You know why.

444
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:03,798
No, no,

445
00:31:03,918 --> 00:31:05,114
Jesus, that...

446
00:31:05,234 --> 00:31:06,745
that can't work, you understand.

447
00:31:07,388 --> 00:31:08,493
Look, look.

448
00:31:09,379 --> 00:31:13,213
Okay, look, that can't work, okay,
not after what went down.

449
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,236
Just give me one more dance.

450
00:31:19,689 --> 00:31:21,343
I can take it from there.

451
00:31:21,585 --> 00:31:23,735
I don't think that's a good idea.

452
00:31:24,555 --> 00:31:26,388
- No?
- No, 'cause you know...

453
00:31:40,454 --> 00:31:41,660
Welcome home.

454
00:31:43,187 --> 00:31:44,535
Welcome back, bro.

455
00:31:46,152 --> 00:31:47,202
Welcome home.

456
00:31:47,362 --> 00:31:48,760
The dough is here.

457
00:31:52,721 --> 00:31:56,285
Feds trashed the clubhouse,
but the search turned up nothing.

458
00:31:56,621 --> 00:31:58,296
- We got the guns out.
- No, wait a minute.

459
00:31:58,694 --> 00:32:00,813
Jackie Boy got all the guns out.

460
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:04,042
Good.

461
00:32:09,109 --> 00:32:11,278
ATF's got shit.
It's all smoke.

462
00:32:12,027 --> 00:32:13,948
Yeah, they're onto the oil barrels.

463
00:32:14,068 --> 00:32:15,197
Yeah, well,

464
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:18,858
we'll just have to find a smarter
way to get the guns in is all.

465
00:32:19,018 --> 00:32:21,368
By the time the warehouse
is rebuilt,

466
00:32:21,963 --> 00:32:24,876
we'll be a distant memory
for the AT&F.

467
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:27,292
Mom home?

468
00:32:28,563 --> 00:32:30,513
She wouldn't let me post bail.

469
00:32:31,056 --> 00:32:32,056
Shit.

470
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:35,375
She is pissed.

471
00:32:36,793 --> 00:32:38,215
Yeah, that she is.

472
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:41,155
Well, we're handling
Meineke and his crew.

473
00:32:41,275 --> 00:32:42,757
Piney set up a meet for tomorrow.

474
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:46,054
- We're gonna clean this up.
- Yeah, well, I'm tired

475
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:47,555
and my head hurts,

476
00:32:49,153 --> 00:32:50,765
and you'll handle it.

477
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,410
I'm just going to crash here
tonight.

478
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,857
We'll talk in the daylight.

479
00:32:59,489 --> 00:33:00,836
In the daylight.

480
00:33:12,602 --> 00:33:14,047
We're not idiots.

481
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,256
We weren't followed.

482
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:23,063
That smells like shit.

483
00:33:24,142 --> 00:33:25,409
Long story.

484
00:33:26,612 --> 00:33:28,044
They're all here.

485
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:29,548
Three dozen.

486
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:33,850
Cut open the bags and you can
check for yourself if you like.

487
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,238
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

488
00:33:51,017 --> 00:33:53,217
Sorry about how this went down.
I wanted to tell you,

489
00:33:53,337 --> 00:33:55,375
but Russ thought it best not to.

490
00:33:57,483 --> 00:33:59,869
That Russ,
he always was a big thinker.

491
00:34:00,723 --> 00:34:04,047
He's a good kid, just a little nervous.
Believes in the cause.

492
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,175
And this is your retirement plan?

493
00:34:07,954 --> 00:34:09,704
Hiding out in some bunker?

494
00:34:12,407 --> 00:34:14,518
You got anybody up there with you?

495
00:34:14,638 --> 00:34:15,638
Family,

496
00:34:15,895 --> 00:34:16,959
women, kids?

497
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:20,424
No. Frank and Russ' boys.

498
00:34:21,501 --> 00:34:23,302
We're gonna lie low
till the heat dies down.

499
00:34:23,422 --> 00:34:25,498
We got some big boy
waiting for us in Mexico.

500
00:34:25,618 --> 00:34:26,618
Mexico.

501
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,890
Gonna be running
this revolution from Acapulco?

502
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:31,986
Yeah.

503
00:34:47,101 --> 00:34:48,101
You,

504
00:34:50,233 --> 00:34:52,133
take care of yourself, friend.

505
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:14,743
Well, there...
ain't no innocents with 'em.

506
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:59,636
All this shit landed on your back.

507
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,332
Handled it pretty damn good, kid.

508
00:36:03,548 --> 00:36:04,798
Thanks, old man.

509
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,396
I heard Clay
got clear of everything.

510
00:36:35,516 --> 00:36:37,982
Yeah.
Thanks for the heads-up.

511
00:36:39,036 --> 00:36:41,579
There's a little gratitude
bump in the envelope.

512
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:42,739
Okay.

513
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:48,689
The guys that killed your friend--
that's been taken care of.

514
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:51,422
Shit like that won't happen again.

515
00:36:56,059 --> 00:36:57,397
We together here?

516
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,500
Yeah.

517
00:37:00,678 --> 00:37:02,281
One big happy family.

518
00:37:21,546 --> 00:37:24,164
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah. Why?

519
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,818
I was going past the clubhouse
yesterday. I saw all these cops.

520
00:37:27,938 --> 00:37:29,591
That was a bunch of bullshit.

521
00:37:29,711 --> 00:37:32,069
We got this ATF agent harassing us.

522
00:37:32,189 --> 00:37:34,125
Following me. Showed up here.

523
00:37:34,245 --> 00:37:37,347
The guy's nuts. He's looking for
dirt that doesn't exist.

524
00:37:40,743 --> 00:37:44,100
I'm, I'm just finishing up my rounds.
Do you mind giving me a ride home?

525
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,060
Sure.

526
00:37:45,608 --> 00:37:46,858
What's going on?

527
00:37:47,868 --> 00:37:50,210
Shitty day.
My nerves are kind of shot.

528
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,567
Well, I'll be with the kid.

529
00:37:54,144 --> 00:37:55,144
Thanks.

530
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:16,124
- You been waiting long?
- All my life, baby.

531
00:38:29,716 --> 00:38:30,605
Jesus.

532
00:38:31,623 --> 00:38:33,225
This stupid bitch.

533
00:38:35,211 --> 00:38:37,361
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, I got it.

534
00:38:40,048 --> 00:38:41,917
No skateboards.
Promise.

535
00:38:45,905 --> 00:38:49,251
I just want to say I'm sorry
if I caused any problems.

536
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,990
Why the hell are you here?

537
00:38:53,989 --> 00:38:55,800
You and him.
I want that.

538
00:38:57,624 --> 00:38:59,728
- The prospect?
- Yeah.

539
00:39:00,976 --> 00:39:02,222
He's the right one.

540
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:05,797
What if that doesn't hook up?
The others want a taste?

541
00:39:06,212 --> 00:39:08,962
Then I'm gone.
I'm not here for anyone else.

542
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:13,423
You so much as flash
a pretty grin at him,

543
00:39:13,996 --> 00:39:16,894
I will jam my fist
so far up your bony ass,

544
00:39:17,014 --> 00:39:18,612
your cup size will double.

545
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,090
Is that how your rack
got to be that size?

546
00:39:25,887 --> 00:39:28,458
- Not a good time to be clever.
- Yes, ma'am.

547
00:39:30,141 --> 00:39:32,335
I promise: I'm clear of your man.

548
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:34,854
Not even a smile.

549
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,777
You'll heal okay.

550
00:39:40,035 --> 00:39:40,884
Yeah?

551
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:43,149
And you?

552
00:39:45,465 --> 00:39:46,580
I'll be fine.

553
00:39:54,155 --> 00:39:55,605
Work everything out?

554
00:39:56,007 --> 00:39:58,626
Relax.
A threesome ain't gonna happen.

555
00:39:59,646 --> 00:40:03,538
- Did I say anything about a threesome?
- You are so transparent.

556
00:40:03,658 --> 00:40:04,793
Take me home.

557
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:06,866
Yes, ma'am.

558
00:40:32,734 --> 00:40:33,902
You allright?

559
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:50,567
