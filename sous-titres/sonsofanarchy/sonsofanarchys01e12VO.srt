1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:02,967
Previously on Sons of Anarchy...

2
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:05,670
We need to think about this.
What the hell are we doing?

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,106
Your mom says
that I have to end this.

4
00:00:08,231 --> 00:00:10,717
I want you to stop listening
to my crazy mom.

5
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:13,465
- Someone's here to see you.
- You left rehab?

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,639
No. I'm moving into
a sober living house.

7
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:17,840
You want to stay until you check in?

8
00:00:17,965 --> 00:00:21,213
- You want this family back together?
- It's the only thing I want.

9
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:24,384
I will do whatever I can
to help make that happen.

10
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:27,590
Cameron was supposed to kill
that piece of shit Hefner.

11
00:00:27,715 --> 00:00:29,622
I want Ope
pulling the trigger on this.

12
00:00:29,747 --> 00:00:30,780
No mistakes.

13
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:31,781
Shit.

14
00:00:32,497 --> 00:00:35,033
Robert Munson, you're under arrest
for the murder of Brenan Hefner.

15
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:36,910
ATF says they got an eyewitness.

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,039
Only two other guys
were witness to that hit.

17
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,499
- Where's Ope?
- He checked Opie's finances.

18
00:00:42,669 --> 00:00:45,779
Somebody paid off a huge chunk
of his debt. Federal wire transfer.

19
00:00:45,904 --> 00:00:47,514
I figured the least

20
00:00:47,843 --> 00:00:51,091
I could do was pay off
some of those big bills of yours.

21
00:00:51,278 --> 00:00:54,386
- You're setting me up as the rat.
- What is going to happen

22
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:56,763
when I put you and your family
back in Charming?

23
00:00:57,028 --> 00:00:59,724
I tell the club the truth.
I know how this looks.

24
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:02,686
She set me up to look like a rat.
It's all a lie.

25
00:01:02,856 --> 00:01:06,065
I don't know who the hell
the witness is, but sure shit ain't me.

26
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,234
- Am I good with you, Clay?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,901
His truck was wired.

28
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,446
Opie has turned on us.

29
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:14,601
This has got to happen, Clay.

30
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:18,064
This death never lands at our feet.

31
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:51,216
I love you.

32
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:20,144
Sometimes I think you love
that bird more than me.

33
00:02:22,484 --> 00:02:23,787
Sometimes I do.

34
00:03:01,972 --> 00:03:03,299
Get out of here.

35
00:03:04,438 --> 00:03:05,688
Go on. Beat it.

36
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:47,074
Told you not to do that shit here.
Get out of here!

37
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,199
Go on!

38
00:03:48,631 --> 00:03:50,436
- Get out!
- Crazy old shithead!

39
00:04:19,507 --> 00:04:21,597
It's your lucky day, little boy.

40
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:23,673
You get to join your family.

41
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:02,756
Episode 112: The Sleep of Babies

42
00:05:13,903 --> 00:05:17,066
The meeting's all set.
Oakland, 2:30.

43
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:18,581
Good.

44
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,113
If Opie's wired,

45
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,436
there's no way in hell we're gonna be
able to separate him from everybody,

46
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:28,868
everything we're doing.

47
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,098
We gotta protect our guys.

48
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,201
It's gotta happen today.

49
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
Okay.

50
00:05:45,316 --> 00:05:47,018
The tracker on Opie's pickup
is working,

51
00:05:47,143 --> 00:05:49,289
but we're not getting anything
from the bug or the cell.

52
00:05:49,414 --> 00:05:52,287
Check his truck when you can. He
might've been smart enough to sweep it.

53
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:54,894
What if Clay
or one of the others found it?

54
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:59,351
The pretrial for Hefner's murder
starts tomorrow.

55
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:01,786
US Attorney'll have to release
the name of the witness.

56
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:04,224
So, Sam Crow will know
that Opie isn't the snitch,

57
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:07,700
and we can start making our case
tying him to Hefner's killing.

58
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:10,535
Just have to keep him safe
for another 24

59
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,253
- and then we can arrest his shaggy ass.
- I know she's here.

60
00:06:13,378 --> 00:06:14,623
I want to see her!

61
00:06:15,014 --> 00:06:16,989
Clay Morrow wants to see you.

62
00:06:20,065 --> 00:06:21,065
It's okay.

63
00:06:27,814 --> 00:06:29,290
You kick down my doors.

64
00:06:29,415 --> 00:06:30,865
You hurt my wife...

65
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:34,892
You lock up one of my brothers
for a crime he didn't commit.

66
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,015
We'll let a jury of his peers
decide that.

67
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,303
What you did to Opie
and his family proves one thing.

68
00:06:40,846 --> 00:06:42,196
You're desperate.

69
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:44,444
'Cause you got nothing on us.

70
00:06:46,302 --> 00:06:48,098
It kills you, doesn't it?

71
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:51,877
To see me and my guys
living good lives.

72
00:06:52,655 --> 00:06:54,780
Families, friends, nice homes.

73
00:06:56,352 --> 00:06:57,702
You hate the fact

74
00:06:58,102 --> 00:07:01,152
that we get the same rights
and freedoms as you do.

75
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:02,851
Gee.

76
00:07:03,662 --> 00:07:06,112
You make me so proud
to be an American.

77
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:11,148
You're a fascist pig,

78
00:07:12,036 --> 00:07:13,686
and what Otto did to you

79
00:07:14,427 --> 00:07:16,225
is just the tip of the iceberg.

80
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:28,155
We're good.

81
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,034
Our retainer with Rosen's good
for one more week,

82
00:07:32,312 --> 00:07:34,244
but if this thing
with Bobby goes to trial,

83
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,723
we're gonna have to pony up
some serious up-front cash.

84
00:07:36,848 --> 00:07:38,852
We have every dime
in the warehouse rebuild.

85
00:07:38,977 --> 00:07:39,832
I know.

86
00:07:41,165 --> 00:07:42,615
I talked to Alvarez.

87
00:07:42,908 --> 00:07:44,912
The Mayans want guns.
They want them right away.

88
00:07:45,037 --> 00:07:48,346
We ain't got nothing to sell. Irish
don't start shipping till next month.

89
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:50,726
We pull our security surplus.
We sell 'em those.

90
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:51,969
Wait a minute.

91
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,846
I thought we didn't sell
that surplus.

92
00:07:54,165 --> 00:07:55,165
We don't.

93
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,415
We sell 'em those guns.
It's a goodwill gesture.

94
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,744
Mayans turn around,
place a big order.

95
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:02,100
They give us
half the cash in advance.

96
00:08:02,225 --> 00:08:04,103
Leaves us
nothing to protect the club.

97
00:08:04,228 --> 00:08:06,025
I'm out of ideas here, Jax.

98
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:08,539
If we don't jump on this deal,
we lose it.

99
00:08:08,664 --> 00:08:10,364
I'm just trying to help Bobby here.

100
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,851
I get that, but ATF are still camped out
in Unser's office.

101
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:15,493
- You really want to take that risk?
- We can do this smart.

102
00:08:16,354 --> 00:08:19,004
We set up two locations
in Oakland, right?

103
00:08:19,852 --> 00:08:22,583
We pick up the money from one,
we drop off the guns at the other.

104
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,791
This way even if the feds
are watching us,

105
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,666
they never see money for guns.

106
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,789
Why would the feds
still be trailing us?

107
00:08:28,914 --> 00:08:31,259
Maybe they're pissed off
'cause you didn't turn.

108
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:34,541
You and Tig pick up the money.
Me and Jax drop off the guns.

109
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,456
I'll go with Ope and Tig.

110
00:08:37,794 --> 00:08:39,100
Fewer the better.

111
00:08:39,225 --> 00:08:40,775
Why don't you just...

112
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,355
go up to the warehouse,
let me know how that's going.

113
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,159
Some bullshit errand.

114
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:52,203
I got stuff to do.

115
00:09:05,868 --> 00:09:07,781
I think that's all of them.

116
00:09:08,204 --> 00:09:10,341
It's just some liability stuff.

117
00:09:17,463 --> 00:09:18,764
Is something wrong?

118
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:21,244
With Abel leaving, I just...

119
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,604
realize it's not just you.

120
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,293
You have a son.

121
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,653
We need to think
about what we're doing.

122
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:35,573
Man, you really want
to talk about this, huh?

123
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,596
Was the one upside of Wendy:

124
00:09:38,721 --> 00:09:41,154
she was usually too wasted
for relationship chats.

125
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,758
I'm painfully sober.

126
00:09:44,354 --> 00:09:45,604
I can see that.

127
00:09:48,914 --> 00:09:51,064
I'm not getting out of this, am I?

128
00:10:00,773 --> 00:10:02,604
That shit was crazy, Tara.

129
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:04,988
That "I gotta be with you
every minute

130
00:10:05,113 --> 00:10:06,879
or I'm gonna kill myself"
type of crazy.

131
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:08,004
I know.

132
00:10:08,977 --> 00:10:11,341
Look, the way I feel about you,

133
00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:13,142
it hasn't changed.

134
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,817
I could still go there.

135
00:10:16,918 --> 00:10:18,324
But this can't be that.

136
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,701
So we gotta figure out what's right.

137
00:10:21,728 --> 00:10:24,578
But I'm not trying to avoid this.
What we have.

138
00:10:26,104 --> 00:10:28,418
It's just gonna, you know,
take a minute

139
00:10:28,543 --> 00:10:30,065
to know what to do.

140
00:10:33,793 --> 00:10:35,389
You can have a minute.

141
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,229
Where you been?

142
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:02,159
Here, take the other end.

143
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:10,095
I know what you're doing.

144
00:11:10,894 --> 00:11:12,267
Hanging a banner?

145
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,444
With me and Tara.

146
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,270
And what am I doing?

147
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:22,979
Using me...

148
00:11:23,945 --> 00:11:25,391
to hurt her and Jax.

149
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,355
Asking me if I still love him,
do I want my family together?

150
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,530
That was all about
pushing her out of the picture.

151
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:33,363
Doesn't change anything.

152
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:35,929
Still meant everything I said.

153
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:39,480
What do you care
what my motives are?

154
00:11:39,605 --> 00:11:42,355
You still get the thing
you want the most...

155
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,842
and so do I.

156
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,212
I was okay with you slipping me
enough crank to kill a horse.

157
00:11:48,337 --> 00:11:51,265
Because of what I did to Abel,
I deserved that,

158
00:11:51,689 --> 00:11:54,253
but I am not the same person
I was two months ago.

159
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:56,173
I can't be a part of this.

160
00:11:56,707 --> 00:11:58,527
You're playing
with people's lives, Gemma.

161
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,582
I'm protecting the innocent.

162
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,468
If I step on a few toes
in the meanwhile, so be it.

163
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:07,391
Jesus, you really believe that,
don't you?

164
00:12:10,492 --> 00:12:11,543
So, what?

165
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,526
Putting down that needle
for a few weeks

166
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,984
somehow gives you
the right to judge me?

167
00:12:18,311 --> 00:12:21,200
You better take a good,
long look, sweetheart,

168
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:23,602
'cause you are burning a hole

169
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:26,732
through the very thing
you can't wait to become.

170
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:32,375
Maybe that's why
you hate yourself so much.

171
00:12:37,664 --> 00:12:39,385
Sooner you accept that,

172
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,670
sooner you put down
this holy crutch.

173
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:46,666
Jesus...

174
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:50,959
is just a guy who cuts my lawn.

175
00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:01,917
If you need anything,
I just want you to ask Agent Yost,

176
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:04,978
- who will be staying with you. Okay?
- When does the trial begin?

177
00:13:05,103 --> 00:13:07,089
We don't know exactly, but soon.

178
00:13:07,214 --> 00:13:10,311
- Is it going to take a long time?
- I'm not sure.

179
00:13:10,653 --> 00:13:12,946
Look, don't worry, okay?
We have sheriffs on the street.

180
00:13:13,071 --> 00:13:14,986
I have my people staying with you.

181
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:17,253
It'll all be over before you know it,
all right?

182
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:18,805
Come on.

183
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:31,613
You think this a bad idea.

184
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,044
Yeah, I do.

185
00:13:34,572 --> 00:13:36,863
Clay made the deal with the Mayans

186
00:13:36,988 --> 00:13:39,641
to make sure the war
didn't reach Charming.

187
00:13:39,766 --> 00:13:41,673
It's bigger than that, man.

188
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:43,404
What?

189
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:45,480
Let's just get this done.

190
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,952
Hang on. If you think
I'm walking into something...

191
00:13:58,119 --> 00:13:59,712
Look at the last few months, man.

192
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:02,331
Our warehouse gets blown up.

193
00:14:03,228 --> 00:14:05,824
Mayans try to kill Clay.
Bobby's in jail.

194
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,760
We got ATF trying
to stick RICO up our ass.

195
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:11,765
How much longer
you think this club's got?

196
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,581
We're better than this, man.

197
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:17,980
My old man.

198
00:14:19,348 --> 00:14:21,269
He saw the nightmare coming.

199
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,777
He was smart, Ope,
way smarter than me.

200
00:14:26,388 --> 00:14:28,282
He had ideas
about where to take the club.

201
00:14:28,725 --> 00:14:29,725
You know?

202
00:14:30,145 --> 00:14:31,821
Legitimate ways to earn.

203
00:14:33,353 --> 00:14:34,353
He knew

204
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:37,708
that Sam Crow
has got to change to survive.

205
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:41,128
Clay'll never walk away
from running guns.

206
00:14:43,898 --> 00:14:44,931
I know.

207
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,642
He's made that very clear.

208
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:51,183
A few more years...

209
00:14:51,693 --> 00:14:54,934
He won't be able to turn the throttle,
and you'll be #1.

210
00:14:56,848 --> 00:14:58,203
And Bobby and Tig?

211
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:00,913
Pushing them in a new direction?

212
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:02,228
Jesus Christ.

213
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:06,009
Two immovable objects.

214
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,447
Irresistible force.

215
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:10,248
It could happen.

216
00:15:12,867 --> 00:15:14,628
- Donna's here.
- Thanks.

217
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:21,003
Probably best not to greet her
with two bags of guns.

218
00:15:33,168 --> 00:15:36,475
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- No, it's all right. What's up, baby?

219
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:40,732
Your mom wants to take the kids
to Funtown and then to dinner.

220
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,232
I didn't want to say yes
until I talked to you.

221
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,584
Mom's volunteering
to spend time with the kids?

222
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:50,406
I guess she had
a good time with them.

223
00:15:51,532 --> 00:15:53,855
You really should talk to her, Ope.

224
00:15:54,915 --> 00:15:58,539
I think she's just finding excuses
to stay around until she sees you.

225
00:16:00,892 --> 00:16:01,892
Maybe.

226
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,721
She can take the kids.

227
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,989
It means we'll have the house
to ourselves for a while.

228
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,150
Shit.

229
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:21,959
Jax is having a party for Abel.
It's a homecoming thing.

230
00:16:22,342 --> 00:16:23,968
You don't have to go,

231
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,010
but I got to swing by
and drop off a gift.

232
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,246
I want to go.

233
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:32,574
Abel coming home is a big deal.
Our family should be there.

234
00:16:33,112 --> 00:16:34,145
We should.

235
00:16:36,893 --> 00:16:38,071
I'd like that.

236
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:41,040
I'll tell Mary to bring the kids home
before dinner.

237
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,218
BAILOUT MY KIDS WE NEED FOOD

238
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,562
- You really doing this for your kids?
- Yes, ma'am.

239
00:17:03,946 --> 00:17:05,132
Got two boys.

240
00:17:06,095 --> 00:17:07,856
Uncle Sam cut off my aid.

241
00:17:08,543 --> 00:17:09,543
Again.

242
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:12,564
You look pretty able-bodied to me.

243
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,295
There's got to be something better
you can be doing

244
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,793
than holding up clever signs
and begging.

245
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:21,368
Hard for me
to hold down a job, ma'am.

246
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:23,558
Account of the mental illness.

247
00:17:24,422 --> 00:17:26,395
Tend to fly into rages,

248
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:28,629
no apparent reason.

249
00:17:30,293 --> 00:17:32,583
Since when is that a mental illness?

250
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:41,393
Don't shoot this into your arm.

251
00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:44,078
That's kind and generous.

252
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:45,896
Thank you, ma'am.

253
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,566
Abel will help my little boys.

254
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,450
What?

255
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,779
Able to help my little boys.

256
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:01,536
Bless you.

257
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:12,157
Glad you're still in one piece.

258
00:18:13,546 --> 00:18:15,396
Been a real exciting month.

259
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,707
Should I be worried
about eyes on us?

260
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:21,598
Nobody knows I'm here.

261
00:18:22,547 --> 00:18:24,097
Including my own crew.

262
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:26,508
Shit looks serious, man.

263
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:29,441
- What's giving you worry?
- It was Alvarez

264
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:32,095
that tried to off me.

265
00:18:32,623 --> 00:18:33,623
I need

266
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:38,096
to buy some time,
prevent the war from hitting Charming.

267
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:40,951
Told him I'd sell him some guns.

268
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:44,831
- You're selling to the Mayans?
- That's why you and me are talking.

269
00:18:47,448 --> 00:18:50,135
There's a meet arranged
for this afternoon.

270
00:18:51,512 --> 00:18:54,047
Alvarez thinks he'll be getting
his first gun shipment.

271
00:18:55,766 --> 00:18:56,766
He ain't.

272
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,922
Time and locations of the deal.

273
00:19:02,047 --> 00:19:04,097
Guns at one, money at the other.

274
00:19:05,921 --> 00:19:08,771
I want you and your crew
to step on both ends.

275
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,800
I put a bullet in Alvarez,

276
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:14,149
you drop as many wetbacks
as you can.

277
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:20,673
And why in the good Lord's name
would I be doing your dirty work?

278
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:23,084
You keep the guns,

279
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:24,959
I keep the money,

280
00:19:25,588 --> 00:19:26,588
and,

281
00:19:27,422 --> 00:19:28,433
this FUBAR

282
00:19:28,856 --> 00:19:31,721
helps move our relationship
back to monogamous.

283
00:19:33,658 --> 00:19:35,736
I know you've been buying guns
from the Russians.

284
00:19:35,861 --> 00:19:37,925
Three times the markup,
half the selection.

285
00:19:38,108 --> 00:19:40,754
If you want to waste your
hard-earned heroin money on that shit,

286
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,055
you be my guest.

287
00:19:43,052 --> 00:19:45,516
I'll feed the competition
with the better bullet.

288
00:19:49,107 --> 00:19:50,646
What are the weapons?

289
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:54,293
AKs, MAC-10s, combat shotguns.

290
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:56,747
About $25K worth of hardware.

291
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:03,046
All right.

292
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:08,956
We'll make the deal,

293
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,193
and then you wait till me
and my crew are safe and clear.

294
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:16,471
Then join the party.

295
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:24,388
Hey, look,

296
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,039
I understand the need to make
an executive decision

297
00:20:27,164 --> 00:20:28,761
for the good of the club.
I get it.

298
00:20:28,886 --> 00:20:31,044
The Opie thing makes
sense to me, but this...

299
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:34,375
We have made a club-wide
peace with the Mayans...

300
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,118
The peace stays intact.
The Mayans are going to think that

301
00:20:37,243 --> 00:20:40,742
the Niners got their intel
off the street, stepped on the deal.

302
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:44,049
Then, all we got to do is
spin the angry black man story.

303
00:20:44,607 --> 00:20:47,501
- Play the niggers against the wetbacks.
- I like it.

304
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:51,527
How do we handle our other problem?

305
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:53,834
Just before the Niners jump in,

306
00:20:54,608 --> 00:20:57,004
put a bullet in
the back of Opie's head.

307
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:00,400
This way, even if ATF
crashes the party,

308
00:21:00,618 --> 00:21:02,204
there's no illegal guns

309
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:06,346
and Opie looks like the victim
of gangland violence.

310
00:21:06,796 --> 00:21:08,765
And we blame the angry black man.

311
00:21:09,046 --> 00:21:10,637
It's the American way.

312
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,322
Donna took the truck to get groceries.
I checked it.

313
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:26,074
Bug's been ripped out.
And Opie's cell is dead.

314
00:21:26,726 --> 00:21:27,953
Clay found it.

315
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:30,578
Thinks Opie's working for us.

316
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,415
That's what this morning was.

317
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:36,043
He's feeling guilty about
what he might have to do.

318
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:38,887
- How do we handle this?
- Put an extra team on him.

319
00:21:39,012 --> 00:21:41,882
- We have to keep Opie in one piece.
- I'm on it.

320
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:50,502
- I'll meet you back there.
- Okay. Take care.

321
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:53,909
- You looking for me?
- Yeah.

322
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,896
I need to ask you a question.

323
00:21:56,863 --> 00:21:57,863
Okay.

324
00:21:58,647 --> 00:21:59,914
Are you with Jax?

325
00:22:03,081 --> 00:22:06,245
- I don't how to answer that.
- Do you love him?

326
00:22:08,606 --> 00:22:10,786
I'm not comfortable having
this conversation with you.

327
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:13,562
I don't give a shit
what you're comfortable with.

328
00:22:13,687 --> 00:22:16,120
We've spoken over a half a dozen
times in the past couple of days.

329
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:19,747
You don't think you might have mentioned
that you're sleeping with my husband?

330
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:20,880
Ex-husband.

331
00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:24,657
Two more months
before that's official, okay?

332
00:22:24,782 --> 00:22:27,341
He's my husband,
and Abel is our son.

333
00:22:27,466 --> 00:22:30,973
You need to check into your sober-living
facility, get some time.

334
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,817
If you and Jax
are supposed to be together,

335
00:22:33,942 --> 00:22:35,560
he'll be there when you get out.

336
00:22:37,335 --> 00:22:38,885
And where will you be?

337
00:22:41,683 --> 00:22:43,777
I have to get back to work.

338
00:22:45,544 --> 00:22:47,707
She'll never let you be with him.

339
00:22:48,275 --> 00:22:49,562
Gemma hates you.

340
00:22:50,383 --> 00:22:52,953
She'll do whatever she can
to keep you guys apart.

341
00:22:54,655 --> 00:22:57,133
May as well quit
while you're still ahead.

342
00:22:57,629 --> 00:22:59,697
Or alive, for that matter.

343
00:23:05,691 --> 00:23:07,341
Let me borrow your cell.

344
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:09,370
I got to check in with Donna.

345
00:23:12,498 --> 00:23:13,498
Thanks.

346
00:23:14,002 --> 00:23:16,191
Found mine in a pitcher of beer.

347
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:20,069
- You know anything about that?
- Maybe it was thirsty.

348
00:23:21,562 --> 00:23:23,212
You ever see your kids?

349
00:23:24,764 --> 00:23:26,224
Once or twice a year.

350
00:23:27,632 --> 00:23:28,697
That hard for you?

351
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:30,734
Used to be.

352
00:23:31,768 --> 00:23:33,278
Two girls, right?

353
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,146
Dawn and Fawn.

354
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,048
Yeah, I know.

355
00:23:42,085 --> 00:23:43,295
It's voicemail.
Thanks.

356
00:23:58,209 --> 00:23:59,352
You're early.

357
00:23:59,694 --> 00:24:01,713
You ain't early.
You're late.

358
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:53,038
What?

359
00:24:54,433 --> 00:24:55,849
I hate dolls, man.

360
00:24:57,642 --> 00:24:59,763
- They creep me out.
- Back here.

361
00:24:59,888 --> 00:25:02,249
That's a story
that needs to be told.

362
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,507
You go.

363
00:25:14,168 --> 00:25:15,618
That's 30 for these.

364
00:25:16,024 --> 00:25:18,265
30 upfront for the order next month.

365
00:25:18,821 --> 00:25:20,247
M4s.
Full auto.

366
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,890
Custom scopes.

367
00:25:22,767 --> 00:25:23,767
We know.

368
00:25:36,925 --> 00:25:39,411
David, call him.
Tell him to give him the cash.

369
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:44,529
Niners

370
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,842
God damn it, Laroy.

371
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,361
Shit.

372
00:26:30,412 --> 00:26:31,838
Shit. Thanks, man.

373
00:26:43,092 --> 00:26:44,214
Let's go!

374
00:26:59,387 --> 00:27:00,951
What the hell happened here? Gun!

375
00:27:05,995 --> 00:27:06,995
Clay!

376
00:27:07,362 --> 00:27:08,416
Lay some down!

377
00:27:16,132 --> 00:27:17,132
Get in!

378
00:27:32,297 --> 00:27:35,099
Was this a mistake
or was Laroy sending a message?

379
00:27:35,662 --> 00:27:38,154
I don't know.
This could be worst case scenario.

380
00:27:39,586 --> 00:27:41,741
Niners want us dead.
Mayans won't trust us.

381
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,221
We'll lose our customer base,

382
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,405
gain two huge beefs.

383
00:27:47,064 --> 00:27:48,464
Broke with no guns.

384
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,666
Shit.
It's Gemma.

385
00:27:56,671 --> 00:27:57,821
I'm on my way.

386
00:27:58,136 --> 00:27:59,771
- Can you pick up Wendy?
- Yeah.

387
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:01,564
I'll be there in a few.

388
00:28:01,966 --> 00:28:03,240
All right, baby.

389
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:12,894
I got to go pick up my kid.

390
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:15,370
Well, we need something good right now.
Go get him.

391
00:28:15,495 --> 00:28:17,845
All right.
I'll see you at the house.

392
00:28:25,385 --> 00:28:27,229
What the hell was that, man?

393
00:28:27,354 --> 00:28:30,764
Looks like the angry black man
was even angrier than we thought.

394
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:35,503
Laroy definitely double-crossed us.

395
00:28:36,887 --> 00:28:37,887
And Ope.

396
00:28:40,328 --> 00:28:43,495
No, I couldn't.
Couldn't get a clear shot.

397
00:28:45,774 --> 00:28:46,774
Well, if...

398
00:28:47,969 --> 00:28:50,477
if the Niners
are that pissed, maybe...

399
00:28:52,322 --> 00:28:54,837
Maybe they bring
their rage to Charming.

400
00:28:55,072 --> 00:28:57,983
They saw Opie's truck
at the money drop.

401
00:29:02,506 --> 00:29:03,856
What, a drive-by?

402
00:29:04,513 --> 00:29:06,881
Got to be tonight after the party.

403
00:29:08,755 --> 00:29:10,849
Make it ghetto.
Make it gangsta.

404
00:29:10,974 --> 00:29:11,989
All right.

405
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:24,010
I've been looking all over for you.

406
00:29:26,195 --> 00:29:27,722
What the hell you doing in here?

407
00:29:28,232 --> 00:29:31,234
Only place I can think
without the ATF buzzing around.

408
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:34,229
I can relate.

409
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:36,983
I got some information.

410
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:39,692
And if I give it to you,

411
00:29:40,141 --> 00:29:41,991
then I'm betraying my badge.

412
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,559
And if I don't...

413
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:50,451
... someone could get hurt.

414
00:29:58,712 --> 00:29:59,712
That badge

415
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,432
ain't even real silver.

416
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:07,007
What do you need to tell me, son?

417
00:30:12,274 --> 00:30:14,924
This might be your most
insidious move yet.

418
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,642
You have to be more specific.

419
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,162
Convincing Wendy
she might actually have

420
00:30:20,287 --> 00:30:22,671
a shot of winning
back Jax and her family?

421
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:26,197
That's a lot of false hope
to lay on a recovering addict.

422
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:29,257
I don't know where
you're going with this,

423
00:30:29,382 --> 00:30:30,915
but I was trying to help Wendy.

424
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,149
Encourage her efforts to change.

425
00:30:33,274 --> 00:30:35,748
Yes. You are the embodiment
of encouragement.

426
00:30:41,113 --> 00:30:42,286
Little man.

427
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,695
We're busting you out of this place.

428
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,261
It's okay.
Thanks, Doc.

429
00:30:51,785 --> 00:30:53,032
Appreciate it.

430
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,314
Let's get this family home.

431
00:31:09,436 --> 00:31:11,159
Kids, look at this.

432
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:16,366
Congratulations, Jax.

433
00:31:17,077 --> 00:31:18,980
- Look at that.
- He's beautiful, Jax.

434
00:31:19,105 --> 00:31:21,355
Getting ready for his first brewski?

435
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,320
Just you and Grandpa.

436
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:38,956
My boss is pulling
the plug on Charming.

437
00:31:41,385 --> 00:31:42,447
Why?

438
00:31:42,572 --> 00:31:45,782
The Mayan body count
in Oakland pissed off the FBI.

439
00:31:46,477 --> 00:31:48,316
Gonna have to settle for Munson.

440
00:31:48,441 --> 00:31:50,198
Squeeze him for the rest.

441
00:31:51,093 --> 00:31:52,343
What about Opie?

442
00:31:54,541 --> 00:31:55,828
Opie made his own bed.

443
00:31:56,739 --> 00:31:59,471
Yeah, and Clay thinks
you're in that bed with him.

444
00:31:59,596 --> 00:32:00,869
Okay, this guy's in danger.

445
00:32:00,994 --> 00:32:02,789
The witness's identity
will be out tomorrow.

446
00:32:02,914 --> 00:32:05,505
Sam Crow will know
that he is not the snitch.

447
00:32:05,922 --> 00:32:08,335
Look, a lot of shit
can happen overnight.

448
00:32:09,578 --> 00:32:11,719
You cannot pull your detail off him.

449
00:32:12,962 --> 00:32:14,463
It's out of my hands.

450
00:32:18,306 --> 00:32:19,936
You guys are unbelievable.

451
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:23,417
You storm in here,
and you turn this town upside down,

452
00:32:24,066 --> 00:32:26,400
and then you just walk away,

453
00:32:26,631 --> 00:32:30,063
and you leave us with this mess.

454
00:32:37,504 --> 00:32:39,162
We had some fun, though.

455
00:32:39,492 --> 00:32:40,492
Right?

456
00:32:51,443 --> 00:32:54,166
How you doing, man?
Yeah, you're good?

457
00:32:56,123 --> 00:32:58,804
Watch this.
You think he can keep this up?

458
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:05,982
Wendy, when these kids get older,
they lose their nerve.

459
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:10,795
- Watch my hands.
- I got to see how you drink this.

460
00:33:15,685 --> 00:33:17,005
You doing okay?

461
00:33:27,231 --> 00:33:29,401
We're gonna sell this on the road.

462
00:33:31,002 --> 00:33:32,594
I'll be right back.

463
00:33:33,227 --> 00:33:35,254
Can I talk to you for a second?

464
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:38,541
I need a drink.

465
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:47,656
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, it's just...

466
00:33:48,571 --> 00:33:51,119
Look, Wendy's like
a heartbeat sober.

467
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:53,238
We don't want to do
anything to set her off.

468
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:56,124
- Because she's still in love with you?
- No.

469
00:33:56,531 --> 00:33:58,594
Look, I'm just saying
we should be cool

470
00:33:58,719 --> 00:34:00,870
with whatever this is around her,
you know?

471
00:34:01,405 --> 00:34:03,081
Whatever this is?

472
00:34:03,464 --> 00:34:04,791
You know what I mean.

473
00:34:05,433 --> 00:34:06,613
No, I don't.

474
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:29,998
Do me a favor.
Make sure Tara gets home okay.

475
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:31,869
Don't ask.

476
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:33,638
Okay.

477
00:34:40,837 --> 00:34:43,329
- What happened?
- I got no idea.

478
00:34:45,976 --> 00:34:48,432
- Sorry.
- Yeah, I can see that.

479
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:51,882
We got to head out.

480
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,381
They've had a long day.

481
00:34:54,415 --> 00:34:55,729
Thanks for coming.

482
00:34:55,854 --> 00:34:57,510
- I'm glad Abel's home.
- Me, too.

483
00:34:58,523 --> 00:35:00,273
Come on, kids.
Let's go.

484
00:35:01,962 --> 00:35:03,075
Come on, guys.

485
00:35:15,198 --> 00:35:16,776
Okay, kids, seat belts.

486
00:35:17,062 --> 00:35:18,272
***

487
00:35:33,551 --> 00:35:35,256
I love you kids, bye.

488
00:35:36,098 --> 00:35:37,948
Hey, you coming right home?

489
00:35:38,091 --> 00:35:39,915
- Yeah, why?
- I want to come back

490
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,285
- and help Gemma clean up.
- Why don't you just stay?

491
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:44,280
I can take the kids home
and put them in bed.

492
00:35:44,405 --> 00:35:45,558
- You sure?
- Yeah.

493
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:50,681
- Thanks, baby.
- You welcome.

494
00:35:50,806 --> 00:35:54,201
You got some cash?
Gemma needs powder for the dishwasher.

495
00:35:57,105 --> 00:35:58,321
Love you.

496
00:35:58,491 --> 00:35:59,593
Love you back

497
00:36:00,676 --> 00:36:03,374
- Good night, babies.
- Good night, Mommy.

498
00:37:41,728 --> 00:37:43,047
What's going on?

499
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:46,524
Sorry to bother
you on this occasion,

500
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:49,682
but I got some information
that probably shouldn't wait.

501
00:37:50,022 --> 00:37:53,895
Hey, listen, if it's about
that Niner-Mayan shooting in Oakland...

502
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:56,147
No, it's about Opie.

503
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:57,961
What about him?

504
00:37:58,395 --> 00:38:01,183
I know ATF's been
hanging him out as a rat,

505
00:38:02,175 --> 00:38:05,146
but that ain't the case.
He's not working for them.

506
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:06,979
The wire's on him,

507
00:38:07,215 --> 00:38:09,027
but not to his knowledge.

508
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:12,084
The witness is somebody
that lived in the building

509
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:13,903
where Hefner got killed.

510
00:38:15,313 --> 00:38:17,001
That's who fingered Bobby Elvis.

511
00:38:20,558 --> 00:38:22,946
- How do you know this?
- Hale.

512
00:38:23,406 --> 00:38:26,276
He's been privy to all of it.

513
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,046
I just thought you should know that,

514
00:38:30,171 --> 00:38:33,309
in case you were having
doubts about loyalty and such.

515
00:38:34,836 --> 00:38:36,486
Yeah, I appreciate that.

516
00:38:37,152 --> 00:38:39,602
Tell Jax I'm glad
his boy's come home.

517
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,207
Come on.

518
00:39:08,073 --> 00:39:09,484
You all right, baby?

519
00:39:16,765 --> 00:39:17,833
What is it?

520
00:39:50,043 --> 00:39:50,845
Shit.

521
00:40:16,065 --> 00:40:16,871
Donna?

522
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:22,168
It's all right, sir, I let them in.

523
00:40:28,162 --> 00:40:29,402
Baby.

524
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,959
What do we know?

525
00:41:05,673 --> 00:41:09,381
Guy walking his dog saw
a black SUV roll up on the truck.

526
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:12,093
Shot her through the back window.

527
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,930
- Did they see the guy? Was he black?
- They couldn't say.

528
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:17,890
Jesus.

529
00:41:19,497 --> 00:41:22,895
Unless Donna's been living
some kind of double life,

530
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:26,981
I'm thinking this brutality
was meant for Opie.

531
00:41:31,692 --> 00:41:34,735
Some scumbag made a tragic mistake.

532
00:41:35,539 --> 00:41:38,113
Yeah, I guess that's
a pretty fair guess.

533
00:41:47,878 --> 00:41:48,878
Come on.

534
00:41:49,068 --> 00:41:51,732
Come on, this isn't
the way to remember her.

535
00:42:20,956 --> 00:42:24,497
I told you this shit would go bad.
This blood's on you.

536
00:42:24,622 --> 00:42:26,102
Back off, Hale.

537
00:42:37,681 --> 00:42:38,676
I'm sorry.

538
00:42:58,035 --> 00:42:59,864
I'm so sorry, baby.

539
00:43:08,605 --> 00:43:10,461
How's Opie doing?

540
00:43:12,993 --> 00:43:14,643
You should go home, Mom.

541
00:43:17,288 --> 00:43:18,886
What about the baby?

542
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:22,736
I can take care of my son.

543
00:43:25,625 --> 00:43:26,687
You sure?

544
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,987
It's time for me to do this, Mom.

545
00:43:35,057 --> 00:43:36,151
Okay, baby.

546
00:46:27,286 --> 00:46:29,356
