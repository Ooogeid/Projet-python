00:00:00,245 --> 00:00:01,564
<i>Previously on</i> The Kill Point...

2
00:00:01,686 --> 00:00:04,093
This is a bank robbery.
Follow these simple instructions

3
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:06,336
and we can all walk out of here
safe and sound.

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,470
Fall back!

5
00:00:07,611 --> 00:00:09,692
This is now a hostage situation.
Who is this?

6
00:00:10,003 --> 00:00:12,810
- Captain Horst Cali.
- I'm Wolf. Mr. Wolf.

7
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:16,313
- That girl was an acceptable casualty.
- Know your place, corporal.

8
00:00:16,553 --> 00:00:19,402
We'd like to get in touch with
someone from sergeant Mendez's platoon.

9
00:00:19,515 --> 00:00:22,059
That's a good godamn man in that bank.
They're all good men.

10
00:00:22,181 --> 00:00:24,905
Sent Leon in with a scrambler.
Gonna get you home, sergeant.

11
00:00:25,145 --> 00:00:26,379
- Bring Leon back in.
- Gone.

12
00:00:26,563 --> 00:00:27,908
Tonray, put an A.P.B. on Leon.

13
00:00:28,136 --> 00:00:30,608
If Wolf has anybody out there,
I'll find him and detain him.

14
00:00:30,706 --> 00:00:32,016
We gotta get outta here.

15
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:35,731
- No, I'm scared.
- I'll protect you. I promise.

16
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,335
Our boy've wait
a lot time to talk to you.

17
00:00:38,575 --> 00:00:40,671
- Can't you see they're using you?
- I'm using them.

18
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:43,882
The bug on the photograph needs to be
within 3 feet for us to hear them.

19
00:00:44,122 --> 00:00:46,426
It's the creepy me's mission
to find the original,

20
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,387
take over,
and do as much evil as it can.

21
00:00:48,627 --> 00:00:50,236
- That's it, it's over.
- Don't move.

22
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:52,535
Take her gun, man.
Take it!

23
00:00:57,065 --> 00:00:58,313
<i>After several days here</i>

24
00:00:58,553 --> 00:01:01,134
<i>at Three Rivers Trust,
iraqi war veteran Jake Mendez</i>

25
00:01:01,256 --> 00:01:03,959

26

<i>Stay tuned to News 14.</i>

31
00:01:18,598 --> 00:01:20,529
Cap, something's coming through.

32
00:01:20,745 --> 00:01:24,047
Uh, I don't know what he's saying.
It sounds like gibberish.

33
00:01:35,843 --> 00:01:36,643
Arabic.

34
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:43,291
What the hell is going on in there?

35
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:51,298
It's not me walking hollow.

36
00:01:51,515 --> 00:01:52,471
It's not...

37
00:01:58,212 --> 00:02:01,433
It's not me.
No, it's not me, you can't see me.

38
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:03,270
Mike?

39
00:02:03,826 --> 00:02:05,214
Don't call me.
I can't listen.

40
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:06,965
I can't listen.

41
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:13,253
An empty shell.
Finding hell, finding me.

42
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:17,017
The creepies crawl and find us all.

43
00:02:19,217 --> 00:02:20,729
FIND ME,
FINDS US ALL! (del vo)

44
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:23,962
Come on.
Hey, Mike...

45
00:02:25,017 --> 00:02:26,835
It'll be all right, brother.

46
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,820
Just hold on a little while longer.

47
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,847
Let me take a look at this.

48
00:02:56,227 --> 00:02:57,451
<i>The devil, its...</i>

49
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:59,637
<i>It's finding me.</i>

50
00:03:00,592 --> 00:03:02,562
<i>The creepies crawl and find us all.</i>

51
00:03:03,595 --> 00:03:05,081
<i>It's the creepy me's.</i>

52
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:08,227
I don't know
what this "creepy me" shit is,

53
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:10,445
but clearly someone in there
done lost their nut.

54
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:13,069
It's gotta mean something to somebody.

55
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,661
Just get as many people
down here as possible.

56
00:03:17,901 --> 00:03:18,912
You want a big protest?

57
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:21,290
The bigger the crowd,
the better it's gonna be.

58
00:03:21,475 --> 00:03:23,645
- <i>Can you do it?</i>
- Don't worry, I'm gonna do my thing.

59
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:26,490
That's right, just let me know
when you're ready to roll. Call me.

60
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:27,936
Sarge, mike is real bad.

61
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:31,216
I can't keep the gangrene localized.
It's necrotizing,

62
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,592
spreading through his body.

63
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:36,167
He's damn close to septic shock,
if it hasn't already set in.

64
00:03:36,327 --> 00:03:38,023
You think he can move on his own?

65
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,641
Yeah, probably.
Why?

66
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:42,728
'Cause extraction plan's in place.
We got exactly 2 hours

67
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:44,457
to get the hell outta here.

Episode 1x06
Transcript: swsub.com / Sync: DarKsh

69
00:04:12,888 --> 00:04:14,426
Hey, hey,
ho, ho,

70
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,580
let our brothers go.

71
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:44,790
Right on time, fellas.

72
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:47,834
Status, Stan.

73
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:51,004
Yeah, we're close.
Real close.

74
00:04:51,316 --> 00:04:53,006
Keep moving, buddy.
Keep moving.

75
00:05:01,448 --> 00:05:03,953
Remember when you told me to track
on Wolf's platoon mates?

76
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:06,103
- Yes, Tonray, you remember to do it?
- Yes.

77
00:05:06,477 --> 00:05:08,438
Something just came over
the security desk

78
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:10,565
at Pittsburgh International.
Check it out.

79
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,821
Two of Wolf's platoon mates flew in
a couple days ago. Positive I.D.

80
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:18,198
on Stanley Grimes and Charles Derzius.

81
00:05:18,438 --> 00:05:20,234
- These men flew in two days ago?
- Yes.

82
00:05:20,312 --> 00:05:22,345
- And I'm just finding out now?
- A lot of people

83
00:05:22,484 --> 00:05:24,646
pass through the airport, Cap.
I'm surprised I fou...

84
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:28,333
Yeah, Tonray, but only 2 people from the
1013 platoon pass through the airport.

85
00:05:28,592 --> 00:05:30,043
Where are Derzius and Grimes now?

86
00:05:30,283 --> 00:05:34,033
They haven't checked into any hotels.
I'm keeping tabs on their bank accounts.

87
00:05:34,621 --> 00:05:37,134
Forget about your tabs.
Use your instinct, can you do that?

88
00:05:37,374 --> 00:05:39,160
- My instinct?
- Yes, your instinct.

89
00:05:39,282 --> 00:05:40,595
Use the brain in your head.

90
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:42,925
And tell me
why you think they are in town.

91
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,343
- Now?
- Spit it out.

92
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:47,894
He's obviously re-assembling his platoon

93
00:05:48,134 --> 00:05:50,772
here in Pittsburgh.
Putting together a team

94
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:54,192
to help assist him in some shape
or form or capacity.

95
00:05:55,177 --> 00:05:56,611
If that was indeed the case,

96
00:05:56,851 --> 00:05:59,865
it'ld help explain the presence of
one-armed Leon, the political elements,

97
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:02,909
and of course the impractical demands
that Wolf is making.

98
00:06:03,393 --> 00:06:05,579
That's my general gut feeling, Captain.

99
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,415
Well, okay then.

100
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:25,184
I'm gonna get us outta here, man.

101
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:28,727
Little brother, we're gonna
start over again, just you and me.

102
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:31,353
Do you hear me, Mike?
Come on, man.

103
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,360
Done three tours and it feels like home.

104
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:44,409
I just found out that I'm going home.

105
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:47,787
Gettin' my brothers and I'm going home.

106
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,895
Back to the States where I got no home.

107
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,186
It smells like ass in here.

108
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:12,859
Yeah, well, I guarantee you
I'm contributing heavily to that.

109
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:14,197
It's disgusting.

110
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:16,066
And it's rude.

111
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:19,152
Oh, I'm sorry law man.

112
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:22,113
I forgot your education
and white collar gig

113
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:26,576
prevents your pits and prizes
from carrying the same level of stink.

114
00:07:27,753 --> 00:07:29,329
Oh, God, I can't take this.

115
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:31,790
- I'm getting cabin fever.
- You had your chance

116
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,277
and you blew it!

117
00:07:33,676 --> 00:07:37,212
We'd be home soaking our shit up nice
in the tub if you pulled your weight.

118
00:07:38,534 --> 00:07:39,534
And the trigger.

119
00:07:39,656 --> 00:07:41,389
I'm sorry I couldn't do it.

120
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,027
I couldn't kill him.

121
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:45,038
- What do you want me to say?
- Nothing!

122
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:46,922
I don't want nothing from you.

123
00:07:47,284 --> 00:07:48,557
Daddy's not here to help,

124
00:07:48,797 --> 00:07:52,102
- so how can you ever help yourself?
- That's enough. Leave her alone.

125
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:57,702
Could you have done it, tough guy?

126
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:02,477
Shot Mr. Pig in the head,
point blank just like that?

127
00:08:03,102 --> 00:08:07,206
I would've lined them up
and executed them one by one

128
00:08:07,676 --> 00:08:09,160
without hesitation.

129
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:12,603
Then why didn't you?

130
00:08:17,657 --> 00:08:19,754
Let us out, please!

131
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,375
We can't breathe...

132
00:08:25,654 --> 00:08:27,512
And we need to use the bathroom!

133
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,084
Please.

134
00:08:33,052 --> 00:08:34,160
Albert.

135
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:36,271
Please.

136
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,232
I...
I screwed up again, bro.

137
00:09:06,897 --> 00:09:08,617
La, la... brother.

138
00:09:09,574 --> 00:09:11,096
Put on your poker face.

139
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,267
Don't let anyone see she got to you.

140
00:09:15,675 --> 00:09:17,196
We're trash, bro.

141
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:19,033
Okay?

142
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:20,870
Low life grunts.

143
00:09:21,597 --> 00:09:24,148
We've no place in her world.
We never will.

144
00:09:25,602 --> 00:09:29,991
She's not programmed to care about us,
people like you, underprivileged.

145
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:32,031
So learn your lesson.

146
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:34,746
Know your place

147
00:09:34,986 --> 00:09:36,375
on the bottom.

148
00:09:37,002 --> 00:09:40,475
But let's be the best we can be
in our basement, right?

149
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:47,834
Saddle up, soldier.

150
00:09:48,284 --> 00:09:50,294
Extraction plan almost underway.

151
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:07,737
Hey, guys, guys,
Big Stan and Derz're in the train tunnel

152
00:10:07,977 --> 00:10:10,304
below us
trying to dig through the floor.

153
00:10:10,468 --> 00:10:13,278
They can't come directly through
this floor, it's reinforced steel.

154
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,223
That's right, the best they can
is come through next door.

155
00:10:16,343 --> 00:10:18,612
We got a couple of swaties,
but I'm gonna distract them.

156
00:10:18,738 --> 00:10:20,500
- Distract them how?
- I got it covered.

157
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,627
We're getting outta here.
Just prep for exit.

158
00:10:22,992 --> 00:10:24,838
I get Abe to shut off the wall sensors.

159
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:26,906
- Yeah, get all of it.
- No, let me do that.

160
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,088
I got some unfinished business
with him anyway.

161
00:10:46,677 --> 00:10:48,466
Hey, hey,
Ho, ho,

162
00:10:48,683 --> 00:10:50,313
let our brothers go.

163
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,660
Damn.

164
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,966
The mind, Johnny-boy.

165
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:24,439
The mind banks all memories,
good and bad.

166
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:27,243
Locks 'em in our vault, you know?

167
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:31,404
Just can't shake unsightly shit.

168
00:11:36,784 --> 00:11:37,786
<i>I got a one-armed guy</i>

169
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:40,455
- <i>inside the perimeter.</i>
- Description?

170
00:11:40,844 --> 00:11:43,792
<i>Mid-forties, six feet tall,
missing his right arm elbow down.</i>

171
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:46,666
Not him.
Our guy's missing his left.

172
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,631
You think he's got another one-armed guy
coming off a train?

173
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:51,966
Same question, which arm?

174
00:11:53,157 --> 00:11:54,157
Which arm?

175
00:11:56,034 --> 00:11:58,389
Not Leon.
This guy was missing both arms.

176
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:01,035
A man missing both arms
is not a one-armed man.

177
00:12:01,157 --> 00:12:03,353
Put out an A.P.B. on Derzius and Grimes.

178
00:12:03,593 --> 00:12:05,146
Crowd is out of control.

179
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:07,823
The more these vets show up,
the worse it gets. You seeing?

180
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,234
- Yes.
- Godamn zoo!

181
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:13,238
Let's hope the protest
is the only reason they're here.

182
00:12:13,573 --> 00:12:15,031
This explains the amputees, cap.

183
00:12:16,147 --> 00:12:17,951
Think it's why
Derzius and Grimes're here?

184
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:19,533
No.

185
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:22,775
Maybe Wolf's political agenda
isn't bullshit. If that's the case,

186
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:24,065
we're back to zero.

187
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:28,545
Let's worry about what this means
after we get this contained, okay?

188
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:45,338
<i>Everything's in place, sarge.</i>

189
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,664
<i>I made some calls.
We got a lot of brothers out there.</i>

190
00:12:47,784 --> 00:12:49,096
Great.
I'm ready.

191
00:12:49,221 --> 00:12:51,262
Make sure those swaties
keep their eyes on you.

192
00:12:51,382 --> 00:12:52,898
We need five minutes.

193
00:13:01,486 --> 00:13:02,804
<i>Captain, I'm coming outside.</i>

194
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:04,956
- You're ready to talk to me again?
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

195
00:13:05,282 --> 00:13:06,996
But not just to you, buddy.

196
00:13:24,966 --> 00:13:25,977
Hold your fire!

197
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:30,237
What're you doing Wolf?

198
00:13:30,378 --> 00:13:31,876
- You're married Cap?
- What?

199
00:13:32,036 --> 00:13:34,281
- You've got kids?
- What are you talking about?

200
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,303
There're certain rules of engagement
regarding families of combatants.

201
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:38,945
And you broke every single one of 'em.

202
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:40,538
Listen to me,
I brought your son

203
00:13:40,684 --> 00:13:42,975
so you might know
you still have something to live for.

204
00:13:43,093 --> 00:13:45,633
Yeah, where are my demands?
Flak jacket for every soldier?

205
00:13:45,712 --> 00:13:48,249
The child of every senator enlisting?
Where are those demands?

206
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,501
- Tell them where they're at.
- Why don't you tell me

207
00:13:50,741 --> 00:13:52,204
what you really want, huh?
Tell me.

208
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:54,842
You might have some of them
believing this political bullshit,

209
00:13:54,954 --> 00:13:56,215
but I'm not one of them.

210
00:13:56,622 --> 00:13:59,907
I'm glad to see all of you here, man.
I'm glad you made it down.

211
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:02,005
- Times running out.
- I thought the whole world

212
00:14:02,161 --> 00:14:03,549
was against us for a minute.

213
00:14:03,838 --> 00:14:06,768
- Not all of us are with you, sergeant.
- It's okay, pops. Don't worry.

214
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:08,174
It's your right, man.

215
00:14:08,426 --> 00:14:11,147
It's a free country last time I checked.
That's all I'm doing here.

216
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,400
I'm exercising my freedom of speech.

217
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,424
That's right. And I'm glad to see
my brothers from Baghdad.

218
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:21,394
Good to see you made it down, man.
My sisters from Fallujah.

219
00:14:21,675 --> 00:14:23,029
Good to see, y'all.

220
00:14:24,111 --> 00:14:25,245
Khe sanh.

221
00:14:25,485 --> 00:14:27,492
The brig.
Hey, good to see you, man.

222
00:14:27,612 --> 00:14:30,008
I'm glad you made it.
I'm glad you made it down.

223
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:33,033
Everybody's here.
I'm so proud to see you here, man.

224
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:35,945
'Cause the longer they make us wait,
the stronger we're gonna get.

225
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:38,694
Right?
'Cause my platoon, we did two tours.

226
00:14:39,084 --> 00:14:41,049
<i>That's 15 months of hell.</i>

227
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:43,518
Let's go.
We're moving you.

228
00:14:44,674 --> 00:14:46,173
Where? Where am I going?
Wait...

229
00:14:46,297 --> 00:14:47,554
Shut up.
Move along.

230
00:14:47,674 --> 00:14:49,453
Look, I really...
I just wanna speak to...

231
00:14:49,576 --> 00:14:52,410
Marshal?
Marshall, we gotta lock him up, man.

232
00:14:52,513 --> 00:14:55,039
Just give him one more minute.
Go ahead, what?

233
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,922
Of course it's possible
to do a wire transfer.

234
00:14:58,048 --> 00:15:01,703
But they'll see what bank the money
came from, and they'll flag the account.

235
00:15:02,147 --> 00:15:02,949
Abe.

236
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:06,213
You can do something here.
Come on, man, don't shit me.

237
00:15:07,568 --> 00:15:09,381
Well, I mean, what we could...

238
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:12,574
What we could do is we could transfer
the money from multiple accounts.

239
00:15:12,696 --> 00:15:14,837
Like, you know,
commercial and personal accounts.

240
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,016
Then you route the money
through different branches

241
00:15:17,127 --> 00:15:19,383
and create, like, a smokescreen,

242
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:21,064
a labyrinth, if you will.

243
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:24,046
If you will.
Go ahead, yeah. Hell yeah, do that.

244
00:15:24,377 --> 00:15:25,829
Okay.
All right.

245
00:15:28,714 --> 00:15:30,320
We were supposed to go home

246
00:15:30,535 --> 00:15:33,134
on december '05.
And then they called us up

247
00:15:33,469 --> 00:15:37,241
and they said, "we need you boys."
So they redeployed our asses to Mosul.

248
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:41,654
Whole lot of killing in Mosul, man.
And then they called me a coward,

249
00:15:41,894 --> 00:15:44,435
and they threw me in jail.
You know why they threw me in jail?

250
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:47,480
'Cause I wouldn't let my men
die for their war. That's why.

251
00:15:47,857 --> 00:15:50,467
<i>'Cause they'd rather have
dead soldiers than live vets</i>

252
00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:52,724
<i>'cause it's a lot less embarrassing</i>

253
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:55,126
<i>and a lot cheaper! That's why!
So get me W!</i>

254
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,127
All right, they're in position.
Go. Go. Go.

255
00:15:58,953 --> 00:16:01,461
<i>Get me anybody.
Somebody who'll get shit done</i>

256
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:03,843
<i>and get me what I want.</i>

257
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:10,558
Die for your war.
Tell me what for.

258
00:16:10,914 --> 00:16:13,233
Die for their war.
Tell me what for.

259
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:45,364
Why are you watching this?

260
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:48,256
Because that's what he wants.
All eyes on him.

261
00:16:48,622 --> 00:16:50,890
- Wants to be a celebrity then.
- He certainly wants

262
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,556
everyone's attention.

263
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:54,352
Question is why.

264
00:16:54,592 --> 00:16:57,105
- We gotta figure that out.
- That's what I'm trying to do.

265
00:17:00,097 --> 00:17:01,984
<i>I want you all to show America</i>

266
00:17:02,224 --> 00:17:05,024
what you gave for your country,
'cause I already showed them mine.

267
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,662
It's your turn.
Show America what you gave, man.

268
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,541
Come on, show 'em. Show America
what you gave for your country, man.

269
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:13,649
That's right.
Come on, show them.

270
00:17:13,803 --> 00:17:16,767
Come on, it's your turn.
Come on, show America.

271
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,120
It's your turn, man.
Show 'em. Show 'em.

272
00:17:20,043 --> 00:17:21,094
That's it.

273
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:23,543
That's right.
Baby, show it all.

274
00:17:23,657 --> 00:17:24,869
Show America.

275
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:26,259
That's right.

276
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:30,681
Show America, man.
Show America.

277
00:18:14,684 --> 00:18:15,783
Give me that.

278
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:16,527
Gotta go, gotta go.
Come on, fellas.

279
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,935
Marshall, gotta go, gotta go.
Come on.

280
00:19:21,101 --> 00:19:22,255
This the final conformation?

281
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,262
Yeah, the transfer's gone through.

282
00:19:24,976 --> 00:19:25,984
What's he talking about?

283
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:28,797
It may have taken us a couple of days
instead of five minutes,

284
00:19:28,923 --> 00:19:30,722
but we finally robbed a bank, boys.

285
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:32,992
- You're shittin' me.
- Nah, man.

286
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,137
It's clean and legit too.

287
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:37,273
How much we lookin' at?

288
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,628
A little bit over six mil.

289
00:19:40,371 --> 00:19:42,086
- $6 million?
- Yeah, man.

290
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,355
Hey, Abe, man,
you were a little bit nervous,

291
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:46,833
- but a wiz with those numbers.
- Oh yeah?

292
00:19:46,965 --> 00:19:49,224
- Where's the pickup?
- Canada. Great Falls bank.

293
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:51,175
I figure
that we just slide under the border.

294
00:19:51,288 --> 00:19:53,785
You know, drink, ski,
screw till we, you know, tired of it.

295
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:55,725
No, no, I don't do Canada, man.

296
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,639
I'm going home.
Just wire me my money.

297
00:19:58,476 --> 00:20:00,853
What home is that, Albert?
Got a home?

298
00:20:01,505 --> 00:20:04,232
You're a marked man. You're running
for the rest of your life, man.

299
00:20:08,142 --> 00:20:09,844
Think about that, brother.

300
00:20:10,602 --> 00:20:13,153
'Cause I didn't think about that
till just about now.

301
00:20:13,756 --> 00:20:15,185
Who's gonna take care of ma?

302
00:20:15,932 --> 00:20:17,402
What are we gonna do with her?

303
00:20:17,853 --> 00:20:19,580
We don't have to do anything with her.

304
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,357
She's gonna be fine.

305
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:25,149
Me and you, man. We start
a new life together, that's that.

306
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:29,289
Me and you.

307
00:20:35,061 --> 00:20:36,710
You do something to that transfer, Abe?

308
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,586
What are you talking about?

309
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,268
- What I'm talking about?
- Calm down,

310
00:20:40,347 --> 00:20:42,438
I was over his shoulder the whole time.
It's cool.

311
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:46,771
Only one of us are gonna go
in that bank in Canada, Abe.

312
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,889
Just in case you did something stupid.

313
00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:50,620
In case you set us up.

314
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:52,120
And if you did,

315
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:54,399
I come back here,
I find you in your sleep,

316
00:20:54,535 --> 00:20:55,635
and I peel your skin.

317
00:20:59,742 --> 00:21:00,973
That money's insured.

318
00:21:03,414 --> 00:21:06,126
If something happens,
it's because you did something stupid.

319
00:21:06,252 --> 00:21:07,268
Not me.

320
00:21:07,612 --> 00:21:09,664
Come on, we gotta go.
Do you hear me?

321
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,540
We gotta go.
Come on, fellas.

322
00:21:11,677 --> 00:21:12,732
Running outta time.

323
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:49,840
If you're gonna kill us,
you gotta let us know.

324
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:51,408
It's the honorable thing to do.

325
00:21:54,184 --> 00:21:55,748
Come on, everybody, get your things.

326
00:21:58,037 --> 00:21:59,887
It's almost over.
You're gonna go home soon.

327
00:22:15,693 --> 00:22:17,061
How are you getting out of here?

328
00:22:17,665 --> 00:22:19,161
Hey, don't worry.
Don't worry.

329
00:22:19,354 --> 00:22:20,354
Just watch the news.

330
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,570
Take me with you.

331
00:22:51,382 --> 00:22:52,387
Take me.

332
00:22:52,524 --> 00:22:54,445
- You might need a hostage.
- No, I can't.

333
00:22:54,569 --> 00:22:55,569
How could I do that?

334
00:22:56,507 --> 00:22:59,425
You can run away all you want,
but you don't want any part of my life.

335
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:01,264
Trust me,
you don't want to be part of that.

336
00:23:01,362 --> 00:23:03,056
Please just listen to me...

337
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,109
Just listen to me for a second.
I know how crazy this is.

338
00:23:09,883 --> 00:23:11,201
I have a connection with you.

339
00:23:18,195 --> 00:23:20,071
Please don't send me back to my life.

340
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:24,786
Please, this is...
This is...

341
00:23:26,383 --> 00:23:27,383
This is what I want.

342
00:23:27,713 --> 00:23:31,055
I know, I know, but not like this.

343
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:33,945
Not like this.

344
00:23:34,694 --> 00:23:37,383
And not with me. You're gonna
find your way, I'm telling you.

345
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:38,631
You'll find that way.

346
00:23:51,195 --> 00:23:52,195
Come on, I'm sorry.

347
00:24:40,257 --> 00:24:42,090
Hang in, Mikey,
we're getting out of here.

348
00:24:42,256 --> 00:24:43,574
I'm taking the A.K., brother.

349
00:25:11,172 --> 00:25:12,188
Good to see you boys.

350
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:15,259
Big Stan!

351
00:25:17,195 --> 00:25:18,195
Good to see you, man.

352
00:25:19,744 --> 00:25:20,936
What's up, brother man?

353
00:25:28,481 --> 00:25:29,946
Derz, what's going on, man?

354
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:49,256
Connie, this is Hawke.

355
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,570
I just spotted Leon.

356
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,866
- Are you sure?
- <i>Definitely.</i>

357
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,502
All right, stay back.
Make sure he doesn't see you.

358
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,507
- Monitor everything he does.
- <i>Roger.</i>

359
00:25:58,233 --> 00:25:59,249
What's up, Connie?

360
00:25:59,366 --> 00:26:00,576
It's Leon, cap, we found him.

361
00:26:02,069 --> 00:26:03,868
All right,
is he here for the protest rally?

362
00:26:03,927 --> 00:26:05,806
Or is he someone
we should be concerned about?

363
00:26:05,885 --> 00:26:06,945
That's it.

364
00:26:07,118 --> 00:26:09,307
Hawke spotted him two blocks away.

365
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:10,945
Key me into Hawke.

366
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:15,120
Hawke, talk to me.
What do we got?

367
00:26:15,755 --> 00:26:16,850
Male, mid-30s,

368
00:26:17,045 --> 00:26:19,479
one arm, got a cs40 ear bud,

369
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:21,941
keyed the mike a couple times.

370
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:23,331
<i>He's talking to somebody.</i>

371
00:26:23,568 --> 00:26:25,249
These 1013 guys are like cockroaches.

372
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:26,575
All right, what do you think?

373
00:26:27,181 --> 00:26:30,630
Nowhere near the protest,
talking to somebody, using an ear bud,

374
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,343
we need to find out
who's on the other end of that line.

375
00:26:33,506 --> 00:26:35,317
Maybe some of these guys
were called by Wolf

376
00:26:35,513 --> 00:26:37,324
for reasons
that weren't just political.

377
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,545
If we question him,
he's not gonna give us much, is he?

378
00:26:40,818 --> 00:26:41,818
Hardcore military.

379
00:26:42,445 --> 00:26:43,581
Doubt he'll say anything.

380
00:26:43,756 --> 00:26:45,574
Whatever we get from him,
we gotta take.

381
00:26:45,945 --> 00:26:47,937
Then we're just gonna have
to take it, aren't we?

382
00:26:52,007 --> 00:26:53,234
Leon keeps keying his mike.

383
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:56,383
He's talking to somebody.
He keeps looking around. Something's up.

384
00:26:56,674 --> 00:26:57,710
Bag him.

385
00:26:57,818 --> 00:27:00,174
It's time to move, Hawke.
Find out who he's talking to.

386
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:02,504
<i>But make sure he doesn't alert
whoever's on the line.</i>

387
00:27:02,613 --> 00:27:03,777
Do not let him key his mike.

388
00:27:38,495 --> 00:27:40,879
<i>Connie,
the photobug just went to static.</i>

389
00:27:41,043 --> 00:27:43,759
<i>I heard some movement, rustling,
and then whoosh... Gone.</i>

390
00:27:43,944 --> 00:27:46,171
In English, Tonray,
what the hell does that mean?

391
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:48,341
It was either crushed or flushed

392
00:27:48,556 --> 00:27:49,924
or moved somewhere out of range.

393
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:52,010
Tell Hawke he has to move quickly.

394
00:27:52,193 --> 00:27:53,193
Go, Hawke!

395
00:28:01,031 --> 00:28:02,066
Nice and still.

396
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:14,725
They're in a tunnel.

397
00:28:18,277 --> 00:28:20,518
Steel Plaza,
the hts are in Steel Plaza tunnel.

398
00:28:20,695 --> 00:28:22,490
- Come on!
- Hawke, hold. Team's on the way.

399
00:28:22,627 --> 00:28:23,700
That's why we lost the bug.

400
00:28:23,758 --> 00:28:25,632
You get extra people down there.
Now go, move.

401
00:28:25,682 --> 00:28:28,860
Bravo, move your post immediately,
meet Hawke at the gateway train, go!

402
00:28:28,943 --> 00:28:30,682
- What about the bank?
- We can't risk it.

403
00:28:30,739 --> 00:28:32,635
We don't know
if everybody's left the building.

404
00:28:32,733 --> 00:28:33,915
We go in when they come out.

405
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:16,622
All right, guys, we're clear.

406
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:17,953
Sarge, we gonna breathe.

407
00:29:18,054 --> 00:29:19,256
We're home free, boys!

408
00:29:23,348 --> 00:29:24,931
Put your weapons down now!

409
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,557
It's an ambush!

410
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:09,350
Move! Move back!

411
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,849
All the way back,
they are everywhere!

412
00:31:12,144 --> 00:31:13,199
Move and fire!

413
00:31:25,203 --> 00:31:26,356
Move and fire, man!

414
00:31:26,602 --> 00:31:27,981
I got no shots left!

415
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:34,302
Fall back, fall back!

416
00:31:40,806 --> 00:31:41,791
Move and fire!

417
00:31:43,074 --> 00:31:44,735
Bring him here, bring him here!

418
00:31:45,184 --> 00:31:47,666
Come on, move!
Damn it Henry, what's going on?

419
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,406
Come and get your brother, man!

420
00:31:54,103 --> 00:31:55,103
Go, go, go!

421
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:57,165
Move!

422
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:57,790
Move!

423
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:58,791
Go, go, go!

424
00:32:04,415 --> 00:32:05,822
Just hold on, relax.

425
00:32:06,115 --> 00:32:07,424
Everything's gonna be fine.

426
00:32:07,581 --> 00:32:09,027
Hold on, buddy, just hold on.

427
00:32:20,686 --> 00:32:21,800
Get in!

428
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:57,213
What happened?

429
00:32:57,416 --> 00:32:58,765
- What'd you do?
- I don't know!

430
00:32:59,468 --> 00:33:00,919
Move!
Get out of the way.

431
00:33:08,908 --> 00:33:10,686
I can't believe Stan is dead.

432
00:33:13,977 --> 00:33:15,011
He died for his platoon.

433
00:33:15,186 --> 00:33:16,903
That's what we do, man,
that's what we do.

434
00:33:17,108 --> 00:33:19,355
So close to walking out of here,
man, so close.

435
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,157
I know, Sarge, I was there, you know?

436
00:33:23,496 --> 00:33:24,512
You were there?

437
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:27,182
What was the excuse this time, man?

438
00:33:28,026 --> 00:33:29,649
What was it?
Yeah, lack of ammo, right?

439
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,973
Is that the story this time?

440
00:33:31,165 --> 00:33:32,165
Like in Fallujah?

441
00:33:38,195 --> 00:33:39,251
I thought I was out, man.

442
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:41,789
No walking out, no.

443
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:43,729
Not supposed to walk out.

444
00:33:43,867 --> 00:33:45,138
Don't say that, don't say that.

445
00:33:46,004 --> 00:33:47,137
No restart.

446
00:33:47,915 --> 00:33:48,915
You can't be reborn.

447
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:53,289
Especially not us.

448
00:33:53,855 --> 00:33:54,855
We're already dead.

449
00:33:56,914 --> 00:33:57,914
Thank you, Henry.

450
00:33:59,478 --> 00:34:01,541
Thank you, we all thank you.
We all thank you.

451
00:34:09,133 --> 00:34:10,149
What?

452
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:12,224
What?!

453
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,681
Ready to start talking, soldier?

454
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,727
Come on.

455
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,807
How many of you 1013 boys
were involved in this thing?

456
00:34:28,355 --> 00:34:29,945
Pretty well planned out, huh, Leon?

457
00:34:30,415 --> 00:34:32,051
Seems you were in it from the start.

458
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:35,470
How else could they
have coordinated an escape like that?

459
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:38,562
Keep smiling, asshole.

460
00:34:39,229 --> 00:34:40,229
People have been shot.

461
00:34:40,354 --> 00:34:41,499
Innocent bystanders.

462
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:42,934
Cops.

463
00:34:43,354 --> 00:34:44,758
You're involved in all of that now.

464
00:34:44,914 --> 00:34:45,914
You're an accessory.

465
00:34:46,257 --> 00:34:48,895
How do you think you're gonna
fare in prison with that one arm?

466
00:34:52,367 --> 00:34:53,950
We can take it over from here, chief.

467
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,682
That's it, that's it,
going home, people.

468
00:35:07,907 --> 00:35:09,705
I never been so excited
to see the police.

469
00:35:09,864 --> 00:35:11,251
There's always a first.

470
00:35:52,894 --> 00:35:54,008
Are you done?

471
00:35:59,352 --> 00:36:00,352
Keep your hands up.

472
00:36:02,363 --> 00:36:03,664
Do you have any water?

473
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:14,821
It's time for you
to start talking, soldier.

474
00:36:15,602 --> 00:36:17,196
1013, pro patria.

475
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:19,408
Don't you pull that shit with me.

476
00:36:20,069 --> 00:36:21,418
All kinds of vets are coming home

477
00:36:21,594 --> 00:36:23,509
scarred up, messed up, and pissed off!

478
00:36:23,695 --> 00:36:25,220
They got the strength to deal with it,

479
00:36:25,337 --> 00:36:27,560
because that is what we signed up for!

480
00:36:28,915 --> 00:36:31,518
The 1013, for our country.

481
00:36:31,917 --> 00:36:33,316
Damn pussy bastard.

482
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,230
Pretty cool.

483
00:36:41,352 --> 00:36:42,352
1013.

484
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:46,416
Problem is, there ain't much left
of the 1013, brother.

485
00:36:47,353 --> 00:36:50,792
In fact, you just lost
two more brothers in the tunnel.

486
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:54,597
Yeah, the 1013 is a dying breed.

487
00:36:55,415 --> 00:36:57,096
Your Sarge is running out of options.

488
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,790
I'll tell you what.

489
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,460
You help me,

490
00:37:01,134 --> 00:37:02,189
I help you.

491
00:37:02,602 --> 00:37:03,602
We help them.

492
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,039
Talk to me.

493
00:37:07,566 --> 00:37:08,640
No?

494
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,786
I got plenty of time to wait.

495
00:37:22,259 --> 00:37:25,766
So, am I correct in understanding
that, the two of you

496
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,934
spent that whole time in the closet?

497
00:37:28,689 --> 00:37:31,730
We locked ourselves in,
then we heard all that noise.

498
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:34,065
We panicked
and we went out through the vent.

499
00:37:34,221 --> 00:37:35,257
It was awful.

500
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:40,269
It was beautiful at times,
but it was mostly awful.

501
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:44,002
Yeah, it was mostly beautiful.

502
00:37:45,941 --> 00:37:48,130
And why were you
in the closet in the first place?

503
00:37:48,456 --> 00:37:49,883
Hey, look at this.

504
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:51,437
It's not good.

505
00:37:52,245 --> 00:37:53,925
Why is he always
talking to me like that?

506
00:37:53,984 --> 00:37:55,000
It's okay.

507
00:37:55,892 --> 00:37:57,676
- Why do you think, Henry?
- I don't know.

508
00:37:58,188 --> 00:37:59,559
You gonna tell me?
Why not?

509
00:38:02,124 --> 00:38:04,085
I just try to prove myself to you, sir.

510
00:38:04,874 --> 00:38:06,515
Think you ever prove yourself to me?

511
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:09,152
Aftewhat you did today?
You can't prove yourself to me.

512
00:38:09,309 --> 00:38:11,595
You can never prove yourself.
What are you looking at?

513
00:38:11,944 --> 00:38:13,058
Mind your business!

514
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:18,772
Okay, that's enough.

515
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,431
How dare you talk to me like that?

516
00:38:22,887 --> 00:38:24,704
How dare you
be the one to challenge me?

517
00:38:25,025 --> 00:38:27,018
Did I take a fall for you?
Didn't I take a fall?

518
00:38:27,124 --> 00:38:28,967
Didn't I put my life
and my honor on the line

519
00:38:29,026 --> 00:38:30,446
to save your ass, didn't I do that?

520
00:38:30,499 --> 00:38:32,562
- I'm asking you to stop...
- Boy, you answer me!

521
00:38:32,981 --> 00:38:34,857
Answer me,
didn't I put my life and my honor

522
00:38:34,994 --> 00:38:36,851
and everything on the line
to save your ass?

523
00:38:37,198 --> 00:38:38,928
You want me to get down
and kiss your feet

524
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:40,666
for the rest of my life, is that it?

525
00:38:42,902 --> 00:38:44,427
Thank you, Sarge.
Thank you.

526
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:47,873
Well done, Sarge.

527
00:38:48,657 --> 00:38:49,908
Don't talk to me

528
00:38:50,298 --> 00:38:52,624
like I'm a stupid idiot,
because I'm not.

529
00:38:53,124 --> 00:38:54,749
No, you're not.
You know what you are?

530
00:38:55,693 --> 00:38:57,745
What?
You're a three tour Corporal.

531
00:38:58,313 --> 00:39:00,563
That's all you're ever gonna be.
A three-tour Corporal.

532
00:39:00,873 --> 00:39:01,873
That's it.

533
00:39:02,313 --> 00:39:04,167
The war breeds leaders and machines.

534
00:39:04,812 --> 00:39:05,910
So which one are you, man?

535
00:39:06,314 --> 00:39:07,942
- I'm a leader.
- Huh, which one is he?

536
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:09,313
Don't do this, Sarge.

537
00:39:09,561 --> 00:39:12,214
Are you a leader, or are you a machine?
Or maybe you're neither.

538
00:39:14,498 --> 00:39:15,498
Are you neither?

539
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:17,563
- I'm gonna get transpo, Sarge.
- Good.

540
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,301
I'm getting 1013 out of here.

541
00:39:19,437 --> 00:39:20,783
Because you can't do it.

542
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,317
You had your chance,
and you couldn't do it.

543
00:39:23,562 --> 00:39:24,596
You do it, go ahead.

544
00:39:24,674 --> 00:39:26,853
Get on a bus, man,
get on a plane, get on a boat.

545
00:39:27,249 --> 00:39:28,476
And do it, get out of here.

546
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,654
- I will.
- All right.

547
00:39:29,728 --> 00:39:31,573
Good luck, man,
'cause nobody's ever made it.

548
00:39:31,632 --> 00:39:32,562
You know why?

549
00:39:32,938 --> 00:39:33,983
'Cause you can't make it.

550
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:35,498
It'll never happen.

551
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,863
Because you're not a leader,
Henry Roman.

552
00:39:39,662 --> 00:39:40,835
Please don't do this, Sarge.

553
00:39:41,187 --> 00:39:42,187
'Cause you're nothing.

554
00:39:43,124 --> 00:39:44,124
Don't do this.

555
00:39:44,438 --> 00:39:45,438
Nothing, clown.

556
00:39:47,814 --> 00:39:49,450
Platoon follows you and you're dead.

557
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:52,847
And everybody's dead.

558
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,750
I gotta go, Sarge.

559
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:10,920
It's time for me to go.

560
00:40:14,807 --> 00:40:16,422
- What are you doing, man?
- Get him!

561
00:40:17,045 --> 00:40:18,511
What are you doing, man?
Come here!

562
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:26,467
Come here.

563
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:28,026
Mike, don't go out.
Come here.

564
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:38,375
Yo, Cap.

565
00:40:38,814 --> 00:40:41,063
We got movement.
Somebody's coming out.

566
00:40:41,811 --> 00:40:42,811
All right.

567
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,250
Let's go.

568
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:46,224
Mike, come on.

569
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:50,852
Mike, come back here!

570
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,665
Snipes, hold position.

571
00:40:53,724 --> 00:40:54,741
Hold fire!

572
00:40:54,811 --> 00:40:57,401
Ground crew's got the shot,
ground crew has got the shot.

573
00:41:05,603 --> 00:41:06,932
What's wrong with your man, Wolf?

574
00:41:07,061 --> 00:41:08,378
He's unarmed, he's unarmed!

575
00:41:08,665 --> 00:41:10,108
Just leave him alone, he's unarmed.

576
00:41:11,188 --> 00:41:12,188
He's unarmed.

577
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:15,497
Come on, move back, move back.
He's unarmed.

578
00:41:17,436 --> 00:41:18,436
Mike, mike, come here.

579
00:41:18,747 --> 00:41:19,747
Come here, man.

580
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:23,498
Come on, little brother, come on.

581
00:41:25,498 --> 00:41:27,894
Come on, Mike, think about it.
Don't do anything stupid.

582
00:41:31,812 --> 00:41:33,402
Horst, he's unarmed, man, back off.

583
00:41:36,311 --> 00:41:37,770
What are you doing, man, come here?

584
00:41:40,929 --> 00:41:42,708
What are you doing?
Come inside, please.
