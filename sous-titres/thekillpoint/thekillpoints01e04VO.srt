<i>Previously on</i> The Kill Point.

2
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:09,325
This's a bank robbery.
Follow these simple instructions,

3
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:11,689
and we can all walk out of here,
safe and sound.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,942
Pull back!

5
00:00:13,102 --> 00:00:14,957
This is now a hostage situation.
Who's this?

6
00:00:15,202 --> 00:00:17,180
- Captain Horst Cali.
- I'm Wolf.

7
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:20,947
Alan Beck is indeed at the scene as his
daughter Ashley is one of the hostages.

8
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:22,464
One hour or a hostage.

9
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:24,800
Follow these instructions.
If you don't, your daughter

10
00:00:24,922 --> 00:00:27,042
and my son
aren't gonna make it out of the bank.

11
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,499
- Platoon 10-13.
- Let's get our boys home.

12
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:31,798
It's time
we took matters into our own hands.

13
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:33,624
- We're coming out.
- Sniper on the roof.

14
00:00:33,775 --> 00:00:35,320
I'm gonna put blood on your hands.

15
00:02:02,032 --> 00:02:03,326
Oh, my god!

16
00:02:04,303 --> 00:02:05,694
Oh, man!

17
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:07,952
Back up...
Back up!

18
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:10,990
- What'd you do?!
- Back, move!

19
00:02:11,186 --> 00:02:12,444
- Jesus!
- Move!

20
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:14,724
You son of a bitch!

21
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:16,130
You son of a bitch!

22
00:02:17,421 --> 00:02:18,865
Let him go.
Let him go.

23
00:02:21,881 --> 00:02:23,980
This is bad.
We need an ambulance now.

24
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:25,763
My guy said they heard screaming inside.

25
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,044
Call him.
Find out what happened.

26
00:02:28,339 --> 00:02:29,609
Come on, come on.

27
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:34,430
We heard a shot.
What's going on?

28
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:37,158
We got a woman shot in the face.
We need emts in here now.

29
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,281
<i>Unarmed, got it?</i>

30
00:02:38,403 --> 00:02:40,271
- What did you just say?
<i>- It's an accident.</i>

31
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,174
Look, I don't have time for this.

32
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,311
<i>Get the emts in here now.</i>

33
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,435
Send in the emts.

34
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:05,445
- She gonna make it?
- Don't know.

35
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:07,064
Somebody in there worked on her.

36
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,635
Bought her some time.

37
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,604
A 20-year-old girl, Connie.

38
00:03:16,836 --> 00:03:18,826
- It's not your fault, cap.
- Not my fault?

39
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,913
I'm assuming that Wolf's in control.

40
00:03:21,036 --> 00:03:23,367
If I was wrong,
if he's not in control...

41
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:25,030
Then all bets are off.

Episode 1x04
Transcript: swsub.com / Sync: DarKsh

43
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:35,820
Is that my daughter?

44
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,896
Is that Ashley?
God damn you,

45
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,032
you tell me if that's my daughter!

46
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:44,521
It's Cass Conforth, Alan.

47
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,594
What's the play, Sarge?

48
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,286
Look, I don't know what he's capable of.

49
00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:26,717
So we'll just hold our posts
and be ready to roll, all right?

50
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:34,242
Come on, Mike, come on.

51
00:04:35,731 --> 00:04:38,441
Don't hold it against yourself, man.
It was just an accident.

52
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,876
She was 20, Sarge.

53
00:04:41,901 --> 00:04:43,048
20 at best.

54
00:04:45,026 --> 00:04:46,503
And it was no accident.

55
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:47,983
Yeah.

56
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:50,939
We brought violence
to these people, okay?

57
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:54,706
We did bad shit over there,
and now we're doing bad shit here.

58
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,810
Can't you see, man?
We're like...

59
00:04:57,867 --> 00:04:59,551
a traveling virus.

60
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:02,604
Just spreading our shit
all over the world now.

61
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:09,726
Here, Mike, you're gonna need this, man.

62
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,709
Chloe, come here.

63
00:05:33,248 --> 00:05:34,713
Can you do me a favor?

64
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:38,351
See if you can help out
with those two over there.

65
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:51,603
Cali, I've got every news channel

66
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:54,545
running that girl being wheeled
out of the bank over and over again.

67
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:56,559
Everyone ask me
why we do nothing about it.

68
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,384
The more I'm talking to you,
the less I can spend talking to Wolf.

69
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:02,043
I cover you with the press,
but if it doesn't feel right soon,

70
00:06:02,165 --> 00:06:04,041
- we're going in.
- All right.

71
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,069
Okay.

72
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:16,602
- What happened, sergeant?
<i>- An accidental discharge.</i>

73
00:06:16,903 --> 00:06:17,992
Girl caught a stray.

74
00:06:18,114 --> 00:06:19,917
<i>- It's nobody's fault.</i>
- That is debatable.

75
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:23,644
- Yeah, it is.
<i>- We've had a good understanding so far.</i>

76
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:26,236
You control your people, I control mine.

77
00:06:26,423 --> 00:06:28,919
I am in control.
My men follow my orders at all times.

78
00:06:29,124 --> 00:06:31,644
<i>It was just an accident.
I just pray that the girl makes it.</i>

79
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:34,479
If that's true, and you are in control,
and this was, in fact,

80
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:37,834
<i>an accident, then this shooting
is even more troublesome than I thought.</i>

81
00:06:38,002 --> 00:06:39,993
Because it means
that it can happen again.

82
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:43,345
Hey, look, it's not gonna happen again.

83
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,006
You can't guarantee that an accident
won't happen again, can you, Mr. Wolf?

84
00:06:47,143 --> 00:06:48,697
No, I can't guarantee it.

85
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:50,010
<i>Then you have to accept</i>

86
00:06:50,132 --> 00:06:51,907
the fact
that another hostage can get shot

87
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:53,251
<i>no matter what you do.</i>

88
00:06:53,438 --> 00:06:54,442
Cap.

89
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,576
<i>- Cass may not make it, sergeant.</i>
- I thought she was stabilized.

90
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:01,782
She's critical.

91
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:03,374
<i>Jake...</i>

92
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:06,154
I know you went in that bank
because you want something back.

93
00:07:06,586 --> 00:07:08,594
<i>Now you wanna make a statement
with your demands,</i>

94
00:07:08,821 --> 00:07:10,859
about the country, about the war.

95
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:15,122
Making a point about this government's
hypocrisy is worth this girl's life?

96
00:07:16,691 --> 00:07:17,799
I don't know anymore.

97
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:20,306
<i>You thought you could control it...
You can't.</i>

98
00:07:20,503 --> 00:07:22,005
<i>Do the honorable thing, sergeant.</i>

99
00:07:22,465 --> 00:07:25,752
Walk out the door, save lives.
You have that power.

100
00:07:26,024 --> 00:07:27,340
Look, captain, I...

101
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:30,538
I never wanted this to happen.
I just... I'm open...

102
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,423
We lost him... Get him back.
Come on, now!

103
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,106
What are you doing?

104
00:07:41,865 --> 00:07:43,495
We'll call you back, captain.

105
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:46,423
Who was that?

106
00:07:47,109 --> 00:07:49,119
I need you
to understand something, Sarge.

107
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,184
- Explain.
- Okay...

108
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:52,898
I will never surrender.

109
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,161
There were civvies killed in Fallujah.

110
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,884
We didn't stop the ops there.
Why stop here?

111
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:02,292
These people's lives
worth more than iraqi civilians?

112
00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:06,010
That girl was an acceptable casualty.

113
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:08,526
All of these people are.

114
00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:11,550
You understand that I was trying
to keep 'em from storming the bank?

115
00:08:11,672 --> 00:08:13,531
- Do you understand that?
- Yes, sir.

116
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:15,757
- What are you trying to prove?
- Nothing, sir.

117
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,113
- You're trying to prove something, uh?
- No, sir.

118
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:20,377
- Don't ever grab that phone again.
- Yes, sir.

119
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,445
- Know your place, corporal.
- I will, sir.

120
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:24,487
Beck's back.

121
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,247
Cap, we gotta talk strategy.

122
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,158
Can't buy more time, Cali.

123
00:08:46,763 --> 00:08:48,970
The press is in a feeding frenzy.
The hostages' fam...

124
00:08:49,374 --> 00:08:50,350
We're going in.

125
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:54,128
Good.
What's the time line?

126
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,762
Wait, hold on.

127
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:58,158
Are you sure?
Wolf sounded defeated...

128
00:08:58,278 --> 00:08:59,599
- Talk to him.
- Doesn't matter.

129
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:01,364
Somebody else hung up that phone.

130
00:09:02,256 --> 00:09:05,458
Our plan won't work
if I don't know who's calling the shots.

131
00:09:06,316 --> 00:09:07,761
- We're going in.
- You know

132
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:09,667
he's looking for us to move in.

133
00:09:10,437 --> 00:09:11,528
We take no action,

134
00:09:11,657 --> 00:09:14,023
we lose more hostages anyway.
The last incident proves it.

135
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:17,216
I'll get the press and civilians
pushed back. Let's go.

136
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:20,952
Get your team in place, Connie.

137
00:09:21,488 --> 00:09:23,207
- Come up with a breach plan.
- Cap...

138
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,390
God damn it,
am I asking your opinion right now?!

139
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,145
We're going in.

140
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:34,564
Teams,

141
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:36,769
prep for full tactical breach.

142
00:10:11,655 --> 00:10:14,096
I feel like I'm being punished, Jim,

143
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:18,218
for every duplicitous deal
and lie I've ever told.

144
00:10:18,776 --> 00:10:21,382
And Ashley's been dragged
into my penance.

145
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,508
Real question is,
what happens if I get her back?

146
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,001
Alan, answer the phone.

147
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,010
Do what you do best.

148
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:30,867
Worry about the rest later.

149
00:10:37,214 --> 00:10:38,332
Is my daughter okay?

150
00:10:38,698 --> 00:10:40,107
Yeah, yeah, she's fine.

151
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,966
How are we gonna resolve this?

152
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:45,525
<i>I want you to find the weak spot, okay?
Every system's got a weak spot.</i>

153
00:10:45,703 --> 00:10:49,259
You finance our exit, and you'll see
your daughter's face again...

154
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,025
without a hole in it.

155
00:10:51,145 --> 00:10:53,044
<i>Okay, I can find a weak spot.</i>

156
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:56,225
But know this, sergeant,
if you hurt my daughter,

157
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,401
I'll have that god damn bank nuked,
so help me God.

158
00:10:59,636 --> 00:11:01,827
Just call me when you make progress.

159
00:11:07,803 --> 00:11:08,965
What does he want?

160
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:11,160
He wants to buy his freedom.

161
00:11:13,543 --> 00:11:15,562
- I'm gonna handle this one, Jim.
- Alan...

162
00:11:15,785 --> 00:11:18,555
No, no.
I'm gonna handle this one.

163
00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:25,848
What's the deal?

164
00:11:26,548 --> 00:11:27,945
We're in business with Beck.

165
00:11:28,163 --> 00:11:30,879
He's gonna finance our exit.
You happy, Rabbit?

166
00:11:31,803 --> 00:11:33,369
Yeah, that sounds good, Sarge,

167
00:11:33,497 --> 00:11:36,074
but I just took a peek outside, and...
we might not have time.

168
00:11:36,203 --> 00:11:38,426
There's a lot of movement and SWAT.

169
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:40,011
Something's up.

170
00:12:00,695 --> 00:12:01,502
Cap...

171
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,019
All due respect, I think you should

172
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,352
pick up the phone.

173
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:13,758
I know you're hurt, and this makes you
question your tactics.

174
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:15,355
Shit, I'm your SWAT commander.

175
00:12:15,475 --> 00:12:18,764
I'm supposed to be hopped up for action,
but I got a feeling this ain't the move.

176
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,600
I'm not saving them one at a time,
I'm risking them.

177
00:12:23,383 --> 00:12:25,966
I read Wolf wrong.
I have to correct my mistake now.

178
00:12:26,341 --> 00:12:28,370
Dude, these guys
are willing to go all in.

179
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:31,534
- We breach, they shoot to kill. Who...
- I know the situation.

180
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,041
I know the risks
involved in my decision.

181
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:43,588
Face to face.
Outside,

182
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:44,978
now.

183
00:13:00,932 --> 00:13:03,148
- I thought you gave up on me, cap.
- Shouldn't I?

184
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:05,336
'Cause I thought we had a business deal.
Now,

185
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:08,105
I don't know if the man
I'm speaking to is in control in there.

186
00:13:08,363 --> 00:13:10,767
Come on, that was just
a miscommunication, that's all.

187
00:13:10,993 --> 00:13:12,110
A miscommunication?

188
00:13:12,232 --> 00:13:16,580
I'd say that a hostage shot in the face
is a more than a miscommunication.

189
00:13:17,031 --> 00:13:19,238
It seems to me
like you lost control, sergeant.

190
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:21,651
This thing is over now.
It's time to give it up.

191
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,238
It's not an order that I know.

192
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:26,008
All right.
Makes my decision a lot easier.

193
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,975
Hey, cap, let me just ask you...
Did you actually kill somebody?

194
00:13:29,717 --> 00:13:31,858
- Did you really?
- How is that relevant?

195
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:35,545
This could be
our last conversation together, right?

196
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,646
Were they all righteous shootings?

197
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,349
They were justified.

198
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:43,394
- Justified?
- Yeah.

199
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,173
- That help you sleep any better?
- This is bullshit.

200
00:13:46,587 --> 00:13:49,009
- This is not about me...
- No, it is about you, completly,

201
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:50,192
and you know it.

202
00:13:50,515 --> 00:13:52,646
Why become a negotiator?
From bullets to blab, why?

203
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:55,576
Because you didn't feel bad?
Did that freak you out?

204
00:13:56,318 --> 00:13:58,054
- You don't know me.
- You don't think so?

205
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:02,186
Your propensity for violence is
what's getting you in trouble, isn't it?

206
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,435
I'm gonna walk back.

207
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:10,149
If I get back there, and I don't know
that you're in complete control...

208
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:12,731
- The deal's done.
- I'm in control, man.

209
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
That was an accident.

210
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,934
But if you give the order, it's the same
as you pulling the trigger.

211
00:14:17,054 --> 00:14:18,054
Can you live with that?

212
00:14:18,242 --> 00:14:20,749
You wanna be that guy, go ahead.
Go ahead and give the order.

213
00:14:21,353 --> 00:14:24,257
Go ahead, man.
Go get a little taste of power.

214
00:14:25,975 --> 00:14:27,835
If you're in control, I want two.

215
00:14:28,407 --> 00:14:30,154
You get two because I say so.

216
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:39,947
Hey, Piggy, go get Karen.

217
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:41,356
Karen, you're going.

218
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,083
I'll pray for you, okay?

219
00:14:55,435 --> 00:14:56,534
Good-bye.

220
00:14:58,411 --> 00:15:00,204
Come on, sweetie.
Marykim,

221
00:15:00,739 --> 00:15:02,045
you're going home.

222
00:15:02,592 --> 00:15:03,493
Rabbit.

223
00:15:06,687 --> 00:15:08,574
I'll be okay, all right?
I'm right behind you.

224
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:09,858
Okay.

225
00:15:10,245 --> 00:15:11,503
You better be.

226
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:14,088
Let's go.
Come on, come on.

227
00:15:42,002 --> 00:15:44,378
First team alpha, stand down.

228
00:15:44,763 --> 00:15:47,063
Bravo, Charlie, fall back and hold.

229
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:51,326
Sarge, they're withdrawing.

230
00:16:01,678 --> 00:16:03,725
Let's get an emt...
Come on!

231
00:16:04,072 --> 00:16:05,359
It's all right.

232
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:08,222
No, no, no, please don't let me go.

233
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,955
Please, please.

234
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:12,494
It's all right.

235
00:16:22,654 --> 00:16:23,654
Hey, babe.

236
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:25,780
No, no, I'm fine.

237
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,727
Tell me about your day.

238
00:16:30,126 --> 00:16:32,243
No, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

239
00:16:33,163 --> 00:16:34,421
What did you eat?

240
00:16:37,003 --> 00:16:38,167
No, you're not fat.

241
00:16:39,726 --> 00:16:41,763
I must say, this is unexpected.

242
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:44,498
You said
you wanted a private conversation?

243
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,822
The hostage situation downtown...

244
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,217
My daughter is in that bank.

245
00:16:54,553 --> 00:16:56,188
I need you to find someone

246
00:16:56,817 --> 00:16:58,771
who can have an influence
on that situation.

247
00:16:59,295 --> 00:17:02,779
I don't care how far you have to go
or how deep you have to dig.

248
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:05,051
Just get what I need.

249
00:17:05,652 --> 00:17:07,877
I can probably help you out with that.

250
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:10,639
But they're expensive connections.

251
00:17:11,746 --> 00:17:13,690
You'll be compensated for your trouble.

252
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:15,561
Count on that.

253
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:17,540
Get it done.

254
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,860
Let me know what the cost is.
It's that simple.

255
00:17:21,592 --> 00:17:23,646
You can ride this car back down.

256
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:26,607
I'll pick up the fare.

257
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:35,320
Hey, help me.
Take her over with the others.

258
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:37,263
Come on.

259
00:17:54,804 --> 00:17:55,809
Hey, Bernard...

260
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,324
Aren't...
Aren't you scared?

261
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:00,823
How do you...

262
00:18:00,945 --> 00:18:03,143
How do you let all this
just wash right over you?

263
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:04,739
It doesn't wash off, Abe.

264
00:18:05,622 --> 00:18:07,472
Scares the bejesus out of me.

265
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:11,190
I fill my thoughts with something else.

266
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:14,316
Something that brings me strength.

267
00:18:14,547 --> 00:18:15,659
Like what?

268
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:19,830
All those things that were said...

269
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,230
done to me my whole life...

270
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:24,704
I use them.

271
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:27,918
Use the anger that they bring.

272
00:18:29,516 --> 00:18:31,007
Anger is better than fear.

273
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:34,021
Pissed off is better than terrified.

274
00:18:34,256 --> 00:18:36,143
But she was shot right over there!

275
00:18:36,556 --> 00:18:37,814
Right there, she was shot!

276
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,948
I mean, I don't feel angry.

277
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:43,672
That's not what I'm feeling.
I'm... I'm scared.

278
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,470
I'm really scared.
I'm overwhelmed by it.

279
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:48,150
That's why you're bald.

280
00:18:48,949 --> 00:18:49,954
What?

281
00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:52,856
Your bowel movements must be revolting.

282
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:55,420
Your insides
are rotten from all this fear.

283
00:18:55,547 --> 00:18:57,514
- What are you talking about?
- You're probably

284
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,323
gonna piss your pants, and eventually
have a massive heart attack

285
00:19:00,443 --> 00:19:02,077
and die suddenly right here.

286
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:03,823
You...

287
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:06,941
God damn son of a bitch!

288
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,649
You are one mean, gay bastard,

289
00:19:11,772 --> 00:19:12,819
you know that?

290
00:19:13,214 --> 00:19:16,613
Why don't you just take your advice and
just shove it right up your ass, huh?!

291
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:17,852
Right up yours!

292
00:19:17,975 --> 00:19:19,036
Yeah?

293
00:19:24,551 --> 00:19:25,658
What's so funny?

294
00:19:30,932 --> 00:19:33,515
You afraid right now, Mr. Shelton?

295
00:19:37,515 --> 00:19:38,520
Mr. Wolf?

296
00:19:40,294 --> 00:19:41,425
Mr. Wolf?

297
00:19:42,604 --> 00:19:43,676
Mr. Wolf?

298
00:20:08,443 --> 00:20:10,261
You know I can wiggle my ears,
Johnny Boy?

299
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:13,604
Cross my eyes.

300
00:20:15,017 --> 00:20:17,311
Shit, I can even do one eyebrow raised.

301
00:20:18,287 --> 00:20:19,585
Tricks of the face trade,

302
00:20:19,707 --> 00:20:22,354
you know?
53 muscles rule the human mug.

303
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,358
Each one buys us limitless expression.

304
00:20:27,817 --> 00:20:29,983
I'm the hijacker
of all those expressions.

305
00:20:31,847 --> 00:20:36,494
Like a ghost in my subjects' world,
robbing them of their final headmark.

306
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:39,215
Yet they know nothing of me.

307
00:20:41,815 --> 00:20:45,285
So therefore, how can they perform
their final masterpiece?

308
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,913
That expression of pure,

309
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:51,323
unadulterated fear.

310
00:21:00,835 --> 00:21:03,021
I see you assholes.

311
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:06,346
This is all very exciting, D.

312
00:21:06,647 --> 00:21:08,324
They got a lot of firepower down there.

313
00:21:08,446 --> 00:21:09,530
Relax, Leon.

314
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,327
They ain't lookin' at us, brother.

315
00:21:12,893 --> 00:21:14,042
We're looking at them.

316
00:21:14,513 --> 00:21:16,067
Lock down the scene.
I wanna know

317
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:19,816
when we I.D. the body. Hey, cap,
I think we may have found our shooter.

318
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:22,321
They got a body on the roof.
White male, 30s.

319
00:21:22,717 --> 00:21:25,345
No I.D, he had a sniper rifle.
My guys think he's a pro.

320
00:21:25,465 --> 00:21:27,308
And he had a clear line of sight
to the bank.

321
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:30,073
Who the hell contracts
a sniper to pick off Wolf?

322
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,049
Who has the means?
The motive and the connections

323
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,677
to hire a professional sniper?
My guess...

324
00:21:36,623 --> 00:21:38,814
if you shot him
while he's holding your daughter,

325
00:21:38,946 --> 00:21:41,563
there's a good chance
she's gonna run free.

326
00:21:41,903 --> 00:21:44,258
- Son of a bitch.
- Yeah, son of a bitch is right.

327
00:21:47,303 --> 00:21:49,639
Let's get Beck in here,
interrogate his ass.

328
00:21:49,881 --> 00:21:51,852
That's a waste of time.
He won't talk.

329
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:56,549
Bring me Teddy Sabian.

330
00:21:57,099 --> 00:21:58,628
Time to break the fat man.

331
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:12,114
You go home to take a piss?

332
00:22:12,413 --> 00:22:13,584
I spoke to Lou.

333
00:22:14,139 --> 00:22:15,684
The breach is completely dead.

334
00:22:16,174 --> 00:22:18,039
Negotiations back on.

335
00:22:18,727 --> 00:22:20,789
This might be
the shittiest day of all time.

336
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,512
- What now?
- God damn pirates.

337
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,535
They blew it in the ninth.
I take yet another bath.

338
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:27,738
Pirates?

339
00:22:33,428 --> 00:22:36,237
- The bank's right upstairs, Hawke.
- Augie, relax, man.

340
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:39,044
Getting all hepped up is what got us
ripped off the perimeter.

341
00:22:39,771 --> 00:22:42,294
Is that what you want?
You just want to wait it out?

342
00:22:42,764 --> 00:22:44,662
Look, you know how Cali works.

343
00:22:44,895 --> 00:22:46,438
We're never gonna get payback.

344
00:22:46,584 --> 00:22:49,819
Zing's gone, at their hand,
and we're gonna sit and wait?

345
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,263
I'm not saying we bust in blazing.
I'm saying

346
00:22:54,423 --> 00:22:56,072
we find the right way in.

347
00:22:57,349 --> 00:22:59,971
They ain't breaching
'cause they can't find a hole.

348
00:23:00,508 --> 00:23:02,006
So let's find a hole.

349
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,851
- Let's find a hole.
- Let's get in there.

350
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:13,908
You'll be getting a call in
the next five minutes with more details.

351
00:23:14,474 --> 00:23:17,854
- Can we count on this guy, Mr. Doyle?
<i>- He knows the repercussions</i>

352
00:23:17,995 --> 00:23:20,251
if he doesn't come through for me.

353
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,341
Hey, Mikey,

354
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,489
how's it going?

355
00:23:35,005 --> 00:23:38,122
I'm proud of you, man,
hanging on in there like that.

356
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,059
What do you got for me?

357
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:49,591
Man on our side.
Waiting on the final details.

358
00:23:49,711 --> 00:23:51,446
<i>Your daughter's coming with us.
Got that?</i>

359
00:23:51,582 --> 00:23:53,543
When we're free and clear,
she's free and clear.

360
00:23:53,663 --> 00:23:54,599
<i>I figured that.</i>

361
00:23:55,055 --> 00:23:57,378
I'll call you back
once everything's set.

362
00:24:13,198 --> 00:24:14,536
Clear the observation deck.

363
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:20,545
Why am I up here again?
I... I told you everything.

364
00:24:21,647 --> 00:24:23,370
You ever hear
of a cuban cocktail, Teddy?

365
00:24:23,697 --> 00:24:25,905
- What?
- A cuban cocktail.

366
00:24:26,446 --> 00:24:29,766
It's a mixture...
of blood, urine, semen,

367
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,405
excrement.

368
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:36,444
This appetizing blend
is then placed in the sunlight for days

369
00:24:36,783 --> 00:24:38,883
so it ages, ripens.

370
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,502
It's then thrown in a newbie's face.
You know what a newbie is?

371
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:44,253
It's a newcomer in prison.

372
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,546
Now, here's the interesting omit.

373
00:24:51,477 --> 00:24:52,909
The blood ingredient,

374
00:24:53,828 --> 00:24:57,438
that's usually taken from one
of the many prisoners infected with HIV.

375
00:24:57,877 --> 00:25:00,688
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because you're going to prison.

376
00:25:02,412 --> 00:25:03,542
I don't understand.

377
00:25:03,818 --> 00:25:05,208
Stop bullshitting me!

378
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:09,320
Why did Wolf
let you walk out of that bank?

379
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:11,008
He needed you, didn't he?

380
00:25:13,002 --> 00:25:15,571
See, when a man walks out of that bank,
not a boy, not a woman,

381
00:25:15,971 --> 00:25:19,941
but a fat, disgusting,
worthless, piece-of-shit slob of a man,

382
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:21,697
such as yourself...

383
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:23,558
I just can't shake that.

384
00:25:24,164 --> 00:25:27,281
It makes me think Wolf needed leverage.
He's got plenty with you, hasn't he?

385
00:25:27,689 --> 00:25:28,963
I haven't done anything wrong.

386
00:25:29,086 --> 00:25:31,383
- I've done nothing wrong.
- Keep denying it.

387
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:34,661
It's all gonna come out now.
I've got a dead sniper a block away.

388
00:25:34,953 --> 00:25:37,769
I'm gonna tie that sniper to Alan Beck,
and guess what he's gonna do?

389
00:25:37,892 --> 00:25:39,466
He'll tell me everything I need to know

390
00:25:39,602 --> 00:25:42,209
- about you.
- I don't know anything about a sniper.

391
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,101
I swear on my life.

392
00:25:44,466 --> 00:25:45,766
I never said you knew.

393
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:56,056
I'm gonna give you

394
00:25:56,235 --> 00:25:58,910
one last chance to talk to me...
Okay?

395
00:26:00,415 --> 00:26:01,709
You do that, Teddy,

396
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:03,772
there's no charges,

397
00:26:04,553 --> 00:26:05,859
no cocktail...

398
00:26:06,763 --> 00:26:07,764
Nothing.

399
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:13,367
For chrissake, Teddy,
help me get you your boy back.

400
00:26:13,868 --> 00:26:14,893
Talk to me.

401
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:18,546
I can't do this.

402
00:26:23,892 --> 00:26:25,272
Get out of my face.

403
00:26:27,477 --> 00:26:28,477
Now!

404
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:43,396
I don't know where all these vents lead.

405
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,616
Me neither.

406
00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:46,111
We need a grid map.

407
00:26:46,681 --> 00:26:49,874
You know they ain't gonna give us that.
That's totally against protocol.

408
00:26:49,994 --> 00:26:52,822
Well, go up and ask Tonray
if he can at least take a look at 'em.

409
00:26:55,348 --> 00:26:58,137
We got no case to breach
if we can't find a safe access point.

410
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:05,092
Okay, I'll go up and I'll ask him.
But if he thinks something is up,

411
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:07,843
- I'm out.
- Alright.

412
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,666
We're on rotations.

413
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:19,366
Go take a break...

414
00:27:20,058 --> 00:27:21,225
A half hour.

415
00:27:42,676 --> 00:27:43,889
Any idea on the snipers?

416
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,203
Not yet.
My guys are still working on it.

417
00:27:46,323 --> 00:27:47,323
I'm sorry.

418
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:54,402
I'm so sorry. I... I never committed
a crime in my whole life.

419
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:58,205
- But he's... He's got my son.
- What did you to, Teddy?

420
00:27:59,481 --> 00:28:00,927
It's okay, my offer's still good.

421
00:28:04,553 --> 00:28:07,614
I gave
these frequency codes to Alan Beck.

422
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:11,088
Robby is hoping the robbers

423
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:13,172
find a way to talk to him.
He threatened my son.

424
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:14,854
I didn't know what to do.

425
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,682
Get Mr. Sabian anything he wants.

426
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,853
- Son of a bitch! They talk.
- Wolf and Beck are talking...

427
00:28:20,975 --> 00:28:22,340
Tap into it.

428
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,787
Hey, Beck, I'm getting impatient
over here.

429
00:28:33,918 --> 00:28:35,495
<i>There'll be a knock in a vent.</i>

430
00:28:35,796 --> 00:28:39,251
I'm told it's the same spot
the SWAT team entered once before.

431
00:28:39,457 --> 00:28:41,269
There'll be a clear path out.

432
00:28:41,532 --> 00:28:42,828
<i>You can check it out,</i>

433
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,386
but it's legit.

434
00:28:45,353 --> 00:28:46,208
I got him...

435
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:49,438
- The line's in use.
<i>- Okay, I'm going over there right now.</i>

436
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:51,428
- Where?
- I don't know. Get it back.

437
00:28:58,866 --> 00:29:00,837
- You alone?
- Yeah.

438
00:29:12,274 --> 00:29:13,849
Come on, give it to me.

439
00:29:23,925 --> 00:29:25,164
What, we have a problem?

440
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:28,081
- No.
- I'm gonna check

441
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:31,405
the out first, and then my guys
are gonna follow me, so move!

442
00:30:06,962 --> 00:30:08,567
What the hell am I doing?

443
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:42,610
Alan, he said he would call you.

444
00:30:43,748 --> 00:30:45,952
I need to know if he made contact.

445
00:30:47,372 --> 00:30:48,372
Hang on.

446
00:30:48,873 --> 00:30:49,873
Who's that?

447
00:30:50,685 --> 00:30:52,273
It's the guy who hired you.

448
00:30:53,483 --> 00:30:55,323
Wait, wait, the line's in use.

449
00:30:55,624 --> 00:30:58,263
<i>Yeah, I'm with the SWAT guy now
in the subbasement tunnel.</i>

450
00:30:58,676 --> 00:30:59,878
Just checking it out.

451
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:03,990
No, Ashley's still inside.
Look, I'll call you when we're out.

452
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,136
Go ahead, move it.

453
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,491
- What's he mean he's with a SWAT guy?
- Let's go!

454
00:31:10,688 --> 00:31:12,547
- He's with a SWAT guy.
- Delta team...

455
00:31:12,716 --> 00:31:13,890
Wait, wait...
Don't...

456
00:31:14,012 --> 00:31:17,289
He's with a SWAT guy, one from your
team. If they leave through the tunnel,

457
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:19,824
- we'll get them there.
- Fine, let's go.

458
00:31:32,687 --> 00:31:34,272
Augie, I got him, I got him!

459
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:36,640
Don't do it, man.

460
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:38,893
Don't do it.

461
00:31:39,015 --> 00:31:41,512
You point your gun at me,
and you hang out with this scumbag.

462
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:43,390
Remember, it's the guy that killed Zing.

463
00:31:43,607 --> 00:31:45,954
- Make him lower his weapon now.
- Walk away.

464
00:31:46,217 --> 00:31:49,128
Walk away, H.
Trust me, please. I have to do this.

465
00:31:49,527 --> 00:31:52,584
You're pointing a gun in my face, man.
How am I supposed to trust you?

466
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,129
If you don't let us go,
your friend's a dead man.

467
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:58,265
Nobody's talking to you, asshole!
Augie, what's going on?

468
00:31:58,471 --> 00:32:00,612
I got in over my head
with the wrong people.

469
00:32:01,156 --> 00:32:04,236
They know where my family is, man.
My sister, her kids.

470
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:05,977
Do this...

471
00:32:06,743 --> 00:32:07,954
Please, for me.

472
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:09,226
Nobody has to know.

473
00:32:09,663 --> 00:32:11,978
I'll make it right.
Just let me walk with him,

474
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:13,482
- please!
- Who the hell are you?

475
00:32:13,606 --> 00:32:15,963
I don't know what you're talking about,
and why you point

476
00:32:16,085 --> 00:32:17,503
- your gun in my face!
- Sorry, H,

477
00:32:17,775 --> 00:32:21,240
- I never thought this would touch you.
- I'd listen to my friend if I was you.

478
00:32:27,089 --> 00:32:29,145
I can't let you go.
You know I can't let you go.

479
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:30,976
Put your weapons down now!

480
00:32:32,132 --> 00:32:33,089
Wolf!

481
00:32:35,051 --> 00:32:37,455
Augie, go easy, man.
Easy, easy, Aug.

482
00:32:37,802 --> 00:32:38,713
Ease up, Aug.

483
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,516
Just put it down, man.

484
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:45,421
Put it down, man.

485
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:47,037
Not like this, man.

486
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:49,171
No, Augie, stop.

487
00:32:49,723 --> 00:32:51,976
Come on, Aug.
Don't go out like this, man.

488
00:32:52,278 --> 00:32:53,713
We've been through too much...

489
00:32:54,153 --> 00:32:55,623
Give me the gun, come on.

490
00:32:56,773 --> 00:32:58,304
I can't take two in one day.

491
00:32:59,431 --> 00:33:02,375
Come on, give me your gun.
Come on...

492
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:04,186
Give me the gun.

493
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:06,125
Come on.

494
00:33:22,674 --> 00:33:24,073
You broke my heart, son.

495
00:33:36,363 --> 00:33:37,171
Hold it!

496
00:34:02,142 --> 00:34:04,559
I can confirm
that Alan Beck is in custody,

497
00:34:04,729 --> 00:34:07,720
though I cannot elaborate
on the details of his arrest pending

498
00:34:07,903 --> 00:34:11,704
a full investigation. What I can
tell you is that our hostage negotiator,

499
00:34:11,874 --> 00:34:15,990
Captain Horst Cali, along with
Pittsburgh P.D. and our SWAT team,

500
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,143
are in full command of the situation,
and focused on the task at hand.

501
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:22,493
Getting the hostages

502
00:34:22,653 --> 00:34:26,204
<i>out of harm's way remains our priority.</i>
<i>I won't take questions at this time.</i>

503
00:34:26,835 --> 00:34:29,699
<i>You'll all be briefed again
at the appropriate moment.</i>

504
00:34:33,461 --> 00:34:35,986
<i>We've also just received word
that Cassandra Conforth,</i>

505
00:34:36,136 --> 00:34:40,422
<i>who was shot earlier in the bank, is out
of surgery and is in stable condition</i>

506
00:34:40,573 --> 00:34:42,373
<i>- at this hour.</i>
- Mikey, you hear that?

507
00:34:43,595 --> 00:34:46,772
Mike, you hear that, little brother?
She's gonna be okay, man.

508
00:34:48,279 --> 00:34:50,936
Yeah, but we're not okay, Sarge.
None of us are okay.

509
00:34:52,405 --> 00:34:54,336
And we'll never be okay again.

510
00:35:00,868 --> 00:35:03,147
Okay, everybody, let's hit your posts.
Come on.

511
00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:06,312
Hold on.
What do we do now, Sarge?

512
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:09,439
- I don't know, we just wait.
- What do you mean you don't know?

513
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:40,971
What was that?

514
00:35:41,238 --> 00:35:42,463
I don't know.

515
00:35:43,251 --> 00:35:45,759
But it's getting dangerous now, baby.

516
00:35:46,127 --> 00:35:48,924
- We gotta get out of here.
- There's no way out.

517
00:35:49,387 --> 00:35:51,835
Maybe it's nothing.
Maybe there was no banging, you know.

518
00:35:51,957 --> 00:35:53,709
Maybe we were hallucinating.

519
00:35:54,347 --> 00:35:55,464
Explain that, baby?

520
00:35:55,659 --> 00:35:58,313
Not...
Not hallucinating, but maybe, like...

521
00:35:59,452 --> 00:36:00,460
audi-u-nating.

522
00:36:02,363 --> 00:36:04,887
We don't have any food or water.
What are we gonna do?

523
00:36:11,486 --> 00:36:12,803
What is that, water?

524
00:36:13,483 --> 00:36:14,564
I don't know.

525
00:36:16,903 --> 00:36:20,218
- No, don't do it, I'm scared.
- I'll protect you. I promise.

526
00:36:37,956 --> 00:36:40,094
They were like brothers to me, Con...

527
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:43,608
They were like the brothers I never had.

528
00:36:47,481 --> 00:36:50,326
This mean I'm going home now?
Are you taking me off?

529
00:36:51,317 --> 00:36:52,317
Hell no.

530
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,224
I need you, kid.

531
00:36:56,377 --> 00:36:58,435
I need all the good cops I can get.

532
00:37:11,471 --> 00:37:12,498
How's he doing?

533
00:37:12,705 --> 00:37:14,796
He's all right.
You calling Wolf?

534
00:37:15,222 --> 00:37:17,829
No, I'm gonna let him
stew in his defeat.

535
00:37:18,784 --> 00:37:21,455
- He'll realize he's out of moves.
- You heard about Cass?

536
00:37:22,284 --> 00:37:24,498
- No.
- She's gonna make it, Cap.

537
00:37:24,972 --> 00:37:26,363
Your watch is clean.

538
00:37:30,942 --> 00:37:31,942
Thank you.

539
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:40,448
I'm on my way to go deal with this
Beck debacle. Should take some time.

540
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:43,618
I know how much you're gonna miss me.

541
00:37:43,738 --> 00:37:45,141
- Oh, yeah.
- Just remember,

542
00:37:46,102 --> 00:37:47,487
I'm not really gone.

543
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,359
I'll speak to you.

544
00:37:49,889 --> 00:37:51,038
Okay, Chief.

545
00:38:18,466 --> 00:38:20,553
How can you look at me like that?

546
00:38:22,489 --> 00:38:23,872
How can you do that?

547
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:27,301
After everything I've done to everybody.

548
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:31,266
Everybody else sees me
for what I really am, except you... Why?

549
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,269
I watch you...

550
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,339
I see the way you are with us,
with that boy.

551
00:38:39,696 --> 00:38:40,996
I hear it in your voice

552
00:38:41,288 --> 00:38:43,480
when you come over here, when we talk.

553
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,924
Maybe I just see
a different side of you.

554
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:04,675
I'm really sorry
about what happened to your friend.

555
00:39:06,965 --> 00:39:09,988
I wish that would have never happened.
I wish...

556
00:39:10,968 --> 00:39:12,889
I wish a lot of things never happened.

557
00:39:17,395 --> 00:39:19,395
I'm just glad she's gonna be okay.

558
00:39:29,557 --> 00:39:31,732
I didn't mean to yell at you earlier.

559
00:39:32,365 --> 00:39:34,021
I was...
I was just upset.

560
00:39:57,765 --> 00:39:59,686
Why do you keep coming in here for?

561
00:40:00,534 --> 00:40:01,787
Close the door.

562
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,510
I dug a hole to the ladies' room.

563
00:40:16,304 --> 00:40:17,539
What...
What is that?

564
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,532
What do you have there?

565
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:28,344
This is a life source, brother.

566
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:31,113
Republican guard.

567
00:40:32,194 --> 00:40:33,841
Fifth Baghdad mech division.

568
00:40:36,615 --> 00:40:37,623
I did...

569
00:40:38,075 --> 00:40:40,778
things to him, Alby.

570
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:42,700
Things that...

571
00:40:43,727 --> 00:40:47,061
no man should bear,
or bear witness to.

572
00:40:48,193 --> 00:40:49,193
He never broke.

573
00:40:50,142 --> 00:40:51,263
Not once

574
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:57,169
did he waver
in his undying loyalty to his country.

575
00:40:58,158 --> 00:41:00,758
Well, it was my hope
that by taking a piece...

576
00:41:00,956 --> 00:41:04,704
just a piece of this great man with me,

577
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,200
that maybe I, too, could,

578
00:41:07,615 --> 00:41:12,494
you know, one day achieve that kind
of courage, or that kind of honor.

579
00:41:14,624 --> 00:41:15,631
Yeah.

580
00:41:16,446 --> 00:41:17,930
I want you to put this away.

581
00:41:19,005 --> 00:41:20,005
All right.

582
00:41:30,887 --> 00:41:31,887
Look at me.

583
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:33,600
- What?
- You're okay.

584
00:41:34,929 --> 00:41:35,965
You're okay.

585
00:41:37,057 --> 00:41:38,226
- All right?
- Yeah.

586
00:41:38,601 --> 00:41:40,351
- I'm okay.
- All right.

587
00:41:40,728 --> 00:41:41,540
Yeah.

588
00:41:42,472 --> 00:41:43,980
You guys need to see this.

589
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,166
Come on.

590
00:41:49,871 --> 00:41:51,331
You see?
You see that?

591
00:41:52,774 --> 00:41:55,511
I noticed it before, but
I didn't really pay it any attention.

592
00:41:55,632 --> 00:41:58,472
I thought it was some sniper laser,
but look at it.

593
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:00,743
- It's morse.
- Yeah, that's right, Hank.

594
00:42:00,863 --> 00:42:02,825
That's morse,
and you see what it's saying?

595
00:42:02,945 --> 00:42:03,945
Pro patria.

596
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,396
"For our country," man.

597
00:42:05,621 --> 00:42:08,042
That's our motto. It's 1013.
Deke is out there.

598
00:42:08,221 --> 00:42:10,331
Yes, he is, boys, that's right...
Yes, he is.

599
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:20,726
Guys...

600
00:42:21,301 --> 00:42:22,413
I think I got it.

601
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,602
I found a way to get our boys out.
