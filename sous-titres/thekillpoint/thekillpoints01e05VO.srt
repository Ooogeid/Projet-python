1
00:00:02,411 --> 00:00:03,805
<i>Previously on</i> The Kill Point...

2
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:04,936
This is a bank robbery.

3
00:00:05,058 --> 00:00:06,344
Follow these simple instructions

4
00:00:06,584 --> 00:00:08,515
and we can all walk
out of here safe and sound.

5
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:09,693
Fall back!

6
00:00:09,928 --> 00:00:11,932
This is now a hostage situation.
Who is this?

7
00:00:12,172 --> 00:00:14,183
- Captain Horst Cali.
- I'm wolf.

8
00:00:14,423 --> 00:00:17,925
Alan Beck is indeed at the scene and his
daughter Ashley is one of the hostages.

9
00:00:18,177 --> 00:00:20,814
- One hour, or I kill a hostage.
- Follow these instructions.

10
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:24,525
If you don't, your daughter and my son
will not make it out of the bank alive.

11
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:28,070
- What did you do, Teddy?
- I gave these frequency codes to Beck.

12
00:00:28,307 --> 00:00:30,757
<i>Finance our exit, and
you'll see your daughter's face again,</i>

13
00:00:30,877 --> 00:00:31,841
without a hole in it.

14
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:34,329
I think it's time
we took matters into our own hands.

15
00:00:34,505 --> 00:00:36,178
- We're coming out.
- Sniper on a roof.

16
00:00:36,298 --> 00:00:37,721
I'm gonna put blood on your hands.

17
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:41,349
- That girl was an acceptable casualty.
- Know your place, corporal.

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,041
- I want two.
- You get two because I say so.

19
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:46,168
Augie, I got him, i got him!

20
00:00:46,408 --> 00:00:47,544
Don't do it, man.

21
00:00:47,784 --> 00:00:49,087
You broke my heart, son.

22
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:52,590
If we can get the gun you stashed,
we've got this side of the bank covered.

23
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,857
- What about over there?
- We hire the rich kid.

24
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:56,885
That's morse.
You see what it's saying?

25
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,678
It's 1013.
Deacon's out there.

26
00:00:58,918 --> 00:01:01,764
Guys, I found a way to get our boys out.

27
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:12,050
Hey, Johnny...

28
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:16,301
Is a bullet a bullet
when it sits idle in the chamber?

29
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,827
Or is it only a bullet upon discharge?

30
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,048
I mean, like,

31
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,672
is a sniper only a sniper
when he puts down his prey?

32
00:01:32,986 --> 00:01:35,459
What if the one shot
don't happen here today?

33
00:01:36,987 --> 00:01:38,681
What's gonna happen to me?

34
00:01:41,175 --> 00:01:42,371
What about me?

35
00:01:46,145 --> 00:01:47,302
Who am I?

36
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:51,347
Right there.
Entry point.

37
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,141
Why can't we tunnel through the bank?

38
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:56,768
Banks are tunnel-proof.
Steel foundations.

39
00:01:57,008 --> 00:01:59,495
But this shitbox here doesn't have that.

40
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:01,647
But it's most likely covered
from the inside.

41
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:03,273
That's the problem, Leon.

42
00:02:03,513 --> 00:02:05,032
That's why we need the Sarge's help.

43
00:02:05,154 --> 00:02:07,527
We can't send a long message
via beacon, it'll be noticed.

44
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:09,028
Of course not.

45
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:11,572
Here's what we need to do.

46
00:02:11,812 --> 00:02:13,818
- Leon, you're on scrounger patrol.
- All right.

47
00:02:13,938 --> 00:02:16,535
Got it? Now, once you got
all the equipment, Derz, Stan,

48
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,412
- you become our tunnel kings.
- Cool.

49
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,206
Meantime, I need to find a way
to contact Sarge, talk to him,

50
00:02:22,446 --> 00:02:24,257
otherwise, this ain't gonna happen.

51
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:25,792
He's completely cut off, D.

52
00:02:26,032 --> 00:02:27,900
How the hell you gonna do that?

53
00:02:55,163 --> 00:02:56,830
A thank you would be nice.

54
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:03,323
Man, I protected your freedom.
The least you can do is say thank you.

55
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:06,301
Thank you.

56
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:14,582
Take off your pants.
Put your face on the floor.

57
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,005
Why are you doing this to me?

58
00:03:22,504 --> 00:03:23,506
Do it.

59
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:55,286
You're on a 15-hour patrol.

60
00:03:55,577 --> 00:03:58,948
Your feet would blister
until your entire heel peels off, man.

61
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,926
Then sniper shots
would ring out from a mile deep

62
00:04:02,046 --> 00:04:03,789
and take down three of your brothers.

63
00:04:04,865 --> 00:04:05,869
You...

64
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,804
run,

65
00:04:08,245 --> 00:04:10,480
and leave 'em, because...

66
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:13,241
well, because you're scared.

67
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,978
Every second of every day.

68
00:04:18,254 --> 00:04:19,594
You're always scared.

69
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:27,183
If you knew

70
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:29,175
a tenth of the fear, man...

71
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:32,762
you'd have offered me
a genuine thank you.

72
00:04:34,929 --> 00:04:35,953
Get up.

73
00:04:48,975 --> 00:04:49,980
Go.

74
00:04:55,989 --> 00:04:58,209
Episode 1x05
Transcript: swsub.com / Sync: DarKsh

75
00:04:58,449 --> 00:04:59,897
Whoa, what surprise?
What surprise?

76
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:02,826
No, no, no, honey,
I do not like surprises, okay?

77
00:05:02,948 --> 00:05:04,112
No surprises.

78
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:06,427
All right.
Okay, bye, sweetie.

79
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:10,886
Tonray's checked all the frequencies.
Wolf's completely cut off.

80
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,138
Good. He lost Beck.
Now he lost communication.

81
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,614
What's the move?

82
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:17,082
Now we make him lose hope.

83
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:19,438
How'd Lucy say you looked on TV?

84
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,945
Lucy said
that I looked like a cool asshole.

85
00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:23,688
- Sounds about right.
- I'll take it.

86
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,300
Come on.

87
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:30,402
<i>You know, you never cease
to surprise me, Mr. Wolf.</i>

88
00:05:30,552 --> 00:05:33,738
- Oh, yeah, why is that, Cap?
<i>- The stunt you pulled with Alan Beck.</i>

89
00:05:34,073 --> 00:05:35,603
That was very impressive.

90
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:38,409
- You've certainly kept me on my toes.
<i>- Kept?</i>

91
00:05:38,748 --> 00:05:40,327
Why the past tense, Cap?

92
00:05:40,617 --> 00:05:42,495
Past tense because it is over, Wolf.

93
00:05:43,547 --> 00:05:45,293
<i>It's time to surrender.
Now.</i>

94
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:48,571
I think you're misunderstanding
something about my plan.

95
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:50,043
I'm doing this for my men.

96
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:53,880
- You really expect me to believe that?
<i>- I don't care what you believe.</i>

97
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,979
I'm staying inside. I'm not leaving here
till my demands are met. You got that?

98
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:00,927
Well, I think we're done talking now?
Have a nice night.

99
00:06:05,358 --> 00:06:06,530
What was that?

100
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:08,057
Was that bullshit?

101
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:12,929
Maybe it was,
but apparently he believes it.

102
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:14,188
Tonray, get over here.

103
00:06:15,045 --> 00:06:18,341
Tonray, swear on your life that
our communication block is still up.

104
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:21,653
Not one open frequency. He's not talking
to anyone. I swear on my life.

105
00:06:22,368 --> 00:06:24,706
There is a chance, however,
that he spoke to someone else

106
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:26,596
before we discovered what he was up to.

107
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:28,658
Unlikely.
Someone else should have the codes...

108
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:32,203
Well, what if Beck did pass
the codes on to somebody else?

109
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:39,551
It's time to shift our focus.

110
00:06:39,987 --> 00:06:41,232
What do we do?

111
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,490
Okay...

112
00:06:43,006 --> 00:06:46,508
If he's spoken to someone else, then
we need to stop looking inside the bank,

113
00:06:46,631 --> 00:06:49,616
find out who it was
by looking outside the bank.

114
00:07:04,428 --> 00:07:07,232
We're making our move today.
We gotta get word to Ashley.

115
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:09,817
We can't do this without her.

116
00:07:14,372 --> 00:07:15,614
What's he want?

117
00:07:15,854 --> 00:07:19,242
Are you stupid? Just look at you.
These guys are trained soldiers.

118
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:22,701
The plan's never gonna work.
You're gonna get us all killed.

119
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,830
The longer we wait, the better
the chance something goes wrong.

120
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:29,264
Trust me.
We gotta go soon.

121
00:07:33,863 --> 00:07:35,714
Yeah.
I'm ready.

122
00:07:37,663 --> 00:07:40,801
- What's the message, Sarge?
- Hold right. I'm working on a plan.

123
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,953
He's probably got, like,
Derz and Big Stan with him.

124
00:07:44,356 --> 00:07:46,497
10-13 back in action, right?

125
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:50,100
- What you think he's doing?
- Setting up an extraction squad.

126
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,811
Stay sharp
and keep an eye on the signal.

127
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,612
Cap, there's someone here to see you.

128
00:07:56,734 --> 00:08:00,330
I told him you were busy, but
he just wouldn't take no for an answer.

129
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,856
Mr. Sabian,
you here with another revelation?

130
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:08,699
Hey, that's not fair.
I'm here because my son isn't free yet.

131
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:11,902
I'm sorry, Mr. Sabian.

132
00:08:12,403 --> 00:08:15,038
We're doing what we can
to get your boy out of the bank.

133
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:19,577
You know,
I buried my wife ten years ago.

134
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,910
And for ten years,
it's been me and my son.

135
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:24,909
And these last nights...

136
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:28,882
these last nights've been the only ones
that we've been away from each other.

137
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,344
What I'm trying to say is
I'm not me without him.

138
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,178
I'm just not right.

139
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:38,163
We fight a lot, we bicker.
But he's all I got.

140
00:08:38,745 --> 00:08:40,839
He's all I got, and if... if...

141
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:44,125
If something happens to him, I don't...

142
00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:46,022
know what I'm gonna do.

143
00:08:48,764 --> 00:08:50,342
We're doing what we can.

144
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:53,194
- I give you my word.
- I trust you, captain.

145
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:55,529
I just don't trust
those bastards in there.

146
00:08:57,225 --> 00:08:58,615
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

147
00:09:06,777 --> 00:09:07,976
Call our boys.

148
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:11,126
Let's bring in Mr. Wolf's visitor.

149
00:09:14,076 --> 00:09:18,507
All right, remember. When we move,
you go for their adam's apple, or balls.

150
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,717
Throat or scrote.

151
00:09:20,957 --> 00:09:22,677
Keep squeezing till the screaming stops.

152
00:09:23,923 --> 00:09:25,137
Heads up, Wolf's coming.

153
00:09:33,035 --> 00:09:34,039
Cap.

154
00:09:35,053 --> 00:09:37,495
- What is it, Tonray?
- There's someone here to see you.

155
00:09:37,617 --> 00:09:38,828
Who is it, Tonray?

156
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,950
It's me, smartass.

157
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,091
You ready for your surprise?

158
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:00,333
What is that you're sketching?

159
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,710
It's the creepy mes.

160
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,778
The creepy mes?
What is that?

161
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:07,380
It's a comic I've been working on.

162
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:12,009
See, at the moment every human is born

163
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:15,501
his or her creepy me
is born across the globe.

164
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,369
And it's pure evil.

165
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:21,481
And it's the creepy me's mission
to find the original

166
00:10:22,392 --> 00:10:24,157
and to take over his life

167
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:27,847
and do as much evil as possible.

168
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:31,208
Some of our lives

169
00:10:31,837 --> 00:10:33,941
have already been taken over.

170
00:10:34,664 --> 00:10:35,668
Except...

171
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,323
well, except, no one knows it yet.

172
00:10:46,101 --> 00:10:47,497
We should get going.

173
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,654
- Tonray?
- Captain.

174
00:11:19,215 --> 00:11:20,659
- Sorry for that.
- It's okay.

175
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:25,692
- Here you go.
- So...

176
00:11:26,406 --> 00:11:27,947
this is my surprise, huh?

177
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,740
No, that's not it.

178
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,444
It's okay.
I could use a shave.

179
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:36,117
I mean, it's been a few days here.
And a change of clothes is good.

180
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,381
Did you bring one for yourself?

181
00:11:38,503 --> 00:11:39,623
- What?
- Maybe that

182
00:11:39,863 --> 00:11:42,375
and the wig.
That black wig is

183
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:44,587
- so beautiful.
- Yeah, I know.

184
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:45,836
When you get home.

185
00:11:46,784 --> 00:11:48,653
When I get home...
Okay.

186
00:11:52,176 --> 00:11:53,301
What's wrong?

187
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:58,543
I know I gave you a lot of crap
about missing the doctor's appointment,

188
00:11:58,665 --> 00:12:00,252
but it wasn't really about that.

189
00:12:00,374 --> 00:12:03,517
It was about our future, and what you'd
be okay missing when we become three.

190
00:12:03,912 --> 00:12:05,100
- Right.
- We can talk

191
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:07,355
about that later.
And I won't project now.

192
00:12:08,257 --> 00:12:10,656
Just right now
I want you to see something.

193
00:12:11,342 --> 00:12:12,342
Okay.

194
00:12:33,092 --> 00:12:34,460
It's a sonogram.

195
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:36,100
Is this our baby?

196
00:12:37,768 --> 00:12:39,918
Oh, my goodness.
It's so beautiful.

197
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,580
It's a boy.

198
00:12:45,434 --> 00:12:47,053
Look at his little hands.

199
00:12:47,554 --> 00:12:48,862
He's so great.

200
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,305
I'm so sorry I didn't make
the appointment. I promise you

201
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:54,810
I will never, ever, ever
miss another appointment ever

202
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,283
as long he's around ever.

203
00:12:56,403 --> 00:12:57,411
Be careful.

204
00:12:57,795 --> 00:12:58,840
I will.

205
00:13:04,771 --> 00:13:06,873
- It's busy in here.
- Yeah, it's visiting day.

206
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:09,437
All right, I'll see you.
Could you walk her out, please?

207
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:11,287
- Thank you.
- Bye, baby.

208
00:13:11,822 --> 00:13:14,618
Captain, this is Corporal Leon Halsey.

209
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,062
He was a part
of Sergeant Mendez's platoon.

210
00:13:17,216 --> 00:13:18,808
He'd like to talk to us.

211
00:13:21,098 --> 00:13:22,708
Great.
Come on in, let's talk.

212
00:13:28,452 --> 00:13:30,327
Could you give us any insight

213
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:33,781
into the circumstances surrounding
Sergeant Mendez's court-martial?

214
00:13:34,124 --> 00:13:35,228
Sarge had an instinct

215
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,253
that there was a bomb in the buildings
we were ordered to infiltrate.

216
00:13:38,374 --> 00:13:40,347
He went head-to-head
with every superior.

217
00:13:40,966 --> 00:13:42,641
The ballsiest thing I've ever seen.

218
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:44,684
He saved all of our lives.

219
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:46,144
So suffice it to say

220
00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:48,834
that his men are fiercely loyal to him
because of that.

221
00:13:48,956 --> 00:13:50,590
We were loyal before that.

222
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:52,857
They don't have a word
for what we are now.

223
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:55,917
So what'd you come here for today,
Corporal?

224
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:58,195
- To help, like I said.
- Not to help your sergeant?

225
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:01,487
Well, that too.
I'm not gonna deny it.

226
00:14:01,718 --> 00:14:03,525
But that's a good man in that bank.

227
00:14:03,647 --> 00:14:04,659
A good man.

228
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:08,037
You and me aren't robbing banks,
and you got a worse deal than he did.

229
00:14:08,277 --> 00:14:10,372
You judge him harshly.
You don't know his reasons.

230
00:14:10,612 --> 00:14:12,624
There are no reasons.
He's a disgrace of a man

231
00:14:12,864 --> 00:14:14,579
who gives soldiers a bad name.

232
00:14:14,701 --> 00:14:17,122
He's a criminal,
and you shouldn't defend him.

233
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:20,714
Don't tell me what I should or not do.
You don't know what he has sacrificed.

234
00:14:21,075 --> 00:14:24,352
That is a good goddamn man in that bank.
They're all good men.

235
00:14:24,474 --> 00:14:26,177
And I would not be sitting here today

236
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:29,591
- if it wasn't for him.
- No need to raise our voices here.

237
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:32,662
I think we all want
to accomplish the same thing.

238
00:14:32,782 --> 00:14:36,182
And that's to get everyone out of that
bank safely, including your sergeant.

239
00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:38,426
- Excuse my outburst.
- Mine too.

240
00:14:41,406 --> 00:14:45,290
Corporal, all we need from you
is anything that you can give us

241
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,236
that can help us resolve this situation
as quickly as possible.

242
00:14:50,211 --> 00:14:52,380
Well, just that
I don't think Sergeant Mendez

243
00:14:52,502 --> 00:14:55,413
really wants to hurt
any of those people in there, all right?

244
00:14:55,553 --> 00:14:57,723
I know he's doing a bad thing,

245
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,747
okay, but he saved all of our lives.

246
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:02,999
And bad things happened to him.

247
00:15:03,657 --> 00:15:05,404
Really bad things.

248
00:15:05,554 --> 00:15:07,207
That's why he's doing this.

249
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:08,962
That's all I gotta say.

250
00:15:09,714 --> 00:15:10,982
I hope I helped.

251
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,284
Perhaps it will.

252
00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:19,988
If we have any more questions,
we'll give you a call.

253
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,430
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

254
00:15:25,469 --> 00:15:27,816
I don't trust him as far as I can spit.

255
00:15:27,957 --> 00:15:29,065
Fair enough.

256
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:32,473
We'll have one of our people tail him,
keep track his movements.

257
00:15:44,203 --> 00:15:45,443
I don't know...

258
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:49,787
I don't know really how to ask this,
so I'm just gonna do it.

259
00:15:50,494 --> 00:15:52,561
I need a pretty big favor from you.

260
00:16:01,397 --> 00:16:02,515
All right.

261
00:16:02,947 --> 00:16:04,883
So?
What now?

262
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:07,344
I, um...

263
00:16:07,782 --> 00:16:09,142
I have sort of...

264
00:16:09,943 --> 00:16:11,388
a ritual that I do.

265
00:16:11,628 --> 00:16:12,807
A ritual?

266
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:14,600
I like rituals.

267
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:18,394
But I can't leave you here alone...

268
00:16:18,634 --> 00:16:19,639
I know.

269
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:22,278
But I-i trust you.

270
00:16:22,897 --> 00:16:25,686
I don't know why,
and I know that sounds insane, but...

271
00:16:26,231 --> 00:16:27,235
I do.

272
00:16:28,494 --> 00:16:29,706
And I, um...

273
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:32,673
I thought
this might be good for you too.

274
00:16:40,106 --> 00:16:41,247
You bored?

275
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:43,181
A little.

276
00:16:47,927 --> 00:16:49,002
I have an idea.

277
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:51,922
We could play that game.

278
00:16:52,162 --> 00:16:55,800
You know, you go into the vault
and take out some stuff.

279
00:16:57,247 --> 00:16:58,469
Or better yet...

280
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,596
How about you bring me in the vault?

281
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:04,557
- You wanna go in my vault?
- Yeah.

282
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:07,601
I gotta get my mind off my dad,
you know?

283
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:11,896
You know, no one has to know
about our little date.

284
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,026
It'll be like a long bathroom break.

285
00:17:27,995 --> 00:17:29,945
Cap, he's here.

286
00:17:31,308 --> 00:17:33,497
He looks like shit.
How's he doing?

287
00:17:33,737 --> 00:17:35,579
Shaking off his last high.

288
00:17:36,183 --> 00:17:37,823
He expected us a lot sooner.

289
00:17:37,997 --> 00:17:39,766
He have anything useful for us?

290
00:17:40,056 --> 00:17:43,034
Everything he owns is in that bag.

291
00:17:43,983 --> 00:17:46,143
Goddamn heartbreaking, if you ask me.

292
00:17:47,654 --> 00:17:49,297
But I think we should use him.

293
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:51,278
May bring Wolf out of that bank.

294
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,964
Maybe.

295
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:54,880
It may backfire.

296
00:17:55,183 --> 00:17:57,321
Wolf sees his son looking like that,

297
00:17:58,485 --> 00:18:01,640
may think he failed as a dad,
think he has nothing worth living for.

298
00:18:01,838 --> 00:18:04,721
Tell you what: clean him up, keep him
close by, we'll see what happens.

299
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:05,847
Yeah.

300
00:18:11,434 --> 00:18:13,572
- How'd it go?
- I got it done.

301
00:18:13,812 --> 00:18:16,233
- Is it working?
- Running diagnostics now.

302
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,950
We'll know shortly.

303
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:23,705
I'm sorry.
I just...

304
00:18:23,945 --> 00:18:25,999
When you said he was gone,
I thought you meant

305
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,459
like he was...

306
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,100
- No, I know.
- gone.

307
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,378
I know, I...

308
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:33,637
just didn't want to get into it,
I guess.

309
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,871
But then I thought that, uh,

310
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:39,777
since you suffered
the same kind of loss, that...

311
00:18:40,612 --> 00:18:42,805
maybe it would be okay for us
to share like this.

312
00:18:43,045 --> 00:18:44,056
So you were married?

313
00:18:44,547 --> 00:18:45,674
Yeah, he's...

314
00:18:46,181 --> 00:18:47,617
he's an amazing guy.

315
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:50,964
Was an amazing guy.

316
00:18:51,557 --> 00:18:53,828
You know,
he just always went out of his way.

317
00:18:57,872 --> 00:18:59,180
It's overwhelming.

318
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,207
But my hope is that, uh,

319
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,822
that it gets easier.

320
00:19:04,151 --> 00:19:05,156
Oh, it doesn't.

321
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:09,727
You know, I start thinking
less and less of my wife.

322
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,713
And you would think
that'd be better, but...

323
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:14,539
it just makes me feel guilty.

324
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:20,741
Well,

325
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:25,673
I mean, the idea behind this is really,
really simple. It's just, uh...

326
00:19:26,746 --> 00:19:27,842
It's a way to...

327
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:31,812
remember your loved ones.
You know, releasing their energy.

328
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:36,065
All right, yeah.

329
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:39,518
Whatever feels good, right?
Go ahead, I'll give you a moment and...

330
00:19:39,873 --> 00:19:40,977
No, no, no, I...

331
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:44,791
I'd like you to stay.

332
00:20:34,495 --> 00:20:36,857
Please, Captain, just hear me out.
All right, hear me out.

333
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:38,396
Mr. Sabian, listen.

334
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,523
You can't keep coming down here, okay?
I told you we're doing all we can.

335
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:43,863
I know but listen.
I gotta get back in the bank.

336
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:46,281
Okay,
you trade me for one of the hostages.

337
00:20:46,521 --> 00:20:48,486
Or just send me back in,
but get me in the bank.

338
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:51,410
That's extremely courageous, Mr. Sabian,

339
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,080
but it's an impossibility.
You're not going back inside the bank.

340
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,998
Why?
Please, just...

341
00:20:57,238 --> 00:20:59,796
Mr. Sabian,
I know this is hard on you.

342
00:21:00,273 --> 00:21:01,937
I know that I have been hard on you.

343
00:21:02,057 --> 00:21:04,648
If you wanna speak to someone,
I'll arrange a psychologist f...

344
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:08,273
I don't need to see a goddamn
psychologist, all right? I need my son!

345
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:10,885
I need my son!
You don't understand, do you?

346
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,573
You don't understand!

347
00:21:23,475 --> 00:21:24,475
What?

348
00:21:28,222 --> 00:21:29,222
Let's use him.

349
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:30,734
You sure?

350
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:34,696
Wolf thinks he has nothing to lose.
Maybe he'll realize he does.

351
00:21:38,663 --> 00:21:39,663
He's ready.

352
00:21:51,288 --> 00:21:53,003
<i>I'd like to speak outside for a minute.</i>

353
00:21:53,722 --> 00:21:55,421
Someone here who wants to see you.

354
00:22:27,271 --> 00:22:29,616
You're such a scumbag,
you know that?

355
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:32,993
Your boy's been waiting a long time
to talk to you.

356
00:23:02,365 --> 00:23:04,103
They cleaned you up nice, man.

357
00:23:06,288 --> 00:23:08,741
Could've put
some long sleeves on you, though.

358
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,326
Look, I don't know how to do this.
I don't know how to deal with it.

359
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:19,010
This is not the time or place.
I just... I don't know.

360
00:23:19,142 --> 00:23:20,715
Beggars can't be choosers.

361
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,621
- Can't you see they're using?
- I'm using them.

362
00:23:25,861 --> 00:23:27,111
Yeah, how's that?

363
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,849
You and I both know
this could be the last time I see you.

364
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,391
And I didn't get
to say bye to mom, so...

365
00:23:37,412 --> 00:23:38,839
I don't know, I...

366
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:41,721
There's nothing I could say which
can explain what I'm doing here.

367
00:23:41,843 --> 00:23:43,344
You think I expect an explanation?

368
00:23:43,602 --> 00:23:45,253
Explanations mean shit.

369
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:50,434
I'm sorry, man.

370
00:23:51,662 --> 00:23:53,411
I'm sorry about everything.

371
00:23:53,581 --> 00:23:55,979
I'm not looking for that.
Like I said, I just need

372
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:57,855
to see you one-on-one, face-to-face.

373
00:23:57,975 --> 00:24:01,108
I know you're not looking for it, man.
Just hear me out, will you?

374
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:04,653
I messed up, big time.

375
00:24:05,447 --> 00:24:06,529
I just want you know

376
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:08,960
that I think
about you every minute, man.

377
00:24:15,592 --> 00:24:17,740
Looks like
we got something in common then.

378
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:22,777
Here.

379
00:24:23,085 --> 00:24:24,375
You should have this.

380
00:24:25,383 --> 00:24:27,301
It's the last picture
we took before you left.

381
00:24:32,495 --> 00:24:34,878
- Your mother looks...
- No, dad, don't...

382
00:24:36,294 --> 00:24:37,414
Don't say it.

383
00:24:41,322 --> 00:24:42,225
I gotta go.

384
00:24:42,465 --> 00:24:43,706
No, wait, hold on.

385
00:24:47,097 --> 00:24:48,265
I just...

386
00:24:50,463 --> 00:24:51,637
I want to...

387
00:24:55,282 --> 00:24:56,827
I want to hug you, son.

388
00:25:09,588 --> 00:25:11,400
It's okay, man.
It's okay.

389
00:25:11,865 --> 00:25:13,588
All right.
See you.

390
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,753
This is where the bank
keeps all the big cash.

391
00:25:42,224 --> 00:25:46,406
Unfortunately, me and my brothers took
all the money and left in the street.

392
00:25:47,282 --> 00:25:48,685
Well, you know that.

393
00:25:50,024 --> 00:25:52,668
As you can see
we've a lot of safe deposit boxes,

394
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,535
many of which I personally inspected,

395
00:25:54,775 --> 00:25:57,125
make sure
nobody has anything illegal in 'em.

396
00:25:59,206 --> 00:26:00,374
What's this?

397
00:26:02,456 --> 00:26:03,459
This is a picnic

398
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:06,461
for madame.
Snickers and water.

399
00:26:06,836 --> 00:26:10,006
- Best I'ld do under the circumstances.
- Well, you're very sweet.

400
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:12,383
Nobody's ever called me sweet.

401
00:26:16,918 --> 00:26:18,774
Please.
Sit.

402
00:26:26,729 --> 00:26:27,897
Please.

403
00:26:30,777 --> 00:26:32,983
I get the impression you don't...

404
00:26:33,223 --> 00:26:34,378
mind this much.

405
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:39,072
Kinda just a break from the bullshit
of real life. You know?

406
00:26:39,521 --> 00:26:41,415
When I came back from Iraq,

407
00:26:41,773 --> 00:26:45,035
I went right back to fixing cars again.
You know, like war didn't even happen.

408
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,111
I don't even know
what the hell we did over there

409
00:26:48,486 --> 00:26:50,146
except cause a whole lot of pain.

410
00:26:51,615 --> 00:26:55,544
The war was just like
a small interruption in my daily life.

411
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
I changed and...

412
00:26:57,888 --> 00:27:01,090
those guys out there, they changed,
but nothing... nothing else did.

413
00:27:02,586 --> 00:27:05,302
Anyway, I just fell back
into my old ways, you know? Just...

414
00:27:05,668 --> 00:27:09,069
drinking and
doing all kinds of stupid stuff.

415
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:11,395
Just trying to stay numb.

416
00:27:12,827 --> 00:27:13,963
Here I am.

417
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:16,312
Here we are.

418
00:27:18,233 --> 00:27:19,241
Yeah,

419
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:22,387
I just see this
as a break from the bullshit.

420
00:27:24,026 --> 00:27:25,476
You're not scared?

421
00:27:27,011 --> 00:27:29,112
You know what I'm scared of, Ashley?

422
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:31,966
I'm scared of waking up every day

423
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,535
and trying to be a real citizen.
Real human being.

424
00:27:38,775 --> 00:27:41,623
This is just... This is weird.
This is strange, 'cause...

425
00:27:42,948 --> 00:27:45,076
since I come back, I, uh...

426
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,336
I got problems talking to people,

427
00:27:47,576 --> 00:27:48,618
you know.

428
00:27:49,023 --> 00:27:50,969
Anybody, really, even my brother.

429
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:53,394
But with you, I don't know, I...

430
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:56,302
I feel like I could really talk to you.

431
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:03,445
You know, uh...

432
00:28:05,774 --> 00:28:08,812
We never got to see
each other's tattoos.

433
00:28:12,707 --> 00:28:13,715
- No.
- No.

434
00:28:13,835 --> 00:28:14,901
We did not.

435
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,863
All right, you know...
we can stay here, though, yeah, okay?

436
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:22,378
- Yeah, no, that's...
- Okay?

437
00:28:24,743 --> 00:28:27,744
Here. Just don't say anything
to anybody, okay?

438
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,358
All right?

439
00:28:40,091 --> 00:28:41,645
All right, let's man up.

440
00:28:42,248 --> 00:28:43,549
Time to go home.

441
00:28:51,644 --> 00:28:52,714
Mr. Rabbit?

442
00:29:01,337 --> 00:29:02,455
I'm sorry.

443
00:29:04,028 --> 00:29:05,150
Look, I got the shits.

444
00:29:06,354 --> 00:29:07,400
Can I go?

445
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:12,573
I got it.

446
00:29:40,837 --> 00:29:43,515
- I'm ready now.
- Me too.

447
00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:01,214
All right.

448
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:18,487
You really want to stand by
while I tear it up?

449
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,079
Come on, some privacy.

450
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,572
You are so beautiful.

451
00:31:30,449 --> 00:31:32,021
Hey, what are you doing?

452
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,278
Get in the bank.
Get into the bank!

453
00:31:46,109 --> 00:31:47,136
Don't you move.

454
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:57,406
What the hell happened?
The lights went out in the bank.

455
00:31:57,527 --> 00:31:59,299
- What?
- Get Wolf on the line, Tonray.

456
00:31:59,421 --> 00:32:01,277
- Hold on.
- Come on, come on!

457
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,300
- Get into the bank.
- Ashley, don't.

458
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,710
- I'll shoot!
- Oh, I'm so stupid!

459
00:32:14,588 --> 00:32:16,930
Don't move, don't move.
You, out.

460
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:24,773
Put your gun down.
Put it down!

461
00:32:28,307 --> 00:32:30,860
Don't do this.
They're gonna kill you, Ashley.

462
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,154
Get into the bank.

463
00:32:32,394 --> 00:32:33,655
I swear to God, I'll shoot.

464
00:32:33,895 --> 00:32:35,156
I swear.
Get into the bank.

465
00:32:35,626 --> 00:32:37,278
Come on, Wolf, come on.

466
00:32:39,066 --> 00:32:40,995
- Anything?
- Nothing.

467
00:32:53,828 --> 00:32:55,673
Leroy.
Bernard, you good?

468
00:32:56,338 --> 00:32:58,801
- I got Rabbit.
- I got Cat.

469
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:00,892
All right, that's it.
It's over.

470
00:33:12,404 --> 00:33:14,735
- Somebody make a move, brother.
- Shut up!

471
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,983
Everybody, calm down.

472
00:33:23,308 --> 00:33:25,559
I can't believe they pulled it off.
I mean, this is it.

473
00:33:25,728 --> 00:33:27,158
Jesus christ, this is it!

474
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:29,159
Open the door.
Unlock it.

475
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:31,995
All right, all right.
Do something.

476
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,650
- Look at her, she can't shoot.
- Shut the hell up.

477
00:33:37,906 --> 00:33:40,544
Grab her gun, she's not gonna shoot.
Come on, just take the gun.

478
00:33:40,784 --> 00:33:42,504
- Get the gun, man!
- Shoot him!

479
00:33:42,744 --> 00:33:43,745
Don't move.

480
00:33:46,707 --> 00:33:48,373
Just take the gun and shoot her.

481
00:33:51,668 --> 00:33:53,020
Take the gun, man!

482
00:33:53,722 --> 00:33:55,086
What are you waiting for?

483
00:33:57,082 --> 00:33:58,392
Don't let him take that gun!

484
00:34:10,873 --> 00:34:11,903
Don't move!

485
00:34:13,102 --> 00:34:14,613
Come on, just take the gun.

486
00:34:19,653 --> 00:34:20,743
Don't move.

487
00:34:22,904 --> 00:34:24,075
Please, please.

488
00:34:24,587 --> 00:34:25,622
Take her gun, man.

489
00:34:25,862 --> 00:34:26,915
Take it!

490
00:34:35,148 --> 00:34:36,465
Get away from the door!

491
00:34:36,705 --> 00:34:39,134
Or I shoot her.
Get away from the door, or she's dead.

492
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:44,721
You, I'll kill the kid.
Put the gun down.

493
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:45,931
Put it down!

494
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:54,612
You like that, uh?
You like that, little piece of shit!

495
00:35:55,462 --> 00:35:58,235
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

496
00:35:58,368 --> 00:35:59,979
I'm sorry!

497
00:36:08,192 --> 00:36:10,066
Come on, come on.

498
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,630
<i>Relax, Cap.
Just relax, all right?</i>

499
00:36:15,868 --> 00:36:17,506
Just a little problem with the wiring.

500
00:36:17,746 --> 00:36:19,299
What problem?
What wiring?

501
00:36:19,683 --> 00:36:20,964
- <i>Talk to me.</i>
- Talk?

502
00:36:21,105 --> 00:36:23,074
What am I gonna talk to you about, man?

503
00:36:23,246 --> 00:36:26,545
After what you pulled with my son,
I expected a lot more from you.

504
00:36:41,389 --> 00:36:43,197
You are very lucky people.

505
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:48,886
I'm sorry.

506
00:36:49,555 --> 00:36:50,723
I'm so sorry.

507
00:36:51,269 --> 00:36:53,035
I don't wanna hear shit from you.

508
00:36:58,794 --> 00:37:00,188
Robby rob, come on.

509
00:37:01,433 --> 00:37:02,901
Come on, buddy, let's go.

510
00:37:04,248 --> 00:37:05,943
I know, I know, I'm sorry.

511
00:37:07,357 --> 00:37:09,716
Just go sit over there on the couch.
Cat, you all right?

512
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:12,104
I'll be fine.

513
00:37:21,737 --> 00:37:22,872
Mr. Wolf!

514
00:37:23,306 --> 00:37:25,437
Let me in!
Mr. Wolf, let me in!

515
00:37:25,998 --> 00:37:27,732
Why the hell did the lights go out?

516
00:37:27,883 --> 00:37:29,949
Guys, I think you should see this.

517
00:37:35,352 --> 00:37:36,947
What the hell is he doing?

518
00:37:37,187 --> 00:37:40,616
Mr. Wolf!
Mr. Wolf, let me in.

519
00:37:46,361 --> 00:37:48,122
Please, let my son go or let me in.

520
00:37:58,704 --> 00:37:59,818
My son!

521
00:37:59,939 --> 00:38:01,492
Let him out, Mr. Wolf!

522
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,290
Please!
Please, Mr. Wolf!

523
00:38:10,256 --> 00:38:11,877
My son's in there.

524
00:38:20,853 --> 00:38:23,034
- Mr. Sabian, you got to calm down.
- Put me in jail,

525
00:38:23,274 --> 00:38:24,819
I don't care.
I gotta get in there.

526
00:38:26,727 --> 00:38:29,323
Cap, we got movement.
Someone's coming out.

527
00:38:31,404 --> 00:38:32,404
Stay here.

528
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:37,521
It's the boy.

529
00:38:53,243 --> 00:38:54,344
Go get your son.

530
00:39:19,766 --> 00:39:21,312
Thanks for coming to get me.

531
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:31,280
But the bug on the photograph has to be
within 3 feet for us to hear things.

532
00:40:31,401 --> 00:40:33,467
So what?
So keep listening, every second.

533
00:40:35,942 --> 00:40:37,420
- Cap?
- Yes.

534
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:39,087
- Leon.
- What about him?

535
00:40:39,215 --> 00:40:41,057
He kept saying "them",
"they" and "they're."

536
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:44,122
You know when he was going on

537
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:45,894
- about Mendez being a good guy?
- Yes.

538
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:47,933
He said, "They're all good guys."

539
00:40:48,055 --> 00:40:50,064
like he knew
everyone in there was from the 1013.

540
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,576
We never released that to the press.

541
00:40:52,715 --> 00:40:53,715
No, we didn't.

542
00:40:54,189 --> 00:40:56,611
Maybe Wolf was communicating with him
before we cut it off.

543
00:40:56,851 --> 00:40:58,738
Told him to come and talk shit, buy him

544
00:40:58,978 --> 00:41:01,737
- some time.
- Son of a bitch. Let's bring back Leon.

545
00:41:01,935 --> 00:41:05,533
Can't. He's gone. Son of a bitch
knew he was being followed.

546
00:41:06,776 --> 00:41:09,180
- Put out an APB on Leon.
- Okay.

547
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:16,169
<i>As we saw moments ago, the young boy,
Robby Sabian, has finally been released.</i>

548
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:18,296
<i>He's been reunited with his father,</i>

549
00:41:18,536 --> 00:41:22,632
<i>whom we saw emerge from the bank almost
36 hours ago. And as we're all aware,</i>

550
00:41:22,872 --> 00:41:25,385
<i>there are still
several hostages trapped inside</i>

551
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:28,387
<i>with family members
still awaiting their safe release.</i>

552
00:41:28,899 --> 00:41:30,557
<i>At the appropriate time...</i>

553
00:41:31,641 --> 00:41:32,840
Who the hell is that?

554
00:41:33,173 --> 00:41:35,393
Holy shit, it's Deke, man.
Yo, Deke.

555
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:37,686
- How you doin'?
<i>- How did you break through?</i>

556
00:41:37,926 --> 00:41:40,397
- They block communications all over.
- <i>Not anymore.</i>

557
00:41:40,778 --> 00:41:43,775
Sent Leon into the enemy's war room
with a scrambler, Sarge.

558
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:45,568
Little device blocks frequencies,

559
00:41:45,942 --> 00:41:48,195
com signals.
I can only use it in shot intervals

560
00:41:48,435 --> 00:41:50,661
though, so the P.P.D. doesn't flag it.

561
00:41:50,783 --> 00:41:52,270
<i>I love it, man, I love it.</i>

562
00:41:52,512 --> 00:41:53,950
Bro, it's good to hear your voice.

563
00:41:54,214 --> 00:41:57,995
Hey, I got the boys here, Sarge.
Derz, Big Stan, Leon, like I said.

564
00:41:58,377 --> 00:42:00,288
- Say hello, boys.
- Yo, Sarge!

565
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,040
He's got everybody with him.

566
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,292
- Go ahead.
- We're gonna get you home, sergeant.

567
00:42:04,537 --> 00:42:06,085
<i>I got a priority plan in place.</i>

568
00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:08,440
But I need your help.
