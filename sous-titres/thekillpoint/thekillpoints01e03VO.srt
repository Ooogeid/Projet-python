00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,385
<i>Previously on</i> the Kill Point.

2
00:00:01,507 --> 00:00:03,908
This's a bank robbery.
Follow these simple instructions,

3
00:00:04,031 --> 00:00:06,235
and we can all walk out of here,
safe and sound.

4
00:00:07,093 --> 00:00:08,410
Pull back!

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,068
This is now a hostage situation.

6
00:00:11,614 --> 00:00:13,667
Give me the wallet, throw it down.
Right there.

7
00:00:13,837 --> 00:00:15,287
- What do you have?
- Who's this?

8
00:00:15,654 --> 00:00:17,548
- Captain Horst Cali.
- I'm Wolf.

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,252
This thing ends with us free or dead.

10
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:21,977
- Chief Abrami?
- Make contact. We'll distract them.

11
00:00:24,378 --> 00:00:25,659
I want a flak jacket

12
00:00:25,828 --> 00:00:26,911
<i>for every soldier.</i>

13
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,313
And I want the son of every senator
who voted yes

14
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:30,999
to sign up for active duty.

15
00:00:31,122 --> 00:00:33,637
You know what's at stake,
and I know how to play.

16
00:00:33,762 --> 00:00:35,797
Ask another question.
That'll shatter a face.

17
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:38,490
You kill a hostage,
negotiations are over.

18
00:00:38,697 --> 00:00:41,005
Real estate magnate Alan Beck
is indeed at the scene

19
00:00:41,156 --> 00:00:43,190
and his daughter Ashley
is one of the hostages.

20
00:00:43,314 --> 00:00:44,886
She became our most valuable commodity.

21
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:46,648
Without power,
no contact with him.

22
00:00:46,968 --> 00:00:48,287
Kill the electric now!

23
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:50,933
I give you exactly one hour
to give me electricity back,

24
00:00:51,064 --> 00:00:52,675
- or I kill a hostage.
- Me and Henry

25
00:00:52,797 --> 00:00:55,321
- know we're the assassins.
- Mr. Wolf, choose me.

26
00:00:55,453 --> 00:00:56,923
Special agent Kerry Southwell

27
00:00:57,044 --> 00:01:00,124
died a couple of hours ago. We're
bringing someone in from washington.

28
00:01:00,247 --> 00:01:02,432
As of now,
you're a secondary negotiator.

29
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:04,721
Follow these instructions.
If you don't,

30
00:01:04,872 --> 00:01:07,660
your daughter and my son
aren't gonna make it alive.

31
00:01:07,782 --> 00:01:10,410
- I'm a negotiator.
- You're a secondary negotiator.

32
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,755
In consultant capacity.

33
00:01:12,878 --> 00:01:15,176
Platoon 10-13 back in action.

34
00:01:15,332 --> 00:01:17,003
Let's get our boys home.

35
00:01:17,982 --> 00:01:20,703
<i>If you're just joining us,
we're approaching 18 hours here,</i>

36
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:23,277
<i>in market square
as bank robbers continue to hold</i>

37
00:01:23,398 --> 00:01:24,971
<i>a group of hostages inside.</i>

38
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:29,217
<i>I have recently noticed a heavy
FBI presence on scene as they appear</i>

39
00:01:29,396 --> 00:01:33,088
<i>to be getting more involved after
the death of agent Kerry Southwell.</i>

40
00:01:33,314 --> 00:01:35,528
<i>Keep it here at news 14 as we continue</i>

41
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:37,289
<i>to bring you live coverage.</i>

42
00:01:54,612 --> 00:01:56,119
So let's negotiate.

43
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,719
Save me and she's free.

44
00:02:00,047 --> 00:02:01,535
All right.
Go ahead and send it.

45
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:04,577
Bet you Beck already made
the appropriate changes by now.

46
00:02:09,527 --> 00:02:10,958
What do you wanna do?

47
00:02:14,547 --> 00:02:16,619
I wanna put some heat on the FBI.

48
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:39,195
What, man?

49
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:41,041
Wh...

50
00:02:41,484 --> 00:02:43,181
What...
What did I do?

51
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:02,795
What's that, sir?

52
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:04,588
What?

53
00:03:05,903 --> 00:03:07,316
- Rabbit!
- Rabbit!

54
00:03:18,637 --> 00:03:20,191
Hey, come on, man.
Snap out of it.

55
00:03:20,323 --> 00:03:21,896
Come on.
Snap out of it, come on.

56
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,574
Look at me.
It's Jake.

57
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,250
- Mr. Pig.
- What's up?

58
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:26,691
I got it, I got it.

59
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:30,858
Episode 1x03
Transcript: swsub.com / Sync: DarKsh

60
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:42,972
You see that, Johnny Boy?

61
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:46,636
That little shake, slight tremble...

62
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:50,339
Too much sodium in the blood.

63
00:03:50,744 --> 00:03:52,600
Not enough oxygen to the brain.

64
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:57,244
Toxins, maladies, emotions...

65
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:58,762
Biology.

66
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:01,935
Two words that never stand

67
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:05,081
side by side in my world, Johnny Boy,
and that's second and chance.

68
00:04:05,486 --> 00:04:07,590
You lose balance, you lose lives.

69
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,388
And last but not least,

70
00:04:16,443 --> 00:04:17,469
hormones.

71
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:21,981
Oh, yes,

72
00:04:22,104 --> 00:04:24,289
Johnny Boy, testosterone is a killer.

73
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:28,765
One voluptuous full-moon bubble ass
on an african queen...

74
00:04:31,732 --> 00:04:33,440
can shake this entire world.

75
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:39,259
- Mike.
- Connie?

76
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,717
Collect everything we have on the HTs.

77
00:04:44,882 --> 00:04:48,235
Tonray, I need a copy of the
Sabian debrief for agent Ash, please.

78
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:50,298
I'd like
to get her up to speed immediately.

79
00:04:51,597 --> 00:04:54,272
Also get me a new set of headphones
before we talk to Wolf again.

80
00:04:54,414 --> 00:04:55,685
Ear bud or over ear?

81
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,372
So...
Five confirmed HTs,

82
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:04,387
ID'd by the two released hostages.
We're gathering intel on 'em now.

83
00:05:05,313 --> 00:05:06,452
This is the leader,

84
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:08,545
sergeant Jake Mendez,
aka Mr. Wolf.

85
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:10,974
He's calling the shots inside,
the one I've talked to.

86
00:05:11,425 --> 00:05:13,027
We have a psych profile on him yet?

87
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:16,211
We do.
However, it's all over the map.

88
00:05:16,737 --> 00:05:18,499
He's a psychopath and a saint.

89
00:05:18,621 --> 00:05:21,814
His profile, his military file tell me
nothing about the man I'm dealing with.

90
00:05:22,386 --> 00:05:24,272
I should talk to him cold.
No introductions.

91
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,231
That may throw things off-kilter.

92
00:05:26,354 --> 00:05:28,144
It's okay.
I don't wanna give him options.

93
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:31,044
- Let's keep him guessing.
- Fine. Let's see how he responds.

94
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:32,235
Super.

95
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:34,703
I think we're in pretty good shape here.

96
00:05:35,674 --> 00:05:38,857
Now, I may lean on you a bit.
Especially in the next few hours.

97
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,223
Lean all you want.

98
00:05:40,346 --> 00:05:43,416
I intend to be here until everyone
is out of that bank safely.

99
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:46,655
Captain Cali, this is...

100
00:05:46,787 --> 00:05:47,890
an awkward situation.

101
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,877
You're one of the best at what you do,

102
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:51,779
and if I were in your shoes,
I'd be pissed.

103
00:05:51,948 --> 00:05:54,717
I'm here to resolve this as quickly
as possible, and I'm really glad

104
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,709
you're here to help me,
but I don't wanna

105
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:58,833
have to explain the way I do things.

106
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:04,268
Agent Ash...
I think it's important

107
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:06,576
to tell you
that Wolf can be talked down.

108
00:06:07,123 --> 00:06:08,724
If we keep humanizing the hostages,

109
00:06:08,884 --> 00:06:12,341
preying on his emotions, I really
believe we can extract one at a time.

110
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:14,762
I'll keep that in mind,
Captain, thank you.

111
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:16,975
I'm gonna schedule
a meeting with my team,

112
00:06:17,097 --> 00:06:18,755
and then we'll make the call to... Wolf.

113
00:06:20,984 --> 00:06:23,056
And I talked to my guys at green tree.

114
00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:26,136
They were able to track down
Teddy Sabian boy's teacher.

115
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:29,599
Turns out the kid's a genius.
Some sort of computer prodigy.

116
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:39,200
You're getting my bill
when we get out of here.

117
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:46,052
A new tattoo.

118
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:51,347
Wow, look at that. You should have
never gone into the military, man.

119
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:54,131
You should have gone to art school.
Look at this shit.

120
00:06:54,272 --> 00:06:55,280
It's good.

121
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:59,698
Don't look at me that way, man.

122
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:02,157
All right?
It makes me feel pathetic.

123
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,665
It's infected.

124
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:16,696
Goddamn FBI.

125
00:07:16,818 --> 00:07:18,118
It doesn't surprise me.

126
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:19,540
Mayor, media, Beck.

127
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:20,954
Lethal combination.

128
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,771
A lot of bureaucratic bullshit.

129
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:24,557
Look at that ass.

130
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:27,183
What?
What's wrong with her ass?

131
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,123
She's got a man's ass!

132
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:32,674
I bet every nickel I've got,

133
00:07:32,797 --> 00:07:34,461
she was a shit's toss from being a man.

134
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,877
God was indecisive when he made her.
Flip-flopping...

135
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:40,592
At the last second he just said,

136
00:07:40,713 --> 00:07:43,559
"Nah, give her some jugs,
made too many boys today."

137
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,929
Why the hell would Wolf release him?

138
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:52,038
Why not a child?
Why not a woman?

139
00:07:52,444 --> 00:07:53,687
Yeah, I hear you.

140
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:56,155
He gains nothing making that move.

141
00:07:56,682 --> 00:07:57,682
Or does he?

142
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,462
He holds the man's son.
He can hold that over his head.

143
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:03,808
But why would he need leverage
on Teddy Sabian?

144
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:05,990
Because his son is a computer whiz.

145
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:09,250
Tonray...

146
00:08:10,927 --> 00:08:13,394
Find out if
our communication block is still up.

147
00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:14,711
Got it.

148
00:08:15,853 --> 00:08:17,492
You think he's using that?

149
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:19,913
I don't know.

150
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:25,964
Cops on site?

151
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,270
South side, couple dozen,
not counting SWAT in the pit,

152
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,785
and many more
in the surrounding buildings.

153
00:08:31,974 --> 00:08:33,942
- Entry points?
- The obvious ones are locked.

154
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:36,579
There's a half dozen sewer drops,
all in the line of sight.

155
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:38,322
Derz, keep working schematics.

156
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:41,769
Meantime, let's spread out,
find a nice high vantage, set up shop.

157
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:44,063
Need a direct line

158
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:46,503
into the bank,
but we need to drop a little...

159
00:08:46,644 --> 00:08:47,982
out of the mix.

160
00:08:55,322 --> 00:08:56,449
Watch mine.

161
00:09:02,858 --> 00:09:03,998
I don't like rabbits.

162
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:06,237
Ever since I was a kid.

163
00:09:07,653 --> 00:09:10,190
I didn't like the easter bunny.
I hated Bugs Bunny.

164
00:09:10,535 --> 00:09:13,237
I thought he was queer.
No offense, Bernard.

165
00:09:14,508 --> 00:09:19,481
Or that energizer bunny, beating
that shitty bass drum over and over.

166
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:22,335
I add that Rabbit to my expanding list.

167
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:23,946
I guarantee you...

168
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,326
That whacked Rabbit bastard is gonna
snap again and again,

169
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:29,663
until one of us is done.

170
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:31,089
What can we do?

171
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,392
We need to talk
to that lawyer about his gun.

172
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:45,859
And then we need to talk to her.

173
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:22,573
I like watching you sleep.

174
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:24,932
You say that to all the girls?

175
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:40,075
- You get anything yet, kid?
- No, nothing yet.

176
00:10:41,077 --> 00:10:42,077
What's wrong?

177
00:10:42,637 --> 00:10:43,647
It's my birthday.

178
00:10:45,877 --> 00:10:48,260
Don't tell me
you were having a birthday party today.

179
00:10:48,747 --> 00:10:50,696
- Yeah.
- Oh, man, I'm sorry.

180
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:52,417
I'm sorry I can't let you go out, man.

181
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:54,820
I'm sorry you're gonna have
to miss the party. I can't.

182
00:10:54,943 --> 00:10:55,946
It's okay.

183
00:10:56,763 --> 00:10:58,325
It was gonna be lame anyway.

184
00:10:58,777 --> 00:11:01,405
Now, don't put yourself down like that.
Don't do that, man.

185
00:11:01,532 --> 00:11:03,487
My dad's throwing me a pool party, okay?

186
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:07,132
Now, how we even have a pool
in the first place is a mystery.

187
00:11:07,717 --> 00:11:10,278
It's one of those,
like, cheap aboveground pools.

188
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,406
Yeah.

189
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,311
We kind of float around like bobbers.

190
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:16,777
Plus I've been a "shirtie" forever.

191
00:11:17,034 --> 00:11:20,217
- What's that?
- You know, I wear my shirt in the pool.

192
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:21,684
To...

193
00:11:21,894 --> 00:11:23,137
cover...

194
00:11:24,254 --> 00:11:25,262
My man cans.

195
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:30,820
- This kid's crazy.
- Yeah, I've got four friends too,

196
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,600
and they're all dudes.

197
00:11:33,703 --> 00:11:37,451
I'm having a female free birthday party,
and that's just really depressing.

198
00:11:37,904 --> 00:11:39,741
It is depressing man,
but you know what?

199
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:41,645
I was a shirtie too.

200
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,876
I wore my t-shirt into the pool
just like you.

201
00:11:43,998 --> 00:11:45,091
Yeah, right.

202
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:47,069
I swear to God.
I was a tubby kid. Husky.

203
00:11:47,276 --> 00:11:49,688
And I had it worse than you, man.
I had a shitty hair cut,

204
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,421
I had coke bottle glasses.

205
00:11:51,572 --> 00:11:52,579
It sucks.

206
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:53,945
Yeah, it sucked.

207
00:12:06,471 --> 00:12:08,101
What kind of cake do you want?

208
00:12:08,948 --> 00:12:10,371
- Cake?
- Yeah.

209
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,420
I don't know.

210
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:14,732
Doesn't really matter.
I like all kinds.

211
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,251
You know, actually,

212
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:20,802
I don't really like meringue.
I'm not exactly sure what that is.

213
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:24,080
Nobody does.
Hey, cap, I want a cake ASAP.

214
00:12:24,516 --> 00:12:26,751
Game's changed a bit, sergeant Mendez.

215
00:12:27,488 --> 00:12:29,391
<i>Very interesting.
Who may I ask is calling?</i>

216
00:12:29,721 --> 00:12:31,322
This is agent Ash with the FBI.

217
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:33,290
<i>You're gonna be speaking to me
from now on.</i>

218
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:35,400
<i>- How do you do?</i>
- I do good.

219
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:37,086
I do real good, but you know what?

220
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:39,893
I'm not good at breaking in new shoes,
if you get my meaning.

221
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:43,291
<i>It's too uncomfortable,
the chafing, the blisters are a bitch,</i>

222
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:46,258
- besides, I don't wear heels, get it?
<i>- Noted.</i>

223
00:12:46,545 --> 00:12:49,635
But we find ourselves in a situation
where you don't have very many choices.

224
00:12:49,757 --> 00:12:50,887
Where's the other guy?

225
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:52,536
<i>We had an understanding, a rapport.</i>

226
00:12:52,668 --> 00:12:53,967
<i>Can I get him back, please?</i>

227
00:12:54,109 --> 00:12:55,785
- Not possible.
<i>- In these circumstances</i>

228
00:12:55,936 --> 00:12:57,923
anything is possible, where is he?

229
00:12:58,225 --> 00:12:59,232
Reassigned.

230
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,839
I'm here to help you, sergeant Mendez.
I really am.

231
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,844
You wanna help me?
Get me a goddamn cake.

232
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,162
<i>That's not the way</i>

233
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:08,378
this is gonna work.

234
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:11,400
<i>You know what's on people's minds
when they yell "surprise" </i>

235
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:12,975
at your 40th birthday, or...

236
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:16,129
Or you're giving your wedding vows,
you know what people are thinking?

237
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:19,737
They think, "How good is that cake?
And how big a piece am I gonna get?"

238
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,687
<i>That's what they're thinking.</i>

239
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:24,488
<i>You dress up, bring a gift,
and you know what you end up with?</i>

240
00:13:24,612 --> 00:13:27,553
You end up with an empty plate,
and a fork full of frosting.

241
00:13:27,847 --> 00:13:30,180
This is a waste of time, sergeant.
Now you listen to me.

242
00:13:30,312 --> 00:13:31,320
<i>Ash, Ash,</i>

243
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:34,108
<i>I want a cake, okay?
A big-ass cake, all right?</i>

244
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:36,482
I want healthy portions for everybody.

245
00:13:36,704 --> 00:13:38,667
Marble, chocolate, I don't care.

246
00:13:39,392 --> 00:13:41,003
- Are you done?
<i>- Yeah, for now.</i>

247
00:13:41,143 --> 00:13:42,548
'Cause I think I made my point.

248
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,682
Good.

249
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:46,892
Because captain Cali and I
operate a little bit differently.

250
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:50,235
You see, I'm not a DJ.
I don't take requests.

251
00:13:50,611 --> 00:13:54,048
<i>And your demands mean nothing to me.
If I wanna give you something,</i>

252
00:13:54,172 --> 00:13:57,863
it'll be on my terms, and now I want you
to send Ashley Beck out the front door.

253
00:13:58,494 --> 00:14:00,190
If you don't, all negotiations

254
00:14:00,312 --> 00:14:02,422
<i>stop immediately.
I'm going to take away your food</i>

255
00:14:02,554 --> 00:14:05,804
and everything else that makes you
comfortable. Are we clear on this?

256
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:09,084
Did I say no meringue?
If I didn't, I don't want come.

257
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,742
<i>If I see meringue,
I'm sending it back to the baker.</i>

258
00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:17,237
That was bitchy.

259
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,166
What was that?

260
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:22,502
I was taking his blue chip away.
Getting the powe...

261
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,056
You just flagged his blue chip.

262
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:27,173
You think he's gonna send Ashley Beck?
If he wants a cake,

263
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:29,123
- give him a cake!
- Captain Cali,

264
00:14:29,274 --> 00:14:32,222
under no circumstances
does the FBI negotiate with terrorists.

265
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:35,819
You never negotiate?
Then why are we here?

266
00:14:36,921 --> 00:14:38,623
Can I talk to you, please?

267
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:44,712
You know, I was really trying to avoid
the whole obvious butting of heads thing

268
00:14:44,873 --> 00:14:46,323
but for all intensive purposes,

269
00:14:46,446 --> 00:14:50,005
your job here is done,
and regardless of what you think of me,

270
00:14:50,128 --> 00:14:52,765
I know men like Mendez.
He thrives in climatic situations.

271
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:56,495
You take away his power, you highlight
his weaknesses. That's what you do.

272
00:14:56,617 --> 00:14:59,019
You didn't do that.
In fact, you did the opposite of that.

273
00:14:59,283 --> 00:15:00,790
I didn't campaign for this job.

274
00:15:01,111 --> 00:15:03,475
I was requested.
So let me do what I do,

275
00:15:03,597 --> 00:15:05,867
cause I am very good at it.
We done?

276
00:15:10,397 --> 00:15:11,565
Actually we're not.

277
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,815
First of all, there's nothing intensive
about a purpose.

278
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:17,697
I also think
you meant to say "climactic,"

279
00:15:18,372 --> 00:15:22,189
unless of course, you think Mr. Wolf
thrives in meteorological situations,

280
00:15:22,652 --> 00:15:25,690
in which case, "climatic" would be
an appropriate choice of words.

281
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:29,281
And this is what you care about,
my grammar?

282
00:15:29,677 --> 00:15:33,379
I'm talking about the fact
that I am not buying your bullshit.

283
00:15:34,486 --> 00:15:37,396
So now,
for all intents and purposes,

284
00:15:37,755 --> 00:15:38,903
we're done.

285
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:53,269
Tonray said
the communication block is fine.

286
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:54,653
Good.

287
00:15:55,707 --> 00:15:56,707
But that...

288
00:15:57,533 --> 00:15:59,295
- That is not good.
- No.

289
00:16:03,665 --> 00:16:04,673
Tonray.

290
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,110
Get me a pack of cigarettes
and a lighter, please.

291
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:10,832
- I wanna talk to Teddy Sabian.
- Why?

292
00:16:11,058 --> 00:16:14,233
We can't communicate with Wolf,
but we can continue to work him.

293
00:16:14,363 --> 00:16:16,850
Something's up with Sabian.
I wanna find out what it is.

294
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:45,327
When Ashley was a little girl,

295
00:16:45,454 --> 00:16:48,625
she used to come and jump on the bed
until Nancy and I woke up.

296
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,366
I must have told her
100 times to be careful.

297
00:16:51,492 --> 00:16:53,396
You'd think she'd listen to me.

298
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:55,723
So she ran in one day,

299
00:16:56,363 --> 00:16:58,248
and she starts jumping
on the bed as usual.

300
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,527
The ceiling fan catches her
right in the back of the head.

301
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:06,080
I mean, she was all right, she just got
a couple of stitches, that's all.

302
00:17:07,385 --> 00:17:09,038
Couple of days go by,

303
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,751
she comes back into the room again,
she jumps up on the bed

304
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,836
and she says to me, "Daddy...

305
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,930
"You'd better take
that ceiling fan down."

306
00:17:21,268 --> 00:17:22,610
That's my daughter.

307
00:17:28,095 --> 00:17:29,213
Derz, Stan, we're in.

308
00:17:29,818 --> 00:17:30,832
What's your 20?

309
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:35,006
Just wrapping up down here.
How's that new office space?

310
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:37,250
<i>Safe and sound, baby.</i>

311
00:17:37,837 --> 00:17:39,454
We have a very nice view.

312
00:17:45,191 --> 00:17:48,346
And if she stays in there too long,
she's gonna try something.

313
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:51,285
I want you
to get me clearance into command.

314
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,969
I want to get in there first hand,
and see how the FBI

315
00:17:54,092 --> 00:17:55,620
is playing this thing.

316
00:17:57,495 --> 00:17:58,495
Okay.

317
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:02,124
But, Alan...

318
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:07,173
I think it's time
we took matters into our own hands.

319
00:18:07,731 --> 00:18:09,308
Let's handle it how we know how.

320
00:18:13,185 --> 00:18:14,185
Okay.

321
00:18:15,993 --> 00:18:17,059
Do it.

322
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:27,082
I can't believe
we got taken off the perimeter.

323
00:18:27,214 --> 00:18:29,787
We gotta talk to Lou.
We gotta get back into the pit.

324
00:18:30,434 --> 00:18:33,382
The only interesting thing to do
with this post is scratch my rocks.

325
00:18:33,702 --> 00:18:35,092
There's nothing more satisfying

326
00:18:35,354 --> 00:18:37,448
than isolating
that itch between your fingers

327
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,420
and just giving it
the old pinch and roll.

328
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,713
That's dangerous.

329
00:18:40,844 --> 00:18:42,615
I drew blood once using that technique.

330
00:18:43,348 --> 00:18:45,648
Gotta try the "flip and drag" sometime.

331
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:47,930
Utilize the back of the nail.

332
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:50,005
Gently brush the back.

333
00:18:50,944 --> 00:18:52,747
This won't take long, Mr. Sabian.

334
00:18:52,871 --> 00:18:55,301
We forgot
to cross a few t's, dot some "i"s.

335
00:18:58,089 --> 00:19:00,904
Where are we?
I mean, what are we doing up here?

336
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:07,791
This is where I like to come,
clear my head.

337
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:10,054
Where I sit with my thoughts.

338
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:13,941
Try to figure out how I'm gonna get
your son out of that bank down there.

339
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:18,067
You know what I need from you

340
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,830
in order to accomplish that.

341
00:19:22,122 --> 00:19:23,964
I need you to trust me, Teddy.

342
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:26,114
It's not an easy thing, trust.

343
00:19:26,762 --> 00:19:28,029
It's one of those...

344
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,148
intangibles in life
that so often betrays us.

345
00:19:33,182 --> 00:19:35,125
I won't betray your trust, Teddy.

346
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,797
I'm gonna get your son
out of that bank safely.

347
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:40,865
I don't give my word often.

348
00:19:43,341 --> 00:19:45,046
But I'm giving it to you now.

349
00:19:46,842 --> 00:19:48,842
All I need is for you to trust me.

350
00:20:07,431 --> 00:20:08,502
Connie.

351
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,254
I've asked Tonray twice now
for intel updates.

352
00:20:15,376 --> 00:20:16,908
He's falling way behind.

353
00:20:17,998 --> 00:20:21,088
Could you please
deliver this message to him?

354
00:20:29,903 --> 00:20:31,434
You can come this way.

355
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:06,498
You know you make me nervous
when you do that thing with your face.

356
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,789
What was that about?

357
00:21:08,451 --> 00:21:09,451
Alan Beck.

358
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:11,686
Despite everything that's going on,

359
00:21:11,815 --> 00:21:14,703
he takes the time to shake every hand
in this building, except for one:

360
00:21:15,124 --> 00:21:17,075
Teddy Sabian,
that's right, why?

361
00:21:17,701 --> 00:21:20,758
I'll tell you why. Cause
that little farce of an introduction,

362
00:21:21,252 --> 00:21:23,176
that wasn't their first meeting.

363
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,756
What are they doing?
What are they doing?

364
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:02,357
Loudspeakers, Cap.
FBI ordered them.

365
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:03,737
That wasn't my call.

366
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:07,623
You may wanna go over there,
talk to Ash about it.

367
00:22:07,783 --> 00:22:08,994
I'm gonna do just that.

368
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:11,191
Excuse me.

369
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:12,722
What's with the sound system?

370
00:22:12,857 --> 00:22:16,161
It's becoming very time-consuming having
to explain myself to the consultant.

371
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:18,338
- Careful, Cali.
- I'm being careful, sir,

372
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,316
just curious. So what?
You're gonna make some noise?

373
00:22:21,766 --> 00:22:23,541
That's your plan to save lives?
Mr. Beck,

374
00:22:23,663 --> 00:22:26,057
you may wanna pay attention,
you've a lot at stake here.

375
00:22:26,189 --> 00:22:28,428
- Cali, I gave you fair warning.
- Duly noted, sir.

376
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:30,487
Yes, we're gonna make
some noise, Captain.

377
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:34,424
I also ordered the A/C to be up,
it's gonna be 30 degrees in that bank.

378
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:36,390
Psychological warfare, heard of it?

379
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:40,045
They spent winters in Fallujah
with bombs going off as they slept.

380
00:22:40,165 --> 00:22:42,528
That's noise. That's cold.
What do you think?

381
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:44,810
Than playing music over a stereo system

382
00:22:44,932 --> 00:22:47,045
and turn on a fan
is gonna break these guys down?

383
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,636
- That's it? Try country music.
- We need to talk.

384
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,251
Cause that's enough to make me

385
00:22:51,373 --> 00:22:53,100
wanna blow my brain
over the sidewalk.

386
00:22:53,222 --> 00:22:55,381
- What?!
- Stop talking for once, and listen.

387
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,782
You said it, bureaucratic bullshit's
why you're in this spot.

388
00:22:58,902 --> 00:22:59,903
Well, this bullshit

389
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:02,808
may be more dangerous than them HTs.
But you want them hostages out?

390
00:23:03,221 --> 00:23:04,874
You need to swallow your pride

391
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,987
- and play this one straight.
- Okay.

392
00:23:07,109 --> 00:23:08,424
Don't even come back at me.

393
00:23:09,281 --> 00:23:10,993
You are not in a position to buck

394
00:23:11,114 --> 00:23:14,644
the system right now,
because it is bucking you back.

395
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:17,187
Now, come on.

396
00:23:20,011 --> 00:23:21,026
Okay.

397
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,283
Leroy.
It's time to talk.

398
00:24:02,597 --> 00:24:04,302
- About what?
- Your gun.

399
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,711
If we can get the one you stashed,

400
00:24:07,832 --> 00:24:11,295
and then get our hands on his gun,
we got this side of the bank covered.

401
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:13,781
How're you gonna get it?

402
00:24:14,335 --> 00:24:16,410
I've worked the electrical
in the bank this week.

403
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:19,067
There's a spot in the men's bathroom
that I can get to.

404
00:24:19,433 --> 00:24:21,706
Send this place in the black
for as long as we need.

405
00:24:23,856 --> 00:24:26,964
Okay, so... We got this side covered.
But what about over there?

406
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:30,129
We hire the rich kid.

407
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,150
She can get piggy under her thumb.

408
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,295
Hopefully she's telepathic.

409
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:40,294
I got the way to communicate with her.

410
00:24:49,265 --> 00:24:51,777
How did they get your dad's email?
Is he gonna get you out?

411
00:24:52,031 --> 00:24:54,388
They're not gonna let me go.
Relax.

412
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:02,461
Are you ladies talking about me?

413
00:25:03,918 --> 00:25:05,898
And what if we were, Mister Pig?

414
00:25:06,892 --> 00:25:07,892
I don't know.

415
00:25:09,026 --> 00:25:11,242
Mister Piggy, do me a favor.
Get the manager guy.

416
00:25:11,656 --> 00:25:14,582
Bring him over here to the thermostat
on the double, thank you.

417
00:25:14,886 --> 00:25:15,956
Come on, come on.

418
00:25:16,172 --> 00:25:19,067
FBI broad
must have jacked up the A/C in here.

419
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,050
- Any response yet?
- No, nothing yet, man.

420
00:25:29,171 --> 00:25:30,589
What do you think's going on?

421
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,307
- How we send a message?
- You wanna

422
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:34,457
- write one?
- Yeah. Can you set it up?

423
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:36,326
Go ahead.

424
00:25:37,856 --> 00:25:40,225
It's up as high as it'll go.
The compressor's up on the...

425
00:25:40,345 --> 00:25:42,927
Do I want a conversation with you?
Just fix it.

426
00:25:44,551 --> 00:25:46,363
Come on.
It's your bank, Lou.

427
00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:51,333
Jesus, what is wrong with you?

428
00:25:51,821 --> 00:25:55,080
Hey mister Wolf, you don't have to fight
the cops about my cake, dude.

429
00:25:55,202 --> 00:25:57,155
- You've enough on your plate, man.
- Hey, man.

430
00:25:57,315 --> 00:26:00,319
If I say I'm gonna make something
happen, I make it happen, all right?

431
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,385
- Let's just see if...
- Sarge?

432
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,880
I gotta ask you,
what is it with this cake thing?

433
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,194
- I got my reasons, man.
- But sergeant, we shouldn't be playing

434
00:26:10,326 --> 00:26:12,270
- with the FBI...
- I know what I'm doing, man.

435
00:26:12,392 --> 00:26:14,223
What are you gonna question me for?

436
00:26:36,727 --> 00:26:38,555
- Where's Ashley Beck, sergeant?
<i>- What?</i>

437
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:41,053
Candy, I can't hear you.
I'm in this freakin' club.

438
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:43,766
<i>Hey, look.
I'm looking for a post-op tranny.</i>

439
00:26:44,283 --> 00:26:46,555
<i>The bigger, the better, baby.
I'm looking</i>

440
00:26:46,686 --> 00:26:49,081
for soft in the south,
and chiseled on top, okay?

441
00:26:49,203 --> 00:26:51,776
Square jaw,
adam's apple is all good, baby.

442
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,871
<i>But if I see any sign of a johnny,
I ship the whore back to you</i>

443
00:26:54,994 --> 00:26:56,411
in a pine box, you got that?

444
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,327
- Sergeant, this isn't a game.
<i>- Oh, shit.</i>

445
00:26:58,496 --> 00:27:01,443
I thought you were Candy,
my he-whore merchant, sorry.

446
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:14,137
- Yeah.
- Oye,

447
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,668
<i>mira papi chulo</i>, I want three pies
on the fly, mad fast. You got that?

448
00:27:17,987 --> 00:27:20,250
<i>One traditional,
one white with asparagus.</i>

449
00:27:20,476 --> 00:27:22,974
<i>Yeah, and throw in the clam
with the, uh, garlic.</i>

450
00:27:23,115 --> 00:27:24,936
<i>I know, I'm gonna get ass flames, but</i>

451
00:27:25,058 --> 00:27:26,270
it's good going down, uh?

452
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,901
Oh, hey, sorry.
Wrong number.

453
00:27:40,614 --> 00:27:41,619
Kill the sound.

454
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:46,858
I'll be right back.

455
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,539
Where are you going?

456
00:28:23,773 --> 00:28:25,238
Our guy is in place.

457
00:28:47,663 --> 00:28:49,982
It's on! It's on!
He took the bait!

458
00:28:50,733 --> 00:28:53,250
Come on, come on.
Get up, queen bee, come on.

459
00:28:54,555 --> 00:28:56,043
Time to earn your keep.

460
00:28:57,954 --> 00:28:59,925
Hold it right there, sweetie pie.

461
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,691
- Ashley Beck, sergeant.
<i>- Keep your eye on the door.</i>

462
00:29:11,818 --> 00:29:12,846
We're coming out.

463
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:16,968
Let's go.

464
00:29:28,282 --> 00:29:30,770
All teams ready.
Wolf's coming out of the bank.

465
00:29:35,878 --> 00:29:38,920
All right, line up and hold.
A low show and tell.

466
00:29:39,164 --> 00:29:40,318
Breathe easy.

467
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:56,490
Who's this guy?

468
00:30:08,885 --> 00:30:11,260
Fellows, we've a problem.
Sniper on a rooftop.

469
00:30:11,532 --> 00:30:12,941
<i>He's not a cop.
This is a pro.</i>

470
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:14,753
Shit. Where?
Where is he?

471
00:30:17,617 --> 00:30:19,788
<i>2282, Penn ave.
Move. Move!</i>

472
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:29,730
Shit.

473
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,689
Sarge is outside the bank.

474
00:30:34,382 --> 00:30:36,264
What the hell is this man doing?

475
00:31:23,153 --> 00:31:24,170
Run, baby.

476
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:25,667
Come on.

477
00:31:28,907 --> 00:31:30,169
Who's firing?

478
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:33,296
They shot me!

479
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:34,619
Run, baby.

480
00:31:35,397 --> 00:31:36,414
Run.

481
00:31:37,366 --> 00:31:38,420
Please stop!

482
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:40,427
Stop, please!

483
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:45,928
Jesus Christ!
They shot me!

484
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,537
Please!

485
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:55,184
Please!

486
00:31:56,334 --> 00:31:57,738
Come on, boys.
Get him.

487
00:32:13,738 --> 00:32:15,838
The sniper's...
incapacitated.

488
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:20,181
Something funky going on here.

489
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:23,535
They don't give a shit
about the rest of us!

490
00:32:23,752 --> 00:32:25,442
Another inch and i'm dead.

491
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:26,916
An inch!

492
00:32:27,101 --> 00:32:28,292
That was not cool.

493
00:32:29,243 --> 00:32:31,561
- We could've been killed.
- I'm sorry, come on.

494
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,169
I'm not gonna let you get hurt,
or let anything happen to you.

495
00:32:38,107 --> 00:32:40,876
- I need confirmation on all points.
- Who fired?

496
00:32:40,998 --> 00:32:43,334
We're gathering that information.
But it wasn't my team.

497
00:32:43,523 --> 00:32:46,376
It was a couple of blocks deep,
and whoever fired used a silencer...

498
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:49,313
Find out who fired. Your incompetence
could have cost her life.

499
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:50,631
Are you serious?

500
00:32:50,817 --> 00:32:53,533
- I think your point has been made.
- I decide it myself.

501
00:32:53,693 --> 00:32:54,767
Not on my watch.

502
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:01,832
Why would SWAT do that?
Why would they risk these other people?

503
00:33:01,974 --> 00:33:03,575
It wasn't SWAT.
It was Beck.

504
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:05,391
Respect the man

505
00:33:05,514 --> 00:33:07,766
who sees a way out for his daughter,
and takes it.

506
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:10,479
- No matter what the repercussions.
- Hey, Mister Wolf.

507
00:33:10,969 --> 00:33:13,229
I would have done
exactly the same thing.

508
00:33:13,747 --> 00:33:16,253
You better come see this.
We're getting bombarded.

509
00:33:17,977 --> 00:33:19,776
I checked my messages.
I think it's Beck.

510
00:33:29,527 --> 00:33:31,564
- You've got a problem.
- Yeah, I realize that.

511
00:33:31,685 --> 00:33:32,587
A new problem.

512
00:33:33,153 --> 00:33:36,201
Word's out that you've only negotiated
for Ashley Beck's release.

513
00:33:38,046 --> 00:33:39,636
Where's that information coming from?

514
00:33:39,757 --> 00:33:41,386
That's a hell of a lot less important

515
00:33:41,506 --> 00:33:45,616
than the fact it's a feature
on every live feed right now.

516
00:33:46,175 --> 00:33:48,319
I am not taking the shaft for this.

517
00:33:58,101 --> 00:33:59,240
Hold your fire!

518
00:33:59,368 --> 00:34:00,914
Hold your fire!

519
00:34:05,973 --> 00:34:07,999
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire.

520
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,406
Wolf!

521
00:34:34,631 --> 00:34:35,842
Don't shoot me.

522
00:34:43,513 --> 00:34:44,840
You come bearing gifts now?

523
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,265
No gifts.

524
00:34:48,493 --> 00:34:50,364
Just the best part of the party.

525
00:34:51,442 --> 00:34:53,855
Before we light the candles,
you know what I need from you.

526
00:34:56,238 --> 00:34:57,385
All right.

527
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,999
Hey, henry!
Come on, you're going home.

528
00:35:10,869 --> 00:35:11,986
Come on, get up, man!

529
00:35:25,968 --> 00:35:27,438
I'll see you soon, Rocko.

530
00:35:27,969 --> 00:35:30,158
It's been a pleasure
being a part of your tribe.

531
00:35:30,283 --> 00:35:31,870
The pleasure was mine, my friend.

532
00:35:32,978 --> 00:35:34,917
Come on, fellas, let's go.
Come on, Henry.

533
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:49,010
How about that, huh, buddy-boy?

534
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:52,616
No meringue, right?

535
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:54,298
- No meringue.
- Good, man.

536
00:35:54,422 --> 00:35:56,937
And you know what? I'm not talking
to that FBI bitch anymore.

537
00:35:57,081 --> 00:35:58,223
I'll only talk to you.

538
00:35:58,345 --> 00:35:59,961
It's not my call but I'm working on it.

539
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:02,109
You do that.

540
00:36:19,121 --> 00:36:21,459
Let's get this man
some medical attention!

541
00:36:32,632 --> 00:36:34,375
Mister Wolf.
I apologize.

542
00:36:34,538 --> 00:36:36,660
- That shot wasn't ordered by us.
<i>- Just shut up!</i>

543
00:36:36,782 --> 00:36:38,181
All right?
Shut up!

544
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:39,753
<i>Cause I'm gonna start shooting.</i>

545
00:36:39,894 --> 00:36:42,044
<i>If I ever hear your voice
on this line again,</i>

546
00:36:42,185 --> 00:36:43,594
<i>it's gonna cost people's lives.</i>

547
00:36:43,797 --> 00:36:46,317
Pick up this phone again
and I put blood on your hands,

548
00:36:46,798 --> 00:36:49,547
<i>you got that?
I only speak to Cali and Cali alone!</i>

549
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,547
Crazy sonofabitch.
I knew you wouldn't listen to my ass.

550
00:37:07,988 --> 00:37:09,162
How is she taking it?

551
00:37:09,284 --> 00:37:10,674
I'm hoping for tears.

552
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:14,115
Let's see if Abrami
has the balls to push it through.

553
00:37:14,242 --> 00:37:15,716
We've reopened negotiations.

554
00:37:35,155 --> 00:37:36,517
You gonna explain this?

555
00:37:37,311 --> 00:37:39,620
I did a few months at rikers
a couple of years back.

556
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,259
We didn't exactly
have email in the joint.

557
00:37:42,533 --> 00:37:45,893
During lockdown, we used to have
to find other ways to communicate.

558
00:37:49,808 --> 00:37:52,334
So happy birthday, handsome.
How about that?

559
00:37:52,457 --> 00:37:54,109
Happy birthday, Robby.

560
00:37:54,954 --> 00:37:56,034
All right.

561
00:37:57,676 --> 00:37:58,915
That's it, champ.

562
00:38:08,734 --> 00:38:11,932
Why would they be singing
"happy birthday" out there?

563
00:38:12,105 --> 00:38:14,471
It's somebody's birthday, I guess.

564
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:19,502
When's yours?

565
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,346
You don't wanna tell me?

566
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:24,526
It's kind of the deal.
You know, stay strangers.

567
00:38:24,713 --> 00:38:26,667
Bang at work.
You know, simple.

568
00:38:28,038 --> 00:38:30,104
We've pissed in front of each other.

569
00:38:30,451 --> 00:38:32,873
I think it's safe
to tell me when you were born.

570
00:38:36,282 --> 00:38:37,437
April 25th.

571
00:38:39,907 --> 00:38:41,015
June 27th.

572
00:39:22,263 --> 00:39:25,681
I'm a big fisher.
I love to fish.

573
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,845
Freshwater mostly.
Bass, trout...

574
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,690
It's my favorite pastime.
I love it.

575
00:39:33,136 --> 00:39:34,545
Usually, my days off,

576
00:39:34,733 --> 00:39:36,329
I grab a cooler, pack up some beer,

577
00:39:36,451 --> 00:39:39,061
get a good book, or some music,
and just head out of the city,

578
00:39:39,185 --> 00:39:40,185
clear my head.

579
00:39:42,183 --> 00:39:43,183
Anyway...

580
00:39:44,495 --> 00:39:46,551
That's me in a nutshell.

581
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:50,809
There...

582
00:39:51,936 --> 00:39:53,331
I broke the seal.

583
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:31,536
And this...

584
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:32,813
is your piece.

585
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:35,526
Come on, everybody wants cake.

586
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,283
Thank you.

587
00:40:39,218 --> 00:40:40,758
So who's birthday did you miss?

588
00:40:42,075 --> 00:40:43,075
My son's.

589
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:47,016
Many times.
Especially when I was over there.

590
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:51,654
You know they always say
good soldiers make bad civilians.

591
00:40:56,592 --> 00:40:58,714
He probably missed yours too, right?

592
00:41:00,742 --> 00:41:01,796
Yeah.

593
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:18,542
Thanks.

594
00:41:49,997 --> 00:41:51,584
<i>I just want to go home.</i>
