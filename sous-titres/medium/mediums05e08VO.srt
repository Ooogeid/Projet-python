1
00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:03,784
The question we need answered,
Julie, is...

2
00:00:04,416 --> 00:00:06,866
if it were a matter of life
and death,

3
00:00:07,068 --> 00:00:10,518
could you kill another human being
to protect your family?

4
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,905
Think carefully before you answer,
Julie.

5
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,797
Of course I could.

6
00:00:20,872 --> 00:00:21,771
My family?

7
00:00:22,672 --> 00:00:24,440
Of course. How could I not?

8
00:00:24,864 --> 00:00:27,193
Let's see
what the polygraph has to say.

9
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,281
You know what that sound means.
Let's hear it again.

10
00:00:34,424 --> 00:00:37,286
That is the sound of a lie.

11
00:00:41,015 --> 00:00:43,300
I don't know what to tell you,
Julie, but...

12
00:00:43,425 --> 00:00:45,711
it would appear
that the truth has not been told.

13
00:00:46,052 --> 00:00:47,765
But don't feel bad.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,061
I've been married to some people
I'm not so sure I would kill for.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,279
<i>We'll be right back with Julie,
and more </i>Truth Be Told,

16
00:00:55,404 --> 00:00:56,681
<i>right after this.</i>

17
00:01:02,307 --> 00:01:04,054
He had that all planned.

18
00:01:04,179 --> 00:01:06,315
He had all of those jokes
on one of those...

19
00:01:06,693 --> 00:01:07,993
on a thing, a...

20
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:10,025
- Teleprompter.
- On a teleprompter.

21
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,113
- Sure.
- This is so cool.

22
00:01:12,493 --> 00:01:13,493
Very cool.

23
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:15,952
If you're going to make a fool
of yourself on national TV,

24
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:17,493
that's the show to do it on.

25
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,805
I think we're going to need
some more wine.

26
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,884
Good, you're back.
It's about to start again.

27
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:40,570
I know you're going to think
it's the wine, but...

28
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:42,995
I could swear
I heard something outside.

29
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:47,237
Maybe you shouldn't go out there.

30
00:01:47,362 --> 00:01:49,042
Maybe it was all in my head.

31
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:52,102
We're just going to take a look around,
all right? We'll be right back.

32
00:01:56,272 --> 00:01:58,537
Now, where exactly
did you hear the sound?

33
00:01:58,662 --> 00:02:00,339
I was standing in here.

34
00:02:00,464 --> 00:02:02,494
I didn't even put the lights on.

35
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,993
I grabbed some wine at...

36
00:02:06,577 --> 00:02:07,577
Here.

37
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:09,712
Listen.

38
00:02:12,078 --> 00:02:14,078
I don't hear anything outside.

39
00:02:14,797 --> 00:02:16,761
It's more like it's coming from...

40
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,559
What is going on?
What are you watching?

41
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,982
The news just got boring and you
were asleep and I found this.

42
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,209
Oh, this was so scary in college.

43
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,871
Could you shut it off
and we can go to bed?

44
00:02:35,996 --> 00:02:38,987
Your bad movie is making its way
into my bad dreams.

45
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,809
www.sub-way.fr
www.seriessub.com

46
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,350
God, I hate having to wake you up
like this.

47
00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:37,077
I'm so sorry to stick you
with the kids and breakfast.

48
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:39,446
And getting everybody ready
for school.

49
00:03:39,755 --> 00:03:42,930
But I really have to get in early
and catch up on some things. I love you.

50
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,091
I love you.

51
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:48,807
Girls, come on. Girls, let's go.
It's time for school.

52
00:03:48,932 --> 00:03:50,447
Mom, I need to talk to you.

53
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:53,524
Look at what time it is.
Let's talk in the car.

54
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,902
It's about Hannah's sleepover.
I need to let her know if I can make it.

55
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,186
- And it's all fine with her parents?
- They know. It was their idea.

56
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:02,246
What was that?

57
00:04:02,738 --> 00:04:04,326
- What was what?
- That noise.

58
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:06,516
I think I heard it earlier.

59
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:09,301
Well, I didn't hear anything,
so can I go?

60
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:11,917
- Well, who's going to be there?
- Me and Hannah.

61
00:04:12,096 --> 00:04:14,543
- And no boys.
- No, of course not, Mom.

62
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:17,880
You didn't hear that?

63
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:20,529
That sound? It sounded like a buzz.

64
00:04:21,663 --> 00:04:24,171
- Coming through! Time for school.
- Urgent business.

65
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:25,546
That one?

66
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:27,727
No. I don't know.
You know what, Ariel?

67
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:30,602
Let me think about it,
and I'll tell you later tonight.

68
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:42,362
Can I help you?

69
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:44,583
- You have business here?
- I don't know.

70
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,119
- That depends if you're Joe Dubois.
- Yeah, I'm Joe Dubois.

71
00:04:47,549 --> 00:04:48,599
Mr. Dubois,

72
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,885
you've been served.

73
00:05:09,845 --> 00:05:11,852
<i>He had all of those jokes
on one of those...</i>

74
00:05:12,184 --> 00:05:13,377
<i>on a thing, a...</i>

75
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:15,602
<i>- Teleprompter.
- On a teleprompter.</i>

76
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:17,466
Thanks for making all the way.

77
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:20,233
I know it's a little outside
our jurisdiction, but...

78
00:05:20,358 --> 00:05:23,571
the mayor has a house out here, when
he heard something horrible happened,

79
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,492
he called the local sheriff,
who was only too happy for the help.

80
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:30,409
You all right?

81
00:05:30,609 --> 00:05:31,609
Yeah.

82
00:05:32,742 --> 00:05:34,124
What happened here?

83
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,542
Married couple.

84
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:37,962
Shot to death.

85
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:40,506
Lindsay and Paul Burke.

86
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,074
I saw this place
in my dream last night.

87
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,244
Looks a little different
during the daylight.

88
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:51,091
Where is the other couple?

89
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:53,405
What other couple?
There is no other couple.

90
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:57,574
Lee has been conferring
with the local authorities.

91
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:02,667
The sheriff seems pretty certain
it's just a robbery gone bad.

92
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:04,989
TV equipment is gone,
jewelry box is empty.

93
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:06,865
Other than that,
looks pretty small-time.

94
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,944
No signs of forced entry,

95
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,379
although nobody here seems
to keep their houses locked,

96
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,511
so I'm not sure
what kind of force you'd need.

97
00:06:13,636 --> 00:06:15,749
The couple, the Burkes,
were weekenders.

98
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:19,211
Theory is, the robbers probably got
surprised when they showed up.

99
00:06:19,585 --> 00:06:21,213
Robbers, as in more than one?

100
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:24,133
Deputies found two distinct sets
of boot prints throughout the house.

101
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,053
Size ten, size 11-and-a-half.

102
00:06:26,363 --> 00:06:27,636
Neither match the victims.

103
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:30,889
Also found some hairs that don't appear
to belong to either the man or the wife.

104
00:06:31,396 --> 00:06:33,157
We'll bring those back
to town with us,

105
00:06:33,282 --> 00:06:36,157
see if they yield some DNA
that might already be in the system.

106
00:06:36,716 --> 00:06:39,326
Since the Burkes lived in Phoenix
full-time, they're going to...

107
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:42,067
hand the body over to our coroner
for formal identification.

108
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,704
Does any of this match
up with what you saw?

109
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:46,736
Well, yes and no. I mean,

110
00:06:47,813 --> 00:06:51,764
I only saw one armed man,
and he was wearing a skeleton mask.

111
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:54,473
And, as I told you, in my dream,
there was another couple,

112
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:55,831
an interracial couple.

113
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,625
The husband was white.
The wife was black.

114
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:01,604
Her name was Julie.
They were friends of the Burkes'.

115
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:05,344
No offense, but we're dealing with
a crime with one couple, two killers.

116
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:08,095
I'll ask these guys if they'd be
interested in trading for a two-couple,

117
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,138
one-killer crime scene,
but I'm betting you'll get no takers.

118
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,134
Please don't fight, kids.
We're guests here.

119
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,468
I'm being sued. I'm being sued.
I'm being sued.

120
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,806
I don't understand.
Who would want to sue you?

121
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:20,898
Brantley Atkins.

122
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:25,152
He worked at Aerodytech for six months.
He worked on projects underneath me.

123
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,056
But, you know, he just...
he really wasn't that impressive.

124
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:32,159
But I never did anything to hurt him.
Why would he file a suit like this?

125
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:34,033
It just makes no sense.

126
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,883
He's basically calling me a liar.
A thief.

127
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:39,112
He's saying that it was his idea

128
00:07:39,237 --> 00:07:41,940
for the whole solar amplification
technique and that I stole it from him.

129
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:43,045
It's absurd.

130
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,672
Yeah, but you didn't, so calm down.

131
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,155
I've got to call Terry.
I left him a message that said,

132
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,607
"Hey, you know this idea
you've invested millions in?

133
00:07:50,732 --> 00:07:53,305
"Sorry, but there's some guy out
there who thinks I stole it from him."

134
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,222
Mom, it's Hannah. She really needs
to know if I can make it over on Friday.

135
00:07:56,347 --> 00:07:59,786
- We're hungry. Is dinner ready?
- Ariel, honey, this is not a good time.

136
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:02,981
It's a bad time. Tell Hannah
that I'll call her mom later.

137
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,363
Wait, why are you
going to call her mom?

138
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:07,907
Well, make sure she's okay
with everything.

139
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:11,002
She's totally fine with it.
I told you.

140
00:08:11,438 --> 00:08:13,408
Ew, Bridgette's drinking
from the milk carton.

141
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,618
I am not.

142
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:19,077
Oh, come on.
Didn't anybody hear that?

143
00:08:19,202 --> 00:08:21,543
- Hear what?
- That sound.

144
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:25,611
It sounds like something you'd hear
at a carnival or a... or a game show.

145
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,467
- Mom, she's doing it again.
- I am not.

146
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:32,376
- You're lying.
- I am not.

147
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,449
I was just checking
the expiration date.

148
00:08:37,877 --> 00:08:40,352
Do me a favor. Tell me
that you drank out of the milk carton.

149
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:41,761
But I didn't.

150
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,517
No, I know, honey. I heard you say that,
but just do me a favor.

151
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:49,050
Just say that you did.
I want to see something.

152
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:50,175
Okay.

153
00:08:50,555 --> 00:08:52,255
I drank from the carton.

154
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:55,098
Now say you didn't.

155
00:08:55,223 --> 00:08:57,062
Wait, Mom, what are you doing?

156
00:08:58,393 --> 00:09:01,039
Hannah, I'm going to have to call you
back. It's kind of weird over here.

157
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,000
Bridge, just say you didn't.

158
00:09:03,384 --> 00:09:05,544
Okay, I didn't.
Which is the truth!

159
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:10,405
As seen on TV.

160
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,035
I know it's late and I know
I gave you kind of rough time today,

161
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,810
but is there any way I can get you
to come down to police headquarters?

162
00:09:22,447 --> 00:09:23,447
<i>Now?</i>

163
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:25,839
Once we got the Burkes' bodies
back here,

164
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:27,923
we needed someone
to make a positive ID.

165
00:09:28,048 --> 00:09:30,516
Coroner called Paul Burke's place
of business.

166
00:09:30,641 --> 00:09:32,219
His partner came over.

167
00:09:32,344 --> 00:09:33,694
Brought his wife.

168
00:09:34,828 --> 00:09:36,950
I thought you might
find them interesting.

169
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:52,422
Allison Dubois.

170
00:09:52,637 --> 00:09:54,088
Julie and Michael Skahan.

171
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:55,313
Mrs. Skahan.

172
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:58,263
They've been kind enough to come down
and identify the Burkes' bodies for us.

173
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,481
Mr. Skahan.

174
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,773
I know it's late, and I know you've been
through an awful lot this evening.

175
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,568
How close were you to the Burkes?

176
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:13,988
Close.

177
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:16,242
Very close.

178
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:20,608
Paul was my business partner,

179
00:10:21,345 --> 00:10:22,345
and...

180
00:10:22,566 --> 00:10:24,623
Julie and Lindsay
were good friends, too.

181
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:27,786
Have you ever been out
to their weekend house?

182
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,210
Sure.

183
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,780
A couple times.

184
00:10:31,368 --> 00:10:32,839
But not for months now.

185
00:10:33,622 --> 00:10:34,591
Months?

186
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,678
Five, six.

187
00:10:39,144 --> 00:10:42,516
So you weren't just there watching
television, drinking wine?

188
00:10:44,548 --> 00:10:46,792
Watching television,
drinking wine? No.

189
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,916
And they never said anything to you
about anyone they had an issue with,

190
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,018
anyone who wished them harm or...?

191
00:10:53,143 --> 00:10:54,343
No, not to me.

192
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,613
Did Paul ever say anything to you?

193
00:11:02,153 --> 00:11:03,327
Anything else?

194
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,947
No. I think I have everything
I need.

195
00:11:07,778 --> 00:11:08,792
Thank you.

196
00:11:12,883 --> 00:11:14,553
Again, I'm so sorry
about your friends.

197
00:11:14,678 --> 00:11:16,630
Like I said, happy to be of help.

198
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,679
That's okay.
I'm still awake.

199
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:30,904
Lawsuit on the brain?

200
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:33,621
Something like that.

201
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:37,030
You hear from Terry yet?

202
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:39,763
No, and I left him another message.

203
00:11:41,395 --> 00:11:44,728
That doesn't mean anything, right?
The boss not calling me back?

204
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:47,630
No, of course not.
He's just busy.

205
00:11:47,755 --> 00:11:49,660
And he knows it's a nuisance suit.

206
00:11:49,785 --> 00:11:50,785
Right.

207
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:54,542
I'll buy that.
I like the sound of that.

208
00:11:56,888 --> 00:11:59,051
What was Scanlon's big surprise?

209
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,301
You remember that other couple
in my dream?

210
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,364
It turns out they really do exist.

211
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,345
They were friends of the Burkes'.
They were down at police headquarters

212
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,563
helping identify the bodies, but...

213
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:15,368
But what?

214
00:12:16,171 --> 00:12:19,502
I don't know. I don't think
they were telling the complete truth.

215
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:20,627
About what?

216
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:23,328
About what they know. I mean...

217
00:12:23,697 --> 00:12:25,839
it doesn't make sense,
because they're not in a position

218
00:12:25,964 --> 00:12:27,621
to know about anything anyway.

219
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:29,956
Then why do you think
that they're lying?

220
00:12:32,454 --> 00:12:34,613
This is going to sound crazy, but...

221
00:12:37,906 --> 00:12:40,793
I've had this buzzer
in my head all day.

222
00:12:41,624 --> 00:12:44,429
And whenever I hear a lie,
it buzzes.

223
00:12:47,316 --> 00:12:49,309
You do.
You think it's crazy, don't you?

224
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:50,767
No.

225
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:53,230
No, I believe you.

226
00:12:54,883 --> 00:12:56,417
Don't do that.
Don't patronize me.

227
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,700
What? I'm not patronizing you.

228
00:12:59,432 --> 00:13:01,154
I'm just trying to support you.

229
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,697
Come on.

230
00:13:03,406 --> 00:13:05,764
After everything
that we've been through?

231
00:13:05,992 --> 00:13:08,084
You say you got a buzzer
in your head...

232
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:09,745
you've got a buzzer in your head.

233
00:13:11,661 --> 00:13:15,252
Look, it's nice of you to say that,
but I don't really think you think it.

234
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:19,640
Well, I can't control what you think,
but I do... believe you that is.

235
00:13:21,478 --> 00:13:23,157
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

236
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:24,340
Why?

237
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:25,465
I do.

238
00:13:25,983 --> 00:13:27,764
I mean it, I'm happy to talk.

239
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:30,839
I'm happy to stay up as long
as it takes to work this out.

240
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:35,091
What?!

241
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:38,736
Okay, fine.

242
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:42,845
All right.
But if you change your mind, if you...

243
00:13:43,612 --> 00:13:45,804
if you feel like talking,
even in the middle of the night,

244
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:47,157
just wake me up.

245
00:13:47,465 --> 00:13:48,465
I mean it.

246
00:13:52,588 --> 00:13:53,638
I love you.

247
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:58,829
I know.

248
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,557
How we doing in there?

249
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:08,972
All done.

250
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:11,724
It was right there,

251
00:14:12,332 --> 00:14:13,477
where we left it.

252
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:15,930
I'll gather up my tools
and we'll get out of here.

253
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,255
Wait a second.

254
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:22,266
You hungry?

255
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:25,417
I'm hungry.

256
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:27,758
We ate just two hours ago.

257
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:29,983
No, no, not that kind of hungry.

258
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,740
Cover me.

259
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:57,275
Do you smell that?

260
00:14:58,573 --> 00:15:00,373
Smells good enough to eat.

261
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,483
You stay away from her!

262
00:15:10,332 --> 00:15:12,536
- Get up!
- No, please! No!

263
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,842
- Please! You're hurting me!
- Keep an eye on these folks, huh?

264
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:20,255
I'll make sure I leave some nice,
hot leftovers for you.

265
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:29,719
Have you ever heard of
<i>Truth Be Told?</i>

266
00:15:30,544 --> 00:15:31,555
I'm sorry?

267
00:15:32,953 --> 00:15:34,516
Well, it's a television show.

268
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:36,351
Okay, if you say so.

269
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:38,748
It went off the air
about six months ago.

270
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,887
Remember when we were
at the Burkes' cabin,

271
00:15:41,012 --> 00:15:43,594
I told you I had a dream about them
and another couple?

272
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:46,766
At the time, I thought the things I saw
in the dream took place the night before

273
00:15:46,891 --> 00:15:49,228
that they had something to do
with them being killed.

274
00:15:49,353 --> 00:15:52,082
But now I'm thinking the things
that I saw in my dream

275
00:15:52,207 --> 00:15:53,772
took place at least six months ago.

276
00:15:54,116 --> 00:15:57,466
Okay, two couples get together
to watch some television.

277
00:15:57,684 --> 00:15:59,583
Six months or days ago,
what's the difference?

278
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:02,972
The difference is,
on that night there was a home invasion.

279
00:16:03,097 --> 00:16:04,097
Two men

280
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,795
wearing masks,

281
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:08,875
they were looking for something...
a satchel.

282
00:16:09,623 --> 00:16:13,023
They found it, and then
they tied up both of the couples,

283
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:15,682
and I think
that they raped Mrs. Skahan.

284
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:18,300
Well, I don't know what to tell you,
Allison.

285
00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:20,765
I would think if there had been
a report of a home invasion

286
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,023
or a sexual assault for that matter,

287
00:16:23,435 --> 00:16:26,734
the sheriff's department would have
mentioned it. And even if there were,

288
00:16:27,043 --> 00:16:29,863
what does any of that have to do with
the killing of Lindsay and Paul Burke?

289
00:16:31,511 --> 00:16:32,661
I don't know.

290
00:16:33,002 --> 00:16:34,558
But I keep having these dreams.

291
00:16:34,683 --> 00:16:38,163
Maybe the men who assaulted all four
of them six months ago came back

292
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:40,582
and murdered Paul and Lindsay.

293
00:16:40,904 --> 00:16:44,537
And maybe Julie and Michael say nothing
'cause they're afraid to be next.

294
00:16:44,662 --> 00:16:45,812
I'm not sure.

295
00:16:46,474 --> 00:16:49,676
The only thing I'm sure about is,
we need to bring them back in here.

296
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,254
We need to talk
to Julie and Michael again.

297
00:16:57,835 --> 00:16:58,933
Hi. Can I help you?

298
00:16:59,254 --> 00:17:01,115
Mr. Dubois, I'm Jack Herkosh.

299
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,271
I'm an attorney.
I work for Terry Cavanaugh.

300
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,967
<i>At Aerodytech, we were always
encouraged to present our ideas</i>

301
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,489
<i>to our project manager.</i>

302
00:17:08,614 --> 00:17:11,860
<i>And one of the ideas I developed
was this concept for a solar cell</i>

303
00:17:11,985 --> 00:17:14,632
<i>that used reflective mirrors
to amplify its power.</i>

304
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:17,849
<i>And you presented that concept
to your project manager at the time...</i>

305
00:17:17,974 --> 00:17:19,704
<i>- Mr. Joseph Dubois?
- That's correct.</i>

306
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,974
<i>I presented Mr. Dubois with my idea.</i>

307
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:25,976
<i>He said the concept had potential,
but no one ever followed up with it.</i>

308
00:17:26,243 --> 00:17:27,669
<i>And now I realize</i>

309
00:17:27,794 --> 00:17:30,837
<i>that's because he was planning
to appropriate the idea for himself.</i>

310
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:34,469
<i>And how did you present
your concepts to Mr. Dubois?</i>

311
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:38,060
<i>Through an inter-office memo.
That's standard procedure at Aerodytech.</i>

312
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:40,482
<i>The piece of paper
that you're holding in your hand,</i>

313
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,780
<i>is that the same one
you gave to Mr. Dubois?</i>

314
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:44,390
<i>It is.</i>

315
00:17:44,515 --> 00:17:46,971
That is just not true.

316
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:50,026
He never gave me any memo
about solar cells.

317
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,071
This is the copy of the memo
that his attorneys sent to us.

318
00:18:01,696 --> 00:18:03,232
"There might be some potential here.

319
00:18:03,357 --> 00:18:05,773
"Let's run it up the flagpole
and see what happens.

320
00:18:05,898 --> 00:18:06,767
"J.D."

321
00:18:06,892 --> 00:18:08,674
- Isn't that your handwriting?
- Yeah.

322
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,172
- Aren't those your initials?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

323
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:14,166
I understand that...

324
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,345
this may not be an easy time,
but we just have a few more questions.

325
00:18:17,923 --> 00:18:19,681
- Anything.
- Absolutely.

326
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:21,972
This may seem a bit far afield,

327
00:18:22,097 --> 00:18:24,764
but we're investigating the possibility
that a home invasion

328
00:18:24,889 --> 00:18:27,913
took place at the Burkes' cabin
approximately six months ago.

329
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,775
Do either of you have
any knowledge of this?

330
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:36,698
Paul certainly never
mentioned anything like that to me.

331
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,030
Mrs. Skahan?

332
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:41,828
No. I never heard
about such a thing.

333
00:18:43,203 --> 00:18:44,903
So, that being the case,

334
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,510
I assume it's safe to say
that neither of you were there

335
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:49,919
on this particular night?

336
00:18:50,184 --> 00:18:51,734
Where? The cabin? No.

337
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,729
Again, this home invasion
you're talking about...

338
00:18:54,854 --> 00:18:57,869
I don't think it ever happened,
much less our being there.

339
00:19:03,693 --> 00:19:07,061
Mr. Skahan, forgive me for asking this,
but the scar above your eye...

340
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,443
how long have you had that,
and how did you get it?

341
00:19:09,568 --> 00:19:11,027
This? About...

342
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:13,568
about a year.

343
00:19:14,341 --> 00:19:15,653
I go mountain biking.

344
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,250
Took a tumble last year.

345
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,160
What does this have to do
with Paul and Lindsay?

346
00:19:22,957 --> 00:19:25,046
I'm not at liberty
to say at the moment.

347
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:28,175
Mrs. Skahan,
this is a delicate question,

348
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,543
but have you ever been
the victim of a sexual assault?

349
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:37,008
Mrs. Skahan,
I really need you to answer.

350
00:19:39,326 --> 00:19:41,634
No. I've never been
sexually assaulted.

351
00:19:43,638 --> 00:19:44,641
You're lying.

352
00:19:46,138 --> 00:19:49,436
Mrs. Skahan, I know what happened
to you was incredibly personal,

353
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:51,602
incredibly painful,

354
00:19:52,411 --> 00:19:54,274
- but we need your help.
- Fine.

355
00:19:55,957 --> 00:19:58,988
We've offered to provide it,
but these questions are nonsensical.

356
00:19:59,827 --> 00:20:01,908
This stuff has nothing to do
with Paul and Lindsay.

357
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,411
I know this must all seem terribly
cryptic to you,

358
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,997
but we really are trying to find out
exactly what happened to your friends

359
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,744
and who's responsible.

360
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:16,829
I want to thank you both again
for coming down to meet with us.

361
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,971
Sorry if we said anything
to upset you.

362
00:20:19,096 --> 00:20:21,427
And I promise you,
we will get to the bottom of this.

363
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,061
They're lying, both of them.

364
00:20:30,615 --> 00:20:32,861
Fine. He didn't get the scar
from riding his bike

365
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:35,544
and she was assaulted
and doesn't want to talk about it.

366
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:38,570
- None of that is against the law.
- They know more than they're telling.

367
00:20:39,328 --> 00:20:41,138
Maybe and maybe not.

368
00:20:41,263 --> 00:20:43,357
What else do you want me to do,
Allison?

369
00:20:43,874 --> 00:20:46,374
I just questioned two citizens
without cause,

370
00:20:46,499 --> 00:20:49,713
without a shred of evidence
and without an attorney present.

371
00:20:49,838 --> 00:20:51,870
That's all the risk-taking

372
00:20:51,995 --> 00:20:53,973
I'm prepared to do for you
on this case.

373
00:20:54,535 --> 00:20:56,796
And by the way,
I've nothing to show for it.

374
00:20:57,858 --> 00:20:59,757
I think you and I are done
for the day.

375
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,234
Daddy, we need to get to bed.

376
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,758
But Mommy isn't here,
and we need our kisses.

377
00:21:07,112 --> 00:21:09,540
Well, can you come over
here and give them to us?

378
00:21:09,665 --> 00:21:12,228
Well,
I kind of can't right now, sweetie.

379
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,023
Well, then, can we come over
there and get them from you?

380
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,611
- Not unless you could fly.
- I could fly.

381
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,536
- No, you can't.
- Hello.

382
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,576
Hey, whoo, what's all this stuff?

383
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:30,214
This is my whole life at Aerodytech.

384
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:32,750
It's everything I've ever worked on,
every memo,

385
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,667
every file, every project.

386
00:21:35,177 --> 00:21:37,896
- Mommy, can we have our kisses now?
- Of course.

387
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:40,770
And you.

388
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,789
All right, you little,
little sweet things, go on, go to bed.

389
00:21:45,914 --> 00:21:48,918
I'll be in in a minute.
And brush, brush your teeth.

390
00:21:49,043 --> 00:21:50,543
- I will.
- I will.

391
00:21:53,436 --> 00:21:55,897
I take it things didn't go well
with the lawyer.

392
00:21:56,371 --> 00:21:58,389
This guy has a memo.
He's got a memo

393
00:21:58,514 --> 00:22:01,132
of a schematic of a solar cell
just like mine.

394
00:22:01,257 --> 00:22:04,675
It's got handwritten notes all over it
in my handwriting from me.

395
00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:08,266
Problem is, I don't remember
ever seeing this before today.

396
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,537
I don't understand.
I know I didn't steal this idea.

397
00:22:13,752 --> 00:22:16,376
- Do me a favor. Say that again.
- Say what again?

398
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:18,544
Say, "I know I didn't steal
this idea."

399
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:19,921
No, I didn't.

400
00:22:21,476 --> 00:22:23,299
I know.
In fact, I'm certain of it.

401
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,228
You're just saying that
'cause you're my wife.

402
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,029
True, but I'm also saying it

403
00:22:28,154 --> 00:22:30,390
because I didn't hear that buzzer
go off in my head.

404
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,251
<i>The piece of paper
that you're holding in your hand,</i>

405
00:22:34,376 --> 00:22:36,306
<i>is that the same one
you gave to Mr. Dubois?</i>

406
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:37,431
<i>It is.</i>

407
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,560
So?

408
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,611
So I don't know what to tell you, Joe.
I don't hear a thing.

409
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:47,001
He's not lying, Joe.

410
00:22:48,806 --> 00:22:50,567
Neither one of you is lying.

411
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:23,743
What'd that idiot do?

412
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:36,882
Don't shoot.

413
00:23:37,962 --> 00:23:38,875
I beg you.

414
00:23:41,464 --> 00:23:43,150
I'm putting down my weapon.

415
00:23:46,722 --> 00:23:48,797
I don't know what happened in there.

416
00:23:49,022 --> 00:23:50,496
I don't want to know.

417
00:23:51,949 --> 00:23:53,263
I'm not a killer.

418
00:23:57,284 --> 00:23:58,439
There you go.

419
00:24:00,643 --> 00:24:01,743
I'm unarmed.

420
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:09,605
You don't want to kill me.

421
00:24:10,806 --> 00:24:13,734
I mean, him,
that was self-defense, but me...

422
00:24:15,696 --> 00:24:17,497
I'm standing here with nothing.

423
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,124
I had nothing!

424
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,292
I know.

425
00:24:21,746 --> 00:24:23,455
But that wasn't me!

426
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,570
I beg you.

427
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,449
Let's not make this any worse.

428
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:35,637
You put down your weapon.

429
00:24:36,356 --> 00:24:37,356
I'll leave.

430
00:24:37,481 --> 00:24:40,172
You can call the police,
you can give them the other guy.

431
00:24:42,764 --> 00:24:43,864
Come on now.

432
00:24:44,153 --> 00:24:45,274
Help me out.

433
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,360
Tell your friend here
to lower her gun.

434
00:24:49,094 --> 00:24:50,488
Tell her to let me leave.

435
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:04,669
Sorry to interrupt.

436
00:25:05,063 --> 00:25:08,380
I think I know why the Skahans
lied to us about the home invasion,

437
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,507
about the rape, about the scar,
about all of it.

438
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:14,345
Julie Skahan shot and killed
her attackers that night.

439
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,097
That's why they never reported it.

440
00:25:16,386 --> 00:25:18,856
The Burkes were there,
Michael, they all saw it.

441
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,777
Now, how that ties into the Burkes being
murdered last week, I'm not sure yet...

442
00:25:22,902 --> 00:25:25,189
Allison,
we already know who killed the Burkes.

443
00:25:26,718 --> 00:25:28,673
DNA came back. It's a perfect match.

444
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,947
Two ex-cons named Zachary Giltner,
Jacob Vallillo.

445
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,622
Work as a team.
Each one has a laundry list

446
00:25:35,747 --> 00:25:38,139
of breaking-and-entering charges,
armed robbery.

447
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:41,619
This one even has a history
of sexual violence.

448
00:25:41,912 --> 00:25:44,085
Been out of prison
a little over six months now.

449
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,378
No, no, these men couldn't have killed
the Burkes. Definitely not this one.

450
00:25:47,985 --> 00:25:49,569
Allison, how can you be so sure?

451
00:25:49,694 --> 00:25:53,319
I'm telling you, Julie Skahan shot
this man and probably this one, too.

452
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:56,304
Only it was six months ago.
It wasn't the other day.

453
00:25:56,703 --> 00:25:59,223
Then how do you explain the DNA?
How do you explain the hair?

454
00:26:00,548 --> 00:26:01,642
The DNA's wrong.

455
00:26:02,024 --> 00:26:04,692
It's not just the DNA. The bootprints
we found at the scene matched

456
00:26:04,817 --> 00:26:06,439
the shoe sizes of both suspects.

457
00:26:06,852 --> 00:26:10,193
The medical examiner also recovered a
bullet fragment from one of the victims.

458
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:13,016
The ballistics match the same
unrecovered weapon they used

459
00:26:13,141 --> 00:26:14,947
in a series of robberies
four years ago.

460
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,503
This doesn't make any sense.
I saw them in my dream.

461
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,034
We have everything we need
to issue a warrant on these two guys.

462
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:25,788
The only thing we don't have
is the two of them in custody.

463
00:26:25,913 --> 00:26:29,712
So, if you happen to have a dream about
where the two of them are hiding,

464
00:26:29,837 --> 00:26:32,840
that's something I'd like to hear about,
but short of that...

465
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:46,736
It was self-defense.

466
00:26:48,245 --> 00:26:50,070
We're all clear on that, right?

467
00:26:50,195 --> 00:26:52,495
- Julie had no choice.
- Obviously.

468
00:26:53,052 --> 00:26:54,946
We all get it.
It was self-defense.

469
00:26:59,354 --> 00:27:01,104
Anybody look in this bag?

470
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:07,509
This is what they were ripping up those
floorboards. This is why they were here.

471
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,401
There's almost
a million dollars in here.

472
00:27:10,526 --> 00:27:13,123
- Are you kidding?
- All right, stop handling it.

473
00:27:13,626 --> 00:27:16,286
Getting your prints all over it is just
gonna complicate it for the police

474
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:17,561
when we call.

475
00:27:19,595 --> 00:27:21,681
Wait. Is that what we're doing?

476
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:23,465
Calling the police?

477
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,351
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

478
00:27:25,893 --> 00:27:28,193
I'm talking about a million dollars.

479
00:27:29,098 --> 00:27:30,772
You want to call the police?

480
00:27:30,897 --> 00:27:31,897
What for?

481
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:33,865
These two are already dead.

482
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,224
It's not like they can be punished
any further.

483
00:27:36,349 --> 00:27:38,990
The whole self-defense thing,
why even open it up for discussion?

484
00:27:40,188 --> 00:27:41,188
I mean...

485
00:27:41,597 --> 00:27:43,497
Think about it.
Maybe we...

486
00:27:43,991 --> 00:27:45,204
don't call the police.

487
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,993
Nobody asks about who killed who,
and...

488
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:51,752
we split this money.

489
00:27:52,161 --> 00:27:53,863
Paul, that's insane.

490
00:27:54,154 --> 00:27:56,393
There are two dead bodies
in our house.

491
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,420
I'm just saying...

492
00:28:00,823 --> 00:28:04,488
do you really want to put Julie through
any more than she's been through?

493
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,000
The questions, the lawyers?

494
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,386
Look at her.

495
00:28:12,894 --> 00:28:14,894
All we have to do is clean up,

496
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:16,485
get rid of these two.

497
00:28:18,345 --> 00:28:20,595
There's a lot of money in that bag.

498
00:28:39,002 --> 00:28:40,002
Michael?

499
00:28:41,196 --> 00:28:43,054
You were gone so long,
I was worried.

500
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:45,659
You didn't answer your cell.

501
00:28:46,214 --> 00:28:47,314
How'd it go?

502
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:49,820
Oh, my God.

503
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:53,031
What happened?

504
00:28:54,177 --> 00:28:55,177
Nothing.

505
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:58,584
Just ended up being a little more...

506
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:02,067
complicated than I had planned,
that's all.

507
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:09,959
What do you mean, "complicated"?

508
00:29:11,838 --> 00:29:12,888
Just got...

509
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:14,939
you know...

510
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:17,910
crazy.

511
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:20,672
No, I don't know.

512
00:29:22,168 --> 00:29:23,545
Didn't they understand?

513
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,732
Didn't they see our point of view?

514
00:29:27,321 --> 00:29:28,321
No...

515
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,726
not at first.

516
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,093
They didn't understand.
They did not share our point of view.

517
00:29:43,098 --> 00:29:44,148
But then...

518
00:29:48,993 --> 00:29:49,995
You did it.

519
00:30:03,173 --> 00:30:04,323
What is that?

520
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,142
Where'd you get that?

521
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:14,311
You know exactly where I got it.

522
00:30:15,194 --> 00:30:16,294
You took it?

523
00:30:17,807 --> 00:30:20,151
You took the gun from that night?
You took that with you?

524
00:30:21,465 --> 00:30:23,273
Why would you do that?

525
00:30:24,413 --> 00:30:26,113
Thought I might need it.

526
00:30:30,323 --> 00:30:31,623
Turns out I did.

527
00:30:33,484 --> 00:30:35,173
My God, Michael,

528
00:30:37,122 --> 00:30:38,377
what did you do?

529
00:30:39,132 --> 00:30:41,672
Did exactly what I said
I was gonna do, Jules.

530
00:30:42,844 --> 00:30:43,883
I explained

531
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,320
that with the doctor bills
and your therapy,

532
00:30:48,034 --> 00:30:51,261
we'd gone through our share
of the money, that we need more.

533
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:55,686
But when I think about
what you went through that night,

534
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:58,522
we should have taken more
from the beginning.

535
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,090
What happened?

536
00:31:02,466 --> 00:31:04,195
I don't know.
Paul got angry.

537
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:06,877
He started saying that...

538
00:31:07,603 --> 00:31:09,699
what happened to you
wasn't his problem.

539
00:31:10,103 --> 00:31:13,053
Told me if I ever tried
to strong-arm him again,

540
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:16,013
he'd tell the police
how you killed those two men.

541
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:19,673
How the one guy was unarmed

542
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:21,587
and pleading for his life.

543
00:31:22,704 --> 00:31:23,704
So...

544
00:31:25,357 --> 00:31:26,422
so I left.

545
00:31:28,006 --> 00:31:29,556
And then I came back,

546
00:31:31,287 --> 00:31:32,637
pulled the gun...

547
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:37,172
made him show me
where he hid his share of the money.

548
00:31:46,477 --> 00:31:47,477
It's okay.

549
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:49,529
It's gonna be okay.

550
00:31:50,482 --> 00:31:51,532
Not my gun.

551
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,643
Not my anything.

552
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:57,398
Before I went back there
the second time,

553
00:31:59,048 --> 00:32:00,598
I dug up our friends,

554
00:32:01,738 --> 00:32:04,880
put on their clothes, their shoes.
It was like it wasn't me.

555
00:32:12,267 --> 00:32:15,394
The two men who attacked you,
what did you do with their bodies?

556
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,593
You must have done something
with them.

557
00:32:18,526 --> 00:32:20,734
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

558
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,380
Did you bury them, yes or no?

559
00:32:26,238 --> 00:32:27,849
Did your husband bury them?

560
00:32:27,974 --> 00:32:29,937
I don't know
what you're talking about.

561
00:32:30,062 --> 00:32:32,240
How could he have buried them
if we've never met them,

562
00:32:32,745 --> 00:32:35,126
never been in the same room
with them?

563
00:32:35,251 --> 00:32:37,024
These people killed our friends.

564
00:32:37,149 --> 00:32:39,181
It's cruel of you to come around here
this way.

565
00:32:39,306 --> 00:32:41,222
Did he bury them near the cabin?

566
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,260
Did he bury them
in the front or the back?

567
00:32:44,543 --> 00:32:46,072
I'm closing this door now,

568
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:48,797
and if you don't get out of here,
I'm calling the police.

569
00:32:48,922 --> 00:32:50,022
I mean that.

570
00:32:50,643 --> 00:32:52,443
Yeah. Yeah, I believe you.

571
00:32:53,734 --> 00:32:55,584
Is that a yes to the front?

572
00:32:57,795 --> 00:32:59,195
It doesn't matter.

573
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:00,944
We'll figure it out.

574
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:04,273
Sir, we're gonna need
some bloodhounds.

575
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:07,973
I made it abundantly clear to you to
have no more contact with the Skahans.

576
00:33:08,098 --> 00:33:11,832
Yet not ten minutes ago I received
a phone call from their attorney,

577
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:15,576
- threatening to file a harassment suit
- Sir, nothing is as it appears to be.

578
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,828
because one of my employees
paid an unannounced visit

579
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:21,373
The people you think murdered the Burkes
have been dead for months and months!

580
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,007
Dead! For months
and months... how could that be?

581
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:26,509
Their DNA was found all over
the Burkes' bodies!

582
00:33:26,634 --> 00:33:29,931
Yes, those two criminals' DNA
was found all over the Burkes' bodies

583
00:33:30,056 --> 00:33:33,344
because someone dug them up and spread
their DNA all over the Burkes' bodies.

584
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:36,013
- And who would do that?
- The Skahans!

585
00:33:38,215 --> 00:33:40,795
They murdered those two men
six months ago.

586
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,754
Then they buried their bodies
nearby the Burkes' cabin.

587
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:45,430
Then they dug them up,

588
00:33:45,555 --> 00:33:49,316
so that they could plant evidence
after they murdered the Burkes

589
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:50,611
three days ago.

590
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:54,844
That is why we need
these bloodhounds.

591
00:33:55,644 --> 00:33:58,483
Sir, if we don't waste time arguing,

592
00:33:58,608 --> 00:34:00,997
those graves will still be fresh.

593
00:34:01,451 --> 00:34:03,351
They shouldn't hard to find.

594
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,752
- Allison Dubois.
- <i>Allison Dubois?</i>

595
00:34:08,877 --> 00:34:11,793
<i>What are the chances? Do you know?
We have the same last name.</i>

596
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,490
- <i>What do you say we get married?</i>
- No, I can't...

597
00:34:14,615 --> 00:34:17,054
my kids are home alone,
my husband's working late, sorry.

598
00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:20,467
Well, actually, I'm going home.

599
00:34:22,531 --> 00:34:25,813
I finally spoke to Terry,
so I'm gonna get out of here.

600
00:34:26,287 --> 00:34:29,964
<i>Oh, by the way, I called the girls,
I spoke to Ariel, everybody's fine.</i>

601
00:34:30,089 --> 00:34:32,492
Yeah, I know... I talked to her, too.
So, wait a second,

602
00:34:32,617 --> 00:34:34,780
you said you talked to Terry Cavanaugh?
What did he say?

603
00:34:35,677 --> 00:34:36,927
It was painful.

604
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,432
I tried to convince him not to settle.
I told him I thought we should fight,

605
00:34:40,557 --> 00:34:43,536
and he said I should worry
about building solar cells

606
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,697
<i>and leave all the business stuff
to him.</i>

607
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:46,972
I'm so sorry.

608
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,771
They start negotiating
with Brantley's attorney tomorrow,

609
00:34:49,896 --> 00:34:52,923
<i>and he says he thinks the whole thing'll
be over in a week.</i>

610
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:59,181
Joe, I got to go, Devalos is calling me.
I'll be home as soon as I can.

611
00:35:05,446 --> 00:35:06,996
I owe you an apology.

612
00:35:08,502 --> 00:35:09,702
We found them.

613
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:12,676
Zach Giltner and Jacob Vallillo.

614
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:15,279
Both bodies were buried in the woods
behind the Burkes' cabin.

615
00:35:16,304 --> 00:35:18,407
So what do we do now,
we pick up the Skahans?

616
00:35:18,997 --> 00:35:20,119
I don't think I can,

617
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:23,376
there's still no evidence to link them
to any of these murders.

618
00:35:24,224 --> 00:35:27,754
Unless something new presents itself,
I have no grounds to go after them on.

619
00:35:28,196 --> 00:35:31,956
If the Skahans did do this, they did
a terrific job of covering it up.

620
00:35:32,081 --> 00:35:34,831
I'm starting to think
they might even get away with it.

621
00:35:47,153 --> 00:35:49,317
Do you know
it's 5:00 in the morning?

622
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:50,994
What are you doing?

623
00:35:51,638 --> 00:35:55,642
I'm trying to find a logical explanation
for something that seems to defy logic.

624
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:57,408
What do you mean?

625
00:35:57,654 --> 00:36:00,152
Well, if this is every piece of paper
that ever crossed my desk

626
00:36:00,277 --> 00:36:02,005
while I worked at Aerodytech,

627
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,711
and this is a copy of something
that I apparently saw and commented on,

628
00:36:05,836 --> 00:36:08,415
then how come I can't find the original,
how come I can't find my copy?

629
00:36:09,284 --> 00:36:12,832
Well, maybe you made your comments
on the one you gave to Brantley Atkins

630
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:14,444
and he has the original.

631
00:36:14,811 --> 00:36:17,032
No. No, 'cause I have everything.

632
00:36:17,157 --> 00:36:18,491
I have... I have a...

633
00:36:18,616 --> 00:36:22,620
I have the bulletins that they announce
the specials on at the cafeteria.

634
00:36:23,992 --> 00:36:27,501
I mean, he's swearing that I did this.
You're swearing that I did this.

635
00:36:27,974 --> 00:36:31,350
No. No, I didn't, I didn't say that.
I'd never say such a thing.

636
00:36:31,475 --> 00:36:33,440
I know you're not capable
of such a thing.

637
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:37,425
I just said, whatever he's saying
on that tape is the truth.

638
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:40,798
And you don't see
a contradiction in that?

639
00:36:41,235 --> 00:36:42,366
Not necessarily.

640
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,558
<i>The piece of paper
you're holding in your hand,</i>

641
00:36:44,683 --> 00:36:46,768
<i>is that the same one
you gave to Mr. Dubois?</i>

642
00:36:46,893 --> 00:36:47,893
<i>It is.</i>

643
00:36:50,263 --> 00:36:51,613
No buzzer, right?

644
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:53,023
No buzzer.

645
00:36:53,148 --> 00:36:55,710
But all he's saying is, the piece
of paper he's holding in his hand

646
00:36:55,835 --> 00:36:57,559
is the same one he gave to you.

647
00:36:57,684 --> 00:36:59,584
He's not saying that paper...

648
00:37:00,516 --> 00:37:02,573
and this paper are the same paper.

649
00:37:03,158 --> 00:37:04,888
I can't even see
the paper he's holding.

650
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:07,099
You think he's talking
about a different memo?

651
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:14,883
Hello, Brantley.

652
00:37:17,065 --> 00:37:20,728
I have to say, this is highly
inappropriate, Joe, meeting like this,

653
00:37:20,853 --> 00:37:22,322
given our current situation.

654
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:25,630
I realize that. I just thought perhaps
we could make a little more headwa

655
00:37:25,755 --> 00:37:27,384
if we met face-to-face.

656
00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:28,709
Whatever, Joe.

657
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:33,537
I know this has been difficult
for you.

658
00:37:33,662 --> 00:37:35,002
I've always liked you.

659
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:38,338
It's just business,
this is nothing personal.

660
00:37:39,484 --> 00:37:41,765
Yeah, I've been hearing
that a lot this week.

661
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:45,596
So I must admit, I mean,
this whole thing had me really confused.

662
00:37:46,605 --> 00:37:48,616
I watched your testimony
over and over...

663
00:37:48,741 --> 00:37:50,918
I was convinced that you were lying.

664
00:37:51,587 --> 00:37:54,645
You said that you gave me
this piece of paper,

665
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:55,815
This memo.

666
00:37:58,255 --> 00:38:01,742
But you weren't lying. Not technically.
You did give me that piece of paper.

667
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:05,367
The only problem was, it didn't look
like that when you gave it to me.

668
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,577
It looked like this.

669
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,318
How'd you do it?
Is it like check-washing?

670
00:38:14,642 --> 00:38:17,210
How much time did you have to spend
doctoring this memo?

671
00:38:20,033 --> 00:38:22,591
This doesn't change anything...
I'm not dropping the suit.

672
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:25,784
That's up to you, man.
I don't care.

673
00:38:28,052 --> 00:38:30,681
I'm confident this idea is mine
and mine alone.

674
00:38:32,473 --> 00:38:34,352
But when people find out
what you did here,

675
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:37,730
and it ruins any semblance
of a reputation that you might have,

676
00:38:38,421 --> 00:38:40,817
it's not business, it's personal.

677
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:51,036
I'm sure by now you've seen
these pictures in the paper and on TV.

678
00:38:51,437 --> 00:38:53,611
These are the men
who killed the Burkes?

679
00:38:55,448 --> 00:38:59,169
They were also the main suspects in
an armored car robbery five years ago.

680
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:02,888
We found their DNA at the murder scene
last week and...

681
00:39:03,013 --> 00:39:04,942
assumed that we had our killers.

682
00:39:05,957 --> 00:39:07,237
Funny thing, though,

683
00:39:07,362 --> 00:39:08,462
yesterday...

684
00:39:08,754 --> 00:39:12,604
we found their bodies in two recently
dug graves behind the Burkes' cabin.

685
00:39:13,158 --> 00:39:16,264
And based on the rate of decomposition,
the medical examiner is fairly certain

686
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:18,271
they've been dead several months.

687
00:39:18,463 --> 00:39:20,813
We believe whoever killed
the Burkes would've had to have known

688
00:39:20,938 --> 00:39:22,938
where these bodies were buried

689
00:39:23,203 --> 00:39:24,987
in order to plant that DNA evidence.

690
00:39:25,974 --> 00:39:28,740
I'm sorry,
what does all this have to do with us?

691
00:39:29,152 --> 00:39:30,402
You don't know?

692
00:39:32,426 --> 00:39:35,255
It means that
we're looking for a person or...

693
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,846
persons who killed not just two people
but four.

694
00:39:38,018 --> 00:39:40,068
These two men five
or six months ago,

695
00:39:40,193 --> 00:39:42,328
and the Burkes earlier this week.

696
00:39:43,793 --> 00:39:45,090
And we think we found them.

697
00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:47,225
Really?

698
00:39:51,553 --> 00:39:52,653
You mean us?

699
00:39:54,011 --> 00:39:57,352
Are you suggesting the two of us
are responsible for these killings?

700
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,896
No, Mr. Skahan, we're not suggesting
the two of you, just Julie.

701
00:40:02,009 --> 00:40:02,898
You see,

702
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:07,071
the killer took great care in planting
DNA evidence at the Burke murder scene,

703
00:40:07,617 --> 00:40:10,015
but what he, or she, forgot

704
00:40:10,434 --> 00:40:13,113
was to take equal care
after killing these two men.

705
00:40:13,238 --> 00:40:15,579
And we believe the killer's DNA
is still on one of them,

706
00:40:16,243 --> 00:40:18,330
Left behind after
a forcible sex act.

707
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:21,195
Even if it were,

708
00:40:22,107 --> 00:40:25,047
- that hardly proves...
- It proves that both of you lied...

709
00:40:25,532 --> 00:40:28,175
about that night, about being there,
about what happened.

710
00:40:28,388 --> 00:40:31,060
It gives me means and motive,

711
00:40:31,185 --> 00:40:34,620
at least as far as the murders of
Vallillon and Giltner are concerned.

712
00:40:34,811 --> 00:40:38,156
And since the attacks and murders
occurred at the Burkes' cabin,

713
00:40:38,281 --> 00:40:41,596
it's not unreasonable to assume
that they were witnesses

714
00:40:41,721 --> 00:40:44,336
and killed to assure their silence.

715
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:47,752
Mrs. Skahan,
I'm in possession of a court order

716
00:40:47,877 --> 00:40:50,030
compelling you to provide us
with a DNA sample.

717
00:40:51,378 --> 00:40:54,140
Detective Scanlon here
will escort you downstairs.

718
00:40:55,293 --> 00:40:56,293
Wait.

719
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,390
- Wait.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Skahan, you...

720
00:40:59,673 --> 00:41:01,353
you have something to add?

721
00:41:05,913 --> 00:41:07,413
I killed the Burkes.

722
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:10,461
Julie wasn't even there.

723
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,844
I killed the Burkes.

724
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,981
Well, that's very noble,

725
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:17,516
Mr. Skahan, but I need more
than your word, I need proof.

726
00:41:21,468 --> 00:41:22,668
In the garage.

727
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:25,997
Under the drain in the floor.

728
00:41:26,489 --> 00:41:28,443
That's where I put the gun
I used to kill them.

729
00:41:31,842 --> 00:41:34,074
And those two bastards
who wanted to rape my wife.

730
00:41:37,183 --> 00:41:38,695
And I'd do it again.

731
00:41:41,787 --> 00:41:42,666
He's lying.

732
00:41:43,598 --> 00:41:44,543
Mr. Skahan?

733
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:49,506
I'm prepared to dictate a confession...
right now.

734
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,456
Get a stenographer up here, please.

735
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,557
You can't do this,
you can't let this happen.

736
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:02,418
Say something.

737
00:42:03,102 --> 00:42:04,902
You have to say something.

738
00:42:06,805 --> 00:42:07,805
I love you.

739
00:42:12,384 --> 00:42:13,584
You all right?

740
00:42:15,823 --> 00:42:16,823
Yeah.

741
00:42:17,294 --> 00:42:19,444
It's like she said on television.

742
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:21,930
She would do anything for him.

743
00:42:22,872 --> 00:42:24,916
And I guess he'd do
anything for her.

744
00:42:28,029 --> 00:42:29,834
Take the man's confession.
