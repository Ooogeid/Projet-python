1
00:00:01,505 --> 00:00:03,139
We believe the resistance
on the part of the consumer

2
00:00:03,207 --> 00:00:04,374
is a function
of the fact

3
00:00:04,442 --> 00:00:06,242
they haven't had a
product to respond to.

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,111
Those days are ending.

5
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:10,080
The technology for the
delivery of hybrid cars

6
00:00:10,147 --> 00:00:11,681
to the marketplace
is ripe.

7
00:00:11,749 --> 00:00:13,750
If the company wants
to stay ahead of the curve,

8
00:00:13,818 --> 00:00:15,785
we should make
an aggressive expansion

9
00:00:15,853 --> 00:00:17,187
into the market.

10
00:00:17,254 --> 00:00:19,856
Now.

11
00:00:19,924 --> 00:00:21,858
Mr. Dubois?

12
00:00:21,926 --> 00:00:24,160
Are you... all right?

13
00:00:24,228 --> 00:00:25,995
Oh, I-I'm fine.

14
00:00:26,063 --> 00:00:27,931
I'm just not sure
why you boys asked me

15
00:00:27,998 --> 00:00:30,800
to cut short my Friday morning
golf game for this.

16
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:32,702
You know, I'm confused.

17
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,070
You know, while
you were talking,

18
00:00:34,138 --> 00:00:35,872
it sounded to me like

19
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,274
I was in some
socialist country in Europe

20
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:41,811
and not here in the heart of
the United States of America.

21
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,147
So, let me tell
you something.

22
00:00:44,215 --> 00:00:47,383
Americans love their cars.

23
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:49,452
The bigger, the better.

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,322
They're not worried
about gas mileage.

25
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:54,791
And they sure as hell
don't want to buy something

26
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:56,826
that runs on batteries.

27
00:00:56,894 --> 00:00:58,094
(chuckles)

28
00:00:58,162 --> 00:01:00,130
You know what runs on batteries?

29
00:01:00,231 --> 00:01:01,498
Toys.

30
00:01:01,565 --> 00:01:03,466
Sir, gas isn't going to
be inexpensive forever.

31
00:01:03,534 --> 00:01:06,002
It's not happening, guys.

32
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,172
I know you had your hopes
pinned for a promotion

33
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,573
on all this green stuff,

34
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:13,443
but this is Michigan.

35
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:15,512
It's not California.

36
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:17,514
Now, you come back
and you see me

37
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:19,582
when you remember what company
you're working for.

38
00:01:25,456 --> 00:01:27,791
Sorry to disturb
you, Mr. Dubois.

39
00:01:27,858 --> 00:01:29,592
Some calls came in
during your meeting.

40
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,361
Uh, Mr. Stiles
wants to know why

41
00:01:31,428 --> 00:01:33,129
your division
hasn't reported

42
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:34,397
on fourth quarter
sales yet.

43
00:01:34,465 --> 00:01:35,832
Well, call him back

44
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,700
and tell him we're still
crunching the numbers.

45
00:01:37,768 --> 00:01:39,402
We'll get the figures soon.

46
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,538
Your ex-wife
called, too.

47
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:43,239
Oh, great. Now,
what does she want?

48
00:01:43,307 --> 00:01:45,241
She wanted me to remind
you it's three days now

49
00:01:45,309 --> 00:01:46,743
since your son had
his most recent child.

50
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:49,012
You still haven't called
to say "congratulations."

51
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,648
Uh...

52
00:01:51,715 --> 00:01:53,216
All right, get Joe on the phone.

53
00:01:53,284 --> 00:01:55,351
Do you think this call
would have more weight

54
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:58,021
if it came
directly from you?

55
00:01:58,088 --> 00:02:00,790
I brought the number.

56
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:02,859
Uh, Joan?

57
00:02:05,062 --> 00:02:06,429
Is it a boy this time?

58
00:02:06,497 --> 00:02:07,931
A girl.

59
00:02:07,998 --> 00:02:09,766
Her name's Marie.

60
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:11,835
Oh.

61
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,942
(groaning):
Joan! Joan...!

62
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,544
Joan!

63
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:22,879
(gasps) Mr. Dubois!

64
00:02:22,947 --> 00:02:24,848
Oh! Mr. Dubois!

65
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:26,049
Help!

66
00:02:26,116 --> 00:02:27,617
Help! Someone call 911!

67
00:02:27,685 --> 00:02:29,686
(gasps)

68
00:02:31,255 --> 00:02:34,057
Yeah, it's coming up
on seven years

69
00:02:34,124 --> 00:02:35,592
since the big one.

70
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:38,027
Didn't know I was
just about to call Joe

71
00:02:38,095 --> 00:02:39,696
when it finally happened,
did you, Ally?

72
00:02:39,763 --> 00:02:41,364
No.

73
00:02:41,432 --> 00:02:43,433
What difference does it make?

74
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:47,337
You know, Marie was
your third grandchild.

75
00:02:47,404 --> 00:02:49,539
You had years to keep in touch.

76
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:51,574
Now, what do you want?

77
00:02:51,642 --> 00:02:54,177
Well, you know, Joe's not
much younger than I was

78
00:02:54,245 --> 00:02:56,045
when I had my first
heart attack.

79
00:02:56,113 --> 00:02:58,514
And he's two years older
than my father

80
00:02:58,582 --> 00:03:00,583
when he had the heart attack
that killed him.

81
00:03:00,651 --> 00:03:02,485
So?
So...

82
00:03:02,553 --> 00:03:05,889
maybe it wouldn't hurt him
to get himself checked out.

83
00:03:05,956 --> 00:03:08,491
What are you saying?

84
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:10,260
Is Joe okay?

85
00:03:10,327 --> 00:03:12,462
JOE (groggily):
Joe's fine.

86
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:14,998
He's just tired.

87
00:03:15,065 --> 00:03:17,901
Why don't you go
back to sleep now?

88
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:27,506
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

89
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:08,507
What are you saying? 
Am I gonna have a heart attack?

90
00:04:08,668 --> 00:04:10,169
No, that's not what I said.

91
00:04:10,237 --> 00:04:12,471
And that's not what he said.
He just--

92
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:15,775
Not in so many words, he
suggested that, given your age,

93
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:17,677
and your-your family history,

94
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:20,146
it might be a good idea
to get it checked out.

95
00:04:20,214 --> 00:04:22,582
No, no, no.

96
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:24,116
Look, this is what he does.

97
00:04:24,184 --> 00:04:26,052
He just shows up here
out of the blue

98
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:28,454
and says a bunch of stuff
to scare the crap out of us

99
00:04:28,522 --> 00:04:29,455
and then he disappears.

100
00:04:29,523 --> 00:04:30,890
I don't buy it
for a minute.

101
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,191
Well, I don't know.

102
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:35,461
Honey, could it really hurt
to just check it out?

103
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:38,397
I mean, you are almost the exact
same age your father was

104
00:04:38,465 --> 00:04:40,099
when he had
his first heart attack.

105
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:42,134
Yeah, but he smoked God knows
how many cigars a day

106
00:04:42,202 --> 00:04:43,936
and drank himself
to sleep every night

107
00:04:44,004 --> 00:04:45,304
with malt scotch.

108
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:47,173
I don't do any
of those things.

109
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:48,841
Besides,
I just had a physical.

110
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:51,310
Doctor said I was
in great shape,

111
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:52,845
and that was,
like, six weeks ago.

112
00:04:52,913 --> 00:04:56,182
I'm sorry. I'm not going
to run around in a panic

113
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,252
every time my dad shows up and
whispers something in your ear

114
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,920
in the wee hours
of the night.

115
00:05:00,988 --> 00:05:02,722
(light switch clicks)
Ow!

116
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:04,657
What?

117
00:05:04,725 --> 00:05:05,925
You okay?

118
00:05:05,993 --> 00:05:08,694
That-That light. It's...

119
00:05:08,762 --> 00:05:11,163
so bright.

120
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:14,000
What is going on? Did you change
the bulbs in there or something?

121
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:16,302
And you want me to see a doctor?

122
00:05:16,336 --> 00:05:18,371
Talk about the pot
calling the kettle black.

123
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:21,908
SCANLON:
Name's Levar Cole.

124
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:23,676
He's looking at a third
strike for drug possession.

125
00:05:23,744 --> 00:05:26,545
The thing is, he says he knows
something about a murder

126
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:28,414
we're investigating,
but he won't say anything else

127
00:05:28,482 --> 00:05:31,484
until we, uh,
guarantee that he'll walk

128
00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:32,718
on the possession charge.

129
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:34,086
A murder?

130
00:05:34,154 --> 00:05:37,356
Claims that Malcolm and Randy
Littleton are the killers.

131
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:39,525
The Littleton brothers?

132
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:41,727
You think he's
telling the truth?

133
00:05:41,795 --> 00:05:44,797
SCANLON:
Hard to say.

134
00:05:44,865 --> 00:05:46,732
Could just be trying to dodge
a mandatory prison sentence

135
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,668
that comes with a
third drug conviction.

136
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:49,835
But, uh, hey,
if he's willing

137
00:05:49,903 --> 00:05:51,103
to point a finger
at the Littletons,

138
00:05:51,171 --> 00:05:53,472
I figure we should,
uh, hear him out.

139
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,941
I'm sorry. Who
are the Littletons?

140
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:57,209
DEVALOS:
The city's most notorious
stick-up boys.

141
00:05:57,277 --> 00:05:59,211
They kidnap drug dealers
and then they torture them

142
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,546
until they give
up the location

143
00:06:00,614 --> 00:06:02,481
of the organization's
drug and money stash.

144
00:06:02,549 --> 00:06:04,150
Once the Littletons find
out where everything is,

145
00:06:04,217 --> 00:06:05,251
they pull a smash and grab,

146
00:06:05,285 --> 00:06:06,819
help themselves to the
drugs and the money.

147
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:08,854
Sounds like a pretty dangerous
way to make a living.

148
00:06:08,922 --> 00:06:10,156
It is.

149
00:06:10,223 --> 00:06:12,091
The Littletons are good at
it. Good enough they got

150
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:14,460
a quarter of a million dollar
bounty on each of their heads.

151
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:16,529
Not from us. From
organized crime.

152
00:06:17,764 --> 00:06:20,199
(rustling)

153
00:06:21,435 --> 00:06:22,501
You all right?

154
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:24,236
Oh, yeah.

155
00:06:24,304 --> 00:06:26,973
I just...
Maybe it's allergies.

156
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,376
I just seem to be so sensitive
to light lately.

157
00:06:30,444 --> 00:06:33,112
I'm looking for my sunglasses.

158
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,447
They're not in here.

159
00:06:34,514 --> 00:06:35,815
Hey, you know what?

160
00:06:35,882 --> 00:06:38,150
Let me check the
lost and found box.

161
00:06:44,424 --> 00:06:47,460
I saw these in
here a couple days ago.

162
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:48,861
You're welcome
to use these.

163
00:06:48,929 --> 00:06:50,196
No, thanks.
I'll just...

164
00:06:50,263 --> 00:06:52,231
Well, just keep them in
case you change your mind

165
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:55,634
because otherwise, they're
just going to sit in the box.

166
00:06:55,702 --> 00:06:59,171
I spend most of my
nights in Live Oak Park,

167
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:01,307
up where the woods
are real thick.

168
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,343
That's where I was last night
a few hours before that

169
00:07:04,411 --> 00:07:06,412
(shouts):
cop picked me up!

170
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:10,649
I was just sleeping.

171
00:07:10,717 --> 00:07:13,452
I got woke up by some noise.

172
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,255
Two men talking loud.

173
00:07:16,323 --> 00:07:19,525
It was Malcolm
and Randy Littleton.

174
00:07:19,593 --> 00:07:22,762
I could see they were--
they were digging a hole.

175
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:25,765
And I saw there was something
laying there next to them.

176
00:07:25,832 --> 00:07:27,066
A body.

177
00:07:27,134 --> 00:07:29,668
They were burying a body,

178
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:32,071
not 15 yards from
where I always sleep?

179
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:33,806
Uh-uh.

180
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:35,941
You get a look
at the victim?
No.

181
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:37,676
But if you let me walk,

182
00:07:37,744 --> 00:07:39,779
I'll tell you exactly
where that body is.

183
00:07:39,846 --> 00:07:41,013
Huh?

184
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:43,282
In fact, if you need
me to, I'll, uh,

185
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,985
I'll testify against the
Littletons in court.

186
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:49,989
You're sure these are
the two men you saw?

187
00:07:50,057 --> 00:07:52,958
I don't need pictures
to be sure.

188
00:07:53,026 --> 00:07:54,393
Where I come from,
everyone knows

189
00:07:54,461 --> 00:07:55,995
what Malcolm and Randy
Littleton look like.

190
00:07:56,063 --> 00:07:59,298
All right, Mr. Cole.
If the information

191
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:01,367
you're providing us is
accurate, I will give you

192
00:08:01,435 --> 00:08:03,969
a suspended sentence
on the drug charge.

193
00:08:04,037 --> 00:08:06,939
But any clemency is
dependent on the arrest

194
00:08:07,007 --> 00:08:09,075
and successful prosecution
of the Littletons.

195
00:08:09,142 --> 00:08:10,342
Mm-hmm.
I understand.

196
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,945
And I promise the
information's good.

197
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:15,081
In fact, I'll tell you
right where that grave is.

198
00:08:15,148 --> 00:08:18,384
You can go check
it out yourself.

199
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:20,619
(clears throat)

200
00:08:24,691 --> 00:08:26,425
So, is this man
wasting our time?

201
00:08:26,493 --> 00:08:28,994
I mean, even if he does
know where a body is,

202
00:08:29,062 --> 00:08:30,229
that doesn't
necessarily mean

203
00:08:30,297 --> 00:08:31,697
that the Littletons
put it there.

204
00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:35,234
Oh, I have no idea whether that
man is telling the truth or not.

205
00:08:35,302 --> 00:08:37,303
I mean, I saw a lot of
strange things in there.

206
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:41,040
I'm not sure they're
related to this case.

207
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:42,241
(machine beeps)
MARIE:
I'm scared.

208
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,542
Is this going to hurt?

209
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,213
BRIDGETTE: No. I don't
think so, anyway.

210
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,248
(machine beeping)
Hmm?

211
00:08:51,384 --> 00:08:54,053
According to this
machine, you're dead.

212
00:08:54,121 --> 00:08:55,421
You're not dead, sweetie.

213
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:56,755
Your arm's just too
small for that thing.

214
00:08:56,823 --> 00:08:58,023
It's just meant
for grownups.

215
00:08:58,091 --> 00:08:59,391
Come on, guys. Let's
get out of here.

216
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:00,559
I got your mom's
refills done.

217
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:01,961
Dad, you're a grownup.

218
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:03,162
So?

219
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,431
So, why don't you put
your arm in there?

220
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:06,732
Yeah, Dad.
Come on.

221
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,168
Let's do this.

222
00:09:09,236 --> 00:09:11,070
BRIDGETTE:
So, are you going to do it?

223
00:09:11,138 --> 00:09:14,607
Sure. Why not?

224
00:09:14,674 --> 00:09:18,144
I bet Dad's rating
doesn't come back "dead."

225
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,250
Okay.

226
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:27,520
(machine whirring)

227
00:09:27,587 --> 00:09:29,221
(beeping)

228
00:09:34,161 --> 00:09:35,261
Dad...

229
00:09:35,328 --> 00:09:37,196
this machine says that
your blood pressure

230
00:09:37,264 --> 00:09:38,931
is at borderline risk.

231
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:40,533
What does that mean?

232
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,102
Risk for what?

233
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,671
(phone ringing)

234
00:09:50,043 --> 00:09:51,443
(mutters)

235
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:59,218
Anything for the inter-office
mail, Ms. Dubois?

236
00:09:59,286 --> 00:10:01,720
You okay?

237
00:10:01,788 --> 00:10:03,622
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine, Doug.

238
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,657
(chuckles nervously)

239
00:10:04,724 --> 00:10:06,592
Um...
Thanks.

240
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,328
No, I-I'm fine
for office mail today.

241
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:11,664
(chuckles)

242
00:10:18,004 --> 00:10:19,171
DEVALOS:
Allison.

243
00:10:20,507 --> 00:10:21,640
Your eyes still
bothering you?

244
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,576
The glasses are helping.

245
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:25,377
I just got off
the phone with Lee.

246
00:10:25,445 --> 00:10:27,780
Apparently, Levar Cole
was telling us the truth,

247
00:10:27,847 --> 00:10:29,181
at least about one thing.

248
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:31,383
They did find a body buried
out in Live Oak Park,

249
00:10:31,451 --> 00:10:33,085
and it was right where
he said it would be.

250
00:10:33,153 --> 00:10:35,187
I'm on my way over
to the morgue.

251
00:10:35,255 --> 00:10:37,256
Can I hitch a ride?

252
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,726
We ID'd the body.

253
00:10:40,794 --> 00:10:43,262
Low-level drug dealer
named Juan Espinal.

254
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,465
Best guess? The Littleton
brothers got a hold of him.

255
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:48,834
Tried to shake him down
for inside scoop

256
00:10:48,902 --> 00:10:50,402
on the people he worked for.

257
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,537
Maybe he didn't
cooperate.

258
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:53,205
Maybe the Littletons
didn't like

259
00:10:53,273 --> 00:10:54,707
what he had to say.

260
00:10:54,774 --> 00:10:57,042
Either way,
he ended up here.

261
00:11:02,182 --> 00:11:03,649
What's with the hairnet?

262
00:11:03,717 --> 00:11:05,951
That was there when
we dug him up.

263
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:08,654
I don't know.
Fashion, I guess.

264
00:11:08,722 --> 00:11:10,322
Allison, what are you doing?

265
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:14,326
ALLISON:
Zero.

266
00:11:14,394 --> 00:11:17,196
He's dead. He's got zero days
left to live.

267
00:11:17,264 --> 00:11:18,864
I beg your pardon?

268
00:11:18,932 --> 00:11:20,065
Oh, my God.

269
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:21,834
That man we interviewed--

270
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:24,136
the one who said he
would testify against
the Littleton brothers.

271
00:11:24,204 --> 00:11:25,571
Levar Cole.
What about him?

272
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,339
His number was one.

273
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:29,174
I don't follow.

274
00:11:29,242 --> 00:11:31,043
You have to make sure
that man is safe.

275
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:32,378
Levar Cole's in county,
pending release.

276
00:11:32,445 --> 00:11:33,679
He's not going anywhere.

277
00:11:33,747 --> 00:11:35,981
I'm not worried about
him getting away.

278
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:38,083
I'm worried something is going
to happen to him.

279
00:11:38,151 --> 00:11:40,185
Please, you have to make sure
that he's safe.

280
00:11:40,253 --> 00:11:42,187
(cell phone dialing)

281
00:11:44,224 --> 00:11:45,991
Yeah, uh,
this is Detective Scanlon.

282
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:48,027
I'm calling in regards
to a Levar Cole.

283
00:11:48,094 --> 00:11:50,229
I'm coming in to process
his release later today.

284
00:11:50,297 --> 00:11:53,165
I just want to make sure
everything's all set.

285
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:01,807
What?

286
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,610
What'd they say?

287
00:12:04,678 --> 00:12:06,912
Just happened
20 minutes ago.

288
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,348
A fight broke out
in the prison cafeteria.

289
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,984
Levar Cole was stabbed
with a shiv.

290
00:12:12,052 --> 00:12:13,786
He's dead.

291
00:12:21,837 --> 00:12:23,204
JOE:
Al, are you in there?

292
00:12:23,272 --> 00:12:25,673
(gasps)

293
00:12:25,941 --> 00:12:27,608
Don't turn the light on.

294
00:12:27,676 --> 00:12:29,977
And close the door, please.

295
00:12:31,947 --> 00:12:35,850
Al, I think it's time
we get you to a doctor.

296
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:37,284
I mean, if this is bad enough

297
00:12:37,352 --> 00:12:39,420
that I have to come get
you from work...

298
00:12:39,488 --> 00:12:42,890
Honey, I don't even know
what I would say to the
doctor at this point.

299
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,159
And that's not even
the worst of it.

300
00:12:45,227 --> 00:12:46,927
Just get me in the elevator.

301
00:12:46,995 --> 00:12:48,863
Get me outside
into the darkness.

302
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,332
And then I'll tell
you everything.

303
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,235
The days that a person
has left to live?

304
00:12:54,336 --> 00:12:55,836
That's a pretty
dramatic statement.

305
00:12:55,904 --> 00:12:58,172
Yeah, but I'm telling you,
I think I'm right.

306
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,175
I mean, at first when I put
these sunglasses on,

307
00:13:01,243 --> 00:13:04,445
and I looked at people,
I could see these five-digit
numbers floating around

308
00:13:04,513 --> 00:13:06,080
on their foreheads.

309
00:13:06,148 --> 00:13:08,215
Devalos, Scanlon.

310
00:13:08,283 --> 00:13:10,084
Later when we were
at the morgue,

311
00:13:10,152 --> 00:13:12,953
all the corpses--
they all had zeros.

312
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:16,724
I know it sounds crazy,
but I can't make sense of it,

313
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:18,125
but there it is.

314
00:13:18,193 --> 00:13:21,662
You telling me that if you look
at me through those glasses,

315
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,165
you can tell me how long
I have left to live?

316
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:25,833
Don't ask me to do that.

317
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:29,036
Well, aren't you the person
who's saying my dead father's

318
00:13:29,104 --> 00:13:31,439
raising all these
questions about my health?

319
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:32,606
Yeah, but...

320
00:13:32,674 --> 00:13:33,908
But what?

321
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:36,110
Yeah, but I don't
want to know that.

322
00:13:36,178 --> 00:13:38,345
I mean... not like that.

323
00:13:38,413 --> 00:13:40,314
If you think about it
for a second,

324
00:13:40,382 --> 00:13:41,982
you don't either.

325
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:47,888
Do you know who we are?

326
00:13:50,692 --> 00:13:53,994
Do you know
why you're here?

327
00:13:54,062 --> 00:13:56,330
Good.

328
00:13:56,398 --> 00:13:58,065
So you know how
important it is

329
00:13:58,133 --> 00:14:00,701
for you to answer the questions
that we're about to ask you.

330
00:14:03,872 --> 00:14:05,773
Juan Espinal.

331
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:08,676
You deal smack
for Hector Becerra.

332
00:14:08,744 --> 00:14:12,113
In fact, you're his top-earning
corner boy, am I right?

333
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,548
Yeah, that's right.

334
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:18,385
So now that we
all know each other, Juan,

335
00:14:18,453 --> 00:14:20,921
I want you to tell
me and my brother here

336
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:23,124
all about Hector's
stash houses.

337
00:14:23,191 --> 00:14:24,492
The ones on the east side.

338
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,962
Come on, man,
you know I can't do that.

339
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:30,231
Juan...

340
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:31,766
Juan.

341
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,968
I thought you said you
knew who we were.

342
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:37,638
Look, I-I know you guys
is for real,

343
00:14:37,706 --> 00:14:39,774
but if I tell you about
them stash houses,

344
00:14:39,841 --> 00:14:41,475
my own people  will kill me.

345
00:14:41,543 --> 00:14:44,612
Ain't nobody got to know
it was you.

346
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:48,449
Come on, look, my brother
Randy, he don't talk much.

347
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:51,318
And I ain't gonna
tell nobody.

348
00:14:53,989 --> 00:14:55,156
Juan...

349
00:14:55,223 --> 00:14:59,160
Come on now.

350
00:14:59,227 --> 00:15:00,394
You know you gonna tell us

351
00:15:00,462 --> 00:15:02,730
everything we want
to know, right?

352
00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:04,532
Right?

353
00:15:09,371 --> 00:15:10,504
Come here.

354
00:15:10,572 --> 00:15:12,273
(muffled sobbing)

355
00:15:14,342 --> 00:15:19,580
Okay, Juan, we're gonna see
just how long you can hold out.

356
00:15:25,287 --> 00:15:27,188
(screaming)

357
00:15:30,091 --> 00:15:32,026
<i>DEVALOS:
Unfortunately, what you saw</i>

358
00:15:32,093 --> 00:15:34,228
in your dream actually makes a
lot of sense.

359
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:36,664
A couple of Hector Becerra's
stash houses

360
00:15:36,731 --> 00:15:37,798
were robbed last week.

361
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:40,401
Not to mention
the coroner pointed out

362
00:15:40,468 --> 00:15:43,070
a fresh wound on
Juan Espinal's right bicep.

363
00:15:43,138 --> 00:15:46,173
It certainly could have been
inflicted by a sander.

364
00:15:46,241 --> 00:15:47,875
Well, I don't understand.

365
00:15:47,943 --> 00:15:49,009
I read the Littletons' file.

366
00:15:49,077 --> 00:15:50,978
I thought they operated
by some kind of code

367
00:15:51,046 --> 00:15:53,781
where they'd kidnap someone,
and if that person gave

368
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:55,516
them good information,
they'd let them go.

369
00:15:55,584 --> 00:15:59,920
If Juan Espinal talked--
if he told them the location

370
00:15:59,988 --> 00:16:02,590
of the stash houses--
why would they kill him?

371
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:05,793
Maybe the Littletons are
playing by a new set of rules.

372
00:16:05,861 --> 00:16:07,695
No witnesses.

373
00:16:07,762 --> 00:16:13,000
In any case, I'm going to
go canvas the city for
abandoned barbershops.

374
00:16:13,068 --> 00:16:15,569
If that's where the brothers
tortured and killed

375
00:16:15,637 --> 00:16:18,706
Juan Espinal, maybe I can
find some evidence to tie
them to the crime.

376
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:21,342
Keep us posted.

377
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:24,044
You know, yesterday,
you wouldn't even
put those things on.

378
00:16:24,112 --> 00:16:27,047
Now it's like
they're glued to you.

379
00:16:27,115 --> 00:16:29,316
Yeah. Yeah, it looks that way.

380
00:16:31,586 --> 00:16:33,520
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Paging Dr. Bender, please.

381
00:16:33,588 --> 00:16:35,422
Well, it's a little elevated,

382
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,024
but blood pressure
varies day to day.

383
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,859
I don't think it's anything
to be alarmed about.

384
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:40,127
I'm okay?

385
00:16:40,195 --> 00:16:42,129
Hey, based on my family history,

386
00:16:42,197 --> 00:16:45,733
is there anything that I should
be doing to avoid heart trouble?

387
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,534
It's a lot about
life choices, Joe.

388
00:16:47,602 --> 00:16:50,037
I mean, the good news is
you don't smoke,

389
00:16:50,105 --> 00:16:51,972
you're at your ideal weight,
married, employed.

390
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,875
d say
you're doing great.

391
00:16:54,943 --> 00:16:57,311
Do you have any
undue stress in your life?

392
00:16:57,412 --> 00:16:58,913
You mentioned your wife
had been ill.

393
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,347
Yeah, but she's doing
great now.

394
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,349
Um, I mean, I just started
a new job.

395
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:04,084
I guess that probably
added some stress.

396
00:17:04,152 --> 00:17:06,520
Well, I mean, there
is another thing

397
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:08,289
that can make a
major difference

398
00:17:08,356 --> 00:17:09,890
in stress and
blood pressure levels.

399
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,693
Particularly for people
with stressful jobs.

400
00:17:12,761 --> 00:17:16,063
You ever tried meditation?

401
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:19,066
What do you mean,
like chanting?

402
00:17:19,134 --> 00:17:21,468
No, not necessarily, anyway.

403
00:17:21,536 --> 00:17:24,805
You set aside some chunks
of time during the day.

404
00:17:24,873 --> 00:17:26,807
Focus on your breathing,
clear your mind.

405
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,276
Just try to stay totally
present in the moment.

406
00:17:29,344 --> 00:17:32,413
(chuckles)
I know what
you're thinking.

407
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,881
I was right there with you.

408
00:17:33,949 --> 00:17:37,518
Believe me, I'm no hippie,
but I gave it a shot.

409
00:17:37,585 --> 00:17:39,553
It really helps.

410
00:18:11,086 --> 00:18:13,153
(phone ringing)

411
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:14,355
Hello.

412
00:18:14,422 --> 00:18:16,256
Allison, it's Manuel.

413
00:18:16,324 --> 00:18:18,025
I'm going to give you
an address.

414
00:18:18,093 --> 00:18:19,793
I need you to come
right over here.

415
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:21,462
Mr. District Attorney,
what's going on?

416
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:23,564
Lee found that barbershop
you saw in your dream.

417
00:18:23,631 --> 00:18:26,000
He crossed paths with one
of the Littleton brothers.

418
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:27,968
Lee shot him.

419
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:30,037
(siren wailing)

420
00:18:43,418 --> 00:18:45,219
Allison, thanks
for coming.

421
00:18:45,286 --> 00:18:47,021
I came as quick
as I could.

422
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,991
Have you
seen Lee yet?

423
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:52,126
No, where is he?

424
00:18:52,193 --> 00:18:54,061
He's out back, I think,

425
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:56,463
filing a statement
with Internal Affairs.

426
00:18:56,531 --> 00:18:57,531
I don't understand.

427
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,699
What was Littleton
doing here?

428
00:18:58,767 --> 00:18:59,967
Why were shots even fired?

429
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:02,669
Apparently, Lee pulled up
to take a look around

430
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:05,472
just as Littleton here
was in the process of leaving.

431
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,975
Lee got out of his car,
identified himself

432
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:09,643
and Randy went for his gun.

433
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:12,046
We've already found
weapons, drugs.

434
00:19:12,113 --> 00:19:15,215
Apparently they were
using this place

435
00:19:15,283 --> 00:19:17,151
as a kind of base of operations.

436
00:19:17,218 --> 00:19:18,318
Is Lee all right?

437
00:19:18,386 --> 00:19:19,820
Not a mark on him.

438
00:19:19,888 --> 00:19:22,623
Any signs of the other
Littleton brother?

439
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,791
No.

440
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:25,459
But with Randy dead,
I have a feeling

441
00:19:25,527 --> 00:19:27,027
that Malcolm might try
to retaliate soon.

442
00:19:27,095 --> 00:19:28,095
What do you
mean retaliate?

443
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:29,263
SCANLON:
I hope you two didn't come

444
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,697
all the way down
here on my account.

445
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:33,033
I'm touched.

446
00:19:33,101 --> 00:19:34,435
Oh, my God.

447
00:19:34,502 --> 00:19:35,502
Lee...

448
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,471
It's okay, Allison, I'm fine.

449
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:40,040
Really, there's not
a scratch on me.

450
00:19:45,795 --> 00:19:46,795
Gee, two days to live, huh?

451
00:19:46,862 --> 00:19:48,496
I don't know what
to tell you, Allison.

452
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:50,999
If you could see your way
clear to give me a week,

453
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:53,702
maybe I'd cash in my 401K,
take a trip to Maui, but...

454
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:55,437
Lee...
...given the scheduling
crunch...

455
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:57,272
Lee, I need you
to listen to me.

456
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,473
I'm serious.

457
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,941
I mean, think about it.

458
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:02,310
Randy Littleton is dead, and his
brother is still out there.

459
00:20:02,378 --> 00:20:04,679
He's going to want to get
the man who did this.

460
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:05,947
He's going to want
to get revenge.

461
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:09,084
Don't do that.
Don't just shrug.

462
00:20:09,151 --> 00:20:11,386
Think about Lynn.
Think about the baby.

463
00:20:11,454 --> 00:20:12,620
All right, I'm thinking
about them.

464
00:20:12,688 --> 00:20:14,589
Now what is it you want
me to do? I'm a cop.

465
00:20:14,657 --> 00:20:17,025
Every day I go out there,
I try to put away a bad guy.

466
00:20:17,093 --> 00:20:18,226
Knowing that I could be
ticking off

467
00:20:18,294 --> 00:20:19,461
another bad guy in the process.

468
00:20:19,528 --> 00:20:20,628
That's just part of the job.

469
00:20:20,696 --> 00:20:22,564
And besides, all
you're seeing is a number.

470
00:20:22,631 --> 00:20:24,733
It's not like it's telling
you something specific

471
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,735
that I can prepare for
or guard against.

472
00:20:26,802 --> 00:20:28,670
And for all you know,
it could be that I slip

473
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:30,238
in the shower tomorrow
and crack my skull open.

474
00:20:30,306 --> 00:20:31,740
I don't think so.

475
00:20:31,807 --> 00:20:34,843
Look, the bottom line is, if I
want to avoid being murdered

476
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,411
by Malcolm Littleton,
than my best option

477
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,414
is to work the case and try to
make sure that we find him

478
00:20:39,482 --> 00:20:41,116
and put him away
as soon as possible.

479
00:20:41,183 --> 00:20:43,952
Besides, it's not like
I'm flying blind.

480
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:46,988
I found this on Randy Littleton.

481
00:20:47,056 --> 00:20:48,556
Now this guy
and his brother

482
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:50,325
they tracked every drug
dealer in Phoenix

483
00:20:50,393 --> 00:20:51,593
at one time or another.

484
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,228
And it's all written down
right here.

485
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:55,563
This book's going to be
worth a lot to someone.

486
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,465
And I can use this
to find Malcolm.

487
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:02,103
Or I could just
stay home from work.

488
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:06,174
Not take a shower,
not get out of bed.

489
00:21:06,242 --> 00:21:07,609
Help me out with this one,
Allison.

490
00:21:07,676 --> 00:21:09,277
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo?

491
00:21:17,787 --> 00:21:19,687
(sighs)

492
00:21:28,898 --> 00:21:31,166
(door opening)

493
00:21:33,469 --> 00:21:34,736
Is this gonna bother you?

494
00:21:34,804 --> 00:21:36,204
I can read outside
if you'd like.

495
00:21:36,272 --> 00:21:37,539
No, it's fine.

496
00:21:37,606 --> 00:21:39,707
I'm just gonna
shut my eyes anyway.

497
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:47,849
Ugh, who am I kidding?

498
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:50,785
Okay, I'll go read
in the living room.

499
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:52,220
Wait, no, honey,
it's not the light.

500
00:21:52,288 --> 00:21:53,955
It's Lee.

501
00:21:54,023 --> 00:21:57,125
He's running out of time and I
don't know what to do about it.

502
00:21:57,193 --> 00:21:59,661
Well, I don't know that
there's anything to do.

503
00:21:59,728 --> 00:22:01,496
And I also don't know that

504
00:22:01,564 --> 00:22:03,765
you're absolutely
running out of time.

505
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,600
I don't know how
you can be saying that.

506
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:06,901
Well, think about it.

507
00:22:06,969 --> 00:22:09,304
Okay, so, yesterday
you look through your glasses

508
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,840
and he had however many
thousands of days left.

509
00:22:11,907 --> 00:22:14,843
Today your glasses
tell you it's only two.

510
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,377
So, clearly, things can change.

511
00:22:16,445 --> 00:22:18,146
Tomorrow's a new day--
who knows

512
00:22:18,214 --> 00:22:19,647
what your glasses
are gonna tell you?

513
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:22,617
And if the police catch
this Littleton guy,

514
00:22:22,685 --> 00:22:24,752
then it kind of
stands to reason

515
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,889
that Scanlon's number's
gonna shoot right back up
to where it was before.

516
00:22:27,957 --> 00:22:29,557
Well, what if
they don't catch him?

517
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:32,727
Well, then, then we just
gotta deal with that.

518
00:22:32,795 --> 00:22:35,597
The point is you can't actually
know what these numbers

519
00:22:35,664 --> 00:22:37,999
are gonna be tomorrow until
tomorrow actually gets here.

520
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:41,836
That's very Zen of you.
And I'm only on chapter one.

521
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:43,905
How do you feel?

522
00:22:43,973 --> 00:22:45,640
The whole thing
makes me nervous.

523
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,675
I gotta sit there
and do nothing?

524
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:50,278
Call me crazy;
I don't find that relaxing.

525
00:22:50,346 --> 00:22:52,080
Well, honey, it's like anything.

526
00:22:52,147 --> 00:22:55,917
You just gotta do it a few times
before you get the hang of it.

527
00:22:55,985 --> 00:22:58,386
Yeah, the book says I gotta
do it three times a day.

528
00:22:58,454 --> 00:23:01,990
That means I gotta go meditate
in the middle of work.

529
00:23:02,057 --> 00:23:03,424
I'm just not the kind of guy

530
00:23:03,492 --> 00:23:05,793
that's gonna turn
to my colleagues

531
00:23:05,861 --> 00:23:09,664
and say, "Excuse me, but, uh,
I'll be back in ten minutes.

532
00:23:09,732 --> 00:23:13,067
"I just gotta go seeking
enlightenment now."

533
00:23:13,135 --> 00:23:14,602
Relax.

534
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,104
You don't need enlightenment.

535
00:23:16,171 --> 00:23:18,706
You just need to lower
your blood pressure.

536
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:25,713
(car horn honking)

537
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:27,582
MAN:
Hey, yo, Juan!

538
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,017
Hey.

539
00:23:33,188 --> 00:23:34,622
What's up?
What's up, man?

540
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:35,690
You good?
Yeah.

541
00:23:35,758 --> 00:23:37,458
I've been looking
for you, man.

542
00:23:37,526 --> 00:23:40,295
Hector sent me to
come and get you.
Oh, yeah,
what's Hector want?

543
00:23:40,362 --> 00:23:41,896
Ah, he just wants
to talk to you

544
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:43,765
about the Littleton boys
hitting up our stash houses.

545
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:45,333
You kidding me?

546
00:23:45,401 --> 00:23:47,035
I don't know anything
about that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

547
00:23:47,102 --> 00:23:48,970
But you know Hector, man,
he'd feel a lot better

548
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:50,805
if he heard that
right from you.
Yeah.

549
00:23:50,873 --> 00:23:53,308
Why don't you get in the car,
homie? We'll go see him.

550
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:56,077
Man, I gotta be out
on my corner, man, you know.
Corner...

551
00:23:56,145 --> 00:23:58,346
Customers expect me, I mean,
how else am I gonna sell?

552
00:23:58,414 --> 00:24:00,548
You know Hector would rather
have me out there earning

553
00:24:00,616 --> 00:24:02,183
than wasting my time
coming to see him.

554
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:03,618
Oh, for sure, yeah.

555
00:24:03,686 --> 00:24:05,086
See, the problem is though,

556
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:07,355
Hector knows that you are not
always on that corner, right?

557
00:24:07,423 --> 00:24:10,291
'Cause the other day,
in fact, you weren't selling.

558
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:12,594
I mean, nobody knew
where you were.

559
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:15,163
Cesar, I was sick,
man, come on.
Sick.

560
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,031
Ain't you ever
had to take a sick day?

561
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:19,467
Sick? Look, man.

562
00:24:19,535 --> 00:24:21,202
You know who don't
ever take sick days?

563
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,504
The Littleton brothers
don't ever take sick days

564
00:24:23,572 --> 00:24:26,841
because they're always
working, man, always.

565
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:29,544
Even when nobody could find you,
the Littletons were working.

566
00:24:29,612 --> 00:24:32,146
I already told you, I don't know
anything about the Littletons.

567
00:24:32,214 --> 00:24:35,149
Come on, man, you know
something, right, hmm?

568
00:24:35,217 --> 00:24:36,851
You heard the stories.

569
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:39,487
They kidnap you,
they tie you up,

570
00:24:39,555 --> 00:24:42,357
ask you questions
and when you can't answer...

571
00:24:42,424 --> 00:24:43,858
They break out that belt sander,

572
00:24:43,926 --> 00:24:47,495
just grind, man,
tear that meat out.

573
00:24:47,563 --> 00:24:51,032
The way I hear,
they start with your arm.

574
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,501
Right about here.

575
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:56,070
(groaning)
Huh, is that it?

576
00:25:00,142 --> 00:25:02,010
Get him!

577
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:29,003
¶ ¶

578
00:25:38,147 --> 00:25:40,348
(sighing)

579
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:42,016
Looks like it's about that time.

580
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,885
Some of us are grabbing pizza
for lunch.

581
00:25:43,952 --> 00:25:45,253
You wanna come with?

582
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,587
No, thanks, man. I'm...

583
00:25:46,655 --> 00:25:48,122
I'm brown-bagging it today.

584
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,624
No worries, man.

585
00:25:49,692 --> 00:25:50,892
See you in a bit.

586
00:26:20,456 --> 00:26:22,790
Okay.

587
00:26:22,858 --> 00:26:25,326
All right, ouch.

588
00:26:25,427 --> 00:26:27,662
Okay, here goes nothing.

589
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:31,766
(sighs)

590
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:34,836
Om...

591
00:26:36,171 --> 00:26:38,806
Om...

592
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:42,910
Om...
Uh, you're sitting in my spot.

593
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:45,346
Say again?

594
00:26:45,414 --> 00:26:47,281
You're sitting in my spot.

595
00:26:49,284 --> 00:26:51,753
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
Were you...

596
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,288
Were you meditating?
It was hard to tell,
but now I'm thinking

597
00:26:54,356 --> 00:26:56,090
maybe you were meditating.
Oh, no, yeah.

598
00:26:56,158 --> 00:26:57,925
No, no, I, I just...

599
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:00,094
I don't know, I guess
I was just looking for,

600
00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:01,896
uh, you know, a quiet
place to sit for a while.

601
00:27:01,964 --> 00:27:03,231
Well, you found
the right place.

602
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:04,966
I come out here almost
every day right before lunch.

603
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:05,967
Oh, yeah?

604
00:27:06,034 --> 00:27:07,502
You work here?
Yeah.

605
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:09,737
Uh, Joe Dubois.

606
00:27:09,805 --> 00:27:11,706
Dan Burroughs.

607
00:27:13,442 --> 00:27:15,943
Dan Burroughs, as in...

608
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:17,578
Burroughs and Strauss?

609
00:27:17,646 --> 00:27:20,481
Yeah.
You're my boss.

610
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:23,885
And I was, uh...

611
00:27:23,952 --> 00:27:25,520
Yeah, I was sitting
in your lunch spot.

612
00:27:25,587 --> 00:27:28,156
Um, I lied.

613
00:27:28,223 --> 00:27:31,025
My name is not Joe Dubois,
and I do not work over there.

614
00:27:31,093 --> 00:27:33,127
Listen, it's all right,
it's a public place.

615
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:34,529
I'll go someplace else.
No.

616
00:27:34,596 --> 00:27:35,930
No, no, you go ahead

617
00:27:35,998 --> 00:27:37,498
and do whatever
you're doing, I guess.

618
00:27:37,566 --> 00:27:40,168
It's all right.

619
00:27:40,235 --> 00:27:42,236
(sighs)

620
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,177
<i>SCANLON:
You've reached the cell phone</i>

621
00:27:49,244 --> 00:27:50,178
of Detective Lee Scanlon.

622
00:27:50,245 --> 00:27:52,780
If this is an emergency,
dial 9-1-1.

623
00:27:52,848 --> 00:27:54,982
If not, leave a message
after the beep.

624
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,717
(beeping)
Uh, hey, hey.

625
00:27:56,785 --> 00:27:57,985
Lee, it's Allison.

626
00:27:58,053 --> 00:28:00,254
I've been trying to get
a hold of you all day.

627
00:28:00,322 --> 00:28:02,523
I guess we're just not destined
to run into one another.

628
00:28:02,591 --> 00:28:03,958
So, here's the thing.

629
00:28:04,026 --> 00:28:05,626
I'm not sure that Juan Espinal

630
00:28:05,694 --> 00:28:08,162
was killed by the Littletons
at all.

631
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,431
Uh, it seems that
the people that he worked for

632
00:28:10,499 --> 00:28:11,899
had it in for him, too.

633
00:28:11,967 --> 00:28:16,737
Oh, and, uh, I'm not sure
that this matters or not,

634
00:28:16,805 --> 00:28:19,674
but you know those sunglasses
I've been wearing?

635
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,876
I think they actually
belonged to Espinal.

636
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,712
I have no idea why
or how they made their way

637
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,515
into the lost and found
at the police station, but...

638
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,917
I think they were actually his.

639
00:28:29,985 --> 00:28:32,220
Hey, when you get this
can you give me a call?

640
00:28:32,287 --> 00:28:33,921
'Cause I'm just
worried about you.

641
00:28:33,989 --> 00:28:35,923
And I wanna make sure
you're all right.

642
00:28:35,991 --> 00:28:38,159
DEVALOS:
Allison.

643
00:28:38,193 --> 00:28:40,428
Forward your calls; I think
you're gonna want to join me.

644
00:28:40,495 --> 00:28:42,630
Where are we going?
The morgue.

645
00:28:43,665 --> 00:28:45,633
DEVALOS:
Malcolm Littleton.

646
00:28:45,701 --> 00:28:48,302
He was found lying
on the sidewalk

647
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,838
at the corner of Blossom and
Sycamore at 6:00 this morning.

648
00:28:50,906 --> 00:28:52,106
Nobody touched the body,

649
00:28:52,174 --> 00:28:54,041
even though it had
been there for hours.

650
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:57,345
And near as we can determine,
there were no eyewitnesses.

651
00:28:57,412 --> 00:28:58,512
And you believe that?

652
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,249
I'd be surprised if
anyone came forward.

653
00:29:01,316 --> 00:29:03,551
Littleton robbed
dozens of drug dealers.

654
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:05,253
It's not a stretch
to imagine that

655
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,021
one of them finally
caught up with him.

656
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:08,656
Even if someone
did see something,

657
00:29:08,724 --> 00:29:11,225
I doubt that anyone would
testify against drug dealers

658
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:13,761
in an open court for the
likes of Malcolm Littleton.

659
00:29:13,829 --> 00:29:15,863
(door opening)

660
00:29:15,931 --> 00:29:19,000
I guess somebody caught up
with Malcolm before I could.

661
00:29:19,067 --> 00:29:20,501
Just heard the news
on the radio.

662
00:29:22,704 --> 00:29:25,473
Gotta be good news for
my prognosis though, right?

663
00:29:37,674 --> 00:29:39,974
You want some sun tan lotion
 for your back?

664
00:29:40,854 --> 00:29:42,688
Oh, don't make fun.

665
00:29:42,756 --> 00:29:45,424
It's nice out here, and I don't
have to wear my sunglasses.

666
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:48,327
I can just... I can just be.

667
00:29:48,395 --> 00:29:50,529
Hmm, boy, I envy

668
00:29:50,597 --> 00:29:53,332
your sense of contentment.

669
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,068
I, on the other hand,
am filled with angst...

670
00:29:56,136 --> 00:29:58,504
knowing that I made a complete
imbecile out of myself

671
00:29:58,572 --> 00:30:01,307
in front of the man who owns
the company that I work for.

672
00:30:01,374 --> 00:30:03,375
By the way,
I'm changing doctors.

673
00:30:03,443 --> 00:30:05,377
And I hate my father.

674
00:30:05,445 --> 00:30:06,879
And how are you?

675
00:30:06,947 --> 00:30:09,348
You know, you're really making a
mountain out of a molehill here.

676
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:11,584
How do you know Burroughs
even cares if you meditate

677
00:30:11,651 --> 00:30:13,986
during your lunch hour?
I don't know.

678
00:30:14,054 --> 00:30:15,654
Maybe he doesn't.

679
00:30:15,722 --> 00:30:17,556
I just worry that
for the rest of time

680
00:30:17,624 --> 00:30:19,425
he's gonna think of me
as that odd fellow

681
00:30:19,492 --> 00:30:23,996
who was dithering
in his spot during lunch.

682
00:30:24,064 --> 00:30:26,799
Are you expecting
an urgent call?

683
00:30:29,402 --> 00:30:32,071
The Scanlon hotline?

684
00:30:32,138 --> 00:30:33,606
I hate this.

685
00:30:33,673 --> 00:30:35,074
Stupid sunglasses.

686
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:36,642
They don't tell you
what's gonna happen,

687
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,711
only when it's almost here.

688
00:30:38,778 --> 00:30:40,412
I don't get it.

689
00:30:40,513 --> 00:30:41,881
Both of the Littleton brothers
are dead.

690
00:30:41,948 --> 00:30:43,549
Why does Lee still
have a number one

691
00:30:43,617 --> 00:30:44,850
floating around his forehead?

692
00:30:44,918 --> 00:30:48,487
Well, you can only control
what you can control.

693
00:30:50,991 --> 00:30:53,559
At least I convinced him
not to come in to work tomorrow.

694
00:30:53,627 --> 00:30:56,695
He's gonna take the day off.

695
00:30:56,763 --> 00:30:59,064
I don't know,
maybe that'll make a difference.

696
00:30:59,132 --> 00:31:00,799
Who knows? I guess we'll see.

697
00:31:00,867 --> 00:31:02,401
Well, speaking of tomorrow,

698
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:05,237
what do you say
we call it a day?

699
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,176
(chuckling)

700
00:31:13,013 --> 00:31:14,947
(siren wailing)

701
00:31:15,015 --> 00:31:17,516
¶ ¶

702
00:31:19,452 --> 00:31:20,953
You Juan?

703
00:31:21,021 --> 00:31:24,323
What, you don't remember me?

704
00:31:24,391 --> 00:31:26,792
You arrested me twice
for possession with intent.

705
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,828
I arrest a lot of people, Juan.

706
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:32,298
I got a message you wanted
to talk to me. What's up?

707
00:31:32,365 --> 00:31:33,666
I'm in trouble.

708
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:35,501
The people I work for,
they, they think

709
00:31:35,568 --> 00:31:37,036
I gave them up
to the Littletons.

710
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,771
I can't go home;
I can't go anywhere.

711
00:31:38,838 --> 00:31:40,572
So I'm coming to you,
maybe we can work a deal.

712
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,174
I'll give you information
on my people.

713
00:31:42,242 --> 00:31:44,243
I'll even tell you what
I know about the Littletons.

714
00:31:44,311 --> 00:31:48,714
As long as you can
promise me protection.

715
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,749
Sounds like we got
a lot to talk about.

716
00:31:50,817 --> 00:31:52,384
Why don't you get in?

717
00:31:58,158 --> 00:32:01,360
Just give me a second, Juan.

718
00:32:01,428 --> 00:32:03,762
I gotta make a call to
one of my colleagues.

719
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,665
Yeah, Detective Carver here.

720
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:09,301
I have Juan Espinal
with me right now.

721
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:11,837
Yeah, no, the
message was right.

722
00:32:11,905 --> 00:32:13,205
He wants to talk.

723
00:32:13,273 --> 00:32:16,842
He'll give us Becerra,
the Littletons, everybody.

724
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,912
I'm bringing him
in right now.

725
00:32:25,085 --> 00:32:28,921
We'll take your statement
when we get to the precinct.

726
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:34,259
So, did you?

727
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:39,531
Did you give up information
to the Littleton brothers?

728
00:32:41,735 --> 00:32:45,437
Hey... they came at me
with a sander, man.

729
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,673
I don't get paid enough to deal
with that.

730
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,752
Where we going, anyway?

731
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:03,355
I just gotta make a quick stop,
pick someone up.

732
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:18,103
(muffled groaning)

733
00:33:20,507 --> 00:33:22,241
(muffled gasp)

734
00:33:22,308 --> 00:33:24,910
(phone rings)

735
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:33,752
(knock at door)

736
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,087
Just a minute!
(hangs up)

737
00:33:42,162 --> 00:33:43,796
(sighs)

738
00:33:45,298 --> 00:33:47,733
Hey, Lee, uh, sorry
to bother you at home.

739
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:49,368
I know you-you got a kid now,

740
00:33:49,436 --> 00:33:51,303
but dispatch said you
weren't coming in?

741
00:33:51,371 --> 00:33:53,672
that's okay.
Uh, the baby's with her mom.

742
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,307
Come on in.

743
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:57,342
(ringing resumes)

744
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,578
Listen, uh, I'll
get right to it.
(hangs up)

745
00:33:59,646 --> 00:34:01,847
I read the report about the
Randy Littleton shooting,

746
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,316
and it said you, uh, pulled
a notebook off the body?

747
00:34:04,384 --> 00:34:06,251
Yeah, that's right.

748
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,686
Well, I got to tell you,

749
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,656
as the head of
the anti-gang task force,

750
00:34:10,723 --> 00:34:14,426
uh... that thing is like the
Rosetta Stone of gang activity

751
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:18,263
here in Phoenix.

752
00:34:18,331 --> 00:34:19,264
d,"... that thing is like the
RosettaIt's not there.activity

753
00:34:19,332 --> 00:34:20,766
(ringing resumes)

754
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:22,734
You need to get that?
(hangs up)

755
00:34:22,802 --> 00:34:24,770
I can ca her right back.

756
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:27,539
Uh, yeah, I do have that, uh,
that notebook here somewhere.

757
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,142
I was gonna go through it one
more time and, uh...

758
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:33,679
make a list of initials, names,
basically anyone I can question.

759
00:34:33,746 --> 00:34:35,514
Question about what?

760
00:34:35,582 --> 00:34:37,483
Malcolm Littleton's murder.

761
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,151
Why, you gonna give the guy

762
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:41,019
who pulled the trigger
a commendation?

763
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:42,721
(laughter)

764
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,023
Well, it's a homicide, right?

765
00:34:45,091 --> 00:34:48,293
But if you think this thing'll
give you a leg up, um...

766
00:34:48,361 --> 00:34:50,963
you can make a photocopy;
I'll get it back from you later.

767
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,031
(ringing resumes)

768
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:56,101
Oh, man...
Hold on a second, will you?

769
00:34:58,438 --> 00:35:01,006
Hey, Allison, I'm with someone.
Can this wait?

770
00:35:01,074 --> 00:35:04,510
No, it can't Lee. I need to talk
to you about a detective.

771
00:35:04,577 --> 00:35:05,844
A man named Carver.

772
00:35:05,912 --> 00:35:07,679
Do you know him?

773
00:35:07,747 --> 00:35:10,282
Of course. He's standing right
here, as a matter of fact.

774
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,652
Yeah, he stopped by, uh,
after his shift. Why?

775
00:35:15,688 --> 00:35:18,323
Oh, my God, Lee.
Say that again out loud.

776
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:20,559
Say that loud enough so
that he can hear you.

777
00:35:20,627 --> 00:35:22,161
Say that he's standing there
with you.

778
00:35:22,228 --> 00:35:23,795
Please.

779
00:35:23,863 --> 00:35:27,099
I'm standing right here with
Detective Aaron Carver.

780
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:29,368
Why? What's going on?

781
00:35:29,435 --> 00:35:32,738
I can't explain it right now.
He's involved in all this.

782
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:36,608
I think he may be the man who's
meant to kill you.

783
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,277
Gee, that's not the
kind of thing

784
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,479
you tell a guy
over the phone.

785
00:35:40,547 --> 00:35:43,949
Uh, hold on a second.

786
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:48,887
Uh... so it turns out that I'm
gonna have to take this.

787
00:35:48,955 --> 00:35:50,822
Uh, but the good news is, uh...

788
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,824
I will be going in
to work today.

789
00:35:52,892 --> 00:35:54,226
So listen, you have my word,

790
00:35:54,294 --> 00:35:56,528
I'll find that notebook and I'll
make a copy for you

791
00:35:56,596 --> 00:35:59,064
as soon as I get into the
precinct. Sound good?

792
00:35:59,132 --> 00:36:01,934
CARVER:
Yeah.

793
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:02,935
(door shuts)

794
00:36:03,002 --> 00:36:03,936
Is he gone?

795
00:36:04,003 --> 00:36:05,270
Yeah, he's gone.

796
00:36:05,338 --> 00:36:06,505
Good.

797
00:36:06,573 --> 00:36:08,574
(indistinct conversations)

798
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:11,910
(conversation stops)

799
00:36:11,978 --> 00:36:13,412
What's going on?

800
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:15,280
I don't know.
What is going on?

801
00:36:15,348 --> 00:36:17,282
I don't know.
What are you talking about?

802
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:20,586
Daniel Burroughs is sitting
in our office.

803
00:36:20,653 --> 00:36:24,723
He says he wants
to talk to you.

804
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:27,259
Oh, geez.

805
00:36:28,928 --> 00:36:30,429
Hello.

806
00:36:30,496 --> 00:36:33,398
I like an engineer who
keeps a clean desk.

807
00:36:33,466 --> 00:36:34,933
Thank you.

808
00:36:35,001 --> 00:36:38,737
An engineer with a messy desk,

809
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:41,073
it seems like a fundamental
contradiction,

810
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,444
like a priest who doesn't pray,
dentists who don't brush.

811
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:51,350
Now... let's talk about
engineers who meditate.

812
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,885
Uh, Mr. Burroughs, I
just want you to know

813
00:36:53,953 --> 00:36:56,088
that I would never do
that on company time.

814
00:36:56,155 --> 00:36:59,157
Everyone who does it,
raise their hand.

815
00:36:59,225 --> 00:37:00,425
(mutters)

816
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,867
I didn't pay much attention to
my health when I was your age.

817
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,803
Didn't pay much attention to my
health until a few years ago.

818
00:37:11,871 --> 00:37:13,272
Heart attack.

819
00:37:13,339 --> 00:37:16,275
Doctor told me that
I was stressed,

820
00:37:16,342 --> 00:37:18,677
wanted me to retire.

821
00:37:18,745 --> 00:37:20,145
I probably used that same

822
00:37:20,213 --> 00:37:22,214
"priests who don't pray,
dentists who don't brush"

823
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:24,449
on him, too, and when he saw
that wasn't getting

824
00:37:24,517 --> 00:37:27,953
any traction...
he mentioned meditation.

825
00:37:28,021 --> 00:37:31,290
So, you meditate?

826
00:37:31,357 --> 00:37:33,158
An hour a day.

827
00:37:33,226 --> 00:37:37,095
That's why I commissioned
that garden you were
sitting in yesterday.

828
00:37:37,163 --> 00:37:39,798
I almost quit before
I ever started.

829
00:37:39,866 --> 00:37:42,567
My wife talked me into sticking
with it, and now...

830
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,737
I honestly think that it may
have saved my life.

831
00:37:47,073 --> 00:37:48,640
I looked at your file.

832
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:51,376
You've done some pretty
impressive work in solar.

833
00:37:51,444 --> 00:37:54,146
It's a shame that it didn't work
out in the long term.

834
00:37:54,213 --> 00:37:55,714
Thank you.

835
00:37:55,782 --> 00:37:58,383
I'm proud of what
we were able to do.

836
00:37:58,451 --> 00:38:00,385
My wife and I are having

837
00:38:00,453 --> 00:38:02,020
a little dinner party
this weekend,

838
00:38:02,088 --> 00:38:04,556
and I would love it if you
and your wife would come.

839
00:38:04,624 --> 00:38:07,092
I'd love to pick your brain
about that solar cell project.

840
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,762
Maybe we can talk a
bit about what you hope
to accomplish here.

841
00:38:12,865 --> 00:38:15,400
<i>ALLISON:
Are you saying
this all happened 'cause</i>

842
00:38:15,468 --> 00:38:17,369
the guy saw you meditating
during your lunch hour?

843
00:38:17,437 --> 00:38:18,937
JOE:
Yeah, I guess so.
Weird, right?

844
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,707
I mean, anyway, I just thought
I'd give you a heads up in case

845
00:38:21,774 --> 00:38:23,608
you need to drop anything off
at the dry cleaner's.

846
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,078
Duly noted. I'll see you when
you get home. (blows a kiss)

847
00:38:26,145 --> 00:38:27,846
(hangs up)

848
00:38:27,914 --> 00:38:32,517
You know, my son's
not much interested
in office politics.

849
00:38:32,585 --> 00:38:34,186
(scoffs) Thinks it's
all about merit.

850
00:38:34,253 --> 00:38:35,787
That's always
been his weakness.

851
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,690
You knew that he was gonna meet
the founder of the company

852
00:38:38,758 --> 00:38:40,492
if he started meditating,
didn't you?

853
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,795
And his heart?

854
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,497
Boy's heart's just fine.

855
00:38:45,565 --> 00:38:48,834
So, you scared him-- us--
for no reason?

856
00:38:48,901 --> 00:38:53,004
No reason?! I was giving the kid
a leg up on his career.

857
00:38:53,072 --> 00:38:54,840
I mean, the kid
just doesn't get it.

858
00:38:54,907 --> 00:38:56,475
If you want to be the boss,

859
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,144
you've got to do the same thing
the bosses do.

860
00:38:59,178 --> 00:39:01,747
Why do you think I took up golf?

861
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:03,749
My wife always said
I was a big phony:

862
00:39:03,816 --> 00:39:06,084
"Why do you play a sport you
don't even like?"

863
00:39:06,152 --> 00:39:10,422
But she didn't complain when the
promotions started rolling in.

864
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,890
Neither will you, Ally.

865
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:12,891
Well...

866
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:14,926
(phone rings)

867
00:39:14,994 --> 00:39:16,428
Hello?

868
00:39:16,496 --> 00:39:18,930
SCANLON:
Hey, we just spent the better
part of the day

869
00:39:18,998 --> 00:39:20,332
leaning on Detective Carver.

870
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,634
Turns out a cell phone number
registered to him

871
00:39:22,702 --> 00:39:24,503
was found in Randy Littleton's
notebook.

872
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,372
Now, Carver claims that's no
surprise, 'cause he tries to get

873
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,608
his number out to every gang
member in the city.

874
00:39:29,675 --> 00:39:31,576
Apparently, that's how he
recruits informants.

875
00:39:31,644 --> 00:39:34,780
I don't care what he says.
I saw him sit there and watch

876
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:37,549
while the Littleton brothers
murdered Juan Espinal.

877
00:39:37,617 --> 00:39:39,751
I believe you, Allison,
but right now, there's

878
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:42,621
no physical evidence that
connects him to any of this.

879
00:39:42,688 --> 00:39:43,855
That makes no sense.

880
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,091
If there wasn't enough evidence
in that notebook

881
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:49,161
to get him arrested, then why
did he want to kill you for it?

882
00:39:49,228 --> 00:39:50,529
First of all, we don't know

883
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,365
that's what he was doing
at my place.

884
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:56,668
And second of all, uh...
maybe Carver had no idea

885
00:39:56,736 --> 00:39:58,770
what the Littletons had written
down in there.

886
00:39:58,838 --> 00:40:00,605
Maybe he just couldn't risk
the possibility

887
00:40:00,673 --> 00:40:02,741
that there was something that
implicated him.

888
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:05,744
The upside is, Internal Affairs
is gonna keep an eye on him.

889
00:40:05,812 --> 00:40:06,778
That's it?

890
00:40:06,846 --> 00:40:08,880
For the moment, yeah.
Look, uh...

891
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,283
I know you're upset.
Hell, so am I.

892
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:14,286
But, uh...

893
00:40:14,353 --> 00:40:17,489
I also wanted to say thanks.

894
00:40:17,557 --> 00:40:20,225
If it was Carver who was gonna
kill me today,

895
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:22,127
you pretty much saved my life.

896
00:40:22,195 --> 00:40:23,495
You're welcome.

897
00:40:23,563 --> 00:40:26,198
Hey, hey, do me a favor.
Tomorrow when you wake up

898
00:40:26,265 --> 00:40:28,500
and everything's fine, just send
me a text, okay?

899
00:40:28,568 --> 00:40:31,002
(chuckles)
Done.

900
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:34,906
(elevator bell dings)

901
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:39,845
(cell phone rings)

902
00:40:44,016 --> 00:40:44,950
(soft chuckle)

903
00:40:45,017 --> 00:40:46,818
MAN:
Can you hold that?

904
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,222
Thanks.

905
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:01,333
(bell dings)

906
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,338
Detective Carver?

907
00:41:08,307 --> 00:41:09,708
I'm sorry, have we met?

908
00:41:09,775 --> 00:41:11,476
No, but I know
who you are.

909
00:41:11,544 --> 00:41:13,712
And I know you're
in grave danger.

910
00:41:13,779 --> 00:41:15,614
Danger? I don't think so.

911
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,782
You should think again.

912
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,951
The Littletons
are gone now.

913
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,687
Once word spreads that you
partnered up with them--

914
00:41:22,755 --> 00:41:26,291
the same stickup boys
who terrorized every
drug dealer in Phoenix--

915
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:27,926
I think some pretty
dangerous people

916
00:41:27,994 --> 00:41:30,428
are gonna come
looking for you.

917
00:41:32,164 --> 00:41:34,633
You know what I would
do if I was you?

918
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,003
I'd turn myself in, let
the police protect me.

919
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,739
It's just a suggestion.

920
00:41:40,806 --> 00:41:44,609
Lady, I don't have any idea what
you're talking about.

921
00:41:44,677 --> 00:41:46,778
But do yourself a favor.

922
00:41:46,846 --> 00:41:49,514
Don't lose any sleep worrying
about me.

923
00:41:49,582 --> 00:41:50,549
(chuckles)

924
00:41:50,616 --> 00:41:53,118
Don't worry.
I won't.

925
00:42:04,497 --> 00:42:13,433
