00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,670
Previously on Medium:

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:07,990
Ashley's dad invited me,Madison,and Carla to go
skiing at his cabin in Flagstaff next weekend.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,120
So it would just be,uh,you
three girls and Ashley's dad?

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,120
Well,Ashley's older
brother Jamie will be there,

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,020
and I,uh,think he's
bringing a few friends,too.

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,770
- How much older is Ashley's...
- He's a senior.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,220
You have to let me go on that ski trip.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,130
Why don't we talk about this
tonight when your sisterare asleep.

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,890
And tonight what? Your mind's made up.
Dad's mind's made up. So just forget it.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,210
- Okay,fine.
- Fine!

11
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,040
Honey,could you go tell your sister
in the kitchen that her room's ready?

12
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,360
What are you talking about?

13
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,620
She's not even home from school yet.

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,510
You know,it's Friday.

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,280
I bet she left school
and went on that ski trip.

16
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,170
Ariel?

17
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,750
Time is priceless,yet
it costs us nothing.

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,480
You can do anything you want with it...

19
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,650
but own it.

20
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,410
You can spend it,but you can't keep it.

21
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,840
And once you've lost
it,there's no getting it back.

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,300
It's just... gone.

23
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,560
Did you think I wasn't gonna
come up there and get you?

24
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,460
Did you honestly think that
once we realized you were gone,

25
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,900
that-that we were just
gonna let you stay up there?

26
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,720
That was the most humiliating
experience of my entire life.

27
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,450
- Well,I'm sorry.
- The way you rang the doorbell?

28
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,580
You woke everybody up and
dragged me out of there

29
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,580
- in front of all my friends!
- I didn't drag you.

30
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,590
- I hate you!
- Well,I can't do anything about that.

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,480
We told you you couldn't
go,and you went anyway.

32
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,390
For no reason at all!

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,640
It was just a ski trip!

34
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,970
Yes,with boys! With
18-year-old boys!

35
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,190
So you don't trust me!

36
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,200
No,I don't trust them,Ariel.

37
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,250
You don't have to trust
them! You have to trust me!

38
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,940
I am older than you; I've
lived longer than you;

39
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,510
and I'd like to think that I've
acquired a little bit of wisdom

40
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,580
along the way that you
might not have acquired yet!

41
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,160
Couple years from now,you'll be old
enough,you go out,you-you go to college,

42
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,740
you'll be out of the house,you'll
make your own decisions! Until then...

43
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,620
Dad!

44
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,500
It's your sister's birthday tomorrow,so
when you get up in the morning,

45
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,970
I don't want any attitude,okay?

46
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,800
Well,how did it go?

47
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,300
How do you think it went?

48
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,950
Did you hit any rain?

49
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,090
What are you talking about? We
haven't had rain here for a month.

50
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,080
What did she say?

51
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,840
She didn't say anything,not a word.

52
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,520
I couldn't get her to talk
to me the whole way home.

53
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,800
How did we get here,Al?

54
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,720
I mean,how the hell did we get here?

58
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,730
No standing on tippy-toes.
That's cheating.

59
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,760
Oh,my goodness,I think
we're looking at...

60
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,030
at-at record-shattering
heights here.

61
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,060
Don't you feel dizzy being up that high?

62
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,090
Ah,you,my dear,are
officially five years tall!

63
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,170
Happy birthday,baby!

64
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,240
Can we have cake now?

65
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,050
Ooh,cake for breakfast? No,no,no.

66
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,710
We must save that for later.

67
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,870
Don't you remember?

68
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,080
You and your friend Lauren
are gonna have a play date.

69
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,130
Then when Mama gets home,she and Daddy are
gonna take you and your friends to the movies!

70
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,600
Where are you going?

71
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,490
I have to go to my boss's,do
a little bit of work.

72
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,460
But it's Saturday.

73
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,870
Just be for a couple of hours.

74
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,570
You know what,by the time you get
here,I'll probably already be home.

75
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,140
Happy birthday,sweetie!

76
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,290
Hey,Ariel,um,can you help your sister
with breakfast while I talk to your dad?

77
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,350
Sure.

78
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,730
Hey,I'm going straight
to Mommy Hell,aren't I?

79
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,130
It's only for a couple of hours,and
it's not like you could have said no.

80
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,330
You'll be here for all
the important stuff.

81
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,980
Okay,if I'm not back by 10:30,call
Devalos,tell him the house is on fire.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,930
Okay.

83
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,280
You know,you're a lot shorter
than I was when I was five?

84
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,100
Bridgette! Stop it.

85
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,390
What's the big deal? You were a lot
shorter than I was when I was five.

86
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,920
Only a little bit.

87
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,760
Marie is alot shorter than me.

88
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,740
I think it's because they
broke you before you were born.

89
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,020
Who broke me?

90
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,510
Bridgette,why are you telling her
things like that? It's her birthday.

91
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,470
What? It's true. You know it's true.

92
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,860
That's why she's short.

93
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,560
That's why she has to wear glasses.

94
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,890
Somebody broke me? Who broke me?

95
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,770
What's going on in here?

96
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,800
Who broke me,Daddy?

97
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,020
What are you talking about?

98
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,280
What is she talking about?

99
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,810
Bridgette's telling her
about the car accident,

100
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,040
the one that happened
just before she was born.

101
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,110
She said you broke me.

102
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,050
Whoa,whoa,whoa,nobody broke you.

103
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,380
No,no,no,Mommy was in a car
accident,and technically,you were,too,

104
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,570
because you were just a
little baby in Mommy's belly.

105
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,230
But nothing happened to you.
Nothing happened to anyone.

106
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:16,200
It was a long time ago,when
Mommy was pregnant with you.

107
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,050
Reallypregnant. She was,like,this big.

108
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,440
She was driving through an
intersection,and then a...

109
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,230
a car ran a red
light,and,um,actually,it wasn't a... car.

110
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,740
It was a plumber's van,a
Klog King plumber's van.

111
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,160
And it broke me?

112
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,790
No,sweetie,you were fine.

113
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,500
At first we worried about
you,but you turned out fine.

114
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,990
You weren't broken. You
were a perfect little baby.

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,270
And now you're a perfect
little... five-year-old girl.

116
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,510
Hello? Mr. Devalos?

117
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,960
Mr. Devalos,it's Allison.

118
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:24,680
Good. Uh,sir,I brought those files
that you wanted to go over with me.

119
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,330
Wha...

120
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,120
Who are you?

121
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,300
Please,she has nothing to do
with this. You came here for me.

122
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,600
Just... let her go.

123
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,000
I asked you a question.

124
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,030
- We work together.
- Please,just...

125
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:45,120
put the gun down. Let's...
let's talk about this.

126
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,090
There is nothing to talk about.

127
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,690
You took five years away from me.

128
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,930
Five years.

129
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,250
You ruined my life.

130
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,450
Now... I'm gonna ruin yours.

131
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,550
Please...

132
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,620
No,no,no! Please!
Please,please,please,please don't! Please!

133
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,100
It's my daughter's birthday.

134
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:30,900
Are you... are you okay? Can-can
you hear me? Are you okay?

135
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,570
I'm so sorry.

136
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,130
I
- I thought I could make the yellow light,and when you pulled through,I...

137
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,510
I was going too fast,and...

138
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,680
Oh,my God. You're pregnant.

139
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,820
- What are you talking about?
- I hit a pregnant lady.

140
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,110
What day is it?

141
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,040
Uh,M-Monday. Why?

142
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,770
What-what year is it?

143
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,580
Are you serious? You
don't know what year it is?

144
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,270
Uh,may-maybe you should sit down.

145
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,270
Uh,you want me to walk you to the curb?

146
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,210
Have we met before?

147
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,980
Have we done this before?

148
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,000
What do you... what do
you mean,had an accident?

149
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,700
Who's the president?

150
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,960
Of the United States?
Lady,you're scaring me.

151
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,260
Okay,forget that.
What-what year is this?

152
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,850
Uh,you-you know the
year,right? It's 2004.

153
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:35,160
Bush is the president.
You had a bad accident.

154
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,480
Let me walk you to the curb.

155
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,160
I'll call you an ambulance,all right?

156
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,930
You are a very lucky woman,Mrs. Dubois.

157
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,230
The car accident seems to have
caused no damage at all to the baby.

158
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,520
Butjust to be safe,I'm gonna speak
to your OB-GYN this afternoon,

159
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,760
ask him or her to keep
a close eye on things.

160
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,820
Oh,don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.

161
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,040
She's gonna be a beautiful,healthy baby.

162
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,510
Oh,I didn't realize.
You already know the sex?

163
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,070
Are you okay?

164
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,170
Oh,my God. I got here
as fast as I could.

165
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,030
She's fine,Mr. Dubois.

166
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,620
And the baby appears
to be just fine as well.

167
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,450
Thank God. Look at you. You're so calm.

168
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,470
Talked to the guy from the body shop.

169
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,430
Apparently,you know,a new
windshield,which is pretty obvious,

170
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,470
they,they're gonna have to replace
the door and the front quarter panel.

171
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,340
They said they got to check the frame
before they can give us a final estimate.

172
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,140
What are you grinning about?

173
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,400
You've just come back from the hospital
from a horrific accident,Allison.

174
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,030
You could have been killed.
The baby could have been killed.

175
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,930
No,no. Sorry.

176
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,780
What?

177
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:00,350
Just all of this. This car,I never
thought I'd see this car again.

178
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,230
And you like this.

179
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,460
Like what?

180
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,710
Younger.

181
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,450
Younger than what?

182
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,790
Allison,you're not making any sense.

183
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,710
All right,I know,I know.

184
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,630
You're not gonna
understand,but this,uh...

185
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:22,650
this whole thing,this being hit by
the van,spending time in the hospital,

186
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,750
you talking about the
auto body shop right now.

187
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,950
All of it,it's like
I've been here before.

188
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,940
Like,like I'm in the
middle of this big d√©j vu.

189
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,980
What? Honey,why do you
suddenly look so sad?

190
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,940
Hey,everything's gonna
be fine. Come on. Smile.

191
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,770
I'm sorry,but I'm not good
at this,you know? I just...

192
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,730
when you start talking about all
this-this stuff,I'm not good at it.

193
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,960
I can't smile. I... You could
have... you could have died today.

194
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:00,180
I mean,when they,when they called me on
the phone,I almost had a heart attack.

195
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,670
On top of that,I'm missing work. I
mean,I don't see the humor in this.

196
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,780
- Where's the humor in this?
- There's no humor in this.

197
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,250
You mean this? Me saying
this to you right now?

198
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,220
This conversation,this is d√©j vu,too?

199
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,280
This is some sort of experience
that you've had before?

200
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,640
No,I've never had this
conversation before.

201
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,300
Good,because I'm living my life,you
know,right now,this moment,for the first time.

202
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,660
And I'm,honestly,I'm worried about you.

203
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,210
I'm worried about our baby,and
I'm worried about our other babies.

204
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,090
And I-I'm seriously wondering
if I should turn this car around

205
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,940
and drive you back to the hospital to
have them look at you a little bit more.

206
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,920
No,no,no. Honey,I told you,that is
not necessary. Everything is fine.

207
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,500
There's no more d√©j vu.

208
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,580
The d√©j vu is gone,okay?

209
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,520
Thank you.

210
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,370
Okay. Now... all right.

211
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:56,270
Listen,um,I called the university from the
hospital,and I left messages for all your professors.

212
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,710
I told them that definitely you're not coming in
till the end of the week and maybe even longer.

213
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,610
Okay? Now,promise me you're gonna
go in the house and lie down.

214
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,280
I'm gonna go pick up Ariel from school
and Bridgette from day care,okay?

215
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,360
If anything happens,anything,contractions,anything,I
got my pager,I got my cell phone.

216
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,590
Honey,nothing's gonna happen for weeks.

217
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,660
You don't know that.
You don't know that.

218
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,920
Well,it may be circumstantial,but
it's also very compelling.

219
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,100
There's no doubt in my mind that this
jury will find Nathan Hunsecker guilty

220
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,520
of murdering his wife,none whatsoever.

221
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:37,300
As I'm sure most of our viewers are aware,Jessamyn
Hunsecker disappeared almost six weeks ago.

222
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,370
Shortly after going missing,police
arrested her husband,

223
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,690
Nathan Hunsecker,and
charged him with murder.

224
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,030
My God,that's him.

225
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,600
Mom!

226
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,410
Are you okay?

227
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,090
Dad told us what happened.

228
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,270
Yeah,I'm fine.

229
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,790
You feel okay?

230
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,840
I need to talk to you for a second.

231
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,740
Okay. So,uh,in the future,you work
for the district attorney's office.

232
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:12,000
And,uh,this guy,uh,Hunsecker,who
he's trying to put away right now,

233
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,500
he's gonna end up shooting
and killing you both,

234
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:19,000
murdering you both,uh,in the
district attorney's house.

235
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,170
In the future,five years from now,yes.

236
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,120
In the future.

237
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,180
I feel like I need to warn him.

238
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,520
I'm sorry. Warn who?

239
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,680
The district attorney.

240
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,670
Look,I see you're having
a tough time with this.

241
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:37,540
I see that I'm upsetting you. I'm sorry.

242
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,900
But maybe that's why
this is all happening.

243
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,090
Maybe this is why I woke up in 2004.

244
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,420
You know,in the future,I talk to you
about this kind of stuff all the time.

245
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,740
What do you want me to say?

246
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,890
I want you to tell me what to do.

247
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,710
Darling,I don't think
there's anything to do.

248
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,400
You don't know the district attorney.

249
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,640
And more importantly,he
doesn't know you.

250
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,670
Mrs. Hunsecker,you came.

251
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,580
- Against my better judgment.
- Come on. Don't say that.

252
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,550
I don't know why you need to
keep going around about this.

253
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,140
It's not like there were any surprises.

254
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,670
I couldn't have been clearer.

255
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,860
This thing we had-- it
was all about having fun.

256
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,220
And we had fun.

257
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,570
And we can have more fun.

258
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,050
I don't think so.

259
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,970
Why? Because I like you? Because I care?

260
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,580
I'm married.

261
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,930
I'm not looking to be liked.

262
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,150
I'm not looking to be cared
about. That I get at home.

263
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,750
You know you love me.

264
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:04,510
No. I like you. I've always liked you.

265
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,440
But I love my husband.

266
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,540
Just like you,love my husband.

267
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,870
So I need you to look at me and
tell me you understand it's over.

268
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,370
- Please.
- Jess.

269
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,360
No more calls. No more
e-mails,or I'll tell him.

270
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,400
I'll tell Nate everything,and
that would be bad for me.

271
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,180
But we both know that
would be bad for you,too.

272
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,080
Okay.

273
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,350
I understand.

274
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,430
But,um,you don't have
to go right now,do you?

275
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:45,730
- As a matter of fact,I need to...
- Because I-I made us a picnic.

276
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,280
It's the middle of the night.

277
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,270
Yeah,it's a... candlelight picnic.

278
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,380
- Candles,tablecloth on the ground,wine...
- I'm sorry.

279
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,780
Please,will you just
please come,just look at it?

280
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,270
Spent the past 45 minutes
setting it up I mean,look at me.

281
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,210
You don't have to eat
anything or drink anything.

282
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,720
Just please,at least
come look at it. Okay?

283
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,660
Don't make me fold it up and put it away and
bring it home,knowing you didn't even see it.

284
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,060
Okay. Fine. I'll take a look.

285
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,250
But then I've got to go.

286
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,900
- Okay.
- Okay.

287
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,210
What do you think?

288
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,720
I don't get it. Where's the picnic?

289
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,720
I don't see any candles.

290
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,860
What is this?

291
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:45,070
This? Well,this is what you wanted.

292
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,640
This is me showing you I understand.

293
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,680
No. Please,please
don't shoot me. Please!

294
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,920
Oh,my God.

295
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,010
My name is Allison Dubois,and I-I'm
trying to reach the district attorney.

296
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:10,260
I have some information about the Nathan
Hunsecker case,and I was given this number.

297
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,990
Uh,good morning,Mrs. Dubois.
This is Officer Scanlon.

298
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,340
So,uh,what kind of information
are we talking about here?

299
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,940
Wait,I'm sorry. Did you say Officer
Scanlon,not Detective Scanlon?

300
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,420
Uh,no,ma'am. Detectives,uh...
they don't work the tip line.

301
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,640
Officers do. Now,what
can I do for you today?

302
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,310
O
- Okay.

303
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,840
Well,um,Officer Scanlon,uh,I
have reason to believe

304
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,260
that the district attorney
is prosecuting the wrong man.

305
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,710
Actually,I know for a fact that
Nathan Hunsecker didn't kill his wife.

306
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,290
Another man did.

307
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,870
If you like,I can give you a detailed
description of what this man looked like.

308
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,550
I can even tell you where he
buried Jessamyn Hunsecker's body.

309
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,440
So wait a second. Are you
telling me that you're a witness?

310
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,720
You telling me you actually
saw this murder being committed?

311
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,220
Well,no,no. Not exactly.

312
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,710
Well,I don't understand.How is it you
know what the real killer looks like

313
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,050
if you didn't actually
see him commit the murder?

314
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,500
And how would you know where the body was
buried if you didn't see someone bury it?

315
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,640
I'm sorry. Could you please,uh,spell
your name again for me,ma'am?

316
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,930
Hello? Ma'am,are you there?

317
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,600
You do understand it's a crime to knowingly
provide false information to the police.

318
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,880
Don't you think you ought
to have some breakfast?

319
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,940
It's Tuesday. It's
waffle day. Your favorite.

320
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,610
Today's Tuesday?

321
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,700
All day.

322
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,390
Hey,um,how would you feel
about me borrowing your car?

323
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,610
I could just give the girls a
ride to-to day care and school.

324
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,630
And I could give you a ride to work.

325
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,290
What,are you,are you feeling
well enough to go to class?

326
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,740
Well,I just,uh,have a little
errand I'd like to run.

327
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,660
Thanks,Lucy.

328
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,480
Excuse me,Mr. District Attorney.

329
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,190
I'm sorry to disturb your lunch.

330
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,290
I tried to call your office,but
they wouldn't put me through.

331
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,860
I have information regarding
the Nathan Hunsecker case,

332
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,890
information I think might
help prove his innocence.

333
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,670
Really?

334
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,630
I'm-I'm sorry. Do... we
know each other? Have we met?

335
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,850
Um,sit down,please.

336
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,490
Uh,you look like you
should be sitting down.

337
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,290
Um,I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name.

338
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,440
It's Dubois. Allison Dubois.

339
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,360
Okay,Ms. Dubois.

340
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,190
Um,what is it you wanted to tell me?

341
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:37,610
I can give you a description of
the man who shot Jessamyn Hunsecker.

342
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,300
I can even show you where she's buried.

343
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,000
Well,that's quite a tip.

344
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,040
Uh,may I ask how you
came to know all this?

345
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,220
Well,it'd be simpler if you didn't.

346
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,410
The important thing is I can take
you straight to where her body is.

347
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,100
We can even go in the
same car,if you like.

348
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,060
And did you tell the police all this?

349
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,990
I tried.

350
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,920
What was the problem?

351
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,810
They asked me what you asked me.
They wanted to know how I knew.

352
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,450
And what did you say?

353
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,780
I hung up.

354
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,400
Are you afraid to tell me how you know?

355
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,290
If you're involved in this crime,I may be
able to offer you some form of arrangement,

356
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,040
some leniency in return
for your testimony.

357
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,480
I wasn't involved.

358
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,040
I saw it in a dream.

359
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,250
Excuse me?

360
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,120
I know how this sounds,but
I have them all the time.

361
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,960
These dreams,I mean.
Dreams that show me things.

362
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,740
And they're actually quite accurate.

363
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,910
So does that mean we're going?

364
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,590
Does that mean you want
me to show you the body?

365
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,810
No. This meansI'mgoing.

366
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,980
But,sir,he's gonna kill you.

367
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,250
What did you just say?

368
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,970
Nathan Hunsecker.

369
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,910
In five years,he's gonna come to
your house and he's gonna shoot you,

370
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,750
and I'm guessing it's 'cause you
convict him of a crime he didn't commit.

371
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,500
Okay,miss,look,my instinct
is to turn and leave,

372
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,410
but I can see you're very pregnant and
I'm concerned about your mental health.

373
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,250
Are you under someone's care?
Is there someone I can call?

374
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,520
No,there's no one to call.

375
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,060
I just... I need you to understand.

376
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,460
I see things.

377
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,300
Sometimes I even know things
that haven't happened yet.

378
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,790
And I understand that that sounds
crazy,but believe it or not,

379
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,700
in a few years you're
gonna come to depend on me.

380
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,940
We're gonna work together.
We're gonna be friends.

381
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,260
How do you think I knew
that you were gonna be here?

382
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,590
Because one day,years from
now,when we're friends,

383
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,250
you're gonna tell me that you come here
every Tuesday for a carnita sandwich,

384
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,960
that they are the best in the
city,that they remind you of sandwiches

385
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,820
that your Aunt Maria used to make
when you'd visit her in Rosarita.

386
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:56,620
Please,sir,just,just send someone
to the entrance of Clove Lake Park.

387
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,290
She's buried in a shallow grave
right inside the tree line.

388
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,430
She was shot once in the head.

389
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,280
Do you know where the
extra toothbrushes are?

390
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,720
Hey,do you hear me?

391
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,130
Oh,yeah,sorry.

392
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,330
I'm gonna have another baby.

393
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:27,860
Here I was thinking we were done with all
this,but now I'm about to do it all over again.

394
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,160
for the fourth time.

395
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,880
Talk about being the last to know.

396
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,880
Boy,do I feel dumb. Here I was,I thought
I was packing your bag for our third baby.

397
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,780
Yeah,I noticed that.
Why are you doing that?

398
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,640
Call me crazy,seeing that
your due date is tomorrow.

399
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,230
Do you have a preference?

400
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,160
Not really.

401
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,030
Hey,you know,you don't have
to rush to pack this bag.

402
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,150
Marie's late. She's not even
gonna be here for three weeks.

403
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,280
We're having another girl?

404
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,950
You know what? I forgot that we
weren't gonna find out this time.

405
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,280
Well,who could that be?
It's almost 10:00 at night.

406
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:15,890
You don't know? You
know everything else!

407
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,390
Can I help you?

408
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,020
Evening,sir. We're
looking for Allison Dubois.

409
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,470
Uh,what is this regarding?

410
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,810
Our district attorney would like to
speak to her about some information

411
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,300
that she passed on
regarding the Hunsecker case.

412
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,040
Are you Allison Dubois?

413
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,950
Information? What kind of information?

414
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,370
Do you have any idea
what he's talking about?

415
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,440
I know exactly what he's talking about.

416
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,130
Anyway,folks,we should get going.

417
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,040
It's important that the district
attorney speak with her this evening.

418
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,620
As you can see,my wife is very pregnant.

419
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,680
Honey,can you stay with the kids?

420
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,980
I'll just run and get dressed.

421
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,690
Appreciate your cooperation,ma'am.

422
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:58,870
Despite my better judgment,I sent a team of
investigators out to Clove Lake Park this afternoon.

423
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:04,470
Jessamyn Hunsecker's body was exactly where
you said it would be,shot once in the head.

424
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:09,050
Well,you're very welcome.

425
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,660
I didn't bring you here
to thank you,Mrs. Dubois.

426
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:17,130
You're here because I still need you
to tell me how you knew what you knew.

427
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:22,250
Notwithstanding our conversation earlier
in the day,I need a plausible explanation.

428
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,140
I already gave you the
only explanation I have.

429
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,390
Were you a witness?
Were you an accessory?

430
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,860
I promise you.

431
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:33,240
I had nothing to do with what
happened to Jessamyn Hunsecker.

432
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:37,200
I'm sorry,but your promise is of no
value to me and of no help to you.

433
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,990
I need an explanation,a
real-world explanation.

434
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,840
You should know that when the body
was exhumed the crime scene unit

435
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:52,110
believed they found some DNA
on Miss Hunsecker's clothing.

436
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,300
What kind of DNA?

437
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,380
I'd rather not say.

438
00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:00,230
Just that we suspect that it belongs to someone
who had something to do with Mrs. Hunsecker's death.

439
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,680
I'm sure that you won't mind providing a DNA
sample of your own to the police for comparison?

440
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,400
No,of course not.

441
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,800
That was easy.

442
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,320
Now if you'll just tell me how you
came to know where the body was buried.

443
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,690
I already told you.

444
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:23,620
So your only explanation is that
it all came to you in a dream?

445
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,880
It's notmyonly explanation.
It'stheonly explanation.

446
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,420
Well,then you leave me no choice.

447
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,190
Officer,would you please take
Mrs. Dubois to the booking desk?

448
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,460
Wha... what are you doing?

449
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,870
I'm having you placed under
arrest for obstruction of justice.

450
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,080
I haven't done anything wrong.

451
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,330
You have the right to an attorney.

452
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:46,330
If you can't afford one,one
will be provided for you.

453
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,890
Can I please just see my wife?
She's nine months pregnant.

454
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,920
Your wife's in booking now,Mr.
Dubois. She's being processed.

455
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,080
In the morning,she'll
go before the judge.

456
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,150
In the morning?

457
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,350
Did you not hear the part about
her being nine months pregnant?

458
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,300
Her due date is tomorrow.

459
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,350
Look,I know that she can say some...

460
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:08,430
you know,some pretty crazy things,but
there's no way that she killed someone.

461
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,340
Look,maybe she did. Maybe
she didn't. I don't know.

462
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:15,410
All I know is she knew exactly where
Jessamyn Hunsecker's body was buried.

463
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,720
And that can't be explained
by hormones. Excuse me.

464
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,450
Officer Scanlon.

465
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,160
I'm actually talking to
the husband right now.

466
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:32,020
You're kidding. No,I'll tell
him,yeah. All right,all right.

467
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,980
That was the District Attorney's office.

468
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,050
Looks like you'll be seeing your
wife a lot sooner than we thought.

469
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:03,440
Mrs. Dubois,I'm gonna give you one
last chance to tell me how you knew

470
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,430
where to find Jessamyn Hunsecker's body.

471
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,490
It's like I said.

472
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,420
It came to me in a
dream. I saw her face.

473
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,370
I saw the face of the
man who murdered her.

474
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:22,640
All right,then. You're free to
go. Your husband's waiting for you.

475
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,360
I don't understand. Are you saying
that I'm no longer under arrest?

476
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,770
That's exactly what I'm saying.

477
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,160
The case against Nathan
Hunsecker is closed.

478
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,560
Well,how can that be?

479
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,990
That is impossible.

480
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:38,020
He didn't do it. He
didn't kill his wife.

481
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,830
As it happens,Mr. Hunsecker
doesn't agree with you.

482
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,610
I just got off the
phone with his attorney.

483
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,190
In exchange for reducing the
charges to second-degree murder,

484
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,370
Mr. Hunsecker's changing his
plea from not guilty to guilty.

485
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,030
You can't take that deal.
You mustn't take that deal.

486
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,410
This man is innocent.

487
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:56,950
Mrs. Dubois,in my experience,innocent
men don't typically plead guilty.

488
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:00,390
Oh,my God,Mr. District
Attorney,you're making a big mistake.

489
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,870
Maybe I am,and maybe I'm not.

490
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:05,730
But let me offer you some advice.

491
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,990
I think you're a deeply disturbed woman.

492
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,920
I believe you need professional help,and for
the sake of your husband and your children,

493
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,500
I hope you get it.

494
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:18,350
Until then,know this: if you ever interfere
with another city investigation again,

495
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:22,340
I will see to it that you are prosecuted
to the fullest extent of the law.

496
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:38,460
I got Mrs. Richards from across
the street to watch the girls.

497
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:41,860
I lied and told her you thought you were having
contracMEtiMEon s,DD so I put you in a cab.

498
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,800
Just so when we get home,we'll just
tell her it was a false alarm,okay?

499
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:50,940
- Thanks for coming to get me.
- Yeah. Can I ask you something?

500
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:56,730
Um,that cop-- he said that you told the
police exactly where to find that woman's body.

501
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,270
How did you do that?

502
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,830
How did you know?

503
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,850
So it's a girl,huh?

504
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,260
Marie?

505
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:24,100
She's not coming for
another three weeks?

506
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,240
She's dead?

507
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,050
Jessamyn's dead?

508
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,940
I'm sorry,Nate.

509
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:38,720
They found her body
out at Clove Lake Park.

510
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,400
Listen,I know this is
difficult,but I need you to focus.

511
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,140
I need you to make some
tough decisions here.

512
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,540
We have a window of opportunity,but
it's going to close quickly.

513
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:01,750
I think it's time we talked to the
District Attorney about cutting a deal.

514
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,920
What? Why-why would I do
that? Why would I make a deal?

515
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:11,340
Nate...

516
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,390
Manuel Devalos is going to crucify you.

517
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,430
You've already handed him
the cross and the nails.

518
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:26,010
You don't even know where you were
the night Jessamyn disappeared.

519
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:30,590
Now,this guy-- he
means to win this case.

520
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,610
His credibility is riding on it.

521
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,170
He's a ruthless political animal.

522
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,620
Anybody who's ever gone up
against him will tell you that.

523
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,330
He will go to any lengths to win.

524
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,940
And frankly...

525
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:49,430
it wouldn't surprise me if he had his detectives
plant evidence on your wife's body to incriminate you.

526
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,810
And then you're staring
at the death penalty.

527
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:58,770
God,I can't make a deal. I
- I didn't kill her.

528
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,650
Nate...

529
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,590
We go back a ways.

530
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,890
I took this case as a favor to you.

531
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:11,560
I even waived my fee,but if
you're gonna ignore my advice,

532
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,170
then I have no choice
but to recuse myself.

533
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,670
Fine.

534
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,500
Call the District Attorney's office.

535
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:48,190
I'm sorry,Nathan,but this
really is the only way.

536
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,010
Thank you,counselor. I
appreciate your cooperation.

537
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,380
Mr. District Attorney?

538
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,500
Whatever you do,don't
make a deal with this man.

539
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,120
Mrs. Dubois,I had hoped that
I'd seen the last of you.

540
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,770
I told you before,and
I'll tell you again.

541
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,780
Nathan Hunsecker is innocent.

542
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,790
I'm sorry,Mrs. Dubois,but
you are deeply misinformed.

543
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:21,620
Nathan Hunsecker himself just stood with me
and his attorney here in front of the judge

544
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,730
and pleaded guilty to
second degree murder.

545
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,160
No,that can't be. He didn't
kill her. His attorney did.

546
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:31,280
I beg your pardon? Who are you and how
dare you level those accusations against me?

547
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,280
Please,counselor,ignore her.

548
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:36,380
She's a public nuisance,but I
promise you she poses no real threat.

549
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,130
- Officer!
- No,no,no,no!

550
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,650
He was having an affair
with his client's wife.

551
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,900
- Please escort her through the courthouse.
- She wanted to end it,and she threatened to tell her husband.

552
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,660
That's why he killed her! He
should be the one going to prison!

553
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,270
Don't do this! You're
making a big mistake!

554
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:57,360
- Let's sit her down over here.
- Oh,my... Oh,my goodness.

555
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,250
Nice and easy now,nice and easy.

556
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:02,510
It's okay. It's okay.
Go call an ambulance.

557
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,760
Shh,just do yourself a favor. Sit still.

558
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,630
Your water broke.

559
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:13,160
No... No,no,no. No,this isn't right.

560
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,630
No,please.

561
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,140
Marie isn't supposed to
come for another three weeks.

562
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,530
This isn't supposed to be happening.

563
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,680
Don't try to move,Mrs. Dubois.

564
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,420
You're in labor and you've lost
a significant amount of blood.

565
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,140
Unfortunately,your baby is in breach,

566
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,810
and we're going to have to perform
an emergency cesarean section.

567
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,970
We need to get your baby out now.

568
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:42,370
I'm right here,Allison.
I'm right next to you,okay?

569
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,670
Everything's going to be fine.

570
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,410
Fetal heartbeat's fading.

571
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:48,400
- What's going on?
- Let's get her prepped! Gloves and gown.

572
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,760
It's gonna be okay,Allison.
It's gonna be okay.

573
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:59,270
Joe,I'm sorry. I screwed
everything up. It's all my fault.

574
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,730
Stay with me Allison,okay?

575
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:07,090
You have to stay with
me. Stay with me...

576
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,100
You're still up?

577
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,590
I was sure you'd be asleep.

578
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:30,510
Yeah,I was,I mean,I guess I
was till like a minute ago.

579
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,460
Hey,who's the president?

580
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,820
What?

581
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,940
Just forget that question.

582
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,470
Is it Marie's birthday tomorrow?

583
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,530
Yeah,number five.

584
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,420
And don't think I didn't remind Ariel
of that out in the hallway just now.

585
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,430
Ariel,r-right.

586
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,560
You just picked her up
at her friend's ski house?

587
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,720
How'd that go?

588
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,170
How do you think it went?

589
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,820
She didn't say a thing. Not a word.

590
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,290
I couldn't get her to talk
to me the whole way home.

591
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,880
I mean,how did we get here,Al?

592
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,470
How the hell did we get here?

593
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,990
I know you're mad.

594
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,360
I know you're angry.

595
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,430
But Daddy and I didn't let you go on
that weekend with those 18-year-old boys

596
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,170
'cause you're not 18 yet.

597
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,860
But you know what?

598
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,520
Soon enough,you will be.

599
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,630
And then you're gonna be 19.

600
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,110
And then in a blink of
an eye,you're gonna be 40.

601
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,780
And the chances are that you're gonna
be sitting here with your 16-year-old,

602
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:52,490
trying to explain to her why
she had to wait to do something.

603
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,990
But...

604
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:02,630
all this time that you're choosing to
be angry at Daddy and I,you know,it's...

605
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:06,900
It's time that you could
have spent being happy.

606
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:10,240
Time... It's just gone.

607
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,790
And you never get it back.

608
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,890
I mean,there,there,there's
a second gone.

609
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,980
And you'll never have it again.

610
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,250
And there,there's another one.

611
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,530
It's just wasted.

612
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:25,510
We wasted it just holding on to anger.

613
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,410
Honey,am I making sense? I'm
not even sure I'm making sense.

614
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:39,360
But honey,just know this:
that tomorrow when you wake up,

615
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:41,080
you're gonna be a day older,

616
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:46,140
and you're gonna be a day closer to
being old enough to do whatever you want.

617
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:52,040
And you're gonna get that whether
you're angry at Daddy and me or not.

618
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,830
It's your choice.

619
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,820
Just know that I love you.

620
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,120
What are you doing?

621
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,730
Setting the alarm clock for 5:30.

622
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,270
What on earth for?

623
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,880
'Cause I don't want to
miss Marie's birthday.

624
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,400
What are you talking
about? Just get up at 7:00.

625
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,070
You'll be at your boss' by 8:00.

626
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,350
You'll be here in plenty of
time for Marie's birthday.

627
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,090
Just trust me on this.

628
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:45,930
If I'm not at Devalos' before the sun is
up,not only am I gonna miss Marie's birthday,

629
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:49,350
but I'm going to miss
yours,Ariel's,and Bridgette's.

630
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:02,670
Okay,okay,do you have
any idea what time it is?

631
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:04,740
Nathan Hunsecker.

632
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,220
Five years ago,you convicted
him of killing his wife.

633
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,360
- Do you rember?
- Yes,of course.

634
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:13,170
Good. Can I come in? I have
a story I need to tell you.

635
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:41,590
Mr. Hunsecker?

636
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,720
Congratulations on your early release.

637
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,380
What are you doing here?

638
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,480
I came here to see you.

639
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,620
I know that you're
extremely angry with me.

640
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,280
You've spent a lot of time in prison,

641
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:56,020
and I'm betting that you spent
some of that time thinking about me.

642
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:00,270
Thinking about what you might do to me once
you were released,and I can't blame you.

643
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,530
I know now that you shouldn't
have spent time in prison.

644
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,540
I know now that you
didn't kill your wife.

645
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,860
I can't give you back the past
five years of your life,sir.

646
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:15,110
But if you come with me,I believe
I can give you back your good name.

647
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,660
Your friend and attorney,Michael
Gilpin,was having an affair with your wife.

648
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,120
That's impossible.

649
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,640
He wouldn't have done that.

650
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,420
I've known Mike since college.

651
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,050
He was one of my groomsmen.

652
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:36,150
Mr. Hunsecker,he wasn't just
having an affair with your wife.

653
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:39,040
He murdered her as well.

654
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,490
I don't believe you.

655
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,710
This morning we found Jessamyn's
body buried in Clove Lake Park.

656
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,430
There was evidence on
the body,a few hairs.

657
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:55,830
Preliminary tests indicate they're
a perfect match for Michael Gilpin.

658
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,910
He already confessed to everything.

659
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,290
I'm sorry.

660
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,830
Four... Five!

661
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,370
Ready? One,two,three,take
your deep breath!

662
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,930
Make a wish!

663
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,630
Blow,blow!

664
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,780
Time is priceless,yet
it costs us nothing.

665
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:37,180
You can do anything you want
with it,but you can't own it.

666
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:42,170
You can spend it,but you can't keep it.

667
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:48,570
And once you've lost
it,there's no getting it back.

668
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,470
It's just... gone.
