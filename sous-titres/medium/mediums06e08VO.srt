1
00:00:01,437 --> 00:00:03,138
JOE:
You think she got in?

2
00:00:03,206 --> 00:00:05,173
ALLISON:
I don't know.

3
00:00:05,241 --> 00:00:07,309
I mean, it's kind of thick.

4
00:00:07,377 --> 00:00:08,543
Thick is good, right?

5
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:10,879
Thick is good.
Thick is good.

6
00:00:10,947 --> 00:00:12,848
You want to take a look?

7
00:00:12,915 --> 00:00:14,816
What are you talking about?
We can't take a look.

8
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:15,917
It's addressed to Ariel.

9
00:00:15,985 --> 00:00:16,952
Why not?

10
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,987
Come on, no one will know.

11
00:00:19,055 --> 00:00:21,023
You just steam open
the envelope right here

12
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,457
and then you reseal it.
No.

13
00:00:22,525 --> 00:00:24,092
Joe, come on.

14
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,427
Cornell's her dream school.

15
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:28,397
Ariel should be the one
to find out first if she got in.

16
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:32,300
(door opening)

17
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:34,269
(door closing)

18
00:00:34,337 --> 00:00:35,270
ARIEL:
Mom?

19
00:00:35,338 --> 00:00:36,938
Dad? Anybody home?

20
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:40,242
Home, yes, yes, we're
home. Here we are.

21
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:41,910
We're just waiting
in the kitchen.

22
00:00:41,978 --> 00:00:43,445
Just growing older
by the minute.

23
00:00:43,513 --> 00:00:45,781
Waiting for you...

24
00:00:45,848 --> 00:00:47,916
ALLISON:
Oh, I didn't know

25
00:00:47,984 --> 00:00:50,419
you were with somebody.

26
00:00:50,486 --> 00:00:54,089
Um, Mom, Dad, this is
my friend Kyle Covington.

27
00:00:54,157 --> 00:00:55,657
Ms. Dubois.

28
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:58,560
Hi. Nice to meet you, Kyle.

29
00:00:58,628 --> 00:00:59,561
Mr. Dubois.

30
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:00,695
It's nice to
meet you, Kyle.

31
00:01:00,763 --> 00:01:01,730
You're just in time.

32
00:01:01,798 --> 00:01:03,465
Ariel's just about
to open a letter

33
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:06,501
that she got from
the admissions office
at Cornell University.

34
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:11,006
Or you could just
leave it there

35
00:01:11,074 --> 00:01:13,075
and watch while your
father has a heart attack.

36
00:01:13,142 --> 00:01:14,776
Your call.

37
00:01:14,844 --> 00:01:18,246
Um... you know what,

38
00:01:18,314 --> 00:01:21,083
it kind of doesn't matter.

39
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,985
What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

40
00:01:24,053 --> 00:01:26,488
It's Cornell. It's
your dream school.

41
00:01:29,325 --> 00:01:31,493
Um...

42
00:01:33,262 --> 00:01:35,864
It doesn't matter
because I'm pregnant.

43
00:01:35,932 --> 00:01:38,600
(gasps)

44
00:01:38,668 --> 00:01:41,069
Bad dream.

45
00:01:41,137 --> 00:01:44,840
The worst ever.

46
00:01:44,907 --> 00:01:48,810
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

47
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,192
So this mystery kid Kyle--
did he seem nice?

48
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,760
Was he nice?

49
00:02:38,928 --> 00:02:40,428
Yeah, you're saying
that he's going to be

50
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:42,564
the father of my grandchild,
and that's like, you know,

51
00:02:42,632 --> 00:02:43,999
it's like Christmases and
Thanksgivings and birthdays.

52
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:46,968
And I just want to know
if I was going to like the guy.

53
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:49,704
I can't believe you're
joking about all this.

54
00:02:49,772 --> 00:02:53,008
She's giving up her future--
everything she's worked for.

55
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:55,977
And you're asking me if the kid
she's giving it up for is nice?

56
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:59,147
Do you really think that this
is one of those dreams?

57
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:00,949
I mean, even I've had
dreams like that.

58
00:03:01,017 --> 00:03:04,052
Every parent with a daughter
has dreams like that.

59
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,454
What are you looking for anyway?

60
00:03:06,522 --> 00:03:07,589
The camcorder.

61
00:03:07,657 --> 00:03:09,591
I thought I had it
in the case.

62
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:12,427
I want to tape Bridgette at
the clarinet recital she's got.

63
00:03:12,495 --> 00:03:14,129
I want to make sure
it's charged.

64
00:03:14,196 --> 00:03:15,430
I think
I saw the girls

65
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:17,966
playing with it
the other day.

66
00:03:18,034 --> 00:03:19,935
Have you taken
a look in there?

67
00:03:21,304 --> 00:03:22,671
Aw...

68
00:03:22,738 --> 00:03:25,774
Aha, here it is.

69
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:27,742
Why didn't I know that?

70
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,844
Okay, now one bar.

71
00:03:29,912 --> 00:03:31,546
See? I'm glad I looked.

72
00:03:31,614 --> 00:03:33,081
What's this?

73
00:03:33,149 --> 00:03:36,484
(groans)

74
00:03:36,552 --> 00:03:38,687
Really!

75
00:03:38,754 --> 00:03:40,722
(yelling)

76
00:03:42,858 --> 00:03:44,259
JOE:
Did you tape this?

77
00:03:44,327 --> 00:03:45,427
BRIDGETTE:
Yeah.

78
00:03:45,494 --> 00:03:47,295
Why, Bridge?

79
00:03:47,363 --> 00:03:48,663
I don't know.

80
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:50,298
He's funny.

81
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:52,033
No, that is not right.

82
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:53,635
Just because you think
this man's funny,

83
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:55,704
doesn't mean
you can tape him
without telling him.

84
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:57,572
He's our neighbor and you
violated his privacy.

85
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
No, not really.

86
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,041
He doesn't even
know about it.

87
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:01,876
No, just because he
doesn't know about it

88
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:03,144
doesn't mean it's
not a violation.

89
00:04:03,212 --> 00:04:05,113
What are we going
to do about this, huh?

90
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:07,882
You're not going to make me
apologize, are you?

91
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,185
Because then he would
know about it,

92
00:04:10,252 --> 00:04:12,120
and that would just
make things worse, right?

93
00:04:12,188 --> 00:04:14,456
The first thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to delete this,

94
00:04:14,523 --> 00:04:15,957
and the second thing
I'm going to do

95
00:04:16,025 --> 00:04:17,759
is I'm going to forbid you
from using this camera again.

96
00:04:17,827 --> 00:04:20,261
Go to your room and finish
getting ready for school.

97
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,997
You too, Tonto.

98
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:23,598
Girls, come on.

99
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,700
Five minutes and
we're out of here.

100
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:28,637
Um...

101
00:04:28,704 --> 00:04:33,041
So, um, I was wondering--

102
00:04:33,109 --> 00:04:35,610
would it be okay if I came home
after dinner tonight?

103
00:04:35,678 --> 00:04:38,079
What's going on?

104
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:39,814
Well, I have S.A.T. prep
this afternoon,

105
00:04:39,882 --> 00:04:42,417
and then I was going to go over
to my friend Casey's house.

106
00:04:42,485 --> 00:04:44,085
We have an A.P. chem test
this Wednesday

107
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:45,520
and we were going
to study together.

108
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:47,355
I guess so.

109
00:04:47,423 --> 00:04:50,358
But who's Casey?
Do we know her?

110
00:04:50,426 --> 00:04:52,661
No, you don't know her.

111
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:55,263
And don't get crazy, but...

112
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:58,667
Casey's not a her.

113
00:04:58,734 --> 00:04:59,901
A boy?

114
00:05:01,604 --> 00:05:04,939
Well, when were you going
to tell us this?

115
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:07,042
I don't know,
I'm telling you now.

116
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:12,847
So, uh, is this a boy
you study with, or...?

117
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:18,720
I mean, we like each other.

118
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:20,155
And then we hang out.

119
00:05:20,222 --> 00:05:23,358
We haven't gone on a date
yet or anything.

120
00:05:23,426 --> 00:05:25,994
So, is it okay?

121
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:28,430
Well, I guess I'm just
a little confused.

122
00:05:28,497 --> 00:05:29,497
(nervous chuckle)

123
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:38,206
Um, did, um, did Casey's mom
invite you to dinner?

124
00:05:38,274 --> 00:05:40,842
I mean, I don't know,
he mentioned it.

125
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,812
So I-I don't know if his mother
is, you know...

126
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:47,716
I'll tell you what, why don't
you guys go do the S.A.T. prep

127
00:05:47,783 --> 00:05:49,784
and then you and Casey
come back here.

128
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,823
You-you want me
to bring him here?

129
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,558
Yeah. Sure, why not?

130
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,493
We got food, we got dinner.

131
00:05:58,561 --> 00:06:01,262
You guys can study
in the living room.

132
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,764
Sounds good to me.

133
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:07,535
You think it over,
okay, honey?

134
00:06:07,603 --> 00:06:09,571
And talk about it with Casey.

135
00:06:09,638 --> 00:06:11,973
But either way, I want you
back here for dinner.

136
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:16,377
Great.

137
00:06:16,445 --> 00:06:19,948
SCANLON:
The guy's name is
Earl Sanderson. 55.

138
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:22,917
Window was jimmied.

139
00:06:22,985 --> 00:06:24,519
A couple things missing.

140
00:06:24,587 --> 00:06:26,788
It kind of looks like
a robbery gone wrong, right?

141
00:06:26,856 --> 00:06:29,257
I don't know.
Why are you looking at me?

142
00:06:29,325 --> 00:06:31,392
I'm not even sure
why you want me here.

143
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,394
The guy's facedown
in the fridge.

144
00:06:33,462 --> 00:06:34,796
Facedown.

145
00:06:34,864 --> 00:06:36,931
What's he doing, offering
the robber a beer?

146
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:39,734
Or did the petty thief break in,
realize that the guy was home

147
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:41,903
and shoot in the back
'cause he relished the idea

148
00:06:41,971 --> 00:06:43,605
of turning his
breaking and entering

149
00:06:43,672 --> 00:06:46,608
into a crime that
would get him either life
or the electric chair?

150
00:06:46,675 --> 00:06:50,478
I don't know-- my Spidey sense
is telling me that all is
not what it appears to be,

151
00:06:50,546 --> 00:06:53,414
and I was hoping that my
friend that sometimes sees
things that aren't there

152
00:06:53,482 --> 00:06:55,083
might help to shed some light.

153
00:06:55,151 --> 00:06:58,119
We got a partial
sneaker print

154
00:06:58,187 --> 00:06:59,487
off the dirt outside
the window,

155
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:01,256
but other than that,
I got nothing.

156
00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:03,158
(motor starting)

157
00:07:03,225 --> 00:07:04,759
<i>MAN:
No! No, please!</i>

158
00:07:04,827 --> 00:07:08,029
No, no, please!

159
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:10,932
Please, please,
please don't do this!

160
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,902
Please don't do this to me!

161
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:16,137
Someone help! Help!

162
00:07:16,205 --> 00:07:17,872
Help me!

163
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,441
Help me! Help me!

164
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:23,678
Someone, help!

165
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:25,480
Please, please don't do this!

166
00:07:25,548 --> 00:07:27,015
Please, please...

167
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:28,917
Why are you doing
this to me?!

168
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:32,120
Please, please
don't do this!

169
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:33,621
No, no, no!

170
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:35,156
No!

171
00:07:42,998 --> 00:07:45,967
You know what, I don't think
I'm going to be able to tell you

172
00:07:46,035 --> 00:07:48,469
who killed this man.

173
00:07:48,537 --> 00:07:51,806
But I might be able to tell you
about somebody this man killed.

174
00:07:51,874 --> 00:07:54,709
(wheezing laugh)

175
00:07:57,646 --> 00:08:00,915
(laughing continues)

176
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:09,290
I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry.

177
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:11,159
You got to come over
and see this thing

178
00:08:11,227 --> 00:08:12,560
my buddy forwarded me.

179
00:08:12,628 --> 00:08:14,362
This dude is freaking out.

180
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,463
Come here.

181
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:17,398
Come here.

182
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:21,469
Look at this.

183
00:08:23,706 --> 00:08:27,442
(yelling)
(laughing)

184
00:08:32,248 --> 00:08:33,848
Your friend found this
on the Internet?

185
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:34,983
Yeah.

186
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,018
This guy's hilarious.

187
00:08:38,454 --> 00:08:40,388
<i>ALLISON:
Okay, who is this man?</i>

188
00:08:40,456 --> 00:08:42,323
Do we know his name?

189
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:44,492
I don't know.
He's just some guy.

190
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,861
Some guy that lives around here.

191
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:48,363
Some guy?

192
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,431
Bridgette, he's a person.

193
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:51,966
He has feelings.

194
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:53,701
Now you've exposed him
to public ridicule.

195
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:55,837
JOE:
Last time I looked

196
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:58,539
thousands of people
had clicked on the video,

197
00:08:58,607 --> 00:09:01,042
and there are 60
or 70 comments, so...

198
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,411
After dinner, you and your dad
are taking those videos down.

199
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:04,946
And then you're banned
from the computer.

200
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:06,180
Until when?!

201
00:09:06,248 --> 00:09:07,916
Until I say you're not.

202
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:10,518
ARIEL:
Mom, Dad?

203
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:12,520
Be nice to your
sister's friend.

204
00:09:12,588 --> 00:09:14,289
In the kitchen.

205
00:09:15,925 --> 00:09:19,794
Um, Mom, Dad, this
is my friend Casey.

206
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:21,996
Casey, this is
my family.

207
00:09:22,064 --> 00:09:23,598
There's another sister
running around here somewhere.

208
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:28,569
I'm Kyle, Kyle Covington.
Everyone calls me Casey.

209
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:30,238
Mrs. Dubois.

210
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:35,276
I know that you dreamt that
this kid got Ariel pregnant,

211
00:09:35,344 --> 00:09:37,879
and wrecked her future
and everything, but...
But?

212
00:09:37,947 --> 00:09:40,548
But I don't know, but he
seemed kind of nice to me.

213
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,619
He did.

214
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:46,120
He was polite and respectful.

215
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:47,455
And he seemed kind of smart.

216
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:49,691
And he acted like he genuinely
cared for Ariel.

217
00:09:49,758 --> 00:09:51,993
I mean, we can't lock her up
until she's 25.

218
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:54,295
So forgive me if I take
some comfort in the fact

219
00:09:54,363 --> 00:09:55,797
that she's found someone
who's nice.

220
00:09:55,864 --> 00:09:58,099
No, you're right,
I take it back. Lucky us.

221
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:00,868
Our daughter's going to be
impregnated by a boy who's nice.

222
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:04,405
All's right with the world.

223
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:05,640
You don't know that.

224
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,075
Yeah, I do.

225
00:10:07,142 --> 00:10:09,310
No, you don't
know that.

226
00:10:09,378 --> 00:10:10,979
First of all,
you've told me yourself,

227
00:10:11,046 --> 00:10:12,380
your intuition
about these things

228
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:14,849
is notoriously unreliable
when it comes to loved ones.

229
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:17,318
And second of all,
if Ariel really--

230
00:10:17,386 --> 00:10:21,089
if she was like--
irresponsible in that way,

231
00:10:21,156 --> 00:10:23,257
do you think that
she'd allow herself

232
00:10:23,325 --> 00:10:24,792
to miss out on college?

233
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,361
Come on, not Ariel.

234
00:10:26,428 --> 00:10:27,795
Not the Ariel I know.

235
00:10:27,863 --> 00:10:29,764
Not if she was pregnant
with octuplets.

236
00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:31,733
So how about we forget
about the kid

237
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,168
that we don't know,
and consider the
kid that we do.

238
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:36,571
'Cause I got to tell you,
that this dream you had,

239
00:10:36,638 --> 00:10:38,206
it strikes me less
as a cautionary tale

240
00:10:38,273 --> 00:10:39,807
about premarital sex,
and more like

241
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,142
the anxious fears
of a mother

242
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,077
who's a little bit nervous
about the first boy

243
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:44,479
who's ever come
home for dinner.

244
00:10:44,546 --> 00:10:49,250
(phone ringing)

245
00:10:49,318 --> 00:10:50,551
Hello.

246
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:52,220
Sorry to call so late,

247
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,756
but you know that composite
you worked up this afternoon?

248
00:10:54,823 --> 00:10:57,325
I had someone compare it
to our missing persons database.

249
00:10:57,393 --> 00:10:58,993
I think
we may have found a match.

250
00:10:59,061 --> 00:11:01,496
Name's Angelo Filipelli.

251
00:11:01,563 --> 00:11:03,164
Small-time thief,
bunch of petty crimes.

252
00:11:03,232 --> 00:11:06,300
But, uh, I got to tell you,
if Earl Sanderson really did

253
00:11:06,368 --> 00:11:08,136
bury this guy in concrete,
I highly doubt

254
00:11:08,203 --> 00:11:09,971
that's the reason
he got shot last night.

255
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:12,073
W-Why do you say that?

256
00:11:12,141 --> 00:11:16,511
Because Angelo Filipelli
was reported missing in 1992,

257
00:11:16,578 --> 00:11:18,579
and no one's seen the guy since.

258
00:11:49,344 --> 00:11:51,345
(gasps)

259
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:56,960
You're sure it was Casey?

260
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:58,262
Yeah, I'm positive.

261
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:01,932
He was carrying a gun and he was
stalking that-that petty thief,

262
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,868
that dead man that I saw
yesterday-- Earl Sanderson.

263
00:12:04,936 --> 00:12:05,869
I don't know.

264
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:08,272
That kid that we
met yesterday,

265
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,908
he doesn't seem like the
kind to stalk anybody.

266
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:12,175
Much less use a gun.

267
00:12:12,543 --> 00:12:14,211
Well, I'm telling you,
it was him.

268
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:15,378
You didn't happen to notice

269
00:12:15,446 --> 00:12:17,080
what kind of shoes
he was wearing, did you?

270
00:12:17,148 --> 00:12:18,648
No. Why?

271
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:19,983
Well, because the police found

272
00:12:20,051 --> 00:12:22,352
a sneaker print outside
Sanderson's window.

273
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,787
Well, don't worry about it.

274
00:12:23,854 --> 00:12:26,590
I'll ask Casey myself
when we question him today.

275
00:12:26,657 --> 00:12:28,425
When you what?

276
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:31,528
When we
question him.

277
00:12:31,596 --> 00:12:33,396
A man was murdered, Joe,
shot in cold blood.

278
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:34,431
Yeah, I know that.

279
00:12:34,498 --> 00:12:35,699
But this kid
that we're talking about,

280
00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:37,901
this is, this is
our daughter's friend.

281
00:12:37,969 --> 00:12:39,569
And truthfully,
the only reason that you think

282
00:12:39,637 --> 00:12:41,838
that he might be involved
is 'cause you had a dream.

283
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:43,273
Isn't that reason enough?

284
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:44,441
Of course
it's reason enough.

285
00:12:44,508 --> 00:12:45,976
I'm just asking you to consider

286
00:12:46,043 --> 00:12:48,411
the possible repercussions of
what you're about to do here.

287
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:49,412
Like what?

288
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,547
You're going to
question this boy,

289
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:51,881
he's going to go to Ariel,

290
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:53,783
and she's going to be
really upset with you.

291
00:12:53,851 --> 00:12:55,118
So what would you have me do?

292
00:12:55,186 --> 00:12:56,386
I don't know, wait!

293
00:12:56,454 --> 00:12:57,520
Wait for what?

294
00:12:57,588 --> 00:12:58,588
More evidence.

295
00:12:58,656 --> 00:12:59,789
So at least you're sure.

296
00:12:59,857 --> 00:13:00,724
I am sure.

297
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:01,992
Well, I'm not.

298
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:03,994
Because this is our daughter's
first boyfriend.

299
00:13:04,061 --> 00:13:07,430
And don't you think that maybe,
just maybe, this is about that?

300
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:09,399
You don't have
to be Freud to suspect

301
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:11,434
that there's something else
going on here.

302
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:14,704
That maybe you're finding
reasons not to like this boy

303
00:13:14,772 --> 00:13:17,140
by inserting him into the case
you're working on.

304
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,608
You really think that?

305
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:19,909
I don't know what I think.

306
00:13:19,977 --> 00:13:20,910
Just tread lightly, okay?

307
00:13:20,978 --> 00:13:22,812
Tread lightly.

308
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,080
Well, I'm dropping off the girls

309
00:13:24,148 --> 00:13:25,815
and I'm meeting Lee
at the high school.

310
00:13:25,883 --> 00:13:27,083
To the high school?!

311
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:29,119
<i>CASEY:
I'm sorry.</i>

312
00:13:29,186 --> 00:13:31,221
I don't know what to tell you.

313
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:33,690
I've never seen this man before.

314
00:13:33,758 --> 00:13:34,891
Did something happen to him?

315
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,360
Someone, uh, shot him.

316
00:13:37,428 --> 00:13:38,828
He's dead.

317
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:40,363
You sure you're okay
talking to us?

318
00:13:40,431 --> 00:13:42,799
We'd be happy to wait for
your parents or a lawyer.

319
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:45,068
Yeah, there's no reason to wait.

320
00:13:45,136 --> 00:13:48,738
I don't know anything
about any of this.

321
00:13:48,806 --> 00:13:51,975
And, I mean, I know Mrs. Dubois.

322
00:13:52,043 --> 00:13:54,110
I just really want
to get back to class.

323
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:58,148
Just give us a second, will you?

324
00:14:00,151 --> 00:14:02,352
Uh, okay, I get that
you know this kid.

325
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,521
I get that, uh, you had
a dream, but, uh...

326
00:14:04,588 --> 00:14:06,222
But what?
Question him.

327
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,524
About what?

328
00:14:07,591 --> 00:14:09,693
He's a good, clean-cut
kid from the suburbs.

329
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,995
The dead man's a
small-time, lowlife punk.

330
00:14:12,063 --> 00:14:14,464
Absent your dream,
this makes no sense.

331
00:14:14,532 --> 00:14:17,667
Just... question him.

332
00:14:18,703 --> 00:14:20,704
(sighs)

333
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:26,943
All right.

334
00:14:30,781 --> 00:14:32,449
So, Casey...

335
00:14:34,452 --> 00:14:36,953
I need you to tell me where
you were two nights ago, say

336
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:39,923
between 10:00 at night,
2:00 in the morning.

337
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,393
At home.

338
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:47,564
Doing homework
and then sleeping.

339
00:14:47,631 --> 00:14:49,899
Look, am I in
some kind of trouble?

340
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:52,335
SCANLON:
Can anybody confirm that?

341
00:14:52,403 --> 00:14:54,637
That, uh, you were home, I mean.

342
00:14:54,705 --> 00:14:56,406
I don't know.

343
00:14:56,474 --> 00:14:58,742
My dad's out of town
on business, and my mom

344
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:01,444
went out to dinner
with friends that night.

345
00:15:01,512 --> 00:15:03,480
I went to sleep
before she got home.

346
00:15:03,547 --> 00:15:07,250
I suppose if you ask her
what time she got home

347
00:15:07,318 --> 00:15:10,153
and if she checked
to see if I was asleep.

348
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:12,021
But other than that...

349
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:25,034
Uh, you mind if I ask
what size shoe you wear?

350
00:15:25,102 --> 00:15:26,436
Ten.

351
00:15:26,504 --> 00:15:27,637
What does that matter?

352
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:29,272
ALLISON:
The police found
a shoe print outside

353
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,742
Earl Sanderson's--
the man who was shot.

354
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,245
It was the same brand and the
same size that you're wearing.

355
00:15:35,312 --> 00:15:37,213
Wait a second.

356
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:39,949
Everyone has these.

357
00:15:40,017 --> 00:15:43,019
Look, Mrs. Dubois,
you'd tell me

358
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:45,755
if I was in some kind
of trouble, right?

359
00:15:45,823 --> 00:15:46,790
You'd help me?

360
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:48,258
(door opens)

361
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:51,661
Mom.

362
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:52,996
Casey, wait outside.

363
00:15:53,063 --> 00:15:54,297
Mom, this is...

364
00:15:54,365 --> 00:15:55,398
I know who they are.

365
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:57,000
Just pick up your things
and wait outside.

366
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:58,435
ALLISON,
Mrs. Covington,

367
00:15:58,502 --> 00:15:59,936
my name is Allison Dubois.

368
00:16:00,004 --> 00:16:00,970
My daughter and your son
are friends.

369
00:16:01,038 --> 00:16:01,971
I know who you are.

370
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,139
I know who both
of you are.

371
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:04,140
The principal
called me.

372
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,676
Why are you questioning my son?

373
00:16:06,744 --> 00:16:07,677
What's this about?

374
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:09,012
We received a tip

375
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:10,914
about a young man
matching your son's description

376
00:16:10,981 --> 00:16:12,982
at the scene of a homicide
two nights ago.

377
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:15,852
This is a joke.

378
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,220
My son?

379
00:16:17,288 --> 00:16:19,722
Mrs. Covington, no one's
accusing your son of anything.

380
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,091
We're just trying to ascertain
if he knew this man.

381
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:24,594
You come marching
into a public school,

382
00:16:24,662 --> 00:16:28,131
question a 17-year-old
without notifying his parents,

383
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,767
without giving him the chance
to consult an attorney?

384
00:16:30,835 --> 00:16:32,669
Honestly, we offered
to let him call you.

385
00:16:32,736 --> 00:16:35,939
Excuse me,
Detective Whoever You Are,

386
00:16:36,006 --> 00:16:38,374
this is still America, isn't it?

387
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:40,109
This boy is
an honor student.

388
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:41,444
This boy is
a national scholar.

389
00:16:41,512 --> 00:16:44,113
And you ambush him at school

390
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:46,783
to talk to him
about a homicide?

391
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:48,351
Like some kind of thug?

392
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:50,520
What is the name
of your supervisor?

393
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:52,789
You can just call
the chief of police, ma'am.

394
00:16:52,857 --> 00:16:55,258
I think I will.

395
00:16:55,326 --> 00:16:57,627
And I think I'll call
my attorney, too.

396
00:16:57,695 --> 00:17:00,530
And if you still have
any questions for me or my son,

397
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:03,800
you should just feel free
to run them by him first.

398
00:17:03,868 --> 00:17:07,637
Oh, and I'd appreciate it
if, in the future, you,

399
00:17:07,705 --> 00:17:11,407
your daughter, your entire
family stay away from my son.

400
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:13,076
Just stay away.

401
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,013
(door slams)

402
00:17:17,081 --> 00:17:19,449
Well, that was productive.

403
00:17:19,517 --> 00:17:21,551
Lee, he's hiding something.

404
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,119
Didn't you see
the look on his face

405
00:17:23,187 --> 00:17:24,521
when you asked him
about his shoes?

406
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:26,189
Allison, it's not like
it's a particularly

407
00:17:26,257 --> 00:17:28,691
expensive or
unique shoe.

408
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:30,693
And size ten is like
saying I'm a righty.

409
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:32,762
He was there, Lee, I saw him.

410
00:17:34,598 --> 00:17:36,499
Hey, wait, Lee, wait.

411
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:37,567
She's still out there.

412
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,208
Lee, look.

413
00:17:45,276 --> 00:17:47,577
SCANLON:
What am I looking at?

414
00:17:47,645 --> 00:17:49,646
Hmm?

415
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:53,683
No, nothing.

416
00:17:53,751 --> 00:17:54,817
I'm sorry.

417
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:55,885
(doorbell rings)

418
00:17:58,923 --> 00:18:00,857
I'm coming, I'm coming!

419
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:01,958
Mr. Dubois?

420
00:18:02,026 --> 00:18:04,260
My name is Lloyd Darby.

421
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:05,295
You recognize me?

422
00:18:05,362 --> 00:18:07,330
I'm betting
that you do.

423
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:12,068
A lot of people
recognize me these days.

424
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:14,470
I take it you're aware
that a young lady

425
00:18:14,538 --> 00:18:16,639
who lives in this house
has been filming me,

426
00:18:16,707 --> 00:18:18,374
putting the videos
on the Internet?

427
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:19,842
Yeah, that's my daughter.

428
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,146
Uh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

429
00:18:23,213 --> 00:18:25,248
I-I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Darby.

430
00:18:25,316 --> 00:18:28,685
Um, I can assure you,
the video is down, it's gone.

431
00:18:28,752 --> 00:18:30,954
My wife and I just found out
about this last night.

432
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:32,455
And if there's anything
that we can do,

433
00:18:32,523 --> 00:18:34,591
if there's any way that we can
make this up to you...

434
00:18:34,658 --> 00:18:36,726
You know how many people
have watched that video?

435
00:18:36,794 --> 00:18:41,164
My second cousin in
Maine sent me the link.

436
00:18:41,231 --> 00:18:44,701
People point at me
in the supermarket.

437
00:18:44,768 --> 00:18:47,470
They laugh at me
when I'm in my car.

438
00:18:47,538 --> 00:18:51,007
Does your daughter have
some reason to dislike me?

439
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:52,308
No, no, no, no.
Absolutely not.

440
00:18:52,376 --> 00:18:53,476
I mean, I know

441
00:18:53,544 --> 00:18:56,179
I'm not the most
graceful man in the world.

442
00:18:56,246 --> 00:18:58,348
I know I'm carrying
a few extra pounds.

443
00:18:58,415 --> 00:19:00,817
But I don't think I deserve
to be reminded of that

444
00:19:00,884 --> 00:19:02,251
every time I leave my house.

445
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,120
No, absolutely not.

446
00:19:04,188 --> 00:19:07,123
I need you to understand,

447
00:19:07,191 --> 00:19:10,627
if I ever find myself
on the Internet again,

448
00:19:10,694 --> 00:19:14,897
if your daughter
ever violates my privacy,

449
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:17,367
I'll have no choice
but to sue you.

450
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:19,369
I've already been in touch
with a lawyer.

451
00:19:19,436 --> 00:19:22,105
Please don't
give me a reason

452
00:19:22,172 --> 00:19:24,641
to have to contact him again.

453
00:19:33,751 --> 00:19:37,020
It just keeps going
right to voice mail.

454
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,489
Hey, Ashton Kutcher,
tomorrow's garbage day.

455
00:19:39,556 --> 00:19:40,590
Cans are already out front.

456
00:19:40,658 --> 00:19:42,425
(Bridgette sighs)

457
00:19:44,261 --> 00:19:45,495
All right, that's it.

458
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:47,130
I'm calling the police.
Ariel's still not home.

459
00:19:47,197 --> 00:19:48,197
It's after 8:30.

460
00:19:48,265 --> 00:19:49,365
No, no, no, no.

461
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:50,733
Don't do that.
She's fine, really.

462
00:19:50,801 --> 00:19:54,303
She's just mad, like
you said she would be.

463
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:55,471
It's my fault.

464
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:57,206
I-I dealt with this
whole thing so stupidly.

465
00:19:57,274 --> 00:19:59,909
I should have spoken with her,
let her know what was going on.

466
00:19:59,977 --> 00:20:02,345
Be that as it may, she's still
not home, it's a school night.

467
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:03,346
I'm worried.

468
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:04,914
Ariel is home.

469
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:07,483
She's outside in a car
with her boyfriend.

470
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,718
(door opens)

471
00:20:08,786 --> 00:20:09,852
Ariel!

472
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,321
(door slams)

473
00:20:12,389 --> 00:20:13,389
(knocking)

474
00:20:13,457 --> 00:20:14,524
ALLISON:
Ariel.

475
00:20:14,591 --> 00:20:16,592
Go away.

476
00:20:19,496 --> 00:20:20,963
Ariel.

477
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:24,300
I only came home because I knew
that Daddy would be worried.

478
00:20:24,368 --> 00:20:28,304
Bridgette and Marie
would be worried.

479
00:20:28,372 --> 00:20:30,440
Okay.

480
00:20:30,507 --> 00:20:32,875
The thing is, I...

481
00:20:32,943 --> 00:20:35,778
I wanted to tell you,
I did something wrong.

482
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:39,649
You sure did.

483
00:20:39,717 --> 00:20:41,584
No, I mean...

484
00:20:41,652 --> 00:20:43,319
honey, I should have
spoken with you first,

485
00:20:43,387 --> 00:20:45,955
let you know what was going
on-- that I had this dream,

486
00:20:46,023 --> 00:20:47,790
that I had to question
your friend...

487
00:20:47,858 --> 00:20:50,993
No, see, you didn't
have to do that.

488
00:20:51,061 --> 00:20:53,796
Okay, you could have
come to me and asked me

489
00:20:53,864 --> 00:20:55,798
if he was capable
of being involved

490
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:59,102
with something like that,
of knowing anyone like that.

491
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:01,404
I saw him following
that man that died.

492
00:21:01,472 --> 00:21:02,872
I saw him
carrying a gun.

493
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,507
You didn't see it.

494
00:21:04,575 --> 00:21:07,176
Okay, you dreamt it,
and you're wrong.

495
00:21:07,244 --> 00:21:09,312
You don't know him, I do.

496
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:10,379
Well, that's
another thing.

497
00:21:10,447 --> 00:21:11,481
I don't want you
seeing him anymore.

498
00:21:11,548 --> 00:21:13,249
What?!
He had a gun, Ariel!

499
00:21:13,317 --> 00:21:14,917
In your dream!

500
00:21:14,985 --> 00:21:17,887
Okay, which isn't real!

501
00:21:17,955 --> 00:21:19,655
And you can't make me
not see him.

502
00:21:19,723 --> 00:21:20,923
Don't test me.

503
00:21:20,991 --> 00:21:22,925
No, no, no!
Where are you going with that?!

504
00:21:22,993 --> 00:21:24,494
You can have
this back

505
00:21:24,561 --> 00:21:27,864
as soon as you agree
to take my calls.

506
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:30,700
(door closes)

507
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:51,320
(car door opens and closes)

508
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:52,822
WOMAN:
Casey.

509
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,057
(footsteps approaching)

510
00:21:56,226 --> 00:21:58,661
Why didn't you
come home tonight?

511
00:22:01,165 --> 00:22:03,766
Your father and I
have been worried sick.

512
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:06,135
He went looking for you
at school.

513
00:22:07,337 --> 00:22:09,405
Look at me.

514
00:22:09,473 --> 00:22:13,176
You promised me you
wouldn't come here anymore.

515
00:22:14,545 --> 00:22:16,479
They knew I was lying.

516
00:22:16,547 --> 00:22:19,215
Ariel's mom, that detective.

517
00:22:19,283 --> 00:22:22,084
They could tell I knew
the man in the picture.

518
00:22:22,152 --> 00:22:24,487
But you weren't... lying.

519
00:22:24,555 --> 00:22:27,757
<i>You don't know that man;
you only think you do.</i>

520
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:30,326
Don't tell me what I know.

521
00:22:31,495 --> 00:22:32,795
That man,

522
00:22:32,863 --> 00:22:34,664
Earl Sanderson,

523
00:22:34,731 --> 00:22:35,965
he kidnapped me,

524
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:39,502
he threw my in a hole,
he covered me in concrete.

525
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,904
Right here.

526
00:22:41,972 --> 00:22:44,006
Right here 17 years ago.

527
00:22:44,074 --> 00:22:45,274
Casey,

528
00:22:45,342 --> 00:22:47,276
listen to me.

529
00:22:47,344 --> 00:22:49,278
This thing you keep
telling yourself,

530
00:22:49,346 --> 00:22:50,746
it's not real.

531
00:22:50,814 --> 00:22:52,782
You're not
Angelo Filipelli.

532
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:56,719
I know you don't
believe me.

533
00:22:58,188 --> 00:23:01,190
But I died, Mom.

534
00:23:01,258 --> 00:23:04,827
I died here 17 years ago.

535
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:08,164
I died the day I was born.

536
00:23:08,232 --> 00:23:09,899
(soft gasp)

537
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:28,601
What is that?

538
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:30,603
It's Angelo Filipelli.

539
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:32,538
It's you.

540
00:23:32,606 --> 00:23:34,540
<i>Those are X rays</i>

541
00:23:34,608 --> 00:23:36,409
generated by
ground radar.

542
00:23:36,477 --> 00:23:38,611
I convinced the
police to use them

543
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:41,814
outside the old Sheridan's
Pharmacy in Glendale.

544
00:23:41,882 --> 00:23:43,816
I was certain we
would find nothing.

545
00:23:43,884 --> 00:23:46,085
(chuckles)

546
00:23:46,153 --> 00:23:48,688
And then there it was.

547
00:23:48,755 --> 00:23:51,257
A skeleton.

548
00:23:51,325 --> 00:23:53,392
<i>Someone is
buried in there.</i>

549
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,528
What difference does it make?

550
00:23:55,596 --> 00:23:57,063
Why do you care?

551
00:23:57,131 --> 00:24:00,533
(sighs):
Well... I think that you did
something really horrible,

552
00:24:00,601 --> 00:24:04,003
something you may have to pay
for for the rest of your life,

553
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:05,805
and I want to help you.

554
00:24:07,107 --> 00:24:10,109
You really think I killed
that guy, don't you?

555
00:24:13,347 --> 00:24:16,482
I've always known...

556
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:21,787
as long as I can remember,
my name is not Kyle Covington.

557
00:24:21,855 --> 00:24:24,090
It's Angelo Filipelli.

558
00:24:24,158 --> 00:24:25,925
And I don't know why.

559
00:24:25,993 --> 00:24:27,660
Okay? It just is.

560
00:24:27,728 --> 00:24:29,929
I know all about his life.

561
00:24:29,997 --> 00:24:32,665
I can do the things he could do.

562
00:24:32,733 --> 00:24:35,034
When I was five,
I could fix a car.

563
00:24:35,102 --> 00:24:37,103
Okay? I just could.

564
00:24:37,171 --> 00:24:38,371
Check it out.

565
00:24:38,438 --> 00:24:40,673
Angelo Filipelli was a mechanic.

566
00:24:40,741 --> 00:24:44,310
I know about
how he died, too.

567
00:24:44,378 --> 00:24:48,080
He was killed...

568
00:24:48,148 --> 00:24:50,516
<i>I was killed...</i>

569
00:24:50,584 --> 00:24:54,820
by a tall guy with
a limp and a ponytail.

570
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,456
(sighs)

571
00:24:57,524 --> 00:25:00,860
This doesn't surprise me at all.

572
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,528
(sighs)

573
00:25:02,596 --> 00:25:05,264
I go there all the time.

574
00:25:05,332 --> 00:25:07,667
I just stare at it.

575
00:25:08,835 --> 00:25:11,704
One time, I'm there, and...

576
00:25:11,772 --> 00:25:14,907
this man shows up.

577
00:25:14,975 --> 00:25:16,909
I knew who he was.

578
00:25:16,977 --> 00:25:20,279
He was still wearing
that stupid ponytail.

579
00:25:20,347 --> 00:25:23,049
I followed him
back to his apartment.

580
00:25:23,116 --> 00:25:24,951
You know, I kept wondering

581
00:25:25,018 --> 00:25:27,954
if there was something
I was supposed to do.

582
00:25:28,021 --> 00:25:30,122
Kill him, maybe?

583
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:34,227
But I'm no killer.

584
00:25:34,294 --> 00:25:38,197
Okay? And Angelo Filipelli,
he's no killer.

585
00:25:38,265 --> 00:25:40,733
Look, I'm telling you the truth.

586
00:25:40,801 --> 00:25:43,169
Mrs. Dubois,
you have to believe me.

587
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:44,470
(knocking)

588
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:48,574
Does she know
about all this?

589
00:25:48,642 --> 00:25:50,076
(quietly):
No.

590
00:25:50,143 --> 00:25:52,345
Look, if it's okay,
we have a class together,

591
00:25:52,412 --> 00:25:55,281
and I just don't want her
to get in any more trouble.

592
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:56,616
No, it's okay.

593
00:25:56,683 --> 00:25:58,384
Tell her I said so.

594
00:26:11,932 --> 00:26:14,166
So, what'd she want?

595
00:26:15,736 --> 00:26:17,670
You know what she wanted.

596
00:26:17,738 --> 00:26:20,373
They think
I killed that guy.

597
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,008
(sighs)

598
00:26:22,075 --> 00:26:23,442
I hate this.

599
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,144
Okay? I'm not a murderer.

600
00:26:25,212 --> 00:26:26,679
I didn't shoot
anybody, okay?

601
00:26:26,747 --> 00:26:27,847
I couldn't have.

602
00:26:27,914 --> 00:26:29,181
I don't have a gun.

603
00:26:29,249 --> 00:26:30,783
I-I've never
even seen a gun.

604
00:26:30,851 --> 00:26:32,685
I know.

605
00:26:33,687 --> 00:26:36,722
Look, maybe your
parents were right.

606
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:39,058
Maybe we should
leave each other
alone for a while.

607
00:26:39,126 --> 00:26:40,559
(exhales)

608
00:26:40,627 --> 00:26:42,361
Casey...

609
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:46,065
Casey, I'm not my mother.

610
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:48,501
Okay? I know you...

611
00:26:48,568 --> 00:26:52,104
and I know that you
could never hurt anybody.

612
00:27:23,403 --> 00:27:25,905
Thanks for
believing in me.

613
00:27:25,972 --> 00:27:27,740
We should get going.

614
00:27:27,808 --> 00:27:30,343
Class started a
few minutes ago.

615
00:27:31,578 --> 00:27:33,279
You coming?

616
00:27:33,347 --> 00:27:34,880
(phone rings in distance)

617
00:27:34,948 --> 00:27:36,615
Joseph Dubois?

618
00:27:36,683 --> 00:27:39,251
Yeah, that's me.
Can I help you?

619
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,320
You've been served.

620
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:47,193
(aerosol spritzing)

621
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,596
(hornets buzzing, man yelling)

622
00:27:50,664 --> 00:27:51,931
No! No!

623
00:27:51,998 --> 00:27:53,933
(buzzing, yelling continue)

624
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,434
Hey.

625
00:27:55,502 --> 00:27:57,370
(buzzing, yelling continue)

626
00:27:59,206 --> 00:28:02,575
(buzzing, yelling continue)

627
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,145
(turns video off)
You defied us?

628
00:28:06,213 --> 00:28:07,913
I wasn't going to,

629
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:10,850
but then I had this dream,
and...

630
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:13,352
everything that
happened in the video

631
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,621
pretty much happened
in the dream first.

632
00:28:15,689 --> 00:28:20,192
Except that in the dream,
I saw myself taping everything,

633
00:28:20,227 --> 00:28:22,728
even though you told me not to.

634
00:28:22,796 --> 00:28:24,864
And in the dream,
after the hornets

635
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:26,999
chased the guy away,

636
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:30,603
he came back and thanked me
for putting it all on tape

637
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,571
<i>and for getting it
on the Internet.</i>

638
00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:33,739
Wow, really?

639
00:28:33,807 --> 00:28:35,574
Now, you expect us
to believe that?

640
00:28:35,642 --> 00:28:37,943
It's the truth!
No, it's not the
truth, Bridgette,

641
00:28:38,011 --> 00:28:40,146
because the man that
you taped, Mr. Darby,

642
00:28:40,213 --> 00:28:42,782
is so upset with it
that he's suing us

643
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:44,183
for defamation
of character.

644
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:45,184
Is that bad?

645
00:28:45,252 --> 00:28:47,052
It could end up
costing us a lot

646
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,221
of time and a lot
of money, darling.

647
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:50,823
Well, the one bright
spot in all this,

648
00:28:50,891 --> 00:28:52,825
if there is a bright
spot, is that you only

649
00:28:52,893 --> 00:28:54,560
taped him in public places.

650
00:28:54,628 --> 00:28:58,564
So technically, his privacy
wasn't violated, I think.

651
00:28:58,632 --> 00:29:01,567
So we may not be in any trouble?

652
00:29:01,635 --> 00:29:05,104
No, no, no, no, this is
gonna cost us something
before this is all over.

653
00:29:05,172 --> 00:29:08,407
None of it changes the
fact that we told you
not to do something,

654
00:29:08,475 --> 00:29:09,608
and you did it anyway.

655
00:29:09,676 --> 00:29:11,577
ARIEL:
Mom?

656
00:29:11,645 --> 00:29:13,412
Ariel.

657
00:29:14,748 --> 00:29:17,049
I-I need to talk to you.

658
00:29:22,255 --> 00:29:24,056
(door opens)

659
00:29:24,124 --> 00:29:26,292
She doing better?

660
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,860
(sighs):
Not really.

661
00:29:27,928 --> 00:29:32,064
I... got her to stop crying
for a little while, at least.

662
00:29:32,132 --> 00:29:35,634
Then she'd go over it
again, and she'd get...

663
00:29:35,702 --> 00:29:38,904
sad that somebody she
cared about lied to her.

664
00:29:38,972 --> 00:29:41,073
Maybe even
killed a man.

665
00:29:41,141 --> 00:29:43,008
No.

666
00:29:43,076 --> 00:29:45,811
I'm still hoping not.

667
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:49,181
I got an e-mail back
from the lawyer.

668
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:50,549
It's like I thought--

669
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:52,818
he says the guy
really has no case.

670
00:29:52,886 --> 00:29:54,086
Well, that's good.

671
00:29:54,154 --> 00:29:56,489
Yeah, but it still doesn't
get us out of having

672
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:58,824
to go to court, and
it still doesn't get us

673
00:29:58,892 --> 00:30:01,660
out of paying the lawyers
and missing work.

674
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,597
So he suggested that we
should offer a settlement.

675
00:30:04,664 --> 00:30:06,565
We're gonna meet with
Darby's lawyers tomorrow

676
00:30:06,633 --> 00:30:08,701
and see if we can
work something out.

677
00:30:08,768 --> 00:30:10,836
How much "working out"
are we talking here?

678
00:30:10,904 --> 00:30:12,972
He suggested
we offer $5,000

679
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,574
and then go up to
$7,500 if we have to.

680
00:30:15,642 --> 00:30:18,777
Doesn't this guy know
we just bought a new car?

681
00:30:18,845 --> 00:30:21,480
(cell phone playing ringtones)

682
00:30:25,552 --> 00:30:27,520
Hey, Lee.
What's going on?

683
00:30:27,587 --> 00:30:29,822
Based on your tip,
we were able to get a warrant

684
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,390
to search
the Covington's residence.

685
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:34,293
Found the .38 revolver
right where you said it'd be.

686
00:30:34,361 --> 00:30:35,728
Ballistics says it's a match

687
00:30:35,795 --> 00:30:39,732
for the weapon that
killed Earl Sanderson.

688
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:41,433
(sighs):
And, uh..

689
00:30:41,501 --> 00:30:42,735
we've just
filed charges.

690
00:30:42,802 --> 00:30:44,236
Thought you'd
like to know.

691
00:30:45,605 --> 00:30:47,973
(quietly):
Thanks, Lee.

692
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:49,542
(beep)

693
00:30:53,313 --> 00:30:55,414
They just found the gun.

694
00:30:55,482 --> 00:30:57,416
Casey's gun.

695
00:30:57,484 --> 00:31:00,219
It was the one that was
used to kill Sanderson.

696
00:31:00,287 --> 00:31:01,554
Should we tell Ariel?

697
00:31:01,621 --> 00:31:03,589
No.

698
00:31:03,657 --> 00:31:06,625
She's been through so much.

699
00:31:06,693 --> 00:31:08,827
We'll tell her
in the morning.

700
00:31:08,895 --> 00:31:11,897
(long sigh)

701
00:31:14,935 --> 00:31:16,268
(sighs)

702
00:31:31,318 --> 00:31:33,619
You look good, Nance.

703
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:38,090
Angelo.

704
00:31:38,158 --> 00:31:40,092
You look good, too.

705
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,827
Sit down.

706
00:31:48,234 --> 00:31:51,770
The guy you're with must be
taking good care of you.

707
00:31:51,838 --> 00:31:55,107
You have to stop calling me.

708
00:31:55,175 --> 00:31:56,742
(chuckles)

709
00:31:57,777 --> 00:31:59,445
Says who?

710
00:32:01,381 --> 00:32:05,050
Angelo, that girl
you're trying to charm...

711
00:32:05,118 --> 00:32:07,252
she doesn't live here anymore.

712
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,456
I haven't touched drugs
for two years.

713
00:32:12,726 --> 00:32:14,893
This is the last time
we're gonna see each other.

714
00:32:14,961 --> 00:32:17,296
Maybe, maybe not.

715
00:32:17,364 --> 00:32:19,832
That baby you're
carrying around...

716
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:22,434
we both know that it's
not your husband's.

717
00:32:22,502 --> 00:32:26,005
You can't expect me
to just disappear.

718
00:32:26,072 --> 00:32:29,108
That night was a mistake.

719
00:32:29,175 --> 00:32:30,909
One mistake.

720
00:32:30,977 --> 00:32:33,746
And I am not
gonna make another one.

721
00:32:33,813 --> 00:32:37,750
I got a nice life for myself,
I got a nice life for my baby.

722
00:32:37,817 --> 00:32:40,819
Nice things. Nice people.

723
00:32:40,887 --> 00:32:42,888
And I am not going
to mess that up.

724
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:47,760
Look, you're not going to come
out of this empty-handed.

725
00:32:47,827 --> 00:32:51,830
I can pay you some money,
but there is no way

726
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:54,500
you are going to be
a part of my son's life.

727
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:56,969
It's a boy?

728
00:32:57,037 --> 00:32:58,671
Lunch is on me.

729
00:32:58,738 --> 00:33:00,039
Don't call again.

730
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:05,377
What are you going
to name him?

731
00:33:05,445 --> 00:33:07,713
Kyle.

732
00:33:07,781 --> 00:33:10,716
It's Michael's
father's name.

733
00:33:21,828 --> 00:33:23,829
(sighs)

734
00:33:24,898 --> 00:33:26,465
He won't take the money.

735
00:33:26,533 --> 00:33:28,534
He won't go away.

736
00:33:31,237 --> 00:33:33,338
You need
to take care of it, Earl.

737
00:33:33,406 --> 00:33:35,407
Tonight.

738
00:33:51,907 --> 00:33:53,607
You waiting to see your son?

739
00:33:53,675 --> 00:33:56,777
How dare you
sit next to me,

740
00:33:56,845 --> 00:33:59,980
pretending to give a damn
about me or my son.

741
00:34:00,048 --> 00:34:01,716
You're the reason
he's in jail.

742
00:34:01,783 --> 00:34:04,452
Now, kindly
leave me in peace.

743
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:06,087
Okay, well...

744
00:34:06,154 --> 00:34:08,622
Casey won't be
back there long.

745
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:11,158
At this point, we're pretty
certain that he didn't do it.

746
00:34:13,195 --> 00:34:16,864
Are you serious?

747
00:34:16,932 --> 00:34:19,667
We know who the
guilty party is.

748
00:34:19,735 --> 00:34:23,337
We're just waiting to see if
we can get her to confess.

749
00:34:23,405 --> 00:34:26,941
You know, it seems
that 17 years ago,

750
00:34:27,008 --> 00:34:29,677
the killer hired a man
named Earl Sanderson

751
00:34:29,745 --> 00:34:32,580
to murder a man named
Angelo Filipelli.

752
00:34:32,614 --> 00:34:35,816
Angelo Filipelli
was her child's father,

753
00:34:35,884 --> 00:34:38,085
but she didn't want
her husband to find out.

754
00:34:38,153 --> 00:34:40,521
I have no idea
who you're talking about.

755
00:34:40,589 --> 00:34:42,123
Oh, I think you do.

756
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,524
(chuckles)

757
00:34:43,592 --> 00:34:45,526
I spent the whole morning
going through bank records.

758
00:34:45,594 --> 00:34:47,728
Yours. Earl Sanderson's.

759
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:49,430
Hey, you want to hear
a funny coincidence?

760
00:34:49,498 --> 00:34:51,932
Starting in 1992,

761
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,702
around the time Angelo
Filipelli went missing,

762
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:57,071
Earl Sanderson started
living off of cash

763
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:59,373
from a mysterious
benefactor.

764
00:34:59,441 --> 00:35:02,309
The amounts of his deposits

765
00:35:02,377 --> 00:35:04,512
and the amounts of
your withdrawals

766
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:06,046
match up pretty nicely.

767
00:35:06,114 --> 00:35:09,283
Another funny thing?

768
00:35:09,351 --> 00:35:12,052
The size of
Sanderson's deposits

769
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,922
got bigger and bigger
year after year.

770
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,925
So did the size of
your withdrawals.

771
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:21,262
Till one day,
Sanderson turns up dead

772
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:24,932
and you stop
making withdrawals.

773
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,333
So, what?

774
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:28,269
Was he asking for more money

775
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:29,737
than you could hide
from your husband?

776
00:35:29,805 --> 00:35:32,673
How does this work?

777
00:35:32,741 --> 00:35:33,774
They know I'm here.

778
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:34,975
Are they going
to call my name?

779
00:35:35,043 --> 00:35:36,143
Casey told the police

780
00:35:36,211 --> 00:35:38,579
that the gun used
was a family weapon,

781
00:35:38,647 --> 00:35:40,614
although when we
questioned your husband,

782
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:42,416
he claimed he didn't
know anything about it.

783
00:35:42,484 --> 00:35:44,452
It was your
gun, wasn't it?

784
00:35:46,988 --> 00:35:49,256
(sighs)

785
00:35:49,324 --> 00:35:50,724
(chuckles)

786
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:52,059
What? You find
this amusing?

787
00:35:52,127 --> 00:35:55,796
I find it strange.

788
00:35:55,864 --> 00:35:57,765
You're making all
kinds of accusations.

789
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:00,768
We're in a police station,
but no one is arresting me.

790
00:36:00,836 --> 00:36:02,136
(chuckles)

791
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:03,504
You know what
I find strange?

792
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:05,840
You love your son.

793
00:36:05,907 --> 00:36:08,442
You were even willing
to murder someone

794
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,011
to make sure that he
had a better life.

795
00:36:11,112 --> 00:36:14,014
Now you're willing
to let him go to jail

796
00:36:14,082 --> 00:36:16,383
for a crime he
didn't commit?

797
00:36:18,253 --> 00:36:20,821
Let me tell you
something about my son.

798
00:36:22,357 --> 00:36:25,426
Casey is a very disturbed boy.

799
00:36:25,494 --> 00:36:27,695
Ever since he was a child,

800
00:36:27,762 --> 00:36:30,297
he's believed he's someone
other than who he is.

801
00:36:30,365 --> 00:36:33,400
I can't tell you
how many doctors he's seen.

802
00:36:33,468 --> 00:36:36,337
How much testing,
consulting...

803
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:39,106
Perhaps now,
the court will see to it

804
00:36:39,174 --> 00:36:41,909
that he gets
the treatment he needs.

805
00:36:41,977 --> 00:36:43,143
(chuckles)

806
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:45,379
Wow. You are really
putting a lot of faith

807
00:36:45,447 --> 00:36:47,281
in an insanity defense.

808
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:49,683
You seem to be suggesting

809
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:52,152
that I have some choice
in this matter,

810
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,621
that there are options here.

811
00:36:53,688 --> 00:36:56,156
There are no options here.

812
00:36:56,224 --> 00:36:57,491
Think about it.

813
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:59,426
Aren't there?

814
00:36:59,494 --> 00:37:01,228
Oh, I think there are.

815
00:37:01,296 --> 00:37:04,932
Right now, your son
is back there getting
a simple DNA test,

816
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,236
and I think we both know
that that test is going to show

817
00:37:09,304 --> 00:37:11,438
that Casey is not
your husband's son.

818
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:15,109
I don't want to
do this to Casey.

819
00:37:15,176 --> 00:37:16,477
I don't want to do
this to your husband.

820
00:37:16,545 --> 00:37:18,779
But I will do it
if I have to.

821
00:37:18,847 --> 00:37:20,347
And then what?

822
00:37:20,415 --> 00:37:22,449
What? Everything that
you've worked for--

823
00:37:22,517 --> 00:37:24,518
everything that
you've killed for--

824
00:37:24,586 --> 00:37:26,954
it all goes away.

825
00:37:27,022 --> 00:37:29,423
Along with your family.

826
00:37:29,491 --> 00:37:32,726
Along with anyone
who loves you.

827
00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:36,630
Or...

828
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:41,669
I will make sure that
that DNA is disposed of,

829
00:37:41,736 --> 00:37:44,538
that it is never tested.

830
00:37:44,606 --> 00:37:46,640
At least, in this way,

831
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:49,109
Casey will still
have a father.

832
00:37:49,177 --> 00:37:51,245
Still have a family.

833
00:37:51,313 --> 00:37:54,048
He will still
have a future.

834
00:37:56,651 --> 00:37:58,752
And...

835
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,221
if I were to confess?

836
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:06,760
Maybe offer, um...

837
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:08,829
a different motive?

838
00:38:12,867 --> 00:38:16,503
Well, I will
keep your secret.

839
00:38:17,939 --> 00:38:19,940
I promise.

840
00:38:21,643 --> 00:38:23,644
(elevator bell dings)

841
00:38:33,622 --> 00:38:34,722
Mr. Dubois?

842
00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:37,157
Yeah. Mr. Darby. Hi.

843
00:38:37,225 --> 00:38:39,560
(both chuckling)

844
00:38:39,628 --> 00:38:42,963
Uh, my attorney, actually,
he isn't here yet, so...

845
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:44,465
I just, I--

846
00:38:44,532 --> 00:38:46,433
You know, I'd just like
to say again how sorry I am

847
00:38:46,501 --> 00:38:50,771
about all this and how-how
terrible my whole family feels.

848
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:52,306
It's all right, Mr. Dubois.
No. No.

849
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:53,941
No, it's not.
Yes. Yes it is.

850
00:38:54,009 --> 00:38:55,476
In fact,

851
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:57,745
um, maybe you should
call your attorney.

852
00:38:57,812 --> 00:39:00,381
I actually don't think we're
going to be needing attorneys.

853
00:39:00,448 --> 00:39:02,416
Uh, excuse me?

854
00:39:02,484 --> 00:39:03,751
(laughing)

855
00:39:03,818 --> 00:39:05,519
It's the funniest thing.

856
00:39:05,587 --> 00:39:08,689
Uh, Anna and I

857
00:39:08,757 --> 00:39:11,458
worked together
at a water park

858
00:39:11,526 --> 00:39:14,061
in Minnesota
the summer after college.

859
00:39:14,129 --> 00:39:16,730
Lost touch.
Years go by.

860
00:39:16,798 --> 00:39:19,199
I always thought
about her.

861
00:39:19,267 --> 00:39:21,035
Turns out,

862
00:39:21,102 --> 00:39:23,604
she always
thought about me.

863
00:39:23,672 --> 00:39:26,740
Then she saw your
daughter's video.

864
00:39:29,277 --> 00:39:30,511
Oh.

865
00:39:30,578 --> 00:39:31,945
Okay.
(both laughing)

866
00:39:32,013 --> 00:39:33,981
Great. Well,
who'd have thunk it?

867
00:39:34,049 --> 00:39:35,282
(laughing):
I know.

868
00:39:36,518 --> 00:39:39,353
Oh, my lawyer
thinks I'm crazy.

869
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:42,156
He told me I should
have taken your money.

870
00:39:42,223 --> 00:39:44,258
Squeezed you for a
little more, even.

871
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:46,193
But I don't know,
Mr. Dubois.

872
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:48,629
I mean, we are
neighbors, and...

873
00:39:50,331 --> 00:39:52,066
(elevator bell dings)

874
00:39:53,735 --> 00:39:58,505
today just doesn't feel
like a day for attorneys.

875
00:40:07,382 --> 00:40:10,217
(chuckles, clears throat)

876
00:40:11,352 --> 00:40:13,921
(both laughing)

877
00:40:15,423 --> 00:40:16,590
(elevator bell dings)

878
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:23,530
How is she?

879
00:40:25,934 --> 00:40:29,636
She's... amazing.

880
00:40:33,341 --> 00:40:35,843
She wants to see him again.

881
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,745
I told her it was okay.

882
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:40,180
But he lied to her.

883
00:40:40,248 --> 00:40:41,648
I know.

884
00:40:41,716 --> 00:40:43,717
She knows.

885
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,388
He took his mother's gun.
He followed that man.

886
00:40:48,456 --> 00:40:51,859
He stood outside his window
in his canvas high tops,

887
00:40:51,926 --> 00:40:53,927
but at the end
of the day,

888
00:40:53,995 --> 00:40:55,362
he couldn't do it.

889
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,698
He didn't have it in him.

890
00:40:57,766 --> 00:40:59,867
(sighs heavily)

891
00:40:59,934 --> 00:41:03,437
She just keeps saying how
confused he is, how sad.

892
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:05,639
His mother's in prison.

893
00:41:05,707 --> 00:41:08,008
That he can't make
sense of it all.

894
00:41:08,076 --> 00:41:10,911
How he knows
the things he knows,

895
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:15,115
how he knew where
Angelo Filipelli was buried.

896
00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:20,020
But here's what I know.

897
00:41:20,088 --> 00:41:23,590
I know he's a good kid.

898
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:29,630
And the rest of it,
I can't explain.

899
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:38,071
So you really can see me?

900
00:41:40,909 --> 00:41:42,910
They told me you could.

901
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:48,015
The way I heard it, kids
can only see people like me

902
00:41:48,082 --> 00:41:50,717
for a year, maybe
a year and a half.

903
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,089
We got a lot to pack
into that time.

904
00:41:56,157 --> 00:41:58,425
But you have to be
patient with me.

905
00:42:00,662 --> 00:42:03,163
'Cause I'm new at this.

906
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:05,232
Being a dad.

907
00:42:06,434 --> 00:42:07,935
Being dead.

908
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,041
I'm gonna come see you
every night, okay?

909
00:42:17,378 --> 00:42:19,446
Every night
till you can't see me anymore.

910
00:42:22,617 --> 00:42:24,484
That's gonna be
our special time.

911
00:42:24,552 --> 00:42:27,321
I'm gonna tell you
all about my life.

912
00:42:27,388 --> 00:42:30,390
The good... and the bad.

913
00:42:32,026 --> 00:42:34,027
All of it.

914
00:42:35,296 --> 00:42:38,966
I'm gonna try
and teach you stuff, too.

915
00:42:39,033 --> 00:42:41,602
But first things first.

916
00:42:41,669 --> 00:42:44,671
We got to talk
about this name of yours.

917
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:46,240
Your mom
and that guy she's with...

918
00:42:46,307 --> 00:42:47,474
(sniffles)

919
00:42:47,542 --> 00:42:50,644
I know they named you
something different.

920
00:42:50,712 --> 00:42:53,513
But when I'm around,

921
00:42:53,581 --> 00:42:55,916
I'm gonna call you the name
I would have given you.

922
00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:59,686
It's my granddad's name.

923
00:42:59,754 --> 00:43:01,388
(sniffles)

924
00:43:01,456 --> 00:43:03,457
My dad's name.

925
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:06,927
Your dad's name.

926
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:11,598
I'm gonna call
you Angelo.

927
00:43:11,666 --> 00:43:13,967
Angelo Filipelli.

928
00:43:14,035 --> 00:43:16,036
(gasps)

929
00:43:18,907 --> 00:43:20,841
(sighs)

930
00:43:20,909 --> 00:43:27,411
