1
00:00:01,397 --> 00:00:03,390
<i>Looks pretty tempting, doesn't it?</i>

2
00:00:03,843 --> 00:00:07,354
<i>But what if I told you that each one
of these delicious little morsels</i>

3
00:00:07,743 --> 00:00:09,843
<i>has almost a thousand calories?</i>

4
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,428
<i>Would it make you want one any less?</i>

5
00:00:13,165 --> 00:00:14,265
<i>Me, neither.</i>

6
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:15,931
<i>And that's normal.</i>

7
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:24,065
<i>We all want things
that we know are bad for us.</i>

8
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:31,969
<i>Everyone has dangerous fascinations
and unhealthy fixations.</i>

9
00:00:33,963 --> 00:00:37,005
<i>Some of them are a little harder
to explain than others.</i>

10
00:00:38,828 --> 00:00:41,576
<i>But most us know how to keep
our impulses in check.</i>

11
00:00:42,178 --> 00:00:45,211
<i>We use willpower to fight off
our darker instincts.</i>

12
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:49,643
<i>Unfortunately, for others,</i>

13
00:00:50,569 --> 00:00:52,469
<i>willpower just isn't enough.</i>

14
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:57,199
<i>The siren call of
one's own obsessions</i>

15
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,931
<i>is simply too strong to resist.</i>

16
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:13,301
<i>The thing we used to want...</i>

17
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,730
<i>... becomes the thing we now need.</i>

18
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:21,822
<i>Our obsession
becomes our compulsion.</i>

19
00:01:24,324 --> 00:01:26,174
<i>Until eventually we realize</i>

20
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:29,644
<i>pursuing the one thing
we want most in life</i>

21
00:01:31,808 --> 00:01:34,263
<i>has left us without
much of a life at all.</i>

22
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:38,026
<i>But in the end,</i>

23
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,513
<i>our compulsions are still there.</i>

24
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:44,920
<i>Even after they've pushed
us to the brink of death,</i>

25
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:47,807
<i>or guided us</i>

26
00:01:48,587 --> 00:01:51,300
<i>into places of unimaginable horror.</i>

27
00:01:58,395 --> 00:01:59,728
Okay. Don't be mad.

28
00:02:00,607 --> 00:02:03,325
I know, I know they're for
that bake sale at Bridgette's school,

29
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,454
but what can I say?
I couldn't resist.

30
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,114
- You want some?
- God, no.

31
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,070
I'm going to bed.

32
00:02:11,588 --> 00:02:13,801
What?
It was a cupcake.

33
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:05,731
Okay. Now you try.

34
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,029
What are you doing?

35
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:10,230
What's she doing?
What are you making her do?

36
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:12,900
I'm not making her do anything.
She likes it.

37
00:03:13,524 --> 00:03:14,924
Don't you like it?

38
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:18,447
Don't just stand there.
You know, fold some more.

39
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:20,463
Bridgette, that's your job.

40
00:03:20,588 --> 00:03:23,213
You're supposed to fold the laundry.
That's why you have an allowance.

41
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:25,788
It's not my job.
It's my responsibility.

42
00:03:26,202 --> 00:03:27,790
And I'm keeping that responsibility.

43
00:03:28,056 --> 00:03:30,440
I'm just outsourcing, that's all.

44
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:32,765
It's no big deal.
Everybody's doing it.

45
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,890
Mom!

46
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:35,475
Sorry. Not Mom.

47
00:03:35,974 --> 00:03:38,548
Feel free to continue fighting
till she gets here.

48
00:03:38,673 --> 00:03:41,345
Dad, Bridgette's making Marie
do her work folding the laundry.

49
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,599
She asked me how to fold socks.
That's all. And underwear.

50
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,102
And towels, and how
to put them in drawers.

51
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,125
You are such a liar.

52
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,565
Okay, well, maybe she didn't ask
about the drawers.

53
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:56,819
Hey, Marie, did you ask
Bridgette any of that?

54
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,573
You are never moving out of
that bottom bunk!

55
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,659
Hey, what is all the noise about?
Why isn't anybody eating?

56
00:04:04,215 --> 00:04:06,287
Why is all this laundry
still not folded?

57
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:09,646
And Bridgette, why are
your books not in your bag?

58
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,670
What is this?
I don't know.

59
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:16,338
It's a week old,
and it's marked urgent.

60
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:19,675
Well, then I guess it wasn't
really very urgent, was it?

61
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:22,261
Tomorrow's Parent-Teacher conference
has been rescheduled.

62
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:24,414
You're kidding!

63
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:26,777
I rearranged a meeting
so I could make that.

64
00:04:26,902 --> 00:04:30,060
I already told Mr. Sacks I can't make
rehearsal 'cause I have to baby-sit.

65
00:04:32,156 --> 00:04:35,608
It's not even 7:00, and I'm already
having a bad feeling about today.

66
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,921
I don't care.
Dad's got to go to work.

67
00:04:38,046 --> 00:04:40,182
I just got a text.
I got to meet Scanlon downtown.

68
00:04:40,307 --> 00:04:43,365
We're gonna talk about punishment later.
We've got to get breakfast going.

69
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,128
Nice work, doofus.

70
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:49,281
Well, I suppose there's
a bright side to all this.

71
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:51,379
We all have a free night.

72
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:53,913
Every single one of us
all here at the same time.

73
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:55,685
No meetings, no rehearsal.

74
00:04:56,044 --> 00:04:57,630
You're right, Dad!
That's great news!

75
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:00,023
It's not that great.

76
00:05:03,573 --> 00:05:05,695
Security guard stumbled
across the body.

77
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,893
We're thinking
it happened last night.

78
00:05:08,605 --> 00:05:10,809
Looks like they used
a baseball bat or a pipe.

79
00:05:13,154 --> 00:05:16,356
Normally, I'd start by asking his family
and friends if he had any enemies.

80
00:05:16,706 --> 00:05:19,601
Of course, to do that, I'd have to have
the first clue who this guy is.

81
00:05:19,726 --> 00:05:20,726
No wallet?

82
00:05:21,138 --> 00:05:23,251
Actually, it was right there
in his pocket.

83
00:05:23,484 --> 00:05:26,248
Only problem is, every piece
of ID he's carrying is fake.

84
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:27,952
Check out his fingers.

85
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,113
No fingerprints.

86
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:35,584
Who do you think did this?

87
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,734
I'm guessing since
he's carrying all that fake ID,

88
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:40,561
that his very severe mani
is just part of the package.

89
00:05:41,637 --> 00:05:44,829
This is a guy who clearly didn't want
anyone to know who he really was,

90
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:48,138
- which is why I called you.
- Coming through, Detective.

91
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,525
I was hoping maybe you'd see him
and, you know,

92
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,323
get some feeling,
have some instinct about who...

93
00:05:56,931 --> 00:05:59,274
... who he is, where he came from.

94
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:01,221
Who might have done this.

95
00:06:17,618 --> 00:06:19,168
Allison, you with me?

96
00:06:19,572 --> 00:06:22,435
Yeah. Of course. If I see anything,

97
00:06:23,365 --> 00:06:24,565
I'll call you.

98
00:06:27,738 --> 00:06:30,288
You see this old microwave over
here? You think it's okay if I just,

99
00:06:30,413 --> 00:06:33,036
you know, dig it out of the trash,
take it home with me?

100
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,153
Tell you what.
You help me figure out who

101
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:38,278
played percussion on this guy's noggin,
I'll even buy you a new one.

102
00:06:47,338 --> 00:06:48,486
Mr. Brewer?

103
00:06:50,146 --> 00:06:52,646
What you doing?
You gunning for my job?

104
00:06:54,058 --> 00:06:56,377
You trying to be an early bird
or something?

105
00:06:58,898 --> 00:07:00,198
I don't like it.

106
00:07:00,616 --> 00:07:01,717
Ambition.

107
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,166
Initiative.

108
00:07:04,016 --> 00:07:05,366
Makes me nervous.

109
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,010
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

110
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:09,845
I couldn't sleep.

111
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,992
I kept thinking about the problem
with the contact grid.

112
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:16,476
I know we've been going around and
around this for the past three weeks,

113
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,730
but...

114
00:07:18,177 --> 00:07:20,230
you know, suddenly at 3:00
this morning, I...

115
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:21,710
I had a...

116
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:26,941
This just came to you?

117
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:30,117
Well, the concept. I got in here
about an hour and a half ago,

118
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,201
and I started working on
the engineering.

119
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:34,981
Well...

120
00:07:35,658 --> 00:07:37,081
This-This is amazing.

121
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:42,628
Okay. Now I'm officially
threatened by your intellect.

122
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,138
Hey, what are you and Debbie
doing for dinner tomorrow night?

123
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,113
I mean, are you busy?
Do you have plans?

124
00:07:51,482 --> 00:07:55,140
I've been talking to my wife about
having you guys over since you got here.

125
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,391
Hello!

126
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:04,949
Gooey red stuff.
What did I miss? Spaghetti?

127
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:06,986
Ketchup for take-out.

128
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,531
- Okay. Where is everybody?
- Where?

129
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,069
It's late, Dad.
I put Bridgette and Marie down,

130
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:14,868
and Mom went out
to work in the garage.

131
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:16,842
Work in the garage?

132
00:08:20,553 --> 00:08:21,553
Al?

133
00:08:21,757 --> 00:08:22,757
Back here!

134
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:24,466
Hi.

135
00:08:24,828 --> 00:08:26,728
Ariel said you were in here.

136
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:28,433
What's going on?

137
00:08:28,823 --> 00:08:31,226
What are you doing?
What are you working on?

138
00:08:31,351 --> 00:08:33,637
I don't know.
You're gonna think it's silly.

139
00:08:34,017 --> 00:08:36,320
Looks like you're trying
to take apart an old microwave.

140
00:08:36,445 --> 00:08:40,192
That's exactly what I'm doing.
I'm taking apart anoldmicrowave.

141
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:43,069
I found this thing in the trash
at the crime scene this morning,

142
00:08:43,194 --> 00:08:46,442
and I suddenly got really curious
about the way these things work.

143
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,067
What do you mean? Just ask me.
They use radio waves

144
00:08:49,192 --> 00:08:52,379
to create a radiation that creates
excitement in the molecules in the food

145
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:55,325
and that heats it up and makes it cook.
We have one of these in the kitchen.

146
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:57,673
Well, not an old one like this.

147
00:08:58,468 --> 00:09:01,598
You know, I just want to look inside,
see how it does it.

148
00:09:01,723 --> 00:09:05,502
How you put food inside, it comes out
hot, but then the oven stays cool.

149
00:09:05,938 --> 00:09:07,038
Did you eat?

150
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:09,152
David and I ordered in.

151
00:09:09,277 --> 00:09:11,286
That reminds me.
Hey, don't be mad.

152
00:09:11,762 --> 00:09:14,392
I invited he and his wife Debbie
over tomorrow night for dinner.

153
00:09:14,517 --> 00:09:16,888
It's time, Allison. The guy relocated
here with his family

154
00:09:17,261 --> 00:09:19,176
- almost two months ago.
- Yeah, fine.

155
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:21,294
I'll make a roast.
Do they eat meat?

156
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:24,892
Yeah, he sure does. I mean, boy,
can he engineer. I mean, what a find.

157
00:09:26,407 --> 00:09:28,922
Couldn't you find a less
gross-looking microwave?

158
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:32,488
I mean, it looks like you can
catch a disease from that thing.

159
00:09:32,723 --> 00:09:34,160
I'll be in in a minute.

160
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:38,317
All right, fine. I've been kicked
out of bed nicer than that.

161
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:41,413
- I'll see you in a couple of minutes.
- See you in a couple of minutes.

162
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:10,917
Do you know that it's almost
3:00 in the morning?

163
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,664
Do you have any idea how much heat
this thing can generate?

164
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:16,575
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do.

165
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,654
I would say roughly enough to bake
a big potato in about seven minutes.

166
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:21,343
Can we go to bed?

167
00:10:22,928 --> 00:10:25,867
Allison, you've been out here
for almost six hours now.

168
00:10:26,612 --> 00:10:29,689
I don't know what this fascination
is with small appliances,

169
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,131
but you've got a big day tomorrow.
We both have big days.

170
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,318
We have people
coming over for dinner.

171
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:36,928
Oh, my God.

172
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:40,727
- What time did you say it was?
- It's 3:00 in the morning.

173
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:42,925
I don't even...

174
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:45,579
I don't even know what to say.

175
00:10:46,082 --> 00:10:49,042
I just suddenly got so fascinated
with that thing, I...

176
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:51,995
I kind of got lost in it.

177
00:10:54,549 --> 00:10:55,594
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:55,908 --> 00:10:57,058
I'm so sorry.

179
00:10:58,322 --> 00:10:59,991
<i>But only a single step</i>

180
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,745
<i>is the beginning of a new dialogue
between the United States...</i>

181
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,926
<i>The search continues
for Justice Heath Clemens,</i>

182
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:24,017
<i>a federal judge
on the 12th Circuit Court,</i>

183
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,476
<i>who was reported missing
yesterday afternoon.</i>

184
00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:29,270
<i>Anyone with information
on his whereabouts is urged to</i>

185
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,672
- <i>contact the authorities immediately.</i>
- Arlo! You in there?!

186
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:38,220
Arlo, quit tinkering
with that idiot box and come outside.

187
00:11:39,357 --> 00:11:40,866
I got something I want to show you.

188
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,075
Dad, I just saw this man
on the news.

189
00:11:48,044 --> 00:11:49,500
They're looking for him.

190
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:51,939
- His name's...
- He doesn't have a name!

191
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,783
He surrendered his right

192
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:57,617
to an identity

193
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,552
on the day he was sworn
onto that court.

194
00:12:01,374 --> 00:12:04,021
The day he agree
to become another cog

195
00:12:04,146 --> 00:12:06,306
in the machine
that is systematically destroying

196
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:09,227
everything and anything
that was ever good about this country!

197
00:12:10,556 --> 00:12:12,022
He's an extension of them.

198
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,760
A diseased limb.

199
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,910
You're a smart boy, Arlo.

200
00:12:19,158 --> 00:12:21,865
You know what a doctor would do
with a diseased limb, don't you?

201
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,450
Dad, please don't...

202
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:27,284
You want to know what
this robot does with his life?

203
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,833
He sits behind a bench
all day issuing rulings

204
00:12:33,098 --> 00:12:36,584
that take away the rights
of free citizens like you and me.

205
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:40,383
He gets paid to harass us,

206
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:42,645
to decide how we get
to live our lives.

207
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,153
Now, tell me, does that sound
like the kind of government you want?

208
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,836
Is that the way you want
your country run?

209
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:51,203
Dad, he's not the government.

210
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:54,243
He's just a man.
He's just a man trying to do his job.

211
00:12:55,921 --> 00:12:58,268
I'm sorry.
What was that last bit you said?

212
00:12:58,766 --> 00:13:01,166
'Cause I think
you were describing me.

213
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:15,293
- How are we supposed to eat this?
- With a fork.

214
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:17,421
It's not what I mean.

215
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,129
You forgot the syrup.

216
00:13:19,531 --> 00:13:21,716
It's all hard without the syrup.

217
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:27,159
- Here.
- Ketchup?

218
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,306
All right, knock yourself out
and help your sister, too.

219
00:13:36,411 --> 00:13:37,634
More, more!

220
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,857
All right, all right,
I'm giving you more.

221
00:13:43,195 --> 00:13:45,800
- How are we doing over there?
- Never better.

222
00:13:46,401 --> 00:13:48,598
No urge to take apart
the central air?

223
00:13:49,778 --> 00:13:53,241
Figure out how it is the air
comes in so hot, but comes out so cold?

224
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,130
Is something going on?

225
00:13:55,374 --> 00:13:56,510
Everything's fine.

226
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,766
I just... Mommy didn't get
a lot of sleep last night,

227
00:13:58,891 --> 00:14:00,629
and Daddy didn't get much either.

228
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:02,305
But everything's fine.

229
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:05,510
We still okay for tonight?
It's not too late to call it off.

230
00:14:06,158 --> 00:14:07,702
I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.

231
00:14:09,956 --> 00:14:12,730
I got to go down to City Hall,
show Scanlon something.

232
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:15,402
Then I'm heading right
to the store to go shopping.

233
00:14:15,527 --> 00:14:16,521
Hey, girls,

234
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:20,659
when Ariel comes in, can you be sure
to tell her she's got to clean her room?

235
00:14:20,784 --> 00:14:22,651
We have company coming tonight.

236
00:14:23,418 --> 00:14:26,156
I will be in the bathroom
taking apart the shower.

237
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,451
I'm just kidding.
Just kidding.

238
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,788
His name was Heath Clemens.
He was a federal judge.

239
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:37,019
The police think someone abducted him
from his house in Needles, California.

240
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:39,924
June of'85. So, what does any
of this have to do with me?

241
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:42,305
Did you see the part where
it said they discovered his body

242
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,308
a few weeks later in the desert, and no
one was ever arrested for the murder?

243
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:46,961
Yeah, I can read, Allison.

244
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,517
The man who killed him,
the man I saw slit his throat

245
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:51,544
was the same man
we discovered the other day,

246
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:53,934
laying in all that trash,
the one with no fingerprints.

247
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:56,895
When you say "saw,"
what you really mean was...

248
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,871
Dreamt.
What I really meant was dreamt.

249
00:14:59,996 --> 00:15:02,983
Don't... don't start on me today.
I had three hours of sleep last night.

250
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,478
Okay, easy.

251
00:15:06,237 --> 00:15:09,023
So what have we got?
We got a dead guy... no name.

252
00:15:09,364 --> 00:15:12,678
Now, we got another dead guy from
a long time ago who you say he killed.

253
00:15:13,081 --> 00:15:16,443
I guess that might explain
why he burned his own fingertips off.

254
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,590
Needles,
I guess we could make a few calls,

255
00:15:19,715 --> 00:15:22,683
send them a picture of our friend in
the morgue. See if anybody recalls him.

256
00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:24,281
He sounded like one of those,

257
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:26,829
those rightwing conspiracy
nuts who thinks

258
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:29,836
the government is out to get them,
take away all their personal freedom.

259
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:31,263
And he had a son.

260
00:15:32,071 --> 00:15:35,073
Well, he sounds like a pretty
unique character.

261
00:15:35,373 --> 00:15:37,373
Maybe someone will remember him.

262
00:16:28,746 --> 00:16:29,746
I'm home!

263
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:36,282
What in God's...?

264
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:39,515
Did the dishwasher break?
What's going on?

265
00:16:39,674 --> 00:16:41,298
Nope, it didn't break.

266
00:16:43,255 --> 00:16:45,338
Mom insisted she needed
some sheet metal screws

267
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,823
and the ones in the back of
the dishwasher were perfect.

268
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,716
Need?
Need for what?

269
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,618
Where is Mom?

270
00:16:54,617 --> 00:16:55,821
Where is dinner?

271
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,142
People are coming over.
They're going to be here any minute.

272
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:01,560
Yeah, I know.
I kept telling her.

273
00:17:02,135 --> 00:17:04,708
- What did she say?
- She didn't say anything.

274
00:17:05,365 --> 00:17:08,003
She just announced that she'd be
in the garage, working.

275
00:17:09,983 --> 00:17:10,983
Allison?!

276
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,460
I'm back here!

277
00:17:14,998 --> 00:17:16,423
What the hell is going on?

278
00:17:16,548 --> 00:17:17,748
I'm soldering.

279
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,242
And I'm getting
pretty good at it, too.

280
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:23,240
No, that's not what I mean, Allison.
People are on their way over.

281
00:17:23,365 --> 00:17:25,207
There's nothing cooking in the oven.

282
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:27,689
The dishwasher is in the middle
of the kitchen.

283
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:31,109
You're and the kids aren't dressed.
Come on, what the hell are you doing?!

284
00:17:31,234 --> 00:17:33,705
You know, I'm not quite sure,

285
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,304
but I was kind of hoping
that you could tell me.

286
00:17:36,673 --> 00:17:40,016
I think this thing really is
going to work, whatever it is.

287
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,477
You set the timer here and then
whenever that time runs out this thing

288
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,021
starts to get hot, really,
really hot,

289
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,612
but why and what that does,
I'm not...

290
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,575
What is that smell?

291
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,017
What are you talking about?
What smell?

292
00:17:53,142 --> 00:17:55,407
It almost smells
like a plumbing problem.

293
00:18:04,037 --> 00:18:05,709
Did you buy all this fertilizer?

294
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,295
I sure did. It took me
five trips to get it here.

295
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:12,173
Can you tell me why?

296
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,555
I'm not quite sure. I know it's got
something to do with this thing.

297
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,285
It wasn't something I planned to do.

298
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,100
It came into my head,
and I knew I had to have it.

299
00:18:28,703 --> 00:18:31,151
Allison, I need you to step away
from that thing right now.

300
00:18:31,766 --> 00:18:34,725
- All right, give me one second, honey.
- No, no, time's up.

301
00:18:35,684 --> 00:18:38,366
I need you to step away from
that thing and come with me.

302
00:18:38,949 --> 00:18:41,346
You know, if this is about
this whole dinner thing,

303
00:18:41,471 --> 00:18:44,471
I'm starting to think maybe
we should reschedule.

304
00:18:46,093 --> 00:18:48,190
- What are you doing?
- Put that down.

305
00:18:48,716 --> 00:18:51,803
Get the hell away from that thing.
Get away from it and go in the house.

306
00:18:51,928 --> 00:18:54,758
- What the hell is your problem?
- My problem? You want to know?

307
00:18:55,355 --> 00:18:59,179
This thing you've been working on, this
is some kind of a timer, a detonator.

308
00:19:00,562 --> 00:19:03,408
And these hundreds of pounds of
fertilizer you brought into our house,

309
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:06,231
our house where we live,
where our children live.

310
00:19:06,622 --> 00:19:08,104
These would be your explosives.

311
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:11,387
Now, I may be crazy,
but I think you're minutes away

312
00:19:11,512 --> 00:19:13,151
from having an uncontrollable urge

313
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,375
to rent a panel truck,
fill it with all this stuff

314
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,729
and drive it to a federal
building somewhere!

315
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:23,910
Oh, God.

316
00:19:24,893 --> 00:19:27,624
You know what. On second thought,
why don't you just continue doing

317
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,398
exactly what you're doing, okay?

318
00:19:29,523 --> 00:19:31,983
Because, you know, if we're all
dead then maybe no one will notice

319
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:33,758
that there's no dinner!

320
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:39,729
Sorry.

321
00:19:40,315 --> 00:19:43,014
David, hi.
Debbie. Hello, Joe.

322
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:46,244
God. This is so embarrassing...

323
00:19:48,002 --> 00:19:49,270
Is everything okay?

324
00:19:49,503 --> 00:19:50,840
Yes. No, no.

325
00:19:50,965 --> 00:19:51,965
It's, um...

326
00:19:53,017 --> 00:19:55,401
We've had a...
We've had a...

327
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,172
I'm so sorry.
It's my fault.

328
00:19:58,226 --> 00:20:00,185
Well, maybe "fault"
isn't the right word.

329
00:20:01,905 --> 00:20:04,035
It's me. I have food poisoning.

330
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:06,873
That's Debbie, that's David.

331
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,340
Yeah, I'm Allison.
It's nice to meet you.

332
00:20:09,689 --> 00:20:11,709
I... It's nice that I'm...
we just met.

333
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:14,936
No, please.
You don't have to do that.

334
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:17,318
I've been living in the bathroom
for the last...

335
00:20:17,622 --> 00:20:20,467
the last 45 minutes.
Which is you know, why...

336
00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:21,962
that's why I'm not dressed.

337
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:25,265
And, you know,
I've been in there cooking all day.

338
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:28,253
We would ask you in, but...

339
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:31,312
Yeah, it's like a bomb
went off in there.

340
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,025
Or we would ask you to go
to a restaurant, or something...

341
00:20:36,297 --> 00:20:38,197
Oh. I feel terrible for you.

342
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,735
Hey, I've been looking
all over for you guys.

343
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,285
This is our middle
daughter Bridgette.

344
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,195
- Say hi to the Brewers.
- Hi.

345
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,081
Do you guys know that it smells
like a barn out in the garage?

346
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:53,532
Hey, we're going to take off...

347
00:20:53,657 --> 00:20:54,860
but we brought this.

348
00:20:54,985 --> 00:20:58,256
- Oh, no, no. You don't have to do that.
- I... I insist.

349
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,630
I just... maybe
wouldn't drink it tonight.

350
00:21:14,036 --> 00:21:15,036
Right.

351
00:21:15,936 --> 00:21:18,067
All right, Dave.
So long. I'm sorry.

352
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:20,528
It's nice to meet you, Debbie.

353
00:21:23,806 --> 00:21:26,583
Okay, Bridgette, would you go
and get ready for bed?

354
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,658
Daddy needs to talk to Mommy.

355
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,833
What are you doing?

356
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:37,505
I called the store.
They're open till 10:00.

357
00:21:37,903 --> 00:21:40,338
So I'm loading up both cars.
We're taking all this back,

358
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:44,302
'cause I don't want it in the house.
I don't want it anywhere near the house.

359
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:48,734
Ariel can watch the girls.
You follow me in your car.

360
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,880
We'll get it done in a couple trips.

361
00:21:52,263 --> 00:21:54,563
- I can do this tomorrow.
- Yeah...

362
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:56,314
Right.

363
00:21:56,791 --> 00:22:00,209
- Well, what does that mean?
- That means that you built a bomb...

364
00:22:00,691 --> 00:22:01,903
in our house, Allison.

365
00:22:03,835 --> 00:22:05,518
In my children's house.

366
00:22:13,072 --> 00:22:15,583
Now get in the car, please.
It's getting late.

367
00:22:24,687 --> 00:22:26,187
Are you still awake?

368
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,096
You're kidding, right?

369
00:22:28,978 --> 00:22:30,378
I think it's over.

370
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:34,994
I took apart that thing that I was
building. I threw all the pieces away.

371
00:22:36,067 --> 00:22:37,967
Not even a twinge of regret.

372
00:22:38,796 --> 00:22:40,496
And for what it's worth,

373
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:43,109
when we went back to that store,

374
00:22:44,193 --> 00:22:46,196
nothing, nothing glowed.

375
00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:52,144
I'm sorry, but that's not
reassuring enough.

376
00:22:53,168 --> 00:22:54,918
I need you to promise me,

377
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,730
if these urges,
if these compulsions to...

378
00:22:58,452 --> 00:23:00,652
to build things to acquire things,

379
00:23:00,936 --> 00:23:03,313
if they come back,
you have to call me...

380
00:23:03,908 --> 00:23:05,466
you have to find me.

381
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:08,221
I'll come home.
I'll hold you down.

382
00:23:09,073 --> 00:23:11,097
I might call you just to test that.

383
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:16,674
I'm so sorry.

384
00:23:17,382 --> 00:23:19,232
I'm so sorry about tonight.

385
00:23:32,488 --> 00:23:35,126
So you got all this from
the Needles Police Department?

386
00:23:35,305 --> 00:23:38,676
The sheriff recognized the photo
of our John Doe as soon as he saw it.

387
00:23:39,304 --> 00:23:41,294
Turns out this guy
is actually Mitchell Slocumb.

388
00:23:41,993 --> 00:23:44,047
Mitchell Slocumb...
I know that name.

389
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:47,274
Well, I would hope so.
He certainly made enough news.

390
00:23:47,588 --> 00:23:50,427
Back in 1985,
he detonated a fertilizer bomb

391
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:54,074
in a parking garage beneath the federal
courthouse in Sacramento, California.

392
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,919
It was one of the first cases of
domestic terrorism in this country.

393
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:58,186
Seventeen people died.

394
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:02,405
Mitchell Slocumb wrote a letter
claiming credit for the bombing.

395
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,091
Then he just disappeared.

396
00:24:04,415 --> 00:24:05,865
That is, until now.

397
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,555
You okay?

398
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,100
Yeah, no, yeah.

399
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:12,137
I'm just...
I'm surprised.

400
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:15,997
Anyway, this man's death
is gonna be big news,

401
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,494
so before I talk to the media,
I just wanted to make sure you...

402
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:21,324
didn't have any new insights
into who might have killed him.

403
00:24:21,631 --> 00:24:24,374
Although, to be perfectly frank,
I'm not sure if I prefer to prosecute

404
00:24:24,499 --> 00:24:26,631
his murderer or recommend
the guy for a commendation.

405
00:24:28,646 --> 00:24:29,696
So nothing?

406
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:39,611
- You feeling better today?
- Yeah, thank you.

407
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,729
Can I have a word with you?

408
00:24:45,237 --> 00:24:48,862
I started building that bomb two days
ago, just hours after I saw his body.

409
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,532
I have to believe that's more
than just a coincidence.

410
00:24:53,447 --> 00:24:54,896
So you think maybe that

411
00:24:55,021 --> 00:24:58,329
he was using you to take care of
some unfinished business?

412
00:24:58,808 --> 00:25:00,678
He blew up a federal courthouse
in 1985.

413
00:25:00,803 --> 00:25:04,377
I work in a courthouse. I drive my car
into a courthouse garage every day.

414
00:25:08,392 --> 00:25:11,356
But you haven't called me, so I'm
assuming you haven't felt the need to

415
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:14,429
buy anything, build anything,
collect anything.

416
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:18,539
- What are you doing?
- If we can't be absolutely positive

417
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:21,517
that Mitchell Slocumb won't get
into your head again,

418
00:25:21,785 --> 00:25:23,812
at least we can make sure
you don't have the means

419
00:25:23,937 --> 00:25:25,880
to buy any more fertilizer for him.

420
00:25:27,147 --> 00:25:28,234
A gallon of gas?

421
00:25:35,406 --> 00:25:36,606
You all right?

422
00:25:39,528 --> 00:25:40,528
I'm fine.

423
00:25:42,254 --> 00:25:43,573
It's a bad habit.

424
00:25:44,636 --> 00:25:46,043
Debbie thinks I quit.

425
00:25:46,598 --> 00:25:48,448
If she knew, she'd kill me.

426
00:25:55,366 --> 00:25:56,916
You sure you're okay?

427
00:25:57,694 --> 00:25:58,844
No, I'm okay.

428
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:02,284
It's family stuff.
It's just...

429
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,759
It's family stuff.

430
00:26:25,598 --> 00:26:26,598
Explain.

431
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,300
Don't lie to me.
Don't lie to me!

432
00:26:31,914 --> 00:26:35,550
Don't tell me it wasn't you. You'll just
make it twice as bad if you lie to me.

433
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,376
I thought he deserved
a decent burial...

434
00:26:41,501 --> 00:26:44,352
I gave him what he deserved, Arlo.

435
00:26:46,894 --> 00:26:49,242
I tried so hard to raise you right.

436
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:50,496
Look at me!

437
00:26:52,045 --> 00:26:53,982
All you do is disappoint.

438
00:26:57,862 --> 00:26:59,662
The problem with you, son,

439
00:27:00,074 --> 00:27:02,245
is you keep forgetting
we're at war here.

440
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:05,377
Me... I got this to remind me.

441
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,860
I see it in the mirror every day
and I remember.

442
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:11,367
Crawling through the mud

443
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:13,859
and the puke at Khe Sanh.

444
00:27:14,914 --> 00:27:17,290
I remember my boots

445
00:27:17,614 --> 00:27:20,261
filling with the blood
of young American boys,

446
00:27:20,386 --> 00:27:22,333
whose daddies either
weren't rich or white enough

447
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,984
to keep them out of a racist,
classist draft.

448
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:29,889
I remember the stink
of their corpses...

449
00:27:31,975 --> 00:27:33,575
knowing that they died

450
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,346
for nothing.

451
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:46,805
- Dad, what are you doing?
- Like I said, Arlo,

452
00:27:47,387 --> 00:27:48,580
we're at war.

453
00:27:50,904 --> 00:27:53,379
Now you'll have something
to remind you.

454
00:27:54,017 --> 00:27:55,229
Dad... Dad!

455
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,828
It was nice seeing you again,
Allison.

456
00:28:10,953 --> 00:28:13,803
I hope the next time you meet Debbie,
you'll keep my secret.

457
00:28:28,827 --> 00:28:30,591
Somebody's been
awfully quiet all night.

458
00:28:30,716 --> 00:28:32,798
Well, somebody's in a real quandary.

459
00:28:33,459 --> 00:28:35,171
Oh, really? You think so?

460
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,174
Have you not heard
anything that I've said?

461
00:28:38,472 --> 00:28:40,383
Yeah, I got it.
He's a smoker.

462
00:28:41,285 --> 00:28:43,304
Me? I'm willing to look past it.

463
00:28:43,535 --> 00:28:46,019
You know that's not
what I'm talking about.

464
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:49,184
Seriously? Because I don't think
the other matters.

465
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:51,644
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

466
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,702
Let's say that you're right.
Let's say that...

467
00:28:53,827 --> 00:28:56,749
Mitchell Slocumb really is
David's father. So what?

468
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,389
Does that change who he is?

469
00:28:59,514 --> 00:29:02,482
Am I supposed to think less of him
for something that his father did?

470
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,382
Changing your name
so people won't hold

471
00:29:04,507 --> 00:29:06,661
what your father did against you,
is that a crime?

472
00:29:07,473 --> 00:29:10,373
- Boy, you really don't get it.
- No, Allison, I think I do.

473
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,178
As psychic dilemmas go,
this one's pretty cut-and-dry.

474
00:29:13,303 --> 00:29:15,781
If David Brewer doesn't want
anyone to know who he is,

475
00:29:15,906 --> 00:29:17,862
then that's fine,
that's his business.

476
00:29:17,987 --> 00:29:18,985
I get it.

477
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,133
We don't h he doesn't have to tell.

478
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:24,202
But, Joe, I think I have to ask.

479
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:28,766
I know that Slocumb was a monster, but
it's my job to find out who killed him.

480
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:32,775
- You think it might have been David?
- Well, I don't know.

481
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,446
But if what I'm seeing is true, in
addition to killing all of these people,

482
00:29:36,571 --> 00:29:39,318
Mitchell Slocumb was
an incredibly abusive parent.

483
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:41,708
That doesn't make David a killer.

484
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:44,185
And, look, let's not forget,
we're not absolutely certain

485
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,570
they're father and son.

486
00:29:45,695 --> 00:29:47,600
You should have seen him
outside of your office.

487
00:29:47,725 --> 00:29:50,513
It was right after the news hit
that we identified Slocumb.

488
00:29:51,227 --> 00:29:55,167
David was trembling. When I asked what's
wrong, he said it was a family thing.

489
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:58,331
Well, maybe it was. How do you know?
Maybe he had a fight with his wife.

490
00:29:58,456 --> 00:29:59,506
I am sorry.

491
00:29:59,859 --> 00:30:01,959
I know that you really like him.

492
00:30:02,114 --> 00:30:04,564
But I need to tell Devalos
what I know.

493
00:30:05,118 --> 00:30:07,012
And he's going to question him.

494
00:30:07,527 --> 00:30:10,400
Allison, we're not talking about
somebody that I... that I like here.

495
00:30:10,525 --> 00:30:13,453
We're talking about the only person
that I've hired so far.

496
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,428
He's like half the company.

497
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,738
- It took me three months to find him.
- I know.

498
00:30:24,995 --> 00:30:27,283
I want to be the one
to talk to him first.

499
00:30:27,642 --> 00:30:29,869
If he's going to get hauled into
the DA's office

500
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:31,905
because he has the bad luck
to work for me,

501
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,290
then I want to be the one
to explain it to him.

502
00:30:39,315 --> 00:30:42,825
- David, thank you so much for coming.
- Yeah. Like I have a choice.

503
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,132
I was born Arlo Slocumb.

504
00:30:52,836 --> 00:30:55,768
Mitchell Slocumb's my father.
Was my father.

505
00:30:57,626 --> 00:30:59,176
So what do you want to know?

506
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:03,574
I'm not going to be able to tell you
very much. I moved out before I was 17.

507
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:07,209
As soon as I turned 21,
I changed my name.

508
00:31:08,262 --> 00:31:10,159
I, I don't think
I have any light to shed.

509
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,152
Be that as it may, I do need
to ask you some questions,

510
00:31:13,277 --> 00:31:16,080
the most important being can you account
for your whereabouts Monday night?

511
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:19,093
You mean the night
that my father was killed?

512
00:31:20,698 --> 00:31:21,698
Yeah...

513
00:31:21,987 --> 00:31:23,337
but no. I mean...

514
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,217
I was at home, but there was
no one there with me.

515
00:31:27,357 --> 00:31:29,053
What about Debbie?
Your kids?

516
00:31:29,713 --> 00:31:31,931
They were visiting with
her sister in Flagstaff.

517
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:34,891
Is that the working theory?

518
00:31:35,016 --> 00:31:37,647
You think I spent 20 years
hiding that I was his son

519
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:41,565
so I could come back and kill him
and become notorious for it?

520
00:31:43,681 --> 00:31:45,068
I don't know how to prove it,

521
00:31:45,238 --> 00:31:46,977
but I didn't even know
he was in Phoenix

522
00:31:47,102 --> 00:31:49,525
until I saw the online report
that he was dead.

523
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,941
I'm afraid that's not good enough,
Mr. Brewer.

524
00:31:52,467 --> 00:31:54,745
I've got to find a way
to substantiate your alibi.

525
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,749
Even in death

526
00:31:58,106 --> 00:31:59,959
the man is complicating my life.

527
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,339
So what's next?
How do we do this?

528
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:08,031
It's pretty straightforward stuff.
We fingerprint you.

529
00:32:08,182 --> 00:32:10,366
Look around your house
for a murder weapon.

530
00:32:10,491 --> 00:32:13,179
- Talk to some people who know you.
- Oh, man.

531
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:16,476
Look.

532
00:32:16,782 --> 00:32:18,721
I get it.
I understand what you have to do.

533
00:32:18,846 --> 00:32:20,046
I get it. I...

534
00:32:20,323 --> 00:32:22,073
All I'm saying is just...

535
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,860
please be sensitive to my situation.

536
00:32:26,225 --> 00:32:27,325
Be discreet.

537
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:29,112
I've spent a long time

538
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:31,294
building a life as David Brewer.

539
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:33,293
I have a wife, I have two kids

540
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:36,412
who have no idea that their grandfather
was a mass murderer.

541
00:32:37,351 --> 00:32:39,962
I have a professional
reputation to protect.

542
00:32:40,253 --> 00:32:43,053
We understand, Mr. Brewer.
We'll do our best.

543
00:32:47,789 --> 00:32:50,766
Mom! Daddy's on the TV!
Daddy's on the TV!

544
00:32:51,043 --> 00:32:54,476
I was trying to find cartoons. But all
the channels had Daddy on them instead.

545
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,295
Mr. Slocumb, is it true you've been
living under an assumed name

546
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,809
- since the 1980s?
- I have nothing to say about that.

547
00:33:05,111 --> 00:33:07,373
- Seen the news?
- Seen it?

548
00:33:07,684 --> 00:33:09,627
Lee, my God, this is terrible.

549
00:33:09,926 --> 00:33:12,823
This man's a friend. He works for
my husband. We gave him our word.

550
00:33:13,263 --> 00:33:16,345
- <i>How did the press find out?</i>
- Someone must have seen my report,

551
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,786
made a call.
I'm guessing money changed hands.

552
00:33:19,342 --> 00:33:20,542
That poor man.

553
00:33:20,947 --> 00:33:23,697
All he did was ask us
to protect his privacy.

554
00:33:23,822 --> 00:33:25,252
<i>You ready for the punch line?</i>

555
00:33:25,743 --> 00:33:27,130
It was all for naught.

556
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,340
We found the man
who actually killed Slocumb.

557
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,799
Name is Donald Wright.

558
00:33:31,415 --> 00:33:34,348
<i>He ran with the same rightwing
nut jobs that Slocumb did.</i>

559
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:36,444
<i>Turns out the two of them
had a fight over money.</i>

560
00:33:36,569 --> 00:33:39,519
<i>Ended with Wright taking a pipe
to his "buddy's" skull.</i>

561
00:33:39,774 --> 00:33:43,312
David's completely innocent?
We questioned him for nothing.

562
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:46,502
I'm afraid so. I wonder
if it'll be any consolation to him

563
00:33:46,627 --> 00:33:49,026
while the media's picking
his life apart.

564
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:50,881
No, okay.

565
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,520
No, I, yeah, I understand.

566
00:33:56,148 --> 00:33:58,494
Look, if there's ever anything
that I can do for you...

567
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,171
I'm so sorry.
I really am, David.

568
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,459
What? What now?

569
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,630
He just quit.
They're moving.

570
00:34:10,372 --> 00:34:11,372
Oh, God, no.

571
00:34:12,061 --> 00:34:14,333
Somebody threw a rock
through their window.

572
00:34:14,777 --> 00:34:17,366
He's been getting threatening
phone calls all night.

573
00:34:18,784 --> 00:34:20,811
The police have a car parked
outside of his house,

574
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:23,015
but it's not like they can stay
there forever.

575
00:34:24,692 --> 00:34:26,592
He just wants out of here...

576
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,273
and I can't blame him.

577
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,668
I don't understand.
What is all this?

578
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:35,320
If he's innocent, why am I being shown
all these things?

579
00:34:35,906 --> 00:34:38,117
So I can ruin the life
of a good man?

580
00:34:39,003 --> 00:34:40,327
You got me, Al.

581
00:34:47,156 --> 00:34:48,156
Dad?

582
00:34:49,731 --> 00:34:51,338
I have something I want to show you.

583
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:01,070
What the hell is that?

584
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,768
I found one of those new microwave
ovens over at the dump.

585
00:35:05,531 --> 00:35:08,621
It was pretty smashed up,
but the inside still worked.

586
00:35:09,737 --> 00:35:11,108
It gave me an idea.

587
00:35:11,636 --> 00:35:13,186
See, this is a timer.

588
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:16,739
You just set it for however long
you need to get away.

589
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,657
And this, this thing
gets really, really hot.

590
00:35:21,295 --> 00:35:22,695
You take all this,

591
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:27,124
you put it in a vehicle filled
with gas and-and an oxidizer...

592
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:28,709
Oxidizer?

593
00:35:29,514 --> 00:35:30,964
What's an oxidizer?

594
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:32,459
Fertilizer.

595
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:35,770
You take 20 or 30 bags

596
00:35:35,895 --> 00:35:37,634
- of fertilizer...
- And what?

597
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:40,804
Well, I think you could
blow up a building.

598
00:35:54,046 --> 00:35:55,046
That's...

599
00:35:55,716 --> 00:35:57,156
beautiful, son.

600
00:35:59,403 --> 00:36:01,116
I could never build
something like that.

601
00:36:02,112 --> 00:36:03,327
Not in a million years.

602
00:36:04,715 --> 00:36:07,815
You always said you wanted
to change the world, Dad.

603
00:36:09,351 --> 00:36:10,334
Now you can.

604
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:42,098
Oh, my God, what are you up to now?

605
00:36:42,223 --> 00:36:44,651
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm not building anything.

606
00:36:44,776 --> 00:36:47,457
I'm not blowing anything up.
I'm just trying to find...

607
00:36:48,736 --> 00:36:49,786
Here it is.

608
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:52,993
From a 20-year-old microwave.
I completely missed the point.

609
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:56,421
I have no idea what you're
talking about. The point of what?

610
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,454
The dreams, the compulsions. They had
nothing to do with Mitchell Slocumb

611
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,912
trying to get me to blow up
another courthouse.

612
00:37:02,798 --> 00:37:05,383
It had to do with seeing
how the bomb really got made

613
00:37:05,508 --> 00:37:07,596
so I could understand
who really made it.

614
00:37:08,415 --> 00:37:10,416
What do you mean,
"who really made it"?

615
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:13,640
Mitchell Slocumb
didn't build that bomb, Joe.

616
00:37:15,074 --> 00:37:16,174
His son did.

617
00:37:17,853 --> 00:37:20,903
Remember that night he came over?
He handed me that bottle of wine?

618
00:37:21,321 --> 00:37:23,760
As soon as I touched it,
I saw these images.

619
00:37:23,885 --> 00:37:25,293
These flashes of...

620
00:37:25,418 --> 00:37:26,827
pictures. Faces.

621
00:37:27,687 --> 00:37:31,037
I really didn't understand it at the
time, but now I'm starting to think...

622
00:37:33,227 --> 00:37:34,477
There they are.

623
00:37:35,147 --> 00:37:36,597
There's 17 of them.

624
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:41,199
I'm starting to think that I saw them
'cause they're always in his head.

625
00:37:41,606 --> 00:37:43,156
He's haunted by them.

626
00:37:43,663 --> 00:37:45,616
Okay, so let's say
that you're right.

627
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:48,340
What are you gonna do?
It's 23 years now.

628
00:37:48,465 --> 00:37:50,623
The only other person
who was there is dead.

629
00:37:51,127 --> 00:37:53,721
How exactly do you go
about proving any of this?

630
00:37:54,055 --> 00:37:55,801
I mean, what do you do with it?

631
00:37:58,776 --> 00:37:59,926
I don't know.

632
00:38:11,848 --> 00:38:13,039
How do you do it?

633
00:38:14,704 --> 00:38:16,562
How do you live with yourself?

634
00:38:17,406 --> 00:38:19,515
How do you live with it
day in and day out?

635
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:22,382
With 17 people's lives
on your conscience?

636
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,744
I don't know what you're talking about.
They aren't on my conscience.

637
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:29,723
My father detonated that bomb.
My father killed those people.

638
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:32,257
Your father figured out how to use

639
00:38:32,382 --> 00:38:34,558
microwave oven parts
to build a detonator?

640
00:38:34,683 --> 00:38:36,275
You father knew to use

641
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,745
gasoline and fertilizer ten years

642
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:41,390
before Timothy McVeigh
and the Oklahoma City bombing?

643
00:38:41,948 --> 00:38:45,280
Your father, who dropped out of high
school and went right into the army?

644
00:38:47,382 --> 00:38:48,908
I think I'd like you to leave now.

645
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,527
I know you built it.

646
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,434
I know you made it.

647
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:54,085
I know you gave it to your father.

648
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,913
And he drove it to California
and he murdered

649
00:38:57,038 --> 00:38:58,377
17 people.

650
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,921
17 people whose pictures you saw

651
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,956
in the newspaper the next morning.

652
00:39:04,081 --> 00:39:07,208
17 people whose faces
are etched in your mind.

653
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,360
Whatever you say.

654
00:39:10,334 --> 00:39:13,515
But seeing as how there are no police
cars flooding this driveway,

655
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,144
I don't see how you are actually
able to prove that.

656
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:18,563
Well, you're right.
I can't prove it.

657
00:39:19,243 --> 00:39:21,401
But the 17 people
who died that day...

658
00:39:22,154 --> 00:39:24,187
the people who loved them...

659
00:39:25,165 --> 00:39:27,239
they really deserve to know
what really happened.

660
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,206
They-they know what happened.

661
00:39:29,571 --> 00:39:31,903
A misguided fool with mental
problems set off a bomb.

662
00:39:32,028 --> 00:39:34,580
And if it hadn't been that bomb,
it might have been another.

663
00:39:35,178 --> 00:39:37,503
Dynamite stolen
from a construction site,

664
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:39,543
or a war-surplus hand grenade.

665
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,790
Is that how you excuse what you did?

666
00:39:47,442 --> 00:39:49,678
By the way,
I think your math's a little off.

667
00:39:51,868 --> 00:39:53,549
18 people died that day.

668
00:39:56,231 --> 00:39:57,659
A badly damaged

669
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,848
boy named Arlo Slocumb...

670
00:39:59,973 --> 00:40:01,823
he died in that blast, too.

671
00:40:04,434 --> 00:40:06,084
And out of his ashes...

672
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:08,572
David Brewer was born.

673
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,355
And while David Brewer
may sometimes think about

674
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,030
some of the things
that Arlo Slocumb did,

675
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:19,317
it'd be an unspeakable tragedy
for him to go to jail

676
00:40:19,442 --> 00:40:21,136
for that boy's crimes.

677
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:24,255
I mean...

678
00:40:24,703 --> 00:40:27,549
what would be the point of
destroying one more family?

679
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:32,888
- Sweetie. We really need to get going.
- I'll be right there.

680
00:40:39,755 --> 00:40:43,365
I'm sorry that we're not gonna able
to have that dinner, Allison.

681
00:40:44,764 --> 00:40:46,714
I really think you'd like me.

682
00:41:00,817 --> 00:41:02,217
It's always there,

683
00:41:03,114 --> 00:41:04,294
isn't it?

684
00:41:08,142 --> 00:41:09,492
Give Joe my best.
