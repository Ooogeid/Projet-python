4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,910
<i>"A closer look.</i>

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,570

00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,730

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,070
<i>"Those pictures of you in the
paper don't do you justice.</i>

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,659

<i>"to get this close,</i>

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,050

<i>"Because this time,</i>

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,310
<i>"I know you felt me, too.</i>

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,200
<i>"Of course you would
have to be this pretty,</i>

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,819
<i>"because what you do, the-the
things you see are so ugly,</i>

16
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,540
<i>"are so unnatural.</i>

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,189
<i>"Oh, the devil is
always the prettiest girl</i>

18
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,890
<i>"or the best-dressed man at the party.</i>

19
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,270
<i>"There is a natural order to things.</i>

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,009
<i>"It is God's pattern,</i>

21
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,099
<i>"and you break that pattern</i>

22
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,039
<i>"when you offer your supposed wisdom</i>

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,970
<i>"which you derive from things

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,419
<i>"I read about you,</i>

25
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,669
<i>"and wonder: do you even understand</i>

26
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,810
<i>"what a disruption you
are to the natural order?</i>

27
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,860
<i>"Do you even know</i>

28
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,400
<i>"that you're an instrument of evil?</i>

29
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,949
<i>"Or does the devil exploit
your stupidity and somehow</i>

30
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,270
<i>"convince you that you are
on the side of the angels,</i>

46
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,260
Should we keep this one?

47
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,580
Nope. Recycle.

48
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,240
Keep?

49
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,549
Yes, we definitely have to keep this.

50
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,169
This is the electric bill.

51
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,779
Something's wrong here.

52
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,020
What's the matter, Bridge?

53
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,980
Where the heck are the
comics in this paper?

54
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,739
I've flipped through it
twice, but they're not in here.

55
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,940
I mean, I think someone left them out.

56
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,349
No one left them out.

57
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,449
There's no comics in that paper.

58
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,380
That's not that kind of paper.

59
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,819
What are you talking about?

60
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,359
Every paper has to have a comic.

61
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,750
I mean, why else would anyone read it?

62
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,530
Ariel's right, Bridge.

63
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,829
That's a financial paper.

64
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,369
It doesn't have any comics in it.

65
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,250
Nothing to make you laugh,
nothing to make you smile.

66
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,260
Nothing but bad news about
stocks and 401K plans.

67
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,769
What's a
four-oh-one K plan?

68
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,630
About half what it used
to be. Hey, look at this.

69
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,690
Your daughter's cutting
stuff out of the paper again.

70
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,139
<i>Oh, sweetie, you have to use the
old newspapers for your paper dolls.</i>

71
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,470
Sorry, Mommy.

72
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,800
It's okay.

73
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,130
Keep?

74
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,220
Uh, yes, honey.

75
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,110
Mommy needs to keep this one.

76
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,275
"The thought of hurting you
fills me with profound sorrow.

77
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,890
"You have to be stopped.

78
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:23,190
Please stop, or I will stop you!"

79
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,340
Underline, exclamation
point, exclamation point.

80
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,160
Conveniently unsigned.

81
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,849
Quite the fan of excessive punctuation.

82
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,300
It came in the mail
this morning to my house.

83
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,210
How concerned should I be?

84
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:47,150
This is about five
years worth, and, uh...

85
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,840
...this is one of my favorites.

86
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,399
"Whore of Satan, don't run too far,

87
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,070
or I will bleed you,
like the pig you are"?

88
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,070
Great. It even rhymes.

89
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,330
I get about one of these a month.

90
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,759
They come from the relatives
of men that I sent to prison.

91
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,929
I get them from people who dislike
having a Latino district attorney.

92
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,059
And-And from some people,

93
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,239
I get them because they
hate, just for hats sake.

94
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,810
But at the end of the day, they
all have one thing in common.

95
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,310
What's that?

96
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,740
None of the threats
ever amounts to anything.

97
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,540
Wait. So, you just put them
in that drawer and do nothing?

98
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,580
Actually... yes.

99
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,030
Sorry I'm late, Terry.

100
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,350
Oh, I called you on the spur
of the moment. I understand.

101
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,150
Don't do that.

102
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,470
You're here to listen, not eat.

103
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,190
You read the papers?

104
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,690
The financial press?

105
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,549
Uh... Uh, it's funny
you should mention that.

106
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,890
No. There's nothing funny about it.

107
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,990
You R & D guys. Your heads
are always in the future.

108
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,569
Problem is, business is
done in the here and now.

109
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,580
It's about things you can
see, hold in your hand.

110
00:05:58,615 --> 00:05:59,773
Things you can sell today.

111
00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:01,539
Not things in your head,
things in your imagination.

112
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,860
Things that don't exist yet.

113
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,999
Anyway, if you read the papers,

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,100
you know that the here and
now is pretty damn bleak.

115
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,090
And that includes the here and
now at Cavanaugh Industries.

116
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,100
How bleak is bleak?

117
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,650
Bleak enough for me to ask you to take
a hard look at your operation, Joe.

118
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,439
Are we talking, uh,
resources or-or people?

119
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,640
I'm telling you to
cut whatever's cutable.

120
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,560
Look, Joe, without a fairly
substantial cash infusion,

121
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,089
Cavanaugh Industries is going to
have to become a much leaner place.

122
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,140
We're going to have
to do 100% of the work

123
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,910
with only half of the
money and manpower.

124
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,890
The key phrase being,

125
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,140
"without a cash infusion. "

126
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,049
And that's why I've asked
you to meet me today.

127
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,130
I... need a favor.

128
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,499
I'm contemplating a stock purchase.

129
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,879
<i>A rather large</i>

130
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,490
stock purchase.

131
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,829
You've heard of Richter-Mullis?

132
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,140
Yeah, that's a defense
contractor, right?

133
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,819
Rumor is, they're about to be awarded
a couple of huge government contracts.

134
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,380
I got people telling
me it's a sure thing.

135
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,540
I also got people telling me not
to go near it with a ten-foot pole.

136
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,939
It's more of a gamble
than I'm accustomed to.

137
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,450
I need some advice on which way to jump.

138
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,879
Wow, Terry. Uh... Markets and finances-

139
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,689
that's really not something
that I know a lot about.

140
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,480
<i>From your wife, Joe.</i>

141
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,979
We don't have a name.

142
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,660
Looks to be about 17.

143
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,749
Found in an abandoned apartment
building in Paradise Plains.

144
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,749
The building owner figured
her for a junkie who broke in,

145
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,700
got high, then fell down the stairs.

146
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,779
Apparently, it's happened before.

147
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,729
I take it the coroner doesn't agree.

148
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,959
No. There's no needle marks.

149
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,570
And the bruising to her face, the trauma to the skull
- none of that's consistent with a fall.

150
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,730
He feels pretty strongly that
this girl was beaten to death.

151
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,599
Do we have a clue as to who
this girl might be? No, not yet.

152
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,080
No reports of a missing girl
matching her description.

153
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,670
No matches on her prints or DNA...

154
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,850
What would you say if I told you
that-that I think she was gassed?

155
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,780
I think someone subdued her

156
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,470
using some kind of mask
attached to a canister.

157
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,219
Is there any way that...
that you could test that?

158
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,940
Is-Is it possible that she could
still have some gas left in her lungs?

159
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,960
Ariel, it's mommy. I'm heading
home. Is Daddy home yet?

160
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,459
Well, I don't know what to say.
I can't make dinner till I'm home,

161
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,110
and I'm not home yet, so...

162
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,710
Well, listen, why don't
you guys order a pizza?

163
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,880
there's a coupon stuck on the
front door of refrigerator.

164
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,489
and then just go into
Daddy's sock drawer.

165
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,039
On the left-hand side, you can find an
envelope with a bunch of money in it.

166
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,679
But don't bother
memorizing the hiding place,

167
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,240
'cause we're gonna change it tonight.

168
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,190
WHAT THE HELL?

169
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,599
Honey, I've got to go.

170
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,629
I'm gonna have to pull over the car.

171
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,719
I'm having some kind of car trouble,

172
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,310
so I got to call the motor club.

173
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,830
Okay. SEE YOU SOON.

174
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,890
Motor club. Motor club.

175
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,799
Wow. That was lucky.

176
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,109
I hadn't even finished
dialing the motor club.

177
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,389
I was headed back from a job

178
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,060
when I saw your smoke signal there.

179
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,939
I can tow you to the
nearest station, if you like.

180
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,209
You can call it in while
I hook you up to the rig.

181
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,080
That would be great. Thanks.

182
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,100
Your call is important
to us. Please hold.

183
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,299
- Your call is important to us...
- All set.

184
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,650
- Please hold.
- Still on hold?

185
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,500
I'll just radio it in while we're
on the way to the gas station.

186
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,080
Here. Get on in.

187
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,359
Uh... no, no, no, no.

188
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,150
I think I'd rath... I'd rather not.

189
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,530
Is something the matter, ma'am?

190
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,189
Uh, no. No, no, no.

191
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,139
I just, uh... I just changed my mind.

192
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,239
Um, I-I think I'm just going to wait
here till my... my husband gets here.

193
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,240
If you wouldn't mind just, uh...

194
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,010
just unhooking my car?

195
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,269
Actually, that makes almost no sense.

196
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,560
The, uh... Well, the
hard part is already done.

197
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,860
Why don't you hop in,

198
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,019
let me drive you to
the nearest gas station?

199
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,250
You can call your husband
and have him meet you there.

200
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,219
Come on now, Miss.
The faster you get in,

201
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,469
the faster you can get your car fixed,

202
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,350
the faster you get back to your family.

203
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,790
My family?

204
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,789
<i>How do... How do you
even know I have a family?</i>

205
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:23,352
You already talked about your husband,

206
00:11:23,387 --> 00:11:26,069
and I can see your child's car
seat in the back of your car.

207
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,359
Just-Just unhook my car.

208
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,570
I'll do whatever you want,

209
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,560
but it's a short drive to the station.

210
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,879
The motor club'll cover it, if
that's what you're worried about.

211
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,660
Unhook my car, or I'm going to scream.

212
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,889
- Miss, please.
- Hey! Hey!

213
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,280
Unhook my car. Unhook my car!

214
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,700
- HELP
- You all right?

215
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,240
Everything all right?

216
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,689
Yeah, we're just fine.

217
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,869
Lady wants me to unhook her car,

218
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,404
and that's what I'm about to do.

219
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:50,484
Is that all right?

220
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,529
Lady, are you okay?

221
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,313
Yeah, please just stay
here with me, please.

222
00:11:53,348 --> 00:11:55,119
- Please.
- Okay.

223
00:11:55,154 --> 00:11:56,890
READY SET GO! TOWING.

224
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,829
Look, if this tow truck
driver is in fact the man

225
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,469
who wrote you those threatening letters,

226
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,839
we're certainly not gonna have
a difficult time finding him.

227
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,379
Scanlon's on his way over to
the towing company right now.

228
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,829
But I'd be less than honest if I didn't
tell you that I'm a bit skeptical.

229
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,719
I mean, it does not
make a whole lot of sense

230
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,019
for someone who means to do you harm to

231
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,309
come after you in a vehicle emblazoned
with his name and phone number.

232
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,679
You don't understand.

233
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,159
I saw this man's hand.

234
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,809
He had the exact same tattoo
as the man from my dream.

235
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,789
I even saw red ink on his fingers.

236
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,179
Again, a lot of people have red pens.

237
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,909
And the tattoo you're describing
- well, it...

238
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,229
It might be uncommon,
but it's hardly unique.

239
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,319
What you're saying makes sense,

240
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,499
and I'd love to jump on the bandwagon

241
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,269
and tell my wife that she's
got nothing to worry about,

242
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,619
but I just got off the phone

243
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,942
with the service station
where we dropped the car off.

244
00:12:52,977 --> 00:12:53,865
The mechanic there

245
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,030
said it's the water pump
drive belt that's broken.

246
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,910
Actually, he said it
wasn't broken at all.

247
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,670
It wasn't even worn out.

248
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,680
He said it had... it had been cut.

249
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,219
That man knew where I was
parking in the municipal garage.

250
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,249
He cut that belt.

251
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,720
Then he followed me
till my car overheated.

252
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,749
Excuse me.

253
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,990
We have to do something.

254
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,640
Yeah, Lee.

255
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,750
So, here's the thing.

256
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,789
I contacted Ready Set Go Towing.

257
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,379
The driver of the truck's
a guy named Lucas Harvey.

258
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,160
I'm at his place right now.

259
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,119
So what does he have to say for himself?

260
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,520
Not much. He's not here.

261
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,170
But I think you're going to
want to get a look at this place.

262
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,549
Okay. I'm at Allison's.

263
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,438
Uh, give me an address,
we'll head right over.

264
00:13:36,473 --> 00:13:37,825
I wouldn't do that.

265
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,349
It should really just be you alone.

266
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,320
You sure?

267
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,240
Oh, yeah, I'm positive.

268
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,989
Good God Almighty.

269
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,590
Toothbrush is gone,
dresser drawers are empty.

270
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,490
We just put an APB out on him.

271
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,519
This is... stunning.

272
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,560
CAN PHOENIX TRUST ALLISON DUBOIS?

273
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,250
Well, it gets worse.

274
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,090
He's got a little magazine
rack in the bathroom.

275
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,300
This was in there
along with all the porn.

276
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,589
He's got it all here.

277
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,269
When school starts,
when school gets out.

278
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,500
Clubs they go to, friends' houses.

279
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,050
Pretty complete dossier
on each of the girls.

280
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,370
Okay.

281
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,150
I need to get back to the Dubois
house, talk them through this.

282
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,630
Get some men to follow me over.

283
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,740
I want a detail on that house 24
hours a day until we find this lunatic.

284
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,740
Yeah.

285
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,639
I wouldn't rush to get
dressed for school today.

286
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,450
I think there's something going on.

287
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,529
Hello?

288
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,349
Joe? Is that you?

289
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,070
Terry, hi.

290
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,219
Uh, Terry, hold on one second.

291
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,030
Let me get someplace, uh,

292
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,910
private and quiet where we can talk.

293
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,000
God, you're harder to find
than a whore in church.

294
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,279
Called your office, called your cell...

295
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,749
Sorry, sorry, uh, it's...

296
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,810
it's been crazy around here today.

297
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,940
So, what's the verdict
on Richter-Mullis?

298
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,209
Uh, excuse me?

299
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,200
What did your wife say about the stock?

300
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,170
Joe? Did I lose you?

301
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,269
No, I'm here. Um, Terry...

302
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,280
I
- I haven't had a chance to ask her about it yet.

303
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,750
Like I say, it's been, um,

304
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,320
it's been a crazy day around here.

305
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,550
When do you think this
is going to happen?

306
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,879
Tonight.

307
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,760
Um, I'll make sure it happens tonight.

308
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,060
Just stopped by to see how my
favorite shut-ins are doing.

309
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,330
So, basically you have no news?

310
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:08,440
No, not yet.

311
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,189
Look, the guy's gotta eat.
He's gotta get a room somewhere,

312
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,950
he's got to make a cell phone call

313
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,959
and soon as he does, soon
as he flips that thing on,

314
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,420
soon as he pulls out a credit
card this whole thing is over.

315
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,319
How do we know that he
isn't camping out somewhere?

316
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,239
How do we know he hasn't brought
a whole bunch of food with him?

317
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,550
How do we know he hasn't got one of
those, like, disposable cell phones?

318
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,930
We don't.

319
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,309
I don't know, the girls
have to go to school.

320
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,259
I
- I have to go to work.

321
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,249
Joe, come on. We've all
known each other for a while.

322
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,600
You gotta believe me when I tell you we're
doing everything we can to reel this guy in.

323
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,509
I know the confinement's hard.

324
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,829
I know having officers
standing out front's not fun.

325
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:49,110
But honestly, all we're trying
to do here is keep everybody safe.

326
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,840
Excuse me, I'm gonna
go check on the girls.

327
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,369
I think he's under a lot
of pressure from work.

328
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,820
Yeah, I know.

329
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,690
I get it, I really do.

330
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,989
You mind if I change the subject?

331
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,480
No, I wish you would.

332
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,879
The Medical Examiner ran some tests

333
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,269
on that 17-year- old Jane Doe from
the abandoned apartment complex.

334
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,910
Turns out she had a chemical
in her system called Isoflurane.

335
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,100
I'm sorry, I don't know what thats.

336
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,390
It's a knock-out gas normally
used to prep patients for surgery.

337
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,799
Which means whoever did this to her is

338
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,620
either licensed to use this
stuff or knows someone who is.

339
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,190
A doctor, anesthesiologist, maybe.

340
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,839
Tell Joe, uh...

341
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,160
No, no, no, don't worry.

342
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,820
Let me take care of Joe.

343
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,030
Thanks.

344
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,770
Oh, hey, Hannah wants to know
if I'm going to school tomorrow.

345
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,159
Hannah wants to know if I'm going...

346
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,920
I don't know yet, honey, I...

347
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,719
Well, then, uh, she wants to know
then if it would be all right if, uh,

348
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,300
she drove by the house in the morning on
her way to school to see the police outside?

349
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,410
You know what?

350
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,530
I'll just tell her no.

351
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,740
Okay.

352
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,859
Honey, I'm gonna leave
the door open, okay?

353
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,690
Sweet dreams. Just call us
if you need anything, okay?

354
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,870
Okay, love you.

355
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,049
Okay, I went absolutely nowhere today.

356
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,489
I did absolutely nothing

357
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,120
and yet I've never been
so tired in my entire life.

358
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,380
I need to ask you a favor.

359
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,970
Okay, I got this off the Internet.

360
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,290
And this is an article about them

361
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,250
that I found in the, um,

362
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,780
in the financial journal
that I just started getting.

363
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,500
Here, here you go.

364
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,790
Okay.

365
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,319
Okay, let's see.

366
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,390
"A small company with big hopes... "

367
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,759
And then I can't read it because
there's a doll-shaped hole cut in it.

368
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,579
Yeah. Right, I know that but you know,

369
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,530
you can still kind
of get the gist of it.

370
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:29,950
All right, I'm reading.
Now, I'm reading...

371
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,120
Now I know everything that
anyone who read this knows.

372
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,720
Maybe less, 'cause I don't
really understand this stuff.

373
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,769
What's... What is the point?

374
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,110
Well, the point is,
he wants your opinion.

375
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,709
Isn't he the man who
mocked me a month ago?

376
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,620
Yes, but he's also the
man that pays me each week.

377
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,010
Okay.

378
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,779
You know what, honey?
This is ridiculous.

379
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,979
It doesn't work this way.

380
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,409
I don't work this way, you know that.

381
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,270
No, I don't know how it works.

382
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,410
I don't know what you're
going to dream about tonight.

383
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,929
Neither do you.

384
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,180
Who knows, maybe if you,

385
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,220
if you look at this stuff it'll...

386
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,429
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

387
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,589
You know I can barely
balance our checkbook.

388
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,970
Believe me, I know.

389
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,530
Promise you, my hopes are down.

390
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,150
Hey...

391
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,260
You okay?

392
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,550
You want me to call somebody?

393
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,850
Sir, do you think some water would help?

394
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,255
- Morning.
- Morning.

395
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,309
Heard you were running
low on some groceries,

396
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,699
so, I thought I'd bring
over a couple of things,

397
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,019
milk, coffee, doughnuts.

398
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,679
Kind of a policeman's breakfast.

399
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,110
Cool!

400
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,199
I'm starting to think that
maybe I want to be a policeman.

401
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,870
Policewoman.

402
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,330
There's also a couple things
I'd love to fill you in on.

403
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,910
News of this Lucas Harvey guy?

404
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,190
I'm sorry, no.

405
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,970
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

406
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,319
You both should know, we, uh,

407
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,969
we've had an all-points bulletin out
on this fellow for almost 36 hours now.

408
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:43,959
He is going to be found.

409
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,289
From your lips.

410
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:49,039
Oh, and by the way, there are people
working on bringing you over real groceries.

411
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,129
They should, uh, make
a delive later on today.

412
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,529
More doughnuts?

413
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,269
No, sweetie, we got plenty of doughnuts.

414
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,699
Hey, girls, why don't you, um,
offer these gentlemen a doughnut?

415
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,660
Sure thing.

416
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,610
This is her; this is
the woman I dreamt about.

417
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,870
Interesting.

418
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,220
You're dreaming a bit outside
our jurisdiction, Allison.

419
00:22:05,255 --> 00:22:07,680
This woman was murdered
last night in Scottsdale.

420
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,670
Their coroner sent these over.

421
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,690
Her name is Cassidy Pearson.

422
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,699
Her body was found not
an hour and a half ago

423
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,650
underneath the bleachers
at the local high school.

424
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,220
And did the coroner test
her for traces of that gas?

425
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,360
Isoflurane?

426
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,679
Same chemical used on our Jane Doe.

427
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,890
You got a phone call.

428
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,710
It's Lucas Harvey.

429
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,159
Keep him on the line as long as
you can so we can get a trace.

430
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,610
Wait. Wait...

431
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,579
Hello? This is Allison.
This is Allison Dubois.

432
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,789
And this is Lucas Harvey.

433
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,900
The man of your dreams.

434
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,960
You have dreamt about me, haven't you?

435
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,079
That's how you knew it was me

436
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,069
the other night by the
side of the road, right?

437
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,439
What do you want?

438
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,289
"For now I will stretch out
my hand, that I may smite thee

439
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,139
"and thy people with pestilence;

440
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,450
and thou shalt be cut
off from the earth. "

441
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,969
Is that it? Is that what
you're calling to tell me?

442
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,829
I've been looking for
you to show up at work.

443
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:19,099
Looking for your little
girls to show up at school.

444
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,829
Yeah, well, I know a lot of people
who have been looking for you, too.

445
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,169
I take no pleasure in this, Mrs. Dubois.

446
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,750
I take no pleasure in hunting
down a mother and her babies.

447
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:34,959
But God has a plan and there's
no room in it for prophets.

448
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,925
For seers.

449
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,469
You toy with destiny.

450
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,829
You mock the Almighty
with your dreaming,

451
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,769
with your second sight.

452
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,949
Well, I'd like to believe
it's God who gave it to me.

453
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:50,310
I'd like to believe it's the
Almighty that gave this to me.

454
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,869
You can believe whatever you like.

455
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,490
But you're wrong.

456
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,530
Not that it matters.

457
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,899
I have every confidence
that you and the Almighty

458
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,159
will be discussing it face to
face in a matter of hours anyway.

459
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,810
Really, now, who's the prophet now?

460
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,830
Hello, hello?

461
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,990
He was calling from a cell
phone at the Arizona Center.

462
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,309
We're still triangulating him,

463
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,460
so, I'm assuming he's
still making phone calls.

464
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:23,410
Well, get as many units there
as you can as quickly as you can.

465
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,690
I'm going to hand you over to someone
who can lead you right to him, hang on.

466
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,629
I think maybe we finally caught a break.

467
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,630
Thank you.

468
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,169
Okay, ready.

469
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,060
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

470
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,930
- War!
- War!

471
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,920
Go away, we're warring!

472
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,100
Uh, Dad?

473
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,849
The, uh, police guy who's
monitoring the phone says

474
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,329
that your boss keeps calling

475
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:49,930
and they're trying to keep the phone lines
clear in case the crazy guy calls again.

476
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:53,029
So, he wanted to know, uh, do you mind
if they keep giving him the busy signal

477
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:56,300
and he suggested that maybe you want
to call him directly from your cell?

478
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,450
No, that's all right,
I'll call him later.

479
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,270
One, two, three!

480
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,370
You lose!

481
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,579
They found the cell phone
that the call was made from.

482
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,880
It was sitting on top of a Bible

483
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,610
in the food court at the Arizona Center.

484
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,110
But Lucas Harvey himself was long gone.

485
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,050
That'll be your groceries.

486
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,959
Are we expecting someone?

487
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,140
It's groceries.

488
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,669
Couldn't figure out if you were
a paper or plastic kinda girl.

489
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,310
Hope you don't mind, I went old school.

490
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,489
Oh, Bridge, honey, can you show
these men where the kitchen is?

491
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,659
And you and Ariel can
start putting things away?

492
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,469
All right, that's what I call service.

493
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,100
I wouldn't be too excited.

494
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,090
Lucas Harvey's gone missing again.

495
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,289
What?

496
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,619
Found his cell phone but not him.

497
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,449
We just have to hope that he calls again

498
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,130
and we can pin him down sooner.

499
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,320
Oh, my God.

500
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,749
What if he doesn't?

501
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,329
This guy is all about
getting to Allison.

502
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,920
There's no way he's
just gonna disappear.

503
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,059
He'll make a move.

504
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,019
He'll call, he'll show up.

505
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,520
We just have to be ready when he does.

506
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,130
Does everybody hear that?

507
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,689
What's that? Water running.

508
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,600
I think Marie's playing
with the bath again.

509
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,850
Okay, four guys, five bucks each.

510
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,490
Make sure I get a receipt,
will ya? Thanks a lot.

511
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,319
I thought there were five guys.

512
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,540
There's four.

513
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,950
Honey?

514
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,020
It's holy water.

515
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,030
To cleanse you with.

516
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,270
You okay?!

517
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,640
You hurt?!

518
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,110
I feel so guilty.

519
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,360
I brought him here... Me.

520
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,209
Into our home. I exposed
our whole family to him.

521
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,850
You didn't bring him anywhere.

522
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,870
He was crazy.

523
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,329
Now he's dead.

524
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,590
Still...

525
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,969
Still what?

526
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,470
You did not bring hihere.

527
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,330
For what it's worth, the girls
didn't actually see anything.

528
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,920
And the person who did bring
him here- Detective Scanlon-

529
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,189
trust me, based on the look
on his face when he left,

530
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,500
he's feeling guilty enough for everyone.

531
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,080
What if I just stopped?

532
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,830
Stopped what?

533
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,819
Stopped dreaming.

534
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,420
Stopped seeing things.

535
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,500
I didn't know you could do that.

536
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,170
No, you know what I mean.

537
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,420
What if I just stopped paying attention?

538
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,500
Stopped telling anyone.

539
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,090
What if I just pretended
it wasn't happening?

540
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,190
I didn't know that you
could do that either.

541
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,150
Come on, let's just get some sleep.

542
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,450
It's night; we're safe.

543
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,780
Lucas Harvey's dead.

544
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,470
The boogey-man has
boogied on out of here.

545
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,160
Let's get some sleep, okay?

546
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,249
With the close of the
bell on Wall Street today,

547
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,259
last night's Presidential
address about Washington's plans

548
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,369
to fix the troubled economy
seemed to calm the markets.

549
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,960
There were even a few big winners.

550
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,429
Riter-Mullis's stock shot up sharply on news
they had won several large government contracts.

551
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:30,930
The time is currently 6:10 p.
m. and here's Calleigh Newsome...

552
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,850
Excuse me?

553
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,530
Uh, sorry to bother you.

554
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,579
You have the time?

555
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,870
No, sorry, not wearing a watch.

556
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,549
2-
T- H.

557
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,300
D-
O- C-1.

558
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,580
2-
T- H-D-O-C-1.

559
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,760
2-
T- H-D-O-C-1.

560
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:19,150
2- T-H-D-O-C-1,
2- T-H-D-O-C-1.

561
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,040
2-
T- H-D-O-C-1.

562
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,240
2-
T- H...

563
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,890
D-
O- C-1.

564
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,480
Hey, what are you doing?

565
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,449
It's a little after 6:00.

566
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,330
We don't have to get up
for another 45 minutes.

567
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,690
But I had a dream.

568
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,050
You are amazing.

569
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:45,679
Last night you swore off everything
psychic and then this morning

570
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,239
you can't get out here fast
enough to write down your dreams.

571
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,280
Hey, you think the paper's here yet?

572
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:52,820
Why? Can you grab it for me?

573
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,270
Tooth-Doc1...

574
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,919
Hey! I think this guy's a dentist!

575
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,739
The one who keeps gassing these girls!

576
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,860
What, you dreamt about him
giving someone a root canal?

577
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,729
No, look at his license plate number.

578
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,440
2-
T- H-D-O-C-1.

579
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,540
Tooth-Doc1. That's terrific.

580
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:16,110
Can we go back to sleep now?

581
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,110
Hey, the President give
a speech last night?

582
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,070
"President Addresses Economy
in White House Speech. "

583
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,559
You want me to read it to you?

584
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,020
No, no, just that he said it.

585
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,879
Because if he said it last night

586
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,989
that means that my dentist

587
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,979
hasn't killed the girl
I've been dreaming about.

588
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,960
Not yet.

589
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,580
Not until just before sundown today.

590
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,550
Oh, that's it?

591
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,860
Oh, no, actually,

592
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,109
you gotta tell your
boss to buy that stock.

593
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,870
It's gonna go up today, way up.

594
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,610
Wait, you dreamt that, too?
This is in the same dream?

595
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,980
Yeah, actually... actually, it was.

596
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,740
Tooth-Doc1, huh?

597
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,960
That'd explain how he
had access to Isoflurane.

598
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,780
That's him! Jeremy Crane.

599
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,430
There's his current address.

600
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,120
You know what? I'm gonna
head over there now.

601
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,469
With any luck he's still home.

602
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,220
We can grab him before
he leaves for work.

603
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,599
Hey, remember, if he's not there

604
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,329
he's gonna abduct that girl tonight

605
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,469
from Benedict Park at sundown.

606
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,489
Don't worry, I'll send a couple
squad cars over there now.

607
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,880
North and South entrance,
we'll stake it out all day.

608
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,240
No, I'm holding for...
for Terry Cavanaugh.

609
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,580
Yeah, Joseph Dubois.

610
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,210
Joe?

611
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,690
Hi, Terry.

612
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,219
Hi, it's Joe Dubois.

613
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,230
Um, listen, I, uh, I wanted to
get back to you on that, uh...

614
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:49,060
on that, uh, the
Richter-Mullis stock buy.

615
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,439
Yeah, well, you could have
knocked me down with a feather,

616
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,720
but my wife actually went ahead
and she had a dream about it.

617
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,660
She said to go ahead and buy it.

618
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:00,130
But to be sure and do it today.

619
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:15,890
Hey, Lee, this is like
the millionth message.

620
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:16,979
I'm sorry to keep bugging you

621
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,340
but I was wondering what was
happening with our dentist,

622
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,030
Jeremy Crane?

623
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,789
Uh, was he at home?

624
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,069
Did you guys pick him up?

625
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,480
Are you at the park? Uh...

626
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:30,270
Can you just give me a call, please?

627
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,639
All right, don't worry out it.

628
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,150
I'll call you as soon as I can.

629
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,679
Hey, what are you doing?

630
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,160
Returning your call.

631
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,360
In person.

632
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,789
But this...

633
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,689
This looks like a picture of
the woman that I dreamt about.

634
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,189
But she looks dead.

635
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,449
That's 'cause she is dead.

636
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,129
But how can she be dead?

637
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,889
I
- It's barely sundown.

638
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:00,189
You've been staking
out the park all day.

639
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,510
Well, that explains it then.

640
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,409
This girl was found by a security guard

641
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:07,110
dumped behind a restroom
at a truck stop yesterday.

642
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:11,560
And did I mention this truck stop's
20 miles away from Benedict Park?

643
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,989
But I'm confused.

644
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:13,979
What about Jeremy Crane?

645
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,969
Did you find him?

646
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:15,979
Did you arrest him?

647
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,779
Well, I spent the whole
day looking for him.

648
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,780
Finally tracked him down
about an hour ago but, uh,

649
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,576
I won't be arresting him.

650
00:34:22,611 --> 00:34:23,367
Why not?

651
00:34:23,402 --> 00:34:25,699
Cause he's in the intensive care
unit at Casa Valley Hospital.

652
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,239
Has been for the past four months.

653
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,479
That's not possible.

654
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,209
I saw it.

655
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:32,129
I saw him in the park
killing this girl tonight.

656
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,510
You saw wrong.

657
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,599
Jeremy Crane had a
stroke four months ago.

658
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,750
The guy hasn't taken a breath without
the aid of a machine ever since.

659
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,090
He didn't kill this woman.

660
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,529
He didn't kill any of them.

661
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,140
No. Yes.

662
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:46,450
You made a mistake.

663
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,440
Like I did yesterday. Letting
that guy into your home.

664
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,920
But, uh, it's okay, no o got hurt.

665
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,880
We live to fight another day.

666
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,350
Are we talking about yesterday or today?

667
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,749
I'm talking about all of it.

668
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,949
I saw him.

669
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,470
You think you saw him.

670
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,900
I thought I knew who I
was letting in your house.

671
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,080
Go home.

672
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,150
That's what I'm going to do.

673
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,630
You have kids; I have
a pregnant girlfriend.

674
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,499
I know you're sorry, you know I'm sorry.

675
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,549
Let's leave it at that.

676
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,689
No, no, no, you know what?

677
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,980
I'm not sorry.

678
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,179
I saw it; I saw him kill her.

679
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,900
I know what I saw!

680
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,010
You're really not going
to use our bathroom?

681
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,820
Well, not yet.

682
00:35:44,855 --> 00:35:45,866
Not for a while.

683
00:35:45,901 --> 00:35:47,019
I'm just gonna go in the girls' bedroom.

684
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,820
I'll be quiet; I'll
go in their bathroom.

685
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,560
Okay.

686
00:35:51,928 --> 00:35:52,616
Hang on a sec.

687
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:53,800
This is gonna be for you.

688
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,280
Hello?

689
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,390
Joe?

690
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:57,940
Hi, Terry.

691
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,570
Am I disturbing you?

692
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,470
No, uh, just getting ready for bed.

693
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:02,880
Where are you?

694
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,160
Somewhere in the middle of nowhere.

695
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,050
Halfway between heaven and earth.

696
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,109
You all right?

697
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,280
You been drinking?

698
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,430
The answer is yes and yes.

699
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,149
I'm all right.

700
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,870
And I have been drinking.

701
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:24,350
Did you happen to check the
market when it closed this evening?

702
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,470
No, why?

703
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,670
Everything all right?

704
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,860
What did Terry say?

705
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:41,719
Uh, Richter-Mullis.

706
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,940
He was calling about Richter-Mullis.

707
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,450
The stocks?

708
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,800
What about them?

709
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,980
I guess they were up...

710
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,140
...a little bit before lunch.

711
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,830
And then they just fell
off the face of the earth.

712
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,090
The contracts that they were gonna
get they didn't get and the, uh,

713
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,370
contracts that they already had, I guess
the government isn't gonna renew them.

714
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,240
What does this mean?

715
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,870
Um, I gotta start laying people off.

716
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,970
Tomorrow.

717
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,930
I guess the hope is that if
I can lay off enough people,

718
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,490
get my costs down enough, maybe I'll...

719
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,360
I'll still have a company.

720
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,560
Maybe I'll still have a job.

721
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:37,120
Joe, honey, I'm so sorry.

722
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,100
I heard it in my dream
as clear as a bell.

723
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,770
I swear.

724
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,600
I heard it as clear as a bell.

725
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,160
No.

726
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:13,870
Please...

727
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,230
Oh, God, please...

728
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,630
Please, you don't have to do this.

729
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,630
You're right, I don't.

730
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,300
But the thing is.

731
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,309
I want to. No...

732
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,710
Hey! No fair.

733
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,969
You always get to go first.

734
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,240
I'm sorry, you're right.

735
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,990
It's your turn to land the first blow.

736
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,029
Go ahead, Boss, she's all yours.

737
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,090
What the hell's going on down there?

738
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,010
Why didn't you tell me
you were having a party?

739
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,669
Wow, I can't believe it.

740
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,329
You were actually
gonna start without me.

741
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,829
Come on, stop your whining.

742
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,900
You didn't actually miss anything.

743
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,879
So, can I start this thing?

744
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,530
You... You can't do this.

745
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,500
I voted for you.

746
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,970
My goodness.

747
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,170
Your own husband...

748
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,240
Brutalizing that woman.

749
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,990
Aren't you going to call the police?

750
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,430
Oh, that's right.

751
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,599
The police were there.

752
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,760
How do you know that?

753
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,999
How do you know what I just dreamt?

754
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,279
Oh, Allison,

755
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,570
dreams don't just happen. They
have to come from somewhere.

756
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,590
They have to come from someone.

757
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,579
And for the last little ile your
dreams have been coming from me.

758
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,669
What are you saying?

759
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,439
The Bible is very clear.

760
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,069
"For dreams have deceived many,

761
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:57,710
and they have failed that
put their trust in them. "

762
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,210
You put your trust in dreams.

763
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:03,010
You offer yourself as a false prophet.

764
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,390
So, I've been making it my business
to render those dreams useless.

765
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,039
I'm simply doing God's work.

766
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,520
"God's work"?

767
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,270
Why else would he have
allowed me to perish?

768
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,130
So I could be here.

769
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,190
I could do this.

770
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:22,629
So I could make you see that
dentist and his license plate.

771
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,459
That was you?

772
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,899
Or hear about that company

773
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,539
that was so important to your husband.

774
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,629
People are going to lose their jobs.

775
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,880
Everything my husband ever worked for.

776
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:36,510
The Lord moves in mysterious ways.

777
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,710
It isn't ours to question.

778
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,670
Misery and sadness,

779
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,570
murder, brutality,

780
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,739
it's all part of the plan.

781
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,290
All essential to the balance.

782
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,990
And now,

783
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,009
as long as I'm in your head,

784
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:56,569
as long as I'm the
sculptor of your dreams,

785
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:59,060
that balance can be maintained.

786
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,500
Those that are meant to die will.

787
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,259
No Allison Dubois

788
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,960
to foretell their untimely
ends and put a stop to it.

789
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,510
Things will be as they are meant to be.

790
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,910
Sweet dreams...

791
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,340
bitch!
