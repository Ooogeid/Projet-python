1
00:00:01,948 --> 00:00:03,983
It's so annoying, right?

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,051
Yeah. They change the street-cleaning days,

3
00:00:06,119 --> 00:00:08,754
And no one tells you it's on Tuesday now.

4
00:00:08,822 --> 00:00:11,223
I got a $65 ticket.

5
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:12,958
Yeah, I probably should fight it,

6
00:00:13,026 --> 00:00:14,394
But I mean, come on, who has time

7
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:17,030
To take a half day off
and go to traffic court?

8
00:00:17,097 --> 00:00:20,600
all right, well,
I got to take a shower, so...

9
00:00:20,668 --> 00:00:23,336
We're still on for tonight, though, right?

10
00:00:23,404 --> 00:00:24,337
Okay.

11
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:27,073
Yep, I will see you then. Bye.

12
00:00:28,776 --> 00:00:31,644
Well... Looks like it's
your lucky day, jinx.

13
00:00:31,712 --> 00:00:34,914
I am all out of dry food.

14
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:38,284
Oh.

15
00:00:38,352 --> 00:00:39,385
Hello?

16
00:00:39,453 --> 00:00:40,520
Naomi?

17
00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:43,089
Uh, no, I'm sorry, this is gretchen.

18
00:00:43,157 --> 00:00:45,658
Oh. I'm sorry.

19
00:00:45,726 --> 00:00:46,959
Is naomi there?

20
00:00:47,027 --> 00:00:49,429
Uh, no, there's no one named naomi here,

21
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:52,098
So, um, I think you have the wrong number.

22
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,166
Really?

23
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:54,467
No, she has to be.

24
00:00:54,535 --> 00:00:56,069
She waited on me the other night,

25
00:00:56,136 --> 00:00:57,837
And we kind of hit it off.

26
00:00:57,905 --> 00:00:59,372
This is the number she gave me.

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,408
Yeah, well, I'm sorry to be
the one to break it to you,

28
00:01:02,476 --> 00:01:05,311
But I think maybe this naomi,
whoever she is,

29
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,847
She might not want to actually talk to you,

30
00:01:07,915 --> 00:01:10,016
So... Sorry. Bye.

31
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:13,086
All right, jinx, chow time.

32
00:01:13,153 --> 00:01:14,620
Hop to it.

33
00:01:15,656 --> 00:01:17,290
Lazy dog.

34
00:01:20,594 --> 00:01:21,594
Hello?

35
00:01:21,662 --> 00:01:23,429
Okay, here's the thing.

36
00:01:23,497 --> 00:01:25,131
I know naomi's there,

37
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:27,934
So stop playing around
and let me talk to her.

38
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:30,036
Wow, you've really got a problem.

39
00:01:30,104 --> 00:01:32,138
Now, listen to me, okay?

40
00:01:32,206 --> 00:01:34,006
There is no naomi here,

41
00:01:34,074 --> 00:01:36,275
There are no waitresses that live here,

42
00:01:36,343 --> 00:01:39,312
And there is no one here
that wants to talk to you.

43
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,447
Yes, there is... 

44
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,651
Hey. Up and at 'em.

45
00:01:50,023 --> 00:01:51,624
Oh, my god.

46
00:01:51,692 --> 00:01:52,959
Jinx?

47
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,834
Oh, my god...

48
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,203
Hello?

49
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:07,006
Tell that bitch naomi to come to the phone.

50
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:08,641
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

51
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:09,976
Stop calling me, okay?

52
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:11,878
I can't deal with you right now.

53
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:13,246
I have an emergency.

54
00:02:13,313 --> 00:02:17,650
A dead dog is not an emergency.

55
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:20,820
Who is this?

56
00:02:23,357 --> 00:02:24,924
Okay... 

57
00:02:24,992 --> 00:02:26,993
I'm gonna go get your... Your pen,

58
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,362
A-and I'm taking you to the vet.

59
00:02:40,107 --> 00:02:50,043
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

60
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,604
When you're finished,
bring your plates to the sink.

61
00:03:27,672 --> 00:03:29,939
It's almost 8:00. We got to get a move on.

62
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:31,274
Dad? Yeah?

63
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:33,743
Wh-why are you dressed like that?

64
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,145
I mean, aren't you going to work today?

65
00:03:36,213 --> 00:03:37,346
Uh, yes, I am.

66
00:03:37,414 --> 00:03:38,948
I'm meeting my boss for lunch,

67
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:42,985
And he's kind of a laid-back,
casual kind of guy, so...

68
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:45,454
So you decided to dress sloppy?

69
00:03:45,522 --> 00:03:47,657
Does, uh,

70
00:03:47,724 --> 00:03:49,625
Does mom know you're dressed that way?

71
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:52,461
Mom is not here. Mom went to work early.

72
00:03:52,529 --> 00:03:54,497
And besides, she's your mom, she's not mine.

73
00:03:54,564 --> 00:03:57,333
I decide what is appropriate
for me to wear to work.

74
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:58,701
Well, it, um,

75
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:00,736
It just seems strange.

76
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:01,837
Yes, it is strange.

77
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:03,339
This guy never has lunch with anyone,

78
00:04:03,407 --> 00:04:04,874
And suddenly he shoots me an e-mail

79
00:04:04,941 --> 00:04:06,609
Saying he wants to eat with me today.

80
00:04:06,677 --> 00:04:08,144
I know where he likes to go.

81
00:04:08,211 --> 00:04:10,012
It's just this little
hole in the wall, so...

82
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,147
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

83
00:04:11,214 --> 00:04:13,049
Y-you're the one who's always telling us

84
00:04:13,116 --> 00:04:14,617
To "be yourself."

85
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:15,818
Well, come on, this is me.

86
00:04:15,886 --> 00:04:17,653
This is just more of a-a weekend kind of me.

87
00:04:17,721 --> 00:04:19,221
Uh...

88
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,692
You know what? I'm gonna change.

89
00:04:26,296 --> 00:04:28,431
Naomi clark

90
00:04:28,498 --> 00:04:30,199
Has been missing for five days now.

91
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:32,468
Isn't it safe to assume
she's already been murdered?

92
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:33,769
Absolutely not.

93
00:04:33,837 --> 00:04:35,971
Miss clarke is still
classified as a missing person.

94
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:37,973
But the three other victims were all dead

95
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,709
Within five days of being abducted.

96
00:04:39,776 --> 00:04:41,977
That's true, that has
been the pattern thus far,

97
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:43,979
But that doesn't mean it's
a foregone conclusion.

98
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:45,715
Naomi clarke's family is holding out hope

99
00:04:45,782 --> 00:04:47,717
That she's still alive, and so am I.

100
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:49,785
Other than that,

101
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:51,487
I don't have much new to report.

102
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:53,923
The mayor is doubling the
size of the task force,

103
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,358
Uh, devoted to finding the killer,

104
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:56,592
And we are aggressively pursuing

105
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,561
Each and every lead as it comes in.

106
00:04:58,628 --> 00:05:00,463
So what do you make of his name,

107
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,931
"the penny jar killer"?

108
00:05:01,998 --> 00:05:04,367
You know, 'cause he leaves
the body of his last victim

109
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:06,001
Inside the home of his next victim?

110
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:08,738
"take a penny, leave a penny." cute, right?

111
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:11,841
The man slaughters innocent women.

112
00:05:11,908 --> 00:05:13,843
There's nothing cute about him.

113
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,511
Now, if you'll excuse me.

114
00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:20,916
yeah, that's her, naomi clarke.

115
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:22,318
The killer left her body

116
00:05:22,386 --> 00:05:25,221
In what I can only guess
is the next victim's house.

117
00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:26,856
She was hanging in the closet.

118
00:05:26,923 --> 00:05:28,491
She was bound by electrical tape.

119
00:05:28,558 --> 00:05:30,359
She was still wearing her waitress uniform.

120
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:32,495
It had a name tag that said "naomi."

121
00:05:32,562 --> 00:05:34,730
And you got a good look at this next victim?

122
00:05:34,798 --> 00:05:37,800
I know her first name's gretchen.

123
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:40,136
Oh, uh, and in the... In the dream,

124
00:05:40,203 --> 00:05:42,938
She-she'd gotten a parking ticket.

125
00:05:43,006 --> 00:05:46,242
For parking on the wrong side of
the street for street-cleaning.

126
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:47,710
It was Tuesday.

127
00:05:47,778 --> 00:05:49,078
Today's a Tuesday.

128
00:05:49,146 --> 00:05:51,814
Traffic ticket-- I might be
able to do something with that.

129
00:05:51,882 --> 00:05:53,182
Traffic police use handheld computers

130
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,583
To give out tickets now.

131
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:56,085
They go right on to the system.

132
00:05:56,153 --> 00:05:57,453
I'll get someone to monitor it.

133
00:05:57,521 --> 00:05:59,021
Soon as we hear that a car

134
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:01,056
Registered to a woman named
gretchen gets a ticket,

135
00:06:01,124 --> 00:06:03,392
We should be able to
find out where she lives.

136
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:07,897
* *

137
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,169
Keith!

138
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:14,570
Hi.

139
00:06:14,638 --> 00:06:15,905
Joe.

140
00:06:15,972 --> 00:06:17,473
Hey.

141
00:06:19,676 --> 00:06:21,410
I appreciate this.

142
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:22,912
No, listen, got to eat lunch.

143
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:25,147
I just, uh, you didn't
mention in your e-mail

144
00:06:25,215 --> 00:06:27,683
Why you wanted to get together,
so I, uh, I just...

145
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:30,052
I didn't quite know if I was
supposed to prepare something...

146
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,487
It's not about your performance review

147
00:06:31,555 --> 00:06:32,822
Or anything like that.

148
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:34,690
I mean, I'm very aware that that's tomorrow.

149
00:06:34,758 --> 00:06:36,592
So you can put your mind at ease.

150
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,227
It has nothing to do with that.

151
00:06:38,295 --> 00:06:40,496
In fact, I'd go as far as to say

152
00:06:40,564 --> 00:06:43,065
That you have nothing to
worry about in that regard.

153
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:44,767
Oh. Hi there.

154
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:47,069
Oh, that's okay, I'll just
have what I always have.

155
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:49,405
Oh, I'll just have what he's having.

156
00:06:49,473 --> 00:06:52,041
Sure you want to do that?

157
00:06:52,108 --> 00:06:53,042
Sure.

158
00:06:53,109 --> 00:06:54,610
Sure I'm sure.

159
00:06:56,112 --> 00:06:59,114
I'll tell you why I e-mailed you.

160
00:07:00,283 --> 00:07:02,451
The truth is...

161
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,487
I need a favor.

162
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:06,889
Oh, sure, keith, no problem.

163
00:07:06,957 --> 00:07:08,924
What can I do for you?

164
00:07:08,992 --> 00:07:10,893
Well, when I think of you,

165
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:12,962
As opposed to anybody else I work with,

166
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:14,964
Any of the other engineers,

167
00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:20,569
I think of you as someone
who is very... Regular.

168
00:07:20,637 --> 00:07:23,272
Regular? Yeah.

169
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,673
Regular, you know?

170
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:26,342
Like, not strange.

171
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:28,010
Pretty normal, right?

172
00:07:28,078 --> 00:07:29,979
Y-you're married, you have a family,

173
00:07:30,046 --> 00:07:31,580
You have some kids.

174
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:34,450
Yeah, I'm-I'm... I'm pretty regular.

175
00:07:34,518 --> 00:07:37,453
Good. Because I'd like to
share something with you

176
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:40,356
That I haven't shared with
anybody else I work with.

177
00:07:40,423 --> 00:07:42,157
Okay.

178
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,933
There you go.

179
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:52,801
What's this?

180
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:55,104
That is my novel.

181
00:07:55,171 --> 00:07:56,539
It's on that drive.

182
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:58,774
I want you to read it,

183
00:07:58,842 --> 00:08:01,443
And I want you to be
brutally honest with me.

184
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:03,145
Your novel?

185
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:04,446
Yeah.

186
00:08:04,514 --> 00:08:07,416
I started writing it when...

187
00:08:07,484 --> 00:08:10,586
<i>When did the first lord of the rings movie
come out?</i>

188
00:08:10,654 --> 00:08:11,720
Uh...

189
00:08:11,788 --> 00:08:13,122
Here's your chocolate milk.

190
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:15,558
And here's your chocolate milk.

191
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:19,828
Your entrees will be right out.

192
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:21,330
Great. Great.

193
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:23,666
Great.

194
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:25,234
Thank you.

195
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:30,873
Okay, turns out there was
a girl named gretchen,

196
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:32,908
And she did get a parking ticket.

197
00:08:32,976 --> 00:08:34,944
Gretchen morgan got a parking
ticket at 11:25 this morning.

198
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:36,645
I'm on my way over to her place now.

199
00:08:36,713 --> 00:08:38,681
You want come in my car,
or you want to follow?

200
00:08:41,585 --> 00:08:44,453
Wait a second, you're
telling me that that man,

201
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:47,656
The penny jar killer,
you think he's after me?

202
00:08:47,724 --> 00:08:50,292
Well, again, we're responding
to an anonymous tip.

203
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,927
Um, it may turn out

204
00:08:51,995 --> 00:08:55,564
To be nothing once we take a look around.

205
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:03,005
Lee.

206
00:09:04,507 --> 00:09:06,208
Oh.

207
00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:08,444
Excuse me for one second.

208
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:28,097
What about your dog?

209
00:09:28,164 --> 00:09:29,164
Excuse me?

210
00:09:29,232 --> 00:09:30,799
You have a dog, don't you?

211
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:33,202
Jinxy, wake up.

212
00:09:35,071 --> 00:09:36,405
Baby.

213
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:40,809
Oh, my god.

214
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,566
Hey, lee. Lee.

215
00:10:06,936 --> 00:10:10,673
You see that kid over there,
he's got black work gloves?

216
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,207
Got the same kind of tape

217
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:13,809
That I saw covering naomi's mouth.

218
00:10:17,614 --> 00:10:18,947
Sir, police.

219
00:10:19,015 --> 00:10:21,650
You mind if I ask you a couple of questions?

220
00:10:34,564 --> 00:10:36,632
Name's jeremy kiernan.

221
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,167
Couple of priors for drug possession;

222
00:10:38,234 --> 00:10:39,368
One conviction for harassment.

223
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:40,703
Harassment?

224
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,371
Legalese for "stalking."

225
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:45,107
22-year-old girl-- 30 days plus probation.

226
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:46,475
So you think this is him?

227
00:10:46,543 --> 00:10:48,310
You think this is the penny jar killer?

228
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:50,145
Well, it's sure starting to look that way.

229
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:52,014
Electrician's assistant lived about

230
00:10:52,082 --> 00:10:53,615
A mile away from gretchen's house.

231
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:56,618
His job took him close to the
homes of the other victims.

232
00:10:56,686 --> 00:10:57,886
We may have a match.

233
00:10:57,954 --> 00:11:00,789
I got people scouring his
apartment and his car.

234
00:11:00,857 --> 00:11:02,891
He's got to be hiding the
body of that other girl,

235
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,226
The, uh, the waitress somewhere.

236
00:11:04,294 --> 00:11:06,662
Plus, you don't turn tail
and run from the cops

237
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,164
If you don't have something to hide.

238
00:11:09,232 --> 00:11:11,133
I'm gonna go call manny, give him an update.

239
00:11:11,201 --> 00:11:12,835
But, uh, thanks for the "anonymous tip."

240
00:11:12,902 --> 00:11:14,570
Mm-hmm.

241
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:18,540
I wasn't running because of that.

242
00:11:22,846 --> 00:11:23,979
I'm sorry?

243
00:11:24,047 --> 00:11:27,516
I wasn't running because I killed someone.

244
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:30,552
I would never kill anybody.

245
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,354
I heard what that guy said.

246
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:35,491
A long time ago,

247
00:11:35,558 --> 00:11:37,926
There was a girl.

248
00:11:37,994 --> 00:11:40,662
I liked her more than she liked me.

249
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,599
You want to call that stalking.

250
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,802
But following someone,
calling them on the phone too much,

251
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,036
That's not murder.

252
00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:49,605
Okay.

253
00:11:49,672 --> 00:11:51,106
So why did you run then?

254
00:11:51,174 --> 00:11:53,809
I had a joint in my pocket.

255
00:11:55,812 --> 00:11:58,647
Would've been my third strike.

256
00:11:58,715 --> 00:12:00,048
You would've run, too.

257
00:12:02,085 --> 00:12:04,052
Okay, then explain the gloves.

258
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,854
Explain the electrical tape.

259
00:12:05,922 --> 00:12:08,957
I'm an electrician.

260
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:12,594
Okay, well, I believe that,
but the rest of this...

261
00:12:12,662 --> 00:12:13,595
So...

262
00:12:13,663 --> 00:12:16,431
What can I do to convince you?

263
00:12:19,469 --> 00:12:20,569
Sorry.

264
00:12:20,637 --> 00:12:21,637
I startle you?

265
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:29,778
<i> I just don't get it.</i>

266
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:31,146
<i>Why wouldn't he admit it?</i>

267
00:12:31,214 --> 00:12:33,015
Tell me where the girl's body is?

268
00:12:33,082 --> 00:12:34,850
What's the point in denying everything?

269
00:12:34,918 --> 00:12:36,652
He's dead.

270
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:38,654
Well, he just got hit by a car.

271
00:12:38,721 --> 00:12:40,789
That can have a way of
clouding your thinking.

272
00:12:40,857 --> 00:12:42,090
Plus, he's a murderer.

273
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:44,426
I mean, I haven't actually
read the rule book,

274
00:12:44,494 --> 00:12:48,030
But my guess is that the number
one rule at serial killer club

275
00:12:48,097 --> 00:12:51,099
Is that if somebody asks
you if you are one, say no.

276
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,601
Actually, I wish I was reading

277
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:54,636
The serial killer club rule book.

278
00:12:54,704 --> 00:12:56,371
It's that bad?

279
00:12:58,741 --> 00:13:00,742
I'm, I mean, I'm just a hundred pages in,

280
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,812
But, I mean, maybe it'll pick up, but...

281
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,948
This thing sucks like a hoover.

282
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,016
I should be grateful.

283
00:13:08,084 --> 00:13:09,518
At least he gave it to me

284
00:13:09,586 --> 00:13:11,753
The day before my performance review.

285
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:14,223
I mean, he can't expect me to
read this thing in one night.

286
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,325
It's over 900 pages.

287
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:24,132
Hello.

288
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,567
Hey, it's lee.

289
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:28,370
Sorry to bug you at home, but,
uh, I got some bad news.

290
00:13:28,438 --> 00:13:29,838
When we left gretchen morgan's place today,

291
00:13:29,906 --> 00:13:31,106
She was pretty shaken up.

292
00:13:31,174 --> 00:13:33,008
She had a friend come
spend the night with her.

293
00:13:33,076 --> 00:13:34,343
He went out to grab some takeout,

294
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,911
And when he came back, she was gone.

295
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:37,145
Oh, no.

296
00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:38,180
Oh, yeah.

297
00:13:38,248 --> 00:13:39,781
And when we opened up the closet,

298
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:41,950
We found naomi clarke.

299
00:13:42,018 --> 00:13:43,819
Looks like we were wrong, allison.

300
00:13:43,887 --> 00:13:45,854
Unless this guy got up off that morgue slab

301
00:13:45,922 --> 00:13:47,689
And strung this girl up by her wrists,

302
00:13:47,757 --> 00:13:50,659
Jeremy kiernan was not the penny jar killer.

303
00:14:01,036 --> 00:14:02,637
It's not my fault.

304
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:03,938
I didn't make a peep.

305
00:14:04,006 --> 00:14:06,341
It's your brain; I can hear it whirring.

306
00:14:06,408 --> 00:14:09,978
I can't help it, it is whirring.

307
00:14:10,045 --> 00:14:12,180
I just feel terrible.

308
00:14:12,248 --> 00:14:14,349
That man is dead.

309
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,051
He'd be alive if I hadn't
pointed him out to the police.

310
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:18,052
Okay.

311
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,788
Maybe.

312
00:14:20,856 --> 00:14:22,657
We can't be sure.

313
00:14:22,725 --> 00:14:23,725
Can't we?

314
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:25,360
No. You're not god.

315
00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:27,629
At least not last time I looked.

316
00:14:27,696 --> 00:14:29,831
I don't even want to think
about what that would make me.

317
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:31,065
Okay, not funny.

318
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:32,400
You're joking and I feel like

319
00:14:32,468 --> 00:14:34,602
I've got this man's blood on my hands.

320
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,803
You don't.

321
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:37,705
You didn't put that joint in his pocket.

322
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:39,774
You didn't make him run.

323
00:14:39,842 --> 00:14:41,242
Maybe not.

324
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,245
Still, some job I did today.

325
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,856
* imagine me and you, I do *

326
00:14:54,924 --> 00:14:57,191
* I think about you day and night *

327
00:14:57,259 --> 00:14:58,359
* it's only right *

328
00:14:58,427 --> 00:15:01,529
* to think about the girl you love *

329
00:15:01,597 --> 00:15:03,097
* and hold her tight *

330
00:15:03,165 --> 00:15:05,433
* so happy together *

331
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,738
* if I should call you up, invest a dime *

332
00:15:10,806 --> 00:15:14,442
* and you say you belong
to me and ease my mind *

333
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:18,746
* imagine how the world could be,
so very fine *

334
00:15:18,814 --> 00:15:23,918
* so happy together *

335
00:15:23,986 --> 00:15:27,922
* I can't see me loving nobody but you *

336
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,859
* for all my life *

337
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:34,529
* when you're with me, baby *

338
00:15:34,597 --> 00:15:39,734
* the skies will be blue for all my life *

339
00:15:39,802 --> 00:15:42,537
* me and you and you and me *

340
00:15:42,605 --> 00:15:46,641
* no matter how they tossed
the dice, it had to be *

341
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:50,278
* the only one for me
is you and you for me *

342
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:55,783
* so happy together *

343
00:16:13,702 --> 00:16:14,802
* me and you... *

344
00:16:19,475 --> 00:16:21,042
She's amazing, isn't she?

345
00:16:27,883 --> 00:16:30,785
I hate being dead.

346
00:16:32,488 --> 00:16:34,389
Jeremy...

347
00:16:34,456 --> 00:16:37,358
What are you doing here?

348
00:16:37,426 --> 00:16:41,262
Well, seeing as how I'm not a serial killer,

349
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,866
And now you know I'm not a serial killer,

350
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:47,535
And seeing as how you and
your friends kind of,

351
00:16:47,603 --> 00:16:49,437
You know, killed me today,

352
00:16:49,505 --> 00:16:54,242
And seeing as how you're the
only one who can see me,

353
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:57,311
I was hoping we could talk about something.

354
00:16:59,615 --> 00:17:01,616
Not here.

355
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:03,818
<i> You want me to talk to
your girlfriend?</i>

356
00:17:03,886 --> 00:17:07,889
I need her to know that...

357
00:17:07,956 --> 00:17:10,658
I love her.

358
00:17:10,726 --> 00:17:13,361
And I need her to know about you.

359
00:17:15,397 --> 00:17:16,564
About me?

360
00:17:16,632 --> 00:17:19,067
I need her to know that

361
00:17:19,134 --> 00:17:23,738
Even though it feels like I'm gone,
I'm still here.

362
00:17:23,806 --> 00:17:26,374
I can still help her.

363
00:17:26,442 --> 00:17:29,711
'cause I can see her and you can see me,

364
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:31,913
So I can still be there for her.

365
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,415
I can help her do the
things she needs to do.

366
00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:36,017
Wait a second.

367
00:17:36,085 --> 00:17:39,620
Let's just take me out of this for a second.

368
00:17:39,688 --> 00:17:43,024
I don't think those kinds of things...

369
00:17:43,092 --> 00:17:44,859
Can be said.

370
00:17:44,927 --> 00:17:49,263
Those are the kinds of
things that need to be felt.

371
00:17:49,331 --> 00:17:52,667
And the truth is, once her pain subsides,

372
00:17:52,735 --> 00:17:54,769
She will feel them.

373
00:17:54,837 --> 00:17:56,671
So you won't do it?

374
00:17:56,739 --> 00:17:58,039
I don't think it's smart.

375
00:17:58,107 --> 00:18:00,007
No.

376
00:18:00,075 --> 00:18:04,045
I mean, and the truth is,
once your pain subsides,

377
00:18:04,113 --> 00:18:06,814
You're not gonna want to hang around here.

378
00:18:06,882 --> 00:18:09,383
You're gonna want to move on

379
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:12,253
To wherever it is that
you're supposed to go.

380
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:16,591
You don't get it.

381
00:18:16,658 --> 00:18:19,393
Our love is different.

382
00:18:19,461 --> 00:18:21,462
Our love is forever.

383
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,498
I know that you believe that.

384
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:24,866
I'm not saying that's not true.

385
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:28,236
And you got to know that I feel horrible

386
00:18:28,303 --> 00:18:31,806
About everything that has happened to you.

387
00:18:31,874 --> 00:18:33,307
But I just can't do it.

388
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,443
I just, I can't do something that I know

389
00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:38,312
Is gonna cause a lot of
heartache down the line.

390
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,947
I just can't do it.

391
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,718
So what about that penny jar guy?

392
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:45,319
What?

393
00:18:45,387 --> 00:18:46,654
What about him?

394
00:18:48,524 --> 00:18:52,460
I can see everything from here.

395
00:18:52,528 --> 00:18:55,863
I'm pretty sure, if I put my mind to it,

396
00:18:55,931 --> 00:18:58,933
I could find out who he is for you.

397
00:18:59,001 --> 00:19:01,169
And I'd be willing to do that.

398
00:19:01,236 --> 00:19:04,739
I'd be willing to help you.

399
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:07,675
But I need you to be willing to help me.

400
00:19:13,715 --> 00:19:17,251
Oh, uh, hey, brian,
can you give us a couple of minutes?

401
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:19,320
Absolutely.

402
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,363
So?

403
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:30,464
So?

404
00:19:30,532 --> 00:19:31,465
What'd you think?

405
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:34,202
The book?

406
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:36,137
Uh, well, I mean, I'm only about

407
00:19:36,205 --> 00:19:38,506
A hundred and so pages into it, so...

408
00:19:38,574 --> 00:19:40,541
Wow.

409
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:41,576
Okay.

410
00:19:41,643 --> 00:19:43,511
So you were able to put it down?

411
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:45,146
Well, I'm not saying it was easy.

412
00:19:45,214 --> 00:19:46,180
No.

413
00:19:46,248 --> 00:19:47,548
But, you know, like you said yesterday,

414
00:19:47,616 --> 00:19:49,784
I'm kind of a regular guy,
so, you know, I got kids

415
00:19:49,852 --> 00:19:51,819
To put to bed, I got a wife I got

416
00:19:51,887 --> 00:19:53,254
To spend some time with. Yeah, no, no.

417
00:19:53,322 --> 00:19:54,822
Of course, of course.

418
00:19:56,825 --> 00:19:58,826
So what'd you think?

419
00:20:00,863 --> 00:20:03,798
From what I've read?

420
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:05,199
You really want that?

421
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:07,368
Wouldn't you rather wait
till I finish the whole thing

422
00:20:07,436 --> 00:20:08,669
Before I give you an opinion?

423
00:20:08,737 --> 00:20:10,705
Uh, no.

424
00:20:10,772 --> 00:20:13,407
I mean, is there some rule
that says you can't give me

425
00:20:13,475 --> 00:20:16,677
An opinion now and then another
opinion when you're finished?

426
00:20:16,745 --> 00:20:17,678
No.

427
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:19,747
No, I s-suppose not.

428
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,952
So...

429
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,821
So, uh...

430
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:29,657
Yeah, so...

431
00:20:29,725 --> 00:20:31,425
I think it's-it's interesting.

432
00:20:31,493 --> 00:20:33,694
That's it?

433
00:20:33,762 --> 00:20:35,029
Just interesting?

434
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:37,899
No, it's not just interesting.

435
00:20:37,966 --> 00:20:39,767
I think you made some brave choices.

436
00:20:39,835 --> 00:20:43,070
Thank you.

437
00:20:43,138 --> 00:20:47,541
Look, I-I know that this
is really awkward for you,

438
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:49,543
But I want you to be honest with me.

439
00:20:49,611 --> 00:20:51,479
I am, I am. I'm being honest.

440
00:20:51,546 --> 00:20:54,949
No, I know you're being honest.

441
00:20:55,017 --> 00:20:59,487
If I forced you, if I,
if I made you say something negative...

442
00:20:59,554 --> 00:21:01,923
You want something negative?

443
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,257
There's-there's got to be something.

444
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:04,558
Right?

445
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:06,360
You know, you put it down, so...

446
00:21:06,428 --> 00:21:07,561
I know this is hard.

447
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:08,763
I just... Well, it is hard.

448
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,164
You know, I'm not, I'm not having

449
00:21:10,232 --> 00:21:11,632
A negative experience, uh, so far.

450
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,501
So I don't know if I'm
comfortable being negative.

451
00:21:13,568 --> 00:21:15,202
You're not being negative.

452
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,838
You know, I'm-I'm asking
you to be constructive.

453
00:21:17,906 --> 00:21:19,874
Right?

454
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:22,677
Can you give me, uh, a word?

455
00:21:22,744 --> 00:21:23,945
Like, one word.

456
00:21:24,012 --> 00:21:27,581
An-an adjective, a negative adjective.

457
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:28,783
Can-can you do that?

458
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,551
I don't know.

459
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:32,086
Yeah, you can.

460
00:21:32,154 --> 00:21:33,487
Just-just think.

461
00:21:33,555 --> 00:21:35,156
I don't know.

462
00:21:35,223 --> 00:21:37,325
I don't know.

463
00:21:37,392 --> 00:21:40,328
Uh, maybe... Diffuse?

464
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:45,032
Diffuse?

465
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,102
What the hell does that mean?

466
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,572
Diffuse, uh, well, let me see-- diffuse--

467
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,575
It means kind, like, all over the place.

468
00:21:54,643 --> 00:21:57,211
I know what it means.

469
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,081
Well, you know, that's not
necessarily a bad thing.

470
00:22:00,148 --> 00:22:02,149
Diffuse.

471
00:22:02,217 --> 00:22:04,018
Again, I'm only a hundred pages in.

472
00:22:04,086 --> 00:22:06,053
So you know, I think I need time to...

473
00:22:06,121 --> 00:22:07,955
Well, I want to see how the whole thing

474
00:22:08,023 --> 00:22:09,991
Comes together, you know.

475
00:22:10,058 --> 00:22:13,461
That's why I really didn't
want to say anything yet.

476
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:18,499
Diffuse.

477
00:22:25,707 --> 00:22:28,709
Okay, well, I got her favorite band.

478
00:22:28,777 --> 00:22:31,779
Got her favorite flowers.

479
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:36,384
And got a fistful of articles about myself.

480
00:22:36,451 --> 00:22:38,853
Yeah, and if all that fails, just remember--

481
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,088
Tell her to look in the
hatbox in the closet.

482
00:22:41,156 --> 00:22:43,124
Hatbox?

483
00:22:43,191 --> 00:22:45,760
Right.

484
00:22:54,536 --> 00:22:56,670
Can I help you?

485
00:22:56,738 --> 00:22:57,838
Mandy, hi.

486
00:22:57,906 --> 00:22:59,006
My name is allison dubois.

487
00:22:59,074 --> 00:23:00,708
I'm a friend of...

488
00:23:00,776 --> 00:23:03,344
I was a friend of jeremy's.

489
00:23:03,412 --> 00:23:06,881
I just want to tell you how sorry I am.

490
00:23:06,948 --> 00:23:08,616
Okay. Thank you.

491
00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:10,384
I'm sorry, he never mentioned you.

492
00:23:10,452 --> 00:23:12,319
Oh, no, he wouldn't have.

493
00:23:12,387 --> 00:23:14,488
We didn't actually meet till yesterday.

494
00:23:14,556 --> 00:23:17,391
I work for the district attorney's office.

495
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:20,261
And I was investigating
the penny jar killer.

496
00:23:20,328 --> 00:23:21,896
Oh.

497
00:23:21,963 --> 00:23:24,532
God, you were there.

498
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:26,434
Did you see it happen?

499
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:29,737
I was, and I did.

500
00:23:29,805 --> 00:23:31,639
He wanted me to give you these.

501
00:23:31,706 --> 00:23:33,974
He said they're your favorite flower.

502
00:23:35,944 --> 00:23:38,012
He said that?

503
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,316
After the car hit him.

504
00:23:42,384 --> 00:23:44,552
I didn't realize.

505
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:47,154
I guess I wanted to believe
it happened quickly--

506
00:23:47,222 --> 00:23:48,756
That he didn't suffer.

507
00:23:48,824 --> 00:23:50,658
Oh, no, he didn't.

508
00:23:50,725 --> 00:23:52,660
It happened quickly.

509
00:23:52,727 --> 00:23:57,531
Um, he-he also wanted me to give you these.

510
00:23:59,501 --> 00:24:01,836
Sorry, what are these?

511
00:24:01,903 --> 00:24:07,007
Some-- some articles about me, about how I--

512
00:24:07,075 --> 00:24:09,143
How sometimes I see the dead.

513
00:24:09,211 --> 00:24:12,980
How I can communicate with the dead.

514
00:24:13,048 --> 00:24:15,916
Okay, this is unspeakably cruel.

515
00:24:15,984 --> 00:24:18,085
He thought that you might react like that.

516
00:24:18,153 --> 00:24:20,521
That's why he said those
are your favorite flowers,

517
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:22,323
This is your favorite band...

518
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:26,627
Right. Look, I have a funeral to prepare.

519
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:29,530
People to call, arrangements to make.

520
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:31,732
So I'm going to go back in the house now,

521
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,201
Shut the door and ask you
to leave my property.

522
00:24:34,269 --> 00:24:37,571
He wants you to know that he's watching you,

523
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:39,273
And that he loves you

524
00:24:39,341 --> 00:24:41,275
And if there's anything you
ever need to say to him,

525
00:24:41,343 --> 00:24:42,810
You can say it through me.

526
00:24:42,878 --> 00:24:44,612
Look, I hear you, but just so you know,

527
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:47,648
If I have anything to say to him,
I'm going to say it to him

528
00:24:47,716 --> 00:24:50,151
In my own way and my own time,
thank you very much.

529
00:24:50,218 --> 00:24:51,986
Oh, wait, wait.

530
00:24:52,053 --> 00:24:54,955
The hatbox, he wants you to look
in the hatbox in the closet.

531
00:24:55,023 --> 00:24:57,625
He wants you to look in there...

532
00:25:04,966 --> 00:25:06,433
Al, what do you think?

533
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:07,701
Al?

534
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:11,405
Yeah, I think it, um, looks good.

535
00:25:11,473 --> 00:25:13,073
I think it's fine.

536
00:25:13,141 --> 00:25:15,376
Well, it's my performance review,

537
00:25:15,443 --> 00:25:17,611
So I was kind of hoping
for better than fine.

538
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,746
You're gonna do great.

539
00:25:18,813 --> 00:25:20,781
Look, he's told you already

540
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:22,683
That you don't have anything to worry about.

541
00:25:22,751 --> 00:25:25,819
Yeah, that was before I let him down

542
00:25:25,887 --> 00:25:28,656
By not reading his entire 90
0-page opus in one night

543
00:25:28,723 --> 00:25:30,658
And declaring it a work of genius.

544
00:25:30,725 --> 00:25:34,428
One thing has nothing to do with the other.

545
00:25:34,496 --> 00:25:36,830
Take it from someone who knows nothing has

546
00:25:36,898 --> 00:25:38,666
Anything to do with anything.

547
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:40,267
Come on, al.

548
00:25:40,335 --> 00:25:41,835
What did you expect?

549
00:25:41,903 --> 00:25:43,637
The man just died.

550
00:25:43,705 --> 00:25:45,673
The woman just lost her boyfriend.

551
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,342
I know, I know, I know.

552
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:51,478
It's just-- he said "
you do this and I'll do that."

553
00:25:51,546 --> 00:25:53,581
So I did this.

554
00:25:53,648 --> 00:25:55,049
He just disappeared,

555
00:25:55,116 --> 00:25:57,184
And I haven't seen him
or heard from him since.

556
00:26:27,949 --> 00:26:29,149
Hello?

557
00:26:29,217 --> 00:26:31,452
Where am I?

558
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:32,720
Anybody here?

559
00:26:37,292 --> 00:26:39,226
Can you help me?

560
00:26:39,294 --> 00:26:43,097
I don't feel well,
and I don't know where I am.

561
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,102
Please.

562
00:26:54,843 --> 00:26:57,678
<i> Hey... Hey wake up.</i>

563
00:27:00,715 --> 00:27:02,049
Oh, good, you're awake.

564
00:27:02,117 --> 00:27:03,817
We need to talk.

565
00:27:03,885 --> 00:27:06,754
Jeremy, I didn't think I
was going to see you again.

566
00:27:06,821 --> 00:27:10,124
Did you do that on purpose?

567
00:27:10,191 --> 00:27:12,159
Did I just do what on purpose?

568
00:27:12,227 --> 00:27:13,794
I was having a dream,

569
00:27:13,862 --> 00:27:16,563
And in it I was just about to see the face

570
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:18,465
Of the penny jar killer.

571
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:20,467
But right before it happened,
you woke me up.

572
00:27:20,535 --> 00:27:23,170
Oh, I'm sorry.

573
00:27:23,238 --> 00:27:25,005
I had no idea.

574
00:27:25,073 --> 00:27:26,807
But, look, I don't think it matters.

575
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:29,343
I mean, that's what I'm here for.

576
00:27:29,411 --> 00:27:31,145
I found out who the guy is.

577
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:37,635
So he really does exist.

578
00:27:37,703 --> 00:27:40,037
Shane malinowski? He sure does.

579
00:27:40,105 --> 00:27:41,706
Soon as I punched his name into the system,

580
00:27:41,773 --> 00:27:42,807
The printer went into overdrive.

581
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:44,542
Look at this guy's record.

582
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,278
He's the poster child for social deviants.

583
00:27:47,346 --> 00:27:49,380
Like an accident waiting to happen.

584
00:27:49,448 --> 00:27:52,116
And you're confident this is
the man we're looking for?

585
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:54,085
The late jeremy kiernan is confident.

586
00:27:54,153 --> 00:27:55,720
He's the one who gave me his name.

587
00:27:55,787 --> 00:27:59,423
And he is in a place to know.

588
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:00,791
He also told me

589
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:02,527
That malinowski spent his
mornings in humboldt park.

590
00:28:02,594 --> 00:28:04,996
That's where he scouted for his victims.

591
00:28:05,063 --> 00:28:07,064
Sounds like we should put
an apb out on this guy.

592
00:28:07,132 --> 00:28:08,266
Get some men over to humboldt park,

593
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:09,400
Take a look around for him.

594
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:23,247
Mandy?

595
00:28:23,315 --> 00:28:24,782
How did you know?

596
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,984
Know what?

597
00:28:28,554 --> 00:28:30,888
It was in the hatbox.

598
00:28:30,956 --> 00:28:34,525
He must have been planning to propose.

599
00:28:34,593 --> 00:28:36,594
How does it work?

600
00:28:36,662 --> 00:28:38,229
Is he here, now?

601
00:28:38,297 --> 00:28:40,531
Please.

602
00:28:46,805 --> 00:28:49,907
No, no, I'm sorry, he's not.

603
00:28:49,975 --> 00:28:53,477
I'm sorry for the way that
I treated you yesterday.

604
00:28:53,545 --> 00:28:55,880
I mean, that's really
what I came here to say.

605
00:28:57,816 --> 00:29:00,351
I was hoping he'd be here.

606
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:04,121
Hoping you could tell him about
some decisions I've made.

607
00:29:04,189 --> 00:29:06,357
I can do that.

608
00:29:06,425 --> 00:29:09,961
I've decided to leave phoenix.

609
00:29:10,028 --> 00:29:12,897
It's just-- it's too hard.

610
00:29:12,965 --> 00:29:16,734
I mean, I came here because of jeremy.

611
00:29:16,802 --> 00:29:19,704
And I see him everywhere.
I feel him everywhere.

612
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:22,306
It's wrong to be here without him.

613
00:29:22,374 --> 00:29:26,444
So I have some loose ends to tie up,
house and all.

614
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:29,380
But as soon as I can,
I'm going to head back east

615
00:29:29,448 --> 00:29:31,616
And try living with my mom for a while.

616
00:29:31,683 --> 00:29:34,652
I'm sure that jeremy would understand that.

617
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,256
Yeah.

618
00:29:38,323 --> 00:29:44,061
When you see him-- tell him "thank you."

619
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:48,332
And tell him, thanks to you,
I know what I have to do now.

620
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,402
Tell him that I would have said "yes."

621
00:29:52,437 --> 00:29:55,206
I'm sure he knows that.

622
00:29:55,274 --> 00:29:56,807
But I will let him know.

623
00:29:58,377 --> 00:30:00,845
Come on in.

624
00:30:03,148 --> 00:30:04,915
Nothing to be afraid of.

625
00:30:04,983 --> 00:30:07,385
Just your run-of-th
e-mill performance review.

626
00:30:07,452 --> 00:30:10,254
I'm sure you've been through these before.

627
00:30:10,322 --> 00:30:14,725
It's kind of nice,
your supervisor being here.

628
00:30:14,793 --> 00:30:16,327
Taking a personal interest in your career.

629
00:30:16,395 --> 00:30:20,431
Here we go.

630
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:22,366
Dubois. Joseph.

631
00:30:22,434 --> 00:30:25,303
I have to say, joe, we, uh,
we were all very excited

632
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,904
When you came on board here.

633
00:30:26,972 --> 00:30:29,807
Although, according to this,

634
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:33,277
You've been having some trouble adjusting.

635
00:30:33,345 --> 00:30:36,013
Uh, trouble adjusting?

636
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:38,215
Well, I'm sorry to say,

637
00:30:38,283 --> 00:30:40,351
The evaluations I received
from your supervisor,

638
00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:44,121
Reflect, well, a certain level of
disappointment with your performance.

639
00:30:45,424 --> 00:30:47,358
As you can see, pretty much

640
00:30:47,426 --> 00:30:49,060
Straight down the line,

641
00:30:49,127 --> 00:30:52,129
There are issues with the clarity and focus.

642
00:30:52,197 --> 00:30:53,764
Excuse me?

643
00:30:53,832 --> 00:30:55,933
Well, let's read along here, shall we?

644
00:30:56,001 --> 00:30:59,870
"describe your coworker's
communication skills."

645
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:02,106
And what does it say there?

646
00:31:02,174 --> 00:31:04,475
"diffuse."

647
00:31:04,543 --> 00:31:08,379
"describe your coworker's
ability to problem solve."

648
00:31:08,447 --> 00:31:11,615
"diffuse."

649
00:31:11,683 --> 00:31:13,384
"describe your..."

650
00:31:13,452 --> 00:31:15,219
Well, you get the idea.

651
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:17,288
Yeah, yeah.

652
00:31:17,356 --> 00:31:19,156
I sure do.

653
00:31:44,383 --> 00:31:47,418
Remember that ring?

654
00:31:47,486 --> 00:31:52,523
I took it off the first
girl we ever did together.

655
00:31:55,093 --> 00:31:57,328
You loved it so much.

656
00:31:57,396 --> 00:32:01,098
Kept asking what happened to it.

657
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:02,933
I lied.

658
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:05,202
Said it probably fell off her finger

659
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,872
When I was fighting to get her in the van.

660
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:16,313
I've been saving it for
just the right moment.

661
00:32:16,381 --> 00:32:18,916
Guess I waited too long.

662
00:32:30,028 --> 00:32:32,563
That lady who came by today?

663
00:32:32,631 --> 00:32:33,964
She's the real deal.

664
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:38,102
That's what I need you to know.

665
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:41,839
That's what I need you to understand.

666
00:32:41,907 --> 00:32:44,475
You got to clean up our
mess and get out of town.

667
00:32:50,282 --> 00:32:52,383
Attagirl.

668
00:32:52,451 --> 00:32:54,485
You got work to do.

669
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:10,067
Is it done?

670
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:12,670
Can I go now, please?

671
00:33:12,737 --> 00:33:15,406
I know you haven't had all your fun yet.

672
00:33:15,474 --> 00:33:18,242
Let's be smart, huh?

673
00:33:19,544 --> 00:33:20,945
You know what I'm talking about.

674
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:23,180
You know what you have to do.

675
00:33:23,248 --> 00:33:25,416
Please let me go.

676
00:33:25,484 --> 00:33:26,984
No!

677
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:31,722
You know what you're doing.

678
00:33:37,947 --> 00:33:39,549
Don't waste your time.

679
00:33:40,016 --> 00:33:42,284
You're just going to embarrass yourself.

680
00:33:42,352 --> 00:33:44,019
You can't prove anything.

681
00:33:44,087 --> 00:33:47,990
Oh, by the way, malinowski?

682
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:51,427
The guy I told you murdered all those girls?

683
00:33:51,495 --> 00:33:53,963
He died.

684
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,332
Froze to death in the desert two nights ago.

685
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,467
You might want to mention that
to the people you work for.

686
00:33:58,535 --> 00:34:00,336
You used me.

687
00:34:00,403 --> 00:34:03,405
Oh, I did what I had to do.

688
00:34:03,473 --> 00:34:04,640
How can you do that?

689
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:07,143
How can you just sit there,
so smug, so calm?

690
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,878
We're going to get

691
00:34:08,945 --> 00:34:09,979
Your girlfriend.

692
00:34:10,046 --> 00:34:12,081
We are not going to let her leave town.

693
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:13,349
Sure you will.

694
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:15,718
What can you do?

695
00:34:15,785 --> 00:34:18,187
That basement? It's clean now.

696
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:20,222
There's no trace of anything
that happened down there.

697
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,591
No evidence whatsoever.

698
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:25,561
Oh, yeah. She'll leave town.

699
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:28,430
And sure, you'll keep an eye on her

700
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:30,232
For a while.

701
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,368
Call whatever jurisdiction she ends up in.

702
00:34:32,435 --> 00:34:33,602
Tell them to keep an eye on her.

703
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,539
But time goes by.

704
00:34:36,606 --> 00:34:38,274
There'll be other crimes.

705
00:34:38,341 --> 00:34:40,743
Other murders here in phoenix.

706
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,278
And you'll forget.

707
00:34:42,345 --> 00:34:44,847
That's how these things go.

708
00:34:44,915 --> 00:34:46,282
She'll be fine.

709
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:48,050
As long as she doesn't slip up.

710
00:34:48,118 --> 00:34:49,852
As long as she's patient.

711
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,288
So what? She just stops?

712
00:34:52,355 --> 00:34:53,455
Well...

713
00:34:53,523 --> 00:34:56,358
I didn't say forever.

714
00:34:56,426 --> 00:35:00,095
I mean, when you do the things that we do,

715
00:35:00,163 --> 00:35:04,967
It's a tough itch to
scratch once you've got it.

716
00:35:05,035 --> 00:35:07,903
But, like I said, mandy,

717
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:10,639
She's nothing if not patient, so...

718
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:13,642
She'll wait. Wait for the right time.

719
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,744
The right situation.

720
00:35:15,812 --> 00:35:17,546
A signal from me, maybe.

721
00:35:19,115 --> 00:35:21,517
And I'll be patient, too.

722
00:35:21,585 --> 00:35:22,751
Wait for her.

723
00:35:26,323 --> 00:35:27,856
Ain't love grand?

724
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:38,701
Oh.

725
00:35:38,768 --> 00:35:39,935
Hi, allison.

726
00:35:40,003 --> 00:35:41,470
Hi, I'm so sorry to bother you.

727
00:35:41,538 --> 00:35:44,406
But jeremy came to see me last night.

728
00:35:44,474 --> 00:35:46,775
He said he had one last message.

729
00:35:46,843 --> 00:35:48,310
Well, what did he want you to tell me?

730
00:35:48,378 --> 00:35:52,147
Well, it didn't really make a
lot of sense to me at the time,

731
00:35:52,215 --> 00:35:54,917
I mean, with you getting
ready to leave and all.

732
00:35:54,985 --> 00:35:57,319
But he was terribly concerned

733
00:35:57,387 --> 00:35:59,021
About you going through
all of this by yourself.

734
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:01,657
I mean, getting ready for the funeral,

735
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:04,193
And-and moving back east.

736
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:05,728
He was-he was worried

737
00:36:05,795 --> 00:36:08,163
That you didn't have a friend
to help you through all this.

738
00:36:19,676 --> 00:36:21,310
Jeremy had you take this?

739
00:36:21,378 --> 00:36:22,978
This morning.

740
00:36:23,046 --> 00:36:26,915
He said that he thought the two
of you could make great friends.

741
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:28,984
That she was perfect for you.

742
00:36:31,421 --> 00:36:33,956
I wonder what he was thinking.

743
00:36:34,024 --> 00:36:36,725
He said to tell you tha
t-that she jogs every morning

744
00:36:36,793 --> 00:36:40,596
At walker park at 7:00, 7:00 in the morning.

745
00:36:40,664 --> 00:36:42,564
Um, oh, and he wanted you to know

746
00:36:42,632 --> 00:36:45,868
That if you two do become friends,

747
00:36:45,935 --> 00:36:47,936
That he will be watching,

748
00:36:48,004 --> 00:36:49,271
That he'll see everything,

749
00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:51,440
And that it'll bring him a lot of pleasure

750
00:36:51,508 --> 00:36:54,610
To know that you're not alone.

751
00:36:56,846 --> 00:36:59,415
Keith?

752
00:36:59,482 --> 00:37:02,551
Hey, keith. Can you not hear me over there?

753
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:05,621
Am I being too diffuse?

754
00:37:05,689 --> 00:37:07,756
What are you working on?
Is that company business

755
00:37:07,824 --> 00:37:09,491
Or more of your lord of
the harry potter crap?

756
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:10,826
All right. This is a private office.

757
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:11,994
You can't-you can't just walk--

758
00:37:12,062 --> 00:37:14,897
You owe me an apology.

759
00:37:14,964 --> 00:37:18,100
And I want you to write a
letter to human resources

760
00:37:18,168 --> 00:37:20,202
Saying you didn't mean any of the things

761
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,437
That you wrote in that report.

762
00:37:21,504 --> 00:37:25,407
Oh, but I meant every word of it.

763
00:37:25,475 --> 00:37:28,444
Of course, it's fairly early
on in your employment here.

764
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:30,412
I might modify my opinion in time.

765
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,648
Just like you might modify your opinion

766
00:37:32,716 --> 00:37:34,583
When you finish my manuscript.

767
00:37:34,651 --> 00:37:37,353
When I finish your manuscript?

768
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,787
After what you did to me? No.

769
00:37:38,855 --> 00:37:40,189
Are you out of your mind?

770
00:37:40,256 --> 00:37:42,858
No. I'm not indulging your childish behavior

771
00:37:42,926 --> 00:37:44,193
For one more second.

772
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,761
That's what this is about, isn't it?

773
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:47,463
That-that I'm much younger than you.

774
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,565
Hey, you're not that much younger than me.

775
00:37:49,632 --> 00:37:51,800
No. I'm-I'm a lot younger than you.

776
00:37:51,868 --> 00:37:54,403
Well, you're certainly a lot
more childish than I am.

777
00:37:54,471 --> 00:37:57,005
And I think that your behavior
in that meeting yesterday,

778
00:37:57,073 --> 00:37:58,340
And in fact, your behavior from the second

779
00:37:58,408 --> 00:38:00,142
You gave me that screed of yours...

780
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,377
Screed?

781
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:04,480
You... Punk.

782
00:38:04,547 --> 00:38:07,049
Okay. All right.

783
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:08,484
You're calling me a punk, then?

784
00:38:08,551 --> 00:38:10,686
Yeah, punk, I am.

785
00:38:10,754 --> 00:38:12,087
'cause that is what you did yesterday.

786
00:38:12,155 --> 00:38:13,689
That was a punk move.

787
00:38:13,757 --> 00:38:15,758
That was not something
that an adult would do.

788
00:38:15,825 --> 00:38:17,793
That is not something that a man would do.

789
00:38:17,861 --> 00:38:19,495
Oh. So now I'm not a man?

790
00:38:19,562 --> 00:38:20,963
I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question?

791
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,798
'cause I was busy trying to
remember what decade it was

792
00:38:22,866 --> 00:38:26,168
That I last had a chocolate
milk and pb and j for lunch.

793
00:38:26,236 --> 00:38:28,937
All right. That's it, dubois.

794
00:38:29,005 --> 00:38:30,172
You want a piece of me?

795
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,974
Careful what you wish for, punk.

796
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:33,776
Come on. We'll settle this old school.

797
00:38:33,843 --> 00:38:34,810
Like men?

798
00:38:34,878 --> 00:38:37,679
Yeah, like real men.

799
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:40,716
I got that!

800
00:38:40,784 --> 00:38:42,317
Ha! Shoot him!

801
00:38:42,385 --> 00:38:43,552
Take that, punk.

802
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,020
Die, old man!

803
00:38:45,088 --> 00:38:47,256
Are you guys ever gonna finish?

804
00:38:47,323 --> 00:38:49,758
We've been waiting here an hour.

805
00:38:49,826 --> 00:38:53,262
Hey. Didn't your parents teach
you to respect your elders?

806
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:54,630
Go away.

807
00:38:54,697 --> 00:38:57,099
Scat. This is serious.

808
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:58,434
Come on.

809
00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:04,339
You all think that you're
winning here today.

810
00:39:04,407 --> 00:39:06,708
You think that you're punishing me.

811
00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:10,746
You don't know the way things really work.

812
00:39:10,814 --> 00:39:13,649
I am going to go see jeremy today.

813
00:39:13,716 --> 00:39:15,784
And that is a reward.

814
00:39:15,852 --> 00:39:18,821
And we're gonna laugh.

815
00:39:18,888 --> 00:39:21,457
At all of you.

816
00:39:21,524 --> 00:39:23,192
At all of this.

817
00:39:23,259 --> 00:39:25,160
Everything.

818
00:40:00,897 --> 00:40:02,898
It's done.

819
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,976
You tried to abduct an undercover cop.

820
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:18,180
Oh, my god!

821
00:40:18,248 --> 00:40:20,115
Jeremy!

822
00:40:20,183 --> 00:40:21,750
It's really you!

823
00:40:21,818 --> 00:40:23,619
Yeah. It's really me.

824
00:40:23,686 --> 00:40:26,188
I've been waiting so long to see you.

825
00:40:26,256 --> 00:40:29,858
Well, actually, no, you haven't.

826
00:40:29,926 --> 00:40:33,662
I mean, really, mandy.

827
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:34,763
I thought we could have

828
00:40:34,831 --> 00:40:36,498
Stretched this thing out a little bit.

829
00:40:36,566 --> 00:40:38,967
I didn't think it was going
to end quite so fast.

830
00:40:39,035 --> 00:40:41,370
Are you disappointed?

831
00:40:41,437 --> 00:40:45,107
Well, yeah. A little bit.

832
00:40:45,174 --> 00:40:49,111
I mean, you did try to
abduct an undercover cop.

833
00:40:49,178 --> 00:40:51,513
When did you get so stupid?

834
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:53,415
Hmm?

835
00:40:53,483 --> 00:40:54,716
Seriously, what happened?

836
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,252
Did you become a total idiot after I died?

837
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,055
That woman, she said she
had a message from you.

838
00:41:00,123 --> 00:41:01,156
Yeah, she lied.

839
00:41:01,224 --> 00:41:02,558
It was a trick.

840
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:04,893
I can't believe you didn't
know it was a trick.

841
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:08,564
I'm sorry, okay? I wanted to believe it.

842
00:41:08,631 --> 00:41:10,699
I wanted to believe that
you would be watching

843
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:12,568
One last time.

844
00:41:12,635 --> 00:41:14,069
Jeremy, why are you mad?

845
00:41:14,137 --> 00:41:16,471
We're together now and we'll stay together.

846
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:18,006
Forever. Yeah?

847
00:41:18,074 --> 00:41:20,175
And what are we gonna do forever, mandy?

848
00:41:20,243 --> 00:41:22,177
We're gonna stare at each other?

849
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:23,612
Talk?

850
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,114
I thought you liked talking to me.

851
00:41:26,182 --> 00:41:27,616
I thought we were perfect together.

852
00:41:27,684 --> 00:41:30,152
There was one thing that made
us perfect for each other.

853
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:33,322
And now, thanks to you,
that one thing is gone.

854
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:37,259
Thanks to me? Mm-hmm.

855
00:41:37,327 --> 00:41:38,827
I didn't get hit by a car

856
00:41:38,895 --> 00:41:41,029
Because I never learned
to leave my dope at home.

857
00:41:41,097 --> 00:41:43,765
Couldn't leave it at home,
'cause, as you and I both know,

858
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:45,167
It wouldn't be there when I get back.

859
00:41:45,234 --> 00:41:47,936
One time! One time I smoked
without you. Get over it!

860
00:41:48,004 --> 00:41:49,338
Get over yourself.

861
00:41:49,405 --> 00:41:51,406
You think I don't know you
also go through my wallet?

862
00:41:51,474 --> 00:41:53,375
Check my email, look through my cell phone?

863
00:41:53,443 --> 00:41:54,643
That's 'cause you go through mine.

864
00:41:54,711 --> 00:41:56,011
I do not! You do, too.

865
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,245
Do not. You lie!

866
00:41:57,313 --> 00:41:58,547
Who you calling a liar?

867
00:41:58,615 --> 00:42:00,515
You, liar! Yeah? At least I'm not an idiot.

868
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:02,684
Oh, shut your face! At least I don't have--

869
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,124
Oh, sorry.

870
00:42:09,192 --> 00:42:11,860
Oh, no. It's okay. I was awake already.

871
00:42:11,928 --> 00:42:13,261
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

872
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:14,963
Did you have a bad dream?

873
00:42:15,031 --> 00:42:17,733
No, I had a good dream, actually.

874
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,402
Yeah. Yeah. I think
everything's going to work out.

875
00:42:22,071 --> 00:42:24,172
The perfect ending

876
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,642
To a perfect relationship.

877
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:31,246
Hey. Speaking of relationships,

878
00:42:31,314 --> 00:42:32,648
How did it go?

879
00:42:32,715 --> 00:42:34,816
Who's the new "king of kong"?

880
00:42:34,884 --> 00:42:38,720
Who beat who? Come on.
Inquiring minds want to know.

881
00:42:38,788 --> 00:42:41,023
I don't know. I let him win a couple.

882
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,758
Then he let me win a couple.

883
00:42:42,825 --> 00:42:45,694
And then we-we drank a bunch.

884
00:42:45,762 --> 00:42:48,296
And then we ordered some food and we talked.

885
00:42:48,364 --> 00:42:49,931
And then we drank some more.

886
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:51,500
That's it?

887
00:42:51,567 --> 00:42:53,669
Uh-huh. No, actually.

888
00:42:53,736 --> 00:42:56,338
Uh, it turns out, he can belch on command.

889
00:42:56,406 --> 00:42:57,806
Hmm.

890
00:42:57,874 --> 00:43:00,709
It's very impressive.
Uh, he likes the thing I do

891
00:43:00,777 --> 00:43:02,577
Where the smoke comes out of my ear.

892
00:43:02,645 --> 00:43:06,048
It sounds like love. Yeah.

893
00:43:06,115 --> 00:43:08,917
So, no more animus? No more, uh, anger?

894
00:43:08,985 --> 00:43:11,987
No more, "my wee-wee's bigger
than your wee-wee" stuff?
