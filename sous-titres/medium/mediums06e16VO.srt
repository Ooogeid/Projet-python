1
00:00:01,916 --> 00:00:02,916
Where is this?

2
00:00:03,016 --> 00:00:04,684
This place where you
and Mommy got married?

3
00:00:04,718 --> 00:00:08,187
It's in California.

4
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:10,222
A ace called San Luis Obispo.

5
00:00:10,256 --> 00:00:12,657
But you and Mommy lived
here in Phoenix, right?

6
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:15,660
Why'd you have to go all the way
out there to get married?

7
00:00:15,694 --> 00:00:17,695
Uh, I don't know.

8
00:00:17,729 --> 00:00:19,896
It was just... it was just
kind of a compromise.

9
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:22,275
Your mom wanted
a little wedding here.

10
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,641
Grandma and Grandpa Dubois
wanted big wedding

11
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:27,563
in Grosse Pointe,
overlooking the lake,

12
00:00:27,598 --> 00:00:32,057
so we ended up in California,
overlooking the ocean.

13
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:34,263
You sure you really want
to put all these pictures

14
00:00:34,298 --> 00:00:36,335
of you and Mommy away?

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,122
I mean, what happens
when she comes back?

16
00:00:39,156 --> 00:00:42,199
Won't it hurt her feelings when
she sees that they're all gone?

17
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:43,346
Come on, Bridge.

18
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,069
Your mom hasn't been here
in forever.

19
00:00:45,104 --> 00:00:47,259
I know you don't want
hear it,

20
00:00:47,294 --> 00:00:48,948
but I don't think
she's coming back.

21
00:00:56,552 --> 00:00:57,735
Yeah?

22
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,487
You okay?

23
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:03,886
No... no, I don't know.

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,202
I don't knowif it's t.

25
00:01:06,236 --> 00:01:09,625
or not being able to drink, but
I just had the strangest dream.

26
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,439
Was there any sex in it?

27
00:01:14,327 --> 00:01:16,673
No.

28
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:19,059
No, it was sad.

29
00:01:19,094 --> 00:01:23,084
We were married
and we had this little girl.

30
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,770
Well, I guess I left you--
I left both of you.

31
00:01:26,804 --> 00:01:29,620
You still want to be
Mrs. Joe Dubois though, right?

32
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:32,436
I mean, I'd hate to think we
brought all these people here

33
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:34,781
to California just to senf them home

34
00:01:34,815 --> 00:01:36,057
without even having
a wedding.

35
00:01:36,736 --> 00:01:38,836
Well that'll never happen.

36
00:01:39,174 --> 00:01:41,016
It was just a dream.pen.

39
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:33,101
Hi.

40
00:02:36,484 --> 00:02:38,004
You okay in there?

41
00:02:38,418 --> 00:02:39,538
I'm fabulous.

42
00:02:41,754 --> 00:02:43,574
Your mom and dad get in alright?

43
00:02:43,835 --> 00:02:45,435
Yeah. My dad's
already complained

44
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:48,337
about the plane ride,
the car rental, anhis room.

45
00:02:48,372 --> 00:02:50,607
My mom's already been
down to the bakery

46
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:54,046
to make sure that our cake
is made to her specifications.

47
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,613
yeah, I'd say
they're fine.

48
00:02:55,648 --> 00:02:56,915
Same as always.

49
00:02:56,949 --> 00:03:00,151
Hey, you wanted me to remind you
to reconfirm the deejay.

50
00:03:00,185 --> 00:03:01,352
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

51
00:03:01,386 --> 00:03:02,786
I got to get presents
for the groomsmen.

52
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,421
I have to make sure
that the welcome baskets

53
00:03:04,455 --> 00:03:06,689
are ready for the rest of
the guests when they check in.

54
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:08,658
Are you sure you just don't want
to meet them now

55
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:09,693
and get it over with?

56
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:12,529
You know, if you had told me

57
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:14,997
that I actually d to meet your
parents in order to marry you,

58
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:18,634
I might not have accepted
your proposal.

59
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:20,603
Hmm? What are you
so nervous about?

60
00:03:20,638 --> 00:03:21,904
They're gonna love you.

61
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:23,372
How can you be so sure?

62
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:26,909
Because I love you, so they
don't really have a choice.

63
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:28,710
Come on. What do you say?

64
00:03:28,744 --> 00:03:31,012
Mm, your mouth tastes
all fresh and minty.

65
00:03:31,046 --> 00:03:33,381
Hmm? Come on, let's
just go down the hall

66
00:03:33,415 --> 00:03:34,448
and get it over with.

67
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:37,484
Hi. Hi, my name's Allison.

68
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,152
I'm going to marry your boy.

69
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:41,487
Oh, and by the way,
I'm pregnant.

70
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:44,021
Nice to meet you.

71
00:03:44,055 --> 00:03:46,023
Don't be such a smartass.

72
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:48,391
I thought you decided that we
weren't going to say anything

73
00:03:48,426 --> 00:03:50,628
about the baby until you hit
the three-month mark.

74
00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:53,699
Yeah, I did, and I won't.

75
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,300
Six or seven weeks
is plenty of time

76
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,169
to tell people the good news.

77
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,504
And tonight at dinner is my time
to meet your parents.

78
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,606
The maid?

79
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,041
The maid of honor.

80
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:08,879
I'm coming, Kim.

81
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:10,947
I have the list
of what we ordered

82
00:04:10,982 --> 00:04:12,549
for the rehearsal dinner
torrow night,

83
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,751
but do you have the receipt
for the actual ceremony?

84
00:04:14,785 --> 00:04:16,552
I think so.

85
00:04:16,587 --> 00:04:18,654
I'm sorry.
Who's next?

86
00:04:18,688 --> 00:04:20,522
Can I help you?
Uh, I hope so.

87
00:04:20,556 --> 00:04:24,125
I was wondering: would you mind
putting up one of these flyers?

88
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:25,693
That's my daughter Julie.

89
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,361
She hasn't been home
in two days.

90
00:04:27,395 --> 00:04:28,928
She drove off in her
little blue car

91
00:04:28,963 --> 00:04:30,396
and no one has
seen her since.

92
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,730
Would you mind if I...

93
00:04:31,764 --> 00:04:33,364
if I put up
one of these?
Sure.

94
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,365
Thank you.

95
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,433
Excuse me.

96
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:38,203
Can I help you?

97
00:05:01,656 --> 00:05:03,990
Hi, I'm Kim Clement,
and this is Allison Rolen.

98
00:05:04,024 --> 00:05:06,592
And we're here toheck
on some things

99
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:09,427
for the Dubois wedding
in two days.

100
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:12,763
There we go.

101
00:05:12,797 --> 00:05:14,398
And what can I do you
for, young lady?

102
00:05:14,432 --> 00:05:16,399
Red... Oh, you want white wine?

103
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:18,034
Maybe a little rosÃ©?

104
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,870
I'm fine just
with water. Thank you.

105
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:22,305
Well, don't hold back
on our account.

106
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:24,708
I'm in the auto business,
young lady.

107
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:26,009
We live by the maxim

108
00:05:26,043 --> 00:05:27,643
"Everything runs smoother
with a little lubrication."

109
00:05:27,678 --> 00:05:29,045
Dad, Dad, Dad,

110
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,813
she just doesn't
feel like it.

111
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:33,715
Stop trying to pour wine
down the poor girl's throat.

112
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,950
All right, fine, fine.

113
00:05:35,984 --> 00:05:37,986
It's how I won you, darling.

114
00:05:41,455 --> 00:05:43,289
So, Allison, we were
very disappointed to hear

115
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:44,990
that your family
won't be joining us.

116
00:05:45,024 --> 00:05:47,525
Oh, I know. I'm sorry, too.

117
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:49,561
My mom and I...

118
00:05:51,397 --> 00:05:52,664
But it's fine.

119
00:05:52,698 --> 00:05:55,333
I sure at at some point
we'll all get to meet.

120
00:05:58,235 --> 00:06:01,804
This town is lovely.

121
00:06:01,838 --> 00:06:03,904
And the inn--

122
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:05,840
it's so charming.

123
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,609
"Charming." Code
for "old," right?

124
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:11,945
I tell you, I tried to have
a shower when I got in here--

125
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:14,080
the water pressure died
in about two minutes.

126
00:06:14,114 --> 00:06:16,649
The water pressure
in my room is just fine.

127
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:20,151
You guys are in separate rooms?

128
00:06:20,186 --> 00:06:23,254
Well, we had to book this place
on such short notice, kiddo,

129
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:26,156
and they didn't have
any king bs left, so...

130
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,191
Yeah, two rooms.
It helps keep the peace.

131
00:06:29,226 --> 00:06:31,393
We'll live.

132
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:38,599
So, um, my son tells me
that you're in law school.

133
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:42,502
Uh, yeah, actually I go
to the School of Justice.

134
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,170
It's kind of pre-law.

135
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,238
Oh.

136
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:46,639
Now how does that work?

137
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,840
I mean, if you want
to have babies someday?

138
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,943
I mean, to be a lawyer,
but then have babies--

139
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,545
does that really make sense?

140
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,846
Mom...
Hey, Marjori

141
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,715
well, I mean,
don't you think...

142
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:15,529
...it's what
good mothers do.

143
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:18,498
Excuse me. I'm going to have
to excuse myself just a moment.

144
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:19,866
You all right?

145
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:21,267
Yeah, I'm fine.

146
00:07:21,302 --> 00:07:23,169
I'll be right back.

147
00:07:25,538 --> 00:07:27,139
What are you doing?

148
00:07:57,632 --> 00:07:59,533
They love you, by the way.

149
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:01,134
When you were in the bathroom,

150
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:02,869
they pretty much told me
they love you.

151
00:08:02,903 --> 00:08:04,704
The lawyer thing threw
my mother  first,

152
00:08:04,738 --> 00:08:07,540
but now that she met you,
she gets it.

153
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:09,175
I had to lie

154
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:12,777
and tell them that kids weren't
even on the menu for right now.

155
00:08:12,812 --> 00:08:14,045
I started to worry

156
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,581
that maybe they
suspected something

157
00:08:16,615 --> 00:08:20,518
when you didn't want a drink,
but I think we got away with it.

158
00:08:20,553 --> 00:08:24,089
I could really use a drink
right about now.

159
00:08:24,123 --> 00:08:29,693
Oh, I understand.
I understand.

160
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:31,362
I don't know how you did it.

161
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:33,831
I don't know how you got
through that dinner sober.

162
00:08:33,865 --> 00:08:35,165
I had half a bottle of wine,

163
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,734
and it was all I could do
to keep my ass in the seat

164
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:39,169
and not run down
the nearest courthouse

165
00:08:39,203 --> 00:08:43,040
and change my name and
put myself up for adoption.

166
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:45,108
Hey, hey, Mr. Science Guy,

167
00:08:45,143 --> 00:08:47,611
how much do you know
about hormones?

168
00:08:47,645 --> 00:08:49,113
Exse me?

169
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:52,482
Well, it's not just
my dreams now.

170
00:08:52,516 --> 00:08:57,186
I'seeing things, hearing
things, even when I'm awake.

171
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,522
What? What kind of things?

172
00:09:00,557 --> 00:09:03,192
Well, when I went
to the flower shop today,

173
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:04,860
this woman came in.

174
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:06,428
Her daughter was missing.

175
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,430
She wanted to put
her picture up.

176
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:13,902
And I saw her-- the daughter
right there, right then,

177
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:15,370
being strangled to death.

178
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:18,139
You saw her strangled
in the flower shop?

179
00:09:18,173 --> 00:09:20,107
No.

180
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,143
It was in my head.

181
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:25,646
It happened someplace else,
but...

182
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,048
It was so vivid.
It was so specific.

183
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,717
It was like...
like a little movie.

184
00:09:30,752 --> 00:09:32,419
What can that be?

185
00:09:33,254 --> 00:09:35,589
Empathy?

186
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:37,991
Yeah, well, I saw her
again tonight--

187
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:40,927
at the restaurant.

188
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:44,630
Naked, dead,
in the bathroom mirror.

189
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:47,166
Okay, I had the fish.
What did you have?

190
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,101
I don't think
it was what I ate.

191
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:51,370
Okay, maybe i's
something in the water.

192
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:53,839
My parents are sleeping
in separate rooms.

193
00:09:53,873 --> 00:09:57,075
Something in the water
would explain a lot.

194
00:09:57,109 --> 00:09:59,744
That really hiyou,
didn't it?

195
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:01,379
Well, yes and no.

196
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:03,815
I meanI'm not a kid
living at home.

197
00:10:03,849 --> 00:10:06,384
And I know things haven't always
been great between them,

198
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:09,320
but finding out
they're in different rooms

199
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:12,056
two nights before
I get married...

200
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,792
It kind of makes me sad.

201
00:10:14,826 --> 00:10:18,629
Oh, baby, let's fool around.

202
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:33,109
Hi.

203
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:35,344
Are you... are you looking
for my dad?

204
00:10:35,378 --> 00:10:38,112
Yeah. We're going to go
grab some dinner.

205
00:10:38,147 --> 00:10:41,048
Um...
Is he not here?

206
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:43,283
Actually, no.

207
00:10:43,318 --> 00:10:46,119
He-he must have forgotten.
He went out to the movies.

208
00:10:46,153 --> 00:10:48,120
Do you want me
to try and call him?

209
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:50,088
No, no, no, that's okay.

210
00:10:50,123 --> 00:10:52,224
I guess I'm lucky yo
came home when you did.

211
00:10:52,258 --> 00:10:54,959
Otherwise I'd be sting out
on the curb all night.

212
00:10:56,327 --> 00:10:58,795
It's been such a long time
since I've seen you.

213
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,464
You're changing so much.

214
00:11:01,498 --> 00:11:04,033
Actually, I think I saw you,
like, four months ago.

215
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:08,770
Well, even so, every time
I me visit,

216
00:11:08,804 --> 00:11:12,607
seems like you're even more
beautiful than the time before.

217
00:11:12,642 --> 00:11:15,943
Uh, thanks.

218
00:11:15,977 --> 00:11:18,311
You know, I've got
a little homework to do,

219
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,245
so I, uh, I bett get inside.

220
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,445
It was nice seeing you.

221
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,980
So that's it?

222
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:24,514
I drove all the way over here.

223
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:26,950
You're not gonna even offer
me a glass of water?

224
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:31,753
Actually, you know what?

225
00:11:31,788 --> 00:11:33,621
Don't worry. Forget the water.

226
00:11:33,656 --> 00:11:35,656
I don't need
to come inside.

227
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,224
Not really.

228
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:39,326
I could just take you with me.

229
00:11:48,936 --> 00:11:51,470
You okay?

230
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:53,471
Is everything all right?

231
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:54,938
Yeah. No.

232
00:11:54,972 --> 00:11:57,139
No, I had another dream.

233
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,140
A bad dream.

234
00:11:58,174 --> 00:11:59,540
A really bad dream.

235
00:11:59,574 --> 00:12:00,941
Did you leave me again?

236
00:12:00,975 --> 00:12:02,175
No, you weren't there.

237
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:03,142
It was a girl.

238
00:12:03,177 --> 00:12:05,344
The girl from town?

239
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:06,445
The one who's missing?

240
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,780
No, no, not her.

241
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:10,615
Another girl, a teenage girl.

242
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:12,417
A girl I've never seen before.

243
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:14,218
Well, then come on.

244
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:15,586
That was just a nightmare.

245
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,820
Come on.

246
00:12:16,854 --> 00:12:18,887
Come on.
Let's go back to sleep.

247
00:12:18,922 --> 00:12:20,222
You just made her up.

248
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:23,823
She's no one.

249
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:25,456
Mmm...

250
00:12:34,326 --> 00:12:36,646
He went to play golf
with his father.

251
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:40,739
Grandma Benoit.

252
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:52,798
Stop looking so amazed.

253
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:56,500
You've been seeing the dead
since you were six.

254
00:12:56,535 --> 00:13:01,138
, Grandma, when I was a little
girl, I had a very active...

255
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:03,410
"...active imagination."

256
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:06,084
I heard your mother
when she told you that,

257
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,725
and I bit my tongue.

258
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:13,807
You can ignore the ghosts
all you want.

259
00:13:13,808 --> 00:13:16,780
You can drink yourself

260
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:19,587
You can igto the placests
where you can't see or hear,

261
00:13:19,621 --> 00:13:21,955
but that doesn't change the fact

262
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:23,890
that they're reaching out
to you.

263
00:13:25,392 --> 00:13:29,629
You're seeing me now,
but that daren't you?ge the fact

264
00:13:29,663 --> 00:13:31,632
And I've been gone a long time.

265
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,168
But this is a dream, Grandma.

266
00:13:34,202 --> 00:13:36,303
It's a nice dream...

267
00:13:36,337 --> 00:13:37,804
but it's dream.

268
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,842
It's not a dream, and neither
was that girl you saw yesterday.

269
00:13:42,876 --> 00:13:46,713
She's de, Allison,
and no one knows.

270
00:13:46,747 --> 00:13:48,114
No one but you.

271
00:13:48,148 --> 00:13:50,783
And you're getting ready

272
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:53,618
to have a child of your own.

273
00:13:53,653 --> 00:13:54,853
You think about it.

274
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:58,422
One day you wake up
anthe child's gone.

275
00:13:58,456 --> 00:14:02,025
Someone knows what's happened,

276
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,096
but they can't be bothered
to say anything,

277
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,465
pick up the phone,
tell the police what they know.

278
00:14:09,168 --> 00:14:15,872
There's a reason
you see these things, Allison.

279
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:22,111
Yeah.

280
00:14:22,145 --> 00:14:24,780
You ever considered
a prenuptial agreement?

281
00:14:24,814 --> 00:14:26,348
What?!

282
00:14:26,382 --> 00:14:29,017
No! Never.

283
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:30,484
Well, maybe you should.

284
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:34,621
Dad, I own two-thirds
of a used car.

285
00:14:34,655 --> 00:14:36,789
That's really not much
to fight over.

286
00:14:36,824 --> 00:14:39,458
Well, you don't have
that much now,

287
00:14:39,492 --> 00:14:40,726
but you're gonna
have more someday,

288
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,060
and you need
to plan accordingly.

289
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:43,294
Dad, come on.

290
00:14:43,328 --> 00:14:44,528
This is crazy.

291
00:14:44,563 --> 00:14:46,964
Allison and I don't have
that kind of relationship.

292
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:47,865
Of course you don't.

293
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,233
Nobody has that kind
of relationship

294
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:50,367
when they start off.

295
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:52,335
But after you've been
together for a while

296
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,304
and saved up
some real scratch,

297
00:14:54,338 --> 00:14:56,339
who kns what kind of
relationship you'll have?

298
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:58,574
You sure as hell can't
draw up a prenup then.

299
00:14:58,608 --> 00:15:01,010
Wow, you're quite the romantic,
aren't you?

300
00:15:01,044 --> 00:15:03,212
Look, I'm not saying
she's not a lovely girl,

301
00:15:03,246 --> 00:15:04,279
I'm not saying

302
00:15:04,313 --> 00:15:05,547
you're not gonna be
happy together,

303
00:15:05,581 --> 00:15:06,915
but you need
to be prepared.

304
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,215
Oh, God.

305
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,551
And once you say, "I do," '.

306
00:15:10,585 --> 00:15:11,785
Well, look at me.

307
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:14,554
If I winup
in divorce court,

308
00:15:14,588 --> 00:15:16,956
your mother's gonna get half
of everything I got.

309
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,223
What are you talking about?!

310
00:15:18,258 --> 00:15:19,791
Nobody's ending up
in divorce court:

311
00:15:19,826 --> 00:15:21,359
not you, not me.

312
00:15:21,394 --> 00:15:22,961
I don't like
this conversation.

313
00:15:22,995 --> 00:15:24,595
I'm getting married
tomorrow.

314
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,363
I want you
to wish me luck.

315
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:29,266
FineI wish you luck.

316
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,334
And take it
from someone who knows,

317
00:15:31,368 --> 00:15:32,468
you're gonna need it.

318
00:15:32,503 --> 00:15:33,569
Oh, Dad, you know what?

319
00:15:33,604 --> 00:15:36,038
I love you,
but you're a jackass.

320
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:37,506
Why is that?

321
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,175
Because I'm trying to give you
the benefit of my experience?

322
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:42,110
I have stood
where you're standing.

323
00:15:42,144 --> 00:15:44,012
The view is deceptive.

324
00:15:44,046 --> 00:15:45,146
It doesn't hold up.

325
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,647
Really? And how
would you know that?

326
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:48,048
You come tmy wedding,

327
00:15:48,082 --> 00:15:49,649
and you and Mom
get separate rooms.

328
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:50,783
I mean, what is that?

329
00:15:50,818 --> 00:15:55,388
Oh, for crying out loud,
Joe, wise up, will you?

330
00:15:55,423 --> 00:15:58,491
We goteparate rooms
because we lead separate lives.

331
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:03,428
I've been out of the house
for about three months.

332
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,097
Your mom didn't want
to tell you

333
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,232
till after
the wedding.

334
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,533
And you got to promise
not to let on.

335
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:12,769
What? What happened?

336
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:14,871
Nothing happened.

337
00:16:15,286 --> 00:16:16,406
Marriage happened.

338
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:19,608
Come on. Let's play.d.

339
00:16:19,643 --> 00:16:22,377
You know what?
I don't...

340
00:16:22,412 --> 00:16:24,178
I don't feel like playing.

341
00:16:24,213 --> 00:16:26,983
Oh, wait a minute.

342
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:30,486
Oh, don't do that. Joe!

343
00:16:47,902 --> 00:16:48,935
I'm sorry.

344
00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:51,070
I gotta get in there.
It's my room.

345
00:16:51,104 --> 00:16:52,805
I'm sorry.
There's a detective in there

346
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:53,806
conducting an interview.

347
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,574
An interview?

348
00:16:57,376 --> 00:17:00,078
Thanks for your time,dy in there
Miss Rolen.      but my fiancÃ©e.

349
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,818
Hi.

350
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:17,628
I called the police.

351
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,464
Yeah, I figured somebody did.

352
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:25,168
I didn't know they were gna
come over here.

353
00:17:25,202 --> 00:17:27,837
I told them that I knew
that girl was dead.

354
00:17:27,871 --> 00:17:28,938
The one from town?

355
00:17:28,972 --> 00:17:30,639
e one that you said
you saw last night?

356
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:33,741
I just kept thinking
about her mother,

357
00:17:33,775 --> 00:17:36,176
about her not knowing.

358
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,111
u don't actually
know anything.

359
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:40,645
It's not like, you know,
you-you really saw something.

360
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,880
I saw her being strangled.

361
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:44,048
Yeah, in your head.

362
00:17:44,082 --> 00:17:45,482
That's not the same
as really seeing.

363
00:17:45,517 --> 00:17:48,918
Yeah, that's what
that detective kept saying.

364
00:17:48,953 --> 00:17:51,153
I-I don't understand.

365
00:17:51,188 --> 00:17:54,623
Wha-what was it that
you were hoping to accomplish

366
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:55,791
by calling the police?

367
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:04,532
Grandma Benoit... told me

368
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:06,900
that I was seeing these things
for a reason.

369
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:11,304
Grandma Benoit?

370
00:18:11,338 --> 00:18:14,339
But didn't you say that
she-she died years ago?

371
00:18:21,212 --> 00:18:24,314
Are you having second thoughts
about this marriage?

372
00:18:24,348 --> 00:18:28,184
Have you been...
have you been talking to my dad?

373
00:18:28,219 --> 00:18:30,687
Your dad doesn't think
you should marry me either?

374
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:33,222
Well, my dad doesn't think
anyone should marry anyone.

375
00:18:33,257 --> 00:18:36,725
Turns out he and my mom
have been separated for months.

376
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:39,160
He didn't want to tell anyone.

377
00:18:39,195 --> 00:18:40,995
He didn't... he didn't want
to ruin the wedding.

378
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:44,197
Oh, smart, but he told you.

379
00:18:48,868 --> 00:18:52,970
It's gotta be hard
to be Joe Dubois today, huh?

380
00:18:53,005 --> 00:18:54,739
You have no idea.

381
00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:59,243
Hey, don't forget.

382
00:18:59,278 --> 00:19:01,479
Tonight, after
the rehearsal dinner,

383
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:04,615
you gotta move out
'cause the bride sleeps alone.

384
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,451
That's a barbaric
tradition.

385
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:13,124
We can do anything we want
before the rehearsal dinner.

386
00:19:13,158 --> 00:19:14,659
That's five whole hours.

387
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:17,528
Now that's a very enlightened
tradition.

388
00:19:17,562 --> 00:19:19,463
That's a tradition
I can get behind.

389
00:19:19,497 --> 00:19:20,531
Mmm.

390
00:19:20,565 --> 00:19:23,500
And in answer to yr
earlier question:

391
00:19:23,534 --> 00:19:25,902
yes, I'm leaning
towards going ahead

392
00:19:25,937 --> 00:19:27,237
with the wedding.

393
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:28,739
Ah, you're leaning?

394
00:19:28,773 --> 00:19:30,474
Yeah, it's looking good.

395
00:19:31,743 --> 00:19:34,177
Shut up and take
your clothes off.

396
00:19:44,655 --> 00:19:46,923
Good morning.

397
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:49,693
You probably have
a bit of a headache.

398
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:52,662
And I'm sure
your throat is pretty sore

399
00:19:52,697 --> 00:19:57,300
from all the screaming
you did last night.

400
00:20:03,407 --> 00:20:05,308
Where am I?

401
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:07,076
You've turned into

402
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:09,879
a really beautiful
young woman.

403
00:20:09,913 --> 00:20:12,948
And watching you grow up
has been one

404
00:20:12,982 --> 00:20:14,716
of the great joys
in my life.

405
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,020
Can we talk
about this neck?

406
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:21,690
I mean, how long
and slender it is?

407
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,528
What are you doing?!

408
00:20:26,562 --> 00:20:28,396
Relax.

409
00:20:28,431 --> 00:20:31,766
You're gonna enjoy this.

410
00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:43,710
Uh!
Whoa!

411
00:20:43,745 --> 00:20:45,445
What the hell's
ing on?

412
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:47,447
You okay, huh?

413
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:49,182
Babe, you okay?

414
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:50,216
Yeah, I'm fine.

415
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,784
We're fine.

416
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:53,552
Just a bad dam.

417
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,220
Just another bad dream.

418
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,189
This man I'd never seen before
was doing this horrible thing

419
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:01,291
to this girl
I'd never seen before.

420
00:21:01,325 --> 00:21:03,191
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

421
00:21:03,226 --> 00:21:04,993
Oh, God, it's okay.

422
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:06,126
We gotta get up.

423
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,895
The rehearsal dinner starts
in, li, an hour.

424
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:10,563
Is this thing on?

425
00:21:10,597 --> 00:21:13,431
I'd like to start off

426
00:21:13,466 --> 00:21:17,298
by welcoming all the out-of-town
guests tonight.

427
00:21:17,332 --> 00:21:19,532
And I guess that's everybody,
right?

428
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,095
Well, truthfully, I don't know
my future daughter-in-law

429
00:21:26,128 --> 00:21:28,393
very well... yet,

430
00:21:28,428 --> 00:21:30,393
but I'd like to think
I know my boy,

431
00:21:30,427 --> 00:21:31,961
and I can tell you ts:

432
00:21:31,995 --> 00:21:37,829
he is absolutely <i>crazy</i>
about the girl.

433
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,829
Whoo!
Whoo!

434
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:41,964
Yeah!
Whoo!

435
00:21:41,998 --> 00:21:44,032
My Joey loves you, young lady.

436
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:45,731
Which means that even though

437
00:21:45,765 --> 00:21:48,998
we haven't spent much time
together yet,

438
00:21:49,032 --> 00:21:51,366
we're family.

439
00:21:53,703 --> 00:21:56,570
So, can somebody
get this microphone

440
00:21:56,605 --> 00:21:58,605
out of my hands?

441
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:01,507
Who wants to say something?

442
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:05,711
All right, I guess
I'll keep him.
You, yeah, you.

443
00:22:05,745 --> 00:22:08,647
Come on up. You say something.
Here we go.

444
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:10,081
Yeah, Andy.

445
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:12,516
Okay, wow.

446
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:15,119
I hadn't really planned
on saying anything.

447
00:22:15,154 --> 00:22:19,289
So, Joe, Allison...

448
00:22:19,324 --> 00:22:22,458
I guess your first question
is probly...

449
00:22:22,493 --> 00:22:24,193
who am I?

450
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:28,229
Joe, the last time you saw me,

451
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,731
I think we were playing
Chewbacca and Han Solo

452
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,032
in my folks' basement.

453
00:22:33,901 --> 00:22:37,270
I'm your second cousin,
Andy Seward.

454
00:22:37,304 --> 00:22:39,405
I mean, second cousin
by marriage.

455
00:22:42,376 --> 00:22:44,410
And really, what's
a rehearsal dinner

456
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:46,645
without some remarks
from a second cousin

457
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,714
by marriage, right?

458
00:22:51,138 --> 00:22:52,405
So wait a second.

459
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:54,607
You're telling me
my cousin Andy is a murderer?

460
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:55,607
He's the man I've been
seeing in my dreams, yes.

461
00:22:55,642 --> 00:22:56,642
I'm trying to tell you.

462
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:57,709
I'm sorry. That is what
I'm trying to tell you.

463
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:58,777
He's the man I've been
seeing in my dreams, yes.

464
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:01,545
He's the manYou'e been
rey medelir?So wait a second.

465
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,613
You're telling me
my cousin Andy is a murderer?

466
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,647
He's the man I've been
seeing in my dreams, yes.

467
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,581
I'm sorry. That is what
I'm trying to tell you.

468
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:05,349
What I wouldn't do
for a cigarette or a drink

469
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:07,551
or a d'rmakes no sense.

470
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:09,787
I can't do anything about that.

471
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,621
That's him.

472
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:14,623
I mean, in my dreams
he looks older,

473
00:23:14,658 --> 00:23:17,159
soaybe he's not
a murderer yet.

474
00:23:17,193 --> 00:23:18,760
But it's definitely him.

475
00:23:18,794 --> 00:23:20,962
This is defitely something
he's going to do.

476
00:23:20,996 --> 00:23:22,896
What do you want me
to do about it?

477
00:23:22,931 --> 00:23:24,965
I mean call the future police

478
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,533
or hop in a time machine
or something

479
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:28,869
and stop this murder that you
dreamed about from happening?

480
00:23:28,903 --> 00:23:32,171
How about I just go in there
and punch him in the nose?

481
00:23:32,205 --> 00:23:34,006
That wouldn't cast
too big a pall

482
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,507
on the proceedings,
would it?

483
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,843
Oh, that's right,
I almost forgot:

484
00:23:37,877 --> 00:23:39,477
we're supposed to get married.

485
00:23:39,512 --> 00:23:43,547
And instead, we both just walked
out of our rehearsal dinner,

486
00:23:43,582 --> 00:23:45,215
stand out here
by the garbage

487
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:47,283
and have a chat about
my second cousin by marriage,

488
00:23:47,317 --> 00:23:48,317
the high school
chemistry teacher

489
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:50,218
who you think might be
Jack the Ripper

490
00:23:50,252 --> 00:23:51,986
in the 21st century.

491
00:23:52,021 --> 00:23:53,287
Are you mocking me?

492
00:23:53,321 --> 00:23:55,354
No, t I think
you're mocking us.

493
00:23:55,389 --> 00:23:58,090
Or at least you're doing
your damndest to kill this thing

494
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:01,159
before it even
gets started.

495
00:24:01,193 --> 00:24:03,027
I don't know
what's going on with you

496
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:05,230
the past couple days, Allison.

497
00:24:05,265 --> 00:24:07,099
This is nuts.

498
00:24:07,134 --> 00:24:08,834
I want to rry you.

499
00:24:08,869 --> 00:24:11,070
Do you still want
to marry me?

500
00:24:11,104 --> 00:24:12,838
Of course I do.

501
00:24:12,872 --> 00:24:14,573
Okay.

502
00:24:14,607 --> 00:24:17,308
Then that is the here and now.

503
00:24:17,343 --> 00:24:20,177
All this other stuff, this dream
stuff, this fure stuff,

504
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:23,247
I am not dealing with it,
not now, not tonight.

505
00:24:23,281 --> 00:24:26,183
And you shouldn't be eithe

506
00:24:43,098 --> 00:24:45,032
Come on. Let's
go back inside.

507
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,533
Are you sure?

508
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:50,501
No matter what else I say,

509
00:24:50,536 --> 00:24:53,870
no matter what else I do,

510
00:24:53,905 --> 00:24:57,375
you are my here and now, Joe.

511
00:24:57,409 --> 00:25:00,444
You are my always
and forever.

512
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,281
Please.

513
00:25:16,423 --> 00:25:19,658
Joe...

514
00:25:19,693 --> 00:25:22,127
Any luck reaching Allison?

515
00:25:22,161 --> 00:25:24,962
Yeah, she just called
me back finally.

516
00:25:24,997 --> 00:25:27,935
In the car on the way over here.

517
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,171
She's, uh, she's flying in.

518
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:32,340
She's going to be here tonight.

519
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:34,442
There's not that many flights
from Dallas.

520
00:25:38,379 --> 00:25:41,180
HI don't think she believes it.

521
00:25:41,214 --> 00:25:44,015
It's not like she said
she was giving up.

522
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,583
Not like she said
that she was moving back.

523
00:25:46,651 --> 00:25:49,118
She's going to want
to see it for herself.

524
00:25:49,153 --> 00:25:52,855
I never understood it.

525
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:54,589
We must have gotten
300, 400ips.

526
00:25:54,624 --> 00:25:56,492
Why that one?
Why Texas?

527
00:25:56,526 --> 00:25:58,493
Well, you
know Allison.

528
00:25:58,527 --> 00:26:03,096
When she heard somebody
saw our little daughter...

529
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:06,666
getting into a car in Plano,

530
00:26:06,701 --> 00:26:12,072
she just knew, and there was
no convincing her otherwise.

531
00:26:12,106 --> 00:26:14,942
Seven months.

532
00:26:14,977 --> 00:26:18,278
Seven months living
in a hotel room.

533
00:26:18,313 --> 00:26:20,413
Just knocking on doors

534
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:23,116
and showing her picture
to strangers.

535
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:26,086
I don't know how she does it.

536
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:29,822
So let's get this over with,
okay?

537
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,358
I got to warn you, Joe,

538
00:26:33,393 --> 00:26:35,794
she was in that hole
for an awfully long time.

539
00:27:03,486 --> 00:27:05,887
That bracelet...

540
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:13,126
Allison and I gave her that
for her 16th birthday.

541
00:27:16,263 --> 00:27:20,165
That's her.

542
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:22,200
That's our daughter.

543
00:27:38,712 --> 00:27:41,813
Come on, tell me
you're happy for me.

544
00:27:41,848 --> 00:27:43,115
I am.

545
00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:45,483
I'm extremely happy for you.

546
00:27:45,518 --> 00:27:50,121
I'm just maybe a little
sad for myself.

547
00:27:52,657 --> 00:27:54,858
But it's a good sadness.

548
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,464
It's the same sadness
that I felt

549
00:28:02,499 --> 00:28:04,532
when you went off
to college,

550
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:07,835
and when you moved
to Phoenix.

551
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,605
Just beten us,
I think I might be

552
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:15,908
just a tiny bit jeous
of your wife-to-be.

553
00:28:15,942 --> 00:28:17,142
But I'll get over it.

554
00:28:18,511 --> 00:28:21,946
Hey, kid, I just got a message
from the maid of honor.

555
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,147
Your fncÃ©e would like
a rd with you.

556
00:28:25,683 --> 00:28:27,350
ck at the inn.

557
00:28:27,384 --> 00:28:29,586
What do you mean,
back at the inn?

558
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,321
Allison's not here?

559
00:28:35,725 --> 00:28:38,660
You're not even dresd yet.

560
00:28:38,694 --> 00:28:40,928
Everyone's waiting.

561
00:28:40,963 --> 00:28:44,231
Joe, the girl
I've been dreaming about--

562
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:48,067
e one your cousin strangles--

563
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:50,202
she's r daughter, Joe.

564
00:28:50,237 --> 00:28:52,404
We don't have a daughter.
I mean, not yet.

565
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,639
But we will.

566
00:28:54,674 --> 00:28:56,941
And your cousin is going
to murder her.

567
00:28:57,743 --> 00:29:02,346
Okay. And you know this
because...?

568
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,880
Because I saw it.

569
00:29:03,915 --> 00:29:05,949
I saw it in my dreams.

570
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:11,920
When is this going to happen?

571
00:29:11,955 --> 00:29:13,655
I mean, in your dreams.

572
00:29:13,689 --> 00:29:15,790
A year from now,
two years, three years?

573
00:29:15,824 --> 00:29:17,425
No, she's a teenager.

574
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:19,193
She's a young woman.

575
00:29:19,227 --> 00:29:24,030
So we're talking like 16, 17, 18
years from now maybe?

576
00:29:24,065 --> 00:29:26,065
'Cause I keep thinking
about the 85 people

577
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,933
who are sitting there
on that golf course

578
00:29:27,968 --> 00:29:29,268
waiting for us right now.

579
00:29:29,302 --> 00:29:31,436
I don't know what to tell you.

580
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,270
I don't know
what to say to them.

581
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:34,938
I can't go through with this.

582
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,807
Because of these dreams--

583
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,608
that take place
a couple decades from now?

584
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:42,111
Look, I know it sounds
ridiculous,

585
00:29:42,146 --> 00:29:45,114
but all these horrible
things that I'm seeing

586
00:29:45,148 --> 00:29:47,716
take place in a world
whe we're married.

587
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:52,353
I can't help but think,
maybe if we don't get married.

588
00:29:52,387 --> 00:29:55,489
Maybe if I just raise
this baby on my own.

589
00:29:55,523 --> 00:29:56,890
Tell me you love me.

590
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:57,991
I love you.

591
00:29:58,025 --> 00:29:59,192
This isn't about that?

592
00:29:59,226 --> 00:30:01,127
Honey, it's not about that.

593
00:30:01,161 --> 00:30:02,595
Okay, then mar me.

594
00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:04,763
'Cause none of the rest
of it matters.

595
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:06,431
How can you say that?

596
00:30:06,466 --> 00:30:09,200
Because I know it to be true.

597
00:30:09,235 --> 00:30:11,002
As a scientist, as a physicist,

598
00:30:11,036 --> 00:30:14,004
as a person who studies
the physical facts of the world,

599
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,606
I'm telling you, Allison,

600
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,308
these things that you dream
arjust that: dreams.

601
00:30:18,342 --> 00:30:19,642
No.

602
00:30:19,677 --> 00:30:21,277
Yes.

603
00:30:21,312 --> 00:30:24,113
Don't you see your fear
is based on your certainty

604
00:30:24,147 --> 00:30:26,648
at these things are going
to happen?

605
00:30:26,682 --> 00:30:29,417
Whereas the one thing
that centuries of science

606
00:30:29,451 --> 00:30:32,019
have taught us, is that
the only thing that's certain

607
00:30:32,054 --> 00:30:34,021
is that nothing is for certain.

608
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:35,155
You don't believe me.

609
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,023
I completely believe you.

610
00:30:37,058 --> 00:30:40,726
You say you see these things,
I believe you see these things.

611
00:30:40,761 --> 00:30:44,029
I just know that
none of it matters... yet.

612
00:30:44,063 --> 00:30:47,198
The things that you're seeing,
Allison, they could happen,

613
00:30:47,232 --> 00:30:48,966
but they don't have to happen.

614
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,367
Life is not like that.

615
00:30:50,401 --> 00:30:52,969
Life is much more complicated
than that.

616
00:30:53,003 --> 00:30:55,737
We're not hurtling down
a predetermined path

617
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:58,206
towards a foregone conclusion.

618
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,974
We people, all of us, we make...

619
00:31:00,008 --> 00:31:03,076
we make thousands
of decisions a day--

620
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,145
little ones, tiny ones--
turn left, turn right.

621
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:08,114
I will have that drink.
I won't lie to that girl.

622
00:31:08,148 --> 00:31:10,149
I will take my child's hand.

623
00:31:10,184 --> 00:31:12,351
I don't have to save
for a rainy day.

624
00:31:12,385 --> 00:31:16,121
You take all those choices times
all the people in the rld,

625
00:31:16,156 --> 00:31:17,656
including the ones not yet born,

626
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:20,959
and you have to conclude
the future is not set.

627
00:31:20,993 --> 00:31:22,326
It can't be.

628
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:24,762
And that's the best part
about being alive.

629
00:31:24,796 --> 00:31:27,932
It's always new.
It's always surprising.

630
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:30,334
Now, I'm willing
to take my chances

631
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:32,903
that our future is going
to be a great one--

632
00:31:32,938 --> 00:31:37,340
for you, for me, for that
little child inside of you.

633
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:40,043
So come on. Put on your dress.

634
00:31:40,077 --> 00:31:42,244
Our future's waiting.

635
00:31:44,614 --> 00:31:46,548
I can't.

636
00:31:49,218 --> 00:31:51,652
I can't.
I know that you're right.

637
00:31:51,686 --> 00:31:55,755
I know these things that
I'm seeing might not happen,

638
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,124
but they might.

639
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,894
And that "might" is too much
for me to live with.

640
00:32:05,431 --> 00:32:11,435
I can't even put into words
how sorry I am, Joe,

641
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:13,704
but I can't may you..

642
00:32:13,738 --> 00:32:16,706
not today...

643
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,208
not ever.

644
00:32:32,134 --> 00:32:33,534
GRANDMA BENOIT:
Just wanted
to stop back,

645
00:32:35,202 --> 00:32:38,535
tell you how much
I like your intended.

646
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:40,046
I think he's terrific.

647
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,125
I like the way he thinks.

648
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,194
I-I like what he stands for.

649
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:49,001
What are you tking about,
Grandma?

650
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:51,036
I'm not getting married.

651
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,270
The wedding is off.

652
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:55,173
I don't understand.

653
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:58,610
You told me to believe
in the things I see...

654
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:02,813
that I see the things I do
for a reason.

655
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,548
Just a second!

656
00:33:22,763 --> 00:33:24,529
I came for Joe's things.

657
00:33:24,564 --> 00:33:27,899
Marjorie, I feel awful
about this whole thing.

658
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:39,040
Maybe when you get a moment,

659
00:33:39,075 --> 00:33:41,576
you could pull
his things together

660
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,878
and pack them in his bag.

661
00:33:43,912 --> 00:33:46,180
I'll-I'll send a bellman.

662
00:33:47,448 --> 00:33:51,084
My husband is on the phone
right now calling the airlines

663
00:33:51,118 --> 00:33:53,452
trying to see
if we can all get out of here

664
00:33:53,487 --> 00:33:54,853
a day early, but it's hard

665
00:33:54,888 --> 00:33:56,854
to get sometng done
on a Sunday.

666
00:33:56,889 --> 00:33:58,856
I love him.

667
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:01,291
You need to know I love him.

668
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:04,059
I know you broke his heart.

669
00:34:04,093 --> 00:34:08,462
And that's really all
I need to know.

670
00:34:10,297 --> 00:34:14,165
Allison, marriage isn't just
an act of love.

671
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,500
It's an act of will.

672
00:34:15,534 --> 00:34:17,500
And  you can't even muster
up the will

673
00:34:17,535 --> 00:34:19,101
to make it to the ceremony,

674
00:34:19,135 --> 00:34:22,037
then this is probably best
for all of us.

675
00:34:30,314 --> 00:34:32,849
You want some?

676
00:34:32,883 --> 00:34:35,852
'Cause there's about 79 more
where it came from, huh?

677
00:34:35,886 --> 00:34:37,255
Come on.

678
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,191
Have a bite.

679
00:34:39,225 --> 00:34:40,325
Are you serious?

680
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,961
Look, kiddo, you just got left
at the altar.

681
00:34:43,996 --> 00:34:47,497
You have the rt of your life
to-to stew about that.

682
00:34:47,532 --> 00:34:49,999
Right now there's...
there's od food,

683
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:50,967
there's good drink,

684
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:52,969
and it cost me
an arm and a leg,

685
00:34:53,003 --> 00:34:55,638
so I say come on,
let's try and enjoy it.

686
00:34:55,672 --> 00:34:57,739
Hmm?

687
00:34:57,774 --> 00:35:01,209
Uh, sir, I'm gonna pack up
my stuff, so...

688
00:35:01,243 --> 00:35:02,510
Pack up?

689
00:35:02,544 --> 00:35:04,778
I paid you to work
for five hours.

690
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:06,647
You want your tip?

691
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:07,848
Of course, sir.
Good.

692
00:35:07,882 --> 00:35:09,216
Get over there
and play sething.

693
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,517
What do you
want to hear?

694
00:35:10,551 --> 00:35:13,152
Uh, I don't want
to hear anything.

695
00:35:13,186 --> 00:35:15,821
So, my son is sad.

696
00:35:15,855 --> 00:35:17,990
Why don't you play
something happy?

697
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,694
Any luck with the airline?

698
00:35:22,728 --> 00:35:24,596
Uh. None at all.

699
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,530
I'm afraid we're all here
for the duration.

700
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:28,198
Nobody goes anywhere
until Monday afternoon.

701
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,467
Oh, boy, just the three of us.

702
00:35:31,501 --> 00:35:35,938
âª âª

703
00:35:35,973 --> 00:35:37,606
Fantastic.

704
00:35:37,641 --> 00:35:39,608
What the hell's the matter
with that kid?

705
00:35:39,642 --> 00:35:41,143
I asked for
something happy.

706
00:35:44,381 --> 00:35:48,616
You went to see her,
didn't you?

707
00:35:48,651 --> 00:35:52,620
You just couldn't
help yourself?

708
00:35:52,654 --> 00:35:55,722
How is she?

709
00:35:55,757 --> 00:35:58,090
Does it matter?

710
00:35:59,726 --> 00:36:02,961
Upset.

711
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:04,829
She told me she loves you.

712
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:08,730
âª âª

713
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:12,500
This? Really?

714
00:36:12,534 --> 00:36:15,635
What? He's not gonna hear
his wedding song today.

715
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,570
We might as well
hear ours.

716
00:36:17,604 --> 00:36:20,205
Come on, Marjie.

717
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,706
I'll let you lead, huh?

718
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:25,610
No, I-I don't really think
this is a very good idea.
Aw...

719
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:27,944
If the's not
gonna be a wedding,

720
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:29,746
I-I have to change
my shoes.

721
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,682
âª âª

722
00:36:33,717 --> 00:36:36,851
Well, I gave it
the old college try.

723
00:36:36,886 --> 00:36:38,252
She's hurting, Dad.

724
00:36:38,287 --> 00:36:43,023
I think she's had all the pain
she can handle for today.

725
00:36:43,057 --> 00:36:44,224
It's sad.

726
00:36:44,258 --> 00:36:46,059
You two really did
love each other.

727
00:36:46,093 --> 00:36:48,661
Oh, I think we still do.

728
00:36:48,695 --> 00:36:50,863
I love <i>her</i> anyway.

729
00:36:50,897 --> 00:36:52,865
Then what happened?

730
00:36:52,899 --> 00:36:59,370
Well, the problem, I suppose,
is the <i>way</i> I love her.

731
00:36:59,404 --> 00:37:01,205
It's, uh, I don't know.

732
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:03,407
It's more the big picture way,
not...

733
00:37:03,441 --> 00:37:05,442
you know, the day-to-day way.

734
00:37:05,476 --> 00:37:08,778
And 27 years of marriage...

735
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:10,379
That's a lot of days.

736
00:37:10,413 --> 00:37:13,649
Sure is.

737
00:37:17,686 --> 00:37:20,454
It's my own damn fault.

738
00:37:23,892 --> 00:37:26,926
REPORTER
Democratic presidential nominee
Bill Clinton

739
00:37:26,961 --> 00:37:28,027
promised that an announcement

740
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:30,596
on his list of
vice presidential candidates

741
00:37:30,631 --> 00:37:32,665
would be coming
within the week.

742
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:36,534
Campaign manager James Carville
said that among....

743
00:38:15,665 --> 00:38:18,366
"She drove off
in her little blue car,

744
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,335
and no one's seen her since."

745
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,937
<i>Space Q7...</i>

746
00:38:23,972 --> 00:38:27,040
<i>San Luis Obispo Airport.</i>

747
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:39,417
Hello. Is this
the San Luis Obispo police?

748
00:38:39,452 --> 00:38:41,919
I have some informion

749
00:38:41,954 --> 00:38:44,855
about the missing girl
Julie Pinsley,

750
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:48,525
some very specific information.

751
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,329
Hello?

752
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,265
Who is it?

753
00:38:59,502 --> 00:39:01,602
Hello?!

754
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:08,775
You know what?
You were right.

755
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,745
We're not hurtling down
a predetermined path

756
00:39:11,779 --> 00:39:14,414
towards a foregone conclusion.

757
00:39:14,448 --> 00:39:17,650
That's the best part
about being alive.

758
00:39:17,684 --> 00:39:19,952
Okay.

759
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:25,090
The police found
that missing girl.

760
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:27,292
She <i>was</i> dead...

761
00:39:27,327 --> 00:39:29,528
in the trunk of her own car.

762
00:39:29,562 --> 00:39:33,331
And that...
and that changes things?

763
00:39:33,365 --> 00:39:35,532
Well, it does for me.

764
00:39:35,567 --> 00:39:38,101
It means that everything that
you were telling me yesterday,

765
00:39:38,136 --> 00:39:39,936
I should have listened.

766
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:44,974
Joe, I think you're the smartest
man I've ever met in my life.

767
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:46,776
Okay, wait a second.
Wait a second.

768
00:39:46,811 --> 00:39:48,411
What about our child?

769
00:39:48,446 --> 00:39:50,079
What about my cousin?

770
00:39:50,114 --> 00:39:51,948
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

771
00:39:51,982 --> 00:39:53,215
I think after tonight,

772
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:57,786
we don't have to worry
about that anymore.

773
00:39:57,821 --> 00:40:00,389
Don't ask me how I know that...

774
00:40:00,423 --> 00:40:02,023
but I do.

775
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,796
Okay, if you say so.

776
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:11,332
No, no, wait.

777
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:13,066
Listen...

778
00:40:13,101 --> 00:40:14,668
I really don't want
to leave here

779
00:40:14,702 --> 00:40:17,101
without doing
what we came here to do.

780
00:40:17,136 --> 00:40:20,037
I know it's been

781
00:40:20,071 --> 00:40:22,105
a crazy few days.

782
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:24,072
I know everybody's heading home.

783
00:40:24,106 --> 00:40:27,440
I know tomorrow's a Monday.

784
00:40:27,474 --> 00:40:31,775
I know that there's
a thousand reasons to say no.

785
00:40:34,978 --> 00:40:37,880
But please...

786
00:40:37,914 --> 00:40:40,248
Joe Dubois...

787
00:40:40,283 --> 00:40:41,983
is there any chance

788
00:40:42,018 --> 00:40:44,352
that Ian convince you
to marry me?

789
00:40:44,386 --> 00:40:47,521

âª âª

802
00:41:29,122 --> 00:41:32,257

I now pronounce you
man and wife.

804

805
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,766
Oh, hell, Joey,
go ahead and kiss her.

806
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:47,203
âª âª

807
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:01,717
Where is this? This place

808
00:42:01,751 --> 00:42:03,151
where you and Mommy
got married?

809
00:42:03,185 --> 00:42:07,590
Uh, California,
a place call San Luis Obispo.

810
00:42:07,624 --> 00:42:09,759
You and Mommy both lived here
in Phoenix, right?

811
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:12,027
Why'd you have to go
all the way out there

812
00:42:12,061 --> 00:42:13,528
to get married?

813
00:42:13,563 --> 00:42:15,864
You know, I can't
remember why,

814
00:42:15,898 --> 00:42:18,132
but it turned out
to be the perfect spot.

815
00:42:18,167 --> 00:42:20,267
Yeah...

816
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,704
It sure did.
