1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,600
Al? Hey, Allison?

2
00:00:11,866 --> 00:00:13,799
Are you hearing this?

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,501
Ariel?

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,501
What the...?!

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,700
Whose baby is that?

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,300
And where's Ariel?

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,600
Joe, keep your voice down.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,401
Where's our daughter?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,599
She's right here.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,468
Ariel's right here.

11
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,799
Oh, Joe.

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,767
My God, Joe, it's Bridgette and Marie.

13
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,799
It can't be.

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,833
How is that possible?

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,599
Allison.

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,000
Come on, Al, help me make sense of this.

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,066
I think maybe it's my fault.

18
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,267
I've been wishing for it secretly.

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,734
Okay. I get it.

20
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,000
You're upset. But don't you think
you're being a little bit immature?

21
00:01:31,568 --> 00:01:32,668
So, listen...

22
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,900
What do you think about
having another baby?

23
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:44,467

00:01:44,534 --> 00:01:48,568
forom.com

25
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,899
Bridgette!

26
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,900
That's nice.

27
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,533
She's practicing.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Make it stop!

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,099
I'm begging you to make it stop.

30
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,799
Hey, she's your sister,

31
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,099
she's been at this all of two weeks,

32
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,633
and this is important to her.

33
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:54,133
What she really needs
is your encouragement.

34
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,499
And she's got it.

35
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm encouraging her to stop.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,499
Great.

37
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,433
I was just getting the hang of it,
and the reed breaks.

38
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,299
Bridge, okay, come over here.

39
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,599
We'll get you another one.

40
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,099
Have some breakfast.

41
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,900
That really stinks.
I wanted Mommy to hear me play.

42
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,700
Don't worry about it.
Mommy isn't even here.

43
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:16,833
She got a ride with
Detective Scanlon this morning.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,167
Do me a favor. Go get dressed.

45
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:20,099
I'll make you something
to eat in the car.

46
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,400
And you promise that we'll go down
to the music shop

47
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,700
and get me a new reed right after school?

48
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,999
Absolutely, I promise.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,634
Oh, Lee,

50
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:30,800
she's so beautiful.

51
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,034
Thanks.

52
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,199
So, how's Lynn adjusting?

53
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,899
There was no adjusting. It was instant.

54
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,234
The second little Lee came
into the world, bam, she was a mom.

55
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:43,500
What is it with you women and kids?
It's like a drug.

56
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:46,100
It is pretty amazing.

57
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,934
I woke up this morning convinced
that I had to have another one.

58
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:52,234
Oh, I don't know what came over mere.

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,333
What did Joe have to say about that?

60
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,700
Nothing. He pretended he was asleep.

61
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,667
Yeah. Well, it's different for guys.

62
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,699
It's an adjustment.

63
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,834
A great adjustment ;
a fantastic adjustment;

64
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:05,300
but an adjustment.

65
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:08,834
Tomorrow night's date night.

66
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:11,166
I finally convinced her to get a sitter,

67
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:13,033
leave little Lee for a couple hours.

68
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,667
Ooh! Big step.

69
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:15,834
Are you excited?

70
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:17,534
I'm excited. She's terrified.

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,799
Detective, advise your 20.

72
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,434
I've got a Code Two in Fountain Hills.

73
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,499
So you woke up... what time?

74
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,300
6:45, give or take?

75
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,734
The baby's just gone?

76
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,967
Housekeeper's just vanished?

77
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,799
He's not in the nursery,
she's not in her room.

78
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,000
Her room? She has a room?

79
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,800
She stays here five nights a week

80
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,200
in case the baby fusses
or wakes up during the night.

81
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,799
And his name is Bryce?

82
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,166
Bryce, yes.

83
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,499
And that's a very recent photo-
last weekend.

84
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Here's a picture of Elizabeth.

85
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,599
The housekeeper.

86
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,200
You said her last name was Torres.

87
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,300
Yes.

88
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,801
And during the night,
you didn't hear anything?

89
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:58,800
The baby didn't cry or anything, so,

90
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,733
you have no idea what time this happened?

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,799
No.

92
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,932
How about your wife?
Did she hear anything?

93
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:06,566
Obviously, no.

94
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,299
So, is this it?

95
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,933
Is it just you two?

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
A forensic team and some more
detectives are on their way.

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,500
We'll get these to every media
outlet in the area.

98
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:20,267
We'll get a description of the car
up on Amber Alert.

99
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,299
Can I speak with Mrs. Carlo?

100
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,599
Of course.

101
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,300
She was just... putting on some clothes.

102
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,101
She'll be... She'll be down in a minute.

103
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,300
Is the nursery upstairs?

104
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:29,699
Yes.

105
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,234
Do you mind if I take a look?

106
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,199
I'll be up in a bit.

107
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,100
I'm gonna talk to the mother,

108
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,501
and I want to be here when
the rest of the cavalry shows up.

109
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:17,201
Should I not be in here?

110
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,500
I see you're wearing gloves.

111
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:21,800
I shouldn't be in here, right?

112
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,234
I might ruin some clues or something?

113
00:06:25,901 --> 00:06:27,299
Mrs. Carlo?

114
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,200
Dana.

115
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,034
You're with the police?

116
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,599
My name is Allison.

117
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,634
I'm with the District Attorney's Office.

118
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,699
We're gonna find him.

119
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,499
Wherever she went, wherever she took him,

120
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,767
w- we're gonna find him.

121
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,799
I'm not worried.

122
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,199
I mean, of course I'm worried, but...

123
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,499
I also know that there's
no one on the planet

124
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,732
that loves Bryce as much as I do,
except Elizabeth.

125
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,500
She worships him.

126
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:55,933
She lives for him, and that's how I know.

127
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,534
That's how I know he's okay.

128
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,334
But you do believe that she took him?

129
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:05,100
Well, maybe she did,
and maybe she didn't.

130
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,066
I mean, maybe this is all a dream,

131
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,439
a nightmare.

132
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,799
In a little while, I'll wake up,

133
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,400
and Elizabeth will be downstairs
holding Bryce,

134
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,300
and we'll sing songs and play games,

135
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,567
and it'll just be another day.

136
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,500
What do you think the chances are that
this address for Elizabeth Torres is good?

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,566
That we knock on the door, she opens it?

138
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,933
That the baby's there,
asleep peacefully in a laundry basket?

139
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,833
Ms. Torres, it's the police.

140
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,134
If you don't open up on
the count of three, we're coming in.

141
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,399
One...

142
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,600
two... three.

143
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,699
Okay, home before lunch.

144
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,700
Nice work if you can get it.

145
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:04,533
Allison, you okay?

146
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,333
Yeah.

147
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,733
No, I'm fine.

148
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,199
Are you sure?

149
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,534
It's that little baby.
I can't get it out of my head.

150
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:15,999
Don't worry.

151
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,899
You know, something's got to give.

152
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,734
There's got to be a ransom demand.

153
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,200
Someone will spot this Elizabeth.

154
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,333
Something will break. It always does.

155
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,399
Hello.

156
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,633
Hi. You're at home?

157
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,733
I- I called your office,
I called your cell.

158
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,599
It's a long story.

159
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,400
Are you okay? You sound upset.

160
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,800
Do you hear that?

161
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Hear what?

162
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,800
Nothing. I don't hear it now.

163
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,200
Hey, listen,

164
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:18,800
what music store did
you rent Bridgette's clarinet from?

165
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,200
I promised her that I'd get her
a new reed on the way home from school.

166
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:24,800
Marshall's. I got it at Marshall's.

167
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,499
There it is again. Do you hear it?

168
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,199
No.

169
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,333
Marshall's, huh?

170
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,400
Allison, are you all right?

171
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,534
Allison?

172
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,500
Yeah. Honey, I'm fine.

173
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,601
I'll see you when you get home.

174
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,750
Baby?

175
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,767
Shh, I'm here now, honey.

176
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,499
What do you want, honey?

177
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,000
Something you want in the garage?

178
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,734
It's the car.

179
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,299
It's the car.

180
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,300
You wanted to be in the car?

181
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,367
Oh, my God, I'm talking to a picture.

182
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,700
You want to go for a ride, don't you?

183
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,899
Okay.

184
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,700
Wait right here,
I'm gonna get my purse and my keys.

185
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,599
Bridge, what are you doing?

186
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,399
Put that back!

187
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,299
Don't play with that.

188
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,933
- That's not yours.
- Okay.

189
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,933
Come on, help me find a reed.

190
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,099
Okay, what size are we looking for?

191
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,434
One, one and a half?

192
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:40,568
She with you two?

193
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,199
How long has she been playing?

194
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,734
What are you talking about?

195
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,767
She can't play.

196
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,800
Which house is it?

197
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
What, did I pass it?

198
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,500
Hello?

199
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,066
Hello, is anybody home?

200
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,700
I hope you know what
you're getting us into.

201
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,300
Hello?

202
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,400
Is anybody home?

203
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:55,399
I'm with the District Attorney's Office.

204
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,699
I'd like to ask you
some questions about a missing baby.

205
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,399
What is it now?

206
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,599
Baby?

207
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,500
Baby?

208
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:13,500
Keep crying, I'm gonna find you,
I'm here!

209
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,301
It's you, Bryce, isn't it?

210
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,101
Come on, you gotta tell me
how you did that.

211
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:37,399
I don't know how I did it.

212
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,299
Just leave me alone.

213
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,899
Okay, one half hour
of TV then homework, okay?

214
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,899
Hi, I gotta talk to you.

215
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,300
I need to talk to you, too.

216
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,300
Okay, you first.

217
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,399
No, no, no. You go. What's going on?

218
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,299
Okay, I took the kids to an early dinner,
like you suggested,

219
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,367
but something happened
in the music store.

220
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,867
Something that makes absolutely
no sense whatsoever.

221
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,967
Now I'm thinking maybe
you should go first.

222
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,499
What is that?

223
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,799
It's a baby!

224
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,000
Yeah, no, I sussed that part out.

225
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:12,001
What is it doing here?

226
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,599
Come on, little sweetie.

227
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,467
Oh, I don't even know
how to start explaining this.

228
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:22,299
Okay, well, any effort
you make will be much appreciated.

229
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,467
Right, well, the short version
is his name is Bryce Carlo.

230
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,201
His housekeeper kidnapped him
this morning and I found him.

231
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,999
Okay, and what?

232
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,333
We're, like, waiting
for the police to come get him?

233
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,999
Allison?

234
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,933
I haven't called the police.

235
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,899
Because...?

236
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,967
Because I'm not sure I'm supposed to.

237
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,600
Oh, okay, yeah,
I can help you with this.

238
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,299
You're supposed to.

239
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,134
No, you don't understand.

240
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,699
There's something about this little boy.

241
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,234
From the moment I heard that he was gone.

242
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:57,299
From the moment I saw his picture,

243
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,599
I knew I was supposed to look for him.

244
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,100
I was supposed to find him.

245
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,167
And now I think I'm supposed to keep him.

246
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:06,099
Allison, he has parents.

247
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,700
Yeah, I know, I met them.

248
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,434
But they're probably frantic.

249
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:13,200
Well, his father is concerned
but his mother is oddly calm.

250
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:15,833
What are you talking about, oddly calm?

251
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,700
She's probably in shock.

252
00:16:17,766 --> 00:16:19,367
And what difference does that make?

253
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,599
It's her baby.

254
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,799
Just because you took him
from a kidnapper

255
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,799
doesn't make you any less of a kidnapper.

256
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,600
No, you're wrong!
You don't understand.

257
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,633
He's supposed to be here;
he's supposed to be with me.

258
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,600
Oh, look!

259
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,099
He's smiling! He knows I'm right!

260
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,200
He's smiling, that's your proof?

261
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,300
That's your answer, he's smiling?

262
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,866
He's a baby! They all smile.

263
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,666
That's standard equipment on a baby-
that's what they do.

264
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,599
Allison, people go to jail
for this for a very long time.

265
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,299
What are you doing?

266
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,600
I'm trying to protect you from yourself.

267
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,900
I'm gonna try and reach somebody-

268
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:53,567
a friend on the phone-
Scanlon or Devalos.

269
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,034
Somebody who can take this baby

270
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,599
back to its rightful parents.

271
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
- No!
- Hey, yes!

272
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,566
You already have children.

273
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,000
And they don't want to only
see you on visitor's day.

274
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,400
- Hey.
- Hi.

275
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,299
Sorry. I know I'm late,
but it was so hard to leave her.

276
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,499
She kept looking at me
like I was abandoning her.

277
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,300
I know it's tough,

278
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,934
but it's good practice for next week,
when you go back to work.

279
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,099
Okay, and I don't want
to think about that tonight.

280
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,200
A drink for madam?

281
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:26,966
Yeah. She will have a martini with...

282
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,533
No, no, no. Breastfeeding,
breastfeeding, breastfeeding.

283
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,599
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

284
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,400
We will have a bottle
of your finest water.

285
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,500
Thank you.

286
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,599
So how'd she check out?

287
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,699
Sorry. Who?

288
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,599
The baby-sitter.

289
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,699
You were gonna run her license.

290
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,500
Lynn, she's 17. She's clean as a whistle.

291
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,600
- What are you doing?
- I'm texting her.

292
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,800
Baby's not used to getting
milk from a bottle from a stranger.

293
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,099
I just need to make sure
everything's going okay.

294
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,666
And would we like to hear
the specials for tonight?

295
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:57,233
Not me. I can't really eat anything.

296
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,099
What?

297
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,132
Well, I've got to get
this baby weight off.

298
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:02,033
Nothing fits me.

299
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,999
I hate the way I look.

300
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,099
You look fantastic,
and you have to eat something.

301
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,401
Could you give us a few minutes?

302
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:10,599
What are you doing?

303
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,466
She hasn't texted back.

304
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,067
You just texted her.

305
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,866
You just texted her.

306
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,799
Besides, maybe she's taking
care of the baby.

307
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,332
She can't text you if
she's taking care of the baby.

308
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,700
And I also know that
the whole idea of tonight

309
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,501
is for the two of us
to have a good time,

310
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,733
to get your mind off the baby and relax.

311
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,800
All right?

312
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,499
What's going on?
Are you all right?

313
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,967
Yeah, I think I had my phone on vibrate.

314
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,166
Scanlon here.

315
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,599
Well, I'm just kind of
in the middle of something.

316
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,999
Yes, sir.

317
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You got it.

318
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,799
I know that look.

319
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,201
The Carlo case-
there's been a breakthrough.

320
00:18:57,368 --> 00:18:58,500
I'll see you at home ?

321
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:00,101
Yeah, I'll see you at home.

322
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,900
Obviously, the most important thing
is that Bryce is home safely.

323
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,300
We'll let you know more as it develops,
but that's all for now. Thank you.

324
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,799
It's okay. You did the right thing.

325
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,667
You know you did the right thing.

326
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,099
Okay, mission accomplished.

327
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,199
As far as the Carlos are concerned,

328
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,567
Allison led Lee to their son.

329
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:26,499
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

330
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,901
I don't understand.

331
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,334
What was Bryce doing
in that strange house all alone ?

332
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,499
We don't know yet.

333
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,400
Yeah, the house is owned
by a woman named Maribella Gomez.

334
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,600
She freely admits that she's friends
with the housekeeper, Elizabeth Torres,

335
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,367
but has no idea what's going on.

336
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,500
She wasn't home when Elizabeth
came by to stash the baby.

337
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,099
Has no idea why she would have broken
into her house,

338
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,267
no idea where she is now.

339
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,199
Listen, Allison, if you're up to it,

340
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:53,533
the Carlos would like
to thank you personally.

341
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,899
I know it sounds crazy,

342
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,868
but if I can't hold him, protect him...

343
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,667
Maybe some other time.

344
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,267
Allison...

345
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,867
Oh, geez.

346
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,799
It's Bryce's.

347
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,366
I guess somehow we missed it.

348
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,899
Come on.

349
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,900
Give it to me.

350
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,667
Come on, I got to get rid of it.

351
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,199
And Allison, I'm not trying to be mean,

352
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,599
but that blanket is- it's evidence

353
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,067
that Bryce was here,
that he was in our house, so...

354
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,699
come on, I gotta have it.

355
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,233
I gotta burn it or something.

356
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,300
It's okay. I'll do it.

357
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:48,899
I will; I'll do it.

358
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,034
In the morning.

359
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,699
Oh, my goodness.

360
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,700
I am so thrilled that you stopped by.

361
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,568
I was so worried
I wouldn't get a chance to thank you.

362
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,234
I know I must have seemed
a little crazy yesterday,

363
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:21,799
talking about how much
I trusted Elizabeth,

364
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,933
even though she took my baby.

365
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,634
It's just,
sometimes things are so awful,

366
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:28,800
it's like your brain can't take them in.

367
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,901
No, I completely understand.

368
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:31,499
I can't imagine what I would do

369
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,368
if I woke up and one
of my babies was gone.

370
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,100
Well, speaking of which, where's Bryce?

371
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:39,499
I'd really love to see him.

372
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,899
I kind of miss that little guy.

373
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,099
Well, actually, you just missed him.

374
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,600
My husband Scott took him over to
his grandparents for a little while.

375
00:21:46,934 --> 00:21:48,934
Oh, well, that's nice.

376
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,399
Maybe I could just hang out

377
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,500
till they get back.

378
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
well, that's probably Scott now.

379
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,866
Let me just see when
he plans on heading back.

380
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,367
Are you the lady
who brought my brother back?

381
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,433
I wish you hadn't done that.

382
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,799
He's not safe here.

383
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm afraid Scott and Bryce
will be gone all... day.

384
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,700
it caught my eye.

385
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,133
That's Lucy.

386
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,833
She would've been six.

387
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,034
She fell ill last year

388
00:22:57,201 --> 00:22:59,301
and died very suddenly.

389
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,299
I'm so sorry.

390
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,433
Be a year at Christmas.

391
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,799
I don't know if you heard me,
Scott and Bryce...

392
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,001
they'll be gone all day.

393
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,735
Well, give Bryce a- a hug for me.

394
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,199
And thank you for the tea.

395
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,133
No, thank you.

396
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,500
Thank you for everything.

397
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,600
Actually, Mrs. Lovett,
I wasn't calling about Bridgette.

398
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,200
I was calling about our six-year-old.

399
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,800
I was wondering if she could get
music lessons, too, you know?

400
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,733
Maybe we could- we could do them,

401
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,033
back-to-back or...?

402
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,099
You don't have any openings?

403
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,067
Oh, wow, that's too bad.

404
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,999
Could we

405
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,933
could we maybe get on a wait list or...?

406
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,866
She can have mine!

407
00:23:49,933 --> 00:23:51,033
Sorry, hold on one second.

408
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,899
What's that, Bridge?

409
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,599
My lesson.

410
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,700
She can have it.

411
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,399
It's at 4:00 tomorrow.

412
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,499
I don't want it.

413
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,900
But that's your lesson, Bridge.

414
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,000
I... don't... want it.

415
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,667
She can have it!

416
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,300
Go away. I'm busy.

417
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,233
Sorry, coming in anyway.

418
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,832
Hi.

419
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,899
Look, I know you got homework,

420
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,267
but you have to clear
something up for me.

421
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,199
I thought I heard you say
you wanted to quit clarinet.

422
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,399
Yeah, so, what's the difference?

423
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,200
I stink at it, anyways.

424
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:24,999
What are you talking about?

425
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,600
You've only been at it for two weeks.

426
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,999
Yeah, and Marie's been playing for,
like, two minutes.

427
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,799
And she's already great.

428
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,434
Come on, you can't do that.

429
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,499
You can't compare yourself to Marie.

430
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,599
I mean, I don't know what
is going on there,

431
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,100
but that girl clearly has
a special aptitude for the clarinet.

432
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,400
But I don't.

433
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,900
you are already one of the most
special people in the whole wide world.

434
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,000
Really. Now, anybody who knows
you would say that.

435
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,500
No, you're wrong.

436
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,267
Nobody's ever said that.

437
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,799
Except you.

438
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,699
Just now.

439
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,700
And only because you're my Dad.

440
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,267
I don't believe that.

441
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,899
Yeah, well, it's true.

442
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,867
You know who I am?

443
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,866
I'm everybody's sister.

444
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,466
That's not true.

445
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,900
Yeah? Well, I'm Ariel's sister,

446
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,300
because she's smart and she's pretty,

447
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,233
and everybody likes her.

448
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,899
And she knows about
clothes and-and boys and dancing.

449
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,867
And... now, I guess
I'm Marie's sister, too.

450
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,599
'Cause she can play clarinet
without even trying.

451
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,734
Come here.

452
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,000
No, it absolutely it just broke
my heart, you know.

453
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
She just seemed so defeated by it.

454
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,633
Do you hear me?

455
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,700
Allison?

456
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,635
Hey, Allison?

457
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,299
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?

458
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,199
Where are you ?

459
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,433
What are you so busy thinking about?

460
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,233
Look, don't be mad.

461
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,500
I went to see him today.
I brought him his blanket.

462
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,399
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

463
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,999
I'm trying to talk to you
about your own child.

464
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:03,599
He had a sister.

465
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,499
Had.

466
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,934
She died a few months ago.

467
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,099
She said that Bryce
wasn't safe in that house.

468
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,667
That I shouldn't have
brought him back there.

469
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,967
What, the dead sister told you this?

470
00:26:14,034 --> 00:26:15,934
Look, I checked her death records.

471
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,799
It said "unexplained illnesses,
natural causes. "

472
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,000
Apparently, they took her
to expert after expert.

473
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,200
No one could really put
their finger on it.

474
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,099
What are you saying?

475
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,300
Well, I'm saying something's
wrong in that house.

476
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,733
The sister said that Bryce
wasn't safe there.

477
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,499
The mother said the housekeeper
lived for him.

478
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,399
So, I'm starting to think
maybe she didn't kidnap him at all,

479
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,500
maybe she was trying to protect him.

480
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,567
Maybe someone or something
in that house killed the sister,

481
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,100
and now it's trying to harm Bryce.

482
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,900
What are you doing?

483
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,399
I can't do this.

484
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,333
I can't spend another
ounce of energy on this thing.

485
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,799
I spent last night running
all over hell's half acre.

486
00:26:54,866 --> 00:26:57,166
- Hey, you asked me what was in my head.
- The little boy is home safe

487
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,666
- I'm telling you what's in my head.
- with his parents.

488
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,800
Our little girl is beside
herself in her room.

489
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,100
- Joe?
- Yeah? What?

490
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,200
You have a dream ?
What's going on, Allison?

491
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,299
That, do you hear that?

492
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,068
What? Hear what?

493
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,200
I listened for- Oh, Allison,

494
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,766
look, it's almost 1:30 in the morning.

495
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,200
No, that, that. That baby crying.

496
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,099
What are you -  there's no baby crying.

497
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,499
What are you talking about?

498
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,167
We don't have a baby.

499
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,800
It's him. It's Bryce.

500
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,933
He needs me. I'm going over there.

501
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,099
Going where?

502
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,499
To the Carlos'.

503
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,000
I need to make sure he's okay.

504
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,999
Hey! Are you listening to yourself?

505
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,600
It's the middle of the night.

506
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,899
I don't care! He's in trouble.

507
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,400
He needs me.

508
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,433
For crap's sake.

509
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:55,999
Help you?

510
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,901
Mr. Carlo...

511
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,899
We met the other day.
I was with Detective Scanlon.

512
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,067
This is my husband Joe.

513
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,599
Look, I know it's
the middle of the night;

514
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,899
I know this is really unusual,
but I was wondering

515
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,834
if I could just look in on Bryce.

516
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,499
Allison.

517
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,800
What going on?
What are you doing here?

518
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,599
This...

519
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,399
this... hard to explain.

520
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,999
I just- I need to see Bryce.

521
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,999
I need to know that he's okay.

522
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,600
Why wouldn't he be okay?

523
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,199
Oh, no, no.

524
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,700
Did we do that? The doorbell?

525
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,599
No, no, this is pretty much
par for the course.

526
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,300
Well, as long as that's the case.

527
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,066
I mean, if he's up,

528
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:35,266
is there any way that I can just see him?

529
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,733
Oh, he's such a beautiful boy.

530
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,500
Your little girl never got to meet him,
did she?

531
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:51,766
I got pregnant just before she passed.

532
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,400
I know Scott was worried
that I was so filled with grief

533
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,967
that I might lose him.

534
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,100
I can't imagine what
it would be like to go through that.

535
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,099
Well, the hardest part
was never getting any answers.

536
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,033
Never knowing what was wrong.

537
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,199
I mean, the only thing

538
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,467
everyone seemed to agree
on was that she was dying.

539
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,633
Did you ever consider getting an autopsy,
so you would know why?

540
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,234
Allison.

541
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,567
Lucy suffered too much.

542
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,900
We couldn't put her through that, too.

543
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,567
And, ultimately, an autopsy would've
just been for our benefit, not hers.

544
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,599
We just wanted her to rest in peace.

545
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,600
I just don't understand
why they wouldn't get an autopsy.

546
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,099
I mean, if one of our girls died...?

547
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,634
Allison, you have to stop.

548
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:48,000
That family opened their door
to us at 3:00 in the morning.

549
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,267
They're not evil.

550
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,633
If anything, they're saints.

551
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,099
Okay, I'm not saying they're not nice,

552
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,499
I just - I think it's strange... Strange?

553
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,600
Strange?
You want to talk about strange?

554
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,100
Look, I hate to break it to you,

555
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,300
but the only thing strange
about that house tonight

556
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,899
was the fact that we were in it.

557
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,500
Now, you have to leave that family alone.

558
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,166
I mean it.

559
00:30:13,101 --> 00:30:14,699
Go away. I'm tired.

560
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,267
Yeah, well, too bad.

561
00:30:16,334 --> 00:30:18,267
It's time to get up.

562
00:30:18,334 --> 00:30:20,400
Well, I haven't even been to sleep yet.

563
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:22,234
What are you talking about?
It's morning.

564
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,933
You've been asleep all night.

565
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,134
Not really. I've been dreaming.

566
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,367
Dreaming about that stupid song.

567
00:30:29,434 --> 00:30:31,999
What are you talking about?

568
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,999
You dream that song?

569
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,499
There's this old man and he
has a clarinet.

570
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,300
And all he does is play
that song over and over again.

571
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,934
Showed me how to do it.

572
00:30:42,001 --> 00:30:43,600
I hate it.

573
00:30:43,601 --> 00:30:45,534
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

574
00:30:45,601 --> 00:30:47,701
Why are you even telling me all this?

575
00:30:47,766 --> 00:30:50,400
Because you're my big sister.

576
00:30:56,901 --> 00:30:58,899
Allison.

577
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,100
Sir, I was wanting to ask you
about Bryce Carlo.

578
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:03,400
When you brought him in,

579
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:04,999
did anyone run any blood work,

580
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,600
anything that could test
for toxins in his system?

581
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,999
Sure.

582
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,300
Blood tests are fairly routine
in child abduction cases.

583
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,399
We look for sedatives, tranquilizers.

584
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,334
The good news is, in Bryce's case,

585
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,600
everything came back completely normal.

586
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,800
Devalos.

587
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,799
Yeah.

588
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,566
Okay.

589
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,467
I'll be right there.

590
00:31:27,534 --> 00:31:28,501
That was the morgue.

591
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,600
Seems a sanitation worker found a

592
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,900
corpse stuffed
in an abandoned refrigerator

593
00:31:33,901 --> 00:31:36,401
in one of our municipal
landfills early this morning.

594
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,100
Matches the description of our missing
kidnapper, Elizabeth Torres.

595
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,499
Yes.

596
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,799
That's her.

597
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,166
That's my cousin.

598
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,333
Thank you for coming down
and making the identification.

599
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,100
I may have a few more questions.
If want to just wait outside?

600
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,066
M.E.'s calling cause of death
blunt-force trauma.

601
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,399
Looks like she took a couple
of hard blows to the head.

602
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,601
Hard enough to kill her.

603
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,934
Doesn't make a lot of sense.

604
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,899
This woman takes a baby boy,

605
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,000
you find the baby boy,

606
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:27,000
then someone kills the kidnapper?

607
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,999
Something's missing.

608
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,799
Like what?

609
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,800
To begin with, I still can't figure out
why this woman took that child,

610
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,500
only to abandon him
at the house where Allison found him.

611
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Might make sense to have
forensics go back,

612
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,933
see if they can find any
of this woman's blood.

613
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,899
All right, girls.

614
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,500
Hey, girls, come on.

615
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,400
It's time to leave
for Marie's music lesson.

616
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,599
Hey, Dad?

617
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,533
Yeah.

618
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,700
Marie wanted me to tell you that
she doesn't want to go to her lesson.

619
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,600
What?! Why?

620
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,499
All right, sweetheart.

621
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,767
All good?

622
00:33:01,834 --> 00:33:03,834
Okay, come on.

623
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,299
She okay?

624
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,133
Well, not yet, but eventually.

625
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,900
This is one of those things, isn't it?

626
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:19,099
Yes, yes.

627
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,234
This definitely appears
to be one of those things.

628
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,799
So, how do we fix it?

629
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,767
How do we make her stop
hearing that song?

630
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:27,999
I don't know, Bridge.

631
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,933
I honestly I don't know.

632
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,700
From my experience with mom

633
00:33:31,766 --> 00:33:34,299
and with Ariel and even with you,

634
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,633
it's best to just let
these things run their course.

635
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:54,899
Hello?

636
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,900
<i>Allison, I hope I didn't wake you.</i>

637
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:58,299
I just called to let you know

638
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,400
that the police went back out to that
house where you found the Carlo boy.

639
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,400
They actually found a small spot of
blood on the underside of a doorknob.

640
00:34:05,633 --> 00:34:08,800
The blood matched some blood that
we found on Elizabeth Torres's body-

641
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,401
blood that wasn't hers.

642
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,199
So, while we don't yet have a suspect,

643
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,899
the good news is, once we do,

644
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,367
we have enough forensic evidence
to nail him for murder.

645
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,399
Anyway, I'm...

646
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,801
I'm going to go home, go to bed.

647
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,200
You do that, sir.

648
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,499
Allison.

649
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,599
It's 1:00 a. m.

650
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,600
I know, I know.

651
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:51,967
I'm sorry to have wake you and Scott.

652
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,499
Scott's not here.

653
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,800
He's out of town on business.

654
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,299
Look, I'm sorry, Dana.

655
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,800
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

656
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,100
You're a nice person.

657
00:34:59,101 --> 00:35:01,401
I need you to understand
everything that I am doing,

658
00:35:01,607 --> 00:35:03,374
I am doing for Bryce.

659
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,799
What-what are you talking about?

660
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,799
What are you doing for Bryce?

661
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,699
I hope you're not going
to ask to see him again.

662
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,299
No, I don't need to just see him.

663
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,733
I need to take him.

664
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,699
Bryce needs to be with me!

665
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,300
Okay, Allison, you need to leave.

666
00:35:14,367 --> 00:35:15,299
I'm serious.

667
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,267
You're not welcome here.

668
00:35:16,334 --> 00:35:17,700
Bryce isn't going to be with you.

669
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,367
That's just never going to happen.

670
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,199
Hi. Hello.

671
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,633
Hey, it's me. I'm fine.

672
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,399
You're fine ? You're fine?

673
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,200
Allison, I'm calling you,
like, 35 times.

674
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,799
Did you turn off your cell phone?

675
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,999
I had to throw it away.

676
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,833
I knew they were going
to use it to try to track me down.

677
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,301
Look, I just want you to know
that I'm safe.

678
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,500
I can't tell you where we are,
but we're safe.

679
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,699
But you're not.

680
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,500
The whole state of Arizona
is looking for you.

681
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,699
They got AMBER alerts and APBs.

682
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,900
I beg you, turn yourself in.

683
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,299
Now!

684
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,900
If we're lucky,
all they're charge you with is assault.

685
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,199
I can't.

686
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,699
I can't explain it.

687
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,633
It's just... I know.

688
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,932
For now he's supposed to be with me.

689
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,299
But he's not.

690
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,267
Allison, please, tell me where you are.

691
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,567
Tell me at least you have a plan.

692
00:36:13,634 --> 00:36:15,434
There's no plan.

693
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,600
He had to sleep, eat.

694
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,000
I need to sleep. Honey,
I have to get off the phone.

695
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,799
I know that they're probably
tracing our home number.

696
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,100
I love you. I love the girls.

697
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,333
I'll see you soon.

698
00:36:31,032 --> 00:36:32,800
Mirabella !

699
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:34,800
It's Elizabeth.

700
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,700
Please. I'm in trouble.

701
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,700
I need help.

702
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,400
Mirabella? ?stas en casa?

703
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,300
<i>?ola?</i>

704
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,399
Elizabeth?

705
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,400
I know you're here !

706
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,533
- Elizabeth?
- Primo !

707
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,000
<i>Primo, what are you doing here?</i>

708
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,799
What am I doing here?

709
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,599
You know exactly what I'm doing here.

710
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,499
You think you could just
cut me out of my own plan?

711
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,434
No.

712
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,200
No, you're wrong. I would never...

713
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,400
You would never what?
What, you never what?

714
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,599
No, no, I did everything you asked.

715
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,634
I gave you the alarm code.

716
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,299
I took pictures.

717
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,799
Yes, you were a good cousin.

718
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,699
You did everything you were supposed to.

719
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,134
Maybe too much.

720
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,599
No.

721
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,599
- Yes.
- No.

722
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,433
Yes. How else do you explain it?

723
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,200
This morning when Martin and I
were supposed to kidnap the baby,

724
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,799
we find out he's already gone.

725
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,867
- Alberto...
- And then the TV.

726
00:37:51,934 --> 00:37:54,200
They're saying the person
who took it was you.

727
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,567
I want that baby !

728
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,700
I'm sorry, Alberto, he's not here.

729
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,599
I don't have him anymore.

730
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,567
I gave him to Mirabella.
She's gone to the police.

731
00:38:06,633 --> 00:38:08,400
She's going to tell them everything.

732
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,299
You're lying !

733
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,400
No !

734
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,299
It's the truth.

735
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,901
I don't lie.

736
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,534
Not like you lied to me.

737
00:38:17,901 --> 00:38:19,100
Martin told me

738
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,566
he told me you were never going
to give that baby back,

739
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:23,100
even if they paid the ransom.

740
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,433
That you were going to sell him
for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

741
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,300
I could never be a part of that.

742
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
You cannot really be my cousin.

743
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,433
You are not even human.

744
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,266
Ma'am, you're under arrest.

745
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,500
I'm gonna need you to put your hands
on your head and surrender the child.

746
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:14,767
I'm so sorry that I sprayed you
in the eyes.

747
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,999
I just had a conversation
with the man you work for-

748
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,200
the district attorney.

749
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,000
He explained to me that I have
every right to prosecute you

750
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,433
for kidnapping Bryce, assaulting me.

751
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,633
Every right to send you
to prison for a very long time.

752
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,300
But...

753
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,299
...he also confessed

754
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,799
that he thought that would be
a huge mistake.

755
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,700
And then he talked to me
about you and your dreams.

756
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,500
He told me it was a dream of yours

757
00:39:49,501 --> 00:39:53,101
that led police
to the man who killed our nanny.

758
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:57,199
That once they brought him in,
he confessed.

759
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,233
He told them that after you had brought
Bryce back to me and Scott,

760
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,500
Alberto and his partner realized
they still had the alarm code.

761
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:09,234
They still had everything they needed
to go through with the kidnapping.

762
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,799
They even had my husband's
travel schedule,

763
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,001
which is why last night,

764
00:40:13,067 --> 00:40:17,034
shortly after you assaulted me
and took my son,

765
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,366
they came to my house.

766
00:40:19,433 --> 00:40:20,566
Oh, my God.

767
00:40:20,633 --> 00:40:22,099
If you hadn't taken Bryce,

768
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,899
it appears they would have.

769
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,399
They-They pulled up to our house

770
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,300
and found police cars in our driveway.

771
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,800
Police cars that were
there because of you, Mrs. Dubois;

772
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
because you'd taken my little boy.

773
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,299
Now maybe it was just a coincidence,

774
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:44,500
but I prefer to believe this...

775
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,299
this thing you have,

776
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:55,068
this gift...
it forced you to keep Bryce safe.

777
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,900
And that's what I prefer to believe.

778
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,801
You're not going to prosecute me?

779
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,899
I told your boss that my memory
of last night is faulty.

780
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,700
I'm not comfortable testifying
about what happened.

781
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,299
Oh, thank you.

782
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,600
Stay away from my house, Allison.

783
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,266
Stay away from my family.

784
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:19,299
If-If I ever see you again,

785
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,800
my memory may very well improve,
do you understand?

786
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:26,599
I understand.

787
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,799
But it's not going to be a problem.

788
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,934
I was there when Bryce needed me.

789
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,200
But I think for the rest of his life,
one mother is plenty.

790
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,467
Excuse me.

791
00:42:06,534 --> 00:42:09,234
Can u tell me the name of that song?

792
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,599
It doesn't have a name, actually.

793
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,299
I wrote it.

794
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,401
Well, me and my dad anyway.

795
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,600
I'm Mr. Bronson, by the way.

796
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,699
And who are you?

797
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,834
Bridgette Dubois.

798
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:29,067
Nice to meet you, Bridgette Dubois.

799
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,367
Yeah, this song doesn't have a name-

800
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,133
'cause it doesn't have an ending.

801
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,899
We never finished it.

802
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,699
I was working on it
with my father when he...

803
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,034
he passed away suddenly.

804
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,499
Wait right here.

805
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,667
I think I know someone
you're gonna want to meet.
