1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,900
WOMAN:
Pulse is nonexistent.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,200
Patient's in
cardiac arrest.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,800
The cranial pressure's up.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,900
I'm guessing aneurysm.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,900
You're guess aneurysm?
What does that mean?

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,400
You want us to treat
it like an aneurysm?

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,900
Where's the
attending?

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,500
We paged him.
He hasn't answered yet.

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,400
You're the resident,
so you're in charge
till he gets here.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,900
Right. Okay, we need to insert
an intraventricular catheter.

11
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,700
But that will
take hours.

12
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,200
Okay, forget that.

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,600
Let's just hit it
with the defibrillator.

14
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,600
Get the paddles fired up.

15
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,600
OLDER NURSE:
Charging to 300.

16
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,200
It's charged.

17
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,000
Clear.
Clear.

18
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,800
Okay, new plan.

19
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,500
We need to do
an intracranial bypass.

20
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,200
We'll just insert another
catheter through the groin.

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,200
Are you sure? Her brain's
not getting any oxygen.

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,400
By the time we
find the aneurysm,
she'll be a vegetable.

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,700
I think we got to call it.

24
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,500
Yeah.

25
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,900
I'm gonna call it.

26
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,600
Time of death...

27
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,600
5:14 a.m.

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,500
Time of death?

29
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,900
What are you talking
about, time of death.

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,200
Continue CPR please.

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,100
She had an aneurysm
I'm afraid.

32
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,000
She's been comatose
for several weeks.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,700
I thought about
an intracranial drain.

34
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,800
That's a waste of time.

35
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,700
This patient's not having
an aneurysm,

36
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,900
she's in anaphylaxis.

37
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,100
I don't think so.

38
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,200
There's nothing
on her chart

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,300
that says anything
about any allergies.

40
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,700
No known allergies.

41
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,700
But we changed her
antiviral this afternoon.

42
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,500
It's got Methisone in it.

43
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,500
We've got something.

44
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,200
Pulse?
Thirty-four.

45
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,500
Sixty-six.

46
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,400
BP's climbing as well.
She's stabilizing.

47
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,000
The clues are all
on the chart.

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,200
You just gotta learn
how to read it.

49
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,400
You just saved
that woman's life.

50
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,000
I suppose I did.

51
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,500
Guess it wasn't
your time to go...

52
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,200
Allison Dubois.

56
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,700
How come you never told me?
I don't know.

57
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,500
But in light of everything
that's happened since,

58
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,700
it seemed kind
of beside the point.

59
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,600
Almost dying?

60
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,500
How can that ever be
beside the point?

61
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,100
I don't know, I wasn't there.

62
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,200
From what the doctors told me,

63
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,000
the whole thing lasted
maybe two minutes.

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,400
I mean, they called me,
I rushed down there.

65
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,100
By the time I got
down there, you were
completely stable.

66
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,300
I never even met the
doctor who worked on you.

67
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,200
Still...

68
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
But, Allie, you were
in a coma.

69
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,300
You were in a coma when
I left you that night.

70
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,100
You were still in a coma when
I came back the next morning.

71
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,000
It didn't seem like
that much had changed.

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,200
But I'm sorry.

73
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,700
You don't have to apologize.

74
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,300
It's not your fault.

75
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,900
I just-- the whole reason
I'm dreaming this dream

76
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,200
is I'm anxious about
going back to the hospital.

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,700
I'm anxious about
seeing Rosemary.

78
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,800
What are you
anxious about?

79
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,600
She's your friend.

80
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,100
Why are you
assuming the worst?

81
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,900
Honey, it's a hospital.

82
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,900
They don't keep
you in there 'cause
they like you.

83
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,900
Aren't you
forgetting something?

84
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,200
And then this guy Jordy,
after all that,

85
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,900
tells her he doesn't
even like girls.

86
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,400
He likes boys.

87
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,500
Bridgette, why are you
watching that show?

88
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,900
Mom and Dad would hate it

89
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,600
if they knew that you were
watching that show.

90
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,400
Nuh-uh.

91
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,200
You're wrong.

92
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,800
It's not even a show.
It's all real.

93
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,500
It's reality television.

94
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,300
Okay, you know what,
you don't know what
you're talking about.

95
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,200
There is nothing real
about that show.

96
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,400
It's staged.

97
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,300
The people who make it
tell them what to do.

98
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,200
Nuh-uh. It's real.

99
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,100
It's fake.

100
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,000
You're wrong.
It has to be real.

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I watched it on the computer
at school.

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,200
What did you watch
on the computer at school?

103
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
She's watching that show,
 <i>The Real Life Diaries.</i>

104
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,800
The one where the
follow real people

105
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
with the real problems,

106
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,700
finding real solutions to
life's real challenges.

107
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,100
No, no, no, Bridge.

108
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,300
I don't want you
watching that.

109
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,400
That's not for you.

110
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,600
Why is it not for me?

111
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,800
I'm a person--
I'm real.

112
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,500
Yes, but there's
nothing real
about that show.

113
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
She's right.

114
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,500
It's all so lurid and adult.

115
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,400
I want to be an adult.

116
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,800
And I don't know
what it means,

117
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,000
but by the sound of it,

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,700
I think I want
to be lurid, too.

119
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,800
Yeah, me, too.

120
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
What you want to be
is on time for school.

121
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
And I want to be on time
for my job interview.

122
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,500
So if you guys are done
with your breakfast,

123
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,600
how about you go into your room
and get ready for school, okay?

124
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,500
Okay, Daddy.
Thank you.

125
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,800
Okay, Daddy.

126
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,600
Oh, hey...
when you see your mom,

127
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,000
be sure to make a big deal.

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,900
She's walking without a cane.

129
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,100
Yeah.

130
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,800
We're decent.

131
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,400
I'm calling no fair.

132
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,300
(laughing):
Look at you.

133
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,300
Thank you.

134
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,400
What's with the hair?

135
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,600
I thought we
had a deal.

136
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,600
I just got rid of mine
to support you.

137
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,100
If I had known you were
going to grow yours back,

138
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,700
I would have stopped
taking that chemo a long time ago.

139
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,500
I feel like such a fool.

140
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,700
I got out my best
babushka for your visit.

141
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,000
And seriously, you're not using
your cane at all anymore?

142
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,300
No, not as of this morning.

143
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,100
You're just...

144
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,000
a disappointment
on so many levels.

145
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,400
After all I've done for you.

146
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,000
Don't make fun.
Don't belittle.

147
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,200
No.

148
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,500
No, might not be
important to you,

149
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,300
but it's important to me.

150
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,500
You're the one
who got me through

151
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,000
those first few weeks,
you smart-ass.

152
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,400
You're the one who would
come up to me and say,

153
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,300
"get your ass out of bed."

154
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,600
Okay.

155
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,700
So...

156
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,700
return the favor.

157
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,100
Get your ass out of bed.

158
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,700
Well, I guess you just don't know how to say it right, do you?

159
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,100
Rosemary, what the hell is
going on?

160
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,700
Why are you still here?

161
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,700
Yesterday afternoon,

162
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,300
my doctor told me
I'm stage four.

163
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,600
Can't operate again.

164
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
It's too big.

165
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,700
It's too impacted.

166
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,500
I'm so sorry.

167
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,700
That's what he told me.

168
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,600
Do you know what I did?

169
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,100
I didn't call my family.

170
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,000
I didn't call my minister.

171
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,700
The first person I called
was you.

172
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,100
Yesterday afternoon.

173
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,400
You.

174
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,800
And here you are.

175
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,700
Here I am.

176
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,100
So how you sleeping?

177
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,800
You're walking.

178
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
You've got hair to comb.

179
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,500
I'm thinking
you're dreaming again.

180
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,400
So dream a dream for me.

181
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,200
Dream me something I
can tell my husband; my kids.

182
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,000
Would you do that?

183
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,900
A happy dream?
A hopeful dream?

184
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
I'll try.

185
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,000
I swear to God, I will try.

186
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,500
But it kind of does
what it wants to do.

187
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,000
That's okay.

188
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,200
If you come up empty,

189
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,000
feel free to come back tomorrow
and lie to me.

190
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,700
I'll be right there.

191
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,700
Excuse me? Uh...

192
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,200
it's Doctor...

193
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,000
Dr. Statler?

194
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,900
Yeah. I'm sorry. Have we met?

195
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,800
Uh, kind of.

196
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,000
My name's Allison Dubois.

197
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,400
I was a patient here.

198
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
Uh, I was in a coma
for about three months.

199
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,600
And I, I had a bad reaction
to a drug one night.

200
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,500
I guess, clinically, I was dead
for a few minutes.

201
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,800
Yeah, I-I remember.

202
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,900
I think I gave you an epi shot.

203
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,000
Well, any other doctor would
have done the same thing.

204
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,800
Well, I'm not so sure.

205
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,400
And, anyway, it wasn't
any other doctor.

206
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,500
It was you.

207
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,800
I promise you:

208
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,500
I only get less impressive
the more you look at me.

209
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,500
Look, I know you're
a very busy man.

210
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,400
If there's anything,
ever, that you need--

211
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,500
not that I know
what that would be...

212
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,300
You wouldn't have a nickel,
would you?

213
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,100
Yes.

214
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,500
Here you go.

215
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,700
(chuckles)
We'll call it even, huh?

216
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,800
Sorry about that.

217
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,300
Job interviews.

218
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,200
I... I get pretty nervous.

219
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,300
Would-Would you
give me that?

220
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,000
Thank you.

221
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,100
I just-- I just dried them off
and look at them.

222
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,000
They're already soaking wet
with sweat.

223
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You know what you
should do?

224
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,800
You should get a
bottle of water.

225
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,100
And just keep your hands
wrapped around it

226
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,300
till before you go
in the interview.

227
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,300
And that way your hand
will be, uh, cool

228
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,400
instead of clammy.
Oh, thanks.

229
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,800
I speak from
experience.

230
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah, I'm, uh,
Will... Willem Wittmar.

231
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,400
Joe Dubois.

232
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
That-- you're right.

233
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,300
That hand is cool.

234
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,200
Willem, huh?

235
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,900
Like, uh, like the actor?

236
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,800
Yeah.

237
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,500
I, uh, really should change it
to "William."

238
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,600
'Cause, uh, nobody ever
gets it right.

239
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,300
Here you go, Willem.

240
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,100
I think you could
probably use that.

241
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,600
Hey, Dad.

242
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,400
Hi, kiddo.

243
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,000
Hey, do you know
anybody in Hollywood?

244
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,300
Hollywood? Like in
the entertainment business?

245
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,000
No. Why?

246
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,800
I have this really cool idea
for that TV show

247
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,500
 <i>The Real Life Diaries.</i>

248
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,700
And I was thinking

249
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,700
if I wrote it down,
maybe you could send it to them

250
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,100
or write to them
or e-mail to them

251
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,700
or something.

252
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,300
It's about this new character,
a guy named Willem.

253
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,700
Willem?

254
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,700
What's so funny?

255
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,900
Bridgette.
She's, uh, she wrote some ideas

256
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,400
for this TV show she likes.

257
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,300
Well, why's that?

258
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,600
(chuckling):
I don't know.

259
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,900
She-she wants me to send it
to the producers.

260
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,700
Ooh, I like it.
Shows initiative.

261
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,900
Yeah.

262
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,700
She's created all
these characters.

263
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,300
She's got this guy
named Willem

264
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,300
who, he's an astronaut,

265
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,200
and he hasn't been
in space in, in, like,

266
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,700
a couple years,
so he's running
out of money.

267
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,700
And his wife Tess is,
uh, she's upset with him,

268
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,300
so she socks him
in the eye.

269
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,600
Whoa. Wonder where
she got that from.

270
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,000
I know.
You haven't socked me

271
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,600
in the eye for months.

272
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,100
Oh, hey, you never
said anything about,

273
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,400
um, about Rosemary.

274
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,400
What's there to say?

275
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,300
I was right.
She doesn't have much time.

276
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,700
I'm sorry.

277
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,500
The whole thing's
so random.

278
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,400
My tumor's benign,
hers was malignant.

279
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,100
I gonna live and...

280
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,800
she's gonna die.

281
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,200
Help me!

282
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,500
Oh, my God, Rosemary,
I was so worried about you.

283
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,400
I tried to call your room,
and nobody answered.

284
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,700
The nurse--

285
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,900
she told me she would make me
feel better, feel good.

286
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,100
She told me to relax.

287
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,600
She said she did this kind
of thing all the time.

288
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,100
She knew what she was doing.

289
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,100
What do you mean?
Why are you so upset?

290
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,400
Ma'am,
can I help you?

291
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,200
No, I'm fine. We're fine.

292
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm just visiting my friend.

293
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,100
Your friend?

294
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,700
Rosemary. Rosemary Widdick.

295
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,800
I don't understand.

296
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,100
Didn't they tell you?

297
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,800
Ms. Widdick passed away
early this morning.

298
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I don't understand
exactly what it is

299
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,400
you want me to do, Allison.

300
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,400
I don't know-- investigate;
file charges.

301
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,600
Help me find and arrest this
nurse that I saw in my dream.

302
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,700
But the death certificate
clearly indicates

303
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,900
that your friend died
from natural causes:

304
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,600
"Sudden respiratory failure."

305
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,000
I have to believe that
if some nurse did give

306
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,100
your friend a drug
that killed her,

307
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,800
there would be evidence
to that effect

308
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,600
and that it would be apparent
to either her doctor

309
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,800
or the people at the hospital...

310
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,500
Well, not necessarily; not if
they're not looking for it.

311
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,700
Can't you just order an autopsy?

312
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,400
Based on what?

313
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,600
Look... I'm sorry
you lost your friend,

314
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,500
but she was battling
stage-four cancer.

315
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,000
That's not what killed her.

316
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,800
Even if you're right
about that,

317
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,400
my hands are tied.

318
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,900
No crime
has been reported.

319
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,100
Even the family of
the alleged victim
isn't complaining.

320
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,100
The hospital has ruled
on the cause of death.

321
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,000
If you want someone
to revisit <i>that</i> judgment,

322
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,000
you're going to have
to convince someone there.

323
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,500
Dr. Statler?

324
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,200
Hello again.

325
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,400
Allison Dubois.
We--

326
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,500
I saved your life.

327
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,000
You gave me a nickel for it.

328
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,900
I'm sorry. I'm really busy.

329
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,700
Is there something
I can do for you?

330
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,500
There's nothing out of
the ordinary in this chart.

331
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,000
Well, of course not.

332
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,400
The drug responsible for ending
my friend's life wouldn't have

333
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,500
been recorded on that chart.

334
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,100
That's why I need you
to authorize an autopsy.

335
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,300
Look, I think
that Rosemary met with foul play.

336
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,700
That's, uh, that's quite

337
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,600
an outrageous accusation,
Mrs. Dubois.

338
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,900
Do you have
any basis for it?

339
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,100
No.

340
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,900
I'm just taking
Rosemary's word for it.

341
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,100
Look...

342
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,400
I know you're very busy

343
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,400
and I know you're very good
at what you do,

344
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,900
but it just so happens I'm
pretty good at what I do, too.

345
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,100
Look me up.

346
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,600
Here's my card.

347
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,600
Call me.

348
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,000
Tell me you'll do it.

349
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,000
Hey, Joe.

350
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,700
Looks like we both made it
to round two.

351
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,100
Must have been that
water bottle trick.

352
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,200
How's the other guy look?

353
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,400
Oh, this?
No, there was no other guy.

354
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,200
I woke up in the middle
of the night

355
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,800
and you know,
I tripped over my dog

356
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,500
and I went smack into the
the bathroom door.

357
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,600
My wife actually,
she tried to convince me

358
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,300
to use some of makeup
to cover it up, but...

359
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,000
Your wife... Tess?

360
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,600
Yeah. Did-did I mention
her the other day?

361
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,000
Yeah, Tess, she, uh,
she tried

362
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
to get me to use something
called "concealer."

363
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,300
I mean, have you heard
of this stuff?

364
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,600
It's, it's...
What's that say about women

365
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,700
that they carry around
this stuff called concealer?

366
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,300
Go away!

367
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,600
JOE:
Hey.

368
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,800
Oh. Sorry, I thought
you were Marie.

369
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,900
Ah, that's okay .

370
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,800
Um, what you, uh,
what you doing?

371
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,100
You working on some ideas
for the TV show?

372
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,000
Well, I had a dream
about them last night,

373
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,600
and I've been waiting all day
to write them down.

374
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Are you mad?

375
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,500
No, I'm not mad.
(splutters)

376
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,700
So what's going on?

377
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,100
What's in store
for ol' Willem, hmm?

378
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,700
Are things gonna start
looking up for the guy?

379
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,500
Is he gonna get some work?

380
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,000
Wait. I don't understand.

381
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,600
So your competition
for this job is some

382
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,300
down-on-his-luck astronaut

383
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,400
who has a ex-countess
for a wife? (laughs)

384
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,200
Well, Bridgette did take some
creative liberties,

385
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,600
but she also got
a lot of things right.

386
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,600
This guy Willem <i>is</i> out of work.

387
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,400
He <i>is</i> married
to a woman named Tess.

388
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,900
And, as far as I can tell,
she did sock him in the eye.

389
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,600
"Tess wanted money.

390
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,300
"It was all she ever
really cared about.

391
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,000
"And when Willem
couldn't give her enough,

392
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,600
"she found herself another man.

393
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,500
His name was Carlo."
(laughs)

394
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,700
What? So are we supposed to believe
that this lady is cheating

395
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,600
on her husband
'cause he can't find a job?

396
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,900
I mean,
nobody can find a job.

397
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,200
Hello?

398
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,400
STATLER:
I looked you up, Mrs. Dubois.

399
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Apparently you are usually
pretty good at what you do.

400
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,800
So I called the Widdick family;
I was able to convince them

401
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,900
to let us perform
an autopsy on Rosemary.

402
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,700
I'm looking
at the results right now.

403
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,900
That's terrific.

404
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah, well, you tell me.

405
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,800
We found no unusual substances
in her system,

406
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,700
just the medication
we prescribed.

407
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,300
We did find that her cancer had
spread even further

408
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,000
than her primary oncologist
suspected.

409
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,300
Her kidneys were
pretty much gone.

410
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,800
Her heart valves were not clear

411
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,100
and her lymphatic system was
compromised.

412
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,600
Mrs. Dubois,
I-I don't know what to tell you,

413
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,400
but this woman died because her
body was consumed with cancer,

414
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,000
not because someone gave her
a drug that killed her.

415
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,600
I'm just surprised.

416
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,300
Mrs. Dubois, I'm sorry
you lost your friend.

417
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,500
Perhaps knowing that she died
of natural causes

418
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,700
will make it easier
to accept.

419
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,500
Thank you.

420
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,700
Help me!

421
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,700
It hurts!

422
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,100
Pain!

423
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,400
Don't worry...
I've already given you something

424
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,600
that's gonna make all
of that go away.

425
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,100
Dr. Bench prescribed
something new.

426
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,800
It's very powerful stuff.

427
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,600
Trust me.

428
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,100
Try and relax.

429
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,900
You're not the first patient
I've administered this to.

430
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,600
That's it.
Get some sleep.

431
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,200
It's all right, dear.

432
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,300
It's your time.

433
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,000
What's so riveting, hmm?

434
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,700
Ooh, isn't that
handsome Dr. Statler,

435
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,000
the man who saved your life?

436
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,700
He did.
He saved my life,
didn't he?

437
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,900
Mm-hmm, yes, he did.

438
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,100
Why?

439
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,000
I've been up here 4:00
in the morning,

440
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,800
trying to read
everything I can about him,

441
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,700
trying to convince myself.

442
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,600
Is there something
you want to tell me?

443
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,300
I think he killed Rosemary.

444
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,100
I think he did
it on purpose.

445
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,100
Wait a second.

446
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,600
Didn't you say a nurse did it?

447
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,500
You said that you saw
a nurse doing it.

448
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,900
I said Rosemary saw a nurse
do it.

449
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,700
I think she-she thought she did.

450
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,600
But as it turns out,

451
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,600
the nurse was just giving her
a painkiller.

452
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,400
Statler slipped in there later
and killed her in her sleep.

453
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,500
At least that's what I dreamt.

454
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,400
Well, why don't we talk
about that for a second?

455
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,700
You just started dreaming again,

456
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,800
after being
in a coma for months,

457
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,300
after weeks of having
no dreams at all.

458
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,700
Is it possible that...

459
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,200
what you saw
didn't happen?

460
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,500
I... That's what
I'm hoping.

461
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
I would love
to be wrong.

462
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,400
Anyway, you know
what, this--

463
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,200
I think you got some
e-mail or something.

464
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,700
This mail symbol
keeps flashing.

465
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,000
Hey, uh, I hate to shatter
a horrible mood

466
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,500
with good news, but it's Drew.

467
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,400
He said the interview
went great.

468
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,900
They love me.

469
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,200
They're putting together
an offer.

470
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,600
I might have a job.

471
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,410
Michael Crawford,340...

472
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,200
Mr. Carlisle.

473
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,910
Sorry to shanghai you after your lunch.

474
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,710
Um,my name's Allison Dubois.

475
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,510
I'm with the district attorney's office.

476
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,980
I was also a patient here.

477
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,570
I was hoping maybe I could have a few minutes of your time.

478
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,210
<i>That's quite a story.</i>

479
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,470
I want you to understand that

480
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,180
I admire Dr. Statler.

481
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,700
I-- Dr. Statler saved my life.

482
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,670
But I've been doing research

483
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,340
on his career this morning and--

484
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:32,970
Are you aware

485
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,230
that before Dr. Statler came to work here,

486
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,290
you never had more than nine deaths a year

487
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,030
from sudden respiratory failure?

488
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,400
Sudden respiratory failure.

489
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,810
It's what's listed here

490
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,270
on my friend Rosemary's death certificate.

491
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,940
It's kind of a catchall phrase,right?

492
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,920
Basically means "We really don't know what happened here."

493
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,680
Medicine is still as much an art as it is a science.

494
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,320
And yes,sometimes it can be difficult

495
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,220
to pinpoint a precise cause of death.

496
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,400
But that doesn't mean there's any question about

497
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,510
whether the cause was natural or not.

498
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm sorry,Mrs. Dubois, your point?

499
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,580
My point is,after Dr. Statler came to work for you,

500
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,210
the number of deaths you had attributed to

501
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,550
sudden respiratory failure went from nine a year to 20.

502
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,210
That's just in his first year.

503
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,320
Twenty-- 20 deaths.

504
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,680
And almost all of them in the oncology ward.

505
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,710
And the year after that, there were 25.

506
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,530
That's almost three times the national average.

507
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,000
And-and after that...

508
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,460
What are we doing here?

509
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,870
Who am I talking to?

510
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,130
Am I talking to someone from the district attorney's office

511
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,190
or a grieving friend?

512
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,740
What does it matter? I'm asking

513
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,750
if you are here in an official capacity

514
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,270
or a personal one.

515
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,230
Does the district attorney even know you're here?

516
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,660
What difference does it make?!

517
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,220
Something is wrong!

518
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,760
You need to begin an internal investigation.

519
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,800
Statler needs to know

520
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,930
that he's being watched.

521
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,960
I see.

522
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,690
Based on a morning of looking at newspaper clippings

523
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,590
and combing through Internet gossip,

524
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,750
you've decided to come over here

525
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,240
and tell me how to run my hospital.

526
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:00,890
Mr. Carlisle...

527
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,570
Mrs. Dubois,I am certain

528
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,290
that in all that research you did,

529
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,480
you must have ascertained that Thomas Statler--

530
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,000
the man who saved your life--

531
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,180
is one of the most respected oncologists in this country.

532
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,070
This is a man who has dedicated himself

533
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,600
to treating people others have deemed untreatable.

534
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:19,950
Patients of means,people who could afford to go anywhere,

535
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,550
come to this hospital because he's here.

536
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,380
Because of his reputation, because of his expertise.

537
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,770
He killed my friend.

538
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,610
I won't listen to this.

539
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,290
He killed a lot of other people.

540
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,910
I will thank you to leave my office.

541
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,500
I think you'd

542
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,970
feel differently if somebody you loved was in his care.

543
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,320
It might interest you to know that when my wife was diagnosed

544
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,740
with Hodgkin's two years ago, the only person I would allow

545
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,850
to treat her was Dr. Thomas Statler.

546
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:49,190
He kept her alive and comfortable for months,

547
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,190
longer than other doctors even suggested she'd survive.

548
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,390
So I hope you believe me when I tell you

549
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:59,840
that if you do not cease and desist with this slandering

550
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,870
of his good name and the good name of this hospital,

551
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,290
I will marshal all the resources

552
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,100
of this institution and take you to court

553
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,190
and make sure that yu and your dreams...

554
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,920
never defame anyone again.

555
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,250
Hello.

556
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,820
Oh,hey,Drew.

557
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,980
Yeah.

558
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,790
What do you mean they went another way?

559
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,760
Your e-mail said that they loved me.

560
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,860
Your e-mail said they were, they were gonna make an offer.

561
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:30,510
Hey,Dad.

562
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,210
Hi,Dad.

563
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,230
Okay.

564
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,520
Hi,Dad. Hi,Dad.

565
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,160
All right,okay. No,no,no,I'm not...

566
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,450
Hi,Dad. Hi,hi,hi,hi,sweetie.

567
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,190
Come on.

568
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,820
Sorry,my kids. Yeah.

569
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,340
No,I'm not thrown.

570
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,240
I know it's-it's just a numbers game.

571
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,770
Yeah,the trick is to get on out there.

572
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,680
Is everything okay?

573
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,450
Yeah,everything's fine.

574
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,630
I just didn't get that, uh,job that I was after.

575
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,390
That's so weird.

576
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,870
Willem got his.

577
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,000
What do you mean "Willem got his"?

578
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,860
Well,I had a dream last night.

579
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,380
Willem was getting

580
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,000
really close to this big job at NASA,but he was up against

581
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,440
this other astronaut, this guy Joey.

582
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,160
And the other astronaut--

583
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,130
Joey?

584
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,580
Are you serious?

585
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,040
What? That's his name.

586
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,600
The other astronaut was supposed to get the job,

587
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,080
but Willem knew that his wife Tess wasn't gonna like that.

588
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,740
So he called his friend Carlo.

589
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,750
Carlo's... Wait,stop.

590
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,590
I thought Carlo was the guy who was going over to

591
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,430
see Tess when Willem wasn't home.

592
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,360
He is,but Willem doesn't know that.

593
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,420
He and Carlo have been friends forever.

594
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,890
So,Carlo's an astronaut,too.

595
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,690
And Willem asked Carlo to call NASA and tell the people there

596
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,010
that Joey is a really bad astronaut.

597
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,450
Son of a...

598
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,740
What in God's name gives you the right to judge me?

599
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,810
Dr. Statler. How dare you suggest

600
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,340
to the man who runs my hospital

601
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,670
that I would do anything but deliver the finest,

602
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,430
most humane care to my patients.

603
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,330
Dr. Statler,can we talk about this in private?

604
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,850
Where are you going?

605
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,650
I'm still talking to you!

606
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:13,800
Don't you dare walk away from me

607
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,480
while I'm speaking to you or I...

608
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,760
Or you'll what?

609
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,120
You'll decide to put me down?

610
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,820
That's what you do, isn't it?

611
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,680
You decide who gets to live or die,

612
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,480
you decide who gets care and who doesn't.

613
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,540
You know,there's another word for that.

614
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,010
It's "murder."

615
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,880
I think you murdered my friend.

616
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,620
I think you murdered a lot of other people.

617
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,850
Really?

618
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
Is that how you call it?

619
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,020
Is that what you think of it?

620
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,450
Well,then,you've never been sick.

621
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,580
Not really sick.

622
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,810
Lying in bed watching while your fortune disappears

623
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,880
and your family withers

624
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,700
because there's no one there with the intelligence

625
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,550
or the courage to make the difficult decisions

626
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,430
that need to be made in such a circumstance;

627
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,780
decisions that we've consigned to

628
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,270
insurance companies and hospital boards

629
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,070
and other anonymous groups who never need to look the patient

630
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,610
or their loved ones in the eye

631
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,600
and explain why they would prolong suffering

632
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,220
when there's no hope of recovery.

633
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,320
You judge me because I'm willing to do things that others won't?

634
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,270
Because I'm willing to entertain mercy.

635
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,130
Not murder.

636
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,900
Mercy.

637
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,330
There was nothing merciful about what you did to my friend.

638
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,780
Your friend was already dead.

639
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,290
All that was left for her is to sit

640
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,950
and watch her body decay while her brain atrophied.

641
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,640
She wasn't ready to die.

642
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,750
That was her decision to make, not yours.

643
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,220
Sorry. I beg to differ.

644
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,460
She wasn't qualified to make that decision.

645
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,610
She lacked the intelligence and the experience.

646
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,360
Unlike you. Unlike me.

647
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,570
The fact that you get sick does not mean

648
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,080
you have a full understanding of what sickness really is.

649
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,240
The sad truth of it is,

650
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,340
is that nowadays, if you have enough money,

651
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,650
you can keep almost anyone alive.

652
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,140
But the question is,can they live?

653
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,290
I asked myself that question

654
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,750
that night I walked into your room.

655
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,950
I considered your age,

656
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,330
your health up until that point,

657
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,880
the amount of time you'd been flatlining,

658
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,250
and I saved your life.

659
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,670
Hope you're not going to make me regret that decision.

660
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,250
 <i>You know,I don't begrudge you</i>  <i>your outrage,</i>

661
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,050
but...

662
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,600
just to keep things in perspective,

663
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,820
it's not like he's killing anybody

664
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,530
who isn't already at death's door.

665
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,690
Are you actually defending him?

666
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,060
No,no,no, absolutely not.

667
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,120
This guy-- he's clearly a sociopath.

668
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,730
I'm just trying to help you accept the fact

669
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,370
that maybe there's nothing else that you can do.

670
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,290
I mean,you told me

671
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,690
that this guy somehow manages

672
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,600
to do what he does without leaving any evidence.

673
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,050
And the hospital clearly isn't interested in,

674
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,460
you know,looking any harder into this.

675
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,360
I mean,Statler--

676
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,540
he treated the-the chief administrator's wife,right?

677
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,250
So I'm supposed to do nothing?

678
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,610
No,I'm not saying that.

679
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,850
I'm saying you've already done it.

680
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,200
You know? Maybe you gave him a good scare today.

681
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,920
Maybe that'll make him think twice

682
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,400
before he's tempted to,you know,

683
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,080
be merciful again.

684
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,920
I don't know. He didn't look scared to me.

685
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,560
I don't think he's the kind of guy who has scared on his menu.

686
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,320
<i>President George W. Bush</i>

687
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,910
is set to give his State of the Union address this evening,

688
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,950
with insiders speculating that he'll announce an increase

689
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,080
in troop levels in Afghanistan.

690
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,969
This on the heels of several I.E.D. roadside bombs...

691
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:25,340
You wanted

692
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,260
to see me,Jerry?

693
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,350
Yeah.

694
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,520
Come on in. Close the door,please.

695
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:36,550
Jeanette Gratz over in ICU

696
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,880
sent me an e-mail today.

697
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,410
It was about you.

698
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,860
It seems that some of her nurses noticed an unusually high number

699
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:46,200
of patients succumbing to sudden respiratory failure.

700
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,310
Your patients,or patients you had access to.

701
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,360
What,you're waiting for me

702
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:56,140
to dignify this malicious gossip with a response?

703
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,000
I'm not waiting for anything.

704
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:02,690
I'm obligated,legally, to investigate any complaint

705
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,190
that calls into question the death

706
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,620
of anyone under our care.

707
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,190
Part of that obligation...

708
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,200
is to suspend your privileges

709
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,090
while we get to the bottom of this.

710
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,380
You're suspending me?

711
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,970
I'm the head of Oncology.

712
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,210
How can you suspend me?

713
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,620
It's already done.

714
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,640
As of tomorrow morning,

715
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,020
your surgeries are cancelled,

716
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,700
your recuperating patients have been assigned

717
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,100
to other doctors in the unit.

718
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,350
If the investigation turns up nothing,

719
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,260
you'll be immediately reinstated...

720
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,620
if you choose to stay.

721
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,850
How much debt are you in,Jerry?

722
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,580
Don't make a bad situation worse,Tom.

723
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,310
How much does a man in your position make?

724
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,470
Do you pull down a tenth of what I do?

725
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,660
A twentieth?

726
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,210
I heard you asked Micah Reese

727
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,530
over at Pediatrics for a loan-- $50,000.

728
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,420
You might want to take note

729
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,930
of where your feet are, Dr. Statler.

730
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,650
The ice is getting awfully thin.

731
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,800
I was just thinking what a shame it was

732
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:12,470
that,uh,my privileges are null and void

733
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,980
when you and your wife need me more than ever.

734
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,190
My wife?

735
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,450
What are you talking about?

736
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,630
Well,I seem to remember that Deborah came in

737
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,370
for treatment last year.

738
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,790
A slight melanoma.

739
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,560
I know this is a personal question,

740
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:28,770
but I'm curious:

741
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,580
How much life insurance do you have on her?

742
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,090
What are you...?! We all go

743
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:34,670
to the Christmas parties, Jerry.

744
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:35,900
We all know what happens

745
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,700
when Deborah has one cocktail too many,

746
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,960
three cocktails too many, five cocktails too many.

747
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,850
We all know that over the years, she's distinguished herself

748
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,970
with her,uh,willingness to sleep with any physician

749
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,230
who would pay for a hotel room.

750
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,480
How dare you.

751
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,480
Now,the thing about life insurance is...

752
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,180
you have to buy it before

753
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,210
a life-threatening condition is discovered.

754
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,380
Let's say,if you went out and bought a rather large policy

755
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,590
on your wife today,

756
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,560
if I were to bring her back in for further tests,

757
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,270
if I were to find that the melanoma hadn't recurred,

758
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,410
but that it developed into something more serious--

759
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,810
lymphoma,perhaps--

760
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,970
well,then I'd have to recommend

761
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,430
that she be admitted to the hospital.

762
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,690
And I know that is a very scary thought.

763
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:20,160
Especially given the unusually high rate of mortality

764
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,510
among my patients.

765
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:28,370
Of course,that's all moot since I don't have any privileges.

766
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,310
The facts are not in dispute here.

767
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,940
We have had numerous fatalities in the oncology ward.

768
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:44,050
But it is,after all, an oncology ward.

769
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,380
These are some of the sickest patients

770
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,080
in the entire hospital population.

771
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:51,170
The survivability rate is the lowest of any single ward

772
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,540
in the hospital. This is expected.

773
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,370
And while the number of deaths

774
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,800
from respiratory failure are statistically improbable,

775
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,220
they're certainly not impossible.

776
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,670
They're certainly not unprecedented.

777
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,640
Mr. District Attorney, I promise you,

778
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,750
I've been through all of this

779
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,570
since your colleague came to see me.

780
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,620
And I am convinced what we're looking at

781
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,580
is a statistical anomaly.

782
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,830
Not the result of some sort of killing spree

783
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,780
by a sociopathic physician.

784
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,120
I'm sorry,there just isn't any indication

785
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,510
that Dr. Statler's been indulging

786
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,170
in the kind of behavior Mrs. Dubois keeps accusing him of.

787
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,230
I appreciate your candor, Mr. Carlisle,

788
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,970
but I didn't ask you down here today

789
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,660
to discuss Dr. Statler's involvement

790
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,110
in this rash of deaths.

791
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,180
You didn't?

792
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,780
Then what am I doing here?

793
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,800
To discuss your involvement.

794
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,060
My involvement?

795
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,040
That's right.

796
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,160
Before her death, your wife Deborah...

797
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,030
was being treated by Dr. Statler,wasn't she?

798
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:47,960
Yes.

799
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,040
Where are we going with this?

800
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:54,030
Well,I'd just like to know why you referred her to Dr. Statler,

801
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,230
even though a source tells me that you received a number

802
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,920
of e-mails from hospital staff laying out their suspicions

803
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,670
about his practices, in great detail.

804
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,490
You're talking about hospital gossip.

805
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:06,260
Dr. Statler's the best oncologist in this state.

806
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,570
Even though you were very busy transferring everyone

807
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,070
who complained about the good doctor to other hospitals,

808
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,740
you still found time to purchase a few life insurance policies

809
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:17,840
on your wife before she went to go see Statler.

810
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,090
It's almost as if you knew that he was going to tell her

811
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,520
that the melanoma was back.

812
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,770
That she'd require surgery.

813
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,860
And that she wouldn't be coming home.

814
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,350
Do you think I murdered my wife?

815
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,740
I hope you've got more than nurses' chatter to back that up.

816
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,070
That's a warrant

817
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,540
allowing us to seize your computer.

818
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,700
My people are quite good

819
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,880
at finding deleted files and e-mails.

820
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,060
Once we're able to prove that you were aware

821
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:48,590
of the hospital staff's suspicions of his practices,

822
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,290
and that you still put your wife into his care,

823
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,360
well,at that point, I'll be ready

824
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,080
to take my chances in court.

825
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,470
Or perhaps you would like to take care of this today.

826
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,710
Agree to testify against Statler.

827
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,250
If you're willing to tell us everything

828
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,640
about the deal the two of you struck,

829
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,380
then I'm willing to make a deal with you.

830
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,260
But you should know, this is a limited-time offer.

831
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,380
Once we find what I think we're going to find in that computer,

832
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,280
then my willingness to bargain goes away.

833
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,190
Should take us about a day

834
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,170
to get through those files, Mr. Carlisle.

835
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,850
So,please... give it some thought.

836
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,150
Nice window.

837
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,470
Thanks.

838
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,740
Uh,sorry for beating you out for the job.

839
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,830
So,uh,wh-wh-what are you doing down here?

840
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,760
Well,I was just running some errands

841
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:39,760
in the neighborhood.

842
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:41,220
I thought I'd say congratulations.

843
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,220
Thanks.

844
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,680
Just one quick question before I go.

845
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,970
Um,do you know a guy named Carlo Carcetti?

846
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,520
He works for my old firm, Aerodytech.

847
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,720
Yeah,sure.

848
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:56,540
Carlo and I went to graduate school together. Why?

849
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,750
Well,you know,it's weird.

850
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,040
I never met the guy.

851
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:04,610
He started at Aerodytech a couple weeks before I left,

852
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,890
but I hear that he called this place and told them

853
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,880
that I botched a big project.

854
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,500
Really?

855
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,500
That's what I hear.

856
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,970
That-That would be a really low thing for someone to do.

857
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,460
You'd have to be willing to give up every principle you ever had.

858
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,390
I mean,you'd have to be desperate.

859
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,590
Out of work for so long, you almost can't remember

860
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,320
what it's like to have a job.

861
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,780
So broke your,uh, marriage is falling apart.

862
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,320
Right.

863
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,740
Uh,look,are you going to make a thing out of this?

864
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,390
'Cause I'm not going to just quit.

865
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,000
I really need this.

866
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,510
Frankly,I need this more than I need to be able

867
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,300
to look at myself in the mirror.

868
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,790
Hey,hey. Relax.

869
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,530
I hear they're paying you squat.

870
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,510
And I hear that this place is going to go out of business

871
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,310
in a year,if they don't get bridge funding.

872
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,990
So... it's okay. Job's yours.

873
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,480
So,what do you want?

874
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,870
Why did you come down here?

875
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,900
Believe it or not,I came here to give you a heads up.

876
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,410
You might want to have a conversation

877
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:22,080
with Carlo about his,uh, friendship with your wife.

878
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,750
I think that Carlo might have his own reasons

879
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,550
for wanting you out of the house five days a week.

880
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,870
What's that supposed to mean?

881
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,220
Well,you're going to have to figure that out by yourself,

882
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,950
'cause I got to go look for a job.

883
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,560
Hey!

884
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,570
Hey.

885
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,970
Whatcha doin'?

886
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,580
Cleaning out the garage.

887
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,720
I'm still officially looking for work,

888
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,800
officially unemployed,

889
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,560
and cleaning out the garage is

890
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,830
what the officially unemployed do.

891
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,920
So,I'm doing it.

892
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,700
Oh,you're going to get another interview.

893
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:57,800
You'll get a job.

894
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:58,720
I know.

895
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,750
You know that from Bridgette?

896
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,100
No,no,no.

897
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,670
My headhunter called.

898
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:06,440
He,uh,just wanted to reassure me

899
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,300
that he's out hunting heads.

900
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,360
Well,it may be the light in here,

901
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,820
but you actually look kinda happy.

902
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,770
I am. I am happy,Joe.

903
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,530
The guy who runs the hospital is

904
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,160
going to come in tomorrow to give a statement.

905
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,550
He's going to bring his lawyer in.

906
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,190
So,Devalos thinks that means

907
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,850
that he's ready to cut a deal.

908
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,750
I hear the police came by today.

909
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:29,670
Tom.

910
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,040
I didn't know

911
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,590
you were covering the night shift tonight.

912
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,970
I switched with Pinero.

913
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,220
So,it's true.

914
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,760
They confiscated your computer.

915
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,660
Yeah.

916
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,870
They were asking all kinds of questions.

917
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,160
They've got nothing,though.

918
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,710
Just a bunch of theories.

919
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,860
Of course they've got nothing.

920
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,230
There's no evidence of any crime.

921
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:53,300
Frankly,the only thing that can compromise me... is you.

922
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,040
Relax.

923
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,450
I didn't tell them anything.

924
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,250
Not in my best interests, either.

925
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,470
You know how I do it,Jerry?

926
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,160
How I make it seem like it's God's work

927
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,700
when one of my patients passes on?

928
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,430
Potassium.

929
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,160
Simple as that. Potassium.

930
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,240
Now,potassium levels are almost always elevated

931
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,620
after death,anyway.

932
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,340
And if you get the dosage right,

933
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,280
no one will suspect foul play.

934
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,000
They'll just assume it's some sort of...

935
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,800
Sudden respiratory failure.

936
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,000
But in your case, I think they'll go

937
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,010
for heart attack.

938
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,350
See,it presents itself differently

939
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,210
when ingested instead of injected.

940
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,170
Sometimes there's vomiting.

941
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,730
Sometimes chest pains.

942
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:49,610
Those are probably the first palpitations.

943
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,300
They're painful,but they won't last very long.

944
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,140
Time of death.

945
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:23,580
12:14.

946
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,010
Mrs. Dubois. What are you doing here?

947
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,530
I know what you did to that man.

948
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,140
Oh,maybe you do.

949
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,070
Maybe you don't.

950
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,090
Doesn't matter.

951
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,190
YOU CAN'T PROVE ANYTHING

952
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,970
All those things that you said 

953
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:50,920
about mercy, and principles--

954
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:51,930
it's all a bunch of garbage.

955
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,390
It's all a bunch of crap.

956
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,390
You're exactly what I said you were.

957
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,830
You're a murderer.

958
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,900
Don't confuse the means with the end.

959
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,570
Jerry Carlisle threatened my career.

960
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,030
I had to make a judgment call.

961
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,170
The life and career of a dedicated doctor

962
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,530
is worth more than the life and career of cuckold bureaucrat.

963
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,700
Now,I'm fully aware of how arrogant that sounds.

964
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,090
Doesn't make it any less true.

965
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,020
You don't actually think I'm going to allow you

966
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,570
to continue killing people, do you?

967
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:25,120
I am going to find a way to prove what you're doing.

968
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,410
I'm sure you'll try.

969
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,160
But,uh,if you want to keep an eye on me,

970
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,620
you're going have to move to Georgia.

971
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,510
See,there's a hospital in Atlanta

972
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,540
that's been trying to steal me for years.

973
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:39,560
I finally accepted their latest offer this afternoon.

974
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,740
I don't know,it just feels like it's time to move on.

975
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,880
Don't you think?

976
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,590
You know,that night we first crossed paths--

977
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,920
that night I treated you--

978
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,710
I had no idea what a unique talent I was preserving.

979
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,070
In spite of everything that's happened,

980
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,710
I'm glad I saved your life, Mrs. Dubois.

981
