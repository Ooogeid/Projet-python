Previously on Medium:

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,350
Name's Autumn Colville. Mother
reported her missing yesterday.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,400
The blood. And that corpse.

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,550
What corpse?

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,940
Scanlon just called. They found
the remains of Autumn Colville.

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,500
There were several more
duffel bags down there.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,120
When they opened them up,they found the
butchered body parts of two more girls.

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,370
Looks like we got
ourselves a serial killer.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,020
I got a call from Ashley's father today.

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,800
He's convinced that his daughter is
sharing her antianxiety medication with you.

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,750
There's this girl,and she won't leave me alone
and she won't let me study or concentrate...

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,510
Wait a second. Hold on. What girl?

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,690
Stacey Anne Burrows.

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,310
Stacey Anne--
is she dead?

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:51,340
We decided that if the doctor thinks that this
medicine will improve the quality of your life,

16
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,640
I will try to get that
appointment as soon as possible.

17
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,820
Allison Dubois? I'm Caitlyn Lynch.

18
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,670
I'm with the Lydecker Corporation.

19
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,190
You're offering me a job?

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,010
What exactly does it mean when
they say "high six figures"?

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,680
Means you need to call her tomorrow.

22
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,380
You need to find out
what this is all about.

23
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,850
So you think I should take it?

24
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,380
How do you not take it?

25
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,680
These are employee dossiers.

26
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,870
I'd like you to spend
some time with them.

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,600
See if there's anyone among
this group that gives you pause.

28
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,030
Well,he's really the only
person who jumped out at me.

29
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,480
And this is the only employee
that you're worried about?

30
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:27,200
He's Justin Lydecker.
Mr. Lydecker's son.

31
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,670
Your father is interested in
my impressions of things,people,

32
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,380
which is why I think he
wanted me to sit down with you.

33
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,990
Yeah. That's what I figured.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,480
He wants you to tell him if his only son
is permanently screwed up or if I can be...

35
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,850
salvaged.

36
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,840
Lee,it's me. I just had another dream.

37
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,280
I think it happened
again,another murder.

38
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,130
The dreams you've been having about the murders,did
you mention your dreams to your colleague?

39
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,650
Dreams that we're talking about
have nothing to do with Lydecker.

40
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,900
Your dreams,your impressions,they
belong to Lydecker now.

41
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,040
They are actually the intellectual
property of our company.

42
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,910
If you ever breach your contract again,

43
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:08,790
I will litigate you with a vigor unlike
anything you have ever experienced in your life.

44
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,590
Justin.

48
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,760
Justin.

49
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,480
He knows.

50
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,430
Hold on a second,wait. I'm not
following. Who-who is this "he"?

51
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,370
What is it you're saying that he knows?

52
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,950
And while we're at
it,where are you going?

53
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,250
I think I need to get dressed.
I need to go tell somebody.

54
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,420
But,Allison...

55
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,990
it's not even 6:00 in
the morning. Tell me.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,380
That maniac who's killing all those
women,gouging their eyes out,it's Justin Lydecker.

57
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,010
Justin Lydecker?

58
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,540
Douglas Lydecker's son,my boss's
son,his only son,his only child.

59
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,360
And I think he knew,or
at least he suspected.

60
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,790
I think that's why he hired me.

61
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,750
To do what? To get confirmation?

62
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,720
That,and the special added bonus
that if I ever dreamt the awful truth,

63
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,770
I couldn't do anything
with those dreams because...

64
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,850
He owns them. Your dreams are
his. That's-that's very smart.

65
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,300
Guess that's how you get
to be Douglas Lydecker.

66
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,920
So what are you gonna do?

67
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,320
I have to tell the district attorney.

68
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,410
Maybe if I hurry up,I can get
there before Devalos arrives.

69
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,170
Nobody will see me.
No one will ever know.

70
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,230
Allison.

71
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,050
Caitlyn.

72
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,430
I had a very interesting
dream about you last night.

73
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,810
You were having a conversation with your
husband about things you saw in your sleep.

74
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,370
And then you made a decision toDI cUMome here
and share what you saw with your old boss.

75
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,040
Well,then you know
everything there is to know.

76
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,330
Why don't you come in with me,and we can
talk to the district attorney together.

77
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,200
Allison,I'm not going in there.

78
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,750
And you're not going in there.
It's simply not going to happen.

79
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,200
I beg to differ.

80
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,460
Allison,if you go in that building and
have the conversation you intend to,

81
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,610
you'll be forcing Mr.
Lydecker to take legal action.

82
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,670
I'm trying to help you.

83
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,700
This is difficult for me,too.

84
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,620
Well,let me make it easier. Here,I quit.

85
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,210
It doesn't work that way.

86
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,420
Go back and read your contract.

87
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,020
Quitting doesn't release you from the
terms of our agreement. Far from it.

88
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:20,550
If you breach your contract in any way
at any time,Lydecker can and will sue you.

89
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,040
They will go after all of your assets.

90
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,610
And when those are depleted,they'll go after any
collective assets you may have with your husband.

91
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,590
I'm talking about your home,Allison.

92
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,210
I'm talking about your husband's stake
in his venture with Cavanaugh Industries.

93
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,100
I'm talking about any college fund
you may have started for your girls.

94
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,570
Allison,Lydecker has an army of lawyers.

95
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,000
And I promise you,there is nothing you
own that they won't find and take away.

96
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,140
Women are dying horrible deaths.

97
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,880
I'm aware of that.

98
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,300
Mr. Lydecker is aware of that.

99
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,390
We all want it to stop. It's
just,it cannot stop this way.

100
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:04,090
Allison,before you play fast and
loose with your family's future,

101
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,640
please,Mr. Lydecker wants to see you.

102
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,420
He wants to discuss this with you.

103
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,010
There's nothing to discuss.

104
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,170
Just hear him out.

105
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,350
Douglas is devastated about this.

106
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,880
I promise you,he is not an evil man.

107
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,260
And he has a plan on how to handle this.

108
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,360
Are you trying to tell me something?

109
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,210
The thing is,if it's something
important,I want to hear you.

110
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,710
I want to help. But if it isn't...

111
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm going to the doctor's tomorrow,and
I'm gonna try and get him to give me pills.

112
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,320
And then I won't be able to hear
you. It will be too late. So...

113
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,770
if you have something to tell me...

114
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,470
Ariel.

115
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,770
Ariel.

116
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,970
Ariel,wake up. Young lady,wake up.

117
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,290
That's better. We don't show these
videos for you to sleep through.

118
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,150
That girl,Karina Tyler,the first victim,

119
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,450
she worked here,you know.

120
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,310
A summer intern. Justin...

121
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,040
oh,he couldn't stop looking at her.

122
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,060
And when she came to
talk to me about his...

123
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,430
disturbing behavior...

124
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,400
I did what I'd always done. I
- I paid her to go away,quickly,quietly.

125
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,260
It worked with the girls he frightened
in high school,the girls he...

126
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,530
forced himself on in college.
It seemed to work with her.

127
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:00,380
But then... months later...

128
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:08,180
when I read that she had
gone missing,I couldn't...

129
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,140
I couldn't help but wonder.

130
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,740
But we weren't sure.

131
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,770
That's when I told
Mr. Lydecker about you.

132
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,030
I'd been reading about
you,hearing about you.

133
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,790
I told Mr. Lydecker that if Karina
wasn't just missing,if she were dead,

134
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,060
that she might try to
reach out through you.

135
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,570
Well,you're right.

136
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,690
There's something terribly
wrong with your son.

137
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,430
And it's up to us to stop him.

138
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,580
We have to go to the district attorney,

139
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,200
- tell him what we know.
- No,no. No.

140
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,260
It's been handled. It's being handled.

141
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,490
No,I'm sorry,Mr. Lydecker,it's
not being handled.

142
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,850
It can't be handled.

143
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,190
Your son lives to kill,and
he will kill again.

144
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,110
And now that there's no Detective AuerbacMEhDI
cleaning up after him,he will be caught.

145
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,790
You're aware of that,right?

146
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,080
He was paying a detective
to cover his tracks.

147
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,770
Detective Auerbach...

148
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,490
used to work for me.

149
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,030
He provided security for
company parties,for events.

150
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,860
And after Justin started getting
into scuffles in nightclubs,

151
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:29,040
I asked him to moonlight as Justin's
bodyguard,keep him out of trouble.

152
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,360
Are you a fan of irony,Mrs. Dubois?

153
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,310
Mr. Lydecker,I appreciate your pain.

154
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,570
But there's really only one thing to do.

155
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,100
Justin has to surrender
to the district attorney.

156
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,210
I know the district attorney.

157
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,830
I will go down there with your son.

158
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,540
I will make sure that
he is treated fairly.

159
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,750
Well,that is a very generous offer.

160
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:02,010
And it's one that I would
give serious consideration to

161
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,810
if my son were still in this country.

162
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,430
What are you talking about?

163
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,020
Justin is in a safe place.

164
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,540
He's in the care of a
physician that I trust.

165
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,290
He's begun a course of therapy
to treat Justin's condition.

166
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,330
Therapy? There is no therapy.

167
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,440
Are you aware of chemical castration?

168
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,890
It's proven very effective in the
treatment of child molesters,serial rapists.

169
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,900
His doctor is highly optimistic.

170
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,400
What about his victims?

171
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,480
There are four dead women
he has to account for.

172
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,930
The families of those
women deserve justice.

173
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,220
Yes. And they'll get it.

174
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,640
A kind of justice,anyway.

175
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,620
I've begun making anonymous
donations to their families,

176
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,160
and they'll be extremely
well compensated.

177
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,220
Mrs. Dubois,believe me
when I tell you this.

178
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:56,620
The souls of these women will
always weigh heavily on me.

179
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,840
Allison?

180
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,610
Please don't do anything foolish.

181
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,870
Like your dreams,keep this
conversation to yourself.

182
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,610
Just don't give me a reason
to behave in ways that

183
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,710
will make both of us very unhappy.

184
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,980
Well?

185
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,920
I don't know. I'm not a lawyer.

186
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,620
But this contract looks
pretty ironclad to me.

187
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:47,140
I think that the only thing
to do is to hire an attorney.

188
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,300
Even then I'm not
holding out a lot of hope.

189
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,380
I don't understand. How can
they control who I talk to?

190
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,480
I mean,as long as it's
not a competitor...

191
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,800
No,Allison...

192
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,890
Well,the way that I read that thing,I'm not even
supposed to be having this conversation with you.

193
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,890
Okay,be that as it may,if Junior really is
under a doctor's care in some foreign country,

194
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,370
then the immediate danger is gone.

195
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,520
There's really not all that
much to talk to Devalos about.

196
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,970
And as for getting you out of
there,getting you out of your contract,

197
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:17,710
I mean,I think that the only thing to do is to
start looking for an attorney in the morning.

198
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,800
I'm psychic.

199
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,040
Why didn't I see this coming?

200
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,040
- How could I have been so stupid?
- Don't do that.

201
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,720
You took the job for
all the right reasons.

202
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,260
And don't forget,you had a
lot of help. I encouraged you.

203
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,760
I pushed you to take it.

204
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,180
Come on. Let's just get some rest.

205
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,380
For one thing,we got Ariel's
doctors appointment in the morning.

206
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,920
For another,maybe it
will give us some clarity.

207
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,100
Maybe things will look a
lot better in the morning.

208
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,140
I'm not nearly as convinced
of that as you are.

209
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,560
How you feeling?

210
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,980
Like somebody drugged me and
flew me to a foreign country

211
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,040
and locked me in my room without TV.

212
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,990
Well,I am trying to save your life.

213
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,450
You're trying to save your business.

214
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,860
Daddy,you're trying to
save your reputation.

215
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,750
It's not good for the stock prices
if people read that the CEO's son

216
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:33,680
likes to julienne pretty young girls
and take their eyes as souvenirs.

217
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,590
Probably would have made for a
contentious stockholders' meeting as well.

218
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,200
Justin,do you not understand?

219
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,800
They are hours away from arresting you.

220
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,620
You have any idea what prison
would be like for someone like you?

221
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,970
Okay. All right. You just...

222
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,080
you just keep clinging to your pose and I'll
keep willing you into accepting the second chance

223
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,860
that I am giving you,whether
you want it or not.

224
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,950
- You pathetic slug.
- You're such an ass.

225
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,270
Please. Please. I can't
breathe. I can't...

226
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,170
What? He wants to live?

227
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,930
How human of him.

228
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,990
You understand about these treatments?

229
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,610
********

230
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,860
Now. In front of me.

231
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,860
The nurse says we're next.

232
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,070
- Do you hear me?
- What?

233
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,180
We're next.

234
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,880
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

235
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,030
Just something with my new job.

236
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,750
Something I have to tell my-my boss.

237
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,660
Or my boss's boss.

238
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,220
I tried to call,but couldn't get
a hold of anyone this morning.

239
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:13,120
I'm okay here if you want to
step outside and use your cell.

240
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,590
No. No,I'm fine.

241
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,590
I'm fine.

242
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,220
You want to just go?

243
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,500
What do you mean? Leave?

244
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,240
Honey,what are you talking about?

245
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,090
You waited a long time
for this appointment.

246
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,810
What about your test and your studying?

247
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,260
Ariel,it's going to be all right.

248
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,670
This doctor knows me.

249
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,170
I think he's going to understand.

250
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,960
Ariel Dubois?

251
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,970
Diane? Are you out there?

252
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,910
Why is someone knocking on my door?

253
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,550
Whoever you are,go away.

254
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,160
This is my serenity time.

255
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,300
I've been trying to get to you all day.

256
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:23,670
Sorry. I've been in
meetings. On conference calls.

257
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,970
Mr. Lydecker's out of the country,so...

258
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,970
Justin isn't taking his medication.

259
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,090
And you know this because...

260
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,950
Because I dreamt it last night.

261
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,590
He's pretending. He really
doesn't want to get better.

262
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,500
That's not possible.
His father is with him.

263
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,460
He's supervising the treatment himself.

264
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,880
He's putting on an act.

265
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,490
As soon as Mr. Lydecker leaves the room,Justin
throws his medication in the toilet.

266
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,750
Can you get me Mr. Lydecker,please?

267
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,050
You know where he is,right?

268
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,580
Tell him it's urgent.

269
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,800
- Allison?
- Yeah,I'm afraid so.

270
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,650
How do you do that?

271
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,190
How do you know the exact moment when
everything from spaghetti night is all cleaned up

272
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,610
and it's safe to come home,huh?

273
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,920
Very not funny. Bridgette
and Marie asleep?

274
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,720
Yes. Just barely. You
ever get to Lydecker?

275
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,440
No. We just kept calling and calling.

276
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,250
Finally,Caitlyn told
me just to come home.

277
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,660
That she'd keep trying till she got him.

278
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,600
I just wish I knew where
they were stashing Justin.

279
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,650
I swear to God,I would pick up the
phone and tell Devalos everything I know.

280
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:42,120
See if maybe he could make some kind of arrangement
with the authorities and bring him back here.

281
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:45,710
Hey,did you happen to pick
up that medication for Ariel?

282
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,550
Yes,indeed. All $97 worth of it.

283
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,520
Now the challenge is going
to be getting her to take it.

284
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,670
What are you talking about?

285
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,420
So,what's changed?

286
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,040
A week ago,all you could think
about was getting those pills.

287
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,510
I know.

288
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,310
You and Dad must think I'm crazy.

289
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:14,020
There's this substitute teacher
at my school,Miss Snowden.

290
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,240
And when I see her sometimes,it's
like someone's hurt her.

291
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,100
She's all bloody and cut up and...

292
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,270
She's not really.

293
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,230
Not yet,but it's like she's going to be.

294
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,670
So,is there's something we should
do? Someone I should talk to?

295
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,890
I'm afraid that if I take these pills,

296
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,140
Stacey Anne won't be able to
show me what I need to know.

297
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,890
You know that the PSATs
are the day after tomorrow?

298
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,050
I know.

299
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:53,140
And I know that these pills will
make everything I'm seeing go away.

300
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,400
And I'll be able to concentrate.

301
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,720
But if something happens
to Miss Snowden...

302
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,320
something that I could have prevented...

303
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:15,920
So,you think you could hang
onto these for a while for me?

304
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,180
Sure,honey.

305
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,790
What kind of a fool do you take me for?

306
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,980
It's time you take your medicine.

307
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,570
All right,that's right,that's all right.

308
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,630
You just go ahead,you
scream all you want!

309
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,450
You just scream all you
want. I sent the guards away.

310
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,400
It's just you and me.

311
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,660
I'm going nowhere until these
pills are in your gullet!

312
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,220
Okay,come on.

313
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,820
Open up! Swallow!
Swallow,swallow,here we go.

314
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,890
Open up,open,open.

315
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:15,050
Swallow! Swallow.
Swallow. Swallow,swallow!

316
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,380
Isn't this fantastic?

317
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,070
Go ahead. Pick an artery,Pop.

318
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,450
Which one you want me to start with?

319
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,800
How about the carotid?

320
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,250
That's always a winner for me.

321
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,790
- Hello?
- Allison? It's Caitlyn.

322
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,640
Caitlyn,I've been trying
to reach you all night.

323
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:00,500
I know. I've been on a plane. I
just landed. I got your messages.

324
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,320
Allison,do you have a passport?

325
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,840
What? Yeah. W
- Wait a second.

326
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,800
There's something I need to tell you.

327
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,870
I had another dream about
Justin and his father.

328
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,650
Please,Allison. I think
I already know. I just...

329
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,280
I'm sending a car to your house.

330
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,450
It'll bring you to the Phoenix airport.

331
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,010
The Lydecker hangar. There
will be a plane waiting.

332
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,040
It'll bring you here to me.

333
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,850
So we can talk.

334
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,650
W
- Where am I going?

335
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,710
I'd really rather not say.

336
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,770
Wait,Caitlyn,no. I
- I'm a mother.

337
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,160
I
- I have three children,a husband.

338
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:40,210
I'm not getting on a plane without
them all knowing where I'm going.

339
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,200
Mexico City.

340
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,190
The plane will land in Mexico City.

341
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,720
A car will be waiting
to bring you to me.

342
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,590
Allison...

343
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,090
what's happened here is horrible.

344
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,330
I really need you.

345
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,950
<i>******</i>

346
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,300
Allison,thank you for coming.

347
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:12,060
I wanted to fill you in
on what's happened here.

348
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,790
But I already know what happened here.

349
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,650
No,I don't think that you do.

350
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,730
Apparently,a radical terrorist faction,

351
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:26,300
was able to infiltrate Mr. Lydecker's
security force here at his vacation compound.

352
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,340
They slaughtered him,Allison.

353
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:34,300
Douglas Lydecker was butchered by
zealous anti-capitalists determined

354
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:38,700
to create chaos in the Western
World and its financial markets.

355
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,790
Really? And did they carve his eyes out?

356
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:47,380
Why are you protecting him? Why
are you protecting this monster?

357
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,060
It's not about him.

358
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,680
It's about Lydecker Industries and the
tens of thousands of people who work there

359
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,140
and the hundreds of thousands
of people who own stock.

360
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:03,880
Allison,public appetites,public perceptions--
those are the things that I know a lot about.

361
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,270
You tell the world that
the son killed the father

362
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,470
and you've sullied the
Lydecker name forever.

363
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,250
That is the kind of scanda l
that will destroy the company.

364
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:17,400
Kill sales,crater the stock price.

365
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:21,690
But you tell the world that
this was the work of terrorists?

366
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,720
Well,you can't buy the public sympathy
and goodwill that will engender.

367
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,770
People will rally around the company.

368
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,810
They'll feel that it's
their duty to do so.

369
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,030
And what about Justin? He's still out
there. What's to say he won't kill again?

370
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,400
I am taking care of it.

371
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,790
I'm going to find Justin
and I will deal with him

372
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,810
in a way that doesn't hurt
the company or either of us.

373
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,160
Us? What do you mean,us?

374
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,070
Us. You and me.

375
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,770
All of our fates are tied
to Justin at this point.

376
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,660
We have all helped to cover his crimes.

377
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:01,420
If Justin is ever
implicated in this murder,

378
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:07,850
I have no doubt that he will happily detail everything
we've done to help him elude the authorities.

379
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:13,900
So,I suggest you wipe that disapproving
look off your face and get on board.

380
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,800
We're in this together,Allison.

381
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:20,170
And the sooner you
realize that,the better.

382
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,240
I love you.

383
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:42,160
Young lady. First row? Eyes front.

384
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,660
I think that you really
need to go now,Garrett.

385
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,560
No.

386
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:50,560
Please.

387
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,810
I love you.

388
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,140
I don't understand.

389
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,780
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

390
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,340
Garrett,don't do this.

391
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,830
I am as low as I can possibly be.

392
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,760
Not that it matters to you but this...

393
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,790
This girl that I was tutoring
privately for the PSATs,

394
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,330
she died in a car accident
a couple weeks ago.

395
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,980
Drowned.

396
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,950
Today was the memorial and...

397
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,940
No,I just... I need to be by myself.

398
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:31,840
I need to not be worrying about you.

399
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,860
I need you to go.

400
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,720
Please don't make me call somebody.

401
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,730
I'm sorry about the girl.

402
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:46,350
But I'm staying here. I'm sleeping here.

403
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,980
Put it down.

404
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,950
- Put it down.
- Go.

405
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,700
Don't forget to get a
good night's sleep,folks.

406
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,050
Tomorrow's the big day.

407
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,050
- Miss Snowden?
- Yes?

408
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,330
Do you know somebody named Garrett?

409
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,120
I- I'm sorry.
Wh-What is your name?

410
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,960
Young lady,I'm talking to you.

411
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:34,590
You seem to know some things about me and I'd
like to know how and I'd like to know your name.

412
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,270
Sir?

413
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,800
Allison. What are you doing here?

414
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:53,610
Douglas Lydecker's son?

415
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,960
I know I should've told you sooner.

416
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:00,510
I debated with myself all the way
home on the plane and then I landed,

417
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:04,030
I called Joe,he told me to drive
right over here from the airport.

418
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,930
I'm so sorry.

419
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,690
You did what you had to
do to protect your family.

420
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:15,140
I understand that.

421
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,000
You were being threatened by Douglas
Lydecker. That's a formidable threat.

422
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:23,550
He might still be alive today if I
just ignored him and came right to you.

423
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,520
So,what happens now?

424
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,440
I really don't know.

425
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,750
If the Lydecker boy is truly
at large in a foreign country,

426
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,940
the first step would be
to try to extradite him.

427
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,380
And that's almost impossible to do
without concrete physical evidence.

428
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,080
You can't do anything?

429
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,330
Not at the moment.

430
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:49,260
I may talk to Justice,ask some
friends of mine there to take a second

431
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,310
and third look at this terrorist thing
with an especially jaundiced eye,but...

432
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,830
What?

433
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:04,590
I've been quaking in
anticipation of this conversation.

434
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,260
Douglas Lydecker convinced
me that the second that

435
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,690
I even uttered his son's name to you,

436
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,880
the earth was just gonna open up
and swallow me and my family whole.

437
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,530
But...

438
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,940
nothing is different now that we
had this conversation. Nothing.

439
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,490
Nothing's gonna happen.

440
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:32,340
Except I know that Justin
Lydecker is gonna kill again.

441
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:36,510
All of us here at the Lydecker
Corporation are obviously still reeling

442
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,750
with the news of the death of our
founder and CEO,Douglas Lydecker.

443
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,680
But I want to reassure
all of our investors,

444
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:47,920
our customers and our
employees around the globe that

445
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,430
our business operations will
continue without interruption.

446
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,910
I believe to do anything
less would be to suggest that

447
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:00,140
the savagery that ended this
great industrial titan's life

448
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:02,570
was somehow effective

449
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:08,910
and that our founder's belief in the power
of ideas to create worthwhile products

450
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,940
and meaningful employment
was somehow misplaced.

451
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,320
Of course,nothing could be
further from the truth. Thank you.

452
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:23,680
And that was the scene at a hastily called
press conference in Mexico today where Caitlyn...

453
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,820
Well,I'm glad somebody's
happy about all this.

454
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,790
Devalos actually said there
was nothing he could do?

455
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:34,520
Well,he needs evidence. He needs
Justin to come back to America.

456
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,880
The first he doesn't
have and the second...

457
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,360
is never gonna happen.

458
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:42,480
So,he's right,there's nothing to do.

459
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:48,430
Except of course,for me to find a lawyer
to get me out of this Lydecker contract.

460
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,290
But,hey...

461
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,610
that's why God invented tomorrow.

462
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,560
Can I talk to you for a second?

463
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:02,730
I didn't know what to do.

464
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,740
But I just didn't believe
that he would hurt her.

465
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,590
Not kill her,anyways.

466
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,500
And I just... I left.

467
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,490
I ran away.

468
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:21,550
I mean,she doesn't know my name or anything and
she's just a substitute,but I feel like an idiot.

469
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:28,120
I don't know how I'm gonna go in that classroom
tomorrow and take that test with her standing there.

470
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,340
You think maybe that was the point?

471
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:37,170
You think maybe Stacey Anne just
wanted to play a big joke on me?

472
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,820
Try and get me to embarrass myself with
the teacher who was gonna proctor the test?

473
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,790
I have no idea,honey,but you
are gonna walk in that classroom.

474
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,400
You are gonna take that test.

475
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,400
Obviously,I'll just be mortified.

476
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,620
I'll just slink in with my head down
and sit in the back and hope that

477
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:00,520
somehow she doesn't notice
me,doesn't say anything.

478
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:05,230
What are you saying? That you might
want to take one of those pills?

479
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,090
No,I don't think so.

480
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:14,100
I think the worst is over. I
think Stacey Anne is done with me.

481
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,440
I think that the hardest part's
gonna be walking through the door.

482
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,200
Go ahead. Pick an artery,Pop.

483
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,300
Which one do you want me to start with?

484
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:31,040
How about the carotid,huh?
That's always a winner for me.

485
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:03,390
Diane,are you out there?

486
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,550
Why is someone knocking on my door?

487
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,570
- She knew.
- What?

488
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,520
Caitlyn knew Justin was
gonna kill his father.

489
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:21,360
She knew it before I did,but she
didn't do anything to stop it.

490
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,580
You knew.

491
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,810
What?

492
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,120
No,"It's good to have you back"?

493
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:36,440
No,"How was your
flight?" Just,"You knew."

494
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,790
So,what did I know,Allison?

495
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,370
What is it that you think that I knew?

496
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,530
That Justin was gonna kill his father.

497
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:48,750
When I came here that day to tell you he
wasn't taking his medication,you already knew.

498
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:52,920
You had dreamt it. You-you...
you just let it happen.

499
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,370
That is quite an accusation.

500
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:57,890
So what? Now-now you're
just running the place?

501
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,530
Well,temporarily.

502
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,830
Ultimately,that will be up to the board.

503
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,590
But presuming I do a good job...

504
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,910
Allison,this will be good for you,too.

505
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:12,200
I understand better than most
what a valuable asset you can be.

506
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:16,970
I understand what a real value
you are to a company like ours.

507
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,710
You let Mr. Lydecker die.

508
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:24,530
I saw it,Caitlyn. I am onto you,and
I'm not gonna let you get away with it.

509
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,250
Get away with what exactly?

510
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,900
I mean,even if you were
accurate about any of this,

511
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:35,690
you still haven't suggested that
I actually did anything,have you?

512
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:41,090
I mean,all that might have happened was
maybe I had a dream and didn't tell anyone.

513
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,890
That's what you're saying,right?

514
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,480
That's not a crime.

515
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:49,960
Now I need to freshen up.

516
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,550
Have a little contemplation time.

517
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,900
Oh,I was thinking in maybe about
an hour,we'll have a little meeting,

518
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,400
you,me,some of the division leaders.

519
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,900
I have some big plans I'm gonna lay out.

520
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,040
Do you even know where he is? Justin?

521
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,630
He is dangerous!

522
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,090
You told me you were gonna
do something about him.

523
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,890
No. Actually,I have no idea.

524
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,090
That's part of what I
was counting on you for.

525
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:21,990
Allison,you seem to have a
special dream connection with him.

526
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,530
Caitlyn,you're 11:00 is here.

527
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,760
Allison,I need you to go. I
need to get on with my day.

528
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:40,360
Oh,Allison,remember,you're
still under contract here.

529
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,550
And I expect you to honor the
same level of confidentiality

530
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,830
that existed before Mr.
Lydecker passed on...

531
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,460
or face the same consequences.

532
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:57,040
Please take a moment to complete the
personal information in section A.

533
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:01,920
Take one test booklet and pass
the rest to the person behind you.

534
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,820
And your 25 minutes begins now.

535
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,630
Eyes front,no talking.

536
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:27,130
Julie,come on! Open the door!

537
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,980
I know you're in there.

538
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,780
It's Wednesday,10:30.
It's a school night.

539
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:37,730
Don't pretend you can't hear me.

540
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:42,940
I still got my key. I'm coming in,okay?

541
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,460
Julie?

542
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,730
Julie?

543
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,370
It's Garrett.

544
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,680
I'm coming in,okay?

545
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,730
Julie?

546
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:45,020
Hey,you okay?

547
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:50,410
It's okay,honey. Look...

548
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:54,200
They said that you could take
that test again in a couple months.

549
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,100
Look,I know you're disappointed.

550
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,940
I know you put a lot
of pressure on yourself.

551
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,490
And maybe next time we should
rethink this pill thing.

552
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,730
I mean,if...

553
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,020
if that's what makes it easier for
you to deal with these situations...

554
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,320
Someone's gonna take her eyes.

555
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,990
What?

556
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:18,530
Miss Snowden...on a
Wednesday,around 10:30,

557
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:23,300
someone's gonna come into her house
and cut her up and take her eyes.

558
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,500
Diane,can you make my
11:00 a lunch meeting?

559
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,400
I want to go down to R&D in the morning.

560
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,580
- Yes,of course.
- Thank you.

561
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,170
Justin Lydecker,son of recently
deceased billionaire Douglas Lydecker,

562
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:43,640
was arrested earlier this evening in connection
with a grisly string of murders in the Phoenix area.

563
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,640
We're told the case broke when Justin
Lydecker was caught breaking into

564
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,710
and entering an apartment
of a local teacher.

565
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:54,510
The authorities have confirmed that
Lydecker had numerous surgical knives

566
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,190
in his possession at
the time of the arrest.

567
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,340
The police are also said to
be investigating a theory that

568
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,280
the young man may actually have been
responsible for his father's death

569
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:07,160
- in Mexico City earlier this week,
- Oh,my God.

570
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,700
- a murder that was initially...
- Ms.Lynch?

571
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,270
Not now.

572
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,220
I'm sorry,but Allison Dubois is here.

573
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,900
She has the district attorney with her.

574
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,520
Come in. Have a seat.

575
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,760
Thank you,but that's okay.
We won't be staying that long.

576
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:29,420
I see that you already know about
the arrest of Justin Lydecker.

577
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,760
Yes,I'm-I'm shocked.

578
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,300
I knew he was troubled,but
I had no idea...

579
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:37,710
Stop,Caitlyn. Just stop.
He knows everything.

580
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,680
Justin-- at the
request of his counsel--

581
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:45,300
became quite talkative when I took
the death penalty off the table.

582
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:48,830
He shared some very interesting
information about you.

583
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,670
Apparently,you knew all about
his intentions towards his father.

584
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,660
Said he discussed it with you at length.

585
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,380
That you had tipped him off in advance that
his father planned to transport him to Mexico

586
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:04,800
and that you even suggested that that might be
the perfect place for him to kill his father.

587
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:08,970
That you knew you could pay off the right
officials to make it look like an act of terror.

588
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,810
Let me make sure I understand.

589
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:17,230
You're accusing me of some sort of crime
based on the word of an admitted serial killer?

590
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,360
Well,if that's all you
have,I'm quite confident that

591
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:27,020
my attorney's will make short
work of these accusations.

592
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:31,480
Actually,our case doesn't hinge
on Justin's word as much as

593
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,830
on the combined contents of his
voice mail inbox here at Lydecker,

594
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,820
his personal cell phone
text-message records

595
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:43,590
and the testimony of some of the
officials that you paid off in Mexico.

596
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:48,180
So do you want to take a moment to make
that phone call to your attorneys now

597
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:51,460
or would you prefer to
wait till we get downtown?

598
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:54,410
I'd prefer to make that
call now,if you don't mind.

599
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,170
Not a problem. Mrs. Dubois
and I will wait outside.

600
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,940
Oh,Allison.

601
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,210
I'm sure you'll understand that after
I get off the phone with my attorneys,

602
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,420
I'll be calling Human Resources and
instructing them to terminate your contract,

603
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:12,160
retrieve you car,collect any
keys,computer data,documents,

604
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:16,180
any items of clothing that might have
been purchased with corporate funds.

605
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:20,330
I'll also be sending someone to your
house to retrieve any property that

606
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:23,770
might have been purchased
with corporate dollars.

607
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,890
********

608
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:30,180
***********

609
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:33,460
