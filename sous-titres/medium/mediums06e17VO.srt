1
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:03,830
Hi honey, it's me,

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,810
you know, I've done with my
phiscal and I'm back at work.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,370
Doctor said I look good.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,330
Although, I must be getting older.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,840
She said she wants me to start
doing an annual mammogram.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,000
Really? You never done one of those?

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,260
It's cute.

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,580
Getting old is a bitch.

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,180
There she is.

10
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,980
I was wondering when you
were going to show up.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,030
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:46,840
Do I know you?

13
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:47,910
Of course you do.

14
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,590
You've worked for me for years.

15
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,180
It's me, Manuel.

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,390
District Attorney Devalos.

17
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:56,610
Duck!

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,190
You're out of there!

19
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,400
You like office dodge ball?

20
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,510
'Cause I'm picking you for my team.

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,090
I pick Allison!

22
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,290
So, what do you think?

23
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,570
Of what?

24
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:09,750
Of this.

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,560
It's the ultimate wish fulfillment.

26
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,410
You're anxious about getting older,

27
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,620
so you dream you're a child again.

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,640
No mammogram for you,
no colonoscopy for me.

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,400
Oh, and check out the hairline.

30
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,110
So, wait.

31
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,380
This is a dream?

32
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,730
And I'm dreaming it just to feel better?

33
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,540
Hey, that's what dreams are for.

34
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,660
To make you feel good.

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,680
You know what? You're right.

36
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,550
I think I'd forgotten.

37
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,520
Dreams should be fun.

38
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,940
They should make you feel good.

39
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,930
So this is how you use your gift?

40
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,330
Are you talking to me?

41
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,520
This
dream--

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,640
it's so... frivolous.

43
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,190
Frivolous?

44
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,070
Well, I don't know.

45
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,930
It does make me feel good.

46
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,880
It is fun.

47
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,230
I mean, that's what
dreams are for, right?

48
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,770
To make you feel good?

49
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,930
How can you be so
preoccupied with feeling good

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,490
when life is so bad?

51
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,360
Wait a second.

52
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,130
Is it?

53
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,060
Is life so bad?

54
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:26,900
It is for me.

55
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,500
Hey, you, you okay over there?

56
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,190
Huh? Yeah. Yeah. No.

57
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,090
I'm fine. I just... I had a bad dream.

58
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,510
Well, don't worry, dear.

59
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,330
I'm right here beside you.

60
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,410
Not.

61
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,370
Medium  617

62
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,800
Hi, Joe.

63
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,700
I remember you.

64
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,880
I'm glad that somebody knows who I am.

65
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,400
I am so tired, I got in
the car to drive home,

66
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,450
and I actually had to stop

67
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,510
and think for a minute where we lived.

68
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,360
It's not even 5:30.

69
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,310
What are you doing up?

70
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,000
Paying bills.

71
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,510
Had a bad dream.

72
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,800
Couldn't sleep.

73
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,070
Kind of lonely in there.

74
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,910
Well, I'm home now.

75
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,080
For four whole hours almost.

76
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,950
I have to be back at the office by 9:00.

77
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,250
What is with all these crazy hours?

78
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,400
Isn't Keith a one-man band?

79
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,960
Isn't he the guy who
doesn't need anybody's help?

80
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,060
Yeah, that was yesterday.

81
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,100
This is today.

82
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,860
Today, I think that the genius
may have finally met his match.

83
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,370
Burroughs-Strauss sold the government

84
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,020
a new high-tech drone.

85
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,960
But it doesn't work
without a new, lighter fuel.

86
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,990
Unfortunately, this new, lighter fuel

87
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,440
has yet to be invented.

88
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,550
That was supposed to be Keith's job

89
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,850
and so far, Keith has come up empty.

90
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,360
So, now he needs his seven dwarfs.

91
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,640
Well, I can't speak
for the other six guys,

92
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,810
but he sure is learning
on sleepy here... a lot.

93
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,220
Glad you're here.

94
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,560
Maybe you can make sense of this.

95
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,750
Well, I'll do my best.

96
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,100
But tell me something,
there's a coroner's van

97
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,790
full of people sitting
out in front of this house.

98
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,730
How about we invite
them in to do their work?

99
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:25,990
It's okay. Let them drink their coffee.

100
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,760
I think you need to see this first.

101
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,590
What a mess.

102
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,640
Tell me about it.

103
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,650
He, they, them-- busted
in through that window.

104
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,300
Somehow managed to turn
off the burglar alarm.

105
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,970
Then, uh, did whatever it is

106
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,150
they were trying to do in here.

107
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,210
I'm going to need you to
put on some fresh booties.

108
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,960
I don't understand, Lee.
Where are you taking us?

109
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,570
This all looks pristine.

110
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,570
Are you sure they even came
this far into the house?

111
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,490
Pretty sure, yeah.

112
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,390
Help me out here, Lee.
What are we looking at?

113
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,160
You're looking at the Prescotts.

114
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,270
Martin, a research chemist.

115
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,030
Irene,
stay-at-home mom.

116
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,470
Jason and Emily,

117
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,770
a couple of well-liked
honor roll students.

118
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,100
I don't get it.

119
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,560
Why are they just sitting there?

120
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,650
Are they real?

121
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,260
Real dead. Yeah.

122
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,250
What the hell happened here, Lee?

123
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,380
Well, I can only tell you what I know,

124
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,460
and that's not much.

125
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,010
There are injection marks
on all of their necks.

126
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,100
We're thinking that
the killer or killers

127
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,020
crept in while the family
slept and incapacitated them

128
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,640
one by one with some kind
of fast-acting poison.

129
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,070
Then he drained their blood.

130
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,000
- Drained their blood?
- Then he dressed them

131
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,500
or, uh, redressed them,

132
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,600
and then he posed them here.

133
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,070
Like this.

134
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,310
I'm sorry, you're
telling me that there's

135
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,550
four bodies' worth of blood
somewhere in this house?

136
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,720
Actually, no. We couldn't find

137
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,580
a single drop of blood
in the entire place.

138
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,970
That doesn't make any sense.

139
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,670
Yeah, it does if he
took the blood with him.

140
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,970
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

141
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,540
What's going on?

142
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,860
Uh, well, nobody quite knows what to do.

143
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,850
About what? He told us

144
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,180
to meet him in his office at 9:00

145
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,650
- and it's six minutes past 9:00. Come on. Let' 
- Slow down.

146
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,530
You might want to take a peek
inside before you go charging in.

147
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,180
All right, well, I guess
we've got to wake him up.

148
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,660
Uh, no, thank you.

149
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,760
I've seen The Hurt Locker.

150
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,710
I know how this ends.

151
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,350
Brian, you're being ridiculous.

152
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,930
Come on. We're under a deadline.

153
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,100
He's under a deadline.

154
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,150
He'd want us to wake him up.

155
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,660
We're talking about Keith here.

156
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,030
This guy was eccentric

157
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,530
before he couldn't turn water into wine.

158
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,000
Now that he's under all this
pressure with this fuel project,

159
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,090
he's downright certifiable.

160
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:49,620
Come on.

161
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,170
You want to go in there
and wake him up, go ahead.

162
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,640
Me? I'm staying right here
outside the blast zone.

163
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,220
Okay.

164
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,710
Besides, you bring him back to life,

165
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,790
he may want us all to
do some actual work.

166
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:58,600
God forbid.

167
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
Joe, that's not what I signed on for.

168
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,310
That's not what any of us signed on for.

169
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,480
Keith, it's 9:00.

170
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:20,680
Keith?

171
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,330
Hello?

172
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,570
It's time to wake up!

173
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,310
- Yes?
- Good morning.

174
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,680
This is your wake-up call.

175
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,350
Wake-up call? What are you...

176
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,240
What are you talking
about? I'm not asleep.

177
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,380
I-I'm in the middle
of a solution here...

178
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,560
How long have you been sitting there?

179
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,130
Just a couple of minutes.

180
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,880
Uh, don't, uh, take offense,

181
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,930
but you look like hell.

182
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,660
Do you want to just go
home, shower up a little bit?

183
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,040
Take a moment.

184
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,270
I can keep things moving along here.

185
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,400
There's, there's, there's no time.

186
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,350
Plus, I'm fine.

187
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,480
I just, I just need to
find a clear channel.

188
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,370
Excuse me?

189
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,410
A clear channel.

190
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,320
Look, the brain is an
amazing piece of engineering.

191
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,430
It's a freakin' phenomenal synthesis
of chemistry and electronics,

192
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,480
and sometimes the chemistry
is a little bit off

193
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,320
or the electronics
aren't firing correctly,

194
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,590
and I think that that's
what's going on right now.

195
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,020
Okay.

196
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,830
'Cause I can,

197
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,730
I can see the solution to this thing.

198
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,910
It's-it's-it's basically
just constructing something,

199
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,380
but with fewer molecules.

200
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,560
And I know how to do that,

201
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,380
but every time I try, it's...

202
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,840
I just can't get a clear channel.

203
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,490
It's-it's like I can't
get the picture right

204
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,430
inside of my brain.

205
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,780
Okay, well,

206
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,580
there's a, uh, whole bunch of
people waiting outside your door

207
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,210
who'd love to help you with that.

208
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,210
You mean "the clods"?

209
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,460
They're not clods.

210
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,330
They want to help.

211
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,390
They're operating on
little or no sleep, too.

212
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,240
They know you're smarter than they are.

213
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,110
We all know you're smarter than we are.

214
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,620
We just want you to
tell us what you need.

215
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:30,860
I need them

216
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,610
to stop trying to do
as little as possible

217
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,990
for as much reward as possible.

218
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,150
I need everyone to open their minds

219
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,060
to unexplored possibilities.

220
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,130
Okay, well, why don't
we get them in here

221
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,370
and get them going on that?

222
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,250
Come on in.

223
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,560
Okay...

224
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,210
Good morning, clods.

225
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,660
I'm still drowning.

226
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,300
Anyone have a life preserver?

227
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,230
What a shock.

228
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,140
Well, it's not a life preserver,

229
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,020
but I was working on
something last night

230
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,120
and, um, I looked at
it again this morning,

231
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,690
and I think it... I
think it's pretty good.

232
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,930
I know the solvent issue
has been hanging us up.

233
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,400
Um, I think the problem might
be there are too many hexanes.

234
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,610
Your channel isn't
clear either, my friend.

235
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,000
This will not work.

236
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,050
You haven't even read it.

237
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,270
I think it's pretty good.

238
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,620
Well, your thinking is flawed. Okay?

239
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,790
I've already tried it. It won't work.

240
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,150
Moving on. Uh...

241
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,270
How about you, guy?

242
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,000
Uh, do you have anything new for me?

243
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,880
Do you have anything old for me?

244
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,420
Riddle me this:

245
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,770
what exactly do you
do here at this company

246
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,880
besides consume time and space?

247
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,990
Uh, with all due respect,

248
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,420
I put in 17 hours yesterday

249
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,340
and just got back
from a four-hour break.

250
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,810
Time... and space.

251
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,330
Go home.

252
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,190
Excuse me?

253
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,260
Go home.

254
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,580
It's people like you

255
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,200
that make it hard for me
to get a clear channel.

256
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,340
You're using up all the air.

257
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,700
What, are you firing me?

258
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,040
Well, I don't really have a choice.

259
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,790
Killing you is against the law.

260
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,370
Whoa, Keith. Hey!

261
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,620
Go home!

262
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,010
Get! Be gone!

263
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,730
- Go!
- With pleasure.

264
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,880
Now, I hope that you people were
paying, uh, close attention to

265
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,420
what just happened there, okay?

266
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,060
There will be no free rides anymore.

267
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,990
You will help me.

268
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,450
Now,
this guy--

269
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,590
this guy gets to go home and be fired!

270
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,860
For the rest of you,
go back to your offices

271
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,170
and figure out a way to help me.

272
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,850
Figure out a way to help me!

273
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,970
So, Keith just fired him?

274
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,960
It's like he snapped.

275
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,790
Actually, you know, I think,

276
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,110
I think maybe he
snapped before any of us

277
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,480
even got into work this morning.

278
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,140
He was talking about
keeping a "Clear channel."

279
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,230
But then he chose Brian to go postal on.

280
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:30,920
I mean,

281
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,870
it's really kind of
scary how unhinged he got.

282
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,400
What is Brian going to do now?

283
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,460
Well, he's got 16 months
left on his contract.

284
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,320
I think he's going to sit at home.

285
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,730
Do nothing.

286
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,050
Cash his checks.

287
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,810
Well, of course, before
yesterday all he did

288
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,530
was sit at work and do nothing

289
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,840
and cash his checks.

290
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,010
Well, at least now he's
got an easier commute.

291
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,940
It's just nobody should
be humiliated like that

292
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,080
in front of their colleagues.

293
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,700
The irony was, the
whole day was a waste.

294
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,010
Nobody did any work.

295
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,950
Everybody's talking around on
eggshells with a pit in their stomach.

296
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,960
Still, you know,

297
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,490
as nuts as Keith got,

298
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,880
I still feel kind of sorry for him.

299
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:18,700
I don't think he's ever stared
down the mouth of failure before.

300
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,750
Girls, your dessert's ready!

301
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,930
- You want chocolate?
- Nah.

302
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,680
- Where's Ariel?
- Ariel?

303
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,400
You're not going to see that girl again.

304
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,500
She's on her new cell phone,

305
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,550
texting everyone she
knows about the prom.

306
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,180
Like what they're wearing

307
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,420
and who they're going with.

308
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,150
Yup... That girl's gone.

309
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,600
Mommy, there's a light in the TV.

310
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,960
Is that good?

311
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,660
Yeah.

312
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,280
Mom?

313
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,060
Aren't you going to sit?

314
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,410
Yeah, yeah, of course.

315
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,430
Hey, um, guys, do me
a favor. Scoot over.

316
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,850
But, Mommy, you always
sit in the middle.

317
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,790
Yeah... change is good.

318
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,540
You know?

319
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,350
A little change is good.

320
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,660
Well, that was pretty awesome.

321
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,480
I mean, I never thought I'd get to
save someone in lifeguard training.

322
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,890
And, um, let me see...

323
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:39,590
Oh, I rushed for 680 yards this
past season on the JV squad,

324
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,570
which is way better than that guy.

325
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,770
And... I just put some pretty pimp rims

326
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,750
on my '02 Mazda Prot?

327
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,840
But can you dance?

328
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,170
Um, excuse me?

329
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,810
I want to know if you can dance.

330
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,740
I mean, you're pretty
and all and that's great,

331
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,840
but this is the prom
we're talking about.

332
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,660
If you want to be my
date, I need to know that

333
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,920
you're not going to embarrass
me on the dance floor.

334
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,680
Okay.

335
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,620
Yeah, uh, I think I can dance.

336
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,200
Show me.

337
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,790
Now?

338
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,950
By myself? Look...

339
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,500
Number Four, if you don't want to,

340
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,100
I'm sure that one of your competitors

341
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,790
would love to show me what he's got.

342
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,460
No, no-no-no,
it's cool.

343
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,430
I'll dance.

344
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,630
Is that what you had in mind,

345
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,550
'cause I also know a little ballroom.

346
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,210
No, it's, uh, it's fine.

347
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,730
You can get back in
line. I'll let you know.

348
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:03,980
Excuse me?

349
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,460
Excuse me?

350
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,630
These are closed auditions.

351
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,590
You're really not
supposed to be in here.

352
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,240
So this is how you use your gift?

353
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,720
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

354
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:27,330
Look, I'm having a really cool dream.

355
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,300
And I know that you popped
into my head for a reason,

356
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,750
but... whatever it is, do
you think it could wait?

357
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,790
I'm sorry. I don't think so.

358
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,120
Ariel!

359
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,150
Ariel, what's wrong?

360
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,960
Shh...

361
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,220
Honey, honey, honey, what's wrong?

362
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,550
This girl...

363
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,760
I never saw her before.

364
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,450
She popped up in my dream...

365
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,170
and she killed herself.

366
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,200
She put a gun in her mouth
and blew her brains out.

367
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,650
Oh, honey.

368
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,460
She seemed so angry at me.

369
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,850
She asked me if this
is how I used my gift.

370
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,020
What did she say?

371
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,160
- No! 
- Mommy!

372
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,810
Girls, what's going on?

373
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,810
What's wrong?

374
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,910
I was having this great dream.

375
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,220
It was snowing right here in Phoenix.

376
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,130
And they called off the schools.

377
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:33,210
And everybody was going down
to the frozen lake to ice skate.

378
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,640
And it was so much fun.

379
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,200
But then, this older girl showed up.

380
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,960
She looked at me and she said,

381
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,440
"Is this how you use your gift?"

382
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,430
And then she just started walking,

383
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,270
walking right out into
the middle of the ice.

384
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,170
And everybody kept yelling at her,

385
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,820
'cause the ice was too thin.

386
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,470
But she just kept
walking until it cracked.

387
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,700
Then she fell in.

388
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,740
She just fell in. She was gone.

389
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,570
This girl-- she didn't
have black hair, did she?

390
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,330
Yeah.

391
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,220
Yeah, well, I, uh, I
dreamt about her, too.

392
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,540
Whoa, well, wait a second.

393
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,000
Is that even possible?

394
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,370
It has to be.

395
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,360
I just dreamt about her, too.

396
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,800
I don't know. I don't get it.

397
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,110
Why are Ariel and Bridgette

398
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,570
dreaming about this young
girl killing herself?

399
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,090
I mean, I dreamt about her last night,

400
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,800
but it's not like I told them about it.

401
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,080
Al, you're all... you're
apples from the same tree.

402
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,030
Maybe...

403
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,780
Maybe they sensed what you'd seen.

404
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,330
I don't know. I don't understand.

405
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,800
Who is this girl?

406
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,470
Why is she so angry with us?

407
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,010
Al, for all we know, she's nobody.

408
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,790
You've never seen her before.

409
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,560
The girls have never seen her before.

410
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,320
Maybe she's not even a real person.

411
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,050
Okay, forget I said that.

412
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,360
Listen, Al,

413
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,240
I'm coming off an all-nighter.

414
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,450
I beg you... can we
throw a flag on the play

415
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,060
and resume this
conversation in the morning?

416
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,310
Begging is good.

417
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,740
This begging works.

418
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:21,690
Jennifer?

419
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,810
You still awake?

420
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,190
Yeah, I guess so.

421
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,340
You doing okay?

422
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,490
I mean, uh, this being your
first night and all, I...

423
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,950
I figured you might be nervous.

424
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,040
No, I'm okay.

425
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,930
My wife was telling
me that this is, what--

426
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,530
your third foster home?

427
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,320
Well, I want you to know,

428
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,510
I'm determined to make it your last.

429
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,290
If anybody bothers
you at your new school,

430
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,200
you tell me.

431
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,850
If my missus starts to
lose her temper with you,

432
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,410
now, you tell me.

433
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,750
I mean, if you want anything...

434
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,320
You need anything...

435
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,330
You tell me.

436
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:17,830
Does that sound good?

437
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:24,680
Good.

438
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,270
I'm glad.

439
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,290
So, listen,

440
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,890
if I'm gonna be looking out for you,

441
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,580
making sure you're happy,

442
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,090
I-I need you to look out for me...

443
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,930
...make sure I'm happy.

444
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,500
You got that, right?

445
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,320
Yes, I'm looking for information

446
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,210
on a Jennifer.

447
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,800
Sorry, I don't have a last name.

448
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,760
She's around 16 to 18 years of age,

449
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,080
but that's just a guess.

450
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,030
What do you mean there's
nothing you can tell me?

451
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,700
I told you I'm with the
district attorney's office.

452
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,670
No, I don't have a subpoena.

453
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,320
Well, fine, I'll get a subpoena.

454
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,640
What is this?

455
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,450
Who took this? Is, is this ours?

456
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,050
Is this a crime scene photograph?

457
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,380
Not the way that you mean it, no.

458
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,770
This came to us through the offices

459
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,940
of the Arizona Observer.

460
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,140
Apparently, our killers took pictures

461
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,850
and wanted to share them
with the Observer's readers.

462
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,530
This will be on the front
page of the newspaper tonight

463
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,790
and I'm sure it will make its way

464
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,020
onto all the evening newscasts.

465
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,940
And this message--
"More to come"--

466
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,430
it's written in blood, isn't it?

467
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,730
It's their blood--
the Prescotts.

468
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,410
According to the lab,
each letter can be matched

469
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,090
to a different member of the family.

470
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,280
But that aside, the photo
and the envelope it came in

471
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,390
were as clean as the room
where we found the family--

472
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,540
no prints, no fibers, no DNA.

473
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,060
Meaning we're exactly
where we were yesterday,

474
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,970
only now we're poised
to have a citywide panic

475
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,220
and we know that whoever did this

476
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,550
is planning on doing it again.

477
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,210
Yeah.

478
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,350
Keith, did you have the locks...?

479
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,720
- Mr. Burroughs.
- Joe.

480
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,020
Forgive me, sir, I didn't
realize you were in here.

481
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,970
I didn't realize anyone was in here.

482
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:17,740
No, i-it's all right.

483
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,700
Are you having a problem with something?

484
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,150
No, it's, it's... I-I
don't know, it's...

485
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,280
It'll wait till you two are finished.

486
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,220
No, it's okay.

487
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,520
If you have a problem, just spit it out.

488
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,000
No, it's, it's not a big deal, really.

489
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:26,830
It's just, uh,

490
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,070
uh, I just got back from
lunch and my office is locked.

491
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,620
My key doesn't work.

492
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,640
So, I just talked to Jason.

493
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,770
He said that he saw a maintenance
guy changing the locks,

494
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,650
and when he asked him about it

495
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,100
he said that, uh, you told him to do it?

496
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,460
That's right. I did.

497
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,370
I can't have you in there anymore.

498
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,790
Excuse me?

499
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,610
I can't have you sitting in there.

500
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,580
You may just want to stay home.

501
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,630
Really? Why is that?

502
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:59,290
Oh, uh, I noticed when I came
in very early this morning that,

503
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:03,980
that the ideas were flowing
very freely, very easily.

504
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,120
And, uh, and then when you came in,

505
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,390
there's something about you
being in that office that...

506
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:15,350
oh, everything just
started getting backed up.

507
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,720
But then when you went to lunch...

508
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,120
The flow came back?

509
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,110
It did, yeah.

510
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:23,790
I see.

511
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:28,380
So you think I'm-I'm...
constipating your thinking?

512
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,670
I don't think. I know.

513
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,940
This is a problem
that's easily solvable.

514
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,040
We'll just find Mr. Dubois here

515
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:38,880
an office that doesn't...
interfere with your flow.

516
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,770
At least until this project is done.

517
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,340
Super. Super.

518
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,710
Well, you look like you're
making progress here,

519
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,310
so maybe I'll just take Joe

520
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,080
and we'll go on a little office hunt.

521
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,020
Sounds good.

522
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,680
- Sound good?
- It sounds good.

523
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,580
All right.

524
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,530
Listen. Don't worry,

525
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,860
I'll get maintenance
back down here in a jiffy

526
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,500
to fix that lock, okay?

527
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,580
Well, wait a second.

528
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,540
What the hell was that all about?

529
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,400
Hey, the man thought you
were screwing with his flow.

530
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,490
What do you want me to do?

531
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,100
I need him. I need that flow.

532
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,760
It was surreal how
Burroughs just sat there

533
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,760
coddling Keith like he's
some sort of spoiled child.

534
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,540
Well, it sounds like
Burroughs is determined

535
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,750
to have Keith finish what he's doing,

536
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,000
no matter what it takes.

537
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,720
I know, but now I spend my day

538
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,690
sneaking in and out of my office,

539
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,980
living in fear that
Keith is going to walk by

540
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,910
and realize I'm still sitting in there

541
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,630
interfering with his clear channel.

542
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,990
Stopping up his flow.

543
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,370
I'm a grown man.

544
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,530
I feel ridiculous.

545
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,350
If that's Keith, tell
him I'm not leaving town.

546
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:47,180
I don't care how
constipated his brain gets.

547
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,000
Hello.

548
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,100
Oh, no.

549
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,170
Yeah, of course.

550
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,220
Text me the address.

551
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,690
What's going on? Who was that?

552
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,540
It was Devalos.

553
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,660
They found another family.

554
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,260
Same thing, they're all dead.

555
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,370
Blood's gone, posed for pictures.

556
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,880
He wants me to go take a look.

557
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,770
You're looking at the Andersons.

558
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,320
An hour and a half ago,
the lady across the street

559
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,110
saw a strange white van in the driveway.

560
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,410
She called 911.

561
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,580
Patrolman was here within ten minutes.

562
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,020
He found the family in here.

563
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,940
No mess in the kitchen this time.

564
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,020
No blood again either.

565
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,400
Hard to figure out how they
get it out of the bodies

566
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,550
without even a trace of it
appearing anywhere in the house.

567
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,290
But anyway, we're guessing
the killer or killers

568
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,340
just bolted as soon they
heard the squad car roll up.

569
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,220
Yeah, want to come over here?

570
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,570
Stop him! He's getting away!

571
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,680
Stop him!

572
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,250
Turn him around.

573
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,380
Let me see his face.

574
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,670
They processed her.

575
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,340
Brought her down for questioning.

576
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,690
Do we know anything yet?

577
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,530
Well, we know her name.

578
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,440
Jennifer Whitten.

579
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,630
We know that she's 17 years old.

580
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,160
We know she turns 18 tomorrow.

581
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,260
And we know she's homeless.

582
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,600
Turns out she's a ward of the state.

583
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,730
Or at least she's supposed to be.

584
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,470
She and her parents were in a
tragic car accident two years ago.

585
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,930
She survived, they didn't.

586
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,310
Since then, she's cycled
through three foster homes

587
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,230
before she ran away,

588
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,010
took to the streets.

589
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,150
Think I already knew that.

590
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,030
Excuse me?

591
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,620
I dreamt about her the other night.

592
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,150
I couldn't figure out why.

593
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,190
I still can't.

594
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:32,990
Well, let's see what we can find out.

595
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,820
So you can't tell me why

596
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,910
you were in that house tonight?

597
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,710
No, that's not what I said.

598
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,160
I said I won't tell you

599
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,860
why I was in that house tonight.

600
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,140
Have you seen those people before?

601
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,390
That's the Prescott family.

602
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,470
They were killed two nights ago.

603
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,350
Drained of their blood. Posed.

604
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,230
Just like the family whose
house we found you in tonight.

605
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,230
This ringing any bells for you?

606
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,240
I'm sorry. I don't
know what to tell you.

607
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,540
I've never seen these
people before in my life.

608
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,010
You're sure about that?

609
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,220
You know what? I'm going
to have you arrested.

610
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,300
You're going to what?

611
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,260
You heard me.

612
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,370
I may be poor, I may be only 17,

613
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,450
but I've seen enough television
to be pretty aware of my rights.

614
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,000
I want a public defender.

615
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,920
And I'm not answering any more
questions until you get me one.

616
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,140
Thoughts?

617
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,840
Young, female,
destitute--

618
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,460
she doesn't exactly fit the profile
of a serial killer, does she?

619
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,600
No, she does not.

620
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,550
And then there's all those
pesky unanswered questions

621
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,050
like where's the murder weapon?

622
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,500
What did she do with all the blood?

623
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:13,520
Where's the camera she used
to take pictures of her victims

624
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,740
once she posed them?

625
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,100
She's lying, by the way.

626
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,130
I saw that when she was talking to you.

627
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:22,240
She was there, standing inside
the first victims' house--

628
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,200
the Prescotts.

629
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,320
She lied when she said
she'd never seen them before.

630
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,910
You sure about this?

631
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:32,780
Well...

632
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,360
then I guess I send Forensics
back to the Prescotts

633
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,490
with a fine-tooth comb.

634
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,000
Hopefully they can
find something, anything

635
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,970
that connects Miss Whitten
to that scene as well.

636
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,120
Because even though we found her

637
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,200
hiding in the Andersons' home,

638
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,940
the truth is, while we have
a hell of a case against her

639
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,280
for breaking and entering,

640
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,850
there's no evidence whatsoever
that ties her to these murders.

641
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,250
I don't know about you
but I need some sleep.

642
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,710
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

643
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,630
Mr. Burroughs...

644
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,010
I was just...

645
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,440
I was just trying to
get back to my office

646
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,560
before Keith saw me.

647
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,660
I wouldn't worry about it.

648
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,640
Keith's not here today.

649
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,430
You're kidding?

650
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,120
Well, that's fantastic.

651
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,930
Well, I'm glad
somebody's happy about it.

652
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,110
Jenn?

653
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,280
You up?

654
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,890
I...

655
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,930
found this.

656
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,530
Somebody took, like,
two bites and chucked it.

657
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
Nicky, what if I told you

658
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,780
I know a place where we
could get some real food?

659
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,570
I don't know about this, Jenn.

660
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,160
This is a nice place.

661
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,520
Even the mailbox is nice.

662
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,280
They gotta have an alarm, right?

663
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,140
It doesn't matter.

664
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,390
I'll just bust a window or something.

665
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,320
It won't go off.

666
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,470
What?

667
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,630
I'm telling you it's
not a problem, okay?

668
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,490
So just keep watch

669
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,010
and, stay here, okay?

670
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:14,270
You dream things, don't you?

671
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,000
That's how you knew how
to get into those houses.

672
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,450
You saw him do it.

673
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,300
You saw him disable those alarm systems.

674
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,060
That's how you knew it was safe.

675
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,290
You were looking for food, weren't you?

676
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,940
Tell me I'm wrong.

677
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,810
I'm not telling you anything.

678
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,740
My lawyer said I don't have to speak

679
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,300
to anyone without him around,

680
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,870
so that's what I'm gonna do: not speak.

681
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,710
Okay.

682
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,680
Then I'll do the talking.

683
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,200
I know something about this.

684
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,440
I dream things, too.

685
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,200
Except in my dreams...

686
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,670
they usually come to me from
people who are already dead.

687
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,970
They want to show me something.

688
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:05,320
But your dreams seem to come
from someone who's alive.

689
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,070
It's as if you're seeing
things through their eyes.

690
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,000
What?!

691
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,710
The fact that this person
is on a deadly rampage

692
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:19,470
slaughtering whole families,
it doesn't matter to you?

693
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,970
People die every day.

694
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,940
What? The fact that they're
families makes it worse?

695
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,400
A family is just a thing
that you're part of,

696
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,610
and then you're not.

697
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,300
What do you want from me?

698
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,460
I want you to tell me what you see.

699
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:43,690
I see a lady who won't
take no for an answer.

700
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,290
If you change your mind...

701
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,140
I'm gonna give you my card

702
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,070
and my home phone number.

703
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,690
If you change your mind.

704
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,990
I won't.

705
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,380
Joe, you in there? It's Dan Burroughs.

706
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:25,130
Yeah! Sorry.

707
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,830
Hi, Mr. Burroughs.

708
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,090
You haven't seen Keith, have you?

709
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,080
Me? No, no.

710
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,650
I've been trying to avoid him, actually.

711
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,800
Something wrong?

712
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,050
Well, he's

713
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,240
sort of gone MIA, disappeared.

714
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,790
We're guessing he's gone off his meds.

715
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,150
His meds?

716
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:48,960
Keith is on medication?

717
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,240
He's supposed to be,

718
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,540
but now he's gone out
of touch, isn't here.

719
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,860
Doesn't seem to be at home.

720
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,430
He's supposed to co-lead
a presentation for

721
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,950
the Department of Defense on
this biofuels project tomorrow.

722
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,890
Yeah,

723
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,360
What's your tomorrow look like?

724
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,320
Do you have a suit?

725
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:08,760
Mr. Burroughs,

726
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,650
I consider myself a pretty smart man,

727
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,330
but I'm not a mind-reader.

728
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,060
Keith kept most of his work on this
project pretty close to the vest.

729
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,600
I wish I could help you out.

730
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:18,970
I'll send you home with
everything you need:

731
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,290
all the studies, all the trials.

732
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,740
Anything you don't understand,

733
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,780
my lab guys will explain
to you in the morning.

734
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,630
tomorrow afternoon,
I'm wagering you'll be

735
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,090
the second-smartest guy in the country

736
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,810
on the subject of ultralight biofuels.

737
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:31,040
Or at least you'll seem
like the second-smartest guy.

738
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,090
I appreciate this.

739
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,150
They just released her.

740
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:40,630
I'm sorry?

741
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,970
Jennifer Whitten.
They just released her.

742
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:43,950
I thought you'd like to know.

743
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,650
But I-I just saw her this morning.

744
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,730
I thought we were holding
her in protective custody.

745
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,610
She's a minor. She
doesn't have any parents.

746
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,240
They can't just...

747
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,240
She turned 18 today.

748
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,280
That, coupled with the fact

749
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,670
that we can't find even a
trace of Miss Whitten's DNA

750
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,700
at the original crime scene

751
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,490
means we just can't hold her any longer.

752
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,490
They've got her on
breaking and entering,

753
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,780
but the court isn't gonna hear
that until three months from now,

754
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,970
so her public defender filed
a motion on her behalf and...

755
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:07,990
Look,

756
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,990
I know you think she knows
more than she's admitting,

757
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,110
but there's nothing I can do.

758
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,220
She's back on the street.

759
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,330
I'm sorry.

760
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:00,900
No.

761
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:02,610
Hello?

762
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,840
Jennifer, is that you?

763
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,960
Are you all right?

764
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,140
What's going on?

765
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,450
Are you in a public place?

766
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,680
I know where that is.

767
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,660
Stay where there are people.

768
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,610
I'll come and get you.

769
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,140
Coming to get who?

770
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,100
Who are you coming to get?

771
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,090
Or leaving to get?

772
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,550
Allison?!

773
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,410
That's all right.

774
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,230
You'll tell me when you get back.
