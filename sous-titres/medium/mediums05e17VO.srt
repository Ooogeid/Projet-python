2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,700
I don't know how to do it.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,200
I don't know how to fire these people.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,500
I want to buy back my company
and my idea from you.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,200
The business is not for sale.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,200
Your idea is not for sale.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,200
You are not for sale.

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,900
If you're still interested...

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,700
I'll sell you back your company.

10
00:00:25,705 --> 00:00:28,200
If you can get together
a couple of million dolrs,

11
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:31,805
we can figure o how you can
pay me the balance over time.

12
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:33,609
I'm Cynthia Keener.

13
00:00:33,607 --> 00:00:35,909
I'm an investigator with Ameritips.

14
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:39,001
I guess she's hoping I'll be able
to help her with some of her cases.

15
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:41,602
Cynthia Keener had a daughter named Suzie
<i>(Young woman abducted from mall parking lot)</i> 

16
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:43,700
who went missing in 1998.

17
00:00:44,105 --> 00:00:45,703
I had nothing to do with her death.

18
00:00:45,706 --> 00:00:48,400
If you think this is over, you're wrong.

19
00:00:48,407 --> 00:00:52,301
<i>Suzie... it was my job
to stand up for her.</i>

20
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:54,701
<i>And now I finally have.</i>

21
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:58,103
It's all right, Allison.

22
00:00:58,105 --> 00:01:00,503
I've called the authorities.

23
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:02,601
They'll be here in a moment.

24
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:20,101
You should have that looked at.

25
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:23,302
Could leave a nasty scar.

26
00:01:23,608 --> 00:01:26,603
You're late. I was about to leave.

27
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:28,502
Oh, I'm not sure I believe that.

28
00:01:28,508 --> 00:01:31,703
I think you'd have waited
as long as you had to.

29
00:01:36,507 --> 00:01:39,400
It's all there. Unmarked bills,
just like you asked.

30
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:41,703
No tricks. No transmitters.

31
00:01:44,607 --> 00:01:46,601
Where's Bethany?

32
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,903
Down there.

33
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:53,001
Oh, my God. What have you done?

34
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:55,103
I buried her down there an hour ago.

35
00:01:55,107 --> 00:01:56,803
Figure she has maybe...

36
00:01:56,807 --> 00:01:59,501
five or six minutes of air left.

37
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:16,103
Bethany! Can you hear me?

38
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:19,202
Bethany! Bethany, I'm coming!

39
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,903
Bethany! Can you hear me?!

40
00:02:23,906 --> 00:02:27,203
Can you hear me? I'm coming!

41
00:02:27,207 --> 00:02:29,502
Bethany! Can you hear me?

<i>S05E17
The First Bite Is The Deepest</i>

43
00:03:20,507 --> 00:03:22,503
What do you think ?

44
00:03:22,505 --> 00:03:26,203
Professional or funereal?

45
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,901
Definitely professional.

46
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:32,400
Professional undertaker, maybe.

47
00:03:33,808 --> 00:03:36,902
You know what? You look like the kind
of guy I would sell a company to.

48
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:40,902
Really ? Well, that and two million
dollars will get me a company.

49
00:03:40,905 --> 00:03:43,101
Come on, you just need more time
to get the money.

50
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:44,502
Terry will understand that.

51
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:45,800
Today's the deadline.

52
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:49,001
I mean, it's not like I have some of
the money. I don't have any of the money.

53
00:03:49,006 --> 00:03:50,900
And the truth is,
even if I do get an extension

54
00:03:50,908 --> 00:03:54,202
I don't know where I'm going
to get this money from.

55
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,600
Which tie ?

56
00:03:56,906 --> 00:03:58,403
Earth to Allison.

57
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:03,702
No. No tie. Neither one. Too much.

58
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,802
That's why I married you.

59
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:08,100
What are so taken with on
my computer there ?

60
00:04:08,106 --> 00:04:11,502
I had a dream last night
about Cynthia Keener.

61
00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:14,403
A "woman in prison" kind of dream ?

62
00:04:14,408 --> 00:04:15,701
No.

63
00:04:15,707 --> 00:04:17,603
No, it was something that took place a while ago,
<i>(INVESTIGATOR BROKERS SAFE RETURN OF KIDNAP VICTIM)</i>

64
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:19,303
and I just found this old newspaper article
<i>(GIRL BURIED ALIVE IN HARROWING ORDEAL)</i>

65
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:22,003
that makes it look like it
actually happened.

66
00:04:22,006 --> 00:04:23,300
Do you want to share ?

67
00:04:23,308 --> 00:04:24,201
Do you really care ?

68
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:25,503
No.

69
00:04:25,506 --> 00:04:27,202
Fine, then ignore me.

70
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,303
Hi. My name's Allison Dubois.

71
00:04:33,308 --> 00:04:35,103
This is actually the third
time that I've called.

72
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,503
I'm trying to arrange a visit
with a prisoner that you have there.

73
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:40,201
Her name's Cynthia Keener.

74
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:43,501
Yeah, I am calling from a city phone,

75
00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:45,702
but this is not official business.

76
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:46,901
You don't understand my wife !

77
00:04:46,907 --> 00:04:48,903
She checks in with me
three times a day

78
00:04:48,906 --> 00:04:50,201
I haven't heard from her !

79
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:52,600
- I'm a taxpayer !
- I see...

80
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:54,202
This is a crime !

81
00:04:57,806 --> 00:05:00,700
Look, all I know is,
my wife has been missing for 12 hours,

82
00:05:00,706 --> 00:05:02,303
and nobody is doing a damn thing.

83
00:05:02,305 --> 00:05:03,803
- Mr. Sipes ?
- Mr. Sipes, what ?

84
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:06,703
It's standard police procedure to wait
36 hours before filing a missing...

85
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,001
Don't talk to me about 36 hours !

86
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,301
If I'd have backed you in the election,

87
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:15,200
I am sure that the National Guard would
be out there right now looking for Amy.

88
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:27,303
I understand. So, I'll just...

89
00:05:27,305 --> 00:05:28,601
I'll just wait for your call.

90
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:30,302
Let me give you my cell number.

91
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah, come in.

92
00:05:35,506 --> 00:05:37,101
You okay ?

93
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:39,600
Oh... you mean that
little scene just now ?

94
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,500
I've been through worse.
Just not lately.

95
00:05:42,506 --> 00:05:43,703
Who was that man ?

96
00:05:43,706 --> 00:05:46,603
I thought you knew.
That was Christopher Sipes.

97
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:48,101
Why do I know that name ?

98
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:49,400
He's become a pretty big player

99
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:51,802
in downtown Phoenix real estate
the last few years.

100
00:05:51,808 --> 00:05:53,102
Has his name on a lot of buildings,

101
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:55,301
or on the signs in front of buildings.

102
00:05:55,307 --> 00:05:57,500
A real rags to riches story.

103
00:05:57,508 --> 00:06:00,100
Although making a lot of
money hasn't made him any nicer.

104
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:01,401
Oh, and here's a shock.

105
00:06:01,405 --> 00:06:03,900
His wife disappeared, or so he says.

106
00:06:03,908 --> 00:06:05,700
You think otherwise ?

107
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:06,900
You're right.

108
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,101
Why would anyone leave
the charming Mr. Sipes

109
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:11,703
and not tell him where they're going ?

110
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,903
Nonetheless, I'm going to ask Detective
Scanlon to run her license plates,

111
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,900
and check her credit cards,
do whatever we can

112
00:06:17,905 --> 00:06:20,103
until the police can launch
an official search.

113
00:06:20,105 --> 00:06:21,701
Is there anything I can do ?

114
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:29,101
<i>You have a collect call from

115
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:31,803
<i>an inmate at the Arizona State
Women's Correctional Facility.

116
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,503
<i>To accept the call, please press "one."</i>

117
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:37,801
You don't want to see me.

118
00:06:37,808 --> 00:06:38,802
Cynthia.

119
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:41,402
It's not like I have a lot of
great stories to tell.

120
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,002
Sun comes up. Sun goes down.

121
00:06:44,007 --> 00:06:48,601
I know because I watch the shadows
travel across my cell wall all day.

122
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:49,703
Now you know everything.

123
00:06:49,707 --> 00:06:51,700
Why don't you save yourself the trip ?

124
00:06:51,706 --> 00:06:53,502
I had a dream about you last night.

125
00:06:53,508 --> 00:06:55,800
Was it good ?
Do I get out of here ?

126
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:57,601
Lie. Give me hope.

127
00:06:57,608 --> 00:06:58,603
I'm not going to tell you.

128
00:06:58,607 --> 00:07:01,102
Not unless you let me come and see you.

129
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:17,101
Sorry I'm late.

130
00:07:17,107 --> 00:07:19,301
Actually, I'm not going
to be able to eat.

131
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:21,603
I only have a few minutes.

132
00:07:25,606 --> 00:07:26,703
You look anxious.

133
00:07:26,705 --> 00:07:28,700
No, no...

134
00:07:28,707 --> 00:07:30,700
Well, maybe a little.

135
00:07:30,707 --> 00:07:32,900
It's gone, Joe.

136
00:07:34,108 --> 00:07:36,301
I sold it.

137
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:39,202
That deadline wasn't one
I picked arbitrarily.

138
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,203
I needed to get
your venture off my books.

139
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,102
I explained that to you.

140
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:47,001
I felt I owed you the opportunity
to buy the company,

141
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:48,701
and had you been able
to come up with the money,

142
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:52,400
I'd have happily sold it to you, but...

143
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,300
here we are.

144
00:07:54,304 --> 00:07:57,205
I didn't have much trouble
finding a buyer.

145
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:59,609
You should be proud, Joe.

146
00:07:59,607 --> 00:08:02,709
You've built an attractive
little start-up.

147
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:04,402
Who's the buyer ?

148
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:07,600
It's an outfit called
Tesseract Industrial.

149
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:09,002
Out of San Diego.

150
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:11,201
Coming on like gangbusters.

151
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:13,701
It's run by a fellow named
Simon Burwell

152
00:08:13,707 --> 00:08:17,602
who's been on a bit of a buying spree.

153
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:19,103
What happens to me, Terry ?

154
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:22,801
Well, your contract
is part of the sale, so

155
00:08:22,807 --> 00:08:27,102
it'll be up to Tesseract to either
keep you on board or pay you off.

156
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:29,301
Well, that's between you and them.

157
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:34,901
Look... I know how much
this project meant to you,

158
00:08:34,907 --> 00:08:37,403
and I know how painful it must be

159
00:08:37,405 --> 00:08:42,400
to realize you're probably not going
to be able to see it through to the end.

160
00:08:42,406 --> 00:08:44,002
My advice to you ?

161
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:45,903
Get a good lawyer

162
00:08:45,908 --> 00:08:49,800
and make them pay through the nose
when they try to settle with you.

163
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:54,201
Money won't get rid of all
the pain, but it'll help.

164
00:08:54,906 --> 00:08:56,800
Waiter ?

165
00:08:56,807 --> 00:08:58,603
Anything he wants.

166
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:05,200
Thank you.

167
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,202
It's wonderful to see you, too.

168
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:44,200
I wasn't sure what you wanted,
what you needed.

169
00:09:56,008 --> 00:10:00,003
You're going to make me
the most popular girl on Block C.

170
00:10:03,405 --> 00:10:07,301
I've been dreaming about this,
and I don't know why.

171
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:16,102
First time I met Bethany was when
I pulled her out of that grave.

172
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:17,201
I saw it.

173
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:21,301
The man in the mask.
The bite mark on his hand.

174
00:10:21,305 --> 00:10:24,000
The bite marks were
courtesy of Bethany.

175
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:27,000
The night he buried her,
she fought back.

176
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:29,902
She sunk her teeth in real deep.

177
00:10:29,908 --> 00:10:33,200
She wanted to hurt him,
mark him permanently.

178
00:10:33,205 --> 00:10:35,802
The way he did to her.

179
00:10:35,808 --> 00:10:38,401
They never caught him, did they ?

180
00:10:38,408 --> 00:10:39,902
What about the girl ?

181
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,400
Did you keep in touch ?

182
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:44,700
I heard some things. Nothing good.

183
00:10:44,707 --> 00:10:47,802
The parents were quite well off,
before the kidnapping.

184
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:51,502
The two million ransom ruined them.

185
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:53,301
The father committed suicide.

186
00:10:53,308 --> 00:10:55,901
The mother started drinking
very heavily,

187
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:58,002
started taking drugs.

188
00:10:58,007 --> 00:11:01,402
She fell asleep one night
behind the wheel.

189
00:11:01,405 --> 00:11:04,200
Drove off a bridge.

190
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:09,600
I want to say Bethany was... 15.

191
00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:11,202
And after that ?

192
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:13,703
After that, there were more stories--

193
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,700
foster homes, drugs...

194
00:11:15,705 --> 00:11:18,403
maybprostitution.

195
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:22,203
Listen, Allison.

196
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:25,301
I don't know why you're asking me
all these questions.

197
00:11:25,308 --> 00:11:27,302
I don't know why this girl
is in your dreams.

198
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:30,601
And I don't know, for that matter,
why I'm in your dreams,

199
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,301
but I want to make one thing clear :

200
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:35,502
I hate it here.

201
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:37,502
I hate my life.

202
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:39,902
I pray every night that it'll end.

203
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,702
I don't want visitors.

204
00:11:41,706 --> 00:11:44,103
I don't want friends.

205
00:11:44,105 --> 00:11:46,500
So, if you call me,
I won't answer the phone.

206
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,503
And I won't see you.

207
00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:57,001
It's my husband.

208
00:11:57,005 --> 00:11:58,800
Must be nice.

209
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,102
Bye, Allison.

210
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:06,901
Thanks for the things.

211
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:14,900
<i>Please do not disturb.
Enjoy Plaza Hotel</i>

212
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:18,601
It's open.

213
00:12:32,108 --> 00:12:36,101
The concierge said you were looking
for someone to show you around Phoenix.

214
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:42,802
He thought I might know all the places
you were interested in seeing.

215
00:12:51,408 --> 00:12:53,403
You in the shower ?

216
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:58,902
Need any help ?

217
00:12:58,905 --> 00:13:00,900
Nah. I'm okay.

218
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:04,703
The donation for charity
is on the nightstand.

219
00:13:10,605 --> 00:13:12,701
Can I get you a drink ?

220
00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:15,400
Don't worry about me.

221
00:13:15,405 --> 00:13:17,503
Just make yourself comfortable.

222
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:41,401
So, uh... you're my guide ?

223
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:44,701
Anywhere you want to go,
I'm sure I can get you there.

224
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,701
You won't be needing this.

225
00:14:15,906 --> 00:14:17,403
I thought I told you.

226
00:14:17,405 --> 00:14:20,100
- I had another dream.
- I don't care.

227
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:22,801
For God sakes!
The only freedom I have in here is

228
00:14:22,805 --> 00:14:26,902
the freedom to decide whether I want
to see other human beings or not.

229
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:30,102
And you've figured out a way
to take that away from me !

230
00:14:30,105 --> 00:14:32,102
Who do you think you're kidding,

231
00:14:32,108 --> 00:14:33,702
telling them this is police business ?

232
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,800
This isn't police business.

233
00:14:35,806 --> 00:14:38,601
No one's died, nothing's been stolen.

234
00:14:38,605 --> 00:14:42,501
Bethany has crossed paths
with her kidnapper.

235
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:45,900
Bethany recognized
the bite mark on his hand.

236
00:14:45,906 --> 00:14:48,103
Cynthia, I think this is why...

237
00:14:48,108 --> 00:14:51,102
this is why I've been dreaming
about her.

238
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:53,203
I mean, she recognized him.

239
00:14:53,206 --> 00:14:56,202
Who's to say he didn't recognize her ?

240
00:14:56,206 --> 00:15:00,601
And if so, he couldn't just
let her walk out of the room.

241
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,300
I have been making calls all morning.

242
00:15:02,307 --> 00:15:06,203
She hasn't used her credit card,
her cell phone.

243
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:09,303
She hasn't pickeup her mail in a week.

244
00:15:12,908 --> 00:15:16,200
You know, Allison...

245
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,800
after you left the last time,

246
00:15:18,806 --> 00:15:23,201
I used up all my phone privileges
to try and get in touch with Bethany.

247
00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:24,202
When that didn't work,

248
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:26,200
I swapped all the stuff
that you brought

249
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,203
and bought myself some more.

250
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:31,102
I called every old number
I had for Bethany.

251
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:32,903
Left messages.

252
00:15:32,907 --> 00:15:38,502
I called every cop, ery parole officer,
every youth counselor.

253
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,603
And, you know...

254
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:47,602
...for those 40 minutes, it was like...

255
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:51,202
I wasn't in here at all.

256
00:15:51,207 --> 00:15:53,803
Did anything come of it ?

257
00:15:53,806 --> 00:15:57,703
Did you make any connections ?

258
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,900
No.

259
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:40,401
There's nothing left.
It's all gone, man. You guys are done !

260
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:43,102
It's all gone.

261
00:16:43,105 --> 00:16:47,100
Just have the office furniture
guy give me a call

262
00:16:47,108 --> 00:16:49,600
when you get to the warehouse
with a figure, all right ?

263
00:16:53,006 --> 00:16:54,703
This mine or this yours ?

264
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,203
Well, that depends. Who are you ?

265
00:16:57,206 --> 00:17:00,501
My name is Simon Burwell.
I own Tesseract Industrial.

266
00:17:00,506 --> 00:17:01,500
You are ?

267
00:17:01,508 --> 00:17:04,600
My name's Joe Dubois. That's yours.

268
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,503
Just make sure you turn off
all the lights when you're done.

269
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:08,902
Where are you going ?

270
00:17:08,907 --> 00:17:10,803
Oh, I've been told I have
to hire a really good lawyer

271
00:17:10,807 --> 00:17:15,602
so I can make you pay through
the nose when you try to settle with me.

272
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:17,903
What if I don't want
to settle with you ?

273
00:17:17,908 --> 00:17:22,301
What if I want to honor your contract,
have you work for me ?

274
00:17:25,705 --> 00:17:29,302
My wife put you up to this ?

275
00:17:29,306 --> 00:17:30,703
I mean, frankly,

276
00:17:30,706 --> 00:17:33,101
I could hire a mediocre engineer
at half what you're going to cost me

277
00:17:33,105 --> 00:17:36,303
to see this project through
to market, but

278
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:38,302
I'd rather have a great engineer.

279
00:17:38,305 --> 00:17:41,601
You know, I'd rather have
the guy who cooked the whole thing up.

280
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:43,203
I hear a "but" in there.
Where's the "but" ?

281
00:17:43,205 --> 00:17:44,902
No, no. No "buts."

282
00:17:44,908 --> 00:17:47,302
None of consequence, anyways.

283
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:49,703
How do you feel about the ocean ?

284
00:17:49,705 --> 00:17:53,702
You're going to drown me if
I don't come work for you ?

285
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:57,203
We're in San Diego, Joe.
We're all in San Diego.

286
00:17:57,207 --> 00:17:58,800
It's beautiful.

287
00:17:58,806 --> 00:18:01,600
You know, it's whe we started,
and it's, uh, it's where we're staying,

288
00:18:01,607 --> 00:18:04,700
and it's where you gotta be
if you want to stay with your baby.

289
00:18:04,707 --> 00:18:07,400
I've got a daughter who's
halfway through high school.

290
00:18:07,407 --> 00:18:09,601
My wife works for the local DA.

291
00:18:09,607 --> 00:18:11,601
We have great schools.

292
00:18:11,606 --> 00:18:13,901
I don't know what kind of work
your wife does, but if she's good,

293
00:18:13,905 --> 00:18:16,502
we could throw our weight around,
we could make some calls.

294
00:18:16,507 --> 00:18:19,101
We're a big presence in San Diego.

295
00:18:19,106 --> 00:18:20,600
It's not that simple.

296
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:22,201
It is.

297
00:18:22,907 --> 00:18:24,102
We'll buy your house here.

298
00:18:24,105 --> 00:18:25,903
We'll help you find a house there.

299
00:18:25,908 --> 00:18:28,700
You know, we do this all the time.

300
00:18:28,706 --> 00:18:31,602
Did I mention the ocean ?

301
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:35,601
Special delivery for Mrs. Dubois.

302
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:36,700
What's this ?

303
00:18:36,806 --> 00:18:39,700
It's all the files on the Bethany Simmons
kidnap from 11 years ago;

304
00:18:39,705 --> 00:18:42,102
I thought maybe you'd want
to look through those.

305
00:18:42,108 --> 00:18:43,003
Thanks.

306
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:44,901
I appreciate this.

307
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:46,400
I appreciate all of this,

308
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:50,502
especially knowing how busy you are
running around looking for that hothead,

309
00:18:50,507 --> 00:18:51,902
Christopher Sipes' wife.

310
00:18:51,908 --> 00:18:54,503
Manny didn't tell you ?

311
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,502
All that went away.

312
00:18:56,508 --> 00:18:58,100
Sipes phoned this morning.

313
00:18:58,108 --> 00:18:59,800
Turns out the wife's okay.

314
00:18:59,808 --> 00:19:03,002
She called him last night
from a resort in Ixtapa, Mexico.

315
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,800
Just felt the two of them needed
a little break.

316
00:19:05,805 --> 00:19:09,503
Are you saying that this woman left
the country without telling her husband ?

317
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:11,601
That so hard to believe ?
You met the guy.

318
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:13,402
Frankly, I think she showed
remarkable restraint

319
00:19:13,406 --> 00:19:15,301
by staying in the same hemisphere.

320
00:19:19,906 --> 00:19:22,101
Hello ?

321
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:23,503
I'm home.

322
00:19:23,505 --> 00:19:24,900
It's about time.

323
00:19:24,908 --> 00:19:27,900
Your dinner's in the fridge.

324
00:19:27,908 --> 00:19:30,803
Where've you been ? I was about
to send ou the Phoenix Mounties.

325
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:32,703
Mm, bookstore.

326
00:19:37,007 --> 00:19:37,900
GRAND CAYON
THE BIGGEST HOLE ON EARTH

327
00:19:37,906 --> 00:19:39,400
Who went to the Grand Canyon ?

328
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:40,803
Nobody we know.

329
00:19:43,106 --> 00:19:43,800
"I have your daughter.

330
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:47,501
"I will return her in exchange
for $2 million.

331
00:19:47,506 --> 00:19:50,603
Contact the police and she will die."

332
00:19:50,605 --> 00:19:53,703
Yeah, ransom note. Pretty cute, huh ?

333
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:58,403
11 years ago, Bethany Simmons'
kidnapper sent this note to her parents.

334
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,202
The police recovered
a partial fingerprint,

335
00:20:00,206 --> 00:20:02,402
but they could never figure out
who it belonged to.

336
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:04,201
So he just got away with $2 million ?

337
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,501
Yup.

338
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:09,703
What did you get,

339
00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:12,103
a set of encyclopedias ?

340
00:20:17,808 --> 00:20:20,600
What's with all these books
on San Diego ?

341
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:24,302
I met my new boss today.

342
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:25,500
What do you want me to say ?

343
00:20:25,506 --> 00:20:26,402
Well, I don't know, Allison.

344
00:20:26,406 --> 00:20:28,102
What do you want me to say ?

345
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:29,500
A guy offers me a job

346
00:20:29,506 --> 00:20:31,303
doing something that
I desperately want to do

347
00:20:31,307 --> 00:20:32,902
at a time in history when no one,

348
00:20:32,907 --> 00:20:35,903
no one is getting offered
any kind of a job.

349
00:20:35,906 --> 00:20:38,303
And, yeah, holy crap, there's a little,
you know, there's some inconvenience

350
00:20:38,306 --> 00:20:41,401
and there's, you know,
some sacrifice involved.

351
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:42,902
No, you're right, you're right.
All right,

352
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,600
you know, I'm sorry I brought it up.

353
00:20:44,607 --> 00:20:47,003
Come on, that's not fair.

354
00:20:47,007 --> 00:20:48,400
I mean, Ariel's going to be
a junior next year.

355
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:51,900
She's going to be... she's going
to be applying for college in two years.

356
00:20:51,908 --> 00:20:53,901
Okay, you're not saying anything
that I didn't say.

357
00:20:53,905 --> 00:20:55,900
And, you know, I have a job, too.

358
00:20:55,908 --> 00:20:57,902
Do you think I forgot ?

359
00:20:57,908 --> 00:21:00,801
He said he'd help with that.

360
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:05,800
That's what I did.

361
00:21:06,908 --> 00:21:11,103
I just... I don't think
that we can just say "no."

362
00:21:11,107 --> 00:21:16,702
I mean, it might be a beautiful,
grand, wonderful adventure.

363
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,202
New house.

364
00:21:18,206 --> 00:21:21,100
New climate. New friends.

365
00:21:21,108 --> 00:21:24,900
There are worse things.

366
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:27,103
No. I hear that.

367
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:29,200
I just... I want you to sleep on it.

368
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,300
<i>I mean, I want to sleep on it.</i>

369
00:21:36,407 --> 00:21:40,301
That's right, Mr. Devalos, I, uh,
I just got off the phone with her.

370
00:21:40,305 --> 00:21:42,900
Mexico. Ixtapa.

371
00:21:42,906 --> 00:21:45,000
What did she say ? 

372
00:21:45,007 --> 00:21:47,001
She said that she needed
a little bit of time

373
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:52,400
to think about us,
think about our marriage.

374
00:21:52,407 --> 00:21:56,203
I don't know
 My head is spinning. I'm upset.

375
00:21:56,207 --> 00:21:59,001
I'm embarrassed.

376
00:21:59,007 --> 00:22:03,900
I know, I made an ass
of myself in your office.

377
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:05,400
No, no.

378
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:06,700
You have nothing to be sorry for.

379
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,101
I... apologize.

380
00:22:09,107 --> 00:22:12,101
I have your wife.I will return her in exchange
for $10 million.Contact the police and she dies. 

381
00:22:12,808 --> 00:22:16,300
I guess the important thing is, um...

382
00:22:16,305 --> 00:22:18,303
my wife's just fine.

383
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:31,400
Wait a second. Now you're telling me

384
00:22:31,507 --> 00:22:34,102
that Christopher Sipes' wife,
Amy, has been kidnapped ?

385
00:22:34,108 --> 00:22:37,003
Yes, sir. And I'm almost certain that
she was taken by the same man

386
00:22:37,006 --> 00:22:40,201
who abducted
Bethany Simmons 11 years ago.

387
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:43,603
The ransom note is almost
identical to this one.

388
00:22:43,608 --> 00:22:45,203
And not only that. I think

389
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:49,001
that the kidnapper may have recently
crossed paths with Bethany Simmons.

390
00:22:49,007 --> 00:22:51,102
I think he recognized her.

391
00:22:51,107 --> 00:22:54,203
And I think he did something
terrible to her.

392
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:57,703
Well, this is all very interesting,
Allison, except for one thing.

393
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:01,400
Christopher Sipes has never
contacted us about any kidnapping.

394
00:23:01,407 --> 00:23:04,002
Of course not. He's afraid to.

395
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,901
Read that card again.

396
00:23:08,706 --> 00:23:11,201
"Contact the police and she will die."

397
00:23:11,205 --> 00:23:13,100
This is ridiculous. Amy is fine.

398
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:14,800
I discussed this with you yesterday.

399
00:23:14,806 --> 00:23:16,803
She's-she's in Mexico.

400
00:23:16,807 --> 00:23:19,402
And we heard you, but if, by chance,

401
00:23:19,405 --> 00:23:20,800
she wasn't fine, if, by chance,

402
00:23:20,807 --> 00:23:23,801
there was something else going on...

403
00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:24,901
Well, there's nothing else going,

404
00:23:24,906 --> 00:23:28,803
other than she's looking for a little
bit of peace, little bit of solitude.

405
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,703
Then would you mind terribly if we
contacted her, just to confirm that ?

406
00:23:31,706 --> 00:23:34,703
Yeah. In fact, I would.

407
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:38,602
The woman wants to be left alone.

408
00:23:38,606 --> 00:23:42,803
She's trying to decide whether or not
she wants to be married to me, all right ?

409
00:23:42,805 --> 00:23:44,802
So, I think you two would understand
that I don't want to upset her.

410
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:47,702
I don't want to jeopardize that.

411
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:52,203
If you'd like, when she get back,
I'll have her call your office.

412
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:54,400
So...

413
00:23:54,408 --> 00:23:56,000
Unless there's anything else, you guys...

414
00:23:56,008 --> 00:23:57,803
Actually, there is.

415
00:23:57,805 --> 00:23:59,700
We don't believe that your wife
is spending time alone.

416
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,302
We think she may have been abducted.

417
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:04,700
We think the man who took her
may have kidnapped someone else.

418
00:24:04,707 --> 00:24:07,303
Mr. Sipes, if you won't involve
the authorities wi yr wife's case,

419
00:24:07,307 --> 00:24:11,400
then it's far less likely we'll ever
know what happened to this other victim.

420
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:15,301
I'm sorry to hear that,
but what do you want me to say ?

421
00:24:15,308 --> 00:24:18,102
My wife is not missing.

422
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:21,003
So there's no case in which
to involve you.

423
00:24:25,706 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm home.

424
00:24:27,005 --> 00:24:29,001
You want to hear something weird ?

425
00:24:29,007 --> 00:24:32,500
I want to the pizza store
and they were all out of pizza.

426
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:37,301
He gave me this empty pizza box
to take home so I would stop crying.

427
00:24:39,006 --> 00:24:40,803
Look, he tricked me !

428
00:24:40,806 --> 00:24:43,600
That's not funny. Bad Mommy, right ?

429
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:46,803
Ooh, bad Mommy !

430
00:24:46,806 --> 00:24:48,902
Hey, honey, where's Ariel
and your daddy ?

431
00:24:48,907 --> 00:24:50,400
Well, Ariel's in her room,

432
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:55,203
and well, Daddy's packing
for California.

433
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:57,201
Daddy's going to California ?

434
00:25:00,205 --> 00:25:03,103
California ? I thought we had
this conversation.

435
00:25:03,108 --> 00:25:06,202
Well, we said we'd sleep on it, right ?

436
00:25:06,207 --> 00:25:08,100
Okay, so how did you sleep ?

437
00:25:08,108 --> 00:25:09,902
I slept pretty soundly,
actually pretty good.

438
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,701
I woke up pretty much convinced

439
00:25:11,707 --> 00:25:15,603
it didn't make a lot of sense to work
for a company that was based in San Diego.

440
00:25:15,605 --> 00:25:17,403
I mean, not if they were going
to make me work there, too.

441
00:25:17,408 --> 00:25:19,800
You know? 'Cause we got our roots here

442
00:25:19,805 --> 00:25:21,301
and the kids and the family

443
00:25:21,308 --> 00:25:23,401
and your job and all that, so...

444
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:25,003
Okay, that's kind of how I slept, too.

445
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:26,703
So why are you going to California ?

446
00:25:26,706 --> 00:25:29,203
'Cause this guy Simon Burwell
called me.

447
00:25:29,206 --> 00:25:32,100
I guess he didn't sleep
as soundly as we did.

448
00:25:32,107 --> 00:25:34,501
Well, he didn't call.
His office called.

449
00:25:34,508 --> 00:25:38,003
I guess he's, you know,
he's got a proposition for me.

450
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:41,802
He wants to buy me lunch
tomorrow in San Diego.

451
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,802
He sent me, you know,
a first- class ticket and everything.

452
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:47,002
Okay, but if you're not interested...

453
00:25:47,006 --> 00:25:48,603
See, that is the difference
between you and me.

454
00:25:48,605 --> 00:25:53,002
See, I suspect a lot,
but I know very little.

455
00:25:53,005 --> 00:25:54,902
It's just a proposition.

456
00:25:54,906 --> 00:25:58,902
I mean, there are almost,
like, no jobs out there.

457
00:25:58,908 --> 00:26:03,203
How do I... how do I not even
listen to this guy ?

458
00:26:03,206 --> 00:26:06,701
I made it very clear that
this family is not moving.

459
00:26:06,705 --> 00:26:08,802
Okay, so, just let him woo
you over the phone.

460
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:11,503
The whole trip is going to take,
like, six hours.

461
00:26:11,507 --> 00:26:13,402
I'll be home before dinner.

462
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,803
Speaking of which...

463
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:17,201
It's in the kitchen.
It's the round thing in the square box.

464
00:26:17,205 --> 00:26:19,301
Excellent. My favorite.

465
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:38,102
"I buried your wife an hour ago.

466
00:26:38,107 --> 00:26:40,202
She has approximately 
five minutes of air left."

467
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:41,401
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU DON'T.

468
00:26:45,906 --> 00:26:48,001
Look, I don't... I don't understand.

469
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:50,901
I did what you said.
I brought the money.

470
00:27:03,108 --> 00:27:04,900
What the hell are you doing here ?

471
00:27:04,905 --> 00:27:07,901
I'm sorry. I just had to make
sure I got to you before you left.

472
00:27:07,905 --> 00:27:09,701
Left ? Left for where ?

473
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:11,403
To pay the ransom.

474
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:16,300
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you ?

475
00:27:16,307 --> 00:27:18,003
Mr. Sipes ?

476
00:27:18,007 --> 00:27:20,903
Do you know who I am ?
Do you know what I do ?

477
00:27:20,908 --> 00:27:23,301
I know who you say you are.

478
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,400
I know what you purport to be.

479
00:27:25,405 --> 00:27:28,301
I already saw everything
that's going to happen.

480
00:27:28,307 --> 00:27:30,100
The spot in the desert where
it all takes place.

481
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:35,102
The two green duffle bags that
you're going to use to carry the money.

482
00:27:35,106 --> 00:27:37,300
The kidnapper is going
to double-cross you.

483
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:40,001
When you give him those bags,
he's going to shoot you.

484
00:27:40,005 --> 00:27:43,300
And he's going to leave
your wife there to die.

485
00:27:43,305 --> 00:27:45,300
Please, let me help you.

486
00:27:45,306 --> 00:27:49,201
Call my boss. Tell him
everything you know.

487
00:27:49,205 --> 00:27:51,902
Do you know what I do for a living,
Mrs. Dubois ?

488
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:54,701
I buy and I sell real estate.

489
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:57,800
I do it without lawyers,
without bankers, without brokers.

490
00:27:57,806 --> 00:27:59,502
Just me.

491
00:27:59,506 --> 00:28:03,601
Staring into the eyes of whoever
it is I'm doing business with.

492
00:28:03,607 --> 00:28:05,700
And that's what got me here.

493
00:28:05,705 --> 00:28:09,702
Now, I'm not admitting
that someone has taken my wife.

494
00:28:09,705 --> 00:28:12,602
But if someone ever did...

495
00:28:12,605 --> 00:28:17,003
I'd look them in the eye,
ask them what they wanted,

496
00:28:17,007 --> 00:28:20,302
then make the best damn deal
that I could.

497
00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:23,600
Now, maybe they'd shoot me...

498
00:28:23,605 --> 00:28:25,300
but I doubt it.

499
00:28:25,305 --> 00:28:28,303
It's bad business.

500
00:28:28,305 --> 00:28:30,602
There's no upside.

501
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:35,203
But you wouldn't understand that.

502
00:28:35,207 --> 00:28:38,103
That's why I live in this big house

503
00:28:38,106 --> 00:28:42,000
and you drive that piece of crap
that you do.

504
00:28:42,006 --> 00:28:44,701
Now, get off of my front porch.

505
00:28:53,005 --> 00:28:53,500
Hello ?

506
00:28:53,506 --> 00:28:55,100
You have a collect call from an inmate

507
00:28:55,107 --> 00:28:57,703
 at the Arizona State
Women's Correctional Facility.

508
00:28:57,705 --> 00:29:01,300
To accept the call,
please press "one."

509
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:02,300
She called !

510
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:03,103
Bethany ?

511
00:29:03,107 --> 00:29:05,400
Yeah. Bethany. She called.

512
00:29:05,405 --> 00:29:08,801
Her parole officer gave
her the message and she called.

513
00:29:08,805 --> 00:29:11,300
You're kidding. What did she say ?
Where has she been ?

514
00:29:11,305 --> 00:29:13,903
Off the wagon, doing drugs, worse.

515
00:29:13,908 --> 00:29:16,403
She wanted me to know she was
on top of it.

516
00:29:16,405 --> 00:29:20,603
She started meetings yesterday.
She's 24 hours clean and sober

517
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:22,801
and she sounded pretty positive.

518
00:29:22,807 --> 00:29:24,502
Well, that's great.

519
00:29:24,507 --> 00:29:27,603
I told her that, um, if she, uh,

520
00:29:27,606 --> 00:29:31,000
you know, felt like coming by,
I'd like to see her.

521
00:29:31,006 --> 00:29:36,300
And, um, same goes for you,
if, you know,

522
00:29:36,305 --> 00:29:39,802
you'd like to drop by and visit.

523
00:29:39,807 --> 00:29:41,400
Of course.

524
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,203
Okay. I got to go.

525
00:29:43,207 --> 00:29:45,000
Oh, Cynthia.

526
00:29:45,005 --> 00:29:47,203
Thanks for calling.

527
00:29:47,205 --> 00:29:49,603
Yeah, okay. Bye.

528
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:55,700
Mr. Burwell.

529
00:29:55,705 --> 00:29:56,803
Sorry. Am I late ?

530
00:29:56,805 --> 00:29:58,303
- No, no. No, you're early.
- Oh, good.

531
00:29:58,308 --> 00:30:00,102
I'm just earlier.

532
00:30:00,106 --> 00:30:01,100
Okay.

533
00:30:01,106 --> 00:30:02,403
Please call me Simon.

534
00:30:02,408 --> 00:30:04,402
Simon. Thank you. Thank you.

535
00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:08,503
Did I mention the ocean ?

536
00:30:10,006 --> 00:30:12,803
I just, uh... Oh, God.

537
00:30:12,805 --> 00:30:15,203
I don't know how I'm going
to make this work.

538
00:30:15,205 --> 00:30:17,303
It's a family thing, right ?

539
00:30:17,307 --> 00:30:20,300
Moving ? I get that.

540
00:30:20,307 --> 00:30:24,602
I just... You know, I really hate
the idea of doing this without you.

541
00:30:24,608 --> 00:30:27,903
I don't know what to tell you.

542
00:30:27,907 --> 00:30:29,303
All right. Okay.

543
00:30:29,305 --> 00:30:30,901
We're engineers.

544
00:30:30,905 --> 00:30:32,601
We're supposed to be problem solvers.

545
00:30:32,608 --> 00:30:34,002
Solution brokers.

546
00:30:34,007 --> 00:30:36,500
Let me... let me hit you
with a potential solution.

547
00:30:36,508 --> 00:30:40,100
All right ?
You tell me what you think.

548
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:41,903
Don't leave Phoenix.

549
00:30:41,908 --> 00:30:43,001
My God, you're a genius.

550
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,601
Yeah, hold that thought.

551
00:30:44,607 --> 00:30:46,800
What I meant to say was, um...

552
00:30:46,806 --> 00:30:48,400
Don't have your family leave Phoenix.

553
00:30:48,406 --> 00:30:50,703
You know, they stay put.
You come here.

554
00:30:50,706 --> 00:30:52,300
Like you did today.
You get on a plane.

555
00:30:52,307 --> 00:30:53,601
You do your work. Finish your work.

556
00:30:53,608 --> 00:30:55,201
You get back on a plane.

557
00:30:55,207 --> 00:30:56,901
So, I would work here for,
like, five days a week ?

558
00:30:56,906 --> 00:30:58,003
Yeah.

559
00:30:58,007 --> 00:30:59,601
A lot of people do it.

560
00:30:59,605 --> 00:31:01,302
Yeah, I know. I know a lot of pple dot.

561
00:31:01,307 --> 00:31:03,200
I just... I don't think that I could.

562
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:05,602
Being a husband and a father,
you know, just for weekends,

563
00:31:05,605 --> 00:31:08,302
I don't think that's going
to work for us.

564
00:31:08,306 --> 00:31:11,003
I don't think that's going
to work for me.

565
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:13,800
All right. Okay. Let me reengineer this.

566
00:31:13,806 --> 00:31:16,903
What if I said I want you
in San Diego three days a week ?

567
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:18,203
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

568
00:31:18,206 --> 00:31:22,102
Then Monday, Friday you stay in Phoenix,
telecommute from home.

569
00:31:22,107 --> 00:31:23,602
Tesseract will pay all your travel,

570
00:31:23,606 --> 00:31:25,901
set you up with an apartment here.

571
00:31:25,907 --> 00:31:27,502
And that way, you see your kids.

572
00:31:27,505 --> 00:31:29,400
See your wife.

573
00:31:29,407 --> 00:31:32,502
And you get to finish what you started.

574
00:31:32,507 --> 00:31:37,302
And... And I will still throw
in the ocean.

575
00:31:39,808 --> 00:31:41,501
I'm home !

576
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:43,503
Daddy's home !

577
00:31:44,408 --> 00:31:46,100
I told you I would be home
before dinner.

578
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:48,303
Hey, what's in the bag ?

579
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:49,603
What's in the bag ?

580
00:31:54,507 --> 00:31:56,203
San Diego ?

581
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:59,302
I got one for everyone.

582
00:32:05,306 --> 00:32:06,100
You have to admit,

583
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:09,603
this man is twisting himself into
a pretzel to make this thing work.

584
00:32:09,605 --> 00:32:11,303
Okay, I admit it.
Do I have to like it, too ?

585
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:13,803
Allison, this is a chance
for me to see this thing through.

586
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,902
To its completion.

587
00:32:15,908 --> 00:32:18,103
- And this means everything to me.
- No, I know that.

588
00:32:18,108 --> 00:32:21,702
This could mean everything
to our future.

589
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:24,603
And it's a chance for me
to keep working.

590
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:27,602
I don't think you understand
how bleak it is out there.

591
00:32:27,607 --> 00:32:29,301
- No, I do.
- Okay, then.

592
00:32:29,307 --> 00:32:32,202
Well, tell me that
you're okay with this.

593
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:34,003
I'm okay with this.

594
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:36,203
Really ? 'Cause you don't look okay,
Allison.

595
00:32:36,207 --> 00:32:39,002
I mean, I really...
I don't think that you truly understand.

596
00:32:39,007 --> 00:32:41,503
I understand. I understand.
Three nights and three days,

597
00:32:41,507 --> 00:32:44,102
each and every week,
you're not going to be here.

598
00:32:44,107 --> 00:32:45,201
And it's...

599
00:32:45,206 --> 00:32:48,701
It's not that I'm afraid that my life
is going to get that much harder.

600
00:32:49,327 --> 00:32:52,220
I'm just sad about all
the things you're going to miss.

601
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,881
The homework you're not going
to be able to help with.

602
00:32:55,408 --> 00:32:57,191
The tucking in, the kisses good night

603
00:32:57,195 --> 00:32:58,490
you're not going to be able
to give them.

604
00:32:58,988 --> 00:33:00,271
But I get it.

605
00:33:00,505 --> 00:33:01,702
I get all the rest of it.

606
00:33:01,838 --> 00:33:03,842
You have a dream.
We got a mortgage to pay.

607
00:33:03,847 --> 00:33:05,082
I get that.

608
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,483
And even though I'm sad for them,
and I'm sad for me,

609
00:33:09,377 --> 00:33:11,003
I really am happy for you.

610
00:33:11,337 --> 00:33:13,061
You just can't see that.

611
00:33:14,435 --> 00:33:16,550
Or maybe I can't show that
to you right now,

612
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:17,932
and I'm sorry about that.

613
00:33:25,745 --> 00:33:27,111
Are you awake ?

614
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:28,681
N... No.

615
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:33,172
I'll miss you.

616
00:33:36,446 --> 00:33:38,452
I already miss you.

617
00:33:39,356 --> 00:33:41,680
Well, that's your own fault--
I haven't even left yet,

618
00:33:41,697 --> 00:33:43,943
and you're already acting
like I'm gone.

619
00:33:44,475 --> 00:33:45,603
Shut up.

620
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,172
We'll tell the kids in the morning ?

621
00:33:54,207 --> 00:33:55,773
Tell the kids in the morning.

622
00:33:55,976 --> 00:33:57,391
And it's good news, right ?

623
00:33:57,558 --> 00:33:59,512
Not the going-away part,
but the job part.

624
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:01,981
Seeing something through
till its finished part.

625
00:34:02,926 --> 00:34:04,101
It's good news.

626
00:34:05,265 --> 00:34:06,932
So, what happened with the girl,
the missing girl ?

627
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:07,963
Did you find her ?

628
00:34:09,827 --> 00:34:10,981
Do you really care ?

629
00:34:11,247 --> 00:34:13,270
Yeah, I care-- I mean,
I care about you, so yeah.

630
00:34:13,817 --> 00:34:15,200
I... I care.

631
00:34:17,237 --> 00:34:19,992
Well, turns out she never
really was missing.

632
00:34:21,656 --> 00:34:22,871
I was wrong.

633
00:34:23,988 --> 00:34:26,743
Seems like I'm wrong about
so many things lately.

634
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:44,320
You all right ?

635
00:34:45,685 --> 00:34:47,220
You look like you just saw a ghost.

636
00:34:48,926 --> 00:34:50,301
Sorry.

637
00:34:52,245 --> 00:34:54,112
You ever get that thing, um...

638
00:34:54,946 --> 00:34:57,442
where you see somebody really familiar ?

639
00:34:58,358 --> 00:35:01,932
For a second there in the dark you just
looked like someone I used to know.

640
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:05,393
Somebody you like ?

641
00:35:07,058 --> 00:35:08,183
Yeah.

642
00:35:09,896 --> 00:35:11,382
It was a long time ago, though.

643
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:13,801
I'm sure he wouldn't recognize me now.

644
00:35:20,706 --> 00:35:22,200
Yeah, I liked him.

645
00:35:23,578 --> 00:35:25,503
I'm sure I'll probably like you, too.

646
00:35:26,706 --> 00:35:28,080
Oh, I'm certain of it.

647
00:35:32,978 --> 00:35:36,623
You know, seeing you like that,
all wet, it's kind of sexy.

648
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:41,331
I was thinking I might need a shower,

649
00:35:41,946 --> 00:35:44,351
and a big, strong man to soap me up.

650
00:35:46,648 --> 00:35:48,793
Yeah. Let's do it.

651
00:35:49,545 --> 00:35:51,810
How about you run on in there
and get the water going,

652
00:35:51,828 --> 00:35:53,372
I'll be right behind you.

653
00:36:14,695 --> 00:36:16,810
Christopher Dennis Sipes.

654
00:36:26,946 --> 00:36:28,382
Would you just give me a second ?

655
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:33,720
Hey, Allison.

656
00:36:37,047 --> 00:36:38,802
What's with the armed escort ?

657
00:36:39,227 --> 00:36:41,660
They're for you. So's this.

658
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:49,191
- Clothes ?
- Cynthia,

659
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:52,402
the dream I told you about,
it happened.

660
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:55,202
Bethany crossed paths with
the man who kidnapped her.

661
00:36:55,378 --> 00:36:57,882
Only he didn't recognize her;
she recognized him.

662
00:36:58,037 --> 00:36:59,423
Allison, calm down.

663
00:36:59,507 --> 00:37:01,631
I told you, she called, she's fine.

664
00:37:02,037 --> 00:37:03,920
No. No, Cynthia, she is not fine.

665
00:37:03,936 --> 00:37:05,292
She's in real trouble.

666
00:37:05,736 --> 00:37:06,942
The reason that she called you is,

667
00:37:06,956 --> 00:37:09,372
she wanted you to stop asking
people where she was.

668
00:37:09,517 --> 00:37:11,130
She didn't want anyone to know.

669
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:12,671
Know ? Know what ?

670
00:37:12,866 --> 00:37:14,800
That she had decided to get even.

671
00:37:15,188 --> 00:37:16,830
She got his name and address.

672
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:19,050
She kidnapped his wife.

673
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:22,130
Cynthia, once this man,
Christopher Sipes,

674
00:37:22,138 --> 00:37:24,953
makes that ransom drop,
Bethany plans on shooting him

675
00:37:25,086 --> 00:37:27,590
and leaving his wife to die
in a shallow grave.

676
00:37:28,715 --> 00:37:30,040
I saw it, Cynthia.

677
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:34,342
Look, I'm worried that
he has already gone to make the drop.

678
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,363
It the perfect revenge.

679
00:37:37,786 --> 00:37:41,792
She even has Sipes making the drop at
the exact same place where he buried her,

680
00:37:41,866 --> 00:37:44,270
in the middle of the desert,
in the middle of nowhere.

681
00:37:44,778 --> 00:37:48,241
And no one who worked the original
case knows exactly where that was.

682
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,252
No one really knows.

683
00:37:50,885 --> 00:37:52,062
Except Bethany.

684
00:37:53,296 --> 00:37:54,430
And you.

685
00:38:11,795 --> 00:38:12,743
Bethany.

686
00:38:17,157 --> 00:38:17,843
Well...

687
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:19,793
long time, no see.

688
00:38:21,127 --> 00:38:22,773
Didn't I just call you in prison ?

689
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,411
What the hell are you doing here ?

690
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:29,623
I had a pang of nostalgia.

691
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:32,091
I told the police

692
00:38:32,097 --> 00:38:34,901
I'd be able to lead them
to a scene of a kidnapping.

693
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:36,993
I told them that, uh,

694
00:38:37,005 --> 00:38:39,760
I could get the kidnapper
to come with me quietly,

695
00:38:41,356 --> 00:38:44,083
stop her from making
a terrible mistake.

696
00:38:46,047 --> 00:38:47,431
Come on, Bethany.

697
00:38:48,296 --> 00:38:50,472
You're many things,
but you're not stupid.

698
00:38:50,847 --> 00:38:53,921
They've got sharpshooters
all around here, behind every rock,

699
00:38:54,455 --> 00:38:57,120
just waiting for an opportunity
to pull the trigger.

700
00:38:57,927 --> 00:39:00,130
It's a win-win situation for them.

701
00:39:00,145 --> 00:39:03,073
As far as they're concerned,
you've buried a woman alive.

702
00:39:04,307 --> 00:39:06,523
But we know that's not true, don't we ?

703
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,982
We know you'd never let that happen,

704
00:39:11,448 --> 00:39:13,391
not after what happened to you.

705
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:18,850
So give me the gun.

706
00:39:20,408 --> 00:39:22,590
Give me the gun and tell me
where the lady is.

707
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:23,993
Why are you doing this ?

708
00:39:24,086 --> 00:39:25,841
You know that he deserves to die.

709
00:39:26,587 --> 00:39:27,793
Yes, and he will.

710
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,992
But not by your hand.

711
00:39:37,578 --> 00:39:38,690
You know...

712
00:39:39,918 --> 00:39:41,830
when I shot my daughter's killer,

713
00:39:43,707 --> 00:39:46,001
I was so certain of what I was doing.

714
00:39:47,566 --> 00:39:50,602
But I was walking around with
this big hole inside me.

715
00:39:52,338 --> 00:39:55,270
And I thought if I killed her,
it would all just go away.

716
00:39:56,676 --> 00:39:57,992
But you know what ?

717
00:39:59,876 --> 00:40:02,111
I still miss my daughter every day.

718
00:40:04,257 --> 00:40:06,773
And I've still got this hole inside me.

719
00:40:09,786 --> 00:40:10,531
Now...

720
00:40:10,868 --> 00:40:12,563
give me that gun, Bethany.

721
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:15,991
What about Sipes ?

722
00:40:16,337 --> 00:40:17,483
What happens to him ?

723
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,193
Oh, he'll get what he deserves.

724
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:28,042
You know, he left a fingerprint on that
ransom note that he sent to your parents,

725
00:40:28,736 --> 00:40:32,242
and we can match that bite mark
on his hand to your teeth.

726
00:40:32,987 --> 00:40:34,542
It's all over for him.

727
00:40:37,165 --> 00:40:39,550
He already took
your mother and your father.

728
00:40:41,845 --> 00:40:43,700
Don't give him you, too.

729
00:40:47,188 --> 00:40:48,512
That's my girl.

730
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:52,391
Good girl.

731
00:40:57,106 --> 00:40:58,193
Good girl.

732
00:41:12,368 --> 00:41:14,420
Well, they just found Amy Sipes.

733
00:41:15,025 --> 00:41:17,313
She was groggy,
but she was still alive.

734
00:41:17,445 --> 00:41:19,563
She was exactly where
Bethany said she'd be.

735
00:41:20,496 --> 00:41:22,361
I knew Bethany couldn't hurt her.

736
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:26,181
Well, there's my ride.

737
00:41:31,665 --> 00:41:33,050
Thanks. No,

738
00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:34,420
thank you for...

739
00:41:35,338 --> 00:41:36,440
for doing this.

740
00:41:40,517 --> 00:41:41,461
Cynthia.

741
00:41:43,258 --> 00:41:45,203
You have a parole hearing
coming up soon.

742
00:41:45,697 --> 00:41:47,401
Yeah. My first.

743
00:41:47,487 --> 00:41:48,932
Well, my boss wants to go.

744
00:41:49,908 --> 00:41:53,222
He wants to speak on your behalf to tell
the board about evything you did here.

745
00:41:53,575 --> 00:41:54,772
If that's okay.

746
00:41:55,418 --> 00:41:58,310
Tell him to come on by
if he wants to discuss it.

747
00:42:00,697 --> 00:42:02,943
Make sure he brings you with him.
