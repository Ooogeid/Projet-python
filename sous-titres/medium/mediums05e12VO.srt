Good God Almighty.</i>

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,250
He's got it all here.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,699
When school starts, when school gets out,

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,750
clubs they go to, friends' houses.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,500
I want a detail on that house 24 hours a day until we find this lunatic.

6
00:00:13,503 --> 00:00:14,849
This is Allison Dubois.

7
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,900
And this is Lucas Harvey.

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,200
What do you want?

9
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,990
God has a plan, and there's no room in it for prophets.

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,500
For seers.

11
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:28,450
You and the Almighty will be discussing it face to face.

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,650
It's holy water.

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,300
To cleanse you with.

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,600
You okay?

15
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,800
You hurt?

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,900
Look, Joe,

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,600
I'm contemplating a stock purchase.

18
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:51,300
I...

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,900
need some advice on which way to jump.

20
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
Markets and finances--

21
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:56,900
that's really not something that I know a lot about.

22
00:00:56,901 --> 00:00:58,949
From your wife, Joe.

23
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,940
This is an article about them.

24
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:03,504
I can't read it because there's a doll-shaped hole cut in it.

25
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:04,300
Yeah.

26
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,700
You got to tell your boss to buy that stock.

27
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:08,550
It's gonna go up today, way up.

28
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,700
Did you happen to check the market when it closed this evening?

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,450
I guess they were up...

30
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,600
a little bit before lunch.

31
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,450
And then they just fell off the face of the earth.

32
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,990
I got to start laying people off.

33
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,600
You okay?

34
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,400
Sir, do you think some water would help?

35
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,500
I think this guy's a dentist.

36
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,650
The one who keeps gassing these girls.

37
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,900
This looks like a picture of the woman that I dreamt about.

38
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:41,400
But she looks dead.

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,800
That's because she is dead.

40
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:44,900
That's not possible. I saw it.

41
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:45,990
You saw wrong.

42
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,950
Hello, Allison.

43
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,806
Dreams don't just happen.

44
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:53,600
They have to come from somewhere.

45
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,102
And for the last little while,

46
00:01:55,103 --> 00:01:57,200
your dreams have been coming from me.

47
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,900
Sweet dreams...

48
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,200
bitch!

53
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,200
Joe?

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,700
Hey.

55
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,000
Whatcha doing?

56
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,030
Oh, I don't know.

57
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,100
Thinking about taking up smoking again, actually.

58
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,600
Well, don't do that.

59
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,200
All right, if you say so.

60
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,600
I am so, so sorry.

61
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,300
I don't know how to do it.

62
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,300
I don't know how to fire these people.

63
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,800
I kept lying in bed,

64
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:43,000
and I just go over and over it in my head,

65
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:43,900
and I just...

66
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,800
can't figure out how to do it.

67
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,250
I know what happened now.

68
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,600
Why I dreamt that dream about the stocks and how it all went so wrong.

69
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,800
It was Lucas Harvey.

70
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,200
What was Lucas Harvey?

71
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,401
He's taken control of my dreams.

72
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:07,808
He's changing them.

73
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,700
He's making sure that all of them are untrue.

74
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,070
It's his way of making me irrelevant.

75
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,903
He thinks that he, uh,

76
00:04:15,904 --> 00:04:19,900
is restoring some kind of balance between good and evil in the world.

77
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,650
He's on some kind of...

78
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,860
mission from God.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,500
You're not saying anything.

80
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,850
I don't care.

81
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,100
He's dead.

82
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,800
The people I have to fire tomorrow...

83
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,200
they're still alive.

84
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,200
You coming in?

85
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,850
Maybe in a while.

86
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,950
<i>Girls...</i>

87
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,990
I asked you not to cut up my paper anymore.

88
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,999
It wasn't me.

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,999
It was Marie.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,900
She loves cutting dolls out of the stock market listings.

91
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:24,400
Marie, honey,

92
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:28,100
I told you that you can't cut up Daddy's paper to make your dolls anymore.

93
00:05:28,102 --> 00:05:29,900
This is Maye and this is Wilt.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,300
Wilt? What kind name is that?

95
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:34,800
That's a girl doll, and you can't call it Wilt.

96
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,100
Honey, she can call it whatever she wants.

97
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:38,238
But she just... Hey.

98
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,500
You can't cut up Daddy's paper anymore.

99
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:42,950
You know what? Daddy doesn't care anymore.

100
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,839
Daddy has to get into work early

101
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,150
so he can be the first one there this morning.

102
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,990
Why? Is something going on?

103
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,249
Daddy's just got to give a lot of people some really bad news.

104
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,900
Enjoy your dolls, kiddo.

105
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,450
You're only young once.

106
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,100
Maye's buying Wilt's house today.

107
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:04,300
What's that?

108
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:06,100
Maye's buying Wilt's house.

109
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:08,606
Yeah, that's great, you know?

110
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:11,200
But if Maye had actually bothered to read the paper that she's made from,

111
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:16,100
she'd know that it's not a very good time to buy a house.

112
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,100
Bye, Dad.

113
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:19,200
Bye, Dad. Bye, Dad.

114
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,400
you are broken

115
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,899
Allison, I'm glad you're here.

116
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,749
I just got off the phone with Detective Scanlon.

117
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,700
He was wondering if we could meet him in the morgue.

118
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,900
Allison, you okay?

119
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,099
Hmm? I'm fine.

120
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,900
Of course.

121
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,199
ispected by #8

122
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,130
They found this deep in the nasal cavity of Trisha Daniels.

123
00:06:54,131 --> 00:06:57,550
Clearly,omeone took the time to roll it up, insert it.

124
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,650
I'm guessing he used a set of tweezers.

125
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,040
Anyway, I had them go back

126
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:05,200
and take another look at the body of the first victim, Carrie Denton.

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,700
And?

128
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,450
Well, same kind of tag-- left nasal cavity.

129
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:12,307
What are you telling me, our killer likes to mark his victims,

130
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:14,849
likes to leave a kind of signature?

131
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,300
This guy takes pride in his work.

132
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,449
Just to be sure, I called the coroner in Scottsdale.

133
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,099
He took another look at the body of Cassidy Pierson. Mom?

134
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,740
Same thing, same place.

135
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,804
Okay, well, I suppose that's progress.

136
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:29,050
- Mommy?
- Well, it gets better.

137
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,806
They managed to lift a partial fingerprint off the tag they pulled out of Trisha Daniels.

138
00:07:33,807 --> 00:07:35,837
We're running it now. Do you have a sense...

139
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:36,900
Mommy?

140
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,405
Please...

141
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,900
What's going on?

142
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,000
Well, that...

143
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,450
well, that depends.

144
00:08:04,405 --> 00:08:05,750
What do you see?

145
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,300
What do you mean?

146
00:08:09,645 --> 00:08:11,500
I mean the body on the slab.

147
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,800
Do you... do you recognize it?

148
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,602
Um, that's, uh, Trisha Daniels.

149
00:08:18,603 --> 00:08:20,750
That's the third victim.

150
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,600
Why?

151
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,900
Is that what you see?

152
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,950
There's nothing else there.

153
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,700
Allison, what's going on?

154
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,040
Nothing.

155
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,450
Ah, it's a joke.

156
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,030
A person-- not even a person--is trying to make a hideous joke.

157
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,990
Well, I would wish him dead, but...

158
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:47,300
that would be beside the point.

159
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:54,900
Mr. Dubois?

160
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,201
Hi, Rachel.

161
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,800
I just wanted to give you this.

162
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:00,950
It has mlatest contact info.

163
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,549
I just thought... should things change,

164
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,400
I would love to come back.

165
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,900
Oh, really?

166
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,099
Well, I thought you'd all go head out to a bar someplace

167
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,600
and burn me in effigy.

168
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,499
No. Hey, y were a great boss.

169
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,900
And... we read the papers.

170
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,200
Actually, a lot of us already have temp work lined up at WILT.

171
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,149
WILT?

172
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,800
Yeah, Worldwide Integrated Logistics and Technologies.

173
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:29,300
They just set up camp at Plaza Industrial Park.

174
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,149
I don't think I'm familiar with them.

175
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,200
It's a new start-up.

176
00:09:32,201 --> 00:09:35,449
But the good news is in this economy they still need people.

177
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,950
Their business is going great.

178
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,104
Actually, I heard a rumor

179
00:09:38,105 --> 00:09:40,200
that Maye Consolidated might buy them up.

180
00:09:42,403 --> 00:09:43,200
No kidding.

181
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,200
Maye might buy Wilt's house, huh?

182
00:09:47,404 --> 00:09:48,200
I'm sorry?

183
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,010
No, no, nothing.

184
00:09:54,104 --> 00:09:59,200
It's funny how your throat always gets scratchy just when it's time for gym class.

185
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,600
I don't see a thing.

186
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,990
You sit tight.

187
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,300
I'll be right back.

188
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,800
Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord.

189
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,670
That's from Proverbs.

190
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,900
You ever read Proverbs?

191
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,900
You ever heard about hell?

192
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,200
'Cause that's where you're going.

193
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,900
Tell your mother

194
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,304
Lucas Harvey told you he's going to slit your throat

195
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,450
and send your little lying ass straight to hell.

196
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,599
I'm fine. I'm fine.

197
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,300
I'M GOING TO...

198
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,700
No!

199
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,050
Bridge, what is it?

200
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,100
Can't we just sleep with the lights on tonight?

201
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,350
What? Why?

202
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,600
I don't like to sleep with the lights on.

203
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,700
I like to sleep with the lights off.

204
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:12,700
Hey.

205
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,900
Bridge, honey, you haven't been afraid of the dark for a long time.

206
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,900
Can't I just sleep with you and Dad?

207
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,400
Hey.

208
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,100
Lucas Harvey visited Bridgette in school today.

209
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,500
What do you mean he visited?

210
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,800
He's a ghost. She can see him.

211
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,204
She was afraid to tell me.

212
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:41,050
She was afraid she was going to frighten me.

213
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,302
Wait a second.

214
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:43,900
Is there anything to be frightened about?

215
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:49,200
I mean, I don't like the idea of this dead nut-job following my kids around.

216
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,500
Well, honey, there's nothing you can do to stop him.

217
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,599
I mean, I just explained it to her.

218
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,599
He's only a ghost.

219
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,573
He can't actually touch you.

220
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:57,400
He can't actually do anything to you.

221
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,557
Except maybe scare you or bother you.

222
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,450
And even that, only if you let him.

223
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,100
And that worked?

224
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,200
Well, that and allowing her to keep her bathroom light on.

225
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,500
He tried the same thing with me today,

226
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:11,550
and afterwards I realized

227
00:12:11,551 --> 00:12:14,500
the key to making him leave us alone is to ignore him.

228
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,800
Deny him the satisfaction of having any impact on us.

229
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,150
That's the theory anyway.

230
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,900
Let's see if it works.

231
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,430
Hey,hat are you doing out here 11:00 at night on the computer?

232
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:29,200
Well, it's the darnedest thing.

233
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:31,100
I came out here to see if any of the engineering blogs

234
00:12:31,101 --> 00:12:34,005
have gotten wind of the layoffs that I made today,

235
00:12:34,006 --> 00:12:36,150
and I came across this headline.

236
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,400
"Maye Consolidated Makes Formal Offer for WILT."

237
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:43,400
Maye bought WILT's house.

238
00:12:43,701 --> 00:12:46,500
Remember, Marie this morning, with her paper dolls?

239
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,770
I think I've been listing to the wrong psychic.

240
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,400
I don't think it's just a coincidence that Marie always cuts those dolls out of the stock market listings.

241
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:56,104
I think that the names that she gives those dolls have meaning as well.

242
00:12:56,105 --> 00:12:57,144
I mean, "Maye" and "WILT"--

243
00:12:57,145 --> 00:12:59,799
those are four-letter symbols for companies on the Exchange.

244
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,199
Why are you looking at me like that?

245
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,100
I'm just dying to see where you're going with this.

246
00:13:03,102 --> 00:13:04,800
Where I'm going with this is simple.

247
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,800
This morning, Marie looked at the two of us,

248
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,200
and she said "Maye is going to buy Wilt's house today."

249
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,600
And Allison, that is exactly what happened.

250
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,050
Sometime after the stock market closed tonight,

251
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
Maye Consolidated bought WILT.

252
00:13:18,301 --> 00:13:21,247
- They did. Maye bought WILT's house.
- And your point is?

253
00:13:21,248 --> 00:13:24,700
My point is I think maybe our little girl is able to pick winning stocks.

254
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,108
You're joking, right?

255
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:27,100
No, I'm not joking.

256
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:28,119
Joe, she's five years old.

257
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,900
She doesn't even know what a stock is.

258
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:32,400
Be that as it may: Maye bought WILT's house.

259
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,950
May is a month, okay?

260
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:38,164
Wilt is... a basketball player.

261
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:39,144
I'm just saying, look,

262
00:13:39,145 --> 00:13:41,600
is if our little girl happens to disobey me tomorrow

263
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:44,551
and just happens to cut a couple of dolls out of the paper,

264
00:13:44,552 --> 00:13:46,900
let's not be so quick to throw them away.

265
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,845
That is an insane amount of pressure to put on a five-year-old.

266
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:52,499
I'm not going to put any pressure on her.

267
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,000
She's not going to feel any pressure.

268
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:57,100
That is an insane amount of pressure to put on anyone.

269
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,400
Oh, is that what you think?

270
00:13:58,401 --> 00:14:00,149
You think this is about the stock tip that you gave me?

271
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,300
Yeah, I do.

272
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,450
And you know what?

273
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:04,800
I think what's happening to you is horrible.

274
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:06,400
I feel terrible about it.

275
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:07,856
I really wouldn't want that for Marie.

276
00:14:07,857 --> 00:14:09,050
Well, it's not going to happen.

277
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,299
Yeah, well, I hope not.

278
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,900
Well, don't lose any sleep over it.

279
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:13,149
Okay, if you say so.

280
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,820
I say so. Good night.

281
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,550
Good night.

282
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,900
I don't know what kind of cable box I have.

283
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,850
Black.

284
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:27,800
It's black with a silver plate thing on the front.

285
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,730
Look, can I just give yo my account number?

286
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,990
Sure, I'll hold.

287
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,900
Hello. Yes, I have been on hold.

288
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,205
Oh, I would love it if you sent someone.

289
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,800
Thursday would be fine between 10:00 and 2:00.

290
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,400
Yes, it's 3431 Maple Ridge Drive.

291
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,400
3431 Maple Ridge Drive.

292
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,200
Oh, no. Thank you.

293
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:25,200
3431 Maple Ridge Drive.

294
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,050
This is Scanlon.

295
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,600
Hold on a second.

296
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,200
Sorry. I just didn't want to wake Lynn up.

297
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,100
at's up?

298
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,150
I think I saw him.

299
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,400
Saw who?

300
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,300
You know who I'm talking about.

301
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:13,300
I got a good look at his face.

302
00:16:13,562 --> 00:16:17,230
He's got that gas that he uses to knock the girls out in his refrigerator.

303
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,009
- Allison...
- I even got an address. Do you want it?

304
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,902
I don't know. I mean, no offense, Allison,

305
00:16:21,903 --> 00:16:23,201
but after what happened the other day...

306
00:16:23,202 --> 00:16:24,850
Look, no, I know, I get it.

307
00:16:25,015 --> 00:16:25,750
I  DO.

308
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,600
I-I almost didn't even call you.

309
00:16:29,053 --> 00:16:31,300
And I don't know if this address is any good.

310
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,406
But we have nothing. We have no leads.

311
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:35,660
We have no clues.

312
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,200
How do I not call you?

313
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:40,200
When you put it like that, how do I not look?

314
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,500
What's his address?

315
00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:55,200
?.? MAIL

316
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,400
Allison Dubois.

317
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,305
Well, whatever problems you're having with you dreams,

318
00:17:13,306 --> 00:17:14,948
it looks like it's worked itself out.

319
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,200
What are you talking about?

320
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
I'm at 3431 Maple Ridge.

321
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,150
The house belongs to a Kevin Flynn.

322
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,999
Fridge is full of isoflurane valve inhalers.

323
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,450
Bureau drawer is full of pictures of dead women whose faces are beaten to a pulp.

324
00:17:27,451 --> 00:17:28,650
Oh, my goodness.

325
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,400
Is he there?

326
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:30,760
Was he there when you showed up?

327
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,200
Oh, yeah, he's here.

328
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,905
In fact, his brains are splattered

329
00:17:34,906 --> 00:17:36,306
all over the living room wall.

330
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,600
LOOKS LIKE HE KILLED HIMSELF EARLY THIS MORNING.

331
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,300
MAYE SNAPS UP WILT

332
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,800
Getting into the market?

333
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,550
My husband, Joe-- he keeps wanting to invest.

334
00:17:52,901 --> 00:17:53,990
It frightens me.

335
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,750
Care to see the fruits of your dreams?

336
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,303
Turns out the guy was a pharmaceutical sales rep,

337
00:18:02,304 --> 00:18:04,600
which is how I'm assuming he got his hands on these.

338
00:18:04,601 --> 00:18:07,200
We pulled about a dozen of them out of his refrigerator.

339
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,498
He used these to incapacitate his victims.

340
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,437
Then he pummeled them to death wearing those gloves.

341
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,800
There's steel in the knuckles.

342
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,450
Then he posed them, and then he took their photographs.

343
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,503
He lived in Phoenix,

344
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:19,549
but he traveled to Scottsdale on business,

345
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,050
which helps explain why there were victims in both cities.

346
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:24,300
And, you know, just in case there was any doubt,

347
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,959
Flynn had a Ziploc full of these.

348
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,500
"Inspected by #8."

349
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:31,900
I guess he thought that was funny.

350
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,700
You'll recall we found a partial fingerprint on one of those tags.

351
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,300
Forensics just matched it to Kevin Flynn's right index finger.

352
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,800
It's a shame I'm not going to get to prosecute him.

353
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:44,500
This would have been an open-and-shut case.

354
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:47,200
You know what I can't figure out is why he killed himself.

355
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,019
He had no way of knowing I was going to dream about him,

356
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,880
no way of knowing that I would be able to tell you exactly where he lived.

357
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,650
I don't really care why this pervert killed himself.

358
00:18:56,653 --> 00:18:57,800
I'm just glad he did.

359
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,800
Can you keep an eye on all this for a minute till I can send an officer in to gather all this up?

360
00:19:02,801 --> 00:19:03,149
Sure.

361
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,500
Hey, you're back, Allison Dubois.

362
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,550
Nice work.

363
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,200
I second that. Thank you.

364
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,608
But I didn't do anything.

365
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:12,700
I just went sleep, and it just... came to me.

366
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,700
Well, nonetheless.

367
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,500
You're still broken.

368
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,900
"I didn't do anything.

369
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,019
I went to sleep, and it just came to me."

370
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,600
What came to you is what I chose to bring to you.

371
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,750
You're broken, Allison Dubois.

372
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,900
And soon everyone will know it.

373
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,100
And no one will listen.

374
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,990
And all will be as it's meant to be.

375
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,200
Okay. Whatever you say.

376
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,500
We found him and he's dead.

377
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:47,780
I had a dream.

378
00:19:47,782 --> 00:19:51,100
I saw his address, and now it's over.

379
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,355
Maybe.

380
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,299
Mind if I just grab this stuff

381
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,900
and bring it down to the evidence locker?

382
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,450
Ma'am?

383
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,600
Sure.

384
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,400
It's like a death.

385
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,200
For you.

386
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,964
What's this?

387
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:32,600
That's a stock. It's a company.

388
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,700
They manufacture containers.

389
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,999
Huge ones-- the kind you find in ports all over the world.

390
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,500
Except that these containers have special sensors inside them

391
00:20:40,502 --> 00:20:42,994
that monitor their own contents.

392
00:20:42,995 --> 00:20:44,747
And they let you know immediately from the outside

393
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,099
whether or not ty contain any nuclear material,

394
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,900
like the kind you find in a suitcase bomb or a small terrorist weapon.

395
00:20:53,158 --> 00:20:54,499
Why are you showing me this?

396
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,929
Well, I want you to buy it.

397
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,499
Buy the stock, buy the company, whatever you can.

398
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,911
It's going to make you a fortune.

399
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,100
Or at least it's going to put you back where you were,

400
00:21:02,101 --> 00:21:04,300
which means, hopefully, you'll put me back where I was

401
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:06,600
and let me hire back my people and finish my work.

402
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,800
Where'd you get this?

403
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,100
Did you get this from your wife? No.

404
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,500
Then where'd you get it? Does that matter?

405
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:15,700
Does it matter?

406
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:21,099
I bet damn near everything I own on a stock your wife guaranteed.

407
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,913
No, no, no. You pickedhat stock.

408
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,348
You asked for her opinion.

409
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,550
She did the best she could.

410
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:26,900
I'm picking this one.

411
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,200
Pretty cocky for a guy who's done nothing but cost me money.

412
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,001
You're pretty arrogant for a person

413
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,990
who's done nothing but spend money foolishly.

414
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,700
I still own you, Joe.

415
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:42,509
Okay, well, let me put you out of your misery.

416
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,900
I want to buy back my company and my idea from you.

417
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,800
I beg your pardon?

418
00:21:47,851 --> 00:21:48,880
You heard me.

419
00:21:48,881 --> 00:21:50,306
If you don't want to buy this stock, I will,

420
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:52,990
and I'll use the money that I make to buy you out.

421
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,200
Are you insane?

422
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,100
You're not a corporate raider.

423
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,300
Even if that stock does go through the roof,

424
00:22:04,163 --> 00:22:05,800
where are you going to get the money to buy it?

425
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,900
You'd have to invest every penny you own.

426
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,950
If that's what it takes, that's what it takes.

427
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,300
I'm going to do you a huge favor, son.

428
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,700
Save your money.

429
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,500
The business is not for sale.

430
00:22:21,501 --> 00:22:23,600
Your idea is not for sale.

431
00:22:23,601 --> 00:22:25,450
<i>You are not for sale.</i>

432
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,400
I mean it, Terry.

433
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:28,844
I want to buy the business back.

434
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:30,100
Just give me a couple days.

435
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,500
You'll make money off this.

436
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,200
Not for sale.

437
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,609
You weren't serious, were you?

438
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,070
I couldn't be more serious.

439
00:22:41,071 --> 00:22:43,199
Wait. I-I'm confused.

440
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,543
Even if Terry was willing to sell you the business,

441
00:22:45,544 --> 00:22:47,990
what money is it you were planning on pooling together?

442
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,010
Money. Our money. Our savings.

443
00:22:50,012 --> 00:22:51,340
Our retirement account.

444
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,168
You know, I'd take out a second mortgage again on the house,

445
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:55,500
if I had to. Money.

446
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,250
Are you listening to yourself?

447
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,705
You're talking about everything we have,

448
00:22:59,706 --> 00:23:01,109
and what we have is not much.

449
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,700
I'm talking about information that's being supplied by our own daughter.

450
00:23:03,706 --> 00:23:04,800
She's five

451
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,050
Yeah, and she has yet to be wrong about anything, Allison.

452
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:08,768
I've done my research, you know? I checked with her.

453
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:10,029
I've checked out every single stock,

454
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,300
every single doll that she cut out of the paper,

455
00:23:11,301 --> 00:23:13,100
and theye all been huge winners.

456
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:20,300
No! No! I am not having this conversation with a man who's maybe a year away from having a PhD,

457
00:23:20,301 --> 00:23:23,700
who's trying to convince me to listen to a girl's paper dolls.

458
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,799
Oh, so now it's up to me to convince you

459
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,604
that our youngest daughter might be sensitive to things that defy,

460
00:23:28,605 --> 00:23:30,450
uh, rational explanation?

461
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,400
You don't have to convince me of anything.

462
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,950
He's not going to let you buy that business, right?

463
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,300
Right.

464
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,500
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?

465
00:23:55,507 --> 00:23:57,237
Come on, get inside. Hurry up.

466
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,300
Someone is going to see you.

467
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,900
Come on.

468
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,850
You're not supposed to be here.

469
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,740
That's not part of the arrangement.

470
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,350
We're only supposed to talk online. You know that.

471
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,800
You want to explain this?

472
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,288
THE ARIZONA OBSERVER KILLER LEAVES FINGERPRINT

473
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,900
Okay. I made a mistake.

474
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,508
But actually, it's no big deal.

475
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,550
My fingerprints aren't traceable.

476
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,500
I'm not in any system. They can't track me to this.

477
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,500
You think.

478
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,250
Now we're going to have to be even more careful.

479
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,600
I'm thinking we're going to have to slow down.

480
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:40,400
No, no, no. That's crazy.

481
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,889
Nothing has to change.

482
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,400
Here, look.

483
00:24:46,136 --> 00:24:47,990
I was just about toend you these.

484
00:24:49,138 --> 00:24:50,200
They're brand-new.

485
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,800
Don't you want to see them?

486
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,800
Pretty nice, huh?

487
00:25:01,205 --> 00:25:02,554
I thought about you when I saw her.

488
00:25:02,555 --> 00:25:05,400
I mean, she looks like your type, don't you think?

489
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,150
I mean, I know we're not supposed to have a type.

490
00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:10,700
We're supposed to be the same guy and all, but, um...

491
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I don't know.

492
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,600
I saw her and I thought of you.

493
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:19,450
Well, you're upset.

494
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,550
There's no reason to be upset.

495
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,800
We got the perfect setup here.

496
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,399
I get to enjoy your work. You get to enjoy my work.

497
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,300
The police still have no idea that there's two of us.

498
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,406
Honestly, we don't have to stop.

499
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,550
We don't even have to slow down. Not because of that.

500
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,400
So, um, you didn't happen to bring anything for me, did you?

501
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,450
Oh, nice. Nice.

502
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,450
You've got some really... really nice ones here.

503
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,150
Oh, my God, there's two of them.

504
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,700
Hey, Allison.

505
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
It's barely 7:00. What are you doing here?

506
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:19,600
He had a partner. Kevin Flynn was working with a partner.

507
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,804
What are you saying? It was a two-man operation?

508
00:26:23,805 --> 00:26:25,305
One-one would use the gas, and the other...

509
00:26:25,306 --> 00:26:27,603
No, no. It wasn't that kind of a partnership.

510
00:26:27,604 --> 00:26:29,900
It was more like a killers franchise.

511
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,707
Flynn worked here in Phoenix.

512
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:33,203
The other guy worked in Scottsdale.

513
00:26:33,204 --> 00:26:35,323
And they made sure to do everything exactly the same

514
00:26:35,324 --> 00:26:39,040
so that the police will think that there was only one killer.

515
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Why?

516
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,099
I don't know. I...

517
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,600
To throw us off the scent?

518
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,399
I know they enjoyed looking at pictures of each other's work.

519
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,400
The girls.

520
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,100
I suppose that was part of it.

521
00:26:49,102 --> 00:26:51,500
Okay, what does this other guy look like?

522
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,800
Well, actually, I'm not sure.

523
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,860
Well, I don't understand. How did this come to you?

524
00:26:56,862 --> 00:26:57,863
You had a dream?

525
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,550
Yes.

526
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,760
And was he in it?

527
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,500
Well, I wasn't allowed to see him,

528
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:04,800
but that doesn't change the fact that he exists.

529
00:27:04,803 --> 00:27:08,504
All right. Since we c't prove that there really is a partner,

530
00:27:08,505 --> 00:27:11,099
or a collaborator, a fellow franchisee,

531
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,399
and we're not sure what he looks like, if you don't mind,

532
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,300
I'm just going to go on about my day as if he doesn't exist.

533
00:27:19,301 --> 00:27:22,200
Obviously, if you can come up with a description of this man,

534
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:25,201
or some physical evidence that ties him in to at least one of the murders,

535
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:26,200
all that changes.

536
00:27:26,201 --> 00:27:28,005
But I just...

537
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,143
I can't do much with what you've given me.

538
00:27:31,144 --> 00:27:32,150
I'm sorry.

539
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,900
I understand.

540
00:27:40,008 --> 00:27:42,350
Well, that's got to be discouraging.

541
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,300
I mean, you had the dream,

542
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:47,500
but you couldn't see the killer's face.

543
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,150
What happens now?

544
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,700
You can't solve the crime.

545
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,200
Can't get anyone to listen to you.

546
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,880
Well, you're not depressed, are you?

547
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,200
Not suicidal?

548
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,200
Maybe just a little bit?

549
00:28:05,741 --> 00:28:07,100
Are you enjoying this?

550
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,449
Well, I take satisfaction in knowing that I'm enabling God's will.

551
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,900
Yes. "For dreams have deceived many,

552
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,100
and they have failed that put their trust in them."

553
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,500
Ecclesiasticus.

554
00:28:17,003 --> 00:28:21,009
All you're doing is seeing to it that innocent people get killed.

555
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,399
How can that be God's will?

556
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,450
No, no, no.

557
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,200
We're simply allowing people to perish who were meant to perish.

558
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:29,200
"We"?

559
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,800
The Lord and I.

560
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,000
Yes.

561
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,200
You know...

562
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,700
you can put an end to all this, Allison.

563
00:28:37,701 --> 00:28:38,769
Right. I heard you.

564
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,027
Yes. Kill myself.

565
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,750
Well, no. That's not going to happen.

566
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,650
Well, failing that, you could stop dreaming.

567
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,549
Or, at the very least,

568
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,100
stop paying so much attention to what you dream.

569
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,600
That's what the others have done.

570
00:28:52,601 --> 00:28:53,600
"Others"?

571
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:56,400
Well, it's not just you whose dreams I'm editing.

572
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:00,017
Oh, there are many others, all over the world.

573
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,800
Dreamers, meddlers, interlopers.

574
00:29:04,133 --> 00:29:09,700
People like you too ignorant to understand that their interference is unnatural,

575
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,450
an abomination to the truth.

576
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,750
But slowly, I'm teaching all of them to ignore their dreams,

577
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,100
and teaching those around them to ignore the dreamers.

578
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
Allison?

579
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,100
You okay?

580
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,900
Yeah. No.

581
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,950
I'm fine.

582
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,699
Hello, this is Allison Dubois.

583
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,603
I can't get to the phone, but please leave a message,

584
00:29:44,604 --> 00:29:46,600
and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

585
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,050
Hey. It's me.

586
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,306
Um, I justhought you might want to know that,

587
00:29:50,307 --> 00:29:52,299
uh, that stock that Marie found...

588
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,200
The container company? It took off this morning.

589
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:59,200
You know, if we'd invested even one tenth of our savings,

590
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:00,199
we would have had enough money

591
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,402
to put all three girls through whatever college they wanted.

592
00:30:02,403 --> 00:30:03,350
Twice.

593
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,100
Is that petty of me to point that out? Sorry.

594
00:30:07,101 --> 00:30:09,400
I guess I'm feeling a little... petty.

595
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,550
Call me back.

596
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,450
That didn't take long.

597
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,700
Excuse me?

598
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,950
Terry?

599
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
Joe!

600
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,750
I just wanted to offer my congratulations.

601
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,808
Maybe now you'd be willing to tell me who tipped you to that stock.

602
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,420
That's all right.

603
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:35,990
I deserve that.

604
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,045
I was arrogant.

605
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,990
Must feel good to be on the winning side of an equation.

606
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,200
Yeah. Terry, um...

607
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:45,700
Joe, let's be frank.

608
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,500
It's still at least a couple of years before your division

609
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:53,100
even has the possibility of turning a profit.

610
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,430
It's the most speculative venture I am currently funding.

611
00:30:57,431 --> 00:31:00,000
Now, I don't believe for a minute

612
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:04,049
that you could have possibly earned enough off that stock to buy me out,

613
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,300
but it's also clear that you're a clever guy,

614
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,799
not just as an engineer,

615
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,200
but you seem to know your way around the markets as well.

616
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,300
So, I'll tell you what.

617
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,960
If you're still interested, I'll sell you back your company.

618
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,099
I'm not going to let you completely off the hook.

619
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,600
You're going to end up paying me a royalty,

620
00:31:27,601 --> 00:31:32,550
but if you can get together a couple million dollars,

621
00:31:32,551 --> 00:31:35,900
we can figure out how you can pay me the balance over time.

622
00:31:35,901 --> 00:31:37,200
That should work for you,

623
00:31:37,201 --> 00:31:41,000
and it'll give me the chance to get all that red ink

624
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:44,200
your enterprise generates off my balance sheets.

625
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,700
So, what do you say?

626
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,700
A couple million dollars?

627
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,199
No, no, no, no. I'm not going to negotiate over the phone.

628
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,500
I'm just saying, if you still have a desire to do this thing,

629
00:31:55,502 --> 00:31:59,200
then, um, I have half a mind to help you.

630
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,450
Joe? You still there?

631
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,500
Yeah. That's-that's very generous of you, sir.

632
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:10,100
You know, it may take me a little while to put together a couple million dollars.

633
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,550
Don't do the modesty thing. I've already seen you in action.

634
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,100
<i>Come on!</i>

635
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,599
Trade me the Barbershop Bonnie for the Beach Bunny Bonnie!

636
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,990
Please?

637
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:23,900
No!

638
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,556
You girls ready for bed?

639
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:27,500
No... No.

640
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:31,250
What you doing, hmm? Playing with dolls?

641
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,700
Yeah, but Marie isn't playing nice.

642
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,600
I wanted to trade, but she won't do it!

643
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,699
What's this doll's name?

644
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,200
Beach Bunny Bonnie.

645
00:32:40,202 --> 00:32:42,760
Beach Bunny Bonnie? What kind of a name is that?

646
00:32:43,138 --> 00:32:45,949
I like those names that you gave the dolls the other day.

647
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,829
Uh, "Maye and Wilt" and...

648
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,173
Those aren't doll names, Daddy. Not really.

649
00:32:51,174 --> 00:32:53,099
Well, I know, but I liked them.

650
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,689
Hey, you know what I noticed?

651
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,899
You didn't cut out any dolls out of the paper today.

652
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,359
You told me not to, Daddy!

653
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,299
Yeah, you told her not to, Daddy.

654
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,267
Yes, I know, but I changed my mind.

655
00:33:03,268 --> 00:33:04,308
I'll tell you what, you know.

656
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:06,733
If you want to cut a couple dolls out of the paper tonight

657
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,200
before you went to bed and name them, you know,

658
00:33:08,201 --> 00:33:11,064
that would be okay with me. If you wanted to.

659
00:33:11,065 --> 00:33:12,949
What do you think? Do you want to do it?

660
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,700
Uh-uh. Paper dolls are for babies!

661
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,133
Wait a second. It'll be fun. Come on.

662
00:33:18,134 --> 00:33:19,130
Cut a couple out.

663
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:20,800
You can name them anything you want.

664
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:25,600
Don't you want to make a little, I don't know, Pfizer doll?

665
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,100
How about GE?

666
00:33:29,446 --> 00:33:31,705
Haven't you always wanted a doll named "GE"?

667
00:33:31,706 --> 00:33:33,600
I'm tired, Daddy.

668
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,200
"Apple"?

669
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:37,409
It worked for Gwyneth Paltrow.

670
00:33:57,462 --> 00:33:59,550
ANSWEAR THE PHONE ALLISION

671
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,700
Devalos.

672
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Hello... sir?

673
00:34:06,201 --> 00:34:08,880
I just got off the phone with the Scottsdale Police.

674
00:34:09,008 --> 00:34:10,250
You may have been right.

675
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:13,607
Either Kevin Flynn had a partner or Scottsdals got itself a copycat

676
00:34:13,608 --> 00:34:16,240
who wasted no time in picking up where Flynn left off.

677
00:34:16,241 --> 00:34:17,200
Oh, no...

678
00:34:17,401 --> 00:34:20,206
Yeah, they found the body of a young girl in a Dumpster about an hour ago

679
00:34:20,207 --> 00:34:22,740
pummeled to death just the way Flynn used to do it.

680
00:34:23,422 --> 00:34:26,100
She was wearing a necklace with her name on it, wasn't she?

681
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,500
"Tara."

682
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:30,150
Tara. It was still on her when they found the body.

683
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,800
Did you see anything else?

684
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,900
His face? An address? A license plate?

685
00:34:35,901 --> 00:34:37,700
Yeah. Uh, no.

686
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,200
I'M SO SORRY.

687
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,100
I'm still not sure I understand why

688
00:34:44,102 --> 00:34:46,100
we're driving all the way to Scottsdale.

689
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,403
Any forensic information we want,

690
00:34:48,404 --> 00:34:49,850
they'd be happy to send us.

691
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,400
No, no, I don't think so.

692
00:34:52,604 --> 00:34:53,800
Not what I'm after.

693
00:35:07,365 --> 00:35:09,478
Sir, I know this is a little unusual,

694
00:35:09,479 --> 00:35:12,307
but do you think I could be alone with her for a minute?

695
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,300
I don't know if you're still here.

696
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,880
I don't know if you can hear me...

697
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,950
but I could really use your help.

698
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,400
Did you find what you were looking for?

699
00:35:48,703 --> 00:35:49,650
No.

700
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,100
Honey, just give me...

701
00:35:58,101 --> 00:36:00,100
Yeah, Terry?

702
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,930
No, it's Allison. Go back to sleep.

703
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,400
Go back to sleep, honey.

704
00:36:04,401 --> 00:36:05,600
It's 3:00 in theorning.

705
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,760
Did I just call you Terry?

706
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,200
Yeah, you did.

707
00:36:19,701 --> 00:36:21,700
I-I hope you meant Terry your boss,

708
00:36:21,702 --> 00:36:25,700
not Terry, some young, fetching figment of your imagination.

709
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,450
Young? Fetching?

710
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,440
Why didn't I think about that?

711
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:41,079
No, I was actually dreaming about my, my employer.

712
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,600
My future former employer.

713
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,550
Come on. You don't know that.

714
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:47,990
Yes, I do.

715
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,300
He thinks I'm gonna buthe company.

716
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:54,500
He thinks I've been making a killing in the stock market.

717
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,989
I suppose that...

718
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,800
if you found a way to do it without Marie ever knowing, I mean...

719
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,450
You have nothing to fear.

720
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,400
I think that we may have already

721
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,500
missed the boat on that one.

722
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:15,200
Somebody's knocked the Warren Buffet right out of her.

723
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,760
So, any luck in Scottsdale?

724
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,200
No.

725
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,990
I think he's done it. He's right.

726
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,300
I'm broken.

727
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,850
what's going on in your head?

728
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:40,400
I've finally been thinking about all the ugly things that he's been saying to me.

729
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,400
I guess I can't help but wonder...

730
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,600
where is God in all this?

731
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,990
I mean, I really do believe that I see these things for a reason.

732
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,034
And the reason is to help people

733
00:37:59,035 --> 00:38:01,801
to-to make things right.

734
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,800
But if that's the case, then how could he be allowed to do this?

735
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,660
Maybe it just...

736
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,940
It makes me question everything.

737
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,200
My God!

738
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,200
And I do mean "my God."

739
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,800
You sound incredibly bleak.

740
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,200
Almost suicidal.

741
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,800
Leave my home!

742
00:38:41,802 --> 00:38:43,800
Leave this life.

743
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,948
It's honestly the only way

744
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,100
you'll ever rid yourself of m Allison.

745
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,700
I'm staying

746
00:38:49,701 --> 00:38:52,990
in your home, in your head, in your dreams.

747
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,700
I'm cancer.

748
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,500
I live in you.

749
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,700
So what shall it be?

750
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,540
There's knives in the kitchen.

751
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,300
Perhaps one through the heart?

752
00:39:03,301 --> 00:39:05,800
We could sit in the closed garage with the car running.

753
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,099
I'd let you pick the radio station we listen to

754
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,541
as the carbon monoxide suffocates you to death.

755
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:13,170
Forget that. How about some lye?

756
00:39:13,707 --> 00:39:15,550
Why don't you drink a cup or so,

757
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,807
then stumble into your little girls' room

758
00:39:17,808 --> 00:39:20,000
so they can watch you writhe to death

759
00:39:20,001 --> 00:39:22,030
as it eats through your organs?

760
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,300
Come on, Allison.

761
00:39:25,164 --> 00:39:26,770
It's time for you to move on.

762
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:31,300
Actually... we think 's time for you to move on.

763
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,038
Remember me? I'm the most recent girl

764
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:38,019
that Donald Crommler gassed, bound,

765
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,200
and beat the holy hell out of.

766
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,600
"Donald Crommler." That's his name.

767
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,700
He lives in Scottsdale on Desert Oasis Road.

768
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,800
That's what you came to the morgue to find out this evening, right?

769
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,100
She could have stopped it from happening.

770
00:39:59,506 --> 00:40:01,903
You should have let her stop it from happening.

771
00:40:01,904 --> 00:40:03,300
It was supposed to happen.

772
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:04,630
It was meant to be.

773
00:40:04,632 --> 00:40:07,300
No. The only thing that is meant to be

774
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:09,300
is for you to burn in hell.

775
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,201
And that's where we mean to take you.

776
00:40:11,202 --> 00:40:12,180
"We"?

777
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,990
Who's "we"?

778
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,850
It's your fault we're dead.

779
00:40:24,448 --> 00:40:27,800
You interfered with the dreams of the people who could have saved us.

780
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,900
All because you thought they were evil.

781
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,700
But those people,

782
00:40:32,141 --> 00:40:35,455
the dreamers-- they're not evil.

783
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,400
You are.

784
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,900
What are you doing?

785
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,600
It's time to meet your maker.

786
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,500
It's good you're dressed for the heat.

787
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Donald Crommler.

788
00:41:38,525 --> 00:41:40,100
Desert Oasis Road.

789
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:43,400
Donald Crommler. Desert Oasis Road.

790
00:41:43,403 --> 00:41:45,558
Donald Crommler. Desert Oasis Road.

791
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:46,700
What are you doing?

792
00:41:47,248 --> 00:41:48,400
What's going on?

793
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,300
Is everything all right?

794
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:53,450
Yeah. No. I'm good.

795
00:41:53,451 --> 00:41:54,900
I think I'm great.

796
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,600
I just gotta make a phone call.

797
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,300
Everything is great.

798
