00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,480
****

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,150
The day his parents brought Frisky
home, Jeff couldn't conceal his joy.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,910
Jeff never lost his love for animals.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,620
It's hard to know exactly when his
toothy grin gave way to darker thoughts,

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,610
but in 1991, the police were responding
to a complaint at Jeff's apartment

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,170
when one of them
noticed an unusual smell.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,610
They found a severed
head in his refrigerator.

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,140
There was another one in the freezer, as
well as three more skulls in a filing cabinet,

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,050
and four others spread throughout
the Milwaukee apartment.

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,850
For most of us, that was the first
time we ever heard about Jeffrey Dahmer.

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,760
He was 31 years old.

13
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,330
He'd been killing
people since he was 18.

14
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,650
He was somebody's son,
somebody's brother.

15
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,730
Leslie was the prettiest
girl in Altadena,California.

16
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,310
In fact,she was elected
homecoming princess twice.

17
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,340
After she graduated from high school,
she met her first serious boyfriend.

18
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,510
His name was Charlie.

19
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,780
Leslie Van Houten
joined the Manson family

20
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,590
and was later charged with the
murder of Rosemary and Leno LaBianca.

21
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,060
After stabbing Rosemary 16 times,

22
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:20,610
Leslie changed into clothes from the
LaBiancas' closet and raided their refrigerator.

23
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,370
And when Leslie walked into court
every morning with a smile on her face,

24
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,190
the whole world wondered: how
could someone who looked so sweet,

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,340
who looked like she could be any
one of our daughters, go so wrong?

26
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,240
We want to believe that every child is
born into this world a blank vessel...

27
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,860
{\a6}<i>'BTK***'******</i>

28
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,810
waiting to be filled with
only the best parts of us.

{\a6}<i>Aileen******</i>

30
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,710
And yet,no matter how hard we try,

31
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,250
invariably the day comes when our child
does something that surprises us...

32
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,440
{\a6}<i>Ted******</i>

33
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,400
becomes someone we
don't quite recognize.

34
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,290
- I'm home.
- I'm in the kitchen,Dad.

35
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,700
And we find ourselves
thinking, who is that person?

36
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,370
Okay. Where's your mom and your sisters?

Thanks.

41
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,660
Okay.

42
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,220
Thank you,Mommy.

43
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,120
Someone looks tired.

44
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,320
- I didn't sleep good.
- Well,why is that?

45
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,190
- Why you looking at me?
- You snore.

46
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,250
That's a lie! I've never
once heard me snoring!

47
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,490
You know you snore. We
all know that you snore.

48
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,310
Yeah,well, fine,kick
me out of the house.

49
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,720
Kick me out of the family.

50
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,030
Nobody's kicking you out of anywhere.

51
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,450
I think I need my own room.

52
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,570
Well,I'm sorry,honey. I don't
have another room to give you.

53
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,880
But Ariel has her own room.

54
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,290
Everybody has their own room.

55
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,600
I don't have my own room.

56
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,780
Hey,here's an idea.

57
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,120
Since Ariel doesn't snore
and Marie doesn't snore,

58
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,760
how about they share the bunk
bed and I'll get Ariel's room?

59
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,360
Hey,here's an idea.

60
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,100
How about we go back to that part where
you were talking about leaving the family?

61
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,340
Okay,enough! Everybody,calm
down. Be patient.

62
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,390
Your sister here is gonna go to college
soon and everyone will have their own room.

63
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,950
- Me too?
- Don't push your luck.

64
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,710
Hey,guys,we're leaving in
ten minutes. Did you hear me?

65
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,570
Mm-hmm,yep.

66
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,900
Hey,so,can I,uh,talk to
you guys about something?

67
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,160
All depends. What's the something?

68
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,330
Well,there's this,uh,
thing tomorrow night.

69
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,980
And I know that it's a school night,
but I would,uh, really like to go.

70
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,850
Well,can we know what this thing is?

71
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,830
It's a scavenger hunt. A really cool
scavenger hunt. They do it every year.

72
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,370
It's,uh,for the seniors and the boy who's
putting it together asked Ashley and I if,uh,

73
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,060
we wanted to come, even
though we're not seniors.

74
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,970
Honey,uh,when you find these things, how
does it work? Do you go in cars? Do you drive?

75
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,460
Well,yeah,of course. I
mean,they're all seniors.

76
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,330
Well,um,I think Daddy and
I have to think about this.

77
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,460
And now's not really a good time.

78
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,330
You have to get everybody to school and Detective
Scanlon's coming to get me in 20 minutes.

79
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,330
Can we get back to you on this
later after we think about it?

80
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,210
Yeah,okay. I mean,I just I don't
get what there is to think about.

81
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,740
It's just a scavenger hunt.

82
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,230
I know,we heard you,sweetie. We
just... We just want to think.

83
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,260
Uh,okay,well,you know, I
better get the girls to school.

84
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,080
- Thank you,honey.
- Thank you,sweetie.

85
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,860
So?

86
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,690
So,I think that,uh,we're the
luckiest parents on earth.

87
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,410
- I mean,from the moment you got sick,she's just been...
- I know.

88
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,110
I just think it's going to
be really hard to say no.

89
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,100
Well,we haven't said anything yet.

90
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,220
Allison? Can I steal you for a moment?

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,610
Her name's Elena Agronov.

92
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,680
She's my housekeeper's daughter.

93
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,230
She borrowed her mother's car to
run an errand a couple of nights ago

94
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,180
and hasn't been seen since.

95
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,070
Are the police looking for her?

96
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,430
No,not yet. You know how it works.

97
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,590
You can't file a missing persons report
until she's been gone at least 48 hours.

98
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,340
That's why I thought I'd
print up these flyers.

99
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,610
Get a jump on things.

100
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,720
You know her.

101
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,350
You think she's the kind of girl
who might be in some kind of trouble?

102
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,700
No. No,no,no,not this girl.
She's,uh... she's pretty special.

103
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,800
She practically grew up in
my house. Terrific student.

104
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,930
Putting herself through
college. Accounting major.

105
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,110
No,that,uh, that's what
has us all so concerned.

106
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,870
This is very out of character for her.

107
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,110
Hey,open up!

108
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,580
Ariel,wake up! Wake up. Come on!

109
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,200
What are you looking at? Open the door!

110
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,360
You're dead. I'm telling Mom.

111
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,330
And when she hears that you left your
little sisters out on the street...

112
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,650
You're gonna be quiet
and tell me where to go.

113
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,190
What are you talking about?

114
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,300
We're not going anywhere, not
until Marie gets in the car.

115
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,820
And then we're going home.

116
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,430
And you'll tell me where that is.

117
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,800
I said home. You know where home is.

118
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,570
Anybody home?

119
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,880
In here!

120
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,410
- Only one.
- That's all I ever take.

121
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,510
What are you doing? Looks like homework.

122
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,010
Well,it kind of is. I'm
practicing writing my name.

123
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,720
What a family.

124
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,790
You don't know how to write your name
and Ariel doesn't know where she lives.

125
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,140
- Hello?
- Can I come in?

126
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,600
Honey,are you tired?

127
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,320
She told you about me falling
asleep while I was waiting for her?

128
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,790
She also said that you
drove past the house.

129
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,500
It was stupid. I was
just playing with her.

130
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,040
Okay,if you say so.

131
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:30,290
Um,about tomorrow night, it
just... it makes me uneasy.

132
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,740
Older boys,cars.

133
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,690
I feel like you need some rest.

134
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,210
Are you trying to tell me something?

135
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,400
I just don't think it's smart.

136
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,970
Particularly on a school night.

137
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,520
Okay.

138
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,420
- Okay?
- Yeah,sure,okay.

139
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,660
I'm talking about the scavenger hunt.

140
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,180
Yes,I heard you. You
don't think it's smart.

141
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,150
Mom?

142
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,470
Can I borrow some money?

143
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,890
Well,maybe I can give you a
little advance on your allowance.

144
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,560
How much are you thinking?

145
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,130
Um,maybe about 200.

146
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,570
Dollars? Are you serious?

147
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,920
Honey,we don't have that
kind of money. You know that.

148
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,400
Daddy doesn't even have a regular job.

149
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,650
No,of course,you're right.

150
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,270
I was getting nervous.

151
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,350
I thought maybe you weren't coming. I
thought maybe I came to the wrong place.

152
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,610
- What's this?
- You know what it is.

153
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,970
What's this for?

154
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,190
This is a lot more than
you usually give me.

155
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,460
Is this for going away?

156
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,560
Elena,we need to have a conversation.

157
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,010
Is this why you wanted to meet here?

158
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,480
I can't do this anymore.

159
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,710
I don't want to do this anymore.

160
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,370
But that's not right.
You made me promises.

161
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,500
Yeah,I know, but now I've realized
this just doesn't work for me anymore.

162
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,040
But you said you'd pay my rent.

163
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,270
- I know I did.
- You said you'd pay my tuition.

164
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,140
I know I did,Elena, and I thought
I could do it, but I can't.

165
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,730
I'm not a rich man. I can't keep going to
the bank,the ATM, pulling out money for you.

166
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,480
My wife's starting to
notice. The kids need things.

167
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,530
There's somebody else?

168
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,500
No,there's nobody else.

169
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,500
I just... I need it to end.

170
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:13,130
What about me? What about what I need?

171
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,760
What about you?

172
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:19,880
Well,I mean, you go home to your
wife, your kids,your nice house.

173
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,970
Nothing changes for you. But me...

174
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,500
You'll go back to dancing.

175
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,070
Maybe you'll meet some other
guy. Maybe he'll pay your tuition.

176
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,450
Or maybe he won't. You can't
honestly think that that's my problem?

177
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,150
That's right. You have no problems.

178
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,820
None of this is your doing.

179
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:43,030
You bought something, you
paid for something, but now...

180
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,580
you want out. Fine.

181
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,270
We'll see. Maybe it'll
interest your wife.

182
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,290
Elena,don't you even kid about that.

183
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,090
Look at that.

184
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,770
He's got an Achilles'
heel, and I found it.

185
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,610
You haven't found a thing.

186
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,030
And if you're smart,you'll take that money
I just gave you, you'll invest it wisely,

187
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,460
and you will forget all
about me, all about us.

188
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,800
And what if I'm stupid?

189
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:27,570
What if I take all the
money, invest it wisely,

190
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,080
and still call your wife?

191
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,920
Oh,my God, I was kidding.

192
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,020
- Now we've got a problem now.
- No,there's no problem.

193
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,850
- How can I ever trust you?
- You can.

194
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,600
- You can trust me. I would never say any...
- You don't understand.My family means everything to me.

195
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,240
But you can. You can trust...

196
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,400
Found her right where you said
she'd be-- the Encanto Park overlook.

197
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,500
Somebody shot her twice, then
left her there for the coyotes.

198
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,060
Her mother's car was
parked maybe 20 yards away.

199
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:03,400
So if I put you in front of some mug books, do
you think you'd recognize the man who did this?

200
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,420
I can try.

201
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,830
I kind of doubt he's gonna be in there.

202
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,640
He didn't really strike
me as a career criminal.

203
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:13,620
More like a guy who's having a midlife
crisis who'd gotten in too deep.

204
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,620
Well,do me a favor. Take a look anyway.

205
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:21,130
If you come up empty,we'll run the composite
software, see if we can generate a sketch.

206
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,640
In the meantime,I have to
get a hold of Elena's mom.

207
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,360
Tell her that her daughter's dead.

208
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,420
What are you doing? That's
Mom and Dad's private stuff.

209
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,810
You're not supposed to be in there.

210
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,630
I was just,uh,looking for my blouse.

211
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:18,330
It's not in my closet, and I thought that
maybe Mom had put it in-in here by mistake.

212
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,680
In Dad's money drawer?

213
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,700
Fine,but you're still not
supposed to be in there.

214
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,020
And what are you going to do about it?

215
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:38,590
I don't know. I haven't
made up my mind yet.

216
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:46,390
- What you eating?
- Nothing.

217
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,690
You sure?

218
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,800
'Cause I think you are.

219
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:59,170
And I think that I heard Mom say that she
doesn't want you snacking after school.

220
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:07,270
So,I guess I didn't see you do anything
if you didn't see me do anything.

221
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,530
Yes,but,see,I didn't do anything.

222
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,600
And neither did I.

223
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,920
Mommy?

224
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,670
Hey,Pumpkin. What are you doing up?

225
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,310
I can't find Ariel.

226
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:35,220
Bridgette was snoring again, so I went in
to go sleep with Ariel, but she's not there.

227
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,120
Did you really think you were
going to get away with it?

228
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,560
She's here. She's home. She looks fine.

229
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,960
- I am fine.
- She is fine.

230
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,960
I'll see you in a minute.

231
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,820
Hey,your dad has been driving
all around town looking for you.

232
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,360
You went to that scavenger
hunt thing,didn't you?

233
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,400
That's it? That's all I get,a shrug?

234
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,720
And what do you want me to say?

235
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,770
You know everything.
So,can I just go to bed?

236
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,400
You've been smoking,
haven't you? I mean...

237
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,940
Smell this. You reek. And what is this?

238
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:28,400
It's from the scavenger thing.
It's my team,the She Devils.

239
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,940
Okay,give me my keys right now.

240
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,390
You will get these back in the morning.

241
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,630
I will get them back from you in the afternoon
when you bring the girls home from school.

242
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,210
Forget this weekend. Forget
your allowance. You are grounded.

243
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,350
And when your dad gets home,
he's gonna want to speak to you.

244
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,470
Okay.

245
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,070
So?

246
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,450
- So?
- So,what did she say?

247
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,310
Not a lot. And you're right.
She smells like an ashtray.

248
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,870
How can you be so calm?

249
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,550
I'm not calm. I'm tired.

250
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,950
And I guess I'm relieved.

251
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,800
- You're relieved?
- No. Look,okay,fine.

252
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,270
Relieved is the wrong
word. I guess I'm just...

253
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,970
whatever word you want to use
that she's home, and she's alive.

254
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,770
She snuck out of our house.
She was smoking cigarettes.

255
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,110
Yeah,yeah. I know.

256
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,880
That's awful, but it's not as awful as a
lot of other things that I can think of.

257
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,230
Well,Ariel's certainly
Daddy's little girl.

258
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,450
What does that mean?

259
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,350
It means how can you not be mad at her?

260
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,030
I didn't say that I wasn't mad.

261
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,430
I didn't say I wasn't disappointed.

262
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,690
But she's almost 17. She's gonna
push the boundaries a little bit.

263
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,050
And that's what she's supposed to do.

264
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,610
Oh,she's just doing what
she's supposed to do?

265
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,750
No. You know what I mean.

266
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,650
When she pushes, it's
our job to push back.

267
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,720
Hard. And we did. You
did. She's grounded.

268
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,850
Maybe that will make her think twice
before pulling a stunt like this again.

269
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:02,090
But if it doesn't,all right, fine,we'll
push back harder. All right? Okay?

270
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,200
Did I say the right thing
yet? Can we go to sleep yet?

271
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,760
You know what? Keep it up,buddy.

272
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,630
I'll ground you,too.

273
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,400
I need to see some ID, and it'd
better be damned impressive.

274
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,050
I don't have any.

275
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,170
But that's okay. I won't be here long.

276
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,920
Oh,you got that right 'cause
we don't serve kids in here.

277
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,380
Don't worry about it.
I'm not here to drink.

278
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,390
I'm here to see you,Trent.

279
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,380
I'm here to make a purchase.

280
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,630
I don't know what you're talking about.

281
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,250
We sell hugs. We don't sell drugs.

282
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,300
And what we do sell, we don't sell to
minors, so you might want to hit the road.

283
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,410
I'm not looking for something to shoot.

284
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,140
I'm looking for something to shoot with.

285
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,890
It's got some miles on it,
but it still shoots just fine.

286
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,120
200.

287
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,480
I got $153.

288
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,890
Good news. We're running a special.

289
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:33,930
So,uh, what's someone like
you need a gun for anyway?

290
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,590
What do people usually need guns for?

291
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,780
Well,sometimes it's 'cause
they got a score to make.

292
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,590
Sometimes it's 'cause
they got a score to settle.

293
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,230
You don't look bad enough
to be making a score.

294
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:56,060
You don't look old enough
to have any scores to settle.

295
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,000
Well,I'm older than I look.

296
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,460
Thanks for your help... Trent.

297
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,540
It's good to see you again.

298
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,720
Little girl?

299
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,080
I don't think I caught your name.

300
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,460
Sure you did. It's Elena.

301
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:40,320
Mom? What's going on?

302
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,080
Did I wake you?

303
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,450
I was trying not to make any noise.
I was just looking for something.

304
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,390
Okay,what are you talking
about? What are you looking for?

305
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,130
I thought he put it in
here but no,just cigarettes.

306
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,380
Okay,what are you looking for?

307
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,210
- The gun.
- What gun?

308
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,610
I think we both know what
gun I'm talking about.

309
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,710
The one that you bought last night
when you snuck out of the house

310
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,340
and I thought you were
at that scavenger hunt.

311
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,640
- Okay,Mom...
- Stop it! Don't call me that. I'm not your mom.

312
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,020
I know who you are,Elena.

313
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,270
I know what you're trying to do and
I'm not gonna let you get away with it.

314
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,910
I'm not gonna let my daughter
get the blame for something

315
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,480
that she doesn't even
know is happening to her.

316
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,780
Where is the gun?

317
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,110
Mom,you're crazy.

318
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,140
- Where is that gun?
- Okay,you know what? You are crazy!

319
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,870
Where is the gun?

320
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,180
- Get off of me!
- I want that gun and I want my daughter back!

321
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,810
Help! Get her off me!

322
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,330
What the hell? What are you
doing? The hell's going on in here?

323
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,670
- She's crazy! She's not Ariel!
- She is not our daughter,Joe!

324
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,350
She snuck out of the house last night.

325
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,890
She wasn't on a scavenger
hunt. She bought a gun!

326
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,830
- A gun?
- I don't know anything about a gun!

327
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,080
She's hidden a gun somewhere.
She's planning on killing a man.

328
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,060
- Ariel?
- She's not Ariel!

329
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,120
Dad,please!

330
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,570
Okay,well,clearly you've been all through
this room and there's nothing here.

331
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,800
So,can we just,can we let everybody just get
up and get dressed and get ready for school?

332
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:12,700
She's not driving my
other daughters to school.

333
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,720
I am!

334
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,410
I'm driving everyone to school.

335
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,310
Can I talk to you in our bedroom?

336
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,960
Ask her her birthday.

337
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,670
No,you know what, better yet, ask her the name of
her best friend who moved to Texas when she was five.

338
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,950
I'm sorry but I'm just,
I'm-I'm not doing that.

339
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,360
- Why not?
- 'Cause I just am not.

340
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:35,310
It's my daughter. I'm
not quizzing my daughter.

341
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,910
No,you're not listening.

342
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,460
That's not your daughter, our
daughter. That's someone else.

343
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:43,800
That's someone with a deadly agenda
who has taken over our daughter's body.

344
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,760
I'm sorry,but that is
just not what I see.

345
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,930
It just is not. What I
see is our little girl,

346
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,360
a girl that I've known since the moment
that she was born crying hysterically

347
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,540
because her mom is acting
like she's not there.

348
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,940
- She's not.
- Where are you going?

349
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,810
Stay away from her! Just
let her get ready for school.

350
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,780
Let me take care of this for you.

351
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:17,350
Just tell me his name. Then
you don't have to do anything.

352
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,910
If you give me his name, the chances are
good we'll be able to put him away for life.

353
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:25,390
Then you can go wherever it is you need
to go and I can have my daughter back.

354
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,720
I don't know what you're taking about.

355
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,110
All right,I'm going to
run the girls to school.

356
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,030
That is not our little girl.

357
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,970
Did you borrow some money from me?

358
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,330
What are you talking about?

359
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:56,040
I'm missing,like,$150 from my drawer.

360
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,280
Hey,so,listen, uh,we're making
plans for your birthday next month,

361
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:12,190
but the 17th falls on a,uh,
on a Wednesday this year.

362
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,300
Do you want to do something that night
or you want to wait for the weekend?

363
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:19,290
Dad,my birthday's not until spring.

364
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,870
Right. Well,you wait.

365
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,600
You have three kids of your own
with three different birthdays

366
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,910
and see if you don't
start mixing and matching.

367
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,350
Whatever you say.

368
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,590
And one other thing.

369
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,260
You didn't happen to go
into my dresser,did you?

370
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,530
Last day or two?

371
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,190
Um,actually,I did.

372
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,210
I was looking for a
blouse. A T-shirt,really.

373
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:56,080
And I thought that maybe Mommy had
gotten mixed up and put it in your room.

374
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,200
Bye.

375
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,130
Can I help you? I'm the manager.

376
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,570
My name is Allison Dubois.

377
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:29,930
I'm with the District Attorney's office
and I'm here investigating a report that

378
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:33,070
an underage girl was in your
establishment two nights ago,

379
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,870
which is a clear violation of
your adult entertainment license.

380
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,950
We also have reason to believe that
this girl purchased an illegal firearm

381
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,990
while she was in your establishment.

382
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,390
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

383
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,770
I'm thinking you might want
to speak to my attorney.

384
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,520
Why don't you just take a look at this
girl and see if this jogs your memory?

385
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,970
Wait a minute. You're in the
picture too. What,are you her mother?

386
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,500
I thought you said
you were with the D.A.

387
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,410
What,is this some kind of joke?

388
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,590
No,this is no joke. There's
nothing funny about this.

389
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,140
Yes,I'm her mother and I'm with
the District Attorney's office.

390
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,170
You think you're in trouble now?

391
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,570
If that girl hurts anyone with
that gun, you're an accessory.

392
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:21,120
I just wanted to make sure that
this place existed. That you existed.

393
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,370
Excuse me? Can I help you?

394
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,540
Why are you on my lawn
staring into my house?

395
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,690
I'm so sorry. My name's Allison Dubois.

396
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,620
Uh,my daughter Ariel's
inside your house.

397
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,480
Mom? What's going on?
What are you doing here?

398
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,480
Did you follow me here?

399
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,320
Oh,my God,I cannot believe
that you followed me here.

400
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,260
I'm so sorry.My daughter,Ariel,

401
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:38,710
was grounded and she was supposed
to come straight home from school.

402
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,060
Okay,you know what? Mom,stop
it,okay? This is Devin.

403
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,110
Okay,she's helping me with chemistry.

404
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,680
We have a chemistry test in
three days and we were studying.

405
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:54,230
And I am so sorry, but I didn't realize
that studying was a violation of my sentence.

406
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,150
I'm sorry,Devin.

407
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,110
I'm sorry,but she was
supposed to come straight home.

408
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:04,980
She really hasn't been herself lately and her father
and I just felt like we really needed to buckle down.

409
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,450
So,come on. Get your
things. We're gonna go.

410
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,360
Well,I think she's clear now
on what it means to be grounded.

411
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,430
I'm gonna go talk to her.

412
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,840
Uh,let's not and say we did.

413
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,060
Who are you protecting here?

414
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,950
The girl that's in that
room is not our daughter.

415
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,760
Okay,whatever you say,Allison.

416
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,470
Are you patronizing me?

417
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,170
No,I'm not patronizing
you. I'm pleading with you.

418
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,080
Knock it off!

419
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:41,260
Whoever you think she is, she
lives in our house under our roof

420
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,880
and she looks like our daughter to me.

421
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,630
And the fact remains, the only
crime that she has committed today

422
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,070
is going out to some girl's
house to study chemistry.

423
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,580
So,what do you say? As a favor
to me, can we just knock it off?

424
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,440
Leave it. Give it a rest.

425
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,910
Kevin? Are you still outside?

426
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,540
Be right in.

427
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,710
Sorry. I was tidying up the yard.

428
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,740
Kevin,aren't you forgetting something?

429
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,870
Bless us,oh,Lord, for these thy
gifts which we are about to receive

430
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,470
from thy bounty through
Christ our Lord. Amen.

431
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,980
I know who shot you. And I can prove it.

432
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,520
I know where the gun is,
the one he used to do it.

433
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,710
I can bring him to justice. I can.

434
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,450
And that means you don't
have to kill anybody.

435
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,010
Just tell me where
you're hiding the gun.

436
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:35,610
The one you're planning
on doing it with.

437
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:41,590
Please give me Ariel back.

438
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:51,680
The day before yesterday, while
you thought I was at school...

439
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,450
I went to see my mother.

440
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:07,820
I stood across the street
from our apartment...

441
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:14,720
and I watched as she went to church

442
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,750
and lit a candle...for me.

443
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:28,810
I didn't realize that a single
human could hold so many tears.

444
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,300
I'm dead,Allison.

445
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:40,190
And do you know why?

446
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:47,970
Because a man who was
willing to say anything,

447
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,480
do anything, spend
anything to have me...

448
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,820
woke up one day...

449
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,530
and realized that he was tired of me.

450
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:12,000
I am not a stupid girl,Allison.

451
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:16,810
I know the meaning of justice.

452
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,290
And soon...

453
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,340
so will that man.

454
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,510
- Hey,Dev?
- Yeah?

455
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,950
Can I get a ride home from school today?

456
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,590
I don't have my car today,
but we'll give you a ride home,

457
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,690
long as you don't mind
being seen with my dorky dad.

458
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,810
Ariel Dubois? Hey,Ariel.

459
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,100
Are you talking to me?

460
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,640
I'm Detective Lee Scanlon. I work
with your mother. You know me.

461
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:19,810
I'm gonna need you to come with me. The district
attorney has a few questions he'd like to ask you.

462
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,350
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Yeah.

463
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:35,710
I mean, I don't get it. I've
been here for over an hour.

464
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,810
I mean,I know I'm only 16,
but don't I have rights?

465
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,630
Of course you have rights.

466
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,770
Okay,well,aren't I supposed
to know why I'm being held?

467
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,270
Aren't I entitled to a lawyer?

468
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,920
Don't I get a phone call or something?

469
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:53,740
Absolutely. You're entitled to all those things
if you were being held, but you are not being held.

470
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,660
I'm sorry if that
wasn't made clear to you.

471
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:00,460
You're here because you're a
friend, because I want to help you.

472
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:05,950
But if you don't want my help, you
are free to leave at any time you like.

473
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,610
Okay,well...

474
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,690
Of course if you do leave,
I will have you arrested.

475
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,880
Probably start with a
concealed weapons charge.

476
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,930
That gun that was found in your purse when
you went through the metal detector outside.

477
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,160
Pretty
open-and-shut case.

478
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,510
I never saw that gun before.

479
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:24,890
Okay,the man behind me in line
must have slipped it into my bag.

480
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:30,810
Sounds plausible, but that's not
the gun I want to discuss with you.

481
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,380
- What's that?
- This? This is a murder weapon.

482
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,560
It was used to kill a girl...

483
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,180
a woman named Elena
Agronov. Ever heard of her?

484
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,050
No.

485
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,370
Well,that's curious because we
received an anonymous tip this morning.

486
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,850
The caller told us exactly
where to find this gun.

487
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,470
Told us to look in your
bedroom under your mattress.

488
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:11,710
We found it about two hours ago right
where the caller said it would be.

489
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:15,260
What? How is that even possible?

490
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,760
There's something else you need to know.

491
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:21,570
When we were in your room, we
took some hair from your hairbrush.

492
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,880
We have forensics comparing it
to the DNA on some blonde hairs

493
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,510
that were recently discovered
on Ms.Agronov's body.

494
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:30,330
What? What are you talking about?

495
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:34,430
How could my hair end up
on some stranger's body?

496
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:40,300
If the DNA is a match-- and I'm
beginning to suspect that it might be--

497
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:43,640
we'll have you connected to the scene of
the crime, as well as the murder weapon,

498
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:47,160
and I will be forced to charge
you with first degree murder.

499
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,230
I wanted to speak to you
before I'm compelled to do that.

500
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,700
I want to make you a proposition.

501
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,440
Confess to the murder of Elena Agronov,

502
00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:00,200
and I promise you that you will
spend no more than 25 years in prison.

503
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:06,040
But you put this office, you put your
mother, through the pain of prosecuting you,

504
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:10,490
and I guarantee you, you will spend
the rest of your life behind bars.

505
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,260
- This is my mother.
- Excuse me?

506
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,440
This is my mother.

507
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:21,650
My mother did this. Okay?

508
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:25,240
She planted that gun.
She planted the hair.

509
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:28,460
Ariel,why would your mother do
this? Why would any mother do that?

510
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:35,610
Okay,look,I don't know what she has told you,
but I have never heard of this dead woman.

511
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,190
I have never seen that gun
before. Any gun,for that matter.

512
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,930
So,please,can you please call my
father, and he can clear all of this up?

513
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,430
I'm happy to call whomever you like,

514
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:48,220
but you need to know that there was no one
more distraught when we showed up at your door

515
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,620
- with a search warrant than your mother.
- Right.

516
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:54,330
I am sure that she was beside herself.

517
00:37:55,650 --> 00:38:00,320
Okay,look,I am trying to tell you
that she has been acting crazy lately.

518
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:07,940
Devalos. I see. Thank you.

519
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:13,600
Forensics. Preliminary DNA
report is back. It's a match.

520
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,730
I'm sorry that you
don't want my help,Ariel.

521
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,240
I'll get a hold of your folks,
let them know what's going on,

522
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:31,300
tell them to start
looking for an attorney.

523
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:34,110
I'll be back shortly
with an arrest warrant.

524
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,590
We'll read you your rights
and take you to processing.

525
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,280
No,no,no,no,no,no. Wait. You have to
believe me. I haven't killed anybody!

526
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:48,680
Get off of me! Get off me. Get off me!

527
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,230
So what happens now?

528
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:26,300
I don't know. I'm sorry,Elena.
I couldn't let you kill a man.

529
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:29,980
So you framed me for my own murder?

530
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,300
What choice did you give me?

531
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,460
I couldn't let you turn
my child into a killer.

532
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:42,490
Your child is going to prison
for the rest of her life.

533
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,270
No,she's not. No. You are.

534
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:51,280
What are we doing here,Allison?

535
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,550
Playing a game of chicken?

536
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:59,260
Because,obviously, I'm
not going to prison.

537
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,410
Obviously,if you force me to,
I will give up your daughter,

538
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:12,010
but I promise you that I will do
it at the last possible second.

539
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,270
I will wait until I'm behind bars,

540
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,030
and I'll make notes

541
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:24,120
so that she understands
exactly how it happened.

542
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,430
And you...

543
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:32,300
you will spend years trying to get her
out, as she suffers through that hell,

544
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:36,870
knowing that it was
you who put her there.

545
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,000
Allison,I need you to step outside.

546
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,740
We have an arrest
warrant for your daughter.

547
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,560
Oh,wait. One moment,please.

548
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:52,330
I'm doing this for you,too,Elena.

549
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:58,010
So you can go wherever it is you need
to go without any blood on your hands.

550
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:04,300
And for your mother, so she can go into
that church, and she can light those candles,

551
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:07,150
and they can mean something.

552
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:10,110
What are you doing?

553
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,210
I'm not going... anywhere.

554
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,370
Come in.

555
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,710
Ariel Dubois, you're under arrest.

556
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,080
You have the right to remain silent.

557
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,950
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

558
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,100
You have the right to an attorney
present during questioning.

559
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,970
If you can't afford one, one
will be appointed for you.

560
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,710
- Do you understand these rights?
- Sure.

561
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:02,180
Please.

562
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,940
- Elena?
- Ariel?

563
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,370
- Ariel?
- Mom?

564
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:39,950
- Ariel?
- What's going on? How did I get here?

565
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:58,650
Did it work? Looks like it worked.

566
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:02,350
Worked perfectly. We
have our little girl home.

567
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,540
Mom,I think I know that man.

568
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:12,030
I think he's the,uh,dad of
one of the girls at school.

569
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,870
Did he do something wrong?

570
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:16,630
He did,but that doesn't concern us.

571
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:20,320
Absolutely. No, that
does not concern us.

572
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:27,140
