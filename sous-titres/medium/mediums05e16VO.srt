00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,800
I'm a banana. I'm in the fruit group.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,990
To maintain a healthy and balanced diet,

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:19,370
you should have two, three,
or four servings of me per day.

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,850
I'm a chicken drumstick.

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,450
I'm from the Meat and Poultry group.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,670
To maintain a healthy and balanced diet,

9
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,400
you should have two or three
servings of me each and every day.

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,430
I'm a pea pod. I'm...

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,970
You're a vegetable.

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,370
You're a vegetable!

13
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,890
I'm a veg... I'm in the...

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,560
Vegetable...

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,280
Three to five servings per day.

16
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,300
What?

17
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,680
Three to five servings per day.

18
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,200
Mommy, Mommy, wake up.

19
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,040
Oh, Marie, honey, you okay?

20
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,470
Did you have another
bad dream about the play?

21
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,630
Can I sleep with you?

22
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,190
Of course you can, sweetie.

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,220
Just as long as you
say your lines right.

24
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,660
Come on, honey. Let's hear them.

25
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,050
Marie, honey? We need
you to say those lines.

26
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,890
Come on, honey. We're serious.

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,670
If you don't say those lines right,

28
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,540
you're just going to have to stand by the
side of the bed for the rest of your life.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,520
I'm a pea pod. I'm a part
of the vegetable group.

33
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,210
When I was in kindergarten,
I was the tomato.

34
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,340
And Scottie Collins, he was the peanut.

35
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,310
And he got so scared, he
peed right there on the stage.

36
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,300
And from that day on, we called
him "pee-nut." And we still do.

37
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,580
Okay, Bridgette, that is enough.

38
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,650
- Mom?
- You okay?

39
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,230
- Hey, you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

40
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,370
- Let me give you a hand.
- No, no, I'm okay. Just let me sit.

41
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,920
Let me just sit down for a second.

42
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,180
Whoo, I was feeling a little bit faint.

43
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,530
For a second there.

44
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,300
Honey, honey, I'm okay. Just
probably drank too much coffee.

45
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,450
Are you sure? You want
me to call the doctor?

46
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,040
- No.
- Maybe we should run you by the emergency room.

47
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,790
No, I'm okay.

48
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,170
Okay, well, let me take
the girls to school.

49
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,530
That way you only have to worry
about getting yourself to work.

50
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,940
A-ha, my master plan worked.

51
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,250
I'll be fine, honey, but
that would be really nice.

52
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,860
Allison, I see you found me.

53
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,210
Went to the office. They told me you
wanted me out here. What's going on?

54
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,060
City Controller called me a
little after 8:00 this morning.

55
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:27,150
Department of Public Works is laying
some new underground power lines out here

56
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,980
and one of their crews came
across... Watch your step.

57
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,250
One of their crews came across
a body in a shallow grave.

58
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,900
Looks like the fellow was
shot sometime last night.

59
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:36,880
What are you doing out here?

60
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,000
I mean, until somebody's charged with the
murder, isn't this really a police matter?

61
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,210
Well, since the dead man met with foul play,
the whole area is now an active crime scene,

62
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,950
and that means that work has to stop until
investigation of the death is completed.

63
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,700
And that means that the city's
paying for all these contractors,

64
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,640
workers to stand around doing nothing.

65
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,200
So, I was asked to help expedite things.

66
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,270
Naturally, he has no ID.

67
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,870
I'm guessing that whoever
killed him saw to that.

68
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,470
We're running his prints and his
DNA, but that's gonna take a while.

69
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,100
Also, we found some hairs on
his body that don't belong to him

70
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,050
and that might point
to whoever did this,

71
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:20,710
but I was hoping that you would just take a
look at him and have one of your eureka moments.

72
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,210
Sorry. No eureka. No nothing.

73
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,240
Well, maybe this will help.
Ankle holster, but no gun.

74
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,920
- Was he on the force? -
Nope. Not police-issued.

75
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,730
All right, well, you'll let me know if
any bells go off in your head, won't you?

76
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,950
Of course, you'll be
the first person I call.

77
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,370
Allison! Hey, can you hear me?

78
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,110
Someone call an ambulance. Get a doctor!

79
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,660
Allison! Allison! Allison!

80
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,920
Allison! Allison! Allison!

81
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,040
Where is she?

82
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,900
They took her in the back.

83
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,860
Excuse me. Can I help you?

84
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,750
My name is Dubois.
D-U-B-O-I-S.

85
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,180
My wife, Allison, was just brought
in here. I just wanted to see her.

86
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,530
Uh, maybe I could talk
to somebody about her.

87
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,050
The doctors are with your
wife right now, Mr. Dubois.

88
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,400
Somebody will come out and talk
to you just as soon as they can.

89
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,120
Yeah, I just want to
know what was going on.

90
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,980
You have to wait for the doctor
to come out and talk to you.

91
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,930
I'm sorry. That's all I can tell you.

92
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,650
- Okay, thank you.
- Come sit down, Joe.

93
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,190
Quiet. It's all right.
I live around here.

94
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,830
Mr. Dubois?

95
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,540
Yeah, hi.

96
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,140
Mr. Dubois, I'm Dr. Richards.

97
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,690
Hello. My... my wife? Can I see her?

98
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,590
I don't know what you know. I
don't know what you've heard.

99
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,350
Your wife arrived unconscious.

100
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,650
Unfortunately, she's still unconscious,
and frankly, we don't know why.

101
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,350
What do you mean you don't know why?

102
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,600
Well, there's no evidence
of physical trauma.

103
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,330
A bruise to the head or
any other kind of injury.

104
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,460
The CAT scan is negative, uh, no
evidence of scarring on the brain.

105
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,710
So, for the moment
we're a bit at a loss.

106
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,780
She's just not present.

107
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,250
I'm sorry. You have to give me
a better explanation than that.

108
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,120
I don't have a better
explanation than that.

109
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,150
We've called several neurospecialists.

110
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,020
Your wife will be examined by one of them
just as soon as we can get someone here.

111
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:25,510
Beyond that, I could tell you that when
something like this has happened in the past,

112
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,000
40 to 50% of the time, the patient
just comes out of it spontaneously.

113
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,950
Okay, what about the other,
uh, 50 or 60% of the time?

114
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,920
You just sit tight. Leave
your numbers at the desk.

115
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,580
And as soon as your wife can have
visitors, I'll make sure we find you.

116
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,010
Okay, well, thank
you, thank you, Doctor.

117
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,330
You all right?

118
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,310
Yeah, I gotta go pick
the girls up from school.

119
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,260
I can send a city car
for them if you'd like.

120
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,730
No, it's okay. Thank you, though.

121
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,580
Um, somebody's gotta, you know,
explain to them what's going on.

122
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,740
Um, excuse me. I have
to give them my numbers.

123
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,860
I don't understand.
She got sick at work?

124
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,920
I think that maybe she was starting to get sick
this morning when she fell down in the kitchen.

125
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,150
But, you know, in any event, she's in
the hospital right now and you know,

126
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,240
they're taking really great care of her.

127
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,940
Can we visit her?

128
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,760
Not today, sweetie. Not
right now, but soon maybe.

129
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,720
Well, can we talk to her on the phone?

130
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,900
Like I said, not today. Maybe tomorrow.

131
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:34,410
What's she sick with? I mean, you've gotta
be awfully sick to go to the hospital.

132
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,690
Not necessarily.

133
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,170
Well... who's that, Daddy?

134
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,850
Great. This is all I need.

135
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,420
All right, you kids wait here.
Ariel, lock the door after I get out.

136
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,880
Hey, no, no, no. You can't stand
here, man. This is private property.

137
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,780
Come on. Are you lost?

138
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,980
You need me to call someone for you?

139
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,080
Don't be frightened... Joe.

140
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,750
Excuse me? What did you call me?

141
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,510
Hey, listen to me. I got
kids in that car. My kids.

142
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,460
This is my house; you're preventing
me from getting my kids in my house.

143
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,890
What are you doing?
Don't wave to my children.

144
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,530
Come on, I'm gonna count to three.

145
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,020
And if you're not off this lawn by the
time I'm done, I'm calling the police, okay?

146
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,830
- Not necessary.
- One... two...

147
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,810
- Going, Joe.
- Come on. Come on.

148
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,410
Thank you. Three.

149
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,570
I don't know what to tell you, Mom.

150
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,770
By the time you get out here and get on
a plane, you know, she might just be fine.

151
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,760
I think I just want to wait
and hear from the doctors.

152
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,250
Daddy, he's back!

153
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,260
Mom, let me call you back.

154
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,110
What's going on?

155
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,470
What are you doing here in the
dark staring out the window?

156
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,110
The weird guy in the nightgown?

157
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,430
He's standing on the
sidewalk, staring at our house.

158
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,830
I'm sorry. That's just creepy.

159
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,740
Go to your room and do your homework.

160
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,080
- Well, what are you going to do?
- Go on.

161
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,280
- Call the police?
- I don't know. Go on. Maybe.

162
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,910
Oh, God.

163
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,150
Oh, Joe, I'm so... I'm so
glad you finally came back out.

164
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,200
Right, that's... that's
really nice of you.

165
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,730
Listen, man, you got to...

166
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,210
I don't know who you are or how
you know my name, but, uh, look,

167
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,570
we're going through some
stuff in our house, okay,

168
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,650
- some difficult, painful stuff.
- I kn... I know all about it.

169
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,600
And frankly, you're
upsetting my children.

170
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,970
Oh, please, please, you've got to tell
them everything's going to be okay.

171
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,450
Okay, you're upsetting me, too, okay?

172
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,370
So, um, this is the last time.

173
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,800
Is there somebody that
I can call for you?

174
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,410
Do you have somebody
who can pick you up?

175
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,600
Because, look, if you don't, I-I'm,
I'm going to have to call the police.

176
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,710
No? All right, well, I
got to call the police.

177
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,660
555-0126.

178
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,070
Ask for my husband. He'll... he'll come.

179
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,060
He'll, he'll, he'll pick me
up. He'll figure this out.

180
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,470
That's my number.

181
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,930
That's because I'm your wife.

182
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,380
Dad? It's the hospital. It's about Mom.

183
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,370
You stay here.

184
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,980
Where else would I go?
This is where I live.

185
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,600
I'm not so sure about that.

186
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,240
- Hi, this is Joe Dubois.
- Can you please hold?

187
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,030
Yeah, I'll hold.

188
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,870
Dad, why are you talking to that
strange man out there? He scares me.

189
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,930
- Wait, wait, wait a second.
- I'm connecting you now.

190
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,900
- Doctor?
- Mr. Dubois?

191
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,750
This is Joe Dubois. H-How is she?

192
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,900
I don't really have
anything new to report.

193
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,890
Still waiting to hear what
our tests today tell us.

194
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,640
Okay. But she's comfortable, right?

195
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,430
Very comfortable.

196
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,610
- And sh-she's there,
right? - Excuse me?

197
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,890
I mean, physically,
you know she's there.

198
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,510
I'm looking right at
her; I'm in her room.

199
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,960
Okay, good, good.

200
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:25,120
So if you'd still like to see her, today makes
no sense, but I'm sure you could come by tomorrow.

201
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:29,270
Okay, excellent. Well, th-that's
what I'll do, then. Thank you, Doctor.

202
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,790
So?

203
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,020
So yeah, uh... it's like I said.

204
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,050
She's comfortable. Everything's good.

205
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,630
Um, maybe she'll even
come home tomorrow.

206
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,540
- Did you speak to her?
- How do you mean?

207
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,150
Did you speak to her? Did
she want to speak to us?

208
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,180
No, I guess they gave her
something. She was asleep.

209
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,380
Well, do you want me to go get Bridgette
and Marie so that you can tell them?

210
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,490
'Cause I know that they're really concerned
and that would make them feel better.

211
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:03,510
Yeah, okay. Uh, let me just
talk to this guy out front first.

212
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,510
Okay, what did you mean by that?

213
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,920
What did I mean by what?

214
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,250
That thing you said before--
that you're my, uh...

215
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,400
- Your wife.
- Yeah.

216
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,390
That's because I am.

217
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,390
I'm Allison, Joe.

218
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,790
How dare you?

219
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,760
You are not my wife. How c...

220
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,790
My wife is in a... in
a coma in the hospital.

221
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,740
She's fighting for her life.

222
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,830
Well, no, not really.

223
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:48,180
I mean, my body is there, yes,
but y-you got to believe me.

224
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:53,770
- Joe, this is... this is me.
- Come here. Let me see this.

225
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,350
Okay, you are Todd Emory.

226
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:04,300
All right, here, Todd Emory, and you
are obviously, clearly, deeply disturbed.

227
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,970
I am disturbed...

228
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,920
but not how you think.

229
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,280
I am disturbed because every time
I pass a mirror or a store window,

230
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:17,580
- I see a reflection, but it isn't me.
- Oh, my God.

231
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:22,980
I am disturbed because I have walked
for miles and miles to get here

232
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,510
and you threw me off my own front lawn
this morning in front of my children,

233
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:31,430
and I am disturbed because the person
I am counting on to get me through this

234
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,180
is acting like he is disgusted by me.

235
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,860
I don't know who this Todd Emory is.

236
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,960
I don't know why he's on my wrist,
but I do know that's my home;

237
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,480
you're my husband;
those are my children.

238
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,740
I'm calling the police.

239
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:50,160
Good, call the police. Better yet,
call Scanlon. Better yet, call Devalos.

240
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,610
Get the...

241
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,150
No, no, no, come on.

242
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,190
Stop, stop, stop, please. I...

243
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,160
Come on, man. Hey, hey,
hey, sir, sir, please.

244
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,690
Sir, come on, Todd, Todd.

245
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,930
Please. I-I...

246
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,510
Al.

247
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,110
Oh, my Godthey're coming up t walk toge.

248
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,160
I'm locking the door.

249
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,350
- *******
- No!

250
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,920
rls, uh,s is.

251
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:03,680
Emory. Todd Emory. I'm...

252
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,190
it's very nice to meet the three of you.

253
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,570
I hope I not interrupting ur homework.

254
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,650
He's, uh.

255
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,980
he's sleeping here tonight.

256
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,780
In our house? In this house?

257
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:27,120
Well, he...he needs a place to stay,

258
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:32,440
d I don'want to go into all
the reasons why, but, uh...

259
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,570
I think it's the right
thing to do for tonight.

260
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,450
I can use the couch.

261
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,190
If there is one i-in, in
a room in that direction.

262
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,770
Are you serious?

263
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,310
That's crazy. This is
crazy. You're crazy.

264
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,860
You threw this man off
our lawn this afternoon.

265
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,530
Hey, hey, don't talk to
your father like that.

266
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,710
Don't talk to me like that.

267
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,320
Hold on, hold on a second, young lady.

268
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,970
You know, if Mom was here,
she would never allow this.

269
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:12,280
Yes, well, Mom is not here. I
am, and you need to trust me.

270
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,920
- Now, hopefully tomorrow, Mister...
- Emory.

271
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:20,300
Yes, Mr. Emory will go back where
he belongs and Mom will be back here

272
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,080
where she belongs and all
will be right with the world.

273
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:29,470
- Tomorrow.
- Right, if we live till then.

274
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,260
Well, I'm locking my door,
and I am locking their door,

275
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:38,500
and if you so much as walk
down this hall past our rooms...

276
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,740
He is not walking anywhere.

277
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,580
He is staying in the
living room on the couch.

278
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,910
He'd better.

279
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,950
That's your eldest daughter.

280
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,200
I think.

281
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,860
She makes me very proud.

282
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,750
What are you doing here?
How did you get in here?

283
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,220
That door was locked.

284
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,910
I used the key.

285
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,710
I know where the key i I
know where everything is.

286
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,960
Are you forgetting? I
live in this house, too.

287
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,880
Whatre you doing? What do you want?

288
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,820
Joe, I think I'm a murderer.

289
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,170
Okay, there we go.

290
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,130
Okay.

291
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,030
Okay, hold on. Hold
on. Okay. How's that?

292
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,290
A lot better.

293
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,530
Thanks, hon.

294
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,830
So start over.

295
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,220
Who is it that you think you killed?

296
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,500
Well, I don't really think
I killed anybody, but...

297
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,770
in my dream, Todd Emory-- the
guy who owns this body I'm in--

298
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,930
was burying a man, a dead man, the same dead body
I was looking at with Devalos when I collapsed.

299
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,120
Well, you know what we need to do.

300
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,260
We need to find out who
the hell this Todd Emory is.

301
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:59,230
According to this, you were
in theame hospital as my wife.

302
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,180
They thought he was in a coma, but then he
disappeared, and they can't figure out how.

303
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:03,800
{\a6}<i>******</i>

304
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,020
"Last seen shortly after 11:00
A. M. lying comatose in his bed."

305
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,530
11:00 A.M.-- isn't that around the time
that you, um, that you went into your coma?

306
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,700
- Yes.
- Okay.

307
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,700
All right, our friend Todd got
hit by a car two nights ago.

308
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,900
I guess he ran out in the middle
of a dark road in the woods,

309
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,380
and that's what put him into his coma.

310
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,660
"At this point,Emory has been
officially declared" a missing person.

311
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,430
"Anyone who has information as to his
whereabouts is urged to contact" the authorities.

312
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,510
His family is said...

313
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,330
to be offering a sizable reward."

314
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,450
Wow, Joe, the whole city's
looking for this guy.

315
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,610
Whole city is looking for me.
I mean, I can't leave the house.

316
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:43,330
I can't go anywhere or do anything
to help myself get out of this.

317
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,640
What are you doing?

318
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:01,500
Devalos told me that they found
some hairs on that dead man's body

319
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,250
that weren't his, so
you give this to him.

320
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,850
You just ask him if they
match the hair they found.

321
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,890
No explanations, no back stories.

322
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,850
Just ask him to test, and if
he gets a match, then you can...

323
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,160
You tell him I'm here.
And all the rest of it.

324
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,540
Listen, if not, nothing
ventured, nothing gained.

325
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,670
Okay, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

326
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,420
What do you mean?

327
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,700
Well, because if I give
this to Devalos, ***

328
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,960
u know, this new you, in a***

329
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,690
Oh, well, we have to do something.

330
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,780
What if I woke up as Todd
Emory? Because I'm supposed to...

331
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,980
bring him to justice for
murdering that John Doe.

332
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,360
No. But the way it stands right now, you
wouldn't be bringing Todd Emory to justice.

333
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,640
- You'd be bringing yourself.
- No, I don't think so.

334
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,250
Yes. No, I-I-I
think that

335
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,140
if the police can prove that Todd
Emory murdered that man in the park,

336
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,120
everything's going to go
back to normal. I-I just...

337
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,650
I just have to believe that.

338
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,110
I mean, when the kids wake
up, take them out to breakfast.

339
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,920
I-I don't want them to have to look
at me across the breakfast table.

340
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,240
I frighten them.

341
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,170
You sure sound like Allison.

342
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,100
Going out for pancakes on a school day?

343
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,750
Just when you think there's
no such thing as miracles.

344
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:26,200
I don't understand it. We're just
letting that stranger stay in our house?

345
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,620
Oh, hey, it wasn't my id.

346
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,260
I mean, it was.

347
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,850
I don't know, sweetie. I just.

348
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:37,510
I got an instinct about this guy that
he's grateful for a place to stay,

349
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:42,280
that he won't do anything, that he
won't, you know, take anything or...

350
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,270
Yeah, well, I hope you're right.

351
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,870
Any chance that he'll be gone by
the time we get home from school?

352
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:50,000
Listen, Ariel, we all want
the same thing here, okay?

353
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,060
Marie, what's going
on with you, sweetie?

354
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,390
You're awfully quiet.

355
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:02,610
She's sad about Mommy.
She wants her to come home.

356
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,970
And she's worried that if
she doesn't come back in time,

357
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,670
then she won't have a
coste for the school play.

358
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,780
Hey, maybe, hopefully, Mommy
will come home today, huh?

359
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,660
And if she doesn't then,
you know what we'll do?

360
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,060
We'll find somebody else
to sew you a costume, okay?

361
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,170
We'll do something. All right, sweetie?

362
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,310
Hey, you. Don't you worry.

363
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,410
Everything's going to be
back to normal real soon.

364
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,700
Well, I don't know how to descre it.

365
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,320
I mean, she's in the room, but it's as
if she's not really in the room at all.

366
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,730
Well, I felt like I
had to come and visit.

367
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,080
I agree with you now, dear.
It was probably pretty silly.

368
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,130
I'll see you at dinner. Okay.

369
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,410
I called your office, and
they said you were here.

370
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,360
Uh, little visit.

371
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,040
Doctors arare completely baffled.

372
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,660
Listen, I'll... I'll
leave the two of you alone.

373
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,400
No, no. I-I need to give you something.

374
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:17,690
Um, you and Allison were examining
a murder vtim when she collapsed,

375
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,690
and I know that you found some
hairs on his body that weren't his.

376
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,930
Could you test and see
if these match those?

377
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,260
I'm sorry. I guess I missed it, but
where did you say you got these from?

378
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,440
And how do you know about
this murder investigation?

379
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,570
I didn't. What does it matter?

380
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,360
If those don't match, we
have nothing to talk about.

381
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,490
And if they do, I'll tl you
everything you need to know.

382
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,730
Don't look so confused.

383
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,350
You've known me and my
family for a long time.

384
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,370
You're quite right.

385
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,400
Well, if you need anything, just...

386
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,770
Todd Emory?

387
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,620
I'm talking to you.

388
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,970
We haven't met, but I'm the landlord.

389
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,650
And I'm serving you
with an eviction notice.

390
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,320
You've been warned.

391
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,490
- Dadd'm home!
- Daddy, I'm home!

392
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,850
Dad, I'm back. I have the keys.

393
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,960
I've got the girls, and
I've got Ashley with...

394
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,990
What are you doing?

395
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,610
I'm trying to make a pea pod for peanut.

396
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,330
Do you actually know what you're doing?

397
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,750
Well, let's see. Come
here, you vegetable.

398
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,590
Let's see what is looks like. Come on.

399
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:03,130
Let's try this... on. Yeah. There we go.

400
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:10,900
Now, was... was that
more like you had in mind?

401
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,560
That looks almost as good
as something Mom would do.

402
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,980
Well, I take that as a compliment.

403
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,300
- Do I know you?
- No.

404
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,000
None of us know him.

405
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,940
Come on. Let's get you changed,
and I'll get you a snack.

406
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,940
Go.

407
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,600
Thank you.

408
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,760
You're very welcome, sweetie.

409
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:36,250
If Mommy's still sick and can't
come to the play, will y come?

410
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,170
Marie! You know what? No. Come on.

411
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,540
You couldn't keep me away.

412
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,860
Bye now.

413
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,880
Bye.

414
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,040
Who is it?

415
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,810
- Hey, are you in there?
- Yes. Is there a problem?

416
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,920
Oh, I've been looking all ov for you.

417
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:02,060
Um, how did you get in there without the
girls seeing you coming down the hall?

418
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:06,580
I went through the sliding glass door
in the kitchen, and I to the ck way.

419
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,970
Well, why aryou-you talking
to me through the door?

420
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,720
Why don't you just come in here?

421
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:16,680
Ah, yeah, you know, if it's just
the same, I-I think I'd rather not.

422
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,560
Oh, come on, Joe. It's ridiculous.

423
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:21,640
There's nothing in here
that you haven't seen before.

424
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,770
Oh, I beg to differ.

425
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,380
Honestly.

426
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,720
Um, here's the thing.

427
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:37,400
Is, I-I think have to take the girls
to the hospital to visit you tonight.

428
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,240
Visit Allison. Visit you.

429
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:43,340
I-I dot think that I can keep this
thing under wraps for too ch longer.

430
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:47,560
I think that Iave to
tell them about the coma.

431
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:51,420
About you.

432
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:57,350
And I... And I just want to let you know,
because things might get weird when we get home.

433
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,560
Weirder.

434
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,610
You're worried about Ariel, aren't you?

435
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,620
Well, you think that she's angry now...

436
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,990
Oh, I don't know. Maybe
I should just leave.

437
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:13,940
And then all you have to explain
is the coma, and you just...

438
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,690
you just spare them the rest.

439
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:21,830
Well, you know, I thought
about that, but the thing is...

440
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,540
I don't think that I want you to leave.

441
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,390
Oh, my God.

442
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,030
Well, are-are you expecting someone?

443
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,530
No. Stay right here.
Don't let anyone see you.

444
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,230
- Joe.
- Mr. District Attorney.

445
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,210
I'm sorry to show up unannounced.

446
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:52,660
First of all, for what it's worth, those hairs
that you gave me this morning, they, um...

447
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:56,760
They don't match the hairs that were
found on the body of that man in the park.

448
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:01,720
So whoever's hairs those might have been, they
probably have nothing to fear from the police.

449
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:06,040
All right. Well, I-I'm sure
that's a relief to someone.

450
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:11,040
In the meantime, we have figured out just
whose body that is we found out there.

451
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,470
Dead man was a private
investigator named Porter Hayes.

452
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,050
Specialized in divorce work.

453
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,610
Yeah, I know. You're thinking, "What
does any of this have to do with me?"

454
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,940
Have you, um... have you
ever seen this man before?

455
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,270
Only in the newspapers.

456
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:36,250
The mother of one of your daughter's friends
called the reward hotline early this evening.

457
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:41,000
Her little girl swears that she
saw this man in your house today.

458
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:48,810
Like you said at that hospital this
morning, I've known you folks a long time.

459
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,810
That hair that you gave
me?I'm no psychic, but, um,

460
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:56,140
I have a very strong feeling that
it might belong to Todd Emory.

461
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:02,240
Joe, if Todd Emory were here, if he
was hiding in your house, you'd...

462
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:05,640
you'd tell me, right?

463
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:10,070
I'm asking you a direct question.

464
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:14,910
That man has been missing from the hospital for
two days now, and I think you know where he is.

465
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,170
Is he here?

466
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,400
Good evening, Mr. District Attorney.

467
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:28,140
I'm Todd Emory. I think you're
asking some questions about me.

468
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,840
He's gone.

469
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,710
They took him back to the hospital.

470
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,650
Okay, so, why do you look so sad?

471
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,220
I mean, you didn't even know him, so...

472
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:53,190
I think I convinced myself that
if I could help this guy, that...

473
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:57,870
that somehow that would help
your mom get better, too.

474
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:00,290
I know it doesn't make a lot of sse.

475
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,220
- No, it doesn't.
- No.

476
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,660
He took a picture of you
guys with himhen he left.

477
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,970
I'm sorry if this upset you.

478
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,010
Okay.

479
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,020
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, sweetie.

480
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,580
Todd?

481
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:53,540
Oh, you don't know who I am, do you?

482
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,650
It's me.

483
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,560
Sam.

484
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,960
Samantha, your wife?

485
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,670
Oh, God.

486
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,640
The doctors said there'd
be some memory loss, but...

487
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,950
I'm sorry. Oh, everything's just a...

488
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,200
It's a bit of a blank right now.

489
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,690
That's amazing.

490
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,720
Even me? I'm a blank?

491
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,830
We've been married for seven years.

492
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,790
I'm sure everything is good...

493
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,110
will come back soon.

494
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,000
Oh, Todd.

495
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,230
Todd... the night that you were hit...

496
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,310
why were you out there
in the middle of nowhere?

497
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,080
I'm sorry. I just... I
don't... I don't have any idea.

498
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:04,280
The police said that they found
you in some strange family's house.

499
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,530
I can't explain that.

500
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,250
You don't remember
anything? Anything at all?

501
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,960
Dead man was a private
investigator named Porter Hayes.

502
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,840
Specialized in divorce work.

503
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:25,170
Porter Hayes. I think he
was a private investigator.

504
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:29,400
Yeah, for some reason,
that stuck in my head.

505
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,360
Excuse me? Sorry to interrupt.

506
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,700
I have a little something
to help Mr. Emory sleep.

507
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,360
Doctor's orders.

508
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,680
You did that really well, Todd.

509
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,300
Maybe you missed your calling in life.

510
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,300
Physical labor really seems to suit you.

511
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:30,450
You didn't have to kill
him. And you don't have to...

512
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,110
You don't have to kill me.

513
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,280
Well, you didn't leave
me much wiggle room, Todd.

514
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:39,170
We could have had a wonderful
life together, you and me.

515
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:43,010
You and me, me and my flings, but no.

516
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:47,120
You had to go and hire a private
investigator, get him to follow me around town,

517
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,110
taking all of those pictures. Why?

518
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,830
So you could divorce me
and leave me with nothing?

519
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,330
I don't think you understand
how this game is played, dear.

520
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,350
Go on. Get in the hole.

521
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,810
Well, lie down. Make
yourself comfortable.

522
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,600
You're going to be in there a while.

523
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,190
So, what are you going to do?

524
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,920
Are you going to shoot
me in theack of my head?

525
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,100
Yeah.

526
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:25,550
But I am going to have beautiful
thoughts about you while I do it.

527
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,760
Oh, you...

528
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,700
You shot me!

529
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,960
I can't believe that you shot me!

530
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,400
Well, you were going to shoot me.

531
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:49,360
- In the back of my head.
- No! No!

532
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:02,350
Oh, goodness. What's gng on?

533
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,600
Something wake you, darling?

534
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,020
Oh, something's gone wrong.

535
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,940
Oh, please call for help.

536
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:11,130
Nothing's wrong. It'll all be over soon.

537
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,760
That pain that you're feeling?

538
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,970
That's just the air bubblehat
I've injected into your IV line.

539
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:20,060
In just a few moments, it will reach
your brain, and all the pain will be gone.

540
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:26,010
No! No! No! No, no, it'll all be done by t
time the nurses finish their shift change.

541
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,210
Don't fight it, Todd.

542
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,150
This is just the way that it has to be.

543
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:38,070
Please. Please don't do this. Please?

544
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,370
Page Dr. Ancheta at home.
His patient in 404 is coding.

545
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,780
404? What's the patient's name?

546
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:45,400
Emory. Todd Emory.

547
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,410
I don't know what happened.
He just started convulsing.

548
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,110
Charging at 260.

549
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,490
******

550
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,750
Oh, God. Allison.

551
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,110
Clear.********

552
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,520
Joe?

553
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,380
Allison.

554
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,020
No. Actually, I'm Todd.

555
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,340
I'm Todd Emory.

556
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,450
- What?
- I'm sorry. I wish I could explain.

557
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,640
I just woke up.

558
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,150
It's like I've been asleep for days.

559
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,110
The things that I've seen.

560
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,470
Oh, the things that I've dreamt.

561
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:38,710
I know what your wife has done for me.

562
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,470
And I know what my wife did to me.

563
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,390
Come on, Mr. Emory. Come back.

564
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:54,090
******

565
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,910
Clear!

566
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,810
- darling.
- Darling.

567
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,980
Shame on you!

568
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,980
Shame on you! You damn
near killed that man's wife!

569
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,080
Excuse me? Are you...
are you talking to me?

570
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,650
o is this? Who are you? And who are you?

571
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,210
He... He is a wonderful man.

572
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,410
And that-that... That is
his wonderful wife! And I...

573
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,210
I'm your husband.

574
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,140
The one you've been trying
to kill for the last two days.

575
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,480
Someone call security!

576
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,950
This woman is crazy! I want her
out of here! What is she doing here?

577
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,700
Mrs. Dubois, why don't
we get you to your room.

578
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:37,110
You waited all nig until the
nurses went on their shift change.

579
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:43,110
And then you injected an air
bubble into my I.V.Into his I.V.

580
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,070
And that was after she tried
to shoot me in the woods,

581
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:49,620
so she could bury me along with the
private investigator she'd already killed.

582
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,250
Clear!

583
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:53,230
I have no idea what this
woman is talking about.

584
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,380
Tell that district attorney fellow
who was at your house last night.

585
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:00,060
We have some new hair to test. Her hair.

586
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,340
Come on! Come on! Give
us some of your hair!

587
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:05,700
If no one is going to escort these
people out of here, then I am leaving.

588
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:09,580
She's aving. And she's
taking her hair with her.

589
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,900
Allison?

590
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,110
Todd?

591
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,910
Anybody?

592
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,470
He's coming back.

593
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,560
Take my wife. Please.

594
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,060
Take my wife.

595
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,620
Please.

596
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,390
Be my wife. Be my wife.

597
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,700
Please be my wife.

598
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:59,760
I would love to be your wife.

599
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:03,840
Wait a second. I already am.

600
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:21,750
Samantha Emory, the young woman arrested
at White Peaks Hospital earlier in the week

601
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,940
for the attempted murder of her husband,

602
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:28,390
was also charged today in the murder
of private investigator Porter Hayes,

603
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,700
as DNA tests place her at the locion.

604
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,150
Girls! Hurry up! We got to meet
your dad, and we're going to be late.

605
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,620
I'm just saying. I hope the school
play ends differentlyhis year.

606
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:44,030
I an, ybe this ar, it'll turn out that
vegetables are actually bad for you.

607
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,860
Yeah, I wouldn't count on that.

608
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,320
Well, where's Marie?

609
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:51,280
I'm a pea po I'm part
the vegetable group.

610
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:56,530
To maintain a healy diet, you should
have three to five servings of me per day.

611
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,330
Yes!

612
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,860
Honey, that was wonderful!

613
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,480
Oh, sweetie, great!

614
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,190
But we got to get going. We're going to
be late. We have to pick up Uncle Todd.

615
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,350
Mommy, Uncle Todd made me my costume.

616
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,580
I know. Wasn't that nice of him?

617
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,910
He did a really good job.
Almost as good as you.

618
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,960
You don't say.
