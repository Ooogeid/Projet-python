1
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:38,210
You okay?
Everything all right?

2
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,980
I just had a dream.

3
00:00:42,817 --> 00:00:44,267
Anything important?

4
00:00:46,824 --> 00:00:47,882
I don't know.

5
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,351
I mean, a man did die,
but it was in the hospital.

6
00:00:50,476 --> 00:00:53,441
I don't think there's anything
to do or anyone to call.

7
00:01:21,952 --> 00:01:23,152
That's enough.

8
00:01:24,686 --> 00:01:25,886
That's enough.

9
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:55,478
Not funny. Come on. Wake up.

10
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:58,576
Come on.

11
00:01:58,989 --> 00:01:59,994
Joke over.

12
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:03,327
Please.

13
00:02:04,395 --> 00:02:05,750
Open up your eyes.

14
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:08,683
I'm begging you...
just open... your eyes.

15
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:10,671
Come on.

16
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:35,256
Didn't we already do this?

17
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,141
Transcript: www.1001fr.com

18
00:04:22,323 --> 00:04:24,773
Bridge, honey,
can you turn that down?

19
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:29,433
Lee, hi, this is Allison. Can you
give me a call when you get this?

20
00:04:29,724 --> 00:04:32,774
I had a dream last night.
I saw a young woman get,

21
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,289
redrumed.

22
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,600
Maybe it's something, maybe nothing.
I don't know. Give me a call.

23
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,030
Yes, indeed, nothing like a little
redrum to get you going in the morning.

24
00:04:41,735 --> 00:04:43,365
What is "redrum", mommy?

25
00:04:44,012 --> 00:04:47,299
Come on, everybody knows that
"redrum" is just "murder" spelled...

26
00:04:47,424 --> 00:04:49,910
Bridge, little ears.
That's why we use code words.

27
00:04:50,526 --> 00:04:52,976
- Sorry.
- It's okay. Just be careful.

28
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:55,127
What's "redrum"?

29
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,505
It's a kind of ice cream

30
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,523
that the tooth fairy
gives you if you're good.

31
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:02,968
Thank you.

32
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:05,354
Today is an excellent day.

33
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:07,899
Really? How is that possible?

34
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:09,599
It's barely begun.

35
00:05:10,673 --> 00:05:12,797
Today is the day I find out
who I'm having a baby with

36
00:05:12,922 --> 00:05:14,322
in wellness class.

37
00:05:16,907 --> 00:05:19,075
Please tell me
that's code for something.

38
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,948
You know what I mean.
All the sophomores have to do it.

39
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:24,570
You get paired
with a "marriage partner," and...

40
00:05:24,695 --> 00:05:27,875
then Mr. Parks gives us a baby
we have to take care of for a week.

41
00:05:28,138 --> 00:05:29,620
Really? A baby?

42
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:31,899
It's not a real baby,
it's this expensive doll,

43
00:05:32,024 --> 00:05:33,874
but it's almost as real
as a real baby.

44
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:38,375
They cry and coo
and burp and wet themselves.

45
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,755
Sounds like fun.

46
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:43,091
It's serious.
It's ten percent of your grade,

47
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:46,971
and it'd be nice if I ended up with
somebody I kind of liked as a husband.

48
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,475
I've always found that
to be helpful.

49
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,200
Bridge, can you turn
that back a channel?

50
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,175
<i>This was the scene this morning
as Finley Park rangers discovered</i>

51
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,504
<i>the bludgeoned body
of a young woman,</i>

52
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:59,149
<i>identified as Kimberly Weeks.</i>

53
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:00,967
What happened?

54
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,600
Lady ate too much redrum.
Right, mom?

55
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,799
- What are you doing here?
- I saw you on the news.

56
00:06:16,924 --> 00:06:19,585
I thought I'd come by,
maybe you'd give me an autograph.

57
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,506
Did you get my message?
I might have dreamt about this.

58
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,677
- Young woman, red cocktail dress?
- Don't suppose you saw who did it.

59
00:06:27,124 --> 00:06:30,313
Male, Caucasian, 50s-ish, nice suit,

60
00:06:30,438 --> 00:06:31,988
driving a luxury SUV.

61
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,101
- You got a good look at this guy.
- Front seat, 3:00 A.M. show.

62
00:06:36,324 --> 00:06:37,880
But here's the best part.

63
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:41,446
The girl scratched her killer's face
before she died... deep gouges.

64
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:43,404
I'm sure you're going to find
a wealth of DNA

65
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,210
under that poor girl's fingernails.

66
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:46,635
I beg to differ.

67
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:50,701
I don't think we're going to find
much of anything under her fingernails.

68
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:55,247
Somebody removed her fingernails?

69
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:57,179
Ripped 'em right out.

70
00:06:57,512 --> 00:07:00,528
Must have happened after he smashed her
in the head with the rock.

71
00:07:01,097 --> 00:07:03,422
Must have happened after I woke up.

72
00:07:03,744 --> 00:07:06,620
That's why I'm always hanging around
till the credits are over.

73
00:07:06,745 --> 00:07:09,855
They're always putting in extra things
during the credits these days.

74
00:07:15,898 --> 00:07:17,798
Will you excuse me a second?

75
00:07:27,617 --> 00:07:28,767
Are you okay?

76
00:07:32,337 --> 00:07:35,248
I saw what happened to you
last night at the hospital.

77
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,950
I'm so sorry.

78
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:40,267
I can see you.

79
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,212
I can see people like you.

80
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,475
I really need to talk to you
about what you witnessed...

81
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,900
here last night.

82
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,239
Meet me over there by the bathrooms
in about five minutes.

83
00:08:00,335 --> 00:08:01,603
Cal Jacobs

84
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,520
and... let's see... Marissa Masters.

85
00:08:07,845 --> 00:08:10,173
You are the proud parents
of a baby girl.

86
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:15,946
Hey, Ash, who's left other
than Adam and Marcos?

87
00:08:16,972 --> 00:08:20,622
We're not out of the woods yet.
We've still got the Unabomber.

88
00:08:21,672 --> 00:08:22,822
Jack White...

89
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,536
and Ashley Whitaker.

90
00:08:27,013 --> 00:08:28,600
I am so sorry.

91
00:08:42,103 --> 00:08:44,845
Adam Mankowicz and Ariel Dubois.

92
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:49,990
Thanks.

93
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:54,354
- Look what we made, Mrs. Mankowicz.
- Yeah.

94
00:08:58,193 --> 00:09:00,038
So I'll take the first shift.

95
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:03,936
I got an away game on Tuesday. Can you
take her for the next two nights?

96
00:09:04,061 --> 00:09:05,694
- Sure.
- Sweet.

97
00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:09,393
I'll call you.

98
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:16,971
If you were anyone else, I'd have you
arrested for intent to solicit.

99
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:20,017
You've been standing outside
this men's room for the past 20 minutes.

100
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:22,250
What can I say?
Times are tough.

101
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:25,499
I saw someone in the crowd
that I knew,

102
00:09:25,624 --> 00:09:28,689
and I thought we were going to meet up
here after I was done, but...

103
00:09:29,072 --> 00:09:32,377
Well, we're about to wrap it up across
the street, so I'm gonna take off.

104
00:09:33,002 --> 00:09:35,084
Meet me back at the station,
we could work up a sketch

105
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:36,939
of the killer you saw in your dream.

106
00:09:37,064 --> 00:09:39,153
Unless you got other business here.

107
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:43,100
- Funny. You're funny, funny, funny.
- We aim to please.

108
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:45,500
Okay, girls are down.

109
00:09:45,988 --> 00:09:47,638
Well, two out of three.

110
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,135
Who's the holdout?

111
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,690
The one busy writing
"Mrs. Ariel Mankowicz"

112
00:09:51,815 --> 00:09:54,051
on every available inch
of her notebook.

113
00:09:55,431 --> 00:09:58,097
The good news is
she's considering hyphenating.

114
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,899
I'm trying to steer her
towards Dubois-Mankowicz

115
00:10:01,024 --> 00:10:03,644
over the less husband-friendly
Mankowicz-Dubois.

116
00:10:04,232 --> 00:10:05,799
What you looking at?

117
00:10:05,924 --> 00:10:06,924
Mug books.

118
00:10:07,324 --> 00:10:09,285
Trying to see
if there's anyone in here

119
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,703
who even looks vaguely similar
to the man I saw

120
00:10:12,164 --> 00:10:13,799
kill that girl last night.

121
00:10:13,924 --> 00:10:15,374
Oh, yeah, any luck?

122
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:18,148
Nope, it was a long shot.

123
00:10:18,273 --> 00:10:20,288
The man in my dream
wasn't a career criminal.

124
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:22,913
He looked like an executive
or a lawyer

125
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:24,957
or some successful businessman.

126
00:10:25,776 --> 00:10:27,292
What I can't figure out is

127
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:29,314
why that ghost didn't help me.

128
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:30,839
He saw everything.

129
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,999
I know. Would it have killed him
to talk to you?

130
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,180
Not funny.

131
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,257
I put today's mail
on your desk, sir.

132
00:10:46,382 --> 00:10:48,354
Fine. Hold all my calls.

133
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,008
Yes?

134
00:11:16,191 --> 00:11:18,396
<i>You make it to work okay
this morning?</i>

135
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,630
Excuse me?

136
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,232
May I ask who's calling?

137
00:11:23,357 --> 00:11:25,607
<i>You were a busy boy last night.</i>

138
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,020
I'm... I'm sorry.
Who am I talking to?

139
00:11:29,145 --> 00:11:30,702
<i>Someone who knows everything</i>

140
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:34,067
<i>about the last two minutes
of poor Kimberly Weeks' life.</i>

141
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,524
<i>That was her real name, you know.</i>

142
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:40,170
<i>Or maybe you didn't, but I do.
I know everything:</i>

143
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,426
<i>how it went from playful
to really, really rough.</i>

144
00:11:45,847 --> 00:11:48,467
<i>- What do you want?
- $500,000.</i>

145
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:52,447
I don't have that kind of money.

146
00:11:52,572 --> 00:11:54,813
<i>I bet you can get your hands on it.</i>

147
00:11:54,938 --> 00:11:57,175
<i>And that's why I sent you
a little incentive.</i>

148
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:00,376
<i>Do you see a brown paper package
lying on your desk?</i>

149
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:03,190
<i>Go on. Open it.</i>

150
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,770
<i>Take a look inside.</i>

151
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,367
Oh, my God.

152
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:18,320
<i>First one's on the house...</i>

153
00:12:23,963 --> 00:12:25,937
So in addition
to looking for a killer,

154
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:28,799
we're now supposed to be looking for
someone who's blackmailing the killer?

155
00:12:28,924 --> 00:12:30,674
One fingernail at a time.

156
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,679
If we can't keep the world
safe for murderers...

157
00:12:34,731 --> 00:12:37,881
Any clue as to the identity
of this woman?

158
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:40,975
No. I didn't see her face.
I only heard her voice.

159
00:12:41,229 --> 00:12:44,470
But she knew everything about
the killer. He knew nothing about her.

160
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:46,675
- Maybe it was someone she worked with.
- Worked?

161
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,476
I thought she was a student
at Mesa University.

162
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,604
Well, we have reason to believe
that what you witnessed

163
00:12:52,729 --> 00:12:54,977
wasn't just the end
of a date gone wrong.

164
00:12:55,102 --> 00:12:57,840
It appears Kimberly helped pay
her tuition by...

165
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:01,464
entertaining men.
Nights. Weekends.

166
00:13:03,404 --> 00:13:06,108
We're following up some leads.
Looking at her computer and cell phone.

167
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:09,246
Trying to see if anybody matches
the description of that businessman.

168
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,426
Well, whoever this blackmailer is,
one thing seems pretty clear.

169
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:15,251
She was a witness
to Kimberly's murder. So,

170
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:18,920
if Allison's dream is accurate,
she knows how to contact the killer.

171
00:13:19,045 --> 00:13:21,800
Sounds like if we find her,
we can find him.

172
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,375
Looks like you survived
your first night.

173
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,186
- Yeah. Sorry about all the phone calls.
- No. It's okay.

174
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:37,297
This baby should really come with a
Get Out of Trig Test Free or something.

175
00:13:37,422 --> 00:13:39,822
I don't know how I gonna stay awake
for my next exam.

176
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:41,611
She woke me up
four times last night.

177
00:13:42,748 --> 00:13:45,435
Well, I don't know.
You look pretty comfortable with her.

178
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,576
It's kind of like
holding a football.

179
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,911
Well, you can pass her to me now.

180
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,245
Are you all right?

181
00:14:07,732 --> 00:14:10,297
I feel really great.
Just a little dizzy.

182
00:14:10,422 --> 00:14:13,556
But maybe you can
just put her in here.

183
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,570
Yeah, all right.

184
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,932
You should have seen the look
on their faces when I told them

185
00:14:21,057 --> 00:14:23,999
we needed to be looking
for a blackmailer and a killer.

186
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,999
Oh, that brings back memories.

187
00:14:27,124 --> 00:14:30,195
- Ariel, tend to your child.
- She can't hear you.

188
00:14:30,997 --> 00:14:32,996
I can't hear me. Ariel?!

189
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,669
I sang to her,
I told her some jokes,

190
00:14:40,305 --> 00:14:42,448
- but she's still crying.
- Don't play with that.

191
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:44,131
That's Ariel's wellness project.

192
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,670
But I'm baby-sitting.

193
00:14:45,795 --> 00:14:47,842
Ariel's paying me a dollar an hour.

194
00:14:48,326 --> 00:14:50,444
She's paying you to do her homework?

195
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,375
You take that baby back to Ariel,
and tell her that your shift is over.

196
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:56,364
And if she can't stop
her child from crying,

197
00:14:56,489 --> 00:14:58,176
I'm gonna call
social services on her.

198
00:14:58,301 --> 00:15:00,254
But I still got my dollar, right?

199
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:01,979
<i>Who am I talking to?</i>

200
00:15:02,178 --> 00:15:04,565
Someone who knows
about the last two minutes

201
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,640
of poor Kimberly Weeks' life.

202
00:15:07,676 --> 00:15:09,815
That was her real name, you know.

203
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,069
Or maybe you didn't, but I do.

204
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:14,199
I know everything

205
00:15:14,324 --> 00:15:15,697
where you took her;

206
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:18,259
how it went from playful to rough

207
00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:20,918
to really, really rough.

208
00:15:22,058 --> 00:15:24,541
- <i>What do you want?</i>
- $500,000.

209
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:27,026
I don't have that kind of money.

210
00:15:27,282 --> 00:15:29,342
I bet you can get your hands on it.

211
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:31,327
That's why I sent you
a little incentive.

212
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:34,306
Do you see a brown paper package

213
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,842
lying on your desk?

214
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:38,811
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Go on. Open it.

215
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,160
Take a look inside.

216
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:46,699
<i>Oh. Oh, my God.</i>

217
00:15:46,824 --> 00:15:48,574
First one's on the house.

218
00:15:49,945 --> 00:15:52,145
The other nine are gonna cost you.

219
00:16:02,205 --> 00:16:03,205
Ariel?!

220
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,100
Suddenly, I'm not looking
forward to being a grandfather.

221
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,602
Nope. I'm not there.
I somehow managed to survive the night.

222
00:16:23,287 --> 00:16:24,887
What are you doing up?

223
00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:28,561
It's barely 6:30. You're all dressed,
you're ready for work.

224
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:32,299
I couldn't sleep. I decided I'd come out
here and try to find my ghost.

225
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,288
The one I keep seeing in my dreams.

226
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,584
First he's on hand
to witness a murder.

227
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:38,875
The next day,
he's at the crime scene.

228
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,709
Now, according to my dream last night,
he's spending time with the blackmailer,

229
00:16:43,563 --> 00:16:45,663
listening in on her phone calls.

230
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:48,942
What are you saying? That he's following
the same case you are?

231
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:52,213
It seems that way. All the more reason
for me to try to find him.

232
00:16:52,338 --> 00:16:54,804
Clearly, this guy knows more
about this whole thing than I do.

233
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:58,206
So, what are you looking at? I mean,
how do you track a ghost, exactly?

234
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:00,726
Is there some kind of
secret website?

235
00:17:03,276 --> 00:17:06,483
Look, according to my dream, he died
the same night that girl Kimberly did.

236
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:10,967
So I've been looking through
the obituaries for last night and today,

237
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:12,575
but I'm not finding anything.

238
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,033
Maybe you're going at it
from the other direction.

239
00:17:18,795 --> 00:17:19,799
Meaning?

240
00:17:19,924 --> 00:17:23,499
Well, you know, when old Mrs.
What's-Her-Name down the street died...

241
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:27,182
... it took her husband, like,
three weeks after the funeral

242
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:29,497
to get around to putting
an obit in the paper.

243
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:32,926
The obituary writer is, like,
the last guy to know when someone dies.

244
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,678
You need to find the first guy.

245
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,271
You're right.

246
00:17:38,963 --> 00:17:42,700
White Peaks Regional Hospital. May I
put you on hold for just one moment?

247
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,302
I'm sorry. We can't release
a patient's personal health

248
00:17:46,427 --> 00:17:49,520
- information without a court order.
- I understand. Really.

249
00:17:49,645 --> 00:17:52,272
I do, and as I told you, I work
for the District Attorney's office,

250
00:17:52,397 --> 00:17:55,053
and I'm not asking for
any personal information.

251
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,948
I just wanted to know if a man matching
the description I gave you died here,

252
00:17:59,073 --> 00:18:01,538
and if he did, what his name is.

253
00:18:04,197 --> 00:18:07,297
Please. It pertains to the murder
of a young woman.

254
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:13,789
You say he was Caucasian?

255
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,493
Around 30?

256
00:18:20,778 --> 00:18:23,778
If I could tell you
what you want me to tell you,

257
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:26,438
I wouldn't have anything
to tell you.

258
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,183
Mind if I have a seat?

259
00:18:52,735 --> 00:18:54,174
Is that your wife and daughter?

260
00:18:56,623 --> 00:18:58,428
They must miss you terribly.

261
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,675
Listen, who... who are you,
and what do you want?

262
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,650
I told you what I wanted
that day in the park.

263
00:19:08,453 --> 00:19:11,829
I want to know what you know
about the murder of Kimberly Weeks.

264
00:19:11,954 --> 00:19:13,833
I know you saw the whole thing.

265
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:17,199
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

266
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:20,322
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

267
00:19:21,374 --> 00:19:24,245
You were there the night she died
and the next day at the crime scene.

268
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:28,084
And then you listened in while a woman
tried to blackmail the murderer.

269
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,600
Listen, I know you are going
through a terribly difficult time,

270
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:35,781
trying to deal with your mortality,

271
00:19:35,906 --> 00:19:38,679
to make peace with the fact
that your life is over.

272
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,054
It's a huge adjustment.

273
00:19:42,276 --> 00:19:44,176
But I really need your help.

274
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,376
- Did you see me, Daddy?
- Yeah.

275
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:48,206
Yes, I saw you, sweetheart.

276
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:51,606
Now, come on. Go grab Mommy.
It's almost time to go.

277
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:56,275
Look, I don't know who you are

278
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,228
or what you think you know,

279
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,490
but I have surgery in 20 minutes,

280
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:04,458
so I'd appreciate it if you let me
and my family finish our lunch.

281
00:20:10,072 --> 00:20:12,575
So let me see if I understand this.
This looks exactly

282
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,004
like the woman you saw
blackmailing Kimberly Weeks' killer,

283
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,757
but you don't want us
to distribute it?

284
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:19,467
That's right.

285
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:22,065
Any particular reason?

286
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,357
I guess I'm just not certain
of the accuracy

287
00:20:24,482 --> 00:20:26,379
of my dreams
pertaining to this case.

288
00:20:26,504 --> 00:20:29,828
The description of that woman,
I'm not sure I can stand behind it.

289
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:33,523
Am I allowed to ask what triggered
this crisis in confidence?

290
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,780
It's a long story.

291
00:20:36,888 --> 00:20:38,680
In my dreams, I saw someone,

292
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:41,489
a ghost, who witnessed both
the murder and the blackmail.

293
00:20:42,227 --> 00:20:44,394
- A ghost?
- He died of cardiac arrest

294
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:47,959
a few minutes before Kimberly found
herself in the car with her killer.

295
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:50,016
And I've been searching for him,

296
00:20:50,322 --> 00:20:52,332
this ghost, ever since that night

297
00:20:53,366 --> 00:20:55,598
to see what he knows,
to see what he saw.

298
00:20:55,811 --> 00:20:58,487
And I actually found him this morning.
The problem is,

299
00:20:59,244 --> 00:21:01,735
he's about as far from dead
as you can possibly get.

300
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,262
He's actually alive and well
and living in Scottsdale.

301
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:07,388
- The ghost?
- His name is Dr. Brian Seward.

302
00:21:07,653 --> 00:21:09,767
He's a surgeon at White Peaks
Regional Hospital.

303
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:14,147
Obviously, he's not dead.
Obviously, he didn't see anything.

304
00:21:14,722 --> 00:21:17,323
Which makes me wonder
if any of the things I saw,

305
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,672
or any of the things
that I dreamt actually

306
00:21:19,797 --> 00:21:21,725
happened the way that I saw them.

307
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:28,200
Ariel, I'm on a work call here.
Can you please take care of that baby?

308
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,745
Mitch, hold on one second, will you?
Allison?!

309
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:35,570
- I'm giving Marie a bath.
- Ariel?!

310
00:21:37,238 --> 00:21:39,501
- Bridgette!
- I don't have it.

311
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:42,300
And Ariel's in her room
with the door shut.

312
00:21:43,738 --> 00:21:46,020
Look, sorry, Mitch.
Can I call you right back?

313
00:21:46,386 --> 00:21:47,386
Thanks.

314
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,370
Yeah, Dad?

315
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:02,386
Do you not hear this?

316
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:05,038
- Sorry, Dad.
- "Sorry, Dad"?

317
00:22:05,163 --> 00:22:06,754
Is that the best you can do?

318
00:22:06,976 --> 00:22:09,834
Do a better job of taking care of
that baby. That is your assignment.

319
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:12,820
That's not your mother's,
not your sister's, not mine. It's yours.

320
00:22:13,273 --> 00:22:15,967
No. I know.
I just, uh, I don't know.

321
00:22:17,032 --> 00:22:19,733
I don't really want to move.
I don't want to think. I just...

322
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:22,048
want to lay down
and listen to music.

323
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:25,784
What's going on with you?
You feeling all right?

324
00:22:26,376 --> 00:22:29,033
I feel really good.
I just... kinda hungry.

325
00:22:29,158 --> 00:22:31,057
But really good.

326
00:22:35,273 --> 00:22:36,923
Sorry about the crying.

327
00:22:37,576 --> 00:22:39,575
Do you think Mom bought chips?

328
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,244
If she weren't our daughter,

329
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:43,299
I would have sworn
she was high as a kite.

330
00:22:43,424 --> 00:22:46,107
- Don't say that.
- I'm just telling you what I saw.

331
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:48,253
She even went looking for munchies.

332
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,930
- Did somebody scream?
- You all right? What's going on?

333
00:22:53,055 --> 00:22:55,975
There was a man in the house.
He was standing right there.

334
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:57,999
What are you talking about?

335
00:22:58,124 --> 00:23:00,099
I was feeding the baby,

336
00:23:00,224 --> 00:23:02,569
and I got hungry so I went
for a snack and then I came back

337
00:23:02,694 --> 00:23:05,999
and saw him standing right there,
listening to what you guys were saying.

338
00:23:06,283 --> 00:23:07,599
He was outside our door?

339
00:23:07,724 --> 00:23:10,555
- Sweetie, there's no one here.
- I screamed and he disappeared.

340
00:23:11,185 --> 00:23:12,765
- Where did he go?
- I don't know!

341
00:23:13,498 --> 00:23:15,485
He was there, and then he was gone.

342
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,035
Okay, I'm going to go check the house.
You, you stand over there.

343
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,752
Be careful, Joe. Here.

344
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,704
I don't understand.
Did he say anything?

345
00:23:24,895 --> 00:23:26,154
What did he look like?

346
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,453
He didn't look like anything.
He was just standing there

347
00:23:28,578 --> 00:23:30,770
listening to what you
and Daddy were saying.

348
00:23:31,557 --> 00:23:33,099
I don't know. He had...

349
00:23:33,224 --> 00:23:35,246
sandy hair and wearing a white coat.

350
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,148
Wait, wait, a white coat
like a doctor's coat?

351
00:23:39,803 --> 00:23:42,432
I checked inside.
I checked outside. Nothing.

352
00:23:42,969 --> 00:23:45,299
This house is sealed up
tight as a drum.

353
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,254
I don't know what to tell you.

354
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:51,721
Thought this bed would be wall-to-wall
girls I climbed back into it already.

355
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,206
Everyone's in their rooms.
Everyone's in their beds.

356
00:23:56,948 --> 00:23:58,478
I'm concerned about Ariel.

357
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,791
I'm telling you something's not right.
She's acting very strangely.

358
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:04,260
All this snacking? Now she's seeing
people who aren't there.

359
00:24:04,385 --> 00:24:06,981
I don't know about that seeing people
that aren't there part.

360
00:24:07,106 --> 00:24:09,632
I mean, the man that she described
sounded an awful lot like

361
00:24:09,757 --> 00:24:12,267
that Dr. Brian Seward
I spoke with today.

362
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:14,495
The living dead guy?

363
00:24:14,937 --> 00:24:18,575
Allison, come on, I just checked
every window and every door.

364
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:21,876
- No human being could get in here.
- Well, what about a ghost?

365
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,699
Honestly, honey, he's not a ghost.

366
00:24:24,824 --> 00:24:26,979
Come on, you just said yourself
you saw him today,

367
00:24:27,104 --> 00:24:28,781
interacting with his kid.

368
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:31,552
Didn't you say he's like a registered
surgeon at that hospital?

369
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,299
So either he's alive and running around
playing with his kids,

370
00:24:36,424 --> 00:24:39,288
or he's dead and... and scaring
the heck out of mine,

371
00:24:39,838 --> 00:24:41,566
but he can't be both. Right?

372
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:43,045
Right.

373
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,807
Just do me a favor.

374
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:49,005
Just keep an eye on Ariel tomorrow. Then
when I get home, we'll compare notes.

375
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,490
Of course.

376
00:25:42,857 --> 00:25:45,035
Okay, Victoria. It's time.

377
00:26:02,714 --> 00:26:05,607
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

378
00:26:09,845 --> 00:26:11,395
That was a close one.

379
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,150
Just tell me you saw something good.

380
00:26:18,506 --> 00:26:21,454
Someone really rich doing
something really bad?

381
00:26:23,307 --> 00:26:26,007
Actually,
I didn't just see something good.

382
00:26:27,848 --> 00:26:29,248
I saw a gold mine.

383
00:26:37,256 --> 00:26:39,576
You were at my house
last night, weren't you?

384
00:26:40,492 --> 00:26:42,131
Don't even bother denying it.

385
00:26:42,256 --> 00:26:44,111
I think I know
what you're up to, Dr. Seward,

386
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:46,437
and I'm not going
to let you get away with it.

387
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,445
Exactly what have I been up to?

388
00:26:55,388 --> 00:26:58,128
I don't know what kind of weird
adrenaline junkie you are.

389
00:26:58,253 --> 00:27:00,675
I don't know how you
figured out how to do it,

390
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:02,699
but you're killing yourself
a little bit,

391
00:27:02,824 --> 00:27:06,075
making yourself into a ghost
so you can see people's secrets,

392
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,118
and then you bring yourself
back to life

393
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:10,127
so you and your partner
can blackmail them.

394
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,342
You actually said that
out loud in front of an adult.

395
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,404
I admire your courage.

396
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,098
But you must know
how absurd that sounds.

397
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,691
Don't worry about it.
I don't have to prove the "absurd" part.

398
00:27:24,816 --> 00:27:27,140
I just have to prove
that you're a blackmailer.

399
00:27:27,394 --> 00:27:29,539
And it's only a matter
of time until I do.

400
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,164
And in the meantime,

401
00:27:31,574 --> 00:27:33,697
stay away from my house.

402
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,750
Stay away from my family.

403
00:27:36,425 --> 00:27:37,825
Stay away from me.

404
00:27:39,445 --> 00:27:41,245
You know, it's not what you think.

405
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,870
I'm not some greedy,
thrill-seeking bastard.

406
00:27:48,979 --> 00:27:49,979
I'm dying.

407
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:52,763
You see this oval here?

408
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:54,783
That's a tumor.

409
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:59,070
Apparently, it's been growing
in my brain for at least five years.

410
00:28:00,373 --> 00:28:01,699
Yeah, I had no idea.

411
00:28:01,824 --> 00:28:04,221
I mean, I used to get headaches,
but who doesn't?

412
00:28:05,555 --> 00:28:07,686
And then, one day last September,

413
00:28:08,336 --> 00:28:09,951
I just collapsed.

414
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,983
I was clinically dead
for almost three minutes.

415
00:28:15,052 --> 00:28:16,489
And I remembered

416
00:28:17,471 --> 00:28:18,779
every moment of it.

417
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:22,794
I could choose to be anywhere,
watch anything,

418
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:25,601
anyone I wanted to see,
and they couldn't see me.

419
00:28:27,885 --> 00:28:30,541
And just as I was getting
the hang of it, I was back.

420
00:28:31,563 --> 00:28:33,711
They shocked my heart,
and I was back.

421
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,157
That's when I got the good news.

422
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,090
18 months to live.

423
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:40,927
Two years tops.

424
00:28:41,147 --> 00:28:43,514
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, you and me both.

425
00:28:45,846 --> 00:28:46,846
Look...

426
00:28:48,107 --> 00:28:49,525
I'm only a resident.

427
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:52,505
Okay, I drop dead tomorrow,
no medical bills,

428
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:56,154
I will still leave my wife
with a hundred thousand dollars

429
00:28:56,854 --> 00:28:58,582
of med school tuition I owe,

430
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,124
not to mention the mortgage,
my daughter's school.

431
00:29:04,444 --> 00:29:06,622
I mean, come on.
It's kind of genius.

432
00:29:07,522 --> 00:29:10,376
You stop the heart
with a few ccs of diazepam.

433
00:29:11,188 --> 00:29:13,968
You get a whole three minutes
before brain damage sets in.

434
00:29:15,303 --> 00:29:17,584
After that, it's just CPR 101.

435
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,406
Every ambulance driver
in the country

436
00:29:20,531 --> 00:29:22,920
is trained on how to bring
the dead back to life.

437
00:29:24,491 --> 00:29:26,138
You think it's depraved, don't you?

438
00:29:26,613 --> 00:29:28,823
I think there has to be another way.

439
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:31,895
What you're doing is illegal.

440
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,152
And it's dangerous.

441
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,389
What if you don't come back next time?
Where does that leave your family?

442
00:29:37,514 --> 00:29:40,027
You don't understand.
I don't have a choice.

443
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,319
No, you don't understand.
There is no choice.

444
00:29:42,444 --> 00:29:44,303
I will bring a case against you.

445
00:29:44,807 --> 00:29:46,828
Even if you're right,
even if I can't prove it,

446
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:50,319
is that really how you want to spend
this little bit of time you have left?

447
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:54,542
Putting your family through the stress
and the expense of a trial?

448
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,948
- So what exactly is it that you want?
- I want you to stop.

449
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:04,179
I want you to give me the name of
the man who murdered Kimberly Weeks.

450
00:30:07,102 --> 00:30:09,891
- And in return?
- In return, this conversation

451
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,184
will stay in this room.

452
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:18,089
Okay, I'll tell you what.

453
00:30:19,797 --> 00:30:23,182
I'll throw in the nine bloody
fingernails that will prove that

454
00:30:23,307 --> 00:30:27,062
the man whose name I'm going to give you
is the one who killed her in exchange

455
00:30:27,563 --> 00:30:29,707
- for your word.
- My word?

456
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:32,580
That the man isn't arrested
until after 5:00 today.

457
00:30:32,975 --> 00:30:35,374
Why? Are you and your partner
getting paid off at 4:59?

458
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:36,917
Do we have a deal?

459
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,010
What if I say no?

460
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:42,590
I might just forget the man's name.

461
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,051
I might just lose those fingernails.

462
00:30:47,965 --> 00:30:51,265
I have something at stake.
You have something at stake.

463
00:30:52,348 --> 00:30:54,398
That's why they call it a deal.

464
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,550
Sorry. I don't know
what happened to me yesterday.

465
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:02,286
I was like a dead person.

466
00:31:02,492 --> 00:31:03,792
Yeah, I noticed.

467
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:11,920
Totally spaced. I couldn't do
a thing but lay on my bed.

468
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,559
And then when I saw
the dead guy, I couldn't sleep.

469
00:31:14,684 --> 00:31:17,166
So I had to wake up this morning
at 4:30 to do my homework.

470
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,050
But you're feeling all right now?

471
00:31:20,885 --> 00:31:24,255
No, I'm fine.
I'm just a little tired, but fine.

472
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:34,433
Look, there's Adam.

473
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:40,231
Great. I can... it's his turn.
So I can give him the baby now.

474
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,399
Okay.

475
00:31:44,891 --> 00:31:47,275
Good driving, sweetie.
Now you have a great day.

476
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,527
Mom will pick you up this afternoon.

477
00:31:58,714 --> 00:31:59,792
You okay?

478
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,794
No, I just... everything's kind
of starting to spin.

479
00:32:06,762 --> 00:32:08,342
I could really go for a cookie.

480
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,044
Ariel, look at you.

481
00:32:11,748 --> 00:32:14,139
I don't really think I can do that.

482
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:17,679
Give me that doll.

483
00:32:21,911 --> 00:32:23,190
That was weird.

484
00:32:24,449 --> 00:32:25,895
You feel okay now?

485
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:33,045
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

486
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:35,234
When the doll was in the back seat,
you were fine,

487
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,368
and then as soon as you got close
to it... But I don't smell anything.

488
00:32:39,145 --> 00:32:42,334
Give me the doll. I'll give it
to Adam before the bell rings.

489
00:32:45,973 --> 00:32:48,841
Hey, you know what? You go ahead
to class. I'll give the doll to Adam.

490
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:51,841
But... Dad, I mean,
what if the teacher sees?

491
00:32:51,966 --> 00:32:54,232
The teacher's not going to see.
You go to class.

492
00:32:54,357 --> 00:32:56,098
Let me give the doll to Adam.

493
00:32:56,451 --> 00:32:58,488
Ariel, I'll give the doll to Adam.

494
00:33:02,057 --> 00:33:04,273
Hey, Adam, Adam Mankowicz?

495
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,903
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

496
00:33:07,534 --> 00:33:11,196
I guess you could say that
I'm your father-in-law. Joe Dubois.

497
00:33:12,307 --> 00:33:14,567
Ariel's father.
Nice to meet you, sir.

498
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:17,207
- Special delivery.
- Thank you.

499
00:33:19,441 --> 00:33:21,599
You gonna be okay looking after her?

500
00:33:21,724 --> 00:33:23,167
Your eyes look a little red.

501
00:33:25,984 --> 00:33:27,921
No, sir. I'm fine. I have allergies.

502
00:33:29,072 --> 00:33:30,072
Really?

503
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,388
How often
do you get these allergies?

504
00:33:34,285 --> 00:33:36,341
I mean, are we talking every night?

505
00:33:36,989 --> 00:33:39,516
After school? Before school?

506
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,916
How about at night,
when your parents aren't home?

507
00:33:44,317 --> 00:33:45,766
I really need to go.

508
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:48,358
Do your parents even know
about these allergies?

509
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,070
No, I didn't think so.

510
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:54,559
So let me ask you something.
The other night,

511
00:33:54,684 --> 00:33:56,606
when it was your turn
to take care of the baby,

512
00:33:56,731 --> 00:33:58,478
did you have allergies then?

513
00:33:59,251 --> 00:34:00,454
I might have.

514
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:03,052
Well, guess what, son?
You're getting a divorce.

515
00:34:03,813 --> 00:34:05,357
- What?
- That's right.

516
00:34:05,902 --> 00:34:08,299
And you've won sole custody
of that baby.

517
00:34:08,509 --> 00:34:11,215
You're gonna raise her on your own from
now until the end of the assignment.

518
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,614
That's not fair,

519
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:15,268
because me and Ariel are supposed
to finish this project together.

520
00:34:15,393 --> 00:34:18,086
Adam, you wouldn't want
me to have to tell your parents

521
00:34:18,211 --> 00:34:20,349
about these allergies of yours,
would you?

522
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:25,456
- You can't do that, that's blackmail.
- Maybe you'd like to take this up

523
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:28,681
with your ex mother-in-law,
who works for Phoenix Police Department?

524
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:31,652
- No, sir.
- Then we understand each other?

525
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:38,290
If I ever get the sense that
you've given my daughter your allergies,

526
00:34:38,496 --> 00:34:39,934
I know where to find you.

527
00:34:41,332 --> 00:34:43,943
<i>Local attorney Patrick Davidson
was arrested today</i>

528
00:34:44,068 --> 00:34:47,167
<i>for the murder of Mesa University
student Kimberly Weeks.</i>

529
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:50,599
<i>Police say that an anonymous tip
led them to the discovery</i>

530
00:34:50,724 --> 00:34:52,499
<i>of nine of the victims' fingernails,</i>

531
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:55,238
<i>which were apparently removed
shortly after the murder.</i>

532
00:34:55,778 --> 00:34:58,631
<i>The fingernails, all of them
covered with the lawyer's DNA,</i>

533
00:34:58,908 --> 00:35:01,014
- <i>helped seal the case against Davidson.</i>
- Good.

534
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:02,521
Good for you.

535
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,475
- Well, good for everybody, I hope.
- What is that supposed to mean?

536
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,103
I don't know. I just don't feel right
about Dr. Seward

537
00:35:09,228 --> 00:35:12,666
just walking away from this whole thing
with $500,000 of ill-gotten gains.

538
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:14,249
It's for his family.

539
00:35:14,522 --> 00:35:16,911
I know, that's what I keep
telling myself.

540
00:35:18,022 --> 00:35:20,367
But we can't stop. Not now.

541
00:35:20,891 --> 00:35:22,899
I don't know what to tell you, Vic.

542
00:35:23,024 --> 00:35:25,215
Tell me, you'll do it again.

543
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,029
At least one more time. After that,

544
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,350
if you want to walk away...

545
00:35:33,116 --> 00:35:34,994
Think of your family, Brian.

546
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,258
A quarter of a million dollars
is nothing.

547
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:41,830
Once you're gone, what do you suppose
they're going to live on?

548
00:35:42,064 --> 00:35:44,558
You don't understand;
I don't have a choice. Okay?

549
00:35:44,939 --> 00:35:47,516
- That woman from the DA's office...
- What about her?

550
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:49,617
Does she have a badge?

551
00:35:50,092 --> 00:35:51,092
A gun?

552
00:35:51,737 --> 00:35:54,193
She's just a fortune-teller, Brian.

553
00:35:54,836 --> 00:35:58,125
She can't tell anyone about us.
No one would believe her.

554
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:02,812
We ended up on her radar

555
00:36:03,063 --> 00:36:04,865
because the man we were blackmailing

556
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,706
was the #1 suspect
in a murder investigation.

557
00:36:08,461 --> 00:36:09,636
From now on,

558
00:36:09,761 --> 00:36:12,682
we just pick someone who is
of no interest to the DA's office,

559
00:36:12,807 --> 00:36:15,660
some rich guy, cheating on his wife.

560
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:21,811
She'll never even know.

561
00:36:50,031 --> 00:36:51,708
10:17...

562
00:36:53,203 --> 00:36:54,875
Mrs. James Richardson,

563
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:58,446
do you know
where your beloved husband is?

564
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:00,219
I'm betting you don't.

565
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,552
Good thing you're a banker, pal.
It's going to cost you.

566
00:37:10,983 --> 00:37:14,063
Okay, Victoria,
hit me with the paddles.

567
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:16,938
I'm running out of time.

568
00:38:26,936 --> 00:38:27,936
Hello?

569
00:38:28,616 --> 00:38:29,766
Anybody here?

570
00:38:31,825 --> 00:38:33,769
Hi. I'm Allison.
I'm Allison Dubois.

571
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,498
I don't think we've officially met,
but I think you know about me.

572
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,629
I'm the fortune-teller,
the one with no badge or no gun.

573
00:38:44,095 --> 00:38:46,536
Please, have a seat.
I ordered you something.

574
00:38:48,604 --> 00:38:50,099
You ordered me something?

575
00:38:50,224 --> 00:38:52,918
I didn't even know I was going
to stop in here until a minute ago.

576
00:38:53,228 --> 00:38:56,625
But Brian did, he's the one who told me
you'd be coming. Please, sit.

577
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,288
Well,
he wanted me to say "hi" to you.

578
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:06,770
Brian, I mean.

579
00:39:07,787 --> 00:39:10,512
We had a little talk
right after you murdered him.

580
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:11,930
I'm sorry...

581
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,876
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

582
00:39:15,324 --> 00:39:18,006
and if you mean Dr. Brian Seward,

583
00:39:18,837 --> 00:39:21,128
I understand
that he committed suicide.

584
00:39:22,973 --> 00:39:26,608
You went to a lot of trouble to make it
look like a suicide. And you know what?

585
00:39:26,733 --> 00:39:27,948
You did a great job.

586
00:39:29,441 --> 00:39:31,199
The truth is, the police, the D.A.,

587
00:39:31,324 --> 00:39:33,922
they're never gonna be able
to get you for his murder.

588
00:39:34,343 --> 00:39:37,110
You're not drinking your ice tea.
Want me to order you something else?

589
00:39:37,235 --> 00:39:38,235
I'm fine.

590
00:39:38,973 --> 00:39:42,435
Anyway, put your mind at ease. The whole
murder thing, it isn't gonna happen.

591
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,256
You completely outsmarted us.

592
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:47,926
Okay?

593
00:39:48,226 --> 00:39:50,451
Anyway, that's not what you need
to be concerned about.

594
00:39:50,576 --> 00:39:53,765
What you need to be concerned about
is... now that Brian is dead, I mean...

595
00:39:54,466 --> 00:39:57,195
full-time dead, you would be shocked

596
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,975
by the things he can actually
see where he is.

597
00:40:00,257 --> 00:40:02,006
I mean, for instance,
not only did he know

598
00:40:02,131 --> 00:40:04,012
you were gonna stop
in this little diner,

599
00:40:04,228 --> 00:40:06,499
but he knew you were making
your way over the border,

600
00:40:06,624 --> 00:40:10,345
to take that $500,000 you stole
and put it in a Mexican bank.

601
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:14,533
He also knew that you had the money
in the trunk of your car...

602
00:40:14,882 --> 00:40:17,687
in cash,
under an old Indian blanket,

603
00:40:17,812 --> 00:40:21,357
and that you kept a spare key
in a magnetized box in your wheel well.

604
00:40:22,162 --> 00:40:25,380
You know, I went and had a little visit
with Brian's wife today.

605
00:40:25,681 --> 00:40:28,899
It was a pretty tricky conversation,
but it really helped to have Brian

606
00:40:29,146 --> 00:40:32,099
right there, by my side,
while I explained everything to her.

607
00:40:32,415 --> 00:40:34,818
She was really interested
in what I had to say.

608
00:40:35,372 --> 00:40:38,199
And it took a little doing,
but eventually I convinced her

609
00:40:38,324 --> 00:40:41,458
to leave Katie with the baby sitter
and take a little drive out here.

610
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:45,385
No, she's not here now.

611
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,750
That was probably her just leaving.

612
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:58,083
You know, what you're doing
is a really good thing.

613
00:40:58,992 --> 00:41:01,365
Now Brian's wife
is gonna have the money

614
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,855
to bury the father of her child.

615
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,791
She'll be able to pay off
his medical school bills,

616
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:09,613
put their little girl
through college...

617
00:41:09,988 --> 00:41:11,416
live a better life.

618
00:41:12,813 --> 00:41:14,999
If you get any ideas
about trying to get that money back,

619
00:41:15,124 --> 00:41:16,857
you should just swallow them.

620
00:41:17,258 --> 00:41:19,500
Brian wanted me
to let you know that...

621
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,184
he'll be watching you, always.
And he's got my number.

622
00:41:24,769 --> 00:41:27,576
I know you're a little tight
on cash right now, so...

623
00:41:27,972 --> 00:41:30,112
that ice tea, it's on me.
