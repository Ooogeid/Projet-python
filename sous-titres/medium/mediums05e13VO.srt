1
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,690
Well,well, look who finally
decided to wake up.

2
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,210
Joe... Where are we? Whats this place?

3
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,060
What do you mean,at iis place?

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,550
This is our bedroom.
You're in our bed.

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,440
Con,hurry up,'cause I got
to meet Terry at 10:00.

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,630
Are you wearing tennis whites?

7
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,980
Yes,I'm wearing tennis whites.
The are the rules at the club.

8
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,330
Come on. Come on. Girls got their
riding lessons in 45 minutes.

9
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,970
Joe,I don't know what's going on here.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,120
But this is not our house.

11
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,650
What are you talng about? This is
our house. Of course it's our house.

12
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,360
I'll show you the deed
if you don't believe me.

13
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,330
Damn. I know how to live.

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,920
Dad,I think the heater
in the pool's broken.

15
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,320
We have a pool?

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,340
Of course we have a pool.

17
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,030
How else would we swimming every day?

18
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,480
Are you okay Mom?

19
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,740
Yeah, I-I guess so.

20
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,820
Actually,I think I'm... I'm great.

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,420
This place is amazing.

22
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,010
It's everything we ever wanted.

23
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,290
What's back there? well,let me guess.
It's maid's quarters?

24
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,400
Hey,Allison. Allison,hey,hey,hey!
What are you doing?

25
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,950
What do you mean?
I'm checking out my house.

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,280
Okay,that's fine. But we don't
go in that room. You ow that.

27
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,130
Oh,come on,everybody.
Lighten up. It's just a room.

28
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,580
Mom,we're not allowed to go in there.

29
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,490
Not ever. That's the deal,remember?

30
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,940
Deal? What deal?

31
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,390
This is our house,isn't it?
This is our room.

32
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,410
- Allison!
- Mom!

00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,020
"Roof is to house as summit is to..."

37
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,100
- Mountain?
- Good.

38
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,750
"Composer is to melody as autr is to..."

39
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,690
- Uh,book.
- Excellent.

40
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,310
That is the dumbest
question I have ever heard.

41
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,630
What's that supposed to teach you?

42
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,420
"If you're looking for a melody,
don't look in a book?"

43
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,680
I don't t it.

44
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,910
It's an analogy.

45
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,360
It's not supposed
to teach you anything.

46
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,190
It tests your understanding of language.

47
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,420
And Daddy's helping me
get ready for the PSATs.

48
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,380
- What's that?
- It's a test.

49
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,380
Okay,and if I do well enough,that
means I might get into a good college,

50
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,240
which means I can move far away
and never see you again.

51
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,500
So,please,
leave me alone so I can practice.

52
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,650
Any chance you could take
the girls in today?

53
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,330
Lee just called me. He wants me
to meet him at Fountain Hills.

54
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,150
Yeah.

55
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,940
Hello?

56
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,920
May I speak with Allison Dubois?

57
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,060
Well,may I ask who's calling?

58
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,350
My name is Caitlyn Lynch.

59
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,320
I'm with the Lydecker Corporation.

60
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,980
I know this is going
to sound kind of out of the blue,

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,130
but I've been tracking
your career for some time now.

62
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,240
I was wondering if it might be
possible to set up a meeting withou

63
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,600
to discuss a potential
business opportunity.

64
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,830
Uh,what kind of "business opportunity"?

65
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,390
Well,I'd rely prer to discuss
that with you person.

66
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,230
I actually have an opening
in my schedule at 1:00 today.

67
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,790
Is there any possibility
we could meet for lunch?

68
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,770
Lunch today?
I don't think so. I'm working.

69
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,420
Well,I'm happy to come to you.

70
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,090
I was thinking
we could meet at Firmament.

71
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,640
Firmament?
Well,that's very nice of you,

72
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,320
but don't think I can meet you
for lunch today at Firmament.

73
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,710
Is there a day that might be better?

74
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,050
I don't think so.

75
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,320
You know,I really have to get going,uh,
Caitlyn,but thank you for thinking of me.

76
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,130
You just turned down lunch at Firmament?

77
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,580
That's the hottest place in town.

78
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,160
Who wanted to take you there?

79
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,060
I don't know. Some woman
from the Lydecker Corporation.

80
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,840
She wanted to talk to me
about a "business opportunity."

81
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,840
The Lydecker Corporation?

82
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,200
Don't they make everything?

83
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,830
Maybe you should hear
what she has to say.

84
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,000
No,I don't think so.

85
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,910
She probably read about me
in the papers last year,

86
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,570
wants to hire me for
some kind of "private reading."

87
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,680
You know I'm not really
interested in that kind of thing.

88
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,340
I don't know,for a lunch at Firmament,
maybe you could feign a little interest.

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,240
Her name's Autumn Colville.

90
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,810
She's a paralegal who works downtown.

91
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,270
Her mother reported
her missing yesterday.

92
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,480
Autumn's car is still
parked in her parking spot.

93
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,050
Her parents found groceries,still in
their bags,melting on her kitchen counter,

94
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,070
so I think it's highly likely
she was abducted from her apartment.

95
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,060
Autumn's mom said we're welcome
to do another walk-through.

96
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,220
Tell me if you can see anything.

97
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,850
Sure,of course. I just hope
I can be of some kind of help.

98
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,990
Oh,my God...

99
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,920
What's the matter?

100
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,140
Oh,the blood. And that corpse.

101
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,260
What corpse?

102
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,750
She was right there.

103
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,830
Autumn Colville.

104
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,780
She was lying right there,dead.

105
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,720
Oh,her eyes...
Someone had taken her eyes.

106
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,300
We've been through
this lace a few times;

107
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,540
there's been no idence to suggest
that kind of violence occurred here.

108
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,480
I mean,look at this place.

109
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,180
Well,I saw it.

110
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,000
Who's to say that the killer
didn't clean up after himself?

111
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,850
Well,I guess we'll get the crime scene
boys to come back,take another look.

112
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,490
Thank you.

113
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,060
T-minus 13 days and counting.
You ready?

114
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,870
I don't know.
I've been taking practice tests,

115
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,171
but I have to find a way
to go my verbal aptitude.

116
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,700
I'm thinking about asking permission
to come to school on Saturday.

117
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:54,150
Sit in an empty classroom and
just take a simulated test.

118
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,340
So I know what it's gonna feel like
on the d of the real one, you know?

119
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,890
- Seriously?
- Yeah,why not?

120
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,960
Ariel! Ashley!

121
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,250
Did you guys hear the news?

122
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,340
What news? What's going on?

123
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,150
Do you remember Stacey Anne Burrows?

124
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,310
Yeah,she transferred to Holy
Child after junior high. Why?

125
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,320
- She died yesterday.
- What?

126
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,820
Her parents got her
a car for her 16th birthday.

127
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,060
And she rolled it yesterday
on her way home from school.

128
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,380
Landed upside-down in a ravine.

129
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,710
You know what the creepiest part is?

130
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,880
The crash didn't kill her.

131
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,840
Her car filled up with
water and she drowned.

132
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,390
Allison Dubois?

133
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,840
- Do I know you?
- No.

134
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,880
But I know all about you.

135
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,650
I'm Caitlyn Lynch.
We spoke this morning.

136
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,530
Right. Hi.

137
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,000
Sorry to ambush you like this,

138
00:07:58,001 --> 00:08:01,701
but I don't know if I was able to get
my point across to you on the phone.

139
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,080
No,I think you were perfectly clear.

140
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,880
but frankly,private readings,
things like that I...

141
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:07,581
Hey wait a second.

142
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,430
Is that... Is that what you
thought I was calling about?

143
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,990
A private reading?

144
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,640
Let me,let me explain
who I am,what I do.

145
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,450
I'm what people refer
to as a "corporatentuitionist."

146
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,440
That a job title you've heard before?

147
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,150
Like you,I sense things.

148
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,510
See things,for a living.

149
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,630
But while you use your gifts
in the public sector,

150
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,250
I'm under contract to
a multinational corporation.

151
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,320
- Wait a second. You're a...
- Psychic?

152
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:42,280
Well,my official title is Executive
Vice President of Corporate Strategy.

153
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,210
But,yes,I've developed
a reputation for being...

154
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,470
sensitive to business trends.

155
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,530
The success or failure
of products in development.

156
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,660
Shifts in public appetites.

157
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,010
It's brought me a lot of money.

158
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,480
The man I work for,Mr. Lydecker,

159
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,990
is a great believer in unconventional
thinking when it comes to business.

160
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,370
He's a leader,not a follower.

161
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,570
And he and I were wondering

162
00:09:13,571 --> 00:09:17,371
if we could possibly entice you
into coming and working with us.

163
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,550
You offering me a job?

164
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,640
Well,that's...that's very flattering,

165
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:28,070
but I genuinely like what
I'm doing now,what I'm doing here.

166
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,390
And besides,I-I don't know anything
about pducts or trends or appetites.

167
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,490
Believe me,I didn't start out
dreaming about market shortfalls,

168
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:41,350
or,or impulse buys based
on psychographic data.

169
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,190
But I do now. And you will,too.

170
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,720
Think about it.

171
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,970
Obviously,we're talking about
a high six-figure salary.

172
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,470
Discuss it with your husband.

173
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,620
If ye intrigued,givee a call.

174
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,910
What did you say?

175
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,440
I didn't say anything.
I didn't really get a chance.

176
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,880
She told me to call her
if I was interested.

177
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,820
Well,you are interested,aren't you?

178
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,490
I don't know. I don't know.

179
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,470
I guess I'm intrigued.

180
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,020
That's the word
she kept using-- intrigued.

181
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,820
What exactly does it mean
when they say higsix figures?

182
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,810
It means you need toall her tomorrow.

183
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,640
You need to find out
what this is all about.

184
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:40,760
I didn't even know people like me
worked for big corporations.

185
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,900
This woman Caitlyn
said she spots trends.

186
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,410
I don't know anything about trends.

187
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,110
Come on. Don't do that.

188
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,290
Don't do what?
What am I doing?

189
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,990
You're just doing this "shucks thing".
Don't do that shucks thing.

190
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,390
Look,I'd just like
to see you acknowledge

191
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:55,991
the fact that you're
very good at what you do.

192
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,380
and an enormous corporation
has taken notice of that

193
00:10:58,381 --> 00:11:01,481
and according to this Caitlyn woman,
they're willing to pay you

194
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,630
hundreds of thousands of dollars
a year to do it for them.

195
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,720
I think you need to take this seriously.

196
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,260
I think you need to calthis woman.

197
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,790
If you don't like what
you hear,then fine.

198
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,740
But you owe it to yourself,to the kids,
to me to at least give it a listen.

199
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,950
Sir,I'm sorry to bother you.

200
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,550
Oh,hey,you must have read my mind.

201
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,550
Really,what did it say?

202
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,300
I'm sorry. You came to see me.

203
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,780
Yes,um,I need to take a little
personal time this afternoon.

204
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,260
I know it's short notice,but...

205
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,590
Nah,that's all right.

206
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,400
I have to be in court
most of the day anyway.

207
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,740
Truth is,I probably wouldn't
have even noticed you were gone

208
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,190
if you hadn't told me,
so thanks for the heads-up.

209
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,950
Yo uh,you want to walk with me?

210
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,180
So after you called me last night,

211
00:12:26,181 --> 00:12:28,781
I had the team go and dredge
beneath thrthur Bridge.

212
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,170
Scanlon just called. They found
the remains of Autumn Colville.

213
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,760
In three separate duffle bags.

214
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,980
- Oh,my God.
- That's not all.

215
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,640
There were several more
duffel bags down there.

216
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,360
When they opened them up,they found the
butchered body parts of two more girls.

217
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,360
And their eyes were missing as well.

218
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,490
Looks like we got
ourselves a serial killer.

219
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,350
Do whatever it is you need to do.
I'll find you if I need you.

220
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,620
And stop looking so guil.

221
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,630
Everybody takea little
personal time now and then.

222
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,340
My name's Allison Dubois.
I'm here to see Caitlyn Lynch.

223
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,790
<i>Thinking globally.
Ating globally.</i>

224
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,540
Allison?

225
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,780
I'm so pleased you decided to come by.

226
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,180
Maybe I could work in the lobby.

227
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,600
Well,if you're up for it,I thought
maybe you could sit in on my 2:00.

228
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,350
Get a feel for the kind of work
you'll be doing here

229
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:57,251
if you decide
to take us up on our offer.

230
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,590
That would be great.

231
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,780
Terrific. And don't look so nervous.

232
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:06,080
Like your boss said,everybody takes
a little persal time now and then.

233
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,270
Oh,my God.

234
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,650
Stacey Anne? Is that you?

235
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,050
Whereverou are,with live video
chatting on the L-Phone,

236
00:14:59,051 --> 00:15:00,751
you never have to miss a meeting.

237
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,940
Whether your traveling,
working from home,

238
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,190
or just somewhere else,
the L-Phone makes your presence felt.

239
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,610
The all-new L-Phone from Lydecker: Changing
the way we communicate one face at a time.

240
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,240
I'm sorry. I don't think it works.

241
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,990
Everything is aimed squarely at
upwardly mobile people on the go.

242
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,080
Overachievers with
a lot of disposable income.

243
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,460
But that's not who's
going to buy ts phone.

244
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,430
Well,Caitlyn,it's a $900 cell phone.

245
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:39,320
Now granted,it's a $900 cell phone
with video chat,but still,a $900 phone.

246
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,600
Who do you suggest we sell it to?

247
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,610
Or more importantly,who do
you think is going to buy it?

248
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,610
Kids.

249
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,550
I know what you're thinking.

250
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,420
Video chatting is all the ra right now.

251
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,590
Nobody even buys a computer
unless it's vid chat-capable.

252
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,060
But here's the thing.

253
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,190
Grownups are going to realize that they
don't want to be seen by other grownups

254
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,440
unless it's absolutely necessary.

255
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,870
They're not going to want
to have to put on clothes,

256
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,950
check their makeup put out the cigarette
they're not even supposed to be smoking

257
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,840
just for a simple phone nversation.

258
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:19,100
Teenagers,on the other hand,
love to be seen.

259
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:24,200
They erect virtualonuments to
themselves onocial networking sites.

260
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:28,710
This phone is for them-- not us.

261
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,870
You're sure about that?

262
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,850
Of course I'm sure,Ted.

263
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,060
I dreamt it.

264
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,680
So...

265
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,500
So,it's very impresve.

266
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,170
You're very impressive.

267
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,390
This office,the salary,
all of it,but that meeting...

268
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,220
I don't know if I could do that.

269
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,030
I do. I'm certain of it.

270
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,250
Besides,those meetings are
a relatively small part of the job.

271
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,170
Most of my work is done right here,
in this chair,actually.

272
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,320
- What do you mean?
- Please.

273
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:22,590
Twice a day I take two hours
of contemplation time.

274
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,160
Which is a fancy way of saying
that I lay in that chair,

275
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,230
shut my eyes and dream
about the future of Lydecker.

276
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,780
I'm having one made just for you.

277
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,920
Why?

278
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,270
What kind of question is that?

279
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,790
No,I appreciate your confidence.
I do.

280
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,610
I just don't understand
why this company

281
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:43,311
would want to invest in me
when they already have you.

282
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:49,110
Lydecker is a multi-national conglomerate
with branches all over the world.

283
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,190
I'm good,Allison,better than good,
but I'm still just one woman.

284
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,150
Even I can't keep track of everything.

285
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,880
That's a lot to think about.

286
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,080
I don't know what to say.

287
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,400
How about "Yes,"
and you'll start on Monday.

288
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,110
Monday?

289
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,330
I don't think I could do that.

290
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,800
I've worked for the District
Attorney's office for years.

291
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,180
I feel like I'd need
to give them some notice.

292
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,480
Allison,I respect your loyalty,

293
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:23,570
but Lydecker has just made you an offer
th will completely change your life.

294
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,180
I think it's safe to say that the company
has taken a big step in your direction.

295
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,500
If you want this job,you're going
to have to take a step towards us.

296
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,260
Sorry to interrupt,Ms. Lynch.

297
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,940
Mr. Lydecker is on the phone from Tokyo.

298
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,170
Thanks,Donald.

299
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,480
I'm sorry. I've got to take this.

300
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,200
Allison,it's a lot to digest.

301
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,970
Why don't you take until
the end of the week.

302
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:51,310
But by Friday,
I'm going to need your answer.

303
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,900
Yes?

304
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:02,110
According to my calculations,this time
next week you will be making one dollar

305
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,220
for every star that I see.

306
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,270
No,wait a second. Scratch that.

307
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,980
Make that two dollars.

308
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,510
Well,I haven't said yes yet.

309
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,520
I mean,that woman Caitlyn saidhat the
hours are gonna be long,unpredicble,

310
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,170
that I won't be able to be home as much,
pick the girls up from school anymore.

311
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,420
We can make th work.

312
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,790
How?

313
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,760
Ariel's gonna be 16 in like a minute.

314
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,980
You think if we got her a car,

315
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:32,181
she wouldn't be willing to play
chauffeur for her sisters?

316
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,590
Well,I don't know if
I wanto do that to her.

317
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,820
And what about Mr. Devalos?

318
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,500
He's probably an excellent driver,

319
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:41,201
but I doubt he'd be interested
in driving the girls.

320
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,200
He's been so good to me.

321
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,720
Because he likes you.

322
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,350
And he's gonna want this for you.

323
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,810
He's your friend,right?

324
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,200
So ask him,get his advice.

325
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,190
If you're honestly worried about how
this decision is gonna affect him,

326
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,360
I say make him a part of it.

327
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,950
Time. Time's up. Time to trade
and grade our practice tests.

328
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,130
But I didn't answer
the last five questions.

329
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,880
You're kidding me.

330
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,210
You always answer all the
questions,even if you have to guess.

331
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,490
- Hey,are you okay?
- Yeah,I'm fine.

332
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,380
You want to talk about it?

333
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,910
I really don't think you'd understand.

334
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,260
Is this about Stacey Anne?

335
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,760
I've been thinking about her a lot,too.

336
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,250
I mean...

337
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,240
we knew her,and now she's dead.

338
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,320
It's kind of a lot.

339
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,900
I tried studying last night,
and I couldn't.

340
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:12,470
No matter how rd I tried,
I couldn't get focused.

341
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,410
Can you keep a secret?

342
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,580
I used thave problems concentrating.

343
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,030
Like,I'd get worked up over stuff.

344
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,040
My doctor gave me these.

345
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,460
Paroxetine?

346
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,770
Yeah,he told my parents
I have a mild anxiety disorder.

347
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,890
I mean,I started taking those,
and now I get "A"s.

348
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,820
No one knows about this,Ariel. No one.

349
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,090
I mean,I'm only telling you
'cause you're my best friend.

350
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,830
So,do you want to try one,
see if it helps?

351
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,480
But I don't have an anxiety disorder.

352
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,900
How do you know?

353
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,940
I mean,it sounds like you have anxiety.

354
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,130
Okay. Maybe just one.

355
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:11,160
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,I'm
afraid that it gives me no pleasure at all

356
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,200
to talk to you this afternoon.

357
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,450
As you know,the defendant has served
our municipality as city controller

358
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,220
for more than 12 years now...

359
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,860
- How's it going?
- Oh,great. He's just about done.

360
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,930
The judge is gonna call
lunch recess any minute.

361
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,000
Well,I need to talk to him.

362
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,670
Will you tell him
I'll be waiting outside?

363
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:31,071
Yeah.

364
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,720
an abuse of power so flagrant,
the mayor's office itself contacted...

365
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,310
I don't want to leave. I really don't.

366
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,760
I just don't know how
I could pass this up.

367
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,910
Sir,you're not saying anything.

368
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,240
Sorry,I was thinking
about my stock portfolio.

369
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,900
I have a small position in
the Lydecker Corporation,and...

370
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:02,120
I'm thinking now might be
a good time to double it.

371
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,740
So you're saying I should take it.

372
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,850
How do you not take it?

373
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:12,030
I wish I could tempt you with a
counteroffer,but this is a city office;

374
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,620
the numbers that you're talking about,
the benefits,

375
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:17,321
the governor doesn't make that much.

376
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,870
Look,uh...

377
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:24,260
as sad as I'm gonna be
to see you go,and...

378
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:31,530
as valuable as you are,you're talking
about your family's future here. I...

379
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,790
I don't see how you can
leave that on the table.

380
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,510
They want me to start right away.

381
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,930
In fact,they're insisting
that I start on Monday. But...

382
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,720
leaving you while we're in the middle
of this whole serial killer thing,I...

383
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,320
Allison,I admire your dedication,
but believe it or not,

384
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,760
we used to catch criminals
before you came to work for us,

385
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,850
and I'm betting that we can keep
on catching 'em once you're gone.

386
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,160
But,uh...

387
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,650
damn,I'm gonna miss you.

388
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,440
I'm gonna miss you.

389
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,160
That doesn't mean I can't pick up
the phone and give you a...

390
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:15,200
a call from...
from time to time,right?

391
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,120
You better.

392
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,830
I'm home!

393
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,330
What's going on?
What's all this stuff?

394
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,280
- Hi,Mom!
- I've got presents.

395
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,600
Caitlyn Lynch and the people
at Lydecker sent them over.

396
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,430
We love Lydecker! We love Lydecker!

397
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,150
Oh,man,I hope I'm doing the right thing.

398
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:16,200
Well,if it makes you feel any better,
they certainly sent nice gifts.

399
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,310
I'm not psychic,
but I know what you're thinking.

400
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,070
Just because good things
are happening for you,

401
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,950
just because good things are happening
for us does not necessarily mean that

402
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,280
there are bad things
right around the corner.

403
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,430
It doesn't?

404
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,060
Why aren't you entitled to a nice job?

405
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,110
Working with people
who want to pay you well

406
00:25:32,111 --> 00:25:35,011
and treat you like
you're special,which you are.

407
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,560
Why? Come on.

408
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,700
You be happy for you;
I'm happy for you.

409
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:41,470
You deserve it. Now you be
happy for you. Now,come on.

410
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,020
Get up off that bed.

411
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,450
Let's round up the girls,
and let's go celebrate.

412
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,050
Yeah,I'm talking,
let's go crazy. Crazy.

413
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,400
Let's order appetizers and desserts.

414
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,430
Yeah,I'm talking...
I'm talking valet the car.

415
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,450
I don't know if I can handle this.

416
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,170
Oh,yeah,yeah,yeah.
I'm talking let's lose our minds.

417
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,280
I'm-I'm gonna throw
caution to the wind.

418
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,550
I might even... I might
even draw on the place mat.

419
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,060
Girls,your father's
starting to scare me!

420
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,110
Ooh,yeah,yeah.

421
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,480
Knock,knock.

422
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,990
Hey you have **************
to imagine surfway a guy.

423
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:46,160
see if you do can wake up a computer
imagine this guy in your dream

424
00:26:46,161 --> 00:26:47,661

of cover apartment

425
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,780
Great.Thanks.

426
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:53,870
Hey I saw your baby mom yesterday
in court, she looks great.

427
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,140
I can right prepare the day.

428
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,350
You takin ever.
So the rumor ever's true.

429
00:27:01,898 --> 00:27:04,000
So Devalos told you hein ?

430
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:07,710
I'm sorry Lee, I wanna do told you myself
I've just wanna make sure the official

431
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,930
I'm supposed to go over there and
sign some contracts this afternoon.

432
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,680
Heard they were backing up
a Brink's truck to your ple.

433
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,430
Something like that.

434
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,630
Well,I know it's not the last time
we're gonna see each other or anything,

435
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,090
but I want you to know...

436
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,730
I'm gonna miss working with you.

437
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,020
Me,too.

438
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,530
So?

439
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,220
So what?

440
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,560
The P-I-L-L,stupid.
Did it help?

441
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,950
Honestly,I kind of
forgot I even took it.

442
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,490
You're kidding me.

443
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,160
I mean,as far as I can tell,
it didn't do anything to me.

444
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,840
I didn't feel any different.

445
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:58,700
I guess I did get a lot of studying
done when I got home from school.

446
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,440
The Paroxetine totally helps.

447
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,170
I don't know. Maybe.

448
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,650
Well,did you stop
thinking about Stacey Anne?

449
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:08,220
Yeah. She didn't really give
me a reason to think about her.

450
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,030
- Uh,library after school?
- Okay.

451
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,890
Ariel Dubois.

452
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,960
You're not supposed to be
in this class until third period.

453
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,520
Sorry,Mr. Parker.
I got a little turd around.

454
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,590
I think I know where I'm going now.

455
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,940
Okay,last chance.

456
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:26,130
You know,I'm really not
the superstar you think I am.

457
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:29,350
I'm wrong almost
as often as I am right.

458
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:33,320
Allison,if you actually
bat anywhere near 500,

459
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,090
everyone here will be
deliriously happy.

460
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,840
Okay,so first order of business.

461
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:46,110
I remember reading that your insights
often come to you in your dreams.

462
00:29:46,111 --> 00:29:47,611
Is that true?

463
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,480
Well,not all the time,
but certainly a lot of

464
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:52,381
what I see comes to me in my sleep.

465
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,320
What's this?

466
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,230
That is your new file cabinet.

467
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,090
Your company hard drive.

468
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:01,030
I want you to write all your
dreams in it,all your impressions.

469
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,650
The ones that come to you at night,

470
00:30:02,651 --> 00:30:05,051
the ones that come
to you during the day.

471
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,260
I want you to log them in that book.

472
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,410
Even if you think they have
nothing to do with Lydecker,

473
00:30:09,411 --> 00:30:11,511
I want you to make a note of that.

474
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,390
You sure about "everytng"?

475
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,330
That's a lot to write down.
That's gonna be a lot to sort through.

476
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:23,500
Allison,we have just agreed to pay a small
fortune for the contents of your head.

477
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,400
We certainly don't want to miss
anything that might pass through it.

478
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,840
Oh,sorry.

479
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:34,350
Oh,it's my boss.
It's my,my other boss.

480
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,800
My,my current boss. Hello?

481
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,120
Allison,I hope I haven't
gotten you at a bad time,

482
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:44,340
but apparently Human Resources needs you
to sign some forms and surrender your IDs

483
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,980
and parking pass before I can put through
the requisition for your final paycheck,

484
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:52,570
so I just wanted to make sure you were,
in fact,coming back today.

485
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,800
Ohabsolutely. I still have people
I need to say good-bye to.

486
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,840
- Um,I should be there around 4:00.
- Fine.

487
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:03,130
Just,I probly won't see you,
so,uh,leave the pass,your keys,

488
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,650
all that stuff in your top drawer,

489
00:31:04,651 --> 00:31:07,851
and I'll leave all the things
you need to sign on your desk,okay?

490
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,670
Gotta run. Due in court.

491
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,650
Uh,bye.

492
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,890
lcomto the Lydecker Corporation,Allison.

493
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,590
I think you're going
to be very happy here.

494
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,650
Surprise!

495
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,260
Lynn's sorry she couldn't make it.
She had some doctor thing.

496
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,450
Oh,you guys have it so easy.

497
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,690
All you have to do is be born.

498
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,700
You don't have to do any of the bearing.

499
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,830
I don't want to hear it.
I didn't write the rules.

500
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:15,870
That was so great.
I had no clue,none.

501
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,710
I heard that.

502
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:20,580
It's because I'm a master party planner.

503
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,650
A master surprise party planner,
an M.S.P.P.

504
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,590
Oh,we're gonna miss you.

505
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,360
Come on. Don't be ridiculous.
You guys are my friends.

506
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,430
I'm gonna call you.
You're gonna call me.

507
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,110
Nothing's gonna change.

508
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,020
Yeah,except you're gonna
be doing really,really well.

509
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,050
You probably won't even want
to hang around your poor friends.

510
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,130
Yeah,but that's okay.

511
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,620
We'll just drive by your big,
new house,wave.

512
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,330
Give the butler notes to give to you.

513
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,430
- That's if we can get in the gate.
- Yeah.

514
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,570
Well,this is nice.

515
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:52,820
Now that I'm leaving,you guys are gonna
hook up and make a little comedy team.

516
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,140
Keep each other company.

517
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,290
She is psychic.

518
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,730
Hate to quip and run,
but I'm a busy boy.

519
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,410
I'm sorry I can't say anything
serious 'cause I can't...

520
00:33:01,411 --> 00:33:03,411
seriously believe you're going.

521
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,720
Besides that,duty calls.

522
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,290
Thanks to you and your damn dreams,

523
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,130
a couple of us detectives have
to go canvass the neighborhoods

524
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,890
around each of the victims'
apartments tonight.

525
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,250
I feel so bad for you.

526
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,380
Maybe if I go up to my new 30th-floor
office with the big windows,

527
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,840
and I'll look down
and see you canvassing.

528
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:23,590
That's it. I'm going. There's my ride.

529
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:36,060
I'd like to introduce to you to the lead
detective on the Autumn Colville case,

530
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,020
Detective Brad Auerbach.

531
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,660
The famous Allison Dubois.
It's nice to meet you.

532
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,400
Sorry to hear you're moving on.

533
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,930
We can use all the help we can get
to figure out who's killing those girls.

534
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:56,100
I'm telling you,that's the same man,
the one that I saw in my dream,

535
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:58,930
the one that I saw in
Autumn Colville's apartment.

536
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,330
Tell me you don't see it.

537
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,620
Sure,I see it. So what?

538
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,430
So what? What do you mean,"so what"?

539
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,410
Allison,you're talking about
Detective Brad Auerbach.

540
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,320
There's no way he killed those women.

541
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,850
That man's been on
the force for 20 years.

542
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,520
He's got more commendations
than I can count.

543
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:13,020
He trained me when
I got out of the academy.

544
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,570
Now,does Brad look like the guy
in this sketch? Yeah,sure.

545
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,130
Truth be told,he and I had a pretty
good laugh about it earlier today.

546
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:20,800
But if you're telling me
that's supposed to be Brad...

547
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:24,110
Lee,that is the man I saw,
and I'm sure of it.

548
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:25,730
I don't know what to say.

549
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,020
Maybe,uh,you know,maybe you had
a little too much champagne in there.

550
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,650
Maybe between that and everything
you've had on in your head this week,

551
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,250
maybe you got your wires crossed.

552
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,560
Oh,so that's it?
That's my good-bye?

553
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,140
"Maybe you got your wires crossed?"

554
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,460
What do you want me to do?

555
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,740
I'm not gonna interrogate
the senior detective on the case.

556
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,200
I can't!

557
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,990
Let's not do this. Not today.

558
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,150
You got too much to celebrate.

559
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:05,230
I got too much to do.
You go. Make lots of money.

560
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,570
I've got this from here,okay?

561
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,620
I promise. I'll let you
know how it all works out.

562
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,880
Hey,remind me: irregardless.
Word or not a word?

563
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,850
Not a word,I think.

564
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,300
Hey,Ash,can I ask you something?

565
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,330
That pill you gave me the other day?

566
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,780
It turns out you were right.
It really did help me.

567
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,260
Think you could spare any more?

568
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,930
Okay,well,he didn't listen to you.

569
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,060
Or maybe he just couldn't hear you.

570
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,430
Maybe he couldn't allow
himself to hear you.

571
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,390
On the other hand,

572
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:44,591
you gotta feel better about your
decision to leave that place,right?

573
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,180
I mean,this time next week,
if you tell the people at Lydecker

574
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:52,480
that Godzilla is gonna rise up out of the
ocean and stomp his way towards Phoenix,

575
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:55,660
they're gonna start
mobilizing the National Guard.

576
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:58,560
By next week,I'll be helping
the people at Lydecker decide

577
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:03,060
whether the cover of their annual
report should be blue or periwinkle.

578
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:07,620
But tonight,right now,
I'm worried about stopping a murderer.

579
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,370
I get it.

580
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,300
But you gotta remember,Scanlon and
Devalos are good at what they do.

581
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,540
They are. They're gonna find this guy.

582
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,920
And in the meantime,get excited.

583
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,360
Come on! You're about
to start a new job.

584
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:26,350
They're gonna be paying you money for
writing down your dreams in a book.

585
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,880
It's more money than either of us
have ever made in our entire lives.

586
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,480
I know,but what if I'm right?

587
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:35,480
What if this detective
really is the killer?

588
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,580
And how are Devalos and
Scanlon ever gonna catch him

589
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,010
when he's the one heading
up the investigation?

590
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,710
Look,you're not gonna like it,but I gotta
say,in answer to all three questions,

591
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,800
it's not your problem anymore.

592
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,910
Hey,this is Monica.

593
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:05,570
You missed me,but if you leave your name
and number,I'll call you right back.

594
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,480
You okay?

595
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,860
No,no,no,I'm fine.
I just gotta call Lee.

596
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,210
Lee? Why?

597
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,660
You don't work for those guys anymore.

598
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,440
Aren't you supposed to be writing
your dreams down in a journal

599
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,630
instead of calling people
in the middle of the night?

600
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,310
It's Scanlon.

601
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:36,520
Lee,it's me. I just had another dream.
I think it happened again. Another murder.

602
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,480
Allison...

603
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,630
I don't know where,but I know
the girl's first name was...

604
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,510
Monica. Dead girl's name is Monica Dobbs.

605
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,590
I'm standing in her house right now.

606
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,610
Her boyfriend got back
early from a business trip.

607
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,560
Came over to surprise her.

608
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,300
He's the one who found the body.

609
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,710
The scene's a mess. We think the
boyfriend probably scared the killer off

610
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,160
before he could tidy up
like he usually does.

611
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,870
You need to find Detective Auerbach.

612
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,760
You need to bring him in right away.

613
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:00,370
- It wasn't him,Allison.
- You don't know that!

614
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,940
Actually,I do.

615
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:06,100
I've been with him all night since the
moment we left your party until right now.

616
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,100
And the medical examiner tells us the
girl was killed about 90 minutes ago,

617
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:13,450
so I don't know what you think you
saw in your dream,but you're wrong.

618
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,020
Brad Auerbach didn't do this.
He didn't do any of it.

619
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,340
He couldn't have.

620
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,670
Good morning. May I help you?

621
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,460
Yes. My name is Allison Dubois.
I'm a new employee.

622
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:40,880
I was hoping that you'd have
directions and a pass here for me.

623
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,750
Allison?

624
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,660
I had a feeling you'd be
getting here about this time.

625
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,580
I thought I'd welcome you in person.

626
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,430
Are you excited about your first day?

627
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,520
I'm excited. I'm nervous.

628
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,410
I'm terrified.

629
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,250
I can completely relate.
I was all of the above.

630
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,950
Come on. Let's get started.

631
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,080
We have a meeting with
Mr. Lydecker at 10:00.

632
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,380
- The Mr. Lydecker?
- The one and only.

633
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,650
He doesn't bite.

634
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,700
Not unless he's really hungry.

635
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,020
No,I know,I know.

636
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,850
I just didn't expect
to meet him on the first day.

637
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,680
Guess who works here.

638
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,890
Someone else who has
the same name as me?

639
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,860
Go on in.

640
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,730
Yeah. Takes your breath away,doesn't it?

641
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:46,320
- What's wrong? You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah. No,I'm fine.

642
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,060
I just had a bad dream
about the new job.

643
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,250
It's the first-day jitters,I guess.

644
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,330
Well,don't worry about it.

645
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,790
- This time tomorrow,it'll be...
- This time tomorrow.

646
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,430
Thanks for that.

647
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,780
That's what I'm here for.

648
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,270
I just don't want to look out of place.

649
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:11,460
Well,I've never been to the place,
so I can't be of any help in that regard.

650
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:14,440
But I like... that one.

651
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,690
No,no,no. I have a bad
feeling about that one.

652
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,520
About a suit?

653
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,040
I just... I want to make
a good first impression.

654
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,540
Well,these people came after you.

655
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,190
You have met the burden of
a first impression and conquered it.

656
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:31,320
Mom,there's a big black
car in our driveway.

657
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,560
The limo's already here,
and I'm not even dressed.

658
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:37,490
Is that a limo? What's going on?

659
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,990
Did Mommy get famous and
someone forget to tell us?

660
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,660
No,no,no,honey. Nobody got famous.

661
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,190
Mommy just got a new car
with her new job.

662
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,570
They're picking me up this morning,

663
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:49,271
so I'm able to drive the new car
home this evening.

664
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,860
Cool.

665
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:54,770
Wait,can we take the limo to school
and make all the other kids jealous?

666
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,120
Bridgette.

667
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,420
Well,can I at least go outside
and take pictures of it?

668
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,880
You know what? You're going to have
to handle this. I don't have time.

669
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,380
Yep? Allison?

670
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,950
I just needed to be reassured
at God doesn't smite people

671
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,010
who ride to work in big black
limousines with handsome drivers

672
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:20,860
who offer you hot coffee and
your choice of newspapers.

673
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,550
I can't. God does.

674
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,760
But I hear they're all
smiling when the end does come.

675
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,510
So,uh,they're treating you well,huh?

676
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:34,180
Well,I really haven't started yet,but
"well" doesn't even begin to describe it.

677
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,600
Do you want to hear the nutty part?

678
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,910
I miss City Hall.

679
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:44,200
Allison,it's early Monday morning.
No one's even here yet.

680
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,210
There's nothing to have missed.

681
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,190
You know,just before the weekend,
I had kind of a crazy hunch.

682
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,540
Detective Scanlon didn't happen
to mention it to you,did he?

683
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,430
It involved Detective Auerbach.

684
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,310
No. But I've got Lee standing
in my doorway right now.

685
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,210
Is there something
you want me to ask him?

686
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,270
It's Allison Dubois calling from
her chauffeured limousine

687
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:05,071
to say hi to the little people.

688
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,550
Oh,yeah. Dubois.
Which one was she?

689
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,580
All right. Never mind.

690
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:13,630
Allison. Forget about this case.
Start your new job.

691
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,560
Make a lot of money.
I may need to borrow some.

692
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:18,070
Yeah,me,too. You were
always my favorite,Allison.

693
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,290
Good morning. May I help you?

694
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,980
Allison!

695
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,570
I had a feeling you'd be
getting here about this time.

696
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,250
I thought I'd welcome you in person.

697
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,100
Excited about your first day?

698
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:51,600
Guess who works here.

699
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,250
Someone else with the same name as me?

700
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,190
Go on in.

701
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:00,910
Please. You do the honors.

702
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:11,010
Yeah. Takes your breath away,
doesn't it?

703
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,570
It's amazing.

704
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,760
I'm glad you like it.

705
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,760
You're going to be spending
a lot of time in here.

706
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,630
I'm going to be forwarding you
a lot of material,

707
00:43:27,631 --> 00:43:30,231
and I want your impression
on all of it.

708
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,600
As far as how you get those impressions,
well,if you need to kick off your shoes,

709
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:39,220
stretch out on your chair,
let your mind wander...

710
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,800
It's all part of the job.

711
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:43,090
What,napping's part
of my job description?

712
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,720
I call it "contemplation time."

713
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:48,950
It keeps the other people
around here from getting jealous.

714
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,400
But,to answer your question,yes.
Naps are cool.

715
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:58,870
As long as you keep an accurate log of
everything you see and pass it on to me.

716
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,520
There is one other thing that
I think we should take care of today

717
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:06,100
after our meeting with Mr. Lydecker.

718
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:10,980
How about you and I go
on a little shopping trip?

719
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:13,990
Shopping?

720
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:19,660
I don't pretend to understand
exactly what it is that Caitlyn does,

721
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:23,150
but I am pragmatic enough
to see that it works.

722
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,930
And now I found you,Allison.

723
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,660
Caitlyn tells me you have quite a gift.

724
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:33,000
Yes. That's what
she keeps telling me,too.

725
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:36,610
I will try to not you down

726
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,810
no u won't.

727
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,170
Because I have enormous
confidence in you.

728
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:47,630
This corporation thrives
because we excel at two things:

729
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:51,270
innovation and secrecy.

730
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,980
We breed the next generation of ideas.

731
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,640
And then we manage and
we cultivate those ideas,

732
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:02,020
confident that our competitors
have no clue what we're up to.

733
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:06,720
So,naturally,that creates a lot
of temptation for our employees.

734
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:09,210
It would be very easy for
someone to supplement their income

735
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:14,770
by leaking company secrets to
the press or to one of our competitors.

736
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:18,520
These our employee dossiers.

737
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:20,970
I'd like you to spend
some time with them.

738
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:25,820
See if there's anyone among
this group that gives you pause.

739
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,570
I'd be very anxious
to hear what you have to say.

740
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,700
Ariel,I don't believe it.
You got a perfect score. In math.

741
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:50,640
I didn't even think that was possible.

742
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,380
It was just a practice test.

743
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:54,440
Still,I hate you.

744
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:57,660
It's your fault,you know.
It's those pills.

745
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:00,670
I don't know. I look the pills,
too,and I only got a 488.

746
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:06,670
No,I mean,without those pills,
there's no way I'd be able to do this.

747
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,280
There's no way I'd be able
to focus or concentrate.

748
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,410
That reminds me...

749
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,690
I'm going to need some more.

750
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,910
Look,I don't think I can.

751
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,940
I just gave you a bunch. I don't
refill my prescription till next week.

752
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,080
How about just one?

753
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,340
I don't have one.

754
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,100
You know my father counts these.

755
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,130
Stop looking at me like that.

756
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,930
You're forgetting
I actually need this stuff.

757
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,790
I don't get it.

758
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,980
I thought this was about you
being upset over Stacey Anne.

759
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,500
You're not still upset
about her,are you?

760
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:56,550
Look,all right,
but I can only give you two more.

761
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,950
This is the last time,seriously.

762
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,670
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

763
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,450
Okay,I give up.

764
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,820
I'm sorry? Did you say something?

765
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:46,650
I said,"I give up," trying to figure out
what's going on in that brain of yours.

766
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:48,970
I can't read your expression.

767
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:51,780
Well,my expression,that's,uh...

768
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:55,070
Exhaustion. And amazement.

769
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:57,920
This has been an incredible day.

770
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,270
You're happy?

771
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,630
No,I'm miserable.

772
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:04,570
You're buying me clothes,
buying me a car.

773
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:07,360
I get to meet Mr. Lydecker...

774
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,090
He's pretty impressive,isn't he?

775
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:13,430
He's one of the most charismatic,
uh,intimidating,fascinating...

776
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:15,620
Tell me about it.

777
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,860
You know,I saw him cry.

778
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,590
I'm sorry?

779
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:25,180
Well,we were sitting in
his office and I had a...

780
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:27,920
I mean,he was just sobbing.

781
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:30,530
It was as if someone had died.

782
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,080
Have you ever seen anything like that?

783
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:38,780
I've worked for the man
for almost a decade,and no.

784
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,540
You must be very good.

785
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:49,560
I think that this is one insight that
you should probably keep out of your log.

786
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:53,420
Yes,of course.

787
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,200
- See anything?
- Nope.

788
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,300
Yep.

789
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:08,250
Dad! Ariel! I think she's coming!

790
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:13,630
Can I borrow it?

791
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,330
Hey,ask me how my first day was.

792
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:25,480
You're smiling.

793
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:27,300
I'm sorry. Did you say something?

794
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,700
I said,"You're smiling."

795
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,270
Oh,I guess I am.

796
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,400
I actually had a pretty wonderful day.

797
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,060
I can't believe
I hesitated to take this job.

798
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:42,530
Everyone there is so nice.

799
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:46,690
I mean,not that everybody at the district
attorney's office isn't nice,but...

800
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:52,590
It's kind of refreshing not
to ponder death and evil every day.

801
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:04,340
So what now?

802
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:09,040
Dreams of new products and
profit and loss statements?

803
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,370
We can only hope.

804
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:15,250
We can only hope.

805
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,710
<i>750 Wick Ave APT B</i>

806
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:15,170
<i>Sleep tight</i>

807
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,420
I saw it,Lee.

808
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:00,560
Someone texted him the address
of Autumn Colville's apartment.

809
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,780
But he didn't kill her.

810
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:03,760
He just cleaned up after whoever did.

811
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:05,820
You sound like what
I'm saying is absurd.

812
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,670
I know. There's a reason for that.

813
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,700
Allison,why would Brad Auerbach,

814
00:52:09,701 --> 00:52:12,301
the guy who's heading up the task
force to catch this butcher,

815
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:13,730
drive out in the middle of the night

816
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:17,131
and cut up bodies into easily
disposable pieces for him?

817
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,120
Doesn't make sense.

818
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:20,880
I don't know,maybe he knows the killer
and he's trying to protect him.

819
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:22,780
Maybe he's getting paid for it.

820
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:24,770
What difference does it make,Lee?

821
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,550
He's doing it.

822
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,830
No. Sorry.

823
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,650
You're talking about Brad Auerbach.

824
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,810
You're talking about a fellow detective.

825
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:35,050
Okay,look,I get it.

826
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:38,051
You respect the guy.
And-and maybe I'm crazy.

827
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,120
But there has got to be a way

828
00:52:40,121 --> 00:52:42,621
that you can look into this without
setting off alarms,

829
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:44,890
without embarrassing yourself.

830
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,310
If you could just ask him about the bag.

831
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:52,730
There,there was this case that
he was using,this big,rolling black bag.

832
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,520
He put all his tools in it,
everything he needed to clean up.

833
00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:00,000
It was like a,a salesman's case.

834
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:04,070
Or don't.

835
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:06,980
- Say hi to Lynn.
- Don't do that.

836
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,710
A big,black case. I'll try.

837
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,250
Thank you.

838
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:22,970
Hello?

839
00:53:22,971 --> 00:53:26,371
Joe,hi. This is Bill Whitaker,
Ashley's dad.

840
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:29,430
Uh,we met at one of those,
uh,parent-teacher tngs.

841
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:31,250
Do you have a minute?

842
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,390
And this is the only employee
that you're worried about?

843
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:37,320
Well,he's really the only
person who jumped out at me.

844
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:41,030
I mean,he's the only person
I had a strong response to.

845
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,730
A strong negative response.

846
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:47,200
It's... it's hard to put into words.

847
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:51,570
So there's nothing specific,
nothing that you can...

848
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,200
put your finger on. Just...

849
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:58,010
Just a kind of darkness.
Towards the company. Towards you.

850
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,790
I'm sorry. I wish I had more to offer.

851
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,450
I really don't even know
what he es for the company.

852
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,680
Most of the information in his file
was blacked out with a marker.

853
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,880
That's quite all right.

854
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:16,340
I'm very familiar with
this particular employee.

855
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:18,650
I appreciate your input.

856
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:21,870
I'll handle this matter personally.

857
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:24,710
When Mr. Lydecker says he's going
to handle something personally,

858
00:54:24,711 --> 00:54:25,811
what does that mean?

859
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,030
What does it mean?

860
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:30,360
It means that if he suspects
someone of being dislol,

861
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:35,060
that person usually find themselves
being transferred off of our key projects.

862
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,580
Basically,they're benched
until their contract runs out.

863
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:42,040
Usually,they get the message
before then and move on.

864
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:46,330
So if I share my impressions about
someone,I could ruin their career?

865
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:49,170
Are you worried about
that kid you pointed out?

866
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:52,350
Relax. Nothing's going to happen to him.

867
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:55,450
He's kind of a... special case.

868
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:59,600
He's Justin Lydecker.
Mr. Lydecker's son.

869
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:02,480
Oh,my God. I just accused
the CEO's son of,of...

870
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:05,640
Being exactly who he is.

871
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:07,530
Trust me,Allison.

872
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:11,000
You are not the first person
to point out that Justin Lydecker

873
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,440
is never going to become
the employee of the month.

874
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:20,860
He's kind of a running joke around here,the
poster boy for just say yes to anything.

875
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,110
Drugs,clubbing...

876
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,460
Lots of days Justin doesn't even
bother to show up around here.

877
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:30,330
I don't know why Mr. Lydecker
even bothers to keep him around.

878
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:34,660
I know he used to think that one day
maybe Justin would take over for him.

879
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,400
Now,I think he prays
that kid lives to see 30.

880
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:40,910
Mrs. Dubois? Your husband
called several times.

881
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,620
He said he needs to speak
with you as soon as possible.

882
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,420
Thank you. Excuse me.

883
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:03,060
Aren't you guys
supposed to be at work?

884
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:06,230
I got a call from
Ashley's father today.

885
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:07,970
He's convinced that
his daughter is sharing

886
00:56:07,971 --> 00:56:10,171
 her antianxiety medication with you.

887
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:12,970
Tell us this isn't true.

888
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,820
Or that there's some aspect
of it that we don't understand.

889
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,010
It's complicated.

890
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:23,290
I'll bet it is.

891
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:26,840
It wasn't for fun or anything.

892
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,820
There was nothing fun about it.

893
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:31,750
I just...

894
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,750
the PSATs are coming up,and...

895
00:56:33,751 --> 00:56:35,951
there's this girl and
she won't leave me alone,

896
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:38,850
and she won't let me
study or concentrate...

897
00:56:38,851 --> 00:56:40,151
Wait a second. Hold on.
Hold on. What girl?

898
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,650
Stacey Anne Burrows.

899
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:46,930
Okay,so you took drugs?
That makes no sense.

900
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:49,770
Not drugs.

901
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:53,290
It's like you said.
It's Ashley's prescription.

902
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,640
And she takes it so she can concentrate.

903
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:58,610
And that's why I took it,and it worked.

904
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:01,950
She left me alone.

905
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,110
Stacy Anne just...

906
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:15,870
Wha... wha-what am I missing?

907
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:24,060
Stacey Anne... is she dead?

908
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:38,650
I was 14 when I first started stealing
beers to push the voices down

909
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,890
to keep the ghosts away.

910
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,720
I hate this.

911
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,220
I already lived through this once.

912
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,530
Why does she have to live through it?

913
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,140
I want to be smart about this.

914
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:53,700
We need to be smart about this.

915
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:55,660
Of course.

916
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,300
Lee?

917
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,590
Jeez,buddy. What the hell are
you doing here at this hour?

918
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,930
It's a good thing I got
a change of underwear inside.

919
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,700
New development in the case.

920
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:35,660
I was in the area,knew you
were just getting off detail...

921
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,340
Thought I'd take a shot.

922
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,000
At 2:00 in the morning?

923
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:41,160
You sure you weren't waiting for me?

924
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,990
It seems like maybe
you were waiting for me.

925
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,550
Yeah,well,I guess maybe I was.

926
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,010
Maybe I was waiting for you.

927
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:54,330
All right,so what's the big break?

928
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:57,810
Turns out it's a team. Two guys.

929
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:00,690
One guy does the deed.

930
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,800
The other,he comes in after the fact,
gets rid of the body,cleans up.

931
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:06,660
Knows what he's doing,too.

932
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:09,150
Leaves the place forensically spotless.

933
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,390
Okay.

934
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:13,440
And where'd you get this?

935
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:15,460
I mean who are you talking
to that I'm not talking to ?

936
00:59:15,461 --> 00:59:17,161
Why? You want a name?

937
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:19,960
Yeah. I want a name.

938
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,260
I want to talk to the guy,'cause
I got to say,that doesn't sound right.

939
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:27,610
I mean,I've heard of serial
killers working in pairs before.

940
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:33,930
You know,like thrill-killers taking turns,
but nothing like what you're describing.

941
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:40,010
No,it doesn't make sense. I mean,
what's in it for the guy who cleans?

942
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,100
I don't know. Money maybe.

943
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:45,390
Maybe the guy doesn't make that much.

944
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,890
Maybe the guy's a cop.

945
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,130
Well,that's nuts.

946
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:58,020
Yeah,well,the thing is,
I need to look in that case,Brad.

947
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,320
Me? You think it's me?

948
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:07,240
I think I need to look in that case.

949
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:13,630
What are you doing,man?
Have you lost your mind?

950
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:16,590
It's me. It's Brad.

951
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:19,160
Well,then the case doesn't matter.

952
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:25,340
Fine.

953
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,780
I'm not a good forgetter,Lee.

954
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:34,680
Just so you know,when this is over,
I'm not a good forgetter.

955
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,770
- Yeah?
- Lee,it's Allison.

956
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,190
Are you all right?

957
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:48,780
Yeah. Yeah,I'm fine.

958
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:51,350
My God,I just had
the most horrible dream.

959
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:55,030
Detective Auerbach shot you.

960
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:57,860
Yeah,well,not to worry.
Your dream was wrong.

961
01:00:57,870 --> 01:01:00,620
Detective Auerbach didn't kill me.

962
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:03,850
I killed him.

963
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:19,130
You okay?

964
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:22,110
I don't know.
Manny's gonna tell us in a minute.

965
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,480
He's been on the phone for an hour.

966
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:28,120
The governor,
the chief of police,forensics.

967
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:29,930
You're still shaking.

968
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:31,600
No,I'm fine.

969
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,330
Good news.

970
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,240
Forensics just finished it's
preliminary analysis on the items

971
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:40,000
from that black case
in Auerbach's garage.

972
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:44,260
For starters,there was a power saw with
traces of skin,blood,and bone on the blade.

973
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:47,580
Obviously,we still need to make
a DNA match with the victims,

974
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:51,660
but,um,from the sound of it,
I think you're going to be okay.

975
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:54,000
Maybe even better than okay.

976
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:57,990
Everybody's on board: the mayor,
the governor,the chief of police.

977
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,070
You're a hero,Lee.

978
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,630
The guy drew on me. I'm no hero.

979
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,450
Sorry it took me so long to hear you.

980
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,550
It's okay.
I'm just happy you're alive.

981
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:11,900
We're all just happy that you're alive.

982
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,650
Doesn't seem fair.

983
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:17,130
We can review Brad's bank statements,
check out his phone logs,

984
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:21,620
see if we can figure out who his sick
partner is,but if nothing shakes loose...

985
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:22,920
I didn't just kill a bad cop.

986
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:28,000
I shot the only guy on the planet who
can definitely tell us who our killer is.

987
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,420
You scared me.

988
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:46,210
Sorry.

989
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:49,800
I was out most of the night.

990
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:51,590
Stuff from my old job.

991
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:55,430
When I finally got back here,
I couldn't get to sleep.

992
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:59,120
I just kept thinking...

993
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:01,530
thinking about you.

994
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:06,150
Hey,I want you to go to the doctor.

995
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:10,260
But it has to be somebody who
knows about me... about how I am.

996
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:14,040
Hopefully have some kind of
sympathy for how difficult it can be.

997
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:20,530
I don't think I get what you're saying.

998
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:25,660
I did a little research on
that medicine you were taking.

999
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:29,260
It's pretty common.

1000
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:31,590
A lot of people take it.

1001
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:34,580
The Web site says that...

1002
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:37,860
the side effects are very minimal.

1003
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:40,670
Only...

1004
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:46,980
I started wondering what high
school would have been like for me

1005
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:51,030
if I had a drug like that,
people to talk to.

1006
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:58,490
What?

1007
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:02,960
I'm awake,right?

1008
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:07,610
Hey,I still think what you did
was incredibly reckless.

1009
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:11,610
Incredibly dangerous.

1010
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:14,230
You can never do that again.

1011
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:19,770
And part of me cannot even believe
that we're having this conversation.

1012
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:25,370
But Daddy and I talked.

1013
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,140
And...

1014
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:34,050
if the doctor thinks that medication
will improve the quality of your life...

1015
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:38,060
Mom,can I ask you something?

1016
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:41,500
If you can't get me
an appointment right away,

1017
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:44,930
can I just use the rest of Ashley's
pills just to get me through the test?

1018
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:50,930
No. Honey,we promised we would give
those pills back to Ashley's parents.

1019
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:56,640
And until a doctor tells us that there's
a medicine that makes sense for you...

1020
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:03,760
But I promise that I will try to get
that appointment as soon as possible.

1021
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:09,550
And until then,well,
I'm a good listener.

1022
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:16,500
So do you want early breakfast,or do
you want to sleep another 30 minutes?

1023
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:18,240
Sleep.

1024
01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:20,450
Okay.

1025
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,310
Mom.

1026
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:33,110
Shove over.

1027
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,920
When did you realize he was my son?

1028
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:03,240
Caitlyn told me.

1029
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:11,160
Why do you look so frightened?

1030
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:13,450
Do I look frightened?

1031
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,970
Yes,you look terrified.

1032
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,520
And why are you standing by the door?

1033
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,880
Come into the room. Have a seat.

1034
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:32,090
I went to see Justin yesterday.

1035
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:35,520
I told him I had some
concerns about his lifestyle.

1036
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,410
It's nothing I haven't said
to him before.

1037
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:41,030
Usually he ignores me.

1038
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:43,910
But this time he insisted
that I was wrong.

1039
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:47,020
Says that he's finally ready
to become a grown-up.

1040
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:50,180
Take some responsibility for his life...

1041
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:52,280
his work.

1042
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:56,990
I was wondering if you'd mind
meeting with him.

1043
01:06:57,010 --> 01:07:00,130
I'd be very curious
to hear your impressions.

1044
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:03,440
See if you think that he has
actually turned a corner in his life.

1045
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:14,220
So,this is exciting.

1046
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:17,840
I'm one of the first people in the
company to get a look at my dad's new toy.

1047
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:21,560
I don't think your father
thinks of me as a toy.

1048
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,190
No,I know.

1049
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:26,360
But you should realize that
you are now officially topic #1

1050
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:29,530
around the water
cooler here at Lydecker.

1051
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:36,090
Everybody knows you do the same thing
that Caitlyn does,and honestly,

1052
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:38,860
I think they're
a little surprised that...

1053
01:07:38,861 --> 01:07:41,561
my dad would bring
in another six-figure napper.

1054
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:46,590
There's far more to my job
than taking naps.

1055
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:50,470
Your father is interested
in my impressions of things...

1056
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,700
people,which is why I think he
wanted me to sit down with you.

1057
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:55,520
Yeah. That's what I figured.

1058
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:57,590
He wants you to tell him
if his only son is

1059
01:07:57,591 --> 01:07:59,791
permanently screwed up
or if I can be...

1060
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:01,660
salvaged.

1061
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,020
That's not exactly the way he put it.

1062
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:07,880
No,but that is what he wants to know.

1063
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:11,180
And honestly,
I can't really blame him.

1064
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:14,610
I've spent most of the last
decade disappointing the man.

1065
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:19,300
DUIs,assault charges,
all those stints in rehab.

1066
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:19,930
I mean,it's...

1067
01:08:19,931 --> 01:08:24,131
it's hardly a secret that I've been
a total disaster for a long time.

1068
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:34,350
Look... I know that my dad
doesn't trust me.

1069
01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:37,450
I can't blame him.

1070
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:39,070
But I'm 26 years old,

1071
01:08:39,071 --> 01:08:43,271
and my greatest accomplishment
in life is-is sleeping with a girl

1072
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:47,070
who came in second place
on a reality show.

1073
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:54,360
I guess I'm just tired of being a joke.

1074
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:58,590
And all that dark stuff is in the past.

1075
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:01,620
And I want to change.

1076
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,750
I have changed.

1077
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:33,530
Look,I have to be honest with you.

1078
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:36,980
I don't really believe in what you do.

1079
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:41,470
But I know that my dad does.

1080
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:43,600
So please...

1081
01:09:43,601 --> 01:09:47,901
I'd really appreciate it if you'd tell him
that his prodigal son is doing just fine.

1082
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,530
I remember you.

1083
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:14,940
You hungry?

1084
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:19,530
That would involve chewing and I don't
think I have the strength for that.

1085
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,800
Where is everybody?

1086
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:25,070
They're asleep.
It's after 10:00,sweetie.

1087
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:27,150
Great.

1088
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:29,330
Suicide?

1089
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:35,200
I kept leaving messages for Mr. Lydecker,
explaining that it was urgent.

1090
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:36,140
He never called back.

1091
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:41,310
Then I tried to tell Caitlyn,
but she was with him behind closed doors.

1092
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,830
I just feel like crying.

1093
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:49,180
I mean,that boy...

1094
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:54,440
That boy must have had every
possible advantage in life.

1095
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,430
And even with that,he's so unhappy.

1096
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:01,090
He's ready to stick a gun
in his mouth and pull the trigger.

1097
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:05,870
How does that happen?

1098
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:09,770
I don't know. I've been
asking myself that for hours.

1099
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:12,270
What didn't he get?

1100
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:14,390
What didn't his father give him?

1101
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:15,900
Time,maybe?

1102
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:19,630
Was he too busy building
an empire to be a good father?

1103
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:23,080
And the punch line is...

1104
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:30,360
I come home from work and I miss dinner
again and my girls are already asleep.

1105
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:32,410
Oh,come on.
I don't think it's the same thing.

1106
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:34,660
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1107
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:38,340
I hope you're right.

1108
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:43,020
Take one test booklet
and pass the others back.

1109
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:48,590
You will have 25 minutes
for part one of the exam.

1110
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:53,670
Before you begin,be sure to complete
the personal information in section A.

1111
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:57,870
Please be sure that you fill
in all of the ovals completely.

1112
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,800
You should be using a #2 pencil.

1113
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:04,260
If your pencil breaks,
I have extras here at my desk.

1114
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:07,470
Please raise your hand and
you may come up to get one.

1115
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:14,970
Eyes on your own paper,please.

1116
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:22,390
Abraham Lincoln was
America's greatest president.

1117
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:24,470
Check your spelling on "president."

1118
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:27,010
I think you've got a couple of
extra Es kicking around in there.

1119
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:29,130
Okay,Daddy.

1120
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:31,730
Lincoln's mother died in infancy.

1121
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,120
And he was born in a log cabin,
which he built.

1122
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:37,550
You might want to check
your facts on that.

1123
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:41,460
If Lincoln's mom died when she was
an infant,there would be no Lincoln.

1124
01:12:41,470 --> 01:12:44,930
Nope. I think you're wrong about that.
That's what our teacher told us.

1125
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:47,340
Yeah,I heard that,too.

1126
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:50,470
Uh,Dad? Where's Mom?

1127
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:53,650
Uh,I don't know,sweetie.
She had to go in extra early today.

1128
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:57,120
Is something wrong?

1129
01:12:57,130 --> 01:13:00,570
Do you think there's any way that you
could get me in to see the doctor today?

1130
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,260
Today? Uh,I don't think so,honey.

1131
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:06,700
Um,the doctor that Mom has in mind is
out of town till the end of the week.

1132
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:07,660
Why? What's going on?

1133
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:11,290
Just... I had this dream,
this crazy dream.

1134
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,830
Okay.

1135
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:16,420
Well,you know,bad dreams are really
your mom's area of expertise. But,uh...

1136
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:18,630
It's okay. It's probably nothing.

1137
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,730
It's not like it even
made a lot of sense.

1138
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:22,720
I just... I was taking the PSATs,

1139
01:13:22,721 --> 01:13:25,221
and I was in a classroom
that I'd never been in before,

1140
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:27,350
and the teacher was giving the exam.

1141
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:30,100
I'd never seen her,either,and...

1142
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:32,720
It's,uh,it's probably nothing.

1143
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:35,210
Are you sure? Because maybe
I could reach Mom on the phone.

1144
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:37,030
We could figure something out.

1145
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:40,510
No,it's okay. Thanks.

1146
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,860
- Did you hear?
- What?

1147
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:50,170
Okay,apparently,Mr. Rutherford
has some radical stomach virus.

1148
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,290
What do you mean?

1149
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:53,420
He was in first period,
going on about Charlemagne,

1150
01:13:53,421 --> 01:13:55,921
and then he just
pukes all over the place.

1151
01:13:55,950 --> 01:13:59,770
Like,geyser-style,on his desk,
his chair,his shoes...

1152
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:02,130
His classroom is a biohazard.

1153
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,890
There's a note on e door that
we have to go to some room

1154
01:14:03,891 --> 01:14:06,191
in the auxiliary
building for second period.

1155
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:07,860
Wait. It gets better.

1156
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:10,420
Some student teacher is
taking over his class for him,

1157
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:13,180
which probably means she'll make
the whole class into a study hall.

1158
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:16,730
So I'm betting we can squeeze
in another practice test.

1159
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:22,900
- Oh,my God.
- What?

1160
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:26,050
There's something
familiar about this room.

1161
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:29,080
Okay. Everyone,let's settle down.

1162
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:38,930
Please. Take a seat.

1163
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:44,970
As most of you probably already know,
Mr. Rutherford went home sick.

1164
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:46,730
My name is Ms. Snowden.

1165
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:49,530
I'll be your teacher until
he gets back on his feet.

1166
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:52,720
Authorities continue to investigate
a possible connection

1167
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:55,421
between slain police detective
Brad Auerbach

1168
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:58,850
and the recent string of serial
killings in the Phoenix area.

1169
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:03,190
So far,they're refusing to confirm
whether they consider Auerbach a suspect

1170
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:04,810
or just person of
interest in this case...

1171
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:07,090
Mr. Lydecker? I'm sorry.

1172
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:09,540
Your assistant told me
to come right in.

1173
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:13,950
Thank you.

1174
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:19,040
You left me a number of urgent messages.

1175
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:21,940
Sir,I'm concerned about your son.

1176
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:25,930
I sense that he's in
a real moment of crisis.

1177
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:29,470
He's consumed by
a profound sense of despair.

1178
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:32,620
And I'm fairly certain
he's going to attempt to hurt himself.

1179
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:35,640
I appreciate your concern.

1180
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:38,550
And I've sensed the same thing myself.

1181
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:41,990
Now,rest assured,he's being watched.

1182
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:46,190
I've reached out to a number
of mental health professionals.

1183
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:49,780
Truth be told,at this moment,

1184
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:53,360
I am less concerned about Justin's
well-being than I am with yours.

1185
01:15:55,310 --> 01:16:00,980
Caitlyn and I have been
reviewing your log,your dreams,

1186
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:03,550
your impressions.

1187
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:07,460
I fear we may have a problem,Allison.

1188
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:09,260
Really? I'm sorry.

1189
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:13,000
The dreams you've been having about
this,uh,this police detective...

1190
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:14,090
the one who just died,

1191
01:16:14,091 --> 01:16:16,891
the one that you believe is connected
to this recent spate of murders?

1192
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:18,550
Can I ask you about those?

1193
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:19,810
Please.

1194
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:23,470
The fact that he was slain
by a former colleague of yours

1195
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,200
the night after you dreamed

1196
01:16:25,201 --> 01:16:28,001
that he was connected to
this horrible string of murders.

1197
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:32,040
I suspect that that's not a coincidence.

1198
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:34,900
I'm not following where you're going...

1199
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:37,610
Did you mention your dreams
to your colleague?

1200
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:41,450
Yes,I did.

1201
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:46,440
Okay,well,I understand
that you're new here.

1202
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:48,830
I understand that you're...

1203
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:51,350
You are still finding your footing.

1204
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:55,800
But I need to be completely
clear about one thing.

1205
01:16:57,450 --> 01:17:01,880
We are paying you
an extremely large sum of money.

1206
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:07,870
Your thoughts,your
dreams,your impressions...

1207
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:11,290
they belong to Lydecker now.

1208
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:16,200
They are actually the intellectual
property of this company,

1209
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:20,860
so any attempt on your part to share those
thoughts,those dreams,those impressions,

1210
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:26,480
with anyone outside of this company
would actually constitute an act of theft.

1211
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:31,250
And I would hate
to have to prosecute you.

1212
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,670
Sir,I take your point,

1213
01:17:32,671 --> 01:17:35,671
but the dreams that we're talking
about have nothing to do with Lydecker,

1214
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:38,370
and everything to do with
an open police investigation

1215
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:41,870
in which lives clearly
hang in the balance.

1216
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:44,240
Certainly,you can
appreciate that distinction.

1217
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:45,990
Yeah,of course I do.

1218
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:50,780
And I do appreciate your sense
of civic responsibility. However...

1219
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:55,950
If you ever breach your contract again,

1220
01:17:55,990 --> 01:18:00,440
if you ever breach my confidence again,

1221
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:02,100
I will litigate you

1222
01:18:02,101 --> 01:18:06,901
with a vigor unlike anything you have
ever experienced in your life.

1223
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:11,950
I will see to it that between
the cost of defending yourself

1224
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:14,850
and the time it takes
to mount that defense,

1225
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:18,030
both you and your husband
will be absolutely penniless.

1226
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:22,970
Your house will be gone.
Your children will have no futures.

1227
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:26,870
Don't misunderstand,Allison.

1228
01:18:26,890 --> 01:18:31,590
It's my expectation that you will
work here for a very long time.

1229
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:35,550
Maybe the rest of your life.
I want you to be happy.

1230
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:42,150
I want us both to be happy.

1231
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:04,460
How long are you going to sit out here?

1232
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,190
Till I make sense of it.

1233
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,250
I'll get you some blankets and a pillow.

1234
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:11,450
How can you be so sanguine about this?

1235
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,690
Those dreams that I was sharing
with the authorities

1236
01:19:13,691 --> 01:19:15,291
had nothing to do with Lydecker.

1237
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:16,170
I know that.

1238
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,420
All right.Then you tell me
how the company is affected

1239
01:19:18,430 --> 01:19:21,560
if I help the police catch
whoever is killing these women.

1240
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,320
I can't. I don't think it would be.

1241
01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:24,470
Exactly.

1242
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:27,150
Mr. Lydecker treated me like
I was some kind of traitor.

1243
01:19:27,190 --> 01:19:29,970
Like I was sharing secrets
with his biggest competitor.

1244
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:33,470
I started to think that he was going
to fire me right then and there.

1245
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,490
Well,he could have.

1246
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,030
I mean,you did violate
the terms of your contract.

1247
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:40,200
Excuse me to help stop a murderer.

1248
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:42,180
But that's not his concern.

1249
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:44,570
That's not the business that he's in.

1250
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:47,990
Look,is this guy going to be
named citizen of the year? No.

1251
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,680
But... hold on a sec.
Don't jump down my throat here.

1252
01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:52,530
He does have kind of a point.

1253
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:56,620
Your ideas,your thoughts are one
of the things that he's paying for.

1254
01:19:56,650 --> 01:19:58,520
It was the same thing when
I worked at Aerodytech.

1255
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,500
Everything that I thought up
belonged to them.

1256
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:03,840
No,you want to talk
smic right and wrong?

1257
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:06,710
Yeah,you did a good
thing by calling Scanlon.

1258
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:08,080
And that's to your credit.

1259
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:09,420
But let's just say that I...

1260
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:13,290
I dreamed up an idea where I could
solve all the world's energy problems

1261
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:16,770
while I was at Aerodytech and
I brought it straight to the UN.

1262
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,950
Do you think that my employers
would have patted me on the back,

1263
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,880
or do you think they would have
sued me for everything I had?

1264
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,930
Doesn't make sense.
None of this makes sense.

1265
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:27,870
Yeah,well,welcome to corporate America.

1266
01:20:58,350 --> 01:20:59,960
Oh,God.

1267
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,850
Oh,God... Oh,God.

1268
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,390
<i>750 Wick Ave APT B</i>

1269
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,200
Justin.

1270
01:21:45,230 --> 01:21:47,540
Oh,my God,it was Justin.

1271
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:52,960
