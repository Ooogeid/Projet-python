00:00:02,868 --> 00:00:05,470
<i>Arianna: "dear dad,</i>

2
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:09,240
<i>"as I sit down to write this, I'm thinking
about you and me.</i>

3
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:10,809
<i>"there's one time in particular</i>

4
00:00:10,876 --> 00:00:13,044
<i>"that I can't get out of my head.</i>

5
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:14,846
<i>"I took our housekeeper's matches</i>

6
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:17,315
<i>"and I set the leaves in the
backyard on fire.</i>

7
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:19,617
<i>"then I tried to blame her.</i>

8
00:00:19,685 --> 00:00:22,687
<i>"you knew better, of course.</i>

9
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:24,823
<i>"and you used it as an opportunity to teach
me</i>

10
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,326
<i>"the difference between lying
and being a liar.</i>

11
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:32,664
<i>"I learned that day that I could
say anything to you,</i>

12
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:34,332
<i>"and that whatever we
had to deal with,</i>

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,570
<i>"your love for me would
never go away.</i>

14
00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:42,040
<i>"I guess that's why I'm writing this to
you.</i>

15
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:45,310
<i>"I know you and mom are
worried about me.</i>

16
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:47,812
<i>"I know you think I'm not handling college
well,</i>

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,647
<i>"that I'm adrift.</i>

18
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:52,784
<i>"and I guess you're both right.</i>

19
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:55,854
<i>But it's a little more
complicated than that."</i>

20
00:01:04,663 --> 00:01:06,564
Mmm.

21
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:07,766
You need anything?

22
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,335
Your mom wasn't sure that you would have

23
00:01:10,402 --> 00:01:12,437
Enough money left after buying your books.

24
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:15,373
No, I'm fine, dad.

25
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:18,009
<i>"I'm so glad you came all the
way out to see me.</i>

26
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,544
<i>"I know you're busy.</i>

27
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:24,182
<i>"and I wanted to talk to you,
really talk to you,</i>

28
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,217
<i>"but I just couldn't.</i>

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,922
<i>"that's my fault, dad, not yours.</i>

30
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:35,794
<i>"so I'm going to say everything now.</i>

31
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:37,462
<i>"I know that's not fair.</i>

32
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,265
<i>"but please don't be too mad at me.</i>

33
00:01:40,332 --> 00:01:43,735
<i>"this is something I've been thinking about
doing</i>

34
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,171
<i>"for a while now.</i>

35
00:01:46,238 --> 00:01:47,505
<i>"and I want you to know</i>

36
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:50,575
<i>That it would have happened no matter
what."</i>

37
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:53,578
(knocking on door)

38
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,280
<i>"I've been so confused.</i>

39
00:01:55,347 --> 00:01:56,948
<i>And this thing, it's..."</i>

40
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,483
Arianna?

41
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,553
<i>"...Like a lighthouse in the middle of all
that.</i>

42
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,288
<i>"it's so easy to steer toward,</i>

43
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:05,857
<i>"that I feel like it's where I have to
go.</i>

44
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:09,494
<i>"the first thing I want to say is that I'm
sorry.</i>

45
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,563
<i>"I hope that, since this
is the last time</i>

46
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,299
<i>"I'm going to talk to you,
I can give you what you need</i>

47
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:17,869
<i>"to come to terms with
what I've done.</i>

48
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:21,039
<i>"you're my dear dad.</i>

49
00:02:21,106 --> 00:02:23,007
<i>I can say anything to you,
right, dad?"</i>

50
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:24,075
Hello?

51
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,714
Ari!

52
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:36,554
Arianna?

53
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:49,033
(shouting indistinctly)

54
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:52,237
(sobbing)

55
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:53,338
(gasps)

56
00:02:53,405 --> 00:02:56,040
(panting)

57
00:02:56,108 --> 00:03:06,044
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

58
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,031
Departure time is t-minus five minutes.

59
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,499
If you're not on the train,

60
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:47,567
You're going to be left at the station.

61
00:03:47,635 --> 00:03:48,568
Can you help?

62
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:49,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks.

63
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:51,338
Marie, honey, you got five minutes.

64
00:03:51,406 --> 00:03:53,040
I just want to finish this chapter.

65
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,709
Well, you can finish in the car.

66
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,744
Hey, is this a library book?

67
00:03:57,812 --> 00:03:58,879
Where'd you get this?

68
00:03:58,946 --> 00:04:00,447
We haven't been to the library in ages.

69
00:04:00,515 --> 00:04:01,648
It was in my closet.

70
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:03,417
Well, when was it due?

71
00:04:03,484 --> 00:04:04,985
I don't know. I didn't take it out.

72
00:04:05,053 --> 00:04:06,553
Well, who did?

73
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,621
Who do you think?

74
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,857
Well, somebody must have cleaned the room

75
00:04:10,925 --> 00:04:13,326
And just stuck it in the closet.

76
00:04:13,394 --> 00:04:14,727
Somebody?

77
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:15,929
Bridge, that isn't your book.

78
00:04:15,996 --> 00:04:17,497
It belongs to the library.

79
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:19,566
Yeah, well, I guess I
forgot they were in there.

80
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:20,700
"they?"

81
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:22,235
How many have you got in there?

82
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,469
I don't know.

83
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:25,605
I mean, they let you check
out seven at a time.

84
00:04:25,673 --> 00:04:29,642
Bridgette, you have seven
overdue books in your closet?

85
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,644
You're not supposed to
take the library books,

86
00:04:31,712 --> 00:04:33,479
You're supposed to bring them back.

87
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:35,147
Well, it's too late now.

88
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:36,716
I mean, if I brought them back,

89
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:39,118
Then they would send me
to jail or something.

90
00:04:39,186 --> 00:04:40,586
They're not going to send you to jail.

91
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:41,987
They're going to charge you a fine.

92
00:04:42,055 --> 00:04:44,023
I'm guessing it's going to be big.

93
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:46,192
My hunch is your allowance
is going straight to

94
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:47,960
The public library for the next few months.

95
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:49,862
But library books are supposed to be free.

96
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,098
They are free, as long
as you play by the rules.

97
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:54,100
After school today,
I want you to walk over there

98
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:55,101
And return those books.

99
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:56,369
Fine.

100
00:04:58,372 --> 00:04:59,939
(phone ringing) I was reading that!

101
00:05:00,006 --> 00:05:01,307
Well, too bad.

102
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,842
Go check it out at the library.

103
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:04,677
(sighs)

104
00:05:04,745 --> 00:05:05,678
(phone beeps)

105
00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:06,679
Hello.

106
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:07,713
Devalos: Morning.

107
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:09,482
Um, sorry to bother you so early.

108
00:05:09,549 --> 00:05:10,616
Oh, no, no, no.

109
00:05:10,684 --> 00:05:12,084
It's no bother, mr. District attorney.

110
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:13,953
I was wondering if I could ask a favor.

111
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,622
Wondering if there was any way
I could get you to drop by

112
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,524
My house on your way to work this morning,

113
00:05:18,592 --> 00:05:19,525
Say around 9:00?

114
00:05:19,593 --> 00:05:21,394
Course. Is everything all right?

115
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:24,029
Nothing that can't hold until 9:00.

116
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:44,083
Nice hair.

117
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:45,418
Nice glasses.

118
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:04,236
As you both know, our daughter
arianna took her own life

119
00:06:04,304 --> 00:06:06,305
During her sophomore year of college.

120
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:09,275
Today is the anniversary
of the day she died,

121
00:06:09,342 --> 00:06:10,643
The day I found her.

122
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:19,852
Losing a child...

123
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,421
Is always a nightmare for any parent.

124
00:06:22,489 --> 00:06:27,226
For us, I think it's been
especially difficult.

125
00:06:27,294 --> 00:06:29,261
Arianna didn't leave a note.

126
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:32,498
She never told us why.

127
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:35,167
Nothing at all?

128
00:06:35,235 --> 00:06:37,403
She never communicated
with either one of you?

129
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:41,407
Devalos: Lily went out to get the newspaper,

130
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:44,743
And saw that the flag was up on the mailbox.

131
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:46,645
And when she looked inside,

132
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:48,848
She found this.

133
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,457
Oh, no.

134
00:06:58,525 --> 00:07:02,094
This is terrible.

135
00:07:02,162 --> 00:07:04,330
I'm so sorry.

136
00:07:04,397 --> 00:07:06,665
Devalos: I certainly made my
share of enemies over the years.

137
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:09,768
Put plenty of bad people in prison,

138
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:12,271
Even received death threats,

139
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:13,606
But never anything like this.

140
00:07:13,673 --> 00:07:16,442
Never anything involving my family.

141
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,847
Would you please excuse me?

142
00:07:21,915 --> 00:07:23,916
(sobs softly)

143
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,953
You know, this is going to sound crazy.

144
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:31,056
I think I saw the man who did this.

145
00:07:32,592 --> 00:07:34,593
What are you talking about?

146
00:07:34,661 --> 00:07:36,996
I saw a man putting
something in your mailbox.

147
00:07:37,063 --> 00:07:39,899
I mean, I didn't really see it,
and he wasn't really there,

148
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:41,800
But I didn't realize that at the time.

149
00:07:41,868 --> 00:07:44,703
I actually got a pretty good look at him.

150
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:47,573
He was young, maybe 30.

151
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:51,243
Caucasian, tall, thin.

152
00:07:51,311 --> 00:07:54,380
And he was wearing these glasses.

153
00:07:54,447 --> 00:07:56,715
Kind of... Black, vintage frames.

154
00:07:56,783 --> 00:07:59,184
Ring any bells?

155
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:01,754
No, I don't think so.

156
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:03,188
Okay, I'll tell you what--

157
00:08:03,256 --> 00:08:04,523
I'm going to canvass the neighborhood,

158
00:08:04,591 --> 00:08:06,125
See if anyone else saw this guy.

159
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:08,127
I'm also going to have
someone at the station

160
00:08:08,194 --> 00:08:09,995
Put together a file of all your cases.

161
00:08:10,063 --> 00:08:12,665
A mug-book of everyone you've tried.

162
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:15,167
If the guy who left this
really is someone you put away,

163
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:18,504
Then, well, hopefully,
allison will recognize him.

164
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,908
Young lady, these books are very late.

165
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:25,077
You've had them for more than a year now.

166
00:08:25,145 --> 00:08:27,012
I know.

167
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,049
I, uh, guess I just kind
of lost track of them.

168
00:08:30,116 --> 00:08:31,483
I'm sorry.

169
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:33,319
But they were really good.

170
00:08:33,386 --> 00:08:34,920
Glad you thought so.

171
00:08:34,988 --> 00:08:38,123
Now maybe some other
children can enjoy them, too.

172
00:08:38,191 --> 00:08:40,993
I'm afraid we've already
forwarded these to collections.

173
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:43,862
You owe the retail cost of the books.

174
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,866
Which comes out to $92.18.

175
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:49,735
Ninety-two dollars?!

176
00:08:49,803 --> 00:08:50,836
I'm just a kid!

177
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:52,504
Where am I supposed to get $92?

178
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:55,507
Uh, you're not going to
call the police, are you?

179
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:57,009
Am I going to get arrested?

180
00:08:57,077 --> 00:08:59,111
What about asking your parents?

181
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:01,880
No. I don't want to do that.

182
00:09:01,948 --> 00:09:03,949
They're already really mad at me.

183
00:09:06,987 --> 00:09:09,355
I might have an idea.

184
00:09:09,422 --> 00:09:10,556
<i>Ariel: You're working</i>

185
00:09:10,624 --> 00:09:11,957
At the library?

186
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:13,659
Why are you so surprised?

187
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,660
I don't know.

188
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:15,794
It just seems odd

189
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:17,896
That someone would depend
on you to do anything.

190
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:19,565
Hey, I'm dependable.

191
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:21,400
And besides, they've got books laying around

192
00:09:21,468 --> 00:09:22,868
All over the place in there.

193
00:09:22,936 --> 00:09:23,936
So this is good.

194
00:09:24,004 --> 00:09:25,504
I'm helping them with their problem,

195
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:27,673
And instead of paying me,
they're paying off the fines.

196
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:29,608
Joe: It sounds like a pretty good

197
00:09:29,676 --> 00:09:31,477
Solution to me.

198
00:09:31,544 --> 00:09:33,445
Honey, don't eat any ice
cream before dinner.

199
00:09:33,513 --> 00:09:36,048
Well, when are we going to eat?

200
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:37,049
I'm hungry.

201
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:38,283
I don't know.

202
00:09:38,351 --> 00:09:39,418
That's a good question. Where's your mom?

203
00:09:39,486 --> 00:09:40,419
She's been in her room

204
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:41,487
For the past couple hours.

205
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:48,494
Hey, you hungry?

206
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:50,095
Should I order some pizzas?

207
00:09:50,163 --> 00:09:52,297
No, no; we have some leftovers in the fridge

208
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:53,632
I was going to heat up.

209
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,200
I'm sorry, I got so caught up

210
00:09:55,268 --> 00:09:56,235
With these files.

211
00:09:56,302 --> 00:09:57,469
Still no luck?

212
00:09:57,537 --> 00:09:59,638
I've looked through every single person

213
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:01,974
That devalos ever put away,
and none of them look like

214
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:04,243
The man I saw leave that awful card.

215
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,545
Well, maybe it's time to
pack it in for the night.

216
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:07,646
I guess so.

217
00:10:07,714 --> 00:10:09,081
I just wish I could do something.

218
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:10,416
I wish I could help.

219
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:11,984
Well, wait a second.

220
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:14,420
Aren't you actually that psychic woman

221
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:16,321
Who, uh, gave the police

222
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:19,091
A description of the guy who did this?

223
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,125
Very funny.

224
00:10:20,193 --> 00:10:22,194
You know what I can't figure out?

225
00:10:22,262 --> 00:10:23,796
The pythagorean theorem?

226
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:28,867
Last night, I had a dream about
devalos and his daughter.

227
00:10:28,935 --> 00:10:33,672
And in it, I saw him find a suicide note.

228
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,674
I even heard what the note said.

229
00:10:35,742 --> 00:10:37,643
I mean, most of it, anyway.

230
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:39,912
But then when I went to
his house this morning,

231
00:10:39,979 --> 00:10:42,815
His wife said that arianna
never left anything behind.

232
00:10:42,882 --> 00:10:44,483
Now, why would he do that?

233
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:46,885
Why would he keep something
like that from her?

234
00:10:46,953 --> 00:10:48,020
(sighs softly)

235
00:10:48,088 --> 00:10:49,254
I have no idea.

236
00:10:50,757 --> 00:10:53,325
Hey, you want to take the kids out?

237
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:55,828
I know it's a school night, but, you know,

238
00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:59,031
It might be fun to take the kids out.

239
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:01,200
<i>Devalos: Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury,</i>

240
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,602
No attorney relishes the prospect

241
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,637
Of taking on a case

242
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:08,574
That involves the sexual
assault of a young woman.

243
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:10,776
It forces us to ask uncomfortable questions

244
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:13,145
About the personal behavior

245
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:14,813
Of both the alleged assailant

246
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:17,382
And the alleged victim.

247
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,986
In this case, we will have to
look closely at what happened

248
00:11:21,054 --> 00:11:24,156
On the night that deanna whalen,
by her own admission,

249
00:11:24,224 --> 00:11:27,326
Willingly accompanied the
defendant back to his home.

250
00:11:28,995 --> 00:11:32,131
That they had sex not once, not twice,

251
00:11:32,198 --> 00:11:34,600
But three times over the
course of the evening

252
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,101
Is not in dispute.

253
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:39,538
And yet, miss whalen maintains
that a crime has been committed.

254
00:11:39,606 --> 00:11:43,509
That she gave him her
phone number the next day

255
00:11:43,576 --> 00:11:46,512
Is also not in dispute.

256
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:49,548
But still, she claims that she
was not a willing participant

257
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:51,250
In the previous evening's events.

258
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:54,286
Miss whalen even concedes
that it took her three days

259
00:11:54,354 --> 00:11:57,790
Before deciding to call the police.

260
00:11:57,857 --> 00:11:59,525
And now she cites her inability

261
00:11:59,592 --> 00:12:02,594
To recall the precise events
of the evening as proof

262
00:12:02,662 --> 00:12:06,498
That mr. Gerwin must have
drugged her and raped her.

263
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:08,100
(sighs)

264
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:10,903
Quite a story.

265
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,771
But that's all it is.

266
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,374
A story.

267
00:12:15,441 --> 00:12:17,342
And the district attorney knows it.

268
00:12:19,112 --> 00:12:22,815
Now, the prosecution will
attempt to portray the defendant

269
00:12:22,882 --> 00:12:25,017
As a man of low character, but he is not.

270
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:28,320
They will paint my argument
as an attack on miss whalen,

271
00:12:28,388 --> 00:12:30,756
But it is not.

272
00:12:30,824 --> 00:12:33,692
Truth be told, my client
is guilty of nothing more

273
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,961
Than participating in consensual sex,

274
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:38,697
And the irony is,
his accuser is guilty of the same.

275
00:12:38,765 --> 00:12:40,999
And yet, she seeks to use this court

276
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:45,270
And you, this jury,
as a kind of legal absolution,

277
00:12:45,338 --> 00:12:46,972
As a way to wash away her sins

278
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,308
So she needn't take responsibility for them.

279
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:52,077
There's only one problem with that.

280
00:12:52,145 --> 00:12:55,848
William gerwin is not a rapist.

281
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:58,817
William gerwin is an innocent man.

282
00:13:05,203 --> 00:13:07,004
Yep. That's definitely him.

283
00:13:07,072 --> 00:13:10,674
That's definitely william gerwin.

284
00:13:10,742 --> 00:13:13,344
Back when I worked

285
00:13:13,411 --> 00:13:15,379
As a defense attorney at mcclenahan-everett,

286
00:13:15,447 --> 00:13:17,214
Mr. Gerwin was one of my clients.

287
00:13:17,282 --> 00:13:19,450
A rather important one, actually.

288
00:13:19,517 --> 00:13:22,786
He was the son of one of the partners.

289
00:13:22,854 --> 00:13:24,488
He was 22 when he was accused

290
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:27,625
Of drugging and raping a young
woman that he met at a party.

291
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:29,660
Her name was deanna whalen.

292
00:13:29,728 --> 00:13:32,830
Gerwin's father personally asked me

293
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:34,531
To take his son's case as a favor.

294
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:36,767
And... (sighs)

295
00:13:36,835 --> 00:13:39,403
I was only too happy to oblige.

296
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:41,872
The case was very weak.

297
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,141
A classic "he-said, she-said."

298
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:45,843
Rape kit was never administered.

299
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,078
No drugs were found in the girl's system.

300
00:13:48,146 --> 00:13:49,913
She didn't even file a
report with the police

301
00:13:49,981 --> 00:13:52,716
Until several days after
the alleged incident.

302
00:13:52,784 --> 00:13:55,719
The ada who was handling
gerwin's prosecution

303
00:13:55,787 --> 00:13:57,221
Knew the odds were against him,

304
00:13:57,289 --> 00:13:59,056
And he offered me a deal early on,

305
00:13:59,124 --> 00:14:02,026
But I-I turned it down.

306
00:14:02,093 --> 00:14:05,162
That's how confident I was in the case.

307
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,463
I remember that case.

308
00:14:06,531 --> 00:14:08,532
That kid wound up going to jail, didn't he?

309
00:14:10,135 --> 00:14:12,936
Someone sent a collection of videos

310
00:14:13,004 --> 00:14:14,238
To the district attorney's office

311
00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:15,906
In the middle of the trial.

312
00:14:15,974 --> 00:14:17,741
Never found out who sent them,

313
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:21,145
But it didn't much matter.

314
00:14:21,212 --> 00:14:23,814
They were videos that
william had made of himself

315
00:14:23,882 --> 00:14:26,450
Having sex with unconscious
and obviously drugged women,

316
00:14:26,518 --> 00:14:28,686
Including deanna whalen.

317
00:14:28,753 --> 00:14:30,654
The deal I'd been offered

318
00:14:30,722 --> 00:14:32,222
Evaporated.

319
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,224
William was given the maximum sentence,

320
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:36,593
And I left mcclenaha
n-everett shortly after that.

321
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:38,662
I-I'm sorry, sir.

322
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,397
If he received a maximum sentence,

323
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:42,833
Then how could he be the
one to leave you that card?

324
00:14:42,901 --> 00:14:46,837
Turns out, he was recently
granted an early parole.

325
00:14:46,905 --> 00:14:48,939
It seems that one of his cell mates

326
00:14:49,007 --> 00:14:50,441
Took him into his confidence one night,

327
00:14:50,508 --> 00:14:53,644
Told him the details of an unsolved murder,

328
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:56,046
Something to do with organized crime.

329
00:14:56,114 --> 00:14:57,481
It was a federal case,

330
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:00,150
So gerwin went to the local fbi office.

331
00:15:00,218 --> 00:15:02,286
And in exchange for his sealed testimony,

332
00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:04,388
Time was shaved off his sentence.

333
00:15:04,456 --> 00:15:05,989
As I understand it,

334
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:08,125
Gerwin never even had to appear

335
00:15:08,193 --> 00:15:09,927
In open court.

336
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:11,428
The man gerwin sent to jail

337
00:15:11,496 --> 00:15:14,031
Never even knew who offered him up.

338
00:15:16,034 --> 00:15:18,635
And you're absolutely
certain that william gerwin

339
00:15:18,703 --> 00:15:21,372
Is the man you saw put this card in the box?

340
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:22,873
It was him, sir.

341
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:24,441
I'm sure of it.

342
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:26,076
I already reached out to his parole officer.

343
00:15:26,144 --> 00:15:28,712
We're bringing gerwin in for
questioning in a few hours.

344
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,682
If he really was the one who
left that note in your mailbox,

345
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,452
Well, let's just say

346
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,588
I intend to make damn sure
he doesn't leave another.

347
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:42,359
839.2...

348
00:15:53,304 --> 00:15:55,305
Whoa. Cool.

349
00:16:07,786 --> 00:16:09,586
Miss aiken, who's that guy?

350
00:16:09,654 --> 00:16:12,089
Oh, nobody special.

351
00:16:12,157 --> 00:16:15,726
Just a fellow who comes in
every day to use the computers.

352
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,144
"prince"?

353
00:16:39,217 --> 00:16:41,452
No, I've never seen this card before.

354
00:16:43,154 --> 00:16:46,089
I certainly didn't leave it for mr. Devalos.

355
00:16:46,157 --> 00:16:47,324
(sighs)

356
00:16:47,392 --> 00:16:48,459
So, is that it?

357
00:16:48,526 --> 00:16:50,160
Can I go now?

358
00:16:50,228 --> 00:16:51,328
Not just yet, mr. Gerwin.

359
00:16:51,396 --> 00:16:53,730
Okay.

360
00:16:53,798 --> 00:16:55,232
So what else do you want to talk about?

361
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,968
How is the "man-man" doing, anyway?

362
00:16:58,036 --> 00:16:59,636
That's what my dad used to call him.

363
00:16:59,704 --> 00:17:03,607
Manny didn't like it very much,
but what can you do, right?

364
00:17:03,675 --> 00:17:06,176
Well, you seem to be
having a pretty good time.

365
00:17:06,244 --> 00:17:08,479
What would you say

366
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:10,681
If I told you that we had an anonymous tip

367
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:12,649
From someone who says that they saw you

368
00:17:12,717 --> 00:17:14,952
Put that card in devalos's mailbox?

369
00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:18,889
Well, the first thing I'd say is,
"your tipster is mistaken."

370
00:17:18,957 --> 00:17:21,391
But even if he or she weren't,

371
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:23,126
What's with the hard-ass routine?

372
00:17:23,194 --> 00:17:26,830
I mean, whoever left this card,
did they do something illegal?

373
00:17:26,898 --> 00:17:30,634
Is there a law against mailing
people greeting cards?

374
00:17:30,702 --> 00:17:33,770
There are laws against harassment.

375
00:17:33,838 --> 00:17:35,739
And does this card break that law?

376
00:17:35,807 --> 00:17:37,808
Mr. Gerwin, you're on parole, right?

377
00:17:41,946 --> 00:17:44,448
If we want to, we can make
life very difficult for you.

378
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,318
So why don't you just admit what you did,

379
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:50,020
And we can get this thing cleared up today?

380
00:17:50,088 --> 00:17:52,489
Because I didn't do it.

381
00:17:52,557 --> 00:17:54,224
I've never been to his house.

382
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:55,726
I haven't thought about him in years.

383
00:17:55,793 --> 00:17:56,894
You sure about that?

384
00:17:56,961 --> 00:17:59,396
The "man-man" was your lawyer.

385
00:17:59,464 --> 00:18:01,832
You got convicted.

386
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,333
You're not holding a grudge?

387
00:18:03,401 --> 00:18:06,503
Why would I hold a grudge?

388
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:08,839
I raped that girl.

389
00:18:08,907 --> 00:18:10,440
I went to jail.

390
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:13,677
Why would I be mad at my attorney?

391
00:18:13,745 --> 00:18:15,412
Rich kid like you

392
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,514
Probably had a pretty
rough go of it in prison.

393
00:18:17,582 --> 00:18:20,684
I wouldn't be surprised
if you got a little taste

394
00:18:20,752 --> 00:18:22,286
Of your own medicine, once or twice.

395
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:24,354
(chuckles dryly)

396
00:18:24,422 --> 00:18:26,924
Once or twice?

397
00:18:26,991 --> 00:18:30,627
I spent years getting "
a taste of my own medicine."

398
00:18:30,695 --> 00:18:32,896
That what you wanted to hear?

399
00:18:32,964 --> 00:18:35,499
That there's a ying for every yang?

400
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:36,733
That I got what I deserve?

401
00:18:36,801 --> 00:18:39,803
Well... There it is.

402
00:18:42,106 --> 00:18:44,141
Now, if this card upset your boss,

403
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,411
I don't know what to tell you.

404
00:18:47,478 --> 00:18:49,313
But me?

405
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,048
The new me?

406
00:18:51,115 --> 00:18:54,418
I'm a firm believer that if
you get a card like this,

407
00:18:54,485 --> 00:18:55,586
You probably deserved it.

408
00:18:55,653 --> 00:19:00,324
So maybe you should be
sitting your boss down,

409
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:04,328
Asking him why he thinks he got this.

410
00:19:04,395 --> 00:19:06,396
<i>Allison: He was so smug.</i>

411
00:19:06,464 --> 00:19:08,632
He was practically rubbing our noses

412
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,067
In the fact that he did it.

413
00:19:10,134 --> 00:19:11,702
Well you've got to hand it to him.

414
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:13,604
He figured out a way to get attention.

415
00:19:13,671 --> 00:19:15,872
To work out his anger at your boss.

416
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,808
But he's on parole, right?

417
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,343
He's essentially impotent.

418
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,478
If he does anything,
he goes right back to jail.

419
00:19:21,546 --> 00:19:23,914
So he-he sends that card.

420
00:19:23,982 --> 00:19:25,983
He gets a rise out of a bunch of people.

421
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,151
It's kind of like a child, don't you think?

422
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:29,786
Like a child?

423
00:19:29,854 --> 00:19:31,355
He raped a teenage girl,

424
00:19:31,422 --> 00:19:33,256
And when he couldn't get away with it,

425
00:19:33,324 --> 00:19:34,424
He blamed his lawyer.

426
00:19:34,492 --> 00:19:36,560
There's nothing childlike about that.

427
00:19:36,628 --> 00:19:40,163
Uh, dad? Can you come look at the computer?

428
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:42,833
Stay. Stew. Finish your beer.

429
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,301
Finish my beer, if you like.

430
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:47,704
I mean, look at this.
Suddenly, I have 200 e-mails

431
00:19:47,772 --> 00:19:49,139
That I didn't have this morning.

432
00:19:49,207 --> 00:19:51,775
I mean, I don't want to earn
six figures selling real estate

433
00:19:51,843 --> 00:19:53,377
In my spare time. I don't care

434
00:19:53,444 --> 00:19:55,779
About getting $5,
000 from "cash for clunkers"

435
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:57,247
Without even turning in my car.

436
00:19:57,315 --> 00:19:59,416
And I don't want to hear from
this "prince abantu" again

437
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:02,719
About how he can't get at
his $20 million inheritance.

438
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:06,189
Did you guys say something
about prince abantu?

439
00:20:06,257 --> 00:20:08,659
Did you download the latest
version of spam blocker?

440
00:20:08,726 --> 00:20:11,595
No. You told me not to
download anything, so I didn't.

441
00:20:11,663 --> 00:20:13,363
Okay. Scoot over.

442
00:20:13,431 --> 00:20:14,831
Let me drive for a minute.

443
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:16,967
Did someone say something
about prince abantu?

444
00:20:17,035 --> 00:20:19,603
Yeah. Why?

445
00:20:19,671 --> 00:20:20,804
I think I know him.

446
00:20:20,872 --> 00:20:24,374
You don't know him. He's not real.

447
00:20:24,442 --> 00:20:26,977
I mean, he's a scammer who
claims to be a nigerian prince

448
00:20:27,045 --> 00:20:30,380
Who needs help recovering
frozen assets from some trust.

449
00:20:30,448 --> 00:20:33,550
I mean, it's like, you give him $10,000,

450
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:34,918
And he gives you a million.

451
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:36,253
No. You're wrong.

452
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,021
Prince abantu's a real guy.

453
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:39,956
He goes to the library where I work.

454
00:20:40,024 --> 00:20:42,292
You can come visit him, if you want.

455
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,461
I mean, he's there all the time.

456
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:46,229
And I wouldn't delete that if I were you.

457
00:20:46,297 --> 00:20:48,131
All we have to do is
just send him some money,

458
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:49,866
And then we can move into a bigger house.

459
00:20:49,934 --> 00:20:51,034
(chuckling): Bridgette.

460
00:20:51,102 --> 00:20:52,936
He doesn't look like a scammer to me.

461
00:20:53,004 --> 00:20:55,238
He looks like a prince.
I mean, he wears robes,

462
00:20:55,306 --> 00:20:57,607
And he carries this big stick thing and...

463
00:20:57,675 --> 00:20:59,409
I don't know who you saw, sweetie,

464
00:20:59,477 --> 00:21:01,545
But I got to side with ariel on this one.

465
00:21:01,612 --> 00:21:03,880
This is one of the oldest
tricks in the book.

466
00:21:03,948 --> 00:21:06,016
I've gotten 100 e-mails like this.

467
00:21:06,084 --> 00:21:07,284
People who send them aren't connected

468
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:08,719
To african royalty

469
00:21:08,786 --> 00:21:10,887
In any way, shape, or form;
they're just criminals.

470
00:21:10,955 --> 00:21:14,825
Okay, but I think you're wrong.

471
00:21:14,892 --> 00:21:16,693
Okay.

472
00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:19,062
They were on a shelf in the bedroom;
hidden in plain sight.

473
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,198
Obviously, the cops never
bothered to actually look

474
00:21:21,265 --> 00:21:23,266
At the tapes when they searched his place.

475
00:21:23,334 --> 00:21:25,869
My people didn't, either,
the first time through.

476
00:21:25,937 --> 00:21:29,239
It's a good thing you sent
me to take a second look.

477
00:21:29,307 --> 00:21:30,741
Look inside.

478
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:38,515
Is this what I think it is?

479
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,584
Take a look.

480
00:21:45,923 --> 00:21:47,924
William: Here, have some of this.
Have a little drink.

481
00:21:47,992 --> 00:21:49,893
Deanna: Um, I don't...

482
00:21:49,961 --> 00:21:52,496
(low groan)

483
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:53,797
William: No?

484
00:21:53,865 --> 00:21:54,965
Deanna: Uh, no. No?

485
00:21:55,032 --> 00:21:56,633
I don't feel so good.

486
00:21:56,701 --> 00:21:57,834
William: No?

487
00:21:57,902 --> 00:21:59,269
No. No?

488
00:21:59,337 --> 00:22:00,904
No, I don't feel so good.

489
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:02,506
No?

490
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:04,007
(deanna groans softly)

491
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:05,542
Oh...

492
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,643
(vcr clicks off)

493
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:08,011
The others are just as bad.

494
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:10,480
Different girls, same drill.

495
00:22:10,548 --> 00:22:12,349
I know it's not what you were

496
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,518
Hoping I'd find, but at least now you know.

497
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:16,620
You'll be ready if there are
other copies floating around

498
00:22:16,687 --> 00:22:18,955
For the prosecution to latch onto.

499
00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:23,160
You want me

500
00:22:23,227 --> 00:22:24,161
To accidentally drop these

501
00:22:24,228 --> 00:22:25,395
In an incinerator?

502
00:22:25,463 --> 00:22:28,965
No, that's, uh, that's not necessary.

503
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:30,300
I'll take care of them.

504
00:22:30,368 --> 00:22:32,102
Thank you, walter.

505
00:23:12,577 --> 00:23:14,377
(gasps)

506
00:23:16,198 --> 00:23:19,994
I'm telling you manuel devalos
torpedoed his own case.

507
00:23:20,552 --> 00:23:23,721
Manuel devalos, the most honest, ethical man

508
00:23:23,788 --> 00:23:25,222
I've ever met.

509
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,125
Not the second-most honest and
ethical man you've ever met?

510
00:23:28,193 --> 00:23:30,127
Oh, come on, joe.

511
00:23:30,195 --> 00:23:32,396
Why would he do that?

512
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:33,864
I don't know.

513
00:23:33,932 --> 00:23:35,933
Maybe, maybe 'cause he knew

514
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,602
The guy he was representing was guilty?

515
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,338
Maybe he was sick of representing rich scum.

516
00:23:41,406 --> 00:23:44,575
Or maybe he just wanted to give
lawyers everywhere a good name.

517
00:23:44,642 --> 00:23:46,410
No, I'm sorry.

518
00:23:46,478 --> 00:23:48,312
None of that explains it.

519
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:50,714
If he couldn't represent his
client in good conscience,

520
00:23:50,782 --> 00:23:53,450
Then he should have just
resigned from the case.

521
00:23:53,518 --> 00:23:56,754
What he did was a violation
of attorney-client privilege.

522
00:23:56,821 --> 00:23:58,956
Hell, what he did was illegal.

523
00:23:59,023 --> 00:24:02,726
But don't you kind of admire him for it?

524
00:24:02,794 --> 00:24:06,363
A bad man, a dangerous man,

525
00:24:06,431 --> 00:24:08,966
Who might otherwise have
walked free, went to jail.

526
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:11,034
Sorry. I'm on team devalos.

527
00:24:11,102 --> 00:24:14,037
Yeah, well, if the truth be told,

528
00:24:14,105 --> 00:24:16,607
So am I.

529
00:24:16,674 --> 00:24:18,609
But why am I dreaming this?

530
00:24:18,676 --> 00:24:20,444
What am I supposed to do with it?

531
00:24:20,512 --> 00:24:23,380
I've been waiting for one
this easy for a long time.

532
00:24:23,448 --> 00:24:25,382
You do nothing.

533
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,119
And you admire your boss
just a little bit more.

534
00:24:29,187 --> 00:24:30,354
I know I do.

535
00:24:30,421 --> 00:24:32,556
And you definitely don't say anything

536
00:24:32,624 --> 00:24:33,857
To anybody about this.

537
00:24:33,925 --> 00:24:36,193
That's what you do.

538
00:24:39,964 --> 00:24:42,599
(siren wailing in distance,
indistinct police radio chatter)

539
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:50,007
Scanlon: Hey.

540
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:51,108
Thanks for coming by.

541
00:24:51,176 --> 00:24:54,111
Everything okay?

542
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:55,279
Honestly, I'm not sure.

543
00:24:55,346 --> 00:24:57,281
This is a weird one.

544
00:24:57,348 --> 00:24:59,316
A girl named jennifer
ludlow rents this place.

545
00:24:59,384 --> 00:25:00,317
She's a bartender.

546
00:25:00,385 --> 00:25:01,585
Community college student.

547
00:25:01,653 --> 00:25:04,421
Slept at her boyfriend's place last night.

548
00:25:04,489 --> 00:25:05,923
Gets home early this morning,

549
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,257
Finds the door like that.

550
00:25:07,325 --> 00:25:09,526
Someone forced their way into her place.

551
00:25:09,594 --> 00:25:11,428
But she's all right?

552
00:25:11,496 --> 00:25:13,797
Oh, yeah, she's fine; there was no one here.

553
00:25:13,865 --> 00:25:15,065
There's nothing missing, either.

554
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:16,700
So what are we doing here?

555
00:25:20,171 --> 00:25:21,505
Someone put one of these

556
00:25:21,573 --> 00:25:24,408
In every picture frame in the place.

557
00:25:26,177 --> 00:25:28,478
Okay, I'll ask. What is this?

558
00:25:28,546 --> 00:25:29,847
Can't say for sure.

559
00:25:29,914 --> 00:25:33,183
Seems like someone's trying
to send manny a message.

560
00:25:33,251 --> 00:25:35,619
I know what you're thinking:
Our friend william gerwin.

561
00:25:35,687 --> 00:25:37,654
The problem is the scene's clean.

562
00:25:37,722 --> 00:25:39,857
So far, we haven't found any
physical evidence at all.

563
00:25:39,924 --> 00:25:41,425
None of the neighbors saw anything.

564
00:25:41,492 --> 00:25:42,459
We got bupkis.

565
00:25:42,527 --> 00:25:44,394
Does devalos know about this?

566
00:25:44,462 --> 00:25:45,996
He didn't want to come down.

567
00:25:46,064 --> 00:25:47,431
Just said, "thanks for telling me."

568
00:25:47,498 --> 00:25:48,498
Seemed kind of distracted.

569
00:25:48,566 --> 00:25:51,301
Anyway, feel free to look around.

570
00:25:51,369 --> 00:25:53,237
And holler if you get a bite.

571
00:25:53,304 --> 00:25:55,639
Of course.

572
00:25:55,707 --> 00:25:58,642
Devalos: You've reached the
voicemail of manuel devalos.

573
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,110
Please leave a message,

574
00:26:00,178 --> 00:26:02,813
And I'll get back to you as
soon as I can. Take this.

575
00:26:02,881 --> 00:26:05,082
Sir, can you give me a
call when you get this?

576
00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:08,118
I'm just leaving that woman
jennifer ludlow's apartment.

577
00:26:08,186 --> 00:26:09,419
Unfortunately, I didn't see anything

578
00:26:09,487 --> 00:26:10,954
That could be of any help,

579
00:26:11,022 --> 00:26:15,158
But I do need to talk to
you about your old client.

580
00:26:29,707 --> 00:26:32,042
We meet again.

581
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,277
You did this.

582
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,646
Sorry? Did what?

583
00:26:35,713 --> 00:26:37,681
Don't play coy.

584
00:26:37,749 --> 00:26:39,950
We both know what you're doing
and why you're doing it.

585
00:26:40,018 --> 00:26:41,184
Really?

586
00:26:41,252 --> 00:26:43,387
You know why?

587
00:26:43,454 --> 00:26:45,789
Well, if that's the case,

588
00:26:45,857 --> 00:26:47,891
If you really know what went on with me

589
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:49,159
And my legal representation,

590
00:26:49,227 --> 00:26:51,762
Then I'm sure you share my sense of outrage.

591
00:26:51,829 --> 00:26:53,597
See, I think I deserve

592
00:26:53,665 --> 00:26:56,166
What every other accused citizen deserves:

593
00:26:56,234 --> 00:26:57,801
A fair trial.

594
00:26:57,869 --> 00:27:01,004
And that means having a defense
attorney who's not serving me up

595
00:27:01,072 --> 00:27:03,473
On a silver platter to the prosecution.

596
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:05,375
What do you want?

597
00:27:05,443 --> 00:27:07,511
How is harassing this man
gonna change anything?

598
00:27:07,578 --> 00:27:10,347
Are you aware that after I was convicted,

599
00:27:10,415 --> 00:27:11,581
My family disowned me?

600
00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:15,085
It's true.

601
00:27:15,153 --> 00:27:17,554
So not only did I spend
all those years in prison,

602
00:27:17,622 --> 00:27:19,056
I came out with nothing.

603
00:27:19,123 --> 00:27:22,426
I'm a convicted felon. And I'm penniless.

604
00:27:22,493 --> 00:27:24,995
That man-- your boss--

605
00:27:25,063 --> 00:27:27,464
He destroyed me.

606
00:27:27,532 --> 00:27:30,200
So what do I want?

607
00:27:32,003 --> 00:27:35,038
<i>I guess I'd like to destroy him.</i>

608
00:27:35,106 --> 00:27:38,408
I want him to come forward
and admit what he did.

609
00:27:38,476 --> 00:27:39,876
I want him to lose his job.

610
00:27:39,944 --> 00:27:42,446
And I want him to go to jail.

611
00:27:42,513 --> 00:27:43,647
Well, that's crazy.

612
00:27:43,715 --> 00:27:45,382
That's never gonna happen.

613
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:50,087
Oh, I think it might.

614
00:27:50,154 --> 00:27:51,922
You know, I was really hoping

615
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,890
That manny was gonna come
down here this morning.

616
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:56,526
But you seem pretty close to him.

617
00:27:56,594 --> 00:27:58,829
Maybe you could give him a message for me.

618
00:27:58,896 --> 00:28:03,066
There's a reason why all
those articles wound up

619
00:28:03,134 --> 00:28:05,168
In jennifer ludlow's apartment.

620
00:28:05,236 --> 00:28:08,271
She's young, pretty.

621
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:10,674
Just my type.

622
00:28:10,742 --> 00:28:13,343
I don't understand.

623
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:14,644
Sometime soon,

624
00:28:14,712 --> 00:28:16,947
If the district attorney
doesn't come forward

625
00:28:17,015 --> 00:28:18,248
And admit what he did,

626
00:28:18,316 --> 00:28:21,118
I'm gonna rape jennifer ludlow.

627
00:28:24,956 --> 00:28:26,923
You should say something.

628
00:28:26,991 --> 00:28:29,292
You really are insane.

629
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,262
You know, the act of just
making that threat is

630
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,264
A violation of your parole?

631
00:28:34,332 --> 00:28:35,599
You're going back to jail.

632
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:37,634
I don't think so.

633
00:28:37,702 --> 00:28:39,703
Are you wearing a tape recorder?

634
00:28:39,771 --> 00:28:42,372
'cause if anyone asks if I made the threat,

635
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,774
I'll deny it.

636
00:28:43,841 --> 00:28:45,342
You'll never get near that that girl.

637
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,110
We will have people protecting her.

638
00:28:47,178 --> 00:28:48,545
We'll have people following you.

639
00:28:48,613 --> 00:28:50,414
Yeah, okay, but how close can they get?

640
00:28:50,481 --> 00:28:54,051
Can they follow me everywhere?

641
00:28:54,118 --> 00:28:57,020
If someone were following me right now,

642
00:28:57,088 --> 00:29:00,590
Do you really think they
could stop me from, say, uh,

643
00:29:00,658 --> 00:29:02,592
Breaking your neck?

644
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:08,498
If I didn't care about getting
caught, that is, and...

645
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:10,567
I don't.

646
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,737
Look, I get it.

647
00:29:13,805 --> 00:29:15,472
You and the people you work with,

648
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,574
You're gonna do what you're gonna do.

649
00:29:17,642 --> 00:29:19,609
You'll be watching pretty little jenny

650
00:29:19,677 --> 00:29:22,145
And you'll be watching pretty little me.

651
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:23,380
So maybe it'll be her.

652
00:29:23,448 --> 00:29:25,816
Maybe it'll be someone else.

653
00:29:25,883 --> 00:29:28,285
The important thing is is that devalos knows

654
00:29:28,352 --> 00:29:30,654
About all this ahead of time.

655
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:34,758
That way, if he doesn't step up,

656
00:29:34,826 --> 00:29:37,527
The girl I find...

657
00:29:37,595 --> 00:29:40,530
She won't just be my victim,

658
00:29:40,598 --> 00:29:43,266
She'll be his victim, too.

659
00:29:45,837 --> 00:29:48,505
Pretty good, right?

660
00:29:48,573 --> 00:29:50,173
That'll kill him, won't it?

661
00:29:50,241 --> 00:29:51,942
Good man like devalos.

662
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:54,010
Respected man.

663
00:29:54,078 --> 00:29:56,513
No way he'll be able to live with himself

664
00:29:56,581 --> 00:29:58,815
If he let's that happen.

665
00:30:06,524 --> 00:30:08,058
(typing)

666
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:19,936
Bridgette: I know who you are, you know.

667
00:30:20,004 --> 00:30:21,071
Pardon me?

668
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:22,339
I know you're a prince.

669
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:23,740
I know about the problem.

670
00:30:23,808 --> 00:30:26,276
I know about the money,
and I want to help you.

671
00:30:26,344 --> 00:30:29,779
I've got a little more than $38 saved up.

672
00:30:29,847 --> 00:30:33,083
But I know it's not much,
but it's what I've got.

673
00:30:33,151 --> 00:30:34,818
And when you get all that money

674
00:30:34,886 --> 00:30:36,486
That you've been writing to people about,

675
00:30:36,554 --> 00:30:38,622
You can pay me back.

676
00:30:38,689 --> 00:30:39,756
I just want enough

677
00:30:39,824 --> 00:30:42,092
To cover my library debt: $92.18.

678
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,728
I think you are mistaken, little girl.

679
00:30:44,795 --> 00:30:48,031
You've got me mixed up with somebody.

680
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:49,966
You don't have to pretend with me.

681
00:30:50,034 --> 00:30:52,502
I know you're a prince, okay?

682
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,870
I've read the e-mails.

683
00:30:53,938 --> 00:30:55,739
And I know that you have enemies everywhere,

684
00:30:55,806 --> 00:30:57,974
But I'm not one of them.

685
00:30:58,042 --> 00:31:00,744
And look, even if you don't
get all your money back,

686
00:31:00,811 --> 00:31:02,312
I want you to have this.

687
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:07,951
I'm sorry, young lady,
but you've got me mixed up.

688
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:09,052
I must get going.

689
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,321
No, you can't just not take my money

690
00:31:11,389 --> 00:31:13,924
Because I'm a little kid; that's not fair.

691
00:31:16,527 --> 00:31:17,794
Okay, okay, fine.

692
00:31:17,862 --> 00:31:19,529
Okay, give it to me.

693
00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:30,106
Isn't it a little early?

694
00:31:32,143 --> 00:31:35,645
No, what it is, is... A little cowardly.

695
00:31:35,713 --> 00:31:38,582
What it is, is selfish.

696
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:41,284
Your timing is impeccable.

697
00:31:41,352 --> 00:31:44,621
I was  a minute from making a clean getaway.

698
00:31:44,689 --> 00:31:47,457
Your assistant told me
where I could find you.

699
00:31:48,893 --> 00:31:50,827
Sir...

700
00:31:50,895 --> 00:31:53,563
We really need to talk.

701
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:57,934
So all I have to do to prevent this lunatic

702
00:31:58,002 --> 00:31:59,703
From keeping his promise is step forward

703
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,806
And declare myself a criminal?

704
00:32:02,873 --> 00:32:05,075
He knows what you did, sir.

705
00:32:05,142 --> 00:32:10,013
I don't know how he knows, but he knows.

706
00:32:10,081 --> 00:32:11,581
And I know it, too.

707
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:16,953
Look, I would never secon
d-guess what you did.

708
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:20,590
I might have done the same thing.

709
00:32:20,658 --> 00:32:23,093
And I know how much you stand to lose.

710
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,229
But unless there's something I'm not seeing,

711
00:32:26,297 --> 00:32:30,800
I don't think you can keep
this a secret much longer.

712
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:35,205
I think you need to start
telling people what you did.

713
00:32:35,273 --> 00:32:37,674
And not to give in to him...

714
00:32:37,742 --> 00:32:40,010
But to keep him from doing something

715
00:32:40,077 --> 00:32:42,712
That you would never recover from.

716
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,781
I mean...

717
00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:47,517
If he hurt some girl...

718
00:32:47,585 --> 00:32:50,320
I don't think you could live with that.

719
00:32:52,356 --> 00:32:55,792
There's a lot you're not seeing, allison.

720
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,795
But I appreciate your concern.

721
00:33:04,335 --> 00:33:05,669
Uh, sir?

722
00:33:08,072 --> 00:33:10,440
Sir, I'm a part of this, too, now.

723
00:33:10,508 --> 00:33:13,643
I don't want to be, but I am.

724
00:33:13,711 --> 00:33:16,680
If you don't come forward...

725
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:19,516
I don't know, I might have to.

726
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,922
Well, I guess we're each
gonna do what we have to do.

727
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:34,331
<i>Arianna: I can say anything to you, right,
dad?</i>

728
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:37,701
<i>Well, this is the last thing
you need to know,</i>

729
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:39,402
<i>The thing you're never gonna get</i>

730
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,838
<i>To help me deal with.</i>

731
00:33:41,906 --> 00:33:44,741
<i>This thing that's been
living inside me,</i>

732
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:47,277
<i>This cloud that I can't get out from
under,</i>

733
00:33:47,345 --> 00:33:50,080
<i>It's always been there,
but it started to get worse</i>

734
00:33:50,147 --> 00:33:51,981
<i>During my senior year of high school.</i>

735
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:54,984
<i>Kim and I went to this party.</i>

736
00:33:55,052 --> 00:33:58,355
<i>It was mostly college kids home
for their christmas break.</i>

737
00:33:58,422 --> 00:34:00,123
<i>There was a boy there.</i>

738
00:34:00,191 --> 00:34:02,759
<i>His name was william.</i>

739
00:34:02,827 --> 00:34:05,695
<i>He was a little older, cute, funny.</i>

740
00:34:05,763 --> 00:34:08,832
<i>I liked him, so I pretended
to be older.</i>

741
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:11,134
<i>He kept giving me drinks.</i>

742
00:34:11,202 --> 00:34:12,869
<i>I started to feel funny,</i>

743
00:34:12,937 --> 00:34:16,172
<i>So he asked me if I
needed to lie down.</i>

744
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,942
<i>He helped me upstairs. And the rest?</i>

745
00:34:19,009 --> 00:34:24,514
<i>Well, you're defending him now;
you know what he does.</i>

746
00:34:24,582 --> 00:34:26,883
<i>I was barely awake for any of it.</i>

747
00:34:26,951 --> 00:34:28,685
<i>All I knew the next day</i>

748
00:34:28,753 --> 00:34:32,322
<i>Was that something sick had happened to
me.</i>

749
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:35,425
<i>When I read about your case in the
papers,</i>

750
00:34:35,493 --> 00:34:38,561
<i>When I realized how many other
girls he'd done it to,</i>

751
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:41,231
<i>How maybe I could have stopped it all</i>

752
00:34:41,298 --> 00:34:44,267
<i>If I had been braver and
said something,</i>

753
00:34:44,335 --> 00:34:46,903
<i>Well, that's when all this started.</i>

754
00:34:46,971 --> 00:34:48,438
<i>I'm sorry, daddy.</i>

755
00:34:48,506 --> 00:34:50,874
<i>I should have said something to you.</i>

756
00:34:50,941 --> 00:34:52,041
(door slams)

757
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:55,578
(gasps)

758
00:34:59,984 --> 00:35:02,318
(sighs)

759
00:35:05,756 --> 00:35:07,924
(soft sob)

760
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:13,113
Allison: Sir.

761
00:35:20,188 --> 00:35:22,356
I've...

762
00:35:22,423 --> 00:35:24,458
I'm so sorry.

763
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,795
I had a dream last night,

764
00:35:28,863 --> 00:35:30,497
And in it...

765
00:35:30,565 --> 00:35:33,200
(voice breaking): I saw ev-everything.

766
00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:37,204
Now I know why you did what you did.

767
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:43,076
I'm so sorry if I was
short with you yesterday,

768
00:35:43,144 --> 00:35:46,847
So sorry about what happened to arianna...

769
00:35:46,914 --> 00:35:49,516
To you and lily.

770
00:35:49,584 --> 00:35:51,685
For everything.

771
00:35:53,721 --> 00:35:56,823
Thank you.

772
00:35:56,891 --> 00:35:59,126
It's been quite a burden.

773
00:36:00,528 --> 00:36:04,698
The hardest part has been
keeping my wife in the dark.

774
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:09,336
Unfortunately, it looks like that's...

775
00:36:09,404 --> 00:36:11,405
No longer an option.

776
00:36:15,376 --> 00:36:17,844
<i>You are gonna come forward?</i>

777
00:36:17,912 --> 00:36:19,880
I don't think I really have a choice.

778
00:36:22,283 --> 00:36:24,718
I should have put it all together sooner.

779
00:36:26,954 --> 00:36:29,589
The obituaries that he
was leaving everywhere...

780
00:36:29,657 --> 00:36:32,125
(heavy sigh)

781
00:36:32,193 --> 00:36:34,161
That's how he figured it all out--

782
00:36:34,228 --> 00:36:36,930
He must have come across one in prison

783
00:36:36,998 --> 00:36:39,599
And when he saw her picture,
imagine his surprise

784
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:41,268
When he realized that he raped

785
00:36:41,336 --> 00:36:43,203
The daughter of his own defense attorney.

786
00:36:43,271 --> 00:36:44,871
(exhales)

787
00:36:44,939 --> 00:36:46,573
I'm gonna call a press conference

788
00:36:46,641 --> 00:36:47,574
Tomorrow, late afternoon,

789
00:36:47,642 --> 00:36:50,577
Admit what I did.

790
00:36:50,645 --> 00:36:54,114
Lily's away on a trip with some friends.

791
00:36:54,182 --> 00:36:56,450
I want to speak with her first.

792
00:36:56,517 --> 00:36:58,251
After that, I'll speak with the press.

793
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:00,354
Hopefully, the fact that there's going to be

794
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:01,888
A press conference will be enough

795
00:37:01,956 --> 00:37:05,425
To keep mr. Gerwin at bay for a day.

796
00:37:08,062 --> 00:37:11,131
I'm gonna miss this place.

797
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,401
Regal man: Excuse me.

798
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:16,603
This is for you.

799
00:37:16,671 --> 00:37:20,874
Wow. You already have my, uh, $92.18?

800
00:37:20,942 --> 00:37:23,877
No, it's just what you gave me yesterday.

801
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:25,278
I can't keep it.

802
00:37:25,346 --> 00:37:26,913
I don't care what you say.

803
00:37:26,981 --> 00:37:29,082
You know, uh,

804
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,218
I've only been doing this
for a couple of weeks.

805
00:37:31,285 --> 00:37:32,552
I'm not proud of it.

806
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,688
It's just, uh, I haven't worked in a while,

807
00:37:34,756 --> 00:37:37,758
And I was hoping to get a
little bit of money coming in.

808
00:37:37,825 --> 00:37:41,495
But the truth is, your $38 was all I got,

809
00:37:41,562 --> 00:37:45,432
And, uh, I didn't set out
to swindle little girls.

810
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,100
So you're not a prince?

811
00:37:47,168 --> 00:37:49,102
(laughs softly) why are
you dressed like that?

812
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,504
Aiken: Bridgette?

813
00:37:50,571 --> 00:37:53,273
When you're done with those,
would you come help me

814
00:37:53,341 --> 00:37:55,008
In the children's section, please?

815
00:37:55,076 --> 00:37:56,209
Yeah, sure.

816
00:37:56,277 --> 00:37:57,944
Um, miss aiken,

817
00:37:58,012 --> 00:37:59,346
This is prince abantu.

818
00:37:59,414 --> 00:38:00,647
He's from nigeria.

819
00:38:00,715 --> 00:38:02,849
Nice to meet you.

820
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:04,718
Yeah, you, too.

821
00:38:06,254 --> 00:38:07,421
Bye.

822
00:38:07,488 --> 00:38:08,989
Bye-bye.

823
00:38:12,994 --> 00:38:14,961
(door opens, closes)

824
00:38:15,029 --> 00:38:16,263
Joe: Well, at least

825
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:19,466
One of the dubois women
is happy in her work.

826
00:38:19,534 --> 00:38:21,401
<i>Bridgette loves working
at the library.</i>

827
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:23,036
She doesn't even mind the fact

828
00:38:23,104 --> 00:38:25,272
That you can't really talk in there.

829
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:27,207
Will hate to see it end.

830
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:30,076
Meets all kinds of interesting people.

831
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,180
Even helped a nice young girl
set up an e-mail account.

832
00:38:33,247 --> 00:38:34,581
Hmm?

833
00:38:36,417 --> 00:38:39,753
Come on, bridgette dubois,
librarian at large?

834
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:42,489
Isn't that good for at least a smile?

835
00:38:43,658 --> 00:38:46,092
Hmm. Well, I guess not.

836
00:38:47,295 --> 00:38:49,763
Hey, come on, I mean...

837
00:38:49,831 --> 00:38:53,700
I just, I can't stand the thought of
this monster getting away with this,

838
00:38:53,768 --> 00:38:56,603
The thought of devalos
losing his job, his license.

839
00:38:56,671 --> 00:38:58,805
Look, I know he made a mistake,

840
00:38:58,873 --> 00:39:01,842
But the truth is, if that had
been one of our daughters,

841
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:03,944
I would've done the same thing.

842
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:06,246
I think he showed remarkable restraint

843
00:39:06,314 --> 00:39:09,549
In not murdering the son of a bitch.

844
00:39:21,462 --> 00:39:22,662
See? It's easy.

845
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:25,265
Now you can write
e-mails to whoever you want.

846
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:27,434
Wow. Thanks.

847
00:39:27,502 --> 00:39:29,035
You're a very smart kid.

848
00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:31,238
Yeah, well, I get that a lot.

849
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:32,672
(laughs)

850
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:35,609
Actually, can you help
me with one more thing?

851
00:39:35,676 --> 00:39:37,777
I'm not a very good typist.

852
00:39:37,845 --> 00:39:40,180
I always feel like I have ten thumbs.

853
00:39:40,248 --> 00:39:43,283
Is there any way you could
type up an e-mail for me?

854
00:39:48,422 --> 00:39:49,923
(sighs)

855
00:39:52,493 --> 00:39:55,929
Don't be upset with me.

856
00:39:55,997 --> 00:39:58,465
(whispering): Arianna...

857
00:39:58,533 --> 00:40:01,201
Arianna, what are you talking about?

858
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:03,270
What are you doing here?

859
00:40:04,472 --> 00:40:08,208
That e-mail I had your little girl type...

860
00:40:08,276 --> 00:40:11,378
It went to a crime boss named tom harper.

861
00:40:11,445 --> 00:40:14,481
William gerwin got his
parole by agreeing to testify

862
00:40:14,549 --> 00:40:16,383
In an organized crime case.

863
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,885
He sent away one of tom
harper's top lieutenants.

864
00:40:18,953 --> 00:40:22,255
Harper never knew who the snitch was.

865
00:40:22,323 --> 00:40:24,491
That is, until now.

866
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:25,959
Oh, my god, you do know

867
00:40:26,027 --> 00:40:28,395
What that man is gonna
do to gerwin, don't you?

868
00:40:28,462 --> 00:40:29,629
Absolutely.

869
00:40:29,697 --> 00:40:31,831
And by the way, he's already done it.

870
00:40:31,899 --> 00:40:35,669
Gerwin is already dead?

871
00:40:35,736 --> 00:40:38,838
It happened about an hour ago.

872
00:40:38,906 --> 00:40:42,642
That man took everything from me.

873
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,978
There's no way I could let him take

874
00:40:45,046 --> 00:40:47,447
Everything from my dad, too.

875
00:40:47,515 --> 00:40:50,750
I want what he did to remain a secret.

876
00:40:50,818 --> 00:40:53,653
Well, I'm sure it will.

877
00:40:53,721 --> 00:40:56,590
Now... Maybe...

878
00:40:56,657 --> 00:41:00,360
Maybe there's no reason
for anyone to know now.

879
00:41:00,428 --> 00:41:02,662
Good.

880
00:41:04,098 --> 00:41:07,734
But there is one person who
deserves to know the truth...

881
00:41:07,802 --> 00:41:10,971
Who needs to know the truth.

882
00:41:11,038 --> 00:41:14,641
Will you do something for me?

883
00:41:14,709 --> 00:41:18,178
Get my father to do something for me?

884
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:20,213
