1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,630
Hi, you've reached joe dubois.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,520
Please leave your name and
number and I'll call you back.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,520
Hey, honey, it's me.

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,940
Look, I stopped at one
of those super stores

5
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,130
To pick up some cleaning supplies,

6
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,770
And time kind of got away from me.

7
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,020
I was hoping I could
sell you on some chinese

8
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,060
Or some mexican tonight.

9
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,620
Little executive decision here.

10
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,880
I can't even remember
where I parked now.

11
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,730
All right, well, I'll see you soon.

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,770
I'll be the girl with the
bag or the box of food.

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,440
Hey, lady, excuse me.

14
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,700
Can you spare some
change for the bus?

15
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,540
I got to get home so I can
do homework, but I'm broke.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,040
Maybe you could lend me five bucks?

17
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,790
Lend you?

18
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,070
You just-- you give me
your name and address,

20
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,830
And I'll mail it
back to you. I swear.

21
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,930
I just don't get it.

22
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,160
Why do you need to take the bus?

23
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,680
Why don't your friends
give you a ride?

24
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:17,960
You're right.

25
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,220
For that matter,
why don't I just take your purse

26
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,780
And help myself to whatever I want.

27
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:23,480
Take it.

28
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:24,910
Wait, wait, wait,

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,840
Wait, please.

30
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,020
Listen, my little girls'
baby pictures are in there.

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,370
Can I just take them out
of my wallet, please?

32
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,550
I don't have any copies.

33
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,520
Yeah, sure.

34
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,810
And if there are any fives,
tens or 20s

35
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,150
You feel particularly attached to,

36
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,570
Maybe you should keep those, too.

37
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,890
Hey!

38
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,450
Those pictures--

39
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,100
I'm not going to ask you again.

40
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,430
You stupid, gutless

41
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,630
Punks.

42
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,030
I would have given you my purse,

43
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,810
But nobody touches my
little girls' baby pictures.

44
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,650
Ew, what's that smell?

45
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,170
That's it. That's it.

46
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,500
Take a good deep breath of that.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,390
just keep those
eyes open for a bit,

48
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,030
And I'll put away
the smelling salts.

49
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,670
What happened?

50
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,520
What's going on?
What happened to me?

51
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
You were mugged, ma'am.

52
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,960
You've been out cold for
the last ten minutes.

53
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:52,250
medium  615

54
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,660
You okay?

55
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,610
Me?

56
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,610
I'm fine.

57
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,740
I want to kill somebody,
but other than that...

58
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,370
I'm not getting any service.

59
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,910
I think I ought to duck outside.

60
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,260
I want the girls to know that
we'll be coming home soon.

61
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,340
Yeah, yeah, go.

62
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,040
I'm fine.

63
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,140
That's some shiner.

64
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,450
You mind if I ask how it happened?

65
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,600
I got mugged.

66
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,630
Waiting for an x-ray?

67
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,640
Cat scan.

68
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,400
You?

69
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,960
I broke my knuckle.

70
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,640
Same as the last two
times I was here.

71
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Wow, you broke that three times?

72
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,840
Well, it's

73
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,010
Occupational hazard.

74
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,070
I'm an instructor for a
program called prevail.

75
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,480
It's a self-defense course.

76
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,190
We teach people how to handle
themselves in sticky situations.

77
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,240
I wish I had met you last week.

78
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,370
Ms. Hudack? Yeah.

79
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,470
Here's hoping nothing like this

80
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,540
Ever happens to you again.

81
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,680
Oh, my god, mom,
what did they do to your face?

82
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,130
What, this? Honey, this is nothing.

83
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,670
You should see the other guy.

84
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,930
Shh, don't cry.

85
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,900
Ó²

86
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,740
Okay.

87
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,150
I just called all the
credit card companies,

88
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,170
And I canceled everything.

89
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,560
Oh, great, they
didn't get your keys.

90
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:56,800
Here.

91
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,630
Okay, so I'll take
ariel with me tomorrow,

92
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,650
And I'll go pick up your car.

93
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,070
That's great.

94
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,010
Except I still can't remember
where I actually parked.

95
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,190
Well, that's all right.

96
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,040
I also called devalos while
you were in your cat scan.

97
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,560
I told him that you needed rest.

98
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,790
You weren't coming
into work tomorrow.

99
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,700
Wait a second... No, allison.

100
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,000
The doctor said you needed rest.

101
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,130
I say you need rest.

102
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,310
Phoenix can do without
its psychic for one day.

103
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,900
Did you hear that?

104
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,640
Joe?

105
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,870
Joe, did you hear that?

106
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,030
joe, what are you doing?

107
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,000
I haven't been able to get you
out of my mind, sweet thing.

108
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,100
I got your address on
your driver's license.

109
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,260
Thought I'd come by and get
to know you a little better.

110
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,910
It's not a martial arts class.

111
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,920
I mean, we teach average people
how to do things anybody can do.

112
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,820
We train you how to
avoid confrontation,

113
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,830
But also, you know, what to do
if you find yourself in one.

114
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,860
Every day at work,
I see the most horrible things.

115
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,220
I see torture, mutilation, death.

116
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,160
You'd think nothing
would get to me.

117
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,510
Ever since this kid hit me,
something has changed.

118
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,610
I just don't feel like the
ground that I'm walking on

119
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,430
Is as solid as it used to be.

120
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,090
You know, it's going to
continue to feel like that

121
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,620
Until you can convince yourself

122
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,300
That the world is a
manageable place again.

123
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,710
I know what it's like.

124
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,240
And if it hadn't been for prevail,

125
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,040
I'm sure I'd still be dwelling
on what happened to me.

126
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:12,860
Six years ago,

127
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,230
I was coming home from the gym,

128
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,520
And there was a man
in my apartment.

129
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,100
The police said he got
in through a window.

130
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,290
He was just... Sitting there,

131
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,340
Waiting for me.

132
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,310
He grabbed me while I was
looking through a stack of mail.

133
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,630
He... Beat me until
I could barely move.

134
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,780
He broke all my ribs.

135
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,110
He broke one of my arms,
my cheekbone.

136
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,390
And then he raped me.

137
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,800
Three times.

138
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,310
When he was done, he just left.

139
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,870
I don't know, I think
he thought I was dead.

140
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,050
It all happened so fast,
it was like...

141
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,100
He was on me, he was hitting me,

142
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,040
And then my eyes were swollen shut

143
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,820
Before I even saw
what he looked like.

144
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,120
Anyway, I...

145
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,640
I walked around with this
feeling you're describing...

146
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,330
For a really long time.

147
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,310
And then I found this place.

148
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,020
I want you to feel the ground
underneath your feet again,

149
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,940
And I think we can help.

150
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,670
You wanted to see me?

151
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,680
Yeah, lee, come on in.

152
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,560
Take a look.

153
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,820
What's this?

154
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,870
These are still
frames from a video.

155
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,010
The man wearing the mask

156
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,150
Is raping the girl.

157
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,490
She's 15. Her name is kate hatton.

158
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,350
She used a fake I.D.
To get into a bar.

159
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,610
Somebody spiked her drink.

160
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,410
She woke up the next
day in the alley

161
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,700
And realized that she'd
been sexually assaulted,

162
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,530
But she couldn't
describe her assailant.

163
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,530
And there was no dna
evidence recovered.

164
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,800
Then we found this video

165
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,770
Right there on the internet.

166
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,870
Wait a second.

167
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,120
This guy raped a teenage girl,
videoed it and then posted it?

168
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:05,840
Yeah.

169
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,890
We blew some of these images up--

170
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,090
Looking for anything that might
help us identify this guy.

171
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,850
Compared that to what was in
the sex offenders registry.

172
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,330
We thought we had a match,

173
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,280
And then we realized
that video alone

174
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,730
Would be inconclusive in court.

175
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,190
So, I got a detective

176
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,850
From vice, had him go undercover.

177
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,670
Made up a phony name.

178
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,540
Put him in the sex
offenders registry,

179
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,210
Posing as a child
molester on parole.

180
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,500
Henry maynard-- he called himself.

181
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,040
We got him into the same

182
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,460
Court-ordered therapy
group as the suspect,

183
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,850
Hoping that he would
get close enough,

184
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,270
And the suspect would
confide in him.

185
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,580
Give him some details of the crime.

186
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,600
Something we could
use in court, or...

187
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,590
And?

188
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,220
And our made-up henry
maynard hasn't checked in

189
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,180
In over a week.

190
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,360
You're thinking our
masked man figured out

191
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,050
There's an undercover
cop on his tail?

192
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,480
All we know is

193
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,900
Is that he approached the suspect,

194
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,710
The investigation was proceeding,

195
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,310
And then he just vanished.

196
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,640
Tell me what I can do to help.

197
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:10,820
Well, that's just it.

198
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:15,810
I don't want your help.

199
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,870
I called you in here
'cause you're a friend.

200
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,480
I called you in here
to give you a heads-up.

201
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:21,900
This is a case

202
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,890
You cannot be involved in, lee.

203
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,920
This is a case you've
got to stay away from.

204
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,620
I'm sorry.

205
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,160
Take a look at the pictures again.

206
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,700
The suspect has been
convicted twice before

207
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,820
Of rape, one time against a minor.

208
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,210
Been out of prison
nearly three years now.

209
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,820
I'm almost certain
that's your brother.

210
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,090
I'm confused. I thought your
brother was living in oregon.

211
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,140
Well, he's not;
he's back in phoenix.

212
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,530
And I guess he's been here awhile.

213
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,850
Nice for him to tell me, right?

214
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,350
As far as whether not
that's him in that video,

215
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,050
I can't even wrap
my brain around it.

216
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,690
Now they're talking like maybe
he killed this detective,

217
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,140
This... Henry maynard guy,
or whatever his real name is.

218
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,430
I think I'll go talk to him.

219
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,220
; lee...

220
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,290
Leigh.

221
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,590
It's weird.

222
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,770
When I think about him,
all I remember is

223
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,510
A older brother that
kept my drunken father

224
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,100
From beating the crap out of me.

225
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,240
Growing up, he wouldn't hurt a fly.

226
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,820
I don't even know him anymore.

227
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,480
Hey, bo.

228
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,580
Mr. Good.

229
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,480
So I heard a rumor--

230
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,640
I'm a uncle now.

231
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,540
Had a little girl last August.

232
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,510
Name's leigh.

233
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,490
Uh-huh.

234
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,540
Me and the mom are engaged.

235
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,880
Well, that's good, mr. Good.

236
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,000
That's terrific, man.

237
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,220
You got any pictures or...?

238
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,290
Well, maybe I can
meet her sometime.

239
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,930
Look, lee... Here's the thing, man.

240
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,020
I'm not like I used to be.

241
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,110
Prison... It beats
the bad out of you.

242
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,270
And any little bit of bad
that they didn't get,

243
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,590
The parole system takes care of.

244
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,860
They got me in group,
five days a week now.

245
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,070
That's good, paul.

246
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,370
The stuff with the girls--

247
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,900
I'm on all the databases now,

248
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,900
And I got the brand on me:
"Sex offender,"

249
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,030
But I'm not... Some pervert.

250
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,350
It was about anger.

251
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,890
I was just mad all the time.

252
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,300
I don't know if it
was 'cause of dad,

253
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,840
Or maybe it was just the way
I was wired. I don't know.

254
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,980
I'm 50 years old now, man.

255
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,210
I'm a different guy.

256
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,020
I think I finally got a
handle on everything.

257
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,420
You say so.

258
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,190
What's that mean?

259
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,680
I don't know,
you sneaked back into town,

260
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,420
You know about me,
I don't know about you.

261
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,200
I was trying to get
on my feet, man.

262
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,250
Maybe get a nicer place before
I saw my little brother,

263
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,230
Met my new niece.

264
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,100
So hard to understand?

265
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,510
No.

266
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,410
I gotta ask you a question, paul.

267
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,190
You ask me anything you want,
mr. Good.

268
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,340
I'll give you a straight answer.

269
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,440
You ever met a guy
named henry maynard?

270
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,070
So that's what you're
doing here, huh?

271
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,370
Checking on someone in
the perv posse, huh?

272
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:23,210
Yeah, I know, uh, I know henry.

273
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,480
I see him at my 12-step meetings.

274
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,810
He seems... He seems
like an okay guy.

275
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,100
Why, is he in some sort of trouble?

276
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,660
You seen him lately?

277
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,110
Last week, maybe.

278
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,530
He's kind of fallen off the radar.

279
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,100
His parole officer's getting
a little hysterical.

280
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,610
You run into him,
you ask him to give me a call?

281
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,480
Yeah, sure.

282
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,490
I'll tell him to call
my brother, the cop.

283
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,850
No problem.

284
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,800
Get him! Get him! Strike!
Strike! Strike! Strike!

285
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,940
Hmm, I guess that's why
they call it "Prevail."

286
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,450
Just do me a favor.

287
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,370
If I come up behind
you to give you a hug,

288
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,420
Try not to karate-chop
me in the face.

289
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,930
Kah! Kor! Hah!

290
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,350
Play at your own risk.

291
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,280
Hey, you know,
if it makes you feel better,

292
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,830
They've got some classes for men.

293
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,460
Isn't there some kind
of law against that?

294
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,550
"One trained fighter per family"?

295
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,380
No, the more the merrier.

296
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,780
As far as I'm concerned,
somebody messes with a dubois,

297
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,160
We can just tag-team him.

298
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:42,950
What?

299
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,330
Oh, you're smiling again,
you're joking again.

300
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,100
Seems like you got
your confidence back.

301
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,960
Something about this
woman in this class.

302
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,980
I don't know what it is.

303
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,880
It kind of gives me hope.

304
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:56,880
I don't know.

305
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,030
Maybe when I start the class,

306
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,790
I'll think it's stupid,
or I'll be terrible at it.

307
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,690
At least I'm doing something.

308
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,310
Stop it! Stop fighting.

309
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:19,970
Listen to me!

310
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
This is only gonna get
worse if you keep fighting!

311
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,460
Isn't the idea to
keep the splint on

312
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,900
Until it stops hurting?

313
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,370
Yeah, you caught me.

314
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,540
The doctors told me to
keep it on for two weeks,

315
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,030
But I don't know.

316
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,390
I guess I'm just not happy
unless I'm hitting something.

317
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,260
So what brings you by?

318
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,500
Your class doesn't
start till next week.

319
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,280
I found the man who attacked you.

320
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,870
What?

321
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,580
How?

322
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,240
The "How's" Not important.

323
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,890
What is important is,
I was able to go into work,

324
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,620
And I was able to find him

325
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,320
On the phoenix sex
offender registry.

326
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,310
Turns out, this guy has a
history of sexual assault.

327
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,940
Four years ago, he was convicted
of raping a 15-year-old girl.

328
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,230
And they caught him, but he was
just paroled a few months ago.

329
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,780
Turns out, he lives about
five miles from here.

330
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,140
That's him, isn't it?

331
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,940
That's the man who raped you.

332
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,560
Uh, I don't know.

333
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,990
I don't, I don't think so.

334
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,870
It all happened so fast,
I never really got a good look at him.

335
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,700
Ar-are you sure?

336
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,350
Maybe you just blocked it out.

337
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,970
Have another look at his picture.

338
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,220
I haven't blocked out anything.

339
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,580
I was raped and left
for dead, allison.

340
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,280
Trust me,I remember every
detail of what happened.

341
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,420
And I know that I never really saw

342
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,140
The man who did it.

343
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,470
Kira, we could send
this man back to prison.

344
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,820
I know this is traumatic for you.

345
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,120
It's not traumatic for me.

346
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,230
It's annoying.

347
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,250
You're wrong.

348
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,560
You weren't there, I was.

349
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,210
This man might be all the
things you say he is,

350
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,250
But I can't tell you

351
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,490
That that's the man
that attacked me.

352
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,190
Class is next Tuesday.

353
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,080
I hope to see you there.

354
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,300
Believe it or not, allison,

355
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,310
I got a full caseload.

356
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,840
I don't really have time to reopen

357
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,180
A six-year-old rape case,

358
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,430
Where the victim can't make an I.D.

359
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,530
Maybe we don't need a positive I.D.

360
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,740
If they did a rape kit,

361
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,910
Maybe we can convict this
guy on physical evidence.

362
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,190
I saw it, lee. I saw it.

363
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,880
I-I saw where he is,
I saw who he is.

364
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,000
This is him? This is your rapist?

365
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,100
Henry maynard,
he's a serial sex offender.

366
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,740
No, actually, he's a cop.

367
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,500
What?

368
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,400
Henry maynard isn't
even his real name.

369
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,130
It's an alias.

370
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,050
He's sean riley.

371
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,310
He's been working undercover
as a sex offender.

372
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,380
That's why he's got a
profile on the registry.

373
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,250
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
allison,

374
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,820
But this guy didn't rape anybody.

375
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,730
Go away.

376
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,900
I just want to remind you

377
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,860
There's no lifeguard
on duty after 11:00.

378
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,690
Are you falling asleep in there?

379
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,200
'cause I'm falling asleep out here.

380
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,560
Hey, here's a crazy idea:
Let's go to bed,

381
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,620
But let's do it in bed.

382
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,630
Go ahead. No one's stopping you.

383
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,630
Go to bed.

384
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,910
Are those scented candles?

385
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,300
What's that scent called,
"Self-pity"?

386
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,190
it's close. "Self-loathing."

387
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,880
I hate that smell on you.

388
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,140
Well, we're both stuck
with it for a while.

389
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,400
Any particular reason?

390
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,980
What, you want to hear
about my day? Huh?

391
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,930
Well, I went to see a
woman who'd been raped,

392
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,220
And I tried to convince her I
knew more about it than she did.

393
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,150
Nice.

394
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,420
Yeah, well, to top it off,
I went to go see lee,

395
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,070
And I identified a decorated
police officer as a rapist.

396
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,920
Jeez, now I hate you, too.

397
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,900
Allison, you have a concussion,

398
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,280
And I'm betting this kira
person understands that,

399
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,520
And I'm sure detective
scanlon does, too.

400
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,080
You should have seen me running
into that police station

401
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,860
Like I'd cracked this major case.

402
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,450
God, if I only knew
all the awful things

403
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,180
Lee was going through
with his brother...

404
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,970
Before this afternoon,
did you even know he had a brother?

405
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,700
Just give me ten more minutes.

406
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,920
Allison called this morning.

407
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,560
About an hour ago,
we found him in a shallow grave

408
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,930
Just beyond the perimeter
of sky harbor airport.

409
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,890
According to the medical examiner,

410
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,630
His jaw's broken in three places.

411
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,350
ribs are shattered.

412
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,730
His skull's fractured.

413
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,670
She thinks whoever did
this took their time.

414
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,520
She thinks whoever did this
took some pleasure in it.

415
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:32,630
What's this?

416
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,560
Stun gun burns.

417
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,690
Working theory is, the killer
came up behind him, stunned him,

418
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,980
Then beat him to death.

419
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,590
Lee, I need you to understand

420
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,820
That now that detective riley's
cover is no longer an issue,

421
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,700
I need to act.

422
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,390
I'm going to bring in your
brother for questioning.

423
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,250
Where am I?

424
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,820
Excuse me?

425
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,950
I want to be there
when you question him.

426
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,150
Lee...

427
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,500
I'm not talking about
running the interview.

428
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,460
I just... I need to be able

429
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,840
To see him when you talk to him.

430
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,300
I can be in the observation room.

431
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,910
I got to know if he tells you
the same story he told me.

432
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,110
What do you mean,
the same story that he told you?

433
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,810
I went to his apartment.

434
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,320
I asked him if he
knew henry maynard.

435
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,360
He told me he just met him.
He didn't seem alarmed.

436
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,720
He didn't startle at the question.

437
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,340
He sure as hell didn't act
like he knew he was a cop.

438
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,690
Now, for what it's worth,
I believed him.

439
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,330
I told you to stay out of this.

440
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,410
Manny, you don't understand.
This is my big brother.

441
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,360
If I was wrong about him,
if he did this to a cop,

442
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,300
I need to be there.

443
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,050
I'm sorry. I don't...

444
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,640
I don't... I don't think I've
ever seen this girl before.

445
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,600
Her name is kate hatton.

446
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,950
Oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry,
but none of this is familiar to me.

447
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:53,660
Really?

448
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,170
Why don't you take a closer look,

449
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,290
Mr. Scanlon, because I'm pretty
sure you know who that girl is,

450
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,140
And I'm almost certain
you know who the man is.

451
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,970
One more look, please.

452
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,240
I'm sorry, I...

453
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,690
You don't recognize the tattoo?

454
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,260
On who?

455
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,170
On him.

456
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,220
On you.

457
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,180
On me?

458
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,110
You think this is me 'cause of...
'cause of that tattoo?

459
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,510
Are you denying that you have one

460
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,950
Exactly like it on your right arm?

461
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,930
That tattoo?

462
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,320
There's a million guys
that got that tattoo.

463
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,850
Look, I don't, I don't...

464
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,240
I don't know who this guy is,
but it's not me.

465
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,800
I've never seen that girl before.

466
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,950
I've never been to this place,

467
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,150
Wherever it is,
or wore a mask like that.

468
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,300
You know, maybe you guys

469
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,570
Just, uh...

470
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,790
Want to pin this on a felon.

471
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,570
Well, you can forget about that.

472
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,790
I had nothing to do with this.

473
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,050
Ever seen him?

474
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,300
Sure.

475
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,250
That's, uh, that's henry.

476
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,150
Now, you want to talk about a guy

477
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,580
Who's capable of doing
something like that...

478
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,470
Mr. Scanlon, henry's
real name is sean riley.

479
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,900
Detective sean riley.

480
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,390
He's an undercover officer I
assigned to get close to you.

481
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,120
Detective riley's body

482
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,340
Was found near the
airport earlier today.

483
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,740
He was beaten to death.

484
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,020
Did he say something that
alerted you to the fact

485
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,390
That he wasn't who he said he was?

486
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,390
You think I had something
to do with killing a cop?

487
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,580
My own brother's a cop.

488
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:43,050
In fact, the other night,
he was asking me...

489
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,470
About the same guy.

490
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,430
Oh, man.

491
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,980
Oh, man.

492
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,260
He knew about this, didn't he?

493
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,680
That you were trying to...

494
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,970
Pin me for what
happened to this girl.

495
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,600
Your brother has never
had anything to do

496
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,960
With this investigation, sir.

497
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,450
He's out there right now, isn't he?

498
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:12,600
Hey!

499
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,700
Hey, mr. Good!

500
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:17,960
You're looking at me.

501
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:19,900
Aren't you?

502
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,250
What's the matter with you?

503
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,680
I told you

504
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,610
I'd changed!

505
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,030
Hey! What? You didn't believe me,
baby brother?

506
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,010
Couldn't convince your friends here

507
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,300
They're after the wrong guy?

508
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:07,080
Mr. Scanlon, I need you to
return to your seat now.

509
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,380
Your brother's not out there.

510
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,370
Thanks for all your help, mr. Good.

511
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,300
Great to know you were there
for me when I needed you.

512
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,890
All right, mr. Scanlon.

513
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,250
I need you to return to your seat.

514
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:22,890
So, what's the verdict?

515
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,510
Um, well, yeah.

516
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,980
It's, it's good, I guess.

517
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,530
I mean, he, uh...

518
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,690
They-they can't keep him.

519
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,350
They can't prove anything.

520
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:38,030
He-he just kept saying he
didn't do it, any of it.

521
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,410
What do you say?

522
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,180
You know, after that beating
I took the other night,

523
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,510
I still have a concussion.

524
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,010
Hey. Tell me what you saw.

525
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,760
Did he kill him? Did my
brother kill that detective?

526
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,490
I didn't see that.

527
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,120
What about the girl?
Did you see him with the girl?

528
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,390
That's my brother in
that video, right?

529
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:25,990
Hey.

530
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:27,900
My baby brother.

531
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,030
Big, brave police guy.

532
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:31,970
What you doing?

533
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,620
Shouldn't you be hiding
behind a one-way mirror?

534
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,760
Now, you look me in the eye
and tell me what's going on.

535
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,690
What's going on with what?

536
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:44,760
Did you rape that girl?

537
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,500
No!

538
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:46,760
Did you kill that detective?

539
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,390
Oh, for god sakes, no.
Put that gun away.

540
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,410
You raped her, didn't you,
you fat weasel?

541
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,590
And when you realized that
cop was on your trail,

542
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,870
You beat him to death, didn't you?

543
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,070
Didn't you?!

544
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,420
Damn it, lee. Look at me.

545
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,940
I'm your brother.
I'm your flesh and blood.

546
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,270
I'm looking you right in the eye.

547
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,070
I didn't do it. Any of it.

548
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,060
I swear to god.

549
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,150
I went to prison,
lee, for nine years.

550
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,980
When I got out,
I made a promise to myself

551
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,980
That I would never,
ever hurt another person.

552
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:16,100
I would never, ever force
myself on another human being.

553
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,930
And I swear to god, I haven't.

554
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,680
Go ahead, shoot.

555
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,560
It'd be a relief.

556
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,620
But I didn't do it, lee.

557
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,240
Know why I came back to phoenix,
baby brother?

558
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,730
'cause I heard you had that kid.

559
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,350
I've been alone all my life, lee.
I got nothing.

560
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,390
And I just thought maybe,
you know...

561
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:08,350
Maybe I could get a little
something of what you have.

562
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,490
Stupid, right?

563
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,260
Not stupid.

564
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:25,960
It's not stupid.

565
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,360
You're awake.

566
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:13,790
That's good.

567
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,170
I guess we can get started.

568
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,510
You're scared, right?

569
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,880
You're wondering who I am?

570
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:22,870
Why I'm doing this to you?

571
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,330
After all, you've
never seen me before.

572
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,230
You don't know me at all.

573
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:34,230
But I know you... Henry maynard.

574
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,020
You've got the wrong person.

575
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,250
Read all about you on
my favorite web site.

576
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,810
You raped a 15-year-old girl.

577
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,800
No.

578
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,840
I'm not gonna lie to you, henry.

579
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,060
You're going to die tonight.

580
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,130
I'm going to kill you.

581
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,290
But first...

582
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,800
I'm going to teach you
what it really means

583
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,110
To be a victim.

584
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,430
Stop it! Stop fighting.

585
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:18,830
Listen to me.

586
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,160
This is only gonna get
worse if you keep fighting.

587
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,010
Stop fighting?

588
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,080
That's a good one, henry.

589
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,880
It still hurt?

590
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:40,660
I can deal with it.

591
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,470
What's this?

592
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,500
More sex offenders you
think may have hurt me?

593
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,050
Or vice versa.

594
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,020
All these men have
dropped out of sight,

595
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,110
Stopped checking in with
their parole officers.

596
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,980
Those men are never
gonna show up, are they?

597
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,260
You made sure of that, didn't you?

598
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,860
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

599
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:07,620
Well, this last man

600
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,310
That you murdered, henry maynard...

601
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,940
Not a sex offender.

602
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:13,940
Not really.

603
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,000
He was an undercover

604
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,270
Vice detective.

605
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,570
He was somebody's husband,
he was somebody's father.

606
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,930
What, you didn't... You didn't know

607
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,450
That the... The police
put up fake histories

608
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,040
For their undercover
officers on the sex registry?

609
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:30,960
Well, they do.

610
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,410
One last time--

611
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,240
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

612
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,190
Hey, guys.

613
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:47,900
So what happens now?

614
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,870
You gonna arrest me?

615
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,510
By yourself?

616
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,710
Yeah, I didn't think so.

617
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,400
That would require proof,

618
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,780
That would require muscle--

619
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,970
Neither of which you have.

620
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,010
You coming to class?

621
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,920
I'm gonna pass.

622
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:30,780
Nice.

623
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,040
It's quiet.

624
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,870
Where's, uh... Where's your fianc?

625
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:41,760
Where's the...

626
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,950
Where's the baby?

627
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,240
I thought we were all, uh...

628
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,000
All having dinner together.

629
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:46,900
I sent them away.

630
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,670
You know what I did today?

631
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,980
I watched that video of the
teenage girl getting raped.

632
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,290
Oh, man.

633
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,770
Wh-why would you do that?

634
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,370
'cause my big brother
told me it wasn't him.

635
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,970
I figured the quicker I
figure out who it really was,

636
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,590
The quicker you could
get on with your life

637
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,880
Without everybody looking
over your shoulder.

638
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:23,370
The guy in that video,
he had that girl on the bed.

639
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,690
Kind of hesitated before
he got down to business,

640
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,770
Like he was nervous.

641
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,430
He just stood there
looking down at her,

642
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,230
Bending his thumb back.

643
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,630
He kept bending his thumb
back all the way to his wrist.

644
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,370
Guess the guy was double-jointed.

645
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,670
And it made me think of you, paul.

646
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,130
You're double-jointed.

647
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,450
Well, a lot of guys
are double-jointed.

648
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,740
No, no, I know, but I don't
know them; I know you.

649
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,600
And I remember how back
when dad used to get drunk

650
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,870
And raring to hit someone,
you'd just lay there on your bed

651
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,590
Bending your thumb back
over and over again.

652
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,020
You shouldn't have
watched that video.

653
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,370
I don't know why

654
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,760
You'd want something
like that in your head.

655
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,540
One-time offer.

656
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,430
Ride down to the station with me.

657
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,290
Admit what you did.
I will stand by you.

658
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,000
Really?

659
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,000
You're going to stand by me?

660
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,850
You gonna go to prison with me?

661
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,220
I'll get you help.

662
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,940
Whatever you need to get better.

663
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,520
You don't get it, mr. Good, do you?

664
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,720
I don't need help.

665
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,570
I don't want help.

666
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,130
I'm fine.

667
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,020
I like me.

668
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,410
All the cops and the social workers

669
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,430
And the parole officers.

670
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,970
You know, all that, all that system

671
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,080
That you couldn't wait to
sign up to be a part of?

672
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,960
You guys all had your
crack at helping me.

673
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,320
It didn't take.

674
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,310
'cause there's
nothing really wrong.

675
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,160
I'm just... Like... You.

676
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,060
But I'll tell you...

677
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,970
I'll tell you something,
baby brother.

678
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,160
you want me to...

679
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,880
You want to take me downtown,
baby brother?

680
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:43,070
Hmm? Want to charge me with,
um, with what?

681
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,520
Being double-jointed?

682
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:48,840
I'll stand by you.

683
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:54,880
No?

684
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,830
Well, I'll tell you what.

685
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,460
If you change your mind...

686
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,030
...You know where I live.

687
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,790
Looks like you want to
say something to me.

688
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,360
I don't blame you.

689
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,160
I'd do the same
thing in your shoes.

690
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,750
I got it all wrong, right?

691
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,330
You're really a good guy.

692
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,460
I've heard it all before.

693
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:33,560
All of it.

694
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,050
You deserve this.

695
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,490
You know that.

696
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:45,430
Try to accept it with
some kind of dignity.

697
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,860
Hey, allison.

698
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:03,860
Look, lee. I know we
didn't have enough evidence

699
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,670
To bring in that woman
kira for questioning.

700
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,160
But please, please tell me
that you meant it when you said

701
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,950
You were going to have
somebody watching her.

702
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,480
Uh, yeah, we got a night shift
detective on her right now.

703
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,180
Why?

704
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,090
She's going after your brother.

705
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:18,630
What?

706
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,920
I just saw it, lee.

707
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,020
I saw it, um...

708
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,610
I don't know when
it's going to happen,

709
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,750
But I think it's
going to happen soon.

710
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:27,070
She-she has a broken knuckle,

711
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,460
And she still had it in my dream.

712
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,360
Um, okay. We've got
it covered, allison.

713
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,130
If kira goes after paul,
we'll pick her up.

714
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,060
Thanks for the heads-up, though.

715
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,010
Hi. What are you doing here?

716
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,360
I still have another,
uh, two hours.

717
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,010
I couldn't sleep.

718
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,940
Figured there's no point
in us both suffering.

719
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,540
You serious?

720
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,160
I'm here, right?

721
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,420
You're relieved.
Go home. Eat. Sleep.

722
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,880
Copy that, detective.

723
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,710
Much obliged.

724
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:20,770
See ya.

725
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,390
Scanlon : What's up?

726
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,710
Allison : Lee.

727
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,190
I just couldn't sleep.

728
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,080
Please just tell me
everything's all right with you.

729
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:25,790
Paul's dead, allison.

730
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:27,370
What?

731
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,860
We picked that woman up on her
way out of my brother's place.

732
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,100
She got to him before
we could stop her.

733
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:35,440
I guess our guy must have
gotten distracted or something.

734
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:40,890
They were, uh,
too late to help my brother.

735
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:42,270
Oh, my god.

736
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,020
The good news is,
we had her dead to rights.

737
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,030
She's going away for a long time.

738
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,460
I'm so sorry, lee.

739
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:51,970
Yeah. Me, too.

740
00:42:51,971 --> 00:43:01,971
