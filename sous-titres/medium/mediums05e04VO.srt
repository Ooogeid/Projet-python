1
00:00:00,622 --> 00:00:01,622
Got it.

2
00:00:02,022 --> 00:00:04,986
15-and-a-half.
You're 15-and-a-half. Okay.

3
00:00:05,567 --> 00:00:07,009
Honey, you know what?

4
00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:10,727
I am still at the supermarket
and it's 5:30.

5
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,797
If I don't get off the phone
and get these groceries in the car,

6
00:00:13,922 --> 00:00:15,725
daddy's going to beat me home.

7
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:19,172
I promise.
We'll talk about it tonight.

8
00:01:05,622 --> 00:01:07,260
- Hello?
- Allison.

9
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:10,152
Are you all right? Where are you?
Where've you been?

10
00:01:11,225 --> 00:01:13,425
I'm okay, I think.
My head hurts.

11
00:01:14,832 --> 00:01:16,492
My whole body hurts.

12
00:01:16,897 --> 00:01:18,869
- Is that Mom? Is she okay?
- Where are you?

13
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:21,009
I don't know.

14
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,940
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

15
00:01:24,822 --> 00:01:26,653
<i>I hear a freeway over my head.</i>

16
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,001
<i>There's a street sign.
It says "181st Street."</i>

17
00:01:30,126 --> 00:01:32,367
Stay right there.
I'm going to come and get you.

18
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,552
I call the police
and tell them I found you.

19
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,721
You called the police?

20
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:41,020
Allison, you've been missing
for six hours. What happened to you?

21
00:01:43,805 --> 00:01:45,055
I have no idea.

22
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,586
www.sub-way.fr
www.seriessub.com

23
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,616
Okay, follow my finger.

24
00:02:36,388 --> 00:02:38,490
Can you tell me
the last thing you remember?

25
00:02:39,147 --> 00:02:41,377
I don't know.
I was leaving the supermarket.

26
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:43,858
I was talking to my eldest
daughter on the phone.

27
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:46,916
Let's start with the good news.
There's no evidence of a concussion.

28
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,500
No sign of sexual assault.

29
00:02:48,932 --> 00:02:50,765
But she lost six hours of her life.

30
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,432
She can't remember anything before
waking up in the middle of 181st Street.

31
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:56,342
I understand, Mr. Dubois,
but I'm guessing

32
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,678
something fairly traumatic happened
at the time that she can't account for.

33
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:03,556
And now the mind is doing
what it can to block out, or suppress,

34
00:03:03,885 --> 00:03:06,852
those unpleasant memory.
That's what it's built to do.

35
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,188
So, what do we do now?

36
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,844
Whatever happened tonight,
it'll come back to you eventually.

37
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:17,152
There's nothing to deal
with until it does.

38
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:20,233
Do you think the police
will find the car?

39
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,069
I don't know.

40
00:03:22,815 --> 00:03:23,965
I don't care.

41
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,030
I found you.

42
00:03:29,102 --> 00:03:30,702
Anything after that...

43
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,149
These are for you.

44
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,742
Pancakes?
I have a bump on my head.

45
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:42,304
You didn't have to.

46
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,517
We missed you
and we were scared for you.

47
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,398
And we just wanted to make
you something special.

48
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:51,075
So you got Daddy
to make me pancakes?

49
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,798
It was the least we could do.

50
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,110
So how does it feel?
The bump, I mean.

51
00:03:56,473 --> 00:03:59,901
Not great,
but nothing that a pancake can't cure.

52
00:04:00,965 --> 00:04:02,291
What do you got there?

53
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,906
Remember what I was telling you about
yesterday? About turning 15-and-a-half?

54
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:08,319
What is it?

55
00:04:08,554 --> 00:04:10,583
It's an application
for my learner's permit.

56
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:13,669
- I need you and Dad to sign it.
- Wait a second.

57
00:04:13,965 --> 00:04:15,936
There's got to be
some kind of mistake.

58
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:18,210
Didn't I just take
the training wheels off your bike?

59
00:04:18,335 --> 00:04:20,759
Didn't you just learn
to ride a two-wheeler?

60
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:24,074
Can't believe my baby's actually
old enough to get behind the wheel.

61
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,894
Wait. You mean,

62
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,935
Ariel's gonna drive? Like, a car?

63
00:04:32,123 --> 00:04:34,320
Here you sign this.
I'll get the door.

64
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:43,474
Good morning to you, too.
Would you like a cup of coffee?

65
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,535
We talked to everybody we could find
at the supermarket, no witnesses.

66
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,203
Nobody saw anything.

67
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:50,623
And they would've had to, right?
It was still daylight.

68
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,268
Makes no sense.

69
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:54,586
Notwithstanding the fact
that you remember nothing

70
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,531
from the time
you approached your car,

71
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:59,714
we think the attack must have happened
after you left that parking lot.

72
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:01,577
But why would anyone attack me?

73
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:05,262
It's not like I was carrying a lot of
money. It's not like I have a fancy car.

74
00:05:05,507 --> 00:05:07,057
Crime of opportunity?

75
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,687
Some addict need a couple
bucks and a ride to his dealer.

76
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:12,090
You were at a traffic light.
I'm just guessing.

77
00:05:12,215 --> 00:05:13,919
We've got an APB out on your car,

78
00:05:14,044 --> 00:05:17,489
your bank's checking your credit cards
to see if anybody used them last night.

79
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,615
Beyond that,
until you remember something...

80
00:05:22,585 --> 00:05:24,907
That's quite a conking
you took on your noggin.

81
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,909
If it were me, I'd stay home.

82
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,966
I don't have a car
at the moment, so...

83
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:31,332
I guess that's the plan,
whether I like it or not.

84
00:05:31,656 --> 00:05:33,805
Though I have plenty
to keep me busy.

85
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,870
My wallet being stolen,
I've got to get

86
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:37,920
a new driver's license,
new credit cards...

87
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:42,966
Hold on,
I want to show you something.

88
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:47,768
It's not my handwriting. I don't know
where it came from, what it means.

89
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:50,690
"1927 Hennepin." It should
be easy enough to check out.

90
00:05:50,815 --> 00:05:52,975
Girls,
we're leaving in five minutes!

91
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,500
Is Ariel driving?!

92
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:56,339
Don't ask.

93
00:06:16,653 --> 00:06:17,655
Hello?

94
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,046
If I sent a squad car around for you,
would you meet me at the morgue?

95
00:06:21,993 --> 00:06:24,257
Hit and run.
Happened sometime last night.

96
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:30,285
Ask me where.

97
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:33,055
Where?

98
00:06:33,574 --> 00:06:36,519
That address you gave me,
1927 Hennepin.

99
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,648
Name's Diego Molina,
undocumented alien.

100
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:43,024
That lumberyard down the street said

101
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:45,738
they used him as a day laborer
from time to time.

102
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:50,511
You don't remember yet how that paper
came to be in your pocket, do you?

103
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:53,244
No, I wish I did.

104
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:57,106
I'm completely baffled, Lee.

105
00:06:57,421 --> 00:07:00,652
It was just... it was there
when I came to on the sidewalk.

106
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:03,666
You're not going to believe this,

107
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,849
but I found myself
getting very excited today

108
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:10,095
about the prospect of
teaching our eldest how to drive.

109
00:07:10,343 --> 00:07:11,346
That stings.

110
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,766
You'll get over it.

111
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,767
Tell you what, you can teach Bridgette
how to drive when she's old enough.

112
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:19,855
I'm not talking about that but about
that goo you're pressing on my forehead.

113
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,567
- You're pushing too hard, it stings.
- Sorry.

114
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:25,075
And I'm afraid bandage wise,

115
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,280
all we have in the house
is SpongeBob.

116
00:07:28,463 --> 00:07:30,323
- Are you kidding?
- No, I know.

117
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:33,369
You'd like a Kim Possible bandage,
but we're all out.

118
00:07:34,776 --> 00:07:36,426
So you're okay with it?

119
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:40,123
- With what?
- If I take her driving first?

120
00:07:40,831 --> 00:07:43,462
I guess so.
I don't even have a car at the moment.

121
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:46,509
It's just there's something
about it, you know,

122
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:49,671
a father teaching his kid
how to drive.

123
00:07:51,455 --> 00:07:55,434
I let you have the birds and the bees
and all of that female hygiene stuff.

124
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,459
- You let me have that?
- You know what I mean.

125
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:01,856
If there's been something
you've been dying to tell her about...

126
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,087
I don't know,
pads or flow or bloating...

127
00:08:05,212 --> 00:08:07,805
- You're playing dirty now.
- I'm sure she'd love to hear from you,

128
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,424
- given your vast experience.
- Okay. I'm going to sleep now.

129
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:15,965
Maybe I could do a little studying up
and teach one of the young'uns about

130
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,856
how there's different
peddles on the car,

131
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:20,211
and one makes one go,
one makes one stop.

132
00:08:20,336 --> 00:08:23,233
- Good night now.
- You know, a mom can always dream.

133
00:08:23,495 --> 00:08:25,418
I can't hear you, sleeping.

134
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:43,078
Why?

135
00:08:45,245 --> 00:08:46,245
Why?

136
00:08:49,343 --> 00:08:51,503
Look at what I've done.

137
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,799
It's all my fault.

138
00:08:59,615 --> 00:09:00,779
He knew me!

139
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:04,503
He looked up at me
and he asked, "Why?"

140
00:09:05,232 --> 00:09:06,587
Are you listening?

141
00:09:07,794 --> 00:09:11,133
It's 2:00 in the morning. Why are you
splashing water on your face?

142
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,100
My wife just woke me up

143
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:16,923
to tell me that she thinks
that she might've killed a man.

144
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:21,518
I guess I just wanted to be really sure
I was awake and really hearing right.

145
00:09:21,918 --> 00:09:23,068
What is that?

146
00:09:23,558 --> 00:09:24,563
I hate that!

147
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,315
The way you talk to me.

148
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,783
I just told you.

149
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:30,049
I think I killed someone.

150
00:09:30,405 --> 00:09:32,205
And you're acting annoyed!

151
00:09:32,564 --> 00:09:34,796
Like, "Why are you
making all this trouble?

152
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:37,326
Why are you making
my life so complicated?"

153
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:40,311
Hold on, I'm not annoyed,
but I am skeptical.

154
00:09:40,436 --> 00:09:43,332
And I guess I don't
understand why you're not.

155
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:46,217
What is there to be skeptical about?
The doctor said that I...

156
00:09:46,342 --> 00:09:48,795
I'd probably experienced
a traumatic event.

157
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,381
Well, I can't imagine
anything more traumatic

158
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:56,775
than mowing another human being
over with my car.

159
00:09:57,432 --> 00:10:00,594
All right, Allison, but you can't be
absolutely certain that you did it.

160
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:03,602
It's not like you saw
yourself mow him down.

161
00:10:03,988 --> 00:10:05,638
I don't need to see it!

162
00:10:06,334 --> 00:10:10,338
Obviously,
I'm being spared from seeing it.

163
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,058
- Maybe.
- "Maybe"?

164
00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:14,761
I don't know. Why would you be
chasing a man with your car?

165
00:10:14,886 --> 00:10:16,782
Doesn't that sound
out of character for you?

166
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,899
I need to call Devalos.

167
00:10:19,024 --> 00:10:21,912
I think there's a really
good chance that I did this.

168
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:24,658
I think there's a really
good chance that you did not.

169
00:10:24,783 --> 00:10:28,187
Allison, for God's sake, you went
through so much the other night.

170
00:10:28,312 --> 00:10:30,545
We all went through
so much the other night.

171
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:33,778
Can't we please,
just this once, take a breath?!

172
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:37,698
Okay, before you turn
your whole life upside down?

173
00:10:37,823 --> 00:10:41,042
Before you turn all of
our lives upside down?

174
00:10:41,823 --> 00:10:44,923
Okay, let's just wait and see
if the police find your car.

175
00:10:45,048 --> 00:10:47,927
See if there's some witnesses
who might be able to shed some light

176
00:10:48,052 --> 00:10:49,273
on what happened.

177
00:10:49,685 --> 00:10:52,952
Something other
than two disconnected dreams.

178
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:12,737
Thank you.

179
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,581
Hey, sorry it took so long.
Traffic.

180
00:11:21,706 --> 00:11:24,297
I asked the officer if he could,
you know, run the siren,

181
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:26,474
but he ignored me.

182
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,615
I filled Manny in on what
happened the other night.

183
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,397
Your missing six hours and all.

184
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:35,486
Your bank finally called. Turns out
there was some credit card activity

185
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,589
on your account
the night you were attacked.

186
00:11:37,714 --> 00:11:40,365
Wait a second. Somebody used
my credit cards? Do they know who?

187
00:11:41,046 --> 00:11:42,446
Actually, they do.

188
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:44,614
This is a security camera tape

189
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:47,072
from one of those big box home
improvement stores,

190
00:11:47,197 --> 00:11:48,290
Builder's Bonanza.

191
00:11:48,806 --> 00:11:50,006
Look familiar?

192
00:11:50,557 --> 00:11:51,607
Not really.

193
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:53,736
At 8:34, two days ago, you,

194
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:56,637
Allison Dubois,
went shopping at Builder's Bonanza.

195
00:11:56,762 --> 00:11:57,892
You kidding?

196
00:11:58,168 --> 00:11:59,418
What did I buy?

197
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:01,695
Apparently, you purchased a...

198
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,061
27-inch hand saw

199
00:12:04,186 --> 00:12:06,850
and a 12-pack of ziplock bags.

200
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:10,312
I have absolutely
no recollection of this.

201
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,814
That's the merchant's copy
of the receipt you signed.

202
00:12:15,223 --> 00:12:18,322
This is weird.
Doesn't even look like my handwriting.

203
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:20,989
Allison,
obviously that's you on the tape.

204
00:12:24,432 --> 00:12:28,246
Okay, I'm guessing that we're a lot
more excited about this than you are.

205
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,165
We don't have any footage of you
getting hit, but it's got to be a relief

206
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:34,169
to know that for at least part of
that time, you were just shopping.

207
00:12:34,973 --> 00:12:36,423
Well, I suppose so.

208
00:12:36,864 --> 00:12:38,756
And I know
we haven't found your car just yet,

209
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,451
but the fact that at least up until

210
00:12:41,576 --> 00:12:44,444
just before 9:00 you're still using
your credit card leads me to think

211
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:47,974
that when we do find your car, we might
even find your purse safely inside it.

212
00:12:48,211 --> 00:12:50,268
Who knows?
Maybe you weren't attacked at all.

213
00:12:50,517 --> 00:12:53,642
Maybe something fell on you,
knocked you out.

214
00:12:53,944 --> 00:12:56,009
Your car was parked safely
around the corner,

215
00:12:56,134 --> 00:12:58,290
and now it's sitting in a tow yard
somewhere because

216
00:12:58,415 --> 00:13:00,195
you ran out of time on the meter.

217
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:09,787
I got to pick up
your sisters in about 25 minutes.

218
00:13:10,058 --> 00:13:11,998
How about a driving
lesson in the meantime?

219
00:13:12,518 --> 00:13:13,518
Really?

220
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,198
Okay, now... whoa, whoa...
Before you take off the brake,

221
00:13:16,323 --> 00:13:18,755
before you put it in gear,
let's have a little chat.

222
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,867
Now, listen, sweetie, nobody likes to be
told what to do or how to do things,

223
00:13:21,992 --> 00:13:25,178
all right, but when it comes to driving,
I've been doing this for 20 years, okay?

224
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,970
I know, Dad.

225
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,847
So if I ask you to do something,
you got to do it, don't think about it,

226
00:13:29,972 --> 00:13:31,598
don't talk about it, just do it.

227
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:35,727
This is almost 3,000 pounds of machinery
that we're sitting in here.

228
00:13:35,852 --> 00:13:38,112
Like I said,
I've been doing this for 20 years.

229
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,810
So if I tell you to slow down,
slow down.

230
00:13:40,935 --> 00:13:44,285
If I tell you to turn the wheel
or hit the break, do it.

231
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:48,041
Afterwards, when we're parked,
we can talk about anything you'd like,

232
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,454
but while we're on the road,
I'm the boss, okay?

233
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,912
- You're the boss, Dad.
- Okay, all right, pumpkin.

234
00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:55,286
Okay, so mirrors are adjusted.
Seat belts are on.

235
00:13:55,411 --> 00:13:57,073
Mirrors adjusted, seat belts on.

236
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:00,490
Good, okay,
so now take off the emergency brake...

237
00:14:00,615 --> 00:14:02,243
Move the gearshift to "D."

238
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:04,230
Lift my foot off the brake.

239
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:08,359
Gently apply it to the accelerator, turn
the wheel and enter the flow of traffic.

240
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,236
- That's good, that's good.
- Sorry.

241
00:14:14,361 --> 00:14:16,111
You know just what to do.

242
00:14:19,337 --> 00:14:21,863
Let's play "Who's the Psychic?"

243
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:26,405
- Pardon me?
- Who's the psychic, you or me?

244
00:14:26,885 --> 00:14:29,599
I'm sorry, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

245
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:32,252
Wasn't I the one who said
that your car is just fine,

246
00:14:32,377 --> 00:14:34,456
probably sitting in an impound
lot somewhere?

247
00:14:34,983 --> 00:14:36,868
What are you trying to tell me?

248
00:14:36,993 --> 00:14:40,103
City Impound just called looking
for you... here's the address.

249
00:14:40,228 --> 00:14:43,553
- The "N" bus will take you right to it.
- Oh, my God, this is wonderful news.

250
00:14:43,678 --> 00:14:46,343
Didn't you say you thought
that your purse was still in the car?

251
00:14:46,643 --> 00:14:48,690
They're gonna want 160 bucks.

252
00:14:50,232 --> 00:14:51,405
Pay me back tomorrow.

253
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,780
I don't get it.

254
00:14:53,344 --> 00:14:56,228
What is there to get?
It was the most frustrating experience.

255
00:14:56,397 --> 00:15:00,357
I'm not talking about you teaching
Ariel to drive. I'm talking about this.

256
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:05,570
I mean, look at it.
There is not a mark on it.

257
00:15:06,443 --> 00:15:08,828
Look, there's not a ding or a dent.

258
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:13,524
There's not a dent or a ding because
it wasn't involved in a collision

259
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:16,039
with a human being
or with anything else for that matter.

260
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,136
- And that's good news, by the way.
- Yeah, it is...

261
00:15:19,261 --> 00:15:22,974
I guess why I never actually saw the
accident is the accident never happened.

262
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:25,021
That's the theory I'm embracing.

263
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,214
Just wish I knew where my purse was.

264
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:31,011
It was in that security video,
and I was hoping it would be in the car.

265
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,358
I'd barely have time to think
of something to say to her,

266
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:36,596
and she'd already be
saying it to me.

267
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:40,236
I'm sorry. I know how much you were
looking forward to teaching her.

268
00:15:40,361 --> 00:15:41,731
That doesn't sound like fun.

269
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,901
It wasn't.
It was no fun at all, not for me.

270
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,722
- Well, how did she do?
- She did fine.

271
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:51,199
She's a very good driver. She did
everything that I would want her to.

272
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,335
- That's what matters, isn't it?
- I suppose.

273
00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:01,314
You know what's funny?

274
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:04,365
Whenever I'm in a good mood about
something, something's getting to you.

275
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:08,341
You mean discovering you didn't kill
a man with your car lighten your mood?

276
00:16:29,401 --> 00:16:30,751
Hey, babe. Honey?

277
00:16:33,317 --> 00:16:34,617
What's going on?

278
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,746
What are you doing?
Why aren't you in bed?

279
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,874
I had a dream.
I saw where my purse turned up.

280
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,993
It's inside this garbage Dumpster.

281
00:16:42,275 --> 00:16:44,489
I want to go and get it
before someone else finds it

282
00:16:44,614 --> 00:16:46,703
or the garbage people come
and take the Dumpster away.

283
00:16:46,828 --> 00:16:48,772
That's if I'm not already too late.

284
00:16:49,295 --> 00:16:51,637
What? Wait a second.
Where is this Dumpster?

285
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:53,677
Did this Dumpster
come with an address?

286
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:56,723
It all happened outside this
trucking office downtown.

287
00:16:57,244 --> 00:16:59,216
I got the address
from the phone book.

288
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:03,304
- Allison, it's 4:00 in the morning.
- I know, that's why I got to get going.

289
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:06,629
I just... I didn't want you to
wake up and not know where I was.

290
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:08,871
I'll be back for breakfast.

291
00:17:55,025 --> 00:17:56,991
Usually when we try to figure out
who someone is,

292
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,764
we have to get him here fingerprint
and run the prints.

293
00:18:00,235 --> 00:18:02,748
This method you've come up with
not bringing the whole person

294
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,373
and just the part we need,
it's genius.

295
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:08,474
Name's Maria Vargas.
Lucky for us,

296
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,503
she was brought in on a DUI
a couple years ago,

297
00:18:10,628 --> 00:18:12,549
so her prints and her picture
are in the system.

298
00:18:12,986 --> 00:18:14,136
Maria Vargas.

299
00:18:15,555 --> 00:18:17,345
I have no idea who this woman is.

300
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:20,578
No reason you should.
She's a bookkeeper... or she was.

301
00:18:20,906 --> 00:18:23,601
Worked for a company called
Green Highway Trucking.

302
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:29,969
Green Highway Trucking.
I know... I know that name.

303
00:18:30,565 --> 00:18:32,843
I've been there.
I was there that night.

304
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,905
I can't be sure,
but I think it was...

305
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,563
after I bought that saw
and that box of baggies.

306
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:45,464
That's what I call timing.

307
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:49,195
We had an address on Maria, so I asked
a patrolman to swing by her place.

308
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:50,712
Was she there?

309
00:18:50,942 --> 00:18:53,635
Oh, yeah. Apparently,
she's been waiting for us.

310
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,228
I had her hand in my purse.

311
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:11,316
I... bought a saw.
I bought baggies.

312
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:15,019
- Yeah, but is your name Hector Alvarez?
- Who's Hector Alvarez?

313
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:16,884
I've no idea, but the victim here

314
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:19,148
was discovered conveniently
clutching this note.

315
00:19:20,249 --> 00:19:22,076
"Hector Alvarez did this to me."

316
00:19:22,737 --> 00:19:25,314
- What do you think?
- That's not my handwriting.

317
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,916
I don't even know a Hector Alvarez.

318
00:19:28,104 --> 00:19:29,554
My point precisely.

319
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:33,975
Am I supposed to believe that Maria
wrote that note before she died?

320
00:19:34,914 --> 00:19:37,139
I know.
Be a pretty neat trick, right?

321
00:19:37,516 --> 00:19:39,974
There's not a spot of
blood on this paper.

322
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:44,998
Can I make a suggestion?
Get out of here. Let us do our work.

323
00:19:45,228 --> 00:19:48,115
By tonight, we should know an awful
lot more. I'll give you a shout.

324
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,270
Fill you in.

325
00:19:56,991 --> 00:19:57,991
Hi, Dad.

326
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:01,479
Want to practice driving?

327
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,705
Oh, God, you know, honey,
I just got home.

328
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,665
Maybe Mommy...

329
00:20:09,003 --> 00:20:11,000
Mom's waiting for a phone call.

330
00:20:13,975 --> 00:20:16,604
Wait, isn't your learner's
permit no good after the sun sets?

331
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:18,941
'Cause... it's pretty much set.

332
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:21,888
I mean,
there's always the weekend, okay?

333
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:25,430
Kind of get the feeling you
don't like driving with me.

334
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:30,166
I was just telling Mom
what a good driver you are.

335
00:20:30,795 --> 00:20:32,445
How you just seem to...

336
00:20:33,351 --> 00:20:34,566
you just know.

337
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,456
Is that the same
as liking to drive with me?

338
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:44,413
Look, Ariel, I don't know where you get
this idea from. I love driving with you.

339
00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:48,075
I mean, we've only been out driving
that one time, but I loved it.

340
00:20:48,574 --> 00:20:52,546
And... you know, I just...
I don't think we should go out tonight,

341
00:20:52,671 --> 00:20:55,691
'cause I... you know,
I don't want you to get in any trouble,

342
00:20:55,816 --> 00:20:57,452
but if you want to get up,

343
00:20:57,577 --> 00:21:00,717
you know, early, say,
6:30 tomorrow morning...

344
00:21:01,441 --> 00:21:03,681
- You mean it?
- Sure, I mean it.

345
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,276
I wouldn't be offering
if I didn't mean it.

346
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,766
I love driving with you.

347
00:21:10,355 --> 00:21:13,688
Oh, daddy, I was just so worried
you hated driving with me.

348
00:21:14,555 --> 00:21:16,055
Don't be ridiculous.

349
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,112
Hello?

350
00:21:20,386 --> 00:21:23,156
- <i>You want the good or the bad news?</i>
- There's bad news?

351
00:21:23,618 --> 00:21:25,253
I'll start with the good.

352
00:21:25,378 --> 00:21:28,536
The medical examiner feels it's highly
unlikely you killed that young woman.

353
00:21:28,895 --> 00:21:30,097
Highly unlikely?

354
00:21:30,337 --> 00:21:33,082
<i>Remember that candlestick
she was beaten to death with?</i>

355
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,838
Judging from the angle of the blows,
the person who killed Maria Vargas

356
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,462
was about a foot taller than her.

357
00:21:37,739 --> 00:21:40,176
Taller? 'Cause I'm only five-two.

358
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,599
I know. Not tall.

359
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:46,095
Also, they feel very strongly the killer
was left-handed. You're a righty, right?

360
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:49,326
- All my life, I swear.
- <i>Also, they're telling me</i>

361
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,518
it would take huge strength to inflict
that kind of damage on another person.

362
00:21:52,816 --> 00:21:55,609
<i>No offense, but none of this
sounds like Allison Dubois to me.</i>

363
00:21:55,862 --> 00:21:57,212
No offense taken.

364
00:21:57,536 --> 00:22:00,386
<i>Oh, and the name on that note:
Hector Alvarez?</i>

365
00:22:00,922 --> 00:22:04,216
<i>It rang no bells with me or anyone
else over at police headquarters.</i>

366
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:06,282
<i>I checked with your boss.
Never heard, either.</i>

367
00:22:06,787 --> 00:22:09,098
The FBI is apparently
very familiar with this guy,

368
00:22:09,223 --> 00:22:11,440
and one of their best and brightest
is in there right now

369
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:12,872
bringing Manny up to speed.

370
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:16,185
He suggested I call you and make sure
you could be down here

371
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,670
first thing in the morning
so we can bring you up to speed.

372
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:21,050
I'll be there.
I'll definitely be there.

373
00:22:21,915 --> 00:22:23,488
So, what's the bad news?

374
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:25,510
<i>You know that note
with Alvarez's name on it...</i>

375
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,054
- <i>the one the dead girl was clutching?</i>
- Yeah.

376
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:29,888
Your fingerprints are all over it.

377
00:22:30,164 --> 00:22:31,516
How is that possible?

378
00:22:31,896 --> 00:22:34,894
I have no idea, but, hey,
look on the bright side.

379
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:37,360
<i>There's no law
against leaving notes.</i>

380
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:20,281
Who are you,
and what are you doing in my office?

381
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:24,271
Why are you just sitting there?

382
00:23:24,396 --> 00:23:26,487
You're not concerned
that I might call the police?

383
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:37,540
The only thing I'm not concerned
about is you calling the police.

384
00:23:37,911 --> 00:23:40,336
I don't know who you are
and what you want,

385
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,712
but if you don't tell me
what you're doing here...

386
00:23:44,337 --> 00:23:47,037
What are you going to do,
shoot me, Hector?

387
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:50,469
We both know that would be
a big waste of your time.

388
00:23:51,398 --> 00:23:54,432
What are you talking about?
Who are you?

389
00:23:55,543 --> 00:23:57,093
I'll give you a hint.

390
00:23:58,927 --> 00:24:01,272
You killed me earlier tonight.

391
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:37,189
Allison, it's barely 5:00 a.m.

392
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,026
I had it all wrong.

393
00:24:39,151 --> 00:24:42,146
I didn't lose those six hours the other
night. They were taken from me.

394
00:24:43,436 --> 00:24:45,733
Allison, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

395
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:49,416
Maria Vargas... that woman
who was killed by Hector Alvarez.

396
00:24:49,726 --> 00:24:52,837
The moment she died, something important
must have been happening in her life.

397
00:24:52,962 --> 00:24:54,643
Something she needed to finish.

398
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,798
I think she used me to do it.

399
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:58,246
She hijacked me.

400
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:01,165
I'm guessing that it happened

401
00:25:01,506 --> 00:25:05,253
that moment in the parking lot right
after I put the groceries in the car.

402
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,747
Yeah, I promise.
We'll talk about it tonight.

403
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:22,091
Excuse me, Miss?

404
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:28,116
Are you all right?

405
00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:30,735
Miss?

406
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,849
Oh, yes, I'm fine.

407
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:37,529
Thanks.

408
00:25:40,475 --> 00:25:41,998
Lost in thought.

409
00:25:42,404 --> 00:25:45,877
She had a whole agenda. It started
with me going in that hardware store.

410
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:49,088
Buying that saw,
that box of baggies.

411
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:54,185
And then sawing her own hand

412
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,306
so I could use her fingerprints
to gain access to her computer.

413
00:25:59,531 --> 00:26:02,685
That sounds like a pretty
grisly six hours.

414
00:26:04,426 --> 00:26:06,850
And I left out the part
where I stabbed a man in the chest

415
00:26:06,975 --> 00:26:08,274
with a pair of scissors.

416
00:26:08,877 --> 00:26:11,739
All of it to get this phone
number that I put in here.

417
00:26:13,215 --> 00:26:14,363
This number.

418
00:26:17,504 --> 00:26:19,994
You have any idea whose
number that might be?

419
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,664
There's only one way to find out.

420
00:26:24,096 --> 00:26:26,500
No. Joe, it's 5:08 in the morning.

421
00:26:28,174 --> 00:26:31,343
<i>We're sorry, the number
you have reached is not in service.</i>

422
00:26:31,752 --> 00:26:34,672
<i>Please check the number
or try your call again later.</i>

423
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,010
I don't get it.
Doesn't make any sense.

424
00:26:41,428 --> 00:26:44,800
Why would I go to all that trouble
if it's not even a working number?

425
00:26:44,925 --> 00:26:46,325
I don't get it.

426
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,326
You know, Allison...

427
00:26:49,152 --> 00:26:53,156
I got to get up and-and go
driving with Ariel in an hour.

428
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,870
What say we try to get
a little more sleep?

429
00:26:55,995 --> 00:26:58,908
Maybe it will make more sense
when the sun comes up.

430
00:27:00,613 --> 00:27:02,998
Now, put the key in the...
and turn it.

431
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:05,968
Now, turn on your... blinker.

432
00:27:06,832 --> 00:27:07,932
Now... Yeah.

433
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,160
Just pull away from the curb.

434
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,431
- Is something wrong, dad?
- You're kidding, right?

435
00:27:22,931 --> 00:27:25,692
You know the answer to that question.
Probably knew the answer to it

436
00:27:25,817 --> 00:27:28,358
before I even had a chance
to consider the question.

437
00:27:41,307 --> 00:27:42,857
Okay, you can go now.

438
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,417
Ariel, you came to a full stop. Now you
have to go through the intersection.

439
00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:50,368
- Ariel, I want you...
- I know what you want me to do.

440
00:27:53,081 --> 00:27:55,596
That's the problem, isn't it?
I know what you want me to do

441
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:57,661
before you say it.
I'm sorry, but I do.

442
00:27:57,786 --> 00:28:00,243
And why is that such a bad thing?
Why do you hate this?

443
00:28:00,368 --> 00:28:02,398
- I don't hate this.
- Hate being with me.

444
00:28:02,523 --> 00:28:05,266
You know, mom told me to try
and talk less, but still.

445
00:28:05,698 --> 00:28:08,921
- Okay, I'm sorry, sweetie.
- You know, it doesn't matter, okay?

446
00:28:09,046 --> 00:28:10,646
You still act all mad.

447
00:28:11,062 --> 00:28:13,581
Like this driving thing is for you,
and I'm letting you down.

448
00:28:13,706 --> 00:28:16,068
But it's not, it's for me,
and you're letting me down.

449
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,320
I know it is.

450
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:19,654
So too bad if it's not going
the way you pictured it

451
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:21,656
with your 20-year experience.

452
00:28:22,963 --> 00:28:26,967
When I'm sitting in class with
the driving teacher sitting next to me,

453
00:28:27,647 --> 00:28:29,248
I'm not trying to get in his head.

454
00:28:29,914 --> 00:28:33,364
I'm thinking, what would my dad do,
what would my dad say?

455
00:28:35,136 --> 00:28:36,486
God, am I stupid!

456
00:28:38,285 --> 00:28:40,032
You are not stupid.

457
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:42,929
Sweetie.

458
00:28:43,543 --> 00:28:46,015
Sweetie, you're not stupid.
I'm so sorry.

459
00:28:52,588 --> 00:28:55,338
Yeah. I know.
Move through the intersection.

460
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,446
- You guys all right?
- Oh God.

461
00:29:05,771 --> 00:29:07,540
That's my fault.
I totally didn't...

462
00:29:07,665 --> 00:29:10,511
You know what? I didn't look,
either, to be honest with you.

463
00:29:10,636 --> 00:29:12,236
Maybe it was my fault.

464
00:29:13,695 --> 00:29:14,716
You know what?

465
00:29:14,841 --> 00:29:17,604
- Let's not mention this to Mom.
- Let's not mention this to Mom.

466
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:27,089
<i>We're sorry,
but the number you have...</i>

467
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:37,274
I'm sorry.
Am I catching you at a bad time?

468
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,062
No, no.
I'm here for you.

469
00:29:39,187 --> 00:29:41,923
Detective Scanlon told me
I should come in early this morning.

470
00:29:42,048 --> 00:29:44,197
You would fill me in on
the Hector Alvarez case.

471
00:29:44,527 --> 00:29:47,410
Okay. I'm filling you in.
The case is all but closed.

472
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,902
- What?
- The FBI just called. They found him.

473
00:29:51,027 --> 00:29:53,224
They're holding him over at
Casa Valley Memorial Hospital.

474
00:29:53,349 --> 00:29:55,099
I was just about to run over there.

475
00:29:58,808 --> 00:30:00,431
You expecting a phone call?

476
00:30:00,556 --> 00:30:02,861
Oh, it's nothing.
It's just... just...

477
00:30:03,825 --> 00:30:04,825
I'm sorry.

478
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,138
FBI, Hector Alvarez?

479
00:30:07,621 --> 00:30:08,982
Hector Alvarez.

480
00:30:09,622 --> 00:30:11,976
Turns out to be
a very interesting fellow.

481
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:14,708
This Green Highway Trucking he owns?

482
00:30:15,432 --> 00:30:18,108
They're in the short-haul trucking
business or so he'd have people believe.

483
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,651
According to the FBI,

484
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:23,279
Mr. Alvarez's real business
is human trafficking.

485
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,667
Sneaking illegal immigrants
across the border for a hefty fee.

486
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,092
He was a coyote?

487
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:31,412
Maria Vargas worked for a coyote?

488
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:33,675
I'm sure she told herself
she was doing a good thing.

489
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,487
Helping people with no futures,
no jobs, get to a place

490
00:30:36,612 --> 00:30:39,220
where they can earn some money,
help their families.

491
00:30:39,345 --> 00:30:42,131
But this fellow Alvarez.

492
00:30:42,566 --> 00:30:46,176
Apparently, the Bureau has been trying
to build a case against him for years,

493
00:30:46,855 --> 00:30:49,109
but they've never been able
to prove anything.

494
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:51,975
Now,
with the murder of Maria Vargas,

495
00:30:52,968 --> 00:30:54,468
all that may change.

496
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,276
How long has he been here?
How did he get here?

497
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:04,736
Apparently, he drove himself.

498
00:31:05,368 --> 00:31:06,618
Two nights ago.

499
00:31:06,796 --> 00:31:08,532
- Stab wound.
- Through the heart.

500
00:31:11,508 --> 00:31:13,037
Is this something you dreamt about?

501
00:31:14,814 --> 00:31:16,916
I think this might
be something I did.

502
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:18,942
I mean...

503
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,479
it was Maria doing it, but still,

504
00:31:22,077 --> 00:31:25,340
I think it might have been my body,
my hand that

505
00:31:25,655 --> 00:31:27,426
put those scissors in him.

506
00:31:27,883 --> 00:31:30,429
Allison, I'm not sure I understand.

507
00:31:30,737 --> 00:31:32,864
I think from the second
that Maria died,

508
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:35,289
until I woke up under that overpass,

509
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:37,424
Maria appropriated my body

510
00:31:38,652 --> 00:31:41,400
so she could do something,
finish something.

511
00:31:41,962 --> 00:31:43,562
But I don't know what.

512
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,530
Is he going to be all right?

513
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:49,910
Well, they don't know for sure.

514
00:31:50,165 --> 00:31:52,171
He apparently bled so much
on the drive over

515
00:31:52,296 --> 00:31:54,963
that he passed out on the curb
in front of the emergency room.

516
00:31:55,345 --> 00:31:57,747
By the time they got him up here,
he was in this coma.

517
00:31:59,082 --> 00:32:00,432
What happens now?

518
00:32:01,577 --> 00:32:02,503
We wait.

519
00:32:02,936 --> 00:32:05,339
- Till what?
- Till he comes out of it.

520
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:08,584
At which time he'll be charged
with the death of Maria Vargas.

521
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:11,333
His clothing, in addition to being
soaked in his own blood,

522
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:13,171
was speckled with Maria's.

523
00:32:16,844 --> 00:32:18,852
No one was looking for yours.

524
00:32:22,646 --> 00:32:25,234
Who was that sitting there
next to him by the bed?

525
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,070
I was told that's his son,
Desiderio.

526
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:30,519
He has a son?

527
00:32:32,271 --> 00:32:35,368
Allison, I can see that you're torturing
yourself about this, but...

528
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,170
even if you did do
what you think you might have done,

529
00:32:38,295 --> 00:32:40,583
it would have clearly been
in self-defense.

530
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,769
Not to mention
you weren't in your right mind.

531
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,920
Maybe not in your own mind at all.

532
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,799
I agree with your boss.

533
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:50,445
It was self-defense.

534
00:32:51,037 --> 00:32:53,999
And it wasn't even you who did it.
I mean, not really.

535
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:56,483
What if he dies?

536
00:32:57,248 --> 00:32:59,809
What are you asking me?
Are you responsible?

537
00:33:00,227 --> 00:33:02,337
No. I don't think
you're responsible.

538
00:33:02,462 --> 00:33:04,200
You were defending yourself.

539
00:33:04,325 --> 00:33:06,125
I mean, not even yourself.

540
00:33:07,955 --> 00:33:09,905
And what if it goes to trial?

541
00:33:10,582 --> 00:33:14,051
How do I make sense of this to a jury?
I can't even make sense to myself.

542
00:33:14,176 --> 00:33:17,714
A woman that I have never met
has taken over my body

543
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:21,563
so she can get a number from a computer
for a phone that doesn't even work.

544
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:26,891
You're making yourself crazy over
something that may never happen.

545
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,060
Shut your eyes.
Try and get some rest.

546
00:33:37,624 --> 00:33:39,258
Diego, listen to me.

547
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:41,856
People are going to die.

548
00:33:42,722 --> 00:33:44,439
Yes, I'm frightened.

549
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,930
I think he knows
I heard him on the phone

550
00:33:48,055 --> 00:33:50,604
and I think he's worried
I might call the police.

551
00:33:53,938 --> 00:33:56,715
But how can I not call them?
I have to call them.

552
00:33:59,396 --> 00:34:01,957
Well, can't you come over here?
Be with me?

553
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:06,252
It's almost 5:30,
aren't you done with work yet?

554
00:34:08,111 --> 00:34:09,761
Yeah, I'll pick you up.

555
00:34:10,566 --> 00:34:11,766
Where are you?

556
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:14,259
1927...

557
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:16,567
Hennepin.

558
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:22,518
1927 Hennepin. Got it.
I'll be right there, darling.

559
00:34:30,293 --> 00:34:34,279
It's really not nice to eavesdrop
when people are on the phone, Maria.

560
00:34:36,423 --> 00:34:38,073
I guess we're even now.

561
00:34:39,957 --> 00:34:43,706
You'd actually call the police after all
the years we've been working together?

562
00:34:44,161 --> 00:34:45,624
How did you get in here?

563
00:34:49,269 --> 00:34:52,622
But don't worry, I'll put it back
under the mat when I leave.

564
00:34:57,633 --> 00:34:59,286
What would you have me do?

565
00:34:59,752 --> 00:35:02,724
I don't know, but you just
can't leave them there to die.

566
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:04,789
I have no choice.

567
00:35:05,095 --> 00:35:06,095
I got a tip.

568
00:35:06,697 --> 00:35:09,481
That's not just another truck
full of peasants from El Salvador.

569
00:35:10,248 --> 00:35:12,550
There's an undercover FBI agent
traveling with them,

570
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:14,109
pretending to be one of them.

571
00:35:14,234 --> 00:35:17,806
But what about the other 18
innocent people, women and children?

572
00:35:17,931 --> 00:35:21,292
You're gonna leave them in the middle
of the desert? Leave them to just die?

573
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:23,147
Of course they have to die.

574
00:35:23,272 --> 00:35:24,872
What choice do I have?

575
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:26,582
They have to die.

576
00:35:28,473 --> 00:35:29,773
You have to die.

577
00:35:57,821 --> 00:35:59,852
"1927 Hennepin."

578
00:36:02,852 --> 00:36:04,852
Don't worry about your friend.

579
00:36:05,143 --> 00:36:06,693
I'll give him a ride.

580
00:36:19,347 --> 00:36:21,260
It's ten after 7:00.
Here I am.

581
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,930
I hope it's important.

582
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:25,708
Four days ago,
some time before 5:30,

583
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:29,262
Maria Vargas overheard her boss,
Hector Alvarez, receive a tip.

584
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:33,982
An FBI agent, posing as
an unemployed El Salvadorian,

585
00:36:34,328 --> 00:36:37,069
was in one of Hector's trucks.

586
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,916
His sole purpose
for going to the U.S. was

587
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:42,658
to expose and arrest Hector
for human trafficking.

588
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:49,248
Hector knew Maria knew what
he was up to, so he killed her.

589
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:52,194
- Which is when you believe she...
- Possessed me.

590
00:36:52,475 --> 00:36:54,025
She... She needed me.

591
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,119
She knew.

592
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:58,451
Hector had already
contacted that driver.

593
00:36:58,695 --> 00:37:00,451
He had already instructed him

594
00:37:00,576 --> 00:37:03,720
to empty the truck,
to dump everyone there.

595
00:37:04,002 --> 00:37:07,140
Everyone, including that FBI agent,
to leave them to die in the desert.

596
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,048
Maria wanted to help those people.

597
00:37:11,173 --> 00:37:12,346
To get to them.

598
00:37:12,471 --> 00:37:13,621
To save them.

599
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:15,825
But she didn't know where they were.

600
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:19,819
She'd to be able to contact the driver,
to get the number off the computer.

601
00:37:20,186 --> 00:37:22,286
- Which you got.
- Which I got.

602
00:37:24,515 --> 00:37:26,201
And which is no good.

603
00:37:26,627 --> 00:37:28,008
- Let me see.
- <i>We're sorry,</i>

604
00:37:28,133 --> 00:37:29,777
<i>the number you have reached...</i>

605
00:37:29,902 --> 00:37:31,623
I dreamt about her last night.

606
00:37:31,748 --> 00:37:32,948
I saw her die.

607
00:37:33,592 --> 00:37:36,670
She has to be showing me
this still for a reason.

608
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:40,440
So we're thinking that these people are
still be out there somewhere, alive?

609
00:37:40,565 --> 00:37:42,676
Allison, it's been four days.

610
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:48,536
I'll call the FBI.
And I'll check out this number.

611
00:37:49,022 --> 00:37:50,022
Thank you.

612
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,073
We've been summoned.

613
00:38:08,224 --> 00:38:11,710
According to the Phoenix field office
of the FBI, Agent Marco Navarro

614
00:38:11,835 --> 00:38:15,139
was supposed to infiltrate a truckload
of illegals out of El Salvador.

615
00:38:15,264 --> 00:38:18,034
- No one's heard from him for four days.
- Oh, my God.

616
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:21,167
They now have helicopters
searching the area around Route 86,

617
00:38:21,292 --> 00:38:23,095
Route 85, and Interstate 19.

618
00:38:23,527 --> 00:38:25,135
Lot of empty space out there.

619
00:38:25,379 --> 00:38:27,304
Like looking for
a needle in a sand stack.

620
00:38:27,632 --> 00:38:29,805
And that number you gave me...

621
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,487
it was for a disposable cell phone,

622
00:38:31,612 --> 00:38:34,799
purchased for cash from a convenience
store here in Downtown Phoenix.

623
00:38:35,638 --> 00:38:37,022
Worthless as a clue.

624
00:38:39,597 --> 00:38:41,944
Everyone's doing the best we can,
Allison.

625
00:38:43,499 --> 00:38:44,738
So, what about Hector?

626
00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:46,778
He's still in his coma.

627
00:38:46,982 --> 00:38:49,660
I've had people check his office.
All the computers have been wiped clean.

628
00:38:50,744 --> 00:38:51,944
So, that's it?

629
00:38:52,268 --> 00:38:53,268
For now.

630
00:38:53,978 --> 00:38:57,058
Right now it's a matter
of time and luck.

631
00:38:57,274 --> 00:38:59,711
You should go home.
There's nothing more to do here.

632
00:39:00,195 --> 00:39:02,213
I'll call you if there's any news.

633
00:39:39,928 --> 00:39:40,928
Desiderio.

634
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,088
Stop crying.

635
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,990
I know what
your father told you to do.

636
00:39:47,141 --> 00:39:49,791
I need you to tell me
where you left them.

637
00:39:55,045 --> 00:39:56,045
Desiderio.

638
00:39:57,977 --> 00:39:58,977
Please.

639
00:40:14,116 --> 00:40:15,116
Desiderio.

640
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:18,510
<i>These are live pictures
of this breaking story.</i>

641
00:40:18,759 --> 00:40:22,151
<i>And if you're just tuning in,
what you're looking at are FBI,</i>

642
00:40:22,276 --> 00:40:24,823
<i>USCIS, and Mexican Federal agents...</i>

643
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:28,561
You look like someone who's been
up since 2:00 in the morning.

644
00:40:28,686 --> 00:40:30,509
<i>... apparently left to die
in the desert</i>

645
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,957
<i>along the Mexican-Arizona border.</i>

646
00:40:33,175 --> 00:40:34,925
You saved a lot of lives.

647
00:40:35,608 --> 00:40:37,899
You and... Desiderio.

648
00:40:40,529 --> 00:40:42,883
After you called,
I phoned over to the hospital.

649
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,859
They said he was there,
still watching over his comatose father.

650
00:40:46,417 --> 00:40:49,153
I went over.
There wasn't a lot of conversation.

651
00:40:50,149 --> 00:40:53,849
He clearly wanted to tell somebody.
He was clearly tortured about it.

652
00:40:55,841 --> 00:40:58,120
Turns out he left them out there
with two cases of water,

653
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,204
and a bag full of candy bars.

654
00:41:00,527 --> 00:41:02,583
They're all still alive, thank God.

655
00:41:07,807 --> 00:41:09,207
What about Hector?

656
00:41:10,996 --> 00:41:12,844
Do I need to hire an attorney?

657
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,256
No, I think you're all clear.

658
00:41:19,127 --> 00:41:20,727
Sometime after I left,

659
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:25,793
Desiderio held a pillow over his
father's face and smother him to death.

660
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:30,403
The agent guardian in the room was
outside the door and heard nothing.

661
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,301
Did you have breakfast yet?

662
00:41:51,948 --> 00:41:54,409
So, what's new
and exciting in your life?

663
00:41:55,234 --> 00:41:58,333
Ariel, my oldest daughter
is learning to drive.

664
00:41:59,144 --> 00:42:00,544
Learning to drive?
