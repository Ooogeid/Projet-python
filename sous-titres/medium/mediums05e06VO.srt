1
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:03,620
Hello?
Is there anyone out there?

2
00:00:03,827 --> 00:00:05,423
Hello? Hello?

3
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:07,207
Can anyone hear me?

4
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:09,142
Hello?

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,130
My name is Joe Dubois.

6
00:00:12,135 --> 00:00:14,108
Is anyone receiving this message?

7
00:00:16,115 --> 00:00:18,096
I'm looking for Allison Dubois.

8
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:21,747
If anybody's seen her,
this is her husband.

9
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:23,484
Allison Dubois.

10
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,262
Her name is Allison Dubois.

11
00:00:34,349 --> 00:00:35,524
Still nothing?

12
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:39,246
Oh, no, but that can mean
a lot of things, sweetie.

13
00:00:40,645 --> 00:00:43,992
We know your mom is out there.
We just got to sit tight.

14
00:00:45,237 --> 00:00:46,237
Dad...

15
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:49,731
The food, it's all gone.

16
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,230
Wait, how's that possible?

17
00:00:52,854 --> 00:00:55,380
I thought we still had
some energy bars left.

18
00:00:55,896 --> 00:00:58,447
Bridgette and Marie
just split the last one.

19
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:03,912
All right.

20
00:01:04,776 --> 00:01:05,976
Listen, Ariel,

21
00:01:06,744 --> 00:01:08,995
I'm going to need you
to watch your sisters.

22
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:10,944
Wait, where are you going?

23
00:01:11,358 --> 00:01:13,142
I got to go outside, sweetie.

24
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:15,086
I got to go find us some food.

25
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:17,490
Wait, Dad!

26
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:20,190
- Please don't go!
- Sweetie, I'm not going far.

27
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:22,375
I'm just going to check
the houses on our block.

28
00:01:22,613 --> 00:01:24,622
They got to have some food
in there, all right.

29
00:01:24,747 --> 00:01:25,838
Please, Dad?!

30
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:27,210
Now you stay here,

31
00:01:27,823 --> 00:01:29,276
and watch the girls,

32
00:01:30,016 --> 00:01:32,306
make sure the house stays locked.

33
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,678
No matter what,

34
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,708
don't let anyone inside.

35
00:01:41,637 --> 00:01:42,637
Come here.

36
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,488
I love you.

37
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,017
I love you, Dad.

38
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:25,269
Joe, wake up.

39
00:02:25,538 --> 00:02:27,599
Earthquake! Come on, get the girls.

40
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:30,732
- Mom?!
- Ariel, get in the doorway!

41
00:02:31,747 --> 00:02:32,747
Get down!

42
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,713
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

43
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,764
www.sub-way.fr
www.seriessub.com

44
00:03:31,982 --> 00:03:34,422
Hey, do we know
that our gas line is okay?

45
00:03:34,827 --> 00:03:37,165
Mom and I checked everything.
We're fine.

46
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,387
You ladies eat
or we're going to be late.

47
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:42,617
- Maybe school is cancelled.
- School is not cancelled. Eat.

48
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:46,990
Cell phones are back up.
Devalos just sent me a text.

49
00:03:47,115 --> 00:03:48,600
He wants to meet him in Chandler.

50
00:03:48,725 --> 00:03:50,901
Chandler?
Well, you better get going.

51
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,106
I got everything covered here.

52
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:55,317
Do you know
where the batteries are for this?

53
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:57,650
- I think they're in the closet.
- The closet?

54
00:03:57,775 --> 00:03:59,723
Great. What if there really was
an emergency?

55
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:02,317
What if it was in the middle of
the night with no electricity?

56
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,242
What if there really was a gas leak?

57
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:05,762
Yeah, I hear you.

58
00:04:06,174 --> 00:04:08,066
I'll tell you what,
I'll battery-up everything.

59
00:04:08,191 --> 00:04:10,792
Actually, I'll get new flashlights.
One for every room.

60
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,067
Flashlights?
We get flashlights?

61
00:04:13,422 --> 00:04:15,343
We should get some of those packs,

62
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:17,342
emergency supplies with all the...

63
00:04:17,865 --> 00:04:20,133
the energy bars
and the first aid kits.

64
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:22,260
All right,
I'll pick up one of those, too.

65
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:24,957
One? We need like ten.
And we need water.

66
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:27,183
Those big gallons
so we can store it up.

67
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:30,770
You know what? I'll pick everything up
on my way back from Chandler.

68
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:33,692
Okay, give me a kiss.

69
00:04:34,913 --> 00:04:36,963
Bye, guys.
Love you. Love you.

70
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:04,963
Appreciate you coming
all the way down here,

71
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:07,563
especially after the morning
we've had. Your family is okay?

72
00:05:07,688 --> 00:05:09,318
They're shook up but they're okay.

73
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:12,296
The one good thing about that earthquake
kept most of the press occupied.

74
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:14,948
I think this thing's going
to turn into a circus.

75
00:05:16,905 --> 00:05:18,149
Welcome to Amityville.

76
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:20,924
Matthew and Carolyn Donlin.

77
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:22,736
Their kids, Jeff and Sarah.

78
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,321
Signs of forced entry through
the construction in the back.

79
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:36,218
Intruder enters this room from
over there, stands here, shoots.

80
00:05:37,092 --> 00:05:40,213
Police found the television on,
glass of wine on the coffee table.

81
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:42,616
The father's watch and wallet
are sitting on the table.

82
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:44,801
Jewelry box upstairs,
out in the open, untouched.

83
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:48,221
Art's all here. Cars are all here.
No signs of theft.

84
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:50,314
No signs of anything.

85
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:53,191
According to our preliminary
background check on the family,

86
00:05:53,316 --> 00:05:55,238
it's hard to imagine
a motive for this.

87
00:05:55,363 --> 00:05:57,426
These are hardworking,
churchgoing people.

88
00:05:57,551 --> 00:06:00,148
Is that why I'm here to help you
figure out a motive?

89
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:02,023
That and one other thing.

90
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,494
There are two more rooms
just like this one,

91
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:06,870
filled with blood,

92
00:06:06,995 --> 00:06:08,645
just one thing missing.

93
00:06:10,843 --> 00:06:11,843
No bodies.

94
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:14,938
Well, I can't say
I'm entirely surprised.

95
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:18,360
This exercise was supposed
to be an opportunity

96
00:06:18,485 --> 00:06:20,851
to boost your average
before the midterm.

97
00:06:21,537 --> 00:06:24,514
And while some of you
did extremely well...

98
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,850
nice work, Ms. Dubois...

99
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:29,263
there are still

100
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:30,533
those of you

101
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:32,599
who don't even bother

102
00:06:32,913 --> 00:06:33,913
to try.

103
00:06:34,897 --> 00:06:36,118
So, let's review.

104
00:06:36,243 --> 00:06:38,043
Open your books to page 45.

105
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,799
Volume of prism.

106
00:06:40,694 --> 00:06:44,053
Who can tell me if the area of
the base of a prism is A or B?

107
00:06:53,248 --> 00:06:55,198
Well, I have to get to class.

108
00:06:58,934 --> 00:06:59,984
Okay, then.

109
00:07:01,282 --> 00:07:03,038
I'll talk to you later, Ash!

110
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:10,993
You know who I am, right?

111
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,772
So, here's the thing.

112
00:07:14,897 --> 00:07:16,762
I know you don't know me but...

113
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,342
I know you're really good
at geometry,

114
00:07:19,643 --> 00:07:21,898
and you probably know
that I'm really bad at it.

115
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,444
And I was wondering,

116
00:07:25,614 --> 00:07:29,073
there's the big test coming up and all,
if maybe you could help me?

117
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:32,492
You finding what you're looking for?

118
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:35,666
Actually, no, I'm looking for
those emergency backpacks

119
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,622
that everybody has at the register.

120
00:07:37,793 --> 00:07:40,335
Well, the individual packs
have all been snatched up.

121
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,771
But if you're interested,

122
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:44,736
we do have some of the larger
family size kits left.

123
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:46,697
They're right over here.

124
00:07:46,822 --> 00:07:47,822
Excellent.

125
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:52,054
Each one comes with enough rations
to accommodate

126
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:54,055
an average family for a solid month.

127
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:57,096
Well, I have a family of five.
Do you think one kit's enough?

128
00:07:57,221 --> 00:07:58,771
Think of it this way.

129
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,955
They're not really supplies.

130
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,321
In a way,
they're kind of like insurance.

131
00:08:03,446 --> 00:08:04,576
How do you mean?

132
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:06,701
Murphy's Law, right?
The more prepared you are,

133
00:08:06,826 --> 00:08:09,280
the less likely you are
to ever have to use this stuff.

134
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:11,804
Excuse me.

135
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,233
Sure.

136
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:21,866
You're kidding me.

137
00:08:28,818 --> 00:08:29,948
The girls asleep?

138
00:08:30,073 --> 00:08:31,723
Ariel's still studying.

139
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:34,086
You okay?

140
00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:36,040
It's nothing.

141
00:08:36,952 --> 00:08:39,011
The important thing is
when the apocalypse hits,

142
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:42,211
I may not be able to walk,
but I'll have plenty to eat and drink.

143
00:08:43,311 --> 00:08:44,731
Are you making fun of me?

144
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:46,251
Not me. Not ever.

145
00:08:48,706 --> 00:08:50,987
Should I even ask
how much all of that cost us?

146
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:52,726
Well, no, you should not.

147
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:55,040
You should just think
of it as an investment.

148
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:56,658
I don't know about that.

149
00:08:56,783 --> 00:08:59,718
When I make an investment, I like to
look forward to the day it pays off.

150
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:02,826
Personally, I hope I never
see any of that stuff again.

151
00:09:32,152 --> 00:09:33,852
I'm so glad you're back.

152
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:36,840
I was getting so worried.
It's been almost a week.

153
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:56,568
Geiger reading normal.

154
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:05,303
Oh, my God!

155
00:10:05,656 --> 00:10:06,689
Peaches?!

156
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:09,283
Thank you.

157
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,941
Thank you so much.

158
00:10:11,363 --> 00:10:12,752
I found a hospital.

159
00:10:12,877 --> 00:10:14,277
Plenty to salvage.

160
00:10:14,402 --> 00:10:16,202
I'll go back out tomorrow.

161
00:10:20,565 --> 00:10:22,365
Did you see anything else?

162
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:25,541
Was there anybody else out there?

163
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:27,481
No, I'm sorry.

164
00:10:28,158 --> 00:10:31,255
I got all the way to Tucson this time.
It's the same there as everywhere else.

165
00:10:32,205 --> 00:10:33,605
Just like Phoenix,

166
00:10:34,154 --> 00:10:35,454
just like Tempe.

167
00:10:38,462 --> 00:10:39,762
Everyone's dead.

168
00:10:51,906 --> 00:10:53,306
It felt so real...

169
00:10:54,374 --> 00:10:56,308
the hopelessness, the...

170
00:10:57,576 --> 00:10:59,026
futility. And it...

171
00:11:00,946 --> 00:11:01,946
it felt...

172
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:05,911
soon, like it's a tomorrow
that isn't all that far away.

173
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,509
So, what are we talking,
natural disaster?

174
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:11,899
I don't think so.

175
00:11:13,734 --> 00:11:15,924
They were worried about radiation.

176
00:11:16,854 --> 00:11:18,468
Maybe a suitcase bomb.

177
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:21,501
I don't know. I saw two survivors,

178
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:24,221
in a bunker somewhere,
trying to stay alive.

179
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:27,494
You know, the weird thing.

180
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:29,663
I met one of them yesterday.

181
00:11:30,411 --> 00:11:33,146
He was the owner of the store
where I bought all those...

182
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:34,880
survival supplies.

183
00:11:35,436 --> 00:11:37,286
You're not going to like this but...

184
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:39,956
and maybe it's because
I'm just unwilling to think about

185
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:42,983
everything coming to such
a horrible and abrupt end...

186
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,162
but do you think this might have
a link with the earthquake?

187
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:48,193
I mean, I know it really got to you.

188
00:11:48,318 --> 00:11:50,925
Is this maybe a way of
dealing with your anxiety?

189
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,600
No, I don't think so.

190
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:55,209
It felt different.

191
00:11:55,856 --> 00:11:57,506
Okay, let's say that...

192
00:11:58,521 --> 00:12:00,784
something terrible
is going to happen.

193
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:05,318
What do we do?
Did you see anything that might...

194
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:10,573
help us figure out what kind
of precautions we should take?

195
00:12:12,835 --> 00:12:14,585
That's why I'm so scared.

196
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,013
But you saw this guy
who survived it, right?

197
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,862
So, I mean,
he would know what to do.

198
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:22,947
Maybe you should talk to him.

199
00:12:26,524 --> 00:12:27,524
Excuse me?

200
00:12:28,732 --> 00:12:30,612
I'm sorry to bother you, Mr...?

201
00:12:31,112 --> 00:12:33,618
- Who's asking?
- Oh, I'm Allison. I'm Allison Dubois.

202
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:37,524
I was here yesterday, I bought a ton
of those family survival packs.

203
00:12:38,835 --> 00:12:40,798
Russell. Russell Burgess.

204
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:42,789
Something the matter?

205
00:12:42,914 --> 00:12:45,031
Those survival packs
giving you a problem?

206
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:47,052
Nothing to do with what I bought.

207
00:12:47,177 --> 00:12:49,184
Everything's fine.
That's not why I'm here.

208
00:12:50,072 --> 00:12:51,122
Okay, then.

209
00:12:51,424 --> 00:12:54,147
You strike me as a man
who knows a lot about survival.

210
00:12:54,745 --> 00:12:56,233
So, I was wondering if...

211
00:12:56,403 --> 00:12:58,677
if you wouldn't mind if maybe
I could just pick your brain

212
00:12:58,802 --> 00:13:00,224
for a couple minutes.

213
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:02,509
You see,
I grew up during the Cold War.

214
00:13:02,634 --> 00:13:05,867
And when the Soviet Union collapsed,
we all thought it was a reprieve.

215
00:13:05,992 --> 00:13:07,427
But then you had 9/11.

216
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:09,096
Now we have terror attacks,

217
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,666
suitcase nukes,
anthrax in an envelope.

218
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:14,024
And that's just
the evil that men do.

219
00:13:14,423 --> 00:13:16,312
You factor in global warming,

220
00:13:16,651 --> 00:13:18,547
hurricanes, floods, drought,

221
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:19,897
fires,

222
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,913
any one of those is enough
to snap the infrastructure.

223
00:13:23,307 --> 00:13:25,680
We're going to wake up one morning
living back in the Stone Age.

224
00:13:26,465 --> 00:13:28,975
- Do you really think so?
- Hey, I'm not the only one.

225
00:13:29,323 --> 00:13:31,019
A lot of really smart people...

226
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,852
economists, historians...

227
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:34,939
they see the writing on the wall.

228
00:13:35,251 --> 00:13:38,610
Population is growing just as fast
as our resources are drying up.

229
00:13:38,988 --> 00:13:41,865
One way or another, we're on
the verge of some very bad times.

230
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,927
But we'll be okay,
we've got our family survival packs.

231
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:49,119
See, and that's the thing.

232
00:13:49,244 --> 00:13:50,991
Supplies are only one part of it.

233
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:53,196
Even if you're well stocked,

234
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:55,220
what do you do when those
who don't have enough

235
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:57,048
find out that you have plenty?

236
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,258
That's why the really well prepared
home, Mrs. Dubois,

237
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:03,096
includes a gun.

238
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:08,167
You wanted to see me?

239
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:09,307
I did indeed.

240
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:12,559
We may have caught
a break on the Donlin case.

241
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,518
All that construction
on their house?

242
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:18,873
I spoke with the contractor,
got a list of the names on his crew.

243
00:14:18,998 --> 00:14:20,540
One of them didn't check out.

244
00:14:20,665 --> 00:14:22,902
Turns out,
the guy's real name is Lloyd Higgins.

245
00:14:23,027 --> 00:14:24,506
He was working under an alias,

246
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:27,267
probably because he has
a history of violent offenses,

247
00:14:27,392 --> 00:14:29,342
including aggravated assault.

248
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:33,371
No alibi for the night of the murders.
I was just about to go in and grill him.

249
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:35,918
- Thought you might want to watch.
- Sure.

250
00:15:03,505 --> 00:15:07,119
I think I know where they are,
what he did with the Donlins' bodies.

251
00:15:07,588 --> 00:15:10,695
I really appreciate you taking
the time to walk me through all this.

252
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:14,176
- It's no big deal.
- No!

253
00:15:14,674 --> 00:15:15,674
It is,

254
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:17,879
and I appreciate it.

255
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,214
So, would you mind
doing a couple more?

256
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,612
I have a practice sheet.

257
00:15:27,204 --> 00:15:29,053
It's a test from a couple years ago.

258
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,888
I asked Mr. Walsh for some
extra help and he gave me this.

259
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,329
This is pretty straightforward.

260
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:38,312
"The Mudville Rockets
are building a new stadium.

261
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:41,565
"Three times the width
of the field is twice the length,

262
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,776
"and four times the length
is 20 more than the perimeter."

263
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,058
So, to find the dimensions,
you would...

264
00:15:52,062 --> 00:15:53,062
What?

265
00:15:54,456 --> 00:15:55,756
Nothing, just...

266
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:59,250
I understand this stuff so much
better when it comes from you.

267
00:16:02,136 --> 00:16:04,965
I don't know if you have
a lot going on or whatever,

268
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,040
but if you're not crazy busy,

269
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,485
do want to do something Friday?

270
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:15,674
Honey?

271
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:18,293
I need to talk to you
about something.

272
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:20,784
Is this going to be
a money conversation?

273
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:23,359
I hate going to sleep
after a money conversation.

274
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:25,974
I took your advice and I went back
to the camping store,

275
00:16:26,099 --> 00:16:28,738
and I spoke to the man about
being prepared for emergencies.

276
00:16:29,145 --> 00:16:31,406
Oh, no. You didn't buy any
more survival kits, did you?

277
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:36,359
He pretty much got me convinced...

278
00:16:37,026 --> 00:16:38,455
we need to buy a gun.

279
00:16:41,193 --> 00:16:42,293
Well, say something.

280
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:46,543
You hate guns.

281
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:52,303
All the violence that you see,
you want to bring a gun into our house?

282
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:55,086
Well, I don't want to,
but I'm starting to think we have to!

283
00:16:55,211 --> 00:16:56,868
You're going to think
this is extreme,

284
00:16:56,993 --> 00:17:00,268
but I'm starting to worry about the
whole breakdown of the social order.

285
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,981
Excuse me? I have no idea
what you're talking about.

286
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,292
Yes, you do.

287
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:06,926
What if there was no police?

288
00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:09,861
What if there was
no public safety of any kind?

289
00:17:10,627 --> 00:17:12,124
Why? Where did they go?

290
00:17:12,249 --> 00:17:13,996
I don't know!
If there was some kind of...

291
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:16,957
apocalyptic situation,
like a natural disaster

292
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:18,692
or a terrorist incident.

293
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:21,346
How would we protect ourselves

294
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:23,935
from the people
who haven't prepared the way we have?

295
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,754
Who want what's ours?

296
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,489
Our energy bars?
Our chemical toilets?

297
00:17:28,883 --> 00:17:30,609
No, I'm not buying a gun.

298
00:17:30,975 --> 00:17:32,882
What about our daughters?
We have daughters.

299
00:17:33,007 --> 00:17:35,659
Joe, what if somebody
wanted our daughters?

300
00:17:36,161 --> 00:17:37,497
Okay. Mark this moment.

301
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:40,222
It's historic... you have
officially left the planet.

302
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:43,774
- Where is this coming from?
- It's not coming from anywhere.

303
00:17:44,471 --> 00:17:45,521
I told you.

304
00:17:45,757 --> 00:17:48,268
I went to speak with that man,
the man from my dreams.

305
00:17:48,393 --> 00:17:49,993
Hey, it was your idea.

306
00:17:50,874 --> 00:17:54,769
I'm just... I'm trying to be prepared
in case of a catastrophe.

307
00:17:54,894 --> 00:17:56,635
You want to know
what a catastrophe is?

308
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,077
A catastrophe is
when a child finds a loaded gun

309
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:00,870
and it goes off,
that's a catastrophe.

310
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,488
We're not going to leave it loaded.
We wouldn't leave it loaded.

311
00:18:03,613 --> 00:18:06,109
We would teach our girls,
we would warn them.

312
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:08,265
No, about the danger of a weapon...

313
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:12,048
Allison, that doesn't work that way.
No, one time, one mistake and that's it.

314
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,119
I'm sorry, but there's no argument
that's going to convince me

315
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:16,866
to bring a gun into our house.

316
00:18:16,991 --> 00:18:19,624
- Just think about it.
- I'm not thinking about it?

317
00:18:19,749 --> 00:18:22,269
Allison, do you know what
the numbers are, the statistics?

318
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:25,562
Do you know any more dozen times
likely you are to shoot yourself

319
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:27,757
or somebody you love
than a home invader?

320
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:29,947
Yeah, I don't care
about statistics, Joe.

321
00:18:30,072 --> 00:18:32,382
- All right, well...
- You don't know what I'm seeing.

322
00:18:32,507 --> 00:18:34,606
You don't know how
bad it's going to get.

323
00:18:34,935 --> 00:18:37,912
No, I don't.
And nobody does, and neither do you.

324
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:40,473
I'm sorry,
I'm not going to live my whole life

325
00:18:40,598 --> 00:18:42,596
in fear of the worst case scenario.

326
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,451
I won't do it, Al, I can't.

327
00:19:20,254 --> 00:19:22,141
I can't do it.

328
00:19:22,804 --> 00:19:24,907
I don't want to live
like this anymore.

329
00:19:26,388 --> 00:19:27,536
Come here.

330
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:29,109
I know it's hard,

331
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:30,877
but you have to be strong.

332
00:19:31,384 --> 00:19:32,670
What's the point?

333
00:19:33,337 --> 00:19:34,604
This isn't life.

334
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,821
We're stuck in this hole.

335
00:19:39,148 --> 00:19:42,284
I haven't been outside in so long.

336
00:19:42,821 --> 00:19:45,293
You can't go out there.
It's too dangerous.

337
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:46,618
You know that.

338
00:19:47,828 --> 00:19:48,878
Look at me.

339
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,850
We're still alive.

340
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:54,891
We have each other.

341
00:19:55,357 --> 00:19:57,071
I know you didn't choose this.

342
00:19:57,718 --> 00:19:58,918
Neither did I,

343
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:00,967
but here we are.

344
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:04,119
We're a team now, you and me.

345
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,039
But there's no one else.

346
00:20:09,428 --> 00:20:11,078
What are we even doing?

347
00:20:12,198 --> 00:20:15,590
What's the point if
we're the only ones left?

348
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:25,266
We have to endure.

349
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,187
The world needs people in it.

350
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:30,849
Right now, there's you,

351
00:20:30,974 --> 00:20:32,223
and there's me.

352
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:34,188
That's for starters.

353
00:20:34,512 --> 00:20:36,587
And together, we'll just make more.

354
00:20:39,335 --> 00:20:40,485
I'll be Adam.

355
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,160
And you'll be my Eve.

356
00:20:57,804 --> 00:20:59,438
You might want to join me.

357
00:20:59,563 --> 00:21:00,563
Of course.

358
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,823
Lee just called.

359
00:21:02,948 --> 00:21:05,374
He mentioned some smokestacks
you told him about.

360
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:07,336
He sent a team out there,
and, apparently,

361
00:21:07,461 --> 00:21:09,282
they've uncovered
some human remains.

362
00:21:09,407 --> 00:21:11,321
Now, the media's already
heard about it,

363
00:21:11,446 --> 00:21:15,060
and the mayor is pressuring me
to make a statement on the Donlin case.

364
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:18,259
The trouble is,
the body we found out there

365
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,931
doesn't belong
to any of the Donlins.

366
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:23,948
Found her in a shallow
grave wrapped in a tarp.

367
00:21:24,073 --> 00:21:25,223
Nothing else.

368
00:21:25,476 --> 00:21:27,250
Throat split from ear to ear.

369
00:21:28,323 --> 00:21:29,764
We know she's not a Donlin.

370
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,958
Other than that, we haven't a clue.

371
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,885
<i>I don't know what to think.
I've been dreaming about her certain</i>

372
00:21:44,055 --> 00:21:46,996
that the things that I see take place
in the future, but now,

373
00:21:47,121 --> 00:21:48,401
it makes no sense.

374
00:21:48,526 --> 00:21:51,101
It turns out that she's been dead
for almost a week.

375
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:53,179
Okay, and that's awful.

376
00:21:53,435 --> 00:21:55,314
But there is an upside to this.

377
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,948
- You can't be serious.
- <i>Now, hold on a second, look.</i>

378
00:21:58,073 --> 00:21:59,776
<i>If she's dead now, there's no way</i>

379
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,775
<i>that she's going to be around
to survive some catastrophic event.</i>

380
00:22:02,949 --> 00:22:06,826
Which means that there may not be
a catastrophic event in the future.

381
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:08,539
Right, right.

382
00:22:08,802 --> 00:22:11,783
And maybe you're right.
Maybe none of this is going to happen.

383
00:22:12,783 --> 00:22:14,614
Can you hold on a second, Joe?

384
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:17,004
Sorry, but we need to take a drive.

385
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:18,963
Lee just found the Donlins.

386
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,750
Remember to show all your work
in the space provided.

387
00:22:24,211 --> 00:22:28,215
This is worth ten percent of your final
grade, so please check all your answers.

388
00:22:37,418 --> 00:22:40,468
<i>"The Mudville Rockets are
building a new stadium."</i>

389
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,563
I don't understand. Why are you
so mad if you think you aced the test?

390
00:22:56,688 --> 00:22:58,608
Because I didn't really ace it.
I cheated,

391
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:01,433
and I didn't even know I was cheating.
Gavin tricked me.

392
00:23:01,951 --> 00:23:04,836
I don't know. On a list of awful things,
this ranks pretty low to me.

393
00:23:04,961 --> 00:23:06,669
I mean, you nailed
your geometry midterm,

394
00:23:06,794 --> 00:23:09,451
and now you're, like,
new best friends with Gavin Coley.

395
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:13,139
Place has been closed
for a couple years.

396
00:23:13,264 --> 00:23:14,989
Used to be a fairly nice restaurant.

397
00:23:15,114 --> 00:23:18,126
A local noticed that foul smell
coming out of the place,

398
00:23:18,614 --> 00:23:19,756
called it in.

399
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:21,120
I don't understand.

400
00:23:21,245 --> 00:23:23,950
I thought you said you found some
bodies. Where's the forensic team?

401
00:23:24,075 --> 00:23:25,958
Remains, I said, remains.

402
00:23:26,251 --> 00:23:29,613
I sent them away once I realized
what I might be dealing with.

403
00:23:32,186 --> 00:23:34,055
I wanted you to see this first.

404
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,332
Is that what I think it is?

405
00:23:36,627 --> 00:23:38,204
Those are human remains.

406
00:23:38,505 --> 00:23:40,293
Partial human remains, anyway.

407
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:42,794
What happened here, Lee?

408
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:45,108
Best guess?
Someone brought bodies here,

409
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:46,617
put 'em in the sink.

410
00:23:47,148 --> 00:23:49,122
Pour in the right concentration
of sulfuric acid,

411
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:51,035
you can boil down
just about anything.

412
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,264
Oh, my God.

413
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,548
How many people are
we talking about?

414
00:23:54,673 --> 00:23:58,198
By the time I got here, forensics had
recovered this half-dissolved bone.

415
00:23:58,323 --> 00:24:00,309
Appears to have belonged
to a young adult.

416
00:24:00,434 --> 00:24:03,401
Also found what looks to be a gallstone.
I'm guessing that's from the father.

417
00:24:04,081 --> 00:24:07,005
Some tooth fillings that look pretty
old, the young girl's hairpin.

418
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,650
Are you saying that this...

419
00:24:08,913 --> 00:24:10,408
sludge is the Donlins?

420
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,531
I won't have proof positive
for a couple hours, but...

421
00:24:13,656 --> 00:24:16,540
Who knows about this?
Does anybody else know about this?

422
00:24:19,736 --> 00:24:21,167
Wait, wait please.

423
00:24:26,142 --> 00:24:27,382
He's white.

424
00:24:29,892 --> 00:24:32,942
- What did you say?
- It's them, it's the Donlins.

425
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:37,477
But the man who shot them, he's not the
man you brought in. The subcontractor.

426
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:39,979
The man who killed
the Donlins is white.

427
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:43,691
And I've come all this way...

428
00:24:44,022 --> 00:24:47,237
... just to drink your blood.

429
00:24:47,406 --> 00:24:48,842
What's going on in here?

430
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:50,030
Nothing.

431
00:24:50,594 --> 00:24:53,664
Bridgette, are you playing with
one of our emergency flashlights?

432
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:55,709
Well, Marie has one, too.

433
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:58,355
Come on, girls,
those are not to play with.

434
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,284
Come on,
give it here and get some sleep.

435
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:02,361
But we were just waiting for Mommy.

436
00:25:02,486 --> 00:25:04,295
When is she coming to
give us our kisses?

437
00:25:04,463 --> 00:25:06,313
You give me the flashlight.

438
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,309
Your kisses?
You already got your kisses tonight.

439
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:12,216
Not from Mom.

440
00:25:12,388 --> 00:25:14,889
She's been in her room
since after dinner.

441
00:25:15,502 --> 00:25:17,005
Mommy's sad.

442
00:25:17,329 --> 00:25:19,338
Mommy's just extra tired tonight.

443
00:25:19,554 --> 00:25:23,065
Come on, now, go to sleep so we can get
a fresh start in the morning, all right?

444
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,180
It's so hard to get
it out of your head.

445
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:29,444
What happened to that family...
it was so...

446
00:25:30,307 --> 00:25:33,030
it was so cruel, so inhumane,

447
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,213
like someone just disposed of them.

448
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:39,784
How could someone do that
to another person?

449
00:25:40,777 --> 00:25:42,213
To a family?

450
00:25:42,664 --> 00:25:43,714
To a child?

451
00:25:45,618 --> 00:25:47,837
Maybe you should give it
a rest for tonight.

452
00:25:48,963 --> 00:25:51,041
You know,
it's enough to put you off people,

453
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,199
make you wish someone would just...

454
00:25:54,531 --> 00:25:56,472
wipe the slate clean
once and for all.

455
00:25:57,986 --> 00:25:59,140
You don't mean that.

456
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:10,808
Oh, damn it.

457
00:27:08,257 --> 00:27:09,299
Hello?

458
00:27:09,424 --> 00:27:11,537
Hello, is anybody home?

459
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:23,350
Zoey.

460
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:29,959
What...?

461
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:32,567
What is this?

462
00:27:35,499 --> 00:27:37,198
Those people are alive.

463
00:27:39,146 --> 00:27:40,241
Everything's fine.

464
00:27:40,996 --> 00:27:42,146
This is true.

465
00:27:49,008 --> 00:27:50,358
I'm sorry, let...

466
00:27:51,025 --> 00:27:53,522
let me make sure
I'm following you correctly.

467
00:27:54,367 --> 00:27:56,942
You're saying that this man you met
somehow convinced this young woman

468
00:27:57,067 --> 00:27:58,779
that the apocalypse
had come and gone?

469
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:00,660
That's exactly what he did.

470
00:28:01,773 --> 00:28:05,466
This girl's been coming in my dreams.
I misunderstood what she was showing me.

471
00:28:05,826 --> 00:28:09,499
I thought I was seeing the future.
Actually, I was seeing this girl's past.

472
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:11,433
This girl's prints
are in the system.

473
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:13,793
We should know
who she is in about eight hours.

474
00:28:13,918 --> 00:28:16,359
Once we do, we can try and connect her
to Russell Burgess,

475
00:28:16,484 --> 00:28:18,071
start building a case against him.

476
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,724
I don't need to wait eight hours.

477
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:22,159
I know for a fact,
right now, he killed her.

478
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,254
I'm sorry, the end of the world?
That seems like a lot to fall for.

479
00:28:26,657 --> 00:28:28,749
This girl, whoever she was,
was no kid.

480
00:28:29,013 --> 00:28:31,128
Well,
she wasn't a kid when she died,

481
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:34,908
but in my dreams, it seemed like she had
been down in that bunker a long time.

482
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:37,591
Who knows how old she was
when Burgess took her?

483
00:28:37,957 --> 00:28:39,507
Okay, explain to me why.

484
00:28:40,293 --> 00:28:42,171
Why keep this girl
alive all those years?

485
00:28:42,296 --> 00:28:44,311
Why would anyone go
to all that trouble?

486
00:28:44,436 --> 00:28:46,469
He gets to be
someone's entire world.

487
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:49,530
I don't know, maybe he thinks
something terrible is going to happen,

488
00:28:49,655 --> 00:28:52,773
and he gets to add a girl
to his stockpile of provisions.

489
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:54,265
I don't know.

490
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,626
Maybe we should ask him.

491
00:28:58,721 --> 00:28:59,721
I'm sorry.

492
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:01,322
I wish I could help you,

493
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,653
but she doesn't look
at all familiar.

494
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,660
I mean, she might have
come in the store, but...

495
00:29:08,015 --> 00:29:11,135
When and if you do get her name,
I'd be happy to look at the files,

496
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,793
credit card receipts.

497
00:29:15,152 --> 00:29:16,213
Anything else?

498
00:29:16,469 --> 00:29:17,990
Before she was murdered,

499
00:29:18,287 --> 00:29:21,508
we have reason to believe that this girl
was held prisoner for quite some time.

500
00:29:21,633 --> 00:29:24,805
We think she may have been held in
some kind of an underground shelter.

501
00:29:25,352 --> 00:29:27,473
Given your line of work,
your interest in survival,

502
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:31,101
I was wondering if you had
an underground shelter or a bunker of...

503
00:29:31,226 --> 00:29:33,105
some kind on your property.

504
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,820
I'm sorry.

505
00:29:35,964 --> 00:29:37,683
Is that what I'm doing here?

506
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:40,323
I came in because this lady,
a customer of mine...

507
00:29:40,448 --> 00:29:42,501
she called me up and said
I might be able to help you

508
00:29:42,626 --> 00:29:44,562
with some kind of investigation,

509
00:29:44,687 --> 00:29:46,535
but now it seems like
you're accusing me.

510
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:48,787
Just want to know
if you have a bunker.

511
00:29:49,102 --> 00:29:50,924
No, I don't have a bunker.

512
00:29:51,569 --> 00:29:54,126
I have a bomb shelter.
It was there when I bought the place.

513
00:29:55,442 --> 00:29:56,653
It's kind of a mess.

514
00:29:56,778 --> 00:29:59,631
I used to store kerosene down there
and we recently had a fire.

515
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,843
- You mind if we take a look?
- Be my guest,

516
00:30:04,334 --> 00:30:07,096
but you're not going to find anything
to do with any girl down there.

517
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:12,704
Who do you think you are?

518
00:30:14,177 --> 00:30:15,177
What's up?

519
00:30:15,302 --> 00:30:16,552
You lied to me.

520
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:17,917
Really?

521
00:30:18,648 --> 00:30:21,797
See, I kind of think I just told you
what you needed to hear.

522
00:30:21,922 --> 00:30:24,676
You and I both know that you would
have never helped me with that exam

523
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:26,579
if I admitted to you
that I stole it.

524
00:30:26,704 --> 00:30:28,593
You have no conscience, do you?

525
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,594
What if I tell Mr. Walsh?

526
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:37,579
You're not going to do that.

527
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:40,321
That might get you in
as much trouble as me.

528
00:30:40,762 --> 00:30:44,731
I mean, we both know that you're one of
those kids who has a great reputation.

529
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:47,152
Works hard, gets good grades.

530
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:48,679
Always has.

531
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:51,809
So no.

532
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:55,790
I don't see you risking all that just
to set the record straight on me.

533
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:57,848
And besides...

534
00:30:58,486 --> 00:31:00,784
might make it kind of awkward
when we get together on Friday.

535
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:02,611
We're not getting
together on Friday.

536
00:31:04,048 --> 00:31:05,398
Whatever you say.

537
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:08,108
Tell me something.

538
00:31:08,803 --> 00:31:12,329
A couple kids told me that you have
that sixth sense thing like your mother.

539
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:15,539
I don't know, maybe I do,
maybe I don't.

540
00:31:17,813 --> 00:31:19,597
Didn't do you much good with me.

541
00:31:19,722 --> 00:31:20,722
Did it?

542
00:31:26,873 --> 00:31:30,043
This one really doesn't taste like
peanut butter. How's the chocolate?

543
00:31:30,475 --> 00:31:32,855
- Where'd you get those?
- Oh, hi, Mommy.

544
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:36,050
We found them in the garage.
There was a whole backpack full of 'em.

545
00:31:36,175 --> 00:31:39,606
Thought Daddy talked to you about this.
They're supposed to be for emergencies.

546
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,815
How are we supposed to know
if they're any good

547
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,703
if we don't give 'em
a test run first?

548
00:31:43,828 --> 00:31:45,469
Well, are they any good?

549
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:53,537
I just spent an hour going through
Burgess' bunker. Think I've black lung.

550
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,860
What? Why?

551
00:31:54,985 --> 00:31:58,501
<i>The place is burned through and through.
Smells like the inside of a smokestack.</i>

552
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:01,668
<i>For what it's worth, there were no signs
of captives, recent or otherwise.</i>

553
00:32:01,793 --> 00:32:05,340
Yeah, but that fits. I saw the bunker
on fire. That's how that girl got out.

554
00:32:05,972 --> 00:32:07,947
I'm not saying I don't believe you.

555
00:32:08,072 --> 00:32:10,929
I'm talking about evidence.
There just... is none.

556
00:32:11,687 --> 00:32:14,469
What, so that's it?
We're just going to look the other way

557
00:32:14,594 --> 00:32:16,309
even though
this monster killed a girl?

558
00:32:16,608 --> 00:32:18,058
Today we are, yeah.

559
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,044
Oh, by the way,

560
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:23,658
I don't know if this is gonna make
you feel better or worse, but...

561
00:32:24,097 --> 00:32:27,013
we think we're finally able
to ID our mystery girl.

562
00:32:27,264 --> 00:32:29,536
We're 99% sure
her name is Zoey Lehman.

563
00:32:30,105 --> 00:32:31,908
Her parents live in Tempe. They...

564
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,369
reported her as a runaway
almost three years ago.

565
00:32:34,726 --> 00:32:38,407
<i>We're gonna need a DNA test to make it
conclusive, but, other than that...</i>

566
00:32:38,693 --> 00:32:41,561
<i>hey, if nothing else, at least
we can give her family some closure.</i>

567
00:32:41,686 --> 00:32:43,294
I guess that's something.

568
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,890
Thanks, Lee.

569
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,557
You okay?

570
00:32:57,665 --> 00:32:59,965
I don't think the world's gonna end.

571
00:33:00,632 --> 00:33:01,682
It's sad...

572
00:33:03,162 --> 00:33:05,528
that's the best
I can do for good news.

573
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,400
They finally did it.

574
00:33:07,525 --> 00:33:09,587
All that weapons-grade
plutonium out there,

575
00:33:09,712 --> 00:33:12,167
they were bound
to get their hands on some.

576
00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:15,322
I was friends with your dad
since we were kids.

577
00:33:15,946 --> 00:33:17,608
He knew I had this place.

578
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,178
He asked me...

579
00:33:21,212 --> 00:33:22,612
he made me promise

580
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:25,212
that I would protect you,

581
00:33:25,828 --> 00:33:27,478
and I gave him my word.

582
00:33:28,982 --> 00:33:29,982
Easy...

583
00:33:30,757 --> 00:33:31,757
easy...

584
00:33:39,815 --> 00:33:41,754
You're groggy from the sedative.

585
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,311
Your mom gave you that.

586
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,480
She didn't want you to panic.

587
00:33:48,811 --> 00:33:51,083
Knew there wasn't time
for a good-bye.

588
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,732
I know you're sad.

589
00:33:56,446 --> 00:33:57,996
I know you're scared.

590
00:33:59,888 --> 00:34:01,475
But we're gonna be okay.

591
00:34:02,425 --> 00:34:03,925
We have food, water,

592
00:34:04,139 --> 00:34:05,589
everything we need.

593
00:34:11,201 --> 00:34:12,951
I need you to promise me.

594
00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:15,693
No matter what,

595
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,980
you cannot leave this room.

596
00:34:18,904 --> 00:34:20,519
It's dangerous out there.

597
00:34:20,979 --> 00:34:21,979
Radiation.

598
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,040
Crazies with guns.

599
00:34:24,472 --> 00:34:26,022
You leave that to me.

600
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:30,169
I'll go and find whatever we need...
supplies, food, medicine.

601
00:34:30,975 --> 00:34:33,323
And at night,
I'll be back here with you.

602
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:36,372
And we'll get through this.

603
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:37,579
Together.

604
00:34:40,075 --> 00:34:42,725
I may well be the last
of my family alive.

605
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,059
And you may well be
the last Donlin...

606
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:48,458
Sarah.

607
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,662
But we're gonna get through this.

608
00:35:26,842 --> 00:35:29,871
We've searched every corner of
the place. No sign of Russell Burgess.

609
00:35:29,996 --> 00:35:31,436
His home was empty, too.

610
00:35:31,561 --> 00:35:34,997
My guess is he got spooked
when we brought him in for questioning.

611
00:35:35,405 --> 00:35:37,054
Odds are, he's long gone.

612
00:35:37,377 --> 00:35:40,091
And if Sarah Donlin's still alive,
he's probably got her with him.

613
00:35:40,216 --> 00:35:43,788
So it's true... he killed that whole
family so he could take their daughter.

614
00:35:43,913 --> 00:35:46,109
Well, he's smart.
I'll give him that.

615
00:35:46,314 --> 00:35:49,357
No one was gonna be looking for the girl
if they thought she was killed.

616
00:35:49,678 --> 00:35:53,682
We'll keep sifting, but I'd be surprised
if we find any sign of Burgess.

617
00:35:54,389 --> 00:35:56,752
He's the kind of guy
who knows how to fly below the radar.

618
00:35:56,877 --> 00:35:58,866
- He could be anywhere by now.
- Do you feel that?

619
00:35:59,515 --> 00:36:01,661
It's an aftershock.
Everybody watch out for your heads.

620
00:36:10,152 --> 00:36:11,352
Everyone good?

621
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,137
Honey, dinner.

622
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,095
Honey, did you hear me?
I said dinner.

623
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,360
I'm not hungry.

624
00:36:25,781 --> 00:36:27,061
Everything okay?

625
00:36:27,893 --> 00:36:29,771
You really don't know, do you?

626
00:36:32,005 --> 00:36:33,225
Don't know what?

627
00:36:34,106 --> 00:36:35,506
What I'm thinking.

628
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,139
What I'm feeling.

629
00:36:37,955 --> 00:36:40,679
Is this the part where I'm supposed
to say, "I'm not a mind reader,"

630
00:36:40,804 --> 00:36:43,246
and you're supposed to say,
"Well, yeah, you are"?

631
00:36:44,856 --> 00:36:47,066
What's the point of being able
to see things,

632
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:51,008
know things, when you can't choose what
you see and who you see them about?

633
00:36:52,185 --> 00:36:53,670
Did you misjudge somebody?

634
00:36:54,955 --> 00:36:56,005
Did I ever.

635
00:36:56,861 --> 00:36:58,129
A boy, maybe?

636
00:37:02,604 --> 00:37:05,745
Seems like a cruel trick,
doesn't it? This thing we have...

637
00:37:06,686 --> 00:37:09,665
doesn't really help when it comes
to people that we're close to,

638
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,689
people we want to be close to.

639
00:37:14,056 --> 00:37:16,484
Took me a while to figure out,

640
00:37:16,654 --> 00:37:19,986
but then I realized that whatever
it is that's speaking to me,

641
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:22,301
it speaks the clearest

642
00:37:23,698 --> 00:37:25,948
whenever I'm an innocent bystander.

643
00:37:26,865 --> 00:37:28,376
What's that old saying?

644
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:32,404
"A pool of water won't reflect
unless it's absolutely still."

645
00:37:33,445 --> 00:37:34,445
Great.

646
00:37:34,825 --> 00:37:36,878
Yeah, actually,
I kind of think it is.

647
00:37:38,134 --> 00:37:39,534
It means, usually,

648
00:37:41,154 --> 00:37:44,263
the people that we love most,
who mean the most to us...

649
00:37:45,825 --> 00:37:47,984
... that they can pretty much count
on the idea

650
00:37:48,109 --> 00:37:51,662
that whenever they're dealing with us,
they're dealing with the real us.

651
00:37:52,181 --> 00:37:55,176
We don't have any unfair
advantage in the relationship.

652
00:37:56,815 --> 00:37:58,415
And whatever happiness

653
00:37:59,516 --> 00:38:01,316
or heartache we've earned,

654
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,742
we've earned it fair and square,
just like they did.

655
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:09,038
God, you're smart.

656
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:11,584
No, I was just born first.

657
00:38:13,009 --> 00:38:14,059
So, dinner?

658
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:22,384
Just keep thinking about Russell Burges
and the Donlin girl,

659
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,693
or where they are,
or where they went.

660
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,452
Well, something's got to give.

661
00:38:31,577 --> 00:38:34,652
And they said on the news that every cop
in the state's looking for this guy.

662
00:38:34,777 --> 00:38:38,587
I wish that made me feel better. He's
been prepared his entire life for this.

663
00:38:38,712 --> 00:38:42,415
He can live off the grid as long
as he wants to, as long as he needs to.

664
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:46,610
And if she's alive,
he's got a 14-year-old Eve by his side.

665
00:39:11,604 --> 00:39:13,399
What's going on, Al? You okay?

666
00:39:13,524 --> 00:39:16,592
His footprints.
They were the same color as the paint.

667
00:39:17,005 --> 00:39:18,055
What paint?

668
00:40:20,738 --> 00:40:23,172
This is Detective Scanlon.
I'm gonna need backup.

669
00:40:23,526 --> 00:40:26,730
<i>Local store owner, Russell Burgess,
was taken into custody today</i>

670
00:40:26,855 --> 00:40:28,479
<i>following an investigation</i>

671
00:40:28,604 --> 00:40:31,976
<i>that revealed a hidden
living space in his store.</i>

672
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:36,467
<i>Now, Burgess was apparently using
the space to keep a 14-year-old girl,</i>

673
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:40,629
<i>believed to be the lone survivor of
the massacred Donlin family, prisoner.</i>

674
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:42,732
That poor girl.

675
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:45,729
What do you think's
gonna happen to her?

676
00:40:45,854 --> 00:40:47,954
She's got extended family,
thank goodness.

677
00:40:49,075 --> 00:40:52,743
I was at the hospital when they went
to visit her, and she looked...

678
00:40:53,526 --> 00:40:56,494
so happy.
She looked so relieved.

679
00:40:58,814 --> 00:41:01,584
And then, there was something else,
this look in her eye...

680
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:03,813
like at any moment...

681
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:07,173
it could all be taken away.

682
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,884
Wonder how long that will last.

683
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:11,891
For Sarah Donlin?

684
00:41:13,311 --> 00:41:14,461
I don't know.

685
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:18,933
You know, you can plan and prepare
for when things go wrong

686
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:21,347
up to a point,
but then you just got to live

687
00:41:21,472 --> 00:41:23,774
as best you can
in the moments you're given.

688
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,656
That was damned profound.

689
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:32,643
Thank you, would you like another?

690
00:41:32,768 --> 00:41:34,576
A stitch in time saves nine.

691
00:41:35,062 --> 00:41:36,769
Mm. You don't say.

692
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,343
'Tis better to give than to receive.

693
00:41:41,827 --> 00:41:43,282

694
00:41:43,407 --> 00:41:46,808

695
00:41:47,133 --> 00:41:50,579
Red sky at night,
sailors take flight.

00:41:50,704 --> 00:41:51,954
Okay, I'm over.
