1
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:10,770
Now she never even plays with him.

2
00:00:10,838 --> 00:00:13,239
She never plays with anything.

3
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:16,452
I'm afraid that your daughter's
increasing lack of affect

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,881
is all part of her ongoing
withdrawal from the world.

5
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:20,340
I don't know what that means--

6
00:00:20,407 --> 00:00:21,744
"withdrawal from the world."

7
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,228
Is she going through
some kind of depression?

8
00:00:27,296 --> 00:00:29,128
Can a 12-year-old even be depressed?

9
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,301
Doctor, I need someone to tell me
what's going on with my daughter.

10
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,496
Your daughter's having delusions,
hallucinations.

11
00:00:36,564 --> 00:00:38,391
She's displaying something

12
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:40,520
that we call "disorganized speech."

13
00:00:40,588 --> 00:00:42,618
And while I'm not about to diagnosis her

14
00:00:42,685 --> 00:00:44,015
from across the room,

15
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,813
I will tell you that these
are all classic symptoms

16
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:50,045
of early onset paranoid schizophrenia.

17
00:00:52,346 --> 00:00:54,847
Schizophrenia?

18
00:00:54,915 --> 00:00:58,784
It's clear to me that she's very, very sick.

19
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,817
I'm sorry, you're just wrong.

20
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:02,352
She's not sick.

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,020
She's just going through something.

22
00:01:09,227 --> 00:01:10,660
Oh, God.

23
00:01:10,728 --> 00:01:12,362
Summer, what have you done?!

24
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,492
He wouldn't stop talking to me.

25
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:15,031
There are so many things
wrong with that picture

26
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:17,533
that I don't even think I'm offended.

27
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:19,401
Yeah, what's wrong with it?

28
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:21,369
I think it's pretty good.

29
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:23,805
Well, first of all, I'm not a cheerleader.

30
00:02:23,873 --> 00:02:26,207
And second of all, I don't have buckteeth.

31
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:28,175
And third of all,
I don't walk around saying,

32
00:02:28,243 --> 00:02:30,844
"I'm Ariel, I'm Ariel!"

33
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:33,680
But other than that,
I think you, uh, you nailed it.

34
00:02:33,747 --> 00:02:35,014
It's a caricature.

35
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:37,049
It's not supposed to look exactly like you.

36
00:02:37,117 --> 00:02:40,752
It's supposed to tell the truth
about what you're like inside.

37
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,021
And you're right, I think I nailed it.

38
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,392
Good morning, all.

39
00:02:47,028 --> 00:02:49,362
Wow, Bridge, you did all those?

40
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,031
Looks like you've been really busy.

41
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:52,065
Yep.

42
00:02:52,132 --> 00:02:54,834
Why the sudden interest in art?

43
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:56,769
Please, Bridgette' not interested in art.

44
00:02:56,836 --> 00:02:59,371
Bridgette is interested in
Finn who is interested in art.

45
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,472
Hey!

46
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,773
Oh, yeah? Who's this Finn?

47
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:03,374
Bridgette's boyfriend.

48
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:05,543
He is not. He's not.

49
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,178
He's just a friend that happens to be a boy.

50
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:09,980
And, uh, it's not the same thing.

51
00:03:10,048 --> 00:03:11,014
Okay.

52
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:12,549
All right, if you say so.

53
00:03:12,616 --> 00:03:15,217
Does Mom know about this?

54
00:03:15,285 --> 00:03:17,786
Well, I was going to mention
it to her this morning,

55
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:19,487
but she got up and went to work

56
00:03:19,555 --> 00:03:20,755
before I got up,

57
00:03:20,823 --> 00:03:22,156
so I didn't get to.

58
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:23,624
Thank you.

59
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:25,659
Well, I'm here, and I'm all ears.

60
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:27,961
So tell me a little bit
more about this friend

61
00:03:28,029 --> 00:03:29,730
who happens to be a boy.

62
00:03:29,797 --> 00:03:31,364
He's really nice.

63
00:03:31,432 --> 00:03:33,433
And he sits in front of me in math class.

64
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,736
He's into a lot of the same
really cool stuff that I am.

65
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:40,138
He's really nice to me, too.

66
00:03:40,206 --> 00:03:43,374
He plays with me and
Bridgette on the playground.

67
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:45,341
Hmm, okay, I got it.

68
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:47,375
Finn is cool. Finn is nice.

69
00:03:47,443 --> 00:03:49,677
Come on, dishes into the sink.

70
00:03:49,745 --> 00:03:51,279
We're leaving in five minutes.

71
00:03:54,316 --> 00:03:55,016
See you later.

72
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:56,584
Okay, see you later.

73
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:57,652
Later, Pop.

74
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,654
Later.

75
00:03:59,722 --> 00:04:01,522
Morning, Keelin. Morning, Keelin.

76
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,492
Did you sleep well? Did you sleep well?

77
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:07,329
Do you think maybe this morning
Do you think maybe this morning

78
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:09,432
you could try to answer
you could try to answer

79
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,867
my questions my questions

80
00:04:10,935 --> 00:04:13,068
instead of repeating them?
instead of repeating them?

81
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:15,971
Any idea how this girl was able
to break out of this facility?

82
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:19,175
I mean, I know the name is
Mariposa Psychiatric Hospital,

83
00:04:19,243 --> 00:04:21,210
but it is part of the prison system.

84
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:22,512
Based on that tape,

85
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:24,981
that girls doesn't seem terribly aggressive.

86
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:27,049
To be honest, I'm a little flummoxed.

87
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:28,484
I think we both are.

88
00:04:28,552 --> 00:04:31,787
Well, obviously, we have a security presence

89
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,089
here at Mariposa Psych,

90
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:35,024
but in the wing where Keelin resides

91
00:04:35,092 --> 00:04:37,026
it's fairly benign.

92
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:39,328
Those patients are all
approaching the age of majority.

93
00:04:39,396 --> 00:04:41,330
They're within a year of being released.

94
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:42,798
So as part of their treatment,

95
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,633
they're afforded much more freedom

96
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,001
than the other wings enjoy.

97
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:50,038
And the vast majority of
our patients are minors,

98
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:53,675
so we see very few attempted escapes.

99
00:04:53,743 --> 00:04:56,611
I know that's not much help.

100
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:58,280
So, uh, who are we looking for?

101
00:04:58,348 --> 00:04:59,983
What can you tell us about her,

102
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,186
other than the fact that she
repeats whatever anybody tells her?

103
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:06,389
Well, her full name is Keelin McKinney.

104
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:11,560
And three years ago,
right before her 15th birthday,

105
00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:13,796
she had an affair with her history teacher.

106
00:05:13,863 --> 00:05:16,799
And about five months into it,

107
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:18,934
the history teacher broke it off.

108
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:20,635
A week later, she follows him home,

109
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:22,003
ties him up in his bed

110
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,072
and shoots him 12 times
with her father's pistol.

111
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:26,874
The police arrive.

112
00:05:26,942 --> 00:05:29,811
She's just sitting there, unresponsive,

113
00:05:29,878 --> 00:05:33,047
and she slipped into a catatonic state.

114
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:36,183
And, finally, two months ago,
she came out of it.

115
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:37,518
So that parroting that you saw

116
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:39,553
on the video-- that's called echolalia.

117
00:05:39,621 --> 00:05:41,355
We almost always encounter it

118
00:05:41,423 --> 00:05:42,857
when catatonic patients awaken.

119
00:05:42,924 --> 00:05:46,127
But having said that,
I've never seen the phenomena

120
00:05:46,194 --> 00:05:48,295
present itself in quite the
way it has with Keelin.

121
00:05:48,363 --> 00:05:51,565
The depth of her recall is extraordinary.

122
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:54,735
Sometimes she spends whole therapy sessions

123
00:05:54,803 --> 00:05:56,804
parroting the previous session.

124
00:05:56,872 --> 00:05:58,639
Or... she did.

125
00:05:58,707 --> 00:06:00,107
I don't understand.

126
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:02,910
All she could do was repeat
back what people said to her,

127
00:06:02,978 --> 00:06:05,179
and yet she's within a year of her release?

128
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:06,780
She was sentenced as a minor.

129
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:08,582
She's about to turn 18.

130
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,986
And strange as it seems,
the echolalia-- that's progress.

131
00:06:12,054 --> 00:06:13,921
After three years of total silence,

132
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:16,023
it's Keelin's way of
coming back into the world.

133
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:19,426
And you have no idea how
she was able to get out?

134
00:06:19,494 --> 00:06:22,830
Maybe she snuck in the
back of a delivery truck.

135
00:06:22,898 --> 00:06:24,064
Hitched a ride out.

136
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:28,302
Maybe someone left a wrong door open.

137
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:30,704
None of the orderlies or the guards

138
00:06:30,772 --> 00:06:31,938
are willing to admit

139
00:06:32,006 --> 00:06:34,007
they know anything about what happened.

140
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:35,675
I think they're afraid for their jobs.

141
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:37,711
But I'm hoping they'll be more cooperative

142
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:38,979
when policemen are asking the questions.

143
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:40,513
I'd be happy to talk to them

144
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:41,948
and take a look around.

145
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:44,817
Dr. Woodel, this girl Keelin,
what's your feeling?

146
00:06:44,885 --> 00:06:46,619
Do you think she's dangerous?

147
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:48,521
I'd like to say no.

148
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:50,156
That I'm confident that my work with her

149
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:51,724
has cured her of those impulses,

150
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:53,626
but I obviously misjudged Keelin.

151
00:06:53,694 --> 00:06:55,161
We all did.

152
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:59,398
So I can't answer that for sure.

153
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:01,500
So where do we start?

154
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:04,169
I thought maybe you could
check out the girl's room

155
00:07:04,237 --> 00:07:05,604
while I walk the grounds.

156
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:07,706
It's right upstairs, room 306.

157
00:07:07,774 --> 00:07:10,208
Maybe something will come to you, you know?

158
00:07:40,471 --> 00:07:44,206
âTª âTª

159
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:54,615
He wouldn't stop talking to me.

160
00:07:57,218 --> 00:07:59,620
You here about Keelin?

161
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:04,456
I can make myself scarce,
if you need some time to look around.

162
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:06,992
No, no, no, I was just leaving.

163
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,793
I'm Allison; I'm Allison Dubois.

164
00:08:08,861 --> 00:08:10,661
I'm with the District Attorney's Office.

165
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:12,463
Hi. Summer Lowry.

166
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:14,065
You folks making any progress?

167
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:15,900
Have any idea where she is?

168
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:18,903
No, no, not yet.

169
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,139
Poor Keelin-- she must be terrified.

170
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:25,275
Why do you say that?

171
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,077
I mean, she did run away.

172
00:08:27,145 --> 00:08:29,413
And the police seem to think
she might be dangerous.

173
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,547
Dangerous?

174
00:08:30,615 --> 00:08:32,215
Keelin?

175
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:35,018
They haven't met her.

176
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:37,354
I know what she did and all,

177
00:08:37,422 --> 00:08:39,189
but that was a long time ago.

178
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:41,024
Keelin was the sweetest person in here.

179
00:08:41,092 --> 00:08:42,359
She was my friend.

180
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:46,363
Crazy, right?

181
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:47,931
How can you be friends with someone

182
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:49,366
who hardly ever talks?

183
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:53,437
Well, the thought did cross my mind.

184
00:08:53,504 --> 00:08:56,807
We actually talked all the time.

185
00:08:56,874 --> 00:08:58,942
At least, I talked to her.

186
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,744
And she liked it, I could tell.

187
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:03,280
Believe it or not,

188
00:09:03,347 --> 00:09:06,316
I think it was helping her get better.

189
00:09:06,384 --> 00:09:08,184
And she helped me, too.

190
00:09:08,252 --> 00:09:11,488
Don't tell Dr. Woodel, but, you know,

191
00:09:11,555 --> 00:09:14,858
sometimes I liked talking to Keelin
more than I like talking to him.

192
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:16,326
Yeah?

193
00:09:16,393 --> 00:09:18,228
Summer, it's time for group.

194
00:09:18,295 --> 00:09:20,463
Well, I have to go.

195
00:09:20,531 --> 00:09:22,031
But look at whatever you'd like.

196
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:23,299
It was nice meeting you.

197
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:25,802
Yeah. Nice to meet you, Summer.

198
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:28,104
Well, I don't know what kind of work

199
00:09:28,172 --> 00:09:29,739
you're doing around here,

200
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:32,742
but it certainly seems
to be working for her.

201
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:35,411
Yeah, Summer's definitely come a long way.

202
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:38,047
Her parents must be so relieved.

203
00:09:38,115 --> 00:09:39,782
Oh, you don't know?

204
00:09:41,318 --> 00:09:45,020
Summer's parents are the
reason that she's here.

205
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:47,156
When she was 13, right about the time

206
00:09:47,223 --> 00:09:49,658
they began to suspect that she was ill,

207
00:09:49,726 --> 00:09:51,727
Summer snuck into their room
while they were sleeping

208
00:09:51,794 --> 00:09:53,428
and she stabbed them to death.

209
00:09:53,496 --> 00:09:55,597
<i>Bridgette Dubois!</i>

210
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:59,601
Bridgette Dubois,
do you have an answer for me?

211
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:02,137
Bridgette?

212
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:04,072
I'm waiting.

213
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,942
Okay...

214
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,178
Okay, what?

215
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:13,514
I see you furiously
scribbling in your notebook.

216
00:10:13,582 --> 00:10:15,850
I can only assume you figured out what X is.

217
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:20,488
Um, let me see.

218
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,927
Any time now, Bridgette.

219
00:10:34,903 --> 00:10:36,170
Three?

220
00:10:36,238 --> 00:10:38,405
Very good, Bridgette.

221
00:10:38,473 --> 00:10:41,842
I'm glad to see you were paying attention.

222
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:45,612
Thank you.

223
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:49,516
Thanks. I owe you one.

224
00:10:49,584 --> 00:10:50,817
Yeah, it's okay.

225
00:10:50,885 --> 00:10:52,752
I just hope you were spaced out

226
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,386
'cause you were working on another cartoon.

227
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,188
Mr. Marcotullio this time.

228
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,989
I think I nailed him.

229
00:11:05,263 --> 00:11:07,130
Aren't you going to let me see it?

230
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:08,998
Nope.

231
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:11,133
Not good enough. It's not ready.

232
00:11:11,201 --> 00:11:12,968
It's okay.

233
00:11:13,036 --> 00:11:14,970
Show it to me when you're ready.

234
00:11:15,038 --> 00:11:16,305
If I survive gym class,

235
00:11:16,373 --> 00:11:17,940
I'll see you and Marie at lunch, okay?

236
00:11:18,007 --> 00:11:19,174
Yeah, sure.

237
00:11:19,242 --> 00:11:20,542
See you then.

238
00:11:26,114 --> 00:11:27,514
Okay. Okay.

239
00:11:27,582 --> 00:11:29,950
Keelin, I'd like to change the subject.

240
00:11:30,018 --> 00:11:32,819
Let's talk about your parents.

241
00:11:32,887 --> 00:11:34,821
Do you ever think about your childhood?

242
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:36,589
Your relationship with your mom and dad?

243
00:11:36,657 --> 00:11:40,560
Your relationship with your mom and dad?

244
00:11:40,628 --> 00:11:43,930
This is that girl-- Keelin McKinney--

245
00:11:43,998 --> 00:11:46,732
the one who went missing from
Mariposa Psych last night.

246
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,135
Yeah, I have to say I'm impressed.

247
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:53,906
If that girl recovered enough to run
away from a psychiatric hospital,

248
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:55,541
her doctor's a miracle worker.

249
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:58,143
You know, I met another
one of his patients today.

250
00:11:58,211 --> 00:11:59,812
A girl named Summer.

251
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,814
She murdered her parents six years ago.

252
00:12:01,881 --> 00:12:03,715
You wouldn't believe how far she's come.

253
00:12:03,783 --> 00:12:05,617
I mean, she seems like she could have been

254
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:06,785
one of Ariel's friends.

255
00:12:06,853 --> 00:12:09,588
But here's the thing that I don't get:

256
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:11,890
She killed her parents.

257
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,526
She slaughtered them in their beds.

258
00:12:14,594 --> 00:12:18,029
The memory of that's got to be
in there somewhere, doesn't it?

259
00:12:18,097 --> 00:12:20,432
How can she live with that?

260
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:22,400
How could she function?

261
00:12:22,468 --> 00:12:24,269
Don't look at me, I have no idea.

262
00:12:24,337 --> 00:12:26,104
I can barely function myself,

263
00:12:26,172 --> 00:12:29,808
and I haven't slaughtered anybody.

264
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,676
Not lately.

265
00:12:46,123 --> 00:12:49,125
Sweetie, what are you doing here?

266
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:19,284
911. What's the nature of your emergency?

267
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:22,653
I need the police right
away and an ambulance!

268
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:24,288
I think they're dead!

269
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:26,290
Oh, my God, I think she killed them!

270
00:13:26,358 --> 00:13:27,658
Sir, please calm down.

271
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,059
We'll get a car right out to you.

272
00:13:29,127 --> 00:13:30,361
Who is dead?

273
00:13:30,428 --> 00:13:32,229
My-my parents.

274
00:13:32,297 --> 00:13:35,366
She killed them. She finally snapped.

275
00:13:35,434 --> 00:13:38,703
My sister went crazy and killed my parents!

276
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:50,111
Oh, that's pretty.

277
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:52,179
I love impatiens.

278
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:53,580
Thanks.

279
00:13:53,648 --> 00:13:55,882
They've been letting me
take care of the garden

280
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,717
for a few years now.

281
00:13:57,785 --> 00:14:00,219
You're here with Keelin news, right?

282
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:03,122
Good news, right?

283
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,558
No news, I'm sorry to say.

284
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:10,595
Actually, I was wanting to talk
to you about something else.

285
00:14:10,662 --> 00:14:13,530
I know why you're here.

286
00:14:13,598 --> 00:14:15,198
I know what happened.

287
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:18,333
I'm curious.

288
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:21,702
How much do you actually
remember from that night?

289
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:25,572
I remember everything.

290
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,707
And I wish I didn't.

291
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,878
Honestly, I don't really
like to think about it

292
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:35,413
that much, Mrs. Dubois.

293
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,553
I was a very different person back then.

294
00:14:39,621 --> 00:14:42,657
I was very confused.

295
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:47,800
I had convinced myself that
my parents were imposters.

296
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:50,302
That evil people had replaced them

297
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,905
and were trying to do bad
things to me and my brother.

298
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:56,074
Actually, I wanted to talk
to you about your brother.

299
00:14:56,142 --> 00:14:57,809
What about him?

300
00:14:57,877 --> 00:14:59,278
Well, it's like you said--

301
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:04,216
you were a very different person then.

302
00:15:04,284 --> 00:15:06,652
You were confused.

303
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:09,721
I'm just wondering if you could think back,

304
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:11,757
think back.

305
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:15,026
Do you remember actually
seeing your brother that night?

306
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:19,964
Where are you going with this?

307
00:15:22,268 --> 00:15:25,837
Do you know how long I've been here?

308
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:28,706
Do you know how hard I've worked

309
00:15:28,774 --> 00:15:31,475
to get to the place where I am?

310
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:34,311
I mean, how crazy do you think I am?

311
00:15:36,146 --> 00:15:38,680
The night you're talking about,

312
00:15:38,748 --> 00:15:42,216
has been cauterized in my memory.

313
00:15:42,284 --> 00:15:45,455
And you're implying that
the only living relative

314
00:15:45,523 --> 00:15:48,826
that I have left may have been a part of it?

315
00:15:48,894 --> 00:15:52,396
And that maybe I don't remember?

316
00:15:54,733 --> 00:15:57,868
Mrs. Dubois, on your way out today

317
00:15:57,936 --> 00:16:00,804
you might seriously consider
trading in your visitor's badge

318
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:03,073
for a room assignment.

319
00:16:16,186 --> 00:16:17,687
Did you see Marie?

320
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:19,121
She's out there somewhere.

321
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:21,356
She'll be along in a minute.

322
00:16:21,424 --> 00:16:23,258
Hey, can I ask you a question?

323
00:16:23,326 --> 00:16:24,492
You just did.

324
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,127
Never mind.

325
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:27,528
Okay, I'm sorry.

326
00:16:27,596 --> 00:16:29,797
What?

327
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:33,702
When you like a guy, how do you know it?

328
00:16:35,338 --> 00:16:37,172
Wait-- who likes a boy?

329
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,174
I'm thinking maybe I do.

330
00:16:39,242 --> 00:16:41,410
You know, it's sixth grade.

331
00:16:41,478 --> 00:16:43,679
Boys just can't be friends
with girls anymore,

332
00:16:43,747 --> 00:16:45,982
and girls just can't be friends with boys.

333
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:48,951
And everyone's starting
to like someone, like--

334
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:50,486
"like," like.

335
00:16:50,553 --> 00:16:52,220
It's weird.

336
00:16:52,288 --> 00:16:56,091
I didn't think I was into any
of this stuff, but then...

337
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:58,727
I drew this.

338
00:17:06,237 --> 00:17:08,471
Wow.

339
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:12,342
I, um... I guess you might
really like this guy.

340
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,978
Really?

341
00:17:14,045 --> 00:17:16,213
'Cause I don't feel any different.

342
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:18,883
And the weirdest thing is,

343
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,684
I don't even remember writing it down.

344
00:17:20,752 --> 00:17:24,355
I mean, I just looked down and there it was.

345
00:17:24,422 --> 00:17:28,925
Yeah, liking guys can make us
do some really strange stuff.

346
00:17:28,993 --> 00:17:32,296
So how do I make it stop?

347
00:17:32,364 --> 00:17:35,766
You like this guy.

348
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:38,202
And you can't turn that off.

349
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,838
So maybe you should try
hanging out with him.

350
00:17:40,906 --> 00:17:43,107
See if maybe he feels the same way.

351
00:17:43,175 --> 00:17:44,275
Well, what do you mean?

352
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:45,977
I'm already hanging out with him.

353
00:17:46,045 --> 00:17:51,449
I know, but now that you like him,
it's gonna be different.

354
00:17:51,517 --> 00:17:52,917
Different how?

355
00:17:57,188 --> 00:17:59,690
I can't explain.

356
00:17:59,758 --> 00:18:02,226
But it's um, it's gonna be different.

357
00:18:02,294 --> 00:18:04,795
So I have to keep doing
what I'm already doing,

358
00:18:04,863 --> 00:18:05,896
except now it's different

359
00:18:05,964 --> 00:18:08,098
in some way that you can't explain to me?

360
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,634
Yeah.

361
00:18:10,702 --> 00:18:14,905
I'm never going to get rid of this, am I?

362
00:18:14,972 --> 00:18:17,006
Of course I remember Summer Lowry.

363
00:18:17,074 --> 00:18:21,076
I handled the plea bargain
that led to her committal.

364
00:18:21,144 --> 00:18:24,379
And I was present when she confessed

365
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:25,813
to the killing of her parents.

366
00:18:25,881 --> 00:18:29,183
Look...

367
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,485
you and I have far too much history together

368
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:33,653
for me to just dismiss out of hand

369
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:35,888
something you've dreamt,
but there is precious little

370
00:18:35,956 --> 00:18:38,591
to suggest that anybody got anything wrong

371
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:39,792
in this particular case.

372
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,427
At the time of her committal,

373
00:18:41,494 --> 00:18:44,330
Summer Lowry was a deeply
disturbed young woman.

374
00:18:44,397 --> 00:18:46,465
And she had a very well documented history

375
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:48,133
of violent behavior.

376
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:50,102
And she confessed to the crime.

377
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,703
Her brother Chad, on the other hand,

378
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:54,039
was anonor student, he was grief stricken,

379
00:18:54,107 --> 00:18:56,675
and no one who knew him,
even for just a minute,

380
00:18:56,742 --> 00:18:57,742
entertained the idea

381
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,144
that he might have been involved.

382
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:01,646
Well, I know it sounds
like it's from left field,

383
00:19:01,714 --> 00:19:04,282
but there was nothing
vague about what I saw.

384
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,685
It was completely unambiguous.

385
00:19:06,753 --> 00:19:09,654
He committed the killings,
and she was nowhere in sight.

386
00:19:09,722 --> 00:19:11,356
Be that as it may,

387
00:19:11,424 --> 00:19:13,859
unless you have some evidence
that you haven't shown me yet--

388
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:16,796
something to prove that
what you've seen is true--

389
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:20,066
there's nothing I can do, Allison.

390
00:19:23,237 --> 00:19:24,604
Hello.

391
00:19:24,672 --> 00:19:26,673
You want some good news or bad news?

392
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,840
Lee...

393
00:19:27,908 --> 00:19:29,642
Good or bad, you gotta call it.

394
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,611
All right, good, give me the good.

395
00:19:31,678 --> 00:19:33,012
And you better not disappoint.

396
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,081
You know that girl who
escaped from Mariposa Psych,

397
00:19:35,148 --> 00:19:36,482
Keelin McKinney?

398
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,216
I'm hot on her trail.

399
00:19:38,284 --> 00:19:40,617
Turns out she paid a visit
to her shrink last night.

400
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:42,483
You're right, that is excellent news.

401
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:44,917
But what's the bad?

402
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:48,517
Dr. Woodel left the windows
in his house unlocked.

403
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:50,151
We think that's how she got in.

404
00:19:50,219 --> 00:19:52,086
The housekeeper found him around noon.

405
00:19:52,153 --> 00:19:54,587
He was lying in bed,
his wrists tied to the headboard

406
00:19:54,655 --> 00:19:58,156
stabbed to death with a
knife from his own kitchen.

407
00:19:58,224 --> 00:19:59,523
The whole scene was littered

408
00:19:59,591 --> 00:20:01,091
with Keelin's hair and fingerprints.

409
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,460
I just don't understand.

410
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:05,395
Why would she kill her therapist?

411
00:20:05,462 --> 00:20:08,631
Well, we're talking about
an escaped mental patient.

412
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:12,234
This girl was committed
because she got obsessed

413
00:20:12,302 --> 00:20:14,269
with her teacher, before she killed him.

414
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:16,837
Maybe she got obsessed with this guy, too.

415
00:20:16,905 --> 00:20:20,073
Anyway, we know who did it.

416
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:22,342
Now we just have to find her.

417
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:24,343
Girls, come on,
what are you doing back there?

418
00:20:24,411 --> 00:20:25,478
Dinner's ready.

419
00:20:25,545 --> 00:20:28,080
Wow!

420
00:20:28,148 --> 00:20:29,248
Wow, look at you.

421
00:20:29,316 --> 00:20:30,616
You look so pretty.

422
00:20:30,684 --> 00:20:31,918
What is this all about?

423
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:33,385
We're giving my face a test run.

424
00:20:33,453 --> 00:20:34,653
I'm going over to Finn's house

425
00:20:34,721 --> 00:20:36,021
on Saturday, to watch a movie.

426
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:38,456
Well, I think the test is going quite well.

427
00:20:38,524 --> 00:20:39,724
Thanks.

428
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:42,659
How about some dinner?

429
00:20:46,664 --> 00:20:48,198
Makeup?

430
00:20:48,266 --> 00:20:50,868
Bridgette is wearing makeup?

431
00:20:50,935 --> 00:20:52,536
Our Bridgette?

432
00:20:52,604 --> 00:20:53,905
Help me out here.

433
00:20:53,972 --> 00:20:55,573
Wasn't she just born?

434
00:20:55,641 --> 00:20:58,042
Didn't we just bring her
home from the hospital?

435
00:20:58,109 --> 00:20:59,576
I'm sorry, Daddy.

436
00:20:59,644 --> 00:21:01,778
Your little girl likes a little boy.

437
00:21:01,846 --> 00:21:04,247
I know she can't spend her whole life

438
00:21:04,314 --> 00:21:07,149
as a conscientious objector
in the war between the sexes,

439
00:21:07,217 --> 00:21:10,351
but doesn't this seem-- I don't know, fast?

440
00:21:12,955 --> 00:21:14,822
This doesn't alarm you?

441
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,625
Our middle daughter-- boys?

442
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,360
Hey, I'm a reformed boy myself.

443
00:21:19,427 --> 00:21:20,661
And let me tell you something--

444
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:22,497
if you're not worried, you ought to be.

445
00:21:22,564 --> 00:21:25,934
Come on, it's cute.

446
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:28,603
Besides, there's nothing we can do about it.

447
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,704
And there's nothing reformed about you.

448
00:21:36,676 --> 00:21:38,243
No, please. Why are you doing this?

449
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:40,279
Doctor, come on,
I think we both know damn well

450
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:41,280
why I'm doing this.

451
00:21:41,347 --> 00:21:42,480
No, I don't.

452
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:45,116
You can just let me go. Untie me, walk away.

453
00:21:45,184 --> 00:21:47,018
Please, I won't tell anybody what I know.

454
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:49,787
I certainly won't tell them
that you killed your parents.

455
00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:51,623
Of course you'd say that now,

456
00:21:51,691 --> 00:21:53,125
but you weren't exactly reassuring

457
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:55,394
when you came to see me a few weeks ago.

458
00:21:55,462 --> 00:21:57,830
Back then it was, "Give me
half of everything you've got

459
00:21:57,898 --> 00:22:00,333
or I'm going to the police."

460
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,336
You even got that tape with
her talking about it all.

461
00:22:04,971 --> 00:22:07,841
But I don't want any more money, now, Chad.

462
00:22:07,908 --> 00:22:09,376
I'll give you those tapes.

463
00:22:09,444 --> 00:22:11,211
No one will ever know better.

464
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:13,180
You're right about that much.

465
00:22:13,247 --> 00:22:14,381
Stop.

466
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:16,717
You can't just kill me.

467
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:18,653
Think it through, Chad.

468
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,254
They'll catch you.

469
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:23,257
You don't have some poor sick
girl to pin it on this time.

470
00:22:23,324 --> 00:22:25,726
Actually, I do.

471
00:22:25,793 --> 00:22:27,561
But this time her name isn't Summer...

472
00:22:29,663 --> 00:22:31,931
...it's Keelin.

473
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:35,500
You are going to tell me
where those tapes are,

474
00:22:35,568 --> 00:22:38,369
in which case, Keelin's going
to kill you nice and quick,

475
00:22:38,437 --> 00:22:40,805
or you're going to put up a fight,

476
00:22:40,873 --> 00:22:43,507
which means Keelin's going to take her time.

477
00:22:50,158 --> 00:22:52,159
Now the brother didn't
just kill the parents,

478
00:22:52,227 --> 00:22:54,228
he's killed this girl Keelin McKinney

479
00:22:54,295 --> 00:22:56,263
and he killed Keelin
McKinney's psychiatrist?

480
00:22:56,331 --> 00:22:58,232
Well, think about it. He had to.

481
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:01,135
Dr. Woodel knew that
Chad was the real killer.

482
00:23:01,202 --> 00:23:03,003
And he was in the process
of blackmailing Chad.

483
00:23:03,071 --> 00:23:05,839
I'm sorry.

484
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:08,474
Okay, all right, let's assume

485
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:11,410
that you are correct about all of this.

486
00:23:11,478 --> 00:23:13,145
The blackmail, everything.

487
00:23:13,213 --> 00:23:15,616
That Summer confessed the
truth to her psychiatrist

488
00:23:15,684 --> 00:23:17,552
and he used it to blackmail the brother.

489
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,888
How in the hell did Chad
Lowry come into possession

490
00:23:19,955 --> 00:23:21,456
of Keelin McKinney's hand?

491
00:23:22,524 --> 00:23:25,092
I know, I know,

492
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,994
he sawed it off her arm after he killed her.

493
00:23:30,764 --> 00:23:33,065
There's an APB out on this girl.

494
00:23:33,133 --> 00:23:35,334
Every policeman in the
city is looking for her.

495
00:23:35,401 --> 00:23:36,935
Do you seriously think that Chad Lowry

496
00:23:37,002 --> 00:23:38,536
tracked her down before the police could?

497
00:23:38,604 --> 00:23:40,604
What if he didn't have to track her down?

498
00:23:40,672 --> 00:23:42,205
What if she came to him?

499
00:23:42,273 --> 00:23:44,674
I mean, he visits his sister
every week in the hospital.

500
00:23:44,742 --> 00:23:46,442
They probably know each other.

501
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:48,143
What if she came to him for help?

502
00:23:48,211 --> 00:23:52,846
I don't know what to tell you, Allison.

503
00:23:52,914 --> 00:23:55,181
The Lowry murder is a closed case.

504
00:23:55,249 --> 00:23:56,416
The murderer confessed,

505
00:23:56,483 --> 00:23:58,550
and even she doesn't dispute what happened.

506
00:23:58,618 --> 00:24:00,152
The killing of the psychiatrist

507
00:24:00,219 --> 00:24:01,753
seems pretty open and shut, as well.

508
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,221
I would love to show you
some support in all of this,

509
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:07,758
but if the guilty party
insists they're guilty...

510
00:24:07,826 --> 00:24:08,893
That's okay.

511
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,963
You know what, I know what I have to do.

512
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:12,800
I have to go back to Mariposa Psych.

513
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:15,036
Summer Lowry knows what happened
the night her parents died.

514
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,539
She obviously told her psychiatrist.

515
00:24:17,607 --> 00:24:19,841
She can tell me, too.

516
00:24:23,512 --> 00:24:27,148
Summer, It's Allison.

517
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,953
Summer, I know you're in there.

518
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,955
The front desk called you and
let you know I was coming.

519
00:24:35,023 --> 00:24:36,790
Please open the door.

520
00:24:38,526 --> 00:24:41,295
Summer, I'm coming in.

521
00:24:48,068 --> 00:24:50,569
I know you're upset.

522
00:24:50,637 --> 00:24:53,105
We're all upset.

523
00:24:53,173 --> 00:24:55,174
And obviously, I didn't know Dr. Woodel

524
00:24:55,242 --> 00:24:56,876
as well as you did, but...

525
00:24:56,943 --> 00:25:00,145
They said that Keelin did it.

526
00:25:00,213 --> 00:25:02,581
I can't believe that.

527
00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:05,117
Do you believe that?

528
00:25:07,621 --> 00:25:10,457
I-I know she killed that other man, but...

529
00:25:10,524 --> 00:25:12,358
I'll tell you what I think.

530
00:25:12,426 --> 00:25:14,594
I will tell you exactly what I think.

531
00:25:14,661 --> 00:25:17,931
But first, Summer,
you have to be honest with me.

532
00:25:17,998 --> 00:25:21,200
You have to tell me what you know.

533
00:25:21,267 --> 00:25:23,668
What are you talking about?

534
00:25:23,736 --> 00:25:25,671
You know what I'm talking about.

535
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:28,106
I think the same person
who killed Dr. Woodel

536
00:25:28,174 --> 00:25:29,407
killed your parents.

537
00:25:29,475 --> 00:25:33,311
But that doesn't make any sense.

538
00:25:33,379 --> 00:25:35,882
That makes perfect sense.

539
00:25:35,949 --> 00:25:40,553
What makes no sense is you protecting him.

540
00:25:40,621 --> 00:25:43,390
I mean, I know he's your brother,

541
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,891
but what is it?

542
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:46,393
Is he threatening you?

543
00:25:49,063 --> 00:25:51,297
Summer--

544
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:54,633
I think he killed Keelin, too.

545
00:25:56,369 --> 00:25:58,603
No.

546
00:25:58,671 --> 00:26:01,473
He's doing the same thing to her

547
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,741
that he did to you--

548
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:04,209
trying to get everyone to believe

549
00:26:04,276 --> 00:26:06,745
that she's a murderer.

550
00:26:08,648 --> 00:26:12,017
You said she was your friend.

551
00:26:12,084 --> 00:26:14,786
Don't you think you should
come forward for her?

552
00:26:17,155 --> 00:26:19,123
If it's your safety you're worried about,

553
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,991
we can, we can protect you.

554
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:23,160
I can't.

555
00:26:24,162 --> 00:26:25,228
I can't.

556
00:26:25,296 --> 00:26:27,230
Yes, you can. Just tell me you will.

557
00:26:27,298 --> 00:26:31,300
I can't! I can't!

558
00:26:33,803 --> 00:26:35,837
Okay.

559
00:26:35,905 --> 00:26:38,140
Okay, okay.

560
00:26:38,207 --> 00:26:40,442
Just-just think about what I said.

561
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,711
And I'll call you on the phone

562
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:45,580
and we can talk about it tonight, okay?

563
00:26:52,555 --> 00:26:53,755
Can I come in?

564
00:26:53,823 --> 00:26:54,890
Go away. I'm busy.

565
00:26:54,957 --> 00:26:57,259
I need you to look at something.

566
00:26:57,326 --> 00:26:59,260
I told you I'm busy.

567
00:26:59,328 --> 00:27:02,063
Look at these two books.

568
00:27:02,131 --> 00:27:03,765
Okay, I'm looking.

569
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:05,567
So what am I supposed to see?

570
00:27:05,635 --> 00:27:07,635
You remember that, right?

571
00:27:07,703 --> 00:27:09,270
Yes.

572
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:11,239
Okay, now look at this.

573
00:27:11,307 --> 00:27:13,108
Okay.

574
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:19,215
You filled another notebook.

575
00:27:19,282 --> 00:27:21,183
You should be careful.

576
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,584
Finn might think you're a stalker.

577
00:27:22,652 --> 00:27:25,287
That's not my notebook, that's Marie's.

578
00:27:25,355 --> 00:27:28,223
And she's got this book
filled with this stuff.

579
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:29,858
Pages and pages.

580
00:27:29,926 --> 00:27:32,060
And I think she's been doing it a while.

581
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:35,230
So what's your point?

582
00:27:35,298 --> 00:27:37,999
My point is, I think that the reason

583
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:41,569
that I don't remember doing it,
is because I didn't do it.

584
00:27:41,637 --> 00:27:43,772
I think this page belongs to Marie

585
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:46,674
and somehow ended up in my book.

586
00:27:46,742 --> 00:27:50,979
I think she's the one who's
in love with Finn-- not me.

587
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:54,515
Wait a minute, Bridge,

588
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:57,618
just because you didn't write his name
a hundred times on a piece of paper,

589
00:27:57,686 --> 00:27:59,820
does not mean that you don't like him.

590
00:28:02,457 --> 00:28:05,960
Hey, say something. You're scaring me.

591
00:28:06,027 --> 00:28:07,995
I don't know what to say, okay?

592
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,163
I'm just upset.

593
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:11,232
What are you upset about?

594
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:14,902
I mean, first you tell me that you don't
like the way it feels to like a boy,

595
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,938
and then when it turns out that maybe
you don't like him you get upset.

596
00:28:18,006 --> 00:28:19,206
So, Bridgette, make up your mind.

597
00:28:19,274 --> 00:28:21,709
I did make up my mind.

598
00:28:21,776 --> 00:28:23,444
And I know what I said.

599
00:28:23,511 --> 00:28:27,514
: I know that I said that
liking a boy felt weird.

600
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:33,019
Then it started to make me feel,
I don't know, normal for once.

601
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:39,259
Bridgette, well,
then-then maybe you do like him.

602
00:28:40,294 --> 00:28:43,096
No.

603
00:28:43,163 --> 00:28:45,732
This is Marie's, not mine.

604
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,667
Finn's not mine either.

605
00:28:51,205 --> 00:28:53,472
What do you mean she won't speak with me?

606
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,508
I was there today.

607
00:28:55,576 --> 00:28:58,444
We had a plan to speak tonight.

608
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:02,515
Are you sure you have the right patient--

609
00:29:02,582 --> 00:29:04,383
Summer Lowry?

610
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,684
My name is Dubois.

611
00:29:05,752 --> 00:29:08,687
Allison Dubois.

612
00:29:08,755 --> 00:29:10,089
But can you just check again?

613
00:29:10,157 --> 00:29:11,190
It's really important.

614
00:29:11,258 --> 00:29:12,358
Hey.

615
00:29:12,426 --> 00:29:13,693
Hey. Yeah?

616
00:29:13,761 --> 00:29:15,095
She won't speak with me.

617
00:29:15,163 --> 00:29:16,697
They said she won't take my call.

618
00:29:21,336 --> 00:29:23,571
No, I understand.

619
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:25,940
Um... can you just do me a favor?

620
00:29:26,008 --> 00:29:27,709
Make sure she's got my number

621
00:29:27,777 --> 00:29:29,611
and let her know if she changes her mind,

622
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,581
that I'll be here and I would
love to speak with her.

623
00:29:35,752 --> 00:29:37,119
Thanks.

624
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:43,626
They said you needed to see me right away.

625
00:29:43,694 --> 00:29:45,095
So what do you want, Summer.

626
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:47,230
I usually don't get up
for another few hours.

627
00:29:47,298 --> 00:29:48,732
I hope this is important.

628
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,665
I like this time of day.

629
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:53,333
Just before the sun gets too bright.

630
00:29:53,401 --> 00:29:54,999
What do you want?

631
00:29:56,633 --> 00:29:59,700
I'm done covering up for you.

632
00:29:59,768 --> 00:30:01,633
What are you talking about?

633
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:03,568
I've been so stupid.

634
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:06,137
Keeping your secret for so long.

635
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:08,139
I'm getting better, you know.

636
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,373
Stronger.

637
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:11,141
I'm finally ready to stand up to you.

638
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,709
To do what has to be done.

639
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,244
Shut up. You are making a scene.

640
00:30:14,311 --> 00:30:16,646
You shouldn't have hurt Keelin.
She was my friend.

641
00:30:21,484 --> 00:30:22,917
Oh, God...

642
00:30:22,985 --> 00:30:25,052
Hey, you're up.

643
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,122
I was letting you sleep,
but Scanlon's on the phone.

644
00:30:28,189 --> 00:30:29,723
He says it's urgent.

645
00:30:30,525 --> 00:30:31,725
Hello?

646
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:33,293
Allison, sorry to bother you on a Saturday,

647
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,561
but I think you might want to come meet me

648
00:30:35,629 --> 00:30:36,562
out at Mariposa Psych.

649
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,830
Oh, no, no, no.

650
00:30:37,897 --> 00:30:39,731
Summer Lowry's brother came to visit her

651
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:41,333
first thing this morning.

652
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,534
She attacked him with a gardening spade.

653
00:30:43,602 --> 00:30:46,537
Stabbed him three times before
the orderlies pulled her off.

654
00:30:46,605 --> 00:30:48,272
Chad Lowry's dead.

655
00:30:54,078 --> 00:30:55,411
Oh, Summer.

656
00:30:57,414 --> 00:30:59,948
The guy from the M.E.
's Office said it looked like

657
00:31:00,016 --> 00:31:01,516
she'd been sharpening her spade on concrete.

658
00:31:01,584 --> 00:31:03,018
Oh...

659
00:31:03,285 --> 00:31:05,653
It looks like she knew exactly
what she was going to do

660
00:31:05,721 --> 00:31:07,255
when her brother got here this morning.

661
00:31:07,322 --> 00:31:08,656
Where is she?

662
00:31:08,724 --> 00:31:10,458
They have her in isolation.

663
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:12,059
She's restrained.

664
00:31:12,127 --> 00:31:13,895
Apparently, she's been hysterical ever since

665
00:31:13,962 --> 00:31:15,629
they dragged her off her brother.

666
00:31:15,697 --> 00:31:18,866
I just finished talking with
the director of the hospital.

667
00:31:18,934 --> 00:31:21,268
Obviously Summer hasn't
made as much progress

668
00:31:21,336 --> 00:31:22,569
as everyone thought.

669
00:31:22,637 --> 00:31:25,105
But they... they finally calmed her down

670
00:31:25,173 --> 00:31:27,775
and she's starting to talk.

671
00:31:27,842 --> 00:31:30,544
Allison, did you tell that girl

672
00:31:30,612 --> 00:31:32,746
that you thought her brother
killed Keelin McKinney?

673
00:31:32,814 --> 00:31:34,848
I did.

674
00:31:34,916 --> 00:31:36,750
I did.

675
00:31:36,817 --> 00:31:39,419
But I saw him do it, sir.

676
00:31:39,486 --> 00:31:41,754
I-I just wanted to talk to her

677
00:31:41,822 --> 00:31:43,289
about what happened with her parents,

678
00:31:43,357 --> 00:31:45,557
so she could clear her name.

679
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:48,227
I-I was just trying to help.

680
00:31:59,173 --> 00:32:00,474
It's after 10:00.

681
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:02,209
You getting up today or what?

682
00:32:02,276 --> 00:32:04,043
It's Saturday.

683
00:32:04,111 --> 00:32:05,411
Leave me alone.

684
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:06,546
Nope.

685
00:32:06,614 --> 00:32:08,381
Stop sulking. Get up.

686
00:32:08,449 --> 00:32:10,684
You need to see something.

687
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:15,921
You left these in my room yesterday.

688
00:32:15,989 --> 00:32:18,857
And there is something
in here you should see.

689
00:32:18,925 --> 00:32:20,091
What are you talking about?

690
00:32:20,158 --> 00:32:21,625
That's my notebook.

691
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:24,193
What could be in that,
that I don't already know about?

692
00:32:24,261 --> 00:32:26,529
You recognize this?

693
00:32:29,566 --> 00:32:31,499
It's Finn.

694
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:33,535
Isn't it?

695
00:32:33,602 --> 00:32:35,169
And you drew it?

696
00:32:35,237 --> 00:32:36,870
Yeah. So?

697
00:32:36,938 --> 00:32:39,205
So it's good.

698
00:32:39,273 --> 00:32:41,674
And Marie didn't draw it, you did.

699
00:32:41,742 --> 00:32:44,110
Okay, tell me something I don't know.

700
00:32:44,177 --> 00:32:47,512
Bridgette, there's...
at least ten drawings like that.

701
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,047
All of Finn,

702
00:32:49,115 --> 00:32:51,782
and he's the only thing
I've seen you try to draw

703
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,851
without an extra eye or giant buckteeth.

704
00:32:53,918 --> 00:32:56,687
You draw him well.

705
00:32:56,754 --> 00:32:58,822
You take time.

706
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:02,025
You take care.

707
00:33:02,093 --> 00:33:03,927
And you look at those drawings,

708
00:33:03,995 --> 00:33:05,862
and you sense that they're
filled with feeling.

709
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,230
Really?

710
00:33:07,298 --> 00:33:10,667
Trust me, you like Finn.

711
00:33:10,735 --> 00:33:14,671
You, just you.

712
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:16,772
Welcome aboard.

713
00:33:21,847 --> 00:33:25,416
No fair. You can't stay out here all night.

714
00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:33,591
All I've heard for the last three hours

715
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:35,727
is how great Finn Milner is.

716
00:33:35,795 --> 00:33:37,663
Did you know that he can draw and paint,

717
00:33:37,731 --> 00:33:39,098
and skateboard and hold
his breath underwater

718
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:40,567
for almost two whole minutes?

719
00:33:42,238 --> 00:33:45,440
Please, I'm in serious need
of some adult conversation.

720
00:33:45,508 --> 00:33:48,911
I'm sorry, I don't want to talk tonight.

721
00:33:48,979 --> 00:33:51,849
I ruined a girl's life today, Joe.

722
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:54,618
I wanted to help her.

723
00:33:54,686 --> 00:33:57,823
I wanted to convince the world
that she wasn't a killer.

724
00:33:57,891 --> 00:34:00,125
And all I did was convince
her to become one.

725
00:34:00,193 --> 00:34:02,261
Become a killer?

726
00:34:02,329 --> 00:34:03,863
Did you use those exact words?

727
00:34:03,931 --> 00:34:06,833
All I cared about was solving the case.

728
00:34:06,901 --> 00:34:09,503
All I cared about was proving

729
00:34:09,571 --> 00:34:12,273
that Chad Lowry was the real murderer.

730
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:16,077
I didn't stop to think
whether getting to the truth

731
00:34:16,145 --> 00:34:18,680
was the right thing for Summer.

732
00:34:18,749 --> 00:34:20,550
I pressed her.

733
00:34:20,618 --> 00:34:23,020
She wasn't ready.

734
00:34:23,088 --> 00:34:26,290
Chad Lowry is dead because of me.

735
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:29,260
The man was a killer, Allison.

736
00:34:29,328 --> 00:34:33,465
Yeah, well, now his little sister is, too.

737
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:35,300
So I'd like to try something
new today, Keelin.

738
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:37,235
So I'd like to try something
new today, Keelin.

739
00:34:37,303 --> 00:34:38,470
It's good to hear your voice.

740
00:34:38,538 --> 00:34:39,971
It's always good to hear your voice.

741
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:42,273
But I want to hear what you have to say,

742
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:44,609
so I'm just going to stop talking

743
00:34:44,676 --> 00:34:46,644
and just listen.

744
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:47,879
Hear what comes out.

745
00:34:47,947 --> 00:34:50,582
Hear what comes out.

746
00:34:54,221 --> 00:34:56,322
You know what?

747
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:59,090
I really like you, Keelin.

748
00:34:59,158 --> 00:35:02,660
You are such a good listener.

749
00:35:02,728 --> 00:35:05,896
Even combing your hair is nice.

750
00:35:08,499 --> 00:35:11,267
It's like sharing a room with a doll.

751
00:35:11,335 --> 00:35:13,169
A doll that breathes.

752
00:35:14,939 --> 00:35:19,074
Oh, with everybody else I have to act.

753
00:35:19,142 --> 00:35:21,042
I know a lot of people say that,

754
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,611
but with me, it's true.

755
00:35:23,678 --> 00:35:26,079
Really true.

756
00:35:26,146 --> 00:35:29,515
And I get so tired of it sometimes.

757
00:35:29,582 --> 00:35:33,784
It takes a lot out of yo
u- acting all the time.

758
00:35:36,588 --> 00:35:38,755
I had to do so much work

759
00:35:38,823 --> 00:35:41,892
to figure out how to pretend to be sick.

760
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,728
I had to pretend that I
belong in a place like this,

761
00:35:44,796 --> 00:35:47,264
and I did not think that
people would believe me,

762
00:35:47,331 --> 00:35:49,165
but everyone did.

763
00:35:51,134 --> 00:35:53,801
My parents--

764
00:35:53,869 --> 00:35:56,804
they used to cry.

765
00:35:56,872 --> 00:35:58,372
And they would say,

766
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,843
"Summer, we don't understand
what's wrong with you."

767
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,578
Keelin, is this something
Summer said to you?

768
00:36:04,645 --> 00:36:07,480
Keelin, is this something
Summer said to you?

769
00:36:09,749 --> 00:36:12,049
But they believed me.

770
00:36:12,117 --> 00:36:15,085
Everyone believed me.

771
00:36:15,153 --> 00:36:18,689
I mean, I had to go ahead with everything

772
00:36:18,757 --> 00:36:21,225
after that, didn't I?

773
00:36:21,293 --> 00:36:23,927
I had the whole world fooled.

774
00:36:23,995 --> 00:36:27,564
They all thought that I was crazy.

775
00:36:27,632 --> 00:36:30,066
And now they think I'm getting better.

776
00:36:30,134 --> 00:36:32,870
I'm a really good actor, Keelin.

777
00:36:32,937 --> 00:36:35,105
When I get out of here,

778
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:36,974
I think I'm going to go to California

779
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:39,042
and I'm going to do movies.

780
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,545
I bet you my parents love me enough

781
00:36:41,613 --> 00:36:43,947
to buy a house in Beverly Hills.

782
00:36:47,318 --> 00:36:49,219
Oh, my God.

783
00:36:52,791 --> 00:36:53,925
Thank you.

784
00:36:53,993 --> 00:36:55,693
I'll knock if I need anything.

785
00:36:57,163 --> 00:37:00,365
I'm not supposed to have visitors.

786
00:37:00,433 --> 00:37:02,801
Yeah, well, they made a little--

787
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:05,137
a little exception for me.

788
00:37:05,205 --> 00:37:08,474
I'm sorry if I got you in trouble.

789
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:10,810
I had to do that to Chad.

790
00:37:10,877 --> 00:37:12,311
I had to.

791
00:37:12,379 --> 00:37:13,946
You certainly did.

792
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:16,783
So what kind of timetable
are we talking about here?

793
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,118
I mean, how long are you going
to string everyone along

794
00:37:19,186 --> 00:37:22,721
till you start convincing them
that you're getting better?

795
00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:25,457
What are you talking about?

796
00:37:25,525 --> 00:37:28,259
You know, I don't know how you do it.

797
00:37:28,327 --> 00:37:31,529
I mean, if I was in here, I would go crazy.

798
00:37:31,597 --> 00:37:35,733
They told me that you
can't even have any books.

799
00:37:35,801 --> 00:37:40,070
Which is why I decided to
pay you a little visit.

800
00:37:40,138 --> 00:37:43,073
I'm gonna tell you a little story,
if that's all right.

801
00:37:43,141 --> 00:37:48,143
Just to, you know, relieve the boredom.

802
00:37:49,945 --> 00:37:53,112
So, once upon a time,
there was a little girl.

803
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,482
She was 13 years old.

804
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,584
And her parents had everything.

805
00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:02,819
Which meant

806
00:38:02,886 --> 00:38:06,420
the little girl pretty much had everything.

807
00:38:06,487 --> 00:38:11,089
But for this little girl,
pretty much was not good enough.

808
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:13,357
She wanted it all.

809
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:15,791
But she didn't want to
have to wait to inherit it,

810
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:16,823
and she didn't want

811
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:19,521
to have to earn it herself.

812
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:22,455
She needed a shortcut.

813
00:38:22,523 --> 00:38:25,090
So she came up with a plan
with her older brother.

814
00:38:25,157 --> 00:38:30,691
She decided to pretend that she was crazy.

815
00:38:30,758 --> 00:38:33,559
And she was so good at it,

816
00:38:33,627 --> 00:38:35,793
that the whole world believed her.

817
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:38,095
So much so,

818
00:38:38,163 --> 00:38:41,698
that when her brother actually
murdered their parents,

819
00:38:41,766 --> 00:38:43,533
no one had any trouble believing

820
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,001
it was the crazy, sick little girl;

821
00:38:46,068 --> 00:38:48,736
that her demons had gotten the best of her.

822
00:38:48,803 --> 00:38:50,770
That she just had to get packed away

823
00:38:50,838 --> 00:38:53,806
and shipped off to a hospital,
so she could get all better.

824
00:38:57,644 --> 00:38:59,911
This story is stupid.

825
00:38:59,979 --> 00:39:01,979
It doesn't make any sense.

826
00:39:02,047 --> 00:39:04,381
Why would anyone want to be here--

827
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:07,617
locked up in a place like this?

828
00:39:07,684 --> 00:39:10,553
Because people like you,
once they're feeling better,

829
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:15,424
once they can handle the world,
well, they get to go home.

830
00:39:17,293 --> 00:39:19,829
It was just about to happen.

831
00:39:19,896 --> 00:39:22,431
Everything was going according
to the little girl's plan,

832
00:39:22,499 --> 00:39:25,101
but then she made one little mistake.

833
00:39:26,704 --> 00:39:29,439
She talked to her roommate.

834
00:39:29,507 --> 00:39:32,176
She told her everything.

835
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,880
You know, the little girl
thought that this was safe

836
00:39:34,948 --> 00:39:38,918
because the roommate-- she didn't speak.

837
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:40,953
She couldn't speak.

838
00:39:41,021 --> 00:39:43,890
Catatonic friends are great like that.

839
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:47,094
When Keelin started waking up,

840
00:39:47,162 --> 00:39:49,630
when you realized that she was repeating

841
00:39:49,698 --> 00:39:52,100
everything you said,
you must have been scared.

842
00:39:52,168 --> 00:39:54,037
Lucky for you

843
00:39:54,104 --> 00:39:57,040
that doctor didn't go
straight to the police.

844
00:39:57,108 --> 00:40:01,212
He just used everything he
knew to try to get rich.

845
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:05,417
But of course, he underestimated
how lucky and smart you are.

846
00:40:05,485 --> 00:40:08,855
Lucky because Keelin ran away.

847
00:40:08,922 --> 00:40:10,623
You're smart because, once that happened,

848
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:13,994
you had your brother kill Dr. Woodel.

849
00:40:14,062 --> 00:40:16,798
So everyone would think she did it.

850
00:40:16,865 --> 00:40:19,267
And just like that,
both of your problems were solved.

851
00:40:20,303 --> 00:40:23,672
I'm confused.

852
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,575
You said this was a story,

853
00:40:25,642 --> 00:40:28,678
but you keep using the names of real people.

854
00:40:28,746 --> 00:40:32,649
Is that to make it more entertaining?

855
00:40:32,716 --> 00:40:34,751
Yes. Hmm.

856
00:40:34,818 --> 00:40:38,788
to make it entertaining and fun.

857
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:41,424
And now I'm going to use my own name.

858
00:40:41,492 --> 00:40:45,929
You remember when I showed up,
started asking questions

859
00:40:45,997 --> 00:40:48,265
about your brother, about how
he might be the real killer?

860
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:50,601
When did you decide

861
00:40:50,668 --> 00:40:53,270
to kill him?

862
00:40:53,338 --> 00:40:56,273
That you actually had to
kill someone yourself?

863
00:41:04,215 --> 00:41:05,682
Are you done?

864
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,684
I don't know.

865
00:41:07,752 --> 00:41:09,319
How do you think it ends?

866
00:41:15,158 --> 00:41:18,792
She gets away with it.

867
00:41:21,262 --> 00:41:23,863
Well...

868
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,931
Yeah, you might be right.

869
00:41:28,301 --> 00:41:30,402
You know, there's one part of the story

870
00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:33,438
that still bothers me.

871
00:41:33,505 --> 00:41:36,040
What really happened to your friend Keelin?

872
00:41:36,108 --> 00:41:38,008
I mean, how did she get out of here?

873
00:41:38,076 --> 00:41:40,677
And how did your brother find her?

874
00:41:40,744 --> 00:41:43,946
Unless--

875
00:41:44,013 --> 00:41:47,049
she never really escaped.

876
00:41:47,117 --> 00:41:49,118
And she was here the whole time.

877
00:41:49,186 --> 00:41:53,957
And you killed her.

878
00:41:54,024 --> 00:41:56,492
You did it, didn't you?

879
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,294
She's still here.
She's still here somewhere.

880
00:41:58,361 --> 00:42:00,763
And I'm guessing it's in that little garden

881
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,164
that you love so much.

882
00:42:02,232 --> 00:42:04,769
It's a good place to bury a body,
don't you think?

883
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:11,108
This is the exciting part of the story.

884
00:42:11,176 --> 00:42:13,911
Soon we're going to find out if I'm right.

885
00:42:13,978 --> 00:42:15,981
'Cause I brought some police with me,

886
00:42:16,049 --> 00:42:18,756
and they-- they brought some dogs.

887
00:42:18,824 --> 00:42:22,493
The kind of dogs that can smell drugs

888
00:42:22,561 --> 00:42:24,695
and corpses.

889
00:42:27,499 --> 00:42:29,935
Oh, look...

890
00:42:30,003 --> 00:42:31,403
the dogs found something already.

891
00:42:31,471 --> 00:42:34,672
You bitch!

892
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,772
Now there you are.

893
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:37,906
There's the real Summer Lowry.

894
00:42:37,974 --> 00:42:39,408
Well, welcome back.

895
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:42,177
You know this hospital here,

896
00:42:42,244 --> 00:42:45,045
it's not bad, all things considered.

897
00:42:45,112 --> 00:42:47,679
But I don't think you're
going to be spending

898
00:42:47,747 --> 00:42:49,714
a lot of time here.

899
00:42:49,782 --> 00:42:53,250
I think you're going to be going to prison.

900
00:42:55,686 --> 00:42:58,855
And that-- that is the ending of the story.

901
00:42:58,922 --> 00:43:02,192
Bet you didn't see that coming.

902
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:07,063
Thanks. NovaFly

902
00:43:08,000 --> 00:44:00,000 
Thanks.
