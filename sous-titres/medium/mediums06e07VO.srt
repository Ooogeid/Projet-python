00:00:01,389 --> 00:00:02,656
<i>ariel:
onomatopoeia.</i>

2
00:00:02,724 --> 00:00:03,658
<i>bridgette:
what a dumb word.</i>

3
00:00:03,726 --> 00:00:05,460
<i>i didn't ask you
to judge it.</i>

4
00:00:05,527 --> 00:00:07,161
I asked you
to spell it.

5
00:00:07,229 --> 00:00:09,497
Well, that doesn't change
the fact that it's a dumb word.

6
00:00:09,565 --> 00:00:12,400
I mean, you gotta wonder
what was going on in the room

7
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:14,435
The day they needed
to make up that word.

8
00:00:14,503 --> 00:00:15,670
(chuckles)

9
00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:17,505
Is there really a room
where they do that?

10
00:00:17,573 --> 00:00:19,407
There's got to be. right?

11
00:00:19,475 --> 00:00:21,476
Just spell it.

12
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:25,279
O-n...

13
00:00:25,347 --> 00:00:26,948
There's more.

14
00:00:27,016 --> 00:00:28,149
(air horn blares twice)

15
00:00:28,217 --> 00:00:29,517
Thank you, mr. truck!

16
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:33,721
I don't understand.

17
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:36,090
What's he honking at me for?

18
00:00:36,158 --> 00:00:37,825
(air horn blares twice)

19
00:00:37,893 --> 00:00:39,627
It's a red light!

20
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:41,329
I don't control it.

21
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:42,764
I'll turn when it changes!

22
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:45,199
(air horn blares twice)

23
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:46,968
(truck engine revs,
car horn blares)

24
00:00:47,036 --> 00:00:48,102
Ah, excellent.

25
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,337
(both horns blare)

26
00:00:49,405 --> 00:00:51,673
(truck engine revving)

27
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:55,543
Hey! hey!
hey, what's going on?

28
00:00:55,611 --> 00:00:56,711
Hey.

29
00:01:00,082 --> 00:01:01,482
Stop! stop!

30
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:04,185
(tires screeching)

31
00:01:04,253 --> 00:01:05,687
Ariel, do something!

32
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:06,688
Stop! stop!

33
00:01:06,755 --> 00:01:07,689
(car horns honking)

34
00:01:07,756 --> 00:01:08,990
(shrieks)
stop!

35
00:01:09,058 --> 00:01:10,858
(horn blaring)

36
00:01:10,926 --> 00:01:13,494
(gasps)

37
00:01:13,562 --> 00:01:16,998
(sighs)

38
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:19,300
Talk to me.

39
00:01:19,368 --> 00:01:22,003
I just hate it
that she can drive.

40
00:01:22,071 --> 00:01:23,471
Ariel?

41
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:26,307
What are you talking about?
she's a really good driver.

42
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,875
I know.

43
00:01:27,943 --> 00:01:31,579
She doesn't take any big streets
to school, does she?

44
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:33,114
I don't think she can take
any really big streets

45
00:01:33,182 --> 00:01:34,549
On the way to school.

46
00:01:34,616 --> 00:01:36,117
<i>i don't think there are
any really big streets</i>

47
00:01:36,185 --> 00:01:37,685
On the way to school.

48
00:01:37,753 --> 00:01:39,287
I don't think there's
even a stoplight

49
00:01:39,354 --> 00:01:40,888
On the way to school.

50
00:01:40,956 --> 00:01:43,725
Come on. allison, come on.

51
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:45,059
It's 4:00 in the morning.

52
00:01:45,127 --> 00:01:46,394
You worked late.

53
00:01:46,462 --> 00:01:48,329
You only got home
an hour and a half ago.

54
00:01:48,397 --> 00:01:50,131
I'm sure it's just
a really bad dream.

55
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:52,333
Please. come on.
go back to sleep.

56
00:01:52,401 --> 00:01:54,001
You're right.

57
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:56,504
She couldn't go faster
than 20 miles an hour

58
00:01:56,572 --> 00:01:57,672
Even if she wanted to.

59
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,440
There's a stop sign
on every corner.

60
00:01:59,508 --> 00:02:01,542
Exactly.

61
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,979
Come on. you need some rest.
we both do.

62
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:11,586
It's easy for you to say.

63
00:02:14,523 --> 00:02:16,190
(phone rings)

64
00:02:21,396 --> 00:02:22,797
Hello?

65
00:02:22,865 --> 00:02:26,567
Man:
hello. i'm looking for
an allison dubois.

66
00:02:26,635 --> 00:02:27,869
This is allison dubois.

67
00:02:27,936 --> 00:02:29,370
May i ask who's calling?

68
00:02:29,438 --> 00:02:31,272
I'm with the phoenix pd.

69
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,707
Are you the owner

70
00:02:32,775 --> 00:02:35,643
Of a 1991 volvo station wagon,
dark cream?

71
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:37,211
Is something the matter?

72
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:39,046
Did you lend the vehicle
to anyone?

73
00:02:39,114 --> 00:02:41,149
Is it possible it's been stolen?

74
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:43,317
My daughter.
my daughter has it.

75
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:45,720
Why are you asking
all these questions?

76
00:02:45,788 --> 00:02:48,923
There's been an accident.

77
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:52,927
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

78
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,040
Ariel:
mom?!

79
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:48,310
They just came in the class
and told me what happened.

80
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:50,412
Joe:
hey.

81
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:53,949
I had to park
three blocks away.

82
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:55,917
Were you here when
this happened?

83
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,452
No. i had no idea.

84
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,821
They just, uh, they just
pulled me out of class.

85
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:01,823
You folks the owners
of the parked car?

86
00:04:01,891 --> 00:04:02,891
The wagon, yeah?

87
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,459
The girl who was
doing the driving

88
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:06,762
Said she recognized
your daughter from school.

89
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:11,900
Oh, yeah, i've-i've
seen her around.

90
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:14,770
I think she's, um,
a year behind me.

91
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,171
Apparently, she has
her learner's permit,

92
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,674
So mom let her get behind
the wheel to drive to school.

93
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:19,908
She was driving
down this street

94
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:21,376
Looking for a place
to pull over

95
00:04:21,444 --> 00:04:22,911
And a cat
crossed the road.

96
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,846
I guess she tried
to hit the brake,

97
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:26,982
Hit the gas instead, panicked,
jerked the steering wheel,

98
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,917
Went across the road
and plowed into your car.

99
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:30,886
It's pretty
cut-and-dry.

100
00:04:30,953 --> 00:04:32,854
Nobody hurt.
really about tow trucks

101
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:35,490
And insurance companies
at this point.

102
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:36,558
Thank you.

103
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:37,726
Okay, thanks.
thank you.

104
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:38,927
Mr. and mrs. dubois,

105
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:41,563
I'm lauren portman.
i'm jamie's mom.

106
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:44,199
And i could not be
sorrier about this.

107
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:46,535
Uh, well, you know,
the good news is

108
00:04:46,602 --> 00:04:49,471
That, you know, none
of the kids were hurt, so...

109
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,706
I'm joe dubois.

110
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:52,174
This is my wife allison.
this is ariel.

111
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:53,475
Hi.

112
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,609
Hi. and you're right,

113
00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:56,578
That is the most
important thing.

114
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:58,180
She's actually a
good little driver.

115
00:04:58,247 --> 00:05:00,382
I just think, you know,
being late for school

116
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,883
And that cat...
mom, it's okay.

117
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:04,886
So, um, i guess
this is the part

118
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:07,122
Where we exchange the
insurance information.

119
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,524
Right.

120
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:11,426
Of course, we are
completely at fault.

121
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:14,262
And i promise i
will make that clear

122
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,364
To the insurance company
when i call them.

123
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:18,533
My husband has his-- thanks--

124
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:22,904
His, uh, car here
if you need a ride somewhere.

125
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:24,506
Oh, no, we're fine.
you know how it is.

126
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:28,610
As long as the kids are
fine, everything's fine.

127
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,752
Okay, i'll ask.

128
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:39,121
What about any of this
is making you happy?

129
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:40,388
What makes you think
i'm happy?

130
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:41,656
Look at that.

131
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:43,692
You got that goofy
grin on your face.

132
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,094
You know that that
car of yours is

133
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:47,662
Pretty long
in the tooth.

134
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,498
I mean, i'm not
even sure

135
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:52,033
The insurance company is gonna
want to pay us to get it fixed.

136
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,468
They might just want
to write you a check

137
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:55,370
And, you know,
total the thing

138
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,372
And be done with it.

139
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,907
Well, they have to fix it,
don't they?

140
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:02,477
No, not if it costs more
than the car's worth.

141
00:06:02,545 --> 00:06:04,179
Well, it's like
that lady said,

142
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:06,948
As long as the kids
are fine...

143
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:08,049
You love that car.

144
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,584
Yeah, i do,
but you know

145
00:06:09,652 --> 00:06:11,419
About that horrible dream
i had last night.

146
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:14,556
The one where ariel and the kids
were killed in the car

147
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,259
On the way to school?
so, it can't happen now.

148
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:19,427
There's no car
for it to happen in.

149
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:21,029
Aha.

150
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:24,099
Ah, capisce. mm.

151
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:27,102
Well, we may be getting
ahead of ourselves.

152
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,336
We still gotta wait

153
00:06:28,404 --> 00:06:30,739
To hear from the body
shop and the adjusters.

154
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,208
Oh, hey, by the way, was there
anything in that dream

155
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:35,076
About how we're supposed
to pay for whatever it is

156
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,845
We buy to replace the
car that you love

157
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:41,016
But that you're now
convinced is a death trap?

158
00:06:41,884 --> 00:06:43,418
Take that as a no.

159
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,154
You sure you're okay with
me just dropping you off

160
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:47,355
At the car rental place?

161
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:49,191
You don't want me to
go in there with you?

162
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:51,526
Oh, please,
i know how to rent a car.

163
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:52,794
I can rent a car.

164
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:54,162
I'm not... okay.

165
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,430
(chuckles)

166
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:59,401
Sorry, ma'am,
but it's after 10:00.

167
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:02,470
I'm afraid your options
are gonna be pretty limited.

168
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:04,606
In fact, i'm showing
that we have nothing.

169
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,308
Are you serious?
(chuckles)

170
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,044
My husband just
dropped me off.

171
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:10,312
I've no way of
getting home.

172
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:11,446
You know what?

173
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,315
Let's go out there
and take a look.

174
00:07:17,987 --> 00:07:19,921
That's it?

175
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:22,524
Kinda looks like
more than i need.

176
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:24,025
Rental agent:
wow. i don't even see
it on the manifest.

177
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:25,493
Must have just
come back in.

178
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:27,529
You want me to clean it up?
(cell phone rings)

179
00:07:27,597 --> 00:07:29,698
Everything okay, ma'am?

180
00:07:29,765 --> 00:07:31,066
I'm sorry.
somebody from work.

181
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:32,334
They want me
to meet them.

182
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:34,035
Do you know where
thunderhead pass is?

183
00:07:34,103 --> 00:07:36,471
No, but that's okay.
this guy's got a nav system.

184
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,173
Hell, these terrains have
everything in them.

185
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:40,175
Do you want me to clean it up?

186
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:43,044
Actually, maybe i'll just
take it the way it is.

187
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:52,587
(horn honking)

188
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,767
Nice wheels.

189
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:06,968
It's a rental.

190
00:08:07,036 --> 00:08:08,670
My car's in the shop.
don't ask.

191
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,006
Okay, i won't.

192
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,575
I appreciate you driving out
to the middle of nowhere.

193
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:15,277
I'm kind of dealing with
a head-scratcher here,

194
00:08:15,344 --> 00:08:18,647
And i suddenly thought that
this might be up your alley.

195
00:08:18,714 --> 00:08:22,284
A big telecommunications company
has cell phone towers out here.

196
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:23,752
And the guy in charge
of maintaining them

197
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:26,688
Was driving along the
access road this morning

198
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,857
When he noticed this.

199
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,926
Somebody set off

200
00:08:30,993 --> 00:08:33,094
Some kind of explosive
device here last night.

201
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:35,530
The question is, what for?

202
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,266
Was it just a prank or could
it have been a dress rehearsal

203
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:39,668
For something to come?

204
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:41,937
I was out here all morning
with the forensics boys

205
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:43,905
And all we found were a
bunch of tiny shards.

206
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:46,341
Some metal,
some plastic.

207
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:47,809
I was hoping you could
help me figure out

208
00:08:47,877 --> 00:08:49,811
Whether this was just someone
getting their jollies on

209
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,513
Or if it's actually something
we should be concerned about.

210
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,014
(police radio buzzes on)

211
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:54,916
Man (over radio):
hq to detective scanlon.
what's your 20?

212
00:08:54,984 --> 00:08:56,518
They always call when
you're nowhere near the car.

213
00:08:56,585 --> 00:08:58,219
(laughs)

214
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:10,198
<i>man:

215
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:14,436
Three, four, five, six,

00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:17,072
Seven, eight, nine,

217
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:21,309
Ten, 11, 12, 13, 14,

220
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:35,757
Twenty-two.

221
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,478
(beeping)

222
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:58,346
(beeping slowly)

223
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:02,851
(beeping rapidly)

224
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:05,020
(explosion echoes)

225
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,192
Scanlon:
you all right?

226
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,895
Yeah, i'm fine.

227
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:16,831
Well, i think i can tell you
what happened here.

228
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:21,102
I can't really explain it,
but i can describe it.

229
00:10:22,271 --> 00:10:23,438
(ringing)

230
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:24,773
Uh...

231
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,576
Hello?

232
00:10:28,644 --> 00:10:29,844
Joe:
i was just calling to see

233
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:31,446
How things went
at the rental place.

234
00:10:31,514 --> 00:10:33,048
Well, it went fine.

235
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:35,016
Uh, i ended up with something
a little fancier

236
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:37,819
Than i'd normally go for,
but it was all they had.

237
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,454
This is kind of cool, though.

238
00:10:39,522 --> 00:10:41,656
I'm talking to you
through the car speakers.

239
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,158
That's actually
called bluetooth, al.

240
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,559
It's been around for years.

241
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:46,361
Listen, um,

242
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:47,796
I don't want to freak you out,

243
00:10:47,863 --> 00:10:49,264
But the buttons
on the car door--

244
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:51,032
They make the windows
go up and down.

245
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,434
You're very funny.

246
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:54,102
You're very comical.

247
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,905
Actually, there's all kinds
of gizmos in here,

248
00:10:56,972 --> 00:10:59,174
And i'm going to have
to figure them out for myself.

249
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,975
Okay. i'll call you later?

250
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:02,310
Call you later.

251
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:04,045
(beep)

252
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:08,049
Woman (over radio):
this is satellite traffic
for boston.

253
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:09,551
We're looking
at bumper-to-bumper traf...

254
00:11:09,618 --> 00:11:12,320
Man:
you're listening
to satellite traffic for denver.

255
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:13,621
Major...

in portuguese)

257
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:19,727

258
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:24,632
(turns up volume)

259
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:35,777
Man (over radio):
are you sure?

260
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:36,911
I mean, really sure?

261
00:11:36,979 --> 00:11:38,379
Like, we can call
my parents, sure?

262
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,149
Woman:
i can't be positive,
but i took four

263
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:43,618
Of those take-home tests,
and they all were.

264
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:45,753
(couple laughing excitedly)

265
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,456
Man:
we're having a baby?

266
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:50,258
We're having a baby.

267
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:51,326

268
00:11:51,393 --> 00:11:52,360

Man (over radio):

276
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:31,466
Man 2:
you need to stop crying.
people can see.

277
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:33,902
You need to pull
yourself together.

278
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:35,637
The light's green. go.

279
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:37,572

280
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:42,143
I'm sorry.
i think it's the gun.

281
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:43,344
Uh...

282
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:45,346
Seeing it-it... it make...

283
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:46,648
It's making me shake.

284
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:49,984
I... i can barely hold
the steering wheel.

285
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,459
Look, if it's the car,
i'll give it to you.

286
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,727
(man panting)

287
00:12:59,795 --> 00:13:01,196
I'll... i'll just get out,

288
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:05,066
And you can get behind the wheel
and drive away.

289
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:06,668
(man groaning)

290
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:09,637
(man whimpering)

291
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,639
That gun in my... my side...

292
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,641
Just please don't kill me.

293
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:14,709
Just don't...

294
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:17,212
My god, don't kill me, okay?

295
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,347
I beg... don't...

297
00:13:26,683 --> 00:13:29,051
woman (over radio):
meanwhile, in washington
earlier today,

298
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:30,186
Congressional leaders...

299
00:13:30,254 --> 00:13:32,054
Man:
and, over on the hardwood...

300
00:13:32,122 --> 00:13:36,192
I'm telling you, i heard
someone being kidnapped.

301
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,960
It wasn't doing
that this morning.

302
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:40,029
This morning, i could hear
other people's conversations.

303
00:13:40,097 --> 00:13:42,098
I could see them
talking in their car,

304
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,033
And i could hear
them in here.

305
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:46,102
(sighs)
well, it's not doing it now.

306
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,904
Well, i know it's
not doing it now.

307
00:13:47,971 --> 00:13:49,772
Um, i don't know
what to tell you, al.

308
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,840
Maybe the
satellite radio

309
00:13:50,908 --> 00:13:52,408
Was picking up
cell phone signals.

310
00:13:52,476 --> 00:13:54,310
They weren't talking
on their cell phones.

311
00:13:54,378 --> 00:13:56,579
They were talking to each
other-- i could see them.

312
00:13:56,647 --> 00:13:58,114
Well, you called
detective scanlon,

313
00:13:58,182 --> 00:13:59,849
And you described
the vehicle, right?

314
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:01,184
A blue pickup.

315
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:03,519
Well, i think it's out
of your hands, then.

316
00:14:03,587 --> 00:14:05,922
I think you've done
all that you can.

317
00:14:05,989 --> 00:14:08,357
I got to head inside, al.

318
00:14:09,393 --> 00:14:12,028
You know, i promised
that woman whose, uh,

319
00:14:12,095 --> 00:14:13,896
Daughter ran into your car
that i'd call her

320
00:14:13,964 --> 00:14:15,765
The moment that we heard
from her insurance company.

321
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,200
Um, you're welcome
to come with me.

322
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:19,669
Or, if you'd rather just listen
to what we have to say,

323
00:14:19,736 --> 00:14:21,604
You could always just
turn on your car radio.

324
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,607

But i need you to do

Look, i had a dream last night
about a... a bank robbery.

352
00:15:18,228 --> 00:15:20,796
Well, then, you just may
be batting two for two.

353
00:15:20,864 --> 00:15:22,598
What are you talking about?

354
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,301
I'm standing outside the main
branch of mariposa national.

355
00:15:25,369 --> 00:15:27,069
Some guy walked in here
45 minutes ago

356
00:15:27,137 --> 00:15:28,437
And tried to rob the place.

357
00:15:28,505 --> 00:15:29,805
Teller hit the silent alarm.

358
00:15:29,873 --> 00:15:32,074
We think he's got 18 hostages
in there, and of course,

359
00:15:32,142 --> 00:15:33,809
We've got every cop
in phoenix out here.

360
00:15:33,877 --> 00:15:35,778
But here's the part
i thought you'd like.

361
00:15:35,846 --> 00:15:38,648
Turns out our bank robber showed
up in a blue pickup truck.

362
00:15:38,715 --> 00:15:40,449
Lee, he's got a bomb.

363
00:15:40,517 --> 00:15:41,684
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
say that again.

364
00:15:41,752 --> 00:15:42,752
A bomb.

365
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:43,920
He's wearing a bomb.

366
00:15:43,987 --> 00:15:45,788
You have to get everyone out
of that bank.

367
00:15:45,856 --> 00:15:48,057
You've got to get someone
from the bomb squad over there.

368
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,092
Okay, i'm on it.

369
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,595
(siren wailing,
helicopter blades whirring)

370
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:53,829
Lieutenant wilkes,
this is that woman

371
00:15:53,897 --> 00:15:54,864
I was telling you about.

372
00:15:54,932 --> 00:15:56,666
Allison, this is
patrick wilkes,

373
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:58,200
The best bomb man
in the southwest.

374
00:15:58,268 --> 00:15:59,402
So, you've seen it?

375
00:15:59,469 --> 00:16:00,670
The bomb?

376
00:16:00,737 --> 00:16:02,271
I think so. yeah.

377
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:05,041
It... it was strapped to
his body, kind of like a vest.

378
00:16:05,108 --> 00:16:07,443
And it had, uh,
all those padlocks on it.

379
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:09,245
You see any wires?

380
00:16:09,313 --> 00:16:10,980
Wires?
lots of wires.

381
00:16:11,048 --> 00:16:13,983
And, uh, there were bricks--
like clay.

382
00:16:14,051 --> 00:16:16,919
And for what it's worth,
he seemed genuinely scared.

383
00:16:16,987 --> 00:16:19,722
Almost as if he...
he didn't want to be there.

384
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,558
Almost as if,
uh, it wasn't his idea.

385
00:16:24,027 --> 00:16:26,095
What?

386
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:27,630
The bank robber's been
on the phone

387
00:16:27,698 --> 00:16:28,998
With the hostage
negotiator.

388
00:16:29,066 --> 00:16:31,067
He claims someone forced him
to do what he's doing.

389
00:16:31,134 --> 00:16:33,536
Says a guy in a ski mask
climbed into his truck yesterday

390
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:34,804
And held him at gunpoint.

391
00:16:34,871 --> 00:16:36,806
Made him drive to some kind
of trailer workshop,

392
00:16:36,873 --> 00:16:38,574
Where he and another man
locked this bomb--

393
00:16:38,642 --> 00:16:40,042
Which i guess is this vest thing

394
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,644
You're talking about--
onto his body.

395
00:16:41,712 --> 00:16:43,179
Well, i think
he's telling the truth.

396
00:16:43,246 --> 00:16:44,580
And that explosion
in the desert--

397
00:16:44,648 --> 00:16:46,048
I think it's all part of this.

398
00:16:46,116 --> 00:16:47,950
It must have been a test.

399
00:16:48,018 --> 00:16:50,386
Whoever strapped that bomb
to that poor man...

400
00:16:50,454 --> 00:16:51,787
He must have
been practicing.

401
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:53,556
Apparently,
it's a remote control rig.

402
00:16:54,658 --> 00:16:56,058
He's telling
the hostage negotiators,

403
00:16:56,126 --> 00:16:58,227
If we don't let him walk out
of there,

404
00:16:58,295 --> 00:17:00,830
If he hasn't delivered the money
to the guy who abducted him

405
00:17:00,897 --> 00:17:02,365
Within the next half hour,

406
00:17:02,432 --> 00:17:04,500
The whole place
is going to blow.

407
00:17:04,568 --> 00:17:05,735
You have to
let him go.

408
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:07,036
All-all those
people in there.

409
00:17:07,104 --> 00:17:10,006
Actually, he's letting them out.

410
00:17:10,073 --> 00:17:11,641
The hostage negotiator
convinced him that patrick here

411
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:12,908
Could defuse
that rig he's wearing,

412
00:17:12,976 --> 00:17:15,177
But that we had to get
all the people out first.

413
00:17:15,245 --> 00:17:16,846
Is that true?
can you do that?

414
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:18,581
Been doing it 15 years.

415
00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:20,016
But the truth is,

416
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,284
I won't know until i get a look
at the thing.

417
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:23,486
I'm sorry.
i wish...

418
00:17:23,553 --> 00:17:24,954
I wish i could
tell you more.

419
00:17:25,022 --> 00:17:26,188
No, it all helps.

420
00:17:26,256 --> 00:17:27,823
Really.

421
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:32,528
The, uh, detective here tells me
that you're a wife and a mother.

422
00:17:32,596 --> 00:17:34,063
(sighs)

423
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:35,698
Do me a favor, then.

424
00:17:35,766 --> 00:17:37,233
Get out of here.

425
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,069
As far as you can,
as fast as you can.

426
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:43,105
(school bell ringing)

427
00:17:43,173 --> 00:17:45,241
Ariel:
looks like it hurts.

428
00:17:45,308 --> 00:17:47,009
Oh. hey.

429
00:17:47,077 --> 00:17:48,544
Uh, yeah, that seat belt

430
00:17:48,612 --> 00:17:50,813
Really dug into
me yesterday.

431
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:54,316
Thought this shirt covered
it up more, but...

432
00:17:55,185 --> 00:17:56,752
Um, i'm jamie.

433
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,287
Ariel.

434
00:17:58,355 --> 00:18:00,856
I'm... i'm sorry
about yesterday.

435
00:18:00,924 --> 00:18:02,591
I... it's really
embarrassing

436
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:03,959
And upsetting

437
00:18:04,027 --> 00:18:05,561
And...
you know,
at this point, it's...

438
00:18:05,629 --> 00:18:07,129
It's just an inconvenience.

439
00:18:07,197 --> 00:18:10,332
Yeah, but, i mean, your
parents were so nice.

440
00:18:12,102 --> 00:18:14,603
Do you  want to, you know,
borrow this?

441
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:16,205
To cover the, uh...
oh.

442
00:18:16,273 --> 00:18:17,807
Sure. thank you.
yeah.

443
00:18:17,874 --> 00:18:20,109
(chuckles)

444
00:18:21,645 --> 00:18:23,779
Oh, no, no.

445
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:26,048
What did i
just do?

446
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:29,085
Jamie, are you
all right?

447
00:18:29,152 --> 00:18:31,220
Yeah. yeah, i'm all right.

448
00:18:31,288 --> 00:18:33,189
I'm a little sore,
but i'm all right.

449
00:18:33,256 --> 00:18:35,458
Listen to me. we've got
to get out of the car

450
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:37,226
Right now before
anyone gets here.

451
00:18:37,294 --> 00:18:39,628
And when people do get here,
you've got to tell them

452
00:18:39,696 --> 00:18:41,263
That you were driving.
you understand?

453
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:42,531
What? no. why?

454
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,533
Sweetie, my record's
not perfect.

455
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:46,836
If the police find out
that i was driving,

456
00:18:46,903 --> 00:18:48,537
They'd... they'll
give me tests.

457
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,008
Oh, i love you, baby.

458
00:18:55,412 --> 00:18:57,747
Um...

459
00:18:57,814 --> 00:19:00,683
Can i ask you a question?

460
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:02,551
If you were driving
yesterday morning,

461
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:04,553
Then how come
your seat belt bruises

462
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:07,156
Are on your right shoulder?

463
00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:10,326
I mean, if you were driving,
they would be on your left.

464
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:17,500
You weren't driving,
were you?

465
00:19:18,935 --> 00:19:21,737
Look, we already said the
accident was our fault,

466
00:19:21,805 --> 00:19:23,606
So what does it matter
who was driving?

467
00:19:23,673 --> 00:19:25,541
The insurance is
going to pay for it.

468
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:26,976
(school bell ringing)

469
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:29,178
I... i guess
we got to go.

470
00:19:29,246 --> 00:19:30,412
(sighs)

471
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,281
Thanks for the scarf.

472
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,784
Yeah.

473
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:36,652
<i>male newscaster:
once again, we're told
the bomb squad</i>

474
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,321
Is on the scene
at the mariposa national bank.

475
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:40,956
And that an expert of some kind

476
00:19:41,024 --> 00:19:43,025
Has been in the bank
for ten minutes now,

477
00:19:43,093 --> 00:19:45,261
But beyond that, officials
are being tight-lipped.

478
00:19:45,328 --> 00:19:48,030
We can tell you,
if you're driving in that area,

479
00:19:48,098 --> 00:19:50,332
Traffic is at
a virtual standstill.

480
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,769
In sports, the national
hockey league featured a...

481
00:19:53,837 --> 00:19:56,071
Man (over radio):
oh, god, god, god, god.

482
00:19:56,139 --> 00:19:58,908
Wilkes:
i need you to
stop doing that.

483
00:19:58,975 --> 00:20:00,743
And i need you to
stop shaking.

484
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:02,978
Okay.
(horn honking)

485
00:20:03,046 --> 00:20:05,281
I think i've got this
wiring system clocked.

486
00:20:05,348 --> 00:20:06,582
Okay.

487
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,950
(beeping)

488
00:20:08,018 --> 00:20:09,885
Wait, what is that?
why is it doing that?

489
00:20:09,953 --> 00:20:12,154
It's just acting up 'cause
i'm monkeying with it.

490
00:20:12,222 --> 00:20:14,023
Doesn't mean it's
going to explode.

491
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,491
How do you know that?

492
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,159
You-you can't
be sure.

493
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:19,395
Yeah, actually, i can.

494
00:20:19,462 --> 00:20:22,398
I've disarmed systems
a lot more complicated

495
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:23,866
Than this one.

496
00:20:23,934 --> 00:20:26,101
Timer's still got about
ten minutes left on it.

497
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:29,004
Trust me-- it's not
even going to be close.

498
00:20:30,607 --> 00:20:32,041
Now, listen.

499
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:33,742
This wire i'm looking
at right here?
yeah.

500
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,910
The yellow one?
mm-hmm.

501
00:20:34,978 --> 00:20:38,514
I'm going to
cut it now.

502
00:20:38,582 --> 00:20:41,817
Iafter i cut it,
we'll be in the clear.

503
00:20:41,885 --> 00:20:43,285
You ready?

504
00:20:43,353 --> 00:20:45,354
Just do it.

505
00:20:45,422 --> 00:20:48,123
Okay.

506
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:49,358
Here we go.

507
00:20:49,426 --> 00:20:50,659
(snipping)

508
00:20:51,695 --> 00:20:53,996
Is that it?

509
00:20:54,064 --> 00:20:56,232
Did... did it work?

510
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:58,400
Can you... can you get
this thing off me now?

511
00:20:58,468 --> 00:21:00,569
Cut these locks off.

512
00:21:00,637 --> 00:21:03,472
(rapid beeping)

513
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,940
Wait a second.

514
00:21:05,008 --> 00:21:06,976
What is that?
is that... wait.

515
00:21:07,043 --> 00:21:09,245
Hey. is it supposed
to be doing that?

516
00:21:09,312 --> 00:21:11,313
(booming)

517
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:20,084
All right.

518
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,888
Lieutenant wilkes
is going to be okay.

519
00:21:23,955 --> 00:21:25,756
Apparently, there was
some sort of delay

520
00:21:25,824 --> 00:21:27,291
After the bomb
armed itself.

521
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:29,460
He had a couple of seconds
to run for cover.

522
00:21:29,528 --> 00:21:31,795
The fire department found
him pinned under a desk.

523
00:21:31,863 --> 00:21:33,464
That desk took the brunt
of the explosion.

524
00:21:33,532 --> 00:21:35,132
Headgear and body armor
handled the rest.

525
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,800
What about the bank robber?

526
00:21:36,868 --> 00:21:38,469
The man wearing the vest?

527
00:21:38,537 --> 00:21:39,703
Yeah, not so lucky.

528
00:21:39,771 --> 00:21:42,373
Crime scene boys found
a piece of a jawbone

529
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,974
And the tip of an
index finger.

530
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:45,309
That's it.

531
00:21:45,377 --> 00:21:46,644
Everything else was
obliterated--

532
00:21:46,711 --> 00:21:48,512
Including all the money
he was trying to steal.

533
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,947
Well, that's the thing.
i don't think he was

534
00:21:50,015 --> 00:21:51,015
Trying to steal any money.

535
00:21:51,082 --> 00:21:52,449
I think he was a victim
in all of this.

536
00:21:52,517 --> 00:21:54,218
I think somebody forced him
to go into that bank.

537
00:21:54,286 --> 00:21:56,220
Lee told me about
the thing you heard

538
00:21:56,288 --> 00:21:58,722
Or overheard in your car?

539
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,058
Well, i can't, uh,

540
00:22:01,126 --> 00:22:03,561
Shed much light on any of that,
but i can tell you this,

541
00:22:03,628 --> 00:22:05,062
The man who tried
to rob that bank?

542
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,463
He's no stranger to robbery

543
00:22:06,531 --> 00:22:09,066
And he's no stranger to banks.

544
00:22:09,134 --> 00:22:10,467
Name's troy sanborn.

545
00:22:10,535 --> 00:22:12,102
Did five years

546
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,138
Back in the late '90s
for walking into a bank

547
00:22:14,205 --> 00:22:17,107
In denver with a hand grenade.

548
00:22:17,175 --> 00:22:18,943
Wait a second.
if it was his bomb,

549
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,645
Why would he let the bomb squad
in to take look at it?

550
00:22:21,713 --> 00:22:23,981
Why would he let anyone
take a look at it?

551
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:25,649
And why would
he let it go off?

552
00:22:25,717 --> 00:22:27,418
They think he made it up.
the whole story.

553
00:22:27,485 --> 00:22:29,053
They think he strapped
that bomb to himself

554
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,188
So that after he dumped
the cash that he stole,

555
00:22:31,256 --> 00:22:33,490
He could claim he was
the victim all along.

556
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:35,159
But let's say
you're right.

557
00:22:35,226 --> 00:22:38,329
Let's say there really is a
second man out there somewhere.

558
00:22:38,396 --> 00:22:39,997
The only thing we know about him

559
00:22:40,065 --> 00:22:41,632
Is that he was wearing
a ski mask

560
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,301
When this supposed abduction
took place.

561
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:47,304
The one person who could tell us
anything more than that--

562
00:22:47,372 --> 00:22:49,306
Troy sanborn-- is dead.

563
00:22:49,374 --> 00:22:52,543
Now, i know the crime
scene unit recovered

564
00:22:52,611 --> 00:22:54,545
Some small pieces
of the bomb's casing.

565
00:22:54,613 --> 00:22:56,347
Maybe, if we're lucky,
that'll lead us somewhere.

566
00:22:56,414 --> 00:22:57,848
But if it doesn't?

567
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,850
If this mastermind

568
00:22:59,918 --> 00:23:02,319
You believe you heard the other
day really does exist?

569
00:23:02,387 --> 00:23:05,322
Well, he's going to be awfully
hard to track down.

570
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,557
<i>no, that's</i>

571
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:09,059
Very thoughtful of you
to call, mrs. portman.

572
00:23:09,127 --> 00:23:11,061
Uh, but, no, honestly,

573
00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:12,563
Everything has gone
really well

574
00:23:12,631 --> 00:23:14,565
With your insurance
company so far.

575
00:23:14,633 --> 00:23:16,567
And, uh, the truth is,
we still haven't gotten

576
00:23:16,635 --> 00:23:19,637
An estimate back from the,
uh, from the body shop.

577
00:23:21,272 --> 00:23:23,040
Uh-huh.

578
00:23:23,108 --> 00:23:26,043
Oh, that is a very,
very generous offer,

579
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:27,544
But i'm-i'm sure that we...

580
00:23:27,612 --> 00:23:29,546
We don't need to take you up
on that.

581
00:23:29,614 --> 00:23:31,548
Okay.

582
00:23:31,616 --> 00:23:33,050
Yeah.

583
00:23:33,118 --> 00:23:34,885
You have a nice night, too, now.

584
00:23:34,953 --> 00:23:36,887
Bye-bye.

585
00:23:36,955 --> 00:23:38,722
It's, uh, lauren portman,

586
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,891
The, uh, saint lauren portman.

587
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:42,393
Um, she sends you her regards.

588
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,462
And she wants to thank you
again for your patience.

589
00:23:46,498 --> 00:23:48,265
Well, if someone had
to hit my car,

590
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,100
I guess i'm glad
she's the one who did it.

591
00:23:50,168 --> 00:23:51,602
I know, we should try
to schedule all

592
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,237
Of our future
wrecks with her.

593
00:23:53,304 --> 00:23:55,305
She even offered to
drive ariel to school.

594
00:23:56,341 --> 00:23:58,275
Who offered to drive
me to school?

595
00:23:58,343 --> 00:23:59,777
Uh, jamie's mom.

596
00:23:59,844 --> 00:24:03,013
She, uh... that was her
on the phone just now.

597
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:06,050
Yeah, well, i'm not getting
in a car with that woman.

598
00:24:06,117 --> 00:24:07,584
Well, you don't have to.

599
00:24:07,652 --> 00:24:10,087
It's just nice to know that,
you know, we have the option.

600
00:24:10,155 --> 00:24:13,157
Okay, but that's not
an option for me.

601
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:16,226
(music playing)

602
00:24:16,294 --> 00:24:18,295
(phone ringing)
(man humming along with music)

603
00:24:24,536 --> 00:24:26,470
Man's voice:
leave a message.

604
00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:27,838
Automated voice:
hello.

605
00:24:27,906 --> 00:24:31,108
This is a message
for jesse reeder

606
00:24:31,176 --> 00:24:33,143
Concerning the collection
of an unpaid debt.

607
00:24:33,211 --> 00:24:36,647
If you are not jesse reeder,

608
00:24:36,715 --> 00:24:39,883
Please contact
the ulterion credit agency

609
00:24:39,951 --> 00:24:41,885
And calls to this number
will cease.

610
00:24:41,953 --> 00:24:43,954
Thank you.
(machine beeps)

611
00:24:44,956 --> 00:24:46,957
(man humming)

612
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,607
Jesse reeder.

613
00:25:03,675 --> 00:25:05,676
Jesse reeder.

614
00:25:08,012 --> 00:25:10,314
(school bell ringing)
ashley:
check it out.

615
00:25:10,381 --> 00:25:11,648
My article on the football team

616
00:25:11,716 --> 00:25:13,283
Made the front page
of the school paper.

617
00:25:13,351 --> 00:25:14,618
No way.
way way.

618
00:25:14,686 --> 00:25:15,853
Mr. benevento said

619
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,488
I'm the first junior to do it
in seven years.

620
00:25:17,555 --> 00:25:20,190
In particular
interest to you

621
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:22,793
Will be the fifth paragraph
in the second column,

622
00:25:22,861 --> 00:25:24,828
Where i write about my good
friend ariel dubois

623
00:25:24,896 --> 00:25:27,030
Totally wanting junior
sensation chad colburn.

624
00:25:27,098 --> 00:25:29,099
Oh.
(laughs)

625
00:25:39,277 --> 00:25:42,346
Uh, you know,
i was just kidding

626
00:25:42,413 --> 00:25:43,747
About that last
part, right?

627
00:25:43,815 --> 00:25:45,215
Huh?

628
00:25:45,283 --> 00:25:47,518
I didn't actually write about
you wanting chad colburn.

629
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:04,501
Joe:
but why do you care?

630
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:06,870
What kind of question is that?

631
00:26:06,938 --> 00:26:08,872
Oh, i don't know.
i'm just fascinated.

632
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,707
I mean, after all these years

633
00:26:10,775 --> 00:26:12,876
I'm still trying to figure out
how your mind works.

634
00:26:12,944 --> 00:26:16,380
I mean, this guy, he gets blown
up trying to rob a bank.

635
00:26:16,447 --> 00:26:18,048
The guy who made his
living robbing banks.

636
00:26:18,116 --> 00:26:21,218
The guy who once walked into
a bank full of people
with a hand grenade.

637
00:26:21,286 --> 00:26:22,386
Me?

638
00:26:22,453 --> 00:26:24,388
I-i kinda figure
good riddance.

639
00:26:24,455 --> 00:26:26,390
But you-- you're
all worked up

640
00:26:26,457 --> 00:26:29,193
That maybe somehow this
guy's a victim in all this.

641
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,196
Well, maybe it has
nothing to do with him.

642
00:26:32,263 --> 00:26:35,699
I mean, it's more like...

643
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:38,702
It's like a thank you note
that you didn't write.

644
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,537
You wake up every morning
and you think,

645
00:26:40,605 --> 00:26:42,539
"oh, gotta that note."

646
00:26:42,607 --> 00:26:43,974
And you never get around to it.

647
00:26:44,042 --> 00:26:45,809
And then one day
you finally do it.

648
00:26:45,877 --> 00:26:47,077
You write it.

649
00:26:47,145 --> 00:26:48,278
And then you feel better.

650
00:26:48,346 --> 00:26:51,281
You feel... in balance.

651
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:53,784
I just know that this guy

652
00:26:53,852 --> 00:26:56,520
Did not walk into that bank
of his own free will.

653
00:26:56,588 --> 00:26:58,589
And until everybody else
knows it...

654
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:03,560
And you call that
thing a gift.

655
00:27:03,628 --> 00:27:05,629
(groans)

656
00:27:07,932 --> 00:27:10,367
(sighs)

657
00:27:10,435 --> 00:27:12,436
(phone ringing)

658
00:27:14,873 --> 00:27:16,373
Hello-hello?

659
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:18,375
Scanlon:
you were right and i was wrong.

660
00:27:18,443 --> 00:27:20,410
You were right
and we were all wrong.

661
00:27:20,478 --> 00:27:22,079
Really? what i was right about?

662
00:27:22,146 --> 00:27:24,081
Well, jesse reeder, for one.

663
00:27:24,148 --> 00:27:26,083
We found him.

664
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,918
We found that trailer
you dreamed about, too.

665
00:27:27,986 --> 00:27:29,386
It's like bombs"r"us in here.

666
00:27:29,454 --> 00:27:33,090
Wires, detonators,
blasting caps, you name it.

667
00:27:33,157 --> 00:27:35,659
Even a mannequin rigged up
with one of his bomb vests.

668
00:27:35,727 --> 00:27:39,329
Which makes me think maybe you
were right about troy sanborn.

669
00:27:39,397 --> 00:27:40,664
Maybe he was a patsy.

670
00:27:40,732 --> 00:27:43,667
Maybe reeder was the one
pulling the strings.

671
00:27:43,735 --> 00:27:45,669
Really? did reeder confess?

672
00:27:45,737 --> 00:27:49,006
No, but then he's not
in much of a position to.

673
00:27:49,073 --> 00:27:51,508
Looks like he was gearing up
to rob another bank,

674
00:27:51,576 --> 00:27:53,844
When something went off
in his face.

675
00:27:53,912 --> 00:27:56,914
Truth is, there's just not
a whole lot left of him.

676
00:27:57,982 --> 00:27:59,249
The way it stands,

677
00:27:59,317 --> 00:28:00,951
Forensics is going to have
to scrape bits and pieces

678
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:02,352
Off the walls and ceiling

679
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:05,522
So we can make a dna match
and issue a death certificate.

680
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,191
Well, thanks for that visual.

681
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:10,027
I'm going to go back
to sleep now.

682
00:28:10,094 --> 00:28:11,528
Well, i'm going to try, anyway.

683
00:28:11,596 --> 00:28:13,597
Nighty-night.

684
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:16,934
There you go.

685
00:28:17,001 --> 00:28:19,770
All your thank you
notes are done.

686
00:28:19,837 --> 00:28:21,371
You feel better?

687
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:24,641
I don't know.
ask me in the morning.

688
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:26,643
(metallic rattling, siren wails)

689
00:28:26,711 --> 00:28:28,712
(helicopter blades whirring)

690
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:37,654
(distant siren wailing)

691
00:28:37,722 --> 00:28:39,723
(metallic rattling)

692
00:28:42,026 --> 00:28:44,528
I'm going to die.

693
00:28:44,595 --> 00:28:47,597
We're both going to die,
mr. sanborn.

694
00:28:49,067 --> 00:28:51,001
Just not today.

695
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:53,070
(metallic rattling)

696
00:28:55,406 --> 00:28:58,141
Mind if i ask why you're holding
those keys there?

697
00:28:58,209 --> 00:29:01,311
Um, they open
the safe deposit boxes.

698
00:29:01,379 --> 00:29:04,314
The man who put this vest on me

699
00:29:04,382 --> 00:29:06,483
Told me to get them
from the bank manager.

700
00:29:06,551 --> 00:29:08,151
He was very specific.

701
00:29:08,219 --> 00:29:11,121
What do you say you let me hold
them for a little while?

702
00:29:11,189 --> 00:29:13,156
That rattling's
kind of distracting.

703
00:29:13,224 --> 00:29:15,759
Okay.

704
00:29:15,827 --> 00:29:17,260
There you go.

705
00:29:17,328 --> 00:29:19,329
There you go.

706
00:29:21,766 --> 00:29:23,700
Okay.

707
00:29:23,768 --> 00:29:25,736
We're about ready to get
down to business here.

708
00:29:25,803 --> 00:29:27,504
I'm going to make a quick sweep,

709
00:29:27,572 --> 00:29:29,539
Make sure nobody's here,
and then we'll get started.

710
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:30,774
Okay?

711
00:29:30,842 --> 00:29:32,776
No, you're leaving me?

712
00:29:32,844 --> 00:29:34,978
Just for a second,
i promise.

713
00:29:35,046 --> 00:29:37,014
Now, you stand here
and try not to move,

714
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:38,682
And then i'll be right back.

715
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,317
Okay? in a jiffy.

716
00:29:40,385 --> 00:29:41,585
Okay?

717
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,059
Nice and easy, troy.

718
00:29:49,127 --> 00:29:51,128
Stay perfectly still.

719
00:30:20,158 --> 00:30:23,160
(helicopter blades whirring,
siren wailing)

720
00:30:46,517 --> 00:30:50,120
Okay, we're ready
to get started.

721
00:30:50,188 --> 00:30:53,123
Try to stay calm,
mr. sanborn.

722
00:30:53,191 --> 00:30:56,693
I think i've got this wiring
system all figured out.

723
00:30:56,761 --> 00:30:58,895
(gasps)

724
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:02,794
I'm sorry, allison,
but you're telling me

725
00:31:03,097 --> 00:31:04,364
That you think patrick wilkes,

726
00:31:04,431 --> 00:31:05,965
The man who almost
got himself killed

727
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:07,967
Trying to defuse that bomb,
is the same man

728
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:10,003
Who strapped it on
to troy sanborn?

729
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,237
Not only that.
i'm telling you

730
00:31:11,305 --> 00:31:13,773
He managed to steal
a little over $400,000

731
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:15,675
While he was at it.
that doesn't sense.

732
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:17,343
The bomb almost
killed wilkes.
no, it didn't.

733
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:19,345
After he triggered
the detonating device--

734
00:31:19,413 --> 00:31:21,748
And make no mistake, he is
the one who triggered it--

735
00:31:22,015 --> 00:31:24,150
He had a few seconds
to jump behind that desk.

736
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,119
And he knew
he would have those few seconds

737
00:31:26,186 --> 00:31:27,954
'cause he's the one
who rigged that bomb.

738
00:31:28,021 --> 00:31:29,756
I mean, think
about it.

739
00:31:29,823 --> 00:31:31,557
How much sense does it make

740
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:32,959
To strap a bomb onto somebody

741
00:31:33,026 --> 00:31:35,027
And ask them
to rob a bank for you?

742
00:31:35,095 --> 00:31:37,697
I mean, how can you be sure
that the police aren't going

743
00:31:37,765 --> 00:31:39,365
To follow him back
to where you're hiding?

744
00:31:39,433 --> 00:31:40,633
Wouldn't you be better off

745
00:31:40,701 --> 00:31:42,568
Figuring a way
to get into the bank yourself,

746
00:31:42,636 --> 00:31:45,138
So you could hide the money
where no one would find it?

747
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:48,174
Patrick wilkes
knew that

748
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:50,476
He was gonna be called in
to defuse that bomb,

749
00:31:50,544 --> 00:31:52,812
Just like he knew the police
were gonna cut the power

750
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,114
To that bank while they were
negotiating with troy sanborn.

751
00:31:55,182 --> 00:31:56,449
He was counting on it.

752
00:31:56,517 --> 00:31:58,117
With all
of the security cameras down,

753
00:31:58,185 --> 00:31:59,519
He'd have
plenty of time

754
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:01,320
To-to stash the money
that he'd forced

755
00:32:01,388 --> 00:32:03,289
Sanborn to steal,
and after that,

756
00:32:03,357 --> 00:32:04,991
The bomb took care of the rest.

757
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:07,760
The one witness that he had
to the crime was dead,

758
00:32:07,828 --> 00:32:09,095
And the money

759
00:32:09,163 --> 00:32:11,197
That he took would be presumed
lost in the explosion.

760
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:13,332
No one would even bother
trying to look for it.

761
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,500
Allison,

762
00:32:14,568 --> 00:32:17,136
We found a bomb
vest identical

763
00:32:17,204 --> 00:32:19,071
To the one that
killed troy sanborn

764
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:20,673
In jesse reeder's home.

765
00:32:20,741 --> 00:32:23,342
Jesse reeder's the
guy you told us to
go find, remember?

766
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,711
So, reeder built
and tested a bomb for wilkes.

767
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:28,347
And wilkes didn't need reeder
anymore. boom.

768
00:32:28,415 --> 00:32:31,484
I bet you wilkes is
counting on the fact

769
00:32:31,552 --> 00:32:33,719
That finding reeder's body
closes the case.

770
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:37,723
I don't know what to tell you,
allison.

771
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:40,960
Most people in this city think
that patrick wilkes is a hero.

772
00:32:41,028 --> 00:32:42,528
They're even giving him a medal

773
00:32:42,596 --> 00:32:43,930
This afternoon.

774
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:45,998
I can prove what wilkes did.

775
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:49,402
What's this?
serial numbers

776
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,237
On the deposit boxes
that wilkes used.

777
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:52,472
Open them up.

778
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:54,807
You'll find the money.

779
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:57,210
(school bell ringing)

780
00:32:57,277 --> 00:32:59,879
Here's the thing.

781
00:32:59,947 --> 00:33:02,315
You can't get in the car
with your mom again.

782
00:33:02,382 --> 00:33:03,583
Not when she's driving.

783
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,485
Excuse me?

784
00:33:05,552 --> 00:33:07,653
Look, i know
that you love her,

785
00:33:07,721 --> 00:33:10,289
And i know that it's really hard
to wrap your brain around it,

786
00:33:10,357 --> 00:33:13,326
But she's going to get you
killed if you let her,

787
00:33:13,393 --> 00:33:14,894
So you can't let her.

788
00:33:17,464 --> 00:33:19,398
I'm not guessing

789
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:21,000
About something
that might happen.

790
00:33:21,068 --> 00:33:23,002
I am telling you about something

791
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,137
That is going to happen.

792
00:33:26,807 --> 00:33:29,575
This is the thing
that people talk about

793
00:33:29,643 --> 00:33:31,577
About you and your
mom, isn't it?

794
00:33:31,645 --> 00:33:34,280
Yeah.

795
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:36,115
Well, you don't know
what you're saying.

796
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:38,150
I mean, you don't
know my mom.

797
00:33:38,218 --> 00:33:39,752
She's a great mom.

798
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,188
She is a great mom,

799
00:33:42,256 --> 00:33:45,124
But she's got a problem.

800
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,564
So, how do i get to school?

801
00:33:51,632 --> 00:33:54,200
We'll walk.

802
00:33:54,268 --> 00:33:56,802
I'll walk with you.

803
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:00,473
And after school, you can
practice driving with me

804
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:03,576
So that we can get you
your license,

805
00:34:03,644 --> 00:34:06,078
So that you can drive,
really drive,

806
00:34:06,146 --> 00:34:09,081
And not just take the blame
when she does.

807
00:34:11,118 --> 00:34:13,052
So call her

808
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,922
And tell her that she doesn't
have to pick you up

809
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:18,090
Because you're gonna walk home
with a friend.

810
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:29,335
<i>allison:
what do you mean,
the money wasn't there?</i>

811
00:34:29,403 --> 00:34:31,037
Scanlon:
i mean, we went to the bank,

812
00:34:31,104 --> 00:34:32,772
And we opened up
the safe deposit boxes

813
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,507
You told us about,
and they were empty.

814
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:35,708
According to the manager,

815
00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:37,209
The woman
who rented them came in

816
00:34:37,277 --> 00:34:39,345
First thing in the morning,
and, uh, cleaned them out.

817
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:40,613
Woman? what woman?

818
00:34:40,681 --> 00:34:42,448
And how did she get in there?

819
00:34:42,516 --> 00:34:44,550
I thought the bank was closed
for repairs.

820
00:34:44,618 --> 00:34:46,752
It is, except
for the safe deposit boxes.

821
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,121
They're downstairs, and there
wasn't any damage down there.

822
00:34:49,189 --> 00:34:52,525
Now, as for who this woman was,
your guess is as good as mine.

823
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:54,694
The paperwork she filled out
was signed alma harrison.

824
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:56,862
Only thing
i can tell you for sure is

825
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,297
That that's not her real name.

826
00:34:58,365 --> 00:34:59,665
What do you mean?

827
00:34:59,733 --> 00:35:01,334
The driver's license,
credit card, social,

828
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:04,370
Home address she filled out
at the bank-- all that's bogus.

829
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:06,639
We don't even have
a good picture of her

830
00:35:06,707 --> 00:35:09,308
On the bank security system.

831
00:35:09,376 --> 00:35:11,277
I'm looking at the footage
that was recorded

832
00:35:11,345 --> 00:35:13,112
On the day she rented the boxes,

833
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,615
And all i can tell you is
that she's caucasian,

834
00:35:15,682 --> 00:35:17,450
Approximately five feet,
five inches,

835
00:35:17,517 --> 00:35:18,951
And knows how to duck

836
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:21,554
Every time she gets close
to one of the cameras.

837
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:23,956
Well, obviously,
she's wilkes's accomplice.

838
00:35:24,024 --> 00:35:27,226
He-he stashed the money,
and she went in to get it.

839
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:28,828
You got to bring wilkes in.

840
00:35:28,895 --> 00:35:29,996
Based on what?

841
00:35:30,063 --> 00:35:31,330
None of this proves anything.

842
00:35:31,398 --> 00:35:34,166
A woman with a fake id rented
some boxes at a bank.

843
00:35:34,234 --> 00:35:36,535
Now, would i like
to find her? sure.

844
00:35:36,603 --> 00:35:38,504
Ask her some questions
about patrick wilkes?

845
00:35:38,572 --> 00:35:39,905
Absolutely.

846
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:42,041
But i don't have a name,
and i don't have an address.

847
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:44,176
And unless you can tell me
where to locate her, i'm sorry,

848
00:35:44,244 --> 00:35:47,013
But i just can't see us bringing
a case against this guy.

849
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,748
We still friends?

850
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,850
Not so sure about that.

851
00:35:56,456 --> 00:35:57,823
You look happy.

852
00:35:57,891 --> 00:35:59,759
Looks can be deceiving.

853
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:01,827
I got some good news
and some bad news.

854
00:36:01,895 --> 00:36:02,995
Which do you want?

855
00:36:03,063 --> 00:36:05,064
Give me some good news.

856
00:36:05,132 --> 00:36:07,066
I could use some good news.

857
00:36:07,134 --> 00:36:08,834
The good news is,
the insurance company wants

858
00:36:08,902 --> 00:36:10,636
To write us a check for $2,300.

859
00:36:10,704 --> 00:36:12,405
Well, actually,
that is good news.

860
00:36:12,472 --> 00:36:13,973
So, what's the bad news?

861
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:16,542
The bad news is,
it's going to cost over $7,000

862
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:19,712
To repair your car,
which makes no sense.

863
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,248
I think we need to think
about getting a new car.

864
00:36:22,315 --> 00:36:24,483
I don't want to think
about buying a new car.

865
00:36:24,551 --> 00:36:25,918
I have other things
to think about.

866
00:36:25,986 --> 00:36:28,154
You need a car,

867
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:30,623
And putting $7,000 into one
from the early '90s...

868
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:31,924
Hey, i heard you.

869
00:36:31,992 --> 00:36:35,094
You know, most people kind of
like getting a new car.

870
00:36:35,162 --> 00:36:37,196
They think it's fun,
they find it exciting.

871
00:36:37,264 --> 00:36:39,098
Well, i'm not like most people.

872
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:41,934
You know my
dad gave me

873
00:36:42,002 --> 00:36:44,437
That car as a present
for graduating college.

874
00:36:44,504 --> 00:36:45,604
I know.

875
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:46,772
Well, did i
ever tell you

876
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,507
What i told him when
he gave it to me?

877
00:36:48,575 --> 00:36:50,242
I said i hated it.

878
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:53,646
I said, "what kind of person
gives a 21-year-old girl

879
00:36:53,714 --> 00:36:55,514
A station wagon?"

880
00:36:55,582 --> 00:36:59,652
And he just looked at me,
and he said, "it's really safe."

881
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:03,022
And he died four days later.

882
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,024
So, don't push it.

883
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:06,959
I know what i have to do.

884
00:37:07,027 --> 00:37:08,794
I've known what i had to do

885
00:37:08,862 --> 00:37:11,397
Since i had that dream
of ariel and the girls

886
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:13,866
And-and that...
that wide road and that truck.

887
00:37:13,934 --> 00:37:15,367
And i will deal with it

888
00:37:15,435 --> 00:37:17,436
When it has to
be dealt with.

889
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:20,406
<i>woman:
it's done.</i>

890
00:37:20,474 --> 00:37:22,408
Alma harrison is now
the proud renter

891
00:37:22,476 --> 00:37:26,445
Of six large safe deposit boxes
at mariposa national.

892
00:37:26,513 --> 00:37:29,315
Wilkes:
no trouble with the fake id,
the credit card?

893
00:37:29,382 --> 00:37:31,717
None. but do you want
to hear something funny?

894
00:37:31,785 --> 00:37:34,620
You gave alma the same birthday
as the bank manager.

895
00:37:34,688 --> 00:37:36,989
Told him i'd send him a card
that day.

896
00:37:37,057 --> 00:37:38,357
Aren't i an angel?

897
00:37:40,393 --> 00:37:43,129
I'm headed back
to my place now.

898
00:37:43,196 --> 00:37:44,597
Come by after work,

899
00:37:44,664 --> 00:37:47,233
And i will give you the keys
to the boxes.

901
00:37:49,302 --> 00:37:50,402
Wilkes:
what was that?

902
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,871
Uh, it's nothing.

903
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:54,006
It's the nav system in my car.

904
00:37:54,074 --> 00:37:58,077
I got a little turned around
on my way down from peoria, so

905
00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:01,013
I thought i would try
to find a quicker way back.

906
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:03,315
(navigation system beeps,
horn honking)

907
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:06,018
You still there?

908
00:38:06,086 --> 00:38:09,655
Baby, tell me you didn't just
say that you're in your car.

909
00:38:09,723 --> 00:38:12,191
Tell me you took a taxi,
like we planned.

910
00:38:12,259 --> 00:38:14,260
I didn't take a taxi, patrick.

911
00:38:14,327 --> 00:38:17,129
How many times
did we go over this?

912
00:38:17,197 --> 00:38:19,064
The bank has security cameras
outside, too.

913
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:21,167
If one of them recorded
your license plate...

914
00:38:21,234 --> 00:38:23,402
I didn't come here
in my car, okay?

915
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,904
I'm not an idiot.

916
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:26,438
I thought i should test run

917
00:38:26,506 --> 00:38:28,607
The id and credit cards
you gave me

918
00:38:28,675 --> 00:38:32,378
Before i used them at the bank,
so i rented a car for myself.

919
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:35,681
If my license plate
got recorded, who cares?

920
00:38:35,749 --> 00:38:37,116
They'll just trace it back

921
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:39,385
To the rental office
and alma harrison.

922
00:38:39,452 --> 00:38:41,420
Damn it!

923
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:43,155
What's wrong?

924
00:38:43,223 --> 00:38:46,425
I dropped my cd between
the seats, and i can't find it.

925
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:48,260
Screw it.

926
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:52,164
In a few days, i will be able
to buy all the music i want.

927
00:38:52,232 --> 00:38:55,267
If the guy at the rental office
finds it, he can keep it.

928
00:39:11,618 --> 00:39:13,652
(crickets chirping)

929
00:39:34,407 --> 00:39:36,408

<i>woman (on tv):
stunning turn of events</i>

936
00:40:01,968 --> 00:40:05,703
As lieutenant Patrick wilkes,
who only yesterday was honored

937
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:07,572
By the city
for his heroic effort

938
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:10,374
During the recent
mariposa national bank robbery,

939
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:11,676
Was arrested this morning

940
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:14,078
For masterminding
the robbery himself.

941
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:16,880
The nearly $400,000

942
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:18,848
That was thought destroyed
in the explosion

943
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,885
That rocked the downtown bank
earlier this week

944
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:24,020
Was recovered earlier today
at the home

945
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,557
Of wilkes's alleged accomplice,
erica duvall of peoria.

946
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,394
Peoria.

947
00:40:29,462 --> 00:40:30,629
Joe:
okay.

948
00:40:30,697 --> 00:40:31,863
Ready to go.

949
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:33,098
Where are the girls?

950
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:35,434
Uh, ariel already
took them to school.

951
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:37,169
Really?

952
00:40:38,204 --> 00:40:40,205

953
00:40:47,313 --> 00:40:49,314

954
00:40:53,886 --> 00:40:55,554
Come on.

955
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:57,889
Get in. we're not
walking today.

956
00:40:57,957 --> 00:40:59,057
Wow. is this new?

957
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,559
Yeah. my mom
was renting it,

958
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:02,160
And then, she called
them this morning

959
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:04,329
And told them that
she wanted to buy it.

960
00:41:04,396 --> 00:41:05,630
Nice.
yeah.

961
00:41:05,698 --> 00:41:06,864
Okay. onomatopoeia.

962
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:08,499
What a dumb word.

963
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:10,335
I didn't ask
you to judge it.

964
00:41:10,402 --> 00:41:12,337
I asked you
to spell it.
