00:00:00,254 --> 00:00:01,746
<i>Previously on Medium:</i>

2
00:00:01,747 --> 00:00:03,324
Allison, you don't look well.

3
00:00:03,325 --> 00:00:06,375
Maybe you and I should go
talk about this outside.

4
00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:11,418
They ran some tests while
you were unconscious. Um...

5
00:00:11,902 --> 00:00:14,113
I need to talk to you
about what they found.

6
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,709
A brain tumor. I know.

7
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,792
<i>- You're supposed to be in surgery right now.</i>
- Yeah, I know. I can't have that surgery.

8
00:00:20,793 --> 00:00:22,195
<i>What did you just say?</i>

9
00:00:22,196 --> 00:00:24,827
I can't have it.
At least not now.

10
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:29,094
It's going to take away my dreams, Joe.
It's going to take away my gift.

11
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:31,945
Your wife had a stroke
shortly before surgery.

12
00:00:32,204 --> 00:00:34,698
We went ahead
with the procedure anyway.

13
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:37,661
But now she's showing
no signs of consciousness.

14
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:41,457
It is impossible
to predict when or even...

15
00:00:41,577 --> 00:00:45,038
if she will ever come
out of her comatose state.

16
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,421
It's time, Mr. Dubois.

17
00:01:12,919 --> 00:01:17,920
She's been unresponsive for months.
She can't even breathe on her own.

18
00:01:18,672 --> 00:01:22,915
It's not living, Mr. Dubois.
It's not life.

19
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:28,566
I called the insurance people again.

20
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:31,646
They're not going
to change their minds...

21
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:34,674
- and the hospital...
- I know. I understand.

22
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:37,270
Um... I have no choice.

23
00:01:37,796 --> 00:01:40,296
I can't afford
to keep her alive, so...

24
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:47,955
Okay.

25
00:01:55,037 --> 00:01:58,377
Okay. Do what you...
You do what you need to do.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,027
Are you going to get that?

27
00:02:20,587 --> 00:02:23,300
- I could use a hand here.
- Yeah.

28
00:02:26,452 --> 00:02:27,588
Okay.

29
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:33,669
Here you go.

30
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,962
How did you sleep?

31
00:02:39,047 --> 00:02:41,358
Like a rock again. And you?

32
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,627
Fine.

33
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,208
So, what is that? 36 days now?
Without a dream?

34
00:02:50,293 --> 00:02:53,071
Not counting
my three months in a coma.

35
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:55,829
It's gone, Joe.

36
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,748
That surgery took it all away.
No dreams. No nothing. Just...

37
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,181
sleep.

38
00:03:11,617 --> 00:03:21,617
:::   Timecodes  -  gius   :::

39
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,823
- Bridgette!
- You hear that?

40
00:03:50,824 --> 00:03:53,245
Sounds like someone
just stepped on a cat.

41
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:57,401
Listen to me, you child of Sasquatch.
The key to Mom's car is gone.

42
00:03:57,532 --> 00:04:00,714
Okay? It was in my purse, and now it's not
there, and since you're the only one...

43
00:04:00,715 --> 00:04:04,782
around here who goes into my purse,
tell me what you did with it.

44
00:04:05,262 --> 00:04:07,271
I have a spoon,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

45
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:09,554
Okay, you know what? Look.

46
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,509
You might not like going to school,
but Marie and I do.

47
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,613
So give me the key.

48
00:04:14,735 --> 00:04:16,370
Mom! Dad!

49
00:04:17,718 --> 00:04:19,435
What's going on?

50
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:20,760
Hey.

51
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:26,281
I'm supposed to get everybody to school
and I can't find the key to your car.

52
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,122
Well, don't look at me. I haven't driven
that car in four and a half months.

53
00:04:30,123 --> 00:04:31,733
Where did you put it?

54
00:04:31,826 --> 00:04:34,448
I always leave it in my purse,
and now it's not there.

55
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:36,099
And I know who took it.

56
00:04:36,102 --> 00:04:40,102
She's always going through my purse
and stealing my money and my gum.

57
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:42,680
Are you just going to let her
ruin my good name like that?

58
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:45,493
All right, well, you're just going
to have to borrow Daddy's car.

59
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:49,438
I'm sure that my key will show up.
It's got to turn up somewhere.

60
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:51,373
Somebody mention my name?

61
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:54,772
Can Ariel borrow you car
to get everyone to school?

62
00:04:54,988 --> 00:04:58,283
Well, wait a second. I'm speaking at that
conference in Scottsdale. I need my car.

63
00:04:58,284 --> 00:05:00,834
Well, can you drop
them off on your way?

64
00:05:01,364 --> 00:05:02,735
Yeah. Okay, I suppose.

65
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:05,336
Can you pick them up
and bring them home?

66
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:07,003
Yeah. Why not?

67
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,423
I wish I was an only child.

68
00:05:10,424 --> 00:05:12,899
You know, I'm going to make it
my business to find that key.

69
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,735
It's got to be
around here somewhere.

70
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:17,873
Hey, why don't you make it
your business to rest? Huh?

71
00:05:17,874 --> 00:05:20,324
That should be your priority.
Resting.

72
00:05:20,481 --> 00:05:22,771
That and doing your exercises.

73
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:26,888
You've been in a coma for three months.
Now you're finally back home for a month.

74
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:29,144
And you're acting like
everything's back to normal.

75
00:05:29,145 --> 00:05:33,225
Well, everything is back to normal.
On the left side of my body anyway.

76
00:05:33,226 --> 00:05:35,415
Well, when you find that key...

77
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:38,148
I expect a full apology
from you-know-who.

78
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:40,522
Five minutes, we're leaving, Bridge.
Five minutes.

79
00:05:40,523 --> 00:05:41,789
Yeah.

80
00:05:43,356 --> 00:05:44,856
More hospital bills?

81
00:05:45,532 --> 00:05:49,064
Hospital. Therapy. More hospital.

82
00:05:49,825 --> 00:05:53,291
- I think I have to get a job.
- You had a job in San Diego.

83
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:55,671
You gave it up
so you could take care of me.

84
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:57,903
I think maybe it's time
to get another one.

85
00:05:57,904 --> 00:06:02,247
Hey, aren't you the guy who had that brilliant
idea for that solar cell thingamajiggy?

86
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:04,970
Yeah. Majiggy is actually
my middle name.

87
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:08,295
Ah. Well, see? There.
There you go. You have a job.

88
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:10,651
Thinking up brilliant things.

89
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:15,526
What? You don't think the world
needs more brilliant things?

90
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,989
- I'm going to get the kids to school.
- You do that. I'm going to find that key.

91
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,440
Hey, forget the key.
I'll find the key tomorrow.

92
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,071
Here goes nothing.

93
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:34,373
Allison, stop. Allison, stop.
Allison, stop.

94
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:44,118
You know, I think to myself,
I want my hand to open.

95
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,498
And it just doesn't.

96
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:49,692
And I wait.

97
00:07:53,728 --> 00:07:56,028
It's like it has a mind of its own.

98
00:07:57,403 --> 00:07:59,309
But you managed to drive here.

99
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,488
I steer with my left hand.
I drove with my left foot.

100
00:08:04,906 --> 00:08:08,907
Joe doesn't know. He doesn't...
He doesn't know I'm here, either.

101
00:08:10,346 --> 00:08:11,444
Okay.

102
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,187
Sir.

103
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:18,800
Before my surgery, I had a dream.

104
00:08:18,885 --> 00:08:22,085
It was one of the last dreams
that I ever had, and...

105
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,973
you came to me.

106
00:08:24,452 --> 00:08:26,173
You offered me a job.

107
00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:31,500
Even though I was no longer dreaming,
even though I no longer had my gift.

108
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:35,857
- Allison, you...
- Sir. Please.

109
00:08:36,403 --> 00:08:37,990
This illness...

110
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:40,476
This tumor...

111
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:43,491
It has cost my family a fortune.

112
00:08:43,904 --> 00:08:47,211
Joe had to stop doing
what he was doing in San Diego.

113
00:08:47,295 --> 00:08:51,866
And they gave him some money, but it wasn't
like he was in any position to bargain.

114
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:55,934
And he's supposed to make some money
from the royalties from his invention...

115
00:08:55,935 --> 00:09:00,088
when they start selling it,
but that's- that's a couple years off.

116
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:03,477
So I was wondering...

117
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:09,796
if maybe I could answer phones
or I could... I could do filing.

118
00:09:09,797 --> 00:09:11,400
Allison, stop.

119
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:15,907
Okay, if the phone is ringing and you
want to answer it, be my guest.

120
00:09:15,908 --> 00:09:20,050
If you see something lying around and you
want to file it, I promise not to complain.

121
00:09:20,051 --> 00:09:24,253
But even before I knew about your dreams,
you were hired to work here as a paralegal.

122
00:09:24,254 --> 00:09:26,404
And a damn fine one, as I recall.

123
00:09:26,553 --> 00:09:30,741
And I'm not about to hire
you back now as anything less.

124
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:33,423
Is that a yes?

125
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:37,620
It's going to take me a minute or two
to find the money, and it won't be full-time.

126
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:39,956
I- I don't think
I could handle full-time.

127
00:09:39,957 --> 00:09:42,126
But yes, that's a yes.

128
00:09:44,726 --> 00:09:47,539
Thank you, sir.
You won't regret it.

129
00:09:47,661 --> 00:09:49,180
Welcome back.

130
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
Our 11:00's in the conference.

131
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:54,416
What do we have here?

132
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:58,679
Come on.
If you're giving out hugs...

133
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:01,032
I had no idea
you were out and about.

134
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,181
- How you doing?
- Ah, you know.

135
00:10:03,182 --> 00:10:05,236
I have my good days.
I got my bad days.

136
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,875
I got my good side.
I got my bad side.

137
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:11,145
The good news is
my bad side's getting better...

138
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:14,003
and my good days
mostly outweigh my bad.

139
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:16,777
How is Lynn and little Lee?

140
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:20,071
Both my ladies are doing great.
Thanks.

141
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,868
Wait a second. Is Allison, uh,
here for the meeting?

142
00:10:24,084 --> 00:10:27,534
I don't know. That's, uh...
That's an interesting thought.

143
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:29,928
You free? Would you care
to sit in on something?

144
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,800
Hey, as long as it doesn't involve
physical therapy, I'm in.

145
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:34,763
After you, Dr. House.

146
00:10:35,496 --> 00:10:37,880
<i>There's no bigger Suns supporter
than me.</i>

147
00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:40,450
<i>No bigger fan
in the Phoenix metro area.</i>

148
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:43,975
<i>But I'd be lying if I said I was happy
about this latest round of trades.</i>

149
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,721
<i>Fibbing if I told you that I thought
it was good for anyone...</i>

150
00:10:46,722 --> 00:10:49,582
<i>except some accountant
who's working in the Suns' back office.</i>

151
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:53,023
<i>And good accounting rarely
makes for good basketball.</i>

152
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:56,864
<i>I'm Sophie Cullen,
and I'm your girl in the locker room.</i>

153
00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:17,389
See what I'm talking about?
He's stalking her.

154
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,290
He's stalking her with his camera.
Stalking us.

155
00:11:20,753 --> 00:11:22,771
These are public streets, Dan.

156
00:11:22,772 --> 00:11:26,397
And filming a newscast off your television
might be a little strange...

157
00:11:26,398 --> 00:11:29,341
- but I don't think it's illegal.
- Wait.

158
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:46,814
You get the idea.

159
00:11:49,364 --> 00:11:51,709
How many of these DVDs
did Miss Cullen receive?

160
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,568
Half dozen or so. But as you can see,
he's getting more brazen.

161
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:57,400
I mean, he's no longer just
videotaping her in the streets.

162
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:00,939
He's pursuing her in stores
and restaurants. He's peeping.

163
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,556
I mean, both of us fear it's only a matter
of time before he shows up at her door.

164
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,292
And I won't lie to you.
It's taking its toll on both of us.

165
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,583
I'm sorry.
I'm confused about the relationship.

166
00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:11,851
Uh, you're the station manager?

167
00:12:12,195 --> 00:12:13,030
Owner.

168
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:16,257
Dan-- Mr. Taper owns
several television stations.

169
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:18,495
Yeah, a couple of newspapers, too.

170
00:12:18,496 --> 00:12:20,896
You know anyone
who wants to buy one?

171
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:23,840
In answer to your question,
Miss Cohen is my employee.

172
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:26,845
She's also my wife.
Has been for a little over a year.

173
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,391
This fellow,
we know where he lives.

174
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:32,663
We know who he is.
That's his name and address.

175
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:35,653
I really feel we're dealing with
some form of mental illness here...

176
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:39,157
and I just think it would be helpful
before something gets out of hand...

177
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:42,130
before something horrible happens,
if someone from this office...

178
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:45,500
somebody from the police department
could pay this fellow a visit...

179
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:48,712
put him on notice, make it clear
to him he's being watched.

180
00:12:48,713 --> 00:12:53,163
I got a pretty full slate today,
but I'd be happy to pay him a visit tomorrow.

181
00:12:53,353 --> 00:12:56,030
You back on the clock?
Should I pick you up in the morning?

182
00:12:56,031 --> 00:12:59,399
Well, I don't know.
Am I back on the clock tomorrow?

183
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:05,506
- Hey.
- Hey.

184
00:13:06,141 --> 00:13:08,541
Don't look now,
but Marie got pinned.

185
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,333
- What's that?
- Pinned.

186
00:13:10,334 --> 00:13:12,942
Marie got pinned.
When they give you something...

187
00:13:12,943 --> 00:13:15,997
and they really want your parents
to see it, they pin it to you.

188
00:13:15,998 --> 00:13:17,983
Daddy, take it off.

189
00:13:18,403 --> 00:13:20,077
Career Day is tomorrow?

190
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,473
Yup, we're "D"s.
"A" through "D" is tomorrow.

191
00:13:23,923 --> 00:13:26,696
Apparently, the other parents
found out last week.

192
00:13:26,697 --> 00:13:30,173
I'm guessing that somebody kept
forgetting to give us the flyer.

193
00:13:30,174 --> 00:13:31,333
Marie!

194
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:34,310
Okay, so who's gonna go?
Which one of us is gonna do it?

195
00:13:34,311 --> 00:13:37,052
Interesting question,
given that neither of us have jobs.

196
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:40,703
Well, actually, I need to talk to you
about that after dinner.

197
00:13:40,704 --> 00:13:42,605
I don't know
which infuriates me more:

198
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:45,694
that you went ahead and did this without
even bothering to discuss it with me...

199
00:13:45,695 --> 00:13:48,797
or that you drove there
when half your body still doesn't work.

200
00:13:48,798 --> 00:13:51,429
Well, I didn't think it was important
to discuss it with you...

201
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,788
because honestly, I thought it was very
unlikely that he would offer me anything.

202
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:57,445
Why? He likes you. You worked there for years.
Why wouldn't he want you back?

203
00:13:57,446 --> 00:14:00,213
Okay, well, let's start with the fact
that I can no longer do that...

204
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,611
clever little parlor trick
that he used to find so useful.

205
00:14:03,612 --> 00:14:06,588
And like you said,
half my body doesn't work.

206
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:09,026
This is not how it's supposed to go.
You should be devoting your time...

207
00:14:09,027 --> 00:14:12,528
to getting better, building your health.
I should be the one that gets a job, not you.

208
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:15,529
Honey, we have been through this.
You have a job.

209
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:17,317
You're an inventor.

210
00:14:17,586 --> 00:14:20,586
You just need a little time
and a little freedom.

211
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:24,802
And I want to do this for you.
I want to give this to you.

212
00:14:25,093 --> 00:14:27,018
Haven't you sacrificed
enough already?

213
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:30,393
No. It's not a sacrifice
when it's about you.

214
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,841
And I'm worried about your health.

215
00:14:33,842 --> 00:14:38,597
Honey, when I was at work,
I felt great, amazing.

216
00:14:38,598 --> 00:14:41,309
Almost, almost like I was normal.

217
00:14:41,703 --> 00:14:44,442
You know, it's only
gonna start off part-time.

218
00:14:44,443 --> 00:14:47,212
And for tomorrow at least,
Lee's gonna give me a ride.

219
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:51,645
Tomorrow? Uh-huh. Well, I guess
we know who's going to Marie's class.

220
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:55,990
Honey... watch this.

221
00:14:59,956 --> 00:15:01,266
Come on.

222
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:11,973
Very impressive.

223
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:15,458
Not only that,
when I was at work today...

224
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:19,083
I felt this, this little flicker
in my head.

225
00:15:20,012 --> 00:15:23,288
- Well, I don't like the sound of that.
- No, no, no, it was good.

226
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,831
It was like seeing
a teeny, tiny piece of the future.

227
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:30,457
Like seeing a sliver of something
that's gonna happen.

228
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:34,379
It was Devalos, and he kept saying
something to me over and over again.

229
00:15:34,473 --> 00:15:36,469
And then it stopped.

230
00:15:37,211 --> 00:15:39,614
And then he actually said it.

231
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:42,138
Okay.

232
00:15:42,392 --> 00:15:46,005
Well, it felt like it was coming
from the same place in my dreams...

233
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:49,290
and the things I used to be able
to do came from.

234
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,044
Like maybe it's...

235
00:15:54,297 --> 00:15:56,086
maybe it's healing.

236
00:15:56,546 --> 00:15:58,525
Maybe it's coming back.

237
00:16:02,453 --> 00:16:04,867
Well, you don't look pleased.

238
00:16:09,443 --> 00:16:13,079
I guess I was just getting used
to the idea of this, this new you.

239
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,604
You don't sound like
you like the old me very much.

240
00:16:15,605 --> 00:16:18,810
Come on. That's not fair. You didn't like
the old you very much either.

241
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,544
That thing you're calling a gift?
It brought an awful lot of darkness with it...

242
00:16:22,545 --> 00:16:25,145
to you, to me,
to everyone in this house.

243
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:27,303
Can you blame me for not missing it?

244
00:16:27,304 --> 00:16:31,803
Can you blame me for maybe hoping
that's the one part of you that doesn't heal?

245
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:45,829
Very impressive.

246
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:50,135
Anything else?

247
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:54,092
Any other part of you
that hasn't wiggled in a while...

248
00:16:56,127 --> 00:16:58,362
that's suddenly come to life?

249
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:00,759
Nope.

250
00:17:02,148 --> 00:17:04,917
Yeah, well, that's plenty
enough for me.

251
00:17:15,574 --> 00:17:16,724
Peter Winant?

252
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:21,947
I'm Detective Lee Scanlon.
This is my colleague Allison Dubois.

253
00:17:21,948 --> 00:17:25,274
We were hoping you had
a few minutes to talk.

254
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:28,141
About time you folks came around.

255
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,736
Every day I have to paint
six or seven doors...

256
00:17:30,737 --> 00:17:33,287
and every night
those taggers come back.

257
00:17:34,005 --> 00:17:36,897
My phone starts ringing
every morning at 7:00 am...

258
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:39,048
tenants calling with work orders.

259
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:43,001
I can show you what they look like.
I don't have any names or anything...

260
00:17:43,002 --> 00:17:45,918
Actually, Mr. Winant,
the tagging and whatnot...

261
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,719
that's not why we're here.

262
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:50,657
We're here to talk to you
about Sophie Cullen.

263
00:17:54,231 --> 00:17:55,179
Sophie?

264
00:17:55,377 --> 00:17:57,127
You've been watching her...

265
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,672
following her, recording her...

266
00:17:59,673 --> 00:18:02,023
making DVDs and sending them to her.

267
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:05,320
She's very disturbed by it,
Mr. Winant.

268
00:18:06,956 --> 00:18:08,337
I doubt that.

269
00:18:10,926 --> 00:18:13,845
Did she come to you?
Did she complain?

270
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:15,577
No. Her husband did.

271
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,319
So I guess he finally knows.

272
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:27,625
- Knows what?
- About us. About me and Sophie.

273
00:18:29,684 --> 00:18:31,383
About our love.

274
00:18:37,624 --> 00:18:40,174
I can't imagine
what he must be feeling.

275
00:18:40,647 --> 00:18:42,910
And what a way to find out.

276
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,342
I wonder which ones he saw.

277
00:18:45,343 --> 00:18:47,793
I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I'm following.

278
00:18:48,313 --> 00:18:50,999
Are you trying to tell us
that Ms. Cullen knows you?

279
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,327
Knows of you?

280
00:18:52,472 --> 00:18:55,580
I mean, you know,
as anything other than a fan?

281
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:59,146
I'm trying to tell you
that we're lovers.

282
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:04,383
Why do you look so shocked?

283
00:19:05,305 --> 00:19:08,086
Why does it strike you
as incongruous that...

284
00:19:08,087 --> 00:19:11,255
two people who look so different...

285
00:19:11,256 --> 00:19:15,205
who seem so different
would be drawn to one another?

286
00:19:15,206 --> 00:19:18,153
Why do you assume
we have nothing in common?

287
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:21,097
You do understand, Mr. Winant,
that I'm gonna have to go back...

288
00:19:21,098 --> 00:19:24,648
to Ms. Cullen to corroborate
that her version of your, uh...

289
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:26,513
friendship is the same as yours.

290
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:28,740
And if it isn't,
I'm putting you on notice.

291
00:19:28,741 --> 00:19:31,065
We know who you are.
We know where you live.

292
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:34,361
You so much as cross the street against
the light in pursuit of Ms. Cullen...

293
00:19:34,362 --> 00:19:35,912
you're going to jail.

294
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:38,877
She worships me...

295
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,955
and I her.

296
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:46,807
The best thing about
being an inventor?

297
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,428
Um, wow, that's a tough one.

298
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:54,174
I guess it would have to be that you can,
you can do your job anywhere.

299
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:58,260
I mean, you know, at home,
in your car, on a plane.

300
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:01,259
As long as you remember
to bring your brain...

301
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,821
the whole world is your office.

302
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:08,864
Does anybody else have a...?

303
00:20:11,353 --> 00:20:14,048
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

304
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:16,458
It sounds like a great job.

305
00:20:16,571 --> 00:20:18,571
Yeah, it is.
It's a great job.

306
00:20:18,768 --> 00:20:22,526
But what happens
if you never have another idea?

307
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:26,641
Excuse me?

308
00:20:26,735 --> 00:20:30,746
Well, you said an inventor only
gets paid when he has an idea.

309
00:20:31,028 --> 00:20:34,723
So, what if you never have
another idea?

310
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:36,753
Well, but I will.

311
00:20:37,175 --> 00:20:40,944
Okay.
But... what if you don't?

312
00:20:44,404 --> 00:20:45,897
But I will.

313
00:20:56,008 --> 00:20:58,721
- Hi. Let's go to bed.
- Uh, yeah, in a minute.

314
00:20:58,722 --> 00:21:02,472
I'm just, you know, trying to make
myself jump-start some ideas.

315
00:21:03,451 --> 00:21:06,118
Can you do that?
Can you make yourself have an idea?

316
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:10,872
Uh, I don't know. But based on
the evidence at hand, I tend to think not.

317
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,216
Okay.
Well, then let's go to bed.

318
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:17,829
Why bother spinning your wheels?
Pick it up in the morning.

319
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,298
I don't know. I guess I'm just worried
that I'm never going to have another idea.

320
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:23,788
But you will.

321
00:21:24,107 --> 00:21:25,930
But what if I don't?

322
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:29,615
Most people don't have
a single world-class idea...

323
00:21:29,616 --> 00:21:32,360
in their entire lives.
And I had one.

324
00:21:32,952 --> 00:21:34,838
Do you know how lucky
that makes me?

325
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:38,139
You're driving yourself crazy.
You're driving me crazy.

326
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,490
It's 10:00.
Let's go to bed.

327
00:22:13,478 --> 00:22:15,271
<i>911 how can I help you?</i>

328
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,103
Please, please, please come.

329
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,714
I'm hurt.

330
00:22:20,137 --> 00:22:21,844
<i>Ma'am I can hardly hear you.</i>

331
00:22:21,845 --> 00:22:23,474
He broke in.

332
00:22:24,472 --> 00:22:26,116
He raped me.

333
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:29,154
He... he stabbed me.

334
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:31,135
<i>What is your location?</i>

335
00:22:31,136 --> 00:22:34,232
And he- he killed my husband.

336
00:22:39,075 --> 00:22:41,002
What if I don't?

337
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,744
Most people don't have
a single world-class idea...

338
00:22:44,745 --> 00:22:47,496
in their entire lives.
And I had one.

339
00:22:48,218 --> 00:22:50,950
Do you know how lucky
that makes me?

340
00:22:57,303 --> 00:22:58,777
Yeah, hello.

341
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:03,434
Yeah, she's right here, Detective.
Something's happened.

342
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,524
No, tell them I already
know what happened.

343
00:23:05,525 --> 00:23:08,354
Peter Winant broke
into Sophie Cullen's home.

344
00:23:08,457 --> 00:23:12,152
He killed her husband,
stabbed her and raped her.

345
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:15,333
Wait a second. How can you know that?
You don't dream anymore.

346
00:23:15,334 --> 00:23:17,005
We haven't even been to bed yet.

347
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:21,094
Well, I hate to disappoint you,
but that's all about to change.

348
00:23:22,345 --> 00:23:25,617
Well, it started after we left
the dining room. Then we went to bed.

349
00:23:25,618 --> 00:23:27,997
But we didn't go to bed.
We haven't gone to bed.

350
00:23:27,998 --> 00:23:29,846
Not yet.
Well, at least I haven't.

351
00:23:29,847 --> 00:23:33,182
I'm just trying to explain
what this experience was like...

352
00:23:33,183 --> 00:23:34,583
what it felt like.

353
00:23:34,716 --> 00:23:36,575
So, I had a dream.

354
00:23:36,576 --> 00:23:39,450
In it, I saw everything
that Scanlon just said happened.

355
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,991
Then I woke up and I realized
none of it had happened--

356
00:23:41,992 --> 00:23:44,591
the sleeping, the dreaming.

357
00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:48,306
That I was still standing
in the dining room with you.

358
00:23:49,699 --> 00:23:51,896
Look... honey...

359
00:23:52,103 --> 00:23:55,727
I think this part of my body--
it's trying to heal.

360
00:23:55,728 --> 00:23:59,569
It's trying to figure out
how to work...

361
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,728
just like the right side
of my body is.

362
00:24:01,729 --> 00:24:03,817
Okay.
But hold on a second.

363
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:07,390
So, before you had the operation,
you had a dream.

364
00:24:07,942 --> 00:24:11,379
You dreamt that they'd operate on your brain
and then your gift would disappear.

365
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,652
Now you're telling me
that that dream was wrong?

366
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:16,364
That- that all the dreams you had
before the operation-- they were wrong?

367
00:24:16,365 --> 00:24:17,526
They were wrong.

368
00:24:17,527 --> 00:24:20,606
I didn't have the exact operation
that I dreamt about.

369
00:24:20,607 --> 00:24:22,531
I delayed that. Remember?

370
00:24:22,532 --> 00:24:25,526
That's why they couldn't cut out
the whole tumor out of my head.

371
00:24:25,527 --> 00:24:28,704
Maybe that's why.
It's been happening for a few days--

372
00:24:28,705 --> 00:24:30,844
this- this little flickering.

373
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,945
- You didn't tell me.
- I tried to.

374
00:24:34,293 --> 00:24:36,143
You didn't react very well.

375
00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:38,011
Well, hold on a second.
When was this?

376
00:24:38,012 --> 00:24:39,624
It was never. It...

377
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:42,809
it was going to happen.
I didn't allow it to.

378
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:45,576
Just like I saw a dream
I know I'm going to have.

379
00:24:45,577 --> 00:24:47,414
I didn't want to have
this conversation.

380
00:24:47,415 --> 00:24:48,992
Okay, I see. So...

381
00:24:49,313 --> 00:24:52,672
you made this decision based not
on something that I did...

382
00:24:52,673 --> 00:24:55,632
but on something that you believe
that I was going to do...

383
00:24:55,633 --> 00:24:57,726
which, by the way,
I have not actually done yet.

384
00:24:57,727 --> 00:24:59,051
Yeah, that's about right.

385
00:24:59,052 --> 00:25:01,469
Okay, well, thanks for giving me
the benefit of the doubt.

386
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,997
And, uh, do me a favor.
When you actually have this dream...

387
00:25:03,998 --> 00:25:06,699
that you already know you're gonna have,
don't bother waking me up.

388
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,788
We both already know
that I'll react badly.

389
00:25:12,461 --> 00:25:15,569
I didn't see him at first
as much as I, um...

390
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,098
felt him.

391
00:25:19,202 --> 00:25:22,028
His bigness, his breath.

392
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:28,172
I mean, I was dead asleep,
and it was dark, and all of the sudden...

393
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:31,534
I'm aware that there's
someone tearing at me.

394
00:25:31,727 --> 00:25:34,735
And I knew where I was.
I knew...

395
00:25:35,055 --> 00:25:36,435
I knew I was in my bedroom.

396
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:40,586
And I also knew that my husband
wasn't there 'cause I couldn't feel him.

397
00:25:42,346 --> 00:25:44,145
I couldn't smell him.

398
00:25:44,324 --> 00:25:45,339
So...

399
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,122
I- I started screaming for him.

400
00:25:49,944 --> 00:25:53,698
I mean, while there's this other person
pulling at me and...

401
00:25:53,858 --> 00:25:56,069
and grunting at me.

402
00:25:56,749 --> 00:25:59,930
His hand was over my mouth,
and I just remember...

403
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:02,209
shutting my eyes.

404
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:07,158
I thought he was gonna break me.

405
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:13,399
And somewhere in there...

406
00:26:14,382 --> 00:26:16,204
I guess I blacked out.

407
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:17,789
And...

408
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:21,535
when I came to, he was gone.

409
00:26:23,274 --> 00:26:27,274
My stomach-- the left side
was throbbing.

410
00:26:28,813 --> 00:26:32,313
That's when I saw the blood
and realized he had stabbed me.

411
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,852
I tried to get up...

412
00:26:35,998 --> 00:26:38,939
but I couldn't,
so I- I dragged myself...

413
00:26:39,061 --> 00:26:43,137
across the floor, out of the bedroom
and went looking for Dan.

414
00:26:49,223 --> 00:26:51,289
I found him in the kitchen.

415
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:56,649
But at some point,
you did get a look at him?

416
00:26:56,661 --> 00:26:57,710
Yeah.

417
00:26:58,881 --> 00:27:02,440
I was able to turn around
for just a moment.

418
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,941
He looked like a rhino.

419
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,467
Like an angry rhino.

420
00:27:13,044 --> 00:27:15,806
He can't be that hard to find,
a creature like that.

421
00:27:15,807 --> 00:27:19,101
He can't.
He can't be that hard to find.

422
00:27:19,214 --> 00:27:20,686
We'll find him.

423
00:27:21,771 --> 00:27:23,171
But until we do...

424
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:27,848
you'll have two police outside your door
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

425
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:30,753
Everything she just told us
in there, I saw it, Lee.

426
00:27:30,754 --> 00:27:34,052
I saw it the other day when
we were visiting that monster.

427
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:36,896
- What are you talking about?
- I saw them making love.

428
00:27:36,897 --> 00:27:39,028
At least I thought that's what I saw.

429
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:42,298
I- I thought I was seeing some
kind of fantasy in his head...

430
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,492
but I guess I was just
seeing him rape her.

431
00:27:44,493 --> 00:27:46,849
And I could've stopped it, Lee.
We could've stopped it.

432
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,332
Wait a second.

433
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,162
First of all, you weren't even sure
you were psychic yesterday.

434
00:27:51,163 --> 00:27:53,077
Second of all,
how could you have stopped it?

435
00:27:53,078 --> 00:27:55,617
You can't lock someone up
for something he hasn't done yet.

436
00:27:55,618 --> 00:27:58,423
Especially someone with an absolutely
clean record like that guy has.

437
00:27:58,424 --> 00:27:59,935
I don't care.

438
00:28:08,435 --> 00:28:10,873
- Hi. Joe Dubois, right?
- Yeah.

439
00:28:10,874 --> 00:28:14,463
I'm Drew Campbell. We met
at the kindergarten play last year...

440
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,222
the four food group thing.

441
00:28:16,223 --> 00:28:17,755
Oh, right. Okay.

442
00:28:17,756 --> 00:28:21,556
Yeah, my boy got a real kick out
of your career day presentation.

443
00:28:21,723 --> 00:28:26,006
He came home, told me all about it.
All about that solar cell you built.

444
00:28:26,007 --> 00:28:27,318
He did?

445
00:28:27,853 --> 00:28:30,047
I'm a corporate recruiter.

446
00:28:30,637 --> 00:28:34,937
A headhunter. I work with all the major
engineering firms in the Southwest.

447
00:28:36,221 --> 00:28:38,159
I could sell the hell out of you.

448
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,953
That's not what I read in the papers.
What I read in the papers is that...

449
00:28:40,954 --> 00:28:42,868
when it comes to jobs,
no one's hiring.

450
00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:46,896
I'm just saying that companies
focusing on green technology...

451
00:28:46,897 --> 00:28:50,121
are pretty flush with
stimulus money right now.

452
00:28:50,511 --> 00:28:52,915
- All of them are hiring.
- Okay, if you say so.

453
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:55,075
But my background
is in- in aeronautics.

454
00:28:55,076 --> 00:28:57,857
I don't know anything
about doing engineering.

455
00:28:57,858 --> 00:29:00,505
Joe, you built a solar cell.

456
00:29:00,921 --> 00:29:03,579
It doesn't get
much greener than that.

457
00:29:04,527 --> 00:29:07,616
Hey, limo?
Somebody call for a limo?

458
00:29:09,641 --> 00:29:12,855
Now, that is what I call service.

459
00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:16,335
Do you think the restrooms
are still open in there?

460
00:29:16,336 --> 00:29:17,636
Guess so.

461
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,927
Two minutes.

462
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:23,109
Well, that is not
what I call service.

463
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:33,817
She made a fool out of me.

464
00:29:35,034 --> 00:29:38,442
Even now, she's laughing at me.

465
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,149
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
Joe said I could find you here.

466
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,400
- What's going on?
- Peter Winant.

467
00:29:50,844 --> 00:29:54,730
About a half hour ago, he tried to force
his way into Sophie Cullen's hospital room.

468
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:58,688
One of the officers we had stationed there
ordered him to freeze; Winant went after him.

469
00:29:58,689 --> 00:30:02,370
The other officer put one
in his neck, two in his back.

470
00:30:06,046 --> 00:30:08,046
Hey, penny for your thoughts.

471
00:30:08,938 --> 00:30:11,788
I'm not sure you would get
your money's worth.

472
00:30:11,905 --> 00:30:14,789
Just thinking about
how random life is.

473
00:30:15,923 --> 00:30:20,215
One day there's this couple, you know,
happy, they're living their life.

474
00:30:20,216 --> 00:30:22,865
And this other guy comes along...

475
00:30:23,603 --> 00:30:26,003
kills the husband, tortures the wife.

476
00:30:26,096 --> 00:30:27,198
Random.

477
00:30:27,654 --> 00:30:29,376
Now he's dead, too.

478
00:30:31,152 --> 00:30:32,732
Completely random.

479
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:36,660
Yeah. Hey, speaking of random,
this guy came up to me in school.

480
00:30:36,821 --> 00:30:40,518
Uh, his kid told him about
my presentation on career day.

481
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:43,369
Turns out, he thinks
he may have a job for me.

482
00:30:43,665 --> 00:30:46,279
W- What are you talking about?
We've been through this.

483
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,866
There are no jobs.

484
00:30:48,092 --> 00:30:52,409
Not in aeronautics, not in Phoenix.
Besides, you're not looking for a job.

485
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,356
I don't know.
I might be.

486
00:30:55,776 --> 00:30:58,527
You know, I miss
seeing people every day.

487
00:30:58,528 --> 00:31:01,296
I mean, people other than my kids
in the rearview mirror...

488
00:31:01,297 --> 00:31:03,147
when I take them to school.

489
00:31:03,456 --> 00:31:07,249
I miss drinking coffee that
I didn't have to make myself.

490
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,834
I- I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I miss commuting a little, you know?

491
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:14,091
I miss being by myself
and listening to the radio.

492
00:31:14,504 --> 00:31:15,997
I do. I miss it.

493
00:31:16,371 --> 00:31:18,895
I miss working for someone.
I miss having a job.

494
00:31:18,896 --> 00:31:21,950
Okay, well, maybe you should call
this magic man, this man...

495
00:31:21,951 --> 00:31:25,249
who knows about all these magic jobs
that no one else knows about.

496
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,907
They're green jobs.

497
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:30,654
Turns out I'm green engineer,
and I didn't even know it.

498
00:31:31,249 --> 00:31:34,147
I don't care
what color engineer you are...

499
00:31:34,347 --> 00:31:36,830
as long as you're a happy engineer.

500
00:31:56,794 --> 00:32:00,606
Hey. That's not all for you,
you know.

501
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,451
I don't want to leave.

502
00:32:32,071 --> 00:32:35,021
- Why do I have to leave?
- Because I'm married.

503
00:32:35,089 --> 00:32:38,471
And my husband's gonna be
home soon and because...

504
00:32:39,467 --> 00:32:41,465
you know the answer.

505
00:32:43,472 --> 00:32:45,050
What if I just stay?

506
00:32:45,303 --> 00:32:49,695
What if I just don't leave
and we wait for him to get home?

507
00:32:50,182 --> 00:32:51,712
And then he knows.

508
00:32:51,843 --> 00:32:55,164
And then nothing will matter
and then we can get on with it.

509
00:32:55,165 --> 00:32:58,191
It's not that easy, Peter.
I've explained this to you.

510
00:32:58,192 --> 00:33:00,031
I need a job.

511
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:03,385
You're gonna have to
give me time to find work...

512
00:33:03,386 --> 00:33:06,111
at another station
before we can tell anyone.

513
00:33:06,112 --> 00:33:07,135
Okay?

514
00:33:08,412 --> 00:33:11,867
It's hard to wait. I...

515
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:17,407
I want to spend
a whole night with you.

516
00:33:18,551 --> 00:33:20,655
I want to wake up with you.

517
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,304
I want that too.

518
00:33:25,347 --> 00:33:27,009
Soon, my love.

519
00:33:27,988 --> 00:33:29,650
I promise.

520
00:34:47,887 --> 00:34:50,815
You sit tight.
I'll be right back.

521
00:35:23,563 --> 00:35:25,771
You're going home today?

522
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:29,181
Yeah, they're letting me leave
in a couple hours.

523
00:35:29,182 --> 00:35:32,047
The nurses showed me how to dress
my wounds last night.

524
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:33,602
That's amazing.

525
00:35:34,026 --> 00:35:36,805
Two stab wounds
and no lasting damage.

526
00:35:36,899 --> 00:35:40,087
Well, I don't know.
You haven't seen the two scars...

527
00:35:40,088 --> 00:35:42,244
I'm going to be left with
for the rest of my life.

528
00:35:42,245 --> 00:35:43,470
But still.

529
00:35:43,602 --> 00:35:46,821
I mean, no major organs struck.

530
00:35:46,822 --> 00:35:49,997
No nerves severed.
It's almost as if whoever did this...

531
00:35:49,998 --> 00:35:53,443
was determined to do
as little damage as possible.

532
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,410
Excuse me? "Whoever did this?"
Peter Winant did this.

533
00:35:57,411 --> 00:36:00,062
He killed my husband
and he tried to kill me.

534
00:36:00,063 --> 00:36:01,514
If you say so.

535
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:04,117
Well, wait a minute.
Who doesn't say so?

536
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:07,878
I don't know. I just know that Peter thinks
you made a fool out of him.

537
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:09,722
Peter thinks that...

538
00:36:14,944 --> 00:36:18,542
You're that Mrs. Dubois.
I hadn't put it together.

539
00:36:18,993 --> 00:36:22,184
Well, little does he know
he's just the tip of the iceberg.

540
00:36:22,185 --> 00:36:24,903
Yes, you made a fool out of Peter.
You made a fool out of your husband.

541
00:36:24,904 --> 00:36:27,448
You're making a fool
out of the whole justice system.

542
00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:29,493
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

543
00:36:29,494 --> 00:36:32,319
He must have been thrilled
the day you answered him.

544
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,438
The day you reached out.
How did it start?

545
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:37,589
Did he send you a mash-up
of yourself on television?

546
00:36:37,678 --> 00:36:40,724
And what, what did his face look like
when you agreed to meet with him?

547
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:43,755
Now that, that's a DVD
I'd like to see.

548
00:36:44,533 --> 00:36:46,392
How about when you slept with him?

549
00:36:46,393 --> 00:36:48,833
Or when you told him
that you loved him?

550
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:50,836
What, no- no recording of that?

551
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,949
What seems to be the problem,
Ms. Cullen?

552
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,690
Could you send somebody by, please?

553
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:57,251
How about when you stabbed yourself?

554
00:36:57,535 --> 00:37:00,889
Could you please not block the door?
There's a nurse that's coming here any minute.

555
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,687
What about when you stabbed
your husband to death?

556
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,488
No footage of that either?

557
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,923
It's funny. I don't see that police detective
you came here with the other day.

558
00:37:09,924 --> 00:37:12,392
Could it be that this visit
isn't official business?

559
00:37:12,393 --> 00:37:16,234
That what you're doing right now
amounts to nothing more than harassment?

560
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,467
Isn't this the moment
that you're gonna remind me...

561
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:21,505
what a wealthy woman you are now
and how many television stations...

562
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:25,682
and newspapers you own
and how you employ tens of attorneys...

563
00:37:25,683 --> 00:37:29,779
all of whom you're going to sic on me
if I don't leave this very minute?

564
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,397
Well, don't worry.
I'm leaving.

565
00:37:33,444 --> 00:37:35,697
But you'll be seeing me.

566
00:37:49,362 --> 00:37:51,812
- Tell me you're done.
- I'm not done.

567
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:55,082
You're not done, meaning, uh,
I have more to look at?

568
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:57,735
Or you're not done 'cause you
haven't found what you want to find...

569
00:37:57,736 --> 00:38:00,036
even though you've already
looked at everything ten times?

570
00:38:00,037 --> 00:38:01,387
I'm not done yet.

571
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,460
Come on, Allison. We've already
been here for three hours.

572
00:38:04,461 --> 00:38:07,612
This joint's the size of a shoe box.
If you don't see it, it isn't here.

573
00:38:07,613 --> 00:38:10,463
It's got to be.
I just know it. I can feel it.

574
00:38:10,464 --> 00:38:13,099
They were involved.
I can smell it.

575
00:38:13,596 --> 00:38:16,657
Come to your senses.
There's no way that guy...

576
00:38:16,835 --> 00:38:20,276
and that girl were...
what was the word you used?

577
00:38:20,394 --> 00:38:22,496
- Involved.
- Involved.

578
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,190
Anywhere other than in his head.

579
00:38:27,155 --> 00:38:29,705
You find a souvenir pair
of her panties?

580
00:38:29,803 --> 00:38:32,858
Under the mattress?
Hidden in the closet?

581
00:38:33,071 --> 00:38:36,607
Come on, you know that's what
you're gonna need to make the case.

582
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:38,367
How about a love letter?

583
00:38:38,461 --> 00:38:42,103
You don't even have a photograph with the two
of them in it 'cause they weren't together.

584
00:38:42,104 --> 00:38:43,622
I told you I'm not done yet.

585
00:38:43,623 --> 00:38:47,286
Well, I'm done and I'm your ride.
Come on.

586
00:38:58,365 --> 00:38:59,980
Look at that door.

587
00:39:00,365 --> 00:39:02,525
Not only are we not
going to clear his name...

588
00:39:02,526 --> 00:39:04,808
we didn't even try to find
the little turds...

589
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,643
who were making his life
miserable by doing this.

590
00:39:07,644 --> 00:39:10,256
It's kind of a moot point
at this juncture, Allison.

591
00:39:10,257 --> 00:39:12,657
Lee, let's go back inside,
look at the security tape...

592
00:39:12,658 --> 00:39:14,358
and see if we can ID them.

593
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:17,652
- What are you talking about?
- The taggers-- they're on the tape.

594
00:39:17,653 --> 00:39:21,126
Anyone around this apartment
would be on that tape.

595
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:25,020
Oh, my God, Lee...

596
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:38,598
Ah, Miss Cullen,
thank you for joining us.

597
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:42,149
You're just in time.
We were about to watch some television.

598
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,536
Should I have brought a lawyer?

599
00:39:44,537 --> 00:39:48,428
If you're asking me if you're about to be
charged with anything, absolutely not.

600
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:52,100
We simply want to give you a progress report
on the investigation into your husband's death.

601
00:39:52,101 --> 00:39:55,191
- Please.
- But we know who killed my husband.

602
00:39:55,633 --> 00:39:58,261
It was the same man
who attacked me, raped me.

603
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:01,181
And he's dead, so there's
nothing to investigate.

604
00:40:01,182 --> 00:40:03,382
Are you referring to your stalker?

605
00:40:03,383 --> 00:40:07,384
The man you told us you never saw
until the night he broke into your home?

606
00:40:07,385 --> 00:40:08,351
That's right.

607
00:40:08,352 --> 00:40:11,300
Well, what if we were to tell you
we had surveillance footage of you...

608
00:40:11,301 --> 00:40:14,600
making your way into and out of Peter's
apartment on two different evenings...

609
00:40:14,601 --> 00:40:16,401
after your late newscast?

610
00:40:16,649 --> 00:40:19,794
- Surveillance footage?
- There was a problem with vandals.

611
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:23,296
Peter was determined to catch them.
He set up security cameras.

612
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:25,352
He had a monitor
right there in his apartment.

613
00:40:25,353 --> 00:40:27,406
I'm guessing
he must have shut it off...

614
00:40:27,407 --> 00:40:30,154
when he was entertaining you
or else you would've seen it.

615
00:40:30,155 --> 00:40:31,679
Even though it was night...

616
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,111
even though you were wearing
sunglasses, I'm quite sure...

617
00:40:34,112 --> 00:40:37,520
that a jury will have
no problem believing it's you.

618
00:40:42,623 --> 00:40:44,566
And what will that prove?

619
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,008
It'll prove you're a liar,
for one thing.

620
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:48,991
A liar... perhaps...

621
00:40:49,798 --> 00:40:51,039
but not a killer.

622
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,823
You're quite right about that,
Miss Cullen.

623
00:40:52,824 --> 00:40:56,374
We have no proof that you took
your husband's life, not yet.

624
00:40:56,655 --> 00:41:00,124
But I did take the liberty of sending this
footage to every news outlet in the city...

625
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:04,515
including, by the way, the one
that you own or... owned.

626
00:41:05,304 --> 00:41:07,738
Apparently,
it's going to be a huge story.

627
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:12,553
A public figure in an adulterous relationship
with the man she claimed to be her stalker?

628
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:16,027
We also made sure that your late
husband's family got to see the footage.

629
00:41:16,028 --> 00:41:17,882
They had some interesting
things to say.

630
00:41:17,883 --> 00:41:20,971
They told us that you and your late
husband signed prenuptial agreements.

631
00:41:20,972 --> 00:41:24,224
And it turns out that even the appearance
of an adulterous relationship...

632
00:41:24,225 --> 00:41:27,585
is enough to render those
agreements null and void.

633
00:41:28,045 --> 00:41:32,372
By the way, they asked me to ask you to do
them the courtesy of skipping the funeral.

634
00:41:32,373 --> 00:41:34,946
They said there will be
plenty of time to catch up...

635
00:41:34,947 --> 00:41:38,326
when they see you in court
to contest the estate.

636
00:41:40,473 --> 00:41:42,123
Is there anything else?

637
00:41:43,027 --> 00:41:44,758
Am I free to go?

638
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:46,967
You can go.

639
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:52,616
But I'm not sure how,
uh, free you'll feel.

640
00:41:53,189 --> 00:41:56,133
I'm reopening the investigation
into your husband's death.

641
00:41:56,134 --> 00:41:58,048
You're the main suspect.

642
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:01,756
Thanks for coming in.

643
00:42:12,604 --> 00:42:14,572
It's good to have you back.

644
00:42:14,957 --> 00:42:16,766
It's good to be here.

645
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:20,383
I don't know. I have a good
feeling about this guy.

646
00:42:20,384 --> 00:42:22,695
I just kind of trust him.
Thank you, sweetie.

647
00:42:22,696 --> 00:42:25,239
And he says he's already got
a couple interviews set up for me.

648
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,466
Well, if you're sure that's
what you want. Thanks, honey.

649
00:42:27,467 --> 00:42:31,522
Well, I'm not sure that it's what I want.
But I mean, nobody's offered me a job yet.

650
00:42:31,523 --> 00:42:34,260
Um, but when they do,
if they do, I suppose I could...

651
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:36,202
I could still always turn it down.

652
00:42:36,203 --> 00:42:37,592
I suppose so.

653
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:40,209
He wants me to get a haircut.

654
00:42:41,298 --> 00:42:45,173
Before the first interview. He says
he thinks it might be, uh, helpful.

655
00:42:45,174 --> 00:42:49,273
- Wow, are you actually going to do it?
- Yeah, I think he's probably right.

656
00:42:49,274 --> 00:42:51,714
Do you even know
where to get one, Daddy?

657
00:42:51,715 --> 00:42:52,815
Bridgette...

658
00:42:52,827 --> 00:42:55,227
For what it's worth,
I like the idea.

659
00:42:55,228 --> 00:42:57,065
