1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,600
NEXT TELLER PLEASE

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,350
I'm on a break.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,210
But we just opened.

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,460
Good morning.

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,860
Yes.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,190
M. Hitchens ?

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,820
Miss Boddicker, what is it now ?

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,150
I need to know if
you've contacted anyone.

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,010
I need to know if
you've called the police.

10
00:00:25,645 --> 00:00:27,540
Non, je n'ai contacé personne. I have not contacted anyone.

11
00:00:27,544 --> 00:00:29,335
No, I have not called the police.

12
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:30,369
But, M. Hitchens...

13
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:31,409
But, Melle Boddicker,

14
00:00:31,409 --> 00:00:33,193
what would you have me say to them ?

15
00:00:33,568 --> 00:00:35,021
"Hello, Police.

16
00:00:35,406 --> 00:00:38,313
"A woman who works in my bank"
is convinced it's going to be robbed.

17
00:00:38,486 --> 00:00:40,210
"She doesn't know exactly what day.

18
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:42,021
"She doesn't know exactly what time.

19
00:00:42,177 --> 00:00:43,992
"She won't tell me how she knows this.

20
00:00:43,998 --> 00:00:46,241
Just that the bank is going
to be robbed" ?

21
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:47,643
But it is !

22
00:00:47,657 --> 00:00:51,640
By two men in hockey masks
with shotguns.

23
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,543
Why won't you believe me ?

24
00:00:55,248 --> 00:00:58,143
Perhaps if you told me
how you came to know all of this...

25
00:00:58,155 --> 00:00:59,392
But I can't.

26
00:00:59,665 --> 00:01:01,102
Good-bye, Miss Boddicker.

27
00:01:01,118 --> 00:01:03,060
And yes, please close the door.

28
00:01:10,577 --> 00:01:11,791
All right.

29
00:01:12,797 --> 00:01:13,860
I'll tell you.

30
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:15,533
But you can't laugh.

31
00:01:15,707 --> 00:01:17,562
And you can't tell anyone else.

32
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:20,711
Very well, Miss Boddicker,
you have my word.

33
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,392
You have to swear.

34
00:01:24,757 --> 00:01:25,812
I swear.

35
00:01:26,145 --> 00:01:27,221
I won't laugh.

36
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:29,530
I won't tell anybody else.

37
00:01:33,215 --> 00:01:35,272
I saw it all in a dream.

38
00:01:37,317 --> 00:01:38,873
Excuse me ?

39
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:41,140
It came to me in a dream.

40
00:01:41,426 --> 00:01:42,842
Like that lady

41
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:44,973
the one that's always in the newspaper ?

42
00:01:45,128 --> 00:01:46,873
The one that's always in the news ?

43
00:01:47,518 --> 00:01:48,831
Allison Dubois ?

44
00:01:53,468 --> 00:01:54,763
That's not nice.

45
00:01:55,738 --> 00:01:56,963
You swore.

46
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:58,860
You're right.

47
00:01:59,268 --> 00:02:00,373
This will be better.

48
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:05,360
Now I get to call the police
and I get to tell them,

49
00:02:05,446 --> 00:02:08,743
"You've got to come down
to my branch right now

50
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:11,510
"and make sure no one
with a hockey mask

51
00:02:11,516 --> 00:02:14,103
"or a shotgun walks inside.

52
00:02:14,537 --> 00:02:17,002
"Of course I know it's
really going to happen.

53
00:02:17,268 --> 00:02:20,183
One of my tellers dreamed it."

54
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:23,800
Everybody down on the ground !

55
00:02:23,807 --> 00:02:25,463
Faces down ! Faces down !

56
00:02:25,477 --> 00:02:27,091
Behind the counter,
let me see your hands !

57
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:29,201
Come on, let me see those fingers.

58
00:02:32,476 --> 00:02:34,541
You, honey, fill that bag up.

59
00:02:35,107 --> 00:02:36,440
Or I'll blow his head off.

00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,660
Will you guys stop that ?

64
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,200
I'm trying to digest.

65
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:34,640
Come on, you're going
to miss Daddy too, aren't you ?

66
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,461
Of course, we'll miss Daddy,

67
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:38,671
but he'll be back Thursday night, right ?

68
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:39,952
Yeah.

69
00:03:40,007 --> 00:03:41,453
I leave on Tuesday morning,

70
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:42,810
I'm back on Thursday night.

71
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:45,582
I haven't even left yet,
and I'm almost home already.

72
00:03:45,587 --> 00:03:47,781
So can I get some kisses ?

73
00:03:48,198 --> 00:03:50,752
You... no wild parties
while I'm gone, okay ?

74
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:51,862
Okay.

75
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:00,731
So, Dad...

76
00:04:01,428 --> 00:04:02,423
Yeah.

77
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:04,321
I know that you're taking
a cab to the airport,

78
00:04:04,325 --> 00:04:07,143
and it seems kind of silly
that your car's just going to be

79
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:08,923
sitting in the garage while you're gone.

80
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:10,972
Where would you like it to sit ?

81
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:12,381
She'd like to sit in it.

82
00:04:12,536 --> 00:04:13,902
Preferably behind the wheel.

83
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:15,421
I mean, if you give me the keys,

84
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:18,110
I could help Mom and I could take
Bridgette and Marie to school

85
00:04:18,136 --> 00:04:19,602
and go to the market, and...

86
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:20,983
Ooh, that would be great.

87
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:27,002
Okay, you gave me something
to think about while I'm in San Diego,

88
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,261
so, yeah, I'll think about that.

89
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:29,692
Maybe next week, huh ?

90
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:32,032
Next week ?

91
00:04:37,828 --> 00:04:40,101
No joy riding. No friends in the car.

92
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:41,451
You take your sisters to school,

93
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:43,192
and you do anything else
that your mom might want, okay ?

94
00:04:43,197 --> 00:04:44,340
And that's it.

95
00:04:46,105 --> 00:04:47,352
That's it. I promise.

96
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:52,200
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

97
00:04:52,215 --> 00:04:54,000
- You be careful.
- Have a good trip.

98
00:04:57,635 --> 00:04:58,732
Will you walk me to the door ?

99
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:01,461
I get to pick the radio station.

100
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:03,003
Yeah, you get to pick your nose.

101
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,090
So how hard was that ?

102
00:05:05,177 --> 00:05:06,263
Really hard.

103
00:05:09,096 --> 00:05:10,600
Good morning. Dr. Atwell's office.

104
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:16,173
Hey. You made it.

105
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,850
Yeah. Yeah, well, uh...

106
00:05:23,426 --> 00:05:25,653
I don't know, it turns out
I was just down the block.

107
00:05:27,658 --> 00:05:28,720
I'm glad you're here.

108
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:30,542
Lynn ?

109
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:40,183
Lynn, hello.

110
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:44,882
Dr. Atwell, you've never met
the baby's father.

111
00:05:44,896 --> 00:05:46,212
This is Lee Scanlon.

112
00:05:46,615 --> 00:05:48,090
Lee, nice to meet you.

113
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:49,811
Congratulations.

114
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:51,670
So...

115
00:05:53,028 --> 00:05:54,113
20 weeks.

116
00:05:55,705 --> 00:05:56,802
First ultrasound.

117
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,883
So big question :

118
00:05:58,535 --> 00:05:59,991
Do we want to know the sex of the baby ?

119
00:05:59,995 --> 00:06:01,450
- Yes.
- No.

120
00:06:03,258 --> 00:06:04,442
I would.

121
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:10,990
Well, I have a waiting room
full of patients out there, folks.

122
00:06:11,898 --> 00:06:13,690
I mean, you two aren't married, are you ?

123
00:06:14,797 --> 00:06:19,652
So I really, I have to defer
to the mother.

124
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:21,260
And you should defer to the mother.

125
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:22,670
I'll just wait out in the hall.

126
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:24,022
Lee, don't.

127
00:06:24,037 --> 00:06:25,423
I won't.

128
00:06:28,308 --> 00:06:30,121
And if you're one of
those lucky commuters

129
00:06:30,137 --> 00:06:32,872
sitting in the middle of
Bell Road and getting nowhere fast,

130
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:36,741
you can thank two bank robbers who hit
a Maricopa National branch today

131
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:39,340
wearing hockey masks and
brandishing shotguns.

132
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:46,752
I mean if you're not responding
to a bank robbery,

133
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:47,981
what are you doing ?

134
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:56,172
Ruth Boddicker, right ?

135
00:07:00,016 --> 00:07:01,081
Ruth ?

136
00:07:02,727 --> 00:07:04,170
I think I know who you are.

137
00:07:04,827 --> 00:07:06,400
You're Allison Dubois, right ?

138
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:08,032
You're very perceptive.

139
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:09,191
No.

140
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:11,343
Um, just a bit of a news junkie.

141
00:07:11,357 --> 00:07:14,232
Oh, actually, I think you're more
perceptive than you let on.

142
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,511
Ruth, I had a dream
about you last night.

143
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:19,550
Me ?

144
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:22,725
In fact, my dream was about
a dream you had.

145
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:25,229
About this bank, about this robbery.

146
00:07:27,037 --> 00:07:29,039
Do you have any idea
what I'm talking about ?

147
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,192
No, not really.

148
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:33,300
Really ?
So you didn't dream about all this ?

149
00:07:33,308 --> 00:07:36,561
Try to warn your boss that
this robbery was going to happen ?

150
00:07:39,378 --> 00:07:42,351
Ruth, I know you've been through
an awful lot today.

151
00:07:43,117 --> 00:07:46,180
All kinds of people asking you
all kinds of questions

152
00:07:47,045 --> 00:07:51,393
but I have a funny feeling that you know
exactly what I'm talking about.

153
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:55,603
I also have a funny feeling
that as time goes on,

154
00:07:56,346 --> 00:07:58,573
you're going to really want
someone to talk to.

155
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:02,503
Here's my cell number.

156
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:05,440
Give me a call.

157
00:08:24,735 --> 00:08:26,322
Honey, I'm home.

158
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:28,731
So what's it like ?

159
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:30,600
Well, I can hear the ocean.

160
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,101
I can't see it, though.

161
00:08:32,117 --> 00:08:33,710
All I can see is the parking lot.

162
00:08:34,427 --> 00:08:36,212
And that's 'cause there's
a light out there.

163
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:37,912
I got off the plane,
I went right to work.

164
00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:41,183
By the time I got here,
it was dark, so I could be anywhere.

165
00:08:41,185 --> 00:08:42,581
You're very missed.

166
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:44,043
I very miss you.

167
00:08:44,495 --> 00:08:45,941
Well, you're very missed back.

168
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:48,353
Hey, honey, say hi to Daddy.

169
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:49,781
Hi, Dad.

170
00:08:52,485 --> 00:08:55,482
And how did my car survive
its first full day

171
00:08:55,488 --> 00:08:57,383
 with a 16-year-old behind the wheel ?

172
00:08:57,557 --> 00:08:59,250
Should I tell Daddy about the accident ?

173
00:08:59,265 --> 00:09:00,260
Mom !

174
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:01,753
He knows I'm kidding.

175
00:09:01,755 --> 00:09:02,850
You're kidding, right ?

TOP STORY "PSYCHIC"
PREDICTED BANK ROBBERY

177

Honey, honey, say hi to Daddy.

00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:13,600
...Ruth Boddicker, a long-time
employee of Maricopa National Bank

179
00:09:13,605 --> 00:09:17,003
actually predicted
this morning's daring bank heist.

180
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:18,733
According to the bank's manager,

181
00:09:18,736 --> 00:09:21,930
Boddicker repeatedly warned
that the robber was imminent.

182
00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:24,110
Is it true you predicted
today's robbery ?

183
00:09:24,537 --> 00:09:26,242
I really don't have anything to say.

184
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:27,812
I just want to get to my car.

185
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:29,723
- Hello ? Is anyone there ?
- God, poor woman.

186
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:31,423
I know exactly how she feels.

187
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:32,462
Allison ?

188
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:40,413
We made the TV news.

189
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,881
That's nice.

190
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:44,852
You know what they said ?

191
00:09:46,037 --> 00:09:49,121
Hopefully we got away clean
and they have no idea who we are.

192
00:09:50,317 --> 00:09:52,200
They did... they said that.

193
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:58,053
Then they said we got away
with 300 grand.

194
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:03,263
300 grand ?

195
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:08,033
That's insane.

196
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,340
There's a little over $32,000 here.

197
00:10:15,798 --> 00:10:17,242
You want to look again ?

198
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,283
What are you doing ?

199
00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:23,592
See, I was responsible
for checking the door

200
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,213
and watching the security guard.

201
00:10:26,148 --> 00:10:29,971
You were responsible
for taking care of the cash.

202
00:10:31,557 --> 00:10:33,812
I want to see the other $270,000.

203
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:37,322
I-I don't have it to show you.

204
00:10:39,027 --> 00:10:42,492
According to the news, you do.

205
00:10:42,506 --> 00:10:44,191
The news... they're wrong.

206
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:47,403
Look, maybe they put,
like, an extra zero on it

207
00:10:47,418 --> 00:10:49,521
or added a comma or something.

208
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:51,191
What ?

209
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,442
Will you...?

210
00:10:52,508 --> 00:10:54,472
You want left or right, hmm ?

211
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,571
It's your choice.

212
00:10:56,938 --> 00:10:58,280
Quit messing around.

213
00:10:58,887 --> 00:10:59,982
You're crazy.

214
00:11:01,096 --> 00:11:02,763
Stop. Don't do this.

215
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:08,551
Just take mine if you want. Don't !

216
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,410
Joe.

217
00:11:19,227 --> 00:11:20,223
Joe ?

218
00:11:20,545 --> 00:11:22,663
It's not Joe. It's Ruth.

219
00:11:22,676 --> 00:11:23,802
Ruth from the bank.

220
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:25,473
Ruth.

221
00:11:25,757 --> 00:11:27,803
I saw you on TV last night.

222
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:28,840
What time is it ?

223
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,620
It's, uh, a little after 6:00.

224
00:11:30,638 --> 00:11:33,613
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I needed to tell you.

225
00:11:34,136 --> 00:11:36,013
Everything you said to me
at the bank yesterday ?

226
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:37,390
It's true.

227
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:38,842
I do have dreams.

228
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,121
I did dream about that robbery.

229
00:11:41,136 --> 00:11:42,932
And I had another dream tonight.

230
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:44,483
Really ? Me, too. Just now.

231
00:11:44,526 --> 00:11:45,603
Then you saw it ?

232
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:47,362
The one robber killed the other ?

233
00:11:47,377 --> 00:11:48,990
Dumped his body in the park ?

234
00:11:49,095 --> 00:11:51,390
What ? No, no, no.
My dream didn't go that far.

235
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:54,413
Oh, Allison. It was horrible.

236
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:56,293
I kept hoping it wasn't true.

237
00:11:56,906 --> 00:11:59,052
Did you... did you see any landmarks,

238
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:00,262
maybe the name of the park ?

239
00:12:00,277 --> 00:12:02,480
I could send the police
there to look for the body.

240
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,973
You don't have to.
I already found it.

241
00:12:05,535 --> 00:12:09,333
In fact, I'm standing over it right now.

242
00:12:14,585 --> 00:12:16,070
Mommy had to go to work early,

243
00:12:16,187 --> 00:12:18,662
so I am driving you guys to school.

244
00:12:19,575 --> 00:12:21,280
Cool. I'm riding shotgun.

245
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:22,463
What's shotgun ?

246
00:12:23,527 --> 00:12:24,492
It's nothing.

247
00:12:24,507 --> 00:12:25,682
It's the, uh...

248
00:12:25,697 --> 00:12:28,751
empty seat beside the driver
that's going to stay empty

249
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:29,801
because Mom and Dad say

250
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:33,521
that you guys have to be
at least 12 years old to sit up there.

251
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:34,712
So ?

252
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:37,931
So, that means that
you can't sit up there.

253
00:12:39,338 --> 00:12:41,890
Wow, who died and
made you queen of Car-ville ?

254
00:12:49,498 --> 00:12:51,593
I've never been through
anything like this before.

255
00:12:54,057 --> 00:12:55,330
All this blood.

256
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:56,801
All this gore.

257
00:13:00,535 --> 00:13:01,771
I had that dream...

258
00:13:03,397 --> 00:13:05,222
and it was so vivid.

259
00:13:05,556 --> 00:13:08,452
And I thought, "Can this be true ?"

260
00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:11,851
And I looked up Hoskins Park
on the Internet,

261
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:13,730
and there was such a place.

262
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:16,261
So I got in my car
and I drove out here...

263
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:18,742
and there he was.

264
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:23,520
I've never seen a real,
live dead person before.

265
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:26,871
Allison.

266
00:13:26,876 --> 00:13:29,053
I take it this is the woman
you told me about,

267
00:13:29,056 --> 00:13:30,462
the woman who lead us here ?

268
00:13:30,475 --> 00:13:32,462
Ruth Boddicker. This is my boss,

269
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,390
District Attorney Manuel Devalos.

270
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:38,320
It's a great pleasure to meet you, sir.

271
00:13:38,336 --> 00:13:41,451
And you, Miss Boddicker. I read
about you in the papers this morning.

272
00:13:42,328 --> 00:13:45,561
Am I understanding correctly
that both of you had dreams

273
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:48,701
in which you saw the face
of whoever it was who killed this man ?

274
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:53,443
Well, then, not to take up
any more of your time,

275
00:13:53,456 --> 00:13:54,901
but it would be
extraordinarily helpful

276
00:13:54,915 --> 00:13:57,981
if I could get you together with
a detective to give him a description.

277
00:13:57,986 --> 00:13:59,243
We could run our composite software

278
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:01,120
and see if we could generate
a sketch of the killer.

279
00:14:02,436 --> 00:14:05,140
I guess I was hoping I would
show you where the dead body was

280
00:14:05,468 --> 00:14:06,972
and then that would be that.

281
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:11,060
Miss Boddicker, I can't
force you to give me a description.

282
00:14:11,076 --> 00:14:13,480
I can certainly
get one from Mrs. Dubois here,

283
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:17,340
but when it comes to identifying
criminals, the more input, the better.

284
00:14:17,586 --> 00:14:19,252
It would only take about 20 minutes.

285
00:14:20,195 --> 00:14:22,071
Actually, you might find it fun.

286
00:14:24,648 --> 00:14:25,731
All right, then.

287
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:28,383
I suppose.

288
00:14:29,596 --> 00:14:31,401
Wonderful, then,
we'll see you at City Hall.

289
00:14:31,418 --> 00:14:33,110
Third floor, anytime this afternoon.

290
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,632
I guess it's a date.

291
00:14:36,415 --> 00:14:37,512
Thank you.

292
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:41,562
Who'd have imagined ?

293
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:44,121
Two psychics, no waiting.
You want to get some breakfast ?

294
00:14:49,048 --> 00:14:51,710
Okay. Everybody in their car seats ?

295
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:53,663
Everybody wearing their seatbelts ?

296
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:56,912
Aye, aye, Captain Pushy.
Everyone's seated and strapped.

297
00:14:56,925 --> 00:14:58,690
Aye, aye, Captain Pushy.

298
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:01,602
What ?

299
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:03,602
Okay, you're supposed to be helping me.

300
00:15:03,846 --> 00:15:06,423
What do you want me to do ?
She's all buckled in.

301
00:15:06,976 --> 00:15:10,162
Hey, did you notice if I locked
the sliding glass door in the kitchen ?

302
00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:11,732
Why ? Was I supposed to ?

303
00:15:13,508 --> 00:15:14,473
Okay, you know what ?

304
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,392
If we're late,
I'm telling Mom that it was your fault.

305
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:22,412
She thinks she's so great,
just 'cause she can drive.

306
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:24,481
- Yeah.
- Well, I can drive, too, you know.

307
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:27,170
Remember the go-karts
we went on last summer ?

308
00:15:27,806 --> 00:15:28,523
No.

309
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:29,681
Well, I do.

310
00:15:31,255 --> 00:15:32,460
It's easy.

311
00:15:37,157 --> 00:15:39,880
Yeah, this is no big deal at all.

312
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,660
Watch. First thing you do
is you take this big stick thing.

313
00:15:44,317 --> 00:15:45,422
That was easy.

314
00:15:45,818 --> 00:15:49,103
Then you take this other stick
thing and you pull it over to "N."

315
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:51,400
That stands for "Now."

316
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:55,631
I don't see a stop button.

317
00:15:55,646 --> 00:15:57,190
Make it stop !

318
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,451
Oh, no, oh, no.

319
00:16:05,796 --> 00:16:07,192
This is bad.

320
00:16:07,797 --> 00:16:09,160
That was fun.

321
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:26,323
Lynn ?

322
00:16:31,648 --> 00:16:33,363
I don't get it.
You asked me to meet you for lunch.

323
00:16:33,378 --> 00:16:36,551
You, uh, give me an address
and it's a baby store.

324
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:39,773
I asked if you wanted
to meet at lunch, not for lunch.

325
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:41,210
I have to start ordering some things.

326
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:43,401
It could take three months
to get this stuff delivered.

327
00:16:44,228 --> 00:16:46,672
And I just felt funny picking
everything without you.

328
00:16:47,255 --> 00:16:48,721
Well, go ahead. Pick it without me.

329
00:16:48,728 --> 00:16:50,480
I mean, what you like, I like.

330
00:16:50,495 --> 00:16:52,232
It's not like I'm going
to be sleeping in it.

331
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:54,400
I know you care.

332
00:16:54,418 --> 00:16:56,101
I know deep down,
you care about all of it.

333
00:16:56,338 --> 00:16:57,553
You're not fooling me.

334
00:16:58,486 --> 00:16:59,713
Whatever you say.

335
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:02,973
You want to hear the name
I'm thinking about ?

336
00:17:03,978 --> 00:17:06,142
No. You tell me the name,
I'm going to know the sex.

337
00:17:06,537 --> 00:17:07,530
Lee.

338
00:17:07,908 --> 00:17:08,633
Yeah ?

339
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:10,651
No, that's the name. Lee.

340
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,232
Lee, Lee, Lee.

341
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:15,111
It works for a girl
and it works for a boy. Lee.

342
00:17:16,288 --> 00:17:17,552
Don't do this.

343
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:19,010
But I love the name Lee.

344
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:20,083
I do.

345
00:17:23,378 --> 00:17:25,010
Look, whatever you buy is fine.

346
00:17:28,425 --> 00:17:29,431
See you at home.

347
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,531
<i>Do you exchange foreign money ?</i>

348
00:18:00,008 --> 00:18:01,000
Excuse me ?

349
00:18:01,005 --> 00:18:03,701
You know, I got about
500 Mexican pesos here,

350
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,202
and I was just wondering if
I could swap it for American money.

351
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:08,713
Sure. I can do that.

352
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:10,511
All right.

353
00:18:12,188 --> 00:18:14,701
Hey. You tango ?

354
00:18:16,408 --> 00:18:17,551
Is it Ruth ?

355
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:20,373
Well, it's a small world.

356
00:18:20,387 --> 00:18:22,950
I just got back from Mexico
on a tango weekend.

357
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:24,322
I'm really a beginner.

358
00:18:25,617 --> 00:18:27,013
I take lessons.

359
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,312
Oh. That's my teacher.

360
00:18:30,665 --> 00:18:33,333
I dance over at the Shirley Karch
Studio on Wednesday nights.

361
00:18:33,986 --> 00:18:36,300
It's fun there.
I mean, you meet people.

362
00:18:37,186 --> 00:18:38,542
Maybe you should try it.

363
00:18:39,437 --> 00:18:41,220
Well, I don't know if
I'm ready for that.

364
00:18:41,896 --> 00:18:43,090
You look ready to me.

365
00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:53,331
So... That comes to $32.33.

366
00:18:55,665 --> 00:18:58,080
All right. Thank you.

367
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:01,413
And I'll be looking
for you at the Shirley Karch Studios.

368
00:19:02,277 --> 00:19:03,680
Take it easy, Ruth.

369
00:19:08,537 --> 00:19:09,762
Yeah. Come in.

370
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:15,751
Hi. Hope I'm not interrupting anything.

371
00:19:17,245 --> 00:19:19,342
Just gave the detectives my description.

372
00:19:19,716 --> 00:19:20,840
Of course.

373
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,373
You were right.

374
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:24,180
It was kind of fun.

375
00:19:25,726 --> 00:19:27,152
They said any time you were ready.

376
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:30,102
Well, thank you. I'll be over soon.

377
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:35,893
So, listen. I hope I didn't
get you into any trouble this morning.

378
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:37,732
Excuse me ?

379
00:19:37,906 --> 00:19:40,461
Uh, I know you're
the big psychic around here,

380
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:44,780
and then here I go finding
the body and everything.

381
00:19:45,187 --> 00:19:46,921
I hope I didn't make you look bad.

382
00:19:48,308 --> 00:19:49,400
Don't worry, Ruth.

383
00:19:49,418 --> 00:19:51,192
You're just keeping me on my toes.

384
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:52,210
Okay, then.

385
00:19:52,318 --> 00:19:54,850
Guess if I have any more dreams,
I'll just call you.

386
00:19:55,217 --> 00:19:56,520
Well, I'll be waiting.

387
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:00,863
Oh! Oh, Ruth. The dead man.

388
00:20:01,446 --> 00:20:03,273
Jimmy... Jimmy Fleming.

389
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:06,340
Are you sure you've never
met him before ?

390
00:20:08,218 --> 00:20:09,503
I don't think so.

391
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:10,803
Maybe at the bank.

392
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:13,903
He might have mentioned
a mutual interest in tango lessons ?

393
00:20:21,238 --> 00:20:22,711
Oh, my goodness.

394
00:20:23,198 --> 00:20:24,161
Yes.

395
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:26,113
Of course I remember him now.

396
00:20:27,006 --> 00:20:30,673
But that would mean he was one
of the men who robbed the bank.

397
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:32,930
Pointed a gun at me.

398
00:20:34,536 --> 00:20:35,961
That nice man.

399
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:40,461
Did this just come to you ?

400
00:20:41,578 --> 00:20:43,711
God, you're good at this.

401
00:20:45,238 --> 00:20:47,020
How come we didn't realize it sooner ?

402
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,423
So many people come into the bank.

403
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:55,592
Oh, I'm so sorry. It's my daughter.

404
00:20:56,608 --> 00:20:57,550
Don't worry.

405
00:20:57,555 --> 00:20:59,501
Allison, I have your number.

406
00:20:59,776 --> 00:21:02,882
If I have any more important dreams,
I'll just call you.

407
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:04,001
Thank you.

408
00:21:07,408 --> 00:21:08,572
Hello ? Hey, sweetie.

409
00:21:08,586 --> 00:21:10,462
Everybody home safe and sound ?

410
00:21:11,225 --> 00:21:13,302
Yeah. Everyone's home from school.

411
00:21:13,308 --> 00:21:14,680
Safe and sound.

412
00:21:14,926 --> 00:21:17,961
But Bridgette has something
that she wants to tell you.

413
00:21:21,795 --> 00:21:23,103
Do you love me, Mommy ?

414
00:21:26,638 --> 00:21:28,653
I'm sorry. I don't think
I heard you correctly.

415
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:31,382
I said something happened to your car.

416
00:21:31,396 --> 00:21:32,732
It's nothing major.

417
00:21:33,198 --> 00:21:36,330
It's just the back fender...
it's a little scrunched.

418
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,662
But the kids are okay.

419
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:40,301
Everybody's okay. Nobody got hurt.

420
00:21:40,885 --> 00:21:42,331
And please don't get mad at Ariel.

421
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:45,201
It was actually Bridgette who was
behind the wheel when it happened.

422
00:21:46,866 --> 00:21:48,810
How is that even possible ?

423
00:21:49,028 --> 00:21:50,090
You know what...

424
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:53,310
I don't want to talk about this.
I'm exhausted from this whole thing.

425
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,681
I finally got the girls to go to bed.

426
00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:56,720
It's the bumper, the fender,

427
00:21:56,735 --> 00:21:58,160
whatever that thing is in the back.

428
00:21:58,177 --> 00:21:59,392
We'll get it fixed.

429
00:22:00,656 --> 00:22:02,750
Where were you, uh, you know,
when all this happened ?

430
00:22:02,765 --> 00:22:04,313
What does that have to do with anything ?

431
00:22:04,317 --> 00:22:05,742
What, now you're taking offense ?

432
00:22:06,238 --> 00:22:07,801
Look, Allison, you just told me that

433
00:22:07,807 --> 00:22:09,483
my car rolled backwards down
the driveway

434
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:11,951
with our 11-year-old daughter
behind the wheel.

435
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:14,953
And I don't have the right to ask
where you were in relation to all this ?

436
00:22:14,956 --> 00:22:16,841
Well, I was a hell of
a lot closer than you were.

437
00:22:16,855 --> 00:22:17,851
I was at work.

438
00:22:18,597 --> 00:22:19,612
Yeah, I knew that.

439
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:20,742
Your point being ?

440
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:22,793
Hey, I don't know what the point is,
Allison.

441
00:22:22,848 --> 00:22:24,722
But this is not what I wanted to hear.

442
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:27,421
I don't know what to tell you.
Turn on the radio.

443
00:22:37,505 --> 00:22:39,573
So other than that, how is everything ?

444
00:22:49,987 --> 00:22:51,072
Come on.

445
00:22:51,928 --> 00:22:53,482
You can do this.

446
00:22:57,257 --> 00:22:59,581
Just go in there, say hi.

447
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:03,541
Nothing's going to happen if
you just sit here in your car.

448
00:23:24,597 --> 00:23:25,602
Uh-uh, Ruth.

449
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:30,311
Life hands you lemons...
you go get a lemonade.

450
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:32,500
Or maybe a whiskey sour.

451
00:24:00,986 --> 00:24:02,543
To future business ventures.

452
00:24:08,516 --> 00:24:09,950
So...

453
00:24:11,645 --> 00:24:15,212
I want to show you these. Huh ?

454
00:24:17,787 --> 00:24:18,880
You're serious.

455
00:24:19,495 --> 00:24:20,501
Hockey masks ?

456
00:24:20,756 --> 00:24:21,781
I'm telling you,

457
00:24:22,556 --> 00:24:24,490
it's like they were made
for this kind of work.

458
00:24:24,905 --> 00:24:27,970
It's a bank robbery, not a horror film.

459
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:31,400
Oh, lighten up, nobody can hear me.

460
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:35,991
I even know which teller
I'm going to hit.

461
00:24:36,687 --> 00:24:38,101
This little Miss Lonely Hearts...

462
00:24:38,106 --> 00:24:41,500
always making goo-goo eyes
at me every time I come there.

463
00:24:49,216 --> 00:24:50,071
Sir.

464
00:24:51,688 --> 00:24:53,671
I think Ruth Boddicker's
been lying to us.

465
00:24:54,716 --> 00:24:56,371
Well, good morning to you, too.

466
00:24:56,388 --> 00:24:57,891
Sir, I'm serious.

467
00:24:58,107 --> 00:25:00,461
I don't think she knew about that
bank robbery 'cause she dreamt it.

468
00:25:00,476 --> 00:25:01,893
I think she knew about
that bank robbery

469
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:03,983
'cause she was sweet on
one of the robbers

470
00:25:03,987 --> 00:25:05,312
and she overheard it.

471
00:25:05,906 --> 00:25:08,620
Then how do you explain her
ability to find that body yesterday ?

472
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:10,171
Are you telling me
she didn't dream that either ?

473
00:25:10,186 --> 00:25:12,352
I don't know the answer to that,
sir. Not yet.

474
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,651
I'll tell you what,
why don't we ask her ?

475
00:25:17,026 --> 00:25:20,223
I called her and asked her if
she could stop by on her way to work.

476
00:25:20,826 --> 00:25:22,413
And here she is now.

477
00:25:26,807 --> 00:25:29,173
Ladies, I have a bit of a problem

478
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:30,803
and I'd like to share it with you.

479
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:33,232
Yesterday you both sat down
with detectives

480
00:25:33,235 --> 00:25:35,401
and gave descriptions of the man

481
00:25:35,415 --> 00:25:38,310
you believed was responsible
for the killing of Jimmy Fleming...

482
00:25:38,338 --> 00:25:41,773
one of the two men suspected in the
robbery of the Maricopa National Bank.

483
00:25:42,005 --> 00:25:46,643
Now based on the separate
descriptions you gave,

484
00:25:46,677 --> 00:25:49,021
here are the composite sketches
they've come up with.

485
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,451
Well, that can't be.

486
00:25:51,776 --> 00:25:53,902
Actually, it's perfect.

487
00:25:54,628 --> 00:25:56,162
That's exactly what he looks like.

488
00:25:56,177 --> 00:25:57,262
No, no, no. No, no.

489
00:25:57,265 --> 00:25:59,322
I have to say something.
Ruth, you know

490
00:25:59,338 --> 00:26:01,481
this looks nothing like
the man we're looking for.

491
00:26:01,495 --> 00:26:03,063
He looks like it to me.

492
00:26:03,157 --> 00:26:04,353
In my dream, he looks just like that.

493
00:26:04,357 --> 00:26:06,283
In your dream ?
Did you even have a dream ?

494
00:26:07,307 --> 00:26:08,830
Are you mad at me ?

495
00:26:09,545 --> 00:26:11,121
What are you talking about ?

496
00:26:11,617 --> 00:26:12,522
Is this because

497
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:15,231
 I had a dream that led us to the body
yesterday and you didn't ?

498
00:26:15,286 --> 00:26:16,702
- Of course not.
- Ladies...

499
00:26:16,706 --> 00:26:19,703
Because I would never do
anything to knowingly upset you.

500
00:26:21,466 --> 00:26:22,940
But I can't lie.

501
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:30,040
This is the man who killed
the man we found in that park.

502
00:26:30,185 --> 00:26:31,212
He just is.

503
00:26:32,355 --> 00:26:34,910
And-and this man ?
You don't recognize him at all ?

504
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:36,383
You've never seen him before ?

505
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:37,393
Not in a bar

506
00:26:37,487 --> 00:26:39,393
talking with the man that
we found dead yesterday ?

507
00:26:39,408 --> 00:26:41,331
Talking about robbing a bank ?

508
00:26:41,535 --> 00:26:43,892
Listening while his partner bragged

509
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:46,233
about you making goo-goo eyes at him ?

510
00:26:49,298 --> 00:26:50,703
Goo-goo eyes ?

511
00:26:52,036 --> 00:26:54,273
You don't have to be cruel, Mrs. Dubois.

512
00:26:55,686 --> 00:26:59,341
I think I would remember if someone
made a comment like that about me.

513
00:27:01,556 --> 00:27:04,020
In fact, I'm certain
that I will always remember

514
00:27:04,348 --> 00:27:07,220
what you just said to me, here, now.

515
00:27:09,716 --> 00:27:11,261
I have to get to work.

516
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:13,540
May I go now ?

517
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:14,623
Of course.

518
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:25,862
Don't rush off.

519
00:27:27,027 --> 00:27:28,921
I've been waiting for you
to get up and come out here.

520
00:27:28,997 --> 00:27:30,810
You're always asleep
by the time I get home.

521
00:27:31,686 --> 00:27:33,020
You've been getting home so late.

522
00:27:33,636 --> 00:27:35,340
I figured that was
the way you wanted it.

523
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,240
Here's the thing.

524
00:27:46,256 --> 00:27:49,120
I'm actually really excited
about all of it...

525
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:53,373
you, the baby.

526
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:55,861
I am.

527
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:00,481
I know it doesn't show.

528
00:28:01,657 --> 00:28:02,982
I know it's hard to tell.

529
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:15,563
I think I'm scared I might
not be very good at it.

530
00:28:21,676 --> 00:28:26,443
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I'm terrified.

531
00:28:48,947 --> 00:28:50,900
Girls tried to stay up.

532
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:53,673
I'm sorry I'm so late.

533
00:28:55,095 --> 00:28:56,932
It's not your fault the plane was late.

534
00:28:57,018 --> 00:28:59,010
Oh, it's so good to be home.

535
00:29:03,596 --> 00:29:04,490
What is this ?

536
00:29:05,617 --> 00:29:06,961
It's from Bridgette.

537
00:29:07,218 --> 00:29:08,700
She offered to skip going to college

538
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:11,602
so she could get a job and
pay for that dent in your Jeep.

539
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:14,822
She's half yours.

540
00:29:31,165 --> 00:29:32,061
Hello.

541
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:35,091
- Ruth Boddicker.
- Speaking.

542
00:29:35,426 --> 00:29:37,010
Just saw you on the news.

543
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:39,631
So you knew we were coming, huh ?

544
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,491
May I ask who's calling please ?

545
00:29:44,106 --> 00:29:46,180
We met earlier today at the bank.

546
00:29:46,455 --> 00:29:51,152
I was wearing a hockey mask
and carrying a big gun.

547
00:29:53,777 --> 00:29:55,331
Where's the rest of my money, Ruth ?

548
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:57,911
They said we got away with $300,000,

549
00:29:57,927 --> 00:30:01,043
but you and I both know it was $30,000.

550
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:03,011
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

551
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,110
Where's my money, Ruth ?

552
00:30:16,365 --> 00:30:18,053
You safe in your house now ?

553
00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:21,221
All alone ?

554
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:24,750
Just you and my money ?

555
00:30:27,196 --> 00:30:28,441
Think again.

556
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:41,370
I don't think Mom's even up yet.

557
00:30:41,898 --> 00:30:45,142
And that means that we can have
whatever we want for breakfast.

558
00:30:45,155 --> 00:30:46,650
Even candy ?

559
00:30:46,856 --> 00:30:48,331
Definitely candy.

560
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,503
Just who I've been waiting for.

561
00:30:58,916 --> 00:30:59,993
Where's Mom ?

562
00:31:00,468 --> 00:31:02,870
Mom had to go somewhere
very early this morning.

563
00:31:02,885 --> 00:31:04,930
So it's just you and me, kid.

564
00:31:05,526 --> 00:31:07,093
I'm going back to bed.

565
00:31:10,505 --> 00:31:12,321
Why don't you come over here
and have a seat.

566
00:31:13,198 --> 00:31:14,341
Am I in big trouble ?

567
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:16,370
Pretty big.

568
00:31:19,617 --> 00:31:21,863
Ruth, those men robbed the bank,

569
00:31:22,646 --> 00:31:24,663
but you kept most of the money,
didn't you ?

570
00:31:25,037 --> 00:31:27,102
That's why you gave us
that phony description of the robber...

571
00:31:27,107 --> 00:31:28,821
the one who killed his partner.

572
00:31:28,856 --> 00:31:31,671
'Cause he's the only other
person who knows what you did.

573
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:35,040
Ruth, you knew the body
was going to be in the park

574
00:31:35,045 --> 00:31:36,471
'cause you brought it there.

575
00:31:36,488 --> 00:31:37,661
No.

576
00:31:38,156 --> 00:31:39,573
I dreamt about that body.

577
00:31:40,085 --> 00:31:41,590
I dreamt about that robbery.

578
00:31:41,957 --> 00:31:43,892
And I don't know anything
about any money.

579
00:31:44,257 --> 00:31:45,720
I'm sorry.

580
00:31:45,955 --> 00:31:47,440
I can't talk with you anymore.

581
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:48,900
My shift's about to begin.

582
00:31:50,097 --> 00:31:52,372
I really do hope
you'll solve this case.

583
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:01,622
Can I help you ?

584
00:32:01,815 --> 00:32:03,201
Yeah, I wanted to pay a visit.

585
00:32:03,438 --> 00:32:05,173
Your name ? Last name first.

586
00:32:05,737 --> 00:32:08,343
Scanlon, Lee.

587
00:32:10,225 --> 00:32:11,580
And who do you wish to see ?

588
00:32:11,588 --> 00:32:13,870
Scanlon, Lee.

589
00:32:13,918 --> 00:32:14,991
Senior.

590
00:32:23,847 --> 00:32:25,612
Hey, Pop, it's Lee.

591
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:41,402
You feeling all right ?

592
00:32:51,815 --> 00:32:53,813
So, that girl I told you about...

593
00:32:57,186 --> 00:32:58,401
we're having a baby.

594
00:33:03,707 --> 00:33:05,301
And I will never hit it.

595
00:33:10,826 --> 00:33:12,493
I know I got your stuff...

596
00:33:13,275 --> 00:33:15,083
your DNA inside me.

597
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:22,852
But I will never hit it.

598
00:33:26,586 --> 00:33:27,353
There.

599
00:33:27,355 --> 00:33:30,183
As soon as she starts putting the money
into the bag the robbers gave her,

600
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:32,192
she turns her back to the camera.

601
00:33:32,805 --> 00:33:33,881
Okay ?

602
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:36,553
Well, she did that on purpose.
She didn't want anyone to see

603
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,532
her load the robbers' bag
with the smaller bills

604
00:33:38,537 --> 00:33:40,423
while she put the bigger bills in hers.

605
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,673
Well, that's an interesting theory,
Allison,

606
00:33:42,675 --> 00:33:45,061
but I don't actually see it.

607
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:46,553
Well, I see it.

608
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:49,833
Allison, no judge is going
to issue a warrant

609
00:33:49,837 --> 00:33:53,192
because someone being held at gunpoint
just happens to turn their back

610
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,293
to a security camera during a robbery.

611
00:33:55,537 --> 00:33:56,761
Sir, we have to get ahead of this guy.

612
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:58,011
We have to confront Ruth,

613
00:33:58,025 --> 00:33:59,262
get her to give that money back

614
00:33:59,276 --> 00:34:01,021
or this man's gonna kill her for it.

615
00:34:01,357 --> 00:34:02,891
You may very well be right,

616
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:05,050
but, uh, this office isn't set up

617
00:34:05,066 --> 00:34:07,141
to protect one criminal from another.

618
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,600
And if she is
an innocent victim in all this,

619
00:34:09,617 --> 00:34:12,302
if he really is pursuing
and threatening her,

620
00:34:12,737 --> 00:34:14,933
then she needs to come
in this office and file a complaint.

621
00:34:14,948 --> 00:34:16,533
But until she does that...

622
00:34:18,477 --> 00:34:19,432
Anything else ?

623
00:34:20,796 --> 00:34:21,852
I guess not.

624
00:34:39,216 --> 00:34:40,140
You bring it ?

625
00:34:41,886 --> 00:34:43,663
$135,000.

626
00:34:44,005 --> 00:34:44,922
Your half.

627
00:34:45,727 --> 00:34:47,001
Just like we agreed on.

628
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:50,101
The same exact amount you would've
had when you left the bank.

629
00:35:05,285 --> 00:35:06,371
Yeah...

630
00:35:12,205 --> 00:35:13,833
Now, tell me where the rest of it is.

631
00:35:14,135 --> 00:35:15,472
But we had a deal.

632
00:35:15,998 --> 00:35:17,720
"Had." Yeah.

633
00:35:19,865 --> 00:35:20,782
I have it.

634
00:35:21,398 --> 00:35:22,440
It's with me.

635
00:35:22,868 --> 00:35:24,901
You broke into my house,
I couldn't leave it there.

636
00:35:25,727 --> 00:35:27,550
Um, it's in the trunk.

637
00:35:28,557 --> 00:35:29,680
Keys.

638
00:35:33,585 --> 00:35:34,733
All right.

639
00:35:50,785 --> 00:35:51,863
I don't see it.

640
00:35:57,228 --> 00:35:59,590
Now, you give me your car keys.

641
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,480
You can bite me, old lady.

642
00:36:01,815 --> 00:36:03,191
You ain't gonna pull that trigger.

643
00:36:04,907 --> 00:36:06,020
I'll do it !

644
00:36:06,705 --> 00:36:07,770
Keys !

645
00:36:08,508 --> 00:36:09,773
All right.

646
00:36:31,975 --> 00:36:33,781
Is somebody actually at the door ?

647
00:36:34,215 --> 00:36:35,632
What the hell time is it ?

648
00:36:36,118 --> 00:36:37,452
It's a little after 2:00.

649
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:46,440
I took a killer's car,

650
00:36:46,678 --> 00:36:48,390
I took a killer's gun,

651
00:36:49,518 --> 00:36:51,791
and I took the money from the bank.

652
00:36:52,207 --> 00:36:53,432
Help.

653
00:37:00,138 --> 00:37:00,942
***Earl Crogetch***

654
00:37:01,126 --> 00:37:02,773
I'm District Attorney Manuel Devalos.

655
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:04,861
I'm sorry to disturb you
so early in the morning.

656
00:37:05,277 --> 00:37:08,262
You, uh, you look like
you've had a rough night.

657
00:37:08,718 --> 00:37:10,753
Yeah, I actually just got in.

658
00:37:11,557 --> 00:37:13,321
Had myself a rather long walk.

659
00:37:13,325 --> 00:37:16,272
What, um, what can I do for you ?

660
00:37:16,766 --> 00:37:20,302
Well, I'm here to inform you that you
are officially a suspect in a robbery

661
00:37:20,308 --> 00:37:22,900
that took place several days ago
at the Maricopa National Bank.

662
00:37:23,005 --> 00:37:23,903
Really ?

663
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,940
Truly.

664
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,763
In fact, I'm in possession
of a warrant authorizing me

665
00:37:27,776 --> 00:37:29,333
to search your vehicle for stolen money

666
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,063
and a possible murder weapon.

667
00:37:31,455 --> 00:37:32,342
My vehicle ?

668
00:37:33,558 --> 00:37:34,343
Well...

669
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:35,941
looks like you're out of luck there,

670
00:37:35,957 --> 00:37:38,793
Mr. District Attorney.

671
00:37:39,636 --> 00:37:41,601
'Cause my vehicle was recently stolen.

672
00:37:41,868 --> 00:37:43,142
Are you certain about that, sir ?

673
00:37:44,868 --> 00:37:48,380
Because I do believe that
this car in the driveway is, uh,

674
00:37:48,395 --> 00:37:49,722
registered in your name.

675
00:37:50,825 --> 00:37:52,630
By the way,
you left the keys in the ignition.

676
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:54,263
Not a smart thing to do
in this neighborhood.

677
00:37:54,368 --> 00:37:56,231
Here's the search warrant
I was telling you about.

678
00:37:57,986 --> 00:37:58,940
Okay.

679
00:38:10,218 --> 00:38:11,392
There's nothing in there.

680
00:38:19,218 --> 00:38:20,912
No, no, no, this is a setup.

681
00:38:20,927 --> 00:38:22,012
I didn't put that there.

682
00:38:22,275 --> 00:38:23,210
This is her.

683
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:25,593
She took... She...

684
00:38:26,248 --> 00:38:27,653
She took that money !

685
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,000
She planted it in my car !

686
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:32,223
She stole my car ;
she planted it in there !

687
00:38:32,818 --> 00:38:33,990
I'm sorry, who are we talking about ?

688
00:38:33,996 --> 00:38:35,620
The crazy lady from the news.

689
00:38:35,638 --> 00:38:37,060
Th-The bank teller.

690
00:38:37,076 --> 00:38:38,593
The one that thinks she's a psychic.

691
00:38:38,645 --> 00:38:39,760
But she is psychic.

692
00:38:40,337 --> 00:38:41,532
It was her dreams that led us here.

693
00:38:41,538 --> 00:38:43,583
She was the one who told me about
the car in the driveway.

694
00:38:43,695 --> 00:38:45,660
She was the one who told me
about the money in the trunk.

695
00:38:45,676 --> 00:38:48,700
And she's even the one
who told me this is where you lived.

696
00:38:49,128 --> 00:38:52,300
So, and there was one other thing...

697
00:38:53,827 --> 00:38:54,803
Oh, yeah.

698
00:38:57,226 --> 00:38:58,991
She told me to look
in the glove compartment.

699
00:39:02,405 --> 00:39:03,360
For a gun.

700
00:39:05,108 --> 00:39:06,443
So, now the only question is :

701
00:39:06,456 --> 00:39:08,123
Will the ballistics report on this gun

702
00:39:08,135 --> 00:39:11,050
match the bullet holes
in the body of your friend

703
00:39:11,066 --> 00:39:12,990
and accomplice, Jimmy Fleming ?

704
00:39:29,005 --> 00:39:30,280
You look pleased about something.

705
00:39:30,295 --> 00:39:31,502
Is it me or the box ?

706
00:39:32,718 --> 00:39:33,871
I don't know yet.

707
00:39:33,927 --> 00:39:35,340
Let's see what's inside.

708
00:39:41,997 --> 00:39:43,292
I called the doctor.

709
00:39:44,276 --> 00:39:45,590
Found out it's a girl.

710
00:39:47,678 --> 00:39:48,802
I like it.

711
00:39:48,897 --> 00:39:50,190
Girl named Lee.

712
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:53,770
A whole new thing.

713
00:39:56,596 --> 00:39:57,763
Come here, you.

714
00:40:08,137 --> 00:40:09,602
Morning, Miss Boddicker.

715
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:12,200
FIRST ONE HERE AS USUAL.

716
00:40:13,888 --> 00:40:15,841
25 years is a long time.

717
00:40:16,095 --> 00:40:17,310
You develop habits.

718
00:40:18,027 --> 00:40:19,973
You know,
I was just sitting in my office,

719
00:40:19,976 --> 00:40:23,243
thinking about how you came
to me with your dreams

720
00:40:23,615 --> 00:40:25,461
and how I didn't listen.

721
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:27,002
Oh, that's okay.

722
00:40:27,818 --> 00:40:29,300
Everything worked out, didn't it ?

723
00:40:29,986 --> 00:40:31,683
I mean, the bank got its money back

724
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:34,502
and I'm still here.

725
00:40:35,928 --> 00:40:38,052
Still, I wish I had listened.

726
00:40:38,707 --> 00:40:40,491
And I was nicer.

727
00:40:42,916 --> 00:40:46,123
If you have any more dreams
you care to talk about,

728
00:40:46,135 --> 00:40:48,511
I hope you won't hesitate.

729
00:40:49,637 --> 00:40:55,681
Actually, I haven't been
dreaming much lately, Mr. Hitchens.

730
00:40:56,025 --> 00:40:57,951
Whatever it was that made me dream,

731
00:40:58,877 --> 00:41:00,660
I think it went away.

732
00:41:08,808 --> 00:41:10,902
Actually, I had a dream last night.

733
00:41:13,856 --> 00:41:15,572
Ask me what it was.

734
00:41:16,918 --> 00:41:18,512
All right, Mr. Hitchens.

735
00:41:18,526 --> 00:41:19,800
What did you dream ?

736
00:41:20,325 --> 00:41:22,591
I'll tell you but you can't laugh.

737
00:41:22,668 --> 00:41:24,453
And you can't tell anyone else.

738
00:41:24,907 --> 00:41:26,072
Very well, Mr. Hitchens.

739
00:41:26,078 --> 00:41:27,360
You have my word.

740
00:41:28,707 --> 00:41:29,800
You have to swear.

741
00:41:31,078 --> 00:41:33,791
All right, I swear.

742
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:36,990
I won't laugh and
I won't tell  anyone else.

743
00:41:39,926 --> 00:41:42,951
I was dancing the tango.

744
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:44,801
With you.

745
00:41:55,756 --> 00:41:57,141
Very nice dream.

746
00:41:59,645 --> 00:42:01,143
Ask me when it happens.

747
00:42:04,015 --> 00:42:05,251
When does it happen ?

748
00:42:06,235 --> 00:42:07,893
Tonight, I hope.

749
00:42:10,665 --> 00:42:13,612
I hope you'll come by
my office to discuss it later.

750
00:42:14,395 --> 00:42:16,130
Yes, sir, Mr. Hitchens.

751
00:42:22,185 --> 00:42:25,363
