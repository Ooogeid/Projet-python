00:00:01,324 --> 00:00:03,324
<i>Divorce lawyers like to say...</i>

2
00:00:03,532 --> 00:00:06,948
<i>that "love" is the ultimate
unenforceable contract.</i>

3
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:11,008
<i>It is always being
re-negotiated by time.</i>

4
00:00:13,694 --> 00:00:16,390
<i>Whether it's the love of
a husband for his wife...</i>

5
00:00:17,316 --> 00:00:19,116
<i>or a parent for a child...</i>

6
00:00:20,698 --> 00:00:23,356
<i>... or even a lover
for their sweetheart...</i>

7
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,004
<i>the day invariably arises
when the contract,</i>

8
00:00:26,182 --> 00:00:30,186
<i>the agreements and understanding
that define a relationship, change.</i>

9
00:00:33,092 --> 00:00:36,942
<i>The function of time, familiarity
or sometimes just Mother Nature.</i>

10
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, well, if it isn't our own
Deputy Doll. Back for another test?

11
00:00:43,987 --> 00:00:45,310
The last one was defective.

12
00:00:45,435 --> 00:00:48,547
The plus sign looks more like a division
symbol, so I remain unconvinced.

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,877
Third test today, Mama Bear.

14
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:58,057
Your Eggo is preggo,
no doubt about it.

15
00:00:58,656 --> 00:01:00,056
Silencio, old man.

16
00:01:00,862 --> 00:01:02,672
You pay for that pee stick
when you're done.

17
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:05,856
Don't think it's yours just
'cause you marked it with your urine.

www.sub-way.fr
www.seriessub.com

19
00:01:58,548 --> 00:02:01,297
But I don't get it. Why do I have
to go to the doctor's office

20
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:02,788
when I don't feel sick?

21
00:02:03,234 --> 00:02:06,054
'Cause Mommy's working again
and Daddy's working again,

22
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:08,252
which means
we have our insurance back.

23
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:10,791
- So?
- So, that means that

24
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:13,340
we can go to the doctor,
and somebody else will pay for it.

25
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,923
Well, tell them to save their money.
We're not interested.

26
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:18,622
We're all going to do it.

27
00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:20,826
Mommy's going to go see her doctor.

28
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:23,751
Daddy's going to see
his doctor this morning.

29
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,258
Everybody's going to get a checkup.

30
00:02:26,553 --> 00:02:27,855
Uh-oh, this isn't good.

31
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,022
When they say "checkup,"

32
00:02:30,147 --> 00:02:31,837
they mean shots.

33
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:35,312
I don't want no, no shot.

34
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:38,107
Hey now, just 'cause
you're going to the doctor

35
00:02:38,232 --> 00:02:40,367
for a checkup doesn't mean
you're going to get shots.

36
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:42,272
Right. And fish can't swim.

37
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:43,897
I don't want a shot!

38
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,291
Look at your sister, honey.
You're getting her all upset.

39
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:49,042
Hey, I got an idea.

40
00:02:49,342 --> 00:02:50,342
What if...

41
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:54,006
we go to the doctor's office,
and, well...

42
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:55,617
we get the shots,

43
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:59,093
and then, afterwards,
we go to the toy store

44
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:02,640
and you guys let us pick out
whatever we want?

45
00:03:03,508 --> 00:03:04,308
What?

46
00:03:04,675 --> 00:03:07,603
- Wait a second, where did you get that?
- They do it on television.

47
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,523
Actually, I've seen it a lot.

48
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,526
Well, I'm not interested in
talking about television, honey.

49
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,489
- I gotta go to my doctor's appointment.
- Us, too.

50
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:20,699
Us, too.

51
00:03:24,388 --> 00:03:26,188
Got a minute for a friend?

52
00:03:27,198 --> 00:03:29,019
- Councilman Leaming...
- Don't fire anyone.

53
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:30,811
I told them not to announce me.

54
00:03:31,093 --> 00:03:34,362
- I'm here on unofficial business.
- Then let me give you one of these...

55
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:37,353
unofficially, of course.
Save me a postage stamp.

56
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:40,241
- What the hell's this, Manuel?
- A party.

57
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:42,600
It's Lily's idea, actually.
A way to sort of...

58
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:45,724
thank everybody who works here,
keeping the faith while I was gone.

59
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,051
But don't worry,
we're paying for everything.

60
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:50,226
Not a dime of taxpayers' money.

61
00:03:51,828 --> 00:03:53,065
What's going on, Jimmy?

62
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:55,419
You know my daughter Meredith...

63
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:57,653
finally got married
a little more than a year ago.

64
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,168
Nice fella.

65
00:03:59,293 --> 00:04:01,567
He has a little girl
with heart trouble.

66
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:03,304
Actually, that's how they met.

67
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:05,411
Meredith was
the little girl's nurse.

68
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:07,307
Two days ago

69
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:10,583
she sent my wife and me this e-mail.

70
00:04:11,163 --> 00:04:12,563
"Dear Mom and Dad,

71
00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:14,640
"I'm embarrassed to tell you this,

72
00:04:14,765 --> 00:04:16,558
"but I think,
for the first time in my life,

73
00:04:16,683 --> 00:04:19,466
"I understand what it means
to hit rock bottom.

74
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,712
"I think the only cure
is time and distance.

75
00:04:22,837 --> 00:04:24,054
"I need to get away.

76
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:26,723
"This isn't forever,
it's just for now.

77
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:29,336
"I promise to get in touch soon.

78
00:04:30,481 --> 00:04:31,481
"Meredith."

79
00:04:33,495 --> 00:04:34,732
I'm so sorry, Jim.

80
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:36,609
She sent one to her husband, too.

81
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,650
What can I do?
How... can I help you?

82
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,366
She's been gone four days.

83
00:04:43,804 --> 00:04:45,554
My wife, my son-in-law...

84
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:48,746
they're convinced
that she's going to come back.

85
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,075
But this is a girl who's never gone
more than 48 hours

86
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,295
without calling me or her mother
about some crisis or other.

87
00:04:56,778 --> 00:04:58,244
Did you go to the police?

88
00:04:58,369 --> 00:05:00,369
File a missing persons report?

89
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:02,849
I don't want to do that.

90
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:07,222
I'm a councilman. Her husband's a big
shot over at Phoenix West Bank.

91
00:05:07,962 --> 00:05:09,578
They're going to want
to question him.

92
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:11,810
And then the papers will get
ahold of it... no.

93
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:15,998
I have a couple of people who work for
me, pretty good at this kind of thing.

94
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:18,712
And I know I can trust them
to keep it to themselves.

95
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,528
Why don't you let me see
what I can do.

96
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:22,488
Joe.

97
00:05:23,246 --> 00:05:24,246
Joe.

98
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,244
I need you to wake up.

99
00:05:30,643 --> 00:05:31,793
Oh, hey, Doc.

100
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:34,665
Oh, sorry, must have dozed off.

101
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,594
Yeah, the nurse said she's been
trying to wake you for ten minutes.

102
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,811
Devalos said you wanted to see me.

103
00:05:44,936 --> 00:05:46,036
I do indeed.

104
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:49,338
I do indeed.
What's with the funny look?

105
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:52,572
Nothing. You've just been
on my mind lately. You and Lynn.

106
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:55,354
- How you guys doing?
- We're doing...

107
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:57,231
I mean, you know,
to the extent we can.

108
00:05:57,618 --> 00:06:00,106
Haven't you got better things
to think about?

109
00:06:00,702 --> 00:06:01,711
Maybe.

110
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:02,836
Maybe not.

111
00:06:03,883 --> 00:06:05,197
So what's all this?

112
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:07,850
One of Manny's city council
buddies dropped by.

113
00:06:08,096 --> 00:06:10,452
Daughter ran out on her husband
couple days ago.

114
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,247
Papa's stressing
'cause he doesn't know where she is.

115
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:16,680
- Pretty.
- Smart. Went to school.

116
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:18,528
Started premed, dropped out.

117
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:21,296
Became a private nurse, which is...

118
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,410
when she met hubby.

119
00:06:23,963 --> 00:06:25,801
- Was he sick?
- His little girl.

120
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,466
Born with a bad heart.

121
00:06:27,624 --> 00:06:29,374
Waiting for a transplant.

122
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,969
First wife couldn't take
the pressure... took off.

123
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,343
He finally got divorced
in absentia and...

124
00:06:36,586 --> 00:06:38,186
nursie here, Meredith,

125
00:06:38,321 --> 00:06:39,481
took her place.

126
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:43,268
Anyway, I'm going to do the credit card,
cell phone monitoring thing.

127
00:06:43,393 --> 00:06:45,818
See what she might have spent,
where she might have spent it,

128
00:06:45,943 --> 00:06:47,743
who she might have called.

129
00:06:48,278 --> 00:06:50,919
Devalos asked me to put this little
care package together for you

130
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:53,718
in hopes that you might do
that voodoo you do, but I...

131
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,414
I have a hunch our little
wifey just parked herself

132
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,709
- in a four-star hotel somewhere.
- Nice car.

133
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,281
Daddy's little girl has
to have a nice car.

134
00:07:03,061 --> 00:07:06,383
So Marie, little Marie,
when he gave her her shot,

135
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:08,261
she smiled, Joe.

136
00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:09,974
And Bridgette...

137
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:15,405
You would have thought that
he was performing open-heart surgery

138
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,894
without anesthesia.

139
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,148
So afterward,
I took them to the toy store.

140
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,751
I'm proud of you.

141
00:07:24,056 --> 00:07:26,652
Not letting
your previously held convictions

142
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,174
get in the way of making
our children happy.

143
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:34,745
I got to talk to you about something
that happened at the doctor's office.

144
00:07:35,457 --> 00:07:37,782
What are you talking about?
You told me everything was fine.

145
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:40,378
Yeah, it is. Well, sort of.

146
00:07:41,716 --> 00:07:43,916
He seemed to think
that I have some kind of

147
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,166
a sleep deprivation thing going on.

148
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:48,828
Doesn't everybody over
the age of 12 have a little

149
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:50,869
sleep deprivation thing going on?

150
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:53,931
I don't know, he seemed to think that
it was something to be taken seriously.

151
00:07:55,145 --> 00:07:56,445
All right, well,

152
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,607
- what would make him think that?
- I think he got his first inkling

153
00:07:59,732 --> 00:08:02,320
when I fell asleep
in his waiting room this morning.

154
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:03,611
Oh, my.

155
00:08:04,258 --> 00:08:06,858
The truth is,
I am exhausted all the time.

156
00:08:09,214 --> 00:08:10,964
At first, he wanted to...

157
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,160
check me into the hospital
one night next week

158
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,835
and do a sleep study.

159
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:19,195
That's where they hook you up
to a computer and they...

160
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:21,792
they try to figure out
what the problem is.

161
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:24,734
Then after we... you know, we...

162
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,588
we talked for a little while,
we both realized...

163
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:35,597
What, you both think
this is my fault?

164
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,609
Fault?
Nobody mentioned fault.

165
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,609
I didn't use the word "fault."

166
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:42,563
Okay, what word would you use?

167
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:45,516
I don't want to use any word. I think
the doctor's just trying to figure out

168
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:46,786
cause and effect.

169
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:49,056
I don't think
that fault factors into it.

170
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:50,315
And I'm the cause.

171
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,715
Okay, look,
I wouldn't use the word "cause" either.

172
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,341
But, you've got to be realistic.

173
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:57,836
You're up once or twice a night, which
means that I'm up once or twice a night.

174
00:08:57,961 --> 00:09:01,300
The problem is after you tell me about
your dream I can't get back to sleep.

175
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:04,168
I sit here and I stare
and I wait for the sun to come up

176
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,206
or for you to have another dream.

177
00:09:08,985 --> 00:09:10,507
So what does he want us to do?

178
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,340
What are we talking here?
Ear plugs, or...

179
00:09:15,157 --> 00:09:18,557
How do we handle this?
I don't want you to be exhausted.

180
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:21,852
Initially,
he wants us to try sleeping apart.

181
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,270
- That's his plan?
- Just for a week.

182
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:27,683
I think it's more diagnostic
than anything else.

183
00:09:27,808 --> 00:09:29,610
If after a week
I'm feeling better, then...

184
00:09:30,015 --> 00:09:32,520
What? If after a week
you're feeling better... what?

185
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:34,832
That we'd sleep apart forever?

186
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:36,881
Doesn't sound like much of a plan.

187
00:09:37,006 --> 00:09:38,936
Well, that's not his plan,
that's your plan.

188
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:42,311
I mean, I'm sure he's got some
kind of a protocol in mind if this...

189
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:44,936
you know, in fact,
turns out to be the problem.

190
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,081
3:20 in the morning.

191
00:11:07,406 --> 00:11:08,656
You poor thing.

192
00:11:12,836 --> 00:11:14,840
Allison Dubois asked for you today.

193
00:11:15,445 --> 00:11:17,551
Oh, yeah?
Did you say hi for me?

194
00:11:17,897 --> 00:11:19,253
Yeah, course I did.

195
00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:22,318
You look at the mail
in the living room?

196
00:11:22,443 --> 00:11:24,975
Devalos is having a party.
He's sweet.

197
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:28,458
He sent one invitation to you here
and one invitation to me at my place.

198
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:31,106
So should I just RSVP
for the two of us?

199
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:34,526
I don't know.
I can't even think about that right now.

200
00:11:35,122 --> 00:11:37,404
Be careful in there.
Might still be a little toxic.

201
00:11:38,223 --> 00:11:39,573
Really? Rough night?

202
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,910
Morning sickness.
Talk about false advertising.

203
00:11:44,808 --> 00:11:47,440
Of course, I guess if they called it
all day, all night sickness,

204
00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:49,841
nobody would ever want
to get pregnant.

205
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:55,912
Daddy?

206
00:11:56,704 --> 00:11:57,704
Daddy?

207
00:11:58,448 --> 00:11:59,448
Daddy...

208
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:06,156
Are you and Mommy having a divorce?

209
00:12:08,774 --> 00:12:09,974
Well, are you?

210
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:12,901
No, of course not.

211
00:12:14,382 --> 00:12:16,944
Nobody's getting a divorce.

212
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:20,966
Why would you even think
something like that?

213
00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:22,157
Bridgette!

214
00:12:22,412 --> 00:12:25,748
What? All I said was that,
right after Celeste McEvoy's dad

215
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:28,580
started sleeping on the couch,
they got a divorce.

216
00:12:28,807 --> 00:12:29,957
And they did.

217
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,544
You told Marie that her dad then took
her to Universal in Florida for a week.

218
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,337
Now she thinks
we're going to Florida.

219
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:37,673
Are we going to Florida?

220
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:41,657
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Nobody's getting divorced.

221
00:12:41,782 --> 00:12:44,460
Mom and Dad aren't getting divorced.
Come here!

222
00:12:44,585 --> 00:12:46,529
Daddy just needed a good night's sleep,
you know,

223
00:12:46,654 --> 00:12:48,892
'cause sometimes your mom is,
you know...

224
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,535
I can hear that.

225
00:12:51,218 --> 00:12:54,481
Why isn't everybody eating? Everybody
should be eating. It's getting late.

226
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,727
Oh, hey, did you see the mail?

227
00:12:56,852 --> 00:12:58,485
Devalos is having a party.

228
00:12:59,255 --> 00:13:01,568
Daddy's taking me to Florida.

229
00:13:05,312 --> 00:13:07,465
They started dredging
the lake around 7:00 this morning.

230
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,287
By 8:30, they found her.

231
00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:13,869
Oh, my God!

232
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,814
I don't get it. This can't be Meredith.
She's only been missing three days.

233
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:21,133
This woman looks like
she's been in the lake for years.

234
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:23,819
Good guess.
We're thinking two, actually.

235
00:13:23,944 --> 00:13:25,317
She was wearing this.

236
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:26,913
It's an engraved wedding band.

237
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:28,557
"From Don to Clare. Always."

238
00:13:28,993 --> 00:13:30,443
Clare? Who's Clare?

239
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:33,326
That would be Meredith's
husband's first wife.

240
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:34,626
And this is her?

241
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:36,478
In the flesh... or the bones...

242
00:13:36,603 --> 00:13:37,835
or whatever.

243
00:13:39,856 --> 00:13:41,681
So Don's first wife
wasn't just missing.

244
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:44,030
She didn't just run away.
She was murdered.

245
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,824
Obviously, she was murdered,

246
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:47,874
but that doesn't mean
she didn't run away first.

247
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:49,751
A stranger could have done this.

248
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:51,826
Now his second wife is missing?

249
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:55,809
Seems like being married to this Don
is a dangerous way to live your life.

250
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:58,961
I was so sure that I was seeing
Meredith's murder. I even saw her car.

251
00:13:59,891 --> 00:14:02,063
Maybe her car was part of it.
Maybe Don borrowed her car,

252
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:05,719
used it to transport the body so
there wouldn't be any DNA left in his.

253
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,344
You want to ask him?

254
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:12,079
Can I help you?

255
00:14:12,204 --> 00:14:14,772
I'm Detective Scanlon.
This is Allison Dubois.

256
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:17,139
We're hoping to speak
with Don Burnes.

257
00:14:17,562 --> 00:14:20,410
I really can't see that.
I'll have to take your word for it.

258
00:14:20,535 --> 00:14:23,028
I lost my glasses a few days ago.
Please come in.

259
00:14:29,074 --> 00:14:31,452
I'm Louise Leaming.
Meredith's mother.

260
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,585
Councilman Leaming's wife.

261
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:37,000
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Leaming.
This must be a terrible time for you.

262
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:41,102
Not really. No. I told James not
to bother you people with this.

263
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:42,953
Meredith's fine. She's...

264
00:14:43,928 --> 00:14:45,258
She will turn up.

265
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:48,504
She'll come home.
She's just...

266
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Meredith.

267
00:14:51,045 --> 00:14:53,266
Honey, tell your father that

268
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:56,512
some people from the district attorney's
office are here, all right?

269
00:14:58,006 --> 00:14:59,648
Did either of you
ever meet Meredith?

270
00:15:02,642 --> 00:15:05,192
Well, she's mine,
and I love her, but...

271
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,782
she thrives on attention

272
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,305
the way the rest of us
depend on oxygen.

273
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:13,389
This is her idea of bliss.

274
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,724
Everybody is worried about her,
thinking about her, talking about her.

275
00:15:23,664 --> 00:15:25,139
I shouldn't be negative.

276
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,636
She is an extraordinary caregiver,

277
00:15:28,357 --> 00:15:29,957
a wonderful nurse.

278
00:15:30,082 --> 00:15:33,181
She has brought me
the most marvelous grandchild.

279
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:36,483
She looks terrific, by the way.
Phoebe, I mean.

280
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:38,545
Heard about her heart condition.

281
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,855
That she's waiting for a donor.
You would never know.

282
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:42,192
Oh, thank you.

283
00:15:42,698 --> 00:15:45,623
Yes. She's...
She's at a good period right now.

284
00:15:45,748 --> 00:15:46,998
Last week, I...

285
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:50,568
I was afraid
we were going to lose her.

286
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,746
She still misses Meredith.

287
00:15:53,114 --> 00:15:55,441
That's why I'm here.
To keep her mind off it.

288
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:56,566
Louise?

289
00:16:03,271 --> 00:16:04,521
I'm Don Burnes.

290
00:16:05,337 --> 00:16:08,187
I'll keep Phoebe occupied
while you three talk.

291
00:16:12,082 --> 00:16:13,232
Sit down.

292
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:20,812
- Any news?
- Well, there is,

293
00:16:22,163 --> 00:16:24,540
but it doesn't have anything
to do with Meredith.

294
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:25,779
We've...

295
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:28,669
found your first wife's remains,
Mr. Burnes.

296
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,432
She was beaten and then drowned.

297
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:39,178
When? And...

298
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:41,868
- by who?
- We don't know that yet,

299
00:16:42,158 --> 00:16:44,261
but obviously, this changes
the way we look at things

300
00:16:44,386 --> 00:16:46,421
with regard
to the second Mrs. Burnes.

301
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:50,343
I see.
So this is a dual purpose visit.

302
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:53,260
You're not being accused of
anything at the moment, Mr. Burnes,

303
00:16:53,827 --> 00:16:55,805
but you're a person of interest.

304
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,642
We're in the process of obtaining
a warrant to search your house.

305
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,740
You don't need a warrant.

306
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,199
You have my permission
to look wherever you want.

307
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,913
Phoebe and I can stay
with Meredith's folks for a few days,

308
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:10,057
so there won't be anyone
here in your way.

309
00:17:10,182 --> 00:17:12,469
I appreciate you making this easy,
Mr. Burnes.

310
00:17:12,594 --> 00:17:15,100
I'll be sure and mention it
to the district attorney.

311
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,426
You do that.

312
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:19,662
Also tell him

313
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:23,094
that these women were taken from me,

314
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:25,179
not by me.

315
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,313
Give him that message.

316
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,347
You got your cell phone in here?

317
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,347
No, it's in the kitchen,
where I want it.

318
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,642
I'm sleeping out on the couch.

319
00:17:41,463 --> 00:17:43,163
- What?
- You heard me.

320
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:47,152
If we're going to do this, we're going
to take turns. It's my turn tonight.

321
00:17:47,355 --> 00:17:48,355
So...

322
00:17:48,739 --> 00:17:50,989
I've unplugged the phone for you...

323
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:53,428
given you clean sheets.

324
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,323
I want you to get eight hours of...

325
00:17:57,261 --> 00:17:59,537
beautiful, uninterrupted sleep.

326
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:07,599
- Meredith... right on time as always.
- Mrs. Burnes.

327
00:18:07,724 --> 00:18:09,457
This stuff is a drug, you know.

328
00:18:09,582 --> 00:18:11,693
It's okay. It's legal.
I'm a nurse.

329
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:14,384
So how's my girl doing today?

330
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:16,939
Ah, Phoebe? Not so well.

331
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:19,153
She had a rough night.

332
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,268
We all had a rough night.

333
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,352
I'm guessing she'll be sleeping
for a while.

334
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:25,877
You sit here.

335
00:18:26,002 --> 00:18:27,856
- I just need to finish this.
- You relax.

336
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,451
You're the missus, I'm the help.

337
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:32,976
Drink your poison.

338
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:36,945
I don't know about you, Meredith.

339
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,658
You're some kind of saint.

340
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:42,245
I keep saying to Don, "That woman,
she is too good to be true.

341
00:18:42,587 --> 00:18:45,415
She's got to be going home
at night and kicking her cat."

342
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,792
Never with my shoes on,
only with my socks.

343
00:19:02,638 --> 00:19:03,933
You all right, Mrs. Burnes?

344
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:11,941
Don't worry.

345
00:19:12,644 --> 00:19:14,094
It'll be over soon.

346
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:48,353
Oh! Good morning, Chef Boyardee.

347
00:19:49,893 --> 00:19:52,106
I was trying to be quiet.
Did I wake you?

348
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,984
No. Not you.
Just the smell of all that good food.

349
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:57,599
You got a good night's sleep,
didn't you?

350
00:19:58,062 --> 00:19:59,562
I cannot tell a lie.

351
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,756
Look at you. You're beaming.

352
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:02,981
I hate that.

353
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,340
How was your night, my dear?

354
00:20:07,693 --> 00:20:09,543
Not for the faint of heart.

355
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:14,462
Turns out that woman we've been looking
for, Councilman Leaming's daughter...

356
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,116
She murdered
her husband's first wife.

357
00:20:20,362 --> 00:20:23,762
Now, what would posses somebody
to do something like that?

358
00:20:23,887 --> 00:20:25,037
I don't know.

359
00:20:26,163 --> 00:20:28,832
Maybe Don loved her.

360
00:20:28,957 --> 00:20:31,246
Maybe she loved Don. Maybe...

361
00:20:31,371 --> 00:20:32,949
maybe Don wasn't in on it.

362
00:20:33,074 --> 00:20:35,024
Maybe Don found out about it,

363
00:20:35,424 --> 00:20:38,324
and killed her to avenge
his first wife's death.

364
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:42,335
Do you see all the good stuff

365
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,655
that you miss
when you don't sleep with me?

366
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,653
We're almost ready.
You want to go wake the kids?

367
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,000
Oh, that's right. We have kids.

368
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,420
I just rembered.
Today is Dentist Day.

369
00:20:55,912 --> 00:20:58,055
- Dentist Day?
- Yeah. After school.

370
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,082
Oh, boy. More toys.

371
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:17,859
What time is it?

372
00:21:18,624 --> 00:21:20,236
It's 10:40 in the morning.

373
00:21:21,034 --> 00:21:23,907
Well, what are you doing here?
I thought you were Miss Early Bird.

374
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,225
I like to be.

375
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,685
But I need to talk to you
about something.

376
00:21:28,441 --> 00:21:32,410
And, lately, it seems like you only come
home when you think I might be asleep,

377
00:21:32,535 --> 00:21:35,041
and you only wake up
when you think I might be gone.

378
00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:37,921
What is it, Lynn?
What do you want to talk about?

379
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:40,256
I need to RSVP to that party.

380
00:21:42,831 --> 00:21:43,831
Oh. Okay.

381
00:21:46,582 --> 00:21:49,071
Well, you know what?
Don't worry about it. You...

382
00:21:49,644 --> 00:21:52,769
take care of your RSVP,
and I'll take care of mine.

383
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,730
So we're not going together?

384
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,060
I don't know; I have no idea.

385
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:03,718
I mean, to be perfectly honest with you,
I've given this absolutely no thought.

386
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:06,449
Frankly, I'm kind of amazed
you have.

387
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:09,875
Yeah, well...

388
00:22:10,449 --> 00:22:13,399
maybe it's the hormones.
I don't know, I mean...

389
00:22:13,793 --> 00:22:16,732
I know there are a lot more
important conversations to be had.

390
00:22:18,193 --> 00:22:20,676
A lot more important
conversations being avoided.

391
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,544
You know why I leave here so early?

392
00:22:28,006 --> 00:22:30,409
I want to get behind my desk
before anyone else gets in

393
00:22:30,534 --> 00:22:32,806
so I don't have to answer
any questions.

394
00:22:33,194 --> 00:22:34,294
'Cause, Lee,

395
00:22:34,997 --> 00:22:36,688
I don't know how to answer them.

396
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,375
It's our baby, Lee.

397
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,095
And I know we didn't plan it.
I know you didn't bargain for it.

398
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,966
I don't expect you to marry me.

399
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,241
I'm not asking you to do anything,

400
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,120
except...

401
00:22:52,682 --> 00:22:54,872
please don't ask me
to go into that party,

402
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,922
looking like this...

403
00:22:58,103 --> 00:22:59,103
by myself.

404
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:06,301
Anyway, you think about it.

405
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:18,402
See? This whole side of my mouth is,
like, dead.

406
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:20,222
Still can't feel a thing.

407
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,151
I think the dentist might have
drilled into your brain by accident.

408
00:23:23,756 --> 00:23:25,852
All right, Bridge, Marie, come on...

409
00:23:26,331 --> 00:23:27,831
it's almost bedtime.

410
00:23:29,527 --> 00:23:31,277
Marie, what's the matter?

411
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:32,959
Knock, knock.

412
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,068
Go away. I'm not home.

413
00:23:41,182 --> 00:23:45,048
What an inscrutable expression. What has
gone through that brain of yours?

414
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:46,758
I'm frustrated.

415
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,426
I could maybe help you with that.

416
00:23:49,332 --> 00:23:51,182
Not that kind of frustrated.

417
00:23:51,883 --> 00:23:54,140
I want to know
where Meredith Burnes is.

418
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,515
You know, this Meredith woman,
you know, she'll show up.

419
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,407
Trust me.
She's not Jimmy Hoffa.

420
00:23:58,532 --> 00:24:00,521
Eventually, they'll find her,
they'll find the car.

421
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,972
There'll be some DNA
or something in the trunk.

422
00:24:03,097 --> 00:24:05,651
You know, she'll go up the river.
Hey, you know I'm right.

423
00:24:06,687 --> 00:24:08,481
Oh, is that why you came in here?

424
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:12,558
To harass me with your positivism
and your good mood,

425
00:24:13,137 --> 00:24:16,204
now that you're getting full nights
of uninterrupted sleep?

426
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,248
Actually, no...
I came in here to pass along a request.

427
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:21,876
- What kind of request?
- Apparently,

428
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:25,213
it has not gone unnoticed
that you and I no longer share a bed.

429
00:24:25,584 --> 00:24:27,980
And this is incredibly
awkward for me, but,

430
00:24:28,821 --> 00:24:32,470
it would appear that there's somebody
else who would like to sleep with you.

431
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:35,161
Marie.

432
00:24:47,603 --> 00:24:49,053
Look what I've got.

433
00:24:53,051 --> 00:24:54,151
Looks great.

434
00:24:55,173 --> 00:24:56,599
I'm really not hungry.

435
00:24:56,724 --> 00:24:57,807
Oh, come on.

436
00:24:57,932 --> 00:24:59,209
Just a little bit.

437
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:02,458
I've added lots of vitamins
and healthy stuff to the ice cream.

438
00:25:02,982 --> 00:25:04,815
Can't even taste how good
it is for you.

439
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,656
Go on, sweetheart, just a sip.

440
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:14,929
They're coming this afternoon to dig
a hole for the swimming pool.

441
00:25:15,502 --> 00:25:16,507
Really?

442
00:25:16,742 --> 00:25:18,935
- When will it be finished?
- In a couple of weeks.

443
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,145
Just in time for you to get
your strength back and pay us a visit.

444
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:26,173
- Here, Grandma, you finish it.
- No.

445
00:25:29,442 --> 00:25:31,612
Meredith, what on earth
is all that about?

446
00:25:32,675 --> 00:25:35,449
Phoebe has a fever, mother. Shouldn't
be drinking out of the same glass.

447
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,498
Well, she always has a temperature.

448
00:25:38,008 --> 00:25:39,782
You and I are always around her.

449
00:25:39,907 --> 00:25:41,622
So clearly, she's not contagious.

450
00:25:45,118 --> 00:25:46,868
But we love you, Grandma.

451
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:50,214
We don't want to take any chances
with your health. Right?

452
00:25:52,071 --> 00:25:53,071
Right.

453
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:06,689
What? What's the matter?

454
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,224
You all right?

455
00:26:08,896 --> 00:26:10,970
I suddenly don't feel so good,
Grandma.

456
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,654
My stomach always feels
worse after I eat.

457
00:26:36,757 --> 00:26:39,260
They pointed to this room,
but I wasn't sure if...

458
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:40,973
You know Mrs. Dubois.

459
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,436
You found your glasses.

460
00:26:45,793 --> 00:26:48,601
Oh, these? No, they're new.
The others never did turn up.

461
00:26:48,726 --> 00:26:50,590
- Well, they're lovely.
- Thank you.

462
00:26:50,715 --> 00:26:51,715
Please.

463
00:26:52,841 --> 00:26:54,408
So I'm sure

464
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:57,281
you're curious why we called you,
asked you to come down here.

465
00:26:57,541 --> 00:27:00,181
Well, I was hoping
that you'd have some news.

466
00:27:00,306 --> 00:27:03,185
Although, I couldn't for the life
of me figure out why you...

467
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,910
called me and not Jim.

468
00:27:06,922 --> 00:27:09,422
Actually, there is some news,
of a sort.

469
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:11,774
Are you familiar
with Mrs. Dubois here?

470
00:27:11,975 --> 00:27:14,015
I know the two of you
have spoken, but...

471
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,275
have you heard about who she is,
what she does?

472
00:27:17,308 --> 00:27:18,713
I didn't when we first met,

473
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:21,681
but my husband told me
about you this morning.

474
00:27:22,044 --> 00:27:23,899
Allison had a dream last night.

475
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:25,889
It was about Meredith.

476
00:27:26,014 --> 00:27:27,698
You're kidding. Where...

477
00:27:28,532 --> 00:27:30,554
did you see her? Where was she?

478
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:33,556
It wasn't that kind of dream.
It was set in the past.

479
00:27:34,555 --> 00:27:36,639
Meredith was in it, you were in it,

480
00:27:36,764 --> 00:27:38,764
- Phoebe was in it.
- Phoebe?

481
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:41,402
Meredith was taking care of her.

482
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:43,358
You weren't convinced that...

483
00:27:43,483 --> 00:27:45,705
what she was doing
was best for the child.

484
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,039
Louise, the more time and effort

485
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:50,338
we put into investigating
where Meredith is,

486
00:27:50,463 --> 00:27:53,796
the more we seem to be discovering
about who Meredith was.

487
00:27:54,546 --> 00:27:56,246
What she was capable of.

488
00:27:58,446 --> 00:27:59,446
Did you...

489
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:02,633
encourage her to get away?

490
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:05,474
Help her in any way?
Perhaps give her some money?

491
00:28:08,241 --> 00:28:09,241
I'm...

492
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:12,523
I'm sorry. This meeting is over.

493
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:17,659
I know how you feel, Louise.
I have three daughters of my own.

494
00:28:17,784 --> 00:28:19,739
But you can't protect
Meredith forever.

495
00:28:21,068 --> 00:28:23,700
Tell me, Mrs. Dubois, what would one
of your daughters have to do

496
00:28:23,825 --> 00:28:26,466
before you could say,
"That's it, I'm done."

497
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,730
I can't protect her anymore.

498
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,532
I'm so sorry I couldn't have been
more... help to you both.

499
00:28:53,939 --> 00:28:55,873
Interesting schedule you're on.

500
00:28:56,223 --> 00:28:58,701
Think I'm quite the night owl
last couple of weeks.

501
00:28:58,826 --> 00:29:01,222
So will I be seeing you at my little
soiree tomorrow night?

502
00:29:01,347 --> 00:29:04,866
Lynn left me a voice mail.
I know she's gonna be there, but a...

503
00:29:05,273 --> 00:29:08,509
certain police detective
seems to be playing hard to get.

504
00:29:08,634 --> 00:29:11,432
- What can I tell you?
- If you're gonna be there or not.

505
00:29:11,557 --> 00:29:13,903
So if I show up at the last minute,
you're not gonna let me in?

506
00:29:14,028 --> 00:29:15,278
You never know.

507
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:18,019
You guys okay?

508
00:29:19,804 --> 00:29:22,531
No, we're good.
It's just, uh, something's come up,

509
00:29:22,656 --> 00:29:24,690
I guess we have to deal with.
I have to deal with.

510
00:29:24,815 --> 00:29:26,215
Have to figure out...

511
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:27,940
how I feel about it.

512
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,977
Think I was kind of hoping it'd just
go away, but it's not going anywhere.

513
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:34,008
Do I know what you're talking about?

514
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:36,897
Are you kidding? I'm not sure
I know what I'm talking about.

515
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:42,303
You know the great thing
about being alone?

516
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,440
There's no one to let down.

517
00:29:48,742 --> 00:29:50,246
So will I see you there?

518
00:29:52,403 --> 00:29:54,953
If I'm there,
you will definitely see me.

519
00:29:58,474 --> 00:30:01,354
She's covering for her.
She's absolutely covering for her.

520
00:30:01,654 --> 00:30:04,579
She gave her money,
sent her away someplace. I just know it.

521
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,640
At one point,
she actually admitted it.

522
00:30:08,176 --> 00:30:10,438
She asked, "Is there anything
one of your daughters could do

523
00:30:10,563 --> 00:30:12,720
"that would make you
turn your back on her?"

524
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:15,313
And you know,
when she asked that, I understood.

525
00:30:16,306 --> 00:30:18,406
If it was one of our children...

526
00:30:20,013 --> 00:30:21,313
Could you do it?

527
00:30:22,536 --> 00:30:24,136
Could you turn her in?

528
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,119
Joe.

529
00:30:36,983 --> 00:30:38,485
What's going on?

530
00:30:39,118 --> 00:30:40,268
I'm confused.

531
00:30:41,288 --> 00:30:44,169
Didn't you say you've been sleeping
straight through the night?

532
00:30:45,413 --> 00:30:46,792
- Why?
- Well, you just...

533
00:30:46,917 --> 00:30:49,100
you just fell asleep
right here, right now.

534
00:30:51,154 --> 00:30:53,054
That doesn't make any sense.

535
00:30:57,181 --> 00:31:00,262
Maybe I should call
that doctor again in the morning.

536
00:31:01,162 --> 00:31:03,935
Well, I know our insurance
isn't gonna cover it, but...

537
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,505
I think maybe you should
get a second opinion.

538
00:31:07,994 --> 00:31:09,894
Must be 115 out there today.

539
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,193
Try not to let it hurt my feelings

540
00:31:14,318 --> 00:31:16,722
that you're finally getting around
to putting in a pool.

541
00:31:16,847 --> 00:31:18,467
15 years after I leave home.

542
00:31:18,592 --> 00:31:20,961
For a little girl who isn't even
really your granddaughter.

543
00:31:23,421 --> 00:31:26,740
- You know I'm kidding.
- Mm. Oh, yes, I know you're kidding.

544
00:31:27,244 --> 00:31:29,804
I can't stay long.
What'd you want to talk about?

545
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,118
I want to talk about Phoebe.

546
00:31:32,374 --> 00:31:35,100
I'm worried that she's getting sick
all the time.

547
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:37,728
Fevers, stomachaches.

548
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:41,066
I- I spoke to some doctors
who find it very puzzling.

549
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,664
I mean, she has a...
she has a heart condition,

550
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:45,736
not an immune deficiency.

551
00:31:46,846 --> 00:31:49,605
I don't know what to tell you, Mother.
She's sick.

552
00:31:50,204 --> 00:31:51,554
She's sick a lot.

553
00:31:52,314 --> 00:31:55,085
- Since I've been taking care of her.
- I know, dear.

554
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,565
That's why we should get
a second opinion.

555
00:31:57,853 --> 00:31:59,596
Then run some more tests.

556
00:31:59,721 --> 00:32:02,854
Maybe there's something
that we can do

557
00:32:02,979 --> 00:32:04,421
that will help.

558
00:32:04,824 --> 00:32:06,374
No, I don't think so.

559
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:10,279
I'm not putting Phoebe through that.
I'm not putting Don through that.

560
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,192
I said no, Mother.

561
00:32:12,737 --> 00:32:14,489
Phoebe's not yours, she's mine.

562
00:32:15,091 --> 00:32:18,491
And I'll decide when and if
she needs to see more doctors.

563
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:23,429
Is that it? Is that why
I came all the way over here?

564
00:32:23,554 --> 00:32:25,331
Because I really need
to get home now.

565
00:32:25,456 --> 00:32:27,690
It's almost time for Phoebe's lunch.

566
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,596
I'm so sorry, Meredith.

567
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,741
Maybe there's something that I could've
done when you were a child,

568
00:32:34,074 --> 00:32:36,752
- but I didn't see it.
- What are you talking about, Mother?

569
00:32:36,877 --> 00:32:39,247
Maybe your father and I
were too indulgent.

570
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:43,168
You were an only child.
You were the center of our universe.

571
00:32:44,281 --> 00:32:45,381
And maybe...

572
00:32:45,956 --> 00:32:48,156
maybe you were just born this way.

573
00:32:49,292 --> 00:32:51,392
Maybe you came into the world...

574
00:32:52,501 --> 00:32:53,679
with something missing.

575
00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:55,645
Something...

576
00:32:55,962 --> 00:32:57,462
crucially important.

577
00:32:58,308 --> 00:32:59,708
Well, at any rate,

578
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,600
I am still your mother,

579
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,361
and I need to take
responsibility for you.

580
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,569
And I need to protect Phoebe.

581
00:33:09,016 --> 00:33:10,016
Phoebe?

582
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,319
Why is everything
always about Phoebe?

583
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,328
Mom...

584
00:33:19,512 --> 00:33:20,782
Oh, my God.

585
00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:23,529
Something's wrong.

586
00:33:23,654 --> 00:33:24,954
What's going on?

587
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,463
Now, it's all right.

588
00:33:28,588 --> 00:33:30,980
It's all right, sweetheart.
Here, just sit here.

589
00:33:31,105 --> 00:33:33,358
- Just relax. It's okay.
- Mom...

590
00:33:33,483 --> 00:33:36,839
- Mommy, what's happening?
- It's all right. Just close your eyes.

591
00:33:36,964 --> 00:33:39,308
Close your eyes. I'm here. I'm here.
It's all right.

592
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,518
Close your eyes.

593
00:33:43,712 --> 00:33:44,962
I'm right here.

594
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:48,425
I love you.

595
00:34:09,126 --> 00:34:10,886
<i>The great plays, the great movies,</i>

596
00:34:11,011 --> 00:34:13,845
<i>the great books
that have been written about family,</i>

597
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:18,086
<i>they would all like you to believe
that blood is thicker than water.</i>

598
00:34:18,788 --> 00:34:20,103
<i>But in real life,</i>

599
00:34:20,228 --> 00:34:23,185
<i>a broken heart can sometimes
make blood run thin...</i>

600
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:26,227
- Thank you.
- <i>... and water run thick.</i>

601
00:34:27,325 --> 00:34:28,475
Mrs. Leaming?

602
00:34:31,274 --> 00:34:32,695
Well, good morning.

603
00:34:33,565 --> 00:34:36,694
I hope you don't mind. I tried to ring
the bell, but nobody answered.

604
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,697
Oh, no, no, no.
That's fine.

605
00:34:38,822 --> 00:34:40,508
This is where the action is.

606
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,372
What brings you by here
this morning, Mrs. Dubois?

607
00:34:44,126 --> 00:34:45,666
I had another dream last night.

608
00:34:46,522 --> 00:34:47,529
Really?

609
00:34:47,935 --> 00:34:49,185
You were in it.

610
00:34:50,036 --> 00:34:51,463
Meredith was in it.

611
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:55,592
You were serving her iced tea.

612
00:35:00,114 --> 00:35:02,975
I have to tell the district attorney
what I know.

613
00:35:11,775 --> 00:35:13,025
Of course, I...

614
00:35:14,259 --> 00:35:15,859
I'd rather you didn't.

615
00:35:16,456 --> 00:35:19,282
But I'm confused. When you found out
what your daughter was doing,

616
00:35:19,407 --> 00:35:20,826
why didn't you call the police?

617
00:35:21,326 --> 00:35:23,692
Because she's my daughter.

618
00:35:24,906 --> 00:35:26,972
I couldn't let Phoebe

619
00:35:27,437 --> 00:35:29,687
know what Meredith had done to her.

620
00:35:30,318 --> 00:35:32,299
And I couldn't let my son-in-law

621
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:34,909
spend his life blaming himself.

622
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:37,721
And my husband?

623
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,712
No, no, no, no, no.

624
00:35:40,823 --> 00:35:42,306
I just couldn't do it.

625
00:35:44,154 --> 00:35:46,783
I need to protect Phoebe.

626
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:50,981
This way,

627
00:35:51,386 --> 00:35:52,586
Meredith is...

628
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:55,880
just gone.
And everybody misses her,

629
00:35:56,485 --> 00:35:59,049
and when they think of her,
they think of...

630
00:35:59,174 --> 00:36:01,844
a loving wife, mother, daughter...

631
00:36:02,573 --> 00:36:04,705
that they believe that she was.

632
00:36:07,282 --> 00:36:08,282
Grandma.

633
00:36:21,402 --> 00:36:22,902
For what it's worth,

634
00:36:23,445 --> 00:36:24,445
I don't...

635
00:36:24,915 --> 00:36:27,187
actually know where the body is.
I don't...

636
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:29,269
I don't even know where to find it.

637
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:33,789
Maybe there's not that much
to tell my boss after all.

638
00:36:36,855 --> 00:36:38,555
You do what you have to.

639
00:36:44,409 --> 00:36:45,409
I...

640
00:36:50,336 --> 00:36:51,336
Excuse me.

641
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,380
Could you do me a favor
and give these to Mrs. Leaming.

642
00:36:56,732 --> 00:36:59,318
We're about to lay out the steel
framing for the swimming pool.

643
00:36:59,443 --> 00:37:01,548
And they were lying at the bottom,
in the dirt.

644
00:37:01,673 --> 00:37:03,512
You found these
at the bottom of the pool?

645
00:37:17,698 --> 00:37:21,153
- Where's your other half?
- Doctor's office. He'll be here soon.

646
00:37:21,512 --> 00:37:23,162
You see the Leamings...

647
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:24,875
James, Louise?

648
00:37:25,267 --> 00:37:27,295
Why? Did you think
they'd really come here?

649
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,670
No, not really.

650
00:37:29,175 --> 00:37:31,622
Not after all their family's
been through, not...

651
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,208
after the grilling
we gave Louise yesterday.

652
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:36,233
Still, in all, I feel badly.

653
00:37:37,179 --> 00:37:39,479
I feel like I haven't been
a very good friend.

654
00:37:39,604 --> 00:37:42,843
Sir, I think there's something I need
to tell you that I discovered today.

655
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:50,210
Excuse me, Allison. Apparently I have
an urgent call. I'll be right back.

656
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:02,779


657
00:38:30,004 --> 00:38:30,807
Sir.

658
00:38:32,162 --> 00:38:33,912
Will you be dining alone?

659
00:38:34,393 --> 00:38:35,993
Why, do I look lonely?

660
00:38:50,426 --> 00:38:54,373
- I got a phone call from James Leaming.
- I need to tell you about Louise...

661
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,667
- What?
- Excuse me? No, you first.

662
00:38:56,854 --> 00:38:59,086
No, no, no, you first.
You said you got a call?

663
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,689
I sure did... from Councilman Leaming
and you won't believe it...

664
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:03,695
they're on their way
to the hospital right now.

665
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,687
A heart for Phoebe
just became available.

666
00:39:05,812 --> 00:39:07,691
They're flying it in
to Phoenix as we speak.

667
00:39:07,816 --> 00:39:10,555
- That girl's going to get a transplant.
- That's amazing news.

668
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,897
Jim said that Phoebe's elated,
but that Louise,

669
00:39:14,022 --> 00:39:16,061
Louise is over the moon.

670
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:23,770
And what did you want to tell me?

671
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:26,488
No, no, no, no.
No, it's nothing.

672
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:48,876
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey, stranger.

673
00:39:50,132 --> 00:39:51,532
Okay, so I'll ask.

674
00:39:52,102 --> 00:39:53,724
- What's new?
- I don't know.

675
00:39:54,678 --> 00:39:56,328
So what's new with you?

676
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,495
Congratulations!

677
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:01,625
Thank you.

678
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:06,103
Congratulations, Lynn.

679
00:40:07,117 --> 00:40:08,367
You look great.

680
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:11,175
Congratulations, Lynn.

681
00:40:30,648 --> 00:40:31,698
I'm an ass.

682
00:40:32,796 --> 00:40:33,796
A big ass.

683
00:40:34,439 --> 00:40:35,439
My ass.

684
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,622
So what do we do now?

685
00:40:50,899 --> 00:40:54,433
How about we get through this as quick
as we can, so we can get home...

686
00:40:54,558 --> 00:40:57,483
have all those important conversations
that need to be had.

687
00:40:57,608 --> 00:40:59,696
All those important
conversations that...

688
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,249
keep being avoided.

689
00:41:18,802 --> 00:41:20,402
You here with anybody?

690
00:41:21,678 --> 00:41:22,928
You look happy.

691
00:41:23,057 --> 00:41:24,057
Hi.

692
00:41:24,556 --> 00:41:26,156
I like this new doctor.

693
00:41:26,281 --> 00:41:27,257
Oh, you do?

694
00:41:27,382 --> 00:41:30,656
Yeah, he's one of those old guys...
real wise, really smart.

695
00:41:31,149 --> 00:41:32,408
So what did he say?

696
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:35,951
You know, he said pretty much the same
thing that the first doctor said.

697
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,048
He seemed to feel pretty strongly
that I'm sleep deprived.

698
00:41:39,854 --> 00:41:41,790
Yeah, so I told him all about you.

699
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:43,781
I bet you did.

700
00:41:43,906 --> 00:41:45,706
Yeah, told him everything.

701
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:47,740
You know what he said?

702
00:41:47,914 --> 00:41:49,564
Oh, I can only imagine.

703
00:41:49,722 --> 00:41:51,850
He said that,
"If I had a wife like that,

704
00:41:51,975 --> 00:41:54,472
I would sleep with her
every chance I got."

705
00:41:54,597 --> 00:41:57,905
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I know, that's what I thought.

706
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:00,215
So I said,
"What about the sleep deprivation?"

707
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,759
You know what he said?

708
00:42:01,884 --> 00:42:04,127
He said,
"That's why God invented naps."

709
00:42:04,252 --> 00:42:05,285
Really?

710
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,410
Really.

711
00:42:07,047 --> 00:42:09,006
I like this new doctor.

712
00:42:09,539 --> 00:42:11,331
So... so what are you saying?

713
00:42:11,456 --> 00:42:14,400
You want to come home with me tonight?
Maybe sleep together?
