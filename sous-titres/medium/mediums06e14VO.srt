1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,410
Happy birthday, baby.

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,000
Donald, honey?

3
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:14,420
Get up.

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,760
It's dinnertime, sweetie.

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,440
I sent the staff home early.

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,710
I thought maybe we could celebrate your birthday alone.

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,230
Wonderful.

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,660
There's food and champagne downstairs.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,630
But if you want to make a wish

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,270
and blow out your candles right here...

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,080
What do I have to wish for when I've already got you?

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,770
Oh, that's sweet, honey.

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,030
But the wax is dripping onto the cake.

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,850
Ooh, look at you in that dress.

15
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,560
What I wouldn't give to be 20 years younger.

16
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,310
Try 60.

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,220
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

18
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,140
I had a call from Dr. Carroll today.

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,060
He told me that the last

20
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,290
of the malignant cells in my prostate are gone.

21
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,360
It's a miracle, he said.

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,090
Someone my age, making a full recovery.

23
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,170
A full recovery? Yeah.

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,860
So... there's no chance the cancer's coming back?

25
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,600
Carroll didn't think so.

26
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,070
You know what I think made me better?

27
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,350
You.

28
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,810
It helps to have a young wife.

29
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,710
Who knows, the way I feel now,

30
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,610
I might just push for 100!

31
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,570
Sweetie pie, what are you doing?

32
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,460
I thought we were going downstairs.

33
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,590
We are. You are.

34
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,160
I'm sorry, Donnie.

35
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,050
But this isn't what I signed up for.

36
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,890
You weren't supposed to live this long.

37
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,530
Oh, my God.

38
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,070
Why won't you die already?

39
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,920
No.

40
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:18,130
medium 614

41
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,650
...following a one-day adjournment,

42
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,980
court will resume this afternoon

43
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,930
in the Mallory Kessinger trial.

44
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,540
Kessinger, as virtually every news outlet

45
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,900
in the country will tell you,

46
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,060
stands accused of murdering her billionaire husband,

47
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,530
J. Donald Kessinger, last August.

48
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,360
Come on, would you marry that guy for a billion dollars?

49
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,530
Would anyone marry that guy for a billion dollars?

50
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,830
Okay, enough talking, not enough eating.

51
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,060
Come on, guys. We're leaving in ten minutes.

52
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,930
Mommy's got a meeting with the district attorney,

53
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,820
and I can't be late.

54
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,140
Yeah, almost forgot.

55
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,390
I won't be home for dinner tonight.

56
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,960
I'm babysitting. For the Quinlans?

57
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,270
A friend of theirs.

58
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,570
Her name is, uh, Dr. Behrend.

59
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,820
I think she's a therapist or something.

60
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,410
And according to Mrs. Quinlan, if I do a good job,

61
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,950
this could turn into a regular thing.

62
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,800
Well, make sure we have her information.

63
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,160
Name, address, phone number.

64
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,830
And if I'm there past 8:00, I'll call.

65
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,390
...to murder her husband.

66
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,240
This video footage was taken while Mallory Kessinger

67
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,040
was vacationing in St. Bart's

68
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,530
just one week after her husband's death.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,660
What?

70
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,040
I'm taking an interest in your work.

71
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,230
Uh, I'm guessing this is yours?

72
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,560
Oh, thanks.

73
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,950
That kind of morning, you know?

74
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,070
I finally get an interview with the city planning department

75
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,980
and the lock on my briefcase gives.

76
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,570
Here's hoping I find the paper

77
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,540
that told me what floor I'm supposed to go to.

78
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,530
Well, I'm heading that way. I could show you.

79
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,100
Oh, thanks, but I think I still have some things

80
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,060
I have to collect.

81
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,100
Maybe, if I'm very lucky,

82
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,150
I won't have to crawl under any cars to get them.

83
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,280
Wow, how did you beat me up here?

84
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,760
And what happened to your vest?

85
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,690
Oh, don't tell me you had to crawl under those cars.

86
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,760
Manny, I'm only interested

87
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,890
in what's best for my client

88
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,060
and what's best for my client

89
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,810
is for this whole ordeal to be over.

90
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,000
In fact, nothing would please Mrs. Kessinger more

91
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,660
than to be able to get on with the business

92
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,510
of grieving for her husband.

93
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,190
Hmm.

94
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,170
I'm sure she also wouldn't mind

95
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,540
getting her hands on the inheritance as well.

96
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,370
Well, since you mention it,

97
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,290
the fact that her assets are frozen while she's on trial

98
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,690
has proven to be an additional hardship.

99
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,350
But look, we've both been in that courtroom

100
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,480
for more than a week now.

101
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,190
We've both seen the way the jury is looking at my client.

102
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,570
They're captivated by her.

103
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,500
They're not going to send her to prison.

104
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,040
Face it, Manny.

105
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,330
It's time to cut your losses.

106
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,040
Make a deal.

107
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,820
If your offer does not include

108
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,340
the charge of first-degree murder,

109
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,830
we don't have anything to talk about.

110
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,330
Come on, Manny.

111
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,510
There are no witnesses to this so-called murder.

112
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,090
Your whole case comes down to some forensics guy

113
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,080
who's willing to testify

114
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,070
the blow to the head of Mr. Kessinger

115
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:32,120
was not the result of his unfortunate fall down the stairs.

116
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,780
Well, guess what?

117
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,100
I got a forensics guy, too.

118
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,160
And he's gonna say the exact opposite.

119
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,890
I'll take my chances. Really?

120
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,480
Are you that sure you're in the catbird seat here?

121
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,860
I mean, I haven't put Mallory

122
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,840
on the stand yet.

123
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,170
When I do, believe me,

124
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,610
the jury will see that she was the very definition

125
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,780
of a loving wife.

126
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,650
She gave Donald Kessinger the best 14 months of his life.

127
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,340
Fourteen and a half.

128
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,410
Uh-huh.

129
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,300
All right,

130
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,730
sorry we couldn't work anything out.

131
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,380
I'll see you back in court.

132
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,450
Impressions?

133
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,050
???aa

134
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,030
I mean, I think if he was 40 years older

135
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,770
and a billion dollars richer,

136
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,540
they would make a perfect couple.

137
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,470
Sir...

138
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,760
What is that man doing in your office?

139
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,160
Oh, him?

140
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,130
He's tech support. Apparently, there's

141
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,600
some sort of glitch in the municipal mainframe

142
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,960
that's got a lot of the computers

143
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,420
in the building acting buggy.

144
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,530
Why?

145
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,300
Because I ran into him this morning in the parking garage.

146
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,580
You know, he told me that he was interviewing for a job

147
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,160
with the city planning department.

148
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,660
Okay, so, maybe he was.

149
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,210
Yeah, but he keeps changing his clothes.

150
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,090
That's the third outfit I've seen him in today.

151
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,440
Uh, there's no law against that.

152
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,570
Yeah, but it's weird.

153
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,550
Okay, let's see, uh...

154
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,340
What else?

155
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,700
You've got all my numbers.

156
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,530
You know when and what Jeb's supposed to eat.

157
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,370
Uh, I think we've pretty much covered it all.

158
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,470
You have nothing to worry about, Dr. Behrend.

159
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,750
Jeb is in good hands.

160
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,670
Real quick, uh, before I go,

161
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,960
in the interest of full disclosure, Jeb can be

162
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,480
a little bit of a handful.

163
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,560
Especially when it comes to sitters.

164
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,260
And that's why I'm going to pay you double

165
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,550
whatever the Quinlans pay you.

166
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,850
Wow, um, okay.

167
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,090
But Jeb doesn't look like a handful at all.

168
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,050
Yeah, don't fall for that.

169
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,960
He'll eat you alive.

170
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,290
Seriously?

171
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,370
Just keep an eye on him.

172
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,560
Oh, and if he does do something bad,

173
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,230
do not let him convince you that it was Mr. Teefers.

174
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,750
He's Jeb's imaginary friend.

175
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,780
He's a beaver.

176
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,090
About yea high, big teeth.

177
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,300
He gets blamed for a lot around here, if you know what I mean.

178
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,570
Isn't that right, Jebby?

179
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:58,890
Anyway.

180
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,200
I'll be gone a few hours,

181
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,750
and you have my cell phone if you need me, okay?

182
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,560
Okay.

183
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,310
Bye-bye, sweetheart.

184
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,540
Be a good boy for Mama, okay?

185
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,820
She's begging you.

186
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,500
So, Jeb. What do you, uh...

187
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,150
what do you say we play outside before it gets too dark?

188
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:35,850
What do you say?

189
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,380
What was that, Mr. Teefers?

190
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,310
You think that sounds like a lot of fun?

191
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,040
He's not there.

192
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:48,750
He's not?

193
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,360
Well, then, where is he?

194
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,790
Did you hear anything at work

195
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,230
about our voting district changing?

196
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,450
No, why?

197
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,850
I got an e-mail from the city that says it moved.

198
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,680
Sort of a weird time of the year to tell us, though.

199
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,670
I mean, there's not gonna be another election

200
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,890
for what, ten months?

201
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,400
Well, Devalos mentioned something about

202
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,360
there being a glitch in the municipal mainframe today.

203
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,910
Maybe that e-mail went out before it was supposed to.

204
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,950
Oh, shoot, my computer's about to die.

205
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,290
I'm still downloading these specs from Keith.

206
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,360
Could you grab my power cord?

207
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,120
It's in the dining room in my briefcase.

208
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,710
Honey, honey, can you come here now?!

209
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,810
What's going on? There's a man outside.

210
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,130
He's walking a dog. He's wearing a dress.

211
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,900
I think he's following me.

212
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,930
I saw him three times at work today.

213
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,900
Each time he was wearing something different.

214
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:07,830
Different dress?

215
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,180
No. It's the first time I've seen him in a dress.

216
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,450
The dress thing is new.

217
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,330
I don't know what to tell you.

218
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,800
Maybe he's changing into a pantsuit or something.

219
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:16,720
Look, I'm telling you.

220
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,140
There was a man out there.

221
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,580
He was walking a dog and wearing a dress.

222
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,360
He's been following me all day.

223
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,380
Allison, you work for the district attorney's office.

224
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,310
It's not like anybody can just wander around in there.

225
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,320
Well, this guy does. Sort of.

226
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,230
I mean, he fixes computers or something.

227
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,790
Well, so he's not really a stranger.

228
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,330
I mean, I-I bet if you ask around work tomorrow

229
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,880
you can probably find out who he is.

230
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,390
I guess so.

231
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,980
But I've never seen him before today.

232
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,090
Well, for all we know, he could live in the neighborhood.

233
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,220
I mean, maybe you seeing him now,

234
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,700
that could just be a big coincidence.

235
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,290
No. Maybe.

236
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,480
I don't know. It's dark.

237
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,740
It's a pretty good distance from here to the sidewalk.

238
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,190
You know, maybe he's wearing a billowy coat or something

239
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,780
and your eyes are playing tricks on you.

240
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,870
A billowy coat?

241
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,870
I'm just trying to find a logical explanation

242
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,940
so I back to checking my e-mail. Your e-mail.

243
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,280
Okay, go back and check your e-mail.

244
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,810
Please, don't do this!

245
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,930
You've gotta believe me.

246
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,770
I'm begging you.

247
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,550
I didn't take anything

248
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,410
from you!

249
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,950
I'm just as much a victim in this as you are!

250
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,160
I'm going to ask you just one more time.

251
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,710
You tell me what I want to hear,

252
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,820
and you come out of this with nothing more than a severe limp.

253
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,820
Where is my money?

254
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,210
Please, Charlie.

255
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,330
I didn't take it.

256
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,710
I'd give you my own money, but that's all gone, too!

257
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,000
Please. You have to believe me.

258
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,420
I'm begging you, please.

259
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,650
I got good news for you, old buddy.

260
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,280
Looks like you're not going to have to worry

261
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,300
about that limp after all.

262
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,300
Charlie...

263
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,290
You okay?

264
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,720
Yeah, just a weird dream.

265
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,670
That guy that I saw outside the window was in it.

266
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,780
Wait a second.

267
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,470
Now you're dreaming about this guy?

268
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,960
Mmm.

269
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,910
Al, please, for your sake, for my sake...

270
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,980
you gotta find a way to get this guy out of your head.

271
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,480
Al, what the hell are you doing?

272
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,470
Where's my husband?

273
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,130
What did you with him? Al, your husband?

274
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,450
What the hell are you talking about?

275
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,130
Where is he?! Tell me where he is now!

276
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,290
Mom?

277
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,750
What do you think you're doing?

278
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,260
Why are you pointing that at Dad?

279
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:32,950
Step back.

280
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,250
Ariel, look at him.

281
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,090
This man is not your father.

282
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,290
Dad, what is she talking about?

283
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,630
Why is she acting this way?

284
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,290
No, Mommy! I don't care if you guys are fighting.

285
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,170
You can't hurt Daddy.

286
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,290
I don't understand.

287
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,260
Why are you protecting this man?

288
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,150
Why do you keep calling him Daddy?

289
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,510
Because that's who he is: our dad,

290
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,870
and we're not going to let you hurt him.

291
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,710
It wasn't easy, but everyone's calmed down

292
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,010
and getting ready for school.

293
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,390
The official story is, you had a whopper of a nightmare

294
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,750
and woke up pretty confused.

295
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,100
Okay.

296
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,730
Once more with feeling.

297
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,290
My name is Joe Dubois.

298
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,680
You and I got married on the beach

299
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,720
in San Luis Obispo, California.

300
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,720
It was beautiful,

301
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,840
even though it happened a day after it was supposed to.

302
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,480
We tell people that's probably the weekend Ariel was conceived,

303
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,570
although we both know you were about five weeks pregnant

304
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,470
when we got married.

305
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,230
For the last time, Al, I'm your husband.

306
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,360
When our daughters look at me, they see your husband.

307
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,500
Something's going on with you, obviously.

308
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,330
It might be obvious to you, but...

309
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,610
Joe...

310
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,400
when I look at you, I still just see a stranger.

311
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,600
Okay.

312
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,500
Well, is he better-looking than the real me?

313
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,170
It's not funny.

314
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,520
What are you doing anyway?

315
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,550
What does it look like I'm doing?

316
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,600
I'm getting on with my day.

317
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,780
Look, this is definitely weird.

318
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,470
But you're not in danger.

319
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,320
And now that you aren't pointing

320
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,890
a pair of scissors at me anymore, I'm not in danger.

321
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,320
So let's just ride it out.

322
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,820
Temperature's up to an unseasonably warm 78 degrees.

323
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,590
So you can leave your jackets at home today, folks.

324
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,290
Dan?

325
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,450
Thanks, Ted.

326
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,380
The governor returned to Phoenix today,

327
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,520
insisting that his trip to Washington doesn't mean

328
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,500
he's interested in a run at a higher office...

329
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,130
Okay, those guys on TV right now--

330
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,720
they both look like you.

331
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,100
All those people that I saw yesterday,

332
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,900
they all look exactly like you do now.

333
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,360
I mean, I know I wasn't looking at the same guy.

334
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,450
They were different people.

335
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,900
I just... I just couldn't recognize them

336
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:52,880
for who they were.

337
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,790
So, everyone looks like me?

338
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,900
Like this to you now?

339
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,400
Well, no, not everyone.

340
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,020
No, not the girls.

341
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,300
Not my boss.

342
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,730
Not that lawyer I met with yesterday.

343
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,330
I don't get it.

344
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,990
Why do some people look different

345
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,580
and some people don't?

346
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,830
In other news,

347
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,580
the corpse of an apparent murder victim

348
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,060
was found in a patch of forest near Chandler

349
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,880
that's being cleared for a housing development.

350
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,230
Authorities have yet to identify the man,

351
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,990
but evidence at the scene suggests

352
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,570
that he was chased through the woods and shot several times.

353
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,040
Oh, my God, I had a dream about that murder last night.

354
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,080
Oh, yeah? Did you see the guy who did it?

355
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,150
Yeah, I saw him as clear as day.

356
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,060
I saw the victim, too.

357
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,350
They both looked...

358
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,780
a lot like you.

359
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,230
The body appears to have been shot several times.

360
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,130
It was found early this morning by an indigent man.

361
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,990
It was about 6:00 a.M.

362
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,100
He was out walking his dog...

363
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,210
Hey, what are you doing here?

364
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,380
Lee, is that you?

365
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,980
Uh, yeah, is there someone else you think I might be?

366
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,880
Just don't worry about it.

367
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,430
I'm just having a very weird morning.

368
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,450
This murder--

369
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,080
I dreamt about it last night--

370
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,320
sort of.

371
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:29,690
Okay.

372
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,710
We know the victim's name is Peter Musgrove,

373
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,030
but if you happened to get a look at the shooter...

374
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,210
I did and I didn't.

375
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,840
But I actually saw some things I think could be useful.

376
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,630
The victim and the murderer knew each other.

377
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,750
They-they were arguing about money.

378
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:43,960
And the guy who got shot

379
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,420
kept calling the other guy Charlie.

380
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,190
Charlie. That's a start.

381
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,320
Anything else?

382
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,560
Nothing that-that you could use.

383
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,900
Peter! Peter!

384
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,770
Peter!

385
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,930
We I.D.'d the victim from a fingerprint check.

386
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,080
Looks like his wife just got here.

387
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,770
Handsome woman.

388
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,470
Hey, Jeb, do you want your sandwich cut in half

389
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,340
or just regular?

390
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,660
Cut in half, please.

391
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
One late afternoon snack coming right up.

392
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,790
Oh, my God, what are you doing?!

393
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,960
That's my history book!

394
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,290
My take-home quiz-- you ruined it!

395
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,540
MAN : Doesn't it just break your heart?

396
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,880
Deep down he wants to be good,

397
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,270
but he just can't help himself sometimes.

398
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,810
You scared me.

399
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,590
You're still scaring me.

400
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,080
Yeah, well...

401
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,890
you scared me yesterday, so I guess we're even.

402
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,470
I scared you?

403
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,390
Sure.

404
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,880
I'm not used to anyone but Jeb being able to see me,

405
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,800
so I guess you're, uh, special

406
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:56,780
like he is.

407
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,440
Who are you?

408
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,950
Who do you think I am?

409
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,740
I don't know.

410
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,220
Some dead guy in a beaver costume?

411
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,210
Not just any dead guy

412
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,210
in a beaver costume.

413
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,230
You ever hear of Ashmore University?

414
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,010
Yeah. You ever watch

415
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,570
one of their football games on TV?

416
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,400
The Beavers-- the Ashmore Beavers.

417
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,570
We finished eight and four this year.

418
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,620
I am the Ashmore Beaver.

419
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,790
Or was.

420
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,230
Dressed up like this for games.

421
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,550
Got the crowd going.

422
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,520
Or used to, anyway.

423
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,000
I climbed on top of the scoreboard

424
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,570
during the homecoming game this year.

425
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,670
Fell off and broke my neck.

426
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,140
Oh, I'm...

427
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,410
uh, I'm sorry.

428
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,290
Did you die while you had the costume on?

429
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:43,960
Yeah.

430
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,990
Of course, never having been dead before,

431
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,790
I didn't realize how things worked.

432
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,760
Like, you know, I died in this costume,

433
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,560
so now I'll be stuck in it forever.

434
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,160
Okay.

435
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,040
What are you doing here?

436
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,270
I mean, did you know Jeb while you were alive or something?

437
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,680
Just sort of crossed paths one day.

438
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,610
Realized he could see me.

439
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,350
He thought I was one of those, you know, magical creatures.

440
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,520
So I hammed it up a little bit.

441
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,930
Starting talking like that stupid dinosaur on TV.

442
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,350
: Hey, Jeb, I'm your friend Mr. Teefers.

443
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,330
: Like that.

444
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,300
Turns out the kid could use my help,

445
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,730
so I decided to hang around for a while--

446
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,530
pretend to be his imaginary friend.

447
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,760
I give him advice sometimes,

448
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,270
try to keep him on the straight and narrow.

449
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,960
Honestly, it works out for both of us.

450
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,230
I get pretty lonely sometimes.

451
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,980
Look, I'm sorry if I'm weirding you out.

452
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,620
It's just you seem nice.

453
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,460
So I wanted to warn you about Jeb.

454
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,340
Uh...

455
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,440
Kid's got more issues than a newsstand.

456
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,490
Seriously, if I were you,

457
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,150
I'd find myself a new babysitting gig

458
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,070
before he Krazy-Glues my hands together.

459
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,350
He did that, you know.

460
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,270
Two sitters ago. Not pretty.

461
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,550
I can't... I mean, I can't just leave now.

462
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,550
I already promised his mom that I'd stay and help out all week.

463
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,640
I'm supposed to drive him to school tomorrow

464
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,830
and then pick him up.

465
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,280
She can't find anyone to replace me now.

466
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,050
Well, you do what you have to do,

467
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,240
but, honestly, I don't see things working out.

468
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,680
Jeb can be a real handful when he doesn't like someone.

469
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,850
And that stuff about your homework, trust me,

470
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,440
that's not even close to the worst he can do.

471
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,840
So you think this trial's

472
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,130
actually going to wrap up tomorrow?

473
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,600
I don't know. Devalos seems to think so.

474
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,480
He doesn't think that Mallory's lawyer

475
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,550
will actually put her on the stand.

476
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,600
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

477
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,240
Do what?

478
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,460
This.

479
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:37,760
Oh.

480
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,380
You want me to sleep in the living room?

481
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:41,740
You would do that?

482
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,030
I'm not happy about it, but sure.

483
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,900
I'm your husband.

484
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,950
I know this will pass.

485
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,850
No, wait a second.

486
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,570
No, don't. Just stay.

487
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,210
But do me a favor.

488
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,450
Will you check my e-mail before you shut that thing down?

489
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,720
Devalos said that the computers

490
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,970
at the office aren't working.

491
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,000
You have one new e-mail from the city of Phoenix.

492
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,010
"Your voting district has changed?"

493
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,610
Come on. Didn't we already get this e-mail?

494
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,480
Just delete it.

495
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:24,890
What?

496
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,180
Nothing. It's just the kids are all asleep.

497
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,780
It might be a good time for a little adult swim.

498
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,440
Are you serious? Come on.

499
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,640
Isn't it bad enough that I'm in bed with someone

500
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,080
who looks like a stranger?

501
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,400
Do you think I'm really gonna compound that felony

502
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,900
by actually sleeping with you?

503
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:41,840
Are you sure?

504
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:42,730
Might be kinda fun.

505
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,850
We are still in the same room.

506
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,770
Don't push your luck.

507
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,200
I knew we agreed on 100,000,

508
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,140
but you know, I'm the one taking all the risk here.

509
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,890
And I gotta be honest with you, I'm starting to get cold feet.

510
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,240
Look, what I'm doing for you, it's a pretty unique service.

511
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,860
I figure it's worth $200,000.

512
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,670
Excellent. I'm glad you agree.

513
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,110
Excuse me.

514
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,680
You're gonna have to wrap up your call now.

515
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,840
The recess is over. You need to return to the jury box.

516
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,630
Don't worry. You just bought yourself an acquittal.

517
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,000
What do you mean, they all look the same?

518
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,080
They all look like him. They all look

519
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,350
like the man I've been seeing.

520
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,540
Every single one of 'em.

521
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,010
Look, I know how crazy this sounds. Do you?

522
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,130
Look, in my dream, one of the jurors

523
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,230
was negotiating a bribe: $200,000

524
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,610
for an acquittal in this case.

525
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,810
Allison, I don't know what to do with that.

526
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,390
Talk to the judge.

527
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,230
The case has been compromised.

528
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,790
So you say, but I'm about to make my closing argument.

529
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,270
Now if you could identify the juror you saw,

530
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,420
maybe I could make a case

531
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,900
for an investigation of that person,

532
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,920
but barring that, I'm afraid my hands are tied.

533
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,050
Hello.

534
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,810
Hey, it's Lee.

535
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,590
Thought you'd want to know we just arrested someone

536
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,090
for the murder of Peter Musgrove.

537
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,370
Was his name Charlie?

538
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,790
Charlie Boller-- Peter Musgrove's brother-in-law.

539
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,220
And get this: Charlie's got a history.

540
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,800
He already assaulted this guy once last year.

541
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,480
We got him dead to rights, and he knows it.

542
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,700
He's copping a plea.

543
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,850
So listen, given you're the one who put us onto him,

544
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,800
I thought you might want to sit in

545
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,940
while I take his statement.

546
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,140
Allison, you still there?

547
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,790
Yeah. Sorry.

548
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,940
Um, hey, do me a favor.

549
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,130
When I get there, can you make sure

550
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,280
you're wearing your badge?

551
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,530
I'm having... some trouble with faces today.

552
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,180
Okay, last stop: preschool.

553
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,260
Everybody out.

554
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,670
Mom told me that after this week,

555
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,850
you won't be babysitting me anymore.

556
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,730
But I don't want you to go.

557
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:08,970
I like you.

558
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,260
Sure you do.

559
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,750
Why else would you ruin my homework

560
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,110
and tear up my textbook?

561
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,720
Is that why you're quitting?

562
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,730
Because Mr. Teefers told me to play a joke on you?

563
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,170
What are you talking about?

564
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,810
What do you mean Mr. Teefers told you to play a joke on me?

565
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,650
He tells me to do a lot of stuff.

566
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,340
I try to tell people

567
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,870
when Mr. Teefers tells me to do things,

568
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:35,950
but they never believe me, Mom especially.

569
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,390
She just cries.

570
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,240
I gotta go now.

571
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,240
I told you to find yourself a new gig.

572
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,830
I tried to be nice about it, but you wouldn't listen.

573
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,590
So now? No more Mr. Nice Beaver.

574
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,780
No more Mr. Nice Beaver?

575
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,080
Jeb doesn't need you, okay?

576
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,090
I'm his friend, not you.

577
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,290
If you're his friend,

578
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,400
then why do you keep getting him into so much trouble?

579
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,060
A few weeks before I died, my girlfriend broke up with me.

580
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,840
We'd been together since our freshman year in high school.

581
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,290
When I asked her why, she said her therapist thought

582
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,210
I'd become a domineering influence,

583
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,570
that she needed to get away from me

584
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,190
to find out who she really was.

585
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,020
I don't understand.

586
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,110
What does any of that have...?

587
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,880
Jeb's mother is a therapist.

588
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,510
Was she treating your girlfriend?

589
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,030
Are you seriously using her five-year-old

590
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,100
to get back at her?

591
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,400
Hey, what can I say?

592
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,240
Once a domineering influence, always a domineering influence.

593
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,960
You happen to notice those bags under her eyes?

594
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,810
All me, baby.

595
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,560
She hardly even sleeps these days

596
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,210
'cause she's so worried about what Jeb might get into.

597
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,560
Someone's waving at you.

598
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:23,840
Yeah, that's him.

599
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,800
That's my brother-in-law, Peter Musgrove.

600
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,330
And yeah, I'm the one who killed him.

601
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,310
I'm not denying it.

602
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,760
A bullet in the brain. Any particular reason

603
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,220
or are you just finishing what you started a year ago

604
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,200
when you assaulted him?

605
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,790
I didn't assault him. I beat the crap out of him.

606
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,390
He stole some checks from me.

607
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,830
Went out and bought himself a lot of expensive things.

608
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,040
I told him I'd kill him if he ever did it again.

609
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,500
Couple days ago, I get a call from the phone company.

610
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,000
They say my last check bounced.

611
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,330
I tell them that's impossible.

612
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:49,500
They don't want to listen.

613
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,010
So I get on the phone with my bank.

614
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,200
They say there's a reason the last check didn't clear.

615
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,140
They say I logged onto my account that morning,

616
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,680
transferred every penny I had to some account offshore.

617
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,810
Thing is, I hadn't been on my online account in weeks.

618
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,610
Are you saying your

619
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,560
brother-in-law cleaned you out? He was always messing

620
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,630
with my computer every time he and my sister came over.

621
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,200
He hacked me or something.

622
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,790
So I loaded up my rifle, went to pay him a visit.

623
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,200
He swore it wasn't him,

624
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,020
that the same exact thing had happened to him;

625
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,920
his bank account had been cleared out, too.

626
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,780
I didn't believe him, so I shot the dumb son of a bitch.

627
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:18,910
Joke was on me, though

628
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,280
'cause I found out the very next day

629
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,190
everything Peter was telling me was the truth.

630
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,190
What? My sister called,

631
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,210
asked me if I'd seen him.

632
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,030
She was a wreck.

633
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,260
She thought he'd run off on her because-- get this--

634
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,940
their bank accounts had been wiped out

635
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:32,940
Just like Peter said.

636
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,120
But couldn't he have

637
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,110
cleaned out those accounts?

638
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,940
Maybe he really was planning on leaving your sister.

639
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,200
He knew I'd kill him if he left.

640
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,200
Besides, later that day, I had a friend of mine

641
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,250
take a look at my computer,

642
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,130
see if he could figure out what had happened with my money.

643
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,730
He said it was all because of an e-mail I got from the city.

644
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,980
Something about my voting district changing.

645
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,880
Turns out the e-mail was a fake.

646
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,800
When I opened it, I downloaded something

647
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,780
called spyware onto my hard drive.

648
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:54,880
And just like that,

649
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,610
the guy who sent it had access to all of my information:

650
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,900
my credit card statements,

651
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,320
my PIN numbers, my social.

652
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,890
It was easy for him to make the bank think he was me.

653
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,840
He had all the numbers. He was me.

654
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:06,790
He was you.

655
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,080
That e-mail you opened--

656
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,240
you said it was about voting districts?

657
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:11,950
I opened one of those.

658
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,160
Of course you did.

659
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,600
Keep an eye on this guy.

660
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,550
Hey. Where you going?

661
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,050
What do you mean, "Of course you did"?

662
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,500
The last few days, I've been seeing this face

663
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,080
almost everywhere I go. I see it when I look at Joe.

664
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,850
I saw it on those men in there.

665
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,180
I see it when I look at you.

666
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,210
And now I think I'm finally starting to understand why.

667
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,680
I think it's the face of the man

668
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,220
who's been sending out those e-mails

669
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,170
telling everyone that their voting district has changed.

670
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,300
He's an identity thief.

671
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,530
That's why when I look at you or I look at Joe, I see him.

672
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,740
Because he's taken your identities.

673
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,820
Considering how often I've been seeing him lately,

674
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,260
he must have done it to hundreds,

675
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,420
maybe even thousands of people.

676
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,850
I look like who now?

677
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,170
Look, Lee, just trust me.

678
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,270
Do what I'm doing.

679
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,460
Go to your bank. Talk to somebody.

680
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,460
Maybe we could stop him from taking anything else.

681
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,140
Hi, you've reached Joe Dubois.

682
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,010
Please leave your name and number and I'll call you back.

683
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,810
Hey, honey, it's me again.

684
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,850
Look, I just want to let you know

685
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,920
I just put our credit cards on hold.

686
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,670
Sorry to leave so many messages.

687
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,010
Just... I'm at the bank.

688
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,230
Call me when you get this, okay?

689
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:36,490
Hey! Hey, stranger.

690
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,330
Uh! Long time no see.

691
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,740
It's you.

692
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,420
It's the real you.

693
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,390
I can finally see you.

694
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,400
I guess this craziness is finally over.

695
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,000
Did you get my message?

696
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:49,740
Is that why you're here?

697
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:50,860
Sorry. Do I know you?

698
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,750
Thanks again for your patience, Mr. Dubois.

699
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,610
If I could just get your signature,

700
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,240
we can complete the wire transfer

701
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,260
for your new account.

702
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,120
Wire transfer? What are you talking about?

703
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,410
Honey, why are you transferring our mon...?

704
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,750
It was easy for him

705
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,250
to make the bank think he was me.

706
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,040
He had the numbers. He was me.

707
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,030
You're him, aren't you?!

708
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,710
You're the man who's been sending out all those e-mails!

709
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,790
When I've been looking at Joe, I see you.

710
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,200
And now that you're here, pretending to be Joe, I see him.

711
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,090
You're the identity thief.

712
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,050
Sir, this man's not my husband.

713
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,060
Hey! Stop him!

714
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,980
So this is the man whose face you've been seeing everywhere?

715
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,760
The actual man? ALLISON: That's right.

716
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,260
Well, how can you be so sure of that?

717
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,720
If everyone looks like this man to you, it's...

718
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,600
Well, that's over now.

719
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,110
The only time I see his face now is

720
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,820
when I see him, the real him.

721
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,190
We checked the guy out.

722
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,330
Turns out his name's Fred Rovick,

723
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,760
and he does have a record-- not long, but colorful.

724
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,840
Way back in the '80s, he got arrested for hacking

725
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,540
his way behind an IRS firewall and erasing his dad's tax bill.

726
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,540
This is when he was a sophomore in high school.

727
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,220
Turns out a felony conviction makes it difficult

728
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,780
????ff

729
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,850
to land a gig with the big software firms,

730
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,310
so Fred's had a tough go of it.

731
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,630
Spent the last couple years fixing computers

732
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,720
with the Brain Brigade.

733
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,020
You know, those guys who come over to your place

734
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,950
and fix your computer for 25 bucks an hour?

735
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,200
Yeah, I've heard of them.

736
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,630
My wife used them to help set up our wireless network at home.

737
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,020
Well, turns out Fred meets a lot of wives

738
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,370
while he's out doing his job.

739
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,220
His, uh, manager told us over the past six months or so

740
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,600
that Fred's been going on a bunch of maintenance calls

741
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,180
for one client, in particular:

742
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,210
a woman by the name of, uh, Mallory Kessinger.

743
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:43,950
Mallory Kessinger?

744
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,800
The woman I'm prosecuting?

745
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,150
He wasn't just working for her.

746
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,830
According to his manager at the Brain Brigade,

747
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,560
he's been bragging about the big game he bagged

748
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,450
up at the Kessinger estate.

749
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,120
They're lovers.

750
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,320
I think he may be the-the person who's attempting

751
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,480
to pay off that juror to make sure that Mallory's acquitted.

752
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,430
Okay. Wait a second.

753
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,160
Didn't you tell me that the juror was asking for $200,000?

754
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,070
Where does someone who works for the Brain Brigade

755
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,170
get a hold of that kind of money?

756
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,270
Oh, from us.

757
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,960
Every single computer that the city owns

758
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,860
has been acting weird the last few days.

759
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,650
We checked with the IT department.

760
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,620
They've been investigating the possibility

761
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,710
that it's not just some weird glitch.

762
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,450
They think they've been hacked,

763
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,730
that someone broke into the city mainframe

764
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,040
and used it to send out thousands of e-mails

765
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,300
telling everyone that their voting district had changed.

766
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,560
Oh, yeah. I got one of those.

767
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,660
I've just been too busy with this trial to open it.

768
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,710
Delete it.

769
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,250
Those e-mails are full of spyware.

770
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,470
Anyone who downloaded the attachment

771
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,700
with the map of the new districts

772
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,810
got, uh, software on their hard drive

773
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,190
that gave the hacker access to everything on their computer:

774
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,350
personal information, passwords, you name it.

775
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,560
You got to admit, it's a pretty good plan.

776
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,800
Official-looking e-mail from the city?

777
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,480
No one's gonna think twice about opening it.

778
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:56,940
I didn't.

779
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,850
I think that's why I've been seeing this guy everywhere.

780
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,750
Everyone who opened this e-mail,

781
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,790
everyone whose, uh, identity was stolen,

782
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,320
they all looked like Fred Rovick.

783
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:06,910
Look, sir,

784
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,710
the jury's still deliberating.

785
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,360
We need to tell the judge

786
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,120
that one of the jurors has been tampered with.

787
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,830
Maybe we can get her to-to declare a mistrial.

788
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,650
Based on what, exactly?

789
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,330
Look, I'm inclined to believe you both,

790
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,640
but even so, there's no proof,

791
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,170
nothing I can present to the judge.

792
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,200
I can't even tell her which juror is compromised.

793
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:31,840
Well...

794
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,420
I guess it's a moot point. I'm needed back in court.

795
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,410
The jury in the Kessinger case just came back.

796
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,170
What the hell did you say to Jeb?

797
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,600
Mr. Teefers.

798
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,220
Good. You're here.

799
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,710
Yeah, I'm here.

800
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,280
I'm here every night at 9:00.

801
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,540
That's when Jeb and I usually talk.

802
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,040
But tonight, he just ignored me.

803
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,390
He kept mumbling, "Go away."

804
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,340
What gives?

805
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,650
Yeah. Sorry.

806
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,660
But I don't think Jeb's going

807
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,400
to be paying much attention to you anymore.

808
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,600
Really?

809
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,070
I doubt that.

810
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,170
See, you might have said something to him

811
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,230
that will work in the short term,

812
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,000
but think about it. You can't outlast me.

813
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,970
I'm in this for eternity.

814
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,350
I can visit Jeb whenever and wherever I want.

815
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,560
And eventually...

816
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,750
he'll start listening again.

817
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,150
See, you're missing the point.

818
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,590
Come with me.

819
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,850
There's something I want to show you.

820
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:33,320
What is that?

821
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,810
What the hell is that?

822
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,380
You can rent one at a costume shop.

823
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,880
Cost all the money I earned this week,

824
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,690
but it was worth it, to get you out of Jeb's life.

825
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,130
Get me out of Jeb's life?

826
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,890
I don't know what you're talking about,

827
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,520
but I think I just figured out who I'm gonna mess with

828
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,890
after I get tired of Jeb's mom.

829
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,100
Hope you're ready to get it on, kid,

830
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,900
'cause you just made my list

831
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,790
of things to do.

832
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,590
After I put Jeb to bed,

833
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,090
: Mr. Teefers paid him a visit.

834
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,060
That stupid voice you do?

835
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,750
It was easy to imitate.

836
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,450
I told Jeb that I was going away.

837
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,930
That he wouldn't be seeing Mr. Teefers anymore.

838
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,070
He was sad, but I explained

839
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,540
that he was ready to be on his own.

840
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,200
And that there was one thing that he had to look out for.

841
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,980
Mr. Teefers' evil twin.

842
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,650
And I warned him

843
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,950
that he would be showing up

844
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,490
and trying to get him to do stuff,

845
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,860
but that Jeb should ignore him.

846
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,690
Until he goes away.

847
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,640
And he will go away.

848
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,140
You seriously think the kid's gonna buy that?

849
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,650
I'm gonna walk in there right now

850
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,620
and tell him I'm the real Mr. Teefers.

851
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,540
That one he saw earlier tonight?

852
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,420
That's the evil twin.

853
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,690
You could give it a shot.

854
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,640
But I wouldn't get my hopes up.

855
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,910
See, after our conversation,

856
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,520
I told him that we had to seal our pact.

857
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,190
And I had Jeb tie

858
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,260
a red ribbon around Mr. Teefers' wrist,

859
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,340
so that he'd be able to tell

860
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:12,400
whether he was talking to the real Mr. Teefers.

861
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:13,760
Come on.

862
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,310
Sucks, huh?

863
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,830
That the one thing that you can't change

864
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:20,970
is the way that you look.

865
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,740
So I guess you'll be moving along now.

866
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:27,980
You played me.

867
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,710
I can't believe you played me. What are you, like, 16?

868
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,780
You're already worse than that bitch therapist.

869
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:35,270
Leave.

870
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,320
Do something else.

871
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,860
Or go to wherever it is you're supposed to be heading

872
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,510
because there's nothing for you here.

873
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,230
Okay? Not anymore.

874
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:50,080
Now. I have Spanish homework.

875
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:59,950
Am I surprised that the jury declared itself

876
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,270
to be hopelessly deadlocked?

877
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,330
Yes and no.

878
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,210
Frankly, I was expecting the speedy acquittal

879
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,870
that my client deserves.

880
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,500
But at the end of the day,

881
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,440
a mistrial works in our favor, too.

882
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,390
Mallory Kessinger is walking home a free woman,

883
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,770
and that's clearly the most important thing.

884
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,390
Do you expect the district attorney

885
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,380
to refile charges against your client?

886
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,510
That would be a very foolhardy move indeed.

887
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,580
Mr. Devalos has had his day in court.

888
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,370
I think it's time for everyone to move on.

889
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,330
REPORTER 2: Mallory, do you have any comments?

890
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,740
Um...

891
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,520
I loved my husband.

892
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,950
I loved Donald,

893
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,550
and I miss him so, so badly.

894
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,560
I just hope everyone realizes that now.

895
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:48,340
200 grand to get access to a couple billion?

896
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,090
That'll be the best money she ever spent.

897
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,600
Well, she didn't even spend her own money.

898
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,040
She and her boyfriend stole it.

899
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:54,810
True.

900
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,420
But there is a bright side.

901
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,330
They didn't steal anything from us.

902
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,560
Thank goodness you showed up at the bank

903
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,130
before the transfer went through.

904
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,360
Hmm.

905
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,400
Coming to bed?

906
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,610
Well, you certainly are in an awfully good mood.

907
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,850
Well, the girls are asleep.

908
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,520
When you look at me, you no longer see Fred Rovick,

909
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,400
international man of mystery.

910
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:27,730
And I'm holding a certain rain check.

911
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,020
Hmm.

912
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,430
Come on.

913
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,160
I'm dying to cash this thing in.

914
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:52,940
Hmm. Hello?

915
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,860
FRED : Hey, Mallory.

916
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,530
How's the first day of the rest of your life going?

917
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:56,530
Freddy!

918
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,080
Going just fine.

919
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,650
Well, there is the occasional moment

920
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,750
where I do miss the late J. Donald.

921
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,630
But then I just go on the computer

922
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,750
and buy myself something.

923
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,550
And that helps me feel better.

924
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,260
Now, listen, Freddy.

925
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,220
I've been seeing your face all over the news

926
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,220
the past couple days.

927
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,090
I'm so sorry that the police figured out

928
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,650
you stole all those identities.

929
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,940
Yeah. Me, too.

930
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,070
Don't think I'll be back in Phoenix for a while,

931
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,540
or even the U.S.

932
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,380
Aww. I'm gonna miss you so, so much.

933
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,530
I'm so glad to get to hear your voice.

934
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:28,950
Mmm.

935
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:32,170
But, Freddy, listen, if you ever need anything...

936
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,880
maybe a loan to keep you afloat wherever you are ...

937
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,570
I'm only a phone call away.

938
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:39,120
Actually, Mallory, I'm pretty well set for money.

939
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:40,810
I've been working something else

940
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,870
since I went underground.

941
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,090
Well, I'm glad you're doing all right, Freddy.

942
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,120
But I'm gonna have to get off now, okay?

943
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,140
It's my late husband's business manager,

944
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,570
and I've been waiting for him to confirm

945
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,510
that the last of the assets are in my name now.

946
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,320
Sure. You go.

947
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,890
But the business guy's not calling

948
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,210
to tell you you're swimming in money.

949
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,130
He's calling to tell you you're dead broke.

950
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,670
That's not funny.

951
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,560
It's true, Mallory.

952
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,720
Every single penny is gone.

953
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,550
I cleaned you out.

954
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,090
See, I didn't like having to steal

955
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,280
from all those innocent people,

956
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,310
but I knew there was no other way

957
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,830
to get that juror in our pocket.

958
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,330
I needed you to get off

959
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,150
so you'd have access to your husband's money.

960
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,800
Then I'd have access to it, too.

961
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,920
You-You messed with my computer, too?

962
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,650
What did you think was gonna happen, Mallory?

963
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,090
You and me'd live happily ever after?

964
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:26,590
Couple billion dollars goes a long way where I am.

965
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,830
I'm feeling so flush

966
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,620
that I even returned the 200K I stole

967
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:32,790
from those poor working stiffs, plus 7% interest.

968
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,030
It only seemed right.

969
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,620
What about me? How the hell am I supposed to live?

970
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:37,940
You'll figure something out.

971
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,610
After all, you've still got your looks.

972
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:49,420
You okay?

973
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,100
Yeah.

974
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:52,570
Honey,

975
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,990
what is seven percent of $25,000?

976
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,720
It's a little over $1,700. Why?

977
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,670
Oh, nothing.

978
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,460
I'm just starting to wish

979
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,950
that Fred Rovick had been able

980
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,430
to get that money out of our account.

981
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,760
We could have come out ahead on the deal.
