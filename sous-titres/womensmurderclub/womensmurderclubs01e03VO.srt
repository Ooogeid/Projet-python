1
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,110
I thought we wake the
dead,not the other way around.

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,830
Damn it,I ordered extra caramel.

3
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,880
Did you change my coffee order again?

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,920
Yes,because that's not coffee.

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,740
That's diabetes on ice.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,440
- it's late.Carbs help me think.
- PerfecT.

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,320
Think on him.

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,910
Say hello to simon.He's an
E.M.T.Who works with luke.

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,230
He's holding a kitten.

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,350
Which he saved at the scene of a fire
along with a toddler and a senior citizen.

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,870
Oh,you're good.

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,140
You know I don't do blind dates.

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,840
Fine.You can tell him that
yourself when he calls.

14
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,500
You game him my number?

15
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,130
- Pimp.
- Nun.

16
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,090
okay,ladies,

17
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,040
here we go.

18
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,620
And I told you i'd be morehan happy to talk once
someone gets hospitable and brings me dinner.

19
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,730
I didn't ask to be on break.

20
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,540
What do u have?

21
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,380
One cranky hooker,a migraine,and,uh...

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,760
you want to get that for me over there?

23
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,590
She found her 30 minutes ago.

24
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,110
Ma'am,can you tell
us what happened here?

25
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,930
Y'all can just take a number until
I get some crab rangoon up in here.

26
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,440
Fantastic,right?

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,430
Jill bernhardt,D.A.'S office.

28
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,810
I had you in court a few years back.

29
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,360
You cut your hair.

30
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,250
- Looks nice,girl.
- Thanks.

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,610
Seem to remember we
settled on probation.

32
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,150
Now you're back on turk
street with god knows

33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,780
what kind of pipe in your purse.

34
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,040
Who's your P.O.Again?

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,260
- How can I help?
- You recognize her?

36
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,550
No,

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,940
but she's in the wrong
neighborhood,that's for sure.

38
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,410
Boys on this block
like their women bionic.

39
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,100
That one has all the parts
the good lord gave her.

40
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,850
Did you see anything
else,anyone in or out of here?

41
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,790
It's been a slow night.

42
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,030
All right.Let's get
her something to eat.

43
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,240
streets hadn't aged her yet.

44
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,850
I'd say she's almost pretty.

45
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,120
Whoever did this to her thought so,too.

46
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,300
He spared her face.

47
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,910
Bruising tells me the blow came
at least an hour before death.

48
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,430
Not a bobby pin out of
place.Her manicure's perfect.

49
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,530
No working girl I've ever met would
have gone down without a fight.

50
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,930
She was taken by surprise.

51
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,230
Lividity on the left
shoulder,arm and leg.

52
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,940
She didn't die in this position.

53
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,960
No,she was laying on her
side,maybe in a trunk or backseat.

54
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,040
I'll check clothes and hair for fibers.

55
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,520
Her right shoe's probably
fallen off in the john's car,too.

56
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,650
So what are you thinkin'?

57
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,500
Looks like a classic bump and dump.

58
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,000
Come on.You know me.Cindy
thomas,the "register."

59
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,680
Can you give me the
victim's name,age,a-anything?

60
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,150
Hi.I looked for a press
area,but there wasn't one.

61
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,580
That's because a prostitute slaying in
this part of town at 3:00 A.M.Isn't news.

62
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,010
Did you know tha the
crime desk assignment came

63
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,110
with a pepper spray key
chain and a police scanner?

64
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,940
It's like my new tivo.I
can't turn it off.

65
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,530
Cho,why are you
standing here socializing

66
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,890
when there's potential
evidence 3 feet behind you?

67
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,410
- Um...
- unless this is your purse,cho.

68
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,180
"Emily sherman."

69
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,910
I wonder what her working name was?

70
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,610
hello?

71
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,590
mom?

72
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,800
Where are you?

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,010

76
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,800
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,680
You probably have a lot of work to do.

78
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,390
I just can't leave her.

79
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,280
It's okay.Take your time,sweetie.

80
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,580
The only work we have,alexis,is
finding who did this to your mom.

81
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,040
Can I ask you a few questions?

82
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,130
When was the last time you saw her?

83
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,470
Before school,

84
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,120
but I talked to her
last night around 6:00.

85
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,300
She called me while I was at my
art class,totally freaking out.

86
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,280
Why?

87
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,610
She was going on her first
date in,like,five years.

88
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,910
I told her to raid my
closet.We shared everything.

89
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,390
Do you know who she was going out with?

90
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,410
I don't know.

91
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,140
When I was little,my mom
didn't want me to think that

92
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,220
every time she brought a
guy home I had a new dad,

93
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,720
so she kept her love life private.

94
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,220
Five years with no dates?

95
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,470
When she opened the bookstore,

96
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,060
she said that she didn't have the
time or energy to meet someone new.

97
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,150
That's understandable.

98
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,320
She was just hiding the
fact that she wasonely.

99
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,110
I was the one who
forced her to find somee,

100
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,380
get back in the game.

101
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,410
- Do you know where the date was?
- No.

102
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,870
She went to the gym first,though.

103
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,860
bay view fitness.

104
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,620
Can I go home now?

105
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,180
Actually,alexis,why
don't you come with me?

106
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,370
That's one impressive teenager.

107
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,910
Emily did a great job.Being
a mom is hard enough.

108
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,500
I can't imagine doing it alone.

109
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,800
All right.

110
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,020
The head injury wasn't lethal,but it
was violent enough to knock her out.

111
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,380
That's when the killer tied her up.

112
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,680
These abrasions are on her ankles,too.

113
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,200
I don't know what was used yet,

114
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,430
but I can rule out your garden-variety
rope and electrical cord.

115
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,510
Any signs of sexual assault?

116
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,730
- None.
- Cause of death?

117
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,840
She asphyxiated on whatever was
shoved in her mouth to keep her quiet.

118
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,690
I have no way of knowing what it was.

119
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,210
The killer took it with him.

120
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,670
So he's smart,knows
how to cover his tracks.

121
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,000
You didn't ask to get back
in the game,did you,emily?

122
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,490
You were very comfortable
on your couch,in your pajamas

123
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,170
with a good pinot watching
"prime suspect" on dvd.

124
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,820
Not that anyone is
speaking from experience.

125
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,970
We'll get him.

126
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,750
We need to contact your
father,let him know what happened.

127
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,970
Good luck.

128
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,300
The last birthday card I got
from him was postmarked vermont,

129
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,800
but that was three years ago.

130
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,100
Wait.He getting custody?

131
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,010
That's for the dependency
court to figure out.

132
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,300
Well,what about our
apartment and the bookstore?

133
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,150
I mean,that was her life.I
have to take care of it.

134
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,010
The trouble is,you're 17.

135
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,860
Legally,you can't be on your own.

136
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,890
Yeah,but I always stay by myself.

137
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,260
I mean,just ask my
mom.She'll tell you...

138
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,650
it's gonna be okay.

139
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,960
emily was my biggest success story.

140
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,550
In six months we had her down two
dress sizes,got her body mass to 18.5.

141
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,900
No one was more committed.

142
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,340
Committed enough to squeeze in one more
workout before her big date,we hear.

143
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,900
God,I kind of feel responsible.

144
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,340
Why is that,mr.Roberts?

145
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,990
Emily was feeling insecure.

146
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,780
She was having second thoughts
about going out,so I pushed her.

147
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,930
It's a trainer's job to get
people out of their comfort zone,

148
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,470
make them see they're capable of more.

149
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,240
but you didn't see
her leave with anyone?

150
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,530
No.

151
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,510
By that time,I was
busy with mrs.Hammond.

152
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,090
Not a success story.

153
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,530
In all that chitchat,emily sherman
never mentioned the name of her date?

154
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,630
She just called him her luvspace guy,

155
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,150
you know,after that singles
web site everyone uses?

156
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,950
- What?
- Tom and the feds requested that kiss me not stuff days ago,

157
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,250
and you know how I feel about clutter.

158
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:15,160
This clutter represents five years,one
failed marriage and a lot of sleepless nights.

159
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,620
- They'll get it when I'm ready.
- This was also in my work area.

160
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,190
That's my background check.

161
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,110
Who's simon?Suspect?

162
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,060
Person of interest?

163
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,300
Potential blind date.

164
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,950
Get quippy and you die.

165
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,220
Well,it's clean except for one thing.

166
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,900
There's a citation from the humane
society,something about a kitten?

167
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,310
- Damn it.
- I say go for it.

168
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,360
It'snly one date.

169
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,310
I'm gonna walk this off.

170
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,850
Oh! Lindsay.

171
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,280
We are not on a first-name
basis in public,miss thomas,

172
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,300
and I have nothing new for
you in the emily sherman case.

173
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,320
I'm not here about that.

174
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,530
I just wanted to make sure I didn't
get anyone in trouble last night,

175
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,120
'cause that sweet officer
cho was totally doing his job.

176
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,140
- Then why were you bothering him?
- I was doing my job.

177
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,960
If...and this is a big if...

178
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,740
we're going to have a relationship,we
need to set up some ground rules.

179
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,940
- Ready.
- Okay.

180
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,500
Rule number one... if it looks
like I'm too busy to talk,I am.

181
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,050
Where are we on the
luvspace.Biz subpoena?

182
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,500
The company claims releasing emily sherman's
chat logs compromises the entire site.

183
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,480
They've got the office of
privacy protection involved.

184
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,670
- The back and forth coultake weeks.
- I don't have that kind of time.

185
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,970
Then slip in through
another member's back door.

186
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,760
My friend hannah is
tech editor at the paper,

187
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,440
and when she found out
that I was on luvspace,

188
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,190
she taught me this trick so that I could access
the private sections of my dates' profiles...

189
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,510
you know,see what they said
about me after we went out,

190
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,730
see how many women they're chatting up.

191
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:35,460
I'd like to remind everyone that this trick is
really illegal and really,really inadmissible.

192
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,370
Hey,you're single.You
want your own profile?

193
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,880
- No.
- Couldn't hurt.

194
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,310
Need a picture?

195
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,070
Why is my relationship status a problem
that everyone feels they need to solve?

196
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,510
I'm not ready.

197
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,740
Of course you are.

198
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,010
Everyone said that to emily sherman,too.

199
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,070
I'm in.Okay,this is
where she lists her job,

200
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,090
likes,dislikes,what have you.

201
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,590
The site then runs that information through
a database and picks out potential suitors.

202
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,690
That's when the chatting begins,

203
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,210
and emily was pretty chatty.

204
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,960
It's gonna take me at least
a day to go through all these.

205
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,250
Let me see her last correspondence.

206
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,190
Jared mccarthy... nfirming
dinner the night of the murder.

207
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,490
He's a magazine editor.

208
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,730
He likes "walks in the
rain and michael bubl?"

209
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,230
How romantic.

210
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,950
look,I'm not interested in sharing
the freakin' good news,okay?

211
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,260
Mr.Mccarthy,I'm inspector boxer.

212
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,990
- This is inspector jacobi.
- Sorry.

213
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,050
The,uh,thumpers on this street
can be pretty persistent.

214
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,750
Uh,ahem,I was just trying
to get some painting done.

215
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,900
We'd like to ask you a few
questions about emily sherman.

216
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,390
You met her on luvspace.Biz.

217
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,910
- What about her?
- Throw on a shirt.We'll chat inside.

218
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,950
Actually,the place is
kind of a mess,so...

219
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,620
don't move.

220
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,170
hey,hey,stop! You can't go up there!

221
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,300
I'm a police officer.

222
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,570
And people wonder why I don't date.

223
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,440
I wasn't torturing her.

224
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,490
It was two consenting
adults doing a scene.

225
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,690
From what,"the seagull"?

226
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,430
Oh,thanks.She'll never call me again.

227
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,230
You've got bigger
problems.Emilsherman was murdered.

228
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,950
From what we hear,you
were the last to see her.

229
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,500
I never even met the chick,all
right?She stood me up.

230
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,050
- How can we verify that
- I don't know.

231
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,740
Try to think.

232
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,960
Because as I'm looking around,I'm reminded
that our victim was bound and gagged,

233
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,310
clearly something you like to do.

234
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,860
Talk to the maître d' at la luna.

235
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,710
He called me a cab,he
saw me leave alone.

236
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,120
- And after that?
- I came home and chatted online the rest of the night.

237
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:40,340
- Is that how you met our kinky dental hygienist?
- Her name is barbara,and yes.

238
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,420
Funny,I don't see pleather
on your list of likes.

239
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,600
I have profiles on more than one site.

240
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,090
Luvspace is for the nice girls.

241
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,880
Bindmeup is for the others.

242
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,720
It doesn't mean I killed anybody.

243
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,590
Look,all of those
chats are time-stamped.

244
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,070
I will print you a copy.

245
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,010
Did you give alexis sherman permission
to go home without a legal guardian?

246
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,260
She isn't alone,denise.

247
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,050
She's staying with a neighbor
while we look for her dad.

248
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,720
Right.Food stamp recipient
helen mctavish... age 81,cats,9.

249
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,250
Hardly an acceptable caretaker.

250
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,050
After her mother's grisly death,

251
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,720
staying with a family friend in familiar
surroundings was our best option.

252
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,180
The county is her parent in
absentia.You know the protocol.

253
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,330
She enters foster care today.

254
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,120
Denise,please.

255
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,710
The system will eat her alive.

256
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,340
Sad,but not this office's concern.

257
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,500
Can't you at least hold off
until her father is located?

258
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,160
Oh,i am not doing anything.

259
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,530
That woman may have a
law degree from stanford,

260
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,270
but her management style
is straight out of abu raib.

261
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,890
Mrs.Mctavish,I'm jill
bernhardt.May I speak with alexis?

262
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,550
Oh,I'm sorry,dear.

263
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,540
Alexis told me that the district
attorney was sending her home.

264
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,530
where is she?

265
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,600
lexis!

266
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,170
what do you think you're doing?

267
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,200
I wasn't gonna stay,I swear.

268
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,890
I just came to grab some stuff.

269
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,620
But when I walked in,I
could smell my mom's perfume.

270
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,100
You know,it was like she was here.

271
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,360
Alexis,I know you miss her,but it does
not mean you get to ignore the rules.

272
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,910
Fine.

273
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,340
I'll go back to mrs.Mctavish
and I'll apologize for lying.

274
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,160
I wish it were that easy.

275
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,190
The court won't approve
her as a guardian.

276
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,910
You're entering foster care today.

277
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,750
No way! Okay,I've heard
what those places are like.

278
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,690
Most of the kids I paint with down on
ortega are runaways from foster care.

279
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,150
I'm sorry.

280
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,160
Are you?

281
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,230
Do you have any idea
what you're doing to me?

282
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,340
We should pack a bag.

283
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,160
If you want,I can help you pick
out a few of your mom's things.

284
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,410
You've helped enough.

285
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,860
You the boyfriend?

286
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,700
Yeah.Milo.

287
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,780
Look,I-I know we're
not supposed to be here,

288
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,780
but she called me all hysterical,and I
didn't know...I didn't know what to do.

289
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,510
So I just brought over the
paint,and we got to work.

290
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,520
She was calming down till you showed up.

291
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,820
Something tells me her mother
wouldn't be too calm about all this.

292
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,140
Ms.Sherman would be down.

293
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,980
She loved me,and she always
wanted alexis to express herself.

294
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,290
And how long have you two been
expressing yourselves together?

295
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,670
A year.

296
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,340
Dude,this is surreal.

297
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,760
Only a few days ago,my
girl had a mom,a life.

298
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,780
She's going through
hell,milo.She's raw,emotional.

299
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,600
Her decisions will be,too,which means you need
to step up and be the calm voice of reason,'

300
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,020
cause we all want what's
best for alexis,right?

301
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,670
what did you find out
about the boyfriend?

302
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,290
Milo bishop,17,high school
dropout,up-and-coming graffiti artist.

303
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,020
Other than that,no criminal record.

304
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,960
They're gone.

305
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,990
Where are my boxes?

306
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,380
You don't keep the fbi waiting.

307
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,500
Those were my files.

308
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,380
Then why are they stamped
"property of S.F.P.D."?

309
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,900
The feds are trying
to solve a case,linz.

310
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,610
A case that I've been
working the past five years.

311
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,780
I'm the one who filled out
the profile on that monster.

312
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,640
I stared into the faces
of those poor women.

313
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,560
When this department refused to
cough up more money for D.N.A....

314
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,800
You paid for the tests yourself,I know.

315
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,380
I was the one who
balanced our checkbook.

316
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,560
Lindsay,this obsession
is costing you,a lot.

317
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,720
When was the last time
you took a vacation,hmm?

318
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,840
Or went to a movie,for pete's sake?

319
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,910
From what I hear,you're not even dating.

320
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,630
Can we be done?

321
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,230
And just so you know,i am dating...

322
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,880
simon,an amazing E.M.T.

323
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,420
Who loves me just the way
I am,obsessions and all.

324
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,970
Oh.

325
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,840
Well,good.

326
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,500
Not good,tom.

327
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,630
Bigger and better.

328
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,090
emily sherman's xiphoid
process was broken.

329
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,290
- Xi-what? - This piece
of cartilage right there.

330
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,050
It can snap when c.P.R.Is
administered incorrectly.

331
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,250
Ich means one of three things...

332
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,970
it was an accident,

333
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,140
our killer had second thoughts,or he
was just trying to prolong the terror.

334
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,170
Whatever it was,it's
not a pretty picture.

335
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,790
Aside from that,the body's clean...

336
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,620
no blood,D.N.A.,Nothing.

337
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,740
Wish I could give you more.

338
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,370
Actually,you can.

339
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:31,430
If tom asks,E.M.T.Simon and i have been
together forever,and we're completely in love.

340
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,470
So you lied.

341
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:36,580
Even my ex-husband is jumping on
the "lindsay needs a date" bandwagon,

342
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,940
and I had to exit his office
with some shred of dignity.

343
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,540
You know,

344
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,400
I didn't realize our matchmaking
efforts were upsetting you so much.

345
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,840
I just don't understand why it's
such a big deal for everybody.

346
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,190
Well,jill...

347
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,100
she's a bit of a busybody.

348
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:59,470
And in my case,I just think
I'm trying to live vicariously.

349
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,100
Through me?Please don't say that.

350
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,640
Lindsay,there's a gorgeous guy out
there who wants to get to know you,

351
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,110
maybe even sweep you off
your feet.It's exciting.

352
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,950
- It's not anything.
- Still,

353
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,260
you have options.

354
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,530
Some of us would kill for those.

355
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,790
What's going on at home,claire?

356
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,340
Nothing...

357
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,430
specifically,in the bedroom.

358
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,650
Okay,we've never actually
talked about this.

359
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,820
Is it difficult because of the...

360
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:40,970
- the wheelchair?
- Yeah.

361
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,080
- I mean,can ed...
- he can.

362
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,400
We just don'T.

363
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,890
We,who usually initiates?

364
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,640
Before the shooting,my
husband,always and everywhere.

365
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,680
Well,step up to the plate,sexy mama.

366
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,280
- Seduce the man.
- Oh,no,I can't do that.

367
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,670
And how did we go from the
autopsy report to my sad sex life?

368
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,360
It actually started with mine.

369
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,110
Feelg anxious?

370
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,110
It's completely normal.

371
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,150
Emergency foster placement
can be a little tricky,

372
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,740
but I think you'll be pleased
with the match we made.

373
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,690
Hey,alexis.

374
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,330
What are you doing here?

375
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,320
Taking you home.

376
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,620
My cooking could be
considered child abuse,

377
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:44,840
so our options are
chinese,pizza or clam land.

378
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,000
We'll skip that one.

379
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,440
So where's your boyfriend?

380
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,000
Who says I have a boyfriend?

381
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,920
There's aftershave in the pantry and
a bunch of suits stuffed under my bed.

382
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,890
So you're living in sin.

383
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,330
Who cares?

384
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:02,120
Your social worker,foone,but luke's
in chicago at a medical conference,

385
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,000
so technically,this week I'm single.

386
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,080
This was our tour of american authors...

387
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,910
mark twain's house,willa
cather's birthplace.

388
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:23,500
It's not the best vacation for a fifth
grader,but when your mom owns a bookstore...

389
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,490
I'm already having trouble
picturing what she looks like when I

390
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,010
close my eyes.

391
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,450
Do the memories go,too?

392
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,470
Some will.

393
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,100
Luckily,they come back
when you least expect it,

394
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:47,120
like finding a 20 in
your jeans on laundry day.

395
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,520
We reached your father.

396
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,260
He lives in florida now... tampa.

397
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,220
Is he coming to get me?

398
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,160
Not yet.

399
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,840
That's code for "he
doesn't want you," right?

400
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,420
He's remarried.His wife just had a baby.

401
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,570
They need more time to think it over.

402
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,100
Big deal.

403
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,290
Florida's a pit anyway.

404
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,310
Oh,we're not giving up.

405
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,380
Your endless optimism
is getting offensive.

406
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,550
I mean,why do you even care?

407
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,210
her father died when she was 8.

408
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,080
Her mom remarried a guy named billy.

409
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,830
Let's just say he wasn't much of a dad.

410
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,740
She ended up in the system for a while.

411
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,380
All that shuffling around was
tough,but she came out the other side.

412
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,500
That was me.

413
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,460
That's why I care.

414
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,720
We showed these to alexis and
the employees at emily's store.

415
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,570
No one can make an I.D.

416
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,060
She really chatted up this many guys?

417
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:11,540
The emily I knew got nervous if she had
to ask a man to share the lat machine.

418
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,340
Did she ever mention alexis' boyfriend?

419
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,560
Milo?

420
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,470
All the time.

421
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,780
- Fondly?
- Oh,she wasn't keen on him.

422
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,410
I don't know if it was
'cause he was a bad guy

423
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,760
or if he just reminded emily that
her little girl was growing up

424
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,450
and starting to pull away.

425
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,630
I know they fought about him,though.

426
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,280
Wait,I know him.

427
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,660
Bigstud4u?

428
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,890
His name's dino palley.

429
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,730
He was a member here
till we kicked him out.

430
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,520
He was cornering women on the
floor,getting inappropriate.

431
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,010
Did you ever see him
interact with emily?

432
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,200
That creep would interact
with anything with two legs.

433
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,170
Ooh,oysters,my favorite.

434
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,950
Aphrodisiac.

435
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,490
- Let's get a dozen.
- Sure,dino.

436
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,250
Nice top,by the way.

437
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,540
Thanks.

438
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,090
So have you met a lot
of women on the site?

439
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,190
A few.

440
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,570
Anybody recently?

441
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,510
let's not talk about them.

442
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,570
I'm just fascinated
by the whole process.

443
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,880
I mean,h-how do you
decide who to contact?

444
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,730
Is it by her looks,by her hobbies?

445
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,210
What was the last date you were on?

446
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,430
You keeping score or something?

447
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,530
No.

448
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,000
All right,maybe I am.

449
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,100
It's...it's... it's just intimidating.

450
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,120
I am on my first luvspace date,

451
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,740
and you're on your
what,70th or something?

452
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,640
How would you know that?

453
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,820
You're...you're just so natural at this.

454
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,380
Yeah,well,70's a pretty specific number.

455
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,970
You snooping around my account?

456
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,840
You spying on me?

457
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:44,180
Y-you have to
understand,I've had such...

458
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,650
bad luck in the past.

459
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,670
- Internet dating is scary.
- And I scare you?

460
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,980
Only because,dino,I...

461
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,200
I wanted you... I needed you...

462
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,320
to like me.

463
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,940
Now I see that I have betrayed your tru.

464
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,780
I should...I should go.

465
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,630
Hey.

466
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,600
Sit down.We'll start over.

467
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,570
Really?

468
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,240
Okay.

469
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,170
Uh,why don't you order
me a glass of red wine?

470
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,760
I'll be right back.

471
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,090
- boxer.
- before you get mad

472
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,860
that I did not check with you
first,this theory was a long shot.

473
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,610
- You could barely call it a hunch.
- Go on.

474
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,110
You know how I said that I would
sift through all of emily's chats?

475
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,510
Well,I did,and I discovered
that she had a "lurker,"

476
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,440
someone who contacted her once and
then checked her profile obsessively...

477
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,330
sort of like an online stalker.

478
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,270
So I sent him a message pretending
to be interested in a date,

479
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,190
we decided on dinner,and now I am
hiding in a restaurant busing station

480
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,100
- because he won't let me leave.
- What's his name?

481
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,860
Dino palley.

482
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,610
Where is he now?

483
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,390
thank god he is gone.

484
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,740
Cindy,that man is a person of interest.

485
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,680
I want you to get in your car

486
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,340
and meet me at the station immediately.

487
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,630
hey.

488
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,640
Where you goin'?

489
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,630
I-I thought... I thought you'd left.

490
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,680
No hug good-bye?

491
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,270
Um,I-I have to go.

492
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,230
But I have something for you.

493
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,040
ah bith,ah

494
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,160
You chased a woman into
a dark parking garage.

495
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,560
To give her a rose!

496
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,250
We were gonna start over,so I ran
across the street to the mini-mart.

497
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,310
And do you do those sweet
gestures for your wife,

498
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:37,870
someone you neglected to mention
in your online dating profile?

499
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,770
Hey,everybody cheats.

500
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:45,040
We only care about one of your
extramarital interests... emily sherman?

501
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,850
Never heard of her.

502
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,360
That's odd,because you belonged
to the same health club,

503
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,920
and you'd think you'd remember a woman
whose web page you visited a hundred times

504
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,210
in the last two months.

505
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,800
Okay,fine,I tried to chat her
up,first at the gym,and then online.

506
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,020
But the stuck-up cow wanted
nothing to do with me.

507
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,440
You may want to watch
your language,mr.Palley.

508
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,650
Emily sherman is dead.

509
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,720
What's that got to do with me?

510
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,970
Rejection hurts.

511
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,490
Makes a person
angry,angry enough to kill.

512
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,710
you people are nuts.I want my lawyer.

513
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,860
No problem.

514
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,980
Just tell us where you were two nights
ago between the hours of 7:00 and 10:00.

515
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,100
I was at the movies...

516
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,880
with my wife.

517
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,220
Well,bigstud,that's who
we get to talk to now.

518
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,410
Alexis,come and get it!

519
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:37,540
Hey,get those headphones out
of your ears.I'm starving.

520
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,940
Alexis was snubbed by her father,was
staring down a year in a group home.

521
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,530
I'd run away,too.

522
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,190
Matter of fact,I did.

523
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,640
What?

524
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,690
We have to consider other possibilities.

525
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,770
Emily and milo didn't get along,

526
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,030
and alexis and her mother
fought about him,too.

527
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,310
So you're saying  they killed her?

528
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:14,130
Jacobi checked the skate
park where milo worked today.

529
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,960
He hasn't showed up for his shift.

530
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,980
That just means they ran away together.

531
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,700
With the money they
stole from emily's store.

532
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,080
We spoke to an employee this morning.

533
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,180
The cash register was emptied of $500.

534
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,010
Linz,I know this girl.

535
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,120
She's not a cold-blooded killer.

536
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,110
Which supports what claire found.

537
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,040
Somebody tried to administer C.P.R.

538
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,480
To emily before she died.

539
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,790
they may have lost their
nerve,tried to revive her.

540
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,420
Inspector boxer,come and find
me when you have a minute.

541
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,560
I want to discuss the sherman
investigation with you.

542
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,990
I was just filling in D.D.A.Bernhardt.

543
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,910
Miss bernhardt mov herself from
prosecutor to percipient witness

544
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,700
when she so generously signed on
as alexis sherman's foster parent.

545
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,510
It was a surprise to us all.

546
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,780
Hey,our alert paid off
at transbay terminal.

547
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:59,240
Someone fitting milo's description
inquired about two bus tickets to vegas.

548
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,660
Unis scooped him up.

549
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,790
They're on their way in.

550
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,290
Uh,lindsay?

551
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,790
Sorry.Do I know you?

552
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,050
Kitten guy.

553
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,010
Simon.

554
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,710
Hi.

555
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,110
Extra caramel.

556
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,940
Jill said it's your favorite.

557
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,750
She also said you don't do blind dates.

558
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,270
But now that we've
met,it's no longer an issue.

559
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,100
So,inspector boxer,would you like
to go out to dinner with me tonight?

560
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,370
Wow.

561
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,780
This is so nice.

562
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:38,050
Uh,it's just that we're in the middle of
an investigation,right,inspector jacobi?

563
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:40,040
Oh,yeah.Of course,we always are.

564
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,190
You know,a girl's gotta eat.

565
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,560
hey,you must be simon.

566
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,740
Nice to meet you.Tom.

567
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,510
Tom?

568
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,130
Hogan.

569
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,230
Remember,honey?

570
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,270
Uh,tom,my boss.

571
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,870
We never talk about work.

572
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,980
- tom from the office.
- Yes.

573
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,890
Well,uh,simon was just
leaving,weren't you,babe?

574
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,360
I S.Um,see you tonight?

575
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,370
At 8:00.Bix.

576
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,560
I can't wait.

577
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,530
It's our anniversary.

578
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,610
- See you later.
- Okay.

579
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,490
So he seems nice.

580
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,520
He's wonderful.

581
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,890
Where'd you two meet?

582
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,640
Uh,crime scene.

583
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,890
So which anniversary?

584
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,550
Well,my god,tom,if I didn't know you
better,I'd think you were obsessed.

585
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,930
hey,get off me! Aah!

586
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,450
Oh,um,interrogation.

587
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,790
Do what you want with me,but
you're never gonna find alexis!

588
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,410
What's in vegas,milo?

589
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,990
I don't know.

590
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,300
- Céline dion?
- Where's alexis?

591
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,500
We found her stuff at the motel.

592
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,200
I'm not telling you pigs anything.

593
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,710
You're in ouble,milo,

594
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,430
and I'm not talking about the
b&e,the robbery,the kidnapping.

595
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,170
I'm not even talking about
the murder one charge.

596
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,200
You're in trouble because you and your
girlfriend snowed a friend of mine,

597
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,420
and now I'm pissed.

598
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,650
I didn't murder anybody.

599
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:13,860
And since you're not talking,I've
gotta go with my most probable theory,

600
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:17,900
which is your girlfriend's mom
hated you,and you wanted her gone.

601
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,310
So you waited until emily had plans...

602
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,400
- a night out with a blind date.
- That's not true.

603
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,090
I was hanging with alexis that night.

604
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,380
Shame she's not around
to back you up,huh?

605
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,640
did she put you up to it?

606
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,620
It must have seemed so easy at first,

607
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,710
but then you heard emily's skull crunch,

608
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,540
and you felt her breath as you
shoved the gag in her mouth,

609
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,000
and it got too real,didn't it?

610
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,090
You chickened out.It was too late.

611
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,250
None of that happened.

612
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:47,010
As we speak,forensics experts are
processing the items from your motel room.

613
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,920
If they find one shred
of emily sherman's D.N.A.,

614
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:53,820
I will make it my personal mission to book
you a cell right next to scott peterson.

615
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,990
Listen,I'm innocent.

616
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,590
Innocent men don't flee to vegas.

617
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,500
We weren't fleeing!

618
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,030
We were getting married.

619
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:04,860
Then alexis would be emancipated,and
her life wouldn't be completely wrecked.

620
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,200
You've gotta believe me.

621
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,220
Then tell me where your girlfriend is.

622
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,080
We needed a car.

623
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,110
That's why we took the
money from the bookstore,

624
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,010
but it wasn't nearly enough.

625
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,190
Alexis remembered that her mom just bought
a bunch of personal training sessions worth,

626
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,460
like,2,000 bucks.

627
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,170
She called the gym,but the
trainer dude wasn't working today.

628
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,600
So alexis went over to his
place to get the money back.

629
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,740
Are they analyzing milo's belongings?

630
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:34,040
So far,there's no sign of hair or blood or
anything we can test for emily sherman's D.N.A.,

631
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,300
But here's a contents list.

632
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,300
I haven't had a chance
to look at it yet,but...

633
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,450
careful.I might taint that,too.

634
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,680
Was I naive?

635
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,260
No,honey.

636
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,190
You were just trying to be there for
alexis,because no one was there for you.

637
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,650
Swiss army knife,pair of underwear,

638
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,190
lambskin condoms.What is this,1912?

639
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,070
Let me see that.

640
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,250
I need to check something.

641
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,000
Policy dictates that
i deliver is in person.

642
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,850
An administrative write-up?

643
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,740
It was an ethical breach to assume
custody of a victim's daughter,

644
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,990
especially a victim whose murder
you would've been prosecuting.

645
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,270
Steps had to be taken.

646
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,210
And a verbal warning wouldn't suffice?

647
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,770
This lives in my file forever.

648
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,260
You should be thanking me.

649
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,150
The powers that be,they
were puing for suspension.

650
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,810
Slap a band-aid on that
bleeding heart of yours

651
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,300
or your days in this
office are numbered.

652
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,500
A-alexis left
a half-hour ago.

653
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,150
I told her to meet me
at the gym tomorrow.

654
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,090
You know,it's not like I keep
that kind of cash at home.

655
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,520
Was she acting strange?

656
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,900
No.

657
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,710
What's going on?

658
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,930
excu me.

659
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,670
Uh,excuse me one second,please.

660
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,330
yeah.Boxer.

661
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,490
A latex allergy killed emily sherman.

662
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,710
It's extremely rare.

663
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,470
Less than 1% of the
general population has it.

664
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,340
Because there was no
choking device at the scene,

665
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,620
there was no way that I
could have possibly known.

666
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,310
Well,how do you know now?

667
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:22,270
Milo was carrying lambskin condoms.

668
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,380
I paged alexis' family doctor.

669
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:28,910
He confirmed that she has a
type I hypersensitivity to latex.

670
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,840
Because there is a hereditary component,

671
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,820
I checked emily's body again.

672
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,250
Those marks on her wrists and ankles...

673
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,710
dermatitis at the site of contact.

674
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,380
So he used latex restraints?

675
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,040
Shoved them down her throat,too.

676
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,070
That allergic reaction left untreated
would have brought about anaphylactic shock,

677
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,250
respiratory arrest and death.

678
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,010
Made me think about your bondage guy.

679
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,100
He had a lot of latex,right?

680
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,740
I'll call you back.

681
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,970
Lindsay?

682
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,250
Aah!

683
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,120
Alexis?

684
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,870
Alexis,are you here?

685
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,780
So garret roberts was
obsessed with emily sherman,

686
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,980
and snapped when she
spurned his advances.

687
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,090
in his mind,he sculpted
her into a whole new woman.

688
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,360
How could she share that
with any other man but him?

689
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,290
The night of her date,they
fought in the parking lot.

690
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:11,710
Things escalated,and he hit her
hard enough to knock her out.

691
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,740
Well,that's a long way
from being bound and gagged.

692
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,250
Garret was panicked,delusional.

693
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,110
He wanted a chance to apologize to
emily,to convince her that he meant no harm.

694
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,850
Yeah,unfortunately,he
had a client waiting.

695
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,390
Which left him no choice but to tie emily
up and stuff her in the back of his car.

696
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,470
Never counting on the latex allergy.

697
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,540
How long would she have lasted?

698
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,210
10,15 minutes tops.

699
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,410
She was long gone by the
time he started the C.P.R.

700
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,800
So he found a deserted
alley,dumped her there.

701
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,250
Makes you want to quit the
gym and get fat,doesn't it?

702
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,350
here's your scotch.

703
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,040
Thank you.

704
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,930
How's the throat?

705
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,670
I'll survive.

706
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,550
All right,ladies,

707
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,740
I ge(@to cap off this wonderful evening

708
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:55,630
by canceling on a very
sweet and unsuspecting E.M.T.

709
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,840
Oh,simon?I took care of it.

710
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,860
What did you say?

711
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,710
"Lindsay had a very tough day at work."

712
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,810
I left out the part about
almost getting strangled to death

713
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,470
and blowing a guy's kneecaps off,

714
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,540
in case you wanted to leave
the door open just a lile bit.

715
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,020
Here's his phone
number,and that is the last

716
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,680
you will hear from me on the subject.

717
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,350
Thank you.

718
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,240
Any more questions,lois lane?

719
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,660
Yes.

720
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,120
Cocktails,nicknames.

721
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,990
Does this mean that I am in the club?

722
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,740
Okay,there are some ground rules.

723
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,110
I alrey know a few... ahem...

724
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,740
no ducking the tape at crime scenes,

725
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,290
no first names in public,uh,

726
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,690
assume that everything is off the
record until I'm told otherwise.

727
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,580
What else?

728
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,980
Make me laugh when the chips are down.

729
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,080
When I'm wrong,tell me I'm wrong,even
if you think I don't want to hear it.

730
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:51,750
Keep my secrets.Trust me with yours.

731
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,100
Oh,and buy me shoes on my birthday.

732
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,810
So I'm,uh...

733
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,670
I'm in?

734
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,020
You're in.

735
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,470
I just came to say good
night and that I hate you.

736
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,710
You were right.

737
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,380
Please come in.

738
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,140
Tell me more.

739
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:43,390
I used the kiss me not
case to avoid my life.

740
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,470
My dedication...

741
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,810
obsession...

742
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,700
did cost me,

743
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,380
and I can't help but think that

744
00:35:55,490 --> 00:36:00,090
if I would've put that kind
of effort into other things,

745
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,420
personal things...

746
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,020
live and learn,right?

747
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,830
God,I hope so.

748
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,610
And who knows?Fresh es
could be good for the case.

749
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,520
Happy anniversary,by the way.

750
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,300
You and
bigger-and-better simon?

751
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,110
We're not together.

752
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,750
I met him for the first time
eight seconds before you did.

753
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,510
Yeah,I figured.That slap on
the ass was a little much.

754
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,680
So you're not dating anybody then?

755
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,320
No,

756
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:42,410
and before you ask why,the
official answer is I'm not ready.

757
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,400
Unofficially?

758
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,210
Well,I just think

759
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:53,690
that if I couldn't make it
work with a guy like you,then...

760
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,610
why bother?

761
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,670
And don't let that go to your head.

762
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,670
Lindsay...

763
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:07,520
it takes two people
to fail at a marriage.

764
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,410
Come on.One date.

765
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:17,840
One hour of conversation
with a martini,calamari?

766
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,860
Why do you have to skip
right to divorce number two?

767
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:24,950
could we be done?

768
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:28,010
Sure.

769
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,020
Hey,uh,some of the guys
are stopping by charlie's

770
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,850
later on for a drink.

771
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,320
You should come by,

772
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,990
maybe meet somebody.

773
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,940
Maybe.

774
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,450
Good night,tom.

775
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,730
can I come in?

776
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:07,320
If you're waiting for me to be
offensively optimistic,rest easy.

777
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,900
Are you okay?

778
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,000
I will be,I guess.

779
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,750
I've been trying to think
of what to say to you.

780
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:23,510
You know,something big and eloquent
to explain my stupid behavior?

781
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,400
It's not necessary.

782
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,340
Good.

783
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,220
I couldn't come up with anything.

784
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,570
One of the officers gave me this.

785
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,220
kind of random,huh?

786
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,200
Not if you're a nana
or inspector jacobi.

787
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,090
It made me remember this time

788
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,530
I stole a pack of candy
from my mom's purse.

789
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,550
I was,like,5 or something.

790
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,990
I cried so hard when she caught me.

791
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:49,260
I didn't know how she'd ever forgive me,

792
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,440
but all she said was,

793
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,720
"if you mean it,sorry's enough."

794
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:06,260
I'm sorry.

795
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,440
Sounds like you found your
first 20 on laundry day.

796
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,870
Get comfortable

797
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,010
Good day?

798
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,100
Fine.

799
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,120
- Boys asleep?
- Two hours ago.

800
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,210
- Baby,could you... could you bring me some of...
- thanks.

801
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:35,880
Oh,you... you're blocking the tv.

802
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,850
Ed,I'm here to seduce you.

803
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,990
okay.

804
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:52,280
I had a song and a little dance,and
that ice cream was gonna be part of it...

805
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,020
but it all seemed so
much easier in the car.

806
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,660
Well,don't give up now.

807
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,210
wow.

808
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,060
that works.

809
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,170
- hey!
- This seat taken?

810
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,700
You made it.

811
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,830
Well,barely.Traffic was nuts.

812
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,390
I'm glad you called.

813
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,220
I'm glad you were still free.

814
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,410
I ordered us some appetizers.

815
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,680
Do you know what you wanna
drink or you need more time?

816
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,890
No,I think I'm ready.

817
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,430
all righty.
