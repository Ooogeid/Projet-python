Episode 6

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh, No.

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,200
Oh, No.

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,400
All Right, So I'll See You
Back Here At Noon.
Okay.

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,800
All Right? Come Here.
Mwah.

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,600
Oh, My...

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,200
You're Gonna Be Great.

10
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,600
It'll Be Fine, I Promise.

11
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,900
Boxer.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,900
Yeah,
Uh, I'll Be Right There.

13
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,100
Ow. Son Of A...

14
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,400
I Know, I Know. I'm Sorry.

15
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,400
You Have A Hot Date Last Night
I Didn't Know About?

16
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,700
No. Why?
'Cause I Tried Callin', But Your Phone Was Off.

17
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,200
So What Did They Call Us For?
It's A Suicide, Right?

18
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,600
Ah, It's Joe Donovan.

19
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,500
Joe Donovan?
San Fran's Q.B. For The What,

20
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,900
I Don't Know, Last 15 Years?

21
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,200
Three Super Bowl Rings,
Future Hall  Famer?

22
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,800
Q.B. Stands
For Quarterback, Right?

23
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,300
You Must Be
The Pride Of Texas.

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,300
Come On, Mrs. Donovan.

25
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,700
I Have To Be With Him.
They're Gonna Take Him Away.

26
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,800
It's Okay, Mrs. Donovan.
Let's Just Go Back Upstairs.

27
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,500
Joe's Wife Parris.

28
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,600
She Found The Body This Morning
 I Just Need My Husband.

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,900
When She And The Kids Returned
From Their House In Napa.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,900
At The Moment, She's Floating
Away On A Fistful Of Sedatives.

31
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,000
Wait, Did The Kids See--
No, They Didn't See A Thing.

32
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,300
So Wife, Two Kids--

33
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,200
This Guy Must Have Been In Some Serious Pain To End It This Way.

34
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,400
Joe Donovan Was Not One
To Let Pain Stop Him.

35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,500
The Man Once Played Half A Game
With Two Broken Ribs

36
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,800
And A Dislocated Shoulder.
You Respected Him.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,600
Yeah, And So Should You.
He Did Take The Coward's Way Out.

38
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,600
What? I'm Just Saying--
That You Woke Up On The Wrong Side Of The Bed This Morning.

39
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,700
I Can See That.

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,200
Uh, Is Tom Here?

41
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,000
No. Why?

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,300
No Reason.

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,800
U Guys Are Just In Time.

44
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,200
So He Got Things Rolling
With Booze And Pills,

45
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,700
Then Got The Job Done
With A Knife?

46
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,900
Depressing,
But Definitely Possible.

47
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,400
Or Not.
Looks Like Murder To Me.

48
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,200
Okay, So A Guy Is Found Dead
In A Hot Tub

49
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,200
With Booze, Pills, Slit Wrists,
And It's Not Suicide?

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah.
What Are You Thinking?

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,200
It Just Doesn't Fit.
Not To Generalize,

52
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,300
But Most Men,
When They Choose To End It,

53
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,700
They Pick
A More Traumatic Exit

54
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,300
Like, Uh, Hanging,
Shooting, Train Tracks.

55
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,100
Unlike Most Women,
Who Are Vain Till The End.

56
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,800
They'll Take Slit Wrists
Or A Bottle Of Pills

57
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,900
Over A Gunshot
To The Head Any Day.
Maybe Joe Donovan ??????????????/

58
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,900
No, The Science
Supports Lindsay.

59
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,000
His Cuts Start Superior
And End Inferior To The Wrist,

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And That's The Exact Opposite Of What I'd Exct.
And The Knife Was Wiped Clean.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,200
There Are No Prints On It.
Plus There's No Suicide Note.

62
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,500
Someone Staged This.
I Had Joe's Poster
On My Wall Growing Up.

63
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,500
Number 11, Big Guns.
Ah, This Is So Surreal.

64
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,400
Okay. One, How Old Are You?

65
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,200
And Two, A Football Player?

66
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,400
I Would Have Guessed More,
You Know,

67
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,500
????Nsync, Backstreet Boys.

68
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,600
My Parents Only Had One Kid,

69
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,300
So You're Looking At The Son
My Father Always Wanted.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's Kind Of Sweet.

71
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,500
Is That The Wife?
No, That's The Agent-- Drew Kaplan.

72
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,800
The Wife Was At A Charity Event
In Napa Last Night.

73
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,600
She Left Joe Here At Home For Guys' Poker Night.
Yeah, The Donovans

74
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,900
They Raised Half A Million-Plus
For The Children's Cancer Ward

75
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,100
At Mission Cross North Last Year.

76
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,900
Okay, Let's Get Take It Back To The Station.????

77
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,300
The Vultures Are Circling.

78
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,100
No Offense.

79
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,300
Why Is The D.A.'S Office Here?

80
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,700
Standard Procedure
In Cases This High Profile.

81
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,800
Is There Something Suspicious About Joe's Death?
We Have No Comment

82
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,100
Maurice! Maurice,
You Saw Joe Last Night.

83
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,200
What Was His Mood Like?

84
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,300
How Does It Feel To Be
The Starting Quarterback?

85
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,200
Come On, Give Me A Break.
Joe Was A Friend.

86
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,400
I'm Not Even Thinkin'
About The Game.

87
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,600
So You, Uh,
Left Theame Early.

88
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,400
Yeah. Mo Got Lucky
On The River,

89
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,800
Knocked Me Out Around 11:00.

90
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,700
Hate It When Then Happens.
Yeah.

91
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,600
Uh, Mo--That's
Maurice Jackson, Right?

92
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah.
Mm.

93
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,500
Okay, I Think That's It.

94
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,800
You Know, I-I Used To, Uh,
I Used To Play A Little.

95
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,600
You Know, They Said I Had Great Hands.
So You Were A Wide Receiver?

96
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,700
??????????/

97
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,400
Think You Might've Had
A Little Something For Me?

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,900
You Know,
Well, Maybe In My 20s.

99
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,700
Yeah, Well, Let Me Know
If There's Anything Else

100
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,000
I Can Do For You.
All Right.

101
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,000
Why--Why Can't I
Get A Blind Date

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
With A Guy Like That?
'Cause He's Married.

103
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,100
Hey, Is That Who I Think It Is?
The One And Only. I Just

104
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,200
Finished Taking His Statement.

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,700
I Almost Asked Him
To Sign My Football.

106
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,300
Ah, I Should've Asked Him
To Sign It.

107
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,900
What Is It About This Game?
Move.

108
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,100
Hey, Uh, Would You Mind Signing
This For My Partner, Please?

109
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,200
It's--It's For My Nephew,
Actually. His Name Is Warren.

110
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,500
How's The Case?

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,700
Good. Uh, We Just Talked
To Three Of The Guys

112
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,600
That Were Playing Poker
With Joe Last Night.

113
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,700
After The Game, They All,

114
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,300
Uh, Went Home
To Their... Wives,

115
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,600
Uh, Or Mistresses
Or Their Girlfriends.

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,900
You Know, E-E-Each Guy Said
That Joe Wasn't The Type

117
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,600
To Kill Himself, But, Um,
No One's Venturing A Guess

118
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,200
On Who Would
Want To Murder Him.

119
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,700
We Haven't Spoken To Maurice Jackson Yet.
What About The Knife?

120
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,700
It Matches The Set
At The Donovan House,

121
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,200
But Their Set Is Complete.

122
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,000
The One That Was Used To
Kill Joe Seems To Be An Orphan.

123
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,700
It's Got Some
Special Imprint On It

124
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,300
They're Having Trouble Identifying.
Uh, You Try Pulling The Tapes

125
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,200
From The Houses
In Joe's Neighborhood?

126
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,700
We're On That, And Claire's
Having A Hard Time

127
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,200
Determining The Time Of Death,
Uh, Just 'Cause, You Know,

128
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,400
The Body Was Boiling In A Hot Tub.
Okay.

129
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,200
Okay.

130
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,100
Okay, Wait.

131
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,900
I'm Sorry That I Kicked You Out...
No.

132
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,000
You Know, After We...
I Panicked.

133
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,900
 Me, Too.

134
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,000
Wait. Um...
What?

135
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,900
You, Uh...

136
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,500
Okay, Well,
Uh, Th's It For Now.

137
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,400
Okay.
Mm.

138
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,400
Joe Had Ten Million Reasons
 <I>Not</I> To Commit Suicide.

139
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,700
That Was, Uh,
Joe's Salary This Year.

140
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,700
Oh. Oh. Really?

141
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,600
Well, We Don't Think That Joe
Committed Suicide Either.

142
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,700
How Is It That You Ended Up
At The House, Ms. Kaplan?

143
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,800
The Team Offered Joe A 1-Year
Extension On His Contract.

144
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,300
We Were Gonna Discuss It
Over Breakfast,

145
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,400
So I Went To The House.
The Cops Were Already There,

146
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,000
And Parris Was Hysterical, So I Fed Her Some Pills.
Thanks For That.

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,200
I Have Plenty To Go Around,
And I Certainly Didn't Want Her

148
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,700
Talking To Anyone
In That State.
Let's Talk About That Contract.

149
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,700
Rumor Mill Has It Joe Was
Gonna Retire After The Season.

150
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,300
Negotiation 101?

151
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,300
Hello? That's What I Wanted You
And Everybody Else To Think.

152
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,700
And Joe?
What Did He Think?

153
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,900
Joe Was Gonna Sign.
I Mean, He Had Me Set

154
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,200
A Press Conference
For Thursday.

155
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,700
All Right. So According
To The Housekeeper,

156
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,600
You Have The Donovans'
House Keys, Their Alarm Codes,

157
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,900
So You And Joe
Were Close, Right?

158
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,400
Oh, I Get It.

159
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm Hot, He's Hot,
We Worked Closely Together,

160
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,400
Probably Couldn't Keep
Our Hands Off Of Each Other.

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,500
It Always Leads To Sex,
Right?

162
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,400
You Tell Me.

163
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,400
Look, I Was Joe's Work Wife--
Contract Negotiations,

164
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,300
Image Licensing,
You Name It,

165
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,200
And Occasionally
Some Emotional Hand-Holding,

166
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,600
But Only When It Came
To Football,

167
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,600
And Even Then
I Didn't Enjoy It.

168
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,200
Tenderness, Intimacy--
That Was Parris' Job.

169
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,600
Besides, I Spent The Night
With My Ver... Rachel.

170
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,300
Do You Even Care
That Joe Is Dead?

171
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,300
You Know, Right Now It Is
All About Damage Control.

172
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll Cry Later.
And Idea Who'd Want To Kill Joe?

173
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,700
Well, I Did Leave
My Old Agency

174
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,000
To Start My Own Company.

175
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,600
They Weren't Pleased That
I Took Their Star Client.

176
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,100
So Maybe They Killed Joe
To Punish Me.

177
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,800
Right, Because This Is All About You.
Huh?

178
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Whcan't I See Him?

179
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,000
Who?

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,700
Joe Donovan.
He's Here, Right? His Body's Here,

181
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,200
But The Joe You Remember Has
Passed On To A Better Place.

182
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,300
Well, Can I At Least
See His Body Then?

183
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,700
No.
What About His Super Bowl Ring?

184
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,100
Did He Have That On Him?
Isn't There Some Homework You Can Do

185
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,000
Before Your Dad Gets Here?

186
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,800
Mom, Please, My Hero Is Dead.
I Can't Do Homework.

187
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,900
I Have Something You Guys Are
Gonna Want To See. Hey, Nate.

188
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,800
Nate, You Take One Step
Outside Of This Room,

189
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
And I Don't Need To Tell You
What's Gonna Happen,Ight?

190
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,100
Fine.

191
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,400
Do You Remember How
You Gave Me Ground Rules

192
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,600
Before I Was, Uh, You Know,
In The Club,

193
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,100
And How I Have Followed

194
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,800
Every Single One Of Them?

195
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,000
Now I Have Some Ground Rules.
Is That Really Necessary?

196
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,500
It Is If You Want To See The Disk.
Give Us The Ground Rules.

197
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,200
You Do Not Get To Ask
The Name Of My Source.

198
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,200
What If I Need To Talk To Him?
Another Reporter, Who Will Not Be Named,

199
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,600
Taped A Closed Practice That
Joe's Team Held Last Week.

200
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,900
If The Team Or The League Found Out,
 This Person Could Be Fired.

201
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,200
You Do Not Get The Name
Of My Source.

202
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,900
It Seems Reasonable.
I Don't Like It.

203
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay.

204
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,300
Okay, Fine.

205
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,600
Okay, Thanks.

206
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,700
There's Just One More.
You Don't Get To Keep The Disk.

207
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,700
All Right, No. If There's
Information On That Disk

208
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,000
That Can Help Me
Solve This Murder--

209
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,500
These Are My Ground Rules.

210
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,900
A Man Is Dead.

211
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,900
Fine. It Better Be Good.

212
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,400
 <I>Cover Two...</I>

213
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,100
Wait, I Saw That Other Guy
At Joe's House This Morning.

214
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,000
Maurice Jackson,
Backup Quarterback--

215
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,100
First-String
The Moment Joe Died.

216
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,500
And The Only One Of Joe's
Poker Buddies From Last Night

217
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,900
That Hasn't Come In
To Talk To Us Yet.

218
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,800
 <I>Come On.</I>
 <I>You Want A Piece Of Me?</I>

219
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,400
 <I>I'm-A Kill You! You're Dead!</I>
 <I>I Promise I'm-A Kill You!</I>

220
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,800
 <I>You're Gone!</I>
 <I> Maurice, Chill, Man!</I>

221
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,800
Well, Let's See If Maurice
Keeps His Promises.

222
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,900
Heard Maurice Jackson
Finally Came In.

223
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,200
Is Lindsay Sharpening
Her Claws?

224
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,300
Ah, She Was,
Until He Lawyered Up.

225
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,600
Of Course. I Wonder What
$1,000-An-Hour Pretty Boy

226
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,700
Maurice Has On Retainer.
Hey, We Must Be Going To The Same Place.

227
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,300
Hanson.
Public Defender?

228
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,700
Doesn't Maurice Have
Ten Million Reasons To Hire

229
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,800
A High-Priced Pit Bull?
$3 Million. He May Have Been A First-Round Pick,

230
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,100
But He's Still Second-Stri.
I Handled A Case For Maurice

231
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,600
When I Was Still
In Private Practice.

232
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,200
We Kept In Touch.

233
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,100
I S In The Neighborhood,
Told Him I'd Stop By.

234
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,400
Uh, Assault, Wasn't It?

235
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,700
Hey, Someone's Been
Doing His Research.

236
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,800
Yeah, But You Know That

237
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,200
That Case Got Thrown Out Of Court, Right?
On A Technicality.

238
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,300
Well, God Is In The Details.

239
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,800
So I've Advised
Mauricnot To Talk.

240
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,100
So Book Him Or Let Him Walk.

241
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,000
Okay.

242
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,100
Miss Bernhardt,
Always A Pleasure.

243
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,100
Give Me Two Minutes.

244
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,500
Hmm?

245
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,400
Mm.

246
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,900
We Both Know A Public Defender
Can't Have A Private Client.

247
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,600
Doesn't Mean I Can't Give Him
Free Advice If I So Choose,

248
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,400
Which I Do.
Maurice Was The Last Person At The Poker Game,

249
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,800
Which Means He Was The Last
Person To See Joe Alive.

250
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,900
Listen, I Saw Him
At Joe's House.

251
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,700
He Cared About Him,

252
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,000
And If He Cared About Him,
He Should Want To Do

253
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Everything Possible To Help
Catch The Man Who Lled Him.

254
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,300
I'll Tell You What, Um, If You
Go Out To Dinner With Me,

255
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,600
I'll Let Your Inspector Friends
Talk To Maurice.

256
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,900
That's Completely Unethical...
And Ridiculous!

257
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
So Sue Me.

258
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,300
Joe And I Talked Playbook.

259
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,000
It Got Late. He Said
His Back Was Killing Him,

260
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,600
And He Was Gon'
Hit The Hot Tub.

261
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,500
He Was Alive And Well
The Last I Saw Him.

262
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,700
I Don't Know What Else To Tell You.
You And Joe Ever Fight?

263
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,100
'Cause I Heard You Got Into It Last Week.
You Got A Temper,???????????//

264
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,600
I Like To Think Of It
As Passion.

265
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,500
That Was A Misunderstanding, And He Came After <I>Me.</I>
A Misunderstanding

266
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,300
That Ended With You
Threatening To Kill Him.

267
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,600
I've Been Taking A Crash Course
On Football Since Joe Died.

268
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,000
There's A Big Difference Between
First-String And Second-String.

269
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,600
You Had A Lot To Gain With Joe's Death.
What Happened To Our ???????????

270
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,800
Why Would I Kill Joe? He Was Retiring.
No, He Wasn't.

271
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,100
You Have No Idea What You're Talkin' About, Lady.
But I Do.?????????????

272
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,100
Waiting On The Table For His Signature.
He Was About To Announce It

273
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,900
?????????????

274
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,400
Now At Had To Have Infuriated You.
We're Done Here. Come On.

275
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,000
Look, I Wanted To Be
The Starter More Than Anything,

276
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,500
But If Joe Wanted
Back With The Team,

277
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
And The Team Wanted Joe,
I'm Cool With That.

278
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,200
You Act Like
I Don't Got Options.

279
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,400
I Coulda Aed For A Trade,
And Ten Other Teams

280
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,800
Would've Signed Me
In A Heartbeat.

281
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,000
Nate?

282
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,300
Are You Supposed
To Be In There?

283
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,400
You're Not Supposed
To Be In Here. Come On.

284
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,000
That's Not Joe.
It's Just His Body.

285
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,400
Hey, Do You Remember
That Game A Couple Years Ago--

286
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,300
San Fran, Chicago?

287
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,000
Q.B.S Couldn't See
20 Yards In The Snow?

288
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,400
I Watched That Game
With My Dad.

289
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,700
Me, Too.

290
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,800
Oh, The First Half Was
A Total Defensive Battle.

291
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,000
But When Joe Came Out Of
The Locker Room After Halftime,

292
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,200
Mm, Man, You Could
Just Tell He Was Over It...

293
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,500
He Laid That Perfect Spiral

294
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,900
Into Williams' Waiting Arms
To Start The Third Quarter.

295
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,300
He Never Looked Back.

296
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,400
You Should Remember Him
That Way.

297
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,000
You Stay Put Like
You're Supposed To.

298
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,600
Maybe I'll Show You
My 2005 Super Bowl Program...

299
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,900
Signed By The Team.

300
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,600
Don't Tell My Mom I Was In There.
Pinkie Swear.

301
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,100
I Mean, It's Extortion...
Or Blackmail Or Something.

302
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,000
Just Go To Dinner With Him.

303
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's Not Like U Still Have
Any Feelings For The Guy.

304
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,700
That's True.
There's History,

305
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,000
But We're Figuring Out
How To Make Things Work,

306
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,900
Kind Of Like
Lindsay And Tom.

307
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,500
Okay,
Not Like Lindsay And Tom.

308
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,400
It's Just I'm Trying

309
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,700
To Be Super Extra-Good
Girlfriend Right Now.

310
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,500
Luke Is Being Deposed Today.
For What?

311
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,300
A Couple Months Ago,

312
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,000
A 4-Year-Old Girl
Came In To The E.R.

313
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,500
Her Parents Thought
She'd Eaten Some Crayons.

314
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,300
Her Uth Was All Green.
She Seemed Fine.

315
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,200
She Was Running Around.

316
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Her Blood Work Was Good,
So Luke Sent Her Home.

317
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,900
In The Middle Of The Night,
She Died--Iron Poisoning.

318
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,100
Turned Out She'd Eaten A Bottle Of Multivitamins.
That's Awful.

319
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,400
Yeah.

320
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,300
But I'm Sure Luke
Did Everything He Could.

321
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,300
The Parents Are Probably Just
Trying To Make Sense Of It

322
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,600
And Looking
For Someone To Blame.

323
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,300
Absolutely, I Get It,
Believe Me.

324
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,200
It's Just I Wish...

325
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,400
I Don't Know, Some Other Doctor
Had Been On That Night.

326
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,100
What'd I Miss?
Claire's About To Give Us The Rundown.

327
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,700
Joe Donovan--
The Man Was Not Fine.

328
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,500
Degenerative Arthritis,
Multiple Concussions,

329
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,800
Numerous Broken Bones.

330
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,600
I Don't Know How This Guy
Got Out Of Bed In The Morning,

331
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,000
Let Alone Played
A Game Of Football.

332
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,000
The Tox Results Came Back.
Joe Had Enough Benzodiazepine

333
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,900
In His System To Knock Him Out Cold.
So That's How ?????????

334
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,200
To Cut His Wrists Without A Struggle.
There's One Drug In Joe's System

335
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,700
That I Haven't
Been Able To Identify.

336
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,200
I'm Having The Lab
Run More Tests.

337
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,500
Other Than That, It's What
We Expected--Alcohol,

338
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,300
A Small Amount Of Steroids And A Pharmacy Of Painkillers.
 Well, The Painkillers ???

339
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,000
The Guy Was A Boy Scout
Except For A D.U.I.

340
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,300
He Got Three Years Ago.
No Drinking Was Involved,

341
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,200
But He Did Cop To Taking
Too Many Pills For An Injury.

342
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,400
He Did Twice The Amount
Of Community Service Hours

343
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,200
He Was Sentenced To
And Put It Behind Him.

344
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,800
Wait, Ouldn't Lindsay
Be Hearing All Of This?
She Already Has.

345
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,000
I Caught Her Right Before Joe's Wife Showed Up.
Guess Those Sedatives ?????

346
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,900
We Spoke To Your Nanny--
Julie, Was It?

347
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,900
She's One Of Our Nannies,

348
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,300
Although I-I-I Think That
Julie's The Boys' Favorite.

349
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,500
She Told Us That She Watched
The Kids Last Night In Napa

350
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,800
While You Went Alone
To The Charity Dinner

351
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,700
At Gallerka Vineyards.

352
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,300
That's Right. Um...

353
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,600
I Snuck In To Kiss The Boys
Good Night When I Got Home

354
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,900
Around... Midnight,

355
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And Then I Took A Sleeping Pill
To Help Me Nod Off.

356
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,400
You, Uh, Pop A Lot Of Pills,
Mrs. Donovan.

357
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,200
How Was Your Marriage?
I Don't See How That's Relevant.

358
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,800
I Know This Is Hard,

359
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,700
But Anything That
You Can Tell Us Will Help.

360
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,700
It Was Hard Having Joe Gone
All The Time.

361
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,000
And Even When He Was At Home,

362
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,600
I--His Mind Was On The Game.
But That's Part Of The Deal

363
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,000
When You Marry
A Professional Athlete.

364
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,700
I Knew What I Signed Up For It.
What About Affairs?

365
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,900
Joe??????????????

366
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,700
Joe Was A Star

367
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,200
He Could Have Any Woman
That He Wanted,

368
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,400
But He Wasn't The Type.

369
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,400
He Lived His Life Like He Played
The Game, 100% Committed.

370
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,500
Drew Kaplan Said
That She W Joe's Work Wife.

371
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,500
More Like A Slave Driver.

372
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,400
Did You Know That She
Convincehim To Sign On

373
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
To Do Another Year,
When All He Wanted To Do...

374
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,300
Was Retire And Spend Time
With Me And The Boys?

375
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,300
Work Wife?
I Don't Think So.

376
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,300
I'm Sorry This Is
So Upsetting, Parris.

377
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,900
I Think That's Enough For Now.
Thank You For Coming In.

378
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,800
We Need To Subpoena
The Gps Records

379
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,600
From The Wife's Car.

380
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,100
I Want Confirmation That Parris
Was In Napa Last Night.

381
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,900
Mrs. Donovan Is A Suspect?
Well, Statistics Are Statistics For A Reason.

382
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,400
It's Usually The Spouse...

383
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,000
Even If She Does Come
In A Perfect Package.

384
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,000
Uh, I Need To Talk To You
For A Second.

385
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,200
We're Gonna Have This Conversation Now?
Yeah, Just Take A Sec.

386
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,300
Okay. It--We Were Vulnerable.
It Was A Moment, All Right?

387
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,900
No, No, Not--Not--
Hold On, No Running!

388
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,600
Everyone Stay
With Your Buddies.

389
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,100
Hey! We're Here.

390
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,800
Hi.

391
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,800
Ew! Ms. Donnelly Kissed A Boy.
That's Gross.

392
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,300
It's My Fianc?
That Makes It Okay.

393
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,500
Hi, Lindsay.

394
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,500
Hello.

395
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,300
Uh, Like I Was Saying,

396
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,100
Heather Is Visiting
With Her Class Today.

397
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,700
Whoa.
Look Over There.

398
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,700
That's Great.

399
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,200
Do You Guys
Have Any Questions?

400
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,600
I'm So Sorry.
 I He ????????/

401
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,700
Are We Early?

402
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,300
No. No, Right On Time.
Is She A Cop?

403
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,200
She's Too Pretty
To Be A Cop.

404
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,500
A Lady Can Be A Cop?

405
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,700
I'm An Inspector, Actually.
Um, Homicide.

406
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,800
What's Homicide?

407
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,100
Okay, You Guys, I Think--
I Thk We Should Let

408
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,200
Inspector Boxer Get Back To Work.
Have You Ever Shot Anyone?

409
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,500
Well, Uh,

410
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,800
Yes, But, Um, Only When I
Didn't Have Any Other Choice.

411
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,800
Are You Married?
I Used To Be.

412
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,200
I Mean, He--
It Doesn't Matter.

413
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,900
Hey, Who Wants To See A Gun?

414
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,800
Me! Me!
Uh, I Need To Borrow

415
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,000
Inspector Boxer
For Just A Minute.
Aw.

416
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,400
Hey, Hey. You Know What's
More Fun Than Talking To Her?

417
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Candy! It's Right Over There
By The Jail Cell.

418
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,700
Come On. Come On.
Go, Go, Go, Go, Go!

419
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,000
Have You Lost Your Mind?

420
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,000
Is This Just Gonna Be
A Thing Of Hers?

421
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,700
She's Just Gonna Pop Up Whenever She Wants To?
We Got Your <I>Us'.</I>

422
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,400
Thank You.
Tom Is Marrying Her.

423
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,600
She's Gonna Be Around
For... Ever.

424
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,600
I Just... Have You Seen
The Way She Looks At Him?

425
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,900
It's Just So Googly-Eyed.

426
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,700
You Mean Kind Of How,
Like, You Look At Him?

427
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,200
Okay, I Am Not, Nor Have
I Ever Been, Googly-Eyed...

428
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Over Anyone.

429
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,300
Distract Me. Tell Me
About The Gps Records.

430
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,900
Parris' Car Sat In The Driveway
Of Their Napa Home

431
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,200
From 11:45 P.M. Till
8:00 A.M. The Next Morning

432
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,300
When She And The Kids Drove
Back To San Francisco.

433
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,000
Damn It.
Good News Is I've Nailed Down Time Of Death.

434
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,000
Joe Bled Out And Died
Around 3:00 A.M.

435
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,300
It'd Be So Nice
If We Had A Suspect.

436
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,700
What About Maurice? I Thought
You Hadn't Ruled Him Out.

437
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,900
No, I Haven't. I Actually Got
Somebody Following Up On That.

438
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,100
Maurice Jackson? Cindy Thomas,
"San Francisco Register."

436
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
How'd You Get In Here?

437
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,289
I Sort Of Snuck In.

438
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:11,800
I'm Doing A Piece
On The Stadium's Ground Crew

439
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:13,500
For The Metro Section.

440
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:16,885
Hey, Just Five
Pain-Free Minutes,

441
00:21:16,886 --> 00:21:18,490
And Then You Can Go
About Your Day.

442
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:21,480
I Can Be Happy Knowing That
I Got To Talk To The Guy

443
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:24,930
Who Led Texas Back From
An 18-Point Halftime Deficit

444
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:26,400
<I>In The Bowl Game Of--</I>

445
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:28,350
What Are You,
Like Rain Man Or Something?

446
00:21:28,351 --> 00:21:30,713
It Was Just Pretty Hard
To Forget.

447
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,240
Uh, So About The Ground Crew,
Just One Quote?

448
00:21:34,241 --> 00:21:37,000
You Expect Me To Believe That
On The Day Joe Donovan Dies,

449
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:38,425
The "Register"
Wants To Do A Piece

450
00:21:38,426 --> 00:21:40,190
On The Stadium's Ground Crew?

451
00:21:40,191 --> 00:21:43,251
You Want To Ask Me About Joe?
Just Be Straight.

452
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:46,950
How's This For Straight?

453
00:21:46,951 --> 00:21:49,520
My Dad Died 18 Months Ago.

454
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:51,480
He Loved Joe Donovan.

455
00:21:51,481 --> 00:21:53,400
I Loved My Dad.

456
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:55,300
We Used To Watch
Every Game Together.

457
00:21:55,301 --> 00:21:57,476
Now I Watch For Us Both.

458
00:21:57,511 --> 00:21:59,040
Every Game?

459
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,930
I Could Tell You Every Stat,

460
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:04,654
Every Injury You
Or Joe Ever Had.

461
00:22:04,655 --> 00:22:06,860
<I>(Chuckles) Joe's Would Be
A Long List.</I>

462
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:08,700
Off The Record,

463
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:12,327
I Swear... I Don't Know,
It's Just--

464
00:22:12,321 --> 00:22:13,800
It's Weird To Think About Joe

465
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:15,265
As Regular Flesh And Blood.

466
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:16,585
Yeah, Joe Was Human,
All Right.

467
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:20,360
He Was 35. He Had Numbness,
Pins And Needles...

468
00:22:20,361 --> 00:22:22,300
And Dr. Boyd Let Him Play?

469
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:25,500
Seriously, Off The Record,
One Fan To Another.

470
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,800
Look...

471
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:32,300
They Had Blowups
About This All The Time.

472
00:22:32,301 --> 00:22:34,400
Would Be Fighting About It
Today If Joe Was Here.

473
00:22:34,401 --> 00:22:36,300
I Don't Want To See
That In Print.

474
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:39,312
Not A Chance.

475
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,100
Hey, Take Care Of Yourself
Out There.

476
00:22:43,101 --> 00:22:45,800
I'll Be Fine, Rain Man.

477
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,290
You Came To Check On Me.

478
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,175
I Couldn't Stand Not Knowing
How You Were. How'd It Go?

479
00:23:01,176 --> 00:23:03,700
Um, The Plaintiff's Lawyers

480
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:06,350
Are--Are Threatening
Criminal Charges.

481
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:06,850
Crimal?

482
00:23:08,126 --> 00:23:10,940
Where's The Intent To Harm
Or--Or Blatant Indifference?

483
00:23:10,941 --> 00:23:12,530
The Parents Said That,
Uh, That I Didn't Listen.

484
00:23:12,531 --> 00:23:14,274
They Said That, Uh,
That They Told Me

485
00:23:14,275 --> 00:23:16,795
That It Could've Been
Vitamins.
I Thought They Said Crayons.

486
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:18,300
I Was Just Coming Off
A 24-Hour Shift.

487
00:23:18,301 --> 00:23:19,810
They Were Yelling In Spanish.
I Thought I Understood 'Em.

488
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:22,920
I Don't Know. Maybe I Should've
Gotten A Translator Or--
No, No, Hey.

489
00:23:22,921 --> 00:23:24,780
It Sounds Like
A Negotiation Ploy.

490
00:23:24,781 --> 00:23:27,500
Okay, Just Don't
Let Them Settle,

491
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:30,000
Especially If It Means
Admitting Guilt.
Yeah, Well,
It's The Hospital's Lawyer,

492
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:31,500
So I Don't Have
Much Of A Say In This.

493
00:23:31,501 --> 00:23:34,010
If They Bring Me Up On Criminal
Charges, My Career Is Over.

494
00:23:34,011 --> 00:23:37,000
Even If I'm Acquitted,
I'm Done.
Let's Not Go There Just Yet.

495
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,340
Don't You Think
We Should've Called First?

496
00:23:43,341 --> 00:23:45,490
It's Called
The Element Of Surprise.

497
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:46,815
Plus, My Source Said

498
00:23:46,816 --> 00:23:49,915
That Dr. Boyd
Likes To Keep Late Hours.
So You're Thinking

499
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,950
The Team Doctor
Offed The Star Q.B.

500
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:53,200
Because He Was Gonna
Rat Him Out

501
00:23:53,201 --> 00:23:55,415
For Overmedicating
His Players?
Yeah, It's Possible.

502
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:56,925
And I've Been Doing
Research On The Game.

503
00:23:56,926 --> 00:23:58,759
Team Doctor's Don't Have
The Best Reputations

504
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,800
For Putting
Their Players' Health First.

505
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,300
Dr. Boyd?

506
00:24:03,301 --> 00:24:04,555
It's Insctors Boxer
And Jacobi

507
00:24:04,556 --> 00:24:05,950
From The San Francisco
Police Department.

508
00:24:05,951 --> 00:24:08,400
Could We Have A Moment
Of Your Time, Please?
(Clattering)

509
00:24:09,254 --> 00:24:11,454
Dr. Boyd,
Are You In There?

510
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,000
Stop!

511
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,900
(Jacobi) I Said Halt!

512
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Stop!

513
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,500
Oh, Come On.

514
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,450
(Grunts)
Drew Kaplan.

515
00:24:37,451 --> 00:24:40,000
<I>Oh, This Time,
It Is All About You.</I>

516
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,500
My Partner Is Irritated
You Made Us Run.

517
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,700
I Don't Like Running.

518
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,500
I Was Scared.
It Was Dark.

519
00:24:55,501 --> 00:24:56,820
You Know, The League's
Not Goa Look Too Kindly

520
00:24:56,821 --> 00:25:01,150
On An Agent Trying To Steal
Team Health Records.
Well, I Didn't Steal
Team Records.

521
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:04,030
Right, Just Joe's.
I Was Just Trying
To Protect My Client.

522
00:25:04,031 --> 00:25:05,884
Your Client Or Yourself,
Ms. Kaplan?

523
00:25:05,885 --> 00:25:09,000
<I>This So Doesn't Look Good
For You.
I Didn't Kill Joe.</I>

524
00:25:09,001 --> 00:25:12,120
I Am Just Trying To Contain
The Ridiculous Rumors.

525
00:25:12,121 --> 00:25:14,555
"The Bench Report" Wrote
That They Found Steroids

526
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:16,200
In Joe's System.
"The Bench Report"?

527
00:25:16,201 --> 00:25:19,000
It's A Sports Blog.
Yeah, If Mainstream Press
Got Ahold Of That...

528
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:21,295
I Had To Make Sure There Was
Nothing In These Files

529
00:25:21,296 --> 00:25:23,135
That Could Hurt
Joe's Reputation.

530
00:25:23,136 --> 00:25:25,890
As His Agent,
I Have A Responsibility

531
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,830
To Ensure
That His Memorabilia

532
00:25:27,831 --> 00:25:29,350
And Licensing
Earning Potential

533
00:25:29,351 --> 00:25:31,340
Doesn't Fade.

534
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:32,670
Yes, You Wouldn't Want
Something Like Death

535
00:25:32,671 --> 00:25:34,120
To Get In The Way
Of A Little Money.

536
00:25:34,121 --> 00:25:35,920
Especially When 10%
Of $10 Million

537
00:25:35,921 --> 00:25:37,700
Has Already Been
Thrown Out The Door.

538
00:25:38,701 --> 00:25:40,450
I Owed It To Joe's Children.

539
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:42,290
Well, It's Nice To Know
That There Are Still

540
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,370
Some Selfless People
In This World, Ms. Kaplan.

541
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:46,640
Thank You,
Inspector Boxer.

542
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:48,500
You Think She's Guilty?

543
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:52,920
<I>Yeah, Of Being
A Greedy, Conniving Agent.</I>

544
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,620
She Also Stood
To Profit More

545
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:56,035
From Joe Being Alive
Than Dead,

546
00:25:56,036 --> 00:25:58,199
So I Don't Tnk
She Killed Him.

547
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,100
Well, I'm Gonna Send A Uni
Back Out To Pacific Estates.

548
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,180
A Couple Of Those Houses

549
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:05,200
Haven't Released
Their Security Tapes.

550
00:26:05,201 --> 00:26:08,899
Okay. Meanwhile,
Let's Talk To Dr. Boyd.

551
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,000
Hey, Lindsay.

552
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:12,400
Hey, I Was Hoping
I'd Run Into You.

553
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:14,780
(Jacobi) I'll, Uh,
Start Without You.

554
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:18,260
Can We Talk?

555
00:26:18,261 --> 00:26:19,666
Here? Now?

556
00:26:19,668 --> 00:26:21,400
I Was Thinking
The, Uh, Break Room.

557
00:26:21,401 --> 00:26:25,170
Uh, We Are In The Middle Of
A Very Important Case, So...

558
00:26:25,171 --> 00:26:27,720
Please, Lindsay.
Just One Minute.

559
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:29,534
Okay.

560
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:37,100
(Sighs) Okay,
This Is Really Awkward For Me.

561
00:26:37,101 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm Not Really Sure
Where To Start.

562
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:41,900
Uh, If You Need
More Time,

563
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:42,910
We Can Do This Later.

564
00:26:42,911 --> 00:26:47,999
No. I Can Do This.

565
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,550
I'm Sorry.
Excuse Me?

566
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,190
I'm Sorry.

567
00:26:52,191 --> 00:26:54,200
For What?

568
00:26:54,201 --> 00:26:56,423
Sit.

569
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,457
Cookie? (Sighs)

570
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:04,165
When We First Met--
That Day In Tom's Office--

571
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:06,145
I Tried To Play It So Cool,
Like I Could Care Less

572
00:27:06,146 --> 00:27:07,695
That Tom Was Working
With His Ex-Wife Again,

573
00:27:07,696 --> 00:27:09,950
But Truthfully,
The Whole Thing Terrified Me.

574
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,454
I Mean, What If He Realized He
Still Loved You Or Something?
No, He Doesn't.

575
00:27:13,455 --> 00:27:14,949
No, I Know. It's Stupid.

576
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,625
And Then When You
Walked In On Us--

577
00:27:17,626 --> 00:27:20,305
The Thing
With The Italian Shirt?
Mm, I Barely Remember That.

578
00:27:20,301 --> 00:27:22,700
I Was Happy,
Like I Felt Like I Was

579
00:27:22,701 --> 00:27:25,999
Staking My Claim Or Something.
It's So Juvenile.
It's Understandable.

580
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,220
And Then Yesterday You Were
So Cute With The Kids.

581
00:27:28,221 --> 00:27:29,500
Can You Forgive Me?

582
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,585
Yes. Yes, I Can.

583
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,271
Thanks.

584
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,604
Oh.

585
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,408
Yeah.

586
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,165
Oh, Tom Always Said
I'd Like You

587
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,166
If I Just Gave It A Chance.

588
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,905
Well, You Seem Nervous,
Dr. Boyd.

589
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:57,130
Anything You Want To Ask Me

590
00:27:57,131 --> 00:27:59,410
Is Covered Under
Doctor-Patient Confidentiality.

591
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,740
So You Don't Care That People
Are Starting To Say

592
00:28:01,741 --> 00:28:03,680
That You Were
Feeding Joe Steroids?

593
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:07,159
For Medicinal Purposes Only,
To Bringown Swelling.

594
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,270
What About Painkillers?

595
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:10,270
Seems To Me That Was
To Keep Him Going,

596
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,569
Even When His Body Said No.

597
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,159
Isn't There A Policy Against
Overmedicating Athletes?

598
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,731
I Never Once
Overmedicated Joe.

599
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:18,020
Well, Joe Admitted As Much
When He Got The D.U.I.

600
00:28:18,021 --> 00:28:20,960
Three Years Ago.
It's Always The Doctors Who
Take The Fall, Isn't It?

601
00:28:20,961 --> 00:28:23,000
When The Evidence Points
In That Direction, Yes.

602
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,800
You Know What?
Joe Is Dead.

603
00:28:26,801 --> 00:28:29,999
I Don't Need
To Protect Him Anymore.

604
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,400
Joe Didn't Pop Too Many Pills
The Day He Got That D.U.I.

605
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,475
He Had A Seizure
Due To A T.B.I.

606
00:28:36,476 --> 00:28:38,210
He Suffered In A Game
Two Weeks Prior.

607
00:28:38,211 --> 00:28:39,895
Drove Off The Road,
Crashed Into A Tree.

608
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,550
He's Lucky No One Got Hurt.
T.B.I.--
Traumatic Brain Injury.

609
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,860
Joe Asked Me To Hide The Seizure
So He Could Continue To Play.

610
00:28:45,861 --> 00:28:47,020
I Tried
To Talk Him Out Of It,

611
00:28:47,021 --> 00:28:49,500
But He Wouldn't Listen.

612
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,265
Football--
That Was Everything To Him.

613
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,500
(Cindy) How Big
Of A Piece Do You Need?

614
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:56,050
Not Much.

615
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,720
Oh! Brains Belong
Inside The Head.

616
00:29:01,721 --> 00:29:04,660
Sorry.
So Jacobi Talked
To Dr. Boyd.

617
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,995
Joe Was Neither Drunk
Nor On Drugs

618
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,250
When He Got His D.U.I.
Three Years Ago.
So What,
He Was High On Life?

619
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:11,570
He Had A Seizure.

620
00:29:11,571 --> 00:29:13,185
It Was A Lingering Side Effect
Of T.B.I.--

621
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:15,070
Traumatic Brain Injury.

622
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,620
I'm Learning Football Terms.

623
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:18,260
Doesn't T.B.I. Go Along
With What Maurice

624
00:29:18,261 --> 00:29:20,250
Told Cindy About Joe--
Numbness And Tingling?

625
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:22,760
I Went Back To Watch The Fight
Between Joe And Maurice

626
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,240
To See If There Was
Anything We Missed,

627
00:29:24,241 --> 00:29:26,360
And There's--There's Nothing
That Points To Maurice,

628
00:29:26,361 --> 00:29:28,390
But I Was Able To Play Around
With The Video

629
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,765
And Zoom In A Little Bit,

630
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,159
And I Swear, Right Before
The Fit Starts,

631
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,510
Joe's Hands Start Shaking
Like He Lost Control.

632
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,760
(Claire) Okay, You Know How
We Couldn't Identify

633
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,700
One Of The Drugs
In Joe's System?

634
00:29:39,701 --> 00:29:42,870
Well, The Results Came Back.
It Was Rasagiline.

635
00:29:42,871 --> 00:29:44,598
(Lindsay)
I've Never Heard Of It.

636
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,300
It's Not Exactly
In My Wheelhouse Either.

637
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:50,250
Rasagiline...
Is A Therapeutic Drug

638
00:29:50,251 --> 00:29:52,870
Approved Last Year
By The F.D.A.

639
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,555
Well, What Does It Treat?

640
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,380
That's What
I Wanted To Confirm.

641
00:29:56,381 --> 00:29:59,960
Joe Donovan's Substantia Nigra
Cells Were Dying Off,

642
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,370
And The Ones That Were Left
Are Abnormal.

643
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,100
English, Please.

644
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,708
Joe Donovan
Had Parkinson's Disease.

645
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,770
Parkinson's Is
A Degenerative Disease.

646
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:19,070
Joe Could've Lived For Years.

647
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,020
I Mean, As An Athlete,

648
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:22,799
The Thought Of Losing Control
Of His Body...

649
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,999
I Don't Know, Maybe Joe
Did Want To Check Out.
Joe Wasn't A Quitter.

650
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,110
(Laughs) If I Didn't Know
Any Better,

651
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,000
I'd Say You Respected The Guy.

652
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,000
Well, I May Even Watch
A Game One Of These Days.

653
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,870
You Remember
The Donovans' Nanny?

654
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,319
You Mean Three Nannies?

655
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,379
No, Julie Gits--The One
Who Was Corralling Parris

656
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,650
The Morning Joe Died.
Yeah.

657
00:30:42,266 --> 00:30:44,139
Well, She Was
Supposed To Be In Napa,

658
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:49,400
But Her Car Drove Back Into
Pacific Estates At 1:30 A.M.,

659
00:30:49,401 --> 00:30:52,999
Anshe Exited Little More
Than Two Hours Later.

660
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,897
Okay,
You Wrangle The Nanny.

661
00:30:55,932 --> 00:30:57,860
I Will Sweet-Talk
The Tech Guys

662
00:30:57,895 --> 00:30:59,868
Into Jumping Our Little
Video Enhancement Program

663
00:30:59,903 --> 00:31:02,593
To The Front Of The Line.
There You Go.

664
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,320
(Lindsay) Hey, We Got
The Nanny On Videotape.

665
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,400
Heather Said
That She Ran Into You.

666
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,100
Yeah. She Was
Dropping Off Cookies.
Did--Did She Seem Weird?

667
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:12,125
Did She... (Clears Throat)

668
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,331
Actually, She Apologized...
To Me. How's That For Irony?

669
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:17,123
Whew.

670
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,650
Look, Linz, Heather Can
Never Know About This.

671
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:26,742
Well, That--
That's Your Call.

672
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,910
It Was A Mistake--

673
00:31:27,911 --> 00:31:30,970
Onetime Thing,
Never Happen Again.

674
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,876
Hey, You Showed Up
On My Doorstep.

675
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:43,774
Hi. The Techs Are Still
Working On The Video.

676
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,266
Keep Your Fingers Crossed.

677
00:31:45,301 --> 00:31:46,171
What, Is She In There?

678
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,529
Yeah, But Listen, If I--

679
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,596
I Think I Can Handle
The Nanny.

680
00:31:58,566 --> 00:32:00,002
What The...

681
00:32:00,033 --> 00:32:02,192
I Tried To Warn You.

682
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:04,457
The Girl Is A Faucet.
Did She Say Anything?

683
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,265
Oh, Lots.

684
00:32:05,266 --> 00:32:08,326
Let's See, She, Uh, Stole
A Candy Bar When She Was 12.

685
00:32:08,366 --> 00:32:11,173
She Once Played Sick To Go
To A White Stripes Concert.

686
00:32:11,332 --> 00:32:13,019
She Borrowed One Of
Mrs. Donovan's Dresses

687
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:16,231
Without Her Permission--
Did She Say Anything
About Joe Donovan's Murder?

688
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:18,500
Well, Not Yet. We Only
Made It Through Spring '06.

689
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:23,000
Do We Have Any Soothing
Chamomile Tea Lying Around?

690
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:24,295
(Crying) It's Okay.

691
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:26,399
We Can Keep Going.
I Promise.

692
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,633
This Many Tears...

693
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,164
You Know,
Someone Might Look At That

694
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:32,442
As A Sign Of Remorse.

695
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,277
You Want To Tell Us
What You're Sorry About?

696
00:32:36,312 --> 00:32:38,254
I--It's The Kids.

697
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:42,570
I Think About Them
Not Having Their Dad.

698
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,832
(Jacobi)
And You Feel Responsible?

699
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:46,318
He Was A Great Guy.

700
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:48,900
Okay.

701
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:51,837
Uh, Why Don't You Tell Us
A Little More About Joe?

702
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,000
A Lot Of Players, You Know,

703
00:32:55,001 --> 00:32:57,146
They Don't Want
To Be Role Models.

704
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,860
But Joe To It
Really Seriously.

705
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:03,400
He Said He Had A Reason
To Stand Up And Be Counted.

706
00:33:03,401 --> 00:33:05,839
"Stand Up And Be Counted,"
Those Were His Exact Words?

707
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,370
Why?

708
00:33:11,695 --> 00:33:13,089
(Lindsay) Hey.

709
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:17,349
Um, Mrs. Donovan,
I Am Afraid That I Have

710
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,897
Some Really Upsetting News.

711
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,699
Your Nanny--Julie--

712
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,924
Drove Into Pacific Estates
At 1:30 A.M.

713
00:33:24,925 --> 00:33:26,500
The Night
That Joe Was Killed.

714
00:33:26,501 --> 00:33:27,546
Julie?

715
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,860
She Was In Napa.
What--What Are You Saying?

716
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,116
Your Husband And Julie
Had More Than

717
00:33:35,151 --> 00:33:38,502
An Employer-Employee
Relationship.

718
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:41,142
That's Not Possible.

719
00:33:41,177 --> 00:33:42,300
We Think That

720
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:44,890
Julie Drove
To Your House That Night

721
00:33:44,925 --> 00:33:47,620
To Have... Some Sort
Of Rendezvous With Joe,

722
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,990
And Something Went
Horribly Awry.

723
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,626
My Husband
Would Never Cheat On Me.

724
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:53,880
I Know That This Is
A Lot To Take In,

725
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,055
But If You'll Just
Hear Me Out, Please.

726
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,000
Go Ahead.

727
00:33:58,018 --> 00:33:59,939
But This Whole
Cheating Thing Is Crazy.

728
00:34:01,199 --> 00:34:04,957
We've Discovered That
Julie Regularly Picked Up

729
00:34:04,992 --> 00:34:06,805
A Prescription
For Rasagiline.

730
00:34:07,033 --> 00:34:08,454
The Prescription Was In
Your Son Johnny's Name,

731
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:10,316
But It Was Really For Joe.

732
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,547
Rasagiline Is A Drug

733
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:16,023
That Is Used To Treat
Parkinson's Disease.

734
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,263
It Seems
That The Only Person

735
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:21,355
That He Trusted With
That Information Was Julie.

736
00:34:22,835 --> 00:34:25,402
No, I Was The One
Who Talked Our Family Doctor

737
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,088
Into Putting The Prescription
In Our Son's Name.

738
00:34:28,123 --> 00:34:32,134
So... You Knew
Joe Had Parkinson's?

739
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:33,826
Of Course I Did.
I Was His Wife.

740
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,980
Joe Wanted To Keep Playing,

741
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,584
But The League Never Would've
Let Him If They Had Known.

742
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,478
It Was My Duty
To Make It Happen.

743
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,760
I Should Get Home
And Be With My Boys.

744
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,969
They're Gonna Be Devastated.

745
00:34:51,004 --> 00:34:53,011
Julie Was Family.

746
00:34:53,012 --> 00:34:53,836
Of Course.

747
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,067
Just One More Thing--

748
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,731
The Press Conference That Was
Scheduled For Tomorrow?

749
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:07,611
What About It? He Was Gonna
Announce His New Contract.

750
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,215
I Think He Was Going To
Announce To The World

751
00:35:09,266 --> 00:35:10,578
That He Had Parkinson's.

752
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,725
Joe Wanted To Stand Up
And Be Counted.

753
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,923
That's The Kind Of Man
That He Wa Wasn't He?

754
00:35:17,766 --> 00:35:19,420
Wait, Uh, I'm Sorry.

755
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:21,707
There Is One More Thing
That We Should Discuss.

756
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:23,533
What?

757
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,296
Your Confession.

758
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,315
Have A Seat.

759
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,365
<I>Well, The Good News Is
Joe Wasn't Cheating On You.</I>

760
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:41,766
<I>I Told You That.</I>

761
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:43,365
But He Did Share
A Lot With Julie...

762
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,120
At Night, When She Was
Up With Your Kids

763
00:35:46,121 --> 00:35:48,888
And You Were Knocked Out
On Sleeping Pills.

764
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,033
For Example, Joe Told Her
That He Was Afraid

765
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:54,694
You Wouldn't Stick With Him
Once Things Got Rough.

766
00:35:54,729 --> 00:35:56,597
Joe Was Still
In Great Shape.

767
00:35:56,632 --> 00:35:58,197
He Was Working Out
Harder Than Ever.

768
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,000
I Know. His Stats Actually
Went Up This Year...

769
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:03,237
Six Years, I Try To Get Her
To Watch Football.

770
00:36:03,272 --> 00:36:04,362
One Dead Body,

771
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:06,794
Suddenly She's An Expert
On The Game.

772
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:10,473
"Expert" Might Be
Too Strong A Word.

773
00:36:10,508 --> 00:36:12,665
She Still Hasn't Figured Out
That Once You're Benched

774
00:36:12,766 --> 00:36:14,740
And A New Starter's
Been Named,

775
00:36:14,766 --> 00:36:17,346
You Might On Occasion
Make It Back Into The Game,

776
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:19,784
But, Uh
It's Probably Better

777
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,943
If You Move On
To A New Team.

778
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,183
<I>Sooner Or Later,</I>

779
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:29,332
You Were Gonna
Have To Take Care Of Him

780
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:31,133
In All Sorts
Of Unglamorous Ways,

781
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,066
And You Just Didn't
Sign Up For That.

782
00:36:33,267 --> 00:36:35,200
If You Didn't Get Out Now,
Before He Became

783
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,320
A Public Spokesperson
For His Illness,

784
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,000
Well, Then When Could You?

785
00:36:39,033 --> 00:36:40,727
I Mean,
Come On, Grieving Widow...

786
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,019
Heartless Bitch Who Left
Her Sick Husband.
You Yourself Said

787
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,411
That You Have Julie's Car

788
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:48,196
Driving Into
The Neighborhood.

789
00:36:48,367 --> 00:36:48,766
<I>Julie's, Not Mine.</I>

790
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,802
I Think With A Little
Video Enhancement

791
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:53,564
We'll Be Able To See

792
00:36:53,567 --> 00:36:56,332
That That's You Behind
The Wheel, Not Julie.

793
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,830
<I>I've Been Thinking A Lot
About Something Lately--</I>

794
00:37:01,865 --> 00:37:04,000
<I>(Sighs) Mistakes...</I>

795
00:37:04,001 --> 00:37:07,100
<I>Some Of 'Em
You Can Get Past.</I>

796
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:09,233
<I>They'll Eat You Alive
For A While,</I>

797
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:13,999
<I>But... Eventually
They Just Fade Away.</I>

798
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,621
<I>Murder...</I>

799
00:37:14,622 --> 00:37:17,578
<I>Is Not One Of Those Mistakes.</I>

800
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,200
This Is The Knife We Found
Next To Joe's Body.

801
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:25,537
It Has A Little Imprint
On The Handle.

802
00:37:25,572 --> 00:37:27,476
You Can Hardly See It,
But Goshen Catering

803
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,294
Puts Those On Their Knives
As An Identifier

804
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:31,551
So They Can Distinguish

805
00:37:31,552 --> 00:37:33,000
Their Knives
From Their Clients.

806
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:36,205
Well, We Must Have Used Them
For Some Other Event.

807
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,302
They--They Left It
At The House.

808
00:37:38,337 --> 00:37:40,345
Goshen Catering Worked
The Charity Dinner

809
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,011
That You Attended
The Night That Joe Died.

810
00:37:42,167 --> 00:37:43,156
Their Inventory List

811
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:44,903
Says That This Is
The Knife They're Missing.

812
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,862
<I>Well, Anybody At That Party
Could've Taken It. They--</I>

813
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:49,948
You Stole The Knife,
You Took Julie's Car

814
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,452
And You Drove Home To Surprise
Joe With A Nightcap.

815
00:37:53,487 --> 00:37:54,000
And You Know What?

816
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:56,309
He Was Probably
Happy To See You.

817
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,000
You Poured Him
A Spiked Drink,

818
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,885
And When He Was
Too Weak To Fight Back,

819
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,433
You Slit His Wrists.

820
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:09,719
You Killed
Your Children's Father, Parris.

821
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,900
You Confess Now, At Least
They'll Know You're Sorry.

822
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,137
I Want My Lawyer.

823
00:38:24,533 --> 00:38:25,940
Now.

824
00:38:25,975 --> 00:38:27,515
Okay.

825
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,111
Just To Be Clear,

826
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,346
You Are Going To Jail
For The Rest Of Your Life.

827
00:38:34,381 --> 00:38:35,914
When A Judge
Sees This Evidence

828
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,696
And Hears
That You Didn't Confess,

829
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,568
He Will Have About
As Much Sympathy For You

830
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,690
As You Had For Your Husband.

831
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,351
What'd You Do To My Son?

832
00:38:49,534 --> 00:38:51,009
Me? What? Nothing.

833
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,470
He Seems To Be A Little Bit
In Love With You.
We Bonded.

834
00:38:54,534 --> 00:38:55,502
Well, Where Is Everybody?

835
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,045
What Happened
To Celebration Mojitos?

836
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,102
Jill Had Dinner Plans,

837
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:01,528
And Lindsay Disappeared
Once Parris Was Booked.

838
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,468
What's Gonna Happen
To The Donovan Boys?

839
00:39:04,534 --> 00:39:06,723
Moving To Orlando.
At Least They'll Be
With Family.

840
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,344
So You Know How I...

841
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:12,528
Totally Won Maurice's Trust
With My Doe-Eyed Charm

842
00:39:12,563 --> 00:39:15,467
And Razor-Sharp Knowdge
Of Sports Stats?
Mm-Hmm.

843
00:39:15,534 --> 00:39:17,914
He Sent Over Two Box Tickets
To Sunday's Game.

844
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:20,954
Isn't Accepting Gifts
Against Newspaper Policy?

845
00:39:20,989 --> 00:39:23,035
I Thought About That,
But I Don't Really Cover Sports,

846
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,114
So I Don't See It
As A Conflict Of Interest.
Nice Rationalization There,
Skipper.

847
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:27,677
You'll Think So, Too,
When I Tell You

848
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,881
That I, Um...

849
00:39:31,966 --> 00:39:35,078
I Want To Give The Tickets
To Nate And Ed.

850
00:39:36,534 --> 00:39:41,366
You Know, Fathers, Sons,
Football--It's A Thing.

851
00:39:41,401 --> 00:39:43,748
So Now My Husband's Gonna Be
In Love With You, Too.

852
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,812
Oh, I'm Glad You're Here.

853
00:39:57,847 --> 00:40:00,418
They're Holding A Table
For Two Off In The Corner--

854
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:01,608
Nice Mood Lighting--

855
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,478
And It Is Perfect.

856
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:07,667
It's One Seat Short.
Luke's Joining Us.

857
00:40:08,435 --> 00:40:11,134
A Threesome. How Sassy.

858
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:13,394
He's In Trouble.

859
00:40:15,052 --> 00:40:16,900
The Hospital Is Trying
To Throw Him Under The Bus,

860
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:18,710
And He Needs The Best Lawyer
In San Francisco.

861
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,799
That's You.

862
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:23,541
This Is True,
But As You Pointed Out,

863
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,450
I Can't Take On
Private Clients.

864
00:40:25,451 --> 00:40:29,189
And As You Pointed Out,
You Can Give Free Advice.

865
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:33,483
In This Case,
You Can Be Puppet Master

866
00:40:33,518 --> 00:40:35,416
To The Hospital Lawyer's
Strings.

867
00:40:38,367 --> 00:40:40,070
Luke Has No Idea
How Bad This Is,

868
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:41,850
And I Don't Want Him To Know.

869
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,827
By The Way, You And Me?
Never Happened.

870
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:46,674
If That's How You Want
To Play It.

871
00:40:46,933 --> 00:40:48,689
I'm Trusting You
With The Man I Love.

872
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,506
Can You Believe I Found Parking
Right Around The Corner?

873
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,830
A San Francisco Miracle.
Hey, Man.
Hi.

874
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,551
Hanson North,
Meet Luke Ben.
Nice To Meet You.

875
00:40:56,799 --> 00:40:58,469
Well, Let's Go
Get That Table.

876
00:40:58,699 --> 00:40:58,966
Sure.

877
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,033
Can You Help A Man Out?

878
00:41:21,433 --> 00:41:22,963
I Thought You Left.

879
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,331
I Needed A Drinking Partner.

880
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:30,808
You Don't Have To
Cheer Me Up, Jacobi.

881
00:41:30,843 --> 00:41:31,433
I'm Okay.

882
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,316
Who Said
This Was About You?
