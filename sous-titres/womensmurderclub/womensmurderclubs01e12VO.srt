00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,100
<i>Streets are dry
after that downpour last night.</i>

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,200
<i>That was heavy, heavy rain
flashing across the bay</i>

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,900
<i>Out to marin count..</i>

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:08,300
I don't know.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,200
I can't talk about sex
with claire or cindy.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,700
And jill-She has sex
with anyone that moves.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,700
Okay, in your experience,
is the third date too soon?

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,300
I don't know either.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,600
<i>...the wrong direction,</i>

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,500
<i>So you think you have
a green light,</i>

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,200
<i>In fact, it's red for you.
California bay college ..Athletic field ...
male victim</i>

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,100
Well, death draws a crowd.

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,300
They're young.
Death is fascinating.

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,900
Started out
a beautiful morning,

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,400
But not for him.

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,900
Colin morse, 20,
still soaked from the rain.

17
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,200
2 shots to the chest
between midnight and 2:00.

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,100
- He jogs at midnight?
- Field house custodian found him,

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,200
I.D.'Ed him,
said he always ran at midnight.

20
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,400
And, uh...
one of the entry wounds

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,500
Has powder burns.

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Someone put a gun right against
this kid's chest and fired.

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,500
That's angry.

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,700
I'm so over being nostalgic
about college.

25
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,300
Claire says pete bought you
flowers and dinner at aqua.

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,100
You know, it's scary.
He's just... he's too wonderful.

27
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,200
What's going on?

28
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,200
The dead guy was accused of rape
a couple of months ago.

29
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,800
- I don't remember the case.
- There was no case.

30
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,400
- They arrested him and a friend. D.A. Never filed.
- So the boys just walked.

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,700
I guess everyone disagreed
about what happened,

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,800
Like whether or not the girl
was telling the truth.

33
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,400
Looks like people
still disagree.

Colin morse-
He's the dead kid.

38
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,500
And the girl is?

39
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,500
Hammond, kate.

40
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,700
Which dorm?

41
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,900
All right. Thanks.

42
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,300
Now if you were raped

43
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,200
And they didn't charge
the guy,

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
How would you feel?

45
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,100
Not angry enough
to kill him.

46
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,100
Are you sure?

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,000
Please...

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,100
Don't make me
talk about that night.

49
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,100
We want to hear your side
of what happened.

50
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,100
They raped me.
That's my side.

51
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,800
It's the most...
horrible thing ever.

52
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,900
It happens to other people,
not you.

53
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,400
I remember them
taking me down the stairs...

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,200
I remember
i didn't want to go,

55
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,800
But i was drunk...

56
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,800
And i couldn't stop them.

57
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,500
We understand
the district attorney

58
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,800
- Didn't file charges.
- They said i'd have been a bad witness

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,500
Because i was drunk.

60
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,900
Where were you
last night, kate?

61
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,600
Oh, wow. No.

62
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,700
You guys think
i killed colin.

63
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,400
We have to ask.

64
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,900
What happened to you
is horrifying, but-

65
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,300
That night
with colin and jay...

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,900
It's not just about
what happened

67
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,900
Or how it happened.

68
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,900
It's what you feel
every day,

69
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,100
And you wonder

70
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,400
If you're ever gonna stop
thinking about it.

71
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,700
You're a strong girl.
You'll get through this.

72
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,700
I'm not glad he's dead,
but i wanted him alive.

73
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,200
I wanted to see colin pay-

74
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,300
Something, anything.

75
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
Now i'm not gonna get
that chance.

76
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,400
My parents convinced me
to sue them, you know?

77
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,700
Make them pay.

78
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,000
We hate to ask,
um, we really do,

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,400
But where were you
last night?

80
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,700
At a dorm party
with, like, a hundred people.

81
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,500
I'll write down
the ones i remember.

82
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,400
My friends don't treat me
the same way as they used to.

83
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,300
Even my parents don't.

84
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,100
They don't see me anymore.

85
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,700
They just see what happened.

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,100
She said she wanted
him alive. Did she?

87
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,300
I don't know.

88
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,000
Since when did you
walk away from a suspect

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,200
Without an opinion?

90
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,600
I don't have opinions.
I have theories.

91
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,900
All right, i'm listening.

92
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,400
One thing i know,
whoever shot colin morse,

93
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,900
It's connected to this rape.

94
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,200
I want to talk to this guy
she accused-Jay osborne.

95
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,000
Look, it-It wasn't rape.

96
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,900
Let's be honest.
I'm a good-Looking guy.

97
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,600
I don't have to rape anyone.

98
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,300
I think kate hammond
would disagree.

99
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,300
Okay, look, morning after,

100
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,500
She's hung over,
feeling a little guilty

101
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,600
About some of the choices
that she made,

102
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,700
That gets around,
she cries rape.

103
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And now look what's happened.

104
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,700
What do you
think's happened, jay?

105
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,400
Colin is my best friend.

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,200
I mean was.

107
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,500
No one had a reason
to kill him except...

108
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,600
Kate hammond.

109
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,500
"Rape victim kills rapist,"
that's the story.

110
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,400
Not yet, it isn't. We don't
know if she killed him.

111
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,400
- Do we think she was raped?
- Personally? Yeah. She's 18.

112
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,900
There's no upside for her,
unless she's crazy,

113
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,700
Which she isn't.

114
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,900
I read an interview
in the campus paper.

115
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,800
She doesn't sound like
some pathetic creature

116
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,000
- Who needs attention.
- Don't bring out the feminist guns.

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,300
I'm not a feminist.

118
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,100
Maybe i am,
but it's not important.

119
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,100
Look, the cops interviewed
kate hammond today.

120
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,800
It's all over the net.
There are gonna be protests

121
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,800
- About why these boys weren't prosecuted.
- There's the story the d.A.S didn't do their job.

122
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,500
- Really?
- You brought it up.

123
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,100
I want this
on the web site today.

124
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,500
I really hope
this girl didn't do it.

125
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,300
It'lmake
the d.A.'S office look awful.

126
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,600
Then you better
cover your ears.

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,600
All right, the first one-
To the liver.

128
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,900
The bullet travels straight.

129
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,700
Now if i walk up to you
with a gun...

130
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,000
What do you do?

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,300
Take out mine.

132
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,900
In this case,
you don't have one.

133
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,800
You either run,
or involuntarily back away.

134
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,300
He didn't do either.

135
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,900
Colin definitely knew
his attacker.

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So whoever did it
shot once,

137
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,800
Watched him fall,
then bent down

138
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,600
Put the gun
against his chest...

139
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,200
Linz, tell me there's another
suspect besides the girl.

140
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,800
Not yet.

141
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,200
You just said
"whoever shot him."

142
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,700
Usually we assume "he" shot him
'cause it's mostly men.

143
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,800
Sometimes we say "she"
if we think it's a woman.

144
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
You said "whoever."

145
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
What's wrong with that?

146
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,500
I'm asking you a question,
and you know it.

147
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,900
Did the girl kill him?

148
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,400
Let's hope not.

149
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
If you're thinking
there's even a chance

150
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,100
That girl did it,

151
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,900
- Don't say it outside this building.
- I wouldn't do that anyway.

152
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,800
Jacobi will find out
her alibi is good,

153
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,100
The search warrant
turned up nothing,

154
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,500
And we can all move on.

155
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,500
- How's pete? Sleep with him yet?
- Don't be shy or anything.

156
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,100
- Get it over with. You'll feel better.
- Jill.

157
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,900
Have you seen this?

158
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,700
Your pal cindy
on the "register's" web site-

159
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,900
Says if kate hammond
killed the boy,

160
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,400
It's because
we didn't do our job.

161
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,500
- It probably doesn't say that exactly.
- Really? Read the article.

162
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,000
"Failure of the justice system-
Should they have prosecuted?"

163
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:21,900
Cut her off.

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,700
This piece is irresponsible,

165
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,300
Like some grade-B law professor
knows how to do my job.

166
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,900
Actually, he teaches
at stanford. Hi.

167
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,500
I called you for a comment.
You didn't return my call.

168
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,800
A paragraph in, you're saying
by not prosecuting colin morse,

169
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,400
Our office got him killed.

170
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,700
<i>If it was kate hammond
who pulled the trigger.</i>

171
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,400
<i>If she did, it has
nothing to do with us.</i>

172
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,100
There was no case
to prosecute.

173
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,700
The rape kit
showed no bruising.

174
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,000
Kate hammond-She-She made out
with five guys in one night.

175
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,400
She drank whiskey
out of a shot glass

176
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,000
Balanced on a boy's crotch.

177
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,200
All we had
was a rape counselor

178
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Who believed
she was traumatized.

179
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,300
And kate.
You had her testimony.

180
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,400
I don't have to defend
this office to you.

181
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,300
The system
failed kate hammond.

182
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,800
Cindy,
even if that was true,

183
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,200
And-And we don't know
that it is,

184
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,100
- It doesn't justify killing the guy.
- And did we put her in that position?

185
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,800
It sounds terrible,
but what was she thinking,

186
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,500
Going down to the basement
with two boys...

187
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,800
- Wait a minute.
- With her blouse half off?

188
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,500
What are you saying?
She was asking for it?

189
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,500
- That's outrageous.
- Okay, okay, enough round one-Over.

190
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,700
Let's go.

191
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,400
She's way overreacting.

192
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,300
That was fairly strange.

193
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,500
Kate hammond
is a suspect, right?

194
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,500
No comment.

195
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,300
Night, linz.

196
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
You okay?

197
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,700
I'm fine.

198
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,700
Hey, you remember
the kendall case?

199
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,500
The... security guard

200
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,200
Who shot the drug dealer
for harassing his wife?

201
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,500
Yeah, you told me about it
on our second date.

202
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,600
One thing
i never told you about.

203
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,700
We went to arrest kendall
at his house.

204
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,900
His kids were playing
in the front hall,

205
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,400
His wife...

206
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,000
There was toys
all over the place.

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,100
And i looked at him,

208
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,800
And i knew
that this was a decent guy

209
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,200
Who made one mistake

210
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,200
When he was protecting
his wife against garbage.

211
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,600
But it was a homicide.

212
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,400
Anyway...
i went back to my car,

213
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,900
And i cried, linz.

214
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,300
I sat there alone
behind the wheel

215
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,500
And i cried.

216
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,500
I did what i had to do,

217
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,600
But i didn't like doing it.

218
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,700
You've been down here
for half an hour.

219
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This is about the girl.

220
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah. It's about the girl.

221
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
They raped her.

222
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,500
And odds are, she killed him,
and if she did...

223
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,400
I don't want to be the one
that puts her away.

224
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,700
If she killed him...

225
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,900
You'll do what you do.

226
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Night.

227
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,000
Hey, boxer.

228
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,700
How was your evening
last night?

229
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,900
Good morning.
What's that about?

230
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,800
The guys
are running a pool...

231
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,200
On whether you slept with
your boyfriend yet.

232
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,200
That's incredibly offensive.

233
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,400
Did you pick yes or no?

234
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,000
I only bet on sure things.

235
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,100
Where are we
on the girl's alibi?

236
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,600
Well, kate hammond went to
a dorm party-

237
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,000
Easily a hundred people.

238
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,800
We found 41,
all of them saw kate,

239
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,500
And our interviews put her
there until after 2:00 a.M.

240
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,600
41 drunk kids is something
short of an ironclad alibi.

241
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,800
Well, out of the 41,
only 8 really matter.

242
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,700
These were taken from
eight kids' cell phones.

243
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,500
Each is a photo of kate.
They were all taken

244
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,000
Before midnight
until just after 2:00.

245
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
- Not more than 19 minutes between any of 'em.
- How far was the party from the track?

246
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,500
Under half a mile.

247
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,300
That's plenty of time
to leave the party,

248
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,900
- Kill him and get back.
- There's one minor problem.

249
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,700
It was pouring rain.

250
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,200
She's not wet
in any of those pictures,

251
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,500
And her hair is the same.

252
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,600
So she has to walk or drive
half a mile.

253
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,500
If she drives,
there can't be any traffic.

254
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
She has to shoot him,
get back,

255
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,500
Not get her clothes wet

256
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,300
Or change into
identical clothes

257
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,500
And keep her hair dry
and do it all in 19 minutes.

258
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,600
- It's impossible.
- I thought you believed she did it.

259
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,500
I did.

260
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,300
So did i,
and all i be thinking is,

261
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,500
If it turns out she killed him,
i understand.

262
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,300
Somebody laid a hand
on my daughter,

263
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,100
I'd sure want to go out
and shoot him.

264
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,400
Which raises
a very interesting question.

265
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,500
Kate hammond's father
was on the news this morning.

266
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,600
The parents came to town
after the rape accusation.

267
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,300
And they're here again

268
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,800
Do you own
a gun, mr. Hammond?

269
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,600
Your neighbors in phoenix

270
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,200
Aren't sure
when you left town.

271
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,900
I coulda killed
the little scum, but no,

272
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
I don't own a gun.

273
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,500
I never have.

274
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,100
You know, the death
of this young man

275
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,800
Brought this back
for all of us.

276
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,900
We understand.

277
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,400
After the rape,

278
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,000
Kate couldn't focus
on her classes.

279
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,100
She lost her boyfriend.

280
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,900
From gas stations
along the way,

281
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,100
In case you...
need to check.

282
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,200
We're talking to anyone
who might have insight

283
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,500
Into this murder.

284
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,900
Um, katie's boyfriend-
Charlie gifford-

285
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,600
He was interviewed
at the time of the rape?

286
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,200
Charlie... was the strength
in katie's life.

287
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,700
And charlie
couldn't kill anyone,

288
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,100
If that's what you mean.

289
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,500
You're trying hard
with this sensitivity.

290
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
But you know what?
You're full of it.

291
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,600
We're just doing
our job, mr. Hammond.

292
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,400
If you were
doing your job,

293
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,600
Those two boys
would be in jail.

294
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,300
I loved kate.
She was it for me.

295
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,500
Charlie, you told
the original investigators

296
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,300
That you were with kate
the night of the rape,

297
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,600
But that you left early.

298
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,200
A stupid fight
over nothing,

299
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,000
About getting a place
off campus.

300
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,500
Kate was worried
i'd get sick of her

301
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,600
If we lived together.

302
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
If i'd stayed that night...

303
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,100
The rape
would've never happened.

304
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,500
You broke up after that?

305
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,900
It was toxic.

306
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,800
She was angry,
and i didn't know what to do.

307
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,500
I mean, we couldn't even
look at each other.

308
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,300
Where were you
two nights ago?

309
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,200
I was in mroom studying.
Why?

310
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,200
Do you guys realize
what you're doing,

311
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,300
Accusing kate and me,

312
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,000
You guys are ruining our lives
all over again.

313
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,000
Now we've covered every
shooting range in 100 miles.

314
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,500
Nobody recognizes kate
or charlie from their photos.

315
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,400
If they got gun savvy,
we have no idea how,

316
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,900
And charlie was in his dorm.

317
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,500
He swiped his entry card
at, uh, 9:35.

318
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,300
Half a dozen people saw him
over the next couple of hours.

319
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,500
You saw the rape file.
Charlie feels guilty

320
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,600
About leaving kate
at that frat house.

321
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,000
If he wanted
to kill colin morse,

322
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,600
He could've done it.

323
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,000
He could've found a way to leave
his dorm without being seen.

324
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't think so.
Is charlie emotionally capable

325
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,800
Of shooting colin
and bending down,

326
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,600
- Firing into his chest? No.
- I'm with you. I don't think the kid has it in him.

327
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Where does that leave us?

328
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,100
Without a suspect.

329
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Linz...
you got company.

330
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,700
Hi.

331
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,800
I, uh, i didn't want to wait
till tomorrow to see you.

332
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
I hope you don't mind.

333
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,200
Well, i'm terribly annoyed
you didn't speak

334
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,700
With my social secretary.

335
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,100
You want to, uh,
you want to split a muffin?

336
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,300
Yeah.

337
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,600
We only have another week.

338
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,700
I want as much lindsay time
as i can get.

339
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,300
Well, don't go
to phnom penh,

340
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,500
And then you can have
as much as you like.

341
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,700
I have
10 square miles waiting

342
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,700
For the most incredible
hotel complex in the world.

343
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,900
San francisco
could use more hotels.

344
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,400
That has occurred to me.

345
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Are you gonna
keep bothering my family?

346
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm sorry that you think
we're bothering you.

347
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,200
This is
a homicide investigation, kate.

348
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm not trying to hurt
your family or you.

349
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,000
You pretend like it bothers you
to question me and my parents

350
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,200
When you're just looking
to solve your case.

351
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,000
Don't you have any shame?

352
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,300
Let's go, kate.

353
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,200
If it's any consolation,
that wasn't about you.

354
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,800
I'm not so sure.

355
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,400
You spend your whole life
trying to do the right thing,

356
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,000
And sometimes
you have to wonder,

357
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,500
Is-Is doing the right thing
the right thing to do?

358
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,100
What?

359
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,300
Lindsay,
i get up every day

360
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,700
And have to believe

361
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,100
I do what i do better than
anyone in the world.

362
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,500
It's completely crazy,
and i can't help it.

363
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,700
But you, you-You demand
perfection of yourself

364
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,300
Like no one
i have ever seen.

365
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,700
I- I don't want to be
a perfect person.

366
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I know you don't want
to be a perfect person.

367
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,200
You want to be a perfect cop,
and even if you were, linz,

368
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,900
You'd still feel bad
right now.

369
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,700
You wanted a suspect?

370
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,500
Amateur video hour.
You'll love this.

371
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,600
Who's the amateur?

372
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,200
There's two of 'em-
Our victim, colin morse,

373
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,100
And his pal jay osborne.

374
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,100
He's the other kid that
kate hammond is accusing.

375
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,000
Couple of our inspectors
down in evidence

376
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,000
Went through the dvds
that we found

377
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,700
When we searched
colin's room.

378
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,900
Don't tell me they
taped themselves raping her.

379
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,100
No, not that good,
but almost.

380
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,400
<i>Then jay said, "i have another
bottle in the basement."</i>

381
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,500
Now that's colin morse, trying
to get his story straight.

382
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,200
<i>No, no, no, no, i was
already in the basement,</i>

383
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,500
<i>Watching the postgame.</i>

384
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,100
<i>She invited you
to come downstairs.</i>

385
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,000
<i>- That's jay osborne.
- Concentrate...</i>

386
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,500
My god, they're practicing
testimony for the civil suit.

387
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,000
They're practicing how to lie.

388
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,800
<i>So i took her down there-</i>

389
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,500
<i>Okay, listen, listen,
listen,</i>

390
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,000
<i>You've gotta get this right.</i>

391
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,300
<i>If we lose this case,
we are finished-</i>

392
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,700
<i>Me, you, our parents-
They're gonna clean us out.</i>

393
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,000
<i>- So i'm gonna give you this tape...
- Jay wanted colin to perform better,</i>

394
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,300
So he made the disc so colin
could study his mistakes.

395
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,900
Obviously they lied
about the rape,

396
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,700
But that
doesn't prove anything.

397
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,200
It proves they raped her

398
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,400
- And were afraid of making
mistakes in court.
- To you and me.

399
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,900
- It's not enough for a jury.
- They don't say "tell a lie."

400
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,000
They don't say "no, no,
no, no, tell a lie better."

401
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,500
- They just rehearse.
-But you heard what jay osborne said.

402
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,800
He was afraid his life
would be ruined.

403
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,100
He was afraid that colin would
blow it on the witness stand.

404
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,200
That's a motive for murder.

405
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,600
Jill, okay, this isn't
evidence of murder,

406
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,700
But it's evidence
they raped her.

407
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,800
Is it enough to pick up jay
and scare him?

408
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,900
Jill?

409
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,200
No. No, it's not enough.

410
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,400
What the hell was that?

411
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
I owe your neighbors
an apology.

412
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,000
Martha barked
for half an hour

413
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,100
When i got here.

414
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,100
Why'd you run out on us?

415
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,500
You know why i snapped
at cindy?

416
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,600
It's not her
i'm angry at. It's me.

417
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,400
What are you talking about?

418
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,000
Two months ago...

419
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,900
The d.A.'S
weekly conference-

420
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,300
We decide which cases
go to the grand jury.

421
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,700
Kate hammond's case
came up.

422
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,800
Consensus was there was
no point going to trial.

423
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,000
I said...

424
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Nothing.

425
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,400
The case was unwinnable

426
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,200
Based on what you knew
at the time.

427
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,700
I forgot she was
this little girl

428
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,700
Who got drunk

429
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,900
And didn't know
what she was getting into.

430
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,100
You were doing your job.

431
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,900
She wanted to testify.

432
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,300
How many women want to face
their attackers?

433
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,400
I should've stood up
for kate hammond's right to a day in court.

434
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,100
We owed her that.

435
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,600
I made a mistake.

436
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm gonna do
everything i can to fix it.

437
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,000
Counselor,what are you doing here
at 6:00 in the morning?

438
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,700
I need a warrant signed, judge,
and you're always in early.

439
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,900
Jay osborne...
the hammond rape...

440
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,600
Search warrant. Huh.

441
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
Do you really have
probable cause for murder?

442
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
This one time,
if you could do me a favor,

443
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,400
I admit it's a stretch.
We might get slammed on appeal.

444
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,700
Let 'em try.

445
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,600
I hate rapists.

446
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,000
Do those latex gloves
dry out your skin?

447
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,800
You can always tell how old a person is
by the way that their hands look.

448
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,850
Jay, question-Colin never came home
from running the other night,

449
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,000
And his room's right next door.

450
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,300
Didn't you notice that?
I was asleep.

451
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,200
You guys must be really desperate for suspects
if you think that i shotim.

452
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,200
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

453
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,600
These are my meds
for asthma.

454
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,000
Breathe deep.

455
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,500
Hey, you gotta leave me
my meds.

456
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,400
There's a drug store
around the corner.

457
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,500
Jay's ticket stubs-

458
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,100
First-Class airfare...

459
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,600
Ski lift tickets,

460
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,600
Aspen and vail.

461
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,400
Alibi for time of death?

462
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,300
He was asleep.

463
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,200
That's why he didn't realize
colin was missing.

464
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,700
Interesting.

465
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,400
His meds are the only thing
he got excited about.

466
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,600
What kind of asthma meds
need an eyedropper?

467
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,600
Odorless...

468
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,000
And clear.

469
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,000
What you found was definitely
gamma hydroxybutyrate.

470
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,200
G.H.B.-
Date rape drug of choice.

471
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,800
Gas chromatography-
On the left,

472
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,800
The liquid you found
in jay osborne's room,

473
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,800
On the right,
pharmaceutical quality g.H.B.

474
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,300
They look close,
but not exact.

475
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Why would there be
a difference?

476
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,000
Jay's was homemade.

477
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,100
Coulda whipped it up
in a chem lab.

478
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,600
The dead kid-Colin morse-
Was a chemical engineering major.

479
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,200
They doped her.

480
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,500
They drugged her
so she wouldn't resist.

481
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,100
No wonder there wasn't
any bruising.

482
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,700
Not for publication.

483
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,300
Linz, there was no g.H.B.
In the blood sample

484
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,200
From kate hammond's rape kit.

485
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,500
Those boys made it.
They used it.

486
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,100
I'll test it again.

487
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,100
I gotta go.

488
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,800
Now look at these.

489
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,000
This slug came
from colin morse.

490
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,600
And this identical slug
was found in the wall

491
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,700
After a liquor store shoot-Up
three weeks ago.

492
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,600
So two diffe crimes,
same gun.

493
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,400
Who was the shooter
in the liquor store holdup?

494
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,200
Robbery division suspects
a guy named, uh, leon perker.

495
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,600
He's got a sheet full of armed robbery
and felony drug sales.

496
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,600
Now the liquor store
matched his m.O.

497
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,300
But the clerk
couldn't i.D. Him,

498
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,000
And when they picked up leon,
he didn't have the gun on him.

499
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,800
An armed robber
and a drug dealer.

500
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,000
Does he shoot a kid
on a running track at midnight?

501
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,400
I doubt leon
shot colin morse.

502
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,800
So our friend leon must have sold his
gun to someone.

503
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,300
Who used it to kill colin.

504
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,000
Let's arrest mr. Perker,and then we roll him
and find out who he sold the gun to.

505
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,200
Arrest him for what?

506
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,400
Leon perker.

507
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,300
Boxer, jacobi-
S.F.P.D.

508
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,100
We're looking for a gun,
a.38. Sell one recently?

509
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,200
I don't mess with weaponry.

510
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,800
Why don't you lose grandpa?

511
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,800
Take a seat,

512
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,000
And the three of us
can have some fun.

513
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,400
Is that so? You're pretty hot for a cop,

514
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,900
Just like my girl here.

515
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,500
He's right, rita. You do look good.

516
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,400
Thanks, lindsay.
Yeah, i know your date.

517
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,000
Officer howe and i
work together.

518
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,600
She didn't tell you that when she was buying
your smack, did she?

519
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,400
So, leon... we gonna
take you in for a drug felony,

520
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,300
Or are you gonna tell us who
you sold a gun to?

521
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,600
<i>Don't put your hand on that.
I have my hand on mine.</i>

522
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,600
He has his hand on his. Come on.

523
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,500
All right, turn around, put your hands on the bar
where i can see 'em. Oh, man.

524
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,900
Leon perker, you are under
arrest for terminal stupidity.

525
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,600
I'm having trouble
seeing this.

526
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,500
A guy selling drugs,

527
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,700
And you're getting ready
to pull a gun?

528
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,300
I'm sorry. You probably don't
want to hear about this.

529
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,700
No, no, it's-
It's incredible, really.

530
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,600
I'm really glad you're here.

531
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,600
I would... much rather
be thinking about you than...

532
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,200
And this place is mess.

533
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,800
I am so sorry.
I should, um...

534
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,100
Would you stop apologizing?

535
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,500
I just...

536
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,200
What?

537
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,400
I just wanted this
to be special.

538
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
It is.

539
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,400
* oh *

540
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,200
* so many people *

541
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,500
* think we've got it wrong *

542
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
* they all try to break us *

543
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,900
* but we won't play along *

544
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,100
* so let's get *

545
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,000
* down and dirty, baby *

546
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,900
* let's get restless, baby *

547
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,000
* come on, get crazy with me *

548
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,300
* and i said *

549
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,700
* when you're loving me *

550
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,700
* i'm loving you *

551
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,400
You went and got coffee?

552
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,200
Actually, i flew to colombia
and back for fresh beans.

553
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,600
These early morning flights
to south america are brutal.

554
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,600
Also, breakfast treats
for the girl who loves scones-

555
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,700
Scones-

556
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,300
And a snack for martha.

557
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,800
Yeah. There you go.

558
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,400
She says thanks.

559
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,500
And me, too. Thank you.

560
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,400
You, uh, you sleep okay?

561
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,000
You tossed a lot.

562
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,700
Yeah, i do that.

563
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
Uh, you?

564
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,900
I nodded in and out.

565
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,500
You okay with last night?

566
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,900
Mm-Hmm.

567
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,800
Uh, y-Yeah. It was...

568
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,400
It was great. Why?

569
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,100
Well, when i, uh, got here,
we were having dinner,

570
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,900
You... well, you seemed
a little nervous.

571
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,800
Um... i haven't felt

572
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Things like this in-
Inong... time.

573
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,300
Me, too. Totally.
Really?

574
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Yeah. Yeah.

575
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,300
Yeah, i can get nervous.

576
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,350
I don't, like... meet anybody,
you know, like this. I...

577
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,700
And then maybe
there's always, you know,

578
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,500
The-The first time being here
in your apartment.

579
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,700
Yeah, it's-
It's been a while, you know.

580
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,700
Yeah, and martha watching.

581
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,300
And i'd just come from
bringing in a suspect...

582
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,700
Yeah, i'm sure it's
one of the above.

583
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,200
Or... all of the above.
All of the above, yeah.

584
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,300
It was so great.

585
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,600
I hope it wasn't too soon.

586
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,700
It-It really was great.

587
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,200
And-And it couldn't be
too soon.

588
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,600
How much longer could we wait?
U're leaving in a week.

589
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,400
Hey, leon took the deal.

590
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,400
We drop the drugs,
he goes down for the gun.

591
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,100
And we get a lineup?

592
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,100
Five young men
in skullcaps.

593
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,000
And leon's description of the young man
who bought the gun

594
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,800
Sounds a lot likjay osborne.

595
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,400
You take your time,
get it right.

596
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,600
Not here.

597
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,000
This some sort of trick
or something?

598
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,800
No, this is no trick,
and don't try one on us.

599
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,300
I got a keen memory.

600
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,700
The kid that approached me,
none of these are him.

601
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,300
There's no tattoo.

602
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
What tattoo?

603
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,800
Spiky fence on the wrist.

604
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,200
Take leon back to holding.

605
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,300
Kate's ex-Boyfriend charlie
has a tattoo on his wrist.

606
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,600
Pick him up.

607
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,800
Heads-Up.
50 reporters outside.

608
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,200
Jay osborne and his lawyer
are holding a press conference
in a half an hour.

609
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,800
It's all over cable news.
We just did the lineup.

610
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,500
How'd they get
the reporters here so fast?

611
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,800
It's a setup. Jay's lawyer
invited them before the lineup.

612
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,500
He knew his client was gonna walk.
They're making him a victim.

613
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,700
They'll say he was
accused of rape and murder-

614
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,400
Accused twice,
innocent twice.

615
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,600
Mm-Hmm,
and that kind of publicity?

616
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,400
Kate hammond doesn't win
her civil suit.

617
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,500
Today's press conference brought
to you by barnum & bailey.

618
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,000
Anybody bring popcorn?

619
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,300
Ladies and gentlemen,
in what anyone would call a travesty of justice...

620
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,200
Go knock him down
a peg or two.

621
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,000
Oh, i will bring
the heated questions.

622
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,500
Then we'll take questions.

623
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,500
I'm sorry for that poor girl
kate hammond

624
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,800
And my friend colin,
who i miss every day...

625
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,900
He's gonna miss the ne 20 years of his life
when we nail him for rape.

626
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Add five years for drugging her.

627
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,200
Amen.

628
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,000
We sent two guys over
to pick up the ex-Boyfriend.

629
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,600
My stomach'll turn if i have to
listen to this kid for one more minute.

630
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,900
Wait, wait. When did
they leave to arrest charlie?

631
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,900
You raped her, you son of a bit! No!

632
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,400
Stay down.
Stay down!

633
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,300
Jay didn't get hit.

634
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
Lindsay!

635
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,800
No, no, no. Cindy!

636
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,600
Cindy.

637
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,100
Code 33,this is 5-Henry-12, 10-25.
Request medical...

638
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,600
Cindy.

639
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,500
Cindy, honey,
can you hear me?

640
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,500
Bullet went past the left lung,
lodged in the intestine.

641
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,000
Missed the abdominal aorta
by what,like 10 millimeters?

642
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,900
Less. Talk about lucky.

643
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,200
Aside from blood loss,
she's fine.

644
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,000
Call if you need me.

645
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,300
Thank you.

646
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,600
I lost my temper
with her.

647
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,800
For reasons
we all can understand.

648
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,500
Anyway, she wouldn't even
be in that bed

649
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,000
If we had the right suspect
in the first place.

650
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,000
I hate to inform both of you
that however much

651
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,200
You want to be in control
of everything, you're not.

652
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,300
Boxer.

653
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,900
Okay.
I'll be right there.

654
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,600
Charlie has a lawyer.
He wants to talk.

655
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,000
Counselor,
you don't seem to understand.

656
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,600
We're not here to discuss
the shting of cindy thomas.

657
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,800
We got 50 eyewitnesses
who saw him do it.

658
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,100
Our ballistics says
the gun used today

659
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,300
Is the same gun that was
used to kill colin morse.

660
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,900
My client's gonna
tell you everything.

661
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,700
<i>Then the d.A., who i assume,
is behind that mirror...</i>

662
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,600
<i>You're about to see this kid hang himself.
Is gonna offer to plead him out.</i>

663
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,100
<i>All morning, i...
i couldn't stand it.</i>

664
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,000
Jay was posting
in a chat room...

665
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,800
He didn't sign it,but...

666
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,400
I knew it was him-

667
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,200
Talking about how kate
was a liar and a slut

668
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,900
And how she begged... them

669
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,900
<i>For sex.</i>

670
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,400
When i saw on tv
about the press conference-

671
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,800
He lost control.

672
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,600
Save it for the jury,
counselor.

673
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,600
So you lost control,
charlie.

674
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,900
They treated kate...

675
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,300
<i>Like meat...</i>

676
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,900
Like she wasn't even human...

677
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,100
Telling the cops
it was consensual,

678
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,500
You know, like she asked
to be raped.

679
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,800
<i>No one defended kate,</i>

680
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,100
Not the police,
not the school, nobody.

681
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,200
So you defended her.

682
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,700
That's right.

683
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,800
I shot him.

684
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,500
He fell down,
and i shot him again.

685
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,800
<i>I put the gun to his chest...</i>

686
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,500
I looked in his eyes

687
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,900
And... i pulled the trigger.

688
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,800
You didn't have to kill him.
Kate was suing.

689
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,400
Why'd you get
in the way of that?

690
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,900
'Cause it's all my fault.

691
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,200
I should've been there
that night with kate,

692
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,100
<i>And none of this
would've happened.</i>

693
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,000
So it had to be me.

694
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,100
It had to be me.

695
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,700
Don't ask me why we're here.
I'll tell you when i know.

696
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,600
Look, the kid confessed.

697
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,600
They book him, we get
a formal confession on tape,

698
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,900
We move on.

699
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,100
What's wrong
with his confession?

700
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,000
<i>I don't know.
I do know.</i>

701
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,100
We have two shootings.
One is careful, planned.

702
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,700
The second one is
so spur of the moment,

703
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,900
He didn't even know
where to point the gun.

704
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,600
I just don't believe
the same person's responsible for both shootings.

705
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,400
And he's
covering for kate hammond?

706
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,200
We walked this, lindsay.
There's no way she gets

707
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,200
From the party to here
and stays dry.

708
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,800
If she walks, she's in
heavy rain for 15 minutes.

709
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,300
You saw those pictures.

710
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,200
She's as dry
as a good martini.

711
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,000
She found a way
to get here and back and stay dry.

712
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,000
How? Was she airlifted?

713
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,400
This might be a good time
to remind you,

714
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,300
We have a confession.

715
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,900
What is that?

716
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,800
What?

717
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,100
Look.

718
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,700
At what?
An underground steam pipe?

719
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,300
There are tons of them.

720
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,500
They're about a foot high,

721
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,700
And they don't run
half a mile between buildings.

722
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,700
If you're thinking
kate hammond

723
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,200
Crawled through a pipe duct,
forget it.

724
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,600
What if it's more
than a steam pipe?

725
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,700
Why do you
want it to be her?

726
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,700
I don't want it to be her.
I just know it is.

727
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,000
And how do you intend
to prove it?

728
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,300
I can't. Yet.

729
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,300
<i>My name is charles gifford,</i>

730
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,400
<i>And i am making this statement
of my own free will.</i>

731
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
<i>I admit that i killed
colin morse,</i>

732
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,600
<i>And i admit...</i>

733
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,400
Hi, kate.

734
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,000
<i>That i attempted
to kill jay osborne.</i>

735
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,100
What's going on?

736
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:26,900
<i>My actions were my own... </i>

737
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,200
We're recording charlie's confession.

738
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,400
<i>I thought you'd want to watch.
And i ted alone.</i>

739
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,600
<i>This is about the shooting yesterday?
I didn't plan on killing colin until</i>

740
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
And colin's murder.
He's confessing to both.

741
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,900
<i>Three or four weeks
after what they did to kate.</i>

742
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,100
<i>I was so angry.
They raped her.</i>

743
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,400
Why is he doing that?

744
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,000
<i>I thought the law
was gonna handle it...</i>

745
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,600
Because he loves you.

746
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,500
My guess, he decided
to take out jay

747
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And take the rap
in one big romantic gesture...

748
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,300
Which would be impressive
if he knew how to shoot a gun.

749
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,900
This isn't right.

750
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,700
I know you did it, kate.

751
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Then you wouldn't let charlie
go to jail, would you?

752
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,900
I know it was you.
I just can't prove it.

753
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,200
I told you, i was
at the party that night.

754
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,400
Yeah,
and that was a challenge.

755
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,300
How'd you shoot colin
and manage to stay dry?

756
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,900
I should've known... better,

757
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,900
But... a 1950s
bomb shelter tunnel?

758
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,000
That's...
that's way before my time.

759
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,900
Even the people
that we asked,

760
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,900
They didn't even know
they were there.

761
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,400
But i found a story about them
in the college archives,

762
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,800
And as it turns out,
one of those tunnels

763
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,400
Goes from the dorm basement
straight to the field house.

764
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,200
Why don't you arrest me?

765
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,000
Because all i have
is a theory.

766
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,400
Charlie's confessed.

767
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
They finish in there,
he goes to prison.

768
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,500
It's all over.

769
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,400
I know something else
about you kate,

770
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,700
About the night
you were raped.

771
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,200
You were drugged.

772
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,500
Colin and jay
gave you g.H.B.

773
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,700
But they tested me
for that.

774
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,400
The g.H.B. That they gave you
didn't show up in the test,

775
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,800
But we know
that they gave it to you.

776
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,400
So, honey,
what happened that night

777
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,100
Was not
because you were drunk

778
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,500
Or irresponsible.

779
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,900
You were just unconscious.

780
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,700
Bastards.

781
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,600
Yeah, that's right.

782
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,300
And i think anyone would understand you
wanting them dead,

783
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,500
But, hey...

784
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,500
After all the lies
that have been told,

785
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,600
After all the lies
that people have believed,

786
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,500
Don't you think
that it's time

787
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,300
That someone started
telling the truth?

788
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,800
N- No one believed me.

789
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,300
They thought
i wanted this to happen.

790
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,400
How'd you do it that night?

791
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,500
I snuck out of the dorm party

792
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,300
And went to the field
and shot colin.

793
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,200
Charlie bought me the gun,

794
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,900
And then he took it from me
afterwards.

795
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,000
I thought it'd be enough
to sue them.

796
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,900
<i>I really did.</i>

797
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,000
Then...
they sent me something.

798
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,900
What did they send you?

799
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,800
A valentine.

800
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,400
It said, "you will be
in our hearts forever."

801
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,500
I knew
i had to do something.

802
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,700
So you shot colin?

803
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,200
I sometimes forget how good you are
in that room.

804
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,300
Good, huh? Right.

805
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,100
I take her in there,i show her charlie,
i make her my friend...

806
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,500
Yeah, i'm a good cop,

807
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,200
But i sometimes wonder
if i'm a good person.

808
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,800
Maybe this will help.

809
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,100
What's this?

810
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,800
An arrest warrant.

811
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,800
You're booking him
on rape?

812
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,300
It's absurd.
You've got no case.

813
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,800
Shut up, jay.
No, i'm quoting the district attorney.

814
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,300
<i>We had no case,</i>

815
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,500
Until we found g.H.B.
In his desk.

816
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,000
The rape kit-There was
no g.H.B. In her blood.

817
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,100
No pharmaceutical grade,
but the boys made home brew.

818
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,600
Degrades differently, takes
a better test. Which she ran.

819
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,300
And since their homemade stuff
has a unique chemical signature,

820
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,300
The g.H.B. Can be traced
to its source.

821
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,500
We can prove you doped kate up,
which corroborates her story.

822
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,400
We're gonna find you
a nice little holding cell.

823
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,500
I- You c-Wait.
Come on.

824
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,300
Jay... your best friend
is dead,

825
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,700
And you're going to jail.
Do you know why?

826
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,000
Because you and colin decided
that if you wanted something,

827
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,700
You could just take it.

828
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,900
You think about that.

829
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,600
I'm gonna take mr. Osborne
down to booking,

830
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,300
Get his picture taken.

831
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,800
You get all the fun jobs.

832
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,700
I lost a whole day.

833
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,900
I don't remember any of it.

834
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,300
You're on painkillers.

835
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,900
You won't remember
any of this either.

836
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,700
Try to remember this.

837
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,900
I owe you an apology.

838
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,700
I was angry at myself,
and i took it out on you.

839
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,600
Thanks.

840
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,900
I'm glad
we got that settled.

841
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,700
I have to go meet pete.

842
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,900
I'm gone a whole day,
and yore still dating.

843
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,200
Well, you know... today.
I'm not promising tomorrow.

844
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,400
Night.

845
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,400
I gotta get home
and look at homework.

846
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,000
Okay.

847
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,500
Are we still friends?

848
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,700
I mean, after the way
i insulted you. I'm...i'm sorry.

849
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,800
Forgiven.

850
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:20,200
If we are friends,

851
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,000
Do you think you could stay
until my parents get here?

852
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,800
Sure.

853
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,000
* i can see
the light begin *

854
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,700
I thought we were meeting
at the restaurant.

855
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,300
Yeah, i didn't want to wait.
I been thinking too much.

856
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,700
What are you thinking about?

857
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,000
About the fact that i'm
leaving in a week, and it...

858
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,700
Changes everything.

859
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,700
Yeah, i know.

860
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,700
So what do you think?

861
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,700
Should we end it now?

862
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,900
*... within *

863
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,300
Might be the smart thing.

864
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,200
Saves a lot of pain
in the end, for both of us

865
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,600
* if there are times
when you need... *

866
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,700
Then again, nobody's ever
called me smart.

867
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,400
Come to think of it,
me neither?

868
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,400
* you can find a place in me *

869
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,900
* and you'll always be free *

870
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,700
* now that you're here *

871
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,100
* i want you to know *

872
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,500
Do you wanna...
come upstairs?

873
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,500
I have some cold pizza
in the fridge.

874
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,000
Yeah, um... can, uh, martha
sleep in another room?

875
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,600
Yeah, i'll talk to her.

876
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,600
Great.

877
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,600
* you'll always be free *

878
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,000
