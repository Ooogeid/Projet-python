00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,800
morning.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,700
hey, what's going on?

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,300
nothing, just thought i'd
stop by on my way to work.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,800
yeah, i'm not due in court
for 20 minutes.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,900
we still haven't heard
about your date.

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,300
oh, please.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,300
lindsay, come back here!

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,200
wait up!

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,200
where are you going?

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,000
i have to talk to claire.

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,400
man, you walk fast.
long legs.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,800
i think somebody doesn't
want to talk about it

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,700
because it went a lot better
than she wants to let on.

15
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,800
did it go a lot better?

16
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,100
oh, all right, you got me.

17
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,300
it might have been the best date
i've ever been on.

18
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,700
we had an unbelievable dinner,

19
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,300
and we talked until they closed
the restaurant,

20
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,400
and then we went home,
and we had sex all night,

21
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,800
and i really and truly believe
this guy is the one.

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,300
oh, defensive sarcasm.
it went well.

23
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,000
very well.

24
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,300
it did not go well.
it did not go anything.

25
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,600
why do you even care?

26
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,700
hey.

27
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,700
hey, guys.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,400
to what do i owe
the pleasure?

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
i'm just here to get some ballistics.
they are not with me.

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,500
oh, okay.

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,000
i take it this means i don't
get to hear about your date.

32
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,100
is this a homicide?
no,

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,500
poor thing died in her sleep
on a plane back from mexico.

34
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,600
autopsy's mandatory becausshe was
returning from a foreign country.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
she looks so peaceful.

36
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,700
nice vacation, a good last meal,
couple drinks on the plane,

37
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,700
and you doze off during an in-flight movie--
not a bad way to go.

38
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,000
i hope i go in my sleep.

39
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,900
i hope i go on top
of clive owen.

40
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,100
you die your way,
i'll die mine.

41
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,300
i don't want to die, period.
why are we even talking about this?

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,500
because you won't talk???

43
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,300
stop it. i'm serious.

44
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,700
oh, my god.

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,100
claire--
not you.

46
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,500
what is that?

47
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,800
it's a drug balloon.

48
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,400
my guess is heroin.

49
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,700
so much for a good last meal.

50
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,300
miss thing's smach's
full of 'em.

53
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,100
rumor is you went on a date.

54
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,100
some of the guys are
asking me if it's true.

55
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,400
they want to know
if they can ask you out.

56
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,900
what, like... (chuckles)
like you're my father,

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,200
and they need your pmission?

58
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,300
tell me
you've never told anyone

59
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,200
they need your permission
to ask me out.

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,600
uh, mr. iverson,
i'm inspector jacobi.

61
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,100
this is inspector boxer.
we spoke on the phone.

62
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,400
please come in.
thank you.

63
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,400
no, no. my mother was 80.

64
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,500
she never drank.
she never smoked.

65
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,400
m-my kids adored her.
she was the perfect grandmother.

66
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,100
how dare you come in here

67
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,500
and accuse her of being involved
in something like this?

68
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,000
no way.
my--my wife's right.

69
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,700
okay, this has gotta be
some kind of mistake.

70
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,600
perhaps it wasn't by choice.

71
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,600
someone may have
threatened her with violence

72
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,300
and forced her
into swallowing the drugs

73
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,400
with the intention
of retrieving them

74
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,600
once she returned
to the states.

75
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,800
if that's the case,

76
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,800
then we're lookin'
at a homicide.

77
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,400
you knew she was in mexico?

78
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,500
yeah, she--she went down with a group
from her retirement community.

79
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,800
what was the name of her
retirement community?

80
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
pacific shores.

81
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,500
(lindsay) nice.

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,400
how much do you think it costs
to stay in a place like this?

83
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,900
i don't know,
but stay close.

84
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,200
i don't want anybody
mistaking you

85
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,600
for a runaway resident.

86
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
hell, if i thought
my police pension would pay for this,

87
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,200
i'd retire here tomorrow.

88
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,300
well, it's about time.

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,700
i wasn't sure when
you were going to get here.

90
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,900
oh!

91
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,700
let me look at you.

92
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,400

93
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,000
but how many times
have i told you,

94
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,200
jeans are for cowboys?

95
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,900
why can't you wear a skirt?

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,700
you have beautiful legs.

97
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,600

98
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,000

102
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,600
i know it's hard.
but you'll find somebody else.

103
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,400
winnie,
this isn't your daughter.

104
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,300
jessica moved to boston,
remember?

105
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,100
she said she'd come visit.

106
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,400
i know. i'm--i'm sure
she's just been busy.

107
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,000
'll try calling her later,
okay? come on.

108
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,100

109
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,300
old girl has,
uh, alzheimer's.

harold larson.

111
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,800
we're looking for
administrator alan douglas.

112
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,600
down the hall.
i'll be happy to show you.

113
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,600
you, uh, married?

114
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,200
no.
boyfriend?

115
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,400
none of your business.

116
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,800
that's a no. too bad,
but, uh, not uncommon

117
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,700
among strong,
beautiful women.

118
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,400
most men find them
intimidating.

119
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,300
fortunately for you,
i do not.

120
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,200
so what do you say we hook up
for dinner tonight,

121
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,100
shall we say, uh, 8-ish?

122
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,700
let me get back to you
on that, harold.

123
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,900
we pride ourselves on keeping

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,700
our residents health
happy and safe.

125
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,100
well, edna james is none
of those things right now.

126
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,800
(jacobi)
why was she in mexico?

127
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,200
vacation. a former resident,
martin mccain,

128
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,000
left a sizeable bequest to us.

129
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,700
it was his wish that the money
be used to take resides

130
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
to a spa he frequented
in mexico.

131
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,900
?????
healing powers.

132
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,700
healing powers?
i know.

133
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,300
but the fact is,
a week in the sun and sand

134
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,300
does do miracles
for some of the residents.

135
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,000
and who goes with 'em

136
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,500
they're accompanied
by a nurse

137
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,000
and our social director
reece bentley.

138
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,700
all right.  to speak to everyone
that was on this last trip.

139
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,300
i'll get you a list of names.

140
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
all the residents are here,

141
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,700
and i think the nurse
is working as well today.

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,600
but our social director reece
di't show up.

143
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,200
she hasn't been in
since edna died.

144
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,600
i guess she's still grieving.

145
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,600
okay, what guys?

146
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,700
what?

147
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,300
who's asked you
if they could go out with me?

148
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,500
(chucks)
you really want to know?

149
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,600
no.

150
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
no, i'm just kidding.

151
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,100
i bet it was fong,
wasn'tt?

152
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,900
he's the one guy in the bullpen
that i've always caught staring at my ass.

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,400
well, then you should????

154
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,100
so i'm guessing reece shoots up with heroin

155
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,000
gets a little light-headed
and takes a header through the coffee table.

156
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,000
sounds about right,
she hit her head hard enough to kill her.

157
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,100
overdose?
i'll let you know
when i get her labs back.

158
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,900
found this in the bedroom.

159
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,600
looks like she brought back
more than a tan from mexico.

160
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,300
so reece escorts a bunch
of senior citizens to mexico.

161
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,000
when they're lounging by the pool
or tucked in their beds at night,

162
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,500
she makes a heroin buy.

163
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,400
back in the privacy of her room,
she packs the drugs in balloons

164
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,600
and... somehow connces one or two
of the old folks to swallow the drugs.

165
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,300
once they're back
at the retirement community,

166
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,900
she gives them
a little prune juice,

167
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,100
and after a day or two
of, uh, bedpan patrol,

168
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,700
retrieves her drugs.
i like it.

169
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,900
hey, somebody
get a samplef is.

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
it's probably what she used
to cut the drugs with.

171
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,300
(man) okay, got it, inspector.
(man) need an evidence bag?

172
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,900
you, uh, got a minute,
inspector?

173
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,900
yeah.

174
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,300
i was wondering if you wanted
to have coffee sometime.

175
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
who are you?

176
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,700
hollis.
i'm robbery-homicide.

177
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
you are noasking me out
er a dead body.

178
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,200
uh, just coffee.

179
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,900
it--your partner thought
it was okay.

180
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,600
get out of my crime scene.
go!

181
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,900
let's take a walk.

182
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,500
i don't want to walk.
yeah, you do.

183
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,100
you think this death is
connected to edna james?

184
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,200
it has to be, but don't
put that in print yet, okay?

185
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,100
i don't want to spook anybody
else that might not be involved.

186
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,800
got it. i'll dig around,
see what i can find out
about this mexican spa.

187
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,200
i'll get you a search warrant
for pacific shores

188
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,400
and comb through our parolees,

189
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,600
see if anyone knows anything
about this dg operation.

190
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,500
i'll know more once
i've done the autopsy.

191
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,000
i don't think
ree bentley worked alone,

192
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,000
so i'm gonna go back
to the retirement community.

193
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,500
do you really think that
somebody has been using

194
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,700
old people from a nursing home
as drug mules?

195
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,200
nothing surprises me anymore.

196
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,600
actually, strike that.

197
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,400
the detective that just asked
lindsay out over a corpse?

198
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,700
that surprised me.

199
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,500
so how have you been,
robert?

200
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,800
good.
you know, keepin' busy.

201
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,500
workin'?
oh yeah.

202
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,400
here and there.
it's, uh, i don't know.

203
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,900
it's odd jobs mostly.

204
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,700
i'm, uh, still doing my music.

205
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,900
i'm puttin' together
a demo tape.

206
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,000
are you in a program?

207
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,300
on and off.

208
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,000
i'm clean. i'm not holding,
jill. i swear to god.

209
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,300
relax, it's okay.

210
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,800
i had them bring you in
to ask you

211
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,900
if you've heard anything about old people
being used as drug mules.

212
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,300
old people? (chuckles)

213
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
no.

214
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,600
would you mind asking around?

215
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,900
sure.

216
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,300
i ran into your parents
a couple months back.

217
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
you ever talk to them?

218
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,800
not so much.

219
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,600
they ask about me?

220
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,300
i'm sure they'd love
to hear from you.

221
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,400
my boyfriend's an e.r. doctor
over at mission cross north--

222
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,500
boyfriend?

223
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,800
i, uh, i should have married you
when i had the chance.

224
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,300
he also works
at a free clinic twice a week.

225
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,500
he can help you get
back into a program.

226
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,200
thanks...

227
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,900
for everything.

228
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,000
where's lindsay?
sorry, couldn't tell ya.

229
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,100
uh, wait. hold up. i need
to ask you a question.

230
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
it's about my wedding.

231
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,600
you're asking the wrong girl.

232
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,100
no kidding.
look, i'm gonna invite ed,

233
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,700
since we worked together,
and, of course,

234
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,500
she is gonna bring claire.
she is his wife.

235
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,100
but we're not gonna invite you.

236
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,700
i didn't expect you would,
but thanks for making a point of telling me.

237
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,300
just--look,i am gonna invite jacobi
and most of the other guys from the bullpen,

238
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,800
but i feel a little weird...

239
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,900
inviting lindsay.

240
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,600
maybe there's hope
for you after all.

241
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,600
but i don't want her to feel
like i'm shutting her out.

242
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,000
but the...
the ex-wife/new wife,

243
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,900
???
it's just...

244
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,900
she'll understand if she doesn't get
an invitation, right?

245
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,600
i think she'll get through it.
okay.

246
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,700
i hope so. i mean, she
barely got through our wedding.

247
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,200
that really wasn't
her fault, was it?

248
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,300
i guess not. my family
can be a little... trying.

249
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,600
a little? your brother stuck his
bare ass in the wedding cake.

250
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,400
but in his defense,
it had been cut.

251
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
good-bye, tom.

252
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,700
reece has worked here
for over eight years,

253
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,200
and she's never shown any indication
of the things you're talking about.

254
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,700
do you have contact information
for her next of kin?

255
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,500
yes, but i know for a fact
that her parents are out of the country.

256
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,100
reece gave them a cruise to the greek isles
for their 40th wedding anniversary.

257
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,000
that's aexpensive gift.

258
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,300
no, i-i have a right
to be informed.

259
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,800
just try and calm down,

260
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
jessica, what is going on?

261
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,200
it's okay, mrs. spencer, we're
just doing a security check.

262
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,300
harold's telling everyone
you're looking for a bomb.

263
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,500
a bomb?
no, there is no bomb.

264
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,900
well, well, i knew you'd be
coming back to see me.

265
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,500
what the hell
is wrong with him?

266
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
up against the wall.

267
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,500
jeez, you could have at least
taken me out to dinner first.

268
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,800
what are these?

269
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,000
those are my love mints.

270
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,500
"for treatment
of erectile dysfunction"?

271
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,700
it's strictly recreational.
i don't need them.

272
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,000
really.

273
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,600
what about this?
is this recreational, too?

274
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,800
that's medicinal.
for my glaucoma.

275
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,500
did you brinyour dope
back from mexico, too?

276
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
were you a drug mule,
harold?

277
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,100
what are you talking about?

278
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,400
i got it here.

279
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,000
i have a prescription for it
from dr. poole.

280
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,500
dr. stephan poole--
he's the community physician.

281
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,200
ask somebody
if you don't believe me.

282
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,500
oh, i intend to.

283
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,200
as a matter of fact,
we're interviewing everyone
who went on this last trip to mexico

284
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,700
with edna james
and reece bentley,

285
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,400
and if i find out that you were involved
in smuggling drugs--

286
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,800
what?

287
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,500
nothing, i--a little...
tightness in my chest.

288
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,700
it'll go as...

289
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,800
harold?

290
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,300
harold?

291
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,400
damn it.
i need some help in here!

292
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,800
gotcha!

293
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,500
are you kidding me?

294
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,000
two people have died, harold,
and i am trying to find out why.

295
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,900
if i find out, will you
have dinner with me?

296
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,700
look, no one's copping
to any drug muling,

297
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,700
and the k-9 unit
didn find any heroin.

298
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,800
but we've got four more
residents holding pot,

299
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,000
all of whom have prescriptions
from this, uh, dr. poole.

300
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,500
now he didn't go
on this last trip to mexico,

301
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,700
but he's been
on previous ones.

302
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,500
my contact called to say
somebody new has been bringing in heroin--

303
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,400
not a lot,

304
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,000
but enough to piss off
the local suppliers.

305
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,200
he's still looking
for more information.

306
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,000
so what about this dr. poole?
dr. stephan poole--

307
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,500
his license was revoked
in 1999

308
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,200
because of
a substance abuse problem.

309
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,100
he hadt reinstated in 2003.

310
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
hey, hey, boxer,

311
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,400
how was your date?

312
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,500
that's it.

313
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,100
uh, listen up.

314
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,900
???
???

315
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,100
since everyone seems to be
so damn interested in my social life

316
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,400
yes, i went on a date.

317
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,400
uh, it was a onetime thing.

318
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,000
i am not officially
back on the market.

319
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,300
even if i was, i wouldn't
go out with any of you losers.

320
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,700
okay?

321
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,100
stop staring at my ass, fong.

322
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,700
so any other questions?

323
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,300
(tom) i have a question.

324
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,400
how come councilman ogilvie's
78-year-old mother

325
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,800
was strip-searched at her retirement home
this afternoon?

326
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
no one was strip-searched,

327
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,500
unless jacobi got a little
freaky behind my back.

328
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,300
he does have that
"golden girl" fetish.

329
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
this is funny to you?
huckles)

330
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,400
<i>it's a little funny.</i>

331
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,900
no?
no.

332
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,400
(clears throat) we had
the drug dogs go through

333
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,300
the retirement commuty
where reece bentley worked.

334
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,600
did they find anything?

335
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,700
well, several of
the old-timers had pot,

336
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,900
<i>including mrs. ogilvie.
you're kidding.</i>

337
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,900
but they claim to have
a prescription for it from their doctor,
who, strangely enough,

338
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,000
had a drug problem.
he's in
the interrogation room.

339
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,000
jacobi and i
are about to go break him.

340
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,400
any other estions?
good.

341
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,700
do not encourage her.

342
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,400
why was
your license suspended?

343
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,400
i developed an addiction
to painkilrs

344
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,000
following a cycling accident.

345
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,300
but i entered a diversion program.
i've been clean  for four years.

346
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,900
look, i'm still subjected
to weekly random drug tests.
it's on record.

347
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,700
why are you asking me this?

348
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
you prescribe marijuana ????

349
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,000
if there's a medicinal need.
come on. medicinal?

350
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,500
yes, depending on--
and were the drugs found in
edna james' stomach medicinal?

351
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,400
what drugs? i wasn't
prescribing anything for edna.

352
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,900
what was your relationship???

353
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,500
i didn't have one.
were you giving her drugs, too?

354
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,300
no, wait. stop, stop.
slow down.

355
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,200
i a suspect?
at least we're all on the same page.

356
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,100
well, i'm guessing this is the part
where i demand to see a lawyer.

357
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,300
good guess.

358
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,700
(knock on door)claire just called,
said she's got a problem in the morgue.

359
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,500
what kind of problem?

360
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,800
edna james had high levels
of loperamide hydrochloride in her system.

361
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,600
is that some sort
of poison?

362
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,900
it's an over-the-counter ???

363
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,100
probably to keep them  from passing the drugs
until after they got home.

364
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,600
reece shows no indications of drug use--
no track marks,

365
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,100
no needle popping signs
anywhere on her body.

366
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,500
she was a good girl.

367
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,800
she exercised regularly,
ate a macriotic diet,

368
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,500
used her sunscreen,
got her first tattoo recently.

369
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,600
nothing big--just a little
butterfly on her hip,

370
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,900
the kind of thing
no one would know about
if she didn't want 'em to.

371
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,700
she waited until she was
in her 30s to ink her body.

372
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,500
not some rash act
of a rebellious teenager.

373
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,400
so she was either
forced to shoot up,

374
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,600
or someone put her head
through a coffee table

375
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,100
and then gave her a hot shot
to make it look like a drug overdose.

376
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,800
i'm afraid
it's worse than that.

377
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,700
the heroine found in reece bentley is the same
as the stuff in edna james' belly,

378
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,700
and i've got
three more o.d.s--

379
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,700
this one

380
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,100
and two others in the fridge.

381
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,500
the heroin has all been cut
with methylfentanyl,

382
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,900
a powerful analgesic
5,000 times stronger than morphine,

383
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,800
making it lethal.

384
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,300
sorry.
i got here as soon as i could.

385
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,200
my editor's holding space
on the front page.

386
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,200
i gure the sooner we get word out on
the street about e bad heroin,

387
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,000
the sooner we can stop
these bodies from piling up.

388
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,400
oh, god.

389
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,100
(lindsay) do you know him?

390
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,800
yeah, i went to law school with him.
his name is robert danies.

391
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,300
i called him in today

392
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,400
to see if he could find anything out
about niors being used as drug mules.

393
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,300
(lindsay) so he was
your street contact?

394
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,800
he had this in his pocket.

395
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,500
what's "vega"?
i don't know.

396
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
we're still trying to track down
his next of kin.

397
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,400
i know his parents.
i'll call them.

398
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,600
?????

399
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,000
???

400
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,100
excuse me???

401
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,400
???

402
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,900
uh...just???

403
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,000
my..??

404
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,300
i know this is ...
??

405
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,500
is..???

406
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,000
that entered your
mother-in-law's life recently--

407
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,100
someone new she was seeing
or she was talking about?

408
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,600
no, i mean, her life
revolved around her friends

409
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,300
at the retirement community,
so...

410
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,800
um, we did get into a bit of
an argument recently, though.

411
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,300
she, uh, yeah, she wanted
to change her will

412
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,600
to leave part of her estate
to one of the nurses.

413
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,900
and when edna put her mind
to something...

414
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,000
let's just say noni and i
would have never gotten married

415
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,700
if we hadn't eloped.
what was this nurse's name?

416
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,900
uh, logan. logan young.

417
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
if you ask me, i thi
she had a crush on him.

418
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,100
thank you.

419
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
thank you.

420
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,300
what are you doing?

421
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,300
i went out with the boys

422
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,500
to shake down
a uple of informants

423
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,800
for old time's sake.

424
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,300
i knew a midlevel drug dealer
named vega

425
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,900
when i was working
gang task force.

426
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,900
i thought
it might be something,

427
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
but seems nobody knows
where he is.

428
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,100
you can't be doing that.
you're the lieutenant.

429
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
you worried about me?

430
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,500
you see this?

431
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,600
yeah. at least word's
getting out there.

432
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,200
okay, i'm coordinating
with narcotics and the d.e.a.

433
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,100
this is not your typical
black tar chiva.

434
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,500
somebody cut it
with methylfentanyl

435
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,900
before they even
brought it in.
so they messed up?

436
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,400
or it was done on purpose.

437
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,000
jill's contact said there was
a new small-time importer

438
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,800
that was pissing off
the locals.
what about the doctor suspect?

439
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,500
well, so far he checks out,
but we're still digging.

440
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,900
i'll let you know.
all right. um...

441
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,500
(lowers voice)
i need you to take care

442
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,900
of one more thing for me.

443
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,300
yeah, what's that?

444
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,700
undercover guys arrested her
for trying to make a buy.

445
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,900
i swear to you
i was not buying drugs.

446
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,200
i was inquiring about them.

447
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,900
i was trying to find out what
i could about this drug muling.

448
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,200
next thing you know, this guy
is slapping cuffs on me.
that sounds kinky.

449
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,700
how are you doing?
i talked to robert danies' parents.

450
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,700
his mother's on her way down
to claim his effects.

451
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,800
(lindsay) well, tom knew

452
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,600
of a midlevel drug dealer
nad vega.

453
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,500
we're running his name
through the database

454
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,400
and trying tracking him down.

455
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,300
i shouldn't have
asked him to help.

456
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,100
you are not responsible for this.
no?

457
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,200
no.

458
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,600
reece bentley
was squeaky-clean.

459
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,100
i think she was murdered
and set up.

460
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,400
well, her financial records
and lifestyle

461
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,100
show no signs of additional
drug money income.
what about her parents' cruise?

462
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,600
looks likehe was saving
for that for months.

463
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,200
well, the mexican spa???

464
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,700
it's a nice place.

465
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,400
there's maybe a bit of hype

466
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,700
about the healing powers
of theatural springs,

467
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,400
but there's
nothing questionable.

468
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,800
the powder i found in reece's
carpet was vermiculite--

469
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,900
it's a mineral often used
in insulation or fireproofing.

470
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,500
there were no other
sources in her place.
so it could have come off???

471
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,900
which lends credence
to the theory

472
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,800
that she was murdered,
and she probably knew her killer

473
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,400
because i doubt that dog of hers
would have let a stranger in,

474
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,100
which probably leads us back

475
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,500
to the pacific shores
retirement community.

476
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,800
on a whim, i pulled
the financial records

477
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,000
on the residents
from the home

478
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,600
who passed away
over the last few years.

479
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,900
several of them left
portions of their estate

480
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,100
to a nurse--
a guy named logan young.

481
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,200
wait. dennis iverson said
that edna was trying

482
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,500
to change her will
to include logan young.

483
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,100
ladies, we may have a winner.

484
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,900
(lindsay) you're very popular
with the residents

485
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,300
of the pacific shores
retirement community,

486
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,000
aren't you, mr. logan?

487
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,300
so popular, in fact,
that several of the residents

488
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,600
have put you in their wills.

489
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,600
i spd more time with them
than their families do.

490
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,600
well, isn't that your job?
as a nurse, yes.

491
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,400
but i became their friend,
a confidant.

492
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,600
if it made them feel good
to remember me in their wills,

493
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,600
who am i to refuse?

494
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,600
so was that the scam--
you befriend these old people,

495
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
gain their trust, get them
to put you in their wills,

496
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,200
and--and then what,
they weren't dying fast enough,

497
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,000
so you decided to put them
to work as drug les?

498
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,000
you crazy, all right?
i like my job.

499
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,500
i like the people
i take care of.
then why is edna james ???

500
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,400
from a toxic drug overdose?
his car is clean

501
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,500
you searched my car?
it's parked on police property.

502
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,400
we are getting a subpoena
to search your house.

503
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,400
all right, you don't need
a search warrant, all right?

504
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,800
go ahead. knock yourself out.
i got nothing to hide.

505
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,500
you also got a phone call
from your boyfriend harold.

506
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
says he needs to talk to you.

507
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,700
that's who you should be
talkin' to if you want to know

508
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,600
what's going on
at pacific shores--

509
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,200
especially with edna, since
harold was sleeping with her.
shut up.

510
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,200
he was--her, winnie
and several others.

511
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,500
there's more bed-hopping going
on in a rerement community

512
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,400
than a swinger's club.
trust me.

513
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,000
i've walked in on things
no man should ever see.
it must be his love mints.

514
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,200
he is half past 100,
and edna was a sweet old lady.

515
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,700
they're old, not dead.

516
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,100
bet she was having
more sex than you are.

517
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,200
(claire) is this your son
robert, mrs. danies?

518
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,200
i tried to get my husband
to come, but...

519
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,400
i think robert died
a long time ago for him.

520
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,000
oh, oh...

521
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,100
this is when he was 8.
he was a handful.

522
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,000
i wish he was that age again,
and i could start over.

523
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,200
does the name vega mean
anything to you, mrs. danies?

524
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,800
no.

525
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,000
i used to pretend
i hadn't heard from him

526
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,900
because he had met someone,
and he ran off to europe,

527
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,800
where he was living happily
as a musician.

528
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,700
that's what he'd--
he'd always wanted to be.

529
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,200
there was a tape of his music
with his personal effects.

530
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,400
please. i know he'd
want you to have that.

531
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,100
the son that
i want to remember

532
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,400
is still
running around the yard

533
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,400
chasing the dog with a hose.

534
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,900
you look like
you could use some chocolate.

535
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,500
there's something so wrong

536
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,000
with a parent
outliving their child.

537
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,100
i can't imagine getting your kid
all the way to college--

538
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,000
you think they've survived

539
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,300
all the trials
and tribulations of childhood...

540
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,600
running into traffic,
drowning in the pool,

541
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,000
somebody snatchin' 'em
at the grocery store and...

542
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,700
and then losing 'em.

543
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,400
yeah, i don't think
i want to have children,

544
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,600
because i couldn't take
if anything happened to them.

545
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,000
is that why you're dragging
yo heels with luke?

546
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,500
he's made it very clear
he wants to move forward.

547
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,300
people have a habit of
disappearing out of my life.

548
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,900
me and lindsay are still here.
for how long?

549
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,800
you know, i thought
lindsay and tom

550
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,500
would be together forever.

551
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,700
well, sometimes life gets you
on the blind side.

552
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,000
i never planned
on ed getting shot

553
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,100
and winding up in a wheelchair,
but it happened.

554
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,600
life goes on,
and you make the best of it

555
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,100
because it's
the only one you get.

556
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,700
if you're strong and push
through the pain and the fear,

557
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,400
you often find that happiness
is waiting for you

558
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,500
on the other side.

559
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,900
and if you're
not strong enough?

560
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,200
then that is what
your friends are for--

561
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,400
to give you a gentle push

562
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,400
or a kick in the ass.

563
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,600
the more we come here, the more
i realize i miss my mom.

564
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,100
i have the opposite problem.
i can't get rid of mine.

565
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,600
she'll probably
outlive us both.
jessica!

566
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,900
oh, here we go.

567
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:22,400
you should have called me.
i-i look like a mess.

568
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,800
no, you look fine.

569
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,000
uh, do you know
where harold is?

570
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,300
he's watching tv.

571
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,600
arclonna
introduce me to your friend?

572
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,300
right. um, do you remember
you met the other day?

573
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,700
this is inspector jacobi,

574
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,700
and i'm
inspector lindsay boxer.

575
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,600
how do you do?
always a pleasure, ma'am.

576
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,900
winnie, do you know
what happened to edna?

577
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
i'm afraid she passed away.

578
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,200
yes, from a drug overdose.

579
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,000
someone was using her to smuggle
heroin back from mexico.

580
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,200
do you know anything
about that?

581
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,100
there are a lot of bad things
ing on around here.

582
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,300
(lowers voice) like what kind
of bad things?

583
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,600
well, i'm pretty sure...

584
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,700
someone is taking pictures
of me when i'm bathing...

585
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,400
you know, like for those
girlie calendars.

586
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,200
i have alerted
administrator douglas,

587
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,300
but i don't think
he believes me.

588
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,600
but perhaps you could
speak to him for me?

589
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,500
(normal voice) yes, uh,
we will look into that.

590
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,100
thank you.

591
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,900
well, that was helpful.

592
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,100
(lindsay) can we talk to you
for a minute, mr. larson?

593
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,100
harold?

594
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,500
nice try, harold.

595
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,100
oh, god, i think he really
is dead this time.

596
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,500
hey. what happened?

597
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,900
i don't know.
the guy looked dead.

598
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,600
maybe somebody gave him
a shot of bad heroin.

599
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,900
why?

600
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,100
he was snooping around.

601
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,500
he called me earlier and said
he needed to talk to me.
where's jacobi?

602
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,400
back at the retirement center

603
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,600
questioning all the residents
and staff.

604
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,300
i'm gonna go over there later.
your friend was lucky
you found him when you did.

605
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,000
he's not dying,
but he sure came close. hello.

606
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,100
hi.

607
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,500
was it heroin?

608
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,000
no. uh, no.
he's extremely hypoglycemic.

609
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,100
he was about ten minutes away
from slipping into a coma,

610
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,600
which is strange considering
he's not diabetic.
could someone have ???

611
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,100
yeah, i guess,
if they really wanted to.

612
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,600
an insulin overdose
would do it.

613
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,800
it's almost impossible to
pick up in an autopsy, too.

614
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,900
listen, i've gotta get back
to a chronic c.o.p.d.'er.

615
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,900
wait, i'm gonna have a uni
babysit harold tonight, okay?

616
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,800
i don't want anybody
gettin' near him.
yes, ma'am.

617
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,200
y'all could pretend to be

618
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,300
a little less in love
for my sake.
i'm trying. what now?

619
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,500
now we find the person who tried
to give harold a dirt nap.

620
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,700
is there some next of kin
we should be notifying?

621
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,100
apparently not. the guy
doesn't have anybody.

622
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,400
you know,
i don't want to get old.

623
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,000
i just--i don't think
it's a good idea.

624
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,100
you know,
things stop working,

625
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,600
and people have to take care
of you. just--no.

626
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,900
isn't that what kids are for?

627
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,700
you know, you birth
your own caregivers

628
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,000
for your twilight years?
wow, that is some maternal
instinct you have there.

629
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,000
the truth is,
you can't count on family.
or spouses.

630
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,800
women outlive men long after
they've outgrown them.

631
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,600
we'll probably end up
in a condo in boca raton.

632
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,500
i see lots of floppy hats
and big sunglasses

633
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,400
and acrylic nails
in our future.

634
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,500
think you need to go home.

635
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,700
you're getting delirious.

636
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,800
no, i'm gonna wait
till the uni gets here.

637
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,800
i'll see you in the morning.

638
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,800
and i don't want excuses
or explanations or anything.

639
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:52,000
i want you to make sure that
it doesn't happen again, ever.

640
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,500
now label it and make a note
that it was on the floor

641
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
and is most likely contaminated.

642
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,500
i can come back.

643
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:01,900
no.

644
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,900
just had a bit
of a conniptiofit.

645
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,200
do those hurt?

646
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
sorry.

647
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,500
i came in here
to do some work,

648
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,200
and there's evidence
on the floor.

649
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,200
no one seems to notice or care.

650
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,000
they just drop it
and leave it there

651
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,800
like it's peanut shells
at a ball game!

652
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,000
i didn't even notice

653
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,500
until i felt
the crunch under my shoe.

654
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,500
ew. was it a finger?

655
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,900
well, i don't know.

656
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,100
no, it was the vermiculite

657
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,700
from reece bentley's
crime scene.

658
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,900
oh, the insulation?

659
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,900
yeah, insulation,

660
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,200
packing material,
soil additive--

661
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,300
they even use it to make
inground pools.

662
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,300
wait. what?

663
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,200
inground pools. they use it to
make sure the bottom's smooth.

664
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,500
no, no, no, the other part.
the soil?
yeah.

665
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,200
oh, i think you might owe
your tech an apology.

666
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,700
i don't think
that was spilled.

667
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,500
what if it came off of
someone's shoes or their clothes

668
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,400
like it did
at reece bentley's apartment?

669
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,500
dennis iverson, edna's
son-in-law, was here yesterday

670
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
picking up his mother-in-law's
things, right?
yeah.

671
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,400
do you know what he does
for a living? landscaping.

672
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,600
(cell phone rings)
i saw his truck at his house.

673
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,800
boxer. jacobi, li--

674
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,300
okay, great, i'll be there
in a second.

675
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,800
listen, i need you to get
dennis iverson in custody now.

676
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,200
we have evidence that he was
at reece bentley's apartment.

677
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,100
okay, thanks.
harold's woken up.

678
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,600
maybe he has something for me...
other than an erection.

679
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,000
(lindsay) why would someone
try to kill you, harold?

680
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,400
maybe i was getting
a little too nosy.

681
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,300
i was playing detective.

682
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,500
did you know that edna
was beginning to get nervous

683
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,800
she might not be able
to stay on at the home?

684
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,900
her money had run out.
what about her daughter?

685
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
she was nice, but she
didn't have any doug-

686
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,300
probably because
of her husband dennis--

687
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,400
a real creep.

688
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,400
he shows up at pacific shores
at least once a week

689
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,800
doing e landscaping,
but he never once

690
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,600
popped in
to say hello to edna,

691
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,300
unless it s to ask
for more money.

692
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,300
money for what?
well, maybe his business
was in trouble.

693
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,700
edna had a nice little nest egg
when she first came here,

694
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,600
but now it was gone,

695
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,800
and they were threatening
to kick her out.

696
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,400
what--dennis?

697
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,600
no, the administrator--
alan douglas.

698
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,900
i was snoopin' around his office
looking for clues,

699
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,100
and he was not amused.

700
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,400
well, did you find anything?

701
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,700
no drugs, but a lot of porno.

702
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,700
seems douglas really likes
large women.

703
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,000
i mean, some of these broads

704
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,500
could have played
for the broncos.

705
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,400
harold, focus.

706
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,100
did alan douglas threaten
anyone else at pacific shores?

707
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,900
two or three of the residents
were in financial trouble.

708
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,300
some of them signed their
estates over to pacific shores

709
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,600
in exchange for staying on
at the home.

710
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,500
now the dough was gone
all of a sudden,

711
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
and they were worried they
were gonna be kicked out.

712
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,700
these people, did they
all go to mexico?

713
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,100
harold is right.

714
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,800
dennis iverson's landscape
company was in trouble.

715
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,700
yeah, so much so
that he was paying ex-cons

716
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,100
under the table
to work for him.

717
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,500
and at least one of them
has a drug record.

718
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,900
okay. can you get me warrants
for iverson's house,

719
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,600
his trucks, his warehouse?
already in the works.

720
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,100
i also opened up pacific shores'
financial records.

721
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,100
i'm gonna need
a forensic accountant

722
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,400
to dig through it all,
but it looks like

723
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,300
somebody was making
some very bad investments.

724
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,700
but dennis wouldn't have
had access to that.
no, but somebody ???

725
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,500
somebody like administrator
alan douglas.

726
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,600
he was investing money he was
supposed to be holding in trust

727
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,800
for the residents and keeping
the profits for himself--

728
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,500
until the market crashed.
did you know that
he used to be a nurse?

729
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,200
guess where
he went to school?

730
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,600
university of
huatulco, mexico, baby.

731
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,900
so alan douglas
needed to reple

732
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,500
the money he lost investing.

733
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,300
why not drug smuggling?
he had the mexican connection,

734
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,900
nursing know-how,
an adequate supply of mules.

735
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,400
but he couldn't do it
on his own,

736
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,600
and he knew dennis iverson
s desperate

737
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,500
to keep his mother-in-law
in pacific shores,

738
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,500
and dennis had cons
working for him.

739
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,100
oh, this is good.
you're good.

740
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,100
<i>we're good. we set?</i>

741
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,800
yeah.
excuse us.

742
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,100
i called him at work
and told him

743
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,100
we had some information
on his mother-in-law's death.

744
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,600
how long has he been in there?
about 20 minutes.

745
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,900
good. he should be
just gettin' squirmy by now.

746
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,100
and hot. i turned the heat up
in there before he got here.

747
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,100
you are evil.
mm.

748
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,300
this is why i love you.
(chuckles)

749
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,800
what about the wife?
should be here any minute.

750
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,600
okay, i'm gonna soften him u
a bit before she gets here.

751
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,600
do you still have the heroin
from reece bentley's house?

752
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,500
i'm gonna tell him that we found
his fingerprints on the drugs.

753
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,400
ooh! who's evil now?

754
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,400
i was beginning to think
you guys forgot about me.

755
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,400
it's kinda hot in here.
really? 'cause it doesn't
feel hot to me.

756
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,300
mnh-mnh.

757
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,600
so what's going on?
did you guys find something?

758
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,800
what's that?
well, you tell us.

759
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,200
your fingerprints
are all over it.

760
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,600
what? i-i don't even know
what that is.

761
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,800
you're barely making ends meet.
your business is crashing.

762
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,000
you couldn't even afford
to keep your wife's mother

763
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,500
in a retirement community.

764
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:22,200
so you came up with a plan to
make the old girl a drug mule.
you're crazy.

765
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,100
you took 30 or so
down to mexico for a trip.

766
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,100
you picked, i don't know,
two or three

767
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,500
and fed them
a dozen balloons of heroin.

768
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,700
then you gave them
antidiarrhea medicine

769
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,500
so they couldn't unload
the drugs until they

770
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,600
smuggled them all the way back
to the retirement community,

771
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,700
where you then pump them
full of laxatives.
i haven't been mexico

772
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,500
do you know what vermiculite is?
yeah, we--we use it
to treat the soil. why?

773
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,300
because it was found
in the morgue after you came in

774
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,100
to claim edna's
personal effects.

775
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,500
so maybe i had some
on my boots, you know?

776
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,000
what's that got to do
with anything?
we found some

777
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:59,500
must have come off your boots
when you killed her.
i-i didn't kill anyone.

778
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,600
you used senior citizens
as drug mules?
(door closes)

779
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,400
(scoffs) it was a great plan
until edna died on the plane.

780
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,500
you knew there would be
an autopsy.

781
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,700
you knew we would
find the drugs,

782
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,000
so you needed a scapegoat--
reece bentley.

783
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,500
she was on the trip,
she lived by herself,

784
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,200
so you killed her,
covered it up

785
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,000
to make it look
like a drug overdose.
you know what?

786
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,100
i've heard enough of this,
so i'm leaving.

787
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,000
we have search warrants
for your house, your car,

788
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,200
your business.
no, we are leaving.

789
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,900
is it true, dennis?
honey, don't listen to them.

790
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,000
they--they don't know what
the hell they're talking about.

791
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,500
did you kill my mother?

792
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,900
of course not.

793
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,100
the district attorney's office

794
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,200
is willing to cut you a deal
right now if you cooperate.

795
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,000
you could be looking
at life behind bars.
oh, my god.

796
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,500
no, honey, don't listen to them,
all right? they're bluffing.

797
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,000
we've already arrested
two of your ex-con workers,

798
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,000
including a drug dealer
named vega.

799
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,900
we're giving you the chance
to roll on them

800
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,000
before they roll on you--

801
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,300
unless you want to be
bunk buddies in san quentin.
dennis!

802
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,400
just shut up, all right?
just... shut up.

803
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,900
do you have any idea how much
it cost to keep your mother

804
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,500
in that damn place?
so you killed her?

805
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,500
no! no. this whole thing
wasn't even my idea. okay?

806
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,100
it was alan douglas.

807
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,900
no one was supposed
get hurt.

808
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,000
look, the old folks
went along with it if it meant

809
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,900
thathey got to stay
in the retirement community.

810
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,000
he threatened to put 'em
on the street

811
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,100
if they didn't go alg with it.
so what happened
to reece bentley?

812
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,400
he said that
she knew something,

813
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,300
and he wanted to scare her
into not talking.

814
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,600
but she didn't know anything.

815
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,300
he lied to me to get me
to go with him.

816
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,700
alan douglas killed her...

817
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,100
to cover his tracks.

818
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,200
mr. douglas?

819
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,900
excuse me, mr. douglas,

820
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,900
we have a warrant
for your arrest.

821
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,800
gun!
(woman screams)

822
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,000
ohh!

823
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,500
(jacobi) stop!

824
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,500

825
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,100

826
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,900
oh!

827
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,600
come here.

828
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,500
no, no, no, no, no, no!
(screams)

829
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,200
back off...
or i'll shoot her!
(gasping)

830
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,700
winnie, just relax, all right?
he is not gonna shoot you.

831
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,200
i will if you don't
put down the guns.

832
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,000
i mean it!

833
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
you are not gonna shoot her
or anybody else today.

834
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,700
you see?

835
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,800
i was counting.

836
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,400
i do this for a living.

837
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,200
and i gotta tell ya,
i hate amateurs.

838
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,900
are you all right?

839
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,300
you handcuffed him
underwater?

840
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,800
that's very impressive,
houdini.

841
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,200
don't you sweet-talk me.
you could've tackled him.

842
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,500
hey, i just got this suit.

843
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:14,800
get out.

844
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
so dennis and douglas
both needed money.

845
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,000
one of them had
a mexican connection

846
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,400
and a supply of potential mules,

847
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,800
and the other had a network of
ex-cons with drug backgrounds.

848
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,400
that's a match made
in heaven.

849
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,200
something tells me that's not
where they're gonna end up.

850
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,600
let's hope not.

851
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,000
here's to putting
a few more bad guys away.

852
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,500
