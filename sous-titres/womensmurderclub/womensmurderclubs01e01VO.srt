3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,200
okay, here's the thing-- I'll give you the dollar.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,600
I just need a quarter.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,000
Buy something.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,000
24 cents is your change.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,100
Have a nice day.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,800
 you have one saved message.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,900
 To hear your saved messages, press 7. 

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,300
Wait! Wait, I got it.

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,400
 lindsay, it's theresa woo.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,800
 I was hoping you could meet me.

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,700
 3rd street newsstand, 8:00 A.M.

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,100
 I know we're not exactly friends, but it's important.

15
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,200
 Thanks, lindsay.

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,400
 See you in the morning.

17
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,100
I'm here. Where are you?

18
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,000
(Man chuckles) at the moment,in my kitchen, making coffee.

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,600
Tom.

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,900
You still recognize my voice.

21
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,100
We were married... once.

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,899
Lindsay?

23
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,400
Linz, are you okay? Lindsay!

24
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,200
Linz, are you okay?

25
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,500
Theresa woo just...

26
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,000
fell on my car.

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:19,300


28
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,100
I wanna know if the blood spatter is impact or cast-off.

29
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,600
Shoe prints--get 'em before the wind does.

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,600
(Man) you got it, detective.

31
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,500
Welcome to our day off.

32
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Yeah, like you'd know what to do with a few free hours.

33
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,000
For your information,I had plans.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,800
I was gonna go for a runand I was gonna clean my apartment.

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,900
Shut uP.

36
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,600
So instead you decided to meet up with a reporter,

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
and look where it got you.

38
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,600
Look where it got her.

39
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,600
Will, tell dispatch medical examiner wants a tow truck.

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,900
Gonna have to haul in the whole kit and caboodle.

41
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,900
Hi, sammy.

42
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,400
Deputy D.A. Bernhardt.

43
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,700
Is it really theresa woo?

44
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,900
A sad day for san francisco.

45
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,600
Inspector boxer said you might need this.

46
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,700
Yeah. Ah.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,300
Thanks.

48
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,900
You're not gonna be at a loss for suspects.

49
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,400
Theresa woo, god bless her, bashed or exposed half of san francisco

50
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,700
for sex or corruption or...sexual corruption.

51
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,900
She's won,

52
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,900
what, six pulitzers for the "register"in the past ten years?

53
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,000
So wait a minute, you were standing there on the street

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,400
and... crash?

55
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,700
Uh, I was, at that exact moment,

56
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,500
talking to tom. He called.

57
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,700
Tom called?

58
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,300
What did he say?

59
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,100
Have you called him back?

60
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,700
Theresa woo...

61
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,500
fell...

62
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,700


63
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,600
But why would tom call you?

64
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,700
Our 2-year divorce anniversary is sunday.

65
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,100
Maybe it was a nostalgia thing.

66
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,200
And maybe he misses you.

67
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,600
What I'm trying to figure out is,

68
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,000
theresa's message said to meet her in front of the newsstand.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,500
So why was she on the roof?

70
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,700
To make sure she wasn't followed?

71
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,700
She was super secretive.

72
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,000
So the question is,

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,900
who was making theresa so afraid

74
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,200
that she was desperate enough to call me?

75
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,100
Obvious place to start is with the subjects of her exposes.

76
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,600
If anyone was mad enough to take her to court,

77
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,800
maybe they were mad enough to kill her.

78
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,400
I'll find out if there's any pending litigation.

79
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,500
I'll get her back to the morgue.

80
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Hopefully, she managed to pick up some D.N.A. Evidence in the back and forth.

81
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,800
I'll grab jacobi,

82
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,300
see if anything turns up at her apartment.

83
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,300
And you're gonna call tom back.

84
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,400
Yeah, totally.

85
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,600
(Man) theresa woo's address book is a dead end.

86
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,400
Well, you got anything?

87
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,800
no.

88
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,700
Uh, some receipts, paid bills,

89
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,200
mostly dog related

90
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,400
you know, I'm starting to get why theresa called me.

91
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,800
She didn't have anyone else.

92
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,700
The woman was obsessed with her job.

93
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,800
The address book doesn't even have an "in case of an emergency" contact.

94
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,300
At least you have a couple of human friends.

95
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,400
I'm not going to miss you, you know?

96
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,900
When you get your promotion,

97
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,400
and I get A...

98
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,500
shiny, new partner...

99
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,500
young, handsome...

100
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,700
two good knees.

101
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,900
If I get the lieutenant spot,

102
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,700
I'll make sure you get plenty of me from behind my shiny,

103
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,300
new boss-man desk.

104
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,300
You know what there isn't any sign of? A computer.

105
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,400
Theresa was old-school,

106
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,500
everything by hand,

107
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,000
always carryinaround those ratty old notebooks.

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,400
Yeah, well, where are they?

109
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,300
She didn't bring 'em to the meeting.

110
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,600
They could be back at her office.

111
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,500
Well, let's hit the road.

112
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,300
I got years of newspaper exposes to weed through.

113
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,800
What?

114
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,600
Oh, hell no.

115
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,800
But look, she likes you.

116
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
I said call the dog pound.

117
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,400
It's just a little stroll.

118
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,700
I can't take her into the morgue.

119
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,300
What if she eats some evidence?

120
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,000
Come on, jill.

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,900
It's just a key.

122
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,400
It's moving in.

123
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,400
Whole can of worms.

124
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,100
Can't we just... be in love 

125
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,100
and happy and have lots of sex?

126
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,600
Ooh, we can do that, too.

127
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,400
Didn't we decide you weren't gonna come by my office?

128
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,000
You know what?

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,200
I just signed the lease,landlord gave me two sets of keys,

130
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,800
and I'm off for a 24-hour shift at the hospital,

131
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,700
so I broke the rules.

132
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,100
Giving my boss further ammunition for hating me,

133
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,300
should she decide to drop in.

134
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,500
Yeah. Oh, she'd hate it if she were to see us,

135
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,300
you know, like this.

136
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,400
Definitely not like this.

137
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,500
Yeah, definitely.

138
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,900
hey, claire's got--whoops.

139
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,700
Oh, hey, linz.

140
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,200
Hi.

141
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,600
So...

142
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,400
I am going to leave this...

143
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,900
right here. Okay?

144
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,000
No pressure.

145
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,200
But come on, move in with me.

146
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
See ya.

147
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,800
Guess who's moving in with a boy?

148
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,600
 Considering moving in.

149
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,800
We're...

150
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,300
god.

151
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,700
Well, given your usual terrible taste in men,

152
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,000
this is good news.

153
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,700
I actually don't hate luke.

154
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,900
what do you know?

155
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,600
Time of death-- no mystery there.

156
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,200
Cause...

157
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,000
if the fall hadn't gotten her,

158
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,200
the gunshots would've.

159
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Three of 'em,all to the torso.

160
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,300
What about D.N.A.?

161
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,100
Not looking promising.

162
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,400
I just came from her apartment.

163
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,800
It screams "lonely workaholic."

164
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,700
Speaking of,did you call tom back?

165
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,400
I'll give you workaholic.

166
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,900
Lonely?

167
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,700
Don't think so.

168
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,500
Yeah. Inappropriate.

169
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Yikes.

170
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,900
Well, not your mama's bikini wax.

171
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,600
Maintenance like that, she was definitely sleeping with somebody.

172
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,100
Well, there was no man stuff at her apartment.

173
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,700
No extra toothbrush,only one towel on the rack.

174
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,500
So whoever she was seeing,it must've been new.

175
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,200
Or secret.

176
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,300
(Man) men? No.

177
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,300
No men, no friends, just work.

178
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,200
And I have no idea what she was working on,

179
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,200
never had any idea until she was ready to publish.

180
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,600
But I guarantee you, it was incendiary and honest.

181
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,800
see? That's how much theresa trusted me.

182
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,000
Now I gotta call a damn locksmith.

183
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,900
Don't you need a warrant for that?

184
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,900
Cindy thomas, metro desk.

185
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,100
There's nothing in there,anyway.

186
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,100
And you know that how?

187
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,100
Common kwledge. Theresa never left anything in the office.

188
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,900
Plus, I picked it already.

189
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,600
It's empty.

190
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,200
you were a friend?

191
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,400
Yeah. No. No, a colleague,

192
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,600
I-I-I guess.

193
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,900
Um... well, admirer, mostly.

194
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,400
Theresa was sort of a mentor...

195
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,700
from afar.

196
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,600
We didn't really talk, actually.

197
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,300
She did say "nice work" to me once.

198
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,500
Do you know who did this to her?

199
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,000
Do you know anything about her personal life?

200
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,600
She had one?

201
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,300
Oh, okay. Uh, boss.

202
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,900
I got... I gotta go.

203
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,400
I'm gonna have some people come over and go through theresa's computer.

204
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,500
Well, they won't find anything.

205
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,800
It's all in her notebooks.

206
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,700
Do you know where they are?

207
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,600
No, but listen,

208
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,500
if by some miracle you find them, I see them first.

209
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,600
Technically, they're the property of the "san francisco register."

210
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,700
Technically, they're evidence in a murder investigation.

211
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,000
Thank you.

212
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,500
okay, theresa, those notebooks are in here somewhere.

213
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,700
freeze. Police.

214
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,400
Hi... again.

215
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,800
Put the bag down.

216
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,700
I was gonna give them to you.

217
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,400
I just wanted to read them--read them first.
 Now.

218
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,200
really?

219
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,099
Hey, you don't have to do that.

220
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,700
you don't have to break and enter.

221
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,700
I didn'T.

222
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,300
Seriously, I told the super that I was theresa's sister...

223
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,700
the adopted sister.

224
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,900
Where were they?

225
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,700
Uh, sweater drawer.I checked that this morng.

226
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,000
No, there's a false bottom.

227
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,600
Pretty intricate one.

228
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,200
She must've had it specially made.

229
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,200
And don't feel bad. You would've found it eventually.

230
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,600
Gee, thanks.

231
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,400
Now tell me why I shouldn't arrest you for murder.

232
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,800
Um, because that's crazy.

233
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,100
Theresa was, like, my idol.

234
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,700
Maybe you were angry at her because she didn't pay as much attention to you as you wanted.

235
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,000
Maybe you were here to steal her story.

236
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's what you're doing now,right?

237
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,500
Whatever theresa was researching, she died for it.

238
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,600
If the story dies with her...

239
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,500
I can't let that happen.

240
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,400
And I have an alibi.

241
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,200
A whole handful of people saw me at the "register" this morning.

242
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,100
It's, uh, in shorthand,

243
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,200
some kind of code.

244
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,800
Mm, theresa was really paranoid.

245
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,500
Yeah, is it paranoia if you're right?

246
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,800
I mean, clearly, someone was out to get--
shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

247
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,200
What?

248
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,800
police! Stop!

249
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,000
Stop!

250
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,600
Damn it!

251
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,600
Damn it.

252
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,300
 It's not that unusual 

253
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,000
I spent half the nht trying to decipher these things, only came up with three words.

254
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,300
You'read that I went back to the apartment without you.

255
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,800
I'm mad you didn't catch the guy.

256
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,400
No, I'm mad I didn't catch the guy.

257
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,500
You're mad that I didn't arrest the reporter.

258
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,600
Jacobi, I asked the super. He did let her in.

259
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:30,600
So far, I've got alibis from every corrupt jerk theresa woo exposed in the last three years,

260
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,000
leaving her current story,

261
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,400
whatever it is...

262
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,500
as our best lead.

263
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
What about the guy last night?

264
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,100
Didn't my...

265
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,500
sketch come back yet?

266
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,800
I think martha is depressed.

267
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,100
You should--

268
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,300
I am not taking the dog.

269
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,600
You're mad at me about the dog?

270
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,800
(Man) that goes upstairs, the new boss' office.

271
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,000
They named the new lieu.

272
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,200
It's not you?

273
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,300
What idiot d the idiots in charge give it to?

274
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,900
(Man) this idiot.

275
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,400
Tom.

276
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,600
I tried to call you four times.

277
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,300
I'm gonna need a minute.

278
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,500
Jacobi has 22 years on the job,

279
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,600
more citations than I can count.

280
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,400
He's seasoned,

281
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,000
he'S... grizzled.

282
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Do you know how many bad guys you have to catch to get that grizzled?

283
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,900
A lot.

284
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,400
That's right, a lot.

285
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,300
What has tom done?

286
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,900
Other than reorganize the citywide gang task force and that huge drug bust?

287
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,200
Blah, blah, blah.

288
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,900
Jacobi deserves to be the new lieu.

289
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,700
Why would tom take the job?

290
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,300
Do you think he's mae...

291
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,400
exploring the idea of getting back together?

292
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,200
It's possible. Things change.

293
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,300
Well, I care about my job the same amount as I did when we were married.

294
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,100
That hasn't changed.

295
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,900
But tom didn't leave you because you cared about your job.

296
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,600
He left because it was all you cared about.

297
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,600
Why are we friends?

298
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,400
Because I always tell you the truth,

299
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,100
just like I did when I warned you,that whole thing

300
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,700
about the kiss me not killer--

301
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,300
obsession.

302
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,000
I did not say it--

303
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,900
but yes, obsession--was going to cost yoyour marriage.

304
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,500
That psycho murdered two women.

305
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
He brutalized them.

306
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,300
He sewed their lips shut.

307
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:18,800
We know.

308
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,700
We were there, too.

309
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,400
You both gave up.

310
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,200
So did tom.

311
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,800
Yeah, to change the subject,

312
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,100
this is why I am not moving in with luke.

313
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,100
Moving in leads to marriage,

314
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,600
marriage leads to... ick.

315
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,200
I'm giving the key back.

316
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,200
If it's the right guy, the ick's worth it. Trust me.

317
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,300
(man) um, miss bernhardt?

318
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,000
Tom wasn't the right guy.

319
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,300
He was a youthful mistake.

320
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,800
That lasted six years.

321
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,900
Four of them really happy, if you remember.

322
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,300
And now he's my boss.

323
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,300
We're adults. It'll be fine.

324
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,900
five years ago, theresa filed a restraining order against a walton james.

325
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,500
She e kept it active until last year.

326
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,100
Theresa had a stalker.

327
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,100
I'm betting he looked a little something like this.

328
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,800
Mr. James, open up!It's the police!

329
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,000
Elevator! He's going to the elevator!

330
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,100
Walton james...

331
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,000
You are under arrest for pissing me off...

332
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,100
twice.

333
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,000
You have no right.

334
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,400
I'm an american citizen!

335
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,399
Touch nothing!

336
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,400
yeah. Whatever you say.

337
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,300
this picture is recent.

338
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,400
If he was still following her, why the hell would
 she let the restraing order lapse?

339
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,700
Stupidity?

340
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,200
I just figured out how a professional stalker can afford these digs

341
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,300
and how he met our victim.

342
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,900
"Police brutality strikes again."

343
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,900
I remember this.

344
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,100
Yeah, he was one ofhe protesters who got their butts kicked at that, uh, world bank to-do,

345
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,500
sued the city and got a tidy settlement.

346
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,700
She turned him into a hero for a day.

347
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,000
He turned her into a victim for five years.

348
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,600
Yeah...

349
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,500
it seems that way, doesn't it?

350
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,500
So what happened, walton?

351
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,600
Uh, theresa finally have enough, so you let her free-fall?

352
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,800
I have rights.

353
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,900
Those rights don't include murder.

354
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,700
I know how the police operate.

355
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,100
You're liars. You're bullies.

356
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,900
You want me to believe she's dead

357
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,400
so I'll tell you everything I know.

358
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,000
Walton, it's on the news.

359
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,900
It's in all the papers.

360
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,800
Everything we see, everything we hear,

361
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,800
it--it's--it's--it's been manipulated by governments

362
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,300
and--and corporations.

363
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,900
That's why theresa's so special.

364
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,800
That's why you were snooping outside of her place.

365
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,900
I was trying to find out why she was killed.

366
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,000
Where'd you send her?

367
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,700
Guantanamo?

368
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,300
theresa is under that sheet, walton.

369
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,300
You ready for this?

370
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,600
(Laughs) it's a replica...

371
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,000
or something.

372
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,900
You people are exceptionally well-funded.

373
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,400
No, trust me, we're not 

374
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,800
walton, theresa was shot and pushed off a building.

375
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,000
Were you there?

376
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,900
Do you remember?

377
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,300
(Crying) who did this?

378
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,400
Huh? Who...

379
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,800
who hurt you?

380
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,600
Walton--

381
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,600
no. (Cries)

382
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,800
theresa.

383
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,700
Please, no! No!

384
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,700
Walton, come on. 
No! (Groans)

385
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,300
okay, I got him, I got him.

386
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,600
it's all right.

387
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,900
(Whispers) it's all right.It's all right. It's okay.

388
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,600
Theresa.

389
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,500
it's all right.

390
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,000
No.It's all right.

391
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,600
???

392
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,000
Hanson north, aren't you supposed to be in court defending a murdering crackhead?

393
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,100
We're on a recess.

394
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,400
Meantime, I'm waiting for someone to explain to me

395
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
why this department tortured walton james.

396
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,600
Showing him theresa woo's body is a long way

397
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,700
from the water board.

398
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,000
Your client did not believe she was dead.

399
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,200
We had to determine whether he'd had a psychotic bre.

400
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,800
Uh, during which maybe he shoved her off a building.

401
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,700
And?

402
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,200
And we don't think he did it,

403
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,500
but we do think he has information relevant to theresa's murder.

404
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,800
Well, I can't let you talk to him.

405
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,200
Sorry, should've beaten it out of him when you had the chance.

406
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,500
We understand.

407
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,300
Of course, that means I'll have to file against him

408
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,000
for assault on a police officer,

409
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,100
destruction of federal property,

410
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,200
on top of the evading charge--

411
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,800
that'd easily get him a dime in prison.

412
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,200
Or he sits down for a friendly rap session. It's up to you.

413
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:25,500
Okay, but only because I've gotta go decimate a traffic cop on the stand.

414
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,600
Hey, lindsay,

415
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,500
we should talk.

416
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,400
Yeah, sure, just not now.

417
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,300
"Not now," the lindsay boxer refrain.

418
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,000
Don't be an ass, tom.

419
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,300
"Don't be an ass...

420
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,500
lieutenant."

421
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,400
lieutenant.

422
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,700
God, he is so irritating.

423
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,900
Public defenders can be so sanctimonious.

424
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,600
You meant tom. Right.

425
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,400
You really think walton's innocent?

426
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,400
Theresa was scared, but not of him.

427
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,200
She let the restraining order lapse.

428
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,400
In some of walton's photos,

429
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,600
she's lookin directly into the lens.

430
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,000
She even kept some of his favorite soda on the fire escape.

431
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,900
I think she liked him.

432
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,700
You know, he planted her flower box

433
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,900


434
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,200


435
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,600
really heavy water bottles.

436
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,100
Right. It's like a silent, lurking husband.

437
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,100
It sounds... almost nice.

438
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
martha?

439
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,200
(Clears throat) hey, baby.

440
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,200
I'm sorry you had to see theresa like that.

441
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,600
I know you didn't hurt her.

442
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,300
You don't trust me.

443
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,700
That's--that'S... okay.

444
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,900
But theresa did.

445
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,300
 Lindsay, it's theresa woo.

446
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,900
 I was hoping you could meet me.

447
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,700
 3rd street newsstand, 8:00 A.M.

448
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,200
 I know we're not exactly friends, but it's important.

449
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
 Thanks, lindsay.

450
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,700
 See you in the morning.

451
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,100
Theresa started the crime beat 

452
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,100
the same time that I joined the force.

453
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,100
The first time I ever saw my name in print

454
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,000
was in one of her articles.

455
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,000
We kinda grew up together.

456
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,300
Walton, as much as you cared about her,

457
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,500
that's how much I care about catching her killer.

458
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,200
how's she doing?

459
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,600
Lindsay's the best,just like always.

460
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,500
That's not what I meant.

461
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,800
I know what you meant.

462
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,500
 (Lindsay) was there someone that she was afraid of?

463
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,100
Maybe someone she was doing a story on?

464
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,400
Was it her new boyfriend? Do you know who he is?

465
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,600
Someone was following her.

466
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,300
Who?

467
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,100
I don't know her name,

468
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,900
but I kn--

469
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,500
I know her license plate number.

470
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,900
Okay.

471
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,700
Okay.

472
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,900
Martha likes you.

473
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Maybe she should go home with you, huh?

474
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,900
Hallelujah. (Chuckles)

475
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,300
crackhead plead out.

476
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,500
Your boss signed off on manslaughter, 10 to 20,up for parole in 5.

477
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
Not bad for shooting grandma in the heart.

478
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
Why are you here?

479
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Why'd you stop returning my calls?

480
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,800
Walton gave up a license plate number.

481
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,700
It's that too-soft-for-a-man E.R. Doctor, isn't it?

482
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,300
You should dump him.

483
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,200
I need my desk, okay?

484
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,400
you really like this guy?

485
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,900
I really like this guy.

486
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,800
Then dump him before it's too late.

487
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,600
I know you. You're like me,

488
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,500
too complicated to commit.

489
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,100
Once again, I ask,

490
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,000
why are you here?

491
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You really want to know?

492
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,400
Yes.

493
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,100
You sure?

494
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,100
Yes.

495
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,900
Luke and I are in love.

496
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,600
We're moving in together, and you don't know me.

497
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,900
Yeah, I do.

498
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:40,600
An effective whitening

499
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,300
For one thing, you're more experienced.

500
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,100
Dr. Raine van aiken.

501
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,000
She doesn't look like a murderer.

502
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm just saying, the promotion...

503
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,300
it should have been mine, I know.

504
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,900
Now will you stop dragging me

505
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,600
and my ego into a situation that's really about you

506
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,900
and a much more vital organ?

507
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,600
You better be talking about my heart.

508
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,300
Her.

509
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,600
The short version is,

510
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,300
I'm glad theresa woo is dead.

511
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,100
Most people don't lead with cartwheels after a murder.

512
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,900
Most murder victims aren't sleeping with my husband.

513
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,500
I assume that's why you're here.

514
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,300
You connected the affair dots

515
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,400
and figured that the crazy, jealous wife

516
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,200
offed the inepid reporter mistress.

517
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,300
Your car was seen following theresa,

518
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,200
uh, more than once.

519
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,000
My husband cheats...

520
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,800
regularly.

521
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,700
I feel it's my prerogative to know with whom.

522
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,600
I tell them to get lost,

523
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,900
and most listen.

524
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,000
And if they don't, you what,toss them off a roof?

525
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,600
Please.

526
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,900
Miles is my third husband.

527
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,600
I'm over the drama.

528
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,800
I'm surprised you're not over him.

529
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,400
Miles has his flaws,

530
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,000
but he makes me laugh,

531
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,600
and he knows his way around the kitchen,

532
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,700
and that's more than I can say for the first two.

533
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,300
If you knew our investigation would lead to you and your husband,

534
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,300
why didn't you come forward?

535
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,900
I work 80 hours a week running this free clinic,

536
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,300
helping the homeless and other people

537
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,500
who have no place else to go.

538
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,900
Enmeshing myself in all of this just wasn't a priority.

539
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,200
We're gonna need an alibi.

540
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,300
And, uh, we'll need to talk to your husband.

541
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,700
Scare the hell out of him.

542
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,100
He deserves it.

543
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,300
I'm gonna make a quick stop.

544
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,000
Do you want to--

545
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,500
pick up the cheating husband?

546
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,300
A pleasure.

547
00:24:21,842 --> 00:24:23,028
I don't talk to reporters...

548
00:24:23,143 --> 00:24:23,819
yeah,

549
00:24:24,322 --> 00:24:25,577
I got that general idea.

550
00:24:25,661 --> 00:24:28,218
But I need to know what was in theresa's head, okay?

551
00:24:28,308 --> 00:24:30,976
Anything about her job,her personal life,

552
00:24:31,055 --> 00:24:32,454
and at theresa's apartment,

553
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:33,874
you seemed to think that you could read these.

554
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:34,327
Probably.

555
00:24:34,703 --> 00:24:36,244
How?
Eidetic memory.

556
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:39,224
It's just, I-I-I have one of those brains

557
00:24:39,295 --> 00:24:42,626
that has a hard time forgetting things,so if--if I knew it,if I read about it,

558
00:24:42,963 --> 00:24:44,716
you know,
even if I heard about it once,

559
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:46,977
chances are good it is still in there somewhere,

560
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:50,909
uh, like, well, say code or obsolete shorthand.

561
00:24:51,371 --> 00:24:52,693
You read about shorthand?

562
00:24:53,036 --> 00:24:54,056
I read about a lot of things.

563
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:58,814
Shorthand, baseball, keynesian economics, serial killers.

564
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:02,857
I read all about the kiss me not killer case,

565
00:25:02,951 --> 00:25:04,225
and--and I-I was thinking,

566
00:25:04,284 --> 00:25:06,706
if you ever wanted to reopen the investigation,

567
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:08,779
I-I would love to assist youin any
stop.Here's an F.Y.I.

568
00:25:09,102 --> 00:25:12,299
If you write a story containing any information from those notebooks,

569
00:25:12,373 --> 00:25:13,353
without my go-ahead,

570
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:15,670
I'll arrest you. For what?

571
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,524
Breaking and entering...
there's nothing--obstructio

572
00:25:18,068 --> 00:25:18,975
I'll come up with a list.

573
00:25:23,947 --> 00:25:26,111
Theresa came into my restaurant,

574
00:25:26,184 --> 00:25:27,658
and we talked.

575
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,909
And then she came back,and...

576
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,380
one thing, as they say,led to another.

577
00:25:33,474 --> 00:25:34,247
It seems like one thing,

578
00:25:34,321 --> 00:25:36,621
as they say,leads to another a lot with you.

579
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:39,299
My wife is married to her work.

580
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,241
Uh, what am i supposed to do?

581
00:25:41,324 --> 00:25:43,927
Oh, so because you don't get enough attention,

582
00:25:44,011 --> 00:25:45,486
everything is your wife's fault?

583
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,481
Did you ever think,

584
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:47,529
I don't know,

585
00:25:47,604 --> 00:25:49,182
maybe your wife's job is important to her,

586
00:25:49,244 --> 00:25:51,480
or you should be a little more understanding?

587
00:25:52,966 --> 00:25:54,024
what's her problem?

588
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:57,499
She's touched at how choked up you are over this whole thing.

589
00:25:57,584 --> 00:25:59,316
Hey, I cared about theresa,

590
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,909
but I was going to end it.

591
00:26:00,984 --> 00:26:02,804
Because she threatened to tell your wife?

592
00:26:02,876 --> 00:26:05,790
No, because she reminded me of my wife.

593
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:11,221
Theresa turned out to be a unromantic,work-obsessed ballbuster.

594
00:26:11,305 --> 00:26:13,560
Mm. Uh, I've already got one of those.

595
00:26:13,626 --> 00:26:17,355
So you took your anger at raine out on theresa?

596
00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:18,293
Transference.

597
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:19,249
That's a good theory.

598
00:26:19,308 --> 00:26:22,307
Excuse me. Instead of tting yourselves on the back,

599
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:24,934
shouldn't you be out arresting the real killer--

600
00:26:25,476 --> 00:26:27,165
walton james--theresa's stalker?

601
00:26:27,236 --> 00:26:29,239
Where were you yesterday morning?

602
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:33,301
W-w-waitthis guy followed heraround for five years.

603
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:36,791
I mean, we used to have to meet when she knew he wasn't watching

604
00:26:36,867 --> 00:26:38,965
because she was afraid that--that he'd lose it.

605
00:26:39,608 --> 00:26:41,202
Any alibi will do.

606
00:26:46,001 --> 00:26:47,750
I was at my restaurant,

607
00:26:48,281 --> 00:26:50,491
and I have the manager,

608
00:26:51,004 --> 00:26:54,207
two prep cooks and an entire waitstaff who'll attest to that.

609
00:26:54,664 --> 00:26:56,922
I so want him to be guilty.

610
00:26:56,997 --> 00:27:01,091
Well, he's guilty of lowering the overall standards of san francisco cuisine.

611
00:27:01,715 --> 00:27:02,520
Last I checked,

612
00:27:02,568 --> 00:27:06,673
that restaurant he's so proud of had a big, fat "c" from the health department.

613
00:27:06,717 --> 00:27:07,311
where are we?

614
00:27:08,184 --> 00:27:11,777
I would like a tail for miles van aiken to make sure he doesn't try to leave the city.

615
00:27:12,489 --> 00:27:13,992
If I say yes,will you agree to that talk?

616
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,736
I will pencil you in ten minutes

617
00:27:15,806 --> 00:27:17,733
past--a woman is dead.
Oh.

618
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:21,952
I'll, uh, head over to the so-called restaurant,verify van aiken's alibi.

619
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,893
I'll approve the tail,

620
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:27,137
but don't get so focused on the jerk husband

621
00:27:27,218 --> 00:27:28,278
that you forget the story angle.

622
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,499
Yeah, thanks for the reminder, tom.

623
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:34,334
Thanks for the reminder,lieutenant.

624
00:27:34,845 --> 00:27:38,607
I need a search warrant for miles van aiken's car,the restaurant, his house.

625
00:27:38,673 --> 00:27:39,486
Yeah. Based on?

626
00:27:40,357 --> 00:27:42,560
I don't like the cheating bastard?

627
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:46,373
Sweetie, you know, I love you like an annoyingly pushy,emotionally stunted sister,

628
00:27:46,453 --> 00:27:47,854
but I need probable cause.

629
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:51,061
Linz.
Yeah.

630
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,766
I did something bad.

631
00:27:53,961 --> 00:27:55,278
What? You okay?

632
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:56,265
Yeah.

633
00:27:57,283 --> 00:27:58,510
It's just, I, uh...

634
00:28:00,294 --> 00:28:01,357
I didn't tell you

635
00:28:01,428 --> 00:28:03,581
that tom asked about you.

636
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:04,967
whatever.

637
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:07,557
You can stop pretending you're not still in love with him anytime now.

638
00:28:09,478 --> 00:28:12,010
Come on. You haven't even had sex with anyone since he left.

639
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:13,392
Says who?

640
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:17,416
I could've been secretly whoring around the last two years.

641
00:28:17,512 --> 00:28:21,372
And besides, I am picky,and I'm busy,

642
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:23,427
and I have to solve a murder now.

643
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:28,357
Hey, it's me. Where are we?

644
00:28:28,442 --> 00:28:31,189
I, uh, managed to figure out some key words in the notebook.

645
00:28:32,035 --> 00:28:34,049
"Caboose," "elephant man."

646
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,417
I still have no idea exactly what they mean.

647
00:28:37,485 --> 00:28:38,645
So we're at another dead end?

648
00:28:38,721 --> 00:28:39,775
I have another idea.

649
00:28:39,813 --> 00:28:40,777
I'll let you know if it works.

650
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,626
Walton?

651
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:49,263
Cindy thomas...

652
00:28:50,668 --> 00:28:54,627
from the... "san francisco register"?

653
00:29:01,602 --> 00:29:02,489
walton?

654
00:29:03,204 --> 00:29:04,172
Hello? Oh!

655
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:05,122
Oh!

656
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:12,441
body's still warm.

657
00:29:13,025 --> 00:29:15,483
I'd say T.O.D.Is less than two hours ago.

658
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:16,877
This doesn't make any sense.

659
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:19,739
What is it with that girl and otr people's apartments?

660
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:21,595
I gave her theresa's notebooks.

661
00:29:23,302 --> 00:29:25,795
She thought that walton might be able to make sense out of them,

662
00:29:25,796 --> 00:29:27,632
which he doesn't need to know.

663
00:29:27,742 --> 00:29:28,924
It's a confession.

664
00:29:29,008 --> 00:29:30,542
Unis found it in the bedroom.

665
00:29:31,032 --> 00:29:33,705
Walton couldn't handle theresa having a boyfriend,

666
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:34,994
kill her in a jealous rage.

667
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:38,051
No, theresa made sure walton didn't know about miles.

668
00:29:38,131 --> 00:29:39,217
Lindsay, case is closed.

669
00:29:39,775 --> 00:29:41,538
It isn't closed.
Yes, it is.
Isn'T.
Is.

670
00:29:41,601 --> 00:29:43,015
Damn it, tom,just let me do my job.

671
00:29:43,095 --> 00:29:46,173
Fine, if after you do your job,

672
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:49,344
you come into my office,you sit your ass down,and we talk. No excuses.

673
00:29:50,523 --> 00:29:51,082
Fine.

674
00:29:53,232 --> 00:29:55,532
You planned that.Halfway through.

675
00:29:56,057 --> 00:29:57,238
It was fun, huh?

676
00:29:57,788 --> 00:29:59,668
Yeah, hoot and a holler.

677
00:30:07,256 --> 00:30:07,887
How much longer?

678
00:30:07,981 --> 00:30:09,157
With or without your hovering?

679
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:10,252
Without.

680
00:30:12,323 --> 00:30:13,466
It's just so sad.

681
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,641
All theresa and walton had was each other, and now...

682
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:21,072
I mean, I get how walton ended up alone. He was kind of a nut.

683
00:30:21,138 --> 00:30:22,098
But theresa...

684
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:23,538
how does that happen?

685
00:30:24,347 --> 00:30:25,816
You put your head down,

686
00:30:25,895 --> 00:30:27,130
you get lost in your career,

687
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,373
you wake up ten years later,

688
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,514
and you realize that your job doesn't hug back.

689
00:30:31,647 --> 00:30:34,086
Theresa chose to be alone,whether she meant to or not.

690
00:30:34,654 --> 00:30:36,820
She was avoiding the ick.

691
00:30:39,345 --> 00:30:40,482
Hello.

692
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,690
See what happens when no one hovers?

693
00:30:43,765 --> 00:30:44,637
Check this out.

694
00:30:44,697 --> 00:30:48,162
When you hang yourself, the rope leaves a bruise, like this,

695
00:30:48,256 --> 00:30:49,726
only this one's pretty faint.

696
00:30:50,447 --> 00:30:53,463
Here, he's got a slightly darker bruise,

697
00:30:53,534 --> 00:30:57,003
which means that he was strangled and then strung up.

698
00:30:57,077 --> 00:30:58,942
And since there's no sign of a struggle,

699
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,100
I'm guessing he was drugged first.

700
00:31:02,642 --> 00:31:05,776
Hey. That reporter girl's here with a guest.

701
00:31:06,705 --> 00:31:08,025
What is that smell?

702
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:10,176
Elephant man.

703
00:31:10,697 --> 00:31:11,360
See his necklace?

704
00:31:11,882 --> 00:31:13,039
I cracked the code.

705
00:31:13,593 --> 00:31:15,232
So theresa's story was about you?

706
00:31:15,312 --> 00:31:17,122
Me and a whole bunch ofs street dudes.

707
00:31:17,194 --> 00:31:20,086
You're talking about that story she did five months ago,

708
00:31:20,152 --> 00:31:24,945
on that bottom-feeder who coerced homeless mento smack each other around on video.

709
00:31:25,012 --> 00:31:26,386
I wasn't involved in all that,

710
00:31:26,902 --> 00:31:28,173
but I got to know theresa.

711
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:33,323
After that, she kept coming around with food and blankets on cold nights.

712
00:31:33,381 --> 00:31:34,442
Yeah, so she was there,

713
00:31:34,498 --> 00:31:37,700
uh, six weeks ago when martin fell and he cut his head open.

714
00:31:37,785 --> 00:31:40,332
She took him to get treatment at mission cross north hospital,

715
00:31:40,386 --> 00:31:42,249
and the thing is,because martin is homeless,

716
00:31:42,306 --> 00:31:45,704
they automatically called the castro free clinic to see if he had medical records there.

717
00:31:45,758 --> 00:31:47,705
Then they wouldn't give me any pain pills.

718
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:51,584
Said that my medical records showed I was already on all kinds of stuff.

719
00:31:51,646 --> 00:31:55,777
Thought I was, u uh, what--what they call that?Drug seeking.Yeah.
But he--he wasn'T.

720
00:31:56,405 --> 00:31:57,835
Uh, martin's not on anything.

721
00:31:57,906 --> 00:31:59,179
Theresa had his blood tested.

722
00:31:59,245 --> 00:32:00,206
It's all in the notebooks.

723
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,590
I never even been to castro free clinic,

724
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:07,177
unless you're counting getting free food off that van they got going around sometimes.

725
00:32:07,252 --> 00:32:08,168
Hi. It's me. Hold on.

726
00:32:09,203 --> 00:32:11,885
This is my boyfriend luke. He's a doctor over at mission cross north.

727
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:14,680
With your permission,he's gonna fax over those medical records.

728
00:32:17,682 --> 00:32:20,100
No car, no electricity.Cough for me.

729
00:32:21,966 --> 00:32:23,724
I got a zero-carbon footprint.

730
00:32:23,795 --> 00:32:25,446
Ahh. Well, that's it.

731
00:32:25,535 --> 00:32:26,761
You're a prince, martin.

732
00:32:28,712 --> 00:32:30,972
So, uh, you coming with?

733
00:32:31,047 --> 00:32:32,053
I'm giving her some space.

734
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,822
In the meantime,I think I'm gonna take martin here down to the showers.

735
00:32:35,902 --> 00:32:37,185
And waste all that water?

736
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,261
Unh-unh.

737
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:45,413
Okay, I'm no internist,but pending blood work and urinalysis,

738
00:32:45,907 --> 00:32:48,206
I'd say he'll live to be 102.

739
00:32:49,696 --> 00:32:52,150
So the diabete the bad back,

740
00:32:52,253 --> 00:32:53,201
the high blood pressure...

741
00:32:53,275 --> 00:32:54,184
fake, fake, fake,

742
00:32:54,761 --> 00:32:56,485
all by dr. Raine van aiken.

743
00:32:56,589 --> 00:32:58,412
Which means we've got the wife for fraud and malpractice,

744
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:00,964
but as for the murders,we have nothing that's not circumstantial.

745
00:33:02,402 --> 00:33:04,647
Which makes getting the confession all the more fun.

746
00:33:06,246 --> 00:33:08,688
do you three have some sort of, uh, thing?

747
00:33:09,752 --> 00:33:11,864
Mm, we're friends.We share information.

748
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,706
What, like a club?no.

749
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:19,826
Not a club.Got it.

750
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:25,318
Well, it's just gonna be the two of us.

751
00:33:25,425 --> 00:33:26,379
It's easier to talk.

752
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:32,090
Good. Your partner's got issues.haven't met a woman yet who doesn'T.

753
00:33:34,126 --> 00:33:37,273
he said we were coming down here to talk about walton james.

754
00:33:37,358 --> 00:33:38,008
What's going on?

755
00:33:38,111 --> 00:33:40,276
There have been some new developments in the case.

756
00:33:40,346 --> 00:33:44,094
Look, no one is saying you meant for this thing to happen.

757
00:33:44,165 --> 00:33:47,758
A girl gets crazy over the affair,situation goes out of control,

758
00:33:48,306 --> 00:33:49,097
I understand.

759
00:33:49,173 --> 00:33:52,631
Eh--this is ridiculous. I mean,I've had a lot of affairs.I haven't killed them.

760
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,127
Yeah, you've had a lot of affairs...

761
00:33:56,188 --> 00:34:00,270
but the others weren't about to, uh, expose your wife.

762
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,028
Expose raine for what?

763
00:34:04,249 --> 00:34:05,128
You're nuts.

764
00:34:05,206 --> 00:34:07,179
Oh, that "c" from the health department,

765
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:09,489
I mean, it dive-bombed your restaurant profits.

766
00:34:09,552 --> 00:34:11,654
You needed an influx of cash to keep it afloat.

767
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,852
Yeah, my wife helped.

768
00:34:13,924 --> 00:34:14,705
It's not illegal.

769
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:17,710
Unless, she's, uh,stealing from the government

770
00:34:17,785 --> 00:34:20,227
and submitting the false medical claims to do it.

771
00:34:20,743 --> 00:34:21,405
No.

772
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,000
Now right when your restaurant started to slide,

773
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,620
raine's clinic instituted a new program for the homeless.

774
00:34:27,311 --> 00:34:29,931
Uh, register your vitals,get a square meal.

775
00:34:29,975 --> 00:34:35,114
It sounds generous,except...raine uses the information to make fake charts,

776
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:38,935
and then she bills the government for services not rendered.

777
00:34:38,984 --> 00:34:39,808
You can't prove that.

778
00:34:40,262 --> 00:34:43,720
Actually, we can. D.A.'S already signed off on your indictment.

779
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,568
Do-good doctor with no criminal record--

780
00:34:46,963 --> 00:34:49,577
you went way out of your box to get the money to save your husband's restaurant.

781
00:34:50,624 --> 00:34:51,496
You know what I think?

782
00:34:52,725 --> 00:34:55,247
I think you put up with miles' cheating because you love him.

783
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:57,802
Oh,and this is interesting.

784
00:34:58,412 --> 00:35:01,653
You and theresa didn't happen to meet.

785
00:35:02,265 --> 00:35:04,967
No, theresa was investigating your wife,

786
00:35:05,512 --> 00:35:08,453
but she couldn't get anywhere because raine's too careful.

787
00:35:08,842 --> 00:35:13,665
So theresa showed up at your restaurant and made sure, one thing,

788
00:35:13,734 --> 00:35:15,787
as they say, led to another.

789
00:35:16,117 --> 00:35:19,168
She used you to get to raine's home computer files.

790
00:35:19,758 --> 00:35:21,127
It's all in her notebooks.

791
00:35:21,207 --> 00:35:22,870
And when you found out,

792
00:35:23,381 --> 00:35:24,590
well, you had to kill her.

793
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:25,589
You didn't have a choice.

794
00:35:26,055 --> 00:35:26,606
No.

795
00:35:26,682 --> 00:35:29,043
And that poor sucker walton, well, you knocked him out--

796
00:35:29,096 --> 00:35:31,290
probably with drugs you stole from your wife's office--

797
00:35:31,334 --> 00:35:33,146
and you strung him up like a side of beef.

798
00:35:33,181 --> 00:35:34,580
Now we've got a search warrant.

799
00:35:34,642 --> 00:35:35,568
We're gonna find the gun.

800
00:35:35,621 --> 00:35:37,502
This isn't fair.You have to stop.

801
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,127
Two people are dead.We can't stop.

802
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:40,740
Someone has to pay.

803
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:42,367
It's only a matter of time.

804
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:42,865
No.

805
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,215
Two murders,both premeditated.

806
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,781
At's special circumstances.

807
00:35:48,923 --> 00:35:50,442
That's death penalty,miles.

808
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:51,916
Stop.

809
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:55,944
I'll tell you.

810
00:35:58,246 --> 00:35:59,788
Okay, jacobi,take a breather.

811
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,571
First I thought it was just another affair,

812
00:36:05,825 --> 00:36:15,292
so I followed her,like always. I watched
her walk into my house with my husband.

813
00:36:16,023 --> 00:36:24,315
She found everything.
She would've destroyed our careers,our lives.

814
00:36:25,562 --> 00:36:28,050
I had to protect us.

815
00:36:30,216 --> 00:36:33,269
It took a few days, but...I got a gun.

816
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,441
Miles didn't know...about any of it.

817
00:36:38,495 --> 00:36:40,332
How did you get walton
to write the confession?

818
00:36:41,086 --> 00:36:46,131
I held a gun to his head...
but it didn't work

819
00:36:49,116 --> 00:36:51,586
so I held a gun to the dog's head.

820
00:36:52,338 --> 00:36:56,614
he wrote what I wanted,word for word.

821
00:36:58,579 --> 00:36:59,885
So you stole for him.

822
00:37:00,363 --> 00:37:01,589
You killed for him.

823
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,399
Ultimately,you confessed for him.

824
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,665
If it weren't so utterly evil,it'd almost be poetic.

825
00:37:20,562 --> 00:37:22,264
here's the thing--I don't need to talk.

826
00:37:22,749 --> 00:37:27,986
Because showing up at work to find your
ex-husband is your new boss isn't a big deal?

827
00:37:28,434 --> 00:37:29,271
Were you watching me?

828
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,065
You were good.

829
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:32,811
So good you make me doubt how good I am.

830
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,854
Guess I'm gonna have to get used
to that all over again.

831
00:37:37,979 --> 00:37:41,256
I don't suppose you ever cheated on me.

832
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:46,122
You really need an answer?

833
00:37:46,678 --> 00:37:47,433
No.

834
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:52,521
Look, linz, we were married.
That comes with stf.Good stuff, bad stuff,

835
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:56,267
but stuff,and we can not talk
about it,but it's there

836
00:37:56,914 --> 00:37:57,973
.Works for me.

837
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,269
At least you're predictable.

838
00:38:03,607 --> 00:38:06,565
Okay, the not talking
when we were married,

839
00:38:06,641 --> 00:38:09,090
that's totally different
than the not talking now.

840
00:38:09,178 --> 00:38:15,257
It is.I avoided the talks back
then because, according to claire,

841
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:18,404
I-I was scared of beingn love with you.

842
00:38:18,991 --> 00:38:23,145
And now? Well, now I-I'm not in love with you,

843
00:38:23,229 --> 00:38:24,484
so there's simply no need.

844
00:38:24,551 --> 00:38:28,721
Okay. Look, uh...
never mind what I was gonna say.

845
00:38:28,796 --> 00:38:30,207
It's, uh, it's irrelevant.

846
00:38:30,282 --> 00:38:31,275
Okay.

847
00:38:34,292 --> 00:38:35,178
What's irrelevant?

848
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:40,897
Just...I'm getting married.

849
00:38:42,852 --> 00:38:47,712
Oh.Is she a cop?

850
00:38:47,802 --> 00:38:50,849
Kindergarten teacher.Her name is heather.

851
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:56,792
That's great.That's great.

852
00:38:56,862 --> 00:38:58,317
Uh... congratulations....

853
00:39:01,242 --> 00:39:02,774
lieutenant.

854
00:39:06,368 --> 00:39:07,286
hi, baby.

855
00:39:07,964 --> 00:39:09,112
Dad ordered pizza.

856
00:39:09,202 --> 00:39:10,281
So I see.

857
00:39:13,207 --> 00:39:14,361
So can I get a kiss?

858
00:39:14,988 --> 00:39:15,794
We're eating.

859
00:39:15,873 --> 00:39:17,707
She wasn't talking to you.

860
00:40:00,218 --> 00:40:00,894
I brought beer.

861
00:40:03,457 --> 00:40:04,875
And...

862
00:40:12,737 --> 00:40:13,819
does this mean...

863
00:40:15,722 --> 00:40:16,611
This means.

864
00:40:41,577 --> 00:40:42,281
boxer.

865

866
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:08,325
look, rojas was on call,but I reassigned the caseto you.

867
00:41:24,236 --> 00:41:25,216
lindsay.

868
00:41:25,886 --> 00:41:26,670
It's bad.

869
00:41:34,888 --> 00:41:35,952
Kiss me not.

870
00:41:36,779 --> 00:41:38,404
He's back.

871
00:42:05,912 --> 00:42:07,107
we'll get him.

872
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,816
This time we'll stop him.
