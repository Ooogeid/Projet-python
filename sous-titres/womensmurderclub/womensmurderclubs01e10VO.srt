<i>Previously on
"women's murder club".</i>

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,100
That whole thing about
the kiss me not killer...
obsession.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,700
Was going to cost you

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,400
That psycho murdered two women.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,700
Kiss me not--
He's back.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,200
This time we'll stop him.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,400
The fbi is taking over
the case.
Those were my files.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,500
<i>I'm the one who filled out
the profile on that monster.</i>

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,300
<i>I stared i</i>

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,100
Lindsay, this obsession
is costing you, a lot.

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,500
Agent john ash. We've had
some new developments.

12
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,100
<i>We think you might be
his next victim.</i>

14
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,400
(Ash) you're, uh,
slow today.

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,100
Maybe you're
not sleeping well.

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,200
<i>Really? Do you have to
talk to me?</i>

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,000
Disturbed r.E.M. Patterns are
common side effect of fear.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,800
It's nothing
to be ashamed of.

19
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,800
Okay,
the only thing that i fear

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,800
Is that while you've been
lurking around my apartment

21
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,300
For the past nine days,
the kiss me not killer

22
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,500
Is out there
looking for his next victim.

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,600
The fbi believes
the next victim is you.

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,900
Because he sent a picture
of me with xs on my lips?

25
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,200
He is looking for attention,

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,900
Or he's creating a distraction.

27
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,700
Either way, cruising me while
i jog is not gonna find him.

28
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,600
(Cell phone ringing)
which is why you should
stop playing coy

29
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,200
And agree to help me
with the case.

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Boxer.

31
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,000
Hi.

32
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,800
What is it?
Okay, i'll be right there.

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,100
(Beep)
i spent five years on this case.
Now it's your turn.

34
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,600
I've profiled
dozens of serial killers.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,100
They rarely make idle threats,
inspector boxer.

36
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,500
Good thing i sleep
with a gun under my pillow.

37
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,300
Come on. Come on.
(Makes kissing sound)

38
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,100
Come on.

39
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,300
Your usual.

40
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,500
What's this info you
couldn't share over the phone?

41
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,400
I need $200...
in addition to my burgers.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,100
It's a bargain, believe me.

43
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,100
10% down.
Don't push it.

44
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,900
Follow me. Come on.

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,500
Okay, how about
a hint for my $20?

46
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,300
Just hang on, will you?

47
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,900
We're almost there.

48
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,000
You been taking your meds?

49
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,000
Meds? No.

50
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,900
Where are we going, skeet?

51
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,600
Just come in here, please.

52
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,900
There's someone that
i want you to meet.

53
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,800
Okay. Who?

54
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Him.

55
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,500
Whoa!

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,700
No, i really liked it, too.

58
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,800
Man, it hurts just lookin'
at it--I mean him.

59
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,400
"Silas spaulding." 41.

60
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,600
I... i guess he was
making a delivery.

61
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,400
2003 château chel blanc.

62
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,300
That's about $400 a pop.

63
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, skeet found the head
down the street.

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,600
It must have rolled
or... bounced.

65
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,000
The man finda severed head,
picks it up and takes it?

66
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,400
Tell me you didn't
give him money again.

67
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,900
Wow,
dismemberment by vehicle,

68
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,100
And--And judging
by those yaw marks,

69
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,800
This wasn't just
some random hit-And-Run.

70
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,200
I mean, somebody was
angry enough at this guy

71
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,500
<i>To hit him a few times.</i>

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,800
Did i mention how much i love
having tom out of town?

73
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,500
Well, you know,???

74
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,100
With a tan
and a wedding ring.

75
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,900
I'm gonna go check in
with jill.

76
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,800
Well, thanks for your help.

77
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,700
Uh, unis canvassed
the whole block.

78
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,600
I'd start taking affidavits,
but nobody saw anything.

79
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,300
Re you just
flirting with him?

80
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,200
Have i mentioned how happy i am???

81
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,700
Every day since you moved out
of luke's apartment.

82
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,000
Hey, i love my life,
except this part.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,800
This part sucks.

84
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,900
Hey! Is it true that
a homeless guy found a head?

85
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,000
Hey! Yeah. Let's not make it
sound like a good thing.

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,800
It's terrible thin
it's also front-Page material.
Ooh.

87
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,800
Oh! God.
Cadaver dog found this
in the gutter.

88
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,500
Front-Page,
above-The-Fold material.

89
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,400
"Silas and mia, 2005."

90
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,300
(Claire) married less
an three years.

91
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,200
That's still the honeymoon
phase... for some couples.

92
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,200
Mm.
Well, i'd say
the honeymoon is over.

93
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,100
I still don't understand.

94
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,100
Silas was walking,
and a car hit him,

95
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,600
And the person
just left him there...

96
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,900
Like roadkill?

97
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,500
We don't think
it was an accident.

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,300
You mean somebody...
what, like murder?

99
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,400
Did your husband
have any enemies?

100
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,800
I me, maybe somebody
he did business with?

101
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,900
No, no.

102
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,900
He and his business partner
laurent pernet...

103
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,900
(Sniffles)
they're best friends.

104
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,300
They built the, um,
wine business from nothing.

105
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,400
And we all go to the theater
together and to napa.

106
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Mrs. Spaulding, i'm sorry,
but we have to ask,

107
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,000
Um, where were you last night?

108
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,200
I, um, was home.

109
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,000
What time did silas
leave the house?

110
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,100
I don't--I don't know.

111
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,700
Please... search our house,
then search our car...

112
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,600
Anything to find out
who did this to him.

113
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,700
(Voice breaking)
'cause without silas,

114
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,100
That life, it...
it's just over.

115
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,200
Can i see my husband now?

116
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,400
That's probably
not a very good idea.

117
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,300
Hey, ms. Spaulding
gave us permission

118
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,000
To search her house
and her car.

119
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,900
That's a good sign
she didn't kill her husband.

120
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,900
It'd be a better sign
if she had any kind of alibi.

121
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,300
We'll need to subpoena
silas' business records,

122
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,600
See if you can get
mia's as well.

123
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
She does something
in commercial real estate.

124
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,300
Sure. I'll clear it
with denise.

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Wait.

126
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,200
Your voice didn't do that thing
when you said denise's name.

127
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,800
What thing?

128
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,700
The rumbly, trembly,
hate-Filled thing...

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,200
Which i'm sure nobody
but me has ever noticed.

130
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,000
Denise is no longer
a problem.

131
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,200
Ever since she got drunk
at tom and heather's wedding

132
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,300
And announced to luke
that i had had sex with hanson,

133
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,800
Thereby ending my relationship,
she's been a peach.

134
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,800
Turns out my boss is
actually capable of guilt.

135
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,800
I'm sorry, this event
is invitations-Only.

136
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,000
S.F.P.D. We're investigating
a murder.

137
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,700
Does that get us
on the guest list?

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We're lookin

139
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,100
Silas can't be d

140
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,500
I've left him, like, five really pissed-Off messages
on his cell.

141
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,700
That's why he hasn't--
His wife i.D.Ed his photo.

142
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,100
I can't believe this.

143
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,200
Oh, he was my best friend
for 20 years.

144
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,000
Tell me about your business.

145
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,500
We deal wine.

146
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,100
Silas and i
buy fr

147
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,500
And auction houses
all over the world

148
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,200
And resell
to the right clientele.

149
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,500
That's what we're doing...

150
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,500
<i>Were doing here today.</i>

151
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,500
Have there been
any problems lately,

152
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,200
Any dissatisfied customers?

153
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
No.

154
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You said he was carrying
the cheval blanc.

155
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,600
Maybe this was
a-A robbery that went bad.

156
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,100
We've been hit before.
All right, i'll look into it.

157
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,600
Uh, would you mind showing me
your car, please?

158
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,900
(Stammers) of course.

159
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,500
So you and silas were close,
mr. Atkinson?

160
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Actually, his dad
was my best friend.

161
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,400
Thank god he didn't live
to see this.

162
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,400
Did, uh, silas
and his partner get along?

163
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,200
Partnerships are like
marriages, one supposes,

164
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,700
Up and down.

165
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,600
Here. This was one
of silas' favorites.

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,200
Very expressive.

167
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,000
Uh... black currants...

168
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,900
(Sniffs) eucalyptus...
is that chocolate?

169
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,500
Distinguishing nose.

170
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,000
(Lowered voice) most of these
people can't tell

171
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,500
A fine cabernet
from 2 buck chuck. (Laughs)

172
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,700
(Chuckles) well, i dabble.

173
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,400
Uh, excuse me.

174
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,800
So the partner's car
is clean,

175
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,500
But i did get him
to agree to a polygraph.

176
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,800
Okay, well, let's head back
and see where we are

177
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,100
With those tire tracks.

178
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,500
Ah, listen, i'm gonna
make a cup of coffee.

179
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,700
I'll be back.
Okay.

180
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,700
(Gasps)
ohh!

181
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,100
Oh.
Sorry.

182
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,600
Heather... you're back!

183
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,900
Mm.
Tom's back.

184
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,100
Fresh from maui. We brought
everyone macadamia nuts.

185
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Oh.

186
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,600
Okay, look, um...

187
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,400
About me showing up
at your wedding

188
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,900
In the parking lot, i'm--
I'm really, really sorry.

189
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,400
Don't be.
I got a little crazy bride.

190
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,900
Anyway, i'm on my way
to the social security office

191
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,300
To change my last name.

192
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,800
Bye-E, heather donnelly.
Hello, heather hogan. (Laughs)

193
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,800
I was gonna bring tom with me,
'cause it's such a big deal,

194
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,500
But there's a guy
in his office.
What guy?

195
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,800
Uh, fbi guy?
Kind of a hottie.

196
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,100
Right. See ya.

197
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,400
Wellspeak of the devil.

198
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,600
Uh, can i speak to you,
lieutenant?

199
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,800
I'm in theiddle of a meeting,
inspector boxer.

200
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,100
Yes, sir, i can see that.

201
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,800
Um, this is fbi agent john ash.
Profiler.

202
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,800
He's requested your help

203
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,400
With the kiss me not killer
investigation.
Really?

204
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,000
I've told him that you are
too valuable to this departmt

205
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,700
To loan out to the fbi.
I agree.

206
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,000
You do?

207
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,300
The fbi has my files.

208
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,700
I'm sure the case is much better
off in their capable hands.

209
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,900
Um, sorry we couldn't be
more help.

210
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,300
Our office received this
in the mail nine days ago.

211
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,700
We don't think it's a hoax.

212
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,400
Kiss me not
is playing games, lieutenant.

213
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,800
He is not gonna hurt me.

214
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,300
You knew about this?

215
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,200
You've been on your honeymoon.
Did you request
a security detail,

216
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,600
Take any precautions?

217
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,000
I can take care of myself.
Oh, this is so typical!

218
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The kiss me not killer feels
a connection to inspector boxer,

219
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Which means she's gotten
into his head,

220
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,200
Which means
she's the best person

221
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,600
To help us solve this case.

222
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,000
Three women have been
murdered, possibly more.

223
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,800
He's not finished.
We can ensure her safety.

224
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,600
24-Hour detail?

225
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,500
Tom, what the hell?

226
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,400
You're the one
that wanted me to move on.

227
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,100
Remember how i was obsessed?
This case ruinur m

228
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,900
You...

229
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,200
We will protect her,
and we will find this guy.

230
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,900
Hello? I'm right here!

231
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,100
Mia spaulding,
victim's wife.

232
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,500
Lindsay boxer.
(Crying) inspector boxer?

233
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,000
I didn't kill silas.

234
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,400
Okay. Just--Just calm down,
talk to me.

235
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,100
I can't go on without him.

236
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,800
My life is over.
I want to be with silas.

237
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,700
Where aryou?
I'm at the golden gate bridge.

238
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,900
I just wanted you to know
i didn't do it.

239
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,600
Alert goldenate bridge
security. She's gonna jump.
Please find silas' killer!

240
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,000
Mia!
Good-Bye.

241
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,100
You are not leaving.
I am going down there!

242
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,900
I'll go! As of now,
you are on loan to the fbi.

243
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,600
Th really should be back
by now. I'm gonna call jacobi.

244
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,400
You are gonna tell me
about sarah rice.

245
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,000
Um, waitress.
Grew up in marin county.

246
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,100
Strangled in 2003.
She was 26.

247
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,100
You sound like you're reading
from a phone book.

248
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,000
You want
an interprive dance?

249
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,600
The kiss me not killer
laid her to rest

250
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,800
In a bed of lilacs.

251
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,600
They were still fresh
when we found her.

252
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,000
206 possible suspects
were questioned and dismissed.

253
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,800
Th

254
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,300
So...

255
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,600
U married
your lieutenant, huh?

256
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,800
That was low,
going over my head like that.

257
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,300
Well, i did give you
a week to come around.

258
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,000
Melissa pain--

259
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,500
Student from pacific heights.

260
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,700
Our medical examiner,
claire washburn,

261
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,100
Estimated it took her
16 hours to die.

262
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,300
She was 23 years old.

263
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,800
There were no lilacs,

264
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,300
But he left an old key
in her hand

265
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,100
And a dead mouse at her feet.

266
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,400
When we saw her lips,
we knew it was the same guy.

267
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,500
That's when we dubbed him
"the kiss me not killer."

268
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,200
You gave him
the nickname?

269
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,000
Claire did.

270
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,100
It was...
4:00 in the morning.

271
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,100
None of us
had slept fodays.

272
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,700
You almost sound nostalgic.

273
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,600
Well, back then

274
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
I still thought we were
gonna catch the bastard.

275
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,800
Keep going.

276
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,700
Elaine lewis.
Killed october 12, 2007.

277
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,100
Cashier.

278
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,200
She disappeared
from silver springs, nevada,

279
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,400
Two weeks before
we discovered her body.

280
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Kiss me not eviscerated her,
slit her wrists

281
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,000
And then left r
in a copper bathtub.

282
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
She broke the pattern.

283
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,800
The others were
from the bay area.

284
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,500
Which... you already knew.

285
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,300
You already know
everything in these files.

286
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,200
So why are we doing this?

287
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,300
What i have access to

288
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,900
Are the words
you put down on paper.

289
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,300
<i>What i need is access
to what you were thinking</i>

290
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,200
When you wrote them down.

291
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,500
Was thinking it sucks
that sarah's father

292
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,900
Isn't going to be able
to walk her down the aisle.

293
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,700
I was thinking there's
no mortician on the planet

294
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,500
That could make melissa's
48 stab wounds disappear

295
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,100
So she could have
a decent funeral.

296
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,700
I was thinking elaine
was probably alive

297
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,500
Long enough to watch him
pull out her insides.

298
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,100
Nobody cared about
access to my thinking

299
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,100
When the fbi
yanked this case from me!

300
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,600
So you're pouting?

301
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,200
I don't like you.

302
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,700
I'm not very impressed
with you either.

303
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,900
Damn it.

304
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,200
Ahmed was driving
his cab back from marin

305
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
When he w mia
go over the bridge.

306
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,000
Are you sure it was her?

307
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,900
Unis found her car
in golden gate park.

308
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,500
Purse and i.D. Were inside.

309
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,800
Rescue's looking
for the body.

310
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,900
Mia was either overcome
with grief... or remorse.

311
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,200
I'm gonna take his statement.

312
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,400
So what's up?

313
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,500
I go to get a cup of coffee.
Nexthing i know,

314
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,400
I got captain america
riding shotgun.

315
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,900
It's just routine fbi bull
about the kiss me not killer.

316
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,900
It's nothing.

317
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,500
Hey,
i spoke to miapaulding.

318
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,200
She said she didn't kill
her husband. I believed her.

319
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,000
I don't usually get to know
our victims piecemeal,

320
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,600
But from silas' various parts,
i can tell you he was active.

321
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,600
Didn't have much fat on him.

322
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,300
Still waiting on silas'
business records,

323
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,000
But i just heard through
the uni grapevine

324
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,400
That lindsay is behind
closed doors with some fbi guy.

325
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,800
Routine follow-Up to
the kiss me not investigation.

326
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,100
You're just in time to hear everything you wanted
to know about tires.

327
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,700
According to the techs,
the car that hit silas

328
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,000
Has bias-Ply
instead of radial tires.

329
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,400
So the car was
a vintage something.

330
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,700
My stepdad had
an old muscle car.

331
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,400
<i>He liked to talk
about it a lot.</i>

332
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,400
Is that fbi guy single?

333
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,400
I'm leaving.

334
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,400
Hey, laurent pernet
showed up for his polygraph.

335
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,900
Uh, these,
uh, routine questions

336
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,500
The fbi is asking lindsay,

337
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,100
Just, uh,
how routine are they?

338
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,900
Wait a minute.

339
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,400
She didn't tell you either.

340
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,800
The kiss me not killer
contacted the fbi.

341
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,100
He threatened lindsay.
How long ago?

342
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Over a week.

343
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
Why do you think
he's after you?

344
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,300
I don't think he's after me.

345
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,100
I don't believe you.
I don't care.

346
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,700
(Knock on door)
for the love of god,
come in.

347
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,900
Hi. Heard you were in here.
Hi.

348
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,400
What've you got?

349
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,100
Uh, a friend of ours
who can't exactly

350
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,500
Pass along the information
to jacobi and tom

351
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,700
Came across some information
in the silas spaulding case.

352
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,100
2 years ago, he and his part

353
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,900
After their wine warehouse
was robbed.

354
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,600
Yeah, jacobi and i looked
at the pol

355
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,700
There'nothing there.

356
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,500
Would you still feelhat way
if you knew

357
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,900
Thatix months later,
"oenophile quarterly"

358
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,200
Did a story
about spaulding and pernet

359
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,500
Coming back
from near-Bankruptcy,

360
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,800
Conveniently around
the time of the robbery?

361
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,900
Looks like
an insurance s

362
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,500
Laurent pernet taking a polygraph.

363
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,700
(Woman) have you driven
a vintage car

364
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,300
In the last 24 hours?

365
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,500
No.

366
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,300
Did you kill
silas spaulding?

367
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,200
No.

368
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,200
Did you report a robbery at your
wine warehouse a year ago?

369
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,500
Yes.

370
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,400
Was that report fraudulent?

371
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
No.

372
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,800
W-Why are you asking me
about this?

373
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,600
Just yes or no answers,
please.

374
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,400
Was that police report
fraudulent?

375
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,700
I said it wasn't.

376
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,500
You know what?

377
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,500
You want to ask me
about silas? Fine.

378
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,500
Anything else,
i want my lawyer.

379
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,900
Come with me.

380
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,900
I took a peek at the, uh,
love note the fbi received.

381
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,500
It's a great picture.

382
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,200
Jacobi--

383
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,600
You didn't tell me.

384
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,600
Did you tell anyone?

385
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,500
Did you tell claire, jill,
your reporter friend?

386
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,400
He's a coward. He would
never go toe-To-Toe with me.

387
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,500
Oh. So, uh, you think
you're safe

388
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,800
Because of that gun
on your hip,

389
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,800
Or that extra one
you got strapped

390
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,800
To that skinny little calf.

391
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,500
Oh, yeah,
i know you're packin'.

392
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,100
This psychopath has murdered
three women that we know of.

393
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,800
And he doesn't just do it
in one y.

394
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,600
Oh, no. He uses
all manner of torture.

395
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,600
I'm trained.
I can handle him.

396
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,200
He could shoot you

397
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,500
With a sniper rifle
from across the street.

398
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,600
He could put a bomb
on your car!

399
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,500
He could get into your apartment
and slit martha's throat

400
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,200
And get to you
before you even got a hand

401
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,400
On one of your precious guns!

402
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,800
You want to work yourself
into the ground? Fine.

403
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,300
You want to sit home
every weekend? Fine.

404
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,400
Hell, you want to have sex
with your ex-Husband,

405
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,700
Who happens to be our boss,

406
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,900
And pretend
that it didn't happen? Fine.

407
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,700
<i>I might think
it's sad and stupid,</i>

408
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,000
But that's your business!

409
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,400
But this...

410
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,300
<i>This is my business.</i>

411
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,100
And not just
because i love you.

412
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,700
I could be in that car
he bombs.

413
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,400
I could be standing
next to you on that street.

414
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,300
(Whispers) i'm sorry.

415
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,400
(Sniffles)
jacobi, i'm--I'm--

416
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,400
<i>I don't know
what you think this is...</i>

417
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,600
But it's not partners.

418
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,300
<i>Because partners
are in this together.</i>

419
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,300
And you?

420
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,800
Baby, you just made sure
you in this all by yourself.

421
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,800
Hey. Spaulding and pernet's
business account records finally came in.

422
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,300
You'll notice who they did the majority of ????

423
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,100
??? The aptly named
victor's fine wines.

424
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,300
Mm-Hmm. I know the polygraph
was inconclusive,

425
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,300
But if silas and laurent did run
some sort of insurance scam,

426
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,000
Maybe that wasn't
their only illegal activity.

427
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,300
Victor might know
what they're into.
Maybe he was into it

428
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,800
Let's bring victor in,
get formal.
I'd hold off on that.

429
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,000
You're not working this case.
A woman killed herself,

430
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,300
A woman that i spoke to
this morning.

431
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,500
I'm on the case.

432
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,000
Come on, look how fast
laurent got spooked

433
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,400
When we brought up
the insurance thing.

434
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,100
All right,
we'll hold off on victor

435
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,100
Until we have a better idea
what we're dealing with.

436
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,500
(Knock on door)
where do you want these?

437
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,300
(Jill) great.

438
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,300
The records from spaulding
and pernet are here.

439
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,000
I was expecting... less.

440
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,900
Men, back to my office.

441
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,900
Did you have to tell jacobi?

442
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,400
So i'm thinking that
we should have cindy...

443
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,100
Get on victor.

444
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,400
<i>He did not bring them here.</i>

445
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,400
(Jill) who?

446
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
Elaine lewis' parents.

447
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,000
See if you two
can find anything

448
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,100
In those financial records
that connect it to victor.

449
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,100
Then have cindy head over
to victor's fine wines.

450
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,700
I will call her
when i'm done here.

451
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,600
(Ash) mr. And mrs. Lewis,
part of the reason

452
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,800
I asked you to come in

453
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,400
Is because we have
some new information.

454
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,400
Two days before elaine was
found dead in san francisco,

455
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,100
She was seen in a hotel
off of highway 215.

456
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,000
She was wi

457
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,800
My god.

458
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,800
Is there anything about this
person that you recognize?

459
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,100
Just take your time.

460
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,400
(Voice breaking)
i can't.

461
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,900
You wouldn't think
it was possible,

462
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,100
But it's worse
to see her alive... with him.

463
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
I'm sorry.

464
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,500
(Crying) i have to go.

465
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,800
We're in town
a few more days.

466
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,500
Bringing in
the grieving parents,

467
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,700
Breaking out new evidence--

468
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,900
Do you actually ink
i'm that easily manipulated?

469
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,900
I was hoping you were
that easily manipulated.

470
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,400
You're--
You're gonna want to go.

471
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,700
Because the other option
is that you don't care,

472
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,500
<i>That you never cared,</i>

473
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,700
That your ex upstairs
was right--

474
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,500
You couldn't handle the mess
you made of your marriage,

475
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,200
<i>So you used a serial killer.</i>

476
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,000
You used the pain of those
three women and their families

477
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,900
As an excuse to check out.

478
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,300
And this martyr act of yours
that you've perfected

479
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,900
Is nothing more than
a pathetic facade.

480
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,900
Come with me.

481
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,400
Hi!

482
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,700
Are you victor?

483
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,000
That's me.
Can i help you?

484
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,600
I'm getting married
in a few months,

485
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,100
And i hear

486
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,400
You have some great deals
on some amazing wines.

487
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,700
You heard that from...

488
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,700
Um... i-I think his name
s, uh, digrassi.

489
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,400
<i>Ambassador digrassi.</i>

490
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,100
Well, ambassador digrassi
loves you,

491
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,600
Specifically your prices,

492
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,300
And i'm gonna need a lot of wine
for this wedding,

493
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,300
So i was hoping maybe
you could recommend something.

494
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,500
Well... there's the, um,
2004 château du fey.

495
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,400
Isn't that really
expensive stuff?

496
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,500
Yes, but my brokers
are spaulding and pernet.

497
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,100
They're very connected.

498
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,000
They always get me
the best price.

499
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,600
And this château du fey,

500
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,200
Is--Is that one of their
special acquisitions?

501
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,000
Yes.

502
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,400
I should probably try it
before i decide, huh?

503
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,200
One of those brokers
was also a good friend.

504
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,100
He died today.

505
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,900
In honor of him,

506
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,000
Why don't you take this?

507
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,300
Drink it with your fianc?

508
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,900
If you like it,
i'll give you a good price.

509
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,300
Thank you.

510
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,500
Where we going?

511
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,600
Shut up.

512
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,900
(Lindsay) if i let him...

513
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,300
This bastard's
gonna destroy me.

514
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,900
And that would be okay.

515
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,300
You know, that--
That would be worth it...

516
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,100
If i could stop him.

517
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,100
But i can't.

518
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,500
I tried... for years.

519
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,800
I tried. I gave everything.

520
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,200
I gave up everything.

521
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,600
And i-I failed.

522
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,100
Elaine lewis is dead
because i failed.

523
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,700
So i need you...

524
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,700
To just let me
off the hook here, okay?

525
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,100
I need you to let me
let all of this go.

526
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,400
No.

527
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,800
Laurent's car...

528
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,600
Radials.

529
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,500
Victor's car... radials.

530
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,500
Who else didn't
run over silas?

531
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,900
His wife, god rest her,
his neighbors, his employees.

532
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,300
Nobody has bia
ply tires anymore.

533
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,500
Listen, this fbi guy
the kiss me not case--

534
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,600
Am i the only one concerned

535
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,700
About lindsay jumping back
into this again?

536
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,700
We will all
have to keep our eye on her.

537
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,800
Is that for me?

538
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,100
Yeah, special delivery.

539
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,300
Forensic accounting ferreted out

540
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,800
A hefty mutual fund.

541
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,300
Mia spaulding was saving
for retirement,

542
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,500
But not with her husband.

543
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,400
Some guy named dylan carter.

544
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,800
San francisco police.

545
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,900
Are you dylan carter?

546
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,400
Uh, no. Hang on. Dylan!

547
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Hey, honey. What is it?

548
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,500
Uh, this is dylan, my wife.

549
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,600
Sorry, honey.
This will only take a sec.

550
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,700
Mia spaulding isn't dead,

551
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,400
But she is dylan carter.

552
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,800
Yeah, i bet you wish you were back on that honeymoon, huh?
Mm.

553
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,100
I, um... i told tony that

554
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,300
I witnessed a hit-And-Run,

555
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,800
And you're here to
take a statement.

556
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,400
Please.
I didn't do anything.

557
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,900
You faked your own death.

558
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And you're a bigamist.

559
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,200
I didn't kill silas.

560
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
This is where i was.

561
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,500
Call anyone on that list.

562
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,800
I go to every p.T.A. Meeting.
I'm in charge of cookies.

563
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,900
I'll make the calls.

564
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,300
Why did you want us
to think you were dead?

565
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,300
I was dead.

566
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,200
That me--Mia spaulding

567
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,700
Doesn't exist without silas.

568
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,100
I just--I wanted to end it

569
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,300
Before things got
even more complicated, and...

570
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,900
And i had to get home.

571
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,500
To your other husband.

572
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,900
I paid that cab driver $500
to say he saw me jump.

573
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,100
I have been a better wife
to tony,

574
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,800
A better mother to my boys

575
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,500
In the three years i was married to silas

576
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
Than i ever was before.

577
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,300
I'm  happy.
I...

578
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I was happy.

579
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,300
But sila..
Checks out.

580
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
We--We met
at a-A gallery opening..

581
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,100
And i went by myself,

582
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,800
'Cause tony, he doesn't like
that kind of a thing.

583
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,600
And silas just swept me away.

584
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
So i told him i was single...

585
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,600
And the lies just spiraled.

586
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,200
Must've been tough to keep track
of who you were, when.

587
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,300
I had two cell phones
and two sets of i.D.S,

588
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,400
But neither of them
ever suspected.

589
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,700
Are...

590
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,500
Are you... are you gonna
arrest me for all this?

591
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,700
That'll be up to the d.A.

592
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,600
Thank god. Youthful eyes.

593
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,200
All right, tell me
if these numbers match up.

594
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,900
What am i lookin' at?

595
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,700
On a hunch, lindsay wanted me
to do a comparison

596
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,800
Of the wine we found
with silas spaulding's body

597
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,900
With a sample of the same wine
straight from the winery.

598
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,600
Lindsay thinks
that silas and laurent

599
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,500
Were counterfeiting wines?

600
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,400
It's a possibility.

601
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,900
Well, for once lindsay's hunch
didn't pan out.

602
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Numbers match up.

603
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,100
But... let's try this one.

604
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,600
Victor gave me this bottle.

605
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,200
It's from silas and laurent.

606
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,100
Will do.

607
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,500
You are so helpful.

608
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,000
So mia spaulding
is not dead?

609
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,800
Hi. Two things--

610
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,900
You're supposed to call claire
about wine counterfeiting.

611
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,100
I'm working a hunch

612
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,800
Because i am on this case.

613
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,200
Okay.

614
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,500
And here's your warrant

615
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,000
For a storage facility
in oakland.

616
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,000
It's rented by a company
owned by a company

617
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,400
Owned by laurent pernet.

618
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,300
And there's
a third thing... for you...

619
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,400
In the bathroom.

620
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,900
Go ahead. We got this.

621
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,800
Give me two seconds.

622
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,800
What?
This better be important.

623
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,900
Heather? It's lindsay.

624
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,500
Lindsay  boxer.

625
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,100
Um...

626
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Can i come in?

627
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,800
Yeah, i guess so.

628
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Hi.

629
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,100
Lindsay boxer's a great me.

630
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,600
I'm gonna be heather hogan.

631
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,500
Heather hogan's
not... bad.

632
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,800
It's ridiculous.
Heather hogan.

633
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,100
Heather hogan from hoboken.

634
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,800
Well, when you
say it like that...

635
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,300
That's how tom's mother
says it.

636
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,700
Tom's mother says everything

637
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,500
In the most vile
and offensive way possible.

638
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,300
It's just part of her charm.

639
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,500
Every time i go to turn
these stupid papers in,

640
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,800
I-I freak out.
I don't know.

641
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,700
I've been down there
and back three times today.

642
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,900
Well, i'm sure tom doesn't mind
if you don't change your name.

643
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,300
He says he doesn't
but

644
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,700
He does

645
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,600
Yeah.

646
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,500
Okay.

647
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,500
Okay

648
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,900
I've been working
this case.

649
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,000
This woman had
two different names,

650
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,200
Two different husbands,
two different lives.

651
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,400
But when it comes down to it,

652
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,700
She's just one messed-Up chick.

653
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,300
She could have 50 names,
and she would still be

654
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Just one messed-Up chick
who doesn't know who she is

655
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,100
Or what she wants.

656
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,200
But you...

657
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,300
Whatever your name is...

658
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,700
You have a husband
who loves you

659
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,500
And a job that you love.

660
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,800
So your last name...

661
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,300
It's just the way
we sign our checks.

662
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,400
And who uses checks anymore,
anyway?

663
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,200
Here.

664
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,900
Ready?

665
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,100
Any bets on what's in there?

666
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,000
Yeah, i wouldn't mind a case
of '45 latour.

667
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,100
Or the murder weapon.

668
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,700
Whoo! I just drove
a ferrari.

669
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,100
Yeah, 4 feet.

670
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,500
All but three of these cars
have bias-Ply tires,

671
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,800
But none have
major body damage.

672
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,200
Our murder weapon is here,
right?

673
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,300
You a lab tech now?

674
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,500
I am whatever i need to be,

675
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,600
And the real techs wanted me
to look at this particular car

676
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,100
Because there is
organic matter in the grille.

677
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,100
Organic matter as in blood.

678
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,600
Blood, hair, skin,
plus some body damage.

679
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,200
Hello, murder weapon.

680
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,400
Congratulations.

681
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,200
Okay, you could have waited
for me.

682
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,500
You come here alone?
Where's agent ash?

683
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,300
I snuck out the back
and came all by myself

684
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,600
Because i'm not 6.

685
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,500
Inspector boxer,
you should check out that 750i.

686
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,000
I think
it's been tampered with.

687
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,800
Hey, he's worried about you.

688
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,400
Sometimes worry and anger
look a lot alike.

689
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,200
Well, he wants me to hide
and be scared,

690
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,400
And i can't do that.

691
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm not gonna give him
the satiaction.

692
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm assuming
you're talking about the, uh,

693
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,800
Kiss me not killer,
not tom.

694
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,300
Both, actually.

695
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,700
You should tell your friends.

696
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,000
Do you have a flashlight?

697
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,500
Thank you.

698
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,100
You see that?

699
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,300
Somebody tried to hot-Wire
this baby.

700
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,700
I think our killer tried
and couldn't get it started.

701
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,000
The new models are notoriously
difficult to hot-Wire.

702
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,500
So he moves on
to the vintage s.U.V.

703
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,700
It's easier to wire,
and, frankly,

704
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,700
Probably better suited

705
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,200
For repeatedly
running somebody over.

706
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,100
Meaning laurent's
probably not our killer.

707
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,000
I mean, why hot-Wire
your own car?

708
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,400
Yeah, so somebody
breaks in here,

709
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,800
Takes one of laurent's cars,
kills silas,

710
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,400
Then puts it back
exactly where he found it

711
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,400
With out a good washing.

712
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,500
Laurent's being framed.

713
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,800
Who benefits
from killing one partner

714
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,300
And sending
the other partner to jail?

715
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,700
Actually, i have
a thought on that.

716
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,200
Victor atkinson,
it's san francisco p.D.!

717
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,200
Fire in the hole!

718
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,200
Okay, blow it!

719
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,800
Atkinson,
we know you're in here!

720
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,900
He's got about $1,000 worth
of château lafite in him.

721
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,100
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

722
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:37,900
He's armed.

723
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Tom!

724
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,300
Tom!

725
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,300
Oh, thank god.

726
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,200
Don't tell heather.

727
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,200
Mr. Atkinson,

728
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,300
You do not
want to shoot a cop!

729
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,700
Let's talk!

730
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,900
I can't go to jail.
I will not.

731
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,200
Stay down! Don't move,

732
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,500
Or i will tell heather.

733
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,500
Put it down, right now.

734
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,700
Put it down.

735
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,200
You better be drunk,
shooting at a cop.

736
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,500
How did you know?

737
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,100
That bride you met with today?

738
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,600
We tested the wine you gave her.

739
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,300
It wasn't e real
château du fey.

740
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:07,800
Was counterfeit.

741
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,900
Silas and laurent
no,

742
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,400
Not silas and laurent.

743
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,900
I just saw all of your empty
bottles and your fake labels.

744
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,600
Silas found out you were selling
counterfeit wine, didn't he?

745
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,500
But because you were
his father's friend,

746
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,300
He didn't even tell laurent.

747
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
He wanted you to have a chance
to make it right.

748
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,400
Make what right?

749
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,200
It's no difference
to most people

750
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,300
What's in the bottle

751
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,600
As long as the label is right.

752
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,800
And those rare few
who realize they've been had,

753
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,400
They don't want to admit
they spent $1,000

754
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,400
For a $100 bottle
of wine, right?

755
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,700
I told silas i wasn't
going to apologize.

756
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,900
When his business with laurent

757
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Was in trouble
a couple of years ago,

758
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,000
Know who saved them? Me.

759
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,700
I hired a guy to rob them

760
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,900
So they could collect
the insurance money.

761
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,300
He owed me.

762
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,100
Why frame laurent?

763
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,400
It had to be somebody.

764
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,700
Did silas know that you
were behind the robbery?

765
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,500
Not until two days ago,
when he threatened

766
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,900
To go to the police
about counterfeiting.

767
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,400
How dare he?

768
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,600
Okay, let's go.

769
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,900
I have
an announcement to make!

770
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,800
I would like to introduce
all of you

771
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,100
To mrs. Heather hogan.

772
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,800
Great.

773
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,100
Now that is a great name.

774
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,000
Congratulations.

775
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,300
You know, she didn't want
to change her name,

776
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,600
But she'll never
tell him that.

777
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,700
Most people don't really
want to know the truth.

778
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
No... most people
want the fairy tale.

779
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,300
I did.

780
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,900
I wanted prince charming
to love me

781
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
No matter who i was,

782
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,400
No matter what i did.

783
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,700
Doesn't work that way,
does it?

784
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,900
Oh, my god.

785
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,600
Oh, my god.
I know why he does it.

786
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,000
Kiss me not?

787
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:14,500
Come on.

788
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,300
Tell me you found your
grandmother's antique books?

789
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,400
Yeah, come on in.

790
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,400
Hi.

791
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,400
So what are we
lookin' for again?

792
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,400
Okay, the key elements
of the kiss me not murders--

793
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,400
Okay? Elaine lewis--
Copper tub, silver leaves.

794
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,700
Sarah rice--
Silver rope, lilacs.

795
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,600
Melissa paquin--
A key and a mouse.

796
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,300
So you think
he's staging these murders

797
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,900
Based on old fairy tales?

798
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,300
These fairy tales have been told
for hundreds of years

799
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
In hundreds of different forms.

800
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,600
They're, uh,
archetypal, allegorical.

801
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,900
Morality tales tt center

802
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,800
Around transgression,punishment, redemption.

803
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,600
Yeah, all--All of that,

804
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,200
But i also think he's doing
the prince charming thing.

805
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,000
Kiss me not thinks he's the prince charming?

806
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,300
No. I don't know.

807
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,500
But i do know that if we're
gonna understa this guy,

808
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,900
We have to understand
the stories

809
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,100
That he's trying to tell.

810
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,900
I'm in.Thanks for calling me.

811
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,900
You're in the club,
after all.

812
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,100
You have a club, huh?

813
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:05,800
No.

814
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I'll see you in the car.

815
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,100
I think agent ash

816
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,100
Wants me to tell you

817
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,400
That he didn't just pull me
back in this case

818
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,000
Because of my stellar
investigative skills.

819
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,500
What do you mean?

820
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,000
Lindsay?

821
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,100
Uh...

822
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,100
The killer sent
the fbi something--

823
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,200
Uh, an article of yours,
actually--

824
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,100
With a photo

825
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,600
From elaine lewis'
crime scene...

826
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,000
Uh, of me...

827
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,800
With xs all over my lips.

828
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,500
Oh, my god.

829
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,500
And you didn't tell us this?

830
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,600
I didn't want anyone
to worry.

831
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,800
You don't get to decide that.

832
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,800
We're your friends.
How could you not
tell us abt that?

833
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,700
I know, but--
Hey, hey, hey,hey, hey, hey!

834
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,600
I know you think
we gave up last time,

835
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,300
That we left you
to fight him alone.

836
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,900
You were right.

837
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,400
We couldn't handle it.
We screwed up.

838
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,700
We were wrong.

839
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,100
But we are back.
We are with you.

840
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,900
We are gonna catch
this son of a bitch.

841
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,200
Nothing is gonna happen
to you.

842
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,700
Are we clear?

843
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,200
We're clear.

844
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,800
