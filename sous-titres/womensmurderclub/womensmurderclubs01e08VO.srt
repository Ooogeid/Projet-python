1
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,570
Bleary eyes...

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,060
greenish
complexion,double-fisting coffee...

3
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,360
you want to tell me
what you did last night?

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,090
Dinner with friends.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,970
I know about tom's bachelor party.

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,420
Rumor has it you were
behaving like firemen.

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:26,130
I enjoyed a black and blue
porterhouse,a 30-year-old whiskey.

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,270
It was verging on sedate

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,460
heather has no idea what she's in for.

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,100
Tom's a pain in the ass.

11
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:32,950
He's stubborn.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,790
He never admits when he's wrong.

13
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,120
nivaldo quiroga,father of the deceased.

14
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,240
Twgunshot wounds to the chest.

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,510
Is he gonna make it?

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,130
I'd put a 20 on "not a chance in hell."

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,190
Crime scene's on the third floor.

18
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,120
I'd call that a forced
entry. Where's the body?

19
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,810
Javier quiroga. 17 years old.

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,530
Two bullets to the upper
torso,one to the thigh.

21
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,250
What a way to start a weekend.

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,060
Barely old enough to shave.

23
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,610
"El mejor padre del mundo."

24
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,770
World's best father.

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,090
Maybe the world's best father
and his son had a disagreement.

26
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,990
Family feuds do tend toward the bloody.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,910
Maybe it was a robbery,

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,220
but it doesn't look like
there was much to steal.

29
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,430
Well,one man's trash...

30
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,190
gang-related?

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,320
We're in the right territory.

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,260
Did you get anything from the neighbo?

33
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,840
Just the usual "no habla
inglÈs" wall of silence.

34
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,160
You ever think how much easier our
job would be without the illegals?

35
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,890
Your family come over on
the "mayflower," officer han?

36
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,590
747,working papers in hand.

37
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,840
you in the ceiling,this is san
francisco police department.

38
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,720
We know you are in there.

39
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,770
Hi,baby.

40
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,840
Hi,sweetie.

41
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,040
It's okay. It's okay.Don't be afraid.

45
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,260
Thank you very much.

46
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,110
Okay,the doctor said the bullet
nicked his pulmonary artery,

47
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,160
but she disay the surgery went well.

48
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,630
I was gonna say he's a lucky man,

49
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,860
but waking up to identify
your son's killer,

50
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,950
well,that's not exactly the lottery.

51
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,700
You know,he may not even
remember what happened.

52
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,450
He did manage to save his
daughter. That's something.

53
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,460
I officially hate this weekend.

54
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,250
Ms. Perez.

55
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,830
I'm the social worker
assigned to this case.

56
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,490
How's she doing?

57
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,550
Physically,she's fine.

58
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,020
Emotionally,she's traumatized.

59
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,750
Being surrounded by
strangers doesn't help.

60
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,930
We believe her father and brother hid her
in the ceiling when they heard the intruders.

61
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,120
Has she said anything about that?

62
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,810
She's not talkG... at all.

63
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,340
Wouldn't even tell me her name.

64
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,860
uh,isela quiroga,according
to the building super.

65
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,550
she's our only witness.

66
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,710
She needs to feel safe.

67
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,390
Right now she just doesn'T.

68
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,170
hey,tom,it's me.

69
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,330
I need your fiancÈE.

70
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,490
you called heather?

71
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,870
I told tom to call heather.

72
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,550
I recognized the school
logo on isela's backpack,

73
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,420
and then I remembered that isela was one
of the kids that showed up to heather's

74
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,270
"bring your kindergarten class to
lindsay's ex-husband's work" day.

75
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,320
Calling heather...

76
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,880
kind of places you at the
top of the evolutionary scale.

77
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,170
So true.

78
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,700
But then tom said that heather said
that she had to make a stop on the way.

79
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,620
Really? What,is she
getting,like,a mani-pedi?

80
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,250
You know their wedding is
really close--like,days.

81
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,500
And I am very happy
for the both of them.

82
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,530
Have I not been clear?

83
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,830
Tom and me,it's--it's
all good.

84
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,250
No worries. What have you got?

85
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,830
Because I am in desperate
need of a solid theory.

86
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,940
I looked into the quirogas.

87
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,620
There's no record of domestic disputes.

88
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,640
No records period,including social
security mbers,credit scores.

89
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,680
Javier had an assignment card from
the san francisco day larers program.

90
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,960
They were in the U.S.Illegally.

91
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,800
Legal or not,this kid was a hard worker.

92
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,330
Fingernails are embedded
with drywall dust--

93
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,080
paint specks on his
skin and in his hair.

94
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,020
Probably been in construction
since he was knee-high.

95
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,960
There are a few day laborer pickup
spots in javier's neighborhood.

96
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,900
I can ask around,see if
anyone knows anything.

97
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,350
Absolutely not.

98
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,300
Do you speak spanish?

99
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,490
Yes,a little,and there is no way that

100
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,940
you're gonna go running
around in random groups of men,

101
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,460
alone and unarmed,and asking
questions about a murderer.

102
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,020
Don't! That's a protection bracelet.

103
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,600
Uh,brujas sell them to ward off
negative energy and evil forces.

104
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,840
But it didn't protect javier.

105
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,250
brujas and witches. Really?

106
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,900
You're gonna talk to us about
witches and keep a straight face?

107
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,430
They're not witches in the black
magic/ halloween sort of way.

108
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,070
You used the words "evil
forces," and you crossed yourself.

109
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,280
You know,they're also marriage
counselors,matchmakers,healers.

110
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,730
They are con artists,but that does explain
the amateur stitches on javier's head.

111
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,430
Now that's commitment.

112
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,530
I think I found my theory.

113
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,750
I think our victim javier quiroga
was a member of the cincos.

114
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,630
He had a big "5" tattoo on his chest.

115
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,780
Hello to you,too.

116
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,200
Listen,I need you to t me
in touch with hex escamila.

117
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,510
He took over the cincos
like what,three years ago?

118
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,440
- Hex escamila?
- Yeah.

119
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,710
The only way that you would know about my gang
contacts is if you read my task force reports.

120
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,740
You keeping track of me?

121
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,240
How's isela?

122
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,160
Uh,she still hasn't talked.

123
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,370
She's in my office with a social worker.

124
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,620
Her mom died when isela was born,

125
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,710
so javier and nivaldo
are her whole world...

126
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,620
especially since they
came to the states.

127
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,550
You brought a bunny.

128
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,650
Oh,'s the stop I had to make.

129
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,060
- Snickers...
- "snickers."

130
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,650
The class pet. I thought
it'd help her open up.

131
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,910
It's a great idea.

132
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,220
Okay. Come on.

133
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,650
Snickers was so sad today.

134
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,370
Couldn't get him to eat.

135
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,090
I think he missed you.

136
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,400
Think you could help him out?

137
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,440
Isela,you remember
inspector boxer,right?

138
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,530
You met her when the
class came to visit.

139
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,080
Inspector boxer really
wants to help your father.

140
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,230
Where's papi?

141
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,230
The doctors are taking care of
him, but he needs your help,too.

142
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,600
So can you do that?

143
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,910
Would you talk to
inspector boxer for me?

144
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,920
Hi,isela.

145
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,990
You know what? You can call me lindsay.

146
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,430
Well,thank you. Thank you.

147
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,750
Do you like bunnies?

148
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,730
Do you like dogs? Yeah?

149
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,730
I have a dog. Her name is martha.

150
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,960
You know what?

151
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,760
Martha helps me when I get scared,too,

152
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,450
just like snickers is helping you.

153
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,380
I'm gonna stay with isela until,

154
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,340
- well,as long as she needs me.
- Okay.

155
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,950
D.C.F.S.Has a playroom upstairs.

156
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,420
But I'll see you later.

157
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,350
You were always good with witnesses.

158
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:58,240
Well,this time snickers gets
the credit... and heather.

159
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,880
What did isela say?

160
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,720
She remembers sounds,mostly--
um,the door breaking down,

161
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,730
her father and javier racing around
in the dark,pulling her out of bed--

162
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,970
but she didn't see anything?

163
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,920
No,and she has no idea
what the intruders wanted.

164
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,170
She did say that they
spoke "funny spanish."

165
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,670
So maybe they weren't native speakers.

166
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,190
- Okay.
- Okay.

167
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,070
Come on,let's go. I'm driving.

168
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,520
Where are you driving to?

169
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,660
- I got a bead on our gang leader hex.
- Okay.

170
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,090
- I'll grab jacobi.
- No,no,no.

171
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,350
No,he's still at the hospital. Come on.

172
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,770
Hex is not gonna talk to you without me.

173
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,000
All right? Come on.

174
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,190
It'll be an adventure.

175
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,430
tom hogan is back on the streets.

176
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,440
Tom hogan is on the move.

177
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,340
Tom hogan is talking in third
person,and it's scaring me.

178
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,950
Okay,so if javier's
murder was a gang hit,

179
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,720
this could mean e end of the truce
between the western addition gangs.

180
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,860
Which could mean a war,which could mean
bodies piling up faster than we can tag 'em.

181
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,740
That's a lot of boxes.

182
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,560
Wedding stuff.

183
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,680
- Listen,linz,when we talk to hex--
- why are your wedding programs bumpy?

184
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,810
seeds.

185
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,560
Yeah,we're having a green
wedding,so after the reception,

186
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,110
our guests can plant the
programs,grow flowers.

187
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,830
That's,uh...

188
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,590
really responsible,really thought out.

189
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,110
You didn't think things
out at our wedding.

190
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,340
Says the woman who suggested
pizza for our reception.

191
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,610

Listen,linz--

192
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,560
oh,look,judging by
the tattoos,we're here.

193
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,140
hex?

194
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,600
- Nice suit.
- Yeah.

195
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,340
Haven't seen you in
the streets for a while.

196
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,690
Lieutenant now. Homicide.

197
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,300
I need your help with a case.

198
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,690
I'm inspector lindsay boxer.

199
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,810
Um,do you know a kid
named javier quiroga?

200
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,010
You can help me out with this case,

201
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,340
or I can flood your neighborhood
with black and whites,

202
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,970
remind you that we're
not actually friends.

203
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,340
Inside. Your bitch stays here.

204
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,780
I'll be right back. The important
thing is we keep the case moving.

205
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,380
Jacobi is such a better partner.

206
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,100
Hi there! Excuse me.

207
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,040
Uh,I'm looking for javier quiroga.

208
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,420
Javier? He's not here.

209
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,660
What can we do for you?

210
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,970
Well,the backsplash in
my kitchen is half tiled,

211
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,700
and,ugh,the guy who was
doing it disappeared on me.

212
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,690
I'm having a dinner
party tomorrow night,

213
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,300
and javier did some wonderful
work on my bathroom last spring.

214
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,190
We'll get you someone else.

215
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,610
No,the thing is,it has to be javier.

216
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,430
These guys don't exactly punch a clock.

217
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,700
You know what? I think I'll just wait.

218
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,210
could you guys get me a soda?

219
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:32,260
and I think I might have to use your
phone. Cell reception out here is for crap.

220
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,630
You what?

221
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,190
øQuiÈn ha visto a javier?

222
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,970
no s?

223
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,970
let us get you somebody else.

224
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,910
I mean,you don't want to deal with
a hothead like javier anyway,right?

225
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,250
javier was sweet.

226
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,140
Yeah,sweeenough.

227
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,950
He went after another guy in the
middle of my site for stealin' his girl.

228
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,250
We bounced 'em both.

229
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,440
Who did he go after?

230
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,850
A kid named jay bird.

231
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,730
Why,you want him to do your backsplash?

232
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,050
You know,I think I'm gonna
cancel the dinner party.

233
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,270
Thank you.

234
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,770
Okay,the situation was
completely not dangerous.

235
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,800
Anyway,javier got into it with
a guy named jay bird over a girl.

236
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,590
Okay,me telling you to stay out
of this was not a suggestion.

237
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,060
There are 14 jay birds
in the system. Of course.

238
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,710
I need to call you back.
I am not done yelling.

239
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,340
yes.

240
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,660
Tom's phone.

241
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,370
- Lindsay?
- Yeah,hi.

242
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:49,450
Uh,tom is not here,but,um,I-I
saw that it was you,and,uh...

243
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,580
did isela remember something else?

244
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,010
Oh,um,not--not
yet. Where's "here"?

245
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,720
Uh,in a deserted alley.
We're chasing down a lead.

246
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,750
Well,tom is. I'm waiting in the car.

247
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,260
Really? That's interesting.

248
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,520
Um,okay. Uh,this is sort of weird.

249
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,210
Uh,since tom isn't there,can
I ask you to do me a favor?

250
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,210
Okay,um,we got...

251
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,470
a bunch of birdseed,uh,a
lot of unopened gifts.

252
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,610
This one looks like a blender.

253
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,270
It's a yellow piece of
paper with handwriting on it.

254
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,030
Yeah,entrÈe--free-range
organic chicken,got it.

255
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,900
I know in the scheme of things...

256
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,110
- where's cezar?
- This is really,really unimportant.

257
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,610
What,you too important to talk to me?

258
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,190
I'm a cop.

259
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,170
Yeah,and last month
it was the meter maid.

260
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,080
You're probably that ex-girlfriend
of his,won't take a hint,right?

261
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,840
It's just that if the printer
doesn't get the menus by 4:00 today,

262
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,320
- he can't guarantee they'll be finished.
- Is this another one of your skeezers,cezar?

263
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,770
- So you want tom to drop it off?
- 'Cause I will teach her a lesson.

264
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,730
I will whup her ass,show
her I mean business!

265
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,830
- Yeah,if it's not too much trouble.
- Hell,no.Don't you turn your back on me,bitch.

266
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,760
- Hey,come on.
- Cezar!

267
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,880
what the...

268
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,690
Heather,I have to go.

269
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,380
the gun was hers.The drugs are his.

270
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,140
Take 'em in. I'll do
the paperwork later.

271
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,150
What did I miss?

272
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,310
Well, these two have
serious communication issues.

273
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,680
Cezar, in addition to sleeping with
his ex,is a complete "buster"...

274
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,770
According to the munchkin.

275
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,760
Are you... I leave you for five minutes.

276
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,950
I come back to, uh, guns, blood
and a full-blown domestic dispute?

277
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,270
What d hex say?

278
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,280
The truce is still on,
and javier wasn't a cinco.

279
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,290
Well, what about the tattoo?

280
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,240
I don't know. Maybe the
kids A... a banger wannabe.

281
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,050
Did you get anything
besides your black belt?

282
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,380
Yes, actually.

283
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:52,810
I got a call th javier went at it with
a guy named jay bird over some girl.

284
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,660
So you want to take me
back? I'll grab jacobi, and--

285
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,960
what are you talkin'
about? We're on a roll.

286
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,430
- Really?
- Yeah.

287
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,590
Okay. Oh, I almost forgot.

288
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,610
Heather called, and you need
to drop off the menu cards.

289
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,330
mr. Quiroga,I'm inspector warren
jacobi,san francisco police department.

290
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,930
Where are my children?

291
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,500
Your daughter's fine.

292
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,790
She's with her teacher--ms.
Donnelly. She knows you're awake.

293
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,750
She'll be here any minute.

294
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,360
My son?

295
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,510
What about my son?

296
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,950
I'm sorry,sir.

297
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,250
Javier was killed last
night when you were attacked.

298
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,300
I know this is hard,but I need
to ask you a few questions.

299
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,910
isela!

300
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,130
Papi!

301
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,530
Mi angelito.

302
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:55,250
Isela,be careful. Your
father's still hurt.

303
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,270
No.

304
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,450
It is just what I need.

305
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,640
Heather's not what I expected.

306
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,000
And what did you expect?

307
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,790
I don't know. Fangs?

308
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,590
Nadia delashummt,department of
immigration and customs enforcement.

309
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,300
Jill bernhardt,deputy D.A.

310
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,610
So we got a report that illegal
immigrants were involved in a crime.

311
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,900
Not involved--victims. Nivaldo quiroga
was shot,and his son javier was murdered.

312
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,580
We never pursued anything
concerning his immigration status.

313
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,360
One of the unis at the
scene filed a report.

314
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:38,100
One of the unis at my crime scene?

315
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,720
The directive of "operation return
to origin" is pretty clear,inspector--

316
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,600
uniformed officers are strongly encouraged
to report possible illegal immigrants to ice.

317
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,780
Illegal status or not,he's a
witness in a murder investigation.

318
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,520
And allowances will be made for that.

319
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:53,270
Great,because I've heard of
cases where illegal immigrants

320
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,000
who were witnesses to
crimes have been deported,

321
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,510
the red tape becomes a nightmare.

322
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,160
Prosecutions have fallen
completely apart because of it.

323
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:02,500
That's rare,but I would suggest
moving his case along quickly.

324
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,770
You'll want to depose him while
he still at the detention center.

325
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,940
Excuse me.

326
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,320
That immigration officer
sounds a lot like your boss,

327
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,240
who totally hates me,by the way.

328
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,570
Oh,denise hates everyone.

329
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,400
well,at the moment,denise is far
more concerned with the fact that

330
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,490
nivaldo clammed up before jacobi
even had a chance to question him.

331
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,950
We don't know if he
doesn't remember anything,

332
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,120
or if the sight of our friendly
immigration agent scared him into silence.

333
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,070
Where's lindsay?

334
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,190
with jacobi,I assume.

335
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,080
Since she's not
here,let's talk about her.

336
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:41,490
I booked a whole slew of treatmes athe
transcendence spa for the day of tom's wedding.

337
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,670
Distraction. Good plan.

338
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,250
I'm in.

339
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,300
Okay,who wants to hear about
the contents of javier's stomach?

340
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,760
You are not going to tom's wedding?

341
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,080
Okay,I have to go.

342
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,700
Ed's tom's friend,and ed wants to
go,and ed never wants to go anywhere.

343
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,990
I'm a horrible person,right?

344
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,450
You're not a horrible
person. You're a good wife.

345
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,230
I have to tell her. I mean,I do,right?

346
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,970
You have to tell her.

347
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,020
This is one event that makes me very happy
to not be a founding member of the club.

348
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,020
Ooh,I'm a horrible person.

349
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,380
- Oh,tell us about the stomach contents.
- Thank you.

350
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:18,170
Okay,javier drank a cocktail of smilax,
turnera aphrodisiaca and larix decidua.

351
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,860
Some sort of herbal remedy?

352
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:24,670
Or a potion-- like,say,something
that you would get from a bruja.

353
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,760
And it is of any interest to you,

354
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:31,350
I tracked the dragonfly charm on javier's
protection bracelet to a bruja on guerrero street.

355
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,110
We know about this witch how?

356
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,210
Because I have secret
sources all over town.

357
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,990
And we hope to gain what?

358
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,410
What,you'd rather go back to
searching for jay bird number six?

359
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,700
- can I help you?
- Yeah.

360
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,000
Uh,we're lookin' for the witch.

361
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,610
Ah,you mean the bruja.

362
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,520
That would be my mother corazÛN.

363
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,430
You know,you don't have to believe
in her gift, but you should resct it.

364
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,240
You should respect that we're
cops investigating a murder.

365
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,450
Of course.

366
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,000
Follow me.

367
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,160
Thank you.

368
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,300
May I ask that you prepare yourself
before entering my mother's presence?

369
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:39,530
would you...

370
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,080
I mean,do you really think
people believe in this stuff?

371
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,830
Superstition lps bring
order out of chaos.

372
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,680
Is that you talking,or heather?

373
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,210
I'm an ever-evolving being.

374
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,340
You
are a--

375
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,450
how can I help you?

376
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,960
- I'm inspector lindsay boxer.
- This is tom hogan.

377
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,010
Lieutenant tom hogan. Lieutenant.

378
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,530
We're investigating the
murder of javier quiroga.

379
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,740
He was wearing one of your
bracelets when he died.

380
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,760
I do not speak of my clients.

381
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,350
Clients?

382
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,860
You're a witch,right?

383
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,920
I am a healer.

384
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:20,360
People trust me to keep the secrets
of their hearts locked inside of mine.

385
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,870
Do you think your staff would be interested in knowing
there's an immigration officer buzzing around today?

386
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,400
Now when was the last
time you saw javier?

387
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,510
A few days ago.

388
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,210
He wanted a potion to win
the return of his beloved.

389
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,160
This is all very lovely and metaphoric,

390
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,020
but we need to know
about javier's beloved.

391
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,320
Marisol.

392
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,310
You can find her at
the 24th street bakery.

393
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,870
Great. Anything else?

394
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,060
Yes.

395
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,390
A marriage will end soon.

396
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,440
you're a little late.

397
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,260
Uh,thank you,though,

398
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,880
and we'll be back if we
have any more questions.

399
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,340
Detective?

400
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,600
Yes?

401
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,960
You will need this.

402
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:12,480
This is all the protection I need.

403
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,120
I meant it for your heart.

404
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,130
Let's go over this one more time.

405
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,550
Nivaldo's your neighbor,his
son javier is killed,

406
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,570
and you still don't know anything?

407
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,770
I keep telling you.

408
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,230
I didn't see nothing.

409
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,060
Nobody saw nothing.

410
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,080
Fine. Come on,let's go.

411
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,760
More wall of silence?

412
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,630
Been interviewing
neighbors for three hours.

413
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,730
Now somebody in that building knows
something that will spin us the right way,

414
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,680
- but nobody's sharing.
- All right.

415
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,510
I took a closer look at
javier's protection bracelet,

416
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,390
and there's a few strands of
human hair woven into the twine.

417
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,310
I find myself incapable
of not saying yuck.

418
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,950
Unfortunately no roots,so no D.N.A.

419
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,920
But it is colored--one of
those,like,drugstore reds.

420
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,350
Maybe javier had a girlfriend.

421
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,290
Eh,he does.

422
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,580
Lindsay and tom are tracking her down.

423
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,440
Lindsay and tom...

424
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,130
on the streets together?

425
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,020
Okay,this is not good.

426
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,560
I have people
I need--

427
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,110
You know this is not good.

428
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,190
You're her partner.

429
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,520
And tom's my boss.

430
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,000
Officially,they're on police business.

431
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,410
Unofficially,this whole
thing is none of my business.

432
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,480
You know.

433
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,380
I don't know anything.

434
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,870
You know they slept together.

435
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,660
And you let her run off with him?

436
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,820
- They're on a case.
- We are the only ones that know.

437
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,270
We have to,like,do something,like,

438
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,720
you know,have an
intervention or--

439
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,880
claire.

440
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,870
If I knew something,I'd say
whatever it is with lindsay and tom,

441
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,770
the only people who can figure
it out is lindsay and tom.

442
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,720
So you're going to the
wedding,assuming there's a wedding?

443
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:54,310
Uh,there's a wedding,and yes,I am going.

444
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,570
Welcome back.

445
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,740
Let's hit it.

446
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,930
- you sure you don't want me in there?
- Oh,no.We got this.

447
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:11,020
You don't get to look
at her like that anymore.

448
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,050
so,marisol,no one
told you he was killed?

449
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,110
javier had the same bracelet on.

450
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,300
Who did he need protection
from,you or jay bird?

451
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:22,560
me and javier got bracelets
to protect our hearts.

452
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,160
so why did you leave him?

453
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,780
All he did was work.

454
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,010
That's why you left him for another guy?

455
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,150
I didn't leave javier for no other guy.

456
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:35,110
Him and his father just-- all they wanted to
do was work all the time and save up money.

457
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,170
They hadike $5,000
stashed in their apartment.

458
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,260
That's a nice windfall.

459
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,220
You and jay bird could have
had some real fun on that money.

460
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,250
He didn't even know about it.

461
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,570
Javier swore me to secrecy.
That money was for his sister.

462
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,700
- Isela?
- No.

463
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,920
Pilar-- the
one in mexico.

464
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,850
She's older than isela.

465
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,140
Look,that money was sacred.

466
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:58,100
It was for the coyotes to
bring her over the border.

467
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,790
It'sunny how we didn find any
money in javier's apartment,

468
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,390
and now jay bird is M.I.A.

469
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,970
He's in juvie. He's
been there almost a week.

470
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,460
Okay,what about the tattoo?

471
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:10,380
We know javier wasn't a cinco,but
he had their brand on his chest.

472
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,460
Look,that wasn't for a gang.

473
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,370
It was for his family.

474
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,580
He got it right after his
mom died to remind him that,

475
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:21,470
even with her gone,there will
always be the five of them--

476
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,350
javier,pilar,isela
and their mom and dad.

477
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,210
Maybe tom can get the chief
toxert some pressure...

478
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,960
if we can find him.

479
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,240
- you made a promise!
- yeah...

480
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,400
- Looks like tom's in a little trouble.
- You said you wouldn't be on the streets anymore.

481
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,020
I-I think we should go.

482
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,070
Stop.

483
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,840
You promised me once we were married...

484
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,980
mistake number one--she left
herself open for a technicality.

485
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,580
Technically,we are not married yet.

486
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,120
- Bingo.
- Are you out of your mind?

487
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,930
- Here comes the diversion.He's gonna use the job.
- No,we're talking about a gang-related homicide.

488
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,760
I can't not do my job,especially when
my involvement in the case is crucial.

489
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,950
He's such a liar. He was not crucial.

490
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,720
I don't want to be the woman who
sits at home by the phone hoping that

491
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,060
her cop husband comes home
at the end of the night.

492
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,470
You promised that wasn't gonna
happen,and then you go out,

493
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,060
and you chase some gang
member with lindsay.

494
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,610
- And he'll totally ignore my name...
- come on.

495
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,930
And then reassure her that
nothing will ever go wrong.

496
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,560
I didn't do anything dangerous.

497
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,230
I swear to you.

498
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,340
Are you freaking out about the
wedding? Is that what's going on?

499
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,890
Nice--larger relationship qstion
in the middle of a big fight.

500
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,080
He'll dodge it with a physical gesture.

501
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,440
- Do I know this guy or what?
- You were wrong,tom.

502
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,190
I need you to say you were wrong.

503
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,000
Never gonna happen.

504
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,260
It's never gonna happen.

505
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,650
Okay.

506
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,470
I was wrong.

507
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:51,040
I broke a promise to you,and I'm sorry.

508
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,940
Thank you.

509
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,760
nivaldo's gone.

510
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,560
He disappeared from the hospital.

511
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,220
nadia is going to ruin me.

512
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,480
She's gonna put me on some
homeland security no-fly list.

513
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,520
We cannot tell her
nivaldo is on the run.

514
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,340
Oh,she'll figure it out once he's
found dead in a ditch somewhere.

515
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,200
According to his doctor,he
could go septic within hours.

516
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,920
Okay. Nivaldo wakes up.

517
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:30,850
His son is dead.

518
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,060
There's an ice agent standing
over his bed,waiting to deport him.

519
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,260
I'd run,too.

520
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,630
Question is,to where?

521
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,920
Our friendly ice agent just requested our
case files,only it wasn't so much a request.

522
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,020
She knows?

523
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,120
Empty hospital bed was a tip-off.

524
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,540
She also wants isela.

525
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,630
Why does she want isela?

526
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,670
Leverage on nivaldo.

527
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,070
If he wants his daughter,he's
gonna have to turn himself in.

528
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,170
Well,he's not gonna live that
long if we don't get to him first.

529
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,660
Where the hell did he go?

530
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,660
Morgue.Now

531
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,720
okay,apparently I have
to go down to the morgue.

532
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,800
I have to go break the news to denise.

533
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,550
It was a pleasure knowing you both.

534
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,120
I know that look. I don't like it.

535
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,540
Nivaldo quiroga fled the hospital,

536
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,840
and the ice ent nadia wants
to take his little girl.

537
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:16,840
This just gets better.

538
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,790
I thought maybe you could take her on.

539
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,400
That reporter cindy
thomas is all over this.

540
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:24,220
You play this right,think
of the headlines...

541
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:30,010
"acting district attorney files an injunction against
homeland security to reunite a father and daughter."

542
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,630
You think you know me so well,don't you?

543
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,120
Well,I'm gonna help you
anyway. I'll talk to her.

544
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,230
- Thanks,denise.
- Don't bother.

545
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,930
This is rivero.

546
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,130
I heard the "be on the lookout"
for nivaldo on my police scanner,

547
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,420
so I started
thinkin'--

548
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:48,040
where do illegal immigrants go when
they're on the run from the police?

549
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,990
Sanctuary churches. The unis are on it.

550
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,340
But unis,as in guys in uniform,

551
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,660
as in not the folks that
these folks are gonna talk to.

552
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,610
Granted,they don't really
talk to reporters either,

553
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,180
which is why it's lucky I have cultivated
some contacts in the mission district.

554
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,400
One of them told me about rivero.

555
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,570
Is that a gunshot wound?

556
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,300
It's through and through.

557
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:09,150
He'll survive,but I'm sure
it hurts like hell. Come on.

558
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,180
The nuns at st. Mary's
were trying to treat him.

559
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:17,060
He refused to go to a hospital because
hospitals report gunshot wounds.

560
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,110
And we know how that works.

561
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,600
So I told him I had some friends who
could help without going to the police.

562
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,370
I'm the police.

563
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,030
yeah,I-I know,but yeah,not really,so...

564
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,420
yeah,really.

565
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,210
Let's start with how he got shot.

566
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:33,000
a few days ago,two guys
wearing masks,gloves,

567
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,900
the whole scary robber bit,broke
into rivero's apartment on payday,

568
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,790
and when he fought
back,bullet to the rib cage.

569
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
Sound familiar?

570
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,580
Does he know the men who shot him?

571
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,110
No idea,but they knew he had cash.

572
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,810
Chico hunters.

573
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,110
Excuse me?

574
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,550
Chico hunters. They're strong-arm
robbers who target illegal immigrants.

575
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,050
I've heard of cases in
L.A.And in miami,but--

576
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,020
they target people they
know won't go to the police.

577
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,330
That's despicable.

578
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,610
The hunters know their
victims are getting paid,right?

579
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,490
Ask him if he's ever worked
for encinal bay builders.

580
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:17,970
There were two guys--
the construction foremen.

581
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:22,010
Okay,so they pay their
workers end of the day.

582
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,720
Then they wait until
they get their money.

583
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,170
And then they put on masks and
get the money back at gunpoint,

584
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,040
and whatever else their
victims have managed to save up.

585
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,260
That's a nice way to turn a profit.

586
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,600
The foremen-- how
was their spanish?

587
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:37,390
Uh,it was kind of not-native.

588
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,730
Isela said the robbers spoke
funny spanish. I gotta go.

589
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,300
- what the hell is going on in here?
- NothinG.

590
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,730
You don't see him,okay?

591
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,330
- He's just here enjoying fine medical care.
- Okay.

592
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,330
I need to see you now.

593
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,980
This better be good.

594
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,080
What do you got?

595
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:12,920
Right here to me,or we're leaving.

596
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,020
Dude came through my neighborhood
a couple of hours ago.

597
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,750
He was lookin' for a gun.

598
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,360
Why do you think it's our guy?

599
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:25,210
He had blood on his shirt,and he
was wearing a hospital bracelet.

600
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,250
Sounds like nivaldo.

601
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,350
He's not running.

602
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:35,570
He knows who killed javier.
He's out to avenge his son.

603
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,210
uÁnivaldo has a gun.

604
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,460
He is out on the streets
looking for you right now.

605
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,170
Tell us what you know about nivaldo.

606
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,360
I know I had nothing
to do with any robbery.

607
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,240
Good.

608
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,920
Then you won't mind reading
this out loud for me.

609
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,530
Bring her in.

610
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,550
Hi,sweetie.

611
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,440
Ready?

612
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,490
Okay.

613
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,480
Go ahead.

614
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,210
Dame tu dinero.

615
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,730
dime donde est* su dinero.

616
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:27,290
Have you heard those voices before?

617
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,200
Isela,are you sure?

618
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,520
We just need you to tell the truth.

619
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,610
It's all right if you're not sure.

620
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,160
I don't know.

621
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,590
That's okay,sweetie. You did a good job.

622
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,190
Come on.

623
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,010
Big jump. There you go.

624
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,990
Hi,isela. My name is nadia.

625
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,810
What's going on?

626
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,970
We're taking custody.

627
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,290
When her father is found,she
can rejoin him in mexico.

628
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,580
- Can she do this?
- No.

629
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,260
You can't just come in
here and grab a little girl.

630
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:09,440
It's better that all the adults in
the room keep their voices modulated.

631
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,090
We want to make this transition
as easy as possible for isela.

632
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,380
Let's go,isela.

633
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,780
I tried.

634
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,600
God,that woman is a bitch.

635
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,340
So isela may recognize their voices.

636
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,600
She may not recognize their voices.

637
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,810
Which means I can't even
get you a search warrant.

638
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,760
Meanwhile,nivaldo is out there
somewhere,possibly septic,

639
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:58,680
with a gun,and unlike
us,he knows who he's after.

640
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,070
Plus side-- he can't
be moving very fast.

641
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,990
He's in pain. Ice is looking for him.

642
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,250
Have I mentioned how
much I hate this weekend?

643
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,780
And what is that stench?

644
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,900
Trash can.

645
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:11,420
Someone must have tried to treat
rivero's wound with a homemade poultice.

646
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,660
Yeah,it's stinky.

647
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:15,720
Didn't you say that brujas
sometimes serve as herbalists?

648
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,610
Yeah. You're thinking encinal
bay builders wasn't the only link

649
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,730
between javier,nivaldo and rivero.

650
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,140
A bruja has clients throughout
the immigrant community.

651
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:26,420
People tell her their secrets--
personal and financial.

652
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:31,480
She could have known that javier and
nivaldo had $5,000 saved for the coyotes.

653
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:35,000
So what,a 60-year-old witch is the
jesse james of the mission district?

654
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,930
Think about it. She gets secret
information from her clients,

655
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,350
passes it on to her sons and then
sits back while they do the dirty work.

656
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,710
Oh,I think it's time I gave this
bruja's crystal ball a shake.

657
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,970
there's a crazy guy in there!

658
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:05,910
put 'em down!

659
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,570
- Drop the guns!
- put 'em down right now!

660
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,790
My mom! He's got my mom!

661
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,730
- Put the gun down!
- Put it down!

662
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,770
Back away from it.

663
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,150
nivaldo.

664
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,950
Please,I swear I had
nothing to do with this.

665
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,830
Put the gun down,nivaldo.

666
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,010
She killed my son!

667
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,400
No,I didn'T.

668
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:32,910
I didn't know anything about it.

669
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,290
She's the only one I
told about the money.

670
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,000
I bought a charm to make the money grow.

671
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,340
She knew it was for pilar,to
bring her from mexico.

672
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,220
You don't want to do this,man.

673
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,970
I trusted her!

674
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,940
She has to pay for what
happened to javier,senor!

675
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,550
Your daughters trust you.

676
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,060
They trust you to do
what's best for them.

677
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,490
If you kill her,you will lose isela.

678
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,770
You will lose both of your daughters.

679
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,620
They need you,nivaldo.

680
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,590
There will be no justice
in your system for my son.

681
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:05,010
I have to do it myself
before they send me away.

682
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,270
Put that gun down,

683
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,260
and I promise you I will not let immigration
take you or your daughter anywhere. All right?

684
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,390
And you let me worry about the justice.

685
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,260
Come on.

686
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,880
Thank you. Gracias.

687
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,320
You saved my life.

688
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,660
Once I get a search warrant in here,

689
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,440
I don't know how much
of a life it's gonna be,

690
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:43,340
but I hear protection bracelets
are all the rage at chowchilla.

691
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,980
- isela!
- Papi!

692
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,930
I make a million promises
when people are holding guns.

693
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,650
I'd like to keep this one.

694
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,350
Let me give it a try.

695
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,340
So you got the guys that killed javier.

696
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,200
Yeah.

697
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:26,540
We,uh,found a stash of stolen
goods in their storage unit

698
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:31,620
and a list of financial information
in the bruja's handwriting with,

699
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,590
nivaldo and rivero and
several other targets,so...

700
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,100
yeah,it's over.

701
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,250
Thanks.

702
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:45,860
Listen,um,about tom being
out on the street earlier...

703
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,300
That--that's
my fault.

704
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:50,810
I-I needed his help with a gang
connection thing,and I'm sorry.

705
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,380
Lindsay,I think you and i both
know that's not true,but...

706
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:57,150
I appreciate that you said it.

707
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,850
Okay.

708
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,530
See ya.

709
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,180
Still mad at me?

710
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,930
I think I got,like,three days
worth of grudge still left in me.

711
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,800
I like her.

712
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,650
Yeah.

713
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:33,650
So,um,delashummt. Is it...haitian?

714
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,580
Tout ko mwen cho.

715
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,210
Your whole body is hot

716
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,690
it'S...it's the only creole I know.

717
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,530
My family's originally
from the dominican republic,

718
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:49,750
and so you and I,we share the
same island,if different histories.

719
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,040
The dominican?

720
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:53,480
First generation american. You?

721
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,260
So,nadia,I know what it's like.

722
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:02,100
As a homicide inspector,people
hate seeing you coming.

723
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,350
Most of my days are spent being lied to.

724
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,560
I learned early on not to
get personally involved.

725
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,860
Well,that's easier for some than others.

726
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,720
Well,my first time in the field,

727
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:16,860
I found a family of six dead in a
storage container in 120-degree heat.

728
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,370
When we pulled the bodies out,

729
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,860
one little girl,4 years
old,was barely hanging on.

730
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,960
I visited her in the
hospital every single day.

731
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,710
Did she make it?

732
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,610
No.

733
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,280
I,uh,guess we got lucky this time.

734
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,200
SometimeS... in special cases...

735
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:52,610
amnesty can be granted to illegal immigrants who
aid in the conviction of criminal enterprises.

736
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:59,690
If that's true,I ow a great late-night
mom-and-pop spot over in noe valley.

737
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,330
They serve a nice chivo picante.

738
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,420
Might remind us of the island.

739
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:10,530
Plus,uh,we can talk about maybe you pulling
some strings to get nivaldo's daughter a visa.

740
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,210
Oh,you're smooth.

741
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,930
Well,you know...

742
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,930
I could try calling her again.

743
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,820
No,if she wanted to come,she'd be here.

744
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:21,060
Is there something going
on that I should know about?

745
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,360
Lindsay spent half the day
driving around with tom.

746
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,440
Lieutenant tom?

747
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:27,290
As in "ex-husband,soon
to be remarried" tom?

748
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,900
Heads up.Heads up.Heads up.

749
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:34,930
Did I miss something?

750
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,740
We're just tking about jacobi and
his date with nadia,the ice princess.

751
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,180
He's way too sexy for her.

752
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,170
Is that just me?

753
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,520
First...

754
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,550
Second,you were totally
talking about me.

755
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,910
We were worried about you,that
you might be disturbed.

756
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,440
After your
antics with tom--

757
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,640
you two out on the streets
together,blood pumping--

758
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:59,440
we were solving a
murder,and if you must know--

759
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:03,510
as in,you decided to tell him how you really
feel and begged him to call off the wedding?

760
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:07,920
I've read between a lot of
lines these last few weeks.

761
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,070
No,as in...

762
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,480
I finally figured out why
tom took the lieutenant job,

763
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,850
and it--it wasn't
to be closer to me.

764
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:24,170
Heather didn't want to have to worry
about him being out on the streets.

765
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:28,050
So,you know,he-- he
settled down behind a desk.

766
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,960
And that can't be easy for him.

767
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:34,890
You know,but he did it anyway...

768
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:38,100
because she ked him to.

769
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,250
And--and he--he
loves her.

770
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:49,430
Well,clearly he's whipped.

771
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,820
actually,he's kind of great.

772
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:58,390
They're--they're
great... together.

773
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,340
So...

774
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:06,560
it turns out tom's not so bad
at being in a relationship,

775
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,810
which means he isn't the problem...

776
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,100
or he wasn'T.

777
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,410
I-I was the problem.

778
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:20,230
Well,if it makes you feel any better,

779
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:24,720
I want to be just like
you when I grow up.

780
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:30,370
oh,and I know you're
going to tom's wedding.

781
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,420
I saw his guest list in the car.

782
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,490
I was gonna tell you.

783
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,390
She was so not gonna tell you.

784
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,800
There's been a lot of
freaking out on the subject.

785
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,030
Wait. Jacobi's going,too.

786
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,660
oh,maybe he'll bring nadia.

787
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,390
Now i am disturbeD.
