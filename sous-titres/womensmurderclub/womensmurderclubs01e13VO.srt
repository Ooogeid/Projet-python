00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,400
9-1-1 emergency.
San francisco 9-1-1.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,000
9-1-1 emergency.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
He's trying to kill me. Please hurry!

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,900
Ma'am, can you go outside?

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,800
He's in the living room!
Please hurry!

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,600
Ma'am, listen to me. The police are on theiray right now.

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,400
He's in the hall!

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,700
Ma'am, go into another room, lock yourself in
and try to leave out the back door.

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,800
Oh, my god!
He's going to kill me!

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,300
He's breaking down the door!

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,500
Ma'am? Ma'am?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,700
Hey.

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,800
Sorry to inrrupt pete's going away dinner.

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,000
You got me before it started.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,200
You hear the 9-1-1 call?

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,600
No woman is here, and that
was definitely a woman's voice.

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,900
That's definitely a man.

18
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,500
Fred osner, 35.
Wallet was in his back pocket.

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,000
He lived two houses down.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,900
So the caller's a woman.
She gives this address.

21
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,000
<i>The patrol guards show up
and find only him?</i>

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,900
The caller identified herself
as corinne stevens.

23
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,200
She lives here. Neighbor says
her husband's away on business.

24
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,500
Two head wounds-

25
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,100
Blunt object and then
he starts in with a knife.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,100
This guy's butchered.

27
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,300
18 stab wounds and counting.

28
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,100
Is that a crystal rabbit?

29
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,400
The killer picked it up
and smashed it into his skull.

30
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,100
That's an enraged killer.

31
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,100
Enraged like
a jealous husband?

32
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,000
Are there any drag marks around?

33
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,300
No.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,400
So he took corinne with him.

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,600
Why am i here?

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,300
What-What-What is this place?

37
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,800
I don't understand.
Why are you doing this?

38
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,000
Why won't you talk?!

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,800
Please. Please.
Talk to me!

40
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,900
Why are you doing this?!

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,900

42
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,100
She's been missing ten hours.

43
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,300
What is this, kidnapping?

44
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,800
Off-The-Record?

45
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,200
Linz, it has been so long since we were
on-The-Record,i've put the record away.

46
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,100
Ten
hours and no ransom demand.

47
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,000
Where's the husband?

48
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,400
He was at a hotel in colorado springs.

49
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,400
He checked out at midnight
the night before last.

50
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,900
If he drives fast enough,
just makes it in time.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,800
We tried to reach him on his
cell, but it's not turned on.

52
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,400
So corinne gets home and turns
the alarm system off at 8:02 p.M.

53
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,600
And the victim, fred osner,
did he come in with corinne?

54
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,900
Yeah, it looks that way.

55
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,300
Our guess-
The killer's waiting inside.

56
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,100
He sees fred. They struggle.

57
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,600
Corinne runs for t media room
and locks the door.

58
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,700
That's where the call
came from.

59
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,300
The killer drops fred with this
crystal rabbit then stabs him.

60
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,100
Fred's watch is smashed
at 8:11 p.M.

61
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,200
8:12 p.M., corinne calls 9-1-1
from the media room.

62
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,400
You're supposed to be home recuperating
it was a gunshot after all.

63
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
I'm recuperated.

64
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,400
How do you know where corinne
s when she called 9-1-1?

65
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,600
The doorknob-He snapped it when he forced his way in.

66
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,300
So what happened with pete last night?

67
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,200
I got the page at the restaurant
before we even sat down.

68
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,800
That's okay.
I got two days before he leaves.

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,600
Hey, linz.
I just brought in the husband.

70
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,900
Are you people nuts?

71
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,800
Why would i kidnap
own wife?

72
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,400
You have a temper.
Your wife's having an affair.

73
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,000
With fred? He's our friend.

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
He checks on corinne
when i'm away. I asked him to.

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,300
Look, i stopped in reno
on the way back, and i slept.

76
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,800
Talk to the hotel staff.
I- I left my cell phone there.

77
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,100
We're looking into it. .

78
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,800
Stevens, we're checking out the crystal rabbit
the killer used to hit fred.

79
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,600
If we find one fingerprint-

80
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,100
What? Wh-What did he use?

81
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,200
The killer picked up a crystal
rabbit and hit mr. Osner in the head.

82
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,300
We don't own any crystal rabbit.

83
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,000
Excuse me a moment.

84
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,500
<i>Look,
i know what you're thinking.</i>

85
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,900
She's 25, a trophy wife.

86
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,200
I didn't do this.

87
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,400
Can you think of anyone
who might have a grudge against you?

88
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,500
Anyone your wife mentioned?

89
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,300
No.

90
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,200
I don't-I don't know.
I... no. No one.

91
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,300
You have to find corinne.

92
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,600
Please.

93
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,300
A minute?

94
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,900
His alibi checks out.
He did sleep in reno.

95
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,700
Now forensics found
no prints on the rabbit-

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,600
Not the husband, the victim
or the missing woman.

97
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,100
So the killer must have
brought it with him.

98
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,900
Who brings a crystal figurine
to a kidnapping?

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,700
Maybe it was a, i don't know,
a message to the husband.

100
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,500
He was weang gloves.

101
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,300
There was no fingerprints.

102
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,300
That's not a message to the husband.
That's a message to us.

103
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,500

104
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Your victim
has two head wounds-

105
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,000
One from the glass rabbit,

106
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,400
The other, i think, came
om the killer's right shoe.

107
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
He kicked osner postmortem.

108
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,100
This is from the second wound.

109
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,600
There's something
in the matted hair.

110
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,200
I think it's blue paint.
I sent samples to the lab.

111
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,400
What kind of knife did he use?

112
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,600
Serrated. And he's strong.
He stabs with tremendous force.

113
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,900
Is there a small indentation
at the bottom of every wound,

114
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,500
Like from the base of the knife
slamming against his skin?

115
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,000
Maybe, but how could you...

116
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,400
You think
it's the kiss me not killer.

117
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,300
Lindsay,
his only victims were women.

118
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,100
And he took corinne stevens with him.

119
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,700
Linz,
all three women had their lips sewn together,

120
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,400
Not him. Osner wasn't
his intended victim.

121
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,000
It was corinne he wanted,
and fred osner interrupted him.

122
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
And the crystal rabbit?

123
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,400
Well,
look at all the other crime scenes-

124
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,700
The-The mouse, the tub,
the-The key, the lilacs-

125
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,600
All symbols
of some sort of ritual,

126
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,300
And the crystal rabbit
was another one.

127
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,900
He meant it
for corinne stevens,

128
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,100
But he broke it
when he killed fred osner.

129
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,600
He's back. He's killing again,
and he's got his next victim.

130
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,600
I didn't hear you come in.

131
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,100
I was just taking
a quick shower.

132
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,900
I'm sorry
i didn't come home last night.

133
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,800
Yeah, well, martha and i
spent some quality time.

134
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,300
Really?

135
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,300
Yeah. And now that you're here,
maybe we can have some.

136
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,800
You have no idea
how good that sounds,

137
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,900
But i have
to get back to work.

138
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,900
Yeah. S-Sure.
No, i understand.

139
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,400
You know, work's work.

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,100
Assuming that that's
what this is all about.

141
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,000
You think i'm running away
because you're leaving.

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,800
I think you're running away
'cause i'm leaving.

143
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,600
Pete, believe me,
that's not it.

144
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,100
Is this something
i can ask you about?

145
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,400
We call him
the kiss me not killer.

146
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,200
He started five years ago.

147
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,800
He tortures women
and sews their lips shut.

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,400
Am i totally
freaking you out?

149
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,300
No, no. No, you're not.

150
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,000
Hunting this guy
took over my life.

151
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,400
I became obsessed.

152
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,700
I lost my marriage.

153
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,800
I lost perspective
on everything.

154
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,900
Why this one?
Why-Why bring this one home?

155
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,800
<i>If i knew
why he chose these women...</i>

156
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,100
If i could figure that out,

157
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,900
Then i could understand him.

158
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,900
I have to finish this.

159
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,400
It's the only way that
i can get him out of my life.

160
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,200
He's taken another woman,
pete,

161
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,700
And i have to find him
before he kills her.

162
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,000
You have to go.

163
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,800
Do what you have to do.
Just go.

164
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,200
Crime scene is clean
xcept for the paint residue in the hair.

165
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,100
Why in the hair
and not on the carpet?

166
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,700
Well, okay, look.
You see these threads?

167
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,400
Lab says that they're stitches
that hold the upper tohe sole of the shoe.

168
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,800
The paint was held in by
the threads. Lieutenant?

169
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
Yeah.
Here you go.

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,800
Thank you.

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,900
So you
kicked him in the head...

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,200
Lost your temper.

173
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,800
Stupid.

174
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,200
Stare at that board long enough,
you'll see a sailboat.

175
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,800
Hey, wheeler.

176
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,600
Hey. So the lab says
the paint from the killer's shoe is called skylar blue.

177
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
It's a specialty paint,

178
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,300
Uh, used for restoring old
cars and trucks.

179
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,000
How old?

180
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,400
We're talking, uh, elvis and hula hoops.

181
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,000
Five dealers in the bay area carry it.

182
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,400
Three of them
don't have it in stock.

183
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,900
The fourth one just got his first shipment
in six months.

184
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,900
You said five dealers.

185
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,300
No, the fifth one
has it in stock.

186
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,500
His name is, uh, john harris.

187
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,500
Let's go.

188
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,300
Skylar blue.

189
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,200
Uh, well, not much call
for it unless you own a '55 pickup.

190
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,000
Was it only used in 1955?

191
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,900
June '55 to april '58.

192
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,200
People
got tired of the dark blue.

193
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,600
This one's sort of a turquoise/robin's egg,
and then people got tired of that.

194
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,600
Americans and their cars.
We're picky.

195
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,800
Have you sold any recently?
Yeah, i can check.

196
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
How good are your records?

197
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,100
Oh, well, at $290 a gallon,
it's not exactly walkinout the door.

198
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,300
We're not talking a lot of people.

199
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,500
Well, please give us a list and add, uh, your employees
and day laborers for the last five years.

200
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,100
I'll fax it over right away.

201
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,400
No, we'll wait for it now.

202
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:51,900
This is serious.

203
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,000
Where were you last night around 8:00,
mr. Harris?

204
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,500
Well, gee. I was here.

205
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,000
We're open till 9:00. I have the
surveillance tapes.

206
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Great. We'll take those
and the list of customers and employees.

207
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,700
Right away.

208
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,600
Hey. Still no sign
of corinne stevens.

209
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,900
We recanvassed
the neighborhood.

210
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
What about the paint dealers?

211
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Jacobi and wheeler are running the customers
and the employees through n.C.I.C. So far nothing.

212
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,100
Hey, linz.

213
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,200
John harris, the paint dealer
we saw this morning?

214
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,900
He had a 15-Year-Old daughter.
She ran away 16 years ago.

215
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,800
Disappeared. A lot of cops
worked on the case on and off,

216
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,700
Especially after
they found her dead.

217
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,800
One of the cops was your dad.

218
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,700
Where'd they find her body?

219
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,000
It was five years ago.

220
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,500
Her remains were dug up
in a park near san mateo.

221
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,600
I need a minute.
It's about a case.

222
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,200
Must be pretty big for you
to come see the old man.

223
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,100
We speak twice
in the last seven years,

224
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,800
And suddenly
i'm your new best friend.

225
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,000
Can i come in?

226
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,800
Always welcome here.

227
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,900
You, uh, want some tea?

228
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,300
I got that scottish brunch stuff
you like. Um...

229
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,400
Scottish breakfast,
and you hate it.

230
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,600
But i stocked up on it.

231
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,700
I figured eventually, you'd come
to visit.

232
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,800
This isn't a visit.

233
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,900
If that's the way you want
to play it. What's the case?

234
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,100
It's a serial killer
i've been working a few years.

235
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,100
Kiss me not?

236
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,300
Is there
a new victim? I didn't hear.

237
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,000
We were trying
to keep it quiet.

238
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,000
He took a woman last night.
Hopefully, she's still alive.

239
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,300
What can i do for you?

240
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,000
John harris, auto paint dealer,
his daughter ran away.

241
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,200
Does that ring any bells?

242
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,500
Harris.

243
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,800
Oh, yeah.

244
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Daughter's name was rachel,
right?

245
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,300
Yeah, i worked that case
a couple of weeks.

246
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,100
You were homicide, so why'd you
work it if she was a runaway?

247
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,900
<i>The family said she was
a runway, but nobody bought it.</i>

248
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,600
Didn't take any clothes, didn't
tell anybody she was leaving.

249
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,000
We expected
to find her body any day.

250
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,400
Only about a decade off.

251
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,700
Who were you
looking at for the killer?

252
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,700
A couple of us liked
the harris' son.

253
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,900
Billy.

254
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,300
Yeah.
He was in the file.

255
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,700
12 years old, strange kid.

256
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,900
Of course, harris and his wife didn't
want to hear it.

257
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,200
But could a boy that age kill a 15-Year-Old girl
and dispose of the body?

258
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,600
I've seen worse. We kept an eye on him.

259
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,900
He got into some fights,
in and out of juvie.

260
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,900
The kid
always just seemed wrong.

261
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,500
Jacobi.

262
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,300
Hey. What do you got
on billy harris?

263
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,100
Uh, he works
in his father's shop.

264
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,900
You know, harris didn't have him
on the employees list.

265
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,200
Shift manager says he's been
out sick for three days.

266
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,300
He works in his father's shop.
Ask jacobi where-

267
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,300
I know what to ask jacobi.
Whe does he-

268
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,200
He lives in his father's house.
Don't get snippy over the phone.

269
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,400
Get a warrant,
text me the address,
and i'll meet you there.

270
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,600
I gotta go.

271
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,000
Anything else i can do?

272
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,300
No, uh, i just came
for the information. Thanks.

273
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,300
Sure, kid. Hey.

274
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,400
Be careful.

275
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,500
Always am.

276
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,900
I don't understand.
Why are you looking for billy?

277
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,300
What is this about?
Take mr. Harris outta here.

278
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,600
This isn't right. This is
my house. Get him outta here!

279
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,000
Lindsay, nothing in the
basement. D.M.V. Report.

280
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,800
Billy harris has got
a 1956 f-100 pickup, color blue.

281
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,800
Thanks.

282
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,800
The layout of this room
look familiar?

283
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,600
This was the daughter's room
a long time ago,

284
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,500
Just like in the file photos.
Mm-Hmm.

285
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,900
No sign of corinne stevens
in this house.

286
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,700
No blue pickup truck
in the garage.

287
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,800
Thanks.

288
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,600
It's not here
because he's driving it.

289
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,800
<i>You are gonna
tell me about sarah rice.</i>

290
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,700
<i>She was laid
to rest in a bed of lilacs.</i>

291
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,200
<i>They were still fresh
when we found her. Why?</i>

292
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,100
<i>Well, he leaves things
at crime scenes, like a key.</i>

293
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,500
<i>Melissa paquin-
48 stab wounds.</i>

294
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,800
<i>He left an old key in her hand
and a dead mouse at her feet.</i>

295
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,500
<i>When we saw her lips,
we knew it was the same guy.</i>

296
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,600
<i>Elaine lewis-</i>

297
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,200
<i>She was eviscerated
and left in a copper bathtub.</i>

298
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,800
<i>Is that a crystal rabbit?</i>

299
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,400
<i>Who were you
looking at for the killer?</i>

300
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,300
<i>A couple
of us liked the harris' son,</i>

301
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,800
<i>Strange kid.</i>

302
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,800
Jacobi!

303
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,300
The crystal rabbit, the lilacs,
the brass tub-

304
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,700
All of these things
belonged to rachel harris when she was 15.

305
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,500
Billy harris
is the kiss me not killer.

306
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,700
How much longer do we have,
and will he keep corinne alive?

307
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,800
He kept sarah rice alive
six days.

308
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,700
I know a shrink in juvie
where billy spent time.

309
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,800
I just talked to him.

310
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,500
Now he can't tell you anything-
Doctor/patient privilege-

311
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,200
But he's my friend.
I know this guy. He'll help us.

312
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,500
Cindy, this isn't your job.
You can get in a lot of trouble.

313
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,900
That's half the fun.

314
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,700
I don't know where billy is.

315
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,800
Do know
that he's a good kid.

316
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,100
Your list of employees-
You didn't put billy on it.

317
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,300
I don't think of billy
as an employee. He's my son.

318
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,500
This is a nightmare.

319
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,500
Linz?

320
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,800
If harris knew
what billy was doing,

321
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,100
He didn't do it with him.

322
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,500
We pulled his credit cards.

323
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
The night
sarah rice disappeared,

324
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,300
He was in atlanta
at a car show.

325
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,200
Thanks.

326
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,000
Sure.

327
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,800
Billy goes hunting
and doesn't tell you where?

328
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,700
Maybe. I wasn't listening.
He likes to hunt.

329
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,000
I don't even know how to fire a
gun.

330
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,500
Might any of his friends know?

331
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,800
No, he's, uh...

332
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
He's sort of a loner.

333
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,000
When your daughter rachel disappeared,

334
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,600
We understand
that the police told you
they thought
billy might have done it.

335
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,600
Yeah. Yeah, and when they said
that to my wife, it killed her.

336
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,200
She died two months later.

337
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,900
Mr. Harris, we understand the feeling of needing
to protect your son,but there is a woman's life at stake.

338
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,000
Please think about
what you're doing.

339
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,500
He knows where billy is.

340
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,700
I don't know.

341
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,800
He jumped out of
his chair when i brought up rachel.

342
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,000
You don't think
he's protecting billy?

343
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,300
No, he's not.
Harris isn't protecting his son.

344
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,800
He's protecting himself.

345
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,200
Rachel harris was buried
in a vinyl duffel,

346
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,500
Handles on the side,
dried blood on it.

347
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,800
Didn't they test the blood?
Too small a sample at the time.

348
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:13,100
I had them compare the d.N.A. From the blood speck
to the d.N.A. Om billy harris' hair brush.

349
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,500
It's a partial match.

350
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,500
It's his father's blood.

351
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,800
So john harris killed and buried his daughter
and then claimed she ran away?

352
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,800
We can charge harris, offer him
a plea to help us find his son.

353
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,400
Okay, let's get him charged,

354
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,200
But if this guy's smart as i think he is,

355
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,600
He isn't gonna help us
with anything.

356
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,800
Boxer, homicide.

357
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,100
Hello, lindsay.

358
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,700
Yeah. Who's this?

359
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,100
Let my father go if yont
to keep corinne alive.

360
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,800
Billy?

361
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,200
You want to help corinne,
right?

362
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,700
Uh, yes. Yes, i do.

363
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,900
Uh, let me talk to her.

364
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,900
No games. Let my father go.

365
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,100
Damn it!

366
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,500
Not enough time
to trace the call.

367
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,800
What'd he say? Linz?

368
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,700
Uh, uh, he said that if we
didn't let john go, he would kill corinne.

369
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,400
I got here
as fast as i could.

370
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,500
I'm sorry. I probably sounded a little...

371
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,700
Freaked out when i called.

372
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,300
So you're sure
it's billy harris?

373
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,300
Yeah.
But you know what, claire?

374
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,300
It was partly a relief.

375
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,600
Okay.

376
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,500
Well, billy harris
has always been this phantom.

377
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,800
Now i know what he looks like,
i know what he sounds like.

378
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,200
I took pete
up to the attic this morning and showed him...

379
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,000
Crazy lindsay's
serial killer exhibit.

380
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,900
What happened?

381
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,800
He had
a bunch of questions.

382
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,100
I don't know
if he'll get past it.

383
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,400
???

384
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,300
It's a little early to be
talking about love.

385
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,600
Lindsay, he sleeps at your place
when he's not in a hotel,

386
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,000
He cooks, he walks your dog,

387
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,300
He puts up with your crazy hours
and never complains.

388
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,300
That's not love?

389
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,500
That would be amazing...

390
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,700
If i wasn't spending his last day here
living inside billy harris' head.

391
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,700
Which is what we all rely on you to do,
and i'm sure pete understands that.

392
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,300
Cindy called.

393
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,900
She said she has something
we'll want to see.

394
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,300
I have billy's notebks
from juvie hall.

395
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,200
My friend said he could lose his license,
so he needs them back when we're done.

396
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,000
Look at this. It's from 1993.

397
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,700
He was thinking about it
even as a kid.

398
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,100
A serial killer at age 12?
But he wasn't killing anyone.

399
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,700
This w in the back
of his notebook.

400
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,700
And here's the freaky thing-
The first drawing shows up

401
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,200
Two weeks
after rachel disappeared.

402
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,500
Why would he draw her like that
if he didn't know she was dead yet?

403
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,700
Unless he did.

404
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,800
That's what the drawings mean.

405
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,700
John harris killed rachel,
and billy saw it happen.

406
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,500
He knew his sister was dead.

407
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,900
He draws her
with her lips sewn shut.

408
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,000
That's how a 12 year old
tells us what happened.

409
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's about keeng the secret.
It's about the silence.

410
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,600
John must have threatened billy
and told him to keep quiet about it.

411
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,100
Why these women, billy?
Why do you choose them?

412
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,500
All this time...

413
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,300
All this time, it's been
right here in front of me.

414
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,100
Where?

415
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Look at corinne
stevens and her husband,

416
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,500
And then look
at the past three victims.

417
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,200
Each victim is a young woman
with an older man in her life-

418
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,800
Sarah rice had the boyfriend,

419
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,500
Melissa paquin-Her sick fathe

420
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,400
Elaine lewis
and the older boss.

421
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,600
It's all about rachel.

422
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,900
With each victim, billy is
reenacting his father's crime

423
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,100
And the order not to tell.

424
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,500
That's billy's life.

425
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,900
That's the only thing
that's important to him.

426
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,800
Quiet!

427
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,100
Quiet!

428
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,600
Quiet.

429
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,500
Boxer, homicide.

430
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,800
Hey, beautiful.

431
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,900
Hi, pete. Uh... how's it going?

432
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,600
Uh, well, i'm at the hotel.

433
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,600
I'm gonna see you
before i go, right?

434
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,300
Yeah, yeah.
I'd, um, i'd really like that.

435
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,600
I'd-I'd really,
really like that.

436
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Because we should finish
our conversation.

437
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,400
Uh, uh, pete, i gotta go, okay?

438
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,800
Oh, sure. Yeah. Okay.
I'll-I'll- I'll call you later.

439
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,100
Boxer, homicide.

440
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,200
You didn't do
what i asked, lindsay.

441
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,900
You still have my father.

442
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,700
Well, billy,
let's talk about it.

443
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,600
You want to be my friend.

444
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,500
I want to tell you
that i know what happened.

445
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,300
I know what your father did
to you and your sister.

446
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,600
Too late.

447
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,000
You should've listened.

448
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,200
I almost have him.
Billy, i'm listening now.

449
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,800
What-What do you want
to tell me?

450
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,200
You made me do it again.

451
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,900
What are you talking about?

452
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,200
Billy?

453
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,400
Lindsay...

454
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,600
By the way, nice dog.

455
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,300
He's calling
from your apartment.

456
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,900
Tom!

457
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,300
Where is she?

458
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,000
Kitchen.

459
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
Are you okay?

460
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,400
Lindsay?

461
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,800
He left corinne stevens
in my bed.

462
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,900
I get to go tell richard stevens
that his wife is dead...

463
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,600
Dead because of me.

464
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,100
She's blaming herself.

465
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,500
She's got an endless loop
in her head saying it's her fault.

466
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,200
Turn it off
because you're wrong.

467
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,500
Corinne stevens has been
in rigor for more than a day.

468
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,200
She was killed six to nine hours
after she was abducted,

469
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,500
And she was already dead
when billy asked for his father's release.

470
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,900
You gotta stop feeling guilty.

471
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,200
We need you at 100%
to catch this guy.

472
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,100
I don't want another woman on my table
with her lips sewn shut,

473
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,400
So what are we
gonna do about it?

474
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,500
Find the sailboat yet?

475
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,900
His sister's death was the single
most defining moment in billy harris' life-

476
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,500
Not his mother's love,
not his first home run,
not his first kiss.

477
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,300
Witnessing
his sister's murder

478
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,200
Obliterated anything and everything
that came before or after that.

479
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,900
That's his obsession
with his father.

480
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,000
Why did he wait to start killing?

481
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,800
They found rachel's body.

482
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,600
That threatened
to expose the secret.

483
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,400
That's what provoked him before.

484
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,900
That's ???

485
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,400
You want your father
out of police custody?

486
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,800
You want us
to keep your secret?

487
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,600
Let's see how you like it when it's plastered
all over the news.

488
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,700
<i>...well over a decade</i>

489
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,200
<i>Since the initial trail
went cold,</i>

490
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,300
<i>New evidence has surfaced
that has seemingly</i>

491
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,800
<i>Broken this case wide open
for investigators.</i>

492
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,200
<i>And now this man-
John harris-</i>

493
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,600
<i>Has been arrested
for the murder</i>

494
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,500
<i>Of his 15-Year-Old daughter
rachel.</i>

495
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,900
<i>The investigation had been-</i>

496
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,000
All the morning shows ran it.

497
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,400
Billy will see it.
He'll call back.

498
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,900
And if he doesn't?

499
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,000
Tom, he won't let it go.

500
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,700
"Espresso, wheat"...

501
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,400
We're looking for billy.
You're reupholstering?

502
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,000
Married to a civilian
who teaches kindergarten.

503
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,900
What can i say?

504
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,700
She thinks the job turns off
when you leave the building.

505
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,500
Well, that's one problem
you didn't have with me.

506
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,300
Hey, lindsay. Call for you.
Theythe sending it up.

507
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,200
They think it's him.

508
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,400
Billy?

509
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,900
Why'd you push me?

510
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,500
I don't want to push you.
I want to talk to you.

511
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,500
No, lindsay, no talking.
This time i'm not forgiving you.

512
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,100
You took something
that belongs to me,

513
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,900
Which means
i had to do the same.

514
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,300
4-5-4-3-5-1- That's my cell
phone. How'd you get that number?

515
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,300
See you soon.

516
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,900
My cell phone's in my desk.

517
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,400
Is anything missing
from your apartment?

518
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,800
I haven't been back to the apartment
since claire took the body out.

519
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,500
Okay, he said he took
something of yours.

520
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,200
Maybe he doesn't mean
an object.

521
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,200
Maybe he is talking about
a person.

522
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,500
I saw cindy and jill
in jill's office.

523
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,300
I saw claire in the hall
20 minutes ago.

524
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,500
No messages.

525
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Oh, my god. He means pete.
No, no, no, no.

526
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,400
It's an i.P. Address.

527
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,200
Jacobi.

528
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,500
Can we run a trace
on the site?

529
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,700
No, it'll take days
to go through all the servers.

530
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,300
Oh, my god. It's your dad.

531
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,500
<i>Bring me my father. I'll give
you yours in exchange.</i>

532
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,100
<i>You have five minutes
to decide, inspeor.</i>

533
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,800
<i>Or i'll blow
his brains out.</i>

534
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,600
'S not a rescue, linz.
It's a suicide mission.

535
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,100
I tell billy it's possible
or he blows marty's head off.

536
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,700
<i>Think. It was a secret.
Now it's out. Game over.</i>

537
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,000
He wants to kill you, lindsay,
and then himself.

538
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,600
If it was your father,
what would you do?

539
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,500
Boxer.

540
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,900
What's your answer,
lindsay?

541
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,000
We have a deal.
Where do we meet?

542
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,700
15.7 miles east on midway road.
5:00. Don't bring company.

543
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,100
I want to speak
to my father.

544
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,600
You can talk
when you get here.

545
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,000
We have an hour to figure out how we
do this so you and your dad don't die.

546
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,800
Okay, i got
an idea, but we're gonna need some help.

547
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Lieutenant hogan.

548
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,100
Ted thorne, fbi.

549
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,400
Thanks for coming.
Inspector lindsay boxer.

550
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,000
I appreciate
your help.

551
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,400
Inspector, you've handled this
as well as anyone could.

552
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,000
We're here to help
whatever way we can.

553
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,900
This is the house in solano county
where the hostage is being held.

554
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,300
It's an old hunting cabin.

555
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,000
Only structure within a 5-Mile
radius.

556
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,500
It's cattle country.
He'd see us coming from a mile away.

557
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,400
It's too far for a sniper
to get a shot.

558
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,700
Well, since we c't get
a bullet in there,

559
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,900
I was thinking of something more up close
and personal.

560
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,000
What'd you have in mind?

561
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,900
Small explosive, like a flash-Bang grenade
with a radio signal trigger.

562
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,400
My guys can
do that. How do you get it in his hand?

563
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,500
Put it in something he wants.
Can you get a grenade in that?

564
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,200
Sure. We'll put the bear
in a bag. You bring it to him.

565
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:33,000
We'll wire your jacket
for a mike.

566
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,400
You get him to hold it,
send us the signal.

567
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,700
Carl can remote detonate the
bomb.

568
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,000
How far away do i have to be?

569
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,200
6 to 8 feet.
6 to 8 feet at least.

570
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,500
If there are any surprises,
you let us know.

571
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,900
We'll be there in 30 seconds.

572
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,200
A lot can happen
in 30 seconds.

573
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,500
The d.A. Found
a cooperative judge.

574
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,800
Billy's dad pleads down to manslaughter
on the murder of rachel,

575
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,900
And in exchange, he agrees to go with you.

576
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,800
Let's go.

577
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
We just wanted to ask-

578
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,600
'Cause we are taking you
to dinner after all of this-

579
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,000
Pizza, japanese or greek?

580
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,600
We want
to hear all about the big adventure.

581
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,800
And your good-Bye with pete-
What he said, what you said.

582
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,700
Yeah, he's leaving at 9:00,
so i may not make it.

583
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,300
Not if you talk
that way, you won't.

584
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:26,000
Uh, pizza, japanese, greek-
You pick. Surprise me.

585
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,700
Remember, if i don't
make it outta this,

586
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,600
I never liked you
that much anyway.

587
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,600
Come on.

588
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,700
Head down.

589
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,200
These restraints
are excessive.

590
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,000
That's what criminals wear.

591
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,600
You know the main reason
parents kill kids?

592
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,100
Because daddy wants something
the child won't give.

593
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,700
That's what happened,
isn't it?

594
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,400
You wanted her, and she fought back,
and billy saw the whole thing.

595
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,900
He saw you try to take her.
He saw you kill her.

596
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,100
How'd you keep him quiet?

597
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,300
What a pretty speech.

598
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,000
You made your son a monster.

599
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,600
He is what he is
because of you.

600
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,500
You don't understand anything.

601
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,300
She's got the bear,
and it's in the bag.

602
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,400
Are we getting a signal from
her mike?

603
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,000
The signal is clear.

604
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,100
Everyone's set.

605
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,300
We have sound
on lindsay and harris now.

606
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,300
<i>I n't see billy anywhere.</i>

607
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,300
<i>He's here.
His truck's behind the cabin.</i>

608
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,700
Billy!

609
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,500
Come on.

610
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,500
Your father's here!

611
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,300
Drop the bag.
Hands on your head.

612
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,100
Where's my father?

613
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:10,900
In a minute.

614
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,800
We had a deal, billy.
Where is he?

615
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,900
I said shut up.

616
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,200
Daddy...

617
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,100
I'm sorry.

618
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,600
It's falling apart. I...
can't keep it inside anymore.

619
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,500
What the hell are you talking
about? What's falling apart?

620
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,900
I don't like where this is going.

621
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,700
She's okay. She knows what she's dng.

622
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,900
I tried to protect you.

623
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,800
I tried to keep the secret.

624
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,100
Not another word!

625
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,100
I did what you said, daddy.

626
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,400
Never tell.

627
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,500
Never tell. Never tell.

628
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,000
Never tell.
Never tell!

629
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,500
Never tell.

630
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,400
I was a good boy.

631
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,600
Then they fod rachel.

632
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,100
I love you, daddy.

633
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,900
Your turn.

634
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,800
Inside.

635
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,900
What are you doing?

636
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
I ju-I have some things
that you want.

637
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,300
What?

638
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,400
It was things
that belonged to rachel.

639
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,000
Carl, get ready to blow it.

640
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,900
Remember, on her signal.

641
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,700
No.

642
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,200
No, i don't want those.
Billy-

643
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,100
Move.

644
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,500
Okay, we gotta get her
outta there. We can't.

645
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,500
She doesn't have the flash bomb.
She's helpless.

646
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,700
If we go in now, lindsay and her dad
are dead before we get in the house.

647
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,400
<i> Go inside.</i>

648
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,100
Hey, kid.

649
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,200
No talking!

650
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,800
You stop right there.

651
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,800
Just stay.

652
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,100
She was beautiful.

653
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,600
Yeah, billy, she was.
I didn't save her from daddy.

654
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,800
You couldn't.
You were too young.

655
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,100
No, i was too scared.
I could'veaved her.

656
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,100
I could've saved her.
I didn't save her.

657
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,300
I didn't stop.

658
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,000
You shouldn't have come
here, lindsay.

659
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Quiet, old man!

660
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,500
Wait, billy-

661
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,600
Stop!

662
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,400
This has nothing to do
with my father.

663
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,300
Okay? Let him go.

664
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,500
Oh, he stays.

665
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,800
What happened to rachel,
it wasn't your fault.

666
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,100
It was your father's.

667
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,100
So you know what that means?

668
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,300
You can stop
with all of this.

669
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,000
Your father is gone.

670
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,300
You don't have to keep
the secret anymore.

671
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,200
No, the secret's out.

672
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,300
You let the secret out.

673
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,400
Tell her she's a bad daughter
and this is all her fault.

674
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,300
Stay right there.
No.

675
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,500
She's a screwup. She's
a waste of... billy-

676
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,200
Flesh and bone.
She doesn't deserve to live.

677
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,300
Say it.

678
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,000
I love you, baby.

679
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,300
I love you with all my heart.

680
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,000
No!

681
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,100
Go! Go!
All units, move!

682
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,400
Gun.

683
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,900
Dad?

684
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,300
Daddy?!

685
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,900
It's okay, daddy. Officer down!
Get the e.M.T.S now!

686
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,600
The e.M.T. Said it was
a clean in and out.

687
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
I'm gonna be fine.

688
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,900
Well, i'll come check on you
later tonight.

689
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,200
You don't have to do that.
I know.

690
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,200
Thank for coming
to get me, baby.

691
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,900
I'll see you
in a couple hours.

692
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,600
Yeah.

693
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,800
You did okay today.

694
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,000
I may have to treat you
with something resembling respect.

695
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,200
Man, don't go overboard.

696
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,100
The press got wind
of what happened.

697
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,000
The p.I.O. Wants to know
if you feel up to talking with some reporters.

698
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,700
No. No. Uh, you'll-
I gotta get to the airport.

699
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,900
You'll handle it
for me, okay?

700
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,900
What are you doing?

701
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,100
Excuse me. Sorry.

702
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,100
Uh...
passport.

703
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,200
Uh, yeah. S.F.P.D.
I need to get to gate 24.

704
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,500
Sorry, ma'am. I can't let you
do that.

705
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,500
There's no problem.

706
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,200
I just need to get in there. Only be
a minute.

707
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,600
Ma'am, i can't let you in withouan
okay from my supervisor.

708
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,800
No, i can't wait.

709
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,400
I need to talk
to someone, okay?

710
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,100
He is on the 9:10 to phnom penh,
which is leaving in 18 minutes.

711
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,600
And look, if i don't say good-Bye to this man,
i am gonna regret it for the rest of my life.

712
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,200
So can you just-Can you just please let
me in? You should probably let her go.

713
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,600
What a-What are you
doing out here?

714
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,000
Waiting for you.

715
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,100
Uh, d-Does
this mean you're staying?

716
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,200
No, it means there's a flight to taipel in four
hours that gets me to cambodia tomorrow.

717
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,800
It also means i couldn't leave
without talking to you.

718
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,700
Okay, there's like...

719
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,100
A thousand things that i-
I want to say right now.

720
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:45,000
So... okay, for a long time,

721
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,100
I've beehanging on to
a lot of feelings
about... everything.

722
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,900
And i finally finished
this nightmare.

723
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,400
And... and the point i'm trying to make
is that... i think i can be happy.

724
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,400
Well, i-I-I want to be happy.

725
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,000
And...

726
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,900
I'm just really sorry that i didn't realize it
until you were about to leave.

727
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:17,900
And... i just wanted you to know that-That i'm gonna
miss you more-More than i want to think about.

728
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,900
That's nice to hear, linz.

729
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,900
Okay.

730
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,400
Now here's the thing-
This dsn't have to end.

731
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:42,000
I mean, i-I don't get a lot of time off,
but when i do, i'd like- I'd like to come back to you.

732
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,600
What i'm saying is that
between my vacations, yours,

733
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Uh, cell phones, a little patience,
we can make it work.

734
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,800
It's-It's only a year.

735
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,700
Doesn't sound like
muchf an offer, but-

736
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,700
Yes.

737
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,400
I- I would like that.
Yes?

738
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,100
Yes, yes.
Yes.

739
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,100
I would like that.
I would like that very much.

740
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
Hey. Sorry i'm late.

741
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,100
I had to stop at the bureau and
get my stuff back. No problem.

742
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,200
So, uh,
how was the good-Bye?

743
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,500
It was not so much a good-Bye
as it was a continuation.

744
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,400
He's staying?

745
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,100
No. But he's coming back
from time to time.

746
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,200
Eventually.

747
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,300
It's better than it sounds.

748
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,900
It is.

749
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,000
The long-Distance thing
never works. Take it from me.

750
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Hello?
A little support maybe.

751
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,900
She's right. He's been
pretty great so far.

752
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,000
Exactly. And i can take
some vacation time and go visit him.

753
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,300
Uh-Huh. When was, um,

754
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,700
When was the last time
you took a vacation?

755
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,000
Seventh grade, maybe?

756
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,200
Okay, you know what?

757
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,100
You people have absolutely
no faith in romance

758
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,700
Or two people who care
about each other. Boxer.

759
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,000
10 bucks says
in half-Hour from now,

760
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,700
We're at a crime scene.

761
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,900
I was so looking forward to shrimp.

762
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,300
I don't understand. I...

763
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,300
I thought he was fine.
I thought it was nothing.

764
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,200
N- Never mind. Yeah. I, uh,
i'll-I'll be right there.

765
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,300
Linz?

766
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,800
It's my dad.

767
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,800
