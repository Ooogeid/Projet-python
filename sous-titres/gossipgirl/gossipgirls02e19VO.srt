00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,090
gossip girl here,

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,970
your one and only source  into the
scandalous lives  of manhattan's elite.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,680
Yale has rescinded your acceptance
and given the spot to nelly.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,500
Doesn't hurt nearly as bad as waking up that morning
in santorini and finding you jumped on a boat.

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,930
That night wasn'exactly
what I signed up for either.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,490
When yto dominica,he could only get his
hands on enough money to get himself set up.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,390
Weon't have any money.

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,640
the van der bilts do.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,810
But why would my grandparents pay us to go live
with him why they can't even help us out here?

10
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,500
Isn't it just breathtaking?

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,500
mom,your art consultant
has ent has exquisite taste.

12
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,830
You've got a good heart.

13
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,330
You should give it
to somebody who cares.

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,890
- Miss blair is out,mr.Chuck.
- I'll wait.

15
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,040
Carter,what are you doing here?

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,070
Buying you a drink.

20
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,650
spring time on the upper east side,

21
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,490
where the winter chill is
supposed to be so last season.

22
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,360
But when mittens and scarves
are still all the rage,

23
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,020
the best thing you can do is just
button up and hope for warmer days,

24
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,420
and hope for warmer days

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,930
ah,there's nothing like
summer in the eastern bloc.

26
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,510
Just a eurail pass and a backpack
full of failed socialist policies.

27
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,900
and nate.

28
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,920
The vienna state opera one
day,ay,pierogies in poland the next.

29
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,530
No map,no reservations,just total
freedom,and nate is super excited,too.

30
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,980
Probably not as excited as he is
about our day of college basketball.

31
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,410
- I know your mom's out of
town,but if you came-- hey,guys.

32
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,500
Hey,this is my cousin tripp.

33
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,490
This is my girlfriend vanessa.

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,490
- This is dan.
- Dan.Nice to meet you.

35
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,900
I'm trying to convince nate here to make an
appearance at the family hoodoo this weekend--

36
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,650
lunch today,cocktail party tomorrow.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,530
Hey,maureen will be there.

38
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,870
We're engaged now.

39
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,310
I didn't know that.That's fantastic.

40
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,210
Yeah,well,you missed a lot.

41
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,170
Hey,why don't you drop by?

42
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,260
Grandfather would love to see you,too.

43
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,520
You know,I appreciate it,tripp.

44
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,930
I do.There's just a
lot of stuff going on.

45
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,770
Okay,I can take a hint.

46
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,750
Call me if you change
your mind,all right?

47
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,870
I will.I will.Congratulations.

48
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,100
Thanks,man.

49
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,110
- It was nice meeting you.
- Bye.

50
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,600
Nice to meeting you,tripp.

51
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,330
You--you're gonna skip
out on your family reunion?

52
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,790
I appreciate the
commitment to the game--

53
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,400
no,listen,man,I'm not gonna go
pretend to bond with the people

54
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,990
who shut me and my mom
out when my dad got busted.

55
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,490
Let's go inside.The game's starting.

56
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,220
hello,sweetheart.

57
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,810
Chuck,I have been looking
for my phone all morning.

58
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,000
I was checking to see if
blair changed her number.

59
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,070
Well,if she's not calling you
back,you should probably take the hint.

60
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,560
I went to see her last week.

61
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,740
She never came home.

62
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,510
It's not like our girl
to be out all night.

63
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,310
I know something's going on.

64
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,840
This is more than her having her
dirty laundry aired on "gossip girl.

65
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,650
" She,um... she got rejected by yale.

66
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,390
The only thing she wanted more than me.

67
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,150
That would be painful.

68
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,530
Chuck,she's embarrassed,so we just need
to give her some time to lick her wounds.

69
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,770
Maybe I can lick them for her.

70
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,830
blair,hey,it's me.

71
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,840
Now here's an extraordi pry newiece
I can get from a private collector--

72
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,880
I thought perhapsthfor e bedroom.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,110
Oh,I agree.It's perfect.

74
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,680
oh,excuse me one moment.

75
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,500
Hello,rufus.

76
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,150
Oh,I wish I could talk,my darling,but
I'm right in the middle of something.

77
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,740
Okay.Bye.

78
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:45,670
Lily... I just want to thank you
for handling this so gracefully...

79
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,140
the whole rufus thing...

80
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,590
the whole "rufus and
i used to date" thing?

81
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,850
Oh,god.

82
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:01,440
Please tell me that I'm not putting
an enormous foot in my mouth.

83
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,290
He told you,right?

84
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,090
Well,of course he did.

85
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,740
It's fine.

86
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,250
So you were thinking above the bed?

87
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,510
I think it'll look fantastic there.

88
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,890
I figured out the split screen.

89
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,620
All right.Now we can watch
all four games at once.

90
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,910
what were you guys talking about?

91
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,870
Are you sure you don't want
to go to your family reunion?

92
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,260
We know they weren't
cool to you and your mom,

93
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,750
but,I mean,it seems like your
cousin is trying to make up for it.

94
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,770
Yeah,well,unless he's armed with an
engraved apology from my grandfather,

95
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:36,950
I do not care.

96
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,870
Nate,they're making an effort.

97
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,360
Yeah,sure they're making an effort now.

98
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,240
But where were they when we needed them?

99
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,090
You've told me about your
summers with your cousins,

100
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,480
about your grandfather teaching you to sail,how
much you used to look forward to christmas.

101
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,660
You loved them.

102
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,500
Now if you really don't want to go,fine.

103
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,620
But don't pretend you don't care.

104
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,500
She wasn't my girlfriend.

105
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,390
We just went out a few times.

106
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,450
You might have mentioned
that,considering that she works for me.

107
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,280
It was humiliating.

108
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,090
Well,I've been meaning to tell you.

109
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,870
You know,it's a shame
we never see each other.

110
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,510
Are there any other exes I should know
about-- my trainer,my accountant... 

111
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,550
I'm sorry.But it's not like I ever asked
you to make a list of everyone you've dated.

112
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,490
- Yes,well,I'd be happy to make one.
- Sure.

113
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,210
- Do you think I wouldn't?
- I don't think about it.

114
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,510
I think we should just drop it.

115
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,770
- Let's make lists.
- Lily.

116
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,950
Look,you clearly have some idea about
my past and I'd prefer to dispel,

117
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,380
and this way I won't be
blindsided again unless,

118
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,350
of course,there's something
that you don't want known.

119
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,990
All right.

120
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,910
Okay. Tonight,then,at dinner.

121
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,150
Be ready.

122
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,540
This has disaster written all over it.

123
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,970
oh,there's tripp.

124
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,160
What?

125
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,280
Nate,you said it was a
mansion,not a country club.

126
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,710
Nate... changed your mind.

127
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,600
Six times,actually.

128
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,400
- ****
- Hey,tripp.

129
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,650
it's flying low.There
must be a hospital nearby.

130
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,800
It's not a
medevac.It's,uh,grandfather's ride.

131
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,600
He's gonna be so surprised to see you.

132
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,430
Wait.I thought this was his idea.

133
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,730
Not exactly.

134
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,670
So I came to give him a
chance,and he didn't even want one?

135
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,020
- No. No,no.
- Nate,wait.

136
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,410
You've come this far.

137
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,330
Come on.

138
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,710
nathaniel.

139
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,500
I'm so delighted you're here.My boy!

140
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,530
we've missed you.

141
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,730
Looks like V.

142
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,060
Is leading  a lost
lamb back to the flock.

143
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,040
And C.Is coming to B.

144
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,120
Sheepishly bearing gifts.

145
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,460
I would have been here sooner.

146
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,810
- I stopped to pick up a little something.
- How thoughtful.

147
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,450
Serena thinks you're
in some kind of trouble.

148
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,200
Seems to me your only problem is
having a party all by your lonesome.

149
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,620
Except she's not alone.

150
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,060
What are you doing with this insect?

151
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,320
Having the time of my
life.Thank you very much.

152
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,910
Well,as much as I enjoy bursting your
bubble,he's just using you to get at me.

153
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,900
Ask him about his role as a kidnapper
for a certain secret gentleman's club.

154
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,400
I should know.I had him expelled.

155
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,130
Oh,please.All I did is bring that
girl to a waiting pile of cash,

156
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:38,460
which I understand she gladly took
before leaving town... without you.

157
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:42,740
- Blair...
this guy-- what?

158
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,620
Dishonest?Bad news?

159
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,050
He can't be any worse than you.

160
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,070
I'm the one trying to help you.

161
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,680
Help me?

162
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,960
Is that what you were doing at your little
gentleman's club while my life was going up in flames?

163
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,820
I'd rather take carter's help.

164
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,800
We hear carter baizen's dealt
 chuck another losing hand.

165
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,880
This is a little seat,Secretary
of state simon van der bilt.

166
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,900
Governor hamilton van der bilt.

167
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,660
A family history of distinguished public
and it all began with johannes van der bilt.

168
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,560
He came to america 250 years ago.

169
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,290
Found coal in pennsylvania.

170
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:33,680
You n understand why we're proud to be
celebrating our family's anniversary this weekend.

171
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,990
We started with almost nothing.

172
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,800
Finally something I can relate to.

173
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,090
And now all this.

174
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,700
Or not.

175
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,830
Nathaniel,let's show your friends
the presidential medals of freedom.

176
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,110
finally!

177
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,130
So tell me,nathaniel,what
are your plans next year?

178
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,570
Well,I'm waiting to
hear back from colleges.

179
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,660
The only thing is,when everything
went down with my father,

180
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,340
it was around the time
applications were due.

181
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,990
So I didn't exactly knock
the essays out of the park.

182
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,100
Another unfortunate by-product
of that regrettable situation,

183
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,310
which,I might add,you handled admirably.

184
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,350
Admirably?

185
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,890
I thought you were ashamed of me.

186
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,060
Oh,on the contrary.I've
never been more proud.

187
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,980
You stood by your mother.You got
your father to do what was right.

188
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:26,550
I used to worry that,um,you got her looks and
his brains,but you proved me wrong on that.

189
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,650
you're a part of this
legacy,too,nathaniel.

190
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:34,800
So... who's up for some touch football?

191
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,560
Come on.

192
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,340
Do you know how exhausting it's been
being blair waldorf for the past 18 ars--

193
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,990
all the work,the planning?

194
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,170
You mean plotting?

195
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,920
Yes,exactly.

196
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,840
I'm glad it all blew up in my face.

197
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,020
It was a wake-up call.

198
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,760
I was such an overachiever,I was
headed for a quarterlife crisis at 18.

199
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,810
Oh,B.You've had a couple of setbacks,

200
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,720
but there must still be a way
to get into a great college,

201
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,370
and if anyone can do it,it's you.

202
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,490
No,S.,I've learned the hard way.

203
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,660
I can't control
everything,plan everything.

204
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,700
Now with carter's help,I'm
trying something different.

205
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,840
Inact,if I'm somewhere,and I can
say,"blair waldorf would never do that,"

206
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,360
guess what?I'll do it.

207
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,560
B.?B. You have to pay for those.

208
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,990
So call security.

209
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,260
We have a problem.

210
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,230
Let me
guess--carter baizen?

211
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,270
As usual,you're a step behind.

212
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,070
He's encouraging the worst in her.

213
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,210
True.

214
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:57,290
Unfortunately,my P.I. Has yet to dig up an unpaid
creditor or a jealous husband that would clear baizen out.

215
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,210
Tell him you want to see him.

216
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,580
Why?What do you have?

217
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,110
Just do it.

218
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,420
did you and blair find
anything you like at V.B.H.?

219
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,910
Well,blair certainly did.

220
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,950
Are you reorganizing?

221
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,090
Oh,no.Just reminiscing.

222
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,520
Why is bart's name next to
trent reznor and the klauses?

223
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,510
Oh,my god.

224
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,990
- It's,um--
mom,what is that?

225
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,610
- It's-- no,no.Please
don't answer.

226
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,240
It's a long story between me and rufus.

227
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,430
Wait.You're not showing
rufus that,are you?

228
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,920
Well,we agreed to be
up-front with each other.

229
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,360
Up-front?Okay,but,mom,

230
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,340
it's gonna take him 20 minutes
to get through the '90s alone.

231
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,620
I know.I know.

232
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,930
We got into this tiff because
he hadn't told me he dated bex.

233
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,910
And then the next thing I
know,I was saying yes to lists.

234
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,580
And how am I gonna back out now?

235
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,820
Besides,I'm not ashamed of
my past... most of it,anyway.

236
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,840
Do you think he'll judge?

237
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:10,880
I think you should just sneak a peek at his little
black book before you drop the yellow pages on him.

238
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,530
- Just make sure your numbers are on par.
- Okay.

239
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,590
Slash?Seriously?

240
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,590
what,there's no penalty?

241
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,190
You want me toall that?

242
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,950
I thought this was touch,not rugby.

243
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,990
I forgot how the van der
bilts like to play football.

244
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,120
B.S.,Man.Do you quit?

245
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,980
No.No,no,no.Play.

246
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,090
I remember my first time here.

247
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,150
Intimidating.

248
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,010
I'm maureen,tripp's fianc.

249
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,960
Vanessa.Nice to meet you.

250
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,650
And "yes" on the intimidating front.

251
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,530
I feel like a republican
at the kennedy compound.

252
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,890
Oh,don't fret.Everyone loves you.

253
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,090
They're probably already
designing the campaign posters.

254
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,720
- What do you mean?
- I assume you saw the hall o' governors?

255
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,660
Politics is a van der bilt birthright.

256
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,420
- And with nate's charm and your background...
- excuse me?

257
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:38,420
Nate mentioned you're kind of an activist
in your community-- a documentary filmmaker?

258
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,990
Oh,yeah.Well,I think
you've been misinformed.

259
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,540
The only thing nate's ever
voted for isamerican idol.

260
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,030
" Tripp was the same way.

261
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,760
He wanted to be an archaeologist
in college,like indiana jones.

262
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,850
Now he's law review at yale and
about to clerk for the supreme court.

263
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,030
Grandfather can be very persuasive.

264
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,030
welcome to the next 30 years.

265
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,820
I'm surprised.

266
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,220
You waved the white flag so soon.

267
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,300
Goes down almost as easy as you did.

268
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,750
So it was all just a game.

269
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,270
initially,yes.

270
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,980
Though I have to
admit,blair surprised me.

271
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,000
that girl certainly
knows how to let loose.

272
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,320
Victory never tasted so sweet.

273
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,380
Speaking of which,do
you mind if I take this?

274
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,150
Blair's meeting me at a party,and it's not
the kind of place she should be left alone.

275
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,980
Actually,I don't think
you're gonna be making that.

276
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,740
what's this?

277
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,590
Good cop/bass cop?

278
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,080
Blair needs to regroup,so
you need to bid adieu.

279
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,970
Dubai again?

280
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,680
nice try,but I'm having too much fun.

281
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,190
Nothing's gonna get me to leave town.

282
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,250
What about santorini?

283
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,250
Do you think blair will
want to hear about that?

284
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,720
The greek
guy--spiros?

285
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,290
The greek police?

286
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,550
I still have all of their phone
numbers from when they questioned me.

287
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,420
You wouldn'T.

288
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,520
I would,but I won't if
you leave town now,alone.

289
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,980
E  therare a few things I could
hold over your head from that trip.

290
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,930
But consider us even.

291
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,880
If the two of you think that getting rid of me is
gonna magically change back your friend,think again.

292
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,850
I'm just a symptom of
the disease,not the cause.

293
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,900
What happened in santorini?

294
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,930
Let's find blair.I want
to make sure she's okay.

295
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,600
Spotted--B.Taking one 
small step for new blair...

296
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,190
one giant step  towards
a strange townhouse.

297
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,420
Enter at your own risk,B.

298
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,680
Hello.

299
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,170
whatever your style.

300
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,060
The new schick quattro I think
we've made a cle possible small talk.

301
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,590
I think we should just get it over
with before the kids come home.

302
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,550
I will,uh,go first.

303
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,400
Is it all right?

304
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,890
Yes,of course.

305
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,050
Um... and... this is the whole thing?

306
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,450
That's it.

307
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,080
Okay.Well,then,that's just,uh...

308
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,450
okay,I'll just get mine.

309
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,360
oh,here I am.

310
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,130
I'm sorry.

311
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,610
It's just,well,I'm-- I'm relieved...
please don't take that the wrong way.

312
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,640
- Oh,no.
- It's just you've dated more people than I have,

313
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,150
and I wasn't sure that
we'd be in the same ballpark.

314
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,360
Well,I'm glad that that is behind us.

315
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,050
Me,too.

316
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,990
I'll get dessert.

317
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,290
What happened to you?

318
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,450
It's called,uh,getting
to know the van der bilts.

319
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,230
Turned out to be less
"gatsby" and more "fight club.

320
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,090
Don't worry.I'm okay.I'm fine.

321
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,030
Well,you'd better recover by tomorrow.

322
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,740
Nate told his grandfather we'd come
to the reception at the country house.

323
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,930
Oh,reception at the country
house.That's very blazer and chinos.

324
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,380
Do you want me to overnight
you a rep tie from bluefly?

325
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,360
Thanks,no.Could you get
me something for my ankle?

326
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,050
Sure.

327
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,280
So?

328
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,270
- Spill it.
- Spill what?

329
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,360
Come on,the minute we
dropped nate off,you just--

330
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,210
you clammed up,and you
got that look on your face.

331
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,620
What look?I don't have a look.

332
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,550
He's right.You definitely have the look.

333
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,360
- Here.Cold.
- You're right.Thank you.

334
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:47,560
Fine.When I encouraged nate to reconnect with his
family,I had no idea it came with such expectations.

335
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,670
And it just sounds like nate's
grandfather lays out your life for you.

336
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,300
They're the van der
bilts,not the corleones.

337
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,090
This may snd silly.

338
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,420
It's just I don't want nate to get pushed in to the
family sausage grinder and come out a clone of his cousin.

339
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,600
Why don't you just tell him that?

340
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,540
Because he just got his grandfather back
in his life,and he seems really happy.

341
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,900
And the last thing I'd want to do is
say something that might keep them apart.

342
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,810
Nate's a pretty understanding guy when he's
not maiming people on the football field.

343
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,770
So if you're worried,yeah,you
should just tell him.

344
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,140
What do you mean,she's not
here?She went to that pty alone?

345
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,130
Look,you have to tell us where she is.

346
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,660
I am sorry,but miss blair very specific--
no tell miss serena,no tell mr.Chuck.

347
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:27,290
But if mr.Chuck come,tell him mr.Carter
is more attentive to a woman's--

348
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,330
enough.I'm not going
to play where's waldorf?

349
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,710
All night.How much is it gonna cost?

350
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,850
How much?

351
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:39,190
miss blair...

352
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,960
dorota,dorota,please.

353
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:41,930
Can't you see that blair has changed?

354
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,800
Yes.It is old miss blair
then new miss blair,

355
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,100
like it was old miss serena,now new
miss serena.Very hard to keep track.

356
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,200
Okay.Okay.Blair is at a party right
now alone with some very bad people.

357
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,650
We just want to help her.Please.

358
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,650
I know grandfather's pretty strong-willed,but if you're
worried I'm gonna be pushed into anything,don't be.

359
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,980
Because I am really happy that
you've reconnected with your family.

360
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,230

Just--

361
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,270
Nothing's gonna change.

362
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,920
hold on just one second.

363
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,930
Hey,tripp.What's going on?

364
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,150
Wait.Where,in the city?

365
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,380
I'd love to,but I'm on a date right now.

366
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,620
Yeah.

367
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,100
All right,just tell
grandfather I said I'm sorry.

368
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,440
All right,thanks,man.Bye.

369
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,100
You should go meet them.

370
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,500
But we're eating pierogies.

371
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:46,340
****

372
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,850
*********

373
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:53,820
****

374
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,400
don't forget we have the party tomorrow.

375
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,200
Okay.

376
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,690
All right.Have fun.

377
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,080
- may I help you?
- Great.

378
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,570
Looks like polanski's in town.

379
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,070
please don't do this.

380
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,610
Blair.

381
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,050
Chuck?

382
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,870
What are you doing here?

383
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,010
Miss waldorf,as I was saying,I met with
you as a favor to your headmistress.

384
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,280
But sarah lawrence cannot accept
someone who has hazed a teacher.

385
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,850
But,dean wheeler,that was a
1-time mistake,an aberration.

386
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,980
- dean wheeler?
- looks like we may have made an error.

387
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,950
Colleges stopped accepting
applications months ago.

388
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,660
Please?I don't have any other options.

389
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,960
I'm sorry,but you have my answer.

390
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,800
B. B.,Why didn't you tell us?

391
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,890
What,that I was coming to debase myself by
begging to be accepted at sarah lawrence?

392
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,190
Gee,you're right.Why didn't
I update my facebook page?

393
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,110
It's nice to know the old blair
is still in there somewhere.

394
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,830
I knew you wouldn't give
up.You're wrong.I just did.

395
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,480
Don't follow me!

396
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,080
Poor B.Couldn't spin 
this one in her favor.

397
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,100
Looks like now  she's spinning out.

398
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,410
why are we crashing
nate's family reunion?

399
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,890
And why would blair be here?

400
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,880
Well,dorota tipped me off.She's coming.

401
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,700
Maybe she's ready to relaunch
herself into blue blood society.

402
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,180
Blair!

403
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,820
Hey,you--you
look great.

404
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,240
- I feel great.
- Why?

405
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:06,990
Because I realized that while we can't
tear out a single page of our life,

406
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,740
we can throw the whole book in the fire.

407
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,230
George sand.She understands me.

408
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,360
And what better place to go up ismoke than in
front of the cre de la crme of new york society?

409
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,400
Blair waldorf.

410
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,180
How are you,dear?

411
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,680
I heard you've rejected the colony club.

412
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,670
Too stuffy for my taste,as well.

413
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:30,470
That's because your tastes include sleeping
with your driver and popping prescription meds.

414
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,740
Okay,not good.

415
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:40,220
Not good--like dan having sex with rachel carr in
the costume closet during the school play,not good?

416
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:44,890
By the end of tonight,the old blair waldorf will
be dead and buried with no chance of resurrection.

417
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,640
Hey,you,garn with the bubble butt.

418
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,400
Arr!

419
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,770
- That was...
- yeah.

420
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,550
Go find dan.

421
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:58,320
I'll make sure this social
eulogy doesn't get out of hand.

422
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,750
Thanks,chuck.

423
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,220
Security check?

424
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,760
I can't even put my lipstick in here.

425
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,030
What could I possibly
be trying to sneak in?

426
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,510
I don't know.Liberal agenda?

427
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,210
Universal health care?Education reform?

428
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,050
Increase in the estate tax?

429
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,880
well... I see you got my delivery.

430
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,640
Ah,yes,I did.Thank you.

431
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,390
- It fits perfectly.
- Of course it does.

432
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,080
Glad you could join us again,daniel.

433
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,920
I hope we weren't too
hard on you yesterday.

434
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,970
Oh,no,no.I've always wanted a football
injury to impress the ladies with.

435
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,650
Touch football injury?

436
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,300
Would you two mind if I
borrowed him for a while?

437
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,990
No,you two go and talk and
we'll,um,catch up with you later.

438
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,360
- Drink?
- Drinks.

439
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,860
You think the humphreys have a crest?

440
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,410
Maybe something jenny could
stitch on to one of my cardigans?

441
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,470
And,uh,don't for tthe egg rolls.

442
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,200
Very important.

443
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,680
All right,thanks.

444
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,230
Lil?

445
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,530
Do you have,uh,cash for tip?

446
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:15,950
rufus,do you need something?

447
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,620
how about the truth?

448
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,240
Vanessa.

449
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,580
Tripp.You look like you're having fun.

450
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,400
Top-shelf all the way.

451
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,630
so you excited for nate's
big adventure this summer?

452
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,400
He told you about our backpacking trip?

453
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,590
I was talking about the
internship at the mayor's office.

454
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,680
It's why william wanted
nate to meet him last night.

455
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,330
You didn't know.

456
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,930
There must be a misunderstanding.

457
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,430
Nate and I are traveling this summer.

458
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,170
Yeah.

459
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,320
I-I guess there must be.

460
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,300
anything you want to say to me?

461
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,580
Who ld you?

462
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,640
Tripp.

463
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,430
tell me that you told your grandfather
you already made plans for the summer.

464
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,900
Look,I haven't made any decisions yet.

465
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,840
No,you haven'T.Your grandfather
made this decision for you.

466
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,160
It's not like that.

467
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,610
Then tell me what it's
like,because two days ago

468
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,110
you were so excited to get away
from everything,just the two of us.

469
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,350
I know,and I still am,okay?

470
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,590
But it is an amazing opportunity.

471
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:43,600
For what?To turn into tripp?Is
that who you wanna be in five year

472
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,760
I don't know who I want to
become in the next five years.

473
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,250
That's the point.

474
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,570
If this is something I honestly
thought you wanted,I'd be happy for you.

475
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,270
But can you really tell me this isn't
about what william wants you to do?

476
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,080
As opposed to what you want me to do?

477
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,980
I didn't mean that.

478
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:04,620
It's just... my
grandfather believes in me.

479
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,690
- so...
- Oh,blair.

480
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,680
- What are we talking about?
- It's good to see you,blair.

481
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,430
Is your mother here?

482
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,470
No.It's  a shame,though.

483
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,000
She should be here to see this.

484
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:20,860
oh,you must have her call me.

485
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:25,210
Gerald and I just got engaged,and I need
an eleanor waldorf design for the big day.

486
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:30,760
Sure.Though,I think she discontinued her
"third-trip-down-the-aisle- only-took-the-plunge- for-money" line.

487
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,690
Oh,blair.I think you've
had too much to drink.

488
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,240
Oh,you would know.

489
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,870
Three D.U.I.S now,is
it?Now that I blame you.

490
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,950
Her way to escape the whispers that you made
your money in adult entertainment web sites.

491
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,300
- *****
- Bye.

492
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,980
big fan of your sites.

493
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:53,800
You about done?

494
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,970
No.

495
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,400
What are you doing?

496
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,460
Trying to destroy thu,old
yo burn every bridge?

497
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,620
It won't help.Believe me.I've tried.

498
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,330
Well,maybe I should head up to the
roof,make it a little more dramatic.

499
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,670
- This isn't you.
- How do you know?

500
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,970
Because I know you
better than I know myself.

501
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,460
Oh,right.

502
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:17,530
You can see right through
me... can't you,chuck?

503
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:20,350
Right to my core.

504
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,650
Do you remember the first
time you saw the real me?

505
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,370
The blair that danced for
you that night at victrola?

506
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:38,200
The blair with none of the hang-ups,none of
the frustrations-- that's the blair right here.

507
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,840
take me now.

508
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,870
Why?

509
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,570
To prove that nothing matters.

510
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,280
No.

511
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,480
This isn't you.

512
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,850
It's not the blair I want.

513
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,580
That's right.

514
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,170
And I never will be again.

515
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:12,990
The danger  with calling someone's
bluff  is that even if you win...

516
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,880
good-bye,chuck.

517
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,250
You risk them walking away
 from the table for good.

518
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,160
And who likes to play  with themselves?

519
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,920
What are you doing out here?

520
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,710
I don't know.

521
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,040
Well,here.

522
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,980
Take that.

523
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,490
Do you remember the first
time you brought me here?

524
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,100
When we first started dating?

525
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:02,380
- We were,like--
12 or 13.

526
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,950
we used to talk about our future.

527
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,980
How perfect everything
would be.Remember?

528
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,120
Yeah.

529
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,310
what happened?

530
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,440
when did....

531
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:29,710
everything get so screwed up?

532
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,660
This isn't how it's supposed to be.

533
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:37,510
I don't know who I am
anymore,what I'm supposed to do.

534
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:43,890
- I feel so...
- lost.

535
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:03,750
Do you remember when you used to make us
watch your favorite movies over and over again?

536
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:07,930
Like "tiffany's" and "holiday"?

537
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,580
It used to drive me nuts.

538
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,820
Is this a pep talk?

539
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:18,820
Well,I finally asked you why you liked
watching movies you've already seen,

540
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,080
and you remember what you said?

541
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,420
I like knowing how
things are gonna turn out.

542
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,570
Exactly.

543
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,280
You know,growing up,I never
knew who I was supposed to be...

544
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:40,390
so I'd spend all my time
apologizing for the privilege

545
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:48,240
and the wealth and the opportunities I
felt other people deserved more than I did.

546
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,400
And you know what I'm finally learning?

547
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,100
You can't fight against who you are.

548
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,990
And you are blair waldorf.

549
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:04,940
What happened to the nate archibald who
just wanted to get high and play "halo"?

550
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,250
I don't know.

551
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,620
Well,I better,um,I better head inside.

552
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,580
Nate.

553
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,860
Don't forget your jacket.

554
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,600
Thank you.

555
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:57,250
- Nasere,How are
- What was that for?

556
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,960
I don't know,newland archer.

557
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,110
Try to rack your brain a little.

558
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,890
Blair told you about me and rachel.

559
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,540
- And the costume closet,yes.
- Well,you and I were broken up.

560
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:08,230
Oh,so that makes it okay
to have sex with a teacher?

561
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,250
- She wasn't my teacher.
- No,she was mine,

562
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:14,740
and you slept with her at school,during
a play,with me probably 20 feet away.

563
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,480
Okay,right.Yeah.Yeah,when
you put it like that... mm.

564
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,970
What?why are you smiling?

565
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,980
I don't know.I am mad,but
that was invigorating.

566
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,890
well,that's good.

567
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:32,080
It's good to know that
you enjoy hitting people.

568
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,850
oh,and look.That's wonderful.

569
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:36,790
I'll be sure to check that out
on bitchslappedagain.Com later.

570
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,050
Let's go get you ice.

571
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,130
This looks great.And you
remembered the egg rolls.

572
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,670
Make sure I only eat a
few.I'm gonna feel guilty.

573
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,630
T likely.

574
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,870
Okay.Enough.What's going on with you?

575
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,120
I'm sorry.I was going to tell you.

576
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,480
Let's just pretend like this ver
ha.Ened that's obviously what you wanted.

577
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,300
That's not fair.

578
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:15,510
No kidding,which is why I didn't show
you some condensed version of my list.

579
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,400
Your list was a dozen people.How much
more condensed could it have been?

580
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,800
13,and I'm not
embarrassed about my past.

581
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,940
No,you're just embarrassed about mine.

582
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,970
When you saw the condensed
version,you told me you were relieved.

583
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:34,050
So... I think we found out everything
we needed to know about each other.

584
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,780
I've been looking for you.

585
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:52,740
About before,what I
forgot to tell you is...

586
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:58,550
I believe in you,too,just...
a different you.

587
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,750
Ladies and gentlemen,may I
have your attention,please?

588
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:08,790
As we celebrate our family's past this
weekend,we also look to its future.

589
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,050
Our grandson,nathaniel,is graduating from
st.Jude's this year,and,I'm proud to announce,

590
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:18,740
has been offered an internship
in the mayor's office.

591
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,690
- Nathaniel?
- I'm sorry.

592
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,900
Well,our fami has many traditions.

593
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,330
Some,like touch football,come
at a steeper price than others.

594
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:46,690
but what they all have in common is commitment
to bringing out the best in yourself,

595
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,720
your potential,even if
you're not sure what that is.

596
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:56,220
I hope to find out... this
summer in the mayor's office.

597
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,780
Yes.That's what I wanted to hear.

598
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,870
How about that?

599
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,860
Call your travel agent,kiddies.

600
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:10,870
Looks like nate archibald traded in a summer
of love for a one-way ticket to his legacy.

601
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,150
You left early.What happened with blair?

602
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,650
chuck?

603
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,290
Okay.Fine.Have fun drinking by yourself.

604
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,400
I'm losing her.

605
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,070
Well,then fight for her.She did for you.

606
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,040
I tried.I failed.

607
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,320
Well,then try again.

608
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,000
She's scared,chuck.

609
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:49,030
Her plan hasn't worked out for her,and
she doesn't know what's gonna happen next.

610
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,750
If you want to be back in
her life,make her feel safe.

611
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,390
You know what to say.

612
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,530
I can't believe you guys broke up.

613
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,370
We didn't exactly break up.

614
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,240
Or maybe we did.I don't know.

615
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,540
I just left.It was bad,whatever it was.

616
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,800
Welcome to the world of
upper east side grandparents.

617
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,010
I've gone up against them myself,and
they're a lot tougher than they look.

618
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,380
So what do I do?

619
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,340
Well... just give him some space.

620
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,940
I mean,he needs time to
work through everything.

621
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,820
okay.

622
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:39,170
Yeah,space is key.

623
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,790
I mean,you guys belong together.

624
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,080
God,I'm hungry.

625
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,120
why do rich people insist on tiny food?

626
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,990
Well,that's how they stay
rich.They only buy small food.

627
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,460
okay,music.

628
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,350
Hey,listen.

629
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,290
It's gonna be okay.

630
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,560
I thought you'd left.

631
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,360
I did.

632
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:14,110
Well,why don't you try it
again?Maybe this time it will take.

633
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:18,240
I made a new list.

634
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:22,820
It's not what you think.

635
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:28,880
Murphy's
2-for-1 fridays?

636
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:36,120
"Romance novels,sonoma
cabernets,christmas tree ornaments"...

637
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,160
that's the only
list I need to know--

638
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:42,490
things that you make you
happy or sad or crazy.

639
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,590
Althou that last one would
be kind of hard to condense.

640
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,790
Just know that
I'm--I'm sorry.

641
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,430
Why?

642
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,520
This whole thing was my fault.

643
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:57,680
I'm the one that wanted to
open the door to the past.

644
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,000
Well,consider it closed.

645
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,250
I don't get it.

646
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:06,220
I mean,I know you were
married for 18 years,

647
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:09,950
but you were the lead singer of
a not entirely unpopular band,

648
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:14,030
and I remember beautiful girls
throwing themselves at you every night.

649
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,230
That's true... but the majority
of that time,I was pining for...

650
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:23,610
a certain blonde photojournalist.

651
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:31,140
Springtime--a season  for
rebirth and new beginnings.

652
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,890
For some,it's a chance 
to turn over a new leaf...

653
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,440
I told doorman no visitors.

654
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:42,230
Mr. Chuck... it's late.

655
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,540
I just need a moment of her time.

656
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,990
Miss blair asleep.

657
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,000
I'm sorry.

658
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:54,280
Can you tell her that I stopped by and
that I have something I need to tell her?

659
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,390
I will,in morning.

660
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,580
thank you for making
sure I got home okay.

661
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,110
You're welcome.

662
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:32,350
I just want to make sure you're
fine,which you are,so... I should go.

663
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,580
Wait.

664
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,640
For others,it's the surprise
 of seeing something bloom.

665
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,720
Stay.
