Gossipirl here... your one and only source

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,160
- into the scandals lives of manhattan's elite.  - Serena,where's Charles?

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,830
- Mom,what's wrong?  - Bart's been in an accident.

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,160
My father was dead because of your father.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,300
My father met with you right before he died.

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,760
- I want to know what you told him that night.  - It's no one's fault.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,930
Yes,it is. It's your fault. His blood is on your hands.

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,660
- I want you to come to Buenos Aires with me.  - I don't want to say no,but I have to.

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,160
- My family is a disaste.  - Are you sure it's your family you don't want to leave?

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,530
- I don't want you to go with him.  - Well,you're too late. I already told him I would.

11
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,860
- Tell him you're not.  -It's not about Aaron. It's about our parents.

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,560
- What about our parents?   - They're in love. I already asked my Mom

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,730
- not to follow her heart once. I'm not gonna do it again.  - Come away with me.

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,860
Let's take that trip we didn't take last year,

15
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,060
- figure things out.  - There's something you need to know.

16
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,900
Just tell me one thing. Was it or boy or a girl?

17
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,230
I will stand by you through anything.

18
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,630
- Why would you do that?  - Because I love you.

19
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,730
Well,that's too bad.

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,830
And who am I?

21
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,100
That's a secret I'll never tell.

22
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,600
You know you love me. X.o.x.o,gossip girl

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,700
Gossip girl here,welcoming you to the new year,

24
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,530
when manhattanites who flew south for the sun

25
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,860
return to their Park Avenue perches,

26
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,100
which means I have a lot of catching up to do.

27
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,700
# oh,oh,oh,oh #

28
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,400
Word is Serena Van Der Woodsen tangoed in the new year

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,430
in the plazas of Buenos Aires.

30
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,360
# oh #

31
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,060
I guess that means lonely boy was all alone

32
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,530
when the clock tolled 12:00. And what of little Jenny?

33
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,660
There it is. Thank God.

34
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,000
Rumor is she's trading one way for whole ways.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,260
All right,Go learn something.

36
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,760
So hello high fashion? Hello,high school.

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,300
So,what did your dad say when you told him

38
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,330
you wanted to go back to Constance?

39
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,830
Ha. Well,it wasn't so much words as a whoop.

40
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,930
No,he actually called Headmistress Queller

41
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,000
at home at night on Christmas Eve.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,430
- Wow. So you know,I still don't understand your sudden flip.  - I don't know. I...

43
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:12,000
I guess it was the Snowflake Ball. I just felt 15 again

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,800
for a second,and felt kind of good. I don't know.

45
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,930
Blair Waldorf has been spotted

46
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,830
making inroads at the Colony Club.

47
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,130
# Don't need to be... #

48
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,100
with high school nearing its end,

49
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,160
has Queen Blair found a new social ladder to climb?

50
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,630
So there's still no words from chuck?

51
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,230
Since the day after the funeral.

52
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,230
- Uncle Jack went to go look for him.  - Wait. Since when do you have an uncle Jack?

53
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,260
It's Bart's younger brother.

54
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,600
He does something for Bass industries in Australia.

55
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,330
Headed and kind of took charge. Somebody had to.

56
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,800
So the only real question remaining

57
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,600
is where in the world is Chuck Bass?

58
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,100
# oh,oh,oh #

59
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,000
And is he ever coming back?

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,860
# ... like you #

61
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,530
- Mm. Dad,- hey.

62
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,730
I was just e-mailing Vanessa. Here. Let me take that.

63
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,700
- Is she still up with her parent?  - Yeah. Yeah,you know,I didn't expect you back

64
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,630
- until this afternoon.  - The search for my sculptor. Hit a dead end.

65
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,130
Second... wait. I thought it was a painter.

66
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,900
Sculptor,painter... uh,he's sort of into mixed media.

67
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,900
Or she. Still not sure about that.

68
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,660
I can't believe you didn't find him or her.

69
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,000
- Hey,it's good to see you  - Hey.

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,230
- Where's your sister?  - Oh,she left for school already.

71
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,160
Mm. Yeah,sigh of relief all around.

72
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,200
- In fact,I should get going myself.  - Why don't I go with you?

73
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,530
- Well,because I'm not a third grader anymore.  - Come on. We can catch up.

74
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,200
Today's the first day of your last semester.

75
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,060
- Allow me trip down nostalgia lane.  - All right,that's fine. But no hugs.

76
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,160
Of course,the Colony Club is

77
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,830
the oldest,most prestigious Ladies' club in the city.

78
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,860
I'm honore just to be considered.

79
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,130
Oh,Miss Blair,they must take you as member.

80
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,760
They must do nothing,Dorota.

81
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,500
It's the Colony Club,the most exclusive club in New York,

82
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,330
which means the world.

83
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,230
Now when the selection committee comes over tomorrow,

84
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,960
things have to be perfect.

85
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,830
It's my first step to building the kind of life I want...

86
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,100
One without...

87
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,660
Mr Chuck?

88
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,730
It's a new year,Dorota...

89
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,830
Time to focus on a new,unencumbered future.

90
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,100
Then again...

91
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,930
Deny one's past is to deny one's self.

92
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:41,600
We'll discuss the party on our way.

93
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,460
- So you really have thought about that,Jenny?  - Yeah?  - Actually you're not nervous to face the mean girls?

94
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,130
Please,Eric. Actually,in the past few months

95
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,100
I have faced Elear Waldorf

96
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,500
and the society gala,I had my society lessons

97
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,160
torched by a crazy model was basially hole,

98
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,600
so high school I can handle it.

99
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,330
Ok,a little nervous.

100
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,100
Jenny,you're really here. I'm so happy when heard you were coming back.

101
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,530
Wow. Um,thanks,Nelly. That's really nice.

102
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,800
Nelly? I think you need your prescription checked.

103
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,930
Do you realize who you're talking to?

104
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,000
And I don't see you holding

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,600
my double tall dry cap with two splendas.

106
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,000
We'll have to punish her.

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,030
Huh.

108
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,500
Is there the ways how they treat you?

109
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,760
Why would you put up with that?

110
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,130
- She's been gone a... a while.  - If I even dreamed

111
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,800
that effecting or try to helping others would make my life hell

112
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,300
or more hell.

113
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,530
I... I better go. I'm glad you're back.

114
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,500
Thanks.

115
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,060
So Nelly Yuki is

116
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,500
the new old Jenny Humphrey.

117
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,830
Hey. Uh,you can't get involved.

118
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,960
I know. It's...

119
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,460
I know.

120
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
Blair.

121
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,000
You came to greet us.

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,460
No you,Jack,Chuck. You said you found him.

123
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,460
In Bangkok. He was staying at our hotel there.

124
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,530
I mean,you hear the term "den of iniquity",

125
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,360
- but until you really see it...  - Do you have him or not?

126
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,860
Nephew mine?

127
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,360
est arrival

128
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,030
Tell his teachers he'll be taking a personal day.

129
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,460
Why are you following me?

130
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,760
Go home and get ready for my party.

131
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes,Miss Blair.

132
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:57,060
- You got me here safe and sound,so...  - Yeah. Uh,l-let's,uh,make a plan for tonight.

133
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,060
I missed you on Christmas and New Year's.

134
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,000
Hold on.

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,960
All right.

136
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,160
- Rufus Humphrey.  - Mr Humphrey,this is Beth

137
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,830
from child services in Dorchester.

138
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,860
- Yeah. Thanks for calling me back.  - Uh... in response to your inquiry,

139
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,700
unfortunately,we don't have any record such an adoption.

140
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,700
I spent the last two weeks striking out

141
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,730
at every adoption agency in Boston,

142
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:21,130
- So I'm not exactly surprised.  - You know,most likely,this was a private adoption.

143
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,000
Your only avenue is to check with the mother,

144
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,600
- the one who gave up the child?  - Yeah,I know. I-I was actually about to do that.

145
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,260
Um,I guess I was just hoping there was another way.

146
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,260
Hey.

147
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,730
Hey. You're back.

148
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,930
Yeah. Just. I literally drove here from the airport.

149
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,130
Well,you look tan.

150
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,200
Well,it is summer in Buenos Aires.

151
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,960
That's right. Southern hemisphere,

152
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,330
- the beauty of a round globe  - I broke up with Aaron.

153
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,800
Oh.

154
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,060
When?

155
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,630
About three hours after we left New York

156
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,530
which was maybe not the brightest idea

157
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,460
on a 15-hour flight.

158
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,630
When I landed,I got an e-mail from Mom

159
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:07,630
saying that she and your dad weren't got be together,

160
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:12,030
- now or ever.  - I know. I tried calling you before you left.

161
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,230
If you knew,you... I... I mean,you know,you could have

162
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,900
called or... or e-mailed.

163
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,760
Of course,unless you didn't want to.

164
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,730
No. I needed to make sure

165
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,560
that when the dust settled,we still felt the same.

166
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,530
And do you?

167
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:30,330
Yes.

168
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,030
Do you?

169
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,100
Spotted... S and lonely boy

170
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,030
kicking off the new year like it's last year.

171
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,930
Who knows,maybe third times as charm.

172
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:51,960
But let's not just break up the bubbly just yet.

173
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,000
B.

174
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh! I missed you so much.

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,160
Not as much as I missed you.

176
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,230
- Hey,did,uh,Jack ever find Chuck?  - Yeah,what was left of him.

177
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,230
I'm surprised they make it through customs.

178
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,260
Chuck's body odor could have given a contact attack

179
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,230
to half of Manhattan.

180
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,560
S,I have to tell you something.

181
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,700
- I did something so stupid.  - B,what is it?

182
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,460
- I told Chuck I loved him.  - Oh,my gosh. That's great.

183
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,000
Great! No! Not only did he say it back,but he disappeared for a month.

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,300
If I could just go back

185
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,830
- and strangle myself as the words come out.  - No,I'm sure Chuck will say it back.

186
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,060
He was probably thinking about you the whole time he was gone.

187
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,100
Not unless I was a Thai hooker named Bo.

188
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,130
- And there's something else.  - Hey.

189
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,400
Oh. Hey. This is my news. When I was in Buenos Aires...

190
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,900
A postcard would have been fine.

191
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,460
I'm really happy for you. I'm gonna go omit now.

192
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,430
- Happy New Year.  - She just needs time.

193
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,430
Mmmm. Hey,listen. I have an idea.

194
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,460
Uh,your have class today,is... is it,

195
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,500
by any chance,incredibly "unmissably" fascinating?

196
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,560
- Why? Do you have something in mind?  - Mm-hmm.

197
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,400
Hello,Rufus.

198
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,000
Lily.

199
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,700
How was your...

200
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,000
I want to know where my child is.

201
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We already talked about that.

202
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,060
Do you realize I had to say "My child"

203
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,930
- because I still don't know if it's a boy or girl?  - I shouldn't have come.

204
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,960
I just spent the last two weeks

205
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
knocking on the door of every adoption agency in Boston,

206
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,960
hoping to avoid this conversation.

207
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,560
But they all told me I had to ask the mother,so I'm asking...

208
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,930
I told you before Christmas. When I gave him up...

209
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,760
- So it's a boy. That's something,I guess.  - I also gave up the right to go looking for him,

210
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,700
and I'm not gonna allow you to bulldoze into his life.

211
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,600
It's not fair.

212
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,030
How is it fair to me? When was I asked if I was okay with it?

213
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,730
'Cause it's just you not wanting anyone to find out.

214
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,330
No. I've given up on that. Charles already knows,

215
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,560
- although I actually believe he won't say anything.  - I have a right to know my son.

216
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,000
And he has the right to his own life,

217
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,730
just like you've had yours.

218
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,500
I was gonna be a rock star,remember?

219
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,560
Instead I had two kids,and I was there to take them

220
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,600
to school every morning and talk about their days at night.

221
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,960
And someone come for me said that I can trade that for the life I wanted when I was 19,I wouldn't.

222
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
Being a father's who I am.

223
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,300
Don't take that away.

224
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,130
I'm sorry. I can't.

225
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,460
Then I'll find him without your help.

226
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,860
# yesrday I was blue #

227
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,530
# I was crying over you #

228
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,860
- They treat her like their servant.  - And it is none of your business.

229
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,830
It's a new year,remember? New leaf,new Jenny Humphrey

230
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah.

231
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,930
Nelly?

232
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,160
Okay,no. That's not okay.

233
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,960
And here we go.

234
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,260
Penelope,can I talk to you for a second?

235
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,960
So I don't mean to intrude on your authority or whatever,

236
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,760
But... could you maybe be a little nicer to Nelly?

237
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760
Sure. Why not?

238
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,130
Really?

239
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,300
We're no monsters,J. Nelly's our friend.

240
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,100
Oh,look at that. Nelly,can you help me...

241
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,360
as a friend?

242
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,930
Oh,not with a napkin. It smudges.

243
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,230
Use your finger.

244
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,560
Okay,no. That's enough.

245
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,630
Nelly,let's go.

246
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,030
Do you know what you're doing,little J?

247
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,930
- I'm not little J anymore.  - Thank you so much.

248
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,860
Just keep walking.

249
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,960
Hazel?

250
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,230
Clean my shoe.

251
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,830
- You wanna get kicked out.  - Hello to you,too,lover. Long time no see.  - Put that out.

252
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,160
- You didn't say the magic word.  - What are you even doing here?

253
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,930
You should be passed out or hooked up to an I.V.

254
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,060
I didn't want to miss the first day of school... It looks like I'm already dead.

255
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,660
- That's only your reason being here? Not because you had something to tell me?  - Like what?

256
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,030
You know like what. Look at me.

257
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,000
Who are you?

258
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,460
Chuck Bass.

259
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:54,700
Please tell me that's not what I think it is.

260
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,630
Oh. Uh...

261
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,600
Hey,dad.

262
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,330
Um,you know Serena was... She was...

263
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,430
We're busted.

264
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,460
Hi,Mr. Humphrey. Happy new year.

265
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,800
Serena. So you two are back together?

266
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,730
Yeah. Right? I mean,we... yea,we are. We're back together.

267
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,360
I think Serena should be getting home.

268
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,600
- What?  - Uh...

269
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,200
No.

270
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,760
I don't like the two of you being here alone when I'm not.

271
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,860
Are you... are you kidding?

272
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,000
Dan,this is my home. I... I would appreciate if you respect that.

273
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,960
Yeah,I... I should go. Um,it's a school night,

274
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,400
and I haven't seen my Mom yet,so...

275
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,600
Okay,yeah. I'll... I'll get you a cab.

276
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,260
Good night,Mr. Humphrey.

277
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm telling you...

278
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,130
This is a mistake.

279
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,860
Miss Waldorf,this is not normal.

280
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,260
Headmistress Queller,

281
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,560
Charles is in no state to represent himself,

282
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,230
and as Mrs. Bass is...

283
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,360
Van Der Woodsen. My father is dead.

284
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,060
Is indisposed with grief.

285
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,560
Someone has to be here,so I am.

286
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,130
Sorry I'm late.

287
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,200
Jack Bass,Chuck's uncle.

288
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,330
How are you?

289
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:13,030
Uncle Jack. What a surprise.

290
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,330
How have you been?

291
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,400
Uh... huh. So you don't remember our rickshaw ride

292
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,660
- down Selon road? The 15-hour flight?  - That was you?

293
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,000
- That was me.  - Thank you,Jack,but I've got this covered.

294
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,460
I figure a principle's office,a boy needs a parent or a guardian when

295
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,730
parents' been dead... sorry,Chuck... I'm the closest thing,

296
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,000
- So what seems to be the problem?  - I found Charles smoking marijuana on school property.

297
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,500
It was hash,actually.

298
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,460
I find it gives a softer high.

299
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,500
Right.

300
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,630
The evidence seems questionable.

301
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,160
Would you stop?

302
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,400
I think we can all agree

303
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,700
that Charles has been through an ordeal.

304
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,300
He's clearly out of his right mind

305
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,430
and can't be held responsible for his actions.

306
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,000
It's temporary insanity.

307
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,230
Headmistress,

308
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,730
no court of law could find him guilty of a crime. How could we?

309
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,060
Mr. Bass has been through a lot.

310
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,030
Do you promise me

311
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,930
that nothing like this will ever happen again?

312
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,460
Pop quiz... What do you get when you cross Chuck Bass,

313
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,830
a billion dollars and Bart cold in the ground?

314
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,030
For you,headmistress...

315
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,230
- Anything.  - Free fall.

316
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,030
Everyone...

317
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,130
It has been a pleasure.

318
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,460
So what kind of suspension are we looking at?

319
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,300
Hey,Dan.

320
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,760
Morning,Jen.

321
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,700
# out on the street #

322
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:03,700
# I heard the march of a million strong #

323
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,560
- Okay. What's with the cold from?  - Nothing. Eat your breakfast.

324
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,200
- Dad doesn't want me dating Serena.  - Wait. What? You guys are back together?

325
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,330
- How did I not know this?  - I'd rather we didn't discuss this right now.

326
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,260
Dad,Serena's,like,the best thing

327
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,300
that's ever happened to Dan. I mean,she's smart,

328
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,200
- she's funny,and she's,like,nine levels hotter than him.  - Thank you. But she's right.

329
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,860
Come on. Get on board. Dan,Serena. Dan,Serena. Whoo!

330
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,100
Okay. Dad is not into cheering.

331
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,230
And I really supposed to pretend like this has nothing to do

332
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,300
with what happened between you and Lily before Christmas?

333
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,660
- What happened between you and Lily?  - It's none of your business.

334
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,330
Oh,so you can tell me not to date Serena,

335
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,830
- but I can'say anything about you and Lily?  - Him and Lily what? Somebody,please.

336
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,100
- I think you need to leave for school.  - Oh,you're not gonna walk me today?

337
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,300
I'm heartbroken.

338
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,730
Okay,dad. Seriously?

339
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,630
- You're gonna be late.  - No,I'm not.

340
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,700
Yes,I am.

341
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,960
Dan,wait up.

342
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,960
Nelly has put in a full year of loyal service.

343
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,160
She should be allowed to leave without reprisals.

344
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,030
For example,people breaking into her locker

345
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,460
and smashing her glasses.

346
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,130
I see. Rebuttal?

347
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,200
First,there has been a long tradition

348
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,930
of new members being subjected to more... attention,

349
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,430
Some of the things I had to do? Disgusting.

350
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,300
Oh,I remember. I made you do them.

351
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,560
But more importantly,once people find out you can quit,

352
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,400
the girls at the steps will be finished.

353
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,560
Come on,Blair. What's your decision?

354
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,600
Tonight I'm hosting the selection committee

355
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,800
- of the Colony Club.  - You're getting into the Colony Club?

356
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,060
They never take girls from high school.

357
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,700
I know. I was surprised,too. That's not entirely true.

358
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,130
The point is,enough of this high school nonsense.

359
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,700
Nelly or no Nelly,who cares?

360
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,330
I have enough going on already.

361
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,130
God!

362
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,200
Blair's leaving us behind.

363
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,430
It's like the end of an area.

364
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,660
We're more than only one member,

365
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,700
and the only way Nelly is leaving is in a body bag.

366
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,100
God,P,tone down the crazy.

367
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,160
When I left for Argeina,my Mom acted like she and your dad

368
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,130
were riding off into the sunset together,

369
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,160
then three hours later,he tells you it's over.

370
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,200
We were so happy for ourselves.

371
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,300
We... we never asked what happened between them.

372
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,860
- And so... so what do we do?  - I don't know,but we have to do something,Dan.

373
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,130
I need to talk to you.

374
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,100
Yeah,I'm... I'll see you later.

375
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,030
- Have you seen Chuck today?  - No. Why?

376
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:42,030
- Did he come home last night?  - No,Blair,I don't know. What's wrong?

377
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:46,000
Yesterday Queller caught him smoking hash at school.

378
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,500
There was a meeting,

379
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,530
and to say it went badly would be an understatement.

380
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,480
I'm worried.

381
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,130
Blair,it's Chuck.

382
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,300
He's somewhere blowing off steam. It's what he do.

383
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,360
He'll show up in couple days.

384
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,700
Minus a few million brain cells and some ler tissue.

385
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,800
That's true.

386
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,730
He always disappeared.

387
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,630
Marrakech,Prague.

388
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,930
And he always came back,

389
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,860
tie perfectly knotted.

390
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,360
But this time,

391
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,000
when I looked in his eye...

392
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,830
I couldn't see him anymore.

393
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,130
You're really worried.

394
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:29,030
Okay,um,okay. Uh,just give until tonight.

395
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,100
And if he hasn't shown up,we'll help you.

396
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,960
I gotta get to class. I'm sorry.

397
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:51,430
Dorota,is everything ready for the colony ladies?

398
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,860
No,not yet. I have somewhere to go first.

399
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,060
- Ow. Watch it!  - Sorry.

400
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,060
Oh,my god.

401
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:06,530
They've got our table.

402
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,860
- Here they come.  - Just let me do the talking.

403
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,960
- I think I'm gonna be sick.  - Yeah,try no to do that.

404
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,160
Isabel's gonna count to three.

405
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,930
If you've not vanished by then,I will not be responsible.

406
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,960
One...

407
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,060
Actually,I'd grab a table. They're filling up pretty fast.

408
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,000
Sit anywhere,guys. The tables belong everyone.

409
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,830
Two?

410
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,730
You're gonna pay for this,Jenny Humphrey. I promise.

411
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,800
You will pay.

412
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,760
So should I keep counting?

413
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,730
Oh,shut up,is.

414
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,130
Daddy? I need you to call Headmistress Queller.

415
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,500
There's a girl bullying me.

416
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,430
# I thought you put me in rapture #

417
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,100
# I never asked you to dump her #

418
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,700
# I thought you knew we'd have a high life #

419
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,600
# ba dubba ba dubba #

420
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,960
# still I see your philosophy #

421
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,560
# falling through my tainted mind #

422
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,660
# would you dig my dirt? 'cause I'm so desolate #

423
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,230
Hello,Chuck.

424
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,560
I thought I'd find you here.

425
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,930
Blair.

426
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,060
Ladies,could you give us a moment?

427
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,930
Well,I thought you sold this place.

428
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,860
I bought it back last night. Owner took me to the cleaners,

429
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,860
But some things are worth the price.

430
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:45,830
You should go home. Lily,Serena,Eric...

431
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,400
That's not my home or my family.

432
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,000
Fine. Go to the Palace.

433
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,030
Just get out of here.

434
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,230
Well,that would be rude.

435
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,300
Since I'm throwing a party here tonight.

436
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,330
I just posted it on "gossip girl".

437
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,630
Maybe you'll grace us with a dance.

438
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,200
Chuck,stop.

439
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,800
All this doesn't help. It isn't you.

440
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,060
Wrong.

441
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,060
Bart may have been a bastard,

442
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,860
But he saw me better than anyone.

443
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,960
I'm simply living up to my poteial.

444
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:21,160
It's time to let go of your fantasies.

445
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,760
I don't believe you.

446
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,430
That's your business.

447
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,460
Now is that it,

448
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,400
or were you going to tell me you love me again?

449
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,900
Why did you even come back?

450
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,330
Dad?

451
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,930
Dad?

452
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,460
So what are we looking for again?

453
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:58,230
Ah,notes,messages,anything that seems tied to my mom.

454
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,160
I don't... I don't see why I had to come.

455
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,260
He doesn't want me here.

456
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,700
I figure he's less likely to murder me with witnesses.

457
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,960
Yes. That makes sense.

458
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,930
Oh,my god.

459
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,630
He asked my mom to marry him,and she said no.

460
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,760
- That's why he's angry.  - Yeah,that's my mom's ring.

461
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,100
She gave it back to him before Christmas.

462
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,630
- It was a... It was a good theory,though.  - Oh.

463
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,600
Oh.

464
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,360
It's Blair. She... she needs me. I have to go.

465
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,360
Call me If you find something.

466
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,760
And what if he tries to kill me?

467
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,330
Soh Boston adoption agency.

468
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,530
New year,

469
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,500
but same old story.

470
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,100
The darkest secrets

471
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,600
are always the ones that is closest to home.

472
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,230
Hello?

473
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,500
Miss Blair,where have you been?

474
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,300
The colony club ladies will be here.

475
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,800
I just need ten minutes.

476
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,260
- What happened?  - Penepe and the girls

477
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,130
got their parents to call Queller.

478
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,960
They say I'm bullying them.

479
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,860
Wow. Oh,my god,I... that... that is kind of genius.

480
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,860
She wants me try to handle it by myself,

481
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,830
Which basically means,roll over and take it.

482
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,260
I don't even understand.

483
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:00,600
- Why wouldn't Penelope just let you quit?

484
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,600
- She's probably afraid I will tell people that

485
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:26,530
she slept with her Dad's new partner. I mean,the things I know...

486
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,100
No. Penelope would kill me... literally

487
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,700
Yeah. We'll see.

488
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,030
How much do you know?

489
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,530
- Dan,if you're here To argue...  - What were you looking for in Boston?

490
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,800
I... I know it's not a painter and I know it's not a sculptor,

491
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,260
Or... or whatever story it was you couldn't keep straight.

492
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,830
H... hold on. How do...

493
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,230
Uh,did,uh,Chuck Bass say something to you?

494
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,730
Chuck ba... what?

495
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,700
Wh... so wait,Y... you're telling me

496
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,200
that Chuck Bass knows something about our life,

497
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,900
And I don't know?

498
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,460
I can't talk to you about this right now.

499
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,430
You know,if it was just Your life,I would say fine.

500
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,030
But it's not. It's... it's mine and it's serena's.

501
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,330
- I think we have A right to know.  - I agree,but there are other people involved.

502
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,800
- Let me take a wild guess,and say Lily.  - Just give me a day.

503
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,000
- There's a right way for all of us to talk about this.  - Yeah. Well,We're... we're past that.

504
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,100
Hey,B,is everything okay? I came as fast as I could.

505
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,400
Fine. False alarm.

506
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,900
Wait,what happened?

507
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,430
Chuck.

508
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,530
He's holed up at Victrola

509
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,730
In some Jim Morrison Downward Spiral.

510
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,530
Sad in a way. Luckily,it's not my concern.

511
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,130
Thank you for coming.

512
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,600
Dorota! I think my guests from the colony club are here!

513
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,500
Wait,if Chuck is really in trouble,

514
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,430
Then we need to help him.

515
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,560
He doesn't have any brothers and sisters.

516
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,900
- We are all he has,you are I he has.  - He doesn't want my help.

517
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,130
- Oh,hello.  - Please take my jacket.  - So that's just it?

518
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,130
You're gonna abandon him for a bunch of society matrons?

519
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,330
Those matrons,as you call them,Are helping me bui a life.

520
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,930
All Chuck can do is destroy one.

521
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,760
I'm not abandoning Chuck. I'm just saving myself.

522
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,660
Now if you'll excuse me...

523
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:19,000
Hi,ladies. Glad you could make it. Come on in.

524
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,660
# I ebb and... #

525
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,030
# you flow #

526
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,160
# It's a bit screwed #

527
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,630
# But you can't cat my love #

528
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,430
That's the problem with an open invitation.

529
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,960
You can't keep out The hoi polloi.

530
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,260
What do you know about my dad and Lily?

531
00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:00,960
So the cat's out of the bag. I found some numbers.

532
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,700
My... my dad was supposed to in Boston looking for an artist.

533
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,760
He was,uh... Apparently visiting some orphanages.

534
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,630
How dickensian.

535
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,230
Chuck,I need to know this.

536
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,830
You know the funny thing is I was going to keep Lily's secret.

537
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,230
You buried he arson story on my dad.

538
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,100
This makes us even.

539
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,000
You're not The first-born Humphrey,

540
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,700
So if you were planning On inheriting the family estate,

541
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,330
I'd make other arrangements.

542
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,400
Um... that... that... that's not possible.

543
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,860
I mean,my dad... Lily and her mother kept it a secret,

544
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,800
Gave the kid away.

545
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,660
I imagine your dad just found out

546
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,460
# these stars are... #

547
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:55,060
And now there's only one more person to tell.

548
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:58,530
Of course,as soon as you do,It's over between you,isn't it?

549
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,900
Sharing a sibling?

550
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,530
It's a bit much,Even for me.

551
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,700
Spotted at the Victrola...  lonelboy  and Chuck Bass

552
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,300
having a heart-to-heart. What or who do they have to talk about

553
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,730
And Serena will be the last to know

554
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,400
I've always felt

555
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,860
The colony club exemplified the highest ideals of character.

556
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,600
Public service...

557
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,860
I frequently feed a ducks in central park.

558
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,000
And read to blind children.

559
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,600
Impressive.

560
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,600
However,for better or worse,

561
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,230
We are known by the company we keep.

562
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,600
Tell me,

563
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,260
Was that Serena Van Der Woodsen who came earlier?

564
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,900
Yes. She's an old friend.

565
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,360
I see her quite a bit on page six.

566
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,860
And... Quite a bit of her.

567
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,200
Well,when I said she was an old friend,

568
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,030
It was... Habit.

569
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,760
I don't...

570
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,230
Can't approve of how she lives her life.

571
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,830
hmm. mm.

572
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,060
And her mother married Bart Bass.

573
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,760
The man was all new money and models.

574
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,030
If you ask me,that car hitting him was a mercy killing.

575
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:13,060
I hear Bass junior is a piece of work.

576
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,530
You wouldn't have anything to do with him,would you?

577
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,660
Well,I...

578
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:20,030
Blair,the answer is " no ".

579
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,200
Yes. I mean,no.

580
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,600
I have to go.

581
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,230
That " piece of work "... Chuck Bass... needs me.

582
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,530
And Serena and her mother are wonderful,kind people.

583
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,460
Blair...

584
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,460
Do you know what you're doing?

585
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:48,700
I thought I was Leaving high school behind.

586
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,400
I guess you never do.

587
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,960
Dorota will get your coats.

588
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,500
# When I focus,I never me #

589
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,700
# It starts with a kiss #  # la la la,la la la #

590
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,860
# She ricochets #

591
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:16,430
# She's in your head #

592
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,230
# And you just don't notice #

593
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,900
# She ricochets #

594
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,500
# And you don't notice #

595
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,360
Welcome back.

596
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,200
How was Thailand?

597
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,300
I honestly don't remember.

598
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,560
You should come home,Chuck.

599
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,530
# Notice,notice,notice,notice,notice #

600
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,200
# Notice,notice,notice,notice,notice,notice #

601
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,000
I think I'll take the view from above.

602
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,430
It was nice having you as my little brother.

603
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,700
Eric,where's little J?

604
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,660
I imagine busy cleaning out her locker.

605
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:17,730
Actually...

606
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,360
I just got the writing a "gossip girl" post,

607
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:23,000
Saying how,Penelope,for the past six months,

608
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,260
You've been having an affair with your dad's junior partner.

609
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,300
And,Hazel... you got drunk

610
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,160
- And hooked up with your cousin... Twice.  - Oh,my god.

611
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,800
And,Isabel...

612
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,560
- Do I even have to say?  - No.

613
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:38,300
- Those things were told to you in confidence!  - No,more like stupidity.

614
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,460
And unless you get your parents to back off

615
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:44,800
- And you start leaving Nelly alone,I hit "send".  - Duh,you win.

616
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,230
I know.

617
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,130
So what are you gonna do about the collegiate party tomorrow?

618
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,360
What? What are you talking about?

619
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,360
Don't play the innocent. You wanna queen,you've got it.

620
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:59,330
- Wait. That's what You think I did all this for?  - Didn't you?

621
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,530
No,no,not at all.

622
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,930
You're telling me this just a good deed?

623
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,930
Oh,my god. I'm so bored.

624
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,030
O... kay. Big makes calculation.

625
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,030
You see,I can not stop coming back to school,you did wanna be queen.

626
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:15,910
Oh,that's no good.

627
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,910
And I was never got move pass Hazel on ass,maybe there's a new reshain...

628
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,850
Wait,you played me?

629
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,630
You... Nelly Yuki? And now she wants to go to the collegiate party.

630
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,500
I'm sorry,Jenny.

631
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,730
Penelope!

632
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,230
Really though?

633
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,600
Wow.

634
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:37,430
So everything... Is exactly the same. Nothing changed.

635
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,800
Everything but you.

636
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,960
Okay. Hot chocolate?

637
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,330
- Let meet my coat.  - Yeah.

638
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,830
Rufus. Your message said it was urgent. Has something happened?

639
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,260
Dan knows,or... He doesn't yet,

640
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,330
But I think he will soon.

641
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,430
And then I imagine he'll tell Serena,

642
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,900
And... I thought you should know.

643
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,430
Rufus,wait.

644
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,700
What will they think of me?

645
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,200
Who,Serena and Eric?

646
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,100
Well,it not my problem. We're each on our own,remember?

647
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,060
Look,you already hate me. What if they hate me,too?

648
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,860
I gave away their... their brother.

649
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,560
I wasn't ready.

650
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,460
I was young and scared...

651
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,700
heartbroken over you.

652
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,300
And Cice kept pressuring me.

653
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,660
But the truth is,I wasn't ready to have a baby.

654
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,030
And it's been a hole in my life ever since.

655
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,700
I understand

656
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,660
Why you give him up.

657
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,000
But it's that you didn't tell me.

658
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,060
Oh,Rufus,please...

659
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,500
I don't hate you,Lil...

660
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,600
As much as I want to.

661
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,630
Neither will your kids.

662
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,230
But you've had 20 years to make peace with this.

663
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,400
It's gonna take me some time.

664
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:07,200
What do you wanna know?

665
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,400
Hey.

666
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,230
Hey. What are you doing here?

667
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,300
- Uh,really enough,I came to see Chuck.  - Me,too.

668
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,760
Is everything okay? Did you find something in the loft?

669
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:30,830
Kind of. Uh,can we... can we go to... somewhere to talk...

670
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,030
- Privately,without all of... this?  - Okay.

671
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,200
Blair!

672
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,230
- Aren't you a little old to be here?  - Hmm?

673
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,130
I heard my nephew is throwing the first big party of the year.

674
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,960
And I have to say,he does the Bass name proud.

675
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,800
I can see you've been a wonderful influence on him.

676
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,130
- Oh,hey,Eric. Have you seen Chuck?  - Uh,a while ago.

677
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,060
He said something about wanting to take in the view from above.

678
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,700
He probably aren't upstairs.

679
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,930
Clearly,you don't know Chuck. He has a thing for rooftops.

680
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,730
# Farewell #

681
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,600
# and adieu #

682
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,830
# to you #

683
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,860
# Spanish ladies #

684
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,300
# Farewell #

685
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,400
# to you #

686
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,860
One thing about being on top of the world...

687
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,600
it gives you a long,long way to fall.

688
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,160
Oops.

689
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,930
Chuck!

690
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,500
No!

691
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,300
God,you idiot! You don't surprise someone

692
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,300
- standing off the edge of a building!  - Chuck,come away from there.

693
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,260
Let's go down and join the party.

694
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:56,330
I was at the party. I'm not really that into it.

695
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,630
- Chuck,your father wouldn't have wanted this.  - Dear old dad.

696
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,260
Unfortunately,all I know is what he didn't want...

697
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,830
Which was me.

698
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,900
I'm Chuck Bass!

699
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,930
No one cares.

700
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,030
I do.

701
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,960
Don't you understand?

702
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,860
I'll always be here.

703
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,560
I don't want you going anywhere.

704
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,300
I couldn't bear it.

705
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,200
So whatever you want to do to yourself,

706
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,700
Please don't do that to me.

707
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,060
Please.

708
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,230
Please.

709
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,230
I'm sorry.

710
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,430
It's okay.

711
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:21,330
Hey,what... whatever it is,you can tell me.

712
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,560
No,yeah,I... I know. But it's...

713
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,500
Oh,it's ok.

714
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,260
Just...

715
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,300
Yeah,dad,what's going on?

716
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,300
Do you know?

717
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,130
Yeah,I do.

718
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,760
Have you told Serena?

719
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,200
Well,I was... I was about to.

720
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,400
I'm with Lily. We're about to go look for our child.

721
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,330
- Dad  -Lily wants to tell Serena and Eric herself.

722
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,330
Dad,no,I can't... you can't ask me to hide this from Serena.

723
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,830
This is too big to keep secret.

724
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,760
Son,this isn't your secret to share.

725
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,830
This is between mother and daughter.

726
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,900
I know it's hard,but you have to respect that.

727
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,500
Yeah. Okay.

728
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,100
Thanks,son. I'll call you soon.

729
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,800
He should go back to Lily's.

730
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,700
He'll just take off again

731
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,020
I've got a better chance keeping an eye on him.

732
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,530
So you know,I don't trust you.

733
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,000
All I want is what's best for my nephew.

734
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,090
So you trust me is the really your best choice.

735
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,330
He can't know what happened on New Year's.

736
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,900
Good night,Blair.

737
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,260
Ah,me. The year's scarcely turned,

738
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:45,030
and already the secrets have begun.

739
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,500
Where will it end this time?

740
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,130
What is it?

741
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,230
Uh,it's... that was my dad.

742
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,400
Uh,he... he and Lily are going away for a couple days.

743
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,030
An... and you're worried what'll happen to us.

744
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,300
Hey.

745
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:05,400
It's fine. We're gonna be okay.

746
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,660
The new year isn't about what happened

747
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,560
It's about what's to come.

748
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,800
But the past is always with us,

749
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,860
just waiting to mess with the present

750
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:45,330
and when it does,I'll be watching.

751
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,630
