Jenny, us hanging out
was just as friends.

00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:13,012
That was my mother,
and she is at Canyon Ranch.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,348
You should go.

6
00:00:14,943 --> 00:00:16,807
- Elliot.
- How'd you know where I lived

7
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,477
I started on the first
floor and worked my way up.

8
00:00:20,095 --> 00:00:22,563
- Will you...
- Yes, of course I will marry you!

9
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,285
I told Chuck I'd take
either you or the hotel.

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,114
He chose to give me you.

11
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,861
I did what I had to to win.

12
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,738
Even if it means losing me instead?

13
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,823
You went up there on your own.

14
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,367
Good-bye, Chuck.

You're not gonna find
anything in there.

28
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,298
Luckily for me,
I own a bar downstairs.

29
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,150
Drink this.

30
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:35,154
We know this has to do with whatever's
going on between you and Blair.

31
00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:37,474
Okay, you got the Empire back.

32
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,284
You two should be celebrating,
not fighting.

33
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,036
You wanna tell us what's going on?

34
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:43,233
Here.

35
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:49,885
I thought our relationship...

36
00:02:50,987 --> 00:02:54,381
Could withstand anything.
Apparently, I was wrong.

37
00:02:57,299 --> 00:02:59,178
Well, you still love her, don't you?

38
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,685
Then show her that you're sorry.

39
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,128
Take her to Blue Hill upstate
or buy her those Louboutins at Saks.

40
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:07,350
I'll buy Saks itself,
that still wouldn't be enough.

41
00:03:07,475 --> 00:03:10,175
She doesn't want to talk to me.
I've tried.

42
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,192
- When?
- You haven't been outside in days.

43
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,777
She asked me to leave her alone.

44
00:03:15,686 --> 00:03:19,436
You don't want to wait too long,
or she'll think you don't care.

45
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,158
Excuse me.

46
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:30,209
You think it worked?

47
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,461
Well, maybe you'll have
better luck with Blair.

48
00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:35,901
Wait. What? You're
making me do this alone?

49
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,749
Breakfast with the Humphreys,
remember?

50
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:41,174
Let me know how it goes.
Good luck.

51
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,164
Hello? Hello?

52
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:58,529
What on Earth is going on?

53
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,906
I am sorry, Miss Eleanor, Mr. Cyrus.

54
00:04:01,697 --> 00:04:03,007
That was my mother.

55
00:04:03,132 --> 00:04:05,411
She come with father
to New York on Monday.

56
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,862
But that's wonderful. I
can't wait to meet them.

57
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,382
Maybe we can all go have

58
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:14,170
the vodka flight
at the Russian Samovar!

59
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,297
We go nowhere once they see me.

60
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,355
My parents don't know I pregnant.

61
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,760
And since I not married,
they will disown me.

62
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:25,347
Or worse, they will kidnap
and take back to old country.

63
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:30,686
- Nate!
- Hello, Nathaniel.

64
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,147
- I'm here to see the invalid.
- And not a moment too soon.

65
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:36,525
She hasn't left her room for days.
It'slike living with Howard Hughes.

66
00:04:37,462 --> 00:04:40,183
Blair is upstairs. I hope you
can make some headway with her.

67
00:04:40,308 --> 00:04:42,159
I am not allowed to
cross the transom.

68
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:43,884
Well, I'll do my best.

69
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,250
Great. He sent good cop.

70
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,629
Chuck didn't send me.

71
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,890
Serena.

72
00:05:01,112 --> 00:05:03,469
Look, we're concerned
about our best friends.

73
00:05:05,175 --> 00:05:07,195
And whatever he did,

74
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,391
I'm sure you can find
a suitable punishment for him.

75
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:12,728
There is no punishment
for what he did.

76
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:14,541
You're Blair Waldorf.

77
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,049
"Punishment" is your middle name.

78
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:21,904
Just tell me what happened.

79
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:25,112
I can't tell anyone.

80
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:27,168
It's too awful.

81
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,996
There's no such thing as
"too awful" between friends.

82
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,914
We don't judge, remember?

83
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,417
And we can forgive anything.

84
00:05:41,234 --> 00:05:43,258
You can't tell anyone,
especially not Serena.

85
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,931
Not a soul. I promise.

86
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:50,724
What did Chuck tell you about
how he got his hotel back?

87
00:05:51,929 --> 00:05:55,236
He didn't. He just said
"money solves everything."

88
00:05:58,053 --> 00:05:59,964
He didn't use money.

89
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:02,403
He used me, as a trade.

90
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,656
Come on. No way.

91
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:09,724
He set me up to sleep with Jack
in exchange for his beloved Empire.

92
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:15,874
So now do you see why
I couldn't tell anyone?

93
00:06:20,843 --> 00:06:21,893
Oh, my God.

94
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:34,184
My Slavic language
skills are a little rusty,

95
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,646
but I'm pretty sure she just
said, "over my dead goat."

96
00:06:39,214 --> 00:06:42,526
Or "body." The words
are very similar.

97
00:06:43,697 --> 00:06:45,029
Come away from there.

98
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:48,365
Eavesdropping on
the help is undignified.

99
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,390
Plus, it confuses them.

100
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:53,076
I haven't heard that much
overwrought Polish drama

101
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:56,832
since I canceled my B.A.M.
subscription. What is going on?

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,558
From what I can gather,
Dorota's in a bind.

103
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:03,630
She needs to be married before
her parents show up on Monday.

104
00:07:05,796 --> 00:07:07,518
Dorota, I don't understand this.

105
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:11,138
Why can't you and Vanya
just go down to City Hall?

106
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:14,349
Never. First marriage
happen at Polish City Hall.

107
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,768
You were married before?

108
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:18,520
Yes. I am divorce.

109
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,061
And one reason is because

110
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:23,025
first wedding happen
at City Hall, ignoring tradition.

111
00:07:23,913 --> 00:07:26,737
Wedding traditions very
sacred in my country.

112
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,281
Dorota, don't be foolish.

113
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,701
Every marriage I know fail
if wedding has no tradition.

114
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:36,417
Where did you and
Mr. Harold get married?

115
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:39,708
I don't think that's the reason
the marriage didn't work out.

116
00:07:40,095 --> 00:07:42,245
This not way it's supposed to be.

117
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:46,090
Miss Blair and I talk about what
wedding with Vanya will be like.

118
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,841
It's supposed to be big,

119
00:07:48,412 --> 00:07:51,043
grand, perfect.

120
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:53,180
Blair does love herself a wedding.

121
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,599
If I may interject...

122
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,588
Thank you for keeping my secret.

123
00:07:58,713 --> 00:08:01,161
No problem. I'm just gonna tell
Serena to hold off

124
00:08:01,286 --> 00:08:04,086
- on the interrogation of you and...
- Chuck.

125
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:10,948
Miss Blair, I am getting married!

126
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,373
- Of course you are.
- I mean tomorrow.

127
00:08:13,498 --> 00:08:17,335
Mr. Chuck is throwing us
traditional Polish/Russian wedding.

128
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,374
- He said you two back together...
- He did?

129
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,460
Which is best news ever.
Traditional wedding must have

130
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,296
happy couple who escort
bride and groom into chapel.

131
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,382
Is necessary for good
luck in marriage.

132
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:33,178
Please, Miss Blair,

133
00:08:34,363 --> 00:08:35,597
Mr. Chuck,

134
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,475
will you be happy
couple for Vanya and me?

135
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:41,674
I can't speak for Blair,

136
00:08:43,027 --> 00:08:45,227
but it would be my great pleasure.

137
00:08:49,073 --> 00:08:50,913
<i>Poor B. just realized </i>

138
00:08:51,038 --> 00:08:54,616
<i>that Chuck will do anything
to keep the flame alive.</i>

139
00:08:57,672 --> 00:08:59,022
Hello, beautiful.

140
00:09:00,326 --> 00:09:01,526
Glad you came.

141
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:05,627
<i>As for Serena, looks like
she's playing with fire.</i>

142
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,229
These venues will not do.
I know I said...

143
00:09:16,354 --> 00:09:19,413
traditional, but...
bing it.

144
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:22,627
Have you ever checked out
the Astoria World Manor?

145
00:09:22,752 --> 00:09:25,545
It's Queens' answer to the
grand ballroom at the Plaza.

146
00:09:26,796 --> 00:09:27,983
Thank you, Charles.

147
00:09:29,868 --> 00:09:31,425
You didn't know about that?

148
00:09:34,318 --> 00:09:35,772
You look like you need a task.

149
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,603
What I need is a zofran.

150
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:40,827
All this disingenuous generosity
is making me want to vomit.

151
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,495
There's nothing disingenuous.

152
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,466
I'm happy I can give Dorota and Vanya
the dream wedding that they deserve.

153
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:49,819
The only reason you're giving it is
so that you can spend time with me.

154
00:09:49,944 --> 00:09:52,799
- You know weddings are my weakness.
- Really? It never occurred to me.

155
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:54,885
Everything occurs to you, Chuck.

156
00:09:58,148 --> 00:10:00,432
You and I are magnetic.

157
00:10:00,849 --> 00:10:02,057
You can feel it.

158
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,063
Our pull is as undeniable as ever.

159
00:10:08,076 --> 00:10:10,602
- It's different this time.
- It doesn't have to be.

160
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,361
I love you.

161
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,907
Saying it was hard, but I did,
and I've never looked back.

162
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,980
So now I'm asking you,

163
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,866
please do this for me.

164
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:25,207
Forgive me.

165
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,211
I'm sorry. I can't.

166
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,853
Yes! Thank God you're here. I need help
with the flowers.

167
00:10:40,978 --> 00:10:42,452
No, I wish I was kidding.

168
00:10:42,577 --> 00:10:44,852
I'm no florist, but I've received
enough flowers 

169
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,806
to know a thing or two.
I'm all yours.

170
00:10:46,931 --> 00:10:48,883
- Croissant?
- I'm starved.

171
00:10:49,008 --> 00:10:50,691
Was Rufus' waffle iron broken?

172
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:54,100
No, but this is gonna be a long day.

173
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,116
Show me those flower choices.

174
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,750
Okay, so my Tisch application
is in the mail, Vanessa's out of town,

175
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,374
and I just ate
about 5 pounds of Bisquick.

176
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:08,050
Food coma film festival?
Who's with me on the couch?

177
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:10,527
I'm thinking Kieslowski's
<i>Double Life of Veronique</i>.

178
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:14,537
You're in luck. We just scored front-row
seats to a Polish production in live.

179
00:11:14,662 --> 00:11:16,758
Vanya and Dorota are getting married,
they asked me

180
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,759
to throw them a traditional
eastern European game night

181
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,748
whatever that means. Eleanor asked if
you and your sewing machine were free.

182
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,589
- Already on my way.
- I'm gonna come with you.

183
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,967
Is it to help me sew
or to stalk your new crush?

184
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,721
- It's not stalking if you know him.
- Who's the lucky guy?

185
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:32,892
His name is Elliot.

186
00:11:33,344 --> 00:11:34,776
I met him during Nate's party.

187
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,727
We've been texting, but I don't know
if he's being flirty or friendly, so...

188
00:11:37,852 --> 00:11:40,613
Yeah, Eric refuses to ask him out
until he knows if he's gay or not.

189
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,396
It could be totally embarrassing

190
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,911
if I assume one thing
and he actually means another.

191
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,800
Come on, stalker.

192
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:52,403
It's too bad
Lily's gonna miss the party.

193
00:11:53,273 --> 00:11:54,460
And the wedding.

194
00:11:56,185 --> 00:11:59,716
You could ask her to come back early.
How many massages can one person get?

195
00:11:59,841 --> 00:12:02,669
This is Cece and Lily
we're talking about. Cece needs her.

196
00:12:03,084 --> 00:12:04,180
So do you.

197
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:07,090
Just ask her to come home,
be your date.

198
00:12:07,215 --> 00:12:08,435
It'll be romantic.

199
00:12:14,396 --> 00:12:17,467
Heading to the florist? You chose
the calla lilies or the casablancas?

200
00:12:19,295 --> 00:12:21,698
You know what, Chuck?
Don't even bother.

201
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,033
I know what you did.

202
00:12:23,933 --> 00:12:25,700
- Blair told you.
- Yeah, she did.

203
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,410
She didn't want to, but she did.

204
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,862
This time you have crossed a line.

205
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,845
In your rush to pass judgment,

206
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,461
did you ever consider
you don't know the entire truth?

207
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:37,954
What exactly did Blair say?

208
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,966
That you traded her for the hotel.

209
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:45,545
No, you deserve to be alone.

210
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,433
I may be heartless,
but you're naive.

211
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,091
I made the deal, sure,

212
00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:54,929
but Blair didn't know that
when she went to Jack.

213
00:12:55,273 --> 00:12:57,140
I guess she left that part out.

214
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:01,534
I can feel
your brain strain, Nathaniel.

215
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:04,825
I don't expect you to understand.

216
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,411
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You and Serena have it easy.

217
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,288
Until now your biggest concern
is whose hair is shinier.

218
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,917
Did she tell you where
she was this morning?

219
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:17,773
She went to breakfast at the Humphreys'.
What does it matter?

220
00:13:18,707 --> 00:13:20,841
Did she tell you
Carter Baizen's back in town?

221
00:13:22,407 --> 00:13:24,274
Because my friend
at the St. Regis did,

222
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,754
and guess who he saw
with Carter this morning.

223
00:13:28,573 --> 00:13:31,059
No, you have no idea
what you're even talking about.

224
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,979
No, you have no idea what I'm
talking about, and that's the problem.

225
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:37,732
If you'll excuse me,
I was heading out.

226
00:13:50,016 --> 00:13:52,112
What are you doing hiding up here?

227
00:13:52,438 --> 00:13:53,790
I needed to be alone.

228
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:58,685
I know you and Chuck are going
through a hard time right now,

229
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:01,671
but don't you at least think
what he did was romantic?

230
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:06,303
This was your idea.

231
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,245
No. I may have encouraged him
to make a gesture,

232
00:14:10,052 --> 00:14:11,892
but throwing a whole wedding
was his idea.

233
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,186
That's the thing with him,
S. everything is a game.

234
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,924
But that's what makes
you guys so good together.

235
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:20,609
You love games. It's who you are.

236
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,111
The last game we played,
we both lost.

237
00:14:27,376 --> 00:14:28,614
You and Nate are lucky.

238
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:30,619
You're so good to each other.

239
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,984
No games, no lies,

240
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,788
no secrets, just pure honesty...

241
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,755
that's how it's supposed to be.

242
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:40,170
I know that now.

243
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,673
How do you do it?

244
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,030
You just do, I guess.

245
00:14:50,036 --> 00:14:51,816
I hope it all works out.

246
00:14:59,755 --> 00:15:00,982
What are you doing here?

247
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,026
I'm just dropping something off
to Serena.

248
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,160
How about you stay away
from my girlfriend?

249
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,462
What do you want from her?

250
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:10,822
She's the one who wants something,

251
00:15:10,947 --> 00:15:13,189
and it looks like I'm the only one
who can give it to her.

252
00:15:13,314 --> 00:15:15,372
I guess she hasn't told
you what that is, huh?

253
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:18,197
What can I say?
She trusts me more than you.

254
00:15:19,505 --> 00:15:22,741
I gotta run, but if you need
anything, I'll be at the St. Regis.

255
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:24,339
Of course, Serena already knows.

256
00:15:27,872 --> 00:15:29,592
Was that who I think it was?

257
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:32,295
Was Serena at breakfast
with you guys this morning?

258
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,769
Why? Did she say she was?

259
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:48,561
I found the perfect gift
for Dorota and Vanya.

260
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:50,916
It's gonna knock your socks off!

261
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,699
- That's wonderful, dear.
- So much to do!

262
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:55,909
- Finally, Jenny.
- Hi.

263
00:15:56,034 --> 00:15:59,291
- Did you get the silk netting?
- Enough to make Monique Lhuillier weep.

264
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,699
Oh, good girl.

265
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,212
Oh, Serena. Here. This is for you.

266
00:16:07,987 --> 00:16:09,175
Where'd you get this?

267
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,428
From Nate, who got it from Carter.

268
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,138
<i>Surprise, S.</i>

269
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,308
<i>A special delivery,
courtesy of little J.</i>

270
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,978
<i>I guess good things don't
always come in small packages.</i>

271
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:39,789
Now it is time to play traditional
eastern European wedding games.

272
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:43,126
Some of these games date
all the way back to 14th century,

273
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:46,713
but back then they used virgins.
And today... not so much.

274
00:16:47,984 --> 00:16:49,617
First game we play is balloon game.

275
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,185
Everybody must find partner.

276
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,126
You take balloon and put in between.

277
00:16:53,251 --> 00:16:56,264
Now when music changes,
you and partner get closer.

278
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:00,681
Now whoever does not pop
balloon wins game.

279
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,437
Oh! And winner...

280
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,024
gets rare matryoshka doll.

281
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,379
Okay, let's play.

282
00:17:13,424 --> 00:17:16,743
Traditions since the 14th century?
What's next, raping and pillaging?

283
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,620
I'm guessing you didn't see Elliot.

284
00:17:19,092 --> 00:17:22,394
I waited in the lobby for three hours.
I beat my high score in "Brickbreaker."

285
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,396
Maybe I should just give up.

286
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:30,785
No. Quitting is for losers,
except Oprah can get away with it...

287
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,134
And, maybe Nate and Serena.

288
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:37,115
What? Serena's my sister
and Nate's my friend.

289
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,033
I just want to make sure they're okay.
That's all.

290
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:42,184
Really.

291
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:48,775
Chuck Bass. I hear a lot about you.

292
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,039
You're infamous in Brighton beach.

293
00:17:51,164 --> 00:17:54,264
I'm guessing so are you.
But if you'll excuse me...

294
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:00,120
We've done something like
this before, remember?

295
00:18:00,802 --> 00:18:03,456
No talking.
Just dance.

296
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:16,302
I should have told you about Carter.

297
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,388
I bumped into him on the street

298
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,141
the other day, and I told him
we could have coffee, and that's it.

299
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,017
That's not how Carter made it seem.

300
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,896
You know how he is. He convinced
his fourth grade class at Dalton

301
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,671
that Barneys was named after
the dinosaur. He's a liar.

302
00:18:28,796 --> 00:18:30,981
Nate, if he made it seem like
anything other than coffee,

303
00:18:31,106 --> 00:18:33,194
then he was just
trying to upset you.

304
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:38,324
And obviously, he
succeeded. Come on, Nate.

305
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:40,994
This is me you're talking
to. You have to trust me.

306
00:18:43,897 --> 00:18:45,206
You don't trust me?

307
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,958
Why should I trust you?

308
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,878
The reason we're having this
conversation is because you got caught.

309
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,714
- I was going to tell you.
- When, after the fact?

310
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,009
Why didn't you tell me?

311
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,344
Because...

312
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:10,842
Where's your partner?

313
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:14,194
She's in Vermont. I was thinking
about sitting this one out.

314
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:17,322
If you're not going to dance,
at least make yourself useful.

315
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,190
These Russians drink more than
Larry Hagman on his first liver.

316
00:19:21,975 --> 00:19:23,286
Bartender needs more ice.

317
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:26,122
You do know that
I'm not working this party, right?

318
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,042
All right, I'll do it.

319
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,672
Thank you.

320
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:40,178
- What the hell has gotten into you?
- Dorota's gift is finalized.

321
00:19:41,006 --> 00:19:42,972
- The papers are signed.
- Papers?

322
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,058
What papers?
Did you get her a puppy?

323
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:46,326
Even better.

324
00:19:47,444 --> 00:19:48,561
An apartment.

325
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:51,741
An apartment. Have you gone crazy?

326
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:53,775
I was thinking more of
a Vera Wang cake knife.

327
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,985
A cake knife is not enough.

328
00:19:56,956 --> 00:19:59,826
The apartment is great.
It's in Queens,

329
00:19:59,951 --> 00:20:01,699
an easy commute on the subway.

330
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,375
Why does Dorota need
an apartment in Queens

331
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,039
when she lives in a penthouse
on the Upper East Side?

332
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,246
She's getting married.
They have a baby on the way.

333
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,711
- I figured...
- You figured wrong.

334
00:20:14,322 --> 00:20:17,543
Getting Dorota an apartment
is highly inappropriate.

335
00:20:17,668 --> 00:20:19,717
She's just a maid,
for goodness sake.

336
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,970
But Dorota's family.

337
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,140
She practically raised Blair.

338
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:37,634
So your balloon burst, too?

339
00:20:39,431 --> 00:20:41,948
Let me guess... you
overheard me and Serena.

340
00:20:42,884 --> 00:20:44,703
Yeah. Kinda couldn't help it.

341
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:47,778
Look, I love Serena, but
I also know how she is.

342
00:20:47,903 --> 00:20:50,123
I get it. It's hard
to know the truth with her.

343
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,854
Maybe I overreacted, right?
I get to talk to all my exes.

344
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:55,671
Maybe it's okay
she had coffee with the guy.

345
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,796
Yeah.

346
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,441
Do you know what was in the envelope
that Carter gave her?

347
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:03,028
I don't know. I didn't open it.

348
00:21:03,153 --> 00:21:06,778
Well, we could peek
inside her V.B.H...

349
00:21:06,903 --> 00:21:09,603
Jenny, you can't go
through Serena's purse.

350
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:12,911
Why would Serena need
a key to the St. Regis?

351
00:21:24,545 --> 00:21:27,087
Miss Blair, you go down!

352
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:29,156
Too easy.

353
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:31,331
Looks like we might win.

354
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,062
You can have the doll.
I'm sure you'll know what to do

355
00:21:34,187 --> 00:21:36,419
with five women with
removable heads.

356
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,137
Whatever the prize...

357
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,070
You have to admit...

358
00:21:42,248 --> 00:21:43,948
Together, we can't lose.

359
00:21:47,942 --> 00:21:50,250
No matter how many
weddings you plan,

360
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,018
nothing can fix what happened.

361
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,736
What I did was wrong.

362
00:21:54,473 --> 00:21:55,647
I'm sorry.

363
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,741
But no one forced you
to go up there.

364
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:00,777
I forced myself for you.

365
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,745
- You didn't even know...
- I know. I just...

366
00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:10,578
This game is over.

367
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:27,292
You okay?

368
00:22:28,044 --> 00:22:29,144
No, I'm not.

369
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:31,266
Why do you even care?

370
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:34,421
You've always thought
the worst of Chuck and me.

371
00:22:34,546 --> 00:22:38,147
You think we're horrible,
depraved, soulless.

372
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:41,798
And I may have used all of those
words at one point or another, but I...

373
00:22:41,923 --> 00:22:45,039
I'm sorry. I'm not following.
What's going on? Did Chuck...

374
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,509
Did Chuck do something?

375
00:22:46,634 --> 00:22:48,634
No, it's not just what he did.

376
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:50,493
It's what I did.

377
00:22:51,602 --> 00:22:53,955
This whole time I was blaming him,
but it was me, too.

378
00:22:56,831 --> 00:22:59,043
I've become the person
you always thought I was.

379
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,041
I don't think you're
that bad of a person,

380
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:03,006
maybe not my type, but
you're not terrible.

381
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:05,814
And-and whatever it is that
happened between you and Chuck,

382
00:23:05,939 --> 00:23:09,001
I'm sure you can fix it, because if
there was a pair meant for one another,

383
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:11,014
you know, it's you two.

384
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,010
You're absolutely right.

385
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,760
Chuck and Blair.
Blair and Chuck.

386
00:23:16,885 --> 00:23:19,716
I mean, who else could love me
after what I've become?

387
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:21,983
Thank you for helping me see it,
Humphrey.

388
00:23:24,806 --> 00:23:26,309
Your ice is melting.

389
00:23:30,794 --> 00:23:33,198
Hi. This is Rufus Humphrey.
I've left a few messages

390
00:23:33,323 --> 00:23:35,299
for my wife Lily
and haven't heard back,

391
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,321
and she didn't call
me at our usual time.

392
00:23:37,446 --> 00:23:40,046
No, I know you have
rules about no phone.

393
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:43,466
Lily Humphrey?

394
00:23:45,714 --> 00:23:47,383
Maybe it's under
Lily Van Der Woodsen?

395
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,509
Bass?

396
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:50,796
Rhodes?

397
00:23:50,921 --> 00:23:53,349
<i>Looks like Lily's caught in a lie.</i>

398
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,475
Okay. I must have gotten
the dates wrong. Thanks.

399
00:23:56,283 --> 00:23:59,083
<i>Guess it's the truth
that's getting massaged.</i>

400
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:40,861
Everything you said
last night was true.

401
00:24:41,851 --> 00:24:43,451
We do belong together.

402
00:24:45,938 --> 00:24:47,839
We're both sick and twisted.

403
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,720
If you think about it,

404
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,100
we're incredibly
fortunate to have even found each other.

405
00:24:56,749 --> 00:24:59,499
Blair, I don't want
this to be you settling,

406
00:24:59,943 --> 00:25:01,693
some sort of consolation.

407
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:04,319
We've both hit rock bottom, Chuck,

408
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,014
but we've hit it together.

409
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,388
At least we won't be lonely in hell.

410
00:25:10,513 --> 00:25:12,213
That's not what we're...

411
00:25:13,236 --> 00:25:15,336
I should see if anyone needs me.

412
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:19,892
I thought you'd be happy.

413
00:25:22,566 --> 00:25:23,968
<i>Any luck with that Elliot guy?</i>

414
00:25:24,093 --> 00:25:25,593
No. He never showed.

415
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,494
Maybe Vanya will have
a cute gay cousin.

416
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,655
Should we be worried
that your dad isn't coming?

417
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:37,096
I think he was hoping that
Lily would show up, but it'll be fine.

418
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,661
Thanks.

419
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:47,963
<i>Hello. You've reached the voice mail for
Celia Rhodes. Please leave a message.</i>

420
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,480
Cece, hi. It's Rufus.

421
00:25:49,605 --> 00:25:53,548
I don't know where you and Lily are,
but I know it's not Canyon Ranch.

422
00:25:54,764 --> 00:25:55,928
We need to talk.

423
00:25:58,444 --> 00:25:59,709
In Russian tradition,

424
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,518
before a groom can marry his bride,

425
00:26:02,932 --> 00:26:05,813
the wedding party
gathers and demands

426
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,400
that he answer a series of
questions about his beloved.

427
00:26:09,906 --> 00:26:12,700
If he's unable to
answer these questions

428
00:26:12,825 --> 00:26:14,975
to the satisfaction of the crowd,

429
00:26:15,628 --> 00:26:17,478
the wedding cannot proceed.

430
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:22,450
Vanya, are you ready?

431
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:26,501
Yeah.

432
00:26:31,594 --> 00:26:33,888
That was an awkward car ride.

433
00:26:35,471 --> 00:26:37,261
You barely said two words to me.

434
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,806
Look, I know you're still mad,
but I want to tell you the truth.

435
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:44,227
Then you can start by telling me what
you were doing in Carter's hotel room.

436
00:26:45,825 --> 00:26:47,188
I found the key, Serena.

437
00:26:48,427 --> 00:26:49,857
You went through my bag?

438
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:53,589
Carter is helping me find my dad.

439
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,780
Was he in Carter's hotel room?

440
00:26:56,155 --> 00:26:58,199
I love you.
I'm not interested in Carter.

441
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,117
Then why do you still
have secrets with him?

442
00:27:01,242 --> 00:27:04,892
I was nervous to tell you that
I was still looking for my dad.

443
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:09,001
I felt stupid,
like I'd be disappointing you.

444
00:27:10,408 --> 00:27:13,381
Look, I told you the truth. I don't know
what else you want me to do.

445
00:27:14,545 --> 00:27:15,967
I want you to stop seeing him.

446
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,651
I know you're upset,

447
00:27:19,776 --> 00:27:22,598
but that doesn't give you the right
to tell me who I can and can't see.

448
00:27:23,112 --> 00:27:25,121
With Carter, yes, it does.

449
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,694
This is the final question...

450
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:37,572
what do you love most about Dorota?

451
00:27:38,608 --> 00:27:41,200
Oh, this is tough question.

452
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,386
There's so many things
I love about her.

453
00:27:43,511 --> 00:27:45,997
But I think what I love most

454
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,665
is the way I feel with her.

455
00:27:48,635 --> 00:27:51,956
With Dorota, I am best
possible version of myself.

456
00:27:52,612 --> 00:27:55,631
I have peace in my heart,
knowing I will be good husband,

457
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,675
good father.

458
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,845
I will die proud Russian man,

459
00:28:01,294 --> 00:28:02,694
very much in love.

460
00:28:03,686 --> 00:28:07,076
Now you may officially
greet your bride.

461
00:28:12,698 --> 00:28:16,498
And now... it's time to get married!

462
00:28:20,384 --> 00:28:23,748
So... will the happy couple

463
00:28:23,873 --> 00:28:27,835
who will be escorting Dorota
and Vanya into the chapel

464
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,460
please step forward?

465
00:28:39,055 --> 00:28:40,655
Miss Blair, are you...

466
00:28:41,757 --> 00:28:43,262
I can't do this.

467
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,513
Miss Blair.

468
00:28:45,785 --> 00:28:48,851
I can't keep pretending, and
I can't lie to you, Dorota.

469
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:53,942
Chuck and I aren't happy... at all,

470
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,902
and if we walk you in,
your marriage will be jinxed.

471
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:03,758
I'm... I'm sorry.
I can't.

472
00:29:05,097 --> 00:29:06,628
<i>Poor Chuck.</i>

473
00:29:06,753 --> 00:29:10,162
<i>Looks like he's got a runaway
bridesmaid on his hands.</i>

474
00:29:18,011 --> 00:29:21,425
I should have realized that something
was still wrong with you and Mr. Chuck.

475
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:23,803
But you always tell me everything.

476
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,236
I couldn't admit it to anyone.

477
00:29:27,361 --> 00:29:28,891
I could barely admit it to myself.

478
00:29:31,691 --> 00:29:33,891
And I didn't want to let you down.

479
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:37,525
I'm sorry I ruined your wedding,
Dorota. Does Vanya hate me?

480
00:29:39,572 --> 00:29:41,022
No. Miss Blair,

481
00:29:43,272 --> 00:29:45,063
I came to America

482
00:29:45,931 --> 00:29:47,331
to start new life,

483
00:29:48,624 --> 00:29:50,246
to make new traditions.

484
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,734
And lucky for me,

485
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,183
I find great people to do this with.

486
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,046
I find my family.

487
00:30:03,827 --> 00:30:06,327
When I saw how happy
you and Vanya are,

488
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:09,890
I realized how unhappy I am.

489
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,437
I wish you to be like me one day,

490
00:30:15,796 --> 00:30:18,543
to find right love, good love.

491
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:23,821
I don't need you to be
happy couple, Miss Blair.

492
00:30:25,296 --> 00:30:27,241
I just need you to be happy.

493
00:30:40,723 --> 00:30:44,175
Come on, ladies.
You have an aisle to walk down.

494
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:56,872
I just got your text. What are you
doing here? I told you to stay away.

495
00:30:56,997 --> 00:30:59,023
I just got another call from my P.I.
about your dad.

496
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:01,379
What'd he say?

497
00:31:01,504 --> 00:31:04,044
He has his exact location,
just a 3-hour plane ride away.

498
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:05,738
You ready for this?

499
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:09,617
I don't know how long he'll stay there.
It's now or never.

500
00:31:12,007 --> 00:31:15,607
What are you doing? Everything's
booked. This is your chance.

501
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:21,613
This time won't be like the last.

502
00:31:21,738 --> 00:31:23,452
I'm gonna make him see me.

503
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:24,577
Attagirl.

504
00:31:25,934 --> 00:31:28,177
Wait. I should tell someone
I'm leaving.

505
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,721
No, there's no time.
Call from the car.

506
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:51,575
- Did I miss anything?
- No.

507
00:31:55,765 --> 00:31:58,202
- What are you doing here?
- I love Dorota. We're tight now.

508
00:31:58,327 --> 00:32:01,669
We talked about <i>The Vampire Diaries</i>
in the elevator on Friday.

509
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,487
- I was hoping you'd be here.
- Here I am.

510
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:07,925
This is Jenny, my stepsister.

511
00:32:08,223 --> 00:32:09,223
Hi.

512
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,929
And I'm Chelsey, his girlfriend.

513
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,479
Sorry.

514
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,130
You were right.

515
00:32:59,935 --> 00:33:01,285
Dorota is family.

516
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:07,866
I guess I was just too scared
to admit it, because I didn't want

517
00:33:08,693 --> 00:33:11,405
to think that anyone else have raised
my daughter better than I could have.

518
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,324
But you're a great mother.

519
00:33:15,548 --> 00:33:16,827
I could have been better.

520
00:33:17,714 --> 00:33:20,039
But there was some stuff that
happened before you came along.

521
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,697
Wait.

522
00:33:44,152 --> 00:33:45,648
Did you really mean what you said?

523
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:50,152
- When your uncle threw me out...
- Wait. He threw you out?

524
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,512
- You didn't actually...
- Why are you laughing?

525
00:33:53,637 --> 00:33:55,178
Nothing happened.

526
00:33:55,303 --> 00:33:58,369
It's not nothing. I didn't do it,
but I would have.

527
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,208
I want what Dorota and Vanya have...

528
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,118
real love,

529
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:07,670
pure and simple love.

530
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:09,463
You'd be bored within five minutes.

531
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:12,132
Better bored than ashamed of myself.

532
00:34:14,249 --> 00:34:16,079
I would do anything for you, Chuck.

533
00:34:18,249 --> 00:34:19,682
But what if that's wrong?

534
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:24,270
I never thought it was possible to love
someone too much, but maybe it is.

535
00:34:28,045 --> 00:34:29,733
I don't like
who I've become with you.

536
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,485
Wait. Blair...

537
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,049
Don't bail on me.

538
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:36,990
We have to see this through
to the end.

539
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:44,369
This is the end, Chuck.

540
00:34:54,273 --> 00:34:56,593
Have you seen Serena?
She missed the whole ceremony.

541
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,202
What's the matter?

542
00:35:03,857 --> 00:35:06,222
I didn't want to have to
be the one to tell you this,

543
00:35:08,786 --> 00:35:10,517
but, uh, Serena left with Carter.

544
00:35:17,411 --> 00:35:20,617
Only a few short hours until
you'll be reunited with your dad.

545
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,871
What's the first thing you're gonna say
to Dr. Daddy Van Der Woodsen?

546
00:35:25,987 --> 00:35:27,958
How long have you
known my dad's in Palm Beach?

547
00:35:28,415 --> 00:35:29,877
I don't know. A day or two?

548
00:35:33,663 --> 00:35:35,157
- Fine. A week.
- A week?

549
00:35:35,856 --> 00:35:38,233
You've known this entire
time, and you haven't told me?

550
00:35:40,197 --> 00:35:42,347
Nate was right. You were
using this to get closer.

551
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,893
I was still seeing if there's something
between us, and there obviously is.

552
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:51,065
- What's the big deal?
- I love my boyfriendvery much.

553
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:54,919
You're really gonna settle for that?

554
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,321
Can you stop the car, please?

555
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,333
- Get out.
- What?

556
00:36:06,735 --> 00:36:09,166
Don't be like this. You're just nervous
about seeing your dad.

557
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,454
I don't need your help
anymore or ever again.

558
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:13,545
I should have done this
on my own from the start.

559
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:18,528
Fine. If that's what you want.

560
00:36:24,492 --> 00:36:26,671
Keep going, please.
I have a plane to catch.

561
00:36:29,743 --> 00:36:31,021
<i>Good-bye, Baizen.</i>

562
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,743
<i>Hello, Palm Beach.</i>

563
00:36:32,868 --> 00:36:34,428
<i>With Carter out of the picture,</i>

564
00:36:34,553 --> 00:36:37,309
<i>it looks like Serena's making room
for daddy.</i>

565
00:36:44,316 --> 00:36:47,871
One, two, three!

566
00:36:54,315 --> 00:36:56,482
- <i>Mazel Tov!</i>
- Thank you.

567
00:36:57,511 --> 00:37:01,426
This is for you and this one's
for you, from Cyrus and me.

568
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:04,263
It's the keys to an apartment

569
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:05,449
in Queens...

570
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:08,183
and it's your apartment in Queens!

571
00:37:13,585 --> 00:37:15,524
An apartment!
Oh! Thank you!

572
00:37:20,186 --> 00:37:22,781
Thank you, Dorota, for...

573
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:25,284
everything.

574
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:28,940
Miss Eleanor, you've been so
kind to me all these years.

575
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,832
I always think of you like a mother.

576
00:37:33,213 --> 00:37:35,043
Maybe big sister.

577
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:38,133
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

578
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:39,631
Oh, have good health.

579
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,426
We got apartment!
An apartment!

580
00:37:47,741 --> 00:37:50,218
No, thanks for calling me back.
I was afraid you might not.

581
00:37:50,591 --> 00:37:53,549
<i>Of course. I got your message.
What's been bothering you?</i>

582
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,449
I love my wife,

583
00:37:56,973 --> 00:37:58,553
but I've had it with all her lies.

584
00:37:58,678 --> 00:38:01,153
Tell me what's going on
or I'm walking out this door

585
00:38:01,684 --> 00:38:03,066
and I'm never looking back.

586
00:38:03,191 --> 00:38:05,617
<i>Oh, Rufus, you're right
that Lily's not with me,</i>

587
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,038
<i>but more than that,
it's not my place to say.</i>

588
00:38:08,461 --> 00:38:10,746
<i>I'm afraid you'll need to get
the rest from Lily.</i>

589
00:38:11,178 --> 00:38:12,081
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

590
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,687
Maybe we should get some champagne.

591
00:38:17,812 --> 00:38:20,699
- Bartender, a bottle and two glasses.
- Sure thing.

592
00:38:20,824 --> 00:38:22,049
Now...

593
00:38:29,897 --> 00:38:30,892
Just to clarify,

594
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:33,845
I do think you deserve to be with
someone who makes you happy.

595
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:36,480
Coming as it does from someone
who dates Vanessa Abrams,

596
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,023
it means very little to me.

597
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:40,820
But still, thank you, Humphrey.

598
00:38:41,505 --> 00:38:42,653
Care for a dance?

599
00:38:43,492 --> 00:38:44,402
I guess.

600
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,216
Follow me.

601
00:38:49,564 --> 00:38:52,246
Come on, Chuck.
What are you doing?

602
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:53,772
Don't look so surprised.

603
00:38:53,897 --> 00:38:56,809
I'm single now. This is who I am.

604
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:06,762
Wanna dance?

605
00:39:07,938 --> 00:39:10,178
Shouldn't you be doing
that with your girlfriend?

606
00:39:10,303 --> 00:39:11,374
Chelsey took off.

607
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:15,477
We kind of got into a fight.

608
00:39:16,506 --> 00:39:17,479
Sorry.

609
00:39:17,975 --> 00:39:18,846
I'm not.

610
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:22,079
No, she was mad because I
kept talking

611
00:39:22,204 --> 00:39:24,403
about this guy
that I met in the lobby of my building.

612
00:39:24,911 --> 00:39:27,364
And then I dragged her
out to a wedding in Queens.

613
00:39:29,251 --> 00:39:30,701
I guess I'm a little obsessed.

614
00:39:32,142 --> 00:39:33,225
I don't get it.

615
00:39:33,775 --> 00:39:34,746
You like girls.

616
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,331
But I also like boys.

617
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:38,917
And I like you.

618
00:39:45,146 --> 00:39:46,079
Let's go.

619
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,724
Hey, Serena. It's Jenny,
answering, uh, Nate's phone.

620
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,689
Jenny, I'm so glad you picked up.
Do you know where Nate is?

621
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:05,235
No. I don't see him right now.

622
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,405
If you find him, can you just tell him
to call me back as soon as he can?

623
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:12,367
<i>Also, just tell him</i> that I love him
and I don't want any more secrets.

624
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:15,746
Yeah, sure. If I see him,
I'll give him the message.

625
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,914
Thank you, Jenny. I appreciate it.

626
00:40:20,857 --> 00:40:24,169
<i>While most people think it's our
brain that controls our actions,</i>

627
00:40:24,294 --> 00:40:26,765
<i>it is often our heart
that gets the biggest workout.</i>

628
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,342
Hey, you wanna dance?

629
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:38,085
<i>It can make us do
the craziest of things,</i>

630
00:40:39,661 --> 00:40:42,623
<i>but it can also let us take
a chance on new adventures.</i>

631
00:40:49,162 --> 00:40:51,033
<i>Because when we open our heart,</i>

632
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:53,450
<i>we can explore a world of love...</i>

633
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,701
<i>And be pleasantly surprised</i>

634
00:40:56,826 --> 00:40:59,090
<i>by the people already in our life.</i>

635
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:21,770
<i>But unfortunately, our
hearts are very sensitive,</i>

636
00:41:22,677 --> 00:41:24,055
<i>and when they're broken,</i>

637
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,831
<i>everything around us is shattered.</i>

638
00:41:27,546 --> 00:41:29,569
Hello?
Dad?

639
00:41:31,704 --> 00:41:33,407
- Serena.
- Mom.

640
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,953
<i>Total eclipse of the heart.</i>
