1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,900
Three words, eight letters.
Say it, and i'm yours.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,700
I...

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,900
that's all i needed to hear.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,800
What do you say we just forget
thinking And follow our hearts?

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Yore a part of this legacy,
too, nathaniel.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,900
I don't want to owe him
or my family anything. 

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,300
- Serena, where's charles?
- Mom, what's wrong?

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,600
Bart's been in an accident.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,000
My father's dead
because of your father.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,600
I will stand by you
through anything.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,100
Why would you do that?

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,900
Because i love you.

13
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,900
Well, that's too bad.

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,700
There's something
you need to know.

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,800
Just tell me one thing.
Was it a boy or a girl?

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,500
I had enough trouble
With the idea of mom and rufus dating.

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,700
But now i share a sibling
with my boyfriend?

18
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,100
It's over, isn't it?

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,200
- Andrew got caught in aiptide.
- Yeah, if we had known,

20
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,100
- We wouldn't have even bothered you.
- Is it over?

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,600
We've already lost one son.
We weren't losing another.

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,200
You got here to n.Y.U.?
I'm starting in the fall.

23
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,600
Uh, i just transferred ??

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,800
And tell me if
what you feel for me is real.

25
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,700
It's just a game.

26
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,400
Chuck,
why did you just do that?

27
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,900
Because i love her.

28
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,200
You're famous
because you got arrested.

29
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,900
The end ???
The end of me on "gossip girl."

30
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,300
Congratulations.

31
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,900
You ve a clean slate...
until college.

32
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,600
Her dad ??

33
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,800
So i think that makes her
richer than all of you.

34
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,400
Carter.

35
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,300
I have something you might want
to know before you go.

36
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,500
It's about santorini,
what you were looking for there.

37
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,000
You found my father?

38
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,200
You were right.
I love you, too.

<i>Welcome back,
upper east siders.</i>

43
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,500
<i>After a long,
hot summer away,</i>

44
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,300
<i>I see it didn't take much time for you
to dirty up The clean slates i gave you.</i>

45
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
<i>My inbox is overflowing,</i>

46
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,800
<i>So let's get
to the good stuff, sll we?</i>

47
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,300
<i>Spotted--Chuck bass
up to his old tricks.</i>

48
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,500
<i>Poor b.</i>
<i>I guess nothing good lasts forever.</i>

49
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,200
I'm chuck... bass.

50
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
I know.

51
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,800
I wasn't expecting
to see someone like you

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,800
Somewhere like this
so early in the day.

53
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,700
I'm in need of refuge.
It's too hot.

54
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,200
Oh, it's never too hot.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,600
Care to test that theory?

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,700
What if i have a girlfriend?

57
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,400
Chuck bass
doesn't do girlfriends.

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,800
Where's your limo?

59
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,300
I gave my driver
the day off.

60
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,900
Then i guess we'll have to find
someplace else.

61
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,200
<i>As for a certain leggy blonde
by a hamptons pool...</i>

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,900
<i>Looks like serena left
big shoes to fill--</i>

63
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,000
<i>And someone finds them
the perfect fit.</i>

64
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,100
Well, i found it. And just
in time. The car's here.

65
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,900
Now it's time to go...

66
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Get you dressed?

67
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,200
Mm. No, i'm not leaving.

68
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,600
I don't think
we have a choice.

69
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,900
As soon as we get ??

70
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,400
It means no more beaches
and no more bonfires

71
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,600
And no more stalking the barefoot contessa
Through 1770 house.

72
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,400
Our summer in the hamptons Is officially over.

73
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,300
So, uh... a sit-In?

74
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,400
More like a lie-In, at least
until the sun goes down.

75
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,000
You're--You're sure your dad
doesn't know?

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,900
Oh, totally. I mean,
we hid all the evidence.

77
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,000
Look, dan doesn't even know. He's too busy
pre-Readin all his books for college.

78
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,800
And i snuck onto his laptop and, uh, 

79
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,700
might've disabled His
"serena van der woodsen" google alert.

80
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,400
Yeah, t what happens
when we get back to the city?

81
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,900
Then it's serena's problem.

82
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,300
As for now, we made her a promise.
And it is very important to keep those...

83
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,600
Even if they were asked via drunken text
From a turkish pay-As-You-Go phone.

84
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,600
Our bags are packed.
The house is closed up.

85
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,900
But the real question remains.

86
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,700
Now that you've spent your whole summer
Drinking your coffee out of cece's china,

87
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,300
Will it taste as good coming out of
Your "welcome back, kotter" mug at home?

88
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,400
Sure, it was great out here,
but i like the real world, too.

89
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,000
??

90
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,400
It's a better-Smelling, higher thread
count version Of the real world,

91
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,500
- yeah.
- but still...

92
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,800
Hey you guys aren't ready?
Serena's gonna be home by 6:00.

93
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,500
I-I mean, how can she even
greet us when she gets here?

94
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Isn't she taking a vow of silence
For a month at the ashram?

95
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,600
I don't know. That eat, pray,
love" thing Of hers is great and all,

96
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,000
but i-I just highly doubt She can
keep her mouth shut a whole month.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,900
Even so, it's time to leave.
???

98
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,900
Uh, yeah. I-I need to meet up
with vanessa, too,

99
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,400
'Cause she apparently has something to
tell me About how she spent her summer.

100
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,100
Wasn't she in ??

101
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
here they are!</i>

102
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,900
Well, it's a good thing The flight attendants
dim the cabin lights Over the atlantic.

103
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,900
Mm, even better thing That my car
got a flat on the way to heathrow,

104
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,200
And i missed the plane
that i was supposed to bon.

105
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,500
Otherwise i would've been sitting
in seat 3b Of an entirely different plane,

106
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,500
Making out with an entely
different passenger In seat 3a. 

107
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,500
All right, So now that we're back on
our own turf, Do i at least get your number?

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,200
Maybe your last name?

109
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,200
A little mysterynever hur ??

110
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,000
Really? Oh, come on. Please.
Yogotta give me something to go on here.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay. Uh, well, we are going
to the same school.

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,800
Yeah, and columbia's
kind of a big one.

113
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,400
I mean, especially when
you factor in graduate school.

114
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,300
You caught that?

115
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,900
See, you're a better detective
than you think.

116
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,700
Well, my car is waiting.

117
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,300
Oh, are you done with that?
I'll take it.

118
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,300
Yeah, sure.

119
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,500
??

120
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,800
Ew. On second thought...

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,500
You have a problem
with the buckleys?

122
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,700
Yeah, well, that right-Wing nut job Called william
van der bilt a deviant For lobbying against d.O.M.A.

123
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,700
Maybe that's because william van der bilt
Called jeb buckley a cokehead and a cheater.

124
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,900
What, are you saying ??
If you get your congressional aide pregnant?

125
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,300
???

126
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh, my god.

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,100
- You're nate archibald.
- And you're bree buckley.

128
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,200
You pulled my hair
during clinton's inaugural ball.

129
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,700
Your redneck cousins trieto waterboard me
At the easteegg hunt on the white house lawn.

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,400
It's good to see you again.

131
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah, take care of yourself.

132
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,900
- Why not?
- It's better to wait.

133
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,100
- How long?
- Oh, let's see...

134
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,200
Now.

135
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,400
What the hell is going on?!

136
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,700
Blair... i can explain.

137
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,600
Um, i'm sorry.
I-I didn't know he had a girlfriend.

138
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,300
yeS,you did. She did.

139
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,400
Shame on you, ashley hinshaw.
How could you do that?

140
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,200
Pick up someone
in a relationship?!

141
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,100
- Have you no pride? No self-Respect?
- Okay, but i didn't know that--

142
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,900
You may have an abercrombie campaign And
the security code to clooney's castle in lake como,

143
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,600
But that doesn't give you the right
to try To steal someone else's man!

144
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,400
Now take your american girl hair
And your poreless skin and get out!

145
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,500
Okay, you're crazy.

146
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,000
- Hey.
- Hi.

147
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,200
Oh, thank you.

148
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
It's been three hours.
I missed you.

149
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,100
Well, let me make it up to you.

150
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,900
Let's get out of here. 

151
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,100
Or we could stay.

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,800
So, uh, jenny'll take
eric'soom.

153
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,100
With chuck at the palace,
eric will take his room.

154
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,400
Oh, swee thank you. I really didn't want to
sleep Under chuck's dirty girl scout painting.

155
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,500
- Oh, and, uh, dan--
- Yeah. I ll thankfully be back home in brooklyn.

156
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,300
And when lily gets back,
we'll join you.

157
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,600
Oh, mr. Rufus, There are some packages
i coul't put upstairs.

158
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,300
Oh, what are you doing?

159
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,800
- Recycling?
- What?

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,100
Whoa, whoa.
Oh my... god!

161
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,700
- Uh, it--It's not what you think.
- So much for "eat, pray, love."

162
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,200
Well, you know, i guess
she got the "love" part right.

163
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,600
You can't say anything.
Promise. Dan?

164
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,400
Hey vanessa. Uh, yeah, i-I was
just about to head down there.

165
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,900
Serena... is home.

166
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,300
- Hello?
- Yeah, i'm gonna have to reschedule.

167
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,800
Oh, god.

168
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Dan can't make it.

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,200
I think mething's
going down with his family.

170
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,500
Did he say what it was?

171
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,400
<i>As for serena van der woodsen?</i>

172
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,200
- <i>You left america a star.</i>
- Excuse me, please.

173
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,100
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know. Please help.

174
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:48,000
<i>But after your exploits in europe...</i>
<i>You've come back a supernova.</i>

175
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,500
<i>And yet, nothing explodes
without a fuse.</i>

176
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,800
<i>I wonder what...or Who lit yours.</i>

177
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,800
Is, uh, serena up yet?
We were talking till late.

178
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,200
Uh, i-I think i ard her.

179
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,900
What's that?

180
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,200
Money your mother left us
for emergencies.

181
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,900
Not to boast, but we haven't
used a penny of it all summer.

182
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,400
Well, thank heaven for salaried servants
And an account at the beach club, right?

183
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,100
Oh, well, i'm glad i have
the numb for city harvest.

184
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,200
This is all a little much.

185
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,500
A little much?
??

186
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,400
Mom wanted everybody to feel
welcome while e was away.

187
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,800
- Or she's trying to bribe us.
- What? No. 

188
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,200
In fact, she g us
a special treat for tomorrow--

189
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,800
A table in our name At the van der bilt
annual charity polo match in greenwich.

190
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,300
Lily thought it would be fun,
So we are gonna go have fun for lily.

191
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,800
Please show your family support
by mimicking my expression.

192
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,800
U know, there'll probably
be photographers there.

193
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,100
Are you gonna be okay?
You might eate another mob scene.

1
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,700
oh, no, no. yeah, ???
i'm really sorry about yesterday.

2
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,400
i thought after the whole arrest scandal,
out of sht, out of mind.

3
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,300
i had no idea it would
be worse when i got back.

4
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,900
oh, you' apologized enough, ???

5
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
now that those vultures have the first shot of your return,
i'm sure they'll leave you alone.

6
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,500
- it's not like you're gonnaget arreste
- no, of course not.

7
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,200
um, i have to go meet blair
to go shopping.

8
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,600
you can't go to a polo match
without a hat.

9
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,300
i'm--i'm gonna walk you out.

10
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,500
uh, thank you for the escort, but i think
can walk 15 feet without hurting myself.

11
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,600
there was nothing out of sight
or out of mind about your trip.

12
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,000
i know what happened.

13
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,600
i-i don't know
what you're talking about.

14
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,200
serena, there was no ashram.

15
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,800
i went to  ashram...

16
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,800
on a tour.

17
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,500
dan, i appreciate your concern,

18
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,300
but the little white lies that i tell
my family are none of your business.

19
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,100
rufus is my family. you didn't
just lie to him. you lied to me.

20
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,500
althose e-mails about
the--the benefits of bikram?

21
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,200
"ten easy steps
to colon cleanse"?

22
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,400
turns out goop
is gd for something.

23
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,900
what's really going on here?

24
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,700
nothing. nothing. i-it was just
a few nits of harmless fun.

25
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
- that's--that's it.
- all right. all right.

26
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,400
- where'd you get that?
- they're all over the internet.

27
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,200
whatever is going on,
you can tell me.

28
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,300
thank you.
i-i have to go.

29
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,800
i know it's a buyer's market
right now,

30
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,500
but that doesn't mean there's
actually anything worth buying.

31
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,800
why don't you just stay
at the pale?

32
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,800
i'm done living in my father's shadow
and that iludes his hotel.

33
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,900
and running his company?

34
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,800
lily was doing an amazing job
overseeing the board before she left.

35
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,500
why not let her continue
what about you?

36
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,600
any word from the van der bilt compound
since you've been back?

37
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,700
not a word. torrow's
the family polo match.

38
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,100
i mean, when i skipped out on
the internship at the mayor's office,

39
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,700
i knew they'd be mad,
but now i'm getting the silent treatment.

40
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,900
so if they're mad already,
why don't you call the girl from the plane?

41
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,700
no, i'm not gonna use bree ???

42
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,900
you're missing
one key detail--

43
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,400
sleeping with the enemy
is hot.

44
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,100
why do you think i had
the whole ivanka thing?

45
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,500
look, i don't wanto stir up
stuff with my family.

46
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,200
look, if you think they're done trying
to control you, you're wrong,

47
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
and while you're
waiting for your proof,

48
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,700

why not take bree buckley
out on the town?

49
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
have some fun
with a girl you like

50
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,600
and show your family
that you're your own man.

51
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,300
being accepted for who you are is crucial,
nathaniel. like blair accepts me.

52
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,300
- wt, you do what?
- i go to eupe for three months,

53
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,200
and you turn from jane austen
to anais nin.

54
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,100
is there anything chuck bass
can't get you to do?

55
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,200
it was my idea.

56
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,100
no. no, it wasn't.

57
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,000
yeah. we--we had our honeymoon
period, and it was perfect,

58
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,300
but... while oth couples settle into a routine,
we we determined to keep things interesting.

59
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,000
so chuck plays the cheating bastard,
and i play the scorned woman.

60
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,400
i even get to choose
who to humiliate--

61
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
models, tourists,
upper west siders,

62
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,000
i don't know if but the honeymoon
is supposed to end.

63
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,800
it isn't real. the real part is when you settle down
with each other. the 3-month milestone.

64
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,300
it is not a milestone.
it's a gravestone.

65
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,300
settling down means death--
less sex, more silence.

66
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,800
we found a way to avoid that
that works for us.

67
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,300
wow. you guys sure
about th?

68
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,600
i mean, if you don't mind me saying so, i...
we, i think i know blair pretty well.

69
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,500
look, i would ???
any meion of the whole "jules and jim" thing.

70
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,800
all right. but listen,
the games may seem like fun.

71
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,900
are you su blair's
not just playing for you?

72
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,300
'cause if she's not doing it
for herself, too...

73
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,300
well, things could get mes.

74
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,000
if you love him,
then lock him down.

75
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,000
open relationships only invite chaos.
trust me. i know.

76
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,700
it's not an open relationship.
we're completely monogamous.

77
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,900
it's just one of our games,
like the rest.

78
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,700
yeah, until it isn't anymore.

79
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,500
playing the scorned woman and actually
being the scorned woman is a slippy slope.

80
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,100
b., college is about to start.
what happens wn one day you don't get there in time,

81
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,500
and he actually
kisses someone else, or worse?

82
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,900
he wouldn't.

83
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,000
i still have no idea
why they're following me.

84
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,800
oh, please. spare me, s.

85
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,200
i get every edition
of "hello!" and "ok!" ere is.

86
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,900
i know whayou did this summer,
and who.

87
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,700
cristiano ronaldo?

88
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,900
i hope you got your shots before you traveled.
should i be worried?

89
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,600
no. no, i just
had a great time.

90
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,300
i just wish that they
would leave me alone.

91
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,600
oh. is that why
you got your hair blown out?

92
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,600
listen to your quality problems.
serena's being chased by paparazzi,

93
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,100
my dad and sister are house-sitting a penthouse,
and i have a farmer's tan.

94
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,000
all right. okay. you got me. the good life
is--is actually-- it's pretty good.

95
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,200
what, uh, what was so important
that you had to bring me here to tell me in person?

96
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,900
i hose it's not about nate.

97
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,900
oh, we hooked up one night in
prague, but it was nbig deal.

98
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,700
but after i came back
and started hanging out at this place...

99
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,000
- please tell me you're not working here.
- i am so done serving coffee. thank god.

100
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,800
just made some new friends--
one in particular.

101
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,700
- he was here this morning.
- oh. so you are dating someone.

102
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,800
his name's scott, and i think
you guys would really like each other.

103
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,900
we actually met him here
in the spring ???

104
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,500
???we've been hanging out,

105
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,200
and, okay, maybe there's been
a little bit of flirting.

106
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,700
thank you. ???

107
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,800
okay, wait. why do you have
a knockoff designer wallet?

108
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,800
i thought you hated
intellectual property theft.

109
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,700
oh, it's to hold
all your $100 bills.

110
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,600
do you know how hard it is
to break one of those things?

111
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,900
i don't even know
why they make them.

112
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,500
i'm kidding. sort of.

113
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,400
it... noa knockoff.
it's a graduation present from lily,

114
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,100
as is wt's in it.

115
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,800
and you know what?
i-i thought i'd never use it,

116
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,700
but have you seen
the stitching?

117
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,800
oh, my god. dan humpey's been seduced
by wealth. it had to happen.

118
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,600
even frodo eventually gave in
to the power of the ring.

119
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,100
oh, come on. i'm still me.
i just have a nicer wallet.

120
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,400
and as for youfriend,
i'd love to meet him.

121
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,800
how about tomorrow?

122
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,500
we can do brooklyn things
like go to the dumpling truck

123
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,800
and play "signed or unsigned"
on the promenade.

124
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,600
that sounds great, but i, uh,
i have to do this thing for my dad, so...

125
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,700
okay. we'll find time.
walk you to the subway?

126
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,800
nah, i'm--i'm on the 6.

127
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,200
- oh. right.
- see? still me.

128
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,500
you left these.

129
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,900
oh. thanks.
these are my friend's.

130
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,300
mr. humphrey, the camera people are
in the trash outside. your trash.

131
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,800
all right. thanks, vanya.

132
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,400
i don't understand.
serena's arrest was mohs ago.

133

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
we should pick someone
out together,

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,200
take her back to my place.

144
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,100
or we could just stay in.

145
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,000

146
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,300

00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,600
ooh, that's not fair. everyone's
topless on valentino's yacht.

151
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,200

she's dancing on the table?

152
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,100
uh, well, that's what you do
in barcelona.

153

155
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,700
where you headed, beautiful?

156
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
carter.

157
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
- i was in the neighborhood.
- no, you weren't.

158
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,900
gossip gl said you'd returned.
i wanted to see you.

159
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,800
well, you've seen me. ???

160
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,800
- we need to talk.
- no, we don't.

161
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,600
i know whatyou're doing.

162
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
you can't avoid
what happened forever.

163
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,800
watch me.

164
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,500
oh, no!

165
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,200
<i>spotted-- serena van der woodsen
giving carter baizen the slip.</i>

166
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,900
<i>we've all seen the selects.</i>

167
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,800
<i>but what happened between them
when tmz was m.i.a.?</i>

168
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,800
<i>something tells me
the truth is just out of focus.</i>

169
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,800
well, you were right.

170
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,200
- your family?
- wants me exactly where i used to be,

171
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,100
expt they actually gave me
the wheels to get there this time.

172
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,900
check this out. "nate, most unfortunate
you missed out on the summer.

173
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,100
good thing fall internships beginext week."

174
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,000
- sorry, man.
- don't be.

175
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,400
it's about time i broke off from them once and for all,
and i think i know how i'm gna do it.

176
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,800
i just don't know why
he felt  had to lie to me.

177
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,700
i don't think
it was really a lie.

178
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
thank you.

179
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,600
he said he was taking the subway
when he had a limo waiting,

180
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,400
and not to mention, he told me
he was helping his dad tomorrow,

181
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,500
when gossip girl says he's attending
the van der bilt's polo match in a dior suit.

182
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,200
oh, is this the part where ipretend to ???

183
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
i mean, why keep these things
secret from me?

184
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,800
is he worried
that i'm gonna judge him?

185
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,300
- i wonder why he might even think that.
- i'm not judging! i get it.

186
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,800
if i had a limo that followed
me around, i'd take it, too.

187
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,700
i'm his best friend, and i
support him no matter what...

188
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
even if he were rich
and dressed likeruman capote.

189
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,300
yeah, you should probably
tell him that.

1
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,100
i should.

2
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,900
too bad heas that polo match
with his family?

3
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,900
- his whole family?
- yeah, and nate's family,

4
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,600
and i'm sure blair and
chuck will be there,

5
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,700
if the murder-suicide
i predicted hasn't happened yet.

6
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,400
well, why don't you
just call his dad?

7
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,900
from what you've said,
you sound pretty close to him.

8
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,900
say you han't seen a lot of
dan lately and you'd like to go.

9
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,400
you think i should invite
myself to a charity polo match?

10
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,300
yeah. just show up, tell dan
how great he looks in his suit,

11
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,600
and if he has room, you'd love
a ride back to the city in his limo.

12
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,400
i've never been to a polo match.
maybe you can get a plus one.

13
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,000
maybe.

14
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,700
- needs a sandwich.
- she looks just right to me.

15
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,100
- adam's apple.
- blair.

16
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,400
catalogue!

17
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,900
chuck, none of these girls
e even worth humiliating.

18
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
looking in the mirror
will do that for them.

19
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,300
is everything okay?
what's going on?

20
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,000
nothing's going on. why?

21
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,800
this is one-stop shopping, and
you're acting like everything last season.

22
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,600
i thought you wanted to play.

23
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,700
i did. i do.

24
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,900
i did.

25
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,100
the summer was great.

26
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,700
we had a lot of fun.

27
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,600
but maybe summer's over.

28
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,400
okay.

29
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,200
if that's what you want.

30
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,900
- is that what you want?
- i want you to be happy,

31
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
however that's achieved.

32
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,100
let's go home.

33
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
wow.

34
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,100
it, uh, looks...

35
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,600
smaller?

36
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,600
yeah.

37
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,400
your mom bought these for me
for cotillion, with cece.

38
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,800
how's she doing?

39
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,100
umnot great.

40
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,900
and the longer my mom's gone,
e more i worry that

41
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
grandma's tatments
aren't going well.

42
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,000
but your dad's been doing
a great job holding it all together.

43
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,900
at least, he's pretending to.

44
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,500
well, having ur
summer plans change,

45
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,200
stuck in charge of two kids that you
didn't raise in a house that you don't own...

46
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,000
yeah, i know. it sounds like
a reality show premise. uh...

47
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,400
- it's gotta be getting to him.
- plus the whole thing with serena.

48
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,600
the last time she went off the deep end,
she got rely messed up.

49
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,300
yeah. i wonder what really
happenethis summer.

50
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,800
well, now that rufus knows,
maybe we'll find out.

51
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,500
at is it? grandma?

52
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,900
no, it's you.

53
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,100
i'm sorry. he found out.

54
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,600
uh, before i get angry, why don't
you tell me what happened?

55
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,800
because i'd really like to not use my
imagination when it comes to these pictures.

56
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,800
you dot have to if you look
close enough. i--i'll shut up.

57
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,300
rufus, i know i
shouldn't have lied,

58
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,300
but i was in europe and i had just graduated,
and i got a little carried away.

59
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,800
and what happens in summer
stays in summer, right?

60
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,100
look, the only reason
i didn't tell you

61
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,500
is because i thought if i did,
you'd think i'd gone off the rails again. 

62
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,000
did you?

63
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,000
no.

64
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,600
no, ev-everything i said to
you last night was true.

65
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,000
i...

66
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,700
i'm done.

67
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,400
we'll put it behind us, then?

68
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,700
OK.

69
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:59,600
anin what is perhaps an ironic twist,
due to your current social status,

70
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,800
the polo socie has asked if you will
throw in the first ball at the match tomorrow.

71
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
i'd love to.

72
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,400
i'll go call 'em back.
your mom will be proud.

73
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,500
yeah, i-i didn't want to ala
my dad any further or anything,

74
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,400
but, uh, there was one guy who was in
a lot of those pictures with you.

75
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,600
- who--who was that?
- carter baizen.

76
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,000
we traveled together at
the beginning of summer.

77
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:29,800
but then things got weird, and...
and now he's stalking me.

78
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,400
he--he's been stalking
me everince.

79
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,100
and, uh, i don't know what to do
he won't leave me alone. so...

80
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
w-what--what are you saying?

81
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:41,000
look, if you hear from him or see him,
just please keep him away from me at all costs.

82
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,400
i'm worried what he might do.

83
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,700
??

84
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
hey, blair, it's dan.

85
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,800
i-i know i'm not someone you
want to ar from late at night,

86
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:04,400
or any hour, but i need
your help. uh, call me.

87
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,800
this just in--

88
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,400
an unlikely alliance is forming
on the upper east side.

89
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,900
yeahmom, everything's great.

90
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,200

91
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,600
and tomorrow's the day i get
to do what i came here for.

92
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,300
too bad it may be
too late to do any good.

93
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,900
last year, i had to go to the white party
as your date in a dress that i made myself.

94
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,800
and this year...

uh, no, it's okay. i won't do
anything worth publishing, not evenmile.

100
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,600
i should find blair.

101
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,400
well, the bad news is,
your last name's buckley.

102
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,100

information made you a lot easier to find.

103
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,600
yeah? well, i knew
you couldn't stay away.

104
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,000

look at her,

118
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:14,200
floang through the party with
her perfect pout and flawless figure.

119
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,500
you know, if were still in the game,
she'd be a great score.

120
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,800
but we're not, right?

121
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,100

00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,600

157
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,500
no, you can't,

158
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,300
not after what
i'm about to tell you.

159
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,700
the invitation you got to come 
this party wasn't exactly what y thought.

160
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,500
- spare me. where's serena?
- this him?

161
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,900
you've been served.

162
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,000
- what the hell is this?
- it's a restraining order.

163
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,300
this says i have to stay
away fr blair waldorf.

164
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,600
yeah, and until further notice,
you'll find me by serena's side.

165
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,500
step within 100 feet of me
and you'll be arrested.

166
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,500
and about how far
you think he is from me?

167
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,100
- yeah, i don't think he's far enough.
- i agree. security!

168
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,300

169
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,600
oh, your friends, uh,
are trying to have me removed.

170
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,800
right, because you're stalking me.

171
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,800
look, you don't have
to talk to him.

172
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,900
you told them was stalking you?

173
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,300
you wanna tell them
the truth or should i?

174
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,500
- what's the truth?
- yeah, carter. what's the truth?

175
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,500
sooner or later, you're gonna be alone,
with no one taking your picture.

176
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,600
- what will you do then?
- wait, serena. what--what is he talking about? 

1
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,800
Miss van der woodsen,
The first chukker is about to begin.

2
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,500
Oh.

3
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,200
You need to take position
for the first throw in.

4
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,800
Yes, of course.
??

5
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,700
- Uh, good-Bye, carter.
- Serena, wait!
- No, wait, it, wait. 

6
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,300
- You gotta tell us what's going on!
- Later!

7
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,600
Hi.

8
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,900
- I'm chuck bass.
- Alexandra.

9
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,800
- I don't believe it.
- Uh, well, all right, 

10
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,900
if she can't explain it,
Then maybe carter...

11
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,600
You found a bootleg copy
of that ncert? 

12
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Wow.

13
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,200
Yeah, i bet i have a recording
off the board somewhere.

14
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,900
I mean, i could get it to
vanessa for you if you'd like.

15
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,800
I'd love that.
Fact, um...

16
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,600
Hey. I'm gonna borrow this horse.

17
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,600
<i>Forget a grand entrance.</i>

18
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,100
<i>Everybody knows it's the exit they remember.</i>

19
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,900
Hey. I just got your text.
What's--What's going on?

20
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,600
You didn't tell me that you were
bringing me to a family event.

21
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,700
W--So?

22
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,200
Listen, i really like you.

23
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,100
And if your being here happens
to piss off my grandfather,

24
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,500
To be honest,
i figured you'd like that.

25
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:29,000
Hey, look, normally i'd totally be on
board The "let's piss off grandpa train,"

26
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,500
But what do you know
is that...

27
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,700
Currently, my family
isn't speaking to me,

28
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,300
Which is something that,
unlike you, i'd like to change.

29
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,400
Being ont row at a van der bilt charity
event Doesn't exactly send that message.

30
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,300
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

31
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,700
??

32
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,900
And i rebelled,
like you obviously do,

33
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,700
Except i took off
to europe.

34
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,200
A year into it,
i...

35
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,700
Found out that my cousin who's, like,
a sisr to me, Got stood up at the altar,

36
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,800
and i wasn't there for her Because i was
trying to prove some stupid point.

37
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,400
I'm just trying to find
my way back in.

38
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,700
I happened to bump into you
along the way.

39
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,800
Well, i'm glad you did.

40
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,000
???

41
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,100
The main reason i tracked you down
Was because i wanted to see you again.

42
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,100
If that means keeping
a low profile, i'm up for it.

43
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,200
??

44
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,900
I really can't risk making
my family more upset right now.

45
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,700
Hey, don worry. I'm good
at secret relationships.

46
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,400
I've had a bit of practice.

47
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,600
I figured you weren't planning on riding
All the way back to the city.

48
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,200
Why won't you
leave me alone, carter?

49
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,300
You're not my boyfriend.

50
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,800
No, but i seem to be the only
one you tell your secrets to.

51
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
Well, i guess
that was a mistake.

52
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,400
Dropping your dress,
stealing a horse?

53
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,300
- All it is is a cry for attention.
- I don't need ???

54
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,200
I'm getting plenty on my own,
in case you haven't noticed.

55
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,400
Yeah, plenty from everyone
except the one you want it from.

56
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,300
That's not true.

57
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,200
He didn't want to see you,
serena.

58
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,900
No, that's--
That's not what happened.

59
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,000
We spent a month chasing him
down and then we found him.

60
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
He couldn't even meet you
face-To-Face.

61
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,700
Well, maybe he didn't get my message

62
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,500
- Or he didn't realize who i was.
- Or he didn't realize who his daughter was?

63
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:36,100
Serena, what if your dad didn't
want to see you? Who cares?

64
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Who the hell is he
not to want you?

65
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,000
I would've stayed all summer
with you.

66
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,500
But after that,
You ditched me and ran again.

67
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,800
Well,
there the two of you are.

68
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,900
I've been looking for you
everywhere.

69
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,100
We were just discussing how we
were gonna get back to the city.

70
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,500
Well, i'll get you home.

71
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,200
No, thank you.
We'll find o own way.

72
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,700
I'm not gonna be taking
the internship, grandfather.

73
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,200
I hope you can
understand that.

74
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,400
Of course i can.

75
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,900
How many times
must i tell you, nathaniel?

76
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:28,300
I want to be your fily.
Work wherever, date whomever.

77
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,100
I won't stand in your way.

78
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,400
I, uh, just want you
to be happy.

79
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,600
I almost believe you.

80
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,200
That's enough for me.

81
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,800
And if i'm right in guessing
that you two are hiding out here

82
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,500
Because miss buckley would prefer
To keep her presence unknown...

83
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,700
Why search for a cab
and risk being seen?

84
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,300
Okay.

85
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm giving it back
in the morning.

86
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,700
Tripp, it's me.

87
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,300
Remember how we've always wanted
To do something about the buckleys?

88
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,800
I think i may have
found a way.

89
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,800
Excuse me.

90
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,800
Have you seen mr. Bass
anywhere?

91
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,700
You just missed him.
He left about five minutes ago.

92
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,500
Was he alone?

93
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,100
Well, there was a woman
who left about the same time.

94
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,400
Was she blonde?

95
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,000
Tall, stunning
And every man's fantasy?

96
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,500
<i>Spotted-- Blair waldorf learning
That just because you get out of the game</i>

97
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,500
<i>Doesn't mean someone isn't waiting
on the bench To take your place.</i>

98
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,700
I know stuff's going on
with your family, ??

99
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,100
???

100
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,600
Honestly, right now
i'm not sure.

101
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,600
Maybe people just change.
Maybe it okay if we grow apart.

102
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,800
Vanessa,
i'm--I'm not changing.

103
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,200
You're at a po match ???

104
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,500
And your name's
in the program.

105
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,200
And after i take a bus across
the state line to apologize,

106
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,700
You ditch me for blair waldorf
and totally disappear.

107
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,400
ece set me up with this suit,
And jenny got a dress, too,

108
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,100
If you'd also like to make her
feel bad about it. 

109
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,000
As for blair, It's not like we're
shoe shopping or sipping martinis.

110
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,500
There--Tre's something
going on with serena.

111
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
- And what is that?
- I-I wish i knew.

112
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,900
All i do know is that
lily's mother is very sick.

113
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,300
My dad is struggling keep it together,
Not to mention my family is--

114
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,400
Just generally in the middle Of a massive transition.

115
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,800
So, please, please, Give me a break
with the "rich people suck" thing.

116
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,700
I don't care if you'reich,
Which you aren't, by the way.

117
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,100
Ride in a limo, break a hundred.
That's fine. 

118
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,000
But if you're gonna be in this world,
Be yourself in this world,

119
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,800
'cause i actually like that guy,
And i hope he's the one who turns up at n.Y.U.

120
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,100
Huh.

121
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,500
What's so funny?

122
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,700
Old habits die hard.

123
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,400
Don't worry.
I'll... find my way.

124
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,700
Anybody seen
a girl in an orange dress?

125
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,500
Chuck! Where is she?

126
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,500
What are you talking about?

127
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,400
Do you really expect me to believe
You don't have her stashed here?

128
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,000
I came back from the party
because i had a headache.

129
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,500
Didn't you get my messages?

130
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,200
I must have left my phone
on the table.

131
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,600
What if we need games?

132
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,400
What if without them
we're boring?

133
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,300
We could never be boring.

134
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,900
You say that,
but i know you.

135
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,600
You're chuck bass.

136
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,800
I'm not chuck bass
without you.

137
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,700
Running to get here
all the way from connecticut...

138
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Was pretty exciting.

139
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,300
Do you know
where alexandra lives?

140
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,500
How about we stay in instead?

141
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,300
Well, that wasn't so much fun,
was it?

142
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,000
Depends on your definition
of fun.

143
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
I'm sorry i brought you.

144
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,400
The humphreys are
going through a lot,

145
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,900
And i don't even know if dan
and i are even still friends.

146
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,300
I know they're dealing
with stuff, um,

147
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,000
But they seem
like good people to me.

148
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,300
And you and dan have been
friends for so long,

149
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,000
Maybe you shouldn't write that
off because of one argument.

150
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,700
Let's not even
talk about it anymore.

151
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,500
Are you sure?

152
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,600
'Cause if you need
to talk...

153
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
I don't...

154
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,200
I think i've done
eough talking for one night.

155
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,100
And i thought one of us shld
finally make the first move,

156
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,900
Maybe turn this night around.

157
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,900
I'm glad you did.

158
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,400
<i>Growing up means one thing--
Independence.</i>

159
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,900
I'll be right back.

160
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,800
<i>We all want it.</i>

161
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,600
<i>Sometimes we use other people
to try to get it for ourselves.</i>

162
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:55,300
Waiter, this glass is dirty,
And i've been waiting far too long.

163
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,500
Well, i apologize, ma'am.

164
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,500
Surely there's some way i can
make up for the poor service.

165
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,400
I can think of a few ways.

166
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,700
<i>Sometimes we find it
in each other.</i>

167
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,800
<i>The party You are trying to reach
is not available at the moment.</i>

168
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,500
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

169
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,200
Hey, it's serena again.

170
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,600
I don't know if you're getting these messag
Or if you even check this number,

171
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,600
But i just want you to know That

172
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,800

to get your attention.

173
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,100
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
for however long. 

174
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,700
Bye.

175
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,900
<i>Sometimes our independence
Comes at the cost of something else...</i>

176
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,500
<i>And that cost can be high.</i>

177
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,000
I hope i'm doing
thright thing.

178
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,000
You wanted to keep serena out of the papers.
Dad, this is the way do it.

179
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
- You own all the pictures now.
- Oh, not all of them.

180
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:10,200
there is still one photographer
That my group hasn't been able reach yet.

181
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,200
<i>Because more often than not,</i>

182
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,600
<i>In order to gain
our independence,</i>

183
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,400
<i>We have to fight.</i>

184
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,200
Can you guartee that these
will run in europe and asia?

185
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,500
I'll try my best.

186
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,300
Good, 'cause i wanna make sure
My father sees these wherever he goes.

187
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,300
<i>Never give up.
Never surrender.</i>
