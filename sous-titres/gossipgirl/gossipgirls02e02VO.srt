00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,410
AND SHE ALWAYS SENDS THEM RUNNING.

333
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,120
IT'S LIKE--AND SHE GETS INSIDE THEIR HEADS,

334
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,630
FIGURES OUT THEIR WORST FEARS AND JUST---

335
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,190
RUTHLESSLY EXPLOITS THAT FEAR. IT'S ROUGH.

336
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,800
NONOTO MENTION,

337
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,570
SHE'S COMPLETELY GOT MY FATHER'S EAR.

338
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,420
OF COURSE,BLAIR IS DESPERATE TO M MT HER.

339
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,530
AND WHEN BLAIR SETS HER MIND ON SOMETHING...

340
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,020
EXACTLY.

341
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,040
THAT'S A MATCH.

342
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,080
I'D SAY LET'S KEEP AT IT,

343
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,670

THAT WAS A GOOD MATCH. YOU NEARLY HAD ME.

353
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,110

00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,090
THANK YOU,MISS BLAIR.

359
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,600
THIS GUEST LIST,HOWEVER,IS A COMPLETE PAGERIENDSDS

360
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,440
????

361
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,010
THEN INVITE STRANGERS.

362
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,700
I HAVE TO PRESENT MYSELF AS A CROWN JEWEL,

363
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,900
SURROUNDED BY OTHER SMALLER,SLSLHTLY FLAWED GEMS,

364
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,770
BUT QUALITY STONES NONETHELESS.

365
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,620
AND TRY TO ROUND UP A COUPLE PEOPLE WHO CAN VOTE

366
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,370
SO IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A TOTAL HIGH SCHOOL PARTY.Y.

367
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,190
A PARTY AT THE HUDSON,HUH?I GOT YOU

368

SINCE WHEN ARE YOU HAVING A PARTY?

369
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,390
SINCE IT BECAME CLEAR

370
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,510
THAT MARCUS DOES NOT THINK I I WORTHY OF MEETING HIS FAMILY. OH,MY GOD.

371
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,270
OBVIOUSLY I HAVE SOME MORE WORK TO DO.

372
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,430
B.,YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS. YES,I DO.

373
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,080
MARCUS DATED THE DESCENDANT OF PRINCESS GRACE.

374
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,870
HIS COCOORT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO HOST ROYAL DINNERS

375
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,990
AND HOBNOB WITH OLIGARCHS AND DICTATORS.

376
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,300
WELL,IF YOU CAN'T FIND COMMON GROUND WITH A DICTATOR,

377
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,470
I DON'N'KNOW WHO CAN. DAN LIKES SOCCER,RIGHT?

378
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,840
OR "FOOTBALL," AS MARCUS CALLS IT.

379
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,740
YOU THINK IT'D BE TOO WEIRD  HE CAME? UM,NO,NOT NECESSARILY.

00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,640
YOU ACTUALLY THINK DAN HAS A REDEEMING QUALITY?

382
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,610
AS LONG AS HE KNOWS HIS ARSE FROM HIS ARSENAL,

383
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,510
I THINK HE'S ACES. WELL,THTH COULD BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY

384
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,860
FOR US TO GET TOGETHER AND TALK.

385
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,940
YOU KNOW,I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE BREAKUP-- UGH! WHAT IS TO THINK ABOUT?T?

386

00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,200
Well,uh,no. The plan was deeply flawed.

416
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,780
I THINK WE OVERESTIMATED OUR POWERS OF RESTRAINT...

UM,I HAVE TO GO. I'LL BE BACK.

522
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,780
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO MEET MY FRIEND.

523
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:43,780
WHY? SO SHE CAN WARN ME ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF TOO MUCH BOTOX?

524
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,590
BLAIR,IS IT?

525
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,790

NICE TO MEET YOU.

529
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,500
(Wes Hutchinson) * NOW THAT IT'S ALL BEHIND ME *

530
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,350
A LITTLE SOON FOR FLOWERS,NO?

531
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,160
JUST A FEW FINISHING TOUCHES.

532
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,980
A MUCH BETTER JOB THAN I COULD'VE EVER DONE. YOU JUST WEREN'T HERE TO DO ITIT

533
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,680
SURE,BUT YOU WERE.

534
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,790
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO CONTINUE?

535
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,140
WHY? WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL DADA

536
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,110
I,UH,HAD A MEETING WITH TANYA D DELLY.

537
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,260
SHE HAS A COLLEGE TOUR COMIMI UP.

538
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,720

539
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,130
WHAT DO DAN AND JENNY THINK?

540
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,170
WELL,BEFORE I ASK THEM,

541
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,710
I WANTED TO SEE IF IT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE.

542
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,480
ALISON'S OPEN TO COMING BACK FOR A WHILE LONGER,

543
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,450
BUT I KNOW THAT SUMMER'S OVER,AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR R HOOLWORK.

544
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,980
YEAH,HOMESCHOOLING REALLY TIES ME UP.

545
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,270
IF,HOWEVER,YOU'RE ASKING

546
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:50,470
IF I DON'T MIND STSTKING AROUND WHILE YOU'RE AWAY,

547
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,940
IT'S NOT EXACTLY BRAIN SURGERY.

548
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,080
BUT ARE YOU REALLY SURE YOU WANNA LEAVE SO SOON?

549
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,680
WELL,IF I'M HONEST,I'M NOT SURE WHAT I WANT.

550
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,210
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY CHANCE

551
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,710
TO GET IT ALL OUT OF MY SYSTEM.

552
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,800
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW MUCH I MISSED IT.

553
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,270
I'M NOT DONE.

554
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:11,490
WOW. THAT <i>IS</i> HONEST.

555
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,810
WELL,WHATEVER YOU DECIDE,I LOVED FIXING UP THE PLACE,

556
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,320
AND I'D BE HAPPY TO STICK AROUND.

557
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,020
JUST LET ME KNOW.

558
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,050
THANKS.

559
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,710
COME ON. IF YOU REALLYLYIKE HIM,JUST APOLOGIZE.

560
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,980
WHAT GOOD WILL IT DO ME NOW?

561
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,920
DUCHESS?

562
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:33,760
I AM SO SORRY ABOUT WHAT I SAID ABOUOUTHE BOTOX.

563
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,010
YOUR WORK IS FLAWLESS.

564
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,830
LOOK,I KNOW YOU'RE HERE WITH CHUCK,

565
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,170
AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT HE'S SAID ABOUT ME--

566
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:47,900
LIMO SEX,,SOCIAL TORTURE OF FRESHMEN,BLACKMAIL.

567
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:52,160
BUT I ASSURE YOU,THERE IS AN EXPLANATION FOR ALL OF IT.

568
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,290
SAVE YOUR BREATH,BLAIR.

569
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,410
CHUCK DIDN'T TELL ME A THING.

570
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,530
OH. HE DIDN'T?

571
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,940
WAIT. HE--HE DIDN'T? I TOLD HIM NOT TO O THER.

572
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,120
NONE OF IT MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE TO ME,

573
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,030
BECAUSE NOTHING WILL CHANGE THE FACT

574
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,420
THAT DESPITE YOUR BEST EFFORTS--

575
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,830
WHICH ARE COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT,BY THE WAY--

576
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:13,650
MARCUS IS NEVER GOING TO END UP WITH A AOWLY WALDORF.

577
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,810
NATE.

578
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,140

00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,000
<i>WHAT'S THIS?</i>

00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,440
<i>NONO</i> THERE'S <i>A NOVEL</i>  <i>PLOT TWIST.</i>

590
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:57,570
THIS P PTY'S A COMPLETE BUST.

591
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,380
MY WHOLE LIFIFS A BUST.

592
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,830

00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,240
YOU WERE SCHEMING TO CONVINCE MARCUS

594
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,500
YOU'RE SOMEONE YOU'RE NOT.

595
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,670
BUT MY I IENTIONS WERE GOOD.

596
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,500
I REALLY DO LIKE HIM. I JUST...

597
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,330
AS SOON AS I KNEW HE LIKED ME,

598
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,170
I WOULD HAVE RELAXED AND DROPPED THE MANIPULATIVE PLOTTING

599
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,230
AND DEVOTED MYSELF TO BEING THE BEST GIRLFRIEND EVERER

600
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,530

00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,910
I MAY AS WELL HAVE GONE COMMANDO

606
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,760
AND HELD MY PARTY AT NYLA'S BURGER BASKET.

607
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,830
