1
00:00:00,327 --> 00:00:01,686
Gossip Girl here,

2
00:00:01,687 --> 00:00:03,182
Your one and only source

3
00:00:03,182 --> 00:00:05,503
Into the sandalous lives of manhattan's elite.

4
00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:06,767
Bart's been in an accident.

5
00:00:06,767 --> 00:00:10,001
My father turned his first profit by the time he was 22.

6
00:00:10,068 --> 00:00:11,623
I hope to do it by the time I'm 21.

7
00:00:11,624 --> 00:00:12,491
Oh, you're in love with her.

8
00:00:12,491 --> 00:00:14,091
- It's all over your face. - No.

9
00:00:14,157 --> 00:00:15,505
Blair told me you were responsible

10
00:00:15,505 --> 00:00:17,372
For sabotaging me at cotillion.

11
00:00:17,372 --> 00:00:19,567
Tripp is divorcing Maureen. We're going away together.

12
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:20,981
It is a huge mistake.

13
00:00:20,982 --> 00:00:23,103
You wanna talk to me about mistakes?

14
00:00:23,103 --> 00:00:24,848
You don't get to judge me.

15
00:00:26,153 --> 00:00:29,454
- Please don't get in the car. - Serena, you coming?

16
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:34,420
And who am I?

17
00:00:34,487 --> 00:00:37,721
That's a secret I'll never tell.

18
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,294
You know you love me.

19
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:43,459
X.O.X.O., gossip girl.

20
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:50,717
On lonely street

21
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,959
Little runaway girl

22
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:55,615
Do it again

23
00:00:55,615 --> 00:00:58,142
Do it again

24
00:00:58,142 --> 00:01:00,875
If you don't mind...

25
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,643
I do.

26
00:01:02,643 --> 00:01:05,458
Serena, I can't stand this.

27
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:11,715
I love you.

28
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:15,477
Tripp, everything is ruined, already

29
00:01:15,477 --> 00:01:17,009
It's too late.

30
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,177
Serena, it doesn't have to be,

31
00:01:23,282 --> 00:01:24,615
Tripp!

32
00:01:32,198 --> 00:01:35,220
They say that there are no accidents.

33
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,754
Sometimes, reality comes crashing into us.

34
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:41,687
Other times, it dawns on us slowly,

35
00:01:41,754 --> 00:01:43,953
Despite our best efforts to ignore it.

36
00:01:46,878 --> 00:01:48,921
Morning. I brought your favorite.

37
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:50,259
Oh, you're up.

38
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:50,723
I haven't been sleeping well.

39
00:01:50,723 --> 00:01:52,306
I know, hence the breakfast in bed...

40
00:01:52,306 --> 00:01:53,722
Which will taste just as good in the living room.

41
00:01:53,722 --> 00:01:56,266
I'm not hungry.

42
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,940
Stop trying to pretend, Chuck. I know why you're upset.

43
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,860
Today is a day like any other.

44
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,785
In fact, I'm going to a meeting.

45
00:02:03,785 --> 00:02:06,649
I'm looking at a property on the lower east side.

46
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:09,351
I can't be resting on my laurels.

47
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:11,642
The empire's doing well.

48
00:02:11,642 --> 00:02:12,480
It's time to look ahead.

49
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,739
Well, since I canceled my day,

50
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:17,911
I am now completely free, so I'm coming with you.

51
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:29,377
Hey. I thought you were getting

52
00:02:29,377 --> 00:02:30,830
ready for that co-op meeting.

53
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,542
Oh. Right.

54
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:34,661
It slipped my mind.

55
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,865
You cleaning out the closet again?

56
00:02:35,931 --> 00:02:38,486
I thought you did that yesterday and the day before.

57
00:02:38,486 --> 00:02:43,465
Well, Vanya has organized a clothing drive--

58
00:02:43,532 --> 00:02:45,965
"coats for Kiev."

59
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:48,578
Vanya's from Minsk.

60
00:02:48,578 --> 00:02:50,063
Lil, none of this is making much sense.

61
00:02:50,063 --> 00:02:51,710
Does this have something to do with serena?

62
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,732
What, other than the fact that she won't speak to me?

63
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:56,021
That she's holed up with some married politician,

64
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:58,511
Acting like some sort of teenage Rielle Hunter?

65
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,013
Well, if it's this upsetting, let's do something about it.

66
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:05,010
Where is she? Let's bring her back.

67
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,804
Would you represent us at the co-op meeting today?

68
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:09,585
It's about the rooftop garden.

69
00:03:09,585 --> 00:03:10,521
You know how strict

70
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:12,391
Those green people are about attendance.

71
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:15,189
If it'll help you out, I'm totally free.

72
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:17,641
I had a feeling you might say that.

73
00:03:18,872 --> 00:03:20,843
What's that supposed to mean?

74
00:03:25,235 --> 00:03:27,102
Nothing. I'm sorry.

75
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:28,793
Look, I know our family's going through a lot,

76
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:34,169
And I love... That you've made us your priority.

77
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:36,669
It's at park avenue autumn.

78
00:03:45,202 --> 00:03:47,968
No, no. Of course, sir. I'm thrilled.

79
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:50,769
I'll be in touch with an answer. Thanks again.

80
00:03:50,835 --> 00:03:52,770
You've been ducking work all week.

81
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,037
Who was important enough for you to finally take their call?

82
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:56,904
- Barney Frank. - Really?

83
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,237
He asked me to serve on the finance subcommittee.

84
00:03:59,304 --> 00:04:03,104
Oh! that's so exciting.

85
00:04:03,171 --> 00:04:05,603
Hey, maybe--maybe this will all blow over.

86
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,904
Unfortunately, it has to blow up before it blows over.

87
00:04:10,222 --> 00:04:12,851
It's only a matter of time before Maureen goes public.

88
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:15,564
And I can't hide out here forever.

89
00:04:15,564 --> 00:04:19,397
Well, if being together means everything will fall apart,

90
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:21,131
Then so be it.

91
00:04:21,197 --> 00:04:23,197
It'll be hard, but we'll figure it out,

92
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,764
Even if that means starting over.

93
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:27,798
Right.

94
00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:29,964
Starting over.

95
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:31,397
Hey.

96
00:04:34,864 --> 00:04:37,264
We'll get through this.

97
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,165
I'm gonna go into town and get some supplies.

98
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,230
No. Don't be too long.

99
00:04:56,798 --> 00:04:59,464
Um, this building is a homeless shelter.

100
00:05:00,864 --> 00:05:02,931
"a," gross, and "b," really?

101
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:05,364
I'm not a huge advocate of the downtrodden,

102
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:06,624
But I am a fan of not stepping

103
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,898
on them when I'm at John Derian.

104
00:05:07,964 --> 00:05:08,636
If you turn these into lofts,

105
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:10,123
Then where are they going to live?

106
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:13,387
I don't know, blair. One step at a time.

107
00:05:13,387 --> 00:05:15,570
The owner of the building's waiting inside with the specs.

108
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,264
I-I'm sorry.

109
00:05:16,264 --> 00:05:18,487
Far be it from me to be overcome with the holiday spirit,

110
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:19,654
But this whole scrooge act?

111
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:20,919
You should be at home today

112
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:23,829
Or laying flowers on your father's grave.

113
00:05:24,488 --> 00:05:27,373
I know today is the anniversary of his death.

114
00:05:33,702 --> 00:05:36,435
Why don't you take the car

115
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,369
And meet me at the hotel later for lunch?

116
00:05:39,435 --> 00:05:41,302
We'll have our quiet time then.

117
00:05:41,369 --> 00:05:42,636
Fine.

118
00:05:42,702 --> 00:05:45,235
Pretend like you never get sad

119
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:47,736
And all you care about is making more money.

120
00:05:47,802 --> 00:05:50,702
But just so we're clear, I know better.

121
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:55,135
And you, chuck bass, are not your father.

122
00:05:57,003 --> 00:05:58,435
I know.

123
00:06:04,302 --> 00:06:06,435
We make our own fortunes,

124
00:06:06,502 --> 00:06:09,235
And then call them fate.

125
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,235
Hey.

126
00:06:11,302 --> 00:06:13,769
Can you meet me right now?

127
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:17,168
I think we should talk.

128
00:06:17,235 --> 00:06:18,857
And what better excuse to choose a path

129
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:21,765
Than to insist it's our destiny?

130
00:06:26,003 --> 00:06:27,131
But at the end of the day,

131
00:06:27,131 --> 00:06:29,766
We all have to live with our choices...

132
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:32,255
You did the right thing, son.

133
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:39,036
No matter who's looking over our shoulder.

134
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:49,236
Spotted--an "it" girl with an "it" bag.

135
00:06:49,303 --> 00:06:51,354
Looks like the roadie to success

136
00:06:51,354 --> 00:06:54,270
Is paved with cruel intentions.

137
00:06:54,337 --> 00:06:56,203
- Can I hold the baby? - Oh, it's beautiful!

138
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,084
I've never seen one in the flesh.

139
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,462
Because it's not in stores yet.

140
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:01,291
Even the waiting list is still waiting.

141
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,796
I guess it pays to be Lily Bass' daughter.

142
00:07:03,796 --> 00:07:05,638
Well, her name is "humphrey" now,

143
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:08,034
And I got this through my own connections.

144
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,695
O.M.G.! Twins!

145
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:13,741
- You have the same bag!  - how did you get that?!

146
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:15,440
Well, great minds shop alike.

147
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,903
Although in the future, J, we should probably coordinate.

148
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:19,011
I'll take tuesdays and thursdays

149
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:20,858
And alternate wednesdays?

150
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,073
How about you take yours back to the store?

151
00:07:23,804 --> 00:07:26,030
You know I have first dibs on designer everything.

152
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,264
I'm--I'm sorry, Jenny.

153
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:29,821
But my mom brought this back for me from Paris.

154
00:07:29,821 --> 00:07:31,250
It had its own seat on the plane. Well,

155
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,834
since you apparently love your new bag

156
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:35,220
More than your old friends, I guess you can carry it...

157
00:07:36,805 --> 00:07:38,330
Across the street.

158
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,426
Enjoy being B.F.F.S with a hunk of leather.

159
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,087
So who wants to hold it first?

160
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:50,784
Okay, that was totally humiliating.

161
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:52,049
That was kind of the point.

162
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:54,203
If we wanna turn Carmen and Jane against Jenny,

163
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:55,372
We've gotta make them see that

164
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:56,987
she is the meanest queen ever.

165
00:07:56,987 --> 00:07:58,421
Consider the mission a success.

166
00:07:58,421 --> 00:08:00,399
I had to pinch myself to keep from crying.

167
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,455
I know it's hard, but you have to stick with the plan.

168
00:08:03,455 --> 00:08:05,887
- And if the plan doesn't work?  - If it does work,

169
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,849
We'll make sure you end up the new queen.

170
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:09,966
You better. But in the mean time...

171
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,888
I'm keepin' the bag.

172
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,990
Are you ready for phase two?

173
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:19,566
Olivia called it, you know.

174
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,544
I mean, and I was--I was too stupid or too stubborn

175
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:23,790
To realize that she was right about Vanessa.

176
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,417
And now my window's closed.

177
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:26,690
She's all off into

178
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:28,346
This Paul Hoffman

179
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:29,919
guy. Dan, do you really think

180
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,781
If you went toe-to-toe with paul hoffman

181
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:33,355
That you couldn't take him down?

182
00:08:33,355 --> 00:08:34,781
You're using him as an excuse.

183
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:38,269
No, no, he's a..he's a..he's a handsome guy, a sophomore.

184
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,546
He and vanessa have a lot in common.

185
00:08:39,546 --> 00:08:42,442
He's a douche. Listen, you have two options here--

186
00:08:42,442 --> 00:08:45,246
You can man up, go to war and fight for the girl you love,

187
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:48,400
Or just forget her and move on to a palate cleanser.

188
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,555
So you're saying my only choices are

189
00:08:49,555 --> 00:08:51,870
Extreme emotional vulnerability with a good friend,

190
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,305
Or meaningless sex with a stranger?

191
00:08:55,058 --> 00:08:56,533
- Yeah, pretty much. - All right.

192
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,591
Hi. We were just talking about you. Oh.

193
00:09:05,591 --> 00:09:08,085
Uh, we're going up to my country house this weekend,

194
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:11,004
And I wondered if you wanted to come. And there's a hot tub.

195
00:09:11,004 --> 00:09:14,633
It's kind of a writers retreat. And Paul's coming.

196
00:09:15,035 --> 00:09:17,675
Oh... you know, that sounds-- that sounds so tempting.

197
00:09:17,675 --> 00:09:19,476
But I think, um, I got a lot of homework

198
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,944
So I think I'm gonna stick around here.

199
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:25,037
Oh. Okay. I'll call you when we get back.

200
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:26,854
Okay. See ya.

201
00:09:27,663 --> 00:09:30,225
Dude, what was that? You should totally go.

202
00:09:30,225 --> 00:09:31,893
You can box paul out of the hot tub

203
00:09:32,313 --> 00:09:34,084
- Or get with Willa. - Willa?

204
00:09:34,084 --> 00:09:36,160
Oh, yeah, she's so cute. Look at her.

205
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,607
And she's a drama major. Actresses are crazy.

206
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:42,974
- Willa! - yeah?

207
00:09:42,974 --> 00:09:44,195
Yeah, you know what?

208
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:46,913
Um... on second thought, I'd love to go.

209
00:09:46,913 --> 00:09:49,053
- It sounds like fun. - Really?

210
00:09:49,365 --> 00:09:50,442
- Yeah. - Great.

211
00:09:50,442 --> 00:09:53,214
We're meeting at the dorms tonight. Come find me.

212
00:09:53,215 --> 00:09:53,743
Will do.

213
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:58,196
You're welcome.

214
00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:08,442
Looks like I won.

215
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,227
Hi, I'm rufus humphrey, lily's--

216
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:12,988
Husband. Hi. Holland Kemble.

217
00:10:13,384 --> 00:10:14,526
We'd been placing bets on when

218
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:16,357
you'd show up, and I had today.

219
00:10:17,305 --> 00:10:21,436
Oh, why? Did Bart used to come to these meetings?

220
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:23,321
Nope. Not once.

221
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:25,655
But an attractive man like yourself

222
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:28,406
Moves into the building... based on your comings and goings,

223
00:10:28,406 --> 00:10:31,761
It doesn't seem like you have a boardroom to run

224
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:32,949
Or a hedge fund to manage,

225
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:34,385
So we figured it was just a matter of time.

226
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:35,980
I-I-I think you have the wrong idea.

227
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,604
I'm not some sort of trophy husband.

228
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,360
My family's just in transition.

229
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,534
It's okay. We all sacrifice our independence for love.

230
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:46,449
At first it seems totally worth it.

231
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:48,466
It's just later after you've given everything up

232
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:50,664
That you realize you have nothing left to offer.

233
00:10:50,664 --> 00:10:53,305
That's when your husband starts banging his yoga teacher.

234
00:10:54,956 --> 00:10:56,155
Sorry.

235
00:10:56,735 --> 00:10:58,570
That was probably an overshare.

236
00:11:00,564 --> 00:11:02,985
Ladies and gentleman,

237
00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:04,779
Let's begin.

238
00:11:10,951 --> 00:11:12,111
You said you were getting groceries.

239
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:13,080
Where are you?

240
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:15,770
I'm with my grandfather, actually.

241
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:17,835
He got wind of what was going down and called.

242
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:20,772
Honestly, I'm relieved to get his advice.

243
00:11:20,772 --> 00:11:22,347
Well, I'm glad you're working things out,

244
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:24,314
But you left me alone.

245
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:26,040
And there's no coffee or cable.

246
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,329
And I came here to be with you.

247
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:29,737
I know, and I so appreciate you being patient.

248
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:33,764
You're there for me 100%, and I'm the one who's a mess.

249
00:11:33,764 --> 00:11:34,746
True.

250
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,427
But your life is pretty complicated,

251
00:11:38,427 --> 00:11:40,842
And I knew what I was getting myself into.

252
00:11:40,842 --> 00:11:43,249
Thank you for understanding.

253
00:11:44,252 --> 00:11:45,327
I'll see you tonight.

254
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:47,271
Wait, tonight?

255
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:53,591
Deep breath, Tripp.

256
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:56,140
If we handle this right, you'll be able to keep

257
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,276
The career you worked so hard for

258
00:11:58,276 --> 00:12:00,217
And get the woman of your dreams,

259
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:01,835
And I'll still have my marriage.

260
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:04,475
- Why are you okay with this? - We both share

261
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:06,664
A dream we're not willing to give up on.

262
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,136
I was hoping you'd come to your senses, and now you have.

263
00:12:11,876 --> 00:12:13,555
I do care about my career,

264
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:16,494
But not as much as I care about Serena.

265
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,428
I just wanna make sure I'm being clear about that.

266
00:12:19,428 --> 00:12:23,229
It's my personal opinion that Serena is just a phase.

267
00:12:23,588 --> 00:12:24,454
A few years from now,

268
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:26,871
We'll look back and all this will be a faded memory.

269
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:31,054
Well, that's where our opinions diverge.

270
00:12:31,054 --> 00:12:32,706
I'm willing to take that chance.

271
00:12:32,706 --> 00:12:35,671
I guess now we see if Serena's willing to bet against you.

272
00:12:35,895 --> 00:12:39,617
I'm thinking a personal appeal, woman-to-woman.

273
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:57,578
I liked what I saw today.

274
00:12:58,776 --> 00:13:00,942
Seems like the right property at the right time.

275
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:02,168
You have the cash.

276
00:13:03,595 --> 00:13:04,975
You should've signed at the site,

277
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:06,712
Be moving forward by now.

278
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:10,631
There's just a few things I need to figure out first.

279
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:12,720
Like the building's residents?

280
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,282
They're not your concern.

281
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:16,657
And if you want the write-off for '09,

282
00:13:16,657 --> 00:13:19,350
You need to be breaking ground by the new year, so...

283
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:21,545
Ho ho homeless.

284
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:25,229
No disrespect,

285
00:13:25,817 --> 00:13:27,991
But I don't need your advice.

286
00:13:27,991 --> 00:13:30,014
I've been doing pretty well without you.

287
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,209
Oh, yeah.

288
00:13:35,243 --> 00:13:37,040
The empire.

289
00:13:39,857 --> 00:13:41,637
Nice hotel.

290
00:13:41,637 --> 00:13:42,815
Thank you.

291
00:13:43,044 --> 00:13:44,380
But to be honest,

292
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:46,081
I haven't seen anything in the last year

293
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:48,463
That suggest you have what it takes.

294
00:13:50,084 --> 00:13:51,295
If anything.

295
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,902
You've been a disappointment.

296
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:01,487
You opened your heart to Blair,

297
00:14:02,256 --> 00:14:04,142
And it made you weak.

298
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:05,421
You cannot be

299
00:14:05,421 --> 00:14:08,771
One person at work and another one at home.

300
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,854
If you're soft, you're soft.

301
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,390
And well, let's face it--

302
00:14:15,768 --> 00:14:17,701
You're soft.

303
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,029
"I love you, too."

304
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,392
Hey, I'm sorry to call.

305
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:38,791
I know you probably don't wanna

306
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,864
hear from me after Thanksgiving.

307
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:42,594
No. No, of course I do.

308
00:14:42,594 --> 00:14:43,921
I've been thinking about you.

309
00:14:44,707 --> 00:14:45,852
Just worried.

310
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:48,283
Is everything okay? Where's Tripp?

311
00:14:48,283 --> 00:14:51,183
He's out. I'm at the cottage, and the heat died.

312
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:52,386
I know you've been here before.

313
00:14:52,386 --> 00:14:53,845
So do you know how to restart it?

314
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:57,665
You know, I've actually, um,

315
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:59,463
only been there over the summer.

316
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:01,642
I don't...I don't know how to help you.

317
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:03,284
Okay, heat is optional,

318
00:15:03,284 --> 00:15:07,185
But please tell me there's a microwave or Wi-fi.

319
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:09,502
I'm--I'm starved and bored out of my mind.

320
00:15:09,502 --> 00:15:11,130
Ever read "the old man and the sea"?

321
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,153
I prefer Fitzgerald to Hemingway.

322
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,781
Yeah, I've never read it either,

323
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,027
But go look for it on the bookshelf.

324
00:15:17,027 --> 00:15:18,829
It's blue with a yellow bookmark.

325
00:15:22,906 --> 00:15:27,084
Oh! And the location of your secret boyhood pot stash.

326
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:29,300
Just don't tell grandfather.

327
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:30,855
Tripp and I hid it there a couple of summers ago,

328
00:15:30,855 --> 00:15:32,123
So it might be a little dusty,

329
00:15:32,123 --> 00:15:33,435
But it's the best I can do

330
00:15:33,436 --> 00:15:34,628
Till Tripp gets back.

331
00:15:35,356 --> 00:15:38,495
- Where is he, anyway? - Actually, he's with your grandfather

332
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:43,025
Getting advice on the difficult days ahead. Nate?

333
00:15:43,345 --> 00:15:46,332
Yeah, just, um... listen, stay warm,

334
00:15:46,332 --> 00:15:47,892
And if you need anything else, just give me a buzz.

335
00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:48,965
Like a lighter?

336
00:15:50,226 --> 00:15:52,847
Hey, I'm...I'm really glad we can still talk.

337
00:15:52,847 --> 00:15:55,131
- Yeah, me, too. - Bye.

338
00:15:58,396 --> 00:15:59,616
Hello, Serena.

339
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:03,555
Maureen. You have no reason to be here.

340
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:05,245
Get out or I'll call Tripp.

341
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:06,837
Who do you think told me you were here?

342
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:09,301
Tripp and I aren't getting divorced.

343
00:16:09,631 --> 00:16:11,614
You can have him in private,

344
00:16:11,615 --> 00:16:13,763
But I get him in public.

345
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:17,400
He keeps his career, I keep my pride and position,

346
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:18,967
And you get...

347
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:21,439
Whatever you're getting.

348
00:16:21,602 --> 00:16:23,502
Screwed, I think they call it.

349
00:16:24,174 --> 00:16:27,330
Y-you're asking me to be your husband's mistress?

350
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,532
It's a time-honored political tradition.

351
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:32,325
I'm Jackie. You're Marilyn.

352
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:35,486
I love Tripp, and I'd do anything to make him happy.

353
00:16:35,486 --> 00:16:37,723
What makes him happy is being with me.

354
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,582
I know Tripp would never send you here.

355
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,249
He knows that I wouldn't agree with this.

356
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:43,889
He was skeptical, it's true.

357
00:16:44,657 --> 00:16:47,941
But he didn't know that I have this.

358
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:53,891
Where'd you get that?

359
00:16:53,891 --> 00:16:56,564
The more relevant question is what your stepfather will say

360
00:16:56,564 --> 00:16:58,602
When he finds out your mother is a cheating whore.

361
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,542
Your mother and father alone in his hotel room...

362
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:03,587
What do you think they were doing?

363
00:17:04,885 --> 00:17:06,652
I don't know. The letter doesn't say.

364
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:09,539
Knowing Lily, I think we can assume the worst.

365
00:17:09,966 --> 00:17:11,837
I'm pretty sure Rufus will.

366
00:17:14,485 --> 00:17:15,339
Okay, then.

367
00:17:15,956 --> 00:17:17,148
You think about my offer.

368
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:18,361
Honestly, with this letter,

369
00:17:18,361 --> 00:17:20,433
I could've forced you out of the picture altogether.

370
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:23,765
But it's not what Tripp wants, so I'm being pragmatic.

371
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:28,273
I hope you'll decide to do the same.

372
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:42,909
I thought you were meeting me for lunch.

373
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:44,672
I had too much to drink.

374
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:46,080
Oh. Well...

375
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:49,553
We'll just order room service.

376
00:17:49,553 --> 00:17:53,475
Look, I really don't need you to take care of me.

377
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,389
I know...

378
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,815
How hard it was for you to let your guard down

379
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:04,832
To let me in.

380
00:18:07,217 --> 00:18:09,270
But you've changed.

381
00:18:17,616 --> 00:18:19,215
I'm buying that building.

382
00:18:19,622 --> 00:18:20,416
Chuck...

383
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,799
- Don't tell me what to do. - I'm not.

384
00:18:24,428 --> 00:18:26,269
Just talk to me.

385
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,375
Blair...

386
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:37,199
I need you to get out of here now.

387
00:18:38,002 --> 00:18:39,220
Chuck.

388
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:43,292
Now.

389
00:18:57,979 --> 00:19:00,157
Maybe there's hope for you yet.

390
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:05,166
You know, Jenny said that if she was chosen to be queen,

391
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:05,974
Then things would be better,

392
00:19:05,974 --> 00:19:08,233
But if you think about it, things are actually kinda worse.

393
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:10,924
Blair never banished a girl for getting a gift.

394
00:19:10,924 --> 00:19:12,626
It is almost Christmas.

395
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:14,364
Right. There could be wish list carnage.

396
00:19:15,101 --> 00:19:16,448
Think about it.

397
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:21,323
Did someone mention christmas? Happy holidays, ladies.

398
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,744
See, that's why I was so mad at Sawyer,

399
00:19:23,744 --> 00:19:25,937
Cause she ruined the surprise.

400
00:19:25,937 --> 00:19:27,863
It's Y.S.L. For everyone.

401
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:29,889
O.M.G.B.G.E.!

402
00:19:29,889 --> 00:19:32,640
Oh, my god! Best gift ever! I love you!

403
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,802
I love you, too!

404
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:38,878
Jenny, where did you even get the money?

405
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,344
My mom's generous, but she wouldn't give you

406
00:19:40,344 --> 00:19:42,755
The price of a smart car to spend on purses.

407
00:19:43,272 --> 00:19:46,224
Come on, ladies. Let's go buy matching lipstick.

408
00:19:53,528 --> 00:19:54,931
Chuck's having such a difficult day,

409
00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:56,546
And since I'm sure you are, too,

410
00:19:56,546 --> 00:19:58,287
I thought you might have some words of advice.

411
00:19:58,564 --> 00:19:59,824
Cyrus says it's an essential

412
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,333
part of life, honoring the dead.

413
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,889
But Chuck refuses to visit Bart's grave even today.

414
00:20:06,502 --> 00:20:09,005
On the anniversary of his death.

415
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:11,951
Do you know that Chuck's never

416
00:20:11,951 --> 00:20:14,179
been to his mother's grave once?

417
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,393
I can understand not going on the date she died...

418
00:20:16,393 --> 00:20:17,584
It is his birthday after all...

419
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:21,144
But Bart refused to tell him where Evelyn was even buried,

420
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:24,288
Said it was morbid for a child to visit a cemetery.

421
00:20:27,052 --> 00:20:28,377
Lily? Mm.

422
00:20:29,003 --> 00:20:31,522
- Are you listening? - Yes, of course I am, Blair.

423
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,715
And I will go see Charles and talk to him.

424
00:20:34,715 --> 00:20:35,761
Thank you.

425
00:20:38,718 --> 00:20:40,071
Hello, Mr. Humphrey.

426
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,312
Blair. What brings you here?

427
00:20:42,523 --> 00:20:45,396
I was just looking for backup from Lily.

428
00:20:45,396 --> 00:20:47,421
Bart's 1-year mark.

429
00:20:48,937 --> 00:20:49,754
Oh. Lil, why didn't you say something?

430
00:20:49,754 --> 00:20:51,553
No wonder you're so upset today.

431
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:54,453
Bart's death was such a tough time.

432
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,367
Thank you for standing by me. Mm.

433
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,918
I don't know what I would ever do if I lost you.

434
00:20:59,918 --> 00:21:01,879
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

435
00:21:05,093 --> 00:21:06,717
It's not that I believe Maureen,

436
00:21:06,717 --> 00:21:09,741
But Tripp hasn't returned any of my texts or messages,

437
00:21:09,741 --> 00:21:11,237
And I need to talk to him.

438
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:12,637
I think that you should be open

439
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:15,872
To the idea that at least some of what Maureen was saying

440
00:21:15,872 --> 00:21:17,717
- Might be true. - Why would you say that?

441
00:21:17,717 --> 00:21:19,757
I've risked everything to be with Tripp.

442
00:21:19,757 --> 00:21:23,451
I have to have faith. Your grandfather just loves to talk.

443
00:21:23,451 --> 00:21:26,116
Tripp will be home soon, and he'll explain everything.

444
00:21:26,116 --> 00:21:28,157
Serena, my grandfather's in Bermuda.

445
00:21:28,656 --> 00:21:30,707
What? When we got off the phone earlier,

446
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,081
I called my mom, just to be sure.

447
00:21:33,244 --> 00:21:35,044
I don't know where Tripp is, but he's lying

448
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,845
- to you. - Will you excuse me? I have to go.

449
00:21:37,845 --> 00:21:42,105
Look likes the love nest has become a hornet's nest...

450
00:21:42,105 --> 00:21:44,311
Sir, how long till we get to Nassau county?

451
00:21:44,311 --> 00:21:47,336
And here comes Nate to stir it up.

452
00:21:49,562 --> 00:21:50,453
Come in.

453
00:21:55,995 --> 00:21:57,976
I, um, I'm ready to go. So I don't know if you got a car

454
00:21:57,976 --> 00:21:59,106
Or we're taking the train or what.

455
00:21:59,107 --> 00:22:02,508
I told Paul and Vanessa we'd be a while.

456
00:22:04,632 --> 00:22:06,129
I'd like your thoughts on something

457
00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:07,606
While we're still alone.

458
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:10,974
Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure. What is it?

459
00:22:10,974 --> 00:22:13,047
It's a performance art piece I did.

460
00:22:13,438 --> 00:22:16,028
It's kind of Karen Finley meets

461
00:22:16,028 --> 00:22:17,631
Daryl Hannah in "Legal Eagles,"

462
00:22:17,631 --> 00:22:18,668
But without...

463
00:22:19,115 --> 00:22:20,373
Clothing.

464
00:22:20,787 --> 00:22:22,145
You're, uh...

465
00:22:23,283 --> 00:22:24,722
You're naked there.

466
00:22:33,548 --> 00:22:35,049
Hello, Charles.

467
00:22:35,612 --> 00:22:36,437
How are you?

468
00:22:36,437 --> 00:22:39,516
Busy. I told the front desk not to bother sending you up.

469
00:22:39,516 --> 00:22:40,555
I'm on my way out.

470
00:22:40,555 --> 00:22:41,284
Well, wherever you're going,

471
00:22:41,284 --> 00:22:43,046
Will you put it off for a few hours

472
00:22:43,046 --> 00:22:44,817
And come with me to the cemetery?

473
00:22:44,817 --> 00:22:45,990
I can't. It's business.

474
00:22:47,516 --> 00:22:50,464
Well, we both know that your father was a complicated man.

475
00:22:51,261 --> 00:22:52,954
And I honestly think that he thought

476
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,999
It was just easier to be alone. And you know what?

477
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,361
There are moments that I think I agree with him.

478
00:22:58,361 --> 00:23:02,335
But we're not that way, I'm afraid. We need each other.

479
00:23:03,196 --> 00:23:06,367
And right now, I need you

480
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:08,385
To do this with me.

481
00:23:08,976 --> 00:23:10,060
I'm sorry, Lily,

482
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,172
But I believe

483
00:23:11,173 --> 00:23:15,067
The way to honor my father is to work.

484
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,316
Sometimes we need to do something

485
00:23:17,316 --> 00:23:19,093
To show people how we feel,

486
00:23:19,629 --> 00:23:22,309
Even when they're not here to see it.

487
00:23:24,413 --> 00:23:26,442
Oh, I'm sorry. It's Serena.

488
00:23:26,597 --> 00:23:27,634
Excuse me.

489
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:30,616
Mom, it's me.

490
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,654
Serena, are you okay? You sound upset.

491
00:23:32,654 --> 00:23:34,109
I'll be fine, eventually.

492
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:36,616
I know how mad you are that I chose to go with Tripp

493
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:38,651
- Rather than following your advice.  - Well, I

494
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:41,173
never wanted to punish you, just protect you.

495
00:23:41,173 --> 00:23:42,307
You don't need to explain.

496
00:23:42,307 --> 00:23:46,693
Right now... I just need my mom. Okay?

497
00:23:46,857 --> 00:23:48,226
Of course, darling.

498
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,183
Maureen has my letter from dad.

499
00:23:52,393 --> 00:23:53,398
What?

500
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:54,413
I don't know how she got it,

501
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:55,808
But she doesn't want to leave Tripp,

502
00:23:55,808 --> 00:23:57,884
And she's threatening to show it to Rufus.

503
00:23:57,884 --> 00:23:59,545
Oh, my god.

504
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:01,821
What does Tripp say?

505
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:03,555
I don't know, because I can't get in touch with him.

506
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:04,773
And it doesn't matter anyway,

507
00:24:04,773 --> 00:24:06,891
Because I know he's lying to me.

508
00:24:06,891 --> 00:24:08,935
Oh, Serena, I'm so sorry for that letter

509
00:24:08,935 --> 00:24:10,595
And what happened with your father.

510
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,239
I'll tell Rufus everything,

511
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:15,032
Which I should have done already.

512
00:24:15,032 --> 00:24:16,074
Look, just get home,

513
00:24:16,074 --> 00:24:19,379
And we'll fix everything, okay? I promise.

514
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,525
Thank you, mom. I love you.

515
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:24,611
I love you, too.

516
00:24:33,504 --> 00:24:35,085
So much for the day of the dead.

517
00:24:35,085 --> 00:24:38,643
Yes, I'm afraid I have to attend to the living right now.

518
00:24:39,734 --> 00:24:41,613
Look, I hope you'll consider what I said,

519
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,271
Maybe do this for both of us.

520
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:54,949
They should be yellow roses. They were my mother's favorite.

521
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,006
Serena, where are you going?

522
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:08,696
Away from you, liar. I'll find a cab.

523
00:25:08,696 --> 00:25:09,725
Serena, wait.

524
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:11,146
Tell me it isn't true.

525
00:25:11,464 --> 00:25:12,958
Tell me that you're getting a divorce,

526
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:15,653
That you spent the entire day talking to your grandfather

527
00:25:15,653 --> 00:25:17,058
And that you didn't send Maureen here,

528
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:18,897
And Nate is just jealous.

529
00:25:21,861 --> 00:25:23,879
I can't even look at you.

530
00:25:24,538 --> 00:25:26,193
Serena, let me at least drive you.

531
00:25:26,453 --> 00:25:28,688
I'll take you back to the city. We can talk in the car.

532
00:25:28,688 --> 00:25:33,354
You know... I want to be with you more than anything.

533
00:25:34,874 --> 00:25:35,958
Please.

534
00:25:36,247 --> 00:25:37,710
Let me explain.

535
00:25:38,068 --> 00:25:40,223
I'll get in the car, but no talking.

536
00:25:40,698 --> 00:25:42,429
I'm done talking.

537
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:46,397
Dream, little girl

538
00:25:46,464 --> 00:25:49,631
On lonely street

539
00:25:49,697 --> 00:25:52,998
Little runaway girl

540
00:25:53,064 --> 00:25:54,464
Do it again

541
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:57,163
Do it again

542
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:01,753
Tripp!

543
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:08,664
Run, run, run away, little girl

544
00:26:08,731 --> 00:26:11,397
Get your fun in this trashy world

545
00:26:11,464 --> 00:26:14,631
Empty-hearted boys by your side

546
00:26:14,697 --> 00:26:18,764
Lick your lips and... suicide

547
00:26:41,814 --> 00:26:42,706
Maureen?

548
00:26:43,153 --> 00:26:44,592
Something terrible's happened.

549
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:46,397
I need help.

550
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,849
Oh my god

551
00:27:11,032 --> 00:27:11,951
Serena!

552
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:14,957
What happened?

553
00:27:14,957 --> 00:27:16,007
Where's tripp?

554
00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:16,579
Tripp?

555
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:18,274
Is he okay?

556
00:27:18,743 --> 00:27:20,233
No, Serena, Tripp's not here.

557
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:21,553
He was driving.

558
00:27:55,527 --> 00:27:57,405
This is Tripp. Leave a message.

559
00:27:57,405 --> 00:27:58,339
Tripp?

560
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:01,303
I need to see you right now.

561
00:28:01,303 --> 00:28:03,601
You meet me at the hospital or I'm going to the cops.

562
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:11,666
What is that heavenly smell?

563
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:14,186
I am christening the kitchen with a little bolognese.

564
00:28:14,186 --> 00:28:16,252
I figured you could use some comfort food today.

565
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:18,064
Are the kids home yet?

566
00:28:19,413 --> 00:28:20,192
Not yet.

567
00:28:20,835 --> 00:28:23,640
Well, since we have a little alone time,

568
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,303
There's something I want to tell you.

569
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:26,294
Sounds serious.

570
00:28:26,294 --> 00:28:27,257
It is.

571
00:28:30,781 --> 00:28:33,717
Oh, god. It's 5-1-6. It might be serena.

572
00:28:34,415 --> 00:28:35,434
Hello?

573
00:28:43,785 --> 00:28:46,004
Mm. Mm. I'm...I'm s..I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

574
00:28:46,004 --> 00:28:49,445
It's 100% me. It's not you, you know.

575
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:52,197
Um, and your...this performance thing is amazing.

576
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:55,792
You're..you're a-a great kisser.

577
00:28:55,792 --> 00:28:57,248
Uh, I just..oh.

578
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,553
You know what? I gotta...I gotta take this. I'm sorry.

579
00:29:10,452 --> 00:29:12,096
- Serena's been in a car accident. - What?

580
00:29:12,096 --> 00:29:13,776
Yeah. I-I don't know much, but we gotta go.

581
00:29:15,123 --> 00:29:16,076
What happened?

582
00:29:17,058 --> 00:29:18,417
Wait. Where are you going?

583
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:21,739
- I'll explain on the way. Come on. - What?

584
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,970
What now, Blair?

585
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,779
I'll see you there.

586
00:29:33,697 --> 00:29:37,362
Arthur, change of destination. We're going to Nassau county.

587
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:40,891
What are you doing?

588
00:29:41,536 --> 00:29:42,909
We're almost there.

589
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:44,696
Everyone's waiting.

590
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:46,319
I'm sure they're gonna have a backup offer lined up.

591
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,641
Would you just leave me alone?!

592
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,488
You get to the L.I.E.

593
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,627
Stop looking at me.

594
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,114
What were you thinking, Tripp?

595
00:30:10,114 --> 00:30:12,392
Have you seen her? Is serena okay?

596
00:30:12,392 --> 00:30:14,586
You left her alone in a wrecked car

597
00:30:14,587 --> 00:30:16,105
And you moved her?

598
00:30:17,427 --> 00:30:20,550
What happened to you, man? You know, you were--

599
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,324
You were the good guy. You were the honest one.

600
00:30:22,324 --> 00:30:23,339
Nate, you've gotta understand--

601
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:26,224
- Oh, I fully understand. - I called 9-1-1.

602
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,691
Oh, come on. Are you serious?

603
00:30:30,657 --> 00:30:31,479
Look, I know we're family,

604
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:33,979
But what you did is unforgivable.

605
00:30:33,979 --> 00:30:35,048
When the cops start asking questions,

606
00:30:35,048 --> 00:30:36,370
I'm telling them the truth.

607
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,012
The truth is that Tripp was with me.

608
00:30:38,664 --> 00:30:40,077
I told you to stay in the car.

609
00:30:40,077 --> 00:30:41,632
I think the days of you telling me what to do

610
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:43,468
Are behind us, don't you?

611
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:45,053
I've spoken to William.

612
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:46,776
He's got Tripp's back on this one.

613
00:30:46,776 --> 00:30:48,120
If anyone starts asking questions,

614
00:30:48,443 --> 00:30:49,410
I'm ready with a statement

615
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,790
That says Tripp was with me all night.

616
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,029
What about serena's statement?

617
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:54,076
With her history of drinking and drugs,

618
00:30:54,377 --> 00:30:56,030
Not to mention her unstable family background

619
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,788
And the many, many men...

620
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,719
In any case, your grandfather is very well liked

621
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:03,695
By the sheriff's department around here.

622
00:31:06,913 --> 00:31:08,495
Coming, Tripp?

623
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:19,064
I'd love to see her. You don't think you could help me get...

624
00:31:20,368 --> 00:31:23,872
Spotted-- the fall of a politician...

625
00:31:23,872 --> 00:31:25,650
You stay the hell away from her.

626
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,778
And the rise of a hero.

627
00:31:28,575 --> 00:31:32,262
Poor congressman. You've been vetoed.

628
00:31:35,614 --> 00:31:37,710
I am so sorry.

629
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,287
I guess I had to learn the hard way.

630
00:31:40,287 --> 00:31:42,375
Well, like mother, like daughter.

631
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,746
Is Rufus here?

632
00:31:46,912 --> 00:31:48,608
Well, um, he's coming,

633
00:31:48,608 --> 00:31:50,922
But I asked him to look for your health insurance papers.

634
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:52,184
They're somewhere in my desk.

635
00:31:52,184 --> 00:31:54,621
Mom, my insurance card is in my wallet.

636
00:31:56,288 --> 00:31:57,699
You didn't tell him, did you?

637
00:31:57,699 --> 00:31:59,294
Well, I was going to,

638
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:01,000
And then the hospital called.

639
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,792
And, um, with Maureen and who knows what else,

640
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:06,176
I didn't know what we'd be walking into here.

641
00:32:10,413 --> 00:32:12,389
I-I just need to rest now.

642
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:13,540
Please.

643
00:32:15,913 --> 00:32:16,993
Okay.

644
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:33,684
- Hi.  - Hi.

645
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,384
Nice outfit.

646
00:32:35,451 --> 00:32:36,784
You, too.

647
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,345
You were so right about this one.

648
00:33:01,505 --> 00:33:03,136
What are you doing out here?

649
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:04,433
Come on.

650
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:20,034
I'm sorry, Mrs. Bass.

651
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:25,301
Charles, the doctors say there's nothing more they can do.

652
00:33:25,892 --> 00:33:27,550
We have to let him go.

653
00:33:30,136 --> 00:33:31,360
Chuck, stay.

654
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,727
Be here with us.

655
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,351
How's Serena?

656
00:34:01,363 --> 00:34:02,921
She's gonna be okay.

657
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:06,671
Lily's here?

658
00:34:06,943 --> 00:34:07,862
Eric's here?

659
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,146
Everyone's here.

660
00:34:13,294 --> 00:34:14,172
Chuck?

661
00:34:17,551 --> 00:34:21,851
My father always thought I was weak.

662
00:34:25,017 --> 00:34:27,551
And in the moment that mattered most, I was.

663
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,784
I couldn't be there when he, uh...

664
00:34:34,817 --> 00:34:38,650
I left, ran away.

665
00:34:38,717 --> 00:34:40,650
I've been...

666
00:34:40,717 --> 00:34:43,917
Pushing myself

667
00:34:43,984 --> 00:34:46,151
To prove him wrong, and...

668
00:34:48,817 --> 00:34:50,750
Been pushing you away.

669
00:34:54,984 --> 00:34:58,084
I don't think you ran away

670
00:34:58,151 --> 00:35:02,418
Because you couldn't handle death.

671
00:35:02,485 --> 00:35:06,151
I think it's because you couldn't handle feelings.

672
00:35:06,218 --> 00:35:08,351
But you're not like that anymore.

673
00:35:08,418 --> 00:35:10,917
You're strong.

674
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:12,784
You carry people.

675
00:35:12,851 --> 00:35:15,717
You carry me.

676
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:22,650
You're becoming a man in a way that...

677
00:35:22,717 --> 00:35:25,218
Your father never was.

678
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,218
Come.

679
00:35:40,617 --> 00:35:42,384
Let's say good-bye.

680
00:36:09,784 --> 00:36:12,784
You always

681
00:36:15,984 --> 00:36:17,851
Thank you.

682
00:36:22,585 --> 00:36:24,084
You want a sip of my coffee?

683
00:36:24,084 --> 00:36:27,824
- No, thanks.  - I was just offering.

684
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:30,216
Just declining the offer.

685
00:36:33,242 --> 00:36:34,251
Eric, I'm sorry.

686
00:36:34,252 --> 00:36:35,177
Jenny, can we stop this?

687
00:36:39,547 --> 00:36:41,913
So I'm assuming you set sawyer up with that bag.

688
00:36:41,913 --> 00:36:43,489
Me and Kira, yeah.

689
00:36:44,444 --> 00:36:46,871
I heard you talking to that shopgirl on the phone.

690
00:36:47,817 --> 00:36:49,651
I knew you were listening to that call.

691
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:52,011
Which is why you were ready with the bags for Jane and Carmen.

692
00:36:52,011 --> 00:36:53,522
You are starting to scare me.

693
00:36:53,522 --> 00:36:56,372
Right back at ya. And I wouldn't have had to do it

694
00:36:56,372 --> 00:36:58,339
If it wasn't for your smear campaign.

695
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:00,394
Which you totally deserved.

696
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,853
Hey, truce?

697
00:37:04,853 --> 00:37:06,930
Yeah. Come on. Let's go buy serena

698
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,297
One of those hideous stuffed bears at the gift shop

699
00:37:09,297 --> 00:37:11,076
With the "get well soon" balloon.

700
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:18,191
Maureen, hi.

701
00:37:18,191 --> 00:37:20,899
I-I-I'm actually on my way out.

702
00:37:20,899 --> 00:37:22,791
I know you must be surprised to see me,

703
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:24,649
But if you have a moment...

704
00:37:24,962 --> 00:37:27,944
I've been having some difficulties in my marriage,

705
00:37:27,944 --> 00:37:29,711
And I'd hate to see anyone

706
00:37:29,711 --> 00:37:32,122
Suffer through the same pain that I have.

707
00:37:32,122 --> 00:37:33,535
I don't know what you're talking about.

708
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:38,822
Somehow this ended up in my coat pocket at thanksgiving.

709
00:37:41,757 --> 00:37:43,480
Just read it.

710
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:51,853
I mean, imagine if Serena would have hit her head

711
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,666
A little harder or the car rolled or the--

712
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:55,512
Vanessa...

713
00:38:01,844 --> 00:38:03,164
I love you.

714
00:38:03,854 --> 00:38:05,420
I love you, too.

715
00:38:13,926 --> 00:38:14,908
Dan.

716
00:38:17,144 --> 00:38:19,159
That was not the reaction I was hoping for.

717
00:38:22,231 --> 00:38:26,379
Dan, sometimes when people are under a lot of emotional stress,

718
00:38:27,378 --> 00:38:29,571
They say things that they don't really mean.

719
00:38:29,571 --> 00:38:32,265
Yeah, I was, uh, I-I-I think I-I read that somewhere.

720
00:38:34,425 --> 00:38:36,359
I'm gonna go see if Serena needs anything.

721
00:38:43,053 --> 00:38:46,580
Yeah, I'm up at brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca

722
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,532
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be 'hood forever

723
00:38:49,532 --> 00:38:50,854
I'm the new Sinatra

724
00:38:50,854 --> 00:38:53,496
And since I made it here, I can make it anywhere

725
00:38:53,817 --> 00:38:54,993
Yeah, they love me everywhere

726
00:39:02,538 --> 00:39:03,620
Rufus?

727
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,769
Sinatra sings,

728
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:07,141
"New York, New York, it's a helluva town."

729
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,912
But on the upper east side,

730
00:39:08,912 --> 00:39:11,836
Sometimes it just feels like hell.

731
00:39:11,836 --> 00:39:15,155
New york

732
00:39:15,547 --> 00:39:19,262
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of

733
00:39:19,778 --> 00:39:22,080
I think I might need some advice.

734
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,282
Even when we're sure we've earned that happy ending...

735
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:29,564
It doesn't always come.

736
00:39:32,642 --> 00:39:34,151
Second thoughts creep in.

737
00:39:37,355 --> 00:39:39,824
Secret missions sneak out.

738
00:39:45,118 --> 00:39:48,591
And only sleeping beauty finds her prince.

739
00:39:53,987 --> 00:39:55,284
Hey, you're late.

740
00:39:55,284 --> 00:39:56,929
These guys are texting. They're waiting.

741
00:39:56,929 --> 00:39:58,610
Sorry. It was a hectic night.

742
00:39:58,992 --> 00:40:00,158
Do you even have it on you?

743
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,764
Well, can I hold it?

744
00:40:03,781 --> 00:40:06,003
The queen bee likes a thrill, yeah?

745
00:40:06,388 --> 00:40:09,076
And, uh, this time, I want to go to the table alone.

746
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,696
By the way, those handbags totally saved my ass,

747
00:40:12,696 --> 00:40:14,799
So, uh, thanks for making that happen.

748
00:40:14,799 --> 00:40:16,566
Don't thank me. You earned that money.

749
00:40:16,566 --> 00:40:18,150
And I needed it.

750
00:40:18,447 --> 00:40:20,986
It's not easy being queen. Or cheap.

751
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:22,280
Stick with me, Jenny Humphrey,

752
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,648
And you'll have enough cash to underwrite your entire kingdom.

753
00:40:27,617 --> 00:40:30,372
In this city, nothing is for certain.

754
00:40:30,897 --> 00:40:35,004
The night can push you forward into a dark future

755
00:40:35,885 --> 00:40:40,083
Or plunge you into a mysterious past.

756
00:40:56,466 --> 00:40:57,532
Lily?

757
00:41:02,023 --> 00:41:03,388
Charles.
