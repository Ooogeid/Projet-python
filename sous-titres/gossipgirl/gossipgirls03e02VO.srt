00:00:00,101 --> 00:00:02,524
<i> Gossip girl Here,
Your one and only source</i>

2
00:00:02,574 --> 00:00:05,260
<i>Into the scandalous lives
of manhattan's elite.</i>

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,619
You got into brown. The letter came while
you were away. Congratulations.

4
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:10,686
You said you could
call in a favor at n.Y.U.

5
00:00:10,736 --> 00:00:12,692
Did you mean it ?
- I can only get you an interview.

6
00:00:12,742 --> 00:00:14,349
It's gonna be up to you to wow him.

7
00:00:14,399 --> 00:00:15,990
You got your money.
That's all that matters.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,043
- Now you can go to Yale.
- Well I'm going to NYU now.

9
00:00:19,093 --> 00:00:20,760
Great. Then i'll see you
next year.

10
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,052
<i>Oh, my god.
You're nate archibald.</i>

11
00:00:22,102 --> 00:00:24,251
and you're bree buckley.
It's good to see you again.

12
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:26,436
I made some new friends,
one in particular.

13
00:00:26,486 --> 00:00:27,998
Oh. So you are dating someone ?

14
00:00:28,048 --> 00:00:30,884
His name's scott, and i think you guys
Would really like each other.

15
00:00:30,934 --> 00:00:32,062
Yeah, mom,
everything's great.

16
00:00:32,285 --> 00:00:34,500
I have been waiting all summer
for reed to start,

17
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,526
<i>And tomorrow's the day
i get to do what i came here for.</i>

18
00:00:36,576 --> 00:00:38,647
I know secrecy
is a lot to ask for,

19
00:00:38,697 --> 00:00:41,945
But i really can't risk making my family
more upset right now. Don't worry.

20
00:00:41,995 --> 00:00:43,844
I'm good
at secret relationships.

21
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:46,750
What if your dad didn't want
to see you ? Who cares ?

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,402
Who the hell is he
not to want you ?

23
00:00:48,452 --> 00:00:50,510
I would've stayed all summer
with you.

24
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,330
Vanessa, i'm--I'm not changing.

25
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,992
I don't care if you're rich,
which you aren't, by the way.

26
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:57,355
If you're gonna be in this world
be yourself in this world.

27
00:00:57,405 --> 00:00:59,674
- Is there anything else ?
- I'd like to request a roommate--

28
00:00:59,724 --> 00:01:00,848
Blair waldorf.

29
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:03,996
She's my best friend, and i just
can't wait to live with her.

Gossip Girl Saison 3 Épisode 02
** The Freshman **

36
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,649
<i>Every fall,
confident high school seniors</i>

37
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:30,362
<i>Transform into
nervous college freshmen.</i>

38
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:32,549
<i>They leave their parents' homes</i>

39
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:35,129
<i>For the hallowed halls
of higher education.</i>

40
00:01:35,449 --> 00:01:37,140
<i>And like any new venture,</i>

41
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,077
<i>Starting college
holds the promise</i>

42
00:01:39,127 --> 00:01:40,868
<i>Of limitless opportunity.</i>

43
00:01:40,918 --> 00:01:43,427
<i>The opportunity
to conquer a new territory...</i>

44
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,821
<i>Or to try and be
a little less lonely...</i>

45
00:02:02,628 --> 00:02:04,495
<i>But just because
the opportunity</i>

46
00:02:04,545 --> 00:02:05,774
<i>Presents itself...</i>

47
00:02:05,824 --> 00:02:08,892
<i>Have a safe drive up to Brown.
So proud of you ! XO Mom</i>

48
00:02:10,876 --> 00:02:13,400
<i>doesn't mean
everybody is ready to take it.</i>

49
00:02:17,442 --> 00:02:18,252
Mmm.

50
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:22,385
You're so sweet
to see me off.

51
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:25,109
I can't believe n.Y.U. Orientation week
Is finally here.

52
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:27,152
I have to object
to you living in the dorms.

53
00:02:27,202 --> 00:02:29,814
Fluorescent lighting,
communal showers,

54
00:02:29,864 --> 00:02:31,305
Public school girls ?

55
00:02:31,575 --> 00:02:32,620
There's a place for that,

56
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,700
And it belongs
in the back of a video store.

57
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,038
It's not for long.

58
00:02:36,216 --> 00:02:38,705
I can't rule the n.Y.U. Masses
from the upper east side.

59
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:41,318
I need to spend time in the dorm
to establish myself as queen.

60
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:42,950
It's not constance, blair.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,370
The only queens at n.Y.U.

62
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,365
Are the ones with tickets
to see liza at carnegie hall.

63
00:02:47,724 --> 00:02:50,483
Chuck, i trust
that when you say,

64
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:52,277
"Never drink absinthe
with daniel baldwin",

65
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:53,721
You know what
you're talking about.

66
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:57,173
But when i say the first week
of college means

67
00:02:57,223 --> 00:03:00,120
Scared, vulnerable freshmen
needing someone to guide them,

68
00:03:00,273 --> 00:03:01,517
That i know what
i'm talking about

69
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,313
And i'm very excited
for you.

70
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:08,758
So you haven't called vanessa yet ?

71
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:10,425
No, she's the one who's out of line.
She's gotta call me.

72
00:03:10,475 --> 00:03:12,479
Or you could just get over it.
After all these years,

73
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:14,482
You guys are finally gonna
be at the same school.

74
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:16,033
I guess you're right.
It's probably not the best idea

75
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,972
To be avoiding my only friend
at n.Y.U.

76
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:19,277
For the record, dan,
i don't think

77
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:21,324
You're gonna have any trouble
making friends there.

78
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:24,071
Right, because The world of
greenwich village intelligentsia

79
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,918
Is dan humphrey's
natural habitat.

80
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:29,852
You're so lucky. N.Y.U.
Is exactly the right place for you.

81
00:03:30,298 --> 00:03:31,757
Like brown is for you.

82
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:35,573
Serena ?

83
00:03:35,796 --> 00:03:36,618
Um...

84
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:38,943
Sorry. Uh, yeah.

85
00:03:38,993 --> 00:03:40,962
You know what ?
I should finish packing.

86
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:42,735
But good luck, dan.

87
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,459
Hey, i'm sorry.

88
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:46,939
Are you dan humphrey ?

89
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:49,463
Uh, yeah.
- Like the dan humphrey who was published

90
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:51,139
In the "20 under 20" issue
of "the new yorker ?"

91
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,418
Uh, yeah.

92
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:56,655
Large coffee, please.

93
00:03:57,078 --> 00:04:00,425
I'm katie, and i'm not usually
an eavesdropping stalker.

94
00:04:00,475 --> 00:04:03,760
It's just that i read
your piece, and it was amazing.

95
00:04:04,065 --> 00:04:06,534
What ? Really ? Wow.
That's--That--Thank you.

96
00:04:06,584 --> 00:04:09,783
Yeah, well, at first i hated you
because i also submitted,

97
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,957
But then i read it
and i was like,

98
00:04:12,156 --> 00:04:15,784
Okay, fine. I accept defeat
at your hands, dan humphrey.

99
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:18,549
Anyway, i have a writer's group.
We meet every week.

100
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:21,720
We're meeting here at noon
tomorrow. You should come.

101
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,137
car's downstairs. You ready ?

102
00:04:26,187 --> 00:04:28,673
As i'll ever be.
- Today's a big day,

103
00:04:28,838 --> 00:04:30,869
You and dan
both off college.

104
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:32,951
Yeah, i know. I know.

105
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:35,088
Uh, i should get going.

106
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:37,838
Your mom's so proud of you.

107
00:04:39,506 --> 00:04:40,492
So am i.

108
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:10,907
Hey.

109
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:13,783
Uh, scott, you remember dan.
Dan, this is scott.

110
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,548
Yeah. No, it's, uh, it's good
to finally officially meet you.

111
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:18,655
Uh, so are you two dating now ?
Last i heard you were just friends.

112
00:05:18,705 --> 00:05:20,877
Yeah, you actually have to call me
To find out what's going on in my life.

113
00:05:20,927 --> 00:05:23,748
Oh, well, okay.
I didn't realize we were speaking.

114
00:05:24,577 --> 00:05:27,183
<i>- oh, god.
- of course she's in a limo.</i>

115
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:28,146
Ew.

116
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:31,375
Let's make it clear
from the start.

117
00:05:31,657 --> 00:05:33,454
We don't know each other here.

118
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:37,251
- Works for me.
- Me, too.

119
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:46,693
Well, hello, sis.

120
00:05:46,998 --> 00:05:49,851
I assume you need a few ounces
of study aid for brown.

121
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:52,659
No. I need a place to stay.

122
00:05:53,974 --> 00:05:55,524
I'm not going to brown.

123
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:09,395
<i>yes, we may all be freshmen and
new to n.Y.U. And the dorms,</i>

124
00:06:09,445 --> 00:06:11,656
<i> but that doesn't mean
We have to embarrass ourselves.</i>

125
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:15,320
<i>I can tell from looking around this room
that none of you are From new york city.</i>

126
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,256
Actually, i'm from--
Riverdale doesn't count.

127
00:06:17,306 --> 00:06:18,679
Anyway, i won't be holding

128
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:20,599
The sad truths of your hometowns
against you.

129
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:24,233
In fact, i want to help you.
For example, who can tell me

130
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:27,069
Which is the only club to be
seen at on a saturday night ?

131
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:28,117
I read marquee.

132
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:31,222
Wrong. You should never be seen
at a club on a saturday night.

133
00:06:31,272 --> 00:06:33,182
It's strictly bridge and tunnel
on the weekends.

134
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:36,350
You're welcome. Now dorota and i
have put together some gift bags

135
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,382
Filled with essentials
for everyone.

136
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:41,294
I think you don't need week
to run school.

137
00:06:41,344 --> 00:06:42,600
You do it in one day.

138
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,233
I know. This is going
even better than i'd hoped.

139
00:06:45,283 --> 00:06:47,341
And the best part is
i seem to have a single.

140
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:48,656
Sorry i'm late.

141
00:06:50,475 --> 00:06:51,344
Blair ?

142
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:53,583
Blair waldorf ? Oh, my gosh !

143
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:58,274
Oh, my gosh. I can't believe it !
We're roommates !

144
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:00,575
<i>Rah rah, sis boom bah.</i>

145
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,724
<i>Georgina's pulled
a coup d'Ã©tat.</i>

146
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:04,618
<i>Welcome to college, b.</i>

147
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:06,626
<i>This is gonna be a blast.</i>

148
00:07:07,436 --> 00:07:09,761
Following me to n.Y.U ?.
Becoming my roommate ?

149
00:07:09,811 --> 00:07:11,946
I'm gonna have dorota file
a restraining order.

150
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,153
I mean,
you're overreacting.

151
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:16,208
The roommate thing is
just a coincidence.

152
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:18,846
Besides, my parents said it was
either bible camp or college,

153
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,897
So go, bobcats !
- So you're not in love with jesus anymore ?

154
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:23,482
Oh, i still hold him
in my heart,

155
00:07:23,532 --> 00:07:25,665
But jesus and i have
redefined our relationship.

156
00:07:25,715 --> 00:07:27,872
You mean he dumped you because
he found out you were satan !

157
00:07:27,922 --> 00:07:29,980
This could actually
be a good thing, blair.

158
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,652
Look. Manolos.
Size 7, just like you.

159
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:35,507
Let me know if you want to borrow.

160
00:07:36,258 --> 00:07:37,010
I'll win, you know.

161
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,881
I ruled at constance and i will
rule here, And you can't stand in my way.

162
00:07:39,931 --> 00:07:41,830
Are you still playing
this tired old game ?

163
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,548
<i>Oh, please. Like you're not ?
No, i'm not. I'm actually here for a fresh start.</i>

164
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:46,440
Oh, no.

165
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,317
Vanessa, you're in our dorm, too ?
Yay !

166
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,951
Your dorm ? Yeah, um,
my room's just down the hall.

167
00:07:53,115 --> 00:07:54,066
So, uh...

168
00:07:54,522 --> 00:07:55,732
That's awesome.

169
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:00,984
<i>Oh !</i>

170
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,837
Isn't this so pretty ?

171
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:06,649
I'm gonna hang it up.

172
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:23,931
Oh, miss blair.

173
00:08:24,726 --> 00:08:27,015
What are we going to do ?
Call police ?

174
00:08:27,065 --> 00:08:27,872
No.

175
00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:29,784
We're going to throw a party.

176
00:08:29,937 --> 00:08:32,555
I go to masa,
see if they will cater.

177
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,739
Pardon me.

178
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:43,584
I was packing and talking
to blair about her classes,

179
00:08:43,634 --> 00:08:45,448
And then it hit me.

180
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:47,701
I wasn't excited
about any of it.

181
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:49,614
I don't know
what i want to do yet,

182
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:53,305
And--And going off to
a new place to figure that out ?

183
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,347
I don't know. I'm just--
I'm not ready for that.

184
00:08:56,397 --> 00:08:58,512
Look, sis,
for people like us,

185
00:08:58,562 --> 00:09:00,806
A college degree is
just an accessory,

186
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,069
Like a malawi baby
or a poodle.

187
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:05,793
Well, it's an accessory my
mother really wants me to have.

188
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:08,620
So you want to hide out at the
bass cave Until you figure it out.

189
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,380
Yeah, if it's okay with you.
Nobody knows about this,

190
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,579
Not even blair. Blair would be
even more upset than my mother.

191
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:16,669
I couldn't help but notice
you and carter baizen

192
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:18,348
At the van der bilt
polo party.

193
00:09:18,501 --> 00:09:20,216
This doesn't have anything to do
with him, does it ?

194
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:22,999
No, absolutely not. I haven't
even seen him since then.

195
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:24,478
Good. Just one favor--

196
00:09:24,654 --> 00:09:27,391
I'm having a meeting here tonight,
So if you can clear out for a few hours.

197
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,331
Chuck, i don't mind
if your dealer comes by.

198
00:09:29,381 --> 00:09:31,844
Jesse is in st. Barths
this week.

199
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:34,312
This is something
more legitimate.

200
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,245
You know
the old art deco bank

201
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,440
On 72nd between madison
and park ?

202
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,068
The one that went
under last month ?

203
00:09:51,118 --> 00:09:53,208
I want to make it
into a speakeasy.

204
00:09:56,616 --> 00:09:58,658
In the front--
An elegant restaurant,

205
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,384
But down in the vault--

206
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:02,680
An after-Hours locale

207
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,838
Devoted to indecency,

208
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:08,199
Disreputable behavior
and all manner of debauchery.

209
00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:11,422
A kind of homage to the last
time the market crashed.

210
00:10:11,472 --> 00:10:12,291
The harder the times,

211
00:10:12,341 --> 00:10:14,757
The harder people want to party
and forget about it.

212
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:18,927
Chuck.
this is really a great idea.

213
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,706
I-I can't believe blair
hasn't told me about this yet.

214
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:24,218
She doesn't know.
Nobody does.

215
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:27,600
I just wanted to wait till i was
sure it was going through.

216
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:29,689
You know, my father
turned his first profit

217
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:31,321
By the time he was 22.

218
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:33,630
I hope to do it
by the time i'm 21.

219
00:10:43,455 --> 00:10:44,711
Let me guess.

220
00:10:44,864 --> 00:10:46,925
women in literature,
professor schweik ?

221
00:10:46,975 --> 00:10:49,296
You know i'm a sucker for
stories about scorned women.

222
00:10:49,346 --> 00:10:53,186
I got the same. I think the universe
is trying to tell us something.

223
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:56,497
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I should have called you.

224
00:10:56,547 --> 00:10:57,822
No, it's--It's okay.

225
00:10:57,872 --> 00:10:59,357
I wouldn't have wanted
to call me either

226
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:01,379
After the way i came down on you
at the party.

227
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:04,773
Um... so... scott ?

228
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:06,977
Yeah, he's--He's so great,

229
00:11:07,027 --> 00:11:08,679
And he really wants
to get to know you.

230
00:11:08,729 --> 00:11:10,417
Oh, my god. I have so much to tell you.

231
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:11,990
You are never gonna guess
who lives in my dorm.

232
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,468
- Hey, guys.
- Oh. Oh !

233
00:11:14,621 --> 00:11:17,322
Sorry to interrupt. I just
saw you, and i thought, um...

234
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,474
So i really just want
to apologize

235
00:11:20,524 --> 00:11:22,312
For everything
that happened in the past.

236
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:25,975
I've got my meds straightened out,
And i'm really in a much better place now.

237
00:11:26,739 --> 00:11:29,290
So i come to n.Y.U.
Hoping for a fresh start,

238
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,269
And who do i get as my roommate ?
Blair waldorf.

239
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:31,912
What ?

240
00:11:31,962 --> 00:11:33,779
i told you we have
so much to catch up on.

241
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:37,837
I mean, i wish i had some
other friends here, you know ?

242
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,426
You guys are--Are really
lucky to have each other.

243
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:47,072
Anyway, i should go.

244
00:11:50,718 --> 00:11:52,127
Okay,
this is probably too much,

245
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:54,842
But would you guys want to have
a cup of coffee with me ?

246
00:11:55,752 --> 00:11:56,947
Uh...

247
00:11:56,997 --> 00:11:58,171
Look, georgina,

248
00:11:58,758 --> 00:12:00,461
I appreciate that you want
a clean slate,

249
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:04,530
But i think it would
kind of be too much. I'm sorry.

250
00:12:05,352 --> 00:12:06,221
No, of course.

251
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,755
I-I mean,
i-I totally understand.

252
00:12:07,805 --> 00:12:10,136
I'd feel the same way.
I'll see you around.

253
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:16,546
Maybe we were
a little bit too harsh.

254
00:12:16,596 --> 00:12:19,020
- What ? It's--It's georgina.
- And you're dan.

255
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,753
And you're vanessa.
This is a fun game.

256
00:12:20,803 --> 00:12:22,202
I'm sorry. I just thought you were

257
00:12:22,252 --> 00:12:23,646
A little bit more forgiving
than that.

258
00:12:23,696 --> 00:12:25,642
Are you--Are you really trying
to make me the bad guy here ?

259
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:29,511
No, it's just we want a fresh
start and--And so does she.

260
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:32,576
Okay. I know you're new
to the whole school thing,

261
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,648
But you don't want georgina
as your friend.

262
00:12:34,698 --> 00:12:36,979
I mean, she's gonna scare
everyone away.

263
00:12:39,996 --> 00:12:41,793
- Georgina.
- Hey.

264
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:46,411
What's gonna happen next week
when we start classes ?

265
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:48,837
That's why we have
my family's apartment.

266
00:12:48,982 --> 00:12:51,257
And plus, you know,
all this sneaking around,

267
00:12:51,307 --> 00:12:52,807
Making sure the doorman
doesn't see you,

268
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:55,108
Not answering the phone
when my mother calls--

269
00:12:55,254 --> 00:12:57,308
I mean, you know it adds
a layer of hotness.

270
00:12:58,271 --> 00:12:59,445
What are you saying ?

271
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:01,124
That our hotness is
only purely circumstantial

272
00:13:01,174 --> 00:13:03,095
And that if we were
out in the real world,

273
00:13:03,247 --> 00:13:04,879
We'd like each other less ?

274
00:13:05,913 --> 00:13:07,979
Mm. You know that
if we really started dating,

275
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:09,368
After a few months,

276
00:13:09,896 --> 00:13:12,397
You'd realize that you hate
the way that i laugh,

277
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:14,435
I couldn't stand
the way that you chew,

278
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:16,454
And then we'd break up.

279
00:13:17,652 --> 00:13:20,439
That's a very romantic story,
you know,

280
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:23,492
But... it doesn't have
to be like that.

281
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:28,187
Care to make a bet ?
I got an idea.

282
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:32,543
I will hole up with you
for the next 24 hours,

283
00:13:32,593 --> 00:13:35,376
And we can fast-Forward through
the entire relationship.

284
00:13:35,426 --> 00:13:37,877
Leave the seat up,
sing timberlake in the shower.

285
00:13:37,927 --> 00:13:39,492
Ah, watch tv shows
you really like

286
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:40,983
As opposed to ones
you're supposed to like ?

287
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:45,703
What do you say--
You, me, this apartment ?

288
00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:48,146
Let's get sick
of each other.

289
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:50,834
Okay.

290
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:55,394
As you can see, the restaurant
would be elegant--

291
00:13:55,444 --> 00:13:57,566
Seasonal menu,
extensive wine list.

292
00:13:58,012 --> 00:14:01,778
You know, the space is big, But i want
it to have a more intimate feel.

293
00:14:02,154 --> 00:14:04,584
And how would you be using
the vault space ?

294
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:07,617
It's perfect for storage.

295
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:09,172
I have to be honest.

296
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,412
Give your reputation,
when you made your bid,

297
00:14:12,462 --> 00:14:14,558
The board was
very concerned.

298
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:16,216
I completely understand.

299
00:14:16,798 --> 00:14:19,389
The neighbors don't want
some raucous club coming in

300
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:21,247
And disrupting the quiet.
And believe me,

301
00:14:21,297 --> 00:14:23,567
I wouldn't want to bring
that element to the area.

302
00:14:24,018 --> 00:14:25,448
I'll be right down.

303
00:14:28,148 --> 00:14:29,914
Sorry. I'm not here.

304
00:14:29,964 --> 00:14:31,328
my heel broke.

305
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:33,923
Stepsister. I apologize.

306
00:14:34,686 --> 00:14:36,364
My lawyer. Excuse me.

307
00:14:40,204 --> 00:14:41,876
Sorry for interrupting
your meeting.

308
00:14:41,926 --> 00:14:43,962
Not at all. We were
just finishing up anyway.

309
00:14:44,012 --> 00:14:46,599
Oh, are you--Are you leasing
chuck the bank space ?

310
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:49,755
Mm-Hmm.
He has a real vision.

311
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:53,064
I know. Turning the vault
into a club--It's genius.

312
00:14:53,114 --> 00:14:54,097
<i>Serena.</i>

313
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:56,422
excuse me ?

314
00:15:15,266 --> 00:15:16,211
Thank you.

315
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:23,923
Cool party. I'm amalia.

316
00:15:28,097 --> 00:15:30,945
I'm glad people understand The concept
of being fashionably late,

317
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:32,978
- But this is ridiculous.
- I think everybody's

318
00:15:33,028 --> 00:15:35,306
Down the hall,
watching a movie or something.

319
00:15:36,128 --> 00:15:36,938
What ?

320
00:15:37,883 --> 00:15:38,717
Please.

321
00:15:39,316 --> 00:15:40,701
Ease up on the toro.

322
00:15:42,387 --> 00:15:44,826
He has to answer to a board,
serena.

323
00:15:45,048 --> 00:15:47,241
And board members tend
not to approve

324
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:51,194
Of clubs with coat check girls
who give happy endings.

325
00:15:51,244 --> 00:15:53,002
It was an honest mistake.

326
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,448
When he was talking about
your plans--

327
00:15:54,515 --> 00:15:57,152
why do you think
i asked you to go out tonight ?

328
00:15:58,033 --> 00:16:00,686
Because i knew something
like this would happen.

329
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:03,703
Fine. Then i'll go.

330
00:16:05,687 --> 00:16:06,814
Train wreck.

331
00:16:14,111 --> 00:16:15,919
<i>great job, vanessa.</i>

332
00:16:15,969 --> 00:16:17,222
<i>That was awesome.</i>

333
00:16:20,597 --> 00:16:22,425
Oh. Hey, blair.

334
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:25,822
Oh, my god. We just finished
watching vanessa's documentary

335
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:28,315
About this community garden
in her neighborhood.

336
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:31,107
It was amazing.
- No, it wasn't.

337
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:35,096
Yes, it was. I-I mean, vanessa,
tears. Actual tears.

338
00:16:35,146 --> 00:16:37,457
When that gang member picked up
his first carrot--

339
00:16:37,507 --> 00:16:39,559
Okay, screening is over.

340
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:41,426
The cocktail party has
officially begun

341
00:16:41,476 --> 00:16:43,405
In the common room.
Sake-Tinis.

342
00:16:43,455 --> 00:16:47,034
And is that my invitation
being used as a coaster ?

343
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:49,883
Um, thanks so much, blair,

344
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:52,281
But we actually just scarfed,
like, four pizzas,

345
00:16:52,331 --> 00:16:53,889
And vanessa's about to show us

346
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:56,789
Her bootleg michel gondry videos.
- Georgina, please.

347
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:00,734
Nobody wants greasy pizza
and vanessa's home movies

348
00:17:00,784 --> 00:17:04,055
When there's a sushi and sake
party right in the other room.

349
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:06,838
Did i mention wasabi facials ?

350
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:12,223
Okay, then.

351
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:14,149
And shut the door ?

352
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:19,999
<i>Spotted--Blair waldorf
going from v.I.P. To v.D.</i>

353
00:17:20,293 --> 00:17:23,357
<i>Poor blair. How are you
going to cure this one ?</i>

354
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:28,054
morning.

355
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,917
Hey.

356
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,125
Thanks for letting me
crash here last night.

357
00:17:34,175 --> 00:17:37,113
Harboring an ivy league fugitive ?
I'm your man.

358
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:38,954
I made you breakfast.

359
00:17:39,004 --> 00:17:41,456
I have to go, but remember,
we don't have any servants here,

360
00:17:41,506 --> 00:17:43,593
So if you see anybody else
in the loft besides me,

361
00:17:43,643 --> 00:17:45,149
Call the police.
It's not the chef.

362
00:17:45,384 --> 00:17:46,640
Good to know.

363
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:50,409
So did classes
start already ?

364
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:51,971
Uh, no,
just orientation stuff.

365
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:53,938
But, uh, i did join
a literary group.

366
00:17:53,988 --> 00:17:56,368
More people have talked to me
at n.Y.U. In one day

367
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:59,374
Than my entire four years at st. Jude's.
Well, i'm not surprised.

368
00:17:59,424 --> 00:18:02,032
I can totally see why people
would love you there.

369
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:05,343
Oh, about brown Uh, you really
should think about talking to my dad.

370
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:07,988
He might ramble a lot, he might
nervously strum his guitar,

371
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:10,799
But, uh, when it comes
to fatherly advice,

372
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:13,464
I don't know, he's pretty much
the best there is.

373
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,070
do you want one ?
Thanks.

374
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,158
Come to the party.
Come to the party. Thanks.

375
00:18:28,952 --> 00:18:30,655
It's gonna be really fun.
- we'll be there.

376
00:18:30,705 --> 00:18:31,923
Oh, fantastic.

377
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:34,144
Oh.

378
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:37,247
So if you're not trying to
sabotage me, then what is this ?

379
00:18:37,297 --> 00:18:39,032
First you deliberately ruin
my sushi party,

380
00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:41,826
And now you're making your move.
- This paranoia has got to stop, blair.

381
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:43,859
I am not paranoid.
I'm right.

382
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:45,694
Why else would you have formed
an alliance with vanessa,

383
00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:47,146
The one person i may hate
more than you ?

384
00:18:47,196 --> 00:18:49,038
It's not an alliance.
It's a friendship.

385
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:51,386
Unlike you, vanessa's cool
and people like her,

386
00:18:51,436 --> 00:18:54,140
More than the weird girl
who threw the fish party.

387
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:56,171
Sushi. There was toro.

388
00:18:57,639 --> 00:18:58,672
Face it, blair.

389
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,646
Once upon a time,
in a far-Off land,

390
00:19:01,696 --> 00:19:03,125
You were a queen.

391
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,967
Here you're just a loser
who will never fit in.

392
00:19:06,988 --> 00:19:08,808
So you won't be
needing that.

393
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,861
<i>Hey, guys. Do you want
to come to my party ?</i>

394
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:16,222
<i>You can have one, too.
You're really pretty.</i>

395
00:19:16,374 --> 00:19:17,279
<i>thank you.</i>

396
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,486
Rufus ?

397
00:19:27,245 --> 00:19:28,361
Hello ?

398
00:19:31,646 --> 00:19:32,597
What are you doing here ?

399
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:34,522
Rufus and i were
just catching up.

400
00:19:34,688 --> 00:19:36,895
But i have to prepare
for a meeting tonight.

401
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:38,592
Thank you for the waffles.

402
00:19:45,073 --> 00:19:46,048
Look, i...

403
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,775
I don't know what kind of
twisted spin Chuck put on things,

404
00:19:49,825 --> 00:19:52,538
But i actually wanted
to talk to you about this.

405
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:55,079
Rufus, i'm having doubts
about going to brown.

406
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:56,361
Well, i'm sorry about that,

407
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:58,063
But to lie about leaving
for college ?

408
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,764
I mean, between the show you put
on for the paparazzi all summer

409
00:20:00,814 --> 00:20:03,294
And the craziness at the polo
party last week and this,

410
00:20:03,344 --> 00:20:04,507
I don't know
what's going on with you.

411
00:20:04,557 --> 00:20:07,511
I know. I'm sorry i lied. I just
didn't want to upset my mom.

412
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:09,061
at least we agree
about that,

413
00:20:09,111 --> 00:20:11,538
Which is why you can repack your
things and go to brown today.

414
00:20:11,588 --> 00:20:13,106
I'll have a car here
within an hour.

415
00:20:13,156 --> 00:20:15,676
As long as you're in it, there's no
reason Lily ever has to know about this.

416
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:17,463
Or what, you'll tell on me ?

417
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:20,188
Wow. I feel really
emotionally supported

418
00:20:20,238 --> 00:20:23,722
In making this life-Changing decision.
- It's not a decision. It's a mistake,

419
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:26,566
Which is why i'm--I'm trying
to get you not to make it.

420
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:28,096
By threatening me.

421
00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:34,146
do you know you're more
afraid of my mother than i am ?

422
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:39,638
You know what, rufus ?
Go ahead. Call her.

423
00:20:40,143 --> 00:20:42,374
You can let her know
i'm not going to brown.

424
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:45,264
Thanks for the talk.

425
00:20:58,075 --> 00:20:59,026
What do you want ?

426
00:20:59,076 --> 00:21:02,408
Hey. I was wondering
if you want to go out tonight.

427
00:21:02,807 --> 00:21:04,822
- I thought you were at brown.
- No, i'm not.

428
00:21:04,975 --> 00:21:06,592
In fact,
after i hang up with you,

429
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:08,729
I will be withdrawing
my admission.

430
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,442
There's nobody
i'd rather celebrate with.

431
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,951
So are you in or out ?

432
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:17,567
See you tonight.

433
00:21:21,962 --> 00:21:23,172
<i>no, i'm telling you,</i>

434
00:21:23,222 --> 00:21:26,539
<i>I learned everything i need to know
about women From judy blume's "forever".

435
00:21:35,175 --> 00:21:36,408
Can i talk to you ?

436
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,911
Uh, yeah. Yeah. What's up ?

437
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:42,102
I was wondering...

438
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:45,613
Do you have a date
to georgina's party ?

439
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:47,659
<i>Forget the four horsemen.</i>

440
00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:50,488
<i>The real evidence our world
is coming to an end--</i>

441
00:21:50,735 --> 00:21:53,154
<i>Blair waldorf needing
dan humphrey</i>

442
00:21:53,204 --> 00:21:55,567
<i>To rescue her
from social extinction.</i>

443
00:22:12,518 --> 00:22:13,510
You okay ?

444
00:22:16,011 --> 00:22:18,590
I just feel like i got off
on the wrong foot here,

445
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,826
And i want to start again.

446
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:23,384
So... thanks for bringing me,
humphrey.

447
00:22:23,983 --> 00:22:26,780
Oh. Uh, yeah. Well, you know,
i-I would just like to think

448
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,223
That if i needed it, somebody
would do the same for me.

449
00:22:29,273 --> 00:22:31,771
Although, let's be honest,
we both know it wouldn't be you.

450
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:33,687
Oh.

451
00:22:33,737 --> 00:22:36,940
No headbands in college,
okay ?

452
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,933
- Katie.
- Hey, guys.

453
00:22:56,426 --> 00:22:58,492
Blair, you, uh,
you remember katie ?

454
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,242
Yeah. Cute necklace.

455
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:02,432
Thank you. I love your...

456
00:23:05,602 --> 00:23:08,176
How--How about i get us all
drinks and you two talk ?

457
00:23:08,226 --> 00:23:10,196
Just not about high school,
please.

458
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:11,781
What's up, dan ?

459
00:23:12,662 --> 00:23:14,153
So was everyone
at your high school

460
00:23:14,203 --> 00:23:17,030
Totally jealous of dan for
being such a great writer ?

461
00:23:17,793 --> 00:23:19,052
Dan's a writer ?

462
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,781
Oh. Hey, dan.

463
00:23:27,251 --> 00:23:29,646
Hey. Um, listen.
I'm sorry about yesterday.

464
00:23:29,696 --> 00:23:30,644
I-I was out of line.

465
00:23:30,694 --> 00:23:34,591
Please don't Don't even worry about it.
I mean, you have every right to be upset.

466
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,432
I'm just really glad you're here.
- Thanks.

467
00:23:37,861 --> 00:23:40,385
Okay, so am i really drunk,

468
00:23:40,435 --> 00:23:42,572
Or did i just see you
walk in with blair ?

469
00:23:44,794 --> 00:23:46,720
look, you wanted me
to give you a second chance.

470
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,904
Don't you think you should
give one to blair ?

471
00:23:48,954 --> 00:23:50,970
She's not looking
for a second chance.

472
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,720
She's looking for a way in.

473
00:23:52,896 --> 00:23:55,517
People like you here, dan,
and blair sees that.

474
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,122
I'm sorry. I've been the person
not welcome at parties,

475
00:23:59,172 --> 00:24:01,189
And if i'm now
on the other side of things,

476
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,907
I'm--I'm not gonna treat people
the way i was treated,

477
00:24:03,957 --> 00:24:06,960
Even if it's blair.
I'm just trying to look out for you.

478
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:09,391
Trust me.
You're being used.

479
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:12,626
Have fun.

480
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:28,570
Gross !

481
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,047
With your mother's
l.L. Bean catalog ?

482
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,454
Ugh. A cargo short fetish

483
00:24:33,504 --> 00:24:35,066
Definitely goes
in the "minus" column.

484
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:36,848
What are you talking about ?
I was, like, 12 years old.

485
00:24:36,898 --> 00:24:39,528
Speaking of pants,
pass yours over here.

486
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:42,171
- What do you need my pants for ?
- Because i want to see what's in them.

487
00:24:42,221 --> 00:24:44,285
Come on. Show me
all your secrets.

488
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,317
- Have a look. It's just normal stuff.
- Normal stuff, huh ?

489
00:24:47,658 --> 00:24:48,738
All right.

490
00:24:49,032 --> 00:24:50,581
- See ?
- hmm ?

491
00:24:50,631 --> 00:24:52,413
Keys, cell phone.

492
00:24:53,387 --> 00:24:54,695
A boarding pass...

493
00:24:55,837 --> 00:24:57,066
From london.

494
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:02,962
don't tell me That you've been wearing
these pants since we met,

495
00:25:03,012 --> 00:25:04,979
Because that really would be gross.
- No, i...

496
00:25:06,147 --> 00:25:07,838
if you must know, i kept it.

497
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:12,912
Ah.

498
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:16,587
And he has
a sentimental streak.

499
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:26,405
Hey, i thought
your theory was that

500
00:25:26,455 --> 00:25:28,520
If we really got to know
each other, we'd break up.

501
00:25:34,025 --> 00:25:35,881
Maybe i'm revising
my theory.

502
00:25:40,921 --> 00:25:42,859
To you.
Brown's loss is my gain.

503
00:25:43,939 --> 00:25:44,925
Thank you.

504
00:25:48,476 --> 00:25:51,177
You know, when you called,
i tried not to answer.

505
00:25:53,255 --> 00:25:55,826
Great. Chuck bass.

506
00:25:55,978 --> 00:25:58,385
Let's get out of here.
- No. Come on.

507
00:25:58,435 --> 00:26:00,809
Since when do you run away
from chuck bass ?

508
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,811
It looks like he's having
a business meeting.

509
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,103
This could be fun.

510
00:26:10,144 --> 00:26:11,048
No way.

511
00:26:11,098 --> 00:26:13,902
Serena, carter,
this isn't a good time.

512
00:26:13,952 --> 00:26:15,886
Well, then let's make it one.

513
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,807
What's wrong, chuck ?

514
00:26:16,857 --> 00:26:19,186
Aren't you happy to see us ?
- You know, carter and i were

515
00:26:19,236 --> 00:26:20,818
Just sharing our favorite
chuck bass stories.

516
00:26:20,868 --> 00:26:22,939
There were so many we had to
break them into categories.

517
00:26:22,989 --> 00:26:24,965
What were we up to,
international affairs ?

518
00:26:25,015 --> 00:26:26,731
Oh, there was a time when, uh, chuck

519
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:28,328
And the italian ambassador's
son

520
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:31,948
Were asked to leave an amsterdam brothel.
Now that's an accomplishment.

521
00:26:31,998 --> 00:26:34,845
Simple misunderstanding.
None of us spoke any dutch.

522
00:26:38,177 --> 00:26:41,583
Oh ! My gosh. Is this--
Is this a business meeting ?

523
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,943
I'm--I'm sorry if you sense
any tension.

524
00:26:43,993 --> 00:26:45,753
Those two don't like each other
that much

525
00:26:45,803 --> 00:26:47,546
'Cause they share
the same taste in women.

526
00:26:47,596 --> 00:26:50,237
Sometimes they share the actual women.
- That's enough.

527
00:26:50,287 --> 00:26:52,187
So what's this business meeting
about, bass ?

528
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:54,248
Still trying to fill your
daddy's shoes ?

529
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:56,639
Yeah, chuck, come on.
Tell him your idea.

530
00:26:56,862 --> 00:26:59,859
- I'm opening a restaurant.
- Yeah, that's what he's telling people,

531
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:03,809
But downstairs, in the vault,
he's creating a club.

532
00:27:03,962 --> 00:27:06,815
What did you say ? You wanted
to redefine decadence ?

533
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:11,874
You wanted to ruin my deal,

534
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:15,303
So you came here and brought
carter baizen as your wingman.

535
00:27:22,924 --> 00:27:24,885
I told rufus about brown

536
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:27,597
Because i was
actually concerned for you.

537
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,976
I'm sorry to have wasted
your time.

538
00:27:38,094 --> 00:27:41,135
<i>Are you insane ? "Battlestar"
kicks "t.N.G.'S" ass.</i>

539
00:27:41,546 --> 00:27:43,049
What other show on the history
of the planet

540
00:27:43,213 --> 00:27:44,669
Has been asked to speak
at the u.N. ?

541
00:27:44,719 --> 00:27:47,299
Oh, perfect. An organization
that condemns terrorism

542
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:50,781
While secretly funding it Hosts a panel
for a show that glorifies terrorists.

543
00:27:50,951 --> 00:27:53,733
Dude, i can't even look at you right now.
- Fine. Don't look.

544
00:27:54,456 --> 00:27:55,806
What do you think ?

545
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:00,139
Trust me.
You don't want to know.

546
00:28:00,189 --> 00:28:01,713
I do. I do want to know.

547
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,453
Oh, thank god.

548
00:28:10,316 --> 00:28:12,597
Man, i'm really glad you
decided to come to the party.

549
00:28:12,749 --> 00:28:14,616
Oh, thanks, man. That's...

550
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:16,648
Vanessa cares
about you a lot,

551
00:28:16,698 --> 00:28:19,020
And i know that
she was hoping you'd come.

552
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:21,264
You know...
- yeah, yeah, i know.

553
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,389
there he is.

554
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,964
Oh, speak of the devil. Hey.
To, uh, to fresh starts.

555
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:29,535
I'm happy you're here,
humphrey.

556
00:28:29,688 --> 00:28:30,686
me, too.

557
00:28:31,696 --> 00:28:34,150
So, scott,
you are in big trouble.

558
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,625
I cannot believe you told
vanessa to take professor rifkin

559
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:38,961
For art in the world.
- Why ? I mean, i liked him.

560
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:42,918
Dude, he's totally old school,
not to mention just plain old.

561
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:43,752
i mean,

562
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:47,134
His lecture notes are literally
turning yellow with age.

563
00:28:47,486 --> 00:28:50,844
Please do tell. What other
professors are you recommending ?

564
00:28:50,894 --> 00:28:52,713
Yeah, let's hear it,
because katie's gonna have

565
00:28:52,763 --> 00:28:54,874
To weigh in from now on.
- I-I'm at a party.

566
00:28:54,924 --> 00:28:56,710
I really don't feel like
taking a test right now.

567
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,884
excuse me, everyone.

568
00:28:57,934 --> 00:29:00,781
Can you please stop
with that noise ?

569
00:29:00,831 --> 00:29:03,580
Hi, everyone.
- What the hell ?

570
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:05,667
most of you don't know me.

571
00:29:05,717 --> 00:29:08,461
My name is blair waldorf.
But a lot of you know

572
00:29:08,511 --> 00:29:11,244
My roommate, who threw
this amazing party--Georgina.

573
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:15,454
georgina !

574
00:29:15,877 --> 00:29:18,202
Yeah, i know.
Georgina rocks, right ?

575
00:29:18,941 --> 00:29:20,726
I mean, it's funny,
'cause i never knew

576
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:23,444
That a jesus freak
could throw such a good party,

577
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:26,932
But i guess i was wrong.
So, everyone, raise a glass

578
00:29:26,982 --> 00:29:29,656
Or a... plastic cup of foam

579
00:29:29,808 --> 00:29:33,096
To the coolest christian
i know--Georgina sparks.

580
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,863
Oh... my god.

581
00:29:50,913 --> 00:29:52,636
This is a conversion party.

582
00:29:52,686 --> 00:29:55,630
I can't believe it.
Georgina threw this party

583
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,181
And invited all her friends here
To convert the vulnerable freshmen.

584
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:03,673
<i>It seems that blair waldorf
has finally found jesus</i>

585
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:07,406
<i>And invited him
to crash georgina's party.</i>

586
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:15,483
- Carter, wait.
- So that's the whole reason

587
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:19,627
You wanted me to go out with you tonight
You knew i'd help you screw over chuck.

588
00:30:19,677 --> 00:30:22,703
Chuck had screwed me over or--
Or at least i thought he had.

589
00:30:22,753 --> 00:30:23,815
I wanted to get him back.

590
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,597
Serena, listen to you.
What's your deal ?

591
00:30:25,647 --> 00:30:27,430
You're acting out
'cause daddy doesn't love you ?

592
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,409
Is that why you skipped out
on brown, too ?

593
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:30,339
Please.

594
00:30:31,191 --> 00:30:35,515
No. I told you how i felt,
and you blew me off

595
00:30:35,565 --> 00:30:37,464
Until you needed someone
to do your dirty work.

596
00:30:37,816 --> 00:30:40,074
It's time to find
a new bad habit,

597
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:43,472
'Cause it's not gonna be me
anymore.

598
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:48,873
V.I.P. V.I.P. Room
at the monkey bar.

599
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:51,210
Monkey bar. Can't wait.
The limo's waiting downstairs.

600
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,171
We were worried about you.
We missed you so much.

601
00:30:53,221 --> 00:30:55,396
I can't tell you
how my heart filled with joy

602
00:30:55,446 --> 00:30:58,191
When we got your call
inviting us to share his glory

603
00:30:58,241 --> 00:31:00,900
With all of your new friends.
I didn't invite you here.

604
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,827
We thought our little lamb
had been lost for good.

605
00:31:02,877 --> 00:31:04,048
I am lost for good.

606
00:31:04,098 --> 00:31:06,774
V.I.P. Room at the monkey bar.
Hope i see you there.

607
00:31:07,137 --> 00:31:09,976
Monkey bar. limo's downstairs.
- Wait. What the hell are you doing ?

608
00:31:10,026 --> 00:31:12,032
Georgina was turning everyone
against me.

609
00:31:12,082 --> 00:31:14,420
You were just a casualty in
the battle for social dominance.

610
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,815
But don't worry.
Your loyalty's been rewarded.

611
00:31:16,865 --> 00:31:18,999
Your name's on the list
at monkey bar. Yours isn't.

612
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:22,017
Georgina wasn't turning people
against you, blair.

613
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:24,119
You tried to bribe people
into being your friend

614
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:26,602
With sushi parties and gift
bags, and nobody liked it.

615
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:29,949
I don't need these losers to
like me in order to follow me.

616
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:31,405
Fear works better anyway.

617
00:31:31,455 --> 00:31:34,229
Dan, you've experienced
social siberia.

618
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:37,540
If you want to try something
new, i'll see you at monkey bar.

619
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,074
I didn't know there was
a cool crowd at college.

620
00:31:43,124 --> 00:31:44,882
Uh, i think you and i were
the only ones dumb enough

621
00:31:44,932 --> 00:31:47,759
To believe that.
- Hey. So some of us were wondering

622
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:49,754
If you're gonna go
to monkey bar.

623
00:31:50,763 --> 00:31:53,194
You know, just because
someone has to be on top,</i>

624
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,205
Doesn't mean
it has to be blair.

625
00:31:59,312 --> 00:32:03,011
Now when you get downstairs, You'll find
limos waiting to take you to the club.

626
00:32:03,164 --> 00:32:05,548
And no sticking your head
out the sunroof.

627
00:32:05,598 --> 00:32:07,955
This isn't
east ridge high school prom.

628
00:32:09,904 --> 00:32:11,757
- Bye.
- hello. Hey, uh, excuse me.

629
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:13,354
Could i get
everyone's attention, please ?

630
00:32:13,404 --> 00:32:16,971
Hey. Hi. Hello. I'm dan. I just
want to let everybody know here

631
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:20,135
That, uh,
blair waldorf over there

632
00:32:20,185 --> 00:32:22,460
Invited some people
from georgina's past

633
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:25,427
Just so she could embarrass her.
But you know,

634
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:27,032
We're--We're all starting
college here, and college is

635
00:32:26,982 --> 00:32:29,260
Supposed to be a place
where you're not judged

636
00:32:29,506 --> 00:32:31,446
By what you believe
or--Or the friends you make.

637
00:32:31,496 --> 00:32:33,466
You're here to make new friends
and start over, right ?

638
00:32:33,516 --> 00:32:35,638
So last time i checked,
i mean, i think--

639
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:38,491
I think this--This party's pretty fun ?
- yeah.

640
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:41,943
Yeah, okay. So...
who wants to leave with blair ?

641
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,079
All right,
and who wants to stay here

642
00:32:57,441 --> 00:32:59,554
Thank you.
You didn't have to do that.

643
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:00,858
Yeah, i did.

644
00:33:03,326 --> 00:33:04,583
Let's get a beer.

645
00:33:07,025 --> 00:33:11,311
<i>Uh-Oh, b. Looks like your
new flock was just led astray,</i>

646
00:33:11,504 --> 00:33:13,618
<i>And by dan humphrey no less.</i>

647
00:33:13,771 --> 00:33:16,577
<i>I guess they know a false
prophet when they see one.</i>

648
00:33:30,338 --> 00:33:31,152
Hi.

649
00:33:31,775 --> 00:33:34,088
- You mind if i join you ?
- It's your home.

650
00:33:37,966 --> 00:33:39,586
Dan told you i was here ?

651
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:41,876
I was...

652
00:33:43,684 --> 00:33:46,646
Glad you felt like
you could come here,

653
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,393
That you felt like
this was a safe place.

654
00:33:50,802 --> 00:33:52,434
I'm really sorry, rufus.

655
00:33:52,845 --> 00:33:55,184
I never meant for it
to get this messed up.

656
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:56,687
None of it was your fault.

657
00:33:56,737 --> 00:33:58,284
Well, i didn't help matters.

658
00:33:58,334 --> 00:34:01,242
I shouldn't have blown up at you
the way that i did.

659
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,656
So... talk to me.

660
00:34:13,658 --> 00:34:15,253
Well, um...

661
00:34:17,108 --> 00:34:18,494
I called brown

662
00:34:18,544 --> 00:34:20,619
And deferred for a year.

663
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:25,035
Okay.

664
00:34:25,085 --> 00:34:27,783
It may have been for
the wrong reasons at the time,

665
00:34:27,947 --> 00:34:28,910
I-I think.

666
00:34:29,262 --> 00:34:33,513
Well, no, i-I know that
it was the right decision.

667
00:34:33,675 --> 00:34:36,105
I would have just been going
because my mom wanted me to go,

668
00:34:36,155 --> 00:34:38,877
And while that's a good reason,
that's not good enough.

669
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,865
You know,
i did the same thing.

670
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:43,060
Well, it was rutgers,
not brown,

671
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:46,851
But i got in and i realized that if i
didn't pursue music, I'd never do it.

672
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:49,881
I wish i had
that same sense of purpose.

673
00:34:49,931 --> 00:34:53,477
But i hope that if i--If i take
this time, that i'll find it.

674
00:34:58,391 --> 00:34:59,389
Gosh.

675
00:35:00,352 --> 00:35:02,137
How am i gonna tell my mom ?

676
00:35:04,027 --> 00:35:07,353
Maybe i could help you figure that out.
I know i'm not the first guy

677
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:09,471
That your mom's brought
into your life,

678
00:35:10,492 --> 00:35:12,388
But if you and eric
will let me,

679
00:35:13,597 --> 00:35:15,922
I'd really like
to be more to you than...

680
00:35:16,885 --> 00:35:19,057
Than just
lily's most recent husband.

681
00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:22,557
Let me help you with this.

682
00:35:25,046 --> 00:35:26,209
Wow. I, uh...

683
00:35:27,606 --> 00:35:29,931
I would really appreciate that,
rufus.

684
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:34,184
I'm sorry, mom.

685
00:35:34,234 --> 00:35:36,861
It wasn't my intention
to embarrass you or daddy.

686
00:35:38,082 --> 00:35:39,726
i wouldn't be
doing any of this

687
00:35:39,776 --> 00:35:42,669
If i didn't feel the way that i do.
I really, really like him, and...

688
00:35:42,845 --> 00:35:45,064
Mom, please, don't be like that...

689
00:35:46,029 --> 00:35:46,933
Mom ?

690
00:35:51,498 --> 00:35:53,612
I guess we didn't fool
the doorman.

691
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,157
So you told your mom
the truth ?

692
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,187
I didn't want to risk
everything with my family

693
00:36:02,237 --> 00:36:04,530
For some fling
that wasn't gonna last.

694
00:36:05,434 --> 00:36:06,420
But ?

695
00:36:07,418 --> 00:36:09,802
if your family can accept us together,

696
00:36:09,978 --> 00:36:11,578
Maybe one day mine will,
too.

697
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:14,196
And if not ?

698
00:36:16,485 --> 00:36:18,672
It's a risk
that i'm willing to take.

699
00:36:25,658 --> 00:36:28,043
There's a reason
we never went downtown--

700
00:36:28,093 --> 00:36:29,361
It's awful.

701
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:31,373
The minute you cross
14th street,

702
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:33,580
People forget
there's a class system.

703
00:36:33,956 --> 00:36:36,268
B, you will find your place.
Just give it time.

704
00:36:36,597 --> 00:36:39,074
No, i found my place,
and it's at the bottom.

705
00:36:39,438 --> 00:36:42,153
It's a point of pride
now that i see who's on top.

706
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:45,206
Anyway, it's all turned out
for the best.

707
00:36:45,256 --> 00:36:46,603
If i hadn't
been so distracted,

708
00:36:46,653 --> 00:36:48,396
I would've been able
to force you to go to brown.

709
00:36:48,446 --> 00:36:51,035
That's sweet, but no,
you wouldn't have.

710
00:36:51,563 --> 00:36:53,656
I am sorry i pulled
a disappearing act on you.

711
00:36:53,706 --> 00:36:55,969
I'm sure you'll find a way
to make it up to me...

712
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,458
In the handbag department
at bendel's.

713
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,816
Now normally i'd be
more worried about brown,

714
00:37:01,866 --> 00:37:05,025
But you actually seem a lot
better than you have in a while.

715
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,104
I really am.

716
00:37:10,286 --> 00:37:11,436
It was so much easier

717
00:37:11,486 --> 00:37:14,366
When it was just about where
we sat on the met steps.

718
00:37:16,702 --> 00:37:18,041
Yeah, but we've...

719
00:37:18,734 --> 00:37:20,518
We've been here, done this.

720
00:37:21,101 --> 00:37:22,651
But i was so good at it.

721
00:37:23,673 --> 00:37:24,659
Well...

722
00:37:25,293 --> 00:37:28,205
Then it's time
for a new challenge...

723
00:37:28,557 --> 00:37:29,614
For both of us.

724
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,718
I'm glad
you're not going to brown.

725
00:37:32,082 --> 00:37:33,280
I need you here.

726
00:37:34,008 --> 00:37:34,923
Same.

727
00:37:41,754 --> 00:37:42,576
Bye.

728
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:43,539
Bye, you.

729
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:59,562
I'm sorry i'm late,

730
00:37:59,715 --> 00:38:01,899
But i have a good excuse.

731
00:38:05,362 --> 00:38:06,407
What is this ?

732
00:38:06,457 --> 00:38:08,708
A review of all the professors
i had this summer.

733
00:38:08,758 --> 00:38:10,769
And look,
i even gave 'em grades.

734
00:38:11,263 --> 00:38:13,869
Wow. This is amazing.

735
00:38:14,715 --> 00:38:15,775
I'm sorry...

736
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:18,499
For that weird moment
with katie last night.

737
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,481
I think i got a little,
um, overwhelmed

738
00:38:22,127 --> 00:38:24,006
From meeting
all your friends.

739
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,055
That's okay.

740
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:30,507
That was kind of the least weird
part of the whole night.

741
00:38:31,611 --> 00:38:32,906
yeah, when dan--
He got on the mike

742
00:38:32,956 --> 00:38:36,336
And he convinced everyone
to stay at the party, That was insane.

743
00:38:37,193 --> 00:38:38,355
Is he usually like that ?

744
00:38:38,405 --> 00:38:41,731
No.  dan is more of
a corner-Of-The-Party guy.

745
00:38:44,336 --> 00:38:46,755
Should i call him,
see if he'll join us ?

746
00:38:47,378 --> 00:38:50,442
Call him later. I just want
to be with you right now.

747
00:39:06,419 --> 00:39:07,412
What do you want,
serena ?

748
00:39:07,462 --> 00:39:09,643
There's a reason i always
come back to you, carter,

749
00:39:09,693 --> 00:39:13,242
And it's not because you're my bad habit.
- What then ?

750
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:17,769
You're the only one who understood
Why i needed to find my father.

751
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:21,023
You were there for me during
all of that, and i trust you.

752
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,945
Anyone would have done
the same thing.

753
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,486
No, they wouldn't have.

754
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:29,715
And i don't want anyone else.

755
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:32,597
I want you.

756
00:40:15,554 --> 00:40:16,411
Mm.

757
00:40:18,841 --> 00:40:20,732
You were right
about the dorms.

758
00:40:23,792 --> 00:40:25,294
The lighting is awful.

759
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:30,981
Are you okay ?

760
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:33,165
Mm.

761
00:40:33,787 --> 00:40:34,820
I am now.

762
00:40:59,914 --> 00:41:00,577
Hello ?

763
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:02,527
Hey. Do you want
to meet me and scott

764
00:41:02,577 --> 00:41:04,593
So we can download about
the epicness last night ?

765
00:41:04,643 --> 00:41:07,313
Mm. No, you know,
i'm still a little wrecked,

766
00:41:07,363 --> 00:41:10,154
So, uh, i'll--
I'll call you later.

767
00:41:10,204 --> 00:41:11,693
Okay. Bye.

768
00:41:23,268 --> 00:41:25,088
<i>Apparently,
higher education</i>

769
00:41:25,138 --> 00:41:27,438
<i>Doesn't make
for smarter decisions.</i>

770
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,091
<i>So take out your notebooks
and sharpen your pencils, kids.</i>

771
00:41:31,244 --> 00:41:33,415
<i>Gossip girl's going to college,</i>

772
00:41:33,465 --> 00:41:35,530
<i>And this class has
a lot to learn.</i>

773
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,974
