<i>into the scandalous life
of Manhattan's elite.</i>

3
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:08,424
I love you. That's not really
the reaction I was hoping for.

4
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:10,926
- What is it?
- It's from my dad and it's been opened.

5
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,746
You don't get
to judge me ever again.

6
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,763
Tell me that you didn't sleep
with him.

7
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,667
I did kiss him, but that's all.

8
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,852
You have the wrong idea.
I'm not some sort of trophy husband.

9
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:23,230
It's okay. We all sacrifice
our independence for love.

10
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,892
- You took the wrong boat.
- No,

11
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,360
this is the one with the cash.
Mine had the "E" in it.

12
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,906
I spent 18 years accepting the fact
my mother was dead.

13
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,949
Your real mother would never turn
her back on a chance to now you.

14
00:00:34,128 --> 00:00:37,578
- I don't have a real mother, Blair.
- It doesn't mean you're alone.

15
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,233
We should try to take this slow.

16
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:41,874
I was thinking the same thing.

17
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,379
This wasn't a date.
If you want one, you'll have to ask.

26
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:15,658
What are you even doing here?

27
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:17,726
Your stepmom doesn't get up
before noon.

28
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:20,219
But if she doesn't, you'll be spending
the day in my closet.

29
00:01:20,984 --> 00:01:21,963
Kinky.

30
00:01:22,485 --> 00:01:24,613
All right, I'll go.
Are we still on for tonight?

31
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,962
Oh, yeah I was thinking Italian.
Maybe Morandi or Il Buco?

32
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,923
If you don't want to go downtown,
we could just walk over to Tony's.

33
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:34,655
Not that I don't love popcorn
and a movie,

34
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,996
but it's Saturday night.
I wanted to go out.

35
00:01:37,121 --> 00:01:37,904
We are.

36
00:01:38,029 --> 00:01:40,933
In fact, we have half a dozen deliveries
to make at some parties.

37
00:01:41,138 --> 00:01:44,437
- Again? You're the only dealer in town?
- No rest for the wicked.

38
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,361
I'm gonna have to leave these here
for the day if that's cool.

39
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,817
Jenny's drug way station.

40
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,862
I guess that's the good thing
about my parents' huge fight.

41
00:01:53,893 --> 00:01:55,274
I can think of others.

42
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:00,411
Hey, don't you wanna answer that?

43
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:07,710
Hello, father.

44
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,378
No, I can't this evening.

45
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,423
I have plans.

46
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,259
Just a friend.

47
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:20,848
All right,
shall we take care of this?

48
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:24,477
What?

49
00:02:25,617 --> 00:02:26,353
Nothing.

50
00:02:32,724 --> 00:02:34,361
Since when do you cook?

51
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,857
I didn't even know
we had a fridge until this morning.

52
00:02:38,665 --> 00:02:39,950
We're not heathens.

53
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:41,516
Stop.

54
00:03:32,822 --> 00:03:36,771
- I told you I was good in the kitchen.
- The olives I could've done without.

55
00:03:36,896 --> 00:03:39,207
- Not really a breakfast food.
- I'm still hungry.

56
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,136
Doesn't Rufus make brunch
on Saturdays?

57
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:43,639
I prefer this breakfast.

58
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,683
<i>Oh, God!</i>

59
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,749
- Oh, God.
- <i>Chuck!</i>

60
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:49,591
Of course. Not to be outdone.

61
00:03:50,768 --> 00:03:51,982
God forbid.

62
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,191
<i>Yes! That's it! God.</i>

63
00:03:54,605 --> 00:03:55,651
<i>Yes!</i>

64
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:58,362
<i>Oh, don't stop! God, Chuck!</i>

65
00:03:58,551 --> 00:04:01,490
- <i>Oh, God, that's it! Yeah!</i>
- Hello?

66
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:02,992
- Hey, it's me.
- Chuck?

67
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,901
- Where are you?
- Early meeting.

68
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:08,122
I forgot my cell.
Can you stick it in my briefcase?

69
00:04:10,268 --> 00:04:14,226
- Blair is sort of in there right now.
- Which is why you need to grab it.

70
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:16,488
She can get curious,
and this is not a good time.

71
00:04:17,902 --> 00:04:19,004
Yeah, man. I will do.

72
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,224
Great.

73
00:04:21,463 --> 00:04:23,596
<i>Yes! God, Chuck!</i>

74
00:04:54,957 --> 00:04:56,650
<i>God, Chuck!</i>

75
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:58,172
<i>Yes!</i>

76
00:04:58,343 --> 00:05:00,841
- <i>Oh, God, Chuck!</i>
- Blair?

77
00:05:01,012 --> 00:05:03,677
Yes, right there! Oh!

78
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,389
- Haven't you heard of knocking?
- I did knock, but you didn't hear me.

79
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,275
- We heard you, though.
- I'm sorry.

80
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:12,299
- Was it awkward?
- Are you trying to prove a point?

81
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,188
Yes. But I shouldn't have to.

82
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:16,482
I'm just glad I got
Chuck's couch scotchgarded.

83
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:18,317
Now if you'll excuse me,

84
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,986
Louis Vuitton is doing
metallic booties for spring.

85
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:37,349
Talk to me.

86
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,505
Tell me what's wrong.

87
00:05:45,188 --> 00:05:47,479
Chuck and I aren't connecting
right now.

88
00:05:48,972 --> 00:05:50,167
You mean...

89
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:53,192
Not just like that.

90
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:55,744
But thanks so much for
the constant reminder.

91
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:56,862
Sorry.

92
00:06:00,907 --> 00:06:04,247
He's shutting me out
in his head all the time.

93
00:06:04,506 --> 00:06:07,199
Normally, I'd chalk it up
to just him being him.

94
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,764
But last week he
went through something,

95
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:13,899
and...

96
00:06:16,121 --> 00:06:20,087
If he's still upset, I just want him
to be able to talk to me.

97
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:22,751
How do you usually
pull these things out of him?

98
00:06:22,876 --> 00:06:26,552
Pretty much what you just heard,
sans fashion magazine.

99
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:28,142
I've tried all my tricks.

100
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:29,888
He's not interested.

101
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:32,182
I just wanna make him feel better.

102
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:41,775
Bit overdressed, aren't we?

103
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,201
I have an extra pair of board shorts
if you want to join me.

104
00:06:44,326 --> 00:06:45,487
Hit Ocean Drive?

105
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:49,575
Maybe some other time.

106
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,252
Listen to me.
All right, I know I screwed up,

107
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:02,880
and I don't blame you for
not returning my calls.

108
00:07:04,015 --> 00:07:05,090
But I miss you.

109
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:08,014
And what I said at the hospital,
it was as a friend, only as a friend.

110
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:10,572
- It's cool. You don't have to explain.
- No, I really do

111
00:07:11,857 --> 00:07:13,390
I want things to be like before.

112
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:16,810
We hang out today, remind ourselves
how normal it can be between us.

113
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,064
- The dorm's throwing a party tonight.
- Great, I love parties.

114
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,524
- And I'm going with Paul.
- I love Paul.

115
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,468
Don't you think
that it would be weird?

116
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,863
- Weird? No, I'll bring a date.
- What date?

117
00:07:28,506 --> 00:07:30,040
If you would've returned one

118
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:33,077
of my 10,000 phone calls,
you'd know that I'm seeing someone.

119
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,912
It's not serious at all, but...

120
00:07:36,731 --> 00:07:38,087
It'll be fun and normal.

121
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:41,129
Fine. The party starts in an hour.

122
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:42,359
All right.

123
00:07:43,938 --> 00:07:44,798
Wait.

124
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:46,799
What's her name?

125
00:07:47,337 --> 00:07:48,342
Melissa.

126
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:49,805
Melissa.

127
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,346
It's a good name. See you soon.

128
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,981
Hey, do you know
a girl named Melissa?

129
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:51,613
Everybody decent in here?

130
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,576
- Got it.
- What are you doing?

131
00:08:56,248 --> 00:08:57,953
My phone's dead.
I was gonna use Chuck's.

132
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,832
There's a phone in the living room.

133
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,284
- I know. I wanted to check a tweet.
- Wait.

134
00:09:03,859 --> 00:09:06,174
Chuck asked you to grab his phone
when he called, didn't he?

135
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:07,838
- Chuck called?
- No.

136
00:09:09,034 --> 00:09:09,889
I mean, yes.

137
00:09:10,014 --> 00:09:12,865
He doesn't want to forget his phone,
he asked me to put it in his briefcase.

138
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,927
I miss that.

139
00:09:14,522 --> 00:09:17,181
- What?
- Dating someone who's a horrible liar.

140
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,808
So much easier.
Chuck didn't want me to see his phone.

141
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:21,997
Hand it over, Archibald.

142
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,614
There's half a dozen calls
from a number

143
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:34,803
I've never seen,

144
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:37,701
and... a message.

145
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:46,413
I was just going out for a coffee...

146
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:47,882
Hi, Lily.

147
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,838
You're up really early.

148
00:09:50,062 --> 00:09:52,674
You remember Damien, right?
He just stopped by.

149
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,158
What is going on here?

150
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:55,594
Or do I even have to ask?

151
00:09:57,913 --> 00:09:59,181
Lily, I'm...

152
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:02,294
I'm so sorry.
Please, don't tell my dad.

153
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,310
Please.

154
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,395
I want both of you
in the living room now.

155
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,473
You, get dressed.

156
00:10:09,402 --> 00:10:12,110
I shouldn't.
I turned over a new leaf,

157
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,154
a new, non-meddling leaf
from the trust tree.

158
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:16,406
If he want keep secrets, then...

159
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,634
But he shouldn't.

160
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,173
Something is bothering him,
and he's not telling me about it.

161
00:10:20,298 --> 00:10:22,166
What am I supposed to do, right?

162
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,206
Blair, put the phone down,

163
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:26,038
and talk to him when he gets home.

164
00:10:30,668 --> 00:10:31,454
What?

165
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:34,508
It's this number. It's the same number
he called me from this morning.

166
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:42,173
<i>Charles, it's me again.</i>

167
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:44,856
<i>I know I keep calling,
but you haven't returned,</i>

168
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:47,479
<i>and there are things you need to know,
things I need to tell you.</i>

169
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,991
<i>I'm still at the Algonquin
but I'm checking out today.</i>

170
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,650
<i>I hope you'll change your mind.</i>

171
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,777
Elizabeth Fisher was staying there.

172
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:57,144
- Who's Elizabeth Fisher?
- Her name used to be Evelyn,

173
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,784
and she's my mother.

174
00:11:01,942 --> 00:11:03,112
<i>And just like that,</i>

175
00:11:03,473 --> 00:11:06,164
<i>we get the mother of all questions.</i>

176
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,717
Chuck, how is that even possible?

177
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:18,604
Bart told you your mother died.

178
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:20,804
He also told me kids
wear suits to kindergarten

179
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:22,567
and that blue chip stocks

180
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,558
are great for birthday gifts.

181
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,476
He told me
what he wanted me to believe.

182
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:30,480
Chuck ran into a woman at Bart's grave
and tracked her down.

183
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,400
She told us she was just
one of Bart's friends,

184
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,943
but I guess...

185
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,352
- You okay?
- Why wouldn't I be?

186
00:11:38,477 --> 00:11:39,531
You're not excited.

187
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,828
After this time of thinking your mother
is gone, now you have a second chance.

188
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,731
A chance for what?
Why even come back?

189
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,293
She's here now. Who cares why?

190
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:49,328
I've got a pretty good idea
what her motivation is.

191
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,544
Throw this away.

192
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,195
- Chuck, no.
- Serena, just...

193
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,507
You have no idea what happened
20 years ago, why she stayed away.

194
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,279
- You have to at least let her explain.
- No, I really don't.

195
00:12:00,794 --> 00:12:03,240
I'm going to the bar for a drink.

196
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:05,974
If you're planning on doing
any more sleuthing behind my back,

197
00:12:06,177 --> 00:12:08,852
I can leave you
the combination for the hotel safe.

198
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:14,127
- He's gonna be fine.
- He's being crazy.

199
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:17,319
- What are we gonna do?
- Nothing.

200
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,560
You didn't see him
when he confronted this woman,

201
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:21,969
and she sent him away.
He's had enough pain in his life.

202
00:12:22,094 --> 00:12:24,576
If he doesn't wanna hear her story,
then I'm gonna respect that,

203
00:12:24,796 --> 00:12:26,036
and so will you.

204
00:12:31,693 --> 00:12:35,640
I'm gonna take off. I don't really feel
like playing the scared boyfriend role.

205
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,845
No one's asking you
to play the boyfriend role.

206
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,641
Okay, Lily, what's so important
that you couldn't tell me on the phone?

207
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,359
Well, Jenny had a friend
stay over last night,

208
00:12:50,484 --> 00:12:53,021
and I thought it would be
a good idea for us to talk about it.

209
00:13:18,316 --> 00:13:20,924
So how long have you and Vanessa known
each other?

210
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,095
We've been best friends
since we were kids.

211
00:13:23,912 --> 00:13:25,322
I was talking to Paul.

212
00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:27,055
Right. Of course.

213
00:13:27,258 --> 00:13:29,433
Paul and I met at a cabaret
last semester.

214
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,269
And the theme was fairy tales,
so it's only appropriate that I met

215
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,896
- my prince charming.
- Actually, Dan was prince charming.

216
00:13:35,099 --> 00:13:37,190
- Where did you and Dan meet?
- In the hallway. He...

217
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:39,807
I was lost.
This building can be very tricky

218
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,903
when you don't live here.

219
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:46,450
- Let's go hit a beach ball around.
- Yeah. Sure.

220
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,949
Are we gonna talk
about what's going on here?

221
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,246
More drinks first.

222
00:14:08,191 --> 00:14:09,299
I'm sorry.

223
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:10,917
But...

224
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,312
A Blair Waldorf apology

225
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,655
without a caveat?

226
00:14:17,495 --> 00:14:18,482
Sounds serious.

227
00:14:19,188 --> 00:14:20,942
Which is why I'm here
if you wanna talk.

228
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:25,336
Or if you don't.

229
00:14:36,388 --> 00:14:38,435
Even if she is my mother,

230
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:40,504
she isn't.

231
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:42,713
It doesn't change anything.

232
00:14:43,944 --> 00:14:45,761
The past belongs to the past.

233
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:55,364
I think we should go
to Bart's grave one last time,

234
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,592
drop that of and never look back.

235
00:15:04,428 --> 00:15:05,445
Come here.

236
00:15:12,835 --> 00:15:15,038
Where do I even start?
How could you let this happen?

237
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,642
I didn't let anything happen.

238
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,124
Jenny is not Serena.

239
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,890
Contrary to popular belief,
children need boundaries.

240
00:15:21,015 --> 00:15:22,212
Excuse me, sir.

241
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,297
The truth is,
we fell asleep watching TV.

242
00:15:24,513 --> 00:15:26,967
I know that sounds like
"teenage excuses for dummies."

243
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,059
I appreciate
that you're a concerned father...

244
00:15:29,184 --> 00:15:31,304
The worst part of being
a father of a teenage girl

245
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:33,390
is remembering when
you were a teenage boy.

246
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,476
- Pack your bags You're coming with me.
- What? Where, dad? I live here.

247
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,229
- Not anymore. You're back to Brooklyn.
- Dad, you can't do that.

248
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,357
- Pack your bags or I will.
- Okay, fine. I'll do it myself.

249
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:46,403
- Rufus, can we please talk about this?
- No, Lily, we can't.

250
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:49,823
While she's packing her stuff,
maybe I'll go grab what's left of mine.

251
00:16:04,126 --> 00:16:06,923
- Where's Melissa?
- Uh, oh, she's salsa dancing. Paul?

252
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:10,302
She seems nice.

253
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:13,425
- I knew this was gonna be weird.
- How so?

254
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,292
We're not
in a friendship groove here.

255
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,976
- There's too much pressure.
- Too much? There's no pressure.

256
00:16:18,615 --> 00:16:21,816
Problem solved. What could be friendlier
than taking a mock photo?

257
00:16:22,244 --> 00:16:23,244
Come on.

258
00:16:50,294 --> 00:16:51,644
- Photo?
- Huh?

259
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,512
- Right. That was...
- You know, it's...

260
00:16:54,637 --> 00:16:57,045
it's all these mojitos,
the confined space and the heat.

261
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,320
Right. Miami.
Um, so photo?

262
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,270
We come in peace.

263
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:10,027
We're here for ya.

264
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,883
We made reservations at Kellari.

265
00:17:12,008 --> 00:17:13,657
Greeks know how to do comfort food.

266
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,125
What do you say?

267
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,300
I guess I could use the walk...

268
00:17:17,425 --> 00:17:19,275
And some food in my system.

269
00:17:24,447 --> 00:17:27,282
- You sure we're doing the right thing?
- It's his mother.

270
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:29,422
You know Chuck. He just
needs a little push.

271
00:17:29,861 --> 00:17:33,278
<i>Careful, S.
You may think you know what's best,</i>

272
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:36,553
but this time, you might
just be pushing your Chuck.

273
00:17:53,354 --> 00:17:54,793
- What?
- Nothing.

274
00:17:54,918 --> 00:17:57,569
Our drinks would be nice,
maybe some bread for the table.

275
00:17:57,694 --> 00:17:59,494
You haven't eaten bread
since middle school.

276
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,746
So, buddy, uh, how you
holding up? You good?

277
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,081
Yeah, I'm fine.

278
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,870
No, it wasn't me.

279
00:18:17,187 --> 00:18:19,472
- We called her.
- We think you're making a big mistake,

280
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,517
one you'll regret for the rest of your
life. Why not just listen?

281
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,019
- That's it. Let's go.
- Blair, you know I'm right.

282
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,849
No matter what he says now, he'll always
wonder, and it will eat away at him.

283
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,067
She's here now,
and she wants to talk to you.

284
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,571
Whatever she has to say,
it's better than not knowing.

285
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,492
Fine.

286
00:19:03,578 --> 00:19:06,186
- I forgot our drinks.
- Melissa and I already grabbed some.

287
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:08,646
And we got to talking.

288
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:10,324
He was surprised to find out

289
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,635
- we just met this morning.
- This morning?

290
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,505
Right before you called and told me
you wanted to get back together.

291
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,830
Back together?

292
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:20,793
How do you feel about salsa dancing?

293
00:19:20,918 --> 00:19:22,707
I can explain.
Can you just wait one second?

294
00:19:22,832 --> 00:19:25,455
No, we get it, even if you don't.
And whatever's going on between you two

295
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,874
either do something
or don't do something about it.

296
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:31,711
But, please, don't bring normal
people into whatever this is.

297
00:19:35,143 --> 00:19:36,593
This was a mistake.

298
00:19:39,026 --> 00:19:42,243
I was brought here
under false pretenses.

299
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,350
Your friend Serena told
me that you know who I am.

300
00:19:47,648 --> 00:19:49,854
"Friend" is a pretty
loose term right now.

301
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:53,658
- They're talking.
- See? I knew if they got together

302
00:19:53,783 --> 00:19:55,610
Eat your spanakopita.

303
00:19:59,018 --> 00:20:01,820
- I don't know where to start.
- If it's all the same to you,

304
00:20:01,945 --> 00:20:04,035
why don't we skip
to the end of the story?

305
00:20:04,976 --> 00:20:06,426
I'm... I'm sorry?

306
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,583
- What's he doing?
- Oh, Chuck.

307
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,401
I know why you're here.

308
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:14,712
Yes, to-to talk.

309
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:18,333
Really? Well, we'll see
how much you want to talk,

310
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,458
because...

311
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:22,053
I bet it's not as much...

312
00:20:22,914 --> 00:20:23,721
as this.

313
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:27,225
She doesn't want the money.
She won't take it.

314
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:28,810
She just wants to talk to him.

315
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:32,438
- I'm going over there.
- Serena, sit your ass down.

316
00:20:40,517 --> 00:20:42,782
No judgment, no strings attached,

317
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:44,492
but one.

318
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,956
I don't want to know your story.

319
00:20:51,796 --> 00:20:53,710
I want to know you'll leave

320
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:56,028
and never come back.

321
00:21:05,737 --> 00:21:07,181
This is really what you want?

322
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:15,815
I'm sorry, Charles.

323
00:21:17,622 --> 00:21:18,943
You're right.

324
00:21:24,506 --> 00:21:27,619
An expensive lunch, but it was worth it.
By the way, you were wrong.

325
00:21:37,701 --> 00:21:40,757
What are you still doing here?
Do you want my dad to kill you?

326
00:21:43,142 --> 00:21:46,262
Right. Well, I assume you're
not leaving without these.

327
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,244
I will be taking these, but...

328
00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:50,908
I actually came to say goodbye.

329
00:21:53,157 --> 00:21:54,157
Okay.

330
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:56,814
Well, goodbye... friend.

331
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,777
That's what you called me
on the phone to your dad, right?

332
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,526
- So?
- So I'm getting exiled to Brooklyn

333
00:22:03,651 --> 00:22:06,366
because of our relationship,
and I don't even know if we have one.

334
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:13,234
You're in high school.

335
00:22:14,327 --> 00:22:17,345
- Your father's not out of line.
- Okay.

336
00:22:27,774 --> 00:22:29,474
You know, wait a second.

337
00:22:30,261 --> 00:22:33,309
I'm not gonna go write your name
in a heart on my binder, okay?

338
00:22:33,807 --> 00:22:36,212
But you cannot expect me to
start world war III with my dad

339
00:22:36,337 --> 00:22:39,524
without even giving me
something to fight for.

340
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,443
What difference does it make?
Your father won't let you see me again.

341
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,446
Okay, now who's in high school?
I fight with my dad all the time.

342
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,198
Last year I ran away.

343
00:22:47,894 --> 00:22:50,660
- I'm not afraid to stand up to him.
- Jenny?

344
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,497
What are you doing?

345
00:22:59,298 --> 00:23:00,679
Whose are these?

346
00:23:03,438 --> 00:23:04,588
They're mine.

347
00:23:05,647 --> 00:23:09,335
<i>Watch your step, little J.
Damien may be your drug of choice,</i>

348
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,724
<i>but it looks like this
love could be bad medicine.</i>

349
00:23:17,056 --> 00:23:20,064
- Look, I can explain.
- Oh, believe me, you will.

350
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,525
Right now.

351
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:24,716
- Did you know about this?
- No Rufus,

352
00:23:24,841 --> 00:23:27,254
I did not know
about a giant bag of pills.

353
00:23:31,715 --> 00:23:33,165
What are you doing?

354
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:36,529
I may be a bitch, but
I'm not a little bitch.

355
00:23:36,654 --> 00:23:38,504
I told you I wasn't afraid.

356
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:49,140
Are you taking these or selling them?
I want the truth.

357
00:23:49,655 --> 00:23:50,928
They're for a friend.

358
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,057
- Please don't make this worse.
- Okay I don't get what the big deal is.

359
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,267
You didn't spend
years on the tour bus reading.

360
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,103
There's a huge difference between
sharing a joint with my bassist

361
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,189
and getting caught with
a sack of narcotics.

362
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,692
This is serious, Jenny.

363
00:24:06,063 --> 00:24:07,063
Okay.

364
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:10,073
So let's just get it over with
then. Am I grounded for life?

365
00:24:10,396 --> 00:24:12,575
- Military school? What?
- Probably both.

366
00:24:13,074 --> 00:24:14,619
This goes way past that, Jenny.

367
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,380
See, I look at you

368
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:19,548
and I don't see my daughter anymore.

369
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:26,363
The drugs don't belong to Jenny.

370
00:24:28,617 --> 00:24:29,717
They're mine.

371
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,888
Actually, they're my father's.

372
00:24:38,802 --> 00:24:39,811
Chuck, wait.

373
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,687
You were looking for
a fairy-tale ending.

374
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,856
Next time rent a movie.
Leave me out of I.

375
00:24:45,881 --> 00:24:47,360
I just wanted him to have answers.

376
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,737
Please. You and I both
know why you did this,

377
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,115
and it has nothing to do with Chuck.

378
00:24:52,837 --> 00:24:55,438
You're right.
I'm sorry. I should go.

379
00:24:55,563 --> 00:24:56,984
Hey, I'll go with you.

380
00:24:57,109 --> 00:24:59,831
Nate, I need to be alone right now.

381
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,439
What do you mean, it had
nothing to do with Chuck?

382
00:25:08,564 --> 00:25:09,423
Sorry, Nate.

383
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,471
- We need to talk about this.
- What?

384
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,822
- Our... our kiss.
- What's there to discuss?

385
00:25:17,947 --> 00:25:19,600
We both had too many mojitos.

386
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,265
Why did you lie
to me about dating Paul?

387
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,522
Because I knew
you had feelings for me,

388
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,924
and I didn't want things to be awkward
between us. And if I was dating Paul,

389
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:29,902
- then you won't get hopes.
- V, don't...

390
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,321
No, don't get all Dan Humphrey on me.
Melissa? Really?

391
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,878
All right, fine.
It's clearly not my best plan.

392
00:25:35,003 --> 00:25:38,244
I shouldn't lied to you, but I was
trying to protect our friendship.

393
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,799
I don't want you feel weird.

394
00:25:39,924 --> 00:25:43,749
That stopped being an option the minute
you old me you had feelings for me.

395
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,867
I wish you'd never done that.

396
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,633
I think I need another mojito.
I'll see you around.

397
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,629
So after my mother left,

398
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,154
I thought my father just
wanted to have a good time, but,

399
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,269
of course, it escalated,

400
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,188
and he started going on
these benders.

401
00:26:05,593 --> 00:26:08,941
One day he disappeared for two
days. I thought he was dead.

402
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,402
You didn't tell anyone?

403
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,821
I had no one to tell.
My mother certainly wasn't an option.

404
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,989
Then he came back in, filthy,

405
00:26:16,114 --> 00:26:19,368
with a broken arm and no recollection
of what had happened.

406
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,210
- Oh, my God.
- The good news was

407
00:26:21,335 --> 00:26:23,247
I think it scared him enough
that he got sober.

408
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,874
And I got my father back,

409
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:28,359
or least I thought I did, until I saw
these this morning in his room.

410
00:26:28,484 --> 00:26:31,700
That's when I came
over here, to see Jenny.

411
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:37,053
Jenny's really been here
for me lately.

412
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,568
And wile we're clearing
the air, I want you to know

413
00:26:39,693 --> 00:26:42,099
I didn't spend the night
in your home last night.

414
00:26:43,027 --> 00:26:44,560
Jenny was just trying to protect me.

415
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,854
By letting me believe
that Damien slept here?

416
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,814
I was distracting
you from seeing the pills.

417
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,816
I don't understand
why you brought the drugs.

418
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,652
I know it was completely reckless,

419
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,187
and I'm sorry for putting you...

420
00:26:56,892 --> 00:26:58,742
and Jenny in that position.

421
00:26:59,379 --> 00:27:02,579
I just thought if I got the pills
away from my dad...

422
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,880
that everything would be okay.

423
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,450
I'm sorry.

424
00:27:20,252 --> 00:27:21,639
Do you want to talk?

425
00:27:24,581 --> 00:27:25,581
Or...

426
00:27:27,582 --> 00:27:28,688
No talking.

427
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:47,790
Well, that was certainly
a crazy story.

428
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,561
Where'd you get that intervention?

429
00:27:50,114 --> 00:27:52,086
It sounded real.
They totally bought it.

430
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,463
Yeah, there's nothing to buy.
It's true...

431
00:27:54,711 --> 00:27:56,882
Oh, Damien, they're upstairs.
They can't hear you.

432
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,950
Except for the part about
my dad getting sober.

433
00:28:02,995 --> 00:28:04,181
I'm so sorry.

434
00:28:04,572 --> 00:28:05,772
I had no idea.

435
00:28:06,512 --> 00:28:07,810
No one does.

436
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:10,652
I'd leave except
I feel like if I disappear,

437
00:28:10,777 --> 00:28:13,777
he'd have absolutely
no reason to ever come home.

438
00:28:16,526 --> 00:28:18,426
I'm really glad you told me.

439
00:28:20,693 --> 00:28:24,697
Well, the pills have been flushed.
It's time for Damien to go, and us, too.

440
00:28:26,815 --> 00:28:30,515
Just be happy you have a father
who actually cares what you do.

441
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:40,134
Thanks, dad.

442
00:28:41,057 --> 00:28:43,554
I really liked Damien,
and he liked me.

443
00:28:45,287 --> 00:28:47,475
You're young. You'll get over it.
Get your suitcase.

444
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:05,034
I'm sorry. I need to leave.

445
00:29:05,988 --> 00:29:08,052
Can I just have a moment
of your time, please?

446
00:29:08,177 --> 00:29:10,760
Charles was pretty clear
about his feelings.

447
00:29:10,885 --> 00:29:13,084
It's not for him. It's for me.

448
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:15,644
<i>Well, S., looks like Chuck's mom</i>

449
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,172
<i>isn't the only one with baggage.</i>

450
00:29:24,645 --> 00:29:26,995
My dad left when
I was a little girl.

451
00:29:27,634 --> 00:29:31,065
I don't know when or
if I'll ever know why.

452
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:33,687
But I want to know why you left.

453
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:36,895
I know it must not be easy, but
I don't think you would have come back

454
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,420
if you didn't want
to tell your story.

455
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,782
I was 19 when I got pregnant,

456
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,785
nowhere near ready to be a mother.

457
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,621
We agreed I'd give the
baby up for adoption.

458
00:29:51,347 --> 00:29:54,449
But I saw a picture of you
holding Chuck in the locket.

459
00:29:54,574 --> 00:29:56,459
You couldn't go through with it?

460
00:29:56,584 --> 00:29:59,755
No. It was Bart who
couldn't go through with it.

461
00:30:00,387 --> 00:30:03,079
Once he saw his son, that was it.

462
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,458
He even asked me to marry him.

463
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:08,461
- You weren't married?
- Oh, no.

464
00:30:08,586 --> 00:30:09,974
And I wasn't about to be.

465
00:30:10,353 --> 00:30:12,768
I didn't love him. I told him that.

466
00:30:13,155 --> 00:30:14,714
So he blackmailed you

467
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,171
then told you that if you left,
you'd never see your son?

468
00:30:17,296 --> 00:30:19,859
I'm the one who told him
to tell Charles I was dead.

469
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:24,641
It was the only way I knew that
he'd never come looking for me.

470
00:30:24,766 --> 00:30:27,216
And that way
I could go on with my life

471
00:30:27,936 --> 00:30:29,636
as if he never happened.

472
00:30:30,605 --> 00:30:32,515
But you must have had regrets.

473
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,018
And knowing Bart, he wouldn't have
made it easy to come back. Right?

474
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,546
Bart sent me money every
year to keep me away.

475
00:30:41,225 --> 00:30:42,770
But truth is,

476
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:46,065
he didn't have to.

477
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,403
I didn't doubt my decision.

478
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:55,779
I know...

479
00:30:57,881 --> 00:31:00,431
This wasn't what
you were hoping to hear,

480
00:31:00,556 --> 00:31:02,193
but now you know why it's better

481
00:31:02,984 --> 00:31:04,445
if I just leave.

482
00:31:06,209 --> 00:31:07,615
My son wants to hate me.

483
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:10,067
I don't blame him.

484
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:20,377
You know, I've known
Chuck my whole life,

485
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,338
and he's better than anyone
I know at pushing people away.

486
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:28,120
I don't care what he says
or does, but there's no child

487
00:31:28,245 --> 00:31:30,695
that doesn't want
to know their parent.

488
00:31:54,036 --> 00:31:55,936
Can I talk to you for a sec?

489
00:31:56,287 --> 00:31:57,831
Yeah. Excuse me.

490
00:32:00,841 --> 00:32:02,757
Look, you're right.

491
00:32:02,882 --> 00:32:05,839
I lied to you about Paul and
then kissed you because...

492
00:32:07,894 --> 00:32:09,594
I have feelings for you.

493
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:14,890
I'm scared, because I don't
want to ruin our friendship.

494
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,226
- And neither do I.
- We're in this no-man's-land.

495
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,608
We aren't hooking up
because we want to stay friends,

496
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:21,549
we aren't friends
because we want to hook up.

497
00:32:21,674 --> 00:32:23,023
No one'swinning.

498
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,401
It's like we're so cautious
that we're ruining everything.

499
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:28,112
We're hurting our friendship
by-by not hooking up.

500
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,992
I think we should just throw
down and see what happens.

501
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:34,817
- If we go up in flames...
- at least we know we burned trying.

502
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:39,206
I'm scared.

503
00:32:57,251 --> 00:32:58,267
Dad, I'm sorry.

504
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:01,020
I know that I'm probably
grounded until I go to college,

505
00:33:01,937 --> 00:33:05,399
but please, is there any way
that Damien can have visitation rights?

506
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,360
I understand that you like Damien,
but you can't see him anymore.

507
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,707
- Dad...
- You lied to us to protect this boy.

508
00:33:10,832 --> 00:33:12,573
And whatever's happening
in his home life.

509
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:16,195
I can't have you spending time
with someone mixed up with drugs.

510
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,078
Lily, please. You get it, right?

511
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,998
Jenny, I'm sorry.
Your father is right.

512
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:24,124
Okay, you're just taking dad's side
because you guys are in a fight.

513
00:33:24,249 --> 00:33:26,337
This has nothing
to do with Lily and me.

514
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:30,049
Lily's sleeping till noon every day,
and you're hiding at the loft,

515
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:32,593
because you finally found
something that you guys can agree on,

516
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,179
- it doesn't mean that you're right.
- Where are you going?

517
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:39,224
I'll be waiting for you downstairs.
Let's just get this over with.

518
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,812
I wish you and Jenny would stay here,
and we could work through as a family.

519
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,462
Jenny needs a break from this world,
to be back in her old room,

520
00:33:46,587 --> 00:33:48,064
her feet on solid ground.

521
00:33:48,189 --> 00:33:50,361
And I think I need that too,
at least for a while.

522
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,307
I'm sorry for not telling
you about Elizabeth calling.

523
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:02,532
I wasn't trying to shut you out.

524
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,650
Then what was it?

525
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:07,711
I was hoping I could
find out who she was

526
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:10,938
without ever knowing
why she did what she did.

527
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:15,596
Writing the check was just a test.
But I wanted her to pass, not fail.

528
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:19,271
As soon as I handed it to her,
I didn't want her to take it.

529
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:25,594
It's the front desk.

530
00:34:27,188 --> 00:34:28,188
Hello?

531
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,210
Okay, Patricia, hold on.

532
00:34:34,395 --> 00:34:37,292
Elizabeth Fisher is in the lobby.

533
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,001
She wants to come up.

534
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,112
All right, you ready to go? Jenny?

535
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:50,703
<i>There comes a time</i>

536
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,550
<i>when every father learns
you can't keep a bad girl down.</i>

537
00:35:09,302 --> 00:35:12,392
- Nate, what are you doing here?
- Well, I thought you'd be here.

538
00:35:12,517 --> 00:35:13,767
Where'd you go?

539
00:35:15,248 --> 00:35:16,989
I went to see Chuck's mother.

540
00:35:18,345 --> 00:35:19,408
Why?

541
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:29,656
Because of my dad.

542
00:35:29,992 --> 00:35:31,754
I've been trying to find him.

543
00:35:32,238 --> 00:35:33,878
I just

544
00:35:34,003 --> 00:35:36,341
want to talk to him,
to understand why he left.

545
00:35:36,645 --> 00:35:39,553
I've come close to finding him.
I tracked him down last summer.

546
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:43,689
But, he didn't want to see me,

547
00:35:43,814 --> 00:35:45,851
and he wrote me a letter explaining.

548
00:35:47,413 --> 00:35:49,229
He was with my mother.

549
00:35:51,195 --> 00:35:52,649
That's why you've avoid your mom.

550
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:53,865
And I felt like

551
00:35:54,503 --> 00:35:56,862
somehow his letter meant something.

552
00:35:57,147 --> 00:36:00,636
You know? But the truth is,
he knows who I am now,

553
00:36:02,184 --> 00:36:03,577
and he hasn't come to find me.

554
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:07,826
I think talking to Elizabeth
made me finally realize

555
00:36:07,951 --> 00:36:11,335
that he just doesn't
want to be found.

556
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:14,838
Why didn't you tell me?

557
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,686
Things have been
so good with us, so fun.

558
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:23,811
I didn't want to bring
any heaviness into it,

559
00:36:24,229 --> 00:36:25,586
you know, ruin things.

560
00:36:25,947 --> 00:36:27,893
Yeah, I mean, this time
has been incredible.

561
00:36:28,162 --> 00:36:29,269
We broke my dresser.

562
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:34,000
And I'm enjoying every minute of it.

563
00:36:36,421 --> 00:36:38,862
I want to be that person
you can bring anything to,

564
00:36:40,342 --> 00:36:41,687
the good and the bad.

565
00:36:43,439 --> 00:36:44,200
Me, too.

566
00:36:48,246 --> 00:36:49,827
Did you ever think that maybe...

567
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,502
if that's the way your father feels,
he's not worth finding?

568
00:37:08,885 --> 00:37:11,395
I know it's probably not
the story you wanted to hear,

569
00:37:12,517 --> 00:37:14,064
I wanted you to know the truth.

570
00:37:14,487 --> 00:37:16,483
And I thought my father was
the heartless one.

571
00:37:17,912 --> 00:37:19,778
You have every right to hate me.

572
00:37:20,819 --> 00:37:23,156
- But I want to be in your life.
- For a price, of course.

573
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:31,759
I don't want this.

574
00:37:32,295 --> 00:37:34,293
I thought it would be better
if you could hate me,

575
00:37:34,902 --> 00:37:36,795
but it's better if you know me.

576
00:37:42,874 --> 00:37:44,386
I've decided to stay in New York.

577
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,638
I'm willing to wait
as long as it takes.

578
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,520
I want to know my son.

579
00:37:54,852 --> 00:37:55,814
Wait.

580
00:38:00,314 --> 00:38:02,791
It seems like all that money...

581
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:06,408
should at least buy you a drink.

582
00:38:11,466 --> 00:38:13,919
I was worried that it wasn't gonna be
as good without Olivia.

583
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:16,359
Yeah, it's almost like she
brought us down, I would say,

584
00:38:16,484 --> 00:38:18,045
- if I had to grade us.
- "A" minus?

585
00:38:19,735 --> 00:38:21,652
All right.
Well, I was gonna say "A" plus.

586
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:23,569
Well, minus for the first time,

587
00:38:23,694 --> 00:38:26,948
due to the elbow incident,
but after that, plus.

588
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:28,991
Plus, plus, plus.

589
00:38:34,503 --> 00:38:36,032
The reason,

590
00:38:36,929 --> 00:38:38,732
I was freaked out when you told me

591
00:38:39,331 --> 00:38:40,408
was because with us,

592
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,334
it feels like it's all or nothing.

593
00:38:42,459 --> 00:38:45,326
Yeah, I know. If we hooked up,
then it puts everything in fast-forward.

594
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,532
Like we'd have to be married
before graduation.

595
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,249
All of our friends would be getting
their first STDs,

596
00:38:50,374 --> 00:38:52,829
and we'd be celebrating
our first wedding anniversary.

597
00:38:53,774 --> 00:38:56,549
Let's just take it
one day at a time?

598
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,187
Keep being friends?

599
00:39:00,828 --> 00:39:02,982
Yeah.
As long as we can keep doing this.

600
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,968
You're gonna be in a lot of trouble.

601
00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:22,442
Yeah. You'd better make
my punishment worth it.

602
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,808
So my dad

603
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:27,093
might have flushed your stash,
but I raided Lily's medicine cabinet.

604
00:39:27,218 --> 00:39:29,721
- She sometimes gets headaches.
- It's a hell of a headache.

605
00:39:29,846 --> 00:39:31,161
We could go to the party

606
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,577
and sell those instead.

607
00:39:35,178 --> 00:39:35,875
Or...

608
00:39:37,045 --> 00:39:38,291
We could skip the party.

609
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,627
And do what?

610
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,894
No, miss Lily. It's me.

611
00:39:59,149 --> 00:40:00,439
Is that Rufus' scarf?

612
00:40:01,321 --> 00:40:03,859
It was turned in, lost and found.

613
00:40:04,931 --> 00:40:06,361
He wasn't wearing it today.

614
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:10,907
I did not want to say
this, but Dorota insist.

615
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:14,194
Miss Holland say...

616
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,455
Rufus left this at her apartment.

617
00:40:19,742 --> 00:40:22,836
I'm sure he was just down there
talking about rooftop garden.

618
00:40:24,971 --> 00:40:26,156
Thank you, Vanya.

619
00:40:26,587 --> 00:40:27,716
I'm sure that was it.

620
00:40:45,258 --> 00:40:47,268
Hey. It's me. Serena.

621
00:40:47,393 --> 00:40:49,374
I still don't know
if this is your number,

622
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:52,760
but I wanted you to know that...

623
00:40:54,434 --> 00:40:55,997
I'm not looking for you anymore.

624
00:40:57,478 --> 00:40:59,206
I thought
maybe you wanted to know me.

625
00:41:00,688 --> 00:41:02,767
But now it's me that
doesn't want to know you.

626
00:41:05,044 --> 00:41:05,907
I'm done.

627
00:41:14,211 --> 00:41:15,443
See you tomorrow.

628
00:41:15,821 --> 00:41:17,832
Enjoy your talk.
Call me in the morning.

629
00:41:17,957 --> 00:41:19,870
Thank you. I will.
