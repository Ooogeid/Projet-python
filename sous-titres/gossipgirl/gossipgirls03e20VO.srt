<i>Gossip Girl here,

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,171
<i>into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite.</i>

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,006
I raided Lily's medicine cabinet.

4
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,467
- She gets headaches.
- That's a hell of a headache.

5
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:10,968
We need a second opinion.

6
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,517
Even if you do go with another doctor,
I'm gonna stick around.

7
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:17,183
Are you Blair Waldorf? We haven't read
about you on "Gossip Girl" in forever.

8
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,769
- You read "Gossip Girl"?
- Of course. Everyone at Columbia does.

9
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,646
I called your cell
to explain everything.

10
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:23,105
I even left her a message.

11
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,536
- She's lying. I never talked to her.
- Just get out.

12
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,030
There's only one spot,
and I didn't get it.

13
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:29,236
I got the spot.

14
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,994
- Why weren't you honest?
- Like you,

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,616
going behind my back to apply
for the one thing I wanted the most?

16
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,409
IfI couldn't talk to you earlier,

17
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,370
it's not about my dad.
It was about my mom.

18
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,413
She's sick, and I don't know
what'llhappen.

19
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,248
It's not working
exactly as I'd hoped.

20
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,292
I need you to write Lily
another prescription.

21
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,179
I doubt the authorities would be pleased
to know what you've been doing.

I'm heading to my mom's
for breakfast.

35
00:01:56,852 --> 00:01:59,910
You're coming in late and leaving early
all week. I'm starting to feel cheap.

36
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,214
I'm sorry I haven't been
around much lately.

37
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:04,248
Just with everything going
so well with my dad.

38
00:02:06,325 --> 00:02:07,460
No worries.

39
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,132
I love being your crash pad,

40
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,843
but maybe you'd feel better
if you moved back in with your mom

41
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,148
while she's treated.

42
00:02:17,273 --> 00:02:19,638
And have to see Jenny's lying face
first thing in the morning?

43
00:02:20,472 --> 00:02:21,515
No, thank you.

44
00:02:23,073 --> 00:02:25,686
That is not the same girl
Chuck came home with last night.

45
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:29,687
Has he come to talk to Lily yet?

46
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:33,192
- Do you want me to talk to him?
- I already tried,

47
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,738
but thank you. I'llcome
to your lacrosse game after brunch.

48
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,531
Judge away.

49
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:39,366
Shame turns me on.

50
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,874
She's going to Lily's for brunch.
Maybe waffles will help your hangover?

51
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,752
I find the cause is the best cure.

52
00:02:54,222 --> 00:02:57,197
I gotta go. So I will see you later
at the library,

53
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,433
And I'm sorry about before
with the Tisch catalog.

54
00:03:01,857 --> 00:03:02,757
It's fine.

55
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:06,894
Dan, I don't know how to do this.

56
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,404
We've been tiptoeing
around each other for days.

57
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:12,107
We're two artists in a relationship,

58
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,943
and sometimes
we're gonna be competing,

59
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,464
So, all right, we're smart people.
Let's come up with...

60
00:03:18,218 --> 00:03:20,633
Some rules, a list of topics
that are off-limits.

61
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,785
Isn't that what got us in trouble?

62
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,907
No. This will be different,
because we'll know...

63
00:03:26,701 --> 00:03:27,920
what we don't know.

64
00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:30,042
Listen to me.
I'm quoting Donald Rumsfeld.

65
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,130
Until the sting of Tisch has worn off,
we shouldn't talk about classes.

66
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:35,590
Like, if you're taking

67
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:38,801
playwriting
with Sam Shepard, it may hurt my heart,

68
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,383
but if you take intro to mime,

69
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,361
I need to know everything. I want to be
here when you buy your leotard.

70
00:03:43,486 --> 00:03:46,536
Playwriting competitions, I think
we can go out for the same ones,

71
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:48,519
but we can't read
each other's submissions.

72
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,063
Looking forward, it's the same thing
with internships and jobs.

73
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,778
The only things
we can talk about openly

74
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:58,888
are politics, "jersey shore",

75
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,889
and where we want to eat...

76
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:05,286
Which reminds me,
I need to get ready.

77
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,151
I'm gonna be late for breakfast.
Are you sure you don't want to come?

78
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:11,709
- No, I'm sorry. I have something.
- Is it something related to our list?

79
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:14,420
Actually, yeah.

80
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,841
Thank you for not sharing.

81
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,386
I can't believe
how much easier that is.

82
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:29,602
Ooh! Another sext session
with your new B.F.?

83
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,897
I'd hardly call Elliot a boyfriend.

84
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,916
Between me spending
all my time with my mom

85
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,027
and him being in every club in school,
We haven't even been on a first date.

86
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,322
Still using cooking as therapy?

87
00:04:45,627 --> 00:04:46,493
Excuse me.

88
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:48,704
Sorry.

89
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:50,140
Good morning.

90
00:04:50,565 --> 00:04:53,125
Look at all of this food.
It's obscene.

91
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,790
- You okay?
- Please, everyone, relax.

92
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,917
What I need is
for the people who love me

93
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,992
to treat me like they always do.

94
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,277
Has anybody heard from Chuck?

95
00:05:03,663 --> 00:05:05,731
Yeah, he's sorry
he couldn't make it.

96
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,891
Charles has the right idea.

97
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,518
If he were here,
then I'd really worry.

98
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,090
One thing
I'll say about the treatment

99
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:16,762
is that I have not lost my appetite.

100
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,192
I want waffles.

101
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,611
Music to my ears.

102
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,653
Dad.

103
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,006
- What's he doing here?
- I invited him.

104
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,417
Looks great, Lil.
Really great.

105
00:05:36,338 --> 00:05:40,172
I hope you'll all cometo this doctors
without borders gala at Columbia.

106
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,841
I must admit, I feel a bit silly
about the whole thing.

107
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,053
Clearly, Columbia's run out
of alumni to honor,

108
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,305
if the best they could
come up with is... me.

109
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,932
False humility-check.

110
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,848
I'll be there. I invited Nate and Blair.
I really want them to get to know you.

111
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,855
Terrific. I'd be honored.

112
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:00,776
Rufus and I would love to come.

113
00:06:01,218 --> 00:06:03,028
Why don't you grab a plate?
Help yourself.

114
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,328
What?
He left when I was 2.

115
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,998
- He's a total stranger to me.
- You have to give him a chance.

116
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,758
- No, I don't.
- Okay, everyone.

117
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,669
Let's sit down
and enjoy this wonderful food.

118
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:22,381
Dad, here. Sit here.
Rufus, scoot over, please.

119
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:24,299
Please.

120
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,845
Thank you.

121
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:52,619
What's up?

122
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,528
I thought I'd come
and watch your lacrosse game.

123
00:06:55,653 --> 00:06:58,619
So if you could make sure
that there's a seat for me in V.I.P.,

124
00:06:58,744 --> 00:07:02,171
preferably next to an injured
cute player, but not one on scholarship.

125
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:07,042
- Since when do you care about lacrosse?
- Since I needed to get away from N.Y.U.

126
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,556
Everyone's planning
their living arrangements for next year.

127
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:10,804
It's so depressing.

128
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,890
Your friends didn't ask you
to live with them?

129
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:16,695
In a postwar building on a street
that's not even numbered. It's lettered.

130
00:07:17,205 --> 00:07:20,564
And its big selling point is
that it's above a falafel stand.

131
00:07:21,254 --> 00:07:22,486
I gotta go.

132
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:24,985
There's no V.I.P. Area,
but there's a nice set of bleachers.

133
00:07:28,863 --> 00:07:31,825
You probably don't remember us,
but we met at your mom's fashion show.

134
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:34,564
Yeah, of course.

135
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:38,739
Hair band girl.
I never forget a good accessory.

136
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:39,958
We're celebrating.

137
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,497
We just got
the most amazing apartment ever.

138
00:07:42,622 --> 00:07:44,755
You would totally approve, prewar,

139
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,425
doorman, and the best part, Fauchon

140
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,009
is opening up next door.

141
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,178
Can I ask you something?

142
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:54,223
What do you think about falafel?

143
00:07:55,452 --> 00:07:57,059
That's the food paralegals eat.

144
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,022
I never thought I'd see Blair Waldorf
on the Upper West Side.

145
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,024
Unless... Oh, my God.

146
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,858
Are you transferring to Columbia?

147
00:08:06,431 --> 00:08:07,427
I hope so.

148
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:08,946
N.Y.U. is so beneath you.

149
00:08:15,205 --> 00:08:16,139
It's true!

150
00:08:16,836 --> 00:08:18,330
I'm a Columbia girl now.

151
00:08:20,611 --> 00:08:21,708
As you should be.

152
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:29,466
The last time I was at a ceremony
in my honor, I slaughtered a chicken.

153
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,852
At least you've been honored.
I've never been honored,

154
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:34,396
I did win a contest once
at boarding school,

155
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:36,071
and I think there was a plaque,

156
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,081
but I'm not sure that really counts.

157
00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:39,936
What kind of contest?

158
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,691
- Drinking hot chocolate at the fair.
- I had a buddy

159
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,901
that went to Exeter, and his stories
would make Keith Richards blush.

160
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:51,280
I wasn't really
into the party scene.

161
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,449
I was there more for the academics.

162
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,242
Sounds like
you've made great choices.

163
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,211
I'm glad.

164
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,840
The bad ones have a way of...

165
00:08:58,194 --> 00:08:59,246
following you.

166
00:09:01,505 --> 00:09:03,307
I've never heard
that hot chocolate story.

167
00:09:03,432 --> 00:09:05,419
There're a lot you haven't heard.

168
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:07,379
True, but I did hear this one.

169
00:09:07,928 --> 00:09:10,466
My ex-boyfriend went
to boarding school with Serena,

170
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:13,260
and he tells a great one about
her and this teacher one night

171
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,095
at a bed-and-breakfast.

172
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,936
Although I'm sure
they were studying.

173
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:19,516
Like she says,
she was all about the academics.

174
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,770
I have an announcement.

175
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:26,982
I'm moving back in.

176
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,984
That way,
I can be here with you, mom.

177
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:32,112
And it'll just be really great
to be back in my old room again.

178
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:34,823
Don't worry, Jenny.
We'll find a place for you.

179
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:37,782
That's great, because

180
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,077
I'm moving in, too.

181
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,578
Downstairs.

182
00:09:41,703 --> 00:09:44,374
I was waiting to tell you until
the board approved my sublet tomorrow.

183
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,044
But I'm very excited.

184
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,255
All my family
together under one roof again.

185
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,056
<i>Better watch out, Humphreys.</i>

186
00:09:52,181 --> 00:09:54,218
<i>They say love makes a family,</i>

187
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:55,886
<i>but on the Upper East Side,</i>

188
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,099
<i>everyone knows</i>

189
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,388
<i>it's real estate.</i>

190
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,670
Dad, I'm sorry I'm running so late.

191
00:10:08,795 --> 00:10:10,400
- Can you save me a waffle?
- <i>Always.</i>

192
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,518
I'll put one in the oven for you.

193
00:10:13,064 --> 00:10:14,064
<i>How's Lily?</i>

194
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:15,439
- She's great.
- <i>And you?</i>

195
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:17,247
How you holding up?
It must be weird.

196
00:10:17,372 --> 00:10:18,992
Lily's ex-husband is now her doctor.

197
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,371
It was at first. But the fact is, he's
her doctor now. I'm her husband.

198
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,935
By the way, Vanessa can't make it.
Said she had to be somewhere.

199
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,251
Oh, right. The internship at CNN.

200
00:10:27,558 --> 00:10:29,982
<i>They called me as one of
the references she listed.</i>

201
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:31,718
Yeah, I wouldn't know.

202
00:10:31,843 --> 00:10:34,567
We are keeping our creative lives
separate right now.

203
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:36,842
You might wanna discuss this one,

204
00:10:37,535 --> 00:10:40,432
Since it involves her going
to Haiti for three months.

205
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:46,131
You know what, dad? I think I'm gonna
have to cancel that waffle.

206
00:10:46,256 --> 00:10:48,256
- Okay.
- All right. See you.

207
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:05,173
I know this gala tomorrow night
seems boring, but I thought,

208
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:08,295
if there's a girl you like,
perhaps you'd like to invite her.

209
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,169
Actually, I'm gay.
So if I was going, which I'm not,

210
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,937
then my date would be
a guy named Elliot.

211
00:11:15,161 --> 00:11:17,592
That's cool.
Bring Elliot.

212
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,434
- I'd love to meet him.
- Please stop...

213
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:22,699
acting like you and I have
any kind of relationship.

214
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,960
You're right.

215
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,636
- I have a lot to make up for.
- I'm sorry.

216
00:11:37,232 --> 00:11:40,098
The window for that closed somewhere
between my 12th birthday

217
00:11:40,223 --> 00:11:42,743
and, my suicide attempt.

218
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,122
Don't worry. I'm fine now.

219
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:51,146
Going through without a father
made me realize that I don't need one.

220
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:58,141
I understand that I've lost the right
To be a father to you, but...

221
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:02,629
If there's any way that
we can get to know each other...

222
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,200
On your terms...

223
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,841
Serena may want
a relationship with you,

224
00:12:13,974 --> 00:12:15,275
But I don't.

225
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:29,956
Serena, stop it! You can't do that.

226
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,835
The room was on loan I'm taking it back.
I don't care if I leave it in the closet

227
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,200
- Borrowing without asking is stealing.
- Dad, tell her to stop!

228
00:12:37,325 --> 00:12:40,126
I think it's great you're moving back in
but tha's Jenny's room now.

229
00:12:40,251 --> 00:12:41,949
You can stay in Chuck's old room.

230
00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:44,096
No way. That room is haunted
by Chuck's depravity.

231
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,182
Jenny can take it. I'm sure
it wouldn't bother you.

232
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:50,310
Okay, what's going on with you two?

233
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:52,521
Nothing.

234
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,774
Fine. Whatever.
Serena can have her old room back.

235
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,526
That's ridiculous. I'll have Laryssa
make up Chuck's bed for you.

236
00:12:58,651 --> 00:13:00,294
I'm confident
that there's no depravity

237
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:02,421
that brand-new E.Braun sheets
can't erase.

238
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,224
How many problems does J. have to cause
before you realize she's the problem?

239
00:13:14,355 --> 00:13:16,416
Thanks for meeting me here.
The library started...

240
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,691
Did you apply for a documentary
internship in Haiti?

241
00:13:20,117 --> 00:13:21,758
Yeah.
The producer just called.

242
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,802
I got the job.

243
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,160
When were you planning
on telling me about this?

244
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:31,141
This morning, then you put it on the
"do not discuss" list and I panicked.

245
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:33,747
Why? This is not about
competing for something.

246
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:35,272
This is about our relationship.

247
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,687
But both of those have been
so tied up in each other,

248
00:13:37,812 --> 00:13:39,508
and this job is a huge deal for me.

249
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:42,597
But you can't pretend like you going
away for 3 months isn't gonna affect us.

250
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,165
I think I didn't wanna face that.

251
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,527
It was so much easier when we're friends
and we could talk about things.

252
00:13:47,652 --> 00:13:49,704
All right,
is that what you want, then?

253
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,029
You wanna go back to just friends?

254
00:13:56,023 --> 00:13:57,252
I don't know.

255
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,345
Anyway, Serena might be
a little upset.

256
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,108
Well, you were right.
She can stay in Charles' room.

257
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:13,497
- It's getting crowded around here.
- No kidding.

258
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:17,104
Throw in your ex-husband,
and now we're a Nancy Meyers movie.

259
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:19,191
I hope you don't mind.
I know it's awkward.

260
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,327
Well, I mean, it is a little
unusual, don't you think,

261
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:25,902
for a doctor to move in
to his patient's building?

262
00:14:26,027 --> 00:14:29,327
Well, not if he's the father
of the patient's children.

263
00:14:30,758 --> 00:14:32,458
What are you getting at?

264
00:14:33,364 --> 00:14:34,964
Is it possible that...

265
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:38,276
Will's also trying
to get close to you?

266
00:14:39,288 --> 00:14:40,504
Absolutely not.

267
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:43,479
I'm the one that told William
to stay away if he couldn't make good

268
00:14:43,604 --> 00:14:45,717
on the promises he made
to the children.

269
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,969
And I'm sorry if this is
uncomfortable for you.

270
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,348
But if William wants to move in
to be closer to the kids,

271
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,566
I'm not gonna stand in his way.

272
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,350
Holland? Hi, it's Rufus.

273
00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:22,091
I have a favor to ask.

274
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:26,345
And the social scene
at N.Y.U. Was criminal.

275
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,474
Ten freshmen, a keg and a tub of hummus
on a card table isn't a party.

276
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:31,876
It's a tragedy.

277
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:37,143
Blair Waldorf just got a text.

278
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,563
It's like watching lady gaga
set fire to a piano!

279
00:15:43,313 --> 00:15:44,715
- Who's it from?
- Serena.

280
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,070
Apparently, Jenny
is claiming squatter's rights

281
00:15:47,195 --> 00:15:48,680
on her old room.
It's disgusting.

282
00:15:48,805 --> 00:15:51,408
Oh, my God. Jenny can't do that
to Serena van Der Woodsen.

283
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,526
So what's the plan of attack?

284
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,430
It's between Serena and Jenny.

285
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,996
Anyway, I've had some recent bad luck
getting involved in real estate disputes

286
00:16:00,121 --> 00:16:02,853
So I was thinking
Warren-Tricomi mani/pedis?

287
00:16:02,978 --> 00:16:05,088
I told you. It doesn't matter
if she transfers.

288
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,975
Blair Waldorf was over the minute
she became a student at N.Y.U.

289
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,099
Are you third personing me?

290
00:16:11,224 --> 00:16:13,680
- I third person people, not you!
- Exactly.

291
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:17,251
You're Blair Waldorf,
fashion icon, Queen B.

292
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,437
And probably the future
President of the United States.

293
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:22,355
Or Chanel.

294
00:16:22,617 --> 00:16:24,970
Jenny Humphrey just kicked
Serena van Der Woodsen

295
00:16:25,095 --> 00:16:27,477
out of her room, and you're
not gonna do anything?

296
00:16:27,602 --> 00:16:30,780
I would. I just don't have
any dirt on Jenny right now.

297
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,407
Ahem. I do.

298
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:36,263
Jenny and her boyfriend sold Adderall
to my boyfriend a couple of months ago.

299
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:37,988
Lose the judge-face, Zoe.

300
00:16:38,113 --> 00:16:40,874
He took a very heavy course load
this semester.

301
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:43,622
Jenny Humphrey, drug dealer.

302
00:16:46,065 --> 00:16:47,274
I can work with that.

303
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,799
<i>We hear Blair Waldorf's
headed for a comeback.</i>

304
00:16:50,404 --> 00:16:53,053
<i>But if she wants
to keep her fans happy...</i>

305
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:53,997
Send.

306
00:16:54,122 --> 00:16:56,056
<i>She better keep serving up the hits.</i>

307
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,766
- Sleep well?
- Don't even.

308
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:08,093
I can't believe you posted
on "Gossip Girl" that I'm a drug dealer.

309
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:09,883
I didn't post anything.

310
00:17:10,008 --> 00:17:13,537
Fine. Maybe you didn't send the e-mail,
but I know Blair do your dirty work.

311
00:17:13,662 --> 00:17:14,991
I can't help what Blair does.

312
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,516
And you are the one

313
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:19,591
who played Pablo Escobar
to underage preppy pill poppers.

314
00:17:19,716 --> 00:17:23,625
My dad and I were finally in a good
place after a really, really bad patch.

315
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,907
And if he finds this out,
it'll destroy everything.

316
00:17:26,032 --> 00:17:28,618
Maybe Rufus should know
that his daughter is dealing drugs.

317
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:32,747
You thought my father should know
all my adventures at boarding school.

318
00:17:34,046 --> 00:17:37,356
Fine. Maybe I shouldn't
have said anything,

319
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:39,187
But you shouldn't
be lying to your dad.

320
00:17:39,312 --> 00:17:42,148
Are you really lecturing me
about lying to a parent?

321
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:43,436
My dad knows who I am,

322
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,189
but you're building a relationship
with yours that's a complete lie.

323
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,504
I can't believe that you are
willing to destroy

324
00:17:48,629 --> 00:17:50,452
My relationship with my father

325
00:17:50,577 --> 00:17:54,581
because you're too scared that yours
won't love you for who you really are.

326
00:18:10,565 --> 00:18:13,091
You were right. We need to make
these decisions together.

327
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,158
But the truth is, consulting with
someone else doesn't come easily to me.

328
00:18:16,283 --> 00:18:18,059
I get it, Vanessa.

329
00:18:18,718 --> 00:18:21,418
- I totally support you going.
- Thank you,

330
00:18:21,778 --> 00:18:23,908
but I'm not taking the internship.

331
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:26,552
I'd rather lose the job
than lose you.

332
00:18:26,677 --> 00:18:29,050
You're not gonna lose me
if you go to Haiti.

333
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,924
We're gonna find
a way to make this work.

334
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:32,068
But you gotta go.

335
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,262
I don't want to, and we both know it's
better for our relationship if I stayed.

336
00:18:35,387 --> 00:18:37,937
I mean, three months
is too long, and...

337
00:18:39,228 --> 00:18:40,978
I just wanna be with you.

338
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,820
Are you sure?

339
00:18:45,105 --> 00:18:46,791
You're making this decision for you?

340
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:50,035
Not me?
Not even us?

341
00:18:55,127 --> 00:18:57,373
All right. Okay.

342
00:18:57,498 --> 00:19:00,427
Let's find a way to celebrate tonight,
then-a fun way. We could...

343
00:19:00,552 --> 00:19:02,743
Let's see. You want to sneak 40s
into the midnight showing

344
00:19:02,868 --> 00:19:04,601
of <i>the lost weekend</i> at film forum?

345
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,811
I'm supposed to have drinks
with the woman from CNN,

346
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,512
and I owe it to her to tell her
my decision face to face.

347
00:19:09,637 --> 00:19:11,691
Okay. All right.
Well, tomorrow night, then.

348
00:19:12,195 --> 00:19:13,245
Absolutely.

349
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,733
You never made it
to my lacrosse game yesterday.

350
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:55,979
What are you doing?

351
00:19:56,374 --> 00:19:59,948
I could ask you the same. Does Serena
know you're trying to pull off plaid?

352
00:20:00,334 --> 00:20:04,160
Seriously, I expected Chuck to go back
to his old habits after your breakup,

353
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,266
But I'd actually thought
you'd grown up a little.

354
00:20:06,391 --> 00:20:07,570
Whatever do you mean?

355
00:20:07,695 --> 00:20:10,208
Blair Waldorf on the upper West Side
two days in a row?

356
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,627
It looks like you're pretending
to be a Columbia student,

357
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,505
<i>and not that I care much about what
Jenny Humphrey does these days,</i>

358
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,528
But I saw that smackdown
on "Gossip Girl".

359
00:20:17,653 --> 00:20:20,343
She was dealing drugs.
It's called an intervention.

360
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,217
It's called you going back
to plotting and conniving,

361
00:20:23,342 --> 00:20:25,482
Okay, and that's
the Waldorf equivalent of Chuck

362
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:27,985
going around, sleeping
with every call girl in the city

363
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,810
and avoiding any kind
of emotional contact.

364
00:20:33,378 --> 00:20:36,526
Okay. So I'm pretending
to be a student here.

365
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,444
<i>But it's because
I'm living a nightmare.</i>

366
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,812
I'm trapped at N.Y.U.,
and it's too late to transfer.

367
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:45,848
So what's wrong with cheering
myself up with a little denial

368
00:20:45,973 --> 00:20:48,246
- and a "Gossip Girl" blast or two?
- Nothing, I guess,

369
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:52,314
but you can always make it right
with whoever you take down online.

370
00:20:52,715 --> 00:20:56,254
And who knows if Chuck's even gonna
have time to do that with Lily or not?

371
00:21:20,811 --> 00:21:22,113
Morning, sunshine.

372
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,201
I've got the Dom 95, your favorite.

373
00:21:25,802 --> 00:21:26,826
No, thank you.

374
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,828
And I much prefer Roederer nowadays.

375
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,915
Oh, I apologize. Nadine left
behind some of her intimates.

376
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,125
She must have wanted
an excuse to come back.

377
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,226
Or maybe she just left in a hurry.

378
00:21:36,351 --> 00:21:38,519
If you're here to mock me,
I'm not in the mood...

379
00:21:38,644 --> 00:21:41,344
Unless you have
some punishment in mind.

380
00:21:43,025 --> 00:21:45,637
We've broken up, Chuck,
and frankly, I don't care what you do.

381
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,473
But I can't sit by
and just watch you avoid Lily.

382
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,475
I'm actually quite busy with work.

383
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,643
Well, you had time for Nadine.

384
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,305
Trust me, she was work.

385
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,492
And I promise you,
Lily is not sitting around,

386
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:59,046
wondering when she's going
to hear from Chuck bass.

387
00:21:59,171 --> 00:22:00,902
Justify not seeing Lily
all you want.

388
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,220
You and I both know what this is.

389
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:04,614
You've lost Bart,

390
00:22:05,244 --> 00:22:08,451
Elizabeth betrayed you, and the thought
of losing Lily terrifies you.

391
00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:10,789
Please.

392
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:15,041
Spare me your N.Y.U.
freshman psych analysis.

393
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,915
Perhaps if you were at an Ivy,

394
00:22:19,735 --> 00:22:21,535
You'd have better insight.

395
00:22:26,076 --> 00:22:29,931
<i>Spotted: B claiming
to be a co-ed at Columbia,</i>

396
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:33,303
<i>When everyone knows
she's a zero at N.Y.U.</i>

397
00:22:33,428 --> 00:22:34,533
<i>Poor B.</i>

398
00:22:34,658 --> 00:22:37,563
<i>First she lost Chuck
and now her dignity.</i>

399
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,024
- "Gossip Girl" blast?
- No, it's nothing.

400
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:43,861
Look, Chuck, sleep with every
Nadine in town for all I care,

401
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,533
but don't close your heart to Lily.

402
00:22:45,658 --> 00:22:47,196
You and I both know that in the end,

403
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:49,789
The person you'll end up
hurting the most is you.

404
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:01,549
Amalia, it's Blair.

405
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,972
Are you still waiting on me
to sign the lease?

406
00:23:05,097 --> 00:23:08,439
Well, tell the girls it's a yes.
I'll take the apartment.

407
00:23:08,564 --> 00:23:11,114
<i>You make your bed, you lie in it, B.</i>

408
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:13,766
<i>Too bad yours is in
the East village.</i>

409
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:22,350
Were you able to convince
your brother to come tonight?

410
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:24,193
No. And please
don't act like you care.

411
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,362
I'm sorry? I just got
off the phone with my dad.

412
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,084
Someone didn't want him in the building,
so they gave him a bad recommendation,

413
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:33,009
and it worked.
The board didn't approve him.

414
00:23:33,508 --> 00:23:35,308
You're behind this, right?

415
00:23:37,014 --> 00:23:38,504
- I am.
- How could you do that?

416
00:23:38,629 --> 00:23:41,586
I don't expect you to understand, but
I felt it was the right thing to do.

417
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:45,173
I know you and my father used to hate
each other but that was a long time ago.

418
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,535
You are the only one
still having this fight.

419
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,761
- He has moved on.
- Is everything okay?

420
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,167
Rufus went to the board and blocked
dad for the apartment.

421
00:23:52,292 --> 00:23:54,716
That's absurd. Rufus would never
do something like that.

422
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:56,677
I would, to protect my marriage.

423
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,562
I don't trust William's intention, and
I don't want him living under my roof.

424
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,439
Rufus, you're being
completely paranoid.

425
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,822
At first he tried he tried to
isolate you from your family,

426
00:24:03,947 --> 00:24:06,055
and now he's moving to the building
closer to you.

427
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,780
I told you, he's moving in
to be close to the children.

428
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,074
All I see here is jealousy run amok.

429
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:13,326
Mom, come on. We should go.

430
00:24:14,608 --> 00:24:17,163
It's probably best
if you don't come tonight.

431
00:24:41,735 --> 00:24:44,440
- What are you two doing here?
- This is an alumni event.

432
00:24:44,565 --> 00:24:46,676
Columbia puts aside a bunch
of tickets for students.

433
00:24:46,801 --> 00:24:49,320
We'd invite you to join,
but they were very explicit.

434
00:24:49,727 --> 00:24:51,477
No fake students allowed.

436
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:13,553
If you'll excuse me a moment, I should
go say hello to a few old colleagues.

437
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,597
- I'll be right back.
- Don't rush.

438
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:41,870
Do I want to know what you had
to promise him to get him to come?

439
00:25:41,995 --> 00:25:43,166
No, it wasn't me.

440
00:25:47,355 --> 00:25:51,112
It's not he even listens to me, and he
probably ran out of girls to have sex.

441
00:25:51,237 --> 00:25:54,253
I... want to apologize.

442
00:25:55,433 --> 00:25:56,971
My absence has been inexcusable.

443
00:25:58,443 --> 00:26:01,211
Well, I know my situation brings
up a lot of issues for you.

444
00:26:01,336 --> 00:26:03,912
You've had to deal
with so much loss.

445
00:26:04,037 --> 00:26:05,887
But I'm not gonna lose you.

446
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,041
I'm here for you,

447
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:11,815
Every step of the way.

448
00:26:15,603 --> 00:26:19,032
You look good, Lily. In fact, you look
better than good. You look great.

449
00:26:20,317 --> 00:26:22,163
Thank you. I feel great.

450
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:24,456
So you had better be prepared

451
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,972
for a lifetime of family brunches,

452
00:26:27,097 --> 00:26:29,670
because I'm not going anywhere.

453
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,270
Okay.

454
00:26:57,251 --> 00:26:59,521
I bailed on the Columbia gala.
I was kind of in the mood

455
00:26:59,646 --> 00:27:02,519
for watching a pretentious movie
I don't understand with you and Vanessa.

456
00:27:02,644 --> 00:27:05,244
No Vanessa, but pretentious movie?
Check.

457
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:10,405
Not that I'm not thrilled to expose you
to the joys of Russian cinema,

458
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:14,530
but does this visit have anything
to do with the "Gossip Girl" blast?

459
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,350
Is it true?

460
00:27:20,213 --> 00:27:21,513
Are you dealing?

461
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,936
I was,
When I was dating Damien, yeah.

462
00:27:27,797 --> 00:27:30,940
- But, no, not anymore.
- This could so easily get back to dad.

463
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,264
I think it'd be better if
he heard it from you.

464
00:27:33,389 --> 00:27:34,453
Are you insane?

465
00:27:34,578 --> 00:27:37,558
I mean, you and I both know
that's a suicide mission.

466
00:27:37,683 --> 00:27:38,683
Look...

467
00:27:39,593 --> 00:27:42,311
If you want him to have
faith in you, Jenny,

468
00:27:42,436 --> 00:27:44,750
maybe you need to have
a little faith in him.

469
00:27:50,072 --> 00:27:52,126
Yeah, all right.
I'll go see if I can

470
00:27:52,251 --> 00:27:55,256
dig out a dress from my old closet.
Maybe I can catch him at the gala.

471
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,852
You know, big crowd,
lots of witnesses.

472
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,740
Is everything okay
with you and Vanessa?

473
00:28:06,865 --> 00:28:09,165
Yeah, well, at least I think it is.

474
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,745
It's been hard to say lately.

475
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:13,316
Maybe you need to have
a little faith, too.

476
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,236
- It's great to see you again.
- You, too.

477
00:28:20,361 --> 00:28:22,826
- What a pleasure. Good to see you.
- Good to see you, Bob.

478
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,207
Dad, do you have a second?

479
00:28:25,332 --> 00:28:27,259
I want to talk to you
about something.

480
00:28:27,384 --> 00:28:28,734
Sure. Please sit.

481
00:28:33,644 --> 00:28:36,894
You know, the contest that I won
at boarding school...

482
00:28:39,236 --> 00:28:41,844
It was for drinking...
Absinthe.

483
00:28:42,202 --> 00:28:45,848
And that was probably
one of my tamer nights.

484
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:49,959
The truth is I've had
a pretty wild past,

485
00:28:50,084 --> 00:28:53,561
and I've been a part
of more than one scandal.

486
00:28:53,686 --> 00:28:56,108
Serena, I don't care
about any of that.

487
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:03,359
I know.
I guess I was just...

488
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:07,129
Scared that...
Once mom gets better,

489
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:11,735
You may not wanna stick around
if you knew the real me.

490
00:29:16,203 --> 00:29:18,003
Honey, I want nothing more

491
00:29:18,704 --> 00:29:21,559
than to be a part
of all of your lives again.

492
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:27,371
I'm trying to figure out
how big a role I can play

493
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:30,263
without stepping on anybody's toes.

494
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,147
You know, I love Rufus...

495
00:29:37,263 --> 00:29:40,057
But you're my dad.
He's not.

496
00:29:40,182 --> 00:29:41,416
<i>Aw, Serena finally</i>

497
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,320
<i>has the perfect
relationship with her daddy.</i>

498
00:29:44,445 --> 00:29:48,077
<i>But will her dream come true
be Rufus' worst nightmare?</i>

499
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:58,434
Oh, of course. The theme
of this evening seems to be torture.

500
00:29:59,194 --> 00:30:01,372
You're not a fan of
university galas?

501
00:30:01,497 --> 00:30:04,642
Quite the opposite.
I'm in my natural habitat.

502
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:07,221
It's torture
because it's at Columbia.

503
00:30:07,654 --> 00:30:11,225
And by some cruel Twist of fate,
I go to N.Y.U.

504
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:14,058
It's like being locked out of Lanvin
on the day they get fall in.

505
00:30:14,183 --> 00:30:17,069
Sorry, I don't mean to ramble on.
I'm Blair Waldorf.

506
00:30:17,194 --> 00:30:18,862
Wait. I know that name.

507
00:30:18,987 --> 00:30:21,277
- You read "Gossip Girl"?
- No, I read college applications.

508
00:30:21,593 --> 00:30:23,452
I work in the admissions office
at Columbia.

509
00:30:23,577 --> 00:30:26,377
I was just looking
at your application today.

510
00:30:26,755 --> 00:30:27,755
I'm sorry?

511
00:30:28,508 --> 00:30:30,911
It's not our policy to do this,

512
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,374
but e-mails go out tomorrow,
and you're standing right here,

513
00:30:35,863 --> 00:30:37,334
welcome to Columbia.

514
00:30:51,506 --> 00:30:52,900
Champagne, please.

515
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,937
Are you okay?
You got crazy eyes.

516
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,316
I think I just became
a Columbia student... for real.

517
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,818
It doesn't make any sense.
I never applied.

518
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,328
Oh, my God.

519
00:31:04,453 --> 00:31:06,320
I cannot believe he actually did it.

520
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,325
Months ago, Chuck joked
about applying for you.

521
00:31:10,064 --> 00:31:12,870
He said you had too much pride
to admit N.Y.U. was a mistake.

522
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:19,543
Looks like he actually did
something right for once.

523
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:22,180
Congratulations.

524
00:31:26,463 --> 00:31:27,235
Thanks.

525
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:43,116
You're not at the gala?

526
00:31:43,241 --> 00:31:45,319
I thought it'd be best
for everybody if I didn't go.

527
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,279
I see my father
is still working his magic.

528
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:51,238
- It's not all him.
- Yes, it is.

529
00:31:52,097 --> 00:31:53,790
It's just that no one else sees it.

530
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,248
You make my mom happier than
all of her ex-husbands combined.

531
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,282
It should be you with her tonight,
not some guy who disappeared.

532
00:32:02,563 --> 00:32:03,796
I am already in the tux.

533
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,804
- Elliot, what are you doing here?
- Your father invited me?

534
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,789
He said he didn't think
you had plans tonight.

535
00:32:14,914 --> 00:32:15,808
Not me.

536
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,685
I hope it's okay.

537
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,814
It's okay to be mad at him,

538
00:32:23,764 --> 00:32:25,818
but it's okay to let him try
to make it right, too.

539
00:32:30,901 --> 00:32:33,367
All right. I'm heading out.
Wish me luck.

540
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,370
You don't need it.
You're the only one for her.

541
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,734
<i>After Dr. Van Der Woodsen organized</i>

542
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:49,425
<i>the response
to the polio outbreak in India,</i>

543
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,266
he moved on to Somalia,

544
00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:53,971
where he served
as a field coordinator in Huddur.

545
00:32:54,968 --> 00:32:58,266
While there, he oversaw everything
from shrapnel wounds

546
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,603
- to cancer to chronic illness.
- Rufus.

547
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:04,356
- I'm surprised to see you here.
- Holland, if you'll excuse me,

548
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,799
I'll catch up with you later.
I need to talk to Lily.

549
00:33:10,092 --> 00:33:12,090
- What're you doing here?
- I'm sorry about today.

550
00:33:12,215 --> 00:33:13,852
I don't want Will
to come between us.

551
00:33:15,397 --> 00:33:17,363
I don't give a damn who lives where.

552
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,622
I just want to be with you.

553
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:29,263
<i>He has done all of this while
continuing to build his reputation</i>

554
00:33:29,388 --> 00:33:31,134
<i>as a leader in the progressive</i>

555
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,483
<i>treatments of cancer.</i>

556
00:33:32,608 --> 00:33:34,365
Lily looks amazing, doesn't she?

557
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,097
Being sick hasn't
slowed her down at all.

558
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,767
She is the picture of health.

559
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,560
<i>Invaluable member of our team.</i>

560
00:33:41,984 --> 00:33:43,312
Ladies and gentlemen,

561
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,573
Dr. William Van Der Woodsen.

562
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,788
Thank you, Dean. Thank you.

563
00:34:09,036 --> 00:34:10,467
I had another speech prepared

564
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:11,806
for you this evening,

565
00:34:12,082 --> 00:34:14,592
but my beautiful daughter Serena

566
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:15,699
came to me,

567
00:34:15,824 --> 00:34:16,943
and she was so

568
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,431
honest and brave,

569
00:34:19,788 --> 00:34:22,066
that it made me realize that...

570
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,895
I need to be honest, too.

571
00:34:26,015 --> 00:34:29,274
I made many personal sacrifices
to be a doctor,

572
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:33,570
but I never quite realized
until now that...

573
00:34:35,353 --> 00:34:37,307
the greatest sacrifice of all

574
00:34:37,907 --> 00:34:38,992
was my family.

575
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,644
So the most important thing

576
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:44,623
that I can say here tonight
is not to all of you,

577
00:34:45,392 --> 00:34:47,376
but to them.

578
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:51,935
I made the biggest mistake
of my life walking out on you,

579
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:54,385
and I promise to do everything

580
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:55,509
in my power

581
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,929
to make it up to you,
to make it right again,

582
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:01,640
because I love you.

583
00:35:05,185 --> 00:35:06,061
<i>My, oh, my.</i>

584
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,480
<i>Did Dr. Van Der Woodsen</i>

585
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,441
<i>just make a public pass
at Rufus' wife?</i>

586
00:35:11,262 --> 00:35:14,987
<i>Looks like this Doctor Without
Borders needs a few boundaries.</i>

587
00:35:26,163 --> 00:35:27,750
I guess you
were right about William,

588
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:29,752
but it doesn't matter
how he feels about me,

589
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,514
because I don't love him.

590
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:32,754
I love you, Rufus.

591
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:35,758
I know you're comfortable
with him, Lil, but I'm not.

592
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:37,491
I need you to find another doctor.

593
00:35:37,616 --> 00:35:40,637
I understand why you don't trust him,
but surely, you trust me.

594
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,975
I don't want to fight
with you, Rufus.

595
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,009
We'll put it aside till tomorrow.
Let's get you home.

596
00:35:48,644 --> 00:35:49,702
You know what?

597
00:35:49,827 --> 00:35:52,929
Right now, more than anything,
I just need a quiet night, alone.

598
00:35:55,614 --> 00:35:56,867
Please, just for tonight,

599
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,948
I need you to sleep at the loft.

600
00:36:09,855 --> 00:36:11,087
Jenny Humphrey.

601
00:36:12,071 --> 00:36:14,463
You bitch. You told me
you were selling me oxy,

602
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,476
but those pills were antibiotics.

603
00:36:16,601 --> 00:36:18,550
Yeah, I didn't get high.
I got a yeast infection.

604
00:36:29,308 --> 00:36:30,976
I can explain.
I came here to tell you.

605
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:32,606
Please save your breath.

606
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,608
Like I'm gonna believe you.

607
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:37,444
Get your things and come with me.
We're going home... to Brooklyn.

608
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,169
What did you want to talk about?

609
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,186
The producer from CNN
just flew into town,

610
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:58,882
- and I'm gonna meet her in 20 minutes.
- Take the internship.

611
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,537
I don't want us to be making decisions
based on fear.

612
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,514
All right?
So whatever happens,

613
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:07,095
we'll figure it out.

614
00:37:11,242 --> 00:37:12,104
Thank you.

615
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:22,449
I got you some stationery
so we can write letters to each other

616
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,575
- while you're away.
- That is so romantic.

617
00:37:25,093 --> 00:37:26,869
Maybe if we become
famous writers one day,

618
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:29,064
they'll publish 'em after we die.

619
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,948
Maybe, but don't let that stop you
from writing some of the dirty stuff.

620
00:37:32,073 --> 00:37:33,208
Just a little bit.

621
00:37:41,935 --> 00:37:43,218
I'm gonna miss you so much.

622
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,558
Not if you don't go.

623
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:52,487
You don't want to be late to meet
your new boss. Get out of here.

624
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:06,731
Thank you.

625
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:10,245
- Hey, Holland.
- Hey. Have you seen your mother?

626
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,901
No. I think she left.

627
00:38:13,485 --> 00:38:14,630
Is everything okay?

628
00:38:18,647 --> 00:38:22,257
If Dr. Van Der Woodsen loves your mother
as much as he said he did in the speech,

629
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,844
then there's something
she should know about Rufus.

630
00:38:26,735 --> 00:38:30,456
<i>Listen carefully, S.
Holland has a tale to tell.</i>

631
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,935
<i>Apparently, her upstairs neighbor</i>

632
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,311
<i>has been coming downstairs.</i>

633
00:38:42,843 --> 00:38:44,404
Serena, I thought you left.

634
00:38:47,704 --> 00:38:48,874
Is everything okay?

635
00:38:49,347 --> 00:38:50,717
Not really, no.

636
00:38:52,877 --> 00:38:54,470
I heard
what you said in your speech,

637
00:38:54,831 --> 00:38:56,792
if you want to fight
for mom, then do it.

638
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,781
I think you girls
got some misinformation.

639
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,847
I will be attending Columbia
in the fall.

640
00:39:32,258 --> 00:39:33,287
That's awesome.

641
00:39:34,885 --> 00:39:36,832
We have an extra room
in the apartment.

642
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,085
- Maybe you wanna move in with us?
- No. I don't live with the help.

643
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:43,213
And you wanted to see
a Blair Waldorf takedown?

644
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,762
Cross me again,

645
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:47,175
and you'll experience one firsthand.

647
00:40:03,884 --> 00:40:05,319
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, it's Jenny.</i>

648
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:07,179
I want to talk to you about Lily.

649
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:10,282
Obviously, I'm not a doctor,

650
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,993
and it's kind of a long story
how I know this,

651
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,162
but there's something weird
about her medicine.

652
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,569
Elliot's the perfect mix
of smart and fun.

653
00:40:22,466 --> 00:40:25,678
He speaks three languages, but he has
a subscription to "People" magazine.

654
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,468
I invited dad over
for some hot chocolate.

655
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:31,275
I hope that's okay.

656
00:40:35,521 --> 00:40:37,836
- If it's a bad idea, I can...
- No, it's okay.

657
00:40:44,345 --> 00:40:45,484
William, join us.

658
00:40:58,347 --> 00:40:59,498
Rufus. It's Serena.

659
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:02,863
Is your mom there?

660
00:41:04,258 --> 00:41:07,380
Yeah, she's here.
She's just really tired right now.

661
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,983
<i>I'll let her know you called.</i>

662
00:41:11,701 --> 00:41:15,373
<i>They say that family are the people
who will always take you in.</i>

663
00:41:16,357 --> 00:41:18,715
<i>But what if instead,
they shut the door?</i>

664
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,636
I was just telling mom
about my date with Elliot.

665
00:41:23,209 --> 00:41:24,940
We had a great time.
Thank you.

666
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,402
- Who was that?
- It was just Blair.

667
00:41:29,562 --> 00:41:30,545
<i>Or even worse,</i>

668
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,970
<i>let someone else take your place?</i>

669
00:41:36,224 --> 00:41:39,092
<i>What do you say, Serena?
