00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:07,965
I can't have you spending time
with someone messed up with drugs.

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,344
Everyone'll be happy to know
that Damien and I broke up.

5
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,095
You touch this dress,
you'll never set foot in here again.

6
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:17,094
- You should do your own clothing line.
- I can model them. You can do this.

7
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:18,893
I didn't know you'd be such a thief.

8
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,354
Agnes, give me my dresses!
What are you doing?!

9
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,732
Hiding these feelings is killing me,
'cause I want totell how happy I am.

10
00:00:25,214 --> 00:00:27,151
I think you should tell people.

11
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,654
I want to be as much a part
of your life as you'll let me.

12
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:31,281
I need someone to take over

13
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,849
operations of my hotel.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,867
other people who'd do a better job.

15
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,410
They aren't my mother.

16
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,788
- Do we have ourselves a hotel?
- We do.

26

So, where are we going? I thought
everyone was coming over for brunch.

27
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:14,289
It's the first
since you're back at Lily's.

28
00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:15,953
As hard as it is for me to admit,

29
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:17,993
some things are more important
than waffles.

30
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:20,538
And you're not gonna another day
sulking in that apartment.

31
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:23,718
- You grounded me.
- And I won't be able to unground you

32
00:01:23,843 --> 00:01:26,684
until I know you're okay.
That's why we're going to Eleanor's.

33
00:01:26,809 --> 00:01:28,689
- Wait. What?
- I was talking to Serena,

34
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:32,191
and she said that Eleanor is having
something called a pop-up fashion show

35
00:01:32,316 --> 00:01:33,678
for her new junior line.

36
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:35,650
So I asked her
if you could help out.

37
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:37,388
Dad, the last time I worked for her,

38
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:39,627
it didn't exactly end well.
Remember?

39
00:01:39,752 --> 00:01:42,643
But I also remember that my daughter
used to love working in fashion.

40
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,485
Listen, just give it a shot.

41
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,340
Your room's not going anywhere.

42
00:02:04,018 --> 00:02:05,999
This isn't so bad, is it?

43
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:09,957
Thanks, dad.

44
00:02:11,644 --> 00:02:13,674
I'll see you at home tonight,
after the show.

45
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,167
There's something about waking
up on the day of a fashion show.

46
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:26,228
The smell of fresh pleats
wafting through the city...

47
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,911
Nothing quickens your blood
quite like couture.

48
00:02:29,145 --> 00:02:31,921
Ride with me uptown? My mother
would love to see you for breakfast.

49
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:34,653
I have a breakfast with my mother.

50
00:02:35,247 --> 00:02:37,615
I'm so proud of you for
opening up to Elizabeth.

51
00:02:37,987 --> 00:02:40,555
She earned my trust, and I, hers.

52
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,537
And she seems to be faring well
at the helm of the mighty empire?

53
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,062
She's a natural.

54
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:46,880
Have a perfect day.

55
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:53,839
Nothing says luxury quite
like your own private army.

56
00:02:56,171 --> 00:02:57,802
Victor, is everything all right?

57
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,958
Mr. Bass, you need

58
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,099
to vacate the premises...
immediately.

59
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,031
I think you've misunderstood.

60
00:03:07,638 --> 00:03:09,788
I may have put my mother in
charge for the time being,

61
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:11,690
but I'm not leaving the hotel.

62
00:03:12,248 --> 00:03:14,634
Actually, sir,
these orders come from her.

63
00:03:18,758 --> 00:03:21,075
My, look who's risen from the dead.

64
00:03:21,621 --> 00:03:24,252
I just wanted to say thank you
so much for this opportunity.

65
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:27,581
And I've learned a lot
since the last time we worked together,

66
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,584
and I won't let you down.

67
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,669
Well, despite our troubled past,

68
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:35,047
as I told your father,
I am a firm believer in second chances,

69
00:03:35,346 --> 00:03:38,416
so I even rehired your friend.

70
00:03:44,163 --> 00:03:45,558
Hi. How are you?

71
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:48,519
90 days sober in A.A.

72
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,296
Good for you. Now come on.

73
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,668
What are you waiting for?
Get Agnes fitted.

74
00:03:55,446 --> 00:03:57,338
I like to see my elves busy.

75
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,788
Clock's tickin'.

76
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:08,101
You ready? 'Cause this is it.

77
00:04:09,894 --> 00:04:11,956
I'm ready. It's time.

78
00:04:14,783 --> 00:04:17,431
We're just gonna go in
and tell them we're dating.

79
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:19,481
Exactly. It's no big.

80
00:04:19,941 --> 00:04:21,468
Hey! It's the lovebirds.

81
00:04:28,788 --> 00:04:29,982
He told you, didn't he?

82
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,750
She can read my mind.

83
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,577
Come on.
You couldn't wait to tell.

84
00:04:33,702 --> 00:04:36,066
Speaking for everyone else,
I think it's great.

85
00:04:36,524 --> 00:04:38,527
Now that the happy couple
is here, let's go eat.

86
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:40,267
Come on.

87
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:47,328
I have some very exciting news.

88
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,027
Mr. Conwell is flying in

89
00:04:50,152 --> 00:04:52,823
from Salt Lake City
to see the show tonight.

90
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:55,294
Mr. Conwell?

91
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:59,068
He is the C.E.O.
of Conwell's department stores.

92
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:03,673
Blair, it's the biggest
retailer in the entire country,

93
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:07,014
and my first choice to
carry the new junior line.

94
00:05:07,553 --> 00:05:09,475
What about Barneys or Saks

95
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,615
or Bloomingdale's?

96
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,521
No, my dear,
high-end has fallen on hard times.

97
00:05:16,124 --> 00:05:19,459
Mr. Conwell can put my line in over

98
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,654
5,000 retail locations.

99
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:24,163
Where Bristol Palin shops?

100
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:27,281
Feed the masses.
Eat with the classes.

101
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:29,494
Although you do raise
a very good point.

102
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,049
My usual crowd of uptown socialites
and boho fashionistas

103
00:05:33,174 --> 00:05:36,859
might give Mr. Conwell
the wrong message.

104
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,333
We need to surround him

105
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,854
with wholesome American girls-

106
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:45,465
the kind of girl
that he wants to shop at Conwell's.

107
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,350
I just had the most inspired idea.

108
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,279
Dessert at Momofuku after the show?

109
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,708
You should invite
all of your college girlfriends

110
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,144
to see the show tonight.

111
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:57,290
Mother, it's very last minute.

112
00:05:57,778 --> 00:06:00,807
Miss Blair keep girls
on busy schedule.

113
00:06:00,932 --> 00:06:03,308
Must beat drum, she says.

114
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:08,404
Baby beat dorota's stomach
like Lars from Metallica.

115
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:13,141
I need a gaggle of pink
sheet college freshmen.

116
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:16,583
Just bring 10 or 20,
no more than 30.

117
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:22,131
Tell them how important it is to you,
to me. I need Mr. Conwell to say yes.

118
00:06:27,037 --> 00:06:29,248
But, miss Blair,
you have no friends.

119
00:06:29,373 --> 00:06:32,599
Even N.Y.U.
minions very second-rate.

120
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:34,233
Actually...

121
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:37,938
There is one person at N.Y.U.
Who could help.

122
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,614
Did you send security
to kick me out?

123
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,410
Just listen. I- no.

124
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,284
Let me.

125
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:52,619
Morning, nephew.

126
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,289
What is this leech doing
stuck to my hotel?

127
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,529
Your hotel?

128
00:06:56,654 --> 00:06:58,181
This is Elizabeth's hotel.

129
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,128
You're just a guest who's
no longer welcome here.

130
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,673
I'm sorry, Chuck.
You need to leave.

131
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,675
What? Wait.

132
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,886
What the hell is going on here?

133
00:07:09,243 --> 00:07:10,593
Isn't it obvious?

134
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:15,100
You've been played, Chucky,
from the very beginning.

135
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:17,371
Now...

136
00:07:17,496 --> 00:07:19,063
It's check-out time,

137
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,273
and we need to get your room ready

138
00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:23,635
for, well, me.

139
00:07:30,778 --> 00:07:31,825
Stop.

140
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:40,311
<i>We hear Chuck's hotel is hanging
on by a thread...</i>

141
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:45,621
<i>And Jack's pulling all the strings.</i>

142
00:07:53,577 --> 00:07:56,149
Vanessa, I'm seriously
so happy for you guys.

143
00:07:56,274 --> 00:07:58,219
Thanks. It's been really great.

144
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,924
It's been so easy to be with Dan,

145
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:02,064
knowing someone your whole life,
like you and Nate.

146
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,732
Yeah, it definitely
has its advantages.

147
00:08:04,857 --> 00:08:06,735
When you've known someone so long,

148
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,957
you know, you're just
more comfortable. Nate and I

149
00:08:09,082 --> 00:08:11,332
have no problem trying new things.

150
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,950
Not like that.

151
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,798
Just keeping the romance
and mystery alive.

152
00:08:15,923 --> 00:08:17,890
You don't ever want
to fall into a rut.

153
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:19,338
I'm sure you and Dan...

154
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,031
Yeah, we always try new things.

155
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:25,129
So since you guys are out of hiding,

156
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,648
what are your plans tonight?

157
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,519
You should come
to Eleanor's fashion show.

158
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:31,018
Oh, no. Actually, we're gonna be
doing dinner at the loft.

159
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:35,139
- Vanessa's cooking up some,
- private dinner, Hmm? Sounds romantic.

160
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:36,723
No, it's not like that.

161
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,871
We're just, you know, watching movies,
cooking up some noodles.

162
00:08:39,996 --> 00:08:42,938
Uh, it's kind of become
our Saturday tradition.

163
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:52,197
Agnes, can you put
your arms down, please?

164
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,532
Both arms.

165
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,499
Look, Agnes, I'm sorry for
how everything went down.

166
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,666
I shouldn't have gone behind your back
and cut you out of the fashion line.

167
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,131
I was gonna quit anyway.
Those dresses were lame.

168
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,383
Agnes, I'm trying to apologize.

169
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,428
You trusted me, believed in me,
and I betrayed you.

170
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:17,374
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

171
00:09:20,704 --> 00:09:23,004
I'm sorry for torching your dresses.

172
00:09:23,484 --> 00:09:25,689
Truth is, they were amazing.

173
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,816
Over it?

174
00:09:28,657 --> 00:09:30,110
I missed you, bitch.

175
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:38,744
What is it?

176
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,079
Nothing.

177
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:45,241
Ugh. Well...

178
00:09:45,966 --> 00:09:48,232
Truth is I was dating
this guy named Damien,

179
00:09:48,357 --> 00:09:51,465
and he was a lot of things,
one of them being a dealer.

180
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,101
The sid to your Nancy.

181
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:55,802
That's awesome. What happened?

182
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,305
Well, when I didn't want to, uh...

183
00:09:58,903 --> 00:10:00,057
Whatever with him,

184
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:04,102
he bailed. Now he just keeps
texting me for his stupid pills.

185
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,730
Sweetie, you can't let
him treat you like that.

186
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,820
I know, but whatever. Spin.

187
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:16,664
Hey, Damien?

188
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:18,946
- It's Jenny's friend Agnes.
- What are you doing?

189
00:10:19,071 --> 00:10:21,358
Yeah, she wanted me to
call you to set up a swap.

190
00:10:21,483 --> 00:10:24,083
We were thinking the
Waldorf pop-up show?

191
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,216
- Love it. Kiss.
- Agnes.

192
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:31,255
What? Chill out.
This is your payback, okay?

193
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,585
He's gonna show up tonight.
You're gonna wave the baggy

194
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,276
in front of his face and then
flush it down the toilet.

195
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:39,471
No one gets hurt, and you
get to show him who's boss.

196
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:42,933
Gotta take back your pride, babe.

197
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:47,312
All right. I'll admit that's
actually kind of brilliant.

198
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,314
We're total bitches.

199
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,697
I want to do something
special for Dan tonight.

200
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:59,965
Vanessa, I'm sorry.
I hope I didn't make you feel...

201
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,661
No, not at all. You were right.
Noodles and movies?

202
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,375
I mean, I just don't
want it to feel like

203
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,499
his one-millionth dinner
with the same girl he's

204
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,252
- known his whole life.
- Two words: role-play.

205
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:15,632
You know, that's-
that's not a terrible idea.

206
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,510
Why don't you do a date night
inspired by one of his favorite films?

207
00:11:19,302 --> 00:11:21,040
He would definitely
not be expecting that.

208
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:23,063
So, I'll see
you at the loft at 6:00?

209
00:11:23,188 --> 00:11:24,266
6:30 maybe.

210
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:26,549
Okay.

211
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:32,391
- Oh, my God.
- What's wrong?

212
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:34,693
We have to find Chuck.

213
00:11:40,385 --> 00:11:41,627
You hate it?

214
00:11:43,856 --> 00:11:46,288
I had forgotten how
talented you are.

215
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:49,775
I want to close with this.

216
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,835
And after the show is over,

217
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,938
you and I need to have a
talk about finding you

218
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:56,548
a more permanent position
with Waldorf designs.

219
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,676
Yeah. Wow. Eleanor,
thank you so much.

220
00:12:00,591 --> 00:12:01,595
Yeah.

221
00:12:05,288 --> 00:12:07,434
Treats were in your dresser,
just like you said.

222
00:12:08,717 --> 00:12:10,817
Grabbed this clutch to hide 'em.

223
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:13,382
The eagle has landed.

224
00:12:13,507 --> 00:12:15,150
Thank you, kali.

225
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,281
I'm sorry, Agnes...

226
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,367
I don't think I wanna go
through with this.

227
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,161
It's just that it's the
first time in weeks

228
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,814
that I've been able to
not think about Damien

229
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:31,666
and the first time in even longer
that I've actually been happy.

230
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:34,127
I don't know I forgot
how much I love this,

231
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,880
and I don't want to do anything
to mess it up, you know?

232
00:12:37,641 --> 00:12:39,615
I'll just text Damien and, uh,

233
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,334
- tell him to forget it, okay?
- It's okay. I get it.

234
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:46,209
I was just trying to
help out an old friend.

235
00:12:49,911 --> 00:12:51,144
Are you okay?

236
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,319
What's going on?

237
00:12:52,444 --> 00:12:55,045
It would appear
we've all been players

238
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,672
in a Jack bass plot.

239
00:12:56,797 --> 00:12:59,597
The reappearance of my mother,
the lawsuit...

240
00:13:00,317 --> 00:13:02,817
it's all been part
of an elaborate ruse

241
00:13:03,277 --> 00:13:05,951
to get me to sign over
my hotel to Elizabeth.

242
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,978
You have to admire his handiwork.

243
00:13:08,103 --> 00:13:10,455
Have you spoken to your lawyers?
There's gotta be a way.

244
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:12,958
It turns out my lawyer was in on it.

245
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,627
Regardless, a suit to regain
control would take months,

246
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,255
in which time Jack would
have bankrupted the hotel,

247
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,258
making it easy pickings for
whatever vultures he has lined up.

248
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:24,052
My only hope is to talk
to Elizabeth alone,

249
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,863
convince her to sign the
hotel back over to me.

250
00:13:26,988 --> 00:13:29,266
What makes you think
she's gonna do that?

251
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,935
This isn't her idea.
Jack has something on her.

252
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:35,230
I just need to figure out what.
I'll call you.

253
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:46,264
And all this time, we thought
Chuck got his dark side from his father.

254
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:49,828
- Maybe his mother's the evil.
- If she is his mother.

255
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,831
The story Elizabeth told me,
how do we even know it's true?

256
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,515
Chuck did a d.N.A. Test.
It was his guy at the N.Y.P.D.

257
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,378
But he probably
sent it out to a lab.

258
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,797
I wouldn't put it past
Jack Bass to fake it.

259
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,371
Whatever the truth is,
Chuck isn't ready to hear it.

260
00:14:03,496 --> 00:14:06,094
In the meantime, I have to
get ready for a fashion show.

261
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,847
It's in 2 hours,
and I have 30 friends coming.

262
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,392
What? What friends?

263
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:23,320
Excuse me. Miss brandeis?
Can I help you?

264
00:14:23,714 --> 00:14:24,764
I'm dorota.

265
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:28,072
Miss Blair would like to know,

266
00:14:30,893 --> 00:14:32,537
what is your hourly

267
00:14:33,454 --> 00:14:36,283
and if you have any friends,
like, 30?

268
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:37,834
30?

269
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,428
Jenny, can you help me get
these racks downstairs?

270
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,097
- Don't worry. I can watch your stuff.
- Thanks. Okay.

271
00:14:59,117 --> 00:15:01,903
<i>Careful, J.
The show's about to start,</i>

272
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:04,095
<i>and it looks like Eleanor's line</i>

273
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,541
<i>is going to bring a whole
new meaning to high fashion.</i>

274
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,654
Like taking candy from a baby.

275
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,132
Helen, thank you so much for coming.

276
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,445
Storey, you look adorable.

277
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,309
B., I know what Chuck said,

278
00:15:29,434 --> 00:15:31,450
- but shouldn't we...
- Do nothing.

279
00:15:31,575 --> 00:15:33,723
He says he wants to handle
it on his own. We let him.

280
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:36,476
You don't think it's killing me?

281
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,107
- Oh, my God. Brandeis is here.
- Finally.

282
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,494
- Serena.
- Brandeis.

283
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,571
How's Congressman Wade?

284
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:51,199
- He's polling very well these days.
- Okay, so there's your target...

285
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,435
The guy over there talking
to my mom, Ed Conwell.

286
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,028
And remember, you guys
are my BFFs from NYU, so...

287
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:57,330
We got it, Blair.

288
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,040
We're closed for businessmen.

289
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:08,842
What? My mother said she wanted me

290
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,094
to pack the crowd with
wholesome American girls.

291
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,054
So you hired escorts?

292
00:16:14,704 --> 00:16:17,225
B., you couldn't just tell your mom
you don't have friends at NYU?

293
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,255
Prostitutes are people, too,

294
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,813
and they have a lot
of disposable income.

295
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:58,975
Who are you?

296
00:16:59,454 --> 00:17:01,019
Good evening, Daniel.

297
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,398
Hungry?

298
00:17:09,322 --> 00:17:11,613
This is, this is just like...

299
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,239
"Rear window." I know.

300
00:17:27,144 --> 00:17:28,181
Come on, people.

301
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:30,470
Trish, the girls look great.
Are they ready?

302
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,680
Show's in five minutes.
Agnes, where did you get that?

303
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:39,078
What? It's not like you're
gonna do anything with it.

304
00:17:39,203 --> 00:17:40,433
It's just a little party.

305
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:43,395
What about your 90 days?

306
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,488
Look, I need the
waldorfs of the world

307
00:17:45,613 --> 00:17:47,982
to think that I'm working a
program so I can get hired.

308
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,657
I'm not gonna let you risk ruining

309
00:17:49,782 --> 00:17:51,569
- the entire show.
- What are you gonna do?

310
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,615
Waltz up to Eleanor and tell her that
your drug dealer dumped your virgin ass

311
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,159
and now the rest of her
models are high on his stash?

312
00:17:58,471 --> 00:18:00,662
I will tell Eleanor
exactly what happened.

313
00:18:01,506 --> 00:18:03,112
You know, this is my second chance.

314
00:18:03,237 --> 00:18:06,376
And you don'twant to change your life,
but I certainly want to change mine.

315
00:18:08,633 --> 00:18:09,987
I need to tell you something.

316
00:18:10,112 --> 00:18:12,777
Not now, Jenny.
The show is about to start.

317
00:18:12,902 --> 00:18:14,792
- Come on. Get the girls in line.
- But, I...

318
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:17,512
My goodness, getting models
to do anything, it's like herding cats.

319
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,847
Yes, but I really...

320
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,162
Jenny, go.

321
00:18:22,673 --> 00:18:25,771
You know, I think it's time
for little J. to say good night.

322
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,067
I thought you wanted to
wait till the after party.

323
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,784
No. Let's put her to bed early.

324
00:18:41,031 --> 00:18:42,808
I thought I was being
taken to the empire.

325
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:45,725
Elias and a few other
employees are still loyal.

326
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:51,493
I don't know how much my
Uncle has promised you,

327
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:54,054
but I'll double it if you
give me my hotel back.

328
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:57,340
Chuck, this was never about money.

329
00:18:57,465 --> 00:18:59,277
Then what does Jack have on you?

330
00:18:59,402 --> 00:19:01,514
'Cause it must be something
for you to do all this.

331
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:02,967
I love him.

332
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:06,644
I know it's very difficult
for you to understand...

333
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,562
Jack isn't capable of love.
He is using you.

334
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,332
He is stealing my hotel and
then he will leave you.

335
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,603
I know he's not perfect,

336
00:19:16,204 --> 00:19:17,837
but he understands me.

337
00:19:17,962 --> 00:19:19,407
He doesn't judge me.

338
00:19:20,003 --> 00:19:22,842
Underneath it all,
he's a kind, loving person.

339
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:25,658
What kind of loving person

340
00:19:25,783 --> 00:19:27,874
would convince you to do this to me?

341
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,746
When we started the game,
I told myself...

342
00:19:35,135 --> 00:19:37,135
That you were just a stranger.

343
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,178
But I didn't know how much
I'd come to care for you.

344
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,679
So help me.

345
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,766
Give me back my hotel.

346
00:19:46,192 --> 00:19:47,192
I can't.

347
00:19:48,862 --> 00:19:51,079
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry? That's it?

348
00:19:51,204 --> 00:19:52,304
I need Jack.

349
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:56,186
And I believe he needs me, too.

350
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:58,103
He... he loves me.

351
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:01,238
If you believe that...

352
00:20:03,948 --> 00:20:06,621
Then you deserve
whatever happens next.

353
00:20:26,205 --> 00:20:28,835
Wow. I didn't realize Blair
had so many friends at NYU.

354
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,110
Yeah. Though at $300 an hour,
they don't come cheap.

355
00:20:36,345 --> 00:20:37,902
Oh, it's Chuck. Hey.

356
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,737
I couldn't get through to Elizabeth.

357
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,072
What happened?

358
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:43,756
She thinks she loves Jack.
<i>It's over.</i>

359
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,578
The empire's gone.

360
00:20:47,168 --> 00:20:48,980
<i>I don't know. Um,
what do you say, Brandeis?</i>

361
00:20:49,105 --> 00:20:50,915
<i>About five minutes? Uh, yeah.
Five minutes. </i>

362
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,633
Maybe not. Hey, can you get Jack
to Eleanor's fashion show?

363
00:20:58,322 --> 00:21:00,592
So? Uh, it was great.
It was great.

364
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,448
I'm not really a
shellfish kind of guy.

365
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:05,520
The little middle green
parts kinda, you know,

366
00:21:05,645 --> 00:21:07,557
but the wine was amazing.

367
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,594
- Montrachet, just like...
- What grace Kelly brought Jimmy Stewart

368
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:12,169
That's right, yeah.

369
00:21:12,294 --> 00:21:14,439
But a part of you wishes
we'd had ramen.

370
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:18,151
No. What? No seriously,
Vanessa, this was amazing.

371
00:21:18,732 --> 00:21:20,938
In fact, I got you
a little surprise.

372
00:21:21,063 --> 00:21:23,522
The student union is running
a mizoguchi marathon tonight.

373
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:25,582
That sounds amazing, but I thought

374
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,870
we'd do something different tonight,
break out of our rut.

375
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:29,834
Our rut?

376
00:21:31,016 --> 00:21:32,498
We just started dating.

377
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:35,126
What do we do now that we didn't do
when we were friends?

378
00:21:35,735 --> 00:21:37,310
Are you serious?

379
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,934
Obviously, besides that.

380
00:21:39,871 --> 00:21:42,800
Is this what that whole "good evening,
Daniel" bit over there was all about?

381
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,435
I was just trying to put
a little mystery in our relationship

382
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,085
but if you'd rather just

383
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,486
do the same old thing,

384
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,965
Sorry.
I was just gonna pick up my 12-string.

385
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,297
No, why don't you stay?

386
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,605
I made dessert.

387
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,472
No. This is clearly a date.

388
00:21:57,597 --> 00:22:00,063
You don't want it to be like
the nights the three of us hang out.

389
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:01,033
Really?

390
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,359
Because that sounds

391
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,905
exactly like what Dan wants.

392
00:22:09,822 --> 00:22:11,913
- What's going on?
- I'm not sure.

393
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:44,112
Don't you just love the line?

394
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,071
Everybody looks good in it,

395
00:22:46,196 --> 00:22:48,757
even the people
who shop in your store.

396
00:22:49,303 --> 00:22:50,923
The clothes speak for themselves,

397
00:22:51,048 --> 00:22:52,996
but, unfortunately,
our stores will never carry

398
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:55,466
your mother's line
if this is the type of clientele

399
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:57,288
that will be attracted to Conwell's.

400
00:22:57,413 --> 00:22:58,334
What?

401
00:22:58,762 --> 00:23:01,673
It attracts all kinds.
Everyone is here.

402
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,492
Yeah, I can see that.

403
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,261
Apparently...

404
00:23:06,705 --> 00:23:08,397
Even prostitutes.

405
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,958
Eleanor wanted to congratulate
you on a great show

406
00:23:49,226 --> 00:23:51,134
and say thanks
for all your hard work.

407
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,471
Thank you.

408
00:23:52,596 --> 00:23:55,335
Last year she congratulated me herself
with a toast.

409
00:23:55,878 --> 00:23:57,366
You deserve it.

410
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:01,841
<i>We hear Eleanor's show
brought down the house.</i>

411
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,430
Did you give her one or two?

412
00:24:04,891 --> 00:24:05,762
Three.

413
00:24:06,771 --> 00:24:08,538
<i>Sounds like a night to remember...</i>

414
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,281
<i>if you can.</i>

415
00:24:14,305 --> 00:24:15,912
What's the matter, J.?

416
00:24:16,351 --> 00:24:17,883
Champagne go to your head?

417
00:24:19,998 --> 00:24:21,812
Did you put something in my drink?

418
00:24:21,937 --> 00:24:24,234
Ever since I saw you at Eleanor's,

419
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:26,923
all I could think about
was payback for last year.

420
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:30,676
Then Damien's party favors just
happened to fall into my lap.

421
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,388
I wasn't gonna stand around

422
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,348
and watch Eleanor kiss your ass?

423
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:38,131
I was gonna have
my own fashion line.

424
00:24:38,256 --> 00:24:39,783
Things were gonna change for me.

425
00:24:39,908 --> 00:24:42,438
And then you had to go ahead
and do it all your way.

426
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,900
So here's to you, J.

427
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:46,994
Cheers.

428
00:24:51,084 --> 00:24:53,616
Nate, I heard my nephew's
ready to cry Uncle. Where is he?

429
00:24:54,478 --> 00:24:55,827
You can wait by the bar.

430
00:25:05,228 --> 00:25:07,088
Now we just need Jack to be Jack.

431
00:25:09,405 --> 00:25:11,724
Vanessa, this is fantastic.
I didn't realize you made flan.

432
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:13,386
I got the recipe off the Internet.

433
00:25:16,045 --> 00:25:17,849
Did you do something to your hair?

434
00:25:18,863 --> 00:25:19,934
Excuse me.

435
00:25:24,478 --> 00:25:25,857
Son, I have to tell you,

436
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,321
this date is a disaster.
What's going on?

437
00:25:28,446 --> 00:25:30,945
She thinksthat we're stuckin a rut.

438
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,530
A rut? You just started dating.

439
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,073
Yeah. I know.

440
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,658
You need to talk this through.

441
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:38,129
She's Vanessa. You're Dan.
You guys are best friends.

442
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,448
Did she just leave?

443
00:25:44,785 --> 00:25:46,415
You whore and a half.

444
00:25:46,841 --> 00:25:48,741
You couldn't just
keep it in your pants?

445
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,549
Conwell was about to buy
my mother's junior line until you-

446
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,465
Blair, I didn't cruise Mr. Conwell.

447
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,947
Then how does he know
you're a prostitute?

448
00:25:57,072 --> 00:25:59,682
He doesn't. He knows Julian is.

449
00:26:00,805 --> 00:26:02,582
He's supposed to see
him tonight, in fact.

450
00:26:02,707 --> 00:26:05,980
Julian and Conwell part
every time he flies into town.

451
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,899
I'm really sorry, Blair.

452
00:26:08,104 --> 00:26:11,485
We had no idea there'd be clients
here tonight. It was a total surprise.

453
00:26:11,662 --> 00:26:12,817
I bet it was.

454
00:26:17,891 --> 00:26:19,410
Brandeis, my apologies.

455
00:26:21,074 --> 00:26:22,205
I'll be right back.

456
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,653
Mr. Conwell, a moment!

457
00:26:28,973 --> 00:26:31,339
Your special friend, Julian,

458
00:26:31,896 --> 00:26:35,259
wanted you to know that he's running
a little late tonight.

459
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,722
Blair, I have a family.

460
00:26:40,014 --> 00:26:42,141
So do I, Mr. Conwell.

461
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,422
And when you love your family,

462
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:45,494
like we do,

463
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:48,606
you never want to see them
get hurt or disappointed.

464
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:54,403
What?

465
00:26:54,785 --> 00:26:57,567
You want to take another
look at my mother's line?

466
00:26:58,189 --> 00:26:59,700
Of course you can.

467
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:04,140
So we photograph Jack with a couple
of hookers and show it to Elizabeth?

468
00:27:04,265 --> 00:27:07,265
Yes, and then she signs
the empire back to Chuck.

469
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,126
Okay.

470
00:27:09,466 --> 00:27:11,216
You've only got one shot.

471
00:27:12,288 --> 00:27:13,288
Evening.

472
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,217
Serena. Nate.

473
00:27:17,351 --> 00:27:19,217
This is Jessica and Bethany.

474
00:27:19,342 --> 00:27:22,098
Were you hoping to catch me
in a compromising position?

475
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,518
A little High School,
don't you think?

476
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,770
Leave the plotting to the experts.

477
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,356
Bethany, what were you saying
about sustainable energy?

478
00:27:30,737 --> 00:27:33,387
- I'm gonna call Chuck.
- I'll find Blair.

479
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:40,886
Wait! Wait.

480
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:43,498
This little one's
not going home just yet,

481
00:27:43,623 --> 00:27:46,038
we're gonna go see if we
can get this girl laid.

482
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,665
Pile in, bitches.

483
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:52,218
<i>Spotted, little J.
passing out in a taxi.</i>

484
00:27:56,827 --> 00:28:00,075
<i>Looks like somebody
better call the fashion police.</i>

485
00:28:06,503 --> 00:28:09,156
Is this where the bachelor party is?

486
00:28:09,281 --> 00:28:11,988
- Yeah. You here to join us?
- Me? No.

487
00:28:12,113 --> 00:28:14,984
But, my friend here,
she's ready to party.

488
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:19,044
Make sure you guys
show her a good time.

489
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,117
Thank you, Amy.

490
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,371
This is my first review
for "teen vogue." I'm very excited.

491
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,457
Mother!

492
00:28:30,466 --> 00:28:31,516
Great news.

493
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,240
I just wanted to tell you
that Conwell's would be honored

494
00:28:37,365 --> 00:28:39,675
to call itself your
exclusive retailer.

495
00:28:39,977 --> 00:28:43,130
That is marvelous news,
isn't it, Blair?

496
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:44,324
Congratulations.

497
00:28:44,449 --> 00:28:47,738
Of course we need to
make a few alterations...

498
00:28:47,863 --> 00:28:50,811
hemlines, necklines.
You understand.

499
00:28:51,617 --> 00:28:53,481
We could certainly discuss it.
Is that all?

500
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,799
And we'd like to change the name.

501
00:28:56,287 --> 00:28:59,587
"Eleanor waldorf" sounds a
bit uppity and New York-ish.

502
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,823
Excuse me.

503
00:29:03,315 --> 00:29:06,489
For the last 28 years,
every piece of clothing I have sewn

504
00:29:06,614 --> 00:29:08,713
has carried the name
"Eleanor Waldorf."

505
00:29:08,838 --> 00:29:10,656
My clothes are me.

506
00:29:10,781 --> 00:29:12,531
My store is me.

507
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,961
Manhattan is an island
in more ways than one.

508
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,623
What works for you and yours
doesn't necessarily

509
00:29:18,748 --> 00:29:20,318
translate to me and mine.

510
00:29:20,443 --> 00:29:23,874
Mr. Conwell, I think you're
forgetting about something or someone.

511
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:26,363
Blair. I want to thank
you for your time,

512
00:29:26,488 --> 00:29:29,988
but I do not think I will be
doing business with Conwell's.

513
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,780
Enjoy your flight back to Salt Lake.

514
00:29:37,816 --> 00:29:40,458
Mother, what are you doing?
We could close this.

515
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:44,438
It was a stupid idea to begin with.
I don't know what I was thinking.

516
00:29:44,563 --> 00:29:47,413
I would rather lose the
deal than lose myself.

517
00:29:48,513 --> 00:29:51,705
Never hide who you are,
you remember that?

518
00:29:55,967 --> 00:29:57,837
Everyone at NYU hates me.

519
00:29:58,738 --> 00:30:01,438
- What?
- I have minions, of course, but...

520
00:30:03,036 --> 00:30:05,052
They're hardly even
worthy of the name.

521
00:30:05,734 --> 00:30:09,557
No, I don't understand. What about
all your friends from school?

522
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,475
They'll be anyone's friend...
For the night.

523
00:30:15,644 --> 00:30:17,287
I was scared to tell you about NYU,

524
00:30:17,412 --> 00:30:20,341
because I didn't want you
to be disappointed in me.

525
00:30:20,466 --> 00:30:22,969
I did everything to try and fit in,

526
00:30:23,094 --> 00:30:25,558
but I hate it there.

527
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:30,705
My girl.

528
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:35,152
One of the things that make
Waldorf women so special

529
00:30:35,277 --> 00:30:38,377
is that we don't fit in everywhere.

530
00:30:39,028 --> 00:30:41,077
But I don't feel like
I fit in anywhere.

531
00:30:41,202 --> 00:30:44,852
That's 'cause you haven't found
the right place yet. You will.

532
00:30:54,712 --> 00:30:56,312
One more round
and we're out of here.

533
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,190
Maybe I should stay and,
take care of blondie.

534
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:02,531
We'll tell the bartender
to call her a cab.

535
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,030
All right, first, shots!

536
00:31:09,797 --> 00:31:10,534
Hello?

537
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,652
Hey. Where are you?
I've been calling you for...

538
00:31:15,877 --> 00:31:17,166
I don't know where I am.

539
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:20,334
- <i>I feel sick.</i>
- Okay, Jenny, hold on one second.

540
00:31:25,176 --> 00:31:27,363
Listen, just stay put.

541
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,638
- All right, I'm coming to get you.
- Hurry, please.

542
00:31:42,379 --> 00:31:43,609
Can we talk?

543
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:49,424
So, uh,

544
00:31:49,981 --> 00:31:51,784
Look, what happened tonight?

545
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:55,746
Don't you worry that we do all the same
stuff we did when we were best friends?

546
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,366
We go to movies,
we play scrabble with Rufus,

547
00:31:58,491 --> 00:32:01,585
we go to coffee shops and make fun
of people. We are the exact same.

548
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,514
- Yeah, well, except...
- yes, I know. We have sex.

549
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:08,133
But I wanted to do something to say,
we're more than friends with benefits.

550
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:12,428
No, I was going to say except,
uh, it's not the same.

551
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:14,765
And if you give me a chance,

552
00:32:15,182 --> 00:32:18,872
I want to take you
on the most romantic second first date

553
00:32:19,665 --> 00:32:20,965
you've ever had.

554
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:24,942
Where?

555
00:32:25,504 --> 00:32:27,390
Well, that's a surprise.

556
00:32:33,832 --> 00:32:37,079
I hope you didn't bring me here
to gloat over your boyfriend's loyalty.

557
00:32:37,728 --> 00:32:39,806
Chuck, I called you because...

558
00:32:39,931 --> 00:32:43,131
This afternoon, I didn't
have the courage to tell you

559
00:32:43,557 --> 00:32:45,796
that I... I signed the
hotel over to Jack.

560
00:32:46,354 --> 00:32:49,395
Seeing you made me
realize what I'd done,

561
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,052
and so then I told him
he had to make a choice,

562
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:53,821
me or the hotel.

563
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:56,348
And what did my uncle say?

564
00:32:57,671 --> 00:32:59,810
My flight to Zurich leaves at 10:00.

565
00:33:00,828 --> 00:33:02,578
I wanted to say good-bye.

566
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:04,669
I'm sorry.

567
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,650
I tried.

568
00:33:11,436 --> 00:33:12,436
Stay...

569
00:33:13,763 --> 00:33:16,213
Not for Jack or the hotel.

570
00:33:18,612 --> 00:33:19,712
Stay for me.

571
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:24,666
I already lost my mother once.

572
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,706
I'm...

573
00:33:33,122 --> 00:33:34,219
not your mother.

574
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:38,641
I don't know if your real
mother is alive or not,

575
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:41,656
but I'm sure she loved you very much

576
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,571
and that she's nothing like me.

577
00:33:47,771 --> 00:33:48,921
You're right.

578
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:55,115
Because my real mother could never
have done to me what you did.

579
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,481
Andy better be calling
that chick a cab, man.

580
00:34:09,606 --> 00:34:11,542
That girl looked about 12.

581
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,569
Hey. Where is she?

582
00:34:16,475 --> 00:34:19,390
Want to get out of here?
I live real close. Come on.

583
00:34:20,009 --> 00:34:22,412
Where's Nate?
Is Nate your boyfriend?

584
00:34:22,537 --> 00:34:24,774
'Cause he really
shouldn't have left you.

585
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,830
No, I don't...

586
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,901
- Who the hell are you?
- Get off her.

587
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:34,405
- I was helping her.
- Yeah, sure you were.

588
00:34:35,044 --> 00:34:38,307
<i>It seems chivalry
isn't dead after all.</i>

589
00:34:38,432 --> 00:34:42,883
<i>Lucky for this damsel in a dress,
some things never go out of fashion.</i>

590
00:34:45,768 --> 00:34:46,959
How you feeling?

591
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:50,300
Steadier. How do I look?
I don't want to worry my dad.

592
00:34:50,425 --> 00:34:53,402
Yeah, play the exhausted card, okay?

593
00:34:53,527 --> 00:34:55,551
Hey. How was the show?

594
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,606
I thought you'd be
back a little sooner.

595
00:34:58,731 --> 00:35:01,932
Yeah. Sorry I'm late.
The show was great, though.

596
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,734
Yeah, there were no cabs,
so I just figured I'd walk her back.

597
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,309
Yeah. I'm so tired.

598
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:10,914
I'm just gonna crash. But thank you
so much, dad. I love you.

599
00:35:14,085 --> 00:35:16,280
- Thanks for seeing her home.
- Oh, yeah.

600
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,178
Good night.

601
00:35:25,053 --> 00:35:27,353
So I finally told my mom about NYU.

602
00:35:27,742 --> 00:35:30,227
B., I'm very proud of you for
telling your mother the truth.

603
00:35:30,352 --> 00:35:32,428
Why? What good does
the truth ever do?

604
00:35:32,553 --> 00:35:34,452
My mother can't help
me make friends.

605
00:35:34,577 --> 00:35:37,425
Excuse me.
Aren't you Blair Waldorf?

606
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,657
Yes. Sorry to bother you.

607
00:35:40,782 --> 00:35:43,686
But we're freshmen at
Columbia and, well...

608
00:35:43,811 --> 00:35:45,601
We thought you were dead.

609
00:35:46,148 --> 00:35:48,916
We haven't read about you
on "Gossip Girl" in forever.

610
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:51,346
What? You read "Gossip Girl"?

611
00:35:51,471 --> 00:35:53,525
Of course. Everyone
at Columbia does.

612
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,730
I love your louboutins.

613
00:36:00,415 --> 00:36:01,415
But...

614
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,329
The bow goes on the right.

615
00:36:06,772 --> 00:36:08,685
Thank you. Bye.

616
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:17,366
S., what do you know about Columbia?

617
00:36:18,795 --> 00:36:20,645
Hey, you forgot your purse.

618
00:36:29,683 --> 00:36:30,683
You okay?

619
00:36:33,252 --> 00:36:34,802
What's wrong with me?

620
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:39,198
Nothing is wrong with you.

621
00:36:42,372 --> 00:36:44,201
What are you talking about?

622
00:36:47,276 --> 00:36:49,176
Like, how did I end up here?

623
00:36:51,598 --> 00:36:52,876
Jenny, look at me.

624
00:36:54,136 --> 00:36:55,295
Okay, things...

625
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,371
Haven't exactly been
so easy for me either.

626
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:00,932
Now...

627
00:37:01,937 --> 00:37:04,378
I'm with Serena, and I'm so happy.

628
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,472
Things will turn
around for you, too.

629
00:37:11,992 --> 00:37:13,814
What if you're wrong, Nate?

630
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,816
What if everything we just-

631
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:26,361
It's Eleanor.

632
00:37:27,765 --> 00:37:30,257
"Great job today. You're hired.

633
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:32,207
Lunch tomorrow."

634
00:37:36,072 --> 00:37:37,180
See?

635
00:37:37,738 --> 00:37:39,629
And I hope
you learn from this, okay,

636
00:37:39,754 --> 00:37:41,546
mostly that I'm always right.

637
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,526
Oh, God, Nate,
thank you so much for tonight.

638
00:37:47,651 --> 00:37:49,184
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

639
00:37:51,558 --> 00:37:52,766
You're welcome.

640
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,306
Here. Try the bryndza.
Come on, swap.

641
00:38:03,431 --> 00:38:05,011
The cabbage is my second favorite.

642
00:38:05,136 --> 00:38:06,945
So this was your big romantic date,

643
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,063
having pierogies delivered
to my dorm room?

644
00:38:09,401 --> 00:38:11,825
- Tell me you're not having fun.
- I am, but this isn't a date.

645
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,443
- This is what we always do.
- Except now we get to do this.

646
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:23,016
And it'sbeing friends with benefits.

647
00:38:23,141 --> 00:38:26,178
No. No, because for me,

648
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:29,320
the benefit is that even though
we're doing the same things

649
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:32,217
eating pierogies and going to see <i>Ugetsu</i>
for the sixth time-

650
00:38:32,342 --> 00:38:35,938
- We've only seen it four times.
- Well, now...

651
00:38:36,412 --> 00:38:39,288
I get to do them with
you as my girlfriend,

652
00:38:40,258 --> 00:38:42,113
which is why just
sitting here with you

653
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:44,147
is the most romantic
date I can imagine.

654
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:49,781
Humphrey, you just earned
yourself some extra benefits.

655
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,446
<i>If you are what you wear,</i>

656
00:38:57,571 --> 00:38:59,606
<i>you better dress the part you want.</i>

657
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,541
<i>A few lucky ladies can do no wrong.</i>

658
00:39:03,939 --> 00:39:05,634
<i>Their look's perfection,</i>

659
00:39:06,586 --> 00:39:08,699
<i>and they've got
accessories to match.</i>

660
00:39:14,678 --> 00:39:15,598
<i>But most girls</i>

661
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,574
<i>get tired of the same old look,</i>

662
00:39:18,207 --> 00:39:19,652
<i>and they'll do</i>

663
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,234
<i>about anything to get
the hot new piece on their arm.</i>

664
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:30,128
<i>And then there are
those with no vision of their own-</i>

665
00:39:30,474 --> 00:39:33,578
<i>thieves of fashion
who'll steal the shirt off your back.</i>

666
00:39:42,524 --> 00:39:44,172
Did you change your mind?

667
00:39:44,956 --> 00:39:47,009
I was hoping you changed yours.

668
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,177
<i>Perhaps you need to see
the view from up here.</i>

669
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,179
People really do look like ants.

670
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,850
How did I ever love you?

671
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:56,160
Fair question.

672
00:39:57,592 --> 00:39:59,771
But if love won't tempt you,
how about money?

673
00:40:00,225 --> 00:40:01,469
I'm leaving,

674
00:40:02,096 --> 00:40:03,733
and I don't want anything.

675
00:40:04,714 --> 00:40:06,059
<i>Where are you gonna go?</i>

676
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,823
You destroyed your
relationship with your son.

677
00:40:11,115 --> 00:40:12,547
<i>Who else do you have besides me?</i>

678
00:40:13,877 --> 00:40:16,018
I told Chuck I wasn't his mother

679
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,288
and that he deserves
someone better than me.

680
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,753
I'll warn you you're taking off just
when it's about to get fun.

681
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,301
I'm starting over.

682
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:27,301
I'm going to try to be
the person I forgot.

683
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:30,653
<i>And always remember,</i>

684
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,531
<i>appearances can be deceiving.</i>

685
00:40:38,527 --> 00:40:39,640
Let's go.

686
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:58,727
Are you okay?

687
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,750
What happened?

688
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:01,890
Elizabeth?

689
00:41:02,015 --> 00:41:03,794
Is dead to me.

690
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,466
She's gone.

691
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:09,508
- And the hotel?
- Lost.

692
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:11,927
What?

693
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,093
Sorry?

694
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:15,995
Don't be.

695
00:41:16,929 --> 00:41:17,974
I'm not.

696
00:41:19,201 --> 00:41:22,479
I've come this far without my mother.
I'm not backing down now.

697
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:24,979
Well...

698
00:41:26,448 --> 00:41:29,528
If it's a war Jack wants,
then it's a war he'll get.
