We have to see this through
to the end.

4
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,467
This is the end, Chuck.

5
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:13,012
- You're applying to the Tisch program?
- I'm kinda not telling anyone.

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,848
That doesn't give you the right
to tell me who I can and can't see.

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,892
With Carter, yes, it does.

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,992
My P.I. just called me
about your dad.

9
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:22,355
He knows where he is,
just a 3-hour plane ride away.

10
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,023
<i>Do you know where Nate is?</i>

11
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,775
No, I don't see him right now.

12
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,486
If you find him, can you tell him
to call me back as soon as he can?

13
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:29,904
Serena left with Carter.

14
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,572
<i>Cece. Hi, it's Rufus.</i>

15
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,436
I don't know where you and Lily are,
but I know it's not Canyon Ranch.

16
00:00:35,561 --> 00:00:37,116

Oh, god. Waffles.

You don't like waffles?

26
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:06,869
It's not a matter of like.

27
00:01:06,994 --> 00:01:08,275
I'm a Humphrey,

28
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,834
so syrup is a food group.

29
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:12,672
Yeah, how are you not,
like, 500 pounds?

30
00:01:12,797 --> 00:01:14,097
Nice shirt, by the way.

31
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:17,576
Yeah, sorry.
It looked really comfy to sleep in.

32
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,692
Yeah, it's Serena's favorite
as well.

33
00:01:20,966 --> 00:01:22,707
So you still haven't heard from her?

34
00:01:25,036 --> 00:01:27,253
Radio silence
since she left with Carter.

35
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,381
I'm not gonna be the first one
to call her, you know?

36
00:01:32,037 --> 00:01:35,604
Thanks for letting me crash here.
I'm sorry you had to sleep on the couch.

37
00:01:36,373 --> 00:01:38,597
I have no idea how it got so late.

38
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,519
Time flies when you're having
a Wii tennis death match, Humphrey.

39
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:43,102
Did you call your dad?

40
00:01:43,674 --> 00:01:46,188
Yeah, but I said
that I was staying at Sawyer's,

41
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,811
so if anyone asks,

42
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:51,110
you're an insecure brunette Who has
an unnatural love for designer handbags.

43
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,198
Are we still on
for the Tim Burton exhibit at MoMA?

44
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,116
Yes.

45
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,328
It's Serena.

46
00:02:01,883 --> 00:02:04,061
<i>Just landed. So sorry.
Call you when I'm home.</i>

47
00:02:05,865 --> 00:02:08,280
You know what?
I'm gonna shower and just go over there.

48
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,624
Are you sure? I mean, she said
she was gonna call you.

49
00:02:11,749 --> 00:02:13,280
You don't wanna push, right?

50
00:02:13,405 --> 00:02:15,468
Yeah, if we talk,
it should be in person.

51
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,679
- Rain check on MoMA?
- Sure.

52
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,411
You ready?

53
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,710
To explain to Rufus the real reason
I've been lying to him?

54
00:02:38,211 --> 00:02:41,242
- But I know I have to.
- It's Rufus. He'll understand.

55
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:42,703
Let's hope.

56
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,754
It's hard enough to tell him,
but now with your father involved-

57
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,917
William and Rufus
do not exactly get along.

58
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,711
Nothing like
a grunge-era love triangle.

59
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:56,092
Yes, complete
with an unplanned pregnancy,

60
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,762
atrip to a french sanatorium,

61
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,263
my mother and a whole lot of flannel.
It was ugly in more ways than one.

62
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:05,811
It'll be okay, mom.
I'm here for you.

63
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:18,989
It's a lot easier to sneak up on someone
when you're not eight months pregnant

64
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,704
and they're not standing in
front of a full-length mirror.

65
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,163
Are the caterers
all set up downstairs?

66
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:25,968
Yes. Everything is set up.

67
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:29,500
Miss Blair, I not so sure
this party your best idea.

68
00:03:30,655 --> 00:03:33,206
What if we go feed ducks
in park, just the two of us?

69
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,754
Why did I go to the trouble
of putting together an elegant brunch

70
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,804
and inviting a dozen of Manhattan's
most eligible bachelors?

71
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:43,681
So world can know
Miss Blair's single again,

72
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,391
and Chuck Bass thing of past.

73
00:03:47,179 --> 00:03:49,562
But Miss Blair
not yet grieve properly.

74
00:03:50,652 --> 00:03:52,356
To rush back into dating...

75
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,532
Will show everyone
that Chuck Bass has no hold over me.

76
00:03:55,657 --> 00:03:56,821
You really need to stop

77
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:59,029
buying your prenatal vitamins
over the internet.

78
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,517
For this I postpone honeymoon.

79
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:04,250
Will you toss out that box of junk?

80
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,857
I never want to see it again.

81
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:30,853
Hello, Rufus.

82
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:33,397
Will, what the hell
are you doing here?

83
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,237
I'm here to see Lily.

84
00:04:36,002 --> 00:04:36,859
Is she home?

85
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,153
If she was,
you still wouldn't be welcome.

86
00:04:39,637 --> 00:04:41,030
You need to leave now.

87
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,158
- I'm afraid I can't do that.
- I know about this summer.

88
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,620
You've done enough damage
to this family, on all fronts.

89
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:50,449
This summer.

90
00:04:52,006 --> 00:04:53,918
She hasn't told you?

91
00:04:54,548 --> 00:04:55,718
Told me what?

92
00:04:55,843 --> 00:04:57,421
I think we should wait for Lily.

93
00:04:59,157 --> 00:05:01,508
We a all have a lot to talk about.

94
00:05:09,174 --> 00:05:12,524
There is an outlet by the bed,
and I will be in in a minute.

95
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,848
You look like hell.

96
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,318
Small price to pay
to feel like heaven.

97
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,278
Where's Archibald?

98
00:05:21,808 --> 00:05:24,114
Don't tell me you two finally

99
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,363
closed the deal.

100
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:28,119
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

101
00:05:28,405 --> 00:05:31,956
You've been panting at his loafers ever
since Serena went M.I.A. with Carter.

102
00:05:32,956 --> 00:05:34,458
Was it as you always imagined?

103
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:37,795
Late night?

104
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:39,755
You two

105
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:41,162
engaged

106
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,300
in a sweaty Wii duel...

107
00:05:44,203 --> 00:05:45,344
Your bodies touch...

108
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,985
He looks at you
like he's never looked at you before.

109
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,558
You're an ass, Chuck.
Besides, Serena's back.

110
00:05:52,662 --> 00:05:54,566
Maybe now you'll actually
have a chance.

111
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,922
Don't worry. The odds of me remembering
this conversation are slim.

112
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:00,484
Wait. What do you mean,
I'll stand a chance now?

113
00:06:01,051 --> 00:06:03,490
Archibald's never gonna cross
the line. He's a good guy.

114
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:06,017
He would cling
to Serena's golden locks

115
00:06:06,142 --> 00:06:08,367
- until she pushes him away.
- Why would she do that?

116
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,619
I mean, he's been totally patient and
understanding.

117
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,749
We know that,

118
00:06:11,874 --> 00:06:14,915
but if she were to think
Nate had betrayed her,

119
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:17,847
she would drive him
into your waiting arms in no time.

120
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,546
Why are you telling me all this?

121
00:06:20,952 --> 00:06:21,960
Because...

122
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:24,925
If I want my friend back,

123
00:06:25,296 --> 00:06:26,802
this would be done easier

124
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,688
with Serena out of the picture.

125
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:32,224
Now you need something
to make her suspicious.

126
00:06:53,844 --> 00:06:55,789
Lily told me that she renovated
this place again.

127
00:06:56,844 --> 00:06:58,798
It's come a long way
since we first moved in.

128
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,129
There have been a lot of improvements
since you left,

129
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,963
which is why you won't be staying.

130
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,178
Rufus, hello.

131
00:07:13,988 --> 00:07:15,768
Oh, god. William.

132
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,267
Dad?

133
00:07:21,383 --> 00:07:23,525
<i>Paging Serena Van Der Woodsen.</i>

134
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:26,737
<i>After a lifetime
in the daddy waiting room,</i>

135
00:07:27,694 --> 00:07:30,449
<i>it looks like
the doctor is finally in.</i>

136
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:34,912
William, what's going on?

137
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,790
I was just about to ask you that.

138
00:07:46,263 --> 00:07:48,018
It wasn't my mother who was sick.

139
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,885
It was me.

140
00:07:54,078 --> 00:07:56,244
And that's why William and I
were together last summer.

141
00:07:56,369 --> 00:07:58,159
He wasn't treating Cece.

142
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,922
He was treating me.

143
00:08:00,952 --> 00:08:03,479
Mom said that's why you wouldn't see me
when I came looking for you.

144
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,072
I wanted to see you,

145
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,557
but as her doctor,
I couldn't tell you why I was there,

146
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,530
and I didn't wanna lie.

147
00:08:11,021 --> 00:08:12,304
How are you feeling now?

148
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:14,910
Good. I'm feeling good.

149
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,662
And I just had my 6-month checkup,

150
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,957
And we'll get the results soon.

151
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,419
Yeah, the one bright spot is
that Lily's illness is very treatable.

152
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:26,128
We're just waiting on
the last round of test results,

153
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:29,633
but I'm highly optimistic
that it hasn't returned.

154
00:08:30,787 --> 00:08:33,374
I'm so sorry
you've been going through this...

155
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:35,222
alone.

156
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:39,560
I would like to move forward
As if everything is normal.

157
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:42,813
And just please
keep this between us.

158
00:08:43,592 --> 00:08:46,483
And there will be no mention
of the "c" word in this house.

159
00:08:48,137 --> 00:08:49,361
I am gonna go freshen up.

160
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:54,992
Lily, you and I still need to talk.

161
00:08:55,723 --> 00:08:56,660
Yeah.

162
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,917
My family and I
need some time alone.

163
00:09:08,835 --> 00:09:09,835
Sure.

164
00:09:12,462 --> 00:09:13,531
Listen, I...

165
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,055
know that this is a lot for you
to take in.

166
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,639
Can I convince you to go somewhere

167
00:09:19,888 --> 00:09:20,809
and talk?

168
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,201
If Eric's around,
I would love for him to join us.

169
00:09:23,426 --> 00:09:25,747
He's in and over
with the debate team.

170
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:28,618
But,

171
00:09:29,497 --> 00:09:31,934
let me just change.
Where should I meet you?

172
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,780
I'm at 60 Thompson.

173
00:09:38,485 --> 00:09:39,485
You okay?

174
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,163
Yeah.

175
00:09:41,468 --> 00:09:43,202
After all he's done for my mom,

176
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:45,167
I at least owe him a conversation.

177
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:52,238
"We regret to inform you

178
00:09:52,363 --> 00:09:54,605
"that due to the high volume
of qualified applicants,

179
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,471
"the dramatic writing program
at the tisch school of the arts..."

180
00:09:58,226 --> 00:10:01,988
"We have decided to crush your dreams
with this form letter."

181
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:04,871
Apparently,
there's only one spot for transfer

182
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:06,813
students, and I didn't get it, so...

183
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:08,939
This is really terrible.

184
00:10:09,584 --> 00:10:11,880
No, vanessa, it's okay.

185
00:10:12,302 --> 00:10:14,029
It sucks, yeah, but I'll survive.

186
00:10:14,295 --> 00:10:15,900
No, it's not that.

187
00:10:17,564 --> 00:10:18,630
It's just...

188
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:20,893
It was me.
I,

189
00:10:22,217 --> 00:10:23,372
I got the spot.

190
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,835
What?

191
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,374
I should have told you I was applying
for dramatic writing

192
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:28,971
as well as film and TV. I just

193
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,922
I honestly didn't think I had a shot.
It was only after

194
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,698
I wrote that short that I started
thinking how great would it be

195
00:10:34,823 --> 00:10:36,176
if we both got in?

196
00:10:36,705 --> 00:10:38,276
So you got the spot?

197
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:41,475
I would have never applied If I'd had
known they were only taking one transfer

198
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,683
from N.Y.U.

199
00:10:44,473 --> 00:10:45,704
You got in.

200
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,455
Well, I mean,

201
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:52,236
congratulations.

202
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,197
No, seriously,
if it wasn't gonna be me,

203
00:10:56,747 --> 00:10:58,130
I'm glad it was you.

204
00:10:59,302 --> 00:11:00,158
You are?

205
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,408
Yeah, sure, you know, and they also

206
00:11:03,008 --> 00:11:05,398
"wish me success
in my future endeavors."

207
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:09,293
So it's not a total loss.
I gotta get to a study group, but,

208
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:11,545
I think we should celebrate.

209
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,914
There's an art party in bushwick.
It should be tisch student central.

210
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:17,180
- What do you say?
- Are you sure?

211
00:11:17,672 --> 00:11:20,485
Please. Come on.
Ain't no party like a bushwick party.

212
00:11:21,176 --> 00:11:22,969
I'll call you later.
All right.

213
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,572
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I don't know.

214
00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:36,877
You have every right
to be mad at me.

215
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:39,150
I don't want to be mad.

216
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:44,163
I just want to understand.

217
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:48,417
Talk to me.

218
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:50,527
I was scared.

219
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:53,211
I was more scared
than I've ever been.

220
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:55,223
And telling you,

221
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,468
having to see the look on your face-
I couldn't bear it.

222
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:01,632
And then when Will said
that the minute

223
00:12:01,757 --> 00:12:03,764
people start treating you
like you're sick,

224
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,632
especially your loved ones, that
your body starts to listen to it, and...

225
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:11,863
I guess I just used that as
an excuse.

226
00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:15,233
Because I knew the minute
I told you,

227
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,036
it would all become so real.

228
00:12:17,951 --> 00:12:19,488
Will told you not to tell me?

229
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:22,366
Everything that he has done

230
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,724
and everything that he has said

231
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:26,578
has worked.

232
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:29,165
I know,
and that's all that's important.

233
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:34,819
Was I not clear?

234
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,818
Did I not instruct you to send out
invitations to my bachelors

235
00:12:37,943 --> 00:12:40,068
with the date,
time and location clearly marked?

236
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,302
I did. All invitations go out.

237
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,650
Then how do you explain this?

238
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,103
Did you send the invitations
by carrier pigeon?

239
00:12:52,136 --> 00:12:54,815
Is the elevator broken?
A meteor headed for earth?

240
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,068
You were against this from the start.
What did you do?

241
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,526
I do nothing.

242
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,611
Then I don't understand.

243
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:02,583
You.

244
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,588
You. Come here.

245
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,368
You're a guy.

246
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,036
I invited

247
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,009
a dozen eligible bachelors today,
and not one of them showed up.

248
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,977
- You'd be thrilled to date me, no?
- Yeah.

249
00:13:14,102 --> 00:13:15,293
You're totally hot.

250
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:17,713
Miss blair. Please.

251
00:13:18,746 --> 00:13:20,173
Maybe this is sign.

252
00:13:21,242 --> 00:13:24,043
I remember when I separate
from first husband.

253
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,265
I need answers that don't end in
"and then I came to America."

254
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,777
Wait. What did you say?

255
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,896
First husband?

256
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,148
Of course.

257
00:13:38,535 --> 00:13:40,569
What is Mr. Chuck to do with this?

258
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,086
Isn't it obvious?

259
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:44,547
He's declared a dating fatwa on me.

260
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,206
When did you get back?

261
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,842
I just got in,
and by the looks of it, so did you.

262
00:14:04,183 --> 00:14:06,136
I spent the night
at a friend's house.

263
00:14:06,691 --> 00:14:08,534
- So what's up?
- For starters,

264
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:10,140
I'm about to go see my father.

265
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:13,226
Your father?
That's amazing.

266
00:14:13,825 --> 00:14:16,145
I would love to catch up,
but I gotta run.

267
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,233
Is that Nate's shirt?

268
00:14:20,938 --> 00:14:22,005
What? No.

269
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,782
You spent the night at a friend's?

270
00:14:30,723 --> 00:14:32,891
I kinda crashed
at Nate's last night,

271
00:14:33,016 --> 00:14:35,707
but we were just hanging out,
and we totally lost track of time.

272
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:38,340
He slept on the couch.
Like,

273
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,545
you have to believe me.
You do, right?

274
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:45,050
Yeah, of course.
Look, my dad is waiting.

275
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,135
Here.
You'll probably see him before I do.

276
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,083
Dan!

277
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,817
I'm glad I ran into you.

278
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,071
Are you okay?

279
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:03,876
I take it you heard?

280
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:05,341
I'm so sorry.

281
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:08,091
I was really looking forward
to you being at tisch next year.

282
00:15:08,216 --> 00:15:10,986
Honestly,
I never really thought she'd get it.

283
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,939
Wait. So even you knew
that Vanessa was applying?

284
00:15:14,064 --> 00:15:15,330
And you didn't.

285
00:15:15,944 --> 00:15:18,208
- That hurts.
- Yes, on a few levels,

286
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,253
like the fact that her submission was
based on my story in <i>The New Yorker</i>,

287
00:15:21,794 --> 00:15:22,794
whatever.

288
00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:26,459
You know submissions
have to be original works, right?

289
00:15:28,592 --> 00:15:31,556
I'm sure she didn't do it on purpose.
It's fine. If I'm not gonna get in,

290
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,349
It might as well go to vanessa.

291
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,615
You know how my dad's on the board
of directors, right?

292
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,450
He told me you were the runner-up,

293
00:15:39,575 --> 00:15:41,759
That it came down to you
and Vanessa.

294
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,150
You're kidding.

295
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,194
That was your spot.
The school has to know.

296
00:15:48,028 --> 00:15:50,574
I'm not gonna do that to her.
She's my girlfriend. She got in,

297
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,367
and, I have to deal with it.

298
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:55,816
I'll see you later? You're performing
at that party in bushwick, right?

299
00:15:55,941 --> 00:15:57,961
- Yeah, but...
- All right, I'll see you then.

300
00:16:06,314 --> 00:16:08,060
Hi, daddy. It's me.

301
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,146
- You just called me.
- Why didn't you answer?

302
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,740
And what are you doing here?

303
00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:16,224
Call me crazy.
I thought we should talk in person.

304
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,345
But you're obviously
on your way out.

305
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,103
I'm going to meet with my father.

306
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:22,439
Since when?
What's he doing here?

307
00:16:23,969 --> 00:16:27,028
It's complicated. I know that's not
what you want to hear right now,

308
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,738
- But if you could just wait-
- I've been waiting, Serena.

309
00:16:30,743 --> 00:16:33,742
And were you waiting alone, or was
someone there to keep you company?

310
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,244
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. You know what?

311
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,330
- Just keep your secrets.
- You're accusing me

312
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,262
of keeping secrets? You kidding me?

313
00:16:40,387 --> 00:16:42,626
Can we not do this right now?
I have a lot going on.

314
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,628
My guess is you're not
gonna tell me.

315
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:45,930
I can't.

316
00:16:46,535 --> 00:16:48,381
I just-
I need you to understand that.

317
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,133
And you'll tell me everything later.

318
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,835
I've heard it before.


319
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,179
This time
I'm not gonna hold my breath.

320
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,632
<i>Prep the O.R., kiddies.
Looks like Jenny Humphrey</i>

321
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,976
<i>is scrubbing up to surgically remove</i>

322
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,255
<i>a boyfriend.</i>

323
00:17:07,222 --> 00:17:10,528
- So what's step two?
- <i>Get him drunk. Take advantage of him.</i>

324
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,071
Do women just not get this?

325
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,867
He's not gonna go drinking with me.
He made me call my dad when I stayed.

326
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,020
Be here, 6:00 sharp.

327
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:21,309
And look like someone
who doesn't even have a father.

328
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:25,864
You twisted, manipulative

329
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,137
psychopath.

330
00:17:27,974 --> 00:17:29,126
How could you?

331
00:17:29,499 --> 00:17:31,951
You're going to have to be
a tad more specific.

332
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:33,924
It's been a busy few days.

333
00:17:34,415 --> 00:17:35,387
My party.

334
00:17:35,934 --> 00:17:38,946
Right. I heard about
your little rebound reception.

335
00:17:39,682 --> 00:17:41,382
Good for you, moving on.

336
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:45,438
You'll pretend like you're innocent
with the fact that no one showed up?

337
00:17:45,894 --> 00:17:47,691
That you didn't put
a dating fatwa on me?

338
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,360
We're over, chuck.
Unclench.

339
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:53,441
To set the record straight,
I didn't put a fatwa on you.

340
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:56,199
The reason no one showed up today is

341
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,160
because no one could ever
measure up to what we had,

342
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:01,564
And I'm obviously not the only guy

343
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,841
who knows that.

344
00:18:04,347 --> 00:18:05,194
Fine.

345
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:07,335
If you won't move on, I will.

346
00:18:07,745 --> 00:18:09,517
There are guys
outside the Upper East Side,

347
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,081
and by this time tomorrow,

348
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:15,218
everyone in the five boroughs will know
that Chuck Bass' threats mean nothing.

349
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:24,321
Willa. What's up?
Thank you.

350
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:27,470
<i>I'm about to head out to Bushwick.
Get a vibe on the space tonight.</i>

351
00:18:27,595 --> 00:18:29,755
<i>But I told my dad John
about Vanessa's submission.</i>

352
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,444
<i>The dean'll call
for a review of her application.</i>

353
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,655
- She'll be rejected, and you'll be in.
- You did what?

354
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,545
- Gotta go tune my instrument.
- No. Willa...

355
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,870
- We'll celebrate tonight.
- No, Willa, don't hang...

356
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,447
And suddenly I found myself caught in
the middle of a civil war in the congo.

357
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,268
Wait. When was that?

358
00:18:51,905 --> 00:18:55,054
That was after hurricane Mitch
and before Kosovo,

359
00:18:55,477 --> 00:18:57,052
so '98, '99.

360
00:18:57,476 --> 00:18:59,630
You know, my '98

361
00:18:59,755 --> 00:19:01,385
was actually pretty similar.

362
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,234
We were just coming out
of the civil war

363
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,519
between Lily
and the republic of Claus.

364
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:10,469
What do you say we get out
of here, go to Serendipity?

365
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:13,568
I remember how much you used
to love their banana splits.

366
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,331
I was 4.

367
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:19,745
You're right. I shouldn't...

368
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:22,118
presume to even know you.

369
00:19:23,148 --> 00:19:26,164
This gulf, this chasm
that's between us,

370
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,141
It's gonna take some time, but...

371
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:31,252
We can make it go away.

372
00:19:32,235 --> 00:19:33,691
You may be here for my mom now,

373
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,424
but that doesn't explain
the last 14 years.

374
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,201
You just left.

375
00:19:43,506 --> 00:19:44,539
It wasn't

376
00:19:45,773 --> 00:19:47,143
exactly like that.

377
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,145
Then what was it like?

378
00:19:53,462 --> 00:19:54,523
Thank you.

379
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,779
I'm glad you called.
How are you doing?

380
00:19:58,418 --> 00:19:59,937
I'm okay.

381
00:20:01,057 --> 00:20:02,700
Do you remember
how Tisch required you

382
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,824
- to submit an original piece?
- Tell me about it.

383
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,898
I was so stressed, and then the night
before the application was due,

384
00:20:09,023 --> 00:20:09,999
it came to me.

385
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:12,252
What came to you?

386
00:20:15,204 --> 00:20:16,871
I would love

387
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,208
for you to read it.

388
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:21,344
- What is this?
- It's my piece for the application.

389
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:23,513
My first original play.

390
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,557
It's your first original?

391
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,017
And while it's not based
on anything you've written,

392
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:30,225
It was based on you.

393
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,480
On us, really.

394
00:20:34,678 --> 00:20:36,072
I don't know what to say.

395
00:20:37,628 --> 00:20:40,864
I can't watch you read, so I'm
gonna head back to the dorms.

396
00:20:41,418 --> 00:20:43,533
But why don't we just skip the party

397
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:45,201
and order pizza?

398
00:20:45,755 --> 00:20:47,328
Okay. Sounds good.

399
00:20:56,398 --> 00:20:58,214
Well, the plan was
to find a new home base,

400
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,291
so I could

401
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,342
get us all out of here.

402
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:03,603
What, you wanted us to come?

403
00:21:04,075 --> 00:21:04,888
Of course.

404
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,502
That was the plan.

405
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,892
So I took the post in Tibet.

406
00:21:09,386 --> 00:21:11,478
I tried to commute
while I got settled in.

407
00:21:11,673 --> 00:21:14,623
Commute from Tibet to J.F.K.?

408
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,870
I promised Lily
that I would be home on a Tuesday

409
00:21:17,995 --> 00:21:21,029
and I would show up on Friday,
the following week.

410
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,393
- It didn't take long before she...
- Wanted a divorce, yeah.

411
00:21:26,634 --> 00:21:29,459
I couldn't blame her
for needing consistency in her life,

412
00:21:30,648 --> 00:21:31,748
in your lives.

413
00:21:34,045 --> 00:21:35,996
I don't want you to think
that one day I woke up

414
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:38,972
and decided
that I was gonna leave you

415
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,797
and never come back.

416
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,601
After a while,

417
00:21:44,478 --> 00:21:46,429
I just didn't know how.

418
00:21:47,811 --> 00:21:48,956
So that's it?

419
00:21:49,964 --> 00:21:52,727
You just forgot how to be a father?

420
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:01,683
Last name's Van Der Woodsen.
Let him know he has a visitor.

421
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:08,878
If you'll excuse me for a moment...

422
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:19,504
I've got plenty of fresh towels,

423
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,440
but thanks for checking in.

424
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,883
I'm actually here
to make sure you check out.

425
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,304
You don't trust me.
I get it.

426
00:22:28,618 --> 00:22:30,348
If I were going by the me
of 20 years ago,

427
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:31,975
I wouldn't trust myself either,

428
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:35,227
- but people change, Rufus.
- Really?

429
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:39,107
Because telling Lily to hide her illness
from us islike the guy I used to know.

430
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:41,368
Lily needed to remain positive.

431
00:22:41,922 --> 00:22:42,935
And if I may say,

432
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:45,371
- it worked.
- For that, I'm eternally grateful,

433
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:48,669
Now that I'm part of this,
she gets a new doctor,

434
00:22:48,794 --> 00:22:50,785
One I can be certain
has only one agenda.

435
00:22:51,507 --> 00:22:54,706
- Rufus, what are you doing here?
- I'm sorry for intruding.

436
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,375
- I'll see you at home.
- Wait. I'll come with you.

437
00:23:00,695 --> 00:23:03,679
I just need some time to think.
Okay?

438
00:23:09,784 --> 00:23:11,497
<i>This is Willa.
Leave me a message.</i>

439
00:23:11,622 --> 00:23:14,361
Willa, you need to call you father
and have him undo whatever it was he did

440
00:23:14,486 --> 00:23:16,034
before the dean calls Vanessa,

441
00:23:16,641 --> 00:23:18,312
- because it would be...
- Humphrey.

442
00:23:19,313 --> 00:23:21,541
I'll call you.
What do you want, Blair?

443
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,736
I'm about to explain,
so if you'd remain silent

444
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,183
- until you hear the story...
- This is not a good time.

445
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:30,074
I'm not even close to done.

446
00:23:32,637 --> 00:23:35,872
Chuck has put a dating fatwa on me.

447
00:23:36,353 --> 00:23:38,291
So unless I find some guy to kiss me

448
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:40,334
so I can splash it
all over "Gossip Girl,"

449
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:43,463
I might as well just pack up
and join a convent.

450
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,132
I need a night out
away from the Upper East Side,

451
00:23:47,102 --> 00:23:48,676
away from Manhattan, actually.

452
00:23:49,108 --> 00:23:51,961
There was this art party that Vanessa
and I were gonna go to, but I...

453
00:23:52,086 --> 00:23:54,682
A party where you two
are guests. Perfect.

454
00:23:55,146 --> 00:23:56,306
Brimming with young men

455
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,587
who are not socially astute enough
to fear the length of the Bass arm.

456
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,851
I have more important
things right now to...

457
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,386
Actually, I'm sorry.

458
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:09,405
There is someone at that party
that I need to talk to.

459
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,543
Wonderful.

460
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:13,663
Now I'll need
a disguise if I'm to blend in.

461
00:24:13,788 --> 00:24:15,453
Perhaps Vanessa
can loan me a serape?

462
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,165
Stuff between me and your dad
goes a long way back,

463
00:24:23,737 --> 00:24:26,120
but don't let that get in the way
of your relationship with him.

464
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:29,431
I won't. Right now I just need
to keep things about my mom,

465
00:24:29,556 --> 00:24:31,010
think about what's best for her.

466
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:32,631
I'll see you soon.

467
00:24:36,453 --> 00:24:37,517
That was William,

468
00:24:38,372 --> 00:24:40,728
and he got the test results.

469
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,898
They're not what we hoped.

470
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:50,648
Art party. Brooklyn.

471
00:24:51,752 --> 00:24:53,121
She wasn't kidding.

472
00:24:54,129 --> 00:24:55,710
$500 it is.

473
00:24:56,021 --> 00:24:58,121
I know an R.A.
Can use the money.

474
00:25:01,977 --> 00:25:03,907
You look like you could use a drink.

475
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:13,177
What's your problem?

476
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,013
You know what you did to Blair.

477
00:25:17,175 --> 00:25:18,532
And I'm paying for it.

478
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:22,270
- Seems like you're enjoying yourself.
- After all these years,

479
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,830
You can't see through
one of my smoke screens?

480
00:25:26,978 --> 00:25:29,986
I'm not asking for forgiveness.
I did what I did,

481
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,741
but we have been best friends

482
00:25:34,152 --> 00:25:36,268
since before I can remember,
and I thought...

483
00:25:39,818 --> 00:25:42,498
I know Serena went with Carter,
and I know she's back.

484
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:45,278
I just thought
you could use a drink,

485
00:25:46,532 --> 00:25:47,964
maybe get out of the city,

486
00:25:49,723 --> 00:25:51,007
even if it's with me.

487
00:26:02,151 --> 00:26:03,811
Getting out of the city
is a good idea.

488
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,148
What do you have in mind?

489
00:26:07,902 --> 00:26:09,275
Brooklyn, actually.

490
00:26:10,877 --> 00:26:12,433
And I invited along

491
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:13,863
a local guide.

492
00:26:16,383 --> 00:26:17,366
You guys ready?

493
00:26:32,462 --> 00:26:35,544
By midnight,
everyone who reads "Gossip Girl"

494
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:37,409
will see me kissing some guy,

495
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:39,315
Chuck's fatwa will kaput,

496
00:26:40,355 --> 00:26:41,849
and I'll have my life back.

497
00:26:42,437 --> 00:26:44,241
Are you sure you wanna be here?

498
00:26:44,366 --> 00:26:46,670
Yeah. It's not fair
what Chuck's doing to her,

499
00:26:46,795 --> 00:26:49,268
and I really don't want
this Tisch thing to come between us.

500
00:26:49,393 --> 00:26:50,874
- Me neither.
- I'm gonna go find

501
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:52,591
my sacrificial lamb and the bar.

502
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:56,301
I should follow her, 'cause I don't want
her to spill on my leggings.

503
00:27:04,467 --> 00:27:05,799
I'll get some drinks.

504
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:09,600
I don't know why you invited her.

505
00:27:09,725 --> 00:27:11,928
What, I thought you two were
as thick as Wiis.

506
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,019
Not for a night out drinking.

507
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,384
She's still just a kid.

508
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:17,953
She's a junior,

509
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,222
older than Serena when the two of you
christened the Campbell apartment.

510
00:27:23,116 --> 00:27:24,058
And honestly,

511
00:27:24,994 --> 00:27:26,575
does she look like a kid to you?

512
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,004
So...

513
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:33,648
Columbia?

514
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:37,238
I'm impressed. This doesn't really seem
like an Ivy League party.

515
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:40,408
- What are you doing here?
- I'm friends with the ownerof the loft.

516
00:27:42,076 --> 00:27:42,997
Oh, god.

517
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,709
Is that an Aaron Rose?

518
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:47,081
Pretty sure that's Ikea.

519
00:27:48,964 --> 00:27:50,334
Not bad, Columbia.

520
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:52,086
Name's Cameron.

521
00:27:59,181 --> 00:28:01,272
Is it suddenly
unbearably hot in here?

522
00:28:01,988 --> 00:28:02,888
Are you okay?

523
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:07,226
I'm better now.

524
00:28:09,297 --> 00:28:10,229
Thank you.

525
00:28:13,963 --> 00:28:15,484
You're just in time.

526
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,697
I'm about to serve up a venti-sized
serving of artistic justice.

527
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,657
Tell me that you got
one of my 200 messages.

528
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:24,293
Nope.
Told you I was getting in the zone.

529
00:28:24,656 --> 00:28:27,457
- Were you calling to thank me?
- Vanessa submitted an original piece.

530
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:29,690
You need to tell your dad
that there's been a mistake.

531
00:28:30,224 --> 00:28:31,740
So she wrote something else.

532
00:28:31,865 --> 00:28:33,502
She belongs at Tisch more than you?

533
00:28:34,644 --> 00:28:35,639
You deserve it.

534
00:28:36,827 --> 00:28:38,007
You can thank me later.

535
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,094
I'm with Vanessa.

536
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,562
You're "with" Vanessa?
What are you, 40?

537
00:28:48,851 --> 00:28:50,436
Who was that slut?

538
00:28:51,203 --> 00:28:52,834
Just call your father.

539
00:28:57,524 --> 00:28:59,698
What are you doing here?
Start with "Dad knows"

540
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:01,984
and end
with "These drinks are not for me."

541
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,660
Since I haven't actually talked
to dad today, no.

542
00:29:06,198 --> 00:29:07,940
But these drinks are
for Nate and Chuck.

543
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,982
What are you doing
with Nate and Chuck?

544
00:29:10,252 --> 00:29:13,000
Nate's my friend, and Chuck's
totally harmless unless this place runs

545
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,005
out of ice.

546
00:29:15,108 --> 00:29:17,146
Does Vanessa know that girl
who was hitting on you?

547
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,553
No, she wasn't...

548
00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:22,760
Wait a second. Why do you go from zero
to blackmail in 60 seconds?

549
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,845
Dan, it was actually a question.

550
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:38,484
A relapse is not uncommon.

551
00:29:39,253 --> 00:29:42,900
We just need another round of treatment,
make some adjustments. That's all.

552
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,617
We need a second opinion.

553
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,994
We're at the epicenter
of the best medical care,

554
00:29:49,483 --> 00:29:51,748
and whatever we need to do,
We can do it together, here.

555
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:56,259
If that's what you want, Lily.
I'll call a friend at Sloan-Kettering.

556
00:29:56,664 --> 00:29:59,380
But even if you do
go with another doctor,

557
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:00,636
I'll stay,

558
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:04,677
because I need to know you're well.

559
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:08,264
We should stay with dad.

560
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,212
He's already cured mom once,

561
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,768
and he is family.

562
00:30:16,252 --> 00:30:18,524
I think I prefer it, too, Rufus.

563
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:21,050
He's already familiar
with every aspect of my case,

564
00:30:21,175 --> 00:30:24,286
and I know what to expect
of the treatment, and Serena's right.

565
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:26,532
William is family.

566
00:30:28,512 --> 00:30:29,520
Sure.

567
00:30:30,339 --> 00:30:31,634
If that's what you want.

568
00:30:32,694 --> 00:30:33,901
I'll make some calls.

569
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:37,209
We'll get started first thing tomorrow.
And, like Rufus says,

570
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,813
we're all in this together.

571
00:30:46,947 --> 00:30:49,096
Hey. I wasn't expecting you.

572
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,307
Is this a bad time?
I kinda need to talk.

573
00:30:51,855 --> 00:30:53,642
No. It's fine.
Are you okay?

574
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,312
Things aren't really going so well.

575
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,397
Chuck wants us to do shots.

576
00:30:58,948 --> 00:30:59,899
Is that Jenny?

577
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:01,957
Yeah, we're sort of at this party.

578
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:03,388
It's Serena.

579
00:31:04,094 --> 00:31:06,572
- <i>I can't believe this.</i>
- Why? What's wrong?

580
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,747
Nothing. I called to talk to you,

581
00:31:08,872 --> 00:31:11,470
and you're at a party
with Jenny Humphrey?

582
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,635
<i>So what?
It's no big deal.</i>

583
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,165
Just like her spending the night
wasn't a big deal?

584
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,876
What?
How do you know about that?

585
00:31:19,941 --> 00:31:23,088
You know what? Never mind. I changed
my mind. I have nothing to say to you.

586
00:31:35,255 --> 00:31:38,479
Chuck, your plan sucks. He's
on the phone with Serena right now.

587
00:31:38,826 --> 00:31:40,523
That's not necessarily a bad thing.

588
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:41,839
I'm over this party.

589
00:31:41,964 --> 00:31:43,901
Let's just go back to the suite
and get hammered.

590
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,173
You two run along.

591
00:31:45,469 --> 00:31:47,124
I'm gonna stick around for a while.

592
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:49,615
You up for it?

593
00:31:51,385 --> 00:31:52,294
Absolutely.

594
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:56,758
<i>Spotted... Nate Archibald
suffering from a broken heart.</i>

595
00:31:57,187 --> 00:31:57,985
<i>Too bad</i>

596
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,151
<i>he doesn't realize
Jenny's oath is less</i>

597
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:01,700
<i>hippocratic and more</i>

598
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,965
<i>hypocrite.</i>

599
00:32:09,264 --> 00:32:11,095
Come on.
You're an art history major.

600
00:32:12,725 --> 00:32:13,847
Admit it.

601
00:32:14,277 --> 00:32:15,098
This art

602
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,240
is atrocious.

603
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,520
I don't know.
The Ikea orb's growing on me.

604
00:32:21,644 --> 00:32:22,951
Actually, I have a friend

605
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,448
who goes to Columbia,

606
00:32:24,573 --> 00:32:26,402
though he attends that many classes.

607
00:32:27,774 --> 00:32:30,155
Do you want to make that guy
who showed up jealous or what?

608
00:32:31,109 --> 00:32:31,949
Excuse me?

609
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,442
I saw you two.

610
00:32:34,372 --> 00:32:35,786
Your ex-boyfriend?

611
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:38,706
You want to prove to him you're
over him, ready to move on?

612
00:32:39,238 --> 00:32:40,708
Just have to take the plunge.

613
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,390
Show him the past is the past.

614
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:44,421
I like you.

615
00:32:45,156 --> 00:32:46,463
I'm game if you are.

616
00:32:50,288 --> 00:32:51,135
I'm game.

617
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,426
- Where are you going?
- Home.

618
00:32:57,551 --> 00:32:58,994
I don't know what Willa told you,

619
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:01,235
but keep in mind,
she carries around lighter fluid.

620
00:33:01,554 --> 00:33:04,238
You told her that my tTsch sample
was adapted from your story?

621
00:33:05,136 --> 00:33:06,094
It slipped out.

622
00:33:06,219 --> 00:33:08,821
But you wrote an original piece,
you don't have anything to worry about.

623
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,615
Because Willa's gonna call her father
and straighten it out with the dean?

624
00:33:12,936 --> 00:33:15,993
Thanks. You really made sure
I was off to a great start.

625
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,201
You're not being fair.
That was not my fault.

626
00:33:18,326 --> 00:33:21,151
I asked you if you were okay
with me getting in.

627
00:33:21,823 --> 00:33:23,418
- Why weren't you honest?
- Like you,

628
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,170
going behind my back to apply
for the one thing I wanted the most?

629
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,172
I explained that.

630
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,654
No, you justified that.

631
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,511
You said that if you knew there'd been
one spot, you wouldn't have applied.

632
00:33:36,021 --> 00:33:37,097
What are you saying?

633
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,809
You want me to withdraw
my application?

634
00:33:43,683 --> 00:33:45,113
No, of course not.

635
00:33:45,866 --> 00:33:47,733
But what were you expecting
my reaction to be?

636
00:33:52,272 --> 00:33:53,322
I don't know.

637
00:33:56,677 --> 00:33:57,743
Not this.

638
00:34:03,233 --> 00:34:04,598
You're taking off?

639
00:34:04,723 --> 00:34:06,527
I want to get started
first thing tomorrow.

640
00:34:06,652 --> 00:34:08,170
There's no time to waste.

641
00:34:11,117 --> 00:34:13,270
I still don't know
what I want from you.

642
00:34:16,735 --> 00:34:18,305
You know, today I was

643
00:34:18,802 --> 00:34:22,088
planning on giving you
a big speech on regret,

644
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:23,348
but...

645
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:26,409
your mother's illness,
her reaching out to me,

646
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:28,302
us reconnecting...

647
00:34:32,922 --> 00:34:34,639
I have to believe there's a purpose

648
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:35,948
behind all of this.

649
00:34:37,821 --> 00:34:39,368
But you've missed so much.

650
00:34:43,086 --> 00:34:44,248
I know.

651
00:34:44,688 --> 00:34:46,518
I've followed you from afar,

652
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,020
glimpsed a photo here and there.

653
00:34:49,776 --> 00:34:51,422
Wasn't thrilled about that horse

654
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,984
- at the polo match.
- That was sort of the point.

655
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:58,303
Thank you.

656
00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:00,471
I know you have

657
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,058
no reason to trust or believe me,

658
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:05,298
so...

659
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,604
I really appreciate
the second chance.

660
00:35:09,111 --> 00:35:10,774
Everyone deserves one.

661
00:35:12,373 --> 00:35:15,029
I'm not sure Rufus would necessarily
agree with that,

662
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:16,037
but...

663
00:35:17,058 --> 00:35:19,992
for what it's worth,
I plan to prove him wrong.

664
00:35:36,272 --> 00:35:38,393
I haven't read any posts
on "Gossip Girl" yet.

665
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:40,592
I guess my ban works
in the provinces.

666
00:35:41,962 --> 00:35:42,839
I knew it.

667
00:35:43,487 --> 00:35:46,437
- I knew you'd fatwa'd me.
- And I knew you couldn't break it.

668
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:48,020
You're wrong.
I could have.

669
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,432
Then why didn't you?

670
00:35:50,152 --> 00:35:51,235
Because...

671
00:35:52,898 --> 00:35:54,363
I suddenly realized it.

672
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:58,989
The way to get over you isn't
by hooking up with some random guy

673
00:35:59,482 --> 00:36:01,700
or pretending like we didn't happen.

674
00:36:03,547 --> 00:36:05,004
You and I loved each other.

675
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:09,312
And then you broke my heart.

676
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:13,378
I've been doing everything
possible not to face that fact.

677
00:36:16,528 --> 00:36:18,283
I'm gonna kiss somebody someday,

678
00:36:19,366 --> 00:36:20,549
and when I do,

679
00:36:21,707 --> 00:36:22,765
it'll be for me.

680
00:36:26,088 --> 00:36:26,975
Good-bye.

681
00:36:27,943 --> 00:36:28,936
I'm going home.

682
00:36:37,235 --> 00:36:38,612
What is wrong with me?

683
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,959
Nothing's wrong with you.

684
00:36:41,892 --> 00:36:43,367
Don't you know how great you are?

685
00:36:45,317 --> 00:36:47,022
I'm serious.

686
00:36:47,147 --> 00:36:49,915
I probably shouldn't say this,
but you've said it to me once before.

687
00:36:50,635 --> 00:36:52,776
You deserve someone
who's gonna treat you right,

688
00:36:54,653 --> 00:36:55,879
not like Serena does.

689
00:36:59,162 --> 00:37:01,206
It's true.
I would never treat you

690
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:02,363
like she does.

691
00:37:04,018 --> 00:37:05,389
You deserve better, Nate.

692
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,289
<i>In case
you've never heard one before...</i>

693
00:37:13,421 --> 00:37:16,608
<i>That's the sound
of a relationship flatlining.</i>

694
00:37:19,509 --> 00:37:22,060
- I know what this looks like.
- You do? Great.

695
00:37:22,185 --> 00:37:24,616
As long as you know
how it looks, then I guess I'm good.

696
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,275
That's not what I meant.
Stop.

697
00:37:28,775 --> 00:37:29,988
What are you doing here?

698
00:37:30,113 --> 00:37:33,169
I came to apologize for not hearing
you out earlier, and then I walk in

699
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,680
- to see her trying to kiss you?
- But I didn't.

700
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,337
Nothing happened.

701
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,632
Same as last night, which I'd have told
you about, if you hadn't hung up on me.

702
00:37:41,047 --> 00:37:44,219
What about the things she said about me?
Is that really what you think?

703
00:37:45,857 --> 00:37:46,638
He does.

704
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:47,931
I'm talking to Nate.

705
00:37:50,555 --> 00:37:51,405
Well?

706
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,937
Do I wonder why you don't
trust me anymore? Yeah, I do.

707
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:57,247
You don't tell me about looking
for your dad and you leave with Baizen.

708
00:37:57,846 --> 00:38:00,777
And then you come back and you shut
me out. What am I supposed to think?

709
00:38:02,242 --> 00:38:05,157
I'm sorry. I should have told you
that I was looking for my father.

710
00:38:05,645 --> 00:38:09,592
But I didn't leave with Carter. You know
that. I even tried to apologize.

711
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:11,455
What are you talking about?

712
00:38:11,863 --> 00:38:14,946
The night of Dorota's wedding, I called
your cell to explain everything.

713
00:38:15,071 --> 00:38:16,627
I even left a message with Jenny.

714
00:38:17,978 --> 00:38:19,173
What message?

715
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:20,613
I never talked to her, Nate.

716
00:38:20,738 --> 00:38:22,841
For once, please,
don't let her do this to you.

717
00:38:24,864 --> 00:38:27,845
I left you a message, Nate.
She said she would tell you.

718
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,893
She's lying! I never talked to her.

719
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:31,006
Just get out.

720
00:38:32,264 --> 00:38:34,571
- What?
- Seriously, Jenny, just please leave.

721
00:38:42,013 --> 00:38:43,654
You two deserve each other.

722
00:38:52,752 --> 00:38:54,039
Sorry, Miss Blair.

723
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:55,563
I forget to take away.

724
00:38:55,688 --> 00:38:57,417
I know you not want to see anymore.

725
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:58,665
Give me that.

726
00:39:01,094 --> 00:39:03,048
It's no use to deny the past.

727
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,771
Chuck is a part of me.

728
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,553
He'll always be.

729
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:11,807
It just hurts so much.

730
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:15,089
In Poland, we have a saying

731
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,518
"love is like head wound."

732
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,251
It make you dizzy,

733
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,152
you think you die

734
00:39:22,085 --> 00:39:23,325
But you recover...

735
00:39:24,377 --> 00:39:25,223
Usually.

736
00:39:26,374 --> 00:39:27,906
That's a terrible saying.

737
00:39:33,378 --> 00:39:34,871
Tomorrow can we feed the ducks?

738
00:39:36,104 --> 00:39:37,249
I already buy bread.

739
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,023
Sorry. I had to talk
to my mom first.

740
00:39:49,686 --> 00:39:50,819
Before I tell you

741
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:53,072
what I need to tell you,
I want you to know

742
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:55,250
that I do trust you.

743
00:39:56,506 --> 00:39:58,770
And if I'm guilty of anything,

744
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,328
it's taking you for granted,

745
00:40:00,975 --> 00:40:02,723
For assuming you'd always be around.

746
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:07,696
And I promise,
I won't do that again.

747
00:40:09,799 --> 00:40:11,616
Serena, what's going on?

748
00:40:12,442 --> 00:40:15,370
<i>To revive a struggling relationship,

749
00:40:15,751 --> 00:40:18,156
<i>when we must stop protecting
what we have...</i>

750
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,820
The reason I couldn't
talk to you earlier,

751
00:40:22,195 --> 00:40:24,143
it's not about my dad.
It was about my mom.

752
00:40:26,942 --> 00:40:27,988
She's sick,

753
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,927
and I don't know
what's gonna happen.

754
00:40:31,581 --> 00:40:33,859
<i>To allow for what we truly need,</i>

755
00:40:35,702 --> 00:40:38,029
<i>moving forward can mean
reaching out...</i>

756
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:54,695
<i>Reaching back or reaching balance.</i>

757
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,758
Thank you, Rufus.

758
00:40:57,106 --> 00:40:59,430
I know William being back
is hard for you.

759
00:41:02,191 --> 00:41:04,251
All that matters is
you getting better.

760
00:41:04,376 --> 00:41:07,217
<i>And while new journeys
can start with a single step,</i>

761
00:41:07,491 --> 00:41:10,464
<i>they can end just as quickly
with a single misstep.</i>

762
00:41:11,074 --> 00:41:12,564
<i>Hey, Vanessa. It's me.</i>

763
00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:14,580
<i>Listen, I just read your play,</i>

764
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,486
<i>and it's amazing.</i>

765
00:41:16,611 --> 00:41:17,866
<i>I'm so, so sorry.</i>

766
00:41:18,613 --> 00:41:19,768
<i>Please call me.</i>

767

00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:27,451

00:41:27,744 --> 00:41:28,653
It's Will.

770
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,263
It's not working
exactly as I'd hoped.

771
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,304
I need you to write Lily
another prescription.

772
00:41:35,185 --> 00:41:37,494
You can't back out now.
I need you to make this work.

773
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:41,340
I doubt the authorities would be pleased
to know what you've been doing.
