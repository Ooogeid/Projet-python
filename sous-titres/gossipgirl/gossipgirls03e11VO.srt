1
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:09,322
I loved you.
You loved me  ?

2
00:00:09,322 --> 00:00:12,072
I hope i'm not interrupting.
We are so hard on you

3
00:00:12,204 --> 00:00:15,106
Because we want you to challenge
yourself, to be your own person.

4
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:17,642
(Blair) how exactly did you get
graham to ditch jenny for kira?

5
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:19,844
I told graham that
what happens at camp suisse

6
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:22,147
Doesn't stay at camp suisse.
It's about who you've become.

7
00:00:22,181 --> 00:00:24,616
I liked you because you were
different from everyone else.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,918
I'm sorry, eric, but it's over.
(Olivia) you were looking at vanessa

9
00:00:27,953 --> 00:00:30,955
Like you've never looked at me.
You were the one that needed

10
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,957
To kiss her again,
to realize for yourself

11
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,926
That your feelings for her are real.
My wife isn't who i thought she was

12
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:38,129
And neither is my marriage.
I don't know anything anymore.

13
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:41,866
I just know i don't want
to be alone.

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,601
(Blair) you went looking
for your father?

15
00:00:43,636 --> 00:00:46,638
Yeah, and i-I found him, too,
but he didn't want to see me.

16
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:49,207
<i>And who am i?</i>

17
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:52,677
<i>That's a secret
i'll never tell.</i>

18
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:54,679
<i>You know you love me.</i>

19
00:00:54,713 --> 00:00:57,649
<i>X.O.X.O., gossip girl.</i>

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,588
<i>Thanksgiving began
when the pilgrims and indians</i>

21
00:01:02,622 --> 00:01:05,358
<i>Came together to share
the bountiful harvest.</i>

22
00:01:05,392 --> 00:01:07,360
Okay, i've got the stuffing.

23
00:01:07,394 --> 00:01:09,862
And, jenny, you have
the sweet potatoes, as usual.

24
00:01:09,897 --> 00:01:13,532
Eric, what's your tradition? 
I, um, don't think we van der woodsens

25
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:14,722
Have any thanksgiving traditions. 

26
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:17,703
Serena apologizes, but she won't be able to
make it tomorrow.

27
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,605
I stand corrected. 
She has to work on thanksgiving?

28
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:21,573
Well, tripp has his staff

29
00:01:21,608 --> 00:01:23,709
Volunteering
at a soup kitchen,

30
00:01:23,743 --> 00:01:25,711
And with scott and his parents
at the cape,

31
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:27,713
And my mother
still unable to travel,

32
00:01:27,747 --> 00:01:29,848
It looks like it's just
going to be us and daniel.

33
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:32,584
Would you mind if i
just walked down to grace's

34
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:35,221
And ordered
one of their turkey dinners

35
00:01:35,255 --> 00:01:38,690
So we don't have to cook?
Um, actually, lily, dad was just--

36
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:41,894
Thinking the same thing.
Keep it small, hassle-Free.

37
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:43,529
(Whispers) thank you.

38
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:45,898
Sorry, rufus, but you can't
really blame her.

39
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:48,167
Our thanksgivings tend to end
with french fries at a diner

40
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:51,452
And someone having been in a
mental institution. 

41
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:53,936
Yeah, but why don't we show her 
that this thanksgiving's gonna be different?

42
00:01:53,936 --> 00:01:55,459
Well, there's nothing
we can do about serena,

43
00:01:55,494 --> 00:01:57,831
But i can set up a video chat
on my netbook

44
00:01:57,866 --> 00:02:00,313
And give grandma a place at the table.
A cece you can unplug. That's perfect.

45
00:02:00,347 --> 00:02:03,049
Let's go give it a test run.

46
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:08,003
Hey, why don't you invite jonathan?
Jonathan and i aren't really happening anymore.

47
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,121
What? Since when?
A while now.

48
00:02:09,156 --> 00:02:12,591
Well, what happened?
Let's not talk about it.

49
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:15,694
<i>On the upper east side,
that tradition is upheld</i>

50
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:19,731
<i>With a bountiful harvest
of secrets, lies and scandal.</i>

51
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:23,836
(Man) ?Ooh ?

52
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,005
(Chimes)

53
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,075
?Ooh ?

54
00:02:33,043 --> 00:02:34,845
Good afternoon, congressman.

55
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,481
I have the press schedule
you asked for.

56
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,552
(Lowers voice) so did
you talk to maureen yet?

57
00:02:42,587 --> 00:02:44,554
Last night.
She wasn't too happy about it,

58
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:46,590
But she agreed to the divorce.

59
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,592
Maureen's coming into town
so our people

60
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,994
Can write a joint statement
explaining the split.

61
00:02:51,028 --> 00:02:53,730
Of course the public
won't get the real reason.

62
00:02:53,765 --> 00:02:55,599
And the real reason is?

63
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,602
I'm sorry.
I just need to hear

64
00:02:58,636 --> 00:02:59,375
That you're not leaving her
because of me.

65
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,494
Maureen orchestrated a fraud
to win the election.

66
00:03:02,494 --> 00:03:07,110
If you walked away right now,
my decision wouldn't change.

67
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:09,345
But...

68
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,180
I hope you won't.

69
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:14,350
I have to.

70
00:03:14,385 --> 00:03:17,353
You're married, and as long
as you are, we can't do this.

71
00:03:17,388 --> 00:03:18,922
Serena.

72
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:23,259
Could our self-Imposed exile
start after tomorrow?

73
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:26,930
I can't bear the thought
of spending thanksgiving alone.

74
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:31,468
Well, i had a feeling
you might say that,

75
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,470
So i already told my mom

76
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,506
That you're making me work
at the soup kitchen all day.

77
00:03:40,344 --> 00:03:42,746
But this means
pay-Per-View movies

78
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,020
And room service at my hotel,

79
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,587
And that's it.

80
00:03:45,587 --> 00:03:48,323
I'll be good.

81
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:54,865
15 hours It's a record.

82
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:56,223
You haven't mentioned serena once.

83
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:58,850
Well, for much of that time,
i was asleep,

84
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,497
But since you're asking,

85
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,353
I've decided i'm putting her
out of my mind.

86
00:04:01,353 --> 00:04:04,586
Besides, i have a far more cunning and
deceptive adversary To deal with.

87
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:06,173
When does your mother land again?

88
00:04:06,173 --> 00:04:09,555
20 minutes. Flying in from paris
to escort me back?

89
00:04:09,555 --> 00:04:11,877
How dumb does she think i am?
She has some bomb

90
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,909
She wants to drop on me
in a controlled environment,

91
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:15,429
Surrounded by air marshals
and french people.

92
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:19,082
Amazing. Your holiday paranoia
truly knows no bounds.

93
00:04:19,082 --> 00:04:22,116
Precedence is not paranoia.
When i called daddy last night

94
00:04:22,116 --> 00:04:23,432
And started asking him
questions,

95
00:04:23,432 --> 00:04:24,982
He clammed up faster
than rihanna.

96
00:04:24,982 --> 00:04:26,503
I need to find out
my mother's secret

97
00:04:26,503 --> 00:04:29,136
Before boarding that plane.
Oh, i didn't know the empire

98
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,155
Had hourly rates.

99
00:04:31,726 --> 00:04:35,030
One van der bilt isn't enough?
I'm not having an affair
with tripp,

100
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,397
And since you're gonna
find out anyway,

101
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:38,015
He's leaving his wife,
and it's not for me.

102
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,689
Then what are you, exactly,

103
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:41,121
An 18-Year-Old,
blonde coincidence?

104
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:44,424
Call me in six months, when he
meets his next "coincidence,"

105
00:04:44,424 --> 00:04:46,693
That is, if he even leaves
his wife, which i highly doubt.

106
00:04:49,426 --> 00:04:51,043
(Nate) i told you
it would end badly.

107
00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:53,488
Threesomes, man--
Don't believe the hype.

108
00:04:53,488 --> 00:04:55,271
Yeah, but here's the thing--
Olivia said she was leaving

109
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:58,324
Because she thought that
i-I had feelings for vanessa.

110
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:00,858
Do you? 
H-How--How would i even know?

111
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:01,712
How'd olivia know?

112
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:05,122
Well, she--She said
she saw a look on my face.

113
00:05:05,122 --> 00:05:07,684
Wait. You mean...
you mean during?

114
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:12,808
(Laughs) oh, if this is not your
next story for "the new yorker,"

115
00:05:12,808 --> 00:05:15,115
I'm sending it out to
an entirely different magazine.

116
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,857
Oh, thank you. That really helps.
Oh, relax.

117
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:20,066
Chances are you're right.
It's just the threesome talking.

118
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:22,607
Exactly. Yes. Say--
Say more things like that.

119
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:24,737
Because i mean, this is--
This is just a phase.

120
00:05:24,737 --> 00:05:27,709
Okay. All right. This is good.
So you around for thanksgiving?

121
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:29,449
Uh, no, actually.

122
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:30,067
I, um...

123
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:33,723
I've been going through
some--Some mixed feelings

124
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:35,725
For someone as well,
so i called my grandfather,

125
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,697
And i think i'm gonna head out
to the estate

126
00:05:36,697 --> 00:05:39,225
And try and patch things up.
All right, well, tell him i said hello,

127
00:05:39,225 --> 00:05:41,194
And that thanks to last
year's the longest yard,

128
00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:42,463
My knee can now predict the weather.
(Elevator bell dings)

129
00:05:42,463 --> 00:05:48,387
Will do, man. Peace.
Hey. Wanna go for a walk?

130
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:57,027
Hi. Sorry. I got
in a huge fight with my mom,

131
00:05:57,027 --> 00:05:59,269
And i didn't sign the form
to stay in the dorm over break.

132
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:01,740
So could i crash with you
for a while?

133
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,453
What's with the face?

134
00:06:05,453 --> 00:06:07,667
Oh. No. (Laughs) what?

135
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,744
No, this is my, um,
my surprised, happy face.

136
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,722
Uh, make yourself at home.

137
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:20,405
Lily told us you still weren't
well enough to travel,

138
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:23,395
So we thought video chat
would, uh, be a great way

139
00:06:23,395 --> 00:06:25,316
<i>To have you at thanksgiving tomorrow.
I'm fine.</i>

140
00:06:25,316 --> 00:06:27,629
<i>Lily told me you weren't doing
anything for thanksgiving.</i>

141
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:30,772
Well, i-I mean we're not
doing anything major,

142
00:06:30,772 --> 00:06:32,955
But, uh, i'm sure after
everything you've been through,

143
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:34,952
She--She didn't want
to make you feel obligated.

144
00:06:34,952 --> 00:06:37,454
<i>(Gasps) oh.</i>

145
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:40,557
<i>Oh, how, um,
how thoughtful.</i>

146
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:42,827
<i>I'd love to be there
in person.</i>

147
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,429
<i>But let's keep it as
a surprise, shall we?</i>

148
00:06:45,463 --> 00:06:47,264
<i>(Singsong voice)
see you soon.</i>

149
00:06:47,298 --> 00:06:48,565
(Beep)

150
00:06:50,736 --> 00:06:53,337
(Cell phone ringing)

151
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,606
(Elevator bell dings)

152
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,907
(Ring)

153
00:06:56,942 --> 00:06:59,009
"Hello" is the word
you're looking for.

154
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,945
I am sorry, miss blair.

155
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:02,947
(Beep)
i not talking with vanya,

156
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:07,218
And now he not stop calling
and texting

157
00:07:07,252 --> 00:07:09,586
And tweeting
and writing on wall.

158
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:12,689
Lionel tribbey? That's
my mother's estate attorney.

159
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,925
"Please approve all changes
and return immediately."

160
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,694
She's changing her will.
I knew there was a secret.
(Elevator bell ding, doors open)

161
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,064
Darling, i'm home!
Mother!

162
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:21,698
(Clicks teeth)

163
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,801
Is that for me?

164
00:07:23,835 --> 00:07:25,236
Yes.
Mm.

165
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,238
Why don't we open it now?

166
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:28,739
No, tea first.

167
00:07:28,774 --> 00:07:32,376
I have the most amazing
lapsang souchong

168
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,379
From mariage frères.

169
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,881
(Nate) come on, serena.

170
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,383
You go off with tripp
after leaving me in a bar,

171
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,385
And then i hear through
the van der bilt grapevine

172
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,255
That... tripp's asking maureen
for a divorce.

173
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:47,658
You expect me to believe
that nothing happened?

174
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:49,960
It was one kiss,

175
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:52,930
And it was a huge mistake that
i don't intend on repeating.

176
00:07:52,964 --> 00:07:55,900
I promise.

177
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,401
Fine.

178
00:07:59,704 --> 00:08:02,639
(Cell phone rings)

179
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:03,808
(Ring)

180
00:08:03,842 --> 00:08:06,576
Can i call you back?
I have to cancel on tomorrow.

181
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,979
Maureen was a mess
when she got here.

182
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:12,683
She kept asking if
something else was going on.

183
00:08:12,717 --> 00:08:14,852
She wants to have
thanksgiving together.

184
00:08:14,886 --> 00:08:18,289
I have to go.
(Snaps cell phone shut)

185
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,594
Sorry.

186
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,199
Hey, do you have plans
for thanksgiving?

187
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:30,201
I know it's last minute.

188
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:32,203
No, i don't, actually.

189
00:08:32,237 --> 00:08:33,373
Well, how about 3:00
at my mom's?

190
00:08:33,373 --> 00:08:36,320
And please bring something
stronger than rufus' cider.
(Laughs)

191
00:08:38,844 --> 00:08:41,712
(Laughs)

192
00:08:41,746 --> 00:08:43,848
Oh.

193
00:08:43,882 --> 00:08:45,816
Oh, nice coat.

194
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:47,818
Oh, you, too. Oh, my god.

195
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:49,220
Maureen.
Lily.

196
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:52,223
Oh, i am so glad to see you.
How is d.C.?

197
00:08:52,257 --> 00:08:55,059
So much to get ready,

198
00:08:55,093 --> 00:08:57,627
But tripp insisted we spend
the holidays here.

199
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,130
Speaking of, i'd love to know
why he has my daughter

200
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,132
Working on thanksgiving.

201
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,902
She said she's volunteering
at a soup kitchen with him.

202
00:09:04,936 --> 00:09:07,238
I've never seen her work
these kinds of hours.

203
00:09:07,272 --> 00:09:10,074
Is it always like this with him? 
No. His schedule's been

204
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:12,076
Especially busy
these past few weeks.

205
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,078
This is probably
an overstep,

206
00:09:14,112 --> 00:09:16,080
But do you think
you could convince him

207
00:09:16,114 --> 00:09:18,482
To spend part of
your thanksgiving with us,

208
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,218
You know, force my daughter
to have a little family time?

209
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:24,821
<i>Uh-Oh. Looks like
someone's "small" thanksgiving</i>

210
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,491
<i>Might just have a big problem.</i>

211
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,994
Yes. Yes,
we'd--We'd love to come.

212
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,195
Great.

213
00:09:31,229 --> 00:09:34,369
<i>May the lord make us
truly thankful</i>

214
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:36,550
<i>For what we are about
to receive.</i>

215
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,862
Then she starts lecturing
the poor cashier

216
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:45,864
That thanksgiving is
nothing more

217
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:47,320
Than a corporate agenda
of the food industry

218
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,085
Masquerading
as family sentiment.

219
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:51,936
Oh, you know what? That reminds
me. Um, if my dad asks,

220
00:09:51,937 --> 00:09:54,906
We followed the homemade recipe
for his pie crust to the letter.

221
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,876
Sorry for unloading. I just
haven't had anyone to vent to

222
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,944
Since olivia left.
Have you talked to her

223
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:01,355
Since she went to do
"bitches of eastwick"?
Uh, no.

224
00:10:01,355 --> 00:10:04,455
Hey, everything happens
for a reason, right?

225
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:06,145
Yeah. Yeah, apparently.

226
00:10:06,145 --> 00:10:10,389
There it is again.

227
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:12,144
That face.

228
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,559
What? Oh, come on. There's, uh,
there's no--There's no face.

229
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:17,595
What is going on? You've been
quiet ever since i got here.
(Knock on door)

230
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,814
Who's that?
Don't--Don't hate me for this.

231
00:10:24,726 --> 00:10:26,702
I'm here. I won't hate
you, 'cause you'll be dead.

232
00:10:26,702 --> 00:10:28,764
Don't be mad at dan.
He was just trying to help.

233
00:10:28,764 --> 00:10:33,605
Look, i know
i don't do holidays well,

234
00:10:33,605 --> 00:10:35,223
But if you give me
another chance,

235
00:10:35,223 --> 00:10:36,848
I promise i can
make it up to you.

236
00:10:36,848 --> 00:10:39,125
I called rufus
on the way over here,

237
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,899
And he said we're more than
welcome to join him.

238
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:41,406
What?

239
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:45,401
We can have the thanksgiving
that you want. What do you say?

240
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:48,507
Fine

241
00:10:50,303 --> 00:10:51,813
Great. Thank you.

242
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:53,141
Make yourself at home.

243
00:10:54,724 --> 00:10:56,622
I'll give her one last shot.

244
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:59,528
If it doesn't work, consider me
moved in for the holidays.

245
00:11:14,817 --> 00:11:16,980
(Elevator bell dings)

246
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,642
Tripp,
what are you doing here?

247
00:11:21,642 --> 00:11:23,410
You wouldn't return
my calls.

248
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,631
So you're stalking me now?

249
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:30,935
Yes, serena,
i'm stalking you.

250
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,538
I thought our relationship
wasn't complicated enough,

251
00:11:33,572 --> 00:11:35,040
So...

252
00:11:35,074 --> 00:11:37,075
And get this--
Lily ran into maureen

253
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,077
And invited us
for thanksgiving,

254
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:40,578
So it looks like

255
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:43,081
We'll be spending tomorrow
together after all.

256
00:11:43,116 --> 00:11:46,118
What?
Tripp, won't that be weird?

257
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:48,520
It doesn't have to be.

258
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:51,523
And besides, now we get
to spend some time together.

259
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:53,091
(The raveonettes' "last dance"
playing)

260
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:56,861
That's all i care about--
Even with everyone else around--

261
00:11:56,896 --> 00:12:00,432
To be near you one last time.

262
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:04,269
?I rush to intensive care ?

263
00:12:04,303 --> 00:12:06,838
Why does this have
to be so hard?

264
00:12:06,872 --> 00:12:09,207
(Elevator bell dings)

265
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:12,244
We're almost to your floor.
You want me to come in?

266
00:12:14,313 --> 00:12:16,281
Yes, which is why you can't.

267
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:18,683
?If this is the last dance,
i wanna know ?

268
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:20,685
?I wanna know ?

269
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:24,389
But then again, these elevators
can take forever.

270
00:12:24,424 --> 00:12:26,824
?

271
00:12:29,895 --> 00:12:32,064
?Baby ?

272
00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:35,700
(Laughs) cyrus, enough.

273
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:37,569
Yes, enough.

274
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:40,305
I will. I will tell her.

275
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:42,574
I will. All right.
Good-Bye.

276
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:46,078
Cyrus says that he misses you
and loves you.

277
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:48,313
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
(Elevator bell dings)

278
00:12:48,347 --> 00:12:51,716
Sorry. I had to run out
before store closes.

279
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,818
I bring babka and make decaf.

280
00:12:53,852 --> 00:12:55,063
You have to be up early
for flight.

281
00:12:53,852 --> 00:12:57,983
No babka, dorota.
I have to turn in now.

282
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,926
It's 3:00 in the morning for
me. I should sleep early, too.

283
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:05,097
I agreed to work
at miss lily's tomorrow.

284
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:07,299
Big thanksgiving for them,
all the sudden,

285
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,569
But she offer me
time and a half, so...

286
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:13,871
Good night, dear.

287
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:16,808
Wait!
I have a wonderful idea.

288
00:13:16,842 --> 00:13:19,611
Why don't we spend thanksgiving
with lily and serena?

289
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:22,347
What are you talking about?

290
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:24,716
You know how much
i love thanksgiving,

291
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,518
The parade on tv.

292
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:29,787
I'm 19. Childhood memories
are slipping away already.

293
00:13:31,857 --> 00:13:34,926
Well,
let me at least call lily,

294
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,961
See if it's all right.

295
00:13:52,612 --> 00:13:56,080
I am not getting on that plane
until i know my mother's secret,

296
00:13:56,115 --> 00:13:58,683
And her secret is
in that envelope.

297
00:13:58,717 --> 00:14:01,586
What are you clutching?

298
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:05,557
Uh, miss eleanor asked me to
pick up some things for paris.

299
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:06,991
It's private.

300
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:09,394
You know what isn't?
The i.N.S. Tip line.

301
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:15,867
Oh, my god.

302
00:14:15,901 --> 00:14:19,304
That's why she's
changing her will?

303
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:22,907
My mother's pregnant.

304
00:14:29,982 --> 00:14:30,982
<i>Gratulacje.</i>

305
00:14:31,016 --> 00:14:32,184
Hey.

306
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:33,751
Yo.

307
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:40,858
I just came from a meeting
with hotel security.

308
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:44,229
Elevator cameras caught
a hotel guest

309
00:14:44,263 --> 00:14:45,697
Pulling the emergency stop

310
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:49,100
To have a make-Out session
with her boyfriend.

311
00:14:49,134 --> 00:14:52,370
(Chuckles) you just love
your job, don't you?

312
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:54,406
It was serena and tripp.

313
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:58,142
Well...

314
00:14:58,177 --> 00:15:01,079
I guess he's not leaving maureen
over "hudson hero."

315
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:03,448
Though i bet that's
what he's telling serena.

316
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:07,452
It's less messy that way,
when he bolts in six months.

317
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:08,853
Come on.

318
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:12,090
How often does the other woman
get a "happily ever after"?

319
00:15:13,992 --> 00:15:16,695
Someone needs to get through
to her before it's too late.

320
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:20,064
You know serena. Whoever tries
better bring a sledgehammer.

321
00:15:41,255 --> 00:15:44,758
?Cool yourself,
you are flush red ?

322
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:46,560
Oh, dorota.

323
00:15:46,594 --> 00:15:48,595
Happy thanksgiving.
When did you sneak in?

324
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,397
I took service elevator.

325
00:15:50,432 --> 00:15:52,433
Oh, you don't have
to do that.

326
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:55,202
Vanya's on duty. I'm sure
he'd love to see you.

327
00:15:55,236 --> 00:15:57,070
Mother.

328
00:15:57,104 --> 00:15:58,905
Surprise.
(Eric) surprise!

329
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,274
Hello, lily.

330
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:03,910
<i>This is the mystery guest?</i>

331
00:16:03,945 --> 00:16:05,646
Well, when rufus called

332
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,582
And found out that i was
feeling well enough to travel,

333
00:16:08,616 --> 00:16:10,451
We thought we'd surprise you.

334
00:16:10,485 --> 00:16:13,253
How wonderful. 
Opening the door is his job, mom.

335
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:15,255
That's why he's called
the doorman.

336
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:18,759
It's not derogatory.
Rufus, thank you again so much for inviting us.

337
00:16:18,793 --> 00:16:22,128
Uh, cece,
this is gabriela abrams

338
00:16:22,163 --> 00:16:25,265
And her daughter vanessa. This is cece, lily's mom.
Lovely to see you. Hello, daniel.

339
00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:28,502
You're looking well, cece.
I am, aren't i?

340
00:16:28,536 --> 00:16:30,838
This table is exquisite.

341
00:16:30,872 --> 00:16:33,841
Well, lily, it looks like we,
um, have a lot to talk about,

342
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,876
As do you and rufus.

343
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:41,014
What's the matter, mother?

344
00:16:41,048 --> 00:16:43,183
Is the smoked salmon
making you nauseous?

345
00:16:43,217 --> 00:16:45,853
No. No, i'm just a little
jet-Lagged. That's all.

346
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:49,423
Oh, charles, brut ros?
It's my favorite.

347
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:52,426
That's what blair said
when she suggested i pick it up.

348
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,529
Yes, mother, you simply
must have some tonight.

349
00:16:55,563 --> 00:16:57,464
I'm not in the champagne mood.

350
00:16:57,499 --> 00:16:59,032
But you love champagne.

351
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:03,136
I didn't say i didn't love it.
I said i'm not in the mood.

352
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,171
(Elevator bell dings)

353
00:17:07,642 --> 00:17:10,544
Happy thanksgiving.

354
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:13,280
You, too.
I was just telling tripp

355
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:15,716
What a pleasant surprise it was
when i ran into lily.

356
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,120
We're really appreciate
the invitation.

357
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,985
Yes, especially since
you and tripp

358
00:17:18,985 --> 00:17:20,694
Have been working
all those long hours.

359
00:17:20,694 --> 00:17:23,273
Serena's been a great help.

360
00:17:23,273 --> 00:17:26,326
You must be so proud. He has
such a strong work ethic.

361
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,361
Yes. That's him.

362
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:31,965
So where should i put my coat?

363
00:17:36,237 --> 00:17:38,204
Here. Let me take that.

364
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:41,174
Thank you.
Um...

365
00:17:45,212 --> 00:17:47,981
There's nate.
I should say hello.

366
00:17:51,352 --> 00:17:54,922
The hardest part's over.
We'll get through this. Okay?
(Elevator bell dings,
doors open)

367
00:17:54,956 --> 00:17:57,157
Serena, my dear,
happy thanksgiving.

368
00:17:57,191 --> 00:18:00,861
Thank you. I didn't know you
guys were coming, either of you.

369
00:18:00,895 --> 00:18:03,430
Surprise. Isn't this
just the best holiday?

370
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:05,899
Hello, congressman.
Where's your lovely wife?

371
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:10,871
Is it me or is my daughter just
getting crazier and crazier?

372
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:13,440
Hmm.

373
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:15,709
A little thanksgiving
proclamation--

374
00:18:15,743 --> 00:18:18,244
You two ever play grab ass
in my elevator again,

375
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:21,181
And serena will be staying
at an airport marriott.

376
00:18:21,215 --> 00:18:23,083
Happy holidays.

377
00:18:27,922 --> 00:18:29,957
Hi.

378
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:31,224
Hi.

379
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:35,796
Are tripp and serena
having an affair?

380
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,398
Nate, please.
I don't want to hurt anyone.

381
00:18:38,432 --> 00:18:41,234
I just want him back.

382
00:18:44,672 --> 00:18:47,641
I'm sorry, maureen.

383
00:18:47,675 --> 00:18:51,578
But i think i have a way we can
end it quickly and quietly.

384
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:54,347
I don't know
if you want to see this.

385
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,085
If it will end it... i do.

386
00:19:01,956 --> 00:19:05,191
(Sighs)

387
00:19:06,995 --> 00:19:08,962
Where are you dragging me?

388
00:19:08,997 --> 00:19:11,965
Haven't you ever heard of a whispered aside?
What did eric do at cotillion?

389
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,235
What do you mean? 
I mean i invited jonathan for thanksgiving,

390
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:17,237
And he texted me back,
saying he was surprised

391
00:19:17,271 --> 00:19:18,697
That eric and i were still
even friends after that night.

392
00:19:18,697 --> 00:19:21,936
Please. You, of all people, respect
a well-Thought-Out sabotage.

393
00:19:21,936 --> 00:19:23,515
Although you came
through unscathed,

394
00:19:23,515 --> 00:19:26,450
Eric's plan was solid.
Eric's plan?

395
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:28,193
Stealing your escort,
leaving you stranded

396
00:19:28,193 --> 00:19:30,209
At the top of the stairs--
It was all his idea.

397
00:19:30,354 --> 00:19:32,355
By the way, how do
you find having a sibling,

398
00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:34,369
Someone whose sole purpose
on earth is

399
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:35,752
To compete for your parents'
love and attention?

400
00:19:36,452 --> 00:19:38,008
(Rufus) uh, if everyone could
please find their seats...

401
00:19:38,008 --> 00:19:40,964
(Jason derulo and imogen heap)
?Mm, whatcha say? ?

402
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:43,967
?Mm,
that you only meant well? ?

403
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:46,223
?Well, of course you did ?

404
00:19:46,223 --> 00:19:48,165
?Mm, whatcha say? ?

405
00:19:48,165 --> 00:19:51,421
I am so happy we are sitting
next to each other, rufus.

406
00:19:53,756 --> 00:19:54,941
Excuse me.

407
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:57,551
Cece, tell me everything about
rufus and lily's wedding.

408
00:19:57,551 --> 00:19:59,261
I was boycotting
the floral industry,

409
00:19:59,261 --> 00:20:01,800
Or i would have been there myself.
Tragically, i wasn't invited.

410
00:20:03,617 --> 00:20:06,252
Apparently my son-In-Law felt
it better if i didn't attend.

411
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:09,157
Mom, it's none of your business.
You--You didn't want lily's own mother at your wedding?

412
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:11,392
<i>Fifth wedding. But still.</i>

413
00:20:11,525 --> 00:20:14,628
Lily told me you were still too sick to travel.
Thank you, but, i mean,

414
00:20:14,662 --> 00:20:18,331
I've been in remission since the middle of august.
But lily didn't come home till october.

415
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:20,734
?When the roof caved in
and the truth came out ?

416
00:20:20,768 --> 00:20:24,304
Oh. Perhaps i'm--I'm--I'm wrong.
It's hard to keep track.

417
00:20:24,338 --> 00:20:25,672
(Laughs) wine?

418
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:27,674
?We'll be living so large ?

419
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:30,510
?I'll do anything for you ?

420
00:20:30,544 --> 00:20:34,314
?So tell me, girl ?
?Mm, whatcha say? ?

421
00:20:34,348 --> 00:20:35,732
(Lowered voice) why does my mom
have to stick her nose

422
00:20:35,732 --> 00:20:36,754
Into everyone's business? 

423
00:20:36,754 --> 00:20:38,588
Oh, come on. Cece's heart pumps secrets and gin.

424
00:20:38,588 --> 00:20:39,983
It's not--It's not your mom's fault.

425
00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:42,076
You've been defending her
all day and ignoring me.

426
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:43,210
What's going on with you?

427
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:47,883
And you're making that face again. 
No. All right, look, this is getting ridiculous.

428
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:48,863
(Vanessa) jenny, have you
ever heard of someone

429
00:20:48,863 --> 00:20:53,240
Starting to make a brand-New face at 19?
I don't know. Ask eric. He's mastered 2.

430
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,244
Excuse me?
Blair told me you were responsible

431
00:20:56,244 --> 00:20:57,797
For sabotaging me
at cotillion.

432
00:20:57,797 --> 00:21:01,182
What, you don't have
anything to say to me?

433
00:21:02,576 --> 00:21:04,745
Your sweet potatoes
are bland.

434
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:07,047
?Mm, whatcha say? ?

435
00:21:07,081 --> 00:21:10,517
?Mm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did ?

436
00:21:10,551 --> 00:21:13,586
?Mm, whatcha say? ?
?Whatcha say? Whatcha say? ?

437
00:21:13,621 --> 00:21:16,356
?Mm,
that it's all for the best ?

438
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,358
?Because it is ?

439
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:19,926
?Mm, what you say? ?

440
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:23,263
?Mm, that you
only meant well? ?

441
00:21:23,297 --> 00:21:26,432
Mother, here's some camembert
from artisanal.

442
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:30,236
It's unpasteurized. Don't you want some?
That's enough. What has gotten into you?

443
00:21:30,271 --> 00:21:31,938
<i>Into me?</i>

444
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:34,307
Try you. You're the one
who's pregnant.

445
00:21:34,341 --> 00:21:36,409
?Knowing that i let
our love go ?

446
00:21:36,443 --> 00:21:37,778
(Glass clinks)

447
00:21:37,812 --> 00:21:40,634
Lily and i would like
to thank you all

448
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,456
For coming to our first
thanksgiving as a family.

449
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,952
Now before she gets back,
i'd like to tell you a joke

450
00:21:45,987 --> 00:21:48,889
That i tell every year, which
lily has expressly forbidden.

451
00:21:48,923 --> 00:21:50,563
A group of pilgrims
decide to start a band...

452
00:21:52,795 --> 00:21:55,354
How can you two sit there,
smiling?

453
00:21:55,354 --> 00:21:58,451
After several of the prominent elders...
don't you have any sense of decency?

454
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:01,669
Maureen--
No, not one second more.

455
00:22:01,703 --> 00:22:03,065
(Rufus) the young pilgrim
says, "can i try?"

456
00:22:03,065 --> 00:22:04,643
Tripp and i are going to
grow old together,

457
00:22:04,643 --> 00:22:06,067
Without you.

458
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:10,342
Or i make my own statement.
Where did you get that?

459
00:22:10,342 --> 00:22:13,247
(Sighs)
(rufus) ...blow them all away,
in a--In a style...

460
00:22:13,281 --> 00:22:17,298
He'll be a political joke,
and you'll be a punch line.

461
00:22:17,298 --> 00:22:19,545
Your affair ends now.

462
00:22:19,545 --> 00:22:22,623
When he's done, one
of the older pilgrims says...
serena.

463
00:22:22,657 --> 00:22:24,412
And he says, "that's what
i call plymouth rock!"

464
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:26,627
?'Cause things ain't right ?

465
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:29,330
?'Cause when the roof caved in
and the truth came out ?

466
00:22:29,364 --> 00:22:33,033
?I just didn't know what to do ?
?I just didn't know what to do ?

467
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:35,502
?But when i become a star,
we'll be living so large ?

468
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:37,771
You know what?
Why don't we just eat?

469
00:22:37,805 --> 00:22:40,474
I lost my appetite.
?Baby, whatcha say? ?

470
00:22:40,508 --> 00:22:43,944
?Mm, whatcha say? ?
And i want pie.

471
00:22:43,978 --> 00:22:46,614
?Mm,
that you only meant well? ?

472
00:22:46,648 --> 00:22:48,805
?Well, of course you did,
mm, whatcha say? ?

473
00:22:49,928 --> 00:22:50,496
Kids.

474
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:53,327
Oh, and what makes you
an expert?

475
00:22:53,755 --> 00:22:55,623
?Mm, whatcha say? ?

476
00:22:55,657 --> 00:22:59,893
?Mm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did ?

477
00:22:59,927 --> 00:23:02,463
I'm so glad you invited me,
rufus.

478
00:23:02,497 --> 00:23:03,797
Cheers.

479
00:23:03,831 --> 00:23:06,933
?What--What--What--
What did you say? ?

480
00:23:13,422 --> 00:23:15,520
Mom, i can explain.
It's not what it looks like.

481
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:18,627
So you're not having an affair
with a married man?

482
00:23:18,662 --> 00:23:21,630
No, i'm--I'm--I'm not having an affair.
I saw you kissing him, serena.

483
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:23,632
A kiss that
we didn't even have

484
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:26,202
Until after he decided
to leave his wife.

485
00:23:26,236 --> 00:23:30,173
Do you know what it feels like
to be left? Because i do.

486
00:23:30,207 --> 00:23:32,442
Well, it isn't like it was
with you.

487
00:23:32,476 --> 00:23:35,211
Tripp actually cares
about me.

488
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:36,946
Oh, you think so?

489
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,949
Well, why don't you take a look
at what he's doing?

490
00:23:39,983 --> 00:23:41,951
Leaving someone who,
up until today,

491
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:45,121
Thought the exact same thing.

492
00:23:45,155 --> 00:23:46,622
Walk away, serena.

493
00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:51,327
Until you do, you're not
welcome in this home.

494
00:24:02,372 --> 00:24:04,340
So i don't get it.
You hate me,

495
00:24:04,374 --> 00:24:06,495
But you've been pretending to be
my friend this entire time?

496
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,037
That's pretty much it, yeah.

497
00:24:08,037 --> 00:24:11,180
Why wouldn't you just tell me
you were mad?

498
00:24:11,215 --> 00:24:13,182
At least then
we could fight about it.

499
00:24:13,217 --> 00:24:15,184
No, you lost
any rights to honesty

500
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:17,595
When you chose being queen
over our friendship.

501
00:24:17,854 --> 00:24:18,740
That's not what happened.

502
00:24:18,855 --> 00:24:19,983
Every time
you did something bad,

503
00:24:19,983 --> 00:24:22,119
I defended you to jonathan.
He got sick of me

504
00:24:22,193 --> 00:24:24,094
Making excuses for you
all the time,

505
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,692
So i decided to try to beat you
at your own game.

506
00:24:25,692 --> 00:24:27,682
That was a mistake.

507
00:24:27,682 --> 00:24:29,166
I figured if i could
take you down just once,

508
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,236
So you could know how it feels
to be the one getting egged,

509
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,238
Then maybe you'd realize
what you'd become,

510
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,562
And everything could go back
to the way it was.

511
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,131
And you lost jonathan
because of it.

512
00:24:41,131 --> 00:24:43,782
I lost everything.

513
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:44,843
Not me.

514
00:24:44,843 --> 00:24:47,745
Not if you apologize.
You say that now,

515
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,283
But you've bec  ome
a totally different person,

516
00:24:49,283 --> 00:24:52,170
And as a result, so have i.
Apparently i became someone

517
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,750
That jonathan no longer wanted
to be with,

518
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,857
And for that, i blame you.

519
00:24:55,226 --> 00:24:58,563
You told kira
she had to watch her back.

520
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,932
Well, now you have
to watch yours.

521
00:25:07,623 --> 00:25:09,266
There you are.

522
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:12,859
Mother, how could you?

523
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:14,929
No offense to cyrus,

524
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:16,947
But do you think the world
really needs another aaron rose?

525
00:25:16,947 --> 00:25:21,685
Blair, you are completely off base.
Thanksgiving always has secrets.

526
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:23,720
And in your case,
it's a miracle.

527
00:25:23,754 --> 00:25:26,590
I am not pregnant.

528
00:25:26,624 --> 00:25:30,961
I did come back to change my
will to reflect my new property.

529
00:25:30,995 --> 00:25:33,597
Cyrus and i are moving
to paris full time.

530
00:25:33,631 --> 00:25:36,366
But you love new york.

531
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,068
You always said anyone
who lives anywhere else

532
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:41,070
Is fooling themselves.

533
00:25:41,105 --> 00:25:43,373
Perhaps it's time for me
to step back

534
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:45,542
And let you make manhattan
your own.

535
00:25:47,478 --> 00:25:50,847
Besides, cyrus and i did find
a lovely penthouse flat

536
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,849
On the ile st.-Louis,

537
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,851
Right across from
your favorite restaurant.

538
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,953
Rôtisserie du beaujolais?
Mm.

539
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,823
Oh, that poulet rôti is
reason enough to move.

540
00:25:59,857 --> 00:26:01,290
(Laughs)

541
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:04,027
Mother...

542
00:26:04,061 --> 00:26:05,996
I'm sorry

543
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,097
For being so crazy.

544
00:26:08,132 --> 00:26:09,799
You pregnant?

545
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,300
I mean, come on.

546
00:26:11,335 --> 00:26:14,538
We both know you closed
for business a long time ago.

547
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:17,607
But then whose test was it?
Test?

548
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:19,809
Miss waldorfs...

549
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:21,344
I know dorota's upstairs.

550
00:26:21,378 --> 00:26:23,346
She won't return my calls.

551
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,783
Please, tell her
whatever i did, i am sorry.

552
00:26:26,817 --> 00:26:30,787
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

553
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:32,288
I'll be honest.

554
00:26:32,322 --> 00:26:34,658
This isn't the thanksgiving
i had hoped for.

555
00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:37,861
Look, i don't--I don't mean
to be presumptuous,

556
00:26:37,895 --> 00:26:39,863
But don't you think
it's a little odd

557
00:26:39,897 --> 00:26:42,032
That lily didn't
tell you the truth

558
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:44,034
About when her mother
went into remission?

559
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:46,870
I trust lily. When she's ready
to explain, she will.

560
00:26:46,904 --> 00:26:48,872
Yes. Yes, but--

561
00:26:48,906 --> 00:26:53,109
You know, i think i need
more whipped cream.

562
00:26:53,143 --> 00:26:54,878
What is wrong with you?

563
00:26:54,912 --> 00:26:57,346
I care about rufus.
I was being honest.

564
00:26:57,381 --> 00:26:59,849
Just like you being honest when
i laid out my entire paycheck

565
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:02,852
To get us tickets to see "hair,"
and you told me

566
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:06,155
You'd rather spend the whole
show talking to a homeless man?
He was a vet.

567
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,692
This is who i am.

568
00:27:08,726 --> 00:27:10,193
I care about people.

569
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:14,631
You know, um,
it's thanksgiving.

570
00:27:14,665 --> 00:27:17,901
Yeah. I'm starting to think
this was a mistake.

571
00:27:17,935 --> 00:27:19,636
Maybe i should go.

572
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,606
For once, mom, i agree.

573
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:28,211
Gabriela--Mm.

574
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,324
I'm sorry.

575
00:27:41,358 --> 00:27:43,727
I could only imagine
what you're feeling.

576
00:27:43,761 --> 00:27:48,164
What we did--
What i did was wrong.

577
00:27:48,198 --> 00:27:50,166
I never meant to hurt anyone,

578
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,369
And--And i hurt you.

579
00:27:53,403 --> 00:27:56,539
I promise
i'll never see tripp again.

580
00:28:11,237 --> 00:28:12,942
What are you doing in here?

581
00:28:15,008 --> 00:28:16,975
I wanted to go to my room,

582
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:21,079
But then i forgot
it's not my room anymore.

583
00:28:21,114 --> 00:28:22,714
What do you want?

584
00:28:25,118 --> 00:28:28,753
Chuck told me what happened.
You did the right thing.

585
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:32,357
Then why do i feel so bad?

586
00:28:32,391 --> 00:28:34,960
Doing the right thing takes
courage and strength.

587
00:28:34,994 --> 00:28:37,696
At least,
that's what i've heard.

588
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,798
(Chuckles)

589
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:42,334
And anything that hard is
only made more difficult

590
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,503
By not having your best friend
by your side.

591
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:48,207
I'm sorry you had
to go through it alone.

592
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:50,275
I'm sorry, too,

593
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:53,145
For everything.

594
00:28:55,514 --> 00:28:57,482
What are you doing
this weekend?

595
00:28:57,516 --> 00:29:01,220
Eating leftovers and feeling horrible.
No, you're coming to paris.

596
00:29:01,254 --> 00:29:04,189
What? I am?
My mom and i are catching the red-Eye tonight.

597
00:29:04,224 --> 00:29:07,292
If you're gonna be sad, you
might as well be sad in paris.

598
00:29:07,327 --> 00:29:10,028
Chuck can shop for sweaters
with harold and roman,

599
00:29:10,063 --> 00:29:12,530
And we can wander notre dame,
and spend time,

600
00:29:12,565 --> 00:29:16,668
Just the two of us,
like we haven't for so long.

601
00:29:16,702 --> 00:29:18,337
Is your passport here?

602
00:29:18,371 --> 00:29:20,239
In the safe upstairs.

603
00:29:20,273 --> 00:29:23,108
(Laughs) then you're ready
to go!

604
00:29:23,142 --> 00:29:24,809
<i>Come on. Allons-Y.</i>

605
00:29:24,844 --> 00:29:25,944
(Laughs)

606
00:29:32,418 --> 00:29:36,654
Oh. I'm sorry.
I missed thanksgiving.

607
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:38,156
There's still dessert.

608
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:40,292
You're wonderful.

609
00:29:45,064 --> 00:29:48,033
Why did you stay with cece
after she got better

610
00:29:48,067 --> 00:29:50,402
Instead of coming home to me?

611
00:29:52,038 --> 00:29:55,007
Well, um, my mother and i
were finally connecting.

612
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:57,009
I think,
faced with her illness,

613
00:29:57,043 --> 00:30:00,412
She--She became a different
person. She was loving and kind.

614
00:30:00,446 --> 00:30:03,081
And i wanted to stay
and enjoy this person

615
00:30:03,116 --> 00:30:06,118
For as long as i could.
You could have told me that.

616
00:30:06,152 --> 00:30:08,520
I know,
and i should have, but i...

617
00:30:08,554 --> 00:30:10,522
I knew it wa

618
00:30:10,556 --> 00:30:12,857
Leaving you here, in charge
of the kids and everything,

619
00:30:12,892 --> 00:30:15,060
And, um, so i lied.

620
00:30:15,094 --> 00:30:18,297
And then i just continued to lie
to cover it up.

621
00:30:18,331 --> 00:30:20,799
So that's it then?

622
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:24,136
You love me so much
you couldn't let me go?

623
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,371
Well, you weren't supposed to
hear that, mother.

624
00:30:26,406 --> 00:30:27,872
I'm glad i did.

625
00:30:27,907 --> 00:30:29,874
I now have a witness

626
00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:33,078
If she ever tries to tell me
how insufferable i am.

627
00:30:33,112 --> 00:30:36,982
I'm gonna go clear the table.

628
00:30:37,016 --> 00:30:38,550
(Sighs)

629
00:30:38,584 --> 00:30:41,219
Thank you, mother.

630
00:30:41,254 --> 00:30:43,721
So i take it
you didn't tell him

631
00:30:43,756 --> 00:30:46,791
About your little trip
this summer?

632
00:30:46,826 --> 00:30:49,127
No, and i'd like
to keep it that way.

633
00:30:49,162 --> 00:30:51,263
When will you learn, my love,

634
00:30:51,297 --> 00:30:54,833
That some secrets
can't stay hidden?

635
00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:58,437
Well, this one will.

636
00:30:58,471 --> 00:31:00,738
Let's hope so.

637
00:31:06,612 --> 00:31:08,613
(Gasps) no, no, no.
I-I eat later.

638
00:31:08,647 --> 00:31:11,183
This isn't for you.
It's for vanya.

639
00:31:11,217 --> 00:31:14,353
Tom colicchio live in building.
I'm sure he sent plate already.

640
00:31:14,387 --> 00:31:16,355
Mr. Rufus good cook,
but not top chef.

641
00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:19,224
Hmm.
This plate is
the plate he wants.

642
00:31:19,258 --> 00:31:22,327
Oh. You are going to have
to talk to him eventually.

643
00:31:22,362 --> 00:31:24,847
Not for two or three months at least.
Dorota--

644
00:31:24,847 --> 00:31:26,241
You not understand.
We not married.

645
00:31:26,241 --> 00:31:28,403
My parents start
next polish-Soviet war.

646
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:30,619
Russia once again not victor,
believe me.

647
00:31:31,971 --> 00:31:33,472
Good luck.

648
00:31:33,506 --> 00:31:35,073
Good luck.
I-I don't want to do this!

649
00:31:40,846 --> 00:31:44,649
Well, i guess it's a good thing
you travel light.

650
00:31:44,683 --> 00:31:46,651
Look, i-I appreciate
your concern, dan.

651
00:31:49,906 --> 00:31:49,906
I do, but it's a waste of time.
We're--We're too far apart.

652
00:31:49,906 --> 00:31:52,040
Well, y-You're not as different
as you think.

653
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,002
Did you know she petitioned
to keep a historic bar

654
00:31:54,002 --> 00:31:55,489
From closing in brooklyn
last year?

655
00:31:55,396 --> 00:31:56,683
And she spent
the end of the summer

656
00:31:56,532 --> 00:31:58,800
Rebuilding community gardens
in alphabet city.

657
00:32:01,236 --> 00:32:03,494
She loves you. She does.
I think she just wishes

658
00:32:03,569 --> 00:32:05,004
You'd spend half the time
on her

659
00:32:04,939 --> 00:32:07,038
That you do on these people
you don't even know.

660
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:10,565
And when you do, trust me,
i-I really think you'll see

661
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:12,891
How, uh, how amazing she is.

662
00:32:19,051 --> 00:32:22,687
I-I-I-I can't believe
i didn't see this till now.

663
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:26,191
Mm, what?
Oh, you're in love with her.

664
00:32:26,225 --> 00:32:28,860
It's all over your face.
No. (Laughs)

665
00:32:28,894 --> 00:32:31,829
No. That's, um...

666
00:32:31,864 --> 00:32:33,598
Yeah.

667
00:32:40,373 --> 00:32:43,341
I'll, uh, i'll let you guys
be alone.

668
00:32:56,822 --> 00:32:59,157
I can't believe what you did.

669
00:32:59,192 --> 00:33:01,626
You had a choice, tripp.

670
00:33:01,661 --> 00:33:03,628
Seems like you made it.
What do you mean?

671
00:33:03,663 --> 00:33:06,198
Now thanks to you, maureen
can cause a huge scandal.

672
00:33:06,232 --> 00:33:07,899
I lose everything.

673
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:11,069
No, you lose your career. Tripp,
you've already lost serena.

674
00:33:11,103 --> 00:33:13,505
The fact that this is
just now occurring to you

675
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:14,965
Makes me pretty sure
i did the right thing.

676
00:33:23,237 --> 00:33:26,351
Why didn't you tell him the truth?
That is the truth. Okay, serena deserves

677
00:33:26,385 --> 00:33:29,053
Someone who would sacrifice
anything to be with her.

678
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,556
Even if that means
stealing a security tape

679
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:35,159
From his best friend's
business?

680
00:33:35,194 --> 00:33:39,364
Tell her how you feel.

681
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:40,865
Give her a chance

682
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:43,801
To be with a guy
who does deserve her.

683
00:33:48,574 --> 00:33:51,576
(Strums note)

684
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:56,548
Gibson guitar,

685
00:33:56,582 --> 00:33:59,317
Vinyl collection...

686
00:33:59,352 --> 00:34:01,686
I guess this really isn't
bart's office anymore.

687
00:34:01,721 --> 00:34:03,688
(Beep)
yeah, except i'm sure my mom

688
00:34:03,723 --> 00:34:06,591
Hasn't given rufus
the combo to the safe yet.
(Beep)

689
00:34:06,626 --> 00:34:09,594
Well, now that bart's not around
to keep files on everybody,

690
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:14,633
Maybe you guys don't
need one.

691
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:17,235
What are you still doing here?
I couldn't leave.

692
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,745
I could help you out with that.
The elevator comes,

693
00:34:18,745 --> 00:34:21,672
You get on it, and we never see you again.
I don't care if maureen outs our affair.

694
00:34:21,672 --> 00:34:23,681
I don't care if they run
me out of congress for it.

695
00:34:23,681 --> 00:34:29,257
All i care about... is you.
If i'm gonna leave maureen,

696
00:34:29,257 --> 00:34:33,373
Which...
i just told her i am...

697
00:34:35,853 --> 00:34:38,855
I want to do it
with you by my side.

698
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,096
I'm gonna be downstairs,
waiting in my car, to go.

699
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,200
I hope you'll join me.

700
00:34:54,105 --> 00:34:57,341
Wow. I didn't think
he had it in him.

701
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:59,242
What do i do?

702
00:35:02,814 --> 00:35:03,947
Go.

703
00:35:06,851 --> 00:35:09,019
I love you.

704
00:35:09,053 --> 00:35:11,488
I love you, too.

705
00:35:17,128 --> 00:35:19,563
What is that?

706
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:22,833
It's from my father.

707
00:35:24,803 --> 00:35:28,138
It's postmarked from weeks ago,
and it's been opened.

708
00:35:28,172 --> 00:35:30,374
(Eleanor) blair, we have to go.

709
00:35:30,408 --> 00:35:33,344
(Whispers) go. It's okay.
I need to be alone.

710
00:35:46,991 --> 00:35:49,893
Where are you going?
Tripp and his wife have left,

711
00:35:49,927 --> 00:35:52,832
And you, um, you did the right thing.
Actually, tripp is divorcing maureen.

712
00:35:52,832 --> 00:35:55,733
He's waiting for me downstairs.
We're going away together.

713
00:35:55,768 --> 00:35:57,535
I thought we understood
each other, serena.

714
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,537
We do. I'm not welcome
in your home, so...

715
00:36:01,137 --> 00:36:04,175
You're still responsible
for breaking up his marriage.

716
00:36:04,209 --> 00:36:07,645
Don't go through with this.
It is a huge mistake,

717
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,648
One that you will regret
for the rest of your life.

718
00:36:10,683 --> 00:36:13,084
You want to talk to me
about mistakes?

719
00:36:16,922 --> 00:36:19,858
You don't get to judge me...

720
00:36:19,892 --> 00:36:21,306
Ever again.

721
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:29,668
After the yelling died down,
i thought i'd take a chance

722
00:36:29,702 --> 00:36:31,703
You might be ready
for some pie and coffee.

723
00:36:31,738 --> 00:36:33,705
Well, my daughter and i had

724
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,741
Our first hear-To-Heart talk
in--In ever.

725
00:36:35,775 --> 00:36:37,370
(Laughs) and thank you.

726
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,105
Of course.

727
00:36:38,105 --> 00:36:40,105
It's all because of you.
But don't worry.

728
00:36:40,105 --> 00:36:42,305
We're gonna move to a hotel
for the rest of the weekend.

729
00:36:42,305 --> 00:36:44,484
Oh, you--You don't have
to leave.

730
00:36:44,484 --> 00:36:46,618
I mean, you're welcome to stay,
uh, as long as you like.

731
00:36:48,154 --> 00:36:48,861
Okay.

732
00:36:49,589 --> 00:36:50,587
About what i said before--

733
00:36:50,587 --> 00:36:53,001
You gave me some great advice.
I'm going to return the favor.

734
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:57,067
When vanessa told you her
feelings all those years ago,

735
00:36:57,067 --> 00:36:59,149
You broke her heart,

736
00:36:59,149 --> 00:37:02,070
And your friendship
almost didn't recover.

737
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,369
So unless you're sure

738
00:37:04,403 --> 00:37:06,185
That my daughter is
who you want to be with,

739
00:37:06,185 --> 00:37:08,649
I suggest you keep your feelings
to yourself.

740
00:37:10,243 --> 00:37:13,479
Because if you break her heart
this time,

741
00:37:13,513 --> 00:37:16,147
Your friendship won't survive.

742
00:37:16,182 --> 00:37:18,149
And that would be a tragedy,

743
00:37:18,184 --> 00:37:20,452
Because you are
a great friend for her.

744
00:37:20,487 --> 00:37:22,521
Thank you.

745
00:37:22,555 --> 00:37:25,524
Hey, mom. Paul hoffman,
that guy that i told you about--

746
00:37:25,558 --> 00:37:26,839
He just texted me,
and his parents are in town.

747
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:28,990
He wants to meet for a drink.
Do you want to go?

748
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:32,232
I don't know. Dan, do i?

749
00:37:36,469 --> 00:37:38,837
Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I--She likes him a lot.

750
00:37:38,871 --> 00:37:41,674
I think you should meet him.

751
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:42,941
Great.

752
00:37:42,975 --> 00:37:44,943
All right. Let's do it.

753
00:37:44,977 --> 00:37:46,512
Yay!

754
00:37:51,017 --> 00:37:52,484
(Horn honks)

755
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,552
Serena!

756
00:37:53,587 --> 00:37:56,422
Excuse me if i didn't say good-Bye,

757
00:37:56,456 --> 00:37:58,957
But after what you did--
Don't go.

758
00:37:58,991 --> 00:38:01,860
What?
Don't go with tripp.

759
00:38:01,894 --> 00:38:04,062
Nate. 
Okay, i know what i did was wrong,

760
00:38:04,097 --> 00:38:09,368
And i'm sorry.
I just--I did it because...

761
00:38:09,402 --> 00:38:12,804
'Cause ever since last week,

762
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:16,508
Ever since three years ago
when you left...

763
00:38:16,543 --> 00:38:18,977
Please don't get in the car.

764
00:38:20,947 --> 00:38:23,616
Just stay here with me.

765
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:26,385
Just give me a chance.

766
00:38:26,419 --> 00:38:28,587
Serena.

767
00:38:28,622 --> 00:38:30,256
You coming?

768
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,459
(Paramore's "the only exception"
playing)

769
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,190
You'll come visit us in vermont?

770
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:49,607
I will.

771
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:54,614
Thanks for everything.

772
00:38:55,649 --> 00:38:57,817
<i>Another thanksgiving
has come and gone...</i>

773
00:38:57,852 --> 00:38:59,986
You know what?

774
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:03,089
I like your new face.
(Chuckles)

775
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:06,158
<i>(Chuckles) it's cute.
And what am im most thankful for?</i>

776
00:39:06,193 --> 00:39:07,827
<i>The truth.</i>

777
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:12,532
<i>Sometimes it's the truth
you've been trying not to face</i>

778
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:15,935
<i>Or the truth that will change
your life...</i>

779
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:19,806
?And we've got to find
other ways ?

780
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,475
?To make it alone ?

781
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:25,311
?Keep a straight face ?

782
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:30,082
?And i've always lived
like this ?

783
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:33,319
?Keeping a comfortable... ?

784
00:39:33,353 --> 00:39:37,256
<i>Sometimes it's the truth
that's a long time coming...</i>

785
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:40,793
?And up until now
i had sworn to myself ?

786
00:39:40,828 --> 00:39:43,563
?That i'm content ?

787
00:39:43,597 --> 00:39:48,001
<i>Or the truth you prayed would
never see the light of day.</i>

788
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:49,368
Lil?

789
00:39:51,572 --> 00:39:53,873
Lily, have you seen
the other wedding album?

790
00:39:53,908 --> 00:39:55,414
I want to show cece
the pictures

791
00:39:55,414 --> 00:39:57,500
Of me jamming with kim and thurston.
Oh. Um...

792
00:39:58,135 --> 00:40:03,215
You okay?
Oh, yes, everything's fine.
Um, i'll grab it.

793
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:12,191
?You are the only exception ?

794
00:40:12,225 --> 00:40:14,226
Hey, do you mind if i stay?

795
00:40:18,098 --> 00:40:19,999
Yes.

796
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:22,201
But that's why i love you.

797
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:28,274
(Sighs)

798
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,178
Come on.

799
00:40:32,212 --> 00:40:34,781
Let's go get drunk.

800
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:39,752

the way we hoped they would.</i>

(Speaks indistinctly)

802
00:40:41,555 --> 00:40:46,626
<i>But they linger long
after they've been said.</i>

803
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:51,297
?Leave me with some kind
of proof it's not a dream ?

804
00:40:51,331 --> 00:40:57,570
?Oh ?

805
00:40:57,605 --> 00:41:02,208
?You are the only exception ?

806
00:41:02,242 --> 00:41:05,411
?You are the only exception ?

807
00:41:06,145 --> 00:41:08,647
Oh, i didn't see you,
miss van der bilt.

808
00:41:08,682 --> 00:41:11,450
Sorry, dorota.
I forgot my coat.

809
00:41:11,484 --> 00:41:13,952
It's been kind of
a crazy night.

810
00:41:13,986 --> 00:41:17,055
Please tell lily and rufus
everything was wonderful.

811
00:41:17,089 --> 00:41:23,895
?And i'm on my way
to believing ?

812
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:26,865
<i>But the kind of truth
i'm most thankful for--</i>
