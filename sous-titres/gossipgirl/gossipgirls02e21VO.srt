00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Gossip girl here.
Your one and only source

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,640
<i>Into the scandalous lives
of manhattan's elite.</i>

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,330
No. Stop.Quiet.

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,210
Hey! Jenny!

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,400
Sarah lawrence cannot accept
someone who has hazed a teacher.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,230
Colleges stopped accepting
applications months ago.

7
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,010
I don't have any other options. What
happened? Yale has great financial aid.

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,810
Well,as of now, we're a low priority.

9
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,610
It's all determined by
need. We're not needy enough?

10
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,970
It sounds to me like you need
to get away. Yes! Road trip.

11
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,210
I was thinking more like a private
jet to spain. When do we leave?

12
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,010
Tomorrow morning. To españa!

13
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,430
To españa! I met you last year.
You were calling yourself savannah.

14
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,810
It's serena. It's nice to
meet you again. I'm gabriel.

15
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,520
All i want to tell you is
that i do want to be with you.

16
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,970
<i>And who am i?</i>

17
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,710
<i>That's a secret i'll never tell.</i>

18
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,150
<i>You know you love me.</i>

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,150
<i>X.O.X.O.,gossip girl.</i>

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,610
(Cockney accent) excuse me,sir.

21
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,730
Buy a flower for the pretty lady?

22
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,880
You!

23
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,000
(British accent) darling,who
let this miserable creature in?

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,590
Please,i'm tryin' to earn
money so i can go to yale.

25
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,340
It's my dream,it is, always has been.

26
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,500
Yale? You foolish little girl.

27
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,360
That dream is over. Time to wake up.

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,610
No. No.

29
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,340
No! No!

30
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,230
This is my dream. No!

31
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,180
<i>When you lose hope in a dream,</i>

32
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,420
<i>Sometimes all you're left
with are sleepless nights.</i>

33
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,320
<i>While some call the doctor for a refill,</i>

34
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,650
<i>I find the best solution</i>

35
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,950
<i>Is a full social calendar.</i>

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,230
And here nate and i are
at the young fellows ball.

37
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,840
And here we are with his
grandfather, william van der bilt.

38
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,080
Cyrus,focus. You missed
a lot while you were gone.

39
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,650
I'm sorry,but i have
an enormous amount to do

40
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,190
Before the passover
supper tonight--The seder.

41
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,970
Oh,it smells delicious.

42
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,200
Oh,i am making a brisket that
is gonna blow your socks off.

43
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,050
Be sure to save me some.

44
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,330
For the last time,

45
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,070
This dinner is very important
to your stepfather and me.

46
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,490
And if only i could be
two people,but you know,

47
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,420
Nate's cousin tripp van der
bilt is getting married tomorrow.

48
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,820
The dinner's tonight, and
i'm late for the rehearsal.

49
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,470
Rehearsal? You're not
even in the wedding.

50
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,630
No,but nate texted me, and
he said he had a surprise.

51
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,350
I'm betting it's about the junior committee for
the whitney. Tripp's fiancée promised to get me on.

52
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,530
Okay,just wait a minute.

53
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,560
Young lady,you are gonna have to get
serious about your future. Maureen is already

54
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,320
On the board of four
charities and two museums

55
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,870
And needs a personal assistant
to keep track of her schedule.

56
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,610
Not to mention,

57
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,000
Being a socialite was
good enough for jackie o.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,670
You know,my old friend,j.R.,
is a big mugwump at n.Y.U.,

59
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,650
And he happens to owe me a favor.

60
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,390
Cyrus saved j.R.'S life in 'nam.

61
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:03,060
Oh. (Chuckles) well,i'm sorry,
but just because i lost yale

62
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,560
Does not mean i'm wasting
my time at a non-Ivy,

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,840
Reading "beloved" six times and
experimenting with lesbianism.

64
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,800
Now nate is waiting.

65
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,120
Waldorf women are not socialites.

66
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,860
You can just set those
down there,please.

67
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,310
The prodigal daughter returns.

68
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,210
How was spain?

69
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,220
Amazing. Perfect.

70
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,200
I'm sure.

71
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,990
You and poppy dancing on
tabletops in barcelona,

72
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,540
Sunbathing nude in costa del sol.

73
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,420
More like me and poppy and her
boyfriend gabriel on the coast.

74
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,870
Uh,i just read and
ate and,you know,swam.

75
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,030
So there was nude sunbathing.

76
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,600
Hey,uh,is my mom around?

77
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,680
I haven't seen her, but
i have been occupied.

78
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,370
Last night's entertainment.

79
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,440
She's a synchronized swimmer,

80
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,890
Can hold her breath for five minutes.

81
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,780
So you--You found a way
to get over blair then.

82
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,030
Well,there was a detour
with a boho barista.

83
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,600
Then i realized i'm a 17-Year-Old
billionaire with tremendous stamina.

84
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,880
Tonight i have a date with
the bolshoi's lead ballerina.

85
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,220
By the way, i saw poppy lifton
at the rose bar last week.

86
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,720
It's funny how she can be there
yet still be in spain with you.

87
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,030
Did i tell you you look beautiful?

88
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,820
Nate archibald, are you trying
to seduce me on church property?

89
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,160
Mm. Come on. Let's go.

90
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,470
And can you please remind the attendants
not to seat me behind caroline kennedy?

91
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,490
She may be american royalty,
but that woman is a giraffe.

92
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:52,860
(Chuckles) sure.

93
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,780
Oh,hey. Tripp asked me
to go to lunch with him.

94
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,760
He said it was important, but i think he's just scared
i'm gonna talk about his ex-Girlfriends during my toast.

95
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,540
Fine. I'll come by before dinner.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,960
I-I hope that's not your big surprise.

97
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,230
Oh,yeah. I'll have to think
of a way to thank maureen,

98
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,250
With the whitney committee.
I got into columbia.

99
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,680
What? I got into columbia.
What were you talking about?

100
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,410
Oh. Nothing.

101
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,070
That's amazing. I didn't
even know you applied.

102
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,770
Well,i just--I wanted to see if i could
get in without any family help, you know.

103
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,830
I mean,all my grandfather
had to do to get me into yale

104
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:29,120
Was just make a phone
call and... i'm sorry.

105
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:30,700
It's fine.

106
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,820
I'm so happy for you.

107
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,890
So that means no yale?

108
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,770
No,honestly,i'm--I'm
torn.

109
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,670
Blair. It was so sweet of you to come.

110
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,240
Yes,it-It's going to be so beautiful.

111
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,160
I-I have some disappointing news.

112
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,590
The whitney junior committee felt
you were too new on the scene.

113
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,820
They chose elizabeth instead.

114
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,470
Your bridesmaid? Give it time.

115
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,630
When it comes to these things,

116
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,860
It takes a while to start to matter.

117
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,880
Hey,if it makes you feel any better,

118
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,200
Maureen had to pick her bridesmaids
from a list provided by my grandfather.

119
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,990
Hey,i better go. The
rehearsal's starting.

120
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,060
Oh. Okay.

121
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,850
I'll just wait here... with
the rest of the commoners.

122
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,350
Hey. Hey,wes.

123
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,900
Is that the,uh, science fair project?

124
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,690
Yep. We're tracking air
quality on plant growth.

125
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,020
One of these was grown in our apartment,

126
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,810
And the other was grown
in wes' country house.

127
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,850
Apparently a tree does
not grow in brooklyn.

128
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,860
I better take off. Call you later?

129
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,560
Yeah.

130
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,460
Well,i hope for the sake of science that
that relationship is strictly professional.

131
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,230
Of course. But i'm working on it.

132
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,620
No,i get it. Rent trumps art.

133
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,720
Well,let me know if
you change your mind.

134
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,240
Nobody wants to buy art right now. Look,i'm
the one with the expensive yale tuition.

135
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,310
Please let me help. There's gotta be a job on
craigslist that doesn't involve dealing or nudity.

136
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,280
Dan,i have it under control.

137
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,880
Your priority is school.
I'm off to lily's.

138
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,900
She wants to go shopping
for a table,a lamp.

139
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,240
I'm not sure. Bye. (Jenny) bye.

140
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,180
Good luck.

141
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,160
I don't know he's being
so stubborn about this.

142
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,230
You know,wes' mom owns
a catering company.

143
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,690
Catering? That definitely
was not on the top of my list,

144
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,550
But,i mean,yeah,

145
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,420
If you--If you-- If
you don't mind asking...

146
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,500
Not at all,because then i
can ask him to come to dinner

147
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,760
With me as a thanks for
being so cool to my brother.

148
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,240
Hello,blair.

149
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,230
Good to see you.

150
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,630
You,too, mr. Van der bilt.

151
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,910
The wedding is going to be lovely.

152
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:49,760
Blair, it's reached my ears that
nate has been accepted to columbia.

153
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,420
Has he spoken to you of his intentions?

154
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,040
Not in so many words.

155
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,230
But i do know he's very proud
of having gotten in on his own.

156
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,570
As he should be.

157
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,930
My grandson values your opinion.

158
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:09,690
Perhaps you could show him that
yale is the appropriate choice.

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,860
I... think this is a decision
he needs to make himself.

160
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,850
Tell me,what are your
plans for next year?

161
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,100
I know you put off college.

162
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,850
Any word from the junior
committee for the whitney?

163
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,870
Actually... they didn't accept me.

164
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,870
Ah. I think that must
be some kind of mistake.

165
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,520
I'll call agnes chismer
immediately and clear that right up.

166
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:37,700
Really?

167
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,890
For a friend of my grandson,
there's nothing i wouldn't do.

168
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,730
Yale is an amazing school.

169
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,650
And... nate would look
dashing in bulldog blue.

170
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,110
And i want to be a bridesmaid.

171
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,420
I think,uh,she might
have room for one more.

172
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,200
Why did i give dorota the weekend off?

173
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,090
Ever since she and vanya fell in love,

174
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,870
All she thinks about is herself.

175
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,130
Hello?

176
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,630
Yes,this is cyrus rose.

177
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,940
This is serena van der woodsen.

178
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,330
??

179
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,680
How did antique shopping
turn into shoe shopping?

180
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,420
Well,my darling,

181
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,540
All shopping eventually
leads to shoe shopping.

182
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,680
If only people felt that way about art.
You're thinking about dan's tuition.

183
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,110
(Sighs) uh,mid-Range collectors
just aren't buying right now.

184
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,520
Well,you never know when
things will turn around. (Gasps)

185
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,290
Now who says that these are not art

186
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,350
Hey,mom. Nice shoes.

187
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,960
Could you give us a moment?

188
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,670
Welcome back. Thanks.

189
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,230
Mom,i know you're upset. No,i'm furious.

190
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,620
First you trash the apartment,
then you run away to spain.

191
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,520
I'm sorry.

192
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,990
I,um,i've just-- I've
been feeling really lost.

193
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,590
Oh,spare me,serena. The
only thing that is lost is

194
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,640
Your sense of responsibility
and consideration.

195
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,620
It seems to me like
the old serena is back,

196
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,850
And i'm not very happy to see her.

197
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,510
So you might want to take your coat off,

198
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,420
Because you're grounded.

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
S.! You're back from spain!

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,410
(Serena) yeah. I just landed.

201
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,330
Hey,uh,are you home? No.
More like avoiding it.

202
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,720
My mom and cyrus are hosting passover.

203
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,220
I thought firstborns were
supposed to be spared.

204
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,980
Oh,so--So you're not gonna be at the apartment
all day? I'm getting a dress fitted at reem acra,

205
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,600
And then nate and i are going
to his cousin's rehearsal dinner.

206
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,440
S., i'm one of the chosen ones.

207
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,210
I was wandering the bass-Ian desert

208
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,870
And now i've reached the
van der bilt promised land.

209
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,930
That's great. Um,listen,
i have to run some errands,

210
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,300
But let's talk later,okay?

211
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,110
I thought maureen was only
having five bridesmaids.

212
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,060
It was kind of last minute.

213
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,020
And i think a little higher on the hem.

214
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,740
(Grunts) so i'm gonna need a couple
minutes to practice my tray balancing.

215
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,130
I've never done this before.

216
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,110
Although i have a feeling i-I'll
be a tray-Balancing wunderkind.

217
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,620
Are you gonna do this nervous
talking thing all night?

218
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:46,140
It's cool. I just need to know. No,i'm
sorry. I-I didn't tell my dad i took this job,

219
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,910
And i-I feel so bad
keeping it from him,

220
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,280
But,you know, he gets so defensive.
I'll take that as a "yes."

221
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,930
Oh,no,no,no,no. Good. You're here.

222
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,460
I just ran out to buy some candles.

223
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,160
I don't understand why we
just can't light some votives.

224
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,690
You look familiar.

225
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,660
Have you worked for me before?

226
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,850
I did call them,and they
cannot send over a replacement.

227
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,410
They are absolutely overextended.

228
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,310
Mrs. Waldorf,i'm sure
that between corrine

229
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,820
And--And dorota... dorota
has the weekend off.

230
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,720
And i absolutely need two servers.

231
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,040
Cyrus' mother's coming,
and she hates me.

232
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,670
I have never thrown a seder before.

233
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:27,620
I don't even know how to say half the words in
this prayer book that's named for lieberman's wife.

234
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,250
She,uh,she's hadassah.

235
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,810
The--I think the prayer
book is called haggadah.

236
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,970
See? No,you cannot leave. With
all due respect, i-I don't--

237
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,390
I don't feel comfortable serving knishes
to blair. But blair won't be here.

238
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,820
And you don't serve knishes at passover.

239
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,320
I'll double your pay...

240
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,280
For both of you.

241
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,170
I could really use the money.

242
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,710
(Sighs) fine.

243
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,930
Great. Here are the linens.

244
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,480
Put one of these at every place.

245
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,470
Cyrus? Cyrus,i think
the brisket's burnin'.

246
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,070
Oh,no. Not at all, mrs. Chismer.

247
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,550
We all make mistakes.

248
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:10,940
Hi.

249
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,540
So i'll see you tuesday at the whitney?

250
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,670
So...

251
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,560
I've been thinking about
this whole college thing.

252
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,690
I'm going to columbia.

253
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,270
Okay.

254
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,030
Oh,maybe it's just my
old prejudice speaking,

255
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,270
Yale only accepted me
because of my grandfather.

256
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't want to owe him
or my family anything.

257
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,300
After tonight, we're done with them.

258
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,060
<i>Oh,b., too bad you weren't invited</i>

259
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,040
<i>To nate and tripp's lunch,
'cause whatever happened,</i>

260
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,730
<i>It looks like you're the one paying.</i>

261
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,190
Cyrus!

262
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,950
Your mother's here.

263
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,900
God,where is that man?

264
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,290
I can certainly look
into the legalities of it,

265
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,460
But... i think you
should tell your mother.

266
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,590
We're--We're not in a
good place right now.

267
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,800
I don't think i could
go up to her and say,

268
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,960
"Sorry,but i sort of
got married in spain.

269
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,750
"But don't worry.

270
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,930
Cyrus is helping me get
a quickie annulment."

271
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,250
She's your
mother. Sh--

272
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,970
??

273
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,170
??

274
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,740
Two days into the trip,

275
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,350
Poppy and gabriel get
in this huge fight,

276
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,010
And then she just leaves,
abandoning me and gabriel.

277
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,920
And so i-I stayed around to keep him
company. Well,you did a bang-Up job.

278
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,110
Dan,please. Gabriel and poppy were over,

279
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,890
And it's not like either
one of us planned this.

280
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,750
This--This thing
between us just happened,

281
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,600
And we couldn't stop it. This "thing"
was a marriage. What were you thinking?

282
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,640
I don't know. I-I wasn't. But i
don't even know if i am married.

283
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,530
That's what cyrus is trying to figure out.
How does one not know if one is married?

284
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,260
Well,there was a dinner,

285
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,750
And then we had a lot of rioja

286
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,910
And then dancing and then more rioja

287
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,400
And then we took off our clothes and went
swimming in the ocean. Okay,skip that part.

288
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,750
Yeah. Yeah,um, so--So
the next thing i know,

289
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,070
Gabriel is just screaming,
"i love you! I love you!"

290
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,530
And he's banging on this church door,

291
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,640
Trying to wake up a priest and-- O-Okay--Okay,so
there was a priest. Did you say "i do"?

292
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,930
<i>Well,i-I said "s?></i>

293
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,130
I don't know. It w-Was all in spanish.

294
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,580
It was--It
was crazy.

295
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,860
You're smiling. What?

296
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,460
You ran off to spain with
a guy you barely know.

297
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,930
You got married and you're-- A little bit--You're
smiling. No,i woke up the next morning,

298
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,750
And i thought,"what have
i done? This is crazy."

299
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,120
And i got on the next flight out
and here i am talking to cyrus.

300
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,610
You're a--You're
like-- You're a wife.

301
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:44,000
No,i'm not. Maybe i am. A-Are you jealous?
Serena,we were together for a year,

302
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,490
And we didn't make it to junior prom.

303
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,710
You're with this guy
for less than a month,

304
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,880
And you get married, so i mean,yeah,

305
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,080
It's a little bit insulting.

306
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,120
I-I have to-- I have
to get back to work.

307
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,750
Wait. Wait. Are you
serving eleanor's seder?

308
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,510
No.

309
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,480
Sort of. I mean,yes.

310
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,230
Yes...

311
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,860
You're the wife of the landed gentry,

312
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,250
And i'm a cater waiter at a seder.

313
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,310
Dan,wait.

314
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,220
<i>* i've got a man who's always late *</i>

315
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,030
<i>* any time we have a date</i>

316
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,540
<i>* but i love him</i>

317
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,530
Nate, tell me what's going on.

318
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,430
It's fine.

319
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,570
Listen,i'm just-- I'm
just glad you're here,okay?

320
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,650
You know, now might not be a good time

321
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,650
To say anything to your
grandfather about columbia.

322
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,080
Well,that should be easy,since
i'm not gonna speak to him.

323
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,680
<i>* and i'm gonna have him *</i>

324
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,570
Is there a problem,blair?

325
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:49,970
No. No problem. I just
need a few more minutes.

326
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,650
Oh,eleanor, thank you for doing this.

327
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,230
Please. I was very happy
that you invited yourself.

328
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,790
(Whispers) cyrus'
mother-- She hates me.

329
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,740
(Normal voice) another
friendly face is always welcome.

330
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,540
Hello,rufus. (Blows kiss) hey.

331
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,080
Oh,do you know that...

332
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,850
You'll find out.

333
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,010
That's allan levy, the art collector.

334
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,730
He's the guy who put a monet in his bathroom.
I--Oh,no. Well,he's an old friend of cyrus'.

335
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:33,740
You've been saying the mid-Range art market is dead,so i thought
it might be nice for you to meet a few high-End collectors.

336
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,990
Lil,i appreciate you trying to help,

337
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,770
But i am not fawning over an ass
like allan levy just to make a sale.

338
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:39,830
Oh,god.

339
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,300
Dan,what are you doing here? (Sighs)
um,i'm j-- I'm just here 'cause--

340
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,690
Because i invited him.

341
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,920
Oh. Lovely.

342
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,440
I'm sorry that i snuck
out,mom, but i had to see blair.

343
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,950
She invited me to
seder, so i invited dan.

344
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,050
Though blair is now strangely nowhere
to be seen. Well,lucky for you,

345
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,790
I don't want to cause
a scene at eleanor's.

346
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:02,240
We'll talk about this later. Dan,you're
dressed just like a cater waiter.

347
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,960
Yeah,well,y-You go for a
classic look with a black tie

348
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,350
And a white shirt, and that's what you
get. Serena, what are you doing here?

349
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,570
Blair invited her. Strange.

350
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:16,550
Blair made it absolutely clear that she
wasn't going to be here,but please stay.

351
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,560
Daniel,would you go downstairs
and get the kosher wine

352
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,080
And could you please make
yourself a little more presentable?

353
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,390
That was sorta rude.

354
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,760
Yeah,you know what? I'm just
gonna go with it. Attaboy.

355
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,550
Drinks? Yeah.

356
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,290
I would have invited you to the loft,

357
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,930
But the only chef we
have there is my dad,

358
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,580
And his specialties are
waffles and embarrassing me.

359
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,830
Do you want the top hat or the race car?

360
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,830
What,do you want the shoe?

361
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,380
This isn't the same girl i used to see
hanging out on the steps of the met.

362
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,680
Yeah,well,people change.

363
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,450
Great.

364
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,660
Good evening.

365
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,160
If you hear screams, don't
be alarmed. We're fine.

366
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,880
I think i'll be the thimble.

367
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,950
Rufus' gallery is in williamsburg.

368
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,820
You should move your
gallery to the city.

369
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,480
Williamsburg is already over.

370
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,300
I didn't realize a whole
neighborhood could be over.

371
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,530
My friends,it's time
for the seder to begin.

372
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,500
Dan,uh,i need you to know
that i'm really sorry.

373
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,060
Dan,we need matzo!

374
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,530
Serena,being eleanor's bitch boy is about
all i can take right now,so i... (chuckles)

375
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,750
I really don't need your pity.

376
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,360
Okay,but just please
understand that what happened

377
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,390
Between me and gabriel
has nothing to do with you.

378
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,400
Uh,yeah,sure.

379
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,410
But a person doesn't just go
off and suddenly get married.

380
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,810
You're clearly reacting to
something. (Eleanor) dan!

381
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,870
I gotta get matzo.

382
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,710
* whatever lola wants

383
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,280
Tripp. Blair.

384
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,450
Did you say something to nate?

385
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,850
He feels lucky,you know, that
you two are back together.

386
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:03,470
He told me how much you've
both changed. Is that true?

387
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,210
Yes.

388
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,490
Of course.

389
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,410
We've changed a lot.

390
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,950
Well,be good to him,okay?

391
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,280
What did you tell him?

392
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,890
Well,good evening.

393
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,280
Oh,no. Most of you know me.

394
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,900
I'm nate archibald, tripp's cousin.

395
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,120
When tripp asked me to be
the best man in his wedding,

396
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,080
I was a little bit
surprised, to say the least.

397
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,610
But i guess grandfather
told him to choose me

398
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,810
And that was that,so... (laughter)

399
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,850
But we all know how important
family is to william van der bilt.

400
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:44,740
But what we don't know are the many
secret ways he helps us all out.

401
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,080
For instance, today i discovered

402
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,180
He was the one who had my father
investigated by the authorities.

403
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,380
(Scoffs) and if he cares
so much about family,

404
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,420
Then why did he destroy mine?

405
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,190
So i guess the lesson here...

406
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,030
Tripp,old buddy...

407
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,820
Is watch your back.

408
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,170
To family.

409
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,430
<i>Uh-Oh,b.</i>

410
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,640
<i>Looks like you hitched your
wagon to a falling star.</i>

411
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,500
Can i help you? Yes,i'm
gabriel. I'm looking for serena.

412
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,550
<i>Baruch atah ay dios mio.</i>

413
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:37,620
??

414
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:44,340
The jewish people's flight
from slavery to freedom.

415
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,790
(Whispering) you need
to come to the foyer.

416
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,170
Dan,i know you're upset,

417
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,520
But now is not a good time. Cyrus is
about to pray. ...we light the candles.

418
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,540
You really need to come
out there,like,right now.

419
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,670
Normally we do this before sunset,

420
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,170
But i won't tell if you don't.

421
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,200
Excuse me.

422
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,290
What is so important?

423
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,890
Oh,no. Exactly.

424
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,210
Gabriel,wh-What-- What
are you doing here?

425
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,200
How can you ask me that? I
woke up and you were gone.

426
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,250
Not even a note. But
how did you even find me?

427
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,030
I called your apartment.

428
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,920
The guy who answered said
you'd probably be here.

429
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,480
He also asked me if i had any hash.

430
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,250
This is obviously between the two of you,so...
no,you're not leaving. Please. I can call you,

431
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,310
But you have to go now.
No,i'm not going anywhere.

432
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:40,340
We have to talk. You
owe me at least that.

433
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,000
Please,gabriel,don't.

434
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,860
Why won't you even talk to me?

435
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,290
I mean,after everything that we've-- Because
dan is my boyfriend. We got in a fight

436
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:52,080
Before i left for spain,
and once i got there,

437
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,060
I got a little carried away,

438
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,180
But no matter what,
i-I had to come back.

439
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:59,570
Dan was my first love, and
nothing can change that.

440
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,950
Yeah,it,uh,it's true. It's true.

441
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,030
I love serena.

442
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,170
No matter what crazy thing she does,

443
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,740
Uh,i-I will always love her.

444
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,280
I'm sorry,but,serena,

445
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,480
You've--You've never
mentioned him before.

446
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,090
Well,i'm sure i had to
come up at least once.

447
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,780
At any point?

448
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:22,180
Gabriel,i will call you,
but y-You do have to leave.

449
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,420
This is a family dinner.

450
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:27,370
Dan,cyrus says that we
are missing a lamb bone.

451
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,580
Oh,hello.

452
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,990
<i>Is this another one of your friends?</i>

453
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,890
Yeah,um,sort of, but he's leaving.

454
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,350
I apologize. I didn't mean
to interrupt your evening.

455
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,520
Oh,not at all,not at all.
Would you like to join us?

456
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,990
We're having a seder.
No,no,i'm sure he can't.

457
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,880
No,no. I'd love to meet
the people in serena's life.

458
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,350
Perhaps it'll help me better understand
her. Wonderful. There's even an empty seat.

459
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,340
It's for elijah, but you can take it.

460
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,460
You are in serious
danger of losing your tip.

461
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,320
(Flo rida and kesha) * when
you go down,when you go down *

462
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,490
<i>(Flo rida) * hey,walk out
my house with my swagger *</i>

463
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,550
Did you know about this?

464
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,190
What? No,of course not.

465
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,770
You have five minutes to fix it.

466
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,670
Did you really turn in the captain?
Before you take a stand on principle,

467
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,120
Remember what you have at stake.

468
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,650
Or do you plan to spend next year
sewing buttons at your mother's atelier?

469
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:16,590
Now go.

470
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:21,330
<i>* then pop in the next
and this mix will be ours *</i>

471
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,440
<i>Then we eat the afikomen,</i>

472
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,490
Say the blessing after the meal,

473
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,550
Sing a few songs, and then we're done.

474
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:31,480
So as soon as everyone
has some wine,we'll begin.

475
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,490
Wait. We haven't started.

476
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:40,760
Uh,i'm sorry. Are you the gabriel as in the gabriel
that was in spain with poppy and my daughter?

477
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:41,740
Yes. In
fact--

478
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,310
Cyrus,this wine is delicious.
Oh,well,thank you,dear.

479
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,630
We're not supposed to
drink it until the blessing,

480
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,390
But,uh,we'll make an
exception this time.

481
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,640
Rufus,do you represent any
artists worth my attention?

482
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,980
All of my artists are worth attention.

483
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,610
Otherwise i wouldn't represent them.

484
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,680
* hey,shawty must know i'm the man *

485
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,040
* my money love her

486
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,940
Why is he serving the wine?
Isn't he supposed to be...

487
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,990
He is just helpful. That's all.

488
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,610
Dan,baby,um,come sit down
right here next to me,please.

489
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,880
Oh,well,that's where
we just moved elijah.

490
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,060
But never mind.

491
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,540
Eleanor,you don't mind
if he joins us,do you?

492
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,810
At this point,why not? We're
not eating any time soon.

493
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:25,600
* "damn it,i know you,"
you wanna shoot... *

494
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,940
Oh,no. You
two haven't--

495
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,810
Now we will say the kiddush,
or prayer for the first cup.

496
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:35,370
I'll say this in english because
as i look around this table,

497
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,560
I see that most of our guests
are not speakers of hebrew.

498
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,660
You've got to be kidding me. (Cyrus)
we praise you, adonai,our god,

499
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,820
Ruler of the universe,who
creates the fruit of the vine...

500
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,020
* ain't nothin' more
beautiful to be found *

501
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,700
* it's goin' down,down *

502
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,650
* from the top of the
pole, i watch her go down *

503
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,580
* she got me throwin' my money around *

504
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,960
What? Do you not like?

505
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,540
Have we done this before?

506
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,710
I thought you'd remember.

507
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,040
Last year, after sleeping beauty...

508
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,930
I need to get a drink.

509
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,010
No! Ugh.

510
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,620
Yes! Not again.

511
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,030
That takes you right to my
property--Marvin gardens.

512
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,700
Pay up. What a shock. The
girl from brooklyn's a renter.

513
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,710
Don't you have a guest to attend to?
It appears i already did, a year ago.

514
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,450
I probably should have
noticed in the elevator.

515
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:34,110
How many women can put their legs behind
their... hey,um,do you wanna go for a walk?

516
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,560
Okay. Sure.

517
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,220
I'll just meet you at the elevator.

518
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,060
Okay.

519
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,040
You know,just 'cause you're
bored with your own life

520
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:46,230
Doesn't mean you have to make
everyone around you miserable.

521
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:50,210
For your information, you don't
live here yet. (Scoffs) please.

522
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,430
After what you did at the kiss
on the lips party last year,

523
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,720
<i>Like i would ever live
in the same house as you.</i>

524
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,640
You know,you're lucky
i didn't tell my dad,

525
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,680
Because if i did,he'd make
lily choose--Us or you--

526
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,650
And i wonder who she'd pick. Do you
really think i care if lily kicks me out?

527
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,590
Yeah,i do, because you lost blair,

528
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,130
And now she's dating your best friend.

529
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:16,660
So therefore the only human contact that you have
that you don't pay for is the people in this house.

530
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,460
Knowing you, you'll screw that up,too.

531
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,450
Are you coming back?

532
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,150
You can let yourself out.

533
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,280
Nate.

534
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,420
Blair,i'm... i'm so sorry.

535
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,270
I should have told you.

536
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,210
It's fine. Are you okay?

537
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:40,840
Yeah.

538
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,270
I mean,no,i'm not.

539
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,860
You know,i trusted him.

540
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,200
I mean,was i wrong?

541
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,120
No.

542
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,350
You're wonderful.

543
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:04,440
I'm gonna go get my
coat. Then we can go.

544
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,260
Okay.

545
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,430
Nathaniel.

546
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,360
I did turn your father in,

547
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,560
But only after i confronted
him and begged him to stop.

548
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,550
When he denied it to my face,

549
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,730
I warned him that i would take action.

550
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,890
Finally...

551
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,840
To prevent further damage
to you and your mother,

552
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,920
I called the s.E.C.

553
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,750
And i'd do it again.

554
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,650
Why couldn't you have just told me this?

555
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,070
Is that what you want,
nathaniel--The truth?

556
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:46,300
Yes. I'm just so tired of people
lying to me and going behind my back.

557
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:47,610
Okay.

558
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,830
Let's start again.
Nothing but the truth.

559
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,740
But in that case,

560
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,310
There's something you should know.

561
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,360
<i>Watch out,b.</i>

562
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,940
<i>It seems like just
when you got it right,</i>

563
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,060
??

564
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,590
That was the washing of the hands,

565
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:16,130
Also called the title 88 of
the new york city health code.

566
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:21,000
Next we have the
dipping of the vegetable.

567
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,610
You mean we're finally going to get
to eat something? Oh,yes,parsley.

568
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,990
So are you two really together again?

569
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,590
(Cyrus) so if,uh,corrine
would get everyone

570
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,920
The salt water for dipping-- Wait.
I'm sorry. Why doesn't everybody

571
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,560
Seem to know the two of
you are back together?

572
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,090
And what kind of daughter doesn't--
Shh. There's praying about to happen.

573
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,900
But--I'm so sorry,cyrus--
When did... that's fine.

574
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,700
When did this happen? You
just broke up two months ago.

575
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,550
I thought you said you broke up right
before spain. Mm. It's complicated.

576
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:52,160
Eleanor's friends are
talking during the seder.

577
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,880
They're both of our
friends, mother. Thank you.

578
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,490
I'm sorry. I-I just don't
believe he's your boyfriend.

579
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:03,030
First of all, he's dressed like a waiter.
I think it's kind of a classic look.

580
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,550
Well,he is my boyfriend,

581
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,420
And we are very happy together.

582
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,970
Serena-- I am
so sorry,cyrus.

583
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,260
No. No. Go right
ahead. What is going on?

584
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,250
I-I'm a cater waiter.

585
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,810
And not a very good one.

586
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,530
Wait. What? I didn't want you to know,

587
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,640
So--So we were pretending
that we're back together.

588
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,130
She's just trying to
be a good friend,really.

589
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,820
I'm  mrry.

590
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,530
Apology accepted. Now
take your parsley...

591
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,400
Where's corrine with the salt
water? Hold on. I'm--I'm sorry.

592
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,200
Is this you trying to help with college?

593
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,280
I know you didn't want me to,dad,

594
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,630
But i-I couldn't do nothing.

595
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,530
By the way,serena and
i may not be together,

596
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,460
But i do care about her very much.

597
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,700
Now who needs more wine?

598
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,630
Serena,a word?

599
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,940
(Cyrus) all right, we'll
skip the bitter herbs.

600
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,540
Uh,moving on to the matzo.

601
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,780
Hey,you know what?

602
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,530
I'm,uh,i need some air.

603
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:15,870
I'm gonna walk home,so you
just--Just go ahead,okay?

604
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,280
Nate,what's wrong?

605
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,890
I'm proud of what you did back there.

606
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:20,990
I thought you were,too.

607
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,480
Did you tell my grandfather

608
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,690
You would convince me to go to yale

609
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,780
In exchange for him
making you a bridesmaid?

610
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,880
I can explain.

611
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,030
That's great,you know?

612
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,330
First my grandfather
sells my father out,

613
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,020
<i>And then you sell me out for
a picture in the style section.</i>

614
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,720
No. But i didn't!

615
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,790
I mean,god,i did,

616
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,600
But then i realized when he
asked me again-- No,you know what?

617
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,560
I actually thought this
time would be different.

618
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,790
But you're just--You're just
the same girl you always were.

619
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,000
No,i'm not! I...

620
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,940
I was just scared
about next year and us.

621
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,700
Nate,please give me another chance.

622
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,990
I want to trust you.

623
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:08,970
Okay? But...

624
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,640
I can't think of a single
reason why i should.

625
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,580
The car will take you home.

626
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,340
So this is how it's going to be?

627
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,510
The day is not even over, and you've
already defied me about your grounding,

628
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,110
Caused a scene at eleanor's
seder-- It wasn't a scene.

629
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,600
Yes,it was,right out of
the old serena playbook.

630
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,040
You could have thrown in a few
boys from the lacrosse team,

631
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,320
And it would have been the constance
mother-Daughter luncheon all over again.

632
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:40,100
(Sighs) you have been so good the last two
years. Well,i can't live like that anymore.

633
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,760
Why not? Mom,i know that i have
hurt you and eric and blair.

634
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,820
I've done a lot of things
that i'm not proud of,

635
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:49,640
And i don't wanna go back to
that,but it wasn't all bad.

636
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,940
I miss the good parts.
I miss feeling free,

637
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,550
Feeling like i can do something
just because i want to,

638
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,530
And there has to be a balance.
Well,of course there does.

639
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,020
But if every time i make a mistake,

640
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,540
You look at me like i'm a bad person,

641
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:05,390
Then how am i supposed to find that? Oh,sweetheart,i
could never think of you as a bad person.

642
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,100
You got into brown.

643
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,230
The letter came while you were away.

644
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,670
I got into brown?

645
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,040
Yeah.

646
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,110
Congratulations.

647
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,300
And i do trust you.

648
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,380
I got into brown.

649
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:24,820
Yes.

650
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,400
Now what are you gonna do about gabriel?

651
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:30,860
What do you mean?

652
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:35,350
Oh,please. He was a little too upset
about dan to,um,be just a friend.

653
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,380
I don't know. I,um,i like him,

654
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,310
But it's kind of a mess.

655
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,680
Sometimes those messes can be fun.

656
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:47,570
I'm sorry. If you're talking
about that hot guy from dinner,

657
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,070
He just left.

658
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,340
Gabriel.

659
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:56,940
Gabriel.

660
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,120
You wanted me to leave. I left.

661
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,160
I'm sorry that i lied,
but you scared me,

662
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,880
Showing up here like that.

663
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,750
I am just not ready to be married.

664
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,300
Is that what you think is going on?

665
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,250
Well,yeah,

666
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,820
We were in a church,
and there was a priest.

667
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,080
At least i think he was a priest.

668
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,530
I don't know. I drank a lot of
rioja,but... of course we're not married.

669
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,350
I don't even know if that
was the priest i woke up.

670
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:26,780
It could have been the
gardener. R... really?

671
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,790
Really. We were just having
fun, doing something crazy.

672
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,820
Oh,i,um...

673
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,340
Wow. Well,that's a relief.

674
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,160
So that waiter's not your boyfriend?

675
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,320
No.

676
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,420
What about me?

677
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,100
Serena.

678
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,670
<i>Ah,cruel fate.</i>

679
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,250
<i>Just as serena van der
woodsen is falling in love,</i>

680
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,670
<i>Blair waldorf is falling apart.</i>

681
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,560
(Sighs) look,i told you,

682
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,950
I'm not in the mood.

683
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,210
Good. Neither am i.

684
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,720
Was it stupid of me
to think blair changed?

685
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:35,900
Yes.

686
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,720
So she's just...

687
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,660
The way she is.

688
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:51,460
<i>I mean,it's stupid for you to want
her to be anything other than she is.</i>

689
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,250
Anyway,blair is changing.

690
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,430
How do you know?

691
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,760
Because she could have had me.

692
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:05,740
She chose you.

693
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,180
Now she just needs
someone to believe in her.

694
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,240
Time for a refill.

695
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,000
Hey. I'll get it.

696
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,760
Thanks.

697
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,200
Your father and i are heading out,

698
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,230
And i know what you were
trying to do for serena.

699
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,650
You're a good friend.

700
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,680
I'm not a very good cater waiter.

701
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,240
But i'm a good salesman.

702
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,050
You sold allan levy a painting.

703
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,640
It also gave me an idea of
something else i should sell--

704
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,280
The gallery.

705
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,110
Oh,rufus. Dad,come on.

706
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,720
When i started out, i was
selling to young couples,

707
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,810
Kids who had no money but loved art,

708
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,990
And somehow, over time,that changed.

709
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:07,090
And tonight i realized i just
don't love doing this anymore.

710
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,730
And if i'm really honest,

711
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,220
I haven't for some time.

712
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,390
Oh,well,okay. What are you gonna do?

713
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,790
I'm not sure.

714
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,000
But i'm excited to find out.

715
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,250
(Laughs) see you at home.

716
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:30,670
I can't believe i sold out
nate to be the next jackie o.

717
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,510
Yeah,i always pictured
you as the next hillary.

718
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,100
<i>Except i'd win.</i>

719
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,220
What am i gonna do?

720
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,790
I don't know.

721
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,400
You'll figure something out.

722
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,570
Besides,who wants to be on the junior
committee for the whitney anyway?

723
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,430
Do you think i care about that?

724
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,830
I lost nate. I deserve to be alone.

725
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:59,260
And who was that tall snack
you were devouring outside?

726
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,690
Oh,uh,that is...

727
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:05,910
A long story.

728
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,150
Blair?

729
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,480
There is someone downstairs
who wants to speak with you.

730
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,450
I was pretty awful
to cyrus this morning.

731
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,720
I should go apologize.

732
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,580
B.,i'm really happy to be home.

733
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:27,870
Archibald.

734
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,710
* i was feeling sad

735
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,990
* can't help looking back *

736
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:39,160
* highways flew by

737
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,330
* run,run away

738
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,750
* no sense of time

739
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,760
* like you to stay

740
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,600
* want to keep you inside

741
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,310
Hey.

742
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,890
I thought my dad would be here,

743
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,220
We're supposed to meet up to go home.

744
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,050
How was your date?

745
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:58,870
Good.

746
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,000
Great,actually.

747
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:09,680
I never apologized for
what happened last year.

748
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,060
I deeply regret my
actions of that night.

749
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,570
If you ever do move in here...

750
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,520
I'll make sure i'm not around.

751
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,620
* run,run away

752
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,670
* no sense of time

753
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,970
* like you to stay

754
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:45,110
* want to keep you inside

755
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,260
Cyrus.

756
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,410
I apologize about missing the seder

757
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,930
And being so snotty about n.Y.U.

758
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:01,540
Can you forgive me?

759
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,010
Well,that's why god invented yom kippur.

760
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,330
And when you said you could
call in a favor at n.Y.U...

761
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,580
Did you mean it?

762
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:14,670
Well,i carried j.R. On my back
for five hours through the jungle.

763
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,150
But i can only get you an interview.

764
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,020
It's gonna be up to you to wow him.

765
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,440
Thank you.

766
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,820
Sounds like we'll both be in the city.

767
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:28,440
Nate?

768
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:29,880
Yes.

769
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,100
Well,who did you think
i was talking about?

770
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,700
Blair,i,uh... i'm so sorry.

771
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:45,560
* not so strong without
these open arms *

772
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,330
* hold on tight

773
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,780
* i'm *

774
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:57,380
* not that strong
without these open arms *

775
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,260
<i>(Gabriel) this is gabriel.
Leave a message. (Beep)</i>

776
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,130
Hey,gabriel. It's me.

777
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,870
Uh,i-I just wanted to say

778
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:14,340
That i don't know what's
gonna happen with us,but,um...

779
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,560
I'm really glad you came back for me.

780
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,320
Okay. Um,that's it.

781
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,100
I-I will talk to you tomorrow.

782
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,530
<i>On passover,we ask, why
is it that this night</i>

783
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,430
<i>Is different from any
other night? (Vibrating)</i>

784
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,680
<i>But who are we kidding?</i>

785
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:37,170
So...

786
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:39,960
Tell me everything.

787
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:45,160
<i>Tonight's no different from the rest.</i>

788
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,570
<i>These things always happen around here.</i>
