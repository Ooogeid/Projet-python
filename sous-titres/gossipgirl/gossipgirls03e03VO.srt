3
00:00:05,883 --> 00:00:08,150
You will find your place.
Just give it time.

4
00:00:08,422 --> 00:00:10,339
No,i found my place,
and it's at the bottom.

5
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:13,320
Scott,I cannot believe you told
vanessa to take professor Rifkin.

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,760
I-i'm at a party.I really don't feel
like taking a test right now.

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,565
If your family can accept us together,

8
00:00:17,615 --> 00:00:19,120
Maybe one day mine will,too.

9
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:22,815
- I'm opening a restaurant.
- Downstairs he's creating a club.

10
00:00:22,865 --> 00:00:24,030
You wanted to ruin my deal,

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,280
So you came here and brought
carter baizen as your wingman.

12
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,030
I don't want anyone else. I want you.

13
00:00:29,347 --> 00:00:30,850
You know what ?
I'm still a little wrecked,

14
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,450
- So,uh,i'll call you later.
- Okay.

Bon épisode à tous ! ! !

21
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:52,620
Morning in new york--
time to wake up from bad dreams,

22
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,300
roll out of the beds we've made

23
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,960
and start making plans
for a brighter future.

24
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,880
Chuck,it's me.
I know this sounds weird schedule

25
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,110
But with you focused on making
your mark in the business world

26
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,540
And me focused on...

27
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:08,132
Point being,
I just got t of my first class,

28
00:01:08,182 --> 00:01:10,516
And I was thinking
if I skipped french history,

29
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:14,485
We might have enough time to squeeze in
a mid-morning renaissance before lunch.

30
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:25,021
Ew ! God, no ! Ugh !

31
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:27,740
I'm wearing a glove,
and i still want to wash my hands!

32
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:30,241
Hey, roomie. Dan was just--

33
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:33,258
I was--i was just--i was getting a book
that i needed. It's,um,

34
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:36,690
"our bodies, ourselves: a new edition
for a new era. "That's excellent.

35
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,462
No, i know what this is, and don't
think that you can run me out

36
00:01:39,512 --> 00:01:41,480
of my own room with a half-naked
dan humphrey.

37
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,190
Fine. Stay.
Maybe you'll learn something.

38
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,330
No, that's okay.

39
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,480
I was just about to hit the trail,
you know?

40
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,073
It just so happens i'm on my way
to a very important breakfast.

41
00:01:50,123 --> 00:01:53,470
I just stopped by to drop off my books
and pick up my mail.

42
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,820
So feel free to hit the trail all you want.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,920
From serena to georgina ?

44
00:01:58,306 --> 00:02:00,320
Quite a fall,even for you.

45
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:02,289
Don't worry about blair.

46
00:02:03,195 --> 00:02:05,040
I knew she'd have a problem with us.

47
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:08,019
But i think vanessa's
gonna be supportive,

48
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:11,319
and Serena and Jenny, Your dad.

49
00:02:12,903 --> 00:02:13,790
Hey.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,310
I'm starved.
Want to grab breakfast ?

51
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,690
Um,you know what ? I-I gotta be
somewhere, but, uh, rain check ?

52
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,405
Sure. No biggie.

53
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:26,538
Thanks.

54
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:34,880
Dan ?

55
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,371
What ? Oh, of course.

56
00:02:37,568 --> 00:02:39,510
Did I just catch you on a walk of shame ?

57
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,790
No. No. No, don't be silly.
I was visiting, uh, uh, vanessa.

58
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,760
She's on this new
Chinese Feng Shui kick,

59
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,990
And she makes you take
your shoes off when you...

60
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,200
And your shirt ?

61
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,528
Yeah,it's weird.

62
00:02:51,406 --> 00:02:53,270
I thought I heard your voices.

63
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:55,311
What's going on ?

64
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:58,830
I was looking for blair's room,
And dan here claims he was visiting you.

65
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,716
But if that's vanessa's room,
then where...

66
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,905
- Please tell me it was blair and not georgina.
- Please tell me it was georgina and not blair.

67
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:09,960
I don't want to talk about this right now,in the hallway...Or ever.

68
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,100
Never would also be good. I would like that.

69
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,500
I-i just mean that when you
do something no one knows about,

70
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,010
It's kind of like you're
not really doing it.

71
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,460
But when someone finds out about it...
- It becomes real.

72
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,150
Yeah.

73
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,080
college is time for experimentation,
Psychedelic drugs, ethnic food...

74
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,019
Girls who once pretended to
be "sarah" from portland.

75
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:29,880
Okay, so--so, uh, you guys are what ?

76
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,150
We're just going to tease you mercilessly.

77
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,534
But without judgment, 'cause who doesn't
have a Georgina in their closet, right?

78
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:37,270
Right.

79
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,295
Right.

80
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,780
Okay. I was coming to see blair,
But now that she's not here,uh,

81
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,410
You want to button up
and come with me, tiger ?

82
00:03:45,873 --> 00:03:47,209
I'll come with you.

83
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:49,683
Scott has his comp theory seminar
in the mornings,

84
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:51,820
And,um,i'm gonna try to catch him for coffee.

85
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,150
Oh, i thought the, uh, comp
theory seminar was in the afternoon.

86
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,626
Georgina's friend just kept talking
about how hard it was to get in.

87
00:03:58,575 --> 00:04:00,885
I completely forgot how much reading
i have to do before class,

88
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:03,180
So i'm--i'm just gonna catch
up with you guys later.

89
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:04,222
Okay.

90
00:04:12,642 --> 00:04:13,690
Vanessa, hey.

91
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,142
Hey. How was, um, comp theory ?

92
00:04:17,034 --> 00:04:19,020
Non stop excitement. Lots of theories.

93
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,099
Yeah,i just ran into dan,

94
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:22,940
 and he thought the seminars
were in the afternoons or something.

95
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,880
Yeah,the seminars are, but the
study groups are in the mornings.

96
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,200
Then why don't i swing by your study group,and we can grab coffee?

97
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,590
I'd love to. It's just, um, I can't.
I'm sorry. I have to go.

98
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,870
- I'll call you later.
- Yeah. Bye.

99
00:04:41,257 --> 00:04:42,630
Vanessa says hi.

100
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:44,790
Did you tell her you were a natural?

101
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,160
One week of guitar lessons,
you got all the major chords.

102
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,160
Thanks again.
And i've always wanted to learn.

103
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,190
I just figured i'd take a shotat getting
a few*from one of the greats.

104
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,370
Well,i don't know about one
of the "greats."

105
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,210
Maybe one of the "pretty goods."

106
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,743
All right. Here we go.

107
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:07,520
Actually been meaning to
talk to you about something.

108
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:08,867
Me, too.

109
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:11,947
You know,vanessa's
like a daughter to me, and...

110
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:15,260
Not to slip into after-school
special territory,

111
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,350
But i just wanted to, uh, make sure--

112
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,330
Don't worry.
Vanessa-- i like her a lot. I do.

113
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,266
It's just,um,
i hope everything works out.

114
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,700
Why wouldn't it?

115
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:28,340
Hey, scott. Dad, uh,
you excited about the auction tonight ?

116
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,710
Uh, lily has a photo for sale at
the charity auction at sotheby's.

117
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,280
I'm gonna go and check out the c****

118
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,010
oh, wow. '72 bowie is a
dead ringer for shakira.

119
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,416
You know, i-i should,
 um I should probably take off.

120
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:40,635
But i thought you wanted to talk.

121
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,510
Oh, it can wait.

122
00:05:42,814 --> 00:05:45,020
Maybe next time we jam.
Is wednesday still good ?

123
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,019
See you then.

124
00:05:46,172 --> 00:05:47,017
All right.

125
00:05:51,082 --> 00:05:53,460
Dad, scott's been spending
a lot of time here lately.

126
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:56,807
Yeah,he's a good kid.
Good guitar player,too.

127
00:05:57,194 --> 00:05:59,850
So you're being pretty open-minded
about this georgina thing.

128
00:06:00,188 --> 00:06:02,510
Well,maybe it's because
since i started dating carter,

129
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,152
I have never been more
pleasantly surprised.

130
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:07,800
Oh, so you're-- you're now dating
carter baizen ?

131
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,090
Is it because chuck
isn't currently available?

132
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,100
He's not like chuck anymore,

133
00:06:12,401 --> 00:06:13,990
Which is why i'm saying,

134
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,630
If you want to date georgina,
then more power to you.

135
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,470
I would just check to make sure
there's not an ice pick under the bed.

136
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,630
We're not dating. We are, uh,

137
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,050
we're just--we're hanging out.
- Then piece of advice?

138
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,910
You should make sure she knows that.
'Cause if georgina likes somebody,

139
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,560
she will go from zero to crazy
before you know it.

140
00:06:30,011 --> 00:06:32,025
- Good luck.
- Thanks. You, too.

141
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:34,893
Hey.

142
00:06:35,609 --> 00:06:37,793
why are we meeting downtown ?
What's the big surprise ?

143
00:06:37,843 --> 00:06:39,390
I've been staying at the downing.

144
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,830
What do yosay to a weekend of
room service and white fluffy robes?

145
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,470
Can you afford a hotel ?
I thought your parents cut you off.

146
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,858
When there's a white fluffy robe,
there's a way.

147
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,640
- Unless you have plans tonight.
- Well, not me, but maybe we ?

148
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,947
There's this family thing tonight.
It's an auction, but i thought may--

149
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:55,989
Carter ?

150
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,243
Aubrey.

151
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:01,360
We met at brandy library last month.

152
00:07:01,603 --> 00:07:03,810
You have no idea who i am, do you ?

153
00:07:04,164 --> 00:07:08,051
No, but probably because I wasn't
at the brandy library last month.

154
00:07:08,497 --> 00:07:11,392
Oh, okay. So i guess i had
sex with another carter baizen

155
00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:13,910
Who drinksis single malt
with one ice cube

156
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,650
And claimed to be leaving with the peace corps the next day.

157
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,850
Sounds like a charming fellow.

158
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,490
Mistaken identity?

159
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,075
Obviously.
You know i take my scotch neat.

160
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:28,090
I have no idea who that woman is,
serena.

161
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,130
That's--hey, that--that's
not me anymore.

162
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,010
Okay.

163
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,390
What about tonight ?
You were gonna ask me something ?

164
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,973
Uh, you know what ?
It was... It was nothing. I...

165
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,440
I'll-i'll call you later.

166
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,120
Scott adler--i just need to
know if he's in comp theory.

167
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:50,690
I'm sorry,but we're not allowed
to give out students' class schedules.

168
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,326
when faced with an uncertain future,

169
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:55,320
the questions we truly hate to ask

170
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,575
are the ones we fear we already
know the answer to.

171
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,550
What if he's not a student ?
I don't need his schedule.

172
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,503
I just need to know that he
actually goes here. Please.

173
00:08:05,927 --> 00:08:09,320
My last boyfriend told me his
dad invented the battery.

174
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:16,359
I'm sorry. There's no record
of a scott adler in our system

175
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:33,530
I recommend e hot apple cider caramel.

176
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:34,720
On what ?

177
00:08:36,318 --> 00:08:37,668
Surprise me.

178
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:44,897
You are amazing.

179
00:08:47,998 --> 00:08:48,879
But look,

180
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:50,065
I, uh,

181
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:54,353
I have a really big meeting
in a few hours.

182
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,098
A few hours is hours from now.

183
00:08:59,427 --> 00:09:00,672
Seriously.

184
00:09:01,694 --> 00:09:05,369
It's important.
I have to keep my... Focus.

185
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:10,593
It with sean macpherson.
I'm only gonna get one shot with him.

186
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,050
As opposed to me,
who's just some endless font of do-over

187
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,812
Look, i'll make it up to you.

188
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:18,260
Where are you going ?

189
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:21,460
No idea. I officially have nowhere left to go.

190
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,235
My roommate is a nympho with a socfetish,
I have no friends at school,

191
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:26,840
and now my boyfriend would rather
obsess about a restaurateur

192
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,680
Than spend quality time with me--

193
00:09:30,013 --> 00:09:32,103
And hasn't, by the way, in five days.

194
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,882
<i>in biblical times,</i>

195
00:09:43,932 --> 00:09:48,320
<i>destiny was delivered  in the form
of stone tablets or a burning bush.</i>

196
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,640
<i>but today,
true destiny is often engraved</i>

197
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,666
and carries an embossed seal.

198
00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:57,336
<i>You've been invited to
 La Table Elitaire Good Luck</i>

199
00:09:57,524 --> 00:10:00,498
Oh... My... God.

200
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:06,670
Serena ?
You won't believe what I just got.

201
00:10:10,163 --> 00:10:12,253
I got that. Hi. Hey. How's it going ?

202
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:20,220
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

203
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,410
What are you doing here ?

204
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:26,700
I was just, uh, i-i-i wanted
to talk to you about us.

205
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,770
No-not us  us.

206
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:32,350
It's, uh, look, here's the thing.
I would like to hang out with you.

207
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,324
But i just want to make sure that
there's no misunderstanding.

208
00:10:34,374 --> 00:10:38,443
We're on the same page
about us, uh,hanging out like we do.

209
00:10:38,703 --> 00:10:40,620
If you want me to leave, i can understand. Uh...

210
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,230
That was your first of those talks, huh ?

211
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,191
Yeah. How was i ?

212
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:48,698
You're adorable.

213
00:10:52,574 --> 00:10:54,675
Come on. I was heading out for pizza.

214
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,300
Don't worry. No strings.

215
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,085
Yeah, ay. Yeah, yeah.
I like--i like pizza.

216
00:11:02,623 --> 00:11:03,985
That was easy.

217
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:06,620
le table Elitaire ?

218
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,050
The elite table.
How have you not heard of them ?

219
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,660
It's a secret society.

220
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,760
If i had heard of it,
it wouldn't be a secret.

221
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,430
They're modeled after
the grandes moles in france.

222
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,710
Secret salons for the elit
of academic institutions.

223
00:11:18,856 --> 00:11:22,010
Finally something exclusive
to strive for,

224
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,170
Something worthy on all my pent-up
energy and attention.

225
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,050
So i take it you and chuck still havet--

226
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,188
No, and if he wants to focus
on something other than us, So can i.

227
00:11:31,562 --> 00:11:34,016
You know, in a way, i blame all this on you.

228
00:11:34,168 --> 00:11:34,978
Me ?

229
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:38,920
Yes. Well,he told me about how you
killed his speakeasy plan last week,

230
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,114
and hanging out with carter baizen...
l-listen to me. S.

231
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:44,910
Listen very carefully.

232
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,030
You're not going to brown.
You're scared to tell your mom.

233
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,400
You're in free fall.
Enter carter baizen.

234
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,670
I get it. Believe me.

235
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,638
But you need to
pull this chute before splat!

236
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,610
No, it's--it's not like that.
He's different with me.

237
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,290
He actually knows me.

238
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,730
And who are you trying to convince--
me or you?

239
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:11,860
Carter, I wanted to invite you to
the sotheby's auction with me tonight.

240
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,284
Call me back and let me
know that you can come.

241
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,250
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

242
00:12:17,565 --> 00:12:19,880
guys like carter don't change, s.

243
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,340
Ooh! It's them.

244
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,390
Who?

245
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,870
le table Elitaire.They've given me
my initiation instructions.

246
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:28,196
this is it. I gotta go.

247
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:33,036
Oh, and you really are making
a huge mistake. Bye !

248
00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:41,480
Chuck bass for mr. Macpherson.

249
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,990
I apologize, 
but he's going to have to reschedule.

250
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,170
It's devyn, right ?

251
00:12:45,437 --> 00:12:46,850
We spoke earlier.

252
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:50,165
You're, uh, far more beautiful
than i pictured.

253
00:12:52,187 --> 00:12:54,450
I have a m.b. From tuck.

254
00:12:54,735 --> 00:12:56,543
I'm not the coat check girl.

255
00:12:57,496 --> 00:13:01,530
then i'm sure you're aware his club on
63rd isn't doing as well as it could.

256
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,200
Uptown isn't downtown.

257
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,950
I have some ideas he should hear

258
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,040
We get dozens of young guys a week
pitching sean their vision of the future.

259
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,660
That doesn't mean he wants to hear it.

260
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,595
I can be very persuasive.

261
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,550
So were they.

262
00:13:18,888 --> 00:13:20,400
Piece of advice ?

263
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,880
You really want him
to take you seriously ?

264
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:27,551
Find a way to show him
that you respect his past.

265
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,119
At least then you'll have a shot.

266
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:57,166
I just can't believe your parents still
haven't returned your phone calls.

267
00:13:57,216 --> 00:13:59,266
Or e-mails or texts.

268
00:13:59,602 --> 00:14:01,798
I even wrote on my dad's facebook wall.

269
00:14:03,044 --> 00:14:04,365
What do you want to do tonight ?

270
00:14:04,415 --> 00:14:06,040
as much as i enjoy
the low profile thing,

271
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:09,390
it'be nice to at least go somewhere
that has a cash register,maybe.

272
00:14:09,553 --> 00:14:13,000
You mean actually go out together,
Be seen by other people?

273
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,290
Well, yeah. I uld like you
to meet some of my friends.

274
00:14:15,562 --> 00:14:17,393
If they remember who you are.

275
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,594
I held you captive for quite a while.

276
00:14:19,644 --> 00:14:21,555
Ah, but not against my will.

277
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:26,550
All right. Let me see what everyone's
doing tonight.

278
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,750
We'll make our public debut.

279
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:31,670
If your family finds
out d doesn't like it...

280
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,830
Maybe they'll call and complain.

281
00:14:41,744 --> 00:14:42,760
Chuck ?

282
00:14:44,046 --> 00:14:45,750
How did you know i was here?

283
00:14:45,936 --> 00:14:48,080
Did you find me to apologize ?
That is so sweet.

284
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,820
Not exactly, though i am sorry.

285
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,850
I know i've been all work lately

286
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,280
If you didn't find me,
what are you doing here ?

287
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,630
Thers a photograph i need that's up
for auction tonight.

288
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,270
Me, too.
My prayers have been answered.

289
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,540
A secret collegiate society wants me.

290
00:15:03,755 --> 00:15:06,150
Initiation is easy.
All you have to do is contribute

291
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,781
to their salon's art collection
As a fee, so...

292
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,769
You've got to be kidding me.

293
00:15:12,016 --> 00:15:14,030
I'm more of a
helmut newton girl myself,

294
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,470
But they want vintage mcmullan.
Who am i to argue?

295
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,580
You see the guy in this photo ?
That's sean macpherson.

296
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:22,999
He has an entire wall with photos
like this in his office.

297
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,211
Look,procuring this one for him

298
00:15:25,261 --> 00:15:28,450
Is the best way i can show
him i have respect for his history.

299
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,940
Show him respect?

300
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,350
He's a club owner, not a mafia don.

301
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,893
Look, you can buy your "table" people
A wonderful **nry diltz.

302
00:15:37,943 --> 00:15:39,740
le table Elitaire.

303
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:42,900
I only have until midnight tonight.
This is what they asked for.

304
00:15:43,045 --> 00:15:46,710
Look,i'm sorry, but i need this.

305
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,300
you're not getting it...

306
00:15:48,694 --> 00:15:51,054
Or anything else, i might add.

307
00:16:00,037 --> 00:16:01,845
I got your message. What's up ?

308
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,070
I like you...

309
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,940
I like you, too.

310
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,939
That's why i'm gonna give you
30 seconds to explain

311
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:10,224
why there's no scott adler enrolled
at n.y.u.

312
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,980
Look, vanessa, it's complicated.

313
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,960
Let me make it easy for you.
You either tell me the truth, Or we're over.

314
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,270
I lied to you because i had to.

315
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,110
That's not good enough.

316
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:24,586
<i>they say honesty is the best policy...</i>

317
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:27,789
My name is...

318
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:31,059
Ny name isn't adler. It's rosson.

319
00:16:32,815 --> 00:16:35,210
I'm rufus and lily's son.

320
00:16:35,563 --> 00:16:36,650
Oh,my god.

321
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,250
<i>i hope everyone's policies are paid up,</i>

322
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,546
because it looks like
we're on a collision course.

323
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:45,730
My parents told me i was adopted
in middle school,

324
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,770
But it wasn't until this past spring that
i decided to find my biological parents.

325
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:52,480
And when i told my folks
of my intentions,

326
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,560
They said that they'd ready
spoken with them,

327
00:16:54,906 --> 00:16:56,830
And they wanted nothing to do wi me.

328
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,320
They lied to you, scott.

329
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,220
Rufus and lily went looking for you,

330
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,170
And your parents said that
you were dead.

331
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,070
Wait. What ?

332
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,620
Yeah. They said you were killed
in a boating accident.

333
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:11,720
That was my younger brother andrew.

334
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,870
Why would my parents tell them that?

335
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,260
I don't know,but you...
Need to tell rufus who you are.

336
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:21,442
I need to talk to my parents first.

337
00:17:23,473 --> 00:17:26,020
It's been 20 years.
What's a day or two more?

338
00:17:29,905 --> 00:17:31,831
If you have any feelings for me,

339
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:33,872
you won't say anything yet.

340
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:43,680
The card's good, man.
Run it again.

341
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,190
I have, man, three times.

342
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,690
I've been instructed to destroy
it and to call the authorities.

343
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,873
Wait. Just--just wait.
How much for the weekend?

344
00:17:50,923 --> 00:17:52,740
Including your room service bill?

345
00:17:54,486 --> 00:17:55,740
I didn't order any of this.

346
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,100
3 bottles of '95 dom reserve ?
Are you kidding ? I'm not paying for this.

347
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,779
Hey. Hey, what's going on?

348
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,240
Four-star hotels aren't what they
used to be. That's what.

349
00:18:03,405 --> 00:18:06,770
Hey, if you need to use my card,
yocan.

350
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,350
You should aleast pay
for room service.

351
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,150
I didn't order room service.

352
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,343
Carter.

353
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:14,478
You don't believe me.

354
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,080
You didn't with that woman this morning,
and you don't now.

355
00:18:18,234 --> 00:18:19,444
I believe you.

356
00:18:19,886 --> 00:18:20,870
I do.

357
00:18:21,045 --> 00:18:22,950
You'd make a terrible poker player.

358
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,440
I want to believe you've changed.
You're just making it hard for me.

359
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,830
If you don't trust me,
then what are we doing?

360
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:30,157
I'm not sure.

361
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,059
I came to apologize.

362
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:52,880
So apologize.

363
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,920
That was it.
But it comes with a bottle of champagne--

364
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,120
Your favorite vintage,
if i'm not mistaken.

365
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,170
Look, our relationship should
be more important

366
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,520
Than business deals or secret societies.

367
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,760
So what do you propose ?

368
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,050
I propose we don't go to
the auction tonight.

369
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,610
Neither one of **u gets the photograph.
It's the only way.

370
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:11,524
Pity.

371
00:19:12,755 --> 00:19:14,657
I already have my bidding paddle.

372
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:20,271
Well... I'm sure we can find some
other use for it.

373
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:32,822
Hey.

374
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,494
Hey. Thanks for meeting me.

375
00:19:35,694 --> 00:19:37,410
Sorry i sounded so cryptic
on the phone.

376
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,499
No, no. Don't worry about it.
I was having lunch with georgina

377
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,671
A couple blocks away,
so what's up ?

378
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,180
Scott's been lying to everyone.

379
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,200
What ? What--what do you mean ?
About what ?

380
00:19:46,573 --> 00:19:48,208
He's not a student here.

381
00:19:48,258 --> 00:19:50,427
Wait. He's been lying about going
to n.y.u. ?

382
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:53,597
Why--why would anyone do that ?
Have you confronted him?

383
00:19:53,997 --> 00:19:56,610
Vanessa,come on.
He's been pretending to take classes,

384
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,937
Been recommending professors
to you--that is beyond creepy.

385
00:19:58,987 --> 00:20:01,280
You gotta tell me what's going on.

386
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:02,591
Hey.

387
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,660
I'm sorry to interrupt,
But blair actually locked me out,

388
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,140
and by the size Of the sock on
the doorknob, i didn't want to knock.

389
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:14,000
Okay, well, i'm gonna go get
a cup of coffee

390
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,860
and let you guys continue
to stare at each other.

391
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,420
No, i'm--i'm--i'm leaving.

392
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,570
Vanessa, wait. Are--are you gonna come
to the auction tonight ?

393
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,410
Cause my dad wants us all to be there.
We can talk then.

394
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,217
Right. Rufus.
Yeah,i'll-- i'll definitely be there.

395
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,846
I'm a good listener.

396
00:20:34,597 --> 00:20:37,427
Her boyfriend is apparently
lying about going to school here,

397
00:20:37,477 --> 00:20:39,935
and she won't tell me why.

398
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:42,782
Well, she viously likes the guy
and wants to wish for the best.

399
00:20:42,832 --> 00:20:45,705
I mean, it's not exactly unpredented
In affairs of the heart.

400
00:20:45,755 --> 00:20:47,180
So i let it go, doothing ?

401
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,934
No, silly. We find out
who this guy really is.

402
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,013
buckman. Car detailed.

403
00:21:00,063 --> 00:21:01,551
Dorota. Dry cleaning.

404
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:08,357
We've been waiting a wk for this.

405
00:21:08,407 --> 00:21:10,224
- I'm rning them off.
- wait.

406
00:21:12,424 --> 00:21:14,996
"got word photo could go for $5,500" ?

407
00:21:15,046 --> 00:21:16,229
How could you?

408
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:20,130
Hey. G--
"the last mcmullan went for $3,000" ?

409
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,596
I guess dorota's counter intelligence
Isn't what it used to be.

410
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:24,287
Don't chan the subject.

411
00:21:24,337 --> 00:21:26,500
I can't believe you lied to me !

412
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,661
Trying to use sex to distract me.

413
00:21:28,711 --> 00:21:30,434
I learned from the best.

414
00:21:30,587 --> 00:21:32,513
That photograph is mine.

415
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,326
She stole my shoes

416
00:21:40,975 --> 00:21:43,136
Is there anything else that he to you ?

417
00:21:44,507 --> 00:21:45,992
i-i don't know.

418
00:21:46,374 --> 00:21:48,428
He said he played soccer
in high school,

419
00:21:48,478 --> 00:21:49,661
Claimed he was m.v.p.

420
00:21:49,711 --> 00:21:52,503
Soccer. Is there a
team name or a mascot ?

421
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,221
- Uh, yeah, uh, lions.
- Okay.

422
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:58,220
I don't know how i remember that.

423
00:22:02,482 --> 00:22:03,316
Voil ?

424
00:22:03,696 --> 00:22:05,890
least he was honest about sports.

425
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,819
Typical.

426
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:09,982
His last name's not adler.

427
00:22:10,032 --> 00:22:12,659
It's--it's rosson. Does
that mean anything to you ?

428
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:21,229
I figured you'd probably be
halfway back to boston by now.

429
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,728
Oh, i thought about it.

430
00:22:22,778 --> 00:22:23,597
And ?

431
00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:25,832
I thought about you.

432
00:22:26,103 --> 00:22:28,270
I called my parents.
I had it out with them.

433
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,230
I told them what I needed to do,

434
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,581
And they didn't take it very well.

435
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:35,932
I was just hoping that i wouldn't
have to go through telling rufus alone.

436
00:22:40,544 --> 00:22:41,554
You don't.

437
00:22:48,796 --> 00:22:50,041
Scott
rosson--

438
00:22:50,193 --> 00:22:52,800
me that after reading my short
story in "the new yorker."

439
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,806
N letter?

440
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:57,798
So he's kinda like your stalker ?

441
00:22:57,848 --> 00:22:58,649
I guess.

442
00:22:58,699 --> 00:23:00,282
How rock star is that ?

443
00:23:03,088 --> 00:23:05,542
Hey, vanessa.
Uh, it's--it's--it's me.

444
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,914
Look,scott is not who he says.

445
00:23:08,964 --> 00:23:11,380
And i don't know. He--he
could be dangerous.

446
00:23:12,396 --> 00:23:13,863
Um, please call me.

447
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:16,568
So what now ?

448
00:23:17,966 --> 00:23:19,950
She said she was going to the auction.

449
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,368
Do you have plans tonight ?

450
00:23:21,521 --> 00:23:22,378
No.

451
00:23:22,428 --> 00:23:23,773
<i>turns out photographs</i>

452
00:23:23,823 --> 00:23:26,615
<i>won't be the only thing
up for grabs tonight.</i>

453
00:23:26,665 --> 00:23:29,392
<i>a priceless secret is

I ne a photograph that's up for

461
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:32,070
But chuck wants it
for some business deal.

462
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,560
Can you believe that ?

463
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,011
Putting his own happiness above mine ?

464
00:24:36,061 --> 00:24:37,440
What kind  boyfriend does that ?

465
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,550
How is that a healthy relationship ?
Tell me !

466
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,593

the world To satisfy me right now.

468
00:24:44,695 --> 00:24:45,796
M sorry.

469
00:24:45,846 --> 00:24:48,336
If it makes you feel any better,
you were right about carter.

470
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,214
I should have listened to you.

471
00:24:51,212 --> 00:24:52,762
It's for the best, s.

472
00:24:52,812 --> 00:24:54,371
Most guys just are who they are.

473
00:24:54,421 --> 00:24:55,228
hey.

474
00:24:57,603 --> 00:24:59,552
My bottegas--where are they ?

475
00:24:59,602 --> 00:25:01,440
Consider them prisoners war.

476
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,459
They'll be relsed when
i have the photograph.

477
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:06,762
And don't think you can distract
me with another ounce of dom.

478
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,879
So i see you're not with
your,uh,sideck this evening.

479
00:25:12,032 --> 00:25:15,003
It's probably best. This
place doesn't accept i.o.u.s.

480
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,290
some guys just are...

481
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,570
Who they are ?

482
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:21,564
That's exactly what blair just said.

483
00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:35,716
I'm right here, okay ?

484
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,470
Hey ! I dn't think you guys
were coming.

Sorry. 
Could you give me one second ?

490
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,511
I need to double-check

491
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:50,961
I'll be right back.

492

00:25:59,374 --> 00:26:01,757
Don't worry.
It's--it's a long night.

00:26:02,015 --> 00:26:03,140
There's still time.

495
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,625
No, it's not that.

496
00:26:08,383 --> 00:26:09,592
Who is she?

497
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,800
That's my mother.

498
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:18,486

I don't,and no,i'm not.
- $7,400...

516
00:27:03,347 --> 00:27:05,962
I need that society.
You don't turn down destiny.

517
00:27:06,012 --> 00:27:08,551
It's not destiny if you
have to barter your way in.

518
00:27:08,601 --> 00:27:09,870
You'repecial enough
on your own.

519
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,475
You don't need some
group to say you are.

520
00:27:11,525 --> 00:27:12,496
And what about you ?

521
00:27:12,546 --> 00:27:14,915
Since when does chuck
bass pay for a partner ?

522
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:17,571
The chuck i knew bribed no one but me.

523
00:27:17,724 --> 00:27:21,986
Sold. $7,500 to 9-1-5.
thank you very much.

524
00:27:22,585 --> 00:27:23,888

525
00:27:25,027 --> 00:27:26,272
What are you doing here ?

526
00:27:26,322 --> 00:27:27,788
Is--is dad here, too?

527
00:27:27,838 --> 00:27:28,669
No.

528
00:27:29,092 --> 00:27:30,660
After your phone call,
i got in the car.

529
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,797
I came straight to new york.
I had lily's address.

530
00:27:32,847 --> 00:27:34,590
The doorman told me about the auction.

531
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,700
You know,if you came here
to stop me,you wasted a trip.

532
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,345
I'm not here to stop you.

533
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,151
I'm here to stand by you.

534
00:27:43,102 --> 00:27:45,979
When they came looking for
you so soon after andrew,

535
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:48,611
The thought of losing you, too...

536
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:51,279
I told your father
to lie. It's my fault.

537
00:27:51,561 --> 00:27:54,027
And that's w i'm here
tonight, to tell you...

538
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,485
you're my son.

539
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:59,082
Sweetie...

540
00:27:59,716 --> 00:28:00,726
I love you.

541
00:28:01,841 --> 00:28:03,877
And if this is what you need to do,

542
00:28:06,014 --> 00:28:07,482
then we support you.

543
00:28:12,973 --> 00:28:14,241
This is my kind of date.

544
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:16,566
Racing to an art auction to
confront a possible stalker ?

545
00:28:16,616 --> 00:28:18,656
What,was your last boyfriend batman?

546
00:28:18,706 --> 00:28:20,482
Admit it. You're having fun.

547
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:22,689
Dad. Thank god.

548
00:28:22,739 --> 00:28:25,038
Hey, we need to find vanessa and scott.

549
00:28:25,088 --> 00:28:26,700
I was just with them. Why ?

550
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,417
- Scott is.
- We think he could be n's stalker.

551
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:31,670
Hi. Georgina sparks.

552
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:34,220
Yeah, you may remember
me as--as sarah,

553
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,430
But, um, it's nice to see you again, sir.

554
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,170
Do y remember my fan
letter from last year?

555
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,100
That was him. He'seen
using a different last name.

556
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,530
He's been lying about going to school,

557
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,950
And he's been befriending all of us.

558
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,310
Yeah. No, he could be dangerous.

559
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,260
Dangerous ?

560
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,605
He's not. He just wants to talk to you.

561
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:49,049
Talk to me about what ?

562
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:50,824
He'll explain everything.

563
00:28:51,341 --> 00:28:53,513
Scott, uh, what's going on ?

564
00:28:53,563 --> 00:28:55,345
I haven't told you the truth.

565
00:28:56,308 --> 00:28:59,091
My last name is...Rosson.

566
00:28:59,943 --> 00:29:01,223
This is my mom.

567
00:29:07,582 --> 00:29:11,500
I'm your son's brother,
Andrew's brother, And i,

568
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,523
uh,just really wanted to meet you.

569
00:29:17,767 --> 00:29:20,703
<i>Sorry, vanessa.
looks like the price of truth</i>

570
00:29:20,753 --> 00:29:23,251
<i>was just too rich for scott's blood.</i>

571
00:29:27,258 --> 00:29:28,667
S., what are you doing ?

572
00:29:28,717 --> 00:29:31,156
What are you guys
doing sabotaging carter ?

573
00:29:31,206 --> 00:29:34,203
3 bottles of '95 dom on his
hotel room service bill--

574
00:29:34,253 --> 00:29:36,093
One of your favorites,if i recall.

575
00:29:36,143 --> 00:29:39,358
So we started a stealth campaign
to destroy his credibility.

576
00:29:39,408 --> 00:29:41,991
****

577
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:43,835
- The warrant ?
- Wath warrant ?

578
00:29:43,885 --> 00:29:45,608
Well, he might want to
take a d.n.a. Sample

579
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,803
Down to the 24th precinct tomorrow

580
00:29:47,988 --> 00:29:50,395
The point is i did it to protecyou.

581
00:29:50,445 --> 00:29:52,520
Me ? Just hate the guy.

582
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,312
All carter cares about is himself.

583
00:29:55,511 --> 00:29:57,789
When we ran him out
of town six months ago,

584
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,154
He traded his dubai ticket for greece.

585
00:30:00,412 --> 00:30:01,200
Greece ?

586
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,070
Spent the next few
months checking in d out

587
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,084
Of every resort and
hotel from there to fiji.

588
00:30:05,134 --> 00:30:07,432
He only came back because he wasroke.

589
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,026
He went looking for him.

590
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:12,184
- Who ?
- My father.

591
00:30:12,689 --> 00:30:16,435
I found out he was getting remarried,
Two years ago, in santorini.

592
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,031
Finally. What happened in santorini.

593
00:30:20,377 --> 00:30:22,932
I wanted to see him,but i
didn't want anyone to know,

594
00:30:22,982 --> 00:30:24,615
*********

595
00:30:24,665 --> 00:30:26,235
******

596
00:30:26,285 --> 00:30:28,570
When the police picked us
up on the way to the wedding,

597
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,703
I realized "access" meant sten.

598
00:30:30,753 --> 00:30:32,650
Carter promised he'd make it up to me.

599
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,751
I had no idea he's been
looking for my father himself.

600
00:30:36,373 --> 00:30:37,735
And did he find him ?

601
00:30:37,785 --> 00:30:39,356
You know,i have to go.

602
00:30:42,804 --> 00:30:45,223
fine. I'll call my guy at t precinct.

603
00:30:52,054 --> 00:30:54,849
I don't understand why you didn't

604
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:57,197
*********

605
00:30:57,247 --> 00:30:59,515
I wasn't even sure what
i would say if you did.

606
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:01,390
Hey, let's just, uh,
let's go back to the house,

607
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,403
You and your mom, and we'll
get to know Ea other better.

608
00:31:03,453 --> 00:31:06,214
No, i'd like that, it's just... In time.

609
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,010
For now,i think this is a good first sp.

610
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,574
U got--you got a great family,
mr. Humphrey,

611
00:31:10,727 --> 00:31:14,167
And my brother wld have been
proud to know you, all of you.

612
00:31:17,866 --> 00:31:18,990
Thanks, scott.

613
00:31:24,356 --> 00:31:26,552
You don't know how
much that means to me.

614
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:42,644
I'm sorry,s. But it's still carter.

615
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:44,616
Are you sure it's worth the risk ?

616
00:31:44,816 --> 00:31:46,495
I don't know. You tell me.

617
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:51,492
You and chuck are twO of the most
self-centered,damaged people i know.

618
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:52,420
I'm not following.

619
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:55,784
Well,somehow two wrongs
make a twisted right.

620
00:31:55,834 --> 00:31:58,027
You don't think it was worth the risk ?

621
00:31:58,802 --> 00:32:01,150
Here. You know what to do with this.

622
00:32:08,308 --> 00:32:09,399
Damn him.

623
00:32:18,058 --> 00:32:19,831
You've got to be kidding me.

624
00:32:28,664 --> 00:32:30,144
I want you to have this.

625
00:32:30,194 --> 00:32:31,048
Why ?

626
00:32:31,565 --> 00:32:33,120
Because i love you,

627
00:32:34,694 --> 00:32:37,820
You enormously stubborn pain in the ass.

628
00:32:40,615 --> 00:32:42,705
And what abo la table élitaire?

629
00:32:43,104 --> 00:32:44,584
What about them?

630
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,506
I believe in you.

631
00:32:51,206 --> 00:32:53,649
D if this is what it takes
for you to believe in you,

632
00:32:53,699 --> 00:32:54,521
Then...

633
00:32:56,681 --> 00:32:57,844
it's worth it.

634
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:11,038
<i>in a bidding war,even wheyou win,</i>

635
00:33:11,088 --> 00:33:14,890
<i>what you thought you wanted
can suddenly be reappraised...</i>

636
00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:18,422
Does le table itaire
even exist, georgina ?

637
00:33:18,472 --> 00:33:20,782
I'm sorry, but my french
is a little rusty.

638
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,730
Maybe you should start with
 "excusez-moi."

639
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,150
you know,i should have
recoized your "g"

640
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,630
When blair first showed
me the invitation.

641
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,471
It has caused me enough
trouble in the past.

642
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:30,518
le tab itaire does exist.

643
00:33:30,568 --> 00:33:32,244
My friend devyn was
a member in dartmouth.

644
00:33:32,294 --> 00:33:36,366
Although i doubt the n.y.u. Chapter
Has ever hrd of blair waldorf

645
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:38,186
If there even is an n.y.u. Chapter.

646
00:33:38,236 --> 00:33:40,792
Oh, good. So you haven't changed at all.

647
00:33:40,842 --> 00:33:42,119
What about dan ?

648
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:45,235
Dan is dan. But when it
comes to blair waldorf,

649
00:33:45,285 --> 00:33:47,950
I don't have to do much
but sit back,lit a match

650
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,544
And watch her go up in flames.

651
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,999
Well, if you keep pushing her,
she will push back,

652
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:55,043
And whenhe does, i will
be right behind her.

653
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:58,178
Now we've had enough of you tonight.

654
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:03,929
<i>other times,old opponents
resurface to raise the stakes...</i>

655
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:11,110
I thought after the night
we've had, we'd hit morondi's--

656
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,544
Some lemon spaghetti,some
fried artickes.

657
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:16,157
Did someone say food ? I'm starving.

658
00:34:16,207 --> 00:34:17,906
T me just find georgina.

659
00:34:18,305 --> 00:34:20,590
Oh, you know what ?
Don't bother. Um, she already left.

660
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,121
She said she had a
headache or something.

661
00:34:22,171 --> 00:34:23,049
What ? Oh, okay.

662
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:25,625
It's kind of weird she didn't say
good-bye. I should--i'll call her.

663
00:34:25,675 --> 00:34:27,633
Tomorrow. We'll talk first.

664
00:34:28,643 --> 00:34:30,254
How about it, vanessa ? You hungry ?

665
00:34:30,304 --> 00:34:32,220
<i>but it's the things we walk away from</i>

666
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,758
<i>that feel like they cost the most.</i>

667
00:34:34,808 --> 00:34:35,838
Let's go.

668
00:34:36,413 --> 00:34:39,212
<i>and yet,it's when we've been outbid,</i>

669
00:34:39,262 --> 00:34:42,171
<i>forced to watch our prize
go home with others,</i>

670
00:34:42,221 --> 00:34:45,470
<i>that the rules oprotocol
no longer apply.</i>

671
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:50,440
<i>i wouldn't put your
paddles away just yet.</i>

672
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:53,754
<i>who knows what bidders will
do wh they're desperate ?</i>

673
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,032
Hey. Glad u called.

674
00:34:56,244 --> 00:34:58,243
Do you want to do something today ?

675
00:34:58,407 --> 00:35:00,333
Oh, you know, i can't.

676
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:01,190
Oh.

677
00:35:02,411 --> 00:35:04,231
Serena told you
about blair and chuck.

678
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:06,263
Yeah. Yeah, she did.

679
00:35:06,427 --> 00:35:08,658
Look,i-i sent that
invitation out last week,

680
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:10,560
Before you and i got together.

681
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,568
But it'slair and chuck.

682
00:35:12,618 --> 00:35:15,022
I mean,talk about a viimless crime.

683
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,040
Yeah, i--yeah, i know. that's

684
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,975
But i really think we should
cool things off for a while,

685
00:35:20,025 --> 00:35:21,901
You know, take a--
take a little break ?

686
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:23,474
A break ? Already ?

687
00:35:23,524 --> 00:35:25,212
Well,we did say no strings.

688
00:35:25,262 --> 00:35:26,088
Right.

689
00:35:26,522 --> 00:35:27,708
No strings.

690
00:35:28,812 --> 00:35:30,021
I'll see you later.

691
00:35:30,071 --> 00:35:30,925
Okay.

692
00:35:34,694 --> 00:35:35,551
Sorry.

693
00:35:35,857 --> 00:35:37,791
I thought you should know
that she hadn't changed.

694
00:35:37,841 --> 00:35:40,245
No, you--you did the
right thing to tell me.

695
00:35:40,295 --> 00:35:43,322
And speaking of, uh, change...

696
00:35:44,485 --> 00:35:47,726
Yeah,i left carter, like, a
dozen messages.

697
00:35:47,776 --> 00:35:49,757
He doesn't want anything to do wh me.

698
00:35:49,922 --> 00:35:53,001
I-i highly doubt that. You're
a pretty tou one to shake.

699
00:35:55,244 --> 00:35:59,400
Well, maybe if i didn't believe in him
He is right to shake me.

700
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:01,807
You know,i think my dad
is attempting crepes.

701
00:36:01,857 --> 00:36:04,476
We might want to check
the smoke alarms.

702
00:36:04,526 --> 00:36:05,594
Good plan.

703
00:36:08,616 --> 00:36:10,647
So how'd it work?

704
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,348
You happen to mention
our meeting to georgina,

705
00:36:13,398 --> 00:36:15,250
And she hatched up a
plan to cause trouble

706
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,801
Between me and my girlfriend?

707
00:36:16,851 --> 00:36:18,374
Georgie and i go back.

708
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:22,190
The girl has an m.b.a.
In deviant behavior.

709
00:36:23,317 --> 00:36:25,724
And you're going to need
a better sense of humor

710
00:36:25,774 --> 00:36:27,406
In the club business.

711
00:36:31,304 --> 00:36:33,324
- Nice photo.
- Thanks.

712
00:36:35,684 --> 00:36:37,920
Chuck bass. Big fan.

713
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,153
By the way,

714
00:36:39,203 --> 00:36:43,086
When your lease at the
empire hotel Isn't renewed,

715
00:36:43,662 --> 00:36:45,693
Thank bright eyes here.

716
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,052
Thanks for seeing me.

717
00:37:01,102 --> 00:37:03,000
I wanted to say od-bye
before i left for boston.

718
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,047
Don't thank me yet.

719
00:37:05,752 --> 00:37:07,947
You can't ask me to keep this secret.

720
00:37:07,997 --> 00:37:09,773
Rufus and lily gave me up.

721
00:37:10,384 --> 00:37:12,028
Now that was their choice.

722
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,930
I don't blame them for that,

723
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,860
But i think that this
time,this choice should be mine.

724
00:37:22,735 --> 00:37:24,027
promise me that...

725
00:37:25,448 --> 00:37:27,432
You'll come back one day and tellhem.

726
00:37:30,393 --> 00:37:31,672
I can't do that.

727
00:38:04,668 --> 00:38:05,921
I'm really glad u came.

728
00:38:05,971 --> 00:38:07,140
What do you want, serena ?

729
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,428
It was chuck and blair--
the girl on the street,

730
00:38:09,478 --> 00:38:11,213
Your room service, your credit card.

731
00:38:11,263 --> 00:38:13,510
Yeah,i sorta put that tother yesterday.

732
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,660
- You did ?
- When it comes to an eye for an eye,

733
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,466
Chuck's a man of the cloth.

734
00:38:17,737 --> 00:38:20,789
Plus,having spent so
much time with blair,

735
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:22,844
The '95 dom was kind of a tell.

736
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,540
So why didn't you say anything ?

737
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,187
I did. I told you it wasn't me.

738
00:38:28,749 --> 00:38:30,241
I'm noaint, serena.

739
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:33,294
If you're looking for the
first excuse to bolt, trust me,

740
00:38:33,846 --> 00:38:35,337
You're gonna find one.

741
00:38:35,387 --> 00:38:39,364
For my sake, i figured
sooner was better than later.

742
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:48,696
I'm not looking for an excus anymore.

743
00:38:48,746 --> 00:38:50,645
Who says the offer's still on the table?

744
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,958
Now who'd make a terrible poker player ?

745
00:38:54,022 --> 00:38:56,640
Come on. Will you eat
breakfast with my family ?

746
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,920
Hey. We're gonna need an extra seat.

747
00:39:03,354 --> 00:39:04,975
Hi. How you doing ?

748
00:39:05,162 --> 00:39:06,477
Ah, fresh crepes.

749
00:39:15,077 --> 00:39:17,167
You said you wanted to talk.

750
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:18,693
Why here ?

751
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,642
I just came from sean
macpherson's office.

752
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:25,330
I wanted to thank his assistant.

753
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:27,784
She did me a favor.

754
00:39:28,653 --> 00:39:30,488
I was thinking too small.

755
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:35,407
Why settle for some club...

756
00:39:36,077 --> 00:39:37,227
In a hotel...

757
00:39:38,426 --> 00:39:40,622
When you can just buy the hotel?

758
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,524
Chuck...

759
00:39:43,052 --> 00:39:45,600
A club is one thing, but a hotel?

760
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:49,097
I've been meeting with the board
of bass industries all morning.

761
00:39:49,147 --> 00:39:51,598
I told them i want to
cash my shares out...

762
00:39:52,643 --> 00:39:53,898
Risk it all,

763
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:55,366
On my own.

764
00:39:57,738 --> 00:39:59,499
They think i've lost my mind.

765
00:39:59,549 --> 00:40:00,979
- have you ?
- No.

766
00:40:02,857 --> 00:40:04,908
Then how can you be so sure ?

767
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,648
Because you believe in me

768
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:21,857
Now... I booked the penthouse for us.

769
00:40:22,198 --> 00:40:24,805
What do you say we chrisn my legacy?

770
00:40:26,331 --> 00:40:28,657
Or do you need to be bribed?

771
00:40:35,187 --> 00:40:36,021
Bye.

772
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,005
Carter baizen.

773
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:47,459
Bree buckley.

774
00:40:47,509 --> 00:40:50,195
Heard through the grapevine
you were back in new york

775
00:40:50,395 --> 00:40:53,440
And dating serena van der woodsen,
no less.

776
00:40:53,669 --> 00:40:55,794
- At do you want ?
- Are you kidding ?

777
00:40:56,182 --> 00:40:58,976
I'm headed home to face
the family firing squad.

778
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:00,710
Considering what you did to us,

779
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,262
being able to find you is gonna go
a long way in getting me back in.

780
00:41:04,312 --> 00:41:05,683
I'm sure they'll be in touch.

781
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:08,801
Oh, and, um, go ahead and run,
if you want.

782
00:41:09,176 --> 00:41:11,536
You know how mh daddy loves to hunt.

783
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:24,368
Yes. When's the next train to boston ?

784
00:41:25,518 --> 00:41:26,375
Thanks.

785
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,598
<i>anyone want to start the
bidding on what happens next ?</i>

786
