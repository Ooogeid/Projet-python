of the Manhattan's elite.</i>

3
00:00:05,944 --> 00:00:07,429
I really think we should
cool things off for a while,

4
00:00:07,479 --> 00:00:08,510
you know, take a...
take a little break ?

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,560
- We did say no strings.
- right. No strings.

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,348
You either tell me the truth,
or we're over.

7
00:00:13,398 --> 00:00:15,210
I'm Rufus and Lily's son.

8
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,150
Georgina, hey.
I'll be there in a second.

9
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,100
Things were so much easier
when we were younger.

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,487
We just jumped into things.
Why can't we just be more like that ?

11
00:00:22,663 --> 00:00:24,200
Marry me, Lily.

12
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,314
The next time you forget
you're Blair Waldorf,

13
00:00:26,364 --> 00:00:28,800
remember I'm Chuck Bass,
and I love you.

14
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,835
Scott, what's going on ?

15
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:31,980
I haven't told you the truth.
I'm your son's brother.

16
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,400
If you're looking for
the first excuse to bolttrust me,

17
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,910
- you're gonna find one.
- I'm not looking for an excuse anymore.

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,841
I didn't really give
you a chance to know

19
00:00:38,891 --> 00:00:41,659
both sides of me,
and I'm wondering if you still want to.

20
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:42,610
I don't even know

21
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,117
why I'm pretending to think about it.
Yes. Yes, of course.

22
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:46,582
- this is your fault.
- That's not fair.

23
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:48,740
Not fair ?
I go away to take care of my mother,

24
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,677
and I come back and my daughter
is not going to college.

25
00:00:50,727 --> 00:00:52,950
I'm headed home to face
the family firing squad.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,510
Considering what you did to us,
being able to find you is

27
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,050
gonna go a long way.
Go ahead and run if you want.

28
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,915
You know how much
daddy loves to hunt.

Toasted blueberry ?
You spoil me.

43
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,280
Dorota offered to make eggs,

44
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,178
but I thought it was the duty
of the devoted lover to provide.

45
00:02:14,483 --> 00:02:15,528
I missed you.

46
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:18,798
Yeah, you showed me just how
much when I got in last night.

47
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:22,700
So how was your trip ?

48
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,836
Did you get your money back
from your poker buddy ?

49
00:02:24,886 --> 00:02:26,819
No. And I would have let it slide,

50
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:28,900
but with my parents cutting me off...
- trust me. I get it.

51
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,148
Working for K.C.
is nowhere near as lucrative

52
00:02:31,198 --> 00:02:32,815
as being Lily Bass'daughter.

53
00:02:32,968 --> 00:02:35,850
For now,
toaster pastries are all I can afford.

54
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:38,500
Go go. Talk to her... for me.

55
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,331
Fine.

56
00:02:40,918 --> 00:02:42,622
But then you have to
do something for me.

57
00:02:42,672 --> 00:02:44,324
Take my place at dim sum with
my friends.

58
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:45,766
Dumplings with Blair and Chuck ?

59
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:48,156
And Nate. You can do some recon.

60
00:02:48,206 --> 00:02:49,882
Blair hates Nate's new girlfriend.

61
00:02:49,932 --> 00:02:51,526
You can find out if
she's really that bad.

62
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:54,550
I bet bree is perfectly nice,
even though she is a Buckley.

63
00:02:59,465 --> 00:03:00,707
Um, unfortunately,

64
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:03,749
I-I do have more, um,
people who owe me money to talk to.

65
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:05,322
Fine.

66
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:07,446
Eat up.

67
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:16,870
One second. I'm telling Olivia
to say hi to Godzilla from me.

68
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,666
It's funny, right ?

69
00:03:18,716 --> 00:03:20,732
More so than your awful sushi puns.

70
00:03:21,014 --> 00:03:22,571
Well, I'm a terrible I.M. flirter,

71
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,877
but as long as Olivia's
on this Asian press tour,

72
00:03:24,927 --> 00:03:26,803
I have... I have no choice.
And anyway, you know,

73
00:03:26,853 --> 00:03:28,693
"sashimi later" is charming.

74
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:30,266
Why are you using
my screen name again ?

75
00:03:30,316 --> 00:03:32,978
Because every time I log on,
Georgina pounces on my I.M.

76
00:03:33,028 --> 00:03:34,783
I broke up with her.
I don't know how much more clear

77
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,181
about my feelings I can be.

78
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:38,723
you could tell her you're dating
someone else.

79
00:03:38,905 --> 00:03:40,440
We all live on the same floor, Dan.

80
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,131
When she gets back,
she's gonna figure it out.

81
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,381
Point taken. I'll e-mail her later.

82
00:03:44,526 --> 00:03:45,712
You talked to Scott at all ?

83
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,116
I called him last week,
but he hasn't called me back.

84
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,620
I guess he didn't like me that much.
- Really ?

85
00:03:50,892 --> 00:03:52,136
It didn't seem like that.

86
00:03:52,324 --> 00:03:53,943
I m sorry.
I mean, I know you really liked him.

87
00:03:53,993 --> 00:03:55,900
I did, too, actually, I guess,

88
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,622
'cause in a weird way,
we were kind of related.

89
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:00,572
You know,
I'm gonna hit the Bleecker.

90
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:03,208
- Do... do you want a coffee ?
- No, no, no. You go.

91
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,630
Oh. The...
the toilets in Tokyo talk.

92
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,230
- Hi. Um, I'll have a nonfat latte.
- Sure.

93
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:17,817
Hi. Did you miss me ?

94
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:20,873
Georgina.

<i>The bloodsucker is back.</i>

96
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:26,749
I saw her coffin and telltale
Louis Vuitton broom on the floor.

97
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,945
Vampires don't ride brooms, Blair.

98
00:04:28,995 --> 00:04:31,055
Leave it to Georgina to start
a mutant strain.

99
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:33,773
You know, my roommate
and I didn't see eye to eye at first,

100
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:35,982
so one night I bought
ice cream cone cupcakes

101
00:04:36,032 --> 00:04:37,344
from the treats truck,
and we bonded.

102
00:04:37,394 --> 00:04:39,827
She taught me how to say
"hello" in Swahili. Jambo.

103
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:42,775
Aw. Do you happen to
know what the SwahilI is

104
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:45,146
for "mind your own beeswax" ?
No reason, of course.

105
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:46,721
It just might be useful
someday on safari.

106
00:04:46,771 --> 00:04:49,082
Blair, So, Bree,
you went home last week ?

107
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:51,830
Yeah. Tried to mend the
I'm- dating-a-Van Der bilt fence.

108
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:52,891
It didn't work.

109
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:55,133
We're southern, so family loyalty's
really big down there.

110
00:04:55,183 --> 00:04:56,350
Like slavery.

111
00:04:58,134 --> 00:04:59,755
What ? I'm joking.

112
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:02,376
You know I'm joking, right, Bree ?

113
00:05:03,407 --> 00:05:05,129
So what's Serena doing ?
She still dating Baizen

114
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,950
- or she come to her senses yet ?
- Carter Baizen ? Is he in town ?

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,160
- I-I-I heard he was away on business.
- He is. Traveling is so important.

116
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,134
Bree, have you ever
thought about traveling...

117
00:05:14,184 --> 00:05:15,838
Somewhere very far away ?

118
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:17,935
I wasn't aware you knew Carter.

119
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,904
Yeah. Our families used to
vacation together on sea island.

120
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,204
I've been trying to track him down.

121
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:26,200
You guys mind if
I order for the table ?

122
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,834
She was in Shanghai last year.

124
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:32,403
Nate doesn't like tofu
when it's called bean curd,

125
00:05:32,453 --> 00:05:34,707
and he hasn't eaten pork
since he saw "babe,"

126
00:05:34,757 --> 00:05:35,682
with me.

127
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:41,164
Well, okay, um,
I'll let you guys fend for yourself.

128
00:05:41,214 --> 00:05:42,493
- Hmm ?
- If you'll excuse me.

129
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:48,160
- Blair.
- What ?

130
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,712
I'll go apologize for my girlfriend.

131
00:05:53,142 --> 00:05:54,532
So you're happy with Chuck.

132
00:05:54,582 --> 00:05:57,278
- Don't I deserve to be happy as well ?
- Trust me, Nate.

133
00:05:57,466 --> 00:06:01,059
I know women,
and none of us are that nice.

134
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:04,760
He'll be back soon.

135
00:06:05,716 --> 00:06:06,890
He's in love.

136
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:10,552
You're looking for Carter ?

137
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:12,931
The worm is dating my stepsister.

138
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:15,519
Look, if he's done something to you,
I need to know.

139
00:06:15,671 --> 00:06:18,756
Any enemy of Carter's
is a friend of mine.

140
00:06:19,484 --> 00:06:20,881
I can't really talk about it,

141
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:24,092
but, uh, you should tell
your stepsister to be careful.

142
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,133
Oh, and, uh,

143
00:06:28,225 --> 00:06:30,327
if the worm pops out of the ground,

144
00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:32,300
let me know, okay ?

145
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:53,430
That was, by far,
your best wedding...

146
00:06:53,624 --> 00:06:55,205
The flowers, the foie gras.

147
00:06:55,255 --> 00:06:57,213
Who would have guessed
nine months later,

Klaus would haveaufd ?

149
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:02,224
Well, the worst thing is
I thought he would make me happy.

150
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:04,739
I thought all of them would.

151
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:07,883
What are you doing here ?

152
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:10,900
I wanted to clear the air.
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,674
I know that you're disappointed
that I'm not going to Brown,

154
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,780
and I know that you're
angry that I left.

155
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,459
I'm not angry at you, Serena.

156
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:19,974
I should have been here this summer

157
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:22,166
to help you with the decision
instead of leaving you here

158
00:07:22,216 --> 00:07:24,706
with yet another man
who doesn't get it.

159
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,997
Mom, what are you talking about ?
You and Rufus are the perfect couple.

160
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:32,073
Thank you for stopping by.

161
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,525
Hey, what's going on with
mom and Rufus ?

162
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:43,379
Oh, you didn't know ?

163
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,278
They've been in a cold war since
the day you left.

164
00:07:45,328 --> 00:07:46,193
Over Brown ?

165
00:07:46,243 --> 00:07:49,065
Oh, on the surface, yeah,
but I have a feeling

166
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:50,826
Mom's flipping out about
other things, too.

167
00:07:50,876 --> 00:07:52,681
Yeah, I think they could be
in real trouble.

168
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:56,803
Dad, hey. What are you doing here ?

169
00:08:02,472 --> 00:08:03,502
I've been running.

170
00:08:03,552 --> 00:08:05,433
You've been running with jeans on ?

171
00:08:05,483 --> 00:08:06,982
They didn't chafe ?

172
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,044
If you don't mind, I... I need to sleep
in my own bed tonight...

173
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:13,721
Maybe longer.

174
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:24,747
Dan, hey.

175
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:27,547
Yeah, hey, listen.
Um, I know that my dad and Lily

176
00:08:27,597 --> 00:08:29,038
have been having
a rough go of it lately,

177
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:32,513
but, uh,
things may have taken a turn.

178
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,932
He's spending the night here.

179
00:08:33,982 --> 00:08:35,100
Oh, no.

180
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:37,400
They... they just need
to sit down and talk,

181
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,455
remind themselves of how
much they love each other,

182
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:41,709
before this gets any
more out of hand.

183
00:08:44,406 --> 00:08:45,988
I... I'm gonna figure out a way.

184
00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:48,058
Okay ? I... I promise.

185
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:54,475
Why won't he respond to any
of my calls or... or texts

186
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:56,198
or my animated e-cards ?

187
00:08:56,668 --> 00:08:57,698
Are you serious ?

188
00:08:57,748 --> 00:09:00,735
The last one I sent him was
this adorable singing dog.

189
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:03,358
Okay, Dan didn't write you back,

190
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:05,822
because "A," he broke up with you,

191
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,450
"B," he's seeing someone else,

192
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,476
and "C," even though
I tried to defend you,

193
00:09:09,526 --> 00:09:11,589
you're a full-on crazy person.

194
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:13,797
Wait.
Can we go back to "B" for a second ?

195
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:16,351
He can't be seeing someone else,

196
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:18,550
because we just broke up and...

197
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,144
Okay.

198
00:09:24,002 --> 00:09:25,450
Then you're gonna
get Dan to dump her.

199
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,381
And why in the world
would I do that ?

200
00:09:27,431 --> 00:09:30,983
I didn't visit my family last week.
I was in Boston.

201
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:34,032
You know, I met the sweetest guy.
I think you know him.

202
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,500
- Scott Rosson ?
- Oh, my God.

203
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,550
He just had so much on his mind,

204
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,730
and after several glasses of wine,
slightly enhanced,

205
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,859
- you wouldn't believe what he told me.
- What are you saying, Georgina ?

206
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:46,700
Get Dan to dump the whore,

207
00:09:46,855 --> 00:09:49,110
or I'm gonna tell
the whole world scott's secret.

208
00:09:49,345 --> 00:09:53,903
And that would be too bad, because "a,"
that's the last thing he wants,

209
00:09:53,953 --> 00:09:56,800
"b," how do you think
Dan's gonna feel

210
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,750
when he finds out you've
known his brother's been alive

211
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,473
the whole time ?

212
00:10:01,523 --> 00:10:03,890
And "c," who are you
gonna hang out with

213
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,898
when all the Humphreys hate you ?

214
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,986
Should we review "b" again ?

215
00:10:09,244 --> 00:10:12,337
<i>Some say love's
a secret you keep sealed.</i>

216
00:10:12,794 --> 00:10:14,630
<i>But to Georgina Sparks,</i>

217
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,860
<i>love's always a battlefield.</i>

218
00:10:17,647 --> 00:10:19,040
All right, so what's the emergency ?

219
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,365
Dan, I hate to be
the one to tell you this,

220
00:10:21,415 --> 00:10:24,920
but according to the, uh,
Star, Olivia's been spotted

221
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,181
all over Japan canoodling with...
Orlando Bloom.

222
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:30,583
You know, I'm not... I'm not worried.
They're apparently very good friends.

223
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:32,203
So, uh, am I on speaker ?

224
00:10:32,253 --> 00:10:35,237
Also, uh,
US Weekly has her on baby bump watch.

225
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:37,182
Probably just bloat,
but I thought you'd want to know,

226
00:10:37,232 --> 00:10:38,920
especially with the
Orlando Bloom connection.

227
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,056
Since when do you read
gossip magazines ?

228
00:10:41,397 --> 00:10:44,402
They're Olivia's.
She subscribes to both,

229
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:47,293
which also speaks a lot to her
character, don't you think ?

230
00:10:47,343 --> 00:10:49,779
Look, Vanessa,
I don't believe that, obviously,

231
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:53,169
And... and neither do you, So what are...
what are you trying to tell me here ?

232
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:56,474
I was thinking,
don't you think that dating a movie star

233
00:10:56,524 --> 00:10:59,396
is gonna be kind of hard ? I mean,
wouldn't you rather be with someone...

234
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:01,001
from New York ?

235
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:05,389
- who you have history with ?
- Look, I don't know if you're joking

236
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:07,880
or if Lenny made Brownies
for your floor again,

237
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,403
But, uh, I'm... I'm kind of in
the middle of something here,

238
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:12,387
So, uh, we'll talk later.
All right ?

239
00:11:14,163 --> 00:11:16,594
that was just pathetic.
Haven't you ever tried

240
00:11:16,644 --> 00:11:18,484
to get somebody to dump
a celebrity before ?

241
00:11:18,534 --> 00:11:19,435
- No.

242
00:11:21,032 --> 00:11:21,983
That's okay.

243
00:11:22,488 --> 00:11:23,674
Plan "b."

244
00:11:23,873 --> 00:11:26,250
You're familiar with photoshop,
I presume.

245
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,946
This is a great idea, guys.
I needed some family time.

246
00:11:29,996 --> 00:11:33,508
- Let's order.
- Uh, no, no. I'm still deciding.

247
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:34,659
Jenny, you've eaten
the same thing here

248
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:36,054
every time since you were 11.
What's going on ?

249
00:11:36,104 --> 00:11:37,999
Well, if KC is texting you,
you should go.

250
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:38,996
I will in a minute.

251
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:40,950
Well, the three of us can
do family lunch anytime.

252
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,373
Some other...

253
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:45,765
You're kidding.

254
00:11:45,815 --> 00:11:48,278
I knew I let you kids watch
"The Parent Trap" too many times.

255
00:11:48,328 --> 00:11:49,664
It's time for you two to talk.

256
00:11:49,714 --> 00:11:51,752
- You love each other.
- And it's not Rufus'fault

257
00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:53,643
that I made
the decision not to to Brown

258
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:55,451
Can you please sit down for us ?

259
00:11:58,276 --> 00:12:00,988
I do love the bolognese here.

260
00:12:11,553 --> 00:12:12,880
I can't believe
that actually worked.

261
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,768
I know. I'm a genius,
which doesn't quite explain

262
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,340
why I'll be spending the day
reorganizing KC's shoe closet.

263
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,325
Gotta go.

264
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,946
<i>Carter is not who you think he is.</i>

265
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:27,366
<i>And I know you don't
like to discuss this,</i>

266
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,598
<i>but he wasn't the cause of my spiral,
just a symptom.</i>

267
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:32,440
And he makes Serena truly happy.

268
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:35,666
What is this ? It's incredible.

269
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:38,522
Buntautuk. I learned it
from a master in Chiang Mai.

270
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:40,342
Serena's deluded.

271
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,744
The guy's not capable
of genuine feelings.

272
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:45,705
He's brought out
a different side of her.

273
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:47,761
They're all happy and domestic,

274
00:12:47,811 --> 00:12:50,229
nested up at my mother's. Ohh !

275
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,047
Carter's at your penthouse ?

276
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:54,911
Why wouldn't you tell
Bree that when she asked ?

277
00:12:55,228 --> 00:12:56,766
He got in last night.

278
00:12:56,816 --> 00:12:58,407
She just called
me a couple hours ago.

279
00:12:58,457 --> 00:13:01,715
Anyway, why would I tell
that future NASCAR mom anything ?

280
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:04,275
I hate her and the tractor
she rode in on.

281
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:08,099
What you hate is Nate moving on.

282
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:09,813
Look, I love you,

283
00:13:09,863 --> 00:13:12,502
But Nate liking Bree
doesn't make her a piranha,

284
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,773
And Serena liking carter
doesn't make him a prince.

285
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:21,702
Hey. Where you going ?

286
00:13:21,752 --> 00:13:23,373
I have tension.

287
00:13:25,427 --> 00:13:28,092
So maybe I'm crazy,
but I think Vanessa is

288
00:13:28,283 --> 00:13:29,915
trying to get me to
break up with Olivia.

289
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:31,042
Ooh. Evidence ?

290
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:33,883
No, it...
it was this tabloid magazine thing.

291
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:36,351
And then she gave me this whole
speech about how she thought

292
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:38,487
I should be with somebody I share
history with, you know ?

293
00:13:38,537 --> 00:13:39,380
mystery solved.

294
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,500
Uh, yeah. Duh.
I mean, everyone in the state

295
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,502
knows how she feels
about you.

296
00:13:42,552 --> 00:13:45,512
That's... no, come on. No, that was...
that was years ago. That can't be...

297
00:13:45,562 --> 00:13:47,231
Come on, Dan. Have you ever seen
a romantic comedy ?

298
00:13:47,281 --> 00:13:49,130
This is the scene right
before you chase after her

299
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,382
and tell her that you can't believe
how blind you were this whole time.

300
00:13:54,563 --> 00:13:56,618
You really like Olivia,
though, right ?

301
00:13:57,181 --> 00:13:58,937
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

302
00:13:58,987 --> 00:14:00,972
Then you better tell Vanessa that.

303
00:14:05,031 --> 00:14:06,792
Do you remember
that night at Amherst ?

304
00:14:06,842 --> 00:14:10,009
We just opened for Sonic Youth,
and it was pouring rain,

305
00:14:10,387 --> 00:14:11,878
and we couldn't bear
another night in the van.

306
00:14:11,928 --> 00:14:14,746
Oh, and we sprung for
a room in that quirky little inn.

307
00:14:14,796 --> 00:14:15,442
The skylark.

308
00:14:15,492 --> 00:14:17,670
- You remember.
- Of course I do. They served us wine

309
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,091
In "welcome back, Kotter" mugs.
I swiped Horshack for you.

310
00:14:21,141 --> 00:14:22,043
Yeah.

311
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,084
That was a perfect night.

312
00:14:25,413 --> 00:14:26,798
It was.

313
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,278
I know we talked about the Pierre,

314
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:32,168
But an inn like the skylark

315
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:34,084
might be a cool place
to get married in.

316
00:14:35,117 --> 00:14:36,221
No offense,

317
00:14:36,714 --> 00:14:39,620
but you've already done the fancy
wedding thing... A few times.

318
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,930
Don't you want to do
something more us ?

319
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,458
Well, yeah, that's great, Rufus.

320
00:14:45,508 --> 00:14:48,570
I'm sure that Mayor Bloomberg
would feel perfectly comfortable

321
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,370
toasting us with a Freddie "Boom-Boom"
Washington cup.

322
00:14:51,534 --> 00:14:53,800
That is so you, not us.

323
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,449
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize the Mayor was coming.

324
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:57,891
- I've never even met the man.
- Well, there are certain expectations

325
00:14:57,941 --> 00:14:59,265
that come with being Lily Bass.

326
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,673
You do understand that,
don't you ?

327
00:15:00,723 --> 00:15:03,375
Maybe I don't, because every time
we get to a good place,

328
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:05,219
I do or say something that
makes you angry.

329
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:07,485
that's because you can't compromise.

330
00:15:11,837 --> 00:15:13,003
You know what ?

331
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:15,914
Maybe we aren't ready to talk.

332
00:15:15,964 --> 00:15:17,171
Maybe we're not.

333
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:28,556
Oh, my god.

334
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,057
Dan. Oh, my god.
What are you doing here ? I can explain.

335
00:15:31,107 --> 00:15:33,282
It's okay. It's okay. You can tell me.

336
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,989
All right ? I'm your best friend.
I can handle it.

337
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,560
You're my best friend, too,
but I don't think I can.

338
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,460
You know what ? I know anyway.
I mean, I think I've known

339
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,721
deep down inside for
a couple months now.

340
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:41,946
- the way you broke up with Scott...
- Yeah, I had to.

341
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:43,848
The tabloid thing and the way you were
weirded out by me hanging out in

342
00:15:43,898 --> 00:15:46,314
the Hamptons. It's all right.
- What ? How does that have anything to do with...

343
00:15:46,364 --> 00:15:47,503
But I gotta be honest, you know.

344
00:15:48,729 --> 00:15:49,988
I really like Olivia.

345
00:15:50,038 --> 00:15:52,786
Dan, you're really off base right now.
And I mean, you know, I've always cared about you,

346
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:56,124
- always.
- Stop. Stop. I'm not in love with you, you moron.

347
00:15:56,924 --> 00:15:59,733
- Georgina's been blackmailing me.
- What ? Why ?

348
00:16:01,118 --> 00:16:03,506
Vanessa.
Vanessa, look, I'm you're best friend.

349
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:05,009
You can tell me.
You have to tell me.

350
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:06,242
What does she have on you ?

351
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:12,915
She knows that I know...

352
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:16,144
Scott...

353
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,796
is your brother.

354
00:17:03,324 --> 00:17:04,439
Rufus ?

355
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:05,684
Lily, where are you ?

356
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,560
Where are you ? I'm at the loft.

357
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:11,535
I... I came to apologize.
I don't know why I got so crazy.

358
00:17:11,585 --> 00:17:14,180
You were right.
I am never really gonna understand

359
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,547
this world I am now a part of,

360
00:17:15,864 --> 00:17:18,106
but that doesn't stop me
from loving you. It never has.

361
00:17:18,156 --> 00:17:19,104
I love you, too.

362
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:21,585
Well, we can keep asking
each other if we can do this.

363
00:17:21,635 --> 00:17:24,137
<i>We can keep planning and talking</i>

364
00:17:24,187 --> 00:17:26,776
and adjusting and talking some more,

365
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:28,188
Or we can just leap.

366
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:30,491
So let's leap. Let's get married.

367
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,516
We're already getting married,
Rufus.

368
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:34,671
I mean soon. I mean tomorrow.

369
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:37,101
We leap.

370
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,654
Oh, my God.

371
00:17:42,053 --> 00:17:42,909
Yes.

372
00:17:43,872 --> 00:17:44,929
We leap.

373
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,664
<i>Put on those Dancing shoes, kids.</i>

374
00:17:47,714 --> 00:17:49,883
<i>Looks like we're
going to the chapel.</i>

375
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:57,661
The Whitney is a no,
Harvard Club a no

376
00:17:57,711 --> 00:17:59,740
And Colicchio laughed in my face
when I asked about craft.

377
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,439
The only time I want to hear NO

378
00:18:01,489 --> 00:18:03,001
is if Ruth Madoff wants an invite.

379
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:04,710
Constance crew, what have you got ?

380
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,807
My sister's a florist.
She can handle the flowers.

381
00:18:06,857 --> 00:18:09,191
- Great.
- We've got cake. My aunt owns a bakery.

382
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:11,349
She said she found a cancellation.

383
00:18:11,502 --> 00:18:14,060
Oh, I'm sorry.
My family's in investment banking.

384
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,563
- They're all broke.
- Then you can go.

385
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:22,278
- Dorota. - I call the Sonic Youths.

386
00:18:22,328 --> 00:18:24,755
They in North Hampton,
will try to make it.

387
00:18:25,202 --> 00:18:27,921
Acceptable. Hey, Jenny, you okay ?

388
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:29,682
You've been working
on that dress all night.

389
00:18:29,835 --> 00:18:32,383
It's like my own
PROJECT RUNWAY challenge.

390
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:34,549
Wow. This is really happening.

391
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:36,235
Are you sure you don't need any help ?

392
00:18:36,285 --> 00:18:38,433
For once, don't worry about any
of the wedding details.

393
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:40,518
You work on getting married.
And write those vows.

394
00:18:40,568 --> 00:18:41,850
Oh, I just finished.

395
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,514
Then let me hear them.

396
00:18:43,972 --> 00:18:46,133
Yeah. Yeah, aunt Irene.
So I'll... I'll see you then ?

397
00:18:46,183 --> 00:18:49,800
Okay. Yeah, the socks fit perfectly.
All right. Bye.

398
00:18:49,955 --> 00:18:50,930
Don't make me do this.

399
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,067
You know it's only a matter of time
before Georgina spills.

400
00:18:53,117 --> 00:18:54,464
Yeah, that's exactly why we should
tell my dad.

401
00:18:54,514 --> 00:18:55,861
Dan, this was your idea.

402
00:18:55,911 --> 00:18:57,773
Lily and your dad are
too precarious right now.

403
00:18:57,823 --> 00:19:00,063
This is their wedding day.
You can't drop a bomb like that.

404
00:19:00,113 --> 00:19:02,399
You're gonna have to hold
Georgina off for one more day.

405
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:04,067
You can do this. Be strong.

406
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:07,385
Okay. Just, um, remind me later
to kill you, please.

407
00:19:07,782 --> 00:19:10,209
Hey, dad, listen.
So I gotta go out for a couple of hours,

408
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:12,377
But I will be back as soon as I can.

409
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:14,244
It's my wedding day.
Where are you going ?

410
00:19:14,294 --> 00:19:15,219
You don't want to know,

411
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:17,684
but it's absolutely,
absolutely important. I promise.

412
00:19:17,734 --> 00:19:19,893
And watching the sun
set over the ocean

413
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:22,730
in Santa Cruz that day,
I knew that Rufus Humphrey

414
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,460
- was meant for me.
- Mom, are you kidding me ?

415
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,454
Those could be the exact same
vows you wrote for Klaus.

416
00:19:27,504 --> 00:19:29,638
You substituted
Lederhosen for Doc Martens

417
00:19:29,688 --> 00:19:31,940
and nice for Santa Cruz.
- No, they couldn't.

418
00:19:32,332 --> 00:19:34,680
Oh, God. I'm terrible at this.

419
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,380
- What do I say ?
- This wedding isn't like your others.

420
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,580
You're marrying Rufus,
your soul mate,

421
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,246
the love of your life...

422
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:43,075
Talk about
that and your futures together,

423
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,916
- what you'll do, all that kind of stuff.
- God.

424
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:48,663
Serena, I just got off
the phone with the mayor's office.

425
00:19:48,713 --> 00:19:50,101
He's agreed to expedite permits.

426
00:19:50,151 --> 00:19:53,403
Rufus and Lily can get married
at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.

427
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:55,957
It's perfect.
Okay, what are we waiting for ?

428
00:19:56,007 --> 00:19:58,499
Amalia, new mean girls,
go to the garden and get to work.

429
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:59,955
Blair, you're on whip-cracking duty.

430
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:01,344
I'll deal with the caterers.

431
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:04,385
- Mom, just please work on those vows.
- Okay.

432
00:20:04,435 --> 00:20:05,988
I'll handle everything else.

433
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,463
Wow. I wondered what
happened to Poppy.

434
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:12,234
I had no idea it was
that easy to get someone deported.

435
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:17,866
That is... that's so thoughtful.
That's so Georgina.

436
00:20:18,015 --> 00:20:20,809
Uh, you know,
I really missed you while you were away.

437
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:22,148
You did ?

438
00:20:23,087 --> 00:20:24,872
I... I heard you
were seeing someone.

439
00:20:24,922 --> 00:20:27,302
I was. But she... it turns out
she was dating Orlando Bloom

440
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,667
- behind my back. Can you believe that ?
- No.

441
00:20:29,717 --> 00:20:32,370
- Yeah. - Huh. It is amazing

442
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,563
how down that guy's
star-o-meter has gone.

443
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:35,678
I shouldn't have been
with someone like that.

444
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:38,426
You know, there's... there's no...
there's no history there.

445
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:40,375
In fact, I was thinking

446
00:20:41,162 --> 00:20:42,876
that maybe we could hit
the reset button on us.

447
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:46,463
You know, like go on a date,
something like that.

448
00:20:48,283 --> 00:20:49,187
Really ?

449
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,979
You want me to be your date
at your dad's wedding today ?

450
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:55,084
I... I read about
it on "Gossip Girl".

451
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:57,420
Uh, y... y... you know what ?
That's kind of a...

452
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,033
it's a private event.
It's small. Uh, so tomorrow.

453
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:03,180
Oh. Yeah. Okay.
Uh, that... that works.

454
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,656
- Great.
- Yeah, okay.

455
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:17,646
What does it mean

456
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,569
when someone used to grab
your ass but now doesn't ?

457
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,512
It means that someone's
a big fat liar.

458
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:28,070
How is my favorite bridesmaid ?

459
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,335
Working my butt off, but happy.
You're coming, right ?

460
00:21:31,385 --> 00:21:33,249
I wouldn't miss you in something
pink and poofy.

461
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,500
I'm serious. I know you've been
avoiding my friends,

462
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,619
but this is my mother's wedding.
It's important.

463
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:39,556
- I know.
- You can't hide from them forever.

464
00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:41,733
- Chuck is prickly.
- I'll be there,

465
00:21:43,858 --> 00:21:45,537
And i'm not afraid of Chuck.

466
00:21:46,876 --> 00:21:49,154
I wouldn't pull out
the suit quite yet.

467
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:51,922
I've spoken to Bree Buckley.

468
00:21:52,615 --> 00:21:54,129
She told me everything.

469
00:21:55,838 --> 00:21:57,030
Did you tell her where I was ?

470
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,190
I told her there's a certain wedding
at the garden

471
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,094
that she and her family wouldn't
want to miss.

472
00:22:01,144 --> 00:22:03,846
- You're setting me up.
- No, I'm giving you a choice.

473
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,969
You can go to the wedding

474
00:22:07,538 --> 00:22:09,557
and tell Serena the ugly truth.

475
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:13,150
Even if by some chance
she can stomach you after that,

476
00:22:13,678 --> 00:22:17,344
you still have to deal with Bree,
her family...

477
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,430
and a little thing I like
to call Southern Justice.

478
00:22:24,131 --> 00:22:25,130
Or ?

479
00:22:25,306 --> 00:22:28,088
I'm getting sick of
being your travel agent.

480
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,014
This ticket's the last,

481
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:32,175
and it's one-way.

482
00:22:49,944 --> 00:22:51,458
Georgina, hey.

483
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:55,170
Wow. Uh,
so how'd everything go with Vanessa ?

484
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,651
Does she, uh,
does she even want to see me ?

485
00:22:57,979 --> 00:22:59,154
You know what ?

486
00:22:59,204 --> 00:23:01,590
We're going to go
surprise her right now.

487
00:23:03,293 --> 00:23:04,937
Let's buy you a tie.

488
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:08,318
<i>Looks like this wedding song
just became "stormy weather".</i>

489
00:23:08,623 --> 00:23:10,725
Don't worry. Here comes the sun.

490
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:19,109
The Sonic Youth's stuck in traffic.

491
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:22,796
It's okay, Dorota. But next time,
remember, Mr. Chuck has a chopper.

492
00:23:23,589 --> 00:23:24,939
Hey, have you seen Carter ?

493
00:23:24,989 --> 00:23:26,841
I haven't been able to
reach him on his cell.

494
00:23:26,891 --> 00:23:29,007
Its'still early. He'll be here.

495
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:33,199
Go. Flit. Mingle.
I'll keep an eye out. Don't worry.

496
00:23:35,383 --> 00:23:37,300
I'm so glad you invited me, Nate.

497
00:23:37,593 --> 00:23:40,106
Well, I'm just glad Blair
didn't scare you off.

498
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:43,964
Wait, are you looking for someone ?

499
00:23:44,014 --> 00:23:46,089
No, no, I'm just taking it all in.
It's...

500
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:48,844
perfect.
It's the perfect location,

501
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,253
the perfect weather.

502
00:23:50,488 --> 00:23:52,823
Eric, it's the perfect wedding.
- I know.

503
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,459
Carter is more than fashionably late,
and it better be

504
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:02,525
because he's lost his keys
or he got hit by a pedicab,

505
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:04,070
and not because of
something you did.

506
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,750
Trust me. Serena's life will
be much better without Carter,

507
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:09,640
which is why I offered
him an easy way out.

508
00:24:11,354 --> 00:24:13,462
I don't care what
Bree Buckley told you.

509
00:24:13,512 --> 00:24:14,953
Carter's a new man with Serena,

510
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:16,917
and this is her mother's wedding.
He won't miss it.

511
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:19,100
Well, we'll see who's right.
In the meantime,

512
00:24:19,246 --> 00:24:20,972
I'm going to get a canape.

513
00:24:21,806 --> 00:24:25,060
I nearly choked. She shoved her
tongue right down my throat.

514
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:27,815
I... I did some great acting, though.
Totally pulled it off.

515
00:24:27,865 --> 00:24:30,393
It'll be worth it when you see
them finally happily married.

516
00:24:30,443 --> 00:24:33,930
- You're right. You're right, right ?
- I hope so. I'll see you soon.

517
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,746
- Try not to worry.
- Yeah.

518
00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:40,050
Oh, Jenny, it's gorgeous.

519
00:24:40,477 --> 00:24:41,393
Thanks.

520
00:24:44,407 --> 00:24:47,699
You know, Lily, It wasn't easy for
me when my parents split up.

521
00:24:48,274 --> 00:24:50,680
And, uh, it was even harder

522
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,598
when I realized my dad was
in love with someone else.

523
00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:55,218
But the truth is,

524
00:24:56,052 --> 00:24:58,670
I've... I've never seen him
happier than he is with you.

525
00:25:01,021 --> 00:25:02,289
That is so sweet.

526
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:05,131
I... I can't wait for
you to hear his vows.

527
00:25:05,181 --> 00:25:07,072
They're...
they're all about your future together,

528
00:25:07,122 --> 00:25:10,348
and I don't want to spoil them,
but they're really beautiful.

529
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,355
Okay, I'm gonna go,
but you look amazing,

530
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:14,582
and I'll see you out there.
- Thank you.

531
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,928
Looks like I was right,
and you were wrong.

532
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:46,421
Hey, you okay ?

533
00:25:47,982 --> 00:25:48,910
No.

534
00:25:50,093 --> 00:25:52,993
And you might not be either when
you hear what I have to say.

535
00:25:55,994 --> 00:25:59,184
A few months before we left
to search for your dad,

536
00:25:59,234 --> 00:26:00,138
I, uh,

537
00:26:00,714 --> 00:26:03,168
I ran up some gambling debt.

538
00:26:03,485 --> 00:26:06,341
I owed a lot of money
to some scary people.

539
00:26:07,797 --> 00:26:09,887
And then I met this woman...

540
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,120
Beth.

541
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,251
She was shy, kind,

542
00:26:13,404 --> 00:26:15,770
And, well, she...
fell in love with me,

543
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,445
and I saw an opportunity.

544
00:26:19,372 --> 00:26:20,402
She had money ?

545
00:26:20,452 --> 00:26:23,897
Her family did, and I knew they'd
take care of my debts

546
00:26:23,947 --> 00:26:27,355
if... it looked like I was
about to be one of them,

547
00:26:28,682 --> 00:26:29,973
I proposed.

548
00:26:30,396 --> 00:26:34,204
The wedding was all planned,
and she had her dress, flowers.

549
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:35,426
And I...

550
00:26:36,377 --> 00:26:38,572
nearly went through with it,
but I...

551
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,058
- I didn't love her.
- So what, you... you just disappeared ?

552
00:26:44,108 --> 00:26:45,490
It's the worst thing I've ever done.

553
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,832
You buy this girl a ring.
You tell her you love her.

554
00:26:47,882 --> 00:26:49,031
What... what, did you make her

555
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:50,580
breakfast in the morning, too ?
- Serena, it's...

556
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,946
it's not the same.
- Carter, I have to go.

557
00:26:52,996 --> 00:26:55,064
My mother's getting
married right now.

558
00:27:05,181 --> 00:27:07,024
I've been looking all over for you.

559
00:27:07,423 --> 00:27:09,004
Geor... Georgina, hey.

560
00:27:09,054 --> 00:27:10,839
What a... what a great surprise.

561
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:13,093
Uh, I thought our date was tomorrow.

562
00:27:14,056 --> 00:27:15,698
It is. I just stopped by

563
00:27:15,748 --> 00:27:17,905
to give Lily and Rufus
a wedding present.

564
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,582
Hey. What was that about ?

565
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:27,737
You look beautiful, Lil. Come on.

566
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:31,588
Can we just talk for a second ?

567
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,815
I don't get it. E... e...
everything came together for today.

568
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,832
I'm sorry. I can't write my vows.

569
00:27:41,882 --> 00:27:43,544
I mean,
how could I when we don't agree

570
00:27:43,594 --> 00:27:46,045
on how to raise our children
or how to get married

571
00:27:46,095 --> 00:27:48,581
- or anything ?
- What happened to taking a leap ?

572
00:27:49,016 --> 00:27:51,176
But the stakes are too high.

573
00:27:55,988 --> 00:27:57,878
<i>Ah, The Wedding March.</i>

574
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:01,730
<i>Here comes the awkward pause.</i>

575
00:28:04,603 --> 00:28:06,717
Uh, uh, I'm sorry, everyone.

576
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:09,018
There's been a slight delay.
Uh...

577
00:28:12,933 --> 00:28:15,199
I'm sure there's just a tear
in her hem or something.

578
00:28:15,249 --> 00:28:17,195
I'll... I'll check.

579
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:22,025
<i>Looks like the wedding dress
might have a runaway train.</i>

580
00:28:25,588 --> 00:28:27,714
I... I can't believe you.
You want to know

581
00:28:27,764 --> 00:28:30,097
what our future looks like, Lily ?
It looks like this.

582
00:28:30,147 --> 00:28:32,406
We are going to fight.
We're... we're gonna want

583
00:28:32,456 --> 00:28:34,370
to kill each other sometimes.
That's what marriage is about...

584
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,380
not running away from
every little problem...

585
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,529
sticking it out,
you know, committing.

586
00:28:39,057 --> 00:28:40,869
Do you think you
can do that or not ?

587
00:28:42,173 --> 00:28:46,286
I, uh... I don't think I can.

588
00:28:46,336 --> 00:28:49,160
Wait. So you're not
getting married ?

589
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,757
- Scott ?
- What ? Who are you ?

590
00:28:50,807 --> 00:28:53,552
This is a private conversation
at a private event.

591
00:28:53,602 --> 00:28:54,679
How dare you.

592
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:03,070
- What, do you know him ?
- Oh, uh, uh, yeah, that was...

593
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,320
Your love child. Yeah, not dead.

594
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,295
Congratulations. It's a boy.

595
00:29:10,517 --> 00:29:12,513
<i>Ooh, ooh, love child.</i>

596
00:29:12,701 --> 00:29:14,571
<i>Things didn't get any easier.</i>

597
00:29:14,724 --> 00:29:16,543
<i>Might have to move
the honeymoon suite</i>

598
00:29:16,593 --> 00:29:18,187
<i>to the heartbreak hotel.</i>

599
00:29:19,168 --> 00:29:21,009
Wait. Wait.
What was she talking about ?

600
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,890
Don't believe her.
Georgina is a liar.

601
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,835
- What is she even doing here ?
- Our son is dead, isn't he ? Isn't he ?

602
00:29:26,885 --> 00:29:29,059
Yeah, of course he is. That was, uh,
Scott Rosson, Andrew's brother.

603
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:30,990
- You know Andrew's brother ?
- Or that's at least what he told me.

604
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,534
Dad, dad, dad. Lily... Um...

605
00:29:34,885 --> 00:29:38,375
Scott, um, Scott is your son.

606
00:29:40,308 --> 00:29:42,164
I'm so sorry.
I was gonna tell you after the wedding.

607
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:43,913
I... I found out just yesterday.

608
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:46,609
Scott is...

609
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:51,151
How is that possible ?

610
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:54,016
The Rossons lied to you.
Andrew wasn't your son.

611
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,399
Scott is.
He wasn't ready to tell you.

612
00:29:57,892 --> 00:29:59,959
I have to go find him.
Vanessa, where do you think he went ?

613
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:02,420
He's probably headed back to Boston.
He takes the Chinatown bus.

614
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,708
I'm going to find him.

615
00:30:04,758 --> 00:30:07,538
Well, I'm coming with you.
He's our son. We're doing this together.

616
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:11,739
I'm so sorry.

617
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,604
Are you ok ?

618
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,049
Will you just leave ?

619
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:37,219
Please. I... I need some time.

620
00:30:44,616 --> 00:30:47,370
Just so you know,
I told you what I told you,

621
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,470
because it's not the same with you.

622
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,660
I really do care about you, Serena,

623
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,045
so much.

624
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,131
Hey, Carter.

625
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:12,855
You remember my cousin
Beth's brothers, right ?

626
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,016
Played defensive line
for Arnett Mead ?

627
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:17,476
I'll be at the downing tonight.

628
00:31:18,662 --> 00:31:20,118
We can't do this here.

629
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:22,807
They'll be watching you.

630
00:31:33,148 --> 00:31:36,213
What ? It's not like somebody
else is gonna eat this now.

631
00:31:39,218 --> 00:31:41,947
Mmm. Hey, guys. Great wedding, huh ?

632
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:50,001
Look, Rufus,
we just drove around the entire block.

633
00:31:50,051 --> 00:31:51,928
He's not here. Vanessa was wrong.

634
00:31:51,978 --> 00:31:54,312
The bus for boston
leaves in eight minutes.

635
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:56,895
So he could still come.
You know, he could be anywhere.

636
00:31:56,945 --> 00:31:58,926
- Let's go back to the bus stop.
- But, uh...

637
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,893
- What are you doing ? Let's go.
- But what's the point ?

638
00:32:00,943 --> 00:32:02,854
The point is we can still find him.

639
00:32:03,237 --> 00:32:06,550
Well, and if we do, after what...
after what I just did,

640
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,655
I... what am I supposed to say to him ?

641
00:32:08,705 --> 00:32:10,450
That we're his parents and
that we're here for him

642
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,799
- And that love can fix things.
- Oh, we both know that's not true.

643
00:32:14,469 --> 00:32:16,970
You know what ? I don't.

644
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,606
You... what Scott saw

645
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:23,699
was you grasping at anything
you can to push me away.

646
00:32:23,749 --> 00:32:24,755
That is not true.

647
00:32:24,805 --> 00:32:26,867
First it was Serena and Brown,
then the mugs and the mayor,

648
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:28,135
Then it's that you can't see the future.

649
00:32:28,185 --> 00:32:30,800
Well, I'm scared of the future.
I'm scared of a lot of things.

650
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,221
You're scared because
you're in love with me

651
00:32:32,271 --> 00:32:33,930
like you've never loved
any of your husbands.

652
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,510
And unlike a Bart Bass,
someone like me can break your heart,

653
00:32:36,724 --> 00:32:38,210
and that's terrifying.

654
00:32:38,944 --> 00:32:41,976
And I know that,
because right now you're breaking mine.

655
00:33:01,451 --> 00:33:02,461
Scott ?

656
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:04,058
Scott.

657
00:33:06,641 --> 00:33:07,538
Scott.

658
00:33:07,714 --> 00:33:10,268
- S... stop. This was a mistake.
- Don't say that.

659
00:33:10,432 --> 00:33:13,444
All my life,
I wondered about my real parents.

660
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:15,828
When I found out
that they were you and Lily,

661
00:33:16,051 --> 00:33:18,134
that you were back together
and you were getting married,

662
00:33:18,184 --> 00:33:20,775
I guess I hoped that I'd find out
that you gave me up.

663
00:33:20,825 --> 00:33:22,140
Cause you weren't ready,

664
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:26,610
not cause you didn't
love each other.

665
00:33:26,892 --> 00:33:28,709
Look, the difference is now
I know we both want you,

666
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:31,163
need you in our lives.
Sure we got our problems,

667
00:33:31,213 --> 00:33:32,612
But lily and I love our children,

668
00:33:32,662 --> 00:33:35,138
and despite what you just saw,
we love each other.

669
00:33:35,336 --> 00:33:38,574
He's right. He's the best father.

670
00:33:38,624 --> 00:33:40,348
And the best man I've ever known.

671
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:42,650
Uh, I am scared,

672
00:33:43,503 --> 00:33:47,055
because marrying you. Means finally
giving myself a real partner,

673
00:33:47,105 --> 00:33:49,263
my children a real father,

674
00:33:49,313 --> 00:33:50,232
and...

675
00:33:51,665 --> 00:33:54,847
finally...
letting myself truly love.

676
00:33:57,031 --> 00:33:58,017
Lily.

677
00:33:58,463 --> 00:33:59,825
I'm sorry, Rufus.

678
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,639
And I'm sorry, Scott...

679
00:34:03,815 --> 00:34:06,330
That this is how you had to meet me,

680
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:09,993
Because all I thought about
for the last 20 years is...

681
00:34:11,555 --> 00:34:14,467
holding our child in my arms.

682
00:34:16,048 --> 00:34:17,833
Please give us a chance.

683
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:44,205
<i>Spotted...
a family reunited, and it feels so good.</i>

684
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:47,903
And I promise to eat caviar

685
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:50,040
without spitting it in my napkin

686
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,435
when we go to dinner
at Mayor Bloomberg's,

687
00:34:52,485 --> 00:34:55,711
as long as he knows when he comes
to our house, he's eating my chili.

688
00:34:56,568 --> 00:34:59,362
- Lily.
- And, Rufus, um,

689
00:35:00,936 --> 00:35:02,955
I know that our future

690
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,364
Will be just like us...

691
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,391
flawed and fragmented

692
00:35:10,023 --> 00:35:11,322
and full of more love

693
00:35:11,372 --> 00:35:13,952
than I ever thought possible.

694
00:35:15,185 --> 00:35:17,853
I am so excited for
you to be my husband...

695
00:35:24,018 --> 00:35:25,826
and for our children,

696
00:35:26,753 --> 00:35:28,080
all of them...

697
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:31,782
to be my family.

698
00:35:32,357 --> 00:35:35,560
Well, by the power vested in me

699
00:35:36,044 --> 00:35:38,052
by a sketchy service
on the internet...

700
00:35:39,543 --> 00:35:42,116
I pronounce you husband and wife.

701
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:43,607
Oh.

702
00:35:44,405 --> 00:35:45,309
Whoo !

703
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:46,953
Whoo ! Ow !

704
00:35:49,418 --> 00:35:50,346
Yay !

705
00:35:52,436 --> 00:35:54,279
Okay, we get it. Enough.

706
00:35:55,434 --> 00:35:57,019
Yay !

707
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:00,823
Ohh.

708
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,327
Congratulations.
I'm so happy for you.

709
00:36:04,377 --> 00:36:06,793
Thank you. Where is carter ?

710
00:36:06,969 --> 00:36:09,575
Oh, he... he went home.
He wasn't feeling well.

711
00:36:10,386 --> 00:36:13,016
You know all I want is for
you to be happy, right ?

712
00:36:14,112 --> 00:36:16,519
Look, I have to admit,
if you were at Brown,

713
00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:19,642
this wedding probably
never would have happened,

714
00:36:20,382 --> 00:36:21,590
so thank you.

715
00:36:21,768 --> 00:36:22,789
Of course.

716
00:36:23,529 --> 00:36:26,574
And I really am so happy you
finally found the right man.

717
00:36:26,879 --> 00:36:28,581
Mm. You're very lucky.

718
00:36:30,237 --> 00:36:31,270
Aw.

719
00:36:34,011 --> 00:36:35,068
I love you.

720
00:36:35,221 --> 00:36:36,219
I love you.

721
00:36:38,556 --> 00:36:40,540
Sorry for not telling you who I was.

722
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,630
You know what ?
I should have guessed.

723
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,137
No one under 40 has ever shown
that much interest in Lincoln Hawk.

724
00:36:45,325 --> 00:36:47,259
See, I told you. He has my nose.

725
00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:49,841
Uh, maybe, but those are my eyebrows.

726
00:36:50,396 --> 00:36:52,599
So, Scott, what do you think
about board games ?

727
00:36:52,649 --> 00:36:54,811
- Love them.
- Fantastic.

728
00:36:57,405 --> 00:36:58,838
So hey, uh, Vanessa texted.

729
00:36:58,888 --> 00:37:01,444
She said she's sorry she couldn't make
it back here.

730
00:37:01,494 --> 00:37:02,466
I just...

731
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:04,810
I just wish I didn't put her
in the middle of all this.

732
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,773
Vanessa is an all's well
that ends well kind of girl.

733
00:37:06,823 --> 00:37:09,460
She'll be fine.
You thinking about sticking around ?

734
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,598
Nah, I have to go back to Boston,

735
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:13,310
my family, figure my life out.

736
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,116
Lily said there's
an open invitation.

737
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,970
I'll definitely take her up on that.
Maybe the holidays.

738
00:37:18,122 --> 00:37:20,499
I'd love it.
I'm sure Vanessa would, too.

739
00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:23,552
Come here.

740
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:44,853
Hey.

741
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:47,310
I've been looking for you.
You okay ?

742
00:37:48,493 --> 00:37:49,694
Not really.

743
00:37:52,265 --> 00:37:54,061
Carter told me some stuff,

744
00:37:54,296 --> 00:37:56,045
And it turns out,

745
00:37:56,095 --> 00:37:58,405
he's not the person
I thought he was.

746
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,180
The person he is...

747
00:38:01,018 --> 00:38:02,768
I... I...
I don't really want to know.

748
00:38:03,578 --> 00:38:04,594
Look...

749
00:38:05,864 --> 00:38:08,165
I may loathe the guy,

750
00:38:10,408 --> 00:38:12,386
But he didn't have to
own up to anything.

751
00:38:12,726 --> 00:38:14,124
He could have skipped town.

752
00:38:14,174 --> 00:38:15,838
I even bought him a ticket.

753
00:38:16,084 --> 00:38:18,350
He risked to not
going to the wedding,

754
00:38:18,511 --> 00:38:20,319
knowing bree would be there.

755
00:38:20,847 --> 00:38:23,310
What, the girl he was
engaged to was a Buckley ?

756
00:38:23,794 --> 00:38:25,350
He must really care about you.

757
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:28,958
Do you think the Buckleys
would actually hurt him ?

758
00:38:29,135 --> 00:38:30,990
They clearly want revenge.

759
00:38:42,366 --> 00:38:43,692
I talked to Blair.

760
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:45,289
So is it true ?

761
00:38:45,442 --> 00:38:47,356
You used me to get to Carter ?

762
00:38:48,325 --> 00:38:49,347
Yeah...

763
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:52,165
I guess I did.

764
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,417
Come on, Nate.

765
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,543
You're a Van Der Bilt.

766
00:38:57,754 --> 00:38:58,928
I'm a Buckley.

767
00:39:00,317 --> 00:39:02,489
And as much as I like you,

768
00:39:04,544 --> 00:39:06,305
That's always gonna come first.

769
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:07,796
It's in my blood.

770
00:39:08,536 --> 00:39:09,675
It's Texas.

771
00:39:10,312 --> 00:39:12,120
If it means anything,

772
00:39:13,377 --> 00:39:14,563
I'm sorry.
- No.

773
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,956
No. You know what ?
It doesn't...

774
00:39:20,421 --> 00:39:21,889
So please leave.

775
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,394
Carter, hey.

776
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:42,671
I just talked to chuck.

777
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,996
I just want to make
sure you're okay.

778
00:39:45,046 --> 00:39:46,424
Call me, please.

779
00:39:47,163 --> 00:39:48,654
I want to talk to you.

780
00:40:03,922 --> 00:40:07,562
Well, it took 20 years,
but we finally made it.

781
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,344
Well, I wouldn't have
done it any other way.

782
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,106
This would be a perfect night

783
00:40:13,156 --> 00:40:15,610
except for the fact
that Georgina got away unscathed.

784
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,334
- I wouldn't be too certain about that.
- Hi !

785
00:40:22,122 --> 00:40:23,132
Mm.

786
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,393
I couldn't help but notice you.

787
00:40:32,342 --> 00:40:35,113
I am Prince Alexi from Belarus.

788
00:40:35,971 --> 00:40:37,814
Nice to meet you, prince.

789
00:40:38,448 --> 00:40:40,834
I am flying back to
my home country right now

790
00:40:40,884 --> 00:40:43,101
to celebrate my new oil pipeline.

791
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,191
Any chance you want to join ?

792
00:40:46,623 --> 00:40:48,676
You know,
I'm pretty much over college,

793
00:40:48,726 --> 00:40:51,764
And, uh, well,
who am I to say no to a prince ?

794
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:52,923
Wonderful.

795
00:41:04,515 --> 00:41:07,468
<i>There are songs
that make us want to dance,</i>

796
00:41:08,754 --> 00:41:11,232
<i>Songs that make us
want to sing along,</i>

797
00:41:11,691 --> 00:41:14,673
<i>But the best songs are
the ones that bring you back</i>

798
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:17,080
<i>To the moment you first heard them</i>

799
00:41:18,842 --> 00:41:22,999
<i>And once again break your heart.</i>

800
00:41:23,903 --> 00:41:26,718
