(missing persons)
?you ask yourself ?
?where do we go from here?

7
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:23,721
?life is so strange ?
?destination unknown ?

8
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,656
?when you don't know ?

00:00:25,724 --> 00:00:27,725
?your destination ?

(woman) rhodes records.
rick rhodes' office.

12
00:00:32,464 --> 00:00:34,899
Hi. is he in?

13
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:36,234
It's lily.

14
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:37,768
Who?

15
00:00:37,836 --> 00:00:39,103
His daughter?

16
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:41,105
Oh. ahem.
one moment, please.

17
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:43,107
Thank you.
thank you very much.

18
00:00:43,175 --> 00:00:44,875
(click)

19
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,577
(man) hey, lil.
long time, babe.

20
00:00:46,645 --> 00:00:49,580
Hi, dad. i know,
um, which is why i was hoping

21
00:00:49,648 --> 00:00:52,016
That we could, like,
catch up or something.

22
00:00:52,084 --> 00:00:54,518
There's so much
to talk about.

23
00:00:54,586 --> 00:00:57,521
Is there any way
that you can, uh, have lunch?

24
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:00,124
You're in l.a.? why aren't you
in santa barbara?

25
00:01:00,192 --> 00:01:03,861
In school?
well, we can make it a dinner
if that's better for you.

26
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:07,531
I'm leaving for london.
but, lil, what's going on?
geoffrey's?
your regular table?

27
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:09,700
Great. okay, see you then.
love you.

28
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:11,502
(horn honks)

29
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:22,646
(man) mrs. bass?

30
00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:23,781
We're here.

31
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:25,916
Oh, yes. thank you.

32
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:28,519
Serena's been in jail
for over four hours.

33
00:01:28,587 --> 00:01:30,121
She's already served more time

34
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:32,123
Than nicole richie
and lindsay lohan combined.

35
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:34,425
She's a socialite mistakenly
accused of stealing a bracelet.

36
00:01:34,493 --> 00:01:37,428
I doubt they're working her over
with the phone book.

37
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:40,431
When i called lily,
she said she was on her way.

38
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:43,434
Where is she?
i just can't believe she had
her own daughter arrested.

39
00:01:43,502 --> 00:01:47,171
I mean, who does that?
someone
who's never been arrested.

40
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,672
Hello. i'm lilian bass.

41
00:01:48,773 --> 00:01:51,476
I'm here for my daughter,
serena van der woodsen.

42
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,319
So was lily blown away?
well, not really.

43
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:05,023
Yeah, he never actually, uh...
proposed. minor detail
in a proposal.

44
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,992
Kinda the key ingredient
to the recipe.
so he came home
and went into his room.

45
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,895
Uh, we haven't
seen him since.
ahem. hey, dad.

46
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:12,696
Oh, so prom tomorrow night--

47
00:02:12,764 --> 00:02:15,900
What do you say? we stay in,
watch some scary movies?
the scarier the better.

48
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:18,236
Absolutely.
you guys are
the "gossip girl" generation.

49
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:21,039
Don't expect me to believe
you're not interested

50
00:02:21,106 --> 00:02:23,741
In this gossip.
uh, nope. only interested
in my nim chow.

51
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:29,180
So to add to the lily intrigue--
or possibly help explain it--

52
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,315
I got a weird call
about your investment.

53
00:02:31,383 --> 00:02:35,253
The money's gone. it's over.
really? 'cause, uh, serena had
a plan to get it all back.

54
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,755
It's--
no, lily had
a plan of her own.

55
00:02:37,822 --> 00:02:40,758
Well,
that's what i was hoping.
yeah,
she had serena arrested.

56
00:02:40,825 --> 00:02:42,460
What?
w-why?

57
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:45,263
I suggest you kids
stay out of it.

58
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,899
Let these van der woodsen women
fight it out themselves.

59
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:51,602
Wow.

60
00:03:10,822 --> 00:03:13,224
(camera shutter snaps)

61
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:14,959
(jail door slams)

62
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:16,927
(sighs)

63
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,000
You forced me to do this. i just
hope you learned your lesson.

64
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:25,002
That my mom's crazier
than i ever imagined?

65
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,004
Well, no crazier than you,
my daughter,

66
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:30,007
Thinking you could fix
this situation yourself.
i was fixing this,

67
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:33,010
But then you were too worried
what people would think.
when you're a mother,

68
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:35,012
You will understand
that you have to make decisions

69
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,615
That don't always win you
points for popularity.

70
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:40,318
When i'm a mother,
i will be nothing like you.

71
00:03:40,385 --> 00:03:43,754
Yes, you say that now,
but just wait.

72
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:45,756
I would rather give my kids
up for adoption

73
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:48,526
Than end up like you.

74
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:51,028
Oh, wait. you did that.

75
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:57,201
I came down here

76
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:00,371
To drop the charges
and put this behind us.

77
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:03,207
Please show a little respect,
and i will stick with my plan.

78
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:05,143
I'll just stick to mine.

79
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,379
If you didn't notice,
you weren't my phone call.
oh, so who was?

80
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:10,381
She called me, darling.

81
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:12,183
Ironic, isn't it?

82
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,984
If only she knew.

83
00:04:14,052 --> 00:04:15,486
(serena) hey, grandma.

84
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:17,721
<i>for those who complain about
the youth of today,</i>

85
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:19,757
<i>if you think we're bad,</i>

86
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:21,859
<i>you should've seen
our parents.</i>

87
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:24,028
(camera shutter snaps)

88
00:04:27,078 --> 00:04:30,013
I don't care how much
ahmet wants to give him.

89
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:31,515
The guy can't sing.

90
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,951
I'll pay for his publishing.
good-bye.

91
00:04:34,018 --> 00:04:36,520
Hey, beautiful.
you get lost?

92
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:38,922
I'm sorry i'm late.
i couldn't find parking.

93
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,093
That's what the valet's for.
right, but it also costs $2,
and i just spent that on gas.

94
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:45,363
Here to hit dad up
for some cash?
what?

95
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,930
(laughs)
no.

96
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:51,134
So, um, christmas was weird
without you.

97
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:53,871
You know how important
the fourth quarter is to retail.

98
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:57,007
Somebody's gotta keep
tower records in business.

99
00:04:58,643 --> 00:05:00,811
But i was sorry
i couldn't be there.

100
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,880
Yeah... um, about that...

101
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:05,115
I'm not a headshrinker
or anything,

102
00:05:05,183 --> 00:05:07,117
But i do think
the sudden uprooting

103
00:05:07,185 --> 00:05:09,119
Of my family from new york,

104
00:05:09,187 --> 00:05:11,121
Coupled with my parents'
tumultuous divorce

105
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:13,557
May have contributed
to some recent difficulties

106
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,460
That i might be having.
you got kicked out
of boarding school.

107
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:19,797
<i>what? wait, wait.
how did you know that?
she told me.</i>

108
00:05:19,865 --> 00:05:21,732
Mom.

109
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,367
Hello, lily.
what are you doing here?

110
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:25,369
If it was up to your father,

111
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:27,371
They'd stop me
at the county line,

112
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,641
But santa barbara's really
only a prison in my mind,
good to see you, cece.

113
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:33,844
<i>wish i could say the same,
richard.
you hung up the phone with me,
and you called her?</i>

114
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:35,979
You didn't even give me
a chance to explain.

115
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:37,981
That's because
he would have to parent,

116
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:40,751
And we know he always leaves
"bad cop" to me.

117
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:43,186
Punishing loved ones just comes
so much more naturally

118
00:05:43,254 --> 00:05:46,891
To some people.
excuse me. may i have
a gin and tonic? no tonic.

119
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,727
I come with some good news.

120
00:05:49,795 --> 00:05:51,729
You're letting me
live with dad? no way.

121
00:05:51,797 --> 00:05:54,899
That's exactly what i was gonna
say. my bags are in the car.

122
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:57,835
And can i have the room that
overlooks the tennis courts?

123
00:05:57,903 --> 00:06:01,439
I love that room. thank you for
coming all the way down here,

124
00:06:01,506 --> 00:06:04,708
Mom, but i think this is
all worked out, right?
richard?

125
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:08,078
Lily, that sounds so good.
it's just--

126
00:06:08,146 --> 00:06:10,848
Actually, your father did make
a call to the school.

127
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,417
I told 'em what had been
happening at home,

128
00:06:13,485 --> 00:06:16,520
About your sister taking off,
your mother and i splitting up.

129
00:06:16,588 --> 00:06:18,188
I explained that it was

130
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:20,925
An isolated, uncharacteristic
act of rebellion.

131
00:06:20,992 --> 00:06:23,561
They're willing to turn your
expulsion into a suspension.
what?

132
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:26,931
<i>you can be back on monday.
but i wanted to get expelled.</i>

133
00:06:26,998 --> 00:06:29,299
Lily, whatever for?
that school has everything.

134
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:31,936
Everything except for dad.

135
00:06:32,003 --> 00:06:35,038
You're living
this amazing new life here,

136
00:06:35,106 --> 00:06:38,943
And i'm just scared that
by the time i graduate,

137
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,079
I won't be
a part of it anymore.

138
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:45,282
And what if you forget
about me?

139
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:49,019
Lil, you do not have
to ever worry about that.

140
00:06:53,057 --> 00:06:56,159
I just have a lot going on
right now with work.

141
00:06:56,227 --> 00:06:58,929
I can't give you the time,
the--the supervision

142
00:06:58,997 --> 00:07:00,163
That you need.
just like clockwork.

143
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:02,299
Okay.

144
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:07,404
Dad.

145
00:07:08,773 --> 00:07:11,609
I'm late. i've gotta pack,
get to the airport.

146
00:07:11,676 --> 00:07:15,112
Put lunch on my account.
i'll talk to you soon.
dad, no.

147
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:19,683
Why do you always
have to do that?

148
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:20,718
Dad.

149
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:22,686
(sighs) thank you.

150
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:24,187
Please don't walk away.

151
00:07:24,255 --> 00:07:26,189
You need to be
with your mother, lil,

152
00:07:26,257 --> 00:07:28,191
Out of the city, in school.

153
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,193
We can't let you turn out
like your sister.

154
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:33,196
Carol? yeah, i think we can
all agree on that front.

155
00:07:33,264 --> 00:07:35,633
She ran away from our family,
and for what?

156
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,802
To become an actress, which is
a completely unrealistic goal.

157
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,804
I mean, yeah, she was
pretty good as abigail

158
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:43,641
In "the crucible," but what was
that, like, 11th grade?

159
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,809
Anyway, the point is--
is i'm not carol.

160
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:47,878
I don't crave adventure
or the freedom

161
00:07:47,946 --> 00:07:50,648
To walk my own path.
i'm perfectly comfortable

162
00:07:50,715 --> 00:07:54,985
With the path that you guys
have laid out for me.
go home, lil.

163
00:07:55,053 --> 00:07:57,721
(kisses)
dad, you have a giant house.
i won't be any trouble.

164
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:00,724
I'll call you
when i get back from london.

165
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:02,225
I'm sorry.

166
00:08:02,293 --> 00:08:04,161
I love you.

167
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:11,234
Lily, it's over.

168
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:13,170
Let's go home.

169
00:08:17,842 --> 00:08:19,777
I'll follow you back.

170
00:08:24,282 --> 00:08:27,851
See you at home.

171
00:08:45,737 --> 00:08:47,404
(engine revs)

172
00:08:49,674 --> 00:08:51,942
(elevator bell dings)

173
00:08:54,412 --> 00:08:57,414
<i>eric and i had
the most invigorating walk</i>

174
00:08:57,482 --> 00:09:00,918
From the hotel.
you know, grandma is
deceptively quick.

175
00:09:00,986 --> 00:09:03,420
Oh, she's probably racing back
to that bottle of gin

176
00:09:03,488 --> 00:09:06,423
She has hidden under the sink
in the bathroom.
zing.

177
00:09:06,491 --> 00:09:09,426
Good morning to you as well.
what are you doing here,
mother?

178
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:12,195
I don't remember inviting you
as our guest.

179
00:09:12,263 --> 00:09:14,932
I know i haven't called you,
and i'm positive you haven't

180
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,967
So much as received
a christmas card

181
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:19,970
Or fruitcake at the holiday.
well, you can be thankful
for the last one.

182
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:22,640
What have i done to earn
your ire, my dear?
well, let me think
for a second.

183
00:09:22,707 --> 00:09:25,109
Maybe telling rufus
about our child?

184
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:27,645
I'm sorry
if i thought it appropriate

185
00:09:27,712 --> 00:09:29,647
That rufus learns he has a son.

186
00:09:29,714 --> 00:09:33,483
Uh, you mean "had."

187
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:35,085
He died.

188
00:09:35,153 --> 00:09:37,755
Oh.

189
00:09:37,822 --> 00:09:39,389
I had no idea.

190
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:42,459
Imagine, something you don't
know. now if you'll excuse me,

191
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:45,929
I'm going to take serena
breakfast in bed

192
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:50,000
<i>so i can start the healing
with my daughter.
uh, you might want
to put a hold on the healing.</i>

193
00:09:50,068 --> 00:09:53,336
Serena's not in her room.
what? i thought she was coming
home with you. where is she?

194
00:09:53,404 --> 00:09:55,405
Why are you still in jail?

195
00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:57,641
(serena) it's my choice.

196
00:09:57,709 --> 00:09:59,810
Oh, god. you're not
gonna come out of there

197
00:09:59,878 --> 00:10:02,713
With a mullet and a girlfriend,
are you?
my mother didn't think
that i was old enough

198
00:10:02,781 --> 00:10:05,615
To make my own decisions,
so i decided to stay in jail,

199
00:10:05,684 --> 00:10:07,417
And i'm not leaving

200
00:10:07,485 --> 00:10:10,087
Until she agrees to let me
live my own life.
so it's a war of attrition.

201
00:10:10,155 --> 00:10:11,755
(exhales deeply)
so to speak.

202
00:10:11,823 --> 00:10:14,692
Except she gets to wage the war
from the comfort

203
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:18,228
Of her penthouse
while you remain behind bars.
look, don't worry about me.
enjoy prom with nate,

204
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:19,730
Like you always planned

205
00:10:19,798 --> 00:10:22,499
In that scrapbook
that you kept under your bed.

206
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:24,601
(scoffs) please.
i don't remember that.

207
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:26,203
I was a child then.

208
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,339
I should go. i don't want
to abuse my phone privileges.

209
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:31,875
The fact that you're
on an actual pay phone

210
00:10:31,943 --> 00:10:33,510
Has me beyond nauseous.

211
00:10:33,578 --> 00:10:35,012
Stay strong, s.

212
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,881
What's this for?
strength. you will need.

213
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:41,618
I have good news and bad news.
which do you want?

214
00:10:41,686 --> 00:10:43,187
Good news first, always.

215
00:10:43,254 --> 00:10:46,489
There is replacement.
what are you talking about?

216
00:10:46,557 --> 00:10:48,558
It makes more sense
if you pick bad news first.

217
00:10:48,626 --> 00:10:50,160
Your dress for prom.

218
00:10:50,228 --> 00:10:52,462
The dry cleaners--
they ruined it.

219
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,199
This body bag.
corpse not pretty.

220
00:10:58,069 --> 00:11:00,470
But there's a replacement.
back to good news.

221
00:11:00,538 --> 00:11:02,806
This morning it arrived
from paris.

222
00:11:02,874 --> 00:11:05,375
Just like in scrapbook.

223
00:11:05,443 --> 00:11:07,077
(laughs and gasps)

224
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:09,546
Oh! it is.

225
00:11:09,614 --> 00:11:12,582
Oh! just like my scrapbook
i don't remember keeping

226
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,886
And haven't looked at
since i was an early adolescent.

227
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:18,388
Oh, i-it must be from daddy.

228
00:11:18,456 --> 00:11:20,690
Tonight is
going to be magical.

229
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,592
(laughs)

230
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,694
You know, prom hasn't exactly
been going as planned.

231
00:11:24,763 --> 00:11:26,696
The florists lost
blair's corsage.

232
00:11:26,765 --> 00:11:28,799
Someone bought up
all the peonies,

233
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:31,135
And when i called
to confirm my limo,

234
00:11:31,202 --> 00:11:34,504
It had been rented out by
a bachelorette party in jersey.
(inhales sharply)
the heart quickens.

235
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:37,507
Yeah, well, my hotel room
was mysteriously canceled,

236
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:41,111
And now i just found out
blair's dress has been ruined.
how tragic.

237
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:43,413
I gotta ask...

238
00:11:45,016 --> 00:11:49,486
<i>am i sabotaging
your dream prom?</i>

239
00:11:49,553 --> 00:11:51,688
The answer is no,
nathaniel.

240
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:54,191
And i don't know
how many times

241
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:56,894
We need to have
this conversation.

242
00:11:56,961 --> 00:11:58,796
Blair is yours.

243
00:11:58,863 --> 00:12:00,563
Okay.

244
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:04,234
Oh, what a restorative nap
that was.

245
00:12:04,302 --> 00:12:06,236
I feel so much better.

246
00:12:06,304 --> 00:12:09,239
Well, i'm afraid that moment
is not going to last.

247
00:12:09,307 --> 00:12:12,575
Eric out of earshot?
i sent him to a movie
with jonathan.

248
00:12:12,643 --> 00:12:16,446
So no one can hear me scream.
you're gonna what, lily,

249
00:12:16,514 --> 00:12:20,017
Hack me to pieces,
suffocate me with a pillow?
i am simply--
and for the last time--

250
00:12:20,084 --> 00:12:23,086
Gonna ask you to leave my home
and never come back.

251
00:12:23,154 --> 00:12:26,323
"never" is a, uh,
very long time, darling.

252
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,925
You are toxic.

253
00:12:27,992 --> 00:12:31,862
I'm your mother.
and a memorable one at that,
so much so it seems

254
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,965
That try as i might,
i can't help turning into you.
well, maybe that's 'cause

255
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:38,035
You finally are starting
to see the wisdom of my ways.

256
00:12:38,102 --> 00:12:41,671
You blame me for everything.
and you accept responsibility
for nothing.

257
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:43,673
You know,
maybe carol's right.

258
00:12:43,741 --> 00:12:46,710
The only way to have a normal
life is without you in it.
your sister was rebellious

259
00:12:46,777 --> 00:12:49,612
And ungrateful for my love,
and look where she ended up.

260
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,049
From where i'm sitting,
it doesn't look so bad.

261
00:12:52,116 --> 00:12:54,051
I don't want you meddling

262
00:12:54,118 --> 00:12:56,553
With my family
or with my love life anymore.

263
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:01,124
I want you out. now.

264
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:15,910
Hi. i'm looking for
my sister carol. carol rhodes.

265
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:18,913
Uh, i think that
she works here. is she in?

266
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:21,916
I'm covering four extra tables
today, so that'd be no.

267
00:13:21,984 --> 00:13:23,918
Flaking on work--
that seems like carol.

268
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:26,187
Do you know
where she might be?
(dishes clatter)

269
00:13:26,255 --> 00:13:29,124
Hey! watch
where you're going, spaz.

270
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:31,126
You almost got udon
all over my gucci.

271
00:13:31,193 --> 00:13:33,928
Personally, i don't see it.

272
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:35,363
See what?

273
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,499
The family resemblance.
to carol?
wait. you know her?

274
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,135
Yeah.

275
00:13:40,202 --> 00:13:42,671
Well, do you know
where she might be?

276
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,739
Trying to work here.
well, you missed a spot.

277
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:47,375
(taps counter)
it's kinda sticky.

278
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:51,012
I'm sorry. i'm sorry.

279
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,783
I've had a really rough day.
i got kicked out of school,

280
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,785
My dad doesn't want me
to live with him,

281
00:13:56,852 --> 00:13:59,788
I can't stand my mom, i spent
the last $9 that i had on gas,

282
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:01,790
And so now i'm broke
and i'm homeless,

283
00:14:01,857 --> 00:14:04,292
And unless i can find my sister,
who i basically

284
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:06,294
Haven't talked to
in, like, a year,

285
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:09,164
I'm gonna have to become
a prostitute.

286
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:11,166
<i>and i don't even know how
to be a prostitute.</i>

287
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:13,168
I mean, really,
how much small talk is required?

288
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:15,970
And--and where do you even go?
and are b.j.s a must?

289
00:14:16,038 --> 00:14:17,972
Because if that's the case,
i am so not doing that.

290
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,575
Not that any of that information
is relevant

291
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:22,811
Unless you're a john.
not a john. owen.

292
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:24,212
Lily.

293
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:28,083
There's a gig
at the 6-0-7 tonight.

294
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,484
Chances are your sister
will be there.

295
00:14:30,552 --> 00:14:33,722
My friend's kinda dating her.
if you wanna go...

296
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:37,859
On a double date?
with a guy

297
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:41,029
That i just met five minutes
ago? you could be a psycho.

298
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:43,397
My shift ends in ten.
probably see your sister.

299
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,566
Don't want to come,
i'll give her your regards

300
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,036
And summarize the whole,
uh, prostitute thing.

301
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,040
I could change.

302
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:54,743
I have my suitcase
in the car.

303
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,577
Yeah. i'm just guessing,

304
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,880
But i don't think
that's gonna work.

305
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:02,617
You should try
something like this.

306
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:06,520
Your sister's always changing
for auditions and stuff.
(taps locker)

307
00:15:06,588 --> 00:15:08,056
Wow.

308
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:09,858
She's really changed.

309
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,895
I can't believe
that she has this.

310
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:16,798
<i>we went ice skating
at rockefeller center.</i>

311
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:18,800
<i>she snuck me
out of the house.</i>

312
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:21,269
<i>we took a bus across town.
my mom was so furious.</i>

313
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:23,604
It was so much fun.

314
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,807
We were, like,

315
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,876
Best friends.

316
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,249
You can go now.
already out the door.

317
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:35,750
(cell phone rings)

318
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:38,552
Oh, hello, daniel.

319
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,555
Hey. so, uh, look, i'm really
sorry to bother you,

320
00:15:41,623 --> 00:15:43,557
But i can't leave serena
one more message

321
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,559
And still call myself a man.

322
00:15:45,627 --> 00:15:48,062
Not that it's exactly manly
to be calling her "mother,"

323
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,765
But i-i-i-i
really need to know,

324
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,600
Uh, how mad is she?

325
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:54,568
Oh, i-i wouldn't worry.

326
00:15:54,636 --> 00:15:56,971
She hasn't gotten
your messages.

327
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,440
They take your cell phone away
when you're in jail.

328
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:00,942
Wait.

329
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,911
She's--she's still in jail?

330
00:16:02,978 --> 00:16:06,915
(billy idol's
"dancing with myself" playing)

331
00:16:06,982 --> 00:16:09,650
Hey. i think i need
a dress for prom.

332
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:13,688
Okay. but you're gonna
have to wear your own shoes.

333
00:16:13,755 --> 00:16:16,590
?on the floors of tokyo ?

334
00:16:16,658 --> 00:16:18,559
?a-down in london town's
a go-go ?

335
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:21,863
?a-with the record selection
and the mirror's reflection ?

336
00:16:21,931 --> 00:16:24,498
?i'm a-dancing with myself ?

337
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,967
?oh, oh, dancing with myself ?

338
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:29,938
?oh, oh, dancing with myself ?

339
00:16:30,005 --> 00:16:32,307
?if i had the chance,
i'd ask one to dance ?

340
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:37,212
?if i had the chance,
i'd ask one to dance ?

341
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,315
?ow ?

342
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:42,317
?oh, oh, oh, oh ?

343
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:45,220
?oh, oh, oh, oh ?

344
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:48,022
?oh, oh, oh, oh ?

345
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,325
?oh, oh, oh,
dancing with myself ?

346
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:52,994
?oh, oh, dancing with myself ?

347
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:55,796
?oh, oh, dancing with myself ?

348
00:16:55,865 --> 00:16:59,200
Get out, perv!
sorry.

349
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,569
You're taking long enough.

350
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:05,039
(sighs) do i looks like
i'm wearing a halloween costume?

351
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,441
No.

352
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:09,710
You look good.

353
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:13,647
Is this the moment where
you fall in love with me?

354
00:17:13,749 --> 00:17:15,649
Oh, it is, isn't it?

355
00:17:15,717 --> 00:17:18,819
You're totally falling in love
with me right now.
are you coming or not?

356
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:20,922
?if i had the chance,
i'd ask one to dance ?

357
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,590
Hello. i'd like to drop

358
00:17:22,657 --> 00:17:24,825
The charges against
serena van der woodsen.

359
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:27,828
There's been
a terrible misunderstanding.
well, you can talk to someone
about the charges,

360
00:17:27,897 --> 00:17:30,365
But your daughter's gone.

361
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:32,367
?oh, oh, dancing with myself ?

362
00:17:32,434 --> 00:17:35,403
?oh, oh, dancing with myself,
oh, oh ?

363
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:40,195
?stand and deliver! ?
(applause)

364
00:17:40,262 --> 00:17:42,964
?i'm the dandy highwayman who
you're too scared to mention ?

365
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:44,532
?i spend my cash ?

366
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,634
?on looking flash
and grabbing your attention ?

367
00:17:46,702 --> 00:17:49,870
?the devil take your stereo
and your record collection ?

368
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:51,372
?the way you look ?

369
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,508
?you qualify for
next year's old-age pension ?

370
00:17:53,576 --> 00:17:56,677
?stand and deliver ?

371
00:17:56,745 --> 00:18:00,248
?your money or your life ?

372
00:18:00,316 --> 00:18:03,684
?try and use a mirror ?

373
00:18:03,752 --> 00:18:07,388
?no bullet or knife ?

374
00:18:07,456 --> 00:18:09,690
?i'm the dandy highwayman
so sick of easy fashion ?

375
00:18:09,758 --> 00:18:12,026
Wow, you're, like,
really popular around here.

376
00:18:12,094 --> 00:18:14,529
Yeah, when you don't have
a lot of family at home,

377
00:18:14,597 --> 00:18:17,499
You gotta find it
somewhere else.
?...nothing is worth taking? ?

378
00:18:17,566 --> 00:18:21,002
?it's kind of tough
to tell a scruff ?

379
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:24,005
?the big mistake he's making,
stand and deliver ?

380
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:25,873
?your money or your life ?

381
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:27,408
It's kinda cool, right?

382
00:18:27,476 --> 00:18:29,844
Sure. yeah, cool place
to catch hepatitis.

383
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:31,412
Owen!

384
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,282
(can clatters)
missed our set, man!
it was awesome.

385
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,586
It was like... (howls)
it was wicked! ha ha!
shep, hey.

386
00:18:38,654 --> 00:18:41,722
Hey, who's the betty?
this your new girl?
no.

387
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,293
No. we're looking
for her sister.
no time to talk, guys. your
needs are gonna have to wait.

388
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:48,229
I have a plan. actually,
you know, it's more than a plan.

389
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:50,231
It's a mission.
but it's not just about me.

390
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:52,066
It's about my lady.
she's been wronged,

391
00:18:52,134 --> 00:18:54,369
And i'm gonna make it right.
(snaps fingers)

392
00:18:54,436 --> 00:18:57,405
What did they do to your lady,
tattoo the wrong butt cheek?
(woman) randy walter sheppard!

393
00:18:57,473 --> 00:18:59,940
My 20s are ticking away
as we speak,

394
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:02,377
And we gotta go now!

395
00:19:02,444 --> 00:19:03,778
Carol!
carol?

396
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:05,547
Lily?

397
00:19:05,614 --> 00:19:07,515
What are you doing here?

398
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:11,252
What are you guys doing
with my sister?
whoa. wait.
she's--she's your sister?

399
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,288
<i>she's your lady?
kind of.</i>

400
00:19:13,355 --> 00:19:15,823
No! lily, oh, my god.
it's so good to see you.

401
00:19:15,891 --> 00:19:19,060
How do you know owen? i'm so
sorry i haven't written more

402
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:20,961
Or called, like, ever.
are you totally mad?

403
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:23,331
Wait. what are you doing
in l.a.? is something wrong?

404
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:25,800
Is everything okay?
yeah. no, not really.
i have--i have to talk to you

405
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:29,504
About something,
and it's kind of major.
okay, and i wanna hear about it,
i mean, totally there for you,

406
00:19:29,572 --> 00:19:31,906
But right now i have to handle
something, and it cannot wait.
i know.

407
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:33,974
(lily) neither can this.
(carol) we'll talk in the car.

408
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:36,811
(shep) to the impala.
(lily) to the what? where?

409
00:19:36,878 --> 00:19:39,614
(owen) the mission is
on the move.
oh, my god, lily.
it's so good to see you.

410
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:42,917
I've missed you.
are you wearing my dress?
?stand and deliver ?

411
00:19:42,984 --> 00:19:45,486
?your money or your life ?

412
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:49,857
(playing swing version
of "stand and deliver")

413
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:53,361
(indistinct conversations)

414
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:56,564
(blair) oh, my god.
look at this place.

415
00:19:56,632 --> 00:19:58,165
I've always tried
to make my life

416
00:19:58,234 --> 00:20:00,167
Resemble the movie in my head,

417
00:20:00,236 --> 00:20:03,605
And tonight, no effort required.
voil? (laughs)

418
00:20:03,672 --> 00:20:05,607
Vote for prom king and queen?

419
00:20:05,674 --> 00:20:09,043
We don't do prom queen.
that's for suburban schools

420
00:20:09,111 --> 00:20:11,112
And the lame teen comedies
that are set at them.

421
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:13,715
We're doing it this year.
there's a tiara and everything.

422
00:20:13,782 --> 00:20:16,618
A tiara?

423
00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:19,120
But if you don't want
to vote for yourselves...

424
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,697
We were nominated. (laughs)
let's see.

425
00:20:29,765 --> 00:20:32,166
I mean, of course we were.

426
00:20:32,234 --> 00:20:35,836
(isabel) aw, you guys, i think
i'm getting sentimental.
it's true. this is
probably our last huddle.

427
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:37,838
Yeah, if you do this stuff
in college,

428
00:20:37,906 --> 00:20:40,040
People think
you're pathological.

429
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:42,143
Come on, ladies.
let's commit election fraud.

430
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,145
I can't wait
to see blair's face

431
00:20:44,212 --> 00:20:46,314
When she loses prom queen
to nelly.

432
00:20:46,382 --> 00:20:47,915
(giggles)

433
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:56,457
And look, i-i know
this thing with your mom

434
00:20:56,525 --> 00:20:59,460
Took on a life of its own,
but i just want to say

435
00:20:59,528 --> 00:21:02,463
That i'm sorry for starting it
in the first place.
it was just really upsetting

436
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:05,433
That--that you went to her
without giving me a warning.

437
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:08,436
I know, and normally i would
never do something like this,

438
00:21:08,504 --> 00:21:12,973
But lily is not like
other parents.
with good judgment, morals
and maternal instinct?

439
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,975
And when she said that she was
gonna take care of it,

440
00:21:15,043 --> 00:21:17,978
I never imagined that
you'd end up incarcerated.
the most frustrating part is

441
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:20,682
She thinks she did
take care of it.

442
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:25,853
Hey, soldier,
eyes up front.

443
00:21:25,921 --> 00:21:28,790
Well, i'm, uh, i'm glad
you let me bail you out

444
00:21:28,857 --> 00:21:31,426
Or let me call cece to,
'cause missing your prom

445
00:21:31,493 --> 00:21:35,095
Just to spite your own mother
is--is kinda--
something
only she would do, yeah.

446
00:21:35,163 --> 00:21:37,231
Thank you for--for getting me
to see that,

447
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:41,068
And thank you for
breaking the cycle of crazy.

448
00:21:41,136 --> 00:21:42,670
(laughs)

449
00:21:44,005 --> 00:21:46,841
So what happened to the beemer
that mom and dad got you?

450
00:21:46,908 --> 00:21:49,777
Oh, i sold it.

451
00:21:49,845 --> 00:21:51,245
For this?

452
00:21:51,313 --> 00:21:53,848
As if.
i gave it to this guy.

453
00:21:53,915 --> 00:21:55,850
He had
this really amazing idea.

454
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:57,985
It goes around your waist
like a belt

455
00:21:58,053 --> 00:21:59,954
So you can put stuff in it,
like a purse.

456
00:22:00,021 --> 00:22:03,691
Wow. that's
a really sound investment.

457
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:06,627
What's that supposed to mean?

458
00:22:06,695 --> 00:22:08,128
Nothing. nothing. (scoffs)

459
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:10,130
It just--your life isn't
exactly how you described.

460
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:13,300
You told mom that you were
making it out in l.a.

461
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:17,104
<i>i am making it. this is
what making it looks like...</i>

462
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:19,874
Before you've totally made it.

463
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:21,376
Carol, i've always thought

464
00:22:21,443 --> 00:22:24,211
That you were
really, really talented.

465
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,848
It's just--
is it really worth...

466
00:22:26,915 --> 00:22:29,650
Living your life,
you know...

467
00:22:31,553 --> 00:22:33,788
Like this?
well, it's not forever.

468
00:22:33,856 --> 00:22:35,890
Not once we get
shep's music video on mtv.

469
00:22:35,957 --> 00:22:38,893
I'm totally the star. a music
video equals national exposure.

470
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,397
It's the birth
of a new art form.
really? shep's band?

471
00:22:42,464 --> 00:22:44,766
Okay, i know you probably
wouldn't think so

472
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:47,802
Having met shep, but they're
actually kinda great.

473
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,638
Well, if they're so great,
then why don't you

474
00:22:50,706 --> 00:22:54,575
Give their demo to dad?
because he's dad,
and i'm doing this on my own.

475
00:22:57,579 --> 00:23:00,815
(turns volume up)
(lowered voice) listen, don't
tell anybody about who we are.

476
00:23:00,883 --> 00:23:03,818
Especially them.
why do you care
what they think?

477
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,022
And besides,
being us is awesome.
all that money comes
with strings attached, lily.

478
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:09,590
People treat you differently.

479
00:23:09,658 --> 00:23:11,258
Yeah, better.

480
00:23:11,326 --> 00:23:13,895
Wow. (laughs) could you
sound any more like mom?

481
00:23:13,962 --> 00:23:15,663
Of course i sound like mom.

482
00:23:15,731 --> 00:23:19,400
She's the only female role model
i've had since you bailed on us.

483
00:23:22,438 --> 00:23:25,039
Hey.

484
00:23:25,106 --> 00:23:26,841
I think we're here.

485
00:23:35,818 --> 00:23:37,184
(sighs)

486
00:23:37,252 --> 00:23:39,386
I never wanted
to be like my mother.

487
00:23:39,455 --> 00:23:42,122
I wanted to be open to life
and--and fearless

488
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,460
And not always thinking three
steps ahead--and consequences

489
00:23:45,527 --> 00:23:47,795
And what would people say
or what would my father think.

490
00:23:47,863 --> 00:23:49,797
Well, you have,
for the most part,

491
00:23:49,865 --> 00:23:53,300
With a few notable exceptions.

492
00:23:53,368 --> 00:23:55,302
That beautiful dinner
you made--

493
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,705
You were gonna propose,
weren't you?

494
00:23:59,675 --> 00:24:01,609
But you didn't.

495
00:24:01,677 --> 00:24:04,144
Because what i did to serena
made you fundamentally question

496
00:24:04,212 --> 00:24:07,214
The kind of person that i am.
you're unpredictable,
that's for sure.

497
00:24:07,282 --> 00:24:09,684
When i was younger,
that was damn exciting.

498
00:24:09,751 --> 00:24:11,452
You were
always surprising me.

499
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,389
I'm just doomed to repeat
my mother's mistakes.

500
00:24:15,457 --> 00:24:18,058
<i>why do you always
have to do that?</i>

501
00:24:18,126 --> 00:24:20,561
<i>dad, wait.
please don't walk away.</i>

502
00:24:20,629 --> 00:24:22,997
Our mistakes are ours alone
to repeat... or correct.

503
00:24:23,064 --> 00:24:27,067
I should forgive serena
for defying me.

504
00:24:27,135 --> 00:24:30,137
Or first maybe you need
to forgive cece.
oh, my mother
doesn't need forgiveness.

505
00:24:30,205 --> 00:24:34,108
She needs electroshock therapy.
you've got good reason
to be angry with her--

506
00:24:34,175 --> 00:24:37,812
<i>those messed up values
she passed on to you.
i'll follow you back.</i>

507
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,313
Until you let it go,

508
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:41,949
How can you move forward
with your own daughter?

509
00:24:42,017 --> 00:24:44,451
Cece's never gonna change,
lil.

510
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,388
But you still can.

511
00:24:47,455 --> 00:24:48,990
Thank you, rufus.

512
00:24:49,057 --> 00:24:52,693
(sighs)

513
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:56,263
I'm glad we can talk,
but as for everything else,

514
00:24:56,331 --> 00:24:59,000
I just don't know
where we stand right now.

515
00:24:59,067 --> 00:25:01,168
Even after 20 years,

516
00:25:01,236 --> 00:25:03,170
You're still not sure
who i am.

517
00:25:03,238 --> 00:25:05,172
It's not that i'm not sure.

518
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,275
It's just, i think
you're still figuring it out.

519
00:25:08,343 --> 00:25:10,511
Ah.

520
00:25:20,008 --> 00:25:21,976
And she sticks the landing.

521
00:25:22,044 --> 00:25:25,146
So is information
on this mission

522
00:25:25,214 --> 00:25:27,348
Revealed
on a need-to-know basis?

523
00:25:27,415 --> 00:25:30,251
Because i really need to know.
carol.

524
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:32,653
The so-called director
of our music video

525
00:25:32,721 --> 00:25:35,323
Took our money
and then jacked up his fee,

526
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,458
And now he's holding
our video hostage,

527
00:25:37,525 --> 00:25:40,328
And i am
a hostage negotiator.
yeah, just 'cause this dork's
uncle is john landis

528
00:25:40,395 --> 00:25:42,964
Doesn't mean
he's above the law.

529
00:25:43,031 --> 00:25:46,133
No richie rich film school kid
rips off me and my girl.
shep, i'm not your girl.

530
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:48,936
Right. she's--
she's more like my muse.

531
00:25:49,004 --> 00:25:50,838
Oh, sweet hand towels.

532
00:25:50,906 --> 00:25:53,140
So are we, like,
breaking and entering?

533
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:55,042
Seriously?
the window was unlocked,

534
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,211
So really,
it's just... entering.

535
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,681
And i thought investing
in purse belts was a bad idea.
thanks, lily.

536
00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:03,484
Since i know how much
you love following the rules,

537
00:26:03,551 --> 00:26:06,053
Why don't you just stay here,
far away from the party,

538
00:26:06,121 --> 00:26:08,789
Where people are
actually having fun?

539
00:26:08,857 --> 00:26:11,792
Owen, can you keep an eye
on her?

540
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,695
(toilet flushes)

541
00:26:14,763 --> 00:26:17,164
(sighs)

542
00:26:17,232 --> 00:26:20,368
What? just because my idea
of a good time

543
00:26:20,435 --> 00:26:22,870
Isn't getting arrested for
breaking into some guy's house,

544
00:26:22,938 --> 00:26:25,039
I'm automatically
a stuck-up goody two-shoes?

545
00:26:25,107 --> 00:26:27,875
It doesn't exactly make you
the life of the party.

546
00:26:27,943 --> 00:26:29,043
Where's the bar?

547
00:26:29,111 --> 00:26:30,544
I think it's this way.

548
00:26:30,612 --> 00:26:33,580
(swing music playing)

549
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,552
You made it!
yeah! there was
a last minute change of plans.

550
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,555
Yeah, i sprung her
out of the pokey.

551
00:26:41,623 --> 00:26:44,558
You can--
you can thank me later.
well, i just spent ten seconds
talking to you,

552
00:26:44,626 --> 00:26:47,361
So consider yourself repaid.
have fun.

553
00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:49,230
(laughs)
(chuckles)

554
00:26:49,298 --> 00:26:50,764
So, you know,

555
00:26:50,832 --> 00:26:54,402
Not that i imagined, uh,
much about my time at prom,

556
00:26:54,469 --> 00:26:56,904
But, um... it measures up.

557
00:26:56,972 --> 00:26:59,273
Did you ever imagine yourself
dancing at prom?

558
00:26:59,341 --> 00:27:02,276
That i did.
well, i am here
to make dreams come true.

559
00:27:02,344 --> 00:27:04,278
Come dance with me.
bailing you out of prison

560
00:27:04,346 --> 00:27:06,280
And dancing with you at prom
in one night? that's...

561
00:27:06,348 --> 00:27:10,851
Yeah, i'm here
to make things interesting.

562
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:13,354

Carol. hey.

577
00:27:58,133 --> 00:28:00,101
Wow. you, uh,

578
00:28:00,168 --> 00:28:01,735
You look amazing.

579
00:28:01,803 --> 00:28:04,905
Really? even more amazing than
in the video you won't give us?

580
00:28:04,973 --> 00:28:07,074
Look, i'm sorry about that.
i just, uh,

581
00:28:07,142 --> 00:28:09,810
I couldn't think of any other
way to get you to call me

582
00:28:09,878 --> 00:28:13,180
So i could explain--
you have a girlfriend.
nothing else to explain.

583
00:28:13,248 --> 00:28:14,982
I just want the video.

584
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,650
Hey. who is this?

585
00:28:16,718 --> 00:28:18,019
Is she available?

586
00:28:18,086 --> 00:28:19,353
Nah, man.

587
00:28:19,421 --> 00:28:21,922
Nah, she, uh,
she was just leaving.

588
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,591

It is, isn't it?

597

I can't believe you did this,
chuck.

602

You know how important
prom is to me!
blair, what's wrong?

603
00:29:09,271 --> 00:29:11,905
I caught him with these.
they're all marked

604
00:29:11,973 --> 00:29:14,007
With nelly yuki's name.
he's sabotaging me.

605
00:29:14,076 --> 00:29:16,510
My missing corsage, my dress,
the limo and hotel?

606
00:29:16,578 --> 00:29:20,814
(carol) we paid you 500 bucks
to shoot that thing.
we were friends then.
i was giving you a special rate.

607
00:29:20,882 --> 00:29:22,349
Our relationship's
changed now.

608
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:24,818
You can pay me
the balance in cash

609
00:29:24,886 --> 00:29:26,653
Or... i don't know...

610
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:28,689
What are you doing
saturday?

611
00:29:28,756 --> 00:29:31,692
Gross. my sister
would never sleep with you.

612
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,760
<i>yeah, 'cause she's dating me.</i>

613
00:29:33,828 --> 00:29:36,029
Shep, we're not dating.
we were never dating.

614
00:29:36,098 --> 00:29:38,532
Well, both of you don't know
carol very well,

615
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,501
'cause, yeah,
she totally slept with me.

616
00:29:40,569 --> 00:29:42,503
(clicks tongue)
pretty fun, too.

617
00:29:42,571 --> 00:29:45,539
You slept with
your music video director?
i didn't know
he had a girlfriend,

618
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,575
And i broke it off
as soon as i found out.

619
00:29:47,642 --> 00:29:49,610
But what he wants
to charge us?

620
00:29:49,677 --> 00:29:51,612
Might as well be
a million bucks.

621
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,181
And i know you probably think
i should ask mom and dad

622
00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:56,984
For the money, but...

623
00:29:57,051 --> 00:30:00,221
Whatever. i'll think
of something. it's fine.

624
00:30:00,288 --> 00:30:03,524
No, carol. it's not fine.

625
00:30:07,695 --> 00:30:10,797
Hi. i'm lily rhodes,
and that's my sister,

626
00:30:10,865 --> 00:30:12,933
And no one treats us
this way.

627
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:17,738
Okay. we already called
the cops, so...

628
00:30:17,805 --> 00:30:19,240
You guys are trespassing.

629
00:30:19,307 --> 00:30:22,743
It's cool, okay?
we're done here.

630
00:30:24,879 --> 00:30:26,480
Finally.

631
00:30:26,548 --> 00:30:29,049
Take the trash
back to the valley.

what did you just say?

Don't you have
anything better to do,

634
00:30:34,523 --> 00:30:36,457
Like get your butt tattooed?

635
00:30:36,525 --> 00:30:39,893
The only tattoo i'm getting
tonight is your face on my fist.

636

Ladies, come on.
no need to fight over me.

637

Okay. okay.

00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,651
Blair waldorf.

660
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:39,653
But that's impossible!
(applause)

661
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:42,690
Oh, my god. i won.

662
00:31:42,757 --> 00:31:45,192
This is my moment.

663
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,860
I own prom.

664
00:31:46,928 --> 00:31:49,162
<i>(penelope) and our king--</i>

665
00:31:49,231 --> 00:31:52,499
<i>nate archibald.</i>

666
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:54,501
Oh, my gosh!

667
00:31:54,569 --> 00:31:56,470
This is so great!

668
00:31:56,538 --> 00:31:58,171
(gasps) thank you!

669
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,006
Oh. thanks.

670
00:32:00,074 --> 00:32:01,275
(microphone feedback whines)

671
00:32:01,343 --> 00:32:03,644
Thank you, everyone.

672
00:32:03,712 --> 00:32:06,847
Oh, i can't believe blair won.
yeah,
who even voted for her?

673
00:32:06,914 --> 00:32:09,216
Me. about 150 times.

674
00:32:09,284 --> 00:32:11,852
I wasn't putting
the nelly yuki ballots in.

675
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,723
I was taking them out.
but what about what she said
you did to her limo

676
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:18,359
And hotel and her corsage?
her new dress looks better
without it.

677
00:32:18,426 --> 00:32:20,026
(camera shutter snaps)

678
00:32:20,094 --> 00:32:22,263
Give this to her.

679
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:24,931
It's to the penthouse
at the plaza.

680
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:28,135
You didn't think
you were the only one

681
00:32:28,202 --> 00:32:30,904
Who knew about
the scrapbook, did you?
(camera shutter snaps)

682
00:32:30,972 --> 00:32:33,607
Chuck, i...

683
00:32:33,675 --> 00:32:36,343
I can't believe
i'm saying this, but...

684
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:38,379
That was really sweet.

685
00:32:38,446 --> 00:32:41,448
I just wanted to make sure
she had the perfect night.

686
00:32:41,516 --> 00:32:43,216
(cheering)
your 2009 king and queen!

687
00:32:43,285 --> 00:32:45,552
<i>aw, who knew the mother-chucker</i>

688
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,054
<i>could also play
fairy godmother?</i>

689
00:32:48,122 --> 00:32:51,358
<i>but if c. just made
b.'s dreams come true,</i>

690
00:32:51,426 --> 00:32:52,126
<i>why does it feel like</i>

691
00:32:52,194 --> 00:32:55,462
<i>our queen is standing
with the wrong king?</i>

692
00:32:55,257 --> 00:32:56,991
You can't use the one

693
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,728
You already have on file?
(camera shutter snaps)

694
00:32:59,796 --> 00:33:02,798
Wait. let me
at least fix my makeup.
(camera shutter snaps)

695
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:05,667
(camera shutter snaps)

696
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:09,370
<i>(telephone rings)
(woman) are you ready
to do the workout?</i>

697
00:33:09,439 --> 00:33:11,272
<i>(women) yeah!
beginner's workout. stand with
your feet a little more...</i>

698
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,107
Jail?

699
00:33:13,175 --> 00:33:15,343
<i>you're in jail?</i>

700
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:19,314
(voice breaks) i know, mom.
i'm--i'm sorry.
you know,
if i was a better mother,

701
00:33:19,381 --> 00:33:22,283
I'd leave you in there, teach
you a lesson. you ran away.

702
00:33:22,351 --> 00:33:25,887
You just abandoned me
at the side of the road.
you know they only give you
one phone call, right?

703
00:33:25,955 --> 00:33:28,924
Oh, lily, the hopes and dreams
i have for you--

704
00:33:28,991 --> 00:33:34,930
An ivy league education,
life on the upper east side,

705
00:33:34,997 --> 00:33:36,898
Married to the richest man
see, that's the thing, mom--

706
00:33:36,966 --> 00:33:40,301
Those are your hope
and your dreams, not mine.

707
00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:43,572
I need to figure out what--
what i want, what i need.

708
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:45,740
Like a parole officer?
i'm getting in the car.

709
00:33:45,808 --> 00:33:49,043
You need to be far away
from your sister's influence.

710
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:52,747
Why? what's wrong with carol?
the fact that she's independent?

711
00:33:52,815 --> 00:33:55,450
That she thinks for herself?
that she does what she wants

712
00:33:55,518 --> 00:33:57,452
And not what other people
tell her to do?

713
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,454
How about your spare me
the heartache

714
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:01,055
And yourself the humiliation

715
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:05,226
And give up on this failed
experiment in rebellion?

716
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:07,762
What if this is not
an experiment?

717
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,132
What about if this
is me growing up?

718
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:15,370
Enough soul searching. i'm
calling your father's lawyer.

719
00:34:15,437 --> 00:34:17,873
We need to keep this thing
out of the papers.

720
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,875
(crying) please, mom,
i don't need a publicist.

721
00:34:19,942 --> 00:34:21,376
I need my mother.

722
00:34:21,443 --> 00:34:25,146
I'm trying to talk to you here,
and you're not...

723
00:34:25,214 --> 00:34:27,215
Hey, mom. got a sec?

724
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:31,953
Carol.

725
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:33,989
This is your chance

726
00:34:34,056 --> 00:34:35,957
To be a big sister

727
00:34:36,025 --> 00:34:39,828
And finally offer some actual
guidance to lily, advice.

728
00:34:39,896 --> 00:34:41,930
Her future's at stake.

729
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:44,733
Which is why she needs
to be far away from you.

730
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,735
This is how it's going to be,
mom.

731
00:34:46,802 --> 00:34:49,804
Lily's staying with me
for a while.
carol, just be reasonable.

732
00:34:49,872 --> 00:34:52,340
We both know the first time
that she breaks a nail,

733
00:34:52,408 --> 00:34:54,342
Rides a city bus--

734
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:56,645
Or god forbid--actually steps
foot in a public school,

735
00:34:56,712 --> 00:34:59,948
She'll come running home.
well, that's really up to lily,
now isn't it?

736
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:02,316
Just tell her to--to sit tight.
i'm coming for her.

737
00:35:02,384 --> 00:35:04,986
No, mom. you sit tight.
she'll call you later.

738
00:35:20,937 --> 00:35:22,503
(whispers) oh, goodness.

739
00:35:22,572 --> 00:35:25,040
(normal voice) mother. mom.

740
00:35:25,107 --> 00:35:27,542
Don't tell me you're
chasing me out of town.

741
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,510
I'm fleeing as fast as i can.

742
00:35:29,612 --> 00:35:31,880
Well, please stop.
i'm not going to apologize,

743
00:35:31,948 --> 00:35:33,949
But i love you,
and i know you love me.

744
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,684
Well, of course i love you,

745
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:37,285
My daughters,
my grandchildren.

746
00:35:37,352 --> 00:35:39,821
My only motivation is love.
on the contrary.

747
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:42,323
Your motives are quite suspect,
selfish even.

748
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:44,559
And you haven't always done
what's best for me.

749
00:35:44,627 --> 00:35:46,561
Well, i've done
the very best i could.

750
00:35:46,629 --> 00:35:48,196
You think serena's a handful?

751
00:35:48,263 --> 00:35:51,399
I would rather have
20 dan humphreys from brooklyn

752
00:35:51,467 --> 00:35:53,902
Instead of that boy you loved
from the valley.

753
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:58,006
Well, you took care of that,
didn't you?

754
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:01,009
And you ended up
with serena and eric

755
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:04,646
And the life you deserve.
it wasn't up to you to decide
what kind of life i should have.

756
00:36:04,714 --> 00:36:06,648
What else does it mean
to be a mother

757
00:36:06,716 --> 00:36:09,517
Than to make sure that your
child fulfills her destiny?

758
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:12,487
Well, i wanted to create
my own destiny.

759
00:36:12,554 --> 00:36:15,423
But that would have meant
losing you,

760
00:36:15,491 --> 00:36:18,660
And i was always too afraid
to do that.
until this afternoon,
evidently.

761
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:22,263
(sighs) mother, please,
i'm just asking you to stay.

762
00:36:22,331 --> 00:36:25,100
You know, being a mother myself,
i've made mistakes

763
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:27,602
That rival
if not outshine your own.

764
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,704
And i forgive you.

765
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,540
Lucky me.

766
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:35,677
You throw me out of your home,
and i get forgiven.

767
00:36:35,745 --> 00:36:38,379
Mother, just say thank you
and give me a hug.

768
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:40,381
I most certainly
am not gonna thank you

769
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:43,618
For the terrible things
you said.

770
00:36:43,686 --> 00:36:45,453
And as far as the hug goes,

771
00:36:45,521 --> 00:36:50,191
Well, you've always done exactly
as you pleased, haven't you?

772
00:37:07,342 --> 00:37:10,378
<i>(fountain of wayne's
"prom theme" playing)</i>

773
00:37:10,445 --> 00:37:13,281
Hey. you okay?

774
00:37:13,348 --> 00:37:16,250
This is supposed to be
the happiest day in high school.

775
00:37:17,853 --> 00:37:21,422
So why do i feel so sad?

776
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,391
Like something's ending?

777
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:26,161
Well, something is ending--

778
00:37:26,228 --> 00:37:27,495
High school.

779
00:37:27,563 --> 00:37:31,332
Not just school.

780
00:37:35,571 --> 00:37:37,172
You're my first love.

781
00:37:39,374 --> 00:37:41,776
(sighs) going
to my senior prom with you

782
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:44,645
Is something i've wanted
since i was 12 years old.

783
00:37:44,714 --> 00:37:46,214
And here we are,

784
00:37:46,281 --> 00:37:48,583
Like it was meant to be.

785
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:51,552
Yes.
this was supposed to happen.

786
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,755
I'm sure of it.

787
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,692
But now it has and--

788
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,529
Why are you talking
in the past tense?

789
00:38:01,597 --> 00:38:03,631
We're still here.

790
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:04,799
I know.

791
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:08,336
But this night already
feels like a memory.

792
00:38:10,339 --> 00:38:12,173
(sighs)

793
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:15,243
Just hold me...

794
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:18,246
Until the song's over.

795
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:23,718
Let's not waste these last
moments talking about it.

796
00:38:25,988 --> 00:38:28,389
(whispers) okay.

797
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:41,669
<i>?but tonight we feel
like we're stars ?/i></i>

798
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:48,977

801
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,667
Hey.

802
00:39:12,734 --> 00:39:14,169
There you are.

803
00:39:14,236 --> 00:39:15,870
Where's the prom king?

804
00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:18,072
We broke up.

805
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,607
What?

806
00:39:19,675 --> 00:39:21,609
But--but everything was
so perfect.

807
00:39:21,677 --> 00:39:24,578
It w--it was like
a fairy tale.

808
00:39:24,646 --> 00:39:28,917
It turns out fairy tales
end when they do for a reason.

809
00:39:28,984 --> 00:39:33,654
I really wanted to go to prom
with my high school boyfriend.

810
00:39:33,722 --> 00:39:36,925
And... now that i have...

811
00:39:36,992 --> 00:39:40,761
He feels like
your high school boyfriend.

812
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,231
I'm sorry.

813
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:45,834
Me, too--

814
00:39:45,901 --> 00:39:47,836
That you almost missed prom

815
00:39:47,903 --> 00:39:50,839
Because your mother
had you arrested...
(laughs)

816
00:39:50,906 --> 00:39:52,841
And your quasi
half-brother/ex-boyfriend

817
00:39:52,908 --> 00:39:54,342
Was your prom date.

818
00:39:54,409 --> 00:39:57,812
(laughs) you know, i actually
had a lot of fun tonight.

819
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,815
Dan and i made up, and i know
that whatever my mother did,

820
00:40:00,883 --> 00:40:03,117
She--she did out of love.

821
00:40:03,185 --> 00:40:07,255
And right now, i am with exactly
who i want to be with--

822
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:08,589
My best friend.

823
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:10,325
(lily) so thank you.

824
00:40:10,392 --> 00:40:12,327
Well, it's the least i can do

825
00:40:12,394 --> 00:40:14,395
Since i got you arrested
and everything.

826
00:40:14,463 --> 00:40:16,397
I didn't know
you were such a brawler.

827
00:40:16,465 --> 00:40:17,899
Neither did i.

828
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:20,401
I learned some things
last night...

829
00:40:20,469 --> 00:40:23,304
The biggest one being...

830
00:40:23,372 --> 00:40:25,306
That i've really missed you.

831
00:40:25,374 --> 00:40:27,808
You are high school to me--

832
00:40:27,877 --> 00:40:29,310
All of the boyfriends

833
00:40:29,378 --> 00:40:32,413
And mean girls and--
and tests and teachers

834
00:40:32,481 --> 00:40:35,416
And our crazy mothers...

835
00:40:35,484 --> 00:40:37,485
We--we went through it
together.

836
00:40:37,552 --> 00:40:40,588
We raised each other.

837
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:42,590
You're my sister.

838
00:40:42,657 --> 00:40:43,992

839
00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:45,793
So where's your car?

840
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:48,062
How do you think

841
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,899
You sold your car?

842
00:40:50,966 --> 00:40:53,634
What are we gonna do?

843
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:55,636
Walking in l.a.? wow, sis.

844
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:58,006

to teach you. come on.

845
00:40:58,073 --> 00:41:01,809
It's us. we travel in style
no matter how we travel.

846
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:04,245
(freur) ?doot ?

847
00:41:04,313 --> 00:41:07,581
?doot-doot ?

848
00:41:12,854 --> 00:41:15,390
?doot ?

849
00:41:15,457 --> 00:41:16,891
?doot-doot ?

850
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:21,629
<i>shoulder pads may come and go,
but a b.f.f. is forever...</i>

851
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:26,500
<i>because even when you're not
sure where you're headed,</i>

852
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:30,805
<i>it helps to know
you're not going there alone.</i>

853
00:41:30,872 --> 00:41:32,240
(cell phone alert beeps)

854
00:41:32,341 --> 00:41:34,542
<i>no one has all the answers,</i>

855
00:41:34,609 --> 00:41:38,479
<i>and sometimes the best
we can do is just apologize</i>

856
00:41:38,547 --> 00:41:40,815
<i>and let the past be the past.</i>

857
00:41:43,218 --> 00:41:45,954
<i>other times,
we need to look to the future</i>

858
00:41:46,021 --> 00:41:48,856
<i>and know that even when
we think we've seen it all,</i>

859
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:50,858
<i>life can still surprise us,</i>

860
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:53,828
<i>and we can still
surprise ourselves.</i>

861
00:41:53,895 --> 00:41:58,032
