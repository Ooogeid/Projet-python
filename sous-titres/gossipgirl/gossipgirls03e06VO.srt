00:00:09,652 --> 00:00:12,279
We're completely moogamous. it's just one of our games.

2
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:13,922
Chuck plays
the cheating bastard,

3
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:15,299
And i play the scorned woman.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,482
what happens when one day
you don't get there in time,

5
00:00:17,734 --> 00:00:20,554
<i>And he actually kisses someone else?
-my parents are artists.</i>

6
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:21,555
my sister's a musician.

7
00:00:22,087 --> 00:00:24,142
Just like going to an ivy is
your family's way,

8
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,448
Not going to college is mine.
-i met this woman.

9
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:29,570
I knew they'd take care
of my debts, so i proposed.

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,407
So what, you just disappeared?
it's the worst thing i've ever done.

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,437
Do you think the buckleys
would actually hurt him?

12
00:00:34,438 --> 00:00:37,595
<i>they might.
they clearly want revenge.</i>

Gossip Girl - 3X6
Enough About Eve

15
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:53,674
but what truly defines
Tonight's honored guest

16
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:56,880
Is not something that
can be easily categorized...

17
00:00:57,388 --> 00:00:58,773
(man) the distinguished-looking
gentleman at the podium

18
00:00:58,773 --> 00:01:01,358
Is an alumnus of the university.

19
00:01:01,425 --> 00:01:03,393
He will go on speaking
for a long time.

20
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:06,463
It is not important
that you hear what he says.

21
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:10,086
In closing,
those of us at the university

22
00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:11,034
Will have had the pleasure

23
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:13,098
Of getting to know
tonight's recipient,

24
00:01:13,137 --> 00:01:16,306
Know that she is a kind
and gentle soul. -hey, you okay?

25
00:01:16,374 --> 00:01:19,909
What? no.
no, i am not okay.

26
00:01:20,725 --> 00:01:24,056
...her humility, her devotion,
her love for us.

27
00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:25,215
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

28
00:01:26,593 --> 00:01:28,652
Miss vanessa abrams.

29
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:40,564
No.

30
00:01:43,974 --> 00:01:45,602
No!

31
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,437
No!

32
00:01:54,758 --> 00:01:55,411
bad dream?

33
00:01:56,085 --> 00:01:56,979
Don't tell me
it was "charade" again.

34
00:01:57,047 --> 00:01:59,816
I know how terrifying
you find walter matthau.

35
00:01:59,883 --> 00:02:04,213
Worse. i was in "all about eve."
that's not a hepburn movie.

36
00:02:04,213 --> 00:02:05,088
I know.

37
00:02:05,722 --> 00:02:07,557
I was bette davis.

38
00:02:08,272 --> 00:02:10,401
I've never been
bette davis before.

39
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:11,361
I'm audrey hepburn,

40
00:02:12,202 --> 00:02:14,163
Not some plain baby jane.

41
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,529
Who was eve?

42
00:02:20,213 --> 00:02:22,505
I couldn't see her face.

43
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:26,876
Blair, we both know
this is about n.y.u.

44
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,479
Now it may take time,

45
00:02:30,273 --> 00:02:31,948
But one day
you will hold that school

46
00:02:32,015 --> 00:02:34,718
In the palm
of your dainty hand.

47
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,302
I'm audrey.

48
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,703
Well, thank you, councilman.

49
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:55,872
I know my cousin
appreciates your support.

50
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:58,107
Yes, i'll be sure to tell him.
thanks.

51
00:02:58,591 --> 00:02:59,976
When did tripp decide
to run for congress?

52
00:03:00,043 --> 00:03:02,151
And should somebody tell him

53
00:03:02,151 --> 00:03:04,281
The election is not
until next year?

54
00:03:04,544 --> 00:03:06,283
Well,
after congressman kruger died,

55
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,818
A house seat opened up
in manhattan.

56
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:11,288
You know grandfather.
he figured, why wait?

57
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:15,091
Well, it's nice of you to help.
mm. well, tripp's a good guy,

58
00:03:15,451 --> 00:03:18,027
And with the buckleys buying up
all these attack ads

59
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:20,730
Against his campaign, i'm taking
it kind of personally.

60
00:03:20,798 --> 00:03:23,032
Yeah. have you--have you spoken
to bree lately?

61
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,101
No. you spoken to carter?

62
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:27,236
Not since my mom's wedding.

63
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:29,205
I've left him
a dozen messages.

64
00:03:29,273 --> 00:03:31,207
I don't know
if he's mad at me or--

65
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:33,543
Well, serena,
that's why i called.

66
00:03:34,102 --> 00:03:36,646
Supposedly the buckleys are
flying him out to galveston

67
00:03:36,714 --> 00:03:38,715
So he can work off his debt.

68
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:41,551
Work it off how?
on one of the family oil rigs.

69
00:03:42,062 --> 00:03:44,807
Th-that's crazy. it would
take him, like, 20 years

70
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:45,701
To earn that kind of money.

71
00:03:45,702 --> 00:03:47,139
i think they're more interested
in getting carter

72
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:49,092
Out to the gulf with
a bunch of texas roughnecks.

73
00:03:49,092 --> 00:03:52,545
So it's not like he's going
to be making a lot of friends.

74
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:55,681
No, please tell me
this is a joke.

75
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:59,536
Don't worry.
i have an idea.

76
00:04:03,507 --> 00:04:07,444
Yes. yes. lily loves
her jefferson airplane.

77
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:12,215
So, rufus,
how is married life?
well, at the risk of sounding
like a man deeply in love,

78
00:04:12,282 --> 00:04:15,618
Uh, each day gets better
than the one before.
it must be,

79
00:04:15,686 --> 00:04:18,688
If you're packing these
"welcome back, kotter" mugs.

80
00:04:18,756 --> 00:04:21,825
They'll look great
next to lily's china.
yeah, maybe we should hold off
on the sweathogs.

81
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:24,828
"in just a few short months,
freshman leader vanessa abrams

82
00:04:24,895 --> 00:04:27,364
Has tackled numerous social
and environmental issues."

83
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:30,800
What is that?
oh, it's just a wildly
flattering cover story

84
00:04:30,868 --> 00:04:33,470
On vanessa
in the n.y.u. paper.
it doesn't mean anything.

85
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:36,305
Except that she's a shoo-in
to give the toast

86
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:39,242
At the freshman dinner
on parents' weekend.
dan, can i borrow
your muscles?

87
00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:42,746
Is that true?
about the toast?
i... i got a message
from josh ellis.

88
00:04:42,813 --> 00:04:45,682
He's the alumnus who decides
who gives the toast.

89
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,585
Supposedly it's between me
and some other girl.

90
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:51,153
I probably won't get it.
well, speech or no speech,

91
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:53,289
I-i hope you're inviting
your parents.

92
00:04:53,357 --> 00:04:55,925
You're kidding, right?
my parents hate

93
00:04:55,993 --> 00:04:58,428
That i'm at a private college,
"buying" an elitist education.

94
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:00,363
"knowledge shouldn't be
for sale."

95
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:02,432
Sure, arlo and gabriela
are progressive,

96
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,568
But if they knew how much good
you were doing at the school,

97
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:07,637
I'm sure they'd come around.

98
00:05:07,705 --> 00:05:09,639
It would be kind of amazing
if they came

99
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:13,142
And, you know, actually approved
of something i was doing.

100
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,945
But whatever. i haven't been
chosen yet, so...

101
00:05:16,013 --> 00:05:17,580
Well, you will be.

102
00:05:17,648 --> 00:05:20,817
And tomorrow night, dan and i
will be there front and center.

103
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:23,085
Oh, um, yeah, you know what?

104
00:05:23,153 --> 00:05:25,121
Actually, olivia
just got back from japan.

105
00:05:25,188 --> 00:05:28,991
I was hoping we would hang out
tomorrow night.
so bring olivia.

106
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:32,495
Or not. it's your call.
i-i don't want to force you.

107
00:05:34,765 --> 00:05:37,434
What? what?
we--we just started dating.

108
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:40,336
Isn't it a little soon
for meet the parents?

109
00:05:40,404 --> 00:05:43,005
Not for olivia. she seems
really easygoing and into you.

110
00:05:43,073 --> 00:05:45,408
Yeah, seriously, dan.
play the parent card.

111
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:48,878
People like you more
when they meet our family.
it's true.

112
00:05:48,946 --> 00:05:52,081
All right. okay.
a-all right. i'll invite her.

113
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:53,716
Oh, that's awesome.

114
00:05:53,784 --> 00:05:55,785
It's gonna be a great night
for the humphreys.

115
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:59,255
And who knows?
maybe the abramses.

116
00:05:59,323 --> 00:06:01,558
Wait. bree's cousin hosts
a poker game?

117
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,861
Yeah, p.j. buckley. picture,
like, a young j.r. ewing

118
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:06,529
In earnest sewn jeans.

119
00:06:06,597 --> 00:06:09,231
And you really think he'll play
for carter's debt?

120
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:11,200
Oh, i've seen his friends
bet thoroughbreds,

121
00:06:11,268 --> 00:06:14,070
An island in the seychelles,
the knicks.

122
00:06:14,137 --> 00:06:16,473
Okay, but what makes you think
we'll win?

123
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,475
You're not exactly
a card shark.

124
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:21,143
Well, this one night
at the maidstone,

125
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:23,379
Bree told me
every one of p.j.'s tells.

126
00:06:23,447 --> 00:06:25,915
So you'll know exactly
when to call his bluff.

127
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:27,517
<i>wait. me?</i>

128
00:06:27,585 --> 00:06:29,986
Oh, yeah.
you're gonna be playing.

129
00:06:30,053 --> 00:06:31,788
Nate. (chuckles)

130
00:06:31,856 --> 00:06:33,022
No.

131
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,091
Well, serena, p.j. hates me.

132
00:06:35,158 --> 00:06:37,193
I mean, luckily,
he likes blondes, though.

133
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,296
And didn't you spend a summer
in monte carlo with your mom,

134
00:06:40,364 --> 00:06:42,765
When she dated
carlos mortensen?
i was 9.

135
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:46,268
Carlos taught me to play
using necco wafers as chips.

136
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:48,204
Well, just imagine
carter owes the buckleys

137
00:06:48,271 --> 00:06:50,773
Half a million necco wafers.

138
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:52,742
"...and ms. abrams
has even been mentioned

139
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,777
"as a contender to deliver
this year's toast

140
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:57,246
At the freshman dinner."
oh, my god. enough.

141
00:06:57,314 --> 00:07:00,216
I am in no mood to hear
you fawn over some girl

142
00:07:00,283 --> 00:07:02,351
With tacky accessories
who lives to recycle.

143
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:04,353
Blair,
didn't you ask mr. ellis

144
00:07:04,421 --> 00:07:06,723
If you could give
the freshman speech?

145
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,626
I put out feelers.
that's totally different.

146
00:07:09,693 --> 00:07:12,161
Of course. i'd be honored,
mr. ellis. thank you.

147
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:13,195
You.

148
00:07:13,263 --> 00:07:14,764
Yeah, blair, me.

149
00:07:14,832 --> 00:07:18,601
F.y.i.--one insipid article does
not mean people here like you.

150
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:21,404
The fever will pass,
like swine flu.

151
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:23,506
Really? huh.
then i wonder why josh ellis--

152
00:07:23,574 --> 00:07:25,775
He's this kind of important
alumni liaison--

153
00:07:25,843 --> 00:07:29,646
Told me to start working on my
toast for the freshman dinner.

154
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:36,145
(blair) what are you
standing there for? get in here!

155
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:40,557
I love it. you know,
cobalt's my favorite color.

156
00:07:40,624 --> 00:07:42,258
Push the button.

157
00:07:42,325 --> 00:07:45,704
<i>it's 11:45.
your hair is so pleasing.</i>

158
00:07:46,263 --> 00:07:48,230
it's a compliment watch.

159
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:51,200
And it flatters in three
different languages. oh, my god.

160
00:07:51,268 --> 00:07:54,170
This is the greatest watch
in the history of all watches.

161
00:07:54,237 --> 00:07:57,273
The swiss should be ashamed
for not thinking of it first.

162
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,710
So, um, what are you gonna do
this weekend to thank me?
uh, you know,

163
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:03,345
Actually, um, about that, i was
thinking i would invite you

164
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:05,314
To the parents' weekend
freshman dinner

165
00:08:05,382 --> 00:08:07,416
With, uh,
with me and my parents.

166
00:08:07,484 --> 00:08:10,753
And i-i know
you're probably exhausted.
i would love to.

167
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:13,056
Really? are you sure?
'cause you heard the part

168
00:08:13,123 --> 00:08:14,958
About my parents, right?
dan, the last three guys
i dated--

169
00:08:15,025 --> 00:08:17,226
I met their agent,
their manager,

170
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:18,661
Their publicist,

171
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:21,130
A personal trainer
who also read tarot cards,

172
00:08:21,198 --> 00:08:23,967
And i never met
a single one of their parents.

173
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:25,902
I would love to meet yours.

174
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:30,673
I missed you.

175
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:33,409
<i>it's 11:46.</i>

176
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:35,411
<i>your teeth shine like diamonds.</i>

177
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,013
(giggles) it's true.

178
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:38,815
It's very true.
mm.

179
00:08:38,882 --> 00:08:40,783
<i>(woman) you've reached
arlo and gabriela abrams.</i>

180
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:42,184
<i>pay it forward.
(beep)</i>

181
00:08:42,252 --> 00:08:43,953
Hey, mom, dad.

182
00:08:44,021 --> 00:08:46,956
Look, i know you guys
aren't happy that i'm at n.y.u.,

183
00:08:47,024 --> 00:08:48,891
But i'm giving this toast
tomorrow night,

184
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,960
And it's kind of a big honor.

185
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:54,563
And it would mean
so, so much to me if you came,

186
00:08:54,632 --> 00:08:57,133
So i hope you can.

187
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,735
<i>(gossip girl) careful, v.</i>

188
00:08:58,802 --> 00:09:01,203
<i>don't send out
your invitations just yet.</i>

189
00:09:01,271 --> 00:09:03,606
<i>we hear another girl
has her eyes on the prize.</i>

190
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:07,076
Montesquieu, churchill,
hobbes--

191
00:09:07,144 --> 00:09:09,345
I'm thinking my toast
should touch on...

192
00:09:09,412 --> 00:09:11,681
Tradition, virtue,

193
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:13,415
The divine right
of the monarchy.

194
00:09:13,483 --> 00:09:15,618
But, blair,
vanessa's giving the toast.

195
00:09:15,686 --> 00:09:17,620
Not when i'm done.

196
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:19,922
Mao, sun-tzu, of course,

197
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,125
Napoléon's always good
for a few zingers.

198
00:09:22,192 --> 00:09:25,061
<i>though things are rarely
as simple as they appear.</i>

199
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:28,665
(telephone rings)
this is josh ellis.

200
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,469
Well i'm thrilled
he changed your mind.

201
00:09:33,537 --> 00:09:37,106
Of course we'd still love
to have you give the toast.

202
00:09:37,174 --> 00:09:39,175
Yes, there was another girl,

203
00:09:39,242 --> 00:09:41,077
But we hadn't fully committed
to her.

204
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:43,046
We definitely want you.

205
00:09:43,113 --> 00:09:45,514
Great. i'll see you tomorrow,
mr. ellis.

206
00:09:47,517 --> 00:09:49,686
Good-bye, jet lag.
hello, triple ristretto.

207
00:09:49,753 --> 00:09:51,187
Yes.
what was that?

208
00:09:51,254 --> 00:09:52,855
Just a surprise.

209
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:55,958
<i>and something tells me
we're in for a show.</i>

210
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,595
Now, ms. waldorf,
if this is about

211
00:10:00,595 --> 00:10:02,365
Letting you give
the freshman toast,

212
00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:05,869
Like i told you last week,
i'd love to help you out, but--

213
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:09,637
Actually, mr. ellis,
i'm here to help you.

214
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:11,166
Simply put,

215
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,430
Vanessa abrams is
a tired clich?from the 7-1-8.

216
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,473
The preachy "i hate the man"
toast she no doubt has in mind

217
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,260
Won't inspire the kind
of deep-pocket donations

218
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,088
This school needs.

219
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:24,102
You need a speaker more like,
well, me.

220
00:10:24,102 --> 00:10:27,668
Ms. waldorf, yes, last week
i narrowed my search

221
00:10:27,736 --> 00:10:30,404
Down to two candidates.
but just moments ago,

222
00:10:30,471 --> 00:10:33,373
Our first choice, olivia burke,
accepted our invitation.

223
00:10:33,441 --> 00:10:35,375
Then why does
activist abrams

224
00:10:35,443 --> 00:10:37,912
Still think
she's giving the toast?

225
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:39,446
Vanessa was the other student
that we were considering.

226
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:42,416
You see, initially, olivia
wasn't planning on attending,

227
00:10:42,483 --> 00:10:44,351
But then luckily,
for everyone,

228
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:46,987
Her new boyfriend
convinced her otherwise.

229
00:10:47,055 --> 00:10:50,324
Yes, she is very famous.

230
00:10:50,391 --> 00:10:53,260
Mm-hmm.
but she's
a 2-quadrant speaker.

231
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:57,397
Is it smart to lose everyone
over 25 on parents' weekend?

232
00:10:57,465 --> 00:11:00,434
Besides, actresses are
notoriously unreliable.

233
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:03,938
Ms. waldorf, even if
olivia's schedule did change,

234
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:05,706
Vanessa would still be
my next choice.

235
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:08,542
So...

236
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,646
I'm very busy.

237
00:11:16,852 --> 00:11:20,121
you are not
trying to steal my toast.

238
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:22,489
Nobody told you.

239
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,892
Olivia, your dear roommate,
is giving the toast.

240
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,927
Poor vanessa.

241
00:11:26,995 --> 00:11:29,196
Always the understudy,
never the star.

242
00:11:29,264 --> 00:11:32,800
Olivia's the other girl?
(singsongy grunt)

243
00:11:32,868 --> 00:11:36,904
And i was the one
who told dan to bring her.

244
00:11:36,972 --> 00:11:40,274
Irony certainly can be cruel.

245
00:11:40,341 --> 00:11:42,676
Did i overhear
your long-absent mother

246
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,112
Is coming to hear you speak?
(whispers) tragic.

247
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,015
Well, i'll just tell olivia
how much this toast means to me,

248
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,751
And then she'll step down.

249
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:53,654
Yeah, probably. though,
then again, she might not.
nice try, blair.

250
00:11:53,721 --> 00:11:56,590
Well, i'm just saying, we all
know olivia loves the spotlight.

251
00:11:56,658 --> 00:11:58,592
She is an actress.

252
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,462
Then i'll ask dan
not to bring her.
another idea with some merit.

253
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,365
See, that's where you and i
are different.

254
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,302
I would never put my fate
in someone else's hands,

255
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:11,605
And that's why i always win,
and you lose.

256
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:14,208
So good luck
with your honesty.

257
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:17,178
Maybe you and mom
could take in a show instead.

258
00:12:51,713 --> 00:12:53,948
(man) well, well, well.

259
00:12:54,015 --> 00:12:56,951
Nate archibald.
you looking for a game?

260
00:12:57,018 --> 00:12:59,887
I'm--i'm afraid we--
we don't have a seat for you.

261
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:02,857
Oh, i'm not here to play.
she is.

262
00:13:02,924 --> 00:13:05,759
That is unless you're afraid
to play a girl.

263
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,996
Buy-in's $25,000.

264
00:13:13,969 --> 00:13:16,303
(lowered voice)
that's a lot of money.

265
00:13:16,371 --> 00:13:18,839
(lowered voice) so don't lose.

266
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:23,978
Pull up a seat, darlin'.

267
00:13:34,222 --> 00:13:36,023
You're kidding, right?

268
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:35,159
You're the one who told me
to invite her. i know.

269
00:13:35,226 --> 00:13:38,128
Remember the whole
"people like you better

270
00:13:38,196 --> 00:13:41,231
When they meet your family"thing?
exactly. you don't want to be outshone by your family,

271
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:44,634
And not to mention, she's been
in japan for ten days.

272
00:13:44,703 --> 00:13:47,871
I mean, she's probably having
reverse culture shock.
yeah, okay. all right.

273
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:51,408
So do you have any, uh,
non-insane reasons?
well, i'm just saying,

274
00:13:51,475 --> 00:13:53,977
Why don't you do something
more casual but also romantic?

275
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:58,115
Dinner, just the two of you. you
can make your special chicken.
my special chicken? what?

276
00:13:58,183 --> 00:14:00,250
Vanessa, what is going on?
nothing.

277
00:14:00,318 --> 00:14:02,619
Uh-huh. i need a refill.

278
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:12,062
Okay, but you have to promise me
you won't say anything,

279
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,798
Because this officially makes me
the worst roommate ever.

280
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:16,834
Just tell me.

281
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:19,937
Olivia's freaking out
about meeting your parents.

282
00:14:20,004 --> 00:14:22,339
What? i-i talked to her,
like, two hours ago,

283
00:14:22,406 --> 00:14:25,308
And she said she was
looking forward to it.
i guess she changed her mind

284
00:14:25,376 --> 00:14:28,746
Or doesn't want
to hurt your feelings.

285
00:14:28,813 --> 00:14:32,241
<i>she just feels that
it's way, way too soon.</i>

286
00:14:32,242 --> 00:14:34,077
yeah. you know, i knew--
i knew this was gonna happen.

287
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:35,219
Really? i mean, yeah, of course.
and i know this is my fault,

288
00:14:35,286 --> 00:14:37,621
But tell her you want
to have a great night,

289
00:14:37,688 --> 00:14:41,695
Just the two of you.
and make my special chicken?

290
00:14:44,262 --> 00:14:46,997
Hey, abrams, thank you
for, uh, the heads-up.

291
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:52,389
What are friends for?

292
00:14:56,274 --> 00:14:59,476
Trip queens.

293
00:15:03,043 --> 00:15:05,579
It just--
it doesn't feel right,

294
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:07,981
You know, taking
a beautiful woman's money.

295
00:15:08,048 --> 00:15:10,049
I'm getting crushed here.
hey, don't worry.

296
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,786
P.j.'s on tilt.
this is where you hook him.

297
00:15:12,853 --> 00:15:14,954
Archibald, you want
to call it a night?

298
00:15:15,022 --> 00:15:17,291
I can spot you cab fare.

299
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:20,661
Just get him to bet carter
and remember the tells.

300
00:15:20,728 --> 00:15:24,264
Actually, p.j.,
we're gonna buy back in.

301
00:15:24,332 --> 00:15:27,167
But we're upping the stakes.

302
00:15:28,703 --> 00:15:30,904
What are you thinking
of playing for?

303
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,972
Yeah, not likely.

304
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,841
How about carter baizen?

305
00:15:38,713 --> 00:15:41,047
I get it.
you're--you're carter's girl.

306
00:15:41,115 --> 00:15:44,117
Well, bad news, sweetheart,

307
00:15:44,185 --> 00:15:46,820
Carter's debt is a lot more
than you're showing.

308
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:52,359
You know, can we get some,
uh, some privacy?

309
00:15:55,062 --> 00:15:57,230
I tell you what.
you bet carter,

310
00:15:57,298 --> 00:15:58,998
And i'll bet...

311
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:00,934
A photo of tripp van der bilt...

312
00:16:04,238 --> 00:16:08,675
From the night
of his bachelor party.
(chips clink)

313
00:16:08,743 --> 00:16:10,877
(lowered voice)
your family will kill you.

314
00:16:10,945 --> 00:16:13,714
That'll cost tripp the election.
(lowered voice)
like i said, don't lose.

315
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:22,689
Let's play some cards.

316
00:16:22,757 --> 00:16:26,560
I'm sorry to cancel on you
like this, mr. ellis.

317
00:16:26,627 --> 00:16:29,195
You have a backup speaker,
right?

318
00:16:29,263 --> 00:16:31,865
Okay. good.

319
00:16:31,932 --> 00:16:33,767
All right. uh, good-bye.

320
00:16:33,835 --> 00:16:35,935
(beep)
everything okay?

321
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:38,572
Um, dan has decided
to cook dinner for me

322
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,674
Instead of going out
with his parents.

323
00:16:40,742 --> 00:16:43,243
He probably just wants
more one-on-one time.

324
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,380
I'll bet he has something
special planned, like chicken.

325
00:16:46,447 --> 00:16:48,982
(laughs) yeah.
or something.

326
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:53,920
Yeah. um, i brought you this.
it's an anime goblin claw.

327
00:16:53,988 --> 00:16:56,690
They are huge
in japan right now.

328
00:16:56,758 --> 00:16:59,526
I just thought
it was kind of funny.
thanks.

329
00:16:59,594 --> 00:17:01,661
I shouldn't be freaking out,
right?

330
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,765
I mean,
i can meet his parents anytime.
yeah.

331
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:07,634
(cell phone rings)
um, i'll be right back.

332
00:17:07,702 --> 00:17:10,270
(whispers) okay.

333
00:17:15,276 --> 00:17:18,912
Hi, mr. ellis.

334
00:17:20,615 --> 00:17:24,183
No.

335
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,686
I'd still love
to give the toast.

336
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,722
Thank you.
(snaps cell phone shut)

337
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,825
Tell machiavelli
i hope she enjoys my toast.

338
00:17:31,893 --> 00:17:35,429
Vanessa's giving the toast
again.

339
00:17:35,496 --> 00:17:38,064
And she's got
some big pink claw thing.

340
00:17:38,132 --> 00:17:41,100
Well, i don't know about that.
however, phase one is complete.

341
00:17:41,168 --> 00:17:43,102
But even with olivia
out of the way,

342
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,071
You still don't have
the toast.

343
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:47,073
Oh, my goodness.

344
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:48,475
You're right.

345
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,244
Thank you, amalia.

346
00:17:51,312 --> 00:17:54,448
When are you going to learn
to have a little faith?

347
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,451
Chuck, my love,

348
00:17:57,518 --> 00:18:01,020
I was thinking, remember
our game from the summer?

349
00:18:01,088 --> 00:18:04,257
Well, i have the perfect target
already picked out.

350
00:18:06,594 --> 00:18:08,862
So what's a sweet girl
like you

351
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,499
Doing with a guy
like carter baizen, hmm?

352
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:15,769
You heard what happened
to my sister, right?

353
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:17,236
Heartbroken,

354
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,906
30 pounds fatter.

355
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,375
Bet.

356
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:31,150
$20,000.

357
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,132
All in.

358
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,768
You sure you want to play
this hand for carter?

359
00:18:51,105 --> 00:18:52,539
Fine.

360
00:18:52,607 --> 00:18:53,840
I'll call.

361
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,011
Kings.

362
00:19:04,084 --> 00:19:05,886
Aces.

363
00:19:05,953 --> 00:19:09,856
You know, a picture really is
worth a thousand words.

364
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:11,391
(chuckles)

365
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,393
Or in this case,

366
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,829
An election.

367
00:19:15,897 --> 00:19:18,899
(beep)
nate, thanks for stopping by.

368
00:19:21,101 --> 00:19:24,604
<i>uh-oh. looks like
carter's going down to texas,</i>

369
00:19:24,672 --> 00:19:29,275
<i>and tripp's career is
going up in smoke.</i>

370
00:19:38,288 --> 00:19:39,756
Hey. you made it.

371
00:19:39,824 --> 00:19:42,091
Hey.

372
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:44,427
Rufus! (laughs)
(laughs)

373
00:19:44,495 --> 00:19:47,831
Oh! come here.
would you let me look at you?

374
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:50,299
Lay off the caffeine, huh?
it's giving you wrinkles.

375
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:53,069
Ah. i'm sorry
arlo couldn't make it.

376
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:56,139
He says hello. he had to finish
installing the solar panels

377
00:19:56,206 --> 00:19:58,141
On the chicken coop
at the co-op.
(chuckles)

378
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,577
We have been so busy
organizing the local 72,

379
00:20:00,645 --> 00:20:03,446
The, uh, the union
for the burlington cheesemakers.

380
00:20:03,514 --> 00:20:04,848
Aha.
yeah.

381
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,183
Yeah.
mom, this is lily.

382
00:20:07,251 --> 00:20:10,854
Oh, it is such a pleasure to
finally meet vanessa's mother.
gabriela.

383
00:20:10,922 --> 00:20:13,489
Oh, rufus... (laughs)
we're not in brooklyn anymore.

384
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:16,593
Uh, uh, i'm still moving in.
it's lily's place.

385
00:20:16,661 --> 00:20:19,896
Oh, it is both of our place.

386
00:20:19,964 --> 00:20:22,899
Uh, mom, didn't you bring that
for lily?

387
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:25,268
(laughs) oh, yes, i did.
homemade strawberry rhubarb.

388
00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:26,803
Thank you.
oh. mmm.

389
00:20:26,871 --> 00:20:30,740
Wow. well, you and your husband
must be so proud of vanessa.

390
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:33,342
Oh, yes.
vanessa has always been

391
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,779
A very thoughtful
and driven young woman.

392
00:20:35,846 --> 00:20:38,114
This school is
the perfect fit for her.

393
00:20:38,182 --> 00:20:40,850
Well...

394
00:20:40,918 --> 00:20:43,252
Here we go.
(chuckles)
to be completely honest,

395
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,422
My husband and i don't believe
in private universities.

396
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,892
Knowledge should not
be for sale.

397
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,994
Well...
well... yes. oh.

398
00:20:51,062 --> 00:20:52,596
Who's hungry?
lovely.

399
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,668
I must confess,
i've missed our little game.

400
00:20:58,736 --> 00:21:01,638
Though it appears
your lady is late.

401
00:21:01,706 --> 00:21:05,374
Actually, there she is now.

402
00:21:10,114 --> 00:21:11,648
She's a guy.

403
00:21:11,716 --> 00:21:14,084
Who took my speech
at the freshman dinner

404
00:21:14,151 --> 00:21:16,552
And gave it
to vanessa abrams.

405
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:19,155
He double-crossed me, and i...
demand satisfaction.

406
00:21:19,223 --> 00:21:22,092
You still up for it?

407
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,160
Mm, my wonderful man.

408
00:21:24,228 --> 00:21:27,163
I'll just go powder my nose
for ten minutes?

409
00:21:27,231 --> 00:21:28,999
I only need five.

410
00:21:41,746 --> 00:21:43,479
Can i help you?

411
00:21:43,547 --> 00:21:45,148
Oh, definitely.

412
00:21:45,215 --> 00:21:48,852
I don't know if p.j. is not
as stupid as he looks,

413
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:52,455
But, nate, those tells were
wrong. what are you gonna do?

414
00:21:52,523 --> 00:21:55,859
Well, of course i had to tell
my grandfather what happened.

415
00:21:55,926 --> 00:21:58,594
I mean, i have
completely destroyed

416
00:21:58,663 --> 00:22:02,532
Tripp's political career.
no. no, nate.
let me talk to him. please.

417
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:06,970
He needs to know that you
were trying to help me.
i appreciate that, but i'm not
dragging you into this mess.

418
00:22:08,673 --> 00:22:11,875
Oh,
it's william right here.
nate.

419
00:22:11,942 --> 00:22:14,210
No. serena, i can handle it.
hello, grandfather.

420
00:22:18,282 --> 00:22:19,448
Ugh.

421
00:22:22,219 --> 00:22:24,154
Is, uh, nate archibald
in there?

422
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:26,156
He's got a phone call--
p.j. buckley.

423
00:22:26,223 --> 00:22:29,392
Okay. yeah. i'll tell him.
thank you.

424
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:31,294
P.j. thinks
he won the picture.

425
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:35,165
Yeah, i have the real one.

426
00:22:35,232 --> 00:22:40,837
I mean, i feel bad about lying
to serena, but it worked.

427
00:22:40,905 --> 00:22:42,138
Okay.

428
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:49,579
Gabriela, this strawberry
rhubarb jam to die for.

429
00:22:49,646 --> 00:22:52,448
Thank you. it's the agave.
i refuse to use sugar.

430
00:22:52,516 --> 00:22:56,119
Mmm.
mm-hmm. oh, rufus, will we
be seeing daniel at the dinner?

431
00:22:56,187 --> 00:22:58,487
(mouth full) i had hoped so,
but unfortunately not.

432
00:22:58,555 --> 00:23:01,725
He has a date tonight.
(mouth full) with vanessa's
roommate, olivia burke.

433
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:03,626
Didn't she tell you?
lily.

434
00:23:03,694 --> 00:23:06,730
She is a very famous actress.

435
00:23:06,797 --> 00:23:09,365
I'm afraid i don't worship
at the altar

436
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:12,168
Of shallow
hollywood celebrities.
oh. (chuckles)

437
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:14,470
But apparently your school does.
mom, can you
not do this right now?

438
00:23:14,538 --> 00:23:17,207
Honey, these institutions
are businesses first.

439
00:23:17,274 --> 00:23:20,043
I mean, was this girl
even qualified to enter...
(cell phone rings)

440
00:23:20,111 --> 00:23:24,513
Or was it purely
a publicity stunt?
well, that's my shallow
hollywood roommate...

441
00:23:24,581 --> 00:23:27,383
(ring)
and also one of the nicest,
smartest people

442
00:23:27,451 --> 00:23:30,186
I've met at college.
excuse me.

443
00:23:33,057 --> 00:23:35,191
Hey. how is your date?

444
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:36,359
Great.

445
00:23:36,426 --> 00:23:38,094
Dan's making indian chicken.

446
00:23:38,162 --> 00:23:39,595
Moroccan, actually.

447
00:23:39,663 --> 00:23:43,967
Oh. uh, look, i know i shouldn't
be asking you this.

448
00:23:44,034 --> 00:23:45,534
I was just wondering,

449
00:23:45,602 --> 00:23:48,604
Why did dan change his mind
about me meeting his parents?

450
00:23:48,672 --> 00:23:50,706
I must have done something
to scare him off.

451
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:53,743
You can tell me the truth. i promise.
no, you didn't do anything.

452
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:55,411
Well, i must have.

453
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:57,647
You know what?
i'm just gonna ask him.

454
00:23:57,714 --> 00:23:59,849
No!

455
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:02,852
Look, dan's parents are just

456
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,988
Really judgmental,
and they're always going on

457
00:24:05,055 --> 00:24:07,924
About celebrities
and the dumbing down of culture.
so he's worried

458
00:24:07,992 --> 00:24:11,627
His parents will think i'm
some shallow hollywood pinhead?

459
00:24:11,695 --> 00:24:14,164
No--
like dan's embarrassed
to introduce me to them?

460
00:24:14,231 --> 00:24:17,901
Olivia, dan just wants
to protect you from them.

461
00:24:17,968 --> 00:24:19,502
You know what, vanessa?

462
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:23,639
You don't need to make excuses
for him, okay? i get it.

463
00:24:23,707 --> 00:24:25,741
I gotta go.

464
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:29,712
(white lies) ?just give me
a second, darling ?

465
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,782
So where do you get
your hair cut?

466
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,750
Oh, uh, trumper's,
off piccadilly.

467
00:24:37,121 --> 00:24:38,587
Tut, tut.

468
00:24:38,655 --> 00:24:40,656
I'm not that kind of girl.

469
00:24:40,724 --> 00:24:42,926
(chuckles)
do you have a boyfriend?

470
00:24:44,188 --> 00:24:46,495
Not exactly.

471
00:24:46,563 --> 00:24:48,764
Wait.
what for?

472
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,433
Ah.

473
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,972
<i>what the... mr. ellis.</i>

474
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,341
Blair waldorf. oh, lord.

475
00:24:58,408 --> 00:25:00,609
I-i have to go.

476
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,813
Don't you run away from me.

477
00:25:05,883 --> 00:25:09,452
Hey! have you no sense
of decency?

478
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,021
Well, you got your kiss.

479
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:14,924
Number 27
on the tribeca scavenger hunt--

480
00:25:14,992 --> 00:25:17,727
Kiss the chuck bass.
(laughs)

481
00:25:17,794 --> 00:25:19,195
Check.

482
00:25:19,263 --> 00:25:22,698
I expect more from
a representative of a college!

483
00:25:22,766 --> 00:25:25,434
And the toast?
oh, a deal's a deal.
it's all yours.

484
00:25:27,271 --> 00:25:29,873
I should call vanessa,
break the bad news.

485
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,107
Allow me.

486
00:25:31,175 --> 00:25:33,709
We're rivals,
but friends at heart.

487
00:25:33,777 --> 00:25:35,211
Until tonight.

488
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,546
Out, you cable-knit queen!

489
00:25:37,614 --> 00:25:39,249
You were late.

490
00:25:39,316 --> 00:25:42,318
I got caught in a text flurry
with dorota. i'm sorry.

491
00:25:42,386 --> 00:25:45,054
I have to get uptown
for a dinner.

492
00:25:45,122 --> 00:25:46,990
I assume you're skipping
the parents' thing?

493
00:25:47,057 --> 00:25:49,058
I may pop in...

494
00:25:49,126 --> 00:25:52,495
For vanessa's toast,
just for laughs.

495
00:25:52,562 --> 00:25:55,198
Are you upset
because you kissed a   guy?

496
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:59,035
I'm upset because i kissed
somebody that wasn't you.

497
00:25:59,103 --> 00:26:01,938
You really think
i've never kissed a guy before?

498
00:26:02,006 --> 00:26:03,907
Love me?
always.

499
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,989
Oh, well. i tried.

500
00:26:20,057 --> 00:26:23,359
Hi.

501
00:26:23,427 --> 00:26:24,994
Guess i should, uh,

502
00:26:25,062 --> 00:26:27,063
Work on keeping
my opinions to myself.

503
00:26:27,131 --> 00:26:28,864
(chuckles)
you think? (chuckles)

504
00:26:28,933 --> 00:26:32,435
I just wanted to say,
tonight i will promise

505
00:26:32,502 --> 00:26:34,837
To keep an open mind
about your school,

506
00:26:34,905 --> 00:26:36,639
About everything.

507
00:26:36,706 --> 00:26:38,741
When you hear my toast,

508
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:42,145
I think you'll understand why
this is the right place for me.

509
00:26:42,212 --> 00:26:44,047
Okay.

510
00:26:44,114 --> 00:26:46,416
Come here.

511
00:26:46,483 --> 00:26:48,451
(chuckles) i hope.
(laughs)

512
00:26:48,518 --> 00:26:51,620
So what do you think about
going out to eat tonight?

513
00:26:51,688 --> 00:26:54,057
Or we could just go
to the parents' dinner.

514
00:26:54,124 --> 00:26:57,427
Are you sure? i mean, my parents
are--are gonna be there.

515
00:26:57,494 --> 00:27:00,563
Well, then i better be
on my best behavior.

516
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,865
Pick me up in an hour?

517
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:03,899
Okay.

518
00:27:03,968 --> 00:27:06,902
<i>as for lonely boy,</i>

519
00:27:06,971 --> 00:27:09,805
<i>i suspect tonight's going to be
strictly a family affair...</i>

520
00:27:09,873 --> 00:27:11,240
<i>to remember.</i>

521
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:34,636
I'll be right back.
i just have to find someone.

522
00:27:37,474 --> 00:27:42,244
Don't you just adore
the national arts club?

523
00:27:42,312 --> 00:27:44,813
Ahh.
it's so "age of innocence."

524
00:27:44,881 --> 00:27:46,849
Are you looking
for mr. ellis?

525
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:50,319
Because he asked me to give you
a message. now what was it?

526
00:27:50,387 --> 00:27:52,855
Oh, you're not giving
the toast,

527
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:55,491
I am, and there's nothing
you can do about it.

528
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:58,327
What are you talking about?
i won, like always.

529
00:27:58,395 --> 00:28:02,064
Please... don't do this.

530
00:28:02,132 --> 00:28:04,566
Oh, my god. are you begging?

531
00:28:04,634 --> 00:28:06,202
My mom is here,

532
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:09,438
And you have no idea
what this speech means for me.

533
00:28:09,506 --> 00:28:11,907
Please. you're embarrassing
yourself even more than usual.

534
00:28:11,975 --> 00:28:13,675
When will you learn?

535
00:28:13,743 --> 00:28:17,579
Some people are simply better
than others.

536
00:28:25,722 --> 00:28:28,124
Don't worry. i'm sure
they're gonna love you.

537
00:28:28,191 --> 00:28:31,460
Uh-huh. so you think they're
gonna want my autograph?

538
00:28:31,528 --> 00:28:33,762
(chuckles) i-i doubt it.

539
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,698
Dan,
what are you doing here?
please.
miss the freshman dinner?

540
00:28:36,766 --> 00:28:40,236
Dad, lily, this is olivia.
rufus humphrey. dan has told us
so much about you.

541
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:42,304
Oh,
that dress is beautiful.

542
00:28:42,372 --> 00:28:45,574
I recognize it from
the herve leger show.
oh, yeah?

543
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:49,445
Except it wasn't on the runway,
so that's kind of impossible.

544
00:28:49,513 --> 00:28:51,514
Max azria's, like,
one of my best friends.

545
00:28:51,581 --> 00:28:53,582
He does me crazy favors.

546
00:28:57,054 --> 00:28:59,455
Are you feeling okay?
totes.

547
00:28:59,523 --> 00:29:01,490
So anyone famous here?

548
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:03,859
I mean, besides me.

549
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:14,170
You there. you're one of blair's
new minions, aren't you?

550
00:29:14,237 --> 00:29:16,638
You're chuck bass.
blair said you weren't coming.

551
00:29:16,706 --> 00:29:18,941
My dinner canceled.
the emir had to fly home--

552
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:21,610
Something about a revolution.
where is she?

553
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:26,248
Probably getting ready
for her toast.
keep up, bambi.
blair's not giving the toast.

554
00:29:26,316 --> 00:29:28,850
Uh, yes, she is.
mr. ellis promised if--

555
00:29:28,918 --> 00:29:31,687
Promised what?

556
00:29:45,302 --> 00:29:46,668
Nate.

557
00:29:46,736 --> 00:29:50,106
Hey. what are you doing here?
serena.

558
00:29:50,173 --> 00:29:53,142
I heard you talking
to your grandfather.

559
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,544
Why would you leak
a fake photo?

560
00:29:55,612 --> 00:29:58,114
Are you trying to destroy
tripp's campaign?

561
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:00,949
No. that's gonna win tripp
the election.

562
00:30:01,017 --> 00:30:04,686
What are you talking about?
once the buckleys leak it,
we'll release the real photo.

563
00:30:04,754 --> 00:30:06,622
It's gonna look like

564
00:30:06,689 --> 00:30:08,624
The buckleys planted
the fake one.

565
00:30:08,691 --> 00:30:10,892
People are finally gonna
see them

566
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,130
As the villains
they really are.
and what happens to carter?
you--you just used him?

567
00:30:14,197 --> 00:30:16,398
Come on, serena.
he proposed to p.j.'s sister

568
00:30:16,466 --> 00:30:18,467
To pay off his gambling debt.

569
00:30:18,535 --> 00:30:21,003
Wake up.
the guy's hardly innocent.

570
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,839
(sighs) but i am sorry
i had to lie to you.

571
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,941
No, you're not,
but you will be.

572
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,348
Manhattan, new york.
p.j. buckley.

573
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:39,087
No, i'm doing
the mother teresa movie.

574
00:30:39,156 --> 00:30:41,857
Yes. yeah, leo's playing
my boyfriend.

575
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:43,859
I'm sure she'll be
just a second.

576
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:46,094
Well, let's just meet
at your pad in the bu.

577
00:30:46,163 --> 00:30:49,165
The bu--the bu is malibu.

578
00:30:49,232 --> 00:30:52,067
Oh, yes.
you know what?
just give us a moment, please.

579
00:30:52,135 --> 00:30:55,271
Uh-huh. oh! wait.
i-i gotta go.

580
00:30:55,338 --> 00:30:58,106
I love you, too, bitch.
what--what are you doing?

581
00:30:58,175 --> 00:31:01,109
What do you mean?
you're referring to the bu,
you're calling your astrologer.

582
00:31:01,178 --> 00:31:04,046
Since when do you even have
an astrologer?
i guess ever since

583
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:06,248
I became another shallow
hollywood celebrity,

584
00:31:06,316 --> 00:31:08,417
You know, the kind
that you are so afraid

585
00:31:08,485 --> 00:31:11,353
Your parents
wouldn't approve of?
what are you talking about?

586
00:31:11,421 --> 00:31:15,123
Vanessa told me
that's why you disinvited me.

587
00:31:15,192 --> 00:31:18,160
Vanessa? i-i blew this dinner
off because vanessa told me

588
00:31:18,228 --> 00:31:20,629
That you were freaking out
about meeting my parents.

589
00:31:20,697 --> 00:31:24,200
What? i never said that.

590
00:31:24,267 --> 00:31:27,236
Oh, my god.

591
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:30,439
The lips, the teeth,
the tip of the tongue.

592
00:31:30,507 --> 00:31:34,176
The lips, the teeth, the tip...
(smacks lips) of the tongue.

593
00:31:34,244 --> 00:31:37,213
Please tell me you're not coming
here to grovel.

594
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,082
You really think you're
that much better than me?

595
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:42,784
Oh, i think we both know
the answer to that. (scoffs)
blair, i have to talk to you.

596
00:31:42,852 --> 00:31:44,587
Not now.
just listen. i--

597
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:47,323
Quiet! god, i've had
just about enough of you.

598
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,258
Sophie,
you're minion number one.

599
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:51,093
Amalia, you're number two.

600
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,263
<i>so tell me once and for all,
what makes you better than me?</i>

601
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:58,400
Do you really want to know?
yeah.

602
00:31:58,468 --> 00:31:59,835
Everything.

603
00:31:59,902 --> 00:32:01,870
Generations of breeding
and wealth

604
00:32:01,938 --> 00:32:03,872
Had to come together
to produce me.

605
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,343
I have more in common with
marie antoinette than with you.

606
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:10,312
<i>and granted, you may be popular</i>

607
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,549
<i>at some step-ivy safety school,
but the fact is,</i>

608
00:32:13,617 --> 00:32:16,418
The rabble is still rabble,
amd they need a queen.
you stole the toast.

609
00:32:16,486 --> 00:32:19,255
I was willing to do what
was necessary,

610
00:32:19,322 --> 00:32:20,856
<i>including lying to chuck,</i>

611
00:32:20,923 --> 00:32:23,191
<i>the one person who trusts me
more than anyone.</i>

612
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,094
Now if you'll excuse me,
i have to give my toast.

613
00:32:26,162 --> 00:32:28,163
Actually, blair...

614
00:32:28,231 --> 00:32:30,299
Congratulations.
you just did.

615
00:32:49,753 --> 00:32:51,253
Oh, no.

616
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,428
<i>oh, no.
sorry, ladies.</i>

617
00:32:59,496 --> 00:33:01,229
Le jeux sont fait.

618
00:33:01,298 --> 00:33:03,165
<i>thanks for playing...
each other.</i>

619
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:07,570
I know i shouldn't have lied.
it's just when mr. ellis

620
00:33:07,637 --> 00:33:10,606
Asked olivia to give the toast
instead of me-- wait.
you were the other girl?

621
00:33:10,674 --> 00:33:13,308
Wait a second, you were
supposed to give the toast?

622
00:33:13,377 --> 00:33:16,645
Why didn't you tell me?
i wanted to surprise you with
this nice toast about being here

623
00:33:16,713 --> 00:33:21,116
With your parents,
and--and then you disinvited me.
well, i did that
because you lied to me.

624
00:33:21,184 --> 00:33:24,787
Why couldn't you just tell me
you wanted to give the toast?

625
00:33:24,855 --> 00:33:27,956
I mean, i would have
given it to you.
i know. i let blair convince me
if i asked, you'd say no.

626
00:33:28,024 --> 00:33:30,459
When i called and asked
why dan didn't want me

627
00:33:30,527 --> 00:33:33,562
To meet his family, you said
it's because they looked down

628
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:36,131
On hollywood people like--
and they probably do now,
you know.

629
00:33:36,199 --> 00:33:39,435
I mean, you were--
you were pretty annoying.
i am so sorry.
i substituted my awful family

630
00:33:39,503 --> 00:33:43,338
For his amazing one.
i love rufus and lily,

631
00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:46,542
And i wish they were
my parents.
vanessa?

632
00:33:51,815 --> 00:33:54,884
I just want
to wish you luck.

633
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:57,286
Mom.

634
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:03,793
Chuck?

635
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,929
Chuck is gone.

636
00:34:06,996 --> 00:34:10,232
But i need to talk to him.
i need to explain.

637
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,735
Blair, whatever
you needed him to do,

638
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:15,471
Do you really think
he would have refused you?

639
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:16,605
No.

640
00:34:18,442 --> 00:34:21,376
He'd never say no...
to anything.

641
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:24,914
I messed up, didn't i?

642
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:27,516
Yes. yes, you really did.

643
00:34:27,584 --> 00:34:29,518
Lily,
you're supposed to say,

644
00:34:29,586 --> 00:34:31,520
"everything is
going to be fine."

645
00:34:31,588 --> 00:34:35,023
Where did you learn how to give
a pep talk--guantanamo?

646
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:38,527
Blair, i understand a thing
or two about ambitious women,

647
00:34:38,595 --> 00:34:40,729
But without trust,
you're lost.

648
00:34:40,797 --> 00:34:42,865
Let chuck lick his wounds.

649
00:34:42,933 --> 00:34:44,900
You can talk to him
tomorrow.

650
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:57,813
(carter) serena.

651
00:34:57,881 --> 00:35:01,316
You came.

652
00:35:01,384 --> 00:35:03,151
Mmm.

653
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:06,088
I'm sorry for all the things
that i said to you

654
00:35:06,155 --> 00:35:07,690
At the wedding.

655
00:35:07,757 --> 00:35:10,325
I deserved them. um, look,
serena, i'm leaving tomorrow.

656
00:35:10,393 --> 00:35:11,894
No, you're not.

657
00:35:11,962 --> 00:35:13,929
I settled your debt
with the buckleys.

658
00:35:13,997 --> 00:35:16,431
What?

659
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,200
How?

660
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:20,402
It's a long story, but...

661
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:24,807
I helped p.j. avoid
a very public fiasco.

662
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:27,510
Nate probably hates me now,
but it doesn't matter.

663
00:35:27,577 --> 00:35:29,778
You can stay.

664
00:35:29,846 --> 00:35:32,848
I didn't ask
for you to save me.
i wanted to.

665
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:35,584
Serena, this was my debt
to settle, not yours.

666
00:35:35,652 --> 00:35:38,487
If that means
i have to go work on--
work on an oil rig?

667
00:35:38,555 --> 00:35:40,856
Carter, i wasn't gonna allow
that to happen.

668
00:35:40,924 --> 00:35:43,559
You have nothing to prove
to the buckleys.

669
00:35:43,627 --> 00:35:45,694
I wasn't proving it to them.

670
00:35:45,762 --> 00:35:47,897
I was   proving it to you,
to myself.

671
00:35:47,964 --> 00:35:50,432
<i>i wanted to take responsibility
for what i did.</i>

672
00:35:53,169 --> 00:35:54,670
I have to go.

673
00:35:54,738 --> 00:35:57,339
No.

674
00:35:57,407 --> 00:36:00,643
I saw the way you looked at me
at the wedding,

675
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:03,812
And i see the way
that you're looking at me now.

676
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,248
I think i'd rather...
have you hate me

677
00:36:06,315 --> 00:36:08,250
Than feel sorry for me.

678
00:36:08,317 --> 00:36:10,085
(voice breaks) please.

679
00:36:18,127 --> 00:36:19,494
Mom.

680
00:36:19,563 --> 00:36:21,697
Please.

681
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:23,832
(voice breaks) i'm so sorry.

682
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,902
Vanessa,
we are so hard on you

683
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:30,172
Because we want you to challenge
yourself to be your own person.

684
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:33,542
Are we really wrong
to--to question your decision

685
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,210
To attend college here?

686
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:38,681
I think it's time

687
00:36:38,748 --> 00:36:42,284
For you to consider who
this place is turning you into.

688
00:36:53,229 --> 00:36:55,497
Your parents hate me.
i hate me.

689
00:36:55,565 --> 00:36:58,100
We'll just explain what
happened. you'll be fine.

690
00:36:58,167 --> 00:37:00,335
Maybe she's different
when they're alone.
ahem.

691
00:37:00,403 --> 00:37:02,337
Maybe
she's totally different.
ahem.

692
00:37:02,405 --> 00:37:06,208
(rufus) oh, hey. (chuckles)
we missed you guys.
yes, very much.

693
00:37:06,275 --> 00:37:09,712
(under breath) oh, god.
dan,
was that blair on the p.a.?

694
00:37:09,779 --> 00:37:11,513
She really should have run
that speech past someone.
uh, yeah, you know, i'll--
i'll--i'll get to that,

695
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:13,849
But, uh, before,
when olivia was,

696
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:17,853
I don't know, i guess she was
being all hollywood--
oh, what?

697
00:37:17,921 --> 00:37:21,090
I don't know
what you're talking about.
oh, my god. i have to explain.
i'm so sorry.

698
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:23,158
(josh) ladies and gentlemen,

699
00:37:23,226 --> 00:37:25,193
It's time
for this year's freshman toast,

700
00:37:25,261 --> 00:37:28,363
And it's my honor
to call upon olivia burke.

701
00:37:28,431 --> 00:37:30,599
What?

702
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:33,568
(chuckles nervously)
i was not expecting this.

703
00:37:33,637 --> 00:37:37,339
Olivia, can i get a picture?
me, too.

704
00:37:37,406 --> 00:37:39,675
(olivia) oh, sure. um...

705
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:51,603
<i>nice try, ladies.</i>

706
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,600
<i>you came out swinging
but never stood a chance</i>

707
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,400
<i>against
a hollywood heavyweight.</i>

708
00:37:56,435 --> 00:37:57,292
Why did we do all this?

709
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,281
(amplified voice)

710
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:09,084

has got to end,

711
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,338
It'll be fine this time.

712
00:38:12,407 --> 00:38:14,274

00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:22,315
So, uh,

716
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:25,719
Um, it was just a joke
to lighten the mood.
(laughs)

717
00:38:25,787 --> 00:38:28,688
Mr. and mrs. humphrey, i'm
really sorry about yesterday.

718
00:38:28,756 --> 00:38:31,190
Dan, already explained
everything. let's talk toppings.

719
00:38:31,258 --> 00:38:33,794
We have whipped cream,
strawberries, chocolate chips.

720
00:38:33,861 --> 00:38:36,362
(jenny) and, uh,
does anyone want coffee?

721
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:37,731
Jenny, wait. um...

My "welcome back, kotter"
mugs.

723
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,871
Yes, well, it wouldn't be
our home without them.

724
00:38:44,939 --> 00:38:47,441
Olivia, you get the, uh,
vinnie barbarino.

725
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:50,343
You know, travolta has,
uh, a set of these.

726
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,212
He got really upset
when i accidentally cracked

727
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,182
His freddie "boom-boom"
washington.

728
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,718
I'm just kidding.
(laughs) hey, let's eat.

729
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:02,722
Oh, you weren't kidding,
were you?

730
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,491
No.

731
00:39:09,664 --> 00:39:12,365
What do you want, blair?

732
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,201
Forgiveness.

733
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,270
(whispers)
i'm so sorry, chuck.

734
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:20,139
(normal voice)
i made a mistake.

735
00:39:20,207 --> 00:39:23,710
I know there's no excuse,
but... it was just a kiss.

736
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:31,150
The people you manipulate--

737
00:39:31,218 --> 00:39:35,254
I know how little respect
you have for them.

738
00:39:35,322 --> 00:39:38,992
But not you. i don't feel
that way about you.

739
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:42,061
And i won't ever do it again.
i promise.

740
00:39:44,899 --> 00:39:47,400
(whispers) it was a mistake.
i'm in a meeting.

741
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,235
Call you later?

742
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:13,359

744
00:40:16,397 --> 00:40:19,465
