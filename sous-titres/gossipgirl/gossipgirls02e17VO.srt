Gossip Girl

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,510
here... your one and only source

3
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,280
into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,840
This is my boyfriend Dan Humphrey.

5
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,360
Hi. Dan, this is Miss Carr. 

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,560
She's my favorite new teacher.

7
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,070
What are you doing here? 

8
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,400
I'm taking your advice to come out to Brooklyn sometime.

9
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,410
Why would you turn down Yale? 

10
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,880
Yeah. Why... why would you do that?

11
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,600
Brown is just a better fit for me, Dan. 

12
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:18,870
Do we still fit?

13
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,060
This is a "B." Second semester seniors get a free pass.

14
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,410
You want to get Rachel back for the grade she gave you? 

15
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,770
I can't risk not getting into Yale.

16
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,550
I just wanted to teach you a lesson. 

17
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,770
Inviting me to a closed restaurant for dinner?

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,750
Ms. Carr told me what you did.

19
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,840
If you complete detention to my satisfaction,

20
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,740
Yale will still be possible.

21
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,400
- Is it war?  - Yes...

22
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,480
But this one will be different.

23
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,180
And who am I?

24
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,570
That's a secret I'll never tell.

25
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,260
You know you love me.

26
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,140
X.O.X.O. Gossip Girl.

27
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,230
While upper east siders are hitting the snooze button,

28
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,430
Blair Waldorf had a rude awakening

29
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,960
When the rooster crowed at dawn this morning.

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,160
Never...

31
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,360
In my 16,982 hours of schooling

32
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,060
have I ever been sentenced to detention.

33
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,130
I can't believe you added up all the hours of class we've had.

34
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,130
- Makes me wanna play hooky.  - One month with Ms. Carr,

35
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,160
and I'm serving a week of hard time.

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,130
Dorota! Hey, be more thorough!

37
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,300
Well, I think you might've

38
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,300
had a little something to do with that.

39
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,760
The opera? The boathouse? Ring a bell?

40
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,660
Look, all I know is

41
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,400
I've never had a teacher who's actually taken me seriously.

42
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,160
It feels like she really gets me. Is... is that weird?

43
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,160
Looks like Humphrey has some competition.

44
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,260
Well, Dan and I have barely spoken all week.

45
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,830
They say conversation is the first thing to go.

46
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,300
We will talk. There's just a lot going on right now.

47
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,700
Look, B., I gotta go.

48
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,700
I know where Rachel eats breakfast,

49
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,360
and I have to drop off my extra credit essay

50
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,600
before I go to school. I'll see you there.

51
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,030
Serena's sympathetic to the enemy.

52
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,660
I have to cross her off my list of recruits.

53
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,830
Give me that, quick! Come on! Quick!

54
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,360
Daddy!

55
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,030
What a nice surprise!

56
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,200
Handsome and I thought we'd bring you some breakfast.

57
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,360
Thank you.

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,660
You know, Blair bear, I'm proud of you.

59
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,560
You're handling your punishment with such grace.

60
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,330
Well, we Waldorfs are nothing if not graceful.

61
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,800
I wish you'd let me speak to the school.

62
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,800
It sounds like this teacher's been after you from the start.

63
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,700
Thank you.  

64
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,600
But I wanted to handle this on my own.

65
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,940
That speaks volumes

66
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,120
of the mature young lady you've become.

67
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,090
I wish everyone could see me through your eyes.

68
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:41,890
You keep your chin up.

69
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,600
I'll see you after school.

70
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,230
Bye-bye.

71
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,100
Miss Blair, your martyr act...

72
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,700
No good.

73
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,200
Pick up the pace, shall we?

74
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,430
I have to say, Dan, I like this story

75
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,160
even more than the last one you showed me.

76
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,760
I can totally relate to the sense of isolation,

77
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,260
feeling like an outsider.

78
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,560
An outsider? You?

79
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Well, you know what? It took me ten years to master

80
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,600
the local-express-local switchback.

81
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,030
And this morning? Gotta say you rose the subway like a native.

82
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,650
Do any other Constance St. Jude's students

83
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,790
ever take the subway? 

84
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,110
Uh, no. Most of them have limos with drivers.

85
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,140
And overbearing parents, overbooked schedules... 

86
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,210
And overflowing bank accounts.

87
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,900
And a distracting sense of self-absorption.

88
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,260
School is the last thing on their minds,

89
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,730
Which is why I've been talking to headmistress Queller

90
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,800
about some ideas I have.

91
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,200
Rachel. Dan.

92
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,630
Hi, Serena.

93
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,460
You guys are... hanging out?

94
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Yeah, well, Rachel has been giving me, uh,

95
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,540
some feedback on my stories. 

96
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,750
And by "feedback," he means "a wall of praise."

97
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,600
- Dan is a really good writer.  - Trust me, I know.

98
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,630
Okay, all right, now I gotta go.

99
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,260
So... See you at school.

100
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,130
Is that your "King Lear" essay?

101
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,500
Dan has this amazing Cordelia reference

102
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,900
in one of his stories.

103
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,900
Oh, um, I was wondering,

104
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,860
- Can I have a little bit more time?  - Uh, sure.

105
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,360
Hey. Nathaniel, did we speak last night?

106
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,060
No. Why? What's up?

107
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,060
I'm not sure, but I think last night

108
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,630
- May have been the greatest night of my life.  - Really?

109
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,630
What are you doing right now?

110
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,630
I'm waiting for Vanessa. Why?

111
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,500
Write down this address.

112
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,960
Blair.

113
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,880
If I'm correct, you completed your detention this morning. 

114
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,910
Yes, Ms. Carr.

115
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,960
Signed and dated by the preservation society.

116
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,400
I hope the experience was educational.

117
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,900
I made friends with a family of squirrels

118
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,030
And had lots of time to think.

119
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,230
Oh. Henry David Thoreau found nature inspiring as well.

120
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,400
I'll see you in class.

121
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,930
Girls, now that my days of community service are behind me,

122
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,960
Time for a takedown.

123
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,700
Hello?

124
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,400
Do you need a refresher?

125
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,400
I say. You do.

126
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,900
To be honest, Blair,

127
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,230
None of us are that into 5:00 a.m. Trash duty.

128
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,260
I think we're gonna sit this one out.

129
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,030
Excuse me?

130
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,960
B., why are you doing this? Queller will tell Yale

131
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,140
You're finished with detention, and it's over. 

132
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,120
This is madness.

133
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,260
No!

134
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,800
This is Constance!

135
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,860
Don't you see?

136
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,860
If Cornflower Mary can come in here

137
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,360
And tell us how to run things,

138
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,110
Then everything we've stood for,

139
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,360
for all these years, is nothing.

140
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,730
This isn't about Yale.

141
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,330
This is about our legacy.

142
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,560
What we do here today echoes through eternity.

143
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,400
Who's with me?

144
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,400
Sorry, B. This is your vendetta.

145
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,300
Students!

146
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,230
Pay attention!  What is this?

147
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,000
New school policy... there will be no cell phone usage

148
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,800
During school hours.

149
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,930
Quiet, please.

150
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,930
Every morning before you enter the building,

151
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,760
You will check your phones.

152
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,170
Is this a joke? 

153
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,570
I feel nauseous.

154
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,530
Somebody pinch me. I'm in my own worst nightmare.

155
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,830
Who could be behind such pure evil?

156
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,800
Well, well, well.

157
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,460
Now you with me?

158
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,700
What do you want us to do?

159
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,360
Every great leader knows

160
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,900
You don't send your girls into the field unarmed.

161
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,200
If we know Blair Waldorf,

162
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,320
munitions are on their way.

163
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,100
She's been like this for the past hour.

164
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,760
I think it's withdrawal.

165
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,760
She hasn't checked "gossip girl" in an hour and a half.

166
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,950
Is... is a scandal still a scandal 

167
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,300
If you... you can't text about it?

168
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,760
That's very zen.

169
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,460
Did anyone see you? 

170
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,550
No, Miss Blair.

171
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,230
And you have what I asked for?

172
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,260
Thank you, Jesus.

173
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,930
No. Thank you, Blair.

174
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,200
And thank you, Dorota.

175
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,960
Please, I-I need to check the dow.

176
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,030
Hey!

177
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,430
Nelly Yuki, get a grip!

178
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,300
Girls...

179
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,300
These phones are our ammo.

180
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,460
I want you to dig deep... and I mean deep...

181
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,760
into Rachel's past.

182
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,760
We're gonna run that commie cornhusker

183
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,460
Straight out of Constance.

184
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,160
Please tell me what we're doing here.

185
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,160
Yeah, and talk about the filthy rich...

186
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,150
W-what happened to you? 

187
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,270
Yesterday, I received an envelope.

188
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,160
Inside was a business card

189
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,530
With an address, a date and a time on it.

190
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,860
No name.

191
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,360
I assumed it was

192
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,360
Some overly designed invitation to a business meeting.

193
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,360
When I arrived at the address,

194
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
it was something different entirely.

195
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,080
A high-stakes poker game?  

196
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,590
Or an arms dealer auction?

197
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,560
The ultimate private gentleman's club.

198
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,100
I walked through this door, and it was...

199
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,160
The Chuck Bass version of Narnia?

200
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,900
She was the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

201
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,600
It's like she was waiting for me...

202
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,200
Ready to serve...

203
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,760
Knowing my every desire...

204
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,200
Okay, we don't need details.

205
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,730
Sadly, I'm pretty sure that's as far as it went.

206
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,960
I woke up alone in a hotel room,

207
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,510
and a cruel twist of face,

208
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,730
I don't even remember her name.

209
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,460
Well, what exactly do you remember?

210
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,030
Not a lot.

211
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,360
I'm hoping coming here will change that.

212
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,430
Between milking cows in Des Moines

213
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,240
and teaching low income kids to read and write,

214
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,840
Ms. Carr is clean as a whistle. 

215
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,210
Seriously, she's the Midwestern Mother Theresa.

216
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,740
Impossible, Hazel.

217
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:51,270
Your methods of inquiry must be as tired as your hair.

218
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,180
We searched everywhere.

219
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,220
My fingers aren't raw.

220
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,610
When the truth fails you,

221
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,680
you have no choice but to abandon it.

222
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,370
Make something up...

223
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:04,890
idiots.

224
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,290
With friends like these, who needs friends?

225
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,330
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.  - Are you okay?

226
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,760
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

227
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:20,750
It's just a file folder. 

228
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,570
It's not a brick wall.

229
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,520
I meant before that. 

230
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,470
You didn't even notice me

231
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,740
until you nearly knocked me over. 

232
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,710
No, no, no. No, I-I noticed you.

233
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,260
Uh, I was just actually thinking how much I like your sweater.

234
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,040
Thanks.

235
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,830
Not that I didn't like what you were wearing yesterday

236
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,330
or that I even remember... A-a yellow sweater

237
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,960
- and, uh, those shoe boot things.  - Dan?

238
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,960
- Yeah.  - Breathe.

239
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,430
Right. Oxygen... it's good for the brain.

240
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,760
Uh, yeah, I...

241
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,830
Ladies, you can give your tiny brains a rest.

242
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,930
Once again, the world has proven anything you can do,

243
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,530
I can do better.

244
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,560
- Sorry about that.  - It's okay.

245
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,130
- I'm sure you're on your way to class or...  - It's... no, I'm just...

246
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,400
- Ms. Carr and Dan Humphrey?  - Are they really?

247
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,200
Who cares? But I have a friend in cyberspace

248
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,760
who'll know just what to do.

249
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,900
X.O.X.O.

250
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,560
Oh, good job, man.

251
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,100
Way to go.

252
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,300
- What?  - Yeah, dude.

253
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,860
Hey, this day is getting weirder by the minute.

254
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,960
Anything you want to tell me?

255
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,460
Uh, besides I'm glad

256
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,730
you're not wearing that raccoon makeup anymore?

257
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,600
'Cause you looked like one of the incredibles.

258
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,200
Oh, thanks a lot.

259
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,230
And I thought I was the bad seed in the family.

260
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,700
What? Wha... all right, what's going on?

261
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,990
"Is... is lonely boy giving a certain new teacher

262
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,520
more than just an apple?" What does that mean,

263
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,090
and... and why is it written on your hand?

264
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,930
'Cause Nelly Yuki wouldn't give me her contraband phone

265
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,680
to show you myself. 

266
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,330
I mean, this is just the headline.

267
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,830
The whole post would've gone all the way up my arm.

268
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,360
It was quite detailed about you and Ms. Carr

269
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,650
and your forbidden love. 

270
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,490
M-me and Ms. Carr?

271
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,260
- Mm-hmm.  - What? No. That's absurd. That is absurd.

272
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,030
Well, I'm not the one you need to convince.

273
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,310
I will see you later.

274
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,260
Dan, tell me this is not true. 

275
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,550
Do you really need to ask?

276
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,610
If there's something you need to say, then say it now.

277
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,480
No, there's not. 

278
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,330
There's not, I swear.

279
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,950
I have no idea who sent that text or why.

280
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,690
Okay.

281
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,630
I'm sorry I doubted you.

282
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,640
Just... things were so weird between us this morning,

283
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,800
and then this... I-I don't know.

284
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,180
I-I guess I was just confused. 

285
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,430
Yeah, I'm right there with you.

286
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,100
Who... why would someone want to do this?

287
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,940
I mean, I thought everyone loved Rachel.

288
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,050
Well, I do know someone who's not exactly her biggest fan.

289
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,510
Blair got trash duty in central park because of her.

290
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,410
If Blair did this to Rachel, this...

291
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,650
I mean, she's gone way too far.

292
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,400
So the ultimate gentlemen's club was here?

293
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,900
Because this place reminds me of my aunt's house.

294
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,030
This was the place. I knew it.

295
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:37,300
There were velvet curtains blocking this hallway.

296
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,530
There were women wearing masks,

297
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,060
lying on a divan right where this piano is.

298
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,780
All right, listen, maybe you should get some rest.

299
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,540
It could help jog your memory.

300
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,200
Or warm ginger ale.

301
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,840
It's a miracle hangover cure.

302
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,880
This is her. This is the woman.

303
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,170
Let me see.

304
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,640
No way. The mom? This must be her house.

305
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,940
Well, there's only one way to find out.

306
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,700
The ladies' room?

307
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,030
I knew you and Serena were having problems.

308
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,600
I had no clue they were anatomical.

309
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,230
The only reason I'm trespassing on sacred ground

310
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,230
is because I know you sent that rumor to "Gossip Girl".

311
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,990
Sorry. No idea what you're talking about. 

312
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,080
You can go now.

313
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,390
Whatever issues you have with Rachel,

314
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,980
she cares about people. 

315
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,890
She cares about her job.

316
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,280
Oh... That is so sweet.

317
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,040
Maybe you should write a short story about it

318
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,600
and have Rachel give you notes... Naked.

319
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,230
I'm just... All right,

320
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,090
okay. All right.

321
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,860
Hey.

322
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm... I'm sorry I didn't give this to you earlier.

323
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,660
I know it's silly, but the reason is, um,

324
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,860
well, Dan...

325
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,230
He's so confident in his writing that I...

326
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,660
I don't know. I was just a little intimidated.

327
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:17,790
Dan's talented,

328
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,110
but his confidence comes

329
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,370
from a lifetime of encouragement and praise.

330
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,920
I'm guessing, for you, birthdays rarely meant new pens

331
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,400
and a notebook to fill with your ideas.

332
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,360
Yeah, more like a Chanel wallet and a credit card

333
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,350
to get me out of the house.

334
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,020
Thank you.

335
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,060
It's like I have spinach in my teeth or something.

336
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,290
And I don't. I even went to the bathroom to check.

337
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,490
Mm-hmm, yeah, it's actually not spinach.

338
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,150
Um, it's a rumor...

339
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,950
a pretty ugly one about you and Dan.

340
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,210
But I... I know it's not true. 

341
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,230
A rumor about me and Dan.

342
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,410
I've been at this school long enough

343
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,250
to know what that means. 

344
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,130
Unbelievable. 

345
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,510
Yeah, well, don't worry.

346
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,990
I've been on "Gossip Girl" plenty of times,

347
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,260
and for the worst things.

348
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,650
Some of them were true, some of them weren't.

349
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,220
But eventually, everyone forgets.

350
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,390
The best thing to do with these things

351
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,970
is just nothing at all. 

352
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,290
"Gossip Girl"?

353
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,660
Oh, yeah, it's, um, it's a web site

354
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,470
where a girl posts gossip.

355
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,370
Well, at least we think it's a girl.

356
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,600
And where does she get her tips?

357
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,490
Um, it's anonymous, so no one really knows.

358
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,500
But I gotta get to class.

359
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,360
Hey, Rachel.

360
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,540
You got a minute?

361
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,250
Yeah.

362
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,900
It is a great piece of property.

363
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,640
I'm surprised anyone would want to sell.

364
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,730
The husband finally caved, agreed to a Greenwich commute.

365
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
Husband.

366
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,600
The woman with the baby in the picture...

367
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,600
- I just assumed...  - The nanny.

368
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,100
I thought prospective buyers would like that photo.

369
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,730
The nanny. Of course.

370
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,830
Look, there's some, uh, questions

371
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,360
I'd like to ask the owners.

372
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,200
Nothing serious.

373
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,200
Noise, neighbors, that sort of thing.

374
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,200
I'll do my best to answer them,

375
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,530
But I can't give out a client's personal information.

376
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,200
It's policy.

377
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,700
Of course. I understand.

378
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,460
But I'm sure you know what the Bass name means

379
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,930
in real estate.

380
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,930
If you were to help me, maybe you'd allow me

381
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,630
to extend the same professional courtesy to you in the future?

382
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,500
Well, I could never do anything unprofessional.

383
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,860
But sometimes I do leave a file unattended

384
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,860
when I go to get a drink.

385
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,330
There's some bottled water in the fridge.

386
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,660
Are you thirsty?

387
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,830
Parched.

388
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,000
Hello?

389
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,030
- Yes, is this the Philips residence?  - Yes.

390
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,030
I... I hope I'm not disturbing you.

391
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,030
I was wondering if I could speak with your nanny, please.

392
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,530
I'm sorry.

393
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,530
Elle's with the children at the park.

394
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,830
- Can I take a message?  - Elle. We met last night in Manhattan.

395
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,860
I just wanted to thank her for a lovely evening.

396
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,500
That's impossible. Elle was here in Greenwich last night

397
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,030
watching the children.

398
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,760
- You're sure?  - Absolutely.

399
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,360
Could... could I leave a message, please?

400
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,860
Can you tell her Chuck Bass called?

401
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,430
My number is 646...

402
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,330
I was told you wanted to see me, headmistress Queller?

403
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,560
Miss Waldorf, please have a seat.

404
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,730
This school has been aware of the "Gossip Girl" web site

405
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,230
for some time.

406
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,430
The students haven't complained, so we've turned a blind eye.

407
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:43,130
However, now that a teacher has become involved,

408
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,960
I have no choice but to deal with it.

409
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,360
I'm sorry. I have no idea what you're talking about.

410
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,700
Blair.

411
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,260
I know you posted the rumor about me.

412
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,560
Whatever rumor you're talking about,

413
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,960
I had nothing to do with it.

414
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,360
I find this accusation preposterous.

415
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,300
Ms. Temmel, would you please send the student in? Thank you.

416
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,300
Someone came forward and identified you

417
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,730
as the source. Let me guess... Dan Humphrey?

418
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,230
This information was then confirmed by a witness.

419
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,600
If I don't go Ivy League, my dad will kill me.

420
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,030
It was my record or yours.

421
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,570
We tried to tell you something like this would happen,

422
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,570
But you just wouldn't listen. 

423
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,250
I'm sorry, Blair.

424
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,090
Blair, your actions threatened the reputation

425
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,220
Of the entire teaching staff and this school.

426
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,080
You give me no choice but to ask you

427
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,950
To leave Constance Billard.

428
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:37,990
You're expelling me?

429
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,460
Headmistress Queller is standing firm on the expulsion.

430
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,460
Yale will revoke my acceptance

431
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,660
As soon as they receive word.

432
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,030
This is my darkest hour.

433
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,700
Blair, if you started that rumor

434
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,030
About Dan Humphrey and the teacher,

435
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,660
She has a legitimate case for slander.

436
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,660
I need to know.

437
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,160
Did you?

438
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,200
I might've posted something on "Gossip Girl."

439
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,060
All the girls do it.

440
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,400
It's how we communicate.

441
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:23,800
But anything I wrote was the truth.

442
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,160
I didn't lie.

443
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,930
I promise, Daddy.

444
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,530
All right. Then you should've been honest

445
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,560
With the Headmistress about that.

446
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,260
But the real issue here is not teenagers gossiping online.

447
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,860
It's not?

448
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,860
No, it's that a teacher is having

449
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,610
An inappropriate relationship with a student.

450
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,600
I'm going to contact my lawyers. 

451
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,160
We're gonna fight this.

452
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,530
Fight it? Oh, I don't...

453
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,300
You will not be punished for telling the truth.

454
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,200
Thank you, Daddy.

455
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,640
So you ratted on Blair? You Templeton.

456
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,100
A "Charlotte's Web"-sult? 

457
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:03,940
That's very cute.

458
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:04,990
And, no, technically,

459
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,150
I did not rat on Blair.

460
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,160
I just told Rachel to put the squeeze

461
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,530
On the weakest of her kilted cronies. 

462
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,760
And what does Serena think

463
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,980
Of you getting her best friend expelled? 

464
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,600
The moment Blair involves me in her schemes,

465
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,680
The "boyfriend of the b.f.f." clause

466
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,810
Is officially null and void. 

467
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
So she brought it on herself.

468
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,490
The alleged online slander incident?

469
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:23,480
What? You, um... You heard about the rumor?

470
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,410
You gave it a name? 

471
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,630
Well, the parents' council called

472
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,670
An emergency meeting tonight.

473
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,560
Apparently, my son is the object of the slander,

474
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,880
Assuming that it is slander... you and Ms. Carr.

475
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,660
A package for Vanessa Abrams.

476
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,660
Saved by the bell.

477
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,330
Dan, if I'm gonna walk into a room

478
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,800
Full of fired-up parents, I need to know.

479
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,900
Is there something we need to talk about?

480
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm gonna go file this.

481
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:51,000
No, there's... No, there's nothing to talk about.

482
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,430
My tea is getting cold.

483
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,300
Hey, thanks for meeting me.

484
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:00,660
- I brought these to keep us warm.  - Oh,thanks.

485
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,160
After everything that's gone on this week,

486
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
I feel safer meeting outside.

487
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,700
We can talk freely.

488
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,330
I swept the perimeter for bugs.

489
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,460
Ms. Carr, I... I understand that you're upset with Blair.

490
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,360
What she did was wrong.

491
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,760
But does her punishment have to be expulsion?

492
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,920
It means she'll lose Yale. 

493
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,760
Do you think this is a step I wanted to take?

494
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,470
I feel terrible,

495
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,050
But Blair posted a rumor that threatened

496
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,990
To destroy my career, my future.

497
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,600
And getting expelled destroys Blaire's future.

498
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,880
Please just talk to headmistress Queller

499
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,180
And ask her to reconsider.

500
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,240
"Gossip Girl" is just a stupid web site.

501
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,940
How can you say that, when its sole purpose is

502
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,580
To allow people to post terrible things about each other?

503
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,940
I'm not defending "Gossip Girl." 

504
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,240
I'm defending my best friend.

505
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:47,800
Believe me, Serena, I'm sorry this all happened.

506
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,660
But I have to go.

507
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,630
I have an appointment before the parents' meeting.

508
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,960
I do hope we can still be friends.

509
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,760
Hello?

510
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,200
Hey.

511
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:16,360
Hey, I-I-I really thought that Rachel would come around, but...

512
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,830
I'm sorry, B.

513
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,230
Dorota.

514
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,330
Blair? Blair?

515
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,930
Give Handsome to a homeless man.

516
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,360
Make sure he has kind eyes.

517
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,600
I'm not going to Yale.

518
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,930
I don't deserve you.

519
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,830
Okay, I'm back.

520
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,900
Just hang in there, okay?

521
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,500
We'll figure something out.

522
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,230
I can't believe we're all here on a Saturday night.

523
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,730
That's a lot of canceled restaurant reservations.

524
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,730
Well, you expel one Yale-bound senior.

525
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,930
It gets people's attention.

526
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,430
- Harold, how are you?  - Lily.

527
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,800
Mwah. I'm hoping that I can count on your support tonight.

528
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:13,200
- Blair is being horribly scapegoated.  - I thought the meeting

529
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,730
was to discuss the school's new online honor codes.

530
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,260
Yes, well, I'm crashing it to advocate for my daughter.

531
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,100
Harold Waldorf. 

532
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,590
Well, I'm here to make sure no other students

533
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,520
are slandered the way my son was by your daughter.

534
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,490
- Rufus Humphrey.  - Okay, we'll see you inside, Harold.

535
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,690
- Nathaniel.  - Hey, what's going on?

536
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,630
Now you're not still thinking about that girl, are you?

537
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,400
Her name is Elle.

538
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,080
And if you must know, I'm late for my chiropractor.

539
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,400
She's double-jointed.

540
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,930
Makes the "Kama Sutra" feel new again.

541
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,400
Nice to see you're moving on.

542
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,930
Call me tomorrow, all right?

543
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,730
I just wanted to thank you for yesterday.

544
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,230
I don't have any friends in the city.

545
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,930
And telling me about Blair. You really acted like one.

546
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,430
Oh, anytime. And, you know, if you ever need

547
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,430
a character witness to vouch for how fantastic you are,

548
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,200
uh, I'm your guy.

549
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,200
That's sweet. Thank you.

550
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,500
A character witness.

551
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,800
Do you know it may have come to that?

552
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,660
I'm sorry. I didn't...I didn't mean to upset you.

553
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,060
No, I'm sorry. I'm... overwhelmed.

554
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,400
And this rumor is just... so insulting.

555
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,900
An affair with a student? Me and you?

556
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,960
I would never do that.

557
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,830
Never? W-wow, that's... definitive.

558
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,130
Please, don't... take it personally.

559
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,160
- I mean...  - No, no.

560
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
If you were older or...

561
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,700
Not a student at the brother school.

562
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:55,130
You can call me in five years.

563
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,060
Uh, Dan...

564
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,260
- No, I'm... I'm sorry. I just...  - No, I... I...

565
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,360
I know. Um, it's...

566
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,430
not appropriate.

567
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,360
Uh, I... I'm late.

568
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,060
Spotted... lonely boy going from teacher's pet

569
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,960
to personal non grata

570
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,400
in the pitter-patter of a heart beat.

571
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
That invitation wasn't for you.

572
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,700
You were never supposed to be at that party.

573
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,560
- What do you remember?  - All I remember is you.

574
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,600
That's... Not what I was referring to.

575
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,700
I can't remember anything else.

576
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,530
Why don't you fill me in?

577
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,100
I wasn't at that party to meet you.

578
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,560
- I was there for another man.  - Who?

579
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,200
Your father.

580
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,660
My father?

581
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,400
My father is...

582
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,700
I know that... Now.

583
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,600
I took over a girl's client list.

584
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,960
I sent the invitation without realizing.

585
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,930
When you told me your name was Chuck,

586
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,160
I realized that I had the wrong Mr. Bass.

587
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,730
I had to get you out of there.

588
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,730
I... I had to make sure that you didn't remember anything

589
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,230
that you saw.

590
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,360
The drink... So you drugged me

591
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,260
and then snuck back to Connecticut?

592
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,030
What matters is that I left you at that hotel to keep you safe.

593
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,060
Safe from what?

594
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,030
Hey, look...

595
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:56,300
The whole "eyes wide shut" mystery has been fun.

596
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,300
But if my father was part of this group,

597
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:01,960
I have a right to know who they are.

598
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,530
Turn on CNN.

599
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,030
Walk down Wall Street. Go to Washington.

600
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,660
That's who they are.

601
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,960
And if they find out that I let an outsider in...

602
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,960
Lose the card, the stamp on your arm will fade,

603
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,130
and stop asking questions. Stop looking.

604
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,030
- I'll protect you.  - How?

605
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,130
Your own father was one of them,

606
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,500
and you didn't even know it.

607
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,130
Don't contact me again.

608
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,700
A courier delivered this to me this morning.

609
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,800
Do I need a password?

610
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,230
The password...

611
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,860
- is newport.  - Mm.

612
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,030
- 'Cause that's where my mom is tonight.  - Mm.

613
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,260
Turns out I can still apply to Oberlin.

614
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,360
The face, Serena.

615
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,760
Try to pretend it's not totally tragic.

616
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,700
You were right about Dan and Rachel.

617
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,100
Seriously?

618
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:11,760
I must've picked up on something.

619
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,530
We need proof.

620
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,230
You have proof? Give it to me.

621
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,260
Dan said that nothing was going on,

622
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,930
so I should probably just talk to him first.

623
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,130
And give him another opportunity to lie to you?

624
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,460
How awful.

625
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,930
I'm so sorry, S.

626
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,600
But this is the smoking gun I've been waiting for.

627
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,800
Blair.

628
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:48,200
We have to get to that meeting.

629
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,830
- Dorota!  - Yes, Miss Blair.

630
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,760
Go get my dog back!

631
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,530
Meet me at Constance ASAP. - S.

632
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,530
Come on.

633
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,200
This is a freedom of speech issue.

634
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,100
The school cannot control what our children write

635
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,160
on a public site.

636
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,960
What your daughter posted was slander.

637
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,600
- She should be held accountable.  - If slander's the issue,

638
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,600
we can seek an injunction against "gossip girl."

639
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,730
Shut the site down.

640
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,730
Shut it down?

641
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,730
Yes, and a hundred others will pop up in its place.

642
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,130
This isn't some note on the bathroom wall, Lil.

643
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,600
It's on the internet that Dan slept with a teacher.

644
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:31,400
- That's wrong.  - I agree. But should Blair lose Yale over this?

645
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,060
It's her whole future, Rufus.

646
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,500
Well, what about Dan's future?

647
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:39,160
How long is this gonna follow him?

648
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,360
- Miss Waldorf,  - This meeting is closed to students.

649
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,260
I'm sorry for the interruption.

650
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,600
But I have something I think almost everyone

651
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,960
here would want to see.

652
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,530
Headmistress, if you'd like to check your e-mail...

653
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:14,060
I believe it's called exculpatory evidence.

654
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,960
I love "damages."

655
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,130
Hey. I... I'm here. What's going on?

656
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,630
If you wanted to break up with me,

657
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,630
you could've just said so.

658
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,900
- I trusted you, and you lied to me... both of you.  - Whoa. Wh-what?

659
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:28,060
No, I saw you and Rachel in the coffee shop.

660
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,360
Well, yeah, Rachel was upset, and I-I comforted her.

661
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,500
I probably shouldn't have, because she pulled away, but...

662
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:37,030
Wait. Y-you didn't kiss her?

663
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,800
No, no, no, I didn't kiss her. Why would you think that?

664
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,860
Because it looked like...

665
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,630
Oh, god. I-I...

666
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,500
I took a photo and then I left,

667
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:49,230
because I didn't want to see anymore.

668
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,700
Wait a minute.

669
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:54,600
Oh, my god. Okay, uh, well, y-you can't show this to anyone.

670
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,600
I gave it to Blair.

671
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,660
Sh-she's in there with Queller and the parents

672
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,030
and-and Rachel, too.

673
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,260
Dad. Dad, it's not true.

674
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:16,130
Dan, you and I will talk at home.

675
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,400
They fired me.

676
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,530
I'm back in.

677
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,630
I saved myself and "gossip girl."

678
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,700
You used this photo of Rachel and me to back up a rumor

679
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,530
- that is nothing more than a vengeful lie.  - So?

680
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,600
Blair, unh-unh.

681
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,360
You say "lie." I say "eerily prophetic."

682
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,630
Blair?

683
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,630
Daddy.

684
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:48,530
I was going to congratulate you.

685
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,630
The driver will take you home.

686
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,030
I need some fresh air.

687
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:59,160
Daddy, please.

688
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,060
Look, I get why Blair went after Rachel,

689
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,660
but why... why you?

690
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,460
Well, I felt like a fool. I thought you lied to me.

691
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,330
- Well, I told you nothing was going on.  - I know.

692
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,700
So why were you so ready to believe the worst?

693
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,760
Honestly...

694
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,600
I think part of me wanted to.

695
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,400
Dan...

696
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,630
we keep trying to act like we can overcome anything.

697
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,500
Yeah, pretending that none of it mattered.

698
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,130
Our parents dating,

699
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,460
sharing a brother...

700
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,560
I mean, different colleges next year, it's...

701
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,500
Wow.

702
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,660
It's over, isn't it?

703
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,630
Well, we had to try.

704
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,500
Yeah.

705
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,560
Sometimes the only thing left to do

706
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,900
is to wrap your arms around each other one last time

707
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:10,060
and then just let go.

708
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,260
Lily told me about you and Serena. Are you okay?

709
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,260
Uh...

710
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,900
I'm... I'm okay about Serena.

711
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,900
What happened in the meeting?

712
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,900
Well, once the parents saw the photo of you and Ms. Carr,

713
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:37,660
- Her fate was pretty much sealed.  - Rachel didn't do anything.

714
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,660
No, I... I... I'm the one who screwed up.

715
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,760
Look, I believe the two of you weren't having an affair.

716
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,630
But meeting a student, one she didn't even teach,

717
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,130
off-hours, after school...

718
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,700
You voted to fire her, didn't you?

719
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,530
You just got into Yale. I was protecting your future.

720
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,100
By firing someone that didn't do anything wrong?

721
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,800
You know, you talk about these Park Avenue parents

722
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,800
who shield their kids from punishment?

723
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,330
Well, I should be punished, not her.

724
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,130
It's over, Dan. Let it go.

725
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,700
You left this at the park.

726
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:22,500
That's why I went to the coffee shop yesterday.

727
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,860
The coffee shop?

728
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,760
I'm the one that took the photo and gave it to Blair.

729
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,200
You're the only teacher

730
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,800
that's ever expressed any interest in me,

731
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:39,400
and I've completely ruined it.

732
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,260
Your essay.

733
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,000
I read it last night. It was wonderful,

734
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,160
filled with nuanced observations

735
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,830
About the world around you. 

736
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,660
There's some unexpected irony. Huh.

737
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,060
Rachel, I'm really sorry.

738
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,200
Serena...

739
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,300
I think you should go.

740
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,560
You'll frolic in the vineyards,

741
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,730
play boules with old men.

742
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,430
Roman got you a Chanel beret.

743
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,530
- Do you really have to take him with you?  - Well, how was I to know

744
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,530
when I asked your mother if we could get you a bulldog

745
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,560
that she assumed we meant a stuffed animal?

746
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,400
Blair...

747
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:31,030
I'm worried about you.

748
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:34,360
Why? I'm back at Constance. I got into Yale.

749
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,030
Everything's perfect again.

750
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,600
I saw a different side of you last night,

751
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,600
and I'm disappointed.

752
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,530
But, daddy, I was right.

753
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,530
No, you were lucky.

754
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,860
And you allowed me to defend a lie,

755
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,860
a lie that you looked me in the eyes and told.

756
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,860
Why did you do that?

757
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,630
Yale was on the line.

758
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:59,300
I have to go there,

759
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,860
like you.

760
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,630
- It's our plan.  - Sweetheart,

761
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,760
what matters most to me is not which college you go to.

762
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,530
It's what kind of a person you grow up to be.

763
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,760
Why don't I take you and Handsome to the airport?

764
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,400
Dorota can make a picnic, and we eat it in the car.

765
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:27,430
No. I think we should just say good-bye now.

766
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,930
I'll call you as soon as I land.

767
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,360
We both have a lot to think about.

768
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:47,660
They say every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

769
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,300
And once something is set in motion,

770
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,660
It can't help but build momentum.

771
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,030
Father, what were you involved in?

772
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,200
Elle?

773
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,200
No, it's Alan Philips.

774
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,700
Elle called us from Grand Central last night,

775
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:25,200
but she never got off the train in Greenwich.

776
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,200
Have you heard from her?

777
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:31,230
- Um, no. Uh, but I'll let you know if I do.  - We're very worried. I'd appreciate it.

778
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,600
Uh, what are you doing here?

779
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,060
I, uh, I came to apologize.

780
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,060
That rumor would've gone away.

781
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,600
But... but that hug was just totally stupid,

782
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,600
and... and... and wildly inappropriate,

783
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:01,330
And I don't know what came over me. 

784
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,830
# He whispered #

785
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,830
Rachel, what are you doing?

786
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,160
I don't teach at Constance anymore.

787
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,600
What about her conduct? The photograph?

788
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,600
The board of directors is concerned

789
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,900
we don't have sufficient evidence.

790
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:23,100
And Dan himself said there was nothing going on between them.

791
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:26,100
Ms. Carr could sue the school for wrongful termination,

792
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,360
And no one wants that kind of publicity.

793
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,360
- So what does this mean?  - Ms. Carr will be able to resume her duties

794
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,360
and see out the semester.

795
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,530
I know a few parents won't be happy,

796
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,530
but they have to understand it's for the greater good.

797
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,300
A scandal would hurt everyone.

798
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,800
I'm going to notify Ms. Carr right now.

799
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:46,300
I thought as head of the parents' council,

800
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:49,800
You'd like to know.

801
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:52,560
Hey, Dan, it's me.

802
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,760
I went to Rachel to apologize,

803
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,830
but I'm not sure it did any good.

804
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:01,600
I'm really sorry about everything.

805
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,430
I guess I'll just see you at school tomorrow.

806
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,430
And maybe we can forget

807
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,300
this whole Rachel thing ever happened.

808
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,360
One thing is certain on the Upper East side.

809
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,360
What goes around,

810
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,360
comes around.

811
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,360
X.O.X.O., Gossip Girl.

812
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


813
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
