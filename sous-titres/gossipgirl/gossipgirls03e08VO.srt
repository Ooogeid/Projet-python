1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:02,796
<i> Gossip girl here,
your one and only source</i>

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,004
<i>into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite.</i>

3
00:00:05,216 --> 00:00:08,052
Why settle for some club in a hotel,

4
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:09,679
when you can just buy the hotel ?

5
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:12,428
I'm worrying.
Politics is a van der bilt birthright.

6
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,722
The only thing Nate's ever voted for
is "american idol."

7
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:17,166
Tripp was the same way.
Grandfather can be

8
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:18,268
very persuasive.

9
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,113
When did Tripp decide
to run for congress ?

10
00:00:20,197 --> 00:00:23,314
{\Well, }After congressman kruger died,
a house seat opened up in manhattan.

11
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,905
I have to tell you
something.

12
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:26,817
{\(Man) oh, olivia!}Oh, my god. Are you ...
You're not...

13
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,830
"Fleur". I lied because
I care about you.

14
00:00:29,914 --> 00:00:32,406
The only person I want to kiss
here tonight is you.

15
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,158
Why would you leak a fake photo?

16
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:37,203
Are you trying to destroy Tripp's campaign ?
That's gonna win tripp the election.

17
00:00:37,286 --> 00:00:39,689
- And what happens to carter ?
- I am sorry I had to lie to you.

18
00:00:39,772 --> 00:00:42,082
No, you're not. I settled
your debt with the buckleys.

19
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,422
Nate probably hates me now,
but it doesn't matter.

20
00:00:44,505 --> 00:00:47,869
I'm sorry, S., but Chuck's hotel
needed this. Without your celebrities,

21
00:00:47,952 --> 00:00:50,258
we're buried in the city section.
Now we're front page news.

22
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,260
You got my clients photographed
at the hottest party

23
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,636
of the year. Your job is safe.
And, serena, that job

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,597
now includes publicly dating Patrick.

25
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,489
- I don't know if I'd call that work.
- Get back to me after date two.

26
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:03,468
<i>And who am i?</i>

27
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:06,014
<i>That's a secret
i'll never tell.</i>

28
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,718
<i>You know you love me.</i>

29
00:01:08,842 --> 00:01:12,365
<i>X.O.X.O., gossip girl.</i>

30
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:19,487
<i>In Manhattan,
some parties are V.I.P. only.</i>

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,142
# love is gonna hurt you... #

32
00:01:23,225 --> 00:01:25,282
<i>Others are strictly private.</i>

33
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,432
# if it's all right,
i'm gonna try and... #

34
00:01:28,515 --> 00:01:30,496
<i>But some parties are political,</i>

35
00:01:30,872 --> 00:01:32,318
<i>And those lines are drawn</i>

36
00:01:32,402 --> 00:01:35,246
<i>By the most established
of the establishment.</i>

37
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:38,154
# I can rob you if I want to #

38
00:01:38,238 --> 00:01:40,975
# I can rob you if I try #

39
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,745
# I can rob you if I need to #

40
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,506
You want to use that ?

41
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:51,788
<i>And once those lines are drawn,
they can never be crossed.</i>

42
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:54,385
A Michael Mann political thriller ?
That's good news.

43
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:56,764
<i>Wonderful news.<i/>
And my source tells me,</i>

44
00:01:56,848 --> 00:01:58,909
Michael's only considering
two actors for the lead.

45
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,745
Patrick and Ryan Phillippe.

46
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,365
{\Well, }Then he's in.
Ryan totally lost his mojo

47
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:06,250
after Reese got with Jake.
- Don't "Jake" me, Serena.

48
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,840
Your job is to get Patrick's
photo taken with politicians

49
00:02:08,923 --> 00:02:11,775
- at the Van Der Bilt election party tonight.
- But K.C., I can't.

50
00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:13,810
<i>The producers will eat it up.<i/>
Plus, it'll totally</i>

51
00:02:13,894 --> 00:02:15,968
help himget into character
for his audition next week.

52
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:19,030
- So I look forward to hearing how it goes.
- Wait, K.C., the problem is I'm...

53
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:23,154
I'm kind of on the outs with
the Van Der Bilts right now.

54
00:02:23,765 --> 00:02:25,811
Serena, what's P.R. rule number one ?

55
00:02:26,837 --> 00:02:29,565
My only value
is my social network.

56
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,262
<i>But i'm afraid that network<i/></i>

57
00:02:31,345 --> 00:02:34,570
<i>is currently one Archibald short.
- Make it happen.<i/></i>

58
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,195
Clean up your mess or clean out
your desk. No, that one.

59
00:02:45,522 --> 00:02:48,086
- How long you been awake ?
- Not long.

60
00:02:50,107 --> 00:02:52,160
Remember me to send a Van Der Bilt
campaign a muffin basket.

61
00:02:52,243 --> 00:02:54,883
Vanessa's been completely my ass,
since she started shooting that documentary.

62
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,834
She was here for, like,
ten seconds yesterday,

63
00:02:56,918 --> 00:02:59,011
And I guess she's getting
amazing footage.

64
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,263
The only footage I want to see
is your jimmy fallon appearance.

65
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,520
I mean, dinner was great last night.

66
00:03:02,603 --> 00:03:04,641
I just wish we'd gotten back
in time to see it.

67
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,951
{\Yeah. }Sorry I dragged you
to that gelato shop.

68
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:11,109
I had a really bad
sugar craving.

69
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:15,084
You know what ?
I bet it's online.

70
00:03:15,523 --> 00:03:17,488
{\No. Uh, }you can't watch it like that.

71
00:03:18,134 --> 00:03:19,907
{\Th-The--}The quality's so bad, you know ?

72
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,617
I'd rather you watch it in HD.

73
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,829
Okay. When ? I'm sorry.
I'm just excited. It's been a while since

74
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:26,912
I had a girlfriend
on a late night talk show.

75
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:31,711
- {\Um, well, I'm--}I'm sure I can get a copy from K.C.
- Okay.

76
00:03:39,962 --> 00:03:41,345
{\Ho ho! }Watch out.

77
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,788
It's bathroom boy.

78
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:43,996
Clear the way.

79
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,693
{\Uh, }Good morning to you, too.

80
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,064
Welcome to my new suite.
We {\may }patent the media system

81
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,189
interactive, high-Def 3-D gaming,

82
00:03:53,273 --> 00:03:56,278
instant access to the world's
largest media library

83
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:59,884
and all in-House food,
spa services.

84
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:02,575
Just touch the button.
Blair's favorite part,

85
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,797
Real-Time
surveillance playback.

86
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:06,286
It's naughty.

87
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,389
{\Well, }It certainly is a step up
from the columbia dorms.

88
00:04:10,563 --> 00:04:12,209
Most penthouses are, Nathaniel.

89
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,466
There's two bedrooms. Feel free
to crash any time you like.

90
00:04:19,077 --> 00:04:21,736
{\Hey. }All this behind the scenes
stuff is really great.

91
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:24,056
Thanks again for letting me
film Tripp's campaign.

92
00:04:24,151 --> 00:04:25,109
{\Oh, }No problem.

93
00:04:25,788 --> 00:04:28,515
- {\Well, }You've outdone yourself.
- My pleasure, sir.

94
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:30,633
I can't think of a better way
to christen the ballroom

95
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:32,229
than with a van der bilt
victory party.

96
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:35,039
Your generosity will not
be forgotten by me or my family.

97
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:37,818
We're very much looking forward
to tonight's event. - Thanks again, chuck.

98
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,620
Even if the night ends in defeat,

99
00:04:39,704 --> 00:04:42,890
- at least we'll have a good party.
- Sweetie, don't talk like that.

100
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:45,349
This morning's polling numbers
aren't great.

101
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:47,315
We're down where we should
be up, and where we are up,

102
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:50,021
- We're barely hanging on.
- That's what makes it exciting{\, right ?}.

103
00:04:50,105 --> 00:04:52,774
- Excuse me.
- He's right, Nathaniel.

104
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:54,420
Things aren't
where they should be.

105
00:04:55,385 --> 00:04:58,187
The buckleys' dirty pool
is starting to work.

106
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:00,383
Thanks to serena,
we weren't able to expose it.

107
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,302
- {\Well, }Isn't there something we can do ?
- It's election day.

108
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,428
At this point Nathaniel, it would take
nothing short of a miracle.

109
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:19,980
{\Hey. }I was running errands,

110
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:22,455
and K.C. Asked me to drop off
your Jimmy Fallon interview.

111
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,823
Great. I guess
that means you've seen it.

112
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:27,261
Yeah.

113
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,788
You know I didn't mean what I said.

114
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,415
{\Oh, don't--}Don't worry about that.
I'm sure Dan understands.

115
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,911
He hasn't even seen it.
I don't know what to do.

116
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:38,501
I have to fix this,
and meanwhile keep him away,

117
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:41,590
from tv and the internet and strangers
with the urge to make fun of him.

118
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,800
Don't forget about Gossip Girl.

119
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,010
I have to just keep him
completely isolated.

120
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,762
{\Oh, hey.} What are you doing here ?

121
00:05:48,678 --> 00:05:50,474
Serena just,

122
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,641
came by to tell us how much
she likes Patrick.

123
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:57,106
{\Yeah. uh, }Oddly, he's my favorite part
of my job.

124
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,306
It's actually pretty fun
having a fake relationship.

125
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,569
- Talk about no pressure.
- I'm slightly relieved.

126
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,029
I heard some pretty crazy stuff
about patrick after we broke up.

127
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,757
Supposedly he went a bit messed up

128
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:08,397
after that Gus Van Sant movie
he did, nobody saw.

129
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:11,829
{\Yeah}His agents and K.C. are filtering
all the scripts that get to him.

130
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,318
So far, he's only been allowed
to read a political thriller.

131
00:06:14,402 --> 00:06:16,084
What's the worst thing
he can do, pass a bill ?

132
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,312
Listen, as much as I enjoy
my current girlfriend talking

133
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:20,890
to my ex-girlfriend about
her fake boyfriend

134
00:06:20,974 --> 00:06:23,181
who is also
my current girlfriend's ex,

135
00:06:23,265 --> 00:06:26,218
you could probably get us
a copy of that Fallon interview, right?

136
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:30,031
But first, Serena, you should probably
get to patrick's

137
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:31,913
before Fedex does
with more scripts.

138
00:06:31,997 --> 00:06:34,249
Good-Bye.
Okay. Bye.

139
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:41,436
S. I hope you're not here
looking for an apology.

140
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,528
{\No, }I was just dropping
something off to olivia.

141
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:44,515
That's right.

142
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:47,488
I momentarily forgot your job is more
important than your friends.

143
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:50,785
I have a couple minutes.
Do you want to get a latte?

144
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,910
If by "getting a latte" you mean
apologizing, then no, i don't.

145
00:06:53,994 --> 00:06:56,514
Out of respect for
our many years of friendship,

146
00:06:56,598 --> 00:06:59,120
I'm willing to let what you did slide.
- What i did?

147
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:02,091
Okay, we both made decisions
that hurt the other.

148
00:07:02,175 --> 00:07:04,140
We both feel badly.
Now let's move on.

149
00:07:06,487 --> 00:07:08,343
I actually have
to go meet chuck right now.

150
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:11,304
We've been going nonstop prepping,
for Tripp{\ Van Der Bilt}'s election party tonight.

151
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:14,058
Speaking of which, i noticed
you're not on the guest list.

152
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,592
That can only mean one thing :
Nate still hates you

153
00:07:16,676 --> 00:07:20,005
for whatever it is you did to him.
- I'd check your sources, B.

154
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:23,776
and i am going tonight, with
my handsome boyfriend, Patrick.

155
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,819
Since your boyfriend's
working the party,

156
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,453
Who are you going with,
one of your knockoffs ?

157
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,159
Since you're so interested,
i have made real friends here.

158
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,441
I just don't share
your need to brag.

159
00:07:37,316 --> 00:07:39,472
Well, i can't wait
to meet them tonight.

160
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:45,634
I need a friend. Stat.

161
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,152
I'm your friend.

162
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:50,091
Please.

163
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,740
I'm not friends
with staff.

164
00:07:57,565 --> 00:07:58,997
you need to get that?

165
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:00,855
no, it's not important.

166
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,758
<i>This is nate. Leave a message.</i>

167
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,729
I'm just saying, if this morning's polls
put you neck and neck with Sullivan,

168
00:08:06,808 --> 00:08:09,820
then there's still time, so why
not let grandfather help you?

169
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,336
Nate, I've said it before,
and I'll say it again

170
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,747
I'd rather lose fair and square
than win with a dirty campaign.

171
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,535
{\Yeah, well,}Asking grandfather for help
doesn't necessarily mean playing dirty.

172
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:22,366
So it's election day,
who are you voting for ?

173
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,183
Someone's drowning over here !
Call 9-1-1 !

174
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,030
Help !
I can't swim !

175
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,598
{\Help ! }I'm drowning !

176
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:38,475
<i>It look like tripp's prayers
have been answered</i>

177
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,805
<i>with another miracle
on the hudson.</i>

178
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:45,077
<i>Are the Van Der Bilts blessed
with good luck or good timing?</i>

179
00:08:48,156 --> 00:08:49,923
<i>You're watching New York 1</i>

180
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:51,343
<i>News all day.</i>

181
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,246
<i>Just this morning, congressional
candidate Tripp Van Der Bilt</i>

182
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,381
<i>rescued a man who was drowning
in the Hudson river.</i>

183
00:08:59,465 --> 00:09:01,745
<i>One minute i'm walking
along the pier,</i>

184
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:05,294
<i>{\and }the next thing I know I lose my balance,
and boom ! I'm in the hudson. If it wasn't</i>

185
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,548
<i>for this brave young man,
Tripp Van Der Bilt...</i>

186
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:09,172
<i>Apparently Van Der Bilt
was on his way to his ...</i>

187
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:13,562
Ten hours till the polls close. Let's seize
the day, gentlemen. Where are we with media ?

188
00:09:13,646 --> 00:09:16,264
I've locked down coverage from every
local station for the midday news.

189
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,182
Time to call Couric.
She owes me a favor.

190
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,130
Maybe she can squeeze Tripp
into the evening news.

191
00:09:20,214 --> 00:09:22,282
Excuse me, grandfather.
Can I speak with you for a moment ?

192
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:23,812
<i>Zogby has them neck and neck.</i>

193
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,103
- Rasmussen puts him up by a point.
- Tripp, that's fantastic.

194
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,902
Remember, until the polls close,
any time someone mentions

195
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,448
the name Tripp Van Der Bilt,
It should be followed by the word "hero."

196
00:09:34,786 --> 00:09:36,861
{\well,}I guess miracles do happen,

197
00:09:37,513 --> 00:09:38,851
Huh, grandfather ?

198
00:09:38,935 --> 00:09:40,624
Our family is really blessed.

199
00:09:40,722 --> 00:09:42,636
So is that man who almost died.

200
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,069
William, can you take a look at this ?

201
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,717
Absolutely. No, thank you.
Thank you so, so much.

202
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:56,011
{\Hey.} My rescue footage is gonna be
on the news tonight.

203
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,331
William told me to go out and drum up
some interest and it looks like,

204
00:09:58,415 --> 00:10:02,517
I'm the only one who got it all on tape.
- Congratulations. Have you seen Nate ?

205
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:04,713
Yeah. He's over there.
Tell him bye for me.

206
00:10:04,807 --> 00:10:07,111
I've gotta go home
and get my tapes together.{\- Okay.}

207
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,697
What are you doing here ?
I left you a message. You never called me back.

208
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,888
{\Yeah, well, }As you can see, I've been sort of busy,

209
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,494
and i really have nothing to say to you.
- Then i'll make it quick.

210
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:24,039
I need you to put me and Patrick Roberts
on the guest list for Tripp's party tonight.

211
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,334
- What ? Are you kidding me ?
- Nate, my job is at stake.

212
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,338
Oh, that's funny. So is my cousin's
campaign, thanks to you.

213
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,548
As far as i'm concerned, we're even.

214
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,008
You used me
for your buckley photo scam.

215
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,677
All I did was find out and undo it.

216
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,427
Well, I wouldn't exactly call revenge

217
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:40,519
a solid foundation for a friendship.

218
00:10:40,603 --> 00:10:44,058
Who said anything about friendship ?
All I need is an invite, plus one.

219
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,730
I voted for you.

220
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:50,128
Thanks. You coming tonight ?

221
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,070
Absolutely.
I wouldn't miss it.

222
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:55,652
Thanks, nate.

223
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:58,113
Tripp, can I get you
to sign off on this ?

224
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,537
Washington square park,
bobst library, bar none.

225
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:07,286
I even tried spinning the cube in
st. Mark's place, but not a friend in sight.

226
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,419
- I just know this wouldn't be so hard at yale.
- What about that vanessa girl?

227
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:14,340
- Didn't you know her in high school ?
- I have never heard that name before in my life.

228
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,809
Now feel free to see yourself out.

229
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:23,767
Oh, my god.

230
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,571
How does that girl have the valentino
360 bag ? I'm still wait-listed.

231
00:11:27,655 --> 00:11:29,438
- Who ? Where ?
- At the register.

232
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:34,491
- Quick. How do i look?
- Superior.

233
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:37,863
No one follow me.

234
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,702
I love your 360.

235
00:11:43,864 --> 00:11:46,831
- Thanks. I just got it.
- Very smart to pair it with peter som.

236
00:11:47,229 --> 00:11:48,124
You're good.

237
00:11:48,477 --> 00:11:51,752
I know. I'm blair. May i?

238
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,293
Oh, please. Do.

239
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,506
The moment i saw it,

240
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,299
it joined my list
of Blair's most wanted.

241
00:11:59,683 --> 00:12:03,222
Believe me when I tell you
I don't say this very often,

242
00:12:04,713 --> 00:12:06,225
But i think i like you.

243
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,561
Well, give me those peep toes
and maybe I'll believe you.

244
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:11,229
Sorry. My alexandre birmans
are sacred.

245
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,647
Amen.

246
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,059
By the way, i'm Brandeis.

247
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:19,071
How would you like to come with
me to a fabulous party tonight ?

248
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,827
"Mat." Are you joking ?

249
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,497
Not in the least.
It's going on the end of "door,"

250
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,034
Which makes it a triple word
score, scrabble bitches.

251
00:12:30,118 --> 00:12:32,626
- That's my son.
- The Humphreys are so serious

252
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,139
about their scrabble games.

253
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:37,195
You two are so sweet to come over
and entertain Jenny. Poor thing !

254
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,550
Well, she's been cooped up
with this virus for a week.

255
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,968
- {\I mean, }When she called, how could we resist ?
- Yeah. Thank you guys so much.

256
00:12:43,606 --> 00:12:45,180
Really getting sick of,

257
00:12:45,638 --> 00:12:47,547
tv and internet.

258
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,650
- I need a S.A.R.S. Mask.
- Can i borrow your phone ?

259
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:56,773
- Yeah, go ahead.
- I keep leaving mine in the dorm.

260
00:12:58,438 --> 00:12:59,236
That's 33.

261
00:12:59,698 --> 00:13:02,156
A whopping 33 points.

262
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,583
"jetdoorman" Is that a word ?

263
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:06,220
Don't you mean "jetdoormat" ?

264
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,109
- Oh, jetdoormat.
- S.A.R.S. Mask !

265
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,250
<i>So it's election day.
Who are you voting for?</i>

266
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:16,294
<i>I don't know.
That's a good question.</i>

267
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,463
<i>You know,
i'm not really sure</i>

268
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,216
<i>Who i'm gonna vote for.
He's awfully young.</i>

269
00:13:23,246 --> 00:13:24,869
<i>You know, i'm not really,</i>

270
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:29,517
What?

271
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,557
<i>sure who i'm gonna vote for.
He's awfully young.</i>

272
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,621
You look hot.

273
00:13:40,294 --> 00:13:42,504
Same. I have great news.

274
00:13:42,628 --> 00:13:44,197
- Yeah. So do I.
- You first.

275
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,601
I just finished reading
a fantastic script.

276
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:49,662
- The political thriller ?
- No, it's a remake of "leaving Las Vegas",

277
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,497
they want redo it with a younger cast.
- Where did you get those scripts ?

278
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,252
In the garbage. I'm telling you,
this one's amazing.

279
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:58,092
- Care to join me in a little research ?
- No. No research.

280
00:13:58,176 --> 00:14:01,047
Your team has been pushing
very hard for the political one.

281
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,914
and i have worked my butt off to
get you into this party tonight.

282
00:14:03,998 --> 00:14:07,513
But miley cyrus is already signed on
to play the Elisabeth Shue role.

283
00:14:07,657 --> 00:14:09,890
They must've seen her
on that pole at the T.C.A.S.

284
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,957
Okay, we don't have time to talk
about this. You need to get ready.

285
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,733
This party is a very big deal
for both of us.

286
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:18,503
There will be tons of important
political people there tonight.

287
00:14:18,928 --> 00:14:21,630
Forget vegas.
It's all about D.C., okay?

288
00:14:26,288 --> 00:14:27,782
Put on some clothes, please.

289
00:14:33,216 --> 00:14:35,207
Listen, i'm really busy.
This couldn't wait ?

290
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,377
Honestly, no.

291
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,047
And I thought it'd be better
to talk away from the campaign chaos.

292
00:14:44,604 --> 00:14:46,552
I'm in a really awkward position,

293
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,524
so I'm just gonna say
what i have to say.

294
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,011
What happened at the Hudson
this morning wasn't what it looked like.

295
00:14:55,484 --> 00:14:56,850
What do you mean ?

296
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,813
The guy you and Tripp saved,

297
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:01,775
he didn't fall.

298
00:15:03,181 --> 00:15:04,737
I think it was set up.

299
00:15:07,443 --> 00:15:09,905
- That's ridiculous.
- I have it all on tape.

300
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:16,540
- {\Well, }Has anyone else seen the footage ?
- No, but I ...

301
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:20,377
I already agreed to sell it to New York 1,
and I'm going to meet Caroline Lowe,

302
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:22,142
One of the producers,
at cafeteria.

303
00:15:22,229 --> 00:15:24,751
Wait. Vanessa,
if you do that, then

304
00:15:24,835 --> 00:15:27,509
Nate, I'm sorry,
but if I just sit on it,

305
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,763
- I become part of a cover-up.
- {\Listen, }The polls close in a few hours.

306
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:32,013
Can you just wait ?

307
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,141
I wish i could, but this is not
some high school thing

308
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,769
with Blair and the mean girls. This is
someone running for public office.

309
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,143
Yeah, but there's gotta be
some sort of an explanation.

310
00:15:41,745 --> 00:15:44,109
Someone set tripp up
to look like a hero,

311
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,111
and I think we both know
the person most likely

312
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,324
to orchestrate something
like that is your grandfather.

313
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,034
I have so much respect for Tripp,

314
00:15:54,118 --> 00:15:57,088
and he has been so generous
to let me film his campaign.

315
00:15:57,172 --> 00:16:00,125
Should i warn him so he can prepare
a strategy for damage control ?

316
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,789
Don't worry about telling Tripp.

317
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:03,285
Okay ? I'll tell him.

318
00:16:08,387 --> 00:16:09,176
I'm sorry.

319
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:20,114
<i>This election may be
too close to call,</i>

320
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,363
<i>But when it's
his family's honor or his own,</i>

321
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:26,092
<i>Nate archibald has the number
on speed dial.</i>

322
00:16:26,176 --> 00:16:28,521
Yes, uh, new york 1, please.

323
00:16:29,913 --> 00:16:31,197
Caroline lowe.

324
00:16:40,154 --> 00:16:42,675
Wow. Thank you so much
for explaining that.

325
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,929
Hey,
we were just discussing

326
00:16:45,013 --> 00:16:46,674
the senate committee
on appropriations.

327
00:16:46,776 --> 00:16:49,716
Maybe you'd like to join us.
Oh, my god. Hello.

328
00:16:50,305 --> 00:16:51,426
Thank you so much.

329
00:16:52,964 --> 00:16:54,259
See? Isn't this great?

330
00:16:54,343 --> 00:16:56,741
you've got the the perfect
capitol hill vibe.

331
00:16:56,825 --> 00:16:58,512
- I gotta hit the can.
- Okay.

332
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,021
He's great. Do you wanna...

333
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,693
Oh, my god.
That's senator proctor.

334
00:17:07,863 --> 00:17:10,278
Wow. You really
do know everyone.

335
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,655
Oh, i don't know everyone.
I'll be right back.

336
00:17:15,423 --> 00:17:18,212
Do you see that gorgeous
blonde in proenza schouler

337
00:17:18,296 --> 00:17:20,183
talking to those
high-profile politicians ?

338
00:17:20,267 --> 00:17:21,831
That's my best friend
brandeis.

339
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:25,407
- She knows most of them personally.
- That's great. {\I mean, }Political connections

340
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:27,671
Aren't the first thing
most people look for in friends.

341
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,548
They must really love her,
because when

342
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,800
she introduced us,
they seemed thrilled to meet me.

343
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,763
- They even asked if we were sisters.
- I can't wait for you to meet patrick.

344
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:36,555
He's over at the bar,
getting me a drink{\ right now}.

345
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,892
- I feel so lucky. He's so attentive.
- It doesn't take much, does it ?

346
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,851
What? No one's ever
accused you of saying no.

347
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:01,100
where is the scrabble dictionary ?
I could swear "squiffy's" a word.

348
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,497
Scrabble dictionary.

349
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:08,690
Bathroom boy ?

350
00:18:12,005 --> 00:18:15,093
<i>All right, you know our next guest from
the "endless knights" movie franchise</i>

351
00:18:15,197 --> 00:18:17,599
<i>Please welcome the lovely
olivia burke, everybody!</i>

352
00:18:21,295 --> 00:18:22,432
She's cute.

353
00:18:22,516 --> 00:18:25,674
<i>Many year of private sector invent,
after retire he served </i>

354
00:18:25,758 --> 00:18:29,093
<i>four years on city council
and ten in the state legislature.</i>

355
00:18:29,177 --> 00:18:30,912
<i>He was a supporter
of John McCain,</i>

356
00:18:30,996 --> 00:18:33,696
<i>Stumping for him all across
rural upstate new york</i>

357
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,656
<i>In the 2008 presidential race.</i>

358
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:39,157
Someone just told me you're
vanessa abrams. Is that right?

359
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,513
So who did you end up
selling the footage to?

360
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:46,072
My office just called, said that you sold
your rescue footage to another network.

361
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,574
Yeah, i sold it
to new york 1, actually--

362
00:18:48,658 --> 00:18:50,402
A woman named Caroline Lowe.

363
00:18:51,022 --> 00:18:52,458
I met her two hours ago.

364
00:18:52,784 --> 00:18:54,049
I'm caroline lowe.

365
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:58,803
So who was the woman
in the restaurant?

366
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:07,562
Finally. It's your turn.

367
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,238
You know what ? I just realized i have

368
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:11,122
an environmental studies
paper due tomorrow.

369
00:19:11,206 --> 00:19:13,735
Oh, wait.
Um, i'll just get my stuff.

370
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,988
No{\, you know what?} Stay. You're winning,
and you gotta keep Jenny company.

371
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,881
I'll text you later, okay?

372
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,742
Did my son just walk out

373
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,536
before playing a "q"
on a double letter?

374
00:19:22,813 --> 00:19:24,496
That is so not
the humphrey way.

375
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,374
My computer.

376
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:33,630
You know, i am sensing
something else is going on here.

377
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,955
Well, you didn't actually
think they wanted

378
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:39,239
to play five hours worth
of board games with us, did you?

379
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:42,834
# All these girls be in my face #

380
00:19:42,918 --> 00:19:44,709
# that's why I grab that can of mace #

381
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:47,769
# because I got expensive taste #
- Looking for your boyfriend ?

382
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,422
No. He's probably getting
mobbed by fans right now.

383
00:19:52,506 --> 00:19:54,698
He's just still on the way
to get us a drink.

384
00:19:54,782 --> 00:19:57,421
Doubt it, because he downed
both your drinks

385
00:19:57,505 --> 00:19:59,697
and then ordered two more.
For himself.

386
00:20:00,843 --> 00:20:03,159
- Where is he?
- Don't worry. I took care of it.

387
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,661
I had him taken up to his suite.

388
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,664
- What? Why?
- He's bombed.

389
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,402
He's drunker than Paula abdul
during Hollywood week.

390
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:12,794
Are you really that
jealous that he's here with me ?

391
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,412
Look, s., you know wasted
better than most of us,

392
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:17,466
having been in that state
so many times yourself.

393
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,921
I guess you just met your match.

394
00:20:19,005 --> 00:20:21,594
But since i just found out
that your date is really work,

395
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,814
You may want to play closer
attention to him next time.

396
00:20:23,898 --> 00:20:25,766
This is Nate's big night
at Chuck's hotel,

397
00:20:25,908 --> 00:20:29,995
So sorry S., I did
what i had to do again.

398
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,532
<i>So you're out with this guy,
and he goes to the bathroom.</i>

399
00:20:35,616 --> 00:20:38,511
<i>- He comes back !
- It was our first date,</i>

400
00:20:38,595 --> 00:20:43,706
<i>and he goes to the restroom and when
he comes back, his shirt was on inside out.</i>

401
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,492
<i>Check, please.
That's where you go right there.</i>

402
00:20:46,524 --> 00:20:48,922
<i>That's when you get out.
That's when you have to leave.</i>

403
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:50,576
<i>No, I find out later that on the way</i>

404
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,862
<i>Into the bathroom, he's walked
into a spiderweb,</i>

405
00:20:52,946 --> 00:20:54,701
<i>And the spider crawled
inside his shirt.</i>

406
00:20:54,785 --> 00:20:56,950
<i>Yeah, the old spider excuse.</i>

407
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,905
<i>Yeah, we've all used
that one before.</i>

408
00:20:58,989 --> 00:21:01,311
<i>Yeah, the old "oh, a spider
came down on my shirt,</i>

409
00:21:01,395 --> 00:21:03,904
<i>And that's why i had to take
my shirt off and"--</i>

410
00:21:03,988 --> 00:21:07,772
<i>Okay, I believe that.
I would believe that one.</i>

411
00:21:07,856 --> 00:21:11,853
<i>And now are you still
dating bathroom boy or...</i>

412
00:21:11,935 --> 00:21:15,643
<i>- Was he arrested? I don't know.
- Tomorrow is our 1-Month anniversary.</i>

413
00:21:15,706 --> 00:21:17,961
<i>Oh, oh, my gosh.
Well, congratulations.</i>

414
00:21:18,057 --> 00:21:20,842
<i>- Yeah it's big.
- In honor, i'll be taking my clothes off</i>

415
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:23,100
<i>In the bathroom
and then redressing myself.</i>

416
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:25,027
After all that scrabble ...

417
00:21:25,111 --> 00:21:28,036
I can't believe I told
that story on national television.

418
00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:29,955
He must hate me.

419
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:35,190
Please pick up.
Please pick up.

420
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,546
it went to voice mail.

421
00:21:39,413 --> 00:21:40,965
Hey. Um, it's me.

422
00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:45,720
I know that you're not picking up
because you must be so mad at me.

423
00:21:46,229 --> 00:21:48,264
Please know
that i'm so, so sorry.

424
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,070
What are you doing ?

425
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,072
I told you how important
tonight was.

426
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:11,128
You think blair had me thrown out
because i was a little tipsy

427
00:22:11,212 --> 00:22:14,707
or because I was talking to that
high-priced call girl friend of hers ?

428
00:22:16,994 --> 00:22:18,128
What did you just say?

429
00:22:21,434 --> 00:22:23,988
<i># I wish I never would have
let you go #</i>

430
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,504
<i># but the music... #</i>

431
00:22:26,535 --> 00:22:28,436
- Why'd you do it ?
- Do what?

432
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,384
Come on.
You're the only one who knew

433
00:22:30,468 --> 00:22:32,809
I had a meeting to sell that footage.
- I had to protect tripp.

434
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,753
I came to you first, as a friend.

435
00:22:34,837 --> 00:22:37,313
Don't be so self-righteous.
You were only selling the footage

436
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,024
to further your own career.
- That is not true.

437
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,412
Oh, so you're saying you weren't
excited to see your name

438
00:22:42,504 --> 00:22:44,487
Flash on every television
in manhattan?

439
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,032
You know what ? I'll let you know
how that feels in just a minute.

440
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,409
<i>- What does that mean ?
Everybody, quiet down for a second.</i>

441
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,453
<i>Breaking news.</i>

442
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:53,892
<i>We are just now getting reports
that firsthand footage</i>

443
00:22:53,976 --> 00:22:56,948
<i>of the hudson river rescue
reveals Tripp Van Der Bilt's</i>

444
00:22:57,032 --> 00:23:00,003
<i>heroic act might not
have been so heroic.</i>

445
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:03,372
<i>It seems after close inspection
of the footage taken at the time,</i>

446
00:23:03,456 --> 00:23:06,265
<i>it's apparent the man deliberately
went into the hudson river...</i>

447
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:11,030
<i>The polls are closed, and Gossip Girl
is calling this election dirty.</i>

448
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,342
<i>It remains to be seen</i>

449
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:15,920
<i>Who exactly is responsible
for this hoax.</i>

450
00:23:16,004 --> 00:23:19,689
<i>Someone in the Van Der Bilt camp ?
Maybe the candidate himself ?<i/></i>

451
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,914
<i>But news of this breaking...
- Grandfather !</i>

452
00:23:21,998 --> 00:23:24,736
<i>...effect it'll have on the polls
Is impossible to measure.</i>

453
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,072
All right, could someone
just turn that off ?

454
00:23:30,467 --> 00:23:33,785
And, please, just give us
a moment of privacy. Thank you.

455
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,336
I can't believe

456
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,544
You would compromise
my integrity like this.

457
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,879
Take a deep breath.

458
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,382
You didn't believe
i could actually win, did you?

459
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:48,268
Honestly, i had my doubts,

460
00:23:48,616 --> 00:23:49,761
But i did not do this.

461
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,325
- The hell you didn't.
- Just calm down.

462
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:54,725
<i>Listen to me very carefully,
grandfather.</i>

463
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:57,205
If you don't go out there
and take responsibility for this,

464
00:23:57,289 --> 00:23:59,855
then I will
by stepping out of the race.

465
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,273
I'm not gonna go stand in front
of those cameras and lie.

466
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:05,153
Oh, come on, grandfather.
It's time to come clean.

467
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:09,323
I give you my word.
I'm not responsible for this.

468
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,389
Unfortunately
for the both of us,

469
00:24:12,088 --> 00:24:14,035
Your word means nothing anymore.

470
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:21,313
Well, if you are both done,

471
00:24:21,397 --> 00:24:23,503
I'm going to go down
and join the celebration.

472
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,638
Gather the press.

473
00:24:29,651 --> 00:24:31,923
I'm going to announce
my official withdrawal.

474
00:24:33,713 --> 00:24:35,472
I just have to tell maureen first.

475
00:24:49,694 --> 00:24:52,135
I know I'm an enemy of the state
right now.

476
00:24:54,371 --> 00:24:56,077
What happened to you, nate?

477
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,955
The guy i used to call
my friend

478
00:24:59,635 --> 00:25:01,082
Had a moral compass.

479
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,403
Well, right now i'm thinking i'm
just gonna go for my master's,

480
00:25:11,707 --> 00:25:12,844
but who knows?

481
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:16,639
Sorry to interrupt.
Brandeis, right? I'm serena.

482
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:20,268
- Hi, serena. This is congressman wade.
- Pleasure to meet you.

483
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,816
And are you a, uh, student,
like brandeis?

484
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,982
No, i'm just
a regular old working girl.

485
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,110
Really ? And do you two
work together ?

486
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,189
- Because maybe the three of us ...
- Congressman,

487
00:25:31,273 --> 00:25:33,241
you've been campaigning
a little too hard.

488
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,605
Let me guess,
you want to go upstairs

489
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:39,162
and see if two blondes make a right ?
- Excuse us.

490
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:44,234
I'm sorry.
I thought i was working

491
00:25:44,318 --> 00:25:46,626
this party alone.
Did the agency send you ?

492
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:51,589
No, you're right.
This party is all yours.

493
00:25:51,821 --> 00:25:52,986
Excuse me.

494
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,680
As a friend of the family, what
do you have to say about the allegation

495
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:59,382
that Tripp Van Der Bilt's
heroism might have been staged?

496
00:25:59,466 --> 00:26:01,946
I say I'm a businessman,
not a politician.

497
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,601
Fine, so how will it affect
your business

498
00:26:03,731 --> 00:26:07,064
If the empire's inaugural event
is mired in scandal?

499
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:11,275
Look, you think anyone goes to
the mercer for the maid service?

500
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,905
They go 'cause they want to see
russell crowe throw a hissy.

501
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:17,672
Anyway, nothing happens
at the empire without my say-So.

502
00:26:17,756 --> 00:26:19,993
<i>Excuse me sir, would you
please comme with me ?</i>

503
00:26:20,528 --> 00:26:23,721
<i>- Sir I need you to put some pants on.
- Where are you taking me ?</i>

504
00:26:31,494 --> 00:26:33,925
What are you doing, blair?
Looking for your best friend?

505
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,218
Bad news.
Security just escorted her out

506
00:26:36,302 --> 00:26:38,554
in time to avoid
a major political scandal.

507
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,099
You're kidding me.
Now we're doing tit for tat?

508
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:44,152
She was an escort,
a high-Priced hooker.

509
00:26:45,775 --> 00:26:47,116
You're ridiculous.

510
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,732
Brandeis is not a call girl.
She's a psych major.

511
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,689
- Who on earth told you that?
- Patrick.

512
00:26:51,773 --> 00:26:53,158
The guy is wasted.

513
00:26:53,242 --> 00:26:56,155
He thought chuck schumer was his father.
You're just trying to get back at me.

514
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,991
No, actually, I'm just
looking out for chuck and nate.

515
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,350
I doubt chuck would want
a prostitute at his hotel,

516
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,579
especially at this party.
- You don't get it.

517
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:07,042
Patrick was about to cause a scene.
I was protecting everyone, including you.

518
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:10,418
- What are you talking about?
- Look, ladies, please.

519
00:27:10,502 --> 00:27:13,900
This is supposed to be a classy event,
not a sample sale at an outlet mall.

520
00:27:13,984 --> 00:27:15,550
You'll never believe what Serena did.

521
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,635
She had my friend
kicked out of the party.

522
00:27:18,578 --> 00:27:20,888
The call girl ?
Security just told me.

523
00:27:22,197 --> 00:27:25,061
No, I promise you,
Brandeis is not an escort.

524
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:27,270
Serena's just trying
to get even with me.

525
00:27:28,783 --> 00:27:30,464
Look, i don't know
what's going on here,

526
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:33,484
but if the girl's still here, I'll find
her and get to the bottom of it, okay ?

527
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,015
Thank you, chuck.

528
00:27:35,814 --> 00:27:38,322
And who's the one getting paid
to date her clients anyway?

529
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,574
That's enough, Blair.

530
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:42,119
If it walks like a duck
and talks like a duck...

531
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:47,541
The only prostitute here,
is you.

532
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:52,459
Come on, chuck.
I want some cake.

533
00:28:00,628 --> 00:28:03,103
<i>Blair and Serena at war again.</i>

534
00:28:03,912 --> 00:28:04,807
<i>Yummy.</i>

535
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:13,215
- Let me go first.
- It's okay. I know what i'm doing.

536
00:28:22,005 --> 00:28:22,825
Excuse me.

537
00:28:23,794 --> 00:28:24,661
Excuse me.

538
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:31,625
My name is nate Archibald.
I'm tripp Van Der Bilt's cousin.

539
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:34,670
And i know there's
a lot of buzz going around

540
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:37,590
About what exactly happened
this morning at the hudson river.

541
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:41,010
And it saddens me
to tell you all

542
00:28:41,705 --> 00:28:43,939
That the story about it being a hoax

543
00:28:44,518 --> 00:28:45,431
It is true.

544
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:51,310
However, my cousin,
tripp van der bilt,

545
00:28:52,054 --> 00:28:55,149
had no knowledge of any kind of setup.

546
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,568
My cousin is not only
the most moral,

547
00:28:58,193 --> 00:28:59,263
Honest...

548
00:29:00,476 --> 00:29:02,281
And courageous guy i know...

549
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,368
He's still a hero.

550
00:29:07,632 --> 00:29:09,088
How do i know this ?

551
00:29:12,704 --> 00:29:14,704
Because I'm the one who set it up.

552
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:33,521
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Right now, thirst. I need a drink.

553
00:29:34,491 --> 00:29:35,815
She called me a prostitute.

554
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,666
- Yeah. Why do you think she did that ?
- I'm not sleeping with Patrick.

555
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,612
You of all people,
know what a prostitute does.

556
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,905
The reason blair attacked you
is because she misses you.

557
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:46,194
Don't tell me after 18 years,
you can't read waldorf subtext.

558
00:29:46,278 --> 00:29:49,370
I shouldn't have to. If that's what
she's feeling, then she should tell me.

559
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,935
It is time for her to grow up.

560
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:53,626
This coming from someone who just
pushed their best friend into a cake.

561
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:59,380
Look, you think your friendship
is going to take care of itself.

562
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,346
You're not kids anymore. You
can't say you hate each other

563
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,931
then make up an hour later
on the met steps.

564
00:30:05,864 --> 00:30:07,656
- You tell her that.
- I'm telling you.

565
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,421
And you should be careful,
because one day you're

566
00:30:10,505 --> 00:30:14,239
gonna find yourself telling
people about blair waldorf,

567
00:30:14,782 --> 00:30:16,519
the girl who used to be
your best friend.

568
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,951
I got your text.

569
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,870
- All it said was
- "Maybe we should talk"

570
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,132
And so i just came
right away.

571
00:30:35,462 --> 00:30:36,751
I'm sorry about Fallon.

572
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,129
Up till now, my publicist would
decide everything for me--

573
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:43,876
What I'd talk about during interviews
and even script exactly what I would say.

574
00:30:43,963 --> 00:30:46,886
And just this one time,
i wanted to just... be myself

575
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,931
And go out there and be me,
and I bombed.

576
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,142
What ? No, you didn't.
It was funny, really.

577
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,812
And then today, you left, and I
knew that I'd hurt you.

578
00:30:57,762 --> 00:30:59,565
And our first date
meant so much to me.

579
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,094
Olivia, fallon was right.

580
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,974
The spider story
isn't even true.

581
00:31:07,197 --> 00:31:08,407
What is this ?

582
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,094
You want to know the truth
about our first date ?

583
00:31:11,449 --> 00:31:14,129
There was no spider.
I was so nervous

584
00:31:14,213 --> 00:31:16,746
that I was with you, I kept
sweating through my shirt,

585
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,334
So i was running to the bathroom
to use the hand dryer to

586
00:31:19,418 --> 00:31:23,411
- What ? This isn't funny. Don't laugh.
- I'm not. I'm really trying not to.

587
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,683
And then today, I rushed out
of scrabble because i'd just seen

588
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:28,768
your interview on tv,
where you told the whole world

589
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:31,347
That today was our 1-Month
anniversary, you know, and...

590
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,860
I mean, I'm usually very on the ball
with these things.

591
00:31:35,554 --> 00:31:36,891
Stop. You're amazing.

592
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,276
And you're not the only one
with a surprise today.

593
00:31:46,883 --> 00:31:48,497
<i>You're watching New York 1</i>

594
00:31:48,586 --> 00:31:50,203
<i>News all evening.</i>

595
00:31:51,346 --> 00:31:53,999
<i>Before we return to the race
for the mayor of new york city,</i>

596
00:31:54,088 --> 00:31:56,643
<i>we first want to take you
to the congressional election,</i>

597
00:31:56,745 --> 00:31:58,750
<i>which really couldn't be
any closer.</i>

598
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,835
<i>At this time, with 85%
of the votes counted,</i>

599
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,976
<i>Mike sullivan has 49,837 votes.
Tripp Van Der Bilt 51,348</i>

600
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,206
What are you doing down here?
Get back to your party.

601
00:32:09,301 --> 00:32:11,056
I was hoping you'd still be here.

602
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:13,624
I wanted to thank you

603
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:15,782
for the sacrifice you made
on that stage tonight,

604
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:17,018
For me.

605
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:21,856
I was happy to,
because i believe in you.

606
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,365
<i>Here it is. We are now prepared
to call the election in favor </i>

607
00:32:24,449 --> 00:32:26,364
<i>And apparently,
new york does, too.</i>

608
00:32:26,448 --> 00:32:30,239
<i>of newcomer 26 Year-Old
William Van Der Bilt III,</i>

609
00:32:30,434 --> 00:32:33,191
<i>Affectionately known to those
around him as "Tripp."</i>

610
00:32:33,275 --> 00:32:36,076
<i>That is right. With 96%
of the votes counted ...</i>

611
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,455
- I won.
- Yeah, you did.

612
00:32:38,322 --> 00:32:40,457
- Just do me one favor, though.
- Anything.

613
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,127
Be the best congressman
this district's ever seen.

614
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:44,879
I have complete faith in you.

615
00:32:45,893 --> 00:32:49,425
And after all, i mean, you're
the only honest man in our family.

616
00:32:55,453 --> 00:32:58,100
- Congrats. You deserve it.
- Thanks.

617
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:01,687
I better get going before we're seen
together and another scandal erupts.

618
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:02,924
I promise you,

619
00:33:03,421 --> 00:33:06,775
One day i will make things
right. I will fix this.

620
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,403
This is the beginning
of a new van der bilt dynasty,

621
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,084
One we can be proud of.

622
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,225
Stay away from me.

623
00:33:39,423 --> 00:33:40,918
Blair, i'm sorry.

624
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,232
I shouldn't have done that.

625
00:33:45,077 --> 00:33:47,445
but whether it was
patrick tonight

626
00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:50,038
or K.C.'s clients at chuck's party,

627
00:33:50,122 --> 00:33:52,705
a real friend would have
come to me with the problem,

628
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:56,120
and we would have solved it together.
- Seriously, Serena ?

629
00:33:56,349 --> 00:33:59,078
After 18 years of this,
I actually feel sorry for you.

630
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:01,087
You're so far deep
in serena world,

631
00:34:01,171 --> 00:34:03,499
You can't even recognize
what's really going on.

632
00:34:05,137 --> 00:34:07,229
Throughout all my years
with nate--

633
00:34:07,676 --> 00:34:09,240
My whole life, really--

634
00:34:10,742 --> 00:34:14,134
You've always been number one.
And now for the first time,

635
00:34:15,523 --> 00:34:16,993
things are different.

636
00:34:17,491 --> 00:34:19,775
I'm different.
I have college

637
00:34:19,876 --> 00:34:21,454
And a real relationship.

638
00:34:22,939 --> 00:34:26,021
I'm starting to build a life
for myself.

639
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:28,524
I'm building a life for myself, too.

640
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,193
With carter ? With your job
as an assistant to a publicist

641
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,404
who pays you to date
a whacked-out movie star ?

642
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:40,333
You're drifting away from Dan and
your family, and you've lost Nate,

643
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:42,099
One of your oldest friends.

644
00:34:48,024 --> 00:34:49,874
This night
is finally over...

645
00:34:52,117 --> 00:34:54,383
And as far as i'm concerned,
so are we.

646
00:34:57,301 --> 00:34:58,517
<i>Who would have thought</i>

647
00:34:58,601 --> 00:35:01,424
<i>that S. and B.'s friendship
had a term limit?</i>

648
00:35:01,508 --> 00:35:02,776
<i>Sorry, ladies.</i>

649
00:35:03,491 --> 00:35:04,701
<i>Party's over.</i>

650
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,095
Thank you.

651
00:35:10,334 --> 00:35:11,432
Brandeis.

652
00:35:11,824 --> 00:35:13,486
I thought you'd be long gone by now.

653
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,863
- Great party.
- I am so sorry.

654
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,990
I can't believe Serena told
everyone you were a prostitute.

655
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:21,024
That is, like, so crazy.

656
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:25,080
Well, to be honest,
it's not that crazy.

657
00:35:26,328 --> 00:35:27,106
How so?

658
00:35:27,405 --> 00:35:29,553
It's true.
I'm a working girl.

659
00:35:29,637 --> 00:35:31,712
I wanted to tell you,
but we just met.

660
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,007
Do you even go to school at N.Y.U.?

661
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,260
Yes. And i am a psych major.

662
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,012
Ask me anything
Freud, skinner, Piaget.

663
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,681
I'm still the same person,

664
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:44,308
this is just how i pay
for college and couture.

665
00:35:50,812 --> 00:35:53,248
Well, i have to run it
by my people, but...

666
00:35:54,327 --> 00:35:57,571
We can still shop together,
perhaps.

667
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:58,739
Absolutely.

668
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,430
But right now...

669
00:36:03,299 --> 00:36:04,202
I got a job.

670
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,542
You used me to meet new clients ?

671
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,711
Sorry, but I'm new to the big apple.

672
00:36:15,629 --> 00:36:17,739
And rotten to the core.

673
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,591
Okay, come on. Come on.

674
00:36:21,964 --> 00:36:23,545
Let's get you in. Easy.

675
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,796
- Come on. Watch your head.
- Hey, come on. Let's go to bar Boulud.

676
00:36:28,197 --> 00:36:30,431
You have to. You're my girlfriend.

677
00:36:30,968 --> 00:36:33,522
I can't be seen without you,
remember?

678
00:36:33,612 --> 00:36:35,189
That's what
you get paid for.

679
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:54,080
710 east 76th street.
Tell miss cunningham she has a delivery.

680
00:37:16,507 --> 00:37:19,576
I think nathaniel was brilliant
tonight, don't you?

681
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,342
Brilliant?
Foolish is more like it.

682
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:24,107
Come on, william.

683
00:37:24,191 --> 00:37:25,980
Even you have to admit it.

684
00:37:26,669 --> 00:37:29,633
This couldn't have worked
any better if it was planned.

685
00:37:35,376 --> 00:37:36,109
You.

686
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:40,108
All this time, you thought
the only thing i was capable of

687
00:37:40,192 --> 00:37:42,858
was holding his hand
and smiling on the sidelines.

688
00:37:43,919 --> 00:37:45,383
To be honest, my dear,

689
00:37:45,952 --> 00:37:48,518
I never really spent that much
time thinking about you.

690
00:37:49,096 --> 00:37:52,017
Well, your loss is my gain.

691
00:37:53,102 --> 00:37:55,272
My husband is
a congressman.

692
00:37:55,975 --> 00:37:59,318
And thanks to vanessa's camera,
You're out of our lives for good.

693
00:37:59,718 --> 00:38:01,977
Finally Tripp
can be his own man,

694
00:38:02,899 --> 00:38:03,613
My man.

695
00:38:04,186 --> 00:38:08,411
You think i'm really just going to stand
aside, let myself become collateral damage?

696
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:10,412
I'll tell him.

697
00:38:12,229 --> 00:38:15,292
You don't exactly have a lot
of credibility right now.

698
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,462
Who's he going to believe?

699
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:34,104
I thought you said
you were going home.

700
00:38:35,907 --> 00:38:37,275
I changed my mind.

701
00:38:38,018 --> 00:38:40,816
Well, if I'd known,
I would have come sooner.

702
00:38:42,222 --> 00:38:46,026
# I'm sitting across from you #

703
00:38:46,678 --> 00:38:48,584
Did you ever find Brandeis ?

704
00:38:50,283 --> 00:38:51,541
# I don't speak #
- Yes.

705
00:38:52,548 --> 00:38:54,033
# You don't know me #

706
00:38:54,117 --> 00:38:55,783
We're not friends anymore.

707
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:00,492
# I say nothing
but stare at you #

708
00:39:00,576 --> 00:39:01,790
But that's okay.

709
00:39:02,814 --> 00:39:03,806
I have you.

710
00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:06,584
That's all I need.

711
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:08,993
# I see you #

712
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:12,615
# that I see you #

713
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:16,559
# that I see you #

Thank you.

733
00:40:24,703 --> 00:40:26,728
Shouldn't you be
in the ballroom?

734
00:40:26,812 --> 00:40:27,820
Probably.

735
00:40:28,209 --> 00:40:29,425
Where's your better half?

736
00:40:30,379 --> 00:40:32,877
I don't know.
I was looking for her.

737
00:40:33,609 --> 00:40:36,225
Then i realized this might be
my last private moment for a while.

738
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:40,763
Well, i can leave.
No, it's okay. Stay. Please.

739
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:43,141
I'd love to have someone to sit with,

740
00:40:43,506 --> 00:40:46,618
Not talking about politics,
not talking about anything.

741
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,486
You wanna tell me about it?

742
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,829
No. I don't think you want
to hear this one.

743
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,414
I do. Let your problem

744
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:01,541
Be the first that i address
as your elected representative.

745
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,035
Okay, congressman.

746
00:41:06,087 --> 00:41:09,132
But i'm gonna warn you. This one
might need a special committee.

747
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:13,720
This sounds serious.
Bartender, I'll have what she's having.

748
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,821
I'll have another, please.
Thank you.
