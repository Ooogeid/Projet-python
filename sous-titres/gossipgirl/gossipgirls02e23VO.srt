just skip town.

00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,700
He took off with all the money that
he got my mom And the co-Op to invest, 

34
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,400
and he took poppy's money, too.

35
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,000
The entire thing was a scam.

36
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,900
Well, his suits never did
fit right. How much did he get?

37
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,600
I'm not sure. I'm on my way home
to tell my mom right now.

38
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,100
When are you gonna be back?

39
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,600
As fast as i can, Given my current
transportation situation.

40
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,700
Hey, chuck,
i really am sorry

41
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,100
For not believing
you and blair earlier.

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,900
But you never did tell me
how you found out ???

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,300
I'll explain
when i get there.

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,500
No, thank you.

45
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,100
The lord cannot enter
a body sullied by alcohol.

46
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,700
Good, 

47
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,700
because i like to be
the one doing the entering.

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,200
To each their own holy water.

49
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,700
We want the harp
and not the cello,

50
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,900
And make sure we have
two cases of champagne. 

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,700
Okay. Good-Bye. 

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,300
I didn't even know
you were out.

53
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,900
Yeah, i had to go
and try to catch--

54
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,800
Gabriel? We had such a nice time
with you two last night.

55
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,600
He is so charming,
and that idea...

56
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,900
yeah, actually, um, i-I wanted
to talk to you about that.

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,500
Okay, but before you do, 

58
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,200
there is something
i want you to have.

59
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,800
I was gonna wait
until you were 21,

60
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,600
But i've been so proud of you lately,
With brown and graduation coming.

61
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,500
Go ahead. Open it.

62
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,000
It was your great grandmother's.

63
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,600
I took it out of the, uh,
safety deposit box this morning.

64
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,500
It's beautiful, mom,
but it's--It's too much.

65
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,400
i-I can't accept it.

66
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
I don't deserve it.

67
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, of course you do. Serena, 

68
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,700
you're becoming
a wonderful woman,

69
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,700
And i want you to have Something
that represents that.

70
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,100
Now tell me, what were you
gonna say about gabriel?

71
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,900
oh, it must be the caterer.

72
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,800
Yeah, um, just take that,
and--And we'll talk later, okay?

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,600
and thank you.
This is really... something.

74
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,700
uh, don't forget. We have
to leave for brunch in ten minutes.

75
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,900
- Yeah.
- Hello?

76
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,900
Yes. Okay.

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,900
Hey, blair. It's me. Um, 

78
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,300
i need your help again.

79
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,900
I'm on my way. 

80
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,300
- We'll have to continue
this later. Serena needs me.
- No, no, no.

81
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,700
"Serena needs me" is Officially
an no longer excuse to avoid talking.

82
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,400
She's my best friend.

83
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,100
The question of whether you got this
apartment Because you love me 

84
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,000
or because you don't trust me
Will have to wait.

85
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,000
Fine. That wasn't even
the question.

86
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,600
The question was and remains--

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,200
Do you want
to live in it with me?

88
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,500
Serena's waiting.

89
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,500
Fine. I'm coming with you.

90
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,500
Have a great day.

91
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay, dad, seriously,
this whole happy thing?

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,100
It's a little annoying.

93
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,600
Yeah, seconded.
Humming is--Is fine for home,

94
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,400
But "zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah"
on the "f"?

95
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,800
I'm pretty sure whatever that lady said
Meant "stop" in her own language.

96
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,300
What's not to be happy about?
We're all together. You know,

97
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,000
serena's boyfriend let me in On an investment
that could pay for both your educations,

98
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,400
And i'm about
to propose to lily.

99
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,100
Wait. What? At brunch? ???

100
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,500
Oh, not quite yet. I still
have to ask permission.

101
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Uh, from--From who, cece?

102
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,400
No, lily's not even speaking
to her, and i'm fine with that.

103
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,400
The person whose permission
i seek is eric.

104
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,900
Well, he's gonna say yes.

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Well, still, serena's gonna
be at brown next year...

106
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,400
and eric's gonna be there.
He'll be the man of the house. So, um, 

107
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,000
after we eat, we'll go for a walk.
I'll show him the ring. 

108
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,200
Well, it looks like we're not gonna have
to wait Until next fall for serena to ditch. 

109
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,100
She's skipping brunch.

110
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Oh, i'd really hoped ???

111
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,500
Y-You know what?
Let me see what i can do.

112
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,200
I mean, she's generally
not a morning person,

113
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,000
But show up
with a bone dry cappuccino,

114
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,800
And she'll pretty much
follow you anywhere.

115
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,200
So, uh, you know, i'll--I'll
meet you at the restaurant.

116
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,700
And by the way, dad,
congratulations.

117
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,100
Dad!

118
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,500
Oh, i'm so glad you came, b.
Thank you so much for...

119
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,700
for bringing nate.

120
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,100
I'm just as flummoxed
as you are.

121
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,500
I got out at 53rd and made a run
for it, But he's faster than he looks.

122
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,700
What happened? Don't tell me
that hick gave you scabies.

123
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,900
He's gone, ???

124
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,900
And, b., if you tell me
"i told you so" right now,

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,700
I might lose it,
so please don't.

126
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,700
I'm sorry.

127
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,800
This isn'sot something
i wanted to be right about.

128
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,900
Are you okay?

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't know.

130
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,700
I don't know. I keep trying to figure out
what was real and what wasn't.

131
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,700
I... it doesn't make any sense.

132
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,200
Feelings never do.
They get you all confused.

133
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,400
Then they drive you around for hours Until
they drop you right back to where you started.

134
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,500
I need to fix this.

135
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,300
How can we help?

136
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,200
Well, i-I have a plan.

137
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,000
Tell me if you guys
think it's crazy.

138
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
Where's blair?

139
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,800
I agreed to give you a ride.

140
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,100
That's all.
Meals are not included.

141
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,000
i told you.
I just want to apologize.

142
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,600
One of the most sacred acts is
the ritual of forgiveness.

143
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,400
Why is it when you say "ritual,"
i think "human sacrifice"?

144
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,700
If i wanted to hurt blair, ???

145
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,800
Wait here.

146
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,900
Hey, gabriel, it's me.

147
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,700
Um, sorry i never came back
this morning.

148
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,900
But i was coming to tell you
something, and then i...

149
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,900
i got scared because...

150
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,700
???I hback on my leather seats.Ride

151
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,400
- shh.
- Um, because...

152
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
well, i might as well
just say it now,

153
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,500
Because i-I might get
too scared again.

154
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,800
I think i might be pregnant.

155
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,100
Okay. That's it.

156
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,300
Call me, please.

157
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,400
A pregnancy ruse--
Clich?But effective..

158
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,300
Make sure you arrange the meeting Someplace
where the authorities can surround him.

159
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,200
No open spaces.

160
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,100
You did call the police, right?

161
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,600
No, because then
my mom will find out,

162
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,200
And that can't happen.

163
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,100
Well, all this assumes that
the dirtbag even calls you back.

164
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,300
It's obviously time an expert
took over this operation.

165
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,800
???

166
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,400
You didn't mind my taking care of
it last night ??

167
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,400
Yeah, and, uh, left you
in the middle of nowhere.

168
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Serena... you should
let chuck handle this.

169
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,000
Gabriel's not calling back.

170
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,900
Just because he took off
with all the money

171
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,400
Doesn't mean the feelings
between us weren't real.

172
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,800
Look, not only do i think
he's gonna call me back,

173
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,300
All the money back from him.

174
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,400
What money?

175
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,400
I'm sorry. I just came to coerce
you into family brunch.

176
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,500
You didn't happen to see ???

177
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,400
Uh, no. No. Why?
What's going on?

178
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,900
Not that it's
any of your business,

179
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,600
buinvestment was also fake.'S

180
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,300
He made off with the money.
You can go now.

181
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,200
Wait. Wait a second. My dad invested
my college money with that guy.

182
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,100
Oh, my god. Dan, 

183
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,300
i'm so sorry. I-I didn't know.

184
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,300
Um, i-I have to tell him.

185
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
No, please don't.
I-I'm taking care of it.

186
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,600
I'm getting everything back.

187
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,200
Unfortunately for him, the only way her plan
is gonna work is by some act of god.</i>

188
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,600
Wow. Look at that.

189
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,900
I'm so glad
that everybody's here.

190
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,600
Uh, we need to get ???

191
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,100
- Chuck, what is she doing here?
- Are you trying to have me killed, bass?

192
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,900
- i'll--I'll do it.
- why is she here?

193
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,300
- i am going to scream
if somebody doesn't get her
- shh. Shut up.

194
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,100
- So is this how you found out
about that night at butter?
- Out of here right now.

195
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,400
You bring georgina here?

196
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,900
Hey, does anybody know
a gabriel?

197
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,600
???

198
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Hi.

199
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,700
Hi.

200
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,800
You okay?

201
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,300
Not really.

202
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,000
This is probably the wrong thing
to say, but i'm happy to see ya.

203
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,800
You sounded really scared
when you called me this morning.

204
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,400
Then you didn't show up.

205
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,000
I thought maybe you were having
second thoughts about me.

206
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,200
No, not at all. Just... 

207
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,300
really confused.

208
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,500
Yeah, me, too. I-I thought
we were being careful.

209
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,300
Well, i wasn't careful enough,
it seems.

210
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,200
I'm not pregnant,

211
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,000
Just naive.

212
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,700
I can't believe...
i believed you.

213
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,700
Don't worry.

214
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,600
You're safe, for now.

215
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,000
I-I wanted to give you
the opportunity to fix things,

216
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,400
To prove you're not
who you probably are.

217
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,000
Listen, you have to know
how sorry i am.

218
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,500
I don't know what you are right
now except a liar and a thief,

219
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,600
But you can change one of those
by giving the money back.

220
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,100
I can't do that.

221
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,700
Gabriel, why...

222
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,900
if you're just using me,
why--Why come back?

223
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,500
Why--Why act like
you care about me now?

224
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,800
You're not leaving my hotel
until you repay your investors.

225
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,800
It's your choice.

226
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,900
Either you hand over the money

227
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,700
Or we hand you over to the feds.

228
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,400
You have to believe me.
I would if i could,

229
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,900
B-But i don't have the money.

230
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,200
Poppy lifton does.

231
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,600
oh, daniel.

232
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,100
You just missed everyone.

233
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,300
Jenny said something about Going to
an exhibit at the fashion institute,

234
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,200
And your father pulled eric
away, all very mysterious.

235
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,400
You all right?

236
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,200
Uh, no.

237
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,400
No. I mean, yeah.
No, i'm not.

238
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Well, there's clearly
something on your mind.

239
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,300
Well, serena asked me
not to say anything.

240
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,400
Oh, that's my least favorite
sentence. Start talking.

241
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,200
I think she's wrong not to say anything.
I--She doesn't know how serious this is,

242
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,000
Or if she does, i mean,
she thinks she can handle it,

243
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,100
and she really can't.

244
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,300
Well, i'm sure if it's important,
She'll forgive you for breaking her trust.

245
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Yeah.

246
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,300
Uh...

247
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,000
gabriel is a con artist.
His--His investment was a scam.

248
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,300
?? Himself,
including my dad's.

249
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,700
Oh, my god.

250
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,500
Yeah. Uh, serena thinks she can somehow
sweet-Talk him Into giving everything back,

251
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,300
but i mean, r--Seriously,

252
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,200
I-I don't think Blair and chuck can
scheme their way out of this one.

253
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,700
I thought about calling
the cops,

254
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,900
???

255
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,200
No. No, no, no. You did
the right thing by telling me.

256
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,300
The last thing we need is
the authorities to implicate serena ??

257
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,400
Yeah, i don't want that either,

258
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,400
but how do i tell my dad
That he got conned ???

259
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,200
You don't,
and you don't need to worry.

260
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,500
I'll take care of it.

261
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,900
Honestly, i was kind
of hoping you'd say that.

262
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,400
Just do me a favor and don't say
anything to anyone.

263
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,800
We don't need to make this
Any more complicated ???

264
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,200
Yeah. I just want you to do
what you people do.

265
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,100
Get my dad's money back.

266
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,700
Thank you.

267
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,000
You know, poppy's got
the rich friends...

268
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,900
who invite her to parties, ??? her
expensive clothes To wear for photographs,

269
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,900
Exes who've given her
some awfully nice presents.

270
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,700
In other words,
she's a "faux-Cialite."

271
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,500
I met her
at a mercedes launch party.

272
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,300
The faux-Cialite ball.

273
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,100
I tried enticing her into investing In
communication satellites for third world countries.

274
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,000
She tried enticing me into
making her The next mrs. Edwards.

275
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,800
It turns out i was awfully good At
getting folks to give me their money.

276
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,900
I just wasn't so good
at investing it.

277
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,600
Hence no wi-Fi for the poor
african children.

278
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,700
You know, i had to give
my investors something,

279
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,300
So i brought on new investors
to pay off the old investors.

280
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,800
- And then those investors--
- We know the rest. It's called a ponzi scheme.

281
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,000
Serena, i swear to you,

282
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,800
In the beginning,
you were just a mark.

283
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,700
And your mom--Bart bass' widow--

284
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,800
Was gonna be our big score.

285
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,300
But then my...

286
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,000
Then my feelings for you
got in the way of that.

287
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,500
So how did poppy end up
with all the money?

288
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,600
It was always business
for us.

289
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,600
As soon as realized that we were
both just playing rich,

290
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,200
I shared my plans with her, And
she shared her society connections.

291
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,000
When we hit our number,

292
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,300
i was gonna disappear,
And she was gonna stay behind

293
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:41,000
And just be another rich society
gal that i took advantage of.

294
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,100
Then you called me
this morning.

295
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,300
She thought you made me.

296
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,800
Smart girl.

297
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,600
Yeah. She said
we had to end it now.

298
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,100
She offered to buy me out
so i could leave.

299
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,200
She emptied the bank account
and never showed up.

300
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Instead, she went to your hotel room
And blamed the entire thing on you.

301
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,200
And i should've
just left town...

302
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,500
but i couldn't go
without seeing you again.

303
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,300
I'm afraid the only chance you
have Of getting your money back...

304
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,700
is finding poppy lifton.

305
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,300
This is taking too long. 

306
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,200
- I'm going to get a cup of coffee.
- Wait. No, don't leave me alone with her.

307
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,400
Well,
come and talk with me.

308
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,400
Oh, or stay with me
and talk.

309
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,200
Look, blair, everyone else has
forgiven me. I'm just waiting on you.

310
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,800
Everyone who? 

311
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,400
And besides,some thing ??

312
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,100
god will help me Find a way
to earn your forgiveness.

313
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,300
Oh, it looks like he answers
my prayers faster than yours.

314
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,000
chuck, what happened?

315
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,600
We've got the wrong guy.

316
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,000
Believe it or not,
the puppeteer is poppy.

317
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,100
Poppy?

318
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,800
Thank you
for actually coming.

319
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,900
Nobody believed
that you really would.

320
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,800
As much as you don't believe me, 

321
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,700
you're the only girl Who was ever
worth waking a priest up for.

322
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,900
I really did fall for you.

323
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,500
Well, not enough, it seems.

324
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
The money was
more important,

325
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,400
- Listen, serena--
- Gabriel, you should go.

326
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,400
Where's he going?

327
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,000
My p.I. Hasn't confirmed
his story yet, 

328
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,100
?? he's still a crook.E,

329
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,800
He's not the one we need,
And besides,

330
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,400
if we really need to find him,
I don't think ??

331
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,900
But why would poppy stay in town
after what she did?

332
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,900
Well, she has to if she's gonna
play the victim.

333
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,600
???
Sgabriel fooled her, too.K

334
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,200
She wants money.

335
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,600
All we need to provide is
?? She can get it from.

336
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,700
Except she knows all of us.

337
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,000
She doesn't know all of us.

338
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,400
What?

339
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,200
No. Unh-Unh.

340
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,000
Lying is also a sin. I will not
perjure myself In front of the lord.

341
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,800
We'll see about that.

342
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,300
<i>Looks like georgina's
losing her religion...</i>

343
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,300
<i>???</i>

344
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,200
Here are the names
and amounts

345
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,400
Of the residents who invested eswith
mr. Edwards-- If that's his real name.

346
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Oh, i'm sorry, bruce. I know this
goes beyond your usual duties.

347
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,700
Bass business uslly does.

348
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,400
Hey. You keep calling.
Is everything okay?

349
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,100
If you'll excuse us
just a moment...

350
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,100
i know all about
gabriel's scheme,

351
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,100
And frankly, i'm disappointed
that you did not come to me.

352
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,900
Dan?

353
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,300
I'm--I'm sorry, mom.
I was gonna tego you and then...

354
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,500
i can't believe
he told you.

355
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,900
Well, he obviously sees the situation and
my role in it Much more clearly than you do.

356
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,300
Well, it is a mess,
but--But it's--It's my mess,

357
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,800
- And i'm gonna fix it.
- You will do no such thing.

358
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,500
Those goes far beyond
bad taste in boyfriends.

359
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
But even you encouraged me
to be with him.

360
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,200
If word gets out about this,
all anyone will ever think

361
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
When they hear the name
"serena van der woodsen"

362
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,600
Is how you helped scam
your friends and family

363
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,800
Out of hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

364
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,700
I know. I know,
and i feel terrible.

365
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,700
That's i'm gonna get
everything back. I have a plan.

366
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,200
Ah, well, don't be naive.

367
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,000
the madoff people will be in court
for years And never see a dime.

368
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,300
The only plan is for me
to quietly tell everyone

369
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,600
That the deal didn't work out
and pay them back myself.

370
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,800
- But what about poppy?
- What about her?

371
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,700
She was behind all of this.
She can't just get away with it.

372
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,200
Yes, she can, and especially if it
means That your name stays out of it.

373
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,000
This is an adult scandal.

374
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,200
And the adult thing to do is
for me to pay everyone back

375
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,300
And for you to do
absolutely nothing.

376
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,800
Now let it go.

377
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,800
Am i understood?

378
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
Yeah.

379
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,300
okay, bruce.

380
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Where were we here?

381
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,300
Well, we've been over
all the investors except rufus.

382
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,300
Well, how about
we handle his payout

383
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,700
A little differently?

384
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,100
Uh-Oh. You don't really
seem all that excited.

385
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,100
No, the ring is amazing, And i-I
think it's great you want to marry my mom.

386
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,200
I just want to make sure
you're prepared.

387
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,800
Well, ??

388
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,900
So has she--Four times.

389
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,100
Ah, those guys weren't right for her.

390
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,400
That's definitely true, but my
mom can be a little crazy, too.

391
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,700
And i-I love her.
I... i-I just--

392
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,000
I just don't want you to
forget where she came from.

393
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,600
Trust me.
I know the family,

394
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,800
And your mother is
nothing like her mother.

395
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,500
And i'm totally up
for the wild ride

396
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,600
That is lily rhodes
van der woodsen bass et cetera.

397
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,000
Well, welcome ???

398
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,100
So have you thought about
how you're gonna propose?

399
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,700
I mean, klaus with a "k"
did it with a blimp,

400
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,600
"C"-Claus did it on--On top of a pyramid,
Although she didn't say yes to that.

401
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,000
But, uh, you have the bar set
pretty high.
Sure. Uh, but, um...

402
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
???

403
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,700
yeah. Yeah.
I have lots of ideas.

404
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,500
Come on, g.

405
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,700
Don't you miss dior?
Prada?

406
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,500
Looking fabulous?

407
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,800
I mean, for you?

408
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,700
Jesus loves me as i am.

409
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,100
He would love you
more with some styling.

410
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,100
Think of the fun you used to have
Pretending to be sarah and svetlana,

411
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,100
Slipping people roofies,

412
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,800
Outing them to their
unsuspecting parents at dinner.

413
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,900
Those things don't call to me
anymore, blair.

414
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,300
Look, i made a choice.

415
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,400
I let go of the evil So i can
find love and happiness with the good.

416
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,200
I know it sounds dull, but it's
actually ???

417
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,600
can't you understand?

418
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,200
More than you know.

419
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,300
I gave up my old wayen
i let jesus take the wheel.

420
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,600
That is a carrie underwood song,
not a life choice.

421
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,800
I'm sorry,

422
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,800
But i can't help you
if it goes against my beliefs.

423
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,900
But...

424
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,100
when you look at it,

425
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,800
Jesus drove you here. Right?

426
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,200
Actually, i believe
his name was jesus.

427
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,600
Not in the cab--In your
country-Western way of life.

428
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,300
Actually, i believe
his name was jesus.

429
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,600
Not in the cab--In your country-
Western way of life.

430
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,300
You said god would help you
find a way to earn my forgiveness.

431
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,800
Here it is.

432
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,800
So my amends would be
to entrap poppy lifton,

433
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,500
Get the money back that she stole
And destroy her in the process?

434
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,400
Exactly. If you
cut revenge out of the bible,

435
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,000
There's not even enough pages
to make a pamphlet.

436
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,300
And they shall know
???

437
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,000
When i shall
lay my vengeance on them."

438
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,400
How'd you know my favorite passage?

439
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,100
Hey, s.

440
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,500
My mom wants us
to call off the plan.

441
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,300
What? No. Do you know
how much work this exorcism was?

442
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,900
It's gonna take days for dorota
to reorganize my closet.

443
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,400
I don't like it either.
I'm just telling you,

444
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,900
She wants to take care
of things herself

445
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,600
And she wants us
to leave poppy out of it.

446
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,700
Poppy is it.

447
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,900
She's so evil she makes The old
georgina look like the new georgina.

448
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,100
serena?

449
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,800
I-I have to go.

450
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,100
Just put the plan on hold

451
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,800
And do not do anything
until i call you back, okay?

452
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,900
S., wait!

453
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,200
I mean it, blair.

454
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,200
???

455
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,200
??

456
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,600
Oh. Poppy came by
to see how we were doing

457
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,000
After all the terrible drama
this morning.

458
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,800
I mean, the money part was bad,
But i just felt like such an idiot.

459
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,200
I thought he loved me.

460
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,100
Obviously you understand that.

461
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,500
Obviously.

462
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,700
poppy also told me that she's
going to miami tomorrow night.

463
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,900
Yeah. I have a cousin down there,

464
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,500
And i just thought,
if i have to feel like a fool,

465
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,400
I might as well do it with a tan.

466
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,100
oh, uh, you might want to check.
I think you have a little...

467
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,200
oh. Oh. Excuse me.

468
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,900
Yes.

469
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,600
What are you doing having tea
and smiling at her?

470
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,300
We should lock the doors
and call the police.

471
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,300
We already discussed it.

472
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,900
The adult thing to do is
to let it and her disappear.

473
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,100
She's not disappearing.
She's going to miami,

474
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,600
Where she's gonna do the exact
same thing to new people.

475
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,500
Well, we can only hope that those
people Will be smarter than we were.

476
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,700
Sorry. My dad's not home.
Can i take a message?

477
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,100
just let him know The paperwork
from his recent investment's on its way.

478
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,600
Uh, there--
There must be a mistake.

479
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,200
I was told that investment
didn't happen.

480
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,500
No, sir. He should begin to receive
dividends In about six weeks.

481
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,200
I don't care what my mom says.
Poppy lifton must pay.

482
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,500
I knew you would come
to your senses.

483
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,800
Ta-Da!

484
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,000
Hello.

485
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,400
Sherilyn phillips.

486
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,500
My daddy's got a piece
of the oil sands up in alberta--

487
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,500
A piece the size of florida.

488
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,400
I'm so excited to meet
my first new york friend For tomorrow.

489
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,200
Maybe you know her?
Poppy lifton?

490
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,000
???

491
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
What do you think?

492
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,700
I sense aspiration,

493
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,500
Yearning, striving
to be accepted, But then...

494
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
there's this appealing counter
note Of sincerity and optimism.

495
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,900
This is the story of a young girl

496
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,400
Who is enjoying her first taste
Of the spoils of dirty oil.

497
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,300
It's perfection.

498
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,600
Well, there's no detail too small

499
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,600
To make sure poppy lifton
goes down hard.

500
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,200
And you still think
this is a better idea

501
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,300
Than just calling the cops?

502
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,800
It's better than my mother's version
Of sleeping with the enemy.

503
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
This will work.

504
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,900
Georgina has a recording device
in her handbag.

505
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,600
Once we get poppy on tape
Talking money,

506
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,300
we can blackmail her
Into handing over the cash.

507
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,000
Yeah, and if poppy got arrested,
she would never Give up the money,

508
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,100
and as annoyed as i am
With dan right now,

509
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,500
it is his college tuition.

510
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,700
Okay, but how do we even gonna ?????

511
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,900
She thinks gabriel took the fall.

512
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,600
All she's worried about right now 

513
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,300
is party invitations And keeping
a front row seat at bryant park.

514
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,800
And she's greedy.

515
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:30,700
Hello?

516
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,500
Hey, you said the gabriel deal
was a scam,

517
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,000
So why is my dad getting a call
about future dividends?

518
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,500
I don't know.
???

519
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,700
You seem to like
to talk to her these days.

520
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,600
come on. ????

521
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,200
I mean, it's not exactly
fair of you to ask me

522
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,300
To trust the return of
my tuition to blair and chuck.

523
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,000
I told you i would take care of it,

524
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,600
And that's what i'm doing right now.

525
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,300
I hope you don't expect me
to drink alcohol in this scheme.

526
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,800
It's the russian tea room.
???

527
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,000
Serena, what are you doing?

528
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,900
i'm in the elevator.
I'm losing you. Sorry.

529
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,100
Eric said lily's at barney's,

530
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,400
So we should have
at least a couple hours.

531
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,000
I hope she likes all of this.

532
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,800
Aw, dad, you're nervous.
That's so cute!

533
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,600
Hey, do not call your father cute.

534
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,000
Dad, lily's gonna love the proposal.

535
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,900
I hope so.

536
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,900
It's not exactly fireworks
over the eiffel tower or a g5.

537
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,400
No, but you got
her favorite flowers And..

538
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,500
tracked down her favorite wine,

539
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,900
You bought bespoke chocolates
And you made all her favorite foods.

540
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,300
Although i still think that

541
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,100
spareribs and scallops
Are kinda gross together.

542
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,400
If you're trying to make me
feel better, you're failing.

543
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,600
Look, all i'm saying is that
big proposals are great, sure,

544
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,300
But yours is something more important.

545
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,900
It shows that you really know her
And you love her

546
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,500
for who she is.

547
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,800
You're right. I do.

548
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,000
quick. Buy me five minutes.

549
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,900
Yeah, i'm on it.

550
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,800
- Hi.
- Oh, jenny.

551
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,900
- I wasn't expecting to see you.
- Lily. Uh, yeah, i know.

552
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,100
I, um, wanted you to--
Here i'll take those--

553
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,500
Show me that marchesa dress
that you wore last week.

554
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,900
I loved the zippers.

555
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,700
Hey. We need to talk.

556
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,200
Can't we talk inside?

557
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,900
We need to talk about blair.

558
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,200
Trouble in paradise?

559
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,900
Listen, a couple days ago,
you told me you were done with her.

560
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,500
And then you went
and you did everything you could

561
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,000
To try and get close
to her again.

562
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,900
If you have a problem with
???

563
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,600
Maybe you should ask serena not to
get herself Into so much trouble.

564
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,300
You know what
i couldn't figure out is

565
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,100
Why you would go out of your way
to lie to me about how you felt.

566
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,100
Then i realized,
you're not lying to me.

567
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,500
You're lying to yourself.

568
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,300
That's a lovely theory
you've concocted, nathaniel.

569
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,500
You should have it published.
Now if you'll excuse me...

570
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,600
no, no, no. Look,
you had your shot, and you blew it.

571
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,600
So why start toying with her again?

572
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,900
I mean, if you want her,
then man up and tell her.

573
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,600
Otherwise you gotta cut her loose.

574
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,400
You gotta cut her loose, And you
gotta do it for real this time, man,

575
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,700
Because i want her.

576
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Bella's so in love with him,
even though he's a vampire.

577
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,300
Maybe it's because
he's a vampire. I don't know.

578
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,200
But the thing is, his family
doesn't suck the blood,

579
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,500
So it makes her feel safer,
but the problem is...Is that edward,

580
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,400
- the more he falls in love with her,
- Jenny

581
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,200
The more wants--
Jenny, ex--

582
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,800
Just one minute, jenny.

583
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,700
- Okay.
- Okay. Hello?

584
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,600
Yes. Okay.
Um. I'm gonna--

585
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,000
Oh. Okay.

586
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,600
Thank you. Bye.

587
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,500
Hi. I'm sorry, daniel.
What--What was your question?

588
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,200
Well, i got nowhere
with serena on this,

589
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,000
So maybe you have an answer for me.

590
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,800
Why is my dad getting calls
about dividends?

591
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,400
Did you--Did you
not get his money back?

592
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,500
Um... i did.

593
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,600
I put it in a very safe mutual fund

594
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,800
That will pay him dividends each month.

595
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,000
Okay. Then, uh, then what is
serena still taking care of

596
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,100
At the russian tea room right now?

597
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,300
Hello?

598
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,000
Serena, whatever you're doing,
i need you to stop right now.

599
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,800
She can't just get away with it.

600
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,300
You can smile at poppy
all you want, mom,

601
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,100
But i'm not like that.
It's not right.

602
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,600
Well, i will not tolerate You deciding
what is right in this situation.

603
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,800
I am your mother, And i am
telling you to stop this instant.

604
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,400
It is nonnegotiable.

605
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,300
Serena, do you hear me?

606
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,500
I'm sorry, mom.
I have to go.

607
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,500
Serena, don't you dare.

608
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,400
Hi. It's lily bass.

609
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,500
Well, find him.

610
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,800
I need to speak with him right now.

611
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,800
???

612
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,400
??

613
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,500
???
- They say that numbers don't lie,

614
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,300
And money talks.

615
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,900
Hi. Are you sherilyn?

616
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,900
I'm poppy.

617
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,200
Poppy, it's so nice to meet you.

618
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,400
????

619
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,600
I'm just loving it here.

620
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,600
Are you a carrie?

621
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,100
I'm a charlotte.

622
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,100
A carrie?

623
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,200
Um, yeah.

624
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,100
I thought so.

625
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
Did you see poppy's here?

626
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,600
I did. Georgina's going to text me
As soon as she starts talking money.

627
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Great.

628
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,700
You look like
you could use a cocktail.

629
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,100
You're too late.

630
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,400
Wow.

631
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,800
What?

632
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,800
That's the first true laugh
i've gotten out of you in a while.

633
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,300
Listen, blair--

634
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,200
No. Me first.

635
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,100
Nate's waiting for me
to give him an answer.

636
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,500
I heard.

637
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,000
Don't you want to know
what's stopping me?

638
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,400
I can't answer his question while
i'm waiting for you to answer mine,

639
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,700
The one i asked you forever ago...

640
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,000
what are we, chuck?

641
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,100
Blair...

642
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,400
last fall you said
we couldn't be together.

643
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,000
And i believed you.

644
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,500
But every time i try to move on,
you're right there,

645
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
- Acting like--
- Acting like what?

646
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,300
Like...

647
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,400
maybe you just want me to be
as unhappy as you are.

648
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,300
I would never wish
that on anyone.

649
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,200
I want you to be happy.

650
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,300
Then look down deep

651
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,200
Into the soul i know you have...

652
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,100
and tell me if
what you feel for me is real...

653
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,400
or if it's just a game.

654
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,600
If it's real...

655
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,100
we'll figure it out,

656
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,500
All of us.

657
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,400
But if it's not...

658
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,300
then please, chuck,

659
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,300
Just let me go.

660
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,800
it's just a game.

661
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,100
i hate to lose.

662
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,000
You're free to go.

663
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,500
Thank you.

664
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,500
Chuck, why did you just do that?

665
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,100
Because i love her.

666
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,000
And i can't make her happy.

667
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,700
New york is full of people
doing such amazing things.

668
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,800
Who knew you could bring wireless
to third world countries?

669
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,100
Mm.

670
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,600
What a great job.

671
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,900
Yeah. It's--It's really more
of a passion than a job.

672
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,800
I mean, it gives so much
to the children.

673
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,100
Of course.

674
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,700
I mean, they can look at faraway places
and--and read bible stories.

675
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,400
And oh! Well, they can
download kirk cameron movies.

676
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,700
yeah.

677
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,800
You know...

678
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,600
i'd really love to be
a part of something like that.

679
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,100
My father was really hoping i'd find
something philanthropic to do 

680
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,700
while i'm down here.

681
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
I mean, you're such a great girl.

682
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,800
Look, if you can get me a payment today,
I'll find a way to get you in.

683
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
really?

684
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,900
That would be amazing.

685
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,100
I-I can't wait to help the children.

686
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,300
Um, let me just call the bank
to set up a wire transfer.

687
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,200
Oh, um, i'm sorry.
Just because of the time crunch,

688
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,800
I'm afraid i'm only gonna
be able to accept cash.

689
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,900
Mm.

690
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,000
Hey, the police just pulled up.

691
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,400
The police? I thought chuck
was calling his p.I.

692
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,900
- Wait. Where is he?
- He just left.

693
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,100
Believe it or not, but as long as
georgina has poppy on tape,

694
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,500
We can let the cops arrest her.

695
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,000
Okay, well, text georgina.
Make sure she's ready.

696
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,800
I'm gonna go talk to the police.

697
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,800
Um...

698
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,200
well, this is all the money
i have for... emergencies,

699
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,300
But if you let me text my father,

700
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,400
I'm--I'm sure he can
arrange for something more.

701
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,000
No, no. It's okay.
It's a great start.

702
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,000
Okay.

703
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,900
Police here.
All set?

704
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,500
God intended for us to meet.

705
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm just glad i was
able to get you in.

706
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,100
- So i'll call you later.
- Oh, for cosmos!

707
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,700
Yeah. Okay.

708
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,400
Hi. Um, chuck bass had to leave,

709
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,900
But the woman he called you
about is inside.

710
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I can take you.

711
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,000
- Serena van der woodsen?
-Yeah, yeah. That's right.

712
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,300
You're under arrest.

713
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,800
What? Wait. No, no, no.
There--There's been a mistake.

714
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,500
- It's poppy lifton that--
- What is taking so long? Serena, t--

715
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,400
- Blair. Blair, tell them.
- Oh, my god!

716
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,900
- What are you doing?
- You have the wrong girl!

717
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,200
I don't think so.

718
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,700
Hey. What's going on?
Why are they taking serena?

719
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,700
- Serena, it's okay.
We'll f--We'll figure it out.
- Excuse me, sir?

720
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,000
- Blair, call chuck. Call chuck.
- Serena, it's okay.

721
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,700
- Blair, what's going--
- Your plan was a rousing success.

722
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,600
So they arrested her?

723
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,900
If by "her," you mean serena,
the answer is yes.

724
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,000
Wait. I don't understand.

725
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,000
- Why would they arrest serena?
- You should know.

726
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,900
Pretending to find jesus to take us
all down--It borders on brilliant.

727
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,200
What are you talking about? I...

728
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,100
where's poppy? I gave her
the camp's bible money.

729
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,100
Oh, nice touch.

730
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,200
But you texted me "all set,"

731
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,400
And--And poppy was asking me
for a down payment,

732
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,500
And all i had was the money
my camp gave me toveuy bibles.

733
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,500
You expect me to believe that
after all you've done?

734
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,800
Your stupid clothes and your bible
quotes don't fool anyone.

735
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,400
You're evil.

736
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,500
I know it, you know it,
and god knows it.

737
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,900
But i didn't do anything wrong.

738
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,700
I will never forgive you
for what you' done

739
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
And neither ll jesus.

740
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,300
Rufus, i hope you weren't
waiting too long.

741
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,100
What's this?

742
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,300
Where did you find that?

743
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,500
It's a list of
gabriel's investors.

744
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,400
Oh, what beautiful lilies.

745
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,200
With bags of money matching
each of their investments?

746
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,900
what's going on here, lily?

747
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,900
Well, if you must know,

748
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,800
The investment didn't work out, 

749
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,800
so i'm simply taking care of
getting everyone's money back to them.

750
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,800
How about your different plan for me?

751
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,800
Rufus, this really isn't a big deal.

752
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,900
You were planning on giving me money
every month behind my back.

753
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,200
Do you have any idea
how humiliating that is?

754
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,100
Well, i wasn't trying
to humiliate you.

755
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
I was just trying to help you.

756
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,100
You had to know
i'd never go for it.

757
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,700
Well, you should.

758
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,100
Do you know how hard it is for me

759
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,900
to watch you agonize over not
being able to send dan to yale

760
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,200
When i could very easily help you,
if you would just let me?

761
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,500
You are not putting this on me.

762
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,900
I have raised my kids
just fine without your help.

763
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,600
Um, i'm sorry.
I have to take this.

764
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,600
I don't understand. You were
supposed to arrest poppy lifton.

765
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,500
We have her on tape committing fraud.

766
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,800
- Fraud?
- Yes.

767
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,100
thank you. I-I don't understand
what you thought you were arresting me for.

768
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,700
Theft.

769
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,000
What? No. No,
i-I didn't steal that.

770
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,000
That was my great grandmother's.
You can call my mother, lily bass.

771
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,300
- She will tell you.
This is a huge mistake.
- Lily bass?

772
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,400
- Yes.
- She called it in.

773
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,000
Thank you, detective.
I'll be down in a bit.

774
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,600
What was that?

775
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,900
Um, serena's in
a little trouble again.

776
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,400
- Is she okay?
- She's be arrested.

777
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,200
Oh, no. W--Come on.
I'll go with you.

778
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,900
No, uh, i'm not going just yet.

779
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,400
- I'm sorry. I don't think i understand--
- I had her arrested.

780
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,500
Look, i know how that sounds,
but i had no choice.

781
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,400
This coming from the same woman who wouldn't even
let me put jenny in the back of a squad car?

782
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,100
I am not a monster, rufus.

783
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,300
I'm not gonna let her sit
and rot behind bars,

784
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,600
But i needed to remove her
from the situation

785
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,700
- So she'd have time to think things through.
- So you called the police on her?

786
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,900
Yes, so that i could drop the charges,
and in a few weeks,

787
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Everyone would forget
get ever happened.

788
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,600
Are you hearing yourself?

789
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,200
I asked her to stop,
and she purposefully disobeyed me.

790
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,400
look...

791
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,800
this was the only way
that i could protect her.

792
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,200
From what, lil?

793
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,700
From creating a scandal,

794
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,800
From ruining her future

795
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,200
And everything that
she's worked for,

796
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,100
Embarrassing me...

797
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,800
you just sounded exactly
like your mother.

798
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,200
I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

799
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,100
What is all of this?

800
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,000
S that, um...

801
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,000
was a big mistake.

802
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,100
Where is she?

803
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,600
She's inside, but they won't
let us talk to her.

804
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,900
We'll see about that.

805
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,200
You called him?

806
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,000
Of course i did. He's her brother.

807
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,700
You have nothing to worry about
with chuck anymore.

808
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,900
Did he-- Did he tell you that?

809
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,700
He gave me my answer,

810
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,500
And you deserve yours.

811
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,600
I don't think we should
move in together.

812
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,400
Me neither.

813
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,300
Th--

814
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,300
Then why...

815
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,400
look, i-I just-- I'm sorry.

816
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,900
I-I was--I was using the apartment
to force our issues,

817
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,300
And it's just--
It's too big of a step. I'm sorry.

818
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,500
Well...

819
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:59,300
perhaps a more suitable step
would be for you to ask me to prom.

820
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,800
hello?

821
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,200
Hello, blair.

822
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,100
Georgina?

823
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,100
You don't sound like yourself.

824
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,200
That's funny, because i feel
more like myself than ever.

825
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,100
Where are you?

826
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,300
Taking care of
what you obviously couldn't.

827
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,400
I don't think jesus
would approve of that.

828
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:27,100
Well, you can tell jesus
that the bitch is back.

829
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,500
follow that car.

830
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,400
Oh, no. We warned you no good would
come from spinning a wicked web.

831
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,100
You just end up all tangled
in your own lies...

832
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,300
Oh, hey. How'd it go?

833
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,900
Did she love it?

834
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,800
Please, uh, return this for me.

835
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,600
And the more you twist,
the tighter the trap.

836
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,500
I need you to dig up
what dirt you can

837
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,100
He officers of the 55th precinct.

838
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,600
Detective sanders? Yes.
My grandfather, william van der bilt,

839
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,700
said you'd be able to
help me get some information.

840
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,600
Serena's mom gave her that bracelet.
It's been in the family for years.

841
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,700
She couldn't have stolen it.

842
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,800
Until you're trapped in
a prison of your own making.

843
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,100
Smile for the camera, s.

844
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,200
X.O.X.O., gossip girl.
