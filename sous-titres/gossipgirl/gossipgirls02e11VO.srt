1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,460
Gossip girl here...

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:04,050
Your once and only source into the

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,430
Scandalous lives of manhattan'slite.

4
00:00:05,568 --> 00:00:07,167
I like to date more
than one person at once.

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,015
You're free to see other people, too.

6
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:11,234
Did you hire someone
to look into my past?

7
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:14,901
Do you have a lily bass dossier?

8
00:00:14,934 --> 00:00:17,701
- I want to see it.
- I won't put my name on a piece of paper

9
00:00:17,734 --> 00:00:20,367
- Condoning who you've become.
- Then i'll just have to find another way.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,467
Well, you have one other option.

11
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:25,701
- You could file a suit to become emancipated.
- You mean divorce my parents?

12
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,367
The captain is being charged
with embezzlement and fraud.

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,367
- You're skipping town?
- I'm gonna be a much better father to you

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,834
From dominica than i will be from jail.

15
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:50,334
For the rest of the country,
thanksgiving is when families

16
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:52,901
Come together to give thanks,
but on the upper east side,

17
00:00:52,934 --> 00:00:55,400
The holiday thankfully
returns to its roots...

18
00:00:55,434 --> 00:00:58,501
Lying, manipulation and betrayal.

19
00:00:58,534 --> 00:01:01,400
And from what we hear,
just like the indians,

20
00:01:01,434 --> 00:01:04,400
Someone else is being
pushed out of their home.

21
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:05,900
Not only are cyrus'
moving boxes everywhere,

22
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:09,700
- But so are his annoying relatives.
- But they can't be that bad.

23
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:10,822
Aaron always talks about his nana.

24
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:12,968
Oh, sylvia? You know, she
kissed me on the cheek.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,968
She left a big, orange lipstick mark.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,467
It looked like i'd been spray-Tanned.

27
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:19,801
And cyrus' nephew spent
the morning talking to me

28
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:22,834
About corn, grain of the future.

29
00:01:22,868 --> 00:01:25,801
And his sister asked me
to go shopping with her.

30
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:28,534
Oh, that's sweet. At century 21.

31
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:30,234
Ugh. The horror.

32
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:32,934
But even though daddy isn't coming,

33
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,667
I'm determined to have

34
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,901
The perfect thanksgiving
i didn't get last year.

35
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:39,567
You're still gonna help me
make his famous pie tomorrow?

36
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:41,567
Yeah, but i can only
stay for a couple hours.

37
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,867
Aaron is coming to meet my
family before thanksgiving dinner.

38
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:46,601
And how do you plan to introduce him?

39
00:01:46,634 --> 00:01:49,801
"Mom, you d.V.R. 'Big
love.' This is aaron,

40
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:51,801
"And he's just like bill paxton,

41
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:54,067
Only younger and with scruff."

42
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,067
I'm serious. The serena i
know would never want to share

43
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,334
A guy she really liked with anyone else.

44
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:01,334
Well, i'll admit, it's been hard.

45
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:04,334
I like him enough that i
don't want to date anyone else.

46
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:07,434
And you can't get the prize
if you don't compete, right?

47
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:10,634
There's so many things
wrong with that sentence.

48
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:13,767
Here comes your ghost of
boyfriends past to haunt me.

49
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,801
Please try to be civil.

50
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:17,968
Okay. Pfft.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hey, have either of you seen
jenny? Oh, if she's hiding from you,

52
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:23,700
She has better taste
than i thought. I tried.

53
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:26,367
My dad has been calling her cell,

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,667
And he's been trying
her friend agnes' place,

55
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:31,234
And she's just not returning
any of his messages.

56
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:33,467
I was looking for eric.

57
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:34,734
The headmaster said
he left early, so...

58
00:02:34,735 --> 00:02:36,135
Well, she has been spending

59
00:02:36,168 --> 00:02:38,123
A lot of time with him
over at the apartment.

60
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:39,934
Look, if you see her, could you
please just tell her to call us back,

61
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:44,167
Because i would love this cold war
of theirs to end before the holidays.

62
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,934
- Speaking of, happy thanksgiving.
- You, too.

63
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,601
I'm gonna miss your dad's mashed
potatoes, but not the drama.

64
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:54,701
Yeah, well, this year's gonna
be a little quieter, i guess,

65
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:57,334
Especially if jenny doesn't show.

66
00:02:57,367 --> 00:03:01,400
I guess i'll see you
after the break. Yeah. Bye.

67
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:02,767
Bye.

68
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:06,300
Oh, sorry.

69
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:08,000
Not as sorry as i am.

70
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:12,934
Archibald, i haven't seen
you around here lately.

71
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:14,434
Why do you care?

72
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:17,567
Oh, i don't. If you're not
with the humphreys anymore,

73
00:03:17,601 --> 00:03:20,067
Obviously things are
looking up, which is too bad.

74
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,067
I kind of liked watching you slum it.

75
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,400
I thought it would teach you
who your real friends were.

76
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:27,667
Well, i guess it has.

77
00:03:30,901 --> 00:03:33,601
I need to be sure you understand
what emancipation means.

78
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:34,918
I do. I've been researching it.

79
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:37,100
She's made me watch
"irreconcilable differences, "

80
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,868
Like, 15 times.

81
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:41,234
Once you file, the state opens up

82
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:43,400
An investigation into your family.

83
00:03:43,434 --> 00:03:46,267
There has to be proof
of parental neglect.

84
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,501
Just fill out these papers
authorizing the investigation.

85
00:03:48,534 --> 00:03:51,167
Once you sign them, your
parents will be notified.

86
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,167
Wait. They have to be notified?

87
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,667
Well, of course.

88
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:58,167
They need to know you no
longer want to be their child.

89
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:03,267
Okay. Thank you.

90
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,434
Let's go.

91
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:07,701
So what are you doing for your holiday?

92
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:09,534
I decided to pass

93
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:11,534
On joining my family at
the washoe reservation,

94
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,534
Where they're helping
to stage a protest.

95
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:16,534
And my plan is to hole
myself up in my studio,

96
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:18,033
Rent "berlin alexanderplatz"

97
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:20,467
And eat a frozen annie's
organic turkey dinner.

98
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:23,467
Oh! Well, god, you know, no one
enjoys a 16-Hour german movie

99
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:27,434
More than yours truly, but,
you could come here instead.

100
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,467
I don't really feel like seeing jenny.

101
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:32,300
Well, i'm pretty sure she's not coming,

102
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:36,234
So you can take her chair. I
didn't realize it was still that bad

103
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:38,167
Between her and your dad.

104
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,400
Where is she having
thanksgiving? With nate?

105
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:43,434
No, nate and jenny aren't
spending time together anymore.

106
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:45,434
So how about it?

107
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:47,567
A fassbinder and freezer-Free
thanksgiving at my place?

108
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:50,567
- Well, when you put it that way...
- I know.

109
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:52,567
Agnes' mother just told me that agnes is

110
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:54,767
On a modeling assignment in tokyo,

111
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:57,968
And she hasn't seen jenny
for a week. Then where is she?

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,719
I don't know. I think
i have to call the cops.

113
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:01,667
You know, when i asked
serena this afternoon,

114
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,300
She said that jenny's

115
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:05,501
Been spending a lot of time with eric.

116
00:05:05,534 --> 00:05:08,133
Eric! Serena! Charles! We're home!

117
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:11,133
So much for coming home a day early.

118
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:13,133
We should have stayed on necker island

119
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:15,934
With dick and bono. Right?

120
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,701
Is my daughter there?

121
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:21,901
Well, rufus, hello to you, too.

122
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:24,901
No, no one's here. Why would
you think your daughter would be?

123
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:27,100
Is she with eric? Well,
i certainly hope so.

124
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:29,968
I'm pretty sure she's
been with him all week.

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,968
What do you mean, all week?

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,467
What, you don't really
believe she's been staying...

127
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:41,534
I'm gonna call you right back.

128
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:44,534
It was nice of the roths to
let us stay at their place

129
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:46,033
While they're in aspen.

130
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:48,033
Very. If they hadn't offered to help,

131
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:50,534
I'm not sure what we would have done.

132
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:53,033
We don't have a lot
of options left, nate.

133
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:56,200
Yeah, i kind of noticed.

134
00:05:56,234 --> 00:06:00,868
But i'm hoping that is about to change.

135
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,534
Son, i missed you so much.

136
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,033
Just like nate archibald,

137
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:14,834
Gossip girl has a family
waiting for her today,

138
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:17,434
So although i'd love to stay and chat,

139
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm signing off until
after thanksgiving dinner...

140
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:25,467
Just in time for pie, coffee
and surveying the damage.

141
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:30,795
My life in dominica
is... well, it's good.

142
00:06:31,815 --> 00:06:33,067
We moved some money
offshore before i left,

143
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,267
Enough to get a house on the ocean.

144
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:36,920
Weather's always
perfect. People are nice.

145
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,934
I'm so happy you're living
it up in the caribbean

146
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:41,257
While we're squatting
with no heat in new york.

147
00:06:41,257 --> 00:06:42,700
Hear your father out, nate.

148
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:44,700
I want to make things better.

149
00:06:44,734 --> 00:06:47,834
I know how hard your life has
been because of what i did.

150
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:49,834
I can't turn back the clock,

151
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:53,334
But i can ask you to come live with me.

152
00:06:53,368 --> 00:06:55,800
All the money in the
world isn't worth it

153
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,244
Without the two of you to share it with.

154
00:06:57,245 --> 00:06:59,667
Mom, did you know about this?

155
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,667
Yes, and i'd like to go,

156
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,834
But only if you want to come, too.

157
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:05,934
Please, nate.

158
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,067
We can be a family again.

159
00:07:08,101 --> 00:07:11,101
All you have to do is say yes.

160
00:07:16,418 --> 00:07:18,792
I didn't know she was there until today.

161
00:07:18,793 --> 00:07:20,383
I called serena. She didn't even know.

162
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,567
Eric must have been
sneaking her in at night.

163
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,545
Let's just go wait for her.

164
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,490
I don't think that's such a good idea.

165
00:07:26,491 --> 00:07:28,175
The last time i saw
you and jenny together,

166
00:07:28,176 --> 00:07:30,567
It didn't go very well,
and you don't seem to have

167
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,101
- Changed your mind about anything.
- She's my daughter.

168
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:34,117
If i want to see her, you're
not gonna change my mind.

169
00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:35,912
I'm not trying to.

170
00:07:35,912 --> 00:07:37,533
It's just that i haven't seen jenny yet.

171
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,967
Let me talk to her, see
where her head is at.

172
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,001
If there's one thing i have
learned about teenage girls,

173
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:45,567
Is that sometimes they need someone

174
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,162
Outside of their family to talk to.

175
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:49,368
A-All that might be ue,
but it's thanksgiving.

176
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:50,610
Jenny needs to be with family.

177
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:52,633
She is. She's with mine.

178
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:55,867
Once you've calmed down,
and she's ready to talk,

179
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,267
I'll arrange a meeting.

180
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:02,334
Marshmallows.

181
00:08:02,368 --> 00:08:05,311
Jenny likes 'em on
her, sweet potatoes.

182
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,097
I'm so glad to have the house to myself.

183
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:13,526
Cyrus took my mother to
jean-Georges for dinner.

184
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,410
God knows why. Where's warren jeffs?

185
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,034
He's, making dinner for us,

186
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:21,958
Which would be completely
romantic and amazing,

187
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,013
Except when i asked
him where he was today,

188
00:08:24,014 --> 00:08:25,633
He said he was hanging
out with a friend.

189
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:28,134
I know i'm probably
being completely neurotic,

190
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:31,134
But ali could think of
was, was this friend a girl,

191
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:32,633
A girl he kisses?

192
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:35,633
A woman needs to be with a
man who thinks of only her.

193
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:38,633
Anything else is a nonstarter.
Tell him how you feel.

194
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,838
Dorota, more flour.

195
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:41,667
Are you baking already?

196
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,800
I thought we were supposed
to do that tomorrow.

197
00:08:43,834 --> 00:08:46,834
I needed a little tradition
of my own to keep me grounded.

198
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:49,767
It turns out the rose family
has a restaurant thanksgiving.

199
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,767
You know, b., the thing
about traditions is

200
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,101
You can make new ones. For all you know,

201
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,767
You could like his family dinner

202
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:57,401
- More than your own.
- Ready.

203
00:08:57,434 --> 00:08:59,567
Oh. That's...
that's my cue to go.

204
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,967
Remember, serena doesn't share.

205
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:04,234
Remember, blair should learn to.

206
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:09,126
- Bart, you're home early.
- So are you.

207
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:10,564
Chuck said he thought you were

208
00:09:10,564 --> 00:09:12,001
Going out with jonathan tonight.

209
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:15,067
Yeah, so did i.

210
00:09:19,403 --> 00:09:21,012
So how were things while we were away?

211
00:09:21,013 --> 00:09:23,500
Not so good.

212
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:26,468
I don't think it's
working out with jonathan.

213
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,324
What do you know about someone

214
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:34,288
At your school named ben shurn?

215
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:37,269
He's the,

216
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,949
The... the captain of
jonathan's swim team. Why?

217
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,821
Just... maybe you might
want to ask jonathan

218
00:09:41,822 --> 00:09:43,234
What he was doing monday night.

219
00:09:50,201 --> 00:09:53,754
You're home.

220
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:56,819
My plans for the evening
got held up at customs.

221
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,940
Your dad just insinuated

222
00:09:57,941 --> 00:10:00,500
That jonathan might
be dating someone else.

223
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,401
How and why would he know that?

224
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:06,234
He has a p.I. On retainer, like i do.

225
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:08,234
I get that for business,

226
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:11,067
But for family and friends
of family, it's just creepy.

227
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:14,067
Not to worry. Bart's people
are top-Notch and very discreet.

228
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:17,067
At our old place, he had this
safe with files on everybody,

229
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:19,468
From staff to senators.

230
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,984
When i was 13, i found the most

231
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:22,468
Amazing surveillance photos

232
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,334
Of gina, my hot italian au pair.

233
00:10:27,153 --> 00:10:29,044
Those photos... and
gina... changed my life.

234
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,600
Yeah, but what if i don't
want my life to change?

235
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:34,101
What else does he know?

236
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,703
How much do you want to find out?

237
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:44,167
This is so good.

238
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:47,386
But candles and home cooking?

239
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:48,964
What's with the romance?

240
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:50,667
Bound to give the girl the wrong idea.

241
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,234
Well, or the right one.

242
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:57,368
I've had an incredible time
with you these past few weeks.

243
00:10:57,401 --> 00:11:01,181
Honestly, you're
all i ever think of.

244
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:04,285
Really?

245
00:11:04,286 --> 00:11:05,829
Oh. I mean, that's flattering.

246
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,952
You're, of course, welcome
to see other people.

247
00:11:07,952 --> 00:11:09,934
That's your choice.

248
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:12,434
But, as of right now, this moment,

249
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:15,368
I'm officially a 1-Woman man.

250
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:19,274
Wow. A 1-Woman man?

251
00:11:19,275 --> 00:11:21,184
If... if i would have
known we were celebrating,

252
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:22,818
I would have brought
a bottle of champagne.

253
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:25,377
Well, actually, i'm... i'm
kind of glad you didn't.

254
00:11:25,378 --> 00:11:28,462
I also wanted to talk to you

255
00:11:28,463 --> 00:11:29,633
About the fact that, i'm sober.

256
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:32,657
Oh. I feel a lot better.

257
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:35,301
My... my work is a lot better
since i stopped drinking.

258
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:38,401
I just need to be around
people that are gonna keep me

259
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:42,101
On the right track, not tempt
me over to the dark side.

260
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,134
The dark side. Right.

261
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:46,900
Well, i used to party...

262
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:48,967
Every now and then.

263
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:52,028
No. No. But that...
that was so long ago.

264
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:53,783
So it's... it's,
you know,

265
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:57,029
E-Except for the occasional
celebratory glass of champagne,

266
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,884
I'm pretty much a teetotaler now.

267
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,234
So you can count on me.

268
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:05,334
- I'm... i'm... i'm the right girl
for the job. - Well, i figured.

269
00:12:05,368 --> 00:12:08,368
The kids need to tell us
things when they happen,

270
00:12:08,401 --> 00:12:11,368
Not after they get caught.
The only way to protect them is

271
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:14,368
To know what they're up to
at all times. Don't you agree?

272
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,050
Yes, but ithis case, it's complicated.

273
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,970
Well, i certainly
hope you grounded eric.

274
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,836
Well, not yet, but...
where are you off to?

275
00:12:21,837 --> 00:12:22,814
I just
have to get to...

276
00:12:22,815 --> 00:12:24,034
To go find jenny and
tell her that we know

277
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:25,767
She's been staying here?

278
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:29,267
How about you bring her back here?

279
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:32,834
Because i would love to talk to her.

280
00:12:41,934 --> 00:12:45,167
Blair, this is delicious.

281
00:12:45,168 --> 00:12:47,434
I must get the recipe.
But you know what?

282
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:51,567
The ratio of cinnamon
to nutmeg... not enough.

283
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,368
- Mother?
- Yes?

284
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:01,633
Why are you letting
cyrus ruin everything?

285
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:04,134
It's all about his
family and his traditions

286
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,134
And his notes on my pie.

287
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:08,401
Oh, honey, calm down.

288
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:11,301
You know, you always think
the... the worst of people.

289
00:13:11,334 --> 00:13:13,301
Cyrus made reservations for dinner

290
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,700
At your favorite restaurant,
the gramercy tavern.

291
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:19,734
So he's having the chef
make your favorite recipes...

292
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:22,900
Oyster stuffing that you like.

293
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,867
That's not the point,
mother. The point is

294
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,867
That thanksgiving is a family holiday,

295
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,867
And this is our family now.

296
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:33,966
Now you get with the program, and fast.

297
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:37,500
I hope there's some of
that pie left for me.

298
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:39,366
Is there?

299
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,933
Gimme. Mmm!

300
00:13:40,966 --> 00:13:42,933
Mmm! Isn't that wonderful?

301
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:44,433
Oh, yes.

302
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:47,500
Dorota, everything's awful.

303
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:51,033
I know thing you want
to know, miss blair,

304
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:52,916
But i not supposed to tell.

305
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,766
Who do you work for? Spill it.

306
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:57,933
Your mother make me keep
this safe until tomorrow.

307
00:13:57,966 --> 00:14:01,100
Keep what safe?

308
00:14:02,566 --> 00:14:06,066
Mr. Rose propose this evening at dinner.

309
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,899
They be telling
everyone at thanksgiving,

310
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:11,632
When whole family is there.

311
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:13,899
I saw your father today.

312
00:14:13,932 --> 00:14:15,899
Yeah, i had a feeling.

313
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:17,899
I know you both need some time,

314
00:14:17,932 --> 00:14:20,500
So i convinced him to let
you stay here for a while.

315
00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:23,532
And when you're ready, i would
love to help you talk to him

316
00:14:23,565 --> 00:14:25,199
And make things right.

317
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:27,699
Thanks for the offer. I
really... i appreciate it,

318
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:30,466
But, you don't know
how he's been, so...

319
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,632
Jenny, he's your father,

320
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:36,033
And he loves you so much.

321
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:40,066
And at least for the next couple years,

322
00:14:40,099 --> 00:14:42,333
You belong at home with him.

323
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:45,665
Thank you, mrs. Bass,

324
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:48,699
For letting me stay here and everything,

325
00:14:48,732 --> 00:14:50,500
But i'm pretty tired, so i'm...

326
00:14:50,532 --> 00:14:52,315
Okay, well, get some rest.

327
00:14:52,315 --> 00:14:54,099
We can talk some more tomorrow.

328
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,832
Oh, jenny...

329
00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:21,000
So you're okay with it, jenny
not being with us tonight?

330
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,933
If, by "okay, " you mean
extraordinarily depressed,

331
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,933
Then yes. I miss her a lot.

332
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,933
You know, in the all arguments
you two have been having,

333
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:30,933
I haven't once heard you tell her that.

334
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:32,933
Oh, my god. You're right.

335
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:35,232
It's not that rare, is it?

336
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:39,599
Aaron, what are you doing here?

337
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:41,633
I live right around the corner.

338
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,399
I'm just picking something
up to take to...

339
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:46,415
Oh, no. It's... it's all
right. I can hear her name.

340
00:15:46,415 --> 00:15:48,399
Serena's.

341
00:15:48,432 --> 00:15:50,699
You know what?

342
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:53,933
I'm just gonna go and see
if there are any pecans left.

343
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:56,533
So, you know,
could you do me a favor

344
00:15:56,566 --> 00:15:58,533
And say hi to serena's family for me?

345
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:01,200
'Cause we all spent last
thanksgiving together.

346
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:01,666
Yeah, ablutely.

347
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,466
Except bart, actually.

348
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:05,966
There was this, this
crazy thing with,

349
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,483
With my dad and her mom

350
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:08,966
And my mom, and it was, i guess,

351
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,217
Like all things in serena's
life, it's very complicated.

352
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:12,666
Serena's life is complicated?

353
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:14,666
Well, yeah. I don't know about you,

354
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:17,200
But the serena i know has
long, flowing blonde hair,

355
00:16:17,232 --> 00:16:20,200
Towers over both of us.
Is... is that the same one?

356
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:22,966
I just don't see her as complicated.

357
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:24,765
So would you say that they're

358
00:16:24,765 --> 00:16:26,532
Cheddar people or more goaty?

359
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:28,532
Oh, serena's something goat but cheese.

360
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:31,532
I think you might want
to go with the, uh,

361
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:32,696
Wines of southern... france.

362
00:16:32,696 --> 00:16:35,332
Well, i guess you don't know
her as well as you think you do.

363
00:16:35,365 --> 00:16:36,048
She doesn't drink anymore.

364
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:38,332
Oh, sure. I mean, not
problematically, of course.

365
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,032
I mean, at least not for months.

366
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,699
Wait. Months?

367
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:44,166
Yeah, well, y-You know,
the thing in the spring

368
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,033
With georgina? You two
are getting serious.

369
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:49,116
I'm sure you guys talked about that.

370
00:16:49,116 --> 00:16:51,166
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

371
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,365
I'm, i'm gonna go pay for this.

372
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,739
Mother. Is there anything
you want to tell me?

373
00:16:58,772 --> 00:17:01,006
Oh, yes, actually, there is,

374
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:03,705
And i will tell you
tonight at the restaurant

375
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,905
Once everyone is assembled for dinner.

376
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,072
Of all the things you've done, mother,

377
00:17:08,106 --> 00:17:10,972
This is one of the
worst. I'm your daughter.

378
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:13,339
Lumping me in with everyone
else to hear the news?

379
00:17:13,373 --> 00:17:15,772
I don't know what news you
are referring to, blair.

380
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:18,002
Now if you'll excuse
me, i have to go check

381
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:20,206
The reservations for dinner.

382
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,406
Dorota, get it together. We're leaving.

383
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,439
If i'm just like anyone else to her,

384
00:17:24,473 --> 00:17:26,439
Doubt she'll notice i'm not at dinner.

385
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:27,789
But it's your favorite holiday.

386
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:29,206
Not anymore.

387
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,106
Nate?

388
00:17:32,139 --> 00:17:34,306
Hey, vanessa.

389
00:17:34,339 --> 00:17:36,306
I didn't expect to see anyone here.

390
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:38,772
I had some paperwork to catch up on.

391
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:40,122
I thought, it's thanksgiving.

392
00:17:40,122 --> 00:17:41,439
It'd be quiet. Why are you here?

393
00:17:41,473 --> 00:17:43,439
Oh, i borrowed this
pixies box set from rufus.

394
00:17:43,473 --> 00:17:47,339
I was gonna return
it. I wrote a thank-You note.

395
00:17:47,373 --> 00:17:49,786
If you could give it to him,
that'd be... that'd be nice.

396
00:17:49,786 --> 00:17:51,439
Why didn't you take it by the loft?

397
00:17:51,473 --> 00:17:53,506
Well, i think dan likes me

398
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,039
About as much as you do right now, so...

399
00:17:58,106 --> 00:18:01,373
Look, you and
chuck and dan...

400
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:04,872
I've somehow managed
to alienate everyone.

401
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:09,406
If you could just give rufus the cds

402
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:12,239
And... and the thank-You note,
i'd really appreciate that.

403
00:18:12,273 --> 00:18:13,705
Of course.

404
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:16,239
And, vanessa, listen...

405
00:18:16,273 --> 00:18:18,239
Take care of yourself.

406
00:18:18,273 --> 00:18:19,339
All right?

407
00:18:24,273 --> 00:18:25,756
My new boyfriend aaron

408
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:27,239
Is on his way here to meet everyone,

409
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,981
And i want your word on something.

410
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:31,672
If you're talking about
the dress, i say "higher."

411
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:34,672
Chuck, i want you word that
you will not mention anything

412
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:36,772
About the girl i used to be.

413
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:38,772
I just got aaron to myself,

414
00:18:38,805 --> 00:18:41,705
And if the one thing i have
to do to keep it that way

415
00:18:41,739 --> 00:18:43,705
Is hide my recent history for a while,

416
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:45,222
Then that's what i'm gonna do.

417
00:18:45,222 --> 00:18:46,705
I get it. You lied to him.

418
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:48,906
N... no,
i didn't.

419
00:18:48,939 --> 00:18:52,039
I merely chose not to tell
him everything i ever did.

420
00:18:52,072 --> 00:18:54,305
And it will come out
naturally, over the course

421
00:18:54,305 --> 00:18:56,538
Of the many conversations
we're gonna have,

422
00:18:56,538 --> 00:18:58,772
As we're dating exclusively.

423
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:02,506
You have my word, whatever that's worth.

424
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,039
Where are you going?

425
00:19:04,072 --> 00:19:06,139
Eric's waiting for me
in my father's study.

426
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:08,106
We're having a business meeting.

427
00:19:09,672 --> 00:19:11,801
Oh, my god! You're here!

428
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:13,434
Hey.

429
00:19:13,467 --> 00:19:15,567
"Hey"... that was so not on
the same level as my hi.

430
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:17,567
I bumped into dan at the store.

431
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:20,601
He just said something.
I'm trying to figure it out.

432
00:19:20,634 --> 00:19:22,100
Figure what out?

433
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:24,267
Something about a girl named georgina?

434
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,567
What?

435
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:29,367
What... what's, he
even talking about?

436
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,601
That's,

437
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:33,634
Gosh...

438
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:37,501
Well, you know, he's...
he's probably just jealous.

439
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:40,133
Yeah. Yeah, i mean, he
was talking a lot about

440
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:42,567
Thanksgiving last year when
you two were together, so...

441
00:19:42,601 --> 00:19:45,567
Yeah. Well, i guess
he's just not as over me

442
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,434
As i thought he was.
But... but seriously,

443
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:52,434
Aaron, the next time he starts
to tell you stories about me...

444
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:55,300
No, no, no, no. Never again.
No, it's not gonna happen again.

445
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:57,501
Could you?

446
00:19:57,534 --> 00:19:59,100
Yeah.

447
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh, it, says "lily."

448
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:09,634
What's going on? Is something wrong?

449
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,634
I've been grappling
with what to do all day...

450
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:15,000
What to say, which one
of you to talk to first.

451
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:18,267
-Is jenny okay?
-Yes, but you might not be.

452
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,334
I know it is thanksgiving,

453
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:23,634
-But i think you should get here right away.
-Lily?

454
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:26,801
I will see you soon.

455
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:31,167
-Come on. We're going.
-Vanessa's coming over.

456
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,567
Call and cancel.

457
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:42,701
Vanessa abrams.

458
00:20:42,734 --> 00:20:45,834
Can i help you?

459
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:49,367
I'd like to talk to you
about nate archibald.

460
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,734
Are you going to open it?

461
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:54,234
I don't know.

462
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:56,234
I'll tell you the combination.

463
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:58,533
8-7-69... my
mother's birthday.

464
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:11,334
It's like the end of every
heist movie ever made.

465
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:14,700
Are those gold bars? I didn't
think they actually made those.

466
00:21:14,734 --> 00:21:16,867
Is that... is
that a sat phone?

467
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,267
Encryption. Government
prototype. Put it back.

468
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:28,101
I knew you'd come back for more.

469
00:21:28,134 --> 00:21:31,900
Chuck, you know how hard this call
was for me to make. I'm listening.

470
00:21:31,934 --> 00:21:35,023
The fbi just came to see
me, and nate's in trouble.

471
00:21:35,023 --> 00:21:36,567
Tell someone who cares.

472
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,834
Chuck, this is serious.
He needs our help.

473
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:41,401
Where are you?

474
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,067
The gallery.

475
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,867
Sorry, kid. I have to do something.

476
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,533
Yeah. Happy hunting.

477
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:54,767
Okay.

478
00:22:11,101 --> 00:22:12,815
Don't you dare answer
that blackberry, dorota.

479
00:22:12,815 --> 00:22:14,568
But it's your mother,
and it's thanksgiving.

480
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,767
And we have nothing to be thankful for.

481
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,767
This is the worst
thanksgiving of all time,

482
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,767
And if we have to wander
the upper east side

483
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,267
Like outcasts in a jane
austen novel, so be it.

484
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:25,267
Maybe we can go feed ducks at boat pond

485
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:27,633
Like when you were little.

486
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:29,234
Fine.

487
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:30,900
I'm not a monster.

488
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,900
I won't deny the ducks their dinner.

489
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:36,767
But if you look like you
enjoy even one second of it,

490
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,134
We're leaving.

491
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:41,134
- Oh, no. None for me, thank you.
- Mom.

492
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:44,134
- Serena, it's a special occasion. No,
- I'm only 17.

493
00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:47,501
Well, that's never stopped you.
No. No, i said no, thank you, okay?

494
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:50,501
Mom, have you shown aaron
your beautiful art collection?

495
00:22:50,534 --> 00:22:53,000
Oh, yeah. Was that
a jessica craig-Martin

496
00:22:53,034 --> 00:22:56,000
I saw over there? Why,
yes, it is, aaron. Good eye.

497
00:22:56,034 --> 00:22:58,334
I know. Yeah,
i'll... i'll be right back.

498
00:22:58,367 --> 00:23:01,334
I... my shoes are killing me.

499
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:03,334
This is crazy, jen.

500
00:23:03,367 --> 00:23:05,633
These are e-Mails of mine, photographs,

501
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:08,101
Notes from my psychiatrist
at the ostroff center.

502
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:11,167
So much for doctor/patient
confidentiality?

503
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:14,534
What about serena's and your mom's?

504
00:23:14,568 --> 00:23:16,534
I can't bear to open them.

505
00:23:16,568 --> 00:23:19,234
These are... five
times the size of mine.

506
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:22,867
I'm sorry.

507
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,600
Speaking about seeing things,

508
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:28,468
Have you seen my emancipation papers?

509
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:31,201
Because they're not in my bag,

510
00:23:31,234 --> 00:23:33,211
And i really don't want
anyone to find them.

511
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,867
Eric? Jenny? Are you two up there?

512
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,867
Come on downstairs. Be social.

513
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,101
Yeah. We're coming.

514
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:42,367
Has chuck finally decided to
grace us with his presence?

515
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:45,700
- Actually...
- What's he doing here?

516
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:48,600
I invited him.

517
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:53,201
Hi, mr. Bass. Daniel.

518
00:23:53,234 --> 00:23:55,534
Aaron, hey, man.

519
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:58,367
Well, if it isn't the last
person i wanted to see.

520
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:00,401
Wh... i'm... i'm
sorry?

521
00:24:00,434 --> 00:24:03,334
Why'd you lie about serena?

522
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:05,167
Oh, my god.

523
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:06,667
Where is she?

524
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,667
She should be right down.

525
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,167
Dad?

526
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:17,733
Dan.

527
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:19,401
And aaron. Hey.

528
00:24:19,434 --> 00:24:20,667
What's up?

529
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,667
Well, your boyfriend called me a liar.

530
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,234
Did... did... did i
lie about something?

531
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:28,267
You know, dan, maybe you
and i should talk in private,

532
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:30,267
To discuss who said what to whom

533
00:24:30,301 --> 00:24:32,667
And why they felt compelled to say it?

534
00:24:35,201 --> 00:24:37,600
Yeah, that's... we
don't need to do that.

535
00:24:37,633 --> 00:24:40,600
She's right. I lied. Yeah,
well, it's not cool, man.

536
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:43,234
If you have a problem
with me dating your ex,

537
00:24:43,267 --> 00:24:45,434
At least be honest about it.
You're right. I'll be honest.

538
00:24:45,468 --> 00:24:47,867
Yeah. Serena, i'm sorry,
but i'm already late

539
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,568
To meet my father at the waldorfs'. Bye.

540
00:24:54,401 --> 00:24:57,067
You didn't exactly tell him the truth.

541
00:24:57,101 --> 00:25:00,067
-Well, you didn't exactly have to.
-You know, i'm sorry.

542
00:25:00,101 --> 00:25:01,851
I thought... i thought
he knew. I really did.

543
00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:03,267
Well, he didn't, and he doesn't.

544
00:25:04,934 --> 00:25:06,568
I'm sorry.

545
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,134
I panicked,

546
00:25:08,167 --> 00:25:10,134
And i was mad at you.

547
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:13,468
No, i should have kept my mouth shut.

548
00:25:13,501 --> 00:25:16,468
But really, serena? I mean,

549
00:25:16,501 --> 00:25:18,468
You're g... you have to
tell him everything.

550
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:21,468
If there's one thing that
we earned this past year...

551
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:24,600
See, around here, the
truth always comes out.

552
00:25:24,633 --> 00:25:27,600
It just did.

553
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:36,000
You know, when you called, i
thought it was an emergency.

554
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:40,167
- Obviously i was wrong.
- It's more like an intervention.

555
00:25:40,201 --> 00:25:42,367
There's someone you need to talk to.

556
00:25:44,534 --> 00:25:46,600
The fbi knows that your dad's in town,

557
00:25:46,633 --> 00:25:48,700
And they think he's
about to commit a crime

558
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:50,700
Even worse than fraud or embezzlement.

559
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:52,101
Like what?

560
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,633
Like extortion and kidnapping.

561
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:58,733
When your father escaped to dominica,

562
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:01,234
He could only get his
hands on enough money

563
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:03,234
To get himself set up.

564
00:26:03,267 --> 00:26:05,234
He should have found a
job, reinvented himself.

565
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:07,633
But instead, he lid the
way he'd always lived.

566
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:09,150
Now he's got nothing left.

567
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,633
Yeah, well, if my father's poor,

568
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:13,568
What's the point of us
going to live with him?

569
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,067
I mean, we don't have any money.

570
00:26:15,067 --> 00:26:16,534
But the vanderbilts do.

571
00:26:16,568 --> 00:26:18,534
Yeah, look, why would
my grandparents pay us

572
00:26:18,568 --> 00:26:21,800
To go live with him when they
can't even help us out here?

573
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:23,384
I mean, they hate my dad.

574
00:26:23,384 --> 00:26:24,934
Maybe that's why they
would give him money...

575
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:28,434
To leave without you or your mom.

576
00:26:28,468 --> 00:26:31,301
We've been monitoring
your father's calls.

577
00:26:31,334 --> 00:26:33,437
He's trying to get in touch
with your grandparents.

578
00:26:33,437 --> 00:26:34,867
W-Well, i mean, if this is true,

579
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,800
Why didn't you just come
tell me this yourself?

580
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:39,317
We didn't know if you or your mother

581
00:26:39,317 --> 00:26:40,800
Knew what was going on.

582
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:43,425
After all, she helped him
escape in the first place.

583
00:26:43,425 --> 00:26:45,000
But i told him i didn't think

584
00:26:45,034 --> 00:26:46,597
That you would just leave new york.

585
00:26:46,597 --> 00:26:49,034
Especially without saying
good-Bye to your friends.

586
00:26:52,101 --> 00:26:55,101
I'll let the three of you talk it over.

587
00:26:56,967 --> 00:27:00,733
This is just too much.

588
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:03,767
There is still a chance that
the captain can get away,

589
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,834
If that's what you want.

590
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:10,000
But you could also end it all now.

591
00:27:10,034 --> 00:27:12,934
How?

592
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:15,401
By turning your father in.

593
00:27:17,267 --> 00:27:19,234
I'm sorry i didn't call you back, okay?

594
00:27:19,267 --> 00:27:21,733
A lot has been happening.
Agnes kicked me out.

595
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:23,234
She burned all my dresses,

596
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,234
And then i had to crash with eric.

597
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:27,234
I had nowhere else to go.

598
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:29,234
And i couldn't tell
anyone i was living here

599
00:27:29,267 --> 00:27:32,101
Because then they'd tell
you, and you'd be really mad.

600
00:27:32,134 --> 00:27:35,434
I'm not. I'm out of
angry. Miss you too much.

601
00:27:35,468 --> 00:27:38,568
Dad, please don't try to
guilt trip me right now, okay?

602
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,101
Your brother helped me realize

603
00:27:40,134 --> 00:27:42,234
That i haven't told you
something... something important.

604
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:46,301
-What?
-I love you, jenny. I love you so much,

605
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:48,301
I'm willing to let you go

606
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:51,067
If that's what it's gonna
take to get you back.

607
00:27:51,101 --> 00:27:53,401
And when the time comes
for a court hearing,

608
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:55,967
I won't stand in your way.

609
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,967
But there's nothing you can do

610
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,934
To make me stop loving you.

611
00:28:01,434 --> 00:28:04,401
I'm sorry.

612
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:21,933
Dan and his father just
left to look for jenny,

613
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:24,701
So maybe now would be
the perfect time for you

614
00:28:24,734 --> 00:28:27,022
To tell me what the hell's
been going on here today, lily.

615
00:28:27,022 --> 00:28:28,167
You first.

616
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,667
Where did you get those?

617
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,134
It doesn't matter. Did you read these?

618
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,634
-Not yet.
-Only mine.

619
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:35,667
None of you were supposed to

620
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:37,667
Find them? I can't believe this.

621
00:28:37,701 --> 00:28:39,176
You did this to me, and i dealt with it.

622
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,962
But the kids? My kids?

623
00:28:40,962 --> 00:28:42,748
-Mom, you knew about this?
- We'll talk about that later.

624
00:28:42,748 --> 00:28:44,534
I'm just trying to protect them.

625
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:47,334
If you're gonna let
your son and daughter

626
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:50,234
Go where they please
and do as they please,

627
00:28:50,267 --> 00:28:51,604
Someone has to look out for them.

628
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,734
There's a difference
between looking out for them

629
00:28:53,768 --> 00:28:55,900
And treating them like
criminals in their own home.

630
00:28:55,933 --> 00:29:00,434
How do you expect them to
trust us if we don't trust them?

631
00:29:00,467 --> 00:29:03,234
God. Okay, kids, let's go.

632
00:29:05,534 --> 00:29:07,200
Where are you going?

633
00:29:07,234 --> 00:29:09,200
Oh, well, this day is about family,

634
00:29:09,234 --> 00:29:11,200
And if you're not for this family,

635
00:29:11,234 --> 00:29:14,701
Then i'm gonna take mine
and spend it with them.

636
00:29:22,467 --> 00:29:24,534
Where have you been?

637
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:26,968
Your mother's almost done
packing. We have to go.

638
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:28,136
Do you really think
your plan's gonna work?

639
00:29:28,136 --> 00:29:29,271
Well, it will if we hurry up.

640
00:29:29,271 --> 00:29:29,901
Come on. Let's go.

641
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,567
No, i don't mean that.
Are you really planning

642
00:29:32,601 --> 00:29:35,934
On holding me and mom for ransom?

643
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,400
Not all the money's for me,
nate. It's for you guys, too.

644
00:29:40,434 --> 00:29:41,917
Look, this way, you and your mom

645
00:29:41,917 --> 00:29:43,400
Will get everything you deserve,

646
00:29:43,434 --> 00:29:46,634
And i will have enough to
start over wherever i go next.

647
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:48,801
Look, i want to take care of you,

648
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:50,349
But i don't know what else to do.

649
00:29:50,349 --> 00:29:52,801
No, there's a different way
to get our lives back, dad,

650
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:56,400
One that doesn't require another felony.

651
00:29:56,434 --> 00:30:00,001
-The fbi are on the way
here. -Nate, please...

652
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:01,834
Dad, listen. I love you,

653
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:04,734
But if you can't do the right thing,

654
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:06,767
Then i can't respect you.

655
00:30:06,801 --> 00:30:08,767
So the choice is yours.

656
00:30:08,801 --> 00:30:10,767
You go out that service entrance

657
00:30:10,801 --> 00:30:13,068
And you ruin our relationship forever...

658
00:30:14,634 --> 00:30:16,601
Or you be a man

659
00:30:16,634 --> 00:30:18,667
And you turn yourself
in when they get here.

660
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:21,767
- Well, that's not a choice.
- It is a choice,

661
00:30:21,801 --> 00:30:24,767
Because i'm sick of living in the mess

662
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:27,701
You've created for us, and
i'm not gonna do it anymore.

663
00:30:27,734 --> 00:30:29,634
I hope you won't either.

664
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:33,367
The annual van der woodsen
diner thanksgiving dinner.

665
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,834
Hmm. We should have a
standing reservation.

666
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,634
I think we do.

667
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,667
What errand did serena have to run?

668
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:42,500
I don't know, but she
took her file with her.

669
00:30:42,534 --> 00:30:44,034
Maybe she went to burn it.

670
00:30:44,034 --> 00:30:45,534
I don't blame her. I
should have burned mine.

671
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:49,068
I lied before.

672
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,034
I read it.

673
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:56,968
Eric, whatever
you read...

674
00:30:57,001 --> 00:30:58,968
I can't believe you didn't tell me

675
00:30:59,001 --> 00:31:02,034
You were in an institution like me.

676
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:05,334
You were 19. You were just
a few years older than i was,

677
00:31:05,367 --> 00:31:07,027
And after everything i
went through last year...

678
00:31:07,027 --> 00:31:08,334
Maybe i should have said something,

679
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,867
But i wanted to be strong for you.

680
00:31:10,901 --> 00:31:13,834
Plus, i really wasn't
ready to revisit it.

681
00:31:13,867 --> 00:31:17,601
I look forward to talking
about it... when you're ready.

682
00:31:17,634 --> 00:31:21,068
It takes time. I should know.

683
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:24,867
How did you get so wise?

684
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:26,100
The nanny.

685
00:31:31,267 --> 00:31:33,001
Okay.

686
00:31:33,034 --> 00:31:36,834
How about we have a
real thanksgiving dinner?

687
00:31:36,867 --> 00:31:38,434
It's not too late.

688
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:40,767
What'd you have in mind?

689
00:31:40,801 --> 00:31:42,534
Well, come on.

690
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,567
And... oh,
serena.

691
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:50,567
I was hoping that you were blair.

692
00:31:50,601 --> 00:31:53,100
Oh, why? Where is she?
Maybe you can find out.

693
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:54,950
She's ignoring all our calls.

694
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,767
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe she will take yours.

695
00:31:56,801 --> 00:31:57,634
Would you mind?

696
00:31:57,634 --> 00:31:58,467
Yeah, of course.

697
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:02,917
I'll let you know as soon
as i hear back from her.

698
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:04,567
Thank you.

699
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:06,567
-Is aaron here?
-He's over there.

700
00:32:09,068 --> 00:32:10,534
Serena, hey.

701
00:32:10,567 --> 00:32:12,901
Hey. Dan didn't lie. I did.

702
00:32:12,934 --> 00:32:15,801
It was more of a lie
of omission, but still.

703
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,901
I-I'm sorry i didn't
tell you everything.

704
00:32:17,934 --> 00:32:20,567
I should have. Read this.

705
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:24,534
If you still want to be with
me after, then let me know.

706
00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:34,667
- She's on 5th and 71st.
- Oh, thank you.

707
00:32:34,701 --> 00:32:37,467
- Happy thanksgiving.
- Happy thanksgiving, dear.

708
00:32:45,334 --> 00:32:48,667
What are you doing?

709
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:52,634
My dad and i got in a fight,

710
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:56,300
I was crashing at eric's,
and he finally chased me down.

711
00:32:56,334 --> 00:32:58,334
You're lucky.

712
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:01,667
You have a family who fights for you.

713
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:04,001
Mine doesn't even care if i'm there.

714
00:33:04,034 --> 00:33:07,133
Well, your mom loves you
in her own way, blair.

715
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:08,767
But the way your father loves you-

716
00:33:08,768 --> 00:33:10,668
I never had that.

717
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:13,767
My own dad, as sweet
as he is, isn't here.

718
00:33:13,801 --> 00:33:15,167
Your father...

719
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,367
Will go anywhere for you, anytime.

720
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,034
I know because i've sometimes

721
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:23,035
Even made it happen.

722
00:33:27,934 --> 00:33:29,300
What?

723
00:33:31,034 --> 00:33:33,400
What? Is it my hair?

724
00:33:33,434 --> 00:33:34,968
No. You're just wrong.

725
00:33:38,068 --> 00:33:39,968
Jenny.

726
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:42,034
You look cold.

727
00:33:42,068 --> 00:33:43,267
Here.

728
00:33:46,001 --> 00:33:47,534
Come home, dear.

729
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,934
You've made your point.

730
00:33:48,935 --> 00:33:50,535
I don't think i have.

731
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:52,867
Well, i think that you
might feel differently

732
00:33:52,901 --> 00:33:54,567
When you find out what i have been

733
00:33:54,568 --> 00:33:57,868
Waiting to show you.

734
00:34:02,867 --> 00:34:04,801
- I'll come...
- Yes.

735
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,834
On one
condition...

736
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:08,834
Jenny has to go home, too.

737
00:34:08,867 --> 00:34:11,100
Well, i think that's a terrific idea.

738
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:14,100
Everyone should be where they belong on

739
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:17,334
Thanksgiving with their families.

740
00:34:17,367 --> 00:34:20,267
Now... come on. Come
on. Come on. Come on.

741
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,567
We'll drop you.

742
00:34:24,367 --> 00:34:26,801
What's going on?

743
00:34:40,901 --> 00:34:42,934
I love you both.

744
00:34:42,968 --> 00:34:44,734
I'm proud of you.

745
00:34:46,767 --> 00:34:49,334
No, don't.

746
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:51,634
Let me.

747
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:53,767
Howard, no.

748
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:56,068
What's going on?

749
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,534
- Mam
- What are you doing, howard?

750
00:34:57,535 --> 00:34:58,535
I'll be... i'll
be okay.

751
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:01,234
You have the right to remain silent.

752
00:35:01,235 --> 00:35:02,635
Anything you say can and will be

753
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:04,801
Used against you in a court of law

754
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:08,400
You have the right to
have an attorney present

755
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:26,901
Hey. We were hoping you'd be here.

756
00:35:26,934 --> 00:35:29,667
My mom's inside, signing
papers in the dark.

757
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,734
We got our house back.

758
00:35:31,735 --> 00:35:33,235
Now all we need is some electricity.

759
00:35:33,268 --> 00:35:36,001
But look, i can't
thank you guys enough.

760
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,433
I'm gonna give you guys a moment.

761
00:35:42,934 --> 00:35:45,500
I...

762
00:35:45,534 --> 00:35:47,500
Didn't want you to go.

763
00:35:47,534 --> 00:35:49,667
And i don't like to admit it,

764
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,834
But i still...

765
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:54,267
Still?

766
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,500
It's not important.

767
00:35:57,534 --> 00:35:59,000
There's the whole thing with jenny,

768
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:01,634
And i don't want to
get in the way of that.

769
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:03,933
Vanessa, i haven't heard
from jenny in weeks,

770
00:36:03,967 --> 00:36:07,801
So... if you'd like, i mean,

771
00:36:07,802 --> 00:36:08,802
Can we get together sometime?

772
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:13,834
I guess that'd be okay.

773
00:36:14,567 --> 00:36:16,767
Cool.

774
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:19,168
- Call me.
- I will.

775
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,634
By the way, i'm glad you stayed, too.

776
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:31,068
Thanks, man.

777
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:33,001
No, let's, let's get drunk instead.

778
00:36:46,101 --> 00:36:47,934
Daddy.

779
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:49,767
Oh, sweetheart.

780
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,034
Oh, honey.

781
00:36:51,067 --> 00:36:53,467
I would have come sooner.

782
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,867
There was a t.G.V. Strike.

783
00:36:54,868 --> 00:36:56,468
Wait. This is the surprise?

784
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,467
I thought you were getting engaged.

785
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,168
Well...

786
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:04,634
We are.

787
00:37:04,867 --> 00:37:06,534
I wanted your father to meet cyrus

788
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:09,000
Before we told everyone.

789
00:37:10,033 --> 00:37:11,100
If he didn't approve of the man

790
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:14,767
Who might become your stepfather,

791
00:37:14,801 --> 00:37:17,067
I couldn't quite marry him, could i?

792
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:22,167
Well, now that the cat's out of the bag,

793
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,367
I think this calls for a celebration.

794
00:37:24,401 --> 00:37:26,767
Mm-Hmm. Dessert first, i always say.

795
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,101
Thank you, dorota.

796
00:37:32,134 --> 00:37:34,433
Are you hungry?

797
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:38,534
I guess i'm ready for a new tradition.

798
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:52,033
I was kind of hoping she'd be here.

799
00:37:52,034 --> 00:37:53,334
Yeah. I was, too.

800
00:37:55,867 --> 00:37:58,667
You are.

801
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,767
I love you, too, dad.

802
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:06,101
I don't... i don't want
to not be your daughter.

803
00:38:12,234 --> 00:38:15,101
Guys, i can't breathe.

804
00:38:15,134 --> 00:38:16,600
- Good.
- Good.

805
00:38:31,234 --> 00:38:33,001
I don't need to read that.

806
00:38:33,334 --> 00:38:35,934
No, i think you do.

807
00:38:38,834 --> 00:38:40,734
Anything you want to tell me

808
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,735
You can tell me yourself.

809
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:44,300
I want to know you,

810
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:46,834
No matter what you've
done or how long ago

811
00:38:54,734 --> 00:38:59,134
- Anyone home?
- What're you doing here?

812
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:01,134
I don't know. It's thanksgiving,

813
00:39:01,167 --> 00:39:02,701
And i couldn't think of anywhere

814
00:39:02,702 --> 00:39:04,002
That felt more like home.

815
00:39:04,034 --> 00:39:06,834
I'm glad to see that
you couldn't either.

816
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:09,234
E., call serena.

817
00:39:09,267 --> 00:39:11,100
- I left a message already.
- Oh, good.

818
00:39:11,134 --> 00:39:13,567
- What about bart?
- Not coming.

819
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,367
All right. Dinner's
way behind schedule, so

820
00:39:17,401 --> 00:39:19,600
- Who wants to start cooking?
- I do.

821
00:39:19,634 --> 00:39:21,101
- Hey, vanessa.
- Hey.

822
00:39:21,134 --> 00:39:24,201
Those flowers are
beautiful. Are they for me?

823
00:39:24,234 --> 00:39:27,201
- Yes.
- Thank you.

824
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:34,667
- Hi.
- I'm glad you're back.

825
00:39:34,734 --> 00:39:36,600
I thought you were still mad at me.

826
00:39:36,601 --> 00:39:37,701
I was.

827
00:39:37,734 --> 00:39:43,000
Look, i'm really,
really sorry about nate.

828
00:39:43,034 --> 00:39:45,200
I mean, if it's any consolation,

829
00:39:45,234 --> 00:39:47,034
I don't think he ever
really liked me anyway.

830
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:50,300
I haven't heard from him in weeks, so

831
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:52,867
Our friendship is more important than

832
00:39:52,868 --> 00:39:53,968
- Some guy, right?
- Yeah.

833
00:39:54,001 --> 00:39:58,967
So let's just eat some turkey and

834
00:39:59,001 --> 00:40:00,567
- Put it behind us.
- Okay.

835
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,767
I missed you.

836
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,967
I missed you too.

837
00:40:04,968 --> 00:40:05,968
I call dibs on mashed potatoes.

838
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,767
Hey. Jen, your mail's
been piling up here.

839
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,134
It's mostly catalogs, but still,

840
00:40:09,135 --> 00:40:09,967
- You gotta sift through it.
- Okay.

841
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:11,867
Before you get going on that,

842
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:13,167
You care to help me

843
00:40:13,268 --> 00:40:14,768
- Find the marshmallows?
- Absolutely.

844
00:40:14,801 --> 00:40:17,158
Dan, you think you can handle

845
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:19,159
- The cranberry sauce?
- Oh, god. Yes.

846
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,333
Remember how to work that?

847
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:24,833
As the end of another
holiday draws near,

848
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:26,900
I'd like to take a moment

849
00:40:26,933 --> 00:40:28,400
To list all the things i'm thankful for.

850
00:40:30,934 --> 00:40:33,067
I'm thankful that no matter

851
00:40:33,068 --> 00:40:34,368
How dark things might get,

852
00:40:34,401 --> 00:40:37,134
Old friendships can
still be rekindled...

853
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,467
I'm thankful for new relationships

854
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,900
That help us realize how far we've

855
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:46,601
Come from who we were...

856
00:40:47,134 --> 00:40:49,733
And how close we get

857
00:40:49,734 --> 00:40:52,334
When we can really be ourselves.

858
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:55,333
I'm thankful to know that no matter

859
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:57,834
What they say. You can go home again,

860
00:40:57,867 --> 00:41:00,667
Whether it's your home or not.

861
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,501
Andrew, bart bass.

862
00:41:06,534 --> 00:41:09,201
I know i told you not to look into

863
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:11,101
Why my wife was in that sanatorium,

864
00:41:11,134 --> 00:41:12,734
But i've changed my mind.

865
00:41:12,735 --> 00:41:14,035
I'd really like to know.

866
00:41:14,067 --> 00:41:16,034
I'd like to know everything.

867
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:24,300
Excuse me. I have
to go call my folks.

868
00:41:24,334 --> 00:41:26,168
But the thing i'm most thankful for?

869
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:29,134
How even on the most giving of days,

870
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:32,234
People can still do
something unforgivable.

871
00:41:49,433 --> 00:41:52,667
Signed, stealed and delivered,

872
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,433
I'm yours.

873
00:41:54,467 --> 00:41:58,034
X.O.X.O., gossip girl.
