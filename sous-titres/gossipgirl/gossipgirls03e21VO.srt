00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:07,715
I made the biggest mistake
of my life walking out on you.

4
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,925
I promise to make it up to you,
because I love you.

5
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:13,679
You told me you were selling me oxy,
but those pills were antibiotics.

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,060
Dad. I can explain.

7
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,433
Come with me.
We're going home, to Brooklyn.

If Dr. Van Der Woodsen
loves your mother,

10
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,397
I want to talk to you.

00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,430
<i>Obviously, I'm not a doctor,</i>

12
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,443
but there's a problem
with her medicine.

13
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,153
- Name's Cameron.
- Blair.

14
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,072
Do you want to make
that guy jealous?

15
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,947
- I'm game if you are.
- I'm game.

Humans who venture out in light
and aren't named "Bass".

29
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:15,950
- I have to tell you something.
- What's wrong?

30
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:18,244
I've never been on a date.

31
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,663
What about Chuck?
And Nate?

32
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:21,973
And Chuck.

33
00:01:22,098 --> 00:01:23,441
And then Nate again.

34
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,419
No, on a real date,
with someone I didn't know already

35
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,375
or who wasn't a british lord
masquerading as a college student.

36
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,550
B., obviously, Cameron liked you
when he met you at the loft party.

37
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:36,505
Be yourself and have fun.
And try the Marc Jacobs.

38
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,264
- I have to go.
- What's going on?

39
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,058
You haven't lusted
after a Louboutin all morning.

40
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:43,310
I just have to get home.

41
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,520
Is it Lily?

42
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,523
Rufus cheated on her.

43
00:01:48,071 --> 00:01:50,359
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.

44
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,945
I didn't know they even had
groupies that old.

45
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:55,489
They met at
the rooftop garden committee.

46
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:58,325
How is your mom taking it?

47
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,557
She doesn't know.

48
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:02,872
I told my dad, and he said it would be
best if we waited to tell her.

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,415
Stress isn't good for her.

50
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,142
Is there anything I can do?

51
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:09,128
Dorota's family has
polish mob connections.

52
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,172
No. Thank you, though.

53
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,241
I'm hoping

54
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,675
Rufus will stay away
until she gets stronger.

55
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:18,707
I don't know if handcuffs
are a good idea for a first date.

56
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,563
It's a good thing
you're not a drug dealer anymore.

57
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,428
That girl you sold
Lily's fake oxy to

58
00:02:30,553 --> 00:02:32,818
wanted double what she paid
to give me the bottle back.

59
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,103
- What'd you find?
- My pharmacist is looking into it.

60
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,000
Will he know
if they're bad for Lily?

61
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,149
He appreciates
a fine pharmaceutical.

62
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,634
Why are you whispering?

63
00:02:43,057 --> 00:02:45,206
If it's a seduction technique,
don't bother.

64
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,151
Ew. You wish.

65
00:02:47,276 --> 00:02:50,014
No, I'm grounded again.
Shocker, I know.

66
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:51,670
I'm not supposed to use the phone.

67
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,602
Fine.

68
00:02:52,727 --> 00:02:55,883
I'll let you know when
I hear something about the antibiotics.

69
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,250
<i>You give someone something?</i>

70
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,561
Only hours and hours of enjoyment.

71
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,166
Thank you for that visual.
I'm gonna go see Serena.

72
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,098
Does this mean she's finally out
from under her father's spell?

73
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:14,583
Serena's in a good place.

74
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:18,322
After Palm Beach, she stopped
running away or keeping secrets.

75
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,343
I'm glad.

76
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:22,910
Say hello to Blair for me.

77
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:25,599
I hope she has a great day.

78
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,707
Do not do anything
to mess with her date, please.

79
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,710
Her date?

80
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,294
With whom?

81
00:03:33,507 --> 00:03:34,380
You serious?

82
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,299
You have all your spies,
and you had to get it out of me?

83
00:03:37,824 --> 00:03:39,718
You finally stopped defiling
the pool table

84
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:41,720
with the entire cast
of Cirque du Soleil.

85
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,639
You got Blair into Columbia.

86
00:03:44,064 --> 00:03:47,117
- Why not let things end on a good note?
- I need to take this.

87
00:03:47,242 --> 00:03:50,229
And don't worry. I have more important
concerns than Blair's social life.

88
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:54,984
What can you tell me
about the pills?

89
00:03:56,928 --> 00:03:58,998
The only exception is schoolwork.

90
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:01,286
Chuck Bass is not giving you
your homework assignments.

91
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:03,951
What? Dad, you can't take it.
I didn't even do anything wrong.

92
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,808
I can spend
my last night with Vanessa

93
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:08,497
and come home to my family fighting
like they still live here.

94
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:10,249
Your sister's a drug dealer.

95
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,596
Was. Past tense.
And you already grounded me for it.

96
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,086
Grounded to the loft?

97
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,755
Lily said she needed some time,
so it was easier to bring Jenny here.

98
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,799
And Jenny
would much rather be here anyway.

99
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,547
And Jenny's dad thinks it's time
for her to do her homework.

100
00:04:21,672 --> 00:04:23,596
Talking about yourselves
like that is helping?

101
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,139
I can't work without my books.

102
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,475
I'll go to Lily's
and bring them back.

103
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,797
- Come with me?
- Sure.

104
00:04:29,922 --> 00:04:32,062
Yeah, Dan loves being
in the middle of these things.

105
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:42,531
Special delivery.

106
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,284
I'm getting awfully spoiled
having a doctor in the house.

107
00:04:45,523 --> 00:04:49,330
Although I am looking forward
to drinking my apple juice straight.

108
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,082
I'm surprised you can stand its smell
after being pregnant

109
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,130
with Serena.

110
00:04:53,255 --> 00:04:56,673
You're right. I did drink an awful lot
of it during those months, didn't I?

111
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,440
And not just apple juice,
that green apple juice

112
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,050
that place down in the Village.

113
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,094
I used to make you go all the way
downtown to get it for me.

114
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:08,390
You didn't make me. I'd go down there
now if the juice craze wasn't over.

115
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,477
About that speech...

116
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:13,479
Don't even say it.

117
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:14,628
I'm sorry.

118
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,271
I just got caught up in the moment,

119
00:05:17,396 --> 00:05:20,069
and it came out all wrong.

120
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,695
I was hoping that.

121
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,443
And I'm just so thrilled

122
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,325
to get to know the kids.
You've just done such

123
00:05:27,354 --> 00:05:28,869
an amazing job, Lily.

124
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,288
Really. You know, you and rufus.

125
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,347
Thank you.

126
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,504
I honestly don't know how we'd be
getting through all of this without you.

127
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:41,590
Which reminds me,

128
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:45,177
those homeopathic remedies are
clogging up my humidifier.

129
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:47,040
- Want to check it out?
- Yeah.

130
00:05:53,045 --> 00:05:55,270
- Hello?
- You didn't answer your cell.

131
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,272
You mean my dad didn't.
He took it.

132
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,989
Lily's pills are ivermectin.

133
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:01,527
They're great at battling parasites

134
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,570
and african river blindness,

135
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,365
but lymphoma, not so much.
Is it dangerous?

136
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,866
Does she know?

137
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,269
What we need to find out is
who prescribed them and when.

138
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,835
I wish I didn't rip
the label off the bottle.

139
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,957
The date and the drug store
were still legible,

140
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,418
which was enough to track down
the prescribing doctor.

141
00:06:18,017 --> 00:06:20,942
Luckily, pharmacists don't make
enough to turn down bribes.

142
00:06:22,037 --> 00:06:23,465
Okay, so what's next?

143
00:06:23,872 --> 00:06:26,934
The mission requires an expert,

144
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:29,821
someone highly trained

145
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:32,766
in the art of extorting information.

146
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,644
You're not seriously gonna use this
to try to get back with Blair.

147
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,001
My priority is the truth.

148
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,315
If she can expose it...

149
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,174
Then you'll take advantage of that
to make sure she doesn't move on.

150
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:44,570
I get it.

151
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,369
Let's just hope she's willing
to make herself available.

152
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:49,908
- Meet me at the Waldorfs'.
- <i>But wait. I'm...</i>

153
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:51,752
grounded.

154
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,217
Hey, Lil?

155
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,261
Rufus, I didn't know
you were coming over.

156
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,972
- We're picking up Jenny's schoolbooks.
- They're in her old room.

157
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,187
I thought my mom told you
she needed some time.

158
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:20,675
I just want to make sure we're still on
for that friends of the library thing.

159
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,068
I'm sorry, but if she wanted to talk
to you, then she would call you back.

160
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:27,029
You should leave.

161
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,364
Serena, does she have a problem
seeing me or is it you?

162
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:34,328
- Holland told me what happened.
- About the sublet? I told you already.

163
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,206
- I didn't want your dad living here.
- You know it's not about that.

164
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,018
- What's going on?
- I honestly don't know.

165
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,124
What did Holland tell you?

166
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:48,300
Why don't you just leave?

167
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:50,844
Why don't we call Holland...

168
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,472
and have her tell us herself?

169
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,647
I don't know
what you want me to say.

170
00:08:02,547 --> 00:08:04,108
Serena's under the impression

171
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:07,111
that you know something
about something I did.

172
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,199
I shouldn't be here.

173
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,910
I have nothing to hide from my family.
Just tell them the truth.

174
00:08:20,186 --> 00:08:22,417
Rufus and I slept together.

175
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,169
<i>Talk about love thy neighbor.</i>

176
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,338
- What?
- I'm sorry.

177
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,274
<i>Next time, Rufus,</i>

178
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,664
<i>choose one who knows
how to keep a secret.</i>

179
00:08:34,577 --> 00:08:35,806
This is absurd.

180
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,416
Sorry.
I didn't want you to find out like this.

181
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,104
Serena, this is not your fault.

182
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,845
Go upstairs, let me handle this.

183
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,667
Thank you
I'm gonna take you up on that.

184
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,461
I'm sorry. I never
meant to hurt anyone.

185
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,814
But it's probably best now
that the truth is out.

186
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:56,827
Except that this isn't the truth.

187
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,453
We don't need to hear this.

188
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,077
You can't expect me to lie.

189
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,047
You did.

190
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,001
You asked me to come up here.
You had to know it was going to happen.

191
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,503
Excuse me. Holland, right?

192
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:09,270
This kind of stress
is not good for lily.

193
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:11,186
Please tell her I'm sorry, again.

194
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:13,616
There's nothing to be sorry about.
Nothing happened.

195
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:15,137
I think you should leave too.

196
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:16,517
You'd love that?

197
00:09:16,642 --> 00:09:19,342
The only place I'm going is
to see my wife.

198
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:24,683
What'd I miss?

199
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:33,057
Lil, I'm sorry. I had no idea
she was an insane person.

200
00:09:33,182 --> 00:09:35,657
Look, I don't want
to discuss this with you.

201
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:38,026
Wait.
You actually believe her?

202
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,902
What does she have to gain,
standing here,

203
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:43,248
humiliating herself
in front of our family?

204
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,250
I don't know what's going on,
she's lying.

205
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:49,406
It'd be a lot easier to believe if you
hadn't left your scarf in her apartment.

206
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:52,485
We went over this. I told you,
nothing happened that night.

207
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,677
Rufus, you of all people could
understand why I might have a doubt.

208
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,348
You didn't talk to me for weeks after
you found that letter from william.

209
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,976
Lily, maybe you would do that,
but I wouldn't, and I didn't.

210
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,144
When you're ready to hear that
and talk about it,

211
00:10:06,543 --> 00:10:07,739
give me a call.

212
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:17,783
So crazy day
at the Van Der Woodsen's?

213
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,535
I just wanted to keep Rufus away
until my mom got stronger.

214
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:24,331
- You don't really think he did this?
- Why would holland lie about it?

215
00:10:24,783 --> 00:10:27,960
I don't know. I don't even know
who she is. But I do know Rufus.

216
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,963
He took me in when my dad
left us with nothing. He's a good guy.

217
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,643
They all are,
until they aren't anymore.

218
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:35,592
I'm just trying to protect my mom.

219
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:38,915
I get it, okay?
But just give him a chance.

220
00:10:39,427 --> 00:10:41,473
He gave you one
when you bailed on brown.

221
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,101
Are you really taking his side?

222
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,103
I'm not.
We're just talking about it.

223
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,230
Well, maybe that's not
such a good idea.

224
00:10:49,352 --> 00:10:51,402
I have to go be with my family.

225
00:11:01,383 --> 00:11:04,650
I don't see why we need Blair for this.
Don't you read "Gossip Girl"?

226
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:06,507
Extortion's what I do all day.

227
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:09,382
This is more than
headbands and high school.

228
00:11:10,651 --> 00:11:12,174
The two of you here together?

229
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:15,241
Please tell me there's an explanation
that doesn't involve the apocalypse.

230
00:11:15,366 --> 00:11:17,666
We come in peace and with a purpose.

231
00:11:18,402 --> 00:11:21,152
Something's going on
with Lily's medication.

232
00:11:21,718 --> 00:11:23,724
We need your mind game mastery
to find out what.

233
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,350
Who are you, House?

234
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:27,781
I'm sure dr. Van Der Woodsen
knows what he's doing.

235
00:11:27,906 --> 00:11:30,022
It's not Van Der Woodsen.
It's a psychiatrist.

236
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,773
- I have an address.
- It's weird?

237
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,143
Lily so does not seem
like she's in therapy.

238
00:11:34,268 --> 00:11:36,069
And you so should be.

239
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,892
But as much as I admire the attempt to
lure me back with subversive sleuthing,

240
00:11:40,017 --> 00:11:43,118
and appreciative as I am
of your help with columbia,

241
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,586
The answer's no.

242
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:49,616
I need to find out why someone
doesn't want Lily getting better.

243
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,709
A heartfelt plea as well.

244
00:11:52,063 --> 00:11:53,879
And much more effective
than a fatwa.

245
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,298
But you obviously already know
that I have a date today.

246
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,717
And nothing you can dangle
will make me miss it.

247
00:11:59,565 --> 00:12:01,515
Next time, don't bring Jenny.

248
00:12:05,268 --> 00:12:07,663
<i>I'm sorry you had to find out
about Rufus like that.</i>

249
00:12:07,788 --> 00:12:09,282
I know you two have become close.

250
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:11,491
I'm only concerned
with how you're doing.

251
00:12:11,616 --> 00:12:13,973
I'm not sure.
Is that too honest?

252
00:12:14,098 --> 00:12:15,920
No. No, it makes sense.

253
00:12:17,506 --> 00:12:20,894
After five marriages,
the last thing I want to do

254
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:23,045
is put you and serena
through another divorce.

255
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,920
It might sound cold,
but they do get easier.

256
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:30,735
Rufus is different, you know?
He's been like a father to you.

257
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,448
And I love him.

258
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,754
But if you think he cheated on you,
you can't stay with him because of me.

259
00:12:36,137 --> 00:12:37,925
You have to stay
because you still love him,

260
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,459
because you think you guys
can work through this.

261
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:43,345
It doesn't matter who you end up with
as long as you're still here.

262
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:51,907
Thanks for coming with me.
It means a lot, you getting involved.

263
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:54,482
My dad would have
done this and worse.

264
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:56,948
And no matter what
Serena wants to believe,

265
00:12:57,073 --> 00:12:59,111
there's no way Rufus
would hurt Lily like that.

266
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,714
Serena know you're doing this?

267
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,739
We'd see what we find out
before I tell her.

268
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,199
You're on dangerous ground.

269
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,911
But the only way to clean up this mess,
for everyone, is to find out the truth.

270
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,079
I know. That's why
we need the help of an expert.

271
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:13,041
Philosophy of war?

272
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,668
I'm finally home.

273
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:22,193
Please don't tell me my mother
rehired you as a cater waiter.

274
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:23,447
- I'm dan.
- Cameron.

275
00:13:23,572 --> 00:13:25,933
- Hey, Nate. Great game last week.
- Thanks. Sorry to interrupt.

276
00:13:26,058 --> 00:13:27,472
We need Blair's help.

277
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,015
Yes, people often drop by
with their problems

278
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,185
because they know
how supportive I am.

279
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,854
Supportive, i. e. scheming.

280
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:36,332
Did... Chuck send you?

281
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,609
His pill plan didn't work, so he sent
Frick and Frack to ruin my date?

282
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,719
No, Blair,
this is about my dad and Lily.

283
00:13:41,844 --> 00:13:44,322
This woman Holland has
accused him of cheating.

284
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,492
Wait a minute.

285
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,012
An artist
or a hippie activist maybe,

286
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,843
but rooftop garden committee?

287
00:13:51,968 --> 00:13:54,708
I knew that something wasn't right
when Serena told me.

288
00:13:55,397 --> 00:13:58,593
No way would another
Upper East Sider shtup Rufus.

289
00:13:58,718 --> 00:14:00,380
My stepfather's jewish.

290
00:14:01,518 --> 00:14:05,385
Blair, we can't let Lily leave rufus.
Will you help us?

291
00:14:07,506 --> 00:14:09,598
Exposing scandal
on the Upper East Side?

292
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:12,058
Show me your world.

293
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,689
They'd be lost without me.

294
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,567
Tell me everything you know
about this Holland person.

295
00:14:27,235 --> 00:14:29,206
Trust me. I live
with the Van Der Woodsens.

296
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:30,881
I learned how to lie.

297
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:39,461
- Can I help you?
- We're here to see dr. Kemble.

298
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,121
Did you have an appointment?

299
00:14:42,246 --> 00:14:44,508
I work for a troubled teen hotline,

300
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,427
and I'm worried that I said some
wrong things about drugs and depression,

301
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,140
and was hoping that dr. Kemble could
give me some advice.

302
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,265
Of course.
The doctor will be back next week.

303
00:14:52,635 --> 00:14:55,685
- Next week...
- Will be fine. Thank you.

304
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,482
And what brings you
and your mid-level entourage?

305
00:15:01,607 --> 00:15:02,651
Nothing personal.

306
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,320
We're looking for Holland,
who claims she slept with Rufus.

307
00:15:05,794 --> 00:15:07,155
Let me guess-

308
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,032
Dr. Holland kemble?

309
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:14,882
<i>You better hope this doctor gets healed,
before someone else gets hurt.</i>

310
00:15:30,371 --> 00:15:32,347
So what exactly am I looking for?

311
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,516
A bottle of pills,
like the one with the oxy.

312
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,481
<i>Hopefully, with the label on
this time.</i>

313
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:38,770
Or something else that can
directly link them to Holland.

314
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,369
Okay, I will rummage and report.

315
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:47,180
Holland is trying to poison Lily
so she can have Rufus all to herself.

316
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:48,947
So shakespearean.

317
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,824
Yeah. It's also "fatal attraction."

318
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:53,263
I just can't handle dead bunnies.

319
00:15:53,388 --> 00:15:55,942
Maybe I'm stating the obvious here,
but shouldn't we just tell Lily?

320
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:57,267
Tell her what?

321
00:15:57,392 --> 00:15:59,958
"Jenny tried to sell your
mislabeled meds, which somehow

322
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,921
Came from the woman who said
she slept with your husband"?

323
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,610
No, we have to get to holland first.

324
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:07,207
She's the one who can connect
all the dots, and then we go to Lily.

325
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:09,418
Holland will
be at the library benefit tonight.

326
00:16:09,543 --> 00:16:11,284
- I saw it on the calendar.
- Perfect.

327
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:14,472
Public humiliation always helps
when trying to elicit a confession.

328
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,560
We don't expect you to keep up.
It's beyond basic rugby strategy.

329
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:21,229
So hopefully, Jenny will find
something we can use as leverage.

330
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,640
Exactly, Humphrey.

331
00:16:22,765 --> 00:16:24,899
Glad to have you aboard this time.

332
00:16:25,323 --> 00:16:27,319
All right.
Rendezvous at my place.

333
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,487
Dress is black-tie.
I'll have tickets.

334
00:16:31,904 --> 00:16:32,657
So...

335
00:16:33,197 --> 00:16:35,132
You guys do
this kind of thing a lot?

336
00:16:35,257 --> 00:16:37,120
Oh, yeah.
A lot more than you'd think.

337
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:40,012
Last year, Georgina pretended
to be this rich canadian to get poppy,

338
00:16:40,137 --> 00:16:42,626
but things got all messed up
when she turned her back on Jesus.

339
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,071
But Dan doesn't
normally participate.

340
00:16:49,126 --> 00:16:53,130
So that's your "Sorry your husband
was cheating on you" present, a juicer?

341
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:55,877
Trust me.
It'll make your mother smile.

342
00:16:56,151 --> 00:16:59,934
Sometimes I wish she would have let you
take us away when you wanted to.

343
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,779
Tibet sounds pretty good right now.

344
00:17:01,904 --> 00:17:03,904
Only if you don't get typhoid.

345
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:07,073
Besides, wherever you run,
things still happen.

346
00:17:07,421 --> 00:17:09,634
All you can do is
try to learn from them.

347
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:12,637
Well, as awful as it's been,

348
00:17:13,272 --> 00:17:16,785
Maybe mom needed this to see
that she wasn't with the right man.

349
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:21,456
I'm not gonna take advantage of the
situation to get closer to your mother.

350
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,334
Well, you have been there
throughout her entire sickness.

351
00:17:25,203 --> 00:17:27,217
And this whole thing with rufus
could have happened

352
00:17:27,342 --> 00:17:30,792
so that you could finally stop
hiding how you really feel.

353
00:17:31,924 --> 00:17:34,065
I feel happy to be
out shopping with my daughter,

354
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,459
and to be able to spend some time

355
00:17:36,584 --> 00:17:39,140
- with the people that I love.
- Including mom.

356
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,452
Good-bye.

357
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,442
Do something tonight
to cheer her up.

358
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,320
There's the library benefit.
You could invite her.

359
00:17:52,756 --> 00:17:54,075
Only if you come, too.

360
00:18:22,254 --> 00:18:25,186
What are you doing here?
No pills to steal in Brooklyn?

361
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,897
I actually came by to get a dress...

362
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,426
If you haven't destroyed them all
already.

363
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,608
I have no interest
in your wannabe watanabe.

364
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,725
As I'm sure you saw,
your stuff is by the front.

365
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,951
And last time I checked, dresses weren't
in the kitchen near my mom's medicine.

366
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,078
Do you even
know what your dad's prescribing her?

367
00:18:44,196 --> 00:18:47,183
Probably something with high street
value or you wouldn't be interested.

368
00:18:47,308 --> 00:18:49,433
If you could just stop hating me
for, like, one second,

369
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:51,421
you'd see
I was trying to help your family.

370
00:18:52,085 --> 00:18:55,717
You and your dad have done wonderful
things for us Van Der Woodsens.

371
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,429
Like it's been such a banner year
for the Humphreys?

372
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,807
I would give it all back,
the clothes, the parties, the limo rides

373
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,977
- just for one day that felt normal.
- Then why are you still here?

374
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,286
You're right.

375
00:19:10,506 --> 00:19:13,244
Nothing would make me happier
than to go back to Brooklyn forever.

376
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:38,230
Was that Henny leaving?
Were you two fighting over Rufus?

377
00:19:38,355 --> 00:19:40,951
- I don't want you in the middle.
- That was just Jenny.

378
00:19:41,076 --> 00:19:43,097
You know her,
all angst, all the time.

379
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,905
- You okay? Do you want me to call dad?
- No, I'm fine.

380
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,300
I'm fine physically.

381
00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:52,379
Sitting around here is only
gonna make you worse.

382
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,026
Dad invited us
to the library benefit tonight.

383
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:58,652
- Why don't we go with him?
- Oh, my god. A juicer?

384
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,081
Don't tell me...

385
00:20:02,021 --> 00:20:05,328
A night out with your father is
exactly what the doctor ordered.

386
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:14,379
I'm sorry your new beau
had to abandon our mission.

387
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:16,383
He had a dinner with his rugby team.

388
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:17,488
How homoerotic.

389
00:20:17,613 --> 00:20:19,377
You know how I love that.

390
00:20:19,502 --> 00:20:21,555
We have plans to continue
our date later.

391
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,139
So are you all ready
to make the fat lady sing?

392
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,517
I'll settle for making
the lying doctor lady confess.

393
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,230
Here's Nancy Drew now.
Did you get our proof?

394
00:20:32,785 --> 00:20:35,567
Come on, jenny. The future of our family
is riding on your sleuthing.

395
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,658
I'm sorry. I looked everywhere,
but there was nothing.

396
00:20:47,232 --> 00:20:50,069
What now? If we don't have evidence,
she has no reason to tell us anything.

397
00:20:50,194 --> 00:20:53,539
Luckily, like every great general,
I have contingency plans.

398
00:20:53,664 --> 00:20:56,045
Archibald, it's time to make use
of those family connections.

399
00:21:01,672 --> 00:21:03,117
<i>Watch out, lonely boy.</i>

400
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:06,347
<i>Seems your little sister
has her own ideas</i>

401
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,415
<i>about your family's planning.</i>

402
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,403
Serena is here.
This complicates things.

403
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,405
We have to avoid them seeing us.

404
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,949
S. won't be on board,
And we can't have a blonde bombshell

405
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,575
blowing up our plan.

406
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,146
And the plan is
we wait some A.M.A. guy

407
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:44,897
who's friends with Nate's family?

408
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,388
The plan is you wait
with his ticket.

409
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,246
His name is Dr. Tabb,

410
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:51,684
so pretend
you're well-bred and be polite.

411
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,613
It'll pay off if you ever need
orthopedic surgery at Mount Sinai.

412
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,774
- Like when you stab me in the back.
- We will keep our eye on Holland.

413
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,918
Once our leverage arrives,
she'll either tell us the truth

414
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:04,364
or we tell Dr. Tabb,
and he revokes her license.

415
00:22:05,347 --> 00:22:07,492
I need a phone, too.
My dad took mine.

416
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,996
Don't worry, little. J. You'll be back
on Park Avenue in no time.

417
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:19,504
What are you doing?

418
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:20,672
Playing the part.

419
00:22:35,372 --> 00:22:38,140
Hi. Mount Sinai orthopedic?

420
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,082
Please let Dr. Tabb know
that there's no need to wait.

421
00:22:43,207 --> 00:22:46,207
Nate Archibald had a change of plans
And won't be coming in tonight.

422
00:22:47,925 --> 00:22:48,783
Thanks.

423
00:23:06,923 --> 00:23:08,880
I have to say,
it's really nice to be here

424
00:23:09,005 --> 00:23:11,757
with someone who doesn't
hate these sort of things.

425
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,750
- I have an idea.
- I've already had it.

426
00:23:29,822 --> 00:23:32,326
Dr. Kemble, I've been dying
to get ahold of you.

427
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,364
I've wanted to get him
to come to therapy for weeks.

428
00:23:38,956 --> 00:23:40,168
What are you doing here?

429
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,397
Serena called me,
but I was already on my way.

430
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:45,214
I figured if my grounded daughter
goes missing, I just have to wait

431
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,175
till the next party
to know where she is.

432
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:50,205
You have no reason to believe me,
but this time I'm trying to help you.

433
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,431
Jenny, is Holland here?
Oh, dad.

434
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,184
- What'd you say about Holland?
- The guy wasn't at the hospital,

435
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:59,729
- and Blair's not picking up.
- If she's here, I need to talk to her.

436
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,939
- Not a good idea.
- And you don't have a ticket.

437
00:24:04,388 --> 00:24:06,193
Dad, you're not even dressed.

438
00:24:18,684 --> 00:24:22,119
I know a scheme when I see one. I assume
Chuck and Blair are here somewhere?

439
00:24:22,244 --> 00:24:23,586
They're looking for Holland.

440
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:27,173
What was I supposed to do?
I know Rufus did not do this.

441
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:31,052
- And you won't even give him a chance.
- He wouldn't give my dad a chance.

442
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,889
Oh, so that's it? Anyone
who might not like your dad has to go?

443
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,274
Nate, all I asked you to do
was support me,

444
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:39,216
and instead,
you went behind my back.

445
00:24:40,025 --> 00:24:41,264
It's not like that.

446
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,523
I get why everyone else did this.

447
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,900
Dan and Jenny don't want
to believe that Rufus cheated,

448
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,115
Chuck will do anything
to get close to Blair,

449
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,656
and Blair, as much as she wants to,
can't run away from a game.

450
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,766
But you were supposed
to be on my side.

451
00:24:55,925 --> 00:24:58,788
As if watching Audrey Hepburn movies
isn't manhood-shriveling enough,

452
00:24:58,989 --> 00:25:01,028
- I have to talk about my feelings?
- Those movies

453
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,645
are the only romance I have in my life.
He loves his work more than he loves me.

454
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,143
I'm sorry. I really prefer
to see couples in my office.

455
00:25:07,268 --> 00:25:10,758
- Call and make an appointment.
- Please. Please.

456
00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:15,054
He traded me to his uncle...
For his hotel.

457
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,722
- Traded you?
- For sex.

458
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,762
Is it worse than you tricking me
into kissing a guy to give a speech?

459
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,854
That's not the same.
He's kissed guys before.

460
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,273
She slept with jack...
My uncle.

461
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,608
Clearly, you both
have hurt each other,

462
00:25:27,766 --> 00:25:29,708
And now neither of you feel safe.

463
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,279
How can we rebuild?

464
00:25:35,054 --> 00:25:38,327
It's going to take a lot of hard work
and a lot of time.

465
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,956
- Are there any trust games involved?
- I'm sorry. I really do have to go.

466
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,548
Did I hear talk of games?

467
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,721
Please, just make an appointment.

468
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:49,338
Just one more thing
that man over there

469
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,340
is on the A.M.A.
disciplinary committee.

470
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,969
Last time I checked, it was illegal
to prescribe mislabeled medication,

471
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,015
especially to those
who aren't your patients.

472
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,257
What?

473
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,743
You two really are sick.

474
00:26:01,425 --> 00:26:03,728
The person standing with him
is waiting for my signal,

475
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,655
to show him
I have proof of what you did

476
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:06,909
to Lily Humphrey.

477
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:09,650
Tell us why.
Are you in love with Rufus?

478
00:26:10,446 --> 00:26:11,616
They say psychiatrists

479
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,237
are the craziest ones.

480
00:26:13,801 --> 00:26:15,550
What the hell is going on?

481
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:20,786
Would you like to tell him or would
you like Dr. Disciplinary to do it?

482
00:26:24,445 --> 00:26:25,901
I only wrote those prescriptions

483
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,919
because I owed someone a favor.

484
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,990
The same
who told you say you slept with me?

485
00:26:30,115 --> 00:26:32,840
You really need to talk to William.

486
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,204
Where's Will?

487
00:26:39,404 --> 00:26:41,192
What's so important, Jenny?

488
00:26:41,848 --> 00:26:44,213
Holland's about to tell them
everything, if she hasn't already.

489
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,395
- Tell who what?
- Everyone.

490
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,565
The truth about you and Holland working
together to split up my dad and lily.

491
00:26:53,001 --> 00:26:55,655
Jenny, I'm sorry. I know
that you love your father very much...

492
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:59,108
Which is why I understand why you did
it. And I don't blame you for it either.

493
00:27:00,095 --> 00:27:02,662
If you're gonna get out of here,
you gotta go right now.

494
00:27:05,613 --> 00:27:07,041
Why are you telling me this?

495
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,872
So you can get your family back,

496
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:12,998
and I can get mine.

497
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,765
Thanks for your help. I'll call if
I hear about any cater waiter positions.

498
00:27:40,473 --> 00:27:41,610
Have you seen Lily?

499
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,036
She just left with Serena and Will.

500
00:27:44,806 --> 00:27:45,913
<i>In this family feud,</i>

501
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,581
<i>that's Van Der Woodsen, 1,</i>

502
00:27:48,555 --> 00:27:50,001
<i>Humphrey, 0.</i>

503
00:27:55,046 --> 00:27:56,427
You guys are home early.

504
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,717
Was that boring?

505
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:01,366
Action-packed, actually. Your father
gotta get back to Palm Beach.

506
00:28:01,491 --> 00:28:03,270
One of my patients
has taken a bad turn.

507
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:05,802
- I've gotta get down there right away.
- We're going with him.

508
00:28:05,927 --> 00:28:08,977
You guys get packed. I'll arrange
for a helicopter to go to Teterboro.

509
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:13,607
Eric, mom needs us right now.

510
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,110
This is our chance
to finally be a family.

511
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:20,711
I'll go get my stuff.

512
00:28:38,402 --> 00:28:41,577
Nate already tried calling.
There's no reason to defend your dad.

513
00:28:41,702 --> 00:28:43,112
We're already packing.

514
00:28:43,237 --> 00:28:45,414
I just want my mom
to be able to put this behind her.

515
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,879
I'm not calling about my dad.
I'm calling about yours.

516
00:28:48,004 --> 00:28:49,078
Don't hang up.

517
00:28:49,203 --> 00:28:51,187
I know how happy you are
to have him back,

518
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:54,523
<i>But he's the one who got Holland
to lie about the affair,</i>

519
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,650
and he had her prescribe
pills for Lily, too.

520
00:28:56,818 --> 00:29:00,029
Dan, my dad is a doctor. Why would
he need Holland to give her pills?

521
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:02,112
Because the pills
aren't helping her illness,

522
00:29:02,237 --> 00:29:04,064
and he didn't want them
traced back to him.

523
00:29:04,189 --> 00:29:06,619
Okay, what you're
saying is just crazy.

524
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,705
Any crazier than your whole family
leaving town with him tonight?

525
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,999
- I'm gonna go. Good-bye.
- Serena, wait!

526
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,135
You all set?
My bags are downstairs.

527
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:24,721
Yeah.

528
00:29:25,551 --> 00:29:28,132
You know, I was thinking
maybe we could just wait

529
00:29:28,257 --> 00:29:29,433
and, fly out tomorrow.

530
00:29:29,825 --> 00:29:32,645
I wish we could. I've got to
get to my patient immediately.

531
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,814
Are you sure that's what it's about?

532
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:38,275
People are saying you're
behind this Holland thing.

533
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,443
Holland?

534
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:44,749
Let me go check on mom.

535
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:49,234
- Rufus, what are you doing here?
- I'd like to talk to your mother.

536
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:51,959
- She doesn't want.
- Rufus, what is it?

537
00:29:52,421 --> 00:29:53,871
The truth, finally.

538
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,694
You want to tell her or should I?

539
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,114
So S's father sends her
this letter saying that

540
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:04,093
he and Lily were together
when she see him.

541
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,253
Hoping it would cause problems
between them,

542
00:30:06,378 --> 00:30:07,968
maybe even split 'em up.

543
00:30:08,093 --> 00:30:11,721
- When that failed, he went to plan "B"
- Getting Holland to befriend Rufus.

544
00:30:11,846 --> 00:30:14,483
Holland's husband was leaving her,
and she was desperate for a friend.

545
00:30:14,608 --> 00:30:17,195
But once again,
Rufus and Lily proved too solid,

546
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,070
- so on to plan "C"...
- there's a plan "C"?

547
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:22,653
I always have a plan "C."

548
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,471
Put yourself
in the good doctor's loafers.

549
00:30:25,596 --> 00:30:28,492
Lily comes to him over
the summer. She's actually sick.

550
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,997
He cures her, falls in love,
decides to win her back,

551
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:36,513
Only Holland tells him Lily
and Rufus are copper-bottom.

552
00:30:37,292 --> 00:30:40,047
He thinks, "what can I do
to get her to love me...

553
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,547
The family to accept me?"

554
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:45,134
Save her life.
So the pills he gets from Holland,

555
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:46,717
The ones you stole.

556
00:30:46,842 --> 00:30:50,044
Antibiotics, the side effects
of which mimic her symptoms.

557
00:30:50,169 --> 00:30:53,350
He cures her again, gets to be the hero,
and they live happily ever after.

558
00:30:54,297 --> 00:30:56,047
No wonder you admire him.

559
00:30:56,172 --> 00:30:58,194
It's almost like
something you would do.

560
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:01,314
Thank you. It does have
the fingerprints of my genius.

561
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:02,982
The only question now is...

562
00:31:03,107 --> 00:31:04,857
Will Lily believe my dad?

563
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:09,200
Lily, this is absurd.
You cannot believe his lies.

564
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,321
Should I call Holland?
She'll tell the truth.

565
00:31:11,446 --> 00:31:14,038
So you get your mistress
to change her story and

566
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:17,166
Is my mom really sick?
Right now that's all I wanna know.

567
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,126
Of course she was sick.

568
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,860
To even imagine that
I would prescribe your mother

569
00:31:21,985 --> 00:31:23,506
medication that she didn't need?

570
00:31:24,034 --> 00:31:25,257
It's preposterous.

571
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,594
I've got the files in my bag.
Do you want to see them?

572
00:31:29,246 --> 00:31:31,396
You don't have to prove yourself.

573
00:31:39,437 --> 00:31:40,787
Apparently, I do.

574
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,474
- Excuse me.
- William.

575
00:31:55,911 --> 00:31:57,761
I didn't cheat on you, Lil.

576
00:31:58,156 --> 00:31:59,955
- I would never cheat on you.
- Rufus.

577
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,710
So she's not sick?

578
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,252
- I just want to be clear.
- She's not sick anymore.

579
00:32:04,377 --> 00:32:07,677
He's been lying since he got
to new york, to all of us.

580
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,297
- Do you think he's even coming back?
- Yes, of course he is.

581
00:32:10,422 --> 00:32:12,016
You heard what he said.

582
00:32:12,141 --> 00:32:15,182
And I'm sorry, mom.
I don't want you to be sick.

583
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,184
But dad is not lying to us.

584
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,650
Where's william?

585
00:32:25,532 --> 00:32:27,403
He's in the lobby downstairs
getting his bags.

586
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,321
There's no one in the lobby.

587
00:32:29,627 --> 00:32:32,527
- He's down there.
- Serena, the lobby's empty.

588
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:36,357
Youjust must not have seen him.
He wouldn't leave.

589
00:32:36,482 --> 00:32:38,032
He wouldn't leave me.

590
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,750
- Let her go.
- Oh, God.

591
00:32:43,372 --> 00:32:44,953
We should call the police.

592
00:32:45,078 --> 00:32:46,662
Let's just give him a minute.

593
00:32:46,787 --> 00:32:49,287
No. If we wait,
he'll be gone for good.

594
00:32:51,481 --> 00:32:53,461
Yes, captain Lewis?
This is Nate Archibald.

595
00:32:53,586 --> 00:32:57,099
<i>We met at my grandfather's this summer.
Listen, I need a favor.</i>

596
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:02,142
What I'd like to know is how did
william know to get out of town?

597
00:33:02,267 --> 00:33:04,417
Someone must have tipped him off.

598
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,652
It had to be one of us.

599
00:33:09,837 --> 00:33:11,113
It was me.

600
00:33:28,818 --> 00:33:29,923
What happened?

601
00:33:32,567 --> 00:33:34,017
It's true. He left.

602
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:08,754
I need you to tell me the truth.

603
00:34:14,894 --> 00:34:18,180
When your mother came to me
last summer, she was sick.

604
00:34:19,317 --> 00:34:20,417
I cured her.

605
00:34:22,198 --> 00:34:24,448
Then I fell in love with her again.

606
00:34:24,803 --> 00:34:27,253
When I came here
and saw you and Eric,

607
00:34:27,683 --> 00:34:30,083
I realized how badly
I had messed up.

608
00:34:33,476 --> 00:34:35,470
I never wanted to hurt any of you.

609
00:34:35,595 --> 00:34:37,479
I just wanted my family back.

610
00:34:37,604 --> 00:34:39,410
All you needed to do was be here.

611
00:34:41,201 --> 00:34:42,371
I'm sorry, Serena.

612
00:34:42,779 --> 00:34:45,666
I just thought
unless your mother needed me...

613
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:51,019
You weren't gonna give me a chance.

614
00:34:52,578 --> 00:34:56,378
Well, the police are on their way now,
So you should probably go.

615
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,904
Why don't you come with me?

616
00:35:00,603 --> 00:35:02,103
I don't forgive you.

617
00:35:02,842 --> 00:35:04,277
I also don't need to punish you.

618
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:08,152
So if you just go now, I'll make
sure they don't come after you.

619
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:12,943
I love you, Serena.

620
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:15,998
I love you, too, dad.

621
00:35:22,183 --> 00:35:23,183
Go now.

622
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:03,425
Rufus, I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
I was just so overwhelmed.

623
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:07,211
The only thing that matters
is I'm not losing you.

624
00:36:07,336 --> 00:36:10,378
To cancer, to will or anything else.

625
00:36:25,846 --> 00:36:27,935
Really? That's it?

626
00:36:28,676 --> 00:36:32,189
Dad, she believed you cheated.
She was leaving with her ex-husband.

627
00:36:32,495 --> 00:36:33,957
And you helped make that happen.

628
00:36:34,082 --> 00:36:36,443
You know, you think that
William's the only problem?

629
00:36:37,526 --> 00:36:40,601
<i>He's not, dad.
You and Lily fight all the time.</i>

630
00:36:40,726 --> 00:36:43,212
One of you thinks the other's
cheating. You both keep secrets.

631
00:36:43,337 --> 00:36:45,728
Jenny, that's between me and Lily.

632
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:47,553
You know, I wish it was,

633
00:36:47,678 --> 00:36:50,978
But we all get dragged into it,
just like we did today.

634
00:36:51,366 --> 00:36:54,008
When we lived in brooklyn, I might have
had to take the subway to school

635
00:36:54,133 --> 00:36:57,381
and make my own clothes,
but at least our family was happy.

636
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:01,134
I don't see what's so wrong about
wanting my life to go back to normal.

637
00:37:01,611 --> 00:37:04,888
This is where we live.
What needs to get back to normal is you.

638
00:37:16,207 --> 00:37:18,693
If you don't want to be
a part of this family,

639
00:37:18,818 --> 00:37:20,904
No one is forcing you to stay.

640
00:37:45,672 --> 00:37:47,228
You don't have to wait with me.

641
00:37:47,353 --> 00:37:49,016
Lily is fine, and the sting is over.

642
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,185
You're not really going to keep
up this rugby player facade.

643
00:37:52,841 --> 00:37:56,599
It's not a facade.
It's a date, and he's on his way.

644
00:38:03,094 --> 00:38:04,912
I know you felt it.

645
00:38:06,096 --> 00:38:09,244
We were caught up in a scheme,
and it was role-play.

646
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,458
It was real.

647
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,835
I know you feel it right now.

648
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,040
It doesn't change anything.

649
00:38:20,811 --> 00:38:23,133
And Holland may be crazy,
but she was right.

650
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:26,219
No matter what I feel or don't,
we're not safe.

651
00:38:28,007 --> 00:38:31,683
I did the most dangerous thing I could
when I said "I love you,"

652
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,230
And it was worth it.

653
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,900
If I got through my fear for you,

654
00:38:37,936 --> 00:38:39,816
You can get through yours for me.

655
00:38:43,892 --> 00:38:46,831
You have until tomorrow to decide.

656
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,158
What?

657
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,276
We're never going to be safe.

658
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,289
So are you brave enough
or aren't you?

659
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,833
I'll be waiting at the top
of the Empire State building.

660
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,447
You can't "affair to remember" me.

661
00:39:01,996 --> 00:39:03,715
If you're not there tomorrow,

662
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,093
at 7:01 I'm closing
my heart to you forever.

663
00:39:07,716 --> 00:39:09,366
Well, I won't be there.

664
00:39:29,425 --> 00:39:30,875
How'd the sting go?

665
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:35,769
I'd much rather hear about rugby.

666
00:39:36,267 --> 00:39:40,116
Fair enough.
Rugby is a real sport. Football's for...

667
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,563
- Hello?
- I've been calling you.

668
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:03,531
There's nothing more to say.
I got to my dad before the cops did.

669
00:40:03,656 --> 00:40:07,256
So I guess now you know
why I don't talk to you about things.

670
00:40:24,909 --> 00:40:26,711
Thanks for coming with me.

671
00:40:26,836 --> 00:40:28,829
I know this was
a complicated one for you.

672
00:40:28,954 --> 00:40:32,504
When are things not complicated
with Serena Van Der Woodsen?

673
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:38,101
You want to talk about it?

674
00:40:46,548 --> 00:40:48,442
<i>When the family tree falls,</i>

675
00:40:48,567 --> 00:40:51,364
<i>we all need a friend to lead us
out of the woods...</i>

676
00:40:56,476 --> 00:40:57,626
<i>Or into them.</i>

677
00:41:07,453 --> 00:41:09,353
I didn't know you'd be here.

678
00:41:09,478 --> 00:41:10,592
I live here.

679
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,805
I know. I just thought you'd,
be with Serena or something.

680
00:41:15,211 --> 00:41:16,211
Nope.

681
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:31,234
<i>But careful, once darkness descends,</i>

682
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,976
<i>true natures emerge,
and everything is fair game</i>

683
00:41:35,881 --> 00:41:37,081
<i>until morning.</i>

684
00:41:37,499 --> 00:41:39,810
<i>X.O.X.O., Gossip Girl.</i>
