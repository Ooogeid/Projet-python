Gossip girl here--your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,070
They wanna take our money?

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,340
Not yet, but they have frozen our accounts.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,910
You can take care of this...

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,920
With my help.

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,210
And what would i have to do for you?

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,330
This is so messed up.

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,650
Your ex dating my stepson?

9
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,710
Yes, it is.

10
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,070
I didn't sign up for some creepy love triangle with you and someone's mom!

11
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,080
She's giving mmoney.

12
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,080
You have no idi how i feel about nate and what i would do to keep him.

13
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,630
Do you wanna be with this woman?

14
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,670
No, i wanna be with you.

15
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,250
I am out for good.

16
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,680
In spite of my lowly, unroyal ways, 

17
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,020
accept that i have true feelings for rcus and that he has them for me, too.

18
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,910
Blair?

19
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,440
Marcus!

20
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,780
No, i knew it was him, but i want you.

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,370
You want my title, which makes me a fool.

22
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,510
I do want you.

23
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,960
Then show me.

24
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,170
Well, i was on a...

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,450
On--on a date?

26
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,280
Yeah, i was gonna tell you guys i've been dating.

27
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,040
We keep having this same fight.

28
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,860
I can't change who i am.

29
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,940
Me neither.

30
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,070
When i step out of here, it's over.

31
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,540
I think it was already.

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,010
And who am i?

33
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,190
That's a secret i'll never tell.

34
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,710
You know you love me.

38
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,960
Wakey, wakey, upper east siders.

39
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,450
Welcome to the first day of senior year and the onset of a new social dynasty.

40
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,740
The big question is, with serena single and on top of the world, 

41
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,020
will constance become the house of van der woodsen?

42
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,220
I can't believe you got bart to wear flip-flops.

43
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,980
I can't even picture that.It was so cute.

44
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,470
Every time we'd go for a walk on the beach.

45
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,400
I'd catch him staring down at his feet.

46
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,030
Mom, it all sounds so romantic.

47
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,980
Are we expecting more people?

48
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,670
Well, um, it is your first day of school, and i was trying to be motherly.

49
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,280
Mom, i can't believe you didn't wake me up when you got home last night.

50
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,160
I feel cheated.

51
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,910
Last time, you said you felt violated.

52
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,910
- Welcome home
- say "mom," and i will kill you in your sleep.\

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,420
Decaf, serena.I was going to say "mrs.Bass.

54
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,160
" thank you, charles.

55
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,230
Um, bart had to fly to beijing on business, but he sends his best.

56
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,250
As he has done since kindergarten.

57
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,050
Okay.

58
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,720
Hello.We were talking romantic getaway, walking on the beach.Details.

59
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,260
I could stay home, and then we could go to lunch together.

60
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,170
- Stay home?It's your first day of
- serena and dan broke up.

61
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,830
Tragic, if not entirely unprecedented.

62
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,140
Not without an upside.

63
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,850
Humphrey was holding you back.

64
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,750
You're a born queen.

65
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,640
This is your ymcr to rule.

66
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,370
- Why fight it?
- Because i don't want it, okay?

67
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,370
Being queen is blair's whole thing.

68
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,260
Plus, if she needs a eunuch, she knows where to look.

69
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,470
You may feel differently when the trumpets call.

70
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,100
Grab the o.J.

71
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,930
There's champagne in the limo.

72
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,270
He--he's kidding...

73
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,390
I think.

74
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,420
Well, so you broke up.

75
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,160
I didn't even know you two were back together.

76
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:56,990
Yeah.

77
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:57,800
Are you okay?

78
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,380
No, but i will be...

79
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,790
I hope.

80
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,450
I don't know.Having to see him every day, it's--it's gonna be really hard.

81
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,210
Well, you know what?Every day gets a little bit easier.

82
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,030
Yeah.

83
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,310
It'll be fine, right?

84
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,600
Of coqrse it will.I mean, we--we broke up amicably.

85
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,970
No one cheated.No one screamed.

86
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,430
You've got nothing to worry about.

87
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,400
Of course, i don't know what the post breakup protocol is these days.

88
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,070
Yeah, like she gets the courtyard mondays, wednesdays, fridays, 

89
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,710
and i get supervised visits with the library every other weekend.

90
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,840
You know, be honest with where you're both at.

91
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,110
Just do that, okay?

92
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,590
And the deflection through sarcasm thing you might want to put on the back burner for a while.

93
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,900
I, uh, i heard your friend sneak out early this morning.

94
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,400
Clare, is it?

95
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,320
Come on.

96
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,150
High heels, concrete loft-- not the blueprint for a-a stealthy getaway.

97
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,930
Sorry.Uh, back burner starting now.

98
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,000
How are tings going anyway?

99
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,270
Uh, it's early, so let's keep thibetween us, okay?

100
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,180
Hey.

101
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,570
You look great, sweetie.

102
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,230
Excited for the big first day?

103
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,910
Dad, how, uh, set are you on this whole going-to-school thing?

104
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,350
Pretty set.Why?

105
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,260
The first day of school is draft day.

106
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,190
Blair and her merry band of psychos are gonna be on the tear.

107
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,280
They categorize girls into two groups-- projects and victims.

108
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,360
Girls with the potential to become little mini blair-ites become projects and total losers, 

109
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,310
and the girls who have the potential to threaten social order become victims.

110
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,120
I was a project last year, and we all know how that turned out.

111
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,630
What?

112
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,020
Nothing.Totally with you.

113
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:36,950
Did you understand any of that?

114
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,580
I-i'm so glad i'm not a girl.

115
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,950
Melissa murphy, junior.

116
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,830
Let's see here.

117
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,830
A.P.Scores good...

118
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,150
Decent charity work...

119
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
Young women of the american ballet theater...

120
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,310
Season passes to the knicks?

121
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,880
My dad's the team doctor.

122
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,540
Where did you say you summered again?

123
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,100
The adirondacks.

124
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,150
We'll be in touch.

125
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,370
* we're gonna have a good day * and ain't nobody gotta cry today * 

126
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,230
so you're basically using blair's 73stem to screen potential dates?

127
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,330
Think of it as an early application process.

128
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,870
So many slots on the chuck bass social calendar.

129
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,580
It'll save me a ton of time.

130
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,150
It seems a bit impersonal.

131
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,100
Thank you.

132
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,040
Are those last season's tory burch flats?

133
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,590
I...

134
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,470
Got them on sale?

135
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,080
* we're gonna have a good day * 

136
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,470
and all my homies gonna ride today * 

137
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,880
* and all these mommies look fly today* 

138
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,460
* and all we wanna do is get by today * 

139
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,780
* hey, we're gonna have a good day * 

140
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,680
* and ain't nobody gotta cry today * 

141
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,040
* 'cause ain't nobody nna die today * 

142
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,450
what is wrong with me?

143
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,640
Oh.

144
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,840
And my brother goes to dalton.

145
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,100
Lacrosse captain.

146
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,190
Cute friends.

147
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,360
* hey, we're gonna have a good day * lunch.

148
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,830
1:00 sharp.

149
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,670
Every year the projects pile shrinks while the victims pile...

150
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,850
I blame the voucher system.

151
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,480
It's like the government doesn't even care.

152
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,730
Last minute transfer.

153
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,540
I thought you should be up-to-date.

154
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,690
Dates will not be my problem this year.

155
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:29,020
Thanks to your little performance last week, the hrd and i are better than ever.

156
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,690
Now if you'll excuse me...

157
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,660
I have to find serena.

158
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,970
Vanessa, hey.

159
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,110
- Wait up.
- Nate, what are you doing here?

160
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,980
Uh, you haven't returned my phone calls.

161
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,420
I've been busy.

162
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,010
No, wait.Just hold on for a second.

163
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,730
You crash the party and you tell me to break it off with catherine 

164
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,630
and then you pull an 180 and you tell me to stay with her and then you just bolt.

165
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,840
I-i mean, did i do something, or--or what happened?

166
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,730
I'm late.

167
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,200
Whoa, whoa.So--so that's it?

168
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,940
I mean, we're not even friends now?

169
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,540
We were never really friends, nate.

170
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,060
You'd be the worst p.I.Ever.

171
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,660
Well, i don't want to be caught off guard.

172
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,110
I'm so surprised i haven't seen her.

173
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,480
Yeah, especially 'cause you're in the girls hallway looking for her.

174
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,640
Just be nice.

175
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,930
I'm sure this isn't easy for serena either.

176
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,730
It was--it was like i didn't even exist.

177
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,900
Welcome to my world.

178
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,560
It's not so bad once you get used to birds flying into your head and automatic doors never opening.

179
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,480
Yeah.

180
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,780
Well, i guess it's better to be ignored than tortured, right?

181
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,090
Well, there's looking on the bright side.

182
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,130
Uh, you know what?I should head to my side of the building.Good luck.

183
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,550
Oh!Oh, i'm sorry, man.

184
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,120
Oh!

185
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,260
I'm--i'm so sorry.

186
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,480
Let me get those for you.

187
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,010
Oh, thanks.

188
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,160
Amanda.

189
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,010
I just transferred in.

190
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,100
I'm dan.

191
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,580
I-i just assaulted you.

192
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,720
- Welcome.
- I just hid there.

193
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,880
How pathetic is that?

194
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,390
No, don't answer that.

195
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,070
Breakups are easy.

196
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,190
It's having to see them date someone alse that's hard.

197
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,520
Why do you think i rub it in chuck's face every chance i get?

198
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,320
A twisted version of foreplay?

199
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,620
Ignoring you.

200
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,670
You're, uh, you're reading the new harris novel.

201
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,790
Have you ever read him?

202
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,160
Read him, i've listened to him, i've fetched him his morning irish coffee.

203
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,200
I interned for him this summer.

204
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,420
The point is, whoever dates first wins.

205
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,310
And with your ex being dan humphrey, you win by default.

206
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:54,190
Looks like humphrey defied our great expectations and waldorf's rules o order.

207
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,520
Daring to date before serena?

208
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,770
It's only a matter of time before it's off with his head...

209
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,150
Or hers.

210
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,080
The file is sketchy.

211
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,160
- She just transferred in.
- Her father's with the u.N.

212
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,250
, she's traveled the world, she won the short fiction award at her last school.

213
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,020
- Blair, do you mind?
- S.

214
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,180
, this girl is dan with boobs.

215
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,930
Do you really want to see them read together all year?

216
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,270
Move her to the front of the line.

217
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,450
Look, i appreciate it, but you're making way too big a deal out of this.

218
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,040
So he was talking to someone.

219
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,110
So what?

220
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,090
It--it--it doesn't mean anytng.

221
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,900
I'm fine.

222
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,200
She's not fine.

223
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,290
Call her a person of interest.

224
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,770
* you call me the observer * is that what i am to you?

225
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:49,820
* i only want to uncover * a different point of view what a lovely little gallery.

226
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,840
What are you doing here?

227
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,600
I know nate paid you a visit this morning, and i just wanted to thank you, 

228
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,780
you, show my appreciation for respecting our agreement.

229
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,610
Great.You can show me by leaving.

230
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,530
See, i was thinking something a little more tangible.

231
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,150
What is this?

232
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,600
Open it and see.

233
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,280
** unbelievable.

234
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,130
You really think that...

235
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,000
Hey.

236
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,930
Hey.

237
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,480
I-i just, uh...

238
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,750
I waved.

239
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,880
I was wondering when i'd bump into you.

240
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,310
So how's your, uh, how's your first day going?

241
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,870
Or something slightly less clich?

242
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,540
Good.Uh, yeah.School's...

243
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,510
School.Yeal

244
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,580
Wow.This is...

245
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,650
You know, i-i've been really nervous about seeing you all week.

246
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,990
In fact, i still am.

247
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,860
You were?

248
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:05,840
- Yeah.
- You are?

249
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,320
Uh, l-look, why don't we just fast-forward past all this-- this weirdness and be friends?

250
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,320
That sounds so good.

251
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,340
What are you doing for lunch today?

252
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,800
Friends eat lunch together, right?

253
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,320
They--you're right.They do.

254
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,260
Uh, the thing is, i-- dan.Hey.

255
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,790
Uh, amanda, this is serena.

256
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,290
Amanda's new, so i sort of already asked her if she, uh...

257
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,550
Right.

258
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,550
Great.Well...

259
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,650
Um...

260
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,960
Welcome.

261
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,000
I hope you have...

262
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,860
I'll see you...Later.

263
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,080
Who would have thought humphrey would be the one to move on first?

264
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,790
They look very sweet together.

265
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,150
Did i overhear something about a lunch?

266
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,650
Class schedule.New girl.Now.

267
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:31,950
Lily?

268
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,480
Hello, rufus.

269
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,120
What are you doing?

270
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,830
I had no idea you were here.

271
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,730
How was the trip?

272
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,670
How--how's bart?

273
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,580
Good.Good.

274
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,690
Um, he's still in beijing.

275
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,510
Oh.

276
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,960
On business, you know.

277
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,400
So...

278
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,010
What brings you down here, lily?

279
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:56,440
Oh, i just thought it would be nice to, um, to say hello, maybe catch up.

280
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,230
actually i wa on my way out.

281
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,320
of course.I should have called first.

282
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,330
- You're busy with work and
- no, i just...

283
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,310
"repo man" is playing at the sunshine.

284
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,390
You know how i love my harry dean stanton.

285
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,650
Playing hooky?

286
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,410
Yeah, don't tell anyone.

287
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,040
Not if you take me with you.

288
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,990
You want to go to "repo man"?

289
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,000
Yeah.

290
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,730
As i recall, we went to "repo man" once, and you walked out.

291
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,720
Well, that was 20 years ago.

292
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,180
- And you stole my soda]
- well, i'll buy you another.

293
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,110
All right.

294
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,760
Let's go to "repo man.

295
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,050
" hi.

296
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,500
My name's blair.You're new.

297
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,350
Hi.

298
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,890
- I'm aman
- oh, that's not important.

299
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,240
We'd like to invite you to lunch.

300
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,100
That's really sweet, but i'm already-- we know.

301
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,550
Dan humphrey--bad idea.

302
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,150
It could be hazardous to your health-- social, emotional.

303
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,060
Even physical.

304
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,480
Ouch!

305
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,880
Besides, boyfriends are so much less reliable than girlfriends.

306
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,600
We look out for each other.

307
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,830
What do you say?

308
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,030
Blair?

309
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,850
What's going on?

310
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,940
This is amanda.

311
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,390
She'll be joining us for lunch.

312
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,260
Blair.

313
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,540
It's for your own good, s.

314
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:14,200
They were going to lunch together-- lunch, as in the meal before dating.

315
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,530
Is that what you want?

316
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,480
Exactly.

317
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,430
Would you grab my stick?

318
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,120
I seemed to have dropped it.

319
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,080
Lady catherine is unavailable.

320
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,740
Would you care to leave a message?

321
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,500
If i could just leave this for her, i'm sure she'll get it.

322
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,230
Can i just...

323
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,330
Very well.

324
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,460
She's not coming--amanda.

325
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,320
What are you talking about?

326
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,280
She met some new friends.

327
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,580
To her for lunch.

328
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,590
Hockey sticks were involved.

329
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,480
You know how persuasive our girls can be.

330
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,910
Okay, but why?

331
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,390
??????????????????She'll be bound by their laws.

332
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,510
Namely, she won't be allowed to date ex-boyfriends.

333
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,560
Namely you.

334
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,080
No, serena wouldn't do that.

335
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,560
Prove me wrong.

336
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,210
- Vanessa.
- Hey.

337
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,920
i'm sorry i can't right now

338
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,930
What kind of emergency?

339
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,540
This is wrong.Eating here?

340
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,810
I know, but the met steps are totally under construction.

341
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,180
No, blair, i mean...

342
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,450
Amanda?

343
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,860
Amanda, we have a few ground rules here.

344
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,180
For lunch?

345
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:26,110
Now that we're all friends, you should know that dating someone's ex is frowned upon.

346
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,980
For instance, serena and dan used to-- oh.

347
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:29,950
I didn't know.

348
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,840
Of course you didn't.That's what friends are for.

349
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,000
But now that you know...

350
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:33,920
You understand.

351
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,950
- Pretty sure
- yeah.

352
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,550
Pretty sure?

353
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,480
Uh, hey, amanda, would you mind getting some gelato?

354
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,210
There's a-a cart right out there on the street.

355
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,460
My treat.

356
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,870
I don't like this, b.

357
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,120
, and i'm not gonna do it, okay?

358
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,210
I'm gonna go find dan and apologize.

359
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,920
It's for your own good, s.

360
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:01,870
So this is...

361
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,910
Yeah.

362
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,250
- And they were about to
- that's before kickoff, but yep.

363
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,490
God, why can't i look away?

364
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,750
Seriously.

365
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,500
Uh, so what are you gonna about nate?Are you gonna tell him?

366
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,520
How can i?

367
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,150
He would most likely freak out.

368
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,230
Oh, there's no question about that.

369
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,120
And i can't confront catherine because the butler will remember me and-- 

370
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,080
and she'll drop the dime on the captain.

371
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,100
Sorry.That's the only chance i'll ever get to talk like that.

372
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,470
How can i use this to get nate off the hook?

373
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,920
I mean, what do i do?

374
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,950
Well, you're-- you're not gonna like it.

375
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,350
Blair.

376
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,540
- Blair?
- Mm-hmm.

377
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,600
I can't trust blair.

378
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,610
Well, maybe not, but google "revenge," you get blairwaldorf.Com.

379
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,900
Look, she--she helped me with georgina.

380
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,290
She'll know what to do, and when she sees this photo, 

381
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,470
she will be plenty motivated to do it.

382
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,700
So i have to show this to blair?

383
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:47,130
Yeah.I mean, i'd wear protective padding when you do it, but--but yeah.

384
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:48,840
Look, v.I gotta go.

385
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,670
There's this thing with serena.

386
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,760
Everything okay?

387
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,080
Um...

388
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,820
Yeah, well, we'll see.

389
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,810
Dan.Hey.

390
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,520
I want to apologize.

391
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,850
And that answers my question.

392
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,920
Look, blair invited her to lunch, not me.

393
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,350
But you were there at lunch.

394
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,860
Yeah, but--but then i left, and i told blair to stop.

395
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,780
So you were part of it, and then you had second thoughts?

396
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,700
Dan, i'm trying to apologize.

397
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,390
Real 'cause it sounds like you're just trying to rationalize.

398
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,370
It's--it's just--we knew that this would be awkward.

399
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,490
You know?

400
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:34,160
And i-i just assumed that it would be more of a sad awkward, not this copetitive awkward.

401
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,320
I-i didn't think you'd enlist backup.

402
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:37,960
Is that what you think i'm doing?

403
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,470
Well, you tell mml if--if i have lunch with someone else tomorrow, 

404
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,590
are blair's minions gonna break her fingers?

405
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,460
Just so you know, if this were a competition, 

406
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,230
i wouldn't need blair and her posse to win.

407
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,250
Hey.

408
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,430
Hey.

409
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:03,180
Aren't you supposed to not be talking to me, or you'll be shunned or something?

410
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,980
I don't like bullies.

411
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,820
Oh.

412
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,610
So my question-- what are we doing tonight?

413
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,780
I'm so sorry, blair.

414
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,280
Like i said, catherine knows where the captain is.

415
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,270
She threatened to expose him if i er took nate away from her.

416
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,360
- But with this, i was hoping that you might be able
- who else knows?

417
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,050
What?

418
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,650
Who's seen this?

419
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:28,870
Dan.

420
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,010
Just dan.

421
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:40,430
If you or humphrey ever breathe a word of this-- 

422
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,200
one word to anyone-- you'll regret it for the rest of your lives.

423
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,440
Do you understand?

424
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,240
I just want nate free from catherine.

425
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,060
I don't want him or anyone else finding out about this.

426
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,730
Good.

427
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,450
I'll take care of it.

428
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,310
I'm trusting you, blair.

429
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,420
Like you have a choice.

430
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:20,610
* oh, oh, oh * oh, oh, oh * oh, oh, oh 

431
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,660
so are you sure you want to eat here?

432
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,210
'Cause this is, uh, i'm thinking this is maybe not a great idea.

433
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,270
Why?Everyone comes here.

434
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,510
Dan, it's time to send a message.

435
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,890
** i am not sharing my lump crab.

436
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,040
** check it out.

437
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,660
???????????????Is his business.

438
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,480
But when he brings his new maiden to court...

439
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,280
I can't believe he brought her here.

440
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,370
It's a declaration of war.

441
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,920
Sound the trumpets, strumpets.

442
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,820
What were you thinking?

443
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,150
Wh-- i-i was sleeping.

444
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,520
????????????? our gossip girl

445
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,420
" oh, no, her--her name's amanda.

446
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,840
Oh, her name's amanda.

447
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,530
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

448
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,990
Not only is it social suicide, dan, it's mean.

449
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,670
Do you really think serena deserves to be treated like this?

450
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,780
Uh, no.Look, she started with this girl mafia.

451
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,570
Oh, forget about them.

452
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,980
You need to talk to her.

453
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:28,020
Apologize before it's too late.

454
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,570
G--chuck!

455
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,500
Boundaries.

456
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,430
Get out.

457
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,350
Good morning to you, too.I had margaurite make you up a little something.

458
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,240
I missed you at S.T.K.Last night.

459
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,340
Mom and i had a girls' movie night.

460
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,580
She made me watch "paris, texas.

461
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,930
" she kept talking about how amazing harry dean stanton was.

462
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:03,510
Well, i just wanted to make sure you got your breakfast and the morning headlines, especially this one.

463
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,440
Vanessa?

464
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,960
What are you doing here?

465
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,840
Believe it or not, i'm looking for blair.

466
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,040
Why?What has she done?

467
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,880
Nothing that i can tell.

468
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,260
That's the problem.

469
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,980
She won't return any of my calls.

470
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,220
Is there any way you can find out where she is?

471
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,120
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.

472
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,950
Yeah.

473
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,710
Are you lost?

474
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,700
I'm looking for blair.

475
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,000
She took the morning off.

476
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,370
She's having brunch at centolire, but i'm sure she wouldn't want to see you.

477
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,490
Well, thanks.

478
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,630
Oh, little j.

479
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,560
, just because we've been ignoring you doesn't mean we've forgotten.

480
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,050
You can't hide out at eleanor waldorf's atelier anymore.

481
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,380
Your day will come.

482
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,390
We're just picking our moment.

483
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,260
- Serena 
- so this is how you want to handle it, 

484
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,220
using anotr girl to embarrass me in front of my friends?

485
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,110
Is that your idea of sending a message, dan?

486
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,450
Well, that--that phrase might have been used, but

487
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,510
i can't believe you would do that.

488
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,000
Look, i know, and i'm sorry.

489
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,790
I was wrong.

490
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,720
Yes, you were.

491
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,110
I would never try to humiliate you like that.

492
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,700
No, but you would try to coerce girl not too out with me in the first place.

493
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,150
Fine.

494
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,280
Tonight, the three of us.

495
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,040
Okay.

496
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,750
What?

497
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,510
Look, you're gonna date other people, and i'm gonna date other people.

498
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,020
We can either let everyone else tell us how we should be jealous and compete, 

499
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,820
or we can just deal with it and try to preserve at least a little of our friendship.

500
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,140
So you, me and amanda are having a date?

501
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,550
I'd rather you not put it that way, but yes.

502
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,520
8:00.

503
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,340
yeah, it's a...

504
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,420
Uh, 8:00.

505
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,600
okay.

506
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,500
This shouldn't be weird at all.

507
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,910
i-i can't wait for you to join us at markworth for the holidays-- 

508
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:36,600
snow on the grounds, crackling fire, just the two of us under the stars.

509
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,950
You sure it won't be awkward?

510
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,260
Awkward?

511
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,220
How?

512
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,120
Juggling two women under one roof.

513
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,960
You are sleeping with catherine, right?

514
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,540
Or do you prefer "mom"?

515
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,600
I can explain.

516
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,590
Hooking up with your dad's second wife?

517
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:56,140
I thought my family was twisted, but you people take the cake.

518
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:00,300
It's only happened a few times, and i put a stop to it when i met you.

519
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,670
I really opened myself up to you.

520
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,100
- Can't--can't we still
- oh, please.

521
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,930
I just want to get through this without throwing up in my mouth.

522
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,810
Get through what exactly?

523
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:13,850
I got your message.

524
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,440
What's going on here?

525
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,330
Take a seat.

526
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,120
I beg your pardon?

527
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:21,340
Oh, no.

528
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,270
Not yet...

529
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,230
But you will.

530
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,360
What do you want?

531
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,670
Let's talk about your exit strategy.

532
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,530
Lady catherine is not in.

533
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,960
I'm actually looking to speak to her husband.

534
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,030
There's something he needs to see.

535
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,220
Harris hated him.

536
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,810
He called rilke the mitch albom of the 19th century.

537
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:58,520
Rilke?

538
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,810
Rainer maria rilke?

539
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,460
"letters to a young poet"?

540
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,530
Yeah, i-i gave it to her, actually, but she never read it.

541
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,070
Thoughn her defense, she never read "tuesdays with morrie" either.

542
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,760
This comparison coming from a man who does h best wring sloshed at a pub.

543
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,310
????

544
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,260
????

545
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,030
Harris.

546
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,270
Oh.

547
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:18,670
Uh, you know what?

548
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,630
I'm gonna go get another glass.

549
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,870
Okay.

550
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,420
another soda?

551
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,430
Belvedere martini, two olives, please.

552
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,140
Doing okay, s.

553
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,280
I wille.

554
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,890
So don't be mad, but we may have something that'll cheer you up.

555
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,960
Several somethings, actually.

556
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,290
* standing there with nothing on * 

557
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,070
serena, this is jenns, captain of the dalton lacrosse team.

558
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,700
Can i buy you a drink?

559
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,410
* i said, "ooh, girl" 

560
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,610
um...

561
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,140
????

562
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,860
Even the most chivalrous knight is not above a little romantic retaliation.

563
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:06,160
It turns out lonely boy is a worthy opponent, and it's time for s.

564
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,760
To bring in the calvy.

565
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,360
????

566
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,270
This guy attacked in the crease, akes left.

567
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,550
I faked left.

568
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,040
He faked right, then i faked right, and then wham!

569
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,790
Oh!

570
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,960
Just laid him out.

571
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,750
Wow.

572
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,320
Amazing.

573
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,780
Yeah, that was a fascinating story.

574
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,850
It was much better than the one where you faked, 

575
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,140
uh, right and then left, and then you hit him.

576
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,880
Dan's not a big sports fan.

577
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,550
Yeah, i can see that.

578
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:36,810
Yeah, he likes poets and "letter to poets.

579
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,880
i'm gonna use the ladies room.

580
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,000
Oh.

581
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:42,750
You know what?

582
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,980
I need another drink.

583
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,350
I'll do this again.

584
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,180
Okay.

585
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:48,800
Okay.

586
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,200
Smokin' hot.

587
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,640
* she grabbed my hand, showed her booty to the dance floor * 

588
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,980
* and everything else, that was exactly like a freak show * 

589
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,220
* she like to work it and twerk it... * 

590
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,530
so is this your great peace plan?

591
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,090
You invite me out so you can rub lacrosse guy in my face?

592
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,150
I didn't plan this.

593
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,150
Yeah.Uh-huh.I'm sure.

594
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:10,560
What?

595
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,370
I thought it was okay that we date other people.

596
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,250
Well, you--you certainly picked a winner.

597
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,040
Well, he's fun, nonneurotic.

598
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,510
I thought thatould be a nice change.

599
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,610
That's classy, serena.

600
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:19,960
Thanks.

601
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,900
Classy?

602
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,980
Like you asking another girl out our first day back at school?

603
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,220
We were broken up.

604
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,150
So what, dan?

605
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,330
It hurt.

606
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,040
What did y expect?

607
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,330
I loved you, and just because we broke up, 

608
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,370
doesn't mean i can just turn it off like that.

609
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:51,890
All right.

610
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:52,640
Um...

611
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,260
May-maybe--maybe we should stay away from each other for a while.

612
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,090
Yeah, yore right.

613
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,250
You and amanda should probably go.

614
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,010
Are you ordering me to leave?

615
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,690
Consider it a suggestion.

616
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,090
Why should i go, dan?

617
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:16,900
These are my friends here, and it's not exactly your kind of place.

618
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,660
Fine.

619
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,380
cashing out so soon, humphrey?

620
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,120
You really should wear a bell.

621
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,600
Kinky.

622
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,490
I'll think about it.

623
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,380
I hope you're not leaving.

624
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,570
You're about to see the real serena.

625
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,510
I've seen enough.

626
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,010
not by half.

627
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,390
Hey, blair.

628
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,890
Um, what was so important that we couldn't discuss over the phone?

629
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,760
Well, i have some good news and some bad news.

630
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,590
The bad news is that your girlfriend catherine is a lying, 

631
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,970
manipulating whore sleeping with her epson.

632
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,230
Whoa.What?

633
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,150
catherine and marcus?

634
00:29:59,150 --> 00:29:59,750
I know.

635
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:00,780
It's hard to picture.

636
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,140
I have photos if you'd like to take a look.

637
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,290
I'm sorry.

638
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:08,890
But the good news is that i convinced them both to leave town.

639
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,360
- Well, h-how did you even
- and that's not even the best part.

640
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,240
Catherine and i made a deal.

641
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,930
I promised to keep my mouth shut, and she agreed to pay off the captain's restitution.

642
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,310
Congratulations, archibald.

643
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,370
Welcome back to your old life.

644
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,420
Look, i-i don't know-- 

645
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:23,960
wait.

646
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,310
Hold that nonthought.

647
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,730
Catherine, whatever it is, just spare me.

648
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,480
What do you mean?

649
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,050
Vanessa talked to the duke?

650
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,790
No, i told her to stay out of this.

651
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,340
Okay.

652
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,000
Maybe i only have bad news.

653
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,740
Serena's not thinking straight.

654
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,590
She's making this about dan.

655
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,650
It's the new girl that defied you.

656
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,140
What would you suggest?

657
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:01,240
Ninth grade, the danish exchange student who kept flirting with your junior prom date?

658
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,780
You still remember how to serve a nair-tini, don't you?

659
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,780
oh.

660
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,700
Lily, what-- what are you doing here?

661
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,690
Well, serena and i were supposed to have a movie night, 

662
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:24,520
but she cancelled, so i thought...

663
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:27,810
"pretty in pink.

664
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:31,880
" it's only a supporting role, but harry dean stanton is excellent.

665
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,530
It's 9:00 at night.

666
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,040
Oh.

667
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,950
- Well, i guess i should have called, but i just thought i'd take a chance
- lily...

668
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,710
What are you doing here?

669
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:42,760
I don't know.

670
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,130
Um...

671
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,920
Bart is being doing business, as he did most of our trip.

672
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,530
The kids are living their own lives, and my life...

673
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,490
Is in an empty house or in a crowded restaurant, 

674
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:03,200
and i don't know which one makes me feel more alone.

675
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:10,170
I need a friend, and that's why i came to see you yesterday.

676
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:10,990
I'm sorry, lily.

677
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,850
I...

678
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:15,480
Really am, but i can't be your friend.

679
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:21,770
Yesterday reminded me of how easy it is to fall back into old patterns.

680
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:26,750
I can't be your safety net anymore.

681
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,990
It's not fair.

682
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,230
You made your choice to be mrs.Bass.

683
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,530
You need to go do that.

684
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,250
We both need you to go do that.

685
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,280
Rufus?

686
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:39,270
Sorry i'm late.

687
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,330
Hey.

688
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,330
Uh, clare, this is lily.

689
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,260
Nice to meet you.

690
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:55,800
Okay.

691
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,850
This used to be your favorite.

692
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,310
Nate, it's vanessa again.

693
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,390
Call me as soon as you get this.

694
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:18,890
We need to talk.

695
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:19,870
It's important.

696
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,490
What did i tell you?

697
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,140
I told you to do nothing.

698
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,420
What, was that too difficult?

699
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,410
I thought i would leave doing nothing to you.

700
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,920
I was taking care of it.

701
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,280
How?

702
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,770
By having a romantic lunch with your boyfriend?

703
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:33,460
You know what i think?

704
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,900
I think you were so scared of anyone finding out who your boyfriend 

705
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,160
was screwin that you were willing to screw nate.

706
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:41,180
Catherine's husband promised that the captain would be safe.

707
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,670
It's over.

708
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,450
You know what i think?

709
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,450
I think i'd gotten catherine to agree to pay off the archibald debts 

710
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,520
and leave town in exchange for my silence.

711
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:54,390
Nate was about to have his old life back until you went to the duke.

712
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,360
He put them on a plane to london an hour ago.

713
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,280
So you're right.

714
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,510
It is over for nate, thanks to you.

715
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,070
Are you really going to do this?

716
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:16,920
Yes.

717
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,070
Why should serena be the one pulling her hair out?

718
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,680
Oopsy.

719
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,530
Look at what i've done.

720
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,800
Oh, god.My hair!

721
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,550
oh, my god.

722
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:38,770
Look at her hair.

723
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:39,920
What?

724
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,900
Is that girl's hair coming out?

725
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,330
She's freaking out.

726
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,500
It's her hair.

727
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,620
Totally gross!

728
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:52,720
Amanda.

729
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,520
Hey.

730
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,140
Amanda, wait!

731
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,230
No, dan.

732
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,210
Just leave me alone.

733
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,120
Dan.

734
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,410
I'm so sorry.

735
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:00,850
Is she okay?

736
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:01,910
No.No, don't.

737
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:02,600
D-don't what?

738
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,890
I didn't plan any of this.

739
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,020
It all--it all just happened.

740
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,390
That's the serena van der woodsen mantra, isn't it?

741
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,920
No--no fault, no responsibility, things just happen.

742
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,840
You know, you used to tell me that you were afraid that people couldn't see the real you.

743
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,100
Well, maybe you're the one who can't see yourself.

744
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,850
From--from where i'm standing, this is who you are.

745
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,450
Is that what you think of me?

746
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,020
????

747
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,240
????

748
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,450
????

749
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,570
Maybe it's time you did, too.

750
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,590
????

751
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:48,290
????

752
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,510
never again.

753
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,660
From now on, everything goes through me.

754
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,590
Welcome back, queen serena.

755
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:00,400
Consider us your humbled servants, 'cause if looks could kill, 

756
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,120
we wouldn't want to be dan humphrey.

757
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:10,810
Nate.

758
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,980
What are you doing here?

759
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,260
I came to apologize.

760
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,550
I didn't know what blair was doing with the deal and the money and...

761
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:22,190
You think i care about the money?

762
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,880
I mean, i asked you point-blank if anything was wrong.

763
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:27,610
You lied to me.

764
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:28,590
I had to.

765
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,570
I didn't know what to do.

766
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,890
What, so you confided in dan?

767
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,510
I mean, blair?

768
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:35,870
R everyone but me.

769
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,660
I gotta get to school.

770
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,040
So that's it?

771
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,300
We can't even be friends?

772
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,730
Well, we were never really friends, remember?

773
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,030
Hey, jenny.

774
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,560
What are you doing here so early?

775
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,490
Trying to avoid you.

776
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,690
Hard to believe, i know.

777
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,280
You know what i find hard to believe?

778
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,450
This handbag.

779
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:07,290
It belongs in the trash, which is where you probably found it.

780
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:07,960
Don't.

781
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,890
Ohright.

782
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,200
There may be stuff in here that you need.

783
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,630
Here you go.

784
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,920
Seriously?

785
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,830
That's the best you guys can do?

786
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:19,230
I have to say, i was pecting a little more now that you're seniors.

787
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,070
Our methods may lack imagination, 

788
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:24,940
but they're very effective especially over a long period of time.

789
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,670
Manda.

790
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,830
It's me-e--dan.

791
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,510
Dan again.

792
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,970
Uh, sorry to be calling you so early.

793
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:50,610
Look, i'm--i'm really sorry about last night.

794
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,580
If it matters at all, i don't think it was serena, 

795
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,460
even though i, uh, i blamed her pretty harshly.

796
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,670
Uh, a-anyway, call me.

797
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,230
Getting my hair burned off was not a part of the deal.

798
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,770
The casualties of war.

799
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,360
I don't get it.

800
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,600
You wanted me to pretend to like this guy so he could make his ex-girlfriend jealous?

801
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,300
Jealousy is a powerful emotion.

802
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,320
I had to create a monster if i was going to dethrone a queen.

803
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,410
Why do you care who's queen of the high school?

804
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,760
????

805
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:33,700
by the way, i hear you're going to boarding school in vermont.

806
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,900
Something to keep you warm.

807
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,880
You have the day off?

808
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,210
What holiday is it?

809
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,360
Uh, women's suffrage day.

810
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,280
So why are you wearing your uniform?

811
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,930
'Cause i forgot.

812
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,430
Anyway, it's almost fashion week.

813
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,670
There has to be something i can do.

814
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,840
Well, uh, the worktables are a mess.

815
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,530
Eleanor can't find half her patterns.

816
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:00,500
Why don't you do that?

817
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,700
Okay.

818
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:18,020
Blair, where were you yesterday?

819
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,510
- I was home, just taking care of
- serena!

820
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,060
Where are we going tonight?

821
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,820
The dalton guys keep texting us.

822
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,400
It was a feeding frenzy last night.

823
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,600
Hey, i left you four messages.

824
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,960
- You okay 
- yeah.

825
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,500
I-i wasn't feeling well.

826
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:31,770
Oh.

827
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,440
You poor thing.

828
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:44,930
I actually have to get the assignments i missed yesterday.

829
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:45,470
Oh.

830
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,510
Of course.

831
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,130
I'll see you later.

832
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,830
Wel, well, look who's back on top.

833
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,770
9ei wonder how that happened.

834
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,100
Wait.

835
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:10,350
Now that i think of it, i know exactly how that happened.

836
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,020
Hmm.

837
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,660
- * brooklyn, we go hard, we on the look for the advantage * 
- Hey.Uh.

838
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,730

839
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:41,790
*Rough it up a bit * we broke, but we rich at heart * 

840
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,700
let's get out of here.

841
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,670
* it's our time, put the lights on us * 

842
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,280
* war tactics, they make me sick * 

843
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,630
* got guns for the strength they lack * 

844
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:56,160
* so if you know another way, you can't look the other way * 

845
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:59,800
* you know another way * tell them so right to their face * 

846
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:13,790
* we think you're a joke, shove your hope where it don't shine * 

847
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:27,230

848
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,700

849
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,950

850
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,440
Sorry, lonely boy.

851
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,400
Don't say we didn't try to warn you.

852
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,940
But if queen s.

853
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,350
Will do this to d., are any of us safe?

854
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,650
Bow down or bow out.

855
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:46,750
X.O.X.O., gossip girl.
