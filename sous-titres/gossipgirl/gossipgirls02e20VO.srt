00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,530
Gossip girl here

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,000
Your one and only source

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,500
Take me now.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,867
Why?

5
00:00:07,934 --> 00:00:09,500
To prove that nothing matters.

6
00:00:09,567 --> 00:00:12,067
That's not the blair i want.

7
00:00:12,134 --> 00:00:13,643
What are you doing with this insect?

8
00:00:13,643 --> 00:00:15,368
Having the time of my life, thank you.

9
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:19,734
Serena is in "women's wearar daily." with poppy lifton.

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,734
Remember when we were savannah and svetlana.

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,001
I totally forgot about savannah and svetlana.

12
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:27,101
Andrew got caught in a riptide.

13
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:29,567
Yeah, if we had known, we wouldn't have even bothered you.

14
00:00:29,634 --> 00:00:31,185
-Is it over? -we've already lost one son.

15
00:00:31,186 --> 00:00:32,600
we weren't losing another.

16
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:35,034
So you excited for nate's big adventure this summer?

17
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:38,734
He told you about our backpacking trip?

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,734
i was talking about the internship at the mayor's office.

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,334
-i should go.  -Wait. stay.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,901
Mornings are simply more fun on the upper east side.

21
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:06,034
Our favorite things to wake up to--the sun in the sky,

22
00:01:06,101 --> 00:01:08,234
The nikkei on the rise

23
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,700
And a wake-up call from your latest lover

24
00:01:10,767 --> 00:01:13,067
- Or your best friend. - again, serena?

25
00:01:13,134 --> 00:01:16,067
-Good. you're up. -yes, i'm up, just like i was up yesterday

26
00:01:16,134 --> 00:01:18,134
And the morning before that.

27
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:20,134
Well, after the whole carter/chuck thing,

28
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:23,167
You can't blame me for wanting to check in on you.

29
00:01:23,234 --> 00:01:25,201
And as much as i appreciate the concern, s.,

30
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:27,167
My downward spiral is on the upturn.

31
00:01:27,234 --> 00:01:29,533
I'm at home in my p.j.s, eating french toast

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,067
With dorota.

33
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,734
Come on! what was that?

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,234
-Get off the phone!  -dorota has a cold.

35
00:01:37,301 --> 00:01:39,491
Dorota, i told you not to use

36
00:01:39,492 --> 00:01:41,834
your handkerchief in the table

37
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:43,533
It's disgusting.

38
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,301
Oh, it sounded like a car horn. it must have been on my end.

39
00:01:46,368 --> 00:01:48,400
Where are you?

40
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:51,700
I'm on 73rd and madison, headed to via quadronno

41
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:54,901
To get some pastries for our new-family breakfast.

42
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:57,000
Well, uh, if i wasn't so full on french toast,

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,707
I would ask you to bring me one. see you at school.

44
00:01:58,707 --> 00:01:59,833
And tell dorota to feel better.

45
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:09,232
I have here in my hands my first fan letter.

46
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:10,499
What, did you write it yourself?

47
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:12,866
No. no. "the new yorker" forwarded it to me.

48
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,133
Some kid read my story. he loved it.

49
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,167
Sent me his own story. i mean, he wants my opinion.

50
00:02:18,232 --> 00:02:20,700
But i figured it'd be good practice for yale

51
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,525
Since they make you do a crit with your classmates.

52
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:23,933
Oh, a fan that gives homework. lovely.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,557
Mm. what's this?

54
00:02:25,558 --> 00:02:27,167
it's my entry packet from yale that come to.

55
00:02:27,232 --> 00:02:30,332
There's just a couple of forms for you to fill out,

56
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:32,266
And then we're done. look at us. everything's working out.

57
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:35,266
You're in yale and jenny might actually make it to 16.

58
00:02:35,332 --> 00:02:36,916
That was a little touch-and-go there for a while.

59
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,566
Yes, but i still have 24 hours to mess up, so...

60
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:41,466
Uh, dad, i don't smell coffee.

61
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:43,533
Yeah, and the waffle iron is cold.

62
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,399
Oh, yeah. lily's doing breakfast today.

63
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:47,566
She wants to talk to us. ominous.

64
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:49,766
Or delicious. i mean, do you know how many types of jam

65
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,966
They have there? come on. we're gonna be late.

66
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:54,299
A lot.

67
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:58,067
Hey. i'll be there in a second.

68
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:00,566
Would you care to read my fan letter in person?

69
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:03,332
As happy as i am for you, i'm a little freaked out.

70
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:04,932
I gave nate a week to call,  and he hasn't.

71
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:06,466
Well, if I remembere right

72
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:08,356
You left him alone at a party where he was being honored.

73
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:09,332
Which i feel terrible about.

74
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,108
I just wish he would give me a chance to apologize.

75
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,167
Oh, he will, when he's ready.

76
00:03:16,499 --> 00:03:17,966
Okay.

77
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:20,067
Did you just set me up?

78
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,033
What do you mean? nate just sent me an e-mail.

79
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,332
He wants me to meet him at his place in a half-hour.

80
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:28,700
Really? well, that-- i mean, i was just winging it,

81
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:31,033
But that's good.

82
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,633
Serena!

83
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,266
Hi!

84
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:37,266
Poppy. oh, my gosh. hey. oh, it's so good to see you.

85
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:39,733
I was beginning to think

86
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,833
We weren't running in the same circles anymore.

87
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,973
It's been so long. cute coat. oh,

88
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,733
thanks. you--you look great

89
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,219
I love your hair and your tan.

90
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,733
oh, we just got back from Spain.

91
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,199
"we"? yeah, me and my new boyfriend gabriel.

92
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:52,644
He's so wonderful, serena.

93
00:03:52,645 --> 00:03:54,067
you'd love him. i-i'd love to meet him.

94
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,533
You should.

95
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,199
But we're only in town for 48 hours, though.

96
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:00,133
Gabriel had to come in for business,

97
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,366
But we're gonna fly right back to costa brava

98
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:04,900
On sunday morning. so what about you? what's new?

99
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:07,700
Seeing anybody? uh, yeah. dan and i got back together,

100
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:10,466
But then we broke up again.

101
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:12,033
Oh, i'm sorry.

102
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,167
And your friend-- what's her name? blair?

103
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:16,766
Yeah. how's she doing?

104
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,167
Uh, good now. there was this thing between us,

105
00:04:19,232 --> 00:04:20,842
But then we worked it out, so... wow.

106
00:04:20,842 --> 00:04:23,167
Well, it sounds like everything's exactly the same

107
00:04:23,232 --> 00:04:26,566
As it was last time i saw you.

108
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,440
Makes catching up easier, though, right? yeah.

109
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,966
I-i'm throwing a party this weekend.

110
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:32,100
Really? oh, what's the occasion? not that you need one.

111
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:35,067
Oh, it's--it's for a friend. it's for her sweet 16.

112
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:37,666
Oh. that's... sweet.

113
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:41,466
Yeah. uh, you should come.

114
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:44,167
Yeah. i'll, um, i'll have to check my schedule,

115
00:04:44,232 --> 00:04:46,933
But i'll let you know. yeah. please--please do.

116
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,366
Okay.

117
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:51,033
Well, um, have fun with your little party,

118
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,067
And, um, just take care of yourself, okay?

119
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:03,133
Lily, i can't believe you made us breakfast.

120
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,890
Oh, i just toasted some bagels and

121
00:05:04,891 --> 00:05:06,533
fried some bacon and bugeen

122
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,366
Oh, really, it's no big deal.

123
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,778
Well, if you turned on a burner,

124
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:11,167
lil, it's a big deal.

125
00:05:11,232 --> 00:05:13,033
You are really committed to making this family work.

126
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,133
I'm proud of you, mom. aw. thank you.

127
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,067
Oh, charles, are you staying for breakfast?

128
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:20,933
I have an appointment

129
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:22,000
What does chuck bass do on 8 am?

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,733
It's not like you work out. i do my cardio in the evenings.

131
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,366
Morning is for business, for which i am late.

132
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:28,866
So if you'll excuse me...

133
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:30,299
Does this feel like a sitcom to anybody else?

134
00:05:30,366 --> 00:05:33,466
It feels like a reality show. good. so i can vote you off.

135
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,433
It would almost be scary

136
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:36,800
If it wasn't wearing plaid. um, wait, wait.

137
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:39,167
You guys didn't start without me, did you? hey.

138
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:42,000
You didn't tell her yet. no.

139
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:44,028
What? tell me what? well, we wanted

140
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:45,933
to tell you in person and all of you.

141
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,159
We are planning a sweet 16 party

142
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,211
for you here, tomorrow night.

143
00:05:48,211 --> 00:05:49,733
Fantastic caterer and beautiful flowers.

144
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,966
D.j., the perfect guest list.

145
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:53,966
We wanted it to be a surprise, though.

146
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:56,800
We heard you had one of those last year,

147
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:59,033
And it didn't go so well. oh, jenny cake.

148
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,232
Well, that's why this year, i was more than happy

149
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:03,266
To delegate to people who know better.

150
00:06:03,332 --> 00:06:05,266
So what do you think?

151
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:08,800
Uh... wow. i...

152
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,700
You're not excited?

153
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:15,033
No, i am. i totally am.

154
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,633
But...

155
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,800
Okay, look, last year,

156
00:06:18,866 --> 00:06:21,199
I would have killed for a party like this.

157
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:23,332
But this year, i-i don't know.

158
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:26,533
Things just--things just seem different. like--like, okay,

159
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:29,100
I was just kind of hoping that it would be us

160
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:31,599
And vanessa and jonathan, and then i don't even--

161
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,566
Maybe those two girls from my chem class

162
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:37,766
Who didn't light my hair on fire that one time.

163
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,666
I'm sorry. is that okay? yeah. yeah.

164
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,889
I mean, well, maybe you should just try the cake first.

165
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:44,566
Of course it's okay. it's your birthday.

166
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:48,533
It's whatever you want. yeah, yeah. no, it's not a problem.

167
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:51,133
I'll--i'll just-- i'll cancel. i'm thinking my famous chili.

168
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,033
Maybe some board games.

169
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,100
Yeah. yeah.

170
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:59,100
Um, but really, thank you so much for thinking of me.

171
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:00,733
It means a lot.

172
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,232
Um, i'll just go cancel the caterer.

173
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,000
I should probably get to school.

174
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:27,266
I don't understand why she wouldn't want it.

175
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:28,660
Every culture in the world has

176
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:30,966
some version of a sweet 16 party.

177
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,199
It's like a universal rite of passage.

178
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:35,167
Well, since she got back to constance,

179
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,199
Jenny hasn't exactly made a lot of friends.

180
00:07:37,266 --> 00:07:40,199
You know, downsizing the party might have something to do

181
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:42,700
With the fear that no one will show up.

182
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:43,766
Serena.

183
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,629
Word is out that your party went

184
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,966
from 60 to zero in the last hour..

185
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:51,767
We knew you'd accept defeat gracefully.

186
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,867
What are you talking about?

187
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,233
You canceled jenny's party to move off penelope's date.

188
00:07:56,299 --> 00:07:58,333
Penelope's having a party tomorrow night?

189
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,767
Since when?

190
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,700
Since always. we were all going, but at least now

191
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:05,400
We don't have to pretend to feel bad about missing yours.

192
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:06,983
- Hey, p. - hey, girls. how excited are

193
00:08:06,984 --> 00:08:08,500
you about the part don't cancel...

194
00:08:11,466 --> 00:08:15,199
Spotted--s. learning the answer to the age-old question,

195
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:18,299
"what if you were throwing a party and no one cared?"

196
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:21,266
When that happens, don't cancel...

197
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,500
Poppy, hey. it's serena.

198
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:25,466
You know that party i was telling you about?

199
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:28,433
I was hoping we could meet up. I need your help.

200
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,833
Make them eat cake.

201
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:56,833
I see you got the e-mail i sent from Nate's account.

202
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:59,999
His password has been "soccer" since the fifth grade.

203
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:03,800
Look, Blair leaves his place at this time every morning.

204
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:05,932
When you're ready to do something about it,

205
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:08,233
You know where i am.

206
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:12,299
And when you're not from the upper east side,

207
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:14,299
Sometims a morning is just beginning to a very bad day.

208
00:09:18,888 --> 00:09:21,999
I'm all foyou and nate

209
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Isn't that a bit "been there, done that, got dumped twice"?

210
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,467
Nate and I are purely platonic.

211
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,401
I've seen you leave his place in the morning.

212
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:32,801
Oh, of course you're stalking me.

213
00:09:32,868 --> 00:09:35,334
You know, if you were any good at it,

214
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:37,900
You would know i bring him breakfast.

215
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:39,622
We're just friends. we haven't

216
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:41,334
shared so much kiss even

217
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:42,801
Friends?

218
00:09:42,868 --> 00:09:45,234
That makes total sense.

219
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,567
There's no spark between you two, never was.

220
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:50,567
You're like a green twig and a soggy match,

221
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:53,601
A rusty hammer and an icy nail.

222
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:57,234
Nate and I have... had plenty of spark.

223
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,834
-Better than that--fireworks.  - That was us.

224
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:05,033
Chuck...

225
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,834
Don't act like i didn't fight for you.

226
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,933
I did--hard, and for a long time.

227
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,067
So please,

228
00:10:14,134 --> 00:10:17,134
Forgive me if now that we're over, i'm exhausted.

229
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,634
So what, you're with nate because it's easy?

230
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:21,734
I'm not with nate.

231
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:25,933
But if i was, what's wrong with easy?

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,900
Maybe it's easy because it's right.

233
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,601
Oh, really? is that why nate is so reluctant

234
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:33,601
To break things off with vanessa?

235
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,567
You do know they're still dating, right?

236
00:10:41,868 --> 00:10:43,534
Try this.

237
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:48,501
Wonderful.

238
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:50,967
hey, is the, uh, yale packet around, dad?

239
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:52,933
I just--i wanted to look at the dorms.

240
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,768
Oh, jeez. i-i think i left it at lil's. sorry.

241
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:58,534
Oh, okay. that's all right. I'll just get it tomorrow.

242
00:10:58,601 --> 00:11:01,467
But, uh, let me know if you two need help. hmm.

243
00:11:01,534 --> 00:11:04,768
Why did you just lie to him? the packet's right there.

244
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:08,000
Dan was denied... financial aid at yale.

245
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,601
Funds are limited,

246
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:12,667
And these days, there are a lot of other students

247
00:11:12,734 --> 00:11:14,328
That need it more than we do.

248
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:16,033
I'm sorry. do you save,

249
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,134
Of course, but i-i planned

250
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,967
On at least part of his tuition being subsidized.

251
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:24,667
Well, um, i mean, i could help you out.

252
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:28,501
Thank you, but no. as kind as it is for you to offer,

253
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:30,401
I think i need to handle this on my own.

254
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:32,501
I just wish i had an idea.

255
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,501
Well, you could sell the loft, and then you'd have, um,

256
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:37,601
Enough for dan's tuition and then some.

257
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:39,634
And this is where dan and jenny grew up.

258
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:42,334
Besides, where would we live? on the streets?

259
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:45,434
Well... you could move in with me.

260
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,134
That's a big step, lil.

261
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,768
I know. but i always saw it as the next one for us anyway.

262
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:56,667
Are we ready for that?

263
00:11:56,734 --> 00:11:59,067
Well, there's one way to find out.

264
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:02,601
Look, why don't you just talk to an agent

265
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:05,033
And see what they say?

266
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:10,000
You know what i was just thinking?

267
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:12,801
Jennifer aniston is totally fine now.

268
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:16,634
I'm sure brad doesn't even feel bad anymore. okay.

269
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:19,634
I mean, i'm sure that there was some collateral damage,

270
00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:22,534
Which is always sad, but his fate lay with angelina,

271
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:24,100
And he knew that,

272
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:27,868
So he had the tough conversation and moved on.

273
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:30,900
This is your way of saying i should break up with vanessa?

274
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:32,868
So me and you can... embrace our fate.

275
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:34,234
Ah. yes.

276
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,701
Okay. well, i wasn't actually gonna tell you this

277
00:12:36,768 --> 00:12:39,200
Till afterwards, but vanessa called a couple hours ago,

278
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:41,300
And she just wants to talk,

279
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:43,768
So i asked her to meet me for dinner.

280
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:47,033
But can't you just text?

281
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,401
No.

282
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,367
But what if when you see her,

283
00:12:50,434 --> 00:12:53,434
There's sparks or fireworks, even?

284
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:55,640
You know, they say breakup sex is-- hey, hey, hey, hey.

285
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,868
Vanessa and i--it feels over,

286
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:59,100
And i'm sure she's gonna tell me the same thing.

287
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:02,000
Listen, i promise i'll come straight over after it's done.

288
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
On their first trip to africa,

289
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:08,033
Brad and angelina's lovemaking was so intense,

290
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,067
The guards thought they were being attacked.

291
00:13:10,134 --> 00:13:12,868
Well, how about i just start by talking to vanessa

292
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:15,267
And see where all this goes? sound good?

293
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:17,501
Sounds great.

294
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,167
Okay.

295
00:13:29,234 --> 00:13:31,933
Oh, you must be jenny. it's so nice to meet you. oh.

296
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,667
- I'm poppy. - hi.

297
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:35,734
Serena, i wasn't expecting any of this.

298
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:38,701
Oh, well, my mom wanted you to have your dream dress.

299
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:40,734
We thought missoni would be right,

300
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:43,067
So i brought a friend to help with the selection.

301
00:13:43,134 --> 00:13:46,000
So what about that one?

302
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:49,033
Well, i wish i was the kind of girl

303
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,267
Who was having the kind of party

304
00:13:51,334 --> 00:13:53,534
Where i could wear this kind of dress.

305
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:55,134
I'm not, so...

306
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,933
I-i think--i guess i'll just-- i'll just try this one.

307
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:05,567
Hey. thanks for meeting me.

308
00:14:05,634 --> 00:14:09,567
After i saw you this morning, i felt kind of terrible.

309
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm--i'm in a rut, aren't i?

310
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,067
Yeah. well, a girl like you

311
00:14:14,134 --> 00:14:16,000
Should be on the arm of a designer

312
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,134
At the costume ball one day

313
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,567
And yachting around the maldives the next,

314
00:14:20,634 --> 00:14:23,567
Not making up and breaking up with the same high school boy

315
00:14:23,634 --> 00:14:25,300
And feuding with your frenemy.

316
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:26,834
I know.

317
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,300
What--what can i do?

318
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:32,267
Well, this party would be a good place to start.

319
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:34,367
Yeah, i-i-i thought that,

320
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:37,734
But jenny is just really set on something more simple.

321
00:14:37,801 --> 00:14:39,834
Any 16-year-old girl would love

322
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,601
The kind of party that you should be throwing--

323
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:45,868
Adult, elegant, the right notables in attendance.

324
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:48,834
And you saw the way that she looked at that dress.

325
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,900
She loves it. she wants a party like this.

326
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:53,868
She just needs someone to hold her hand a little.

327
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,167
So... what do you think?

328
00:14:59,234 --> 00:15:02,200
We like that one better.

329
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:07,067
Okay. i guess-- i guess i'll just try it on.

330
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:12,701
See? she loves it. that's all the proof you need.

331
00:15:12,768 --> 00:15:14,768
You know, it's not too late.

332
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:17,367
Why don't you start making some phone calls?

333
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:28,567
Hi. it's serena van der woodsen.

334
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:31,467
Um, i know my mom might have called you this morning,

335
00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:33,567
But there's been a mistake.

336
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:36,167
The party's not canceled. it's--it's still on,

337
00:15:36,234 --> 00:15:38,033
And actually, it's--it's gonna be bigger.

338
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,994
Hi.

339
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:47,994
Hi.

340
00:15:48,061 --> 00:15:52,360
Thanks for meeting me. it's really good to see you.

341
00:15:52,427 --> 00:15:55,061
I have a feeling you're not gonna like what i have to say.

342
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:57,128
Hey, don't act surprised, v.

343
00:15:57,194 --> 00:16:01,293
You saw this coming. i mean, you left first.

344
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,994
I know, but...

345
00:16:04,061 --> 00:16:06,827
I mean, i'm sure we can do something

346
00:16:06,894 --> 00:16:08,794
To figure it all out, if we tried.

347
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,794
Okay.

348
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:16,560
Well, at least we can end things honestly, right?

349
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:18,160
- Right. - because if there is someone else,

350
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,694
You could tell me.

351
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:21,794
Probably make things easier.

352
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:25,228
This is about you and me. no one else.

353
00:16:25,293 --> 00:16:28,560
- Really? - yeah, really.

354
00:16:31,194 --> 00:16:34,194
It's 10:30, dorota. what took him so long?

355
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,761
Maybe girl from Brokenly cry.Mr Nate nicely boy.

356
00:16:36,827 --> 00:16:38,410
He wipe tears. he touch her hair.

357
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,994
She touch his.

358
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:42,344
Dorota.

359
00:16:42,344 --> 00:16:44,627
Not that it's ever happen to me.

360
00:16:44,694 --> 00:16:46,228
It's done.

361
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:49,360
Whoa. don't look too happy.

362
00:16:49,427 --> 00:16:51,194
Oh, right. sorry.

363
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,827
Was it awful?

364
00:16:52,894 --> 00:16:55,961
No. things had come to a natural end, so...

365
00:16:56,027 --> 00:16:58,861
And it had nothing to do with anyone else.

366
00:16:58,927 --> 00:17:01,494
Of course. it was just about you guys.

367
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,027
Hey, listen. it's, um, it's getting late,

368
00:17:05,094 --> 00:17:07,228
And i've had a really tough day.

369
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:10,194
So how about tomorrow, okay?

370
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,061
We could hang out this weekend.

371
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,627
Pour that dom down the drain, dorota.

372
00:17:25,694 --> 00:17:27,994
Wait. is that the '96?

373
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:30,360
What happened, miss blair?

374
00:17:30,427 --> 00:17:32,327
He kissed me on the forehead,

375
00:17:32,393 --> 00:17:34,393
Like chevalier kissed gigi...

376
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,360
Like he was a man, and i was a little girl.

377
00:17:38,427 --> 00:17:40,961
No passion, no spark.

378
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,194
Maybe chuck was right.

379
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,761
Maybe all nate and i have together is just...

380
00:17:46,827 --> 00:17:49,228
History.

381
00:17:49,293 --> 00:17:52,727
Poor b. it's hard to turn up the heat with an old flame.

382
00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:55,094
But stand back.

383
00:17:55,094 --> 00:17:57,427
Someone's about to add fuel to this fire.

384
00:17:57,494 --> 00:18:00,594
I have to say, i was a little surprised when you called.

385
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,177
That he dumped me, i can accept,

386
00:18:02,177 --> 00:18:03,694
But then he had the nerve

387
00:18:03,761 --> 00:18:06,427
To say that there was nothing between him and blair.

388
00:18:06,494 --> 00:18:09,827
The "just friends" speech? i got it, too.

389
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:12,094
They're making fools of us.

390
00:18:12,161 --> 00:18:13,794
Well, not anymore.

391
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,927
Wow. you got a lot of board games there.

392
00:18:26,993 --> 00:18:29,227
Uh, you know, we're going to a birthday party.

393
00:18:29,294 --> 00:18:30,794
It's not a bomb shelter.

394
00:18:30,794 --> 00:18:32,294
Yeah, well, i want to have options.

395
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,244
- Uh, do you know if vanessa's coming? - yeah.

396
00:18:34,244 --> 00:18:36,127
Yeah, she and nate broke up last night.

397
00:18:36,193 --> 00:18:38,927
It seems like she's taking it pretty hard,

398
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,643
But, uh, she wants to come to the party,

399
00:18:40,643 --> 00:18:42,294
- Said she'd call.  - Okay

400
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,193
Oh, and that's probably her.

401
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,643
Hello?

402
00:18:46,643 --> 00:18:48,027
Mr. humphrey? it's gail from brooklyn realty.

403
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,160
I wanted to schedule a time

404
00:18:50,227 --> 00:18:52,193
For our appraiser to come out to your loft.

405
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,260
Is this a bad time?

406
00:18:54,327 --> 00:18:58,826
Uh, yeah. you know, i'll call you later.

407
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,526
Not vanessa?

408
00:19:00,593 --> 00:19:03,459
No. you know, we should probably start getting ready.

409
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:05,127
Okay.

410
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:10,693
Wait. back up, blair. nate and vanessa broke up?

411
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:13,659
Oh, they had a falling-out after the van der bilt party,

412
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:15,893
Hadn't spoken for a week and broke up last night.

413
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:17,526
How do you know all this?

414
00:19:17,526 --> 00:19:19,093
Have you dumped me for vanessa?

415
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,893
No. i've just been spending a lot of time with nate.

416
00:19:22,893 --> 00:19:25,259
Oh. where is this coming from?

417
00:19:25,326 --> 00:19:27,226
- What? - you and nate?

418
00:19:27,226 --> 00:19:29,127
After all that you've been through?

419
00:19:29,194 --> 00:19:32,060
You sure it's not just because nate's not chuck?

420
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:34,160
I thought chuck was my future,

421
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Nate a part of my past.

422
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,793
But now i'm thinking

423
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,760
Chuck was just something i had to get out of my system

424
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:43,727
In order to realize nate was my destiny all along.

425
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:45,660
Well, if that's really how you feel,

426
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,760
Then i'm happy for you.

427
00:19:47,827 --> 00:19:49,727
It's not exactly like i was rooting for chuck,

428
00:19:49,793 --> 00:19:51,760
And nate is good for you. no drama.

429
00:19:51,827 --> 00:19:57,927
Nate and i have plenty of drama and sparks and fireworks.

430
00:19:57,993 --> 00:20:00,027
Uh-huh. when are you getting to my party?

431
00:20:00,094 --> 00:20:01,793
You mean jenny's party.

432
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:06,426
So do you have any idea what's going on out there?

433
00:20:06,493 --> 00:20:08,927
B., i gotta go. i'm sorry.

434
00:20:08,993 --> 00:20:11,626
Jenny's gonna love it.

435
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:18,226
Hey, vanya.

436
00:20:19,793 --> 00:20:22,827
"Guilty liberal 'victims' and their assault on america"

437
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:24,460
By ann coulter?

438
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:27,460
Dorota gave to me. she said important to know enemy.

439
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,793
It's okay. i read to make dorota happy.

440
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,860
I have to say, i'm excited.

441
00:20:33,927 --> 00:20:35,460
Oh, you should be.

442
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,526
Dad only makes his chili on very special occasions.

443
00:20:37,593 --> 00:20:39,526
Well, not just about my birthday.

444
00:20:39,593 --> 00:20:42,359
I mean, of course about my birthday, but, you know,

445
00:20:42,426 --> 00:20:44,493
Lily and dad and all of us together?

446
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,827
I don't know. things just seem to be going really good.

447
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:49,793
Yeah. a little too good.

448
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,760
What? since when is "good" too good?

449
00:20:55,293 --> 00:20:56,860
Dan?

450
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,793
Uh, y-you know that phone call that wasn't vanessa?

451
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,194
It was a real estate agent.

452
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:06,526
I think dad might be selling the loft.

453
00:21:06,593 --> 00:21:09,960
What? no. where would we live?

454
00:21:10,027 --> 00:21:11,560
Well, i'd be at college.

455
00:21:11,626 --> 00:21:14,127
I guess you and dad would be...

456
00:21:14,194 --> 00:21:16,960
Moving on up to the east side,

457
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:19,359
To a deluxe apartment in the sky-y-y.

458
00:21:19,426 --> 00:21:21,393
Okay, yeah, yeah, funny. first of all,

459
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,526
You need to stop watching so many old sitcoms on hulu,

460
00:21:24,593 --> 00:21:27,793
And second, dad on the upper east side?

461
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,894
I mean, there's no way. no, we can't

462
00:21:29,895 --> 00:21:31,760
live up here. we're

463
00:21:31,827 --> 00:21:33,960
- Humphy's.  - Damn straight

464
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:37,960
We grew up good. you know that?

465
00:21:38,027 --> 00:21:40,827
Yeah.

466
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,027
Okay. it looks familiar

467
00:21:55,094 --> 00:21:56,593
And yet...

468
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,760
Not bad, little j.

469
00:21:58,827 --> 00:21:59,785
What are you doing here?

470
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,160
Once i heard poppy lifton was coming to your party,

471
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,227
I canceled mine. in the last 20 minutes,

472
00:22:03,294 --> 00:22:06,526
I've been hit on by two bronfmans and a gay designer.

473
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:08,426
It was so worth it.

474
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:10,260
Kudos on rising from the social grave.

475
00:22:10,326 --> 00:22:13,993
Speaking of graves, did something die in that pot?

476
00:22:16,093 --> 00:22:17,860
It's cumin.

477
00:22:19,827 --> 00:22:21,860
I liked my social grave.

478
00:22:21,927 --> 00:22:25,060
I dug it myself, and i was happy to lie in it.

479
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:25,976
What's going on? why are they here?

480
00:22:25,976 --> 00:22:27,260
I don't know.

481
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,260
This chili weighs a ton, though.

482
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,593
I need to find a caterer.

483
00:22:37,793 --> 00:22:39,693
Jenny, hey. i didn't see you come in.

484
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,660
How could you with all this fabulous going on? well done.

485
00:22:42,726 --> 00:22:44,726
Happy birthday, jenny.

486
00:22:44,793 --> 00:22:46,860
Poppy, i didn't expect to see you.

487
00:22:46,927 --> 00:22:50,893
- Hey, uh, will you get us some drinks? - sure.

488
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,793
Well, surprised?

489
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,927
Confused. i mean, what is all this?

490
00:22:54,993 --> 00:22:56,468
Where's my dad and lily?

491
00:22:56,469 --> 00:22:57,860
they're at "billy elliot," fifth road center

492
00:22:57,927 --> 00:23:00,359
I-i told them that a girl only turns 16 once,

493
00:23:00,426 --> 00:23:02,426
And she needs to spend it with her friends

494
00:23:02,493 --> 00:23:04,020
And friends of friends. my present to you.

495
00:23:04,021 --> 00:23:05,593
serena, i didn't want this.

496
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,060
Well, i thought you didn't want a social fiasco

497
00:23:08,127 --> 00:23:09,593
Where--where you planned something

498
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,927
And people didn't show up, but this is perfect.

499
00:23:12,993 --> 00:23:16,459
I mean, jenny, all of these people are here for you.

500
00:23:16,526 --> 00:23:18,726
Patrick, hey. uh, would you take a picture

501
00:23:18,793 --> 00:23:21,060
- With me and the birthday girl? - sure.

502
00:23:21,127 --> 00:23:23,526
It's a birthday?

503
00:23:23,593 --> 00:23:26,426
Excuse me.

504
00:23:26,493 --> 00:23:28,243
Enjoying my party?

505
00:23:28,243 --> 00:23:29,993
You know, i was just saying to jonathan

506
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,960
That this is a lovely, intimate family gathering.

507
00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:33,660
Nothing says "jenny humphrey"

508
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:36,060
Like a customized cocktail napkin. mm.

509
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:38,793
Eric, i don't get it.

510
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,960
Why would serena hijack my birthday?

511
00:23:41,027 --> 00:23:43,827
Well, i know she was trying to do something nice for you.

512
00:23:43,893 --> 00:23:45,927
Maybe she just got a little carried away.

513
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:48,560
And maybe she wanted to prove to everyone

514
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,727
She could still throw a great party.

515
00:23:50,794 --> 00:23:52,999
Well... if she wants people to know

516
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,583
What a great party she can throw,

517
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,166
Why not tell everyone?

518
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:08,066
I came to you because i wanted to do something

519
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:11,333
Besides feel sorry for myself, but all it's been is

520
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,767
Sleazy platitudes and...

521
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,433
You staring at my boobs.

522
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,433
I came up with several excellent ideas.

523
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,034
You just shot most of them down.

524
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:22,034
Yeah, because they all involved

525
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:24,667
Leaking a chuck/vanessa sex tape to the internet.

526
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:28,366
We don't have to leak the tape if you don't want to.

527
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:31,567
Consistent, if twisted.

528
00:24:45,034 --> 00:24:46,366
Why are they here?

529
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:52,099
What do we do?

530
00:24:58,633 --> 00:25:03,400
Spotted--two people who should know better

531
00:25:03,466 --> 00:25:07,266
And two people who don't know what hit them.

532
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:15,667
No, of course there's no keg!

533
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:20,567
Serena, who are these rowdy children?

534
00:25:20,633 --> 00:25:23,500
I mean, i know jenny's young, but this is embarrassing.

535
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:25,500
I know. i know. i'm so sorry.

536
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:28,934
Um, just give me a minute, and--and i'll figure this out.

537
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,298
We're leaving. you should come with.

538
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:32,300
Trust me, i would love to get out of here right now,

539
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:35,833
But i think i should deal with the table dancers first.

540
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,400
I'll--i'll catch up with you later.

541
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:38,900
well, do try, for your own good

542
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:41,567
Yeah.

543
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:52,108
Jenny. jenny, please help me get

544
00:25:52,109 --> 00:25:53,633
rid of these pf

545
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,034
Um, they're not crashing, serena. i invited them.

546
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:58,867
Well, you have your guest list, and i have mine.

547
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:02,300
Yeah, but--but this can't be what you want.

548
00:26:02,366 --> 00:26:03,396
Like you care what i want.

549
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:04,736
Jenny, i genuinely thought that

550
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:06,034
when you got of

551
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:08,733
You would be thrilled, and if you weren't,

552
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,188
Then i'm sorry, but you should have just said something.

553
00:26:10,188 --> 00:26:11,400
Serena, i did, at breakfast, and you clearly--

554
00:26:11,466 --> 00:26:13,299
-Serena  -um... it's fine. jenny and

555
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,133
are just having our first fight.

556
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:18,133
-There are strangers having sex in your bed.  -oh, my god.

557
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:23,133
Wait. did you get that out of my mother's closet?

558
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:25,233
The word he used was, uh, uh, "haunting,"

559
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,366
"a haunting sense of immediacy."

560
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:30,400
I love that. oh. yeah, he's-- he's a smart guy, my fan.

561
00:26:30,466 --> 00:26:33,433
He's a good writer. he's a good writer. dan, help.

562
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,288
Well, i'm kind of in the middle of something.

563
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:36,833
Well, i need you to be in the middle

564
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,433
Of something else.

565
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,433
Where'd your boyfriend go?

566
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,266
We're not a couple.

567
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,133
It's just physical.

568
00:26:46,199 --> 00:26:49,199
I'll take your word for it.

569
00:26:49,266 --> 00:26:52,333
But listen, whatever's going on between you two,

570
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,900
Just make sure chuck

571
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:56,066
Doesn't talk you into doing something you regret.

572
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:59,099
Whatever's going on with chuck wasn't his idea. it was mine,

573
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:01,199
And least he doesn't pretend to be one thing,

574
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:03,533
When really he's another.

575
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,066
-You said there was no one else.  -there's not.

576
00:27:06,133 --> 00:27:08,833
Blair's my friend. nothing's happened between us.

577
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,199
Well, not yet.

578
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:14,066
But he's telling you the truth.

579
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,633
Nate's a good guy.

580
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,900
If you'd have seen that, maybe you'd still be together.

581
00:27:18,967 --> 00:27:22,000
Now that he's free, who knows what will happen?

582
00:27:22,066 --> 00:27:23,869
Exactly. we don't know. we're just hanging out.

583
00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:25,867
Sure, that's what people do at parties, hang out.

584
00:27:25,934 --> 00:27:29,000
But later, when we're alone-- blair...

585
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:32,333
-We'll talk about it.  -what is there to talk about?

586
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,266
Okay, do you guys want to have this conversation

587
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:38,500
-Somewhere else, alone?  why are you still standing here?

588
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,133
Blair, what are we doing in here?

589
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:45,133
You're not leaving this room until we find out

590
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:48,934
Once and for all if we're really just friends.

591
00:27:53,034 --> 00:27:55,600
Well, don't just stare at me. do something.

592
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:59,000
Blair, stop acting like me being your friend

593
00:27:59,066 --> 00:28:01,333
Is some kind of plot to humiliate you, okay?

594
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,366
Did you ever think that maybe

595
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:05,400
Things didn't work out between us

596
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:07,233
Because we weren't friends?

597
00:28:10,233 --> 00:28:12,199
You're right, nate.

598
00:28:12,266 --> 00:28:16,099
This week, you've become my friend.

599
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:18,934
It's amazing,

600
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,400
And i've never wanted to kiss my friend so much in my life.

601
00:28:24,066 --> 00:28:26,034
We're at a party full of people in chuck's room,

602
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:28,567
And he and vanessa are right behind the wall.

603
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:30,967
That doesn't excite you?

604
00:28:31,034 --> 00:28:33,800
Blair...

605
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:41,466
Don't.

606
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:48,333
Only my boyfriend gets to touch my hair.

607
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:53,600
They have been in there for a while.

608
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:55,311
What if all we did is push 'em closer together?

609
00:28:55,312 --> 00:28:56,733
You just need to relax

610
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,700
And trust in the power of our overwhelming sexual chemistry

611
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:02,700
To drive a wedge between them.

612
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:08,867
Go intercept him.

613
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:21,333
It looks like that went well.

614
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,333
You wanted to be more like blair waldorf?

615
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Well, congratulations. you succeeded.

616
00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:28,833
Poor v. nobody gets what they want

617
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,967
Without losing something they love,

618
00:29:31,034 --> 00:29:33,233
Like their integrity.

619
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,500
-Stains.  -ooh. ew! gross!

620
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:41,733
I can't believe jenny would turn

621
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,733
A sophisticated soiree into a teenage rager.

622
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,200
Well, you did turn her sprabble and sloppy joe party

623
00:29:47,266 --> 00:29:49,999
Into a sophisticated soiree, so... you know,

624
00:29:50,066 --> 00:29:52,867
Not that the punishment exactly fits the crime.

625
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:55,433
Well, maybe on some entirely subconscious level,

626
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,500
I was thinking of myself.

627
00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:02,999
Well, yes, it--it may have been somewhat conscious,

628
00:30:03,066 --> 00:30:04,567
But i don't know.

629
00:30:04,633 --> 00:30:07,667
My--my life has just felt so normal lately.

630
00:30:07,733 --> 00:30:10,500
Getting back together with you and breaking up again,

631
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:12,867
Fighting with blair and then not--

632
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:14,527
It just--it all felt so high school.

633
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,767
well, we are iihat's going o

634
00:30:15,834 --> 00:30:17,733
At least for a little while longer.

635
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,625
Old people seem oddly nostalgic

636
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:21,333
for this time ihat's going on

637
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,333
Is it gonna make me sound like my dad

638
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,667
If i say that you have the rest of your life

639
00:30:25,733 --> 00:30:27,700
To throw these fabulous society parties,

640
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:29,867
But this might be the last opportunity you have

641
00:30:29,934 --> 00:30:32,600
To roust naked strangers from making love on your mattress?

642
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:35,433
Actually, you know, it sounds a lot like college.

643
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,099
Serena, we have a problem.

644
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:41,733
How was i supposed to know that if i threw you

645
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,510
The best party of the year, you would sabotage it?

646
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,500
How was i supposed to know how many kids would show up?

647
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:47,733
Parasites! hooligans! get!

648
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,500
Vanya. vanya, what's going on?

649
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:53,333
Worse than the rats, with their cell phones over and over.

650
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,567
It's too much. go home!

651
00:30:55,633 --> 00:30:57,600
Away, before i--

652
00:30:57,667 --> 00:31:01,433
Call the cops. -politzia.

653
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,700
Well, at least they scared everyone away.

654
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:15,966
Hi, kids.

655
00:31:16,033 --> 00:31:17,366
We're home.

656
00:31:22,133 --> 00:31:24,900
-Oh, my god. oh, my god.  -okay, lil, deep breath.

657
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,867
Oh! things definitely got out of hand,

658
00:31:26,934 --> 00:31:29,900
But the most important thing is that the kids are okay.

659
00:31:29,966 --> 00:31:32,333
Yes, well, that may be the most important thing,

660
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,834
But the second most important thing is the apartment--

661
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,533
The furniture, the--the rugs, the art, the--my closet.

662
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,300
I thought i recognized that dress.

663
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:43,667
Serena, how did this happen?

664
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:45,767
Mom, i admit i made a few phone calls.

665
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:48,966
If you want to punish someone for the passed hors d'oeuvres,

666
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:52,934
Point the finger here. guilty as charged.

667
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:55,433
But as far as all the people...

668
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,467
Oh, and you expect me to believe that jenny was behind this?

669
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:02,233
After she had me cancel the best caterer in town

670
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,400
Because she wanted clue and a crock-pot.

671
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:06,999
Mom, you could--

672
00:32:07,066 --> 00:32:09,467
Could at least make an attempt to mask your distaste.

673
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:17,300
Don't you dare leave me here to clean up this mess, serena.

674
00:32:17,366 --> 00:32:19,333
When this family was just me and eric,

675
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,400
If things got out of control,

676
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:24,200
It was a pretty safe bet that it was my fault. that's true.

677
00:32:24,266 --> 00:32:27,233
But as this family grows, so does the pool of suspects.

678
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,533
This is not my mess.

679
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:35,133
Okay, so whose mess is it?

680
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,166
I mean, all i did was carry the chili

681
00:32:37,233 --> 00:32:39,767
And prevent teenagers from having unprotected sex.

682
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:41,300
Serena may have had her own motives

683
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,767
I may have helped

684
00:32:42,834 --> 00:32:45,733
With the crowd situation with a few inspirational words,

685
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,200
But, um...

686
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:51,934
But i was the one who posted the party on "gossip girl."

687
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:54,233
Look, i'm sorry, lily,

688
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,834
And i'm sorry, dad.

689
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,834
And i don't know. maybe serena was just trying to be nice,

690
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,133
But the party that she threw was totally embarrassing.

691
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,733
Jenny, i don't understand.

692
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,767
Um, it sounds to me like what serena put together

693
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:09,500
Was... delightful.

694
00:33:11,433 --> 00:33:14,834
You know, at least last year, it was my face on the cake.

695
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,999
And the people at my party might have hated me,

696
00:33:18,066 --> 00:33:20,033
But at least they knew who i was.

697
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:23,733
I know that it's hard for you guys to understand,

698
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,567
But i like being me, and as crazy as it may seem,

699
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:29,600
I choose not to be a park avenue princess

700
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:32,800
On my birthday or any other day,

701
00:33:32,867 --> 00:33:35,400
No matter what my address might be.

702
00:33:35,467 --> 00:33:37,966
What are you talking about, jenny?

703
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:43,400
The real estate agent called today.

704
00:33:43,467 --> 00:33:46,900
Dad, you and lily might want to live together,

705
00:33:46,966 --> 00:33:49,834
But i'm just not ready to stop being a humphrey.

706
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,500
Wait. live together?

707
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,500
Teenage ragers,

708
00:33:59,567 --> 00:34:02,333
Annoying sort of siblings, being yelled at by my mother--

709
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,066
This should not be my life.

710
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:05,733
It doesn't have to be, sweetie.

711
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,767
I mean, so what if your stock took a dip in last quarter...

712
00:34:08,834 --> 00:34:10,934
Whose didn't? but that doesn't mean

713
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:12,431
You can't still turn things around.

714
00:34:12,432 --> 00:34:13,700
well, then what are your suggestion...

715
00:34:13,767 --> 00:34:15,733
And don't say to host another party.

716
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,266
No.

717
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:19,633
Uh, well, it sounds to me like you need to get away.

718
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,099
Yes. yes! road trip.

719
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:26,300
No. i was thinking more like a private jet to spain.

720
00:34:26,366 --> 00:34:29,333
Yeah. mm, see, even my fantasies are becoming dull.

721
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,433
Listen, gabriel's parents' place is insanely beautiful,

722
00:34:32,433 --> 00:34:35,467
And the weather and the food

723
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:37,900
And gabriel's hot friends...

724
00:34:37,966 --> 00:34:40,133
- Mm. when do we leave? - tomorrow morning.

725
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,999
Tomorrow?

726
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:46,400
I... i'm embarrassed to say this,

727
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:49,266
But i-i think i might be grounded.

728
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:51,166
Serena...

729
00:34:51,233 --> 00:34:52,667
No.

730
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:54,066
I know.

731
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,633
Yeah, i mean, you're right.

732
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,966
Yeah, let's go to spain.

733
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:01,233
- To espa! - to espa!

734
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:05,200
Uh-oh, looks like someone's up to their old tricks,

735
00:35:05,266 --> 00:35:06,834
And just in time, too.

736
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,300
Cuidado, espa. here comes el problema.

737
00:35:13,133 --> 00:35:16,033
Ugh. i can't tell if it's chili in my pot

738
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:17,433
Or if some kid threw up in here.

739
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,965
And wait it out while an army

740
00:35:19,966 --> 00:35:22,532
of highly traine circumstance restores our home.

741
00:35:22,532 --> 00:35:25,099
did you ever hear from serena?

742
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:27,767
Yeah, she left a message saying she was sleeping at poppy's.

743
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,767
Oh, i shouldn't have jumped to conclusions,

744
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:31,314
Been so hard on her.

745
00:35:31,314 --> 00:35:32,795
And jenny should have spoken up sooner.

746
00:35:32,795 --> 00:35:33,999
Lil, i'm really sorry.

747
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:35,934
And so is she. i know.

748
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:37,519
I just think we might be moving a bit fast.

749
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,000
I don't think we should move in together.

750
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:48,000
I love the idea of our family sharing a place together.

751
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,333
One day.

752
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,433
It's gonna be complicated to say to list

753
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,600
We need to find our way and the kids need to find theirs.

754
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:55,433
We shouldn't let circumstance

755
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,333
Impose a time line.

756
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,099
I agree. but what are you gonna do about dan and yale?

757
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:03,333
We'll figure something out.

758
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
Figure out what?

759
00:36:06,467 --> 00:36:09,000
What do we need to figure out between me and yale?

760
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,433
I'm gonna go get dressed.

761
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:21,233
Wait. is that--is that why you were moving in with lily?

762
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,200
To pay for my education?

763
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:27,366
Uh... what--at happened?

764
00:36:27,433 --> 00:36:29,733
Yale has great financial aid.

765
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,767
Well, as of now, we're a low priority.

766
00:36:31,834 --> 00:36:33,223
It's all determined by need. and

767
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:36,533
It's all relative, dan. well, what do we do?

768
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:39,533
Well,I'm never let money getting a way

769
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,867
Of your education before. i'm not gonna start now.

770
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:43,467
We've got some time.

771
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:45,767
And you need to stay positive about your future.

772
00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:48,099
Did you call that kid who sent you a fan letter?

773
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,930
I bet he's dying to hear back from you.

774
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,834
Yeah, well, i mean, it was great of him

775
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,900
To reach out like that, so i'll give him a call.

776
00:36:54,966 --> 00:36:57,567
Dan.

777
00:36:57,633 --> 00:37:00,099
We'll figure out a way.

778
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:01,600
Oh, i-i know.

779
00:37:06,233 --> 00:37:09,300
I should have known it was too good to last.

780
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,700
It's just-- i was having so much fun

781
00:37:12,767 --> 00:37:14,733
Hanging out with a normal guy like nate.

782
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,800
We may not have had the drama or the electricity,

783
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:20,867
But you know what we did have? fun?

784
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:23,333
Yes, dorota, fun.

785
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,767
Nate--he's so nice.

786
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:28,966
Being around him wasn't hard.

787
00:37:29,033 --> 00:37:32,500
It didn't hurt... until now.

788
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:35,800
I miss my friend nate.

789
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:37,834
Maybe you get happy soon.

790
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,066
True.

791
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:41,099
The ducks do soothe me.

792
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:43,133
Give me my loaf.

793
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,966
Mr. nate called to ask where your favorite spot--

794
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:53,900
That be where he want first kiss.

795
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:03,400
Is it true that you brought me here?

796
00:38:03,467 --> 00:38:05,934
Well, you ran off too quickly last night,

797
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:08,233
All i want to tell you

798
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,400
Is that i do want to be with you...

799
00:38:11,467 --> 00:38:13,033
Just not like that.

800
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:47,533
Excuse me. do i know you?

801
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,805
Uh, i don't think so, no. i met you

802
00:38:49,806 --> 00:38:52,200
last year, around this time actually

803
00:38:52,266 --> 00:38:54,333
You were with a friend of yours,

804
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,200
And you were calling yourself savannah.

805
00:38:56,266 --> 00:38:59,233
Hi. sorry i'm late. mmm.

806
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,400
I got some freshments for the ride. hey! hey! yeah.

807
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:04,900
Did you two introduce yourselves? uh, not exactly.

808
00:39:04,966 --> 00:39:06,500
It's serena.

809
00:39:06,567 --> 00:39:10,200
I figured. well, it's nice to meet you again. i'm gabriel.

810
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:12,700
Oh, my god. we're gonna have so much fun.

811
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,633
Hold this. i gotta get my coat.

812
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:22,366
Scott!

813
00:39:22,433 --> 00:39:24,667
Your phone!

814
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,999
Who does, uh, scott know in brooklyn?

815
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:37,633
No one.

816
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,567
Hello?

817
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:41,033
Hey. is this scott? i'm sorry.

818
00:39:41,034 --> 00:39:42,900
scott can't come to the phone right now

819
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:45,567
Can i give him a message? yeah, this is daniel humphrey.

820
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,200
He wrote me a letter, so, uh,

821
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:50,300
I guess if he wants to talk,

822
00:39:50,366 --> 00:39:53,467
Tell him he can-- he can give me a call back.

823
00:39:53,533 --> 00:39:56,033
Certainly. i'll pass the message along.

824
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:57,667
Okay. thank you.

825
00:39:57,733 --> 00:40:00,166
So who was it?

826
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:02,767
Scott wrote a letter to rufus humphrey's son.

827
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:04,433
Why would he--

828
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,467
He knows.

829
00:40:08,966 --> 00:40:11,900
How do you delete an incoming call?

830
00:40:11,966 --> 00:40:14,934
Mistakes, we all make them.

831
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:17,366
They usually start with the best of intentions,

832
00:40:17,433 --> 00:40:19,366
Like keeping a secret to protect someone...

833
00:40:19,433 --> 00:40:21,366
Ready? i'll be just a second.

834
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,433
Or getting some distance from the person you've become.

835
00:40:45,066 --> 00:40:49,900
Sometimes we don't even know what mistakes we've made to get where we are.

836
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,733
Or we figure it out just in time

837
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,867
To make it right again.

838
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,366
But every mistake happens for a reason--

839
00:41:12,433 --> 00:41:15,733
To teach you a lesson you would otherwise never learn...

840
00:41:17,466 --> 00:41:20,700
You were going to leave without saying good-bye.

841
00:41:20,767 --> 00:41:23,833
I knew you more like me than you were letting on.

842
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,333
Chuck, it's morning now, as in "cold light of,"

843
00:41:26,399 --> 00:41:28,666
As in "let's pretend last night didn't happen."

844
00:41:28,733 --> 00:41:33,833
We could just as easily as pretend of this that will happen so.

845
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:41,000
And hopefully you never make that mistake again.

846
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:42,566
So we're clear?

847
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,366
This is just between us.

848
00:41:44,433 --> 00:41:46,000
It means nothing.

849
00:41:46,067 --> 00:41:47,767
What means nothing?

850
00:41:56,067 --> 00:41:58,767
Lucky for me, that never happens

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
