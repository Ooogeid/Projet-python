1
00:00:00,772 --> 00:00:04,211
It was so much easier when it was just
about where we sat on the Met steps.

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,964
It's time for a new challenge
for both of us.

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,634
My father turned his first profit
by the time he was 22.

4
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:12,928
- I hope to do it by the time i'm 21.
- And how can you be so sure?

5
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,442
Because you believe in me.

6
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:16,307
You needed to kiss her again,

7
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,057
to realize for yourself
that your feelings for her are real.

8
00:00:19,182 --> 00:00:22,526
Vanessa, I love you. That's not really
the reaction I was hoping for.

9
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:25,149
- It's not easy being queen.
- Sounds like kind of a yawn.

10
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,735
Yes, compared to being
an international drug dealer.

11
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,192
A bit of danger
is what makes life worth living.

12
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,112
At the masquerade ball,
I {tried to tell you I loved you.

13
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,768
- You loved me?
- I hope I'm not interrupting.

14
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,037
Tripp is divorcing Maureen.
We're going away.

15
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,163
It's an error.

16
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,745
I love him,
and I'd do anything to make him happy.

17
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,705
- Where'd you get that?
- The question

18
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:47,155
is what your stepfather will say
when he knows that your mom cheats.

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,090
You left her alone
in a wrecked car?!

20
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:51,835
Stay away from her.

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,222
You're becoming a man in a way

22
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,013
that your father never was.

23
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,515
- Lily?
- Charles.

24
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,151
His beloved wife
died giving birth to me.

25
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,866

37
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,182
I feel the same way
about Dorota's return.

38
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,135
<i>I never should have agreed to let her
spend the holidays with Vanya.</i>

39
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,201
Did I tell you that he texts me
before he goes to sleep?

40
00:01:46,326 --> 00:01:47,377
It's so sweet.

41
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:51,257
Sexting is not sweet. It's off-limits
until you're in a relationship.

42
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,983
<i>You haven't been on a date.</i>

43
00:01:53,108 --> 00:01:55,123
You'll be happy to know
he asked me to go

44
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,372
to a dinner
for the french ambassador.

45
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,656
Chastity belts go very well
with formal wear.

46
00:02:00,945 --> 00:02:02,249
<i>I'm serious, S.</i>

47
00:02:02,374 --> 00:02:05,352
<i>I'm all for you trying with Nate,
but if you want it to become real,</i>

48
00:02:05,477 --> 00:02:07,842
then you're going
to have to take it slow.

49
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:09,784
<i>Okay, I promise I will.
I have to go.</i>

50
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,015
Damien Dalgaard!

51
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,047
- How are ya?
- Good.

52
00:02:25,172 --> 00:02:29,023
I thought you were gonna become
a belgian prince after boarding school.

53
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:31,442
My father took the ambassador post.

54
00:02:32,525 --> 00:02:34,945
You look even more fantastic
than you did in school.

55
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,494
Oh, that was not
a very good time for me.

56
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,409
That's not true. I seem to remember
some fun spanish classes.

57
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,563
Really? More like me crying
over conjugations

58
00:02:43,688 --> 00:02:45,196
while you got straight a's

59
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,063
and won all the athletic awards.

60
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,126
You had the Mr. Perfect thing down.

61
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:51,879
I'm late.

62
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,298
So, I'd love to catch up some more.

63
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,218
- Text me. Good to see you.
- You too.

64
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,487
Are you going
to the ambassador dinner tomorrow?

65
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,931
- I am.
- I'll see you there.

66
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:03,831
See you there.

67
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:15,969
You know how torturous it is for me
to find jewels that aren't for me.

68
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:18,021
It's just a worthless trinket

69
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:20,236
some woman left by
my father's grave.

70
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,411
You aren't even curious about someone
who wears your father around her neck?

71
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,044
One of his concubines had
his name tattooed on her ass.

72
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,793
I have more important things
to do than search

73
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,416
for another member
of the female Bart Bass fan club.

74
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:37,177
Like helping me achieve
the college experience I so deserve?

75
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:40,719
I assume you're referring
to my lunch to discuss

76
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,805
parisian hotel possibilities

77
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,682
with Henri Duris.

78
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,753
Who my research also tells me is

79
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:49,478
the rumored president
of <i>Table Élitaire.</i>

80
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:52,189
Just imagining my life as a member

81
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,681
of the most exclusive secret society
makes me tingle.

82
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:57,670
While I find that
incredibly arousing,

83
00:03:57,795 --> 00:04:00,322
you know I can't promise anything
but an introduction.

84
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:01,912
All I need to know is

85
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:04,326
that the most persuasive
and powerful man i've ever met

86
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,547
is on my side.

87
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,392
So how was your mom's?

88
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,233
I'm sure your dad called every day.

89
00:04:30,465 --> 00:04:32,342
Well, he v-chatted
for present opening.

90
00:04:32,993 --> 00:04:35,121
You didn't want to go
to Telluride with him, huh?

91
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:38,692
I can't say I blame you.
Those Lincoln Hawk guys can be annoying.

92
00:04:39,222 --> 00:04:42,908
He was so excited when it came up that
I couldn't stand for him to miss out.

93
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:47,119
Hi.

94
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,860
- Welcome home.
- Damien, hi.

95
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:53,345
You remember Damien, right?

96
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,762
- - Oh, yes. Hello.
- Mrs. Humphrey, how are you?

97
00:04:56,887 --> 00:04:58,964
And, uh, this is for you.

98
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,227
Thank you.

99
00:05:04,165 --> 00:05:07,711
Thank you, Lily, for helping me unpack,
but I think I'm good now.

100
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:11,839
A word, please?

101
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,818
So your father and I
haven't discussed

102
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,154
you having boys alone

103
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,531
in your room.
Maybe just keep the door open?

104
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,701
If we wanted to have sex,
we'd just go to a hotel.

105
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:30,600
And seriously,
it's not like that with us.

106
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:31,799
What is it like?

107
00:05:31,924 --> 00:05:33,816
I mean, he seems happy to see you.

108
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:37,447
I'll open the door
if anything changes.

109
00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:40,297
You wouldn't know
when your father was coming back?

110
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,800
Larissa accidentally lost
the itinerary.

111
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:46,045
I think he said today,
but just call him and ask.

112
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,174
So cookies. Let me guess.

113
00:05:57,299 --> 00:05:58,992
I have a puzzle that needs solving.

114
00:05:59,117 --> 00:06:01,421
I know how much
you Humphreys like games.

115
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,227
It's my work.

116
00:06:30,612 --> 00:06:33,069
Do you remember
who you sold this one to?

117
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,632
The picture's right there-
Bart Bass.

118
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,667
Do you know who he bought it for?

119
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:40,899
Mr. Bass kept the recipients
of his purchases private.

120
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:44,140
But a woman did bring this one

121
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,376
to repair the hinge
about a month ago.

122
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:48,382
The woman,

123
00:06:48,894 --> 00:06:51,483
early 40s, brown hair, brown eyes?

124
00:06:52,982 --> 00:06:56,686
I would be very grateful

125
00:06:57,832 --> 00:07:00,156
if you could share any other information
you may have.

126
00:07:01,352 --> 00:07:03,726
I'm sorry.
Client confidentiality.

127
00:07:05,522 --> 00:07:07,897
My father was the original client.

128
00:07:08,838 --> 00:07:12,014
Please, this is
all I have left of him.

129
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:22,545
Elizabeth Fisher.

130
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:24,347
She paid in cash.

131
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,608
But she had it delivered.

132
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,012
Thank you.

133
00:07:35,137 --> 00:07:36,356
<i>With enough time,</i>

134
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,649
<i>we all find what we're looking for</i>

135
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,715
<i>even if it was there all along.</i>

136
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:50,511
What are you doing here?

137
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,030
You were suppose to arrive tomorrow.

138
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:56,266
My grandfather got sick
of me texting you,

139
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:58,150
so the plane bring me home early.

140
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,841
Well, remind me to send him a gift.

141
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:08,904
I should go. I left the driver
downstairs waiting with the bags,

142
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,890
so i could surprise you, but

143
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:13,863
- tomorrow, though, right?
- Yes, our first official date.

144
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,533
I've been thinking, and I think

145
00:08:16,658 --> 00:08:19,702
that we should try
to take this slow.

146
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,105
Yeah. Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing.

147
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:34,012
<i>And when time slows,</i>

148
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,596
<i>and suddenly</i>

149
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:36,984
<i>every moment counts,</i>

150
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,092
<i>All you want is for this time
to last forever.</i>

152
00:08:51,802 --> 00:08:53,161
What? I'm not that late.

153
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,680
Oh, no. I'm sorry, man.

154
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:57,870
- I was just hoping you were Vanessa.
- Oh, you invited Vanessa here, too?

155
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,228
Not exactly.
But she does spend a lot of time here.

156
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,582
You still haven't talked to her?

157
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,560
Or gotten a text or seen her.

158
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:08,005
It's my fault.
I moved too fast.

159
00:09:08,562 --> 00:09:12,092
I read, like, five self-help blogs
about how to turn friends into lovers.

160
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:16,746
Yes, they use that word. I was
a little down at my mom's place.

161
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,054
- Man, i'm sorry. You know.
- They say to take things more slowly

162
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:21,909
with a friend than
with someone you met.

163
00:09:22,034 --> 00:09:23,142
I'll send it to you.

164
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,939
You might want to read it
before you start this thing with Serena.

165
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:35,282
Looks like my advice went
the way of the clog.

166
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,950
What are you talking about?

167
00:09:37,725 --> 00:09:38,833
The clog?

168
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:40,495
An ugly wooden shoe

169
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,623
That tried to make a statement,
then disappeared-

170
00:09:43,323 --> 00:09:45,709
Just like your resolve
to take things slow with Nate.

171
00:09:46,057 --> 00:09:48,669
I'm just gonna go with it.
You know, whatever happens, happens.

172
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,628
Knowing Serena,
what'll probably happen is

173
00:09:51,753 --> 00:09:53,300
she'll get swept up in the romance,

174
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,136
and she's not gonna want to talk
about any of that stuff ever. Really.

175
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,723
Nah, look, it's cool. I've known Serena
since I was a little kid.

176
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,532
And we've already... you know,
years ago.

177
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,978
I know. Trust me.

178
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:05,938
Now I can see that Nate and I

179
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,440
were only perfect on paper.

180
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:09,024
But

181
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,818
you and Nate can finally be more
than just an affair to remember.

182
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,538
Which is why we didn't want
to wait for it to start.

183
00:10:14,663 --> 00:10:17,046
And why you don't want
to scare him off.

184
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,201
The point is
I've dated serena for over a year.

185
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,245
And if you want to be able
to make things work,

186
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,253
you'llhave to be able
to come up for air,

187
00:10:23,378 --> 00:10:25,176
which is not
her favorite thing to do.

188
00:10:25,477 --> 00:10:28,701
You are the one thing Nate
has always wanted and could never have.

189
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,976
It's like a diet.

190
00:10:30,101 --> 00:10:33,077
After years of starvation, You can't
let him gorge on sundaes.

191
00:10:33,202 --> 00:10:35,046
He'll panic
and decide he hates ice cream.

192
00:10:35,513 --> 00:10:36,882
Except I'm not ice cream,

193
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,471
and Nate and I don't need
to play games.

194
00:10:39,757 --> 00:10:41,723
Everyone needs to play games.

195
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,017
You've already failed
to come out of the gate

196
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,748
with any restraint or control.

197
00:10:45,873 --> 00:10:49,320
Now all you can do is introduce
some competition, make him work for it.

198
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,276
Blair, that's the worst advice
i've ever heard.

199
00:10:53,564 --> 00:10:55,237
Wait till
he starts passing on dessert.

200
00:10:57,461 --> 00:10:59,592
So the ambassador's daughter's
gonna be at this dinner?

201
00:10:59,717 --> 00:11:02,517
Yeah, but her father's got her
under 24-hour surveillance,

202
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:04,943
Which means her guards
will be on her at all times.

203
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:09,756
I can meet her in the ladies' room.
I bet they don't follow her in there.

204
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,028
Or we could switch handbags.

205
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,020
You need to know.
This is a state dinner,

206
00:11:14,145 --> 00:11:15,924
so there's security everywhere.

207
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,843
All bags will be searched.

208
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,345
The problem is not getting
the package to Violette,

209
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,932
It's getting the package in
in the first place.

210
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,439
I could wear it.

211
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,484
I can make this. Only in mine,
the paillettes won't be empty.

212
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:38,248
You put the pills

213
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:40,165
in the jacket?

214
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,648
Yeah, I wear it to the dinner,

215
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:45,704
Check it and then Violette and I
switch coat check tags.

216
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,372
I take her coat

217
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,291
and she'll leave with yours.

218
00:11:51,662 --> 00:11:52,982
It's not bad.

219
00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:54,996
Not bad?

220
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:57,215
Come on. It's brilliant!

221
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,309
- What are you doing in Brooklyn?
- I hoped your father would be here.

222
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:11,002
He was supposed to be back this morning.
I can't imagine he'd come here first.

223
00:12:11,127 --> 00:12:14,306
Well, i just figured since he hadn't
seen you over the holidays

224
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,346
you know how sentimental he is.

225
00:12:16,471 --> 00:12:17,319
Yeah. Dad?

226
00:12:20,854 --> 00:12:23,112
Well, you know what?
Maybe he decided to stay

227
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,826
and ski another day.

228
00:12:25,182 --> 00:12:27,496
Yeah, I don't think
that's what happened.

229
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,211
I should go.
If you see him,

230
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,380
- Tell him i stopped by.
- Okay.

231
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:46,723
Vronsky, where are you?

232
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,462
Anna Karenina texted you an hour ago.
<i>She wants to celebrate.</i>

233
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:53,923
Sorry, but Anna will have to wait.
I'm about to walk into a meeting.

234
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,137
With monsieur duris? Are you bringing
him here to surprise me?

235
00:12:57,262 --> 00:12:59,611
As it turns out,
I wasn't able to attend the lunch.

236
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:02,364
Are you in the hospital?

237
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:06,116
Since I know that you're alive,
There could be no other possible reason

238
00:13:06,241 --> 00:13:07,668
you would sacrifice my future.

239
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,602
I'll get you
your introduction, okay?

240
00:13:09,727 --> 00:13:13,119
Monsieur Duris will be attending
the dinner for the french ambassador.

241
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:15,210
Oh, thank god.

242
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,548
- You nearly gave me a heart attack.
- Why didn't you mention this earlier?

243
00:13:19,903 --> 00:13:22,843
I just assumed you'd rather not
cross paths with Carla Bruni.

244
00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:26,721
In times of crisis,

245
00:13:27,428 --> 00:13:28,974
sacrifices must be made.

246
00:13:30,636 --> 00:13:32,269
Why did you miss lunch?

247
00:13:33,863 --> 00:13:36,982
Iwant to meet someone whose schedule is
even more unpredictable than mine.

248
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,250
I'll see you tonight.

249
00:13:46,563 --> 00:13:48,452
I've been waiting here
for four hours.

250
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,745
Has Elizabeth Fisher
still not returned?

251
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:52,780
She did return, mr. Bass.

252
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,754
Then why did she not get my message
that i was waiting for her in the bar?

253
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:58,628
She did. She checked out of the hotel
immediately afterwards.

254
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,664
It's Anna Karenina. You never
read it. Don't worry about it.

255
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:12,976
I never do.

256
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:30,285
What are you doing here?

257
00:14:31,946 --> 00:14:33,288
Making a decision.

258
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:36,833
How are you doing?
Did you end up going away?

259
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,360
I got back this morning.

260
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,880
And are you back for good?

261
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,425
That's what I'm deciding.

262
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,259
I came over to talk to Lily,
but now I'm not sure.

263
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,085
I want to give her a chance
to explain.

264
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,638
But still, there's a part of me
that doesn't want to know.

265
00:14:55,806 --> 00:14:56,770
Cup of coffee?

266
00:14:58,469 --> 00:14:59,773
It's freezing out here.

267
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:02,984
Coffee actually sounds really good.

268
00:15:03,307 --> 00:15:05,413
Okay. Thank you.

269
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:09,366
Thank you.

270
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,708
- I was just about to call you.
- Well, now you don't have to.

271
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,882
Or we don't have to talk at all.

272
00:15:27,574 --> 00:15:28,794
Look, I...

273
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,180
I was just thinking that
maybe it might make sense

274
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,932
if i go to that dinner alone.

275
00:15:34,756 --> 00:15:36,977
I don't understand.
Did i do something wrong?

276
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,979
No. No, not at all. I just...

277
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:42,232
you know, we said we didn't want
to rush into things.

278
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:45,176
Yeah, but that was
before we saw each other.

279
00:15:45,462 --> 00:15:47,946
I know. But i'm just trying
to stick to the plan here.

280
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:50,642
Okay, so the plan went
from having sex

281
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:53,489
on eleanor waldorf's floor
to not seeing each other?

282
00:15:53,614 --> 00:15:55,434
Just because we lost track
for a minute there

283
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:57,289
doesn't mean
we should forget about it.

284
00:15:57,594 --> 00:15:59,457
I mean, we already
saw each other today.

285
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,459
We can wait
a couple more days, right?

286
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:06,506
You're right, Nate. The last thing
I want to do is rush into something.

287
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,076
Serena, come on.

288
00:16:30,727 --> 00:16:31,489
Hello?

289
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,033
Hey, Damien.

290
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:36,453
Serena. Don't tell me you need
help with your spanish homework.

291
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:38,644
No, french this time.
Please tell me

292
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:40,915
you don't have a date
to the ambassador's dinner.

293
00:16:41,238 --> 00:16:43,414
Are you asking me
if i want to go with you?

294
00:16:43,907 --> 00:16:45,337
Of course I do.

295
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,519
Great. I'm staying at the Waldorfs',

296
00:16:47,644 --> 00:16:50,062
So i'll text you the address.
I'll see you tomorrow.

297
00:16:50,187 --> 00:16:52,594
<i>Heure, hora, laat.</i>

298
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,532
<i>No matter what language
you say it in,</i>

299
00:16:54,657 --> 00:16:56,872
<i>looks like S.
Just started the clock</i>

300
00:16:56,997 --> 00:16:59,345
<i>on a ticking time bomb.</i>

301
00:17:11,886 --> 00:17:13,571
I thought you'd be at school by now.

302
00:17:13,696 --> 00:17:16,318
I thought you lived
in the Upper East Side with your wife.

303
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:22,380
Lily came by yesterday looking for you.
What's going on?

304
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,615
We had a fight.
It's complicated.

305
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,530
Israeli-Palestinian complicated
by the looks of it.

306
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:29,798
Is this why you shipped
Jenny and me off to mom's

307
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,923
- for christmas?
- This was her year.

308
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:34,088
And it wasn't one of those
"parent trap" situations

309
00:17:34,213 --> 00:17:35,845
that you and Jenny
could swoop in on.

310
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,598
We need time to figure this out.

311
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:41,661
And you're doing that
by not telling her where you are?

312
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,968
It's not the best strategy,
but until I talk to her,

313
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:47,276
at least I can hold out hope
that i'm wrong about what happened.

314
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,971
So you're not talking to her
because you don't want to hear

315
00:17:50,096 --> 00:17:51,778
what you think she might tell you?

316
00:17:52,354 --> 00:17:54,656
You know, I'm not willing
to explain myself, Dan.

317
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,580
All right. Fine. Fine. You can make
your own damn waffles.

318
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,652
Come on, Dan.

319
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:06,177
Listen, you're the one
who's always saying to be honest

320
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,673
and talk about things,
so i really hope you're not gonna let

321
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,515
your marriage die because you're scared
to take your own advice.

322
00:18:21,574 --> 00:18:22,373
Ta-Da!

323
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:25,395
All the girls are gonna want
to wear pharmaceuticals.

324
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:26,839
It's perfect.

325
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:28,982
I'm impressed.

326
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:29,876
Thanks.

327
00:18:30,362 --> 00:18:32,318
I'm really excited about tonight.

328
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,549
Yeah. Yeah.
Me, too.

329
00:18:36,974 --> 00:18:40,932
Unfortunately, we're gonna have
to do our little dinner some other time.

330
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:45,887
What? I thought
we were doing this together.

331
00:18:46,012 --> 00:18:47,167
It's my plan.

332
00:18:47,506 --> 00:18:48,299
Yeah.

333
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,730
I know. And I thank you.
It's just that

334
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:54,863
anyone can check the jacket.

335
00:19:00,924 --> 00:19:03,650
I'm going with someone else
Serena, actually.

336
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,716
We're old friends
from boarding school.

337
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:08,563
Serena's with nate now.

338
00:19:09,521 --> 00:19:12,192
I don't know about that. She's the one
who called and asked me, so...

339
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:16,093
You know she's changed
since boarding school,

340
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,219
and there's no way
she's gonna go to a state dinner

341
00:19:19,344 --> 00:19:20,871
wearing a jacket filled with pills.

342
00:19:22,546 --> 00:19:24,402
I probably won't tell her
about that then.

343
00:19:25,322 --> 00:19:26,568
Well, then maybe I will.

344
00:19:27,675 --> 00:19:29,023
See, if you were to do that,

345
00:19:29,148 --> 00:19:31,936
then I would have to tell her
how you know, obviously.

346
00:19:34,202 --> 00:19:35,193
So...

347
00:19:35,702 --> 00:19:36,414
anyway,

348
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,595
Don't worry.
You'll still get your cut.

349
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,520
What's going on?

350
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,105
- Why aren't you dressed?
- Look, Blair, i'm sorry.

351
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:53,441
But i won't be able to join you
for <i>dîner ce soir</i>.

352
00:19:54,515 --> 00:19:57,975
Abandoning me in a fur hat is one thing,
but you can't do this.

353
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,104
You already missed the lunch.

354
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:02,909
You know my dreams are dead without
a proper introduction to Mr. Duris.

355
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:05,243
I left word with his people
that you'd be there, okay?

356
00:20:05,368 --> 00:20:07,664
I'm sure you'll find a way to make an
impression.

357
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:10,416
This is about her, isn't it?

358
00:20:11,113 --> 00:20:12,710
The floozy from your father's grave

359
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,832
You said
you had no interest in finding.

360
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,889
It appears I may have spoken
too quickly in that regard.

361
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:20,510
First you lie to me,

362
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,846
and now you sacrifice
my table élitaire

363
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,907
charter to go
look for some random woman.

364
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,840
You obviously read the file,

365
00:20:27,296 --> 00:20:28,765
so you know she's not random.

366
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,229
She knew
my mother's favorite flowers,

367
00:20:31,354 --> 00:20:33,173
she had a picture of my father
in her jewelry

368
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,732
and she knew me.

369
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,694
And clearly has no interest
in being found by you.

370
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,904
You've been looking for weeks,
and nothing.

371
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,573
One dinner won't make a difference.

372
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,595
You may find this hard to comprehend,
but some things are more important

373
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,724
than your social-Climbing agenda.

374
00:21:20,398 --> 00:21:21,652
His name's Damien.

375
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:26,284
He's the son
of the belgian ambassador,

376
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,763
and i'm pretty sure they
hooked up at boarding school.

377
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,725
I'm guessing Serena didn't tell you
she was coming with him, huh?

378
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,138
No. No, she didn't.

379
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,779
Why are you here?

380
00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:36,836
I figured you've come to
my rescue enough times.

381
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,838
Let me help you for once.

382
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,926
<i>Hi. May I take your coat?</i>

383
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,641
- You came with him?
- You came with her?

384
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,268
I think you're at the wrong place.
Prom is down the street.

385
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,229
Oh, that's fine. I'll just let you
get back to your euro-fawning.

386
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:03,134
- What are you doing here?
- What I started.

387
00:22:04,268 --> 00:22:06,824
Serena, I love your jacket.
It's so beautiful.

388
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,624
Yeah, let me help you with that.

389
00:22:08,749 --> 00:22:10,766
No, it's okay.
I'm gonna keep it on.

390
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,161
It's so pretty,
and it was a gift from you.

391
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,893
So sweet of you.

392
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,250
Come on.

393
00:22:18,288 --> 00:22:22,097
<i>So much for diplomacy.
Let the international games begin.</i>

394
00:22:50,672 --> 00:22:54,017
Serena. And... not Nate.

395
00:22:54,142 --> 00:22:55,832
Hi. I'm Blair.

396
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:56,774
Damien.

397
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:57,921
A pleasure.

398
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,779
The french ambassador's daughter's
an old friend of mine.

399
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,359
I'm gonna let you guys.

400
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,860
Excuse me.

401
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,830
I see you took my advice.

402
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,032
It's good to keep Nate on his toes.

403
00:23:09,157 --> 00:23:11,986
- And nice choice of competition.
- Thank you.

404
00:23:12,111 --> 00:23:13,807
Your idea's completely juvenile,

405
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:15,839
but it seems to be working.

406
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,509
I'm Jenny. Nice to meet you.
Thank you so much.

407
00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:21,820
I can't believe he came with Jenny.

408
00:23:21,945 --> 00:23:24,152
<i>If I know Jenny, she came with him.</i>

409
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,654
But trust me. This is
exactly what you wanted.

410
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:30,020
Games will be played,
sexual innuendo ensues.

411
00:23:30,145 --> 00:23:32,869
And in the end,
Nate will be right where you wanted him.

412
00:23:33,553 --> 00:23:34,498
My problems

413
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,154
are not nearly

414
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,627
so easily resolved.

415
00:23:38,816 --> 00:23:41,544
Even monsieur Duris' entourage
is perfection

416
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,700
in bone structure and styling.

417
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,174
While without a formal introduction,
I have no choice

418
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,843
- but to stalk him.
- Blair, you know you don't need Chuck.

419
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,207
Anyone can see

420
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,976
you're an elitist snob who's perfect
to run a secret society.

421
00:23:53,703 --> 00:23:54,978
<i>Bonne chance.</i>

422
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:57,271
<i>Ah! Merci.</i>

423
00:24:07,144 --> 00:24:09,197
<i>On a un petit souci, mais</i>

424
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,995
<i>je t'assure que tu l'auras
au prix demandé à la fin de la soirée.</i>

425
00:24:12,378 --> 00:24:15,119
<i>Tu as intérêt, sinon, j'appellerai</i>

426
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,400
<i>le flic
pour cette garce qui le porte.</i>

427
00:24:18,914 --> 00:24:20,327
Hi. I'm Jenny.

428
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:30,280
French people really are rude.

429
00:24:30,672 --> 00:24:32,970
She's usually
a much happier customer.

430
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,306
Looks like the plan's off the rails.

431
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,268
From what I recall from boarding school,
it wasn't difficult

432
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,020
to get Serena out of her clothes.

433
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,351
That jacket is not leaving
this party on Serena Van Der Woodsen.

434
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:49,695
I don't know why
you're here with him.

435
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,698
I mean, if you're trying to make me
jealous, there's no reason to.

436
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,938
I want to be here with you.
I invited you.

437
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,806
But then you uninvited me.

438
00:24:57,037 --> 00:25:00,043
But you're right.
Taking it slow was the right decision.

439
00:25:00,168 --> 00:25:02,166
Hi. Damien.

440
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:04,585
Nate Archibald.

441
00:25:05,357 --> 00:25:08,351
Serena, let me
introduce you to some people.

442
00:25:09,005 --> 00:25:10,716
Thanks for keeping my date company.

443
00:25:13,488 --> 00:25:17,393
So what's the deal with Nate, he seemed
like he wanted to cut my head off?

444
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:18,938
Is he an ex-boyfriend?

445
00:25:19,063 --> 00:25:22,145
Oh, possibly a new one.
Honestly, that's the reason

446
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,901
I asked you to bring me
here tonight. I'm sorry.

447
00:25:25,026 --> 00:25:26,970
No, don't be.
The old make-him-jealous-

448
00:25:27,095 --> 00:25:29,772
- by-bringing-the-titled-european ploy.
- Yep.

449
00:25:29,897 --> 00:25:32,155
I'm flattered you thought
I was worthy of the task.

450
00:25:32,508 --> 00:25:34,244
Thank you for understanding.

451
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:37,034
If you really want to make him
jealous, though,

452
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,619
I suggest we commit

453
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:41,084
fully, you know?

454
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:43,878
- Let me take off this jacket.
- No, Damien.

455
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:45,853
I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

456
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:48,858
This was a huge mistake already.
I...

457
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,127
No, no, no.
We can make it better.

458
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:52,842
No strings attached.

459
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:56,177
Damien, I don't like you like that.
I mean it.

460
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,406
Are you serious?

461
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:03,439
What happened to the Serena that
I wanted throughout boarding school?

462
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:06,300
I've changed, and it's a good thing.

463
00:26:10,712 --> 00:26:12,678
I'm sorry.
That wasn't...

464
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:22,358
<i>Monsieur Duris?</i>

465
00:26:22,853 --> 00:26:24,427
<i>C'est vous n'est-ce pas?</i>

466
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:27,730
I'm sorry.
Have we been introduced?

467
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,459
I'm Blair Waldorf.
Perhaps you've heard of me?

468
00:26:30,584 --> 00:26:31,499
I submitted

469
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,736
a charter application for N.Y.U.

470
00:26:36,145 --> 00:26:37,990
Can you just hold on one minute?

471
00:26:38,115 --> 00:26:40,069
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

472
00:26:41,712 --> 00:26:43,815
- Chuck.
- There you are.

473
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,785
I knew you'd see
the error of your ways.

474
00:26:46,097 --> 00:26:48,918
Monsieur Duris just stepped out
to smoke, which gives us

475
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,087
two and a half minutes, maybe four.

476
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,735
I came to apologize.

477
00:26:53,915 --> 00:26:54,904
What happened?

478
00:26:55,415 --> 00:26:58,157
Don't tell me that awful whore
did something terrible to you.

479
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:01,663
I think that whore may be my mother.

480
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,536
There you are.

481
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:13,576
Serena's about to leave.
You need to stop her.

482
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,312
You know what, Jenny?
This just isn't fun for me anymore.

483
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:18,391
I should have never listened to Dan.

484
00:27:18,516 --> 00:27:20,216
Okay, I don't know what Dan said,

485
00:27:20,341 --> 00:27:23,453
but why would you take romantic advice
from a guy who has a Cabbage Patch doll?

486
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:24,685
I don't know.

487
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:27,437
All you need to know
is I blew my chance.

488
00:27:29,236 --> 00:27:31,351
The masquerade ball was
two years ago.

489
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,902
Don't let Serena get away again.

490
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,459
You know your mother
died during childbirth.

491
00:27:39,776 --> 00:27:41,004
What if she didn't?

492
00:27:41,568 --> 00:27:44,007
What if it was just
another of my father's many lies?

493
00:27:44,132 --> 00:27:44,853
Look,

494
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:47,367
it makes sense that

495
00:27:47,848 --> 00:27:50,079
when you finally let your father go,

496
00:27:50,848 --> 00:27:53,823
- your mother would reappear.
- She's not a ghost, Blair.

497
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,404
Don't you think I know
how crazy this sounds?

498
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,858
It's why I couldn't tell you
or anyone.

499
00:28:02,117 --> 00:28:04,427
I'm aware that
one of Bart's old girlfriends

500
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,225
may have known my name,

501
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:09,557
and maybe even look like
old pictures of my mother.

502
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,460
But my father only had one of these
made with an "e" on it.

503
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,641
- This woman had it.
- Whoever she is,

504
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,843
it just seems like...

505
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,913
She'll make losing your mom
hurt all over again.

506
00:28:24,191 --> 00:28:25,715
Do you really think

507
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,584
anything could be more painful

508
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:30,586
than killing my own mother

509
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:33,324
and having my father hate me
for it my whole life?

510
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,712
If there is any chance

511
00:28:38,564 --> 00:28:41,331
this isn't what happened,
I have to know.

512
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,057
I don't want to keep you
from your business with monsieur Duris.

513
00:28:47,378 --> 00:28:48,755
I just had to let you know.

514
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:53,814
Nothing

515
00:28:53,992 --> 00:28:56,685
is more important
than being with you for this.

516
00:29:03,188 --> 00:29:05,155
<i>Sometimes despite the risk,</i>

517
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,582
<i>the only thing to do is
seize the moment</i>

518
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,487
<i>or whatever else you can grab.</i>

519
00:29:16,878 --> 00:29:20,216
I really always hope that Blair
is wrong about these things,

520
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,885
but if you want to be with me
because I'm with someone else,

521
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:25,125
- you can forget it.
- I want to be with you.

522
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,154
I got scared
that if we moved too fast

523
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,028
things weren't gonna work out,

524
00:29:29,153 --> 00:29:31,185
and I really don't want
that to happen.

525
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:33,145
Okay, because I've waited...

526
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,506
I've waited
a really long time for this.

527
00:29:35,931 --> 00:29:37,274
Me, too.

528
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,973
We need to talk.

529
00:30:10,218 --> 00:30:11,350
Rufus, finally.

530
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:13,978
I must have called you
a hundred times.

531
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,188
I told you I'd call you back
when I was ready.

532
00:30:17,037 --> 00:30:20,556
I guess I just didn't expect it
to take quite so long.

533
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:24,386
Well, I guess you should have thought
about that before you...

534
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:28,432
spent the night in a hotel room
with your ex-husband.

535
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,625
Well, I'm here now.

536
00:30:34,372 --> 00:30:36,667
So why don't you tell me exactly
what happened?

537
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,389
Lil, I'm not interested
in any more lies.

538
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,220
We should probably go.

539
00:31:00,863 --> 00:31:02,469
Let's finish what we started.

540
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:27,251
Not having any fun?

541
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,968
No. No, but you go ahead
and have yours.

542
00:31:32,093 --> 00:31:34,682
Please... gloat.

543
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:36,254
You've earned it.

544
00:31:37,014 --> 00:31:40,263
You're always telling me that this is
a business and not my social life,

545
00:31:40,388 --> 00:31:42,869
but yet you're the one
who screwed up a major deal

546
00:31:42,994 --> 00:31:44,902
'cause you wanted
to fulfill a high school dream

547
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,936
of a night
with Serena Van Der Woodsen.

548
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,833
Irony duly noted.

549
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,932
Maybe next time
you won't be so quick to dismiss me.

550
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:55,903
I don't know
if there will be a next time.

551
00:31:56,028 --> 00:31:58,391
Word of this botched job will
get around to my clients.

552
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,400
And I owe Violette more money

553
00:32:00,525 --> 00:32:02,294
than I could steal back
from my father,

554
00:32:03,265 --> 00:32:05,506
so it's time for me
to head back to the continent.

555
00:32:17,044 --> 00:32:18,811
Why is that jacket on the floor?

556
00:32:19,675 --> 00:32:22,526
It belongs to the ambassador's daughter.
She'll be furious.

557
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,068
Hang it up and make sure
that Violette gets it when she leaves.

558
00:32:31,136 --> 00:32:33,784
Looks like you can cancel
that transatlantic ticket.

559
00:32:34,092 --> 00:32:35,411
I guess so.

560
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:44,587
Elizabeth?

561
00:32:45,651 --> 00:32:47,673
I'm sorry. Have we met?

562
00:32:48,078 --> 00:32:50,372
You ran away from me
at my father's grave.

563
00:32:51,156 --> 00:32:52,114
Charles Bass.

564
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,458
Oh, of course.

565
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:56,159
I apologize for my sudden departure.

566
00:32:56,284 --> 00:32:57,850
It was a very emotional day.

567
00:32:58,371 --> 00:33:00,185
You must have known my father well.

568
00:33:01,369 --> 00:33:03,336
I'm not sure what gives you
that impression.

569
00:33:04,071 --> 00:33:06,779
Your father and I
simply shared a few

570
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,612
memorable months many years ago.

571
00:33:09,745 --> 00:33:11,641
I was actually visiting
my mother's grave,

572
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:14,908
and I just stopped
to pay my respects.

573
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,703
At that time of the night?

574
00:33:18,724 --> 00:33:20,865
On the anniversary
of my father's death?

575
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,462
I saw you had his favorite flowers.

576
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:26,962
And you knew who I was.

577
00:33:27,658 --> 00:33:28,554
I'm sorry.

578
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:32,217
I read that Bart had a son,
And you look just like your father.

579
00:33:32,633 --> 00:33:34,002
Most people

580
00:33:34,127 --> 00:33:36,592
say I more closely resemble
my mother.

581
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,172
I wouldn't know.

582
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:41,018
I never had the pleasure
of meeting her.

583
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,317
Well, maybe...

584
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,607
you can tell me why

585
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:46,947
you had her locket.

586
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,006
Your father gave it to me.

587
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:55,352
The "E" is for "Elizabeth".

588
00:33:57,777 --> 00:33:59,968
I loved to believe
it was a special gift.

589
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:05,364
I'm fairly certain he gave it
to all his girlfriends at the time.

590
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:09,630
You can keep it, if you'd like.

591
00:34:10,202 --> 00:34:12,925
I'm sure it means a great deal
more to you than it does to me.

592
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:18,681
I'm sorry I can't help you find

593
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:20,629
whatever it is you're looking for.

594
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:34,713
Blair, I'm sorry

595
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:38,286
to waste your time. You should
have stayed with monsieur Duris.

596
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:41,161
I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.

597
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,551
I'm just going to visit
the ladies' room.

598
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:47,459
Then we'll leave.

599
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:49,112
I'll bring the car around.

600
00:34:58,196 --> 00:34:59,304
Elizabeth.

601
00:35:04,128 --> 00:35:06,645
I already told your friend
everything I know.

602
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,233
And he may have bought it.

603
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:10,638
But I originated

604
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,566
that innocent, doe-eyed stare.

605
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,486
I usually employ it when I know
more than I'm willing to let on.

606
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,554
Chuck...

607
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:22,392
spent his entire life

608
00:35:23,532 --> 00:35:25,660
believing that he killed his mother.

609
00:35:28,847 --> 00:35:30,839
If you know anything

610
00:35:32,814 --> 00:35:35,093
that could take away
even a second of that pain,

611
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,029
it would be cruel not to share it.

612
00:35:42,029 --> 00:35:43,074
Otherwise,

613
00:35:45,328 --> 00:35:48,331
leaving town means never having
to say you're sorry.

614
00:35:50,612 --> 00:35:53,275
<i>Could there be a secret
even B. can't crack?</i>

615
00:35:54,397 --> 00:35:56,153
<i>Only time will tell.</i>

616
00:35:57,398 --> 00:35:58,369
I was exhausted.

617
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,575
I was scared. I thought
my mother was going to die.

618
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,911
He's a doctor. He knew people
that could help her.

619
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,938
- I had to seek him out.
- I already knew

620
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,631
about Cece being sick,

621
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,584
and I know that she got better.

622
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,728
I'm not gonna sit here for another hour
while you talk around this thing.

623
00:36:13,853 --> 00:36:15,853
- What do you want me to tell you?
- Tell me

624
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,580
that you weren't with him
while I was taking care of our kids.

625
00:36:18,705 --> 00:36:21,152
Tell me that you didn't sleep
with your ex-husband.

626
00:36:25,676 --> 00:36:26,975
I didn't sleep with him.

627
00:36:29,412 --> 00:36:30,549
I did kiss him,

628
00:36:31,632 --> 00:36:32,646
but that's all.

629
00:36:33,935 --> 00:36:37,277
It must have been one hell of a kiss
for you to build all these lies.

630
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,614
Look, I promise.
It didn't mean anything.

631
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:41,952
We were engaged.

632
00:36:42,848 --> 00:36:44,201
It means something to me.

633
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:49,298
Where are you going?

634
00:36:50,245 --> 00:36:51,792
I need time to figure this out,

635
00:36:52,174 --> 00:36:53,544
away from you.

636
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,006
Oh, Rufus, please,

637
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,049
come back home so we can...

638
00:36:59,882 --> 00:37:01,625
so we can work this out.

639
00:37:05,527 --> 00:37:07,730
Hey, Vanessa.
It's me.

640
00:37:08,738 --> 00:37:10,419
I haven't heard from you in a while,

641
00:37:10,544 --> 00:37:13,842
so I'm guessing that means
you don't want to hear from me.

642
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:17,594
But, anyway,
things around here aren't-

643
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:19,461
aren't so great right now.

644
00:37:20,058 --> 00:37:21,938
You know, with my dad and Lily...

645
00:37:24,017 --> 00:37:26,494
So I don't know. If you get a minute,
I could use a friend.

646
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,983
I think we're pushing our luck
at this point.

647
00:38:21,108 --> 00:38:22,918
- Yeah.
- We should go now.

648
00:38:23,752 --> 00:38:25,923
Will you grab my jacket and dress?

649
00:38:40,209 --> 00:38:41,485
Hey, I don't see it.

650
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:42,903
It's not here.

651
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:52,245
It's a perfect fit.

652
00:38:54,728 --> 00:38:57,180
Well, I'm glad
you're sticking around for a while.

653
00:38:57,305 --> 00:38:58,699
Me, too.
Here.

654
00:38:59,272 --> 00:38:59,932
No.

655
00:39:00,578 --> 00:39:02,172
This wasn't a date.

656
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,467
If you want one, you'll have to ask.

657
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,931
<i>With enough time,
eventually we all see</i>

658
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,766
<i>what was right in front of us...</i>

659
00:39:13,994 --> 00:39:15,849
- Thank you.
- Don't mind us.

660
00:39:15,974 --> 00:39:17,215
Oh, great service.

661
00:39:18,513 --> 00:39:21,024
Hey, that girl's got my coat.

662
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,355
This was probably
the best first date ever.

663
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,410
Promise me no more slow.

664
00:39:28,252 --> 00:39:30,534
What if it's the good kind of slow?

665
00:39:38,747 --> 00:39:41,384
<i>And realize no matter
how long it took,</i>

666
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:43,213
<i>it was worth the wait.</i>

667
00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:51,754
Are you all right?

668
00:39:53,882 --> 00:39:55,611
I spent 18 years

669
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:59,414
accepting the fact
my mother was dead.

670
00:40:00,486 --> 00:40:02,160
I was misguided

671
00:40:03,249 --> 00:40:05,996
to let one
of my father's girlfriends

672
00:40:06,983 --> 00:40:08,684
allow me to question that,

673
00:40:10,089 --> 00:40:12,293
to hope things may be different.

674
00:40:16,072 --> 00:40:19,374
Your real mother would never
turn her back on a chance to know you.

675
00:40:20,267 --> 00:40:22,614
I don't have a real mother, Blair.

676
00:40:23,863 --> 00:40:25,133
I never will.

677
00:40:34,693 --> 00:40:36,846
That doesn't mean you're alone.

678
00:40:38,515 --> 00:40:40,562
I love you, Chuck,

679
00:40:40,842 --> 00:40:42,784
and I'll always be your family.

680
00:41:07,094 --> 00:41:10,853
<i>But for some, that time never comes.</i>

681
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,993
<i>Instead of healing old wounds</i>

682
00:41:25,118 --> 00:41:27,436
<i>the wait just opens new ones</i>

683
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:32,614
<i>time after time.</i>
