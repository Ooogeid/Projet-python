1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,450
Gossip Girl here

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,920
Your one and only source

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,650
into the scandalous lives 
of Manhattan's elite.

4
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,570
I actually thought this 
time would be different

5
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,620
But you're just the same girl 
you always were.

6
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,750
It's stupid for you to want 
her to be anything other...

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,640
than she is. NoW she just needs 
someone to believe in her.

8
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,340
Dan was denied financial aid at Yale.

9
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,540
I mean, I could help you out

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,330
I think this is something 
I have to handle on my own.

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,650
- I'm Gabriel. 
- Gabriel and Poppy were over.

12
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,400
And it's not like either one of us planned this.

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,320
This-- this thing between us just happened,

14
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,700
- And we couldn't stop it. 
- Would you like to join us?

15
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,480
I'd love to meet the people in Serena's life.

16
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,840
Eventually, every queen finds herself

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,350
In unfamiliar territory 
outside the castle walls.

18
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,740
In Blair Waldorf's case-- 
the Village.

19
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,740
NYU? Ugh, what was I thinking?

20
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,100
You know how I feel 
about ironic facial hair.

21
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,220
Well, you were thinking

22
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,680
"A," you're lucky to get 
into a school at all,

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,300
And "B," you're super lucky 
'cause where you got in

24
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,610
happens to be in the same city as your

25
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,100
- Fantastic boyfriend
- That's true

26
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,460
I've been coming down here for years,

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,800
And I'm gonna teach you 
everything you need to know--

28
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,140
The best latte, the best slice, 
the best pot dealer.

29
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,450
But first, the most important lesson of all--

30
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,890
How to ride the subway.

31
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,860
Nate, you're sweet...

32
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,110
But obviously, you've inhaled too much patchouli.

33
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,050
There's no way I'm going down there.

34
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,820
It's full of mole men and 
middle-class professionals.

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,910
Well, you have to learn.

36
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,360
How else are you gonna visit me at Columbia?

37
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,550
Why do you think God gave us car service?

38
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,610
Our schools are at opposite poles of Manhattan.

39
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,120
I mean, in traffic, it could take hours.

40
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,570
The subway's definitely the quickest way.

41
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,230
Please don't ask this stuff to me.

42
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,400
Anything you want, Dan.

43
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,100
You're graduating high school,
that's a big deal.

44
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,740
How about a trunk? 
Trunks  are great for storage.

45
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,850
Books-- you're gonna have 
a lot of books at college.

46
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,090
Hey, Jenny, maybe you need a trunk too. 
Any one you want.

47
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,980
Dad, what's with this newfound 
interest in antiquing?

48
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,500
Oh, I'm just stimulating the economy

49
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,390
by rewarding my fantastic kids,

50
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,000
And it so happens that the, uh, 
gallery was a great investment

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,740
It's listing for three times what I paid for it.

52
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,060
You didn't get sold when 
the real estate bubble burst?

53
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,700
Well, it's not as much as I would've gotten

54
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,960
at the top of the market, but I'll be able

55
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,210
to send you both to school

56
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,690
and have a little breathing room 
to figure out what I want to do next

57
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,980
Setting up cooking classes

58
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,690
I mean, even I'm getting tired of your waffles,

59
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,700
Not cool. I sometimes make chili.

60
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,610
It looks a little delicate for your hand.

61
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,160
Don't get any ideas, big shot.

62
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,050
I'm just looking.

63
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,970
It's Lily. One sec.

64
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,720
Check out what dad was looking at.

65
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,400
Rats go underground. Not Waldorfs.

66
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Well, you can always borrow 
Chuck's helicopter.

67
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,570
Kidding.

68
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,930
Chuck... what a waste of time that was.

69
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,430
You know, it's not a real relationship

70
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,900
If you can't hold hands.

71
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,400
Oh, but Nate is good to me. 
Good for me.

72
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,830
And he's learned a thing or two.

73
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,540
So being a kept man does have its perks.

74
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,240
Yeah, but no man is worth suffering 
the indignity of mass transit.

75
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,580
How's the foreigner?

76
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,580
Blair, Gabriel is from North Carolina.

77
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,810
- That's in the United States. 
- Not by choice.

78
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,020
Let me remind you of a little thing 
called the Civil War.

79
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,480
Everything with Gabriel is perfect.

80
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,270
No strings, no demands...

81
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,460
Except he is so focused 
on building his new company

82
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,660
That he can never commit to anything--

83
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,500
Dinner reservations, movies.

84
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,240
Sometimes, he'll get a text for a meeting,

85
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,880
and then, poof, he's gone.

86
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,780
Well, if it's casual like you said

87
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,170
No strings... then what do you expect?

88
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,570
It's not like you're gonna marry the guy

89
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,890
I kinda did marry him.

90
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,990
We got carried away. 
I talked to Cyrus. It doesn't count

91
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,300
Let me get this straight.

92
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,460
He goads you into making 
the ultimate commitment,

93
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,420
And now he can't stick it out 
through a whole dinner?

94
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,680
He didn't goad me. It was... romantic.

95
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,740
Gabriel is disappearing for a reason.

96
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,720
- We need to get to the bottom of it. 
- No, we don't.

97
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,220
Oh, come on! Let's follow him tonight.

98
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,440
We can dress up, use code names.

99
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,080
Dorota is a great help 
with surveillance equipment.

100
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,450
Doesn't that sound at all fun?

101
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,060
No, not even a smidgen.

102
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,950
So what exactly are you guys doing tonight?

103
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,600
No.

104
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,340
Well, you suck more than usual today.

105
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,490
A little distracted.

106
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,160
Things with--

107
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,080
- It's okay.  You can say her name. 
- Blair.

108
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,430
I feel weird talking about her with you.

109
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,030
Nathaniel, she's your girlfriend.

110
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,400
If we want to be friends like we were,

111
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,630
It's just part of the deal.

112
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,430
So it's okay to just talk 
about her guy to guy

113
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,490
Like we used to?

114
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,950
Well, I was there for you 
last week, wasn't it?

115
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,100
Yeah, you were. I think 
next year's gonna be harder

116
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,010
than I thought, you know, 
with me in morningside heights

117
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,190
and her all the way down in the Village,

118
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,120
It's basically like we're in 
a long-distance relationship.

119
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,420
Well, it's too bad you don't have a place

120
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,270
In the middle, like my room at the palace.

121
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,060
Just say a word, and she can crash with me.

122
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,000
That's not funny.

123
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,050
You're right. I'm sorry.

124
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,710
But, Archibald, let's face it:

125
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,310
You won. I lost.

126
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,540
You have nothing to worry about with me.

127
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,450
I'm out of that game.

128
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,430
Well, I certainly don't have to worry

129
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,730
about your weak-ass jumper, do I?

130
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,870
And then my grandfather says,

131
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,270
"If it's menthol you want, 
it's menthol you're gonna get."

132
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,320
I didn't know your family 
was in the tobacco industry.

133
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,130
Yeah, they are.

134
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,130
But Gabriel doesn't want 
anything to do with it.

135
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,620
They were grooming me to take over,

136
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,130
But I had to break out on my own 
and do something positive.

137
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,860
So I started researching new technologies

138
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,230
And found a company that wants 
to provide wireless access

139
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,320
to the developing world, 
so I've been backing them.

140
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,700
I mean, it sounds like such a good thing,

141
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,200
But to my family, it is betrayal.

142
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,540
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that

143
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,110
Family is so important.

144
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,560
Oh, excuse me. 
Oh, I asked the caterer

145
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,400
for a '99 Brunello. 
This isn't a PTA meeting.

146
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,660
Though nothing's as important 
as the right wine.

147
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,350
Look, I apologize. I'm hosting 
the co-op meeting tomorrow,

148
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,930
And it'll be an hour-long battle 
over lobby renovations,

149
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,600
Followed by cocktails and appetizers.

150
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,270
You're welcome to join us. 
Keep Serena company.

151
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,830
Oh, yes, please do.

152
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,710
- I'd be honored. 
- Hey, who's up for a movie?

153
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,540
Yeah. Yes.

154
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,330
Do you know what? 
That sounds lovely, but...

155
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,410
I'm sorry, honey. I have some work to do.

156
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,130
So... this has been great, 
thank you very much.

157
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,060
But I'm afraid I have to go.

158
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,300
Gabriel, it's a movie.

159
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,730
You know, most of 'em are only, 
like, 80 minutes these days.

160
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,160
And you know that there's 
nothing else I'd rather do,

161
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,720
But I'm a little behind 
on reviewing the prospectus.

162
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,600
This is important to me.

163
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,420
Yeah, and you spending time with my family

164
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,260
- Is important to me. 
- My deal will be closed soon,

165
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,930
And then I'm all yours, I promise.

166
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,030
I'll see you tomorrow.

167
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,180
I'll get my coat.


169
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:21,700
Blair.

170
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,670
I see you're wearing your beret.

171
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,160
Who are we spying on tonight?

172
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,720
Serena's shady southerner.

173
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,410
Well, I can't say he does much for me, either.

174
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,230
But why the intrigue? Don't tell me...

175
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,030
Not enough drama in 
domestic bliss with Nate?

176
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,510
You know, when people step outside 
their relationship for a thrill

177
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,000
It's usually not alone and in the dark.

178
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,900
I happen to be worried 
about my best friend.

179
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,010
Serena said Gabriel 
just disappears. Poof!

180
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,080
Well, I'm gonna find out 
where he's poofing to.

181
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,640
And besides, it's good for couples 
to have different interests.

182
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,680
This feels eerily familiar.

183
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,150
Shut up!

184
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:06,900
Look.

185
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,670
Poppy?

186
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,100
And when a queen 
discovers her best maiden

187
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,290
is with a dragon in disguise...

188
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,170
The only thing to do is pull up 
the drawbridge and trap him.

189
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,870
Metaphorically, of course.

190
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,810
You have to dump him!

191
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,640
We caught that redneck red-handed.

192
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,540
Well, B., obviously I'm not thrilled,

193
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,760
But I'm gonna get to the 
bottom of this on my own.

194
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:30,770
Now why can't you worry

195
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,070
about your own relationship
 problems for a change?

196
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,970
- What does that supposed to mean? 
- It was friday night,

197
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,930
And you were out spying on my boyfriend,

198
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,290
Instead of seeing a movie or something.

199
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:43,100
Why can't anybody see a movie around here?

200
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,020
I have to call you later.

201
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,230
Serena, there's something you should know.

202
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,360
Last night I was...

203
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,510
Spying on that boyfriend 
of Serena's. Philanderer!

204
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,600
- Chuck and I saw him with Poppy. 
- Wait. Chuck?

205
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,710
You were with Chuck?

206
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,520
Yeah, we ran into each other 
outside the building.

207
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,830
It's not a big deal. 
You know that, right?

208
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,800
Yeah. of course. It's no big deal.

209
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,890
Good, because unlike some 
people we know... Serena...

210
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,030
We have a relationship 
without secrets or lying.

211
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,130
Yeah, I know.

212
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,050
We're really lucky.

213
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,700
- Good. Ready to go have lunch? 
- Sure.

214
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,420
Are you sleeping with her?

215
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,060
No. No.

216
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,120
Not since I met you.

217
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,770
I told her that I just needed space

218
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,120
And time to think.

219
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,120
But the truth is, I--

220
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,460
I'd just like to never see her again.

221
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,140
You know, when I first came to New York,

222
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,400
I didn't know many people.

223
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,880
And all the investors in 
my company are her contacts.

224
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,110
And when she found out about us,

225
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,590
she threatened to pull them

226
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,230
So I told her that you and I were over.

227
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,230
If she found out the truth...

228
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,280
I could lose-- 
I could lose everything.

229
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,280
Do you hate me?

230
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,060
No, I don't hate you.

231
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,660
But I hate lying.

232
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,100
And you lied to me.

233
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,710
And you lied to Poppy

234
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,220
despite everything she is still my friend

235
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,250
and I care about her

236
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,110
I didn't plan on falling love with you

237
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,550
Gabriel, you--you have to tell her about us.

238
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,410
I can't.

239
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,730
You know how jealous she is.

240
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,750
And I've spent two years 
developing this company.

241
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,070
It's-- it's everything to me.

242
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,780
It's finallty the chance 
to be free from my parents.

243
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,350
By tying yourself to Poppy?

244
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,040
I've done the 2-girlfriends thing.

245
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,080
I can't do that again.

246
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,340
Listen, these contracts 
will be done in one week.

247
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,870
And after that, I promise you
I will tell her everything.

248
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,000
Trust me. The money she'll make, 
it'll cushion the blow.

249
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,750
As long as it's not physical,

250
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,640
Then I...

251
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,490
I guess I can live with it.

252
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,430
But only for a week. I mean it.

253
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:10,990
Okay.

254
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,790
Believe me,

255
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,620
I only have eyes for one girl.

256
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:23,260
And she is the most 
exquisite thing I've ever seen.

257
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,630
So am I not supposed to mention the outfit?

258
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,900
I'm a cater waiter now. 
Where've you been?

259
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,930
Just... working.

260
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,050
Okay. Well, I was hoping 
to never speak about this,

261
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,500
But it might actually feel good to.

262
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,720
Oh, hey, there you guys are.

263
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,310
So have you told her about the ring yet?

264
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,280
Ring? What ring?

265
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,220
We caught our dad eyeing one yesterday.

266
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,050
A ring ring?

267
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,880
Oh, my god. Wait. 
This is good news, right?

268
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,630
Well, I mean, he--
he looked. He didn't buy.

269
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,610
He chickened out. Why?

270
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,290
Maybe because Jenny basically told him

271
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,180
she'd never move in with the V.D. dubs.

272
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,720
Okay, or he's worried about Dan having slept

273
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,640
- With his maybe stepsister. 
- Well, I hope that's not it,

274
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,040
'cause there's really zero chance

275
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,400
of Serena and I ever getting back together.

276
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,600
So you guys are okay with it.

277
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,040
Yeah, well, it'd be weird-- 
dad marrying Lily.

278
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,535
Sharing bunk beds with Chuck. 

279
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,470
Yeah, I mean, it would defenitely be weird.

280
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,520
But, I don't know, 
you should've seen dad yesterday.

281
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,900
I mean, he was practically skipping.

282
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,090
I don't think I've ever seen him this happy.

283
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,770
I don't think I've ever seen anyone that happy.

284
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,340
Then you should tell him you support him.

285
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,450
No, that's not-- that can't be right.

286
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,130
That's not what we dis-discussed it.

287
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:39,940
- That's, uh... 
- Dad?

288
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,340
Uh, no. No, no, no. I won't hav...

289
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,390
Though maybe not today.

290
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,970
Let me get this straight.

291
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,990
Gabriel is still popping Poppy,

292
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,410
And you're okay with that?

293
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,760
No, no, this is too m.o.b.

294
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,820
Go put on the Vena Cava.

295
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,900
For the hundredth time,

296
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,480
He's not still sleeping with her.

297
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,100
And while it's not ideal,

298
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,890
He is gonna break up with her next week.

299
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,600
And what proof did he offer of that?

300
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,880
He doesn't need proof, B.,

301
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,330
Because I trust him.

302
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,390
We have this amazing connection.

303
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,190
Do you know he said 
he fell in love with me

304
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,420
the first time he ever saw me?

305
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,430
Oh, that is interesting, considering the fact

306
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,430
That he was on vacation with his girlfriend.

307
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,300
Actually, the first time 
he saw me was a year ago

308
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,520
When I was out with Georgina.

309
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,900
He busted me on my fake southern accent

310
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,120
And what night was that?

311
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,660
Don't tell me it was that night--

312
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,360
That night that you blacked out

313
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,610
and don't remember anything?

314
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,540
He fell in love with you 
while you were roofied.

315
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,640
How romantic.

316
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,390
No, no, no. It wasn't like that.

317
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,980
He said I was completely lucid.

318
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,920
It must've been before Georgina drugged me.

319
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,310
I just don't happen to remember it.

320
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,940
Believe me, I had to learn the hard way.

321
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,560
Trust is the most important thing 
in a relationship

322
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,840
and we have that

323
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,130
The way I trust Nate and he trusts me?

324
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,040
Even though he may as well be 
going  to school in Guam next year

325
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,760
I wouldn't worry if I can't find him

326
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:03,760
Because I know he'll always be true to me.

327
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,050
I hope so, B.

328
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,420
Because, no offense, but we both know that

329
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,910
that hasn't always been the case.

330
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,310
What are you saying,
that Nate is in love with you?

331
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,920
What are you saying, that Gabriel isn't?

332
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,060
No. I'm just saying he's not 
gonna break up with Poppy.

333
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,250
Why would he? He's having her cake

334
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,110
and eating yours, too

335
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,150
Ok, right, so both Nate and Chuck 
are obsessed with you,

336
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,850
But my boyfriend can't stay faithful

337
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:26,640
- To me for seven days?
- No, that's...

338
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,650
I love you.

339
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,360
I just don't want to see you get hurt, okay?

340
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,430
Go put that back on.

341
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,550
It was beautiful on you.

342
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,010
Oh, Vanessa. I thought 
you left with Dan and Jenny.

343
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,200
I was just about to close up.

344
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,380
You-- you can go home now.

345
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,990
Figure I'll savor my moments here while I can.

346
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,950
Gonna miss this place.

347
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,740
Yeah, well, it, uh, looks like 
your job will be safe

348
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,390
- For quite a while. 
- What do you mean?

349
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,970
The real estate agent hasn't received one call

350
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,970
about the place. She thinks 
it might be months before

351
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,030
we find a buyer. It's the market.

352
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,860
That's why you were so upset earlier.

353
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,090
Is there a plan "B"?

354
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,520
Yeah, last year, after the tour,

355
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,090
a music publishing company offered to buy

356
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,510
The Lincoln Hawk catalog.

357
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,320
You're gonna sell your life's work?

358
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,870
Yes.

359
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,190
And, apparently, now that we're not touring,

360
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,550
it isn't even worth what it was last year.

361
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:41,560
You know, I stopped touring 
to spend time with my family.

362
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,250
It turns out it might've been the worst thing

363
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,610
I could've done for them.

364
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,860
I'm sorry. This isn't your burden.

365
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:57,980
Hey, let's get outta here.

366
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,450
Archibald, what are we doing here?

367
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,420
This place is great, but Murray Hill?

368
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,950
Even your mother's too hip for this zip code.

369
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,330
It's for me.

370
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,830
It's halfway between NYU and Columbia.

371
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,030
I just figured I'd lease this

372
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,540
so I could be close to Blair next year.

373
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,270
Well, congratulations, but couldn't you

374
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,910
have told me this over the phone?

375
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,750
You're my friend, all right?

376
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,130
I brought you here as my friend.

377
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,680
To show you I found a solution to my problem.

378
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,890
Okay, friend.
I hope you'll be very happy here.

379
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,850
I just wanted to show you

380
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,050
that Blair and I are really serious now.

381
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,670
You understand that, right?

382
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,800
She told you about our little run-in last night.

383
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,150
You told me you'd back off.

384
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,440
I did and will continue to do so.

385
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,640
Last night was nothing.

386
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,420
We ran into each other on the street.

387
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,180
It was no big deal.

388
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,760
With you two, it's always a big deal.

389
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,910
We just have to be clear with each other.

390
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,370
I want you to know that 
Blair and I are in a good place.

391
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,370
What place is that?

392
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,750
Some tacky apartment where 
you can keep your eye on her?

393
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,620
No, that's not the reason I got--

394
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,150
If you needed to mark your 
territory so badly, Nathaniel,

395
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,560
Maybe you should just pee on her.

396
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,180
I don't want you to go near her again

397
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,400
I mean that.

398
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,540
It's Blair.

399
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,380
I think I'll take this one outside.

400
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,890
I thought if I proved the North Caro-liar

401
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,650
Was cheating with his ex, that would be it,

402
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,390
But she fell for his business meeting excuse.

403
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,020
Monkey business, more likely.

404
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,200
With Serena and Poppy 
both fighting over the banana.

405
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,100
I'm really worried, Chuck.

406
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,880
You know how Serena is.

407
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,190
she gets in over her head.

408
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,160
We need to expose this two-timer for what he is.

409
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,410
So what do you say, Bass?

410
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,660
One last mission?

411
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,450
By any chance, do you have 
Poppy Lifton's phone number?

412
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,490
Queen of hearts or queen of heartache?

413
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,400
Careful, B.,

414
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,560
Cut off the head of one love triangle,

415
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,390
One of your own may grow back in its place.

416
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,240
And that concludes our co-op business at this time

417
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,670
And now the real reason 
you came, the refreshments

418
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:24,010
you and I simply have not had time to bond

419
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,490
Come, we'll walk

420
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,270
Blair where are we going?

421
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,060
- On a tour.
- Of my house?

422
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,670
I've been here before.

423
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,720
First, we'll start with Serena's room.

424
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,790
While I appreciate you playing 
the peacemaker, Chuck,

425
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,430
I'm not sure Serena will want to see me.

426
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,700
Trust me, this should be exciting for everyone.

427
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,010
And this is serena's dresser

428
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,390
Where she keeps all her pajamas and peignoirs.

429
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,800
But maybe you've already been in there.

430
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,960
Blair, what are you doing?

431
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,970
Poppy. Gabriel.

432
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,910
Nice. I knew it.

433
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,020
Poppy, I know. we-- we need to talk.

434
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,130
What do you want to talk about?

435
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,410
The fact that you stole my boyfriend?

436
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,330
I didn't steal him. You left

437
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,310
You know what? Don't.

438
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,290
'Cause it's not even you 
that I'm mad at. It's him.

439
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:18,110
You are a lying, cheating-- 
I am gonna kill you!

440
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,930
No one's killing anyone. 
It's a co-op cocktail party.

441
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,450
What an idiot I am!

442
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,270
Using my connections for your company?

443
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,920
Poppy, it is not like that.

444
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,060
You know it's not.

445
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,120
Then leave with me right now.

446
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,310
And if you don't, 
I will call every investor

447
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,930
And tell them to take their money back.

448
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,720
Poppy, you and I are done.

449
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,320
Things haven't been good 
with us for a long time.

450
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,480
And I'm sorry.

451
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,030
Serena didn't steal me.

452
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,520
She swept me away.

453
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,360
You tell your investors whatever you want.

454
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,690
Fine.

455
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,270
I'll tell them the truth.

456
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,440
That you're ruined.

457
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,500
Goodbye, Gabriel

458
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,930
Gabriel...

459
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,960
I'm sorry. I just... 
I need a minute to clear my head.

460
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,120
I guess he really likes you.

461
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,480
- At least now we know. 
- I'll deal with you later.

462
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,650
Hello.

463
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,460
Since when did my apartment

464
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,790
become your watering hole of choice?

465
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,500
Rufus and Jenny let me in on their way out.

466
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,730
I thought I'd wait for you,

467
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,990
Maybe play a little "I never."

468
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,940
I kind of already started.

469
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,760
Yeah, I can see that.

470
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,550
- I'll go first.  
- All right.

471
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,670
I never slept with Chuck Bass.

472
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,860
That's why I've been avoiding you.

473
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,140
I know. It's repulsive.

474
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,490
It is...

475
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,030
Completely repulsive, but you didn't--

476
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,820
But you--you--you--you've been 
going through a lot lately.

477
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,610
I mean, the whole 
Blair-Nate reunion and all, and

478
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,320
Plus the whole 
"looking up while looking down" thing

479
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,480
Really had a certain appeal to it.

480
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,070
So you--you get no judgment from me.

481
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,610
Everyone makes a mistake at least once.

482
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,480
I never... nearly slept with Georgina Sparks.

483
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,990
I never slept with Chuck Bass twice.

484
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,920
Dan, you're lucky.

485
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,560
However bad your life sucks right now,

486
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,920
You didn't need an STD panel this week.

487
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,280
Oh, yeah, there's that.

488
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,590
Wait, why does my life suck right now?

489
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,390
So you going to Lily's now?

490
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,120
Yeah, the co-op meeting should be done by now.

491
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,620
There's a party after. You should come.

492
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,130
No offense. That sounds really boring,

493
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,820
Especially with Eric being out of town.

494
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,640
So, uh...

495
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,660
You kinda haven't been yourself tonight.

496
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,500
All day, actually.

497
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,640
I mean, is everything all right?

498
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,270
I'm just a little tired, but I'm fine.

499
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,850
You're not.

500
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,200
And I know why.

501
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,220
Jenny, whatever you think you know--

502
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,170
I know that you want to propose to Lily.

503
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,140
And I want you to know that

504
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,930
Dan and I are totally okay with it.

505
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,170
But you have to let me make 
the bridesmaid dresses, okay?

506
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,810
I think those bridesmaid 
dresses are a bit premature.

507
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,220
Why? Dan saw you looking 
at that ring yesterday.

508
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,170
It's not a good time. 
There are some, uh,

509
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,070
Complicated things happening right now.

510
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,600
Well, whatever they are, you can fix them.

511
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,930
You just have to want it bad enough.

512
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,490
Dad, my whole life, you said 
that I could do anything

513
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,390
If I was willing to risk 
falling flat on my face.

514
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,330
So why doesn't that same advice apply to you?

515
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,750
- Right? 
- Good point.

516
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,340
And you know I'm right.

517
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:11,930
I gotta go.

518
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,630
So I'm really glad you chose me over money.

519
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,400
I never really had a choice.

520
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,110
I'm just glad everything's in the open.

521
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,440
I'll go back to North Carolina 
and work with my father.

522
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,200
Maybe he'll let me design 
a public service campaign.

523
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,090
Oh. I'm sorry. I know how 
hard you've been working.

524
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,350
Well, you shouldn't be.

525
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,700
I 100% brought this on myself.

526
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,740
I could have really made 
a difference with this company.

527
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,880
And I have to admit,

528
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:42,090
I wanted to rub that money 
in my father's face.

529
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,400
It was that good of a deal, huh?

530
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,080
Poppy's investors would 
have tripled their money

531
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,990
by the end of summer.

532
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,610
Well, then you have to still do it.

533
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,290
Come on, without you,

534
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,710
How else will all of the African teenagers

535
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,170
Send in posts to "Gossip Girl"?

536
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,500
Poppy was serious about 
calling off her investors.

537
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,800
Well, then find new ones. 
Look around. These are residents

538
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,630
of one of the wealthiest co-ops 
in Manhattan, and smartest.

539
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,830
Our board rejected 
Bernie Madoff five years in a row.

540
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,650
I thought we found out today

541
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,330
Was a mistake mixing 
business and pleasure.

542
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:14,110
Please. I would be so proud to help you.

543
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,320
- Really? You sure? 
- Yes, of course.

544
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,060
- Let me go find my mom. 
- Okay.

545
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,650
Gabriel.

546
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,780
The martinis are great, right?

547
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,360
So I heard you, uh, first met Serena

548
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,420
On one of her infamous nights with Georgina.

549
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,570
You know, I've always wanted 
to know what happened.

550
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,310
It must be quite a story.

551
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,690
Oh, Nate, what are you doing here?

552
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,960
I thought there was a Mets game.

553
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,640
I saw Dorota wearing her hat.

554
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,740
Yeah, I can just catch the 
highlights on "Sportscenter."

555
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,680
I wanted to surprise you.

556
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,930
- Are Chuck and Serena here? 
- Somewhere.

557
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,250
I can't believe I let him talk me into

558
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,520
operation 'gone with the weasel'.

559
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,130
It's a long story and unimportant.

560
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,950
What matters is how glad 
I am you surprised me.

561
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,370
Good. I'm not done.

562
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,390
I know you're nervous about 
us being far apart next year,

563
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,370
So I got something.

564
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,170
- It's a one-bedroom in Murray Hill. 
- Oh, my god.

565
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,790
Will you move in with me?

566
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,200
- Yes. 
- Yeah?

567
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,840
Yes, of course I will.

568
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,940
You're moving in?

569
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,440
Yes, she is. I'm taking her 
there now, actually.

570
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,970
Well, before you birds 
fly off to your love nest,

571
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,490
There's something you should know.

572
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,100
Gabriel says he met Serena 
the night before the SATs.

573
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,380
He said they were at Butter.

574
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,610
No, that's impossible.

575
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,520
I know. We should go tell Serena.

576
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,280
No, no, no. Chuck can 
handle this by himself.

577
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,610
Why don't we go see our apartment?

578
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,570
Sometimes a queen has to make a choice.

579
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:59,000
A castle with a white knight,
or a quest with a dark prince.

580
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,060
So, B., what'll it be?

581
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,310
Netflix night with Nate 
or battling a beast with Bass?

582
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,220
The governments, the ISPs,

583
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,690
and the big companies 
need to use these satellites.

584
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,200
We could be the only game in town.

585
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,070
And it has a charitable component too.

586
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:17,380
Free wireless access for all 
local schools and community groups.

587
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,910
Well, this is just the sort of thing

588
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,120
that some of us at Bass 
have been pushing for.

589
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,680
Doing well by doing good.

590
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,620
Yes. But the only thing is 
there's a ticking clock.

591
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,820
Some of the major internet corporations

592
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,270
are pushing to do a similar thing.

593
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,590
If we act now, we block them completely.

594
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,160
And we make at least triple our investment.

595
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,700
Ok, Gabriel, why don't you send 
a prospectus to my assistant?

596
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,920
Of course I have to look at it,

597
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,710
But, um, you can tell your backers I'm in.

598
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,990
You were great! 
Now all you have to do is

599
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,210
Tell the rest of the co-op 
members that she invested,

600
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,400
And with my mom's approval, you are golden.

601
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,440
Serena, I need to see you in your room.

602
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,210
Another tour?

603
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,900
He's lying to you.

604
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,770
Seriously, you two, enough.

605
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,760
He told Chuck that he met you at Butter,

606
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,310
But I know for a fact that 
Butter was closed that night

607
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,760
because I used their bartender

608
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,770
for the Nelly Yuki SAT sabotage party!

609
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,160
Not that I need to explain 
this to either of you,

610
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,800
But I was with Georgina that night,

611
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,100
and she knows the manager.

612
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,010
So it was probably a private party.

613
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,740
Or he just misremembered.

614
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,550
Well, Chuck also saw him 
making a secretive phone call.

615
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,780
Oh, wow. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

616
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,120
The smoking gun,
a secretive phone call.

617
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,480
Blair, I support you in all of 
your crazy choices, case in point.

618
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,350
Why can't you show me the same respect?

619
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,650
Gabriel is a good guy. 
He's trustworthy.

620
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,700
Even my mom trusts him,

621
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,000
Or she wouldn't have invested 
in his project just now.

622
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,950
Just face it, you two.

623
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,230
You're using this as an 
excuse to get together again.

624
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,740
I'm going back to my boyfriend now.

625
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,580
If you know what's good for you, 
you'll go back to yours.

626
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,280
Butter? Really?

627
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:04,350
It does sound kinda stupid 
when you say it out loud.

628
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,840
There's only one person 
who knows what really happened

629
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,430
that night Gabriel supposedly met Serena.

630
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,110
Wow. I'm not going to Yale.

631
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,150
I'm so sorry I let it out like that.

632
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,900
But maybe this way it'll be 
a little easier on Rufus.

633
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,880
Having to tell you would have killed him.

634
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,280
- Yeah, I know. 
- You don't blame him, do you?

635
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,990
I blame the financial aid office

636
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,880
And... the recession.

637
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,780
And...

638
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:51,080
A certain imbecile former president.

639
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,300
My dad has gotta be the 
only person in the world

640
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,130
who's more upset about this news than me.

641
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,510
He was so excited about...

642
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,750
Selling the gallery and moving on.

643
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,550
Do you think he'll still propose?

644
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,780
He's got a lot of pride.

645
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,100
I'll write you a check right now.

646
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,570
- I look forward to working with you, Gabriel. 
- Absolutely.

647
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,920
Gabriel, can I speak to you for a moment?

648
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,240
Yeah, of course. 
Excuse me.

649
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,840
I'd like to invest as well.

650
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,490
And as much as I appreciate your support,

651
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,390
There are other investments

652
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,990
better suited for someone in your situation--

653
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,440
Municipal bonds, mutual funds.

654
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,890
I'd be happy to show you how to set something--

655
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,260
I know how to open a mutual fund.

656
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,820
I don't appreciate being patronized.

657
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,660
Oh, no, no, that wasn't my intention. 
I apologize.

658
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,510
My money is just as good as anyone else's.

659
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,290
It's how the game works, isn't it?

660
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:53,210
Opportunity arises in the 
private rooms of restaurants

661
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,600
and on exclusive golf courses, 
and the rich get richer,

662
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,160
and the guys in the middle are never there.

663
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,370
Well, I'm right here. I want in.

664
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,200
I need to see the apartment tomorrow.

665
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,390
- There's something I have to do now. 
- With Chuck?

666
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,890
Serena didn't believe us.

667
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,760
You mean she didn't just dump her boyfriend

668
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,820
'cause you two told her to?

669
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,610
What's wrong with her

670
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,780
No, I'm not going. Neither should you.

671
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,540
- I mean, it's just Chuck playing games. 
- I don't think it is,

672
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,070
And if you don't want to come with us,

673
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:30,270
Then please, just let me go. 
I need you to trust me.

674
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,850
The limo's waiting.

675
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,360
You're right.

676
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,330
I need to trust you, and I do, so...

677
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,930
Go.

678
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,600
You should call Eleanor. 
We won't be back tonight.

679
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,910
Wait. What? I thought she 
was back home in Connecticut.

680
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,320
You thought wrong. 
Yes. Hello.

681
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,370
What time are your visiting hours?

682
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,290
We're coming to see Georgina Sparks.

683
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,290
Get out your brooms, kids.

684
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,430
We're off to see

685
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,900
the Wicked Witch 
of the Upper East Side.

686
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,360
Mr. Bass?

687
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,890
Visiting hours have started.

688
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,290
I can't believe I have 
to see my sworn enemy

689
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,070
With Nancy Pelosi hair.

690
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,070
Now that you mention it,

691
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,650
Maybe it's best if I go in alone.

692
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,930
What?

693
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,020
You just said it. 
You're enemies.

694
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,250
- Why would she help you? 
- Because I'm gonna threaten

695
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,960
to send her back to 
boot camp if she doesn't.

696
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,140
Blair, Georgina and I go way back.

697
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,250
We have a special bond.

698
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,250
I'll handle this one.

699
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,320
You didn't even need me here.

700
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,150
You just wanted to get me alone,

701
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,480
away from Nate,

702
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,640
away from our first night in our apartment.

703
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:20,160
And his motives were pure, of course.

704
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,940
I'm sure it's a simple coincidence

705
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,330
that he asked you to move in
 right when you and I

706
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,260
began speaking again.

707
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,970
He asked me so I wouldn't have 
to take the subway next year.

708
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,050
That's maybe why he got 
the lease on the place.

709
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:33,110
But asking you to move in 
was for my benefit.

710
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,260
Ask him yourself. 
Or you could just trust him.

711
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,080
Still, the fact remains.

712
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,840
You chose to spend a night 
in a car with me

713
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,260
Over a night in your 
honeymoon suite with Nate.

714
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,110
But then again, we all 
knew your weakness for limos.

715
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,020
I came here for my best friend.

716
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,500
Is that the only reason?

717
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,630
What is this place?

718
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,950
Welcome. Are you a wayward soul 
in serching of direction?

719
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,590
- I think I'm in the wrong place.
- Chuck Bass?

720
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,610
Have you been saved, too?

721
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:34,120
Blair was so wrong about you.

722
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,840
What do you mean?

723
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,850
I didn't want to make you feel bad,

724
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:41,480
But she and Chuck have this 
weird vendetta against you.

725
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:45,730
Some nonsense about Butter 
being closed that night.

726
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,790
That's ridiculous.

727
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,570
If she would have heard

728
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,950
"Savannah's" terrible 
southern accent that night...

729
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,630
She'd have a vendetta 
against you instead of me.

730
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:57,270
So what'd you think of Georgina anyway?

731
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,960
She didn't make that much of impression.

732
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,820
Not even her hair?

733
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,100
That flaming red?

734
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,750
I mean...

735
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,370
I swear her colorist is masochistic.

736
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,640
I mean, of course I remember that.

737
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,530
But who cares?

738
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,150
If you'd met you that night,

739
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,530
You'd forget everything else, too.

740
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,360
I should, uh,

741
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,770
I should go home before my mom wakes up.

742
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:40,890
It's a 7-day session all about forgiveness,

743
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:42,880
And at the end of it, 
we put on a passion play.

744
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,530
You're more than welcome to come with me.

745
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,830
I have to supervise the kids

746
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,870
making paper mashall puzzles for the set.

747
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,030
It's, brilliant.

748
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,950
Oh, it's not that hard. 
It's just sd flour and paste.

749
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:55,190
Getting these Jesus freaks 
to believe you're one of them

750
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,950
So you don't have 
to go back to boot camp?

751
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,760
Still the same old Chuck.

752
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,490
Why can't you believe that people can change?

753
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,100
Oh, people can change, but you?

754
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,180
You're wrong, Chuck.

755
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,250
You know, as bad as boot camp was,

756
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,260
it really gave me time to think

757
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,540
about the person I'd become.

758
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,920
Scheming, manipulative.

759
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,810
It sickened me.

760
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,820
So one day I decided 
to do something about it.

761
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,290
I went to church, found Jesus

762
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,950
And I told him all my sins. 

763
00:35:22,952 --> 00:35:24,450
Well, I bet that was a long talk.

764
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,030
He forgave me.

765
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,650
Look, I know it seems crazy, but...

766
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,780
For the first time in my life,

767
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,760
I'm--I'm happy.

768
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,050
But if I know Chuck Bass, 
you're not here to be reformed.

769
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:42,560
I came to ask if you know a man 
named Gabriel Edwards.

770
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,820
I don't think so. Why?

771
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,980
He claims he met you at Butter

772
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,680
that night you roofied Serena.

773
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,400
Ooh. yeah, I've been praying 
overtime for that one.

774
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:56,480
But... that's impossible.

775
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,010
We never went to Butter.

776
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,980
We were back in my hotel 
by midnight, watching "The Hills"

777
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,490
as Serena drooled on my shoulder.

778
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,340
- Did you forget something? 
- Yes!

779
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,940
To thank you for your 
amazing performance last night.

780
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,640
I think we're a good team.

781
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,570
You and Blair were right about Gabriel.

782
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,440
He's lying about meeting me that night. 
I don't know why.

783
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,580
Yeah, I know. Look, hang tight.

784
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,560
- Blair and I will be there as soon as we can. 
- Okay.

785
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:35,970
Actually...

786
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,540
Since my limo's gone, that might be a while.

787
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,310
And eventually a queen realizes

788
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:44,640
that a dark prince only has 
one thing on his mind,

789
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,370
And it ain't slaying dragons.

790
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,460
So she takes her pumpkin carriage

791
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,130
and goes back to the castle.

792
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,250
With all these investments from the party,

793
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,660
We should have everything we need 
by the end of the month.

794
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,830
You know I thought we were screwed 
when Chuck Bass called me,

795
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,340
But you found a way to make it work,

796
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,670
And when you chose being poor 
and being with Serena...

797
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,050
She left me a message.

798
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,990
She's awfully needy, isn't she

799
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,610
Hey, Gabriel. It's me.

800
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:19,340
Listen I'm coming back to 
your hotel. We have to talk.

801
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,350
Don't go anywhere. 
I'll see you soon.

802
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,040
She sounds nervous.

803
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,770
Yeah, she does.

804
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,910
Well, why would she be? 
Did something happen?

805
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,830
No, it's more like something 
that didn't happen.

806
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,530
You doing your research properly.

807
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:34,060
She told me this morning 
that Butter was closed

808
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,540
the night that I allegedly met her there.

809
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,490
And what the hell is Butter?

810
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,230
We gotta get out of here, fast.

811
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,830
Just don't answer it.

812
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,480
Okay, it's--it's fine. 
I can handle this.

813
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,000
Rufus.

814
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,460
I just wanted to bring you 
my check in person.

815
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,220
I made a mistake.

816
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,690
I shouldn't have gone with Chuck.

817
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,300
Oh, it's okay.

818
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,850
I'm just glad you came back.

819
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,750
Well, come in. 
Let me show you around.

820
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:30,620
You know...

821
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,090
I loathe Murray Hill.

822
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,980
Why did you get this apartment?

823
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,090
I got it so we wouldn't 
be so far apart next year.

824
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,580
And is that also why you 
asked me to move in with you?

825
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:48,360
Blair. Knowing you and Chuck 
were hanging out made me jealous.

826
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,020
You said that you trusted me,

827
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,370
But you really don't, do you?

828
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,590
Blair...

829
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,160
I'm so sorry.

830
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,330
I love you.

831
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,700
So take your coat off and stay. Please.

832
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,990
- It's serena. 
- Ooh! Say hi for me.

833
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,900
I have so much love 
in my heart for that girl.

834
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,190
- Did you find him? 
- No, I'm too late.

835
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,400
What do you mean, you're too late?

836
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,380
I mean the drawers and closets are empty.

837
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,390
- He's gone. 
- what do you mean, gone?

838
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,680
I have to call you back.

839
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,530
He can't be gone. 
I need to talk to him.

840
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,540
I gave him half a million dollars.

841
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:50,670
Hey, Dan.

842
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,690
Oh. oh, coffee. Thank you, dad.

843
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,760
If you're here to deliver 
the bad news, it's okay.

844
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,370
I already know about Yale. 
Actually, that's, uh--

845
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:07,520
I don't know I was--was 
so set on going there anyway.

846
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,380
I mean, it's basically 
a big version of St. Jude's.

847
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,970
- We all know how well I fit in there. 
- Well, Dan--

848
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,640
I got accepted into a lot 
of other great schools,

849
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,030
A couple-- a couple of great schools.

850
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,890
NYU. They offer financial aid. 
I can always live at home.

851
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,240
Or at our new home.

852
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,030
- New home? 
- Yeah, we got you a little somethin'.

853
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,730
We pooled our savings.

854
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:30,510
Fortunately, your tastes are very modest.

855
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,980
This is an amazing gesture.

856
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,660
Well, we want you to be happy, dad.

857
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,060
And whatever you and Lily mean for us,

858
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,870
I mean, you know, we'll--we'll figure

859
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:45,620
You kids are an inspiration.

860
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:50,540
But I insist on writing you a check,

861
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,240
'cause there are certain things 
a man has to do on his own.

862
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,170
Oh, thank god. Thank god. Yeah,

863
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,370
We were hoping that you will say that.

864
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,470
The reason I came here was not 
to deliver bad news but good,

865
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,700
And if things work out 
the way I hope they will,

866
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,970
Yale will be happening.

867
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,990
Load a lot of other 
good stuff for this family.

868
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,080
What happened to your limo?

869
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,980
Arthur won't answer his phone,

870
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,440
but I'm guessing Blair took it.

871
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,710
Blair? You came here with Blair?

872
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,560
You know what?

873
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,880
It's actually my day off, 
and I really miss the city.

874
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,980
Oh, dear queen, heed the words of a king.

875
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,830
Look like an angel, talk like an angel,

876
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,850
But the devil in disguise.
