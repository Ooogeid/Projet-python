I can't rule the n.y.u.
Masses from the upper east side.

4
00:00:08,316 --> 00:00:11,000
I need to spend time in the dorm
to establish myself as queen.

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,500
It's not constance, blair.

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,850
I'm glad you ***, ***anymore

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,096
'Cause you looked like one of the incredibles.

8
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:17,250
Oh, thanks a lot.

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,520
I don't want to be queen.

10
00:00:18,673 --> 00:00:21,000
For what it's worth, I choose you.

11
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,770
I'm rufus and lily's son.

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,000
I wanted to say good-bye before I left for boston.

13
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,400
You're not going to brown.

14
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,950
You're scared to tell your mom.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,485
Let me help you with this.

How have you never heard of olivia burke ?

35
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,758
Come on. I thought you lived in brooklyn, not a cave.

36
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:32,950
no, i-i think i have heard of her. She's, uh,

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,670
what, she's the star of those zombie pirate movies ?

38
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,190
vam-vampire knights.

39
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,450
Oh, that makes more sense.

40
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,670
No, that "endless knights" series has made,
like, a billion dollars.

41
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,570
It's king arthur with vampires. Are you serious right now ?

42
00:01:44,841 --> 00:01:47,988
No, she plays guinevere, but, like,
a hot, blood-sucking guinevere.

43
00:01:48,038 --> 00:01:50,590
being that i have no idea what she looks like,

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,800
I'll make sure to keep an eye out for her.
Hey, uh, one coffee, please.

45
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,630
sure.

46
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,430
Hey, man. I gotta run. I got a 10:00 class.

47
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,640
Um, don't forget to read my hawthorne paper.

48
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,570
-Yeah, that's right.I'll see you, man.
- Cool.

49
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:01,209
That's a buck 50.

50
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,500
oh, you know what ? I think i forgot my wallet.

51
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,400
Hold on. I think i got change in here.

52
00:02:05,904 --> 00:02:07,243
Hold on a second.

53
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,050
You know what ? Um, there you go.

54
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,050
No, no, no, no. You don't have to do that. Please.

55
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,063
Karma. It'll come back to me.

56
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:17,730
Okay. All right. Thank you. That's incredibly nice.

57
00:02:17,946 --> 00:02:19,210
You're welcome.

58
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,591
I'm dan.

59
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:23,294
I'm, uh, kate.

60
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:24,926
It's very nice to meet you, kate.

61
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,420
He's an overexaggerated smilodon with comical green hair.

62
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,360
- what ?
- Yeah.

63
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,990
Nonsense. Clearly battle cat is
a relative of the royal indian tiger.

64
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,488
- They look exactly alike. Have you even-
- no.

65
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:40,080
Excuse me. I'm looking for the masters of the universe society.

66
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,686
And you have found us.

67
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,103
No, I think you misheard.I said the "masters of the universe."

68
00:02:46,153 --> 00:02:48,590
It's a term used for wall streeters.

69
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:51,310
Not that I give two hoots about finance.

70
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,930
I just need to know that in this misbegotten corner of manhattan,

71
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,870
that wealth, ambition and moral laxity are alive and well.

72
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,240
Young lady, i said we are the masters of the universe--

73
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,480
A society dedicated to promulgating the philosophical

74
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:10,050
And political messages contained In
the 1981 to '83 cartoon featuring he-man.

75
00:03:10,428 --> 00:03:12,072
We also do role-playing.

76
00:03:12,718 --> 00:03:14,050
Oh, my god.

77
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:17,440
What are you doing ?
You don't tell a girl you do role-playing.

78
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,525
I love role-playing, all right ?

79
00:03:18,678 --> 00:03:20,100
Good morning, beautiful.

80
00:03:20,305 --> 00:03:21,540
N.y.u. is hell.

81
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,110
What do you expect from a place where the men wear sandals ?

82
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,620
Look, just be thankful georgina's visiting
her parents in connecticut for the week.

83
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,290
How can i rule over people i don't understand ?
It's hopeless.

84
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:36,740
You know, today is the first day of constance.

85
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:38,560
Do you remember ?

86
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,760
How you used to mortar and pestle all
those hopeful young spirits ?

87
00:03:42,036 --> 00:03:43,430
Look, the day will come.

88
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,080
It just takes time.

89
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,356
At least i know constance hasn't changed.

90
00:03:50,728 --> 00:03:53,041
Eric, constance is gonna be so different.

91
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:55,680
There's no more hierarchy, no more mean girls,

92
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,830
No one copying how the queen dresses.

93
00:03:58,075 --> 00:04:00,376
It's gonna be a new era of sunlight and fairness.

94
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:03,760
Yeah, i don't think that's what blair had in mind
when she picked you to be her successor.

95
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,530
Too bad. Oh, hey, when does, uh, jonathan get back
From his fencing camp in torino ?

96
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,770
Not till next month.

97
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:10,122
Jenny.

98
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:14,101
Oh, that's disturbing.

99
00:04:20,706 --> 00:04:23,870
Uh... Hi. Who are you ?

100
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,650
I'm carmen. This is celeste. That's jane.

101
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,930
We're here to make sure you get exactly what you want this year.

102
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,812
You're gonna rule the school with an iron fist.

103
00:04:33,188 --> 00:04:34,890
Okay, enough.Uh...

104
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,659
First, go wash your eyes,

105
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,483
And second, tell everyone i need to talk to them now.

106
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,504
Now.

107
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,814
So...A new era of sunlight and fairness ?

108
00:04:51,405 --> 00:04:52,340
Shut up.

109
00:04:52,673 --> 00:04:54,622
That is absolutely unacceptable.

110
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,320
Okay. Uh, no, i'm sorry.My mom would never hit the table like that.

111
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,950
She--she would put her fingers to her forehead and do that,

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,760
Like, "why are you doing this to me ?" thing.

113
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,569
Oh, right. I know it. This...

114
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,300
Yeah, perfect.

115
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,450
So again.

116
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,893
Okay, um...

117
00:05:11,338 --> 00:05:15,089
Mom, i have decided not to go to brown.

118
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:17,108
oh, serena.

119
00:05:18,658 --> 00:05:22,430
I...Please know that i've put a lot of thought into this.

120
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,230
What is it ?

121
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,270
I'm sorry. She--she would just only do--
do the forehead thing for a second,

122
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,610
then she would look to the side and
do these little head shakes, you know ?

123
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,400
Uh, serena, i appreciate your pointers,

124
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,730
But the purpose of this role-playing is to
get you ready to tell your mom about brown.

125
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,159
No, i know. I know. I-i'm just--

126
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,931
I'm really nervous about her coming back tomorrow,

127
00:05:43,435 --> 00:05:46,060
And--and when are you gonna tell her
about the whole scott drama ?

128
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,420
Uh, a-after she digests the fact that
her daughter's not going to college.

129
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,354
That's a lot to hit her with right away.

130
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:52,927
Now one more time.

131
00:05:53,294 --> 00:05:54,301
Mom.

132
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:55,423
Yes, dear.

133
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,220
You're here.

134
00:05:58,635 --> 00:05:59,520
Serena.

135
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,652
Lily.

136
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:04,810
Ohh. Oh, rufus !

137
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,455
Oh, my gosh.

138
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,250
It is so good to see you both.

139
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,842
You didn't tell us you were coming.

140
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,726
well, cece's feeling so much better,
So i thought i would surprise you.

141
00:06:19,248 --> 00:06:22,100
Serena, what are you doing here ?
Shouldn't you be at brown ?

142
00:06:26,175 --> 00:06:28,530
So i've been reading the course catalog again,

143
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,010
And everything just sounds so interesting,

144
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:35,360
Like cold war philosophy and the bible as literature,

145
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,780
The post-impressionist movement.
I want to take everything.

146
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,399
And you say you're from jersey ?

147
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,490
seriously, I had to convince a lot of people to let me come here.

148
00:06:43,644 --> 00:06:45,740
I'm determined to take advantage of it.

149
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,360
Well, you know what ? On behalf of everyone
at n.y.u., All of 'em--welcome.

150
00:06:49,585 --> 00:06:52,560
My stuff just got here. I gotta go move in.

151
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,910
Okay, well, how am i gonna pay you back for this ?

152
00:06:55,543 --> 00:06:56,900
Call it my treat.

153
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,300
It was really nice to meet you, dan.

154
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:01,175
It was nice meeting you, kate.

155
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,630
I know how much you want me to go,
But this is the right thing.

156
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,861
I was against it at first, but i think
there are benefits to serena deferring a year.

157
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,550
And i'm gonna do something productive while i'm here--

158
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,897
Get a job or--or an internship.

159
00:07:20,415 --> 00:07:22,002
Mom, say something.

160
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:25,380
Well, serena, if this is just a case of cold feet, fine.

161
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,430
I mean, classes have barely begun.

162
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,480
It's not about cold feet.

163
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,170
I'm just not ready. I don't know who i am.

164
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,180
But that's why people go to college--to figure it out.

165
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,720
Wasn't that the point of this summer ?

166
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,180
You were going to europe to find yourself ?

167
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:43,545
Well, i didn't find...what i was looking for.

168
00:07:43,744 --> 00:07:46,320
Well, unless your real self is waiting for you at antik,

169
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,650
I don't see the point in another year
of gallivanting around new york.

170
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,788
I told you, i'm going to work.

171
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:54,810
I love you, serena,

172
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,110
But you have never worked a day in your life.

173
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,350
Look, why don't you give college a try ?

174
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,450
If it takes me getting a job for you to believe
that i'm serious, then i'll do it.

175
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,025
But for now, i am not going to college.

176
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,530
I'm sorry, lil. I debated calling you.

177
00:08:17,392 --> 00:08:18,960
It's okay, honey. I understand.

178
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,680
You knew i was with my mother,
And you didn't want to burden me.

179
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:25,775
But make no mistake. I am back, and she is going to brown.

180
00:08:28,014 --> 00:08:29,576
All right, i'm gonna unpack.

181
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,380
There is no more hierarchy.

182
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,819
The steps of the met will no longer
be restricted to a certain crowd.

183
00:08:38,065 --> 00:08:40,640
No more nair-tinis. No more headbands.

184
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:42,309
This is a new era.

185
00:08:43,471 --> 00:08:44,927
Let freedom reign.

186
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,876
<i>well, well. Word is that change
is in the air at constance billard.</i>

187
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,250
the madness and genius of skeletor.
That is correct. I said "genius."

188
00:08:58,415 --> 00:09:03,620
<i>i have to wonder when queen b. finds out
how little J is treating her legacy...</i>

189
00:09:03,954 --> 00:09:05,375
<i>will she let it slide ?</i>

190
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:07,110
<i>Help ! Jenny Humphrey is destroying everything !</i>

191
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,557
Oh, thank god.

192
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:15,022
By the way, sandals are not shoes.

193
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:21,400
Uh, no, she's not here yet, but the room looks great.

194
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,794
She should be here any second.

195
00:09:22,844 --> 00:09:25,295
Um, hello ? Excuse me ?

196
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,857
Oh, i gotta go. I will call you back. Bye.

197
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,280
You must be vanessa abrams.

198
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:33,540
Yeah. Um, i got a message from the housing office today

199
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,250
Saying that my new roommate was coming in.

200
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,670
- Are you-
- no, i just work for her.

201
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,750
I hope you don't mind.
We gave the room a little lift.

202
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,940
I see that you took down my godard poster.

203
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,310
This is for you. I've given one to all the girls in the hall.

204
00:09:45,654 --> 00:09:49,890
Hold on. What is all this stuff, And--and who is my roommate ?

205
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,300
<i>and still no word from our reclusive starlet,</i>

206
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,070
but i have a feeling...

207
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,386
Uh, that'd be me.

208
00:09:57,738 --> 00:09:59,558
Oh, my god.

209
00:09:59,863 --> 00:10:01,979
we're in for a blockbuster.

210
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:05,490
I'm so sorry.

211
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:09,070
I had no idea that my publicist was doing all this stuff.

212
00:10:09,427 --> 00:10:12,020
And for the record, i love godard.

213
00:10:12,364 --> 00:10:15,851
I'm just trying to wrap my head around the fact that my roommate is...

214
00:10:16,378 --> 00:10:17,670
olivia burke.

215
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,216
And mine's...Vanessa abrams.

216
00:10:21,627 --> 00:10:24,688
Just two girls going to n.y.u.

217
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:26,960
It's crazy, right ?

218
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:28,292
Yeah.

219
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,957
Is that a confidentiality waiver ?

220
00:10:35,152 --> 00:10:36,655
K.c. Gave this to you ?

221
00:10:37,122 --> 00:10:39,106
Yeah, and the rest of the hall.

222
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:43,062
I cannot believe her.

223
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:44,741
Excuse me.

224
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,180
Thank you so much for seeing me on short notice.

225
00:10:51,407 --> 00:10:53,810
You came highly recommended by anna wintour.

226
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,290
I was happy to make the time.

227
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,880
Tell me about yourself.

228
00:10:57,143 --> 00:11:00,314
Um, i-i grew up on the upper east side.

229
00:11:00,364 --> 00:11:04,061
I, um, i've always been interested in fashion and art.

230
00:11:04,378 --> 00:11:07,430
I graduated from constance billard this past june.

231
00:11:07,631 --> 00:11:09,810
I was supposed to start brown a few weeks ago,

232
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,590
But then i realized i wasn't ready.

233
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,075
So you come here ?

234
00:11:13,768 --> 00:11:15,999
Fashion isn't fallback college, you know.

235
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:19,070
No, i know. Yeah, i-i understand that.

236
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,250
We're thrilled you're serious about this.

237
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,180
Yeah, you know, i want more life experience,

238
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:25,500
And with the work you're doing with a.p.f...

239
00:11:25,645 --> 00:11:27,864
...i find so interesting.

240
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,920
I will work for nothing. It can be like an internship.

241
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:33,353
So do you think that you have anything ?

242
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:39,800
No, nothing. They all want me to come to their parties,

243
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,191
But none of them want me to actually work for them.

244
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:45,327
No, i'm taking myself to lunch at hundred acres.

245
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:48,051
Why do you sound so happy ?

246
00:11:48,944 --> 00:11:51,445
What do you mean, you had to quell a revolution ?

247
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,760
Blair, i gotta go. I'll call you later.

248
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,350
Why are you not listening to me ?

249
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,600
I am not asking the girls in my hall
to sign confidentiality waivers.

250
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,260
They already hate me enough.

251
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,640
They don't hate you,

252
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,186
at least not after i sent them all
invites to your premiere tomorrow.

253
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,178
You really don't get it.

254
00:12:08,698 --> 00:12:12,580
I told you that i wanted to have a normal college experience.

255
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,650
But, honey, this is your moment, okay ?

256
00:12:15,921 --> 00:12:20,125
I mean, this movie is--is good-bye
teenage vampires and hello, oscar.

257
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:24,721
All right, i'm backing off.

258
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:26,611
You know, you have "larry king" tonight.

259
00:12:30,942 --> 00:12:34,195
Oh, great. Did you call them ?

260
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,340
Olivia, calm down.

261
00:12:36,485 --> 00:12:38,778
Don't tell me to calm down.

262
00:12:38,942 --> 00:12:40,400
Why do you always do this ?

263
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,089
- Ex-excuse me ?
- What ?

264
00:12:43,157 --> 00:12:45,450
I'm sorry. That was really rude.

265
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,160
Uh, yes, hi.

266
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,260
Don't worry about it. Um, just go through the kitchen,

267
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,260
Make a left at the freezer and then a right.
It'll put you out on sullivan.

268
00:12:52,454 --> 00:12:54,060
They were following me around for a while,

269
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,262
So i learned the back exits everywhere.

270
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,434
Wow. Thanks.

271
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:00,994
You're serena, right ?

272
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,530
Um, i loved your dress at the met ball.

273
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,825
Oh. Thank you.

274
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:09,697
Don't forget--"larry king."

275
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,525
That was amazing.

276
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,291
You're like the diva whisperer.

277
00:13:16,855 --> 00:13:19,960
I'm kenny cunningham, k.c. I'm olivia's publicist.

278
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,520
Serena van der woodsen.

279
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,590
I know.

280
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,130
So, um, are you going to college in the city ?

281
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,350
Uh, no, i-i deferred for a year.

282
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,216
I'm actually looking for a job.

283
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,664
Really ?

284
00:13:34,644 --> 00:13:36,751
Have you ever thought about publicity ?

285
00:13:41,818 --> 00:13:43,910
This is not a democracy, ladies.

286
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,610
Everyone does not get a voice, and that's okay.

287
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,870
What is this ? Did you not hear me this morning ?

288
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,200
Oh, you mean your cute little attempt at perestroika ?

289
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,850
We're going back to the old way--

290
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,630
Queens, hierarchy and no brooklyn wannabes.

291
00:13:56,846 --> 00:13:58,326
Sorry, little j.

292
00:13:58,678 --> 00:14:00,333
Who told you to call me that ?

293
00:14:05,404 --> 00:14:10,300
Okay, unless i'm blind, Their headbands
were monogrammed with "b.w."

294
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:12,496
What a surprise.

295
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,706
I can't believe you didn't get that girl's number.

296
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,230
How long is bree in texas ?

297
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,490
'Cause, uh, maybe she should help you out
with your english paper.

298
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,665
Oh, i'm sorry. You just expect more game from

299
00:14:23,715 --> 00:14:25,614
the guy who dated serena van der woodsen.

300
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:28,530
Hey. There--there she is.

301
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,390
- What ?
- That's--that's--that's kate,

302
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,930
The girl we've been talking about. She's right there.

303
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:35,588
that girl ?

304
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:37,596
- Yeah.
- Dude, that...

305
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,241
Is a sign that you should go ask her out.

306
00:14:46,332 --> 00:14:47,212
okay.

307
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,428
All right.You know what ? I will.

308
00:14:56,678 --> 00:14:57,805
Hey, kate.

309
00:14:59,522 --> 00:15:01,800
Uh, k--Kate ?

310
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:08,780
Hey. sorry.

00:15:11,946 --> 00:15:14,960
Sorry. Uh, i have a lot on my mind.

313
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:17,226
Right. Right. How's your first day going ?

314
00:15:17,378 --> 00:15:20,478
It's been a harder adjustment than i expected.

315
00:15:21,401 --> 00:15:25,050
yeah, well, listen, i still want to pay you back...
for this morning, so, um,

316
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,095
<i>Larry King Called.
Where are you ?</i>

317
00:15:26,145 --> 00:15:28,321
I thought maybe we could grab some pizza sometime

318
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:31,432
Or--or, you --ow, like, tomorrow or...

319
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:33,830
What about right now ?

320
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,301
Right--right now ?

321
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,090
I mean, yeah, sure. Right now is perfect. Right now is great.

322
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,588
In fact, i, uh, i know a place around the corner.

323
00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:42,020
Okay.

324
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,811
Oh, my god. Unbelievable.

325
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,730
We have a movie premiere tomorrow.

326
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,890
I'm gonna ask you to work with olivia's costar.

327
00:16:00,197 --> 00:16:02,190
Your background experience with the press--

328
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,780
I think you are just what she needs.

329
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,390
I appreciate your confidence.

330
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,740
Thank me later.

331
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,814
you are clueless ! This is too blue !

332
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:13,316
This is too pink ! This is too red !

333
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:16,500
K.c., this is the most important night of my life,

334
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,506
And you have me surrounded by amateurs ?

335
00:16:18,556 --> 00:16:21,353
And color-blind amateurs with hidden agendas ?

336
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:24,735
You know that nobody supports me.

337
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:26,966
everybody wants to see me fail.

338
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:31,554
Ursula, i want you to meet serena van der woodsen.

339
00:16:33,421 --> 00:16:38,188
<i>poor S. No one told her this was going to be a horror movie.</i>

340
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:45,021
You must have thought i was crazy.

341
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,500
No, i didn't think you were crazy.

342
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,773
Oh, please.

343
00:16:48,984 --> 00:16:52,565
You know you were like, "let me get this crazy lady to a party."

344
00:16:52,988 --> 00:16:55,770
and thank god you did, because
i've been cooped up here all day long.

345
00:16:55,943 --> 00:16:57,780
Okay, maybe a little crazy.

346
00:16:58,244 --> 00:17:02,870
Okay, serena, i'm sorry that i had you stay here
and sleep on this couch.

347
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,970
It's just--the stress of this movie is
making me feel like i'm losing my mind.

348
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,250
Well, it sounds fantastic.

349
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,600
And i never knew josephine baker was
a part of the french resistance.

350
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:12,488
it's an amazing part.

351
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:17,240
okay, there's this one scene where we're trapped by the nazis,

352
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:20,067
And i have to distract them while the others escape.

353
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:22,137
And i think...

354
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:26,294
It's probably the best work i've ever done.

355
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,042
Chuck, what are you doing here ?

356
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:34,920
I would ask you the same question.

357
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,240
I stopped by your dorm last night. No one was home.

358
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,870
Oh, i didn't tell you ?

359
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,200
I've been tutoring a few girls from constance.We went late.

360
00:17:43,576 --> 00:17:47,063
Well, i found this--An invitation to a movie premiere.

361
00:17:47,617 --> 00:17:51,222
It appears your entire hall is attending,
And since my evening is free...

362
00:17:51,272 --> 00:17:54,920
You thought you'd help me curry favor
with my outer-borough hall mates.

363
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,080
Sweet.

364
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,310
But unfortunately, i've already scheduled

365
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,133
an all-night cram session with my tutees, so...

366
00:18:02,462 --> 00:18:06,770
Miss blair ? You want me set beds
before manicurists arrive or--

367
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,815
Thank you, dorota. That will be all.

368
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:16,141
You're sure you said "cram session"
and not the annual waldorf sleepover ?

369
00:18:17,949 --> 00:18:18,888
Fine.

370
00:18:19,194 --> 00:18:21,240
I'm hosting the sleepover.

371
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,056
But jenny humphrey is destroying everything I worked for,

372
00:18:24,106 --> 00:18:27,090
And those girls deserve to learn the meaning of aristocracy.

373
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,177
We both know it's not about that.

374
00:18:30,536 --> 00:18:32,490
I have no idea what you're talking about.

375
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,573
Now I have work to do, but feel free to attend the movie alone.

376
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:42,535
I have dr. Hannum. He's english lit. He studied with faulkner.

377
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:44,790
This is so nice of you to help me.

378
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,320
- Sharing wisdom is what college is all about, right ?

379
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,232
That, and, uh, and finding the cheapest lebanese food.

380
00:18:50,973 --> 00:18:55,247
Which, um, i-i-i thought i'd show you tonight, if...

381
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,970
Y-you know--you know what ? I'm sorry.

382
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,520
That's--that's two nights in a row.
It's a huge dating taboo.

383
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,567
No. No, it's that i have to work.

384
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:06,667
I was supposed to last night, and i blew it off, so...

385
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:10,048
Dan, i like you.

386
00:19:11,147 --> 00:19:13,882
But i think my life is more complicated than you know.

387
00:19:14,106 --> 00:19:16,736
Try me. I think i can handle it.

388
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,140
Look, i-i-i really like you, too.

389
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,330
You're funny and smart, And... You know what ?

390
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,850
I'm just gonna throw it out there--you're beautiful.

391
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,330
I mean, an alarming number of people actually
stop on the street just to stare at you.

392
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:34,035
And on top of that, you're refreshingly normal.

393
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,112
what do you mean by "refreshingly normal" ?

394
00:19:39,486 --> 00:19:42,380
Well, the last girl i dated, her--
her life was never really out of the spotlight,

395
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,716
So it made things kind of hard.

396
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,900
<i>Where are you ? U need to get ready for the premiere !</i>

397
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:53,513
I gotta go.

398
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:57,305
So can i-- can i call you tomorrow ?Or...

399
00:19:58,479 --> 00:20:02,533
Dan, i'm not sure i'm the girl you're looking for,

400
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:05,139
Even if part of me wishes i was.

401
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:06,970
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

402
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,928
You will. I'm sorry.

403
00:20:14,234 --> 00:20:15,530
congratulations.

404
00:20:15,675 --> 00:20:17,848
Your girlfriend's installed a puppet regime.

405
00:20:18,764 --> 00:20:21,476
Blair's gone colonel kurtz.

406
00:20:22,316 --> 00:20:25,122
She needs to be brought back to reality.

407
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,449
Help me.

408
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,281
I'll help you take back the crown.

409
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:29,625
Why ?

410
00:20:29,675 --> 00:20:30,920
They don't want my kind of leadership.

411
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,620
They want a tyrant who will police their behavior

412
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,184
And chart their movement on the social ladder.

413
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,532
- Find someone else.
- I need you.

414
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:43,372
You're fooling yourself if you don't think
you were born to rule this school.

415
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,850
People change, chuck.

416
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,859
Not you, not about this.

417
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:51,010
The jenny humphrey who used to sit in brooklyn
and watch the lights across the water,

418
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:56,204
Who went toe-to-toe with blair waldorf
and actually won her respect--

419
00:20:57,613 --> 00:21:00,176
You can't tell me that girl isn't still in there.

420
00:21:02,148 --> 00:21:04,673
Now that the dream is coming true,

421
00:21:05,624 --> 00:21:07,811
You owe it to her to live it.

422
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:11,286
Blair doesn't want me to be queen.

423
00:21:12,026 --> 00:21:14,257
Well, maybe we can make her reconsider.

424
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:19,410
where is it ? You've lost it !

425
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,970
Hold on. Where have you been ?

426
00:21:21,124 --> 00:21:22,810
I had to get my dress. What's going on ?

427
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,280
I don't know. Get in there.

428
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,190
My mother's ring--i lost it.

429
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,151
I cannot go to the premiere without
my mother's ring.It's my good luck charm.

430
00:21:33,201 --> 00:21:36,910
Ursula, you--you put it in your bag yesterday. Here.

431
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,145
Oh, thank you.

432
00:21:39,357 --> 00:21:40,766
of course.

433
00:21:40,954 --> 00:21:43,795
Honey, time's a-wasting. You need to get ready.

434
00:21:45,276 --> 00:21:46,210
i'm so nervous.

435
00:21:46,407 --> 00:21:47,940
It's gonna be great.

436
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:49,705
okay.

437
00:21:54,912 --> 00:21:56,532
Hey, is everything okay ?

438
00:21:58,035 --> 00:21:59,843
I just heard from the producers.

439
00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:02,426
That scene ursula's so proud of ?

440
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:03,788
It got cut.

441
00:22:03,938 --> 00:22:04,912
What ?

442
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:08,435
We have to tell her.

443
00:22:09,656 --> 00:22:11,041
Serena, no.

444
00:22:12,345 --> 00:22:16,480
I know this is difficult, But if we tell her,
she'll ditch the premiere,

445
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,560
Which will hurt her career enormously.Trust me.

446
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:21,307
No, this is for her own good.

447
00:22:23,808 --> 00:22:25,604
Thanks. I gotta take this.

448
00:22:27,063 --> 00:22:29,987
serena, can you help me ?Can you help me with my hair ?

449
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,015
<i>Convinced Lily to come to the premiere. See you there.</i>

450
00:22:33,065 --> 00:22:35,640
<i>Serena ? Serena ? I need help with my hair.</i>

451
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,480
<i>I really hope you can come--your rommie </i>

452
00:22:44,861 --> 00:22:45,820
Hey.

453
00:22:46,352 --> 00:22:48,010
so i think i just got dumped.

454
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,614
You maybe want to go see a movie or something like that ?

455
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,320
Yeah. A movie sounds great.

456
00:22:54,591 --> 00:22:56,799
But you're gonna have to wear a suit.

457
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:14,409
<i>I'm here. Where are u ?</i>

458
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:41,590
Blair, o.m.g.b.s.e.

459
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,050
Oh, my god. Best sleepover ever.

460
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:46,660
Yes, i suppose it is adequate.

461
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,061
Dorota, these martinis taste like tap water.
Don't be a scrooge with the gin.

462
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,996
Miss blair, this not right.

463
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,800
Mr. Chuck and I both of the opinion--

464
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,499
And who cares what you and mr. Chuck think ?

465
00:24:00,887 --> 00:24:01,896
szybko.

466
00:24:03,438 --> 00:24:07,677
Now who wants to hear how i got the great
chuck bass to tell me he loved me ?

467
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,440
Exquisite.

468
00:24:21,656 --> 00:24:24,450
You exceed even my high expectations.

469
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,120
I'm only here for the good of the school, chuck.

470
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:30,002
And i'm only here for blair.

471
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:39,259
And now for one of the most time-honored
traditions of the sleepover-- truth or dare.

472
00:24:46,129 --> 00:24:49,123
Hey. I'm not talking to hear myself speak.

473
00:24:49,173 --> 00:24:50,730
Sorry, blair.

474
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,590
It's... Just...

475
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:56,773
Gossip girl says jenny humphrey's at the
premiere of olivia burke's new movie...

476
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,276
And she's with...

477
00:24:59,802 --> 00:25:00,762
Who ?

478
00:25:03,272 --> 00:25:05,190
<i>spotted on the red carpet--</i>

479
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,730
<i>jenny humphrey on the arm of the red baron, chuck bass.</i>

480
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,976
<i>guess queen b. isn't starring in this melodrama.</i>

481
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,571
Oh, my god.

482
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:22,300
Rufus, why are you dragging me to this ?

483
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,370
You really couldn't wait till it comes out in the theaters ?

484
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,050
Are you kidding ? Nazis and cabaret singers--

485
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:29,750
It's like "casablanca" meets "showgirls."

486
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,840
This is my dream movie.

487
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,970
How did you get tickets to the premiere ?

488
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,587
I have a connection.

489
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:37,827
Mom. Rufus, thank you.

490
00:25:37,979 --> 00:25:40,269
No problem. Um, this is some event.

491
00:25:40,727 --> 00:25:43,630
What is going on ? Did you two arrange this ?

492
00:25:44,264 --> 00:25:46,370
Hmm. I-i'm gonna go and, uh,

493
00:25:47,364 --> 00:25:49,689
Get another bag of popcorn, just in case.

494
00:25:52,807 --> 00:25:55,000
So i got a job with a publicist,

495
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:58,925
And i thought if you saw me working,
You would feel better about brown.

496
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,820
Right. Yes.

497
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,550
Because, um, a year of parties and premieres

498
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,974
is a worthy alternative to an ivy league education.

499
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:12,885
Mom...Please don't make me regret inviting you here.

500
00:26:13,366 --> 00:26:15,714
I've got a lot to worry about already.

501
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,387
Fine, fine, no brown talk.

502
00:26:21,392 --> 00:26:22,637
Now tell me.

503
00:26:23,846 --> 00:26:27,480
Well, um, i've become friends with ursula nyquist,

504
00:26:27,882 --> 00:26:33,063
And she's really counting on this movie
and her big scene, which has been cut.

505
00:26:33,615 --> 00:26:36,340
K.c., my boss, doesn't want me to tell her.

506
00:26:36,715 --> 00:26:40,390
Well, you have to, I mean, if she really is a friend. Right ?

507
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,328
But k.c. Believes that it's for her own good,
And--and k.c.'s my boss.

508
00:26:47,415 --> 00:26:53,285
This woman saw an opportunity to exploit
your celebrity and your connections.

509
00:26:53,438 --> 00:26:57,872
Why else would she hire an 18-year-old with
no skills and no college degree ?

510
00:26:58,295 --> 00:27:00,180
Maybe because she believes in me.

511
00:27:00,373 --> 00:27:02,430
Serena, i've been looking all over for you.

512
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,590
Oh, ursula, this is my mom lily. Lily, this is ursula.

513
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,646
Nice to meet you.

514
00:27:06,696 --> 00:27:09,445
Hi. Nice to meet you, too.
Can i talk to your daughter for a second ?

515
00:27:10,384 --> 00:27:11,744
Is everything okay ?

516
00:27:12,171 --> 00:27:14,085
I feel like people are whispering.

517
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:17,592
No, every-everything's fine.

518
00:27:18,731 --> 00:27:20,735
Look, w-we should get you inside.

519
00:27:20,785 --> 00:27:22,594
Mom, i got work to do.

520
00:27:30,245 --> 00:27:32,041
Oh, my god. Dan.

521
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,580
Hey.

522
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,770
What are you doing here ?

523
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,990
Me ? I could ask you the same thing.

524
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,590
You're supposed to be working, right ?

525
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,990
You're not serious.

526
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,490
See, it's fine if you didn't want to go out with me.

527
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,670
It's really--really--i mean, you didn't have to lie about it.

528
00:27:43,883 --> 00:27:45,490
No, i-i didn't.

529
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,690
Uh, you know what ? I gotta find vanessa. I'm sorry.

530
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,595
Vanessa ? W-wait. Like vanessa abrams ?

531
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:54,633
Yeah. She's--she's my friend, how do you know her ?

532
00:27:56,524 --> 00:27:59,459
dan, i-i have to tell you something.

533
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:02,480
O-olivia. Olivia, hey, can we get...

534
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,050
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's that ?
What's--what's going on right there ?

535
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,103
Why are they...

536
00:28:07,044 --> 00:28:07,949
You...

537
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:12,293
Oh, my--oh, my god. Are you--you're not...

538
00:28:13,334 --> 00:28:14,262
Fleur.

539
00:28:14,438 --> 00:28:15,777
You are. Yeah.

540
00:28:16,352 --> 00:28:17,374
I'm sorry.

541
00:28:18,078 --> 00:28:19,530
- Hey.
- Hey.

542
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,770
You met olivia ?

543
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,197
Yeah. Yeah, apparently.

544
00:28:25,201 --> 00:28:26,798
these are the plans from de gaulle.

545
00:28:26,848 --> 00:28:28,770
i smuggled them in with my sheet music.

546
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,551
germans. They cannot be allowed to have these documents.

547
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:37,700
i'll distract them while you slip out the back.

548
00:28:37,852 --> 00:28:38,768
but how ?

549
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:40,863
how else ? I'll sing.

550
00:28:54,393 --> 00:28:56,319
I never heard her song,

551
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:00,734
but i owe josephine my life, as does france.

552
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,880
next day, i was in london.

553
00:29:21,452 --> 00:29:23,530
Hold on. Wait, wait. She's in the stall.

554
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:26,080
We'll give her another minute,
Then we'll let her go in front of cameras.

555
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,920
No, but i-i thought that was bad for her.

556
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,520
That's why we didn't tell her in the first place.

557
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:32,720
Serena, an actress who finds out that her scene is cut

558
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,200
And skips the premiere is a lame story.

559
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:38,290
An actress who finds it out during the premiere,
Then has a meltdown--

560
00:29:38,447 --> 00:29:40,370
now that is great public theater.

561
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:41,890
So you lied to me.

562
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:44,230
Only because you couldn't deal with the truth.

563
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:47,701
I needed ursula to trust you, like i do now.

564
00:29:49,207 --> 00:29:52,386
Ursula, honey, it's time to come out.

565
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:54,457
Serena's here.

566
00:30:05,627 --> 00:30:07,950
- Did you really think that your lame attempt...
- Blair.

567
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,763
- To embarrass me would you get back queen ?
- Blair.Blair, stop it.

568
00:30:09,813 --> 00:30:11,935
- I will make your life a living hell.
- Blair, calm--

569
00:30:11,985 --> 00:30:13,665
It wasn't her idea.

570
00:30:16,321 --> 00:30:17,448
This was you ?

571
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:21,430
Do you have any idea how much you humiliated me ?

572
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,944
I think you accomplished that with
your little teenybopper sleepover.

573
00:30:27,465 --> 00:30:28,886
Look, n.y.u.'s hard,

574
00:30:30,131 --> 00:30:31,980
But blair waldorf does not give up.

575
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,301
I'm not giving up.

576
00:30:33,487 --> 00:30:35,290
I've made a strategic retreat.

577
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,869
Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.

578
00:30:37,574 --> 00:30:38,510
You don't understand.

579
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,530
I do understand. Let me help.

580
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,360
No, chuck. N.y.u. is not the upper east side.

581
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,930
They don't care about constance or the social hierarchy.

582
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,348
They don't care that i'm blair waldorf.

583
00:30:50,954 --> 00:30:52,176
It's over.

584
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,805
And you'd do this to me ?

585
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:57,060
What are you talking about ?

586
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:01,833
I'm chuck bass, and I told you I love you.

587
00:31:02,373 --> 00:31:04,790
You're saying i'm easier to win over

588
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,884
Than a bunch of pseudo-intellectual, homesick malcontents ?

589
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,890
You'd really insult me like this ?

590
00:31:12,044 --> 00:31:14,495
- That's not how it is.
- It's exactly how it is.

591
00:31:15,493 --> 00:31:19,333
So the next time you forget you're blair waldorf,

592
00:31:19,532 --> 00:31:23,628
Remember, i'm chuck bass, and I love you.

593
00:31:43,546 --> 00:31:44,486
Hey.

594
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:47,690
Great movie.

595
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,435
You were, uh, you were amazing.

596
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,967
And i'm an idiot.

597
00:31:51,648 --> 00:31:55,111
No, i sh--I should have told you who i was.

598
00:31:56,685 --> 00:31:58,141
Why didn't you ?

599
00:32:01,828 --> 00:32:04,989
I have been dreaming of coming to n.y.u.

600
00:32:05,388 --> 00:32:07,901
And just being a normal student.

601
00:32:08,476 --> 00:32:12,445
And my very first day, this cute guy doesn't recognize me.

602
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,034
I couldn't help myself.

603
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,052
And my middle name's kate.

604
00:32:20,811 --> 00:32:24,712
You said it yourself, that i was refreshingly normal.

605
00:32:25,816 --> 00:32:29,479
I did, yeah, i...You have to understand, though,

606
00:32:30,477 --> 00:32:33,726
That my last couple of relationships have been just--

607
00:32:33,879 --> 00:32:35,887
They--they've been full of drama.

608
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,064
All right, dan, i get it.

609
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,013
I do.

610
00:32:44,164 --> 00:32:48,981
And as much as i want to be kate, I'm also olivia,

611
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,480
And you don't want that.

612
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:56,580
I'm sorry.

613
00:33:01,218 --> 00:33:02,474
I'll see you around.

614
00:33:07,547 --> 00:33:08,768
Um, excuse me ?

615
00:33:09,473 --> 00:33:10,917
Uh, can i take you picture ?

616
00:33:11,363 --> 00:33:13,500
What ? Why ?

617
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:15,503
Aren't you blair waldorf ?

618
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,484
Yes. Yes, i guess i am.

619
00:33:28,143 --> 00:33:30,374
I can't believe they cut my scene.

620
00:33:30,938 --> 00:33:34,020
So go out there and--and throw the biggest fit of your life.

621
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,640
I mean, those producers screwed you.

622
00:33:37,356 --> 00:33:38,871
Go steal their show.

623
00:33:42,197 --> 00:33:44,381
Serena, is that what you think i should do ?

624
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:56,037
I-i think...if you want people to see you as--as a real actress,

625
00:33:56,087 --> 00:33:58,115
You should be gracious and...

626
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,788
And that the movie's more important than your scene.

627
00:34:02,293 --> 00:34:04,250
Ursula, she's a teenager. She knows nothing.

628
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,674
Kenny, shut up.

629
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:17,621
Thank you.

630
00:34:26,393 --> 00:34:28,566
I'm sorry. I-i couldn't do it to her.

631
00:34:28,742 --> 00:34:29,975
I understand...

632
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:33,796
Like i'm sure you understand that you're fired.

633
00:34:45,554 --> 00:34:46,670
I got fired.

634
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,800
K.c. wanted ursula to have a meltdown in front of the press,

635
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:52,525
And i told her not to, so k.c. fired me.

636
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:53,922
I guess you were right.

637
00:34:53,972 --> 00:34:56,170
Well, it's for the best. You'll love brown.

638
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,010
Mom, i'm not going to brown.

639
00:34:58,228 --> 00:34:59,978
Maybe next year, but not now.

640
00:35:00,028 --> 00:35:02,185
What are you talking about ? You're all packed.

641
00:35:02,502 --> 00:35:04,947
If this year is about finding out who i am,

642
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,820
Then i can't do that and live here.

643
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,530
Serena, enough is enough.

644
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,040
This need to find out who you are--

645
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,840
Do you think anyone really knows who they are ?

646
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,660
We don't. We just live.

647
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,568
So that's it ? That's your advice--to give up ?

648
00:35:23,926 --> 00:35:27,167
I'm sorry, but i'm not gonna do this your way.

649
00:35:30,454 --> 00:35:32,450
lil, she's gonna be okay.

650
00:35:33,295 --> 00:35:34,530
This is your fault.

651
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,920
- That's not fair.
- Not fair ?

652
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:40,201
I go away to take care of my mother, And i come back
and my daughter is not going to college.

653
00:35:40,494 --> 00:35:41,650
I trusted you.

654
00:35:41,797 --> 00:35:43,875
Then trust me now. Don't force her.

655
00:35:45,946 --> 00:35:47,907
I think I just need to be alone.

656
00:35:54,706 --> 00:35:55,540
Hey.

657
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,750
I loved the movie last night,

658
00:35:57,971 --> 00:36:00,296
Though it was no "endless knights."

659
00:36:00,777 --> 00:36:02,844
Don't say anything. I'm a closet fan.

660
00:36:05,662 --> 00:36:09,450
So i'm gonna pretend that you're not a movie star,

661
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,077
And we're just two roommates.

662
00:36:15,555 --> 00:36:17,645
Coming here, i just--

663
00:36:17,695 --> 00:36:21,696
I wanted to be normal, everyday me.

664
00:36:23,091 --> 00:36:26,590
And amazingly enough, i met someone who liked that person.

665
00:36:27,758 --> 00:36:30,494
But i can't pretend that the other one doesn't exist.

666
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:36,308
I dated a guy who kept part of himself hidden.

667
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:39,620
He never gave anyone a chance to accept him.

668
00:36:40,582 --> 00:36:45,199
And... In the end, Everyone lost.

669
00:36:48,112 --> 00:36:51,917
Dan's... a really special guy.

670
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,672
I'm gonna go.

671
00:37:07,244 --> 00:37:09,875
We're like real roommates.

672
00:37:10,673 --> 00:37:12,927
That's kind of totally awesome.

673
00:37:18,772 --> 00:37:20,322
Of course, s.

674
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:22,470
mi casa, su casa.

675
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,930
I sound chipper ?

676
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,322
Well, i'm on my way to a meeting.

677
00:37:25,372 --> 00:37:27,142
Just a little club i'm starting.

678
00:37:28,641 --> 00:37:31,353
Oh, you all made it. Excellent.

679
00:37:32,445 --> 00:37:34,148
Now here's the situation.

680
00:37:34,829 --> 00:37:36,830
Each of us attended elite schools,

681
00:37:37,016 --> 00:37:42,335
Failed to go ivy and now find ourselves
wasting away in a patchouli-scented purgatory.

682
00:37:42,795 --> 00:37:45,132
Do we deserve it ? No.

683
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,490
Do we need to put up with it ?

684
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:49,230
Definitely not.

685
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,649
What do you suggest ?

686
00:37:50,837 --> 00:37:53,584
Candide said, "on doit cultiver son jardin."

687
00:37:54,019 --> 00:37:58,020
Well, n.y.u. Is my garden, and i plan to rake and hoe and weed it

688
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,646
Till it looks exactly the way i want.

689
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:03,765
But i can't do it alone. Now who's with me ?

<i>I need some one on one tuto***</i>

695

<i>I'll see you later- in uniform</i>

697
00:38:40,798 --> 00:38:42,550
That concludes our business.

698
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:45,401
So, uh, why'd you want me to take that girl's picture ?

699
00:38:46,229 --> 00:38:48,178
Dumbo could always fly.

700
00:38:48,918 --> 00:38:50,879
He just needed a magic feather.

And i told her that if you do not work for her firm,

707
00:39:11,503 --> 00:39:12,771
I'm not a client.

708
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:17,536

709
00:39:17,586 --> 00:39:21,024
Please.Serena, you helped me find myself.

710
00:39:23,307 --> 00:39:25,984

717
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,446

00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,337
So, scott, i... Really was...

719
00:39:54,917 --> 00:39:56,173

720
00:39:56,838 --> 00:39:59,339
Uh, vanessa, i'm so sorry. I gotta take this.

721
00:39:59,668 --> 00:40:00,949

Georgina, hey. What's up ?

725
00:40:16,357 --> 00:40:19,300
No, i'll be there in a second.I'm a block from the restaurant.

726
00:40:19,466 --> 00:40:21,721
<i>but life isn't a fairy tale...</i>

727
00:40:30,067 --> 00:40:33,425
and happy endings are few and far between...

728
00:40:37,656 --> 00:40:41,085
Hey, jenny. Is there anything we can do for you ?

729
00:40:41,332 --> 00:40:44,780
<i>in life, the young queen becomes a tyrant...</i>

730
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,020
Actually, go make sure my spot's free at the met steps

731
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,033
And wait there with a yogurt for me.

732
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:58,430
<i>and takes her subjects to war...</i>

733
00:40:58,855 --> 00:41:01,150
And if you do want to wear them,
you just need to make sure...

734
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,387
<i>so that's why we need movies...</i>

735
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,148
hi.

736
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:07,820
<i>to remind us that despite it all,</i>

737
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:11,810
<i>love can still spring in the most unlikely of places...</i>

738
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:16,870
I was just thinking, i didn't really give you
a chance to know both sides of me,

739
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,167
And i guess I'm wondering if you still want to.

740
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,230
I don't even know why i'm pretending to think about it.

741
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,532
Yes. Yes, of course.

742
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,385
