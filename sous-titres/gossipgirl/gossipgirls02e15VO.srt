Gossip Girl here. Your one and only source

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,130
Into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,330
I broke up with Aron.

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,260
I needed to make sure that we still felt the same.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,700
Soon as that will is read and I get my money,

6
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:11,945
You won't ever see me again.

7
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,160
what are you doing?

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,345
Or is this not you

9
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,560
With my 15-year-old sister?

10
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,830
Truth is, I wasn't ready to have a baby.

11
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,060
I understand why you gave him up,

12
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,350
But it's that you didn't tell me.

13
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:22,600
You can't ask me to hide this

14
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,410
From Serena. This is too big to keep secret.

15
00:00:24,445 --> 00:00:26,030
Son, this isn't your secret to share.

16
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,230
It was my dad. He and Lily are going away for a couple days.

17
00:00:28,265 --> 00:00:29,960
Chuck, your father wouldn't have wanted this.

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,400
UnfortuNately, all I know is what he didn't want,

19
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,880
Which was me.

20
00:00:33,915 --> 00:00:35,400
I do. I'll always be here.

第二季 第十五集

24
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,960
When most people lose a parent, they inherit sorrow,

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,615
Loss and a closet

26
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,300
And a closet full of outdated clothes.

27
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,300
But on the upper east side,

28
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,830
Death's sad chapter comes with a silver lining...

29
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,330
Or a gold one,

30
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,660
If your relatives invested wisely in precious metals.

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,800
Good morning, Jack.

32
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,030
- Blair. - Chuck asked me to come

33
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,995
To the reading of the will for support.

34
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,930
The only thing he's gonna need support for

35
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,500
Is the massive influx into his bank account.

36
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,300
Charming.

37
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,760
Come out with me tonight.

38
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,760
I told you I'm not interested.

39
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Didn't seem that way on new year's.

40
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,960
Whatever may have transpired between us,

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,200
What's important is what it means to me,

42
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,780
Which is nothing.

43
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,400
Do you think it would be nothing to Chuck?

44
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,630
Let's ask him now, shall we?

45
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,560
Let's not.

46
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:54,530
Aw. No one wants to play today, huh?

47
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,460
Let's get this over with.

48
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,000
Courage, nephew.

49
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,960
I'm going to be running Bass industries,

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,815
And you're about to inherit a billion dollars.

51
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,630
I know my father.

52
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,560
There'll be so many strings attached

53
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,560
I'll look like a marionette.

54
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,230
He wouldn't miss his last chance

55
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:10,860
to put me in my place.

56
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,700
Hey!

57
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,100
Thought you might need some backup.

58
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,300
Thanks. Let's go.

59
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,460
Hey, let's go.

60
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,915
Okay, wait.

61
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,400
Come on, admit it.

62
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,400
Dad and Lily are totally hooking up

63
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,260
On this trip to Boston.

64
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,430
No. Lily--Lily just lost her husband,

65
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,445
And dad is getting her out of town

66
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,395
So he can clear her head.

67
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,860
Okay, if that's what you want to call it.

68
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,640
Ooh, headphones on.

69
00:02:34,675 --> 00:02:35,345
No, come on.

70
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,718
You know it's true,

71
00:02:36,753 --> 00:02:38,091
And you just don't want to admit it

72
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:39,500
Because you and Serena are back together,

73
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,530
And that's the last thing you want

74
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,710
Is your parents falling in love again.

75
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,860
Whoa. they're not in love.

76
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,380
How can you be so sure?

77
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,860
because I-I am.

78
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,160
I wouldn't have come to this party if I knew I wasn't v.i.p.

79
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,130
The important thing is that Chuck knows we're here for him.

80
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,860
Blair.

81
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,700
Shh. I can't hear.

82
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,360
Now that we're all settled, please let me express

83
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,130
My deepest condolences.

84
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,400
As Mrs. Bass is unable to be here today,

85
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,160
Her interests are being represented by her counsel.

86
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,530
Now, Charles,

87
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,500
Your uncle Jack Bass is your closest living relative,

88
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,130
And, as such, has been named your legal guardian.

89
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,710
Are you comfortable with this?

90
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,260
Curfew?

91
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,760
None.

92
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,930
Girls sleeping over?

93
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:29,060
Yes, please.

94
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,580
With regard to mr. Bass' personal assets,

95
00:03:29,615 --> 00:03:30,060
Moving on then.

96
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,230
They will be put in a trust which you, charles,

97
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,130
Will have access to on your 18th birthday.

98
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,600
And as for Bass industries?

99
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,900
Yes, I was just getting to that.

100
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,830
29% of the company will remain in the board's hands,

101
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,600
And a 20% stake in the company has been left to Lily Bass.

102
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,115
Okay, but that still leaves 51%.

103
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,600
That's the controlling interest.

104
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,900
Charles, Mr. Bass asked me to give you this letter.

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If I don't read it, do I still get my inheritance?

106
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,710
Well, yes.

107
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,460
Then I'll pass.

108
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,430
Chuck! Is everything okay?

109
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,760
Chuck, this letter represents your dad's final words.

110
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,960
Your dad wrote you a letter? you have to read it.

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,065
Ye, aren't you curious to know what it says?

112
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,130
Think I can guess.

113
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
"You're a disappointment of a son.

114
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,460
"I'd die of embarrassment if I wasn't already.

115
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,755
Why do you wear so much purple?

116
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,030
"Then you'll have the satisfaction of being right.

117
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
No.

118
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,960
I'll read it.

119
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,030
"Dear son,

120
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,630
- I know I've always been hard on you. - True.

121
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,430
But my goal was always to

122
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:45,200
prepare you for this day,

123
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,400
To help you go from being a boy to a man."

124
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,480
The italian au pair took care of that.

125
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:51,530
Chuck, please.

126
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,400
"Sadly, there is nothing like the passing of a father

127
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,530
"To aid in this rite of passage for his son.

128
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,000
"Ultimately, I do feel that I did my job

129
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,230
"And you're prepared for this next chapter of your life.

130
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,230
"Therefore, I'm bequeathing to you

131
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,058
The majority share of Bass industries."

132
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:11,518
Surely that's a mistake.

133
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,955
No, it's not. he believed in you.

134
00:05:12,956 --> 00:05:14,725
That son of a bitch.

135
00:05:14,726 --> 00:05:16,016
-Jack!  -no Jack's right.

136
00:05:16,017 --> 00:05:17,430
My father can't be one way my whole life

137
00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:19,000
Then all of a sudden, it's okay.

138
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,000
It's nice that he finally decided I'm worthy,

139
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,463
But I don't want it.

140
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,634
If you want it, you can have it.

141
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,200
Three times this week I planned a dinner with Jonathan,

142
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,560
And every time, Jenny just happened to show up.

143
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,530
Well, she doesn't have anyone else.

144
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,963
All the mean girls hate her.

145
00:05:45,964 --> 00:05:47,682
You gotta give her time to make new friends.

146
00:05:47,717 --> 00:05:49,400
But doesn't she understand the whole point

147
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,660
Of having a boyfriend is to be alone?

148
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,429
Yes. seems to be a problem with the entire Humphrey clan.

149
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,673
Dan is avoiding you

150
00:05:55,674 --> 00:05:57,256
Because he thinks our parents are getting back together.

151
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:58,370
You can't really blame him.

152
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:00,540
Well, I happen to know they're not,

153
00:06:00,545 --> 00:06:04,000
So he needs to stop being paranoid.

154
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,500
Okay, so as far as you know... hey. be nice to Jenny.

155
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,660
Hey! hey, eric! okay, guess what?

156
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,260
Jonathan and I decided that tonight we are gonna have

157
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,702
An edith head film festival.

158
00:06:13,703 --> 00:06:15,342
She says edith head, I say hitchcock.

159
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:16,900
Same difference.

160
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,430
Great. count me in. yay!

161
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,430
Oh, wait. oh, my gosh.

162
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,730
Oh, did you guys know that you have matching backpacks?

163
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,160
That's so cute. oh!

164
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:29,665
Dan.

165
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,660
Dan, hey.

166
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,660
Sorry, I'm a little out of it.

167
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,600
Look, I know you've been avoiding me,

168
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,692
But my mom called from boston this morning,

169
00:06:37,693 --> 00:06:40,800
And I asked her point-blank. you have nothing to worry about.

170
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,883
Well, who said anything about being worried?

171
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:45,760
Why, what did she say?

172
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,330
That there's nothing going on between her and Rufus.

173
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,325
Well, isn't that what you were worried about?

174
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:57,530
Yeah. uh, yeah. I just... I was really convinced,

175
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,030
But you know, if your mom says nothing's going on,

176
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,085
Then that's good. yeah, well, she usually is

177
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:02,551
Pretty honest about these things--

178
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:04,460
A little too honest, actually.

179
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:07,532
Supposedly sarkozy was a bad kisser.

180
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,700
Yeah, well, that's, uh, that's a relief--

181
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,360
Not the thing about sarkozy. That's kind of disappointing.

182
00:07:14,395 --> 00:07:15,700
So we're good then?

183
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,960
Yeah, we are. absolutely.

184
00:07:21,455 --> 00:07:22,705
Okay.

185
00:07:22,706 --> 00:07:25,022
I'll see you later.

186
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,260
Hey, Dan, what's up?

187
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,660
You do realize the whole reason Serena and I broke up

188
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,176
Was because she was being so secretive,

189
00:07:46,177 --> 00:07:47,559
And now I'm the one keeping secrets.

190
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,541
Lily's gonna talk to Eric and Serena

191
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:51,116
As soon as we get back.

192
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:54,360
In the meantime, you have to wait just like we do.

193
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,760
I-I just--I don't like lying to my girlfriend.

194
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,760
You know, Serena has a right to know what's going on.

195
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,860
Oh, my god. We have to tell Serena.

196
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,842
What? we don't know what he's lying about.

197
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:05,430
Why are you talking?

198
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,900
Last time I checked you were still on probation.

199
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,088
We should at least tell blair.

200
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,560
We can't. Blair's with Chuck again.

201
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,900
I'm really getting sick of how much time

202
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,600
She's spending with him. but his dad just died.

203
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,700
Yeah, like a month ago.

204
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,560
Afraid we're on our own for this one, ladies.

205
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,681
Chuck! stop!

206
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:31,060
It's like he's setting me up to fail from beyond the grave.

207
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,130
Do you really think bart would leave his whole company to you

208
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,080
- If he didn't think you could do it? - It doesn't make sense.

209
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,530
My father never trusted me with anything.

210
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,260
He's trusting you now. he left you his legacy.

211
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,430
I know you can do this.

212
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,630
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

213
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,630
Start by reading the rest of this.

214
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,744
Is lowly lonely boy cheating on our queen?

215
00:09:18,745 --> 00:09:20,260
Sound unlikely?

216
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,373
Does the name Georgina ring a bell?

217
00:09:23,374 --> 00:09:26,200
Get out your shovels and start digging the dirt, kids.

218
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,260
Gossip girl's gonna need a little help

219
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,230
Getting to the bottom of this mess.

220
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,230
Chuck. what's up? forget something?

221
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,260
I took a walk around the block, read my father's letter.

222
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,430
If it wasn't notarized, I'd think it was a fake.

223
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,830
Look, I owe you a lot, Jack.

224
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,900
You saved my life when I didn't want to be saved.

225
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,900
Well, you noticed that thai waitress

226
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,330
I was gonna take home the other night had a penis.

227
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,200
So consider us even.

228
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,130
Look, I've decided to follow my father's wishes

229
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,900
And take over Bass industries.

230
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,600
Well, we can discuss that when you turn 18.

231
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,160
Anyway, you're in charge in name.

232
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,850
It's better--all the fun, none of the work.

233
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:17,500
I want to start now, learning at least.

234
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,760
This isn't an after-school job.

235
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,430
You have no experience.

236
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,460
You're not ready.

237
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,960
If you want to stay in New York,

238
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,160
I'll find a place for you in the company.

239
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,060
I know it's going to be a long road...

240
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,100
But I'm ready now.

241
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,030
You missed one.

242
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,230
Wait, blair. Do you--

243
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,710
-What do you want, jack?

244
00:11:32,745 --> 00:11:34,160
You, obviously.

245
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,345
Hanging up!

246
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,560
But barring that, to apologize.

247
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,065
This whole process just

248
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,600
wasn't what I was expecting.

249
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,600
I, uh, I want to make it right.

250
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,600
Chuck's the only family I've got.

251
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,530
I know. Poor Chuck. Luckily, he has me.

252
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,760
What do you say we throw him a party

253
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,195
To celebrate him running the company?

254
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,630
Why not celebrate Bart dying?

255
00:11:51,665 --> 00:11:53,030
That would be just as tasteless.

256
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,460
Just something to show he has our support.

257
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,460
I'm having dinner with Chuck tonight.

258
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,530
He knows he has my support.

259
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,960
Blair, you know better than anyone how rough

260
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,730
Things have been for Chuck lately,

261
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,475
And unfortunately,

262
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,260
I didn't help the way I reacted this morning.

263
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,550
I really want to do something nice

264
00:12:09,585 --> 00:12:10,800
to celebrate.

265
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,030
I'll bring Chuck. you round up his friends.

266
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,100
And, blair, let's make it a surprise.

267
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,800
Fine.

268
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,130
Brunch tomorrow at the palace.

269
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,560
Sorry for the delay.

270
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,060
I was able to track down the adoptive family

271
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,560
Through your mother's lawyer, Mrs. Bass.

272
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,100
Unfortunately, that's as far as I could take it.

273
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:41,100
What do you mean as far as you can take it?

274
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,245
You haven't taken it anywhere..

275
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,360
Rufus, please.

276
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,995
With a closed adoption,

277
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,660
The only way the birth parents

278
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,660
Can track down and contact their child

279
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,400
Is if he registers with a search service.

280
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,810
Your son has not done this.

281
00:12:52,845 --> 00:12:54,260
Look, I wasn't aware of my child

282
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,200
Or his adoption when it happened.

283
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,960
I have rights, too. I'll find my own lawyer.

284
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,365
Rufus, he has a whole life

285
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,730
that we are not a part of.

286
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,600
Think of someone other than yourself.

287
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,280
What if I try to get in touch

288
00:13:06,315 --> 00:13:07,930
with the adoptive parents?

289
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,345
I can't guarantee

290
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,800
If they're gonna want to talk to you,

291
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,600
But at least I can ask.

292
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,600
Please. tell them we're in town.

293
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,980
We can meet them immediately

294
00:13:16,015 --> 00:13:17,330
Wherever they want.

295
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,860
Yes, of course.

296
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,245
Are you sure this is

297
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,660
The best time for a flare-up of Chuck fever?

298
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,260
I'm having no such thing. we're just friends.

299
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,600
He's gone through a lot, and...

300
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,600
He needs someone to be there.

301
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,600
Anyway, you're the one who told me

302
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,560
To help him out in the first place.

303
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,630
Hey, what's up with "gossip girl"

304
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,460
Putting out a hit on Dan? excuse me?

305
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,580
Apparently, "gossip girl"

306
00:13:41,615 --> 00:13:42,660
Is looking for evidence

307
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,660
To prove that Dan's cheating on you.

308
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,330
Not that anyone else would

309
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:48,030
Ever want Dan Humphrey. No offense.

310
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,030
Wait, let me see that.

311
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,045
"nothing yet on 'lonely boy,'

312
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,030
But we did find out

313
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,230
"He brown bags it for lunch,

314
00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:55,400
And today's plat du jour?

315
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,400
"A tuna sandwich.

316
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,800
"Disgusting, but not enough for a conviction.

317
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,670
Keep digging, kiddies.

318
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:01,715
Tuna fish?

319
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,830
Why does he make it so hard for himself?

320
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,260
Blair, who did this?

321
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,730
I see they act alone now.

322
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,800
It's so hard finding obedient minions.

323
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,100
But right now I have to go get ready

324
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,730
For my absolutely nonromantic

325
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:16,330
Dinner with Chuck. Ta.

326
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,500
I'm thinking one paint can of gummy worms

327
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,500
And another of swedish fish.

328
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,860
Is this how you and Nate want to celebrate

329
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,965
Two months of dating

330
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,030
With all things gummy?

331
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,030
Is he dragging you to Chuck's brunch, too?

332
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,760
We're skipping. Nate says

333
00:14:32,795 --> 00:14:34,530
Our anniversary takes precedence.

334
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,530
Ooh! should I get squirrel nut zippers

335
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,130
Or some b.b. bat strawberry?

336
00:14:38,165 --> 00:14:39,700
I don't know. candy's candy.

337
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,760
Okay, enough.

338
00:14:40,795 --> 00:14:41,860
You've been walking around for days

339
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,800
With a storm cloud over your head.

340
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,800
What is going on? it's annoying.

341
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,365
I really can't talk about it.

342
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:46,900
Dan, clearly something's up.

343
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,800
So let me help you.

344
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,930
All right, well, if...

345
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,895
If I tell you, you

346
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,900
Can't say anything to anyone

347
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,295
Not Nate, not Jenny

348
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,730
Especially not Jenny. No one.

349
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,300
- You swear? - Swear.

350
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,545
Swear on your simple machines 7 inches.

351
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,760
Bastard. fine. swear. spill.

352
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,295
You know that trip to boston

353
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,930
My dad and Lily are on?

354
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,600
Uh, they... they are...

355
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,730
They are looking for their son.

356
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,500
What do you mean, "son"?

357
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,415
I mean their child, the one tha

358
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,300
They had together 19 years ago.

359
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,160
What?!

360
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,230
Okay, first of all, lower your voice.

361
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,195
What are you talking about?

362
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,315
Lily gave the child up for adoption

363
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,400
And dad never knew.

364
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,400
Now I can't say anything to Serena

365
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,760
Because Lily wants to be the one to tell her.

366
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,925
I can't believe you're telling me this

367
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,015
Now in a candy store.

368
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,730
Well, you begged me to, so please help me.

369
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Here. okay. sorry.

370
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,345
For starters, stop avoiding her

371
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,530
Or you're gonna wind up

372
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,160
Ruining your relationship all on your own.

373
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,415
So unfortunately

374
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,700
That means you go to Chuck Bass' brunch.

375
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,960
Oh, no. how could you do it?

376
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,800
How could you cheat on Serena again?

377
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:57,600
I didn't.

378
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,330
Brooklyn pig.

379
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,995
How could you let him do it, v.?

380
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,630
You know who I am?

381
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,830
Please. dating Nate archibald

382
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,830
After striking out with Dan Humphrey?

383
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,310
Talk about failing upwards.

384
00:16:09,345 --> 00:16:10,760
Who are you cheating with?

385
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,630
Nobody. I'm not ch-- no, I-I'm not.

386
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,660
I'm not doing this again. I can't deal with this.

387
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,560
You, stay. I'll catch up in a minute.

388
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,930
All right.

389
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,460
I hope you don't mind. I let myself in.

390
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,100
I've made my decision, Jack.

391
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,030
I know.

392
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,560
And I owe you an apology.

393
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,700
The fact is, you're Bart's son, and it is your rightful place.

394
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,080
Your blessing means a lot to me.

395
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:47,430
Good. Now before we start spooning,

396
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,990
I want to take you out tonight to properly celebrate.

397
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:51,500
I'm having dinner with Blair.

398
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,495
Reschedule Blair.

399
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,000
I can't. She's been a good friend to me.

400
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,160
Yeah, I saw you two talking this morning.

401
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,500
The last time I had a friend like that,

402
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,930
- I wind up with gonorrhea. - Suprax?

403
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,930
Rocephin. I mean, Is this who you imagined Chuck Bass to be--

404
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,560
A man who spends his day at the office

405
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,000
And then goes home to the wife? it's no coincidence

406
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,160
Your father had his most success when he was single.

407
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,160
I, uh, invited a few friends to join us.

408
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,300
I guess I'll have to entertain them on my own.

409
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,100
Last chance.

410
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,630
What's it gonna be, Chuck-- business and Blair

411
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,160
Or cocktails and coquettes?

412
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,360
Serena, hey.

413
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,030
Hey. I just dropped Dan off at the loft if you--

414
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,230
Oh, no. I came to see you.

415
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,260
I'm here on a rather pathetic mission.

416
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,930
I'm boyfriend snooping.

417
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,930
- I see. yeah,  - it's not something I'm proud of,

418
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,930
But i-i don't know what else to do.

419
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,060
Something's going on with Dan,

420
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,660
And I thought I knew what it was, but i-i don't.

421
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,230
I was wondering if he said anything to you.

422
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,660
No, he didn't. I'm sorry.

423
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,460
Oh, I figured if--

424
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,930
If he would've told anyone, he would have told you.

425
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,660
Um, whatever it is, I'm sure he'll tell you.

426
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,130
Dan's not really one for keeping secrets.

427
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,130
Yeah, I-I... I used to think that,

428
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,700
But, um... I-I don't know anymore.

429
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,760
Okay.

430
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,830
Well, thanks anyway.

431
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,860
Bye.

432
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,530
When R Lily & Rufus back?

433
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,530
S need to know their child

434
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,860
You stole Dan Humphrey's phone?

435
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,860
Not bad, Nelly.

436
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,830
At this rate,You'll be off probation

437
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,430
Before your second marriage.

438
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,260
Is that candy?

439
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,330
When R Lily & Rufus back? S need to know their child

440
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,030
It's not fair

441
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,060
Lily and Rufus are their parents.

442
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,560
- What child is she talking about?  - it--it can't. I mean, that's...

443
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,330
Oh, my god. make that your first marriage.

444
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,930
From Chunk Bass Sorry, working late. Next time

445
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,860
Looks like Chuck Bass made his choice.

446
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,560
But careful, Bass. now that you're a big fish,

447
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,760
There are a lot more sharks in this pond.

448
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,330
I can't even pretend to read this anymore.

449
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,560
How long are we gonna sit around here waiting?

450
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,760
Hasn't even been 24 hours yet.

451
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,660
Just give it a chance.

452
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,530
Yeah, but they may not make a decision for days.

453
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,530
I've already missed the reading of Bart's will.

454
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,000
Hello?

455
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,500
Yes.

456
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,230
She's right here.

457
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,260
And what did they say?

458
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,460
Well, did you tell 'em we're not looking for anything,

459
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,360
Just a conversation?

460
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,360
Yes, well, I'm sorry, too.

461
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,930
They don't want to meet.

462
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,560
They don't want us to contact them... ever.

463
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,030
- Rufus - well, that's it, then. I guess I'll go back.

464
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,000
Who are those people?

465
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,700
Members of the board of Bass industries.

466
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,530
Jack wanted Chuck to be able to get to know them

467
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,525
In a more casual setting.

468
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,900
so how was your non-date with Chuck last night?

469
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,900
He had to reschedule.

470
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,760
Spare me those expressive eyebrows.

471
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,500
- I can't wait till you get botox.  - I'm just saying--

472
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,830
You're just saying nothing.

473
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,500
Chuck is taking this really seriously,

474
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,700
And I'm proud of him. end of story.

475
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,700
This is Jack. he's pulling up with Chuck.

476
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,100
Now you'll see we're just friends.

477
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,100
Dan, it's okay. whatever's going on with you and Serena,

478
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,525
It's still good that you came.

479
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,930
And you know I wouldn't pass up an opportunity

480
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,065
To celebrate Chuck Bass.

481
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,100
exactly. um, I'm gonna go find Eric,

482
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,230
But text me if you need any moral support.

483
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,930
I can't. I lost my phone. I'm stuck with dad's old cell.

484
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,500
It practically has a rotary dial.

485
00:21:49,535 --> 00:21:51,500
wow. well, good luck.

486
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,400
Hey! you came.

487
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,460
I love brunch. you had waffles and eggs

488
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,930
And little kipper-looking things in the same spot.

489
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,230
- I-i love this meal. it's perfect.  - I know.

490
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,300
Not to mention you're here. uh, I'd be crazy not to come.

491
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,900
Excuse me. please be quiet.

492
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,760
Chuck and his uncle Jack are on their way up.

493
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,800
Where's Chuck?

494
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,060
Relax. he's in his office.

495
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,570
I don't know how much he'll get done after the night we had.

496
00:22:32,605 --> 00:22:34,160
What? I thought that he was working.

497
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,830
Blair? we need to talk to you. it's important.

498
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,215
We put a hit on Dan Humphrey on "gossip girl"--

499
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,900
Why are you bothering me about "gossip girl" right now?

500
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,900
Go! we wanted your okay before we release what we have.

501
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,430
Fine. whatever. release it.

502
00:22:43,465 --> 00:22:44,930
go breathe somewhere else.

503
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,230
Bombs away, girls.

504
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,220
What do you mean Chuck was out with you last night?

505
00:22:52,255 --> 00:22:53,600
Jack, where's our guest of honor?

506
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:56,460
Pete, alice, glad you could make it.

507
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,960
Blair, this is pete holmberg, alice cashman,

508
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,315
Members of Bass industries' board.

509
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,630
Nice to meet you.

510
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,530
Chuck's hard at work upstairs, actually.

511
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,860
You should go see him. Perhaps Blair could show you the way.

512
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,500
Gladly.

513
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,930
So... what do you and jonathan want to do tonight?

514
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,900
Actually, uh, jonathan and i

515
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,060
Were thinking of just hanging out tonight,

516
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,500
Just the-- just the two of us.

517
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,260
Oh, okay.

518
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,200
Come on, Jenny. we hang out with you all the time.

519
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,060
So? don't act like you're doing me some big favor.

520
00:23:30,095 --> 00:23:31,300
Okay, you're acting ridiculous.

521
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,300
Me? I wasn't gonna say anything,

522
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,300
But ever since you started dating jonathan,

523
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,860
It's like, "my boyfriend this and my boyfriend that."

524
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,330
It's okay, we get it. You have a boyfriend

525
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:40,760
but-- yes, I do, and I'm sorry that you don't,

526
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:41,400
But it doesn't mean

527
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,065
I have to invite you out every time we have plans.

528
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,700
You are so conceited.

529
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,700
You are so annoying.

530
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,660
So, uh, my question--

531
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,660
And it's been bothering me for a while--

532
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,360
Can you reserve eclairs?

533
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,360
I know. cruel, right? why--why put them out?

534
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,630
I'm so glad you came. mm-hmm.

535
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,460
What now, people? it's not like I brought a tuna sandwich.

536
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,660
Hold on to your floppy cable-knit hats, kids.

537
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,460
Lonely boy's secret is out, and this one's a doozy.

538
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,960
D. wasn't cheating,

539
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,660
But there's definitely a third party involved.

540
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,060
Seems d. and s. share a sibling.

541
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,730
While I'm always a fan of star-crossed lovers,

542
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,860
At least romeo and juliet didn't share d.n.a.

543
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,200
Chuck.

544
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,260
That is Chuck Bass?

545
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,100
Yeah. who the hell are you?

546
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:16,060
Pete holmberg. I'm on the board of Bass industries.

547
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,100
Oh, Chuck, didn't your father teach you?

548
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,960
Never mix business with pleasure.

549
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:33,160
This can't be true. I need you to tell me this isn't true.

550
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,630
And you knew.

551
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,960
What the hell?

552
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,520
Look, I didn't realize you were going to be here. clearly.

553
00:26:07,555 --> 00:26:09,460
We knew this was your reputation.

554
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,860
When we learned your father had left you the company,

555
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,560
We had hoped he knew something we didn't.

556
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,200
Apparently, that is not the case.

557
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,560
I don't know what bart was thinking.

558
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,760
How could you?

559
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,960
Did you do all this?

560
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,830
What?

561
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,430
Throw you a brunch?

562
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,430
Try to do something nice, supportive? yes.

563
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,600
I don't need your help. stop trying to play the wife.

564
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,730
Serena, please.

565
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,000
Look, my dad made me promise not to say anything.

566
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,000
Your mom wanted to tell you herself, okay?

567
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,530
That's why I was avoiding you before. i-i couldn't bear

568
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,000
To be around you if I couldn't be honest with you.

569
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,325
I'm--i'm sorry. I'm so sorry. okay.

570
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,000
No, I get it, okay? i-i just don't und--

571
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:02,000
We should probably call them now and let them know that you know.

572
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:04,160
Don't. just--not yet.

573
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,830
Is that why they're in boston?

574
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:11,130
Yeah.

575
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,700
Is this true?

576
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,230
Yeah.

577
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,930
Yeah, it is.

578
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,430
Well, I guess it makes sense that we fight like siblings.

579
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,830
Yeah. look, it's obviously a lot to absorb,

580
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,030
But I think we should wait until we get all the facts.

581
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,860
Serena.

582
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,360
Dan, i-i'm sorry.

583
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,700
I just need some time to process this... alone.

584
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,000
Oh, hey. I was just gonna call down

585
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,000
And have our car brought around.

586
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,315
I don't think I'm ready to go.

587
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,600
Rufus.

588
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,730
What, Lily? the family could change their mind.

589
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,730
We should write them a letter

590
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,640
And explain that we just want to meet the boy.

591
00:27:58,675 --> 00:27:59,900
The parents don't want that.

592
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:03,460
What about what I want? this works out well for you.

593
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,460
You don't want to meet your son.

594
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,460
Oh. you don't think I haven't thought about this boy

595
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,100
Every day of his life?

596
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,060
You want to meet him.

597
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,060
Have you thought about what happens after that?

598
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,630
What if we find out he's had a horrible life?

599
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:23,100
Or what if we instantly love him,

600
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:27,200
And then it's very clear that we've made a terrible mistake?

601
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:30,730
My only fear is feeling like we failed to try everything.

602
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,960
Well, we can keep trying from new york.

603
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,105
We don't have to stay here.

604
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,280
why, not, lil? it's another day.

605
00:28:35,315 --> 00:28:36,330
Is that too much to ask?!

606
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,330
Yes. yes, it is, because this whole search has been

607
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,330
So excruciating, I don't want to go through it anymore.

608
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,330
I don't want to spend another day, yet another minute,

609
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,330
Trapped in this hotel room,

610
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,830
Scared that you're gonna hate me forever,

611
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,460
When I'm still in love with you.

612
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,400
Lily.

613
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,330
I just can't believe you--you don't remember.

614
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,860
It--it was our first show in Paris...

615
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,960
And you decided to stand on the front of the stage...

616
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,530
No. and then you got really mad

617
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,260
Because the drummer from buffalo Tom groped you. no?

618
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,360
- No. you- -no? okay. now you're starting to scare me.

619
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,800
I just can't believe we were in Paris together,

620
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:33,530
And we spent the entire time in a dirty club in marais.

621
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,030
Maybe we should go back, do it again.

622
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,160
Oh, I would love that.

623
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,730
Me, too.

624
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,760
Hello?

625
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,500
Yeah, this is he.

626
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,330
All right. thank you.

627
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,300
Thank you so much.

628
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,700
That was Chris Rosson, the adoptive father. mm-hmm.

629
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:12,000
He doesn't want his wife to know,

630
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,560
But he wants to meet with us.

631
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,660
You're my only family.

632
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,660
How could you do this to me?

633
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,660
You did it to yourself.

634
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,930
Clearly, I was right, but you aren't ready.

635
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,330
You have your own life, your own company.

636
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,230
Sure. in Australia.

637
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,230
My dear brother literally placed me

638
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,730
On the other side of the world.

639
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,330
I did everything right.

640
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,330
I ran that place without complaint,

641
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,900
And it thrived under my watch.

642
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,230
And this is how he repays me?

643
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,230
By giving the company to a teenager

644
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,230
Who can't keep his pecker in his pants for 24 hours?

645
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,230
At least I can keep mine in service

646
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,120
- For longer than five minutes. - You can have that.

647
00:31:09,155 --> 00:31:10,230
I'll take Bass industries.

648
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,500
It's not yours to take. my father gave it to me.

649
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,300
Actually...

650
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:21,060
There is one stipulation attached to your appointment--

651
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,460
Morality clause.

652
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,960
Bart knew his son.

653
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,660
He specified that should you in any way act inappropriately,

654
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,360
The board has the option to replace you

655
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,560
With your legal guardian,

656
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,360
Which--wouldn't you know it? is me.

657
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,500
I already talked to the board.

658
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,660
I'm in charge now.

659
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,000
Are you sure you're okay with this?

660
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,300
Yes. yes, it's time.

661
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,060
Thanks.

662
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,460
Mr. Humphrey? Miss Bass?

663
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,200
Yes. it's uh, so--so nice to meet you.

664
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,200
Thank you so much for calling us.

665
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,560
Uh. please, sit down.

666
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:22,060
I have something I have to tell you.

667
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,260
Can I, um,

668
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,130
Can I come in?

669
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,430
Have you, uh, have you spoken to mom yet?

670
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,730
No. it went straight to voice mail.

671
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,800
Yeah, me, too. are you okay?

672
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,400
Not really.

673
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,930
I'm so mad at her for keeping this from us,

674
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,300
But at the same time, I feel incredibly sad for her

675
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,730
And Rufus.

676
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,260
Yeah, I know. sounds like it's got grandma written all over it.

677
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,660
It reeks of gin and chanel no. five.

678
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,330
It is so weird that we have a half...

679
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,560
Something.

680
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,560
And so do Dan and Jenny.

681
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,230
Are you and Dan gonna be okay?

682
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,700
I don't know.

683
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,160
I had enough trouble

684
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,930
With the idea of mom and Rufus dating,

685
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,930
But now I share a sibling with my boyfriend?

686
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,130
That's--that's a little more hillbilly than I can handle.

687
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,360
It is a little twisted. but so what, right?

688
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,100
Well, what if we can't get past it?

689
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,330
I don't know.

690
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,530
But you can't push Dan away right now.

691
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,530
Whatever you are going through,

692
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,700
He's going through the same thing.

693
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,730
Oh. hey. I was just, uh, I was looking for Vanessa.

694
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,360
Oh, she's just in the back. she's getting ready.

695
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,860
We're about to, uh, about to head out.

696
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,360
That's right. your anniversary.

697
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,300
Yeah. you wanna wait?

698
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:00,060
Um, no. just tell her I came by.

699
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,400
Okay.

700
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,500
Dan, Dan, hey.

701
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,260
I saw the blast, and I know what you're going through.

702
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,600
Really? you found out you and your girlfriend

703
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,730
Share a sibling you never knew you had?

704
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,130
Well, uh, no. at least not yet.

705
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,730
But hey, I do know what it's like

706
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,760
To have the most painful details

707
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,100
Of your personal life made public.

708
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,130
Yeah.

709
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,130
Yeah, it kind of blows.

710
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,400
And i-i-i know it feels like nothing good can come of it.

711
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,330
Going through all of that,

712
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,330
I found out who my real friends were.

713
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,900
Yeah. well, I mean, she-- vanessa really cares about you.

714
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:40,560
I was actually talking about you.

715
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,360
And I'm...

716
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,860
I'm really sorry about what happened

717
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:51,860
-I never meant --oh, you know what? it's--it's okay.

718
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,900
I mean, this whole thing has actually made me nostalgic

719
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:56,900
For the days when Jenny was the problem.

720
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,430
Speaking of which, I should go check on her.

721
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,300
I mean, today's been tough on her, obviously.

722
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:06,760
-Uh, uh, tell v. that I came by. - Yes, I-I will, man. sure.

723
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,560
-Thanks. -bye.

724
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,600
It was last year.

725
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,600
Andrew was sailing with some friends.

726
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,600
They jumped in the water.

727
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:24,360
Andrew got caught in a riptide.

728
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,830
We're so sorry. um...

729
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,360
Yeah, if we had known, we...

730
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,260
Wouldn't have even bothered you.

731
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,030
It's my wife.

732
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,060
She's had trouble with it.

733
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,960
It was too painful for her to tell you,

734
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,860
Because, uh...

735
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,960
Well, it's too painful for her to tell anyone.

736
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,000
This is from the newspaper.

737
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,930
Um, I just need to know.

738
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,560
Was he happy?

739
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,360
Very.

740
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,400
He always had a smile on his face from the beginning.

741
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,860
I'm sorry.

742
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,130
I screwed up.

743
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,830
It's too late, Chuck.

744
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,330
I have stood by you through all of this,

745
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,030
But I can't watch you self-destruct any longer.

746
00:36:51,065 --> 00:36:52,700
Jack set me up.

747
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,700
There's no one to blame but yourself.

748
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:57,530
I believed in you.

749
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:02,060
Your father believed in you.

750
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,100
You...

751
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:06,160
Are the only one who didn't.

752
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,660
All I wanted to do was...

753
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,560
Just be there.

754
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,230
But today, when you called me your wife,

755
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,760
You made it sound like the ugliest word in the world.

756
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,830
Blair... please.

757
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,700
I'm sorry...

758
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,160
But I'm done.

759
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,000
Have you, um, talked to Serena?

760
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:13,000
Uh, no, and i-i don't expect to anytime soon.

761
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,300
Okay.

762
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:17,360
Well, I say we could both use a distraction,

763
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,030
So I say we play boggle or watch a trashy movie.

764
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,060
- I rented "showgirls." - Oh, no, boggle.

765
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,650
I don't think I can sit through "showgirls" again.

766
00:38:24,685 --> 00:38:27,200
again? seriously?

767
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,560
Okay, so are we really not gonna talk about it?

768
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,430
No.

769
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,630
You know, and-- and the worst part of it was

770
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,630
That all I wanted to do was spend every minute with you.

771
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,680
I-i couldn't because I had to keep this huge secret.

772
00:38:49,715 --> 00:38:50,630
Well, it's--it's okay.

773
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,130
I--i wouldn't have known what to do either.

774
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,160
You know, i... through all this,

775
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,900
I-i had so many thoughts going through my head,

776
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:01,030
But the one that kept popping up again and again...

777
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,530
What--what does this mean for us?

778
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:11,360
I don't know, but--but we'll figure it out.

779
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,930
Because I know no matter what, I want to be with you.

780
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,060
Me, too.

781
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,030
And there's gotta be some kind of precedent for this, right?

782
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,030
Yeah. yeah. there's got-- in literature.

783
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,360
Uh, toni morrison, maybe,

784
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,860
Flannery o'connor...

785
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,230
The--the russian aristocrats,

786
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,260
Before they all became hemophiliacs...

787
00:39:31,295 --> 00:39:32,260
or "clueless."

788
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,280
Alicia silverstone's character

789
00:39:33,315 --> 00:39:34,260
dated her ex-stepbrother,

790
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,730
And they made it work. that's super skeevy.

791
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,330
Thank you. that makes me feel so much better.

792
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,500
-I'm really... -no, I'm s--

793
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,460
Sorry. there. I said it first. ha ha. -thanks.

794
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,560
But, uh, I really should be the one to apologize.

795
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,350
I mean, you have every right to

796
00:39:55,385 --> 00:39:57,100
want to be alone with jonathan.

797
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,495
Yeah, but it doesn't mean you get on my nerves...

798
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,860
that much.

799
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,460
It's okay. I want to get on your nerves.

800
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,630
-Oh, really? -uh, yeah. that's what family does.

801
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,595
Hey, can we get some sandwiches?

802
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,600
sure. two p.b. and j. coming right up.

803
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,760
The problem with inheritance is

804
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,630
That it's not always as simple as it sounds.

805
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:33,600
Sometimes you get more than you bargained for...

806
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,260
Is it over?

807
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,560
They won't be back.

808
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,560
I feel awful.

809
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,000
We had to do it. they have money, lawyers.

810
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,660
They wouldn't have stopped.

811
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,180
We've already lost one son.

812
00:40:47,215 --> 00:40:48,660
We weren't losing another.

813
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:56,230
Or you discover that in gaining one thing,

814
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,200
You've lost something else.

815
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,830
You know, I guess the idea of this child

816
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,400
Always made me feel connected to you,

817
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,830
And...

818
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,060
I guess...

819
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,100
A part of me never gave up

820
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,260
On the idea that we would

821
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,530
Finally come together eventually.

822
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,030
But...

823
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,960
Maybe we weren't meant to be a family.

824
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,160
But every once in a while, the fates smile upon you

825
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,960
And you get the one thing you really need.

826
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,030
X.o.x.o., gossip girl.
