(gossip girl) gossip girl 
here--your one and only source

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,570
into the scandalous lives
 of manhattan's elite.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,230
girl was right. i'm gay.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,380
every time mom brought home someone who
said,"i love you," they would end up married.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,290
i'm not ashamed of who i am. i may have
concealed things in the past,but not anymore.

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,080
the bad news is that your
girlfriend catherine is

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,610
a lying,manipulating whore
who's sleeping with her stepson.

8
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,520
the good news is that i
convinced them both to leave town.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,030
what do you care about humdrum
humphrey anyway? he's nothing.

10
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,390
i actually think he's pretty cool.

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,880
the only personwith fewer friends
than you is dan humphrey,and that's

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,400
because he's something
you'll never be-a human being.

22
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,520
why are you all so quiet?

23
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,530
good morning.

24
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,160
bart,you're back early.
my last round of meetings

25
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,420
wrapped up sooner than expected.
rushing home to the family.

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,580
how long's this layover?

27
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,500
didn't lily tell you? i'm
here for the long haul.

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,080
and just in time for our
housewarming party tomorrow night.

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,190
um,i've been meaning to ask you.

30
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,970
uh,can we bring friends? of course,dear.

31
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,150
oh,um,did you get the little
suit that i laid out for you,

32
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,100
serena? that was for me?

33
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,130
i thought the housekeepers
got new uniforms.

34
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,960
yeah,it's conservative,yes,but classic.

35
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,110
bart brought it from paris. it
had its own seat on his plane.

36
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,580
bart bought me a suit? newatch.

37
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,330
cash-direct deposit into
one of my offshore accounts.

38
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,730
now that we are all here,

39
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,100
lily and i have something
we want to discuss.

40
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,740
as tomorrow's party marks
our debut as a family,

41
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,820
we've been talking about
what that actually means.

42
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,030
less money for me when you die?

43
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,710
we were thinking more along
the lines of some guidelines.

44
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,750
guidelines? for what?

45
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,050
for life together. i
mean,now that we're all here,

46
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,350
having some rules would
be nice. like what?

47
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,530
like every friday,we dine as a family.
uh,don't you think monday would be-

48
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,740
a ekend curfew of 1:00 a.m.
is that eastern or pacific?

49
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,230
and no going out on school nights. what?

50
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,250
are you serious? all right,all right.

51
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,210
mom,where is this coming from? bart
and me. we made the decision together.

52
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,480
we are in complete agreement
on this matter. yeah

53
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,020
,i'm sure

54
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,830
.medicine cabinet,bedside
table,underwear drawer?

55
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,480
it's borderline
solicitation,v.,and-and,uh,creepy.

56
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,580
it wouldn't be creepy if
you'd actually read the flyer.

57
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,920
you're on a missionto save dutch
schultz's favorite speakeasy.

58
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,640
but what are you protesting?
the-the owner died,didn't he?

59
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,710
he did,which is why the whole
building's up for auction.

60
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,180
and if we don't stop the
sale,it won't be long before

61
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,260
some evil developer turns it into
a pain quotidien. oh,i like le pain-

62
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,310
okay,we're doing a petition for
landmark status... uh,which you signed

63
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,920
and dad signed and mom signed...

64
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,390
and-and eleanor waldorf. how
about i come to school with you

65
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,800
and hand out flyers to the guilty
rich? well,if there is such a thing,

66
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,590
i d-i don't think there's any in my school.
well,maybe one of their mommies or daddies

67
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,700
is looking for their next cause. hmm.

68
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:13,870
whose bag is that? that's a soccer ball.
oh,yeah,apparently,half the soccer team at st jude's

69
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,830
got mono from making out
with lauren goldenberg... ew.

70
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,820
so i-i guess their only other
option was to ask me to try out.

71
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,770
wait. they asked you?

72
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,060
yeah,well,nate did.
i'm now an alternate.

73
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,120
i'm also really,really late.

74
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,880
uh,you with me?

75
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,910
yeah.

76
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,100
well,uh,good luck with
the guiltless rich.

77
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,110
what's next,no tv until after you finish your
homework? they're just a few rules,serena.

78
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,060
who watches tv on a tv anymore anyway?

79
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,570
it's not about the
rules,eric. it's about mom.

80
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,090
when it's just the
three of us,it's fine,

81
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,760
but anytime she gets a
new guy,she stepfords out

82
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,460
and lets him make all the decisions.
i don't think that's what's happening.

83
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,980
remember when we had to move to chamonix

84
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,090
because german klaus wanted to ski
all year round? that wasn't so bad.

85
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,300
but what about paolo-

86
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,750
the raw food diet? family colonics?

87
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,560
or sameer? i know i enjoyed our

88
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,750
i see what you mean. look,mom can't
let these guys choose her life for her

89
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,170
because they shouldn't
be able to choose ours.

90
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,890
it seems different this time.

91
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,210
she seems pretty serious

92
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,380
about making the whole
family thing work with bart.

93
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,750
we could at least try,right? fine.

94
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,290
but the second he
starts to call the shots,

95
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,660
these gloves come off
and the nails come out.

96
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,710
i just mixed metaphors,didn't
i? yeah,but it kind of worked.

97
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,980
and the coach is really impressed
with your tryouts. really?

98
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,430
<i>yeah. thanks for subbing in. well,save
your thanks until after you see me play.</i>

99
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,550
it's gonna be
- humphrey,never a pleasure.

100
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:41,970
oh,good. we agree on something. archibald,isn't
it about time you ended this bromance?

101
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,070
what happens at yale stays at yale.

102
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,500
hey,man. let's go.

103
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,570
poor chuck. what is life
without a friend to share it?

104
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,690
oh,it looks like you just
lost yours to dan humphrey.

105
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,280
who cares? i'd rather talk about
who you lost yours to anyway.

106
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,460
been there,done
that,been decontaminated.

107
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,420
we both know you'll do it again.
it's jt a question of when.

108
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,710
the answer is never.

109
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,480
we're inevitable,waldorf.

110
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,400
despite whatever vestigial attraction

111
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,420
my body may feel for
you,my brain knows better.

112
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,360
and yours should,too. i gotta go.

113
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,400
i've got a disciplinary hearing. well,i
knew you were trouble,but a hearing?

114
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,010
impressive.

115
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,720
oh,it's not for me.

116
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,150
kelsey,kelsey,kelsey,how
many times must we tell you?

117
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,850
as one of the girls of the steps,

118
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,360
you represent constance royalty.
so it should come as no surprise

119
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,830
that many girls before
you have gotten the ax

120
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,270
when their choices
reflected poorly on us.

121
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,750
i didn't realize
- that tights are not pants?

122
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,090
honestly. blair,you got a minute?

123
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,380
60 seconds. clock it.

124
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,670
what are y doing here with those?

125
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,040
shouldn't you be at whole foods?

126
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,210
as much as i hate these
words coming out of my mouth,

127
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,390
i could really use your help
with this. oh,saving a teardown.

128
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,450
charity is for diseases
and endangered species.

129
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,920
real estate is not on the
list,at least not in new york.

130
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,450
i can make you help me,you know?

131
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,370
oh,it makes jokes,too.

132
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,360
everyone knows that
you and marcus broke up,

133
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,920
but no one knows why.

134
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,180
even you wouldn't stoop that low.

135
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,270
blackmail seems to work so well for you,

136
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,990
so maybe i'm missing out.

137
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,540
now that we've
established that i own you,

138
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,540
you have six hours to
get a thousand signatures

139
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,650
and make sure they're legible. have fun.

140
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,600
well,well. look who's
playing by the rules,

141
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,570
and it's not even a school night.
eric convinced me. what about you?

142
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,440
i'm on my way out to a house call.

143
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,830
ugh. gross.

144
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,040
well,as long as you're home by 1:00.

145
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,620
naive serena.

146
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,420
don't you know bart and lil's
list rules doesn't apply to me?

147
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,050
what are you talking about?
according to my sources,

148
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,190
the real reason my
father flew back early

149
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,900
is to court some executives
in town from the midwest.

150
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,210
the only problem
is,they won't do business

151
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,500
with anyone who doesn't
share their family values,

152
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,350
so bart is making sure we do...

153
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,370
or appear to.

154
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,140
wait. all this just
so he can close a deal?

155
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,430
i do my best work off the radar,

156
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,630
but while you're on "page six"

157
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,970
with the poppy liftons of the world,

158
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,200
you're the bigger threat
to bart's business.

159
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,200
night,sis.

160
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,790
i hope your book is captivating.

161
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,850
hi,bart.

162
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,340
we missed you at family
dinner. maybe next time.

163
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,700
where do you think you're
going,and in that dress?

164
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,930
oh,the girls and i thought we'd
hit up 10ak,then maybe bijoux,

165
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,780
and i don't know-anywhere
we can find some paparazzi.

166
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,030
i'm in the mood for
a little show tonight.

167
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,840
oh,i forgot to put on underwear.

168
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,140
waving a white flag,are we?

169
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,450
not exactly.

170
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,330
i have a proposition for you.

171
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,550
i'll say yes. that little troll
vanessa is working my last nerve.

172
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:38,720
not what i expected. and then i
realized this could benefit both of us.

173
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,300
you had me until "troll."

174
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,210
dan stole your best friend.
now you can steal his.

175
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,360
seduce and destroy.

176
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,220
what's in it for me? the
thrill of the impossible.

177
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,200
the only person vanessa
loathes more than me is you.

178
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,850
it would be one for the ages.

179
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,640
maybe you're not up for it.

180
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,680
if memory serves,you've had
some mechanical problems.

181
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,930
i'll just imagine she's you.

182
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,260
<i>this just in...</i>

183
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,680
<i>blair waldorf and chuck bass</i>

184
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,910
<i>placing a wager on the
takedown of lonely boy's b.f.f.</i>

185
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,640
<i>we think we've heard this story before,</i>

186
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,490
<i>and we're pretty sure it
ended up with everyone dead.</i>

187
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,470
so what did lily have to say about
last night's curfew flaunting?

188
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,030
mm,i kind of snuck out
before s could corner me.

189
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,640
let them discipline the sibling that
actually deserves it. you mean chuck?

190
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,700
what? you smiled.

191
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,220
no,i didn't. i hate chuck.
don't make me lose my appetite.

192
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,730
oh,hey. is that eric?c?

193
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,940
hey,uh,larissa said you'd be here.

194
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,190
hey. and we are? who is this?

195
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,190
jonathan,this is my sister,serena,

196
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,200
and her friend,blair waldorf.

197
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,470
this is jonathan,my boyfriend.

198
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,740
it's nice to meet you both. nice work,e.

199
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,860
oh,my gosh. hi. so nice to meet you.

200
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,190
sit down,both of you.

201
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,530
i invited him to the party tonight,

202
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,730
but i thought you should meet him
first. yeah,i met chuck the other day.

203
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,790
chuck. wow. hear that,blair?

204
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,850
chuck.

205
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,520
ignore her. she's dehydrated.

206
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,540
did i miss something? no,but we did-

207
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,130
the story of how you two met.
we want to know everything.

208
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,750
so then the ball came to me,

209
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,830
and so i kicked it to this
guy,and then-and then,you know,

210
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,710
he kicked it to another guy,an
he kicked it to another guy

211
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,550
and then that guy scored,

212
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,320
so,you know,it was
basically an assist. wow.

213
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,330
yeah,it was awesome. it was pretty amazing.
oh,it's so weird that you're on a team now.

214
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,140
i mean,pretty soon you're gonna have aual
guy friends. what are you talking about?

215
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,160
i have plenty of guy friends. dan,i
know that you're mr. soccer now,

216
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,920
but you and i both know you
prefer to hang out with girls.

217
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,460
vanessa,serena,once upon a time.

218
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,060
it's nothingo be ashamed of.
except that it's completely untrue.

219
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,400
okay. dad,will you please tell
jenny that-that i have guy friends?

220
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,760
of course he does. i'm his
- no,not including you.

221
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,610
or cedric? not including dolls.

222
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,760
okay,watch and learn.

223
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,480
nate. hey,man. hey,it's humphrey. dan.

224
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,840
yeah,good. good. hey,listen.

225
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,380
uh,you want to hook up
for some soccer later?

226
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,550
you're-you're- you're
by the park,right?

227
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,920
noon,yeah. sweet,bro.
all right. i love it. bye.

228
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,660
apparently,uh,we're
gonna play soccer later.

229
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,340
uh-huh. no big.

230
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,220
is cedric invited? jenny.

231
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,560
hmm. come on.

232
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,210
thank you,dad. you
know,cedric would get dirty.

233
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,440
and then dan would have to bathe him.

234
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,870
all right,i'll see you two later.

235
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,630
i got my boy waiting for me.

236
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,750
great turnout,v. i got a good feeling.

237
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,350
let's hope so,horace.

238
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,140
here come the sharks.

239
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,760
what the hell are you doing?
you mean you have to ask?

240
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,580
i'm here because of you.
thank you for introducing me

241
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,280
to this unique business opportunity. no.
unh-unh. you are not buying this place

242
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,700
to turn it into another
yuppie fusion bar.

243
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,240
for your information,since
i bought vic9$ola,

244
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,750
bass industries has expanded
into vintage entertainment.

245
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,620
we're willing to work with you. thanks,but
we're already petitioning for landmark status.

246
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,640
why don't you have a bake
sale while you're at it?

247
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,470
in the real world,we are your only hope.

248
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,980
endorse our bid,and we
promise to return this place

249
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,670
to all its sweet sordidness.

250
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:50,360
it sounds perfect. just
one problem-i know you.

251
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,780
or do you only think you do?
hey,get outta here,rich boy!

252
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,700
ooh! wow. i didn't think
that suit could get any worse.

253
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,010
i was wrong.

254
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,450
i think that's
- oh,serena,wait a minute.

255
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,190
would you excuse us,please? thank
you. so what's my punishment?

256
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,060
don't be childish. why not?
you're treating me like one.

257
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,640
isn't that who curfews are for? well,you're
certainly living up to our expectations.

258
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,260
according to bart,

259
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,090
you went out looking like
a stripper last night.

260
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,880
our rules,then just say so,

261
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,550
but to simply defy us... not you,him.

262
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,600
bart and i are husband and
wife. but he's not our father.

263
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,800
come on,mom.

264
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,480
things were so good last year.

265
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,040
we were almost like a real family.

266
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,260
why change that?

267
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,690
serena,you're making this much
more complicated than it really is,

268
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,190
and going by your actions last night,

269
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,390
i clearly think that you could
benefit from a little structure.

270
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,130
if i thought this was actually
you talking,i might listen.

271
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,980
if this is how you're acting now,

272
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,430
i should have insisted on
more structure years ago.

273
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,960
you mean,like,three husbands ago?

274
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,370
that was unkind.

275
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,320
i'm not really in a family mood.

276
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,660
i think i'm gonna pass on
tonight's little soiree.

277
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,170
nate?

278
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,070
hey,man.

279
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,370
oh,right,yeah,yeah,we're
meeting in the park.

280
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,680
yeah.

281
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,110
no,no,no. i just-
i got-i got tied up.

282
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,440
yeah,i'll see you in ten.

283
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,270
okay.

284
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,540
<i>whoever said,"you can't have it all,"</i>

285
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,990
<i>must have known the archibalds.</i>

286
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:41,960
<i>yuck. poor.</i>

287
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,420
a mr. chuck to see you,miss blair.

288
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,630
dorota,who?

289
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,620
excuse me. don't you-

290
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,540
deal's off. what? what
are you talking about?

291
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,760
i'm out. i don't know
what i was thinking about,

292
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,330
pretending to buy some broken-down
bar. but you promised to seduce vanessa.

293
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,390
she needs to be destroyed.

294
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,590
she's your problem. humphrey
doesn't warrant this.

295
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,210
the great chuck bass
is just gonna give up?

296
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,160
no,no,no. there's no shame
if the prize isn't worth it.

297
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,310
you can do your own dirty work.??

298
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,120
but what if i made it worth it?

299
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,300
what are you talking
about? i think you know.

300
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,740
you're not serious.

301
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,520
my,my.

302
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,710
<i>that girl has gotten under your skin.</i>

303
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,320
the question is,bass,will you?

304
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:38,480
aren't you the least
bit worried i'll succeed?

305
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,360
do we have an agreement?

306
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,790
<i>careful,b.</i>

307
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,750
<i>one thing about making
a deal with the devil...</i>

308
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,170
oh,we have a deal.

309
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,320
<i>he always comes to collect.</i>

310
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,380
after you left,

311
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,550
your lawyer came back and
showed us your proposal,

312
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:07,060
which did indeed include
keeping everything as is

313
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,850
and lobbying for landmark status.
so i was telling the truth.

314
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,580
i'm sure you've done
something in your lifetime

315
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,910
ng beaned by an iced beverage.

316
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,740
isn't it possible there are
parts of me you don't know?

317
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,160
possible,just extremely unlikely.

318
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,860
you have a reason for coming here?

319
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,940
if it was to insult me,

320
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,740
there's a web site you can go to. the
manager of the inn wants to meet you.

321
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,010
if he signs off,you have our support.

322
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,680
but it still doesn't mean i trust you.

323
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,860
of course not... now.

324
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,210
i best go put on something special.

325
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,720
i don't know how she expects
me to take this family seriously

326
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,170
when her record stands at 16
months. which husband was that?

327
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,180
klaus.

328
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,120
is that the one who wore
the wooden shoes? zip.

329
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,100
no,that was danish claus,with a "c."

330
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,040
this is german klaus,with a "k."

331
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,540
wait,i forget. did she marry
both? no,just german klaus,

332
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,780
but she did date danish
claus longer. oh,your mother.

333
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,710
remember how she always
used to just jet off

334
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,260
to mustique or ibiza without warning

335
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,770
while you and eric were still
in school? eleanor always knew

336
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:18,190
when we showed up with our overnight
bags. lily had a new boyfriend.

337
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,330
we tried alternating between
you and the archibalds

338
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,410
so you guys never knew how
bad it really was. we knew.

339
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,390
<i>but bart is the worst. he's
controlling and a pocrite.</i>

340
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,090
he acts like he's family friendly

341
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,260
when he's dated half
the models in manhattan.

342
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,060
b.,you look gorgeous. where
did you get that dress?

343
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,220
oh,this?

344
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,280
just... chuck.

345
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,600
when did chuck give you a dress?
when we were going to europe.

346
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,110
and you're wearing it tonight?

347
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,930
it's just that it would be a shame
to waste it. that's all. uh-huh.

348
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,130
you know,you gotta
teach me that-that,uh,

349
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,770
that bouncing-off-the-knees
thing,

350
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,430
'cause i tried it once,but
i broke my dad's gibson.

351
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:56,760
it's very scarring to see your father
cry. well,i actually wouldn't know.

352
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,980
my father-not too big
on showing emotion. mm.

353
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,260
hey,so i'm guessing you're not going

354
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,160
to the bass/van der
woodsen housewarming party,

355
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,420
are you,tonight? no,no.

356
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,640
um,well,especially since this
is the first i'm hearing of it.

357
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,010
oh,so... you and serena are,like...
well,to say things ended badly

358
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,260
would be an understatement. you going?

359
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,400
uh,nah. i think i'm
just gonna stay at home,

360
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,870
chill out,watch a movie,you
know? yeah,that sounds good.

361
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,170
well,i'd actually invite you over,

362
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,500
but the house is,like,a
total mess. oh,yeah. no.

363
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,370
housekeeper has the week off,so... is your
mom there? i mean,not that she cleans things.

364
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:31,590
you know,i-i-i don't know... all that
stuff with your dad... yeah. no,it's,uh...

365
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,470
my mom's staying out
in the hamptons... okay.

366
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,730
so i told her i was staying
at chuck's just so she doesn't

367
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,970
worry about stuff,you know?

368
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,090
i'm gonna get a drink,actually.
you want something?

369
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,140
yeah. sure. thanks. cool.

370
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,270
what is it?

371
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,300
nothing. i like it.

372
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,240
this our guy?

373
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,010
horace rogers,meet chuck bass. pleasure.

374
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,420
man,come here.

375
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,650
look at that outfit.

376
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,320
didn't know it could be worse
than the one this morning.

377
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,870
kidding.

378
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,070
i know savile row when i see
it. joe kennedy taught me.

379
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,010
you knew joe kennedy? used
to come here all the time.

380
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,180
had a girl up the street.

381
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,510
i was 9 years old,selling
papers out front.

382
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,190
rumor has it

383
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,170
he kept this place in
booze during prohibition.

384
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,780
so you like old joe?

385
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,420
rumrunner,womanizer,millionaire.

386
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,630
he was my kind of guy.

387
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,070
they all used to come
here back in the day-

388
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:39,280
gangsters,fighters,9a musicians.

389
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,500
daerous folks,no doubt.

390
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,670
but they had style.

391
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,300
something tells me you'd fit right in.

392
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,130
that's possibly the nicest
thing anyone's ever said to me.

393
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,650
well,are you sure he's living there?

394
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,760
uh,squatting,i think,would
be the correct term.

395
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,310
there's just,like,

396
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,630
a sleeping bag and a bunch
of brooks brothers shirts.

397
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,960
<i>why isn't he staying with chuck?
well,obviously,dan,he's embarrassed.</i>

398
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,890
okay,look,invite him
over for dinner tonight.

399
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,230
dad's making chili.
and then once he's here,

400
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,680
we can convince him to stay. okay.
uh,don't-don't mention anything to dad,though,

401
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,020
'cause he'll probably,like,handcuff
him to the couch

402
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,580
or say something stupid. i'll see ya.

403
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,870
that was,uh,that was jenny. oh.

404
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,920
and it turns out my dad's
making his once-a-year chili,

405
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,420
and attendance is mandatory
for me and whoever i'm with.

406
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,710
i'm sorry. i'm deeply sorry.
but this year,that's you.

407
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,460
wow. well,i guess i don't
have a choice then,do i?

408
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,000
you don't.

409
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,530
uh,scattegories will be
involved. scattegories?

410
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,890
hey,jonathan. you visiting
eric? uh,he's not here.

411
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,970
i was just dropping off some books.
have fun tonight. uh,you're not coming?

412
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,670
no. eric talked to your stepfather,

413
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,100
and apparently it's family only.

414
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,600
wait,bart said that? it's no
big deal. i'll see you later.

415
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,050
well,you won horace over.

416
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,690
he trusts me.

417
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,950
you're really serious,aren't you?

418
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,320
you're gonna save this place.

419
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,310
yeah. i guess i am.

420
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,780
i knew it'd take a miracle,

421
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,010
but i never thought
it would be chuck bass.

422
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,770
i was wrong about you,

423
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,680
and i'm sorry.

424
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,530
thanks. means a lot.

425
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,150
vanessa,there's something...

426
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,870
at the conclusion of a deal,

427
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,300
i like to celebrate.

428
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,580
my parents are having
a housewarming tonight.

429
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,730
i'd like you to come. yeah,okay.

430
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,540
good. i'll send the car at 8:00.

431
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:13,330
RICHARD PHILLIPS,THIS IS ARIEL FOXMAN
AND HONOR BRODIE FROM "IN STYLE."

432
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,210
EVERYTHING HERE THAT YOU
SEE IS THANKS TO THEM.

433
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:20,160
<i>EXCEPT FOR THIS GORGEOUS PAINTING,</i>

434
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,630
WHICH RICHARD DID.

435
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,890
um,would you just
excuse us for one second?

436
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,480
i'll take care of it,lily. excuse me.

437
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,300
serena?

438
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,900
the suit looks lovely on you.

439
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,260
and i'm glad you changed your
mind and decided to join us.

440
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,810
can i introduce you to some people?
no,i'm waiting on some friends.

441
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,830
we are allowed to bring
friends,right? sure.

442
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,640
bart,just curious.

443
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,420
does mom know you told eric he
couldn't bring his boyfriend?

444
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,820
i told eric no such thing.

445
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,820
we discussed it. the decision was his.

446
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:01,110
really? the 15 year
old and the billionaire?

447
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,670
sounds like a discussion between equals.

448
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,760
serena,i hope that over time

449
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,140
you'll see that i want
what's best for this family.

450
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,830
in the meantime,i suggest
you talk with your brother.

451
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,880
good evening,chuck.

452
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,320
blair.

453
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,710
do i get a progress report?

454
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,390
does vanessa still think

455
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,290
you're buying that beer hall of hers?

456
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,770
i am buying it. it's a good investment.

457
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,340
you're kidding.

458
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,780
fine. but you're still
gonna crush her,right?

459
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,630
we made a deal,remember?

460
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,120
yes. excuse me.

461
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,350
some housewarming.

462
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,000
good thing i didn't bring a casserole.

463
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,260
can i get you a drink? chuck.

464
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,630
<i>i'd like to speak with you now.</i>

465
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,910
i'll be back in a moment.

466
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,250
so,jenny,i still can't believe

467
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,510
you dropped out of constance
to become a designer.

468
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,340
<i>um,it's incredible how
supportive my dad's been.</i>

469
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,150
by "incredible," she means "difficult
to believe." what about you,nate?

470
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:19,370
how's everything at home? i know
it's been a tough year. yeah,it has,

471
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,450
but,you know,we're getting by.
it's just you and your mom now?

472
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,460
uh,you know,i've seen nate
do that knee bounce thing

473
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,660
with the soccer ball,and
it's-it's amazing.

474
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,520
well,my mom's actually
out at our hamptons house,

475
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,810
but i still have school,so
i gotta-i gotta stick around.

476
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,730
you staying by yourself?
isn't that kind of lonely?

477
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,780
well,yeah,but,i mean... i grew up there.

478
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,660
you know,it's where
all the memories are.

479
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,760
do you know what this is about?
to show me lily's poliform kitchen?

480
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,310
i love what it does with the doors.

481
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,740
did you really think
i wasn't gonna find out

482
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:54,050
my company was buying a bar in
brooklyn? it wasn't a secret.

483
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,660
i just wanted to make sure
i had everything in place.

484
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,030
did you read the proposal?
why would i do that?

485
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,830
because... the tax break will be huge.

486
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,220
saving a landmark buys us amazing p.r.,

487
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,540
engenders goodwill in the community,

488
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,040
paving the way for future investment.

489
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,850
plus,it's a great place.

490
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,980
look,father,let me take you
there and show you around.

491
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,890
<i>i'll make you a believer,i
promise. what i believe</i>

492
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,770
is that you've betrayed my
trust and wasted my time.

493
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,990
this is a good move for bass industries.

494
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:24,020
<i>i stand behind it. really? chuck bass
stands behind it. what's that worth?</i>

495
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,600
i gave people my word.
they're counting on me.

496
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,780
well,luckily,letting
people down is your forte.

497
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,980
oh,man.

498
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,730
this has been great.
but,look,i should go.

499
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,980
look,i,uh,i'm tired,so...
what about scattegories?

500
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,980
oh,i can't believe i just used
scattegories as an enticement.

501
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,030
well,next time.

502
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,060
w
- uh,i mean,it's late.

503
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,050
you sure you just don't wanna crash
on the couch? nah. no,it's cool.

504
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,320
look,uh,nate,i...

505
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,880
i,uh,i-i know about how
you're living... at home.

506
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,080
excuse me. what? it was a mistake.

507
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,490
i just thought we were supposed
to meet at your place today.

508
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:04,730
but i saw the notice. wait,so
you-so you broke into my home?

509
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,620
well,no. i mean,there w-

510
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,910
there wasn't really much to break into.

511
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:11,240
it's just,you kno j-jenny and i
wanted to help you. jenny knows,too?

512
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,740
oh,so suddenly i'm the humphrey family's
favorite charity,huh? no,no,it's not like that.

513
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,530
no,look,you tell your dad

514
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,660
i said thank you,and
then i had to leave. nate-

515
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,490
dan,we hang out at yale,we
played soccer once. so what?

516
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:22,720
just stay out of it.

517
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,320
hey.

518
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,100
i overheard the end
of that conversation.

519
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,120
and i'm sorry.

520
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,970
i don't know your dad,

521
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,070
but from...

522
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,660
what i saw today,you deserve better.

523
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,370
you say that...

524
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,120
but you don't really know me.

525
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,240
my father,on the other hand,has
a lifetime of experience.

526
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,900
the man makes some good points.

527
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,520
stay.

528
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,350
please.

529
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:21,490
bart told me i could bring jonathan.

530
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:25,560
and do i really want to come out in a national
magazine? he's worried about his own image.

531
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,360
i don't think so. i think
he's trying to protect me.

532
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,110
why-why are you so
against him? i don't know.

533
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,180
excuse me. serena,eric,would
you guys mind

534
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,310
if our reporter asked
you a few questions?

535
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,940
honestly? sure.

536
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,780
so your mom told me how
close-knit your family is.

537
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,860
is there a particular
memory that stands out?

538
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,950
a birthday or christmas? she said what?

539
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:47,650
just that- um,excuse me. i
just need to-to borrow serena.

540
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,710
you said we were close-knit
family? i'll bring her right back,

541
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,460
and i'll tell you all
about the wonderful time

542
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:56,230
that we had in mustique. it was such
fun. don't you mean you and constantine?

543
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,530
or did you forget,the same way

544
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:01,390
you forget to say good-bye to me and eric
every time you left? serena,don't do this.

545
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:07,240
if you have issues with bart,fine,but don't
sabotage this. what? i-i'm not doing anything.

546
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,420
i thought we were just sharing memories

547
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,220
of a-what a close family we are.

548
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,580
i remember this one
time,um,when i was 11.

549
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,350
eric and i wanted a white christmas.

550
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,910
luckily,mom's husband
was a raging cokehead,

551
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:20,810
so he left blow everywhere. oh,my god.

552
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:23,640
it wasn't everywhere-just
on the smooth,shiny surfaces.

553
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,470
was that,um,german klaus with a "k,"

554
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,840
or was it danish claus with a "c"?

555
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,420
i can't ever remember which
ones she actually married

556
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,410
or which she just decided

557
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,350
were more important than her children.

558
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,170
you know what? i was-i was wrong.

559
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,770
it's not bart at all. it's you.

560
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,820
<i>looks like the bass housewarming party</i>

561
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,650
<i>just got a little colder.</i>

562
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:47,440
<i>serena's walk down memory lane
has her heading out the door.</i>

563
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,800
bet's of

564
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:02,970
but the game's not over.

565
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,830
i'm calling it on account of boredom.

566
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,710
you were right. vanessa's
not worth playing with.

567
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:10,760
maybe she is,maybe she isn't.
why the sudden change of heart?

568
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,800
like i said,the whole thing is dull.

569
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,120
pursuing vanessa is beneath us both.

570
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,990
you think i'm going in for the kill.

571
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:19,730
you're worried you're gonna

572
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,250
have to go through
with what you promised.

573
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,320
i'm not worried... about... that.

574
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,530
well,then what?

575
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,920
then... nothing.

576
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:32,420
just... forget it.

577
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,280
i can't believe serena did
that in front of everyone-

578
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,230
that reporter,all of these people.

579
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:47,060
<i>eric,my darling,you are
always honest with me.</i>

580
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,570
it isn't true,is it?

581
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:52,370
i know serena's timing sucked,

582
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,600
but she did pretty much
raise me all those years.

583
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,720
oh... you just weren't here,you know?

584
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,330
<i>i wasn't that bad.</i>

585
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,890
our ringtone for you
was "since u been gone."

586
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,240
vanya the doorman

587
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,010
used to sign our permission
slips from school.

588
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:09,530
well,there was a lot
going on in my life.

589
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,920
and i did the best i
could,just like i'm doing now.

590
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,660
yeah,but now it's like

591
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,110
you want us to go from
zero to brady in 60 seconds.

592
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,370
we're not there yet.

593
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,580
oh,i know,but i just thought if-

594
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,060
you don't become a family
just by telling people you are.

595
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,120
<i>you become a family
because you want to be one.</i>

596
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,180
i
- mm. i think mine's carbonated.

597
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,510
yours?

598
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,550
you're still upset.

599
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,760
well,like i said,i tried to
help him,and then he bailed.

600
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,160
so,you know,if he doesn't want my help,

601
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,740
then that's-that's fine.

602
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,210
and being a friend means giving
someone something they need

603
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,150
even when they can't
ask for it,which you did.

604
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:01,910
right. i-i did that. so... it
also means not giving up on them

605
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,520
when they say "no,thank you."

606
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,950
<i>i didn't do that,and i'm not doing that.</i>

607
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,600
he wants to be alone. it's his choice.

608
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,120
good luck to him. well,from what you
told me,this thing is pretty intense.

609
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,590
i don't know if he has
anyone else in his life

610
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,250
looking out for him right now.

611
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,610
you really wanna be his
friend,you need to be that person

612
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,120
i know i left my bag with my coat.

613
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,150
could you just check again? no need.

614
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,650
don't tell me you took
my purse by mistake.

615
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:28,710
hardly.

616
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:31,300
but then it wasn't your bag i was after.

617
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,040
don't you know

618
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,430
never to leave anything
that valuable unattended?

619
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:38,400
oh,and i took the liberty of increasing
your storage space. what did you do?

620
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,700
marcus and catherine are free

621
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:45,780
to live their sick little
lives in peace,as am i.

622
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,300
except one more thing.

623
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,010
you may think you've
discovered the hidden chuck,

624
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,220
but you should know

625
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,930
he has no real feelings
for you whatsoever.

626
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,680
it was all a little bet we made

627
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,910
to see just how gullible you could be.

628
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,000
i don't believe you.

629
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,580
it was simple,really.

630
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,810
chuck wanted to get
dan,and i wanted to get you.

631
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:11,050
so are you telling me that
chuck had his dad's company

632
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,650
make an offer on the brooklyn inn

633
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,530
in order to get back at dan?

634
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:17,240
isn't that a little
convoluted,even for the two of you?

635
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,090
real estate was just foreplay.

636
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:23,810
seducing and humiliating you was the
ultimate goal. chuck didn't hit on me once.

637
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,610
maybe what's really going on
here is that you can't stand

638
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:31,490
that he might actually be a good person when
he's not around you. i seriously doubt that.

639
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,430
what are you doing,blair?

640
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,480
tying up some loose ends,

641
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,990
telling vanessa that she
doesn't mean anything to you.

642
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,230
we were just playing chess,

643
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,990
and she was another piece
that you needed to knock over

644
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:45,330
on your way to take the
queen. do you disagree?

645
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,710
guess i-i should've known.

646
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,230
good boy. what the hell
was the point of that?

647
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,960
well,you may not have seduced her,

648
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,480
but she seems pretty humiliated
to me. what are you saying?

649
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,090
i'm saying...

650
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,590
i lost,you won.

651
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,670
i'll be waiting in my room in one hour.

652
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,840
come claim your prize.

653
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,980
<i>poor chuck bass.</i>

654
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:19,450
<i>you made your bet. now
you have to lie in it.</i>

655
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,420
dan,is at you?

656
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,170
ar?? you're the only person here.

657
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:35,260
right,but that's,uh,never
stopped you before.

658
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,940
i deserve that.

659
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,400
i haven't started yet.

660
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,620
fine. sit,pile it on. my
night couldn't get any worse.

661
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:56,090
coming to rub my nose in it?
falling for your line of bull...

662
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,790
talk to vanessa already?

663
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,520
look,i know you have
no reason to trust me.

664
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,500
and you ain't gonna be
able to give me one,eith,

665
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,040
so you might as well go. look,i
don't care what you think about me.

666
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,110
but i'm not giving up.
i'm gonna save this place.

667
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,100
try saving yourself first,kid.

668
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,650
i like to think i know
people,but i was wrong about you.

669
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,100
so what are you doing at nate's anyway?

670
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,070
well,uh,nate and i are friends.

671
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:36,090
at least,i hope we are. what about you?

672
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,170
i just had to get out of
my house,talk to someone.

673
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:45,320
blair was busy. chuck is... chuck.

674
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,870
the only person i
really wanted to talk to,

675
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:52,060
i can't anymore.

676
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,330
so i came here.

677
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,220
pretend i'm nate.

678
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,380
what? pretend i'm-

679
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,560
well,look,he pretended to
be me,so it's only fair.

680
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,460
really?

681
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,370
my mom hosted this big party.

682
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:12,020
it as supposed to be
about our new family.

683
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,080
but it turns out,of
course,it was for publicity.

684
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,660
so i-i blew up at her
in front of everyone.

685
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,980
and this whole time,

686
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,110
i was thinking that
bart was the problem,

687
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,440
but i-i realized it's all her.

688
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,040
you ever think that your
mom acts like she's perfect

689
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,060
because she's...

690
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,470
she's... too ashamed to acknowledge

691
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,530
how far from it she's really been?

692
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,360
<i>i thought you were
pretending to be nate.</i>

693
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,820
kidding.

694
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,700
i'm sorry.

695
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,310
you-do you not think i'm right?

696
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:49,420
no,i'm-i mean,i'm
sorry about everything.

697
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,320
i am,too.

698
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:01,880
they must have had me
chipped while i was sleeping.

699
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,820
hi,mr. bass.

700
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,430
hello,daniel. eric
said you might be here.

701
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,110
i'd like to take you home,serena.

702
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,840
i should probably go,

703
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:15,980
test out some of...
those theories of yours,

704
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,300
see if they hold up.

705
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,090
i'm really glad you're nate's friend.

706
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,760
he really needs someone
like you right now.

707
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,470
hey. where is everyone?

708
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,270
well...

709
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,040
the party wasn't the
same after you left.

710
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,450
actually,i think it
might've even stopped

711
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:57,970
while you were still here.

712
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,020
i owe you an apology.

713
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,420
<i>no,i'm the one who said
things they shouldn't have.</i>

714
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:11,300
no,not about that,about the
17 years that i wasn't here.

715
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,010
and i did put the men in
my life before you guys.

716
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,940
well,it wasn't all bad.

717
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,810
there was a brief
period between klauses.

718
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,600
don't forget
that,uh,weekend with sarkozy

719
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,630
when he made us go to euro disney. oh!

720
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,280
i'm sorry i embarrassed you

721
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,750
in front of a national magazine.

722
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,000
and i'm sorry i acted the way i did.

723
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,020
apology accepted.

724
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,360
well,our family is our family.

725
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,220
that's just who we are.

726
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,920
and i shouldn't care who
knows about it,and i don't.

727
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,960
<i>just like the seasons,people
have the ability to change.</i>

728
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,990
<i>it doesn't happen very often,</i>

729
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,470
<i>but when it does,</i>

730
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:50,640
<i>it's almost always right.</i>

731
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:54,470
you killed the story,didn't
you? i already put out the hit.

732
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,490
<i>sometimes it takes what's broken</i>

733
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,140
<i>becoming whole again.</i>

734
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,370
uh... "r."

735
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,380
<i>what happened? sometimes it takes</i>

736
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,120
<i>opening up to new people
and letting them in.</i>

737
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,340
hope you don't mind,but
we've,uh,we've got a lodger.

738
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,640
so i'll make up the sofa?
i'll get the ice cream.

739
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,820
and i'll get the guitar

740
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:20,550
and the "songs of the '80s"
fakebook. i'm thinking wham!

741
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:24,450
uh,almost forgot
- make yourself at home.

742
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:37,200
<i>but most times,it takes just one person</i>

743
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,350
<i>who is truly afraid
to show what they feel</i>

744
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:43,290
<i>getting an opportunity
they never thought possible.</i>

745
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,990
what took you so long?

746
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,550
if you thought that was long,

747
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,790
you have no idea what you're in for.

748
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:22,170
* in her eastern overcoat

749
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,050
* used to wear...

750
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,350
say it.

751
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,290
say what? i'll say anything.

752
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:36,930
say those three words
you wanted me to say.

753
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:39,670
* before we went to sleep

754
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,000
"are you kidding?"

755
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,030
not quite.

756
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,410
eight letters. three syllables.

757
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,860
say them,and i'm your

758
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:54,480
but i'm already yours,

759
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,960
you wanted it from me.
i'm prepared to settle.

760
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,120
**

761
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,410
maybe i'm not.

762
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,560
* couldn't walk,she wouldn't cry *

763
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,780
chuck bass,

764
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,960
i...

765
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,240
will never say those words to you.

766
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,050
then you will never have me.

767
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:17,260
* dreams are half-asleep

768
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,900
<i>is this because of vanessa?
it was a game,chuck.</i>

769
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,520
that it.

770
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,170
maybe i want to raise the stakes.

771
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:29,030
<i>are you ready to play that game?</i>

772
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,530
i chased you for long enough.

773
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,870
now it's time you chased me.

774
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,320
* sea out,now

775
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:39,170
<i>and some things never change.</i>

776
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,390
<i>let a new game begin.</i>
