1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Gossip girl here, you one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan elites. 

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,450
You must really want this.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,560
- Yeah. Yeah, I really, really do.  - Where's that story of yours?

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,300
Noah Shapiro at the "Paris review"

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,560
is looking forward to it. I... I know. I tried to write.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,700
- You'll get no letter of recommendation from me.  - I need a friend.

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,900
I'm sorry, Lily. You made your choice to be Mrs. Bass.

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,930
- You need to go do that.  - You're a born queen. This is your year to rule.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,160
- Being queen is Blair's whole thing.  - Well, well. Look who's back on top.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,300
I wonder how that happened.

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,930
And who am I?

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,400
That's a secret I'll never tell.

13
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,400
You know you love me.

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,360
X.o.x.o., gossip girl.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,130
When the white tents blossom in Bryant Park,

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,900
It can only mean one thing... fashIon week,

17
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,530
The tIme of year when any park ave princess

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,160
Would trade her last prada pochette

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,900
For front row seats to the best shows.

20
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,560
# Gone, gone from new york city #

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,330
# Where you gonna go with a heart that gone? #

22
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,130
And we hear the seatIng chart to eleanor waldorf's show

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,660
Is beIng made by our very own B.

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,160
This art director

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,400
Just ran off with the husband of this photo editor.

26
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,930
So I sat all of "vanity fair" between them.

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,200
I figured we'd want to avoid

28
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,060
- A catfight in front of the catwalk.  - I told Laurel my daughter could make a better seating chart

29
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,060
than that drug-addled publicist.

30
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,060
It's a blessing she was hauled off to rehab

31
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,230
- for stealing her son's ritalin.  - I'm more than happy to step in.

32
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,660
And you and Serena will be with me backstage, of course?

33
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,660
Of course. It's our tradition.

34
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,660
Now I hope you don't mind,

35
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,660
But I sat the girls from school in the second row.

36
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,660
Well, since they are your friends, why not?

37
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,430
- Besides, they'll worship you for it.  - I know.

38
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,960
Oh, school.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,430
Another day of reading, writing and aristocrats.

40
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,760
- You back to invisible boy?  - Invisible suits me. I can go to school unshowered.

41
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,030
I can forget to dress. Nobody cares.

42
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,030
And now I have all the time in the world

43
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,000
To focus on my yale application, so... Don't you mean dartmouth?

44
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,500
Yeah, well, it seems that

45
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,730
Dartmouth's whole English department was poached by yale.

46
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,030
- Wow. When's that application due?  - Monday. Noah Shapiro's helping me choose

47
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,030
Which stories to submit. Wait. What happened to that Jeremiah Harris guy?

48
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,030
Oh, yeah. He, uh, well, after he fired me,

49
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,130
I went ahead and sent my story to Shapiro anyway,

50
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,000
- And he... he... he loved it.  - That's great! Why haven't you told me any of this?

51
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,000
Well, I've barely seen you.

52
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,060
You're always off at your internship.

53
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,300
Hey. You have french first period.

54
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,800
- Aren't you gonna be late?  - Uh. Uh, we have a sub, and he alays starts late, so...

55
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,160
Okay. Well, I'm really late for Italian, so ciao, sorella mia.

56
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,700
Hi. Laurel? Yeah, it's me. Sorry. I got stuck in traffic.

57
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,400
I'll see you at Eleanor's in five, okay?

58
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,430
Kiki smith greeting you in the foyer.

59
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,700
Elm and drag pulling you into the main room.

60
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,430
I love that.

61
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,160
And making a statement on the stairwell...

62
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,760
Richard phillips.

63
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,130
Hi, mom. I borrowed your necklace.

64
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,230
- Oh, it's stunning! Serena, do you think...  -  It's a necklace, mom.

65
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,430
Oh, but I'm talking about the art collection.

66
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,330
Isn't it just breathtaking?

67
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,330
Any museum would be thrilled.

68
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,330
Let's hope bart is when he gets back from luxembourg this week.

69
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,830
It's really great, mom.

70
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,830
Your art consultant has exquisite taste.

71
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,030
- You got in late last night.  - Oh, yeah.

72
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,030
I had the m.o.m.a. Event with, uh, Poppy. Mm.

73
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,560
We were perfect ladies, though. We sipped on sodas all night.

74
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,530
- Oh, Poppy Lifton, the socialite?  - Yes, they met at a charity affair the other week,

75
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,960
And they've been attached at the hip ever since.

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,360
Now for over here...

77
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,360
Yes, the Ryan Mcginley.

78
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,960
Yes. Uh, something else.

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,860
There's a mapplethorpe that's coming up for auction. Uh...

80
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,430
Wait. Mapplethorpe...

81
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,130
Isn't that the one who took all the pictures of the naked guys?

82
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,330
Yeah. Um, not just guys.

83
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,900
Wait.

84
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,960
Mom, did you... Well...

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,100
- You modeled for Mapplethorpe?  - Well, I kept it a secret,

86
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:56,730
- But I think you and Eric are old enough now...  - No, but it's not one of those artsy shots

87
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,830
- where you can't tell if it's a belly button or a...  - Well, it's very tasteful, I assure you.

88
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,700
You just became the coolest mom on the upper east side.

89
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,060
Mm. Thank you.

90
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,900
Ah, the besieged queen.

91
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,900
- What do you want, Chuck?  - To help. Your throne's in danger,

92
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,930
And you can't wage war on Serena without an ally.

93
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,760
- You need me.  - There is no war.

94
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,260
Now that Marcus has been booted back to Brighton,

95
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,260
I'm free to focus on my old life.

96
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,960
Serena's just been keeping my seat warm.

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,900
And how do you plan on making the girls fall at your feet?

98
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,300
- You going to trip them?  - A true monarch bestows favors. It's fashion week,

99
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,600
And I'm the only Constance girl with clout.

100
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,860
Ladies...

101
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,060
I trust tomorrow night you won't embarrass me.

102
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,230
Oh, my god. Second row seats to your mother's show?

103
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,260
Oh, my god. Those are total movie star seats.  Oh.

104
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,100
Serena is in "women's wear daily"...

105
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,100
- With Poppy Lifton.  - Serena could, like, die now

106
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,500
- Knowing that she's lived a fulfilled life.  - Hey, guys.

107
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,430
- You look gorgeous in the photo.  - Oh, my gosh. Is poppy nice?  - She looks so nice.

108
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,130
What? Oh, gosh. I haven't even seen that.

109
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,730
Blair, where are you going?

110
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,060
I'll just leave you to your fans.

111
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,900
So when can I meet her?

112
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,960
Watching you fail spectacularly gives me so much joy.

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,700
And you know what you give to everyone, Chuck? Misery.

114
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,030
There's a reason you're always out here alone.

115
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,030
Nate just happens to be away at his grandparents'.

116
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,460
Nate's only friends with you out of habit.

117
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,000
The only person with fewer friends than you

118
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,000
is Dan Humphrey, and at least his lame '90s dad likes him.

119
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,760
And that's because he's something you'll never be...

120
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
A human being.

121
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,860
Let me be blunt, humphrey. These stories are no good.

122
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,330
What?

123
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,330
Uh, you... you... you said my last one was...

124
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,000
It wasn't bad.

126
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,930
Okay.

127
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,300
You sent me five stories,

128
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,300
All about a sheltered young man with girl trouble

129
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,860
Who lives with his daddy in brooklyn.

130
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,500
You think that's gonna knock the yale english department

131
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,660
Off their tenured asses?

132
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,830
I-I just... I thought a writer

133
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,830
Was supposed to write what you know.

134
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,630
This is what I know.

135
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,630
Then learn something new. Get out of your comfort zone.

136
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,630
A cardinal rule of writing...

137
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,560
If your work's too safe, do something dangerous.

138
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,830
I-I wouldn't know where to begin.

139
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,230
Then find someone who does know.

140
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,560
When I was young,

141
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,430
Bukowski put a shot glass on my head

142
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,930
And blew it off with a pistol.

143
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,030
Find your Bukowski.

144
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,400
Then get back to me.

145
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,000
When I said "50s hemline"

146
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,000
I meant like flirty Marilyn,

147
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,760
- Not long, dowdy poodle skirt.  - I'm so sorry, Eleanor.

148
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,830
Fix this thing before i faint.

149
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,660
Eleanor, this seating chart is weak.

150
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,260
Where are all our "it" girls?

151
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,760
They're there. Look.

152
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,730
Well, Kirsten Dunst? So 2007.

153
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,960
Her rehab stint barely made the radar.

154
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,230
Blair says we can't get "a"-list girls

155
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,230
Because our show is the same time as Marc Jacobs.

156
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,130
But those girls bring press.

157
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,100
Without them...

158
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,200
Eleanor, Serena has some new friends.

159
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,600
- I bet she could help.  - New friends?

160
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,430
It's like the plague,

161
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,630
Only instead of vermin on my doorstep,

162
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,900
I get the "human being." beat it, humphrey.

163
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,100
My sister doesn't dig stalkers. Actually, as strange as it sounds, I'm here to see you.

164
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,100
I-i know we don't like each other.

165
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,500
You think I'm a boring, sheltered nobody.

166
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,560
- I don't think of you.  - Oh, right. Of course you don't,

167
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,000
But, uh, but i've been thinking of me,

168
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,130
And--and i've come to the conclusion

169
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,660
That i need to get out of my comfort zone.

170
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,660
- I-I need to experience new things.  - Are you gay?

171
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,530
Now that would be out of my comfort zone, but no.

172
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,560
Uh, i just need to get out of brooklyn for one night.

173
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,400
I'd like to experience the world of Chuck Bass.

174
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,260
You're lucky I'm bored.

175
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,860
Is that a yes?

176
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,560
Get in before i change my mind.

177
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,530
Don't ever go to high school, Dorota.

178
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,230
The girls are spoiled, stupid and ungrateful.

179
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,230
One snapshot with a socialite

180
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,460
And it's all, "Serena! Serena! Serena!"

181
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,700
Have some tea. Will calm your nerves.  - Don't they know that without me,

182
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,200
They'd never see the inside of a fashion tent?!

183
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:35,300
They'd be stuck behind the barricades with P.E.T.A!

184
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,200
In fact, i will leave them outside with P.E.T.A.

185
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,500
Maybe that'll teach them some manners.

186
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,130
Something's different.

187
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,130
Who put Serena and that Poppy person in the front row?

188
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,860
And all these socialites?

189
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,360
Someone changed this chart,

190
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,060
The chart my mother asked me to do!

191
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,560
Who changed it?!

192
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,860
Eleanor said miss... Jenny change.

193
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,630
Jenny Humphrey?

194
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,030
I guess she didn't learn her lesson last year.

195
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,230
Looks like someone needs a refresher course.

196
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,500
What would fashion week be without a fashion victim?

197
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:10,130
Looks like little J. Just started her own trend--

198
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,160
Wearing a bull's-eye on her back.

199
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,500
- Mom.  - Good. You saw the changes we made to the chart.

200
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,500
Aren't they marvelous? That's not quite the word i was going to use.

201
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,930
Jenny had the inspired idea putting Serena

202
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,930
And Poppy lifton and their friends in the front row.

203
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,830
But i already told you Poppy and her crowd

204
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,830
Never miss Marc Jacobs' show.

205
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,400
And Serena would never watch the show

206
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,400
From anywhere but backstage with me.

207
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,000
- It's our ritual. None of them will agree to this.  - I spoke to Lily. They already have.

208
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,660
Even Serena?

209
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,100
Absolutely. Marc is going to eat his grunge corduroys.

210
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,800
- All this thanks to little Jenny Humphrey.  - Ah, the girl is quite a talent.

211
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,300
She shouldered most of the workload

212
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,530
At the atelier this week. How did she manage that after school?

213
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,160
- Jenny doesn't go to school. She's got a-a...  - Independent study?

214
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,300
Independent study thing this semester.

215
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,800
A 10th grader with an independent study?

216
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,100
Mm-hmm.

217
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:11,660
I just realized i forgot a book at school.

218
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,460
Have fun, honey.

219
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,430
- You never learn, do you?  - Excuse me?

220
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,860
Great job ruining my seating chart.

221
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,560
Your seating chart?  - Blair, i didn't know.

222
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,100
Well, now you do.

223
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,160
Here you go.

224
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,900
Wow. Wow, that's cool.

225
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,700
You just signal the bartender,

226
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,700
And she sends over a line of shots?

227
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,030
Do you--do you have another signal if you want a martini?

228
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,900
Is--is there, like, a insider hand-signal system

229
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,400
- For the drunken elite?  - Shut up, Humphrey.

231
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,930
I, uh, I'm good with just one.

232
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,360
You're either in for the full ride or you're out.

233
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,600
What's it going to be?

235
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,030
All right. Pass me the shots.

236
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,760
The liquor's just a chaser.

237
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,230
- What is that?  - Does it matter?

238
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,500
Go down the rabbit hole

239
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,830
Or go out the door.

240
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,230
- It is so nice to finally get to meet you, Mrs. Bass.  - You, too, Poppy.

241
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,830
- Please call me Lily.  - Hey, mom, Poppy told me that you called her assistant

242
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,640
To make arrangements for the two of us To go to Eleanor's show together.

243
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,420
Serena doesn't seem to think it's such a good idea.

244
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,160
Blair would be furious. Things are already tense between us.

245
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,160
And we always watch the show backstage together.

246
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,160
- You know that, mom.  - I know you did that when you were 12,

247
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,600
But it is an honor to sit in the front row,

248
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,530
- And Eleanor specifically requested you.  - It is the only way to see a show, Serena.

249
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,430
Yeah, but you don't know Blair.

250
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,600
- She would never forgive me, ever.  - Okay, we'll do Eleanor's show,

251
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,160
and then when we go to the Marc Jacobs after party,

252
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,160
- your friend Blair can come along. I have extra passes!  - See, that is a wonderful idea.

253
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,300
Oh. Uh, she might be okay with that. 

254
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,560
- I'll ask her.  - Oh, sorry. Forgive me, girls. I have to take this call.

255
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,030
It's my art dealer. Did you find the photo?

256
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,030
It can't have already sold.

257
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,900
The auction's not until next week.

258
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,230
Okay, well, find out who bought it

259
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,760
and make them a better offer.

260
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,560
Blair, what could we have done to deserve a visit from you?

261
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,560
I heard Jenny wasn't feeling well,

262
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,230
so I brought her some chicken soup.

263
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,100
That's thoughtful of you.

264
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,700
Uh, but I think you have the wrong information.

265
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,330
You mean Jenny's not sick?

266
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,430
That's strange.

267
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,430
When I ran into Headmistress Queller,

268
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,430
she told me Jenny Humphrey hadn't been to school

269
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,200
in ten days due to a bad case of mono.

270
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,200
Apparently, her mother called to make sure the school knew.

271
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,200
You know that Jenny's working with your mom tonight.

272
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,200
I also know that you don't have

273
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,430
my daughter's best interests at heart.

274
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,430
Whatever my motives may be, Mr. Humphrey, facts are facts,

275
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,430
and the fact is, Jenny hasn't been to school in two weeks.

276
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,930
I happen to have

277
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,560
Headmistress Queller's home number in my phone.

278
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,100
Why don't you ask her yourself? 

279
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,100
You know, that was so intense, how you talked to those hookers.

280
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,860
who knew there was a sex club behind the white castle?

281
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,630
Oh, and beer before liquor.

282
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,530
- How do you know so many twins?  - The twins find me.

283
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,760
Ah. Well, look, you know, I... I... I got to admit,

284
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,760
this was, uh, this was awesome.

285
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,730
We gotta do this again.

286
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,730
God. My feet are hot. Are your feet hot?

287
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,260
- Why don't you take off your shoes?  - Mm.

288
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,760
That feels amazing.

289
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,300
Arthur, pull over.

290
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,460
This isn't Brooklyn. Aren't you taking me home?

291
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,730
Get out.

292
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,930
Wait. No. I... I... I don't...

293
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,600
Tonight was nothing.

294
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,600
You're just a drunken idiot...

295
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,960
My amusement for the night.

296
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,060
Can I at least have my shoes?

297
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,500
Spotted... Dan Humphrey,

298
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,530
shoeless and clueless...

299
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,030
Dad, what are you doing here?

300
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,200
I suggest you get up and come with me without another word.

301
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,630
I can't. Eleanor and Laurel are gonna be back any minute.

302
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,800
I don't care. As of this minute, your fashion duties are over.

303
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,800
Dad, I promised Eleanor I'd fix this hem.

304
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:15,100
- She's counting on me, okay?  - And I counted on you to show up to school,

305
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,100
the school to which I pay tens of thousands of dollars

306
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,460
every year, might I add.

307
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,860
So I think you've had plenty of practice letting people down.

308
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,360
- Dad, please. I can explain, okay?  - Why would I believe anything you say?

309
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,100
Let's go.

310
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,500
Okay.

311
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,960
They say in fashion, you can become a success overnight.

312
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,960
But one minute you're in,

313
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,560
and the next you're out.

314
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,500
It's not as bad as it looks.

315
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,360
A girl in my class was e-mailing me my assignments,

316
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,360
and I was keeping up with all of my reading.

317
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,660
I just needed to get through fashion week,

318
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,660
and it would have been fine.

319
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,930
Being a liar and a truant is not what I would call "fine."

320
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,360
Look, I'm sorry that I cut school and that I lied.

321
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,100
I just... I wanted to help Eleanor so badly,

322
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,700
and I did.

323
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,130
Dad, I'm really good at this.

324
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,130
Well, I hope you're as good at groveling.

325
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,530
I just spent 30 minutes on the phone this morning

326
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,460
with Headmistress Queller, convincing her

327
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,460
That you shouldn't be expelled.

328
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,400
I did my part. Now you're gonna do yours.

329
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,530
You have an appointment at her office this afternoon

330
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,860
to prove you're an honorable person

331
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,160
- worthy of a second chance. Go get dressed.  - Dad, it's a Saturday.

332
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,160
So be glad she's willing to come in on her day off.

333
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,830
- What do you want?  - I tried to reach you all night.

334
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,060
- Why haven't you returned any of my calls?  - What is there to say?

335
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,500
You've only taken over the girls at school

336
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,530
and abandoned our oldest tradition

337
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,530
to go to my mother's show with a complete stranger.

338
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,930
- First of all, I didn't take over the girls at school.  - Are you really gonna pretend

339
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,830
- like you don't notice what's been going on?  - What? These girls are like hummingbirds.

340
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,830
They move from flower to flower.

341
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,830
They'll be on to someone else next week and then back to you.

342
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,930
- It's not a big deal.  - And I suppose it's not a big deal

343
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,500
- that you're sitting front row at my mother's show either.  - She asked me to do it as a favor.

344
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,860
Oh, and how could you possibly disappoint my mother?!

345
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,830
- Though you have no qualms about screwing over your best friend.  - Fine. I won't go.

346
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,830
- Good!  - And then Poppy won't go, and her friends won't go,

347
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,430
and you can explain to your mother

348
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,430
- why she has an empty first row. Would that make you happy?  - At least I won't have to watch the next episode

349
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,430
- of the Serena show.  - You know, I was coming here to invite you to hang out with us.

350
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,960
Oh, how generous, Serena. I should feel so blessed

351
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,230
that you would include me in your little group.

352
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,230
You know what, Blair? I am gonna go to that show,

353
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,860
and I'm gonna sit front row,

354
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,430
and I'm gonna enjoy every minute of it.

355
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,500
- Boo!  - But...

356
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,700
Brooklyn kid sees a live hooker for the first time,

357
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,560
loses his shoes.

358
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,260
There's so much saccharine in this. This gave me cancer

359
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,600
All right, but I did what you told me.

360
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,060
I... I went out with a guy I can't stand.

361
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,060
Uh, yes. This Charlie Trout character...

362
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,260
Now that guy's interesting, complex,

363
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,900
a young mephistopheles.

364
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,900
- write from his point of view. Then you'd have a story.  - No, no.

365
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:36,600
no, there's no way that I'm writing from his point of view.

366
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,130
- I hate that guy.  - You're judging the character, Humphrey.

367
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,130
You think Capote got national acclaim

368
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,930
for "in cold blood" by judging the murderers?

369
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,430
I'm... I'm guessing no.

370
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,400
Dig beneath the surface.

371
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,500
Get into Charlie Trout's head.

372
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,160
Find the character's humanity.

373
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,700
That might be difficult.

374
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,960
We all have a secret.

375
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,300
A writer's best tool is the ability

376
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:03,430
to draw out a subject's secret and use it.

377
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,430
Okay, so I go back out there,

378
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,000
I-I make him trust me and find out his secret?

379
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,030
Be ruthless and bring me back a story with teeth.

380
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,400
Did you find it?

381
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,530
- I did.  - Did you offer the seller whatever they want for it?

382
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,530
I didn't have to. You already know the man who bought it.

383
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,000
Excuse me?

384
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,000
Your husband. Bart bought it anonymously.

385
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:52,130
I had to call in a favor with a friend at Sotheby's

386
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,900
- to get his name.  - But I never mentioned it to him.

387
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,930
- No one knows about that Mapplethorpe.  - I highly doubt it was a coincidence.

388
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,930
He's Bart Bass. I'm sure he found out about it

389
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,700
- and bought it for you as a gift.  - I hate to say that I'm surprised that he knows me so well,

390
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,260
But that is the kind of husband I've always wanted.

391
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,230
# My... my... my poker face #

392
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,200
# My... my... my poker face #

393
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,030
# My... my... my poker face, my... my... my poker face # 

394
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,730
Lena, so glad you could make it. I love your hat.

395
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,430
This way, Poppy. Can we get a picture? Serena! Poppy!

396
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,830
Excuse me.

397
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,530
Russian roulette is not the same without a gun 

398
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,000
# And, baby, when it's love #

399
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,360
# If it's not rough, it isn't fun #

400
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,930
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #

401
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,630
Oh. Is there a problem, Serena?

402
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,230
Yeah, there is.

403
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,530
Excuse me. I think there's been a mistake.

404
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,930
My name is Serena Van Der Woodsen,

405
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,930
- And someone else's name is on my seat.  - Let me check.

406
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,430
There's no mistake.

407
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,930
- Miss Van Der Woodsen is sitting in the back row.  - No, she's not.

408
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,730
- She's in the front row with Poppy Lifton.  - What are you doing here?

409
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,760
- My job, no thanks to you.  - Don't you have socks to darn?

410
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,430
Blair, this is not about you or me.

411
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,900
Go find Serena's name card and put it on the correct seat.

412
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,560
Don't touch Serena's name card. It remains where it is.

413
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,360
Jenny, why aren't you backstage?

414
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,000
Oh. What's going on?

415
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,460
Uh, it seems like someone's moved Serena's seat.

416
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,300
Yeah, someone.

417
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,800
 

418
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,960
What is the matter with you? I am so sorry, Serena.

419
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,260
Would you take care of this right away, please?

420
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,930
Could you just spare me the dramatics for one day?

421
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,460
Go backstage. Try not to get underfoot.

422
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,830
Jenny, I am so glad that you are here.

423
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,660
- Yeah?  - Good to hear your voice, too, dad.

424
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,660
- What is it, Chuck?  - I remembered you were flying in tonight.

425
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,660
- I wondered if we could have a drink.  - Why? What kind of trouble are you in?

426
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,660
Is it unimaginable for a son

427
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,660
to just want to sit and talk with his father?

428
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,830
Chuck, I'm tired, I'm jet-lagged, and... 

429
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,160
Okay. Well, maybe later.

430
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Good talking to you, too. 

431
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,460
So was that really the best you had last night?

432
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,200
Don't tell me that was the great Chuck Bass.

433
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,560
Stick around.

434
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,400
Hey. Um, would you mind putting this in the back for me?

435
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:49,400
- It's my dress for the after party.  - No problem.

436
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:52,400
- Thanks.  - Hi. Somehow my job got mixed up with Jenny's,

437
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,400
And I want to make sure there's no more confusionl

438
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,400
- What does the list say jenny's in charge of?  - Mang sure the models get from here to the runway.

439
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,900
Great. Thanks a lot.

440
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:04,000
Spotted... Blair Waldorf looking to do a good deed?

441
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,800
There's a first time for everything.

442
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,530
So what's it really like to be Chuck Bass?

443
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,200
Were you... were you a happy kid?

444
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,360
When'd you start drinking in bars alone?

445
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,030
When I realized hot, desperate women drink in bars alone.

446
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,600
What's your father like?

447
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,200


448
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,900
Me.

449
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,900
Only older...

450
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,460
And meaner.

451
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,500
Look, 20 questions is getting a bit boring.

452
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,300
If you'll excuse me,

453
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:45,330
I'm going to pursue a more fulfilling pastime.

454
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,000
Hey.

455
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,230
Hey.

456
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,460
I pay cash up front now. Let's go.

457
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,030
Excuse me?

458
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,600
Oh, my mistake.

459
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,230
Hey. What's up?

460
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,330
That guy just said I'm a hooker.

461
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,230
Did you just call my girlfriend a prostitute?

462
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,560
It was an honest mistake.

463
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,900
- There's nothing honest about it.  - Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

464
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:21,000
- Come on. Calm down. He said he was sorry. Did he?  - Well, uh, maybe I should teach him some manners then.

465
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,600
It's not my fault

466
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,100
Your girlfriend dresses like a high-class call girl.

467
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,600
That's it. You're dead. Ooh! 

468
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,460
Jenny!

469
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:45,030
Message one.

470
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,960
Mr. Humphrey, this is Headmistress Queller.

471
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,960
I spoke with Jennifer this afternoon,

472
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,460
And the situation has gotten out of control.

473
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,900
Please call me immediately.

474
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:58,760
End of new messages. 

475
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,760
Michael! Michael!

476
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,430
- Oh, you look gorgeous, Tinsley.  - Thank you. Cristina! Over here!

477
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,600
Oh.

478
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,930
Full house.

479
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,160
Mm-hmm. Jenny, get the models ready to go.

480
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,330
- Done.  - Good.

481
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,130
The models that are about to walk the runway

482
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,130
- wearing your mother's clothes?  - Oh, those models.

483
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,630
Somehow they got the idea that they'd been overbooked,

484
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,800
- So they went home.  - What? They went home?

485
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,160
They're not the brightest bulbs, are they?

486
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,400
Jenny, we start in ten. Are the models ready?

487
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,360
No. The models are gone.

488
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,500
What?

489
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:51,330
What do you mean, the models are gone?

490
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,300
How can they be gone?

491
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,000
Wh... what did you do with them? Are you trying to kill me?

492
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,730
Laurel, it's gonna be okay.

493
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,100
- What?  - I have an idea.

494
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,100
Jail, brawling in public.

495
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,100
You know, I hear Yale's looking

496
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,100
to recruit more bar fighters this year.

497
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,100
Bar fighters and, um, pacific islanders.

498
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,100
They're looking to round out the freshman class.

499
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:17,560
For what it's worth, Humphrey, you had my back.

500
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,630
- Never thought I'd say this, but thanks.  - Oh, that.. that changes everything.

501
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,630
College versus Chuck Bass' gratitude...

502
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,200
I think that's a-an even trade.

503
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:29,230
Oh. Oh, no. My dad... my dad's gonna kill me.

504
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,860
Count yourself lucky.

505
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,860
Lucky? H-how is it lucky

506
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,000
that my own father is gonna murder me?

507
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:39,300
- My father doesn't care enough to get angry.  - Yeah, I'm sure.

508
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,560
Please. He expects this.

509
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,560
Oh, he'll be annoyed that he has to call his lawyer.

510
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,200
After that...

511
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,860
Has he always been like that?

512
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,300
Since the day I was born.

513
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,830
No, that's crazy.

514
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,830
Even Bart Bass doesn't hate babies.

515
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,500
It's, uh, it's in our D.N.A

516
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,230
- I think Disney did a study.  - He hated me.

517
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,330
That doesn't make sense.

518
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,800
It does if his beloved wife...

519
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,860
died giving birth to me.

520
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,200
That's not your fault.

521
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,760
Tell him that.

522
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,000
Sometimes I swear he thinks I killed her.

523
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,660
Who knows? Maybe I did.

524
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,130
Chuck Bass, your lawyer called.

525
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,730
You've been released.

526
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,860
I'll, uh...

527
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,600
See if my lawyer can have you released into his custody.

528
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,600
If they haven't reached your father yet,

529
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,930
Maybe they won't have to.

530
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,360
Thanks.

531
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,230
Lily, I'm home.

532
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,000
Aha.

533
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,560
I have missed you.

534
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,030
Good, because I am going to steal your passport

535
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,800
and lock you in our room.

536
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,800
Mmm.

537
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,600
Mmm.

538
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,230
That sounds like the perfect plan. 

539
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,760
But not before I give you something.

540
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,000
Oh!

541
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,130
I mean, if it's not your taste, we can exchange it.

542
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,630
Oh, no, no, no. The necklace is exquisite.

543
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,600
It's... It's just...

544
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,630
You didn't happen to buy a piece of art recently?

545
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,830
Perhaps a Mapplethorpe?

546
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,130
Yes, I did.

547
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,830
You did. Oh! You did. You got it for me.

548
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:58,230
Oh! How did you know and when can I see it?

549
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,760
Well, you can't.

550
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,460
No one can.

551
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,730
I don't understand.

552
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,860
Lily, I'm a powerful man,

553
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,460
and that makes me and those around me a target,

554
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,500
and it is my job to protect this family

555
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:15,160
- from anything that can be used against us.  - Used against us?

556
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,400
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

557
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:22,160
H-how did you even know about it?

558
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,300
Did you hire someone to look into my past?

559
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,300
Do you have a Lily Bass dossier?

560
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,530
I want to see it.

561
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,900
Lily...

562
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:37,630
I want to see it.

563
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,400
Everything.

564
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,330
How on earth does one lose models?

565
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,700
N-n-never mind. This is going to be sensational.

566
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,160
"models lost, socialites save the day."

567
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,660
Oh! Your show will get so much press,

568
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,760
It'll drive Marc Jacobs to drink.

569
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,660
God forbid.

570
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,700
Every time he goes to rehab, his sales soar.

571
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,660
What do you think?

572
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,900
- Well, the dress fits.  - Mm-hmm.

573
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:08,860
How handy is it that society girls are wafer-thin?

574
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,230
- I hope you know what you're doing.  - Yeah. Me, too.

575
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,430
- Hey. Why aren't you dressed?  - I don't think I'm gonna do this.

576
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,930
Blair would be crushed.

577
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,600
If anybody's gonna walk the runway in Eleanor's designs,

578
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,930
It's her.

579
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,930
Serena, I've only known you for a few weeks,

580
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,360
but it's pretty clear you've spent your whole life

581
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,760
worrying about Blair and what she thinks and how she feels.

582
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,000
- You don't understand.  - I was best friends for years

583
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,260
with this girl that was just like Blair,

584
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,330
and it was subtle,

585
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,330
but I was always having to make myself less sparkly

586
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,930
so that she wouldn't feel insecure.

587
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,130
Till one day I finally realized that is crazy...

588
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
'Cause a true friend would want you

589
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,460
to be your most beautiful, vibrant self.

590
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,600
No, I just... I really don't want to hurt her.

591
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,860
I know. I know.

592
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,530
But is that a good reason to hide your light?

593
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:33,100
You're gorgeous, sweet, amazing.

594
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:37,300
If Blair's a true friend, she'll support you.

595
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,030
You're right.

596
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,030
- Yeah?  - Okay. Come on.

597
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,700
Eleanor, where's my dress?

598
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,360
- Here. Here.  - Blair.

599
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,730
- This will be beautiful on you. It's for the finale.  - Are you sure?

600
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,900
- Yes, yes. It's fine. Just hurry.  - Okay. 

601
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,660
Where's Serena?

602
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,230
She's onstage.

603
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,230
But I have her dress.

604
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,500
Oh. You mean Serena's on the runway

605
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,000
of Eleanor Waldorf's show

606
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,030
in a design not made by Eleanor Waldorf?

607
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,130
Oh, dear.

608
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,500
That's not my dress.

609
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:56,730
Yeah. I-it's my dress.

610
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,230
Why did you do this?

611
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,130
I waved the white flag at school. Why don't...

612
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,960
- why don't you just claim your throne and leave me alone?  - Because I can't.

613
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,560
This is about Serena. I didn't realize.

614
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,230
And why would you?

615
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,500
Y-you might be privileged, Blair,

616
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:30,730
But you work for every single thing you've achieved,

617
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,400
Like me.

618
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,500
Serena just glides through.

619
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,830
Tell me about it.

620
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:41,200
I wanted to be your friend last year for a reason.

621
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,700
I wanted you to like me.

622
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,400
Here you go.

623
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,400
Hey, you gave me the wrong bag.

624
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:11,130
You have letters that I wrote to my college boyfriend?

625
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,130
You mean the professor you slept with while at school.

626
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,060
- Bart, where did you get these?  - It doesn't matter, Lily.

627
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:20,460
I love you, and my concern is for our family.

628
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,660
Bart, I'm not ashamed of who I am.

629
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,900
I may have concealed things in the past, but not anymore.

630
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:29,630
I want my children to know their mother.

631
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,760
Is this something you want your kids to know?

632
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,060
Who gave this to you?

633
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:56,360


634
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,300
You were writing about me?

635
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:05,130
Where'd you get that?

636
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,000
You watch your back.

637
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,330
No one uses chuck bass.

638
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,830
I hope you enjoy your stay here.

639
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,560
I hope they make a Humphrey sandwich.

640
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:23,200
The story I told you about my mother?

641
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,100
I was lying.

642
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:29,900
My mother died in a plane crash in the andes when I was 6.

643
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,630
You did this on purpose.

644
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,630
You put Serena into your dress

645
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,230
- So you could sneak it into my show.  - No, I didn't. I swear.

646
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,060
When I expose your eve harrington ways,

647
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,030
Your bright future will be snuffed out like a candle.

648
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:53,130
Eleanor, Andrew Leon Talley is raving about the finale dress.

649
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,130
He said it was the perfect culmination to your line,

650
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,660
- Loved it.  - They loved the dress?

651
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,730
My dress?

652
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,130
Ooh 

653
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,800
Ooh 

654
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,230
Ooh, yes 

655
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,360
And I adapted one of your old patterns.

656
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,000
It's basically your design. Please take credit for it.

657
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,760
I am Eleanor Waldorf.

658
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,330
I do not have to take credit for a dress made by a child.

659
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,660
Mom, Jenny saved the show.

660
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,160
It was her idea to use the socialites.

661
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,100
And look. It's a smash success.

662
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,360
Take your bow.

663
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,860
Please?

664
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,200
What else are you gonna do, mom?

665
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:44,230
What the hell.

666
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,130
A guy's acting crazy outside, wants to be let in,

667
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,030
Says he's your father. Should I put him on the list?

668
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,660
Um, no.

669
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,200
When the phone rang in the dead of the night,

670
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:22,330
I expected a boo from Lucy the stewardess,

671
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,360
- Not a call from lockup.  - Yeah, look, I'm sorry about this.

672
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,730
I didn't have anywhere else to turn, really.

673
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,730
Police stations at midnight make me nostalgic for my youth.

674
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,730
So it turns out that guy you clocked dropped the charges.

675
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,160
Oh, good. That... that's a relief.

676
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,160
I'm proud of you, Humphrey. You really shook it up. Yeah.

677
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,800
Did you get Charlie Trout's secret in the process?

678
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:44,230
Uh, yeah, yeah. He thinks he killed his mother.

679
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,830
Bingo! You're gonna have a hell of a story.

680
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,560
Yeah, you know, I'm... I'm not gonna use it, though.

681
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,560
- What do you mean?  - Well, if I have to exploit people to be a good writer,

682
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,560
Then, you know, maybe... maybe I'm not a good writer.

683
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,060
I don't... I'd rather be safe than use people for art.

684
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,260
Harris was right when he cut you loose.

685
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,160
You'll always be second-rate.

686
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,160
Maybe, maybe, but you know what?

687
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,160
I have... I have an idea for a new story.

688
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,360
It's about an egomaniacal, washed-up writer

689
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,500
Who manipulates his prot.

690
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,500
It's a classic tale of disillusionment.

691
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:17,500
Good luck with that. I'll look for it in "reader's digest."

692
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:20,500
I can use it to prop up my pulitzers.

693
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:27,530
I would like to thank everyone

694
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,030
For making the show a spectacular success.

695
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,100
But most of all,

696
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,960
I would like to thank Jenny Humphrey,

697
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,530
The sensational Jenny Humphrey.

698
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,960
Without her hard work and talent,

699
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,030
The show literally would not have gone on.

700
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,360
To Jenny.

701
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,560
To Jenny.

702
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,800
To Jenny.

703
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,960
Serena, can we talk?

704
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,960
About what? How you tried to publicly humiliate me?

705
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,130
- You know about the dress.  - Yeah, Laurel told me.

706
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,500
She said it was an accident. Clearly, she doesn't know you.

707
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,730
I'm sorry.

708
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,900
I was hurt, okay?

709
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,930
Y-you blew off our most beloved tradition.

710
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,130
Just get over it, Blair.

711
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,560
Excuse me?

712
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,360
My whole life, I have been bending over backwards

713
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,730
To! Rotect your feelings.

714
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,330
And you know what? It's not my fault you're so insecure.

715
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,330
And I'm sure it's not your fault you're so conceited.

716
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,630
I'm just tired of trying to hold myself back

717
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,630
- So I don't outshine you.  - Oh, my god.

718
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,030
Can you hear the words that are coming out of your mouth?

719
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,760
Just the truth.

720
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,130
From now on, I'm gonna be who I am,

721
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,130
And if you can support that

722
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,760
And not be threatened and competitive, then great.

723
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,560
If not...

724
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,260
From now on, your privileges

725
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,300
- Consist of bread, water and school.  - You can't make me give up my job with Eleanor.

726
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:16,130
- Watch me.  - Dad, you pursued your music when you were young.

727
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,630
You didn't focus on school,

728
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,630
And you got what you wanted for a while.

729
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,630
- And I don't want my children repeating my mistakes.  - And if your career had taken off,

730
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,730
Then you wouldn't consider them mistakes.

731
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,060
- And maybe I'm just more...  - more talented than me? Believe me. I hope you are.

732
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,060
I hope you become a success at whatever it is you choose,

733
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,630
- After you finish school.  - Well, maybe that's not the path I want.

734
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,230
That you don't care about all the school you've missed?

735
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,960
No. I told her I'm not coming back.

736
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,860
If there's one thing I've learned,

737
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,500
It's that there would be no gossip without secrets.

738
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,660
# Give it a tug #

739
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,960
You might be brave enough to reveal your secret,

740
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,100
Only to have it used against you...

741
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:07,330
Or someone else's secret might affect you in unexpected ways.

742
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,930
# That hole is so steep #

743
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,430
There are some secrets you're only too happy to keep.

744
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,900
Others surface

745
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:21,260
Only to be buried away deeper than they were before.

745
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,100
But the most powerful secrets

746
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,860
are the truths you thought you could never reveal,

747
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,300
That once spoken, change everything.

748
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:34,860
# Tonight we raise the dead #

749
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,860
But don't worry, B.

750
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,400
The brightest stars burn out the fastest,

751
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,160
Or at least that's what I heard.

752
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,260
Waiting for a star to fall,

753
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,430
X.o.x.o., gossip girl.
