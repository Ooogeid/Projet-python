Gossip Girl here, your
one and only source

2
00:00:02,748 --> 00:00:05,278
into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite.

3
00:00:05,313 --> 00:00:07,825
Someone set Tripp up to
make him look like a hero.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,379
- You...
- This couldn't have worked any better.

5
00:00:10,414 --> 00:00:12,109
My husband is a Congressman.

6
00:00:12,144 --> 00:00:13,623
I have a crush on him.

7
00:00:13,658 --> 00:00:16,999
Now I don't know if I can
trust myself around him.

8
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:19,137
Something happened the night
of the Shepherd wedding.

9
00:00:19,172 --> 00:00:21,180
We're all aware what
happened that night.

10
00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:23,797
I think we got 14 out of 15.

11
00:00:23,832 --> 00:00:26,120
I'm not going with just one more to go.

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,923
As a famed literary
liar once told Oprah,

16
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,409
memory is subjective.

17
00:00:51,771 --> 00:00:53,218
Top of the morning.

18
00:01:19,928 --> 00:01:21,811
Up top. Yeah, there it is.

19
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:25,381
Memories can be embellished or denied.

20
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:26,837
Hey, Blair.

21
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:31,320
I don't know what you think you saw between
me and Tripp, but nothing is happening.

22
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,829
But as James Frey knows all too well...

23
00:01:34,864 --> 00:01:36,625
the truth always comes out.

24
00:01:37,026 --> 00:01:38,952
This is my 30th message.

25
00:01:39,693 --> 00:01:42,083
I don't want to fight
anymore. Please call me.

26
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:45,437
Here comes message 31.

27
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,858
Ugh. I don't converse
with liars or Lewinskys.

28
00:01:50,893 --> 00:01:54,039
Come on. Blair. You don't
know that you saw anything.

29
00:01:54,074 --> 00:01:56,673
In the second grade,
I saw our gym teacher

30
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,924
giving Laverne Glazer's
mom the glad eye.

31
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,471
Not only did it earn me the first
"a++" for gym in Constance history,

32
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:06,267
I learned that my sexual
tension radar is unparalleled.

33
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,489
Point ceded.

34
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:10,783
So is beatnik back?

35
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:14,028
Ew. No. I'm adding new
recruits to my student army.

36
00:02:14,063 --> 00:02:17,945
Apparently at N.Y.U., no one cares if your
forefathers made pumpkin pie at Plymouth.

37
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,997
They only care if they
made profits at Paramount.

38
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:22,362
Ahh. The Tisch kids.

39
00:02:22,786 --> 00:02:24,898
Spawn of moguls and movie stars.

40
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:28,922
Yesterday I sent a first edition "no
exit" script to their leader, Paul Hoffman.

41
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:31,380
Today I'll secure the alliance.

42
00:02:31,415 --> 00:02:33,355
- Care to tag along?
- Oh, I'd love to,

43
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,132
but a high-ranking diplomat has asked
me to show his son around New York.

44
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,385
I need to build up my
continental clientele,

45
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,909
so it looks like I'm
statue of liberty-bound.

46
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:45,594
Oh, the sacrifices we make for success.

47
00:02:45,796 --> 00:02:48,832
I'll think of a way to make
your day less boring later.

48
00:02:50,895 --> 00:02:53,397
- What, a threesome?
- Oh, yeah.

49
00:02:53,432 --> 00:02:56,564
Just me, Olivia, Vanessa... two
girls, four boobs and one Dan Humphrey.

50
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,103
- How awesome am I?
- Oh, how stupid can you be?

51
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,344
- What?
- Buddy, okay, I know things.

52
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:04,878
I...I've been to Europe.
Chuck Bass is my best friend.

53
00:03:04,913 --> 00:03:07,376
- Yeah.
- All right, the third person is supposed to be a stranger.

54
00:03:07,411 --> 00:03:09,527
No, the fact that it was
Vanessa is what made it so fun.

55
00:03:09,562 --> 00:03:12,845
Okay, the problem is during a
threesome, there's always a twosome

56
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,279
and a onesome going on.

57
00:03:14,314 --> 00:03:16,283
You know what? The
onesome was not so bad.

58
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:18,309
Okay, you may have enjoyed the show,

59
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:20,602
but let's face it, Vanessa...

60
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:23,830
is very vocal. It couldn't have been
easy for Olivia to hear all that.

61
00:03:23,865 --> 00:03:27,442
No. You know what? Olivia was fine. We
talked the next morning. And so is Vanessa.

62
00:03:27,477 --> 00:03:29,948
I mean, I haven't really seen her
much, but, uh, I'm... I'm sure she is.

63
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,104
- Why are you being such a buzzkill?
- Because you're lucky to have both of them in your life.

64
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:36,338
All right? Not only do
I not have a girlfriend,

65
00:03:36,373 --> 00:03:40,548
ever since Serena and I stopped speaking,
I don't even have a girl friend either.

66
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,892
You had both, and you blew it.

67
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,144
I did not. I did not.

68
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:50,064
Okay. Okay. In fact, you know what?
There she is, my still best friend.

69
00:03:50,323 --> 00:03:51,392
Ah, perfect.

70
00:03:51,744 --> 00:03:53,694
- Abrams.
- Hey, Dan.

71
00:03:54,832 --> 00:03:56,858
I've barely seen you this week.

72
00:03:56,893 --> 00:03:59,743
I feel like you've been
avoiding me since...

73
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:03,827
No. No, not at all. Uh, tonight at the
bowery... I think Morrissey is playing.

74
00:04:03,862 --> 00:04:07,392
So you want to go, just the
two of us, for old times' sake?

75
00:04:07,936 --> 00:04:09,378
Yeah, I'd love it.

76
00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:13,289
- So I'll see you tonight?
- Yeah, of course. Yeah.

77
00:04:13,512 --> 00:04:14,569
- Sorry.

78
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:21,883
Well, it didn't seem awkward at all.

79
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,318
Everything is... it's
fine. It really is.

80
00:04:24,353 --> 00:04:26,874
Give me a call if you
need me, which you will.

81
00:04:27,737 --> 00:04:32,292
Gaga's a Tisch alumni. Even if she doesn't
want to give a secret concert at the Bleecker,

82
00:04:32,327 --> 00:04:35,543
at least show me the
courtesy of writing back.

83
00:04:35,578 --> 00:04:37,191
Are you guys talking about Lady Gaga?

84
00:04:37,226 --> 00:04:41,751
No, Blair. I'm talking about Gaga
Ahmadinejad, First Lady of Iran.

85
00:04:42,712 --> 00:04:43,727
That's funny.

86
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,653
You know who likes sarcasm?

87
00:04:45,688 --> 00:04:47,688
My stepfather, Cyrus Rose,

88
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:51,431
big-time entertainment lawyer. Maybe
he could talk her into doing a show.

89
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:54,499
Uh, Blair, we all know who my father is,

90
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,510
and this girl here is Willa Weinstein.
If our fathers can't help us,

91
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:01,848
I doubt Cyrus Rose, whom
I've never heard of, can.

92
00:05:04,044 --> 00:05:06,289
What are you guys doing
for cabaret tonight?

93
00:05:06,324 --> 00:05:08,260
Fairy-tale theme is hard.

94
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:11,026
- Don't want to be trite.
- Cabaret?

95
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,365
I love cabaret...

96
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,075
and fairy tales.

97
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,736
- Princesses, queens...
- Uh, sorry, Blair. It's my cabaret,

98
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:21,128
and it's by invitation only.
All the spots are filled by...

99
00:05:21,544 --> 00:05:23,264
serious theater students.

100
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:30,038
I don't care how much money
they're offering. K.C.,

101
00:05:30,684 --> 00:05:33,006
"Bitches of Eastwick"
is a terrible idea.

102
00:05:35,464 --> 00:05:38,046
It's like "Heathers," but with witches.

103
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:43,061
I... ever since "E.K.4" isn't happening,
she's literally pushing me to take anything.

104
00:05:43,096 --> 00:05:45,995
Yeah, well, I thought... well, I'd hoped
that you'd, uh, you'd stick around now.

105
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:48,344
Well, that's my plan.

106
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:53,004
I'm so happy here, You know,
with my classes, and I have you.

107
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,095
And Vanessa.

108
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,288
And Vanessa.

109
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:59,813
And if I want to act, I
can do it here at N.Y.U.,

110
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:03,157
- You know, with the best theater department in the whole country.
- Yeah, absolutely.

111
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:07,392
Yeah, you know, speaking of
Tisch, um, tell me if I'm crazy,

112
00:06:07,427 --> 00:06:09,491
but I was thinking of applying to the,
uh, playwriting program for next year.

113
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:11,657
Dan, I don't think that's crazy at all.

114
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:13,885
I would have to write a
play by this Christmas break.

115
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,654
Well, I'll help you with
your application tonigh

116
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:19,249
I would love that, but, uh, tonight Vanessa
and I are gonna go see Morrissey at the bowery.

117
00:06:19,284 --> 00:06:21,284
It's a tradition we've had since seventh
grade. You know, we wear tight shirts,

118
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,884
we through gladiolus on stage.

119
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:25,835
Um, it's okay, right?

120
00:06:26,584 --> 00:06:28,399
Yes, of course.

121
00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:30,512
It's tradition.

122
00:06:34,455 --> 00:06:36,255
I'm gonna go grab a coffee, okay?

123
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,029
I'll see you later.

124
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:39,966
Okay, uh...

125
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:43,265
I thought we were gonna
grab coffee together.

126
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:46,299
What about Brad Alexander?

127
00:06:46,502 --> 00:06:48,131
His mother said he's single.

128
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,718
Uh, yeah, 'cause he gave
six girls from Nightingale

129
00:06:51,753 --> 00:06:53,753
the gonorrhea of the throat last year.

130
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:55,569
What are you two doing?

131
00:06:55,604 --> 00:06:59,096
Oh, we're trying to find Jenny a date
for the horticultural society gala.

132
00:06:59,131 --> 00:07:01,479
Don't worry, dad. I'm
over Upper East Side guys.

133
00:07:01,514 --> 00:07:03,256
I'm looking to expand my horizons.

134
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,810
I'll be just a minute.

135
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,637
Charles, how are you?

136
00:07:07,642 --> 00:07:09,275
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

137
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,387
Thanks, but I'm on my
way to the planetarium.

138
00:07:11,392 --> 00:07:13,793
- I was just dropping off those papers you needed.
- Thank you.

139
00:07:13,798 --> 00:07:17,198
Did Chuck Bass just say he
was going to the planetarium?

140
00:07:17,325 --> 00:07:20,189
Mm-Hmm. I'm entertaining a hotel
guest, the son of an ambassador.

141
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,740
He's waiting in the foyer.

142
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,100
Well, maybe Jenny could show him around.

143
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,249
You did say you wanted
to expand your horizons.

144
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,157
Yeah. I can do it.

145
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,820
But you owe me.

146
00:07:47,045 --> 00:07:48,209
With pleasure.

147
00:07:52,354 --> 00:07:54,704
What is gonorrhea of the throat?

148
00:07:59,323 --> 00:08:00,586
Olivia.

149
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:02,382
Just the starlet I was hoping to find.

150
00:08:02,387 --> 00:08:03,547
Hi, Blair.

151
00:08:04,238 --> 00:08:07,114
Uh, dorota need to use my outlet
for your towel warmer again?

152
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,059
Actually, I have a question.

153
00:08:09,064 --> 00:08:11,906
How do I win over shallow,
superficial actors?

154
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:14,965
Calling them "shallow" and
"superficial" didn't work?

155
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,228
I'm serious.

156
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:19,439
They're all doing this cabaret
thing tonight. I wasn't even invited.

157
00:08:19,444 --> 00:08:21,292
Not that I have anything to perform.

158
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:26,763
Well, you're in luck.
I... I was invited.

159
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:29,667
I guess being a movie
star has a certain cache.

160
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:31,873
I may have read that at the dentist.

161
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:36,628
More importantly, I am dating a guy who
needs an opportunity to write a play.

162
00:08:37,793 --> 00:08:39,852
He'll just need to
clear his schedule first.

163
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:53,044
Hey. Tripp.

164
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,241
Uh, how are you? I was, uh,

165
00:08:56,853 --> 00:09:00,072
just leaving you a note about
the, uh, "Observer" article.

166
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,407
Oh. Great.

167
00:09:05,282 --> 00:09:08,899
I thought you wouldn't be here, which
is what it said on your schedule.

168
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:11,820
Right. Um, my meeting ended early.

169
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:14,665
- Good.
- Yeah.

170
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,320
Then you'll have time to read my note.

171
00:09:21,682 --> 00:09:25,531
You know, this, um, this
really shouldn't be so awkward.

172
00:09:25,536 --> 00:09:27,536
It won't be for too long.

173
00:09:27,603 --> 00:09:29,652
Big move to D.C. tomorrow.

174
00:09:30,347 --> 00:09:32,404
I thought that wasn't until January.

175
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:37,082
Maureen wanted to be there for the
holidays... the parties, the networking.

176
00:09:37,772 --> 00:09:39,829
It's probably for the best, though.

177
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,860
I've been pretty...

178
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,059
distracted.

179
00:09:45,137 --> 00:09:47,887
- Yeah, tell me about it.
- Uh, last week...

180
00:09:49,124 --> 00:09:50,782
Nothing happened.

181
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,760
Then why does it feel like it did?

182
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,015
Maybe we should just, uh...

183
00:09:59,134 --> 00:10:01,284
avoid each other until you leave.

184
00:10:05,415 --> 00:10:07,388
There you two are.

185
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:09,954
Honey.

186
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:13,265
I just found out they had to move
the freshman spouses luncheon.

187
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,342
Um, so I'd have to leave
in an hour. Is that okay?

188
00:10:15,347 --> 00:10:17,020
Yeah, of course. I'll see you tomorrow.

189
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:19,325
I'll just have Jeanne finish packing.

190
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,856
But all that's left is the home office.

191
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:23,909
Serena should help you.

192
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:27,293
There's some private family
stuff, and I trust you.

193
00:10:28,513 --> 00:10:30,723
That's not really

194
00:10:30,728 --> 00:10:32,460
in Serena's job description.

195
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,197
She doesn't mind. do you?

196
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:40,804
Now who wants to take their
favorite wife to brunch?

197
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:43,059
Don't forget yourself, Congressman.

198
00:10:43,335 --> 00:10:47,104
Your marriage could wind up
in "a million little pieces."

199
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:55,739
Mom, I know how much you love
grandfather. And I get it.

200
00:10:55,808 --> 00:10:58,580
It's not like I haven't forgiven
my father a few times. But

201
00:10:58,585 --> 00:11:00,495
do not let him manipulate you.

202
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,784
He was the one behind the Hudson thing.

203
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:03,983
Who else could it be?

204
00:11:03,988 --> 00:11:05,646
Hello? Nate?

205
00:11:07,107 --> 00:11:08,212
I'm sorry. Mom?

206
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:11,563
Yeah, I'd love to hear
your new information,

207
00:11:11,568 --> 00:11:14,168
but, um, listen, I gotta go.
I'll call you later, okay?

208
00:11:14,983 --> 00:11:18,833
I know I'm not your
favorite person right now,

209
00:11:19,168 --> 00:11:23,727
but it's me, Nate, and... and there's
no one else I can talk to about this.

210
00:11:25,405 --> 00:11:26,655
I, uh...

211
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,821
I think I may be about to get
involved with a married man.

212
00:11:31,826 --> 00:11:34,559
Why am I the only one you can talk to?

213
00:11:34,564 --> 00:11:36,414
Because it's Tripp.

214
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:45,016
Vanessa, hey.

215
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:46,271
Hey.

216
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:49,373
I figured you'd be back to get
some clean clothes at some point.

217
00:11:49,378 --> 00:11:50,582
Yeah.

218
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:53,472
I know, we've barely seen each other.

219
00:11:53,477 --> 00:11:55,228
Dan and I have just been...

220
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:56,733
busy, you know?

221
00:11:58,149 --> 00:11:59,149
So...

222
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,932
You're not..

223
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:03,045
avoiding me because

224
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,643
of the whole...

225
00:12:05,472 --> 00:12:06,499
What?

226
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,676
Oh, my god. Uh, no. I...

227
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:12,443
Come on. No.

228
00:12:13,095 --> 00:12:14,532
Okay, great,

229
00:12:14,537 --> 00:12:18,387
because I was totally freaking out
before I ran into Dan this morning.

230
00:12:19,134 --> 00:12:20,946
But he was the same old Dan.

231
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:24,024
You know, tonight we're going to,
like, our fifth Morrissey show,

232
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:28,379
and I still have tickets from
our first one in seventh grade.

233
00:12:29,234 --> 00:12:30,912
um, actually...

234
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,090
I feel really bad about that.

235
00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:38,186
Um, a month ago, I signed Dan and
me up for the bleecker inn cabaret,

236
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:39,764
and it's tonight.

237
00:12:40,815 --> 00:12:42,730
Um, we would totally blow it off,

238
00:12:42,735 --> 00:12:46,885
but Dan wants to apply to Tisch, and
it's just really great exposure for him.

239
00:12:47,507 --> 00:12:48,661
Oh, yeah.

240
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,967
Okay. Sorry about Morrissey.

241
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:57,803
I just don't get it.
I mean, Tripp? really?

242
00:12:57,808 --> 00:13:00,033
Two months ago, you were
all over Carter Baizen.

243
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:03,227
Tripp has sacrificed so
much to get where he is.

244
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:04,707
I mean, we all have.

245
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:06,621
He can't just throw it away for you.

246
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:09,814
Yeah, and he's fighting it, and so am I.

247
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:12,680
I can literally feel my
heart thump when I see him.

248
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:16,104
I haven't felt this way since I
was 13, with Jude Law in "Alfie."

249
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:19,159
Yeah, well, you're
not 13 anymore, Serena.

250
00:13:20,955 --> 00:13:25,429
You know, I thought that, uh, whatever
happened between us I could still count on you,

251
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:27,922
But I guess I was wrong.

252
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,113
Hey.

253
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:36,192
You're right. I'm sorry.

254
00:13:36,585 --> 00:13:38,535
You can count on me, always.

255
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:41,638
So, Belgium, huh?

256
00:13:41,643 --> 00:13:45,732
I bet they have really good waffles.
My family's really into waffles.

257
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:47,742
Yeah, I've barely tasted them. We left

258
00:13:47,747 --> 00:13:50,361
when I was 4 so my father
could work on the Oslo accord.

259
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:53,376
He worked on the Oslo
accord? That sounds major.

260
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:56,525
Yeah, clearly more major
than being a father, but...

261
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,530
right.

262
00:13:57,535 --> 00:14:00,293
So, uh, what do you want to do?
There's the boathouse for lunch,

263
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,762
or we could walk on
over to Jean Georges.

264
00:14:02,797 --> 00:14:04,584
You know, I have a plan.

265
00:14:05,657 --> 00:14:06,914
It'll be fun.

266
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:13,752
Oh, my God. Don't... don't look now, but
those are... those are the Chapin mean girls.

267
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:15,692
Hi.

268
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,424
They're gonna die of jealousy.

269
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:31,106
Toy sail... sailboats? Really?

270
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,750
Come on. It might be cool in Belgium,

271
00:14:34,785 --> 00:14:37,347
but in Manhattan, only
little kids do that.

272
00:14:46,358 --> 00:14:48,326
You have eight hours
to write and rehearse

273
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:50,574
your reimagined fairy tale before tech.

274
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:55,192
Lots of Tisch faculty and alums
will be there, plus my legit agent.

275
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,836
So, please, don't embarrass me.

276
00:14:57,871 --> 00:14:59,153
Good luck.

277
00:15:00,311 --> 00:15:02,357
- See?
- Yeah, you're... yeah, you're right. You're right.

278
00:15:02,392 --> 00:15:04,373
This is gonna be a great opportunity.

279
00:15:04,408 --> 00:15:09,014
- All right, so which fairy tale do you think I should...
- Totally "Snow White."

280
00:15:10,261 --> 00:15:11,911
sorry I'm late.

281
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:15,198
Uh, uh, what? What is she doing here?

282
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:16,413
Silly.

283
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:20,527
I'm the producer, costar and director.

284
00:15:20,758 --> 00:15:23,126
Yeah, it was... it
was her idea, actually.

285
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:25,047
My brilliant idea.

286
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:29,257
A musical featuring the songs
of Tisch alumna Lady Gaga.

287
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:31,243
Paul loves his Gaga.

288
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:34,755
I'm gonna go pick his brain about
what songs he'd think work best

289
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,025
thematically.

290
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:41,837
Okay. um... what's...
what's going on here?

291
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:45,443
You want me to cancel on Vanessa, who's
gonna be justifiably furious, to... to write

292
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:49,184
a "Snow White"/ Lady Gaga musical
to be directed by Blair Waldorf?

293
00:15:49,413 --> 00:15:53,083
Listen, I know that her idea
is... is kind of out of the box,

294
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:56,195
but if you pull this off,
everyone's gonna be talking about it.

295
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,340
And I talked to Vanessa. She's
totally cool about tonight.

296
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,748
Wait. S... so you already told her?

297
00:16:02,783 --> 00:16:07,056
I... I ran into her in... in our
room, and she was fine. I promise.

298
00:16:09,615 --> 00:16:11,632
Leave a message, and
I might listen to it.

299
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:13,859
Chuck, could you find another
way to drum up business?

300
00:16:13,894 --> 00:16:17,676
Because this belgian bore has been playing in
the park for the past half-hour with his dinghy.

301
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:20,927
- I have a reputation.
- All right. all set.

302
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,571
What now? Balloon animals?

303
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:25,168
By the way, you took the wrong boat.

304
00:16:25,203 --> 00:16:29,320
Uh, no. Actually, this is,
uh, the one with the cash.

305
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,897
- Mine had the "E" in it.
- What?

306
00:16:32,397 --> 00:16:34,464
Sorry if I was boring you.

307
00:16:34,706 --> 00:16:39,328
You still want to get some lunch and
we can go find those, uh, Chapin girls?

308
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,381
Okay, man, so... so get this.
I had plans with Vanessa tonight,

309
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:48,269
right? But then Olivia signed me up to
do this cabaret thing with her and Blair.

310
00:16:48,304 --> 00:16:52,557
Oh, yeah. that's post-threesome stage
one, where in one, if not both girls,

311
00:16:52,592 --> 00:16:54,470
try to prove to the
other who you belong to.

312
00:16:54,505 --> 00:16:56,880
- All right, so what do I do?
- Oh, you gotta prove to Olivia that you

313
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:01,119
and Vanessa are still just friends, despite
the fact that you've seen each other's business.

314
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,184
- You good?
- Yeah, thanks, man.

315
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:05,933
All right, later.

316
00:17:07,454 --> 00:17:11,021
Oh. Dan. Girl problems.
You don't even want to know.

317
00:17:11,056 --> 00:17:12,947
It sounds like you're
everyone's therapist today.

318
00:17:12,982 --> 00:17:15,276
Yeah, well, affairs with
married people, love triangles...

319
00:17:15,311 --> 00:17:19,297
Just so happens everyone's problems
are well within my area of expertise.

320
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,538
Okay, you ready?

321
00:17:35,373 --> 00:17:36,635
Serena, hey.

322
00:17:37,032 --> 00:17:39,217
Uh, what do you like on your pizza?

323
00:17:39,252 --> 00:17:41,523
Actually, I'm... I'm not coming over.

324
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:44,983
I had a feeling you'd call.

325
00:17:46,477 --> 00:17:48,662
I can't say I'm not
disappointed, though.

326
00:17:48,697 --> 00:17:53,001
Come on, Tripp. You know it's not a
good idea for us to be alone all night.

327
00:17:53,566 --> 00:17:55,011
No, you're right.

328
00:17:56,252 --> 00:17:58,519
I don't want to go
without saying goodbye.

329
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,556
Could we maybe just get some lunch?

330
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:04,497
Lunch? Yeah. I... you know, I...

331
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:07,774
Um... I actually don't think

332
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:10,961
that I can. But travel
safe, congressman.

333
00:18:10,996 --> 00:18:12,880
- Bye.
- Good work.

334
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:17,017
I'm gonna be here to keep you strong. Until Tripp
leaves, I'm not gonna let you out of my sight.

335
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,168
Mr. Van Der Bilt, Mrs.
Archibald is here to see you.

336
00:18:24,378 --> 00:18:25,460
My aunt?

337
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:31,666
- I'm kind of busy. Can she come back later?
- No, she said it was important.

338
00:18:35,336 --> 00:18:38,762
- I thought you had a play to write.
- Listen, I'm sorry about Morrissey,

339
00:18:38,797 --> 00:18:41,699
But I told Olivia this morning that I
wanted to apply to Tisch, and so she saw

340
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:44,296
this cabaret thing,
and she signed us up.

341
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,631
- Wait. This morning?
- Yeah

342
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:49,395
You know, it had nothing to
do with our plans tonight.

343
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,765
- I mean, this is -- it's a big
opportunity for me. - Of course.

344
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:55,241
Yeah, so, um, I-I'm
gonna need your help.

345
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,526
Inspired by miss GaGa's lyrics,
I've written a stirical commentary.

346
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:06,205
About fame, glamour and our society's
obsession with the shiny new thing.

347
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,713
Humphrey, I'm surprised.
This isn't horrible.

348
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,200
You play the aging queen,

349
00:19:10,235 --> 00:19:12,981
a fading but talented rock
star who earned her success.

350
00:19:13,016 --> 00:19:16,252
Olivio, Snow White, a young up-and-comer
who's trying to steal the queen's thunder

351
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:18,521
- by being outrageous and sexy.
- I like it.

352
00:19:18,556 --> 00:19:22,661
Yeah. Uh, Amalia, Sophie, twins...

353
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:24,783
You're the struggling dwarf boy band.

354
00:19:24,818 --> 00:19:28,018
I'll be Prince of Charming records,
trying to find his next big pop star.

355
00:19:28,053 --> 00:19:31,992
So I, you know, I think it, uh, I think it
kinda works. Don't get too cocky, Humphrey.

356
00:19:32,027 --> 00:19:33,807
We still have your subpar
acting to deal with.

357
00:19:33,842 --> 00:19:35,571
Let's meet back here in a half an hour.

358
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:38,043
Everyone off book so I can
block. actually, I've found

359
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:41,001
a more experienced director
more suited to the project.

360
00:19:41,036 --> 00:19:43,279
Julie Taymor? close.

361
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:47,585
- No.
- Vanessa?

362
00:19:53,748 --> 00:19:58,128
V., I am so stupid for not
thinking of you earlier.

363
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:02,389
We're so lucky to have you to
bring Dan's amazing words to life.

364
00:20:02,424 --> 00:20:05,078
- Wait until you read this.
- I already did. Dan always shows

365
00:20:05,113 --> 00:20:07,213
me early drafts of his work.

366
00:20:08,462 --> 00:20:11,901
Well... well, I mean, I, you know, I had
to get her onboard, show her somethin'.

367
00:20:12,174 --> 00:20:14,545
Great. Well, if you need any pointers,

368
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,765
I've worked with some of
the world's best directors.

369
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,833
Sure. If I want to turn anyone into a
bat, I'll... I'll let you know. Thank you.

370
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:25,563
- Dan?
- Yeah?

371
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:27,489
When girls live together,

372
00:20:27,524 --> 00:20:29,874
sometimes their cycles sync up.

373
00:20:30,844 --> 00:20:34,654
No hormones... not yours or theirs...
will get in the way of my cabaret.

374
00:20:34,689 --> 00:20:36,139
It'll be fine, Blair.

375
00:20:36,928 --> 00:20:40,195
What exactly does an
upper east side queen do?

376
00:20:40,451 --> 00:20:42,209
You wear designer clothes

377
00:20:42,244 --> 00:20:43,815
and boss people around?

378
00:20:44,755 --> 00:20:45,760
No.

379
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:49,283
I go to parties and openings and stuff.

380
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:52,613
Where you wear designer
clothes and boss people around?

381
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:56,490
Sounds like kind of a yawn.

382
00:20:57,074 --> 00:21:00,346
Well, yeah, I guess compared to
being an international drug dealer.

383
00:21:00,702 --> 00:21:04,312
What's the deal with that anyway? I mean, you don't
need the money. Your dad's an ambassador, right?

384
00:21:04,322 --> 00:21:06,797
Exactly, which means we don't
have to go through customs,

385
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,238
they don't search our bags
when we come in from the Hague.

386
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:11,566
Besides of the added
satisfaction of knowing my father

387
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:14,147
would have to suffer
if I were ever caught.

388
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:18,361
A little bit of danger is
what makes life worth living,

389
00:21:18,396 --> 00:21:21,702
and you had your very first
taste today, Queen Jenny.

390
00:21:21,884 --> 00:21:23,909
It was kind of thrilling.

391
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:29,581
If you mean that, some friends are gonna
meet me a little later to refuel my boat.

392
00:21:30,928 --> 00:21:32,332
You in?

393
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,364
High school was so much easier.

394
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:36,735
Yeah, in some ways.

395
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:40,503
Well, I wasn't attracted to
married men. Yeah, but I was.

396
00:21:40,513 --> 00:21:43,294
Well, not... not men, obviously.

397
00:21:44,182 --> 00:21:47,620
Lady Catherine... that was my first
experience being someone's fake girlfriend.

398
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,345
- Who knew I'd do it as a profession?
- Well, if it makes you feel any better, you were

399
00:21:50,355 --> 00:21:51,919
a great fake girlfriend.

400
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:53,274
Oh, my God. You got...

401
00:21:55,207 --> 00:21:58,194
It's, like, all over your... no. No.

402
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,432
- No. No.
- It's, like, you got... no.

403
00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:02,454
It's like... just... here. Stop.

404
00:22:03,194 --> 00:22:04,708
- You're good.
- Thank you.

405
00:22:04,718 --> 00:22:06,353
Yeah.

406
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:10,779
Oh. It's, uh, it's Tripp.

407
00:22:11,223 --> 00:22:14,335
- Oh, you can't.
- But what if it's important?

408
00:22:14,345 --> 00:22:16,516
Serena, just give me the phone.

409
00:22:16,977 --> 00:22:19,149
Now you can't talk about him
or think about him or see him.

410
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:21,650
What... what are you gonna do, tie
me to a chair until his plane leaves?

411
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,287
I'm gonna take you on a bar
crawl, and we are getting drunk.

412
00:22:24,297 --> 00:22:27,035
Okay, like, really, really drunk.

413
00:22:27,594 --> 00:22:30,753
- Deal?
- Deal. You're the best.

414
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,137
Oh, snow,

415
00:22:35,374 --> 00:22:38,638
have this apple martini before
your VMA performance tonight.

416
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:39,963
I promise

417
00:22:39,973 --> 00:22:41,643
it's not poisoned.

418
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,343
Okay, dwarves, that's your cue.

419
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,878
You know, I think the dwarves
should be in the front.

420
00:22:51,863 --> 00:22:54,298
Okay. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me.

421
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,819
Um, no one's gonna be able to see me.

422
00:22:56,829 --> 00:23:00,244
Yeah, well, this moment really
is about the dwarves, right Dan?

423
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:01,587
Yeah, well, I mean,

424
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:04,224
it's called "Snow White,"
so technically it's...

425
00:23:04,234 --> 00:23:05,854
Of course you would take her side.

426
00:23:05,864 --> 00:23:07,055
- What?
- Well, he's right.

427
00:23:07,065 --> 00:23:10,138
- I'm not standing in the back.
- It was just a suggestion.

428
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:16,817
Boxing me out is one of
Vanessa's favorite activities.

429
00:23:16,827 --> 00:23:20,607
- What did you say?
- All right. Okay, girls, let's calm down,

430
00:23:20,617 --> 00:23:22,213
talk rationally.

431
00:23:22,223 --> 00:23:25,395
You're the one who signed up
for this cabaret to box me out.

432
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:26,716
Are you kidding me?

433
00:23:26,841 --> 00:23:28,851
You're the one who boxed me out today,

434
00:23:28,861 --> 00:23:30,911
with your Morrissey plans.

435
00:23:30,921 --> 00:23:32,652
And that night.

436
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,975
- What?
- What are you talking about?

437
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,298
Vanessa, you're in love with Dan,

438
00:23:44,308 --> 00:23:46,883
- and everybody here knows it.
- It is true.

439
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:50,428
Olivia, that... that's crazy. Come on.

440
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:53,483
Okay, I don't need to put
up with any of this. I quit.

441
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:55,864
Oh, no, you don't. I quit.

442
00:23:56,409 --> 00:24:00,448
What is going on? Did you bozos
have a threesome or something?

443
00:24:01,214 --> 00:24:02,224
Oh, god.

444
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:04,060
How stupid can you be?

445
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,886
The third person is always
supposed to be a stranger.

446
00:24:05,896 --> 00:24:08,415
Blair, look, this is my mess. I can...
I'm... I'm gonna go talk to t he girls.

447
00:24:08,425 --> 00:24:10,174
In which order? Hmm?

448
00:24:11,425 --> 00:24:12,617
Exactly.

449
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:15,371
You're gonna have to
tech all by yourself.

450
00:24:15,406 --> 00:24:19,043
I have an army to build,
a school to take over

451
00:24:19,437 --> 00:24:21,452
and girls to blackmail.

452
00:24:21,913 --> 00:24:24,644
Uh-Oh, playwright.
Better whip out your pen.

453
00:24:24,654 --> 00:24:28,739
It looks like this cabaret
just became a one-man show.

454
00:24:30,818 --> 00:24:31,851
Olivia,

455
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,168
I'm not asking you to do cabaret for me.

456
00:24:35,178 --> 00:24:39,005
I'm asking you to do it for
all the tweens of this world.

457
00:24:39,015 --> 00:24:41,173
My fans don't care if I do cabaret.

458
00:24:41,183 --> 00:24:44,326
But they'll care if they hear their
favorite queen of the dead had a...

459
00:24:44,336 --> 00:24:46,970
ménage with disgusting Dan Humphrey

460
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,809
and his celebutante girlfriend.

461
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:52,981
Do you really want everyone here to know
that alterna-Chick Abrams is literally a star?

462
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,367
First I'll text TMZ...

463
00:24:55,943 --> 00:24:57,478
then Gossip Girl.

464
00:24:58,364 --> 00:25:01,416
Oh, and the town crier
in Nowheresville, Vermont,

465
00:25:01,426 --> 00:25:03,842
so your parents find out.

466
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:04,920
So...

467
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:07,297
What's it gonna be?

468
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:21,166
Do you realize we haven't
been out drinking alone since,

469
00:25:21,176 --> 00:25:23,914
- uh....
- Since the Shepherd wedding.

470
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:26,012
Yeah,

471
00:25:26,337 --> 00:25:29,178
- the night that everything changed.
- Yeah.

472
00:25:30,308 --> 00:25:33,457
Maybe we should get some food and
sober up before something happens.

473
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:35,958
Come on, Nate. It's been
three and a half years.

474
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:38,830
I can control myself if you can.

475
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,419
- Another round, please.
- You got it.

476
00:25:42,595 --> 00:25:46,661
- Saved by the bell.
- Hold on one second. I'll be, uh, I'll be right back.

477
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:49,077
- Hey.
- Nate.

478
00:25:49,686 --> 00:25:51,726
I just found out...

479
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:57,078
grandfather wasn't behind "Hudson hero."

480
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,541
It was Maureen.

481
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,444
Your mom just told me.

482
00:26:00,454 --> 00:26:02,189
No. You're kidding me.

483
00:26:02,336 --> 00:26:04,475
I'm so sorry, Nate.

484
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:07,851
- I let you take the fall.
- What are you... don't worry about me,

485
00:26:07,861 --> 00:26:09,594
Tripp. It's you.

486
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:12,744
What are you gonna do?

487
00:26:12,754 --> 00:26:14,086
I don't know.

488
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:16,314
I can never trust her again.

489
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,766
I don't know if I even
want to see her again.

490
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:21,026
Of course, you're angry.

491
00:26:21,036 --> 00:26:23,192
Okay, Tripp, but she's
your wife. All right?

492
00:26:23,537 --> 00:26:26,459
Any kind of separation
this early in the term

493
00:26:26,469 --> 00:26:28,052
could affect your reelection.

494
00:26:28,062 --> 00:26:31,746
Reelection is the last
thing on my mind right now.

495
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,764
I just need to clear my head.

496
00:26:35,507 --> 00:26:37,554
- But you're out.
- No, I'm just at the Brandy library with a friend.

497
00:26:37,564 --> 00:26:41,829
Listen, hang in there, and
I'll call you later, okay?

498
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,172
Was that Dan again?

499
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:51,668
Yeah, the guy's

500
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:54,446
got the most complicated love
life. how about that round?

501
00:26:54,456 --> 00:26:57,187
Now there's the Nate I remember.

502
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,160
Oh, by the way, Eugene,
uh, Jenny. Jenny, Eugene.

503
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,394
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Cool. see you, boss.

504
00:27:22,046 --> 00:27:23,079
Good.

505
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,392
My guy is here.

506
00:27:25,402 --> 00:27:27,812
Here here? Like he's
coming over to the table?

507
00:27:28,018 --> 00:27:32,657
Where would you suggest we do it? In
the alley, with the cops and the cameras?

508
00:27:35,635 --> 00:27:39,074
I understand if you want to leave
or, you know, go to a-another table.

509
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:42,327
No. I'm good.

510
00:27:49,818 --> 00:27:53,026
Granny... why are your teeth so...

511
00:27:54,096 --> 00:27:55,560
big?

512
00:27:56,728 --> 00:27:58,600
What if they don't show up?

513
00:27:58,781 --> 00:28:00,292
They will.

514
00:28:03,122 --> 00:28:06,423
Oh, that's the "show must go on" spirit.

515
00:28:09,315 --> 00:28:11,995
We're up next. I'm gonna go
make sure the dwarves are ready.

516
00:28:12,032 --> 00:28:16,035
And I have a little treat
for Paul I need to set up.

517
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:20,515
Hey. I'm... I'm glad you
decided to come tonight.

518
00:28:20,531 --> 00:28:23,424
Well, Blair didn't really
give me much choice.

519
00:28:23,474 --> 00:28:27,044
Look, uh, Vanessa and
I are just friends.

520
00:28:27,078 --> 00:28:31,233
She has no feelings for me. I'm positive. In fact,
I made the same mistake when you went to Japan.

521
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:34,237
So, you know, whatever you...

522
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:37,857
think you saw during our... our thing,

523
00:28:38,449 --> 00:28:42,328
- uh, it wasn't from her.
- Yeah, no. You're right.

524
00:28:42,896 --> 00:28:45,325
Right. See? I told you.

525
00:28:45,383 --> 00:28:47,818
It wasn't from her.

526
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:50,314
It was from you.

527
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:54,761
I sat up to take my
shirt off. I look over,

528
00:28:55,854 --> 00:28:59,491
and... you were looking at Vanessa
like you've never looked at me.

529
00:29:01,786 --> 00:29:04,120
And then you kissed her, like...

530
00:29:06,116 --> 00:29:09,900
- like you've never kissed me.
- No. That's...

531
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,307
that little thing? That
was hardly even a kiss.

532
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:17,647
That you even know what I'm talking
about proves that it happened.

533
00:29:20,082 --> 00:29:22,358
If you just let yourself,

534
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:25,428
you'll see that your
feelings for her are real...

535
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:28,686
and you should stop kidding yourself.

536
00:29:29,152 --> 00:29:30,868
Hey, Prince Charming.

537
00:29:30,874 --> 00:29:34,506
Looks like it's time for you
to look in the enchanted mirror.

538
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:38,920
Platinum record on the wall,

539
00:29:38,992 --> 00:29:42,061
who's the most talented of us all?

540
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,711
Though your voice is as clear as day,

541
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:47,664
your dance moves are quite pass?

542
00:29:47,888 --> 00:29:52,470
And Snow White's youth and sex appeal
means she'll get the record deal.

543
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:03,196
* She's Pitch *

544
00:30:03,365 --> 00:30:06,344
* I am bitchy. *

545
00:30:06,367 --> 00:30:09,603
My, what talent you small people have.

546
00:30:09,663 --> 00:30:12,983
If only there were a vampy
young vixen to front you,

547
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,160
we'd all be swimming in
online sales. Luckily...

548
00:30:16,234 --> 00:30:18,709
I happen to be dating one.

549
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,827
* I wanna kiss you *

550
00:30:21,855 --> 00:30:25,569
* But if I do, then I
might miss you, babe *

551
00:30:26,155 --> 00:30:28,686
* It's complicated and stupid *

552
00:30:28,709 --> 00:30:31,247
* Got my ass squeezed by sexy cupid *

553
00:30:31,266 --> 00:30:34,161
* Guess he wants to
play, wants to play *

554
00:30:34,184 --> 00:30:36,478
* A love game, a love game *

555
00:30:36,488 --> 00:30:39,765
* A love game, a love
game, a love game *

556
00:30:39,813 --> 00:30:43,281
* A love game, a love
game, a love game *

557
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:47,585
So you guys met at boarding
school? That's cool.

558
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:50,609
What?

559
00:30:51,576 --> 00:30:53,010
Right.

560
00:30:53,056 --> 00:30:55,758
Yeah, eighth grade, Le Rosey.

561
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:59,228
- Good times.
- Yeah.

562
00:31:05,517 --> 00:31:08,001
Um, it was nice to meet you.
I'm gonna use the ladies room.

563
00:31:08,012 --> 00:31:10,661
No, no, no. Hey, sit down.
Don't go empty-handed.

564
00:31:10,671 --> 00:31:13,754
Here. Just, uh, test the product, yeah?

565
00:31:14,385 --> 00:31:16,552
That won't be necessary.

566
00:31:17,094 --> 00:31:19,699
Ch... Chuck, what are you doing here?

567
00:31:19,854 --> 00:31:22,567
After I got your message,
I had housekeeping

568
00:31:22,566 --> 00:31:24,933
do an early turndown
service on Damien's room.

569
00:31:25,345 --> 00:31:27,536
That's where they found his stash.

570
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:30,704
I've had my own experience in the
boat pond. I'm taking you home.

571
00:31:30,741 --> 00:31:33,521
You and your father have until
noon to collect your luggage.

572
00:31:33,526 --> 00:31:35,203
After that, it's in the river.

573
00:31:35,297 --> 00:31:37,929
Chuck, you're totally
overreacting. I'm really fine.

574
00:31:37,957 --> 00:31:41,102
Dude, the lady said she's fine.

575
00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:44,624
Dude...

576
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,802
I'm Chuck Bass.

577
00:31:46,837 --> 00:31:49,872
Even Europeans must
know what that means.

578
00:32:00,026 --> 00:32:02,321
Well, now that I've added
a disco-electro pop beat

579
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:04,287
to Snow White's love ballad

580
00:32:04,308 --> 00:32:06,227
and put your voices through auto-tune,

581
00:32:06,261 --> 00:32:08,794
It's time to take over the land.

582
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:12,643
Let's have some fun. This beat is sick.

583
00:32:12,652 --> 00:32:15,526
* I wanna take a ride
on your disco stick *

584
00:32:17,051 --> 00:32:19,302
That's her cue. Where the hell is she?

585
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:21,283
I have no idea.

586
00:32:21,718 --> 00:32:23,926
* I wanna take a ride
on your disco stick *

587
00:32:23,937 --> 00:32:26,022
Well... well, y... you know
what? The disco stick tends to be

588
00:32:26,035 --> 00:32:28,629
an unreliable form of transportation.

589
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:31,146
It, uh, it breaks down a lot.

590
00:32:31,189 --> 00:32:32,620
- What... what are you doing?
- Get in.

591
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,673
Yes.

592
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,812
Oh... Prince, here I am... Snow White.

593
00:32:40,757 --> 00:32:44,310
Oh. And I... and I got plastic surgery
and colored my hair, like you suggested.

594
00:32:44,321 --> 00:32:47,080
Oh, right. Right. Well,
you look fantastic.

595
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,674
You know, it took me a long time

596
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:57,312
to get over what happened
with us that night.

597
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,911
I actually, uh...

598
00:33:01,602 --> 00:33:02,951
Well...

599
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:05,800
two years ago at the masquerade ball,

600
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,179
I tried to tell you I loved you.

601
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:11,125
It turns out I told Jenny Humphrey.

602
00:33:11,243 --> 00:33:14,045
She was wearing your mask.

603
00:33:16,383 --> 00:33:18,984
You... you loved me?

604
00:33:21,756 --> 00:33:23,620
Of course I did.

605
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:26,465
Serena, you're the most beautiful,

606
00:33:26,524 --> 00:33:29,774
amazing, alive person I've ever known.

607
00:33:30,698 --> 00:33:32,045
Nate.

608
00:33:37,585 --> 00:33:40,378
I hope I'm not interrupting something.

609
00:33:46,547 --> 00:33:49,234
Platinum record on the wall,

610
00:33:49,257 --> 00:33:51,673
it's me now who have it all.

611
00:33:51,682 --> 00:33:54,479
Just as long as true love's kiss

612
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,994
doesn't wake this coked-up miss.

613
00:33:57,016 --> 00:33:59,985
Oh, if only the prince would kiss her...

614
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:04,370
we could be international
backup dancers on her world tour.

615
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:09,233
There he is now!

616
00:34:09,499 --> 00:34:10,970
Yes.

617
00:34:22,913 --> 00:34:25,014
You have to kiss her.

618
00:34:26,295 --> 00:34:27,887
Kiss her!

619
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:05,081
What are you doing?

620
00:35:06,783 --> 00:35:08,374
Uh... Snow White is alive!

621
00:35:10,796 --> 00:35:12,671
So Snow White lives.

622
00:35:12,706 --> 00:35:14,956
But are Dan and Olivia dead?

623
00:35:19,157 --> 00:35:20,191
Blair,

624
00:35:20,226 --> 00:35:22,926
it was amazing. You surprised us all.

625
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:25,533
Speaking of which, I have
a surprise for all of you.

626
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,472
And, uh, Dan, if you
ever think of applying

627
00:35:27,507 --> 00:35:30,750
to the playwriting program, let me know if you
want me to read your sample, give some notes.

628
00:35:30,785 --> 00:35:34,585
Oh, wow. Oh, thank you so much. Yeah,
I'm gonna take you up on that offer.

629
00:35:39,441 --> 00:35:40,673
Everyone,

630
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:41,708
follow me.

631
00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:47,897
So maureen,

632
00:35:48,805 --> 00:35:50,194
uh... wow.

633
00:35:50,908 --> 00:35:53,249
- I, um, I can't believe she did that.
- I called her.

634
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:54,434
She admitted it.

635
00:35:55,712 --> 00:35:56,715
You okay?

636
00:35:57,792 --> 00:35:59,292
Not really.

637
00:35:59,545 --> 00:36:02,245
My wife isn't who I thought she was,

638
00:36:03,254 --> 00:36:05,154
and neither's my marriage.

639
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,891
Nate, thanks for hearing me out earlier.

640
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:12,519
You're a great friend.

641
00:36:12,782 --> 00:36:13,832
Yeah, well...

642
00:36:15,225 --> 00:36:16,525
any time.

643
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:20,375
Wait. Nate, you knew? Why
didn't you say anything to me?

644
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,260
- I...
- Look, Serena,

645
00:36:23,034 --> 00:36:24,634
I don't know anything anymore.

646
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:28,056
I just know I don't want to be alone.

647
00:36:28,091 --> 00:36:29,841
Could we take a walk?

648
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:31,838
Yeah.

649
00:36:32,571 --> 00:36:33,721
Hey, wait.

650
00:36:34,547 --> 00:36:35,547
Serena,

651
00:36:36,873 --> 00:36:40,423
I didn't tell you about Maureen
because Tripp's a married man.

652
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:43,108
If you go with him now,
you're gonna cross the line.

653
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,325
Thank you for everything, Nate, really,

654
00:36:48,146 --> 00:36:51,176
but that line just got a little blurry.

655
00:37:03,657 --> 00:37:05,497
I don't get it. What is all this?

656
00:37:05,532 --> 00:37:09,115
You may never have heard of Cyrus Rose
before, but Lady Gaga certainly has.

657
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,598
Back when she was still at Tisch,
they used to play cards together.

658
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:13,453
Who do you think "Poker Face" is about?

659
00:37:13,488 --> 00:37:17,088
That's why she's letting
us see her dress rehearsal.

660
00:37:57,473 --> 00:37:59,029
Hey, Olivia. Wh... where have you been?

661
00:37:59,064 --> 00:38:01,375
You kind of abandoned me out there.

662
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,410
I know.

663
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,214
Sorry.

664
00:38:04,947 --> 00:38:07,544
I knew Vanessa would step in,

665
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:09,379
And I needed you to kiss her.

666
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:11,552
Yeah, which I did,

667
00:38:11,587 --> 00:38:15,527
because I had to for the play. I mean,
you... you made me do it. You can't be mad.

668
00:38:15,562 --> 00:38:17,391
You can't judge what
happened if you didn't see it.

669
00:38:17,426 --> 00:38:19,476
I didn't need to.

670
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:21,918
You were the one that
needed to kiss her again,

671
00:38:21,953 --> 00:38:25,703
to realize for yourself that
your feelings for her are real.

672
00:38:30,714 --> 00:38:31,714
Anyway, uh,

673
00:38:32,107 --> 00:38:34,015
I just got off the phone with K.C.,

674
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,219
and she kinda convinced me
to take that witch movie.

675
00:38:36,254 --> 00:38:38,701
What? Olivia, you
can't... you can't leave

676
00:38:38,736 --> 00:38:39,736
like this.

677
00:38:40,146 --> 00:38:41,646
I read the script.

678
00:38:41,823 --> 00:38:43,797
It's actually pretty good.

679
00:38:43,832 --> 00:38:45,332
I'll be back in the fall.

680
00:38:48,088 --> 00:38:49,788
There you are. Look...

681
00:38:50,067 --> 00:38:52,013
we're gonna have to talk about it.

682
00:38:52,048 --> 00:38:55,034
We saw each other naked,
and there's no going back.

683
00:38:55,069 --> 00:38:56,319
But we're friends.

684
00:38:56,686 --> 00:39:00,355
So, Olivia, I apologize for
how I acted during rehearsal.

685
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:04,786
But I don't like Dan like that,
and I haven't in years. rs.

686
00:39:04,821 --> 00:39:05,821
Right?

687
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,540
Yeah. Yeah, she's right.

688
00:39:09,798 --> 00:39:11,774
- And, you know,
- Hey, Vanessa.

689
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:13,609
I think Paul Hoffman kinda likes me.

690
00:39:38,165 --> 00:39:40,243
Look, I get the whole "Sullen
teenager pushing an envelope" thing.

691
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:42,964
I've pushed a pack.

692
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:45,399
But you're better than that Damien guy.

693
00:39:45,981 --> 00:39:47,555
Look, I may be queen,

694
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:51,040
but I'm more lonely and bored than
I was when I lived in Brooklyn.

695
00:39:51,203 --> 00:39:54,203
- And being with him is exciting.
- And dangerous.

696
00:39:55,067 --> 00:39:58,140
Please. It takes one to know one.

697
00:39:58,175 --> 00:40:01,163
I saw that look in your eye the
very first day you came on my radar.

698
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:03,392
And what so-called look would that be?

699
00:40:03,427 --> 00:40:05,827
Be very careful, Jennifer Humphrey.

700
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:08,480
If you go down the rabbit hole, it's
going to take moreit's going to take more

701
00:40:08,515 --> 00:40:10,777
than Blair Waldorf and
your army of minions

702
00:40:10,812 --> 00:40:13,962
to drag you back out.

703
00:40:15,134 --> 00:40:17,744
So what, you're gonna walk me to my room

704
00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:19,502
and make sure I don't
get into any trouble?

705
00:40:19,537 --> 00:40:23,589
Just try not to run into any
euro dealers in the kitchen.

706
00:40:48,391 --> 00:40:49,391
Are you okay?

707
00:40:56,928 --> 00:41:01,503
Sometimes it's after the curtains
close that the real reckonings come.

708
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,740
Whether it's about
who we wish we were...

709
00:41:19,148 --> 00:41:21,748
or who we wish we could be...

710
00:41:30,399 --> 00:41:32,199
or who we want.
