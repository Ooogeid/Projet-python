00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,570
Gossip girl here

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,130
Your one and only source

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,370
Into the scandalous lives of

4
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,300
Manhattan's elite. It feels so right to be together

5
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,800
But you're having second thoughts. I just think that we should... Think

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,540
Before we get back together.

7
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,640
My name is actually Marcus Beaton.

8
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,920
I'm british and a lord.

9
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:17,910
Please don't leave with him.

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,060
Three words. Say it, and I'm yours.

11
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,330
I... That's all I needed to hear.

12
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,710
Eleanor's been in paris, like, the entire time.

13
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,780
What if it was a waste? They want to take our money?

14
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,700
Not yet, but they have frozen our accounts. Everything okay?

15
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,560
No, actually, it's not, but I'm so glad I called you.

16
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,850
I really missed you this summer. Blair's dating Catherine's stepson,

17
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,590
And, Catherine, Nate's Blair's ex.

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,900
You can take care of this... With my help

19
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,920
And what would I have to do for you? Oh, my effing god!

20
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,390
I'm so sorry, but I'm not gonna be able to make it back tonight.

21
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,460
It's okay. I was tired anyway, so we'll hang out another time.

22
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,700
What do you say we just forget thinking

23
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,430
And follow our hearts?

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,410
In spite of my lowly, unroyal ways,

25
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,470
Accept that I have true feelings for Marcus

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,090
And that he has them for me, too.

27
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,460
And who am i?

28
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,860
That's a secret I'll never tell.

29
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,480
You know you love me.

30
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,170
X.O.X.O., gossip girl.

31
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,360
In these last hazy days of summer,

32
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,380
A few simple tips to beat the heat.

33
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,210
One--drink plenty of fluids.

34
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,090
Two--stay out of the sun.

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,670
Oh, excuse me. Sorry.

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,490
Excuse me. Ow.

37
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,040
Three... Ugh!

38
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,140
Limit all physical activity.

39
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,910
That is, within reason.

40
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,700
I thought you wanted my help with this party you're hosting.

41
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,370
A back-to-school party for seniors and their parents?

42
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,790
It can wait.

43
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,940
But someone could walk in. Dorota or--

44
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,320
So? Didn't you see "atonement"?

45
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,880
That scene in the library when they're discovered?

46
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,540
Mm. No. No, Blair.

47
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,430
That's not you.

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,930
It's not?

49
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,880
You're a delicate little flower,

50
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,090
Nothing like that tart, keira knightley.

51
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,340
It's just, we've been dating a while, and I thought--

52
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,320
I feel the same way, but you're very special to me.

53
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,910
I want the moment to equal it.

54
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,490
Now...

55
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,560
The tea's getting cold.

56
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,070
And if the heat's still too much,

57
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,160
There's always a cold shower.

58
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,720
Ugh! Jenny? Are you okay?

59
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,670
Yeah. Sorry. My phone slipped. I think my cheek got sweaty.

60
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,460
What was I saying? Oh, right, right.

61
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,340
You like him. He likes you. So just call him. He stood me up, remember?

62
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,690
He just made you wait a really long time

63
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,330
And then called to cancel. That's completely different.

64
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,150
And besides, he only did that to spare you his family drama,

65
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,910
Which is just more proof that he likes

66
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,410
You. And calling him won't look desperate

67
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,640
It might. It will. It will,

68
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,380
But in a cute, romantic way. What is wrong with me

69
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,760
I am so not the whiny,

70
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,610
"should I call him?" girl. Exactly. You are Vanessa

71
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,680
The "do whatever she wants" girl,

72
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,460
And you want to call him, so just do it.

73
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,290
Look, I gotta go. Laurel is gonna kill me, okay? Bye.

74
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,590
Hey, can s--can you guys pick that up, please?

75
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,450
Please?!

76
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,370
Ralph lauren adores you.

77
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,020
Catherine, did you hear what I just said?

78
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,720
I did. What happened to the money I gave you?

79
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,400
It's gone, but I can repay you back

80
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,240
As soon as our accounts are unfrozen.

81
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,670
Which won't be until your father gets back from

82
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,710
Where was it again? Dominica? I told you that in confidence.

83
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,250
You told me that in bed.

84
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,890
Relax, gorgeous. We can discuss this tomorrow over lunch.

85
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,680
I got us a room at the mercer. We can order in.

86
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,430
I'm so glad this didn't end.

87
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,320
Me, too.

88
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,480
Try these on. I'm gonna go find you some ties.

89
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,940
Hey, Vanessa.

90
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,790
Nate, hi. I hope it's okay that I'm calling.

91
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. Uh, how are you? Good.

92
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,950
Um, so listen. I was wondering if--

93
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,060
Hey, do you want to do something later

94
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,620
Yeah. Sure. That sounds great.

95
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,660
Cool. Okay. Hey, listen. I'll call you later, okay?

96
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,730
Okay. Bye.

97
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,330
Who was that?

98
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,540
It's my mom. It's about the party tomorrow night.

99
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,390
I'm gonna try these on.

100
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,230
A coming-out party? Well, sooner or later,

101
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,040
People are gonna figure out we're dating.

102
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,060
We're not exactly the world's most covert secret couple.

103
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,190
Yeah, my family's getting a little curious

104
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,650
About my new friend "clyde" that keeps calling and calling.

105
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,210
See? Come on. We tell everybody once, and then it's done.

106
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,050
And now--thank you, universe-- we have the perfect opportunity.

107
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,110
Yeah, a party hosted by Blair Waldorf,

108
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,080
The biggest Dan Humphrey supporter in all of manhattan.

109
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,480
What are you afraid of? Right now? Heatstroke.

110
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,980
Dan. No. Hey. No, no, no. I-i know. I know.

111
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,700
Look, right now things are just--

112
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,640
They're so good between us.

113
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,230
You know, and if we just start telling people... What?

114
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,030
What could anybody possibly say that would change this?

115
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,350
You're right.

116
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,090
I'm in.

117
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,710
Everything's gonna be fine.

118
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,530
Let's hope so, s., because it looks like

119
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,090
Your coming-out party just moved up.

120
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,690
Rachel, I'll give you a call when I'm feeling better.

121
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,920
Spotted--s. And lonely boy

122
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,280
Locking lips like all is forgiven.

123
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,120
Will round two be any different?

124
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,550
Ugh! I knew it.

125
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,670
Dan! Aah!

126
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,460
Yay! Oh, sweaty hug. You're sweaty. Thanks.

127
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,510
Oh! You guys are together. You're back together, right?

128
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,830
It wasn't a doctored photo? No, no, no.

129
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,380
We are. We just hadn't told anyone yet

130
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,430
Oh, this is awesome! You guys totally belong together.

131
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,560
This is Laurel. Hold on. Hello? I ran into Jenny out on the street.

132
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,690
So the word's out, huh? Apparently.

133
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,630
I'm happy for you. And you two have worked out all your issues?

134
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,190
Um... Yeah.

135
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,790
Yep. Got 'em all squared away.

136
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,080
That's great.

137
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,720
How is it that you're not hot?

138
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,320
Well, it is the upper east side.

139
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,460
I mean, getting hot is kinda frowned upon.

140
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,810
So when am I gonna get to see you again?

141
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,850
Depends. Can I count on you not to cancel at

142
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,690
The last second? That will never, ever happen again

143
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,730
It's okay. No, no, no. I'm serious.

144
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,930
Like, I mean, everything with my family's been so crazy.

145
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,000
But when you called today, it just felt like...

146
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,060
Like I could breathe again. So... I wanna do this.

147
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,410
I want to make this-- us--right, okay?

148
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,890
Okay. Tomorrow night?

149
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,500
Uh, tomorrow night I gotta take my mom

150
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,680
To this, like, school party. Fine.

151
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,480
Come to the gallery. You can bring me lunch

152
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,520
Oh. Well. I...

153
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,140
Well, it was a good speech.

154
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,080
No, no, no, no. I'm serious.

155
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,010
I mean, I have family stuff, but i-i'll reschedule,

156
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,770
And they'll just have to deal with it.

157
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,770
Rumor is, Nate Archibald has a hidden lady.

158
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,380
Careful, n.

159
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,890
Secrets don't keep long in this heat.

160
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,720
So... The flowers won't arrive until 5:00.

161
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,660
Did you get the order from the caterers?

162
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,590
Eleanor comes home today.

163
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,420
You excited she finally gets to meet Marcus?

164
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,290
And see why he's so wonderful?

165
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,600
It's not often you find a man

166
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,780
Who's intelligent, sophisticated,

167
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,720
Has an appreciation for golden-age hollywood

168
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,450
And is a gentleman to boot.

169
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,470
You know, he hasn't pressured me about sex once.

170
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,090
Not once.

171
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,650
Wow. Sounds like you really like him.

172
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,930
Yes, I do.

173
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,380
Do you see what I just did there?

174
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,690
I expressed an interest in your relationship.

175
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,760
Look, I know you know about me and Dan.

176
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,520
Even Dorota told me she was happy for me. I'm happy for you.

177
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,550
B., I know you don't approve of him. True.

178
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,550
And I know that he's not

179
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,250
The 22nd lord of westmorelandshire.

180
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,790
Also true.

181
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,280
Why can't you support me?

182
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:28,030
Have you two talked about everything,

183
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,820
All the very real reasons you broke up last year?

184
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,870
Well, not completely.

185
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,290
Well, when you do,

186
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,560
If you're still together, I'll be happy for you.

187
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,940
Till then, I think you're just fooling yourselves.

188
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,170
Duchess, to what do I owe this pleasure?

189
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,420
Okay, I think you've got this taken care of.

190
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,260
I'll see you tonight.

191
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,390
Sneaky little Nate.

192
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,670
Yes, I know exactly the girl you're talking about.

193
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,410
Her name is Vanessa. She lives in... Brooklyn.

194
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,420
Smoke?

195
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,410
No, thanks. It's, uh, a little early for me.

196
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,400
So how can I help, NathaNiel?

197
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,010
About last week-- um, the money?

198
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,250
I, uh, I might have overreacted a little. A little?

199
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,830
Yeah, and, hey, if you can,

200
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,090
I would love to take you up on the offer as a loan.

201
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,400
I thought you were getting the money from somewhere else.

202
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,560
Yeah, well, that person, um, is asking for a lot.

203
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,640
Well...

204
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,650
I'd love to accommodate you, but when you spurned my offer,

205
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,190
I sent the money to my financial guides.

206
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,350
It's tied up in bonds for six months.

207
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,330
Oh. Uh, no. That's cool.

208
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,290
I'll just-- I'll find another way.

209
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,890
So, uh, have you seen Blair and lord fauntleroy recently?

210
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,400
No.

211
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,040
Are you doing okay? Hmm, hmm.

212
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,020
I'll confess, I've been feeling a little off my game...

213
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,690
But I'm expecting a return to form very soon.

214
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,550
Sir, the flight from tokyo has landed.

215
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,970
So I can see.

216
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,660
Konnichiwa.

217
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,250
I know it's hot, but I need everything fitted

218
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,910
And ready for Eleanor to inspect. Jenny? Yeah, I know.

219
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,850
I'll clean the atelier as soon as I'm

220
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,210
Finished here, okay? The bathrooms, too

221
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,080
Someone decided to give us a second look at breakfast.

222
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,290
Laurel believes in her interns paying their dues.

223
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,830
You must really want this.

224
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,750
Why, 'cause for the past three months

225
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,110
I've put up with midnight coffee runs, 15-hour days,

226
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,310
Cleaning up after the two in-house bulimics,

227
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,370
All so that Eleanor Waldorf

228
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,870
Will spend five minutes looking at my designs?

229
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,770
Yeah. Yeah, I really, really do.

230
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,200
Okay.

231
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,230
Uh, I feel like it's not right.

232
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,740
Um, hold on.

233
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,770
Hello. C'est ?L'heure?Merci> madam.<

234
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,390
Air france says Eleanor's plane's on time. Oh.

235
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,330
All right, I'm gonna meet her at the penthouse

236
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,940
I think Blair's hosting a party there.

237
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,250
If the a.C. Guy comes, call me. Yes?

238
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,470
I think there might be something wrong with the dress.

239
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,280
No. This--this is what Eleanor designed.

240
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,400
Really? Even--

241
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,230
Did you ever see "cinderella"?

242
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,990
The cartoon? Sure.

243
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,440
Remember the little birds that helped her dress?

244
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,540
Remember how they didn't offer their opinion?

245
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,300
Try to imagine that you're one of those birds.

246
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,060
Can you do that? Yeah.

247
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,870
Now fly away.

248
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,520
She can be so infuriating.

249
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,540
Sometimes I just want to...

250
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,170
Okay, enough Blair bashing.

251
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,700
No. Don't stop on my account, please.

252
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,680
Keep on bashing. I mean, obviously we have things to talk about,

253
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,230
And we'll talk about them, but it's no big deal, right?

254
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,350
Oh, god. You--you agree with her.

255
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,830
No, no. I don't. No, I don't. It's--it's just, uh...

256
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,490
Wait. H-hold on.

257
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,170
Oh, it's my mom. She's calling from shanghai.

258
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,690
Can I take this? Oh, yeah. Go.

259
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,760
Sorry. Hello? Saved by the bell.

260
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:10,150
Are you Dan Humphrey? Hi, mom. Oh, my gosh. Where?

261
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,950
Uh, yeah. Can I help you?

262
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,360
How could you do it?

263
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,750
What? I'm sorry. I-i don't-- get back together with Serena.

264
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,210
Don't you know she's just gonna lie to you again? She doesn't respect you.

265
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,190
She never will. Excuse me. Who--who are you?

266
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,310
We read about everything on "gossip girl."

267
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,870
Your whole breakup? We're on your side.

268
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,150
Except for her. She's a Serena.

269
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,950
Okay, um, well, look, this is--

270
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,480
This is both creepy and none of your business.

271
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,160
So if you could, uh, just go, please.

272
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,420
You can just run along. I-i lost her

273
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,980
They were on a yacht with some greek prince.

274
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,780
Hello. Yeah, ignore them.

275
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,040
Serena, how could you forgive him

276
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,460
After sleeping with Georgina? What?

277
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,340
What? No. No, this is insane. I didn't sleep with Georgina. No.

278
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,510
All right? Please go. But we're on your side.

279
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,050
Not me. His mouth kissed Georgina's.

280
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,070
Think about that the next time-- o-okay. Yeah.

281
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,080
Th-that's enough. Now I'm telling you to go

282
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,670
Come on. Get out of here. Shoo. Thank you.

283
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,290
Wow. What was that?

284
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,890
That was, uh, oh, that was "gossip girl."

285
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,260
So?

286
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,300
Well, maybe there are some things that, um,

287
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,960
You know, we--we should talk about.

288
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,830
Yeah. Well, I think so.

289
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,280
Y-yeah, th-there's some stuff I have to do

290
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,040
Now, before the party. Okay.

291
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,790
So why don't we talk, um... Yeah, we'll talk later when I pick you up.

292
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,760
Yeah, perfect. Okay. All right, that'll be good.

293
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:34,930
Bye. Bye. I'll see you later.

294
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,470
Nate. Hello?

295
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,690
Hmm? Look, I'm sorry.

296
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,140
There's just a lot going on.

297
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,100
Maybe you just need to be properly distracted.

298
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,890
I'm sorry. No, no, no. It's me.

299
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,380
No, Nate. You don't need to explain anything.

300
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,220
It's fine. Really. I--

301
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,120
What an unusual little space--

302
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,910
Half gallery, half boho coffee shop.

303
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,140
But then unusual pairings seem to be the

304
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,860
Order of the day. Blair, what are you doing here

305
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,150
Being angry at you, for one. Here I thought I'd surprise you

306
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,460
By bringing Vanessa to tonight's party when lo and behold,

307
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,670
You two have rekindled your love in secret.

308
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,490
You came all the way to brooklyn to invite me to a part

309
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,900
For a school that I don't even go to?

310
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,870
It was for Nate, dear. Anne called this morning

311
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,380
Poor thing has a migraine.

312
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,210
When I thought of you coming all alone,

313
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,040
I just wanted to do something nice.

314
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,640
Is that so hard to believe? Yeah.

315
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,350
Yeah. Pretty much.

316
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,910
Hello? I got a delivery. Excuse me.

317
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,340
Blair, what are you really doing here?

318
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,160
You can't stand Vanessa, and you've never done anything

319
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,280
When something wasn't in it for you.

320
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,140
You think I'm just gonna sit back and watch you hav

321
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,590
An affair with my boyfriend's mother? Guess again.

322
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,190
So what are your plans, to distract me with Vanessa

323
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,040
Yes. What about it? It's just as your plans go, it's kinda nice.

324
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,820
"a," don't be offensive,

325
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,160
And "b," from what I just witnessed,

326
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,040
If you want to keep her, you're gonna have to step it up.

327
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,010
So I can look forward to seeing you tonight?

328
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,620
Sure. We'll be there. Really?

329
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,600
Yeah. Why not?

330
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,590
Wonderful. Till tonight.

331
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,590
Duchess, it's me.

332
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,310
He's bringing her.

333
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,800
And for the record, whatever you're planning with Nate,

334
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,850
My bedroom floor is off-limits.

335
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,340
Who was that?

336
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,710
A whiff of the far east.

337
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,870
Sometimes I envy you,

338
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,600
The way you just--

339
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,170
Ew. What am I saying? You're disgusting.

340
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,950
Relax. Nothing happened with madame butterfly.

341
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,860
Yeah, right.

342
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,230
No. Nothing happened.

343
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,010
Same as nothing's been happening all week.

344
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,110
What are you talking about?

345
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,210
You've had different girls every day.

346
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,280
No. I'll take your incredulity as a compliment.

347
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,330
No, but, I mean, come on. You--you must have tried--

348
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,760
Everything...

349
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,420
From the erotic to the pharmaceutical.

350
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,000
I-i'm sorry. I'm not laughing. It's just so obvious.

351
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,010
You're not over Blair.

352
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,540
Wh--come on. This is your body's way of telling you.

353
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,300
I don't have a romantic bone in my body,

354
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,340
Least of all that one.

355
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,620
But you do raise an interesting idea.

356
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,810
Clearly there's some sort of... Blockage.

357
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:35,870
Perhaps...

358
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,640
No, Chuck.

359
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:40,180
One more go-around, just to clear the pipes.

360
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,510
You are not using Blair as sexual drano.

361
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,490
I have to make myself presentable.

362
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,370
I have a party to attend.

363
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,410
By the way...

364
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,440
Congrats on you and Humphrey.

365
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,490
Water always finds its own level.

366
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,370
I just think if we hemmed it

367
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,250
And then got rid of all that stuff by the collar, right?

368
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,500
Yeah. Oh, my god. That's so much better.

369
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,700
I just--i feel like the dress is trying too hard,

370
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,040
And this part is so '90s.

371
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,710
Interesting observation. And who are you?

372
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,460
Uh, I'm...

373
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,590
I'm Jenny Humphrey, the parsons intern.

374
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,970
Uh, I thought you were going home.

375
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,400
Laurel went to go meet you.

376
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:24,110
And I decided to come here. You can, um, leave those

377
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,010
And bring the rest of the bags to the apartment.

378
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:31,270
So now interns have opinions.

379
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,720
I have been gone a while.

380
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,770
Mrs. Waldorf, um, I hope that you don't think

381
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,860
That I was trying-- that you were

382
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,330
Telling the model that has to wear my desig

383
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,310
All the many, many things that are wrong with it?

384
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,050
It's hot and late.

385
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,220
We'll finish your fitting tomorrow.

386
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,230
I'm--i'm so sorry.

387
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,410
That was completely, completely unprofessional,

388
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,690
And I promise it will never happen again from me.

389
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,010
I s--i swear.

390
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,400
I know you won't.

391
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,110
Not here at least.

392
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,320
I need people around here that I can trust.

393
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,720
Clean out your station.

394
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,380
What? No.

395
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:11,910
No, please. You can't--

396
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,270
Oh, yes, please, I can,

397
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,580
And if you are still hoping for a letter of recommendation,

398
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,870
You won't argue.

399
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,660
Why is it so hot in here?

400
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,800
Nate!

401
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,290
Oh, hey! I thought that was you. A little warm for a run, isn't it?

402
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,800
Yeah, you know, I was just, um, had some things to think about.

403
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,460
Will I see you at Blair's tonight?

404
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,550
Yeah. Uh, you headed down there now or what?

405
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,900
No, no. I promised the duchess I'd pick her up. Oh, your mother's coming.

406
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,820
Oh, yes. Oh, she and Blair are fast friends.

407
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,240
I always find them whispering in a corner.

408
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,080
It's a bit troubling, come to think of it.

409
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,980
Anyway, uh, I'll see you tonight. Thanks, man.

410
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,630
This is Vanessa. Leave a message after the beep.

411
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,930
Hey, Vanessa. It's Nate.

412
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,120
Uh, listen, I'm so sorry, but about tonight--

413
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,610
It's just, um...

414
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,280
Hey.

415
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,310
I thought you and Dan were leaving for the party. Yeah. We're supposed to.

416
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,860
He's not still reading one of those Dan-and-serena-

417
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,390
Should-they-or-shouldn't-they threads, is he? Last I checked, yeah.

418
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,150
Something's wrong? I just got a message from Nate. Family drama,

419
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,300
Doesn't want to burden me-- the same old story.

420
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,960
I just want to shake him, like,

421
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,540
I can handle it, you know? Hey. Sorry. I'm, uh, I'm ready

422
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,460
So how was public opinion on the Dan and Serena front? Oh, well,

423
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,560
It turns out most people think I'm an ass.

424
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,950
But a passionate minority hold I'm just an idiot.

425
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,000
So are you ready? Uh, Nate's running late. I'll just--i'll meet you there.

426
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,470
Okay. You sure? Yeah.

427
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,320
Uh, you still positive you don't want me tagging along?

428
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,270
Yeah. No offense, dad, but I think you, me and Serena--

429
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,800
Things are awkward enough. Well,

430
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,260
It's not like I'd have to be a third wheel

431
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,610
I can bring a date.

432
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,790
What? No, it's--it's not that you having a date is funny

433
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,610
Or--or completely outside of the realm of possibility,

434
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,300
Ju-just within the gates.

435
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,590
One day I might surprise you. Go.

436
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,860
See you there.

437
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,480
You know, if you really like this guy, you should call him,

438
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,510
Tell him how you feel.

439
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,490
The mature response. Tempting.

440
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,390
Or if you're looking for something immature,

441
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,860
You could tell him you left the phone in the gallery

442
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:34,690
And never got the message.

443
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,420
I've seen you be very forgetful.

444
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,650
Duchess, here. Sorry to leave you on your own.

445
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,330
Oh, thank you, darling. My pleasure.

446
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,130
Well, the ancestral home is next to Balmoral.

447
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,030
Marcus tells the funniest story

448
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,720
About Harry running naked across their lawn.

449
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,360
Prince Harry? I love him.

450
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,070
But you've been planning on yale

451
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,570
Ever since you were a little girl. I know,

452
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,710
But Marcus keeps begging me to consider oxford

453
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,370
What a pity. So much wasted potential.

454
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,350
What are you talking about?

455
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,790
The thing that always fascinated me about you.

456
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,120
The cool exterior, the fire below.

457
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,010
You are living proof a person can't buy class.

458
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,300
And you can't tell me

459
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,580
Bertie wooster is satisfying your needs.

460
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,030
Titles aside, a suit of armor makes for a cold bedfellow.

461
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,590
Not that it's any of your business,

462
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,520
But Marcus and I have an amazing sex life.

463
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,840
Is that so? Mm.

464
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:38,890
What names does he call you when you make love?

465
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,440
Where does he put his hand?

466
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,550
Does he...

467
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,620
Have sex with me.

468
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,320
What?

469
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,130
Just once. That's all I need.

470
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,710
You are disgusting, and I hate you.

471
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,670
Then why are you still holding my hand?

472
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,940
I have a party to host.

473
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,080
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

474
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,970
Oh, no. It's not a problem. You--you look great, as always.

475
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,200
Thank you.

476
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,230
Oh. Oh, that's, uh, that's troubling.

477
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,420
Maybe we should just go. Yeah.

478
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,290
Did I say you look nice?

479
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,810
Yeah. Thanks again, though.

480
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,100
Yeah. You're welcome.

481
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,940
Did you do anything this afternoon?

482
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,270
No. No. You?

483
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,760
No.

484
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,250
Chuck had a japanese stewardess over today.

485
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,760
It's a slow elevator.

486
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,310
Where's Vanessa?

487
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,140
Not walking into your trap or whatever it is.

488
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,390
Oh, please. You want me to feel bad?

489
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,060
You're not exactly occupying

490
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,320
The moral high ground, Archibald. I just hope it's worth it.

491
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,470
Nathaniel, you came. I'm so happy.

492
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:37,340
Seems like forever since I've seen you or heard from you.

493
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,390
So you use my friends for some power play

494
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,090
To prove you're the one in control, huh? I don't like sharing my toys,

495
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,390
Especially if I've paid for them.

496
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,260
Where's your friend? I was looking forward

497
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,350
To meeting her. No, no. Stop it. Look at me

498
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,780
I don't know where I'm gonna get the money

499
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,560
From, but you listen-- okay, no, Nate, listen

500
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:51,540
No. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. It was out of jealousy.

501
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:55,900
Please just don't do something we'll both regret. No.

502
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,750
Nate?

503
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,750
Oh, my god.

504
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,010
Everyone, stay calm.

505
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,500
I'm sure the power will be back on in a second.

506
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,510
Vanessa.

507
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,820
Nate.

508
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,500
It'll be fine.

509
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,290
Sorry to break it to you, b.,

510
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,490
But this party just went over to the dark side.

511
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:37,690
It's a citywide blackout, but we have candles.

512
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,020
Everything's fine.

513
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,380
Vanessa. Nate, thank goodness.

514
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,600
Would you please tell this young lady

515
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,800
She can't go outside in the blackout? Yeah. Well, I am.

516
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,230
No, it's okay, Marcus. I got it. I got it.

517
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,760
Just come with me, please.

518
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,390
I can't believe this. Here I kept thinking,

519
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,780
"nate's so much different than Blair and all the others,"

520
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,780
But you're just as bad. Look, it's not that simple, okay?

521
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,900
Are you sleeping with that woman?

522
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,350
Yes.

523
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,760
Is that the reason you keep canceling on me?

524
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,850
Yes, but--

525
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,960
No, Nate. There are no "but"s. You lied to me,

526
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,720
And you're sleeping with some mrs. Robinson.

527
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,350
And while on the upper east side that might be totally normal...

528
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,450
I didn't sign up for some creepy love triangle

529
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,890
With you and someone's mom. She's giving me money.

530
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,810
Well, that's just the capper, isn't it?

531
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,960
No, my mom and I needed help.

532
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,760
I just-- I had no other option.

533
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,140
Tell me everything.

534
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,570
Now if everyone will just get a drink and a candle,

535
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,960
I'm sure the power will be back in a minute.

536
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,640
Blair, have you seen Nate?

537
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,590
Um, no. It's a blackout.

538
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,070
That girl showed up. They went off somewhere together.

539
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,150
Honestly, Catherine, so what?

540
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,370
If they want to be together, you can't stop them.

541
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,980
Just deal with it. I wouldn't expect you to understand.

542
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,790
Hot young guy, aging beauty enjoying her last hurrah

543
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,180
Before the surgeries start.

544
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,750
Tt's called a clich?

545
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,690
Is Marcus everything you could possibly hope for?

546
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,670
Yes, absolutely.

547
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,920
Really? There's not one thing that's missing?

548
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,190
That one thing you tell yourself you can live without?

549
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,910
That you'd happily sacrifice for the rest?

550
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,250
'cause I tell you what.

551
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,370
You're gonna sacrifice it every day for the rest of your life.

552
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,440
Nate makes me feel alive.

553
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,940
I'm not g gonna give that up.

554
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,760
Yeah, my name's Dan Humphrey.

555
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,160
Yeah. Uh, the elevator's stuck.

556
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,720
Okay.

557
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,910
Okay. All right. Thank you.

558
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:56,860
Well, it's a citywide blackout,

559
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,310
So the guy says we just have to wait,

560
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,510
Hope the power comes back on soon.

561
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,640
What?

562
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,920
No. No, I know when you're thinking of something.

563
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,780
Just tell me. No, it's--it's nothing.

564
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:14,850
Serena. Well, you--you probably should have mentioned my name.

565
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,680
Are you kidding? Just forget it.

566
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,330
No, seriously.

567
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,990
You think that there's, like, a box that says, "open in event

568
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,650
Of Serena Van Der Woodsen emergency"? I live in the building. That's all.

569
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,620
No, it's a citywide blackout, so there--there must be

570
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,290
Hundreds of people stuck in elevators right now. Okay,

571
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,940
If you're not gonna call them, can we not talk about it

572
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:32,700
You're making it hotter. Okay.

573
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,070
No, Dan-- why not?

574
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,410
Yeah, hey. It's Dan Humphrey again.

575
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,510
Uh, humph--humphrey, the guy in the elevator?

576
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,480
Yeah. I know, I know,

577
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:44,540
But I forgot to say that I'm with Serena Van Der Woodsen.

578
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,840
Okay. Thanks.

579
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,970
Well, they're gonna send someone, so...

580
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,850
Um, I guess I'm gonna go now.

581
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,560
Oh, please.

582
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,780
I am not sending you out into a blackout.

583
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,740
You can stay till the lights come back on.

584
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,760
Okay. Thanks.

585
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,530
As--as long as you're here, come here. Hold this.

586
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,890
I just--i cannot--

587
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,070
I cannot decide about this neckline.

588
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,720
Really? I think it's cute.

589
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,640
Why don't you try telling the truth?

590
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,590
It's not like I can fire you twice.

591
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,570
Well, it looks like a pilgrim at a funeral.

592
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,930
Uh, I'm sorry.

593
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,470
You're absolutely right.

594
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,000
I am?

595
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,230
Yeah. Don't let it go to your head.

596
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,260
But my mom still thinks Chuck's lending us the money,

597
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,130
So just sending it through me.

598
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,340
So borrowing money from your son's friend is fine,

599
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,130
But whoring him out to pay the club bill isn't.

600
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,490
Do you wanna be with this woman?

601
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,270
No, I want to be with you.

602
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,160
But I just know that's not gonna happen now, so...

603
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,390
Nate...

604
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,590
You have to end this for yourself.

605
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,880
Forget about what I said before.

606
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,370
You are better than this.

607
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,430
I'll be here when you get back.

608
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,940
I see.

609
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,710
Oh--oh, just a moment.

610
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,200
Blair, I'm on with the building manager.

611
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,320
I need you.

612
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:57,760
What? Has something happened? Everyone seems quite calm.

613
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:58,930
No.

614
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,250
I need you now.

615
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,530
Blair--blair, there's a blackout.

616
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,580
We have guests. We can't desert them.

617
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,120
I need you to make me feel alive.

618
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:11,370
Uh... Uh, wait, wait.

619
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,410
What are you-- what are you talking about?

620
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,550
Just meet me up in my bedroom, okay?

621
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,200
Looks like lady b. Is determined to have it all.

622
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,470
Question is, who with?

623
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,600
Nate?

624
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,950
Actually, I was looking for him myself.

625
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,450
Vanessa, is it?

626
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:50,250
Oh, I see. You're thinking, look at this awful woman

627
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,800
Who's taking advantage of an innocent young boy.

628
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,310
Nate told me everything.

629
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,350
I think what you're doing is disgusting.

630
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,020
And yet you're here, waiting for him,

631
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,710
Willing to forgive and forget.

632
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,080
You must really care for him.

633
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,960
You wouldn't understand.

634
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,180
See, that's where you're wrong.

635
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,060
You have no idea how I feel about Nate

636
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,060
And what I would do to keep him.

637
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,380
You want me to tell you?

638
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,450
Marcus, is that you?

639
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,000
Blow out your candle.

640
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,930
I spent the last month going around

641
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,140
And meeting with the--the stores

642
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,090
And the boutiques that carry my clothes.

643
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,090
That must have been so exciting. I felt like a fat cheerleader.

644
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:17,570
As a designer, your worst fear is becoming irrelevant.

645
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,890
Then I come back here

646
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:23,010
And find out the teenage intern tells me that exact thing.

647
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,500
I'm really sorry.

648
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,900
Maybe that is exactly what I needed to hear.

649
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,610
You know, the first real dress I ever bought was one of yours.

650
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,310
Just spare me the pity.

651
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,810
It's true.

652
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:44,340
I bought it from--well, from a consignment store... Ah.

653
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,280
'cause that was the only way I could afford it. Mm-hmm.

654
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,440
I was 12,

655
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:52,330
And I just wore it around the apartment for months.

656
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,900
It was one of the first things

657
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,580
That made me want to become a designer.

658
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,550
Jenny. Yeah?

659
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:00,760
The light.

660
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,660
Oh. Sorry. What do you want, Dan, for me to never say my name?

661
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,640
I'm not gonna get into this now.

662
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,250
We thought we could avoid dealing with last year

663
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,560
Well, this is fate telling us we can't.

664
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,510
What are you doing? I'm getting out of here.

665
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,790
No. Someone's coming. The man said so. Right. Because someone always comes

666
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,090
To save Serena Van Der Woodsen. That's not fair.

667
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,830
I know it's not. That's the point. Fine. You know what? Life's not fair,

668
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,410
Because it doesn't fit with the way you, Dan Humphrey,

669
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,580
Think things should be.

670
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:29,190
But why are you always right? No, I never--i never said..

671
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,460
Ooh! That hurt.

672
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,360
Are you okay?

673
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,610
Ow. Yeah. I'm fine.

674
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,080
Are you sure?

675
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,830
I'm sorry. Uh, ooh. Ow.

676
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,550
I forgive you for Georgina.

677
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:51,930
And I forgive you, but...

678
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,870
I don't know.

679
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,510
We keep having the same fight...

680
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,790
At bart's brunch a year ago,

681
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,730
At the wedding...

682
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:04,010
Where we talked about the fight at bart's brunch...

683
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,720
And now here.

684
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:12,530
I can't change who I am, Dan.

685
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,280
Me neither.

686
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,630
So what happens now?

687
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,740
I don't really feel like talking.

688
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,910
Yeah. Me neither.

689
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,310
Vanessa, I couldn't find her.

690
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,500
Vanessa?

691
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,930
Your friend had to leave.

692
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,600
Is there something that you wanted to tell me?

693
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:22,550
Blair.

694
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,100
Spotted--lady b. Acting not so ladylike.

695
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,190
Hope you kept the receipt for that tiara, b.

696
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,980
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

697
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,570
Blair, what is this? You don't understand. I thought it was you.

698
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:38,100
I--he had an accent. Please. You knew exactly who it was.

699
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,170
Marcus!

700
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,390
Marcus, wait.

701
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,910
Did you really not know it was him?

702
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,180
Can you honestly tell me that?

703
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,770
No, I knew it was him.

704
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,930
Thank you.

705
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,400
But I want you.

706
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,810
No, Blair.

707
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,100
You want my title, the idea of who I am.

708
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,500
But you clearly want him,

709
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,590
Which--which makes me a fool,

710
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,460
Because I actually did want you.

711
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,520
I do want you.

712
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:26,990
Then show me. I'm not some delicate little flower.

713
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,610
Show me you want me.

714
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:42,300
Vanessa. What--where are you-- where are you going?

715
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,580
I looked for you,

716
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,170
But I just--i had to get out.

717
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,300
Did you end it? No, not yet, but I was just g-

718
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,450
Okay, good. Don't. What, did Catherine say something to you?

719
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:55,110
She really loves you, Nate, and all the money and all that--

720
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,980
That's your business-- but she loves you,

721
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,630
And you should be with her. You want me to stay with her?

722
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,650
I am telling you that I am out for good.

723
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,430
No. Stop. Vanessa.

724
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,970
Tomorrow... You owe me lunch.

725
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,790
Jenny, what are you doing? The--well, the lights are back on.

726
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,400
Oh. I-i-i didn't even notice.

727
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,860
Jenny?

728
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,580
Dad? What are you doing here?

729
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,510
Making sure you're okay. I tried calling, but-

730
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,940
Oh, yeah. My phone died. Sorry.

731
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:39,190
Why are you wearing a jacket? It's, like, 100 degrees.

732
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,650
Well, I was on a...

733
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,480
On--on a date?

734
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:46,180
Yeah, I was gonna tell you guys. I've been dating.

735
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,360
Clare, Jenny. Jenny, clare.

736
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,270
Hi. I've been looking forward to meeting you...

737
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,100
Just not when I was all gross and sweaty.

738
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,080
I made her walk here from the village.

739
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,500
Well, it's nice to meet you, and I'm sorry.

740
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,050
Jenny, what's going on? Oh. It's my dad and his date.

741
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,710
Uh, they wanted to see if I was okay.

742
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,930
Yes. Oh. I probably should give Blair a call.

743
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,730
So you finished? You can come back with us. Um, yeah, I guess I'm done.

744
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,810
No. No, you aren't. You can't leave.

745
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,340
We haven't finished the dress yet.

746
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:16,320
Well, the lights are back on. I mean, aren't I fired? You got fired?

747
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,780
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

748
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:21,030
Maybe your father and his... Date

749
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,510
Could get us some sandwiches and some coffee.

750
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,290
We'll be working pretty late.

751
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,160
Do you guys mind? Please.

752
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,720
No. Sure.

753
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:33,070
So why'd you get fired? Jenny, come. Look.

754
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,190
Um, I'll tell you later. Thank you.

755
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,470
I'm scared.

756
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,890
I know. Me, too.

757
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,630
When I step out of here, it's over.

758
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,950
I-i think-- I think it was already.

759
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:09,030
It just took us this long to realize

760
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,440
And get used to the idea.

761
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,470
Serena...

762
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,390
I still--

763
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,790
I know.

764
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:32,910
Me, too.

765
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,450
I love you.

766
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,630
This isn't going to work.

767
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,120
I thought you said you were better.

768
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,310
I am...

769
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,380
Just not for you.

770
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,000
Oh, am I crazy or is it actually getting cooler?

771
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,650
About time.

772
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,160
You sure you're okay?

773
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,950
Yeah.

774
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,030
Yeah, it was the right thing.

775
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,580
You know, i, uh...

776
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,370
I-i'm--i'm sorry.

777
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,120
I cannot believe that Nate Archibald is a gigolo.

778
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:43,710
You cannot tell anyone, remember? Hey, who would I tell?

779
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,150
Who would I tell except everyone I've ever met? I won't. I won't.

780
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,580
But why'd you tell him to stay with that woman?

781
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:51,190
I thought you, you know, I thought you liked him.

782
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,270
I do.

783
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,730
That's-- that's why I did it.

784
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,340
I don't understand.

785
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:09,880
She told me that if Nate left her,

786
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,130
She would... Go to the f.B.I.

787
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,140
And tell them where Nate's dad is hiding out.

788
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,910
So...

789
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,530
I really didn't have a choice.

790
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,680
Love may fade with the season,

791
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,940
But some friendships are year-round,

792
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,930
Like you and me.

793
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,310
You know you love me.

794
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:58,280
X.O.X.O, gossip girl.
