Hey! It's the lovebirds.

4
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:10,415
- He told you, didn't he?
- Speaking for everyone, it's great.

5
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:13,830
Ever since I saw you, all I could think
about was payback for last year.

6
00:00:13,955 --> 00:00:15,222
Did you drug me?

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,975
She's ready to party.
Make sure you guys show her a good time.

8
00:00:18,848 --> 00:00:20,645
Nate, thank you so much for tonight.

9
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:22,220
Sorry. You need to leave.

10
00:00:22,345 --> 00:00:24,023
- What is going on?
- Isn't it obvious?

11
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,975
You've been played
from the beginning.

12
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:29,115
I didn't have the courage to tell you
that I signed the hotel over to Jack.

13
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,257
- And the hotel?
- Oh, lost.

14
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:34,370
I've come this far without my mother.
I'm not backing down now.

15
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,411
If it's a war Jack wants,
then it's a war he'll get.

Now I really hope
those are for my birthday.

25
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,516
Actually Chuck and Blair left them
after one of their games.

26
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,942
Happy birthday, though.

27
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:10,444
So when do I get

28
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:11,870
to unwrap my present?

29
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,781
What is that?

30
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:17,735
It's just a garter holster.

31
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,370
It's for my cell phone.

32
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,935
Well, then I'd better take you upstairs
so I can inspect it.

33
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:25,547
Except I have to go shopping with Blair
to pick out a dress for tonight.

34
00:01:25,672 --> 00:01:27,211
I don't know where we're going,

35
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,291
but you don't dress up
for a Knicks game.

36
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,549
But you do for the Frick benefit.

37
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,844
It's for Asian horned toads.
They're in danger.

38
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,565
That's your surprise...
a toad benefit?

39
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,635
It's not what you would do on
your birthday, but Chuck bought a table,

40
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,295
and we can celebrate this weekend.

41
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,365
And you're going to lunch
with your grandfather. That's festive.

42
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,792
Yeah, I'm gonna hit the shower.
So you have fun shopping.

43
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,932
- See you at 3:00?
- Yep.

44
00:01:53,057 --> 00:01:55,459
- Hello, Mr. Nate.
- Hey.

45
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,142
I feel very bad
not wishing him happy birthday

46
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:02,705
or bringing him
Polish breakfast sausage in bed.

47
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,169
Dorota, Nate has
to think everyone's blowing off

48
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:07,168
his birthday
so he'll be surprised tonight.

49
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:10,045
And he likes this game
where you kill people?

50
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,983
It's called "Assassin",
and he loves it.

51
00:02:13,954 --> 00:02:15,224
Did you get his phone?

52
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:22,600
In case anyone posts about the party.
I don't want him checking "Gossip Girl."

53
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,228
Can you hide this?

54
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:27,605
Thank you.

55
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,025
You really have surrounded yourself
with beautiful things,

56
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,630
so easy to auction off.
Gotta love Ebay.

57
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,715
As much as I hate
to interrupt your fun,

58
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,326
this has gone on long enough.

59
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,556
I want my hotel back.
Name your price.

60
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,416
I don't need your money, Chuck.

61
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,295
Then what is all this for...

62
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,403
just to hurt me?

63
00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:08,062
Just to hurt you?
Hurting you is a noble goal.

64
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,536
Granted, you know,
it wasn't all that difficult.

65
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,067
You've changed.

66
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,265
If you're referring to the fact
I'm not in Thailand

67
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,572
smoking hash with prostitutes,
change is good.

68
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,924
Young Chuck

69
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:21,554
in love.

70
00:03:21,841 --> 00:03:22,911
Beautiful...

71
00:03:23,309 --> 00:03:24,221
and sad.

72
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,081
Bart said you were soft.

73
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:30,084
My father left me the company
instead of you. I get it.

74
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:33,248
I'm more than happy letting Lily
guide my stock towards a tidy profit.

75
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,673
I know the Empire
is not your endgame.

76
00:03:36,193 --> 00:03:38,185
And if it's wounding me,
you've done it.

77
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,718
So why are you still here?

78
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,657
It's an interesting feeling

79
00:03:43,782 --> 00:03:46,183
holding another man's
prized possession.

80
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,605
You wonder
how far he'll go to get it back,

81
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,619
if there's anything he wouldn't do.

82
00:03:52,652 --> 00:03:53,774
I will do anything.

83
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,613
Well, there is something
that caught my eye.

84
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:00,489
I have to unfriend Ryuichi.

85
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,185
I thought the boy you met in Japan
was named Hideo.

86
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,589
- I met them both. Hideo was...
- More than a friend.

87
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,555
Thank you.
Point is, Hideo and his friends

88
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,749
have a fondness
for bathhouses and group photos.

89
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:14,173
- Oh, my god. Unfriend him immediately.
- <i>Sayonara, Ryuichi-san.</i>

90
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,131
- I didn't need to see that.
- Hideo was my rebound from Jonathan.

91
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,165
Now I need a rebound from Hideo.

92
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,115
There are boys
who'd go out with you.

93
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,364
Rufus, Jonathan and I are the only ones
at St. Jude's who are even out.

94
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,056
I'll work like Jenny.

95
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,850
I like working for Eleanor.

96
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,297
I don't need a guy to feel fulfilled
especially when he's unavailable.

97
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,929
- Poor Nate.
- What?

98
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,442
The e-mail from Serena

99
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,026
- reminding to blow off his birthday.
- That seems mean.

100
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,265
It's an act. She's planning
this whole surprise thing

101
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,360
She's spending
the afternoon getting it ready.

102
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,653
I don't get it then.

103
00:04:42,778 --> 00:04:45,325
What is Nate supposed to do,
think everyone forgot his birthday?

104
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,409
He spends five hours thinking
Serena is a terrible girlfriend.

105
00:04:48,534 --> 00:04:50,609
- He'll forgive her.
- Five hours.

106
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:55,173
I have to go to the fabric store.

107
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:57,880
All right.

108
00:05:01,032 --> 00:05:03,594
Denjuro,
you are definitely not my friend.

109
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,147
Hey. Good morning.

110
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,055
Huh? Oh, yeah. Hey.

111
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:15,189
Have you been up all night?

112
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:18,395
'Cause it looks like
you've killed an entire forest,

113
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,415
and your breath smells like
something dead.

114
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,429
Thanks.

115
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,070
The application
for the Tisch writing program

116
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:27,034
is due in two days,

117
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:29,435
I need to bear down
and finish my 1-act.

118
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,465
Is this the same 1-act
that you were 95% done with last week,

119
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,528
but didn't want to show me
until it was 100%?

120
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,087
Yeah, yeah, but there's no point
in showing it to you

121
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,714
until I've taken it
as far as I can myself.

122
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,756
This is why we showed each other
our work as soon as possible, remember?

123
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:45,415
Yeah, I do, but that was...

124
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,455
Before we started sleeping together.
I know.

125
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,455
But we said we'd date
and still be friends,

126
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,057
and this is being friends.

127
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,605
In fact...

128
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,752
What's it?

129
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:57,551
This is my script for my film class
that Iwas nervous about showing you.

130
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,512
This is the one based
on my short story.

131
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:01,325
Now hand yours over.

132
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,670
All right.

133
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,950
You gotta be completely honest here.

134
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,327
And I gotta... you should ignore
this first part.

135
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,355
In fact,
why don't we exchange tomorrow?

136
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,748
I gotta help Serena out
with Nate's birthday party,

137
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,875
and I'llgive yours
proper consideration,

138
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,498
maybe fine-tune this one more,
which it needs.

139
00:06:19,623 --> 00:06:22,405
Nice try, but you can read mine
on the subway after you shower.

140
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,590
Have a good day.

141
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,515
I tried texting you.

142
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,985
I can't seem to find my cell phone.

143
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:36,265
What are you doing here?

144
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:40,075
- It's your birthday. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

145
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,696
Here, I got you this.

146
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,785
You know, I'd say, like,
let me take you out to lunch

147
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,449
or something, but I'm sure
you and Serena already have plans.

148
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:50,993
No, actually. Actually, we don't.

149
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,365
I was gonna go to lunch
with my grandfather.

150
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:56,498
All right, well, have fun.

151
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,839
I really just wanted to say
thank you again for last week.

152
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,541
I don't know
what would have happened.

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,930
You know what? Let me just
call my grandfather and cancel.

154
00:07:12,352 --> 00:07:13,745
I'm sure he'll understand.

155
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,197
The look on his face was so sad.
I wanted to call him back and say,

156
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:28,708
I didn't forget your birthday.
I've got this whole party planned.

157
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,533
Cruel to be kind, S.
Nate'll be fine.

158
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:32,993
No word from Chuck?

159
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,538
He was sitting with satan this morning.
He's gonna lay everything on the table,

160
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,895
see if there's anything
in the world he could offer Jack

161
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,460
to give up the hotel.
He's come so far,

162
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,935
become the person
I always knew he could be.

163
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,216
But he'll lose it all because he opened
his heart to that con artist.

164
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,265
Everything will be fine, Blair.
No matter what, Chuck has you,

165
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,679
and he loves you.
The Empire is just a hotel.

166
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,355
You don't understand.

167
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,875
The hotel is proof
that Bart was wrong about Chuck.

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,144
It's become who he is.

169
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,314
Well, then you have to show him
that he has so much more,

170
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,782
Starting with...

171
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,390
buying this dress.

172
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,670
Come on, B.

173
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,477
Once Chuck sees you in it,
he'll realize Empire

174
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:15,650
or no Empire,
Blair Waldorf loves him,

175
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,325
and no one else can say that.

176
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,125
Thanks, S.

177
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,575
I have to go get everything
ready for Nate's party.

178
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,300
Are you gonna be okay?

179
00:08:29,937 --> 00:08:31,987
Let me know if Chuck calls you.

180
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:34,819
And buy that dress.

181
00:08:37,422 --> 00:08:40,227
She's right.
It is a remarkable dress,

182
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,101
- made only more so by you in it.
- What are you doing here,

183
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:44,356
besides stalking me?

184
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,901
Please, I was just window-shopping
and saw something I liked.

185
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,028
- You're supposed meeting Chuck.
- Oh, we met.

186
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,906
Ideas were discussed, voices raised,
expletives used.

187
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,902
And how's your morning been,
gorgeous?

188
00:08:55,027 --> 00:08:56,577
You think you've won.

189
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,655
But Chuck will find a way
to get back what you stole.

190
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,251
- There's always a way.
- I told him how to get back his hotel.

191
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,579
And here's the kicker,
it wouldn't cost him a dime.

192
00:09:05,704 --> 00:09:08,922
- What are you talking about?
- I'm saying Chuck can have the Empire,

193
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,509
and all it would cost is you,
spending the night with me.

194
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,096
How's that grab you?

195
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,220
<i>Careful, B.</i>

196
00:09:17,345 --> 00:09:20,345
<i>Jack Bass' weapon
of choice comes fully loaded,</i>

197
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,311
<i>and if he hits his target,</i>

198
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,646
<i>there'll be at least two victims.</i>

199
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,055
I'd rather spend the night
with the Marquis De Sade,

200
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,724
and yes, I know he's dead.

201
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:33,415
I'm surprised this is your response,

202
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,824
knowing how attached
Chuck is to his hotel,

203
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,036
what it means to him.
I thought you really cared for him.

204
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,495
Excuse me, I thought you
were just a disgusting pig.

205
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,425
But now I realize you're
actually demented.

206
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,585
Taking what belongs to Chuck
has become a real passion of mine,

207
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:51,006
and I would find this particular
conquest deeply satisfying.

208
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,926
While I'm flattered, I assure you
that Chuck and I will find another way.

209
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,928
Chuck opened his heart to you,

210
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,764
and now his future
lies in your hands...

211
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,917
Well, not your hands, exactly.

212
00:10:03,914 --> 00:10:05,564
But you could fix this.

213
00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:08,812
He would never have to know.

214
00:10:09,446 --> 00:10:11,020
Chuck will win,

215
00:10:11,907 --> 00:10:14,780
and I'll be right by his side,
as long as it takes for that to happen.

216
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,189
As long as you're at his side

217
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,060
and not mine,

218
00:10:20,548 --> 00:10:21,870
that will never happen.

219
00:10:27,232 --> 00:10:29,232
You should at least try it on.

220
00:10:38,373 --> 00:10:39,895
I was about to call you.

221
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,414
You know that polaroid film
I told you I had? I don't.

222
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:44,694
I promised Serena
that I would get it for Nate's party.

223
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:47,325
We need it
for the game of "Assassin."

224
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,772
This is the one thing she gave me to do,
if I messed up, she'll kill me,

225
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:53,902
- and not in a fun game way.
- Done.

226
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,532
Now what's wrong? Is it because
Serena never threw you a surprise party?

227
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,324
Because you hate surprises.

228
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:02,494
No. Vanessa, she wrote this script.

229
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,393
- She wants me to read it.
- And?

230
00:11:04,518 --> 00:11:06,264
- It's not great.
- Give her notes.

231
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:08,336
That's what you guys
do with each other's work.

232
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:10,105
Well, yeah, as friends.

233
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,587
I think, there's
such a thing as too much honesty.

234
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,817
For instance, it would not have been
a good idea for me to tell Serena

235
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,586
how I felt about
every outfit she wore.

236
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:21,303
Telling a woman you like her clothes
is not lying, it's self-preservation.

237
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:23,155
But the truth has shades of gray.

238
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,351
- There's such a thing as spin.
- A half-truth is a whole lie, son.

239
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,146
In my experience, it causes the same
amount of problems down the line,

240
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,690
especially with the ladies.

241
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,776
Serena must have something really great
planned for you guys tonight?

242
00:11:37,901 --> 00:11:39,740
Yeah, some toad gala at the Frick.

243
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,743
- That sounds...
- Boring? Yeah, I know.

244
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,203
It's not like I had
some high expectations.

245
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,037
I just expected Serena
to be a little more...

246
00:11:48,162 --> 00:11:49,406
I mean, you know.

247
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:52,336
Basically, this burger is definitely
the best part of my day so far.

248
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,604
It's the best part of mine, too.

249
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,810
Actually, you know,
the best part of the week.

250
00:11:59,142 --> 00:12:02,142
How are you, after that
whole thing at Eleanor's?

251
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,535
You know you can always
come to me, right?

252
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,893
Yeah, thanks.

253
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,971
But today is not about me.

254
00:12:13,096 --> 00:12:15,067
Did I mention that
public embarrassment

255
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,035
is a part of the Humphrey
birthday tradition?

256
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,739
Okay, I'm actually
happy to be humiliated.

257
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,160
Good. Blow out your candle.
Make a wish.

258
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,717
Okay, bye.

259
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,845
I brought my trench coat, camera.

260
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,715
Prepare to be assassinated.

261
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,140
Will do. Thanks.

262
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:41,241
Something wrong?

263
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,679
Oh, you read my script...

264
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:47,724
and you didn't like it.

265
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:50,705
I can take it, I think.

266
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:55,357
No, you're right.
I didn't, uh, I didn't like it.

267
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:00,904
I loved it.

268
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,730
Really? Loved it?

269
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,255
- No notes?
- No, only note I've got is I wish...

270
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,371
I wish there was more of it.

271
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,205
Yeah, so what did
you think of my play?

272
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,419
Oh, um, I didn't get a
chance to read it yet.

273
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:19,297
No worries. But I do have to get
the application in day after tomorrow.

274
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,465
Okay.

275
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:27,514
- Oh, Miss Serena, I about to text.
- Dorota, what is going on?

276
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,163
Everything should be done by now.
Everyone's gonna be here soon.

277
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:32,235
Vans get messed up.
Dead body cake go to wedding.

278
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,261
Wedding cake come here.
It's very pretty,

279
00:13:34,386 --> 00:13:37,955
- but pink not Mr. Nate's color.
- Oh, my god. We have to stall Nate.

280
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,505
- William has to keep him occupied.
- No cookies like hearts!

281
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,905
Find bullets and knives and
little bombs that go boom!

282
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,000
Mr. Van Der Bilt, it's Serena,
but don't tell Nate.

283
00:13:49,782 --> 00:13:50,832
Okay.

284
00:13:51,758 --> 00:13:54,258
Yeah,
I'll let him know when I see him.

285
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,972
Nate's not with him. He said
he called last-minute and cancelled.

286
00:13:59,097 --> 00:14:00,730
Then where be he?

287
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,632
Let's find out.

288
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:09,621
Well, listen, I gotta get going.
I told Serena,

289
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:12,360
I'd be there by 3:00
to get ready for the gala.

290
00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:16,396
White shirt, black tie.
I'd think you'd have it down by now.

291
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,982
Have fun tonight.

292
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,110
Yeah.

293
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,220
Are you okay?

294
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:27,073
Yeah, I'm fine.

295
00:14:29,478 --> 00:14:32,394
I don't know. It's just whenever
I'm alone, I can't

296
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,019
not think of the other night,
you know?

297
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,958
Hey, I'm sorry.

298
00:14:37,516 --> 00:14:39,716
You shouldn't keep Serena waiting.

299
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,174
It's just you're the only one who gets
what I'm going through right now.

300
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,012
I'm sure Serena won't mind
if I'm a little bit late, right?

301
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,264
Like you said,
white shirt, black tie.

302
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,232
How long can it take to
get ready for a gala?

303
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,615
<i>Attention, upper east siders.
Nate Archibald is MIA.</i>

304
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,085
<i>Send tips and pics ASAP.</i>

305
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,945
<i>Help Serena find her man.</i>

306
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,895
You know, I kind of just
want to disappear

307
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,276
in the dark for a while.
Do you want to go see a movie?

308
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:16,968
- I'm in.
- Okay.

309
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,360
Thank you, Gregor.

310
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,405
Back from shopping and no packages?

311
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,815
Who are you, and what have
you done with my girlfriend?

312
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,778
Nothing suited my sensibilities.

313
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,165
How was your talk with Jack?

314
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,642
I was wrong to think I could
negotiate with terrorists.

315
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,762
Did he offer you anything?

316
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:39,887
Nothing I would ever consider.

317
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,177
Maybe when he sees he can't get what
he wants, he'll stop toying with you.

318
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:54,702
One can only hope.

319
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:01,981
Hello?

320
00:16:03,906 --> 00:16:04,906
Thank you.

321
00:16:10,157 --> 00:16:11,407
You were right.

322
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,180
After I said no to Jack's offer,

323
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,933
he's called off the game play.

324
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,060
He's closing the hotel.

325
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,030
It's over.

326
00:16:33,098 --> 00:16:35,415
Miss Blair,
this package arrive for you.

327
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,037
There is card.

328
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:51,502
<i>Careful, B.</i>

329
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:54,685
<i>don't forget
your first rule of battle...</i>

330
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,891
<i>Beware of Bass's bearing gifts.</i>

331
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,275
- <i>Has Nate showed up yet?</i>
- He'll be here soon.

332
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,375
I'm really sorry.
I'm sure he'll be here any minute.

333
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,657
Any word on Nate from
Vanya's doorman contacts?

334
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,603
Dorota has pretty much
the entire eastern block on lookout.

335
00:17:16,728 --> 00:17:17,994
Anything on "Gossip Girl"?

336
00:17:21,553 --> 00:17:24,686
- I'm gonna keep looking.
- Serena, come here.

337
00:17:25,373 --> 00:17:28,076
You've done some unforgivable things
like having sex with Nate

338
00:17:28,201 --> 00:17:30,644
when we're saving ourselves
for each other or killing Pete Fairman.

339
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:32,384
- What?
- How far is too far?

340
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,595
Where is that place
you can't come back from anymore?

341
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,681
What are you talking about?
Is Chuck gonna do something to Jack?

342
00:17:39,461 --> 00:17:41,351
I mean... yes.

343
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,140
There is something someone could do
to get back the Empire,

344
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,065
and it is terrible,

345
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,775
but they'd be doing it out of love.

346
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,808
- Love of whom?
- Just love.

347
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:53,225
The point is,
if someone does something awful,

348
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,825
- but it's for love, is it okay?
- If you are crossing some moral line

349
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,411
to best Jack Bass,
then probably not.

350
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,996
- What are you not telling me?
- Nothing. You're right.

351
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,540
Thank you.

352
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,291
I should go get dressed.

353
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,670
Oh, and I invited my minions.

354
00:18:08,953 --> 00:18:10,865
It'll be like shooting
fish in a barrel.

355
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,490
Hey, Jenny. It's me.

356
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:15,922
I just wanted to remind you
that Nate needed to be here

357
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:19,222
no later than an hour ago.
Bring him to the party right now.

358
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,605
Hey, where's Nate?

359
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,226
I'm determined to believe
he'll arrive momentarily.

360
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,255
He'll better,
with his Columbia friends here.

361
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,689
- I start taking pictures of people?
- Yes, please.

362
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,707
I'll grab Vanessa's camera.

363
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,262
- Do you need something?
- Camera. Here.

364
00:18:53,237 --> 00:18:55,278
Smile like the killer you are.

365
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,320
Are you gonna come down
and join the party?

366
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,397
I just heard from my lawyers.

367
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,355
I was waiting to see
if there was any chance

368
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,443
- of keeping the Empire doors open.
- And?

369
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,905
There's not. Jack's within his
rights to shutter the place.

370
00:19:17,548 --> 00:19:21,659
I just have to watch it die,
a slow painful death.

371
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,246
When you bought the Empire,

372
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,625
you told me you knew you could
do it because I believe in you.

373
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,815
That hasn't changed.
You'll find a way.

374
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,790
When are you going to get it?
There is no way!

375
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,263
I'm sorry.

376
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,280
I'm not mad at you.
It's my own fault.

377
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:49,629
I am everything

378
00:19:50,849 --> 00:19:52,156
my father said I was.

379
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,365
Oh. Even without the guest of honor,
it's still a great party.

380
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,605
- I can't believe he didn't even call.
- Well, you did steal his phone.

381
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,815
You have a point,
but we did have plans,

382
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,109
even if it was a made-up ball
for a non-endangered reptile.

383
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,152
You're freaking me
out with the nunchakus.

384
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,905
He probably thinks
that I didn't care about his birthday.

385
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,532
Surprise!

386
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,760
<i>Surprise!</i>

387
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,890
Sorry we're late, everyone!

388
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,742
Crazy, you.

389
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,043
<i>Uh-oh, S. Looks like
little J's knives are sharpened,</i>

390
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,423
<i>ad she's ready to use them
in the battle for Nate Archibald.</i>

391
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,262
The game of "assassin" is simple...
kill or be killed.

392
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:08,349
Your photo is your life.
You wear it around your neck.

393
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,005
If someone grabs your picture
before you grab theirs,

394
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,555
ten you're dead, and you have
to give them all the pictures

395
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,805
of everyone else you've killed.
Once you're a ghost,

396
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,067
you come back here to
the safe zone for the party.

397
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:22,015
You can't go beyond this block,
but restaurants, buildings,

398
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,573
shops... all fair game.

399
00:21:23,955 --> 00:21:26,326
The winner is the last
assassin on the street,

400
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,161
and they have all the other photos.

401
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:32,040
So you have five safe minutes
to leave the building.

402
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,480
Starting now.

403
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,575
I can't believe you were in on this.
Nicely played.

404
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,006
Thank you.

405
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,509
I figured someone had
to keep him distracted.

406
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,105
I gotta go before I end up dead.

407
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,057
I can't believe you did this.
It's awesome.

408
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,925
I mean, you totally had me going.

409
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,646
Apparently. What, were you just
not gonna show up to the gala?

410
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,814
What? No.
Something with Jenny just came up.

411
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,332
Yeah, I got that.

412
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:01,135
Okay, we have exactly
four minutes left to live.

413
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,260
Do you really want to
spend it talking like this?

414
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,315
Hey, come on. Game's starting.

415
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,326
- Let's go.
- I'm already dead.

416
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,995
- You still have your photo.
- Formality.

417
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,320
Although you're welcome to
kill me again if you like.

418
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,776
Hello, Dorota.

419
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,946
What are you doing here?
I will be killed if someone find me.

420
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,658
Why would somebody kill you?
Antiroyalists from Russia?

421
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,702
No. In game.

422
00:23:33,985 --> 00:23:36,535
Then I must do something
before you die.

423
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,255
Dorota...

424
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,645
from the first moment I saw you,

425
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,843
I knew you were princess.

426
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,180
And every day
you make me feel like king.

427
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,715
Will you...

428
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,713
Yes, yes! Yes, of course
I will marry you!

429
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,407
At least now I die with happiness.

430
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,495
Oh! Oh, Vanya, I'm so sorry.

431
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,579
Hey. You okay?

432
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:19,791
Uh, yeah, I am. Are you... Okay?

433
00:24:20,313 --> 00:24:21,668
I am engaged.

434
00:24:24,412 --> 00:24:26,130
Congratulations, both of you.

435
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,345
Sorry. A friend's housekeeper
and our doorman just got engaged.

436
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,434
But you obviously got that,
the engagement.

437
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,015
 That's pretty self-explanatory.

438
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,150
It's the all-black outfit
that's throwing me.

439
00:24:38,275 --> 00:24:40,479
I'm in the middle
of a game of assassin.

440
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:44,482
Please continue on your way. I'd hate
to contribute to your untimely death.

441
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,180
It looks like I'm safe for a moment.
Do you live in the building?

442
00:24:47,305 --> 00:24:49,362
No, I just like hanging out
in random lobbies,

443
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,240
overhearing marriage proposals and
looking for pickup games of assassin.

444
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,035
This is definitely your lucky day.

445
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,410
Indeed.

446
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:07,851
There is actually something that
I have to take care of for a minute,

447
00:25:07,976 --> 00:25:10,383
but dead or alive,
I will be right back.

448
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:12,787
Yeah, thanks.

449
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,605
Thank you.

450
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,355
<i>Hey, get out of my truck!</i>

451
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,185
Now, if you'll excuse me,

452
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,077
I have more important prey to hunt.

453
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,993
Ooh. You might want to call Rufus
and say your good-byes.

454
00:25:58,118 --> 00:26:00,266
Okay. I'm kind of into
this killer side of you.

455
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:02,226
I'd hate you died without
reading my script.

456
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,853
I will.
I know your deadline.

457
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:08,114
You know, I'll give you another copy
'Cause this one is pretty marked up.

458
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,755
I'm sorry, Dan.
I didn't know what to do.

459
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,657
I gonna tell you, but you liked mine
that I didn't know what to say.

460
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,993
- You felt sorry for me?
- That's not what I meant.

461
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,475
Well, good.
As long as we're being honest,

462
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,539
your script was not an A+.

463
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,791
It was a "D."

464
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,005
At least you'll be
together on the other side.

465
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,178
I don't care about the game.

466
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,055
- We need to talk.
- Okay. About what?

467
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:40,932
- What're you doing?
- Keeping Nate busy.

468
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,017
- That wasn't the plan.
- We're just friends.

469
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,833
Friends don't kiss friends at their
fashion shows. You have history.

470
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:49,232
Ancient. I promise I don't give
Nate the wrong impression.

471
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,192
- Now is that all?
- No.

472
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,904
- You can't kill me you're already dead.
- No, I'm not.

473
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,222
Yes, you are.

474
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,325
Any last words before I open
this door and murder you?

475
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,495
Look, I know you thought
that I blew off your birthday,

476
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,025
- but you did ditch me.
- Well...

477
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,235
Serena, it wasn't like that.

478
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,260
I need to know why you ignored
our plans to spend the day with Jenny.

479
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,067
Well, I promised her
I wouldn't say anything.

480
00:27:33,832 --> 00:27:36,487
Okay, last week something really
messed up happened to her.

481
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,525
- And she came to you about it?
- Only because I was involved.

482
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,625
Well, that's not making
me feel any better.

483
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,045
Okay, some girls from
Eleanor's fashion show...

484
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,305
they roofie'd her,
and dumped her off at some bar

485
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,780
- with all these guys.
- Oh, my god. I... Is she okay?

486
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,837
Yeah. I mean, I got there before
anything actually happened,

487
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:56,355
But, you know, she's...
she's having a tough time.

488
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,080
I'm sorry.

489
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,265
You're such a good guy,
Nate Archibald.

490
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,100
Can I kiss you before I kill you?

491
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,335
Gotcha. Watch your back.

492
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,865
Well, looks like it's
just you and Nate left.

493
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,550
I'm on it.

494
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,130
Chuck, have you seen Blair?

495
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:39,675
- I assume she's still slaying.
- She can't be. Her polaroid's here.

496
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,970
You know Blair.
She's probably cheating.

497
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,329
If you'll excuse me a moment...

498
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,020
<i>When all other weapons fail,</i>

499
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:36,397
<i>there's always human sacrifice.</i>

500
00:29:40,824 --> 00:29:43,935
I knew the memory of
our new year's together

501
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,500
- would bring you back.
- I'm not here for you.

502
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,175
I'm here to get Chuck's hotel.

503
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,325
- Eh, semantics, really.
- I've had a contract drawn up.

504
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:56,335
Now suddenly you don't trust me?
What are your demands?

505
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,506
"No kissing" seems to be, you know,
some working girls' rule of thumb.

506
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:09,181
You'll tell Chuck that you realized he
isn't worth losing Bass Australia over.

507
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,601
Now that you've devalued the Empire,
you're willing to sell it back,

508
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,895
at a profit, of course,
so he doesn't suspect anything.

509
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,470
You know I love
a win-win proposition.

510
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,099
And Chuck can never know.

511
00:30:21,197 --> 00:30:24,071
I think I've already proven
I'm not one to kiss and tell.

512
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,390
Fine.

513
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,395
I've... I've already had his hotel.

514
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,670
Now I'll leave knowing I've had
the thing he holds even dearer.

515
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,715
Everything that was his is mine.

516
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,971
That dress looks almost
as beautiful on as I'm sure it will off.

517
00:30:52,008 --> 00:30:53,267
But first, a drink.

518
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,375
Oh, I'm sorry.
She's trying to kill me.

519
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,340
Yeah, only...
because he's trying to kill me.

520
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,500
The grilled cheese with truffles
is really good, by the way.

521
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,220
Looks like it's "till
death do us part."

522
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,594
Someday maybe you girls
find true love, too...

523
00:31:27,223 --> 00:31:29,678
and your children not
grow up to be bastards.

524
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,516
Congratulations, Dorota, Vanya.

525
00:31:34,699 --> 00:31:37,728
Dorota do you remember the guy
that I was talking to in the lobby?

526
00:31:38,511 --> 00:31:40,875
I don't even remember own name.

527
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,484
All a blur of sparkly...

528
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,441
So, uh, it...
it wasn't a "D", it wasn't.

529
00:31:53,056 --> 00:31:54,370
But it wasn't an A+, either.

530
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,585
I did think the male
character's dialogue

531
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,625
sounded a little bit like a girl,
you know, so...

532
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,775
I can see that.
Thanks for being honest.

533
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,665
- That's actually a really helpful note.
- Well, you gotta do me now.

534
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,215
Tear me to pieces. Be brutal.

535
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:09,593
- I think you're an amazing writer.
- Really? That brutal?

536
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,889
It's just, a play about
a homeless man winning the lottery?

537
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,657
It seems a little out
of your wheelhouse.

538
00:32:17,463 --> 00:32:20,312
Well, all right. Well, I was, you know,
I was trying to show some range.

539
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,898
I know. But when you write about
what you know, you're amazing.

540
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,859
Like that story about graduating
from St. Jude's, having never fit in.

541
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,827
That was really beautiful.

542
00:32:27,952 --> 00:32:30,225
See, what would have happened
if you didn't tell me this,

543
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:33,280
and I sent the wrong one
with my Tisch application?

544
00:32:34,468 --> 00:32:35,869
They would've loved you anyway.

545
00:32:36,527 --> 00:32:38,531
- Sure you're not lying again?
- Never.

546
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,798
Trying to kill you
is the best time I've had in months.

547
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,326
That's a great reason
to let me live.

548
00:32:53,447 --> 00:32:55,120
You are the birthday boy.

549
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:57,308
I should let you kill me.

550
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:11,280
You're dead.

551
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,825
Champagne okay?

552
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,575
I prefer something stronger
to kill the germs.

553
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,300
It must be lonely for you

554
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:30,886
with Chuck under all this pressure.

555
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:35,137
Has the stress compromised his ability
to perform romantically?

556
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,821
I'm here because I love Chuck.

557
00:33:37,777 --> 00:33:40,351
Don't flatter yourself
into thinking I'm going to enjoy this.

558
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,385
Whatever you need to tell yourself.

559
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:47,191
I think we've had enough foreplay.

560
00:34:05,618 --> 00:34:06,726
Thank you.

561
00:34:08,635 --> 00:34:09,588
What?

562
00:34:09,904 --> 00:34:11,674
That's it?
You already signed the contract.

563
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:14,343
- You can't go back now.
- Don't worry. Chuck will get his hotel.

564
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:17,171
Contrary to what you believe, I prefer
the woman to want to sleep with me.

565
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,057
I don't understand. If you don't want
me, then why did you set this up?

566
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:24,147
I told Chuck
I'd take either you or the hotel.

567
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,689
He chose to give me you.

568
00:34:29,565 --> 00:34:32,000
No. What are you talking about?

569
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:34,029
- Chuck doesn't know about this.
- Really?

570
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:37,866
Because it seems to me he knew exactly
which buttons to have me push.

571
00:34:38,832 --> 00:34:41,025
Said you wouldn't be able
to resist stepping in

572
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,686
to save him behind his back.

573
00:34:44,192 --> 00:34:47,876
You were there while I was shopping.
Only yousaw this dress.

574
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,087
And who do you think sent me
to that store?

575
00:34:50,473 --> 00:34:52,602
I'd never drop that kind of money
on a dress.

576
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,260
My goal was to destroy Chuck.

577
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,930
But now that he has you,
I had to break that bond.

578
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:04,285
Chuck would never do this to me.

579
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,765
If you don't believe me,
check his credit card receipts.

580
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:07,889
I'm sorry, Blair.

581
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,899
Just be grateful one of the Bass men
has some moral integrity.

582
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:16,029
Although, if you're interested
in some revenge sex...

583
00:35:17,436 --> 00:35:19,075
I'd be more than happy to oblige.

584

<i>Arms are laid down,</i>

585
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,270
<i>only to realize
you've been hit by friendly fire.</i>

586
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:40,206
Okay, so what the hell was that?

587
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:43,515
What?
We were playing, and I killed you.

588
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:45,872
Jenny, us hanging out was...

589
00:35:46,495 --> 00:35:47,352
as friends.

590
00:35:48,745 --> 00:35:49,703
Yeah, I know.

591
00:35:49,828 --> 00:35:52,941
Nate, seriously, I thought that you'd be
happy I was finally having fun again.

592
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:01,662
Guys,

593
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,069
I won.

594
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,237
Congratulations.

595
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,545
Thank you.

596
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,420
I'm glad it's over.

597
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,064
- How could you lose?
- Oh, stop it.

598
00:36:28,398 --> 00:36:29,311
Home so soon?

599
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,565
Tell me Jack was lying,

600
00:36:34,436 --> 00:36:36,913
- That you wouldn't betray me like that.
- Me, betray you?

601
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:40,475
You're the one who just came
from seeing my uncle.

602
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,992
I went there for you because I thought
it was the only way to save your hotel.

603
00:36:49,136 --> 00:36:51,117
I would've done anything
to help you.

604
00:36:51,753 --> 00:36:53,168
All you had to do was ask.

605
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,620
If I asked, it wouldn't have worked.
You would have been too willing.

606
00:37:00,745 --> 00:37:03,345
When Jack came to you, he would've known
we were working together.

607
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,967
I did what I had to win.

608
00:37:07,406 --> 00:37:08,632
I can't let my feelings

609
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,519
cost me all that I've built.

610
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:15,161
Even if it means losing me instead?

611
00:37:19,842 --> 00:37:21,238
All I ever did was love you.

612
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,244
"The worst thing I ever did,

613
00:37:28,116 --> 00:37:29,983
the darkest thought I ever had."

614
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,667
You said you would stand by me
through anything.

615
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:35,638
This, Blair,

616
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:37,885
is "anything."

617
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:41,300
I never thought that the worst thing
you would ever do would be to me.

618
00:37:44,753 --> 00:37:46,371
You went up there on your own.

619
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,622
Good-bye, Chuck.

620
00:38:26,202 --> 00:38:28,059
Hey. I'm sorry for tricking you.

621
00:38:28,184 --> 00:38:29,840
Oh, it was worth it.

622
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:32,479
Seriously? Best birthday ever.

623
00:38:33,777 --> 00:38:34,984
It's not over yet.

624
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:37,187
I still have to give you
your present.

625
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,123
Hey, Jenny, you ready?
I'm gonna grab our coats.

626
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:48,360
Yeah, I'm done.

627
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,615
I mean, yeah, I'm ready to go.

00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,305
Professor Romano
sent this over earlier.

631
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,809
You weren't here,
so the messenger left it with me.

632
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,828
I didn't know you were applying
to the Tisch writing program.

633
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,573
I'm kind of not telling anyone.

634
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:33,078
It's really competitive. There are
only a few spots for NYU transfers.

635
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,872
- I hope you get in.
- Thanks.

Hey, there you are.
I think you lost this.

638
00:39:55,571 --> 00:39:56,601
Thanks.

639
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:04,317
- How'd you know where I lived?
- I started at the bottom and went up.

640
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,405
You do realize
that this is the penthouse, right?

641
00:40:11,524 --> 00:40:12,534
I'm Eric.

642
00:40:13,734 --> 00:40:14,828

645

Welcome home, Chuck.

646
00:40:39,768 --> 00:40:41,270
You're not mad at me, are you?

647
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:43,950
You didn't actually believe

648
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:46,770
Blair could sleep with me
and you two would be okay?

649
00:40:47,939 --> 00:40:49,696
Or are you mad because I told her?

650
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:50,807
Security,

651
00:40:51,429 --> 00:40:52,491
I need Jack Bass

652
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:55,243
escorted from my penthouse
immediately.

653
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,170
You may have told her

654
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:03,460
- but Blair and I will get past this.
- Is that what you think?

655
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,164
Don't you get it, Chuck?

656
00:41:06,483 --> 00:41:08,301
Blair's seen the real you now.

657
00:41:09,246 --> 00:41:10,550
It's over.

658
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,512
She could never love that.

659
00:41:14,867 --> 00:41:16,181
No one could.

660
00:41:18,426 --> 00:41:20,281
Hope the Empire's everything
you wanted

00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,280
