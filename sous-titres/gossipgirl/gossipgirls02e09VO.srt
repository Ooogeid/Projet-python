1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,200
Gossip Girl here ...

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,730
Your one and only source into the scandalous lives

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,270
Of manhattan's elite. You confided in dan and even blair.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,350
Everyone but me.So that's it?

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,850
We can't even be friends? Well, we were never really friends, remember?

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,770
Hope you don't mind, but we've,we've got a lodger.Make yourself at home.

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,500
Have you seen my sketchbook? Whoa, sorry! Oh, my god.

8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,850
Yale is your dream,

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,530
And you deserve to go here more than I do. You can't share this.

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,430
We'll find a way. I'm gonna give you a second chance.

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,860
If you can tell me the fate of cecil the caterpillar,

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,720
I will go out with you. I just realized that i-i do know aaron.

13
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,930
We went to summer camp together. We got married.

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,560
There was a small ceremony with licorice

15
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,610
Rings. You should do your own clothing line

16
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,690
I can model them. Max will do some photos.

17
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,020
That guy was taking advantage of you.

18
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,960
You are not my father, and you are not my brother

19
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,770
So why do you care so much?

20
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,430
Can I at least have my dress back?

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,850
You touch this dress, you will never set foot in here again

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,860
Spotted at minh--jenny humphrey buying 16 yards of tulle.

23
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,600
But since when does eleanor waldorf

24
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,000
Pay for her purchases with a penny jar?

25
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,520
They say a stitch in time saves nine.

26
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,180
Will it save little j.?

27
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,950
We are going to blow them away.

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,880
We better, otherwise I am so dead.

29
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,540
Dude, have you seen the time? At least your brother and the lodger

30
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,640
Went to go see a movie. Yeah, that's nate avoiding me once again.

31
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,000
He's still acting like

32
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,620
He didn't stick his tongue down your throat? Yeah. Ew.

33
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,580
Well, amnesia doesn't really happen till after sex with guys,

34
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,960
So what's his problem? I don't know. He used to date vanessa?

35
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,250
I'm dan's little sister? Too young? I wouldn't know.

36
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,290
We don't talk. So what? After tonight you'll be so famous,

37
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,860
You'll have ten nate archibalds. Yeah, except I only want the one.

38
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,190
Okay, fine, then you have to make the move.

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,790
That's the only way it's gonna work.

40
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,380
Oh, my god. Is that the time? I told you.

41
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,020
Okay, yeah. You need to sew way faster,

42
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,680
'cause we are so screwed. 'cause ready or not,

43
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,530
We're putting on a fashion show.

44
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,050
I just--i think they're up to something, man

45
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,470
With their closed doors and this private thing for eleanor.

46
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,220
Jenny--she didn't say anything to you?

47
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,070
Uh, no, no. But we haven't talked much this week, so...

48
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,020
She seemed weirdly happy that we were leaving the house

49
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,250
Like how much privacy does she really need

50
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,320
To watch "project runway" and eat pizza?

51
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,600
Oh, oh. Hold on a second. Ooh, it's jordan. Who?

52
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,110
The, uh, you know, the t.A. From yale.

53
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,430
She was trying to get me a recommendation?

54
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,460
You--you hooked up with her.

55
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,600
Oh, yeah, that's right. Jordan.

56
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,210
Oh, it's good to be nate.

57
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,790
"i had three professors read your stories.

58
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,750
I'll call you later." hey, that sounds like good news.

59
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,840
Good? No. It means she had the first one read it.

60
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,130
He didn't like it. Neither did the second,

61
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,810
And after the third, she probably just gave up.

62
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,490
And why text before calling if you don't need

63
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,140
To soften the blow? Or she was somewhere she couldn't talk,

64
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,320
So she sent a text. With an imagination like that, you should be a writer.

65
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,110
Hey, where are you going? I-i can't concentrate on a movie right now.

66
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,190
I-i-i gotta--i gotta go home and stare at my phone.

67
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,180
Maybe you could talk to jenny, figure out what's going on.

68
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,110
Yeah, sounds like a great idea.

69
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:07,890
My father went to yale,

70
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,700
And I've wanted to go there ever since I was a little girl.

71
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,810
How nice.

72
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,510
So, serena, tell me about karl

73
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,070
Lagerfeld's birthday party. Oh, it--it was fun

74
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,600
But did you know blair's mother is a designer?

75
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,370
You know, when dean berube suggested I meet with you,

76
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,400
I had no idea you would be such a delight.

77
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,280
Yes, thank you. Bye. Oh, excuse me. My husband's on his way out.

78
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,020
Malchus, this is serena van der woodsen. Good afternoon.

79
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,940
Uh, hi, and  best friend blair waldorf.

80
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,270
Pleased to meet you.

81
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,690
What am I doing here?

82
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,700
Liz and her husband are both prominent yale donors

83
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,680
And good friends with the dean. Well,

84
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,850
Just like their good friend the dean

85
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,390
They only have eyes for you. Come on,

86
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,130
B., you can do this. Yale is your dream

87
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:54,060
Just stop cracking your knuckles. Well, as pleasant as this has been,

88
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,330
I'm afraid I'm going to have to run.

89
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,960
My husband's off to his business dinner,

90
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,940
And before I meet my friends from bryn mawr,

91
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,820
I have to order room service for my daughter.

92
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,280
Oh, no. She's gonna be here by herself all night

93
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,820
Oh, emma doesn't mind. As long as she has her harry potter book

94
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,440
And a bowl of ice cream, she's happy as a clam.

95
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,240
Uh, no, blair will take her to a movie.

96
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,640
I-i would take her myself,

97
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,760
But I've got something with my family, so... Why, emma would love that.

98
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,030
You sure you don't mind? Emma, dear?

99
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,300
Come here.

100
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,420
Anything for the friends of dean berube.

101
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,600
Yes, mother? Serena's friend...

102
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,330
Blair.

103
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,720
Yes, would like to take you to a movie.

104
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,380
Oh, thank you.

105
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,680
This is gonna be fun.

106
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,810
Hello.

107
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,730
Hey. Um, what are you doing here?

108
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,560
Uh, I just had a meeting with the collector.

109
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,710
So did you figure out... Cecil the caterpillar. Camp suisse.

110
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,180
We got married and exchanged licorice rings.

111
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,160
And you ate your five minutes after the ceremony. Yeah.

112
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,200
When did you finally remember? Um,

113
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,310
About the time you were speeding away with a gir

114
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,650
On the back of your motorcycle.

115
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,750
Audra. Yeah, she's just a friend.

116
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,190
No, I recognized you the moment you walked

117
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,490
In the gallery. No, you didn't, but it's okay

118
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,020
Some faces you don't forget.

119
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:24,480
Um...  You know, I have this charity gala.

120
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,490
It's actually here, and I wouldn't normally go,

121
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,520
But my mom's being honored and my brother's out of town,

122
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,290
And I'm rambling, but I was wondering... I'm late! I know.

123
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,460
I was thinking maybe we could, uh... Mm. I'm sorry.

124
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,120
Hey, uh, maybe in another nine years.

125
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,060
What was that about?

126
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,280
Jenny, come on. The van is almost here.

127
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,850
Eleanor's going to kill herself after tonight.

128
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,030
I know. I just have a few more things to do.

129
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,550
Dan?

130
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,270
What are you doing here?

131
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:00,670
I spy with my little eye someone getting busted.

132
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,130
Is my mom gone?

133
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,460
Yes.

134
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,920
So what kind of movies do you like?

135
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,460
Something where the animals sing or...

136
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,780
Oh, sweet heaven.

137
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,920
So muffy mcdonough's been bragging

138
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,570
About how she's gonna lose her virginity

139
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,980
'cause she finally landed a date with the lacrosse captain.

140
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,180
They call him "the de-virginator."

141
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,980
Oh, my god. Stop your mouth from moving.

142
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,210
But now that I finally have the night away from mom and dad,

143
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,250
We'll see who's first.

144
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,280
I'm saying t.T.F.N.

145
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,010
To my you know what. Ormaybe we'll see how your mom feel

146
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,740
About your little clearance sale, lohan.

147
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,900
Please. I heard you talking about getting into yale.

148
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,510
Well, dean berube is, like, my uncle,

149
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,820
So help me or I tell him how you took me to a club

150
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,010
And got me wasted. Rumor has it that

151
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,150
Lady b.'s been outfoxed by a young fox

152
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,830
Got a credit card, fake i.D., and I want bacardi and a boy.

153
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,930
This body's open for business.

154
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,670
It seems only one ivory tower has been stormed tonight.

155
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,880
You quit eleanor's? I had to. She was using me.

156
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,640
Does dad know about it? No, of course dad doesn't know.

157
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,630
What am I saying? You haven't been shipped off

158
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,180
To a convent yet. Hey, dan, just take it easy.

159
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,500
Nate, look, I'm sorry, but this is none of your

160
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,600
Business. Dan, I promise I'll tell dad everything tomorrow

161
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,370
I just--i really need tonight.

162
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,640
I've worked so hard. For--for what? What is this

163
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,370
Stop! We're putting on a guerilla

164
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,020
Fashion show. I don't know what that means

165
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,080
Okay. These dresses--i made them.

166
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,150
And--and agnes and her friends are gonna model.

167
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,160
Please, dan. Tonight's the one chance

168
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,050
I have to show everyone what I can do.

169
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,720
Ivan, I swear if that van's not here in ten minutes,

170
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,820
You're not getting those photos of me.

171
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,400
Are we busted now or what?

172
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,300
Dan, please. I just need a few hours.

173
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,970
Then I'll tell dad everything.

174
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:41,980
All right.

175
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,530
I, uh, i-i just need to think.

176
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,430
Well, you finally did it--

177
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,780
Made absolutely sure I'm never gonna

178
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,700
Get into yale. What are you talking about

179
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,800
Little emma--turns out she's less holly hobbie

180
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,800
And more jenna jameson. Can you speak plainly?

181
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,130
She's determined to become a woman on my watch,

182
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,740
And if I don't help pimp her out, she's gonna

183
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,200
Character-assassinate me to the dean.

184
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,420
I don't understand. I thought she liked ice cream and magic

185
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,180
Next time leave the scheming to the experts.

186
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,410
What are those? Pictures from camp suisse

187
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,710
Aaron dressed up as cecil the caterpillar.

188
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,780
I bumped into him outside the palace.

189
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,680
The guy gave you a ring pop when you were

190
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,490
6. Move on. It was licorice, and I was 8

191
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,870
Ancient, unimportant history. Focus, serena.

192
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,720
You got me into this, and I'm not losing yale

193
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,020
Because of that little tart's libido.

194
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,840
Why don't you just occupy her for a while

195
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,920
Take her to the charity gala. When you get there,

196
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,660
You can say you didn't know how lame it would be.

197
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,720
Then it's time for her to go home. You're off the hook.

198
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,440
So I checked out "gossip girl,"

199
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,980
And I'm thinking we hit socialista

200
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:49,270
Before beatrice. See what I'm dealing with

201
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,850
Emma, I was thinking, where is the glory

202
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,030
In bedding down with some dirty manhattan hipster

203
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,160
Who's probably filming you on the nanny cam?

204
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,340
You really want to make muffy jealous?

205
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,610
Have your flower plucked by one of the elite.

206
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,070
And where would I find someone like that?

207
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,640
Luckily, we know the place.

208
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,770
But you're gonna have to pay a visit to my closet first.

209
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,230
Sorry. Thing about a caf?- people weirdly want service.

210
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,730
Come on, v., what-- what am I gonna do?

211
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,080
You gotta give me something here. She's telling your dad tomorrow,

212
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,290
And whatever this whole fashion show thing is,

213
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,950
It sounds like she put a lot of work into it.

214
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,890
So we--we all just cover for her--you, me, nate

215
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,630
Don't lump me with nate. He's your friend.

216
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,890
Are--are we ever gonna talk about this?

217
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,530
He was living there with no electricity,

218
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,180
No furniture-- you did the right thing

219
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,740
Which is why you haven't been to the loft since he moved in.

220
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,960
Just tell me. Do you still have feelings for him? Nate hates me.

221
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,110
That's not what I asked. Nate and I tried. It didn't work. End of story.

222
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,660
I'm just saying, if you like him,

223
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,940
You should tell him, 'cause nate is a good guy.

224
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,790
It's funny how you're ready to condemn your sister,

225
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,160
But nate, who's done some pretty questionable things,

226
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,390
Gets a free pass. I get she lied-- no. No. It's not about the lying.

227
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,000
I-i don't want her to get in trouble.

228
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,590
What if she's about to make a huge, life-altering mistake,

229
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,820
And I don't stop her?

230
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,790
Who's about to make a huge mistake?

231
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,050
Well, what do we have here?

232
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,820
Allow me to introduce myself.

233
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,450
I'm chuck.

234
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,370
Bass. Oh, my god. I read about you on "gossip girl."

235
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,290
You're-- you're like the devil.

236
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,480
Finally some truth in advertising.

237
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,720
Headed out, are we?

238
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,890
Serena, blair and I are going to the gala.

239
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,840
Hope you're coming? Well, I'm all for company on a saturday night,

240
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,870
But the only thing I like that aged is my scotch.

241
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,180
What? It's old people?

242
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,250
Blair told me it was all hot guys.

243
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,340
Sounds to me like you're being taken for a ride

244
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:03,490
Well, how about you take me for a ride instead?

245
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,960
Buckman, could you pass this to miss serena?

246
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,580
It was with the concierge.

247
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,250
Looks like you've just hooked yourself a bass.

248
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,690
You look beautiful. Can we go now?

249
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,050
Patience, love.

250
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,530
The sooner we get there, the sooner the jig is up.

251
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,150
I'll go check on the vestal virgin.

252
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,920
Left at the concierge, miss.

253
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,170
Thank you.

254
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,610
Well-played, cecil. She's gone!

255
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,680
Who? Who do you think? Emma!

256
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,780
Jenny, you should wait for dan.

257
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,240
No, there's no time. This is my one chance I have

258
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,500
To prove that I can be a designer.

259
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,470
Otherwise it's back to being little j. At constance,

260
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,830
Except worse this time, because everyone's gonna know I failed.

261
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,560
And since when are you so worried?

262
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,090
You haven't spoken two words to me all week.

263
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,470
Careful, guys! Those are couture!

264
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,570
Hey, why do you keep eating those pot brownies?

265
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,570
You know sugar makes you spaz. Jenny,

266
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,150
Come on. I mean, you know it's complicated

267
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,250
Do you care about me? Prove it.

268
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,010
Come with me.

269
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,610
Maybe I should drive.

270
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,240
Okay, guys, come on!

271
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,600
This train wagon is on the move!

272
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,500
Is that nate?

273
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,900
Hey! Hey, stop!

274
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,780
Stop!

275
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,500
Wow. A real limo.

276
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,440
This is so perfect.

277
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,220
Uh, by the way, my name is--

278
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,040
Let's not ruin it with talking.

279
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,650
Fine.

280
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,060
Spotted-- bass taking the bait...

281
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,750
Straight to business then.

282
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,440
Jailbait, that is.

283
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,380
Text him. I've texted him six times.

284
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,520
Well, text him again before he screws that girl

285
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,000
And any other chance that I had of getting

286
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,100
Into yale! I put out an a.P.B. On "gossip girl

287
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,440
With emma's facebook picture on it.

288
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,140
Every girl in manhattan will be on the lookout. Chuck!

289
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,480
You! What did you do with her?

290
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,250
Hey! She assaulted me, demanded I deflower her.

291
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,920
Oh, limos and virgins, your specialty.

292
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,200
Just so you know, while there are few things

293
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,810
I consider sacred, the back of the limo is one of them.

294
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,340
When she realized she couldn't ride this thoroughbred,

295
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,460
She bolted.

296
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,660
Last time I saw her, she was heading in a cab downtown.

297
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,280
Hey, is just texted me-- she said the bartender at 1oak

298
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,410
Says e. Boardman just used her credit

299
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,830
Card there. She didn't waste any time. Come on

300
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,000
I can't go. I have my mom's thing.

301
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:32,590
What? No! You're coming. You owe me, both of you!

302
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,850
Come on!

303
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,910
Jenny, what are we doing here at the palace?

304
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,820
This is the new york philanthropic society's

305
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,560
Annual gala. I know.

306
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,620
I'm no fashion expert, but shouldn't the people

307
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,270
Seeing your show be, like,

308
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,980
Not friends with my mom? We're looking for financial backers

309
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,560
Everyone is gonna be here tonight--

310
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,160
Fortune 500 c.E.O.S, lvmh, ppr, hearst.

311
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,840
We're looking for people with money who can get us press.

312
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,570
Well, looks like you've done your homework, but--

313
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,120
I have. Sometimes the ends have to justify the means.

314
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,830
Here. I pulled you a suit on the way out.

315
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,200
It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.

316
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,090
I don't see her.

317
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,650
I'll talk to the bartender.

318
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,720
You have to admit, the licorice ring was sweet.

319
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,670
Look, even if you're just being literal,

320
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,530
I don't want to hear another word about your albatross

321
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,170
Until we find mine.

322
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,420
There she is.

323
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,840
Oh, my god.

324
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,700
Look.

325
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,120
Looks like you got nailed, just not in the way you wanted.

326
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:10,820
Give me time.

327
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,780
Serge and I were just moving the party over to

328
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,340
His place. "serge"? Honestly, how tacky are you

329
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,570
Okay, you guys, let's go. Come on. Serena!

330
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,490
Hey, you should have called. Scott, hey.

331
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,180
Don't worry. I have a table for you. Wait! Wait! No!

332
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,490
Get out of my--stop her!

333
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,690
Emma!

334
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,640
Excu--ew!

335
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,310
Oh, my god.

336
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,800
Excuse me, miss.

337
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,840
Can I have your name, please?

338
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,860
Uh, yeah, it's erica. Erica van der woodsen.

339
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,950
Sometimes they leave off the "a."

340
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,200
My--my parents are the, uh, the guests of honor.

341
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,740
Oh. Okay, thanks.

342
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,840
What am I doing?

343
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,850
Jenny?

344
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:17,400
Hi, mrs. Bass.

345
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,910
Congratulations.

346
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,910
I didn't, uh, I didn't know you were receiving an award.

347
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,150
It's really...

348
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,070
Uh, really... It's really great.

349
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,860
Well, thank you.

350
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,030
Um, honestly, I hate being the center of attention,

351
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,830
But, um... So, um, who are you here with?

352
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,240
Oh, well, uh... She's with me.

353
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,880
Oh! Yeah, my mom couldn't make it, and, um,

354
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,130
She asked me to fill in, so I invited jenny.

355
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,400
Oh, that is so sweet. Have you seen serena?

356
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,500
No, I haven't, actually. I'm sorry. Okay.

357
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,140
Do you want to get something to drink? Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you.

358
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,540
Excuse us.

359
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,420
My god, you're shaking.

360
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,640
Yeah, I didn't--i didn't know that lily and bart

361
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,710
Were getting an award, and I'm about to ruin the night

362
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,380
Of--of people who've only ever been

363
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,110
Nice to me, nate. Then just forget about it

364
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,000
You don't have to go through with it.

365
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,650
There are other ways. No. Have you not heard anything I've said, nate?

366
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,800
This is it. Tonight's all I have. Nate, I don't even know...

367
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,900
You kissed me again.

368
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,810
I know.

369
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:33,690
So does that mean you don't regret last week?

370
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,220
I guess not.

371
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:40,090
Jenny, whatever you decide, I'm with you.

372
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,600
Okay.

373
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,120
Move!

374
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,010
I lost her out front in the crowd of identical couples.

375
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,840
Their cab is probably halfway to serge's by now,

376
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,200
If she even waits that long. She's not answering her phone.

377
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,540
Well, congratulations, s., for ruining my future again.

378
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,800
Me? I'm sorry. Who came up with the idea

379
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,440
Of me babysitting my way into yale?

380
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,220
You wouldn't have had another chance with the dean

381
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,060
If it hadn't been for me. Oh, right, you're such a celebrity.

382
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,440
"miss van der woodsen, your pillows are being fluffed

383
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,620
In the v.I.P. Section." kittens, please. I found her table.

384
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,980
You're behind the plot, bass. She already left.

385
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,350
The bartender says she's in the corner booth.

386
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,820
E. Boardman? Elizabeth.

387
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,760
That's not emma. That's her mother,

388
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:36,510
And that's not her father. Oh, my god.

389
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,310
It seems the saying's true--

390
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,150
Like mother, like daughter.

391
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,200
Or is it the other way around?

392
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,040
Oh, she's cool. Don't worry.

393
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,560
This is stewart. He's in love with me.

394
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,620
Uh, isn't he gonna get fired for this?

395
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,240
Yeah, well, he was gonna quit anyway

396
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,070
To be a professional gamer.

397
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,470
Oh, I have to check on the models.

398
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,160
Stewart, take this.

399
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,450
Do not do anything gross to my friend.

400
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,050
If you'd just come to me sooner--

401
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,200
Never mind we don't know where she is.

402
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,360
We don't even know what she's doing. I know, dad. I'm sorry. I-i just--

403
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,920
She's still not picking up. Did you try nate?

404
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,150
I did already. His phone's off. Oh,

405
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,960
I should've known better. I should never have trusted her

406
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:40,170
What? Spotted at the palace-- nate archibald and little j.

407
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,310
What is it? Um, "gossip girl." they're at the palace.

408
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,010
Let me see. There's nothing to see. Let's just go.

409
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,430
Let's get out of here now.

410
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,180
We hear lonely boy's b.F.F. Still carries a torch for nate.

411
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,580
If she finds out about little sister,

412
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,820
Wonder who'll get burnt.

413
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,500
Come--come on. You're a cab. Do that weaving thing.

414
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,770
Dad, dad, dad. It's okay. We're gonna find her, all right?

415
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,070
At least she's with nate. He'll watch out for

416
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,830
Her. He couldn't have known about this, right

417
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,340
I gotta think nate would've said something. Don't be so sure.

418
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,150
Nate didn't know. He would never keep that from us.

419
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,400
We don't know what nate would do, vanessa.

420
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,270
His morals are questionable at best.

421
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,570
Who--who would've thought that he'd date both you

422
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,900
And a certain lady?

423
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,290
And by "lady," I mean older, and by "date," I mean--

424
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,060
What's he talking about? Nothing.

425
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,000
What is up with you? What happened to,

426
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,450
"if you like him, tell him. Nate's a good guy"?

427
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,100
Are you saying--you're saying you do like

428
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,700
Him? Are you saying that he's not a good guy

429
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,760
Sounds like you still like him.

430
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,500
Is that jenny?

431
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,710
No, it's--no, it's jordan,

432
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,240
The t.A. From yale who will have to wait.

433
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,650
Come on. You gotta be kidding me!

434
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,460
You're letting the mister softee truck pass us?

435
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,480
Come on. Here.

436
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,530
Dad, that's a $1.

437
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,110
Whoa. Are you sure jenny's here?

438
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,740
Yeah. What is this?

439
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,500
A private party, sir. If you're not on the list,

440
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,370
I'm afraid I can't let you in. I'm just here to find my daughter, so--

441
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,180
Rufus? What are you doing here?

442
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,050
I-it's fine. Okay.

443
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,090
I'm--i'm gonna go look for nate. He's taller and easier to spot.

444
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,990
I'm gonna look for jenny.

445
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,570
Thanks. Uh...

446
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,530
But--well--is jenny okay? I saw her earlier.

447
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,620
What--what's going on? I was about to ask that myself.

448
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,880
Rufus. Bart, hello.

449
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,790
I need to find my daughter,

450
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,680
So if you see her, hold onto her, would you?

451
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,570
Congratulations.

452
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,840
What? I didn't invite him.

453
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,330
Let's go get a drink.

454
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,290
Thank you, god, so much. I won't let you down.

455
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,530
Chuck's seeing if the doorman knows emma's guy.

456
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,130
Why? Who cares about him?

457
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,390
Blair, no.

458
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,630
This poor little girl's mother is having an affair.

459
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,010
No wonder she's acting out. So? This is my golden ticket.

460
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,180
You are not blackmailing that woman to get into yale.

461
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,040
Serena, open your eyes! This is a sign from god.

462
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,730
He wants me to do this. This family needs help.

463
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,700
Well, no argument there. They're even more screwed up than yours.

464
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,990
So humbert humbert's name is serge grodanz.

465
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,840
His father plays tennis at the club.

466
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,230
I know where his building is. Let's go.

467
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,690
I'm going over there.

468
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,740
You know, I'm--i'm late for the gala.

469
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,280
My mom's texting me. Look, do whatever you want, blair,

470
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,660
But please save emma first.

471
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,290
Fine. We'll save

472
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,450
Little red riding hood from the big bad wolf.

473
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,870
But after that, it's bulldog, bulldog, rah, rah, rah!

474
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,190
I'm trusting you.

475
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,660
You have any bright ideas?

476
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,090
As a matter of fact, one.

477
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,940
Dan. Hey.

478
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,310
Whoa. What are you doing? What am I doing? What are you doing?

479
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,730
Or is this not you with my 15-year-old sister?

480
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,970
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, just calm down.

481
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,220
We took you into our house, nate. Look,

482
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,380
Dan, it's not like I planned on it, all right

483
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,220
Okay, things just happen. I'm sorry.

484
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,290
Come on. She's a sophomore. I'm a senior.

485
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,440
Don't act like I'm some creepy older guy.

486
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,870
No, you're the guy who traded sex for money.

487
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,670
Oh, my god. Vanessa.

488
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,810
It's amazing I don't want you with my little sister.

489
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,930
Okay, look, I'm sorry I didn't say anything about jenny, okay?

490
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,710
But you have no right to judge me.

491
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,050
Where is she?

492
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,130
Look, I don't even know. She went off to find agnes.

493
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,740
Do you want me to come help you find her? No, I don't want your help.

494
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,070
I want you to pack up your stuff and get out of our house.

495
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,980
Emma, open up.

496
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,980
Emma? I know you're in there!

497
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,930
Go away! Serge is in the bathroom,

498
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,490
And when he gets out,

499
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,240
There's gonna be one less virgin around

500
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,110
Here. I do have to admire her determination

501
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,530
I'm not letting muffy lose hers before me.

502
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:14,470
She beats me in everything. Tell her to check "gossip girl."

503
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,190
Emma? Do you have your phone? Check "gossip girl."

504
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,330
It's important.

505
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:23,420
Look, I already told you, nothing's gonna--what?!

506
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,390
It says, "muffy's muff gets stuffed." does that mean--

507
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,750
That little muffy took her first steps as a woman? Afraid so.

508
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,050
She lost her virginity and her "gossip girl" cherry

509
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:38,090
In the same night? But how did she get on "gossip girl"?

510
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,820
It pays to have connections.

511
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,080
Emma? Come here, my little princess.

512
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,560
What? Who are you?

513
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,880
Now I feel violated. Come on.

514
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,180
Piece of advice-- lose the tulip.

515
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,190
Hey, it's aaron. Leave a message.

516
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,290
Oh, if this is serena, that girl at the hotel today--

517
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,170
Not what you think. I mean, not my girlfriend,

518
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,280
If that's what you thought,

519
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,750
'cause I don't have a girlfriend, and I'm rambling.

520
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,500
So, uh, if this isn't serena, leave a message. Thank you.

521
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,320
Um, okay, that was the worst message I have ever heard...

522
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,230
Or the best.

523
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,880
Um, I was just calling to thank you for the ring,

524
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:24,060
But somehow I am finding myself

525
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,880
Wanting to give you another chance.

526
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,010
Hello?

527
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,560
Hello?

528
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,440
Are you calling for aaron?

529
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,020
Yeah. Hi. Who's this?

530
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,810
Tamara. Aaron's in the bathroom.

531
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,380
Do you wanna wait, or--

532
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:40,140
No! Uh, no, no. Just-- just tell him, um...

533
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,570
No, just--don't-- don't tell him anything.

534
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,710
I'm sorry.

535
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,520
Cecil, you got me again.

536
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,550
Nate, where are you going?

537
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,270
Jenny, I'm sorry. I gotta go home.

538
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,510
Your brother's here, and he knows. Wait. What?

539
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,080
Yeah, he saw us kissing on "gossip girl."

540
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,350
He's here with your dad. My--no, my dad's here?

541
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,480
Jenny, come on. The models are ready, and we gotta go.

542
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,140
No, no, no. My dad and my brother are here. Good.

543
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,230
So they can see how amazing you are with their own eyes

544
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,970
Instead of reading it in the papers tomorrow.

545
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,130
I mean, it's not like he's going to kill you twice. Okay.

546
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,160
Wait. Please. Nate, please, don't go.

547
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:18,160
I really need you here. Please.

548
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,740
Good evening. May I have your attention, please?

549
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,240
Thank you.

550
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,660
As head of the new york philanthropic society,

551
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,700
Presenting this award is my favorite duty.

552
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:44,620
Please join me in congratulating lily and bart bass.

553
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,060
Did you find her? No.

554
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,910
Lily and bart bass have funded the construction of clinics

555
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,680
And hospitals in equatorial guinea,

556
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,690
Sri lanka--

557
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,320
My apologies. There seems to be

558
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,450
Some sort of technical difficulty.

559
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,890
It looks great.

560
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,000
Thank you!

561
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,590
Oh, my god. Vanessa!

562
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,800
Vanessa, wait!

563
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,610
Here, here, here, jenny, jenny. Stop. No, just--

564
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,740
It's not your place, okay? No, I have to say something.

565
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:08,020
No, no. Stop. I shouldn't have done that. I'sorry.

566
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,560
Jenny. Vanessa!

567
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,410
Looks like it's bros before hos for little j.

568
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,160
Who knew that when her loyalty kicked in,

569
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,860
Nate would be kicked out?

570
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:27,810
J humphrey designs! Backers are welcome--whoa.

571
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,570
Get your groping hands off of me, creep.

572
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,040
I cannot believe your sister.

573
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,600
She's taken it to a whole other level.

574
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,600
Yeah, yeah, she has.

575
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,000
She's gotta be around here somewhere.

576
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,720
I'll check the lobby.

577
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,420
You might be upset, but the truth is,

578
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,040
This wasn't how you wanted to lose your virginity.

579
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:52,740
And which venue would you suggest, perhaps?

580
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,890
Chuck, I know it wasn't easy

581
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,620
Getting "gossip girl" to post that bogus report.

582
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,310
Thank you.

583
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,070
For you, anytime.

584
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,250
I think your little virgin's making a break for it. Ugh!

585
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,110
Emma. Emma! Wait.

586
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,440
Aren't you done? You won--

587
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,720
You, muffy, my mom. I'm the only loser.

588
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,490
You still don't get it.

589
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,270
Having sex for the first time shouldn't be

590
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,480
Part of a competition to beat muffy the lacross-titute.

591
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,900
It should be with someone you love.

592
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,800
Was your first time with someone you love?

593
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,920
Yes. It was.

594
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,270
And honestly...

595
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:44,170
There are better ways of getting your mother's attention.

596
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,420
I told you, this is about muffy. Please.

597
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,040
I wrote the book on distracted, self-centered mothers.

598
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,490
My mom has never met a single one of my teachers.

599
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,000
She regularly forgets my birthday,

600
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,300
And she only comments on my appearance

601
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,440
When she has something to criticize.

602
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,050
But you're perfect.

603
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,620
True, and that's why I finally realized

604
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,330
It wasn't about me...

605
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,780
The same way it's not about you.

606
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,890
My mom always says when we come to the city,

607
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,770
We're gonna hang out and do mother-daughter things.

608
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,170
It never happens.

609
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,330
So tell her that.

610
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:26,730
And... Can you try to avoid the serges of the world?

611
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,300
Thanks, by the way.

612
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,890
That guy was pretty gross.

613
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:36,990
Uh... Hello?

614
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:41,440
Hey, jordan. Uh, no, no. No, no, it's not too late.

615
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:47,750
Uh, yeah. I-i saw that. The three professors. That's...

616
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,590
No, i-i know what anemic means.

617
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,440
Uh, all right, well, thank you. Thank you for trying.

618
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:57,200
I appreciate it. Okay.

619
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,140
Is everything okay?

620
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,910
Um... No. No, not really.

621
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,470
No, don't-- don't worry about jenny.

622
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,420
She'll probably get in some trouble

623
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,970
For disrupting the event, but honestly,

624
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,140
I think everyone in there was kind of

625
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,340
Relieved. No, I know. Jenny will be fine

626
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,980
Jenny will be great, because jenny always does

627
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,800
What she has to do to get what she wants.

628
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,500
I don't follow.

629
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,980
Tonight my sister alienated everyone in her life.

630
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,250
But tomorrow she's gonna be in "the new york times."

631
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,810
I just can't help but wonder

632
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,580
If she's the one with all the guts in the family.

633
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,940
Hey, where is this coming from?

634
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,390
Nowhere. Nowhere. I'm sorry.

635
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,100
The humphreys already spoiled your mom's night.

636
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,240
I don't wanna spoil yours, too.

637
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,980
No, I don't care about this night. I care about you.

638
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,670
Tell me what's wrong.

639
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:53,790
Uh... I'm not gonna get into yale

640
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,680
Or probably any other school with a decent writing program.

641
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:00,410
No, dan, that is not true. No. I gotta go find my dad.

642
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,440
Thank you.

643
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,790
Good night.

644
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,380
Do you realize what time it is?

645
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,370
And look at that dress.

646
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,440
You expect me to believe you went to the movies in that?

647
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:24,340
Mom, please don't. This isn't her fault. Bed now.

648
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,820
Bed!

649
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:32,120
Mrs. Boardman, before you say anything you'll regret--

650
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,060
What was your plan-- take my daughter clubbing

651
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,830
And hope she'd plead your case to the dean?

652
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,150
I have some bad news for you, miss waldorf.

653
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,090
From what I've seen, you're not yale material.

654
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,030
Oh, you haven't seen anything yet.

655
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,030
Tell me, did you have a nice time

656
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,160
With your bryn mawr friends? What is that supposed to mean?

657
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,610
Here. Let me lend you my phone.

658
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,190
You'll be needing it to make a call to

659
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,750
New haven. Mom, this isn't blair's fault

660
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,470
I told you to go to bed. Blair was only trying to help me.

661
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,070
You're lecturing me?

662
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,420
No wonder I don't want to spend time with you. Bed! Right now!

663
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,340
You were saying?

664
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,670
Just...

665
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,770
Your daughter is a great girl.

666
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,490
You should pay more attention to her.

667
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,050
Soon it'll be too late.

668
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,530
Excuse me, ma'am?

669
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,020
Um, did you see a girl come out?

670
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,570
She had a blue shirt and dark, curly hair?

671
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,080
Jenny. Dad? Dad, let go of me.

672
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,640
Let go of me, dad. I'm trying to find

673
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,280
Vanessa. I hope you're proud of yourself

674
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,980
You know what? I am.

675
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,280
Because honestly, I achieved everything that I wanted.

676
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,120
Jenny, you can't just go through life

677
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:56,020
Not caring about who you hurt. Dad,

678
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,630
I already have 32 missed calls on my phone, okay

679
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,120
And those people aren't calling to tell me how mad they are

680
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,280
That I ruined their party. They're calling to tell me

681
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,880
That they like my designs, and they want to

682
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,190
Meet me. Well, those people are not your father

683
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,380
And speaking for him, I have never been more disappointed.

684
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,670
Hi. Hi there. I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

685
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,200
Jenny, I think you owe lily an apology. No, really.

686
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:20,230
No, no, no. He's right. Lily, I'm--i'm really sorry.

687
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,060
Well, honestly, it wasn't the evening I expected,

688
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,380
But it was amazing.

689
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,360
The whole thing was inspired.

690
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,830
Okay, I'm just gonna wait over here for a moment.

691
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,920
If you think you're getting away with this tonight,

692
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:38,740
You are dead wrong. It's too late. It's done.

693
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,140
Yeah, you're right.

694
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,300
Officer, if you're looking for the person responsible

695
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,650
For tonight, this is her. Dad!

696
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:50,230
Rufus. You can't be serious.

697
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,920
You're giving me no choice.

698
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,860
It's her number all over the polaroids.

699
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,570
Miss, I'm gonna have to take you to the station.

700
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,350
We'll call your parents from there.

701
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,560
He is my parent-- the one getting me arrested!

702
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:08,190
Officer, my name is lily bass, and I was the one

703
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,730
Being honored this evening, and my husband

704
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:13,270
Also owns this hotel, and we won't be pressing any charges.

705
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,070
Makes my job easier.

706
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,660
Lily, this is none of your business.

707
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:23,940
I am saving you from making a terrible mistake.

708
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,040
You know what?

709
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,990
You guys figure it out.

710
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,700
I'm going home.

711
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,300
Poor jenny--all that glamour almost led to the slammer.

712
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,480
But what will the morning bring?

713
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,970
Figured you'd be back at the family manor.

714
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,830
Is this the new minimalism?

715
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,160
What the hell is going on?

716
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,960
What do you think? I told you we were in trouble.

717
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,770
You didn't tell me it was this bad.

718
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,080
Then again, if it drove you to brooklyn,

719
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,420
I guess I should have known.

720
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,460
Brooklyn's over. I'm going to stay with my mom

721
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,850
Don't be so dramatic. You're coming with me.

722
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,680
No. I'm not.

723
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,310
B., it's time to get up.

724
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,180
There are other schools besides yale--like princeton.

725
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:20,590
Princeton is a trade school. There's only yale.

726
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,150
Well, I'm proud of you for not succumbing

727
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,100
To your baser instincts.

728
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,100
Hey, even though you might not get into yale,

729
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,010
At least this way you won't go to hell.

730
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,540
Blair waldorf's phone.

731
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,440
Y-yes, dean berube. She--she's right here.

732
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,860
What? No! Yes.

733
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,310
Dean berube. What a surprise.

734
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,370
Miss van der woodsen? You have a visitor.

735
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,880
Yes.

736
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,970
So, uh, I was thinking you, me, assorted breakfast pastries.

737
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,030
How many pastries exactly?

738
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,060
Is it just you and me, or is the entire harem

739
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:06,550
Coming along? Yeah, I want to explain yesterday

740
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,360
Look, aaron, the rings were sweet,

741
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,130
But I thought about it,

742
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,790
And I don't really want to date someone who has a posse.

743
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,580
A posse? Well, in our last two encounters,

744
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:19,280
You've been with two different girls. Well, one--one was a friend.

745
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,670
So you've said.

746
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,760
And the other one was...

747
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,650
You know what?

748
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,550
No, i-i could explain who tamara is

749
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,570
And why she was at my apartment last night.

750
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,560
The fact is, either you feel something here or you don't.

751
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:37,960
If you want an excuse not to give this a shot, that's fine.

752
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,610
But ever since you walked into the gallery last week,

753
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,680
I haven't been able to stop thinking about you.

754
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:47,210
I even dug up my old camp stuff. So did i.

755
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,800
Is it too weird to think that maybe fate brought us

756
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,100
Back together again?

757
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,390
Yes...

758
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,880
But romantic, too.

759
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,120
Hey, you know what? Forget breakfast.

760
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,020
I've waited nine years. I think that merits dinner.

761
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:06,000
You didn't eat that ring, did you? No, not yet.

762
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,130
Good. It's nine years old.

763
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,150
Wait. You kept yours?

764
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,730
I'll see you tonight.

765
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,020
Oh, my god. Emma told the dean that I'm the one person

766
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,450
Living or dead that she'd most like to have dinner with.

767
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,600
Oh, b.! And he said that yale

768
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:27,930
Could really use a girl like blair waldorf. Oh, b., I'm so happy for you.

769
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,790
Hey, I was just about to we you.

770
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,700
Your, uh, sister stomped out of here

771
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,330
At about 6:00 this morning, so it's just the 2 of us.

772
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,740
Did you sleep in that last night?

773
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,430
I didn't sleep, actually. I was up all nigh

774
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,950
Finishing this story for noah shapiro.

775
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:50,960
The guy from "the paris review"? Which story? The one about chuck bass.

776
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,140
You said you couldn't write that story.

777
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,450
No, I could always write it. I chose not to.

778
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,490
Dan, just because jenny-- dad, look,

779
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,220
The morning after my little sister stage

780
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,470
A fashion show that all of new york city

781
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,150
Will be talking about is not the time

782
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,820
For the "slow and steady" speech.

783
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,270
All right, I'm sorry. I-i tried it your way.

784
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,780
I wish I could get the two of you to understand

785
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:17,540
That success, people praising you, it goes away.

786
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,360
And when that day comes,

787
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,630
If you don't like who you are, you're done.

788
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,840
Well, I guess that's a chance I'm willing to take.

789
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,640
Dan, please. I have to worry about you now?

790
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,370
It's gonna be all I can do to try and reach jenny.

791
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,730
It's a little late for that, dad.

792
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,520
I-i think you need to look in her room.

793
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,680
S. And b. Are headed for yale.

794
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:52,780
Nate's headed out of town, and dan's headed for trouble.

795
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,960
As for little sister jenny,

796
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,750
She's nowhere to be seen.

797
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:02,060
X.O.X.O., gossip girl.
