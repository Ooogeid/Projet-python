1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,680
Gossip Girl here... 
your one and only source

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,530
into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,220
How have you never
heard of Olivia Burke?

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,200
You know, that "Endless Knights" series

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,172
has made, like, a billion dollars.

6
00:00:10,173 --> 00:00:12,550
I have been dreaming of coming to NYU

7
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,960
- and just being a normal student. 
- This night is finally over,

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,520
and as far as I'm concerned, so are we.

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,840
- Where's your better half? 
- I don't know. I was looking for her.

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,220
- Well, I can leave. 
- It's okay. Stay.

11
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,150
- I'm not sick. 
- Then what are you doing home so early?

12
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,030
Did something happen? 
- Ask Jenny.

13
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,270
I'm still your friend.
I'm still your sister.

14
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,280
I just can't let the words get confused.

15
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,140
I want nothing to do
with you in either world.

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,600
And who am I?

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,300
That's a secret I'll never tell.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,820
You know you love me.

19
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,740
X.O.X.O., Gossip Girl.

20
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,070
Have you been so busy
that you've forgotten

21
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,300
what time of year it is?
Let me give you a hint... 

22
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,430
couture, quadrilles and
cutthroat competition.

23
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,460
That's right.

24
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,640
- It's time for cotillion. 
- This guy's a foot shorter than me.

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,500
Here's one that's 6'2".

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,070
Yeah, and he goes to York.

27
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,110
That's practically public school.

28
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,480
Have I not impressed on you three

29
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,170
how important tomorrow night is?

30
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,370
It's my debut in society.
I have to be perfect,

31
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,910
and that means having
the perfect escort.

32
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,030
- I told you who I wanted. 
- We tried.

33
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,830
Well, try harder.

34
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,850
Graham Collins is the hottest guy

35
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:25,920
on the upper east side.

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,580
There's like this bubble
Of perfection around him

37
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,500
- that we can't penetrate. 
- Well, you better figure out a way.

38
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,720
Otherwise, tomorrow night I'm
taking one of your escorts.

39
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,660
Just like the mob, 
New York prep schools

40
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,020
have their own five families,

41
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,090
you may be the John Gotti
of Constance, little J.,

42
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,120
but that doesn't mean

43
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,210
you'll ever be part of this Cosa Nostra.

44
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,670
Oh, my God. Everyone's here.

45
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,660
Come on. Let's go say Hi.

46
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,240
I have a surprise for you.

47
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,210
- In that case, Why are you still dressed? 
- That was yesterday.

48
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,540
Today we're seeing the Kandinsky Exhibit

49
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,790
and having dinner at E.A.T.

50
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,690
Well, I'd love to, but
I think you've forgotten

51
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,770
today's Nate's move-in
day. We're celebrating

52
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,330
with a lost weekend. 
- I never signed off on a lost weekend.

53
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,690
Do you really think I
wanna spend my weekend

54
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,030
watching women with tramp stamps
work out their Daddy issues?

55
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,900
It's for Nate. Anyway,
You'll be busy with cotillion.

56
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,260
Aren't you supposed to be a mentor?

57
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,070
And risk running into
Serena? No, thank you.

58
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,700
Though it does kill me to imagine

59
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,410
those poor girls stumbling
along without my guidance.

60
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,980
Isn't it about time
you and Serena made up?

61
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,700
You love cotillion. You
should be doing it together.

62
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,260
Don't the festivities begin tonight?

63
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,320
There's a dinner at
the Van der Woodsens'

64
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,530
for debs and mentors.

65
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,390
But knowing Serena,
She'll probably flake.

66
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,940
Or she'll be waiting for you,
apology in hand, and really,

67
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,020
a debutante ball without Blair Waldorf

68
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,880
is like a Tour de France
without Lance Armstrong.

69
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,640
I resent the comparison
to that man-whore.

70
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,410
Though your other point is well taken.

71
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,750
I suppose the charitable
thing would be to give Serena

72
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,090
the opportunity to beg for forgiveness.

73
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,950
Don't get too lost, Bass.

74
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,560
A lot of my responsibilities
from K.C.'s office

75
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,110
would translate to this
job... event planning,

76
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,620
writing press releases.

77
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,610
Okay.

78
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,100
"Okay" as in I have the job "Okay"?

79
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,030
What?

80
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,900
- Just like that? 
- You make a good case.

81
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,000
Also, I remember our summer relay races

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,150
at Nate's Hamptons house.

83
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,523
Underneath that smile
is a heart of a killer.

84
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:48,660
Me? Need I remind you

85
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,650
of the potato sack
race incident of 1998?

86
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,580
I still have evidence of
your unsportsmanlike behavior.

87
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,570
Although given our new circumstances,

88
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,120
I maybe have to forgive you now.

89
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,590
Um... I should, uh,
I should probably go.

90
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,020
I, uh, I'm a mentor
at cotillion this year,

91
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,230
and my mom asked me to
host a dinner at our house.

92
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,700
Of course. Well, we're
here all day every day.

93
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,370
But I'll see you Monday.

94
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,100
Great.

95
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,630
Thank you so much for asking
me to come in and interview.

96
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,280
Our talk on election night
really meant a lot to me.

97
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,590
Me, too.

98
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,800
I didn't realize We were hiring.

99
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,300
Could always use another person, right?

100
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,430
Do you think you can get brain damage

101
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,340
- from learning too much too fast? 
- No.

102
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,070
You're the one who wanted
the real college experience,

103
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,420
- cramming for exams. 
- I know.

104
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,660
Oh, my God. No way!

105
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,910
- Please tell me that Guinevere
will use the unholy grail

106
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,640
to free Lancelot from Arthur's eternal torture. 
- "Endless Knights 4"?

107
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,990
Why didn't you tell me?

108
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,150
Because it's not happening.

109
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,940
Those rumors have been
going around forever.

110
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,720
But Warner Brothers
sent out a press release.

111
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,220
- I'll never trust Harry Knowles again. 
- Sorry, guys.

112
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,830
It's not happening.

113
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,210
If it were true, I'd have
about a hundred phone calls

114
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,110
about it by now.

115
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,040
Crap.

116
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,830
I'll be right back.

117
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,250
I'm sure it's not true.

118
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,100
Though it'd be kinda awesome.

119
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,760
All right, debs, enough socializing.

120
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,020
Uh, we have a lot to get through,

121
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,650
so if you'll please find your escorts

122
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,450
- and take your places... 
- Um, Lily,

123
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,210
um, as you know, I don't
have my escort situation

124
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,940
fully ironed out yet, so... 

125
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,620
Oh, that's okay. Um, Maximillian here

126
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,330
will, um, dance with you today.

127
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,170
He is divine. I think it'll be great

128
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,290
to have some one-on-one
tutoring because I know

129
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,990
you have some catching up to do.

130
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,460
Ca-catching up? I, uh, this
was the first rehearsal.

131
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,550
I know, but, um, the other girls

132
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,400
have been taking ballroom for years,

133
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,490
so you will be great.

134
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,060
You have your father's natural rhythm.

135
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,270
Um, I'm just gonna get a drink of water.

136
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,120
Okay.

137
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,340
Hey, Jenny.

138
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,520
Hey, Jenny.

139
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,390
Hi. Uh, you're Kira, right?
I'm Eric Van der Woodsen.

140
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,380
Our mothers arranged
for me to be your escort.

141
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,900
Oh, right. So humiliating
I couldn't get my own date,

142
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,700
- but thank you. 
- Well, it'll be fun.

143
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,086
You're Jenny Humphrey's
brother, aren't you?

144
00:06:41,087 --> 00:06:42,660
That's my new claim to fame.

145
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,310
Those girls who hang out
with her are so lucky.

146
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,020
- Who's her escort? 
- Well, she's obsessed with getting Graham Collins.

147
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,020
Graham lives in my building.
We've been neighbors forever.

148
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,900
- I could... 
- Not breathe a word.

149
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,100
I know Graham, too. I went
to camp Suisse with him.

150
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,590
- I could probably introduce them myself. 
- So why don't you?

151
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,830
Because, uh, Jenny hates it
when other people get involved

152
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,960
in her personal life. I would
definitely stay out if it

153
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
- if I were you. 
- Really?

154
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,948
- Absolutely. So you ready to dance? 
- Sure.

155
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:10,770
Just let me get my shoes.

156
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,890
- All right. 
- Okay, ladies, find your escort.

157
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,190
I want to make her remember
why she came to college... 

158
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,990
The... the part that
doesn't involve the library

159
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,900
or waking up with a
textbook stuck to your face.

160
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,740
I think if we can do that,
then we got a fighting chance

161
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,094
at keeping her here.

162
00:07:30,095 --> 00:07:34,090
You mean like "the 15 things
every college student must do

163
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,140
before graduating"?

164
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,970
Uh, yeah, exactly that. Uh... 

165
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,000
Yeah. No, we haven't cheered
ourselves hoarse at a sporting event.

166
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,660
We haven't gotten sick after a
beer pong tournament at bar None.

167
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,870
We haven't had sex with someone
We don't want to see again.

168
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,900
- Well, no, actually, I... I did that one with Georgina. 
- True.

169
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,100
You know, but we haven't
done any of this... 

170
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,140
Falafel at Mamoun's, Frat party crawl.

171
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,140
It's for real this time.
My parents, manager,

172
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,630
three of my agents... Are all
flying out from L.A. on Monday

173
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,230
to convince me to do it.

174
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,450
It's like "the sopranos,"
but with bagels.

175
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,930
- Hadn't they all agreed to give you this year for college? 
- Well, that's what I said,

176
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,510
but it doesn't really matter.
I'm pretty sure they're

177
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,810
on the phone with the dean right now,

178
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,310
getting him to let me
finish classes from location.

179
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,100
I mean, how do I fight that?

180
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,360
By telling them that college is
about a lot more than just classes.

181
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,930
- You don't have beer pong on location. 
- What?

182
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,360
We'll explain on the way.

183
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,740
But your college life begins now.

184
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,100
You don't know the dances.

185
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,010
No, I do. I... 

186
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,180
I... You'd think that it would be enough

187
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,660
to just be the queen
of Constance, but, no,

188
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,540
then you have to be the queen
Of the entire upper east side,

189
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,010
which means having the
perfect escort and... 

190
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,360
I'm just gonna make a complete
fool out of myself, aren't I?

191
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,810
Probably.

192
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,350
You know, I... I really thought

193
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,630
that if I made the perfect debut,

194
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,940
people would finally forget
that I'm just a Brooklyn nobody.

195
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,360
It helps If you count out loud.

196
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,110
Eric, you don't have to be nice to me.

197
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,340
I've been so awful to you and Jonathan.

198
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,880
It's true. But I'm a
better person than you are.

199
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,800
That's also true.

200
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,350
Come here.

201
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,170
- There's only one official dance. You can learn that easy. 
- Eric... 

202
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,790
Stop complaining. Start counting. Ready?

203
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,440
One, two, three, four, out.
One, two, three, back in.

204
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,100
You know, I wish that you
could just be my escort.

205
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,930
- At least then I'd have fun. 
- I'm gonna turn you.

206
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,700
- Okay. 
- Um... 

207
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,330
Well... 

208
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,020
What about Jonathan?

209
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,600
He's not Graham Collins,
but he is a Whitney.

210
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,320
Debuting with Gertrude
Whitney's great grandson

211
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,700
will count for a lot
with the deb ball crowd.

212
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,130
Walk.

213
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,270
Well, do you think he'd even go with me?

214
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,690
Well, he will once I talk to him.

215
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,540
Well, then I'll have my
minions call off the search.

216
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,290
Thank you.

217
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,450
In the complicated
world of debutante balls,

218
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,430
one must choose her
dance partner wisely.

219
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,210
You never know when a hand on the hip

220
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,210
can lead to a knife in the back.

221
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,750
Excuse me, please.

222
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:44,030
- Blair. 
- Serena. Anything you want to say to me?

223
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,370
Welcome.

224
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,670
I see. That's it?

225
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,750
Uh, well, there's a list
of debs and their mentors

226
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,620
on the coffee table.

227
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,940
You can find out who
Lily assigned you to.

228
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,100
My deb's right here, right, Jenny?

229
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,710
Uh, yeah, Serena's my mentor. Why?

230
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,690
Oh, of course, if that's what
you want. It's just a shame.

231
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,790
You know how I feel
about your potential.

232
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,696
Blair, are we really
doing this right now?

233
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:07,240
I gave you a chance to apologize.

234
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,000
- How about you apologize? 
- I'm here, aren't I?

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,390
Okay, look, I have
enough of my own problems,

236
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,790
so I'm not gonna let you guys
make me a pawn in your war.

237
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,470
War? What? Of course not.

238
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,730
Who's your escort?

239
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,650
Jonathan Whitney.

240
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,850
Your stepbrother's boyfriend.

241
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,580
Do you remember who my escort was?

242
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,270
Nate.

243
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,220
Jenny, when you descend
those stairs tomorrow night,

244
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,280
everyone there will judge
you, based on that moment,

245
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,120
for the rest of your life.

246
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,680
This is not like your wedding day.

247
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,490
Cotillion only happens once.
Now you already have one strike

248
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,900
against you because of the
whole Brooklyn misfortune

249
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,490
and add a "b+" escort
and top it off with

250
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,320
a mentor who's known
more for her mug shots

251
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,893
and topless photos in Ibiza
than her social graces?

252
00:11:48,894 --> 00:11:50,180
Okay, you're right, Jenny.

253
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,250
You know what? You shouldn't
be caught between Blair and me.

254
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,070
It's not fair to you on your big night.

255
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,560
- She can be your mentor. It's fine. 
- How selfless.

256
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,800
Actually, I'm working for
congressman Tripp Van der Bilt,

257
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,660
and I should get back to
that. But you have fun tonight.

258
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,640
These are probably the
last people in New York

259
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,930
who still think you matter.

260
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,150
May I take your coats?

261
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,870
No. I'm sorry. I don't want to.

262
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,170
Jenny feels bad about what happened.

263
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,170
Great. She should feel bad.

264
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,383
That doesn't mean I have to
be her escort to cotillion.

265
00:12:24,384 --> 00:12:25,510
She's at the tipping point.

266
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,920
She's not Darth Vader yet.
She could still stay Anakin.

267
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,890
We have to stop her before we
truly lose her to the dark side.

268
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,440
Fine. But she'd better
really want to do this.

269
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,760
She does. I promise.

270
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,570
Hey. I didn't think you
were coming in till Monday.

271
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,520
Well, my night suddenly opened up,

272
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,270
and I know you said you work late,

273
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:00,720
- so I thought You might be hungry. 
- Thanks. I'm starving.

274
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,070
But are you sure? I
mean, it's Friday night.

275
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:07,420
I'll take real politics over
the ones at cotillion any night.

276
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,190
Joe Wilson has nothing on Blair Waldorf.

277
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,770
Okay.

278
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,430
So what... What is all this?

279
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,350
Uh, 1 speech, 15 drafts.

280
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:20,660
Is there anything your new media
relations fact can do to help?

281
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:25,370
Well, the speech is
about school lunches,

282
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,400
teacher salaries and term limits.

283
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,960
That's all?

284
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,110
Here. Let me see.

285
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,620
Oh, watch out for
your tie. There you go.

286
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,320
Congressman?

287
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,130
I'll come back.

288
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,000
Actually... You know,
I have to finish this.

289
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,860
You... You don't want
to run anything by me?

290
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,220
Why don't you go home?

291
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,600
Tomorrow you can meet
Brian. You'll report to him.

292
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,620
Okay.

293
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,750
Thanks for the food.

294
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,470
Yeah.

295
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,890
Hi.

296
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,980
I'm Kira. I go to Constance with you.

297
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,020
- Yeah, sure, I've seen you around. 
- You have?

298
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,900
That's awesome.

299
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,230
Blair Waldorf's your mentor?

300
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,960
Who needs Graham Collins
when you have her?

301
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,650
What do you know about Graham?

302
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,930
When Eric told me you
wanted to go with him,

303
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,080
I called and asked him, and
he was totally up for it.

304
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,520
He told me he texted you, but you said

305
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,170
- you already had an escort. 
- What? When?

306
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:44,020
- Today. Right after you left rehearsal. 
- Oh, my God.

307
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,490
Did you text Graham Collins
that I didn't want him

308
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,324
to be my escort?

309
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:51,090
I knew that if you had the
chance to go with Graham,

310
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,620
- you'd make the wrong choice. 
- That wasn't your decision to make.

311
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,140
- I don't believe this. 
- Jonathan.

312
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,580
Mentee and mentee's
stepbrother/ Escort's boyfriend,

313
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,580
Can you please stop embarrassing
Me? People are staring.

314
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,710
- Eric tried to sabotage me. 
- I was trying to save you.

315
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,450
I don't know why everybody
loves Graham so much.

316
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,376
I went to camp with the guy,
and he's a... He's a creep.

317
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,900
What? You knew him this whole time?

318
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,920
I had a plan from the beginning.
And I should have stuck to it.

319
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,570
I'm going to cotillion
with Graham Collins.

320
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,530
I'll allow it. Sorry, Eric.

321
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,900
Actually, Blair, since
I'm queen of Constance

322
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,940
and Graham Collins
wants to be my escort,

323
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,910
I don't think I need
you as my mentor anymore.

324
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,510
Jenny, you're lucky to
have me. Don't push it.

325
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,360
Your era's over.

326
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,410
- And so is that headband. 
- So should I call Graham?

327
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,950
Now that I know he wants to go with me,

328
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,300
- I think I'll call him
myself.  - Uh-oh, little J.

329
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:51,360
- You've stepped on Eric's toes one too many times. 
- Whoa.

330
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,060
- She can't get away with this. 
- She won't.

331
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,470
Now he's found a new partner.

332
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:00,320
Who knows what could happen
when these two start to tango?

333
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:15,320
Morning. Oh. I see the
moving in went well.

334
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,430
Hey, Blair.

335
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,670
- Blair. 
- Excuse the mess. How was dinner?

336
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,668
Did you and Serena work things out?

337
00:16:21,669 --> 00:16:24,110
Oh, no. She took off
immediately. Thank God.

338
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,240
Then I had to relieve
her of her mentor duties.

339
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,460
Is that poll artist wearing
my Agent Provocateur corset?

340
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,690
Just make sure she's
careful undoing the eyehooks.

341
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:36,520
They pinch. I just came to
grab a dress for tonight.

342
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,510
The last time I saw Blair
that freakishly calm... 

343
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,160
Was when Serena left
for boarding school.

344
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,140
And you know as well as
I do, the calm won't last.

345
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,370
And when it breaks,

346
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,650
there are going to be pieces
of Blair all over the wall.

347
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:57,010
And I really don't want
to clean up that mess.

348
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,700
What are she and Serena
fighting about this time?

349
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,580
Basically how each one loves the other

350
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,220
more than the other loves her.

351
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,380
Can you even fight about that?

352
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,640
You might want to ring housekeeping.

353
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,990
Chocolate leaves a stain.

354
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,700
Toodles.

355
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,840
Hey. I didn't realize you were here.

356
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,580
Yeah, I'm just about to take
off. I was leaving you a note

357
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,461
to check out this new press release.

358
00:17:30,462 --> 00:17:33,650
I'm sure it's fine. Just show
it to Brian when he gets back.

359
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,630
Okay.

360
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,130
Did I do something wrong?

361
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,630
No, I just... I don't have time to chat.

362
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,240
Um, I'm at work, Serena.

363
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,500
But you're... you're just acting like

364
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,210
- you don't really want me here or something. 
- That's not it.

365
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:54,020
- Well, what then? 
- This was a huge mistake.

366
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,800
What was? Hiring me? Tripp, I'm sorry,

367
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,260
But you're... you're
the one who asked me

368
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,220
to come in for the interview.
If you didn't want me

369
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,140
- working here, then why would you do that? 
- I did want you here.

370
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:08,300
I find you smart and charming... 

371
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,450
And I wanted to help you
out. But having you here?

372
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,160
I didn't realize how
much it would affect me.

373
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,090
Say something.

374
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,880
Um... 

375
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,810
You know what? Don't worry about me.

376
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,310
It's not gonna be a
problem. I have to go.

377
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,740
- Serena, wait. 
- Please. It's... it's fine.

378
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,350
Excuse me.

379
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,810
I don't understand.

380
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,450
How can you make me queen?

381
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,970
Simple. To become queen,
you must take down the queen.

382
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,340
- But I want to be Jenny's friend. 
- Kira, let me tell you a story.

383
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,100
I used to have a friend like Jenny.

384
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,170
She was beautiful, fabulous... 

385
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,040
And she let me make all
these sacrifices for her.

386
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,420
And you know what I got back
in that investment? Zero.

387
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,870
Because girls like her run
emotional ponzi schemes.

388
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,480
- Serena will never like you the way you like her. 
- You mean Jenny.

389
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,170
Details. Now are you ready to be queen,

390
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,730
or do I need to find a new frog?

391
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,750
We hear Jenny Humphrey

392
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,910
has landed Graham Collins as her escort.

393
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,350
Better put on that lip gloss, ladies.

394
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,810
Look like you'll be kissing
Jenny Humphrey's ring

395
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,650
by the end of the night.

396
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,280
Goodbye, Jenny from Brooklyn.

397
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,060
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

398
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,040
Whoo!

399
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,400
- On three. One, two, three! 
- Whoo!

400
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,900
Oh, God.

401
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,100
- Mmm. 
- Ugh.

402
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,280
Ooh! Mm!

403
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,830
This is even more amazing
than dancing in the fountain.

404
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,890
- Mm, mm, mm, mm. 
- I'll be right back.

405
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,240
Um, don't do any mind-altering
substances without me.

406
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,800
Okay. All right.

407
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,330
- You know, I think this is gonna work. 
- Really?

408
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,362
It's gonna... yeah, she's gonna... what?

409
00:21:01,363 --> 00:21:03,090
I knew you were trouble, Humphrey.

410
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,650
You're trying to get Olivia to abandon

411
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,045
her calling as Queen of the Undead.

412
00:21:06,046 --> 00:21:08,000
You don't think Morgana
could take over Camelot?

413
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,287
- Vanessa, d... 
- Sorry.

414
00:21:09,288 --> 00:21:12,230
But Lancelot wouldn't
let that happen, would he?

415
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,530
If the realm falls into the wrong hands,

416
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,130
it's on your head.

417
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,560
He means you can kiss your
credit rating good-bye.

418
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,280
- Nice v-neck.
- Thank you for coming.

419
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,030
- That's... those are your people. 
- Shut up.

420
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,090
Who's ready for a keg stand?

421
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,590
I have to take the movie.

422
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,330
Even I have to admit... 

423
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,190
This may just be my makeover swan song.

424
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,250
And not to take anything
away from your moment,

425
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,300
but I'm still not sure
anyone's going to think

426
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,624
I'm better than Jenny.

427
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,100
They will when they
see who your escort is.

428
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:54,800
But I'm going with Eric. I
mean, he's nice and all, but... 

429
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,030
- Eric's not your escort anymore. 
- Then who is?

430
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,720
- You know Graham Collins, right? 
- Graham?

431
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,310
Spin your partner round and round.

432
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,370
Look like little J is going down.

433
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,410
You know, you don't have to
do this if you don't want to.

434
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,750
Oh, well, it's a little late for
that. You look beautiful, Jenny.

435
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,290
I'm just saying, I'll always love you,

436
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:49,850
- with or without society's approval. 
- Thanks, dad, but honestly,

437
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,970
I can't wait to walk down those steps.

438
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,010
So I'll see you soon.

439
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:03,130
- Hey, Jenny. Have you seen Blair? 
- Um, no, not yet, fortunately.

440
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,150
I'm looking for my
escort, Graham Collins.

441
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:09,540
He's, uh, sort of this
year's, I guess, you.

442
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,880
I'll take that as a compliment.
Hey, have fun tonight.

443
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,510
Thanks. I plan to.

444
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,730
Always lead with the right.

445
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,200
And no claw hands. Relaxed fingers.

446
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,560
Oh, look.

447
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,860
A lost boy from lost weekend.

448
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,110
Chuck actually sent me to find you.

449
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:32,740
He has a surprise in the
private lounge upstairs.

450
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,570
Go. We've got it under control.

451
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,230
Okay.

452
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,730
But I'm just curious.
You never told me... 

453
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,870
how exactly did you get
Graham to ditch Jenny for Kira?

454
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,270
I told Graham that what
happens at Camp Suisse

455
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,100
doesn't stay at Camp Suisse.

456
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,760
Little Van Der Woodsen,

457
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,370
I'm impressed with your natural talents.

458
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,000
And we were good long distance,

459
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,860
You know, with your Sushi pun
text flirting and all that.

460
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,344
I know. It's much easier
to be pissy on ichat.

461
00:24:09,345 --> 00:24:10,910
I'm gonna be back next year.

462
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,100
There's too many people
depending on me for this one.

463
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,060
I grew up on these sets.
This crew is like my family.

464
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,910
I never thought I'd be sad to
hear about "Endless Knights 4."

465
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,650
When do you have to go?

466
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,870
Well, fight choreography
starts right away,

467
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,800
so, you know, with the midterms over,

468
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,120
it makes sense for me to
leave for London next week.

469
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,600
- So much for the ultimate college experience. 
- What? No.

470
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,930
I have had the ultimate
experience, with you guys.

471
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:38,100
They say that the friends
you meet here last a lifetime.

472
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,020
Do you guys want to get out of here?

473
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,070
- Absolutely. 
- Yeah. Let's do it.

474
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,480
What are you doing here?

475
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,480
Waiting for you.

476
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,960
You sent me a text to meet you,

477
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,534
and then you keep me
waiting for half an hour?

478
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,550
I didn't text you. I lost my phone.

479
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:00,230
Nate told me to come meet... Chuck.

480
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,540
Right.

481
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:05,640
Going down.

482
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,560
Not without me.

483
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,450
Can you press the button, please?

484
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,570
I've pressed the button.

485
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,940
If you don't believe me,
you can press it yourself.

486
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,870
Great.

487
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,660
Hello? I'm trapped in the elevator

488
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,860
with someone who sucks all
the air out of the room.

489
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,460
Send help or I'll be dead within the hour.

490
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,760
Not until you two work things out.

491
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,270
Bass? Bass?

492
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,810
Th... this is a punishable offense,

493
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,600
and not the kind of punishment you like!

494
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,400
I'm only doing what you
refused to do yourself.

495
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,020
Chuck, this is not funny.
There's a single Malt

496
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,810
and some Laduree Macaroons
in the storage box,

497
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,840
plenty to sustain you until
you two figure things out.

498
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,230
So... 

499
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,470
What did my text supposedly say?

500
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:12,150
That you were sorry and you missed me.

501
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,970
Did you text me back?

502
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,770
Miss Jane Cordelia Trapp,

503
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:31,330
escorted by Mr. Theodore Davis III.

504
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,500
Miss Sawyer Harriett Bennett,

505
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,790
escorted by Mr. Evan Jameson Jr.

506
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,760
Miss Jennifer Tallulah Humphrey,

507
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,690
escorted by Mr. Graham Collins.

508
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,020
My apologies.

509
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,220
Miss Kira Abernathy,

510
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,850
escorted by Mr. Graham Collins.

511
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,840
Who's your escort, dear?

512
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,260
What just happened?

513
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,350
Um... 

514
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,400
Jenny Humphrey went to a ball.

515
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,210
I don't... I don't know.

516
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,180
Jenny Humphrey had a great fall,

517
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,410
and none of her minions,
mentors or friends

518
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:25,340
want to put Jenny together again.

519
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,740
- Jenny, my darling, what happened? 
- Are you all right?

520
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,836
Do you want to pick
someone else to walk with?

521
00:28:01,837 --> 00:28:04,290
It doesn't work that way,
dad. You only get one chance.

522
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,390
Have you seen Blair?

523
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,460
- Uh, no. Sorry. 
- I know she's behind this.

524
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,640
And it's all because I
didn't want her as my mentor.

525
00:28:10,641 --> 00:28:11,940
What if it's all for the best?

526
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,830
I mean, don't you think
that maybe being Queen

527
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,590
- isn't worth it? 
- You really don't understand. I was gonna walk

528
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:20,299
down those steps and finally
stop having to prove myself.

529
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,090
Let it go, Jenny. It's over.

530
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,920
That's what Blair thinks.

531
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,280
Hi. Are you still here?

532
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:48,280
You went looking for your father?

533
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,290
Yeah, and I... I found him, too,

534
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,570
but he didn't want to see me.

535
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,780
What?

536
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,850
Why didn't you say anything
while all of this was happening?

537
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,110
I guess I was ashamed.

538
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,340
Your dad adores you,

539
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,780
all your dads do.

540
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,840
And Rufus would do
anything for Dan and Jenny.

541
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,650
Even Nate... he may have to
go to prison to see his dad,

542
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,280
but the Captain would
never turn him away.

543
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,500
I'm even jealous of Nate's dad.

544
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,240
Not knowing you

545
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,000
is your father's loss.

546
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,730
Maybe, but I... 

547
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,990
I just can't seem to let it go.

548
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,620
I keep leaving him messages

549
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,770
and writing letters to addresses
I'm not even sure are his.

550
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,460
You miss him.

551
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,530
You're allowed.

552
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,570
I don't want to.

553
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:47,760
All I even remember of
him is him going on trips

554
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
and then coming back
and bringing me presents.

555
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,910
And then one day he didn't come back.

556
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,210
And now it's like

557
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,710
I... I can't seem to get
anything right anymore.

558
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,630
Between Carter and the paparazzi

559
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,330
and Brown and... 

560
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,370
Ohh.

561
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,050
And now Tripp.

562
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,500
Tripp Van Der Bilt?

563
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,800
Yeah, it... I guess I've... 
I've kind of had a crush on him.

564
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,220
But it was nothing. I
mean, he's... he's married,

565
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,910
and he's always treated me like a kid.

566
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:22,910
But now we work together, and tonight... 

567
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:23,670
Did something happen?

568
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:27,340
No. No, nothing. Your text saved me.

569
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:32,660
But now I don't know if I
can trust myself around him.

570
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,690
Then you can't see him again.

571
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:39,690
Carter was one thing, but
Tripp is a married congressman.

572
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,940
I know.

573
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,470
- Serena... 
- I know.

574
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,860
Promise me you won't see
him or speak to him again

575
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:49,780
- without coming to me first. 
- Okay. I promise.

576
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,620
Thank you, Blair.

577
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,150
If you two want to kiss,

578
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,260
it won't count as cheating.

579
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,440
Creepy, Chuck.

580
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:11,590
Okay, wait. So you guys used
a prefab college experience

581
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,330
- to get me to stay? 
- Oh, yeah.

582
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,850
Shamelessly plucked from the headlines.

583
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,450
Wait, how many did we
eventually get through?

584
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,470
I think we got, uh, what... 
let's see. There's the... 

585
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:22,590
beer boggle and fountain yoga

586
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:25,170
and, uh... 

587
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,970
You know, I think we
got a solid 14 out of 15.

588
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:31,070
So you can go back to London
with your head held high.

589
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,640
What?

590
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,240
I am not going with just one more to go.

591
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,250
Now come on. Let's... let's
do the last one.

592
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,490
Let's just do it right now.

593
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,380
- Mm.
- It can't be worse

594
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:46,420
- than the bathroom at Fat Black Pussycat's. 
- I wouldn't say worse.

595
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,800
Oh. Yeah.

596
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,930
That one.

597
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,380
- Have you ever, uh... 
- Have I? No. No.

598
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,190
No, never.

599
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:06,740
- Wait... no, never. Have you? 
- Once.

600
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,030
But it was in a movie,

601
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:11,930
- so that doesn't really count. 
- Not me. No.

602
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,340
Let's find Nate and Chuck
and congratulate them.

603
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,010
And then torture them.

604
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,850
May I have your attention, Please?

605
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,060
Due to extenuating circumstances

606
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:31,040
we have one last deputy to present

607
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,440
Miss Jennifer Tallulah Humphrey.

608
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,050
She's walking alone?

609
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,030
Nobody walks alone.

610
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:47,700
Escorted by Mr. Nathaniel Archibald.

611
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,970
A college guy?

612
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,610
Nate Archibald is... epic.

613
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,800
Well, we found Nate.

614
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,370
Oh, E, you tried to
play dirty at the dance.

615
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,500
but you should know

616
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,910
nobody puts Jenny in the corner,

617
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:24,700
and now she's having
the time of her life.

618
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:39,190
So thanks for saving me again.

619
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,890
You know how these girls are.

620
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:43,530
I'm glad it worked out.

621
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,810
Nate?

622
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,950
I gotta say, I didn't
see that one coming.

623
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:52,260
- Well, I learned from the best. 
- Good answer.

624
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,530
The other queens would
like to pay their respects.

625
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,850
You look beautiful,
Jenny. Enjoy your night.

626
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,380
Thank you.

627
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:03,490
So... now what? You wanna
get something to eat?

628
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:06,410
Yeah, but first I need to
stop by Tripp's office... 

629
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:10,850
- to hand in my resignation. It's just up the street. 
- That's my girl.

630
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,620
Thanks for coming.

631
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,600
You won't believe who
Jenny got to walk with her.

632
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,640
I read all about it On "Gossip Girl".

633
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,860
But I didn't come here because of Jenny.

634
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,840
Were you serious on your message?

635
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,070
Have you really been
scheming with Blair?

636
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,130
Uh, yeah, I... I know
it sounds crazy, but... 

637
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,530
So it's official... you've
sunk to Jenny's level.

638
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,400
I was doing it to help her.

639
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,920
Although it didn't exactly
turn out as I planned.

640
00:35:45,921 --> 00:35:47,000
Really? I'm shocked.

641
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,870
The point is, it doesn't
matter. She's not worth our time.

642
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,730
She's not the only one.

643
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,110
I don't want to do this anymore.

644
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,900
Well, we won't. Like I said,
I'm... I'm done with Jenny.

645
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,680
I'm not talking about Jenny.

646
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:08,010
Jonathan, come on.

647
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,940
I promise I'll never talk to her again.

648
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:13,650
It's not about Jenny. It's
about who you've become.

649
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:17,500
I liked you because you were
different from everyone else.

650
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,330
You were smart and
you knew who you were.

651
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,790
You didn't need to
prove anything to anyone.

652
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,610
And now?

653
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,420
I'm... 

654
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,200
I'm sorry, Eric, but it's over.

655
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,780
You were the one who said

656
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,210
to restrict our scheming to outsiders.

657
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,590
Desperate times, desperate measures.

658
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,350
And I'm willing to accept my punishment.

659
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,760
In fact, I left a few
props up in the lounge.

660
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,580
Sadly, your punishment is going
to be an evening without me.

661
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,970
I'm gonna spend it with my best friend.

662
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,990
Oh, and if you ever loan
out my lingerie again... 

663
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,190
Well... 

664
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,700
I just hope you like me in flannel.

665
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,610
Eric.

666
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,290
I thought maybe you bailed.

667
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,970
Did you see it? It was awesome.

668
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,440
I really showed Blair. She
even admitted it herself.

669
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,240
Yeah, you really showed her. Hey, look,

670
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,990
I'm sorry about Jonathan
becoming collateral damage.

671
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,210
But you understand,
right? I had no choice.

672
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,790
And you did lie to me.

673
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,910
Oh, a bunch of us are going
to Serafina. You wanna come?

674
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,810
Go celebrate with your friends.

675
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,940
Hi.

676
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,140
You know, you really put
yourself on the radar tonight.

677
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,170
Better not make that mistake
again, or you'll pay for real.

678
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,530
She can threaten me all she wants.

679
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,280
I'm not going back to social oblivion.

680
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,830
Don't worry.

681
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:09,280
Next time we take Jenny
down, it'll be for good.

682
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,620
Some people think that
when the party ends,

683
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,520
the night is over.

684
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,420
But I've found,

685
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,300
it's when the music stops
and the lights come up

686
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,140
that the real trouble begins.

687
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,080
Hi.

688
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,380
I'm glad you came. I want to apologize.

689
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,190
I shouldn't have said anything.

690
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,570
No, I'm... I'm glad you did.

691
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,500
But I don't think it's a good idea

692
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,730
for me to work for you anymore.

693
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,030
I actually came here to say that I quit.

694
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,000
I completely understand
why you'd want to quit

695
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,780
After what I said today.

696
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,360
But don't throw this away, Serena.

697
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,750
You deserve this opportunity.

698
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,740
And I want you there.

699
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,530
For whatever reason, I trust you,

700
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:56,220
And I don't have many
people I can say that about

701
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,100
in my work or my life.

702
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,900
Yeah, I, uh... 

703
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,120
I feel the same way.

704
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:07,580
And I promise to never cross that line.

705
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,140
We're both adults.

706
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:13,050
We'll just agree to keep things
friendly and professional.

707
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,350
Okay.

708
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,860
Friendly and professional.

709
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,890
Plus, I still owe you for the injury.

710
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,950
Yeah.

711
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,310
Serena!

712
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:34,230
I mean, Serena, there you are.

713
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:37,650
May I speak to you alone
for a moment, please?

714
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,360
Hey, Tripp.

715
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,370
Blair, it's okay.

716
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,250
I'll call you tomorrow. I'm... I'm fine.

717
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,420
I can see that.

718
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,590
I'm sorry. She's a little... 

719
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,500
did you even... 

720
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:03,140
I still really don't get

721
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,150
how these events work.

722
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,670
One chance, two chances.

723
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,100
Jonathan, Graham, Nate.

724
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,540
Even I can't explain that one.

725
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,910
- But I don't think I've seen Jenny this happy... 
- Ahh.

726
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:17,030
since she was 8 and
made her first dress.

727
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,550
Thanks, Lil.

728
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,660
I know the committee
didn't make it easy for you

729
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,480
to let in a Humphrey from Brooklyn.

730
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,600
Well, what kind of parents would we be

731
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,210
if we didn't do what we could
to make our children happy?

732
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:35,180
Mmm. Coming to bed?

733
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,790
Mm, yeah, in a minute.

734
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,090
Uh, Vanya said there's something
to sign from Bass Industries.

735
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:42,300
- Okay. Yeah. 
- Mm.

736
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,790
You better get your beauty rest now,

737
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:28,990
because it looks like things
could get ugly in the morning.

738
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:32,200
XOXO, Gossip Girl.
