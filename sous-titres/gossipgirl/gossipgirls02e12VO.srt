00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,190
Gossip girl's here

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,730
Your one and only source

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,440
Into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.

4
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,600
Sounds like you still like him.

5
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,620
I'm really sorry about Nate

6
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,330
I mean, if it's any consolation,

7
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,620
I don't think he ever really liked me anyway.

8
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:12,780
I haven't heard from him in weeks

9
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,110
Our friendship is more important than some guy, right?

10
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,510
He has a p.L on retainer

11
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,610
Bass people are top-notch

12
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,700
Did you hire someone to look into my past?

13
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,740
Do you have a Lily Bass dossier?

14
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,850
Aaron aked me out,but i said no,

15
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,590
Because i wasn't sure how will you feel?

16
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,320
I like Aaron, so you have my blessing.

17
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,220
What are you doing here?

18
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,670
It's thanksgiving,

19
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,010
And i couldn't think of anywhere that far more like home

20
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,950
What about Bart?

21
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,780
Not coming

22
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,540
Vanessa, i haven't heard from Jenny for weeks

23
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,370
So, can we get together sometime?

24
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,770
I guesee i will be ok?

25
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,320
As of right now, this moment

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,840
Winter in New York

27
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,440
A gossip girl checklist to surviving the cold

28
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,670
Ice-skating

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,130
Hot chocolate for

30
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,560
Window-shopping the holiday displays

31
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,570
And the perfect day

32
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,190
拉开帷幕的完美时刻

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,370
B., I have other things to do today.

34
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,630
Serena, this is the holiday event for high school seniors.

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,290
E crm de la crm from all the big private schools

36
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,050
Will be there. The pictures dominate the society pages

37
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,330
Through the new year. I need a ringer.

38
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,960
Wait, have allf these guys asked you already

39
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,690
Of course. You think angelina jolie

40
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,990
Even considering

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,630
I'm strictly pay or play dater. Just out of curiosity,

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,780
Who's in t lead to play "guy with no future"?

43
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,170
What makes you think I not looking for something long-term?

44
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,820
Call it a hunch. Keith nelson.

45
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,980
Are you kidding? Have you ever seen him without gum?

46
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,500
He'll drive you insane

47
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,760
Andy cla. Outscored your verbal on the s.A.T.S.

48
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,470
I like an intelligent man.

49
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,340
He can whisper mellifluous nothings in my

50
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,860
Ear. You only think you like an intelligent man

51
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,160
The moment he gave you a history of the word "mellifluous,"

52
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,360
You'd rip out his sweetly flowing tongue.

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,420
Okay.

54
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:13,250
Okay, now this... Okay. Hey, um, I'll call you later.

55
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,060
So who's next?

56
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,330
Dan! Hey.

57
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,170
Hey. What's up? Look

58
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,530
Wow. "letters to a young poet," first edition.

59
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,690
And the original herter norton translation to boo that's...

60
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,620
All thanks to you. I found it

61
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,800
At the rare booktore you told me about last week.

62
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,800
I'm giving it to aaronfor hanukah. That's very nice. It means he must've

63
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,730
Accepted your invition to the snowflake ball.

64
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,000
Unfortately, he will be unable to attend. Oh.

65
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,760
Apparently, high society formals

66
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,790
Don't go with the whole brooklyn artist thing.

67
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,640
Well, i--it's an acquired taste, to be sure.

68
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,840
Um... Will you still be going?

69
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,650
Absolutely.

70
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,150
There's somethini love about the snowflake ball.

71
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,890
It reminds me of "anna karenina,"

72
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,410
Only by anna wintour.

73
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,580
I'll just be flying solo. That's my preferred method of social travel.

74
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,120
That's good. Uh, we can-- we can hang out then.

75
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,950
Dan humphrey, the scoue of high society,

76
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,350
Is going to the ball I know. I'm still reeling.

77
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,040
Uh, yeah, I just realized that some of the best memories

78
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,690
In my past two years have,h, have been at those events.

79
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,500
So I figured, why fit it?

80
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,330
Well, look who's embracing chge.

81
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,370
Uh, I'm assuming that aaron will be okay with

82
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,340
Two dateless friends hanging out at the ball together

83
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah. He--he better be.

84
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,840
And he's friends with his ex, lexi.

85
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,240
She's actually coming to town for the hodays.

86
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,640
I'm going to the gallery now to s his new installation.

87
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,770
Do you want to come? I just have to stop and change first.

88
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,050
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

89
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,920
I got your message. What's the emergency?

90
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,980
Do you considermuddy watters

91
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,610
Blues or classic rock?

92
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,870
I'm reorganizing my dad's record collection by genre.

93
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,890
Why? Because I already bound all of dan's short stories

94
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,380
And cleaned the loft twice. Did you accidentally put red bull

95
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,160
In your cereal this morning? No, I just need keep myself busy.

96
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,800
Otherwise, I'm gonna start thinking about my future,

97
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,680
And then there's gonna bea jenny humphr

98
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,370
Through my wall. Okay, woulyou stop putting so much pressure on yourself?

99
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,750
You're back home and you're still a great designer.

100
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,100
The future will work itself out it's

101
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,840
Just that's not all I'm thinking about

102
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,060
What? Okay, look, I don't... I don't want to be awkward,

103
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,790
But the one thing I can't figure out is what happened with nate.

104
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,980
Is that totally pathetic, sitting around,

105
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,480
Thinking about how some guy blew you off? No.

106
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,540
But in my experience, it doesn't really help either.

107
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,470
I'd...

108
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,330
Move on.

109
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,380
NATE CALLING

110
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,890
Sorr I told rufus that I'd be at the gallery all day.

111
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,250
So, i'll see you later?

112
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,400
Yeah. I'll be here, literally... Probably in the same spot.

113
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,950
Oh, hello, weird documentary girl.

114
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,830
Good-bye, sad blair wannabe.

115
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,670
Penelope, what are you doing here?

116
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,070
Snowflake ball--i wanna commission a dress.

117
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,320
Your fashion show was impressive. Thanks, but snowflake ball's tomorrow,

118
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,560
And I kinda hate y, so--

119
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,510
I know, but this is about shion, not friendship, j.

120
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,960
Hazel and is keep biting my style,

121
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,800
And I need something custom.

122
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,580
I'm very expensive. I hope so.

123
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,830
I think we'd better have a second snowflake machine.

124
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,770
I an, it is called the snowflake ball.

125
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,240
We can't have drizzle.

126
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,330
I thought the decorating committee

127
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,240
Agreed on poinsettias. Ohthey did. I didn't. Uh, casablanca lilies.

128
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,410
Sneaky.

129
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,820
Hey, thanks for offering, um, to help out.

130
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,870
It's really been fun. Well, when you just happened to mention

131
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,250
My background inound systems

132
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,000
And lack of volunteer hours at the last p.T.A. Meeting...

133
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,560
I so of got your signal. Sorry. I had to get out of the house,

134
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,980
And I didn't want to be wn here alone.

135
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,660
You and bart still haven't talked.

136
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,340
No, it's my fault. Since thanksgiving,

137
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,160
I've pretty much hung up the, uh,

138
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,140
Marital "do not disturb" sign. Well,

139
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,890
You're gonna have to talk to him sooner or later

140
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,760
Well, isn't that what new year's resolutions are for?

141
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,030
Have you decided

142
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,630
If you're going to, uh, make it to the dance or not?

143
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,630
Witness the fruit of your labors jury's still out.

144
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,990
All right,ell, if you do, save me a dance.

145
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,540
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

146
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,020
We need to talk.

147
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,360
Fine

148
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,840
Aw, they're adorable!

149
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,940
You know, I feel inspired to...

150
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,290
Shop at the gap.

151
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,710
Or, , validate my self-image with overpriced cosmetics.

152
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,650
Wait a minute.

153
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,370
You sure this one didn't just ce with the frame?

154
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,930
Womehave been the focal point for artists throughout history,

155
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,340
Exactly

156
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,950
And with blondie the bombshell, no less-- sena, dan, hey. This is lexi.

157
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,320
The ex? I was wondering when'd finally meet you.

158
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,700
So i-i know I probably should've asked you sooner,

159
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,630
But how would you feel

160
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,110
About coming with me to the snowflake ball?

161
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,460
I would love to,

162
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,460
But I don't--i don't think it's a very good idea right now.

163
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,920
Oh, you mean, you haven' told jenny about us?

164
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,540
Look, I know you guys are close,

165
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,920
And I'm the last person who'd want to come between friends.

166
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,400
But believe me. Jenny doesn't care.

167
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,410
I mean, she prettyuch blew me off. But what--what if she didn't?

168
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,050
I mean, what if you found out that she still liked you?

169
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,450
I mean...

170
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,400
Vanessa, I'm--i'm really happy right now.

171
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,430
Let's just go with this. Please.

172
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,190
Okay. Okay.

173
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,110
But... What? What?

174
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,210
We're ingossip girl" country, so rein in your horses. Hmm.

175
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,540
You're probably right. Huh? Okay.

176
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,970
So tell me. Whatever happened between you and nate?

177
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,490
I'm sorry?

178
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,310
Please. Your kiss was all over "gossip girl."

179
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,440
And he was living here, wasn't h

180
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,140
It--uh, yeah, for a little bit. Um...

181
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,810
Why do you care?

182
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,030
Now that the archibald name is on the social rebound,

183
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,600
I was thinking of asking nate to the ball.

184
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,210
So what's thstory?

185
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,810
Nothing.

186
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,390
Um, nothing even happened between us, so...

187
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,070
Well, I wouldn't beat yourself up about it.

188
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,740
I mean, you had to know it was doomed from the start.

189
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,200
He's upper east side, and you're, well... Here.

190
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,200
Yove gotta be kidding me.

191
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,870
Sorry, ladies

192
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,180
For those of you who are hoping to find Nate Archibold

193
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,280
Under your tree

194
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,220
Looks like he's already pick up his own

195
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,230
I really don't appreciate

196
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,870
Your showing uunannounced at a school function.

197
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,250
I'm sorry, but you haven't left me many options,

198
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,720
And we do need to talk. Fine. Talk.

199
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,830
It's, uh...

200
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,190
It's been a long time since I've beea husband, lily.

201
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,700
And I just want you to know that I fired andrew tyler,

202
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,890
That private investigator who gathered all those files.

203
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,940
No more snooping. No more trying to control you and the kids.

204
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:34,110
It's done, and I'm sry for everything.

205
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,280
Thank you, but, um,

206
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,410
I don't think that that's enough.

207
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,660
Wellthen tell me what is, and I'll do it.

208
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:47,640
I can change, lily. You know I can...

209
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,930
If you'll let me.

210
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,050
I should be back from my miami trip

211
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,620
In time to go to the ball.

212
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,470
So if you want to think aut what I said

213
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,450
And are willing to give me a second chance,

214
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,720
I'd be honored to accompany you.

215
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,860
I, um, I have to go.

216
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,250
There's a few more tngs I have to do inside.

217
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,830
I know lexi can be a bit much.

218
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,670
Blair waldorf is my best friend.

219
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,180
Can handle "much," but that felt personal.

220
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,650
She doesn't mean anythg by it. She thinks she's protecting me.

221
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,650
Oh, great! Well, how long is the enforcer gonna be with us?

222
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,880
Uh, she's staying th her folks through the holiday.

223
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,660
So is that christmas eve? Or are we talking new year's eve?

224
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,030
Or--or maybe boxing y?

225
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,240
You have any kopi luwak back there?

226
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,910
Uh, kopi what wak? It's a coffe made from berries

227
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,020
That have been passed by the asian palm civet.

228
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,340
It's a c. Oh.

229
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,340
I had it in indonesia. It's delicious. Well,

230
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,900
Our cat lives with our grandmother in florida

231
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,580
My sister has allergies. That's a shame.

232
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:57,190
Yeah, uh, we d however, have this bag here

233
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,030
Of nondescript beans whose berries have been passed

234
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,330
Through a massive corporate infrastructure, so...

235
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,560
You're funny.

236
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,520
Come on. It would mean a lot toe if you gave her a chance.

237
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,880
Plse?

238
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,780
Okay. Fine.

239
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,830
But as long as we're swappi favors here,

240
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,140
It'd really make me fe much better about you

241
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,010
Spending all this time with her if you...

242
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,490
I don't know, escorted me to my senior winter dance?

243
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,000
Fine. U got yourself a deal.

244
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,530
So... New plan for tonight--

245
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,550
Dan here has agreed to give me a walking tour of brooklyn...

246
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,890
Yeah, last-minute, i-- and I thought it

247
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,400
Might be fun for e four of us to hang out

248
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,830
Get to know each other.

249
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,600
I mean, unless the two of you guys want to hang out alone.

250
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,270
No, no. Sounds great, lexi.

251
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,820
Anyone home?

252
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,650
I have a gift certificate to grimaldi's,

253
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,080
And I'm thinking double pepperoni.

254
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,950
Everything okay?

255
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,280
How could you?

256
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,990
Really, vanessa?

257
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,100
Lying and seeing nate behind my back?

258
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,730
I'm...

259
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:19,920
So sorry.

260
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,260
I have been meaning to tell you. I just wast sure how.

261
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,170
You ew this entire time why nate wasn't calling,

262
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,550
And it was because he was with you!

263
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,980
I derstand that you're upset. But if I remember correctly

264
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,060
Youkissed nate behind my back first. And I felt so horrible about it

265
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,020
That I ran after you, and you were gone.

266
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,640
So what happened to not letting a guy get in between us?

267
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,310
Are you really that desperate, vanessa?! Are you that jealous, jenny?

268
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,730
Oh, my god! I'm sorry you found out this way. I .

269
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,050
But since you haveyou might as well know that nate asked me

270
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,690
To the ball tomorrow nig, and I think I'm gonna go.

271
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,590
What do you want, bass? It occurred to me day

272
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,570
When I was having my afternoon shiatsu

273
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,360
I choose your date

274
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,980
You, why?

275
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,830
Why not?

276
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,370
And it'll let me prove I know you better than anyone ee.

277
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,440
Fine. Then I choose yours.

278
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,080
I bring a date for you, you bring one for me.

279
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,950
Paying attention

280
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,420
To the other desires

281
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,640
There has to be something to keep you honest...

282
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,760
And make things interesting.

283
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,610
Name the stakes.

284
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,480
Ifou actually like your date,

285
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,650
I get your limo for a month.

286
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,800
Fine.

287
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,410
And if you like yours, I gedorota.

288
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,540
What? Dorota?

289
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,760
Yes, miss blair?

290
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,050
Fine.

291
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:47,650
By the way, I take my breakfast in bed.

292
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,850
What are you staring at?

293
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,530
Go polish something.

294
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,300
You know, i-i write on these benches all t time.

295
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,560
And actually, norman mailer

296
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,370
Used to live in that townhousright there.

297
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,010
You can't imagine homany times

298
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,020
I thought about knocking on s door.

299
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,780
Why didn't you? Uh, common crtesy?

300
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,960
Okay. It's a door, but... Whaver.

301
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,070
No. E's-- she's--she's right.

302
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,420
I-i n't know why I'm always so worried

303
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,090
Abt what people might think of me.

304
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,900
It certainly hasn't paid off. Wow! And he, I thought the "y" chromosome

305
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,730
Was incapable of change. Look at you two branching out.

306
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,940
Aaron decided he would escort me

307
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,490
To the snowflake ball tomorrow night.

308
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,120
Oh. Wait, I'm sorry. Pause. Snowflake ball?

309
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,290
Yeah. Yeah, it's this, uh,

310
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,160
This, uh, school charity dance that serena and I have.

311
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,430
And you're going as well? Yeah.

312
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,350
And what?

313
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,240
I'm here to test-drive the norman mailer anecdote

314
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,820
For your actual date tomorrow night at the ball?

315
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,860
No. Uh, no I don't have a date, actually.

316
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,220
Uh, you know what? I just h the craziest idea.

317
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,370
Why don't the four of us go together?

318
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,030
That is, if you would be my date. Well, it depends.

319
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,850
That little speech you st gave...

320
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,130
Well, he doesn't live there anymore. Not really the poi, is it?

321
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:07,110
He--he--the man's dead. Come now. Ring doorbell.

322
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,880
You okay with h coming tomorrow?

323
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,030
Well, yeah. It's a little "when harrmet crazy."

324
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,980
But as long as dan's fine with it...

325
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,050
I'm guessing he'll end up being more than fine with it.

326
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,460
Meing?

327
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,470
Lexi likes to sleep with guys on the first date.

328
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,990
She claims it's a political statement

329
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,700
Against male-dominated sexual hypocrisy.

330
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,900
Or something.

331
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,620
Well, can't she just vote?

332
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,370
In her defense, she--she-- she dates very few guys.

333
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,590
But once there's one in hersights,

334
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,910
That's pretty much it

335
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,030
You still okay?

336
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,790
Whatever. Yeah, whatever.

337
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,270
Taking off? Rning meeting in miami. I should be back tomorrow.

338
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,970
Sure that's wise?Seems

339
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,250
The old marriage thermostat is headed

340
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,320
South of late. And whose ult is that

341
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,050
Thanksgiving was a disaster because of those files.

342
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,530
You think I don't know who had the combination to that safe?

343
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,910
Every time I think we're making pgress...

344
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,120
Yoshow your true colors.

345
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,960
Hey. Uh, your housekeeper let me in.

346
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,650
Good, then she can let you out.

347
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,390
What? And tell your frnd vanessa

348
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,780
It's not wise to fish in our pond.

349
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,670
Mm. Well, she's not my friend.

350
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,320
Really? Because we were just trying to think of a way

351
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,610
To send her a little message.

352
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,930
Feast your eyes, ladies.

353
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,500
Well what do you think?

354
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,280
I think you shouldn't

355
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,900
Stand in front of the light in that dress.

356
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,650
Oh, my god!It's see-through!

357
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,330
Well, that's one way to be the center of attention.

358
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,890
Least you don't have to worry about going home alone.

359
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,860
Oh, what do you guys think vanessa's

360
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,030
Wearing to the ball? She's going to t ball

361
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,380
Yeah, with nate.

362
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,690
Jenny, isabel's dress looks a little like one of yours,

363
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,900
Don't you think? No.  Not at l.

364
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,610
I know of a little something called "lining."

365
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,640
Well, what if you didn't?

366
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,730
Snowflake or snowfake

367
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,540
Either way, it's gonna be a ball

368
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,510
Chuck is in for the shock of his life.

369
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,590
I have depths he'll never plumb,

370
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,200
But I know every inch of his wafer-thin soul.

371
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,190
What do you think? You're right.

372
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,590
Louboutin peep toes, always.

373
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,760
Hey, just so you know, seeing someone with ur ex,

374
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,690
Even if you think you're ready... Not easy. I assume you're talking about

375
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,030
Your lame outer-boroughs double date last night

376
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,750
What happened? Uh, nothing. It was great... Ght up until

377
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,690
Dan asked lexi to go with him to the snowflake ball.

378
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,820
So they're going to the dance? Yeah, and then I found out

379
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,800
She tends to extend herself to guys on a first date.

380
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,980
So? So?! We're--we're friends.

381
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,140
So shouldn't i, likegive him a heads-up or something? Oh, absolutely.

382
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,940
Guys hate to be caught off guard with sex on the first date.

383
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,180
You're right. You're right.

384
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,450
I should just not think about it.

385
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,740
Exactly, just like I'm sure dan doesn't ink about

386
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,300
You and aaron all horizontal and sweaty.

387
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,540
Wait, you guys have slept together, haven't you?

388
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,580
Why not?! He's hot, and you actually like him.

389
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,970
How often do you find thatin the

390
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,190
Which is w I haven't rushed into anything.

391
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,010
You wanna wait? Fine. But in the meantime,

392
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,410
N is going to be taking a ride on the lexi-coaster.

393
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,770
Think about it.

394
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,330
Jenny.

395
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,500
What are you doing here?

396
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,040
I'm still mad at you. So what,

397
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,910
You're gonna kille and put me in the garment bag

398
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,480
I can't sleep last night

399
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,970
I was up half the night making this

400
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,460
Before I realizedwho it was for.

401
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,750
You made that for me?

402
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,910
Yeah. I mean, um...

403
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,780
I said some pretty awful this 'cause I was hurt.

404
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,860
So I guess just consider this a peace offering.

405
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,090
You'll look great.

406
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,370
I, uh... I don't-- I don't know what to say.

407
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,890
Just say you'll try  on.

408
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,400
Okay.

409
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,160
I thought I made it clear

410
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,530
That wneed to find chuck the perfect date.

411
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,810
Kristin curran is the loosest girl in our class.

412
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,630
Don't you know

413
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,230
At chuck doesn't like his fruit pre-picked? She has long hair.

414
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,330
In poland, long hair symbolizes-- and elizabetphillips

415
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,670
Is somhere between mormon and moron!

416
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,430
How did you come up withhese? Facebook. I joined few groups.

417
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,590
This has to be chuck's dream girl--

418
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,640
Intelligent but not a bookworm,

419
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,560
Strong-willed but still feminine. An equal.

420
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,550
And he likes brunettes with deep brown eyes.

421
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,520
But, miss blair, tt's you-- no, that girl is out there,

422
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,890
And you better hope for your sake that I find her!

423
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,080
Please. I don't want to shine mr. Chuck's shoes for month.

424
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,710
Yeah, his shoes if you're lucky. What?

425
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,740
Nothing. Now get back to work. Ticktock, ticktock.

426
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,110
Hello? You know, when you rent a tux in ooklyn,

427
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,570
They throw in the shoes.

428
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,110
No, i-i didn't know that. Um, what's going on?

429
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,730
Uh, well, this is probably stupid,

430
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,690
But I just wanted to make sure that this was all okay with you.

431
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,890
You know, uh, you, me, lexi and aaron.

432
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,690
Yeah, of--of course. Why wouldn't it be?

433
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,320
Well, I don't know. Dramatic precedent?

434
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,590
Well, I think we've outgrown that.

435
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,670
Good. Good. Me, too.

436
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,530
Uh, yoknow, I have to say,

437
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,320

I know. I know, but, um...

445
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,600

Later tonight.

448
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,440
Really?

Um, jenny, about the whole-- handbag.

00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,510
Wait. I have to tell you something.

454
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,040
When I flipped out on you yesterday

455
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,220
And asked if you were jealous,

456
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,460
It's because I always have been a little... Of you andan.

457
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,170
And to me,rowing up, you guys had it all.

458
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,970

467
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,420
Hello, mrs. Landingham.

468
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,570
Could you tell bart

469
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,760
That I'm waiting for him to go to the snowflake ball?

470
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,840
Well... A meeting?

471
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,410
Well, who's it with?

472
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,420

I won't be waiting,

478
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,960
And he shouldn't come to the ball.

479
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,580
We all set?

480
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,840
Jenny called after she delivered the dress.

481
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,990
Brooklyn betty walks in, we cue the song...

482
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,760
Hazel's new boyfriend hits her with thspotlight.

483
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:27,250
I hate you all. Anwe expose her in nothing but her cheap glass slippers.

484
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,390
Nate... Save me a dance?

485
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,540
Oh. Uh, yeah. Sure.

486
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,680
Are you chuck bass? Are you blair's girl? Not bad.

487
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:42,160
You know, the roof has a ectacular view of the city.

488
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,320
Excuse me. He's taken. Shoo.

489
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,550
You look lovely.

490
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,250
Not as lovely as I'll look in my limo.

491
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,210
Where's my prie uncharming?

492
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,220
Sabox rules. I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

493
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,520
Fine

494
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,890
Here she comes. Justine, this is chuck bass.

495
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,770
Very nice to meet you.

496
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,580
You can't be serious.

497
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,630
I need to talk to you.

498
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,110
Excuse us.

499
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,010
Looks like tonight's the night.

500
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,030
What, uh, what are you-- what are you talking about?

501
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,900
Well, aaron likes to play things a little close to the vest.

502
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,320
Took aittle arm-twisting, but I finally found out

503
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,320
That serena gave him the green light for tonight.

504
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,380
Oh, you--they-- they haven't had sex?

505
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,710
U're not as quick on the uptake

506
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,550
As you pretend to be humphrey.

507
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,420
Do you care?

508
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,330
I don't. I don't.

509
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,860
We both know that I'm you're one and only,

510
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,420
And a canal street knockoff seemedike the best option.

511
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,540
My thinking exactly. Fine.

512
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,660
You know, if beta-bass is anything like the original,

513
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:10,440
I've no doubt

514
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,340
That sooner or later, he'll disappointment me.

515
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,820
And I'm curious to see if the new blair

516
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:18,210
Has all the features I so enjoyed on the oldodel.

517
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,360
So t bet is still on? Unless you're prepared to concede?

518
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,220
To you? Neve

519
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,470
Hi, rufus.

520
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,330
Where's bart?

521
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:54,980
I'm leaving him.

522
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,320
I'm doing it for me. I don't expect anything.

523
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,100
Expt maybe a dance.

524
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,790
Uh, so you and aaron seem likeyou're ha

525
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,340
So do you guys.

526
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,410
What?

527
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,340
Uh, no, uh, lexi told me about...

528
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,280
Your--your and aaron's plan tonight, that's all.

529
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:04,340
Oh. I am gonna miss her when she's gone.

530
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:04,960
No, I only mention it

531
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,930
Because we're, you know, we're friends now.

532
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,490
So, uh, is there anything you wanna

533
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,840
Talk aut? Well, what's there to talk about

534
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,140
We've--we've been dating for a while.

535
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,110
We've gotten to know ch other.

536
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,890
It's not like we're rushing intonything.

537
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,430
Right. And that' uh, that's, you know, that's important.

538
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,360
Well, it is to some people. I know lexi has

539
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:26,650
A more "come hither" attitude about sex.

540
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,100
Ght. Wait, what?

541
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,790
Well, she'planning on seducing you tonight.

542
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,540
Seduce--sedung me? I...

543
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,640
What does "wow" mean?

544
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,340
Well, i-i always assumed that i...

545
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:49,590
Would, uh... You know, again sooner or later.

546
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,120
Maybe "assumed" is a strong word.

547
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,170
"hop" is probably more accurate.

548
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,360
What?

549
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,920
Mm. Nothing. I just... You and lexi together...

550
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:06,130
I-i just thought sex was aningful to you, you know?

551
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,980
Well, it is,

552
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,580
And especially when I haven't had it in a long time.

553
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:14,950
Right.

554
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,570
Okaythen. Have fun.

555
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,610
Well, serena, i... Was kidding.

556
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,350
There you are.

557
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,490
I'm parched. Drinks?

558
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,210
Sure.

559
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,540
Jenny? What are you doing here?

560
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,610
It--it doesn't matter.

561
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,260
I'm ending things with nate.

562
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,580
What?

563
00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:00,910
I never meant to hurt you. Please believe that.

564
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,690
Where is she? How long does that

565
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,910
Subway thingy take? Maybe she's not coming

566
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,170
Or little j. Had second thoughts.

567
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,900
Vanessa!

568
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,870
Finally. Showtime.

569
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,550
Wow, you look gorgeous thank you.

570
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,420
I need tell you something,

571
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,320
And while I do, I need for you not to say anything.

572
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,490
Okay.

573
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,550
I've, ...

574
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,740
I've nev...

575
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,900
I've never felt this way about anyone before.

576
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,090
Never.

577
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:56,590
And it made me do something that I can't believe I did.

578
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,900
Jenny never got your letter.

579
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,450
That's why youever heard from her again.

580
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,870
I took it before she saw it.

581
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,720
And I'm sorry.

582
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,260
Vanessa!

583
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,190
Poor vanessa.

584
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,480
Even cinderella

585
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,050
Was given the courtesy of a stealth getaway.

586
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,080
Then ain, what's a pair of ugly stepsisters

587
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,170
Compared to jenny humphrey?

588
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,700
Vanessa, here. Take this. Vanessa, wait.

589
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,200
Please!

590
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,990
Looks like it might turn out to be

591
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,620
An unhappily ever after for everyone.

592
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,180
Jenny, did you do that to vessa?

593
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,760
You don't understandthough. Oh, she completely--

594
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:28,150
She what? She lied? She went behind your back?

595
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,290
So what?

596
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,180
For that she deserved to be publicly humiliated?

597
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,680
She's your friend, jenny.

598
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:45,360
You know, there's no reason for meo tell you this now,

599
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:49,450
But I wrote you this letter after the fashion show,

600
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,220
Telling u I had feelings for you.

601
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,270
I never got that.

602
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,540
No, I know. Vanessa stole it.

603
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:01,840
But she felt so bad about it, she came and told me the truth.

604
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,800
Okay, look, i...

605
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:09,310
I know what you must think ofe right now.

606
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,960
But if I'd-- if I'd gotten that-- well, I'm glad you didn't.

607
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,880
Honestly, you're not who thought you were.

608
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,470
Where are they?

609
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,680
Relax. They'll be here somewhere.

610
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,460
This is the worst out--body experience ever.

611
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:36,130
Hey! Explain this!

612
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,440
After you and chuck walked off, justine and I got to talking.

613
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,170
He took me up to theoof, and we looked over the city.

614
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,120
Well, of course he did.

615
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,000
We just knew we were meant for each other.

616
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:49,650
Bushe's me, only less. I gave her that headband.

617
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,960
We're as surprised as you a.

618
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,150
Everne, even our doppelgangers,

619
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,980
Cawork it out, but we can't?

620
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,020
I hate that I have to hurt him.

621
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,360
Know it sounds strange,

622
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:16,280
But I suddenly feel horrible out what I have to do.

623
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,340
I'd be worried abt you if you didn't.

624
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,830
And the kids.

625
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,440
Oh, eric has become so accustomed to him.

626
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,300
Eric wants you to be happy.

627
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,570
I never thought my life would turn out like this.

628
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,770
I've always tried to do the right thing.

629
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,790
It's all youcando.

630
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,250
Ju, uh...

631
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,430
Smile and fake it.

632
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,530
Tell me something, rufus.

633
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,970
What?

634
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,860
Something you shldn't.

635
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:04,950
I nevewanted to weigh in about your relationship with bart.

636
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,820
I was...

637
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,400
Afraid of what I might say.

638
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,000
Which was?

639
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,740
I let you go on your wedding day because...

640
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,740
I was afraid I coun't give you what you needed.

641
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,430
I wasn't surwhat I needed.

642
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,570
And I ve regretted it every day since.

643
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,910
As much as I appreciate mpany from the airport,

644
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,730
I thought I made myself clear.

645
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,780
Your services are no longer required.

646
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,780
Trust me, you gave me a final asgnment,

647
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,200
And you do wanna know what I found out.

648
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,100
This isn't a good time, chuck. She's here.

649
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,320
What are you talking about? Lily's at the ball with rufus humphy.

650
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,400
And fromhat I'm seeing,

651
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:07,880
You should figure something out and get down here now.

652
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,130
What do you have?

653
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,640
Charles.

654
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,270
You've been good for him,

655
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,720
Good for us.

656
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,960
I always liked you,

657
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,860
Regardless of how I may have acted.

658
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,740
He's on his way here.

659
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,590
You owe hia conversation.

660
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,380
Vanessa!

661
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,710
Wait.

662
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,130
You stole my letter.

663
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,420
I know.

664
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,480
Is there anything else yowanna tell me?

665
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,980
Pretty sure that was it

666
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,230
You said you never felt this way about anyone before.

667
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,930
Ishat true?

668
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,650
Does it matter?

669
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,850
Okay, listen, after all we've been through...

670
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,990
When you walked away tonight, all I could think was,

671
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,930
"she's the one I want to be with."

672
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,990
So, yeah, it matters.

673
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,370
It's easy for you to say

674
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,640
Because you didn't just pull a janet jackson

675
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,370
At the snowflake ball.

676
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,700
You wanna grab a drink?

677
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,010
Yes, I would.

678
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,640
Somewhere dark with no backlighting.

679
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,590
Well, maybe a little backlighng.

680
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,600
Mm, let'go. Okay.

681
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,260
Don't think we didn't see you try and save her.

682
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:40,870
We should've known you didn have what it takes. You never did.

683
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,820
You know, I don't know what's more pathetic--

684
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,490
That I wanted to be one of you, or that I wa

685
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,420
Actually scared of you. Either way,

686
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,330
That leaves you with thetic, you and your friend

687
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,210
Uh, oh, vanessa?

688
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,080
Vanessa is ten times the person you will ever be.

689
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,840
That is why you hate her so much. It'sinda easy

690
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:57,740
For you to talk big when you're hiding out in brooklyn.

691
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,920
Well, maybe we shod change that.

692
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,740
I'll seeou guys around.

693
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,720
Dance with me.

694
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:32,650
What's the point, chk? We're never gonna be them.

695
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,110
You said so. Remember?

696
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,740
It's not for us.

697
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,240
Maybe.

698
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,730
But it wouldn't change us

699
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,790
T if it meant losing what we have.

700
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,750
And what do we have, chuck? You tell me.

701
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,910
Tonight.

702
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,730
