00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
Gossip Girl here,

2
00:00:00,875 --> 00:00:03,500
your one and only source into
the scandalous lives

3
00:00:03,583 --> 00:00:04,750
of Manhattan's elite.

4
00:00:04,958 --> 00:00:05,708
Isn't that Carter Baizen?

5
00:00:05,708 --> 00:00:07,833
- Where were you?
- Oh, where wasn't he?

6
00:00:07,916 --> 00:00:09,750
He disowned his parents 
and took off around the world.

7
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,625
An affair with a student? Me and you?
I would never do that!

8
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,330
You were right about dan and rachel.

9
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,250
You have proof. give it to me.

10
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,760
If they find out that I let an outsider in

11
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,340
I'll protect you.

12
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,170
Your own father was one of them

13
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:19,990
and you didn't even know it.

14
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,860
Don't contact me again.

15
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,660
I'm sorry for the interruption,

16
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,420
But I have something

17
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,240
I think almost everyone here would want to see.

18
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,990
I'm back at constance, got into yale.

19
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,990
Everything's perfect again.

20
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,640
I thought you lied to me.

21
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,190
Then why were you so ready to believe the worst?

22
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,280
I think part of me wanted to.

23
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,010
- It's over, isn't it?- what are you doing here?

24
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,940
I came to apologize. I don't know what came over me.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,490
On the upper east side,

26
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,780
All the world's a stage

27
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,130
and all the men and women merely players.

28
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,440
But once a year, constance/ st.

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,760
Jude's students shed their usual roles and

30
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,810
Take on new ones for the senior class play.

31
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,890
This year's pick-- "the age of innocence."

32
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,690
I just can't believe this is a senior requirement or that

33
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:18,260
Chuck got a doctor to actually diagnose him with acute stage fright.

34
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,130
Should have gone with mercury poisoning.

35
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,160
Before "gossip girl," there was edith wharton,

36
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,260
And how little has changed.

37
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,770
The same society snobs still reigned,

38
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,130
Only in corsets and horse-drawn carriages.

39
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,830
When I saw "the age of innocence" with daddy,

40
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,480
I always pictured myself as winona,

41
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,140
But playing the stronger,

42
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,320
More emotionally complex female lead

43
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,800
Just feels so right.

44
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,920
Dorota, hairpin.

45
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:05,650
Besides, you're so much more suited to play may, who's so... pretty.

46
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,680
Uh, thanks.

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,280
At last, my life is perfect.

48
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,420
My only problem-- how to relate to my character.

49
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,190
Countess olenska is a ruined woman

50
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,970
With no prospects,

51
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,580
And let's face it£¨I have the world on a string.

52
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,520
Of course, there is the odious task of playing opposite dan humphrey.

53
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,950
Dorota, enough. how are you two doing, b.t.w?

54
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,490
I don't know.

55
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,750
I'm just trying not to think of him, distracting myself with other...

56
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,420
Distractions.

57
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,250
You mean your crush on our director?

58
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,280
Julian is kind of amazing, isn't he?

59
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,980
- Do you know that he directed - bogosian off-broadway

60
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,750
In his last year of juilliard, blah, blah, blah?

61
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,280
You can always depend on constance to snare some wunderkind.

62
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,480
But really, s., aren't you sick of brooding artists?

63
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,010
Well, he broods in the sexiest way, that is,

64
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,880
When he's not looking right through me.

65
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,580
Oh, my life is so bountiful.

66
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,750
I don't need a boyfriend to feel fulfilled.

67
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,540
Aah! oh, my god! come look at this!

68
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,810
But I do need silence to emotionally prepare for the stage.

69
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,250
What are you clucking about?

70
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,110
Nelly just got in early to yale.

71
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,180
Uh, that's impossible.

72
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,660
Yale only accepts one constance student early a year, and that's me.

73
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,620
She just got an e-mail directly from dean berube.

74
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,580
I have to find headmistress queller.

75
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,450
Julian, I added the fur collar to olenska's act two dress.

76
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,780
Add fur to the cuffs. humphrey!

77
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,610
This is an invited dress. backstage now.

78
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,010
I can't believe I volunteered to do costumes.

79
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,180
Oh, for the days of eleanor's atelier.

80
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,620
Wait. did I really just say that?

81
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,580
How did she even show her face after everthing she's done.

82
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:14,520
Dan, remember, in scene three, you enter from stage right, not stage left.

83
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,080
Stage left, right.

84
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,990
- No. no, stage right.- yeah, I got it.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,360
I just don't get why you want to do a documentary on all this.

86
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,180
Are you kidding?

87
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,520
A high school forks out a small fortune to stage a play... okay.

88
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,360
Hires broadway's hottest up-and-coming director--

89
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,080
That means you've got wealth, privilege, atrocious acting.

90
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,310
And the fact that you're doing "the age of innocence,"

91
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,310
- Well, that's just the icing on the cake.- okay.

92
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,280
- But don't worry. I won't make you look bad.- stop.

93
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,010
And whatever else,

94
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,020
"the age of innocence" is one of the most beautiful books ever. ugh.

95
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,750
It's, like, the most boring book ever.

96
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,340
Nothing happens.

97
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,520
Guy and girl want to be together, but can't, end of story.

98
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,550
Nate, the story's in the details.

99
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,970
The simple act of unbuttoning a glove expresses the character's

100
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,850
Inner passion. I can think of a lot more interesting ways to express my passion.

101
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,550
- Oh, really? - towards you.

102
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,010
Chuck bass. it's good to see you, son.

103
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,520
Mr. campbell, hello.

104
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,850
I, uh, I'm sorry for your loss.

105
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,710
I was in prague for the funeral.

106
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,180
I would have paid my respects in person.

107
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,660
Thank you. I'll come by the office.

108
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,210
I hear you're learning the ropes.

109
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,810
Trying to.

110
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,310
Enjoy. thanks.

111
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,480
- Is this okay?- perfect.

112
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,710
My lucky day. carter baizen back in town.

113
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,880
A delight to see you, bass.

114
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,350
Elle? you're all right.

115
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,850
You have the wrong person. my name is hayley.

116
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,910
What are you doing with this loser?

117
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,750
Back off, bass. the, uh, lady says she doesn't know you.

118
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,520
She knows me. I know you're in some kind of trouble.

119
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,880
Whatever kind of help you need,

120
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,840
You're not going to find it with him.

121
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,810
Carter, I have to use the ladies' room.

122
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,350
Get me a drink? just--just wait a sec.

123
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,780
Come on, bass. don't cause a scene.

124
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,710
Heard you were in thailand recently.

125
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:07,950
Of course I had to leave in a hurry.

126
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,620
You should have come to see me in singapore.

127
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,170
How was singapore?

128
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,010
I'm surprised you made it out in one piece.

129
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,190
I'm hooked up on every continent.

130
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,570
I landed last night, rrolled into apothe and met...

131
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,140
Well, who really cares what her name is, right?

132
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,110
- God bless america. - mr. baizen?

133
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,410
Your date just exited through the kitchen.

134
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,410
Welcome home.

135
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,840
Hey. jacket over vest and button to top.

136
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,040
Hello? what's wrong with you?

137
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,640
Oh, um, no, it's--it's nothing.

138
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,840
Did you see how those teachers treated rachel?

139
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,810
Yeah. they were like grown-up mean girls.

140
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,710
If I wrote a note, could you deliver it?

141
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,740
Dan, headmistress queller told her to stay away from you.

142
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,340
I saw how they were treating her.

143
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,870
it's--it's--it's my fault.

144
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,110
I just want to know that she's okay.

145
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,310
Hi, miss carr.

146
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,340
I love your necklace. is it new?

147
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,310
Uh, no. it's quite old, actually.

148
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,910
Well, it's very nice.

149
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,310
Hi. I am gonna sit in front until the first costume change.

150
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,330
Jenny, i-i really don't think that...

151
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,560
Thanks.

152
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,840
This is just a dress rehearsal.

153
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,720
There are people out there. don't let the--

154
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,840
headmistress! there you are.

155
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,810
Nelly yuki claimed she got into yale early.

156
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,920
There must be some mistake.

157
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,880
I'm sorry, blair. there's no mistake.

158
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,980
I was on my way to tell you

159
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,380
I received a call from dean berube.

160
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,910
They've rescinded your acceptance

161
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,680
and given the spot to nelly.

162
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,140
Is today april fool's?

163
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,780
Though I had previously informed yale of your detention,

164
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,240
I did not tell them what the punishment was for.

165
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,710
But apparently, an anonymous caller did.

166
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,980
The dean called for me to confirm the story.

167
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,710
I had no choice.

168
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,210
But I did penance for that.

169
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,450
I explained that you made amends,

170
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:46,280
But yale considers hazing a faculty member a very serious offense.

171
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,380
I'm sorry.

172
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,240
There must be something we can do.

173
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,810
Blair, it's over.

174
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,280
You will not be attending yale.

175
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,220
Every actress eventually finds the hook into her character,

176
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,810
Even if sometimes life has to give her a little push.

177
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,980
Waldorf, you're holding up the curtain.

178
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,510
Come. now.

179
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,870
Upon my soul, it's countess olenska,

180
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,010
parading herself at the opera.

181
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,710
It's a pity. her life is finished.

182
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,840
But don't worry, b.

183
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,840
When god closes a door, he opens a play.

184
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,620
Elle.

185
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,650
I need your help.

186
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,250
Oh, did you tell my cousin ellen of our engagement?

187
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,350
I hadn't had the chance.

188
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,780
oh, well, you mustn't. she's been away so long.

189
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,620
Did I miss much?

190
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,520
oh, no, just the first scene.

191
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,250
Hey, jenny, you dropped your...

192
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,250
Oh. wait. can i...

193
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,250
May knows as well as I do the real reason of her cousin staying away.

194
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,310
But I shall never let her see the least sign that I'm

195
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,650
Conscious of there being a shadow on poor ellen olenska's reputation.

196
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,920
Get me out of this. out of my way.

197
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,620
I need to make the fat lady sing.

198
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,650
- Pull! - it's stuck.

199
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,340
No, leave it. she'll need as much padding as possible.

200
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,150
What is your problem?

201
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,390
My problem is a two-faced,

202
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,740
four-eyed devious little snipe in a fat suit.

203
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,150
Did you really think you could

204
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,440
rat me out to yale and get away with it?

205
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,350
I don't know what you're talking about.

206
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,830
Everyone's jealous of me because my life is perfect,

207
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,280
And you've always been the most jealous of all.

208
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,850
People aren't jealous of you, blair. they hate you.

209
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,370
I didn't call yale,

210
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,120
and good luck figuring out who did.

211
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,060
There are about a thousand people

212
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,000
who would relish taking you down.

213
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,710
wanna hear the sickest scandal ever?

214
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,710
Remember b.'s lord?

215
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,960
It turns out he was giving the royal treatment to his own queen mother,

216
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,300
And the worst part?

217
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,140
B. knew and ignored it.

218
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,290
How desperate can you be, b.?

219
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,380
No wonder yale dumped you. who wants inbred legacies?

220
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,720
Someone's out to get you, blair. it's just not me.

221
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,540
Vanessa.

222
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,040
Julian. hey, I made the adjustment

223
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,430
you suggested in the garden scene.

224
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,070
Uh, yeah, yeah. um, good show, sabrina.

225
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,710
So how does it feel to play may welland?

226
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,840
Well, it feels like my character's rubbing off on me.

227
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,970
May's fiance pays no attention to her, and as for me...

228
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,210
Are you talking about julian?

229
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,270
Well, the play opens tomorrow. he's just distracted.

230
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,240
Julian, hey.

231
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,460
I was just thinking,

232
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,720
It would be really helpful for my friend vanessa's

233
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,510
Documentary to hear more about your vision for the show.

234
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,160
Why don't we all grab a bite to eat?

235
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,750
I suppose it couldn't hurt to, uh,

236
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,610
Give my actors a little more insight into my intentions.

237
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,400
Let me just grab my stuff. I'll meet you in front.

238
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,670
Airing my dirty laundry to yale

239
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,310
and sending the lord marcus "gossip girl" blast

240
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,440
makes you officially my enemy number one.

241
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,010
I don't know what you're talking about, blair.

242
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,870
- Honestly.-  what are you doing with her? we hate her.

243
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,910
I don't hate her. she's my friend, actually.

244
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,440
And you just need to calm down.

245
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,140
Calm down, serena? she got me axed from yale.

246
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,340
You're seriously taking her side?

247
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:26,550
Fine.

248
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,880
But a word of advice-- she will be destroyed,

249
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,780
And you don't want to become collateral damage.

250
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,310
Thank you.

251
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,240
I've been bathing like the french

252
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
in restaurant bathrooms all week.

253
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,310
So you've been on the run.

254
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,810
You know, I wanted to contact you.

255
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,410
I felt like we had a connection.

256
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,070
but I was scared.

257
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,070
- And carter? - I just met him.

258
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,010
He told me he was rich, so I thought he could help.

259
00:12:59,010 --> 00:12:59,590
Please.

260
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,240
Look, no one is going to hurt you.

261
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,890
Are you kidding?

262
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,540
You know the kind of people who are members.

263
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,390
They're powerful men,

264
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,040
And the things I know about them could destroy their lives.

265
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,290
Nobody ever told me that once you're in, you're in for good.

266
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,240
If only I could just leave the country,

267
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,340
Start over with a clean slate.

268
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,780
So that's what you'll do.

269
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,980
Money's not a problem.

270
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,540
- We'll get you a new identity, a new passport. - How?

271
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,640
I know a guy.

272
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,710
Thank you.

273
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,140
Just one question.

274
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,550
How do you feel about Brazil?

275
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,200
Scorsese said that he considers "Age of Innocence"

276
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,690
More violent than his films with guns and blood.

277
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,140
- Marty's inspiration was "The Heiress." - William Wyler.

278
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,840
So you're a Wyler fan? Have you ever seen "Little Foxes"?

279
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,980
Are you kidding?

280
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,290
Serena made me see it, like, what, three times?

281
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,390
She's obsessed with Bette Davis.

282
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,840
Yeah, Bette Davis.

283
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,330
I, um...

284
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,590
I love her eyes. Her hair is harlow gold.

285
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,160
- Hey, listen. I'm gonna take off, okay? - I'll come with.

286
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,270
Oh, I was just gonna tell you my take on the play.

287
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,490
Yes, that's a great idea.

288
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,060
Don't go, please.

289
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,150
Nate, do you mind?

290
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,190
No, no. It's, uh, it's cool. Listen I have...

291
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,450
Lines to practice anyway, so I'll go now.

292
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,690
So...

293
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,060
You know, uh, Nate's got the right idea.

294
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,750
I didn't realize how late it was.

295
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,800
Let me just grab the check.

296
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,240
Thank god.

297
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,040
Serena, I know you like him, but as your friend,

298
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,390
Julian is the most self-absorbed,

299
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,290
Pompous person I've ever met.

300
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,040
All he does is go on and on about classic movies,

301
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,140
And it's totally annoying.

302
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,040
You were keeping up with him pretty good there.

303
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:04,340
Yeah, and I'm totally annoying.

304
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,350
Thanks, ladies. Don't worry. It's taken care of.

305
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,750
- And, uh, it's been a lot of fun. - It has.

306
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,000
Uh, you know,

307
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,050
All this talk about Bette Davis has--has

308
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,330
Really got me thinking about my character.

309
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,140
You know, I think I could use some

310
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,190
More coaching before the show.

311
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,140
- What do you say? - Sure. Say 4:00? Text me your address.

312
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,330
Great.

313
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,960
- So what are you up to? - You mean, what are we up to?

314
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,640
I may not be a huge classic film buff,

315
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,850
But I have read "Cyrano."

316
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,950
Hey. Sorry. When I finally came out, you were gone. So...

317
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,420
You were great in the play. I just--

318
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,890
No, I-I meant with Rachel.

319
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,170
Do you, like--did she respond?

320
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,290
Uh, yeah. She wrote a note.

321
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,460
All right, w-well, great. Where is it?

322
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,410
Um, dad has it.

323
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:07,920
- Mr. Humphrey-- - I believe this belongs to you.

324
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:16,130
Poor Miss Iowa-- caught playing Mrs. Robinson.

325
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,230
Looks like the teacher just got schooled.

326
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,100
Dan, we need to talk.

327
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,950
Well, I've got nothing to say.

328
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,340
I went to see Miss Carr last night.

329
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,250
This thing between the two of you--it's over.

330
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,140
Well, we'll see.

331
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,800
You cannot be this short-sighted.

332
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,540
If word gets out about this, you'll be expelled.

333
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,250
Miss Carr will be fired for good.

334
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,190
Well, Miss Carr is the one who sent me the key.

335
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,290
So presumably, she understands that risk

336
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,590
And she's making her own decision.

337
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,900
However grown-up you think you are,

338
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,430
You're still in high school.

339
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,750
I care about Rachel, all right? And I'm 18.

340
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:48,750
So with all due respect, I think I'll decide who I see.

341
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,700
Oh, do go on, newland.

342
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,330
I do love your descriptions.

343
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,560
Well, why shouldn't we make them real?

344
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,530
We shall, my dearest, of course, next year.

345
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:08,200
See, May is all about what's proper.

346
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,190
You've read other Wharton novels, right?

347
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,030
"The House of Mirth"?

348
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,790
Yes. yes, I-I have.

349
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,010
Good, because "House of Mirth"

350
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,040
Was a huge influence on clayton.

351
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,090
Jack Clayton. He directed "the great gatsby."

352
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,090
Jack Clayton, "Gatsby."

353
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,690
Most critics consider it a failed adaptation.

354
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,430
No offense, Mr. Film Fanatic,

355
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,150
But I-I don't think the movie was nearly as good as the book.

356
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,290
I don't disagree.

357
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,860
Why do you say so?

358
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,190
Some blame Clayton's direction,

359
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,460
Others point the finger at Coppola's screenplay.

360
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,300
In "the times," vincent canby said--

361
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,490
- Whoa. Slow down. - Excuse me?

362
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,640
No excuse me.

363
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,950
It's just that sometimes my thoughts come so fast that I, uh,

364
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,090
I get confused.

365
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,740
Sorry.

366
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,500
From now on, I'll say a line,

367
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,140
And all you have to do is repeat it exactly.

368
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:49,940
You're quite right.

369
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,500
The film is... impotent.

370
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,590
It totally misses what the book is even about--

371
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,360
The eternal conflict between the repression of

372
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,140
Society and the passion of the individual.

373
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,240
You are so insightful, Julian.

374
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,130
I completely agree about the power of unexpressed passion.

375
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,690
You know, you are so insightful, Julian.

376
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:15,350
I completely agree about the power of unexpressed passion.

377
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,240
I have to confess, I underestimated you.

378
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,530
You're quite extraordinary.

379
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,500
Shall we get back to the scene?

380
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,790
What was that?

381
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,400
I'm sorry. Just one second.

382
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,500
It's a text.

383
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,600
Yale's hallowed halls have gone to hell.

384
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,890
S. got accepted, but not for her s.a.t. scores.

385
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,890
Allowing a press release was her only prerequisite.

386
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,850
I have to go.

387
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,800
I-I lost track of time again.

388
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,180
We're late for the theater. Are you ready to go?

389
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,860
Yeah. Yeah.

390
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,760
Good to see you, Hayley.

391
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,370
- Or should I call you Elle?  - sorry I ran off like that.

392
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,880
I just didn't know if I could trust you or not.

393
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,460
Baizen, you know I'm not your biggest fan,

394
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,230
- But you are an expert at crossing borders.  - I'm happy to oblige.

395
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,390
Especially if it means having Chuck Bass owe me a favor.

396
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,500
But my passport guy-- he's a bit of a paranoid freak.

397
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,820
- He won't like an entourage.  - I understand.

398
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,820
Look, you take Elle, and I'll meet you at Teterboro.

399
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,850
It's okay.

400
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,980
Thank you. I'm so grateful.

401
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,990
Don't worry, Bass.

402
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,300
We'll take care of her.

403
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,890
I've lost everything.

404
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,790
I'm humiliated and shunned.

405
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,180
They've made me a flesh-and-blood countess olenska.

406
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:01,910
You are an actress.

407
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,230
Pour it into the role. use pain onstage.

408
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:08,980
You're right.

409
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,170
I'm an actress.

410
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:13,420
no...

411
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,530
I'm a seagull.

412
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,860
No, you're a shameless bitch.

413
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,490
Now what?

414
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,820
Everything you've done

415
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,980
spreading rumors about who I've had sex with,

416
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,450
What alley I puked in

417
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,110
Or telling Dean Berube that I killed pete fairman

418
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,860
I forgave everything all because I thought one

419
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,790
Day you'd grow up, but putting out a "gossip girl" blast

420
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,340
about yale and the press release

421
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,120
Serena, I didn't put out the blast.

422
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,600
At least have the dignity not to lie to my face.

423
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,430
wait. but I'm not lying.

424
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,340
Only two people knew about it--you and Dan

425
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,910
and dan would never do something like that.

426
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,140
I always want to believe the best in you, Blair.

427
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,290
The bottom line is, betrayal's in your nature.

428
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,760
I didn't do it, Dorota.

429
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,890
I believe you, miss Blair.

430
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,530
And if I didn't, that means Dan Humphrey did.

431
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,430
Vanessa told him about marcus, and he could've put that out, too,

432
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,000
All to get back at me for teacher-gate.

433
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,850
Do you know how hard it is to get revenge

434
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,870
When your enemy is changing every five minutes?

435
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,540
You need to calm nerves and warm vocal chord. you want tea?

436
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,800
No, I want dan Humphrey's head on a platter.

437
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,230
Rachel, hey, hey. I've been looking for you everywhere.

438
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,040
- We have to talk. - no, no, dan. we need to stay away from each other.

439
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,190
My dad showed up at your house.

440
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,620
- We need to at least discuss this. - people are coming.

441
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,190
It was reckless of me to respond to your note.

442
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,700
Rachel...

443
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,980
What are we doing?

444
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,300
I-i can't help myself.

445
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,240
Am I supposed to pretend I'm not feeling what I'm feeling?

446
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,160
You know this can't last.

447
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:58,700
What can't?

448
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,330
Our staying away from each other.

449
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,010
Oh, mother's carriage has arrived.

450
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,120
- Do excuse me, dear.  - of course.

451
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,380
So what happened with julian?

452
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,850
We were in the middle of it, and then you just hung up.

453
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,810
oh, sorry. I had to get off the phone.

454
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:58,300
But I shall never let her see the least signs that I am

455
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,230
Conscious of there being a shadow on poor ellen olenska's reputation.

456
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:03,400
- I'll explain later.  - the next day,

457
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,390
mrs. Manson mingott received the young couple at a large

458
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:10,150
House in an inaccessible wilderness in the central park.

459
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,450
Girl, bring me my fan.

460
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,720
Yes. right away, ma'am.

461
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,810
Mr. archer and miss welland.

462
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:21,220
At last.

463
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,850
I was beginning to think you were so besotted

464
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,410
With love you'd forgotten about your old grandmother.

465
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,480
And when is the wedding to be?

466
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,420
- Thank you for meeting me, mr. campbell.  - oh, it's my pleasure, Chuck.

467
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,160
Your father was one of my closest friends.

468
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,970
Which is why I was hoping you could help me with something.

469
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,300
My father was a member of a club.

470
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,490
Oh, I can get you off the waiting list at any place in town. just name it.

471
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,070
I'm not talking racket sports. this is a gentlemen's club.

472
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,460
As it happens, carter baizen is a member, too.

473
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,820
- I'm not acquainted with mr. baizen.  - yesterday, park avenue winter?

474
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,730
- You left right when he did.  - I don't remember when I left.

475
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,290
And I don't know anything about a gentlemen's club.

476
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,220
The club moves every month.

477
00:23:59,400 --> 00:23:59,850
There are girls there.

478
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,690
My. my, my.

479
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,430
Well, Chuck...

480
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,300
I have no idea what you're talking about.

481
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,600
Someone I care about is in trouble,

482
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,660
And this club has something to do with it.

483
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,350
Now knowing my father was a member,

484
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,470
It only stands to reason that his closest friends were, too.

485
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,030
When I go to the authorities,

486
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,800
I'll have to suggest they investigate everyone.

487
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,290
I'm sorry about your friend, but I don't know anything that could help.

488
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,190
Have a good evening.

489
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,410
Mr. campbell, please.

490
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,540
I care about her.

491
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,230
I can't say anything.

492
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:50,860
Eastview  Hotel  10:30p.m.

493
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,990
The great uta hagen used to tell actors,

494
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,160
"give birth to the new person you are to become."

495
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:14,100
Well, with act one behind you and act two looming, my friends,

496
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:14,660
You are still in labor.

497
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:18,360
I feel like I'm in labor.

498
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,490
Remember, being onstage...

499
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,230
Is like standing on the edge of a cliff.

500
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,760
What saves you is the love and trust you have in each other.

501
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,990
Also, my friend, the renowned "new york times" theater critic,

502
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,770
Charles isherwood, is in the audience, and if you embarrass me,

503
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,090
I will kill you. now go.

504
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:40,800
Mr. isherwood, thank you so much for coming.

505
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:41,430
Thank you.

506
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:44,800
- Are you enjoying the show?  - yes. yes.

507
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,340
- What happened to you? you were supposed to come by and get me.  - I'm sorry.

508
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,130
You stood me up and your only explanation is "sorry"?

509
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,900
Nate, what is going on?

510
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,190
Nate, I told you.

511
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,190
Your character went bankrupt, suffered total public humiliation.

512
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:04,460
Not that you would understand that.

513
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:08,530
The characters in this play are smoldering tempests of emotion.

514
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:12,650
You're... as empty as...

515
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:15,280
The federal reserve.

516
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,210
Nate, wait.

517
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,280
No. I gotta go work on my smoldering tempest of emotion.

518
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,650
Don't you think that was a little harsh?

519
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,480
Directors push buttons to get performances.

520
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,410
Put your camera on a tripod. come watch the show.

521
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,110
what a pretty carriage.

522
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:46,910
Every time I see you, you happen to me all over again.

523
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:49,910
Ellen, you might be the most honest woman I've ever met.

524
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,510
What the hell are you doing?

525
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,880
Oh, no, but one of the least fussy.

526
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,480
You're trying to ruin my life. you're insane.

527
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,950
You must know that this can't last.

528
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,280
What can't?

529
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,250
Our being together...

530
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,010
And not being together.

531
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:12,780
Don't try to gaslight me, humphrey.

532
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,100
I know you're just seeking revenge

533
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,090
Because I ruined your chances with the simpy iowa

534
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:16,370
Teacher.

535
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,120
And incredible as it may seem,

536
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,880
not everyone spends their lives trying to plot revenge.

537
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,050
You ought not to have come today.

538
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,880
I look forward to seeing you.

539
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,880
Every thought is burnt up in a great flame.

540
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:33,880
Someone is out to get me, and all signs point to you.

541
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,080
You're the only one who knew it all. it has to be you.

542
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,330
Six or seven days passed,

543
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,250
and archer heard nothing from madam olenska.

544
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:13,210
Then one day, the newland archers received an invitation

545
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,280
To dine at mrs.Mingott's.

546
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,710
May, what a pretty gown.

547
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,680
Oh, thank you. how are you feeling, granny?

548
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,850
People tell me I'm old and ill, but I feel perfectly fine.

549
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,510
Hey. here.

550
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:27,250
That charm will prove useful when "beu-fort" arrives.

551
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,850
I want him to feel welcomed. uh, beau-beaufort.

552
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,580
Oh. right. beaufort.

553
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,210
Granny?

554
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,380
My child, your beauty never wanes.

555
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,110
Ellen, it's been too long.

556
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,950
Much too long, cousin.

557
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:47,950
It was--it was really great of julian to let vanessa film it.

558
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:51,180
I guess she says he's an amazing director. is that right?

559
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,580
Nate, that's your cue. go, go! okay. sorry.

560
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,980
Beaufort, so, so good of you to come.

561
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,950
Uh, they say you've been abroad.

562
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:03,350
Well, yes. I've--i've been, um...

563
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,850
I've been, um, you...

564
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:09,250
Uh, they--they say you've been abroad, right?

565
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,950
Yes. I've, um... he's always had trouble with this line.

566
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,780
I...

567
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,780
You know what? whatever. y-y-you want feelings?

568
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,870
Well, i-i-i hate these clothes,

569
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,640
I hate this play and I hate pretentious

570
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,550
Asshats who try and steal other people's girlfriends.

571
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,030
In fact,

572
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:31,810
I might just spontaneously punch one next time you get in my face.

573
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,120
I know just how mr.

574
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,520
Beaufort feels-- working so hard for something

575
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,510
And losing it because people are out to destroy you.

576
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,360
Well, countess,

577
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:44,650
At least you don't have to go through your whole life

578
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:48,180
Worried your best friend will humiliate and betray you.

579
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,580
I hate this fat suit. oh, and there's one other thing.

580
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,470
My whole family lost all of our money

581
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,980
Before my father went to jail for embezzlement.

582
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,410
So I think I know more about humiliation andbankruptcy...

583
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:02,250
All right, all right. than some lame dilettante director. okay?

584
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,180
Oh, what amusing companions. no, stop.

585
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,160
Oh... my... god.

586
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,450
why don't we retire to the parlor, uh, for some port?

587
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,710
No. I'm damned with van der luyden.

588
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,980
all right.

589
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:18,480
Shakespeare says, "all's well that ends well,"

590
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,510
And then sometimes it just ends.

591
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,200
Nate had already ruined everything.

592
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,900
You high school idiots turned my play into a travesty,

593
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,350
Embarrassed me professionally.

594
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,870
julian, it's charles isherwood.

595
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,200
Charles. please, i-i can explain. explain what? I loved it.

596
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,530
The classic interpretation of the first act juxtaposed with the radical

597
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,000
Deconstruction of the second act--genius.

598
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,030
really? you--you thought it was genius?

599
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:52,750
Yeah, I did.

600
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,280
The repressed characters melding with the actual kids

601
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:01,000
Aggressively expressing their feelings-- how did you come up with it?

602
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,770
well,as soon as I saw all that raw, adolescent emotion,

603
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:08,430
I-i-i knew I had to use it, harness it, spin it into gold.

604
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,870
Well, congratulations.

605
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,970
I look forward to seeing what you do next.

606
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,540
G--that's great. thank you for coming. thanks.

607
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,000
Wow. that was a whole new level of fake.

608
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,370
I'm going to look for my boyfriend. good job.

609
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,270
You know, I don't know why I ever had a crush on you.

610
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,100
Serena...

611
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,030
I'm gay.

612
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:49,230
Nate, wh-- what happened up there?

613
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,200
I know you're into him, and I get it.

614
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,030
I mean, he's older, he's smarter, and you guys like the same stuff.

615
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,070
I can't compete. you what?

616
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:03,530
I came to the gallery today and heard you on the phone.

617
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,430
Oh, my god. are you talking about julian?

618
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,270
I was talking to serena. she was with him.

619
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,370
She's the one who likes him, not me.

620
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:14,200
This is a total misunderstanding.

621
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,970
Well, you know, that doesn't change the facts.

622
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:27,400
All right? I mean, we have nothing in common.

623
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,870
I like espn, okay, and you like...

624
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,700
Books and movies.

625
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,830
The way you say that...

626
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,300
You didn't even bother to read "age of innocence."

627
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,970
You didn't watch the dvd I gave you.

628
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:41,210
You're like a kid who swears he hates

629
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,870
Tomatoes and has never even tried one.

630
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:49,830
Maybe you should be with a guy like julian who already likes tomatoes.

631
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:55,200
Maybe if you would put in some effort, you wouldn't be so insecure.

632
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,170
Elle.

633
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:08,770
Chuck. how did you-- escape? turns out they didn't want to hurt me.

634
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,800
They just wanted me to sign an agreement.

635
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,010
They gave me some cash and told me to get out of town.

636
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,220
that's great.

637
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:14,970
Sao paolo awaits.

638
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:15,760
Sao paolo? brazil.

639
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,350
I can still help you get settled,

640
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,930
and we can make a plan together.

641
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,710
Chuck, I am really grateful that you were willing to help me,

642
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,000
But all I needed was someone to give me money.

643
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,320
Now I have more than enough,

644
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,700
and I've already made a plan...

645
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,200
By myself.

646
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,230
So you were just using me?

647
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,730
You've got a good heart.

648
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:43,370
You should give it to somebody who cares.

649
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,500
Hi. that was some performance.

650
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,500
It was nothing compared to yours. what do you mean?

651
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,300
You called yale, sent the blast in to "gossip girl"

652
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,300
To get revenge on blair.

653
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,070
I believed in you.

654
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,930
All your talk about integrity and ideals.

655
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:08,450
My ideals?

656
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,290
Blair spread false rumors, blackmailed the school,

657
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,270
Turned my job into a sham with no repercussions.

658
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,270
You're just as bad as she is.

659
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,200
No, you're--you're worse.

660
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,330
Blair is a high schooler. you're an adult.

661
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,870
You need to fix things with blair.

662
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,700
absolutely not.

663
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:32,730
You know how you felt when your ideals were crushed?

664
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:35,470
Well, congratulations. you've crushed mine.

665
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,370
Hey, blair.

666
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,590
It's--it's rachel who's been messing with you,

667
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,410
And we had sex in the costume closet,

668
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:45,940
So you can do whatever you want with that.

669
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,040
Student sex in the costume closet-- is

670
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,970
That what they mean by heartland values?

671
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,370
I at least expected a denial.

672
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:11,400
No. I don't deny it.

673
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,470
Well, the headmistress told me my fate at yale is sealed.

674
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:22,600
So the question is, how do I make your fate as bleak as mine?

675
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,570
I don't know what's happened to me.

676
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:27,170
I... don't know what I've become.

677
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,570
I'm...

678
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:32,300
So sorry.

679
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:48,430
Well, your punishment is...

680
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,370
Just...

681
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,600
Live with it.

682
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,670
I should know.

683
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,330
It's not easy.

684
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,270
Serena.

685
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,280
So just so you know,

686
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,030
Blair isn't responsible for--for sending out that blast about yale.

687
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,200
I am.

688
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,800
You?

689
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,610
Yeah, well, I told rachel about yale wanting to put out the press release,

690
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,350
And she sent it in to "gossip girl."

691
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,170
but w-why would you do that?

692
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:29,010
I was trying to explain to her that you aren't like the other

693
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,160
Girls here and-- i-i gotta go find blair.

694
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,600
thank you for telling me.

695
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:46,700
I'm... so sorry.

696
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,650
And I get it if you don't want to talk to me right now,

697
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:52,590
but the fact is,

698
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,380
I come bearing snacks,

699
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,220
Hoping that we can cuddle on the couch and watch espn.

700
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,370
come here.

701
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,370
You're watching "the age of innocence"?

702
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,470
It's heartbreaking.

703
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,930
So are you.

704
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:29,530
I am a way better beaufort.

705
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,270
I'm--i'm sorry.

706
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,700
I-i know you were just looking out for me.

707
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,740
And rachel--well, she, uh,

708
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:48,720
She turned out to be not who I thought she was

709
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,770
or at least not anymore.

710
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,970
I'm sorry, too, son.

711
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:59,270
Dad, you were right about this, but I think you...

712
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:02,170
Need to give me space to make my own mistakes.

713
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:05,730
Well...

714
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:08,200
Lucky for you, you'll be at yale soon.

715
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,800
You can make all the mistakes you want, with, god-willing,

716
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
Girls your own age.

717
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:27,930
b., I've been looking everywhere for you.

718
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:39,930
I know that was rachel that sent the "gossip girl" blast.

719
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,530
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

720
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,100
Why would you?

721
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,230
What do you mean?

722
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:51,200
Believe me.

723
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,000
Nine times out of ten, I would have sent the blast.

724
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,770
Like you said, betrayal's in my nature.

725
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,770
I didn't mean that.

726
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,370
Spare me, serena.

727
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:07,000
I don't need a stirring speech telling me what a good person I am.

728
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,830
I know I'm not.

729
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:13,600
Yale kicking me out is the karma I've earned.

730
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,430
Blair.

731
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,970
Could you please leave?

732
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,330
I want to be alone.

733
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,170
You're still my best friend.

734
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:49,680
In life, as in art, some endings are bittersweet,

735
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:52,630
Especially when it comes to love.

736
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,090
So I know I sucked at the role of messenger,

737
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:57,550
but I found this by the door,

738
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,570
So I thought I'd try again.

739
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:01,970
Thanks.

740
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,770
Dan, I am going back to iowa, as you must have known.

741
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,770
I am sorry for everything.

742
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:15,710
As edith wharton wrote, "there is no one as kind as you,

743
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,840
"no one who gave me reasons I

744
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,730
Understood for doing what at first seemed so hard."

745
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:24,800
Thank you. r.

746
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,620
Sometimes fate throws two lovers together,

747
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:32,730
only to rip them apart.

748
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,200
Miss blair is out, mr. chuck.

749
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,970
I'll wait.

750
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:53,840
Sometimes the hero finally makes the

751
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,070
Right choice but the timing is all wrong.

752
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:04,000
And as they say, timing is everything.

753
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:17,270
Hello, beautiful.

754
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,670
Carter.

755
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,830
What are you doing here?

756
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:31,370
Buying you a drink.

757
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,030
Looks like this story might just have a second act.

758
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,670
Let's hope it's not a tragedy.

759
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:58,300
X.o.x.o., gossip girl.
