11
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,550
Gossip Girl Here

12
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:02,790
Your one and the only source

13
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,400
Into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.

14
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,620
I was willing to do what was necessary.

15
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,930
Including lying to Chuck.

16
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,680
I am K.C.. I am Olivia's publicist.

17
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,250
I am actually looking for a job.

18
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,730
Have you ever thought publicity?

19
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,130
How could 've you never heard of Olivia Brook

20
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,450
That "endless knights" series...

21
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,450
It's King Arthur with vampires.

22
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,330
She plays Guinevere.

23
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,540
My father turned his first profit by the time he was 22.

24
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,220
I hope to do it by the time I'm 21.

25
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,220
The manager of the inn wants to meet you.

26
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,060
Horace Rogers, meet Chuck Bass.

27
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,920
Man, come here.

28
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,760
Constance is gonna be so different.

29
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,960
There's no more hierarchy, no more mean girls.

30
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,760
We're here to make sure you get exactly

31
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,070
What you want this year.

32
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,510
You need to be cold to be queen.

33
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,600
Go make sure my spot's free at the met steps,

34
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,370
And wait there with a yogurt for me.

35
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,130
All Hallows' eve...The one day of the year

36
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,730
It's socially acceptable to play dress-up.

37
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,440
The only question is...who do you want to be?

38
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,180
There are costumes to make men feel like boys again

39
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,010
Or turn little girls into queens.

40
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,210
Jenny, please let me go through this closet.

41
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,080
There's no room for your new things.

42
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,270
Does this even fit you anymore?

43
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,450
Yes.

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,690
Perfectly. All of it does.

45
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,820
We're 183 on Travelocity,

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,160
Right behind the Holiday Inn LaGuardia.

47
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,000
Who needs travel sites,

48
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,450
With their huddled masses

49
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,870
Searching the internet late night, trolling for deals?

50
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,770
Without those masses

51
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm at less than 20% occupancy for the holidays.

52
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,550
That's why you should open the club.

53
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,760
Once that's the place to be seen,

54
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,520
You'll be so booked, you can turn away

55
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,790
The tasteless tourists in fanny packs.

56
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,090
I was thinking an '80s theme.

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,630
Although shoulder pads can be overwhelming

58
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,890
On my delicate frame.

59
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,790
This is a business, not a high school party.

60
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,170
I told you I was sorry for my little transgression,

61
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,670
And you forgave me.

62
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,020
Now either make me kiss a girl already

63
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,110
Or let's move on.

64
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,550
I apologize. I've been on edge lately.

65
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,280
With all my liquid assets tied up in this hotel,

66
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,310
I have to make sure everything gets done right.

67
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,020
"Right" for the Chuck Bass I know means "right now."

68
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,640
People think I'm playing a game,

69
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,610
And they want me to lose.

70
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,310
I have to prove I'm not just Bart Bass' son.

71
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,840
My impulsive tendencies have no place

72
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,990
In my life as a legitimate businessman.

73
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,460
Well, you're very sexy when you're legitimate.

74
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,030
Thank you.

75
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,840
I'm late to meet my accountant.

76
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,110
You understand I have to do this my own way.

77
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,390
Of course.

78
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,800
Mark? I want to book you for the opening of a new club.

79
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,160
All right, so I gotta ask.

80
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,160
Did you bring it?

81
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,260
Yeah. I got it.

82
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,040
Are you 100% sure you want to do this?

83
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,610
Yeah, you know, I mean,

84
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,980
Olivia and I have been dating for a couple weeks now.

85
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,770
It's getting pretty serious at this point.

86
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,840
I've waited so long, it's embarrassing.

87
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,310
Yeah, sure, but once you go there, you can't go back.

88
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,420
Believe me, I... I know.

89
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,530
I know. I...I...I really think I'm ready.

90
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,670
Oh. Enjoy, man.

91
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,490
Six hours of pleasure.

92
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,890
So you really think the sight of Olivia in fake fangs

93
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,260
Reciting stilted dialogue is gonna be a deal breaker,

94
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,400
Don't you? Oh, the dialogue's awesome.

95
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,250
It's the, uh, it's the part without the talking.

96
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,090
That's the problem.

97
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,550
I think I can handle some PG-13 bloodsucking. Come on.

98
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,000
Seriously, man, do you not get internet here in Brooklyn?

99
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,710
Okay. Patrick Roberts, who plays her vampire costar,

100
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,940
Was her boyfriend the whole time they were shooting this.

101
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,340
All the blogs said they got really into it

102
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,760
And started doing it for real,

103
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,570
Like sex-tape- On-the-cutting-room-floor real.

104
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,250
I think the most disturbing part in all this

105
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,870
Is that you've been reading "endless knights" blogs.

106
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,340
Okay, that's...I know you think you're okay with it,

107
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,080
But you don't want to  watch your girlfriend with another guy.

108
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,230
I mean, comparing looks and noises...

109
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,490
No, see, that's the problem with your theory.

110
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,330
I don't...I don't...I have no idea if she makes noises yet.

111
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,730
We haven't gotten to the noises stage,

112
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,160
Although we, uh, we do have plans tomorrow night, so...

113
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,430
Hold on a second. Maybe this is her.

114
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,590
Spotted...one star with her hand in the cookie jar.

115
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,790
Even perez hilton knows our lonely boy

116
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,710
Is going to be getting a halloween treat.

117
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,050
What the hell is this?

118
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,370
It looks like olivia's picking up some free...

119
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,360
I know what she's doing. I want to know why.

120
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,940
I assume it's because she wants to practice safe sex.

121
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,020
She shouldn't be practicing anything

122
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,200
Without patrick roberts, who's in toronto on a movie.

123
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,790
This obviously means you didn't take care

124
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,100
Of the dan humphrey situation like I asked you to.

125
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,480
It's not a situation.

126
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,500
It's a relationship.

127
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,150
They're very happy together.

128
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,980
Well, since I'm not a couples counselor,

129
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,660
Their happiness is irrelevant.

130
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,230
Serena, without "endless knights,"

131
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,560
Patrick is on the road to Mark Hamill-hood.

132
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,240
Is that the guy from "star wars" that's not Harrison Ford?

133
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,850
Not dating olivia is the nail

134
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,210
In patrick's culturally relevant coffin.

135
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,480
I'm not being ironic about vampire movies.

136
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,650
I'm sorry about patrick, but I told you,

137
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,320
If you want dan and olivia to break up,

138
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,060
That's something you're gonna have to do yourself.

139
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,440
Look, olivia's trying

140
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,860
To be a "real" girl and not taking my calls,

141
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,970
So I suggest you make yourself useful.

142
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,460
Unless, of course, you see yourself delivering

143
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,170
James Franco's underwear for the rest of your life.

144
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,730
He needs them by noon. I'll be in my office.

145
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,720
So rufu
