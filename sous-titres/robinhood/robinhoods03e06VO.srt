1
00:00:17,846 --> 00:00:20,839
No! No! No! No!

2
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,280
Do you love me, Gisborne?

3
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:37,613
Yes, sire.

4
00:00:38,636 --> 00:00:40,112
I'm so pleased to hear it,

5
00:00:40,232 --> 00:00:42,960
because I don't think
the Sheriff loves his Prince.

6
00:00:44,956 --> 00:00:47,106
No, I don't think he does at all.

7
00:00:50,381 --> 00:00:52,531
My time is almost here, Gisborne.

8
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:56,085
You know my father, Henry,
God rest his soul,

9
00:00:56,205 --> 00:00:59,005
wanted me to be King,
not my brother Richard?

10
00:01:00,325 --> 00:01:01,839
Me, King.

11
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:04,271
That was his wish.

12
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:07,231
And I will be, soon.

13
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,933
My father taught me
to surround myself

14
00:01:12,053 --> 00:01:15,240
with only those most loyal,
with only those who love me.

15
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,850
You'd make a fine Sheriff, Gisborne.

16
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:22,732
I'm confident of that.

17
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:28,760
Does it please you that I have
such confidence in you?

18
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:30,673
Yes, sire.

19
00:01:35,235 --> 00:01:36,839
Robin Hood isn't dead.

20
00:01:38,845 --> 00:01:40,995
I told you, I told the Sheriff...

21
00:01:41,615 --> 00:01:43,160
I wanted Robin Hood dead.

22
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:45,880
His blood is a gift I covet,
and yet no one gives it me.

23
00:01:46,196 --> 00:01:48,346
If the Sheriff loved Prince John,

24
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,920
he would give it me,
and yet I do not have it,

25
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:55,695
<i>ergo</i>... he doesn't love me.

26
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,790
Well, I will have blood,

27
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,580
the Sheriff's blood.

28
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,880
You will kill the Sheriff for me,
Gisborne...

29
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:15,746
discreetly.

30
00:02:16,362 --> 00:02:20,320
Only the two of us will know -
a private secret we can share.

31
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,319
And you will do this for me,
Gisborne...

32
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:27,874
because you love me.

33
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:37,680
The Sub Wood Team
Kiry and Moochie

34
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,560
www.sub-way.fr
www.seriessub.com

35
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,079
- Wait!
- All right.

36
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:18,282
Prince John and his soldiers
have made camp, down there!

37
00:03:18,402 --> 00:03:20,223
What? How many men has he got?

38
00:03:20,343 --> 00:03:21,666
- Thousands.
- No!

39
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:23,332
- Hundreds.
- Much!

40
00:03:23,685 --> 00:03:26,600
I didn't stop and actually count them!
I can't actually count.

41
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:28,791
Run! Run!

42
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,636
What are they doing in the forest?

43
00:03:38,756 --> 00:03:41,249
- Well, it's obvious, isn't it?
- Yeah, all right.

44
00:03:41,369 --> 00:03:44,296
When they break camp, they'll use
the North Road to get to Nottingham.

45
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,600
Why is he coming?

46
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,513
He's visiting all the nobles throughout
England to grease their palms.

47
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:51,511
He's trying to buy their loyalty
before King Richard returns, isn't he?

48
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:54,160
- What, he thinks it can be bought?
- He knows it can.

49
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,661
He's buying the nobles and their men
to seize the throne

50
00:03:56,781 --> 00:03:59,400
so that King Richard
returns to King John's England.

51
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:02,000
Every noble he buys
will bring us closer to civil war,

52
00:04:02,672 --> 00:04:06,640
and a war between Prince John and King
Richard will tear this country apart.

53
00:04:06,801 --> 00:04:10,039
If he's going to buy them,
he'll be carrying gold.

54
00:04:13,116 --> 00:04:14,566
More than a little.

55
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,780
Well...

56
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,959
we stop him stealing the crown
by stealing his gold.

57
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:25,840
This is mad...

58
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,960
Yes, it is. Utterly mad!

59
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,830
- He'll have a small army with him.
- Right.

60
00:04:31,826 --> 00:04:35,160
Our only advantage is surprise.
The best place to launch an attack

61
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,652
is here,

62
00:04:36,772 --> 00:04:39,120
outside Locksley. So you're going
to have to find more men.

63
00:04:40,109 --> 00:04:41,319
Let's do it.

64
00:04:44,044 --> 00:04:45,329
Gisborne?

65
00:04:54,197 --> 00:04:55,199
Gisborne!

66
00:04:55,626 --> 00:04:56,626
My lord.

67
00:04:57,487 --> 00:04:59,480
You're here.
I've been looking for you.

68
00:05:00,642 --> 00:05:03,292
I've been thinking
about our relationship.

69
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,330
We should work on it,
don't you think?

70
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:10,264
It's been a little strained
in the past,

71
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:12,239
I admit...

72
00:05:14,073 --> 00:05:17,257
but in the light
of Prince John's visit, well...

73
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,759
I think unity...

74
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:22,440
is the best way forward.

75
00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:26,442
Unity between you and me,

76
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,880
Standing strong, together,
don't you think?

77
00:05:35,774 --> 00:05:37,324
The past is the past.

78
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,880
We should leave it behind us.

79
00:05:41,738 --> 00:05:44,738
The man is a tyrant, Gisborne,
we both know that,

80
00:05:45,231 --> 00:05:46,400
and he's dangerous.

81
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,760
The only way
we're going to survive is...

82
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320
... unity.

83
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:05,640
I hope I'm not interrupting.

84
00:06:06,425 --> 00:06:07,425
No.

85
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,113
Not at all. Me and your brother
were just having a nice little...

86
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:12,781
philosophical chat.

87
00:06:12,901 --> 00:06:14,600
Yeah, about the past...

88
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:16,393
and the future.

89
00:06:17,106 --> 00:06:18,960
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, yes.

90
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:22,004
You've been invited to the...
nobles' supper, tomorrow evening

91
00:06:22,124 --> 00:06:23,774
with Prince John, so...

92
00:06:23,904 --> 00:06:26,160
try and make yourself
a little entertaining.

93
00:06:28,593 --> 00:06:29,593
Unity.

94
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:43,165
We need your help and you know us.

95
00:06:43,753 --> 00:06:46,400
We fight for England
and we fight for King Richard.

96
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,560
We must stop Prince John, we must!

97
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:51,033
So let's steal his gold,
thwart his ambition!

98
00:06:51,153 --> 00:06:53,177
He's a pretender and not our King.

99
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:55,634
This is not treason. Help us!

100
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:15,400
Good shot. Look out!

101
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:01,040
Hello.

102
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,360
Good God! We've captured
Prince John!

103
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
Come here!

104
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,040
I'd be very grateful
if you might spare my life.

105
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,480
The gold!

106
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:14,013
Let's go.

107
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:16,039
This has to be the gold!

108
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:19,999
Nothing.

109
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,800
Absolutely nothing!

110
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,760
Well, Prince John is a coward.

111
00:08:26,087 --> 00:08:29,080
If this were Prince John,
his soldiers wouldn't desert him.

112
00:08:29,604 --> 00:08:31,680
He'd try and buy our allegiance.
This is his double!

113
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,195
Where's Kate?

114
00:08:35,972 --> 00:08:36,972
Kate!

115
00:08:42,213 --> 00:08:43,907
Kate! Kate!

116
00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:45,773
Kate.

117
00:08:46,574 --> 00:08:48,078
I'll be all right.

118
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,080
Kate!

119
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:51,772
Kate!

120
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,159
Lay her down. Come on,
give her some space.

121
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:15,602
What is it?

122
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:19,640
If I remove it, the bleeding could
kill her, could cause more damage.

123
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:24,806
I need the bark of an elm tree
and some nettles to grind. Go, please.

124
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:28,840
A poultice? Quite effective.

125
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,040
It draws out the evils
while keeping the wound clean.

126
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,330
- What are you doing?
- To leave it in would kill her.

127
00:09:38,683 --> 00:09:41,760
I shall will the blood back into her
body while you prepare the poultice,

128
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,280
then we'll need to rebalance
her humours.

129
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,909
- Who are you?
- Benjamin Palmer,

130
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:48,400
physician to Prince John.

131
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:55,284
But neither his supporter,
nor his apologist.

132
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,800
Two soldiers reported seeing
assassins in the forest.

133
00:10:04,716 --> 00:10:07,190
The Prince needed a double,
he couldn't cancel

134
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,240
his dinner with the council of nobles
tomorrow. And there was no one else.

135
00:10:10,646 --> 00:10:13,360
I could have refused,
but I'd have been beheaded.

136
00:10:14,902 --> 00:10:16,523
Mind you, my predecessor
was beheaded

137
00:10:16,643 --> 00:10:19,087
because he couldn't find
a case of scrofula.

138
00:10:19,207 --> 00:10:21,472
- And what's scrofula?
- It's a very rare disease.

139
00:10:21,592 --> 00:10:23,360
So rare, I can't find a case,
either.

140
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:25,480
Legend says it's {\can only be }cured
by the touch of a king.

141
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,480
So why would he want
to find a case of it?

142
00:10:27,845 --> 00:10:29,540
Prince John's obsessed with it.

143
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,888
He once saw his father, Henry,
successfully cure a child with scrofula.

144
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,690
- My father told me{\ that} when I was a kid.
- I heard it, as well.

145
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,261
Prince John brought me with him,

146
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:41,380
hoping I might find a case of scrofula
for him to cure, like his father did,

147
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,040
to prove that he's the rightful King
of England, not his brother Richard.

148
00:10:45,973 --> 00:10:49,959
Of course there's absolutely no evidence
that a king's touch cures anything.

149
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,079
But as I'd like to keep my head,
I... I'll not be the one to tell him.

150
00:10:56,486 --> 00:10:57,600
{\Can I have }Some water, please?

151
00:10:57,761 --> 00:10:59,561
- I'll get it.
- I'll go.

152
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:04,821
Here you go.

153
00:11:05,761 --> 00:11:06,761
Here.

154
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:13,227
You're all right.

155
00:11:13,957 --> 00:11:14,959
Thank you.

156
00:11:16,436 --> 00:11:20,120
Thank you for helping to save
Kate's life. You're free to go.

157
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,800
- Yes, I'm really grateful.
- VERY grateful.

158
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:26,760
Well, thank you all.
Thank you for not killing me.

159
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,800
So... will you go back
to Prince John?

160
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,360
Well, I suppose I should.

161
00:11:31,803 --> 00:11:32,803
Right.

162
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:34,679
Tie him up.

163
00:11:57,406 --> 00:11:59,480
Welcome to Nottingham,
Your Highness.

164
00:11:59,758 --> 00:12:01,160
You're still alive.

165
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,960
Yes, of course.

166
00:12:04,677 --> 00:12:06,194
How surprising.

167
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:09,720
I don't particularly like surprises.

168
00:12:12,207 --> 00:12:14,680
- What's your name?
- Isabella.

169
00:12:15,512 --> 00:12:17,920
Lovely! Italian or Spanish?

170
00:12:18,314 --> 00:12:19,520
Which do you prefer?

171
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:35,000
Speak!

172
00:12:35,298 --> 00:12:38,680
Congratulations! We were
ambushed, not you. Your...

173
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,120
Your plan worked, Your Highness.
Your brilliance is unsurpassed.

174
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:44,639
- Who attacked you?
- Robin Hood.

175
00:12:48,076 --> 00:12:49,079
Sir Guy.

176
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:54,511
Prove your loyalty to me.
Rid me of him!

177
00:13:23,764 --> 00:13:25,799
Do you love me, Sheriff?

178
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,240
With all my heart, sire.

179
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,480
Would you give your life for me?

180
00:13:34,936 --> 00:13:36,840
My life? Is that all? Of course.

181
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:40,359
- Would you take a life for me?
- Even easier to answer.

182
00:13:43,162 --> 00:13:45,799
Gisborne has so disappointed me.

183
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,719
Disappointed us both, sire.

184
00:13:50,947 --> 00:13:53,200
Obedience, loyalty, love,

185
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:55,370
is it too much to ask?

186
00:13:55,785 --> 00:13:57,985
A king requires all three.

187
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:02,040
Who is more loyal to me, Sheriff...

188
00:14:02,938 --> 00:14:04,918
- you or Gisborne?
- Of course, I am, sire.

189
00:14:05,038 --> 00:14:06,640
My loyalty is infinite.

190
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,322
Good. Then prove it to me.

191
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:13,200
Rid me of Gisborne, Sheriff,
quickly, discreetly.

192
00:14:13,447 --> 00:14:17,347
We don't want to disturb our noble
guests with this messy business.

193
00:14:18,564 --> 00:14:20,778
Kill him for me, Sheriff.

194
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,397
A privilege, sire.

195
00:14:53,838 --> 00:14:55,321
And where were you attacked?

196
00:14:55,441 --> 00:14:57,240
- Near a village.
- Locksley village.

197
00:14:57,609 --> 00:15:01,244
We fought courageously,
but we were dreadfully outnumbered.

198
00:15:01,364 --> 00:15:04,322
No doubt the villagers
helped the outlaws.

199
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:08,271
And eventually, I was captured.

200
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:11,729
- By Robin Hood himself.
- Or so he said.

201
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I mean, we've all been proved wrong
in the past, haven't we, Gisborne?

202
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:21,280
- But this time, Robin Hood was fooled.
- Yes, Your Highness.

203
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:25,480
Excellent. And was he angry
that I'd made such a fool of him?

204
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,120
Very angry.

205
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,520
- And did he curse us?
- Fulsomely.

206
00:15:29,681 --> 00:15:30,830
Wonderful!

207
00:15:38,222 --> 00:15:39,480
What did he say?

208
00:15:41,635 --> 00:15:43,880
Oh. I... I couldn't, Your Highness.

209
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:47,160
- Please. Tell me exactly what he said.
- But Your Highness...

210
00:15:47,527 --> 00:15:50,343
- Do you not love me?
- Of course.

211
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:52,035
Then say.

212
00:15:55,543 --> 00:15:57,040
He called you a coward.

213
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,978
He said only a coward
would have a double.

214
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:11,683
Arrest him.

215
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:15,120
With pleasure. {\And }What shall I
charge him with?

216
00:16:15,813 --> 00:16:18,040
Impersonating the Prince Regent.

217
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:20,960
If it makes any difference, sire,
I didn't agree with him.

218
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:25,600
Where is this village of Locksley?

219
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,630
I want to see it.

220
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:44,320
These villagers helped attack me?

221
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:46,833
Why? They look so lovely.

222
00:16:49,662 --> 00:16:52,396
- Looks like a wedding.
- I love weddings!

223
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:57,964
I shall speak with them.
You'll join me?

224
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,299
They are sad little creatures,
really, aren't they?

225
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,395
I sense disagreement.

226
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:14,999
- One cannot disagree with one's King.
- King?

227
00:17:15,943 --> 00:17:18,843
You see me as your King?
How delightful of you.

228
00:17:19,387 --> 00:17:21,560
I wish others accepted me
as readily as you do.

229
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:25,200
Perhaps I've had the good fortune
to know you better than most.

230
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,320
Perhaps.

231
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:30,742
And perhaps you would like
to get to know me better still?

232
00:17:31,412 --> 00:17:33,712
You'll make me work for my conquest!

233
00:17:33,832 --> 00:17:37,080
Was not France more valuable
because it was fought for?

234
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
You make this such good sport!

235
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,466
Hello, young man. Thank you.

236
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:48,504
Would His Highness
give us his blessing?

237
00:17:48,624 --> 00:17:52,274
They would be honoured
if you would bless the bride and groom.

238
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,581
Of course!

239
00:17:59,971 --> 00:18:02,480
<i>- Are you the bride and groom?
- Yes, sir.</i>

240
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:05,217
- Your Highness.
- I wish you prosperity and happiness.

241
00:18:05,337 --> 00:18:08,920
- Thank you, sir.
- {\And I'm }So glad I could bring you sun today!

242
00:18:28,193 --> 00:18:32,160
Wait until they're all inside the church
and then burn it to the ground.

243
00:18:36,396 --> 00:18:37,399
Burn it!

244
00:19:24,983 --> 00:19:26,160
I'll be fine.

245
00:19:27,797 --> 00:19:29,120
You're being very brave.

246
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:33,002
We're already too late.
The gold is in the castle.

247
00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:35,736
- Then we'll steal it back.
- It's dangerous.

248
00:19:35,856 --> 00:19:37,824
It's too dangerous not to.

249
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,400
Prince John's burning Locksley!

250
00:19:51,586 --> 00:19:52,979
You're being punished...

251
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:55,249
for intolerable disloyalty to me,

252
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:58,512
for harbouring and assisting
Robin Hood and his outlaws.

253
00:19:58,632 --> 00:20:00,559
And may God forgive you!

254
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:13,040
<i>- To the river, quick!
- More buckets!</i>

255
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,920
<i>We need more water here!</i>

256
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:16,509
<i>Bring more water!</i>

257
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,840
<i>No, no, no, no, no!</i>

258
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,700
They're trying to put the fire out!
That's not what I want!

259
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:26,079
Stop them, the both of you! Go on!

260
00:20:29,954 --> 00:20:31,280
This should be entertaining.

261
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:34,074
<i>Come on, hurry up! Get the buckets!</i>

262
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:35,341
<i>Faster!</i>

263
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:37,644
<i>Bring more water, quickly!</i>

264
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,999
<i>Coming! I've got two here!</i>

265
00:20:42,396 --> 00:20:43,960
Do you want them to love you?

266
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:46,560
Of course.
And I think they do love me.

267
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,960
But I will have respect
as well as love.

268
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,400
Any landowner can subjugate his serf.
Only a king can liberate them.

269
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:56,397
- A benevolent king is loved.
- But I am benevolent.

270
00:21:01,942 --> 00:21:04,511
<i>Everyone over here, quick.
It's spreading.</i>

271
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:07,140
<i>We need more help! Come on!</i>

272
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:10,479
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

273
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:13,919
Go, peasant!

274
00:21:35,013 --> 00:21:37,040
Back off and your lives
will be spared!

275
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,900
I'll kill you, Gisborne!

276
00:21:48,398 --> 00:21:49,448
Oh, bother.

277
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,679
Back off!

278
00:22:14,085 --> 00:22:15,240
Bored now.

279
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:18,151
Make sure it's burned to the ground.

280
00:22:22,943 --> 00:22:25,493
I love the refusal
before the surrender.

281
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,319
Come on!

282
00:22:58,385 --> 00:23:00,439
<i>Come on! Come on, let's go!</i>

283
00:23:02,829 --> 00:23:05,235
- Take this.
- You're a Gisborne.

284
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,080
You should be burning it down,
not trying to save it.

285
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
I judge people by what I find.

286
00:23:49,211 --> 00:23:51,791
Isabella. Here.

287
00:23:55,673 --> 00:23:56,680
Well...

288
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:00,875
there's nothing about you
that resembles your brother, is there?

289
00:24:00,995 --> 00:24:03,489
There's nothing about my brother
I wish to be.

290
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:04,679
I hate him.

291
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,456
I will always hate him.

292
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:11,786
Well, that's something we share,
then, isn't it? Hatred.

293
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:16,200
That's nothing to be proud of, is it?
To share hatred?

294
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,863
- Robin!
- I'll catch you up.

295
00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:27,401
Right.

296
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,820
- Come on, let's go.
- So...

297
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:34,586
... will you go back to Nottingham?

298
00:24:35,192 --> 00:24:36,642
To ruin my brother.

299
00:24:36,912 --> 00:24:39,877
Right. Well, you know where I am
if you need my help, eh?

300
00:24:39,997 --> 00:24:42,640
You're Robin Hood. Shouldn't you be
robbing me, not helping me?

301
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:47,958
Yeah, you're right. I am.

302
00:24:49,892 --> 00:24:51,492
Give me your necklace.

303
00:24:51,793 --> 00:24:53,243
You're robbing me?!

304
00:24:59,858 --> 00:25:01,702
I like this necklace.

305
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:05,011
Are you going to help me?

306
00:25:05,131 --> 00:25:07,160
Help you?
This is not the way to go about it.

307
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,330
- Give me your rings.
- There.

308
00:25:12,258 --> 00:25:15,040
Because you don't want Prince John
to think you co-operated, do you?

309
00:25:15,743 --> 00:25:17,764
Anything else you might want?

310
00:25:18,464 --> 00:25:22,160
I want to undermine Prince John's claim
to be the legitimate King of England

311
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:26,795
and humiliate his ambition,
and I'm prepared to die to stop him.

312
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:30,320
- You might be more effective alive.
- Will you help me?

313
00:25:32,123 --> 00:25:33,128
Yes.

314
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Give this to the people of Locksley.

315
00:25:44,266 --> 00:25:45,960
Help them rebuild their church.

316
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:50,458
- So you defy Prince John?
- He begs my defiance.

317
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
So...

318
00:25:57,797 --> 00:25:59,397
is there anything else

319
00:26:00,676 --> 00:26:02,040
that I might steal?

320
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,877
Perhaps.

321
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,130
Stop, thief.

322
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,080
It's nice.

323
00:26:42,438 --> 00:26:44,435
She said she can help us.

324
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:47,492
Look, I can get you into the castle.

325
00:26:47,612 --> 00:26:50,162
You want us to trust her
with our lives?

326
00:26:50,374 --> 00:26:52,800
- Gisborne's sister?!
- Yes!

327
00:26:54,499 --> 00:26:56,315
I trust her with mine.

328
00:26:56,751 --> 00:26:59,851
All right, so she gets us in the castle.
Then what?

329
00:26:59,975 --> 00:27:02,280
Then we get captured and,
I presume, killed.

330
00:27:05,453 --> 00:27:08,475
- The king's evil!
- The PRINCE, Tuck.

331
00:27:08,681 --> 00:27:11,771
- The PRINCE is evil.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

332
00:27:11,891 --> 00:27:14,560
Prince John is searching
for a victim of scrofula.

333
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,720
So that he can repeat that same feat,
prove his divine right to the throne.

334
00:27:19,881 --> 00:27:21,800
We give him a victim.
I can make a potion

335
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:25,840
which brings out red blisters on the
neck which looks exactly like scrofula.

336
00:27:26,001 --> 00:27:29,134
So the nobles all assemble
in the great hall,

337
00:27:29,624 --> 00:27:32,467
in comes Prince John with this victim,
he touches him...

338
00:27:32,587 --> 00:27:34,520
- Fails.
- ... then we humiliate him.

339
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:37,341
Which distracts the nobles
while we steal the gold!

340
00:27:37,461 --> 00:27:38,760
That might work.

341
00:27:39,894 --> 00:27:42,115
Right. Isabella can get us in.

342
00:27:42,485 --> 00:27:45,675
And Allan, you know the castle
better than anyone.

343
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:48,535
- You can get us out.
- There's a trap door in the cloisters.

344
00:27:48,655 --> 00:27:51,960
If we lower a rope down, we can get
into a tunnel that leads directly out.

345
00:27:52,121 --> 00:27:54,555
- We won't even be seen.
- So come on, what do we think?

346
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:56,719
Can we convince Prince John?

347
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:01,712
Benjamin Palmer, the physician.

348
00:28:02,255 --> 00:28:04,960
We helped him. He owes us.
He'll convince Prince John.

349
00:28:05,982 --> 00:28:09,058
Isabella, you should know him.
If he's part of the Prince's entourage,

350
00:28:09,178 --> 00:28:12,795
- you can get to him.
- No, he's due to be executed tomorrow.

351
00:28:13,095 --> 00:28:16,506
Well, there's no reason why
he shouldn't help us, then, is there?

352
00:28:16,626 --> 00:28:18,719
I won't fail you.

353
00:28:21,006 --> 00:28:22,137
Any of you.

354
00:28:25,545 --> 00:28:27,635
We, er... still need a victim.

355
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:29,960
- I'll do it.
- No.

356
00:28:30,121 --> 00:28:32,040
You can't. You're not well enough.

357
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:34,680
- I'll be fine.
- Kate, it's too dangerous.

358
00:28:34,841 --> 00:28:36,480
He set fire to our church.

359
00:28:37,035 --> 00:28:40,067
He intended to kill everyone.
Besides...

360
00:28:41,677 --> 00:28:43,627
... I already look half dead.

361
00:28:44,453 --> 00:28:45,603
It's perfect.

362
00:28:50,127 --> 00:28:51,869
<i>Send for the groom!</i>

363
00:29:03,513 --> 00:29:04,640
They are beasts!

364
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,595
Robin Hood and his outlaws -

365
00:29:06,715 --> 00:29:09,160
they've robbed me,
stole my jewellery.

366
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,493
Look at me! I was so scared.

367
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:15,720
- Lovely, isn't she?
<i>- You should have come with us.</i>

368
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,995
Her brother will be dead
before supper, yes?

369
00:29:18,115 --> 00:29:21,117
Well, I wouldn't set a place
for him myself, sire.

370
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:23,182
Have her brought to me.

371
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:31,056
... then I took the sword in my hand
and tugged it from its sheath.

372
00:29:36,801 --> 00:29:40,492
And I put the sword
to the soft part of his throat.

373
00:29:41,473 --> 00:29:42,479
And?

374
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:45,428
Dozens of outlaws
appeared from nowhere...

375
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,120
... and I shouted,

376
00:29:48,642 --> 00:29:51,006
"Long live King John!"

377
00:29:53,211 --> 00:29:56,319
Oh, you adorable girl.
Everyone, leave us!

378
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,741
You spoke to them, the villagers,

379
00:30:13,861 --> 00:30:16,511
- as you tried to put out the fire?
- Yes.

380
00:30:17,211 --> 00:30:20,511
Why do the people not love me
as you love me, Isabella?

381
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,130
You burned their church to the ground
with them in it.

382
00:30:24,998 --> 00:30:26,091
Yes. And?

383
00:30:28,387 --> 00:30:31,040
The people want to love you
as their King.

384
00:30:32,556 --> 00:30:35,258
If you can prove
your divine right to the nobles,

385
00:30:35,378 --> 00:30:37,200
then the people will follow.

386
00:30:37,507 --> 00:30:39,337
- Do you think?
- Yes...

387
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,526
King John.

388
00:30:44,154 --> 00:30:45,680
Oh, you adorable girl.

389
00:30:48,707 --> 00:30:49,857
Say it again.

390
00:30:50,858 --> 00:30:52,770
KING John.

391
00:30:54,706 --> 00:30:56,203
It does sound good.

392
00:30:58,271 --> 00:30:59,909
It is my divine right.

393
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,781
You must prove it to everyone.

394
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:14,755
- You are going to help me.
- Am I?

395
00:31:15,197 --> 00:31:17,480
The Sheriff is going to execute you.

396
00:31:17,641 --> 00:31:19,906
This is your last chance
to save yourself.

397
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:22,000
- You've convinced me.
<i>- Where is he?!</i>

398
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:25,560
Our prayers
have been answered, sire.

399
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,280
Has he really found a victim
of the disease? Really?

400
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,624
He saw a woman in Locksley.

401
00:31:31,621 --> 00:31:33,471
I couldn't believe my ears.

402
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:36,355
- Is it true?
- Yes.

403
00:31:36,655 --> 00:31:38,275
This is so exciting!

404
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,362
I saw the poor, pitiful woman
when Robin Hood held me captive.

405
00:31:42,921 --> 00:31:44,557
I was sure it was scrofula.

406
00:31:44,677 --> 00:31:46,280
Why didn't you tell me?

407
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:50,080
Because you put me...
Because the Sheriff put me in this cage.

408
00:31:50,771 --> 00:31:54,521
What does the Sheriff think he's doing?
The man is my physician!

409
00:31:54,986 --> 00:31:57,336
- Are you sure it's scrofula?
- Yes.

410
00:32:00,161 --> 00:32:02,319
Completely and utterly certain.

411
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,620
The nobles will have their proof
of my divine right to be King.

412
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,984
Physician, you will bring
this woman to me tonight.

413
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,320
In front of all the nobles...

414
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,298
... I will cure her
and prove myself their rightful King!

415
00:32:32,012 --> 00:32:34,280
He's given each of the nobles
a casket full of gold,

416
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,040
too much to carry on their person,
it will be in their rooms.

417
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,403
- There will be five trumpet fanfares.
- Five.

418
00:32:39,523 --> 00:32:42,120
On the fifth,
you have to be ready to escape.

419
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,995
- And I'll make a distraction.
- Five. Good.

420
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,710
Kate, drink this.
The marks will be gone by tomorrow.

421
00:32:50,517 --> 00:32:51,521
Kate?

422
00:33:17,481 --> 00:33:20,440
- Thank you for helping us.
- You're welcome.

423
00:33:22,382 --> 00:33:23,399
Kate,

424
00:33:24,111 --> 00:33:27,200
after the fifth blast,
be ready for my signal.

425
00:33:28,245 --> 00:33:31,839
You need to follow Kate, all right?
We'll escape together, don't worry.

426
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:34,600
- We won't leave you behind.
- Very optimistic.

427
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:55,816
Where's this trap door?

428
00:33:55,936 --> 00:33:58,386
- I think it's down here.
- You think?

429
00:33:58,555 --> 00:33:59,585
Yeah.

430
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:09,114
Was that the second fanfare?

431
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:11,039
Good luck.

432
00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:17,159
Bring the poor,
afflicted woman forward.

433
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:30,999
This woman has scrofula...

434
00:34:34,201 --> 00:34:35,459
... the king's evil,

435
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:38,948
and can only be cured
by the touch of a king!

436
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:49,085
I shall now lay my hands
upon this...

437
00:34:50,153 --> 00:34:51,253
young woman,

438
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,116
cure her of her affliction

439
00:34:55,363 --> 00:34:56,971
and save her life.

440
00:34:57,367 --> 00:34:58,958
When she is cured,

441
00:34:59,245 --> 00:35:02,645
Prince John will be revealed,
like his father before him,

442
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,800
to be the rightful King of England.

443
00:35:07,989 --> 00:35:11,320
I command you now, in the name of
all things holy, to leave this body now

444
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,417
and never to return!

445
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:32,599
Gisborne.

446
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,794
What are you doing here?

447
00:36:04,284 --> 00:36:06,400
You represent everything
loathsome in a man!

448
00:36:06,561 --> 00:36:10,040
I thought that's why you liked me.
I was always fond of you, Gisborne.

449
00:36:10,722 --> 00:36:13,074
Not overly fond... but fond.

450
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:41,099
Has the disease been cured?

451
00:36:47,846 --> 00:36:49,515
No, sire.

452
00:36:50,055 --> 00:36:51,915
The woman is not cured.

453
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:56,719
How can this be?

454
00:36:59,137 --> 00:37:00,400
How can this be?!

455
00:37:08,997 --> 00:37:11,725
Did Prince John put you up to this?

456
00:37:12,514 --> 00:37:14,760
He asked me to kill you.
Do you hear me, Gisborne?

457
00:37:15,418 --> 00:37:17,999
This is nothing but sport for him...

458
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:22,715
... putting us up
against each other.

459
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:24,799
Unity, Gisborne!

460
00:37:26,106 --> 00:37:27,956
This isn't for Prince John.

461
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,874
This is for me!

462
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:38,040
I will be rid of you.

463
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:43,395
Please, I beg you...
have mercy on me.

464
00:37:43,601 --> 00:37:46,795
You have no idea how much pleasure
this is going to give me.

465
00:37:46,915 --> 00:37:48,480
You're going to die slowly

466
00:37:48,764 --> 00:37:51,440
and I'm going to watch the venom
drain from your body as you die.

467
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:53,243
Gisborne, please,

468
00:37:54,201 --> 00:37:56,519
don't disgrace me. Kill me quickly.

469
00:38:13,437 --> 00:38:16,640
Humanity is a weakness, Gisborne.
It's always been your failing.

470
00:38:17,141 --> 00:38:18,955
I tried to teach you.

471
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,155
That's five. We'd better go.

472
00:38:23,527 --> 00:38:25,625
I order you to be cured!

473
00:38:28,986 --> 00:38:30,995
I order you to be cured!

474
00:38:32,512 --> 00:38:34,362
Oh, good Lord! It can't be!

475
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:36,119
What is it?

476
00:38:37,485 --> 00:38:39,560
- Robin Hood!
- Benjamin, the door!

477
00:38:39,721 --> 00:38:42,275
Get him! Get him!

478
00:38:43,092 --> 00:38:44,279
<i>After them!</i>

479
00:38:46,964 --> 00:38:48,480
- They're coming.
- Quick!

480
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:51,835
- Kate, come on! -
Take that. Down you go.

481
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:53,960
As quick as you can. You're next.

482
00:38:57,356 --> 00:38:59,781
You're the reason Marian is dead.
You poison everything!

483
00:38:59,901 --> 00:39:01,120
All this for a woman?

484
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,741
I've enjoyed your company.

485
00:39:36,008 --> 00:39:37,239
Gisborne...

486
00:39:52,674 --> 00:39:54,280
You know, I loved you like a son.

487
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,960
And you loved me like a father once.

488
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,749
I know you did.

489
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,080
You dropped something.

490
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,560
Gisborne...

491
00:40:37,748 --> 00:40:39,400
... don't trust him.

492
00:40:41,516 --> 00:40:42,680
Do you hear me?

493
00:40:45,999 --> 00:40:49,120
Nothing... is what it seems.

494
00:41:06,115 --> 00:41:09,286
I pray you will remember
my generosity

495
00:41:09,561 --> 00:41:11,261
and my gifts to you all.

496
00:41:13,206 --> 00:41:15,176
All I ask for in return

497
00:41:16,216 --> 00:41:17,648
is your loyalty

498
00:41:18,234 --> 00:41:19,434
and your love.

499
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:28,875
It wasn't scrofula.
It couldn't have been.

500
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,810
Of course not, sire.

501
00:41:34,044 --> 00:41:35,048
Say it.

502
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,040
Like you did before. Say it.

503
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,254
King John.

504
00:41:45,012 --> 00:41:46,595
It does sound good.

505
00:42:14,561 --> 00:42:16,328
It is with great sadness

506
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,520
that I must announce the death
of the Sheriff of Nottingham.

507
00:42:22,328 --> 00:42:26,028
He has been murdered
by the villainous Robin Hood.

508
00:42:26,964 --> 00:42:29,039
These outlaws must be stopped!

509
00:42:31,896 --> 00:42:33,778
Long live Prince John!

510
00:42:35,812 --> 00:42:37,925
<i>Long live Prince John!</i>

511
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:41,528
Long live me.

512
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,205
Tell me all about it.

513
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:00,155
Come on!

514
00:43:31,921 --> 00:43:35,280
Within the hour every well within
a ten-mile radius will be dry!

515
00:43:35,441 --> 00:43:36,880
Nothing. I'm sorry.

516
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:39,560
You like my water so much,
from now on, you pay for it!

517
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,594
My lords and ladies,
I give you, Sir Guy of Gisborne,

518
00:43:43,714 --> 00:43:46,155
the new Sheriff of Nottingham.

519
00:43:46,401 --> 00:43:48,582
You're a dead man walking, Gisborne!

520
00:43:48,702 --> 00:43:52,160
She's Gisborne's sister! You think
she doesn't have ulterior motives?!

521
00:43:52,321 --> 00:43:54,514
- Guy, what are you doing?
