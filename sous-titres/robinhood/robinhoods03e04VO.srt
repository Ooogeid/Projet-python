1
00:00:01,791 --> 00:00:05,027
Good news, Scrope?
Give me good news.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,449
Erm... yes, well, with the, uh...

3
00:00:08,664 --> 00:00:12,159
money you get from selling the...

4
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:15,440
winter food stores to the merchants,

5
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:19,417
you'll be back in profit by...

6
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:29,600
... six pence ha'penny.

7
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:35,373
Is this some kind of joke?

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,480
- I forgot, you don't do jokes.
- I'm not very good at them.

9
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,720
PATHETIC! I WANT MONEY!

10
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,080
Prince John will not wait
for his patronage!

11
00:00:48,363 --> 00:00:50,971
I must have a thousand crowns
or I'm finished.

12
00:00:52,817 --> 00:00:55,714
Where is Gisborne when I need him?
Gallivanting with Prince John?

13
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:57,280
Scheming against me?

14
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,563
The new tax collector comes today.

15
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:05,081
They say he's very good.
Ruthless Rufus.

16
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,437
Well... he better live up
to his name because...

17
00:01:12,132 --> 00:01:13,400
I WANT MONEY!

18
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:27,049
So, we're going to steal
the Sheriff's winter food store?

19
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:31,039
To feed the poor...

20
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:35,360
from those wagons
guarded by all those soldiers.

21
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:38,960
How, exactly?

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,373
By making that wagon disappear.

23
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:55,505
Home sweet home.

24
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,678
So what do you think?
Are you ready and willing

25
00:02:00,798 --> 00:02:02,800
- to help me on this one?
- Yes, Father.

26
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:07,490
Excuse me, a jug of ale, please.

27
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
Help!

28
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,040
Watch, come on! Faster!

29
00:02:52,775 --> 00:02:55,104
- Not bad!
- Thank you.

30
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:56,843
Lift!

31
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:10,298
Halt!

32
00:03:15,406 --> 00:03:16,934
Let him through.

33
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,794
What do you mean,
the wagon's disappeared?!

34
00:03:33,043 --> 00:03:35,640
Wagons and horses
do not just vanish!

35
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:38,760
Looks like you got played!

36
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,183
And I thought YOU,
the Sheriff of Nottingham,

37
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,079
would be untouchable by now.

38
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:50,305
- Do I know you?
- My name's Rufus.

39
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:52,915
Your new tax collector.

40
00:03:53,304 --> 00:03:55,187
Back in my home town,

41
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,457
and this time...
I've come to make Nottingham pay.

42
00:04:06,586 --> 00:04:10,400
The Sub Wood Team
Moochie

43
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:16,280
www.sub-way.fr
www.seriessub.com

44
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,040
All right, everybody! Listen up!

45
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:57,516
And listen well.

46
00:04:58,624 --> 00:05:00,323
You don't know me,

47
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:02,756
you don't know what I'm like,

48
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:06,120
so I'm going to give you
a little example

49
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:08,534
of the kind of tax collector I am.

50
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:11,884
And what happens
if you don't pay up.

51
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,360
We pay our taxes,
we don't need his example.

52
00:05:15,987 --> 00:05:18,280
I think I'm gonna be the one
who decides that.

53
00:05:21,323 --> 00:05:22,480
This yours?

54
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:26,185
- Yes.
- It's our livelihood.

55
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:28,624
Remember it fondly.

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Edmund!

57
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,874
- Let her go!
- I can't. Sorry.

58
00:05:32,994 --> 00:05:34,640
Don't apologise, Edmund.

59
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,757
Don't apologise?
You're just hurting an innocent woman.

60
00:05:38,183 --> 00:05:40,346
Learn something I've learnt!

61
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,167
If you're weak,

62
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,166
hope is pointless!

63
00:05:44,656 --> 00:05:47,557
The world is hard
on the little people!

64
00:05:50,482 --> 00:05:52,480
You'd agree with that,
wouldn't you, Sheriff?

65
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,488
The small exist to be stamped on.

66
00:05:54,608 --> 00:05:57,718
There is a pleasing logic
about what you say, yes.

67
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,708
It'll take us months to put right!

68
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:02,904
You don't say.

69
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:17,738
No! No!

70
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:24,673
Very good!

71
00:06:27,243 --> 00:06:29,962
You didn't need to do that!
You didn't have to destroy everything!

72
00:06:30,082 --> 00:06:32,635
- Kate, stop it.
- You wanna keep your mouth shut.

73
00:06:32,755 --> 00:06:34,483
No. I really don't.

74
00:06:38,283 --> 00:06:41,079
I tell you what I'm going to do,
just this once.

75
00:06:41,828 --> 00:06:43,242
I'll play nice.

76
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,685
I won't make you suffer
for disrespecting me.

77
00:06:49,095 --> 00:06:50,884
I'll make her suffer instead.

78
00:06:55,756 --> 00:06:57,040
Do you want her to live?

79
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:00,447
Yes.

80
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:03,951
Then you come with me
to Locksley Manor.

81
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,833
You make me smile.

82
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:08,594
You do that,

83
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,080
and I'll let your mother go.

84
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,157
So what's it gonna be, little lady?

85
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:17,956
Do we have a deal?

86
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:24,432
Yes.

87
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:28,440
Don't take her, please,
she's my daughter, take me instead.

88
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:32,400
So, Sheriff, how was this show,
did you get a kick out of it?

89
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,809
Very good.
You make Gisborne look all...

90
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,500
warm and snuggly.

91
00:07:38,203 --> 00:07:39,209
Good.

92
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:41,320
That's good.

93
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:46,040
I like him.

94
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,870
Did you see that man
watching us earlier?

95
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,243
With the kid?

96
00:07:52,524 --> 00:07:54,535
There's something
familiar about him.

97
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:56,080
It's like... I don't know...

98
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,509
I saw smoke!

99
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,266
I think Locksley's on fire!

100
00:08:05,163 --> 00:08:06,187
Nervous?

101
00:08:16,303 --> 00:08:18,370
I feel like some entertainment.

102
00:08:23,132 --> 00:08:24,329
Can you dance?

103
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:29,422
Dancing is pretty basic, so yes,

104
00:08:30,706 --> 00:08:32,252
I think I can manage it.

105
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,815
Good.

106
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,969
Edmund? Sit...

107
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,320
watch the girl dance.

108
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,561
I have to see to the horses.

109
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,040
Well, dance then.

110
00:09:02,215 --> 00:09:03,363
And smile.

111
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,030
We need more water and buckets.

112
00:09:10,124 --> 00:09:11,641
John, who did this?

113
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:13,871
It was the man we saw
this morning with his son.

114
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:16,000
Robin, he's the new tax collector.

115
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:17,880
Eh? Where's Gisborne?

116
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:22,240
It's Kate! She needs our help!

117
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,838
Well, I did what you wanted...

118
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,120
- so are we done now?
- Oh, no.

119
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,670
No, no, no, no, no.

120
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,800
We're not done yet.

121
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,579
Are you sure about that?

122
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,413
Robin!

123
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,280
Robin Hood, I assume.

124
00:10:06,443 --> 00:10:08,800
We meet again. Lucky you.

125
00:10:10,132 --> 00:10:12,499
Much!
What are you doing here?

126
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:15,984
- Saving a damsel in distress.
- I was doing fine on my own!

127
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:24,040
You're wasting your time!
Why do you help the weak, Robin?

128
00:10:25,197 --> 00:10:28,242
Haven't you worked it out yet?
Charity is pointless.

129
00:10:28,683 --> 00:10:31,245
Helping the innocent
is never pointless.

130
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,920
Hurt my son again, you'll suffer.

131
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:41,840
Who's going to make me suffer, you?!

132
00:10:42,404 --> 00:10:44,217
A man who bullies young girls?

133
00:10:45,408 --> 00:10:46,760
Now, you ask nicely,

134
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:50,005
you say "please"
and I won't kill you.

135
00:10:50,506 --> 00:10:53,213
You see, my father was the kind of man
who asked nicely.

136
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,712
And I watched him
get kicked around for it.

137
00:10:55,832 --> 00:10:57,742
So I don't ask nicely,

138
00:10:58,602 --> 00:11:00,641
and I don't get kicked around.

139
00:11:01,205 --> 00:11:04,214
Kill me if you want,
but I don't beg.

140
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,855
- The girl's coming with me.
- Take her.

141
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:10,119
Her sweet face isn't worth
this much trouble.

142
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,202
One other thing.

143
00:11:13,662 --> 00:11:17,440
I'll be telling my good friend
the Sheriff who your new friends are.

144
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:21,160
So you'd better keep your pretty face
hidden from now on.

145
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:24,280
You've just made it on
to Nottingham's Most Wanted list.

146
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:27,982
Come on.

147
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,084
Some knights in shining armour
you lot are,

148
00:11:38,204 --> 00:11:40,984
just swoop in
and now I have to leave home!

149
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,058
You were in trouble,
we're only trying to help!

150
00:11:44,178 --> 00:11:45,960
- Do I really have to do this?
- Kate,

151
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,840
Kate, he will tell the Sheriff
and you'll be hunted.

152
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,440
All right?

153
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,265
It's time to say goodbye.

154
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,081
<i>About face!</i>

155
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,992
I hear that
the Earl of Northumberland

156
00:11:58,112 --> 00:12:01,800
is having problems
on his borders with raiding Scots.

157
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,972
Northumberland, don't like him.

158
00:12:05,498 --> 00:12:06,600
Always so...

159
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,767
jolly.

160
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:11,588
No, the Celtic scum can have his land
as far as I'm concerned.

161
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,160
He's offering gold for troops.

162
00:12:19,077 --> 00:12:20,285
<i>Atten-tion!</i>

163
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:25,693
- That would leave me unprotected.
- Oh, just for a few short weeks.

164
00:12:26,553 --> 00:12:29,160
You could close down the castle
until they return.

165
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,880
Apparently, Northumberland
is willing to be generous.

166
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,720
Very generous!

167
00:12:40,746 --> 00:12:42,184
Very good, Scrope.

168
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:48,852
I won't be far away. I promise.

169
00:12:50,742 --> 00:12:53,074
And I'll visit whenever I can.

170
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:01,026
This isn't right.

171
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:07,360
First you get my son killed,
now you're taking my daughter.

172
00:13:09,646 --> 00:13:11,091
We'll look after her.

173
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,268
Yeah, you better had,

174
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:16,800
because if anything happens
I'll hold you responsible.

175
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,486
You're so angry we saved you, Kate,

176
00:14:09,954 --> 00:14:11,886
but seriously,
what were you going to do?

177
00:14:12,006 --> 00:14:14,857
- Stab the guy?
- Well, yeah, if I had to.

178
00:14:15,252 --> 00:14:17,240
He'd be no great loss to the world.

179
00:14:17,744 --> 00:14:18,905
We helped you.

180
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,972
We're giving you a bed for the night.
Are you not just slightly grateful?

181
00:14:22,092 --> 00:14:25,480
Oh, I'm SO grateful,
thank you for ruining everything!

182
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:28,160
I can really see why you guys
are so legendary!

183
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,360
Well, aren't you sweet and charming?

184
00:14:31,521 --> 00:14:32,960
Aren't you full of yourself?!

185
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,078
Full of myself?

186
00:14:35,806 --> 00:14:37,520
You've gone too far now, Kate.

187
00:14:37,863 --> 00:14:40,340
I'm wounded, truly,
my heart is broken.

188
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,545
I'm sure some drunken girl with no taste
will make it better.

189
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:46,320
- Funny you should say that...
- You all right, Kate?

190
00:14:48,126 --> 00:14:50,176
I'm having the time of my life.

191
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:55,362
What?!

192
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:02,040
- Did you hear that?
- Which bit,

193
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,662
Kate being sarcastic
or Kate being ungrateful?

194
00:15:04,782 --> 00:15:08,263
What she said about us!
"You guys are legendary." Plural.

195
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:11,030
Referring to all of us,
not just Robin.

196
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:13,726
She may have turned me down,

197
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,726
but she thinks I'm legendary.

198
00:15:25,346 --> 00:15:27,206
When do I get my money?

199
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:30,891
As soon as Northumberland
gets his troops. Three days, perhaps.

200
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:38,845
Rufus is collecting the money from
Northumberland's agent at Mansfield.

201
00:15:40,086 --> 00:15:42,040
Put the castle on lock-down.

202
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:44,430
Nobody goes in or out
without my say,

203
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,040
except Rufus,
when he brings me my money.

204
00:15:58,112 --> 00:15:59,526
<i>Just leave me alone!</i>

205
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,520
Next time you're late with taxes,
you stop breathing. Understood?

206
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,022
Grandfather's shop?

207
00:16:17,965 --> 00:16:19,760
Before it was taken from him.

208
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:25,608
- How old...?
- 17.

209
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,246
Same age you are now.

210
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:37,446
He used to make me breakfast
every morning.

211
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:41,686
Bring it up to the door in my room.

212
00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:45,496
He'd say, "Rufus!

213
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,630
"Eat it all up, don't go hungry!"

214
00:16:49,957 --> 00:16:52,160
He'd say the same thing every day.

215
00:16:54,107 --> 00:16:56,041
You didn't watch the girl dance.

216
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,661
- I told you, the horses.
- You didn't want to watch her.

217
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:03,131
The same way you don't ever want
to watch people suffer.

218
00:17:03,726 --> 00:17:05,354
What's wrong with that?

219
00:17:10,323 --> 00:17:11,338
One day,

220
00:17:12,006 --> 00:17:13,006
Edmund,

221
00:17:14,295 --> 00:17:16,279
I'll have made enough money
to set you up.

222
00:17:18,406 --> 00:17:20,069
Buy you prestige...

223
00:17:21,882 --> 00:17:22,909
respect.

224
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:27,413
But that means nothing
if you are WEAK!

225
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:33,280
So weak that someone can just turn up
and take it all from you!

226
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,657
I'm trying!

227
00:17:35,245 --> 00:17:37,840
When I look in your eyes,
do you know what I see?

228
00:17:38,337 --> 00:17:39,594
Uncertainty.

229
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:42,582
Like you don't even know
who you are.

230
00:17:42,702 --> 00:17:45,169
- Do you know who you are?
- Yes, Father!

231
00:17:49,246 --> 00:17:50,627
That's my boy.

232
00:17:56,536 --> 00:17:57,805
You still here?

233
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,520
- The butcher's is mine now.
- The shop is all I have.

234
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,680
Edmund!

235
00:18:05,994 --> 00:18:08,085
Hit him till he gets the message.

236
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,680
You've got to go, now, all right?
Believe me, it gets worse if you don't.

237
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,446
So what happens next
with Robin Hood?

238
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:25,964
Don't think about him.
He's a distraction.

239
00:18:27,862 --> 00:18:30,680
This matters. What we're doing here.

240
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,916
Home sweet home.

241
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,232
You can't run away.

242
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:42,329
Things stay with you. They stay with you
till you deal with them.

243
00:18:46,219 --> 00:18:49,720
The Sheriff's going to regret
what he did to my father.

244
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:06,881
Homesick?

245
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:11,438
No, it's fine.

246
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,886
I can handle it.

247
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,965
- I'm not just some stupid girl.
- I know you're not.

248
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:25,286
Maybe I'm a bit homesick.

249
00:19:28,093 --> 00:19:30,631
It gets easier, being an outlaw.

250
00:19:35,434 --> 00:19:38,080
Do you ever get used to
being apart from your family?

251
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:42,761
No. You don't get used to that.

252
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:48,711
That's what I thought.

253
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:51,441
Whatever happens,

254
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:53,958
you're not on your own, Kate.

255
00:19:58,342 --> 00:20:01,305
- Sounds like a good plan.
- Yep, we need to leave now.

256
00:20:02,824 --> 00:20:05,338
So, I know what we're going to do.

257
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:08,240
We're going to kidnap
the tax collector.

258
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:11,192
- Scare him silly.
- And get rid of him,

259
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,414
for good.

260
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:22,862
Taxes.

261
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:30,310
- Adding a little happy to your day?
- Yes,

262
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:34,665
oh, yes, very good... very good...
You have a distinct talent for this.

263
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:38,720
As long as you're happy, as long as
the Sheriff gets what he wants.

264
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:54,400
Did I ever tell you,
my father lived in Nottingham?

265
00:20:54,646 --> 00:20:56,108
He lived here his whole life.

266
00:20:56,228 --> 00:20:57,920
How very pleasant for him.

267
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,679
I don't respect him much,
but he was kind.

268
00:21:02,453 --> 00:21:04,760
Not a single day
when I don't think about him.

269
00:21:04,926 --> 00:21:06,135
How very moving.

270
00:21:06,255 --> 00:21:08,240
La-de-da-de-da...

271
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,079
He took the bait.

272
00:21:13,329 --> 00:21:14,792
Stupid Sheriff.

273
00:21:15,286 --> 00:21:18,886
By the time we're done,
that scum will be crying like a baby.

274
00:21:26,361 --> 00:21:29,853
Well, we just keep running
into each other, don't we? Eh?

275
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,200
Must be fate.

276
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
Father!

277
00:21:40,886 --> 00:21:43,966
- You can't do this!
- Who's going to stop us? You?

278
00:21:46,065 --> 00:21:47,322
Guards! Help!

279
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:53,050
You heard him, there'll be
guards on the way, come on!

280
00:21:57,761 --> 00:21:58,776
Ready?

281
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:02,230
Go! Quick, quick...

282
00:22:28,966 --> 00:22:30,076
This side...

283
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,200
Thank you, little lady.

284
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,410
- Let me in there, Much.
- I'm trying, I'm trying.

285
00:22:50,823 --> 00:22:53,808
- I'll get the horses.
- Take her away!

286
00:22:55,846 --> 00:22:56,915
Kate!

287
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,436
Stuff this!

288
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:02,640
Come on!

289
00:23:03,877 --> 00:23:06,644
- They've got Kate!
- No time! Robin!

290
00:23:06,764 --> 00:23:07,875
He's right.

291
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,440
This way, quick!

292
00:23:19,568 --> 00:23:20,571
Hello?

293
00:23:23,072 --> 00:23:25,386
How about a spot of kidnapping?
Brighten up the day.

294
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:27,400
- Get him on the horse.
- Come here, you!

295
00:23:31,506 --> 00:23:32,678
EDMUND!

296
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,321
Father!

297
00:23:37,414 --> 00:23:38,497
Follow me!

298
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,418
Halt! This way.

299
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,323
Father!

300
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:13,153
Gag him up, Tuck!

301
00:24:13,273 --> 00:24:15,256
- Come on!
- They're not giving up, Robin!

302
00:24:15,376 --> 00:24:18,046
We've got to go back for Kate...
and Allan.

303
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,589
We can't go back now.
If we live, they have a chance.

304
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,969
- Get in!
- Get down.

305
00:24:43,824 --> 00:24:45,240
They could be anywhere.

306
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,202
Search the area.

307
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,170
What now?

308
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:09,555
You can have your son back...
on one condition.

309
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,440
You let our two go.

310
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:18,206
You think you can play me that easy?

311
00:25:19,988 --> 00:25:22,634
I know you have some emotion,
however small.

312
00:25:23,646 --> 00:25:26,212
He's your son.
I know you want him back alive.

313
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,060
And you're Robin Hood.

314
00:25:28,255 --> 00:25:30,406
You don't kill unless you have to.

315
00:25:30,526 --> 00:25:33,041
ME, I'm not so sweet.

316
00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:39,526
I've hidden your friends
somewhere you're never gonna find.

317
00:25:40,276 --> 00:25:43,309
So you make sure
my son is back by midday.

318
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:45,983
And, if you're lucky,

319
00:25:46,103 --> 00:25:48,847
your friends
might still be breathing.

320
00:25:57,857 --> 00:25:58,880
Damn!

321
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:05,086
What now, Allan? What happens now?

322
00:26:05,206 --> 00:26:06,726
There's no way out.

323
00:26:06,846 --> 00:26:08,377
Yes, I can see that.

324
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,445
And then Rufus will come...

325
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,326
and we'll be dead.

326
00:26:21,486 --> 00:26:23,920
And how can I help my family
if I'm dead?

327
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,721
They need me!

328
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:38,771
I've been in worse.

329
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:40,848
If that helps?

330
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:43,720
It doesn't help!
It's just annoying...

331
00:26:45,031 --> 00:26:46,843
like you're showing off.

332
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,400
Look, this isn't fun for me either,
you know!

333
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,291
I mean, I'm stuck in here
with you, and...

334
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:58,000
well, you're not exactly
easy on the eye, are you?

335
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:02,800
- You don't think I'm pretty?
- Just a little plain for my taste.

336
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,098
- I think your neck's too long.
- My neck?!

337
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:08,539
My nose, maybe.

338
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:14,246
It's the first time
I've seen you smile.

339
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,360
I wouldn't do it, actually...
it's not your best look.

340
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:22,040
Do you know, looking at you actually
makes me want to be a little bit sick.

341
00:27:23,565 --> 00:27:25,080
Do you feel better yet?

342
00:27:26,514 --> 00:27:27,514
Yeah.

343
00:27:28,566 --> 00:27:31,043
- Insulting you definitely helps.
- Good!

344
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:34,384
Before we carry on though,
you may want to move.

345
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:36,945
I think you just sat down
on a pig kidney!

346
00:27:42,864 --> 00:27:44,000
I know this man!

347
00:27:47,086 --> 00:27:50,560
- What is your family name?
- I'm not telling you.

348
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,305
- You...
- Oi, back off, big man, back off!

349
00:27:53,934 --> 00:27:56,874
Course you're not going to tell us.
You've got to be loyal to your father.

350
00:27:56,994 --> 00:27:58,800
A lovely man, it's touching.

351
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,360
He's a good man.

352
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,480
He's the way he is because he had to be.
He never had any choice.

353
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,440
So where will he take them,
this good man?

354
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,199
- Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
- Even if you did,

355
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:10,680
we wouldn't believe you.

356
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,041
He's staying at Locksley,
so we'll start there.

357
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:17,481
Tuck, you stay with this boy.

358
00:28:18,086 --> 00:28:20,576
See if you can get
anything useful out of him.

359
00:28:20,696 --> 00:28:23,040
But don't hurt him...
unless you have to.

360
00:28:30,237 --> 00:28:33,737
You did well! Convincing the Sheriff
to part with his troops.

361
00:28:33,857 --> 00:28:36,446
Oh, thank you! Yes, yes...

362
00:28:36,566 --> 00:28:39,160
He wasn't sure at first,
but I told him!

363
00:28:39,321 --> 00:28:42,798
I said, "Sheriff, you need the money,"
and he listened.

364
00:28:43,258 --> 00:28:45,458
- He listened to ME!
- To you!

365
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:46,960
Good boy.

366
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,347
You keep me smiling

367
00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:52,160
and that sweet wife of yours
won't be touched, eh?

368
00:28:53,244 --> 00:28:54,694
Yes, um...

369
00:28:56,698 --> 00:28:58,184
but the Sheriff,

370
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,412
- won't he work it out?
- Probably.

371
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:07,040
Oh... you want him to work it out?

372
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,051
Sharp, aren't you, Scrope?
Nothing gets past you.

373
00:29:12,654 --> 00:29:14,800
You see, I want him
to come looking for me

374
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,462
and I want you to help him
to put the pieces together.

375
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:23,122
Actually,
I-I-I'd rather come with you.

376
00:29:23,873 --> 00:29:25,600
Let him work it out himself.

377
00:29:25,886 --> 00:29:28,765
Sorry,
you're no use to me if you tag along.

378
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:32,160
Play your part well, Scrope.

379
00:29:32,886 --> 00:29:34,355
Think of your wife.

380
00:29:35,408 --> 00:29:37,800
So what exactly is it
that he wants then, your father?

381
00:29:38,616 --> 00:29:40,000
He's just a tax collector.

382
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:49,864
Say it again, just for fun.

383
00:29:51,449 --> 00:29:53,040
He's just a tax collector.

384
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,307
You know, when people lie,
their pulse beats a little bit faster.

385
00:29:57,427 --> 00:29:59,977
And Edmund, you just lied.

386
00:30:02,706 --> 00:30:04,797
You were meant to be
one of the good guys.

387
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:07,160
Well, if I am,
what does that make your father?

388
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:11,320
- He's always been there for me.
- He's always tried to bully you, right?

389
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:15,628
- Tried to turn you into someone else?
- He wants me to be tough and brave.

390
00:30:15,748 --> 00:30:17,731
Violent and manipulative.

391
00:30:23,687 --> 00:30:25,912
But it's not what you want,
though, is it?

392
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:29,248
You know, you try and hide it,
but there's a kindness in you.

393
00:30:31,612 --> 00:30:34,053
Apparently,
I get that from my grandfather.

394
00:30:35,996 --> 00:30:38,246
And you think that's a flaw, right?

395
00:30:39,582 --> 00:30:41,240
My father says it is.

396
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,594
Well, it's not.

397
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:44,199
Trust me.

398
00:30:44,361 --> 00:30:46,245
Kindness is never a flaw.

399
00:30:51,777 --> 00:30:53,989
There's no-one inside.
The cellar's empty.

400
00:30:54,109 --> 00:30:55,649
The stables are clear.

401
00:30:57,201 --> 00:30:59,968
If we find out who he is,
that'll lead us to them.

402
00:31:00,088 --> 00:31:03,286
Much, go back inside,
see if you can find anything.

403
00:31:03,406 --> 00:31:05,435
John, ask around the village.

404
00:31:05,555 --> 00:31:08,589
If you recognised him,
someone else will have as well.

405
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:11,160
There's someone I need to talk to.

406
00:31:20,744 --> 00:31:24,330
Are you hungry?
Cos this thing is nearly ready.

407
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,037
If you give me food,
you will want something in return.

408
00:31:27,157 --> 00:31:28,800
That's how it normally works.

409
00:31:29,151 --> 00:31:31,800
But what I really want, Edmund,
is for you to think for yourself.

410
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,160
- I do think for myself.
- Well, that's not strictly true.

411
00:31:35,634 --> 00:31:38,937
And if it was true, then you never
act on those thoughts.

412
00:31:39,309 --> 00:31:42,659
You suppress them
and do what your father wants instead.

413
00:31:43,286 --> 00:31:45,960
- He wants me to grow up.
- But Edmund, you have a brain.

414
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,449
You know that's not
what he really means.

415
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:50,480
He means he wants you
to turn into him.

416
00:31:51,322 --> 00:31:54,192
What would you do, if you were me?

417
00:31:55,226 --> 00:31:57,523
I'd relax and eat some rabbit.

418
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:04,201
Scrope?

419
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:09,195
<i>In here, Sheriff. Help!</i>

420
00:32:18,845 --> 00:32:19,884
My money.

421
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,520
- Where is my money?
- It's not my fault.

422
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:24,608
He took it. Rufus.

423
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,048
I tried to stop him.

424
00:32:27,423 --> 00:32:29,133
How hard did you try?

425
00:32:29,597 --> 00:32:30,637
Really hard.

426
00:32:31,362 --> 00:32:34,976
I hit him in the face...
and I kicked him!

427
00:32:35,837 --> 00:32:38,213
Amazing.
It must have been such a fight.

428
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,550
Yet there's not one mark on you!
GUARDS!

429
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,930
GUARDS!

430
00:32:45,305 --> 00:32:46,330
GUARDS?!

431
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:52,880
Where are they all?
Northumberland, he cannot have them all.

432
00:32:53,068 --> 00:32:54,980
They're with Rufus,
at the butcher's.

433
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,574
He bribed them.

434
00:32:56,895 --> 00:32:59,326
You have to go there
if you want them back.

435
00:33:01,753 --> 00:33:05,234
How do you know he bribed them?

436
00:33:06,571 --> 00:33:08,106
I-I-I... saw him.

437
00:33:08,714 --> 00:33:09,970
Before I hit him.

438
00:33:10,219 --> 00:33:12,164
He was bribing them.

439
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:13,770
I only found out then.

440
00:33:15,152 --> 00:33:16,160
Scrope,

441
00:33:17,556 --> 00:33:18,801
you're lying.

442
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:21,040
Be honest, confess.

443
00:33:21,316 --> 00:33:24,953
I might find it in myself to be warm
and forgiving and let you live.

444
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:31,240
- R-R-Really?
- Oh, yes.

445
00:33:31,931 --> 00:33:35,750
Underneath this harsh surface,
I'm deeply sensitive.

446
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:39,035
Well, he made me lie.

447
00:33:39,304 --> 00:33:41,963
I didn't want to.
He threatened to hurt my wife!

448
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:45,360
Oh, Scrope, Scrope.

449
00:33:51,025 --> 00:33:52,210
I lied!

450
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:55,684
Underneath this harsh surface,
there's just

451
00:33:55,899 --> 00:33:58,655
more... harsh... surface.

452
00:34:06,951 --> 00:34:08,281
You're untying me?

453
00:34:09,135 --> 00:34:10,875
Well, you have to eat.

454
00:34:11,724 --> 00:34:14,124
And you're way too big
to spoon feed.

455
00:34:21,933 --> 00:34:23,020
Go ahead,

456
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:25,450
pick it up.

457
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:26,899
Stab me.

458
00:34:28,646 --> 00:34:31,376
Spend the rest of your life
wracked with guilt.

459
00:34:31,966 --> 00:34:33,400
I don't want to kill you.

460
00:34:40,126 --> 00:34:42,338
Family. That's important, right?

461
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,960
Doing things for people
who've been hurt.

462
00:34:45,246 --> 00:34:46,842
Who has been hurt?

463
00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:49,425
Your grandfather?

464
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:52,951
That's why your father's here,
isn't he?

465
00:34:53,071 --> 00:34:54,690
The Sheriff killed him.

466
00:34:55,006 --> 00:34:57,360
For no reason. Because he could.

467
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,507
Your grandfather was hurt
so your father hurts others.

468
00:35:00,627 --> 00:35:02,591
When it's going to stop, Edmund?

469
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,520
He's my father. I stick by him
because what choice do I have?

470
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:08,308
You always have choices.

471
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,899
I mean, take Robin Hood.

472
00:35:11,994 --> 00:35:14,837
He could have spent his entire life
lording it over the less fortunate.

473
00:35:14,957 --> 00:35:16,457
But he chose not to.

474
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,455
I'm going and find my friends now.

475
00:35:20,584 --> 00:35:22,480
See if I can be of some use.

476
00:35:23,806 --> 00:35:25,400
So, can I come with you?

477
00:35:27,446 --> 00:35:30,078
And where do you think
we should be going?

478
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,999
To the butcher's shop.

479
00:35:37,154 --> 00:35:38,157
Midday!

480
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:43,277
And there's no sign of my son.

481
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,120
It's no fun being you.

482
00:35:52,807 --> 00:35:55,907
- Your son will be safe.
- Robin wouldn't hurt him.

483
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:57,720
He's not like that.

484
00:35:58,006 --> 00:36:00,240
Robin isn't here to save you now.

485
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:02,454
Rebecca.

486
00:36:04,582 --> 00:36:07,920
No... Tell me she's all right, please.
Tell me she's all right.

487
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,795
She's been captured,

488
00:36:10,024 --> 00:36:13,560
by the new tax collector.
I am SO sorry.

489
00:36:14,892 --> 00:36:17,998
I can't lose her. She's my baby.

490
00:36:18,118 --> 00:36:20,042
I can't lose her, as well.

491
00:36:20,162 --> 00:36:22,053
Listen, we'll get her back.

492
00:36:22,374 --> 00:36:24,416
I promise. You have my word.

493
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,248
Robin?
Nothing, apart from this.

494
00:36:29,368 --> 00:36:31,680
- Oh, Much!
- Well, it's not Gisborne's!

495
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,604
Look at it.

496
00:36:35,169 --> 00:36:36,480
A butcher's hook!

497
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:40,200
Chauncey! That's the family name!
The old butcher.

498
00:36:40,614 --> 00:36:43,726
Now, the butcher,
he was a good man but his son...

499
00:36:43,846 --> 00:36:46,596
I remember him.
He was always angry.

500
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:49,880
- Yeah, always stealing, fighting.
- What else can you remember?

501
00:36:50,912 --> 00:36:53,800
Years ago, a girl in the village
got married. D'you remember, John?

502
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,600
Yes, the butcher came with his son.

503
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,120
Everyone had collected money
for the bride and groom,

504
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:01,827
but during the ceremony the son,
Rufus, that was his name,

505
00:37:01,947 --> 00:37:05,320
he was caught stealing it. After that,
his father and him disappeared.

506
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:08,640
Well, he'll go home,

507
00:37:09,529 --> 00:37:13,160
he won't be able to help himself.
He'll go home to the butcher's.

508
00:37:18,673 --> 00:37:20,050
He has them all!

509
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:34,080
He has ALL my men!

510
00:37:48,403 --> 00:37:49,455
No! Don't!

511
00:37:55,578 --> 00:37:57,120
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

512
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,319
Quick!

513
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:03,492
Allan, find all his money. Go, go!

514
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:10,339
- What do you want, Robin Hood?
- I want you gone.

515
00:38:12,996 --> 00:38:16,000
I can't go yet,
not till the Sheriff shows his face.

516
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,018
Robin!Robin, wait!

517
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:36,680
This man is a thief and a bully.

518
00:38:38,714 --> 00:38:41,360
Now, you tell me why I should wait.

519
00:38:41,521 --> 00:38:44,749
He only became a thief
because my grandfather was killed.

520
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,422
No, no, he stole before that.
Robbed a couple on their wedding day.

521
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:52,731
- No, that's not true.
- Just don't listen to him, Edmund.

522
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:56,379
How wonderful. I came to kill YOU...

523
00:38:59,343 --> 00:39:02,480
and Robin Hood is doing
my dirty work for me. Tremendous.

524
00:39:03,004 --> 00:39:05,280
This town took my father from me.

525
00:39:07,726 --> 00:39:09,966
YOU took my father from me.

526
00:39:10,646 --> 00:39:13,836
Remember Daniel Chauncey,
the old butcher?

527
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:20,080
Of course! Yes!

528
00:39:20,676 --> 00:39:23,661
My very first execution!

529
00:39:24,026 --> 00:39:25,416
Now, then! Mmm?

530
00:39:26,108 --> 00:39:28,151
Oh, yes, I thought
we've met somewhere before!

531
00:39:28,271 --> 00:39:31,135
But you see, Rufus,
your father had to die because he stole.

532
00:39:31,255 --> 00:39:32,600
And then he admitted it.

533
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:35,000
Sounds like
he was trying to protect his family.

534
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,033
You see,

535
00:39:44,353 --> 00:39:47,832
that's why your father
has got so many ISSUES.

536
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:53,018
HE... allowed HIS father

537
00:39:53,544 --> 00:39:55,236
to die for a crime

538
00:39:55,462 --> 00:39:57,840
- HE committed.
- No, it wasn't like that.

539
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:01,040
- It was YOU!
- Temper, temper!

540
00:40:06,326 --> 00:40:08,120
Robin! We found the money!

541
00:40:09,446 --> 00:40:10,446
Money?!

542
00:40:10,895 --> 00:40:12,889
MY money? MY taxes?!

543
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:15,520
YOU! Give me MY money!

544
00:40:19,025 --> 00:40:20,234
Get after them!

545
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,275
Grandfather wasn't weak.
He was strong - he died for you!

546
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,849
Shut up now!
Enough!

547
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:36,033
Stop it! The Sheriff did it, not me.

548
00:40:36,886 --> 00:40:39,080
We are leaving. Now!

549
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,816
- Can you get a clean shot?
- Too many people.

550
00:40:42,936 --> 00:40:44,151
You with me, son?

551
00:40:44,766 --> 00:40:47,488
All he did... was love you.

552
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:52,160
- Please! Enough!
- He loved you...

553
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,581
and it's your fault that he's dead.

554
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,200
Shut up.

555
00:40:59,302 --> 00:41:00,806
SHUT UP!

556
00:41:20,362 --> 00:41:21,886
Remember, son...

557
00:41:23,006 --> 00:41:25,940
the world is hard
on the little people.

558
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:49,461
Where will you go?

559
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:53,461
I don't know yet but, um,
I'm looking forward to finding out.

560
00:41:54,249 --> 00:41:56,040
I think you'll be all right.

561
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,784
I will now.

562
00:41:58,166 --> 00:41:59,332
But, um...

563
00:42:00,788 --> 00:42:01,800
thank you.

564
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,956
Thank you.

565
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:22,951
So, just the one night then?

566
00:42:23,763 --> 00:42:25,177
Yes, one night.

567
00:42:26,188 --> 00:42:28,170
I'll be out of your hair tomorrow.

568
00:42:29,457 --> 00:42:32,160
- Unless...
- Unless you wanted to stay, of course?

569
00:42:32,589 --> 00:42:35,308
Yeah, well,
if you guys wanted me to,

570
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:37,815
you know,
after everything that's happened,

571
00:42:37,935 --> 00:42:40,303
- well, it'd be rude to say no.
- We want you to stay.

572
00:42:40,423 --> 00:42:42,760
Do we? It's not as if
we need another girl around.

573
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,175
We've got Much.

574
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:45,295
Kate,

575
00:42:46,574 --> 00:42:47,880
I want you to stay.

576
00:42:48,668 --> 00:42:50,120
You're now one of us.

577
00:42:53,034 --> 00:42:55,760
- Thank you.
- Come on.

578
00:43:00,804 --> 00:43:02,702
Was that actual gratitude?

579
00:43:02,935 --> 00:43:05,013
Yes, but don't expect more of it.

580
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:07,205
Right now is just
a moment of weakness.

581
00:43:07,325 --> 00:43:09,542
Right, so you'll hate me again
in the morning.

582
00:43:09,662 --> 00:43:12,160
Yeah, maybe even more than before.

583
00:43:16,606 --> 00:43:18,128
I saw her first.

584
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,000
Looking well, Gisborne,
for a dead man.

585
00:43:29,161 --> 00:43:31,327
So Prince John sent you back
with a mission.

586
00:43:31,447 --> 00:43:33,000
He asked me to kill Robin Hood.

587
00:43:33,626 --> 00:43:35,480
- Tell me your name.
- Isabella.

588
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,332
Gladiators, ready?

589
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,288
We've got Prince John's
elite guards after us.

590
00:43:41,408 --> 00:43:43,800
It's time.
Get the weapon into position.

591
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:47,320
Isabella!?

592
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,960
There are hundreds of them.
We've been herded,

593
00:43:50,121 --> 00:43:52,160
like lambs to the slaughter.
