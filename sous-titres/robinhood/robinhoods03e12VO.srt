1
00:00:15,146 --> 00:00:17,000
I bet you can't do it with three.

2
00:00:33,986 --> 00:00:35,236
I'll take that.

3
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:38,320
Tie him up, then.

4
00:00:38,845 --> 00:00:40,941
It's from Isabella to Prince John.

5
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:44,280
"My Prince, I understand
the urgency of your request.

6
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:46,520
"Richard returns from the Crusades
within the month.

7
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:49,360
"Troops loyal to him await him
in Loughborough. We must be ready."

8
00:00:49,778 --> 00:00:52,960
- Richard. King Richard?
- The King's coming home.

9
00:00:54,586 --> 00:00:55,720
Read the rest.

10
00:00:56,962 --> 00:00:59,040
"You asked for 300 men,
food and supplies.

11
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:03,465
"I will dispatch them at sunset to join
with your northern forces in Doncaster."

12
00:01:04,639 --> 00:01:06,640
So, where has Isabella
got 300 men from?

13
00:01:07,473 --> 00:01:09,423
"England will soon be yours."

14
00:01:09,562 --> 00:01:11,160
You give the Sheriff this message.

15
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,321
Go on.

16
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:15,417
England will never be
a slave to Prince John,

17
00:01:15,537 --> 00:01:17,552
not while Robin Hood
fights for King Richard.

18
00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:18,480
<i>Robin!</i>

19
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,500
They've taken them!

20
00:01:24,663 --> 00:01:27,200
- They took them!
- Taken who?

21
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,880
I was in Clun.
The Sheriff's soldiers.

22
00:01:30,374 --> 00:01:32,440
- They've taken all the men.
- How many?

23
00:01:32,698 --> 00:01:35,093
I don't know.
Must have been at least 100.

24
00:01:35,213 --> 00:01:37,720
Robin! Same in Nettlestone.

25
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,440
The Sheriff's guard came
and just carted them off -

26
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,920
crops and livestock too.

27
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:44,745
100 from Clun, 100 from Nettlestone.

28
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:47,261
They'll go to Locksley next.

29
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:48,640
Get to Locksley!

30
00:01:50,905 --> 00:01:54,805
The Sub Wood Team

31
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,820
Episode twelve
SOMETHING WORTH FIGHTING FOR (part1)

32
00:02:36,815 --> 00:02:37,815
Hood!

33
00:02:42,393 --> 00:02:43,994
Come on, then!

34
00:02:55,565 --> 00:02:56,560
Pull back!

35
00:02:56,721 --> 00:02:58,760
<i>Get the supplies to the castle.</i>

36
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,040
Idiots!

37
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:07,600
<i>Get the prisoners out of there!</i>

38
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:09,519
John, break the chain!

39
00:03:23,853 --> 00:03:25,120
They're gone.

40
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:27,674
Let's get these men to Sherwood.

41
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,400
You are an imbecile.

42
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,373
Failure!

43
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,080
Blamire.

44
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,119
Tell me, are the men
of Locksley secured?

45
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:10,120
We had a situation -
some unforeseen difficulties.

46
00:04:10,831 --> 00:04:11,881
Robin Hood.

47
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:15,529
- There's a man here to see you.
- A man?

48
00:04:16,004 --> 00:04:18,767
Apparently, he has
a proposition for you.

49
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:20,341
Really?

50
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:25,080
The name's Archer.

51
00:04:27,793 --> 00:04:30,359
Archer? Archer what?

52
00:04:31,929 --> 00:04:32,960
Just Archer.

53
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:34,403
Archer.

54
00:04:35,572 --> 00:04:38,120
Weren't you due to hang in York?

55
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:41,240
Me? Hang? York?
Don't know anything about that.

56
00:04:41,553 --> 00:04:42,680
That's right.

57
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,111
He's the one Hood and Gisborne
broke out of prison.

58
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:48,131
Many of my men were injured.

59
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:51,720
I never asked them to do that.
They just turned up.

60
00:04:52,396 --> 00:04:53,480
Arrest him.

61
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:57,485
Robin Hood's a nut. He feels compelled
to go about saving people.

62
00:04:57,979 --> 00:04:59,420
Even so,

63
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:03,320
do you really think I would fraternise
with such a low-life as you?

64
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,352
- You would if you knew the truth.
- Wait.

65
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:10,719
The truth?

66
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:15,606
You and I...

67
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:21,320
- ... we're brother and sister.
- I'm sorry?!

68
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,428
Ghislaine is my mother too.
Impossible.

69
00:05:23,548 --> 00:05:25,683
She had me out of wedlock
and sent me away.

70
00:05:25,803 --> 00:05:28,953
How dare you stand there
and tell me such evil lies?

71
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,920
Is it a lie that she died
in a house fire?

72
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,679
Or that she was married
to a leper...

73
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,920
your father?

74
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,960
Is that a lie?

75
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,280
See, I've travelled far and wide.

76
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:49,360
I know the most exotic ways
to kill a man.

77
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:51,600
That's why Robin and Gisborne
saved me.

78
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:55,560
- They wanted to use me.
- Take him away.

79
00:05:55,992 --> 00:05:57,720
If we join forces, think about it.

80
00:05:58,021 --> 00:06:00,080
Your power, my skill.

81
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,160
We can be unstoppable.

82
00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:07,040
What I need are men
that can offer me

83
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,321
loyalty and protection.

84
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:11,160
Arrest him!

85
00:06:11,932 --> 00:06:14,399
Sister, don't forsake me.

86
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:19,007
- Lock him up.
- He must never be allowed

87
00:06:19,127 --> 00:06:20,627
to leave the castle.

88
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:22,644
Ever!

89
00:06:47,164 --> 00:06:49,646
We have to get the rest of
our supplies to Locksley.

90
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:51,975
That'll keep the women and children
alive until we return

91
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:54,495
- their crops and livestock.
- Robin?

92
00:06:55,204 --> 00:06:56,654
What about the men?

93
00:06:57,494 --> 00:06:59,840
- What about them?
- Well, when are they gonna fight?

94
00:07:00,785 --> 00:07:03,480
Tuck, these men are farmers.
They're not warriors.

95
00:07:03,762 --> 00:07:06,240
The Lord helps those
who help themselves, Robin.

96
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:09,772
Your protection weakens them.
We are failing in our mission.

97
00:07:09,892 --> 00:07:11,920
We're supposed to be inspiring
these men to stand up

98
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,503
and fight for themselves,
giving them real hope.

99
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:18,000
These men are terrified for their lives.
They've forgotten how to hope.

100
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:21,861
Then, my friend, it's time
we lit the flame in them again.

101
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,360
If I disappoint the Prince, I hang like
every other noble who's ever failed him.

102
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:36,640
- Blamire, I need those men.
- Tricky.

103
00:07:36,835 --> 00:07:38,840
Hood's protecting them
in the forest.

104
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,592
Then it's Hood I need to destroy.

105
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:44,033
I need to get to his weakness,

106
00:07:45,117 --> 00:07:46,640
exploit his vulnerabilities.

107
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,199
Which are?

108
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,780
His friends,

109
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,872
that odious little gang.

110
00:07:56,992 --> 00:07:59,560
The idiot cares about them.
That's his weakness.

111
00:08:02,412 --> 00:08:03,412
Blamire...

112
00:08:05,712 --> 00:08:08,480
Bring me Kate's mother
from Locksley.

113
00:08:16,072 --> 00:08:17,079
<i>Hurry up!</i>

114
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:20,783
Move!

115
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:24,088
This way.

116
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:33,266
Good.

117
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:35,760
Go, please, Blamire.
This is delicate.

118
00:08:45,373 --> 00:08:46,973
It's pretty, isn't it?

119
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:49,136
You know,

120
00:08:49,965 --> 00:08:53,609
sometimes the prettiest things
can be the most fragile.

121
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,199
Your daughter is an outlaw.

122
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,643
My daughter is dead to me.

123
00:09:01,763 --> 00:09:04,719
There's no point denying her.
Trust me on that.

124
00:09:08,113 --> 00:09:10,920
- What do you want with me?
- I want to help you.

125
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,000
- Help me?
- Yes.

126
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,600
A safe passage to Doncaster
for you and your family.

127
00:09:17,195 --> 00:09:18,720
It must be awful for you,

128
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:21,022
having a child living
out there in the wild

129
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:23,120
with those... savages.

130
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:26,080
- Well, Robin wouldn't hurt her.
- Wouldn't he?

131
00:09:30,652 --> 00:09:32,320
He still loves me.

132
00:09:38,865 --> 00:09:41,669
She'll never leave him.
She believes in him too much.

133
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,400
Oh, well, then, we must
shake her belief to the core.

134
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,440
Plant this on Robin, then persuade
Kate that he still loves me,

135
00:09:49,193 --> 00:09:51,539
his own true Isabella.

136
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,595
Then give her this.

137
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:57,925
When she finds the other half on him,
her faith will be shaken

138
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,080
and she'll realise that a candle
still burns deeply in his heart for me.

139
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:07,000
I can't.

140
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:10,179
Can't?

141
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:14,360
I don't think you understand,
you ignorant crone.

142
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,960
Every last morsel of food,

143
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:21,080
every animal, every grain of barley,
within a 50-mile radius

144
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,600
is locked up in my courtyard,
ready for transportation to the north.

145
00:10:25,998 --> 00:10:28,334
Hell is coming, Rebecca.

146
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:34,240
I think you should save your family
whilst you still can.

147
00:10:47,944 --> 00:10:49,794
This is everything we have.

148
00:10:51,306 --> 00:10:54,000
- Love you.
- I've got something to show you.

149
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,359
- Where did you get that?
- Isabella.

150
00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:05,800
Robin holds the other half.

151
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:09,295
Close to him.

152
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:12,922
It seems there's a...

153
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:16,201
a deep bond between them.

154
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,500
- I don't believe that.
- He loves her.

155
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,472
- I'm sorry.
- No.

156
00:11:25,438 --> 00:11:27,720
- Isabella's Robin's enemy.
- Check his things.

157
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,160
If he holds the other half,
then you'll know.

158
00:11:33,146 --> 00:11:34,680
I don't need to check his things.

159
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:38,162
Kate, don't waste the rest
of your life with him.

160
00:11:39,092 --> 00:11:41,280
Kate, you ready? We have to go.

161
00:11:42,308 --> 00:11:45,039
You belong here with us,
with your family.

162
00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:52,999
Robin?

163
00:12:05,086 --> 00:12:06,640
Take good care of her.

164
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:07,801
I will.

165
00:12:08,712 --> 00:12:10,000
I will. I promise.

166
00:12:12,493 --> 00:12:13,693
Come on, then.

167
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,272
What's that?

168
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,020
It's Isabella's.

169
00:12:27,798 --> 00:12:31,616
Our mother gave it to her when she
was a child. She worshipped her,

170
00:12:31,736 --> 00:12:33,555
and she cherished this.

171
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:39,480
She wouldn't give this to just anyone,
now, would she?

172
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,143
So, what's it doing here?

173
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:46,120
- You think this is mine?
- {\Well, }She's your sister, Guy.

174
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:48,925
Yeah, a sister that's betrayed me
many times, and tried to kill me.

175
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:50,774
If there's any doubt
about your loyalty...

176
00:12:50,894 --> 00:12:52,294
Well, there isn't.

177
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:55,793
Would I have told you
it was Isabella's if there was?

178
00:12:55,913 --> 00:12:58,640
Well, if it's not yours,
then whose is it?

179
00:13:15,846 --> 00:13:18,567
You haven't moved
from that spot in ten years.

180
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:21,040
- They let you out?
- Not exactly.

181
00:13:21,782 --> 00:13:22,840
Need a drink?

182
00:13:24,218 --> 00:13:26,239
I need money, fast.

183
00:13:30,704 --> 00:13:33,560
I'm a wanted man.
I need safe passage out of England.

184
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:35,400
I need information I can sell.

185
00:13:37,127 --> 00:13:38,840
What sort of information?

186
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:42,640
I need to prove my loyalty
to the Sheriff, show I can protect her.

187
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:46,222
We take the castle.

188
00:13:49,273 --> 00:13:51,323
We claim it under King Richard.

189
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:54,640
We put Isabella under house arrest.

190
00:13:55,985 --> 00:13:59,331
We release the supplies.
We release the men.

191
00:14:00,691 --> 00:14:03,080
And we hold that castle
till King Richard returns.

192
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:05,241
If I can penetrate the castle,

193
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,040
I open her eyes
to what I'm capable of achieving.

194
00:14:08,558 --> 00:14:09,808
But the castle,

195
00:14:10,378 --> 00:14:12,843
it's bursting with men,
crops, livestock.

196
00:14:12,963 --> 00:14:15,600
It's defended by an army of guards.

197
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:18,920
- We can't take a castle.
- We can if we go down the tunnel.

198
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,575
I'm tired of looking
over my shoulder.

199
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,000
I need enough so I can leave England...
forever.

200
00:14:28,771 --> 00:14:29,771
Well...

201
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:34,272
there is... one way in.

202
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:39,920
When the old Sheriff returned from
his failed mission in the Holy Land,

203
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,459
he became paranoid
about repercussions.

204
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:44,560
So he built himself an escape route.

205
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,720
- A tunnel.
- Who dug this tunnel?

206
00:14:47,881 --> 00:14:51,360
Their rotting bodies
were found underground.

207
00:14:51,806 --> 00:14:53,600
Gisborne locked them in,

208
00:14:54,222 --> 00:14:55,440
the whole force.

209
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:59,495
The diggers were silenced.
I made sure of that.

210
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:03,440
So no one else knows about the tunnel,
especially not Isabella.

211
00:15:04,852 --> 00:15:07,602
It starts here, in a derelict churchyard
outside the west gate,

212
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:10,320
and it leads directly
into the heart of the castle.

213
00:15:11,713 --> 00:15:13,760
I say we go down the tunnel,
we seize Isabella

214
00:15:13,921 --> 00:15:15,627
and we force her
to dismiss her guards.

215
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:18,000
We take Isabella,
we take the castle.

216
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:25,720
Now, that's everything I have.

217
00:15:26,512 --> 00:15:29,800
The opening is
in a derelict churchyard,

218
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:33,159
under the grave
with the fallen cross.

219
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:45,015
If we time the break-in to coincide
with the supply train leaving,

220
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,520
most of the guards will be
busy with the convoy anyway.

221
00:15:49,253 --> 00:15:50,681
Count me out.

222
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:52,720
I don't trust him.

223
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,960
- How do we know that this isn't a trap?
- Cos we want the same thing.

224
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,360
Since when have you cared
about our people?!

225
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,160
I don't. I just want Isabella.

226
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,400
She betrayed me to Prince John.
I{\ intend to}'ll make her pay.

227
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:05,360
Now, that sounds more like
the Gisborne we all know and loathe.

228
00:16:05,521 --> 00:16:08,000
That's enough!
We go through the tunnel.

229
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,089
And that's my final word!

230
00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:13,920
Gisborne is one of us now.
Our fate is his.

231
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,421
Tuck, John, get some forging tools
to make weapons.

232
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,480
The rest of you,
get whatever money we have

233
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:21,991
and melt it down to make arrowheads.

234
00:16:27,132 --> 00:16:29,188
Kate, listen.

235
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:34,720
Gisborne's loyal.
I'd stake my life on it.

236
00:16:34,946 --> 00:16:36,360
He killed my brother.

237
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:39,880
I will never, never trust him.

238
00:16:40,557 --> 00:16:42,360
- Well, you can trust me.
- Can I?

239
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,280
What? What do you mean?

240
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:48,061
I've left my family.
I'm not there with them.

241
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:51,280
I'm here... with you.

242
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:54,040
And you're helping, Kate.
You're making a difference.

243
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:57,520
Tell me you need me
more than they do.

244
00:17:05,306 --> 00:17:07,480
I have to prepare for the raid.

245
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,538
Now, I want you to issue
this proclamation

246
00:18:34,658 --> 00:18:38,658
and I want you to make sure it is spoken
about in every corner of Nottingham,

247
00:18:39,311 --> 00:18:43,049
that due to his duties
and loyalties to the Sheriff,

248
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:46,399
the outlaw Allan A. Dale
is pardoned for all his wrongdoings.

249
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:48,999
- Allan A. Dale has...
- Just do it.

250
00:18:55,872 --> 00:18:56,879
Trust me.

251
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,428
Something funny, sis?

252
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:21,573
- How on earth did you get in here?
- Call the guards you'll never find out.

253
00:19:22,298 --> 00:19:23,993
- Speak.
- The tunnel!

254
00:19:24,382 --> 00:19:25,920
{\It was }An escape route for the old Sheriff.

255
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:28,760
But what's far more interesting...
is this.

256
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:32,960
It was supervised by
one Sir Guy of Gisborne.

257
00:19:34,057 --> 00:19:35,440
He and Hood are together now,

258
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:38,225
and with all that stuff
locked up in your courtyard,

259
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,000
just waiting to be stolen,

260
00:19:40,274 --> 00:19:42,960
how long do you think it'll take
before they come in the same way I did?

261
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,479
I'll get the guards and wait. I could
ambush them as soon as they emerge.

262
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,680
Guards are useless.
I've seen what they do to guards.

263
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,000
You need something a little more
sophisticated than guards.

264
00:19:52,632 --> 00:19:55,040
- Something they're not expecting.
- Keep talking.

265
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,329
Well...

266
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:02,000
for a few pennies,
I can trap the tunnel.

267
00:20:02,426 --> 00:20:04,495
It does happen to be
one of my specialities.

268
00:20:04,615 --> 00:20:06,473
If you can make sure
that they both die

269
00:20:06,593 --> 00:20:09,080
a slow and very painful death,

270
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,200
I'll give you more than pennies,

271
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:12,679
brother.

272
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:27,179
They've taken everything,
even the forging tools.

273
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:30,760
<i>This is a proclamation
from the Sheriff of Nottingham.</i>

274
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,520
<i>Let it be known that,
for services to the Sheriff,</i>

275
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,566
the outlaw Allan A. Dale

276
00:20:35,686 --> 00:20:38,760
has been given immunity
from prosecution.

277
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,479
He is a free man.

278
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:48,421
John! John!

279
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,320
All of this needs
to be made into arrowheads.

280
00:20:57,252 --> 00:20:59,640
- Robin?
- We're running out of time.

281
00:21:00,148 --> 00:21:01,160
Robin?

282
00:21:01,321 --> 00:21:03,047
Where's Tuck and John
with those tools?

283
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:04,676
She's gone! Kate.

284
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,880
You say something?

285
00:21:10,772 --> 00:21:12,840
- Why is it always my fault?
- I'm gonna find her.

286
00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:15,400
Much, Kate can look after herself.

287
00:21:15,561 --> 00:21:17,774
She's got a family to protect,
we've got a castle to take.

288
00:21:17,894 --> 00:21:18,894
I know.

289
00:21:20,219 --> 00:21:22,760
- What?
- Traitor! What did you tell them?

290
00:21:23,052 --> 00:21:25,402
- Judas!
- It's all over Nottingham.

291
00:21:26,026 --> 00:21:28,720
Allan's been pardoned by the Sheriff
for services rendered.

292
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,560
- What?! John, let him go.
- Let me speak!

293
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,755
Oh, yeah, you're good at that,
aren't you? Speaking and lying?!

294
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,280
- Twisting us round your little finger!
- John! Come on!

295
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:39,120
Let him go. Come on.

296
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:40,758
Liar!

297
00:21:42,806 --> 00:21:45,306
- All right?
- I haven't done anything!

298
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:49,067
I swear!
I haven't betrayed you.

299
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,268
Much!

300
00:21:57,205 --> 00:21:58,705
You believe me, Guy.

301
00:22:03,746 --> 00:22:04,559
Tuck?

302
00:22:10,392 --> 00:22:11,279
Robin?

303
00:22:14,598 --> 00:22:17,880
So, you think I'm a coward?
Is that it? Yeah?

304
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:21,800
What - that I've sold you out
to save myself somehow, yeah?

305
00:22:23,485 --> 00:22:25,960
- You've done that before.
- I know!

306
00:22:26,342 --> 00:22:28,200
And every day, I wish
I could take that back.

307
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:29,561
You know that!

308
00:22:34,923 --> 00:22:36,120
None of you?

309
00:22:38,686 --> 00:22:40,461
None of you believe me?

310
00:22:41,246 --> 00:22:42,646
I'll be off, then.

311
00:22:43,856 --> 00:22:46,939
No. Did you tell her
about the tunnel?

312
00:22:47,222 --> 00:22:49,251
- I told you, I haven't said...
- Tie him up!

313
00:22:49,371 --> 00:22:51,400
What? No, no, no, no.

314
00:22:51,712 --> 00:22:53,400
- I can't take the risk.
- Robin!

315
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,760
Once we've secured the castle, we will
come back and we will sort this out.

316
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,390
- John, don't do this.
- Get it done!

317
00:23:04,506 --> 00:23:06,359
<i>Don't even look at me!</i>

318
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:18,059
Stay here.

319
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,480
Specialist, you say?

320
00:23:28,124 --> 00:23:29,520
For your sake, you'd better be.

321
00:23:30,106 --> 00:23:32,556
You'll get your money's worth,
sister.

322
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:33,960
As long as I get mine.

323
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,800
You'll get paid on one condition.
That this trap kills Hood.

324
00:23:38,692 --> 00:23:40,039
You're the boss.

325
00:23:47,265 --> 00:23:50,920
We get into the castle, we capture
Isabella, release the villagers.

326
00:23:52,073 --> 00:23:54,168
But if the convoy leaves,
then we've failed.

327
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:57,320
And Tuck, John, it's up to you
to stop it, no matter what.

328
00:24:01,146 --> 00:24:03,996
This could be the last time
we see each other.

329
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,810
Best of luck.

330
00:24:16,066 --> 00:24:17,066
It's time.

331
00:24:32,212 --> 00:24:35,762
Put my neck on the block,
time and time again, and for what?

332
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:38,033
Nothing.

333
00:24:42,104 --> 00:24:45,880
Those of you who can fight, must
help us intercept the supply train.

334
00:24:48,545 --> 00:24:51,095
Those are your crops
inside that castle.

335
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,080
Your livestock,

336
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,640
your brothers. Damn it, men,
it's time to stand up and fight!

337
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,889
- Take back what's rightfully yours!
- Brother Tuck?

338
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:02,092
They're being trodden on, John,
and they're taking it.

339
00:25:02,212 --> 00:25:04,668
If they would only stand together,
they can defeat the Sheriff.

340
00:25:04,788 --> 00:25:07,400
Defeating the Sheriff
is our job, Tuck...

341
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:10,600
even if... it is the last thing

342
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:12,704
... we ever do.

343
00:25:19,707 --> 00:25:20,707
Robin?

344
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:22,804
This is it.

345
00:25:39,378 --> 00:25:40,920
You shouldn't mess with graves.

346
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:04,699
Hood and his men
have entered the tunnel.

347
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:06,773
Good.

348
00:26:09,153 --> 00:26:10,160
Thank you.

349
00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:17,240
This should buy your disappearance.

350
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:20,080
- Is this everything I asked for?
- Count it.

351
00:26:21,671 --> 00:26:23,120
- I believe you.
- Good.

352
00:26:23,446 --> 00:26:25,246
Then you can believe this.

353
00:26:25,555 --> 00:26:29,080
If I ever smell your fetid odour
anywhere near Nottingham again,

354
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:33,362
I will have you dipped in blood
and torn apart by starving dogs.

355
00:26:34,566 --> 00:26:36,166
My mother was a saint.

356
00:26:36,865 --> 00:26:40,080
The fact that she could have had
a child out of wedlock is bad enough.

357
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:43,279
But some nasty little
hustler like you...

358
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:47,956
Be assured,

359
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,398
I will kill a thousand times

360
00:26:51,518 --> 00:26:54,000
to keep my mother's
sacred memory pure.

361
00:26:56,317 --> 00:26:57,438
Don't worry.

362
00:26:57,558 --> 00:26:59,600
I've got plans far away from here.

363
00:27:02,241 --> 00:27:04,120
You'll never see me again.

364
00:27:09,396 --> 00:27:10,396
Kate!

365
00:27:13,472 --> 00:27:16,400
- What's happened?
- I found the locket.

366
00:27:17,383 --> 00:27:19,583
You were right. He loves Isabella.

367
00:27:19,703 --> 00:27:22,403
He must do,
otherwise why would he have it?

368
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:24,240
I'll gather everyone together.

369
00:27:29,586 --> 00:27:31,236
Come on, Kate. Come on.

370
00:27:34,733 --> 00:27:36,733
This is the right thing to do.

371
00:27:38,694 --> 00:27:40,887
- I know.
- Your brother was stupid enough

372
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:43,120
to get himself killed
for Robin's ridiculous cause.

373
00:27:43,281 --> 00:27:45,440
At least you have the good sense
to run away while you...

374
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:47,151
I'm not running away.

375
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,960
But if he is in league with her,

376
00:27:50,272 --> 00:27:52,440
then I don't understand
anything any more.

377
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:55,767
I thought I loved him.

378
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,078
Oh, Kate.

379
00:28:04,006 --> 00:28:06,040
I didn't know I could love
someone like that.

380
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:08,982
Kate, I'm so sorry.

381
00:28:09,863 --> 00:28:11,363
It's not your fault.

382
00:28:11,952 --> 00:28:13,640
No, no, you don't understand.

383
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,859
I was trying to protect you.

384
00:28:17,813 --> 00:28:20,720
- I had to do it.
- Had to do what?

385
00:28:22,273 --> 00:28:23,273
Tell me!

386
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,280
Robin doesn't love Isabella.

387
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:29,480
It was me. I put the locket
into his bag for you to find.

388
00:28:30,188 --> 00:28:32,188
You were supposed to leave him

389
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,760
and then we could get away
from here, to have a new life.

390
00:28:57,094 --> 00:29:00,120
- We're under the castle.
- Much, keep moving. Come on!

391
00:29:04,985 --> 00:29:05,999
Oh, no!

392
00:29:12,761 --> 00:29:13,761
No!

393
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:24,079
I knew it would be a trap!

394
00:29:24,425 --> 00:29:25,439
Much...

395
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:27,720
let me think.

396
00:29:28,841 --> 00:29:30,885
You give 'em
the best years of your life,

397
00:29:31,005 --> 00:29:32,205
and for what?!

398
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,810
No.

399
00:29:43,773 --> 00:29:44,873
It can't be.

400
00:30:07,028 --> 00:30:08,778
I've got to get to Robin.

401
00:30:17,513 --> 00:30:18,680
Nearly time.

402
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:21,717
It's quiet, isn't it?

403
00:30:22,973 --> 00:30:23,800
Calm.

404
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:26,324
It's like when you're hunting.

405
00:30:26,444 --> 00:30:29,694
The moment you spot your prey,
your stag, there's a...

406
00:30:30,593 --> 00:30:31,600
... stillness.

407
00:30:32,018 --> 00:30:35,440
Just for a moment, you wonder
whether you can go through with it,

408
00:30:35,786 --> 00:30:38,040
whether you can slaughter
this beast with... 

409
00:30:38,976 --> 00:30:39,976
so much...

410
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:42,839
Dignity?

411
00:30:44,818 --> 00:30:47,039
Yeah. Dignity.

412
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:54,533
John!

413
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:11,280
They're brave, but they can't fight.
Look at them. It'll be a massacre.

414
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,400
- They're not going to fight, John.
- What?

415
00:31:16,682 --> 00:31:20,136
Gentlemen, these gates
will open soon.

416
00:31:21,432 --> 00:31:25,303
Now, it is our task to stop
the supply train in its tracks.

417
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:29,000
And that is exactly
what we're going to do.

418
00:31:31,234 --> 00:31:35,200
As an army, as a militia,
we would be crushed.

419
00:31:36,553 --> 00:31:39,040
The Sheriff's men
would hack us down like weeds.

420
00:31:40,805 --> 00:31:43,480
But it's harder to cut
the spirit with a blade.

421
00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:48,824
When these gates open
and the supply train pulls out,

422
00:31:48,944 --> 00:31:51,000
we are going to sit down.

423
00:31:52,053 --> 00:31:54,320
Just sit... in silence.

424
00:31:55,252 --> 00:31:58,252
My friends, we are going to
turn the other cheek.

425
00:31:59,326 --> 00:32:03,026
- They will be... we will be crushed.
- Dignity, John. Dignity!

426
00:32:03,513 --> 00:32:06,600
Even when everything has been taken
from us, we still have that.

427
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,782
And the Sheriff's men
will be faced with a choice -

428
00:32:09,902 --> 00:32:12,280
stand aside or carry out a massacre.

429
00:32:12,621 --> 00:32:16,243
Yeah, these are the Sheriff's men.
{\I think }We know what choice they're gonna make.

430
00:32:16,363 --> 00:32:19,963
They may be soldiers, John,
but they are still men. Just men.

431
00:32:20,644 --> 00:32:22,960
And faced with the power of truth,
a man can change.

432
00:32:23,412 --> 00:32:25,800
If we all stand together,
we can have that power.

433
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:29,159
We can be unstoppable.

434
00:32:32,616 --> 00:32:33,720
So Allan's told her.

435
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,558
Or him.

436
00:32:35,678 --> 00:32:37,968
- I knew we shouldn't have trusted you.
- If I knew{\ this was a trap},

437
00:32:38,088 --> 00:32:39,600
do you think I'd be stuck in here{\ as well}?

438
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,880
That's enough, the both of you.

439
00:32:44,013 --> 00:32:45,320
What is that?

440
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,337
There's no way out.

441
00:32:55,193 --> 00:32:57,243
There's always a way out, Much.

442
00:32:58,721 --> 00:33:01,920
So, this is how it ends.
This is how we die.

443
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,189
Buried in limestone.

444
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:06,080
Hardly fair, is it?

445
00:33:06,241 --> 00:33:09,600
If one of us can reach the top,
we can hold out longer.

446
00:33:10,646 --> 00:33:12,635
Much, come here.
Gisborne, get on our shoulders.

447
00:33:12,755 --> 00:33:14,800
No! It's gotta be you, Robin.

448
00:33:15,487 --> 00:33:18,240
You're the one who has to live.
It has to be you.

449
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:21,050
All right, come on. Let's do this.

450
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:24,428
Ready? Ready, go!

451
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:44,367
<i>Allan?</i>

452
00:33:58,336 --> 00:33:59,336
You.

453
00:34:01,219 --> 00:34:02,769
Raise the portcullis!

454
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,275
Move out!

455
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:09,109
<i>Open the gates!</i>

456
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,320
You, there, move out of the road!

457
00:34:51,212 --> 00:34:53,599
Move out of the road, I said,

458
00:34:54,189 --> 00:34:56,760
or prepare to die where you sit.

459
00:35:03,992 --> 00:35:06,501
Men, draw your swords.

460
00:35:10,812 --> 00:35:13,482
I said draw your swords.

461
00:35:13,722 --> 00:35:15,022
Now!

462
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:22,160
Don't worry. I won't let you die!

463
00:35:23,073 --> 00:35:24,080
I'm sinking!

464
00:35:29,113 --> 00:35:30,520
I'm going under!

465
00:35:31,327 --> 00:35:33,504
- Give me your...
- Robin!

466
00:35:36,253 --> 00:35:37,253
Much!

467
00:35:38,215 --> 00:35:39,415
Stay together.

468
00:35:40,149 --> 00:35:42,800
{\Much, }If you stay together, you can breathe
for a little while longer.

469
00:35:43,272 --> 00:35:46,160
And keep your hands moving,
so I know.

470
00:35:48,825 --> 00:35:49,825
Much!

471
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,317
Much!

472
00:35:59,918 --> 00:36:00,920
Much!

473
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,715
<i>Get out of the way!</i>

474
00:36:43,554 --> 00:36:44,800
Cut them down!

475
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:51,119
Start with me, then!

476
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,120
Go on.

477
00:37:02,526 --> 00:37:04,400
Be a man! Start with me!

478
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,230
Do it or die.

479
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:08,280
And kill an innocent girl.

480
00:37:45,281 --> 00:37:46,481
Tuck, come on!

481
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:50,129
Let's go!

482
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:05,800
- We need to save Robin.
- What? Come on!

483
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:18,120
- We've got to get that rope, Kate.
- What's in there?

484
00:38:20,472 --> 00:38:22,074
- I've got it!
- Then pull!

485
00:38:22,194 --> 00:38:23,408
I'm pulling!

486
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:36,040
Oh, Robin!
No, no, no, no, no. Come on.

487
00:38:36,201 --> 00:38:38,281
Come on, come on, come on.

488
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,200
Come on, come on!
I need you! Breathe!

489
00:38:53,972 --> 00:38:56,880
- I thought I'd lost you.
- I thought I'd lost you.

490
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,600
My mother planted that locket.
I should never have doubted you.

491
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,255
Isabella was trying to rip us apart.

492
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,920
- Well, that means Allan's innocent.
- Allan?

493
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,680
She's been playing
with us all along.

494
00:39:15,193 --> 00:39:17,400
We need to find Isabella. Now!

495
00:39:17,852 --> 00:39:20,520
The entrance to the castle's
blocked. Follow me.

496
00:39:25,852 --> 00:39:28,496
The peasants are trying to
get into the castle.

497
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,960
- You have to protect me.
- Can't help.

498
00:39:32,713 --> 00:39:33,713
Sorry.

499
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,080
They're going to tear me to pieces.

500
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:37,360
Not my problem.

501
00:39:38,046 --> 00:39:41,596
- I've got to be somewhere else.
- I just gave you an order!

502
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,800
You have no idea
what's happening here, do you?

503
00:39:44,961 --> 00:39:45,961
What?

504
00:39:46,322 --> 00:39:49,872
You can't just leave me here
to be massacred by this rabble.

505
00:39:52,165 --> 00:39:55,240
Please! For pity's sake, help me.

506
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:58,209
If you want to save yourself,
hear this.

507
00:39:58,716 --> 00:40:00,440
Deliver Gisborne to the tunnel.

508
00:40:01,172 --> 00:40:04,040
That doesn't make any sense.
Gisborne is dead.

509
00:40:05,492 --> 00:40:08,055
Goodbye, Sheriff, and good luck.

510
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,120
Blamire!

511
00:40:15,866 --> 00:40:17,920
You forced my mother to lie to me.

512
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:19,840
You tried to poison me
against Robin.

513
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:22,840
So, what of it?
You don't belong together.

514
00:40:23,953 --> 00:40:25,689
An ill-raised peasant?

515
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:28,400
Hardly a worthy companion
for a man of noble birth.

516
00:40:43,979 --> 00:40:45,579
Don't come any closer.

517
00:40:52,026 --> 00:40:53,600
I believe this is yours.

518
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:57,175
It's over, Isabella.

519
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,200
In the name of King Richard,

520
00:41:04,691 --> 00:41:07,840
I charge Isabella of Gisborne
with high treason

521
00:41:08,406 --> 00:41:10,560
and crimes against
the people of Nottingham.

522
00:41:11,112 --> 00:41:13,240
The castle and everything in it

523
00:41:13,626 --> 00:41:15,440
belongs to the people!

524
00:41:25,561 --> 00:41:26,791
Robin!

525
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,758
Move. Move!

526
00:42:23,638 --> 00:42:24,938
Close the gates.

527
00:42:33,479 --> 00:42:35,174
Man the battlements!

528
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:40,583
Move!

529
00:42:48,326 --> 00:42:49,326
<i>Come on!</i>

530
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,260
My lord.

531
00:42:53,957 --> 00:42:57,160
Blamire, you old tomcat.
How the devil are you?

532
00:42:57,626 --> 00:42:59,400
The plan is in place.

533
00:43:00,153 --> 00:43:01,153
Good.

534
00:43:04,819 --> 00:43:06,769
Oh, this will be so much fun.

535
00:43:08,601 --> 00:43:09,601
Come on!

536
00:43:10,763 --> 00:43:11,763
Robin!

537
00:43:13,164 --> 00:43:14,164
Robin!

538
00:43:23,161 --> 00:43:25,199
We will have our reckoning.

539
00:43:25,361 --> 00:43:27,840
Right now, I want my town back!

540
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:31,720
I want every able-bodied man
armed and ready.

541
00:43:32,273 --> 00:43:34,040
All Nottingham, for the King!

542
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,680
You so want to kill me, don't you?

543
00:43:39,225 --> 00:43:40,840
We attack immediately!

544
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,600
<i>Abandon the battlements!</i>

545
00:43:44,879 --> 00:43:46,640
Destroy everything!

546
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:51,160
<i>Together, for England!</i>
