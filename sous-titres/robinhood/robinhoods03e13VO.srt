1
00:00:01,596 --> 00:00:03,496
Bring forward the trebuchet.

2
00:00:04,179 --> 00:00:06,524
Load and make ready.

3
00:00:08,315 --> 00:00:10,065
Unfurl the flag of truce.

4
00:00:12,356 --> 00:00:15,360
This is my destiny, Blamire.
The time is almost upon us.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,225
Welcome to hell, Robin Hood.

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,399
What have we done?

7
00:00:23,826 --> 00:00:25,376
We doubted him, John.

8
00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:30,680
- He did this. He killed him!
- Much. Much!

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,400
- You'll have time for that.
- There's soldiers at every wall.

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,876
Hundreds of them.
The whole town's surrounded.

11
00:00:35,996 --> 00:00:37,920
I put a dagger in him.
I saw him die.

12
00:00:38,468 --> 00:00:40,768
Well, that ghost has raised an army.

13
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,240
Surprise. You thought I was dead.

14
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:02,280
But you didn't check, did you?

15
00:01:03,135 --> 00:01:04,485
Very nasty wound.

16
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,799
Gisborne, we will
have our reckoning.

17
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:11,822
Right now I want my town back.

18
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,280
Never. You're finished, Vasey.

19
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:18,861
Your weapons are no match for the hatred
these men have for you.

20
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:22,320
You tell your peasant army
anybody who resists me will die.

21
00:01:23,112 --> 00:01:24,162
Poor Allan.

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,873
He squealed like a stuck pig
when he died.

23
00:01:26,993 --> 00:01:29,293
- Robin.
- And you'll pay for that.

24
00:01:29,413 --> 00:01:32,040
- You murdering swine.
- Sticks and stones, Hood.

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,240
Give them a demonstration, Blamire.

26
00:01:40,995 --> 00:01:42,030
Loose.

27
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,680
You have until dawn.
Give me Gisborne,

28
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:57,800
release Isabella and then return
Nottingham to myself and Prince John.

29
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,078
Otherwise,
you and your noisy friends,

30
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:02,800
they'll be wiped off the face
of the earth.

31
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:11,281
The Sub Wood Team

32
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,190
Episode 13
SOMETHING WORTH FIGHTING FOR (part 2)

33
00:02:48,825 --> 00:02:50,329
What the hell was that?

34
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:52,706
The Arabs call it Byzantine fire.

35
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,000
Doesn't work like you'd expect.

36
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:57,680
See?

37
00:02:58,527 --> 00:03:01,720
Sticky. Like oil. Repels water.

38
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
May I?

39
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:07,520
<i>Phlegon thanatos.</i>
Literally "the burning death".

40
00:03:08,372 --> 00:03:11,293
An alchemical mixture
of flammable elements.

41
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,092
I've heard of it, but I've never
seen it used till now.

42
00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:17,442
This'll spread chaos across the town,
destroying everything{\ and everyone} in its way.

43
00:03:17,562 --> 00:03:20,384
Put lookouts on every wall!
Scour the town.

44
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:23,874
Tuck, I want every able-bodied man
armed and ready.

45
00:03:24,451 --> 00:03:26,720
We hold Nottingham, for the king!

46
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,920
We know the king's coming. He has loyal
troops waiting for him at Loughborough.

47
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:32,839
If we can get word to them...

48
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,223
Robin, you could end this
by giving me up to the Sheriff.

49
00:03:35,343 --> 00:03:37,358
You could have done it back there.
Why didn't you?

50
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:39,269
This is bigger than you, Gisborne.

51
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:41,771
It always has been. We're fighting
for the future of England.

52
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:44,004
You have Isabella behind bars.
That's what you wanted.

53
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,820
This isn't your fight
unless you choose it to be.

54
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,320
While the Sheriff lives, this is
all our fight. I'm with you.

55
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:52,283
Get it done!

56
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,760
There's something
we have to do first.

57
00:03:57,943 --> 00:03:59,536
Honour the dead.

58
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,473
To Allan.

59
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:29,687
Our loyal friend.

60
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:04,400
Did you know
the Sheriff was still alive?

61
00:05:08,204 --> 00:05:09,920
I knew nothing of this.

62
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:14,578
Leave us.

63
00:05:17,127 --> 00:05:19,240
You so want to kill me, don't you?

64
00:05:20,207 --> 00:05:21,520
What's stopping you, Guy?

65
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:24,014
Not the fact
that I'm a woman, surely.

66
00:05:24,134 --> 00:05:26,579
You're so good at killing
defenceless females.

67
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,880
You're alright. There is too much
blood on my hands already.

68
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:34,276
Isabella, you'll find no mercy
amongst the outlaws now.

69
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,760
So when the time is right,

70
00:05:40,694 --> 00:05:42,560
... you might want to use this.

71
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,171
Poison.

72
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,676
A single drop will act
slowly and painfully.

73
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:48,599
For it to be quick,
you must take it all.

74
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:50,920
This is your idea of mercy?

75
00:05:52,337 --> 00:05:54,400
Your last brotherly gesture.

76
00:05:55,848 --> 00:05:58,783
For whose sake, Guy? Mine or yours?

77
00:06:01,357 --> 00:06:03,457
I do this for our mother's sake.

78
00:06:05,586 --> 00:06:09,586
Although there is precious little
of her goodness left in either of us.

79
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:22,720
Guy.

80
00:06:26,657 --> 00:06:28,122
What are you doing?

81
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:30,685
We have to get word to the King's
troops at Loughborough.

82
00:06:30,805 --> 00:06:32,880
- No, Kate. Robin...
- Wants to protect me.

83
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,167
But someone has to get help.

84
00:06:35,287 --> 00:06:37,061
You saw what happened to Allan.

85
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:40,080
It's so we don't all end up
like Allan, that I'm doing this.

86
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,600
Pull the rope up after me.

87
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:51,046
And tell Robin...

88
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,840
I'll be back with an army.

89
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:19,388
- What's happened?
- It's Kate.

90
00:07:19,508 --> 00:07:22,542
Kate's taken it upon herself
to go to Loughborough for the troops.

91
00:07:22,662 --> 00:07:25,309
She knows what she's doing.
You taught her well.

92
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:28,832
The Sheriff is playing with us!
He knows he's got the advantage.

93
00:07:28,952 --> 00:07:31,760
We have to hold this castle
until the troops arrive.

94
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
Can we?

95
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,868
I mean, how long under bombardment
from Byzantine fire?

96
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,960
- He's got plenty of it.
- How do you know?

97
00:07:38,735 --> 00:07:41,465
- I sold it to him.
- For a profit?

98
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:45,440
You sold it to the man
who killed my friend?!

99
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:47,560
Now your trade
has caught up with you!

100
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:50,560
And you're going to be
bombarded by your own weapons.

101
00:07:50,855 --> 00:07:53,863
I've done you a favour
by sticking round here.

102
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:57,235
- I saved your ungrateful lives!
- Our lives wouldn't have needed saving

103
00:07:57,355 --> 00:07:59,370
if you hadn't trapped the tunnel
in the first place.

104
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,480
We lock him up. We can't trust him.

105
00:08:02,187 --> 00:08:04,987
Well, what's the matter?
A guilty conscience?

106
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:07,880
And what about all those people that're
going to die because of your greed?

107
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,400
What about all those who have died
because they listened to Robin Hood?

108
00:08:13,324 --> 00:08:17,320
A few untrained,
under-equipped peasants

109
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:19,240
against that war machine.

110
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,540
So you think about
what you got them into...

111
00:08:27,615 --> 00:08:29,440
before you ever try and judge me.

112
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,400
We have to take the trebuchets.

113
00:08:39,037 --> 00:08:40,937
A small unit, tonight.

114
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:44,107
Are you with me?

115
00:08:45,869 --> 00:08:48,169
I'll see you all at the battlements.

116
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:56,112
There's pockets of men
around the walls.

117
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:57,520
Regular patrols.

118
00:08:58,109 --> 00:09:00,109
You all know what we're doing.

119
00:09:00,418 --> 00:09:03,520
We go up along the dry mount, then
we head for that cart and then the tent.

120
00:09:04,223 --> 00:09:07,440
That'll give us cover until we make
our way to the trebuchets.

121
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,840
Much, you're in charge.

122
00:09:11,236 --> 00:09:14,157
If we don't come back,
you fight to the end.

123
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:16,633
- I'm coming too, aren't I?
- No, you're not.

124
00:09:16,753 --> 00:09:18,690
I need a cool head here,
not a hot one out there.

125
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,587
- What?
- Listen{\ to me}. You'll get your revenge

126
00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:22,257
for Allan. I promise.

127
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:29,931
Right, let's do this.

128
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:31,268
Ready?

129
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:02,344
All right.

130
00:10:25,987 --> 00:10:27,487
- Yeah?
- Let's go.

131
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,664
<i>Come on, you lazy rebels!</i>

132
00:10:37,293 --> 00:10:38,840
<i>Move yourselves!</i>

133
00:10:39,716 --> 00:10:41,642
<i>Get to your posts!</i>

134
00:10:43,335 --> 00:10:45,280
<i>Weapons ready.</i>

135
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,688
The Sheriff had no intention
of waiting till dawn.

136
00:10:48,808 --> 00:10:50,400
<i>We attack immediately!</i>

137
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:54,160
Time to wake them up, I think.

138
00:10:57,117 --> 00:10:58,244
Loose!

139
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:04,191
What's going on, Blamire?

140
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:07,546
Run for cover!

141
00:11:12,074 --> 00:11:13,581
<i>Come on! Run!</i>

142
00:11:16,136 --> 00:11:17,386
The trebuchets!

143
00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:22,738
Robin Hood! Get him!

144
00:11:23,836 --> 00:11:24,916
<i>Stay there!</i>

145
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:26,036
Robin.

146
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,840
Run for it, Robin!Go!

147
00:11:45,161 --> 00:11:47,911
Archers, to the left flank!
Prepare to fire.

148
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,880
Open the gate!

149
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,520
You see?

150
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,900
- Now you know.
- That's for Allan!

151
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:16,527
- I thought you'd run out on us.
- Thought you needed a hand.

152
00:12:16,647 --> 00:12:17,797
By the way...

153
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,280
I got you a present,
courtesy of the Sheriff.

154
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,890
What's that?

155
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:25,793
It's Byzantine fire!

156
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:29,031
If I can work out its base components,
I can make some more of this.

157
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:31,051
So we CAN fight the Sheriff?

158
00:12:31,895 --> 00:12:32,920
Do it.

159
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,680
Destroy everything!

160
00:12:38,034 --> 00:12:39,640
Storm those gates!

161
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,840
I want Robin Hood's head.

162
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,800
Attack!

163
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:47,262
Well, well, well.

164
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:51,439
You are a big boy, aren't you?

165
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,523
Oh, come on now. Don't be shy.

166
00:12:55,836 --> 00:12:58,600
It's just you and me,
waiting for the end.

167
00:12:58,885 --> 00:13:02,285
I mean, Robin Hood can't win.
You saw the Sheriff's army.

168
00:13:03,562 --> 00:13:06,062
So I guess we're
in the same position -

169
00:13:07,478 --> 00:13:08,560
condemned.

170
00:13:10,476 --> 00:13:11,837
Such a waste.

171
00:13:14,331 --> 00:13:16,800
Robin! We're going to need
the King's troops fast.

172
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:18,560
Kate won't let us down.

173
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:28,866
The gates won't hold
against a battering ram

174
00:13:28,986 --> 00:13:31,636
and we don't have
the men to take them on.

175
00:13:33,982 --> 00:13:35,855
Run!Take cover!

176
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,160
Pull everyone back
into the castle courtyard.

177
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,320
We'll defend from there
until the King's troops arrive.

178
00:13:57,718 --> 00:13:59,630
- Take cover.
- Abandon this tower.

179
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,040
Take a company of archers.
Hold them as long as possible.

180
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,500
One, two, three.

181
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,293
Abandon the tower!

182
00:14:14,112 --> 00:14:15,112
Steady!

183
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,160
Draw!

184
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:25,277
Loose!

185
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:30,320
Run!

186
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,520
Hold! Hold!

187
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:39,250
Hold! Nock, draw!

188
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,568
Loose!

189
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:45,000
Nock, draw, loose!

190
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:48,838
- Fall back.
- Ready!

191
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,120
Nock, draw, loose!

192
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:54,200
Fall back!

193
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:57,080
Back to the castle!

194
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:11,880
Isn't it traditional to offer
the condemned one last request?

195
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:13,800
You open the door

196
00:15:13,961 --> 00:15:16,996
and I'll give you exactly
what you want.

197
00:15:36,957 --> 00:15:38,568
Men are so easy.

198
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,620
John!

199
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:46,880
Bring the battering ram.
Smash those gates.

200
00:15:47,265 --> 00:15:49,374
And bring me the prisoner
you captured.

201
00:15:49,494 --> 00:15:50,716
My lord.

202
00:15:50,836 --> 00:15:52,733
<i>Battering ram. Now!</i>

203
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,680
Portcullis!

204
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,536
- Get in rank with me.
- Get ready. Hold!

205
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,160
Draw!

206
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,320
- Loo...
- Wait!

207
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,830
I'm sorry, Robin.

208
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,160
Not as sorry as she's going to be.

209
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,168
She was on her way from Loughborough,
with this.

210
00:16:21,242 --> 00:16:24,203
Expecting reinforcements?
Not coming.

211
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,160
Don't believe me?

212
00:16:28,794 --> 00:16:29,794
Tell him.

213
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:31,916
Much.

214
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,600
King Richard isn't coming either.
He was on his way...

215
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,240
- Can you do it?
- Watch me.

216
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,520
... but he was captured
by Leopold of Austria.

217
00:16:42,196 --> 00:16:44,800
- You're lying.
- It's true. He's being held to ransom.

218
00:16:45,663 --> 00:16:48,280
250,000 crowns.

219
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,480
Enough money to bankrupt a nation.

220
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,556
The troops at Loughborough won't fight
unless Richard leads them.

221
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:55,426
So what's it to be, Hood?

222
00:16:55,659 --> 00:16:57,520
Surrender or slaughter?

223
00:16:57,821 --> 00:16:58,821
Neither.

224
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:01,819
You see,

225
00:17:03,584 --> 00:17:05,800
I don't trust you, Vasey.

226
00:17:06,377 --> 00:17:09,227
- You said you'd take no prisoners.
- Oh, yes.

227
00:17:09,732 --> 00:17:12,360
Yes, I did say that.
Well, that was rather hasty of me.

228
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:17,080
I mean, who's going to pay tax
if the villagers are all dead?

229
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:20,202
So, what?

230
00:17:20,688 --> 00:17:23,110
You're going to release
all these people now,

231
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,720
- only to make slaves of them later?
- Why?

232
00:17:27,703 --> 00:17:30,403
You don't give me
much of a choice, do you?

233
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:33,800
What, have you got some little trick
tucked up your sleeve, have you?

234
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:36,807
Humiliate me and rescue the girl?

235
00:17:37,187 --> 00:17:38,920
You're so predictable, Hood.

236
00:17:39,794 --> 00:17:41,344
Bored with that game.

237
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:43,661
Kill her. Kate!

238
00:17:43,781 --> 00:17:45,581
Above you! Lower the rope!

239
00:17:52,202 --> 00:17:53,202
Pull.

240
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:55,280
Fire!

241
00:17:57,763 --> 00:17:58,763
Quick.

242
00:18:06,104 --> 00:18:08,520
That is the last time Robin Hood
makes a fool out of me!

243
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:14,040
To the tunnel.

244
00:18:19,243 --> 00:18:21,280
It's working. They're falling back.

245
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,144
They're regrouping.
Barricade the portcullis!

246
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,240
Come here.

247
00:18:34,453 --> 00:18:36,403
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

248
00:18:37,086 --> 00:18:38,436
<i>Bring him inside.</i>

249
00:18:45,514 --> 00:18:46,814
<i>Still breathing.</i>

250
00:19:05,516 --> 00:19:07,366
The people need you, Robin.

251
00:19:08,584 --> 00:19:09,734
Talk to them.

252
00:19:12,396 --> 00:19:13,396
Robin.

253
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,233
Loyal comrades,
you know the situation.

254
00:19:48,097 --> 00:19:50,640
And you know that we are on our own.

255
00:19:51,171 --> 00:19:54,400
Now, we have already lost friends
and loved ones.

256
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:58,271
But England... will lose far more

257
00:19:58,391 --> 00:20:00,480
if we do not make a stand this day.

258
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:04,019
And yes, some of us may fall,

259
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:07,790
but our fight will live on,

260
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:12,761
in the minds of those
that despise injustice.

261
00:20:13,953 --> 00:20:16,200
In the hearts of those
that cherish freedom.

262
00:20:17,477 --> 00:20:19,482
You are the soul of England,

263
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:22,400
standing firm against tyranny
for a real future.

264
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:27,160
Now ask yourself - is that not something
worth fighting for?

265
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:29,479
Together,

266
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,570
for England!

267
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
Yeah!

268
00:20:42,422 --> 00:20:43,440
Archers!

269
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:10,352
No, no, no!

270
00:21:11,347 --> 00:21:13,744
Much, get down to the portcullis.
Help hold it.

271
00:21:13,864 --> 00:21:14,864
Right.

272
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,800
Robin Hood won't know
what's hit him.

273
00:21:24,438 --> 00:21:25,438
Blocked.

274
00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:28,586
There's a balance trap.

275
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:31,733
We'll never get
through there, my lord.

276
00:21:34,898 --> 00:21:36,748
Well, we'll see about that.

277
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:38,741
Back.

278
00:21:39,747 --> 00:21:42,522
Back! Bring down the Byzantine fire.

279
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:51,320
Archers, forward!

280
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,374
Tuck!Yeah?

281
00:21:58,494 --> 00:22:01,158
I need that fire.
We can't hold out much longer.

282
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,612
Robin, Robin.

283
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,160
Nut oil. The Sheriff
had gallons of it in the cellar.

284
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,301
Boiling oil. We can use it.

285
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,085
No, no, no, no, no.
I can do better than that.

286
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,279
Watch.

287
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,961
The nut oil is a base compound.

288
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,672
Come on.

289
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,280
That, my friend, is Byzantine fire.

290
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,309
How much have we got?

291
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,102
Gallons and gallons.

292
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,070
- Get it done.
- Robin!

293
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,090
The portcullis is breached.
We can't hold them.

294
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,868
They're going to take the courtyard!

295
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:50,359
Much, pull back!

296
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,746
John, abandon the battlements.

297
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,956
Much, Much!

298
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,334
Get everyone in the hall!

299
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,279
Abandon the battlements!

300
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,800
Fall back!

301
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,680
Pass out the weapons and ammunition!

302
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,720
Gisborne,
get these men into position.

303
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,440
Barricade the doors. Move!

304
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,768
Guy.

305
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,313
Isabella.

306
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,859
It's the entrance
to the escape tunnel.

307
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,371
Why has she gone in there?
She knows it's blocked.

308
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,550
- I'm going to get Robin.
- No.

309
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,831
She's mine.

310
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,160
Barricade the door!

311
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,520
- Where does that lead?
- To the cellar and back to the castle.

312
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:06,403
So, you've laid out
the barrels like I told you to.

313
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,520
- Exactly as you said.
- Good.

314
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,699
Very good.

315
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,040
Byzantine fire.

316
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,000
So that's why Isabella
came down here.

317
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,216
She's trying to blast
her way out of the tunnel.

318
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,427
Might be a way out for all of us.

319
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,960
Go and tell Robin.
I'll deal with Isabella.

320
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,473
Fill it. Fill it, please. Robin!

321
00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:39,129
Robin,

322
00:24:39,607 --> 00:24:42,311
if we use this much Byzantine fire
we'll destroy everything.

323
00:24:42,431 --> 00:24:44,722
- The castle, the Sheriff's army...
- And his power.

324
00:24:44,842 --> 00:24:47,120
Everything he has, gone for ever.
That's what we want.

325
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,137
We'll kill every man,
woman and child.

326
00:24:49,257 --> 00:24:52,371
Robin! The tunnel.
Isabella's just cleared it.

327
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,960
Robin! They're coming.

328
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,835
Hold them out.
Tuck, you're in charge.

329
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,540
John, hold the doors.

330
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,039
- Isabella.
- Guy?

331
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,215
Isabella, where are you?

332
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,859
Come and get me.

333
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:34,196
- That explosion.
- The tunnel should be clear by now.

334
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,280
I'd say there's a way out
if you want it.

335
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,289
Look at you, Guy.

336
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,723
Perhaps it's time you took
the poison for yourself.

337
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,960
After all, you've destroyed anyone
you've ever held dear to you.

338
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,360
You know, brother,
you loved me once.

339
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,093
And me too.

340
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,405
You planned this.

341
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:03,353
Isabella, you will, of course,
relinquish your claims to my title -

342
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,273
if you wish to join me.

343
00:26:10,024 --> 00:26:12,826
I didn't want anyone else to
have the pleasure of killing you, so...

344
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,920
I set up this little trap.

345
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,783
Stay back.

346
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,660
He's mine.

347
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,920
The man who tried to kill me.

348
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,541
I made you!

349
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,360
I won't make the same mistake twice.

350
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,189
Still as treacherous as ever.

351
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,694
Gisborne!

352
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,199
How appropriate... a battle so huge

353
00:27:17,587 --> 00:27:19,360
should come down
to the important few.

354
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,320
A new one.

355
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,440
- Don't know you, do I?
- He's my mother's mistake.

356
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:29,320
Look at us. The whole sorry family.

357
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,120
- Together.
- Brothers in arms.

358
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,279
Archer!

359
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:53,952
This is for all the lives you've ruined,
all the people you've killed!

360
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,239
Now, Hood...

361
00:27:55,401 --> 00:27:56,401
Robin!

362
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,017
Gisborne!

363
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,691
This ends... here!

364
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,734
How right you are, Robin Hood.

365
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,805
It's a scratch. It's nothing.

366
00:28:19,925 --> 00:28:21,280
No, you should be careful.

367
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,983
I mean, this blade,
it could be rusty or... or even worse.

368
00:28:25,313 --> 00:28:27,720
- What have you done?
- I used your poison on the blade.

369
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,560
A few drops flowing
through your bloodstream.

370
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,840
I'd say you'll be dead by sundown.

371
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,588
Is this true?

372
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,800
This is too good to be true.

373
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,763
You've killed Robin Hood!

374
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,840
We'll be back to finish
the rest of you off with an army.

375
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:53,022
Please, wait for me.

376
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,800
I don't want to miss the big moment.

377
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,991
Get the people out
through the cellar.

378
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,308
Backs onto this tunnel.

379
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,669
The Sheriff will take his men
the easy route, through the great hall.

380
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,571
Do we hide our people in that tunnel
until he moves his men through?

381
00:29:12,691 --> 00:29:14,491
And then we lead ours out?

382
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,720
Get word to Tuck. Go on.

383
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,640
Brother.

384
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,760
Is this the end?

385
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,724
For you and me both, my friend.

386
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:35,320
I'm sorry.

387
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,383
At least you have
someone waiting for you.

388
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,280
Marian.

389
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,156
The love of my life.

390
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,543
She was always yours.

391
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,080
I've lived in shame.

392
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,710
But because of you,

393
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,920
I die proud.

394
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,760
I am free.

395
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:30,667
Tuck, get up here!
We can't hold them.

396
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,960
Just a little bit longer.

397
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,290
Come on!

398
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:38,000
Leave the door. Everyone is
to follow me. Robin's orders.

399
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,216
With me. To the cellars!

400
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,412
- Are we ready?
- Yeah. We're done, we're done.

401
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:51,933
Gisborne?

402
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,280
- Get these people out!
- Come on!

403
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,372
This is no time for sentiment.

404
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,480
- Try again, come on.
<i>- I'm going.</i>

405
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:38,938
Move.

406
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,936
Come on, John.

407
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,406
Come on, John.

408
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,756
Stay back!

409
00:32:17,401 --> 00:32:19,234
Come on. Get them out!

410
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,069
- Go on.
- Come on.

411
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,403
You're hurt.

412
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,864
- Robin.
- Just go on to the other side.

413
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,784
I'll see you there. Go on.

414
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,198
Archer, she mustn't know, all right?

415
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,452
Know what? What's happened?

416
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,330
There's something you need to know.

417
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,959
John. Get them all to the forest.

418
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,258
- Tuck, you set everything up?
- Yes.

419
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:53,262
Archer, you come with me. Come on.

420
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,822
They've all escaped.
How could that happen?

421
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:31,175
- Can you do this?
- Of course I can.

422
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,554
I am Robin Hood.

423
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,772
Come on! Let's go.

424
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,694
Byzantine fire.

425
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,239
We did it! We did it!

426
00:34:11,401 --> 00:34:12,407
Yes!

427
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,474
You did it! You did it!

428
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,602
You did it.

429
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,688
You did it!

430
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,960
Where is he? Where's Robin?
He should be here to celebrate.

431
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,320
Listen to me.
There was a fight in the tunnel.

432
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,800
Isabella cut Robin with a dagger.
The blade was poisoned.

433
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:49,504
- What?
- He's dying, Much. And quickly.

434
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,255
It's time to say goodbye.

435
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:58,937
- Kate...
- No!

436
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,880
I'd forgotten how beautiful
sunsets here can be.

437
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,558
Sherwood.

438
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,186
This is home.

439
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,040
Is it true?

440
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,455
The final battle.

441
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,332
No.

442
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,019
No, this can't happen.

443
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,597
There's... there's a cure.

444
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,676
Much...

445
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,560
We have cheated death so many times.

446
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,355
What am I going to be without you?

447
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:37,005
You are already more of a man than
I will ever be.

448
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,409
Much.

449
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,205
And you're my best friend.

450
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,467
- This isn't fair.
- Oh, come on, John.

451
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,520
Today is a good day to die!

452
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,199
And you,

453
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,916
you make sure
this doesn't finish here.

454
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,997
Because this...
this is where you belong.

455
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:34,335
- Without you?
- These men are your brothers now.

456
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,763
Our work isn't finished yet, Tuck.

457
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,999
You found me again and you saved me.

458
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:50,226
And you'll find another leader.
I know you will.

459
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,608
Kate.

460
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,114
Brave Kate.

461
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,760
I'm sorry I have to leave you.

462
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,042
All of you.

463
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,821
But I have to do this alone.

464
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:34,830
Marian.

465
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,000
I have waited for you.

466
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,256
I knew I would find you again.

467
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,635
It's time.

468
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,920
The greatest adventure
is yet to come.

469
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,479
- My wife.
- Now and for ever, my love.

470
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:16,432
I never thought
it would end like this.

471
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,059
It does not end, Much.

472
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,320
Robin Hood goes on.
Our work here is far from finished.

473
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,809
Our leader and our friend is dead.

474
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,480
We can't go on.

475
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,950
Would you let his legacy
die along with him?

476
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,128
He wouldn't want us to give up.

477
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,385
As long as Prince John
and his allies bring misery

478
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:51,039
to the people of England,
we will fight it.

479
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,799
We are Robin Hood.

480
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,949
I'm with you.

481
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,454
Much.

482
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,915
For Robin.

483
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:41,373
- Robin Hood.
- Robin Hood.

484
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:42,893
Robin Hood.

485
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:47,856
Let's go.

486
00:42:58,155 --> 00:43:01,705
Thanks for this season.
