1
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,090
You realising how difficult
life can be in the forest?

2
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:23,808
How long have you and your men
been following me?

3
00:00:23,928 --> 00:00:25,385
You're jumpy.

4
00:00:25,796 --> 00:00:26,840
Answer me!

5
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:30,119
Gisborne, I have better things
to do with my day.

6
00:00:31,377 --> 00:00:32,440
I'm alone.

7
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:43,359
Very well.

8
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:45,759
Really?

9
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:51,891
You're really sure
you want to do this now?

10
00:00:53,213 --> 00:00:55,120
- Why not?
- What, honestly?

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,067
I don't think you have the energy.

12
00:01:00,187 --> 00:01:02,189
I don't need food or sleep
to drive me.

13
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,760
- Then what do you need?
- Revenge.

14
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,600
- On who, Prince John?
- Prince John will keep.

15
00:01:07,761 --> 00:01:10,999
Isabella will not. Neither will you.

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
Gisborne?

17
00:01:33,237 --> 00:01:37,170
The Sub Wood Team

18
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,800
Episode ten
BAD BLOOD

19
00:02:31,483 --> 00:02:34,297
- What is this?
- Who's done this?

20
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:35,720
- Hood?
- No.

21
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:42,160
Where are you?
You're a coward to take us like this.

22
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,599
Show yourself!

23
00:02:46,946 --> 00:02:47,959
Gisborne.

24
00:03:04,272 --> 00:03:06,273
Who sent you? Prince John?

25
00:03:06,393 --> 00:03:09,040
No, this is one
of your sister's tricks.

26
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:14,459
- What would Isabella want with us?
- I want you to listen and understand.

27
00:03:15,055 --> 00:03:16,720
Someone's life depends on it.

28
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:19,960
I find it hard to understand
when I'm tied.

29
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:22,261
- Now free me!
- I'll free you.

30
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,349
Free you from the bad blood
that shackles you to each other.

31
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:30,116
Well, maybe there are good reasons
for that bad blood.

32
00:03:31,523 --> 00:03:33,360
What do you know
about our lives, anyway?

33
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,280
More than you do.

34
00:03:37,075 --> 00:03:38,425
I know the truth.

35
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,240
The truth about what?

36
00:03:40,838 --> 00:03:43,088
About how your parents really died.

37
00:03:43,761 --> 00:03:45,160
<i>My father's inside!</i>

38
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:48,579
<i>Yours, too! And your mother!
Do something!</i>

39
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,166
You know about the fire.

40
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
So?

41
00:03:57,826 --> 00:03:59,572
It was never a secret.

42
00:04:01,485 --> 00:04:04,635
Everybody knew that we both
became orphans that day.

43
00:04:04,755 --> 00:04:08,005
There are still things you don't know
about your past.

44
00:04:11,827 --> 00:04:15,117
Oh, Ghislaine, I've been thinking
about you all day.

45
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:18,987
We do not have much time,
but if you wish to talk, then...

46
00:04:22,724 --> 00:04:25,763
I look forward to the day
when we no longer have to hide

47
00:04:25,883 --> 00:04:28,920
- in stables and outhouses to do this.
- Not long now, my love.

48
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,490
My father loved one woman only,
and that was my mother.

49
00:04:39,681 --> 00:04:41,240
That's just what you were told.

50
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,320
The truth was kept from you
by your precious father.

51
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:46,790
- What're you talking about?
- He shielded you from reality

52
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,501
like he always did.

53
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:55,074
You were never made to face
the consequences of your actions.

54
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:58,520
You were once
on a very different path, Robin.

55
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:09,320
- Robin, come and give Swain a hand!
- Yes, Father.

56
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,760
Guy, Isabella, come with me.

57
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:14,560
Ladies and gentlemen!

58
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,600
I am so pleased you decided
to join me

59
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:21,639
in celebrating the safe return
of our men from the Holy Land.

60
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:26,520
Sadly, not everyone was able
to make the journey back

61
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,801
and I would ask that we think
also of our loved ones

62
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:31,515
who died on this day.

63
00:05:32,714 --> 00:05:36,714
As you know,
I feel your pain as it is my own,

64
00:05:37,745 --> 00:05:40,045
my own husband being among the dead.

65
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:43,840
My Lady Gisborne.

66
00:05:45,923 --> 00:05:48,968
As bailiff of these parts,
it's my duty to ask...

67
00:05:49,327 --> 00:05:52,027
- who will now be lord of the manor.
- Longthorn!

68
00:05:52,147 --> 00:05:55,209
- Now is not the time.
- No. He's right to ask.

69
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,956
There will be no lord.

70
00:05:58,076 --> 00:06:00,840
Instead, there will be
a lady of the manor.

71
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
So...

72
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:05,646
we're expected to serve a woman.

73
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:08,007
A French woman!

74
00:06:09,698 --> 00:06:11,440
The land should be {\returned}to Lord Locksley.

75
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:13,760
- Longthorn!
- This village was awarded

76
00:06:13,921 --> 00:06:15,968
to your husband, for his services
in the Holy Land.

77
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:18,720
Now he is dead,
it's your right to reclaim them.

78
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:21,031
A right I will not be exercising.

79
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,720
Sir Roger fought and died
for an English King.

80
00:06:24,002 --> 00:06:25,680
His family should be respected.

81
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:29,199
To Sir Roger of Gisborne.

82
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,920
Sir Roger of Gisborne!

83
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:35,170
Now,

84
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:38,280
to celebrate those who have returned

85
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:41,347
and to honour those who have not,

86
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:44,438
I want you to join me
in enjoying something

87
00:06:44,558 --> 00:06:46,840
the men have brought back
from their travels.

88
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:50,868
The Fire Wheel will light our skies

89
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:55,338
to show us that our darkest days
are now behind us.

90
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:59,009
Now, I need two strong men
to lift the wheel,

91
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:02,080
and the two best archers
in the county.

92
00:07:02,613 --> 00:07:04,520
Robin, will you help me?

93
00:07:06,044 --> 00:07:07,319
And Guy?

94
00:07:08,092 --> 00:07:09,314
Father, may I?

95
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:11,335
- Robin...
- I want to make the shot.

96
00:07:11,455 --> 00:07:14,055
And you will,
but not because of the bow.

97
00:07:14,273 --> 00:07:15,520
You're not ready.

98
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,960
I don't know why
you're bothering, Guy.

99
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,800
You're a terrible shot.

100
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,880
I'm younger than you and everyone knows
I'm the best shot in the village.

101
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,685
Only because you keep
telling everyone you are.

102
00:07:33,805 --> 00:07:36,638
I thought your father said you couldn't
use his bow. You're not ready.

103
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:38,680
I'm going to show him he was wrong.

104
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,860
I can hit that lantern with this.
Watch.

105
00:07:42,523 --> 00:07:43,960
Don't be so stupid!

106
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:53,560
Look what you've done!

107
00:07:56,081 --> 00:07:57,081
No!

108
00:08:16,402 --> 00:08:17,758
Seize the boy!

109
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
Help me!

110
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:38,708
Don't just stand there!
Somebody get a physician!

111
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:40,599
- Let me see him. I can help.
- Yousee?

112
00:08:41,193 --> 00:08:43,320
You see what your stupid
prank has done?

113
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,015
- I didn't do it.
- Who did?

114
00:08:45,135 --> 00:08:47,796
- It wasn't me!
- Of course it wasn't, Master Robin.

115
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,280
- You wouldn't fire at your own father.
- No, I swear.

116
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:53,257
He fired the arrow
that caused the priest's injuries.

117
00:08:53,377 --> 00:08:55,527
- He's a murderer!
- I didn't...

118
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,306
One of yours, Master Guy?

119
00:08:58,426 --> 00:09:00,480
- How dare you?
- It's not a question of daring,

120
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:01,715
but duty.

121
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,559
As bailiff, it's my job
to uphold the law.

122
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,240
I warn you only to hold the boy.

123
00:09:06,401 --> 00:09:08,440
Any further action
and you'll have me to answer to.

124
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,680
- What? No!
- He will only be charged if he dies.

125
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:14,760
- Get him to the manor, quickly.
- You heard her.

126
00:09:16,881 --> 00:09:18,919
Carefully! Carefully!

127
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:22,171
Everybody out. Leave us.
Let her work.

128
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,880
His rib is broken
and it has punctured a lung.

129
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,149
- His chest is filling with air.
- There must be something you can do.

130
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,313
Yes...

131
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,455
What are you doing?

132
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,720
- It will release the air.
- Father...

133
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:41,628
Just breathe.

134
00:09:41,973 --> 00:09:43,560
Careful. Better?

135
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,920
Father! They're going to hang Guy!

136
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:50,120
I can't leave him.
I cannot leave him.

137
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,760
I'll put an end to this.

138
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,800
Did you see the way she declared herself
Lady of the Manor?

139
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,729
She has no right to this estate!

140
00:10:01,849 --> 00:10:03,520
Like an eye for an eye.

141
00:10:04,243 --> 00:10:05,797
The boy must hang!

142
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:08,097
Have you taken leave of your senses?

143
00:10:08,217 --> 00:10:10,915
If you do this,
you will have to answer for it.

144
00:10:11,035 --> 00:10:13,240
We must all pay
for our actions, my lord.

145
00:10:13,401 --> 00:10:15,560
- You were told not to harm the boy.
- True.

146
00:10:16,554 --> 00:10:19,760
But now I feel compelled
by the will of the people,

147
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:23,200
<i>and they want justice,
and to that end...</i>

148
00:10:23,913 --> 00:10:25,600
- Then you force my hand...
- Stop!

149
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:28,080
- I command you to stop!
- On whose authority?

150
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:30,725
The King's, as he made me
lord of this manor.

151
00:10:30,845 --> 00:10:33,613
I'm Sir Roger of Gisborne,
this boy's father.

152
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,560
- No!
- What? You doubt my word?

153
00:10:36,986 --> 00:10:40,376
- We thought you were dead.
- I was captured, not killed.

154
00:10:40,496 --> 00:10:43,200
- Out of my way.
- I can't do that.

155
00:10:44,073 --> 00:10:46,273
As bailiff, I must uphold the law.

156
00:10:46,517 --> 00:10:49,117
You are no longer bailiff!
Out of my way!

157
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:05,400
You will never hold office again
as long as I'm lord of this manor.

158
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:08,440
He will live! Swain will live!

159
00:11:15,513 --> 00:11:16,520
Roger!

160
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,000
They told me...

161
00:11:21,161 --> 00:11:22,411
I was captured.

162
00:11:23,198 --> 00:11:26,440
- There was no way to get word to you.
- Captured? Did they hurt you?

163
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,900
I must talk with you
at once, Ghislaine.

164
00:11:34,712 --> 00:11:37,600
I was truly sorry
for what happened that night.

165
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:42,313
It was a mistake...
which I learnt from.

166
00:11:45,222 --> 00:11:47,560
And it was one that made me
a better man.

167
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,466
Do you think Mother watches me?

168
00:11:51,925 --> 00:11:53,040
From heaven?

169
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,759
I'm sure she does.

170
00:11:56,307 --> 00:11:58,607
I'm sure she sees everything you do.

171
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
Father...

172
00:12:06,597 --> 00:12:08,597
it was me that shot the arrow.

173
00:12:09,444 --> 00:12:10,944
I was showing off...

174
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,400
with your bow.

175
00:12:15,006 --> 00:12:15,840
Robin...

176
00:12:18,764 --> 00:12:21,368
one day you will be
lord of Locksley,

177
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:23,760
lord of my lands.

178
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:26,271
You must grow up
and learn to take responsibility

179
00:12:26,391 --> 00:12:28,291
when you do something wrong.

180
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,500
You could be
the best shot in England.

181
00:12:32,076 --> 00:12:34,560
You shouldn't stand by
and let something terrible happen

182
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,400
because you were too scared
to do the right thing.

183
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:39,739
Do you understand?

184
00:12:40,996 --> 00:12:41,996
Yes.

185
00:12:51,018 --> 00:12:52,168
How touching!

186
00:12:52,543 --> 00:12:53,543
Look,

187
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,448
I really don't see the point
of any of this.

188
00:12:56,568 --> 00:13:00,000
You need to know the truth...
to save a life.

189
00:13:17,968 --> 00:13:19,448
We should not do this.

190
00:13:19,568 --> 00:13:20,568
Malcolm...

191
00:13:21,674 --> 00:13:23,360
I've done what I thought was right.

192
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:25,879
I have stayed away from you.

193
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,360
You have no idea
how hard that's been.

194
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:29,892
Of course I do.

195
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:33,279
But you understand,
I had to care for Roger.

196
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:35,600
I understand more than you think.

197
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:37,845
I know about his affliction.

198
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:41,671
- How?
- The night of his return,

199
00:13:42,305 --> 00:13:45,920
Longthorn's dagger went straight through
his hand and he didn't even cry out.

200
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:54,574
He told me he was infected
in the Holy Land.

201
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:59,729
All he wanted was to get back home
and spend his last days with his family.

202
00:14:00,627 --> 00:14:03,773
He made his own way home,
away from his soldiers,

203
00:14:04,342 --> 00:14:05,942
so they wouldn't know.

204
00:14:06,097 --> 00:14:07,647
But people will know.

205
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:10,281
There is talk about the bandages.

206
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:12,072
The fact he barely
leaves your house.

207
00:14:12,192 --> 00:14:14,200
- He is a sick man!
- He is a leper!

208
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:18,400
If he is discovered,
you will all be cast out.

209
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:29,000
You should not have been put
in this position, Ghislaine.

210
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,133
There is something else.

211
00:15:01,128 --> 00:15:03,728
- More lies!
- There was never any child.

212
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,640
What are you doing?

213
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,000
If you think me a liar,
there's no point in you being here.

214
00:15:13,901 --> 00:15:16,400
You're going to kill me
with no means to defend myself?

215
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,200
I expected nothing less from you,
Bailiff Longthorn!

216
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:26,314
Hear my story or walk away.

217
00:15:26,897 --> 00:15:29,520
But if you do,
your brother will die.

218
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,460
Do you want that
on your consciences?

219
00:15:37,472 --> 00:15:38,720
Keep talking.

220
00:15:39,113 --> 00:15:40,441
You understand now?

221
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,200
I must go away.

222
00:15:42,598 --> 00:15:45,360
Roger will know for sure
this is not his child.

223
00:15:45,697 --> 00:15:48,854
Then I will declare my feelings for you
and we can be a family.

224
00:15:48,974 --> 00:15:50,600
But I am married to another man!

225
00:15:50,761 --> 00:15:53,722
If he is discovered,
he'll be banished from the village.

226
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:57,240
He'll be stripped of his title,
his lands. You will have nothing.

227
00:15:57,619 --> 00:15:58,964
Ghislaine, listen.

228
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:02,520
If he is declared a leper,
you will be given a choice.

229
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:04,800
You can declare yourself a widow.

230
00:16:06,024 --> 00:16:08,624
But that would be a lie!
In the eyes of God...

231
00:16:08,744 --> 00:16:11,120
In the eyes of the law,
you will be free of him.

232
00:16:12,301 --> 00:16:15,560
But the baby will show.
People will still know.

233
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:18,400
Roger has been back
a very short time.

234
00:16:18,756 --> 00:16:20,757
Then you will have
our baby in secret.

235
00:16:20,877 --> 00:16:22,600
I will arrange for it
to be taken away.

236
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,706
- No!
- Only for a short while!

237
00:16:26,642 --> 00:16:28,922
Once you are recovered
from the birth,

238
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:31,800
you can go on a pilgrimage
and bring him back.

239
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:34,808
Claim he is a foundling - an orphan.

240
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:37,688
With that, we can be a family.

241
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:57,600
Roger, I did not expect to see you.
I was restless.

242
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,210
I went for a ride.

243
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:00,768
Of course.

244
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:04,759
And on this ride,
did you happen to see anyone?

245
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:06,920
Malcolm Locksley, perhaps?

246
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:11,480
How did you know?

247
00:17:13,653 --> 00:17:15,279
Because I am your husband.

248
00:17:23,731 --> 00:17:25,831
And I have failed you as a wife.

249
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,240
No.

250
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:32,569
It is I who failed you...

251
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,840
leaving you alone
and returning like this.

252
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,154
No, Roger...

253
00:17:38,797 --> 00:17:42,680
You will never know how grateful I am
that you've kept my secret,

254
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:47,120
and allowed me to see out my days
with you and the children.

255
00:17:48,173 --> 00:17:49,423
And I'm glad...

256
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:53,508
you've found someone who will care
for you when I've gone.

257
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:00,760
All I ask...

258
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:04,400
is that he has the patience
to wait until that day.

259
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:09,288
Roger,

260
00:18:10,688 --> 00:18:11,720
you must go.

261
00:18:12,366 --> 00:18:13,416
Not for me,

262
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:16,595
for yourself - now.

263
00:18:17,913 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't understand.

264
00:18:19,434 --> 00:18:22,840
I'm sorry. I thought
that I was doing the right thing.

265
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,394
You must leave right away.

266
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,620
Not already...

267
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:39,965
Sir Roger,
I think you know why we're here.

268
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:14,400
Will you not show him mercy?

269
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:17,920
- I saved your life!
- I'm sorry. This is God's will.

270
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:34,600
- Roger of Gisborne, you are a leper,
- Mother, please.

271
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,779
And, as such, are to be cast out
from the society of others.

272
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:40,249
- No, don't let them do this.
- Guy!

273
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:43,000
You must act like a man
and not a child.

274
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:44,461
Do not shame me.

275
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:47,784
From this day forward,
you are deemed unclean.

276
00:19:48,047 --> 00:19:51,000
- Do you understand?
- I do.

277
00:19:51,922 --> 00:19:54,022
As his wife, you may go with him

278
00:19:54,356 --> 00:19:58,153
or you may declare yourself a widow
and be free of your impediment.

279
00:19:58,273 --> 00:20:00,480
Impediment? He is my husband!

280
00:20:00,641 --> 00:20:03,480
Ghislaine, you must set
an example for the children.

281
00:20:15,011 --> 00:20:16,240
Do you declare?

282
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,880
Yes.

283
00:20:23,565 --> 00:20:25,315
From today, I am a widow.

284
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:27,672
Very well.

285
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,000
Roger of Gisborne,

286
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:35,960
I forbid you ever to enter
any church, market,

287
00:20:36,393 --> 00:20:39,295
tavern or any assembly of people.

288
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:44,280
I forbid you to drink or eat
from any vessel but your own.

289
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:46,960
I forbid you to touch any child.

290
00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:52,997
Now you must leave this place.

291
00:21:20,485 --> 00:21:23,200
Thank you. Care for her.

292
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,320
Care for them all.

293
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:28,680
Father!

294
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:33,160
Get away from me!

295
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
You did this.

296
00:21:48,906 --> 00:21:50,556
I'll never forgive you.

297
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,200
<i>I'm not going in here.</i>

298
00:21:54,578 --> 00:21:56,505
- It's a leper's house.
- Shut your mouth!

299
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,644
- Why? It's true. Your father's a leper.
- Shut up!

300
00:21:59,764 --> 00:22:00,764
No!

301
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,398
It is a good thing your father
is not here to see this.

302
00:22:05,518 --> 00:22:07,200
He would be ashamed
of your behaviour.

303
00:22:09,003 --> 00:22:10,440
- Robin! No more.
- But he...

304
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,050
Imagine you had lost
what he has lost.

305
00:22:14,656 --> 00:22:17,256
Go and find him,
make your apologies. Go!

306
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:20,920
Lady Gisborne...

307
00:22:22,161 --> 00:22:23,511
... Lord Malcolm.

308
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:26,520
How fortuitous
to find you both together.

309
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:30,960
Have you told the children
the good news?

310
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:32,080
What?

311
00:22:32,627 --> 00:22:36,200
Do you think they'll want
a little brother or a sister?

312
00:22:39,993 --> 00:22:41,598
You've been spying on us?

313
00:22:41,718 --> 00:22:44,276
I've been looking for an opportunity
to get what I deserve -

314
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,814
lands of my own!

315
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,000
You will give me yours, lady,

316
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:52,480
unless you want everyone
to know your little secret.

317
00:22:54,968 --> 00:22:58,160
Very well. Go to Nottingham,
have the deeds drawn up.

318
00:23:00,188 --> 00:23:01,638
Thank you, my lord.

319
00:23:06,121 --> 00:23:08,005
Malcolm, the lands have
to pass to Guy.

320
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,325
And they will.

321
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,160
On Saturday, we shall be married.

322
00:23:11,321 --> 00:23:15,204
Your lands will become mine
and Longthorn's deeds will be worthless.

323
00:23:15,324 --> 00:23:17,800
Saturday? The children
have just lost their father!

324
00:23:18,888 --> 00:23:20,400
But we must marry soon.

325
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,061
They never married.

326
00:23:26,177 --> 00:23:29,011
No, they only ever planned to.

327
00:23:30,637 --> 00:23:31,960
Didn't they, Guy?

328
00:23:35,606 --> 00:23:36,640
You knew?

329
00:23:38,778 --> 00:23:39,879
I found out.

330
00:23:42,742 --> 00:23:45,642
I saw my mother
making her way into the forest,

331
00:23:47,068 --> 00:23:48,468
and so I followed.

332
00:23:51,524 --> 00:23:53,029
She still loved him.

333
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:59,049
I was so angry.
She told me that I had to forget him...

334
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:02,636
pretend that he didn't exist.

335
00:24:03,113 --> 00:24:04,463
Yet here she was,

336
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,370
denying me my father.

337
00:24:22,258 --> 00:24:24,259
- How could you?
- Guy!

338
00:24:24,675 --> 00:24:27,400
- You frightened me.
- I saw you with Father. You said...

339
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:29,511
I could not just abandon him.

340
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:31,440
He needs care.

341
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:33,720
- You said he was gone.
- I know.

342
00:24:33,881 --> 00:24:36,680
Did Malcolm make you do it?
I've seen how he looks at you.

343
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:40,320
- He wants you for himself.
- Malcolm is a good man, Guy.

344
00:24:41,177 --> 00:24:44,485
He can take care of us
now that your father cannot.

345
00:24:46,668 --> 00:24:49,760
- We are to be married.
- Married?

346
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,899
Yes, on Saturday.
It is for the best.

347
00:24:53,217 --> 00:24:54,567
All will be well.

348
00:24:55,386 --> 00:24:58,440
But you must promise
not to speak of it until it is done.

349
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,832
- Why? Why must it be a secret?
- Just promise me.

350
00:25:02,076 --> 00:25:04,840
You must tell no one,
especially Robin.

351
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:09,153
- He must hear it from his father.
- You don't have to do this, Mother.

352
00:25:09,273 --> 00:25:12,277
Let's leave Nottingham, go back
to France, take Father with us.

353
00:25:12,397 --> 00:25:14,897
- We'll be together...
- No. <i>Mon dieu !</i>

354
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:16,647
What is it?

355
00:25:17,128 --> 00:25:18,480
Get help! Get help!

356
00:25:20,097 --> 00:25:22,240
Hurry, Guy, please!

357
00:25:23,093 --> 00:25:24,693
I'd never run so fast.

358
00:25:26,312 --> 00:25:28,862
- I thought that...
- She was in labour.

359
00:25:36,456 --> 00:25:37,706
I see that now.

360
00:25:38,402 --> 00:25:40,040
What happened to the baby?

361
00:25:40,992 --> 00:25:42,242
He was early...

362
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:44,739
but strong.

363
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
Look.

364
00:25:54,793 --> 00:25:56,143
He is so quiet...

365
00:25:57,265 --> 00:25:59,165
like he knows he's a secret.

366
00:26:00,998 --> 00:26:02,348
And look at this.

367
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,540
My son,

368
00:26:08,195 --> 00:26:11,151
by this mark,
you will never be lost to me.

369
00:26:12,461 --> 00:26:13,560
Ghislaine...

370
00:26:13,915 --> 00:26:15,665
I have thought of a name.

371
00:26:15,948 --> 00:26:16,948
Archer.

372
00:26:18,298 --> 00:26:19,600
Do you think it suits?

373
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:21,440
I do.

374
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:24,720
But it's...

375
00:26:25,421 --> 00:26:27,075
I know. It is time.

376
00:26:38,908 --> 00:26:41,458
The baby was to be taken
to a safe place

377
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:45,535
until the parents could marry
and reclaim him.

378
00:26:50,336 --> 00:26:51,840
You ride carefully.

379
00:26:52,261 --> 00:26:53,680
You carry precious cargo.

380
00:26:54,843 --> 00:26:55,843
Go.

381
00:26:58,442 --> 00:27:02,000
And that was the last he or Ghislaine
ever saw of their son.

382
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,400
Father?

383
00:27:26,335 --> 00:27:27,759
My son. Wh...?

384
00:27:30,502 --> 00:27:31,520
Come with me.

385
00:27:36,653 --> 00:27:38,938
You should not have come here.

386
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:40,809
I needed to tell you something.

387
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:42,840
Malcolm Locksley is forcing
Mother to marry him.

388
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:47,046
The wedding is tomorrow.
You must stop them.

389
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,080
No.

390
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,960
That's no longer my right.

391
00:27:52,634 --> 00:27:55,658
You must try and understand.
Your mother needs a husband,

392
00:27:55,778 --> 00:27:58,320
- and you need a father.
- I thought I already had one.

393
00:27:58,481 --> 00:28:00,469
- Guy...
- I thought you loved us,

394
00:28:00,589 --> 00:28:02,040
even when you went to the war.

395
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:04,501
But you can't love us.

396
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:08,785
If you did, you'd never let this happen.
If you did, you'd fight for us!

397
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:10,749
Leave me be.

398
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
Leper.

399
00:28:35,683 --> 00:28:37,308
I've readied an altar in the woods.

400
00:28:37,428 --> 00:28:40,280
He's back - the leper, Guy's father!

401
00:28:41,412 --> 00:28:42,912
He's in their house.

402
00:28:47,235 --> 00:28:48,080
Hold!

403
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,635
- What's going on?
- The leper's back.

404
00:28:53,493 --> 00:28:54,849
Do you hear that?

405
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,360
The leper's back,

406
00:28:59,022 --> 00:29:01,122
... risking all our lives again!

407
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:02,360
Come on.

408
00:29:03,591 --> 00:29:04,591
Come on!

409
00:29:07,357 --> 00:29:08,440
Where is he?

410
00:29:16,785 --> 00:29:20,535
- Out of my way, boy.
- {\No! }Not after what you did to my father!

411
00:29:31,641 --> 00:29:34,491
Get out! Get out!
Get your sister out of here!

412
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:45,600
Ghislaine, there is a fire.
You must leave now.

413
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:50,356
You were told not to return.

414
00:29:50,881 --> 00:29:53,360
You expected me to stay away
whilst you stole my wife?

415
00:29:53,521 --> 00:29:56,480
Your wife? The woman
that you abandoned for years?

416
00:29:57,369 --> 00:29:58,680
Oh, please don't do this!

417
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:02,120
- Why are you not leaving? Go! Go!
- Not without you. Both of you!

418
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,536
I was wrong...
to give up without a fight.

419
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,670
I see clearly now,

420
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:10,160
how you had things planned
from the moment I returned.

421
00:30:10,321 --> 00:30:12,571
You brought disease to your family!

422
00:30:13,056 --> 00:30:16,063
If you loved them,
you would have stayed away.

423
00:30:16,183 --> 00:30:18,145
You know nothing of our love.

424
00:30:18,422 --> 00:30:21,853
It was she who came to me
in the leper colony.

425
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,825
But perhaps, your hold over her

426
00:30:26,023 --> 00:30:27,800
wasn't as strong as you thought.

427
00:30:30,344 --> 00:30:31,800
Malcolm! Malcolm!

428
00:30:32,385 --> 00:30:35,400
He is my husband,
the father of my children!

429
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,256
And so am I!

430
00:30:39,572 --> 00:30:40,600
Our son.

431
00:30:43,249 --> 00:30:45,040
There is a child?!

432
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:56,840
Look! Sir Malcolm
is burning the place!

433
00:30:57,001 --> 00:30:58,560
No! It was an accident.

434
00:30:58,721 --> 00:31:00,680
The only way
to get rid of the disease!

435
00:31:00,841 --> 00:31:02,640
- Come on!
- No, you're wrong!

436
00:31:02,801 --> 00:31:05,139
- Don't do this!
- Stop! Stop!

437
00:31:06,075 --> 00:31:08,040
Wait! My father's inside!

438
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:10,039
No! No!

439
00:31:11,145 --> 00:31:12,845
I should have saved her.

440
00:31:15,338 --> 00:31:17,438
I should have braved the flames.

441
00:31:20,784 --> 00:31:24,000
- It would have been too late.
- You don't know that.

442
00:31:24,663 --> 00:31:26,400
She was already dead.

443
00:31:29,273 --> 00:31:30,304
No!

444
00:31:50,893 --> 00:31:51,893
Please!

445
00:31:52,843 --> 00:31:54,505
This solves nothing.

446
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:55,800
Enough!

447
00:32:30,594 --> 00:32:31,760
She's dead.

448
00:32:48,321 --> 00:32:49,200
Get off!

449
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:53,775
What will that achieve?

450
00:32:54,459 --> 00:32:57,160
- He didn't kill Ghislaine.
- No, but his father did.

451
00:32:57,321 --> 00:33:00,121
- And as his father's dead...
- No, he isn't.

452
00:33:02,436 --> 00:33:03,840
Explain yourself.

453
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:13,075
Go.

454
00:33:16,991 --> 00:33:19,160
My children will be better off
without me...

455
00:33:20,726 --> 00:33:24,720
and I wish only to spend
my last moments with my wife...

456
00:33:26,036 --> 00:33:27,040
alone.

457
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:30,092
Please!

458
00:33:50,711 --> 00:33:54,000
- Robin!
- Let me go! My father's inside!

459
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:57,908
Yours, too! And your mother!
Do something!

460
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,409
Get off me!

461
00:34:03,597 --> 00:34:06,296
My father would never
have left me alone!

462
00:34:17,729 --> 00:34:18,729
No...

463
00:34:24,226 --> 00:34:25,226
No!

464
00:34:29,774 --> 00:34:31,119
I'm sorry, Robin.

465
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,620
No!

466
00:34:35,387 --> 00:34:37,040
I mourned for you!

467
00:34:41,729 --> 00:34:43,280
How could I be your father...

468
00:34:44,392 --> 00:34:45,800
after what I had done?

469
00:34:47,746 --> 00:34:50,196
After all I'd taught you
about honour?

470
00:34:51,266 --> 00:34:52,266
Robin...

471
00:34:55,201 --> 00:34:58,051
I couldn't bear to see the shame
in your eyes.

472
00:35:03,078 --> 00:35:04,366
You killed her.

473
00:35:05,716 --> 00:35:08,080
All these years,
I thought it was my fault,

474
00:35:09,102 --> 00:35:11,400
<i>that my parents died
because of the fire that I started,</i>

475
00:35:11,561 --> 00:35:13,000
but it was you.

476
00:35:15,223 --> 00:35:17,373
That guilt was with me every day.

477
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:19,550
Every day!

478
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,770
Get off him!

479
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:24,040
Can't you see he deserves this?
He betrayed us both!

480
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,450
You're right.

481
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:29,754
Death would be a release.

482
00:35:30,988 --> 00:35:32,938
There have been many times...

483
00:35:33,372 --> 00:35:35,520
when I've been tempted
to do the job myself.

484
00:35:35,681 --> 00:35:38,129
And you expect us
to feel sorry for you?

485
00:35:38,249 --> 00:35:39,360
Of course not.

486
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,840
So why now?
Why tell us after all this time?

487
00:35:43,098 --> 00:35:44,798
Because of your brother.

488
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:48,280
I need you to forgive each other,

489
00:35:51,881 --> 00:35:53,480
so that you can unite

490
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,392
- and save him.
- This again!

491
00:35:56,695 --> 00:35:59,245
Everything I have told you
is the truth.

492
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:01,571
And I have told you

493
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,600
so you don't destroy each other,

494
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,960
like your fathers.

495
00:36:09,195 --> 00:36:10,200
Son...

496
00:36:10,658 --> 00:36:11,658
No.

497
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,880
You lost the right to call me son
when you left me alone in the world.

498
00:36:23,301 --> 00:36:24,400
Maybe.

499
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:28,440
But didn't it make you
the man you are today?

500
00:36:34,322 --> 00:36:35,480
Children...

501
00:36:36,873 --> 00:36:39,723
we've searched what is left
of Gisborne Manor.

502
00:36:40,924 --> 00:36:42,174
Your parents...

503
00:36:43,715 --> 00:36:46,320
- there's nothing left.
- You killed them!

504
00:36:47,742 --> 00:36:50,960
- All of you, you murdered them.
- You started the fire, boy.

505
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:57,848
That's right, you go back
to where you came from.

506
00:36:57,968 --> 00:37:01,040
News of your father's shame
won't have reached France yet.

507
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,600
You're no longer welcome
anywhere near my lands.

508
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,770
YOUR lands?

509
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,280
Longthorn,

510
00:37:08,681 --> 00:37:11,831
you are not a noble.
You have no right to this land.

511
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:14,623
The village will become part
of the Locksley estate again.

512
00:37:14,743 --> 00:37:16,593
They are Robin's lands now.

513
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,360
Me?

514
00:37:18,521 --> 00:37:21,080
Him? You run along.

515
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:23,666
There's no room
for you here now, either.

516
00:37:23,786 --> 00:37:26,440
Robin, he's stealing from you,
from your poor father.

517
00:37:26,601 --> 00:37:28,551
I'm doing the boy a kindness.

518
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,800
Do you really think
you can run this estate, boy,

519
00:37:33,138 --> 00:37:36,920
feed the people when they're hungry,
clothe them when they freeze?

520
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,272
You're just a child.

521
00:37:42,706 --> 00:37:45,600
- Robin!
- I thought not. The duty falls to me.

522
00:37:46,173 --> 00:37:48,440
Right, let's start as we mean
to go on, shall we?

523
00:37:49,025 --> 00:37:50,313
Tax collection.

524
00:38:02,394 --> 00:38:04,094
I don't know what to do.

525
00:38:11,003 --> 00:38:13,619
<i>You shouldn't stand by
and let something terrible happen</i>

526
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:16,789
<i>because you were too scared
to do the right thing.</i>

527
00:38:42,723 --> 00:38:43,723
Thank you.

528
00:38:45,376 --> 00:38:46,376
Thank you.

529
00:38:49,016 --> 00:38:50,521
<i>Leave us alone!</i>

530
00:38:56,693 --> 00:38:57,720
Leave them be!

531
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,090
Ignore him.

532
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:07,920
Next time, I won't miss.

533
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:10,160
You stupid little boy!

534
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,890
My father never struck me.
Neither will you.

535
00:39:16,326 --> 00:39:20,276
These are my people and I will care
for them, as my father intended.

536
00:39:21,148 --> 00:39:22,840
I am lord of the manor now.

537
00:39:23,262 --> 00:39:25,120
We'll see how long that lasts.

538
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:28,640
Wait till you have to deal with
your first poor harvest or bad winter.

539
00:39:28,932 --> 00:39:31,680
- You'll be begging for help.
- And he will have it.

540
00:39:32,259 --> 00:39:36,015
What? From a simpering priest
and a few villagers?

541
00:39:45,695 --> 00:39:47,377
<i>Go on, get out of here.</i>

542
00:40:03,261 --> 00:40:05,960
Both of your lives
could have been so different,

543
00:40:06,121 --> 00:40:09,426
were it not for the...
mistakes your parents made.

544
00:40:09,881 --> 00:40:12,280
We can't change that,
and I can never forgive Guy.

545
00:40:12,441 --> 00:40:13,320
Why not?

546
00:40:14,566 --> 00:40:16,560
Because he showed no remorse
for {\what he did to }Marian.

547
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:19,183
- You know nothing.
- You worked and killed for the Sheriff

548
00:40:19,303 --> 00:40:21,314
- for years.
- You'd still be under his power

549
00:40:21,434 --> 00:40:24,585
- were it not for me!
- What do you mean, "for you"?

550
00:40:32,316 --> 00:40:36,166
- You killed the Sheriff.
- And I intend to kill the new one, too.

551
00:40:36,626 --> 00:40:38,480
First, join and save your brother.

552
00:40:39,528 --> 00:40:41,878
- You know where he is?
- Finally...

553
00:40:42,984 --> 00:40:45,040
after many years of searching.

554
00:40:45,564 --> 00:40:47,564
I thought if I could find him,

555
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:51,191
tell him the truth about
who he was...

556
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,723
It seemed the right thing to do...
for Ghislaine.

557
00:40:57,554 --> 00:40:58,960
It wasn't easy.

558
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:01,560
He doesn't stay
in the same place for long,

559
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:04,378
but now he has no choice.

560
00:41:07,207 --> 00:41:08,307
Where is he?

561
00:41:09,497 --> 00:41:10,497
York jail.

562
00:41:11,654 --> 00:41:13,040
He is to hang.

563
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,360
I'm too sick to help.

564
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:19,160
I'm dying, Robin.

565
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:24,414
Father...

566
00:41:25,512 --> 00:41:27,162
You are my last chance.

567
00:41:28,548 --> 00:41:30,998
Together, I know
you can both do this.

568
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:32,948
Remember the birthmark...

569
00:41:33,481 --> 00:41:35,281
shaped like an arrow-head.

570
00:41:37,152 --> 00:41:40,120
That is why your mother
named him Archer.

571
00:41:41,996 --> 00:41:43,280
You'll do this for me?

572
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,806
I won't let him die, Father.

573
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:08,240
I wish I could see
you three together at last.

574
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:13,080
- Well, surely we have more time...
- I'm sorry.

575
00:42:14,387 --> 00:42:15,387
No!

576
00:42:19,024 --> 00:42:21,674
Look, I have no desire
to see you again...

577
00:42:30,329 --> 00:42:31,379
Save him...

578
00:42:35,498 --> 00:42:37,198
... and save yourselves.

579
00:43:03,601 --> 00:43:05,520
Gisborne... Enough.

580
00:43:08,413 --> 00:43:09,563
No more talk.

581
00:43:11,957 --> 00:43:14,907
- But what do you think we should...?
- To York.

582
00:43:41,441 --> 00:43:44,641
Gisborne has chosen to join us
in our struggle, John.

583
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,200
Our brother is in jail in York,
awaiting execution.

584
00:43:48,361 --> 00:43:50,760
- Who is this brother, Robin?
- I'm Archer.

585
00:43:50,921 --> 00:43:53,201
He brings back mysteries
from the Orient, Harold.

586
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,240
Me and Gisborne will go to York
and bring him back.

587
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,680
Go to the Sheriff of York.

588
00:43:57,962 --> 00:44:01,520
Tell him I will offer 100 crowns
for their heads.

589
00:44:02,814 --> 00:44:03,880
Stop!

590
00:44:04,961 --> 00:44:06,360
Prepare them all to die.
