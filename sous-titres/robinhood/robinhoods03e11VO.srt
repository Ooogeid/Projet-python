1
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,200
We'll go no further
unless I know I can trust you.

2
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:19,560
I can't just betray the others
and bring you to the camp.

3
00:00:20,299 --> 00:00:21,649
You can trust me.

4
00:00:23,016 --> 00:00:25,320
Just don't ask me
to forgive your father.

5
00:00:25,888 --> 00:00:27,800
Now, you listen to me, Gisborne.

6
00:00:28,993 --> 00:00:32,743
If we're gonna work together,
then we have to leave that behind.

7
00:00:33,276 --> 00:00:34,800
That's easy for you to say.

8
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:37,109
Your father seduced my mother.

9
00:00:37,557 --> 00:00:39,960
Well, it didn't take
much effort, did it?

10
00:01:09,683 --> 00:01:11,333
<i>Everyone, quick, hurry!</i>

11
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,570
Robin's in trouble!

12
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:17,480
Hey! Robin's fighting Gisborne
over the hill.

13
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:19,960
I don't know who else is there.
Come on. Come on!

14
00:01:27,794 --> 00:01:30,520
You kill my wife
and you expect forgiveness?!

15
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,600
I loved her as you loved her.

16
00:01:36,857 --> 00:01:39,200
I'll never ask for your forgiveness.

17
00:01:43,596 --> 00:01:45,800
- I can't forgive myself.
- What?

18
00:01:55,255 --> 00:01:56,679
<i>Get back!</i>

19
00:01:59,072 --> 00:02:00,122
Get off me!

20
00:02:00,516 --> 00:02:01,566
Get off me!

21
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
NO!

22
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,200
He killed my brother!

23
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:07,920
- He's oneof us.
- What?

24
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,119
I said, "He's one of us!"

25
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:24,160
The Sub Wood Team

26
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,000
Episode 11
THE ENNEMY OF MY ENNEMY

27
00:02:59,161 --> 00:03:01,000
So that's where you've been,
then, with him?!

28
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:03,565
I've been with my father, John.

29
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:06,604
- I thought your father was dead.
- So did I.

30
00:03:06,724 --> 00:03:09,674
He's not one of us, Robin.
And he never will be!

31
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:13,211
Gisborne has chosen to join us
in our struggle, John.

32
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,120
You can't trust him!

33
00:03:15,437 --> 00:03:16,800
He killed the Sheriff.

34
00:03:18,267 --> 00:03:20,160
And we're almost family,
aren't we, Robin?

35
00:03:21,321 --> 00:03:24,360
- We share a brother.
- What?! A brother?

36
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:28,112
Both of you?

37
00:03:28,518 --> 00:03:29,618
My father...

38
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:32,693
his mother.

39
00:03:33,154 --> 00:03:35,204
Our brother is in jail in York,

40
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:37,440
... awaiting execution.

41
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:41,583
And I promised my dying father -
and I intend to honour it -

42
00:03:43,096 --> 00:03:46,675
me and Gisborne will go to York and
bring him back. If it were any of you,

43
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:48,120
you know I'd do the same.

44
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,720
And who'll bring my brother
back to me, Robin?

45
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:53,040
- No one stopped his execution.
- Look,

46
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:56,404
like it or not,
we share a common goal -

47
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,160
to destroy Isabella.

48
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:01,486
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

49
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:05,200
You don't have to like me.
I don't like you.

50
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,421
- But you need me.
- We don't need you.

51
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,080
If he can help rid us of Isabella,

52
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:11,800
He's pure evil! Robin?!

53
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:14,720
Do you still believe
good conquers evil?

54
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,513
You need me to defeat Isabella,

55
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:18,439
and to do that
we need our brother in York.

56
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,700
- Who is this brother, Robin?
- His name is Archer.

57
00:04:22,016 --> 00:04:23,316
We've never met.

58
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:27,086
All I know is
he's travelled far and wide

59
00:04:27,206 --> 00:04:29,840
and has a knowledge of exotic weapons
brought back from the East.

60
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:32,569
Isabella's forces
are far greater than ours.

61
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,040
Archer's weapons
will make us stronger.

62
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:36,640
We all go.

63
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:39,414
And who will protect the people
from Isabella?

64
00:04:39,534 --> 00:04:42,841
- Well, who's gonna protect you?
- Much, I'll be safe.

65
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,400
No-one is gonna recognise
me and Gisborne in York.

66
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:48,817
I'll be back soon.

67
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:56,576
Kate...

68
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,960
You know I wish
I could bring your brother back.

69
00:05:06,387 --> 00:05:07,387
Just...

70
00:05:08,218 --> 00:05:11,418
- Just don't trust him, Robin.
- I have to trust him.

71
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:15,520
And you have to trust me
that I'm doing the right thing.

72
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:18,840
Come back to me safely.

73
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
I will.

74
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:48,720
<i>Archer, it's time.</i>

75
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:52,719
God have mercy on you.

76
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:05,029
Rest in peace.

77
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,320
- Is there any news on my brother?
- No, Sheriff.

78
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,376
- And nothing on Hood?
- No.

79
00:06:24,496 --> 00:06:26,118
This is Lipscomb, Sheriff.

80
00:06:26,238 --> 00:06:28,797
He collects the toll for you
from the Great North Road.

81
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:29,920
Thank you.

82
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:33,561
Your loyalties will be rewarded,
I assure you.

83
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:37,200
And if you hear or see anything,
you report to me immediately.

84
00:06:37,775 --> 00:06:40,584
Hood and his men are spreading
terror throughout Nottingham.

85
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:44,339
Your help in finding
them keeps us all safe. Here.

86
00:06:47,612 --> 00:06:51,320
Let's hope this Judas does better
than the last one I paid for.

87
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,853
I want them found.

88
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:10,838
You are glorious, Gweneth.

89
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:12,388
Am I?

90
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,080
I'm not sure my husband would agree.

91
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:17,527
The Sheriff of York is a fool

92
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:21,489
to neglect such a passionate,
beautiful woman.

93
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:25,093
Yes, well, I don't like to complain

94
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,590
but sometimes I just feel
so under-appreciated.

95
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,640
Well, shall we do
something about that?

96
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,200
Toll house. 

97
00:07:44,356 --> 00:07:46,000
It's not worth the risk.

98
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:48,360
Well, they collect money
for Isabella.

99
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,890
Robbing them is robbing her.

100
00:07:57,349 --> 00:07:58,895
Don't... move.

101
00:08:05,464 --> 00:08:06,920
Is that everything?

102
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,519
Let's go.

103
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:10,216
Stay on your knees.

104
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:22,390
I really must go to the dungeon
before your husband comes back.

105
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,520
Yes, the Sheriff would be
very upset.

106
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,840
Yes, he would.

107
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:30,312
- He is the most powerful man in York.
- Yes, he is.

108
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:33,680
And if you're as fond of me
as I am of you...

109
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,080
You know how fond I am of you.

110
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,150
Then perhaps you might speak to him
about not hanging me, next week.

111
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:45,280
You can tell him that I fully intend to
deliver the weapons his cousin paid for.

112
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:46,880
It's all a big mistake.

113
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,340
I'm completely innocent.

114
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:53,959
- You heard the part about the hanging?
- Yes, of course.

115
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:58,079
Then if you find a good moment,
you might want to suggest some sort of

116
00:08:58,337 --> 00:08:59,387
... pardon.

117
00:09:00,955 --> 00:09:04,255
And I will show him
one of the mysteries of the Orient.

118
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:08,360
- Like the one you showed me?
- Not quite the same one.

119
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:13,160
You see, this is the mystery
of how something glittering

120
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:14,787
and precious,

121
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:16,925
like you...

122
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,725
can be made out of base metal.

123
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,560
The alchemist's art

124
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,440
... of making gold.

125
00:09:33,397 --> 00:09:35,297
Ever since I've known you...

126
00:09:36,502 --> 00:09:39,539
you make me feel so... alive.

127
00:09:40,176 --> 00:09:43,640
And it would be a shame
if anything were to happen to me

128
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,910
that might interfere with that...

129
00:09:46,374 --> 00:09:48,040
alive feeling.

130
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:54,426
By the way...

131
00:09:55,121 --> 00:09:57,841
You didn't happen to bring
any food with you, did you?

132
00:09:57,961 --> 00:10:01,061
It was a big success
with the other lads last time.

133
00:10:07,304 --> 00:10:08,954
Thank you, my good man.

134
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:13,680
- You said they were gonna kill ya.
- Probably next time.

135
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:15,240
You said that last time.

136
00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:19,160
Hungry?

137
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,480
I'll take offers.

138
00:10:24,765 --> 00:10:27,396
I'll give you 10 gold coins...

139
00:10:28,011 --> 00:10:29,320
for that sausage.

140
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,910
I accept.

141
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:42,327
Good as gold.

142
00:10:46,251 --> 00:10:49,080
Eat up, lads!
Enjoy the fruits of my labour.

143
00:10:49,952 --> 00:10:52,960
And you are certain he saw
my brother and Robin Hood together?

144
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,680
- Yes, Sheriff.
- Together?

145
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,763
They hate each other.
Why would they be working together?

146
00:11:02,176 --> 00:11:04,115
Two men who hate each other

147
00:11:04,235 --> 00:11:08,235
can only be brought together by a shared
hatred greater than their own.

148
00:11:09,172 --> 00:11:11,640
What? And you said they were
on their way to York?

149
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:14,451
- Yes, Sheriff.
- York? But then why York?

150
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:17,269
To what purpose
are they working together?

151
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:19,269
Do you think
they're plotting against me?

152
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:21,460
I know nothing more, Sheriff.

153
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:28,280
Then you must go to York immediately,
as my emissary.

154
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,640
I'll assemble soldiers
and I will follow you.

155
00:11:32,613 --> 00:11:34,413
Go to the Sheriff of York.

156
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:37,712
Warn him...
that two murderous scoundrels

157
00:11:37,832 --> 00:11:41,132
are fouling his domain,
Guy of Gisborne and Robin Hood.

158
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,060
Tell him...

159
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:47,280
I will offer 100 crowns
for their heads... each.

160
00:11:49,428 --> 00:11:50,440
Alive.

161
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:55,285
Oh, yes.

162
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:57,840
I want them alive.

163
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:21,801
<i>Left turn!</i>

164
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:24,266
<i>And at ease!</i>

165
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:27,148
He's inside there.

166
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:30,438
Well, it can't be that difficult,
can it?

167
00:12:34,113 --> 00:12:35,880
Robin working with Gisborne
could help us.

168
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:38,202
It will show the power of Robin Hood

169
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:41,782
and the nobility of our cause that it
can change his enemy into his friend.

170
00:12:41,902 --> 00:12:42,920
Show who?

171
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,600
The people of Locksley hate him.
The people of Nottingham hate him.

172
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:46,960
Everyone hates him.

173
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,360
Robin doesn't seem to care
about the crimes Gisborne's committed.

174
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,080
He's bringing us Gisborne
and {\he's bringing us }his brother to fight alongside.

175
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:58,401
We are striving not just
to protect Nottingham, but England!

176
00:12:58,557 --> 00:13:00,240
Not to settle old scores, John.

177
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,960
It's not about settling scores, Tuck.
It's about justice!

178
00:13:04,396 --> 00:13:06,207
If Robin feels
he can work with Gisborne,

179
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,097
Then Robin is wrong!

180
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:13,160
We fight to protect people
from animals like Gisborne.

181
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:18,363
Kate's brother was murdered
by Gisborne

182
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:20,120
and he hasn't been punished!

183
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,438
And I'm prepared to trust Robin.

184
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:23,520
What?

185
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:30,080
If he can bring Gisborne into our forest
and call him one of us...

186
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:37,801
Hey, John... John?

187
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,960
- Is this petty thief the one you mean?
- Yes, Harold.

188
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,867
With all due respect, Sheriff,

189
00:13:58,987 --> 00:14:01,560
I have to object
to the use of the word "petty".

190
00:14:03,771 --> 00:14:05,719
Go ahead and use it, if you like.

191
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:06,960
I know you.

192
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,840
You're the one who took money
from my cousin

193
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:12,766
but never delivered the weapons
he purchased.

194
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,336
A misunderstanding.

195
00:14:14,535 --> 00:14:16,680
He brings back mysteries
from the Orient, Harold.

196
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:19,277
More than one.

197
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,480
What kind of mysteries?

198
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:22,641
Alchemy.

199
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,259
You have the power of alchemy?

200
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:28,771
It's not a power, my lord.
It's a science.

201
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:32,040
A science of the East.

202
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,128
But what it can do... brings power.

203
00:14:41,405 --> 00:14:42,555
Where's John?

204
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:45,840
- Is he not back yet?
- No.

205
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:47,920
Right. I'll find him.

206
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,923
Do we have the nail?

207
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,004
Harold.

208
00:15:12,614 --> 00:15:13,614
M'lady.

209
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:29,479
Now, this can only be
the smallest of demonstrations,

210
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:32,696
due to the limited amount
of magic powder I have.

211
00:15:32,816 --> 00:15:33,840
Of course.

212
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:57,289
I told you.

213
00:15:59,207 --> 00:16:00,857
You can make more gold?

214
00:16:01,412 --> 00:16:03,012
Not if I'm a prisoner.

215
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,070
MAN:Sir, have a look at this.

216
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:26,040
<i>As far as I know, yep.</i>

217
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,920
<i>I'm doing the rounds again
in five minutes, so I'll check them.</i>

218
00:16:32,962 --> 00:16:34,175
{\The place}It's heavily fortified,

219
00:16:34,295 --> 00:16:36,695
- guards on every entrance.
- I know.

220
00:16:36,824 --> 00:16:39,022
I think the only way in
is to get invited.

221
00:16:39,142 --> 00:16:42,042
Even if we are,
how do we get into the dungeon?

222
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,785
It's a bit insulting he doesn't trust me
to come back with the powder...

223
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:49,905
on my own.

224
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,535
Why don't you just shut up?!

225
00:17:00,457 --> 00:17:01,800
He was right not to trust me.

226
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,920
Archer...

227
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,523
I was rather hoping
you'd take me with you.

228
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:07,643
Gweneth,

229
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:10,960
I am so grateful for everything
you've done for me.

230
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:14,520
But I think we should try
to resist each other, don't you?

231
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,760
<i>Lock the gates!</i>

232
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,279
Archer, quick! Here.

233
00:17:21,313 --> 00:17:22,913
We'll be safe in here.

234
00:17:30,251 --> 00:17:32,440
<i>Gweneth! It's not real gold.
The man's a fraud.</i>

235
00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:36,360
No.

236
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:39,640
Oh, no, Gweneth.

237
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:41,480
How could you?

238
00:17:44,598 --> 00:17:47,800
I understand why you were so desperate
to have him pardoned.

239
00:17:48,852 --> 00:17:50,680
I loved you so much.

240
00:17:54,645 --> 00:17:57,160
Take them both to the dungeon...

241
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:00,960
and prepare them to be put to death.

242
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:07,440
How could you do this to me?

243
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:08,800
She didn't.

244
00:18:09,765 --> 00:18:11,065
It was my fault.

245
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:15,693
I forced her into the bedchamber
and she resisted.

246
00:18:15,813 --> 00:18:17,567
My lord, she fought me off

247
00:18:17,687 --> 00:18:20,600
and then you entered and,
like the coward I am, I tried to hide.

248
00:18:22,328 --> 00:18:24,920
And I beg your for... forgiveness.

249
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:33,088
It's true.

250
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:37,240
Of course it is.

251
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,480
I... never doubted you
for one moment.

252
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:53,920
I sentence this fraud
to be put to death tomorrow.

253
00:18:55,104 --> 00:18:58,800
He will be boiled in oil before
his head is removed from his body,

254
00:18:58,961 --> 00:19:02,323
and his entrails,
as well as another part of his body,

255
00:19:02,443 --> 00:19:04,327
are fed to the pigs.

256
00:19:05,053 --> 00:19:07,560
- I don't suppose there's any...
- Take him away.

257
00:19:18,815 --> 00:19:19,640
<i>John!</i>

258
00:19:21,324 --> 00:19:22,324
<i>Come on.</i>

259
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,640
<i>Hey?</i>

260
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,060
John?

261
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:29,427
What are you doing?
I've been looking everywhere for you.

262
00:19:29,547 --> 00:19:31,447
- John?
- I don't want company.

263
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,967
- Hey, come back.
- I've had enough!

264
00:19:34,962 --> 00:19:36,643
Robin betrayed us!

265
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,911
Bringing... Gisborne!

266
00:19:45,442 --> 00:19:46,542
Leave me be.

267
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,320
Leave... me... be.

268
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,440
I am.

269
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,216
Then why are you walking beside me?

270
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:55,641
- Maybe we're going to the same place.
- Maybe we are.

271
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,520
You still don't need to walk beside me.
There're many roads to the same place.

272
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,640
Yes, there are.

273
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:02,680
We all believe
the same things, John.

274
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:05,640
- Yeah, well, I don't know that I do.
- Well, I know we do, eh?

275
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:08,547
I know we need you around,
all right?

276
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:11,120
To remind us who it is
we're fighting for here.

277
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:13,560
All right? We're lost without you.

278
00:20:16,004 --> 00:20:17,440
No. Go... away!

279
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:40,241
After him!

280
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:56,760
So, tell me,
where were you going, John?

281
00:20:57,001 --> 00:20:59,843
To your camp... or to York?

282
00:21:02,121 --> 00:21:03,994
I'll deal with him when I get back.

283
00:21:04,114 --> 00:21:06,800
Take him to the castle
and lock him up.

284
00:21:10,173 --> 00:21:12,080
So we've got
two fairly difficult problems -

285
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,650
one, we don't know
what he looks like.

286
00:21:15,892 --> 00:21:18,292
We'll recognise him
by his birthmark.

287
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,833
Don't worry. 

288
00:21:19,953 --> 00:21:23,069
- We'll find him when we get there.
- Which brings us to problem two.

289
00:21:23,189 --> 00:21:24,200
- Oi!
- Oi!

290
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:37,655
I think I have a... I have a plan.

291
00:21:38,161 --> 00:21:39,423
I'm listening.

292
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:41,760
You... you get arrested,

293
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:45,280
get taken to the dungeon,
find Archer and then...

294
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,465
I'll bribe the guards,

295
00:21:47,585 --> 00:21:49,320
- I'll come and see you.
- And then what?

296
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:51,224
- And then we escape.
- How?

297
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:53,880
Well, I don't know.
I haven't worked that out yet, have I?

298
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:00,556
- Forget it. It'll never work.
- Why not?

299
00:22:00,676 --> 00:22:02,719
- Because I'm not getting arrested.
- Why not?

300
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:06,062
- Cos you'll leave me in the dungeon.
- I will not leave you in the dungeons. 

301
00:22:06,182 --> 00:22:07,709
You have my word.

302
00:22:08,721 --> 00:22:11,171
You see,
that's where this falls down.

303
00:22:11,388 --> 00:22:12,960
{\Well, }All right. I'll get myself arrested{\ then}.

304
00:22:13,121 --> 00:22:16,840
- That sounds like a better plan.
- And you come and get me out.

305
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,096
See? Suddenly it's not
such a good idea, is it?

306
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:22,216
You know,

307
00:22:23,022 --> 00:22:26,680
I'm not sure if I trust you yet.
But we're about to find out.

308
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:31,881
Good luck.

309
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,321
<i>Do you think that's funny?</i>

310
00:22:39,161 --> 00:22:41,520
Right! Get off me! Get off me!

311
00:22:43,401 --> 00:22:44,600
Get off me!

312
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:05,771
- You!
- My leg!

313
00:23:05,891 --> 00:23:07,712
- Get up now!
- My leg's gone.

314
00:23:07,832 --> 00:23:09,516
You'll have to carry me. My leg.

315
00:23:09,636 --> 00:23:11,186
On your feet, I said!

316
00:23:11,487 --> 00:23:12,687
My leg's gone.

317
00:23:13,508 --> 00:23:16,258
- Get up!
- All right, all right, all right!

318
00:23:36,992 --> 00:23:40,142
What are you doing?
I was just gonna finish him off.

319
00:23:40,707 --> 00:23:42,919
Yeah. I saw. What are you doing?

320
00:23:43,386 --> 00:23:46,686
- Risking your life, no weapons?
- I was just saving you.

321
00:23:46,806 --> 00:23:48,006
You're a fool.

322
00:23:48,664 --> 00:23:50,834
Maybe but I had no choice.

323
00:23:52,357 --> 00:23:54,257
Hey, I'm your family, right?

324
00:23:55,774 --> 00:23:57,632
Yeah, you are.

325
00:23:58,025 --> 00:23:59,571
Right. Horses!

326
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,009
No. Isabella.

327
00:24:02,365 --> 00:24:05,965
She's on her way to York.
We need to get the others. Come on.

328
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:10,731
In, you go!

329
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,447
Get off me! Get... get off me!

330
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,560
Get off!

331
00:24:19,398 --> 00:24:21,720
I'll kill the next man
that touches me.

332
00:24:24,306 --> 00:24:25,320
Kill me.

333
00:24:25,866 --> 00:24:26,866
Please.

334
00:24:28,313 --> 00:24:29,888
Put me out of me misery.

335
00:24:30,008 --> 00:24:31,008
No.

336
00:24:32,909 --> 00:24:35,159
You didn't bring any food, did you?

337
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,041
Hey.

338
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,850
Robin's in trouble. Isabella's
on her way to York with her guards.

339
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:48,571
She must know Robin and Gisborne
are there. Why else would she go?

340
00:24:49,241 --> 00:24:51,236
We'll stop her
before she gets to York.

341
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:54,256
We'll have to cut across the forest, try
and get on the York road ahead of her.

342
00:24:54,376 --> 00:24:55,379
Let's go.

343
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,120
He's family.

344
00:25:00,671 --> 00:25:02,520
I'm glad you came back, John.

345
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,760
I'm looking for a man called Archer.
Heard of him?

346
00:25:10,913 --> 00:25:12,440
Might have. Why?

347
00:25:12,681 --> 00:25:14,626
- He's my brother.
- Brother?

348
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:15,746
Yeah.

349
00:25:16,653 --> 00:25:19,080
I've come to help him escape
from this godforsaken place.

350
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:20,240
Escape?

351
00:25:21,075 --> 00:25:22,560
How will you escape?

352
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:26,121
Well, I haven't come alone.
You ever heard of Robin Hood?

353
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:30,040
- Brother.
- You're my brother?

354
00:25:30,281 --> 00:25:31,600
Prison ages a man.

355
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:34,440
- No, you can't be Archer.
- Who says?

356
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:36,478
- I'm Archer.
- I'm Archer.

357
00:25:36,598 --> 00:25:38,051
- I'm Archer.
- I'm Archer.

358
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:40,260
- Great!
- No, I'm Archer.

359
00:25:40,441 --> 00:25:41,888
- I'm Archer.
- I'm Archer.

360
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:43,008
Quiet!

361
00:25:46,181 --> 00:25:47,388
I'm Archer.

362
00:25:51,142 --> 00:25:52,542
Who's your father?

363
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:54,909
I don't know.

364
00:25:56,404 --> 00:25:57,760
And I don't care.

365
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:02,051
- Your mother?
- She died when I was a baby.

366
00:26:02,281 --> 00:26:05,480
- I was given away.
- I was told you have a birthmark.

367
00:26:14,668 --> 00:26:16,968
- You're my brother.
- Who are you?

368
00:26:17,636 --> 00:26:21,392
- Guy of Gisborne.
- That's a very expensive sounding name.

369
00:26:22,277 --> 00:26:23,760
I've come to get you out of here.

370
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,840
How?

371
00:26:30,744 --> 00:26:33,840
<i>Pleasure doing business with you.
Thank you.</i>

372
00:26:53,475 --> 00:26:54,600
Who are you?

373
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:10,480
Well, the truth is Gisborne just...
had a bit too much to drink.

374
00:27:11,174 --> 00:27:14,024
And for that, I am sure
he's profoundly sorry.

375
00:27:14,428 --> 00:27:17,600
An assault on one of the Sheriff's men
is an assault on the Sheriff.

376
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,170
Believe me, I know.

377
00:27:21,825 --> 00:27:23,625
Would this be enough to...

378
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:26,880
salve the indignity
of this terrible assault?

379
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,120
It is but a faint memory now, sir.

380
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,157
I thank you for your... sympathy.

381
00:27:37,386 --> 00:27:39,233
Escort this gentleman to the dungeon

382
00:27:39,353 --> 00:27:42,240
so that he may collect
his malfeasant friend.

383
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:44,269
Thank you very much.

384
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,260
<i>An emissary
from the Sheriff of Nottingham.</i>

385
00:27:58,321 --> 00:28:00,280
Come on! We must hurry.

386
00:28:02,241 --> 00:28:03,241
Come on!

387
00:28:23,007 --> 00:28:24,540
Gisborne! Visitor.

388
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:31,663
- He's over here.
- We have to hurry.

389
00:28:31,783 --> 00:28:33,783
One of Isabella's men is here.

390
00:28:41,746 --> 00:28:42,760
Brother.

391
00:28:43,662 --> 00:28:46,262
All of a sudden,
I have so many brothers.

392
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:50,960
- Who are you?
- I'm Robin Hood.

393
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,880
Really?

394
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,360
Robin Hood really exists?

395
00:28:57,515 --> 00:28:58,915
Just... stay here.

396
00:29:01,915 --> 00:29:05,040
- How much to take him with us?
- How much do you have?

397
00:29:05,406 --> 00:29:06,560
I'd be cheaper.

398
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:15,004
How about that?

399
00:29:16,926 --> 00:29:17,931
Nah.

400
00:29:18,051 --> 00:29:20,600
He's meant to die tomorrow
and I think the Sheriff was, you know,

401
00:29:21,091 --> 00:29:23,800
- looking forward to it.
- Of course he is.

402
00:29:26,737 --> 00:29:29,886
I'll have to leave York.
Missus won't be happy.

403
00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:32,531
Yeah, the missus. All right.

404
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,240
Right.

405
00:29:37,435 --> 00:29:38,720
Nah, {\I'm }sorry. Can't help you.

406
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:43,289
Robin Hood

407
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,950
and Guy of Gisborne...

408
00:29:46,777 --> 00:29:48,880
they're both dangerous criminals.

409
00:29:49,692 --> 00:29:50,692
Gisborne?

410
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,680
Gisborne?

411
00:29:55,382 --> 00:29:56,657
<i>Gisborne.</i>

412
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:58,840
We need to go.

413
00:30:01,323 --> 00:30:02,160
No.

414
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:05,049
Either we all go...

415
00:30:06,483 --> 00:30:08,033
... or none of us go.

416
00:30:09,466 --> 00:30:10,466
Fine.

417
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:16,105
- Do you know where you're going?
- Not really, no. Do you?

418
00:30:16,225 --> 00:30:18,319
- Get back!
<i>- This way!</i>

419
00:30:21,193 --> 00:30:22,200
Come on.

420
00:30:26,973 --> 00:30:27,973
Come on.

421
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,052
Go on without me.

422
00:30:30,172 --> 00:30:33,043
Come on, you old codger.
I'm not leaving you behind.

423
00:30:33,163 --> 00:30:34,200
<i>Down here!</i>

424
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,280
Come on.

425
00:30:44,793 --> 00:30:45,943
- Now?
- No.

426
00:30:46,683 --> 00:30:47,720
Hold it.

427
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,985
- Now?
- Hold it.

428
00:30:55,023 --> 00:30:57,360
- Now?
- Hold it.

429
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:00,400
Now!

430
00:31:09,073 --> 00:31:10,073
Get off!

431
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:30,563
Kate, wait.

432
00:31:30,683 --> 00:31:32,733
- Get off! Get off me!
- Wait!

433
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,720
Come on. Wait.

434
00:31:36,006 --> 00:31:39,241
We must get Gisborne and Robin
from York before she returns.

435
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:40,361
Let's go.

436
00:31:45,238 --> 00:31:46,638
So you're a noble,

437
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,305
who's now an outlaw, with no money?

438
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,760
Yep.

439
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,560
Can you explain the point of that?

440
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,980
Come on!

441
00:32:04,705 --> 00:32:06,960
Where did you learn that?
The Orient?

442
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,320
No.

443
00:32:09,681 --> 00:32:11,181
That's pure English.

444
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,920
- He doesn't, by {\any }chance, have any money{\, does he}?
- No, I don't.

445
00:32:16,857 --> 00:32:19,726
I gave up all my family's wealth
to help the poor.

446
00:32:19,846 --> 00:32:21,096
Course you did.

447
00:32:22,635 --> 00:32:24,156
Pull their bodies in there.

448
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,826
- Come on.
- Come on. Let's keep moving.

449
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:33,868
Both of you are mad. I know
what poor is. I grew up that way.

450
00:32:34,546 --> 00:32:36,196
If either of you had...

451
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,015
There is no honour in being poor
and there's no shame in it.

452
00:32:40,135 --> 00:32:42,438
If you'd grown up with nothing,
you'd know that.

453
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:45,072
And you wouldn't apologise
for wanting to have a little money,

454
00:32:45,192 --> 00:32:46,960
for dreaming of something better...

455
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,510
You know nothing about my life,
about what I've endured!

456
00:32:51,148 --> 00:32:52,198
I envy you.

457
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,680
Better no family, rich or poor,
than a leper father and a mother...

458
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:01,200
My mother what?

459
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:08,800
Killed in a fire.

460
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:14,852
What was her name?

461
00:33:15,459 --> 00:33:16,480
Ghislaine.

462
00:33:20,777 --> 00:33:22,877
Come on. We have to keep moving.

463
00:33:28,594 --> 00:33:30,229
This way.

464
00:33:30,662 --> 00:33:31,880
It's this way.

465
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:34,215
- Don't argue with me.
- Gisborne, it's this way.

466
00:33:34,335 --> 00:33:36,146
Either of you been
in this castle before?

467
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:37,351
- No.
- No.

468
00:33:37,471 --> 00:33:38,280
Great!

469
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,697
This way. Come on. Come on.

470
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:47,720
Stop. Stop. Where's the old man?

471
00:33:48,055 --> 00:33:49,399
- Where is he?
- Don't know.

472
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,280
<i>You! You! Prisoner!</i>

473
00:33:53,872 --> 00:33:54,880
Please!

474
00:33:55,121 --> 00:33:56,621
Please, don't shoot.

475
00:33:59,018 --> 00:33:59,840
No!

476
00:34:02,298 --> 00:34:03,298
Get off!

477
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,599
Get back! Get back!

478
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:36,639
- It's Robin Hood!
- Go! Robin! Through here!

479
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:42,083
Guards!

480
00:34:45,736 --> 00:34:48,239
<i>Stop! Take them alive!</i>

481
00:34:49,481 --> 00:34:53,477
The Sheriff of Nottingham
is offering 100 crowns each

482
00:34:54,223 --> 00:34:56,880
for Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne.

483
00:34:57,041 --> 00:34:59,760
It might be worth more than that
to watch them die.

484
00:35:00,002 --> 00:35:02,400
- I think we've got a good chance.
- We should give ourselves up.

485
00:35:02,864 --> 00:35:05,080
- Give ourselves up?
- Yeah, live to fight another day.

486
00:35:05,717 --> 00:35:08,240
No. That's not how I do business.

487
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,958
Stop! Get off me!

488
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:13,458
The best chance we have
is to work together. Understood?

489
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,000
Don't struggle.

490
00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:18,840
Gentlemen, I offer you Robin Hood
for my freedom.

491
00:35:19,354 --> 00:35:21,240
He is valuable. I am not.

492
00:35:22,129 --> 00:35:23,400
And it'd be a shame for me

493
00:35:23,561 --> 00:35:25,560
to kill him, since he's worth
so much more {\to you }alive.

494
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:26,859
Guards!

495
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,240
Don't shoot!

496
00:35:29,504 --> 00:35:31,240
See? We're making progress.

497
00:35:35,363 --> 00:35:36,763
Allow me, Sheriff,

498
00:35:37,153 --> 00:35:40,016
to give the gift of Robin Hood
and Guy of Gisborne

499
00:35:40,136 --> 00:35:42,080
to the Sheriff of Nottingham
on your behalf.

500
00:35:42,634 --> 00:35:45,484
I see why the Sheriff wants you.
But Gisborne?

501
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,960
The Sheriff is his sister.

502
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,840
His sister?

503
00:35:50,001 --> 00:35:52,401
The Sheriff covets them both,
my lord.

504
00:35:52,521 --> 00:35:54,528
We're supposed
to be working together.

505
00:35:54,648 --> 00:35:56,045
Well, I changed my mind.

506
00:35:56,165 --> 00:35:57,726
Do we have a deal, Sheriff?

507
00:35:57,846 --> 00:36:00,200
I won't kill Robin Hood
and you won't kill me.

508
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:03,039
Yes.

509
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,320
It's a deal.

510
00:36:06,521 --> 00:36:07,969
You're gonna betray me like this?

511
00:36:08,089 --> 00:36:10,394
I have a sister who's the Sheriff
of Nottingham. She's rich,

512
00:36:10,514 --> 00:36:12,543
she's powerful and she hates you.

513
00:36:12,663 --> 00:36:15,720
This really isn't taking me
a lot of thought. Out of the way!

514
00:36:18,355 --> 00:36:19,705
Nice meeting you.

515
00:36:20,521 --> 00:36:22,560
- Seize him!
- Stop!

516
00:36:24,741 --> 00:36:26,560
Prepare them all to die.

517
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:29,695
The Sheriff of Nottingham
can keep her money.

518
00:36:30,281 --> 00:36:33,719
I'll send her their severed heads...
as a gift.

519
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:41,200
I'm certainly glad I came
to rescue my brother, aren't you?

520
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,880
- This is not my fault.
- No? Whose fault is it then?

521
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:45,560
I didn't ask you to come.

522
00:37:09,858 --> 00:37:12,258
Much, John,
take the right-hand side.

523
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:13,873
Allan, left.

524
00:37:17,657 --> 00:37:19,920
The drums aren't generally
thought to be a good thing.

525
00:37:35,939 --> 00:37:38,089
<i>Proceed with the first execution.</i>

526
00:37:54,066 --> 00:37:55,216
Get them off!

527
00:37:55,761 --> 00:37:56,761
This way!

528
00:38:12,364 --> 00:38:13,814
Let's go! Let's go!

529
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:23,052
John!

530
00:38:29,361 --> 00:38:31,107
- All right?
- Yeah.

531
00:38:43,681 --> 00:38:45,614
- Take me with you, please!
- Gweneth.

532
00:38:45,734 --> 00:38:48,120
- I'm begging you!
- You have to stop doing this.

533
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,400
- I want to come.
- You can't.

534
00:38:50,601 --> 00:38:51,601
No!

535
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,200
Leave him alone!

536
00:38:58,723 --> 00:39:01,273
Where is Robin Hood
and Guy of Gisborne?

537
00:39:02,001 --> 00:39:05,240
- Tell me or die.
- I don't know.

538
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:06,800
Then you die.

539
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:08,160
He's behind you.

540
00:39:08,997 --> 00:39:10,840
- You think I'm a fool?
- Yes.

541
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:19,600
This is my brother.
And this is my family.

542
00:39:20,268 --> 00:39:22,960
Look, we need your help. We know
you have weapons and we need them.

543
00:39:23,121 --> 00:39:25,840
My weapons are for sale.
Do you have money?

544
00:39:26,673 --> 00:39:29,265
We just risked our lives for you,
and you betrayed us.

545
00:39:29,385 --> 00:39:30,400
You owe us.

546
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,680
Archer, I want you to join us.

547
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:36,960
I want you to join us in our fight
against Prince John.

548
00:39:37,737 --> 00:39:40,679
I'm flattered.
But I have my own plans.

549
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,302
And they don't include anyone else.

550
00:39:44,422 --> 00:39:46,879
Archer, please, take me with you.

551
00:39:49,707 --> 00:39:53,280
Gweneth... Thank you
for everything you've done for me.

552
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,840
I don't deserve a woman like you.

553
00:40:02,305 --> 00:40:03,480
He stole my horse.

554
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:11,049
He was killed by Robin Hood's arrow.

555
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:14,000
Both Hood and Gisborne escaped.

556
00:40:15,057 --> 00:40:18,313
I would thank you to keep
a tighter rein on your affairs...

557
00:40:18,433 --> 00:40:19,439
Sheriff!

558
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,310
Gisborne killed your brother.

559
00:40:36,023 --> 00:40:37,360
He killed Marian.

560
00:40:37,874 --> 00:40:38,874
Kate,

561
00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:43,000
I know how much it hurts
to lose someone you love.

562
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,070
But revenge...

563
00:40:47,649 --> 00:40:49,120
it burns your soul.

564
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,090
It can destroy you.

565
00:40:52,346 --> 00:40:54,559
But we have to look forward.

566
00:40:58,127 --> 00:41:00,040
I need you to accept him.

567
00:41:01,768 --> 00:41:05,022
We both need to accept him.

568
00:41:07,858 --> 00:41:09,159
I'll accept him.

569
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:15,559
But I can never trust him.

570
00:41:19,446 --> 00:41:21,999
So, where do you want me
to sleep, then?

571
00:41:34,573 --> 00:41:36,623
Is this the road to Nottingham?

572
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:57,480
<i>We take the castle and we hold it,
till King Richard returns.</i>

573
00:41:57,641 --> 00:41:59,240
If we join forces, think about it.

574
00:41:59,401 --> 00:42:02,360
<i>Your power, my skill...
we can be unstoppable.</i>

575
00:42:02,726 --> 00:42:06,200
<i>- We can't take a castle.
- We can if we go down the tunnel.</i>

576
00:42:06,361 --> 00:42:08,840
For a few pennies,
I can trap the tunnel.

577
00:42:09,075 --> 00:42:10,080
No!

578
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:12,840
This is how we die,
buried in limestone.

579
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:15,760
<i>The plan is in place.</i>

580
00:42:15,961 --> 00:42:16,966
Close the gate.

581
00:42:17,086 --> 00:42:18,360
Men, at my command!

582
00:42:18,616 --> 00:42:20,120
Hell is coming.
