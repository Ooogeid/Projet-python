1
00:00:19,824 --> 00:00:21,574
What progress, Deschamps?

2
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,500
The Prince is not a patient man.

3
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,120
Uncanny...

4
00:00:35,818 --> 00:00:37,790
Not so close with the candle.

5
00:00:39,395 --> 00:00:41,510
You are indeed an artist.

6
00:00:46,855 --> 00:00:48,105
It is finished.

7
00:00:49,638 --> 00:00:52,045
As skilful with a scalpel and brush,

8
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:54,329
as I am with a dagger.

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,280
You shall feel no pain, my friend.

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,370
You give your life
for a place in history.

11
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:11,218
- Allan!
- What?

12
00:01:13,463 --> 00:01:14,463
Good.

13
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:19,516
Much! Come on!

14
00:01:19,636 --> 00:01:21,800
You don't go easy
just because it's training!

15
00:01:22,107 --> 00:01:23,920
I'm trying not to hurt you.

16
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:26,440
You won't hurt him
if you never hit him, will you?

17
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, come on, boys!

18
00:01:35,841 --> 00:01:37,360
- Blinding!
- Robin!

19
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,880
Are you all right?

20
00:01:39,192 --> 00:01:41,238
There's a Royal carriage
on the North Road.

21
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:43,418
Carrying the King's insignia,
not the Prince's.

22
00:01:43,538 --> 00:01:45,560
- Let's go.
- It's heading for Nottingham.

23
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:48,213
- Come on. Up!
- Get him up.

24
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,274
Come on. Come on!

25
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:57,841
It's Sheridan.

26
00:01:58,108 --> 00:02:00,040
- Who?
- Keeper of the Crown.

27
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:05,951
He used to be the King's
favourite trainer of Knights.

28
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:07,779
He trained me.

29
00:02:13,988 --> 00:02:14,988
No!

30
00:02:15,993 --> 00:02:18,440
No, no, no!

31
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:25,191
People of Nottingham!

32
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,337
It is to your great sadness,

33
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:31,407
but also to your great honour,

34
00:02:33,047 --> 00:02:35,197
that you are the first to know...

35
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,080
of the death of King Richard.

36
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:45,975
The Lionheart met his glorious end

37
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:49,110
in battle with the Infidel.

38
00:03:02,537 --> 00:03:04,637
I thank you for your sympathy...

39
00:03:06,184 --> 00:03:07,600
and for your love.

40
00:03:09,324 --> 00:03:11,511
The Archbishop of Canterbury
is on his way

41
00:03:11,631 --> 00:03:14,193
to bless my brother's body.

42
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:18,440
And though these are not
the circumstances I would've wished for,

43
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:22,120
in the interests of stability
and national security...

44
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:25,846
... he will also
oversee my coronation.

45
00:03:28,795 --> 00:03:30,145
The King is dead.

46
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:32,984
Long live the King!

47
00:03:34,929 --> 00:03:36,360
Long live the King!

48
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,142
- Long live the King!
- Kneel.

49
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:42,518
Get down, get down!

50
00:03:44,394 --> 00:03:45,749
Long live me.

51
00:03:50,507 --> 00:03:54,560

00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,360
Episode eight
THE KING IS DEAD, LONG LIVE THE KING...

54
00:04:29,748 --> 00:04:32,758
If this is God's will, then I have
to question His judgement.

55
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:35,731
- He was a great King, and a good man.
- Don't, Much.

56
00:04:35,851 --> 00:04:37,853
- I'm sorry, Robin.
- He's not dead!

57
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:39,819
- He can't be!
- Robin, the guards...

58
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:42,280
John, I'd know if he was dead.
I'd feel it.

59
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:45,760
- I know.
- This Sheridan, is he a man you trust?

60
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:48,640
He used to be
one of the King's best.

61
00:04:48,801 --> 00:04:50,960
But now, obviously,
he's gone with Prince John.

62
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:54,621
- We all share your grief, Robin.
- I need to see his face.

63
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,320
I need to know for sure.

64
00:05:05,063 --> 00:05:07,994
His body is in remarkable condition
for a month at sea.

65
00:05:08,114 --> 00:05:10,720
The Moors.
They're masters of embalming.

66
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:21,440
<i>Requiescat in pace.</i>

67
00:05:22,802 --> 00:05:25,297
Thank you. He's close to God now.

68
00:05:29,071 --> 00:05:31,320
Why did I not hear of this sooner?

69
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:33,951
The advanced messenger
came to me in London

70
00:05:34,071 --> 00:05:37,056
only a day before the body
was due to arrive.

71
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:41,040
I swore the man to secrecy
before meeting it at Hull

72
00:05:41,281 --> 00:05:44,395
in the dead of night and...
coming to the Prince forthwith.

73
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:46,158
And rightly so, I believe.

74
00:05:46,278 --> 00:05:48,734
There are those who would take advantage
of an interregnum

75
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:51,760
- to further their own ends.
- I shall consult with the Royal Council.

76
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:54,560
I am the rightful heir, am I not?

77
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:00,800
Indeed.

78
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:05,348
But first...

79
00:06:05,795 --> 00:06:08,745
there will need to be
a state funeral in London.

80
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,346
And there shall be one.
I shall see to it myself.

81
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:14,416
London was my brother's
seat of power after all.

82
00:06:15,504 --> 00:06:16,504
But...

83
00:06:16,927 --> 00:06:20,820
power, as you know, is finely balanced
between north and south.

84
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:22,960
And now that the tragic news is out,

85
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,560
any delay could cause
that balance to shift.

86
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:29,192
Which is why I propose
making my seat, Nottingham,

87
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:31,162
the new capital of England.

88
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:35,165
As the claim is uncontested,

89
00:06:35,285 --> 00:06:38,480
I saw no barrier
in bringing the Crown with me.

90
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:41,000
Everything is in place.

91
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:46,942
So be it.

92
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,970
We'll move his body to the crypt.

93
00:07:16,112 --> 00:07:17,112
Allan.

94
00:07:21,116 --> 00:07:22,116
Good luck.

95
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:40,673
There's bodies down here.

96
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,360
That's the idea, Much. Come on.

97
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:53,738
You can hold my hand
if you get scared.

98
00:07:53,858 --> 00:07:54,858
Thanks.

99
00:07:56,635 --> 00:07:57,958
Much, get off me!

100
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,240
Come on, help me get it off.

101
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
It's him.

102
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:31,565
It's true.

103
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:34,855
- Kate, be careful.
- Wait.

104
00:08:44,814 --> 00:08:45,814
God.

105
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:50,007
It's wax!

106
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:52,920
What?!

107
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:56,200
It's a waxwork made
to look like King Richard.

108
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,320
<i>I knew it!</i>

109
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:04,760
I knew he was still alive!

110
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,530
Wherever you stick the pin,
the city is yours!

111
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:23,400
Swindon! Rather you than me!

112
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:25,640
Come on, who's next?!

113
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,760
London is still up for grabs,
but Nottingham is out of bounds.

114
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,160
Don't want our new capital
in the hands of drunkards, do we?

115
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,480
So tell me, where would a King
desire to put his pin?

116
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,150
In a flatterer's eye.

117
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:43,491
I actually wanted to give you my
personal congratulations, your highness.

118
00:09:43,611 --> 00:09:44,888
I'm sure you do.

119
00:09:45,008 --> 00:09:48,142
And of course my condolences
for your late brother.

120
00:09:48,503 --> 00:09:51,880
And in the light of your increasing
national responsibilities,

121
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,912
I imagine you will need the loyal

122
00:09:55,032 --> 00:09:57,440
and varied services

123
00:09:58,112 --> 00:10:00,959
that only I could offer you
as a potential Sheriff.

124
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:03,600
The same sort of services
as you offered Robin Hood?

125
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:07,680
- No.
- Or your brother offered me?

126
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,250
Robin and Guy mean nothing to me.

127
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:13,160
Given the opportunity,
I would love to prove that to you.

128
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,600
Why don't you prove it anyway.

129
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,120
And maybe I'll consider you along
with the other candidates for Sheriff.

130
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,030
What other candidates?

131
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:22,680
Sheridan!

132
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:26,255
My rock in these troubled times.

133
00:10:27,014 --> 00:10:30,800
- You do love me, don't you?
- With all my heart, Sire.

134
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:33,601
Perhaps we should use
this distraction

135
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:35,922
to finish our night's business
at the abbey

136
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:38,400
while the Archbishop sleeps here?

137
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:44,080
Have you met the Lady Isabella,
Guy of Gisborne's sister?

138
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,023
Enchanted.

139
00:10:49,843 --> 00:10:52,040
- I'm sure.
- Beware, Sheridan,

140
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,360
she shares blood with an outlaw.

141
00:11:10,577 --> 00:11:11,827
Where do we hide?

142
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:13,997
Get the lid on, get the lid on!

143
00:11:19,323 --> 00:11:20,520
This way. Come on!

144
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:33,440
Set the bonfire in the clearing
over there.

145
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:35,701
It's time to play dead, come on.

146
00:11:36,705 --> 00:11:38,009
Get this lid off.

147
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:41,160
Come on, please. Do we have to?

148
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,840
Unless you want to be put in one
yourself, I say yes. Now get it open!

149
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:46,483
<i>Richard!</i>

150
00:11:47,948 --> 00:11:51,120
There's no time, you're going
to have to get in with me.

151
00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:53,779
<i>Oh, Richard.</i>

152
00:11:55,394 --> 00:11:57,618
Dicky, Dicky, Dicky!

153
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:01,256
We've come back for you!

154
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:05,731
Brother! There you are.

155
00:12:09,534 --> 00:12:12,784
You know, I think I prefer this one
to the real thing.

156
00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:17,439
At least this one doesn't lie
and double deal

157
00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:22,760
and steal his brother's place
on his father's throne.

158
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,240
Or in his mother's heart.

159
00:12:28,441 --> 00:12:30,960
I've been in your shadow
too long, brother.

160
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,529
It's my turn to step
into the light...

161
00:12:35,112 --> 00:12:37,400
while you will burn
in the pits of hell!

162
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:44,826
Kate, that's the only evidence!

163
00:12:45,148 --> 00:12:46,800
It's too dangerous.

164
00:12:52,886 --> 00:12:54,136
It's all right,

165
00:12:54,878 --> 00:12:57,178
we have no further use for the body.

166
00:12:57,574 --> 00:13:00,080
The Archbishop has seen enough
of my brother's beauty

167
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,080
to proclaim it to the world,
no doubt.

168
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:04,640
Then we should proceed
with the plan forthwith.

169
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:08,120
You're not having second thoughts,
are you, Sheridan?

170
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:10,600
- Certainly not.
- You seem nervous.

171
00:13:13,537 --> 00:13:15,899
Guards! Take the coffin.

172
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:20,911
If anybody asks where the body is,

173
00:13:21,141 --> 00:13:24,680
it's gone to London for a state funeral
at the Archbishop's request.

174
00:13:25,891 --> 00:13:29,080
By the time anybody finds out
that there is no body...

175
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:31,661
... it'll be too late.

176
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:38,752
What does Sheridan know
about Nottingham anyway?

177
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:41,101
Stupid old fool.

178
00:13:42,024 --> 00:13:43,224
Hello, sister.

179
00:13:48,681 --> 00:13:50,280
Guy, please, please, just wait.

180
00:13:50,618 --> 00:13:52,547
For you to betray me again?!

181
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:54,499
You got what you deserved.

182
00:13:57,722 --> 00:13:59,932
You'll get what you deserve.

183
00:14:01,723 --> 00:14:02,943
So kill me.

184
00:14:04,521 --> 00:14:06,640
You did as much to me
when I was a child anyway.

185
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:09,484
Is that to be your dying thought?

186
00:14:09,743 --> 00:14:10,820
Yes.

187
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:13,311
Go on, end it now

188
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:17,122
and put us both out of our misery.

189
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:20,080
Come on!

190
00:14:25,384 --> 00:14:26,720
What's wrong with you?

191
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:30,880
Well, maybe we change things.

192
00:14:33,636 --> 00:14:35,200
King Richard is dead.

193
00:14:35,896 --> 00:14:37,760
Prince John is due to be crowned.

194
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,840
- What?
- That's right, I can help you.

195
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,448
- How can you help me?
- I can speak for you,

196
00:14:45,727 --> 00:14:47,400
but for that, you need me alive.

197
00:14:48,557 --> 00:14:49,799
<i>Kill me...</i>

198
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,760
and you kill your last chance
back with the new King.

199
00:14:53,382 --> 00:14:54,582
Let me live...

200
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,320
and we can both get what we want.

201
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,720
We have to stop them
destroying that thing.

202
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,320
How? There could be loads of them.

203
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:16,160
We need a cloak.

204
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:28,297
Good.

205
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:29,999
Good.

206
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,094
Make sure you destroy everything.

207
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:34,214
Yes, sir.

208
00:15:39,251 --> 00:15:41,800
- At least we'll be warm.
- Yeah!

209
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,360
Yeah, I've had worse jobs.

210
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,960
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

211
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,840
Quick, run!

212
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,280
- Tuck.
- Yeah, yeah.

213
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
Ready?

214
00:16:09,884 --> 00:16:11,640
One, two, three.

215
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,120
- We're too late!
- We can still tell the Archbishop,

216
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:25,811
- tell him the truth.
- He already thinks he's seen the body.

217
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:27,320
It's our word against theirs.

218
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,512
We can't let the Prince
take power like this!

219
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:32,120
We must stop him,
assassinate him if we have to.

220
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,224
If we assassinate him, Tuck,
we risk invasion, civil war even!

221
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:39,480
- But this is treason!
- I know,

222
00:16:40,005 --> 00:16:42,467
and I hate him as much as you do.
But while Richard's away,

223
00:16:42,587 --> 00:16:44,133
Prince John is our only leader.

224
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,713
That's fine when he's Prince,
but when he's King he can make new laws,

225
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,241
say and do what he wants,
spend what he wants.

226
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:52,154
Then we stop him becoming King,
don't we?

227
00:16:52,274 --> 00:16:53,080
How?

228
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:59,280
Well, for a coronation to take place,
you need a crown.

229
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,129
Am I right?

230
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
Well, then we steal his crown.

231
00:17:06,312 --> 00:17:10,012
How did you control yourself,
looking over it every single day?

232
00:17:10,907 --> 00:17:13,470
I am but a soldier, not a King.

233
00:17:14,395 --> 00:17:16,895
But with your help,
I will be one soon.

234
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:21,120
Quick, quick, lock it away.
I don't trust myself.

235
00:17:21,968 --> 00:17:24,368
I shall wait
until the time is right.

236
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:29,901
When all the world will see me shine
in the role to which I am destined.

237
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,040
- How did you sleep?
- With one eye open.

238
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:48,129
If we are going to work together,
we must learn to lower our guard.

239
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:50,920
Looks painful.

240
00:17:51,454 --> 00:17:53,400
It's a scratch, I'll be fine.

241
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:54,871
Here.

242
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
So...

243
00:18:04,175 --> 00:18:07,275
how am I to get back
into the new King's favour?

244
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:10,000
I have decided to speak
to him for you.

245
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,360
On one condition.

246
00:18:14,117 --> 00:18:15,560
I need you to apologise.

247
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,510
Apologise?

248
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:20,992
- What for?
- You know what for.

249
00:18:21,112 --> 00:18:23,860
Isabella. Had I not
arranged your marriage

250
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,257
we'd still live in some
God-forsaken corner of France

251
00:18:26,377 --> 00:18:29,360
- without a penny or acre to our name.
- Better that, than have been with him.

252
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,520
NO! It is not my fault that you failed
to make the best of your chance.

253
00:18:34,566 --> 00:18:37,520
In fact it's down to me that we're still
in with a chance of anything.

254
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:39,330
So instead of wasting time,

255
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,450
I say we work out exactly what it is
you're going to say to the Prince.

256
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,110
I was thinking...

257
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:50,160
maybe I should just drug you
and hand you in to him myself.

258
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:51,280
What?

259
00:18:51,975 --> 00:18:54,425
I was willing to forgive you,
brother,

260
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:57,231
but you don't deserve my absolution.

261
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:02,479
Oh, no, no. It's not your drink.

262
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,000
It's your wound.

263
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:09,771
Straight into your bloodstream.

264
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,814
Concentrated valerian root.

265
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,680
Enough to knock out a horse.

266
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,380
I doubt Lord Sheridan
would've thought of that one.

267
00:19:29,921 --> 00:19:33,521
- Private room, sir?
- Another round for my drinking friends.

268
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:38,703
Hello, Master.

269
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:45,600
Robin of Locksley...

270
00:19:47,965 --> 00:19:50,240
I apologise for our surroundings,

271
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:52,840
but I'm not really a favourite
with the guards.

272
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:54,151
So it's true?

273
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,880
I heard tell
of your feral existence.

274
00:20:00,342 --> 00:20:04,280
I thought it only right to raise
a toast... to our late King.

275
00:20:06,126 --> 00:20:10,113
I know you would've been as...
distraught as I was with the news.

276
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,566
Indeed.

277
00:20:12,231 --> 00:20:14,795
But we must look to the future.

278
00:20:19,357 --> 00:20:21,760
You're not going to cause
me any problems, are you?

279
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:23,320
What do you mean?

280
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:27,231
I also hear that you've been
making trouble for the Prince.

281
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,629
And as the new Sheriff of Nottingham

282
00:20:32,427 --> 00:20:34,377
I can't allow that to happen.

283
00:20:34,497 --> 00:20:37,480
So, you are to be
the new Sheriff, are you?

284
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:41,560
And a very strict one at that!

285
00:20:45,881 --> 00:20:47,431
All work and no play?

286
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:51,680
That doesn't sound like Lord Sheridan,
the great Keeper of the Crown to me.

287
00:20:52,188 --> 00:20:55,659
The Crown is surrounded by outlaws,

288
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,321
where outlaws fear to tread.

289
00:21:01,631 --> 00:21:04,158
Well, if you're happy
with the Prince then...

290
00:21:04,278 --> 00:21:06,440
what problems can I possibly have?

291
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,800
To King John.

292
00:21:11,027 --> 00:21:14,800
So, is this a private party,
or can anyone join in?

293
00:21:14,961 --> 00:21:16,440
I told you to wait outside!

294
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:18,164
We're talking in here!

295
00:21:18,284 --> 00:21:21,534
- I'm sorry about this, I apologise.
- No, no, please,

296
00:21:21,924 --> 00:21:23,800
please... Service!

297
00:21:24,394 --> 00:21:25,400
Sir?

298
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,860
Mead.

299
00:21:27,154 --> 00:21:30,159
You will make me tipsy.

300
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:31,879
Kate, this is private.

301
00:21:33,582 --> 00:21:35,680
I told you to wait outside.

302
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:39,569
You're wet, Locksley.

303
00:21:40,314 --> 00:21:42,960
I'll go and clear this up.
I'll be back.

304
00:21:43,362 --> 00:21:44,719
Well, delicious.

305
00:21:44,881 --> 00:21:46,600
Why, thank you.

306
00:21:48,795 --> 00:21:50,195
I could eat you...

307
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:53,600
Roses, mate, for the coronation.

308
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,831
Thanks very much.

309
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,800
Now, I want the theme
of my coronation to be

310
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,720
"out of the darkness
into the light."

311
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,080
And I want all the guards
with mirrored shields,

312
00:22:21,281 --> 00:22:24,160
to reflect the glory of my leadership
far and wide.

313
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:28,084
I wonder if this opulence is appropriate
while people starve?

314
00:22:28,204 --> 00:22:30,920
Well, I'm giving them
something to aspire to, Archbishop.

315
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,249
All right, very well.
I'll compromise,

316
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:36,772
I'll use rubies instead of diamonds.

317
00:22:43,342 --> 00:22:46,229
Good to see he's got his finger
on the big political issues of the day.

318
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:49,520
If you were Sheridan,
where would you hide the crown?

319
00:22:49,998 --> 00:22:52,400
- Well, you know him better than I do.
- Apparently not.

320
00:22:52,561 --> 00:22:55,910
- Come on, Robin. Trust yourself.
- What did he say?

321
00:22:57,884 --> 00:22:59,661
"Surrounded by outlaws

322
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,991
"where outlaws fear to tread".

323
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:05,680
It's the dungeons!

324
00:23:08,961 --> 00:23:09,966
Here.

325
00:23:20,005 --> 00:23:21,200
Pick up his keys.

326
00:23:40,716 --> 00:23:41,725
Hang on.

327
00:23:44,226 --> 00:23:45,240
Sorry, mate.

328
00:23:49,021 --> 00:23:50,306
- Ready?
- Yeah.

329
00:23:55,087 --> 00:23:58,427
This is gonna take us a bit longer
than we thought, isn't it?

330
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
Another!

331
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,240
No, I must go and help
with the preparation for the coronation.

332
00:24:04,441 --> 00:24:06,395
- No!
- Where's Robin?

333
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:08,429
I'll only let you go

334
00:24:08,755 --> 00:24:11,840
if you beat me at arm wrestling.

335
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:17,040
Oh, come on, look at those muscles.

336
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:21,080
Don't you think
you could beat someone my size?

337
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,896
Well, if you insist.

338
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:35,760
Hey! Hey! Get off her!

339
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,799
- Unhand me!
- Allan?!

340
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,080
A plan's a plan, Kate,
it's gone too far.

341
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,921
Plan? What plan?

342
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,520
My keys! Locksley!

343
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:48,601
Let's go!

344
00:26:02,095 --> 00:26:03,670
Robin! Come on, hurry!

345
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:16,400
- Careful!
- Thanks!

346
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,211
Hallelujah!

347
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:03,920
The crown! Stop him!

348
00:27:17,117 --> 00:27:18,125
Hood!

349
00:27:19,383 --> 00:27:22,104
There can be no coronation
without the crown.

350
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,760
I'm sure another can be made
if needs be. I know the design by heart.

351
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,840
That crown was made for the coronation
of Edward the Confessor.

352
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,440
It cannot be replaced.

353
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:34,526
Sheridan!

354
00:27:34,646 --> 00:27:37,680
Locksley was a former student of mine,
I can get it back.

355
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:40,219
What are you waiting for,
you stupid old fool?

356
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:43,080
Get me back my crown before
the coronation or I'll have your head!

357
00:27:44,744 --> 00:27:46,656
Sire, I have some
very good news for you.

358
00:27:46,776 --> 00:27:48,360
Someone better had.

359
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,694
- I never did get what you saw in her.
- No.

360
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:02,292
Right, chaps...
you can let yourselves out.

361
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,286
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

362
00:28:06,327 --> 00:28:08,840
- Kate...
- If Robin gets caught, it's your fault.

363
00:28:09,136 --> 00:28:11,960
- I thought you were in danger.
- I had everything under control!

364
00:28:12,121 --> 00:28:13,440
They're here!

365
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:18,440
- Well?
- We got the crown.

366
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:23,022
But... they followed us with dogs.

367
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:26,830
I have to get a horse
from Nettlestone

368
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,897
- and get this crown to London.
- London?!

369
00:28:29,017 --> 00:28:32,317
The King may still have
supporters there. I'll be back.

370
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:35,266
- We'll take care of the guards.
- Good luck.

371
00:28:38,475 --> 00:28:40,800
I coated the crown
with a special scent.

372
00:28:42,043 --> 00:28:43,064
Sheridan!

373
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,587
- More mead, sir?
- Follow the bag!

374
00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:50,200
- Which one?
- Both.

375
00:28:50,724 --> 00:28:53,138
- Is this what you're looking for?
- There's another one.

376
00:28:53,258 --> 00:28:54,525
Oi! Old man!

377
00:28:55,721 --> 00:28:56,880
Arrest them all!

378
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:30,120
The crown! The crown!

379
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:44,778
- Vermin!
- Where's the crown?

380
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,452
What crown?

381
00:29:47,754 --> 00:29:50,086
- Get your hands off me!
- Sheridan?

382
00:29:52,053 --> 00:29:54,867
- Give me the crown or the wench'll die.
- Wench?!

383
00:29:58,681 --> 00:29:59,840
Oh, dogs! Er...

384
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:01,776
- Keep moving!
- No!

385
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:03,928
It's here!

386
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:08,200
Wait! The dogs...

387
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,280
- Run for it!
- Grab a dock leaf!

388
00:30:13,761 --> 00:30:15,600
Leave them, we need Hood!

389
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:21,209
Let the dogs go,
they're picking up the scent.

390
00:30:23,536 --> 00:30:27,507
I wanted to give you
a personal coronation gift from me.

391
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,426
So you bring me to your bed chamber?

392
00:30:30,576 --> 00:30:32,279
I give you my brother,

393
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,206
Guy of Gisborne!

394
00:30:37,884 --> 00:30:39,200
- Guy!
- Get back!

395
00:30:39,361 --> 00:30:40,361
Guards!

396
00:30:41,321 --> 00:30:44,480
Get in the corner!
Look what you've done to me, Isabella.

397
00:30:45,155 --> 00:30:47,008
You betrayed me, both of you!

398
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,080
- Are you all right?
- Guards, arrest her!

399
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,520
If I'm disfigured
for my coronation...

400
00:30:55,986 --> 00:30:56,995
Sire!

401
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:08,209
Idiots.

402
00:31:21,517 --> 00:31:24,040
- You taught them well.
- Better than you.

403
00:31:29,001 --> 00:31:31,800
You taught me to love the King.
Not lie about him.

404
00:31:32,674 --> 00:31:34,800
I gave the King
the best years of my life.

405
00:31:35,146 --> 00:31:37,440
And d'you know
what he gave me in return?

406
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,800
Retirement!
Too old to train his knights

407
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:48,818
and good for nothing
but looking after his jewellery!

408
00:31:52,184 --> 00:31:55,086
He entrusted you with the crown
because he loved you!

409
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:57,727
Then why didn't he keep me
by his side?!

410
00:32:05,454 --> 00:32:07,471
Is that the blow of an old man?

411
00:32:11,974 --> 00:32:13,865
So that's what this is about, is it?

412
00:32:13,985 --> 00:32:17,640
You gave up on your country
for your vanity, for your ego?

413
00:32:17,942 --> 00:32:21,000
If the King cared about the country
he'd be here... but he isn't!

414
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:27,360
Your time is past, old master.

415
00:32:28,345 --> 00:32:29,760
It still is my time.

416
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:35,620
Leave him,

417
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,200
he's mine.

418
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,960
Just like the crown.

419
00:32:41,531 --> 00:32:44,719
Out of respect for a good student,

420
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:47,680
I will not kill you.
But you shall never see England again.

421
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,000
Take him to Hull
and put him on a boat.

422
00:32:51,435 --> 00:32:52,443
One way.

423
00:32:53,081 --> 00:32:54,514
Farewell, Locksley.

424
00:32:57,675 --> 00:33:00,799
Send extra search parties
to the forest around Locksley.

425
00:33:00,961 --> 00:33:02,533
I want Gisborne dead!

426
00:33:02,653 --> 00:33:05,367
Sire, I want the same as you,
please.

427
00:33:05,487 --> 00:33:08,342
- Just give me another chance.
- Too late, you've had your chances.

428
00:33:08,462 --> 00:33:10,040
Welcome to your new home!

429
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,834
Sire, please.
Anyone can make a mistake.

430
00:33:13,587 --> 00:33:15,566
Look at Lord Sheridan for example.

431
00:33:16,145 --> 00:33:17,600
Oh, Sheridan...

432
00:33:18,918 --> 00:33:22,523
Sheridan, how could I have ever
doubted your recovery?

433
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,441
Your highness.

434
00:33:26,158 --> 00:33:28,240
- Lady Isabella.
- Pay her no heed.

435
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,981
She's a prisoner of state
for aiding and abetting

436
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:33,925
her terrorist brother Gisborne
in the attempted assassination

437
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,295
of the new King of England.

438
00:33:37,438 --> 00:33:38,912
A serious crime.

439
00:33:39,536 --> 00:33:43,406
For which she will be punished
as seriously as you shall be rewarded.

440
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,354
Perhaps she merely requires
the firm hand of a man

441
00:33:47,474 --> 00:33:50,208
to encourage her to mend her ways.

442
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:54,042
But where would I find such a man
willing to martyr himself?

443
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:57,800
- Always at your service, your highness.
- She's all yours.

444
00:33:58,894 --> 00:34:01,120
- Please, sire.
- Or she'll rot alone down here.

445
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:10,878
And I took the liberty
of dealing with Robin Hood.

446
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:12,755
I hope you don't mind.

447
00:34:13,648 --> 00:34:16,320
You'll make a fine
Sheriff of Nottingham, Sheridan.

448
00:34:20,401 --> 00:34:23,791
The stable boy says
the horses are all accounted for.

449
00:34:24,978 --> 00:34:27,800
- Robin couldn't have made it.
- You should've kept moving, Much.

450
00:34:27,961 --> 00:34:30,991
- He had a knife in your side!
- She can take care of herself.

451
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:34,100
Oh, right, so that's why
you stepped in in the tavern?

452
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,716
- Right.
- I did cos I was worried about her.

453
00:34:36,836 --> 00:34:38,880
- You did cos you were showing off.
- What?!

454
00:34:39,569 --> 00:34:41,330
I did what I did because I care!

455
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,546
- I care!
- You care about yourself.

456
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:45,754
- Is that right?
- Yes!

457
00:34:46,527 --> 00:34:50,359
Robin could be dead and you're
squabbling like a couple of schoolboys!

458
00:34:50,934 --> 00:34:53,460
- Put them out of their misery.
- He's right.

459
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,920
I'm sick of you two
trying to protect me.

460
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:01,040
We've got to keep our minds
on the mission.

461
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:04,240
Right. If Robin didn't make it,
then Sheridan has the crown.

462
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:07,360
If Sheridan has the crown,
Prince John can have his coronation.

463
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:10,040
- We can't let that happen.
- What about Robin?

464
00:35:17,606 --> 00:35:18,627
Shut up!

465
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,089
Stop!

466
00:36:01,979 --> 00:36:05,080
Wakey wakey, Archbishop,
no rest for the wicked!

467
00:36:05,281 --> 00:36:08,040
You've got a coronation to attend!
Mine!

468
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,892
All mine.
And no-one to stop me.

469
00:36:16,434 --> 00:36:20,190
These are the Abbey doors.
We need to go in here, here and here.

470
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,779
And storm the altar.
First one to the crown makes it out,

471
00:36:23,899 --> 00:36:26,337
the rest of us
deal with the consequences.

472
00:36:26,457 --> 00:36:27,840
He might have the crown,

473
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,737
but he's not King until that crown
makes it onto his head.

474
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:34,320
Good. But doesn't "storm" imply
that there's more than five of us?

475
00:36:35,072 --> 00:36:36,484
How about six?

476
00:36:36,964 --> 00:36:38,186
- Hey!
- Robin!

477
00:36:41,747 --> 00:36:44,154
Please tell us you've got
a better plan than this one.

478
00:36:44,274 --> 00:36:45,760
I have, actually.

479
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,080
We're going to need shields.

480
00:36:48,836 --> 00:36:51,400
Just like the ones
Prince John wanted for his guards.

481
00:36:52,496 --> 00:36:54,450
It's going to be blinding, Allan.

482
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,720
Do you love me?

483
00:37:08,428 --> 00:37:09,440
Smile...

484
00:37:09,858 --> 00:37:13,148
I said... do you love me?

485
00:37:59,927 --> 00:38:03,841
As kings, priests and prophets
were anointed,

486
00:38:04,332 --> 00:38:06,160
and as Solomon was anointed king

487
00:38:07,262 --> 00:38:08,795
by Zadok the priest,

488
00:38:09,232 --> 00:38:10,291
so be thou

489
00:38:11,629 --> 00:38:12,650
anointed.

490
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:15,132
The sovereign sceptre

491
00:38:15,481 --> 00:38:16,755
to do justice,

492
00:38:17,419 --> 00:38:20,029
and stop the growth of iniquity.

493
00:38:22,602 --> 00:38:24,492
The robe of righteousness

494
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:27,360
and the garment of salvation,

495
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,147
the crown of the faithful.

496
00:38:32,355 --> 00:38:35,079
Bless, we beseech Thee, this crown,

497
00:38:35,572 --> 00:38:38,773
and so sanctify Thy servant, John.

498
00:38:43,281 --> 00:38:44,281
<i>Halt!</i>

499
00:38:45,968 --> 00:38:48,000
<i>I am King Richard!</i>

500
00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:52,320
<i>King of the English,
Duke of the Normans and Aquitanians.</i>

501
00:38:52,908 --> 00:38:56,120
- You should be in the Holy Land!
<i>- The waxwork lives.</i>

502
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:01,729
What is the meaning of this?

503
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:04,520
It was the Prince's doing,
Your Worship.

504
00:39:04,721 --> 00:39:06,448
He ordered a model made of the King,

505
00:39:06,568 --> 00:39:09,200
- so he could lie about his death.
- I'm sorry, sire.

506
00:39:09,361 --> 00:39:11,120
Shut up, you stupid old fool.

507
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:15,120
- We will finish this coronation!
- Impossible, this is treason!

508
00:39:15,321 --> 00:39:16,800
I will be King!

509
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,840
Hood?!

510
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:29,640
You impersonate the King?!

511
00:39:30,018 --> 00:39:31,440
Just like you,

512
00:39:31,771 --> 00:39:32,960
Prince John.

513
00:39:33,161 --> 00:39:36,400
- Arrest him!
- You can do what you want.

514
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:39,375
These people... they know the truth.

515
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:43,205
And so do I.
I will never make you King.

516
00:39:44,608 --> 00:39:45,880
Where's my crown?

517
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:49,000
Is this what you're looking for?

518
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,731
How about... a state funeral?

519
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:57,915
Gisborne,

520
00:39:58,913 --> 00:40:00,160
don't do it.

521
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:05,560
I know he deserves it,
but with no leader at home,

522
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:09,440
England could be ripped apart,
torn up by war...

523
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:12,771
- What has England ever done for me?
- Brother...

524
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:15,692
Don't think I won't shoot you, as well,
after everything you've done.

525
00:40:15,812 --> 00:40:16,845
I know,

526
00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:22,626
but you'll have to decide
which one of us you want dead the most.

527
00:40:22,746 --> 00:40:24,309
Prince John or me.

528
00:40:25,121 --> 00:40:28,331
Because as much as I hate Robin Hood,
he loves his country.

529
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:31,960
And he won't give you a second shot.

530
00:40:47,481 --> 00:40:48,701
Arrest him!

531
00:40:55,673 --> 00:40:56,675
Stop!

532
00:40:56,795 --> 00:40:59,120
Anyone who draws blood
in the house of God

533
00:40:59,281 --> 00:41:01,360
will be damned for all eternity.

534
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,520
If God had wanted you to have the crown,
He'd have given it to you.

535
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:41,600
- Robin! I've got it, I've got it!
- Come on!

536
00:41:50,394 --> 00:41:53,211
- Quick! Stop them!
- Let them go!

537
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,640
Fragile!

538
00:42:06,742 --> 00:42:09,654
This is what happens
when you employ incompetents.

539
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:14,120
I trust you will not make
the same mistake, Sheriff.

540
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:18,742
Fear not, sire.
By the time you return,

541
00:42:18,862 --> 00:42:21,480
I intend to have Robin Hood in shackles
alongside my brother.

542
00:42:25,118 --> 00:42:26,341
Or coffins.

543
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,289
That's far enough.

544
00:42:37,579 --> 00:42:39,369
What is the meaning of this?

545
00:42:55,315 --> 00:42:56,324
Stand.

546
00:42:57,681 --> 00:43:00,679
You know...
I think this is the first time

547
00:43:00,799 --> 00:43:03,800
we've ever stopped a carriage
to give gold back.

548
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,542
Thank you, Robin Hood.

549
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,391
England owes you
a debt of gratitude.

550
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:16,480
Just make sure Prince John pays it.

551
00:43:31,578 --> 00:43:34,640
Trouble, Isabella?
You haven't seen anything yet.

552
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,240
Don't come any closer.

553
00:43:36,596 --> 00:43:38,960
I'm your new Sheriff.
Thornton at your service.

554
00:43:39,537 --> 00:43:42,379
No-one actually seems sorry
that you're on your way out, do they?

555
00:43:42,499 --> 00:43:44,572
If I am to die then so be it.

556
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,680
I know where gold coins are buried!
Handfuls and handfuls!

557
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,479
- Where?
- Burial mound.

558
00:43:49,645 --> 00:43:51,998
They place curses on horses heads
to ward off intruders.

559
00:43:52,118 --> 00:43:53,880
You have disturbed the dead!

560
00:43:54,342 --> 00:43:56,120
I'm afraid I want to be awful.

561
00:43:56,281 --> 00:43:58,560
Then find out what it is
to be my enemy.
