1
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,159
Attention!

2
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,720
Abbot! Where in hell have you been?

3
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,880
Rome!

4
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:22,440
How dare you summon me to your quarters
like a common serf?

5
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,240
My Lord, I need you.

6
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,760
But it couldn't wait until tomorrow?

7
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,920
No.

8
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:31,818
It's too late for absolution.

9
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:36,880
You're the only one who can...
who can help me now.

10
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,279
If you're truly willing to repent
for all your sins...

11
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,280
I am.

12
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,519
Then you must make your peace
with God, my son,

13
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:44,603
and pray for His forgiveness.

14
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:49,972
Ah, well, you see, it's not God
I'm worried about... it's Prince John.

15
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:53,440
Then you really are in trouble.

16
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,880
He already has Gisborne. And it's
anyone's guess what he's doing with him.

17
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,014
Well, knowing the Prince as I do,
my advice is this.

18
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:02,240
Please him.

19
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:04,299
Please him?

20
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:09,059
What do you think
I've been doing all this time?!

21
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,876
Weaving tapestries?!

22
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,520
Look.

23
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:17,623
I have to execute Hood within one month,
otherwise I'm horse-meat.

24
00:02:17,743 --> 00:02:20,899
Well, I really don't see what you expect
me to do about Robin Hood.

25
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:24,360
Now, I've had a very long journey,
I need to return to my Abbey.

26
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,770
So if there's nothing else,
I will bid you good night.

27
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,473
Not so fast, Abbot.

28
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,950
You will assist me.

29
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:39,259
Why on earth would I do that?

30
00:02:42,887 --> 00:02:43,887
Because...

31
00:02:44,328 --> 00:02:46,760
I know... your little secrets!

32
00:02:48,176 --> 00:02:49,400
Where did you get it?

33
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:53,400
When I was looking for you at the Abbey,
I decided to do some nosing around.

34
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,040
{\So }You think you can blackmail me?

35
00:02:55,752 --> 00:02:59,385
Amazing how great men,
no matter how revered,

36
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:03,079
always have some
explosive little nugget

37
00:03:03,241 --> 00:03:05,587
hidden away, ready
for someone like me to find.

38
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:07,400
And as little nuggets go,

39
00:03:07,561 --> 00:03:09,840
this is as explosive as it gets.

40
00:03:11,221 --> 00:03:13,800
Abbot, even I was shocked.

41
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,800
- Now you listen to me!
- No! You listen to me!

42
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:20,598
You will use all your power
and your influence,

43
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:22,897
you will use the full might
of the Church,

44
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:25,480
to help me finish off Robin Hood
once and for all!

45
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,359
Otherwise, it'll be your head
on the chopping block with mine. Got it?

Episode Three
LOST IN TRANSLATION

49
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,676
You know this is my favourite thing.

50
00:04:13,857 --> 00:04:15,779
The handing out of parcels.

51
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,979
Being welcomed into the village
like sons returning from battle.

52
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,792
It's better to give than to receive.

53
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,298
You're an educated man, who said
"It is better to give than to receive"?

54
00:04:32,418 --> 00:04:34,800
It's nobody important,
just some carpenter from Nazareth.

55
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,660
Him!

56
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:41,720
Get down! Get down!

57
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:44,155
It's the Sheriff.

58
00:05:14,308 --> 00:05:15,358
Last night,

59
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:19,472
the Abbot of Kirklees came to me
and asked for my assistance.

60
00:05:21,092 --> 00:05:24,228
It has come to pass that Robin Hood

61
00:05:24,513 --> 00:05:28,221
and his gang of feral
unwashed pustules

62
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:30,931
have stolen from the Church.

63
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:37,883
What's he talking about?

64
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:42,015
I know

65
00:05:43,164 --> 00:05:44,914
that you know Robin Hood.

66
00:05:45,322 --> 00:05:47,044
I know that some of you

67
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
have come to look upon him
as a friend. Don't be fooled.

68
00:05:52,247 --> 00:05:54,447
Since his return from his travels,

69
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,200
Hood has become a Satanic killer.

70
00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:01,873
And anybody harbouring him,

71
00:06:01,993 --> 00:06:04,333
should be damned
to a heretic's death.

72
00:06:04,453 --> 00:06:05,703
At the stake...

73
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:08,999
where...

74
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,120
their flesh should be charred
from their bones.

75
00:06:14,854 --> 00:06:17,443
Now, the Abbey is under
my protection.

76
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,796
I've thrown a cordon around it
and tripled security just in case

77
00:06:23,507 --> 00:06:25,704
Hood tries to steal again.

78
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:32,349
If this village does not assist me
in capturing Robin Hood,

79
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:36,419
then it shall be deemed
infected with evil.

80
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:38,857
And it shall be wiped clean

81
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:42,520
of every living creature.

82
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:49,005
By the power vested in me

83
00:06:49,268 --> 00:06:51,953
by His Holiness Pope Celestine III,

84
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:54,835
I issue this holy edict.

85
00:06:55,798 --> 00:06:59,052
It's every man, woman
and child's sacred duty

86
00:06:59,757 --> 00:07:03,757
to help bring the demon
Robin Hood to justice!

87
00:07:05,423 --> 00:07:06,680
This is bad.

88
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,680
This is very bad.

89
00:07:08,984 --> 00:07:10,638
This is not good!

90
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:15,099
It wasn't me. I wasn't anywhere
near the Abbey last night.

91
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:16,769
Don't you understand?

92
00:07:17,222 --> 00:07:20,200
The Abbot has damned
our souls forever!

93
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:23,067
All right, all right,
less of the forever.

94
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,040
- Why would the Abbot do this?
- Only one way to find out.

95
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:28,790
No, no no...

96
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,160
Come on, Robin, we have to confront
the Abbot right now! Challenge him.

97
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,760
We need to understand why he did this,
what hold the Sheriff has over him.

98
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:38,840
If we attack the Abbey now,
it'll just confirm the Sheriff's lies.

99
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:41,360
{\Well, }Then, what do you suggest
we do about it?

100
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:42,920
We go to the people.

101
00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:46,600
We go to the people and show them
we're still on their side.

102
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:48,880
We trust the people to make up
their {\own }minds.

103
00:07:49,195 --> 00:07:51,459
{\Robin, }The people fear and love
the Church in equal measure.

104
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:54,359
Tuck's right. They'll never
believe us over the Abbot!

105
00:07:54,745 --> 00:07:56,400
Well, we'll see.

106
00:07:57,471 --> 00:08:00,459
I can't understand{\ this}. This is one of
the finest scholars of his generation.

107
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:02,497
He's spent his entire life

108
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:05,106
crusading for justice,
searching for truth...

109
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:07,640
Obviously there's something
more precious to him than the truth.

110
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:10,800
- And I need to find out what that is.
- I said we leave the Abbey alone.

111
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,210
- We need to find out...
- Tuck, that's my final word!

112
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,600
I'm busy.

113
00:09:43,601 --> 00:09:46,272
"Laborare est orare", my son.

114
00:09:47,457 --> 00:09:49,071
Always remember.

115
00:09:49,768 --> 00:09:51,775
Work is prayer.

116
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,659
<i>Bene orasse est bene studuisse.</i>

117
00:09:58,045 --> 00:10:00,784
I see. You are an assassin.

118
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,200
No.

119
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,320
Merely an inquisitor.

120
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,640
You presume I fear your blade.

121
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,240
I think you fear the Sheriff.

122
00:10:10,565 --> 00:10:14,173
What hold does he have over you
that you'd damn a man like Robin Hood?

123
00:10:14,293 --> 00:10:16,520
A man of honour and justice.

124
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,483
My son,

125
00:10:19,631 --> 00:10:22,631
there are things going on here
of such magnitude,

126
00:10:23,324 --> 00:10:26,980
of such complexity as to be
beyond your understanding.

127
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:30,136
Try me.

128
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:39,837
Once you see what is hidden here,

129
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:42,560
you will understand
why I had to do this.

130
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,420
You know me, my son.

131
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:48,080
Have faith in me again.

132
00:10:59,877 --> 00:11:01,816
Guards! Seize him!

133
00:11:42,114 --> 00:11:43,619
I came here to help you.

134
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:45,475
No-one can help me.

135
00:11:46,343 --> 00:11:47,414
Take him.

136
00:12:01,882 --> 00:12:05,411
- Shouldn't we be looking for Tuck?
- I don't trust that monk.

137
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:07,400
He can look after himself.

138
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,661
We've important work here.

139
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:21,240
What are you doing here?

140
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:25,116
We just wanted to make sure
you were provided for.

141
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:29,560
I can't accept it.

142
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:34,240
- And nor will anyone else.
- After all we've done for you people?

143
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:37,286
All we've sacrificed?
And this is how you treat us, is it?

144
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:39,506
And what about what I've sacrificed?

145
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,101
What we're all sacrificing every day

146
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:44,559
while you and the Sheriff
play out your little war games.

147
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:48,520
We can't take the risk, Robin, not now
the church has branded you a heretic.

148
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,974
Oh, come on!

149
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,839
You don't buy all
that mumbo jumbo, do you?

150
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,240
The Abbot of Kirklees is a great man.
He wouldn't lie.

151
00:12:56,401 --> 00:13:00,120
Rebecca, the Sheriff is using
the Abbot to frighten you.

152
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:03,400
- Well, it worked.
- Well, let us protect you!

153
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,610
Protect us?

154
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:08,920
Where was your protection
when my boy needed it?

155
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:14,831
Your boy died for justice...
and truth.

156
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:19,200
Don't let that all go for nothing.

157
00:13:19,502 --> 00:13:23,259
Robin, even you can't
take on the Church and win.

158
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:25,259
Robin, the Sheriff's men!

159
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:28,429
You can't be seen here.
Quick! Come on, get inside!

160
00:13:54,184 --> 00:13:55,000
Robin.

161
00:13:55,838 --> 00:13:56,838
<i>This...</i>

162
00:13:57,763 --> 00:14:00,113
- is one of Hood's men!
- It's Tuck.

163
00:14:00,828 --> 00:14:03,296
Last night he broke into the Abbey.

164
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,160
- What are you thinking?
- We can't just hand them over.

165
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:09,160
They're heretics now.
You'll get us all killed.

166
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,960
They've been good to us.
I can't just see them hanged, or worse.

167
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,779
Kate, don't be a fool.

168
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:16,840
Don't be like your brother.

169
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,040
<i>This is what...</i>***

170
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:22,051
- Ten. We can take them.
- We can't save Tuck now.

171
00:14:22,242 --> 00:14:24,760
If we go out{\ there}, the Sheriff'll know
the people are sheltering us.

172
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:28,139
- He's still one of us.
- We are not going out there!

173
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:31,179
He's baiting us. We are not
playing the Sheriff's game.

174
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:32,532
We stay put.

175
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:34,225
<i>Look at him!</i>

176
00:14:37,027 --> 00:14:40,160
Trapped like a wild animal
caught in the snare.

177
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:46,240
Is this how you want to end up?

178
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,650
I'm your friend.

179
00:14:53,696 --> 00:14:56,624
Yes, I know. We've had
our hard times

180
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,300
but we will come through.

181
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,640
Now,

182
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,893
who will help me capture Robin Hood?

183
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:19,040
Are you so blind
that you cannot see?

184
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,320
I am not your enemy, Hood is.

185
00:15:24,306 --> 00:15:27,229
I have not forsaken you,
forsaken God.

186
00:15:27,832 --> 00:15:28,880
Hood has!

187
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:33,659
If you do not assist me
in the capture of Robin Hood,

188
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,908
then things will only get worse.

189
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:38,087
Beginning with our friend here.

190
00:15:38,207 --> 00:15:41,297
Who will be torn apart
on the rack tomorrow.

191
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:45,658
And unless you want the same
for yourselves and your loved ones,

192
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,099
then you better come to your senses.

193
00:16:24,349 --> 00:16:26,215
You're no longer welcome here.

194
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:30,560
And if any of you come again,
we'll have no choice but to turn you in.

195
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:33,221
We have to protect ourselves now.

196
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:36,952
Go...

197
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,200
and stay gone.

198
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,533
Forever.

199
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,175
Let's go.

200
00:17:20,435 --> 00:17:21,546
Leave us.

201
00:17:25,731 --> 00:17:27,575
He sent you, hasn't he?

202
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,778
Why is a man of learning prepared
to sacrifice himself for a common thief?

203
00:17:32,898 --> 00:17:34,936
Robin Hood is the last hope
for this country.

204
00:17:35,056 --> 00:17:37,062
An outlaw? I don't think so.

205
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:38,939
You've seen the face
of these people.

206
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,179
They're crying out for inspiration,
for guidance.

207
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:43,499
The Church can offer
people guidance.

208
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:46,929
- The Church is lying to them.
- Unless you give up Hood,

209
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:48,739
Locksley is damned to death.

210
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:52,040
Women, children,
the Sheriff will stop at nothing.

211
00:17:56,357 --> 00:17:59,619
There was a time when you'd never
let yourself be so intimidated.

212
00:17:59,739 --> 00:18:02,259
When you would defend a pauper
against a Cardinal.

213
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:05,628
You may have no care for your own life
my son, but surely...

214
00:18:05,748 --> 00:18:08,000
surely you don't want
innocents to die?

215
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
Why have you lost your stomach
for the fight?!

216
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,970
Not so, my son, not so.

217
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:16,760
I have simply chosen
a different battleground.

218
00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:19,257
And what battleground is that?

219
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:21,101
I know you, Abbot.

220
00:18:22,499 --> 00:18:24,480
I studied your writings
when I was a boy.

221
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:27,059
Your translations
of Aristotle, of Plato.

222
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,499
I followed your teachings
like an apostle.

223
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:33,419
Unless you give up Hood,
there's nothing more I can do for you.

224
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:36,480
Your battleground has always been
the words of great men.

225
00:18:37,037 --> 00:18:40,299
Your mission was always to bring
enlightenment to ordinary people.

226
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,640
- How has that changed?!
- Tuck...

227
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:46,204
Tuck...

228
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:49,561
some words are more dangerous
than others!

229
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:53,451
Some words are deemed
too holy to be translated.

230
00:18:58,109 --> 00:18:59,709
Oh, sweet heavens, no.

231
00:19:01,939 --> 00:19:03,419
No, it can not be.

232
00:19:05,772 --> 00:19:07,168
The Holy Bible?

233
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:10,000
In English?

234
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,739
But the Pope has decreed
it remained in Latin.

235
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:15,509
Now you see why I have
to tread carefully.

236
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,480
Look.

237
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,180
Look, my son.

238
00:19:25,475 --> 00:19:28,520
If I give all I possess to the poor
and surrender my...

239
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,090
body to the flames,
but have not love,

240
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:32,869
I gain nothing.

241
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:36,520
"St Paul's letter
to the Corinthians."

242
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,180
Ten years hard toil.

243
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:41,063
This could change everything.

244
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:45,384
Give the people the power
to interpret the will of God.

245
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:47,480
It would be a revolution.

246
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,676
I have to stop the Sheriff
burning my book.

247
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,740
So this is why you are
the Sheriff's slave.

248
00:19:55,047 --> 00:19:58,674
He will destroy it unless I can
make you betray Hood.

249
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:01,751
Join with me.

250
00:20:06,546 --> 00:20:09,150
I will never... betray him.

251
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,920
Then I fear for your life, my son.

252
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,339
How much for two barrels of tar?

253
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:34,360
You got to have a signed warrant
from the Sheriff to purchase tar.

254
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:36,908
<i>How much to make sure
you{\ and your family} are provided for?</i>

255
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,200
How about that?<i></i>

256
00:20:38,361 --> 00:20:39,884
Will you cover for me?

257
00:20:40,004 --> 00:20:41,663
Where are you going?

258
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:48,063
All right. Be careful though, yeah?

259
00:20:48,891 --> 00:20:49,891
Thanks.

260
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:51,560
How much?

261
00:20:52,215 --> 00:20:54,459
Don't just stand there
gawping this time, eh?

262
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:57,205
Say... Tell her she's perfect.

263
00:20:57,787 --> 00:21:00,237
Women love to hear
that sort of thing.

264
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,776
Kate? I have to talk to you.

265
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,462
The Sheriff's guards
slaughtered all our animals.

266
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:33,932
- Because we didn't give up Robin.
- I want to help you.

267
00:21:35,412 --> 00:21:37,690
I care about you, Kate.

268
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:42,179
- Why are you doing this?
- Because...

269
00:21:45,927 --> 00:21:47,703
I think you're perfect.

270
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,950
Perfect?

271
00:21:52,367 --> 00:21:53,600
Is that a joke?

1
00:21:54,502 --> 00:21:55,817
I look at you

2
00:21:57,831 --> 00:21:59,228
and I want to...

3
00:22:02,213 --> 00:22:03,433
protect you.

4
00:22:03,921 --> 00:22:06,719
Can't you see you're just
making things worse?

5
00:22:07,712 --> 00:22:08,713
Maybe.

6
00:22:10,737 --> 00:22:13,037
Well, I'm sorry.
I can't help it... I've never...

7
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:15,823
Look, nothing could ever
happen between us. Ever.

8
00:22:15,943 --> 00:22:17,423
Do you understand?

9
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:20,707
You're dirty,
you smell and you're trouble.

10
00:22:21,457 --> 00:22:23,720
The best thing you could do
is just vanish.

11
00:22:48,557 --> 00:22:49,888
Brother Tuck.

12
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:54,791
For crimes against God, the Church
and the faithful of Nottingham,

13
00:22:56,064 --> 00:22:58,537
you are to be racked,
drawn and quartered.

14
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,417
Beautiful day.

15
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,896
Almost makes you want
to burst into song.

16
00:23:10,016 --> 00:23:11,777
You start off, I'll harmonize.

17
00:23:11,897 --> 00:23:13,107
Oh. Humour.

18
00:23:14,846 --> 00:23:17,516
Well, perhaps you need to know that

19
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:21,854
my favourite moment
of this delightful little procedure

20
00:23:22,953 --> 00:23:26,573
is when you hear
that great big pop pop pop pop!

21
00:23:28,347 --> 00:23:29,977
This isn't over, Sheriff!

22
00:23:30,297 --> 00:23:33,297
Oh, really? What, you think
Hood's going to rescue you, do you?

23
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:35,017
Well, I don't see him.

24
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,295
Hood! Hood?

25
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:39,297
Hoody Hoody...

26
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,320
Come out wherever you are.

27
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:55,133
Come back! Cowards! Back!

28
00:23:59,401 --> 00:24:00,524
You took your time!

29
00:24:00,644 --> 00:24:03,017
- We were a bit stretched.
- Watch out!

30
00:24:08,742 --> 00:24:10,555
Where is the second relief?!

31
00:24:32,881 --> 00:24:33,881
A cloth!

32
00:25:04,288 --> 00:25:08,000
I just thought I'd put the spark
back into our relationship, Sheriff!

33
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:20,849
I thought I doubled the guard!

34
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:23,206
Or did I just double
the incompetence?

35
00:25:24,212 --> 00:25:26,403
You've allowed Hood to escape again!

36
00:25:27,624 --> 00:25:30,137
You're more useless than Gisborne!

37
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,880
Tomorrow it's St Barnabus's day.

38
00:25:40,396 --> 00:25:42,800
- All the people will be in the Abbey.
- Yes.

39
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,842
We must give them
something concrete.

40
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:47,280
Something they can touch,
feel and smell.

41
00:25:47,441 --> 00:25:50,391
They don't need to touch
or feel God to believe.

42
00:25:50,693 --> 00:25:53,848
Idiot. These people need
to be frightened out of their wits.

43
00:25:54,592 --> 00:25:56,491
What on earth
would you have me tell them?

44
00:25:56,611 --> 00:26:00,611
That the hand of God'll strike them down
if they don't help you capture Hood?

45
00:26:04,842 --> 00:26:06,552
What did you just say?

46
00:26:07,393 --> 00:26:09,057
The hand of... Oh.

47
00:26:10,915 --> 00:26:12,246
Oh, this is good.

48
00:26:12,743 --> 00:26:15,717
- This is tremendous.
- Divine inspiration?

49
00:26:15,837 --> 00:26:18,360
I don't give Him the credit,
no, this was all me.

50
00:26:21,765 --> 00:26:25,417
I want every wretched villager
from Locksley in the Abbey tomorrow.

51
00:26:25,811 --> 00:26:29,457
I'll give them a St Barnabus's day
they'll never forget!

52
00:26:35,432 --> 00:26:38,286
- You disobeyed me.
- I had no choice.

53
00:26:38,721 --> 00:26:40,120
Tuck, we never act alone!

54
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:43,490
I had to find out what hold
the Sheriff had over the Abbot.

55
00:26:44,393 --> 00:26:46,355
- And did you?
- Oh, yes.

56
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:49,319
- Yes, I did.
- Well?

57
00:26:50,061 --> 00:26:52,799
The Abbot has translated
the Bible into English.

58
00:26:55,597 --> 00:26:56,679
The Bible?

59
00:26:57,627 --> 00:26:59,348
- In English?
- Yeah.

60
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,199
Oh, hang on, hang on. The Holy Bible

61
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,200
- in English?
- That's right, yes.

62
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,919
Adam and Eve,

63
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:14,519
the flood, Moses.

64
00:27:15,452 --> 00:27:17,440
- In English?
- You catch on fast, don't you?

65
00:27:20,217 --> 00:27:22,560
Loaves and fishes,
crucifixion, resurrection,

66
00:27:22,914 --> 00:27:25,280
- the Final Judgement, all in English?
- Much!

67
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,360
- Is that even allowed?
- No!

68
00:27:27,988 --> 00:27:30,417
- It's blasphemy!
- No, John, no!

69
00:27:30,746 --> 00:27:32,057
It's progress.

70
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:34,523
It's taken ten years

71
00:27:35,736 --> 00:27:37,742
and it'll enlighten a nation.

72
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,890
Tuck.

73
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,497
Thank you, thank you.

74
00:27:44,257 --> 00:27:46,800
We have to get the Abbot
to reverse his edict against us.

75
00:27:47,364 --> 00:27:49,828
There's a special service
tomorrow morning.

76
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:51,400
St Barnabus's day.

77
00:27:51,658 --> 00:27:54,560
- Everyone will be there.
- Including the Sheriff and his men.

78
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,720
So we have to find that Bible,
right?

79
00:27:58,138 --> 00:28:00,915
- Allan, you go with Tuck.
- All right.

80
00:28:01,368 --> 00:28:03,360
He's the only man
who knows what to look for.

81
00:28:03,521 --> 00:28:07,400
You know the castle better than anyone.
When you find the Bible, bring it to us.

82
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,511
- Where?
- The Abbey, Allan.

83
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:12,921
If the Sheriff is using the Bible
to make the Abbot lie,

84
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:15,480
it's what we'll use
to make him tell the truth.

85
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:25,882
Keep digging!

86
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,322
Keep digging! Faster!

87
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:48,040
Oh, God.

88
00:28:49,577 --> 00:28:50,878
Dear Lord, no.

89
00:28:51,979 --> 00:28:54,097
Stop this horror at once!

90
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,817
They're digging up graves now!

91
00:28:59,427 --> 00:29:01,137
Told you it was tremendous.

92
00:29:03,988 --> 00:29:07,777
Holy Relics. Something that they can
touch and feel and smell.

93
00:29:07,961 --> 00:29:09,208
Holy Relics?

94
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:11,337
The bones of Saint Luke.

95
00:29:11,457 --> 00:29:14,751
Or more specifically
the hand of the great healer Saint Luke.

96
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:17,349
Kept for safety at Kirklees Abbey.

97
00:29:18,121 --> 00:29:20,457
The precious treasure
Hood was after.

98
00:29:23,537 --> 00:29:27,238
The first body we exhumed was no good.
Funny, really - you'll like this.

99
00:29:27,681 --> 00:29:31,120
In life he was a thief. Had both
his hands chopped off, at my orders.

100
00:29:31,385 --> 00:29:34,140
- This is heinous.
- I know.

101
00:29:34,653 --> 00:29:37,040
But there is a kind of
poetic irony to it, I think?

102
00:29:37,201 --> 00:29:40,137
No more.
I will no longer be your whipping boy.

103
00:29:40,914 --> 00:29:41,914
Abbot!

104
00:29:51,274 --> 00:29:52,274
Please!

105
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,116
Tomorrow morning,

106
00:29:55,095 --> 00:29:56,537
you will preside...

107
00:29:56,721 --> 00:29:59,377
- No!
- ... over the ceremony.

108
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,497
You will stand alone,

109
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,308
nodding happily,
with your mouth tightly shut,

110
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,497
agreeing with everything that I say,

111
00:30:11,617 --> 00:30:14,730
otherwise the rest of your Bible
becomes toast!

112
00:30:41,936 --> 00:30:43,887
- It'll be big.
- Right.

113
00:30:50,768 --> 00:30:51,768
Look.

114
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:08,586
Allan.

115
00:31:17,741 --> 00:31:18,741
This is it.

116
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,142
It's the Bible.

117
00:31:24,761 --> 00:31:26,777
We need to get a move on, Tuck.

118
00:31:27,109 --> 00:31:28,183
Yeah.

119
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:24,645
<i>Tedii, Tedium, Tedius!</i>

120
00:32:25,099 --> 00:32:27,737
That's quite enough of that rubbish.

121
00:32:31,697 --> 00:32:32,822
My children.

122
00:32:36,004 --> 00:32:38,310
I was once lost, like you.

123
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:41,479
Wretched like you.

124
00:32:42,467 --> 00:32:44,599
Wandering in the wilderness.

125
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:47,239
But it was there, in the desert

126
00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:49,806
crawling on my hands and knees

127
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:52,372
like a dried crab...

128
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:56,270
that I was guided...

129
00:32:57,307 --> 00:32:58,340
to a cave.

130
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:01,657
And it was in that cave...

131
00:33:03,758 --> 00:33:05,421
that I found this...

132
00:33:06,761 --> 00:33:09,577
the hand of the divine physician...

133
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,413
Saint Luke!

134
00:33:18,657 --> 00:33:21,799
It was this hand... that healed me.

135
00:33:22,795 --> 00:33:24,600
Healed me of my pain,

136
00:33:25,321 --> 00:33:28,871
guided me on the path to salvation

137
00:33:28,991 --> 00:33:31,477
and cleansed me of all my sins!

138
00:33:34,628 --> 00:33:35,959
And it was this

139
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:39,931
holy artefact that Robin Hood
and his gang of men

140
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:43,800
tried so flagrantly to steal,
not once, 

141
00:33:44,744 --> 00:33:45,873
but twice!

142
00:33:46,466 --> 00:33:50,297
That is why Robin Hood and his
gang attacked the brothers of Kirklees.

143
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:54,137
That is why Hood sent in his thug Tuck
to break into the Abbey.

144
00:33:54,321 --> 00:33:57,134
And that is why Hood
must burn at the stake!

145
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,779
Wrong way.

146
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:05,247
Get the Bible to Robin!

147
00:34:33,835 --> 00:34:36,537
Lock down the Castle!
Search every room!

148
00:34:43,076 --> 00:34:44,384
No sign of them.

149
00:34:46,597 --> 00:34:48,646
There's no more time.
I have to go in now.

150
00:34:48,766 --> 00:34:51,766
- This is suicide, Robin.
- There's no other way.

151
00:34:52,077 --> 00:34:54,097
We have to go{\ in} there
and show we're not afraid.

152
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,377
If we blink now, the people
will never believe in us again.

153
00:34:57,561 --> 00:35:00,391
I did give you an ultimatum,
remember?

154
00:35:04,776 --> 00:35:05,872
So...

155
00:35:07,662 --> 00:35:08,861
where is he, eh?

156
00:35:13,786 --> 00:35:15,174
Where's Robin Hood?

157
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:17,033
I don't see him.

158
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,222
Then open your eyes!

159
00:35:24,761 --> 00:35:26,211
Oh, look.

160
00:35:27,316 --> 00:35:30,355
He's come to save the village.
How noble.

161
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:34,194
What are you going to do, Hood?

162
00:35:35,078 --> 00:35:37,556
Are you going to kill me?
Going to shoot me?

163
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:40,796
And risk bringing down the wrath
of Prince John on Nottingham?

164
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:42,720
{\Well, }I don't think you want that, do you?

165
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,880
No.

166
00:35:45,857 --> 00:35:47,048
No, I wouldn't.

167
00:35:50,843 --> 00:35:52,931
Because I love Nottingham.

168
00:35:53,857 --> 00:35:55,363
I love its people.

169
00:35:56,679 --> 00:36:00,177
And I want to see them freed
from your greed and your corruption.

170
00:36:03,174 --> 00:36:06,443
What about your greed?
And your corruption?

171
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:09,977
You attacked the Abbey
to try and steal the holy artefacts.

172
00:36:10,097 --> 00:36:11,197
I didn't.

173
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:14,320
Nor did I tax these people
till they bled

174
00:36:14,584 --> 00:36:16,920
and brutalised them
when they had nothing more to give.

175
00:36:17,081 --> 00:36:18,544
Yes, but you did

176
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,746
break into the Abbey with the intention
of stealing the Hand of Saint Luke.

177
00:36:22,984 --> 00:36:25,183
That is not the Hand of Saint Luke!

178
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:27,371
Really?

179
00:36:29,097 --> 00:36:32,337
What? Pray tell. Whose hand is it?

180
00:36:33,081 --> 00:36:34,309
Ask the Abbot.

181
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:40,015
Well, come on, Abbot.

182
00:36:40,772 --> 00:36:41,907
Tell them.

183
00:36:43,221 --> 00:36:44,600
Yes, come on, Abbot.

184
00:36:45,352 --> 00:36:48,038
- Tell them.
- The truth is always the truth.

185
00:36:49,837 --> 00:36:51,760
You can't change that with an edict.

186
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,200
Yes, and they deserve
to be told the truth.

187
00:36:55,521 --> 00:36:56,930
You tell them now

188
00:36:57,461 --> 00:36:59,308
and this is all over.

189
00:36:59,811 --> 00:37:01,303
It certainly will be.

190
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,488
If you say that relic is real

191
00:37:04,195 --> 00:37:06,497
then three innocent men will die.

192
00:37:08,382 --> 00:37:09,816
But if you deny it,

193
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,417
those people must be
released from your edict.

194
00:37:18,217 --> 00:37:21,035
And your reputation will
be ground into the dust.

195
00:37:22,061 --> 00:37:24,599
And nothing you ever say

196
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:28,725
or do will ever have
any authority ever again.

197
00:37:29,788 --> 00:37:31,968
You will be finished.

198
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:38,720
Your choice.

199
00:37:39,018 --> 00:37:42,495
And the choices we make at these moments
define us for eternity.

200
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:52,164
I decree,

201
00:37:53,442 --> 00:37:55,471
by the holy power of the Church,

202
00:37:56,551 --> 00:38:00,411
that this is the hand of
the Holy Evangelist Saint Luke.

203
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,009
Tuck was wrong about you.

204
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,912
Arrest those heretics!

205
00:38:06,988 --> 00:38:08,777
John! Enough! Enough!

206
00:38:10,401 --> 00:38:13,537
- It's over, John.
- What? No!

207
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,026
It's over.

208
00:38:30,668 --> 00:38:32,699
Your book is magnificent.

209
00:38:33,523 --> 00:38:35,440
I {\just }wonder if the world
is {\quite }ready for it.

210
00:38:35,601 --> 00:38:39,297
Tuck, this is no place for decent,
educated men. Give me my book.

211
00:38:41,561 --> 00:38:43,405
"If I give all I possess to the poor

212
00:38:43,525 --> 00:38:47,520
and surrender my body to the flames,
but have not love, I gain nothing".

213
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:49,710
- What are you going to do?
- Me?

214
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,538
- I'm going to burn this book.
- No!

215
00:38:51,658 --> 00:38:54,280
- Unless you save Robin Hood!
- Tuck, don't be a fool!

216
00:38:54,441 --> 00:38:55,573
Yes, Tuck.

217
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:57,617
Book burning is my job.

218
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:03,906
Book, please.

219
00:39:08,227 --> 00:39:09,679
I shall be holding onto that

220
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:12,484
until Robin Hood and his gang of maggots
are reduced to ashes.

221
00:39:12,604 --> 00:39:15,254
Stick him on the fire
with the rest of them.

222
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:21,801
I win.

223
00:39:26,841 --> 00:39:28,610
<i>Burn them! Burn them!</i>

224
00:39:35,921 --> 00:39:37,551
<i>Burn them! Burn them!</i>

225
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:50,970
Heretics! Devils! I trusted you!

226
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,953
Kate, please! It isn't true!

227
00:40:03,641 --> 00:40:06,228
Heretics! Devils! I trusted you!

228
00:40:09,681 --> 00:40:11,681
<i>For crimes against the Church,</i>

229
00:40:12,205 --> 00:40:15,655
- <i>heretical and blasphemous obscenity...</i>
- Come on, Robin.

230
00:40:16,074 --> 00:40:18,540
- <i>... Robin Hood...</i>
- The rope's too thick.

231
00:40:21,801 --> 00:40:24,080
- I can't get through it.
- We're toast. I knew it.

232
00:40:24,241 --> 00:40:25,608
<i>Light the fire!</i>

233
00:40:34,624 --> 00:40:36,976
Wait! One moment.

234
00:40:41,236 --> 00:40:42,236
Yes.

235
00:40:44,001 --> 00:40:46,617
He has offended the faithful,
therefore

236
00:40:46,897 --> 00:40:49,352
the faithful must condemn him.

237
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,452
The Abbot's right.

238
00:40:51,572 --> 00:40:53,842
It's the duty of every man, woman

239
00:40:55,223 --> 00:40:56,275
and child

240
00:40:57,411 --> 00:40:59,417
to destroy the heretic Robin Hood.

241
00:41:07,514 --> 00:41:10,222
Now, are you ready

242
00:41:11,311 --> 00:41:12,600
to condemn the heretic

243
00:41:13,344 --> 00:41:15,249
or be damned yourself?

244
00:41:23,201 --> 00:41:24,201
Burn them!

245
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,376
Maggie,

246
00:41:33,141 --> 00:41:34,817
Maggie, it's all right.

247
00:41:35,238 --> 00:41:36,385
Just do it.

248
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,399
Very touching. Very sweet.

249
00:41:54,401 --> 00:41:57,617
Look, I'm burning them.

250
00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:02,377
- Burn them! Burn them!
<i>- Burn them! Burn them!</i>

251
00:42:15,395 --> 00:42:18,102
Enough! People of Nottingham!

252
00:42:18,614 --> 00:42:21,573
- You have been betrayed!
- Stop him!

253
00:42:21,923 --> 00:42:24,400
Stay where you are
or your souls will be damned forever!

254
00:42:26,681 --> 00:42:28,577
You have been deceived!

255
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,097
That was not the hand of Saint Luke.

256
00:42:32,748 --> 00:42:36,497
It was a bone, sacrilegiously
disinterred from a peasant's grave.

257
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,840
It was meant to deceive you.

258
00:42:39,637 --> 00:42:41,538
It was meant to control you,

259
00:42:42,345 --> 00:42:44,599
but I stand before you
full of shame!

260
00:42:46,827 --> 00:42:49,465
- Hurry up, Much.
- This man is the true devil!

261
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,559
He steals your hopes,

262
00:42:52,796 --> 00:42:54,497
he steals your souls.

263
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,537
He is the spawn of Satan!

264
00:43:02,692 --> 00:43:03,937
I warned you!

265
00:43:04,057 --> 00:43:05,390
I warned you!

266
00:43:07,397 --> 00:43:08,720
Is everyone ready?

267
00:43:09,777 --> 00:43:11,108
I warned you!

268
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,977
Now! Now!

269
00:43:25,017 --> 00:43:26,117
No!

270
00:43:42,701 --> 00:43:46,223
I will never look at a pig
on a spit in the same way ever again.

271
00:43:52,721 --> 00:43:53,857
To the Abbot.

272
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:57,421
To the Abbot.

273
00:44:15,777 --> 00:44:18,989
"In the beginning
God created the heaven

274
00:44:20,756 --> 00:44:22,172
and the earth..."

275
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:30,817
The new tax collector comes today.
They say he is very good.

276
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,800
I've come to make Nottingham pay.

277
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:37,438
Thank you, Katie.

278
00:44:37,681 --> 00:44:40,120
You've just made it onto
Nottingham's Most Wanted list.

279
00:44:41,752 --> 00:44:45,280
Some knights in shining armour
you lot are - now I have to leave home.

280
00:44:45,659 --> 00:44:47,920
Do you ever get used to
being apart from your family?

281
00:44:48,081 --> 00:44:49,081
No.

282
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,640
You don't get used to that.
Robin is not here to save you now.
