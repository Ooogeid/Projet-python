00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:34,829
England.

2
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:41,008
I will find him.

3
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,710
- Robin, stop!
- Come on, Robin!

4
00:00:56,685 --> 00:00:57,909
Robin!

5
00:00:58,496 --> 00:01:00,739
- Do not do this!
- Give me that stuff.

6
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:02,209
What?

7
00:01:05,825 --> 00:01:06,832
Robin!

8
00:01:06,952 --> 00:01:09,179
I said stop holding me back!

9
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,750
- You can't do this alone.
- And what're you gonna do, Allan?

10
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,004
Tell me, what you gonna do?
Rat me out?

11
00:01:16,124 --> 00:01:17,240
That's a bit harsh.

12
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:19,400
Once a traitor, always a traitor.

13
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:22,920
- That's not fair.
- You shut up! You leech!

14
00:01:23,441 --> 00:01:24,741
You're pathetic!

15
00:01:25,434 --> 00:01:26,880
We're tired, Robin.

16
00:01:27,143 --> 00:01:30,515
- We've been travelling for months.
- And I've had time to think.

17
00:01:30,635 --> 00:01:32,385
And I've made up my mind.

18
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,720
I don't need you any more.
Any of you.

19
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,280
You don't mean that.
This is not you!

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,240
- Much, it's over!
- None of this!

21
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,038
- Robin Hood is finished!
- Don't say that.

22
00:01:44,158 --> 00:01:46,600
He died in the Holy Land, all right?

23
00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:49,316
With Marian.

24
00:01:50,348 --> 00:01:52,561
Now all I have left is vengeance.

25
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,200
Then let us come with you.

26
00:01:58,121 --> 00:02:00,319
Stop holding me back, I mean it.

27
00:02:00,577 --> 00:02:01,983
Get back - now!

28
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:05,381
Don't follow me.

29
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,530
It's between me and Gisborne now.

30
00:02:09,555 --> 00:02:11,055
Gisborne dies today.

Episode one
TOTAL ECLIPSE

34
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:55,254
GISBORNE!

35
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:57,537
He has come.

36
00:04:58,295 --> 00:04:59,655
Papa!

37
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,460
Where is he?

38
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:11,923
Where's everyone?

39
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:14,874
There!

40
00:05:14,994 --> 00:05:16,359
Up there! Come on!

41
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:25,381
Papa!

42
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,080
Where're you gonna run to, Gisborne?

43
00:05:44,443 --> 00:05:46,640
One more step, she goes over.

44
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,969
Please! Not my daughter!

45
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:50,920
It's all right.

46
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,120
- Don't be scared.
- I'm not. You're Robin Hood.

47
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:57,124
Gisborne, let her go.

48
00:05:57,431 --> 00:05:59,759
- I'll drop the weapons.
- You first.

49
00:06:02,747 --> 00:06:03,799
All right!

50
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,668
The time's come for you to pay
for what you did.

51
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:24,640
No. I was you.
You forced me to do it.

52
00:06:24,953 --> 00:06:26,520
You murdered her.

53
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,280
- She didn't love you.{\ Couldn't have her.}
- She should have been mine!

54
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,959
- She was my wife!
- No!

55
00:06:43,557 --> 00:06:46,520
Prepare to die... Robin Hood.

56
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:09,990
I'll kill you!

57
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:15,039
Take him away!

58
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:19,871
- No.
- They've got him!

59
00:07:19,991 --> 00:07:20,991
No!

60
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:43,195
My dear friend!

61
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,360
To what do I owe this
exquisite pleasure?

62
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:50,072
I'm here to give you
something from Prince John.

63
00:07:51,798 --> 00:07:52,798
Really?

64
00:07:53,585 --> 00:07:55,345
And what would that be?

65
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:57,214
An ultimatum.

66
00:08:08,326 --> 00:08:09,326
Robin?

67
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:11,374
John?

68
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:17,367
John?

69
00:08:17,741 --> 00:08:18,741
Is it him?

70
00:08:20,427 --> 00:08:21,240
No.

71
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:24,197
I reckon he's gone for good.

72
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:28,557
And we weren't there to save him.

73
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,430
We'd better go, John.

74
00:08:31,342 --> 00:08:35,149
Hey, we've got to think about
the living now, big man. Come on.

75
00:08:48,105 --> 00:08:49,480
This is from Prince John.

76
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:53,920
You made a pig's breakfast
of your mission in the Holy Land.

77
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:55,440
That wasn't my fault.

78
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:58,879
As a result of your blundering,
the Prince is hurting.

79
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:03,171
And he's passing on that hurt...

80
00:09:03,803 --> 00:09:06,277
by creating an extra little tax,

81
00:09:07,308 --> 00:09:08,560
just for you.

82
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:10,880
- How much?
- 1,000 crowns...

83
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:12,969
A month.

84
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,040
That's impossible.

85
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,840
Count yourself lucky. The King
wanted your head on a spike.

86
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,840
Prince John protected you,

87
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,320
and demands you repay his loyalty.

88
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,080
- Otherwise, he'll be obliged to...
- Yes?

89
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:30,247
... let you go.

90
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:34,600
He shall have his money.

91
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,911
And once and for all deal with Hood.

92
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:41,250
He's become a significant pain
in the princely backside.

93
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,640
You don't need to worry
about him any more.

94
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,040
Ah, Gisborne!

95
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,320
What do you mean?

96
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:48,953
He's dead.

97
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,622
I killed him.

98
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,337
Robin Hood is dead, by these hands.

99
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,959
Look!

100
00:10:02,155 --> 00:10:03,305
Oh, Gisborne!

101
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:07,880
This is a great day!

102
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:10,937
The outlaw is no more!

103
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,195
Let the bells sound
all over the land!

104
00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:16,159
Rejoice! Rejoice!

105
00:10:16,463 --> 00:10:19,917
Sorry to nit-pick but haven't we
been here before?

106
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,840
Shouldn't we hold the celebrations
till we have proof?

107
00:10:24,145 --> 00:10:26,960
- Proof?
- Like, where's the body?

108
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
Come on!

109
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,601
Come on!

110
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:47,387
I didn't come all this way for you
to die on me, before we've even started.

111
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,260
<i>I want every inch
of this river searched! </i>

112
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,043
<i>No one leaves
till you find the body!</i>

113
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,239
<i>Move!</i>

114
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,127
Where are you?

115
00:12:04,045 --> 00:12:05,910
Lost something, my friend?

116
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:07,680
What did you say?

117
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,240
Sir Guy, isn't it?

118
00:12:12,437 --> 00:12:14,737
Who are you? What're you doing here?

119
00:12:15,145 --> 00:12:18,595
Man of God, travelling north.
Finding shelter where I can.

120
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,490
I congratulate you on your victory.

121
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:28,760
You struck a great blow in the war
against lawlessness. Must give you joy.

122
00:12:29,086 --> 00:12:31,560
- Have you seen a body?
- No, I've seen no corpse.

123
00:12:31,761 --> 00:12:33,160
The river's taken it maybe.

124
00:12:34,185 --> 00:12:35,185
Maybe.

125
00:12:36,237 --> 00:12:38,037
You seem troubled, my son.

126
00:12:38,918 --> 00:12:41,018
Can I offer you a simple supper?

127
00:12:42,258 --> 00:12:43,921
Or a confession?

128
00:12:44,828 --> 00:12:48,628
- Soothe whatever disturbs your mind.
- No, let's keep searching.

129
00:12:49,158 --> 00:12:51,908
I need to find him,
that'll soothe my mind.

130
00:13:05,128 --> 00:13:07,320
Robin, can you hear me?

131
00:13:09,592 --> 00:13:10,856
Who are you?

132
00:13:13,612 --> 00:13:14,835
Where am I?

133
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,416
I said, who are you?

134
00:13:21,404 --> 00:13:22,765
Brother Tuck.

135
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:24,633
Now, hold still.

136
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,182
What are you...

137
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:39,225
Dislocated.

138
00:13:39,623 --> 00:13:42,673
Didn't want to touch it
till you were on the mend.

139
00:13:43,513 --> 00:13:44,763
Did I kill him?

140
00:13:46,854 --> 00:13:47,880
No.

141
00:13:48,368 --> 00:13:49,920
Well, then I have to finish...

142
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:52,440
You're not going anywhere.
Be still.

143
00:13:53,105 --> 00:13:54,850
You best let me up!

144
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:57,285
I said be still!

145
00:13:58,825 --> 00:14:00,598
Rest in peace, my son.

146
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,300
Ah Gisborne, no sign
of Hood's body, I take it?

147
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,960
You know, your future,

148
00:14:14,124 --> 00:14:16,680
your lives, are hanging by a thread.

149
00:14:17,063 --> 00:14:18,479
I'll be back{\ from Lincoln} tomorrow

150
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:20,798
to collect the Prince's money
and view the body.

151
00:14:20,918 --> 00:14:22,657
Make sure both are ready.

152
00:14:29,038 --> 00:14:32,040
So melodramatic.

153
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:33,980
A thought on the spondulicks -

154
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,760
Hood was an outlaw,
all outlaws have a stash.

155
00:14:38,218 --> 00:14:41,319
And Robin Hood is now dead,
apparently.

156
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:45,280
I want my cut, mind.

157
00:14:46,515 --> 00:14:48,324
I'm loath to say it, Gisborne.

158
00:14:48,444 --> 00:14:50,594
But for once that preening ninny,

159
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,157
he might be on to something.

160
00:15:01,743 --> 00:15:03,879
The smell of my broth
wake you, did it?

161
00:15:05,675 --> 00:15:07,560
You knocked me out.

162
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:08,938
Yep.

163
00:15:10,696 --> 00:15:11,932
Here.

164
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,247
Come on, drink this.

165
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,792
You wanna starve? Fine, starve.

166
00:15:23,912 --> 00:15:25,396
- You best untie me.
- Nope.

167
00:15:25,516 --> 00:15:27,640
I don't appreciate being
trussed up{\ here} like a pig!

168
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,749
It's for your own good, and mine.

169
00:15:29,869 --> 00:15:31,691
Now, drink this!

170
00:15:33,135 --> 00:15:34,135
Come on!

171
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:35,922
Come on!

172
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,640
Why are you doing this?

173
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,949
You know, years ago,
when I left this country,

174
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:56,853
the people of this nation were
proud, strong, full of spirit.

175
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:01,680
Now I come back to find their backs
broken, their hope shattered.

176
00:16:02,904 --> 00:16:06,554
Everywhere I go I see fear
and suspicion haunting their faces.

177
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,293
And yet everywhere, I hear one name.

178
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,679
Even from the mouths of children.

179
00:16:14,212 --> 00:16:15,939
One name, whispered in hope.

180
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:19,059
One name that keeps
the flame of England burning.

181
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
Robin Hood.

182
00:16:22,302 --> 00:16:24,802
Well, maybe that name's
all ready dead.

183
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,989
Because I'm done with it.

184
00:16:43,609 --> 00:16:44,609
So,

185
00:16:45,846 --> 00:16:46,904
how...

186
00:16:47,582 --> 00:16:49,682
how brave are you feeling today?

187
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:51,799
Rot in hell.

188
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:53,933
This brave?

189
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,119
Or this brave?

190
00:16:59,258 --> 00:17:00,808
Why don't you try me?

191
00:17:01,114 --> 00:17:02,560
Where's the money?

192
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:05,320
Hood must have had a stash
hidden somewhere.

193
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,270
Everything he had,

194
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:10,817
everything he stole from you,

195
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:13,836
he gave away.

196
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:18,512
You just don't get it,

197
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:20,708
do you?

198
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:31,301
Tell me.

199
00:17:36,197 --> 00:17:37,420
All right...

200
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:39,529
All I'm saying is, it's just us now.

201
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:42,442
- And we've got to get Much out{\ of there}.
- You're good, aren't you?

202
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,480
- What?
- Stating the obvious.

203
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,300
Well, what have you got?

204
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:48,926
Getting in's not the problem, is it?
It's getting out.

205
00:17:49,046 --> 00:17:51,685
Well, now who's stating the obvious?

206
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:54,245
Planning's not our thing, is it?

207
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,696
You know, you're muscle
and I'm more on the blagging side.

208
00:17:57,816 --> 00:18:00,524
Robin was always
the man with the plan.

209
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
Sorry.

210
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:32,574
They all look so alike - trees.

211
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:35,400
String him up.

212
00:18:36,268 --> 00:18:38,040
No, wait, wait, wait!

213
00:18:39,856 --> 00:18:40,856
It's here.

214
00:18:42,232 --> 00:18:43,080
Here!

215
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:49,999
Start digging.

216
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:53,399
Tricky.

217
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:23,599
Oh, no, no, no.
You're not going anywhere...

218
00:19:27,321 --> 00:19:28,321
Robin!

219
00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:30,758
Search over there.

220
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:32,488
Not here.

221
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Wait!

222
00:19:57,588 --> 00:20:00,461
- He's just a boy!
- Tuck. Robin Hood is dead.

223
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,120
It has to stay that way.

224
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:05,081
- I can be free of this at last!
- Wait!

225
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,840
Let me deal with it.
Let me deal with it.

226
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,020
Let me deal with it.

227
00:20:12,021 --> 00:20:13,025
OK?

228
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:19,239
Listen to me, lad.

229
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,240
You'll leave now and never return.

230
00:20:21,401 --> 00:20:24,240
You won't tell{\ a soul} what you've seen here,
or I'll come to you one night

231
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,996
and you'll die a terrible death!
Swear on your morher's life!

232
00:20:27,116 --> 00:20:30,029
- I've seen nothing, I swear!
- Go! Go!

233
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,880
I can't let you kill, Robin Hood.

234
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,959
Give me one hour
to change your mind.

235
00:20:44,766 --> 00:20:45,766
So?

236
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:47,525
Well,

237
00:20:48,478 --> 00:20:49,878
I'm pretty sure...

238
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,814
that... this wasn't the tree.

239
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,790
But...

240
00:20:55,371 --> 00:20:57,159
I reckon it might be that one.

241
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:00,919
Give me the shovel.

242
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,519
Fill it in.

243
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,480
What?

244
00:21:32,132 --> 00:21:33,396
After him!

245
00:21:33,713 --> 00:21:36,280
Get him! Quick, after him.

246
00:21:36,943 --> 00:21:37,943
Come on!

247
00:22:05,227 --> 00:22:06,653
Idiots. Idiots!

248
00:22:15,995 --> 00:22:16,995
Guards!

249
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:18,681
Guards!

250
00:22:22,035 --> 00:22:25,056
- You're all right, you're all right.
- Thanks, mate.

251
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,240
Search them! Everything they have,
everything they own, I want it.

252
00:22:39,771 --> 00:22:43,360
Bring 'em round, line 'em up.
I want all of it!

253
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,767
Gold, silver, round their necks,

254
00:22:47,273 --> 00:22:49,960
round their wrists,
in their filthy mouths!

255
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:51,919
I want the lot!

256
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,040
Every day it gets worse.

257
00:22:56,686 --> 00:22:58,922
Injustice, cruelty, corruption.

258
00:23:00,006 --> 00:23:02,132
These people suffer and they starve.

259
00:23:06,008 --> 00:23:07,808
And you'll abandon them?

260
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,459
Robin, where are you going?

261
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:16,320
I can't help them.

262
00:23:18,574 --> 00:23:20,389
I've got nothing else to give.

263
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:22,540
You will believe in yourself again,
I know it.

264
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,849
I struggled,

265
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,560
I fought, I gave everything I had.

266
00:23:32,597 --> 00:23:35,582
I even gave the life
of the woman I love.

267
00:23:39,321 --> 00:23:42,880
Why are you doing this?
Why does it matter so much to you?

268
00:23:43,648 --> 00:23:47,000
Because I have nothing in my life
except my God and my country.

269
00:23:47,418 --> 00:23:50,360
I've no family, no wife,
yet I have a full heart.

270
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:54,174
And passion must go somewhere,
Robin.

271
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,442
I'm just saying rest first.

272
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:06,040
Then maybe speak
to that scruffy gang of yours.

273
00:24:09,987 --> 00:24:12,211
I said terrible things to those men.

274
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:17,080
The bravest, most loyal men
in England. I didn't want...

275
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,296
any more blood on my hands.

276
00:24:22,373 --> 00:24:24,800
The truth is, I'd die for them.

277
00:24:25,484 --> 00:24:29,040
- Give yourself a chance.
- No, Tuck. I'm finished for good.

278
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:31,567
I walk a few yards
and I'm shattered.

279
00:24:33,704 --> 00:24:36,359
And you say I'm the last great hope
for England.

280
00:24:52,318 --> 00:24:54,199
Maybe there is a way.

281
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:13,836
Forgive me, Robin.

282
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:34,307
Sir Guy, look at me.

283
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:39,367
Look at me.

284
00:25:40,287 --> 00:25:41,290
So tired.

285
00:25:43,956 --> 00:25:46,160
Every time I close my eyes,
they come.

286
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,860
They?

287
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,880
Demons.

288
00:25:52,538 --> 00:25:54,200
Clawing at my brain.

289
00:25:57,568 --> 00:25:59,560
How can I get some peace?

290
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,400
To find peace there
must be a reckoning.

291
00:26:03,405 --> 00:26:04,520
A reckoning?

292
00:26:04,761 --> 00:26:07,440
There are outlaws
still on the loose.

293
00:26:07,681 --> 00:26:08,681
No.

294
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:11,948
Without Hood they're lost.

295
00:26:12,068 --> 00:26:14,680
It's only a matter of time
before they're caught.

296
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,200
What is it that haunts you, my son?

297
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,320
The fear.

298
00:26:24,131 --> 00:26:26,400
The fear that my enemy isn't dead.

299
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:29,836
That he's out there somewhere,
watching.

300
00:26:32,053 --> 00:26:33,056
Waiting.

301
00:26:33,631 --> 00:26:35,769
Well, then I can help you.

302
00:26:36,466 --> 00:26:38,040
Robin Hood is no more.

303
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,177
He was buried last night in secret.

304
00:26:46,341 --> 00:26:47,360
Trust me.

305
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,045
His friends will meet today
at Dead Man's Crossing.

306
00:26:51,165 --> 00:26:52,809
You can take them there.

307
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,333
Thank you.

308
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,230
Thank you.

309
00:27:06,643 --> 00:27:08,040
But if you lie,

310
00:27:08,491 --> 00:27:09,491
you die.

311
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:18,880
A poor way to say farewell.

312
00:27:27,071 --> 00:27:28,135
To Robin.

313
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:29,917
And to us.

314
00:27:31,491 --> 00:27:32,680
Goodbye, Robin.

315
00:27:35,877 --> 00:27:36,877
For ever.

316
00:27:44,377 --> 00:27:45,416
What the...?

317
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,585
- Who are you?!
- A tall dark stranger?

318
00:27:48,705 --> 00:27:50,840
Answer the question, big mouth.

319
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:53,200
You're a big lad,
but you're out of condition.

320
00:27:53,361 --> 00:27:54,361
What...?

321
00:27:58,618 --> 00:28:00,400
- Get off me!
- You want some of that?

322
00:28:00,897 --> 00:28:04,812
Er... Nah. Got a... bad arm.

323
00:28:06,506 --> 00:28:08,400
Name's Tuck.
I've just come from Robin.

324
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,161
He'd like to see you if that's...
convenient.

325
00:28:13,596 --> 00:28:16,600
- What? Robin's alive?
- Yep, he's fine.

326
00:28:16,841 --> 00:28:19,200
Be right as rain.
Just needs a bit of a rest.

327
00:28:19,361 --> 00:28:22,240
- Well, you'll see for yourself.
- He's alive?

328
00:28:23,053 --> 00:28:26,200
Alive?! He's alive!

329
00:28:26,513 --> 00:28:28,664
Hang on. I don't believe it.

330
00:28:29,414 --> 00:28:31,760
Well, he gave me this to, er,

331
00:28:32,229 --> 00:28:33,799
prove my credentials.

332
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,931
Marian's ring.

333
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:42,597
Thank you, brother.

334
00:28:47,216 --> 00:28:49,000
What's your game, eh?

335
00:28:49,788 --> 00:28:50,960
Same as yours.

336
00:28:51,385 --> 00:28:53,160
Why should I trust you?

337
00:28:54,247 --> 00:28:57,720
I think he's sorry for leaving you.
He'll explain it all himself.

338
00:28:57,991 --> 00:28:59,920
Dead Man's Crossing. Midday.

339
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:21,320
- Something's not right.
- This whole thing's not right.

340
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:22,880
He'll come.

341
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,523
Robin's alive.

342
00:29:24,777 --> 00:29:26,198
I can feel it.

343
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,806
He'll be here.

344
00:29:40,636 --> 00:29:42,680
Come to pay our respects.
Hope you don't mind.

345
00:29:42,966 --> 00:29:46,440
- What did I tell you about that monk?
- Take them away.

346
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,062
Betrayal!

347
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,800
All right...

348
00:29:50,345 --> 00:29:53,638
<i>Come on, get a move on!
Move it! Come on.</i>

349
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:56,680
God forgive me.

350
00:30:13,868 --> 00:30:16,502
The people built this
to remember Robin Hood.

351
00:30:18,588 --> 00:30:20,559
I never knew they felt like this.

352
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:24,616
You see the power you have?

353
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:27,259
This is why God spared you.

354
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:29,716
To give the people hope.

355
00:30:29,836 --> 00:30:31,214
I don't deserve it.

356
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:36,741
Gisborne's taken your friends.
They're to be put to death tomorrow.

357
00:30:43,793 --> 00:30:45,352
What should I do?

358
00:30:45,472 --> 00:30:47,226
What would Robin Hood do?

359
00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:49,959
Look into your heart, Robin.

360
00:30:50,677 --> 00:30:52,260
You'll find the answer.

361
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:07,222
Hello, boys!

362
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,800
Everything you need
to make your stay comfortable?

363
00:31:13,961 --> 00:31:17,400
No, we seem to have missed out
on the welcoming beaker of mead.

364
00:31:18,313 --> 00:31:22,010
Now, to keep you up to speed
with my schedule...

365
00:31:26,977 --> 00:31:29,720
There's a ceremony
coming up tomorrow

366
00:31:30,043 --> 00:31:33,480
to mark the final passing of your
chief and his shoddy little outfit.

367
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,672
Your ritual demise.

368
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,080
I do like a good execution.

369
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:41,040
So, your last evening on this earth.

370
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,120
And you with your old friends!

371
00:31:45,746 --> 00:31:46,746
Enjoy!

372
00:31:48,181 --> 00:31:49,960
Hey, what time you serving dinner?

373
00:31:50,121 --> 00:31:51,639
Ha-ha-ha! Very good.

374
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,811
You're right.

375
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:06,817
I can't just turn my back
on people who need me.

376
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,170
So what are you gonna do?

377
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:14,083
Well, first, I'm gonna
try and rescue my men.

378
00:32:14,203 --> 00:32:15,203
Tonight?

379
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,719
- All alone?
- Unless you've got a better idea?

380
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,140
Well...

381
00:32:23,413 --> 00:32:24,478
Actually,

382
00:32:25,556 --> 00:32:27,236
- I do.
- Oh, do you?

383
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:29,560
Well, are you gonna tell me?

384
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:41,188
Give it to me. Come on.

385
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:49,253
This is hopeless.

386
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:52,200
Your best chance
for success tomorrow is rest.

387
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:55,040
And what chance do my men have
if I can't even sharpen an arrow,

388
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,840
let alone fire one? Hey?

389
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,360
Have faith, Robin.

390
00:32:59,355 --> 00:33:00,865
You won't be alone.

391
00:33:07,954 --> 00:33:08,760
Here.

392
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:15,680
- Where did you get that?
- Round your neck when I found you.

393
00:33:24,663 --> 00:33:25,702
Thank you.

394
00:33:32,985 --> 00:33:36,622
What happens to the moon tomorrow
happens once in a generation.

395
00:33:37,753 --> 00:33:39,698
It's God's gift from the stars.

396
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:44,764
My father used to say
that when we die,

397
00:33:45,884 --> 00:33:47,407
we become stars.

398
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,310
If it's true, this time tomorrow
we could be lighting up the night sky.

399
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,836
That's a glorious thought.

400
00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:44,500
A great day for Nottingham,
its people

401
00:34:45,027 --> 00:34:46,800
and homeland security.

402
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,750
To mark the extermination
of the terrorist, Hood,

403
00:34:56,568 --> 00:34:58,880
we shall execute his rabble.

404
00:34:59,426 --> 00:35:00,759
Prepare to fire.

405
00:35:03,721 --> 00:35:06,401
<i>If they had respected
the Sheriff and his authority,</i>

406
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,157
<i>they could have avoided
punishment of this severity,</i>

407
00:35:09,277 --> 00:35:11,303
<i>and lived peaceful, rewarding lives,</i>

408
00:35:11,423 --> 00:35:13,880
<i>working for the good of this
great Shire of Nottingham.</i>

409
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,246
<i>These men made a choice to live
their lives as outlaws,</i>

410
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:19,240
<i>and now they'll receive
their just reward</i>

411
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,760
<i>for refusing to abide by the laws of
this great, great nation,</i>

412
00:35:23,084 --> 00:35:26,262
the fatal consequence
of defying Prince John

413
00:35:27,189 --> 00:35:31,189
and the authority vested in me,
the Sheriff of Nottingham.

414
00:35:32,149 --> 00:35:33,149
Fire!

415
00:35:41,201 --> 00:35:43,720
- Well, at least it's not a dull death.
- What?

416
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,907
People will be talking of this
for years, John.

417
00:35:46,027 --> 00:35:46,760
Great!

418
00:35:46,921 --> 00:35:49,999
- Ha-ha! Tasty!
- Told you it was good! Mmm?

419
00:36:00,906 --> 00:36:02,079
<i>Let's do it!</i>

420
00:36:02,441 --> 00:36:04,121
<i>This time make it flaming.</i>

421
00:36:05,742 --> 00:36:06,742
Wait!

422
00:36:11,148 --> 00:36:14,760
A last prayer, Sir Guy. We must be
merciful no matter how great the crime.

423
00:36:14,921 --> 00:36:16,405
Who are you, preacher man?

424
00:36:16,525 --> 00:36:19,280
Brother Tuck. He's the man
who brought these outlaws to justice.

425
00:36:19,816 --> 00:36:23,079
Sheriff? It is sinful to offer
no chance of absolution.

426
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:27,914
Very well, chop chop.
These boys have got a hot date.

427
00:36:32,684 --> 00:36:34,569
<i>Da, quaesumus Dominus,</i>

428
00:36:35,014 --> 00:36:38,520
<i>ut in hora mortis nostrae
Sacramentis refecti</i>

429
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,999
<i>et culpis omnibus expiati...</i>

430
00:36:46,258 --> 00:36:49,376
<i>In sinum misericordiae tuae laeti...</i>

431
00:36:49,496 --> 00:36:51,560
Always the same, these monks.

432
00:36:51,801 --> 00:36:54,320
All right, all right.
That's enough of the piety.

433
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:57,600
No amount of lah de dah words
can save their blackened souls.

434
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,266
- Fire it up!
- Wait!

435
00:37:00,397 --> 00:37:03,440
- In the name of God, wait!
- What are you doing?

436
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,600
You and {\your master }Prince John have broken
not just man's law, but the Lord's.

437
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,910
- And for this you will be punished!
- What?

438
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,036
The monk's been at the mushrooms.
Fire it!

439
00:37:12,156 --> 00:37:13,800
Soon, God will speak,

440
00:37:14,183 --> 00:37:16,902
the skies will darken
and the sun will disappear.

441
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,261
He was right!

442
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:27,360
There! It's happening!

443
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:34,001
<i>Have faith, for soon a new day
will dawn and you will be saved!</i>

444
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,791
What's happening here?
It's a trick.

445
00:37:39,567 --> 00:37:40,440
Hood.

446
00:37:41,421 --> 00:37:42,421
Robin!

447
00:37:43,001 --> 00:37:44,001
Fire!

448
00:37:45,384 --> 00:37:46,440
Fire!

449
00:37:46,601 --> 00:37:49,480
<i>For out of this darkness a legend
will rise. Hope will be re-born.</i>

450
00:37:49,641 --> 00:37:51,991
If you want something
doing properly...!

451
00:37:54,658 --> 00:37:57,720
<i>Filthy peasants,
don't anybody touch me!</i>

452
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,840
A new dawn is coming. The sun will
rise again over England's towns...

453
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,748
I'll give you something to smile
about, you whimpering pansies!

454
00:38:12,317 --> 00:38:14,079
Where have they gone?

455
00:38:22,323 --> 00:38:26,263
You see? The sun emerges again,
like England's protector.

456
00:38:27,658 --> 00:38:31,658
<i>His journey is complete. He appears
into the light and he will save you!</i>

457
00:38:32,626 --> 00:38:35,599
He has returned!
The legend is alive!

458
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:38,920
Surprise, surprise!

459
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:41,120
No, it can't be.

460
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:43,399
You incompetent fool!

461
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:49,761
No!

462
00:38:52,401 --> 00:38:53,799
I am Robin Hood,

463
00:38:54,801 --> 00:38:56,440
your humble servant.

464
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,400
It is for you that I live to fight
the evil that chokes this country.

465
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,480
No longer shall we live
in fear and darkness.

466
00:39:07,475 --> 00:39:09,493
We must stand together.

467
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,903
Only then will the sun rise
on this country,

468
00:39:14,481 --> 00:39:15,591
our England,

469
00:39:16,547 --> 00:39:17,679
once more!

470
00:39:18,001 --> 00:39:19,144
Yeah!

471
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:26,560
Get him!

472
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:28,716
Robin, a gift from the Sheriff!

473
00:39:46,881 --> 00:39:49,359
Robin? No!

474
00:39:53,684 --> 00:39:55,271
- Do it.
- What?

475
00:39:55,579 --> 00:39:58,320
- End it, please.
- You want this?

476
00:39:59,249 --> 00:40:00,440
I live in hell.

477
00:40:00,985 --> 00:40:02,320
Then stay there.

478
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:23,166
Today's humiliation has wrecked
your authority,

479
00:40:23,286 --> 00:40:25,812
with your people and Prince John,

480
00:40:26,222 --> 00:40:27,612
when I tell him.

481
00:40:28,594 --> 00:40:30,576
Back to London at last!

482
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:33,020
Goodbye, little people.

483
00:40:44,472 --> 00:40:47,481
You pathetic misery-addled mess.

484
00:40:48,601 --> 00:40:51,400
You're teetering on the edge
of dispensability, Gisborne.

485
00:40:51,561 --> 00:40:53,511
Make sure you don't fall off.

486
00:40:54,983 --> 00:40:58,240
You know, I've finally come to the
conclusion that I don't like you.

487
00:40:59,238 --> 00:41:03,008
Aw, aw, whassa matter? Mmm?

488
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:07,761
Was that nasty Robin Hood horrible
to our little Guy? Ooh, diddums!

489
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,920
That's better. You'd better show
some spine. You're gonna need it.

490
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,560
Hood gave you life,
now you go out and take his, right?

491
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,432
Now, listen, they'll come at you
with everything they have now.

492
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:32,365
- Are you ready?
- Well, they haven't seen anything yet.

493
00:41:32,485 --> 00:41:35,400
Not now there's a warrior priest
on their case, hey?

494
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:38,120
Tuck's joining our fight, lads.
He's one of us now.

495
00:41:41,093 --> 00:41:42,280
These are yours.

496
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,960
Hold on. You haven't explained how
Gisborne knew where to find us yet.

497
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:53,047
Sometimes you have to risk
a lot to win a lot.

498
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:54,992
- It worked.
- This time.

499
00:41:56,034 --> 00:41:59,781
- Next time you risk your own neck.
- I will. And happily.

500
00:42:00,201 --> 00:42:03,280
You know I can't do this without you.
Any of you.

501
00:42:04,802 --> 00:42:07,040
And I didn't mean
those things I said.

502
00:42:08,101 --> 00:42:09,240
I'm sorry.

503
00:42:09,609 --> 00:42:12,522
Robin, it's all right.

504
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,196
We understand.

505
00:42:15,316 --> 00:42:17,841
What happened today
will reverberate around England.

506
00:42:17,961 --> 00:42:21,236
The story told around every fire,
and every child's bed,

507
00:42:22,929 --> 00:42:26,160
of how the sun itself intervened
in the fight against evil.

508
00:42:26,728 --> 00:42:28,396
The Sheriff eclipsed.

509
00:42:29,131 --> 00:42:30,738
A legend reborn.

510
00:43:02,196 --> 00:43:03,880
I'll never stop loving you.

511
00:43:21,995 --> 00:43:23,760
{a6}You'll be soldiers, all of ya!{\a6}

512
00:43:23,921 --> 00:43:25,546
So say goodbye to your families.

513
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:29,666
You men, you belong to me now.
You fight well for my cause.

514
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,000
Some of you may live
to see your homes again.

515
00:43:33,241 --> 00:43:35,320
To the next King of Ireland,
my brother.

516
00:43:36,374 --> 00:43:38,520
- Who's that?
- Some girl we just saved.

517
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,080
My name is Kate.

518
00:43:40,708 --> 00:43:42,680
I am the Sheriff of Nottingham!

519
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,520
<i>You can kill me 100 times over
but the pain you're feeling now,</i>

520
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,680
Hood!

521
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:48,599
<i>... it's never gonna go away.</i>
