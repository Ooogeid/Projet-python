1
00:00:13,624 --> 00:00:15,440
My name is Robin Hood

2
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,800
and this is an ambush!

3
00:00:18,165 --> 00:00:20,120
<i>While there's people going hungry,</i>

4
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:22,360
While there's injustice
in this land,

5
00:00:22,713 --> 00:00:26,360
<i>Me and my men will fight for what's
right, and we take from the rich...</i>

6
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:28,120
... to give to the poor.

7
00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:29,874
For a fairer world.

8
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:34,101
Now you took that money off people
who can ill-afford it. So...

9
00:00:34,812 --> 00:00:36,388
we'll take it back!

10
00:00:40,819 --> 00:00:42,160
You're outnumbered.

11
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:47,336
- And what makes you think that?
- Take cover!

12
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:59,040
Now... you're outnumbered,
you're out-armed,

13
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:01,481
so get out of here.

14
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:03,760
Go on, run!

15
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:04,961
Go! Go!

16
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:15,920
We're back!

17
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,610
The Sub Wood Team

19
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,680
Episode Two: CAUSE AND EFFECT

20
00:02:00,144 --> 00:02:03,927
<i>I want the men ready
for transportation immediately!</i>

21
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,630
<i>Too old. He'll be meeting
his maker soon enough.</i>

22
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:10,021
<i>Able-bodied men only!</i>

23
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:17,743
They're making prisoners of them.

24
00:02:17,863 --> 00:02:18,863
Or slaves.

25
00:02:22,915 --> 00:02:23,979
Gisborne.

26
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:33,317
Kate, stop, they'll search the cart.
I'll lose you and your brother.

27
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:36,760
You see what they're doing? If we don't
move him now he'll be caught.

28
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:38,680
Just stay inside.

29
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:41,402
I'll get Matthew out of here.

30
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:00,195
Here's bread, a few leftovers
and a knife.

31
00:03:00,315 --> 00:03:02,720
- I don't like leaving you like this.
- Find us somewhere better

32
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,006
Yes. I'll send for you all.

33
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,480
In a hurry?

34
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:11,760
Delivery for the market
in Nottingham. I'm late.

35
00:03:13,497 --> 00:03:14,497
Search.

36
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,760
No, there's nothing in there,
there's nothing in there!

37
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:28,880
These people have taken enough.

38
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,074
One day they'll rise up and destroy you
and all men like you.

39
00:03:32,194 --> 00:03:33,590
Dangerous talk.

40
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,800
We'll soon beat that out of you.

41
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:38,440
- Take him away.
- Please, my brother, he's so young...

42
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:40,920
You tried to defy me!

43
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,640
Flog her!

44
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:44,054
Matthew!

45
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,120
Right. You better get used
to taking orders.

46
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,785
You're going to be soldiers,
all of you.

47
00:03:53,905 --> 00:03:56,005
So say goodbye to your families.

48
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:57,983
Bring them to the castle.

49
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:25,800
You're Robin Hood.

50
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,050
And you, young lady,
are lucky to be alive!

51
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,600
{\Now }You need to tell me what happened.

52
00:04:31,873 --> 00:04:34,360
I heard Gisborne say they were
taking the men to be soldiers.

53
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:37,760
Why does the Sheriff suddenly
need another army?

54
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:43,720
- Who's that
- Some girl we just saved.

55
00:04:44,252 --> 00:04:45,560
My name is Kate.

56
00:04:46,678 --> 00:04:49,440
We'll get your brother back, Kate.
I promise.

57
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,760
We all thought
you were gone forever.

58
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:55,360
My {\little }sister thinks
Robin Hood's just a story.

59
00:04:55,521 --> 00:04:59,367
Stories are important. Stronger
than truth. Heroes inspire us.

60
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:02,197
- Tuck always talks like that.
- Just nod and smile.

61
00:05:02,317 --> 00:05:04,360
Come on, we head them off
at the hollow.

62
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,120
I'm... Much by the way.

63
00:05:11,547 --> 00:05:14,953
And don't worry, I'll make sure
you're looked after.

64
00:05:15,073 --> 00:05:18,929
I mean, we'll make sure
you're looked after.

65
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:21,204
I can take care of myself.

66
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:25,880
- What are you doing?
- Shut up Allan, just shut up.

67
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,840
Get up MacMurrough,
you lazy Irish dog!

68
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:36,211
The party's over.

69
00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:41,811
Gisborne, I was
very comfortable here.

70
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,120
Very comfortable indeed.

71
00:05:45,493 --> 00:05:47,746
The rest of your men
are on their way.

72
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:50,131
I said, get up!

73
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,480
You know, big fella, you've been
riling me since I got here.

74
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,925
What say we... settle it,
sporting fashion?

75
00:06:03,825 --> 00:06:04,975
First strike.

76
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,210
Blunt edge of the blade only,
of course.

77
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,633
For the cause!

78
00:06:19,842 --> 00:06:23,612
Ireland for the Irish
under an Irish king.

79
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:27,699
- The devil with your English rule.
- My mother was French.

80
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,160
{\You know, }I hope the soldiers you've promised me
are better fighters than you are.

81
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,080
They're expensive enough.

82
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:52,047
First strike, I think.

83
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:55,152
Sure, you're already dead.

84
00:06:56,905 --> 00:06:59,720
So, Gisborne's met his match!

85
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:03,137
I like your style, MacMurrough,
very sneaky.

86
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:04,760
How's your head?

87
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:09,123
Like a hundred blacksmiths have
played the anvil behind me eyes.

88
00:07:09,358 --> 00:07:10,600
What a night!

89
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:14,160
Indeed. Make yourself
comfortable... Gisborne.

90
00:07:21,498 --> 00:07:23,048
<i>Come on, keep moving.</i>

91
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:25,080
<i>Keep in line.</i>

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,300
<i>Keep moving now.</i>

93
00:07:39,673 --> 00:07:41,980
- We take them now, right?
- No, wait for his signal.

94
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,760
- She's right, now's our chance.
- Don't mistake rashness for loyalty.

95
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,221
- Wait.
- Robin!

96
00:07:47,193 --> 00:07:49,000
- What's the matter?
- Trouble.

97
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:52,069
- Come here!
- Kate!Stop!

98
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:53,480
Where's she going?

99
00:07:53,828 --> 00:07:54,828
<i>Kate!</i>

100
00:08:10,635 --> 00:08:12,280
- Are you all right?
- Come on, Tuck.

101
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:14,400
Kate, you've put us all at risk{\ here}.

102
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,121
I had to save my brother.
{\- Nearly there.}

103
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:19,796
- Kate, {\you shouldn't have come}it's too dangerous.
- I brought help, Robin Hood.

104
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:23,680
Now!

105
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
MacMurrough!

106
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
Trouble!

107
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:32,563
- Follow my men into the forest!
- I'm right behind you.

108
00:08:32,683 --> 00:08:34,103
Into the forest!

109
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,478
Matthew! Matthew!

110
00:08:42,995 --> 00:08:44,040
You men,

111
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:46,440
you belong to me now!

112
00:08:47,353 --> 00:08:49,080
You fight well for my cause

113
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,920
and some of you may live
to see your homes again.

114
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:55,610
You cross me and you're dead.

115
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,637
It's a good job we came out
to meet them lads.

116
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:03,717
The Sheriff's men weren't exactly
protecting my... investment.

117
00:09:04,271 --> 00:09:05,765
Fine work, all of you.

118
00:09:05,885 --> 00:09:07,650
Now, move them out!

119
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,081
Here.

120
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:12,174
Take this so they won't
recognise you.

121
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:13,486
Thanks.

122
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:17,819
Thanks to you, they've got Robin!

123
00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:20,955
Did you really think you could save
your brother on your own?

124
00:09:21,075 --> 00:09:24,149
{\Look, }It was my fault as well, all right?
I went in too quick...

125
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:28,040
So who were the painted faces?
They came out of nowhere.

126
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,520
Celts. Warriors. A battle technique
based on surprise and brute force.

127
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,548
If they're working with the Sheriff,
we need a water-tight plan.

128
00:09:34,668 --> 00:09:37,018
Hold on, Tuck!
Who put you in charge?

129
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,360
- Somebody has to lead{\ in Robin's absence}.
- I don't see why it should be you...

130
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,360
- {\What, }You think it should be you after...{\ your display earlier?}
- Stop.

131
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:47,026
Where's the girl?

132
00:09:49,907 --> 00:09:53,120
Let's find her before she puts
herself and Robin in danger.

133
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,814
Whoever it was who attacked your troops
knew what they were doing.

134
00:09:56,934 --> 00:09:59,638
Nearly succeeded in freeing
my conscripts.

135
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,552
Robin Hood, a bothersome little fly.

136
00:10:05,526 --> 00:10:08,226
You brushed him aside,
well done, very good.

137
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:11,200
Where's my money?

138
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:13,690
Well, at least the men
got their work-out.

139
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,800
Saves me taking sword drill today.

140
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:18,361
Well, that's your job,
little brother!

141
00:10:18,608 --> 00:10:21,880
The men look to you for leadership.
All you do is drink and play.

142
00:10:22,717 --> 00:10:23,967
Yes, yes, well.

143
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,480
Got to keep them
hungry for the cause.

144
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:30,600
To the next King of Ireland,
my brother.

145
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:34,408
You don't take
the cause lightly, boy!

146
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,210
- Gentlemen...
- It's a sacred trust.

147
00:10:37,522 --> 00:10:38,606
Gentlemen?

148
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:40,625
Time and a place...

149
00:10:44,015 --> 00:10:45,040
Money.

150
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:47,743
You have your soldiers.

151
00:10:47,863 --> 00:10:50,534
You're playing a dangerous game,
aren't you, Sheriff.

152
00:10:50,654 --> 00:10:53,800
Supplying the enemies
of Prince John with troops.

153
00:11:00,265 --> 00:11:03,880
I know all about you two...
You have no allies.

154
00:11:04,787 --> 00:11:08,781
And this is your last chance to grab
power in Ireland and you both know it.

155
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:10,167
So...

156
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
do we seal the deal, or don't we?

157
00:11:13,142 --> 00:11:16,898
We'll exchange money for men
once we're safely on the coast{\, as planned}.

158
00:11:17,264 --> 00:11:18,314
Not before.

159
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,190
I want those two buffoons out
before anyone knows they're here.

160
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,139
Afraid Prince John will find out you're
supplying soldiers to his enemies?

161
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,259
Why...

162
00:11:32,102 --> 00:11:33,552
should he find out?

163
00:11:34,638 --> 00:11:37,216
Prince John will get
his patronage money, he has to.

164
00:11:37,336 --> 00:11:39,400
And where it comes from
is of no importance.

165
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:42,037
Is that meant to frighten me?

166
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:45,240
Look at you.
Your plans are in ruins.

167
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:47,250
The Black Knights are disbanded.

168
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,347
You're having to buy the affections of
a Prince that would rather see you dead.

169
00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:53,400
Why should I fear you?

170
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,385
Because...

171
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:00,320
... I AM THE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM!

172
00:12:02,652 --> 00:12:06,400
- You should've escaped while you could{\ had the chance}.
- I get away... we all get away.

173
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:09,080
They're men here from every village
within 30 miles.

174
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,990
You'll never save us all.

175
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:14,188
Well, I still have this.

176
00:12:14,752 --> 00:12:16,040
Come here...

177
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:19,048
Right,

178
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:21,600
some of you men
from Locksley know me.

179
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:23,811
The rest of you know what I do.

180
00:12:24,385 --> 00:12:28,333
Now we have one chance to do this
and we have to be ready to take it.

181
00:12:28,453 --> 00:12:31,080
For your villages
and for your families.

182
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:33,840
- Will you stand with me and fight?
- Yes.

183
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:39,759
<i>There she is.</i>

184
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:48,920
<i>She's trying to get in
with the servants.</i>

185
00:12:54,263 --> 00:12:56,897
<i>She's done it! Amazing.</i>

186
00:12:57,162 --> 00:12:58,789
<i> There's too many guards.</i>

187
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:00,959
So we lay a trap in the forest.

188
00:13:02,288 --> 00:13:04,799
To get to the coast,{\ road } they'll take
the prisoners through the ravine.

189
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,919
That's our best chance to attack.

190
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:09,480
- I'm not leaving Robin.
- Or Kate.

191
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:10,632
Or her.

192
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:14,090
Stay if you want to,{\ Much,} but don't expect us
to come back and rescue you.

193
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,210
Come on.

194
00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:17,391
Go on. Go!

195
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,760
You!

196
00:13:27,358 --> 00:13:29,337
Seize her! Come here!

197
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,917
- You're becoming a bit of nuisance.
- Do what you want to me.

198
00:13:37,037 --> 00:13:39,087
- I'm not scared of you.
- Really.

199
00:13:39,207 --> 00:13:41,520
But what about that precious
brother of yours?

200
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:44,000
Find her brother and hang him.

201
00:13:44,976 --> 00:13:46,836
- You can't do that.
- I just did.

202
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:50,120
- And make sure she sees him die.
- Please, he's done nothing wrong.

203
00:13:51,284 --> 00:13:54,384
The men you brought in,
I know something about them.

204
00:13:57,567 --> 00:13:59,709
They weren't just villagers.

205
00:14:04,162 --> 00:14:05,162
Talk.

206
00:14:06,832 --> 00:14:09,609
- You won't hurt my brother?
- {\I don't think }You're not in a position to bargain.

207
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:10,880
What about the men?

208
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:14,518
One of them is...

209
00:14:15,676 --> 00:14:16,880
is Robin Hood.

210
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,880
The front line with me,
hold off the guards.

211
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:24,328
The second line attack the gates.

212
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:27,487
Use the chains, anything
you can find as weapons.

213
00:14:27,607 --> 00:14:29,057
Wait for my signal.

214
00:14:32,976 --> 00:14:36,390
- They don't look like much.
- Well, I'm giving them to you, Tiernan.

215
00:14:36,561 --> 00:14:38,680
They're yours to train and lead.

216
00:14:39,151 --> 00:14:41,702
You expect me to make soldiers
out of peasants?

217
00:14:41,822 --> 00:14:42,822
No.

218
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,360
Sergeant! Extra guards, now!

219
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:48,280
Robin Hood!

220
00:14:48,441 --> 00:14:50,193
Ready? Hold.

221
00:14:51,071 --> 00:14:52,075
Now!

222
00:14:58,936 --> 00:15:02,624
No weapons and yet they fight
like lions for that man.

223
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:04,640
Secure the gates!

224
00:15:08,598 --> 00:15:09,400
Hood!

225
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:10,920
Wait, wait. Stop!

226
00:15:13,668 --> 00:15:15,930
- Another move and I kill the girl.
- Kate!

227
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,400
Wait!

228
00:15:18,282 --> 00:15:19,652
No, Matthew!

229
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:21,021
Matthew, no!

230
00:15:23,732 --> 00:15:26,186
Are you all right? Let me help you.

231
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:31,485
You're surrounded.
Don't waste any more lives.

232
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:34,794
- I'm here Matthew, Matthew...
- Kate.

233
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,904
I'm here... I'm here,
Matthew... I'm here.

234
00:15:38,995 --> 00:15:40,760
I'll do anything, {\I'll do}anything you say.

235
00:15:41,137 --> 00:15:43,175
Please, please help him...

236
00:15:44,772 --> 00:15:46,068
Lie still, lie still.

237
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,405
I'm going to get you home,
you're going to be all right.

238
00:15:48,525 --> 00:15:50,280
Everything is going to be all right.

239
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:52,478
Find a better place,

240
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,960
and take care of our family.

241
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:58,360
It's up to you now...

242
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:09,593
Matthew? Matthew? No...

243
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:12,360
You'll pay for this, Gisborne.

244
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,720
Get the girl out of the castle.

245
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:18,984
Come on!

246
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,709
No, no, no...

247
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:26,760
- Say your prayers, outlaw.
- Gisborne!

248
00:16:27,761 --> 00:16:29,760
You move, Gisborne, and you die.

249
00:16:30,382 --> 00:16:32,050
I will have his blood!

250
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:35,120
- Don't be so selfish.
- Get off me, he dies now!

251
00:16:35,544 --> 00:16:36,594
Come, come,

252
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:41,801
surely you don't want to miss the SLOW
and painful death of Robin Hood?

253
00:16:54,109 --> 00:16:55,126
Up, up.

254
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,880
Kate, it's me.

255
00:17:03,886 --> 00:17:05,446
What happened?

256
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:14,061
We call this room the Vault.

257
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:16,239
One door,

258
00:17:16,988 --> 00:17:20,283
solid oak, three locks,
no windows, just...

259
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:23,958
- lots of stone.
- A challenge.

260
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:27,080
It's the last room you'll ever know.

261
00:17:28,561 --> 00:17:31,511
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

262
00:17:31,775 --> 00:17:33,520
I'm gonna make you suffer
before you die.

263
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,990
Just like you're suffering,
Gisborne?

264
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:41,133
You know you could kill me 100 times
over, but the pain you're feeling now,

265
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:43,475
the hatred, the self-loathing

266
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:45,888
is never going to go away.

267
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,157
You'll never hate me
as much as you hate yourself!

268
00:17:54,277 --> 00:17:55,510
Put it away!

269
00:17:57,183 --> 00:17:59,014
Always in such a rush?

270
00:18:00,423 --> 00:18:03,873
Sometimes I think you don't appreciate
the poetry of pain.

271
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:08,176
Something clearly Robin Hood does.

272
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,660
So,

273
00:18:11,975 --> 00:18:15,880
how about the death of a thousand cuts,
a nasty Saracen invention.

274
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,240
As long as he dies.

275
00:18:28,864 --> 00:18:30,320
A visitor.

276
00:18:30,746 --> 00:18:33,480
I won't shake your hand
if you don't mind.

277
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:36,330
They tell me you were once
a nobleman.

278
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:41,127
That you gave up your title,
lost your lands, lost all your wealth...

279
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,543
The people have endured far worse.

280
00:18:43,663 --> 00:18:46,647
They told me that you lost
the woman you loved.

281
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,521
What do you want from me, Irishman?

282
00:18:53,443 --> 00:18:55,280
We're the same, you and me.

283
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,799
We both have a cause.

284
00:18:58,434 --> 00:18:59,708
But you, Robin,

285
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:03,622
you inspire men.
I've seen it. Right here.

286
00:19:04,694 --> 00:19:05,694
You see,

287
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:08,463
my people, well...

288
00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:12,600
my people are as oppressed
by this Prince John as your people.

289
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,575
And yet... they will not rise
at the call of Finn MacMurrough.

290
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:18,670
And you want my help?

291
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,080
I want you to join forces with me.

292
00:19:21,843 --> 00:19:23,800
We can learn from each other,
you and me.

293
00:19:24,804 --> 00:19:28,093
Together we can smash
this Prince John, the Sheriff,

294
00:19:28,573 --> 00:19:29,673
all of them.

295
00:19:30,241 --> 00:19:34,131
I'll help you free England,
you help me free Ireland.

296
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,306
We can both be Kings!

297
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:38,903
Now, what do you say to that?

298
00:19:42,742 --> 00:19:44,560
England already has a king.

299
00:19:49,143 --> 00:19:51,909
Richard. His name is Richard.

300
00:19:53,075 --> 00:19:54,760
I only have to shout.

301
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,120
There's half a battalion out there.

302
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,025
You think over
what I've said to you.

303
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:08,608
Perhaps you don't want a crown,
but...

304
00:20:08,728 --> 00:20:12,093
a just and fair country,
if that's what you want.

305
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,140
I might be the only chance
you have left.

306
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:33,600
Thank you very much.

307
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,035
So they tried to fight their way out
and that's when her brother was killed.

308
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:40,989
And then all hell broke loose.
Gisborne found out Robin was

309
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:43,760
with them and now he's in the castle,
heavily guarded.

310
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,048
Right. We go to Nottingham.

311
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:48,939
We'll be back.

312
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:51,370
What about the village men?
They're shipping them {\out to Ireland }today!

313
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,090
Robin is our priority.

314
00:20:53,855 --> 00:20:57,855
Losing an entire generation of men will
kill all the villages for miles around.

315
00:20:59,034 --> 00:21:01,556
- You put one man before stopping that?
- Kate,

316
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:04,553
villages are dying across England.

317
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:07,860
The only thing the people have
is a spark of hope called Robin Hood.

318
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,938
He's more important
than any one man.

319
00:21:10,058 --> 00:21:12,920
He's an idea. Something that people
can believe in.

320
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:16,391
I gave up Robin Hood to Gisborne.

321
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,974
You what? You didn't say that.

322
00:21:21,818 --> 00:21:23,068
I'd do it again

323
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:25,040
to save my little brother.

324
00:21:26,364 --> 00:21:29,640
He wasn't important enough.
He was just a village man

325
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,880
who wanted to raise a family
and live an honest life.

326
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:35,029
Well, I believed in him.

327
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:38,032
Now he's dead.

328
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:43,439
And you think...
that the idea of Robin Hood

329
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,987
is more important than his life?

330
00:21:48,328 --> 00:21:49,678
You make me sick.

331
00:22:29,811 --> 00:22:31,120
Hello, little fella?

332
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:35,534
Where did you come from?

333
00:22:42,434 --> 00:22:45,560
I might just have found
my way out of here...

334
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:00,205
Just run that by me again,
we're going to do what?

335
00:23:00,325 --> 00:23:02,880
We're going to break
Robin Hood out of here.

336
00:23:04,296 --> 00:23:06,857
It must be all this English air,
you're not thinking straight.

337
00:23:06,977 --> 00:23:10,341
Tiernan, for once in your life
would you stop looking for an easy ride

338
00:23:10,461 --> 00:23:13,261
and recognise what's
staring you in the face!

339
00:23:14,412 --> 00:23:17,000
Robin Hood's no ordinary outlaw.

340
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:20,040
He's one of us.
Fighting a tyrant - the Sheriff.

341
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,138
You told me to do the deal.

342
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:26,880
- We had nowhere else to go.
- Now we do. Robin Hood.

343
00:23:27,664 --> 00:23:31,664
Look, with a man like that alongside us,
our Irish people will rise.

344
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,160
They'll fight. I'm sure of it.

345
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:40,040
You've lost the fire, baby brother.
If you ever really had it.

346
00:23:44,643 --> 00:23:45,886
Are you with me?

347
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:54,768
Tiernan!

348
00:24:13,361 --> 00:24:15,809
I'd never have fitted
through there anyway.

349
00:24:17,198 --> 00:24:19,417
Come on Robin, come on, think.

350
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,040
Please God, come on.

351
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,750
Ready?

352
00:24:51,901 --> 00:24:53,022
Here we go...

353
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:06,389
Yes, you little dancer!

354
00:25:16,656 --> 00:25:17,656
Fire!

355
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:20,169
Fetch water!

356
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,644
Fire!

357
00:25:22,034 --> 00:25:24,200
You, get the prisoner out of there.

358
00:25:24,361 --> 00:25:25,361
Open up!

359
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,921
No, no, no, no, no.

360
00:25:31,675 --> 00:25:35,219
I'm afraid your privileges in my castle
are cancelled, my friend.

361
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:37,438
An old trick...

362
00:25:38,077 --> 00:25:39,476
but a very good one.

363
00:25:41,575 --> 00:25:43,766
- Tiernan?
- Sorry brother.

364
00:25:44,706 --> 00:25:47,088
The Sheriff here made me realise
the problem

365
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:48,680
is not with our cause.

366
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,160
No, though a very worthy endeavour.

367
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:54,440
- It's with the man who's leading it.
- You fool.

368
00:25:55,065 --> 00:25:56,914
I found a real ally right here.

369
00:25:57,644 --> 00:26:00,857
Yes, in exchange
for a few small trifles,

370
00:26:02,072 --> 00:26:03,130
County...

371
00:26:03,527 --> 00:26:05,000
Galway I believe.

372
00:26:05,323 --> 00:26:08,456
You haven't the sense to lead an army,
let alone a nation.

373
00:26:09,451 --> 00:26:10,468
Says you.

374
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,099
But the men are with me.

375
00:26:17,272 --> 00:26:19,395
Didn't take much persuasion mind,
but then again

376
00:26:19,515 --> 00:26:23,415
all you offered them was a glorious
death in the name of the cause!

377
00:26:30,824 --> 00:26:32,097
When I'm King...

378
00:26:33,226 --> 00:26:34,920
they will be well rewarded.

379
00:26:36,215 --> 00:26:39,422
You're going to leave me here?!
Tiernan!

380
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:42,800
I'm your brother! I'm your king!

381
00:26:42,961 --> 00:26:45,734
Chain him up
and throw him in there with Hood.

382
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,760
- They can die together.
- Tiernan?

383
00:26:53,298 --> 00:26:56,755
Tiernan, you come back here
and face me, boy!

384
00:26:57,355 --> 00:26:58,950
Save your breath.

385
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:07,219
My selfish greedy little brother.

386
00:27:08,365 --> 00:27:10,701
By the time he's bored
of this new game,

387
00:27:10,821 --> 00:27:14,080
he'll have ruined our last chance
to free Ireland.

388
00:27:16,164 --> 00:27:18,240
We should never have come here.

389
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:20,762
Our cause belongs to our people.

390
00:27:20,984 --> 00:27:24,984
Yours, yours have trouble
enough with this poisonous Sheriff.

391
00:27:26,914 --> 00:27:28,798
Perhaps we can be allies.

392
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:33,364
How did you?

393
00:27:34,325 --> 00:27:35,570
You helped me,

394
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:38,360
now I'll help you.

395
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:52,672
Kate,

396
00:27:53,501 --> 00:27:55,672
Kate, I've been so worried.

397
00:27:59,468 --> 00:28:00,480
Matthew.

398
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:08,293
I'm so sorry.

399
00:28:10,076 --> 00:28:11,680
Robin Hood tried to save him.

400
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,440
I hope Robin Hood gets hanged
from the highest gallows in Nottingham.

401
00:28:15,838 --> 00:28:19,400
- It won't bring Matthew back though.
- Robin Hood is an outlaw.

402
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:22,994
He just brings trouble.
They'll be back now, the Sheriff's men.

403
00:28:23,114 --> 00:28:25,240
Back to make examples
of the rest of us.

404
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,207
That doesn't mean we
should sit here and take it.

405
00:28:29,447 --> 00:28:31,400
That kind of talk is dangerous.

406
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:34,049
That's what's got
your brother killed!

407
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,983
<i>Come on, keep moving...</i>

408
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,211
What a glorious day

409
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,462
for an execution.

410
00:28:44,034 --> 00:28:46,022
It's a long march,
we need to leave now.

411
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:49,934
Yes, but surely we shall stay
to see the executions.

412
00:28:50,627 --> 00:28:51,627
No.

413
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,843
But it's Robin Hood and Finn.

414
00:28:55,222 --> 00:28:56,222
Sheriff,

415
00:28:57,733 --> 00:28:59,520
I will not watch my brother die.

416
00:29:00,514 --> 00:29:02,480
We leave now or the deal is off.

417
00:29:05,747 --> 00:29:06,880
Very well.

418
00:29:08,178 --> 00:29:09,472
This is my fault.

419
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:14,160
Matthew died
trying to save me from Gisborne.

420
00:29:14,841 --> 00:29:15,841
What?

421
00:29:19,431 --> 00:29:21,373
I went after Matthew alone,

422
00:29:22,352 --> 00:29:23,693
without thinking.

423
00:29:26,238 --> 00:29:29,080
I got Matthew killed.
If I hadn't been so stupid...

424
00:29:29,308 --> 00:29:32,531
No. Robin Hood killed your brother
with his talk of

425
00:29:32,651 --> 00:29:34,560
fighting for a better future.

426
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:37,080
You're wrong.

427
00:29:39,771 --> 00:29:43,771
These people believe in him.
And Matthew believed in him.

428
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:49,358
- That's good enough reason to help.
- Where are you going?

429
00:29:49,478 --> 00:29:51,771
Kate, Robin Hood's a criminal.

430
00:29:52,496 --> 00:29:55,346
Kate, please,
you'll end up like your brother.

431
00:29:58,072 --> 00:30:00,360
I'm not doing this for Robin Hood.

432
00:30:00,774 --> 00:30:02,474
I'm doing it for Matthew.

433
00:30:07,284 --> 00:30:08,560
I want to see Hood die.

434
00:30:10,316 --> 00:30:12,200
Have I not made myself clear?

435
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:14,720
No money
till the conscripts are at the coast.

436
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:18,000
- Patronage first. Hood later.
- I will have my way.

437
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,610
I'll watch him die and
bring his head to you on the road

438
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,522
and you can send it
with the money to Prince John.

439
00:30:28,324 --> 00:30:32,318
Yes.
Very good, Prince John would like that.

440
00:30:32,966 --> 00:30:35,716
He can show off his head
in his trophy room.

441
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,371
I may allow you to have your way

442
00:30:38,491 --> 00:30:41,141
but you can even think
of defying me again

443
00:30:41,624 --> 00:30:43,960
then it'll be your head
on its way to London.

444
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,680
Move out!

445
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:08,084
- Mice!
- Finn, leave him be!

446
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:11,400
- I hate mice.
- Help me shift this, come on.

447
00:31:13,253 --> 00:31:16,840
- It looks pretty solid to me.
- Well, let's find out, shall we?

448
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:21,373
I can feel a draft.

449
00:31:22,074 --> 00:31:23,079
Come on.

450
00:31:31,204 --> 00:31:32,975
The east gate's impossible.

451
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:35,760
- Too many guards.
- Same to the west.

452
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:38,600
- Storm the battlements?
- What?

453
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,177
I'm joking.

454
00:31:40,453 --> 00:31:41,463
Joking.

455
00:31:51,094 --> 00:31:53,742
I know it's my fault
Robin Hood was captured.

456
00:31:55,068 --> 00:31:59,068
So I want to help you save
the village men, this once.

457
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:03,851
I don't want Matthew
to have died for nothing.

458
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:07,104
Well, apparently you're the leader,
Tuck.

459
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:09,214
If it was me,

460
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:11,929
I reckon she's a good fighter.

461
00:32:12,421 --> 00:32:14,971
And she's got in the castle
once before.

462
00:32:19,132 --> 00:32:20,788
You take orders from me.

463
00:32:20,908 --> 00:32:23,140
Go in alone and we leave you behind.

464
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:34,080
Make sure the executioner
is prepared and have horses ready.

465
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,760
We join the Sheriff
immediately Robin Hood is dead.

466
00:32:44,373 --> 00:32:47,481
Drainage gutter.
That's our way out.

467
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:50,545
We're going to get out through here?
It's not possible!

468
00:32:57,256 --> 00:32:58,505
Open the door.

469
00:33:28,518 --> 00:33:29,635
Come on...

470
00:33:30,295 --> 00:33:31,308
COME ON!

471
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,320
They've escaped! You, wait there!

472
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:45,621
The rest of you search the castle.
Find them!

473
00:33:48,637 --> 00:33:51,863
Finn, I think this might be
our way out.

474
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:09,040
- Finn?
- What?

475
00:34:09,611 --> 00:34:11,252
We have a problem.

476
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,880
- Get me that chain.
- Why?

477
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:22,885
Just give me the chain!

478
00:34:35,442 --> 00:34:36,656
Grab my feet.

479
00:35:33,996 --> 00:35:35,337
- Robin!
<i>- Much!</i>

480
00:35:39,945 --> 00:35:41,443
There! Get them!

481
00:36:01,587 --> 00:36:02,616
With me.

482
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:04,422
Hold this.

483
00:36:06,904 --> 00:36:09,280
- Are you sure about this?
- I hope so.

484
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:14,882
Ready?

485
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:16,439
Now!

486
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,360
Hood!!!

487
00:36:23,503 --> 00:36:24,532
Hood!!!

488
00:36:27,832 --> 00:36:30,167
Hey Robin, we're flying!

489
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,200
John, grab the sides!

490
00:36:54,055 --> 00:36:57,520
- Where's the men from the village?
- On the road. We have horses.

491
00:36:57,761 --> 00:37:00,000
- You came back?
- To save the village men.

492
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,960
- If that means helping you first...
- I'm glad you did. Come on!

493
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:15,480
Hood and Finn have escaped! They're
after you. I've more men on the way.

494
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:17,571
You let my brother get out?

495
00:37:17,691 --> 00:37:19,960
He won't rest
until he's hunted me down!

496
00:37:20,609 --> 00:37:22,135
We're under attack!

497
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:26,640
It's Hood! Take cover!

498
00:37:33,148 --> 00:37:35,748
Quickly, you two.
Get the money, come on.

499
00:37:37,336 --> 00:37:40,365
Where's he going with my money?
Get after him, Gisborne!

500
00:37:48,819 --> 00:37:52,680
They're everywhere!
Pull back, wait for reinforcements!

501
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:53,921
Move!

502
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:57,880
Much, Allan, keep the Sheriff
and Gisborne pinned down.

503
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,450
The rest of us after Tiernan,
come on.

504
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,746
Come on, come on, quick, go, go.

505
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:05,681
Into the forest men, come on.

506
00:38:07,761 --> 00:38:09,080
Come on, hurry up!

507
00:38:13,213 --> 00:38:14,924
Sure, you're already dead.

508
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,657
I'll take my leave of you,
Robin Hood.

509
00:38:21,371 --> 00:38:22,728
When I'm King

510
00:38:23,188 --> 00:38:24,198
of Ireland

511
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,360
there'll always be room
at my court for you.

512
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:30,633
That's all right.
We've got our own fight here.

513
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:34,760
- What about your brother?
- He's no brother of mine.

514
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,706
Not any more,

515
00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:39,143
but he'll get a fair trial.

516
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:42,720
- Come on John, give the man his money!
- Ach sure,

517
00:38:43,566 --> 00:38:45,427
I don't really need it all.

518
00:38:47,438 --> 00:38:50,160
For your men and for their families.

519
00:38:51,956 --> 00:38:53,960
Plenty left to raise an army.

520
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:56,429
A small group of
highly committed men

521
00:38:57,494 --> 00:38:59,894
is worth more
than an army of slaves.

522
00:39:00,245 --> 00:39:02,118
Well, good luck my friend.

523
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,520
And spend the money wisely,

524
00:39:06,898 --> 00:39:07,898
we will.

525
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,319
Ah. Prince John's escort.

526
00:39:25,862 --> 00:39:27,912
They want their money Gisborne.

527
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:29,795
- So what do we do?
- We?

528
00:39:31,556 --> 00:39:33,960
Do you think that I'm going
to be responsible for your

529
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,543
arrogance
and your incompetence again?

530
00:39:37,574 --> 00:39:39,440
You can't be serious? Put it down.

531
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,785
No, Gisborne.
This time YOU pay my dues.

532
00:39:43,184 --> 00:39:44,560
Gentlemen, good to see you.

533
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:48,360
Very smart, lovely colours,
tight fitting uniform, excellent.

534
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,967
Slight change of plan,

535
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:52,360
- there is no patronage money.
- What?

536
00:39:52,773 --> 00:39:54,200
But Gisborne has volunteered

537
00:39:54,361 --> 00:39:56,880
to go with you to explain
why not to Prince John. Personally.

538
00:39:57,371 --> 00:39:59,840
No, my Lord, please!
This means certain death.

539
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:01,040
Get off me!

540
00:40:02,995 --> 00:40:06,856
Well, you never know. You might
catch Prince John in a good mood.

541
00:40:07,648 --> 00:40:09,000
He's all yours.

542
00:40:09,334 --> 00:40:11,120
I won't forget this.

543
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:13,160
I'll be back for you.

544
00:40:14,482 --> 00:40:15,482
Get off!

545
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:17,560
Get off me!

546
00:40:28,212 --> 00:40:31,370
One at a time gents.
All right? You'll all get some.

547
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:35,166
Kate...

548
00:40:36,538 --> 00:40:37,538
Kate.

549
00:40:41,284 --> 00:40:43,134
I just wanted to thank you.

550
00:40:44,271 --> 00:40:46,142
And I'm so sorry for your brother.

551
00:40:46,262 --> 00:40:50,012
- If I could change anything...
- I said I'd help you this once.

552
00:40:50,334 --> 00:40:51,821
But my brother's dead

553
00:40:52,822 --> 00:40:56,240
and people will go on dying while you
give them false hopes of a better life.

554
00:40:56,404 --> 00:40:57,560
Kate, wait.

555
00:41:00,161 --> 00:41:02,374
I mean to make those hopes real.

556
00:41:03,632 --> 00:41:05,320
It's too late for Matthew.

557
00:41:08,337 --> 00:41:11,728
Well, I've paid my debt
for turning you in, for his sake.

558
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,320
I don't ever want to see you again.

559
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:22,801
Is that Kate?

560
00:41:24,492 --> 00:41:27,655
- Where's she going?
- She's going home to her family.

561
00:41:30,229 --> 00:41:31,629
I've let her down.

562
00:41:32,095 --> 00:41:34,440
You can't expect to
win over every mind,

563
00:41:34,853 --> 00:41:36,506
or a heart so full of sorrow.

564
00:41:36,626 --> 00:41:37,944
Let her grieve.

565
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:41,680
That grief will turn to anger
and then she'll be ready to fight.

566
00:41:44,037 --> 00:41:47,200
Just as these men here
are ready to fight.

567
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:52,560
This is the core of our army.
All they need is a leader.

568
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,406
My friends...

569
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:08,040
... lie low here until it's
safe to return to your villages.

570
00:42:08,497 --> 00:42:11,440
You're marked men.
But I swear to you,

571
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:15,049
that brand you wear will
one day become a badge of honour.

572
00:42:16,388 --> 00:42:18,148
And believe me when I say

573
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:21,851
that the day is coming when this Sheriff
will be held to account

574
00:42:21,971 --> 00:42:24,482
for what he's done to you
and your villages.

575
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,735
And on that day

576
00:42:27,001 --> 00:42:29,320
my men and I will call on you.

577
00:42:30,025 --> 00:42:32,160
We will call on your strength.

578
00:42:32,863 --> 00:42:34,897
We will call on your courage.

579
00:42:35,826 --> 00:42:39,760
We will call on the love you bear
your families to stand with us and fight

580
00:42:40,786 --> 00:42:44,000
and overthrow the cruel
injustice that infects this land.

581
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,260
- Are you with me?
- Yes!

582
00:42:58,287 --> 00:43:01,200
The Abbot has damned
our souls forever!

583
00:43:01,606 --> 00:43:04,720
We have to confront the Abbot right now!
We need to understand why he did this.

584
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:08,160
There are things going on here
of such magnitude...

585
00:43:08,401 --> 00:43:11,440
... as to be beyond
your understanding.

586
00:43:11,681 --> 00:43:13,640
Heretics. Devils.
I trusted you.

587
00:43:14,778 --> 00:43:17,360
That is why Hood
must burn at the stake!

588
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,542
Burn them!

589
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:21,640
The choices we make at these
moments define us for eternity.

590
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,150
I'm burning them!
