1
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,440
Isabella,

2
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,318
if I wanted to kill you,
you'd be already dead.

3
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,788
What do you want?

4
00:00:23,204 --> 00:00:25,320
I want to know why you've done
a deal with the devil.

5
00:00:25,862 --> 00:00:27,240
Why do you care?

6
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:29,160
The Prince... is evil.

7
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:33,045
It's not every day
a prince asks you to be Sheriff.

8
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:34,920
Especially if you're a woman.

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,880
- You'll be working with a traitor.
- No. I'm working for myself.

10
00:00:39,436 --> 00:00:42,720
I intend to be the best Sheriff
Nottingham has ever seen.

11
00:00:44,393 --> 00:00:46,375
And you'll see
for yourself tomorrow.

12
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:47,495
No.

13
00:00:48,122 --> 00:00:51,022
It'll never work,
because the Prince will fall.

14
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:53,640
And you will fall...

15
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:55,520
- unless...
- What?

16
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:58,049
Unless you work with me,

17
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:02,057
keep me in the picture,
tell me the Prince's plans

18
00:01:02,406 --> 00:01:04,400
and I'll protect you
when the King returns.

19
00:01:08,362 --> 00:01:10,021
What if I don't want
to be your friend?

20
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:12,960
Then you'll find out
what it is to be my enemy.

21
00:01:13,413 --> 00:01:15,480
Are you threatening me, Robin Hood?

22
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:18,640
I could destroy you
whenever I choose.

23
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:20,240
So what's stopping you?

24
00:01:21,952 --> 00:01:23,281
Guards!

25
00:01:30,222 --> 00:01:32,122
You think it over, Isabella.

26
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:34,960
The offer's open, but not for ever.

27
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,366
It's Robin Hood.
Well, sound the alarm!

28
00:01:44,486 --> 00:01:46,720
<i>Quick! Stop him! Guard the exit!</i>

29
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:08,795
I swear...

30
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:13,960
<i>Find Hood! I want every corner
of Nottingham searched!</i>

31
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,192
Trouble, Isabella?

32
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,320
<i>Guards!</i>

33
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,480
You haven't seen anything yet!

34
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,760
The Sub Wood Team

35
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,600
Episode nine
A DANGEROUS DEAL

36
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:10,262
- This should be interesting.
- Well, not that interesting.

37
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,398
What exactly are we doing here?

38
00:03:12,518 --> 00:03:15,650
Robin thinks he can charm our new
Sheriff into working with outlaws.

39
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,668
Look, let's just see
what she's made of, shall we?

40
00:03:18,788 --> 00:03:21,800
Well, it's not sugar and spice
and all things nice.

41
00:03:24,388 --> 00:03:25,588
<i>Meg Bennett...</i>

42
00:03:26,243 --> 00:03:30,200
the Sheriff's Court has heard
of your disobedience to your father...

43
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:33,800
and your refusal to accept
any suitors he chose for you.

44
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:37,893
Lady Sheriff, one was a drunken sot,
the second looked like a donkey,

45
00:03:38,013 --> 00:03:40,480
the third was a halfwit
with the brains of a tree!

46
00:03:40,641 --> 00:03:42,760
- You little wretch...
- Please!

47
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:47,480
And the fourth, you apparently
bribed to go back to York

48
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:49,691
with money you stole
from your father.

49
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:52,311
He was a mummy's boy!
What use is that?

50
00:03:53,078 --> 00:03:57,040
Meg, tell the court why you acted
in such a deplorable fashion.

51
00:03:57,241 --> 00:04:00,400
Because I won't accept anyone
telling me how to live my own life.

52
00:04:01,112 --> 00:04:03,987
I don't want to marry! Men are so...

53
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,720
stupid!

54
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
Quiet!

55
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,840
I think England would be a much better
place, if women were in charge.

56
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:14,559
Dream on, girl.

57
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:17,680
- Untie her.
- What?

58
00:04:17,998 --> 00:04:18,998
Thank you!

59
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,610
People of Nottingham...

60
00:04:23,954 --> 00:04:27,143
... now maybe you can see
the kind of Sheriff I am.

61
00:04:27,903 --> 00:04:30,224
And as I've set Meg here free,

62
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:35,431
I intend to set the whole
of Nottingham free...

63
00:04:38,046 --> 00:04:39,564
to be a fairer...

64
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:43,036
more peaceful and prosperous
place for us all!

65
00:04:46,564 --> 00:04:49,064
You are far too bright
to be locked up.

66
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,730
I think I need people
like you around me.

67
00:04:56,571 --> 00:04:59,826
The last regime
was brutal and corrupt.

68
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:03,913
And in recognition of crimes
committed against the people,

69
00:05:04,842 --> 00:05:05,892
my brother,

70
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:08,226
Guy of Gisborne,

71
00:05:08,665 --> 00:05:11,730
shall be executed here
on Thursday at midday.

72
00:05:12,027 --> 00:05:14,320
See? Maybe we can work with her.

73
00:05:14,726 --> 00:05:16,239
Yeah... We'll see.

74
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:20,586
Bravo!

75
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,430
Isn't she marvellous?

76
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,680
How I've missed you.

77
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,830
My lovely wife!

78
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:32,515
Get off me.

79
00:05:34,137 --> 00:05:35,832
I'm your new Sheriff.

80
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:39,066
Thornton at your service.

81
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:43,360
<i>I'm sure you'll understand that my wife
now has me to care for, leaving me</i>

82
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:44,960
to care for you.

83
00:05:45,517 --> 00:05:48,600
Rest assured you are
in firm and capable hands.

84
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,200
Now, if you'll excuse me,

85
00:05:52,609 --> 00:05:55,480
the little wife and I
have some catching up to do.

86
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,440
There'll be no deal with Thornton.

87
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:04,651
We should get going. The villagers
will be expecting a food drop.

88
00:06:04,771 --> 00:06:06,280
I know. You go.

89
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,755
I need to stay here
and find out his next move.

90
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,806
Fine. I'm staying too.

91
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,287
No, it's all right, Much. You go.

92
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:15,608
- I'll stay.
- Go on.

93
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:25,090
You ran away! You deserted me!

94
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:28,920
I loved you, cared for you.

95
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:33,240
- We were so happy together.
- How can you say that?

96
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:39,775
<i>Guards!</i>

97
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:40,800
No!

98
00:06:41,383 --> 00:06:43,440
Take him, he's attacking
your Sheriff!

99
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,450
That's enough, let her go.

100
00:06:46,802 --> 00:06:47,940
{\Take him }To the dungeons!

101
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,659
Do you want Prince John to know
he has a criminal for a Sheriff?

102
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:54,202
- He appointed me. He trusts me.
- You abandoned your husband,

103
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:56,160
broke man's law and God's.

104
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:01,600
{\Now, }My men will ride to him at nightfall
if they receive no word of my safety.

105
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:05,519
Release me or it's over.

106
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:14,040
Let him go.

107
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:29,080
And now it's time
I taught you some respect.

108
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:34,699
Stop it, please!

109
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:37,200
If you promise not to hurt her,
I can make you rich.

110
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:38,880
- Away with her.
- It's true.

111
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,969
I know where gold coins are buried.
Handfuls and handfuls.

112
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,559
- Where?
- There's a mound...

113
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:50,525
near Dead Man's Crossing,
in the forest.

114
00:07:50,645 --> 00:07:52,045
I think I know it.

115
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:54,803
If you've told a lie,

116
00:07:55,346 --> 00:07:56,796
it'll be your last.

117
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,800
Lock her up.

118
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:03,240
Listen. I won't rest
until you're free.

119
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:05,987
Look at them, boys.

120
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,210
The ladies are getting
a little emotional.

121
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,861
You stay strong.

122
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:17,215
Get off me!

123
00:08:17,972 --> 00:08:20,510
- Thornton's dangerous.
- For Isabella, maybe.

124
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:24,630
- No, for Nottingham, for everyone.
- Whereas your Isabella's an angel.

125
00:08:25,162 --> 00:08:27,520
I just think we can work
together with her, unlike him.

126
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,329
- You are so wrong.
- I'm not wrong!

127
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:31,066
- Can't you see?
- See what?

128
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:33,068
Can't you see her
for what she really is?

129
00:08:33,188 --> 00:08:35,200
Kate, why are you so angry with me?

130
00:08:53,563 --> 00:08:56,013
Right... well...
I should probably go.

131
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,850
Get off me!

132
00:09:06,215 --> 00:09:07,215
Let go!

133
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,558
I'll make you pay for this,
you rancid brutes!

134
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:20,560
Men! If I had my way,
they'd all disappear

135
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:24,171
in a puff of smoke and the world
would be a happier place.

136
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,420
What are you staring at?

137
00:09:29,364 --> 00:09:30,480
I know you.

138
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:34,145
You're him, aren't you?
Isabella's brother?

139
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,944
- She's a friend of mine.
- Not that close, obviously.

140
00:09:39,064 --> 00:09:41,200
Her nasty husband
did this to me, clever.

141
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:42,491
Thornton?

142
00:09:44,088 --> 00:09:45,138
Is he here?

143
00:09:47,063 --> 00:09:48,240
She's terrified of him.

144
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:50,794
She shouldn't have left him,
then, should she?

145
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:53,240
You always were a bit
pleased with yourself.

146
00:09:54,455 --> 00:09:55,838
I saw you once.

147
00:09:56,948 --> 00:09:59,480
The man in black on his black horse.

148
00:09:59,973 --> 00:10:01,400
The big "I am".

149
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,160
Look at you now.

150
00:10:06,226 --> 00:10:07,826
Dirty and miserable...

151
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:09,681
and small!

152
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:13,920
And now you're going to be executed.

153
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:16,360
By the look of it,
you might not be far behind.

154
00:10:19,293 --> 00:10:20,893
I hope you go to hell!

155
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,080
I'm already there.

156
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:56,891
This is it.

157
00:11:00,783 --> 00:11:02,083
Get going, then.

158
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,312
- You expect...
- Don't you understand?

159
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:10,048
Every time you cross me,
every little word or action,

160
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:13,387
you make it worse for yourself
when I get you on my own...

161
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,999
in a small, dark room.

162
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:19,904
Now go on.

163
00:11:21,738 --> 00:11:23,120
Prove you love me.

164
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:24,859
Get digging.

165
00:11:42,883 --> 00:11:45,983
If this is a wild goose chase,
I'll kill that girl.

166
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:08,691
Look.

167
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,178
Let me see.

168
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,800
You, get some more men.
You, what are you waiting for?

169
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,020
Get digging!

170
00:12:30,342 --> 00:12:32,342
<i>Well, come on, get on with it.</i>

171
00:12:32,857 --> 00:12:35,416
<i>No, no, not there, you idiots!</i>

172
00:12:35,536 --> 00:12:38,040
- He really is a pig, isn't he?
- Yep.

173
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:41,676
At last there's something
you and Isabella agree on.

174
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Listen...

175
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:49,071
- about what happened earlier...
- I know.

176
00:12:49,657 --> 00:12:50,657
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:52,600
What for?

178
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,408
It's difficult. Isn't it?

179
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,140
Is it?

180
00:13:00,421 --> 00:13:03,371
- Why, because of Isabella?
- No, not because...

181
00:13:05,728 --> 00:13:07,528
It's just the way we live.

182
00:13:08,114 --> 00:13:09,307
You know...

183
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:13,100
- and then there's Much.
- Much?

184
00:13:13,681 --> 00:13:17,281
<i>Right, you lot, I want the treasure
out of here by nightfall.</i>

185
00:13:18,226 --> 00:13:20,219
I'd best get the others.

186
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:28,599
What?

187
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,520
Just look after yourself.

188
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,480
Yeah.

189
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:34,714
Yeah, you too.

190
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,105
Just leave it, will you?

191
00:13:44,136 --> 00:13:45,280
It hurts!

192
00:13:47,512 --> 00:13:49,862
That's why they do it.
Deal with it.

193
00:13:52,804 --> 00:13:55,904
- I'm thirsty.
- {\Well, then}Save your breath and stop whining.

194
00:13:56,206 --> 00:13:58,306
Nasty piece of work, aren't you?

195
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:00,779
No wonder Isabella wants you dead.

196
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:05,440
- What did you do to her, anyway?
- Give me strength!

197
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:08,600
It's almost worth dying
to be spared your endless chatter.

198
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,770
Come on. You're here, I'm here.

199
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:13,591
What else are we going to do?

200
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:19,686
I found her a husband,
that's what I did.

201
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,189
Good price, too.

202
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:27,248
You sold her?! Your own sister?

203
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:30,200
It was her best chance in life. Not
my fault she went and made a mess of it.

204
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,096
Well, of course it is. All of it.
You sold her to a monster!

205
00:14:33,216 --> 00:14:36,480
You stupid girl.
You know nothing about it.

206
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,406
I'm not "stupid girl".

207
00:14:39,022 --> 00:14:40,022
I'm Meg.

208
00:14:41,122 --> 00:14:42,600
And I'm still thirsty.

209
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:46,959
That stone around your neck.

210
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,793
Suck it.

211
00:14:49,918 --> 00:14:51,640
It'll make your mouth water.

212
00:15:04,481 --> 00:15:07,080
Burial mound.
Danish, by the look of it.

213
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:11,325
They placed curses on horses' heads
to ward off intruders.

214
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:20,011
What are you doing?

215
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:43,824
Get a grip.
It's just a horse's head.

216
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:46,480
Golden bridle. Nice.

217
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:48,952
I'd say that's a chief's.

218
00:15:49,218 --> 00:15:52,720
It's the treasure. They bury it with
them for the long journey to Valhalla.

219
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:55,200
Where is that?
It's near Norwich, isn't it?

220
00:15:55,923 --> 00:15:58,473
No, Allan, Valhalla
is Norse for heaven.

221
00:16:03,557 --> 00:16:04,957
My beautiful wife.

222
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:12,744
What's going on
in that pretty little head of yours?

223
00:16:13,187 --> 00:16:14,437
Nothing at all.

224
00:16:16,128 --> 00:16:17,400
Just the way you like it.

225
00:16:22,288 --> 00:16:23,788
What have you taken?

226
00:16:25,162 --> 00:16:27,236
Steal from me, would you?

227
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:30,838
He was just looking!

228
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,899
Let that be a lesson to you all!

229
00:16:37,515 --> 00:16:38,975
Now get the cart!

230
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,040
The sooner the gold's back
in Nottingham, the better.

231
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,440
Right. We get rid of him.

232
00:16:46,746 --> 00:16:48,400
Let's take his gold first.

233
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:50,265
And make Isabella Sheriff again?

234
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:53,520
Sheriff! We'll have a donkey
for Archbishop next.

235
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,520
Kate, I want you to stay and watch
the hoard. Much, you too.

236
00:16:57,681 --> 00:17:00,131
The rest of you come with me.
Come on.

237
00:17:04,295 --> 00:17:06,145
<i>Hey, you, stop there! Stop.</i>

238
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,880
<i>Stop, I say!</i>

239
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,620
You're on my land.

240
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,960
Well, you pay me a toll,
I guess we might forget about it.

241
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,960
That's not very nice, now, is it?

242
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:27,958
Are you scared?

243
00:17:28,823 --> 00:17:29,823
What of?

244
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,120
"What of?"

245
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,320
Your date with the executioner.

246
00:17:36,592 --> 00:17:37,720
Do I look scared?

247
00:17:40,106 --> 00:17:41,120
Actually, no.

248
00:17:42,582 --> 00:17:45,800
Terrible, yes. One out of ten
for personal appearance,

249
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:48,160
but not frightened.

250
00:17:49,888 --> 00:17:51,438
I'm almost impressed.

251
00:17:53,904 --> 00:17:56,504
It's as if you've got
a clear conscience.

252
00:17:58,717 --> 00:18:00,387
Well, why shouldn't I have?

253
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:03,240
Because of all the awful things
you've done in your life.

254
00:18:03,689 --> 00:18:05,135
I mean, no one...

255
00:18:05,656 --> 00:18:08,480
actually seems sorry that you're
on the way out, do they?

256
00:18:09,407 --> 00:18:11,257
Does that not make you sad?

257
00:18:12,396 --> 00:18:14,796
I can't help
what people think of me.

258
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,120
What's done is done.

259
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:20,200
And if I am to die, then so be it.

260
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,320
Is your life really that empty that you
don't care whether you live or die?

261
00:18:35,317 --> 00:18:36,560
I'm starving.

262
00:18:57,852 --> 00:18:58,852
Here.

263
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,407
Keep your strength up.

264
00:19:09,532 --> 00:19:11,782
There must be some good in you yet.

265
00:19:13,306 --> 00:19:14,706
You don't know me.

266
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Besides,

267
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:22,144
I thought you hated men.

268
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:24,644
I do.

269
00:19:27,575 --> 00:19:28,575
I do.

270
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:36,116
<i>Start loading the gold now
onto the cart!</i>

271
00:19:36,236 --> 00:19:38,280
- Much!
- What?

272
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:40,839
Can I talk to you about something?

273
00:19:43,595 --> 00:19:45,080
I really like Robin.

274
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,380
And I think he likes me.

275
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:54,491
But he won't let anything happen,
maybe because of you.

276
00:19:55,677 --> 00:19:57,480
Would you talk to him for me?

277
00:19:58,404 --> 00:20:00,554
Tell him that we're just friends?

278
00:20:03,032 --> 00:20:04,035
Yeah,

279
00:20:04,754 --> 00:20:05,759
of course.

280
00:20:06,937 --> 00:20:07,960
Thanks.

281
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:11,765
Right. We're almost ready.

282
00:20:12,606 --> 00:20:15,591
Much, when the cart's ready,
I want you to get it out of there.

283
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:17,420
All right? Good luck.

284
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:33,699
Thanks, my friend.

285
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,520
I shall enjoy spending
your ill-gotten gains!

286
00:20:36,681 --> 00:20:38,720
Be careful. Might come back
to haunt you.

287
00:20:39,737 --> 00:20:42,120
You're the one who's living
a nightmare, precious.

288
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:45,699
That's it. We're done.

289
00:20:50,445 --> 00:20:51,480
Start loading!

290
00:20:52,587 --> 00:20:54,437
<i>Right, let's get it loaded.</i>

291
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,840
Isn't this my lucky day?

292
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:10,160
My first day as Sheriff
and untold riches fall into my lap!

293
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,294
Luck can easily change.

294
00:21:17,161 --> 00:21:18,561
<i>Right, let's go...</i>

295
00:21:19,449 --> 00:21:22,049
This hoard isn't yours to take,
Thornton.

296
00:21:22,403 --> 00:21:24,120
And who's going to stop me?

297
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:25,331
Robin Hood!

298
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:32,600
Isabella, I haven't finished
with you yet!

299
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,840
Get back!

300
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,840
You lot, with me. The rest,
get the cart out of here!

301
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,131
Much, the cart!

302
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:50,080
<i>I really like Robin...</i>

303
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,080
<i>and I think he likes me.</i>

304
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,800
- Get after them!
- Much!

305
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:16,852
Isabella!

306
00:22:18,517 --> 00:22:19,574
Isabella!

307
00:22:24,104 --> 00:22:25,343
Wait! Wait!

308
00:22:25,463 --> 00:22:27,013
- Much!
- I'm sorry.

309
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:30,080
We haven't got time for this.
We have to find Thornton.

310
00:22:33,737 --> 00:22:36,920
- There's something I have to tell you.
- What are you talking about?

311
00:22:39,517 --> 00:22:41,256
Come on, we have to go!

312
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,780
Robin.

313
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:22,359
Oh, thank God...

314
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:30,320
Are you all right?

315
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,670
I was a fool to turn my back on you.
Please help me.

316
00:23:36,872 --> 00:23:40,440
If you promise to fight with us for
King Richard, then I'll protect you.

317
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,949
Yes. Of course.

318
00:23:43,995 --> 00:23:45,455
You and me, Robin.

319
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,520
I think we can work together.

320
00:23:50,236 --> 00:23:52,200
I've always known it
and I think you do too.

321
00:23:54,991 --> 00:23:57,480
- It's a deal.
- You won't regret this.

322
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:00,562
How can I repay you?

323
00:24:00,682 --> 00:24:02,800
Well, you can start
by handing over the gold

324
00:24:03,168 --> 00:24:04,640
tomorrow at Knight's Glade.

325
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,832
Of course, you must
give it back to the people.

326
00:24:06,952 --> 00:24:09,152
- It's theirs, after all.
- Good.

327
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,640
Isabella, you'll suffer for this!

328
00:24:12,912 --> 00:24:13,991
Isabella!

329
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:17,640
John, escort the Sheriff
back to her castle.

330
00:24:18,796 --> 00:24:20,701
- Thank you.
- This way.

331
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:28,638
She always manages to get
what she wants.

332
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:31,264
Kate, just leave it, please.

333
00:24:40,305 --> 00:24:41,440
Isabella!

334
00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:52,189
I don't like this. You shouldn't
have touched that burial mound.

335
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:53,520
Superstitious peasant!

336
00:24:58,494 --> 00:25:00,005
They're just bats.

337
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:04,179
Get back here, you cowards!

338
00:25:14,523 --> 00:25:16,517
You have disturbed the dead.

339
00:25:18,468 --> 00:25:19,920
<i>Somebody help me...</i>

340
00:25:20,348 --> 00:25:21,452
Come back!

341
00:25:22,182 --> 00:25:23,920
You invoked the Viking curse

342
00:25:24,612 --> 00:25:28,120
to be visited by suffering,
madness and death!

343
00:25:28,784 --> 00:25:30,434
Playing with the devil.

344
00:25:33,329 --> 00:25:34,929
Big mistake, Thornton.

345
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:40,103
You don't say much, do you?

346
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:42,188
Robin sees you as an ally.

347
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:45,080
- Strictly business.
- Typical man.

348
00:25:45,508 --> 00:25:49,099
There's nothing ever strictly
business between a man and a woman.

349
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:52,680
If he has done a deal with you, it's for
the good of the cause, nothing else.

350
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,479
- How can you be so sure?
- Because I know Robin.

351
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,349
My guess is if he's got eyes
for anyone, it's for Kate, not you.

352
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,320
We found him in the forest babbling
something about Viking ghosts.

353
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:09,320
He needs to be locked up.

354
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,520
Yep.
Madhouse is the best place for him.

355
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,740
He's a danger to himself
and the people around him.

356
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,807
If he mentions something
about being Sheriff of Nottingham,

357
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:21,277
pay no attention.

358
00:26:23,072 --> 00:26:24,760
He was the Queen of Sheba last week.

359
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,800
Nottingham's well rid of you,
Thornton.

360
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,719
And don't even think of coming back.

361
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:36,389
Because if you do, your next
destination won't be an asylum,

362
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:38,497
but where you really belong.

363
00:26:38,717 --> 00:26:39,723
Hell.

364
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:49,038
Release her.

365
00:26:49,989 --> 00:26:52,600
Isabella, you're back!
Thank goodness.

366
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,868
I'm not sure my brother will feel
the same. Come on, let's go.

367
00:26:55,988 --> 00:26:57,720
Won't you release Guy too?

368
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,920
What? Are you mad? He's our enemy!

369
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,777
But... You see?

370
00:27:02,481 --> 00:27:04,681
Do you see how they manipulate us?

371
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:06,972
A few hours in a cell with a...

372
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,760
cold-hearted killer
and even you lose your wits.

373
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,880
That's the poison of men, Meg.

374
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:13,640
None of them can be trusted.

375
00:27:14,352 --> 00:27:17,152
My brother will get
exactly what he deserves.

376
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:18,389
Now come on.

377
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,250
Thank you, but no...

378
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:41,366
You must eat.

379
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
For me.

380
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:47,574
The least I can do.

381
00:28:48,034 --> 00:28:49,984
You've done more than enough.

382
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,160
- I haven't done anything.
- You have.

383
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,488
You've made me think.

384
00:28:57,423 --> 00:28:58,477
About what?

385
00:28:59,561 --> 00:29:01,646
About someone I used to know.

386
00:29:04,228 --> 00:29:06,428
She saw good where there was none.

387
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,760
She made me a better man.

388
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:13,059
What happened?

389
00:29:16,841 --> 00:29:18,158
I destroyed her.

390
00:29:20,101 --> 00:29:21,440
I destroyed everything.

391
00:29:26,268 --> 00:29:27,277
Go on.

392
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,430
I want some guards behind me
and I want the rest of them hidden.

393
00:29:40,643 --> 00:29:42,675
Understood? Good.

394
00:29:50,094 --> 00:29:53,753
"Sire, I write to you

395
00:29:54,612 --> 00:29:56,468
"with a grave confession

396
00:29:57,905 --> 00:30:01,359
"that I hope you will find
in your heart to forgive.

397
00:30:06,403 --> 00:30:08,150
"By way of an apology,

398
00:30:08,786 --> 00:30:12,329
"I would like to offer you...
a gift."

399
00:30:27,062 --> 00:30:28,062
Meg?

400
00:30:31,165 --> 00:30:34,217
- What are you doing?
- I can't let her kill you. I can't.

401
00:30:34,337 --> 00:30:35,887
You'd do this for me?

402
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:41,466
Thank you.

403
00:30:44,383 --> 00:30:46,852
- Well, this is touching!
- Go!

404
00:30:47,357 --> 00:30:50,161
- Guards!
- She didn't know what she was doing.

405
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,732
Oh, yes, she did. How could you?

406
00:30:53,804 --> 00:30:55,886
I set you free
and this is how you repay me?

407
00:30:56,006 --> 00:30:58,197
We're not the same.
I try to do things out of love.

408
00:30:58,317 --> 00:31:01,317
- You're doing this out of hate!
- How dare you?!

409
00:31:02,165 --> 00:31:04,215
I suppose I should be grateful.

410
00:31:04,857 --> 00:31:08,280
Now I know the only person
I can trust is myself. I'm on my own.

411
00:31:08,512 --> 00:31:12,280
- You put yourself there, Isabella.
- I could say the same for you.

412
00:31:14,378 --> 00:31:17,040
And if you two love birds
want to be together,

413
00:31:17,587 --> 00:31:19,517
that's fine. You shall.

414
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:22,600
You'll both die.

415
00:31:26,265 --> 00:31:29,955
Come on, we don't want to be late
for Knight's Glade. Where's Much?

416
00:31:30,075 --> 00:31:32,575
Probably attempting to catch
breakfast.

417
00:31:32,742 --> 00:31:34,640
Kate, are you all right?

418
00:31:35,866 --> 00:31:36,866
Fine.

419
00:31:37,485 --> 00:31:38,680
Let's just go.

420
00:31:39,146 --> 00:31:40,960
You don't want to be late
for Isabella.

421
00:31:41,121 --> 00:31:44,493
This is for the good of everyone.
If we can get a Sheriff working...

422
00:31:44,613 --> 00:31:46,680
- Yeah, I know.
- Will you listen to me?

423
00:31:48,048 --> 00:31:50,658
When we get back, I think we need
to sort a few things out.

424
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:51,778
Robin...

425
00:31:52,722 --> 00:31:54,572
... there's really no need.

426
00:31:54,987 --> 00:31:56,840
She's obviously your priority.

427
00:32:03,136 --> 00:32:07,136
She's worth more than any treasure.
Don't let her slip through your fingers.

428
00:32:56,126 --> 00:32:57,360
You came, then.

429
00:32:58,496 --> 00:32:59,575
I am glad.

430
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:03,824
Of course. We had a deal,
you and me. Remember?

431
00:33:03,944 --> 00:33:06,560
- I do remember.
- Working together.

432
00:33:06,872 --> 00:33:08,276
For the good of Nottingham.

433
00:33:08,396 --> 00:33:10,837
Absolutely. That's all
that matters now, isn't it?

434
00:33:10,957 --> 00:33:12,957
Please take it. You earned it.

435
00:33:15,016 --> 00:33:17,416
You were my knight
in shining armour.

436
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:19,360
Yeah, that's me.

437
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:27,221
Robin!

438
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,440
Life's full of disappointment,
isn't it?

439
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:46,329
Now I've decided
to stand on my own two feet.

440
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,550
I thought about what you said.

441
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,030
Obey your every command,
do whatever you say.

442
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:54,114
- I offered you friendship.
- No, you threatened me.

443
00:33:54,234 --> 00:33:56,784
I won't be some frightened
little woman.

444
00:33:57,073 --> 00:33:58,480
Go on! Take them!

445
00:34:02,002 --> 00:34:04,960
- Well, it looks like you were right.
- I usually am.

446
00:34:05,297 --> 00:34:08,840
- Next time you might just listen.
- If there is a next time.

447
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,598
Robin!

448
00:34:19,385 --> 00:34:20,477
Come on!

449
00:34:28,001 --> 00:34:30,389
- Kate, come on!
- Get them!

450
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:32,092
Kate!

451
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:46,280
{\pos(192,220)}
So where did you go, then?

452
00:34:46,697 --> 00:34:47,890
Er, nowhere.

453
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:51,122
I just wanted to be alone,
that's all.

454
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:54,027
Hey, come on. You can tell me.

455
00:34:54,857 --> 00:34:57,599
You weren't leaving, were you? Much?

456
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:02,280
- Where did you spring up from, eh?
- Er...

457
00:35:04,138 --> 00:35:05,538
Are you all right?

458
00:35:05,922 --> 00:35:07,789
Yeah, I'm fine.

459
00:35:08,641 --> 00:35:10,291
Robin, what's the plan?

460
00:35:11,106 --> 00:35:14,383
We're going to take
that hoard back, today.

461
00:35:14,761 --> 00:35:18,480
- What about Gisborne's execution?
- Well, that's the perfect distraction.

462
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,184
We'll make our move when
everybody's looking to the platform.

463
00:35:44,304 --> 00:35:46,108
When he comes out, we slip inside.

464
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:49,480
Allan, Tuck, go through the armoury.
John, through the kitchens with Much.

465
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:53,760
Kate, you come with me to the west
gate. We'll go from there. Go on.

466
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,760
Bring out the prisoners.

467
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,223
The girl.

468
00:36:18,491 --> 00:36:21,679
- I'm scared.
- When it comes, it'll be very quick.

469
00:36:27,302 --> 00:36:28,799
Come on, this way.

470
00:36:37,168 --> 00:36:40,117
As you all know
from bitter experience,

471
00:36:40,237 --> 00:36:43,040
Guy of Gisborne
is an enemy of the people.

472
00:36:43,449 --> 00:36:45,480
He must pay the ultimate penalty.

473
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,225
This woman

474
00:36:48,595 --> 00:36:51,972
tried to help him escape justice,
therefore

475
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:54,141
she must share his fate.

476
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,742
In future,
if anyone challenges my authority,

477
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:03,039
they shall suffer
the same punishment.

478
00:37:06,117 --> 00:37:08,694
Have the condemned any final words?

479
00:37:09,733 --> 00:37:11,683
Very well, Isabella. You win.

480
00:37:13,328 --> 00:37:15,478
Kill me if you must, but not her.

481
00:37:17,157 --> 00:37:18,957
I'll do whatever you want,

482
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:21,040
but don't take her life.

483
00:37:25,414 --> 00:37:28,964
- Proceed with the execution!
- She's just an innocent girl!

484
00:37:32,677 --> 00:37:33,985
What do we do?

485
00:37:35,264 --> 00:37:36,400
I said, proceed!

486
00:37:37,601 --> 00:37:40,838
For once, I agree with Gisborne.

487
00:37:59,437 --> 00:38:02,354
- Hood! Get him!
- Come on, come on!

488
00:38:02,721 --> 00:38:04,560
<i>Isabella!</i>

489
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:08,360
Didn't think you'd get rid of me
that easily, did you?

490
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,720
No!

491
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:12,520
I've come to take what's mine.
Your life.

492
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,837
Hey, hey, she doesn't deserve your help.
Come on!

493
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:22,680
Guy, no!

494
00:38:24,876 --> 00:38:26,336
Are you all right?

495
00:38:32,308 --> 00:38:34,880
We have to do this quickly.
Come on, hurry up!

496
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,624
Did you really think
I'd let you get away with it?

497
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,460
You've betrayed your husband
for the last time!

498
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:52,563
Isabella!

499
00:38:54,825 --> 00:38:57,069
Hey! Where are you going?
We've got what we came for.

500
00:38:57,189 --> 00:38:59,360
- I have to help her.
- She's your enemy!

501
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,080
Kate. I told him not to come back.
I warned him.

502
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,900
I have to sort this out.

503
00:39:05,106 --> 00:39:07,956
Here, take this. I'll catch you up.
Go on, go!

504
00:39:12,942 --> 00:39:14,701
- No, you don't!
- Don't you dare!

505
00:39:14,821 --> 00:39:16,579
- It's over.
- Just leave me alone!

506
00:39:16,699 --> 00:39:20,694
- You're finished.
- I warn you. Don't come any closer.

507
00:39:24,692 --> 00:39:26,800
You're going to die, Isabella...

508
00:39:30,905 --> 00:39:33,899
- with these.
- No, I beg you, please.

509
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:39,160
I'll give you everything you want.
Just let me live.

510
00:39:40,577 --> 00:39:41,605
I see now.

511
00:39:42,977 --> 00:39:44,680
I'll be a good wife.

512
00:39:45,046 --> 00:39:47,160
I will show you
the love of a good woman.

513
00:39:49,046 --> 00:39:50,046
Get up.

514
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,360
Stop snivelling, will you?

515
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,121
What have you done?

516
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,080
What I should have done years ago.

517
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,120
Isabella!

518
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,880
Your first murder.

519
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:26,770
You were supposed to finish him off,
but you weren't man enough.

520
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,672
I only kill
when there's no other way!

521
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:31,629
You'll get the blame for this
as far as Prince John is concerned.

522
00:40:31,749 --> 00:40:34,899
The murderous Hood still at large,
but not for long.

523
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,280
You listen to me!

524
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:40,520
We've taken your precious hoard.

525
00:40:40,681 --> 00:40:43,640
And in case you're wondering,
the deal's off.

526
00:40:45,511 --> 00:40:46,552
Let's go.

527
00:40:48,623 --> 00:40:49,623
Come on.

528
00:40:54,477 --> 00:40:56,627
Let's just rest here for a while.

529
00:40:58,775 --> 00:41:00,057
There we go.

530
00:41:16,008 --> 00:41:17,008
Please.

531
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:38,000
I always quite liked you.

532
00:42:11,828 --> 00:42:13,578
You can say it, you know.

533
00:42:14,692 --> 00:42:16,640
- Say what?
- "Say what?"

534
00:42:17,018 --> 00:42:18,466
You're dying to.

535
00:42:20,421 --> 00:42:21,526
All right.

536
00:42:22,918 --> 00:42:24,080
I told you so!

537
00:42:27,216 --> 00:42:30,200
You finally saw
what sort of a woman she really is.

538
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:32,032
Yeah, I did.

539
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:38,566
And I saw
what sort of woman you are.

540
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,545
You're brave

541
00:42:42,001 --> 00:42:43,560
and compassionate

542
00:42:44,251 --> 00:42:45,999
and you're beautiful.

543
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:04,450
Make sure
all of Thornton's men are dead.

544
00:43:04,777 --> 00:43:08,127
I don't want Prince John
hearing any more lies about me.

545
00:43:08,311 --> 00:43:09,454
See to it.

546
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,598
And next time...

547
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,928
it will be you...

548
00:43:23,657 --> 00:43:24,837
Robin Hood.

549
00:43:32,121 --> 00:43:35,000
I know the truth about how
your parents really died.

550
00:43:35,161 --> 00:43:37,645
Let me go, my father's inside!

551
00:43:39,351 --> 00:43:42,240
There are still things you don't know
about your past.

552
00:43:42,576 --> 00:43:44,560
Robin, you can be the best shot
in England.

553
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:48,440
- Roger of Gisborne, you are a leper.
- No, don't let them do this.

554
00:43:48,601 --> 00:43:50,960
Guy, act like a man, not a child.

555
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,800
I've been thinking about you
all day.

556
00:43:54,613 --> 00:43:57,600
You expected me to stay away
whilst you stole my wife.
