00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,040
previously on "one tree hill".

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,620
I wish.

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,070
I couldtake this pain away.

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,650
but I can'T.

5
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,670
And I'm sorry.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,970
Quentin was my brother.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,420
Quentin was my friend.

8
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,310
I've been seeing antwon,and he needs me now.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,490
What are you doing?!Hey!

10
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,040
Shoplift much?

11
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,620
Get off me,bitch!

12
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,770
Hey!

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,130
There was a therapistthat nathan and I went to.

14
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,060
I can give you her number if you want.

15
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,090
Okay.

16
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,850
Get your filthy,murdering handsaway from my son!

19
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,070
You need to quit that weak-ass fadeaway.

20
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,460
Huh?You want some cuddling?

21
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,000
Is that what you want?

22
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:07,910
Go home.

23
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,220
Crawl back in bed with your wife.

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,030
That's weak,nate.

25
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,090
The road to the nba goes through me,boy.

26
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,120
Come on!

27
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,960
The hardest part of saying goodbye.

28
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,020
is having to do it again every single day.

29
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,120
Well,well.

30
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,600
The prodigal coach returns.

31
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,090
Every day,we face the same truth --

32
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,440
that life is fleeting.

33
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,870
it's cool,coach taylor.

34
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,170
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

35
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,010
That our time here is short.

36
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,920
and to honor the fallen.

37
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,390
we must live our own lives well.

38
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,930
what does it say,mama?

39
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,970
"You will soar on wings like eagles.

40
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,020
You will run and not grow weary.

41
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,240
" Do you think there's basketball in heaven?

42
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,140
I know there is.

43
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,890
how long has it been?

44
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,650
Eight days.

45
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,930
I miss him.

46
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,830
Come on.

47
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,190
good morning,honey.

48
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,410
At least you're making noise.

49
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,390
Maybe next week I'll get a "hello.

50
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,510
Mom.you told me you were screwing one of my friends at a funeral.

51
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,340
I figured that meant you didn't really want to talk.

52
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,640
Okay.

53
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,870
I should have told you about my relationship with antwon before,

54
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,480
but we've got to find a way to deal with this,honey.

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,330
How can I live here if you're not gonna talk to me?

56
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,570
I was thinking the same thing.

57
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,480
I thought I could get used to it.

58
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,680
I haven'T.

59
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,460
And I can'T.

60
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,910
You're kicking me out?

61
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,010
Say hi to antwon for me.

62
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,780
Mama!It's grandpa dan.

63
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,730
He's dead!

64
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,260
No,buddy,he's not.

65
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,880
This is not what it looks like.

66
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:19,190
But you and daddy said the people in the cemetery are in heaven,like quentin.

67
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:26,920
Right,but,uh,some people like to buy their headstones before they die -- like way before.

68
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,810
Um,like the backpack that we got you the week before school started.

69
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,390
It's like that.Grandpa dan's just.being prepared.

70
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,640
- To die in a week?
- No.

71
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,500
He's -- he's alive.

72
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,760
Grandpa dan is alive,I promise.

73
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,250
Then can we go see him?

74
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,850
- Is that 
- yeah.Mick wolf.

75
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,440
Are you serious?

76
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,330
What is he doing here?

77
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,910
Recording,I guess.

78
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,930
Hi.

79
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,140
Uh,I hope you don't mind.You know,I see an empty studioand a guitar going to waste.

80
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,050
It's just an old habit.

81
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,280
No,no,it's cool.

82
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,490
Um,actually,it's an honor.I'm a huge fan.

83
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,880
I even have a couple of albumsyou played on up on the wall in my office.

84
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,940
Well,I'm the onewho's honored.

85
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,970
Mick wolf.

86
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,320
You're not supposed to bein my town,let alonemy recording studio.

87
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,760
So,why are you here?

88
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,240
My store was robbed,and I was attacked.

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,340
I see.

90
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,540
Victims of violenceoften find it helpful to talk through the experiencein therapy.

91
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,380
It helps them make senseof a random act.

92
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,100
This wasn't random.

93
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,990
Nothing my mother doesis random.

94
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,700
So,which one's yours?

95
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,370
Uh,mine's not here today.

96
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,510
Right.I think I've seen youwith him before -- the little blond-hred,blue-eyed cutie.

97
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,060
Actually,I'm his,uh.

98
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,710
I'm his nanny.

99
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,700
A least I wasuntil I got fired.

100
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,710
Been there.Believe me.

101
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,850
People don't realize how immensely important it isto be a nanny.

102
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,370
And they never appreciatetrue devotion.

103
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,470
It's enoughto drive you crazy.

104
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,810
Well,in my case,my son didn't appreciatewho I was sleeping with.

105
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,440
Yeah,they get so touchyabout that stuff.

106
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,580
- The heart wantswhat it wants.
- Yeah.

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,490
But then again,if it were me.

108
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,960
I would do whatever it takes to stayin that little boy's life.

109
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,060
Was there a history of abusein your family?

110
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,640
Growing up,I mean.

111
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,660
Not unless you considera high credit-card limit and no supervision abuse.

112
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,310
Yet you thinkyour mother attacked you.

113
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,870
I don't thinkvictoria did it personally.

114
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:45,290
I think she hired some flying monkeyto do her dirty work.

115
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,650
It must be hard for youto believe.

116
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,660
What mattersis that you believe it.

117
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,980
See,she knewthat I had just finished those sketchesfor my fall line,

118
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,740
she knew I was keeping themat the store,

119
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,650
and she knewthat if I showed up to my board meetingwithout them,

120
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,300
I would look incompetent.

121
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:13,460
And that's all she needsto convince the board to give her controlof my company.

122
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,650
It sounds shakespearean.

123
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,370
You probably thinkI'm crazy.

124
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,740
No,I don'T.

125
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,260
I think we havea lot to talk about.

126
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,050
How should I start,at the beginningor just from when I fired her?

127
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,400
You you fired your mom?

128
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,630
It'll be fine.

129
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,020
I can pick up the slack.

130
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,260
Besides,nanny deb was awolmost of the time,anyway.

131
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,600
Yeah.You know,it's funny.All these years,wecalled him "skills.

132
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,780
" I always thought it hadsomething to do with basketball.

133
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,490
That's not funny.

134
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,590
Kind of funny.

135
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,930
Come on,nate.

136
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,450
I..Andy wasn't much older than mewhen he started dating my mom,and,I mean,look how wellthat turned out.

137
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:58,570
Well,andy wasn't one of your classmates oryour supposed friends,and he wasn't seeing karenbehind your back.

138
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,520
You got to get over thisby tomorrow night's game.

139
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,160
Oh,I will,but I'll do it for Q Not for skills.

140
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,860
I'm really upsetwith that guy.

141
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,640
I know you are,but the teamneeds you and so will jamie.

142
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,410
And the way I see it,skills will be a better fatherthan dan ever was.

143
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,270
This iswhere grandpa dan lives?

144
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,730
Yeah,not bad,huh?

145
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,380
I think you shouldlet him babysit.

146
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,070
How come grandpaisn't picking up his papers?

147
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,760
I don't know,buddy.

148
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,840
Maybe he doesn't likewhat's in it.

149
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,170
Yeah,you're probably right.

150
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,650
I don't thinkhe's home,bud.

151
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,680
Hey,will you waitin the car for me?

152
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,840
But I want to seegrandpa dan.

153
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,350
I know,buddy.I just need a second.

154
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,920
Okay.Okay.

155
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,230
okay,dan,please don't berotting on the floor.

156
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,760
- Hi.
- Hey.

157
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,330
There's my baby girl.

158
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,340
So,what do you saywe go out tonight?

159
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,430
I mean,after all the sneaking around,I just want to be ableto show my girl off.

160
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,650
- Antwon.
- hmm?

161
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,560
Nathan kicked me outof the house.

162
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:37,270
Wow.I knew natewas mad,but that's messed up.

163
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,450
Look,I'm sorry.

164
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,550
Why don't you just stay herefor a while?

165
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,950
Mouth's gone.Plus,you've bn herelike every night,anyway.

166
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,500
It's not that easy.

167
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:57,200
I've worked really hard to get back into my son's lifeand jamie'S.

168
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,180
I can't compromise that now.

169
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,710
Uh-oh.I don't likewhere this is heading.

170
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,090
I think we have toface facts.

171
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,540
I mean,even if nathansomehow got over this,what would your parents say?

172
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,550
Well,my lastserious girlfriend was bevin.

173
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,360
So I'm sure they'll saythis is a step up.

174
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,600
I'm almost 20 years olderthan you.

175
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:27,040
Yeah,but you're only as oldas you feel.

176
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,570
And you feeljust right to me.

177
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,310
You're so sweet.

178
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,230
And I really like you.

179
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,140
But I'm sorry.

180
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,770
For the sake of my family,I think we have toend this.

181
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,470
You ever look backon all of it and just feel really fortunateto have been a part of it?

182
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,530
Yeah,I suppose so.

183
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,150
It's just I don't look backthat much.

184
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,660
God,you were right there!

185
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,930
I mean,you wereat the center of everything and making history and giving ussomething to believe in.

186
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,200
Didn't rolling stonecall you "the reluctant conscienceof rock"?

187
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,510
Yeah.Rolling stone also called mea cult favorite,

188
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,910
which is their way of sayingyou don't sell any records.

189
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,680
Is that why you stoppedrecording?

190
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,910
I mean,your own stuff.

191
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,350
No.I stopped recordingmy own stuff 'cause I didn't feel like I hadanything left worth saying.

192
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,700
You know,session workpays pretty good.You work a couple of weeksout of the month.

193
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,530
The rest of the timeis your own.

194
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,280
Yeah?

195
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,240
How about you let me fill up some of thatfree time with lunch?

196
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,990
I know a really good placedown by the water,and I kind of havea lot of questions.

197
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,660
What's the matter?

198
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,950
You look likeyou've seen a ghost.

199
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,190
I feel like I have.That's your mom's jacket.

200
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,720
You look just like her.

201
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,910
Well,mia told meshe met someone on tour who knew ellie,

202
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,320
but how could she not sayit was mick wolf?

203
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,880
Mia's a good kid.She's a good singer,

204
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,430
but she's way too youngto know who the hell I am.

205
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,210
How'd you know who i was?

206
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,290
When your mom got sick,it hit all of us hard --everyone who knew her.

207
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,530
Somewhere along the line,someone gave methat benefit cd you made,

208
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,510
and read what you said about her in the liner notes,which was which was beautiful. 

209
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,560
So I guess you could say I'm a fan of yours,too.

210
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,630
Did you know my dad?

211
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,210
No.

212
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,700
I don't think anyonereally knew your dad.

213
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,860
Hi.I'm looking for dr.Thornton.

214
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,640
It's about dan scott,my,uh.

215
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,730
My father-in-law.

216
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,860
And I was wondering if you couldjust have the doctor call me.

217
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,840
Okay.Thank you.

218
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,560
Hey,skills.Are you okay?

219
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,520
Nate ain't here,is he?

220
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,550
No,you're safe.

221
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,040
But you look,uh,not so great.

222
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,020
Deb broke up with me.

223
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:25,500
Well,I guess you can tusslewith a cougar,but you're gonna get bit.

224
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,330
Why everybody thinkit's a big joke?

225
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,810
Deb's just done a lotof wacky things in her life.

226
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,950
We never thoughtyou'd be one of them.

227
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,870
Look,I know it sounds crazy,but I really have feelingsfor her.

228
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,570
Really?

229
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,740
Well,all right.Well,let's,uh.

230
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,080
let's be realisticabout this.

231
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,690
How many good yearsdo you think deb has left?

232
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,910
Fine,laugh all you want.I just thought maybe you couldtalk to nate for me.

233
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,760
Oh,no.I don't want to gettin the middle of this.No,thank you.

234
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,150
Come on,haley.

235
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,250
You know we always hadeach other's backs.

236
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,480
I'll see what I can do.

237
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,370
Maybe you should just man upand talk to nathan yourself.

238
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,500
I notice you call your mother"victoria.

239
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,480
" She insisted after we wentinto business together.

240
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,600
Why did you go into businesswith her?

241
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,850
I don't know.

242
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,630
Maybe I wanted herto love me.

243
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,720
Is that something you still want?

244
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,310
I bought a gun.

245
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,780
That's not uncommonfor attack victims.

246
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,470
It gives them a feelingof control.

247
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,390
Unless you're having thoughtsof hurting your mother.

248
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,110
No.

249
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,110
I mean,I'm not crazy.

250
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,440
But it occurs to me that.

251
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,800
it wouldn't bother meif she were dead.

252
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,830
And that can't be healthy,right?

253
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:14,070
To feel likeif your mother was dead,you would't miss her,that you might be betterfor it.

254
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,960
And I just don't knowhow it got to this.

255
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,940
Maybe you should ask your motherthat question.

256
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:36,490
Antwon came to see me today,and he said that deb broke up with him.

257
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,390
He's pretty upset.

258
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,530
Good.

259
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,360
He shouldn't have beensleeping with my mom.

260
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,480
Said theanwho slept with my sister.

261
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,110
I remember the first time I saw you.I was sittingat the geek table,

262
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,930
and you were sitting over thereat the jock table,

263
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,130
and if we had playedby the rules of high school,we wouldn't be sitting hereat this table.

264
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,750
Okay,all right,I get it.

265
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,240
You and I weren't the mostconventional couple,either.

266
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,940
Are you ever gonna stop tryingto make me into a better personal

267
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,680
it's not likely.

268
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:10,400
Speaking of exiled parents,did you know that dn alreadyhas a headstone at the emetery?

269
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,890
It makes keith's stonelook tiny by comparison.

270
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,650
Leave it to dan scott to get into a pissing contestwith keith even after he's dead.

271
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,820
Yeah,well,jamie saw it,and he freaked out and insisted on seeing dan.

272
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,130
I didn't knowwhat else to do.

273
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,370
I-I took himover to the beach house.

274
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,030
- Haley 
- I'm sorry.

275
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,470
Dan wasn't home,though.

276
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,920
In fact,it looked like hehadn't been home in a few days.

277
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,620
When was the last timeyou saw him?

278
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,890
I don't know.A few weeks ago?

279
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,790
He's playingmind games again.

280
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,730
I basically told himto go off and die.

281
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,400
Well,I'm worriedabout jamie.

282
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,930
He's -- he's still trying to getover the death of quentin,and now dan's disappeared.

283
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,030
I know we didn't want himaround,but jamie did.

284
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,690
It feels kind of selfish.

285
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,850
Well,rememberwho we're talking about.

286
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,500
Yeah.

287
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,000
Hey,andre.

288
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,730
- How have you been?
- So-so.

289
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,220
Yeah?Have you been playingbasketball?

290
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,330
A little.

291
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,490
Do you thinkI could be a raven someday?

292
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,200
Mama says I'm gonna beas tall as quentin.

293
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,900
At least 9 feet.

294
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,970
Well,I bet you will.

295
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,930
Why don't you come see me in about 10 years,all right?

296
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,840
A little early to be recruiting,isn't it?

297
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,420
Hi,coach.

298
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,010
Why don't you come on in?

299
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,340
Get off me!

300
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,060
Enough!Okay?

301
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,980
I'm gonna seeevery one of you in detention.

302
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,370
Hold on.

303
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,990
Hey,are you okay?

304
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:04,370
Congratulations on your firsttree hill catfight.I've had a few in my day.

305
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,620
Spare methe female bonding,okay?

306
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,920
I may be new,but I've heardall about mrs.James-scott,a cheerleader who datedthe star of the basketball team.

307
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,140
That is,when you weren'ton a rock tour.

308
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,100
Your life must have beenreally tough.

309
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,540
So just don't pretendlike you know anything about my problems,okay?

310
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,920
See you in detention,hannah montana.

311
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,590
hey,I foundyour shoplifter.

312
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,410
I knew it.

313
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,490
That little street urchindoes go to tree hill high.

314
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,240
Thank you.

315
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,060
She's justa messed-up kid.

316
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,330
She's a messed-up kidtaking growth hormones.

317
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,590
She knocked meflat on my ass.

318
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,650
She just transferred here.

319
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,480
I think she was probablyjust looking for a way to impress kidswith some new clothes,you know?

320
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,380
I'll give her pointsfor having good taste.

321
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,240
Just try and keep her awayfrom my store.

322
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,300
Hey!James lucas scott,step away from the mannequin before I come over there and pluck out your eyells.

323
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,170
Did I just soundlike a total bitch?

324
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,560
Yes.And you also sounded like a mom -- a good one.

325
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,740
Oh,he usually makes itso easy.

326
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,910
Hmm.And what happenswhen he doesn't?

327
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,010
He's still the most loved kidin the world.

328
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,440
- okay?
- Yeah.

329
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,550
I just wish I had had a family like yours.

330
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,930
You do.You're aunt brooke.

331
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,880
- You okay?
- Yeah.

332
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:36,400
Yeah.I just -- you know,ellie never really told me a lot about my father.

333
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,730
And I guess she didn't want meto know much.

334
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,880
I don't know.

335
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:46,210
And so I was just hopingyou could -- I don't know.

336
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,930
I knew him a little.

337
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,160
Um.ellie loved him.

338
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,260
And he loved her right back.

339
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:01,640
And their romance was oneof the all-time greats.

340
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,550
which meant it was messy.

341
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:10,730
But,uh.we shouldall be that lucky,right?

342
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,940
To be so passionate about someone.

343
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,440
Yeah.Oh,oh,which reminds me.

344
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,470
Um,god,my fiancis gonna kill me if I let you leave townwithout meeting him.

345
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,950
You don't like basketballby any chance,do you?

346
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:30,230
- Bobcats? 
- Ravens.

347
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,550
Microwave soup?

348
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,610
What's the problem?

349
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:48,050
Nanny deb always makes mesliders on game days.

350
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,150
Oh,she does,huh?

351
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,200
With two picklesfor good luck.

352
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,520
Well,daddy nathanmakes you soup.

353
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,330
When is she coming back?

354
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,580
I don't know,buddy.

355
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,860
Is it becauseshe was kissing uncle skills?

356
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,810
- You knew about that?
- Yeah.

357
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:11,220
They tried to pretend he was getting somethingout of her eye,but they were just being all mushy.

358
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,550
Yeah.And how does it feel to be scarred for life?

359
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,610
Fine.I like nanny deb.

360
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,590
I like uncle skills.

361
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,730
So what if they likeeach other?

362
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,740
It's a little more complicatedthan that.

363
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,760
Your nanny deb is also my mom.

364
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,400
Yeah.But I let you kiss my mom.

365
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,990
Eat your soup.

366
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,330
As you all know,tonight's basketball gameis dedicated to quentin,

367
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,050
and I think it would be great if you could all be there,so no homework.

368
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,340
But don't worry.We'll make itup next week,though.I promise.

369
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,530
Sam.stick around.I want to talk to you.

370
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:01,680
Um.I read your paperthat you wrote on quentin.

371
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:07,490
It was very good,and I think you should spendsome more time writing.

372
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,690
and maybe a little less timeshoplifting.

373
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,840
I don't knowwhat you're talking about.

374
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:14,910
Relax.

375
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,050
One of my best friends,brooke,owns clothes over bros,and she's not gonnapress charges.

376
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,880
Actually,she sent you a gift.

377
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,550
You know,I'm not homeless,okay?

378
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,810
Tell your friendI don't need her charity.

379
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,760
Sam.I don't knowwhat you're going through.

380
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,260
I don't know anythingabout your life.

381
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:40,260
But if you want to talk,I am here to listen.

382
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,430
Great.

383
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,380
why don't you guyshead to the locker room?

384
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,320
Come on.We got a game tonight.

385
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,140
Hey,nate,can we talk?

386
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,840
Hey,grandpa.

387
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,310
Look,I'm hereto support the team,skills.

388
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,660
I don't really have anythingto say to you.

389
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,160
Then don'T.Just listen.

390
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,840
I know me and deb together sounds likesome freaky porn thing,and maybe it startedthat way.

391
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,750
This isn't helping.

392
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,770
But the thing is.

393
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,230
Your mom makes me happy.

394
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,050
And I thinkI make her happy,too.

395
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,220
I can't believe we're evenhaving this conversation.

396
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,270
Look,neither one of uswants to do anything that's gonna mess things upfor you.

397
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,740
It's a little latefor that.

398
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,710
Okay,you're right.

399
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,680
I should have told you abouteverything from the beginning.

400
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,730
But I reallycare for her,nate.

401
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,800
Look,I'll just leave the ballin your court.

402
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,990
all right,look,I know you don't feel muchlike playing basketball tonight.

403
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,770
And I get it.

404
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,810
When I was in high school,someone close to mewas taken away.

405
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:16,970
And I-I couldn't understand how a gamecould matter anymore.

406
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,860
But my coach was a wise man,

407
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,960
and he told me that basketballwas more than just a game,

408
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,930
that it had the powerto heal me if I let it.

409
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,540
he was right.

410
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:40,460
now there's someone elseI'd like you to hear from.

411
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,700
Hi,guys.

412
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:52,650
This last weekhas been hard on all of us.

413
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:58,140
But what gets me through is trying to rememberthe happy times with quentin.

414
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:03,200
And lord knows that boywas never happier than when he was holdinga basketball.

415
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:10,160
Now,coach says that,um,some of you might be feelinga little guilty about playing tonight.

416
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,410
Well,let me tell youone thing that I know.

417
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,680
Quentin would want youto play tonight.

418
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,450
Play your hearts out.

419
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,030
And if you don'T.

420
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:23,120
well,andre here -- I think he's gonna go outand play for you.

421
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,540
Right,baby?

422
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,300
And one more thing.

423
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:34,150
Don't feel like you're moving onwithout quentin because he's gonna be with youon that court.

424
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,810
I'm sure of that.

425
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,170
So am I.

426
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:50,700
And he's gonna be right here right by your heart.

427
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:56,950
So.who wants to carry him outonto that court?

428
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:30,400
every day,we facethe same truth,that our time here is short.

429
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:37,510
And to honor the fallen,we must liveour own lives well.

430
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:45,710
We must take the high roadwhen we can and allow our common loss to bring us together.

431
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,070
I think that's the way Q.Would have wanted it.

432
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:54,580
And while tonight we miss our fallen teammate.

433
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,410
friend.

434
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,310
loved one.

435
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,970
we commemorate him for all time.

436
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:07,900
No raven will ever wear the number 44 again.

437
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:14,850
And for as longas this gym stands,quentin fields.

438
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,210
will be here with us.

439
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,030
No one can take his placeon this team.

440
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,330
And no one.

441
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:26,830
can take his placein our hearts.

442
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:52,690
moment silence for Number 44,quentin fields.

443
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,190
Hi,chester.Long time,no see.

444
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,400
I just need.

445
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:19,490
a few of jamie's thingsfor our little road trip,just enoughto make him comfortable.

446
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,130
These peopleare so lost without me.

447
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,570
It's a good thingyou can't talk,chester.

448
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,510
Otherwise,you'd be my dinner tonight.

449
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,640
Mmm.Tasty.

450
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,380
Hello,victoria.

00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,840

463

Come on,ravens!

464
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,920
Come on,now!

465
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,920
This might be the greatest lossI'll ever see.

466
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,190
Well,sometimesit's not about winning.

467
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,560
Sometimes it's about healing.

468
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,680
Now's your chance.

469
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,180
The gun's loaded.Just aim low.

470
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,640
I'd like to look goodat my funeral.

471
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,530
What is the matterwith you?

472
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,620
What -- what happenedto your eyes?

473
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,240
As if you don'talready know.

474
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:35,800
All I know is that my daughtershows up at my doorstep with a gun.

475
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:39,550
All I know is my motherhad me attacked in my store.

476
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,260
Oh,my god.Brooke.

477
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,700
are you sayingit wasn't you?

478
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:48,910
Did you go to the police?

479
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,360
Does anyone elseknow about this?

480
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,860
Don't worry.

481
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,150
You've trained me very well.

482
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,040
I put the company first.

483
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:00,160
It's just the publicity.

484
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,190
This from the woman who saidshe could spin it favorably if I had a drug problem.

485
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,190
I want you to answermy question.

486
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,770
You want an answer?

487
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,190
Here's one.

488
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,270
I would neverphysically harm you.

489
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,070
Well,maybe you didn'tmean to.

490
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,620
It was late.You thought millicentwould be there.You hate her.

491
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,580
You are so paranoid --and wrong.

492
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:31,240
Someone died last week.

493
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:41,870
And I wasn't close to him,but my friends were,and yet,in the midstof all their grief,I felt nothing.

494
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,840
I just felt cold.

495
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,490
And I realized I'm turninginto the one person I do not want to become.

496
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,470
I'm turning into you.

497
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,180
What do you want meto say,brooke?

498
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,870
That I was a failureas a mother?

499
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,840
You got everythingyou wanted.

500
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,620
Except your love.

501
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,140
When I was your age,I dreamed of havinga clothing line,of having a business.

502
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,270
Of all the thingsyou have.

503
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,820
But I stupidly fell in love.

504
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:22,330
And one morning,your father and igot a little surprise.

505
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,010
I told himI didn't want kids.

506
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,150
It was never the plan.

507
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:32,930
But he wanted a sonmore than anything.

508
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:38,220
And as soon as I got fat,he had an excuse to jump intoany bed he wanted.

509
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:46,280
And when we hadour little baby girl,I made sure I would neverbe pregnant again.

510
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:51,140
If I couldn't have my dream,your fathercouldn't have his,either.

511
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,300
I probably took it out on youa little too much along the way,but you know what?

512
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:02,140
You should be thanking mefor giving you life.Do you understand that?

513
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,590
I do thank you.

514
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,070
Because now I knowit wasn't my fault.

515
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,270
It was never my fault.

516
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:17,120
I'm calling the lawyerstomorrow,and I'm divesting my interestsin clothes over bros --

517
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:21,310
the magazine,the line.

518
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,870
You can have everything.

519
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,450
Congratulations,victoria.

520
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,570
Now you have a companyand no daughter.

521
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,430
You got your dream.

522
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,810
Years from now,the record bookswill show that.

523
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:04,010
the ravens lost to the wildcatson this night.

524
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:12,700
But here's somethingthat those records won't show,something that.

525
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,460
no one in that gymwill ever forget.

526
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:37,260
that the four-man ravens made the wildcats fight and scratch and claw for every single secondof that win.

527
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:48,560
And in doing so,they showed that a team will always be more importantthan statistics.

528
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:57,520
When your grandkids ask you about this game,you tell them that you played hard.

529
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,840
for quentin fields.

530
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,650
that you stood tall.

531
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,730
and you did itto honor your friend.

532
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,690
You shouldbe proud of yourselves,men.

533
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,270
I know I'm proud of you.

534
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,900
Coach.

535
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:28,210
we want to play with fourthe rest of the season.

536
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,790
That's gonna be hardon all of you.

537
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,510
We want to do it for Q.

538
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,210

539
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,070

541
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,770

543
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,990

546
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,870
Maybe one more thing.

547
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,430

548
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:58,670

549
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:04,830

But you've had to sacrificeso much for me over the years,nathan.

562
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,540
I just don't want to see it.

563
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,230
Okay,I don't want to hear about it.

564
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:44,720

Uh.that was dan's doctor.

572
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:28,530
Apparently,they had a heart for him and he neveranswered their call.

573
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,120
Then he really hasgone off to die.

574
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,870
Hey,nate.

575
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,600

00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,690

00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,990
So maybe that'swhere we start.
