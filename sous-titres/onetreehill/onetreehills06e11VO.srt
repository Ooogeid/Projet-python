14
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:49,887
from tying him to a chair
and beating him to death.

15
00:00:52,023 --> 00:00:54,191
hey, what's the deal
with this dove pendant?

16
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:55,492

00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,127
oh, my dad brought that back for me

18
00:00:57,195 --> 00:00:59,630

not ready you lose you
yet, you knucklehead.

28
00:01:17,382 --> 00:01:19,383

44
00:02:40,498 --> 00:02:42,132
save the gossip for your column.

45
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:44,234

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,275
you look good.

49
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:54,178

00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:16,767
and how is brooke davis tonight?

52
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:19,603
problems with men, problems with money.

53
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:21,505
you could help me with both.

54
00:03:23,742 --> 00:03:25,109
nice dress.

55
00:03:25,176 --> 00:03:28,379
do you like it? i made it myself.

56
00:03:28,413 --> 00:03:30,080
now, how about my problems?

57
00:03:30,115 --> 00:03:33,317
you know i never mix
business with pleasure.

58
00:03:33,351 --> 00:03:34,785
just pleasure, then?

59
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:38,522
i have karen's café now.

60
00:03:38,556 --> 00:03:40,124
she's all the lady i need.

61
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:41,392
i'm sorry, brooke.

62
00:03:41,426 --> 00:03:43,327
now, if you'll excuse me...

63
00:03:45,463 --> 00:03:46,830
you'll be back.

64
00:03:52,771 --> 00:03:54,805
nice shot.

65
00:03:56,508 --> 00:03:58,475
you're gonna be a hard man to replace.

66
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,679
and how's the search for
my replacement coming?

67
00:04:01,713 --> 00:04:04,748
well, it'd be a lot easier if
i knew when i was losing you.

68
00:04:04,783 --> 00:04:06,350
when i know, you'll know.

69
00:04:06,384 --> 00:04:07,985
you rented out my room upstairs yet?

70
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:09,186
nope.

71
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,121
it'll be waiting for
you when you get back.

72
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:15,359
hey, shouldn't haley be on by now?

73
00:04:18,596 --> 00:04:19,930
let's give her a minute.

74
00:04:25,737 --> 00:04:31,041
<i>... that we will
not only defend ourselves to thestttermo,</i>

75
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:34,278
<i>but will make it very certain</i>

76
00:04:34,346 --> 00:04:39,950
<i>that this form of treachery
shall never again endanger us.</i>

77
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:42,986
<i>hostilities exist...</i>

78
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:44,621
yes, they do.

79
00:04:45,957 --> 00:04:47,591
what are you doing here?

80
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,694
oh, i'm just checking up on my singer.

81
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:52,296
<i>i'm not your anything.</i>

82
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:57,468
is that any way to speak to
the man who gave you everything?

83
00:04:57,502 --> 00:04:58,635
set you up in his club?

84
00:04:58,703 --> 00:05:01,305
saved you from being
in a traveling sideshow?

85
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:05,576
and yet you leave the
comet club for karen's café.

86
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,144
i want you back.

87
00:05:07,178 --> 00:05:08,746
oh, still feisty. i like that.

88
00:05:08,813 --> 00:05:10,714
listen, mister, if you think
i'm going back to that hellhole,

89
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:11,882
you've got another thing coming.

90
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,117
hellhole, is it? yes,ellhole.

91
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:14,885
the classiest joint within
100 miles, and you know it.

92
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:15,986
classy? classy, my foot.

93
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:17,221
who do you think you
are? dorothy dandridge?

94
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:18,856
those good old boys
never cared about my voice

95
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,790
long as they could see my legs

96
00:05:19,824 --> 00:05:20,924
and my chest hiked up to my ears.

97
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,393
i'll never go back, and that's final.

98
00:05:22,427 --> 00:05:24,661
you know what? i decide what's final!

99
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:30,100
oh, so that's what it's like?

100
00:05:30,135 --> 00:05:33,003
you are ...  ugh!

101
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:34,071
one of these days,

102
00:05:34,105 --> 00:05:36,306
someone's gonna stand
up to you, dan scott,

103
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:37,841
and i, for one, can't wait.

104
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:39,810
sing me something sweet tonight, doll.

105
00:05:39,844 --> 00:05:42,946
i'll be watching.

106
00:05:43,014 --> 00:05:44,281

107
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:52,656

expensive champagne

163
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,224
i saw you drinking over there.

164
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:42,393

166
00:08:44,262 --> 00:08:45,896

you know, i actually thought
this was my club for a while,

174
00:09:03,882 --> 00:09:05,783
considering that's my singer up there.

175
00:09:07,686 --> 00:09:10,421
oh, i'm sorry to inform you,
but your club's down the road.

176
00:09:10,455 --> 00:09:12,690
it's the one lacking customers.

177
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:14,591
funny.

178
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:17,428
give me my girl back,

179
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:21,665
haley's free to do whatever she wants,

180
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:23,267
and she wants to stay here.

181
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:26,236
now, you, on the other
hand, are free to go.

182
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,541
you know, this club had such an elegance

183
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:31,542
when your mom ran it.

184
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:35,145
i remember being treated
with such respect.

185
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,882
and sometimes i was treated
to a few other things.

186
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:40,884
it's too bad your mom ran off

187
00:09:40,952 --> 00:09:43,587
after that horrible accident with keith.

188
00:09:43,655 --> 00:09:45,823
i mean, she was always so...

189
00:09:48,493 --> 00:09:50,094
... hospitable.

190
00:09:50,128 --> 00:09:52,930
i think it's time for you
to get out of my club...

191
00:09:52,964 --> 00:09:54,431
or i will throw you out.

192
00:09:54,499 --> 00:09:55,866
julian?

193
00:09:57,268 --> 00:09:59,570
dan!

194
00:09:59,604 --> 00:10:01,138
that's enough for tonight.

195
00:10:13,551 --> 00:10:16,387
thanks for a lovely evening.

196
00:10:37,942 --> 00:10:40,678
sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

197
00:10:40,712 --> 00:10:42,613
a round on the house.

198
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:44,815
haley james.

199
00:10:47,018 --> 00:10:49,219
"gee, don't you know
that you're in for a show"

200
00:10:49,254 --> 00:10:54,425
"when you go,
go, go-o-o-o-o"

201
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:56,760
"ohh"

202
00:10:56,795 --> 00:10:58,962
"gee, don't you know"

203
00:10:58,997 --> 00:11:01,532
"that you're in for a show"

204
00:11:01,566 --> 00:11:03,267
"when you go down"

205
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:10,741
"to kare-e-e-e-n's
café?"

206
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:15,608
oh, hey, good to see you.

207
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:16,609
check out those gams.

208
00:11:16,644 --> 00:11:17,744
hey, not tonight, all right?

209
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:19,612
oh, let's have us a
dance. listen, get off.

210
00:11:19,647 --> 00:11:21,548
oh, come on, give me
some sugar. get off!

211
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,385
sugary enough for you?

212
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,121
you okay?

213
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,290
thank you, but maybe you
should cut that guy off.

214
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:33,059
maybe i should buy him
another drink on the house.

215
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,028
and why would you do that?

216
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,763
'cause he gave the bartender an excuse

217
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:38,298
to talk to the gorgeous singer.

218
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,100
"... in between when
you're lookin' at me"

219
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:42,502
"i know"

220
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,571
"i know"

221
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:47,307
"i know"

222
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:49,809
you know, in that case,
maybe you should give him two.

223
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:51,377
the second one's from me.

224
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,855
julian, give us a moment.

225
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,935
your mother made me promise
one thing before she died ...

226
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,171
that i would always look after you.

227
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:20,874
i know.

228
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:25,111
i saw you making eyes at lucas tonight.

229
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:28,248
i was doing nothing of the sort.

230
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:31,284
i know what i saw. don't
make a liar out of me.

231
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,126
go to bed.

232
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:50,003
i believe you, peyton.

233
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:53,206
i know you only have eyes for me.

234
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,141
sweet dreams.

235
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:06,386
oh, i think i had a
few too many tonight.

236
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,788
oh, you have a few too
many every night, mouth ...

237
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,023
keeping me in business.

238
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:11,891
now, are you gonna be okay to get home?

239
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:13,393
yeah, i'm fine. all right.

240
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:15,361
i'm going places, luke. i know.

241
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,765
which way am i going?

242
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:23,536
thanks, pal.

243
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:24,971
i used to be great, luke.

244
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,707
i was the best reporter
in tree hill city.

245
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,676
but i'm working on something big.

246
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:32,145
i'm telling you ... no
more gossip columns for me.

247
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:33,613
it's big, luke.

248
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,616
they'll see. they'll all see me again.

249
00:13:38,786 --> 00:13:40,887
does anybody see me here?

250
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,026
have a good night.

251
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,897
last chance.

252
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:51,865
good night, brooke.

253
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:58,438
<i>and, brooke, those
were nice days we had.</i>

254
00:13:58,472 --> 00:13:59,772
sure they were.

255
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:02,809
sorry i had to break your heart.

256
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:08,381
are you sure you can still
handle your whiskey, luke?

257
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:09,582
yeah, i'm fine. why?

258
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:11,618
'cause you just let brooke
davis walk out of here

259
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:13,653
without paying her tab.

260
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:17,023
i've been working with you 10 years,

261
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,259
and i've never seen you
tear up a bar tab before.

262
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:22,161
she's just down on her luck.

263
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:24,330
mark my word, skills ...

264
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:26,966
someday, brooke davis is
gonna change the world.

265
00:14:33,908 --> 00:14:35,642
taxi!

266
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:43,883
on second thought, i'll walk.

267
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:45,218
thanks.

268
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:52,158
sir?

269
00:14:53,761 --> 00:14:55,228
have a good night.

270
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,609
nice night for a walk.

271
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:12,045
i told you i don't have your money yet.

272
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,580
oh, that's a damn shame,

273
00:15:13,614 --> 00:15:15,281
'cause, you see, i'm a businessman,

274
00:15:15,316 --> 00:15:16,683
so when i make an investment,

275
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:18,852
i expect to see a return
on that investment.

276
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:21,654
i spent it on the start-up
costs for my garment line.

277
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:23,189
it's just been a slow start.

278
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:26,960
if you could just give me more time.

279
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:29,863
you want more time.

280
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:35,201
okay.

281
00:15:35,236 --> 00:15:36,870
i'm a fair-minded person.

282
00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:39,205
company needs a chance to get started,

283
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,306
get some advertising,

284
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:41,808
word of mouth, build up a clientele.

285
00:15:41,842 --> 00:15:43,042
that's right.

286
00:15:43,077 --> 00:15:44,110
okay, i understand.

287
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:46,379
i'll give you until...

288
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:49,949
tomorrow night ... midnight.

289
00:15:49,984 --> 00:15:51,417
or else.

290
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:01,694
you want me to rough her up?

291
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:02,862
no.

292
00:16:02,897 --> 00:16:04,898
no, we'll give her another day.

293
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,133
meanwhile, go get me that nosy cop.

294
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:09,235
my calluses could use a workout.

295
00:16:21,937 --> 00:16:23,056
tree hill city, born and raised.

296
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,977
what brought you here?

297
00:16:25,488 --> 00:16:27,889
well, i know it sounds a
bit corny, but, the rain.

298
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:29,655
i know nobody likes the rain,

299
00:16:30,024 --> 00:16:32,846
but i was traveling from
theater to theater, performing.

300
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,246
and while the money was great...

301
00:16:35,742 --> 00:16:37,438
well, i really missed having
a place i could call home,

302
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,520
so i moved here d fell
for the rhythm of the rain.

303
00:16:42,555 --> 00:16:46,458
unfortunately, i also got stuck
at dan's place for a while.

304
00:16:46,492 --> 00:16:49,427
but then lucas found
me, brought me here,

305
00:16:49,495 --> 00:16:51,029
and it was a perfect fit.

306
00:16:51,063 --> 00:16:53,031
great club, rainy city.

307
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:54,666
home.

308
00:16:54,734 --> 00:16:57,802
i think i'll stay a while,
if lucas will have me.

309
00:16:57,837 --> 00:17:00,171
well, i know karen would approve.

310
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:02,774
we all kind of miss her around here.

311
00:17:02,808 --> 00:17:04,376
after she lost keith,

312
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,144
she left the club to lucas, and...

313
00:17:07,213 --> 00:17:08,413
... she would be proud

314
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:10,782
to have a woman of your heart and talent

315
00:17:10,816 --> 00:17:12,284
working here at the café.

316
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,955
well, i sure can class
up a joint, now, can't i?

317
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:18,323
yes, you sure can.

318
00:17:23,262 --> 00:17:25,063
i was ...

319
00:17:25,097 --> 00:17:27,132
i was wondering if maybe you might want

320
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,800
to step out with me sometime.

321
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:32,037
well, why don't you stop wondering

322
00:17:32,071 --> 00:17:34,773
and ask me sometime?

323
00:17:36,842 --> 00:17:38,476
nathan?

324
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:39,945
excuse me.

325
00:17:45,518 --> 00:17:46,985
before you get in too deep.

326
00:17:59,565 --> 00:18:01,600
everything all right?

327
00:18:01,634 --> 00:18:03,902
how would you like to
step out with me tonight?

328
00:18:03,936 --> 00:18:06,471
sorry, but we're closed.

329
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:07,672
i know.

330
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,708
my car broke down.

331
00:18:09,775 --> 00:18:10,775
right.

332
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,410
so you can lure me outside,

333
00:18:12,478 --> 00:18:15,146
and dan and five of his
goons will work me over?

334
00:18:15,214 --> 00:18:16,915
no, thanks.

335
00:18:16,949 --> 00:18:18,283
dan's not with me.

336
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,654
i promise.

337
00:18:24,156 --> 00:18:25,423
let me grab my coat.

338
00:18:35,601 --> 00:18:38,203
well, i'll see what i can do.

339
00:18:38,237 --> 00:18:40,939
i'm not really the mechanic type.

340
00:18:43,376 --> 00:18:45,544
the advancements on these
things are amazing, aren't they?

341
00:18:45,578 --> 00:18:46,578
how much she set you back?

342
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:48,280
oh, hundreds.

343
00:18:48,314 --> 00:18:50,215
what do you drive?

344
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:51,650
i don't.

345
00:18:51,684 --> 00:18:53,051
i guess i'm not ready

346
00:18:53,085 --> 00:18:55,587
to give up on good,
old-fashioned walking.

347
00:18:55,621 --> 00:18:58,456
you know, no one ever
stands up to dan that way.

348
00:18:58,524 --> 00:19:00,525
that right?

349
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,761
and to be perfectly honest,

350
00:19:02,795 --> 00:19:06,731
i think the confrontation
made him respect you.

351
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:09,301
that's how he judges people, you know?

352
00:19:09,335 --> 00:19:11,703
"are they weak or are they strong?"

353
00:19:11,737 --> 00:19:12,938
it's just his way.

354
00:19:12,972 --> 00:19:15,140
it's not my way.

355
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,274
i'm a kind man,

356
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:18,176
unless you give me a
reason to be otherwise.

357
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,581
i'm sorry. i ...

358
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:25,317
my uncle keith was the
mechanic in the family.

359
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:27,886
it's okay. leave it.

360
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,422
you wouldn't mind a good,
old-fashioned walk home,

361
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:31,456
would you?

362
00:19:34,393 --> 00:19:36,661
sure. i can do that.

363
00:19:36,696 --> 00:19:40,165
where do you live?

364
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:41,867
that way.

365
00:19:41,901 --> 00:19:43,635
let's go.

366
00:19:53,246 --> 00:19:56,181
i'm not sure
how i feel about the war.

367
00:19:56,249 --> 00:19:59,851
i do mostly feel sorry for
our boys having to leave home.

368
00:19:59,886 --> 00:20:02,320
i could fight, though.

369
00:20:02,355 --> 00:20:04,189
what? i could.

370
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,024
or be a nurse.

371
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:08,260
what do you think?
would i be a good nurse?

372
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:10,262
yeah, i guess.

373
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:12,664
do you think i'm pretty?

374
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:18,069
i don't think i know you well enough yet

375
00:20:18,137 --> 00:20:20,438
to say something like that.

376
00:20:20,473 --> 00:20:23,475
well, you certainly don't
talk very much, do you?

377
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:25,644
now, why would you want to walk me home

378
00:20:25,678 --> 00:20:26,978
if you didn't walk to talk?

379
00:20:27,013 --> 00:20:28,713
i'm not really the gabbing type.

380
00:20:29,782 --> 00:20:31,149
what does a girl have to do

381
00:20:31,183 --> 00:20:33,218
for some interesting conversation...

382
00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:34,753
short of throwing myself at you?

383
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,659
okay. i have a question for you.

384
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:44,963
why do you associate
yourself with a guy like dan?

385
00:20:44,997 --> 00:20:46,064
he's scum.

386
00:20:46,098 --> 00:20:48,099
everybody knows what
types of things he's into

387
00:20:48,134 --> 00:20:49,634
over there at the comet club.

388
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:52,804
people disappear around him.

389
00:20:52,872 --> 00:20:55,173
and yet...

390
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,775
you let him own you.

391
00:20:56,809 --> 00:20:58,877
never mind.

392
00:20:58,911 --> 00:21:00,011
oh, no, you said you wanted to talk.

393
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,046
now, here i am, walking you home,

394
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,782
against his wishes, i'm sure.

395
00:21:03,816 --> 00:21:06,151
i'd just like to know.

396
00:21:06,219 --> 00:21:09,154
it's a long story.

397
00:21:09,188 --> 00:21:11,223
i've got time.

398
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:16,962
my mother and dan were in love.

399
00:21:16,996 --> 00:21:18,163
and when she died,

400
00:21:18,197 --> 00:21:20,765
he vowed he would always look after me.

401
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,467
i'm not his girl.

402
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:24,669
i have my own place.

403
00:21:24,704 --> 00:21:27,272
he just keeps me close
to him and takes me out.

404
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,341
you're a trinket.

405
00:21:29,408 --> 00:21:31,343
i'm cared for.

406
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:32,544
is that whatou call it?

407
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:37,315
i'm sorry.

408
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:40,385
i'm not trying to be rude. i just ...

409
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:42,287
i don't like the guy is all.

410
00:21:42,321 --> 00:21:45,090
it's not that.

411
00:21:47,493 --> 00:21:48,994
i need to get out.

412
00:21:49,028 --> 00:21:52,163
i have been locked up my entire life,

413
00:21:52,198 --> 00:21:55,534
and i need to breathe.

414
00:21:55,568 --> 00:21:57,769
i need freedom.

415
00:21:57,803 --> 00:21:59,738
i need love.

416
00:22:07,813 --> 00:22:12,350
"love..."

417
00:22:12,385 --> 00:22:15,487
when you asked me to
step out with you tonight,

418
00:22:15,521 --> 00:22:18,490
i didn't imagine it
would be at karen's café.

419
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:20,191
why not?

420
00:22:20,226 --> 00:22:22,994
we've got the best piano player in town.

421
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:25,564
and the best drinks.

422
00:22:25,598 --> 00:22:28,466
and the best bartender.

423
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:34,406
haley, i have to tell you something.

424
00:22:36,943 --> 00:22:40,111
that letter that luke
gave me earlier ...

425
00:22:40,146 --> 00:22:43,081
my unit's been called up
for active military duty,

426
00:22:43,115 --> 00:22:45,317
and i have to report tomorrow night...

427
00:22:45,351 --> 00:22:49,154
which means that this is
my last night here, but...

428
00:22:49,188 --> 00:22:50,722
i want you to know

429
00:22:50,756 --> 00:22:54,759
that i wouldn't want to
spend it with anyone but you.

430
00:22:56,762 --> 00:22:59,197
is that the truth? because...

431
00:23:01,634 --> 00:23:03,835
because i want to believe that it is.

432
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,470
yes.

433
00:23:07,173 --> 00:23:08,907
this is perfect to me.

434
00:23:08,941 --> 00:23:11,109
"... i've fallen"

435
00:23:11,177 --> 00:23:14,312
"it's your fault, baby"

436
00:23:14,347 --> 00:23:17,315
"if i'm a fool"

437
00:23:17,383 --> 00:23:19,818
"you must be..."

438
00:23:19,852 --> 00:23:22,053
i want to fall in love.

439
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:25,690
my whole life has been planned and safe.

440
00:23:25,725 --> 00:23:27,359
dan won't let men court me.

441
00:23:27,426 --> 00:23:29,861
but for once, i want
to make my own choices,

442
00:23:29,896 --> 00:23:32,831
even if that means my heart
shatters into a million pieces

443
00:23:32,865 --> 00:23:35,700
and i have to find the strength
to put it back together.

444
00:23:35,735 --> 00:23:38,236
so, that's why i came back tonight ...

445
00:23:38,271 --> 00:23:40,705
because i need something different,

446
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,042
and you are the first thing
i've laid eyes on that is.

447
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:48,346
and i have said too much. i'm sorry.

448
00:23:48,414 --> 00:23:50,815
you are.

449
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,484
what?

450
00:23:54,453 --> 00:23:58,557
earlier, you asked
me if you were pretty.

451
00:23:58,591 --> 00:24:00,058
you are.

452
00:24:04,297 --> 00:24:07,933
but it's your heart that
makes you more than that.

453
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:10,635
it makes you beautiful.

454
00:24:10,703 --> 00:24:13,438
thank you.

455
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:19,477
this is me.

456
00:24:19,512 --> 00:24:23,148
luke, no one knows about
dan loving my mother ...

457
00:24:23,182 --> 00:24:24,983
no one else in the world.

458
00:24:25,017 --> 00:24:28,053
just me, him, and now you.

459
00:24:28,087 --> 00:24:30,388
i won't say a word.

460
00:24:32,491 --> 00:24:36,061
you know, there's a sign
above the door in my bar.

461
00:24:36,128 --> 00:24:38,697
it reads, "people always leave... "

462
00:24:40,032 --> 00:24:45,036
"... but i say, 'stay a
while, have a nightcap'."

463
00:24:45,071 --> 00:24:47,873
now...

464
00:24:47,907 --> 00:24:51,076
maybe you and i can do that sometime.

465
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,544
leave?

466
00:24:52,612 --> 00:24:55,080
or have a nightcap?

467
00:24:55,114 --> 00:24:56,314
whatever you'd like.

468
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,120
would it be all right if ...

469
00:25:02,154 --> 00:25:03,355
just shut up and do it.

470
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:14,266
good night, peyton.

471
00:25:45,017 --> 00:25:46,150
well, this is a most romantic table ever reserved for me...

472
00:25:46,185 --> 00:25:48,286
and the most interesting of entrées.

473
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,357
penny for your thoughts.

474
00:25:54,793 --> 00:25:56,194
i love you.

475
00:25:56,228 --> 00:26:00,531
i always have ...  ever since
the first time i saw you.

476
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:02,967
i know this might sound crazy,

477
00:26:03,001 --> 00:26:06,504
but i just had to tell you, because...

478
00:26:06,538 --> 00:26:09,073
what?

479
00:26:09,107 --> 00:26:13,144
i'm not afraid of dying.

480
00:26:13,178 --> 00:26:14,512
but i am afraid of dying

481
00:26:14,546 --> 00:26:16,747
without you knowing
how i feel about you.

482
00:26:16,782 --> 00:26:18,416
you're not going to die, nathan scott.

483
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,151
you're going to come home...

484
00:26:20,219 --> 00:26:22,386
to me.

485
00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:23,988
i just think it's ...

486
00:26:30,629 --> 00:26:33,831
why don't you let me do the
thinking for the both of us?

487
00:26:35,734 --> 00:26:37,869
i've got a crazy idea.

488
00:26:37,903 --> 00:26:39,337
do you trust me?

489
00:26:39,371 --> 00:26:41,372
yes.

490
00:26:58,457 --> 00:26:58,489
you manage to find the money you owe me?

491
00:27:01,193 --> 00:27:05,730
no, but i have something
much more valuable than money.

492
00:27:05,764 --> 00:27:09,133
hey, boss, officer morello
will be here soon for his...

493
00:27:10,736 --> 00:27:13,404
appointment.

494
00:27:13,472 --> 00:27:15,173
hey, sugar.

495
00:27:16,975 --> 00:27:19,377
what could you possibly
have that i would want?

496
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:21,479
information...

497
00:27:21,513 --> 00:27:22,647
about peyton.

498
00:27:24,883 --> 00:27:26,984
what kind of information?

499
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:29,086
forgive my debt, and i'll tell you.

500
00:27:29,121 --> 00:27:31,923
no, you tell me, and i'll consider it.

501
00:27:31,957 --> 00:27:33,925
besides, you owe me money.

502
00:27:33,992 --> 00:27:36,327
you really don't have a choice.

503
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:39,630
what if i told you that
your precious peyton

504
00:27:39,665 --> 00:27:41,432
was sweet on lucas scott

505
00:27:41,466 --> 00:27:44,335
and that i saw them together last night?

506
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:45,937
i drove peyton home last night.

507
00:27:45,971 --> 00:27:47,605
besides, we've discussed this.

508
00:27:47,673 --> 00:27:50,041
she knows better than
to get involved with him.

509
00:27:50,075 --> 00:27:54,145
well, i saw it with my
own eyes late last night.

510
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:55,847
and i don't think she heard you,

511
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:57,715
unless you told her
it's okay to kiss him.

512
00:27:59,117 --> 00:28:01,219
you're lying.

513
00:28:01,253 --> 00:28:03,888
get her out of here.

514
00:28:10,495 --> 00:28:13,497
such a shame about peyton's mother...

515
00:28:13,532 --> 00:28:16,601
considering how you loved her.

516
00:28:16,635 --> 00:28:20,972
you consider my debt paid in full.

517
00:28:21,006 --> 00:28:23,074
hell hath no fury.

518
00:28:26,078 --> 00:28:27,311
pretty ruthless.

519
00:28:27,346 --> 00:28:30,515
there may be hope for
you yet, brooke davis.

520
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:33,184
then we're square.

521
00:28:33,252 --> 00:28:34,919
not yet.

522
00:28:37,055 --> 00:28:39,390
there's one more thing
you're gonna do for me.

523
00:28:45,631 --> 00:28:47,198
you need a lift?

524
00:28:48,233 --> 00:28:50,134
no, thanks.

525
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:53,037
you know, you could be
making a lot more money

526
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:54,205
at the comet club.

527
00:28:56,508 --> 00:28:59,010
i'm doing just fine at karen's.

528
00:28:59,044 --> 00:29:01,012
okay. all right.

529
00:29:01,046 --> 00:29:03,247
you're loyal. i get it.

530
00:29:03,282 --> 00:29:05,583
no hard feelings?

531
00:29:09,321 --> 00:29:11,389
then again, i wouldn't
call a piano player

532
00:29:11,423 --> 00:29:12,790
with a broken hand just fine.

533
00:29:16,595 --> 00:29:17,995
no!

534
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:23,534
hi.

535
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:25,269
didn't expect to see you here.

536
00:29:25,304 --> 00:29:26,204
i know.

537
00:29:28,173 --> 00:29:30,107
it might seem a little strange,

538
00:29:30,142 --> 00:29:33,244
but i would like for you to have this.

539
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:39,116
when i was a little girl, my
mother took me to a seaport.

540
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:42,086
we met a sailor, and he
took us out on the water.

541
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,589
i felt free.

542
00:29:44,623 --> 00:29:46,490
and when he brought
us back to the shore,

543
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:49,460
i cried, because i
didn't want to go home.

544
00:29:49,494 --> 00:29:52,830
and he told me that
one day, i would be free

545
00:29:52,898 --> 00:29:55,867
to see the world, to do as i pleased,

546
00:29:55,901 --> 00:29:58,569
but until that day, to keep the dove

547
00:29:58,604 --> 00:30:00,872
as a reminder of that dream.

548
00:30:00,939 --> 00:30:04,809
the dove has always
stood for peace and love.

549
00:30:04,843 --> 00:30:08,279
but for me, that dove has
always stood for freedom.

550
00:30:08,313 --> 00:30:10,648
i can't accept this.

551
00:30:10,682 --> 00:30:12,984
it comforts me, lucas.

552
00:30:13,018 --> 00:30:14,986
and so do you.

553
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,288
so i want you to have it.

554
00:30:20,492 --> 00:30:23,594
i should go.

555
00:30:23,629 --> 00:30:25,530
stay a while.

556
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:28,499
no.

557
00:30:28,534 --> 00:30:31,169
no, i think i'll hold
out till that nightcap.

558
00:30:34,706 --> 00:30:36,874
wouldn't want a girl to look too needy.

559
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:48,252
you had to be stubborn, huh?

560
00:30:52,457 --> 00:30:54,926
you couldn't just look the other way

561
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,061
and take my handouts.

562
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,066
look at you ...

563
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,036
sitting there, all strong and proud,

564
00:31:05,103 --> 00:31:07,738
not even begging for your life.

565
00:31:11,143 --> 00:31:14,445
wow, you really take
the pleasure out of this.

566
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:16,948
it kind of reminds me of keith scott.

567
00:31:21,186 --> 00:31:22,386
oh, well.

568
00:31:24,156 --> 00:31:25,323
i'll get over it.

569
00:31:37,002 --> 00:31:38,803
hiya.

570
00:31:43,156 --> 00:31:45,490
here, have another drink, boozy.

571
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:49,995
you should have stuck to gossip columns

572
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:52,197
instea where you don't belong.

573
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:57,235
gossip columns won't
get you killed, kid.

574
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,937
boss? stop it!

575
00:31:58,971 --> 00:32:00,572
what is this?!

576
00:32:00,606 --> 00:32:02,574
get off me.

577
00:32:02,608 --> 00:32:03,942
what are you doing here?

578
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,243
all this time...

579
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:08,146
i didn't want to believe
that you were evil,

580
00:32:08,181 --> 00:32:09,715
that you were a liar.

581
00:32:09,749 --> 00:32:12,718
but i think i knew all along,

582
00:32:12,752 --> 00:32:14,219
so i followed you.

583
00:32:14,253 --> 00:32:16,254
and what about you?

584
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:18,390
how's lucas doing, whore?

585
00:32:18,424 --> 00:32:21,560
he killed lucas' uncle keith.

586
00:32:21,594 --> 00:32:23,161
i said i was onto
something, and i was right.

587
00:32:23,196 --> 00:32:24,196
he murdered him.

588
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,764
shut him up!

589
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:27,265
is that true?

590
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,500
go wait in the car.

591
00:32:28,568 --> 00:32:30,502
is that true?!

592
00:32:30,536 --> 00:32:32,204
go wait in the car!

593
00:32:35,575 --> 00:32:37,376
go wait in the car.

594
00:32:44,484 --> 00:32:45,450
no.

595
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:46,485
no!

596
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:47,552
no!

597
00:32:51,624 --> 00:32:55,093
"i want a dress, nice and pale"

598
00:32:55,128 --> 00:32:57,062
"with hat on the top"

599
00:32:57,096 --> 00:32:58,630
what are you thinking about?

600
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:03,135
the house we're going to live
in right here in tree hill city.

601
00:33:03,169 --> 00:33:04,703
anything else?

602
00:33:04,737 --> 00:33:08,874
well, since the house
is going to be so big,

603
00:33:08,941 --> 00:33:11,443
i suppose we'll need children.

604
00:33:13,112 --> 00:33:16,048
a little girl, just like you.

605
00:33:16,082 --> 00:33:18,817
mnh-mnh, a son.

606
00:33:18,851 --> 00:33:22,154
we could name him
james, like haley james.

607
00:33:22,188 --> 00:33:23,655
jamie.

608
00:33:23,723 --> 00:33:24,523
yeah.

609
00:33:24,557 --> 00:33:28,060
"i wanna get married"

610
00:33:28,094 --> 00:33:34,633
"wanna be
mrs. s-c-o-t-t"

611
00:33:40,773 --> 00:33:42,307
well, well.

612
00:33:42,341 --> 00:33:45,510
the boozy reporter
finally cracks the case.

613
00:33:45,545 --> 00:33:46,878
well done.

614
00:33:46,913 --> 00:33:50,348
i'll tell you what...

615
00:33:50,383 --> 00:33:52,384
i'm a charitable guy.

616
00:33:52,418 --> 00:33:53,685
you beg for your life,

617
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,754
and just maybe i'll set you free.

618
00:33:55,788 --> 00:33:57,122
no.

619
00:33:57,156 --> 00:33:59,691
i'm not crawling anymore
... not even for you.

620
00:33:59,726 --> 00:34:02,194
and pretty soon, no
one else will, either.

621
00:34:02,228 --> 00:34:04,629
they'll find out that you killed keith,

622
00:34:04,664 --> 00:34:05,897
just like i did.

623
00:34:05,932 --> 00:34:08,333
and then they'll bring you down.

624
00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:13,205
oh, i'd say if anyone's
going down, it's you.

625
00:34:22,515 --> 00:34:25,484
hey, mouth, be a friend and
get that for me, will you?

626
00:34:42,835 --> 00:34:45,971
that last drink's on me.

627
00:34:46,005 --> 00:34:47,939
boss, peyton's gone.

628
00:34:52,812 --> 00:34:53,979
hey, skills.

629
00:34:54,013 --> 00:34:55,514
play something good for me?

630
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,352
what happened to you?

631
00:35:00,386 --> 00:35:02,587
julian, dan.

632
00:35:04,323 --> 00:35:06,158
they have mouth. they're gonna kill him.

633
00:35:06,192 --> 00:35:07,159
what?

634
00:35:07,226 --> 00:35:09,327
he found out that dan killed keith.

635
00:35:09,362 --> 00:35:12,397
luke, i didn't know. i'm sorry.

636
00:35:12,432 --> 00:35:14,299
luke, what are you doing?

637
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:16,735
luke, we can be free.

638
00:35:16,769 --> 00:35:18,303
we can leave tonight.

639
00:35:18,337 --> 00:35:19,604
luke, listen to her.

640
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:21,139
he knows she's here.

641
00:35:21,174 --> 00:35:22,607
you're gonna get hurt.

642
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:24,743
he hurt me when he
took keith away from me.

643
00:35:24,777 --> 00:35:26,878
he's hurt everybody, including you.

644
00:35:26,913 --> 00:35:28,680
somebody needs to stop him.

645
00:35:28,748 --> 00:35:30,415
lucas.

646
00:35:30,483 --> 00:35:31,650
were you serious when you told me

647
00:35:31,684 --> 00:35:32,584
you'd leave with me tonight?

648
00:35:32,618 --> 00:35:34,086
yes.

649
00:35:35,321 --> 00:35:37,689
skills, you've been a good
man and a great friend,

650
00:35:37,724 --> 00:35:39,291
so i want you to have this place.

651
00:35:39,325 --> 00:35:40,492
it's yours.

652
00:35:40,526 --> 00:35:42,294
i'm coming, too. no.

653
00:35:42,328 --> 00:35:44,362
you'd just hold me up anyway.

654
00:35:54,941 --> 00:35:55,741
luke!

655
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:36,161
<i>these duracell batteries were given...</i>

656
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:08,153
get over here, peyton.

657
00:36:08,187 --> 00:36:10,021
peyton, now!

658
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:11,289
she's with me.

659
00:36:23,769 --> 00:36:27,672
why does everything
always have to be so messy?

660
00:36:32,144 --> 00:36:34,913
okay, okay.

661
00:36:34,947 --> 00:36:38,283
<i>not even i'd shoot a
man in the back, lucas.</i>

662
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:39,451
actually, that's not true.

663
00:36:39,485 --> 00:36:40,985
i've shot several men in the back.

664
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,120
most of them deserved it,

665
00:36:42,188 --> 00:36:44,789
<i>but i wouldn't recommend you do it,</i>

666
00:36:44,824 --> 00:36:46,958
'cause i have a surprise for you.

667
00:36:48,327 --> 00:36:49,360
ms. davis?

668
00:37:03,476 --> 00:37:05,043
put it down.

669
00:37:05,077 --> 00:37:07,679
that's a good boy.

670
00:37:07,713 --> 00:37:09,280
isn't this fun?

671
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:16,454
okay, ms. davis, finish your
job and your debt is clear.

672
00:37:16,489 --> 00:37:19,424
i'm sorry, luke.

673
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:23,528
brooke, we've all had hard times.

674
00:37:23,562 --> 00:37:25,363
you don't have to do this.

675
00:37:25,431 --> 00:37:27,799
yes, i do.

676
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:30,869
i should have done this a long time ago.

677
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:38,543
yeah, i thought so.

678
00:37:38,577 --> 00:37:39,778
women.

679
00:37:45,518 --> 00:37:48,286
you want something done right ...

680
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:04,202
luke.

681
00:38:07,773 --> 00:38:09,507
peyton?

682
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:13,378
i got you, i got you.

683
00:38:13,412 --> 00:38:15,346
hey, come on.

684
00:38:15,381 --> 00:38:16,514
no, it's gonna be okay.

685
00:38:16,549 --> 00:38:19,150
hold on, hold on, hold
on. you're gonna be okay.

686
00:38:19,185 --> 00:38:21,286
hey, we're gonna leave, remember?

687
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,122
yeah. just you and me
... we're gonna leave.

688
00:38:24,156 --> 00:38:25,590
come on.

689
00:38:25,624 --> 00:38:27,726
i love you.

690
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,016
"don't fight, don't fight,
don't fight, don't fight"

691
00:38:52,051 --> 00:38:55,320
"don't do it again"

692
00:38:55,388 --> 00:38:57,422
i'm coming back to you, haley. i am.

693
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,990
is that a promise?

694
00:38:59,024 --> 00:39:01,092
as long as you wait for me, it is.

695
00:39:01,127 --> 00:39:03,461
oh, i'll wait for you.

696
00:39:03,496 --> 00:39:06,164
i'll wait forever.

697
00:39:06,232 --> 00:39:10,235
"don't say, don't say,
don't say, don't say"

698
00:39:10,302 --> 00:39:14,672
"you're leaving this town"

699
00:39:16,742 --> 00:39:19,244
best day of my life.

700
00:39:19,278 --> 00:39:24,983
"you're all i have in this life"

701
00:39:25,017 --> 00:39:29,788
"don't..."

702
00:39:29,822 --> 00:39:34,325
"and hear me out"

703
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:39,064
"don't fool"

704
00:39:39,098 --> 00:39:43,702
"just hold me now"

705
00:39:43,736 --> 00:39:47,172
"don't take, don't take, don't take"

706
00:39:47,206 --> 00:39:53,411
"don't take it so lightly"

707
00:39:53,446 --> 00:39:56,715
"when you say, you say, you say"

708
00:39:56,749 --> 00:39:59,884
"when you say you love me"

709
00:40:02,621 --> 00:40:07,492
"i miss, i miss, i miss, i miss"

710
00:40:07,526 --> 00:40:09,894
"the way we would laugh"

711
00:40:12,498 --> 00:40:15,200
"i wish, i wish, i wish..."

712
00:40:15,234 --> 00:40:17,469
you're free now, peyton.

713
00:40:17,503 --> 00:40:21,806
"... that we could go back"

714
00:40:21,841 --> 00:40:26,845
"when you say, you say, you say"

715
00:40:26,879 --> 00:40:32,817
"when you say you love me"

716
00:40:53,806 --> 00:40:55,607
peyton?

717
00:40:55,674 --> 00:40:57,675
hi. did i wake you up?

718
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,877
no.

719
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,014
