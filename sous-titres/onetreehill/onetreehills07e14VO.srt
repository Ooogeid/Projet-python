<i>Previously on One Tree Hill...</i>

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:04,100
You are heading down
a dangerous pass.

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,485
You don't have a job.

4
00:00:05,568 --> 00:00:06,453
Your honor...

5
00:00:06,536 --> 00:00:07,936
She does have a job.

6
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,489
She works for me.

7
00:00:09,572 --> 00:00:11,372
How did we get the funding
for the movie?

8
00:00:11,508 --> 00:00:14,724
My father and I put up the money,
because I believe in you.

9
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:16,983
All day long
I've been trying to figure out

10
00:00:17,066 --> 00:00:19,959
How to get past
the you-and-alex thing.

11
00:00:20,042 --> 00:00:21,800
Maybe right now,
you need to work on u,

12
00:00:21,883 --> 00:00:23,547
And I need to work on me.

13
00:00:24,114 --> 00:00:25,510
Goodbye, brooke.

14
00:00:25,593 --> 00:00:26,789
Hey, tay.

15
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,277
You remember...

16
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,018
I prefer to call him
my new boyfriend.

Sync by fant0m www.addic7ed.com

18
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:56,927
Haley, stop!

19
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:57,732
Sorry.

20
00:00:57,815 --> 00:00:59,074
Just trying to wake
taylor and david.

21
00:00:59,157 --> 00:01:00,179
I'm sure you did,

22
00:01:00,262 --> 00:01:01,849
Alonth the rest of the neighborhood.

23
00:01:01,932 --> 00:01:03,257
How long have you been up?

24
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,728
Since I dreamt that my sister

25
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:06,470
Was screwing
my other sister's husband.

26
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:07,875
Ex-husband.

27
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:09,718
Did you dream that, to
that'so weird.

28
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:11,072
Did I kill them in yours?

29
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:12,632
No, actually, you played it cool.

30
00:01:12,715 --> 00:01:13,937
Well, then you really were dreaming,

31
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,683
Because there's no way
to play this cool.

32
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:17,815
This is the most uncool thing
taylor's ever done.

33
00:01:17,898 --> 00:01:19,463
Morning, kids.

34
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,100
Good morning, slut.

35
00:01:21,183 --> 00:01:22,835
You can get your things and go.

36
00:01:22,918 --> 00:01:24,103
What's wrong?

37
00:01:24,186 --> 00:01:25,686
Are you still mad
about me and david?

38
00:01:25,787 --> 00:01:27,174
That's so last night.

39
00:01:27,257 --> 00:01:29,348
You like that outfit enough
to get buried in,

40
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:31,337
Or you want to go put something on?

41
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,413
Why? It's nothing
hehasn't seen before.

42
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,261
But if you insist.

43
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:45,263
Come... are you
gonna say something?!

44
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:46,314
"I love you"?

45
00:01:47,518 --> 00:01:49,211
Good morning!

46
00:01:49,294 --> 00:01:50,512
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

47
00:01:50,595 --> 00:01:51,515
We're late for the video-game shoot.

48
00:01:51,598 --> 00:01:52,851
Better get going.

49
00:01:52,934 --> 00:01:54,123
Have a good day, hales.
Love you.

50
00:01:54,206 --> 00:01:55,039
Bye, mom.

51
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,970
This house is perfect for the movie.

52
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,311
How were you able to get it
for free?

53
00:02:02,394 --> 00:02:04,398
What can I say?
I'a great producer.

54
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:08,374
No, it's lucas' house.
He said we could use it.

55
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,836
How's rehearsal going
with alex duprÃƒÂ©?

56
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:16,860
I see she and peter are...

57
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:20,120
I think it's important
for a director and actor

58
00:02:20,203 --> 00:02:22,507
To establish boundaries early on.

59
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,733
I know he's a little
high-maintenance,

60
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:27,337
But the guy's talented.

61
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,006
Besides, the clock was ticking,

62
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:30,598
And we didn't have much of a budget.

63
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:31,776
Alex.

64
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:34,085
Alex Dupré, this is my father,
paul norris.

65
00:02:34,168 --> 00:02:36,314
It's nice to finally meet you, paul.

66
00:02:36,397 --> 00:02:37,789
Nice to meet you, too, alex.

67
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:39,488
I've seen u in the trades.

68
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:41,669
I've seen you in the tabloids.

69
00:02:41,752 --> 00:02:43,205
That was the old me.

70
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,941
Good...
I shouldn't have to tell you

71
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:47,347
How important this film is
to both julian and myself.

72
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,052
You don't have to worry about
her, dad. She's here to work.

73
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:51,804
Yep.
I'm a professional.

74
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,626
You're certainly dressed like one.

75
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:55,129
Oh, thank you.

76
00:02:55,212 --> 00:02:57,553
I picked it out myself since we
don't have a wardrobe person.

77
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:00,087
Could we get to work, please?
Bye.

78
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:04,749
I haven't hired
a costume designer yet.

79
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,085
Why not?

80
00:03:06,168 --> 00:03:08,973
The person I wanted didn't work out.

81
00:03:12,115 --> 00:03:14,371
Dare I ask what's in the box?

82
00:03:14,454 --> 00:03:17,359
You're staring at it like
someone sent you a severed head.

83
00:03:19,096 --> 00:03:21,352
It's julian's stuff.

84
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:24,425
He broke up with me last night.

85
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:28,047
Oh, honey, I'm sorry, dear.

86
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:36,264
A head would have been
an improvement.

87
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:39,889
I want to take it to him,

88
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:42,662
But I just don't think
I can see him right now.

89
00:03:42,745 --> 00:03:45,901
And I really don't want to see alex.

90
00:03:45,984 --> 00:03:47,638
Even if herhead were severed?

91
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:50,510
Stop talking about severed heads!

92
00:03:50,593 --> 00:03:53,015
Okay, how abou I take care
of the box?

93
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:54,193
Okay?

94
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,087
I mean, we run
a multimillion-dollar company.

95
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,690
I'm sure we can afford a courier.

96
00:03:57,773 --> 00:04:00,311
There's no need
for unnecessary drama.

97
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:08,507
Before I forget,

98
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,176
Millicent is working with us again.

99
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:12,629
Shll be in this morning.

100
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:25,980
So much for our security deposit.

101
00:04:26,063 --> 00:04:27,680
Sorry about the mess.

102
00:04:27,763 --> 00:04:30,750
I'll clean it
when I get back from work.

103
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:35,251
I'm not worried about the place.
I'm worried about you.

104
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:36,400
Are you okay?

105
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:40,801
Not really, but I'm trying.

106
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,370
Have you thought about
going back to rehab?

107
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:49,591
Yeah, I've thought about it.

108
00:04:49,674 --> 00:04:52,508
Well, leme know if there's
anything I can do to hp.

109
00:04:58,547 --> 00:05:00,900
How long are you staying?

110
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:04,837
I'm not sure.
Maybe...A day or two?

111
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,406
But you'll be here when I get home?

112
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:09,307
Yeah.

113
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,690
That helps.

114
00:05:23,705 --> 00:05:24,957
Come on.

115
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,793
You cannot expect me
to honestly believe

116
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:28,961
That thisthing
between the two of you

117
00:05:29,044 --> 00:05:30,929
Is anything more
than some sick joke.

118
00:05:31,012 --> 00:05:32,097
What's so sick about it?

119
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,264
David's a great guy.

120
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:35,199
Quinn couldn't see it.
I can.

121
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:37,067
Can't you just be happy for us?

122
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,602
You know what would make me happy,

123
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:40,070
Is throwing you out a window.

124
00:05:40,153 --> 00:05:42,272
But I'm gonna settle for you
using the front door.

125
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:44,040
That's no way to treat your sister

126
00:05:44,123 --> 00:05:46,491
And possible
two-time brother-in-law.

127
00:05:48,227 --> 00:05:49,912
Good morning, haley.

128
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:52,515
"Good morning."
Yeah, don't "morning" me, david.

129
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:54,984
You will have to forgive my sister.

130
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:56,552
She's cranky this morning.

131
00:05:56,635 --> 00:05:58,503
Hopefully, she'll be
in a better mood tonight.

132
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:02,992
David and I are cooking dinner
for everyone tonight.

133
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:05,161
No, that's not happening!
You can't...

134
00:06:05,244 --> 00:06:07,729
That's not happening...
not tonight, not ever.

135
00:06:07,812 --> 00:06:09,663
Why not?
Quinn already agreed to it.

136
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:11,879
I'll see you tonight.

137
00:06:14,313 --> 00:06:15,346
David!

138
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,502
How can you do this to quinn?

139
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:22,753
It's no worse
than what she did to me.

140
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:27,041
I told them we spt together.

141
00:06:27,124 --> 00:06:29,258
What?

142
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,979
So, now you want me to go
to dinner with your ex,

143
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:35,914
Who probably wants to kill me,

144
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:38,249
And your sister,
who's obviously insane?

145
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:39,450
Yeah, it's okay.

146
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,085
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

147
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:43,187
I just...
I don't get it.

148
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,888
I know why david wants to hurt you,

149
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,172
But why would your own sister
go along with it?

150
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,259
You have to know taylor.

151
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:52,661
When we were kids, she tried
stealing my boyfriends.

152
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:55,130
And now she's after my ex-husband.

153
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:57,599
So, I guess she never grew up.

154
00:06:57,682 --> 00:06:59,282
And that doesn't bother you?

155
00:07:01,952 --> 00:07:05,052
A little, but not nearly as much
as that does.

156
00:07:22,648 --> 00:07:24,882
See, how cool is your dad?

157
00:07:26,952 --> 00:07:28,370
I mean, not now, of course,

158
00:07:28,453 --> 00:07:30,606
But he is gonna look great
in this new video game.

159
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:32,023
When do I get to play?

160
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,576
Well, the game won't be ready
for a month,

161
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:37,558
But we shod be able to get you
a prototype to play tonight.

162
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:41,613
You look good covered in balls.

163
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:43,714
Now I know how taylor feels.

164
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,449
Hey, speaking of, I, uh...

165
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,217
Take it you heard
about this dinner tonight?

166
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,852
Yes.

167
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,420
I got a very angry text message
from my wife.

168
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:51,821
You coming?

169
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,957
No, I, uh, think I have
some work to catch up on.

170
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,325
Quinn's okay with that?

171
00:07:56,408 --> 00:07:57,760
I mean, if haley's this pissed,

172
00:07:57,843 --> 00:07:59,628
I can't imagine how upset
quinn must be.

173
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:01,596
It's strange, but she seems okay.

174
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:03,831
She was more upset
by kylie showing up

175
00:08:03,914 --> 00:08:05,800
For a swim in my pool this morning.

176
00:08:05,883 --> 00:08:07,268
Who is kylie?!

177
00:08:07,351 --> 00:08:10,904
Some chick who took a whore bath
in clay's pool this morning.

178
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:12,638
My god, quinn, that's awful.

179
00:08:12,721 --> 00:08:15,373
Must just make you
want to rip david's head off

180
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:17,641
And punch taylor
right in her fat face.

181
00:08:17,724 --> 00:08:19,176
You shouldn't let them get to you.

182
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,812
How are they not getting to you?

183
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:22,514
David has a right to be upset
with me,

184
00:08:22,597 --> 00:08:24,181
And taylor'slways been a bitch.

185
00:08:24,264 --> 00:08:25,782
So what do you want me to do?

186
00:08:25,865 --> 00:08:28,919
Uh, I don't know, say no
when they invite you to dinner.

187
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:30,654
Clay makes me happy, haley!

188
00:08:30,737 --> 00:08:32,422
Why shouldn't david be happy?

189
00:08:32,505 --> 00:08:35,457
I mean, I can't imagine that
Taylor is the one for him,

190
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,292
But if she is, I'll deal with it.

191
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,127
Just like that?

192
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,962
If they want to throw
their relationship in my face,

193
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:42,930
I have to let them know
it doesn't bother me, right?

194
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:44,866
No! Not right!
And let me tell you something.

195
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:46,335
If nathan and I got divorced

196
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:48,271
And he and taylor showed up
playing kissy-face,

197
00:08:48,354 --> 00:08:50,074
Not only would I never
see them again,

198
00:08:50,157 --> 00:08:51,609
Nobody else would, either.

199
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:54,826
So you're saying I should kill them.

200
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:57,813
I mean, it's a little extreme,
don't you think?

201
00:08:57,896 --> 00:08:58,996
No, you're right.

202
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,584
Having dinner with them
is so much more sane.

203
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,867
See you tonight.

204
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:12,243
How you holding up today?

205
00:09:16,248 --> 00:09:17,533
Still upset, I see.

206
00:09:17,616 --> 00:09:19,134
"Clothes over psychos"

207
00:09:19,217 --> 00:09:21,452
Coming this fall
to prisons everywhere.

208
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:24,222
Hey, brooke.

209
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,875
Alexander coyne.

210
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,858
Millicent huxtable.
Nice to meet you.

211
00:09:32,294 --> 00:09:34,380
Do you need help with anything?

212
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,548
Just ask victoria...

213
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:39,099
'cause you work for her.

214
00:09:44,237 --> 00:09:46,222
Wow.
You're a mean boss.

215
00:09:46,305 --> 00:09:47,657
You're like an evil disney character

216
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,607
Who feeds her servants porridge
and pays them in buttons.

217
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:06,640
Lauren. Hi.
What are you doing here?

218
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:07,708
Hey, I just talked to antwon.

219
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,277
He said you were back in town.

220
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,913
Oh, looks like
you had one hell of a party.

221
00:10:11,996 --> 00:10:12,980
I'm sorry I missed it.

222
00:10:13,063 --> 00:10:14,281
Yeah, I missed it, too.

223
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,231
But, uh, at least I get to clean it.

224
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:18,518
Do you want some help?

225
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:21,053
Come on, we can pretend we're csi

226
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:22,720
And re-create what happened.

227
00:10:22,803 --> 00:10:24,422
I don't think I want to know.

228
00:10:24,505 --> 00:10:26,123
Oh, come on.
It'll be fun.

229
00:10:26,206 --> 00:10:28,158
First one who finds the couch wins?

230
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:28,974
All right.

231
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,066
Can chuck come over
and play the new game tonight?

232
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:38,470
Yeah, of course.
You two are friends again?

233
00:10:38,553 --> 00:10:40,439
Yeah. We homies.
See?

234
00:10:40,522 --> 00:10:41,874
Sometimes friends, they fight,

235
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:44,243
They get mad at each other,
but then they make up.

236
00:10:44,326 --> 00:10:47,213
Like mom, aunt quinn,
and aunt taylor?

237
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:48,947
Exactly. They're mad
at each other now,

238
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,597
But eventually it'll blow over.

239
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:57,587
Hey, what's going on?

240
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,188
Well, let's see taylor
try and cook dinner

241
00:10:59,271 --> 00:11:00,338
With no pots and pans.

242
00:11:04,443 --> 00:11:06,544
You and chuck play upstairs tonight.

243
00:11:13,283 --> 00:11:15,702
I can't find alex.
Have you seen her?

244
00:11:15,785 --> 00:11:18,186
Have you checked your hand?
It's usually on her ass.

245
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:21,139
What do you need her for, anyway?

246
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,074
I want to put my hand on her ass.

247
00:11:23,157 --> 00:11:25,777
Why don't you just leave her
alone and let her act?

248
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,677
What's the point of being
in a movie with alex duprÃƒÂ©

249
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,978
If I don't get to sleep with her?

250
00:11:29,061 --> 00:11:30,913
The point is that
she's a great actress

251
00:11:30,996 --> 00:11:32,747
Who wrote an amazing script.

252
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,484
Oh, sure, but it doesn't hurt that she's
gone down more times than the sun.

253
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:38,270
If you see her,
tell her I'm in my trailer.

254
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:45,209
Brooke thought you
might want your stuff back.

255
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:49,179
Sorry, man.

256
00:11:57,505 --> 00:11:59,824
I don't appreciate
you sending your boy toy

257
00:11:59,907 --> 00:12:01,192
To deliver my stuff.

258
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:03,326
W...
well, I don't appreciate

259
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:05,428
The dumping you delivered
to me last night,

260
00:12:05,511 --> 00:12:06,596
So I guess we're even.

261
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,464
Oh, come on, brooke.

262
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:08,766
You broke up with me when you left.

263
00:12:08,849 --> 00:12:10,933
I just had the nerve
to call it what it was.

264
00:12:11,016 --> 00:12:13,201
And I didn't need to send
an alex to do it for me.

265
00:12:13,284 --> 00:12:15,318
I just needed some space!

266
00:12:17,422 --> 00:12:20,191
Well, you got it.

267
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:38,389
Hey, there.

268
00:12:38,472 --> 00:12:41,625
Oh. It's me, by the way... Quinn.

269
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,026
Just in case you were wondering.

270
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:44,328
I mean, you never know
who's gonna stop by

271
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:45,497
For a swim, right?

272
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,799
I'm sorry about this morning, quinn.

273
00:12:47,882 --> 00:12:49,933
I didn't know she was coming over,

274
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:51,634
And it won't happen again.

275
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:54,319
Just her or all the others, too?

276
00:12:56,122 --> 00:12:57,874
I don't know who you think I am.

277
00:12:57,957 --> 00:13:00,409
I know exactly who you are.

278
00:13:00,492 --> 00:13:02,177
Maybe who I used to be.

279
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,212
It's okay.

280
00:13:04,295 --> 00:13:06,114
It's only been a couple of months.

281
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:08,282
I can't expect y
to be a different person.

282
00:13:08,365 --> 00:13:10,150
No. But you can expect me

283
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:13,619
To be the type of guy
that you can count on.

284
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:15,720
I'm coming with you tonight.

285
00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:17,289
Really?

286
00:13:17,372 --> 00:13:18,504
Yeah.

287
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:22,826
Wow, I didn't see that one coming.

288
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:25,910
You know what else
you didn't see coming?

289
00:13:37,285 --> 00:13:38,869
What are you doing?

290
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:41,205
I'm spoiling my appetite.

291
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,141
Haley, if you're so against
this dinner,

292
00:13:43,224 --> 00:13:45,142
Then why did you agree to it?

293
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,776
It's a bad idea.

294
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,610
Of course it's a bad idea.
It's a terrible idea.

295
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:50,814
But if quinn and taylor
say I should be fine,

296
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,148
I'm gonna be fine.

297
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,549
You seem fine.
Oh, I am.

298
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,484
I'm gonna sit at dinner
like a perfect little angel.

299
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:57,485
And I'm gonna say,
"oh, that's so nice, taylor."

300
00:13:57,568 --> 00:13:59,887
"Um, taylor,
that's a really funny story."

301
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,822
"Would you please pass
the potatoes, taylor?"

302
00:14:01,905 --> 00:14:04,173
Only there won't be any potatoes.

303
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:10,665
Hey, brooke! S'up?

304
00:14:10,748 --> 00:14:11,815
Hi.

305
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:15,369
I was just feeling a little lost,

306
00:14:15,452 --> 00:14:19,220
So I thought I'd come see
the most stable couple I know.

307
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:26,777
The suspect started here,

308
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,344
But he couldn't hold his liquor,

309
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:30,312
So he stashed the wounded soldier

310
00:14:30,395 --> 00:14:32,080
And made a mad dash
for the bathroom.

311
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,447
How would you know that?

312
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,963
Splatterattern.

313
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:38,683
Looks like he projectiled
from over here.

314
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:39,918
That is really gross.

315
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:41,801
Yeah.
You can clean that up.

316
00:14:47,372 --> 00:14:49,724
So, are you here for good,
or is this just a visit?

317
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:50,858
Uh, I'm not sure.

318
00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:52,092
I really only left

319
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:53,460
'cause millie and I
were having problems.

320
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:54,796
I thought it would do me some good.

321
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,279
You know, out of sight, out of mind.

322
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,633
Did it work?

323
00:14:57,716 --> 00:14:59,203
No.

324
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:00,589
She was just out of sight.

325
00:15:03,425 --> 00:15:05,026
I'll clean the vomit.

326
00:15:08,163 --> 00:15:10,314
That makes me sick!
Taylor is awful!

327
00:15:10,397 --> 00:15:11,949
I thought alex was a bitch.

328
00:15:12,032 --> 00:15:13,516
Ye, I know, right?

329
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:14,851
And don't worry about alex.

330
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:16,384
Julian obviously still loves you.

331
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:17,986
Brooke, he stayed in tree hill
to make his movie.

332
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:19,888
Yeah, well, heade it
very clear today

333
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:21,289
That he does not want
to see me anymore.

334
00:15:21,372 --> 00:15:22,760
He is probably just upset.

335
00:15:22,843 --> 00:15:25,396
You guys are way too good
together not to make it.

336
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:26,664
Just give it some time.

337
00:15:26,747 --> 00:15:28,533
Okay.

338
00:15:28,616 --> 00:15:30,383
Fine.

339
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:33,237
Don't worry
about this dinner tonight.

340
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,273
You know, it's gonna be over
before you know it.

341
00:15:35,356 --> 00:15:37,442
Actually, nathan's betting
we don't make it through dinner.

342
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:39,043
He said he thinks
I'm gonna attack taylor

343
00:15:39,126 --> 00:15:40,044
Before the salad is served.

344
00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:41,745
Well, can you blame him?

345
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:44,948
You've been arrested more times
than anyone I know, "jailey."

346
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:46,431
I hate my name.

347
00:15:50,202 --> 00:15:53,655
Let the wild rumpus start.

348
00:15:53,738 --> 00:15:55,057
Thanks, hales.

349
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,007
You'll be okay.

350
00:15:58,442 --> 00:16:01,110
Enjoy your last supper, judas.

351
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,797
If you're going to act
like a porn star,

352
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,732
The least you could do is
take your bloody clothes off!

353
00:16:07,815 --> 00:16:11,203
Oh, oh, hold on.
Okay, alex, come he.

354
00:16:11,286 --> 00:16:14,305
We're in the middle
of rehearsal here.

355
00:16:14,388 --> 00:16:15,673
Are you okay?
No.

356
00:16:15,756 --> 00:16:17,041
He keeps hitting on me.

357
00:16:17,124 --> 00:16:18,542
And when I wouldn't say hello
to his "little friend,"

358
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,077
He got mad and said
I wasn't right for the part.

359
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,713
I think he's trying to make me quit.

360
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:25,630
Okay, I'll take care of it.
Just do your best.

361
00:16:27,433 --> 00:16:28,951
Could you do me a favor, peter?

362
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:30,853
I'm not big on favors.
Oh.

363
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:32,320
Okay, then, I'll make it an order.

364
00:16:32,403 --> 00:16:33,520
Take it easy on alex.

365
00:16:33,603 --> 00:16:35,588
Maybe you could give her
some direction

366
00:16:35,671 --> 00:16:36,971
Instead of just yelling at her.

367
00:16:38,173 --> 00:16:40,174
Whatever you say, boss.

368
00:16:41,943 --> 00:16:43,310
Let's take it from the top.

369
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:50,567
Chuck's here, buddy.

370
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,602
So, where's this brand-new game
that's not even out yet?

371
00:16:53,685 --> 00:16:56,505
Right here.
It's really cool.

372
00:16:56,588 --> 00:16:58,822
We'll see.
I get to be your dad.

373
00:17:00,558 --> 00:17:02,610
Nice to have you back, chuck.

374
00:17:02,693 --> 00:17:04,194
Whatever.

375
00:17:06,063 --> 00:17:07,815
You're not using
the good silverware?

376
00:17:07,898 --> 00:17:09,449
Good silverware is for good people.

377
00:17:09,532 --> 00:17:11,952
They're lucki'm not making
them eat off the floor.

378
00:17:12,035 --> 00:17:13,435
Are you gonna be civil tonight?

379
00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:17,790
Just try, haley, please.
It's only one night.

380
00:17:17,873 --> 00:17:20,025
Look, we've weathered
dan's crap for years.

381
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:21,475
This should be easy.

382
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,843
Got it!

383
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:34,771
You must be quinn's boyfriend.

384
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:37,355
And you must be her crazy sister.

385
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,111
I'm not crazy.

386
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:45,647
I love him.

387
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,383
He's all I ever dream about,

388
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,952
And I dot care
if anybody else gets that.

389
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:52,921
So I'm going back to him.

390
00:17:53,004 --> 00:17:55,523
That's awful!
Just awful!

391
00:17:55,606 --> 00:17:57,674
Can't you do anything right?

392
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:00,427
Obviously not.

393
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,543
Cut deeper next time.

394
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:06,581
How's that fodirection?

395
00:18:08,683 --> 00:18:11,885
When he comes to,
tell him he's fired.

396
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:20,611
Okay, let's get this over with.

397
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:22,512
Can we say grace first?

398
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:23,997
You're religious now?

399
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,432
Well, I have been calling out

400
00:18:25,515 --> 00:18:26,816
God's name a lot lately.

401
00:18:29,952 --> 00:18:33,668
Thank you, God,
for my wonderful family,

402
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:36,203
For the food
that we're about to receive...

403
00:18:36,286 --> 00:18:38,138
And for david.

404
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:39,940
His chest...

405
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:42,090
Strong arms...

406
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:44,844
...Home theater...

407
00:18:44,927 --> 00:18:47,595
Oh, she does love the home theater.

408
00:18:50,598 --> 00:18:51,449
Amen.

409
00:18:51,532 --> 00:18:52,464
Amen.

410
00:18:53,295 --> 00:18:54,299
Amen!

411
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,828
Amen.

412
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,626
How's your hand?

413
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,344
Better than his head.

414
00:19:07,612 --> 00:19:09,430
Thanks for sticking up for me.

415
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:11,999
You've had to do that a lot lately.

416
00:19:12,082 --> 00:19:14,717
I'm pretty sure nobody thinks
I can do this movie.

417
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:19,405
Since when do you give a crap
about what anybody else thinks?

418
00:19:19,488 --> 00:19:21,055
It's just...

419
00:19:22,457 --> 00:19:24,225
...What if I screw up?

420
00:19:30,365 --> 00:19:32,050
You won't.

421
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:34,518
Have some faith in yourself.

422
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:35,986
I do.

423
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:37,988
I won't let you down.

424
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:39,871
I know.

425
00:19:51,282 --> 00:19:52,633
What was I saying?

426
00:19:52,716 --> 00:19:55,470
You said, "watch this."

427
00:19:55,553 --> 00:19:58,139
So, uh, I think we're all curious.

428
00:19:58,222 --> 00:20:00,207
How exactly did you two
get together?

429
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,910
Glad you asked.

430
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,078
It was just another boring d
at the gym

431
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,713
When who should accidentally

432
00:20:05,796 --> 00:20:07,730
Walk into my
stripper aerobics class?

433
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:11,317
David.

434
00:20:12,534 --> 00:20:14,053
Quinny's got herself a smart one.

435
00:20:14,136 --> 00:20:16,488
Yes. David.

436
00:20:16,571 --> 00:20:18,356
He was so embarrassed to leave,

437
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:20,192
He stayed the entire class.

438
00:20:20,275 --> 00:20:22,493
And it was quite a workout.

439
00:20:22,576 --> 00:20:25,678
I gave him a private session
later that night.

440
00:20:27,047 --> 00:20:29,548
And the rest, as they say, is sex.

441
00:20:31,383 --> 00:20:34,837
I'm really happy you two
found each other.

442
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,739
Okay, if nobody else
is gonna say it, then I will.

443
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:39,140
Please don't, haley.

444
00:20:39,223 --> 00:20:41,009
Taylor, at any point,
did it occur to you,

445
00:20:41,092 --> 00:20:43,044
"hooking up
with my sister's ex-husband...

446
00:20:43,127 --> 00:20:45,279
That might be kind of
insensitive...And whorish"?!

447
00:20:45,362 --> 00:20:46,813
Funny, no.

448
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:48,515
David, you and quinn
just got divorced.

449
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:50,050
How can you sleep
with someone else so soon?

450
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:51,417
Especially our sister!

451
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,686
Oh, you want to talk about
insensitive and horish?

452
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:57,089
Quinn had sex with this bozo
when we were still married

453
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,538
What?

454
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,161
Actually, uh...

455
00:21:04,244 --> 00:21:06,429
We've never had sex.

456
00:21:06,512 --> 00:21:08,680
I just told you that we did.

457
00:21:24,526 --> 00:21:26,646
Yes, nate,
I would love another beer.

458
00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:27,630
Good idea.

459
00:21:30,366 --> 00:21:32,234
Boy, can you clear a room.

460
00:21:40,108 --> 00:21:41,325
David.

461
00:21:41,408 --> 00:21:43,127
How could you lie to me
about something like that?

462
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,694
Becausyou weren't letting go!

463
00:21:44,777 --> 00:21:46,963
Okay, I needed you to move on,

464
00:21:47,046 --> 00:21:49,165
And I thought the only way
you'd do it is if you hated me.

465
00:21:49,248 --> 00:21:53,234
Well, mission accomplished.
I do hate you.

466
00:21:53,317 --> 00:21:54,869
David, listen to me.

467
00:21:54,952 --> 00:21:57,505
You know what? And say
what you want about taylor.

468
00:21:57,588 --> 00:21:59,489
At least she's been honest with me.

469
00:22:06,062 --> 00:22:07,915
I thought contract
negotiations were tense?

470
00:22:07,998 --> 00:22:09,597
It is insane in that room.

471
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:12,900
And david's bigger than I remember.

472
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:18,323
So you really haven't slept
with her?

473
00:22:18,406 --> 00:22:21,192
Shut up, man.
I like her.

474
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:22,427
I can tell.

475
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,862
You came here
instead of hiding out somewhere.

476
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:26,797
Yeah, I thought
I owed her that much,

477
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,832
Especially after the whole
kylie thing.

478
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:31,839
Hey, I don't suppose
that we could just

479
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:34,842
Hide in here for a while
and not go back?

480
00:22:34,925 --> 00:22:36,576
Probably not.

481
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,744
Anyway, you're the one that added

482
00:22:38,827 --> 00:22:41,280
"falling insanely in love
with quinn" to my contract.

483
00:22:41,363 --> 00:22:44,798
Probably should have added
sex to that, too, huh?

484
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:55,025
Why did you send alexander
to drop off julian's stuff?

485
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:56,392
He's really upset!

486
00:22:56,475 --> 00:23:00,129
What happened "no need
for unnecessary drama"?

487
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,130
Yeah, well, that drama
was very necessary, dear.

488
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:04,365
I needed to show you that
he still had feelings for you.

489
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,467
Whatever you do with that
information is up to you.

490
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,301
Mother!

491
00:23:07,384 --> 00:23:08,970
All right, enough said.

492
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:10,504
I'll keep out of it.

493
00:23:10,587 --> 00:23:13,507
Now, onto other business.

494
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,543
Millicent...
you're shutting her out.

495
00:23:15,626 --> 00:23:17,078
What do you care?

496
00:23:17,161 --> 00:23:19,246
Well, I've never been a fan
of millicent's,

497
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:21,015
But she was always there for you.

498
00:23:21,098 --> 00:23:23,850
She believed in you
when your own mother didn't.

499
00:23:23,933 --> 00:23:26,352
And now she needs someone
to believe in her.

500
00:23:26,435 --> 00:23:28,621
More important, she needs a friend.

501
00:23:28,704 --> 00:23:31,224
No, she doesn't.
She has you.

502
00:23:31,307 --> 00:23:33,875
I am not the friend type.

503
00:23:35,711 --> 00:23:38,465
Now I know whoy reminds me of.

504
00:23:38,548 --> 00:23:41,568
Who was that guy that you dated
freshman year?

505
00:23:41,651 --> 00:23:43,770
Dan thomson?

506
00:23:43,853 --> 00:23:46,206
Whatever happened to him?

507
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:49,375
You told him you'd sleep
with him if he broke up with

508
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:51,677
So he did...
And then yo did.

509
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,462
That's right. I'm the sister
who actually sleeps with guys.

510
00:23:56,365 --> 00:23:59,451
Do they give you a medal
for that or just a shot?

511
00:23:59,534 --> 00:24:01,887
We have cupcakes for desse,

512
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,289
In case anybody wants them.

513
00:24:04,372 --> 00:24:06,424
I bought them for jamie, but
taylor doesn't seem to have a problem

514
00:24:06,507 --> 00:24:08,326
Taking other people's stuff.

515
00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:09,727
I wish I could be like you, haley.

516
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,028
Just eat whatever I want
and get fat.

517
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:13,795
Your lip is about to get fat!

518
00:24:13,878 --> 00:24:15,229
All right, that's enough.
I can't take this anymore.

519
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:16,430
If anybody needs me,

520
00:24:16,513 --> 00:24:17,564
I'll be upstairs with the kids,

521
00:24:17,647 --> 00:24:19,214
Having a more mature conversation.

522
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:24,604
Your dad sucks!

523
00:24:24,687 --> 00:24:26,139
Excuse me?

524
00:24:26,222 --> 00:24:27,806
Chuck says your character
isn't that good.

525
00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:29,139
I said he sucks.

526
00:24:29,222 --> 00:24:31,470
And he hasn't even made
one basket yet.

527
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,021
Well, I'm sure my character is fine.

528
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:37,309
Why am I crying?

529
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,044
Because you got dunked on
three times,

530
00:24:39,127 --> 00:24:40,728
And then a fan threw a soda at you.

531
00:24:44,366 --> 00:24:46,651
I thought you were
supposed to be good.

532
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:48,218
I was.

533
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:49,519
I am.

534
00:24:49,602 --> 00:24:50,869
Give me this.

535
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:10,367
I heard you fired peter.

536
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,102
Yeah, I haven't had a great day.

537
00:25:14,185 --> 00:25:15,970
I also heard you knocked him out.

538
00:25:16,053 --> 00:25:17,738
His day was worse.

539
00:25:17,821 --> 00:25:22,375
You seem to be moving backwards
as a producer.

540
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:24,010
We start filming in a week.

541
00:25:24,093 --> 00:25:25,678
You have no costume designer.

542
00:25:25,761 --> 00:25:27,045
You knocked out my director.

543
00:25:27,128 --> 00:25:28,280
In fact, all you do have

544
00:25:28,363 --> 00:25:31,249
Is an unreliable,
uninsurable actress.

545
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:34,051
We've both invested a lot
of money in this movie.

546
00:25:34,134 --> 00:25:35,368
Find a way to fix it.

547
00:25:49,538 --> 00:25:51,172
Hey, why couldn't I do that?

548
00:25:51,273 --> 00:25:53,340
I guess only a scott
can play a scott.

549
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,228
Come on come on, come on!

550
00:25:57,311 --> 00:25:59,612
Boom! Game!

551
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,998
Eat that, chuck!
Who sucks now, huh?

552
00:26:02,081 --> 00:26:03,014
You do.

553
00:26:08,686 --> 00:26:12,272
When you're, um, done
with your "mature conversation,"

554
00:26:12,355 --> 00:26:13,555
Can I talk to you for a second?

555
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:20,677
Will you talk to david?

556
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,779
Will you help him realize
that what he's doing is wrong?

557
00:26:22,862 --> 00:26:24,883
Please, please.

558
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:26,787
Okay, yes.
I'll be right down.

559
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,971
Okay.
I'll be down in a sec.

560
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,793
All right, guys.
I got to head back down.

561
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:34,493
Everyone still fighting?

562
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:36,942
Afraid so.

563
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,682
Dude, your family's lame.

564
00:26:48,087 --> 00:26:50,387
Hey, you.

565
00:26:54,386 --> 00:26:57,506
I shouldn't have lied to david.

566
00:26:57,589 --> 00:27:00,608
Quinn, don't beat yourself up.

567
00:27:00,691 --> 00:27:03,644
Look, I think everyone
has done things in their past

568
00:27:03,727 --> 00:27:04,878
That they regret.

569
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:07,195
I know I have...

570
00:27:07,297 --> 00:27:09,299
He said about kylie.

571
00:27:11,235 --> 00:27:12,687
Yeah, it just makes it hard

572
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:14,722
When our pasts are swimming
in our pools

573
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:15,889
And cooking us dinner.

574
00:27:15,972 --> 00:27:18,407
I know.

575
00:27:24,813 --> 00:27:26,914
What's up?

576
00:27:28,717 --> 00:27:31,636
What?
What's so funny?

577
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:34,806
Just tell me you know
how messed up this is.

578
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:37,924
I was just trying to show quinn...

579
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,245
Yes, it's messed up.

580
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:47,866
Okay.
That's all I wanted to hear.

581
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:51,087
So you're not mad?

582
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,423
Well, I can't say I totally
support what you're doing,

583
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:55,291
But, um, I also didn't like

584
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:57,694
The way quinn handled things, so...

585
00:27:57,777 --> 00:27:59,896
Thanks.

586
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:02,931
But I got to say that
you are handling this

587
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,000
Way better than I would have.

588
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:08,336
It helps that you're here with me.

589
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:10,072
Thank you.

590
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,822
I'm happy to be here.

591
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,358
But I'm also happy to leave.

592
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,412
I'm just saying...

593
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:18,628
Yeah.

594
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:20,563
Anytime.

595
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:29,322
So, are you really into taylor,

596
00:28:29,405 --> 00:28:31,657
Or was this all
just to get back at quinn?

597
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,493
We're actually having fun together.

598
00:28:34,576 --> 00:28:37,462
She's the first person
that's made me smile in...

599
00:28:37,545 --> 00:28:39,464
Longer than I can remember.

600
00:28:39,547 --> 00:28:42,833
Well...That's good.

601
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:45,368
Just make sure you like her
for the right reasons

602
00:28:45,451 --> 00:28:47,719
And not because she reminds you
of her sister.

603
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:54,443
So we're cool?

604
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:55,811
Yeah.

605
00:28:55,894 --> 00:28:58,782
But if haley asks, I yelled
at you, and you're sorry.

606
00:28:58,865 --> 00:29:01,219
I am.

607
00:29:01,302 --> 00:29:03,771
Okay.

608
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,402
The place looks great.
Thank you.

609
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:16,571
Yeah, just don't ever

610
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,006
Look under the third cushion.

611
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,790
There are bad things under there!

612
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,311
How lame is it that
I actually had fun cleaning?

613
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:25,546
Can you tell how starved
for company I've been?

614
00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:27,215
I know how you feel.

615
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,184
I don't know anyone in l.A.
Besides skills,

616
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,786
And I barely see him
'cause he's so busy.

617
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:33,287
Yeah.

618
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,622
Being alone sucks.

619
00:29:35,705 --> 00:29:39,026
Skills misses you.
You know that, right?

620
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:41,998
I know.

621
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:44,300
It's just...

622
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:45,951
Being alone sucks.

623
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:49,187
Yeah.

624
00:29:58,231 --> 00:30:00,684
Sorry about this morning.

625
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:02,419
I'm sorry, too.

626
00:30:02,502 --> 00:30:06,089
I should have brought the box
to you myself.

627
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:09,693
But I just thought it would be
too hard to see you.

628
00:30:09,776 --> 00:30:12,211
That makes what I want
to ask difficult.

629
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:16,033
The movie shoots in a week,

630
00:30:16,116 --> 00:30:17,835
And we don't have a stume designer.

631
00:30:17,918 --> 00:30:19,570
And the reason we don't

632
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:23,273
Is because I was planning on
asking you when you got back...

633
00:30:23,356 --> 00:30:25,609
Which is why I'm asking you now.

634
00:30:25,692 --> 00:30:27,910
We just broke up.

635
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,944
I know.

636
00:30:30,027 --> 00:30:31,962
Good timing, huh?

637
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,587
But you're the only one I trust,

638
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,088
And I need the best for this movie.

639
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,257
I would love to help you,

640
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,826
But I don't know if I can do that.

641
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:45,794
Just think about it.
Okay?

642
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,529
You... you don't even
have to look at me

643
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,047
If you don't want to.

644
00:30:54,891 --> 00:30:57,911
Okay, I'll...Tnk about it.

645
00:30:57,994 --> 00:30:59,929
Thanks.

646
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,710
Haley.

647
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:19,627
I'm sorry.

648
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,062
We were wrong to come here.

649
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,697
Thank you.
That means a lot, david.

650
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,330
Don't apologize.
We haven't done anything wrong.

651
00:31:26,413 --> 00:31:27,996
You know, maybe david hasn't,

652
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,363
But you have been a problem
your whole life, taylor.

653
00:31:31,446 --> 00:31:33,297
When haley got her first period,

654
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,932
You tried to convince her
that she was dying!

655
00:31:36,015 --> 00:31:38,533
You told crazy uncle frank that I...

656
00:31:38,616 --> 00:31:40,268
That I had a crush on him?

657
00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:42,802
Oh, in high school,
you had sex in mom's car

658
00:31:42,885 --> 00:31:44,535
And then told her it was me.

659
00:31:44,618 --> 00:31:46,903
Well, to be fair,
it was with your ex-boyfriend.

660
00:31:46,986 --> 00:31:49,036
And now you're sleeping with david!

661
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,404
Why are you getting so mad at me

662
00:31:50,487 --> 00:31:51,704
About going after quinn's leftovers?

663
00:31:51,787 --> 00:31:52,638
You went after mine.

664
00:31:52,721 --> 00:31:54,138
I want you to admit

665
00:31:54,221 --> 00:31:55,839
That what you're doing is wrong!

666
00:31:55,922 --> 00:31:57,506
No! Say you're happy for me!

667
00:31:57,589 --> 00:32:00,209
Taylor, I'm so sick of

668
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:02,244
You're such a bitch
to everyone your whole life!

669
00:32:02,327 --> 00:32:04,513
Haley!
Taylor!

670
00:32:04,596 --> 00:32:05,462
Give us your blessing, haley!

671
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,625
Dude, I take it back.
Your family's cool!

672
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:31,624
I got five bucks on my mom.

673
00:32:31,707 --> 00:32:33,972
Oh, yeah!

674
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,537
You lucky, If nathan hadn't
stopped the fight,

675
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,805
I'd ve one less
christmas card to send.

676
00:32:48,888 --> 00:32:51,190
Oh, no. You mean I wouldn't get
another christmas card

677
00:32:51,326 --> 00:32:53,478
If Jamie dressed hasn't out
whatever would I do?

678
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:55,765
Enough already!
Just stop!

679
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:59,268
Just stop, please!

680
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:03,659
Did you get what you wanted?

681
00:33:03,742 --> 00:33:05,429
Are you satisfied now?

682
00:33:05,512 --> 00:33:07,314
Nightly.

683
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,774
Just promise me
you won't hurt david.

684
00:33:13,857 --> 00:33:15,543
Like you did?

685
00:33:15,885 --> 00:33:17,038
Yeah.

686
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,449
He's been through enough.

687
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,485
He doesn't need you
pretending to like him

688
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:24,186
Just to get back at me.

689
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:26,389
Who's pretending?
I do like him.

690
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,692
Fine.

691
00:33:28,775 --> 00:33:30,228
Fine.

692
00:33:30,311 --> 00:33:33,597
"Fine." "Fine." No.

693
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,066
No! It's not fine!It's not fin!

694
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:37,834
What is wrong with you two?!

695
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:40,169
I'm happy. Quinn's happy.
What do you want, haley?

696
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:42,419
I want you to admit
that you're a bitch!

697
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:46,523
That's fair.

698
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,861
Fine. I'm a bitch.

699
00:33:54,864 --> 00:33:56,831
Fine.

700
00:33:59,067 --> 00:34:00,218
What's going on?

701
00:34:00,301 --> 00:34:01,987
I t know, but they're not trying

702
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,723
To kill each other anymore, so...

703
00:34:03,806 --> 00:34:05,094
That's good, right?

704
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:07,333
If those three can work
through their differences,

705
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:08,802
Then maybe...

706
00:34:08,885 --> 00:34:11,655
Not a chance.

707
00:34:26,307 --> 00:34:27,541
Millie.

708
00:34:29,078 --> 00:34:31,547
You holding up okay?

709
00:34:33,248 --> 00:34:35,301
I'm getting there.

710
00:34:35,384 --> 00:34:37,202
Marvin came back last night.

711
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:39,303
That's great.

712
00:34:39,386 --> 00:34:41,273
It must be hard to see him

713
00:34:41,356 --> 00:34:43,909
After everything that's happened.

714
00:34:43,992 --> 00:34:47,031
It is.

715
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:51,105
But it was harder not seeing him.

716
00:34:52,777 --> 00:34:53,676
Millie?

717
00:34:58,147 --> 00:35:00,214
Can you help me with this?

718
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:03,450
Sure.

719
00:35:10,459 --> 00:35:12,094
Thanks.

720
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:28,559
You leaving?

721
00:35:28,642 --> 00:35:31,327
I never should have come.

722
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:34,563
I'm sorry I lied to you.

723
00:35:34,646 --> 00:35:37,147
I did it 'cause I wanted you
to be happy.

724
00:35:41,352 --> 00:35:43,737
Are you happy?

725
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,554
I'm getting there.

726
00:35:47,824 --> 00:35:49,576
You happy?

727
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:51,927
I am.

728
00:35:57,165 --> 00:35:58,064
David.

729
00:35:59,633 --> 00:36:01,000
This is yours.

730
00:36:04,937 --> 00:36:08,439
Just maybe don't give it to taylor.

731
00:36:17,081 --> 00:36:19,132
I'm sorry.

732
00:36:19,215 --> 00:36:20,448
It's okay.

733
00:36:22,084 --> 00:36:24,651
I'll be okay.

734
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:48,722
You didn't have to do all this.

735
00:36:48,805 --> 00:36:51,539
You shouldn't be living this way.

736
00:36:54,576 --> 00:36:56,995
So, are you leaving soon?

737
00:36:57,078 --> 00:37:00,131
No, I think I'm gonna st
for a while.

738
00:37:00,214 --> 00:37:02,566
Really?

739
00:37:02,649 --> 00:37:04,601
Why?

740
00:37:04,684 --> 00:37:08,086
Because you shouldn't be alone.

741
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:18,212
You really think I'm the best.

742
00:37:18,295 --> 00:37:20,047
Of course you are.

743
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,549
Soet me get this straight.

744
00:37:22,632 --> 00:37:26,186
I'm better than everybody else
on the planet

745
00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:28,756
Who could possibly do this job?

746
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:29,872
That's right.

747
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:37,363
Well, I guess if I am the best

748
00:37:37,446 --> 00:37:39,297
And you need the best...

749
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,098
Then I have to do it.

750
00:37:41,181 --> 00:37:43,716
It wouldn't be fair otherwise.

751
00:37:45,452 --> 00:37:46,603
When do I start?

752
00:37:46,686 --> 00:37:49,405
As soon as I find a dictor.

753
00:37:49,488 --> 00:37:51,774
You don't have a director?

754
00:37:51,857 --> 00:37:55,744
Did you hire anyone for this movie?

755
00:37:55,827 --> 00:37:58,195
The last guy didn't work out.

756
00:37:59,864 --> 00:38:01,816
What a shame.

757
00:38:01,899 --> 00:38:04,685
Too bad you don't know
anyone who's...

758
00:38:04,768 --> 00:38:06,786
Always wanted to direct...

759
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:10,189
Who knows the movie really well.

760
00:38:10,272 --> 00:38:14,908
I'm thinking someone whose name
rhymes with "shmulian"?

761
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,844
You know anyone like that?

762
00:38:20,514 --> 00:38:22,766
I don't think my dad
would go for that.

763
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:25,003
You know,
I've never directed before.

764
00:38:25,086 --> 00:38:26,537
Make him go for it.

765
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:30,173
Tell him you hired the best
costume designer on the planet,

766
00:38:30,256 --> 00:38:33,091
And she'll only work with you
if you direct.

767
00:38:34,426 --> 00:38:37,194
Because, p.S., that's now the deal.

768
00:38:38,397 --> 00:38:41,064
Have your people call my people.

769
00:38:55,678 --> 00:38:57,430
Another blast from your past?

770
00:38:57,513 --> 00:39:01,266
Ah, I had the locks changed today.

771
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:03,301
Thanks for sticking with me
through dinner.

772
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:05,437
I know it was
a pretty miserable time.

773
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,590
I kind of actually enjoyed it.

774
00:39:07,673 --> 00:39:09,006
Keys to your house, sir.

775
00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:10,907
Thank you very much.

776
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:15,911
Now you will be the only person
with a key to my house.

777
00:39:15,994 --> 00:39:17,846
You and the maid, that is.

778
00:39:17,929 --> 00:39:20,215
You didn't have to do this.

779
00:39:20,298 --> 00:39:21,950
Yeah, I know,
but I wanted to do something

780
00:39:22,033 --> 00:39:23,451
To show you how important
you are to me.

781
00:39:23,534 --> 00:39:24,952
I know I've said it,

782
00:39:25,035 --> 00:39:27,655
But this way, you have proof
in case you ever forget.

783
00:39:27,738 --> 00:39:29,757
I was just lucky I was able
to find a locksmith

784
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,559
On such short notice.

785
00:39:31,642 --> 00:39:34,143
You're about to get even luckier.

786
00:39:37,014 --> 00:39:38,332
Finally.

787
00:39:38,415 --> 00:39:40,191
Can we tell everyone
at the next dinner?

788
00:39:41,485 --> 00:39:44,420
Come on.

789
00:39:47,557 --> 00:39:49,790
Thank you, jessica.

790
00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:53,942
I made a list of directors

791
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:56,709
Who won't mind working
with a suicidal actress

792
00:39:56,792 --> 00:39:59,779
And a psychotic producer
for minimal pay.

793
00:39:59,862 --> 00:40:01,862
I want to direct.

794
00:40:03,231 --> 00:40:05,383
I know this movi
I know how to deal with alex,

795
00:40:05,466 --> 00:40:07,033
And I got you to keep me on track.

796
00:40:08,568 --> 00:40:09,835
What do you think?

797
00:40:14,473 --> 00:40:16,558
You were at the top of t list.

798
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:18,827
We have less than a week
before we ro.

799
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,829
Better get to work.

800
00:40:20,912 --> 00:40:23,713
Yes, sir.

801
00:40:29,752 --> 00:40:32,872
I cannot wait to get into bed

802
00:40:32,955 --> 00:40:36,742
And forget about
this awful, awful day.

803
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:39,378
Why?
It was a good day.

804
00:40:39,461 --> 00:40:41,847
What was good about it?

805
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,148
Well, of all the crazy drama today,

806
00:40:44,231 --> 00:40:45,616
None of it was ours.

807
00:40:45,699 --> 00:40:48,919
There were no psycho women
stalking me or my family.

808
00:40:49,002 --> 00:40:51,888
There were no contract problems.
There was no dan.

809
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:54,456
I'd take a million days like today.

810
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:57,325
Yeah, I guess you're right.

811
00:40:57,408 --> 00:40:59,109
It was a good day.

812
00:41:17,258 --> 00:41:19,143
Your...

813
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,578
Your family's crazy.

814
00:41:21,661 --> 00:41:23,179
Whatever.

815
00:41:23,262 --> 00:41:25,014
What time does "scott free" come on?

816
00:41:25,097 --> 00:41:26,463
Oh, nice!
