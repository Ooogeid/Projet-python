1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,234
<i>Previously on "one tree hill"...</i>

2
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:02,851
I stripped naked,

3
00:00:02,934 --> 00:00:04,218
And that boy didn't even flinch.

4
00:00:04,301 --> 00:00:05,684
<i>I'm sorry.
What did i do ?</i>

5
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:08,617
What you didn't do is tell me
that ho bag got naked for you.

6
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,817
Oh, that.

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,084
You... couch.

8
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:12,585
You... fired.

9
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:14,051
Did you go home with that guy
last night ?

10
00:00:14,134 --> 00:00:15,551
Yeah.

11
00:00:15,634 --> 00:00:17,084
Nathan doesn't want us hanging out,

12
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:18,284
And i, uh, i have to respect that.

13
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:19,684
How'd you like
to stay the night tonight ?

14
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:21,084
Like old times.

15
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:22,518
That's up to you, isn't it ?

16
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:23,951
I'd been given only days to live.

17
00:00:24,034 --> 00:00:26,318
That was 14 months ago.

18
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,318
I have a proposition for you.

19
00:00:28,401 --> 00:00:30,485
Nathan's your son.
It could ruin him.

20
00:00:30,568 --> 00:00:32,884
He's doing this
because he wants to bury nathan.

21
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:34,451
And the deeper nathan is buried,

22
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,917
The more money he'll have to
pay you to dig himself out.

23
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,084
Okay.

24
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:40,067
I'm in.

25
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:58,518
They're excited.

26
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:01,485
And i didn't even have to
pay them this time.

27
00:01:01,568 --> 00:01:04,201
It's gonna be a big show.

28
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:10,051
Dan, you reached out to nathan,
and he hung up on you.

29
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:12,418
He was never gonna
forgive you, anyway.

30
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:16,700
Sometimes the truth is all we have.

31
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,318
Skills is gonna take jamie
for the day,

32
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:44,351
Just to keep him away from the tv.

33
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:45,934
Yeah.

34
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:51,218
You know, the first memory i have

35
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:53,951
Is sitting on my father's lap
holding a basketball.

36
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:57,100
He spent my entire life
trying to get me into the nba.

37
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:01,467
Now he's gonna take it away.

38
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,067
What are you looking at, goof ?

39
00:02:57,467 --> 00:02:58,784
How you doing ?

40
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:01,318
Uh, you didn't tell me
that this show was live.

41
00:03:01,401 --> 00:03:03,151
Oh, it's better this way.

42
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:05,451
Bigger audience, bigger ratings.

43
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:08,351
After today,
everyone will know your story.

44
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:10,485
I'm nervous.

45
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:12,017
Don't be.

46
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,884
Just speak from your heart,
and don't forget to smile.

47
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:16,118
You'll be fine.

48
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:17,884
Mr. Scott ?

49
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:19,051
Yeah ?

50
00:03:19,134 --> 00:03:21,218
What happened
between you and nathan ?

51
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,717
I murdered his uncle...

52
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,017
Among other things.

53
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,301
I'll see you out there.

54
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:32,917
This should be the last of it.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,884
I'm so sorry about all this.

56
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:36,684
It's fine.
No, it's not fine.

57
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:38,384
You've been amazing
about everything,

58
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:39,551
And it just...

59
00:03:39,634 --> 00:03:41,650
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:43,318
I'll talk to him.

61
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:44,951
These aren't mine.

62
00:03:45,034 --> 00:03:47,251
Awesome.

63
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:48,784
Awesome.

64
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:50,717
Are you coming to watch the show ?

65
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,318
No, i need to watch it here.

66
00:03:52,401 --> 00:03:53,884
I told nate i'd call him after.

67
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,017
Okay.

68
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,418
See ya.

69
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:58,451
Drive safe.

70
00:03:58,534 --> 00:03:59,434
Thanks.

71
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:02,267
Hey, clay ?

72
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:05,851
I hope everything turns out okay.

73
00:04:05,934 --> 00:04:07,951
You and nathan
are both really great guys,

74
00:04:08,034 --> 00:04:09,784
And you deserve better.

75
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:11,784
So do you, quinn.

76
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:12,784
I'll see you later.

77
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:13,800
Bye.

78
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:27,684
So, let's run down the list.

79
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,218
There's blondie from
the body-wash commercial.

80
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:33,617
She has a name, you know.
It's kylie.

81
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,451
Of course it is.

82
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:37,917
There's the actress who can...

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,784
be in your bed in 20 minutes.

84
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:41,984
Make it 30.

85
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:43,617
And there's this one,

86
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,434
Nathan's sister-in-law.

87
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:50,601
It's a little early for a beer,
isn't it ?

88
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:54,318
You know what i want ?

89
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:55,750
Grape kool-aid.

90
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,518
Stop it.

91
00:04:57,601 --> 00:04:59,684
It's okay if you like her.

92
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,518
No, it's not.
Why not ?

93
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,951
Because she's somebody's wife.

94
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:04,967
<i>So ? I was your wife.</i>

95
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:08,151
Yeah.

96
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:10,000
But you left me.

97
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:12,934
Things change, clay.

98
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:17,051
She's beautiful...

99
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:18,401
And you like her.

100
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,100
She's not you.

101
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:29,084
Look, i have to watch
nathan's and my career

102
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:31,750
Possibly end
on this nightmare tv show.

103
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,318
You can go if you want.

104
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:36,084
No, don't be silly, babe.

105
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:37,900
I'm not going anywhere.

106
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:46,051
Oh, hey, hey, hey, here.

107
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:47,284
Thanks.

108
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:48,650
<i>Oh, what is all this ?</i>

109
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:50,218
David dropped off some of my stuff.

110
00:05:50,301 --> 00:05:51,951
In the garage ?

111
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:52,934
Not exactly.

112
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:56,917
Look, hales, i thought
i'd just watch from my room,

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,251
You know, to give you and nathan
some space.

114
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:00,917
But i'm here if you need me.

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,551
I know, quinny.
Thank you.

116
00:06:02,634 --> 00:06:03,833
Okay.

117
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:15,284
Nathan...

118
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:18,501
Hey, um, it's gonna start soon.

119
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,851
It's been a good life, huh ?

120
00:06:25,934 --> 00:06:27,485
Yeah.

121
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:30,717
It's been a wonderful life.

122
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,617
You know, when this show is over,

123
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,418
It's still gonna be a wonderful life

124
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:37,384
Because i love you
and your son loves you,

125
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:39,518
And nothing that happens
in the next hour

126
00:06:39,601 --> 00:06:41,084
Is gonna change that.

127
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:44,617
God, i needed to hear you say that.

128
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,700
Good.

129
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:50,833
I really needed to say it.

130
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,284
My guest tonight's
grown rather infamous

131
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:59,418
Over the last few weeks.

132
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:01,700
Her name is renee richardson,

133
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,418
And she's nearly 4 months pregnant.

134
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:07,051
And she claims that this nba player

135
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:09,501
Is the father of her unborn child.

136
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:14,134
That player happens to be my son.

137
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:20,051
They say that truth is the best
vindication against slander.

138
00:07:20,134 --> 00:07:22,817
<i>So what is the truth ?</i>

139
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,384
<i>Is she lying,</i>

140
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:28,084
<i>or am i about to become
a grandfather again ?</i>

141
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:31,067
<i>We'll meet her and hear her
story when we come back.</i>

142
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:44,034
<i>Believe nothing</i>

143
00:07:44,117 --> 00:07:45,600
<i>just because a wise man said it</i>

144
00:07:45,683 --> 00:07:46,834
<i>or you read it in a book</i>

145
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:48,401
Or it's of divine origin

146
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:50,501
Or simply because
your mother told you.

147
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:52,268
It doesn't make it true.

148
00:07:52,726 --> 00:07:57,351
Believe only what you yourself
can test and judge to be true.

149
00:07:58,017 --> 00:07:59,401
Ladies and gentlemen,

150
00:07:59,484 --> 00:08:02,251
Please welcome my guest,
renee richardson.

151
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:07,686
Here we go.

152
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,401
<i>Hi, renee. Hi.
Thank you for having me.</i>

153
00:08:10,484 --> 00:08:11,451
She's pretty.

154
00:08:13,217 --> 00:08:16,934
Crazy-looking as all hell,
but... pretty.

155
00:08:17,017 --> 00:08:18,600
We're gonna talk
about a lot of things tonight,

156
00:08:18,683 --> 00:08:20,201
But just to set the stage,

157
00:08:20,284 --> 00:08:22,168
Can you tell us a little bit
about the night

158
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,535
Of the alleged affair,
the first time you met nathan ?

159
00:08:24,618 --> 00:08:27,501
Um, we had been to a lot
of the same parties and clubs,

160
00:08:27,584 --> 00:08:29,634
But we hadn't really
been introduced.

161
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,901
And that was, what,
nearly four months ago ?

162
00:08:31,984 --> 00:08:33,501
Um, that's right.

163
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:36,234
Uh, i remember because it was
the night of the memphis game,

164
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:39,134
And nathan scored
his season high that night.

165
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:43,334
35 points, 11 assists,
and six boards ?

166
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:45,268
<i>You killed it tonight !</i>

167
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:47,334
Here is to your contract year

168
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:50,068
And to making my job
a hell of a lot easier.

169
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:51,700
Cheers.

170
00:08:51,783 --> 00:08:53,934
Excuse me ?
I'm sorry.

171
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:56,901
I don't mean to bother you,
but could we get a picture ?

172
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:59,334
Absolutely.
Just give us one second.

173
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:02,867
<i>Dude, having you around
is so much better than a puppy.</i>

174
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,634
But seriously...

175
00:09:04,717 --> 00:09:05,967
I'm proud of you,

176
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,950
And i love you,
and you absolutely deserve this.

177
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,700
Oh, yeah, that's the one.

178
00:09:14,783 --> 00:09:16,535
All right, let's do this.

179
00:09:16,618 --> 00:09:20,068
Nathan scott, the girls.
The girls, nathan scott.

180
00:09:20,151 --> 00:09:21,634
Hi. Nathan.
Nice to meet you.

181
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:22,667
How you doing ?
Nathan.

182
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,535
All right.

183
00:09:24,618 --> 00:09:26,168
All right.

184
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:27,967
Mmm.
Somebody smells good.

185
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,734
That's the rainstorm body spray.

186
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:32,468
All right, let's make it look sexy.

187
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:36,535
And on the count of 2.
1... 2.

188
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,101
We were really hammered that night.

189
00:09:39,184 --> 00:09:41,967
It was the longest road trip
of the year.

190
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,584
You were lonely.

191
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,317
I'm always lonely.

192
00:09:48,683 --> 00:09:50,384
On the count of 2.

193
00:09:57,783 --> 00:09:59,984
Whoo !

194
00:10:03,017 --> 00:10:05,068
That's a long way down.

195
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:06,867
Thanks.

196
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,901
That really helps me right now.

197
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:12,234
Sorry, i'm... i'm just not
a huge fan of heights.

198
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:13,435
Yeah...

199
00:10:13,518 --> 00:10:15,001
You know, beer bongs i can do.

200
00:10:15,084 --> 00:10:17,501
I think they are
a beautiful college tradition.

201
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,867
Streaking through the quad...
that's another one.

202
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:20,967
Well, i could do that.

203
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,368
Yeah ?

204
00:10:22,451 --> 00:10:24,518
Man, did i pick the wrong school.

205
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,667
I'm clay.

206
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,801
Hi. I'm sara.

207
00:10:30,884 --> 00:10:33,750
How about we do this together ?

208
00:10:37,783 --> 00:10:39,401
On the count of 2.

209
00:10:39,484 --> 00:10:40,901
Wait !

210
00:10:40,984 --> 00:10:43,901
On the count of 2 ?
Nobody goes on the count of 2.

211
00:10:43,984 --> 00:10:45,468
Yeah, i know.
I'll be our thing...

212
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:47,284
Something we can tell
the grandkids about.

213
00:10:49,184 --> 00:10:51,368
Well, i'm gonna tell them
about streaking on the quad.

214
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,618
Yeah, nobody wants to hear that
from their grandparents.

215
00:10:54,984 --> 00:10:56,700
Actually, i take that back.

216
00:10:56,783 --> 00:10:57,917
<i>Everyone would love hearing
that from their grandparents.</i>

217
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,134
Attagirl. You ready ?

218
00:11:01,217 --> 00:11:02,435
You okay ?

219
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:03,435
On 2.

220
00:11:03,518 --> 00:11:06,301
1...

221
00:11:06,384 --> 00:11:08,151
2.

222
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:16,867
See ?

223
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,650
How badass were you ?

224
00:11:22,618 --> 00:11:25,551
<i>Tell that to the grandkids.</i>

225
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,700
Let's back up a little bit
to when you were younger.

226
00:11:29,783 --> 00:11:32,700
We did our research
and found out you were once...

227
00:11:32,783 --> 00:11:34,068
A cheerleader...

228
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,600
Uh, yes.

229
00:11:35,683 --> 00:11:37,934
... and a homecoming queen...

230
00:11:38,017 --> 00:11:41,201
And, more recently,
a hostess in a club.

231
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,034
Uh, yes, but there was no nudity
or anything.

232
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:46,134
I understand.
My wife was a stripper...

233
00:11:46,217 --> 00:11:47,618
<i>a little nudity.</i>

234
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,068
Have you ever been married ?

235
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:52,867
No.

236
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,767
But you knew nathan was married.

237
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,134
I-i felt bad about it.

238
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:58,801
I mean, obviously,
i-i wish that he wasn't,

239
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,801
But... i was attracted to him.

240
00:12:01,884 --> 00:12:04,600
And attraction is not a choice.

241
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,050
It just is.

242
00:12:08,151 --> 00:12:09,600
Have you ever been in love, renee ?

243
00:12:09,683 --> 00:12:11,867
Yes.

244
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,384
It feels good, doesn't it ?

245
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:18,535
Falling in love is the easiest
thing you're ever gonna do.

246
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:21,368
It's the most exciting thing.

247
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:24,184
It's the most powerful thing.

248
00:12:27,884 --> 00:12:31,068
<i>That's why falling out of love
hurts like hell.</i>

249
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:34,368
<i>But falling in love...
there's nothing better.</i>

250
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:36,351
<i>It's the best it ever gets.</i>

251
00:12:42,783 --> 00:12:44,034
Mm.

252
00:12:44,117 --> 00:12:46,717
Did i ever tell you
how amazing you are ?

253
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,700
You're amazing...
and beautiful...

254
00:12:50,783 --> 00:12:52,501
And talented.

255
00:12:52,584 --> 00:12:54,134
And one of these days,

256
00:12:54,217 --> 00:12:56,368
<i>i'm gonna get you a real darkroom,</i>

257
00:12:56,451 --> 00:12:58,950
Not just some cramped
apartment bathroom.

258
00:13:00,717 --> 00:13:03,767
Stop. Come here.
Look at this.

259
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,801
Look how happy you are.

260
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:10,834
<i>I don't need a big darkroom.</i>

261
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:13,201
I just need you
to always be that happy,

262
00:13:13,284 --> 00:13:14,650
'cause you deserve that.

263
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,584
How'd i get so lucky with you ?

264
00:13:24,184 --> 00:13:27,934
Technically, you haven't
gotten lucky just yet.

265
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:30,417
But i think you're about to.

266
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:39,184
<i>We got to get a bigger darkroom.</i>

267
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:42,600
And then you kissed.

268
00:13:42,683 --> 00:13:44,401
Yes.

269
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:46,268
And the kissing escalated.

270
00:13:46,351 --> 00:13:48,518
Yes.

271
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,867
When we come back,

272
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,567
We're gonna talk a little
about love and loss

273
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,667
And how we're sometimes
our own worst enemies.

274
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,567
And then we're gonna find out
if renee is telling the truth,

275
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,717
After this.

276
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:20,784
You awake ?

277
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:23,900
Depends.
Good news or bad news ?

278
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:29,851
That video position came up
at work again.

279
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:31,318
And i took it.

280
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:33,584
David, why ?

281
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:36,418
Because i'm tired of being poor.

282
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,418
We're not poor.
We're frugal.

283
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:40,584
Mrs. Padilla said she's been
driving you to work.

284
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:42,650
It's just sometimes the car
won't start.

285
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:43,984
How do you get home ?

286
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:46,218
I catch a ride or i walk.

287
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:47,451
Quinn.

288
00:14:47,534 --> 00:14:49,617
<i>I like walking.</i>

289
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,650
Baby, what about your documentary ?

290
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:56,151
I stopped at the library
and got the grant forms.

291
00:14:56,234 --> 00:14:58,517
It's what we've talked about.

292
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,951
It's what you've always wanted.

293
00:15:00,034 --> 00:15:02,550
And i'll still want it
a year from now.

294
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:04,650
But this is good money, quinn.

295
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:06,684
I want to get you a house...

296
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:08,451
And that darkroom.

297
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:11,684
I don't need those things.

298
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:16,351
I need you to be happy and inspired.

299
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:18,318
<i>Well, this will make me happy.</i>

300
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:20,667
<i>And you'll keep me inspired.</i>

301
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,517
Please ?

302
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,817
Say it's okay ?

303
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,650
Say, "okay." Okay,
okay, okay, okay, okay.

304
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:33,051
Promise me
you'll fill out the forms.

305
00:15:33,134 --> 00:15:35,084
Of course. And if something comes up,
then, that you'll take it.

306
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,650
Of course, of course,
of course, of course.

307
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:37,684
I promise.

308
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:39,134
Okay.

309
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:44,118
I love you, you know that ?

310
00:15:44,201 --> 00:15:46,584
I love you, too.

311
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:49,418
Falling in love is easy.

312
00:15:49,501 --> 00:15:53,684
But a lifetime of love...
now, there's a miracle.

313
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:55,717
You know i love you.

314
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,184
And you know i fired alex,

315
00:15:57,267 --> 00:15:59,018
But you're still working with her.

316
00:15:59,101 --> 00:16:02,351
I like her script, brooke.

317
00:16:02,434 --> 00:16:04,434
<i>You like her script
or you like her ?</i>

318
00:16:06,468 --> 00:16:08,485
Relationships aren't always easy.

319
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:12,351
I should know.
I'm on my second marriage.

320
00:16:12,434 --> 00:16:14,351
Yep.

321
00:16:14,434 --> 00:16:16,534
How many of you are divorced ?

322
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:21,385
<i>Divorce doesn't just happen.</i>

323
00:16:21,468 --> 00:16:24,351
<i>And relationships
don't just end in an instant.</i>

324
00:16:24,434 --> 00:16:27,367
What'd you do with your ring,
anyway ?

325
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:31,418
Your wedding band.

326
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:32,967
Where is it ?

327
00:16:34,468 --> 00:16:36,751
I don't know.

328
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:39,633
You don't know,
or you don't want to remember ?

329
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,517
Hey, sara...

330
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,900
What do you think ?

331
00:16:46,934 --> 00:16:48,884
I think you look like a boy
playing dress-up.

332
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,617
Come on.
This is my shot.

333
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,318
I got to get in the mailroom,
i become an assistant,

334
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:56,051
They make me junior agent,

335
00:16:56,134 --> 00:16:57,717
And i'm in.
And you're in.

336
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,784
Help.

337
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:02,151
The person interviewing you...
it's a woman, right ?

338
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:03,584
Yeah.

339
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:07,318
Jeans and a button-up shirt,

340
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,318
<i>and go heavy on the boyish grin.</i>

341
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:11,717
You sure ?

342
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,334
Hey, it got you me, didn't it ?

343
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,434
You don't think
that will be too casual ?

344
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:30,900
Here.

345
00:17:33,267 --> 00:17:38,118
Married says mature,
stable, and dependable...

346
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:40,617
Everything they'll want to see
in a future agent.

347
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,700
Only i'm not married.

348
00:17:44,534 --> 00:17:47,367
Then marry me, you knucklehead.

349
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:50,867
Yes.

350
00:17:52,301 --> 00:17:53,451
Yes !

351
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:55,301
Well, there's that boyish grin !

352
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,851
We all want to be loved,
to be happy.

353
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:04,218
So why aren't we ?

354
00:18:04,301 --> 00:18:05,851
Because we've become experts

355
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:07,733
At sabotaging our own happiness...

356
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:12,617
... feeling like victims,
when, in fact,

357
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,151
It's the choices we make.

358
00:18:14,234 --> 00:18:15,951
The bad habits, the vices,

359
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:18,784
The inability to show love
and compassion...

360
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:21,351
These are the things
that tear us down.

361
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,118
We're not...

362
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:26,018
Victims.

363
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:29,334
We're assassins when it comes
to love and happiness.

364
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:32,917
Renee is beautiful,

365
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,418
And she's smart,
and she wants love in her life,

366
00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:39,485
And yet who did she choose
to sleep with ?

367
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:41,984
Allegedly.

368
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,501
A man who was unavailable to her.

369
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:50,084
Now, she may be telling the truth...

370
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:52,184
And she may deserve compensation,

371
00:18:52,267 --> 00:18:53,600
But she is no victim.

372
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:59,584
Oh.

373
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:02,650
We applaud the sentiment,
but we don't change.

374
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:04,617
Why ?

375
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,284
Because we want what we want.

376
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,018
So we do it, we say it, try it,

377
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:10,184
And we victimize ourselves,
and we hire an attorney,

378
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:11,834
And it has to stop.

379
00:19:15,468 --> 00:19:17,617
Renee...

380
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,451
You say nathan scott,

381
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,817
My son, is the father
of your unborn child, right ?

382
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,917
Yes.

383
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,267
I believe you.

384
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:34,517
<i>I think you're telling the truth.</i>

385
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,018
And more than that,
i'm going to prove it...

386
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:42,900
With the help of
this lie-detector machine...

387
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,534
... when we come back.

388
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,418
This is just...

389
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:00,401
This is unbelievable.

390
00:20:14,301 --> 00:20:15,617
Two minutes, guys.

391
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,451
What is this about ?

392
00:20:17,534 --> 00:20:19,284
What's what about, honey ?

393
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:21,051
No, i-i didn't agree to this.

394
00:20:21,134 --> 00:20:22,751
Relax.
It's great television.

395
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:24,184
No, you don't... here's the thing...

396
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:27,485
If you're lying, science
will prove it eventually,

397
00:20:27,568 --> 00:20:30,418
And if not, you have nothing
to worry about.

398
00:20:30,501 --> 00:20:32,034
Don't forget to smile.

399
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,151
Nathan.

400
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:39,418
Do you believe this ?

401
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:41,550
Do you realize how ridiculous
this is ?

402
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:44,184
The guy shot his brother
at point-blank range,

403
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:45,884
And now he has a hit tv show.

404
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:48,418
He's rolling out some rigged-up
lie-detector machine,

405
00:20:48,501 --> 00:20:51,184
And i have to sit 3,000 miles
away and just take it.

406
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:52,684
Screw him.

407
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:54,118
I mean it.

408
00:20:54,201 --> 00:20:57,118
Let's not even watch
the rest of the show.

409
00:20:57,201 --> 00:20:59,451
It's a nice day.

410
00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:00,967
It's a nice life.

411
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:06,418
How can you be so strong ?

412
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:09,018
It's a question of character.

413
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,451
It's really about
who has better character.

414
00:21:12,534 --> 00:21:14,684
Is it renee...

415
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:16,550
<i>or nathan ?</i>

416
00:21:16,633 --> 00:21:18,784
And if you sign with me,

417
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:21,485
I promise you
that the energy and resources

418
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:23,451
That i'll dedicate to you
and your career

419
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:25,584
Will be unmatched.

420
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:28,267
Okay. I'm in !

421
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:32,984
Can i give you my two cents ? Sure.

422
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:35,550
This is all still about
that wide receiver, right ?

423
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:36,834
Yeah.

424
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:41,101
I think...

425
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:46,351
... you can do better.

426
00:21:46,434 --> 00:21:47,851
Babe, this guy is a big deal.

427
00:21:47,934 --> 00:21:49,684
I mean, he can change
everything for me.

428
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,151
But you said it yourself...
he's a bad guy.

429
00:21:52,234 --> 00:21:53,650
And if i only represent good guys,

430
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:55,051
I may have no clients at all.

431
00:21:55,134 --> 00:21:57,717
No, i don't believe that.
I don't think you do, either.

432
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,517
The guy is great, sara.

433
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,184
<i>He's not great.
He's just a great player.</i>

434
00:22:03,267 --> 00:22:05,851
And the man i love
knows the difference.

435
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:09,951
That's what's gonna make you
a great agent.

436
00:22:10,034 --> 00:22:12,717
You'll find players
that you can believe in

437
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,717
And clients that become friends.

438
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,018
You'll find someone

439
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:20,784
Who has integrity
and character and heart.

440
00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:23,568
<i>And that will change everything
for you.</i>

441
00:22:26,101 --> 00:22:30,101
<i>And that's the man
i fell in love with.</i>

442
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,584
I love you, you know that.

443
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:34,867
I know.

444
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:39,018
You really hurt my feelings

445
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:40,550
When you said
we weren't getting married.

446
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:42,951
When did i ever say anything
about marriage ?

447
00:22:43,034 --> 00:22:44,650
When your dad came to town.

448
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:46,851
You said we weren't getting married

449
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:49,951
Like it was some sort of
completely ridiculous notion

450
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:51,051
To you.

451
00:22:51,134 --> 00:22:52,151
No.

452
00:22:52,234 --> 00:22:53,184
Brooke, i was venting.

453
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:54,451
It had nothing to do

454
00:22:54,534 --> 00:22:56,167
With the actual concept
of marrying you.

455
00:22:58,134 --> 00:23:00,284
I think about that all the time.

456
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:02,617
Really ?

457
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,568
Yeah.

458
00:23:06,067 --> 00:23:09,167
Well, good, because that's what
i wrote in the sand.

459
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,151
That night you said you were gonna
take that movie in new zealand,

460
00:23:13,234 --> 00:23:15,650
I-i wrote "marry me" in the sand,

461
00:23:15,733 --> 00:23:17,118
And then i didn't tell you

462
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:18,800
Because you said you were leaving.

463
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,617
Surprise.

464
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,401
David ?

465
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:29,434
David.

466
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:35,851
What is this ?

467
00:23:35,934 --> 00:23:38,084
Surprise.

468
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,485
I know this is a surprise,

469
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:41,118
But we have an expression
on this show...

470
00:23:41,201 --> 00:23:42,451
Step into the light...

471
00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:44,451
and get yourself right !

472
00:23:44,534 --> 00:23:45,984
... and get yourself right.

473
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:47,184
During the break,

474
00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:48,684
We hooked renee up
to a lie detector,

475
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:50,184
And here's how it works.

476
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:53,084
I'll ask renee a question,
and depending on her answer,

477
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:55,084
The words "true" or "lie"

478
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,451
Will appear on the screens
behind me.

479
00:23:57,534 --> 00:24:00,084
For instance,
is your name renee richardson ?

480
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:01,101
Yes.

481
00:24:03,434 --> 00:24:04,917
Excellent.
Let's begin.

482
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,884
Did you, in fact,
meet nathan scott at a party,

483
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:09,517
As you described earlier ?

484
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,834
Yes.

485
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:15,018
<i>Did you flirt with nathan scott ?</i>

486
00:24:15,101 --> 00:24:16,733
Yes.

487
00:24:18,434 --> 00:24:20,351
Did nathan flirt back ?

488
00:24:20,434 --> 00:24:22,118
You smell good.

489
00:24:22,201 --> 00:24:24,151
That's my rainstorm body spray.

490
00:24:25,468 --> 00:24:26,800
Yes.

491
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:33,084
Believe only what you yourself
test and judge to be true.

492
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:36,851
Renee, is nathan scott, my son,

493
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,834
The father of your unborn child ?

494
00:24:46,934 --> 00:24:49,000
Yes.

495
00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:06,152
Hey, it's Clay.

496
00:25:06,235 --> 00:25:08,218
It's my third time calling, buddy.

497
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:09,984
Look, i'm watching the show
right now,

498
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:12,784
And i, um... i just want
to talk to you.

499
00:25:12,867 --> 00:25:14,800
So, please call me back, all right ?

500
00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:20,051
Hales ?

501
00:25:20,134 --> 00:25:21,467
Nathan ?

502
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,784
Hey, david, do you know where...

503
00:25:37,867 --> 00:25:39,117
Hey, babe.

504
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,551
Uh... what is this ?

505
00:25:42,634 --> 00:25:46,717
Okay, okay, i-i know it's expensive,

506
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,784
But i just had a thought...

507
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:50,218
Screening room.

508
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:52,418
Okay.
I'm just saying...

509
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:55,951
I go to work, i come home,
i sit here...

510
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:58,067
I'm happy.

511
00:26:02,401 --> 00:26:05,117
Remember that old car that we had...

512
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,367
And the futon ?

513
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,518
We were really happy then.

514
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:12,067
Yeah, that futon sucked, baby.

515
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:18,267
I love this picture of you.

516
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:20,850
Really ?

517
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:24,218
'cause that guy was struggling,
foolish, and broke.

518
00:26:24,301 --> 00:26:25,933
That's not true.
Quinn...

519
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:30,551
... you've got some crazy,
romantic notion

520
00:26:30,634 --> 00:26:33,084
<i>of who i used to be,
of who we used to be.</i>

521
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:35,518
We were just naive kids.

522
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:37,951
God forbid i ever go back to that.

523
00:26:38,034 --> 00:26:39,717
Can you hand me
a phillips screwdriver ?

524
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,451
It's in the box over there.

525
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:43,351
Sure.

526
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:45,951
How great is this room, by the way ?

527
00:26:46,034 --> 00:26:47,900
No windows.
It's perfect.

528
00:26:51,034 --> 00:26:52,768
It's a really dark room.

529
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:57,800
Did you mean it when you proposed ?

530
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,917
I did that night.

531
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,784
But not anymore.

532
00:27:02,867 --> 00:27:05,100
I don't know right now.

533
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:11,318
I'm sorry.

534
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:12,800
I didn't know.

535
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:20,634
I'm sorry i hurt your feelings.

536
00:27:26,367 --> 00:27:29,351
Sometimes we fall short of
the people we are meant to be,

537
00:27:29,434 --> 00:27:32,301
And sometimes people do things
they're ashamed of.

538
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,951
Thank you, renee.

539
00:27:35,034 --> 00:27:37,484
And usually,
after the guilt sets in,

540
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:39,200
We make things worse.

541
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:43,651
My son, nathan scott, is a good man,

542
00:27:43,734 --> 00:27:46,084
But sometimes people do funny things

543
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,518
In the face of pressure
and desperation.

544
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:50,184
And the truth...

545
00:27:50,267 --> 00:27:54,618
Well, truth is an absolute,

546
00:27:54,701 --> 00:27:56,601
And the truth can set you free.

547
00:27:58,867 --> 00:28:00,501
My name is dan scott.

548
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:05,701
I love my wife, rachel.

549
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,518
What is he doing ?

550
00:28:10,601 --> 00:28:12,334
My son, nathan, loves me.

551
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:18,567
I'm president of the united states.

552
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:24,367
I'm santa claus.

553
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:29,134
I didn't kill my brother.

554
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,734
Hey, you guys got to get in here !

555
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:38,434
Life is funny, isn't it ?

556
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:43,117
Sometimes bad things
happen to good people,

557
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,551
And it isn't fair.

558
00:28:45,634 --> 00:28:47,585
This is a still frame
of the moment i told you

559
00:28:47,668 --> 00:28:49,518
We were gonna do
the lie-detector test.

560
00:28:49,601 --> 00:28:52,884
Your pupils are dilated.
Your eyebrows are arched.

561
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:54,301
It means you were surprised.

562
00:28:57,067 --> 00:28:59,151
This is a still frame of the moment

563
00:28:59,234 --> 00:29:01,518
After you said nathan
had slept with you

564
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:03,984
And the monitors said "true."

565
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:05,734
You were surprised again,
weren't you ?

566
00:29:10,634 --> 00:29:13,200
Sometimes bad things happen
to good people.

567
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,484
I think you're a good person, renee.

568
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:18,351
I think something bad
happened to you,

569
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:19,850
And you were clever enough
to see a way out.

570
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:21,251
All right.

571
00:29:21,334 --> 00:29:23,850
Mmm.
You smell good.

572
00:29:23,933 --> 00:29:26,051
Oh, that's the rainstorm body spray.

573
00:29:26,134 --> 00:29:28,351
All right.
Let's make it look sexy.

574
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,151
Okay... ooh, easy.

575
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:31,451
<i>Not too sexy.</i>

576
00:29:31,534 --> 00:29:33,585
That'll cost us $20 million
next year.

577
00:29:33,668 --> 00:29:36,401
On the count of 2.
1... 2.

578
00:29:37,867 --> 00:29:39,685
I don't think you wanted to.

579
00:29:39,768 --> 00:29:42,933
I think you were afraid...
and lost and desperate.

580
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,784
You knew nathan
was in a contract year,

581
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:48,967
And you knew he had
too much to drink that night.

582
00:29:53,067 --> 00:29:55,084
Maybe someone lied to you,

583
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:58,117
Maybe someone took advantage
of you, or maybe...

584
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,167
Being a good person
just wasn't paying off.

585
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,784
I don't want to do this anymore.

586
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:08,833
I know.
But here's the good news.

587
00:30:11,334 --> 00:30:13,051
You can stop it...

588
00:30:13,134 --> 00:30:16,784
Right here, right now.

589
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:19,750
You wanted to get some money,
some security.

590
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:22,951
What's so little
to someone who has so much ?

591
00:30:23,034 --> 00:30:26,817
And then you got angry,
and then the press got involved,

592
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,167
And then there was no turning back.

593
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,817
Renee...

594
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,984
We have a team of experts backstage

595
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:37,151
Who study body language
and heart-rate response

596
00:30:37,234 --> 00:30:38,367
And all of it.

597
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:42,218
You were at that party that night,

598
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:43,434
And you had sex, didn't you ?

599
00:30:46,668 --> 00:30:48,401
And you got pregnant.

600
00:30:51,634 --> 00:30:54,084
But you didn't have sex
with nathan scott,

601
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:56,833
<i>and you never had sex
with nathan scott, did you ?</i>

602
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:04,634
No.

603
00:31:19,534 --> 00:31:22,318
Well, what do you know ?

604
00:31:22,401 --> 00:31:26,518
Character changes everything.

605
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:29,585
It's okay.

606
00:31:29,668 --> 00:31:31,251
It's okay.

607
00:31:31,334 --> 00:31:33,334
It's over now.

608
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:47,251
It's okay.

609
00:31:47,334 --> 00:31:49,334
It's over.

610
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:55,734
Thanks.

611
00:31:58,067 --> 00:31:59,801
He says she's dropping everything.

612
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:08,751
I'm so sorry
you had to go through this.

613
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:10,618
I shouldn't have been drunk
at that party, haley.

614
00:32:10,701 --> 00:32:11,718
I just...

615
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:13,651
You...

616
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:15,818
You're still young.

617
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:17,418
We both are.

618
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:19,684
I think...

619
00:32:19,767 --> 00:32:22,400
I think we just forget
that sometimes.

620
00:32:39,901 --> 00:32:42,418
What are you listening to ?

621
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:44,217
You know.

622
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,284
I never changed it.

623
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:48,801
Play it.

624
00:32:50,634 --> 00:32:52,284
I can't.

625
00:32:52,367 --> 00:32:54,200
For me ?

626
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:22,400
I love this song.

627
00:33:24,534 --> 00:33:25,818
You look beautiful.

628
00:33:25,901 --> 00:33:27,851
Well, thank you, handsome.

629
00:33:27,934 --> 00:33:29,267
Dance with me.

630
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:48,184
You know what i want ?

631
00:33:48,267 --> 00:33:50,751
What ?

632
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:52,534
Grape kool-aid.

633
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:11,050
You know what i hate ?

634
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,217
I hate these pens.

635
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,885
It's either way too much fluid

636
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,084
Or not nearly enough,

637
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:16,785
But it's never the right amount.

638
00:34:16,868 --> 00:34:19,234
And they cost, like, a fortune.

639
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:23,501
What are you looking at, you goof ?

640
00:34:24,634 --> 00:34:25,818
Sara, hey.

641
00:34:25,901 --> 00:34:27,400
Hey, sara ! Hey !

642
00:35:44,801 --> 00:35:47,534
Sometimes i can't see you anymore.

643
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,351
I forget things about you,

644
00:35:54,434 --> 00:35:57,167
And i'm afraid that i'm losing us.

645
00:35:58,601 --> 00:36:01,518
Like the way you smelled and, uh...

646
00:36:01,601 --> 00:36:04,351
The sound of your voice
and how you felt in my arms,

647
00:36:04,434 --> 00:36:05,751
And, um...

648
00:36:05,834 --> 00:36:08,684
If you let someone in,
you'll erase me.

649
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,384
You won't.

650
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:13,000
I can't.

651
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,367
Open the door, clay.

652
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,651
Clay...

653
00:36:23,734 --> 00:36:25,351
It's okay.

654
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:27,734
On the count of 2.

655
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:41,801
1... 2.

656
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,818
I think you need to go home.

657
00:36:50,901 --> 00:36:53,518
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was a bad time.

658
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:55,084
To david.

659
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:56,834
I think you should go home to david.

660
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,267
And i'm sorry, too.

661
00:37:10,901 --> 00:37:13,567
I love you so much,
my beautiful wife.

662
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,401
"A team of experts backstage" ?

663
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,018
Nice touch.

664
00:38:00,101 --> 00:38:03,067
So how'd you know she was lying ?

665
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:07,684
He's still my son.
I raised him.

666
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:10,417
I know what kind of man he is.

667
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,851
Besides...

668
00:38:11,934 --> 00:38:15,184
Takes a con to know a con.

669
00:38:15,267 --> 00:38:17,034
It was a good show.

670
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:20,134
I love you.

671
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:23,967
Yeah.

672
00:38:41,633 --> 00:38:43,584
You okay ?

673
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:46,001
No.

674
00:38:47,633 --> 00:38:51,051
I need to know that you feel
the same way that i do,

675
00:38:51,134 --> 00:38:55,385
That you can... see yourself
doing this with me forever,

676
00:38:55,468 --> 00:38:56,951
Because if not, what am i doing ?

677
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:59,385
<i>What... what are we doing ?
What...</i>

678
00:38:59,468 --> 00:39:00,717
Hey.
Who are we ?

679
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,134
Hey. Look at me.

680
00:39:05,067 --> 00:39:07,918
<i>We're us, brooke.</i>

681
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:12,251
You're the girl i love
with all my heart,

682
00:39:12,334 --> 00:39:15,434
And i'm the boy who's gonna be
with you forever.

683
00:39:17,934 --> 00:39:20,717
We don't have to rush into anything.

684
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,800
Forever is a very long time.

685
00:39:42,067 --> 00:39:45,218
It's not fair.

686
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:48,251
We were supposed to have more time.

687
00:39:48,334 --> 00:39:50,584
<i>And you still do.</i>

688
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:53,018
I don't want you to be alone, honey.

689
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:56,051
You like her... quinn.

690
00:39:56,134 --> 00:39:58,401
Why'd you send her away ?

691
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:03,851
I don't want to lose us.

692
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:07,951
No, you can't erase who we were
or what we had.

693
00:40:08,034 --> 00:40:09,434
No one can.

694
00:40:11,301 --> 00:40:13,934
We burned so bright together.

695
00:40:15,267 --> 00:40:17,251
You won't lose that.

696
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:20,151
I loved you so much, sara.

697
00:40:20,234 --> 00:40:23,684
You were perfect with me...

698
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:25,767
And you always will be.

699
00:40:28,434 --> 00:40:31,201
But now it's time to let go.

700
00:40:33,468 --> 00:40:35,967
It's okay, honey.

701
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:44,101
I love you.
