00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,630
previously  on "one tree hill"...

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,060
so,about the director
-- what do you want?

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,340
I want a director that
understands the characters.

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,740
That's what this movie's really about.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,520
- Let's go!Come on!
- Scott...

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,570
take a seat.

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,110
Get comfortable,15.

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,980
Get real comfortable.

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,240
- Uh,is peyton around?
- No.

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,890
You wouldn't by chance know how
to make a long island iced tea,wo

00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,930
***

12
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,410
- *******
- yo you like her.

13
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,960
- Do not.
- Do too.

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,380
This has to be business,right?

15
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,920
I mean,with peyton and...

16
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,120
this should be business.

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,800
We can't just -- I mean,I
kiss you,and thent gets...

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,310
- definitely.It would bE...
- it would bE.

19
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,360
Yes.

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,030
Announce chiefs basketball,and
we've got a close one.

24
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,580
The chiefs trail by one with
10 seconds left on the clock.

25
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,320
Let's bring it in,let's bring it in.

26
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,510
All right,huddle up!

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,820
Okay,guys,this is
it -- last play.

28
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,580
We're gonna go four-out swing rattle.

29
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,710
Spread the defense and isolate
23 at the top of the key.

30
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,020
Devon,you're gonna break down your maN.

31
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,180
If you get doubled up,you hit
rhodes cutting under the basket.

32
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,000
I got this.

33
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,750
All right.Here we go.

34
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,020
Everybody knows where
they're supposed to be.

35
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,010
Let's get
"chiefs" on 3 --

36
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,990
1,2,3.Chiefs!

37
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,930
You know where you're supposed to be,12?

38
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,150
Let's go! Let's go,baby!I got this!

39
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,730
What? Aw,come on!

40
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,030
Let's go,guys! Bring it home!

41
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,030
Here we go.10 seconds left.

42
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,800
Chiefs down by one.

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,360
They try tget the ball to devon fox.

44
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,440
He's got 33 points tonight.Chiefs
do get the ball inbounds.

45
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,600
Fox has it now,dribbling on top.

46
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,640
Four seconds lt,but fox
takes the shot instead...

47
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,940
Seven seconds now on the cck.And
rhodes breaks free under the basket!

48
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,520
********and it's no good!

49
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,210
And the chiefs lose a heartbreaker.

50
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,670
Yeah,a'ight.Now,who saw me throw down
that windmill in the third quarter,huh?

51
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,580
It was sick!

52
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,950
Somebody better put that on a poster.

53
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,570
That's all I'm saying.

54
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,640
You do realize we lost the game.

55
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,410
No.

56
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,470
You lost.

57
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,090
I had 33 points.

58
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,690
That's funny.Last time I
checked,it's a team sport.

59
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,010
You don't get it.

60
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,680
See,the nba only scouts
players who put up big numbers.

61
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,620
Tonight I did that,so i won!

62
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,730
And your ass is only here
to keep the bench warm.

63
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,480
Oh,is that right?

64
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,250
Yeah.

65
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,970
Yeah,that's right.

66
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,220
Is there a problem here?

67
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,720
No problem.

68
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,150
Just reminding your boy
here whose team this is.

69
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,350
Yeah.That's what I thought.

70
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,870
Yeah!

71
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,150
It's devon fox's house!

72
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,910
You know,there is this amazing
invention called the dishwasher.

73
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,660
Yeah.It's called "mE.

74
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,310
" Been doing it since
I was,what,jamie's age?

75
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,900
And besides,helps me think.

76
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,820
All right.

77
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,550
So,besides having a pregnant
fianc,what's going on in that head?

78
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,270
Ah,it's the movie.

79
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,850
Julian and I have met with
five different directorS.

80
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,280
Turned them all down.

81
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,810
Tomorrow we're meeting with the sixth.

82
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,190
Oh,yeah.And julian's dad's
coming to town tomorroW.

83
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,160
Apparently,he's not happy
with how selective I've been.

84
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,250
Okay.Well,then

85
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,680
,maybe director number six will
be the one you've been waiting for.

86
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,360
Well,they say he is A...

87
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,580
visionary.

88
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,220
That's a good thing,right?

89
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,770
Well,yeah.

90
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,010
Unless his vision is
different than mine.

91
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,480
Well,this is the first five-game
losing streak of my career.

92
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,230
I think I like winning better.

93
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,920
You didn't lose,daddy.Those losers did!

94
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,280
Somebody's a little fired up.

95
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,450
Yeah.You should have
seen him 20 minutes ago.

96
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,840
You know what,jamie?

97
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:37,030
I wear that uniform just like they do,so doesn't
matter if I'm playing or not,it's still my team.

98
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,890
We win as a team,and we lose as a teaM.

99
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,560
Remember that,okay?

100
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,810
Okay.

101
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,660
All right.

102
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,400
You okay?

103
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,370
I am now.

104
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,980
Good.Let's get you home.

105
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,150
This is so wrong...

106
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,880
but it's so right.

107
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,790
What am I gonna tell peyton?

108
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,140
I can't be on the couch,kissing you.

109
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:12,320
Well,okay,then maybe we should just continue
thisin your bedroom,preferably without our clothes.

110
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,140
We can'T.

111
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,550
I gave sam a very strict "no
boys in the bedroom" policy,

112
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,720
and I can't be one of
those hypocrite momS.

113
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,170
Hasn't sam already broken
that rule like five times?

114
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,380
Once.

115
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,940
Okay,then that means you're
allowed to break it once.

116
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,410
- It's only fair,right?
- No.

117
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,570
That grin should be illegal.

118
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,600
This is bad.

119
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,450
But it's gooD.

120
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,910
Okay.

121
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,060
well,just so I'm clear on these newly amended
rules,I'm not allowed to have boys in the bedroom,

122
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,220
but it's okay if I fool around
with them out here on the coucH.

123
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,170
Is that correct?

124
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,790
I think you should repeal the
"no boys in the bedroom" rule.

125
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,000
You stay out of this.

126
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,920
I'm with juliaN.

127
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,840
You're killing me,sam.

128
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,390
I know.

129
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,060
I'llave my headphones
on tonight,just in case.

130
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,610
Good night.

131
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,550
Oh,my god.

132
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,070
It's not funny!

133
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:30,160
Okay.Okay,maybe we should just continue
this in your bedroom,preferably...

134
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,600
without our clothes.

135
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,380
Yeah.

136
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,600
RighT.

137
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,520
Should I be following you?

138
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,700
I'll just let myself out.

139
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,460
Tell me what you see.

140
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,630
Where is the soul
hidden within this image?

141
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,920
I don't know what that means.

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,990
I think he's talking to himself.

143
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,380
I'm just curious,but what the
hell are we doing in a junkyard?

144
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,590
There.

145
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,500
That's lucas' house.

146
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,610
It's perfect.

147
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,170
No,no.It's,uh...

148
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,200
I didn't grow up here.

149
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,390
You know,I-I actually
had a pretty normal house.

150
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,490
Boring!There's no drama in "normal.

151
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,700
" I'm going for "8
mile" here.I want gritty.

152
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,800
I'm thinking the entire movie should
be shot with a handheld camera.

153
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,090
Look,pete,we want to keep
in mind this is a true story.

154
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,260
You know,it's okay to have
a vision -- we love that.

155
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,760
We -- we just don't want
to rewrite history herE.

156
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,120
This is the only place I can see
our climactic scene happening!

157
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:58,820
This is the spot where lucas' rival gang
kills his uncle keith in a drive-by shooting!

158
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,650
Okay.

159
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,610
I'm done here.

160
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,840
So,doc,tell me the truth.

161
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,560
What are the chances of another
heart becoming available?

162
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,960
Same as they were
before -- not great.

163
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,120
Well,that's comforting.

164
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,450
Don't give up pe.

165
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:26,450
Just remember,even with those odds the
last time,we were able to find you a hearT.

166
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,320
And it ended up going to someone elsE.

167
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,620
Yes.

168
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,500
It saved a man's lifE.

169
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,560
Well,we could just ask for
it back,tell him we had dibs.

170
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,760
I'm afraid not.

171
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,780
Didn't think so.

172
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,160
I said,"shut up!

173
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,550
Just do yourself a favor.

174
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,690
Thisime when it goes off,call us.

175
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,320
Okay.

176
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,200
I'll try to avoid being
kidnapped by some crazy bitcH.

177
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,470
All you can do now is waiT.

178
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,540
Devon makes that pass,we win the game.

179
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,960
Maybe.

180
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,350
I wanted to talk to
you about playing time.

181
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,190
Nathan,you've been he five minutes.

182
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,280
You're still learning the
offense,not to mention a new position.

183
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,790
I know.

184
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,090
And if the team were winning,we
wouldn't be having this conversatioN.

185
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,430
You play the same position as
the best player on this teaM.

186
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,270
Devon scored 33 points last night.

187
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:40,200
And he had one assist,and that was
off of an air ball they called a pass.

188
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,830
Look,the job of the point guard is
to get the rest of the team involved.

189
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,430
So,unless he learns to pass the
ball,this team's gonna keep losinG.

190
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,350
I-I've seen it beforE.

191
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,780
You know what you
sounded like just then?

192
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,000
A coacH.

193
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,610
But you turned down that job,remember?

194
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,820
Just gonna have  wait your turn,natE.

195
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,200
Here.

196
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,850
Take this.

197
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,060
That's some of our new offensive sets.

198
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:15,190
We'll see how they sink in,then maybe
we'll talk about some playing time.

199
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,860
My number's in there if
you have any questionS.

200
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,980
Yeah.

201
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,810
Thanks,coacH.

202
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,930
Is that a new hat?

203
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,600
Yeah.Why?

204
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,460
No reason.

205
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,740
Am I not pulling it off?

206
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,120
Nah,it's fine.

207
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,490
No.If it was fine,you wouldn't have
mentioned it.It would just blend in.

208
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,230
Okay.

209
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,550
Let's hear it.

210
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,460
What was wro with this director?

211
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,210
- Too short?Too tl?
- Too idiot.

212
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,700
This is getting old,lucas.

213
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,880
No,dad.Lucas is right.

214
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,710
This guy was not a good fit.

215
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,910
Julian,you've been calling me "paul" since you
were 15,so don't start withhe "dad" crap noW.

216
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,100
Lucas: All right,look.

217
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,630
These directors that you've sent us --
they are all extremely talented,all right?

218
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,170
They are.They're just not
what we're looking for.

219
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,150
Well,I'm sorry to hear that.

220
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,200
It's time for me to step in.

221
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,580
I have sent you six directors.Any
one of them could make this movie.

222
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,140
So it's real simple.

223
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,650
Pick one.

224
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,690
I don't care which one it iS.

225
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,480
Because if you don't,then I'm gonna
take that stupid hat off of julian's head

226
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,480
and I'm gonna put all
six choices inside of it

227
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,590
and I'm gonna reach in and I'm
gonna choose your director for yoU.

228
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,540
Now,if you don't like that idea,you have
until tomorrow to decide for yourself.

229
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,490
Understood?

230
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,080
I'l trstilying to figure out how I
ended up with such a talented wife.

231
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,220
You just got lucky.

232
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,830
No.Getting lucky's how I got a soN.

233
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,820
So,how'd it go with the coach?

234
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,070
It looks like I won't
be playing any time soon.

235
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,990
Aw.Sorry,natE.

236
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,320
It's okay.

237
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,980
I think you and jamie should
skip the next few games,though.

238
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,380
I don't want to let him down.

239
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,780
Let him down?You're his hero.

240
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,850
Exactly.I...

241
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,910
it can't be easy to watch
your hero sit on the bench.

242
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,890
Maybe we go to those games to
support you,whether you play or noT.

243
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,700
And besides,I think it's important
for our son to see you not giving uP.

244
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,600
Maybe you're right.

245
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,390
I am.

246
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,590
Besides,we're a team,right?

247
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,390
We win together,and we lose together.

248
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,130
Right.

249
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,470
Where did you disappear to last night?

250
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,490
I was waiting for you in my bed.

251
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,840
- That's not funny.
- Yes,t is.

252
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,020
Check it out.

253
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,620
For the movie.What do you think?

254
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,000
Very authentic.

255
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,800
Well,not yet.

256
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,430
I have to age them down a little
and put some patches on them,

257
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,470
but I've had some experience
with letterman jackets.

258
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,010
I'm sure you havE.

259
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:20,510
Oh,like you didn't have all the girls in
your high school just begging to wear yours?

260
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,290
No,I didn't play sports in high school.

261
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,140
I never had a letterman jacket.

262
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,610
Really?

263
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,270
Well...

264
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,090
now you do.

265
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,020
- Did you make this for me?
- Yep.

266
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,150
And look at that.

267
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,450
You lettered all four years in footbalL.

268
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,970
Not bad for someone
who never played sports.

269
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,870
Thanks,brooke.

270
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,820
You're welcome.

271
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:45,950
I'll see you later.

272
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,400
Okay.

273
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,480
Really,brooke?

274
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,300
What?You two are totally having sex!

275
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,570
No,we're not.

276
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,490
You so are!I can sense it!

277
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,130
Well,then,your senses are
off,because we are not having sex.

278
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,830
And how much would
you hate me if we were?

279
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,320
No,I wouldn't hate you.

280
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,250
I mean,I know how he is.He's
smart,and he's charming,

281
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:11,840
and he gets into a lot of beds with
that little scoundrel grin of hiS.

282
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,640
Yeah,I know that grin.

283
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,360
All right,well,there's
something else you should know.

284
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,320
The weekend that he broke up with me,he
just jumped into bed with somebody else,okay?

285
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:27,050
He flew off to sundance,slept with some actress
before I could even wipe away the tears,you know?

286
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,740
It was all in the tabloids.

287
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,630
And that's when I realized
what a bad guy he is.

288
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,960
You know,I just couldn't
figure it out until then.

289
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,320
So I want you to be careful,all right?

290
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:41,550
'Cause the second this movie's over,he's gonna
be off on another movie with a new conquest.

291
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:47,040
And before you know it,that charming
guy with the sweet grin disappears.

292
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,490
That's just who he iS.

293
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,870
*******

294
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,670
what are you doing?

295
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,650
Haley,will you marry me?

296
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,650
That is so creepy on so many levels.

297
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,730
Yeah,well,that's how that,uh,crazy
director in L.A.Wanted to end the movie.

298
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,330
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

299
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,820
Do you think peyton will like it?

300
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,000
I don't know,luke.Girls usually
hate getting big diamonds.

301
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,960
I think she'll love it.

302
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:29,040
It's just,i...I always pictured
you giving her keith's rinG.

303
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,220
It meant so much to you.

304
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,490
The truth is,is I always
hoped she'd wear that ring,too.

305
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,690
So why did you buy this one?

306
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,910
Well,because I gave
keith's ring to lindseY.

307
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,570
She gave it back to you.

308
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,130
Yeah.I just wasn't sure if
she'd want it after that.

309
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,560
So I figured,you know,couldn't
go wrong with a new ring.

310
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,040
All right.

311
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,750
Oh,luke,it's stuck.

312
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,500
Well,I guess I'll just
have to keep it now.Sorry.

313
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,000
Did you forget something?

314
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,680
No.I just couldn't stay away.

315
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,710
Is everything okay?

316
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,200
YeS.

317
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,950
No.I don't know.

318
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,740
Well,which is it -- "yes,"
"no," or,"I don't know"?

319
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,750
I don't know.

320
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:25,430
Look,the last thing that I want to do is make it
awkward between us,but I need to know somethinG.

321
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,830
Is this going anywhere?

322
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,700
This conversation?I have
no idea.I'm completely lost.

323
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,230
I'm being serious,juliaN.

324
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:37,870
This -- you and me -- what
are we -- what are we doing?

325
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,250
I don't know.We're hanging
ouT.We're having fun.

326
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,240
Right.

327
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,210
Pretty much what I
expected your answer to be.

328
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,950
What's wrong with having fun?

329
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,460
NothinG.

330
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,290
And in the past,I would
have been fine with a fling.

331
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,700
And I'm sorry that you missed
out on that version of me.

332
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,460
But my situation has changed.

333
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,400
I'm really trying to set
a good example for sam,

334
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:08,940
and I just don't know how to
explain "just having fun" to her.

335
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,730
So this is about sam.

336
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,210
Sam,me...

337
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,900
Peyton?

338
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,500
Does it really matter?

339
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,590
I mean,we both know you're gonna
leave when the movie's oveR.

340
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,660
There it is.

341
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,820
Okay.

342
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,590
Well,maybe we should just slow
it down,focus on the movie.

343
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,280
And by "slow down," you
mean "slam on the brakeS.

344
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,070
"Brooke,it sounds to me like you slammed
on the brakes before I came in here.

345
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,540
But you know what?It's
okay.Whatever you want it to be.

346
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,260
What's that,grandpa?

347
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,240
That's the thing that makes noise
when it's time for me to get better.

348
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,300
When is it supposed to make the noise?

349
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,470
Wish I knew.

350
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,020
Me too.

351
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,150
So,tell me,how's your dad?

352
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,430
He finally made the team,but
he never gets to play.

353
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,010
The team's not very good.

354
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,940
- They always lose.
- Well,that's okaY.

355
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,480
He always rises to the top,you know?

356
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,980
It's not just about x's and o'S.It's about
heart,and your dad has plenty of that.

357
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,570
So don't worry.

358
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,310
Did you hear that?

359
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,270
I think it made a sounD.

360
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,070
Not just yet,buddy.

361
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,390
But when it does,you'll
be the first to know.

362
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,640
- Eat your ice cream.
- Okay.

363
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,030
I want to play a song for you.

364
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,490
Cool.Let's hear it.

365
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,380
But this is good,too.

366
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,190
All right.I'm gonna go sit over therE...

367
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,270
in a seconD.

368
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,620
Go play me your song,goof.

369
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,930
Okay.

370
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,970
So,I'm a little nervous.

371
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,720
I thought you did this for a living.

372
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,530
Yeah,but this is different.No
one's ever heard this before.

373
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,990
So I'm gonna be your first.

374
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,390
We'll see.

375
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,390
So,remember when we were talking the
other night about flying over a city

376
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,980
and how things look
different from a distance?

377
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,360
Well,you kind of
inspired me to write this.

378
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,930
So,promise you'll lie and say
you love it if you hate it.

379
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,070
I can do that.

380
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,990
I can be a good liar for you.

381
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,460
Well,hopefully,you won't have to be.

382
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,330
we're stopping.Why are we stopping?

383
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,210
Look where we are.

384
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,500
Luke,it's our spot.

385
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,540
We haven't been here in years!

386
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,100
I have.

387
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,610
When you were in L.A.,I
used to come here sometimes.

388
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,280
We're using this as a
location in the movie.

389
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,130
Pretty good moment in our relationshiP.

390
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,960
Yeah.It was the beginning.

391
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,380
You were so cute in
your little tow truck.

392
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,060
Yeah,and you were so mean to me.

393
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,590
Remember?Irst of all,you don't know mE.

394
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,610
" "Second of all,you don't know mE.

395
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,630
" And in my defense,you
really didn't know mE.

396
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,940
Oh,yes,I did.

397
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,960
I always knew you.

398
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,980
I have something for you.

399
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,280
Now,we're already engaged,so I don't know if
I'm supposed to get down on one knee,but...

400
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,310
oh,myod.

401
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,940
- Is that for me?
- YeS.

402
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,960
Do you like it?

403
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,160
Like it? It's beautiful.

404
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,550
I am so glad you always knew me.

405
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,500
It's a good thing to see you
haven't lost your shooting toucH.

406
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,600
So,I heard your team's
lost five straighT.

407
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,310
I know how that feels.

408
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,800
Actually,I don'T.

409
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,200
Did you come here just to rub it in?

410
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,740
No.I came to tell you that
losing has its advantages.

411
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,210
Here we go.

412
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:56,150
Some classic dan scott advice that
doesn't apply to normal people.

413
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,740
I'm all ears.What do you got for me?

414
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,230
Losing always forces change,nathan.

415
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,980
Your time's coming.

416
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,890
I don't know about thaT.

417
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,460
Best guy on the team
plays in front of me.

418
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,530
Oh,you know what i call the
best player on a losing team.

419
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,770
- A loser.
- Bingo.A loser.

420
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:17,230
Right now,you're playing on his team,but
pretty soon,he's gonna be playing on yours.

421
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,430
I'm not so sure about that.

422
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,430
You're gonna get your
chance,nathan.We both know that.

423
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,030
The thing is,when you
do,will you be ready?

424
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,960
Will you make the most of it?

425
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,960
See this?

426
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,180
This thing's gonna decide whether
or not I get a second chancE.

427
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,310
And I promise you...

428
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,220
If I do,I'm gonna make the most of it.

429
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:49,000
Right now,all you can do is wait.

430
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,310
Can I help you?

431
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,630
Paul!

432
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,100
Oh,god,I was hoping I was gonna
see you while you were in town!

433
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,260
Your assistant let me in.

434
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,840
- My assistant?
- Yeah,mia.

435
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,070
Cute little brunette.

436
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,480
Oh,god,no.That's not my assistanT.

437
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,880
That,um -- that is just an
overly trusting recording artist.

438
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,750
It's a good thing you're
not a serial killer.

439
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,520
We actually have those
here in tree hill.

440
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,970
I heard.

441
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,410
So,look at you.

442
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,270
You've become this big success.

443
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,380
And most importantly,you look happy.

444
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,810
I'm kind of having a good day.

445
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,690
Not bad.

446
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,740
Lucas has good taste
in jewelry and fianc.

447
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,260
His taste in directors,however,is
still in question.

448
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,640
I am staying way out of that argument.

449
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,930
That's probably a good ideA.

450
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,200
It's good to see you,peyton.

451
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,090
How long has it been?

452
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,400
I mean...

453
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,130
I mean,it was before sundance.

454
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,690
Um,god,that was hard to forgeT.I
spent that whole weekend crying.

455
00:23:54,590 --> 00:24:01,350
You know,my son has made a few mistakes in his
life,but letting you get away easily tops the list.

456
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,040
The breakup was not hard
on julian.He was fine.

457
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:08,540
In fact,I remember reading about him and that little
a-list actress of his that weekend in sundance.

458
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,710
Peyton,you can't believe everything
you read in hollywood -- you know that.

459
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,960
Paul,are you covering for him?

460
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,100
Actually,no,because
I planted that story.

461
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,090
I was trying to promote a movie.

462
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,250
Julian didn't even go to sundance.

463
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,290
He skipped his own movie
premiere,he was so heartbroken.

464
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:30,770
To be honest,I'm not sure
he's ever fully recovereD.

465
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,140
Nice digs you got here.

466
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:44,190
do you really think one of
these guys can make this movie?

467
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,260
They can all make the movie.

468
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:49,690
The question is,which one of
them will screw it up the least.

469
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,320
So that's our goal here?

470
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,580
Find the best of the worst,huh?

471
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,400
That is the plan,yeS.

472
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,180
Fair enough.So,who's your first choice?

473
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,710
All right,hear me out,'cause you're
gonna think I'm a little crazy,

474
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,420
but I got to go with
the british director.

475
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,600
Really?

476
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,330
The guy made an incest
movie with sock puppets.

477
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,070
Yeah,but you got to admit,it
had a certain style to it.

478
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:11,170
And tell me you wouldn't want to
see a little sock-puppet lucas.

479
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,100
Come on,admit it.

480
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,410
Whatcha doing,daddy?

481
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,140
Just doing a little homework.

482
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,790
There's homework in bastball?

483
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,360
Sure,there is.

484
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,840
When I g on the court,I
want to be ready,right?

485
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,970
Do you think you're ever gonna play?

486
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,480
I hope so.

487
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,810
It's up to the coach,though.

488
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,080
Is he mean?

489
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,390
No,he's not mean.He's just...

490
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,920
just doing what he thinks
is best for the team.

491
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,470
You know what?I have an idea.

492
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,390
Why don't you help me learn some of
these plays?I could really use your helP.

493
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,990
Really?Okay,I'll help.

494
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,510
Awesome.Come here.

495
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,660
All right,see this play?

496
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,910
That's called a four-out
swing rattle,all right?

497
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,450
- That's when four players
- so,you can't play until the coach wants you to?

498
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,780
Yeah.

499
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,000
I just have to wait until then.

500
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:10,170
All right.So,this play,I'm just gonna come
down here,and I'm going to dribble this way.

501
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,210
I want one of thosE.

502
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:19,540
Well,I will make you one,but
you are just gonna have to wait.

503
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,340
Julian didn't have to wait.

504
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,320
Is that what he told you --
that I didn't make him wait?

505
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:30,410
No,I came to tluconcsion when
he showed me his new jacket.

506
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,010
Right.

507
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,970
- Brooke,are you and julian
- no,not at all.

508
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:44,820
Okay,up until today,we were "having fun --" his
words,not mine -- but it ended before it started.

509
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,130
He didn't tell you?

510
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,540
No.

511
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:52,720
Since I don't really like julian,we try to
keep our conversations strictly aut the movie.

512
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,610
Right. How is that going?

513
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:02,000
Oh,well,the director I met today wanted to make lucas
a gang member and have him living in a junkyard.Yeah.

514
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,420
Sounds gritty?

515
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,330
Oh,but he did want to put
brooke in a mansion in charlotte.

516
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,540
Now,that is a movie I would go see.

517
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,620
Luke...

518
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,830
you don't have to compromise,not
if you don't want to.

519
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:25,790
The worst thing that could happen is for this movie
to fail because they went with someone else's vision.

520
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,890
What do I do,brooke?

521
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,880
Do whatever it takes.

522
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,590
Just make sure they tell the
story the way you remember it.

523
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,660
- Come in!
- Mama,I need to use the phone.

524
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,780
Well,okay,but who are
you calling,little man?

525
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,970
Guess what I'm holding!

526
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,270
It looks like a cd.

527
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,260
Oh,it is,but what's on it?

528
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,610
Barry manilow.

529
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,000
It's mia's new song.

530
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,960
Since when does mia have a new song?

531
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,010
Since now.It's great.

532
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,810
Give it!

533
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,480
Hi,this is jat.

534
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,150
E scot we need to talk.

535
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,340
Oh,I see lucas gave you the ring!

536
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,680
What,you knew about it?

537
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,520
Yeah.He proposed to me with it
first,but I just had to turn him down.

538
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,550
Lucky me.

539
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,930
Well,it's definitely beautiful.

540
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,390
You don't sound very convincing.

541
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,750
No,I love it.

542
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,950
I dO.

543
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,650
I just -- I always envisioned
wearing keith's ring.

544
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:26,820
Okay,I'm gonna tell you something,and you
have to swear that you did not hear it from mE.

545
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,590
I promise.

546
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,420
Lucas really wanted to
give you keith's ring.

547
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:35,540
He just thought you wouldn't want it
since he already gave it to lindsey.

548
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,290
So,you see,it's not
all about x's and o'S.

549
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,770
It's about heart.

550
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,800
I just think you should
really think about that.

551
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,370
I will.

552
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,270
You have a good night,jamie.

553
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:58,400
- I thought we agreed on the bri
- well,I changed my min

554
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,560
well,paul wants an answer today.

555
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,110
He'll get one.

556
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,940
Well,what are we gonna tell him?

557
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,190
I haven't exactly
figured that out yet,okay?

558
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:11,010
Oh,okay.Well,when you do figure it
out,I'm only the producer of the movie.

559
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,560
Who's this?

560
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,730
You've got to be kidding me.

561
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,830
Lucas scott,you son of a bitch!

562
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,230
Thanks,argyle.Hang tight.

563
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,790
- My name is jason.
- Rent "die hard.

564
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,170
" It'll change your life.

565
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,510
What are you doing here,adam?

566
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,710
My agent tells me you guys are still having
some trouble finding a director for this movie.

567
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:36,080
I thought maybe I would come by and
give you two dorks another chance.

568
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,030
I have a surprise for you.

569
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,610
Voil?

570
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,920
Think I finally perfted
the long island iced tea.

571
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,800
That took a little longer
than it should havE.

572
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,120
Just sayinG.

573
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,060
Promise me one thing?

574
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,050
Even if you hate it,you'll
lie and say you love iT.

575
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,620
Okay.

576
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,210
It's good.

577
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,750
Not greaT.

578
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,800
I'm just kidding.I love iT.

579
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:13,730
But I'm also underage,and before I get you arrested,I
think you should probably get back to the baR...

580
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,620
...right after I kiss you again.

581
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,810
I think you've perfected that,toO.

582
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,010
Okay.

583
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,060
I know what you guys are thinking.

584
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,560
You're thinking about fast
food,beer,and getting laid.

585
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,200
That's pretty much what i was thinking.

586
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,940
It's like he read my mind.

587
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,310
I respect that!

588
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,650
I do.I respect that.

589
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,680
But you guys are also
thinking about your movie.

590
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:43,810
And I didn't fly all the way out here just so I
could nail some flight attendant on the plane...

591
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,860
even though I did that.

592
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,070
[ Laughs ] How'd she look?

593
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,060
Solid six,but that's not important.

594
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,410
What important...

595
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,160
is why I should be directing this film.

596
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,370
Now,lucas,you wrote a good
script,but that's not enough.

597
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,800
What you two need
is a director --

598
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:04,950
someone who can take your vision and
translate it onto the big screen,baby!

599
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,870
A director who knows when a scene isn't
working,a director who can adapt to any situation.

600
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:13,200
Gentlemen,that's what i do.

601
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,700
That's what I know.

602
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:20,910
Bottom line -- the three of us are gonna get
more ass than a toilet seat in yankee stadiuM.

603
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,880
Are you finished?

604
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,650
Depends if I have the job or not.

605
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,600
Okay,um...

606
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,700
let me tell you why you're
not gonna direct this moviE.

607
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:36,950
Because you can't
identify with this world.

608
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:42,680
I mean,I want a director who
can re-create the feeling that

609
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,800
i get every time I step out
onto the river court at night.

610
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,610
I want someone who can
explain to the audience

611
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:54,720
why one song can instantly
change peyton's mood,

612
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:58,680
someone who can recognize that there are two
completely different sides to brooke davis,

613
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,390
both of which are amazing.

614
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:10,910
I want a director who can make
the little thingsthe big things.

615
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:16,140
And you are just not the guy to do that.

616
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,640
I suck.

617
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,740
True,but why this time?

618
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:34,180
Okay,all that stuff that
I told you about julian --

619
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:38,280
I just found out that some of my
facts were not entirely accurate.

620
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,560
Like which facts?

621
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,820
Pretty much all of theM.

622
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,870
He didn't go and sleep with some
other girl the weekend we broke up.

623
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,510
In fact,he missed his
own movie premiere.

624
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:54,150
So it seems there is a possibility that julian
really is the nice guy I thought he was after all.

625
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,240
Well,thank you for that,but none
of that changes the fact that

626
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:01,710
you and I have been through way too
much for me to violate the girl code now.

627
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,510
Oh,my god,brooke."Girl code"?

628
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,380
I'm engaged to your ex-boyfriend.

629
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:11,170
You are so exempt from the
girl code,it's not even funny.

630
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,920
Nathan: Hey,devon,you got a second?

631
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,490
Want an autograph,12,wait
till after the game.

632
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,250
You're going heads-up
with alex beck tonight.

633
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,740
He's a good defender.Quick ndS.

634
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,170
I'm gonna eat that fool up.

635
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,480
I hope so,but he's leading
the league in steals.

636
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,680
You usually go right off the dribble.

637
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,730
He's gonna be ready for that.

638
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,530
Are you giving me tips?

639
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,040
I'm just trying to
give you an advantage.

640
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,850
I already got an advantage.

641
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,240
It's called my god-given talent.

642
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,900
So go sit on the bench
and enjoy the show.

643
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:44,180
Okay.

644
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,590
You do your thinG.

645
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:49,630
But after he picks your pocket a few
times,you might want to switch to your left.

646
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:02,320
So,who's the lucky one,lucas?

647
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:07,300
Well,first off,I just want you to know
that we have given this a lot of thought.

648
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,420
That being said,we've
decided to choosE...

649
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,290
none of them.

650
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,360
Not the answer that I wanted to hear.

651
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,050
I know.

652
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,020
So you know what I have to do now,right?

653
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,020
Look,I just -- I just
believe we can do better.

654
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:27,920
That may be true,but time's up.

655
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,160
Well,this feels like
d?vu all over again.

656
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,870
We're all tied up.Nine seconds left.

657
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,450
Let's bring it in.Let's bring it in.

658
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,500
This is it.

659
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,530
Time's up.Tie game.Last play.

660
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,740
Here's what we're gonna do.

661
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,790
Rhodes,set a high scree for devon.

662
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,970
Hit your spot.Devon,you're gonna find rhodes
cutting across the lane.You get him the ball.

663
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,870
Wait.You're calling the play for rhodes?

664
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,890
Devon,everybody in the building
thinks you're taking the last shot.

665
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,170
That's because I am!

666
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,670
I'm here to put the ball in the basket.

667
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,200
You're here to help this team wiN.

668
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,650
Whatever.

669
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,650
Look,I'm taking the lost
shot,or I'm taking a seat.

670
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,960
Your call.

671
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,000
Okay.

672
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,390
Take a seaT.

673
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,370
Scott,you're in.

674
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,940
You know where you're supposed to be?

675
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,030
Yes,sir.Know exactly
where I'm supposed to be.

676
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,640
What I want toeaR.Let's run

679
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,050
Yeah!

680
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,720
paul.

681
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,860
Appreciate you meeting me.

682
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,310
You got two minuteS.

683
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,080
Tell me why you should
direct this moviE.

684
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:19,720
My movies have made a lot of money
for a lot of studios,including yours.

685
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,820
But I look at my rum?

686
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,070
and there's something missing.

687
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:30,320
I've yet to make that one quality
movie,the one I'm proud of.

688
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,870
I think this can be that movieand...

689
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,900
because I identify with this world.

690
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,730
I understand the feeling lucas gets every
time he steps on the river court at night.

691
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:52,890
I can show the audience how a song
can instantly change peyton's mood.

692
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,830
I recognize that there are two completely
different sides to brooke davis,

693
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,050
both of which are amazing.

694
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,760
I want to make the little
things the big things,paul.

695
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,940
I'm the guy to do it.

696
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,290
I hope you don't mind me coming.

697
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,560
I kind of had a feeling about tonighT.

698
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,980
Well,I didn't exactly
light up the box score.

699
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,210
Zero points,zero rebounds...

700
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,850
one assist.

701
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,820
Best stat of the night.

702
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,210
You know,I knew you'd make it.

703
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,240
And I know I don't
get to be part of it...

704
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,090
but I am so proud of you,soN.

705
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,200
Can I talk to you?

706
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,700
Yeah.

707
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,040
Sure.Is everything okay?

708
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:54,980
Come here.

709
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,200
What's up?

710
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,040
I can't accept this ring.

711
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,370
I mean,it's beautiful,and I love it.

712
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,730
I just -- it's not the
ring that I want to weaR.

713
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,520
I always dreamed I'd be wearing keith's
ring,and I know how much it means to you,

714
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,200
so that's the ring I want to
wear for the rest of my life.

715
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,330
You sure?

716
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,990
now it's right where it belongs.

717
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,330
And it will be forever.

718
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,390
I want you to have this.

719
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,410
And what is this supposed to mean?

720
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,580
It means we're going steady.

721
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,570
This isn't a game,julian.

722
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,720
I know.

723
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:28,250
When I first got here,everyone thought
I came for a girl --the girl in the book.

724
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:31,520
But I only came here to make a moviE.

725
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:35,780
But now it turns out everyone was right.

726
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:40,820
I am here for the girl in
the book --the other girl.

727
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:02,080
maybe we should continue
this in my bedroom...

728
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:05,550
preferably without our clotheS.

729
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,230
You son of a bitch!

730
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,150
What do you want,reese?

731
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:22,530
I just wanted to come by and
give you the good news myself.

732
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,760
I'm directing the moviE.

733
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:28,520
Done!

734
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:29,810
I signed on tonight!

735
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,160
You and I are gonna have some fun.

736
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:36,630
Oh,I've got a couple thoughts
about that last scene.

737
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,410
Don't worry about
it.We'll talk tomorroW...

738
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,780
partneR.
