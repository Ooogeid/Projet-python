4
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,540
All right, guys, bring it in.

5
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,050
It has been way too long since we all hung out together, 

6
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,600
and this is the first time we're all drinking together -- legally, that is.

7
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,440
So, here's to hanging with our crew --

8
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,380
the old and the new --

9
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,540
and to everyone getting what they want.

10
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,900
Haley: I guess one shot won't kill us, huh?

11
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,990
Maybe it will.

12
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,660
Brooke, what was that?

13
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,670
I wanted something that would remind everyone of me, 
so they mixed their most popular liquor with their sweetest.

14
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,920
The bartender did name it a "brooke davis.

15
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,530
" Isn't that right?

16
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,320
Actually, I think you named it that.

17
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,100
I call it tequila and grenadine.

18
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,470
- It's disgusting. - yeah.

19
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,020
You know, not many people can handle a brooke davis.

20
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,840
Well, it's definitely one of a kind.

21
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,880
I don't know about the old crew, 
but the new crew is ready to go home.

22
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,470
I thought you wanted to see the honorary title.

23
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,390
I thought I could handle being around peyton -- 
who hates me, by the way -- but I was wrong.

24
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,360
Look, tric's a big place, okay? 
Avoiding her shouldn't be too difficult.

25
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,720
Oh, I'll have no problem avoiding her.

26
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,720
It's you I'm worried about.

27
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,080
- thank you - Here you go.

28
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,690
Water?

29
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,530
I wasn't even planning on 
drinking until brooke forced her.

30
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,510
self on us.

31
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,980
It's my turn to be responsible for a change.

32
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,720
You know, you've really come 
a long way in the last month, and.

33
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,660
I'm glad to have you back. So is jamie.

34
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,960
oh, really

35
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,940
How come I wasn't invited to hang 
out with him and the guys, then?

36
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,510
Skills has been really strict about this "no parent" rule.

37
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:03,600
And besides, jamie's sleepover means you and i have 
the house to ourselves for a little, um, private afterparty.

38
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,800
My own personal champagne room?

39
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,310
Yeah.

40
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,350
- Except you're the stripper. - Oh.

41
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,020
- Jack and coke, bro. - You got it.

42
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,200
Coach and teach.

43
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,840
What y'all two doin' here, man?

44
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
We should be asking you the same thing.

45
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,600
Me? Nah.

46
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,240
I'm just taking a study break from "les mis.

47
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,910
" Well, don't stay out too late. We got an early-morning practice.

48
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,260
Oh, all work and no player?

49
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,420
Come on, man.

50
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,100
Ain't I been on time for every practice?

51
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,890
Yeah. You have been good.

52
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,520
What can I say, man? I'm learning from the best.

53
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,460
You could learn a lot more from nathan than just basketball.

54
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,860
- Hey. - Hey.

55
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,340
Thanks for the invite.

56
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,570
I'm usually at home online on saturday nights.

57
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,020
Okay, we're gonna have to work on your rock-star image.

58
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,680
Well, this should help. I can't tell you how much I love the honorary title.

59
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,110
Oh, good.

60
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,860
How would you like to open for them?

61
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,060
When?

62
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,260
- Tonight? - Yeah.

63
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,470
It's one song -- one song to open up.

64
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,390
And I didn't even have to unbutton a button.

65
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,790
Why didn't you give me any notice?

66
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,470
I'm not ready. I look awful.

67
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,470
I don't even have a band, peyton.

68
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,860
This is why I didn't tell you -- I was scared you were gonna run off and disappear again.

69
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,410
But you look great.

70
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,880
And you can warm up in my office, and the house band will back you.

71
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,920
I hate you.

72
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,160
Hey! Where have you been?

73
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,910
Closing the store, when victoria came in and made me take inventory.

74
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,060
Don't get upset, but I may have let it slip that I was meeting you here.

75
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,470
We have more important things to worry about, like your big date.

76
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,400
I think you look great, but we need an impartial opinion.

77
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,180
Hey, owen!

78
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,960
Yeah, yeah. Hi, hi.

79
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,270
How does she look? Hot, right?

80
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,840
She's wearing a clothes over bro's original.

81
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,230
You're the prettiest girl in the room.

82
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,750
Did you hear that, milly? You're the second-prettiest girl in the room.

83
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,050
I can't wait to see the look on mouth's face when he finds out he's on a date with you.

84
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,900
He doesn't know it's a date?

85
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,100
Relax. Owen doesn't know we're on a date, either, but that's not stopping me.

86
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,670
Hey, owen.

87
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,620
Thanks.

88
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,470
- Hey, you. - Hey.

89
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,620
- You look nice. - Ah, thanks.

90
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,980
I keep thinking it's gonna fall off.

91
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,650
Where's haley?

92
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,800
I think she's in the ladies' room.

93
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,270
Hey. Two shots.

94
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,270
- How's tequila?  - Good.

95
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,190
I'm not drinking tonight.

96
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,230
Do you need to use the ladies' room, too?

97
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,090
I'm trying to be good.

98
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,580
Oh.

99
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,940
I'm not.

100
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,300
What's this?

101
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,430
Rent. Sorry it's late.

102
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,500
- You don't have to do that. - No, I really do.

103
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,010
Well, I'm not taking it.

104
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,470
Fine.

105
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,180
I'll mail it.

106
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,600
What was that about?

107
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,310
She had a rent check for me. I didn't take it.

108
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,750
Why not?

109
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,930
I don't feel right accepting money from peyton, all right? We've been friends for too long.

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,110
I hate to break it to you, but most guys aren't friends with their exes.

111
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,570
Peyton's different. Look, I know I said we could try avoiding her, but.

112
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,870
maybe we should work this thing out.

113
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,040
At least say something to her.

114
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,780
Fine. Let's go.

115
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,780
You know when you said you don't like me? Well, I don't like you either.

116
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,660
There. I said something.

117
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,120
You gonna order a brooke davis?

118
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,020
If only it were that easy.

119
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,300
I brought you a present.

120
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,240
It's over there, wrapped in green, and you should ask very nicely before you try and unwrap it.

121
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,640
Brooke, I-I don't know.

122
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,280
What? Are you seeing someone?

123
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:29,180
No, I -- well, I - - darling, that was rhetorical.Come on.

124
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,940
Mouth, milly. Milly, mouth.

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,510
Fall in love, get married, invite me to the wedding, and sit me next to a really hot guy.

126
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,120
Um. we met at the clothes over bro's opening, right? You're brooke's assistant.

127
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,820
Yeah -- millicent.

128
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,350
Well, that's a great job.

129
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,590
I was pretty much her assistant in high school, so.

130
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,930
Hey! You lightened your hair. It looks awesome.

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,260
Thanks. You and nathan look great, too.

132
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,840
It must be nice to have him up and walking.

133
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:03,220
Yes, really. I think I was more excited about his first steps than I was jamie's -- which is terrible.

134
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,410
So, how are you doing?

135
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,950
Are you, um, are you still upset about that peyton thing?

136
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,580
Not as upset as I am that lucas snuck off to see her the other night.

137
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,430
He did not.

138
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,300
Why?

139
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,100
I haven't asked. I'm not so sure I want to know.

140
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,270
You should ask him it's probably nothing.

141
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,940
I know. It's just.

142
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,060
suddenly, everything we do involves peyton somehow.

143
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,080
Well, that's not true.

144
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,120
Hey. I'm sorry.

145
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,920
Whenever you get a second, I need to talk to you, okay?

146
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,630
Sure.

147
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,990
Well, maybe it's a little true.

148
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,740
Huh.

149
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,470
All right.

150
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,990
That better not be yours.

151
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,780
Aw, nah, man. It ain't mine. I don't even drink shots. Please.

152
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,960
I-I'm more of A.

153
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,630
I'm not old enough.

154
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,790
Well, then whose is it?

155
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,310
Oh, that's mine.

156
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,770
Just walked away for a second.

157
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,360
Walking away -- sounds like a good idea.

158
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,090
- Lucas, right? - Yeah.

159
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,220
This is for you.

160
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,280
Why are women so screwed up?

161
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,270
Let me guess -- peyton.

162
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,160
How'd you know?

163
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,630
'Cause she sent you a drink with a check in it.

164
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,110
Yeah, we're having a tough time with the whole "friends" thing.

165
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,970
How did you two do it so easily?

166
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,300
I make everything look easy.

167
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,530
Nate.

168
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,570
Peyton and i were never in love.

169
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,630
Yeah, well, lindsey's mad at me, too.

170
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,940
And yet you seem more upset about peyton.

171
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,060
- I'm gonna go find lindsey. - All right.

172
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,970
Oh. You bought me a drink?

173
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,850
Not exactly.

174
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,160
What were you and lucas talking about?

175
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,770
Exes.

176
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,830
Girlfriends or wives?

177
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,860
So, then she comes out of the bedroom wearing a cape, and she tries to convert me to scientology.

178
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,060
And then she goes to get me a cape, and I am crawling out the window.

179
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,070
Well, at least you go on dates.

180
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,660
Guys are usually only nice to me so they can meet brooke davis.

181
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,900
Really?

182
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,050
You know brooke davis?

183
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,450
Very funny.

184
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,210
Do you need to answer that?

185
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,370
Uh, no. It's just work.

186
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,990
Thanks.

187
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,770
Kind of pathetic.

188
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,020
What is?

189
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,350
Paying people to ask for your autograph so you look famous.

190
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:51,500
Okay, I don't mean to brag, but half the people in this club are wearing my designs.

191
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,180
Well, I don't mean to brag either, but everybody in this club is drinking one of my drinks.

192
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,300
Hey, owen. Another round.

193
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,230
Looks like I'm famous, too.

194
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,090
I bet you we have sex right on this bar.

195
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,560
Oh, okay. Wait till I leave, please.

196
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,900
Look, I hate to be the one to break this to you, but your mom -- I know -- is a total bitch. I get it.

197
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,450
No. I mean, yes, but she's also. here.

198
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,480
What?

199
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,730
- mother. - Ooh.

200
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,970
What the the hell are you doing here?

201
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,980
Will you keep your voice down? I don't want the guys in here to know I'm a mother.

202
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,510
Why? You want them to think you're a prostitute?

203
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,380
I noticed you rescheduled the macy's meeting without talking to me.

204
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,470
I did.

205
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,930
Because you work for me, not the other way around.

206
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,190
Ah, yes. And you've made that crystal clear.

207
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,740
And since you seem to think you can do everything.

208
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,600
I finally have time to party.

209
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,740
You're embarrassing.

210
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:04,540
You won't listen to reason, so maybe embarrassing you out of town is the answer.

211
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,740
Do whatever you want -- not gonna affect me.

212
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,300
We'll see.

213
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,140
Hey. There you are. What do you need?

214
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,160
Oh, I just wanted to interrupt you and lindsey.

215
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,850
Told mia she was opening tonight.

216
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,240
Great. Is she excited?

217
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,150
Kinda.

218
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,540
Mia. Hey, are you okay?

219
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,720
No. I'm not okay.

220
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,900
I'm pretty far from okay right now.

221
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:46,550
I' ve never perrmedin front of a crowd before -- I mean, alone.

222
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,190
Well, I take that back.

223
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,080
I sang in my school play when I was 8, and terry adams made me cry.

224
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,650
You know, what if I choke? What if everybody laughs at me?

225
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,680
What if I'm so bad, I destroy peyton's label?

226
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,050
You realize you just made every shot, right?

227
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,320
That's amazing.

228
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,540
I always play well when I'm not thinking about it.

229
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,040
Okay, great. So when you get up onstage, don't think -- just play.

230
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,950
What if I fail?

231
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,340
Well, people fail sometimes. Look at peyton.

232
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,350
Hey!

233
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,530
Mia, you're not gonna fail. I promise.

234
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,260
Okay, so, it's just like "rock, paper, scissors, " only it's called "ninja, bear, hunter.

235
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,730
" And why do you play this, again?

236
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,890
I don't get out much.

237
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,790
Okay. On the count of three.

238
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,480
One. two. three.

239
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,690
Raaaar!

240
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,260
All right. Hunter gets bear. Okay.

241
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,320
Um. could you excuse me for a second?

242
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,890
- Sure. - I'll be right back.

243
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,650
Well, now, that looked kinky.

244
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,250
Want to try it naked?

245
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,370
What are you doing here?

246
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,030
Looking for you. Come on, let's get out of here.

247
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,430
Listen, alice, I think, um.

248
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,850
I think maybe we went a little fast.

249
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,130
I like you, and I like my job.

250
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,810
Marvin.

251
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,520
it's fine. Go have fun. Enjoy your evening.

252
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,370
- Thanks, alice. - Mm-hmm.

253
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,190
Hey.

254
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,160
I'm sorry I haven't been around. Mia's performing tonight, and she's really nervous.

255
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,560
How have you been?

256
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,880
I never realized how boring bars can be without alcohol.

257
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,580
Yeah. Tell me about it.

258
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,080
Tric needs to establish a "no mom" rule.

259
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,060
I'm a mom!

260
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,550
You don't count. You got married and pregnant before you grted high school.

261
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,150
You'll be safely locked in a home by the time you're 35.

262
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,860
Good talking to you, brooke.

263
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,620
I got to get mia backstage. I'll see you in a bit.

264
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,080
- All right. - ByE.

265
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,420
It's good talking to both of you.

266
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,900
I'm not taking this.

267
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,340
Luke, if any other tenant wanted the office, you would charge them rent.

268
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,950
Yeah, but you're not just any other tenant.

269
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,150
I am now.

270
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:18,310
Look, peyton, just - - look, if you keep talking to me, you're gonna get in trouble.

271
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,110
Something on your mind?

272
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,360
No, but my mom is on my last nerve.

273
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,880
You got anything for that?

274
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,790
Yeah -- alcohol.

275
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,040
So, what'd your mom do?

276
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,090
I'll give you one guess.

277
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,800
That's your mom?

278
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,010
No.

279
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,970
Oh, my god, it is.

280
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,210
I feel like I'm looking into the future here.

281
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,110
- It's a rough road ahead, by the way. - Okay, we're not talking anymore.

282
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,180
Owen.

283
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,740
well, looks like your future self's calling.

284
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,340
What do you like to drink in 20 years?

285
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,650
Poison.

286
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,470
I wonder if haley knows what kind of girl she hired to watch our son.

287
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,920
What kind of girl is that, exactly?

288
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,640
The kind of girl that drinks like a fish.

289
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,830
and goes skinny-dipping late at night, when everyone else is asleep.

290
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,430
Oh, my god. I-I.

291
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,510
I didn't know anyone was around.

292
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,130
I am so embarrassed.

293
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,210
Haley asked me not to wear a bikini, and then I do something even dumber.

294
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,370
I am so sorry. I completely understand if you want to fire me.

295
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,720
No. Look, no one's gonna fire you, okay?

296
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,670
You do a great job, and jamie loves you.

297
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:55,210
I'm just telling you, you need to be careful, because if haleyad caught you, this would be a very different conversation.

298
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,810
You didn't tell her?

299
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,410
No. You made a mistake, right?

300
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,640
It's not the end of the world.

301
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,750
Haley doesn't need to know everything.

302
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:13,710
No, she doesn'T.

303
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,550
Hey. I've been looking for you everywhere.

304
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,740
Well, if you keep looking next to peyton, you're never gonna find me.

305
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,680
But I guess sneaking around with her at tric is your new thing.

306
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,420
Okay, what's going on with you?

307
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,410
Why'd you sneak over here the other night?

308
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,160
I saw your car parked outside.

309
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,180
So that's why you've been so upset?

310
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,610
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

311
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,060
No, luke.

312
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,330
You should have told me.

313
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,810
I didn't sneak here.

314
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,250
I wasn't even planning on coming here.

315
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:49,290
I saw the light on, and I tried to convince my friend to be nicer to the girl that I love.

316
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,760
Right.

317
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:55,390
See, I'm still trying to figure out which is which.

318
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:59,450
Lindsey. linds.

319
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,870
I need a new office.

320
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,940
Yeah, the one you have right now is far too big and free.

321
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,220
Well, I'll settle for small and expensive. Just as long as it's not lindsey-adjacent.

322
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,950
Tell me I don't look like her when I dance.

323
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,790
Tell me I don't look like her when I dance!

324
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,950
Okay. If you tell me lindsey's a bitch.

325
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,230
Oh, my mom's a bitch. Lindsey's a bitch.

326
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,700
Is there a woman here tonight you haven't called a bitch?

327
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,030
Well, I can think of one.

328
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,850
Liy is just threatened by you.

329
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,640
Why? It's not like I'm even after lucas.

330
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,790
So you keep saying.

331
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,600
What? You don't believe me?

332
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,940
Okay. Fine. whatever

333
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:52,360
But for the record -- you look exactly like her when you dance! Bitch!

334
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,760
I do not.

335
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,740
Hey. So, um, what were we talking about before you left?

336
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,240
How cute you are.

337
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,620
Really? I-I think I would have remembered that.

338
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,380
I'm really glad brooke set us up.

339
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,340
Uh.

340
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,870
I'm sorry.

341
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,530
No.

342
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,590
I hate it when hot girls hit on me, too.

343
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,310
what's the first line of my song?

344
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,630
Didn't you write it?

345
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,050
So not the point right now.

346
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,930
Okay. Relax. You're gonna be great, mia.

347
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,280
And, honestly, what is the worst thing that could happen?

348
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,910
He just walked in.

349
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,970
Can I buy you a drink?

350
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,230
Mm. actually, my date took care of that.

351
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,270
Well, we're halfway there, then.

352
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,780
I hope you're not trying to sit on my lap.

353
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,400
I'm just looking for someone to dance with.

354
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,160
No, thanks.

355
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,380
You know where to find me.

356
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,610
I've never seen your jealous side before.

357
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,700
And you still haven'T.

358
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,400
Okay.

359
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,580
What up, nate?

360
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,800
Yo, thanks for having my back earlier in front of old man scott.

361
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,950
Quentin, how stupid are you for trying to drink in the same club as your coach?

362
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,710
Look who's talking -- you flirtin' with that hot nanny in the same club as your wife.

363
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,490
I'm not flirting with anyone.

364
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,440
Oh, okay.

365
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,580
You had my back, so I got yours, but I know flirtin' when I see it.

366
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,050
And.

367
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,770
it look like she does, too, bro.

368
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,410
okay. She's almost on. How's she doing?

369
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:48,120
Oh, I think she'll be okay as long as the only lyrics to her songs are "why is jason here?

370
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,700
" Why is jason here?

371
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,430
Because I invited him.

372
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,740
I'm sorry. You what?

373
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,090
Look, miA.

374
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,970
most people dream of the chance to stand up to the person that's kept them down.

375
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,570
This is yours.

376
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,510
Someone just tell me the first line of my song, please.

377
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:11,190
Um, it's "I never feared the unexpected.

378
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,050
Ladies and gentlemen, mia catalano.

379
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:18,050
OK, You're on.

380
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,320
Really? You invited jason?

381
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,230
Oh, hell no.

382
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,940
Um. hi.

383
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,180
You suck! Get off the ste, ho!

384
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,510
Hey. Why don't you shut the hell up?

385
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,810
Choke.

386
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,280
brooke. Will you do me a favor?

387
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:28,000
Well, if it involves drinking and flirting with the hot bartender, then yes, I can.

388
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:31,640
You like peyton and lindsey, right?

389
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,440
What kind of favor is this?

390
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,600
I was hoping maybe you could talk to them.

391
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,320
I'd love to help you, luke, but I honestly don't see the point.

392
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,970
I like lindsey, but peyton is my best friend.

393
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:51,310
And does either one of us really believe she didn't come back here for you?

394
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,140
What's that?

395
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,070
It's called a bitter shrew.

396
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,200
It's from her.

397
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,370
Hey. What happened with you and milly?

398
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,720
Uh, I just don't think it's good timing right now.

399
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,510
I've been really busy with work lately.

400
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,920
Are you feeling okay?

401
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,940
I hand-deliver a hot girl to you, and you're worried about work?

402
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,470
My mother would want to adopt you.

403
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,180
Listen, I'm having enough problems with older ladies running my life.

404
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,680
What are you talking about?

405
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:00,400
I-I've kind of been seeing my boss.

406
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,060
Define "seeing.

407
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,540
" Sleeping with.

408
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,300
Define "sleeping with.

409
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,400
" Wow.

410
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,090
Well.

411
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,750
I wish you'd told me before I got milly all worked up.

412
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,160
Oh, millicent was great.

413
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,390
I really liked her. I-I just.

414
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,440
alice is considering me for an on-air position, and those are hard to get.

415
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,970
Marvin mcfadden, did I just hear you correctly?

416
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,090
What have you become?

417
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,020
I know. I know.

418
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,240
Things have just gotten complicated lately and --

419
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:37,040
so uncomplicate them.

420
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,210
When you find the boy that I used to know.

421
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:44,860
you should have him give milly a call.

422
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:52,290
You have two choices -- you can use the number or use the napkin.

423
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,930
I'm sorry. I-I can'T.

424
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:01,510
Please welcome the honorary title!

425
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,970
thank you, jason.

426
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,690
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have been so good.

427
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,000
You think you were good?

428
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,040
The only reason people were clapping is I told them you were retarded.

429
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,270
You're just upset because the talent left your band.

430
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,970
Not as upset as I am that you left your granny panties in my bed.

431
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,850
Hey!

432
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,080
Nathan! Nathan! Hey!

433
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,830
He's not worth it, okay? Let it go!

434
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,100
Yeah, it's not worth it, nathan.

435
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,810
You're lucky.

436
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,790
Oh!

437
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,640
You ain't that lucky.

438
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,530
You're so right.

439
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,920
Tree hill is so much better than milan.

440
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,200
You are acting like an idiot.

441
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,640
And you are acting like a child.

442
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,790
The difference is, i know my behavior's ridiculous.

443
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:49,470
Since returning to this god-awful town, you've lost your way.

444
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,440
Really? Is that what you think, mom?

445
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,400
Because I feel like I have finally found it.

446
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,960
I am happy here.

447
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,440
I have friends who care about me.

448
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,900
These are not your friends.

449
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,090
Friends don't use you.

450
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,650
Neither do mothers.

451
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,480
Oh, please.

452
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,950
I've done nothing but help you.

453
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:15,440
Your little company was struggling until you came to me.

454
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:20,430
But if you think you can do it alone, just say the word.

455
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,820
You'll only lose a C.E.O.

456
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,560
and a mother.

457
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,650
Mom.

458
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,060
You're not a kid anymore.

459
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,490
So grow up.

460
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,250
when are you gonna grow up?

461
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,730
This is our first time back in a bar since your accident, and already you're in another fight.you learned nothing?

462
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:53,730
What do you expect me to do -- just sit back and watch while some jerk harasses you?

463
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:59,300
That's exactly what I expect you to do, because you're not always the guy that has to jump in and do something, 

464
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,690
and I'm not a damsel in distress.And if your last bar brawl didn't make it clear enough, you're not superman.

465
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,780
You're overreacting.

466
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,290
I didn't even hit the guy. I just walked away.

467
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,040
No. I pulled you away, and then quentin hit him.

468
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:14,880
I guess he is really learning from the best.

469
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:57,310
Hey, I'm exhausted from spending the nightavoiding you and peyton, so I think I'll catch a cab home.

470
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,270
Hey, hey. Don't be ridiculous.

471
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,240
Come on, I'll drive you.

472
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,930
It's not ridiculous, lucas. This is.

473
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,840
What are you talking about? Your hair looks great.

474
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,530
Of course you think so.

475
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,930
It's peyton blond.

476
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,340
I'm single white female.

477
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,610
No, you're not.

478
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,930
I'm not blaming you. I'm blaming me.

479
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,320
See, ever since peyton came to tree hill, I've been acting like a crazy bitch.

480
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,220
I'm neurotic, insecure, paranoid, jealous, and that is not who I am.

481
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,160
And I know that.

482
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,790
But it's who I've become.

483
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,440
I'm not stupid or blind.

484
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:29,320
I know peyton's the reason you're writing again, and I refuse to be a chapter in that book.

485
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,640
Look, lindsey. Lindsey, wait.

486
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,820
No, I've been waiting -- for you, for the book.

487
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,270
I moved here for you, remember?

488
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:39,380
So you need to figure out what you want.

489
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:44,080
I want you.

490
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:48,100
And I want you to stop being in love with peyton.

491
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:52,020
Looks like we're both screwed.

492
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,810
why are you here?

493
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:08,530
When I asked if we were dating, you laughed in my face.

494
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:11,530
Then you see me with someone else and send me a mean text?

495
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,700
That text was not mean.

496
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,030
If you kissed her, then you would have seen mean.

497
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:19,850
K bk's fascinating that you have different levels of mean, but I think I'll get off h@ one.

498
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:23,310
Haven't you learned? Yo get off when i do.

499
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,560
Well, then I hope you just did, because we're done.

500
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,620
This is over.

501
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,900
I'm sorry to hear that, marvin.

502
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,490
But if that's the way you really feel.

503
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,350
then you're fired.

504
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,690
Then I guess I'm fired.

505
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:48,490
But thank you for showing me that there are more important things in life than work.

506
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,840
You know what? Just rip up the check.

507
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,020
I'm moving offices, anyway.

508
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:11,360
Do you have an alarm in your head that goes off every time I'm happy with someone else?

509
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,180
What do you want from me?

510
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:18,280
I fly to L.A., I ask you to marry me. You said no, so I moved on.

511
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,120
Why haven't you?

512
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:26,430
'Cause I should have said yes.

513
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:30,340
Luke, I was young.

514
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,460
and I was scared.

515
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:38,330
And I did not realize that by saying I wasn't ready, it would mean that we would never be together again.

516
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:41,670
Had I known that, I would have said yes.

517
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:45,400
- Peyton. - no, luke, I miss you every day.

518
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,760
And I've told everyone here that I didn't come back for you. But I did.

519
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,170
Of course I did.

520
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,480
I still love you, lucas.

521
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,060
Peyton, I.

522
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,900
you still love me, dont you?

523
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:29,780
I have to go see lindsey.

524
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,320
obvious I came back for lucas.

525
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,800
I know.

526
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:47,720
You've had your lucas-stealing face on since you picked me up at the airport.

527
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,880
What lucas-stealing face?

528
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,650
The only face you've got.

529
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,390
Well, it doesn't even matter now. He's with lindsey.

530
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,830
Honey.

531
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,170
lindsey doesn't stand a chance. Trust me.

532
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:05,500
I have been the lindsey between lucas and peyton, and it is not a great place to be.

533
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,010
Yeah, well, neither is the place I'm at.

534
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,910
Are you kidding?

535
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,720
You're peyton sawyer.

536
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:15,110
The guy wrote a whole book about how much he loves you.

537
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,750
You think he still does?

538
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:22,540
It has always been lucas and peyton.

539
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,670
You guys are meant to be together. It's the way it's supposed to be.

540
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,950
So go and get your man.

541
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,910
And this time if he proposes, please say yes.

542
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,000
Okay?

543
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,890
Wait.

544
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,290
If i came back for lucas, then why did you come back?

545
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,650
Duh -- for lucas.

546
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,390
Game on, bitch.

547
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:57,930
Is this the sound of our demise?

548
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:06,380
Or just the opposite?

549
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:18,990
I love you and I miss you what else is there to say?

550
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,710
Good night.

551
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,140
I think she's still pissed at me.

552
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,640
She'll come around.

553
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:30,600
I mean, what girl wouldn't want her guy to stand up for her?

554
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,200
I know i would.

555
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,740
No, I mean, she's right.

556
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:34,990
I need to watch my temper.

557
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,680
All it ever does is get me in trouble.

558
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,670
Well, I'd love a guy to come to my rescue.

559
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:43,080
Does that mean I like trouble?

560
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:50,500
I'm a little drunk, so in case I said a lot of inappropriate things tonight, I want you to know.

561
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,120
I meant all of them.

562
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,360
I think I'll go for a swim.

563
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,990
I knew you were watching the other night.

564
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,100
I'm glad you were.

565
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:08,030
But you can see a lot better with the lights.

566
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,960
on.

567
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,390
Buy you a drink?

568
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,320
I better not.

569
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:59,670
I'm supposed to be an adult now, and I don't want to end up like my.

570
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,550
future self.

571
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,800
You're like, what, 22, right?

572
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,720
So, legally, this is supposed to be new to you.

573
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,380
You're acting your age.

574
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,890
It's your mother that isn'T.

575
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:16,140
Well, she just came here to embarrass me.

576
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,110
Isn't that what moms do?

577
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,850
I guess.

578
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:26,180
You don't really think I'll end up like her, do you?

579
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,260
Drunk at a bar with no friends?

580
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:30,500
Never.

581
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:33,160
You got friends.

582
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,600
Right.

583
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,300
Okay.

584
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,130
So, are you gonna ask me out now, or what?

585
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,610
Nah.

586
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,060
Too young for me.

587
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:50,200
Maybe when you grow up.

588
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,820
is this the champagne room?

589
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,020
Hales, I'm sorry, okay?

590
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,230
I tried to be responsible tonight, but that idiot got out of line.

591
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:27,200
I promise I wasn't gonna hit him.

592
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,090
Please don't be mad at me.

593
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:33,340
I'm not mad.

594
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:35,600
I'M. I'm disappointed.

595
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,410
With me?

596
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,680
In a lot of things.

597
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:45,130
I guess I should just be happy you're not sneaking around with some other girl.

598
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,430
lindsey, I-I'm sorry.

599
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:23,350
I never wanted -- lucas asked me to marry him.
