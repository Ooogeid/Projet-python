1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,574
Hi, Peyton.

2
00:00:06,867 --> 00:00:08,995
Peyton, 8th-grade cheer camp.

3
00:00:11,728 --> 00:00:13,351
Now it's hoes over psychos.

4
00:00:13,451 --> 00:00:15,374
- You saved me.
- You saved me, too.

5
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:16,720
You want to come with me?

6
00:00:16,945 --> 00:00:18,021
I'm coming with you.

7
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:21,001
Do you think it's impossible for you
to ever have feelings for me again?

8
00:00:21,038 --> 00:00:22,471
It's not impossible.

9
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:26,618
You lost your phone.

10
00:00:26,717 --> 00:00:27,570
That's not my phone.

11
00:00:27,674 --> 00:00:28,791
What are you doing here, Lucas?

12
00:00:28,823 --> 00:00:31,068
I keep feeling like Keith's
trying to tell me something.

13
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:32,309
Keith's dead.

14
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,120
Open your eyes.

15
00:00:48,775 --> 00:00:50,472
William Blake once wrote,

16
00:00:50,576 --> 00:00:52,372
"There are things
that are known

17
00:00:52,476 --> 00:00:54,202
"and things that are unknown.

18
00:00:56,195 --> 00:00:57,521
"And in between...

19
00:00:58,488 --> 00:01:00,091
- "there are doors."
- Hey, yo, Luke.

20
00:01:01,157 --> 00:01:02,991
Damn. Nice work.

21
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:05,430
No. No, it's not...

22
00:01:07,486 --> 00:01:09,623
It's the attack last week.

23
00:01:09,728 --> 00:01:11,623
Neither one of them
wants to be alone.

24
00:01:13,548 --> 00:01:16,541
Hey, if that's your story.
Look, we got to go.

25
00:01:16,646 --> 00:01:18,520
- What?
- It's Mouth. He needs our help.

26
00:01:21,585 --> 00:01:22,951
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Mayor?

27
00:01:23,058 --> 00:01:24,412
Yeah. Come on in, Joe.

28
00:01:24,945 --> 00:01:27,413
I need you to access this
phone's calling history.

29
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:29,351
Sure. Whose phone is it?

30
00:01:29,455 --> 00:01:31,091
That's what I want
you to find out.

31
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:34,522
With all due respect,
Mr. Mayor, I can't do that.

32
00:01:34,857 --> 00:01:36,092
That's illegal.

33
00:01:38,385 --> 00:01:40,932
You got a performance review coming up,
don't you, Joe?

34
00:01:41,826 --> 00:01:44,591
Not to mention a sexy little thing
going on with -- what's her name?

35
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:46,633
Darcy in public relations?

36
00:01:47,836 --> 00:01:49,010
But wait a minute.

37
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:51,040
Your wife's name's Jill,
isn't it?

38
00:01:55,126 --> 00:01:56,861
It might take me a day or two.

39
00:01:57,256 --> 00:01:58,592
Works for me.

40
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:00,110
Oh, and, Joe?

41
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,693
Say hi to Darcy for me.

42
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:10,592
So, it's been what, about a week
since Mouth skipped town with Rachel?

43
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,781
Then, all of a sudden,
I get this cryptic message.

44
00:02:12,886 --> 00:02:14,460
Sounds like he's in trouble.

45
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:17,291
Okay, what kind of message?
Like voice mail?

46
00:02:17,396 --> 00:02:19,383
No, a text, actually.
Check it out.

47
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:23,710
"Honey Grove, Texas.
Please come. Need ass"?

48
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:26,711
I was thinking he would've typed
"assistance" but his battery died.

49
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:29,133
Why didn't he just write "help"?
"Need help"?

50
00:02:29,238 --> 00:02:30,770
Maybe he need ass.

51
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:33,301
Hey.

52
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:34,922
Hey, Skills said
Mouth was in trouble.

53
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:36,231
Yeah, he sent this.

54
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:39,913
"Need ass"?

55
00:02:40,018 --> 00:02:41,621
We're thinking
it's "assistance."

56
00:02:41,748 --> 00:02:43,951
I'm gonna find
Honey Grove online.

57
00:02:47,808 --> 00:02:49,543
Hey, how are they
doing since the attack?

58
00:02:49,647 --> 00:02:51,522
Some days are better
than the others.

59
00:02:51,627 --> 00:02:53,220
But it gets the worst at night.

60
00:02:53,397 --> 00:02:55,430
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
Is Mouth okay?

61
00:02:55,535 --> 00:02:57,101
It doesn't sound like it.

62
00:02:58,827 --> 00:03:00,442
"Honey Grove, Texas.
Please come."

63
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,740
"Need ass"?

64
00:03:02,086 --> 00:03:04,580
I don't get it. He left with Rachel.
Why would he need ass?

65
00:03:04,687 --> 00:03:05,723
- Assistance.
- Assistance.

66
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:07,251
Well, if Mouth needs help,

67
00:03:07,356 --> 00:03:09,251
then one of us needs to go
down to Honey Grove, Texas.

68
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:13,003
I think we should probably all go.
It's about 90 miles from Dallas,

69
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:14,861
which is like a
20-hour car ride.

70
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:16,521
Hales, I love you for caring,

71
00:03:16,628 --> 00:03:18,250
but you're pregnant
and we got finals.

72
00:03:18,355 --> 00:03:20,581
We're all graduating soon.
It could be a last hurrah.

73
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:23,120
Hopefully, Mouth is okay and it
turns into a great road trip.

74
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:25,683
But if not,
there's safety in numbers, right?

75
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:32,453
Okay, Karen and I made sandwiches,
and I got chips and drinks,

76
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:33,560
and we're all set.

77
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:34,821
I brought red vines.

78
00:03:34,927 --> 00:03:36,993
You can't have a road
trip without red vines.

79
00:03:37,096 --> 00:03:39,441
I brought old yearbooks --
might give us a laugh.

80
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:40,543
What did you bring, Nate?

81
00:03:40,556 --> 00:03:42,163
I brought Haley,
who brought the food.

82
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:43,292
Brooke?

83
00:03:43,486 --> 00:03:46,081
I brought my hot body
and Rachel's Denali.

84
00:03:46,186 --> 00:03:48,591
She might have left,
but at least we have her car.

85
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:49,990
Sure it's not stolen?

86
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:51,970
Oh, wait.
That's just calculus exams.

87
00:03:52,076 --> 00:03:53,630
My girl's not a big Rachel fan.

88
00:03:53,736 --> 00:03:54,943
Peyton, what did you bring?

89
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:56,290
Road mix.

90
00:03:57,535 --> 00:03:59,132
Okay, let's go.

91
00:03:59,277 --> 00:04:02,952
You seem rather excited, considering
Mouth might be in a lot of trouble.

92
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:04,881
Well, I'm choosing to
believe that he's fine.

93
00:04:04,986 --> 00:04:07,911
Besides, it's Mouth. How much
trouble could he actually get into?

94
00:04:08,016 --> 00:04:09,333
He's probably having fun.

95
00:04:09,435 --> 00:04:10,640
Have fun.

99
00:05:18,596 --> 00:05:20,920
Okay, Brooke, freshman year.

100
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:24,432
Lance Bass? Really?

101
00:05:24,535 --> 00:05:26,221
He was cute, okay?

102
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,381
I'm not sure I'd go there, Hales.
Check this out.

103
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:31,812
"Luke, stay cool
forever! Haley."

104
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,661
So, what's wrong with that?

105
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,600
You think that's bad?
Check this out.

106
00:05:35,706 --> 00:05:38,400
Peyton wrote to me in my
sophomore yearbook...

107
00:05:40,135 --> 00:05:41,100
"Peyton Sawyer."

108
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,800
Come on!
I didn't even know you then.

109
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:47,890
You know how hard I worked to
get my yearbook in front of her?

110
00:05:47,996 --> 00:05:49,863
And then she signs
her damn name.

111
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:50,930
I was crushed.

112
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:52,071
Okay, how about this one?

113
00:05:52,176 --> 00:05:55,810
"Lucas, you know you want me!
Taylor James."

114
00:05:56,518 --> 00:05:58,641
I wonder what she wrote
in Nathan's yearbook.

115
00:06:00,046 --> 00:06:02,803
Hey, look.
"Luke, you're a great friend.

116
00:06:03,206 --> 00:06:06,153
"Thanks for looking out for me.
See ya around."

117
00:06:06,878 --> 00:06:08,322
Who wrote that one?

118
00:06:09,946 --> 00:06:12,151
Jimmy Edwards. Sorry.

119
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,241
How about we just try and let
go of all the pain on this trip

120
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:23,212
and only focus on the
good things in our lives?

121
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,802
Okay, who's with me?

122
00:06:24,908 --> 00:06:26,370
- Ready for that.
- Definitely.

123
00:06:26,477 --> 00:06:27,663
Okay, Luke?

124
00:06:30,546 --> 00:06:32,863
Lucas? Lucas?

125
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:34,683
Yeah, sure.

126
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:44,732
I don't know why
you do it, Conrad.

127
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:46,351
We keep playing.

128
00:06:47,557 --> 00:06:48,942
You keep losing.

129
00:06:51,697 --> 00:06:53,650
Um, hiya, fellas.

130
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:54,941
I'm Mouth.

131
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,091
Mouth, huh?

132
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:58,860
I mean, uh, Marvin. Marvin.

133
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:02,251
Listen, guys, I don't want any trouble.
I mean,

134
00:07:02,357 --> 00:07:05,242
I like girls, really. See?

135
00:07:08,866 --> 00:07:10,901
Um, if I could just
get that back --

136
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:12,583
Or what?

137
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:15,831
Listen, I know you could
probably kill me right now --

138
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:18,982
I mean...
definitely kill me right now,

139
00:07:19,088 --> 00:07:22,632
but you're only three moves away
from winning your chess match.

140
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:27,200
Knight to G7. I'm sure you were
just about to do that anyway...

141
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:29,151
Sir.

142
00:07:33,196 --> 00:07:34,333
Guard.

143
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,940
Checkmate.

144
00:07:56,704 --> 00:07:59,181
No one touches the kid.

145
00:08:09,303 --> 00:08:11,628
Skills. Hey.

146
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:13,589
Come on, man,
it's your turn to drive.

147
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:15,463
We're each taking
four-hour shifts.

148
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,620
Hey, Brooke.

149
00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:47,432
Yo, B. Davis.

150
00:08:47,646 --> 00:08:49,553
It's your turn to drive, baby.

151
00:08:52,296 --> 00:08:53,671
Already?

152
00:08:54,098 --> 00:08:55,511
Four hours.

153
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,333
So, let me get this straight.
You slept with Shelly.

154
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:02,943
The Clean Teen with
the leather pants?

155
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:04,120
Yep.

156
00:09:04,356 --> 00:09:05,831
My man!

157
00:09:07,128 --> 00:09:09,591
But then you took
Brooke to the prom --

158
00:09:09,695 --> 00:09:11,442
Brooke Davis.

159
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:15,171
Is Brooke the one with
the clothing line?

160
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:20,120
But then you left
town with Rachel

161
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,823
and all of her fine
plastic parts.

162
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,493
So, what happened, Mouth?

163
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:30,730
You guys ever had
your heart broken?

164
00:09:37,345 --> 00:09:38,760
What's going on up there?

165
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:39,932
I don't know.

166
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:42,091
How long has that light
on the dash been on?

167
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:46,502
Um, just a little while. It was kind
of a pretty color, and I liked it.

168
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,083
Bad call?

169
00:10:01,328 --> 00:10:02,582
Bad call.

170
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:07,572
I don't know.

171
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,320
It's all electronic.
I can't figure it out.

172
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:14,010
But I do know we should have
stuck to the interstate

173
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:17,530
and not taken the back roads just so Haley
could see the sandwich shaped like Elvis.

174
00:10:17,635 --> 00:10:19,192
- Hey!
- Hold on a second.

175
00:10:19,298 --> 00:10:23,351
I, too, wanted to see the sandwich shaped
like Elvis. I'm pretty sure we all did.

176
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:24,391
Thank you.

177
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:26,412
And, Lucas, admit it.

178
00:10:26,515 --> 00:10:29,441
You wanted to see the Elvis sandwich,
too, didn't you?

179
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,751
Fine. I wanted to see
the Elvis sandwich, okay?

180
00:10:32,855 --> 00:10:35,492
But that still doesn't change the fact
that we haven't seen a car pass by

181
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:36,453
since we stopped.

182
00:10:37,558 --> 00:10:39,102
Until now.

183
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,481
It's a bus.

184
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:44,130
That's a tour bus.

185
00:10:44,238 --> 00:10:45,573
Please be the Foo Fighters.

186
00:10:45,676 --> 00:10:47,281
Please be Kanye.

187
00:10:54,377 --> 00:10:56,610
Well, well.

188
00:10:56,717 --> 00:11:00,122
Stupid Elvis sandwich.

189
00:11:10,195 --> 00:11:12,892
Let's see here.
Slept with you...

190
00:11:12,996 --> 00:11:16,000
kissed you...
got slapped by you.

191
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:19,182
Just like any other night
on Chris Keller's tour bus.

192
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:22,480
So, they can tow the car to Honey Grove,
but we're on our own.

193
00:11:22,588 --> 00:11:24,201
We're rolling right
through there.

194
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,160
You guys should
just crash with me.

195
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:28,072
Come on.
It'll be like old times.

196
00:11:28,178 --> 00:11:31,743
You know, without Nate trying to kill
me for singing duets with Haley.

197
00:11:32,257 --> 00:11:35,303
I'm down for all that.
Yo, you got some gin in this joint?

198
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:36,861
Full bar in back.

199
00:11:36,967 --> 00:11:38,862
I'm loving Chris Keller.

200
00:11:40,128 --> 00:11:41,691
Look, I got plenty of room.

201
00:11:41,796 --> 00:11:44,441
I'm going your way.
Haley can sleep in my bed.

202
00:11:45,477 --> 00:11:47,922
Though you're looking
a little plump, Hales.

203
00:11:49,605 --> 00:11:52,282
What the hell?
I've had bigger trunk in my bunk.

204
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:55,110
I'm pregnant, you idiot.

205
00:11:58,605 --> 00:12:00,301
Dude, totally not mine.

206
00:12:29,268 --> 00:12:30,843
Well, everything
seems to be okay.

207
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:32,042
Are you missing anything?

208
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:34,582
I-I don't think so.

209
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:36,570
I'm sorry.

210
00:12:36,817 --> 00:12:40,151
It's just that Lucas wasn't here,
and the door was open, and I just...

211
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:43,703
I'm so embarrassed
that I called you.

212
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,601
No, no. Don't be. I would've been
upset if you didn't call me.

213
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:48,202
Now I'm gonna make
you some tea.

214
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:50,463
I want you to relax
and take it easy.

215
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:52,643
That stress isn't
healthy for the baby.

216
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:04,181
So, what's up? You been good?

217
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:07,783
Yeah, I'm all right.
Just dealing with some stuff.

218
00:13:08,376 --> 00:13:09,572
Like what?

219
00:13:09,685 --> 00:13:11,021
Nothing, really.

220
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,453
I can handle it.

221
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:15,371
Same old Nathan Scott.

222
00:13:16,717 --> 00:13:17,772
What about you?

223
00:13:17,878 --> 00:13:19,142
What's your story?

224
00:13:20,627 --> 00:13:24,061
Oh, you know,
just driving blue highways,

225
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:26,512
looking for that life
you already got.

226
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:29,972
You know, for the luckiest guy I know,
you worry too much.

227
00:13:31,468 --> 00:13:33,703
And contrary to popular belief,

228
00:13:33,806 --> 00:13:36,611
most of life's problems don't
get solved on a tour bus

229
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,291
in the middle of Texas.

230
00:13:38,976 --> 00:13:41,050
Turn your mind off and relax.

231
00:14:54,496 --> 00:14:56,871
Well, this is it --
Honey Grove,

232
00:14:56,978 --> 00:14:58,790
the sweetest town in Texas.

233
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:01,151
Get it?
'Cause of the honey part?

234
00:15:01,646 --> 00:15:03,333
Now we just got to find Mouth.

235
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:05,791
I guess I'd just ask a
cop if I were you guys.

236
00:15:05,895 --> 00:15:08,402
Right, let's just walk up to
the first cop we see and say,

237
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,293
"hey, have you seen
our friend Mouth?"

238
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:12,423
Why not? It's a small town.

239
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:14,451
- Excuse me!
- Keller.

240
00:15:16,805 --> 00:15:18,710
Top of the morning,
officer friendly.

241
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,903
Shut up. Excuse me, sir.
We're looking for a friend of ours.

242
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:23,091
Kind of goofy-looking kid,
big lips, spiky hair?

243
00:15:23,197 --> 00:15:24,490
Needs ass.

244
00:15:25,757 --> 00:15:27,200
Marvin McFadden.

245
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:29,401
Damn. Our guy's name is Mouth.

246
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:31,850
Marvin McFadden?

247
00:15:35,287 --> 00:15:37,820
Luke! Guys!
Man, am I glad to see you.

248
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:39,030
Mouth, what happened?

249
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:41,960
It's kind of a long story.
Let's just get out of here.

250
00:15:42,396 --> 00:15:43,580
Conrad.

251
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:47,262
Gino!

252
00:15:58,528 --> 00:15:59,982
Let him go, Lemmy.

253
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:22,092
Dan?

254
00:16:24,468 --> 00:16:26,602
Oh, hi.

255
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:29,323
- You spent the night?
- Yeah.

256
00:16:30,095 --> 00:16:32,210
Yeah. Just wanted to
make sure you were okay.

257
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:37,811
I'm sorry. I must look like hell.
I should go.

258
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:41,223
Or I could make us
some breakfast.

259
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:46,160
I'd like that.

260
00:16:50,745 --> 00:16:51,973
I understand.

261
00:16:52,107 --> 00:16:53,883
You have to do what
you have to do.

262
00:16:57,656 --> 00:16:58,720
Everything okay?

263
00:16:58,828 --> 00:17:00,851
Yeah. Just checking on my mom.

264
00:17:00,955 --> 00:17:02,300
Hey, we found him.

265
00:17:02,407 --> 00:17:05,151
- Hey, Mouth!
- Now I'm really emrrassed.

266
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:06,670
You guys didn't
all have to come.

267
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,863
- We wanted to, man.
- Yeah, man, definitely.

268
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:10,330
Who are you again?

269
00:17:10,526 --> 00:17:12,901
I'm the idiot who got arrested
for sleeping in the park.

270
00:17:13,005 --> 00:17:13,941
Wait. What?

271
00:17:14,046 --> 00:17:16,682
You didn't tell us what happened.
Where's Rachel?

272
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:19,640
Uh, it's kind of a long story.
She's just, um...

273
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,233
- She's gone.
- Damn it.

274
00:17:21,338 --> 00:17:23,802
Anyway, I tried texting you guys,
but my phone died.

275
00:17:23,907 --> 00:17:25,110
I just want to go home.

276
00:17:25,216 --> 00:17:28,080
Unfortunately the car won't
be ready till tomorrow.

277
00:17:28,185 --> 00:17:30,051
But there are rooms
available at a motel.

278
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:31,653
- Sorry, guys.
- No, don't be sorry.

279
00:17:31,756 --> 00:17:33,800
We wanted to come.
We're just glad you're okay.

280
00:17:33,908 --> 00:17:36,360
Besides, I'm sure we can find
something fun to do in this town.

281
00:17:36,396 --> 00:17:38,670
Yeah, right. What?
Look at this place.

282
00:17:40,657 --> 00:17:42,340
We'll go to prom.

283
00:17:42,446 --> 00:17:43,363
Prom?

284
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:46,332
Yeah, Honey Grove's prom is tonight.
We should go.

285
00:17:46,437 --> 00:17:48,470
Come on, our prom sucked.
Our car broke down.

286
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:50,351
Yeah, and we got
attacked by a psycho.

287
00:17:50,456 --> 00:17:51,691
- What?
- Long story.

288
00:17:51,795 --> 00:17:53,852
We're just gonna crash
the Honey Grove prom?

289
00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:55,323
Yeah, why not?

290
00:17:55,947 --> 00:18:00,202
Okay, hold on. Where are we gonna
get tuxes and dresses by tonight?

291
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,103
We go old-school.

292
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,320
Check it out.

293
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:06,642
I see what I'm wearing tonight.

294
00:18:06,947 --> 00:18:09,522
Dude, not if I beat you to it.
Come on!

295
00:18:14,195 --> 00:18:16,150
It's good to see you and
Peyton getting along.

296
00:18:16,258 --> 00:18:17,422
Yeah.

297
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:21,322
You know, we've been staying together
at Luke's every night since the attack.

298
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:25,173
It works out 'cause I'm basically
homeless, now that Rachel's gone, anyway.

299
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:28,640
Right. Speaking of that,
I wanted to know

300
00:18:28,748 --> 00:18:31,690
if maybe you wanted to
take the apartment back.

301
00:18:32,657 --> 00:18:34,602
Nathan and I are gonna
go stay with his mom,

302
00:18:34,706 --> 00:18:36,152
at least until the end
of the school year.

303
00:18:36,186 --> 00:18:38,443
And you still have all
your old stuff in there.

304
00:18:38,758 --> 00:18:41,853
- What do you think?
- Yes. I mean, definitely.

305
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,071
- Thank you. That's great.
- Yeah, yeah. No problem.

306
00:18:44,177 --> 00:18:46,741
I mean, also, besides,
the sooner you cut your ties

307
00:18:46,845 --> 00:18:48,832
with that lying thief Rachel,
the better, right?

308
00:18:48,935 --> 00:18:49,882
Yeah.

309
00:19:00,527 --> 00:19:02,423
Can't believe I'm going stag.

310
00:19:02,528 --> 00:19:05,720
Dude, so what happened to you,
anyway, with Rachel?

311
00:19:06,085 --> 00:19:07,633
I just wanted Shelly back.

312
00:19:07,738 --> 00:19:08,663
Shelly?

313
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:10,943
She was the girl I'd
just started dating.

314
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:14,181
Actually, we, uh,
never really got started.

315
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:15,523
She blew you off, huh?

316
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:17,280
I just felt so...

317
00:19:17,427 --> 00:19:19,302
not good enough, you know?

318
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:23,532
Like I wasn't good enough to make her
stay. I wasn't enough to amaze her.

319
00:19:24,217 --> 00:19:26,023
I just wanted to amaze her.

320
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:27,400
Bitches.

321
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:29,582
And then Rachel...

322
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:32,450
She made me feel special.

323
00:19:33,267 --> 00:19:34,872
And there's such
a power in that,

324
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:37,023
especially with a girl
who looks like Rachel.

325
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:40,772
And even though I kind
of knew we were a lie,

326
00:19:41,035 --> 00:19:43,551
it was like a pain reliever.

327
00:19:43,907 --> 00:19:46,003
I mean,
the pain was still there, but...

328
00:19:46,106 --> 00:19:47,510
I didn't feel it for a while.

329
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:48,782
So what happened?

330
00:19:48,885 --> 00:19:52,753
Well, we flew to New Orleans and we
rented a car and we just started driving.

331
00:19:52,855 --> 00:19:54,892
And Rachel was telling me
how I was good enough,

332
00:19:54,997 --> 00:19:56,640
how I was dangerous.

333
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,892
And then one night,
as this amazing sun was setting,

334
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:03,511
she called me worthy.

335
00:20:03,618 --> 00:20:06,093
Okay. Oh, fine.
Fine, Mouth, but tell me --

336
00:20:06,198 --> 00:20:07,651
what about the sex?

337
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:11,851
So we get to this hotel,
and we're in the bar.

338
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:14,410
She kind of starts
flirting with this guy.

339
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:15,942
And then she said something.

340
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,260
What did she say?

341
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:20,693
She told him he was worthy.

342
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:24,650
Hearing her say it
to someone else,

343
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:27,961
I knew that there would always
be a someone else with her,

344
00:20:28,675 --> 00:20:30,370
'cause that's who she is.

345
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:35,193
Anyway, I went for a walk,
and I ended up on the town square --

346
00:20:35,297 --> 00:20:36,920
you know,
where you guys were today?

347
00:20:37,748 --> 00:20:40,793
I started thinking about how
much I was throwing away,

348
00:20:41,037 --> 00:20:43,590
how tanking my finals
would crush my parents

349
00:20:43,697 --> 00:20:46,970
and how I'm not that guy.

350
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:51,902
I'm not dangerous.

351
00:20:55,306 --> 00:20:58,033
I'm Marvin McFadden. I'm solid.

352
00:20:58,378 --> 00:20:59,892
I'm dependable.

353
00:21:03,788 --> 00:21:04,722
That's who I am.

354
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:06,711
Tell me you at least
slept with her.

355
00:21:07,196 --> 00:21:08,992
You suck, man.

356
00:21:09,118 --> 00:21:10,221
Where is she?

357
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:12,921
I don't know. I called her
and told her I was going home,

358
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:16,093
and when I got back to the room,
she was gone.

359
00:21:17,795 --> 00:21:20,270
This picture of us was
all she left behind.

360
00:21:22,727 --> 00:21:25,292
"I could've loved the
boy in this picture."

361
00:21:25,546 --> 00:21:27,611
I hate you, Mouth.
You know that?

362
00:21:27,717 --> 00:21:30,981
You sure you didn't sleep with
her before your lame-ass epiphany?

363
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:32,210
No.

364
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:35,881
But I did see her naked.

365
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:38,362
You really suck, man.
You know that?

366
00:21:57,367 --> 00:22:00,571
Anybody ever tell you that you're
kind of pretty, Haley James Scott?

367
00:22:00,718 --> 00:22:02,473
Does Chris Keller count?

368
00:22:05,427 --> 00:22:08,103
You know what's great about being
a married couple going to a prom?

369
00:22:08,145 --> 00:22:08,783
What?

370
00:22:08,885 --> 00:22:11,171
You get to use the hotel
room before the dance.

371
00:22:25,456 --> 00:22:27,041
Penny for your thoughts?

372
00:22:27,366 --> 00:22:29,642
I'm not sure they're
worth that much.

373
00:22:30,008 --> 00:22:31,943
Just thinking about Chase.

374
00:22:32,326 --> 00:22:34,083
I'm really sorry, Brooke.

375
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:36,100
You miss him?

376
00:22:37,137 --> 00:22:38,581
Yeah, I do.

377
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:42,033
Plus, I'm not really a fan
of being alone these days.

378
00:22:42,238 --> 00:22:45,972
Oh, well, I was thinking maybe
you could move in with me.

379
00:22:46,977 --> 00:22:50,381
I can't.
I'm moving back into the apartment.

380
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:53,222
Okay, cool.

381
00:22:53,327 --> 00:22:54,732
I just -- yeah.

382
00:22:54,838 --> 00:22:57,692
But maybe you
could move in, too?

383
00:22:58,448 --> 00:22:59,930
You mean that?

384
00:23:01,586 --> 00:23:02,803
Yeah.

385
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:05,813
Look...

386
00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:10,790
I know I said we could never
be friends like before.

387
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:15,413
But...

388
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:18,182
maybe we can be better.

389
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:24,823
You look beautiful.

390
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,883
Hey, Skills,
you know this girl?

391
00:23:45,677 --> 00:23:46,723
Yeah.

392
00:23:47,065 --> 00:23:48,030
That's Abby.

393
00:23:48,137 --> 00:23:49,780
She was in the tutor center.

394
00:23:50,325 --> 00:23:51,490
You know.

395
00:23:54,198 --> 00:23:56,183
You know,
it just never made no sense to me.

396
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:57,512
What's that?

397
00:23:58,528 --> 00:24:03,451
Jimmy. See, Abby had diabetes,
so he let her go.

398
00:24:05,838 --> 00:24:09,083
Look, I know Jimmy was all
distraught and not hisself, but...

399
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:14,533
I could never understand how he could
just have it in his heart to let Abby go,

400
00:24:14,657 --> 00:24:18,423
but with Keith,
that was somebody he knew and loved.

401
00:24:22,638 --> 00:24:23,660
Luke.

402
00:24:30,505 --> 00:24:32,913
Lucas Scott,
will you go to prom with me?

403
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:34,573
Absolutely.

404
00:24:53,895 --> 00:24:56,121
Nice outfits.

405
00:24:56,607 --> 00:24:58,033
You guys crashing?

406
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:00,212
Who, us? No.

407
00:25:00,317 --> 00:25:02,050
Honey Grove's a small town.

408
00:25:02,505 --> 00:25:04,343
We know everybody
in our school.

409
00:25:05,177 --> 00:25:06,881
Okay, look. Here's the deal.

410
00:25:06,987 --> 00:25:09,321
We got stranded here,
and our prom really sucked,

411
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,462
so we figured maybe we
could come to yours.

412
00:25:11,566 --> 00:25:13,080
You won't tell anyone,
will you?

413
00:25:13,188 --> 00:25:14,871
No, it's cool.

414
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:16,850
You guys have fun.

415
00:25:20,157 --> 00:25:21,942
Anybody want to dance?

416
00:26:08,005 --> 00:26:10,292
So nobody has a
fatal heart condition

417
00:26:10,397 --> 00:26:13,451
and a father who was
purposely set on fire?

418
00:26:14,837 --> 00:26:17,130
You probably have classmates
who are married, right?

419
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:21,201
Wife's pregnant?
Got married as juniors?

420
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:25,370
I started the clothing line after
Peyton and I shoplifted my designs back

421
00:26:25,475 --> 00:26:26,572
and got arrested.

422
00:26:26,676 --> 00:26:28,900
Arrested? What did
your parents say?

423
00:26:29,007 --> 00:26:31,451
Oh, I haven't seen my
parents in like a year.

424
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:33,452
I live with my friend Rachel.
She's so funny.

425
00:26:33,557 --> 00:26:36,423
She's had all this plastic surgery,
and she just got suspended, and...

426
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:38,673
Now she's kind of missing.

427
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,232
You ever had your heart broken?

428
00:26:41,336 --> 00:26:43,493
Yeah, I think that
happens everywhere.

429
00:26:54,577 --> 00:26:57,042
You know, I really appreciate
the way you've been lately

430
00:26:57,147 --> 00:26:58,831
since my pregnancy.

431
00:27:00,236 --> 00:27:01,302
But?

432
00:27:02,535 --> 00:27:06,100
Well, you can't blame
me for being cautious.

433
00:27:06,497 --> 00:27:09,633
17 years of misery
is a long time.

434
00:27:09,847 --> 00:27:11,181
Why now?

435
00:27:12,395 --> 00:27:14,203
I was lying to myself, Karen.

436
00:27:14,726 --> 00:27:16,283
I was also married.

437
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,641
I'm single now,
for the first time since I was 17,

438
00:27:19,747 --> 00:27:21,081
and truly in love.

439
00:27:24,657 --> 00:27:26,482
You're still in
my heart, Karen.

440
00:27:28,228 --> 00:27:29,733
That's why now.

441
00:27:43,946 --> 00:27:45,043
What?

442
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,620
We've just been
through so much.

443
00:27:48,726 --> 00:27:50,572
You've been through so much.

444
00:27:50,697 --> 00:27:53,503
Sometimes I wonder how
you put up with me.

445
00:27:55,998 --> 00:27:57,933
I gave you my heart.

446
00:27:58,098 --> 00:28:00,991
When you fall short --
when we fall short...

447
00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:05,830
...I know we're gonna be okay.

448
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,511
You're my forever.
You're my always.

449
00:28:12,695 --> 00:28:15,090
God, the way you look
at me sometimes.

450
00:28:19,147 --> 00:28:21,782
Thanks for being so good
to me this week, Luke...

451
00:28:21,887 --> 00:28:23,061
and to Brooke.

452
00:28:23,165 --> 00:28:24,683
It means everything.

453
00:28:24,896 --> 00:28:26,750
I'd do anything for you.

454
00:28:30,385 --> 00:28:32,500
Uh, could you get a room?

455
00:28:35,578 --> 00:28:37,133
Do you want to?

456
00:28:50,565 --> 00:28:53,270
I'd avoid the punch.
It's more vodka than punch.

457
00:28:53,378 --> 00:28:55,533
Great. Thank you for the tip.

458
00:28:56,017 --> 00:28:57,913
- You having fun, tutor girl?
- Yeah, I am.

459
00:28:58,016 --> 00:29:01,542
Although I think you mean ex-tutor girl,
thanks to that hag Rachel.

460
00:29:03,268 --> 00:29:04,922
Haley, it was me.

461
00:29:05,865 --> 00:29:07,302
What was?

462
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:09,710
I stole the test. I cheated.

463
00:29:09,816 --> 00:29:11,381
Rachel just took
the fall for me.

464
00:29:11,487 --> 00:29:12,820
Are you kidding me?

465
00:29:12,927 --> 00:29:15,801
Brooke, I got fired for that. Not to
mention the fact that I trusted you

466
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:17,250
and you lied to my face.

467
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,331
I know, and I'm sorry.
It's just...

468
00:29:19,436 --> 00:29:22,273
I wasn't gonna graduate, and then she
told me I'd lose my clothing contract,

469
00:29:22,306 --> 00:29:23,941
- and I panicked and --
- Unbelievable.

470
00:29:24,048 --> 00:29:25,672
Haley, wait. Don't go.
I feel terrible.

471
00:29:25,775 --> 00:29:27,243
I'm sure you do.

472
00:29:28,848 --> 00:29:29,841
You know what?

473
00:29:29,948 --> 00:29:31,872
That tape with you and
Nathan really hurt me,

474
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:35,031
but I decided to let it go because
that was a Brooke I didn't know.

475
00:29:36,595 --> 00:29:37,992
This is worse.

476
00:29:38,097 --> 00:29:39,612
My friend did this.

477
00:29:49,818 --> 00:29:51,351
You girls want to dance?

478
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:52,781
No, thanks.

479
00:29:53,997 --> 00:29:56,600
Wait. You're Chris
Keller, right?

480
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:57,981
That's right.

481
00:30:00,286 --> 00:30:02,031
How old are you?

482
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:12,480
I had a great evening, Karen.

483
00:30:12,587 --> 00:30:14,573
Thanks. I can see myself out.

484
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:17,611
Well, maybe we
could do this again.

485
00:30:18,486 --> 00:30:19,762
Soon.

486
00:30:21,178 --> 00:30:22,423
Sure.

487
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:26,110
But just friends, right?

488
00:30:27,137 --> 00:30:28,510
We'll see.

489
00:30:49,857 --> 00:30:51,283
You've got protection, right?

490
00:30:51,387 --> 00:30:52,783
Have you met my father?

491
00:30:52,887 --> 00:30:54,443
Of course you do. Sorry.

492
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:56,713
Luke.

493
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,761
I'm really glad we waited.

494
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:02,862
Last year would have been just sex,
and now I...

495
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:05,821
I am so in love with you.

496
00:31:06,815 --> 00:31:08,703
I love you, too, Peyton.

497
00:31:17,886 --> 00:31:19,570
So, B. Davis,
you have fun tonight?

498
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,103
Oh, I have a good time.

499
00:31:21,206 --> 00:31:22,672
You seem a little drunk.

500
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,363
I said I have a good time.

501
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,431
- After-hours in my room?
- Yeah.

502
00:31:29,865 --> 00:31:31,380
Damn, I got to stop doing this.

503
00:31:31,488 --> 00:31:34,242
Oh, god. I'm so sorry, really.

504
00:31:37,508 --> 00:31:39,202
That was uncomfortable.

505
00:31:39,448 --> 00:31:40,880
You know what, guys?

506
00:31:41,448 --> 00:31:42,972
I think I'm gonna take a walk.

507
00:31:43,077 --> 00:31:44,803
You sure? You been drinking.

508
00:31:45,066 --> 00:31:47,151
Trust me, I'm sober now.

509
00:32:00,957 --> 00:32:02,320
How's my girl feeling?

510
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:04,920
Okay.

511
00:32:05,768 --> 00:32:07,242
Is your leg bothering you?

512
00:32:07,345 --> 00:32:09,380
No, my leg is not bothering me.

513
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:11,210
It's Brooke that's
bothering me.

514
00:32:11,317 --> 00:32:14,181
I'm trying to let it all go and
just be here with you, but...

515
00:32:15,128 --> 00:32:16,801
Anything I can help with?

516
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:20,290
No. Not really.

517
00:32:26,808 --> 00:32:28,540
Tell me a secret.

518
00:32:29,358 --> 00:32:30,461
Risky.

519
00:32:31,308 --> 00:32:32,381
Okay.

520
00:32:34,728 --> 00:32:38,762
For the past few months, I've been
pretty freaked out about being a dad.

521
00:32:39,467 --> 00:32:43,250
But lately, I, uh,
I know it's gonna be okay.

522
00:32:43,535 --> 00:32:45,531
It's gonna be great, actually.

523
00:32:47,935 --> 00:32:51,250
You are so sexy when
you talk like that.

524
00:32:54,327 --> 00:32:56,520
I'm so glad we made this trip.

525
00:32:57,186 --> 00:32:59,273
I'm always gonna remember this.

526
00:32:59,538 --> 00:33:01,293
- Honey Grove?
- No.

527
00:33:02,207 --> 00:33:04,422
How much I love you right now.

528
00:33:19,187 --> 00:33:21,600
Well, well.

529
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:23,583
Took you long enough.

530
00:33:23,688 --> 00:33:25,431
Don't flatter yourself.

531
00:33:25,707 --> 00:33:27,133
Want to come inside?

532
00:33:27,235 --> 00:33:29,833
I get really good-looking
after a few drinks.

533
00:33:29,937 --> 00:33:32,161
Oh, but I've already
had a few drinks.

534
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:34,183
And how do I look?

535
00:33:34,285 --> 00:33:36,791
As good as the last
time I got you wasted?

536
00:33:37,068 --> 00:33:38,293
Listen.

537
00:33:39,165 --> 00:33:42,521
My last couple relationships
have been screwed up big-time.

538
00:33:42,626 --> 00:33:45,902
And I also have a terrible
fear of being alone.

539
00:33:46,746 --> 00:33:48,742
So if we slept together,

540
00:33:48,848 --> 00:33:51,703
it would just mean that I'm drunk
and trying to kill the pain.

541
00:33:51,806 --> 00:33:55,551
It wouldn't have
anything to do with you.

542
00:33:58,488 --> 00:34:00,023
Works for me.

543
00:34:00,656 --> 00:34:01,733
No.

544
00:34:05,596 --> 00:34:06,810
No.

545
00:34:08,778 --> 00:34:10,921
I got to stop all that.

546
00:34:12,048 --> 00:34:14,162
I'm graduating soon.

547
00:34:14,577 --> 00:34:17,350
And god forbid
I end up like you.

548
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:22,082
So you just want to talk?

549
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,803
You just want to talk?

550
00:34:25,758 --> 00:34:27,013
Sure.

551
00:34:27,396 --> 00:34:30,151
Chris Keller gets lonely,
too, sometimes.

552
00:34:32,467 --> 00:34:34,103
I heard that.

553
00:34:39,596 --> 00:34:40,972
Tell me something.

554
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,780
I can't believe you guys
came all this way to get me.

555
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,433
You're our boy, dog.

556
00:34:51,876 --> 00:34:54,853
You know how I've been complaining
about being everyone's friend?

557
00:34:55,107 --> 00:34:56,310
No more.

558
00:34:56,548 --> 00:34:58,110
I'm lucky to be that guy.

559
00:34:58,216 --> 00:35:01,893
And I have a lot of great things because of
it and a lot of great friends because of it.

560
00:35:01,996 --> 00:35:03,330
See, there you go.

561
00:35:03,546 --> 00:35:06,182
I call this a good road trip.

562
00:35:06,288 --> 00:35:07,412
Yeah.

563
00:35:08,795 --> 00:35:10,702
So, graduation soon, huh?

564
00:35:10,805 --> 00:35:12,721
It's a little intimidating.
I mean,

565
00:35:12,826 --> 00:35:16,640
I only spent a few days in the real world,
and I got to say, it was kind of scary.

566
00:35:16,745 --> 00:35:18,280
You'll be a'ight, dog.

567
00:35:18,388 --> 00:35:19,840
I mean, we all gonna be.

568
00:35:19,947 --> 00:35:21,442
And if you ain't,

569
00:35:21,585 --> 00:35:23,873
your good friends gonna
get you through it, right?

570
00:35:24,216 --> 00:35:25,162
Yeah.

571
00:35:25,705 --> 00:35:27,010
My dog.

572
00:35:42,337 --> 00:35:43,521
Hey, you.

573
00:35:44,968 --> 00:35:46,160
You okay?

574
00:35:47,176 --> 00:35:48,973
Wow. You look beautiful.

575
00:35:52,286 --> 00:35:53,423
You seem sad.

576
00:35:54,956 --> 00:35:56,803
No. I'm not.

577
00:35:58,236 --> 00:35:59,482
It's just...

578
00:36:03,185 --> 00:36:05,391
...I really love you, Lucas.

579
00:36:05,725 --> 00:36:07,401
And it's a big deal.

580
00:36:13,307 --> 00:36:15,022
I love you, too, Peyton.

581
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:17,650
I promise.

582
00:36:20,148 --> 00:36:22,112
I need to go see Brooke.

583
00:36:22,487 --> 00:36:25,013
It's our first night
apart since the attack.

584
00:36:29,456 --> 00:36:30,511
Hey.

585
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:34,650
I'm sorry about last night.

586
00:36:35,548 --> 00:36:36,763
It's okay.

587
00:36:37,135 --> 00:36:38,970
Life's too short, you know?

588
00:36:40,726 --> 00:36:43,472
So, does the roommate
offer still stand?

589
00:36:44,008 --> 00:36:45,221
Yeah.

590
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:48,661
If we're gonna live together,
we need to come up with a system,

591
00:36:48,765 --> 00:36:50,722
'cause I don't want
to see that again.

592
00:36:50,826 --> 00:36:51,983
Yeah.

593
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,050
Did someone say threesome?

594
00:36:55,158 --> 00:36:57,623
'Cause I'm a little sore,
but I could be real up for that.

595
00:36:57,726 --> 00:36:58,620
Sore from what?

596
00:36:58,726 --> 00:37:01,793
Staying up all night,
talking about your feelings and crying?

597
00:37:02,028 --> 00:37:03,942
You said you
weren't gonna tell.

598
00:37:18,805 --> 00:37:20,502
Haley, can I talk to you?

599
00:37:28,028 --> 00:37:29,980
I'm gonna tell
Turner the truth.

600
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,702
Don't.

601
00:37:34,867 --> 00:37:36,890
So I lost my job at
the tutoring center.

602
00:37:36,996 --> 00:37:40,371
It's not as important as you not
graduating or losing your clothing contract.

603
00:37:40,476 --> 00:37:44,753
Thank you, but none of that
is as important to me as us.

604
00:37:45,456 --> 00:37:48,071
I mean,
maybe my clothing contract but...

605
00:37:48,177 --> 00:37:51,071
No, seriously, none of it.

606
00:37:51,178 --> 00:37:54,192
I'm just so sorry that I
didn't tell you, Haley.

607
00:37:54,685 --> 00:37:56,532
Can you forgive me?

608
00:37:58,515 --> 00:38:00,723
You are on notice,
Brooke Davis.

609
00:38:00,827 --> 00:38:02,402
Clean up your act

610
00:38:02,505 --> 00:38:04,180
and be the girl I love.

611
00:38:09,015 --> 00:38:13,153
Well, Chris Keller's
work here is done.

612
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:20,831
Okay.

613
00:38:21,636 --> 00:38:22,912
I'm leaving.

614
00:38:25,295 --> 00:38:26,492
Okay.

615
00:38:36,718 --> 00:38:38,580
I think I'm gonna
miss Honey Grove.

616
00:38:52,057 --> 00:38:53,491
Yeah. Me too.

617
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:00,723
So, what do you want to hear,
P. Sawyer?

618
00:39:01,187 --> 00:39:02,990
I'm feeling the road mix.

619
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:20,490
Hey.

620
00:40:20,598 --> 00:40:21,810
I need to talk to you.

621
00:40:21,918 --> 00:40:23,072
Yeah. What's up?

622
00:40:24,606 --> 00:40:27,103
I've been getting calls from
this federal investigator.

623
00:40:27,207 --> 00:40:29,800
He's asking questions
about point-shaving, Luke.

624
00:40:30,216 --> 00:40:32,391
Yeah, but we won the
state championship.

625
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:35,261
Not state. Semifinals.

626
00:40:37,865 --> 00:40:39,322
What are you gonna do?

627
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:42,523
They're not asking
about me, Luke.

628
00:40:43,016 --> 00:40:44,731
They're asking about you.

629
00:40:52,428 --> 00:40:54,482
Mr. Mayor,
the phone was prepaid.

630
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:55,933
The only calls
were made to you.

631
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,550
After the school shooting,
we fingerprinted all the students.

632
00:40:58,658 --> 00:41:00,062
I found a match.

633
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:06,701
William blake once wrote,

634
00:41:06,807 --> 00:41:08,402
"There are thing that are known

635
00:41:08,505 --> 00:41:10,460
"and things that are unknown.

636
00:41:10,716 --> 00:41:12,390
"And in between...

637
00:41:13,016 --> 00:41:14,571
"there are doors."
