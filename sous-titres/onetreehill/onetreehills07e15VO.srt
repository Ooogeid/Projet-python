1
00:00:13,453 --> 00:00:17,540
"The girl behind the brown door."

2
00:00:17,623 --> 00:00:21,344
Doesn't have the same ring to it.

3
00:00:21,427 --> 00:00:22,745
Hey, brooke.
How you doing?

4
00:00:22,828 --> 00:00:26,081
Yeah, I'm just watching
a teamster paint my adolescence

5
00:00:26,164 --> 00:00:27,682
A fugly shade of brown.

6
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:30,754
Oh. I guess there's a lot
of memories around here for you.

7
00:00:30,837 --> 00:00:32,372
You could say that.

8
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:35,390
In high school,
this was lucas' bedroom.

9
00:00:36,688 --> 00:00:39,989
Mm. Now that
<i>that's</i> burned into my brain,

10
00:00:40,072 --> 00:00:43,258
How we, uh, doing on the
wardrobe choices for scene 23?

11
00:00:43,341 --> 00:00:44,833
The big love scene --

12
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,837
Slinky off-the-shoulder,
tight-and-revealing.

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,552
Nice. I knew hiring you as costume
designer was the right move.

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,449
Thank you.

15
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,209
Let me see them on her
before I make a decision.

16
00:00:56,044 --> 00:00:57,224
So...

17
00:00:57,422 --> 00:00:59,323
Speaking of high school memories,

18
00:00:59,406 --> 00:01:01,788
Haley and quinn organized
that fundraiser dance

19
00:01:01,871 --> 00:01:03,299
At tree hill high tonight.

20
00:01:03,382 --> 00:01:04,885
And I just wanted to tell you

21
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:07,137
In case you were thinking
it'd be weird to go.

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,457
Not that you would.
But if you did...

23
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,611
It wouldn't.

24
00:01:10,694 --> 00:01:13,152
Uh, thanks, but, you know,
we shoot our first scenes tomorrow,

25
00:01:13,235 --> 00:01:14,907
And I got a million things to do.

26
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,990
Besides, you know what a geek
I was in high school.

27
00:01:17,073 --> 00:01:18,431
You've seen my yearbook photo.

28
00:01:18,514 --> 00:01:20,713
Yeah, that's burned into <i>my</i> brain.

29
00:01:20,796 --> 00:01:21,961
Exactly.

30
00:01:22,044 --> 00:01:24,948
The day I graduated,
I swore I'd never go back.

31
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:27,430
You have fun, though.
I'll see you tomorrow.

32
00:01:27,513 --> 00:01:30,665
See you tomorrow.

33
00:01:43,477 --> 00:01:46,778
Clay, I'm here for my morning laps.

34
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:51,866
I even shaved certain...
Areas to cut down on my time.

35
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,915
And yours.

36
00:01:53,998 --> 00:01:57,501
Ugh.
Just go away already.

37
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,344
Ugh. Don't tell me you're in there

38
00:01:59,427 --> 00:02:02,474
With that miserable slag again.

39
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:28,986
Sorry.
I'm such a slag.

40
00:02:39,455 --> 00:02:40,511
Guys?

41
00:02:40,747 --> 00:02:42,745
It's a little early
to be surfing for porn.

42
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:44,151
Don't ever say that.

43
00:02:44,234 --> 00:02:45,668
Don't even <i>think</i> it.

44
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:47,816
We're not looking at porn...
Yet.

45
00:02:48,027 --> 00:02:49,443
We're changing your life.

46
00:02:49,526 --> 00:02:52,164
"Cantwaittofindadate.Com"

47
00:02:53,095 --> 00:02:54,202
Seriously?

48
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:56,050
Listen, the best way
to get over millie

49
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:57,677
Is to get right back on the horse...

50
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,520
Preferably a hot, naked,
made-to-order horse.

51
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:03,411
And all you have to do
is describe your perfect woman.

52
00:03:18,089 --> 00:03:19,979
Hey, man.

53
00:03:20,062 --> 00:03:21,082
Morning.

54
00:03:21,165 --> 00:03:22,621
Morning?

55
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:23,991
Where the hell are we?

56
00:03:24,074 --> 00:03:26,399
We left that charity event
in atlanta early

57
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:28,572
So we could make it back
to tree hill by morning.

58
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:30,611
Yeah. Uh, right after
you fell asleep last night,

59
00:03:30,694 --> 00:03:31,847
It started raining.

60
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,956
Yeah?

61
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,758
Really hard.
And?

62
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:36,757
One might even call it a deluge.

63
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,050
Clay.

64
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:41,405
I missed the highway exit

65
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:44,640
And, uh, drove a few hours
in the wrong direction.

66
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:46,141
But the good news is

67
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,561
That we're only a couple hundred
miles outside of tree hill,

68
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:50,434
And we're driving a corvette.

69
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:52,789
We'll be home faster
than you can say yao ming.

70
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:04,251
Yao ming.

71
00:04:12,072 --> 00:04:13,761
So we'll get home this afternoon.

72
00:04:13,844 --> 00:04:15,164
Clay...

73
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:17,737
There was a reason
I had to be home this morning.

74
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,776
Haley: Here I come.

75
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,862
Hope you guys are ready for me.

76
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:29,851
Bacon, crispy.

77
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:31,667
Eggs, scrambled.
Milk, chocolate.

78
00:04:33,715 --> 00:04:35,947
Besides "please" and "thank you,"
do you have anything else

79
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,489
You would like to say
to your mother?

80
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:41,090
Pancakes, blueberry?

81
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:49,199
I can't believe it.

82
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:51,551
They frickin' forgot my birthday.

83
00:04:55,986 --> 00:04:58,086
Haley, listen,
my phone is bad to die.

84
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:00,233
Everything's fine... we're just
having some car trouble,

85
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:02,264
So I don't know
when we're gonna make it home.

86
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:03,497
But, haley...

87
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:06,430
Happy birthday.

88
00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:07,713
Well...

89
00:05:09,282 --> 00:05:10,968
According to gomer pyle,

90
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:13,538
"they don't got no fancy car tires,"

91
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:16,174
So they got to tow it
to mount pilot.

92
00:05:16,257 --> 00:05:18,109
They'll have it back by tonight.

93
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,411
Tonight?
Come o--

94
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:22,544
I got to get ahold of haley.

95
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:25,459
I always go big for her birthday.
She'll be expecting something.

96
00:05:26,552 --> 00:05:28,502
Let me use your phone.
Sure.

97
00:05:29,504 --> 00:05:31,805
It's in the car.

98
00:05:39,946 --> 00:05:42,597
Hey, alex, I just got
the gold script revisions,

99
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,332
But I don't see any changes.

100
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:46,053
That's 'cause there aren't any.

101
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,661
Then why'd we put out pages?

102
00:05:47,744 --> 00:05:49,796
I wasn't gonna let the final
script color be salmon.

103
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,879
Puke.

104
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:53,532
Okay.

105
00:05:53,615 --> 00:05:56,601
Hey, so I, um, I saw you
talking to brooke earlier.

106
00:05:56,684 --> 00:05:58,802
She practically begged you
to go to that dance.

107
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:00,270
Not quite.

108
00:06:00,353 --> 00:06:02,672
I think what she said was "it
wouldn't be weird" if I went.

109
00:06:02,755 --> 00:06:06,174
Trust me.
She wants you to go.

110
00:06:06,257 --> 00:06:08,309
I think she was just being polite.

111
00:06:08,392 --> 00:06:11,445
It's -- it's been weird
between us since the breakup.

112
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:13,781
And since when are you
so pro brooke-and-julian?

113
00:06:13,864 --> 00:06:15,649
Oh, I'm a total "brulian" fan now.

114
00:06:15,732 --> 00:06:17,084
One of the steps of recovery

115
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,552
Is to make amends
for all the wrongs you've done.

116
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:21,721
You still gonna have time
to be in the movie?

117
00:06:21,804 --> 00:06:23,805
Shut up!

118
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,362
Why are we eating
with the nice plates?

119
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:32,130
We only do that
on holidays and stuff.

120
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:33,265
I don't know.

121
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:35,666
Maybe it's the birth of a new day.

122
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:37,234
Are you feeling all right?

123
00:06:37,317 --> 00:06:38,503
Yeah.

124
00:06:38,586 --> 00:06:40,638
Listen, quinn and I
have to leave early

125
00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:42,106
To set up for this dance,

126
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:45,342
So junk and fergie are gonna
come over to babysit, okay?

127
00:06:45,425 --> 00:06:47,411
You only get those guys
when you can't find anyone else.

128
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:48,712
That's not true.

129
00:06:48,795 --> 00:06:50,447
You have fun with junk and fergie.

130
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,615
Besides, the two of them
equals one responsible adult.

131
00:06:52,698 --> 00:06:54,150
I'm not a baby anymore.

132
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:56,919
I'm old enough
to stay home by myself.

133
00:06:57,002 --> 00:06:59,587
And I'm old enough to get
arrested for child endangerment,

134
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,522
Which would be my third strike,
by the way.

135
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:02,872
Fourth.

136
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,894
Morning, jamie!

137
00:07:06,977 --> 00:07:08,562
Hey, little sis!

138
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:10,063
It's the big day!

139
00:07:10,146 --> 00:07:11,898
Oh, it's no big deal.

140
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:13,433
Of course it is.

141
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,067
Today's the day we rescue
the endangered arts program

142
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,335
At tree hill high.

143
00:07:16,418 --> 00:07:18,103
What could be bigger than that?

144
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:19,571
I can't think of a thing.

145
00:07:19,654 --> 00:07:21,706
Since the theme of the dance
is "return to the '80s,"

146
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:24,041
I get to fulfill
my lifelong dream --

147
00:07:24,124 --> 00:07:25,509
I'm crimping my hair.

148
00:07:25,592 --> 00:07:26,945
While that is very '80s,

149
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:28,880
You may need to rethink
your life goals.

150
00:07:30,164 --> 00:07:31,915
Listen, um, we might be
flying solo tonight.

151
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:33,517
I got a message from nathan
and clay.

152
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,606
It seems like they're having
some car trouble.

153
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,653
Really? How much you want to bet
that's a ploy

154
00:07:37,736 --> 00:07:39,770
To get out
of wearing parachute pants?

155
00:07:40,605 --> 00:07:42,724
I'm gonna go crimp my hair.

156
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:44,107
Yay.

157
00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:49,864
Yeesh.

158
00:07:49,947 --> 00:07:53,500
I'd like my margarita blended,
no salt.

159
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,934
Ha ha.

160
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:57,235
I'm thinking about wearing this
to the '80s dance

161
00:07:57,318 --> 00:07:58,636
At my high school tonight.

162
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,034
What a coincidence,

163
00:08:00,117 --> 00:08:02,447
'cause I actually learned
everything I know about fashion

164
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,149
From "miami vice" reruns.

165
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,111
You were born
in the wrong decade, my friend.

166
00:08:07,194 --> 00:08:08,511
Yeah, perhaps.

167
00:08:08,594 --> 00:08:10,948
But I do make the perfect date
for an '80s dance.

168
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:13,081
Yeah.

169
00:08:13,164 --> 00:08:15,549
And by "date,"

170
00:08:15,632 --> 00:08:18,485
I just mean a guy who wants
to go strictly as friends.

171
00:08:18,568 --> 00:08:19,753
Yeah, I...

172
00:08:19,836 --> 00:08:21,754
I'm just not sure
that's really a good idea.

173
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:22,921
Come on.

174
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:24,756
The best way
for me to meet a hot girl

175
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,725
Is to have another one on my arm.

176
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,001
It's like a magnet.

177
00:08:30,914 --> 00:08:32,645
You'd be doing me a favor.

178
00:08:34,956 --> 00:08:35,966
Okay.

179
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,568
We will go as friends.

180
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,536
Okay, cool.
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

181
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:43,972
Oh, and by the way, for
the whole magnet thing to work,

182
00:08:44,055 --> 00:08:46,107
I'm gonna need you
to salvage that train wreck.

183
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,284
Yeah.

184
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,418
Quinny, are you up there?

185
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,920
She's pimping her hair.

186
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,588
I hope you mean "crimping."

187
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,123
Listen, I have to go
run some errands, okay?

188
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:12,325
Please remind quinn to stay
until junk and fergie get here.

189
00:09:12,408 --> 00:09:13,259
Sure.

190
00:09:13,342 --> 00:09:14,526
Okay. Mwah.

191
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:17,660
Love you, baby.
Have fun tonight.

192
00:09:17,743 --> 00:09:19,477
I will.

193
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,965
Hey. Was your mom
looking for me? Yeah.

194
00:09:25,048 --> 00:09:26,199
She wanted me to tell you

195
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:28,000
That she's gonna pick up
junk and fergie,

196
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,194
And you can leave whenever.

197
00:09:30,756 --> 00:09:32,118
Okay.

198
00:09:37,758 --> 00:09:39,376
Okay, little bro.

199
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:41,145
No hard feelings.

200
00:09:41,228 --> 00:09:43,648
Believe that?
Jamie just cancelled on us.

201
00:09:43,731 --> 00:09:45,818
He said they went another direction.

202
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:48,191
That's cold, man.
Yeah.

203
00:09:48,609 --> 00:09:49,789
Where were we?

204
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,215
Let's see.

205
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:52,968
Must be a local girl.

206
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,512
Hair color, blonde.
Eyes, blue.

207
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,104
- Rockin' bod. 
- Oh, come on. Don't be shallow.

208
00:09:58,187 --> 00:10:00,287
Give her an I.Q.
Of at least 100

209
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:02,205
And a good sense of humor.

210
00:10:02,288 --> 00:10:03,602
That should be everything.

211
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,310
Come on, where's our perfect woman?

212
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:12,178
See, guys, that's just it.
I've been going along

213
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:13,713
With this little science experiment

214
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:16,115
To show you that the perfect
woman doesn't really exist.

215
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,817
Unless she does. Check it out.
We found a match.

216
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,885
She lives in tree hill,

217
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:22,387
And it says she's
"searching for a nice guy."

218
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,922
Who's nicer than you, mouth?
There's no photo!

219
00:10:25,005 --> 00:10:26,205
Of course not.

220
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:28,491
That's because "she"
is probably a "he."

221
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:31,209
Okay? Delete my profile.
This was a bad idea.

222
00:10:45,432 --> 00:10:47,550
I know you want get home
as soon as possible,

223
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:50,453
So I think I found us a ride
back to tree hill.

224
00:10:50,536 --> 00:10:51,687
Oh, thank god.

225
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,822
Don't thank him just yet.

226
00:10:53,905 --> 00:10:55,424
You might want to wait until
you see the ride. Whatever.

227
00:10:55,507 --> 00:10:56,624
Another five minutes,

228
00:10:56,707 --> 00:10:58,526
And you were giving me
a piggyback ride.

229
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:00,943
Funny you should say that, actually.

230
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:09,668
The driver says
they're real friendly.

231
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:11,437
You got to be kidding me.

232
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,153
I wish I were.

233
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:15,755
You boys gettin' in or what?

234
00:11:17,758 --> 00:11:20,126
You're about to see
just how much I love my wife.

235
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:31,421
Jamie: Hello?

236
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:33,538
Is anyone home?

237
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:38,893
I'm all alone in the house?

238
00:11:38,976 --> 00:11:40,795
I'm all alone in the house!

239
00:11:40,878 --> 00:11:41,878
Sweet!

240
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:53,244
I feel bad, man,
'cause I love bacon.

241
00:11:53,327 --> 00:11:55,579
And I love pork chops.

242
00:11:55,662 --> 00:11:57,114
And I love ham, you know?

243
00:11:57,197 --> 00:11:58,629
But then I met you.

244
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:01,984
Now I'm conflicted.

245
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:03,552
Look, I know you're planning

246
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:05,287
On falling insanely in love
with that pig,

247
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,203
But can we please
talk about something else?

248
00:12:08,072 --> 00:12:09,104
Sure.

249
00:12:10,545 --> 00:12:12,657
What did you have planned
for haley's birthday?

250
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:15,028
Jamie and I
bought a ton of decorations.

251
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:16,778
We were gonna do up the whole house.

252
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:20,398
Sounds nice.

253
00:12:20,481 --> 00:12:22,482
I was gonna make pork ribs.

254
00:12:37,895 --> 00:12:39,247
What's going on?

255
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,981
Well, bridge is out.

256
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:44,817
Probably flooded from the deluge
we had last night.

257
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,752
Oh. What'd I tell you?

258
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:49,321
Ain't nobody going nowhere
for a while.

259
00:12:49,404 --> 00:12:50,772
Do you have a map?

260
00:12:52,575 --> 00:12:54,676
Thanks. Okay, we are...

261
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:57,730
Okay, we're here.

262
00:12:57,813 --> 00:13:00,432
And if we just
hike a few miles north,

263
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,367
Then we'll make it
to the next highway.

264
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,868
We can just
hitch a ride home that way.

265
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,970
I, uh, I-I don't know
about that, man.

266
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:08,139
Maybe we should, uh, just --
just wait?

267
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:10,607
'cause what if we get lost?

268
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,671
Dude, I'm like a human compass,
okay? Come on.

269
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:20,783
That'll do, pigs.

270
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,067
That'll do.

271
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:26,731
Wait up!

272
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:32,157
Hey, q!

273
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,230
Someone wrote "slut"
all over your car in lipstick.

274
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:37,132
It's gonna be a bitch
getting that off.

275
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:38,982
You're right.
Her name's kylie.

276
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,613
Hey, grubbs. Thank you so much
for tending bar tonight.

277
00:13:43,696 --> 00:13:44,746
No problem.

278
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:47,441
In high school,
I was kind of a band geek.

279
00:13:47,524 --> 00:13:49,691
It's nice to come back
as a cool bartender.

280
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:54,894
As a moderately cool bartender.

281
00:13:56,263 --> 00:13:57,896
It's nice to come back
as a bartender?

282
00:14:04,336 --> 00:14:06,488
Can you guys kick in
for the pizza for once?

283
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:08,104
I am unemployed, you know.

284
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,499
Hey, I'm kylie.

285
00:14:18,582 --> 00:14:21,317
Which one of you little maniacs
is marvin mcfadden?

286
00:14:22,853 --> 00:14:23,904
Uh, that's me.

287
00:14:23,987 --> 00:14:26,139
I'm here for our date.

288
00:14:26,222 --> 00:14:28,541
I think there's been a mistake.

289
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:31,646
Your profile said that
you're tall and thin,

290
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:33,962
With a good body and really big...

291
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:37,031
...Hands.

292
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:40,653
Oh, my.

293
00:14:40,736 --> 00:14:42,855
I hear there's a dance
at the school.

294
00:14:42,938 --> 00:14:44,223
Do you want to go?

295
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:45,306
No.

296
00:14:46,474 --> 00:14:48,693
Well, I mean, yes, but

297
00:14:48,776 --> 00:14:49,894
It's just that...

298
00:14:49,977 --> 00:14:52,664
Why are <i>youon a dating ?</i>

299
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:54,866
You could get a date
with anyone on the planet.

300
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:57,583
You're not, like, a dude, are you?

301
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:05,410
Satisfied?

302
00:15:05,493 --> 00:15:06,863
Yeah.

303
00:16:06,635 --> 00:16:09,270
Oh, no.
It's mom's birthday.

304
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:35,043
I just want to say how grateful I am

305
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:39,313
That you're all
taking this ride with me.

306
00:16:39,396 --> 00:16:41,997
Now let's go make
someone's favorite movie!

307
00:16:45,334 --> 00:16:48,554
It sounded better in my head.

308
00:16:48,637 --> 00:16:49,955
Don't worry.

309
00:16:50,038 --> 00:16:52,190
I'll start the slow clap for you
if no one else does.

310
00:16:52,273 --> 00:16:54,325
What are you still doing here?

311
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:56,860
Well, it just occurred to me
that you spent the entire day

312
00:16:56,943 --> 00:16:59,196
Making everyone else
feel ready for tomorrow.

313
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,645
How do <i>you</i> feel?

314
00:17:02,348 --> 00:17:03,599
Nervous.

315
00:17:03,682 --> 00:17:05,768
I...I've been around movie sets
my whole life,

316
00:17:05,851 --> 00:17:08,003
But I've never been
in the director's chair.

317
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:10,772
I was pretty nervous, to
for my first big part.

318
00:17:10,855 --> 00:17:12,640
But I just kept asking myself,

319
00:17:12,723 --> 00:17:14,489
"how would julia roberts do it?"

320
00:17:16,392 --> 00:17:18,010
She's my favorite actress.

321
00:17:18,093 --> 00:17:20,012
So who's your favorite director?

322
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:22,881
John hughes.

323
00:17:22,964 --> 00:17:25,616
You know, "ferris bueller,"

324
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:27,851
"breakfast club," "sixteen candles."

325
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:30,920
Those weren't just movies
about teenagers.

326
00:17:31,003 --> 00:17:35,156
They were about the struggle
everyone has to find themselves.

327
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:37,458
Talk about a director
with a clear vision.

328
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:40,059
I-I'd like to make a movie
half as good as his.

329
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,461
Then why don't you take a cue
from john hughes?

330
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:43,762
Clear your vision.

331
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:45,931
Take the night off
and come to the school.

332
00:17:46,014 --> 00:17:47,480
Maybe even dance with brooke.

333
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:50,567
I don't know, alex.

334
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:54,772
I have to find an outfit
from the '80s.

335
00:17:54,855 --> 00:17:57,775
Actually, I've got that covered.

336
00:17:57,858 --> 00:17:59,643
I thought you might
change your mind.

337
00:17:59,726 --> 00:18:02,946
But just so we're clear --
this is not a date.

338
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:05,864
It's not even date-ish.

339
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:12,203
Not bad.

340
00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:34,483
Brooke davis --
stunning in any decade.

341
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,169
Hi, everyone!

342
00:18:54,252 --> 00:18:57,687
Thank you so much for coming out
and supporting the arts!

343
00:18:59,523 --> 00:19:01,742
So, please, everyone,
give what you can

344
00:19:01,825 --> 00:19:05,878
And have a gnarly,
totally tubular time!

345
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:09,897
Where's the beef?

346
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,318
Oh. Okay, um, ladies and gentlemen,

347
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:15,886
Please welcome...

348
00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:16,969
Cheap trick!

349
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,450
You notice how kylie
smelled like strawberries?

350
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:52,682
Yeah.

351
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,328
Mouth totally owes us.

352
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,481
It's a text from haley.

353
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,803
"How's it going with jamie?"

354
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:29,844
Alexander coyne,
this is haley james scott.

355
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:31,879
Hey. I'm a big fan.
Oh, thanks.

356
00:20:31,962 --> 00:20:34,497
I am -- I am, too, of your
detective work with tubbs.

357
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:38,034
You know, this is a big night
for haley.

358
00:20:39,835 --> 00:20:41,755
When we were in high school,

359
00:20:41,838 --> 00:20:44,423
She was always trying
to bring back the '80s fashion.

360
00:20:44,506 --> 00:20:45,858
You got your wish!

361
00:20:45,941 --> 00:20:48,360
Oh, I did! I did.

362
00:20:48,443 --> 00:20:49,995
Um, excuse me.

363
00:20:50,646 --> 00:20:51,663
'kay.

364
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:56,083
Grubbs, make me something...Strong.

365
00:20:59,554 --> 00:21:01,906
What?
You need to see my I.D.?

366
00:21:01,989 --> 00:21:03,523
Grubbs, you flatter me.

367
00:21:07,294 --> 00:21:08,879
I had no idea.

368
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,576
You're 5'4".

369
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:13,365
Thank you.

370
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,416
Good talk, grubbs.

371
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,662
I swear, I'm gonna kill that kid.

372
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:09,979
Come on.

373
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:38,759
So, your profile said
you like to dance.

374
00:22:38,842 --> 00:22:41,143
Maybe after a few more drinks.

375
00:22:44,212 --> 00:22:47,448
I'll be right back.

376
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:50,501
What her profile <i>should</i> have said

377
00:22:50,584 --> 00:22:51,950
Is "like millie on steroids."

378
00:23:00,224 --> 00:23:01,776
It took me four hours

379
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:04,590
To get the smoothie
out of my hair, bitch.

380
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,614
Yes, well, I'm the one
who has to drive home

381
00:23:06,697 --> 00:23:08,315
In a car with "slut"
written all over it.

382
00:23:08,398 --> 00:23:10,650
I was just trying
to increase your chances

383
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:11,952
Of getting rear-ended.

384
00:23:12,035 --> 00:23:13,820
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

385
00:23:13,903 --> 00:23:15,188
I shouldn't have
poured smoothie on you.

386
00:23:15,271 --> 00:23:16,333
I apologize.

387
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:19,257
Truce?

388
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:23,427
How american of you to pick
a fight that you can't win.

389
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,728
And just so you know,

390
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:27,130
Clay told me
that he didn't believe in love.

391
00:23:27,213 --> 00:23:29,480
So good luck with that.

392
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:49,779
The highway's this way.
I think.

393
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,448
You look on
the bright side, nate...

394
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:53,320
I mean, if we actually
live through this thing,

395
00:23:53,403 --> 00:23:54,889
Think of the endorsement deals.

396
00:23:54,972 --> 00:23:56,224
I mean, on gps units alone.

397
00:23:56,307 --> 00:23:57,926
Like, "I never would've gotten lost

398
00:23:58,009 --> 00:23:59,427
If it had only been for my --"

399
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,895
Shut up!
<i>Please</i> shut up!

400
00:24:00,978 --> 00:24:02,196
Trying to make conversation.

401
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:03,764
That's the thing -- you're talking.

402
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:04,898
You're <i>always</i> talking, man.

403
00:24:04,981 --> 00:24:06,199
Oh, I'm so sorry.

404
00:24:06,282 --> 00:24:07,667
I didn't realize
that the human compass

405
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,718
Needed complete silence
to concentrate.

406
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,772
You know, maybe we should have
stayed with the pigs.

407
00:24:14,855 --> 00:24:18,008
'cause it seems to me
that you've gotten us lost.

408
00:24:18,348 --> 00:24:19,429
Me?

409
00:24:20,286 --> 00:24:22,311
We wouldn't even be here right now

410
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,212
If you hadn't insisted
on driving to atlanta

411
00:24:24,295 --> 00:24:25,613
For a guys' road trip.

412
00:24:25,696 --> 00:24:27,481
If you hadn't have missed
tree hill in the rain,

413
00:24:27,564 --> 00:24:29,416
If you hadn't have driven over
those tire spikes,

414
00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:31,984
I would be home right now, clay!

415
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:34,086
I'm on the road for half the year!

416
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:37,055
The <i>least</i> I can do is be home
for my wife's birthday.

417
00:24:37,138 --> 00:24:39,824
Nate, I know haley.
She'll understand.

418
00:24:39,907 --> 00:24:41,226
Well, she shouldn't have to.

419
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:43,109
You'd know that
if you were ever married.

420
00:24:45,645 --> 00:24:47,897
Yeah, you're right.
I guess I would've.

421
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,198
I'm going this way.

422
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:51,500
That's -- clay,
that's not the right way!

423
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,201
Yeah, I know.
You're the human compass.

424
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,269
You know what? Just do
whatever the hell you want.

425
00:24:55,352 --> 00:24:57,086
I'm going this way.

426
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,679
It's amazing how you can enter
the building a functioning adult

427
00:25:07,762 --> 00:25:10,081
And immediately revert to the
geek you were in high school.

428
00:25:10,164 --> 00:25:11,849
I'll tell you a secret.

429
00:25:11,932 --> 00:25:13,418
I was a geek, too.

430
00:25:13,501 --> 00:25:15,501
I wore headgear until the end
of my sophomore year.

431
00:25:18,071 --> 00:25:20,023
There she is.

432
00:25:20,106 --> 00:25:22,658
So, geek, why don't you
take a chance

433
00:25:22,741 --> 00:25:25,427
And ask the popular girl to dance?

434
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,863
Maybe because the popular girl

435
00:25:27,946 --> 00:25:29,397
Is already here with somebody else.

436
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,365
I'm sure it's not
what it looks like.

437
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:32,833
It's okay.

438
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:35,535
It wouldn't be the '80s without
a cameo by crocodile dundee.

439
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,737
I just wish he wasn't
on a date with brooke.

440
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,806
Of course he showed up with alex.

441
00:25:39,889 --> 00:25:41,207
It's a retro dance, after all.

442
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,309
Why should I expect anything new?

443
00:25:43,392 --> 00:25:45,110
Alex: Just go talk to her.

444
00:25:45,193 --> 00:25:48,146
We might be in a high school,
but we're not <i>in</i> high school.

445
00:25:48,229 --> 00:25:49,463
Come on.

446
00:25:50,832 --> 00:25:52,951
Oh, god, they're coming
this way. Come on, let's hide.

447
00:25:53,034 --> 00:25:55,401
Correction -- we're definitely
back in high school.

448
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:13,770
Just, uh, grab that flower pot.

449
00:26:13,853 --> 00:26:15,776
Looks like we're gonna have to
break a window.

450
00:26:23,664 --> 00:26:25,131
I'm hit! I'm hit!

451
00:26:30,235 --> 00:26:32,130
Hold up! Hold up!
Hold up! Hold up!

452
00:26:32,213 --> 00:26:33,731
Jamie, wait!

453
00:26:33,814 --> 00:26:34,814
It's us!

454
00:26:36,015 --> 00:26:38,116
Oh. Hey, guys.

455
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:41,588
Are you gonna tell my parents?

456
00:26:41,671 --> 00:26:44,290
What, that we were stupid enough
to fall for your little prank?

457
00:26:44,373 --> 00:26:46,192
Not if you don't.

458
00:26:46,275 --> 00:26:47,293
Okay, deal.

459
00:26:47,376 --> 00:26:48,976
But I need your help.

460
00:26:54,048 --> 00:26:56,502
My locker was down there.

461
00:26:56,585 --> 00:26:57,803
Mine was over here.

462
00:26:57,886 --> 00:27:00,271
Do your remember
how lucas pimped it out

463
00:27:00,354 --> 00:27:02,206
The first day of senior year?

464
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:05,008
I wonder if the combination
still works.

465
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:06,843
Brooke davis.

466
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:07,985
What?

467
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:13,415
Shut up!
That's so bad!

468
00:27:15,876 --> 00:27:18,686
Looks like she really loves him.

469
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:20,721
Do you ever think things
were simpler then?

470
00:27:20,804 --> 00:27:21,971
What, the love triangle

471
00:27:22,072 --> 00:27:23,357
Between you, lucas, and peyton?

472
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,620
No. No.

473
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:26,359
Yeah.

474
00:27:27,378 --> 00:27:29,279
I guess love's never simple.

475
00:27:30,614 --> 00:27:31,899
All right.

476
00:27:31,982 --> 00:27:34,368
What actually happened
with you and julian?

477
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:37,037
Because I do <i>not</i> understand
why you're not together.

478
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,838
He's here with alex.

479
00:27:38,921 --> 00:27:41,172
So are you.
The boy version.

480
00:27:41,255 --> 00:27:43,207
That's different.

481
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,775
He made it clear that
she's his priority right now,

482
00:27:45,858 --> 00:27:48,310
And I think he has feelings for her.

483
00:27:48,393 --> 00:27:50,311
Whether or not he admits that,

484
00:27:50,394 --> 00:27:52,712
I can't be the girl
who's with the guy

485
00:27:52,795 --> 00:27:54,614
Who's in love with someone else.

486
00:27:54,697 --> 00:27:56,416
Not again.

487
00:27:56,499 --> 00:27:58,617
Kylie: Tell me about it.

488
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,168
Hey, is there someplace
around here a girl can lie down?

489
00:28:02,771 --> 00:28:04,972
Oh, this -- this'll do.

490
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,163
Are you okay?

491
00:28:09,246 --> 00:28:10,381
Yeah.

492
00:28:10,483 --> 00:28:13,285
I...
just need a little break.

493
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:16,554
Who is she?
I don't know.

494
00:28:18,857 --> 00:28:21,091
Okay, just, um...

495
00:28:23,728 --> 00:28:26,396
You...Take care.

496
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,619
Ow! Wait!

497
00:28:41,977 --> 00:28:44,496
G'day, mate. What can I get you?

498
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:46,013
No, let me guess -- foster's?

499
00:28:47,148 --> 00:28:49,400
Yeah, uh...

500
00:28:49,483 --> 00:28:52,769
Hey, uh, I guess it's weird for
you that I'm here with brooke.

501
00:28:52,852 --> 00:28:55,038
But, you know, just for the record,

502
00:28:55,121 --> 00:28:56,605
I'm actually a nice guy.

503
00:28:56,688 --> 00:28:57,773
Okay, nice guy.

504
00:28:57,856 --> 00:28:59,775
Well, also for the record --

505
00:28:59,858 --> 00:29:01,743
If you ever hurt her,

506
00:29:01,826 --> 00:29:04,546
I will hunt you down
across the outback.

507
00:29:04,629 --> 00:29:07,348
And I'm not talking about
the steakhouse.

508
00:29:07,431 --> 00:29:09,583
Although, I will hunt you down
there, as well.

509
00:29:10,706 --> 00:29:11,806
Fair enough.

510
00:29:14,535 --> 00:29:18,738
Well, uh, thanks for the beer, mate.

511
00:29:20,741 --> 00:29:24,375
I wouldn't last five minutes
in the outback.

512
00:29:37,551 --> 00:29:38,951
Hey, can you help?

513
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:43,111
My hair's stuck in the bloody door.

514
00:29:43,194 --> 00:29:45,780
How did that happen?

515
00:29:45,863 --> 00:29:48,572
Actually, I don't want to know.
Never mind.

516
00:29:48,655 --> 00:29:50,891
- I'll go find someone.
- No, don't go.

517
00:29:54,303 --> 00:29:58,005
I'm sorry I was such a bitch before.

518
00:29:59,607 --> 00:30:01,374
It's okay.

519
00:30:04,188 --> 00:30:05,244
No.

520
00:30:06,478 --> 00:30:08,312
It's not.

521
00:30:10,882 --> 00:30:13,350
It -- it's just...

522
00:30:15,486 --> 00:30:18,672
Clay told me
that he didn't believe in love.

523
00:30:18,755 --> 00:30:22,942
And then you come along,

524
00:30:23,025 --> 00:30:25,277
And I realized what he really meant

525
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,647
Was that he didn't believe
in love with someone like me.

526
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,483
Kylie, there's more to it than that.

527
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:32,788
No.

528
00:30:33,634 --> 00:30:36,220
Guys see me as a body,

529
00:30:36,303 --> 00:30:39,022
Someone to shag.

530
00:30:39,105 --> 00:30:40,940
I'm lucky
if they even buy me breakfast.

531
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,277
Here.

532
00:30:47,088 --> 00:30:48,098
Cut it.

533
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:49,799
What? No way.

534
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:52,001
Ugh. It's just hair.
It's gonna grow back.

535
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:53,235
No. You're drunk.

536
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:55,437
And why do you have scissors
in your purse?

537
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,506
I was gonna slash your tires.

538
00:31:00,524 --> 00:31:02,509
Just cut my hair, you bitch.

539
00:31:02,592 --> 00:31:05,827
Plus, it will still smell like
strawberries, anyway.

540
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,022
Nathan: I can't believe it.
You were right.

541
00:31:18,105 --> 00:31:19,723
Imagine that.

542
00:31:19,806 --> 00:31:22,159
It might be nice if you gave
me the benefit every now and then

543
00:31:22,242 --> 00:31:24,260
Instead of just the doubt.

544
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:26,029
You're right, man.

545
00:31:26,112 --> 00:31:27,730
I was -- I was out of line
back there.

546
00:31:27,813 --> 00:31:29,914
I'm sorry.

547
00:31:32,784 --> 00:31:35,604
Nate, there's something
that I've never told you.

548
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:38,941
And I don't know why I've never
told you, but I just didn't.

549
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:41,910
I used to be married...

550
00:31:41,993 --> 00:31:43,779
Before you and I met.

551
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:45,462
Her name was sara.

552
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:48,416
Right.

553
00:31:48,499 --> 00:31:51,953
She leave you after you started
sleeping with all those women?

554
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:54,705
No. Actually, she died.

555
00:32:02,613 --> 00:32:06,081
Geez, clay. I...

556
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,600
I'm sorry, man.

557
00:32:08,683 --> 00:32:10,584
I thought --
I thought you were joking.

558
00:32:12,753 --> 00:32:15,270
Why didn't you ever tell me this?

559
00:32:15,353 --> 00:32:18,173
I was your agent.

560
00:32:18,256 --> 00:32:20,373
And then you became my friend.

561
00:32:20,456 --> 00:32:23,475
Look, I know that I should have
told you a long time ago,

562
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:26,142
But I'm telling you now

563
00:32:26,225 --> 00:32:29,177
Because I get
how hard it is for you...

564
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,661
Being away from haley so much.

565
00:32:37,934 --> 00:32:39,952
Whoa, slow, slow, slow!

566
00:32:40,035 --> 00:32:41,353
No, whoa, whoa!

567
00:32:41,436 --> 00:32:44,336
Aah! Don't hurt me!

568
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,290
Ma'am, no, no.
We're not gonna hurt you.

569
00:32:46,373 --> 00:32:47,625
It's just my friend here...

570
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:49,627
You see, he's been wandering
through the woods

571
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,928
For the entire day,

572
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,729
And all he wants to do
is get back to tree hill

573
00:32:52,812 --> 00:32:55,698
So he can spend the next
few hours home with his wife

574
00:32:55,781 --> 00:32:58,133
To celebrate her birthday.

575
00:32:58,216 --> 00:33:00,517
You're nathan scott.

576
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:03,837
You're a basketball fan, huh?

577
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,440
Well, I do live
in north carolina, honey.

578
00:33:07,523 --> 00:33:09,942
I can take you back to tree hill.

579
00:33:10,025 --> 00:33:12,493
But I only have room for one.

580
00:33:14,396 --> 00:33:16,915
Tell haley I said happy birthday.

581
00:33:16,998 --> 00:33:19,150
There's no way I'm leaving you out here.
No, it's okay.

582
00:33:19,233 --> 00:33:20,952
I'll catch the next ride.

583
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:22,820
Clay, come on.
Nate.

584
00:33:22,903 --> 00:33:25,004
Go be home with your wife.

585
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,211
Go.

586
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,879
Thanks.

587
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:02,939
Please tell me
you didn't kill that nice lady

588
00:34:03,022 --> 00:34:05,978
And dump her body because
there's no way I can spin that.

589
00:34:06,061 --> 00:34:07,374
No, I just bought her car.

590
00:34:08,664 --> 00:34:10,282
Get in.
Let's go home.

591
00:34:36,252 --> 00:34:38,737
It's funny.

592
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,007
I always had a thing
for the guys in shop class.

593
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,275
What happened to your date?

594
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:46,978
Come on.
We're just friends.

595
00:34:47,061 --> 00:34:49,295
Ah, the irony is palpable.

596
00:34:53,032 --> 00:34:58,037
You know I wasn't trying
to make you jealous, right?

597
00:34:58,236 --> 00:35:00,088
You said you weren't coming,

598
00:35:00,171 --> 00:35:01,174
So...

599
00:35:02,807 --> 00:35:04,641
Why did you?

600
00:35:06,243 --> 00:35:10,330
It was a misguided attempt
to find some clarity

601
00:35:10,413 --> 00:35:14,166
On the night before the biggest
day of my professional life.

602
00:35:14,249 --> 00:35:16,468
But going back to high school

603
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:18,903
Just makes me feel like a geek.

604
00:35:18,986 --> 00:35:21,320
Not exactly a confidence booster.

605
00:35:24,591 --> 00:35:27,344
Well, I've seen
my share of '80s movies,

606
00:35:27,427 --> 00:35:29,445
And if I've learned anything

607
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:31,847
Is that nothing
boosts the geek's confidence

608
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,564
Like a kiss from the cheerleader.

609
00:35:47,008 --> 00:35:49,794
I'll see you at work tomorrow.

610
00:35:49,877 --> 00:35:52,678
You're gonna do great.

611
00:36:00,919 --> 00:36:02,252
Hey, brooke?

612
00:36:06,189 --> 00:36:08,809
This isn't gonna be easy, is it?

613
00:36:08,892 --> 00:36:10,862
You and I being friends.

614
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,266
No.

615
00:36:15,997 --> 00:36:17,649
But it's better

616
00:36:17,732 --> 00:36:19,532
Than not being in each other's
lives at all.

617
00:37:03,169 --> 00:37:04,320
Hey, there.

618
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:06,370
I'm alexander.

619
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,268
You have any idea
where our dates are?

620
00:37:09,351 --> 00:37:11,427
Hopefully somewhere together.

621
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,244
That doesn't bother you?

622
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,865
Some advice,
from one alex to another --

623
00:37:17,948 --> 00:37:20,167
Don't fall in love
with brooke davis.

624
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,823
Those two are gonna end up together,
even if they don't know it yet.

625
00:37:23,453 --> 00:37:25,071
Yeah, okay.

626
00:37:25,154 --> 00:37:27,006
Um, well, how do you know, then?

627
00:37:27,089 --> 00:37:29,375
Brooke still loves julian.

628
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:31,410
And I know because...

629
00:37:31,493 --> 00:37:33,326
So do I.

630
00:37:51,441 --> 00:37:54,293
Well, whose car is this?

631
00:37:54,376 --> 00:37:56,310
It's yours.

632
00:37:59,013 --> 00:38:01,214
Happy birthday, hales.

633
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,001
It's not that bad.

634
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,012
Bollocks.
It looks bloody awful.

635
00:38:19,283 --> 00:38:21,936
But you have been a trooper.

636
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:23,720
So we can go and have a shag.

637
00:38:26,491 --> 00:38:29,877
I can't believe I'm actually
gonna say this, but, um...

638
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,012
I can't.

639
00:38:31,095 --> 00:38:32,680
I mean, I can, but...

640
00:38:32,763 --> 00:38:34,215
We can't.

641
00:38:34,298 --> 00:38:35,917
Right.

642
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,053
So your flat or mine?

643
00:38:39,136 --> 00:38:40,688
No, I'm serious.

644
00:38:40,771 --> 00:38:43,522
It's not that I don't want to.
Believe me, I do.

645
00:38:43,605 --> 00:38:45,122
It's just...

646
00:38:45,205 --> 00:38:48,790
my ex-girlfriend,
who is also my roommate.

647
00:38:48,873 --> 00:38:50,139
It's messy.

648
00:38:52,109 --> 00:38:53,827
But we could go get some pancakes,

649
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,562
Maybe soak up some of that alcohol.

650
00:38:55,645 --> 00:38:58,197
Your profile was right.

651
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,366
You are a nice guy.

652
00:39:00,449 --> 00:39:03,584
It's good to know
there's still a few out there.

653
00:39:06,253 --> 00:39:07,854
Thank you.

654
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:15,560
Are you ready to move on?

655
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:18,730
Yeah.

656
00:39:36,976 --> 00:39:38,496
I'm sorry I missed your dance.

657
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:39,797
It's okay.

658
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,943
- Is this where you went to school, huh?
- Yeah.

659
00:39:42,378 --> 00:39:44,464
Show me around?
Okay.

660
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:03,150
Well, I guess junk and fergie
actually did a good job.

661
00:40:03,233 --> 00:40:05,920
Maybe we should bump them up
on the babysitting list.

662
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:07,269
Let's get him to bed.

663
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,599
Happy birthday, mama.

664
00:40:19,682 --> 00:40:21,782
Thank you, baby.

665
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,785
What are you gonna wish for?

666
00:40:44,868 --> 00:40:48,470
I already have
everything I ever wanted.

667
00:40:59,147 --> 00:41:00,932
So I just want to say
how grateful I am

668
00:41:01,015 --> 00:41:03,134
That you're all
taking this ride with me.

669
00:41:03,217 --> 00:41:06,218
So, let's make
someone's favorite movie.

670
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,323
Okay, places, everyone.

671
00:41:15,259 --> 00:41:16,426
Man: Picture's up.

672
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,649
Roll camera.

673
00:41:20,732 --> 00:41:22,432
We're rolling.

674
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:25,335
Spinning.

675
00:41:27,104 --> 00:41:28,304
Scene 34, take one.

676
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:38,178
And action!
