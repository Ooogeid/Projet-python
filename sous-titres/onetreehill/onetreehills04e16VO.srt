00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,500
<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill</i>.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,116
I'm chaperoning at the prom.

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,954
We still need a couple of parents.

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,000
You're asking me to the prom?

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,400
You made fun of my Mom's death, Brooke.

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,747
It hurt. It did.

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,484
Not anymore, 'cause you and me--
we're done.

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,824
She's dead.

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,906
As far as I'm concerned, so are you.

10
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,200
Peyton...

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,400
Your boot's off. You can walk on it?

12
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,700
Yep. Even better, I'm gonna dance on it.

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,900
I'm coming back later,
and I'm picking you up.

14
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,638
If you open that door.

15
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,034
I know that you're gonna look beautiful.

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,543
And if not, I guess I'm going alone.

17
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,700
Lucas.

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,600
Hi, Peyton.

19
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:10,170
I guess I have my answer.

20
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,000
I can't believe he actually left.

21
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,985
I would never give up on you
that easily.

22
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,317
You hear me?

23
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:27,203
Our love is forever.

24
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,206
So, when you took your boot off,
was it all...

25
00:01:53,726 --> 00:01:55,093
It was like <i>Teen Wolf</i>.

26
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Seriously, I had to use
three razor blades.

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,612
Nice.

28
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,758
I'm proud of you, Hales.

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,980
My girl went strong
to be rehabbed by prom.

30
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,445
Well, at least everything
will be perfect tonight.

31
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,553
We got to stop saying that.

32
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,118
Since when have the chaperones been
prettier than the prom queens?

33
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,356
Thanks, but I'm with someone.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,001
Hi, Whitey.

35
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,397
- You look handsome.
- Thank you.

36
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,435
Well, I better go see
if Principal Turner needs anything.

37
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,325
What the hell are you doing?

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,871
I'm making the rest of you guys
look bad.

39
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,100
Years ago, I watched you
screw up Karen's life.

40
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,700
I'm not gonna allow history
to repeat itself.

41
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,455
And yet you've been trying
to make that tux work since the '70s.

42
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,456
I'll be watching you, Danny.

43
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,139
I think --
I think the fan belt snapped.

44
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,075
Maybe it's the --
the thingamajig.

45
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,800
Can I please call Lucas now?

46
00:03:25,895 --> 00:03:27,300
I have no signal.

47
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,800
Oh, great.

48
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,199
Well, there's a convenience store
about a mile up ahead.

49
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:34,399
I'll just walk there
and call for a ride, I guess.

50
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,997
- You can stay.
- No, thank you.

51
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:38,238
A pregnant girl in a prom dress
with a broken-down car

52
00:03:38,347 --> 00:03:39,899
is how urban legends get started.

53
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:42,142
- I'm coming with you.
- What about your leg?

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,100
It'll be a good test.
Come on.

55
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,612
This is the final boarding call
for flight 121,

56
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,000
service to New Orleans.

57
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,256
Good.

58
00:04:26,587 --> 00:04:27,598
You're awake.

59
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:32,408
I'm sorry about the...

60
00:04:33,145 --> 00:04:37,100
sedative, but there were just
so many last-minute details.

61
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,400
I missed you, Peyton,
so much.

62
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,608
Oh, God, I missed that smell.

63
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,500
You're probably wondering
how I got out of jail.

64
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,116
Miss Sawyer?

65
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:09,000
Detective Wilcox here.

66
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,500
We're just calling to let you know
we have your stalker in custody.

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,397
You know, I've had a lot of time

68
00:05:29,452 --> 00:05:32,294
to think about what went wrong
with us last time.

69
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,500
A girl like you needs romance.

70
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
I get that now.

71
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,999
So that's why you and I

72
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:50,132
are gonna have our own private prom.

73
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,311
Just...

74
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:01,329
The two of us.

Version 1.1

77
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,599
Hey, I'm so sorry
to hear about your dress.

78
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,000
I had no idea.

79
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,497
It's okay.
I got most of it off.

80
00:06:59,538 --> 00:07:01,400
Now when you black-light me,
it just says "ho."

81
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,800
So... Where is she, anyway?

82
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,799
I went over to her house
to pick her up,

83
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,666
but she wouldn't even open the door.

84
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,384
I guess she's not coming.

85
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,249
I need to leave for a little while.

86
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,697
Sure. Where we going?

87
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,700
All right, take it easy on the turns.

88
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,057
My grandpa Mel loosened the suspension.

89
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,262
I'll be back in time
for my coronation.

90
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,739
Aren't they still voting for prom queen?

91
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,600
Yeah, but it's really
just a formality.

92
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,900
You know, the hardest part
about the night we broke up...

93
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,600
It wasn't your betrayal.

94
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,200
It wasn't even falling out
of a second-story window.

95
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,162
The hardest part

96
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:15,900
was losing my photos.

97
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,100
Now I have to start it all over.

98
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
Smile, Peyton.

99
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:38,393
Thanks for picking us up, Mom.

100
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Just think, I couldn't have done this
a month ago.

101
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,690
Maybe I just would have spent
a lot more time on the sidewalk.

102
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,300
Pretend I'm not here.

103
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,300
Sorry.

104
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,800
This isn't exactly how I wanted to start
our romantic prom night.

105
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,900
That's okay.

106
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,485
After everything we've been through
in the past year,

107
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,989
your Mom taking us to prom
feels pretty good.

108
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,200
- Kind of like we're kids again?
- Yeah, like, I don't know--

109
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,599
Tonight we don't have
to be married and pregnant.

110
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,100
We can just be teenagers.

111
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,900
Well, in that case,
what's your curfew?

112
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,800
<i>You've reached Peyton's voice mail.</i>

113
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,700
<i>Congratulations.</i>

114
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:56,000
Peyton, this isn't right.

115
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,813
You're the one I want to be with
tonight, prom or not.

116
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,300
So call me, okay?

117
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,729
Please.

118
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,140
Miss Gattina, you're no longer
allowed on school grounds.

119
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,475
What are you gonna do, expel me?

120
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,433
Don't make me call the police.

121
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,206
Fine.

122
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,799
All right, I've got a limo
and a fully stocked minibar.

123
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,833
Who's with me?

124
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This school sucks.

125
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,610
Rachel, wait.

126
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,700
I'm coming with you.

127
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:45,078
What about Brooke?

128
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,198
If she were here,
she'd do the same thing.

129
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,793
That's what friends do.

130
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,001
See you, Turner.

131
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,818
Expect a call from my lawyer
about the sexual harassment.

132
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,500
She's kidding.

133
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,506
Relax, Turner.

134
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,966
You need a drink.
In fact...

135
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:11,708
I confiscated this flask
off one of your students.

136
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,361
Give me a minute, Karen.

137
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,966
It's time for our first dance.

138
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,701
This song is special.

139
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,300
I made it from your podcasts.

140
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,200
I hope you see now
how much thought I put into tonight.

141
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,050
That's why I couldn't have you
going to prom with Lucas

142
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,617
and afterwards,

143
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:06,942
giving yourself to him.

144
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,248
I couldn't allow that, Peyton.

145
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
You belong to me.

146
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,200
We are gonna have the perfect prom.

147
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,913
And afterwards,
we're gonna go up to your bedroom

148
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,143
and have the perfect prom night.

149
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,999
Well, another text from Lucas.

150
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:55,656
Let's see what it says.

151
00:12:58,036 --> 00:12:59,362
"I'm so sorry."

152
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,100
"Please talk to me."

153
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,200
"Prom sucks without you."

154
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Let's reply.

155
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,380
Sorry.

156
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,608
Running late.

157
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,800
Wait for me.

158
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:16,111
Hugs and kisses.

159
00:13:18,484 --> 00:13:20,507
Is an emoticon too much, you think?

160
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:25,374
Oh, what the hell?
Semicolon, close parenthesis.

161
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:39,600
Glenda, you look great.

162
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,783
Thank you.

163
00:13:41,448 --> 00:13:43,979
So I guess I'm not the only one
alone at prom.

164
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,589
Maybe Lucas Scott
really is a goth at heart.

165
00:13:47,085 --> 00:13:48,700
Peyton's on her way, finally.

166
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,700
But, you know,
I could use company until she gets here.

167
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,782
Good, 'cause I could use someone

168
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:57,171
to help me pretend
I'm above all this prom stuff.

169
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:01,384
Good news.

170
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,499
Nobody is using the "DW not I" car
tonight, so it's all ours.

171
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,500
- Sweet!
- You ready to dance?

172
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,910
Definitely.

173
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,999
Definitely not.
I think I failed the test.

174
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,699
Okay, sit down.
It's all right.

175
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,700
No, it's not okay.

176
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,734
Don't you always say at some point,
you just gotta deal with the pain?

177
00:14:18,802 --> 00:14:20,600
Yeah, well, I'm an idiot.

178
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,700
I'm gonna get you some punch.

179
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,200
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

180
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:38,100
Honey, that ain't punch.

181
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,799
Not bad, huh?

182
00:14:39,974 --> 00:14:42,461
Yeah, they shanghaied my flask
when I came in,

183
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,899
but I went to plan B,
so it's all--

184
00:14:43,998 --> 00:14:44,998
You spiked the punch?

185
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,500
Dude, it's prom.

186
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,500
My wife's pregnant,
you idiot.

187
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,300
Dude, it's prom.

188
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,101
Dude.

189
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's prom.

190
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:29,907
You see that guy over there?

191
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,671
He's got a key to a room
at the Holiday Inn

192
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,489
and a box of wine
cooling in the mini fridge.

193
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,700
You do this a lot?

194
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,643
Helps kill time
when you live on the sidelines.

195
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,421
Okay, it's your turn.

196
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,634
She's wondering

197
00:15:51,643 --> 00:15:55,434
if she should forgive the guy
for being an ass for the last 17 years.

198
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,206
Your Mom, right?

199
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
And Daddy.

200
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,771
Come on, Peyton.
Your car is in the driveway,

201
00:16:16,772 --> 00:16:17,900
I know you're home.

202
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,799
Okay, Peyton,
your curling iron is still on,

203
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,899
so if you wanna make it
look like you're not here,

204
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,500
at least make it convincing.

205
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,300
Great.

206
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,363
Hide in your creepy basement
because you know I hate it.

207
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,710
Too bad.

208
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,497
I'm coming down anyway.

209
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,229
Oh, my God.

210
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,100
Well, well, Brooke Davis.

211
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,599
One kiss wasn't enough
so you came back for a second?

212
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,624
Get off me.

213
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,000
What happened?
I thought you were leaving tonight.

214
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,939
My flight got delayed by a few hours.

215
00:17:59,457 --> 00:18:00,756
Just enough time to crash prom.

216
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,013
We'll hang out, and then
I'll take you back to the airport.

217
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,599
You sure?
I mean, it's your prom night.

218
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,270
Yeah, but it's your last night.

219
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,100
Besides, prom just makes me
think about Shelly.

220
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,298
All right, Mouth,
talk to me.

221
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,248
I can't stop thinking about her.

222
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:21,952
Her eyes, her smile, those--

223
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:25,177
Those little freckles
on the small of her back.

224
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,400
Hang on.
The small of her back?

225
00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:30,956
The clean teen gave it up.

226
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:32,719
Nice work.

227
00:18:33,202 --> 00:18:35,320
Yeah, so nice
she never wants to see me again.

228
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,125
Welcome to the rest of your life.

229
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,000
Sex changes everything.

230
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,700
Let's not talk about Shelly.

231
00:18:43,762 --> 00:18:45,416
This is your night.
What do you wanna do?

232
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,907
Well, I wanted to deflower you,

233
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,380
but I guess I'm too late for that.

234
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,297
I wanna do what you wanna do.

235
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,007
- I want to get Shelly back.
- Except that.

236
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:57,200
Shelly is nuts,

237
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,417
and this is coming from a girl
who has seen a lot of nuts.

238
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,001
I know, but...

239
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:06,139
She made me feel dangerous,
you know?

240
00:19:07,315 --> 00:19:09,173
Like I was more than myself.

241
00:19:09,406 --> 00:19:11,251
Mouth, quit talking about Shelly.

242
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:13,176
- Yeah, I'm boring you.
- No.

243
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:15,580
You're making me jealous.

244
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,900
So, when do I get
the next chapter of your book?

245
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,442
Or is that your strategy?

246
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,430
Get me hooked and leave me hanging?

247
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,910
No, that's not it.

248
00:19:29,608 --> 00:19:30,879
Truth is, I'm stuck...

249
00:19:31,566 --> 00:19:33,331
On the day my uncle Keith died.

250
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,166
I'm sure it's hard to revisit that day.

251
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,422
But telling the truth about it
could help a lot of people.

252
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Maybe even you.

253
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,574
See, that's just it.

254
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:46,652
I have trouble with the details.

255
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:49,872
There's a lot of things about that day
I can't remember.

256
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,335
You know, kind of like I blocked it out.

257
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,100
Well, tell you what,

258
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,535
why don't you walk me through the things
you <i>can</i> remember?

259
00:19:58,802 --> 00:20:00,839
Maybe it'll help to talk it through.

260
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,305
All right.

261
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:11,947
It's a good thing I brought extra rope.

262
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,100
Untie me, you freak!

263
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,700
Figures you'd be good with your mouth.

264
00:20:23,545 --> 00:20:25,964
No one is gonna hear you.

265
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:33,100
Help!

266
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,606
You know, Peyton,

267
00:20:37,886 --> 00:20:41,299
you really shouldn't play
your music so loud.

268
00:20:41,392 --> 00:20:43,961
Help!

269
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,799
This is the weirdest prom ever.

270
00:21:13,997 --> 00:21:16,392
No Peyton, no Brooke,
no Lucas, no Mouth.

271
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:17,499
No Rachel.

272
00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:19,200
Good prom.

273
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,500
Nathan, I need you
to drive a student home.

274
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,900
- What do you mean?
- You have the DW not I car, don't you?

275
00:21:26,643 --> 00:21:29,000
Yeah, I guess I do.
Who is it?

276
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,100
Why did you come?

277
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,137
We've been talking about senior prom
since we were 8.

278
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,734
I knew something was wrong.

279
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,257
So you told someone
you were coming?

280
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,514
No, why--

281
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,099
At least I came.

282
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,599
You should have told somebody.

283
00:21:57,756 --> 00:21:59,888
That is your problem,
you are so ungrateful.

284
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,961
- You're an idiot.
- Don't call me an idiot, bitch.

285
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,600
I hope he kills you first.

286
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:06,200
That's a good idea.

287
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,600
I know how much you hate her, Peyton.

288
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,439
I was outside today, watching.

289
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,800
I heard you tell Brooke
that she was dead to you.

290
00:22:25,602 --> 00:22:28,300
Now I'm gonna make it official.

291
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Derek, wait.

292
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,600
Don't you see, Peyton?

293
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,000
I have been searching for some way
to show you how much I love you.

294
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,400
I am gonna hurt her
as much as she hurt you.

295
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,391
Look at me.

296
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,500
If you really, really love me...

297
00:22:52,449 --> 00:22:53,460
Let me do it.

298
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,999
This is my chance for revenge.

299
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,500
You more than anybody
should know that.

300
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,500
Look, you were right about me.

301
00:23:04,804 --> 00:23:06,500
Look at me.
You were right.

302
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,700
We are so much alike.

303
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,030
I have all the same feelings
that you do,

304
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,093
and I have all the same desires.

305
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,500
I don't believe you.

306
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,900
It's true.

307
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,635
I just couldn't admit it before.

308
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,617
I'm gonna prove it to you now,
just untie me.

309
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,700
You're lying.

310
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,615
Come on, Derek.

311
00:23:35,937 --> 00:23:39,200
You've got the knife,
and I'm half your size.

312
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:42,900
Hey, baby.

313
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
You better not be lying, Peyton.

314
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,140
I'm not, baby.

315
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:09,475
I promise.

316
00:24:23,198 --> 00:24:24,661
God, that felt good!

317
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,301
Do it again.

318
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,126
Why don't you make it hurt
next time, bitch?

319
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,953
All right, give me the knife.

320
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,180
I'm gonna finish this bitch off.

321
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,300
Give me the knife.

322
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,688
I don't think I can trust you.

323
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,200
Let's talk about trust, okay?

324
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,000
See, you lied to me.

325
00:24:58,507 --> 00:25:00,160
You said you were my brother,
didn't you?

326
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,400
You went about everything all wrong,
Derek.

327
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,439
My God, you're--

328
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:08,500
You're such a beautiful boy.

329
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,547
All you had to do was ask.

330
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,630
Now, how about you give me the knife?

331
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,839
And then when I'm finished with her,

332
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:26,397
we'll go upstairs, okay?

333
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,302
You want to cut vertically.

334
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,742
It's counterintuitive.

335
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I know.

336
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,100
All those times you said
I was a back-stabbing bitch,

337
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,925
you had no idea how right you were.

338
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,292
God, did you have to hit me so hard?

339
00:26:05,293 --> 00:26:07,400
I'm so sorry.

340
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,900
Peyton, he's moving.

341
00:26:10,354 --> 00:26:11,515
Just get out of here.

342
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,829
No, I'm not leaving you.

343
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,700
That was so disappointing.

344
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,500
Oh, God.

345
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,658
You know what?

346
00:26:21,638 --> 00:26:22,700
I changed my mind.

347
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,511
I think I'll kill you first.

348
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,000
Peyton, run!

349
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,600
Yeah, Peyton.

350
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Run.

351
00:26:45,949 --> 00:26:47,397
You shouldn't lie, Peyton.

352
00:26:47,976 --> 00:26:49,200
It's not very nice.

353
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,613
So this is where Peyton and I
hid the day of the shooting.

354
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,675
She told me she loved me.

355
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,700
I just figured it was because
she lost a lot of blood.

356
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,998
But on some level,
I knew it was true.

357
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,492
I was just too afraid to admit it

358
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,610
because I didn't want to hurt Brooke.

359
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,110
You ever think maybe that's why
you can't write about that day?

360
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,199
Maybe you block things out because...

361
00:27:30,308 --> 00:27:31,900
you're afraid if you face the truth,

362
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,317
it could hurt the other people you love.

363
00:27:40,293 --> 00:27:42,439
So I heard about you and Brooke Davis.

364
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,900
High five.

365
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,699
Well, I guess that means you guys
have, like, an open marriage.

366
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,309
That is so great.

367
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:51,757
- Out.
- What?

368
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:53,267
- But my house is like a mile--
- Out.

369
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,702
Cool.

370
00:27:55,853 --> 00:27:57,206
I'll see you guys Monday.

371
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,075
You still want to be a teenager?

372
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,020
Oh, my gosh.

373
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,299
You know, I used to dream

374
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,671
about how wonderful
senior prom would be--

375
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,499
The last great party with our friends
before we graduate.

376
00:28:15,547 --> 00:28:16,547
This night?

377
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,100
This is nothing like I predicted.

378
00:28:19,284 --> 00:28:21,800
Yeah, well, you gotta be careful
about your predictions.

379
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,500
The school is back that way,
where we going?

380
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,700
It's a surprise.

381
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,300
Open the door, Peyton.

382
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,100
You already know
I can break it down.

383
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,000
You forgot to lock it.

384
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,319
I didn't forget.

385
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,570
Doesn't feel too good,
does it?

386
00:29:39,202 --> 00:29:41,198
I'm not gonna run from you anymore,
Derek.

387
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,500
I'm not gonna run anymore, period.
Now get up.

388
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,399
You've been training.

389
00:30:00,489 --> 00:30:02,600
That's right, with my real brother.

390
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,100
He taught me this.

391
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,599
That is for making me afraid
to sleep at night,

392
00:30:14,702 --> 00:30:17,100
you creepy, hair-smelling
son of a bitch.

393
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:35,406
Did you really think you could beat me?

394
00:30:36,737 --> 00:30:37,737
A girl?

395
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,751
How about two girls?

396
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,540
I'll get you, I'll get you!

397
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:52,638
Brooke, kick him!

398
00:30:59,846 --> 00:31:01,903
Get off me!

399
00:31:23,435 --> 00:31:25,212
Peyton, 8th grade cheer camp!

400
00:31:40,489 --> 00:31:42,355
Hated the bottom of that pyramid.

401
00:31:42,731 --> 00:31:44,945
I know, you bitched about it all summer.

402
00:31:48,732 --> 00:31:50,775
Peyton, be careful, he's gonna lunge.

403
00:31:51,507 --> 00:31:52,736
They always lunge.

404
00:32:05,804 --> 00:32:07,136
I'm gonna call 911.

405
00:32:07,765 --> 00:32:08,770
Brooke, wait.

406
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:11,730
Give me five minutes.

407
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,900
Look, about earlier today...

408
00:32:50,705 --> 00:32:53,712
You were right. All those things
that I said about your mom--

409
00:32:54,962 --> 00:32:56,944
We both said a lot of things today.

410
00:32:58,605 --> 00:33:00,641
Besides, if you hadn't come,
right now i'd--

411
00:33:01,024 --> 00:33:03,879
i'd be bitching to both my moms
about you in person.

412
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,310
You saved me.

413
00:33:09,258 --> 00:33:10,310
You saved me, too.

414
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,400
I guess now it's hoes over psychos.

415
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,300
So where do we go from here?

416
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,610
Prom?

417
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,629
You know...

418
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,094
I lied to you when I told you
my flight was delayed.

419
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,700
The truth is,
I just wasn't ready to get on it.

420
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,633
Why not?

421
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,900
Because I wanted us
to have our last dance.

422
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,600
Let's have it.

423
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,126
You're gonna break a lot of hearts,
Mouth McFadden.

424
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,289
So what do you think?
Does this beat our prom?

425
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,009
Let's see.

426
00:34:44,186 --> 00:34:47,712
The theme for our prom
was "every rose has its thorn."

427
00:34:47,762 --> 00:34:48,773
Right.

428
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,899
That night I also told you I was leaving
to take the basketball scholarship.

429
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,899
I want you to know that,
for the past 17 years,

430
00:34:59,943 --> 00:35:02,649
I've been pretending
that that was the right choice.

431
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,296
For the last 17 years,

432
00:35:04,297 --> 00:35:07,361
I've been pretending
that choice didn't break my heart.

433
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,534
I want to ask you something.

434
00:35:13,656 --> 00:35:16,581
Do you think it's impossible for you
ever to have feelings for me again?

435
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
Like you once did?

436
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,015
It's not impossible.

437
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,888
What are we doing here?

438
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,512
Well, do you remember
the last time we were up here?

439
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,493
Yeah, I do.
It was when we were separated.

440
00:35:42,494 --> 00:35:43,600
I try to forget.

441
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,259
Well, you showed me the predictions

442
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,851
that you and Lucas make every year
on the first day of school.

443
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,299
And, well, I made a prediction of my own
that night, remember?

444
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,835
Haley and I will be together again
by graduation.

445
00:36:08,939 --> 00:36:10,415
Did you really believe that?

446
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,566
I was in a pretty dark place back then,
but...

447
00:36:14,804 --> 00:36:16,600
I never stopped believing in us.

448
00:36:20,198 --> 00:36:21,934
My prediction came true, Hales.

449
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,300
As far as I'm concerned,
that makes this a great night.

450
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,999
So... Think that leg's ready
for a dance?

451
00:36:31,953 --> 00:36:34,300
I wish it were,
but it's still a little stiff.

452
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,400
- Sorry.
- Then we won't use it.

453
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,900
Well, it's my lucky night.

454
00:37:11,503 --> 00:37:12,542
That's me.

455
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,200
I guess this is goodbye.

456
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,472
I'm really glad you came back tonight,
Rachel.

457
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,406
Me too.

458
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,033
You want to come with me?

459
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,100
I can't.
I'd miss finals and graduation.

460
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,800
It's suicidal.

461
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,900
It's just dangerous.

462
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,300
It's okay, Mouth.

463
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,529
See you later.

464
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,300
Rachel, wait.

465
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,415
I'm coming with you.

466
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,901
So it's you.

467
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,810
What do you mean?

468
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,101
You lost your phone.

469
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,575
- That's not my phone.
- You sure?

470
00:39:15,523 --> 00:39:16,794
What's wrong with you?

471
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,900
Where's my Mom?

472
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,129
She's--

473
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,200
I'm sorry.
I just...

474
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,600
What are you doing here, Lucas?

475
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,900
I guess I just keep feeling like--

476
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,799
I keep feeling like
Keith's trying to tell me something.

477
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,702
We already had this conversation, son.

478
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,744
- I know, but--
- No. Keith's dead.

479
00:39:40,787 --> 00:39:41,944
He's not coming back.

480
00:39:42,235 --> 00:39:43,247
Open your eyes.

481
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,869
Open your eyes, Luke.

482
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,000
Open your eyes.

483
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,100
- Keith.
- Luke.

484
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,615
I love you, now go.

485
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,939
You ready for this, Brooke Davis?

486
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,200
Welcome to prom, P. Sawyer.

487
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,400
Attention, everyone,

488
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,200
gather around the stage,
it's time to announce our prom queen.

489
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,400
All right,
and this year's prom queen...

490
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,600
Brooke Davis.
