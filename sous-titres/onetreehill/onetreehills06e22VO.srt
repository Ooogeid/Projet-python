2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,000
for you,miss lauren.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,930
Thank you,jamie.

4
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,660
They're from my uncle skills.

5
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,990
He thinks you're cute.

00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,500
Antwon "skills" taylor
crashing a 5-year-olds' dance?

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,930
Skills: I was hoping to see you.

8
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,390
I'm moving nino to shooting guard,and
I'm keeping you at the point.

9
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,590
With me at the point,you're
gonna get more chances to score.

10
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,880
All right?I'll get you the ball.

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,100
'Cause if you can do
that,the scouts will come.

12
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,440
I have a letter for you
from your birth mother.

13
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,900
You've been going to that
coffee shop for months.

14
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,420
You must want something from
her,even if it's just closure.

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,460
Peyton has aondition
called placenta previa.

16
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,100
Lucas,come on,what if
everything doesn't go perfectly?

17
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,050
She could die,and... and the baby,too.

The honorary title,matthew
ryan,the cure,audioslave,

22
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,990
haley james scott --
they're all in here.

23
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,020
It's music to set your life to.

24
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:09,220
AnD...music always helps,no
matter what you're going through.

25
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:16,260
So,if you flunk a big test or
you have a really bad break-up...

26
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,790
...or you just miss
someone so bad,it hurts...

27
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,360
...Then listen to my playlist -

28
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,400
"100 songs to save your
life" -- and it should help.

29
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:38,840
Oh,and there is this new artist that is really
special,and her second album is just about to comouT.

30
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,470
So you should check her out.

31
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,860
Her name's mia catalano.

32
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:55,010
This road   is anything but simple

33
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,560
twisted like a riddle

34
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,000
I've seen high,and I've seen low

35
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,430
so loud   the voices over my doubts

36
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,020
are telling me to give up

37
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,310
to pack up and leave town

38
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,940
but even so,I had to believe

39
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:28,340
oh,impossible means nothing to me

40
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,210
so,can you lift me up?

41
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,330
A best friend -- okay,this
one is so important.

42
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,150
Choose wisely,okay?

43
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,230
I got really lucky with mine.

44
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:49,340
My best friend is funny...
intelligent... creative...

45
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:56,530
beautiful... and
successful... and very kind.

46
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,800
And she's also...
...Impulsive,frustrating,

47
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,140
um...complicated,childish.

48
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,100
But I would not have her any other way.

49
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:16,810
And the best part about brooke davis
is that she always puts friends first.

50
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,860
So...if you are ever in any kind
of trouble,now you know who to call.

51
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,980
I can't think of anyone I would
rather have watching over you.

52
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,310
it's been a month,brooke.

53
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,080
You've got to stop
spying on them like this.

54
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,380
Thank you,concernicus.

55
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,280
How would you know what I've been up to?

56
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,600
'Cause I've been
watching the both of you.

57
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,600
Iced coffee with skim milk
-- it'll change your life.

58
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,310
She's eating pecan pie.

59
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,980
She doesn't even like  pecan pie.

60
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,880
Being a kid without a mom really sucks.

61
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,080
And I know this because
I've been there... twice.

62
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,680
And if you're watching this,then it
means that you're  in that place,too.

63
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,120
And I'm so sorry for that.

64
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:24,590
But if you ever need a mom-and-dad
fix,you have nathan and haley for that.

65
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,720
Gotcha!I gotcha now!

66
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,900
No! No!

67
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,420
Okay,easy.

68
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,870
If he pees his pants,you're
on laundry duty.

69
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,160
You look pretty,mama.

70
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,590
Oh,thanks,buddy.

71
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,320
I got to go.I'm late.

72
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:42,120
I got to pick up mia from the studio and
go over to peyton's for her baby shower.

73
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,480
Do you think you can drop him
off on your way out of town?

74
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,520
Lucas is gonna watch him.

75
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,830
Sure,no problem.

76
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,520
Thank you.

77
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,410
I'm gonna miss you so much.

78
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,420
Call me after the game,okay?

79
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,100
- Yeah.
- Okay ByE.

80
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,020
I'll see you later.Peyton's waiting.

81
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,020
- Bye.
- Bye! Bye.

82
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,250
- Love you.- I
love you,too.-

83
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,770
- Again?
- Again?!

84
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:21,900
'Cause I have overcome  
more than words will ever say

85
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,820
and I've been given hope

86
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,110
that there's a light on up the hall

87
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,550
and that a day will come
when the fight is won

88
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:38,940
and I think that day has just begun

89
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:47,640
oh,oh,just begun   lift me up

90
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,860
ooh,yeah,yeah,yeah   yeah,yeah,oh

91
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,920
oh,oh,lift me up

92
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:02,510
lift me up,lift me up

93
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:07,620
I really hope that we get to
share all these things together.

94
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,190
But just in case,it's all right he.

95
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,370
Now,there is just one
thing... that I need from you.

96
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,190
Please...

97
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:31,050
take very special care of your
father... because if I'm not around...

98
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:38,630
he's gonna need you to take care
of him,just like my dad needed me.

99
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,950
So,love him... ...And
take care of him...

100
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,310
...And be kind to him.

101
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,410
Just please... ...Do that for me.

102
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,490
Peyton,what is this?

103
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,220
I just thought I should.

104
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,650
No. No,you... You said
everything was gonna be okay.

105
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,080
You said that.

106
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,070
Okay,but,luke,if it isn't,I want
our child to be able to remember me.

107
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,250
It's just in case.

108
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,470
Our child's not gonna
have to remember yoU.

109
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,850
Our child's gonna know you.

110
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,930
We're not doing this,peyton.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,110
Lucas.

112
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,680
A death video?

113
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,560
A sad box of stuff?

114
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,470
I'm not having any of this,peyton.

115
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,340
I mean,what's next?

116
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,220
I want to get married... noW.

117
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,400
Absolutely not.

118
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,880
You're supposed to be taking it easy.

119
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,020
Okay,look,after you have this
baby and you're all better,

120
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,720
then -- then
we'll get married.

121
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,450
I want to get married.

122
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,590
Why? Why is it so important to dit now?

123
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,690
- Because -- we're not doing
anything just in case,okay?

124
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,540
I'll be in the garage.

125
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,170
You should be in bed.

126
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,570
Thank you!

127
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,280
I love you,too,by the way.

128
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,770
Remind me again what we're doing here?

129
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,130
Know thy enemy,brooke.

130
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,170
Suit yourself,but this is our competitio and they're
cutting into our market share with these hideous things.

131
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,580
Yeah,the appropriate
word being "hideous.

132
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,920
" Don't be so dismissive.

133
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,300
Maybe you should pay a visit to the
manufacturer,get some inspiration.

134
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,770
I have sam,and sam has
school,so I'm not going anywhere.

135
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,770
Besides,I need to be here while
she's meeting with... you know who.

136
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,150
You mean the biological mother with
the pathetically low credit score?

137
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,290
What are you talking about?

138
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,370
So,I had business affairs
run her credit report.

139
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,660
Don't hate me because I'm resourceful.

140
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,960
You did what?

141
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,240
Brooke,we have to be able to
make a case against the woman.

142
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,680
We are not building
a case against anyone.

143
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,390
Do you think that I can't
see what you're doing?

144
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,010
There is no running from this.

145
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,070
Sam has every right
to know her...real mom.

146
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,870
Suit yourself.

147
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,500
Red is really your color.

148
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,350
What do you think?

149
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,730
Do you think we're shopping right now?

150
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,850
Absolutely not.

151
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,730
This is strictly r&d for our new line.

152
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,900
You are so trying to shop with me!

153
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,750
Uncle lucas,can I help
you fix aunt peyton's car?

154
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,910
Hey,sure,buddy.

155
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,550
Careful.

156
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,210
sure this is no problem,him
hanging out with you?

157
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,930
Yeah,I could use the company anyway.

158
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,590
Everything okay?

159
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,640
It's peyton.

160
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,330
I-I-I found her putting together a time
capsule,or a -- a "just in case" capsule.

161
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,410
- That's what i thought.
- I know,yeah.

162
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,590
It's just,you know,weird that I'm approaching
what's supposed to be the most exciting moment

163
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:37,100
of my entire life with nothing
but... complete and utter fear.

164
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,100
You want to hear a secret?

165
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,810
Day jamie was born,I was...petrified.

166
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,480
No,you know,it's
different,though,you know?

167
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,380
I mean,what if something
happens to peyton?

168
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,030
I don't know how we got this far.

169
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,250
Well,you got this far
'cause it's what she wanted.

170
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,740
You know?It's like when karen let
you play basketball with your hcm.

171
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,450
She knew how bad you wanted it,so she
just held her breath and let you play.

172
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,760
We all did,you know?

173
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,480
Maybe -- maybe this is the time you
have to hold your breath for peyton.

174
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,480
She wants to get married.

175
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,850
So do you.

176
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,580
You proposed,remember?

177
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,150
She wants to geted arriright away.

178
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,370
It all just worries me.

179
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,650
Well,as worried as you are,think
about how scared she is.

180
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:33,240
Look,if you had one more day to spend with peyton,would
you rather spend it arguing or just being married?

181
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,910
You ready?

182
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,600
For what?

183
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,730
Peyton's baby shower.You
didn't forget,did you?

184
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,690
Sure she wants me there?

185
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,740
Of course I'm sure.

186
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,310
The invitation was addressed
to both of us,you knucklehead.

187
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,180
Yeah.

188
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,040
Are you okay,sam?

189
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,110
ye,I'm good.

190
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,320
Okay.

191
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,090
So,everything's going
okay with,you know...

192
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,890
my mom?

193
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,730
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

194
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,610
what do you got there?

195
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,530
it's her house.

196
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,560
you know,she gave me
up when she was my age.

197
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,880
How weird is that?

198
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,580
Yeah.

199
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,140
she said she didn't want to,but
her parents made her do it.

200
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,580
well,I can relate to having crummy
parents who make bad decisions.

201
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,330
Yeah.

202
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,990
You know,it's funny.I've always...

203
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,060
wanted to live in a house
with a white picket fence.

204
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,530
Well,we can have a
picket fence if you want.

205
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,400
You can have  any
kind of fence you want.

206
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,280
I'll just wait for you to get dressed.

207
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,670
You know,if it's okay,can
I just meet you there?

208
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,480
Yeah.

209
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,600
I'll see you at peyton'S.

210
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,060
Mouth: So,the stage is set
for the charleston chiefs,

211
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,200
who can move into sole possession
of first place with a win tonight.

212
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,670
And with the season coming to a close and
possible nba call-ups hanging in the balance,

213
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,220
coach bobby irons will be looking for explosive
performances from his two leading scorers,

214
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,270
nino jones and point guard nathan scott.

215
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,840
I can't believe anybody out
there would want your autograph.

216
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,170
A t re than would want it from you.

217
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,470
Look,just 'cause you're the starting point
guard don't mean you can show up late.

218
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,320
I had you going for a second.

219
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,180
And don't worry.I covered for you,man.

220
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:16,480
Well,well,you guys go on an eight-game winning
streak,and suddenly it's a love fest in here.

221
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,010
I wouldn't go that far.

222
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,390
I'll tell you
what,scott --

223
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,610
I'll waive your fine for being late if you and
your new best friend here can do two things.

224
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,440
And what's that?

225
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,670
Win the game tonight... and impress the
nba scout who's here to watch you guys play.

226
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,360
Scout?

227
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,220
Word is the clippers are
looking for some backcourt help.

228
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,970
All right,then. Yeah.

229
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,540
- Good luck,guys.
- Thanks.

230
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,350
Hey,uh,scott,I think you
might want to sit this one out.

231
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,280
I'm so not wearing this.

232
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,240
Sam,it's a baby shower.

233
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,620
You can't show up like you just
walked out of a brazilian favela.

234
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,530
Okay,well,this makes me
look like kermit the frog.

235
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,880
Okay.

236
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,920
So,how goes it with... the waitress?

237
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,840
Her name is rebecca,thank you.

238
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,970
And for your information,things
are kind of going okay.

239
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,010
Yes,well... I'm sure your
conversations are just riveting.

240
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:26,520
I mean,you have so much to talk about,what
with 16 years of pure neglect to hash over.

241
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,720
Don't be mean.

242
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,260
Sorry. It's just that she left you.

243
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,090
So,you know... it's not like that.

244
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,770
I mean... I thought that way at first.

245
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:42,480
I thought she'd be this evil person,you know,this
bad person that gave me up,but she's not.

246
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:46,680
You know,she's got her
problems,but she's okay.

247
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,750
I mean,in a way,she's
-- she's kind of like...

248
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,950
like what?

249
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,680
Like me.

250
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,020
Did she say she wanted you back?

251
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,260
Doesn't matter.I'm happy here.

252
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,770
And that's what we want for
you,samantha -- to be happy here.

253
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,740
Yeah,I know.It's just,I don't
want to hurt brooke's feelings,

254
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,730
but part of me wants to know her,u know?

255
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,560
My real mom?

256
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,260
Do you want to live with her?

257
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,230
No.

258
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,560
of course you don'T.

259
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,360
That's my girl.

260
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:39,250
Now let's see if we can't find a beautiful
dress for you,worthy of the davis name.

261
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,420
Oh,man.Hey,man,don't you
guys got somewhere else to be?

262
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,230
Dude,I am killing this game right now.

263
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,270
Yeah,well,I got a date with lauren.

264
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,790
So y'all gonna have to be getting
y'all asses up out of here.

265
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,460
Hey,isn't this like the third date?

266
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,990
You know what that means.

267
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,440
Yeah.That's jamie's teacher
you're talking about.

268
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,870
This from the guy who
dropped down granny deb.

269
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:11,540
Look,it's a date,man
-- nice,classy,refined.

270
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,530
But just in case,you two be gone
by the time I get home,a'ight?

271
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,890
Okay,it's official.

272
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,850
I look like a lemon-meringue pie.

273
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,520
Shut up.You have that
whole glow thing going.

274
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,060
If by "glowing" you mean
"growing," then maybe.

275
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,960
I really to lovehe dress,brooke.

276
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,450
It was a great gift.

277
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,140
Thanks.

278
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,180
Although i am just stuck in the house.

279
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,030
Well,then you'll be stuck in the
house for a month looking fabulous.

280
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,480
It was sam's idea.

281
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,640
Oh,clearly she's learning from the best.

282
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,620
Where is she,anyway?I
thought she was coming.

283
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:51,990
She'll be here.

284
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,050
You're doing an amazing
job with her,brooke davis.

285
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,490
Hey,she loves you.

286
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:05,510
Well,let's hope so... 'cause I'm
thinking of making it official.

287
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,520
I'm thinking of adopting her.

288
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,050
- No.
- Yeah.

289
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,330
I just got all the papers in the mail.

290
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,410
Oh,my god,that is such good news.

291
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,810
Come here. Sit down. Tell me everything.

292
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:20,010
All right,um -- well,I mean,how's
it going with her birth mother?

293
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,210
It seems like it's going okay.

294
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,780
I'm just trying to be supportive.

295
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,660
What if sam likes her better than me?

296
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,460
Okay,take it from
someone who was adopted.

297
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,860
I happen to know that sam just became
the luckiest girl in the whole world.

298
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,610
Thank you,P.Sawyer.

299
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,430
You always me everything better for me.

300
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,970
Don'T. Don'T.

301
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,910
We are not gonna ruin today crying.

302
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:58,430
You're gonna get out of that dress and clean yourself
up because we have a party to go to out there.

303
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,020
Come on.

304
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,120
there's an ipod in here.

305
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,210
awesome!

306
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,190
This is the night you and daddy
won the state championship.

307
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,930
Do youernow whe you were that night?

308
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,910
In mom's tummy.

309
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,970
That's right.

310
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,250
So,mom and dad didn't even know me then.

311
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,130
Well,none of us did,but we were
all really excited to meet you.

312
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,070
Hey,look!

313
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,620
********

314
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,500
Now,that was a really important night.

315
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,720
Because you won the state championship?

316
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:48,470
Yeah,but,um... it was also the night
I realized I wanted to marry peyton.

317
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,280
This is cool.

318
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,210
What else is in here?

319
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,290
Yeah,what is in there?

320
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,280
Hey,nathan,I got a question for you.

321
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,050
Yes,we're gonna win tonight.

322
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,210
Okay,but,uh... how are you dealing
with this long-distance thing?

323
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,660
- It's killing me.
- Yeah.Me,too.

324
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,130
And if you figure that
one out,let me know.

325
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,420
Hey,you see that guy
overhere talking to bobby?

326
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,460
He's an nba scout.

327
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,570
Good luck tonight,nate.

328
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,240
Luck has nothing to do with it.

329
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,830
Peyton: Look at all of these presents!

330
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,050
All right,I'm gonna open the first one.

331
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,160
It's from mia.What did you get me?

332
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:41,680
You got me... ...pictures of you.

333
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:48,150
Okay,yeah,but the gift  is that you get to pick
the one that goes on the cover of our new record.

334
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,720
Good save.

335
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,380
All right,what do we got?What do we got?

336
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,830
I want to see.I want to see.

337
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:57,420
Um,sexy.Pretty!

338
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,780
Ooh,pretty and sexy.

339
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,350
Mm,girls,I think we found a winner.

340
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,610
Yay!

341
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:10,530
Wow,I -- I guess this means the
record's nearly finished,huh?

342
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,510
Speaking of "wow"...  !

343
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,240
Antwon..

344
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:29,810
You ready?

345
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,680
Uh,we have a slight problem.

346
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,030
Hey,coach skills!

347
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,000
- What the
-- chuck?

348
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,820
His mom had an emergency,and she
couldn't pick him up from school.***

349
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,280
So,I promised I'd watch
him for a little while.

350
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,740
I'm so sorry.

351
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,820
I guess we should probably cancel?

352
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,920
NaH.

353
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:53,800
I mean,I...guess he could come.

354
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,850
You wouldn't mind?

355
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,060
Yeah.

356
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,440
Why not?

357
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,540
Great.

358
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,580
I'll get my coat.

359
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:05,040
Sweet!Where we going?

360
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,990
Yeah,so,peewee basketball is
just how I give back to the kids.

361
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,200
But you would be surprised at how
profitable the baby-proofing industry is.

362
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,930
Yo,chuck!

363
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,510
Sorry!

364
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,240
Yeah,he's doing well.

365
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,110
He don't look too bad.

366
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,070
You know,you don't know how few guys
would be up for a night like this.

367
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,060
I'm so glad we didn't cancel,antwon.

368
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,060
Really?

369
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,540
How glad?

370
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,720
Come on!

371
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,460
Whose freaking kid is this?Damn it!

372
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,510
Uh,mine!Sorry!

373
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,200
I'll be back.

374
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:04,020
That's the end of the first
half,chiefs leading by 10,

375
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:07,020
Hey,it's mama as a cheerleader.

376
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,570
Yeah,and there's,uh,aunt
brooke and aunt peyton.

377
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,630
They've been friends for a long time.

378
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,710
Oh,yeah,a long time.

379
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,550
Who's in that one?

380
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,480
Let's see.

381
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,520
That's uncle keith,aunt
karen,and who's that?

382
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,950
That's me.

383
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,430
You were a funny-looking
baby,uncle lucas.

384
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,690
Just kidding.

385
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,770
You're kind of my
uncle keith,aren't you?

386
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,360
Well,I'd like to think
that's exactly who I am.

387
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,940
Aunt peyton's a cool angel.

388
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,630
is aunt peyton gonna be okay?

389
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,300
I don't know,bud.

390
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,850
I think everything's gonna be okay.

391
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,560
oh,wow,what is it?

392
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,430
It's a baby memory book,and you put photos
and journal entries and all that stuff in it.

393
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,760
When you look at it five years from
now,you'll never believe they were that small.

394
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,630
you know,victoria almost
got one of those for me.

395
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,850
peyton.

396
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,250
yeah.

397
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,440
You okay?

398
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,200
I love it.Thank you.

399
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:56,580
AnD... I just want you guys
to know... I love you so much.

400
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,440
I love you,too.

401
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,260
Okay,hold oN.

402
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,980
I'm taking a picture --
no crying for the picture.

403
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,710
Yeah?

404
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,030
Okay. Okay? Get in here.

405
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:12,990
Ready? One,two,three.

406
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,250
All right,let's bring it in.

407
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,290
It's "chiefs" on
three.One,two,three.Chiefs!

408
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,430
Let's go.Let's go,dawg. Bring it home.

409
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,670
Nate.

410
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,260
So far,you've done a terrific
job making nino look good.

411
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,360
Just make sure you make
yourself  look good,too,okay?

412
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,660
If you get an open shot,take it.

413
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,100
The scouts are here to watch everyone.

414
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,060
And th includes you,coach.

415
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,610
We're gonna win this game.

416
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,460
I'm not angry.

417
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:03,130
But I would appreciate you talking to me first
before you start lavishing sam with fancy clothes.

418
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,510
I thought she looked nice.

419
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,020
Not the point.

420
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,010
What are you doing here?

421
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,890
I wanted to talk to you about sam.

422
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,620
What about sam?

423
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:15,480
I know you care for her deeply,as do I.

424
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:21,960
But I think that you should consider letting her spend
time with her birth mother on a more permanent basis.

425
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,050
And what makes you think that?

426
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,500
Honey,I've been talking to her.

427
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,430
Don't "honey" me.

428
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,100
You talked to her about this?

429
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,690
This is not your
business!You had no right!

430
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:37,820
I should have known that nothing good was gonna
come of the two of you spending time together.

431
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:40,040
What can I say?We get along.

432
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,440
Unlike some people that
shall remain nameless.

433
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,810
You can't do this.

434
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,870
Do what?

435
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,000
Try to be the mother to her
that you never were to me.

436
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,260
- Last time I checked,i was
still your -- don't say it.

437
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:55,190
Anyone who ever wanted to
be in my life -- peyton,boys,

438
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,080
anyone -- you tried
to push them all away.

439
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:02,050
You tried to push  everyone
away,and nowyou want sam to leave?

440
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,690
I don't want sam to leave.

441
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,730
Yes,you do!It's why you're
lying to my face right now!

442
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,010
You're jealous because
she wants to be with me.

443
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:13,070
Well,she's not going anywhere..

444
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,770
...not if I hainnythg to say about it.

445
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,790
What's that?

446
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,530
Adoption papers.

447
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:24,320
Brooke...be careful.

448
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,090
I don't want you to get hurt.

449
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:29,070
All my life,you have
avoided being a mother to me.

450
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:33,710
Do not think for one moment
that you get to start now.

451
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,070
What's going on?

452
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,820
I don't know.

453
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,800
Maybe you should ask your mother.

454
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,800
What was that about?

455
00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:01,670
Sam,I want to talk to you about
something -- something...important.

456
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,380
You're happy here,right?

457
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,240
Yeah.What's going on?

458
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,600
I want to adopt
you -- for real.

459
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,060
I want to make it official and forever.

460
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,810
I've given this a lot of thought.

461
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,680
I want us to be a family.

462
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,630
I know that it's your dream to have
that,and I want to give that to you now.

463
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,100
So,what do you say?

464
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,710
Yeah. Yeah.

465
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,800
Okay.

466
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,960
What?

467
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,560
I can still see my real mom,right?

468
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,170
dude,save some for the second half.

469
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:02,350
So,you know,you never really
talk about your past relationship.

470
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,080
Was it a bad break-up?

471
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,300
Yeah,kind of.

472
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,910
I mean,in the end,it was
mostly a lifestyle thing.

473
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,230
We just didn't see eye
to eye on some stuff.

474
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,980
She was a grandma.

475
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,750
Let's just say she was mature.

476
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,520
Hey,look,that's cool.

477
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,740
It's just,um -- so we're
clear,I prefer younger guys --

478
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:26,350
younger,bald,athletic
guys who like kids.

479
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,690
Yeah,well,you know,that's funny,because
my last relationship didn't work

480
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:33,120
because I was too young,bald,athletic.

481
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,260
But i do like kids.

482
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,430
Mom says I shouldn't eat dairy.

483
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,850
Some kids.

484
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,520
I do like some kids.

485
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,540
Oh,no.

486
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,320
All right,jim-jam,come
on,buddy.We got to go.

487
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,620
Do i have to?

488
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,900
YeS.Chop-chop.

489
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,360
If we hurry,we can call
your dad before your bedtime.

490
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,620
This isu hat yoguys
have been working on?

491
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,740
Don't tell.

492
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,550
It's a surprise for aunt peyton.

493
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,050
Sorry.

494
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,140
So,uh,how was the shower?Is she okay?

495
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,910
Yeah.Yeah,I think she
really enjoyed herself.

496
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,430
How are you doing?You holding up okay?

497
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,740
Better now.

498
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,820
Good.Glad to hear it.

499
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:08,390
All right,buddylet's go call your dad.

500
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,760
Thanks,uncle lucas.That was fun.

501
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,420
Yeah,it was.

502
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,240
Your whole life's in that box.

503
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,480
I wish i had one.

504
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,640
- See ya.
- ByE.

505
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,370
He's cute.

506
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,840
And you are sweet.

507
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:45,370
Look,I know it wasn't the night you
planned,but you were really great with chuck.

508
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,330
Yeah.

509
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:50,570
Well,maybe next time it
could just be the two of us.

510
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:51,670
I'd like that.

511
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,220
- Yeah?
- YeS.

512
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,800
Naughty,naughty.

513
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,860
I'll take his silly butt home.

514
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,010
- Oh,good night,guys.
- Good night.

515
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,090
She's cool.You should ask
her out sometime,coach.

516
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,270
Oh,god.

517
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,970
Can I talk to you?

518
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,080
Listen,I didn't mean
to ambush you...before.

519
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,270
That wasn't right.

520
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,460
It's okay.

521
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,670
I don't think it is.

522
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,770
Sam,I've actually been thinking about this,and I
think you should go spend some time with your real mom.

523
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,270
You want to,don't you?

524
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,680
Please don't hate me.

525
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,100
Samantha,I could never hate you.

526
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,310
I love you very much.

527
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,670
But you stayed fore.

528
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:28,080
You... You let go of julian for me.

529
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,660
Honey,I was doing what was best for you.

530
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:36,600
And that was true then,and...
I think it's true now.

531
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,730
you should go.

532
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,860
You know you can always come back here.

533
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,700
How come you're so good to me?

534
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:52,080
Because I love you,no matter what.

535
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:00,710
can I keep the dress?

536
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,760
Of course.

537
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:10,310
It's just,uh... victoria says I
look like a davis in that dress.

538
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,370
Honey,you'll always be a davis to me.

539
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,000
You'll always be my first mom.

540
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,550
Okay.

541
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,970
How about that nathan scott?

542
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,890
Played a pretty great game tonight.

543
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,410
Honestly,I've never really
seen him as a point guard.

544
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,650
But I got to say,I was impressed.

545
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,630
Kid's got a bright future.

546
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,750
With the clippers?

547
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:57,250
Hey,what happened?

548
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,340
- I thought you
were -- don't say it.

549
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,000
You know that annoying
kid from my peewee team?

550
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,500
Yeah,the hoser kid?

551
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,110
Yeah.

552
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,680
Let's just say I got chucked.

553
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,290
Damn.

554
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:17,310
Hey,I just,uh,realized
you forgot something.

555
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,830
This.

556
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,300
I'm gonna miss you.

557
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,130
I'll miss you,too.

558
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:36,480
You know,you always have
a home here,no matter what.

559
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,360
I love you,sam.

560
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,440
I love you,too.

561
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,900
Samantha.

562
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,940
- Bye.
- ByE.

563
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,930
Okay.Bye.

564
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,180
Are you crying?

565
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:35,350
No.It's this horrible mascara.

566
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,130
It's just -- remind me
to sue the manufacturer.

567
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,490
It's our mascara,victoria.

568
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,160
What do we do now?

569
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,190
We have our work to focus on.

570
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,590
of course.

571
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:03,080
hey,coach.

572
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,510
Have you heard anything from thecout?

573
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,870
Uh,no.No,not yet.

574
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:11,250
But listen,you guys did
all you could out there.

575
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,960
And now we just wait
for the phone to ring.

576
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:40,550
'cause all you talk about

577
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:48,890
is to see yourself break out

578
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:57,530
I've seen you this way before

579
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:04,660
life's strange but true

580
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,580
what are we waiting for?

581
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:19,440
It's been long time,nothing new

582
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,870
something survived here

583
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:38,030
you've been working overtime

584
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:44,240
how's it feel to lie?

585
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,220
It's going to be okay,honey.

586
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,060
I'm fine.

587
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,770
We have our work to focus on now.

588
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:08,170
Life's strange but true

589
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:15,820
What are we waiting for?

590
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:22,650
It's been a long time,nothing new

591
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:31,470
for a while   we were living

592
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:39,280
it's the pace   That'll kill you

593
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,640
kill you

594
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,060
there's still one thing missing.

595
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,950
What's that?

596
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,630
Our wedding photo.

597
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,890
Really?

598
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,780
- We can get married right away?
- Sure.

599
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:05,470
Only if the doctor says it's okay.

600
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:13,790
But it's not because of the baby or
our situation or... well,any damn thing.

601
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:19,120
I want you to be my
wife... 'cause I love you.

602
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,630
I love you with all my heart.

603
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,580
I love you,too.

604
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,830
I'm here
