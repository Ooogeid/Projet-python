1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:02,126
Millie was right.

2
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:04,184
Alex dupré is the perfect choice

3
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:06,151
To be the face of the new campaig

4
00:00:06,234 --> 00:00:08,484
Alex, millicent huxtable,
clothes over bros.

5
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:09,717
Welcome tree hill.

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,018
Thank you.

7
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:14,084
I want you to move
your stuff in, okay ?

8
00:00:14,167 --> 00:00:16,084
<i>This is our house now,
not just mine.</i>

9
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:19,251
Quinn, what actually happened
between you and david ?

10
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:22,084
He used to s the world
exactly the way i saw it.

11
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:24,051
He just doesn't anymore.

12
00:00:24,134 --> 00:00:27,001
Ladies and gentlemen,
my wife and the love of my life.

13
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:35,285
That night after your big game
against memphis,

14
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,751
We had that party.

15
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:40,151
We were pretty wasted that night.

16
00:00:40,234 --> 00:00:41,684
Yeah. So ?

17
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:44,734
Well, that was three months ago.

18
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,884
She's three months pregnant, nate.

19
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,751
What do you want from me ?
Huh ?

20
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:55,651
Hi, nathan.

21
00:00:55,734 --> 00:00:57,184
<i>You need to stop this now,
okay ? Do you hear me ?</i>

22
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:59,318
Why are you doing this me ?

23
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:01,533
Cl : come on.

Caions paid for by
warner bros. Television

26
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:29,751
Brooke, i'm shaving.

27
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:32,567
Got to go. I'm late. I have
a big day. I love you. B.

28
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:06,067
I'm gonna kill you, mout

29
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,318
Alex ?

30
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:15,417
Oh, well, at least she's awake.

31
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,651
Alex, come on !
We got to go !

32
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:20,118
Oh, my god.

33
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:22,218
Keep it down.

34
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:24,450
I'm so tired.

35
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:26,951
Millicent : you've been out all night ?
I have to sleep.

36
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:29,184
T the shower.

37
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:31,884
I leave it on.
I like the sound of the rain.

38
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:33,851
Now i have to sleep.
Go away.

39
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:37,285
<i>No, no. Alex, you have
a photo shoot in, like, now.</i>

40
00:02:37,368 --> 00:02:38,784
You have to get up.

41
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,351
I can't hear you.

42
00:02:40,434 --> 00:02:43,018
I'm asleep.

43
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:45,018
Oh, there's a sheep.

44
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:46,967
Hello, counting sheep.

45
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:50,484
You're funny.

46
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:52,751
Well, there goes your counting sheep

47
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:54,684
With your half-million dollars.

48
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:56,034
Bye.

49
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,734
Can i just say that i hate you ?
Mm-hmm.

50
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:08,018
Oh, it's cold !

51
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:10,684
You shouldn't ve left it on,
you jerk.

52
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:12,717
Man, that guy's such a jerk.

53
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,918
You don't do that to no brother.

54
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:15,918
No.

55
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:17,517
Nah, you want to strip down

56
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,484
And parade your little flaccid
business around the apartment,

57
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,651
That's cool.

58
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:24,118
Go ahead with your naked ass.

59
00:03:24,201 --> 00:03:27,351
But this time,
you done went too far.

60
00:03:27,434 --> 00:03:31,500
It's cheap, it's mean,
and it's crossing the line.

61
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:46,218
Okay, time to man up.

62
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:49,218
Emergency situation.
Life or death.

63
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:51,118
What do you do ?

64
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:52,951
What do you do ?

65
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:56,684
Who do you call ?

66
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:58,667
Mm-hmm.

67
00:04:01,134 --> 00:04:04,334
Hey, yo, jamie scott.
I need your help.

68
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,285
Mcfadden.

69
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,751
You're friends
with nathan scott, aren't you ?

70
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:14,151
Yeah, old friends.
Why ?

71
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:15,984
Anything going on with him ?

72
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:17,385
He's in a contract year.

73
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:18,717
Right. Whatever.

74
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,617
A friend of mine was
having lunch yesterday.

75
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,717
He said he had some sort
of a misunderstanding

76
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,984
With a woman in a restaurant.

77
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:25,318
Okay.

78
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:26,784
It might be newsworthy.

79
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,633
You're kidding, righ

80
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:32,717
Well, i haa disagreement
yesterday at lunch with jerry

81
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,118
Over who got the last slice
of key lime pie.

82
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:36,851
It's not exactly news.

83
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:39,218
<i>And you're not exactly newsworthy.</i>

84
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:41,800
<i>He is.
Check it out.</i>

85
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,018
Mouth, if there's nothing there,
there's nothing there.

86
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:51,301
But i fired you'd want
to be the one to find out.

87
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:06,633
You know i didn't
do anything, right ?

88
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:12,151
I did not sleep with her
or do anything else.

89
00:05:12,234 --> 00:05:14,001
You have your arm around her.

90
00:05:16,034 --> 00:05:18,651
I get asked to take
a lot of pictures.

91
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:20,684
You have your arm around her
at a party

92
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,984
With a beer and a smile.

93
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:25,450
Haley -- i get it, nathan.

94
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,918
You got married in high school,

95
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:28,118
And you had a son at graduation,

96
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:29,351
And yodidn't have time

97
00:05:29,434 --> 00:05:30,984
To go out and party
with your friends

98
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:34,151
And... drunken sluts
with perfect teeth.

99
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,918
I just took a picture with her.
That's all.

100
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:38,867
<i>But it looks bad, nathan.</i>

101
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:42,918
And she's smart enough to know that.

102
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:45,401
You should be, too.

103
00:05:47,334 --> 00:05:50,267
Dan : what they see
is who you'll be.

104
00:05:52,867 --> 00:05:54,717
Entertainment is news.

105
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,951
Gossip is news.

106
00:05:57,034 --> 00:05:59,051
Rumor is news.

107
00:05:59,134 --> 00:06:00,617
And the truth --

108
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,151
Well... that'negotiable.

109
00:06:04,234 --> 00:06:05,368
Or is it ?

110
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,201
You see,
i say the truth is absolute.

111
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:14,385
I say the truth is not afraid.

112
00:06:14,468 --> 00:06:16,118
And the truth is --

113
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:18,550
You're a murderer ! A murderer --
that's what you are !

114
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:20,951
Go ahead ! Tell them the truth,
dan ! Tell them what you are !

115
00:06:21,034 --> 00:06:22,817
You're a murderer, is what you are !

116
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,318
How do you sleep at night ?!

117
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:26,051
How do you look at yourself
in the mirror ?!

118
00:06:26,134 --> 00:06:29,318
Murderer ! Murderer !
Murderer !

119
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:32,751
Man : should we cut ? Mrs. Scott ?
Rachel, should we cut ?

120
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:35,584
No. Keep rolling.

121
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:38,118
But the guy called him a murderer.

122
00:06:38,201 --> 00:06:39,817
Man #2 : he called the guy
a murderer.

123
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,851
So ?

124
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,301
He is one.

125
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,867
Hey, i'm so happy
we could make this work.

126
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:58,317
Haley's been showing me
a ton of your work,

127
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,517
And i am such a fan.

128
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,751
Thank you, brooke.

129
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:02,784
You know, i wear your designs
quite a bit,

130
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:05,117
And i really feel like
i can capture the energy

131
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,284
That you're after
with all the new designs.

132
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:09,484
Plus, i am so excited
to shoot alex dupré.

133
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,851
I mean, what is she like ?

134
00:07:10,934 --> 00:07:12,934
Wow. She's like...

135
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,150
That.

136
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:18,784
Alex, what happened to you ?

137
00:07:18,867 --> 00:07:20,085
Jet lag.

138
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:24,051
Jet lag, my foot.
You flew in from new york.

139
00:07:24,134 --> 00:07:25,884
Are you hung over ?

140
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:28,217
I-i just need my pills.

141
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,051
Excuse me ?
You just got out of rehab.

142
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:31,351
What is that ?

143
00:07:31,434 --> 00:07:33,101
What did you just take ?!

144
00:07:34,068 --> 00:07:35,150
Vitamins ?

145
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:36,384
No. No.
Give it.

146
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:38,184
Ew.

147
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:40,184
They're just vitamins, you hags.

148
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:43,434
Hags ?
Half a million dollars.

149
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,150
Sit.

150
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:51,551
You might want to start with
a little lying-slut remover.

151
00:07:51,634 --> 00:07:54,217
Millicent : this is
our rejuvenation cream.

152
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,551
It does wonders for jet lag,
but it smells a little bad.

153
00:07:57,634 --> 00:07:59,651
Whatever.
You know you farted.

154
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:01,517
I did not fart.

155
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,500
That's too bad,'cause i just did.

156
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,250
Tell me again
what this thing look like.

157
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,551
What's that magical thing called ?

158
00:08:16,634 --> 00:08:18,484
I think they call him puff.

159
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:19,851
The magic dragon ?

160
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:23,351
Yeah, that's exactly what
it looked like -- a dragon.

161
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:26,217
But it was like puff's evil twin.

162
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,934
Oh, man.

163
00:08:31,134 --> 00:08:33,034
Cool.

164
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:39,384
See, mouth knows i'm scared
of creatures, right ? Mm-hmm.

165
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:41,918
That's why i know
he did this on purpose.

166
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:43,684
You think you can catch it ?

167
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:45,451
<i>We can catch it.</i>

168
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:47,701
<i>You can catch it.</i>

169
00:08:49,734 --> 00:08:52,651
The new cameron crowe film, right ?

170
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:53,918
Perfect. Yeah.

171
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,317
Okay, thanks for letting me know.

172
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,051
Hi. Are you gonna work
on a cameron crowe movie ?

173
00:08:58,134 --> 00:09:01,085
No, that was the video store.
I'm just renting one. Oh.

174
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:02,517
I got coffees.

175
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,985
Mocha double latte, extra foam.
Thank you.

176
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:05,284
Mocha double latte, no foam.

177
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:06,451
Thank you.

178
00:09:06,534 --> 00:09:08,651
And coffee, black, two sugars.

179
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:09,884
I called haley.

180
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,751
Oh, thanks.
Julian.

181
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,985
Quinn. You made outn my bed. Hey !

182
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:16,068
Hey, so did you.

183
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:19,884
Sorry about that.

184
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:22,751
Hello.
Hot p. a. Boy.

185
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:24,184
Hi.

186
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:27,117
Oh, you must be alex.

187
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,718
You must be yummy.
What'd you get me ?

188
00:09:30,801 --> 00:09:33,784
You get chocolate,
perfect for alleged jet lag.

189
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:35,018
Word's on the street.

190
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:36,618
And the entertaient trades --

191
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,884
Barely read.

192
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:39,918
Mmm.

193
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:41,317
I like him.

194
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,551
Yeah, well, you got a little
competition on that one.

195
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:46,834
Please, you're way too old for him.

196
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,551
So...

197
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:05,684
200 grand and she signs
a confidentiality agreement.

198
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:08,918
She goes away, and you have
noing to do with the kid.

199
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:10,384
I already have nothing
to do with the kid.

200
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:12,284
It's not mine.

201
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:14,018
Why is she doing this to me ?

202
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:15,851
Because u make a lot of money,

203
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:17,651
And because you're in the middle

204
00:10:17,734 --> 00:10:19,684
Of a very public
contract negotiation

205
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:21,217
With a team that cares
about its image

206
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,551
And the only team
that you want to play for.

207
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:27,517
Which leads me to this.

208
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,417
Maybe we pay her.

209
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,351
Tell me you did not just say that.

210
00:10:31,434 --> 00:10:33,051
I did, because i'm your agent,

211
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:34,384
And i wouldn't be a very good one

212
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,951
If i didn't least
point out the fact

213
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:37,618
That she could do
a hell of a lot of damage

214
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:39,718
If she went public with this
or filed a paternity suit.

215
00:10:39,801 --> 00:10:41,417
It's not true.
I'll take a blood test.

216
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,284
And by that point,
the damage could be done.

217
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:45,051
Nate, your next contract
could be worth

218
00:10:45,134 --> 00:10:46,884
$18 million to $20 million minimum,

219
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:48,718
Not to mention the endorsement deals

220
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:51,818
That are predicated on the fac
that nathan scott is a good guy,

221
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,684
He's a good father,
and he's a family man.

222
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:55,851
She's lying.

223
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:57,018
So she's lying.

224
00:10:57,101 --> 00:10:58,451
You know the way it works, man.

225
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:00,351
They print the accusation
onhe front page

226
00:11:00,434 --> 00:11:01,784
And the retraction on t back.

227
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:04,233
If i pay her,
then i'm saying that i did it.

228
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,784
I disagree.

229
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:08,384
I think you're paying a little
for a lot, and that's all.

230
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,584
And all i'm saying is
that it's a valid option

231
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:15,417
We should at least consider
before she... goes public.

232
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,284
Great.
Here comes the press.

233
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,384
Hey, nate, clay.
Hey.

234
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:23,384
Nate, can i talk to you ?
About what ?

235
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:25,085
Clay.

236
00:11:25,168 --> 00:11:27,517
I'm cool.
I'll catch up with you. Nate...

237
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,351
I justant to talk
to an old friend, okay ?

238
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:32,168
Okay.

239
00:11:36,534 --> 00:11:38,085
How you doing ?

240
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:39,751
That depends.

241
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:41,784
Aryou here as a reporter
or as a friend ?

242
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,051
Well, it depends on what's going on.

243
00:11:44,134 --> 00:11:47,150
My station manager
had a friend in the restaurant

244
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:48,784
Where you had lunch yesterday --

245
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:50,451
Said you were upset about something.

246
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:52,751
Yeah.

247
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:55,317
Listen, if you need
someone to talk to,

248
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,667
I'm here as a friend, off the cord.

249
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:00,701
Off the record ?

250
00:12:04,101 --> 00:12:05,284
The's a girl who's threatening

251
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:06,651
To file a paternity suit against me

252
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:08,451
Unless i pay her a couple
hundred thousand dollars

253
00:12:08,534 --> 00:12:09,618
To keep her quiet.

254
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:11,951
Ez, nate.

255
00:12:12,034 --> 00:12:14,150
I'm sorry.

256
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,085
Yeah.

257
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,117
I didn't do it.

258
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,618
I don't even know her.

259
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:20,317
Good. I'm glad.

260
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,051
Does haley know ?

261
00:12:22,134 --> 00:12:23,517
Yeah.

262
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,117
What are you gonna do about it ?

263
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,400
I don't know.

264
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:29,734
<i>What are you gonna do about it ?</i>

265
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:34,051
Nothing.

266
00:12:34,134 --> 00:12:35,484
Look, i shou get back,

267
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,985
But you let me know
if you need anything, okay ?

268
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:40,267
Ye.

269
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,117
Mouth...

270
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,884
Thks.

271
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:50,417
But, lk, if this thing
turns into something --

272
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,417
She files a paternity suit,
whatever --

273
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,618
You do what you have to do.

274
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:58,367
I hope it doesn't come to that.

275
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:03,884
Yeah.

276
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:05,634
Me too.

277
00:13:12,434 --> 00:13:13,851
Okay, i'm good.

278
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:15,767
Why don't you two step in
for a couple of test shots ?

279
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:17,734
Sure.
Come pose with me.

280
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,534
Hold it.

281
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:30,951
He is so cute.

282
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:32,384
With big hands.

283
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:35,517
He probably has a rely big thingy.

284
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,250
You do know that's
brooke's boyfriend, yes ?

285
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,250
As in "serious boyfriend."

286
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,484
She dates a p. a.?

287
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:41,767
He's not a p. a.
He's a producer.

288
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:45,150
Yeah, she dates the p. a.

289
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:47,217
No, you said he's a producer.

290
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,818
Mnh-mnh.

291
00:13:48,901 --> 00:13:51,384
As in movie producer.
No, i didn't.

292
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:52,551
Julian.

293
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:54,184
Juan.

294
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,217
Oh, my god, he's julian baker.

295
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,250
I heard that they were dating.

296
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,985
Damn.

297
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:01,384
Okay, she's ready.

298
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,417
How do i look ?
Oh, fabulous.

299
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,351
I didn't ask the help.
How do i look, millie ?

300
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:07,784
You want my opinion ?
Of course.

301
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:10,217
You're the only one who tells me
the frickin'truth around here.

302
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,684
You look amazing.

303
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:14,801
I know.

304
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,384
I'm such a slut.

305
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:18,818
All right, bitches.

306
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:21,818
Let's do this.

307
00:14:21,901 --> 00:14:23,351
I hate her.

308
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:24,634
Yeah.

309
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:11,184
Let's talk about today's disruption.

310
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:13,517
That man wasn't wrong.

311
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,284
We were talking about the truth,

312
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:18,851
And what he said... was true.

313
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:20,834
I am a murderer.

314
00:15:24,101 --> 00:15:27,085
But i won't hide from that.

315
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:29,467
<i>I can't hide from that.</i>

316
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:33,784
I step...

317
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:37,417
Into the harsh light...

318
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,985
Of the truth.

319
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:43,317
Because when you stand
in the light...

320
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,184
Audience : you get yourself right.

321
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:47,250
You find forgiveness.

322
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,584
You find happiness.

323
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:54,184
You find le.

324
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:56,751
I found love.

325
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:59,184
You all remember my producer, chel,

326
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:01,200
O also happens to be my wife.

327
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:11,784
I remember the night we met.

328
00:16:11,867 --> 00:16:14,818
It was so romantic.

329
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:17,434
Incredibly romantic.

330
00:16:26,701 --> 00:16:28,217
Dan scott ?

331
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,484
Nice ass.

332
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:32,967
Our courtship was old-fashioned...

333
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:35,784
Whew !

334
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:38,117
... chaste.

335
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,818
T bad for a guy with a bad heart.

336
00:16:39,901 --> 00:16:42,250
Well, spend the night, and
we'll see if you can kill me.

337
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,417
It'll cost you...

338
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,517
A lot.

339
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,918
It's okay.

340
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:47,751
I'm rich, and i'm dying.

341
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:50,400
Rks for me.

342
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:54,951
He had all of the things
i was interested in.

343
00:16:55,034 --> 00:16:56,967
So did you, sweetheart.

344
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,584
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, man.

345
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:10,051
You sure you don't want
to use the net or something ?

346
00:17:10,134 --> 00:17:11,751
That thing is terrible.

347
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:13,284
I think i'll be okay.

348
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:16,018
So, how come mouth
wants you to move out ?

349
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,317
It's just that he want this place

350
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,517
All to hisself with millie.

351
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,117
You can move into miss lauren's.

352
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,884
Yeah, i -- wait, listen, man.

353
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:23,918
Now, we gonna catch
this thing or what ?

354
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,784
I'm not so sure anymore.

355
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:27,884
I might need a little convincing.

356
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:29,684
Forget it.
Okay.

357
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:31,651
I guess it'll just have
to stay in the bathtub.

358
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:33,384
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

359
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:35,618
Okay, okay.

360
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:37,551
Uh, here's 10 bucks.

361
00:17:37,634 --> 00:17:39,985
Which is just enough
to catch a mouse

362
00:17:40,068 --> 00:17:42,034
Or maybe a guinea pig.

363
00:17:45,134 --> 00:17:47,618
<i>Now, that's dragon money.</i>

364
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:49,517
Okay, wait here.
Okay.

365
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,967
Wait, hold on.
Be careful.

366
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:55,534
Look out !

367
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,534
I named him percy.

368
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:10,085
You're doing great, alex.
Do you need anything ?

369
00:18:10,168 --> 00:18:12,734
Just some more water, please.
Thank you.

370
00:18:24,534 --> 00:18:26,217
You're looking at that thing

371
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,250
Like there's a ghost calling you.

372
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,951
There is.

373
00:18:30,034 --> 00:18:32,584
Husband troubles.

374
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:34,018
I'm sorry.

375
00:18:34,101 --> 00:18:35,384
Yeah, me too.

376
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:38,684
You know, you and julian
seem so happy.

377
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:40,985
Mm, we are.

378
00:18:41,068 --> 00:18:42,918
But i think he's bored
out of his mind.

379
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:44,818
He just gave up a movie
to be with me.

380
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:46,618
And i'm sure he's glad that he did.

381
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:48,985
You know, in our case,
i think part of the problem

382
00:18:49,068 --> 00:18:51,051
Was knowing what to give up
for each other

383
00:18:51,134 --> 00:18:52,734
And what to hold onto for ourselves.

384
00:18:57,434 --> 00:18:59,701
Yeah.

385
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,818
Hi.

386
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:11,584
Hi.

387
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:13,901
I'm sorry.

388
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:17,584
I know.

389
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:20,751
I just wish there was a way
to make all this go away.

390
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:22,367
There is.

391
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,718
You want to pay her ?!

392
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:27,985
You know full well this lying
whore didn't sleep with nathan,

393
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:29,651
And you want to pay her $200,000 ?!

394
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:30,918
<i>Whoa, i don't want to.</i>

395
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:32,951
I simply suggest
that it was an option.

396
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:35,085
It's not an option, clay.

397
00:19:35,168 --> 00:19:36,618
And while we're suggesting things,

398
00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:38,551
Let me suggest
that you are a he reason

399
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:40,284
Why this is happening right now. Ok.

400
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:42,085
You love it --
the parties, the women --

401
00:19:42,168 --> 00:19:44,884
And you love having nathan alongside
you more than anything else.

402
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:46,551
That's not fair.
No ?

403
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:48,818
The picture -- the one of that woman

404
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:50,784
Draped all over my husband --

405
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:52,551
What party was that at,lay ?

406
00:19:52,634 --> 00:19:54,184
Who threw that party ?

407
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:57,451
I'm not saying you don't
love him,'cause i know you do,

408
00:19:57,534 --> 00:20:00,918
But you love having him at your
side more than anything else.

409
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:03,351
You could have protected him
from ts.

410
00:20:03,434 --> 00:20:05,384
How, haley ?
He's a grown man.

411
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:07,250
So are you.

412
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,867
Start acting like it.

413
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:21,351
I don't think it's very fair --

414
00:20:21,434 --> 00:20:24,117
That mouth wants you
to move out, i mean.

415
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,451
Man, how could you even
look at that thing ?

416
00:20:26,534 --> 00:20:27,718
Ugh !

417
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:28,884
It's cool.

418
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:31,651
's gross.
That's what it is.

419
00:20:31,734 --> 00:20:33,384
You sure it ain't gonna get out ?

420
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:34,551
I'm sure.

421
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:35,933
All right.

422
00:20:37,634 --> 00:20:40,484
Anyway, thanks for
seeing things my way, man.

423
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:42,117
Good looking out, bro.

424
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,584
I just think it's your place, too.

425
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:46,451
<i>That's what i'm ying.</i>

426
00:20:46,534 --> 00:20:48,084
Well, what did he say ?

427
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:50,051
What ?

428
00:20:50,134 --> 00:20:52,567
When you told him this was your
place, too, what did he say ?

429
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:56,884
Oh, well, i didn't exactly
get to talk to him about it.

430
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:58,751
Look, i didn't have time.

431
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:00,051
He stripped off his drawer

432
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,518
And i had to fight fire with fire.

433
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:02,785
You guys are weird.

434
00:21:02,868 --> 00:21:04,884
Anyway, he already know
that if i move out,

435
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:07,217
Miss lauren gonna want me
to move in with r,

436
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,685
Or g a place of our own,

437
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,785
And i do not need
that kind of pressure.

438
00:21:10,868 --> 00:21:12,551
Well, don't you like miss lauren ?

439
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:15,151
Of course i do.
I love miss lauren.

440
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:16,484
Well, if you love her,

441
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,518
Why wouldn't you want
to be with her ?

442
00:21:18,601 --> 00:21:20,318
Dude, i brought you over here

443
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:22,685
To help me catch
this little dragony thing,

444
00:21:22,768 --> 00:21:25,785
Not to give me grief
about my commitment issues.

445
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,917
Now, come on.
Let's get you home.

446
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,367
Okay.

447
00:21:31,267 --> 00:21:33,950
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
What about the thing ?

448
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:35,251
What about it ?

449
00:21:35,334 --> 00:21:37,817
Its name is percy,
and it eats bugs and stuff.

450
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,451
No, no, no, no, no.

451
00:21:39,534 --> 00:21:41,785
You catch it, you keep it.

452
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:43,117
I already have chester.

453
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,418
Maybe you can trade percy in
at the pet store

454
00:21:45,501 --> 00:21:47,217
And get something else.

455
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,184
Either way,
you should talk to mouth.

456
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,067
He is your friend.

457
00:22:07,401 --> 00:22:09,418
I'm sorry.

458
00:22:09,501 --> 00:22:12,017
Everything you said was true.

459
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,751
I love nate and you and jami

460
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,917
And i should have done better
by all of you, and i'm sorry.

461
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,418
We're not paying her.

462
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:23,817
And if that's what you decide,
then of urse we're not.

463
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,618
<i>But it's not my dream,
and it's not your dream.</i>

464
00:22:26,701 --> 00:22:29,484
<i>In part it is,
but this i nathan's dream.</i>

465
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:31,817
He's worked so damn hard for it,

466
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,884
And he deserves it,
and i just want to protect it --

467
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:37,467
I me, for him and for you.

468
00:22:39,434 --> 00:22:41,751
This isn't fair.

469
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:44,518
I know it's not,
but if paying this woman

470
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:47,051
The money he makes
off one commercial

471
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:49,251
Protects jamie from all of this,

472
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:51,751
If it keeps his name safe
and his career safe

473
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:54,751
And u both finally get what
you've been chasing forever,

474
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:57,768
I think it's something
we should consider.

475
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:09,151
It's not fair, hales.

476
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:12,434
But nonef this is.

477
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:24,151
Dan : do you lieve in redemption ?

478
00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:26,067
Rachel : i believe in money.

479
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:28,868
Ory, anyway ?

480
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,134
Just hang out in strip clubs,
waiting to die ?

481
00:23:35,868 --> 00:23:37,351
Could be worse.

482
00:23:37,434 --> 00:23:40,834
Could be better.

483
00:23:46,567 --> 00:23:48,418
Lucas'novel.

484
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:49,584
Yeah.

485
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:51,518
Reminds me of who i used to be.

486
00:23:51,601 --> 00:23:54,351
You do know
you're the villain in this ?

487
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:57,184
The villain has power.

488
00:23:57,267 --> 00:23:59,284
I'm in here.

489
00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:01,117
I'm naked on the river court.

490
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,933
I know. Page 88.
It's bookmarked.

491
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:12,618
So, what's with the
self-help books ?

492
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,251
Best seller.

493
00:24:15,334 --> 00:24:18,134
Best seller.

494
00:24:18,234 --> 00:24:21,551
People are so lazy.

495
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:23,984
Instead of changing
their bad habits,

496
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:25,318
They just buy a book.

497
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:28,318
No, people aren't lazy.

498
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:30,351
They're afraid.

499
00:24:30,434 --> 00:24:32,584
They're afraid of dying

500
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:35,017
Without leaving their mark
on t world.

501
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,884
'cause they're lazy.

502
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:38,318
What about you ?

503
00:24:38,401 --> 00:24:40,518
Hmm.

504
00:24:40,601 --> 00:24:42,117
I left my mark on the world.

505
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,618
I just can't seem to die.

506
00:24:44,701 --> 00:24:46,933
But i do know one thing.

507
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,868
If people saw my life,

508
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:54,801
They'd feel a lot better
about theirs.

509
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:11,967
You want tget out of here ?

510
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,384
I can't.

511
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:17,418
Re you can.

512
00:25:17,501 --> 00:25:19,334
We both can.

513
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:23,300
Hey.

514
00:25:24,734 --> 00:25:26,667
Don't drink that.

515
00:25:32,434 --> 00:25:34,534
I need you.

516
00:25:47,534 --> 00:25:48,884
Hi.

517
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:50,318
Thanks for the trades.

518
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:52,618
I was going crazy withounews
from the real world.

519
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:54,584
<i>This is the real world, alex.</i>

520
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:56,251
Not for us.

521
00:25:56,334 --> 00:25:58,584
Well, it's too bad about
your lt movie falling apart.

522
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:00,117
U were good in it.
Oh, my god.

523
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,785
Those wigs made your head so itchy.

524
00:26:01,868 --> 00:26:05,300
After every take,
i was like, "uhh !"

525
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,950
Oh, crap.
I'm stuck in my extensions.

526
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:11,167
A little help ?

527
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:18,418
So, how come you're not doing
that movie in new zealand ?

528
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:20,418
Ow. I slept
with a couple actors on it.

529
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:21,551
And a few crew guys.

530
00:26:21,634 --> 00:26:22,850
Maybe at the same time.

531
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:24,917
Anyway, how me you're not doing it ?

532
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,284
I'm...
just looki for something else.

533
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:31,334
Well... i have something else
you might like.

534
00:26:34,067 --> 00:26:36,051
Thanks.

535
00:26:36,134 --> 00:26:38,967
P. s. -- you're totally cute.

536
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:50,084
Hey.

537
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:51,184
Hi.

538
00:26:51,267 --> 00:26:52,917
How's she doing ?

539
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,685
Your sister ?
She's amazing.

540
00:26:55,768 --> 00:26:57,017
And believe it or not,

541
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,284
This knucklehead actress
might actually be wortit.

542
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,418
Oh, great.

543
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:02,484
How you doing ?

544
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:04,100
Good.

545
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:10,868
Haley ?

546
00:27:13,267 --> 00:27:14,667
Not good.

547
00:27:21,434 --> 00:27:23,418
Everything was going so great
for us,

548
00:27:23,501 --> 00:27:25,084
And this woman comes along

549
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:26,217
And just turns our whole world
upside down.

550
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,051
Hales, you know i've been in
the tabloids as much as anybody.

551
00:27:29,134 --> 00:27:30,418
They lie all the time.

552
00:27:30,501 --> 00:27:32,584
And people will give nathan
the benefit of the doubt.

553
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,084
You know that, haley bob.

554
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:37,117
Alex : unless he did it.

555
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,184
My best friend katie
accused this guy

556
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:40,351
Of getting her pregnant,

557
00:27:40,434 --> 00:27:41,685
And it turns o he totally did it.

558
00:27:41,768 --> 00:27:43,384
He had to give her
like a butt load of money,

559
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:45,151
And then she got an abortion

560
00:27:45,234 --> 00:27:47,850
And bought the raddest fur coat.

561
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:49,467
Like way rad.

562
00:27:52,701 --> 00:27:53,718
We need a drink.

563
00:27:53,801 --> 00:27:54,751
Yeah.

564
00:27:54,834 --> 00:27:56,217
Not you.

565
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,868
Millicent, come geter !

566
00:28:06,701 --> 00:28:08,651
Mcfadden.

567
00:28:08,734 --> 00:28:10,501
Hey, what's the story
with nathan scott ?

568
00:28:11,834 --> 00:28:14,084
Nothing.

569
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:16,033
There is no story.

570
00:28:19,601 --> 00:28:21,184
Here's my problem with paying her.

571
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:22,551
It's not the money.

572
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,651
<i>I mean, it is the money,
but what if it comes out</i>

573
00:28:24,734 --> 00:28:27,184
That we paid some pregnant lady
to buy her silence ?

574
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:29,184
She would never be abl
to talk about it.

575
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:31,484
She'd have to sign
a confidentiality agreement.

576
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:33,084
What gonna stop her
from doing that ?

577
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:34,685
I mean, since wee clearly dealing

578
00:28:34,768 --> 00:28:36,618
With such a trustworthy
human being. Right.

579
00:28:36,701 --> 00:28:38,017
Quinn : i don't understand.

580
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,817
The woman claims
that she's pregnant, you know,

581
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,917
And that nathan's the father,
but in this day and age,

582
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,984
You can prove that kind of thing
so easily, you know,

583
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:47,418
With an amniocentesis or
eventually a blood test, so...

584
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:48,751
He didn't do it.

585
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:51,917
He said he didn't do it,
so i believe him.

586
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,184
Okay, of course, but then --

587
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:56,084
Look, she's hoping that nathan cas.

588
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,418
E's pregnant,
she doesn't have any money,

589
00:28:58,501 --> 00:29:00,950
And she knows that nathan scott
has a lot to lose,

590
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:02,217
So why not take a shot ?

591
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,584
I say you call her bluff

592
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,584
And don't pay the dumb bitch a dime.

593
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:08,051
That's what i said,
but it's gonna go public,

594
00:29:08,134 --> 00:29:09,484
And it's gonna affect jamie,

595
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:12,084
And nathan's basketball contract
is up for rewal.

596
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,318
Millicent : hi.

597
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:14,701
Hi.
Hi. hi.

598
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,534
I'll be right back.

599
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,917
Alex, you can't drink those.

600
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,618
Fine !
But love tequila.

601
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:29,950
Used to.
Here.

602
00:29:30,033 --> 00:29:32,318
You drink them,
and i'll just have the lime.

603
00:29:32,401 --> 00:29:33,685
No.

604
00:29:33,768 --> 00:29:35,900
Please ?
Pretty, pretty, pretty please ?

605
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:41,868
Mmm.

606
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:50,033
Ugh !
Nice !

607
00:29:50,134 --> 00:29:51,567
Are we drunk yet ?

608
00:29:53,634 --> 00:29:54,751
We're buzzed.

609
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,651
Oh, i miss being buzzed.

610
00:29:56,734 --> 00:29:58,751
Okay, don't tell any of the boys
that i'm sober.

611
00:29:58,834 --> 00:30:00,318
That way, if i do anything slutty,

612
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:01,584
I can still blame the booze.

613
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,067
Thank, millie. See ya.

614
00:30:06,534 --> 00:30:08,551
So, the photo shoot went well ?

615
00:30:08,634 --> 00:30:10,318
It went great, acally.

616
00:30:10,401 --> 00:30:13,718
This one's kind of good
at her job for being a james.

617
00:30:13,801 --> 00:30:15,484
Former james.

618
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:18,151
Possibly future james.

619
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,184
But thank you.

620
00:30:20,267 --> 00:30:23,584
You know, i used to make haley
bob pose for me all the time.

621
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:25,501
Remember, hales ?

622
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,151
Sorry.
I'm sorry, you guys.

623
00:30:31,234 --> 00:30:34,651
I really appreciate this,
but i'm gonngo talk to nathan.

624
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:36,251
I'll catch up with you later.

625
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,551
Hey.

626
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:40,051
I'm here for anything.

627
00:30:40,134 --> 00:30:41,584
I know.
Thank you.

628
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:43,084
I'll see you at home.

629
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:44,501
Ok.

630
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,251
You know what ?

631
00:30:48,334 --> 00:30:49,651
I should probably go
get some work done.

632
00:30:49,734 --> 00:30:51,117
Do you want to go ?

633
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,518
No, i think i'm gonna stay here.

634
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,251
Do you want to talk about it ?

635
00:30:55,334 --> 00:30:58,850
Truthfully,
i want to drink about it.

636
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:00,618
Okay.

637
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:02,584
You did great work today, quinn.

638
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:04,384
Thank you so much, brooke.

639
00:31:04,467 --> 00:31:06,000
Yeah.

640
00:31:22,033 --> 00:31:24,318
Mouth.

641
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:26,518
Yeah, ha ha, very funny.

642
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:28,917
You got me good, too, man.

643
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,850
No, i did not scream
like a little girl.

644
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:33,484
No, i did not.

645
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:35,651
Yeah, well, you would scream
like a little girl, too,

646
00:31:35,734 --> 00:31:37,134
If a reptile ambushed you like that.

647
00:31:39,067 --> 00:31:42,000
Look, anyway,
i want to call a truce.

648
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,234
So, we need to talk when
you get home later, all right ?

649
00:31:48,634 --> 00:31:51,167
No, it was just something
jamie said.

650
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:54,484
So, i guess i'll see you later,

651
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:56,701
And i guess i'll try
and explain it to you.

652
00:31:59,067 --> 00:32:00,384
All right, bro.

653
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:01,467
All right.
Late

654
00:32:19,634 --> 00:32:21,701
How am i gonna explain this to him ?

655
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,234
Maybe you won't have to.

656
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:33,284
I... i hate that
somebody can do this to you

657
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:35,384
And get away with it,
nathan -- i do.

658
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:38,051
But...

659
00:32:38,134 --> 00:32:39,917
You're the one who fought
as hard as you did

660
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,251
To get where you are now,

661
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,251
And you're the one
who never gave up yourself,

662
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:45,518
So...

663
00:32:45,601 --> 00:32:47,718
If you want to make
this hole thing go away,

664
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:50,685
Then you do that,

665
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:53,000
And i won't speak of it again.

666
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,785
Let me get a dixie
and a shot of tequila, chilled.

667
00:33:17,868 --> 00:33:19,850
<i>I love tequila.</i>

668
00:33:19,933 --> 00:33:21,384
Used to.

669
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:23,651
Doesn't go too well with rehab.

670
00:33:23,734 --> 00:33:25,718
Alex dupré, right ?
Right.

671
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:27,917
And you're that boy who owns
the big house on the beach.

672
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,251
<i>I'm the boy that rents
that big house on the beach.</i>

673
00:33:30,334 --> 00:33:31,284
Clay.

674
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:32,618
Hi.

675
00:33:32,701 --> 00:33:34,418

Go ahead.
Just do it quick.

677
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,484
I miss that.

678
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:51,100
The kissing or the drinking ?

679
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:54,318
Yes.

680
00:33:54,401 --> 00:33:55,817
Quinn : wow.

681
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,051
You're a piece of work.

682
00:33:58,134 --> 00:34:00,484
My sister's in tears,
my brother-in-law's unemployed,

683
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:02,884

with dumb girls at the bar.

684
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:05,334
Wow, your husband must be
so happy right now.

685
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:09,618
I'm sorry.
That was unfair.

686
00:34:09,701 --> 00:34:13,200

If i was one of your clients,
i'd be listed as "day to day

689
00:34:21,367 --> 00:34:23,434
Aren't we all ?

690
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,801
Nate.

691
00:34:33,367 --> 00:34:35,868
Okay.

692
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:40,551
I got toun.

693
00:34:40,634 --> 00:34:41,734
Hey, clay ?

694
00:34:43,134 --> 00:34:45,117
I hope you know what you're doing.

695
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,601
You too.

696
00:34:48,501 --> 00:34:50,685
I can be in your bed in 20 minutes.

697
00:34:50,768 --> 00:34:52,567
Make it 30.

698
00:34:56,067 --> 00:34:58,117
Quinn :eally ?

699
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,184
<i>You're that guy ?</i>

700
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:02,100
I am tonight.

701
00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:14,151
What's on your mind, baby ?

702
00:35:14,234 --> 00:35:15,667
Oh.

703
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:21,651
I'm sorry what happened today
with that man in the crowd

704
00:35:21,734 --> 00:35:25,300
You work so hard for me and --
and the show, and i just...

705
00:35:27,367 --> 00:35:28,950
I'm sorry.

706
00:35:29,033 --> 00:35:30,651
I'm not.

707
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:32,718
I hired hito do it.

708
00:35:32,801 --> 00:35:35,051
Why ?

709
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:39,117
Because you can't hide
from what you did, dan.

710
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,284
And because whenever we shine
a light on your mistakes,

711
00:35:42,367 --> 00:35:43,817
You fight back,

712
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,217
And that inspires people.

713
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,834
Besides, it makes for good tv.

714
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,950
Hi.

715
00:36:04,033 --> 00:36:06,184
Alex.

716
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:07,718
What can i do for you ?

717
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:09,984
You said you were loing
for something different.

718
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,551
Look, alex, i --

I know what you're thinking.

720
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,785
You're thinking i'm hot,
and you're also thinking

721
00:36:17,868 --> 00:36:20,618
The dumb actress

722
00:36:20,701 --> 00:36:22,900
But it's not stupid,
and i'm not dumb.

723
00:36:24,134 --> 00:36:26,384
Okay, well, i'm a little dumb,

724
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:28,534
But i know a good script
when i read it.

725
00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:32,534
Okay.
I'll take a look.

726
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:38,418
Hey, when i said i had
something different for you,

727
00:36:38,501 --> 00:36:40,318
You thought i meant me, huh ?

728
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:44,051
Um... no.

You're gonna have to

735
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:24,817
Well, at least you're wring pants.

00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,017

00:37:28,501 --> 00:37:29,685
So what ?
You love lauren.

739
00:37:29,768 --> 00:37:32,084
I know, but, look,

740
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,318
And then she gonna want
to get married.

741
00:37:34,401 --> 00:37:37,184
And, man, we even ain't

742
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:39,685
<i>Look, i'm not even sure
if i ever want to get married.</i>

743
00:37:39,768 --> 00:37:42,917
And i'm not saying that i don't
love lauren, because i do.

744
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,284
I'm just not sure
what i want to do yet.

745
00:37:45,367 --> 00:37:47,017
Well, you shld have said that.

746
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,967
Yeah, well, you should have asked.

747
00:37:51,367 --> 00:37:54,351
You're a good roommate, skills,
and a good friend.

748
00:37:54,434 --> 00:37:56,768
You stay as long as you want,

749
00:38:00,267 --> 00:38:01,933
All right.

750
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:41,518
I didn't expect her
to be such a mess.

751
00:38:41,601 --> 00:38:42,984
I'm sorry about that.

752
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:46,184
No, me too, but i'll tell you
what -- the camera loves her.

753
00:38:46,267 --> 00:38:50,151
She looks healthy and smart...

00:38:50,234 --> 00:38:52,217
Happy.

755
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,134
Hmm.

Yeah.

759
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,685
This is, uh...

760
00:39:25,768 --> 00:39:27,451
This is the amount
that we're willing to pay

761
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:29,334
To make this go away.

762
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,950
It's empty.

763
00:39:37,033 --> 00:39:38,284
That's right.

764
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:40,984
It's empty because
you're a lying bitch,

765
00:39:41,067 --> 00:39:43,184
And we're not paying you a dime.

766
00:39:43,267 --> 00:39:45,434
Go to hell.

767
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,618
He talked to her.

768
00:40:05,701 --> 00:40:07,900
It didn't go well.

769
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:11,033
It's gon get worse.

770
00:40:13,234 --> 00:40:15,933
I should talk to jamie.
