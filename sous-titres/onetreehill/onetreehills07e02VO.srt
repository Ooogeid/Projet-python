1
00:00:02,701 --> 00:00:04,400
I decided not to produce the movie.

2
00:00:03,967 --> 00:00:05,368
There's this girl that...

3
00:00:05,434 --> 00:00:08,167
I'm kind of in love with, and...

4
00:00:08,234 --> 00:00:11,034
I couldn't be away from her for another day.

5
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:13,301
I know the label's gonna run a lot smoother

6
00:00:13,368 --> 00:00:14,600
with you at the helm.

7
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:16,301
I'm not here to run the label.

8
00:00:16,368 --> 00:00:17,834
I'm here to close it.

9
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,934
You're mad because I want you to move out,

10
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:22,867
but it's only because I'm trying to step things up with Millie.

11
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:24,834
You trying to get rid of me with your naked ass.

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,001
It ain't gonna work.

13
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,134
You know earlier when...

14
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:29,301
when I said I miss David?

15
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:30,600
What happened, Quinn? You said he...

16
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:31,767
I left him.

17
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:33,368
Does that girl look familiar to you?

18
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:35,067
Yeah, she was at the party today. Why?

19
00:00:35,134 --> 00:00:37,234
She says she slept with you on the road, Nate,

20
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:39,034
and she's going public.

21
00:00:40,168 --> 00:00:45,792
One tree hiil s07e02
sync by yescool

22
00:00:54,217 --> 00:00:57,084
And where will you run...

23
00:00:57,151 --> 00:00:58,884
back to the life of a peasant harlot?

24
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,351
Perhaps I will.

25
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:02,984
But should I return to a life of more meager means,

26
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,417
I will do so with my dignity intact,

27
00:01:05,484 --> 00:01:08,284
my heart pure and true.

28
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:11,084
And yet you had no dignity nor purity

29
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:13,884
in my bed a fortnight ago.

30
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:18,184
Meager means, indeed.

31
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:19,084
Harlot!

32
00:01:20,884 --> 00:01:22,817
Leave the dress!

33
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:25,750
Millie was right.

34
00:01:25,817 --> 00:01:27,351
Alex Dupré is the perfect choice

35
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:29,351
to be the face of the new campaign.

36
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:31,817
She's smart. She's talented.

37
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:34,117
She is crazy beautiful.

38
00:01:34,184 --> 00:01:36,117
Julian?
I'm shaving!

39
00:01:36,184 --> 00:01:38,251
How come this movie never came out?

40
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:40,217
Because smart and talented and beautiful

41
00:01:40,284 --> 00:01:42,050
got all hopped up on goofballs

42
00:01:42,117 --> 00:01:43,284
and had to be checked into rehab.

43
00:01:44,518 --> 00:01:45,783
By the way, those dailies are top secret.

44
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,484
I had to call in about a dozen favors to get 'em.

45
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:51,584
Aww, my baby's so good to me.

46
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,917
Damn.

47
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,850
I am really gonna like this living-together thing.

48
00:02:02,717 --> 00:02:04,518
I want you to move your stuff in, okay?

49
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:06,451
This is our house now, not just mine.

50
00:02:06,518 --> 00:02:08,184
Good.

51
00:02:10,384 --> 00:02:12,518
Well, then how would you feel about going back

52
00:02:12,584 --> 00:02:14,217
to our bedroom for a little while?

53
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:17,850
I'd make a joke about meager means, but...

54
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:20,551
it would simply be untrue.

55
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:27,783
Hey.

56
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,317
You know I'm not judging you, right?

57
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:33,151
Clay, listen, man, you've known me for a long time now.

58
00:02:33,217 --> 00:02:35,050
I don't care what that woman says.

59
00:02:35,117 --> 00:02:36,917
I did not sleep with her, all right?

60
00:02:36,984 --> 00:02:38,417
All right.

61
00:02:38,484 --> 00:02:40,518
It's unbelievable to me that she could just show up

62
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:42,683
and spout a bunch of lies,
and the next thing you know,

63
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,084
I'm in the headlines, my family's in the headlines,

64
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:46,917
and I'm guilty before I'm innocent.

65
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:48,551
Don't freak out. You're not in the headlines yet.

66
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:49,950
And believe it or not, this kind of thing,

67
00:02:50,017 --> 00:02:50,884
it happens a lot.

68
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,417
You're a public figure,

69
00:02:52,484 --> 00:02:53,984
and they know you make a lot of money.

70
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,783
I'm in a contract year, Clay.

71
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,650
I know. So, here's what you're gonna do.

72
00:02:57,717 --> 00:02:59,850
You're gonna stay in shape,
you're gonna stay focused,

73
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:01,050
and you're gonna let me handle it.

74
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:02,017
All right?

75
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:05,351
All right.

76
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:10,484
*yeah*

77
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,017
It has been ringing off the hook.

78
00:03:18,084 --> 00:03:21,618
*waves crash along* ...

79
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:25,717
Quinn, what happened?

80
00:03:25,783 --> 00:03:29,251
I mean, what actually happened between you and David?

81
00:03:29,317 --> 00:03:32,251
He just changed, you know?

82
00:03:32,317 --> 00:03:37,950
I mean, he used to see the world exactly the way I saw it.

83
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,984
He just doesn't anymore.

84
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,417
But he still loves you.

85
00:03:43,618 --> 00:03:46,317
I know.

86
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:48,817
But I don't know if that's enough.

87
00:03:50,817 --> 00:03:51,850
I'm sorry. I got to go.

88
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:53,184
I got to go down to the studio

89
00:03:53,251 --> 00:03:55,217
and take care of this whole "shutting us down" mess.

90
00:03:55,284 --> 00:03:57,451
Do you need my help?
No.

91
00:03:57,518 --> 00:03:59,317
You just stay here and enjoy your day.

92
00:03:59,384 --> 00:04:00,551
I'll see you later.

93
00:04:00,618 --> 00:04:02,584
Okay.

94
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,584
It's gonna be okay, Quinn.

95
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,251
I love you.

96
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:08,017
I love you, too.

97
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:11,618
*keep your hello*

98
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:16,351
*don't think about it at all*

99
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:18,451
Is it okay?

100
00:04:18,518 --> 00:04:20,151
You're good.

101
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:21,518
Damn it, Skills!

102
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:23,384
What up, Millie?

103
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:26,317
You and Marvin need to stop
this ridiculous naked standoff!

104
00:04:26,384 --> 00:04:28,084
Hey, look, he started it, trying to get me to move out.

105
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:30,518
Okay, look...

106
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:32,417
I'm going to pick up Alex Dupré from the airport.

107
00:04:32,484 --> 00:04:34,618
I'm gonna work a full day, and when I get home,

108
00:04:34,683 --> 00:04:36,817
you two idiots better have your pants on!

109
00:04:39,317 --> 00:04:42,317
So, what are you gonna do?

110
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:44,384
I ain't moving out. That's for sure.
Why not?

111
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,518
If Chester hopped around without his fur on,

112
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:47,750
I'd probably move out.

113
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:49,783
Yeah, well, it's a long story.

114
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,683
So, you ready for the beach?

115
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,184
Totally.

116
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,950
You think I can bury you
and Miss Lauren in the sand?

117
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:56,451
Cool with me.

118
00:04:56,518 --> 00:04:57,984
Oh, and, um, don't tell Miss Lauren

119
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,717
about the whole moving-out stuff, all right?

120
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:00,984
Why not?

121
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,884
Just don't. Wait. Uh-Oh, here she comes.

122
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,117
Hey, boys.

123
00:05:04,184 --> 00:05:07,151
Ready for the beach?

124
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,650
What are you guys up to?

125
00:05:12,717 --> 00:05:13,451
Nothing.
Nothing.

126
00:05:13,518 --> 00:05:15,351
Huh.

127
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:17,618
*that girl's a genius*

128
00:05:17,683 --> 00:05:19,551
*whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh*

129
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,117
Never believe that you can deceive.

130
00:05:24,184 --> 00:05:27,050
You might think that you can get away with it.

131
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:29,650
You might actually get away with it...

132
00:05:29,717 --> 00:05:31,384
for a while.

133
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:35,251
But your life is made up of choices and decisions.

134
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:39,584
Hi, Julian.

135
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,151
Dad.

136
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,184
What are you doing here?

137
00:05:44,251 --> 00:05:47,251
I came to talk you out of the worst decision of your life.

138
00:05:47,317 --> 00:05:51,618
Poor choices, poor life.

139
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:54,484
Bad decisions...

140
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:57,317
bad life.

141
00:05:57,384 --> 00:06:01,050
Come on. Where is it?

142
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:03,783
Page 17, item 4...

143
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,850
It's the part of the contract that basically says

144
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:08,650
we can acquire the label whenever we'd like.

145
00:06:08,717 --> 00:06:09,950
Wickedness...

146
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:12,950
As you know, I've been there.

147
00:06:13,017 --> 00:06:14,783
I'm not alone.

148
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,351
My wife was, too.

149
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:20,351
She was deceptive and manipulative.

150
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:22,584
She abused drink and drugs.

151
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,351
She was promiscuous.

152
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:28,850
But today she stands beside me a changed woman,

153
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:32,650
a caring woman, a better woman.

154
00:06:32,717 --> 00:06:35,717
Ladies and gentlemen, my wife and the love of my life.

155
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,484
*my girl's ready to take control*

156
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:52,817
*she just blows my mind*

157
00:06:52,884 --> 00:06:54,683
*she only listens to the radio*

158
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,551
I love you, honey.

159
00:06:56,618 --> 00:06:58,817
I love you, honey.

160
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:01,750
*yeah* !

161
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:05,151
*she wakes up scared of getting old*

162
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:15,084
I didn't make a bad decision, dad.

163
00:07:15,151 --> 00:07:17,484
Is that right?

164
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:20,251
You walked away from a potential blockbuster movie

165
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:23,251
days before production, and for what?

166
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,284
For love.

167
00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:26,683
Love...

168
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,184
with Brooke Davis.

169
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:29,817
Be careful, dad.

170
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:32,384
Julian, she's Brooke Davis!

171
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:33,584
I read the tabloids.

172
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,117
This is a fling for her,

173
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:37,351
and it could cost you your career!

174
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:39,618
I think you need to leave.

175
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:44,417
*behind the tv screen I've fallen to my knees*

176
00:07:44,484 --> 00:07:49,251
Your career was one movie away
from being prestigious...

177
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:51,618
This movie.

178
00:07:51,683 --> 00:07:53,618
And you walk away.

179
00:07:53,683 --> 00:07:57,650
For what? A promiscuous fashion designer.

180
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,850
*I need to get away*

181
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:03,950
*blanket of silence*

182
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,683
*makes me want to sink my teeth in deep*

183
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,017
*burn all the evidence*

184
00:08:08,084 --> 00:08:10,050
Oh, this glass is gonna look amazing

185
00:08:10,117 --> 00:08:11,351
in my loft in Los Angeles.

186
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:12,917
All right, Miranda,

187
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:15,451
I know that you have a legal
right to shut down the label,

188
00:08:15,518 --> 00:08:17,917
but you don't have to be a total bitch about it.

189
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:19,551
You're the producer, Haley,

190
00:08:19,618 --> 00:08:21,351
and, potentially, a great artist,

191
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,850
but you don't have time to record

192
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:26,084
because you're running what is essentially a vanity label.

193
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:27,284
Va...  vanity la...

194
00:08:27,351 --> 00:08:28,950
You guys would not have

195
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:31,584
Mia Catalano if it wasn't for this label.

196
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,217
You wouldn't have had the time or patience or interest

197
00:08:34,284 --> 00:08:36,750
to develop an artist like her.

198
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,717
That's what small labels do.

199
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:40,284
We develop and nurture artists.

200
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:42,284
It's something corporate labels will never do.

201
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:49,050
I've always wanted a pool table.

202
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:54,650
I can't believe your dad just came all this way

203
00:08:54,717 --> 00:08:56,783
to tell you he thinks you're making a mistake.

204
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,451
He couldn't call or text or tweet that to you?

205
00:09:00,518 --> 00:09:03,518
He's a movie producer, Brooke. He loves the dramatic.

206
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,251
Well, what else did he say?

207
00:09:05,317 --> 00:09:07,284
He wanted to know what my game plan was...

208
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:08,817
was I still actively producing,

209
00:09:08,884 --> 00:09:10,084
do I have a development staff

210
00:09:10,151 --> 00:09:11,384
finding me new properties, and...

211
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:12,884
That is some poster.

212
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,551
What? Oh, right. You like it?

213
00:09:14,618 --> 00:09:15,783
Yeah.

214
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,251
It's... different for the living room.

215
00:09:18,317 --> 00:09:20,151
He was just so crazy, my father.

216
00:09:20,217 --> 00:09:22,551
Do you think maybe you would like that better

217
00:09:22,618 --> 00:09:24,050
in the spare bedroom

218
00:09:24,117 --> 00:09:25,551
or in your office?

219
00:09:25,618 --> 00:09:27,683
We could get you an office for that.

220
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,151
Look, my dad just flew five hours

221
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:31,251
to ask me if I'm quitting the
business and getting married.

222
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:32,884
What did you say?

223
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,650
I asked him to leave.

224
00:09:34,717 --> 00:09:38,184
No, about the "marriage" part.

225
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:40,384
I told him he was crazy.
We're not getting married.

226
00:09:40,451 --> 00:09:41,650
We just moved in together.

227
00:09:43,518 --> 00:09:45,484
I... I don't... I don't know what the hell got into him.

228
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,850
*I ain't got no other place to hide*

229
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,917
*chained down like a sitting duck*

230
00:09:49,984 --> 00:09:52,750
*just waiting for the fall*

231
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:54,151
Hey, you.

232
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,117
The clock... it was a good idea.

233
00:09:58,184 --> 00:10:01,817
I think it reminds people
that every second counts.

234
00:10:01,884 --> 00:10:03,451
It's easy.

235
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:06,184
People don't have to work that hard to get it.

236
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:08,084
We have that dinner tonight

237
00:10:08,151 --> 00:10:10,683
with the investment guys from Texas.

238
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,217
I think you should tell them

239
00:10:12,284 --> 00:10:15,717
the whole "phoenix rising from the ashes" story.

240
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:16,884
They'll love it.

241
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,884
It was a good show today.

242
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,284
I think we might have reached some people.

243
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:23,484
Do you think it was a good show?

244
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:26,683
I'll let you know after I see the ratings.

245
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,850
I got to go.

246
00:10:29,284 --> 00:10:30,618
Hey.

247
00:10:32,351 --> 00:10:34,217
I love you.

248
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:37,151
I know, baby.

249
00:10:37,217 --> 00:10:38,783
Wear your gray suit tonight.

250
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,717
You always look good in that suit.

251
00:10:48,351 --> 00:10:51,084
Guys.

252
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,417
Right here!
Right here!

253
00:10:56,151 --> 00:10:57,817
Hey. There you go.

254
00:10:57,884 --> 00:10:59,251
One more.

255
00:10:59,317 --> 00:11:00,551
Miss Dupré? Miss dupré?

256
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,251
Could I get an autograph?

257
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:03,618
Oh, yeah, sure, you pretty thing.

258
00:11:03,683 --> 00:11:04,650
What's your name?

259
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:05,551
Tanya.

260
00:11:05,618 --> 00:11:06,917
Tanya?

261
00:11:06,984 --> 00:11:08,184
I loved you in "Heart so true".

262
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,484
You were so brave in that.

263
00:11:09,551 --> 00:11:11,650
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

264
00:11:11,717 --> 00:11:13,683
But that's just acting. You're the brave one.

265
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,683
Thanks.

266
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,618
Bye. Bye bye.

267
00:11:16,683 --> 00:11:18,650
Alex, Millicent Huxtable, Clothes Over Bros.

268
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:19,750
Welcome to Tree Hill.

269
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:21,683
Thank you.

270
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:27,717
Can I just say that I am your biggest fan?

271
00:11:27,783 --> 00:11:29,451
And it's because of things like that...

272
00:11:29,518 --> 00:11:30,884
that you would take the time

273
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,484
to inspire that poor girl in the wheelchair

274
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:33,783
after such a long flight.

275
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,518
They kind of creep me out.

276
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:37,384
What? Cripples and, like, retarded people.

277
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:39,717
They're always, like, drooling and smiling really weird.

278
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:40,750
It's so gross.

279
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:43,518
Water, water, water.

280
00:11:43,584 --> 00:11:45,618
Um, is there any wine in here?

281
00:11:45,683 --> 00:11:48,783
Um, I thought you were sober.
You just went to rehab.

282
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,217
Ugh, do not remind me.

283
00:11:50,284 --> 00:11:51,417
They took my phone away.

284
00:11:51,484 --> 00:11:52,783
Besides, wine's not even alcohol.

285
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,817
It's like grape.

286
00:11:53,884 --> 00:11:56,351
Ugh, it's so hot out there.

287
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:57,750
Where the hell are we?

288
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,117
It's like the devil's ass in this place.

289
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:02,017
When do I get paid?

290
00:12:02,084 --> 00:12:04,217
I think your agent takes care of that.

291
00:12:04,284 --> 00:12:05,917
Can I just tell you... I hate that woman.

292
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:07,551
She's like a complete alcoholic,

293
00:12:07,618 --> 00:12:09,551
and her fingers look like chicken feet.

294
00:12:09,618 --> 00:12:12,683
Btw, I am starving. Is there any food?

295
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,817
Well, I read that you only eat organic food,

296
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:17,451
so we have an entire organic feast waiting at the hotel.

297
00:12:17,518 --> 00:12:19,317
Yeah, I just make that stuff up.

298
00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:21,817
Can you drive through a Mickey d's?

299
00:12:21,884 --> 00:12:23,484
I could totally eat the butt off a skunk right now.

300
00:12:23,551 --> 00:12:26,317
Um, drive on...

301
00:12:26,384 --> 00:12:27,950
please.

302
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:29,551
Nate, it's gonna be okay.

303
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:31,184
You know, we haven't heard from this woman

304
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,650
since the one e-mail.

305
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:35,284
So, until it's real, it's not real.

306
00:12:35,351 --> 00:12:36,817
You know, and besides,

307
00:12:36,884 --> 00:12:38,584
who the hell would want
to sleep with you, anyway?

308
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:42,017
Okay, I know it's bad timing,

309
00:12:42,084 --> 00:12:43,384
but damn.

310
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:45,650
Dude, quit checking out my sister-in-law.

311
00:12:45,717 --> 00:12:46,950
Hey, dumb and dumber.

312
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,184
Hey.

313
00:12:49,618 --> 00:12:50,717
Nice day, huh?

314
00:12:55,017 --> 00:12:57,984
I don't know. Maybe you're right.

315
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,618
Maybe it's nothing.

316
00:13:02,251 --> 00:13:04,518
Actually, uh...

317
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,017
now it is something.

318
00:13:19,784 --> 00:13:21,084
My hat!

319
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,651
I'll get it.

320
00:13:22,717 --> 00:13:23,884
Ohh.

321
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:25,183
Can you move?

322
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,817
Not a muscle.
Me neither.

323
00:13:28,051 --> 00:13:30,717
Man, I hope that knucklehead come back.

324
00:13:30,784 --> 00:13:32,917
So, listen, Peyton, here's the thing...

325
00:13:32,984 --> 00:13:35,317
Uh, you know how I...

326
00:13:35,384 --> 00:13:38,651
insisted that you keep that 1% of the label?

327
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,951
Well, it... it kind of killed the label.

328
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,951
But, Haley...
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

329
00:13:48,018 --> 00:13:49,851
I can see that I'm upsetting you,

330
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:51,283
and I don't want to do that.

331
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,550
So, um, let me just, uh...

332
00:13:55,617 --> 00:13:57,217
Talk to Lucas.

333
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:02,217
Geez, Haley,

334
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:04,717
I... I... I... I... I don't know, you know?

335
00:14:04,784 --> 00:14:08,150
This has really meant a lot to... peyton.

336
00:14:08,217 --> 00:14:09,484
I know. I know.

337
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,784
I'm a terrible friend,

338
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,183
and there's nothing that I can do unless I...

339
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:18,018
You might be a genius, Haley.

340
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:20,118
Thank you, Haley.

341
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,250
* am I *

342
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:26,717
* am I losing my mind? *

343
00:14:28,217 --> 00:14:29,384
Jamie?

344
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,350
Aunt Quinn!

345
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:31,484
Hey!

346
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,217
Who let you off your leash?

347
00:14:33,283 --> 00:14:35,283
Uncle Skills, but he didn't bring the leash today.

348
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,450
Okay, where is he?

349
00:14:36,517 --> 00:14:38,350
He's over there. Miss Lauren, too.

350
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:40,350
This is her hat. Cool.

351
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:42,217
Well, I was just on my way to go get a snack.

352
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:43,550
Can I tempt you?
Sure.

353
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:45,250
Yeah? You should probably tell them you're with me.

354
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,851
Denzel, this is Macaulay. Denzel, this is Macaulay.

355
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:50,084
I'm going for a snack with my aunt Quinn. Over.

356
00:14:52,018 --> 00:14:55,217
Okay, all set. Stupid, crazy nanny.

357
00:14:55,283 --> 00:14:57,350
Hop on.

358
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:58,651
Whoop! There we go.

359
00:14:58,717 --> 00:14:59,851
What do you want?

360
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:02,584
Hey, give me a sec, okay?

361
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,751
Okay.

362
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:18,350
Mind if I join you?

363
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,584
Spare a few bucks?

364
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:25,917
First...

365
00:15:25,984 --> 00:15:28,584
you mind telling me how you got here?

366
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:31,751
You must be one of them religious guys or something.

367
00:15:31,817 --> 00:15:33,450
No.

368
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,084
I got nothing against religion.

369
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:37,684
If you ask me,

370
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:39,751
the one man you got to believe in...

371
00:15:39,817 --> 00:15:41,384
is you.

372
00:15:43,118 --> 00:15:45,817
I stopped believing in me a long time ago.

373
00:15:45,884 --> 00:15:47,817
Why?

374
00:15:47,884 --> 00:15:49,018
You made some mistakes?

375
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:52,350
You failed sometimes?

376
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:55,517
Listen.

377
00:15:55,584 --> 00:15:58,684
No matter what mistakes or failures you had,

378
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:00,717
they weren't even close to mine.

379
00:16:03,584 --> 00:16:06,651
There's a book you should read.

380
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:09,484
You talking about the bible.

381
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,217
No, man, it's not the bible. It's this book.

382
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,250
Listen.

383
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:20,617
There's a used-book shop around the corner.

384
00:16:20,684 --> 00:16:24,617
Now, you can take this book, sell it for a few bucks,

385
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:27,183
buy yourself a bottle,

386
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,817
and feel good for a few minutes.

387
00:16:30,884 --> 00:16:33,584
Or you could read it

388
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:36,051
and feel better for the rest of your life.

389
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,217
Hey.

390
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:49,651
What your name is, man?

391
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:53,118
My name is Dan Scott.

392
00:16:53,183 --> 00:16:55,317
And I believe in you.

393
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:10,350
He probably didn't mean it.

394
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,018
It was just the way he said it,

395
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:14,751
as if the very idea of us ever getting married

396
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:16,951
was somehow completely ridiculous to him.

397
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:20,283
And then he hung this ugly army-man poster

398
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,784
in the living room.

399
00:17:21,851 --> 00:17:23,517
I have to talk to him.

400
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,084
Okay, but he might freak out a little

401
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,651
if you start talking marriage so soon.

402
00:17:26,717 --> 00:17:30,150
No, about the poster, you dork. It has to go.

403
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,651
I am really excited to meet Alex, though.

404
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:34,851
How is she?

405
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:37,350
Um...

406
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:40,350
she's really... something.

407
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:41,784
She just wanted to freshen up.

408
00:17:41,851 --> 00:17:43,118
You're gonna love her.

409
00:17:44,784 --> 00:17:46,217
She's gonna hate you!

410
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:47,484
Go away, you witch.

411
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,784
"Witch"? "Witch"?!

412
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:51,417
Look, missy,

413
00:17:51,484 --> 00:17:53,084
my ass is on the line here!

414
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,417
You mean your big ass.

415
00:17:54,484 --> 00:17:56,617
Really? Really? Get up!

416
00:17:56,684 --> 00:17:57,884
I'm tired!

417
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,450
Well, you better get un-tired

418
00:17:59,517 --> 00:18:00,917
because you're going over to Clothes Over Bros,

419
00:18:00,984 --> 00:18:02,751
and you're gonna convince Brooke Davis

420
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:04,817
that the half-million dollars she's
paying you is not a waste!

421
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:09,250
Half a million dollars?

422
00:18:19,584 --> 00:18:22,784
So, you want to talk?

423
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,118
Talk.

424
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:27,450
What, no "hello"? No introductions?

425
00:18:27,517 --> 00:18:28,684
Your name's Renee.

426
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:30,584
I recognize you from the picture you took

427
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,051
when you trespassed at a 7-Year-Old's birthday party.

428
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:34,384
You have a last name?

429
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,051
You're kind of hot when you're all fired up.

430
00:18:37,118 --> 00:18:39,784
I know he didn't do it.

431
00:18:39,851 --> 00:18:41,350
I don't know what your angle is,

432
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:43,283
and I don't know why you targeted Nathan Scott,

433
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,550
but what I do know is that he didn't do it.

434
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:50,717
You're quite the party boy, aren't you?

435
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:53,717
I'm single.
He's not.

436
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:55,317
Oh, like that matters.

437
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:59,651
Maybe not to girls like you, but to Nathan it does.

438
00:18:59,717 --> 00:19:03,617
"Girls like me."

439
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,517
You know what's so great about justice?

440
00:19:06,584 --> 00:19:09,550
It doesn't discriminate against "girls like me."

441
00:19:09,617 --> 00:19:10,917
What do you want from me?

442
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,851
Whoa, walk away, Nate.

443
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:15,051
Huh? Hi, Nathan. You need to stop this.

444
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:17,018
Outside. You need to stop this now, okay?

445
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:18,283
Do you hear me?

446
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,183
Why are you doing this to me?

447
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,217
Come on.

448
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,984
What the hell is wrong with you?

449
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,751
I just wanted to talk to her.

450
00:19:39,817 --> 00:19:41,051
In public?

451
00:19:41,118 --> 00:19:42,217
In front of a roomful of people

452
00:19:42,283 --> 00:19:43,283
with camera phones and video,

453
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,450
you wanted to talk with her,

454
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,484
just thought you'd have a little chat?

455
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,984
I'm sorry. I screwed up.

456
00:19:47,051 --> 00:19:49,084
Yeah, you screwed up, Nate!

457
00:19:53,384 --> 00:19:54,984
What does she want?

458
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:56,250
I don't know.

459
00:19:56,317 --> 00:19:57,817
I was about to find out

460
00:19:57,884 --> 00:20:00,584
until Nathan Scott stormed in like a madman!

461
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:02,217
Look, I said I was sorry, jackass.

462
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:03,250
Let it go.

463
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:10,717
I'm gonna see if she'll sit down with me again.

464
00:20:10,784 --> 00:20:15,517
In the meantime, you just, um...

465
00:20:15,584 --> 00:20:18,651
Try not to get thrown through a window, all right?

466
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,317
Damn it, nate.

467
00:20:29,717 --> 00:20:30,984
Brooke?

468
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:32,550
Please don't fire me. Please don't fire me.

469
00:20:32,617 --> 00:20:35,884
Shut up. I'm an actress. I got this.

470
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:39,118
Alex, hi, I'm Brooke Davis.
It's so nice to meet you.

471
00:20:39,183 --> 00:20:41,484
Oh... my... God.

472
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,317
You are so beautiful.

473
00:20:43,384 --> 00:20:45,183
Thank you.

474
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,717
Can I just say that I'm so happy to be here?

475
00:20:47,784 --> 00:20:49,617
And I think it's so great

476
00:20:49,684 --> 00:20:52,183
that you make designer clothes for plus-sized girls.

477
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,283
I never knew it was based on you,

478
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,250
but I think that's so sweet.

479
00:20:56,317 --> 00:20:58,917
Uh, no, I'm normal-sized.

480
00:20:58,984 --> 00:21:01,584
Oh, I know, but I have the best diet for you.

481
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:04,018
You're so gonna lose that weight.

482
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:06,183
Okay. How was your flight?

483
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,051
You flew private, right?

484
00:21:08,118 --> 00:21:09,250
Uh-Huh.

485
00:21:09,317 --> 00:21:10,484
They let me ride in the cockpit.

486
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,717
It was so rad.

487
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:13,283
In the cockpit?
Totally.

488
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,384
They let me steer the plane and everything.

489
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,417
They let you fly the plane.

490
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,717
I know! I'm so a cockpit girl.

491
00:21:19,784 --> 00:21:21,018
That's what she said.

492
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:23,118
Who?
Who what?

493
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:24,617
You... you said she said something,

494
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:25,951
but I don't know who you mean.

495
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,250
No, it's... it's an expression.

496
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:31,450
When someone says something that sounds sexual,

497
00:21:31,517 --> 00:21:34,283
you say, "that's what she said".

498
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,984
Oh. Right.

499
00:21:37,051 --> 00:21:39,118
Okay.

500
00:21:39,183 --> 00:21:40,617
Why don't we show Alex the new line?

501
00:21:40,684 --> 00:21:42,484
Great. You're gonna love it.

502
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,817
It's kind of elegant and kind of edgy,

503
00:21:45,884 --> 00:21:48,384
and the pieces are a lot like this one.

504
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,550
No, I don't like that.

505
00:21:50,617 --> 00:21:51,784
Why?

506
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:53,183
Uh, first of all, it's purple.

507
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,417
When I was a little girl,

508
00:21:54,484 --> 00:21:55,917
there was this dinosaur thing,

509
00:21:55,984 --> 00:21:57,984
and it totally freaked me out, and it was purple.

510
00:21:58,051 --> 00:21:59,984
You mean Barney?

511
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:02,283
Yeah. That's what she said.

512
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,717
Okay.

513
00:22:03,784 --> 00:22:06,018
That's totally wrong, but...

514
00:22:06,084 --> 00:22:07,951
I know. I'm so funny, huh?

515
00:22:08,018 --> 00:22:09,217
My best friend, Kimmy, told me

516
00:22:09,283 --> 00:22:10,450
I should totally do more comedy.

517
00:22:10,517 --> 00:22:12,450
She says most people are really uptight,

518
00:22:12,517 --> 00:22:14,118
but I'm not tight at all.

519
00:22:14,183 --> 00:22:15,217
That's what she said.

520
00:22:15,283 --> 00:22:16,884
Who? Oh, Kimmy?

521
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:18,384
Yeah, she said that.

522
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,051
She said I'm so much funnier than Cameron Diaz.

523
00:22:21,118 --> 00:22:23,118
I mean, plus, have you seen my ass?

524
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,517
Come on.

525
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:28,517
Way better than hers.

526
00:22:28,584 --> 00:22:31,417
Like way.

527
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:34,417
Could you excuse us for just...

528
00:22:34,484 --> 00:22:35,584
One minute?

529
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:38,051
Sure. I have to pee, anyway.

530
00:22:38,118 --> 00:22:40,018
Great. Second door on the left.

531
00:22:40,084 --> 00:22:41,751
Okay.

532
00:22:43,317 --> 00:22:46,584
I'll just clean out my things and go.

533
00:22:50,183 --> 00:22:53,084
Remember that time I stayed with you and uncle David

534
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,283
for a whole week?

535
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,150
Yep, and we made pancakes every morning

536
00:22:56,217 --> 00:22:58,051
with chocolate sauce and whipped cream?

537
00:22:58,118 --> 00:23:01,283
Maybe if David comes, we could do that again.

538
00:23:02,417 --> 00:23:03,450
Yeah.

539
00:23:03,517 --> 00:23:05,051
Maybe.

540
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:08,817
Hey, are you sure Skills and lauren

541
00:23:08,884 --> 00:23:09,884
won't be worried about you?

542
00:23:09,951 --> 00:23:11,717
Oh, man!

543
00:23:17,984 --> 00:23:20,417
At least I got your hat.

544
00:23:36,051 --> 00:23:37,884
So, can I talk to you?

545
00:23:37,951 --> 00:23:41,018
Would you like to speak with me or talk to me?

546
00:23:41,084 --> 00:23:43,851
Oh, brother, you are a piece of work.

547
00:23:43,917 --> 00:23:45,951
So, you're excited about my record, right?

548
00:23:46,018 --> 00:23:47,484
John Knight's excited about my record,

549
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,250
which is why you guys want to close Red Bedroom...

550
00:23:49,317 --> 00:23:50,384
to free me up to record?

551
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,283
In part, yes.

552
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,751
If you close Red Bedroom, I'm not gonna make an album.

553
00:23:57,317 --> 00:23:59,118
Haley, you need to remove the emotion from this.

554
00:23:59,183 --> 00:24:01,150
It's a business decision. It's not personal.

555
00:24:01,217 --> 00:24:02,517
It is personal.

556
00:24:02,584 --> 00:24:06,517
Everything about this label is personal...

557
00:24:06,584 --> 00:24:09,250
why Peyton started it, why she made me her partner...

558
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:11,350
It's as personal as it gets.

559
00:24:13,317 --> 00:24:17,417
If you don't record with us, you don't record at all.

560
00:24:17,484 --> 00:24:19,651
We have a contract with you.

561
00:24:19,717 --> 00:24:21,751
We own you.

562
00:24:21,817 --> 00:24:24,951
But you don't own me.

563
00:24:34,717 --> 00:24:35,217
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mia.

564
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,450
I've seen you perform a few times,

565
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,584
but we've never been formally introduced.

566
00:24:39,651 --> 00:24:41,651
Miranda Stone.

567
00:24:41,717 --> 00:24:44,450
Haley's told me a lot about you.

568
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:47,884
Red Bedroom records will always be important to us,

569
00:24:47,951 --> 00:24:49,484
but at the moment...

570
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,484
can we just cut to the chase?

571
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,217
How is Chase?
He's good.

572
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:53,951
He says hi.
Thanks.

573
00:24:54,018 --> 00:24:55,183
Aww, I was there at your first date.

574
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,684
Oh, I know. You and Nathan were so great.

575
00:24:58,651 --> 00:25:00,350
I sold more records

576
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,817
than any artist on our roster last year.

577
00:25:02,884 --> 00:25:05,051
But if this label goes away, so do I.

578
00:25:05,118 --> 00:25:06,450
How so?

579
00:25:06,517 --> 00:25:07,684
You distribute my records,

580
00:25:07,751 --> 00:25:10,283
but I record for Red Bedroom, exclusively.

581
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,784
Peyton made sure of that.

582
00:25:11,851 --> 00:25:12,984
It's true. I checked.

583
00:25:13,051 --> 00:25:15,817
Wow. Everyone has their price.

584
00:25:15,884 --> 00:25:17,684
No, actually, not everyone.

585
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:19,584
Peyton and Haley are responsible for my career,

586
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:21,051
and you can't put a price on that.

587
00:25:21,118 --> 00:25:22,817
And even if you do, I won't accept it.

588
00:25:22,884 --> 00:25:24,884
So, congratulations.

589
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:26,550
You're about to lose your biggest-selling artist.

590
00:25:26,617 --> 00:25:28,018
Does that pretty much do it, Hales?

591
00:25:28,084 --> 00:25:29,584
Yes. Thank you. So good to see you.

592
00:25:29,651 --> 00:25:30,851
Oh, good to see you, too.

593
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:32,917
You look so cute. Thanks.

594
00:25:32,984 --> 00:25:35,784
I'll let you two talk. Yeah?

595
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:41,784
Who's the bitch now, bitch?

596
00:25:43,651 --> 00:25:44,751
I'm so sorry.

597
00:25:44,817 --> 00:25:46,051
I should have met with her first.

598
00:25:46,118 --> 00:25:48,550
I thought she was the girl from her movies.

599
00:25:48,617 --> 00:25:50,018
It's okay. I thought so, too.

600
00:25:50,084 --> 00:25:52,018
She has been in that bathroom a really long time.

601
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,817
What are we gonna do?

602
00:25:53,884 --> 00:25:55,384
I'll tell you what we're not gonna do.

603
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,183
We are not gonna pay that dum-dum $500,000.

604
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,450
We'll just have to... tell her something.

605
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:05,517
We'll say the company went bankrupt or...

606
00:26:05,584 --> 00:26:07,617
Or maybe...

607
00:26:07,684 --> 00:26:09,550
we should just start speaking Spanish

608
00:26:09,617 --> 00:26:12,317
and she'll get really confused and she'll just leave.

609
00:26:12,384 --> 00:26:14,717
I don't think that's gonna work.

610
00:26:14,784 --> 00:26:17,084
It might. She is really dumb.

611
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,617
Brooke?

612
00:26:20,183 --> 00:26:23,517
Buenos dias. Tenido mucha cerveza.

613
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:26,150
Ay, mucha cerveza.

614
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,817
It's okay.

615
00:26:28,884 --> 00:26:32,118
I, uh... I know I'm not what you expected.

616
00:26:32,183 --> 00:26:34,550
You don't have to pay me.

617
00:26:34,617 --> 00:26:37,051
It's just...

618
00:26:40,384 --> 00:26:42,317
that's one of my designs.

619
00:26:42,384 --> 00:26:45,917
Since rehab, this dress is all I have.

620
00:26:45,984 --> 00:26:49,584
When I felt like I was nothing,

621
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:53,350
it gave me strength and dignity.

622
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:56,350
So, no matter what happens to me

623
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:59,183
or where my life takes me,

624
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,217
I'll wear this dress...

625
00:27:01,283 --> 00:27:03,717
your dress...

626
00:27:03,784 --> 00:27:05,917
and I'll be fine.

627
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:15,283
It's okay. Of course we will pay you.

628
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:20,217
I... I think you look beautiful in that dress,

629
00:27:20,283 --> 00:27:22,617
and I think you're gonna be perfect

630
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,283
as the face of the line.

631
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,217
Really?

632
00:27:27,884 --> 00:27:30,684
That is so rad!

633
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:31,417
Oh!

634
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:34,317
Yay!

635
00:27:36,484 --> 00:27:38,317
Hey.

636
00:27:38,384 --> 00:27:40,051
Look at this.

637
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:42,150
It's all over the internet.

638
00:27:42,217 --> 00:27:44,717
The buzz is really positive.

639
00:27:44,784 --> 00:27:47,951
I didn't really have "buzz" in mind.

640
00:27:48,018 --> 00:27:50,584
I know, but that's why you have me.

641
00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:55,851
*I'm here if you need me*

642
00:27:55,917 --> 00:28:00,217
*oh, this way* ...

643
00:28:00,283 --> 00:28:01,817
Well, hi.

644
00:28:01,884 --> 00:28:04,584
What are you doing?

645
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:06,317
Fixing you dinner,

646
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,917
and thinking about getting rid of my poster.

647
00:28:08,984 --> 00:28:10,384
Why?

648
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,684
Because you have to eat and because...

649
00:28:13,751 --> 00:28:14,851
You hate it.

650
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:16,118
I don't hate it.

651
00:28:16,183 --> 00:28:17,984
Yeah.

652
00:28:18,051 --> 00:28:20,751
No, I don't. I just...

653
00:28:20,817 --> 00:28:23,884
I don't really like it there.

654
00:28:23,951 --> 00:28:25,717
It's okay.

655
00:28:34,617 --> 00:28:37,617
My father, as you know, was always gone,

656
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:41,084
always on some distant location or at the office,

657
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,018
you know, making movies.

658
00:28:43,084 --> 00:28:47,617
But this one time, he came home and surprised me

659
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:51,517
and took me to see "the thin red line".

660
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:54,984
And then we spent the rest of the day together,

661
00:28:55,051 --> 00:28:56,984
just him and me.

662
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:03,384
And that didn't happen very often.

663
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,217
Actually, that really never happened again.

664
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:11,118
But that day...

665
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:14,751
that was a good day.

666
00:29:16,384 --> 00:29:19,550
That was probably the best day I ever had with him.

667
00:29:23,018 --> 00:29:27,450
And that was the day I decided
I wanted to make movies, too,

668
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:30,317
like my dad.

669
00:29:30,384 --> 00:29:37,651
*let it disappear into my hand*

670
00:29:37,717 --> 00:29:42,084
*whoa, yeah, my hand*

671
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,118
I appreciate you meeting me.

672
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:46,250
Oh, so now you appreciate me.

673
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,984
What happened to confrontational clay?

674
00:29:49,051 --> 00:29:51,917
I'm confrontational because
I'm protective over Nathan,

675
00:29:51,984 --> 00:29:53,684
and because, of all my clients,

676
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:56,317
he's the last one I'd expect to be in this situation.

677
00:29:56,384 --> 00:29:58,851
And what situation is that?

678
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:00,951
You tell me.

679
00:30:02,784 --> 00:30:04,884
Ask me what's in the envelope.

680
00:30:04,951 --> 00:30:06,450
I'm not here to play games.

681
00:30:07,984 --> 00:30:10,951
The night Nathan scored 35 points against Memphis,

682
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,751
you threw a big party for him after the game.

683
00:30:13,817 --> 00:30:16,784
I should know. I was there.

684
00:30:16,851 --> 00:30:19,951
It got... pretty wild.

685
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,951
Get to the point.

686
00:30:23,018 --> 00:30:27,584
The pictures of what happened
between me and Nathan that night

687
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:29,684
are in the envelope.

688
00:30:29,751 --> 00:30:33,617
Whatever's in that envelope
is meaningless or fabricated,

689
00:30:33,684 --> 00:30:35,183
because we both know

690
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,584
that whatever you're accusing
him of doing, he didn't do.

691
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:41,051
Maybe you should take a look.

692
00:30:57,283 --> 00:30:58,984
I spoke with john knight.

693
00:30:59,051 --> 00:31:00,951
He thinks mia's bluffing,

694
00:31:01,017 --> 00:31:03,717
and he still wants to fold the label.

695
00:31:03,784 --> 00:31:07,383
But I recommended we don't.

696
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,784
Why?

697
00:31:11,851 --> 00:31:15,383
Because integrity and loyalty still matter.

698
00:31:16,851 --> 00:31:20,617
Does that surprise you... that I actually have a heart?

699
00:31:20,684 --> 00:31:22,017
A little.

700
00:31:22,084 --> 00:31:24,151
And besides, I don't think she's bluffing,

701
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,784
and she makes us a lot of money.

702
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,650
If I do this... if...

703
00:31:28,717 --> 00:31:31,684
Your album needs to be finished in the next six months.

704
00:31:35,084 --> 00:31:37,051
Hmm.

705
00:31:37,118 --> 00:31:38,617
Why did Peyton start this label, anyway?

706
00:31:38,684 --> 00:31:39,617
You said it was personal.

707
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:46,383
She thought that major labels were soulless.

708
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,417
We are.

709
00:31:48,484 --> 00:31:50,650
Don't forget it.

710
00:31:50,717 --> 00:31:54,317
*we just don't see it the same way*

711
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:59,550
*but you're never sure*

712
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:04,151
*we can't go on like this anymore*

713
00:32:05,684 --> 00:32:07,484
It's open.

714
00:32:10,151 --> 00:32:12,151
Brooke.

715
00:32:12,218 --> 00:32:14,017
You wanted to speak with me?

716
00:32:16,051 --> 00:32:18,151
You know, my whole life,

717
00:32:18,218 --> 00:32:21,383
I wanted to get my mother to be proud of me.

718
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:23,484
And then one night,

719
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:26,917
Julian threatened to exile her from our lives,

720
00:32:26,984 --> 00:32:29,951
and I would do the same to you.

721
00:32:30,017 --> 00:32:32,184
I'm just not sure it would matter.

722
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,917
You're upset.

723
00:32:34,984 --> 00:32:38,584
I have this poster hanging in my living room, Paul.

724
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,584
Of course I'm upset.

725
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,884
And the only reason that it's hanging there

726
00:32:42,951 --> 00:32:45,751
is because you took him to see that movie,

727
00:32:45,817 --> 00:32:48,184
and for one day

728
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:51,350
that boy felt close to his father.

729
00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:55,218
He felt loved and appreciated.

730
00:32:55,283 --> 00:32:58,550
And the sad part is

731
00:32:58,617 --> 00:33:02,317
that there was only one of those days.

732
00:33:02,383 --> 00:33:04,084
Because in my book,

733
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:09,118
the day that he didn't feel that
way should be the unique one.

734
00:33:09,184 --> 00:33:11,550
Fix it.

735
00:33:11,617 --> 00:33:15,884
*the hardest thing about this is I still care*

736
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:18,118
*you know there's something better*

737
00:33:18,184 --> 00:33:22,584
*for both of us out there*

738
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,884
Hey.

739
00:33:23,951 --> 00:33:26,151
Hey.

740
00:33:26,218 --> 00:33:29,317
' *cause you wait for rain*

741
00:33:30,584 --> 00:33:31,717
How'd it go at the label?

742
00:33:31,784 --> 00:33:33,584
Um...

743
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:36,017
I think I fixed it temporarily.

744
00:33:37,784 --> 00:33:40,717
Now I got to fix my sister.

745
00:33:40,784 --> 00:33:43,084
Did you talk to David?

746
00:33:43,151 --> 00:33:45,917
There's not that much to talk about.

747
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:48,784
We grew apart.

748
00:33:48,851 --> 00:33:51,218
You know, we stopped laughing as much,

749
00:33:51,283 --> 00:33:52,917
stopped caring as much.

750
00:33:54,884 --> 00:33:57,917
Did something happen recently?

751
00:33:57,984 --> 00:34:01,617
One night in New York I went
to go see "Spring awakening"

752
00:34:01,684 --> 00:34:02,984
with some friends.

753
00:34:03,051 --> 00:34:05,051
And after we took the subway

754
00:34:05,118 --> 00:34:08,218
to this ridiculous open-mike night in Brooklyn.

755
00:34:08,283 --> 00:34:10,751
And we watched these horrible performers

756
00:34:10,817 --> 00:34:12,484
who, for whatever reason,

757
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,917
had to get onstage and be seen and heard.

758
00:34:17,383 --> 00:34:19,717
And as I'm watching them,

759
00:34:19,784 --> 00:34:22,350
I'm thinking that I understand them.

760
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:26,084
You know, they... they were
messy and... and unsure

761
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:29,817
and maybe a little confused, but...

762
00:34:29,884 --> 00:34:32,517
but they were doing what they needed to do,

763
00:34:32,584 --> 00:34:35,784
you know, what their hearts needed them to do.

764
00:34:37,717 --> 00:34:40,118
And then David called my cellphone,

765
00:34:40,184 --> 00:34:42,350
and I didn't want to answer.

766
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:43,617
You know, there was a time

767
00:34:43,684 --> 00:34:45,283
when he would have been sitting right there,

768
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,584
and... and I would have loved that.

769
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:51,017
But he hasn't been that guy in a while.

770
00:34:51,084 --> 00:34:53,017
You guys were great together, you know.

771
00:34:53,084 --> 00:34:55,283
I mean, you... you were really happy.

772
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,684
And then one day we weren't.

773
00:34:57,751 --> 00:34:59,350
And I know there's supposed to be

774
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:02,984
some big, huge, important reason why, but there's not.

775
00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:04,650
It's just a feeling that I have

776
00:35:04,717 --> 00:35:07,884
that this isn't what I want
for the rest of my life.

777
00:35:07,951 --> 00:35:09,984
People have a right to change, Quinn.

778
00:35:10,051 --> 00:35:12,717
Yeah, but they also have a right to stay the same.

779
00:35:12,784 --> 00:35:14,984
They have a right to be exactly the person

780
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:16,484
that they've always been.

781
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,917
Okay? I didn't change, Haley. David changed.

782
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:23,417
And now somehow I'm the one
who's broken because of it.

783
00:35:23,484 --> 00:35:25,051
*wait for rain*

784
00:35:25,118 --> 00:35:28,084
*and I chase the stars*

785
00:35:28,151 --> 00:35:29,550
*we just don't see* ...

786
00:35:29,617 --> 00:35:31,617
So, tell me what the worst act was

787
00:35:31,684 --> 00:35:33,517
that you saw that open-mike night.

788
00:35:35,184 --> 00:35:36,151
Come on.

789
00:35:38,617 --> 00:35:40,984
There was this really angry guy

790
00:35:41,051 --> 00:35:43,617
who sang "Cat's in the cradle".

791
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:46,684
Yeah, I swear he was a serial killer.

792
00:35:48,584 --> 00:35:50,051
When he got done, everyone clapped,

793
00:35:50,118 --> 00:35:52,017
and he, like, sneered at the people who didn't.

794
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:56,517
I guarantee you they're missing right now.

795
00:35:56,584 --> 00:36:00,151
*I chase the stars*

796
00:36:00,218 --> 00:36:02,884
I miss you, Haley-Bob.

797
00:36:02,951 --> 00:36:05,250
I miss you, too.

798
00:36:05,317 --> 00:36:08,917
*bring on the wrecking ball*

799
00:36:08,984 --> 00:36:11,051
You're not broken.

800
00:36:12,984 --> 00:36:15,383
Thanks.

801
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:17,250
I hope not.

802
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:26,151
Hi, son.

803
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:28,417
I was just...

804
00:36:28,484 --> 00:36:30,717
heading back to L.A. and I wanted to...

805
00:36:30,784 --> 00:36:32,484
say goodbye.

806
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,218
Okay.

807
00:36:35,283 --> 00:36:36,684
Listen...

808
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:38,218
I came here to tell you

809
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:40,817
that I think you're wrong
to put your relationship

810
00:36:40,884 --> 00:36:43,851
before your career, but...

811
00:36:45,784 --> 00:36:47,984
... I think it's me who's been wrong.

812
00:36:49,784 --> 00:36:52,317
I wasn't around enough.

813
00:36:52,383 --> 00:36:54,851
And...

814
00:36:54,917 --> 00:36:56,283
I was too busy

815
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:59,084
caring for fictional characters

816
00:36:59,151 --> 00:37:02,984
instead of caring for the real ones in my life.

817
00:37:03,051 --> 00:37:05,017
You did fine, dad.

818
00:37:05,084 --> 00:37:11,250
*there's just too much, my, my*

819
00:37:11,317 --> 00:37:13,317
That poster...

820
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:18,817
that was a good day for us?

821
00:37:18,884 --> 00:37:20,584
The best.

822
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:26,051
*my heart's as cold as ice*

823
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,450
I don't remember it.

824
00:37:31,317 --> 00:37:32,550
I'm sorry.

825
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,550
It's okay.

826
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:35,684
No, it's not.

827
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,650
I'm proud of you, son.

828
00:37:43,017 --> 00:37:45,784
You go live your life and...

829
00:37:45,851 --> 00:37:47,617
Be happy.

830
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,250
And whatever you do, don't be like me, okay?

831
00:37:54,717 --> 00:37:56,317
I'll see you.

832
00:37:58,751 --> 00:38:01,851
*the word that I breathe is a word that I need*

833
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:05,417
*and the songs that I sing don't mean anything*

834
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:07,184
*don't you wonder*

835
00:38:09,984 --> 00:38:14,751
*why it's always been this way* ?

836
00:38:17,151 --> 00:38:21,517
*all our innocence is gone*

837
00:38:21,584 --> 00:38:24,184
What'd she say?

838
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:27,417
That night after your big game against Memphis,

839
00:38:27,484 --> 00:38:28,784
we had that party.

840
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:34,650
We got pretty wasted that night.

841
00:38:34,717 --> 00:38:37,051
Yeah. So?

842
00:38:37,118 --> 00:38:40,317
Well, that was three months ago.

843
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:45,350
*if you like, I'll take the blame*

844
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:54,118
*for all the things that you have done*

845
00:38:54,184 --> 00:38:56,717
She's three months pregnant, nate.

846
00:38:56,784 --> 00:38:59,184
*my songs*

847
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:03,417
*on a cold night*

848
00:39:03,484 --> 00:39:06,751
*I can't get you out* ...

849
00:39:06,817 --> 00:39:08,684
And where will you run...

850
00:39:08,751 --> 00:39:10,884
back to the life of a peasant harlot?

851
00:39:10,951 --> 00:39:12,684
Perhaps I will.

852
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:15,051
But should I return to a life of more meager means,

853
00:39:15,118 --> 00:39:17,383
I will do so with my dignity intact...

854
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,151
She's good in this. You were right.

855
00:39:19,218 --> 00:39:21,283
... my heart pure and true.

856
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,417
What?

857
00:39:23,984 --> 00:39:26,817
I love you. You know that?

858
00:39:26,884 --> 00:39:29,584
I love who you are.

859
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:33,383
I don't know how you got there, but I'm glad you did.

860
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:36,851
I'm glad I did, too, 'cause you're here with me.

861
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:39,684
Meager means, indeed.

862
00:39:39,751 --> 00:39:42,151
Mmm. Come here.

863
00:39:42,218 --> 00:39:43,951
Harlot!

864
00:39:45,317 --> 00:39:47,650
Leave the dress!

865
00:39:47,717 --> 00:39:49,751
This dress is all I have.

866
00:39:49,817 --> 00:39:52,151
When I felt like I was nothing,

867
00:39:52,218 --> 00:39:54,751
It gave me strength and dignity.

868
00:39:54,817 --> 00:39:56,450
So, no matter what happens to me

869
00:39:56,517 --> 00:39:58,650
Or where my life takes me,

870
00:39:58,717 --> 00:40:01,917
I'll wear this dress, and I'll be fine.

871
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:23,984
I read your book.

872
00:40:24,051 --> 00:40:26,283
Did it help?

873
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:28,617
It did when I sold it.

874
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,884
How you doing?

875
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:53,250
Better now.

876
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:56,051
I had such a crummy day.

877
00:40:56,118 --> 00:40:57,650
Yeah?

878
00:40:57,717 --> 00:40:59,383
Uh-Huh.

879
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,984
Well, I think it's about to get worse.

880
00:41:05,751 --> 00:41:07,751
Why?

881
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:13,517
I have something I need to tell you.

882
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:16,484
*my love*

883
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:20,517
*is a young love*

884
00:41:20,584 --> 00:41:27,257
*but I know we'll get this right*

885
00:41:27,257 --> 00:41:31,539
