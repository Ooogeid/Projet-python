00:00:01,866 --> 00:00:03,494
<i>My name is Lucas Scott.</i>

2
00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:07,033
<i>Four years ago, I graduated from
high school with my friends,</i>

3
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:09,093
<i>and we all went
our separate ways.</i>

4
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:12,643
<i>Recently, we've all come home.</i>

5
00:00:13,636 --> 00:00:16,106
<i>My ex-girlfriend Peyton is
starting a new record label...</i>

6
00:00:16,206 --> 00:00:19,062
So we're gonna give you a chance.
Don't let us down.

7
00:00:19,304 --> 00:00:20,312
I won't.

8
00:00:20,412 --> 00:00:23,024
<i>...and getting to know my
new girlfriend, Lindsey...</i>

9
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:25,093
<i>- sort of.</i>
- Peyton, hi.

10
00:00:25,198 --> 00:00:26,900
You just missed Lucas.

11
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:29,216
Yeah, actually,
I came here to see you.

12
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:32,625
But for the record,
I'm not after Lucas, okay?

13
00:00:32,726 --> 00:00:34,837
<i>Haley just hired a nanny
for her son, Jamie.</i>

14
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:37,462
Look, mama.
Me and daddy made mud.

15
00:00:37,568 --> 00:00:40,352
I'm sorry. Who am I kidding?
How soon could you start?

16
00:00:41,277 --> 00:00:43,713
<i>Because her husband, Nathan's,
been in a wheelchair,</i>

17
00:00:43,818 --> 00:00:46,792
<i>but now seems to be recovering
in more ways than one.</i>

18
00:00:46,895 --> 00:00:50,482
- What is this?
- I figure it's a start, right?

19
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,722
I've really missed you.

20
00:00:53,986 --> 00:00:55,872
<i>Mouth started a job...</i>

21
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:59,182
<i>and other things with
his new boss, Alice.</i>

22
00:00:59,786 --> 00:01:02,522
<i>Brooke opened a local
store for her fashion line,</i>

23
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:05,670
<i>but she also found that sometimes
your problems follow you home.</i>

24
00:01:05,778 --> 00:01:07,091
What are you doing here?

25
00:01:07,196 --> 00:01:10,372
Vacation's over.
It's time to get back to work.

26
00:01:10,476 --> 00:01:12,160
No. I'm not going back.

27
00:01:12,268 --> 00:01:14,140
- Brooke.
- Mother.

28
00:01:15,656 --> 00:01:18,453
I'll see you on the plane,
my dutiful daughter.

29
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:20,993
<i>Like I said,
we're all home now,</i>

30
00:01:21,098 --> 00:01:23,771
<i>maybe hoping that the
things we were looking for</i>

31
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:26,182
<i>were right here in
Tree Hill all along.</i>

34
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:43,700
Heya, roomie.

35
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:47,983
So, I've got a plan on
how we deal with Victoria.

36
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:49,383
- Really?
- Ready?

37
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:52,030
I'll get the shovel,
and you get 10 feet of rope.

38
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:54,580
- Too much?
- Maybe.

39
00:01:55,187 --> 00:01:56,552
And what about you?

40
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:59,411
Don't you have a band to turn
into rock stars or something?

41
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:02,141
Yes. Today is our
first day in-studio.

42
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:04,602
I've got to do some other
stuff beforehand, though.

43
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,140
Okay.

44
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:07,672
Good luck.

45
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:11,013
Brooke.

46
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:13,593
You're doing great.

47
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,992
<i>Much as some of us fight it,</i>

48
00:02:23,437 --> 00:02:26,303
<i>our parents have a
mystical hold over us--</i>

49
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:32,052
<i>the power to affect our thoughts
and emotions the way only they can.</i>

50
00:02:32,258 --> 00:02:34,882
<i>It's a bond that
changes over time</i>

51
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:37,110
<i>but doesn't diminish,</i>

52
00:02:37,316 --> 00:02:39,691
<i>even if they're half
a world away...</i>

53
00:02:44,677 --> 00:02:46,980
<i>...or in another
world entirely.</i>

54
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:52,351
<i>It's a power we never
fully understand.</i>

55
00:02:53,118 --> 00:02:54,981
<i>We're left only to wonder</i>

56
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:57,202
<i>that when our time comes,</i>

57
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:01,510
<i>what kind of hold will
we have on our children?</i>

58
00:03:04,377 --> 00:03:06,462
Daddy, can we play
ball again? Now?

59
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:08,623
No, not right now, sweetie.
Maybe later.

60
00:03:08,726 --> 00:03:09,751
Thank you.

61
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:12,371
I want to play every day.
He shoots. He scores.

62
00:03:12,478 --> 00:03:14,813
Straight to the hole, playas.

63
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:18,412
Okay. I guess we got to stop
leaving him with Skills.

64
00:03:18,697 --> 00:03:21,781
Come on, champ.
There's a bath with your name on it.

65
00:03:29,216 --> 00:03:30,733
So how are you doing?

66
00:03:32,077 --> 00:03:35,133
I'm trying.
There's good days and bad days, right?

67
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:37,321
It's a good thing we don't
have to worry about money,

68
00:03:37,357 --> 00:03:39,722
but I got to figure
out what I'm gonna do.

69
00:03:39,827 --> 00:03:41,803
Not all of us can have it
together all the time.

70
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:43,132
If you only knew.

71
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:44,821
I thought you had
those kids in line.

72
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:46,871
You remember Quentin?
The one that walked out

73
00:03:46,975 --> 00:03:48,473
after I threatened
to fail him?

74
00:03:48,575 --> 00:03:51,642
Next thing I know,
he got cut from the basketball team

75
00:03:51,747 --> 00:03:53,561
and he stopped
showing up at school.

76
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,530
- That's not your fault.
- Yeah, but I'm a teacher.

77
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,622
I'm supposed to be saving these kids,
not running them off.

78
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:02,441
I tried to talk with him,
but he wouldn't listen to me.

79
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:05,620
Oh, maybe if he...

80
00:04:05,976 --> 00:04:08,750
had somebody he
could relate to.

81
00:04:08,855 --> 00:04:10,563
Whatever you're thinking,
stop it.

82
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:11,642
Come on.

83
00:04:11,748 --> 00:04:15,033
Haley, I'm the last person that
should be giving anybody a talk.

84
00:04:15,308 --> 00:04:19,220
You're, like, a basketball God
or something to these guys.

85
00:04:19,328 --> 00:04:22,321
And you're not a teacher,
which will really help.

86
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:24,872
I think he might listen to you.

87
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:29,501
- All right. I'll think about it.
- Thank you.

88
00:04:29,605 --> 00:04:31,932
For what it's worth, I think it
might give you another good day.

89
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:33,553
- Really?
- Yeah.

90
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:36,132
So, are you bringing back the mullet,
or what?

91
00:04:41,858 --> 00:04:45,111
You know, you're really hot when you're
not yelling about how much I suck.

92
00:04:46,378 --> 00:04:48,011
See you at work.

93
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:51,492
- Don't be late, okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

94
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:08,002
- Do you ever knock?
- What's that?

95
00:05:09,335 --> 00:05:11,251
- I don't smell anything.
- Perfume.

96
00:05:11,356 --> 00:05:15,723
Yeah, Chanel 5 elixir --
choice of a classy older woman.

97
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:22,392
Ooh! Claw marks! Somebody
tussled with a cougar last night!

98
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:23,452
You're out of your mind.

99
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,500
It was your boss lady,
wasn't it?

100
00:05:25,947 --> 00:05:29,222
Damn, I knew it!
Office dragon lady by day,

101
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:31,632
sex machine to entry-level
chumps by night.

102
00:05:31,738 --> 00:05:33,082
I don't know what
you're talking about.

103
00:05:33,117 --> 00:05:35,832
My boy,
you need to ask for a raise!

104
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:45,213
Okay, guys. We open in a day,

105
00:05:45,316 --> 00:05:48,750
so how is it possible that
the light panel doesn't work?

106
00:05:49,258 --> 00:05:51,190
I don't see luggage.

107
00:05:56,136 --> 00:06:00,282
So... this is why
you disappeared

108
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:03,933
from your work and your
life and your family--

109
00:06:04,535 --> 00:06:08,011
for a half-built shop in the
middle of a half-dead town.

110
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:10,190
Don't say that.
Tree Hill's home.

111
00:06:10,296 --> 00:06:12,433
Not anymore. Get in the car.

112
00:06:12,535 --> 00:06:13,880
- No.
- Brooke--

113
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:16,193
Just listen to me, please.

114
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:21,711
For the last couple of years,
you have told me

115
00:06:21,818 --> 00:06:24,772
what to do, who to date,
what to say.

116
00:06:24,876 --> 00:06:28,362
And I've let you because you are the
brains behind this whole operation.

117
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:30,002
And the company didn't
seem to suffer.

118
00:06:30,105 --> 00:06:32,210
I agree, and I am grateful,

119
00:06:32,406 --> 00:06:37,110
but I've learned a lot,
and I know that I can do this.

120
00:06:37,217 --> 00:06:39,823
Just give me a chance
to prove it to you.

121
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:48,801
All right.

122
00:06:50,028 --> 00:06:51,453
All right.

123
00:06:51,635 --> 00:06:54,010
I can't force you to
go back to New York.

124
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:59,290
If this is what you really want,
I'll respect your decision.

125
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:02,530
Thank you.

126
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:06,202
I should commend you for
opening a shop yourself.

127
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:11,181
Just dealing with the inventory,
the catering, and the publicity...

128
00:07:12,095 --> 00:07:15,260
but I'm sure you've taken
care of all that by now.

129
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:17,292
Of course.

130
00:07:27,205 --> 00:07:28,952
Millicent? Hi. It's me.

131
00:07:29,058 --> 00:07:30,963
I need your help.

132
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:40,930
What brings the great Nathan
Scott around here, huh?

133
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:42,700
Checking out the
next big thing?

134
00:07:42,806 --> 00:07:46,622
That crossover wouldn't work in the
NBA or college, but it's not bad.

135
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:48,082
Yeah. You got any suggestions?

136
00:07:48,186 --> 00:07:49,561
Could try the fadeaway.

137
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,212
The fadeaway's weak.

138
00:07:53,927 --> 00:07:55,091
So...

139
00:07:56,568 --> 00:07:59,373
...I heard you mixed it
up back in your day, huh?

140
00:07:59,476 --> 00:08:03,322
Girls. Bookies.
A little point-shaving.

141
00:08:03,425 --> 00:08:05,103
That was a long
time ago, Quentin.

142
00:08:05,205 --> 00:08:07,202
Oh, you ain't got to explain
nothing to me, playa.

143
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:09,080
People like you and me, man,

144
00:08:09,481 --> 00:08:11,196
we're just misunderstood.

145
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:13,915
Is that why you
dropped out of school?

146
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:15,557
Teachers didn't get you?

147
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:18,992
You should be thankful.

148
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:21,580
One more year,
I'd have broke your scoring record.

149
00:08:24,245 --> 00:08:26,600
Maybe there's something
we can do about that.

150
00:08:34,856 --> 00:08:38,172
Why do you always look extra sexy
right before you're about to leave?

151
00:08:38,277 --> 00:08:41,202
Oh, because I'm mean like that.

152
00:08:41,498 --> 00:08:44,063
I'll be back from
New York late sunday.

153
00:08:44,686 --> 00:08:47,121
Try and stay out of
trouble while I'm gone.

154
00:08:47,225 --> 00:08:49,610
Come on. What kind of trouble
could I get in without you?

155
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:54,571
Hi.

156
00:08:56,455 --> 00:08:58,132
Change of plans.

157
00:09:04,838 --> 00:09:06,691
That was a joke. Sorry.

158
00:09:06,798 --> 00:09:08,941
It's okay. I deserve it.

159
00:09:09,347 --> 00:09:11,840
Lucas is getting dressed,
but he'll be out in a sec.

160
00:09:11,948 --> 00:09:14,240
Actually, I wanted to
apologize for yesterday.

161
00:09:14,347 --> 00:09:16,681
You were being nice,
and I got bitchy and weird,

162
00:09:16,785 --> 00:09:19,992
- and I'm really sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

163
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:21,420
Okay.

164
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,352
Anyway, Brooke's having
her store opening tomorrow,

165
00:09:25,457 --> 00:09:27,443
and I didn't know if maybe
you wanted to go together.

166
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:31,021
We could go get dinner beforehand and--
clean slate, you know?

167
00:09:31,128 --> 00:09:34,341
I'd love to, but I'm about to
hop on a plane to New York.

168
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,443
Actually, Lucas is going.
You two should go together.

169
00:09:37,545 --> 00:09:40,111
He hates going to
those things alone.

170
00:09:41,876 --> 00:09:43,523
I couldn't. I'm sorry.

171
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,832
Honestly, I would just feel way
too guilty after how I behaved.

172
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:49,030
I know. I'm counting on it.

173
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:51,771
Besides, you'd have to be a pretty
awful person to do what you did

174
00:09:51,797 --> 00:09:54,603
and then hit on my boyfriend
while I'm out of town.

175
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:58,671
Like you said, clean slate.

176
00:09:59,406 --> 00:10:00,832
You two have fun.

177
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:09,773
Nathan Scott--
standing up and looking good.

178
00:10:10,565 --> 00:10:11,871
How's it going?

179
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:15,243
You know-- everybody expecting us to
turn this thing around this season,

180
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,013
so the pressure's on.

181
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,160
If anybody can do it,
it's you and Lucas.

182
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:20,720
True dat.

183
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,102
But we ain't miracle workers.

184
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,630
Hey, little bro.
You look great.

185
00:10:27,736 --> 00:10:29,241
Feel terrible.

186
00:10:30,226 --> 00:10:32,703
I just wanted to thank you for
being there for Haley and Jamie.

187
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:34,292
Don't worry about it.

188
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:39,852
So, you here to teach these
kids how to win a championship?

189
00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:42,083
I have an idea on
where to start.

190
00:10:42,327 --> 00:10:44,140
You could put Quentin
back on the team.

191
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:47,401
Haley put you up to this.

192
00:10:47,507 --> 00:10:49,281
She's got a thing
for lost causes.

193
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:51,183
And I watched the kid play.
He's really good.

194
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,501
I'm not saying the kid
doesn't have talent.

195
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:57,172
The fact is,
I don't have time to coach him

196
00:10:57,277 --> 00:11:00,502
or deal with his crap or teach
him to play an unselfish game.

197
00:11:00,608 --> 00:11:02,463
Okay. What if I did?

198
00:11:03,517 --> 00:11:05,592
You're gonna come to practice?

199
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:08,192
Every practice?

200
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:10,463
Every day, five days a week?

201
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:12,223
If that's what it takes.

202
00:11:14,538 --> 00:11:15,832
All right.

203
00:11:16,838 --> 00:11:19,711
I'll do it for you,
but not for him.

204
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:23,121
- Welcome back, Nate.
- Thanks, man.

205
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:26,032
All right. Three-man weave.
Line it up.

206
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:45,253
He, guys! Guys! That's great.
That sounds really good.

207
00:11:45,355 --> 00:11:48,103
Jason, maybe this time,
let's play a little bit slower.

208
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,382
I think it'll make it more intense,
you know?

209
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:52,673
- Sure thing.
- Cool.

210
00:12:04,897 --> 00:12:06,953
Hey, guys, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

211
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:08,713
I think that's the same tempo.

212
00:12:08,818 --> 00:12:10,321
Yeah, it is.

213
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,400
All right.
Maybe I wasn't clear.

214
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:14,661
Look, these are
my songs, Peyton.

215
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:18,300
We play them my way.
Nobody's gonna change that.

216
00:12:22,688 --> 00:12:24,801
Hi. I'm so sorry I'm late.

217
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:26,183
- Hi, mom.
- Hi, baby.

218
00:12:26,285 --> 00:12:27,652
Ooh, I love you.

219
00:12:27,757 --> 00:12:30,541
I had a mountain of papers to grade.
I just have a couple more rands to run,

220
00:12:30,576 --> 00:12:32,343
and then I'll take
Jamie out of your hair.

221
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:35,712
Actually, I saw your to-do list on
the fridge and thought I'd help out.

222
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:38,650
I picked up the dry cleaning.
Nathan's prescription's on the counter.

223
00:12:38,755 --> 00:12:41,961
And we baked dairy-free brownies
for Jamie's playdate with Chuck.

224
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:43,813
He's lactose-intolerant.

225
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:47,381
Yes, he is. I totally spaced
about his playdate. I'm so sorry.

226
00:12:47,488 --> 00:12:49,512
Don't sweat it.
That's what I'm here for.

227
00:12:49,618 --> 00:12:51,570
Have a lactose-free afternoon.

228
00:12:51,678 --> 00:12:54,172
- Bye, mama.
- Bye.

229
00:12:57,658 --> 00:12:59,490
All right, guys.
Let's pick up the pace, please.

230
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:01,921
We're shorthanded as it is.
Thank you.

231
00:13:02,588 --> 00:13:06,442
Well, well... you know, this morning
I was half expecting you to disown me.

232
00:13:06,546 --> 00:13:09,463
Oh, Brooke,
I want what's best for you.

233
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:11,432
Someday you'll realize that.

234
00:13:11,535 --> 00:13:15,641
So, what can I do?
I'm offering my help if you want it.

235
00:13:15,745 --> 00:13:18,203
Good God. What is that?

236
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:22,193
That is my assistant Millicent.

237
00:13:22,295 --> 00:13:25,821
Tell me again why you have an assistant
who dresses like a slavic bag lady.

238
00:13:25,928 --> 00:13:27,632
Stop it. She's great.

239
00:13:27,737 --> 00:13:31,180
And what you can do to help
me is do inventory with her.

240
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:36,513
Hi, Victoria.
I'm really excited to be here.

241
00:13:36,618 --> 00:13:39,241
Call the New York office. I want
the latest couture line brought in.

242
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,832
Absolutely. How many pieces?

243
00:13:40,937 --> 00:13:42,380
All of them.

244
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:44,561
- But why--
- Go!

245
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:50,302
I just don't understand how someone
who can write such soulful songs

246
00:13:50,405 --> 00:13:52,571
can be such a dick, you know?

247
00:13:53,447 --> 00:13:54,783
These are awesome.

248
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:56,592
At least the band sounds good,
you know?

249
00:13:56,695 --> 00:13:59,500
Yeah, but something's not right,
you know?

250
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,740
I mean, they have magic, but...

251
00:14:03,707 --> 00:14:05,531
Anyway, I know you're
super swamped,

252
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:08,783
but if I can borrow you
for like two hours...

253
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:10,920
Hales, you should do it.

254
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:14,893
I don't know.
I've got the housework and Jamie.

255
00:14:14,995 --> 00:14:18,173
Oh, yeah. It's too bad we don't
have somebody to take care of that,

256
00:14:18,277 --> 00:14:20,522
like-- I don't know--
maybe a nanny?

257
00:14:20,748 --> 00:14:22,162
Just go.

258
00:14:23,675 --> 00:14:25,070
Okay.

259
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:27,010
Cool.

260
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,580
You wanted to see me?

261
00:14:36,447 --> 00:14:37,910
Close the door.

262
00:14:45,788 --> 00:14:48,181
Let me guess, huh?

263
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,883
You want me back, right?

264
00:14:50,986 --> 00:14:52,353
Take your feet off my desk.

265
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:54,113
Oh, man, I get it.

266
00:14:54,217 --> 00:14:57,120
Local boy becomes coach,
feels pressure to win big,

267
00:14:57,227 --> 00:14:59,532
needs a star player
to make it happen.

268
00:15:00,376 --> 00:15:02,521
Yeah, I guess
I could help you out.

269
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,603
Let me tell you
how it's gonna go.

270
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:11,280
I'm the coach. You do what I say,
and I do not ask you twice.

271
00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:14,890
For instance, there's the
matter of your feet on my desk.

272
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:22,720
I'm building a team.
You play your part

273
00:15:22,826 --> 00:15:25,300
and do as I say
or you are gone.

274
00:15:26,665 --> 00:15:28,633
Just so we're clear.

275
00:15:28,738 --> 00:15:30,751
We both know I'm the best
shooting guard in the state,

276
00:15:30,856 --> 00:15:33,651
so why don't we just
cut the crap, huh?

277
00:15:34,826 --> 00:15:37,020
I'm not playing
no zone defense.

278
00:15:37,126 --> 00:15:39,373
Matter of fact,
I might not play no defense at all.

279
00:15:39,475 --> 00:15:41,993
And on offense, I need my minutes,
so I'm'a play when I want

280
00:15:42,096 --> 00:15:45,280
and I'm'a sit when I want.
And that weak-ass point guard?

281
00:15:45,387 --> 00:15:47,532
Find somebody that's gonna
feed me the ball, man.

282
00:15:47,638 --> 00:15:49,580
You do that,
you can stand on the sideline,

283
00:15:49,686 --> 00:15:51,673
hold your little clipboard,
and watch me work.

284
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:55,743
And when we win,
I might even let you take the credit.

285
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,850
Oh, you can call me "Q," coach.

286
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:06,912
I like you, man, but, uh,
that's how it's gonna go.

287
00:16:07,248 --> 00:16:09,113
Just so we're clear.

288
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,650
Yeah. You're right.

289
00:16:22,758 --> 00:16:26,333
I mean, they're definitely raw,
but there's something there.

290
00:16:26,436 --> 00:16:27,461
Yeah.

291
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:31,493
- Do you mind if I--
- No. Be my guest.

292
00:16:31,597 --> 00:16:34,303
Just watch out
for Jason. He's...

293
00:16:36,297 --> 00:16:37,561
That's Jason.

294
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:40,763
You guys sound amazing.
The hook is really great.

295
00:16:40,968 --> 00:16:44,300
I think this might be a
little repetitive, just...

296
00:16:45,026 --> 00:16:47,771
...over and over, and if you try
and alternate the verses

297
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,470
with something just
even as simple as--

298
00:16:53,718 --> 00:16:55,380
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

299
00:16:55,508 --> 00:16:59,290
That's great but if it's all the same
to you, I think we'll do it my way.

300
00:16:59,398 --> 00:17:01,710
- Well, I'm really liking this.
- Oh, you're talking now?

301
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:04,092
Thought your lesbian girlfriend
was calling the shots.

302
00:17:04,196 --> 00:17:07,443
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to step on you creatively.

303
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:10,412
- I just have some experience--
- Playing the church organ?

304
00:17:10,518 --> 00:17:12,491
Actually, she's had
a major record deal

305
00:17:12,595 --> 00:17:15,192
and a billboard hit and
a sold-out national tour,

306
00:17:15,297 --> 00:17:17,711
whereas you are the lead singer
of a band

307
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:19,511
that plays
for free beer in dive bars.

308
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:22,263
So yes,
you could benefit from her.

309
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:24,493
Whatever. I'm taking
a smoke break.

310
00:17:24,598 --> 00:17:27,503
No, Jason.
You have one hour left in the studio.

311
00:17:32,898 --> 00:17:38,070
So, Mouth,
saw you coming out of Alice's office.

312
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:39,751
You did?

313
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:42,922
Boy, she must have
really worked you over.

314
00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:46,710
Hey, man, hey--
don't let it get to you, okay?

315
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,510
Alice hates everyone.

316
00:17:48,815 --> 00:17:52,843
Look, we got a good, solid crew here,
but you'd never know it.

317
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,471
Not the way she tears into us.

318
00:17:54,578 --> 00:17:56,961
Yeah, she does like
calling the shots.

319
00:17:57,065 --> 00:18:00,270
Yeah, well, she's lucky
she's so hot, huh?

320
00:18:02,085 --> 00:18:05,930
You know, I just wish someone
would stand up to her someday.

321
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:19,492
I'm really sorry about Jason.

322
00:18:19,776 --> 00:18:23,592
It's okay. I've worked with
self-centered musicians before.

323
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:26,813
- Chris Keller ring a bell?
- Only his own.

324
00:18:30,716 --> 00:18:33,763
You know, if you're open to it,

325
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:35,813
I'd really like to
work with them.

326
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,741
Like produce the record?

327
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:41,391
- Aren't you kind of busy?
- Yeah, a few days ago I was.

328
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:45,072
But then Carrie came around and
I actually had time to think.

329
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:48,360
You know what I realized?
I'm 21 years old.

330
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:50,343
Nathan and I got married
and had Jamie so young,

331
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,251
and it feels like we
already lived our lives,

332
00:18:52,356 --> 00:18:54,921
but we're just starting
out like everybody else is.

333
00:18:55,027 --> 00:18:57,000
And just because I'm a wife
and a mother and a teacher,

334
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,980
it doesn't mean I can't
achieve some self-transcendence

335
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:02,361
- by doing something else that I love.
- Well, guess what.

336
00:19:02,396 --> 00:19:04,453
Job's yours,
so calm down, okay?

337
00:19:04,557 --> 00:19:06,022
Thank you very much.

338
00:19:06,127 --> 00:19:08,070
All right, guys.
Come and get it.

339
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,880
Now, words cannot express

340
00:19:12,988 --> 00:19:15,723
how much I appreciate you all
being here on a friday night

341
00:19:15,827 --> 00:19:19,342
doing manual labor,
so I'm just gonna say this--

342
00:19:19,446 --> 00:19:21,650
do not get food
on the clothes.

343
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:24,321
Millicent will be distributing
handi wipes-- use them.

344
00:19:24,428 --> 00:19:27,360
Break's over in 20 minutes,
and I love you all.

345
00:19:29,045 --> 00:19:31,761
It's good to see that success
and fame hasn't changed her.

346
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:34,233
You should have seen
her at cheer camp.

347
00:19:34,737 --> 00:19:36,381
Hey, how's the new band going?

348
00:19:36,487 --> 00:19:39,741
I thought it was gonna be all
good times and groovy tunes,

349
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:43,791
and nobody warned me about obnoxious,
self-righteous musicians.

350
00:19:43,895 --> 00:19:48,002
You've always been capable of a lot more
than you've given yourself credit for.

351
00:19:51,386 --> 00:19:52,952
So, what do you think?

352
00:19:54,105 --> 00:19:57,460
Truthfully, this afternoon
I didn't think it could be done.

353
00:19:57,568 --> 00:20:00,251
But somehow,
you have pulled it off.

354
00:20:00,357 --> 00:20:02,471
You should feel very proud.

355
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:05,321
I'm glad you're here for this.

356
00:20:05,636 --> 00:20:07,112
Me too.

357
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:13,173
Hi, Mrs. Davis.

358
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:15,310
I just want to tell you
I think it's really great

359
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,070
you're supporting Brooke's
decision to stay.

360
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,873
I know it means so much to her.

361
00:20:19,976 --> 00:20:21,841
Of course I support
my daughter.

362
00:20:22,706 --> 00:20:24,540
But let's be clear.

363
00:20:25,347 --> 00:20:28,470
The only reason that Brooke
returned to this backwater town

364
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:31,881
is because her loser friend
couldn't cut it in Los Angeles.

365
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:35,202
That's why I'm here--
to make sure that my daughter

366
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:38,352
is not completely exploited by
her parasitic so-called friend.

367
00:20:38,457 --> 00:20:42,921
So you get your little act together
before you ruin her life, too.

368
00:21:21,007 --> 00:21:24,122
Wow, Mia. That's really great.
Did you write it?

369
00:21:24,226 --> 00:21:26,753
Oh, it doesn't matter.

370
00:21:26,858 --> 00:21:28,740
Jason writes all our songs.

371
00:21:28,848 --> 00:21:30,862
Has the band
ever played it?

372
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:34,242
Really, it's --
it's nothing, you know?

373
00:21:34,347 --> 00:21:37,131
Jason writes all
our stuff, so...

374
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:46,253
Four passes before you shoot.
Four passes before you shoot.

375
00:21:53,828 --> 00:21:57,230
What y'all gonna do about that?
Yeah, that's right-- nothing.

376
00:21:58,115 --> 00:21:59,721
That's for you, playa.

377
00:22:04,998 --> 00:22:07,743
- He's all yours.
- Jeez.

378
00:22:07,887 --> 00:22:09,412
Can I cut him?

379
00:22:13,807 --> 00:22:15,451
The store looks
really great, Brooke.

380
00:22:15,557 --> 00:22:17,531
I can't believe your friends
pulled an all-nighter.

381
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:19,313
I know.
They're pretty wonderful.

382
00:22:19,417 --> 00:22:21,852
But I bet you have friends
who'd do the same for you.

383
00:22:21,956 --> 00:22:24,263
I don't have a lot of
real friends in New York.

384
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:26,460
Yeah. Well, neither do I.

385
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,391
Now, I have a question.

386
00:22:28,496 --> 00:22:32,102
There's a lot more high-end stuff in
the store than I remember ordering.

387
00:22:32,205 --> 00:22:33,702
- Did we--
- Actually, Victoria--

388
00:22:33,806 --> 00:22:36,891
Victoria asked you to fix
the window display yesterday.

389
00:22:36,998 --> 00:22:39,673
A little less chit-chat,
a little more work, yes?

390
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:43,411
She's very frumpy.
We should fire her.

391
00:22:43,517 --> 00:22:44,911
Stop.

392
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:48,461
Hey, if you cannot
fix this crappy feed,

393
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:50,800
then pick up your next check
at the unemployment office.

394
00:22:50,858 --> 00:22:52,491
It's not his fault.

395
00:22:57,498 --> 00:22:59,373
What was that?

396
00:23:01,288 --> 00:23:03,741
It's not his fault
the feed's off.

397
00:23:03,845 --> 00:23:06,401
If you'd let people here do their
jobs right in the first place,

398
00:23:06,457 --> 00:23:08,230
maybe things would run better.

399
00:23:09,966 --> 00:23:12,262
In my office.

400
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:27,031
Never talk back to me in
front of the crew again.

401
00:23:27,788 --> 00:23:30,272
But that was kind of hot.

402
00:23:40,207 --> 00:23:42,161
If it ain't my biggest fan.

403
00:23:42,448 --> 00:23:44,632
You need to start listening
to your coaches, Quentin.

404
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:46,611
They need me more than
I need them, man.

405
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:49,992
Only reason you're back on that team
is because I'm vouching for you.

406
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:52,001
I don't remember asking
you for no help.

407
00:23:52,107 --> 00:23:56,362
Hey... I get it, okay?

408
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:58,863
I used to be just
like you, Quentin.

409
00:23:58,968 --> 00:23:59,690
Okay.

410
00:23:59,797 --> 00:24:01,831
But it's not gonna
help you win games.

411
00:24:01,937 --> 00:24:04,930
More importantly, it's not gonna help
your relationships with other people.

412
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:06,293
Other people?

413
00:24:06,395 --> 00:24:08,592
Who needs other people
when you got this?

414
00:24:16,307 --> 00:24:18,672
Keep thinking like that
and you're gonna blow it.

415
00:24:18,777 --> 00:24:22,200
You listen to me,
I'll get you to the State Championship.

416
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:25,192
Look, man,
I gave you respect 'cause you got game--

417
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,960
had game.

418
00:24:27,475 --> 00:24:32,211
But now you're just an old gimpy-ass
has-been trying to tell me what to do.

419
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:53,202
Jason, you can't keep
doing this, man.

420
00:24:53,306 --> 00:24:55,091
- Doing what?
- Showing up late.

421
00:24:55,196 --> 00:24:57,472
Studio time costs money,
and it's by the hour.

422
00:24:57,577 --> 00:24:58,791
So? It's not my money.

423
00:24:58,895 --> 00:25:02,730
Okay. You're not gonna become a rock
star by having a few decent melodies.

424
00:25:02,837 --> 00:25:05,100
You actually have to have
hard work and dedication.

425
00:25:05,207 --> 00:25:06,720
Whatever.

426
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,803
All right. You know what?

427
00:25:11,908 --> 00:25:13,350
You can go.

428
00:25:13,457 --> 00:25:16,362
- I can go?
- Yes. I'm dismissing you from the band.

429
00:25:16,468 --> 00:25:18,020
You are not needed any longer.

430
00:25:18,126 --> 00:25:19,793
You're dismissing me
from my own band?

431
00:25:19,896 --> 00:25:22,371
Yes, only it's not
your band anymore.

432
00:25:22,475 --> 00:25:24,202
I just kicked you out.

433
00:25:24,308 --> 00:25:26,090
We'll see about that.

434
00:25:26,577 --> 00:25:30,410
You cannot kick him out of the band!
He is the band!

435
00:25:30,517 --> 00:25:32,772
Haley, Brooke put up a lot
of money for this, okay?

436
00:25:32,876 --> 00:25:34,391
I quit my job.

437
00:25:34,497 --> 00:25:37,143
I asked you to produce the band,
not break them up,

438
00:25:37,247 --> 00:25:40,782
and without Jason,
I have no band!

439
00:25:43,988 --> 00:25:44,942
Just hear me out,

440
00:25:45,046 --> 00:25:47,790
because you said that there was
something magical about their sound

441
00:25:47,828 --> 00:25:50,023
and you couldn't figure
out what it was, right?

442
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:52,690
- It's Mia.
- Who?

443
00:25:52,795 --> 00:25:54,722
Mia-- she's the
keyboard player.

444
00:25:54,828 --> 00:25:56,643
She's the magic, Peyton,
and I'm telling you,

445
00:25:56,745 --> 00:26:00,583
her spark is getting squashed
by this ass of a singer.

446
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:04,770
I knew we shouldn't have
signed with your crap label!

447
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:10,453
Peyton, I know how
important this is to you.

448
00:26:10,557 --> 00:26:14,270
I promise you I am not wrong.

449
00:26:18,698 --> 00:26:20,110
Jason...

450
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:21,850
you're fired.

451
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:23,412
What the--

452
00:26:27,466 --> 00:26:30,652
Stupid, stupid label.
Can't win.

453
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:34,763
You know what?
You can come with me or stay and suck.

454
00:26:37,955 --> 00:26:40,501
Thanks, dog.
That's what I thought.

455
00:26:40,608 --> 00:26:42,222
Mia, let's go.

456
00:26:42,328 --> 00:26:44,823
Mia, if you stay,
you're gonna make a great record.

457
00:26:44,926 --> 00:26:46,172
I'll help you.

458
00:26:46,276 --> 00:26:48,152
Mia, now.

459
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:54,080
- I think I'm gonna stay.
- You're an idiot.

460
00:26:54,185 --> 00:26:56,321
Don't call me an idiot!

461
00:26:57,056 --> 00:27:00,410
And stop playing the ballads.
Those are mine.

462
00:27:00,515 --> 00:27:03,582
You know what?
You just made a big mistake.

463
00:27:03,686 --> 00:27:05,223
All of you.

464
00:27:09,268 --> 00:27:10,961
Later, bitches.

465
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:17,223
Everything's gonna be okay.
I promise.

466
00:27:28,727 --> 00:27:30,201
You look amazing.

467
00:27:31,205 --> 00:27:35,801
Okay. I'm sorry. Is this weird?
Because it feels really weird.

468
00:27:36,377 --> 00:27:37,781
Okay. Look.

469
00:27:38,396 --> 00:27:42,621
We had a relationship. Okay?
We can't pretend that we didn't.

470
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:46,532
But...

471
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,511
before that,
we were really close friends.

472
00:27:50,688 --> 00:27:53,080
There's no reason we
can't have that again.

473
00:27:53,836 --> 00:27:55,271
Right?

474
00:27:56,218 --> 00:27:57,823
Right.

475
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:21,460
Brooke, how awesome is this?

476
00:28:21,565 --> 00:28:23,853
I know. I think
that the whole town showed up.

477
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:28,520
I can't blame them. There hasn't been
a party here since... well, ever.

478
00:28:28,627 --> 00:28:32,022
- Can't believe I got in looking like this.
- Oh, stop. Where's Lindsey?

479
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,511
She's in New York.
I came with Peyton.

480
00:28:35,746 --> 00:28:37,561
That is some dress.

481
00:28:37,898 --> 00:28:40,173
I don't know.
You don't think it's too sexy?

482
00:28:40,275 --> 00:28:43,020
It's not something a respectable
wife or mother would wear.

483
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:44,860
You should definitely get it.

484
00:28:45,888 --> 00:28:48,543
- The dress is on me.
- No. I can't let you do that.

485
00:28:48,648 --> 00:28:50,830
I can do anything I want.
It's my party.

486
00:28:50,936 --> 00:28:54,992
Think of it as a present for taking
such good care of my godson.

487
00:28:55,515 --> 00:28:57,232
Sorry I don't have
anything for you, Nate.

488
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,013
That's a present for me, too.

489
00:29:00,716 --> 00:29:03,672
And these press kits
look just... pathetic.

490
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:06,520
Coming from you,
I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

491
00:29:07,275 --> 00:29:10,380
Hey, don't let it get to you.
I have a bitchy boss, too.

492
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:13,471
On my first day at work,
she told me she hated my face.

493
00:29:13,575 --> 00:29:15,743
Victoria threw a
snakeskin purse at me.

494
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:17,703
Mine threw me against the wall.

495
00:29:17,807 --> 00:29:20,592
- You must hate her.
- Yeah, kind of.

496
00:29:22,555 --> 00:29:25,021
I have to go.

497
00:29:29,238 --> 00:29:32,413
Oh, I know you.

498
00:29:32,516 --> 00:29:35,531
You're one of my daughter's
ill-chosen love interests.

499
00:29:36,547 --> 00:29:38,820
You must be very
proud of Brooke.

500
00:29:38,925 --> 00:29:40,703
I can't believe all
she's accomplished.

501
00:29:40,807 --> 00:29:44,130
Yes, and her taste
has greatly improved.

502
00:29:44,236 --> 00:29:45,673
Thank God.

503
00:29:45,807 --> 00:29:47,401
If you'll excuse me.

504
00:29:48,977 --> 00:29:52,611
- Oh, don't take it personally.
- She just--

505
00:29:52,715 --> 00:29:54,761
Verbally punched you
in the goodies? Yeah.

506
00:29:54,868 --> 00:29:56,413
That's how she says hi.

507
00:29:56,517 --> 00:29:59,581
And I thought Brooke was being dramatic
when she talked about her mom.

508
00:29:59,688 --> 00:30:01,381
Nope. All true.

509
00:30:01,488 --> 00:30:04,032
Hey, P. Sawyer, I need you.

510
00:30:07,867 --> 00:30:09,122
What's up?

511
00:30:09,228 --> 00:30:11,181
I have a little
something for you.

512
00:30:11,286 --> 00:30:13,770
It's a present to say thanks
for helping me with everything.

513
00:30:13,877 --> 00:30:17,300
Brooke, I love it,
but you do not have to do this.

514
00:30:17,405 --> 00:30:19,810
You've already done
so much for me.

515
00:30:21,897 --> 00:30:23,913
So, how are things with Lucas?

516
00:30:24,727 --> 00:30:26,093
What do you mean?

517
00:30:26,198 --> 00:30:30,091
Peyton, you asked me to be honest
with you about why I'm staying,

518
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:32,742
and I need you to do
the same with me, okay?

519
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:34,043
Okay.

520
00:30:34,276 --> 00:30:39,252
Lucas seems really happy right now.
And we like Lindsey, and...

521
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:42,143
It's just not high
school anymore.

522
00:30:42,245 --> 00:30:44,773
It's not about Lucas, okay?

523
00:30:44,878 --> 00:30:47,483
Okay. Good.

524
00:30:47,657 --> 00:30:51,353
'Cause the cute bartender's
been eyeing you all night.

525
00:31:03,115 --> 00:31:05,852
Hey. Man, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

526
00:31:05,957 --> 00:31:09,983
- Your sexy boss lady is here.
- I know. I saw her...and her date.

527
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:11,972
Man, don't feel bad about that.

528
00:31:12,075 --> 00:31:13,851
Cougars go after
all kind of prey.

529
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:15,170
You can't change that.

530
00:31:15,276 --> 00:31:17,813
That's like telling a
rainbow not to be colorful.

531
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:21,431
Yeah, well, I didn't sign up to
be some meaningless plaything.

532
00:31:21,807 --> 00:31:23,552
I'm done with this.

533
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:25,933
See ya.

534
00:31:26,687 --> 00:31:28,253
Mind if I call her?

535
00:31:36,336 --> 00:31:37,901
Ready to go?

536
00:31:39,346 --> 00:31:42,911
Actually, I think
I'm gonna stay. So...

537
00:31:43,788 --> 00:31:45,540
good night.

538
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:50,400
He's not good enough for you.

539
00:32:04,016 --> 00:32:07,201
- Don't do that!
- Do what?

540
00:32:07,306 --> 00:32:09,633
"He's not good
enough for you"?!

541
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:14,170
I don't want you saying things
like that to me, Lucas!

542
00:32:14,275 --> 00:32:16,220
That's not fair to me!

543
00:32:16,327 --> 00:32:18,680
That's not fair to
Lindsey, either!

544
00:32:43,848 --> 00:32:45,281
How does it feel?

545
00:32:45,386 --> 00:32:48,841
Oh, you know, before we opened,
I could only think

546
00:32:48,948 --> 00:32:52,000
about the displays and the catering,
and then the crowd came in,

547
00:32:52,106 --> 00:32:54,570
and I got to share what
I do with the people I love,

548
00:32:54,676 --> 00:32:57,692
and it was...amazing.

549
00:32:58,265 --> 00:33:00,873
Well, here is to
a job well done.

550
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:02,290
Thank you.

551
00:33:05,257 --> 00:33:07,753
So, how did the store do?

552
00:33:08,226 --> 00:33:09,871
Let's find out.

553
00:33:16,668 --> 00:33:18,102
Well?

554
00:33:20,946 --> 00:33:24,293
We sold a couple scarves,
some handbags.

555
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:27,203
No gowns? A suit?

556
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,043
Not even a dress?

557
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:31,813
Well...

558
00:33:31,918 --> 00:33:35,223
No. I don't think you sold one
high-dollar piece all night.

559
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:38,211
In fact, if you factor
in the party expenses

560
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:39,880
and all the pieces
you gave away,

561
00:33:39,988 --> 00:33:42,433
I believe your store has run
the biggest opening-day deficit

562
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:44,352
in our company's history.

563
00:33:45,238 --> 00:33:47,402
At least it wasn't
a complete disaster.

564
00:33:47,508 --> 00:33:49,643
Where is she? You!
Whatever your name is,

565
00:33:49,746 --> 00:33:53,603
pack up the inventory and ship it to
our Houston store. They're expecting it.

566
00:33:55,218 --> 00:33:56,792
They're expecting it?

567
00:33:57,265 --> 00:33:59,293
You knew this was gonna happen?

568
00:33:59,395 --> 00:34:02,210
Darling, you've never
had a head for business.

569
00:34:02,318 --> 00:34:05,352
That's why I've tried
to protect you from it.

570
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:08,921
High-end lines don't do well
in sleepy little towns.

571
00:34:09,027 --> 00:34:11,961
Beautiful things
die in Tree Hill.

572
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:14,133
Why do you think we left?

573
00:34:16,627 --> 00:34:18,083
I don't believe this.

574
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:20,202
I know how much
this meant to you.

575
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:25,162
And if you had sold just
one couture piece...

576
00:34:25,735 --> 00:34:28,941
I'd consider letting
you keep the store.

577
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:31,550
But you didn't.

578
00:34:32,885 --> 00:34:34,241
Brooke?

579
00:34:35,257 --> 00:34:37,832
I'd like to buy this dress.

580
00:34:38,998 --> 00:34:40,373
No. It's too much.

581
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:43,741
I think it's worth every cent,
and I want to pay for it.

582
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:45,583
Oh, my goodness.

583
00:34:46,987 --> 00:34:49,041
I believe in you, Brooke.

584
00:34:49,145 --> 00:34:52,673
So you see,
I'm not just buying a dress.

585
00:34:53,516 --> 00:34:56,043
What I'm buying is
a whole lot more.

586
00:34:58,285 --> 00:35:01,030
This changes nothing.

587
00:35:07,966 --> 00:35:10,743
Our first real check.

588
00:35:10,886 --> 00:35:13,051
I'm gonna have to frame this.

589
00:35:13,157 --> 00:35:15,550
But if you frame it,
you can't cash--

590
00:35:17,645 --> 00:35:20,533
Oh, good,
'cause it definitely would have bounced.

591
00:35:22,606 --> 00:35:24,041
Thank you.

592
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:50,982
Sorry.

593
00:35:54,095 --> 00:35:55,592
Sounds great.

594
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:58,010
You couldn't stay
away either, huh?

595
00:35:58,418 --> 00:36:00,643
Honestly, I think
I'm gonna throw up.

596
00:36:00,746 --> 00:36:02,280
What if I'm not worth it?

597
00:36:02,388 --> 00:36:03,801
You are.

598
00:36:04,237 --> 00:36:05,952
I really believe that,

599
00:36:06,058 --> 00:36:09,141
but you've got to believe it,
too, you know?

600
00:36:09,487 --> 00:36:10,813
Yeah.

601
00:36:11,856 --> 00:36:13,640
Oh, don't worry.

602
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:17,270
We'll face all of
this... tomorrow.

603
00:36:18,445 --> 00:36:21,111
So, where's this
song go after that?

604
00:36:21,218 --> 00:36:23,511
It goes back up to the "D."

605
00:36:23,618 --> 00:36:26,833
What if you go to the "E"?

606
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:29,192
It might give it a
little diversity.

607
00:36:29,297 --> 00:36:30,852
Yeah.

608
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:33,112
Yeah. Let me try that.

609
00:36:57,045 --> 00:37:01,383
When you get a chance,
I'd love to see that dress on you.

610
00:37:03,728 --> 00:37:06,550
- Night, mama.
- Oh, going to bed already?

611
00:37:06,655 --> 00:37:09,592
I haven't seen you all day.
Oh, I miss you.

612
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:15,553
Okay. Go upstairs.
I'll be up in a minute, all right, bud?

613
00:37:15,656 --> 00:37:17,241
I just want to
talk with Carrie.

614
00:37:17,347 --> 00:37:18,622
Oh, okay. Sure.

615
00:37:18,727 --> 00:37:20,362
All right, buddy.
You ready to go to bed?

616
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:22,002
All right.

617
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:25,460
Is everything okay?

618
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:28,122
Actually, everything's great.

619
00:37:28,225 --> 00:37:30,792
I'm getting back into music,
and Nathan's healing,

620
00:37:30,898 --> 00:37:34,380
Jamie's never been happier.

621
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:36,771
And most importantly,
I'm actually starting to feel

622
00:37:36,877 --> 00:37:38,672
like we're a family again.

623
00:37:38,777 --> 00:37:40,170
I'm glad to hear that.

624
00:37:40,278 --> 00:37:42,111
You had a lot to do with it.

625
00:37:42,215 --> 00:37:46,353
So if I haven't said it a
hundred times already, I just--

626
00:37:46,666 --> 00:37:48,243
thank you.

627
00:38:10,647 --> 00:38:12,670
What are you doing here?

628
00:38:13,286 --> 00:38:17,801
I saw you at the Clothes
Over Bro's opening.

629
00:38:19,345 --> 00:38:21,090
Who's the guy?

630
00:38:21,368 --> 00:38:24,273
My gosh. Are you jealous?

631
00:38:28,877 --> 00:38:31,490
My private life is
my own business,

632
00:38:31,598 --> 00:38:36,471
but just so you know,
he was completely boring.

633
00:38:36,577 --> 00:38:38,982
I'm here at work, aren't I?

634
00:38:43,038 --> 00:38:44,473
What are you working on?

635
00:38:44,578 --> 00:38:47,970
I'm trying to find some new
weekend segment reporters.

636
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:50,680
I think I have some
really good candidates.

637
00:38:55,727 --> 00:38:58,111
So let me ask you something.

638
00:38:59,446 --> 00:39:01,871
Your place or mine?

639
00:39:20,195 --> 00:39:22,091
Brooke, what's wrong?

640
00:39:23,477 --> 00:39:26,793
The store is a total failure.

641
00:39:26,895 --> 00:39:28,781
What are you talking about?

642
00:39:28,885 --> 00:39:31,020
I didn't sell one
real piece tonight.

643
00:39:31,128 --> 00:39:34,081
I sold a dress, but it was a pity
purchase and it doesn't count.

644
00:39:34,186 --> 00:39:38,331
And the worst part is that
Victoria saw this all coming.

645
00:39:40,466 --> 00:39:44,191
My mother's right-- when I'm left up
to my own devices, I'm a failure.

646
00:39:44,296 --> 00:39:46,411
No. Hey, listen to me.

647
00:39:47,348 --> 00:39:50,163
You were never a failure, okay?

648
00:39:50,678 --> 00:39:53,151
I mean, you won
three cheerleading competitions,

649
00:39:53,255 --> 00:39:55,102
and what did Victoria
have to say about that?

650
00:39:55,207 --> 00:39:57,513
Oh, wait.
Nothing, 'cause she wasn't there.

651
00:39:57,618 --> 00:40:01,802
She also wasn't there when you won the
miss June Bug title at the county fair

652
00:40:01,908 --> 00:40:04,781
or when you were elected
student-body president.

653
00:40:05,885 --> 00:40:08,872
Brooke, if you're a failure,
what does that make me?

654
00:40:10,925 --> 00:40:12,982
Pretty lame, I guess.

655
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:15,910
Okay.

656
00:40:16,676 --> 00:40:18,290
I don't want to talk
about my night anymore.

657
00:40:18,395 --> 00:40:20,692
Tell me about
the dishy bartender.

658
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:23,833
I wasn't really feeling it.

659
00:40:41,976 --> 00:40:45,211
Lindsey. Hi.

660
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,603
I miss you.
