1
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:07,001
I have cancer.

2
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:09,103
- Oh, no, no, no.
- It's pancreatic.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,372
Julian?

4
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:16,361
We don't know what tomorrow will bring.

5
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:18,022
I want to go out with you...

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,301
On a date.

7
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:23,030
- Excuse me.
- Are you Katie Ryan?

8
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:44,217
What's his problem?

9
00:00:44,284 --> 00:00:46,737
Costume malfunction.

10
00:00:46,804 --> 00:00:48,615
I'm not coming out!

11
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:50,120
This isn't funny, Josh!

12
00:00:50,188 --> 00:00:51,259
No, it's not!

13
00:00:51,327 --> 00:00:53,236
What's his deal?

14
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:55,145
Maybe he wants to know why his director

15
00:00:55,213 --> 00:00:56,250
is an hour late to set.

16
00:00:56,318 --> 00:00:57,993
No sleep. Don't ask.

17
00:00:58,061 --> 00:00:59,265
Josh?!

18
00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:01,140
Get out here before I tell everybody

19
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,920
who you went home with last Saturday.

20
00:01:08,637 --> 00:01:10,306
This is bull...

21
00:01:10,374 --> 00:01:11,647
Someone find...

22
00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:13,052
Brooke!

23
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,859
What the hell is this?

24
00:01:14,926 --> 00:01:17,669
It's the jogging scene.
Is there a problem?

25
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:19,506
The problem, Brooke,
is that my romantic lead

26
00:01:19,574 --> 00:01:23,520
looks like the love child of
Richard Simmons and a village person.

27
00:01:23,587 --> 00:01:25,059
Well...

28
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:28,168
I guess I made a huge, stupid,

29
00:01:28,236 --> 00:01:30,041
unforgivable mistake.

30
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:31,544
Imagine that.

31
00:01:31,612 --> 00:01:33,584
Brooke, this is not the
costume we agreed on.

32
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:36,626
Well, then, I guess I'm
also a dirty, no-good liar.

33
00:01:36,695 --> 00:01:37,764
Good morning, Paul.

34
00:01:43,848 --> 00:01:45,617
No special effects, baby.

35
00:01:45,686 --> 00:01:47,054
If you like what you see,

36
00:01:47,122 --> 00:01:48,892
that's exactly what I'm working with.

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,498
Um, barf.

38
00:01:56,714 --> 00:01:58,751
Hey, Tay, it's your mother.

39
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,388
Again.

40
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:03,529
Call me, honey.

41
00:02:03,596 --> 00:02:05,768
It smells suspiciously like

42
00:02:05,836 --> 00:02:08,107
birthday chicken-dumpling soup in here.

43
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:12,284
Well, I was feeling particularly
energetic this morning,

44
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:15,691
and it's the least I can do
for having missed your birthday.

45
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,195
Well, you didn't miss my birthday, mom.

46
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:18,498
I just didn't get your message

47
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:19,801
because I was at that fundraiser.

48
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:21,939
Same difference. We didn't
speak on your birthday.

49
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,308
First time ever.

50
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,311
Well, I would continue to argue with you,

51
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,513
but I really want soup.

52
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,818
So can I please stir the dumpling batter?

53
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:30,889
Ah, you know you can, sweetie.

54
00:02:30,957 --> 00:02:33,795
It's always been a
two-person recipe, baby.

55
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,502
Hey, mom.

56
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,539
I love you.

57
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:42,511
Oh... good... lord.

58
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,382
You have been saying that every 10 minutes

59
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:45,785
since you learned I have cancer.

60
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:48,589
I'm not gonna keel over
in the soup pot, Haley.

61
00:02:48,657 --> 00:02:50,226
Okay. But in case I do...

62
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:54,000
I love you, too.

63
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,377
Now, let's not be morbid.

64
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:03,550
Stir.

65
00:03:08,393 --> 00:03:10,763
Dressed to kill at 9:00 in the morning.

66
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:12,867
Either you met a boy or...

67
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:14,403
You met a boy.

68
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,508
I met an agent. A very cute agent.

69
00:03:17,576 --> 00:03:19,411
With a very expensive car

70
00:03:19,513 --> 00:03:23,285
and a very naked ring finger.

71
00:03:23,352 --> 00:03:26,356
And did this miracle of
nature and bachelorhood

72
00:03:26,424 --> 00:03:27,558
sign you to his agency?

73
00:03:27,626 --> 00:03:29,395
I'm meeting with him this morning.

74
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:32,066
He'll either sign me or marry me.

75
00:03:32,134 --> 00:03:34,136
Either way, this just
might be the first day

76
00:03:34,204 --> 00:03:38,143
of the rest of my life.

77
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:39,412
So...

78
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,981
shall we get to the elephant in the room?

79
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:42,650
Sure.

80
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:45,222
His name is Harold, and he's very sweet.

81
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,125
He never forgets, but he's very forgiving.

82
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:48,829
And on that note...

83
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,932
I'm really sorry I asked you out.

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,434
It's okay.

85
00:03:52,502 --> 00:03:54,838
No, it's not. I had too much to drink.

86
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:57,443
And Haley was at tric giving
this kind of "carpe diem" speech

87
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,546
that just makes you want
to stand on your desk

88
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,851
and tear the pages out of your textbook.

89
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:04,255
And I just...

90
00:04:04,322 --> 00:04:05,858
I got carried away.

91
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:08,328
Well, I was flattered.

92
00:04:08,396 --> 00:04:09,797
Seriously.

93
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:11,200
It's just...

94
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:12,569
Skills.

95
00:04:12,636 --> 00:04:14,204
Actually, it's more Millicent.

96
00:04:14,272 --> 00:04:16,740
You were just jealous of
her hanging out with Owen.

97
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:19,408
Look...

98
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:22,643
I really like you.

99
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:24,577
But I would rather be
your partner in crime

100
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:26,244
than your rebound.

101
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,247
Wheel man or bag man?

102
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:33,881
Bag lady. No. Bag... woman?

103
00:04:33,948 --> 00:04:37,483
I'll just take the food.

104
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:41,319
Hey.

105
00:04:41,387 --> 00:04:43,387
What are you looking at?

106
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:48,087
It's your mom's funeral arrangements.

107
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,455
She left them here on the desk.

108
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,695
It's like contracts.

109
00:04:57,763 --> 00:05:00,364
This is how it ends, huh?

110
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:01,765
With a line-item total.

111
00:05:01,832 --> 00:05:03,867
Hales, it's okay.

112
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:07,204
I can... I can read through this stuff.

113
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:12,474
How am I supposed to do this, Nathan?

114
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:14,676
The same way you always do...

115
00:05:14,744 --> 00:05:18,313
Gracefully and courageously...

116
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,349
And with me at your side
every step of the way.

117
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:23,483
Okay?

118
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:25,018
Okay.

119
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,028
So, Mr. Agent...

120
00:05:37,096 --> 00:05:38,929
tell me this is just the beginning

121
00:05:38,997 --> 00:05:41,565
of a beautiful relationship.

122
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:47,537
"Let's not be morbid"?

123
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:50,039
You left your funeral
arrangements lying around, mom.

124
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:51,207
Mom?

125
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:54,943
Mom! Mom!

126
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,078
Mom! Mom! No, no, mom. Hey! Hey!

127
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:59,380
Nathan! Nathan!

128
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:00,747
Nathan!

129
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:10,769
It's just amazing how difference between good a
day and a bad day can come down to a good, long...

130
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:11,869
Ouch!

131
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:14,437
Oops. You were saying?

132
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:16,906
I was saying a good, long sleep

133
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:18,507
can totally give you
an attitude adjustment.

134
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:19,674
You should try it.

135
00:06:19,742 --> 00:06:21,509
Like it was the sleep.

136
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:26,847
Oh, you're grumpy because
we had sex, aren't you?

137
00:06:26,915 --> 00:06:29,349
Excuse me?

138
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:30,717
I told him not to tell you.

139
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:32,318
Besides, it just sort of happened,

140
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:34,086
and then it just sort
of happened again and...

141
00:06:34,154 --> 00:06:35,187
Ouch! Son of a...

142
00:06:35,255 --> 00:06:37,288
It just sort of happened.

143
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,990
Whatever.

144
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:40,492
Ouch!

145
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:42,060
And then it just sort of happened again.

146
00:06:46,331 --> 00:06:48,432
I know my stats could be better,

147
00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:49,633
but I'm training like crazy.

148
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,100
And let's be honest...

149
00:06:51,168 --> 00:06:52,835
They're better than Anna
Kournikova's were at my age.

150
00:06:52,903 --> 00:06:55,438
And at the risk of
sounding a little conceited,

151
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:59,174
I, like Anna, could make
a wheaties box look good.

152
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,544
You're right... on all accounts.

153
00:07:03,612 --> 00:07:06,280
I have no doubt that you have a
very bright future ahead of you,

154
00:07:06,348 --> 00:07:10,217
you know, both professionally
and commercially.

155
00:07:10,284 --> 00:07:12,118
B... but I... I can't represent you.

156
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:16,354
I don't get it. Then why am I here?

157
00:07:16,422 --> 00:07:19,057
Because I thought I could. But I can't.

158
00:07:19,124 --> 00:07:21,692
And I can't really explain it.

159
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,760
I'm sorry.

160
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:27,530
Well, if you can't sign me...

161
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,866
The least you can do is take
me out on a consolation date.

162
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:32,601
A date?

163
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:34,402
Come on.

164
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,171
I saw the way you were
looking at me last night.

165
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:39,940
You were practically imagining our babies.

166
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:42,409
Look, I'm... I'm sorry...

167
00:07:42,476 --> 00:07:44,543
Hey. It's okay.

168
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:47,312
I think you're hot, too.

169
00:07:51,783 --> 00:07:53,617
Hi.

170
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:57,620
When?

171
00:07:57,688 --> 00:07:59,055
I'm so sorry.

172
00:07:59,123 --> 00:08:00,122
I'm on my way.

173
00:08:01,658 --> 00:08:02,958
Yeah.

174
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:05,126
Yeah.

175
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:08,162
Call me when the fire's put out.

176
00:08:09,897 --> 00:08:13,165
I'm sorry, but that's
not gonna happen, Sara.

177
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:13,999
"Sara"?

178
00:08:17,173 --> 00:08:18,275
Right.

179
00:08:18,343 --> 00:08:19,676
I mean Katie.

180
00:08:19,744 --> 00:08:20,810
Who's Sara?

181
00:08:20,878 --> 00:08:22,211
I got to go.

182
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,758
"Hi, daughter." "Hi, mother."

183
00:08:37,826 --> 00:08:39,592
How was your morning
on the set, daughter?"

184
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,827
Oh, it was just fine, mother.

185
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:44,295
Fine until the ex love of my life

186
00:08:44,363 --> 00:08:46,597
and current bane of my existence

187
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:47,831
made it very clear to me

188
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:51,301
that they did the wild thing last night!"

189
00:08:53,774 --> 00:08:55,776
This is where the motherly sympathy

190
00:08:55,844 --> 00:08:57,578
is supposed to start kicking in!

191
00:08:57,646 --> 00:08:58,813
Sorry.

192
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,650
I've been, um, wasting
all my self-pity on me.

193
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:05,653
But if misery loves company,

194
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:07,821
I did get stood up last night.

195
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:10,089
Paul stood you up?

196
00:09:10,156 --> 00:09:11,587
What a toad!

197
00:09:11,655 --> 00:09:12,820
I never said it...

198
00:09:12,888 --> 00:09:14,488
You didn't have to.

199
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,689
It is so clear to me that the Julian apple

200
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,891
did not fall far from
the sleazy Paul tree!

201
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:33,836
Did I ruin the soup?

202
00:09:33,904 --> 00:09:36,339
Well, that depends on
whether or not you think

203
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:38,474
my floor is clean enough to eat off.

204
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:41,408
And I was looking forward to that.

205
00:09:41,476 --> 00:09:43,441
And in my condition,

206
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:47,441
one can only do so much looking forward.

207
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:48,943
It's okay.

208
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,912
You're gonna be around long
enough to make a lot more soup.

209
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,681
Hey, girls. It's okay.

210
00:09:54,749 --> 00:09:55,982
The doctors talked to me, too.

211
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:58,783
And I know that I...

212
00:09:58,851 --> 00:10:01,987
I don't have much time.

213
00:10:02,055 --> 00:10:04,957
But it's okay.

214
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:09,896
I had wonderful visits
with each of my children.

215
00:10:11,768 --> 00:10:14,202
It's not fair.

216
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,805
Doctors promised you a few more months.

217
00:10:16,872 --> 00:10:20,741
Cancer doesn't care
much for promises, baby.

218
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:23,777
I mean, after all, I promised myself

219
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:25,011
that I would stick around

220
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:27,246
until you two were
right with Taylor again.

221
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:30,916
Well, great. You'll be here forever.

222
00:10:33,086 --> 00:10:34,686
God.

223
00:10:34,754 --> 00:10:38,623
You all were probably too
young to remember, but...

224
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:43,994
you three girls were...

225
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:46,029
You were inseparable at one point.

226
00:10:46,096 --> 00:10:47,397
I mean, look.

227
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:52,801
That's a long time ago.

228
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:57,506
Yeah. She seems almost human here.

229
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:00,775
Two out of three.

230
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,580
Ain't bad.

231
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:10,584
Come here.

232
00:11:10,652 --> 00:11:11,819
My sweet things.

233
00:11:26,832 --> 00:11:28,933
You should really call first.

234
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,867
Mom's dying.

235
00:11:30,935 --> 00:11:32,369
Yeah, eventually.

236
00:11:32,437 --> 00:11:34,371
No. Now.

237
00:11:34,438 --> 00:11:39,042
She collapsed this morning,
and they don't think that...

238
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,177
This it it, Taylor.

239
00:11:41,245 --> 00:11:43,179
This is the time to say goodbye.

240
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:45,980
I don't think so.

241
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:48,682
Please stop.

242
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,585
Look, I don't know what your problem is.

243
00:11:51,653 --> 00:11:54,788
And I... I don't understand you at all.

244
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:56,756
I don't know when or why

245
00:11:56,824 --> 00:12:00,093
you became such a colossal, selfish bitch.

246
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,162
But I know that you're my sister.

247
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,564
And I love you.

248
00:12:05,632 --> 00:12:07,399
And I know that mom wants to see you.

249
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:10,468
And I know that it's
the right thing to do.

250
00:12:12,304 --> 00:12:16,140
Well, you also know that I
rarely do the right thing.

251
00:12:16,207 --> 00:12:18,175
Taylor, please.

252
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:22,778
Fine. I tried.

253
00:12:22,846 --> 00:12:26,048
Way to go, perfect daughter!

254
00:12:30,018 --> 00:12:32,186
What the hell is this?

255
00:12:32,254 --> 00:12:34,021
That's the real you.

256
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:36,290
The sister you used to be.

257
00:12:36,357 --> 00:12:37,390
I...

258
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:40,293
I don't want this, Quinn!

259
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:44,864
I don't want this.

260
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,148
Well, that must have been
some dream you were having.

261
00:13:06,216 --> 00:13:08,216
You were awfully smiley.

262
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:12,052
I was dreaming about your dad.

263
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,889
I woke up smelling his cologne.

264
00:13:15,956 --> 00:13:17,423
What kind did he wear?

265
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:20,793
Stetson.

266
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,494
Back when I first met him,

267
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:26,198
he was something of a dime-store cowboy.

268
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:28,467
A cowboy? Dad?

269
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:30,735
We can't be talking about the same father.

270
00:13:30,803 --> 00:13:34,838
You'd be surprised what you
don't know about that man.

271
00:13:34,906 --> 00:13:37,407
Or about both of us, actually.

272
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:40,510
Like what?

273
00:13:40,578 --> 00:13:42,078
Oh, I don't know.

274
00:13:42,146 --> 00:13:45,014
Well, come on, like...

275
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:47,951
Did you guys have a song or...

276
00:13:48,018 --> 00:13:51,721
"Don't think twice, it's
all right" by Bob Dylan.

277
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,490
That's a breakup song.

278
00:13:54,558 --> 00:13:58,594
I know, but it's what was
playing in that old Chevy pickup

279
00:13:58,962 --> 00:14:01,497
- the first time that we...
- Uh, uh, "kissed," please.

280
00:14:01,564 --> 00:14:02,598
"Kissed."

281
00:14:02,665 --> 00:14:04,399
Oh, now, that...

282
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:07,501
that was at a Christmas mixer.

283
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:08,935
Mistletoe...

284
00:14:09,003 --> 00:14:11,437
Nat King Cole on the record player.

285
00:14:11,505 --> 00:14:13,607
Huh.

286
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:17,745
I felt that kiss in my toes.

287
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:20,548
And you won his heart with
your chicken-dumpling soup, huh?

288
00:14:20,616 --> 00:14:22,350
I won his heart...

289
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:28,088
With a note that I left
in his jean-jacket pocket.

290
00:14:28,155 --> 00:14:31,624
I won his stomach with
my chicken-dumpling soup.

291
00:14:35,928 --> 00:14:39,662
I don't even have the recipe.

292
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,431
Well, give me a pen.

293
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,234
Come on.

294
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,837
Here.

295
00:14:50,904 --> 00:14:52,639
Now...

296
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:57,175
The secret, as you know...

297
00:14:57,243 --> 00:15:00,208
Is to stir the batter slowly.

298
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:03,640
And whole peppercorns.

299
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,676
None of that table stuff.

300
00:15:06,743 --> 00:15:10,512
And always start with
a whole chicken, okay?

301
00:15:15,484 --> 00:15:16,917
Hey, jame!

302
00:15:18,153 --> 00:15:20,287
We need to talk, buddy.

303
00:15:20,355 --> 00:15:22,689
Man to man?

304
00:15:22,757 --> 00:15:25,525
Yeah.

305
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:27,460
When you were at andre's this morning,

306
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:29,395
your grandma got sicker.

307
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:30,863
She's in the hospital now.

308
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,765
And, um, she'd like to see you.

309
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,135
She's gonna die now, isn't she?

310
00:15:42,373 --> 00:15:43,773
Man to man?

311
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:48,077
Yeah, buddy.

312
00:15:48,144 --> 00:15:49,878
Pretty soon.

313
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:54,849
You want to talk about it?

314
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:58,252
If it wasn't for grandma,
I wouldn't have Chester.

315
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,755
Didn't your mom and I buy you Chester?

316
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:03,923
Yeah, but you didn't really have a choice.

317
00:16:03,991 --> 00:16:05,791
Grandma taught me to wish on a star.

318
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:08,860
And you wished for Chester?

319
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:10,195
Wouldn't you?

320
00:16:10,263 --> 00:16:12,096
Yeah.

321
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:17,201
Can I have a few minutes before we leave?

322
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,269
Sure.

323
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:21,804
I'll be downstairs with
your mom, all right?

324
00:16:27,343 --> 00:16:31,045
All right, let's go,
people! Rehearsal's up!

325
00:16:31,113 --> 00:16:32,814
It was crazy-hot.

326
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:35,015
When he finally caught
his breath enough to speak,

327
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,617
he actually called it
a religious experience.

328
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,853
I know.

329
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,925
But the last girl he was with

330
00:16:47,992 --> 00:16:50,127
practically qualifies
for a senior discount.

331
00:16:50,195 --> 00:16:51,995
I know.

332
00:16:53,364 --> 00:16:54,864
Julian?

333
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,334
Have you called last looks
for hair and makeup yet?

334
00:16:58,401 --> 00:16:59,601
No. Why?

335
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:01,369
Just trying to be professional.

336
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,493
Alex, you okay?

337
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:09,926
I'm fine.

338
00:17:09,994 --> 00:17:12,361
Ouch.

339
00:17:12,428 --> 00:17:14,429
Wow. Ouch.

340
00:17:15,598 --> 00:17:17,598
Get off my set.

341
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,067
Do you have any idea the kinds of
things she has been saying about...

342
00:17:20,135 --> 00:17:22,336
I don't care, Brooke! Get off my set!

343
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:24,271
- Julian!
- I don't care!

344
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:28,708
Yeah, I guess you've
made that pretty obvious.

345
00:17:28,776 --> 00:17:30,043
Excuse me.

346
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,350
It smells awesome.

347
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,688
It's my mom's recipe.

348
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:46,322
You okay?

349
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,491
Yeah, I was just...

350
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,126
Where's Jamie?

351
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:52,327
He'll be downstairs in a second.

352
00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:53,528
Haley.

353
00:17:55,564 --> 00:17:57,765
He knows.

354
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,900
I thought we decided we
weren't gonna tell him.

355
00:17:59,968 --> 00:18:01,835
He guessed.

356
00:18:04,905 --> 00:18:07,306
Of course he did. He's
so familiar with death.

357
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:08,841
- Why wouldn't he?
- Haley.

358
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:10,175
Ow! Damn it!

359
00:18:10,243 --> 00:18:11,877
- Are you
okay? - Mm-hmm.

360
00:18:11,944 --> 00:18:13,978
Are you okay? Is it bad?

361
00:18:14,046 --> 00:18:15,379
Yeah, it's bad. It's really bad.

362
00:18:15,447 --> 00:18:16,880
My mom's dying, and I'm making soup!

363
00:18:16,948 --> 00:18:18,615
Because there's nothing else that I can do

364
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:21,283
because I can't stop it
because nothing can stop it!

365
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:25,153
Okay. All right.

366
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:28,189
There's just... this is so...

367
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:30,591
There's so many moments
and there's so much

368
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:34,361
that go with her when she dies.

369
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:36,163
I don't know what the
right questions are to ask.

370
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:38,332
And I don't... I'm not ready for this.

371
00:18:38,399 --> 00:18:40,734
I'm just really not ready.

372
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,507
Nobody ever is.

373
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:49,244
Whoa. You all right?

374
00:18:49,312 --> 00:18:52,647
In movies, you never see how
much punching hurts the puncher.

375
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,115
And who did the puncher punch?

376
00:18:54,182 --> 00:18:56,282
- Alex.
- Because?

377
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,085
Because I went to Julian's
hotel room last night,

378
00:18:59,153 --> 00:19:01,020
and I saw Alex naked in his bed,

379
00:19:01,088 --> 00:19:03,022
and I could hear him in the shower.

380
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,957
Oh, dear.

381
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:06,791
- Yeah. You said it.
- No, I meant...

382
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:08,725
"Oh, dear, I don't know
whose room she was in,

383
00:19:08,793 --> 00:19:14,058
but Alex was with me last night.

384
00:19:14,126 --> 00:19:16,260
And she was very naked."

385
00:19:16,328 --> 00:19:17,728
You?

386
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:18,762
Yes.

387
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,162
Not Julian?

388
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,697
No.

389
00:19:21,764 --> 00:19:23,397
In Julian's hotel room?

390
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:24,598
Apparently.

391
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,532
Oh, my God!

392
00:19:28,135 --> 00:19:29,402
Hey, come on!

393
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:32,304
Look, whatever you've done...

394
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,440
How... how bad can it be?

395
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,509
We're completely screwed.

396
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:39,211
We can't shoot a thing
until the swelling goes down.

397
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,079
Okay.

398
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,647
"Okay"?

399
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:45,049
This is a
$50,000-a-day operation.

400
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,584
Let's do the math
before we call it "okay."

401
00:19:47,652 --> 00:19:49,719
I am so sorry.

402
00:19:49,787 --> 00:19:51,087
This is not your fault. We'll just...

403
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:52,755
Roll with the punches?

404
00:19:54,658 --> 00:19:58,761
Right now your job is to
keep ice on that eye, okay?

405
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:07,668
Uh, looks like we're gonna
get a couple days off.

406
00:20:07,736 --> 00:20:09,870
You know what's good on a black eye?

407
00:20:09,938 --> 00:20:12,172
If you say, "raw meat,"

408
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,975
I will tear out your tonsils,
tie off your weiner bag,

409
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:17,443
and castrate you like a bull.

410
00:20:17,511 --> 00:20:21,380
Well, you mess with the bull...

411
00:20:21,448 --> 00:20:24,383
You know what you get.

412
00:20:26,052 --> 00:20:28,886
That doesn't even make sense!

413
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:49,405
Well, well.

414
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:55,977
I could smell it coming
all the way down the hall.

415
00:20:57,612 --> 00:20:59,780
Ah, here's the real test.

416
00:21:04,618 --> 00:21:06,119
How's it taste? Is it too salty?

417
00:21:06,187 --> 00:21:08,021
Are the dumplings soggy?

418
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,794
It's perfect.

419
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,329
It's not perfect.

420
00:21:14,397 --> 00:21:16,865
I made it myself, and
it's a two-person recipe.

421
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:19,067
Oh, sweetie.

422
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:24,100
I followed your recipe to the letter.

423
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:25,367
And when it was finished,

424
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:27,100
I realized that it's not the soup I love.

425
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:29,765
It's making it with my mom.

426
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:30,998
Okay.

427
00:21:31,065 --> 00:21:33,466
And now she's leaving me.

428
00:21:33,534 --> 00:21:37,036
I may have some unconventional
beliefs about the afterlife,

429
00:21:37,103 --> 00:21:38,704
but I can tell you right now

430
00:21:38,772 --> 00:21:41,740
I have no intention of leaving you.

431
00:21:41,807 --> 00:21:45,142
You just prepare to be
haunted, Haley James Scott.

432
00:21:48,046 --> 00:21:49,379
Hi, grandma!

433
00:21:50,715 --> 00:21:52,849
Oh, goodness gracious!

434
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,384
When did they start letting
squirrels into the hospital?

435
00:21:55,452 --> 00:21:57,386
Get on up here, boy.

436
00:21:57,454 --> 00:21:59,021
Give your old grandmother a kiss.

437
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:04,091
What you got there, huh?

438
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,460
"The handsomest husky."

439
00:22:06,528 --> 00:22:09,096
Mom reads to me whenever I'm sick.

440
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:10,697
It pretty much makes me feel better.

441
00:22:10,765 --> 00:22:11,965
You want to hear it?

442
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:15,702
I can't think of anything

443
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,437
that I would like more.

444
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:20,105
"Once upon a time, there
was a dog named Andy.

445
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:23,141
Everybody loved Andy.
He was very handsome.

446
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:25,877
Andy had a best friend. His name was Mike.

447
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:29,846
Andy and Mike did everything together."

448
00:22:51,242 --> 00:22:52,943
Why is the store closed?

449
00:22:53,011 --> 00:22:55,879
And why are you lying on the floor?

450
00:22:55,946 --> 00:22:58,547
I'm trying to pick a place to hang myself.

451
00:22:58,615 --> 00:23:00,549
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

452
00:23:00,616 --> 00:23:04,418
Apparently it's best to
find a load-bearing beam.

453
00:23:04,485 --> 00:23:06,119
I don't think we have one.

454
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,957
Fine.

455
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,059
You want to talk about it?

456
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:17,394
What is there to discuss?

457
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:22,063
I'm the donkey in a big,
stupid shakespearean mixup.

458
00:23:22,131 --> 00:23:24,665
You're not making any sense.

459
00:23:24,733 --> 00:23:29,035
Alex slept with Alexander, not Julian.

460
00:23:30,638 --> 00:23:33,808
So, I ruined wardrobe...

461
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:36,945
bitched out the one man
who makes my world turn...

462
00:23:37,013 --> 00:23:38,813
And clocked an interloping hoochie

463
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,015
whose only mistake was
boning crocodile dundee.

464
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:46,117
You realize you're overlooking
the best part of this...

465
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:48,218
Julian didn't sleep with Alex.

466
00:23:50,788 --> 00:23:53,055
And as far as that Shakespearean play,

467
00:23:53,123 --> 00:23:56,824
as I recall, the donkey gets
turned back into a person

468
00:23:56,892 --> 00:23:58,792
once he realizes what an ass he's been.

469
00:24:00,228 --> 00:24:02,362
You think I should go talk to Julian?

470
00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:05,297
It's far less tacky than suicide.

471
00:24:08,066 --> 00:24:09,400
Thanks, mom.

472
00:24:13,937 --> 00:24:15,471
Hi, mom.

473
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:17,238
Hey.

474
00:24:17,306 --> 00:24:18,507
Hey.

475
00:24:18,575 --> 00:24:19,909
How you feeling?

476
00:24:19,977 --> 00:24:22,212
Ooh, a little tired.

477
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:24,081
What's with all the hardware?

478
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:25,416
Your daughter and I

479
00:24:25,483 --> 00:24:27,685
have been working on
something special for you.

480
00:24:27,753 --> 00:24:29,553
I'll be right back.

481
00:24:29,621 --> 00:24:32,690
Okay.

482
00:24:36,962 --> 00:24:41,828
Now, you know that I loved David, but...

483
00:24:41,895 --> 00:24:44,729
I have the same feeling about Clay

484
00:24:44,797 --> 00:24:46,697
that I did with Nathan.

485
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:49,133
I think he's one of the good ones.

486
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,335
Yeah.

487
00:24:51,403 --> 00:24:54,338
He's special.

488
00:24:54,406 --> 00:24:56,206
I really love him.

489
00:24:56,274 --> 00:24:57,907
Well, have you told him?

490
00:24:57,975 --> 00:25:00,342
Not yet.

491
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,512
But I think he's pretty clear on that.

492
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:05,814
Oh, you do, do you?

493
00:25:05,882 --> 00:25:09,417
Well, just in case you
haven't figured this out yet,

494
00:25:09,485 --> 00:25:13,587
men need to be hit over
the head with things.

495
00:25:13,655 --> 00:25:15,590
Sometimes frying pans.

496
00:25:15,657 --> 00:25:18,159
But mostly love.

497
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:20,360
Don't be afraid to do it.

498
00:25:20,428 --> 00:25:22,162
Am I that obvious?

499
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,830
You have always been my heart girl,

500
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:28,466
the one with the most unbridled passions.

501
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:32,235
Just give your head permission

502
00:25:32,302 --> 00:25:34,570
to follow your heart, okay?

503
00:25:34,637 --> 00:25:37,739
Okay. I promise.

504
00:25:48,148 --> 00:25:50,182
Hi.

505
00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:05,834
Oh, my God!

506
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:07,370
Didn't know your own
strength, did you, bamm-bamm?

507
00:26:07,438 --> 00:26:10,039
Uh... I was...

508
00:26:10,107 --> 00:26:13,008
You're looking for Julian. Come in.

509
00:26:13,075 --> 00:26:15,010
He switched rooms with me
last night because the guys

510
00:26:15,078 --> 00:26:17,479
in the room next to me were
keeping me up with their...

511
00:26:17,547 --> 00:26:19,614
Whatever they were doing.

512
00:26:19,682 --> 00:26:22,950
Which explains why he was exhausted today.

513
00:26:24,986 --> 00:26:26,253
Can I ask why you punched me?

514
00:26:26,321 --> 00:26:27,554
Because I know we weren't gonna,

515
00:26:27,622 --> 00:26:29,289
like, braid each other's
hair anytime soon,

516
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:31,424
but I kind of thought we were okay.

517
00:26:31,492 --> 00:26:33,759
We were.

518
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:36,295
We are. I...

519
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:39,298
I came here last night, late.

520
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:40,867
You were sleeping,

521
00:26:40,935 --> 00:26:44,403
and I guess it was
Alexander in the shower?

522
00:26:44,471 --> 00:26:46,171
But you thought it was Julian.

523
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:49,874
I wish.

524
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,410
Seriously, I'm not
gonna lie to you, Brooke,

525
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:54,945
but it's never gonna happen between us.

526
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,480
You know why?

527
00:26:56,547 --> 00:26:58,014
Because whether you guys

528
00:26:58,082 --> 00:27:00,783
continue to push each other away or not,

529
00:27:00,851 --> 00:27:04,119
he knows what it's like
to really be in love.

530
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:06,288
I never had a chance.

531
00:27:10,292 --> 00:27:12,460
Alex, I'm sorry.

532
00:27:12,527 --> 00:27:14,495
For everything.

533
00:27:15,897 --> 00:27:17,764
Me too.

534
00:27:17,832 --> 00:27:20,032
For everything.

535
00:27:42,318 --> 00:27:46,288
I'm so glad you came.

536
00:27:46,355 --> 00:27:49,523
You know it's all right to
be upset about all of this.

537
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:51,292
I mean...

538
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:53,727
Lord knows I am.

539
00:27:53,795 --> 00:27:58,297
It's pretty upsetting stuff.

540
00:28:05,237 --> 00:28:07,004
I came to tell you

541
00:28:07,072 --> 00:28:10,307
that I'm sorry for being
such a disappointment.

542
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:13,410
Is that what you think?

543
00:28:13,477 --> 00:28:16,179
That I'm disappointed with you?

544
00:28:16,246 --> 00:28:18,781
Why wouldn't you be?

545
00:28:18,849 --> 00:28:21,349
I'm awful.

546
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:25,585
All of my siblings are talented or smart

547
00:28:25,653 --> 00:28:27,620
or both.

548
00:28:27,688 --> 00:28:29,822
And I'm just Taylor.

549
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:33,657
Nobody likes Taylor.

550
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:35,392
I do.

551
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,395
You have to say that. You're my mother.

552
00:28:38,463 --> 00:28:40,933
Get over here.

553
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:43,903
Come here.

554
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:48,039
Here is something...

555
00:28:48,107 --> 00:28:51,409
That nobody else knows.

556
00:28:51,477 --> 00:28:53,711
Of all of my kids,

557
00:28:53,778 --> 00:28:57,947
you are the one who reminds
me the most of myself.

558
00:28:58,015 --> 00:28:59,816
I don't believe it.

559
00:28:59,883 --> 00:29:03,752
Well, that's because you've
only known Lydia the mom.

560
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,488
But there was a very...

561
00:29:06,555 --> 00:29:09,190
Taylor-ish Lydia before that.

562
00:29:09,258 --> 00:29:13,460
And that's why I have never had any doubt

563
00:29:13,528 --> 00:29:17,163
that you will find
your way, because I did.

564
00:29:17,231 --> 00:29:19,332
And you can fight this all you want,

565
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,568
but you are going to end up happy.

566
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:26,471
I've been so awful.

567
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:28,072
How can you still love me?

568
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:32,243
Oh, God! My sweet baby.

569
00:29:32,311 --> 00:29:36,079
My love for you has
never been in question.

570
00:29:36,147 --> 00:29:37,914
The only question here is,

571
00:29:37,982 --> 00:29:43,085
how long is it going to take
for you to love yourself?

572
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,788
Because wherever I am,

573
00:29:46,856 --> 00:29:49,457
wherever I go from here...

574
00:29:49,525 --> 00:29:52,660
I will never, ever

575
00:29:52,728 --> 00:29:54,662
let go of you.

576
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:56,230
Please don't leave.

577
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,237
It's okay.

578
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,138
It's okay.

579
00:30:24,821 --> 00:30:27,055
- Victoria, I just want to say...
- Don't bother.

580
00:30:27,123 --> 00:30:28,389
I know why you stood me up.

581
00:30:28,457 --> 00:30:30,091
You were with that snotty little actress.

582
00:30:30,158 --> 00:30:32,026
It was just sex. It...

583
00:30:32,985 --> 00:30:34,770
Victoria, you and I are different, okay?

584
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,298
Finished! Good night, Alexander.

585
00:30:59,717 --> 00:31:01,817
I have a surprise for you.

586
00:31:03,253 --> 00:31:05,354
I love surprises.

587
00:31:05,421 --> 00:31:06,755
What is it?

588
00:31:15,964 --> 00:31:17,664
Make a wish.

589
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,206
What's going on?

590
00:31:32,077 --> 00:31:34,478
An audience.

591
00:31:48,456 --> 00:31:50,990
Listen.

592
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:53,759
I'm really sorry.

593
00:31:53,827 --> 00:31:57,362
I know that I have been a lousy sister.

594
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,998
And I totally don't deserve it...

595
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:05,269
but if you could maybe
give me another chance.

596
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:08,171
Okay?

597
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:11,374
From now on, I'll be better.

598
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:21,548
It's okay.

599
00:32:40,383 --> 00:32:42,317
I know I'm banned from the set,

600
00:32:42,385 --> 00:32:44,619
but I need to clear something up.

601
00:32:44,687 --> 00:32:46,554
Well, this better be good.

602
00:32:46,621 --> 00:32:49,488
That black eye's gonna
cost us about 100 grand.

603
00:32:49,556 --> 00:32:51,956
If it helps, it cost me my dignity.

604
00:32:52,024 --> 00:32:54,358
Brooke, what the hell happened today?

605
00:32:54,426 --> 00:32:57,260
I thought you slept with Alex.

606
00:32:57,328 --> 00:33:00,664
So, basically, you still don't trust me.

607
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:03,166
No. Basically I got jealous.

608
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:05,034
Because I'm in love with you, Julian,

609
00:33:05,101 --> 00:33:07,202
and I always will be.

610
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:10,071
And that's gonna make me
do stupid things sometimes

611
00:33:10,139 --> 00:33:11,606
because love is crazy.

612
00:33:11,673 --> 00:33:15,609
And I've been crazy. I know.

613
00:33:15,677 --> 00:33:17,711
First, I thought you
were falling for Alex,

614
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:20,247
and then, last night,
I went to your hotel,

615
00:33:20,315 --> 00:33:22,048
and I thought you fell for Alex.

616
00:33:22,116 --> 00:33:23,951
I'm sorry.

617
00:33:31,858 --> 00:33:34,159
You think too much, Brooke Davis.

618
00:33:47,706 --> 00:33:49,874
Are you comfortable?

619
00:33:49,942 --> 00:33:51,275
Yes.

620
00:33:51,343 --> 00:33:53,411
Okay, mom. Here we go.

621
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:03,086
Oh, my goodness.

622
00:34:06,723 --> 00:34:10,155
My beautiful babies.

623
00:34:53,622 --> 00:34:54,556
How long have you been out here?

624
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,227
I like you.

625
00:35:00,294 --> 00:35:02,895
- Okay?
- I know I slept with Alex.

626
00:35:02,963 --> 00:35:05,297
But I like you.

627
00:35:05,365 --> 00:35:06,431
A lot.

628
00:35:09,835 --> 00:35:11,602
I like...

629
00:35:29,784 --> 00:35:31,351
Nice job othe eye.

630
00:35:31,419 --> 00:35:32,553
Not good enough for film,

631
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,987
but definitely good enough for sex.

632
00:35:35,422 --> 00:35:40,225
If you talk, I can't
pretend you're somebody else.

633
00:36:17,356 --> 00:36:20,591
I guess I did all right, didn't I?

634
00:36:25,063 --> 00:36:28,098
You did everything, mom.

635
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:32,501
Hello, handsome.

636
00:38:46,715 --> 00:38:49,083
Come in.

637
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:51,285
- Hey.
- Hey.

638
00:38:54,222 --> 00:38:58,390
Okay, look, I wasn't worried
about being your rebound, Mouth.

639
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:01,026
I was worried you'd be mine.

640
00:39:01,093 --> 00:39:02,894
What are you saying?

641
00:39:02,962 --> 00:39:05,597
I'm saying...

642
00:39:05,664 --> 00:39:07,298
What the hell.

643
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,274
Anybody home?

644
00:39:19,342 --> 00:39:22,010
Hey, baby.

645
00:39:53,037 --> 00:39:54,404
Something smells awesome.

646
00:39:54,472 --> 00:39:55,672
Mm.

647
00:39:55,739 --> 00:39:58,708
This is your grandma's
chicken-dumpling soup.

648
00:39:58,775 --> 00:40:00,409
And you are just in time.

649
00:40:00,477 --> 00:40:02,244
- I am?
- Yes.

650
00:40:02,311 --> 00:40:03,745
Did you know that this is

651
00:40:03,813 --> 00:40:06,047
a very special
chicken-dumpling soup recipe

652
00:40:06,115 --> 00:40:07,415
that specifically calls

653
00:40:07,482 --> 00:40:09,883
for a handsome
7-year-old boy named Jamie

654
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:12,052
to stir the dumpling batter?

655
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,353
What are the chances?

656
00:40:13,421 --> 00:40:14,754
I don't know.

657
00:40:24,963 --> 00:40:29,066
Now, the secret is to
stir the batter slowly.

658
00:40:29,134 --> 00:40:33,036
And the whole peppercorns,
not the table stuff.

659
00:40:34,405 --> 00:40:36,606
Hey. What's up?

660
00:40:40,343 --> 00:40:42,678
What's up is that I love you.

661
00:40:42,745 --> 00:40:45,246
In case you didn't know.

662
00:40:51,819 --> 00:40:53,887
I love you, too.

663
00:40:53,955 --> 00:40:55,822
Nothing's ever gonna change that.

664
00:41:00,827 --> 00:41:04,462
Did I tell you? I'm gonna get that agent.

665
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,330
He decided to sign you?

666
00:41:06,398 --> 00:41:08,032
Not yet, but he will.

667
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,401
'Cause it turns out...

668
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:18,708
I'm his type.
