1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,130
previously on "one tree hill".

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,020
it's over.

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,440
Because of one bad signing?

4
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,290
Go home,write another book.

5
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,480
I promise I'll read the next one.

6
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,070
Listen,I heard you were looking 
for the opportunity to play ball again.

7
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,660
- Yes,sir. 
- Well,I have one for you.

8
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,340
So,what do you think,man?

9
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,240
You gonna come play for us?

10
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,710
You have to do this,daddy.

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,220
I'm just worried my back can't take something like this right now.

12
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,500
Ohh.

13
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,330
I'm surprising myself by saying it,

14
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,070
but.I have an extra room,

15
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,940
and it's yours if you want it.

16
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,640
We're prepared to offer you a bigger salary

17
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,500
and the on-air position you should have had.

18
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,370
You get a better position and a hot intern.

19
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,400
Hot intern?

20
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,810
- Gigi? 
- Mouth!

21
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,670
What?You guys know each other?

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,750
We were high-school lovers.

23
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,200
You'll be careful,right?

24
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,930
I won't go trying to be a hero or anything.

25
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,130
Come here.

26
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,620
I'll be back,peyton.

27
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,450
I believe you.

28
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,110
I told you I wanted to be a mom,

29
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,390
and you ran away so fast,

30
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,900
you left an owen-shaped hole in my front door.

31
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,990
You're right.

32
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,770
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,930
You're still a jerk.

00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,390
All right,nice work,guys.

38
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,930
Go home,get some rest.

39
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,240
Game time's 8:00.

40
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,110
Not bad for a rookie.

41
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,200
You ready for tonight?

42
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,140
Bring it on.I got this.

43
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,170
We'll see,man.

44
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,920
It's kind of different in the game.

45
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,830
How different?

46
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,660
that different.

47
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,510
Did he get up,mama?

48
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,070
Yeah,baby,he got up.this time.

49
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,770
Hey.How's he doing?

50
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,040
Well,he's in one piece for now,

51
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,760
but I thought owen was gonna protect him.

52
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,810
Hey,99,thought you were gonna protect 23!

53
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,450
And why don't you get over your whole fear of 
having children while you're at it?

54
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,540
Hey,you're short.

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,930
I'm 5.What's your excuse?

56
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,910
Nice.So,what's your name?

57
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,730
James lucas scott.

58
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,930
Scott,huh?

59
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,280
Yeah,he's teacher's pet.

60
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,340
Hi,sam.

61
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,590
How uncool are you,hanging out with your teacher?

62
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,030
It's borderline creepy.

63
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,490
Totally.

64
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,030
So,what's going on here?

65
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,540
It's called slamball.

66
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,090
Dunks are worth three points,
and jump shots are worth two points.

67
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,120
My daddy plays on the slashers with owen.

68
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,850
You hear me,owen?

69
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,180
You better watch nathan's back!

70
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,400
Literally!

71
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,570
They used to kiss.

72
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,360
Hey,sam,I'm peyton.

73
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,510
I really like your outfit,man.

74
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,560
Thank you.It's a lot like yours,actually.

75
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,880
Geez,millie,who knew you were such a sports fan?

76
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,550
I'm not.I'm looking for mouth.

77
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,740
Mouth and gigi?

78
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,090
Gigi the ex?

79
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,560
Gigi the college junior/the new intern/

80
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,380
the ex with her college-girl body and her college-girl face!

81
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,110
Okay.

82
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,710
They used to kiss -- mouth and gigi.

83
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,130
He kisses millicent now.

84
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,730
- I'm liking you. 
- Thanks.

85
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,720
Mama says I'm not allowed to date yet,but daddy says it's fine.

86
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,970
- What? 
- Hey,P.

87
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,210
Sawyer- soon-to-be-scott,

88
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,150
where's your fancy fianc?

89
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,570
I have no idea.

90
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,990
Could you say that again?

91
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,920
No,I-I guess I just don't understand.

92
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,290
I thought the book wasn't doing well.

93
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,970
Oh.

94
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,800
Wow.

95
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,860
Man,this is some great stuff.

96
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,150
Yes.It is.

97
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,260
Um,marvin?

98
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,170
Millicent,hi.

99
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,300
What are you doing down here?

100
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,530
Just wanted to say hi.

101
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,290
Okay.Hi.

102
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,290
Oh,uh,millie,this is gigi,my intern.

103
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,430
Gigi,this is millicent.

104
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,680
Hi.Millicent.

105
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,550
Marvin's girlfriend.

106
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Millicent -- marvin's hot girlfriend.

107
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,120
Nice work,mouth.

108
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,920
- Hi.Gigi. 
- Hi.

109
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,570
So,should I wait for you after the game or.

110
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,470
um,well,we have to go back to the studio 
and digitize some of this footage.

111
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,010
We're doing a piece on nathan's journey to slamball.

112
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,600
It was mouth's idea.

113
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,030
He's kind of a genius like that.

114
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,500
You have awesome legs,by the way.

115
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,900
Yeah.Okay.

116
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,260
I'll see you at home,then?

117
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,550
Not too late?

118
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,710
Not too late.

119
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,500
Well,we better get back to the game.

120
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,060
Watch your step,mouth.

121
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,380
Why?

122
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,130
You don't want to trip on that short leash.

123
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,660
Time-out.

124
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,020
Nathan,you made three jump shots in a row.

125
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,180
What the hell is that?

126
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,290
It's called scoring.

127
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,870
It's called slamball!

128
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,470
What are you -- hurt?You need a seat?

129
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,650
No,I'm good.

130
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,040
Then get in there and take over this game.

131
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,990
Now,I need you.Let's go.

132
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,970
- Hey. 
- Hey,there he is.

133
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,210
I thought you might have ditched me.

134
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,160
What's up?

135
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,530
I just got a call from my agent.

136
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,810
Someone made an offer for the movie rights to my book.

137
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,110
Luke!For "the comet"?That's great!

138
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:22,140
No,actually,not for "the comet," but,um,"ravens.

139
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,140
1,2,3.

140
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,300
Slashers!

141
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,680
What you think,man?You up for this?

142
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,500
Not if it's gonna put me back in a wheelchair.

143
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,230
It won'T.That's easy for you to say.

144
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,480
You're not the one with the ball.

145
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,350
Exactly.

146
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,110
Stay behind me.

147
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,500
All right.

148
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,480
Hot ball,hot ball!

149
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,650
Knock his ass out!

150
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,940
- Nice! 
- Thanks.

151
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,870
Let's go,all-american.

152
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,690
wasn't he,like,just in a wheelchair or something?

153
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,570
morning,daddy.

154
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,060
You're alive,right?

155
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,450
I think so.

156
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,900
Can you walk?

157
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,860
Yeah,I'm good.

158
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,350
Prove it.

159
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,120
I will if you get off me,you dork.

160
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,940
Should I get mama?

161
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,690
Jamie,I'm fine.Look.

162
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,450
You happy?

163
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,000
No?

164
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,770
Well,the dancing's not so good,but okay.

165
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,010
Good game,daddy.

166
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,260
Haley james?

167
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,710
In here!

168
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,710
There's coffee.

169
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,950
We pretty much share this house 50/50,don't you think?

170
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,560
- Yeah.Why? 
- I don't know.

171
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,620
This stupid article.

172
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,320
Do I even want to ask?

173
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm fine.

174
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,620
Really,I'm fine.

175
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,010
What?

176
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,620
So,you've had a night to sleep on it.

177
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,690
Where's your head at with this whole movie thing?

178
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,850
I don't know.

179
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,730
You know,on one hand,it could be really cool.

180
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,740
But you know how personal that book is.

181
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,660
You know,the stuff with us and keith.

182
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,560
Yeah,but it's already in the book,right?

183
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,620
Yeah,I know.

184
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:21,450
I guess I just feel like I can control the book more.

185
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,950
Well,whatever you decide to do is 
the right thing as far as I'm concerned.

186
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,460
Thanks,babe.

187
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,100
I got to get going.

188
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,060
All right,well,call me when you get there,
and be careful,all right?

189
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,840
I will.

190
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,030
Hey.

191
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,910
I sort of like you,you know that?

192
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,690
Well,thank you.

193
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,020
I'm kind of warming up to you,too.

194
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,400
It's a good thing,since we're getting married.

195
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,910
Bye.

196
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,920
It's really good,brooke.

197
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,730
Peyton's gonna love it when it's done.

198
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,540
Yeah,well,I hope so,considering we have nothing else to sell.

199
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,510
How could I have signed my company over to that.

200
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,150
- slut? 
- Too nice.

201
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,390
How about.slunt?

202
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,410
Millie,what are we gonna do with this place?

203
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,060
You know what?I like it like this.

204
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,920
Oh,do you?

205
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,530
Aunt brooke!

206
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,320
It's my favorite man.

207
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,130
Who's your favorite girl?

208
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,720
Sam!

209
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,060
Excuse me?

210
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,990
Who is yr favorite girl?

211
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,730
You are?

212
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,740
All right,that'll do.Get out of here.

213
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,530
I have been replaced.

214
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,080
I will take one unfinished wedding dress.

215
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,440
That's all I want,and I'll pay top dollar for it.

216
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:50,070
Well,I'll pay top dollar for one song off of an unfinished album.

217
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,080
I don't like this game anymore.

218
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,540
Mm,I feel you.

219
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,040
So,what's going on with baby brooke?

220
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,890
Victoria's lawyers say she owns it.

221
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,970
Brooke's lawyers say victoria's lawyers 
can baby brooke themselves.

222
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,700
Have you thought about starting a new line,brooke?

223
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,890
You've done it before.You can do it again.

224
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,770
I appreciate the vote of confidence,haley,

225
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,030
but I'm just not feeling inspired lately.

226
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,270
Well,speaking of,owen looked pretty hot last night.

227
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,330
Didn't you think so,millie?

228
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,100
Totally.What did you think,brooke?

229
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,080
I think sam is driving me crazy,

230
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:28,680
wilding about like a feral cat!

231
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,600
Sam,this is a boutique.

232
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,160
It is not a skate park.

233
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,020
Well,you could have fooled me.

234
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,740
If you have a plan to fill this place up,have at it.

235
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,540
Otherwise,go skate in traffic.

236
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,920
Clearly,I've upgraded sam's foster-living environment.

237
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,730
Clearly.

238
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,840
Mama,can I sleep over at aunt brooke's tonight?

239
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,240
Oh,sweetie,I don't know if aunt brooke

240
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,570
I would love that.

241
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,050
It would be nice to have a man in the house.

242
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,960
Awesome.Thank you.

243
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,730
And speaking of,I thought owen looked pretty hot last night.

244
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,900
Didn't you think so,millie?

245
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,600
Totally.What did you think,brooke?

246
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,400
I think I don't like either of you.

247
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,410
Lucas scott.

248
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,950
- Maybe. 
- Julian baker.

249
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,820
I think your agent called you about me.

250
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,690
I'm interested in optioning your book.

251
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,960
Yeah,they called me last night.

252
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,290
Uh,they didn't say anything about you coming to town,though.

253
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,690
No,no.Actually,they don't know.

254
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,040
I'm just passing through on my way to new york.

255
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,220
Right.

256
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,590
You're just passing through tree hill,huh?

257
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,290
Absolutely.Yeah,I want to get a feel

258
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,920
for the people and places that inspired your book.

259
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,030
It is really great work,lucas.

260
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,710
- Yeah,well,thanks,but 
- yeah,you probably feel a little ambushed.

261
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,060
- Yeah,a little bit. 
- Yeah,right.

262
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,270
I'm sorry.I understand.

263
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:54,410
When I get ,when I get inspired by something,
I get a little obsessed.

264
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,170
Not in a peyton-stalker sort of way,just -- just driven.

265
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,720
What did you say your name was again?

266
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,920
- Julian baker. 
- Julian.

267
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,900
I tell you what.I'm gonna be in town for the night.

268
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,160
Check out my credits online.

269
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,670
If you're feeling it,give me a call.We'll grab a drink.

270
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,930
You got plans?

271
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,290
Maybe.

272
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,780
That's exactly what I would have said.

273
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,770
Fair enough.

274
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,050
But if you don't,at least hear me out.

275
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,080
If you don't like what I have to say,
I'm gone,okay?I promise.

276
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,840
At the very least,you get a couple of 
free drinks from a guy who loves your work.

277
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,180
All right,your agent has my number,okay?

278
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,700
- Okay. 
- Good.

279
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,790
Well,it's great to finally meet you,lucas scott.

280
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,190
Your reputation precedes you.

281
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:48,440
Oh,by the way,the house is exactly like I pictured it.

282
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,660
It's perfect.

283
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,330
So,congratulations.

284
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,540
Congratulations,marine.

285
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,710
What did you do?Save another life?

286
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,100
No.They just thought it would look good with the uniform.

287
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,020
- Hi,peyton. 
- Hi,big brother.

288
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,620
Hey,I missed you.

289
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,340
I missed you,too.

290
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,270
Come on.

291
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,670
- Hey,gigi. 
- Hey,sexy.

292
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,570
And you wonder why millicent has me on such a short leash.

293
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,490
Look,I know we're friends,but since you're my intern,

294
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,730
maybe you should call me something other than sexy,all right?

295
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,300
Okay,hot piece of ass.

296
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,170
Sorry.

297
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,740
How are you doing with the nathan footage?

298
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,020
Uh,it's all in the system.

299
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,760
I've got video from nathan in high school,

300
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,030
video from gilmore,video from maryland.

301
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,180
I think I've even got that video of him 
and brooke in there somewhere.

302
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,680
All right.

303
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,310
How about we start with something from his accident?

304
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,090
You know,we set the stakes.

305
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,640
Then we can flash back and work our way up to slamball.

306
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,000
Talented and sexy.

307
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,050
- Gigi. 
- Oh,come on,mouth.

308
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,780
If I can't joke around with you,who can I joke around with?

309
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,620
Besides,you know you love it.

310
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,160
That is not the point.

311
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,300
Oh,so you do love it.

312
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,220
Just start with the accident,and I'll be back.

313
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,100
Gigi,uh.

314
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,000
it is nice working with you again.

315
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,270
You're doing great.

316
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,350
Thanks.

317
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,640
I know I give you a lot of grief,

318
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:00,030
but I think it's amazing watching you work.

319
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,030
I missed you.

320
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,330
Sexy.

321
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,430
- Hey,man. 
- Hey.

322
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,480
- What you doing? 
- Making pancakes.

323
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,280
Really?Why?

324
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,110
'Cause I want pancakes.

325
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,400
There's a list over there on the table.

326
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,090
What's the list for?

327
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,220
Guys to play me in the movie.

328
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,730
God,you've got to be kidding me.

329
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,820
What?I don't want some tool playing me.

330
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,190
So,I guess you've heard,huh?

331
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,970
Yeah.Haley told me.

332
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,330
It's pretty cool,man.

333
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,920
Yeah,I guess.

334
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,520
The producer actually stopped by my door today.

335
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,300
Good guy?

336
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,380
You know,it's hard to say.

337
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,100
You know,I mean,he's got some cool credits,but.

338
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,920
I don't know.I don't want them to screw this up,you know?

339
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,160
I mean,who's gonna be directing it?

340
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,030
Who's gonna write the script?

341
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,670
Maybe that's a question you should ask him.

342
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,850
Yeah.

343
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,080
You want some pancakes now,don't you?

344
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,950
Yes,I do.

345
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,800
Hey,and,uh,hate to break it to you,
but shia labeouf?

346
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,210
I think he's a little too old to play you for high school.

347
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,020
Oh,come on,man.

348
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,620
You've seen how old these actors are playing high school.

349
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,780
- Yes. - Thank you.

350
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,280
So,did you see me get my clocked cleaned in the game last night?

351
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,540
No,actually,I missed it.

352
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,600
How are you feeling?

353
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,300
I'm a little sore.

354
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,070
Haley was kind of freaked out,but I'm fine.

355
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,220
You know,luke,I never saw this slamball thing coming,

356
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,010
but I guess that's part of the journey.

357
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,950
And this movie thing -- I mean,

358
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,490
it could be good for you,could really open some other doors.

359
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,210
Yeah,maybe.

360
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,900
Hey,nate.

361
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:46,130
Haley's holding her breath over slamball 
so you can chase your dream.

362
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,400
Just,uh.

363
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,110
let her know it's gonna be okay,all right?

364
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,740
Yeah.

365
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,160
What's peyton think of the movie?

366
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,010
Uh,what do you mean?

367
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,410
Well,I mean,she's basically half the book.

368
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,800
How does she feel about it?

369
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,230
She said she's good with it either way.

370
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,440
What about brooke?

371
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,290
Dude,brooke's the other half.

372
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,720
I was happy to get your letter and the invitation.

373
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,000
A little surprised,though.

374
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,970
I just figured you'd be out by now.

375
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,630
You make it sound like prison.

376
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,120
No,no,I mean,you've been in a while.

377
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,410
The marines have been good for me,all right?

378
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,050
It's what I know.

379
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:35,480
So,how was he?Our dad,mick?

380
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,430
Mm,I mean,pretty much the way you said he'd be  kind of lost.

381
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,230
I think underneath everything,he is a good guy,

382
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,800
but he's just not much of a father.

383
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,990
You know,I asked mick to play a U.S.O.Show for us once.

384
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,630
Entertain the base.I figured,it's what he does,you know?

385
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,050
Yeah.

386
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,950
He said he'd get back to me.

387
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,780
I'm still waiting.

388
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,860
I miss quentin a lot,mama.

389
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,260
I miss him,too,buddy.

390
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,870
I think he's playing basketball,like daddy.

391
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,040
Only instead of a trampoline,he can bounce on the clouds.

392
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,570
Yeah?I like that.

393
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,040
Did you always like quentin,mama?

394
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:25,110
You know,the first time I met quentin,
I thought he was a bad kid.

395
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,310
But I was wrong.

396
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,480
He had such a good heart.

397
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,860
He was just.afraid to show it at first.

398
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,090
You excited about your sleepover with aunt brooke?

399
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,810
- Oh,yeah. 
- Oh,good.

400
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,800
We should get going,buddy.

401
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,690
Okay.Bye,"Q.

402
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,000
" Chester says bye,too.

403
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,350
He misses you like we do.

404
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,810
Bye,quentin.

405
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,260
Do you think he's lonely in heaven?

406
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,050
No.I think he's happy.

407
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,310
I think he is,too.

408
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,830
Hey.

409
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,040
So, where's the little orphan girl?

410
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,380
What's her name?Annie?

411
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,990
Sam. And you so cannot be in here right now!

412
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,440
Why not?

413
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,230
Because I am working on peyton's wedding dress, 

414
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,110
and it is bad luck to see it before the wedding.

415
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,320
And considering your luck with weddings, my friend, 

416
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,520
would you really like to chance this?

417
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,700
Very funny.

418
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:35,270
But I thought that,the dress **lied 
only when the bride was wearing it.

419
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,860
You might have a point there.

420
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,970
Fine.

421
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,990
It's your wedding to ruin anyway.

422
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,300
Tell me that you're here because you want me 
to make your tux and double my business.

423
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,460
Actually, I'm meeting with this movie producer about "ravens," 

424
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,910
and I wanted to talk to you about it first.

425
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,830
I'm thinking natalie portman should play me.

426
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,240
I can call her if you want.

427
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,590
It's set in high school.

428
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,390
Does anybody get that?I mean.

429
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,260
great.

430
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:02,020
So, I suppose you'll be getting some snot from the cw?

431
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,670
At least they're hot.

432
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,470
Okay, so, does that mean it's okay with you, I mean,

433
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,420
if the book becomes a movie?

434
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,930
Sure. Why not?

435
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,900
Well, I don't know.Sometimes things 
get lost in translation, you know?

436
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,380
Okay.I think you're jumping to conclusions here, writer boy.

437
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,370
Because first of all, it's got to get made.

438
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:27,960
And if it does, who's to say 
it's not gonna be this epic, kick-ass love story?

439
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,620
I mean, I am making peyton's wedding dress.

440
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,180
That actually might be a great way to end it, you know?

441
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,750
And I could always play me.

442
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,200
All right.

443
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,600
Yeah, here we go.

444
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,920
I guess I can consider you on board, then, huh?

445
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,990
Yeah.

446
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,940
For the record, that dress is unbelievable.

447
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,160
Well.

448
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,070
you're kind of talented, brooke davis.

449
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,080
Well, you are not so bad yourself, lucas scott.

450
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,780
Hey.

451
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,870
Could you really call natalie?

452
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,230
Close friend. So much fun.

453
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,870
Good to know.

454
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,840
Are there things that you've learned through 
all of this adversity, nathan?

455
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,970
I mean, do you ever think that maybe the struggle 

456
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,100
and the setbacks have made you a better person?

457
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,100
I guess so.

458
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,110
I mean, I like to think that 
if I would have made it to the nba out of maryland, 

459
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,390
I'd still be a good guy.I hope so.

460
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,440
Mouth?

461
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,120
We're about to roll out any second.

462
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,300
Okay.let's cut and grab another tape.

463
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,320
Sure thing, sexy.

464
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,940
Sorry. I was talking to nathan.

465
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,980
You know, one of the biggest lessons I ever learned is 

466
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,220
never to flirt with cute girls 
that aren't your wife or your girlfriend.

467
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,120
What? You don't mean gigi?

468
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,100
No, I'm not talking about the hot college girl you used to date.

469
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,060
Why would I be talking about her?

470
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,350
Look, millie's a rock star. Don't screw that up.

471
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,690
- Be right back, okay? 
- Okay.

472
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,750
Man, what the hell?

473
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,060
Without me, you'd be sitting on the bench shooting jump shots.

474
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,430
And you get the interview?

475
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,340
I'm telling you -- I get no love.

476
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,720
You want me to hook you up?

477
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,740
Tell you what -- you keep the interview.

478
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,730
Why don't you hook me up with brooke instead?

479
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,100
That girl's so over me.

480
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,940
Well, she's had a tough run lately.

481
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,800
But on the list of 100 things you screwed up in your life, 

482
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,820
I'd say losing brooke davis is number 1 through 99.

483
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,810
What's the other one?

484
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,770
That haircut.

485
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,160
Or the drug addiction. One of the two.

486
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,220
Excuse me.

487
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,420
Does your mother let you skateboard on her hardwood floors?

488
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:43,570
Oh, you've been saved by the bell, my friend.

489
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,530
You should go play in sam's room.And by "play,"

490
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:49,050
I do not mean smoke anything, 
drink anything, or burn the house down, okay?

491
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,010
Hey, brooke.

492
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,530
No way.You cannot have him back already.He just got here.

493
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,750
Who? Jamie?

494
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,970
You can totally keep him.The kid's a menace.

495
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,760
I'm here to talk to you about owen.

496
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,530
And since when do you have owen's back?

497
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,960
Since he's standing right next to me.

498
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,850
Hey.

499
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,470
You should tell your little friend owen that 

500
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,080
if he has something to say to me, 

501
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:20,720
he can talk to me himself and 
stop being so 7th grade about it.

502
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,770
Dude, if you have something to say to her, 

503
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,940
you should say it yourself and 
stop being so 7th grade about it.

504
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,120
Hi.

505
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,450
Hello.

506
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,260
What you doing?

507
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,370
Texting.

508
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,300
About what?

509
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,670
Party.

510
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,320
Want to go?

511
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,810
why don't you just use the door?

512
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,870
Because it's more like an adventure.

513
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,540
Like "goonies.

514
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,070
" What's "goonies"?

515
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,750
Dude, you totally did not just ask me that.

516
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,200
You ever done anything wild?

517
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:06,680
I got kidnapped by my nanny once,

518
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,430
chased through a cornfield,

519
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,120
and fell in a swimming pool...

520
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,820
And anything on purpose?

521
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,500
All right, well, it's a lot more fun 
when it's on purpose.

522
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,590
So you want to go to the party or what?

523
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,530
Is there a moonbounce?

524
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,320
There's moonshine.

525
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,760
Okay.

526
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:50,220
Well, well, the site of our historic throwdown.

527
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,530
You want a rematch?

528
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,560
Careful now.

529
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,890
Besides, that's how I met lucas.

530
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:59,470
The night we had to deal with the crazy white fake me, 

531
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:04,510
- and now you can laugh - it's funny.

532
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,790
And you and lucas are getting married?

533
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,970
Doing pretty good, peyton.

534
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,630
You're doing good.

535
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,830
I didn't mean anything about you still being a marine.

536
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,360
I think we're all looking for a life 
that makes sense somehow, 

537
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,190
and I am very, very happy for you that you found that.

538
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,760
And have you found it?

539
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:28,280
Yes. I have.

540
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,530
I mean, it sneaks up on you, right?

541
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,780
But one day, you look at your life, and 

542
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:37,860
it has purpose and someone that 
makes you feel very special and friends.

543
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,580
And it's like, all of a sudden, 
all the time and pain that

544
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,790
 it took to get there, 
it just doesn't matter anymore.

545
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,410
Yeah, I've been waiting to hear you say that 

546
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,180
since you stood in this ring and started fighting back.

547
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:57,370
Look, I know that mick hurt you by 
not being the kind of father you needed him to be, 

548
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,100
but you made it anyway, you know?

549
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,710
You've got people pinning medals on you.

550
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:07,590
And so, maybe all the pain it took for you to get here 

551
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,810
doesn't matter anymore for you, too, big brother.

552
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,490
Maybe.

553
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,110
Well, I have to get going, but I had an idea.

554
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:23,920
I own a small record label, 
and I have some connections back from my years in L.A.

555
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:27,880
How about we do that U.S.O.Show?

556
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,410
You'd do that?

557
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,920
Sure.

558
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,750
That's what family does, right?

559
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,570
Sounds perfect.

560
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,880
Okay.

561
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,470
Come on, I'll walk you out.

562
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:49,430
Great.All these years, 
and you'll get me busted down to private.

563
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:56,920
Hey.

564
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,150
Hey. What's up?

565
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:02,220
Oh, I just dropped off the little monster 
at brooke's for the sleepover, 

566
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,520
and, it's just nathan and I tonight.

567
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,410
Bow chicka bow bow 

568
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:13,560
very funny.Actually, I was thinking about 
playing a little piano, taking a nice long bath.

569
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,530
And then.bow chicka bow.

570
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,870
sorry.

571
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:24,120
Speaking of bad pornos, how was your movie offer?

572
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,460
Nice.

573
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,440
No, I don't know.I'm actually about to
 go meet the producer to talk about it.

574
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,090
So, you think you're gonna do it?

575
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,300
My agent thinks I'd be crazy not to.

576
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,520
Cool.

577
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,750
'Cause I was thinking of ellen page for me.

578
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,930
And I was thinking ellen page for mia.

579
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,250
Mia? She's not even in your book.

580
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:43,080
Right. I just thought I'd write her in.

581
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:47,170
Great. That little brat steals my life, 
and now she steals my wish-list actor.

582
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,720
And not to mention I'm totally screwing with you.

583
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,720
So, how you doing with slamball?

584
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,350
You know, I've got a husband with a bad back, 

585
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,070
and he's playing a game called slamball, 

586
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,100
so you just let me know when I can breathe again.

587
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,130
Haley, he's gonna be okay.

588
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,940
Look, nathan wants what he wants, 

589
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,460
but he's gonna do it smarter this time.

590
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:15,680
I mean, he knows that he has the best wife 

591
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,650
and son ever to consider in all this.

592
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:22,050
Yeah.He has been really sweet through all of it.

593
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:29,120
In fact, I think I'm gonna go home and 
visit with my sweet husband.

594
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,080
Bow chicka bow wow 

595
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,390
Julian.

596
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,690
Hey. Glad you made it.

597
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,390
I hope you don't mind.
I got a -- I got a thing for dive bars.

598
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,890
You ever been here before?

599
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,390
It's a joke.

600
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,850
Not a good one, but.

601
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:56,880
no, I-I know this is your spot.
I always wanted to see the infamous tric.

602
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,750
It sounds like you've done your research.

603
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:02,330
Luke, I'm so inside this story.
I can't get it out of my head.

604
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,130
Look, I, uh -- I checked out your credits, 
and you're for real.

605
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:10,610
But,  this story's really personal, you know?

606
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,740
That's why I want you to write the screenplay.

607
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,850
What?

608
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,930
There's no one else that can tell this story.

609
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,310
It's your voice, luke.

610
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,220
On top of that, you'll find that the screen trade 
pays a hell of a lot more than your book deal.

611
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,150
It's not about the money.

612
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,520
Okay, okay.

613
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,240
With you, I may actually believe that.
Nevertheless, six figures.

614
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,340
Really?

615
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,540
100 grand?

616
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,310
More like 300 grand, 

617
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,030
and another three if we get the movie made, 
and I'll get the movie made.

618
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,360
So, in the book, it says peyton moved to L.A.
Did she like it there?

619
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,960
Yeah, she loved it there.

620
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,190
Well, if this works out -- and it will -- 

621
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,790
you're gonna be a successful screenwriter.
You could visit her.

622
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:56,990
Well, actually, she lives here now. We're engaged.

623
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,720
Well, the world loves a happy ending.

624
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,980
Listen, you don't know me, 
but I honestly feel as though I know you.

625
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,090
If you option this book to me, 
I'll give you complete control of the script.

626
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,710
We'll do this thing together.

627
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,690
Come on, what do you say?

628
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,440
Trying something new?

629
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,810
Yeah.

630
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,080
Let me hear.

631
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,550
Okay.

632
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,000
Well, what?

633
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,440
Sorry. Nothing.

634
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,020
Oh. Okay.

635
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,150
What -- what is wrong with you?

636
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,310
I can't play with you making faces like that.

637
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,890
I know. Neither can I.

638
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,790
You're so funny.

639
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,940
We were worried about you.

640
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,350
My back is fine. I promise.

641
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,120
Okay.

642
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,620
Well, it's too bad, 'cause, you know, 

643
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,340
jamie's sleeping over at brooke's, and,

644
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:18,360
I thought maybe you'd want a little massage.
But, you know, it's fine.

645
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,770
Well, it's not perfect.As a matter of fact, I was thinking.

646
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,110
maybe you could just carry me upstairs tonight?

647
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,470
- Carry? 
- Is that okay?

648
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,770
I made a mistake.

649
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,790
I was into you.

650
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,530
I am into you. I just -- 

651
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,270
Look.

652
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,950
I'm an idiot.

653
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,350
Just hold that thought.

654
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,030
Brooke, there's a problem at the -- oh.

655
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,790
Owen.

656
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,220
Imagine that.

657
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,360
Sorry. There's a problem at the store.

658
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,950
The nosy guy across the street called 
and said he saw someone breaking in.

659
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,510
- Call the police. 
- No.

660
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,070
- Brooke. 
- No!

661
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,870
Fine. I'll go.

662
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,230
No. I will go.

663
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,760
I just need to tell sam to watch jamie.
And I need to get my gun.

664
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,170
Wait. What?

665
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,050
Hey, sam.

666
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,600
I should have brought the gun.

667
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,610
Brooke.

668
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,740
Oh, my god.

669
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,790
Brooke.

670
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,380
I'm gonna kill her.

671
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,280
Come here.

672
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,050
- Will you take him? 
- Yeah, I got him.

673
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,300
Sam!

674
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,720
What the hell are you doing?

675
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,080
I told you I could fill this place up.

676
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,630
First of all, you are 15 years old.

677
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,720
Second, you kidnapped a 5-year-old child, 
you adolescent nanny carrie!

678
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:19,400
And third, you are breaking and 
entering in the place where I work!

679
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,830
This is the place.

680
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,460
that is peyton's wedding dress.

681
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,400
Oh, dude, chill out. It's fine. It's right.

682
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,370
oh, no. 

683
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,740
Where is it?

684
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,860
Everybody out!

685
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,680
Let's go! Now!

686
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,370
Everybody head out!

687
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,350
I'm sorry.

688
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,450
Get out!

689
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,150
Not you.

690
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,890
I make this shot, it's an equal producer credit, huh?

691
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,470
Co-producer.

692
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,220
Producer.

693
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,340
Just shoot.

694
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,570
I can't believe I just gave you a producer credit.

695
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,890
Here, hurry up and sign this before I change my mind.

696
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,750
you know, talk to peyton first.

697
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:48,030
You know what, my friend?That's exactly 
why this movie should be made.

698
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,600
Lucas scott and peyton sawyer made it.

699
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,850
They're together. It's inspiring.

700
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,140
This contract is simply an option.

701
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,210
It gives me exclusive rights to the book for six months  

702
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,110
to do everything I say I'm gonna do.

703
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:05,070
If not, all the rights revert back to you.

704
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,700
Yeah, I know.

705
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,990
I called my agent, and he thinks I should sign it, too, but.

706
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,550
he's a smart guy.

707
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,840
Okay.

708
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,780
Six months.

709
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,650
We are about to get so drunk.

710
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,280
I promise you this will go down in history as 
an epic day in your life, lucas.

711
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,460
I hope so.

712
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,210
I got to go call peyton.

713
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,960
Have her come meet us to celebrate.

714
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,900
All right

715
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,960
Thanks, buddy.

716
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,010
I'm really sorry, aunt brooke.

717
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,690
It's okay, jamie. It's not you I'm mad at.

718
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,210
It's sam, huh?

719
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,490
Yeah.

720
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,450
But I am a little bit mad at you.

721
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,750
You should have told me that you were leaving the house tonight.

722
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,770
You can't trust people when they're bad.

723
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:12,830
I know. But sam's not bad.

724
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,480
I don't know about that, buddy.

725
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:21,390
She's not. I think she's like quentin was 
when mama met him.

726
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,730
She's nice. She's just afraid to show it.

727
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,230
hey. You need any help?

728
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,020
No, I'm good. You should take off.

729
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,800
Okay.Uh, see you tomorrow?

730
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,320
Sure. Drive safe.

731
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:49,460
Hey, a bunch of my friends are gonna meet up 
for drinks later if you want to go.

732
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,900
Thanks. I should get home.

733
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:55,800
Okay. I had a great day with you, mouth.

734
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,930
It felt like old times.

735
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,180
Yeah, I had a great day, too.

736
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,830
Well, you better get back to the old ball and chain.

737
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,410
See you tomorrow.

738
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,070
I'm getting worried about slamball.

739
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,080
It's my fault.

740
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,770
I underestimated the speed of this game.

741
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,040
Some of these guys are great athletes.They're fast.

742
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,770
Well, you're gonna have to be faster, because

743
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:41,030
I don't know if I can handle another game like the last one.

744
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,520
I will be.

745
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,670
'Cause I know you're trusting me.

746
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,080
I love you for that.

747
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,560
she's on her way.She's just running a little late.

748
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,680
Maybe there's another guy.

749
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:07,130
Why did I sign that option again?

750
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,910
That reminds me -- I got to make a quick call.

751
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,450
I'll be right back, okay?

752
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,830
Hey, nice shot.

753
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,590
Nice everything. Wow, you look hot.

754
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,650
No, I don'T. I was like a tornado at home.

755
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,920
Um, where's this producer?
I need to ply him with many questions.

756
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,490
He had to make a call on his cell.

757
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,850
Okay.Well, in that case, I'm gonna go check my handiwork.

758
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,770
Oh. You look so hot.

759
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,680
Bye.

760
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,200
I don't think detergent removes spray paint.

761
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,940
I know there's nothing I can say other than "I'm sorry.

762
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,020
I do these stupid things sometimes.

763
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,790
I really am sorry, though.

764
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,600
You were nice to me, but I'm just not worth it.

765
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,420
And where do you think you're going?

766
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,320
I don't know.

767
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,640
You're grounded.

768
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,700
You're not kicking me out?

769
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,970
No.And I hope that someday, 

770
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,980
you stop acting surprised when you hear that.

771
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,500
Now go to your room.Actually, go to my room,

772
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,440
 because the windows don't open.

773
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:29,640
- Can I just say about the party --  
- sam, I am so pissed off right now.

774
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,750
Go.

775
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,480
I'm sorry, jamie.

776
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,800
I think it's kind of cool.

777
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,340
You've gotten even more beautiful.

778
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,380
What are you doing here,julian?

779
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,490
Haven't you heard? I'm optioning your fiance's book.

780
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,510
Like hell you are. 

781
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,950
Actually, it's already done.

782
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,930
I'm quite charming.

783
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,780
But you know that, baby.

784
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,590
Hey. There you are.

785
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,650
Well, I see you two have already met, huh?

786
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,870
Yes, we have.

787
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,280
And you know what, lucas?

788
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,530
It feels like I've known her for years.
