1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,869
Previously on one tree hill

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,269
********

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,029
I know that you saved my life,

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,579
And i'm gonna find a way to thank you.

5
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,029
I swam into the car, and i got trapped.

6
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,179
- I didn't save anybody.
- Somebod saved me

7
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,489
- Who?
- Keith.

8
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,799
What'd you say?

9
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:16,729
Keith's dead,peyton.

10
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,549
The boys in tree hill are so boring.

11
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,179
Isn't there anybody our age
you think you could fall for?

12
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,789
- Hey,ma,are you pregnant?
- Yes,i am.

13
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,299
Deb,you need to get back into rehab,

14
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,279
Or i will dissolve our partnership.

15
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,769
Maybe the ravens could
use another shooting guard.

16
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,189
I'm putting him on he team.

17
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,149
- What made you decide?
- You did.

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,029
I'm not the only one
who knows you killed me.

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,189
Shut up,you little smartass ghost.

20
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,669
You're definitely pregnant.

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,749
I was trying to call you.

22
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,769
You mean when you weren't
hanging out with peyton?

23
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,109
As far as i'm concerned,
this friendship is over.

24
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,959
I feel like i'm hanging on
to the two of us for you.

25
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,889
If you've been listening to my podcast,

26
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,529
Then you know a lot about me.

27
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,309
But did you know i had a brother?

28
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,069
Are you peyton? I guess i'm your brother.

29
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,709
Lucas: do you ever look
at a picture of yourself

30
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,899
And see a stranger in the background?

31
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,879
Makes you wonder how many
strangers have pictures of you.

32
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,949
Yeah,it figures the first
time a cheerleader talks to me,

33
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,369
We're related.

34
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,069
I haven't actually talked yet.

35
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,279
Well,you just did.

36
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,569
So this is a lot better than the other day

37
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,499
When you slammed the door in my face.

38
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,569
After you hung up on me when i called?

39
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,609
Well,you caught me off guard.

40
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,149
You think i was expecting you
to show up on my front porch?

41
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,839
According to your podcast,yes

42
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,139
I've known about you for a while now.

43
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,759
Didn't know if i wanted to meet you,

44
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,159
So when you called, it freaked me out,but...

45
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,999
I was curious.

46
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,659
Why didn't you just call me back?

47
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,219
I was afraid you'd hang up on me.

48
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,569
I'm sorry. Oka,look.

49
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,719
Let's start over.

50
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,769
Hi. I'm derek.

51
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,969
I guess i'm your brother.

52
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,439
Hi,drek. I'm peyton.

53
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,649
So,peyton, who'd you bring?

54
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,819
What do you mean?

55
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,409
Well,you do||t strike me as a dumb girl,

56
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,509
So||ho'd you bring as backup

57
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,419
In case i turned out to be a psycho?

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,919
Derek,Lucas.

59
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,029
Lucas,derek.

60
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,579
That guy seems really cool.

61
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,239
I mean,you throw a skirt
on him,and he's you.

62
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,399
- We are not that much alike.
- Oh,no.

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,639
He's a photographer. You're an artist.

64
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,689
You wouldn't shut up about
that damn moze||a album.

65
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,379
The same breakfast.

66
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,759
I mean, i thought that was cute.

67
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,349
We ordered scrambled eggs and toast,

68
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,919
Same as you, same as everybody else.

69
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,359
Okay,you know what? I quit.

70
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,619
You have absolutely nothing
in common with your brother.

71
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,509
I just don't know what
you want to do anymore

72
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,619
**so they can leave again.

73
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,359
Look,on the contrary to what
might be wpitten on your wall,

74
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,439
People don't always leave.

75
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,529
I mean,last time i checked, i'm still here.

76
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,319
So is nathan, haley,Brooke.

77
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,189
Okay, maybe not Brooke, but...

78
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,679
Yeah,i think she wishes we would leave.

79
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,149
Have you heard from her?

80
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,689
Not since she broke up with me.

81
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,379
Well,get your game face on and ta|| to her.

82
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,069
It's playoff time.

83
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,749
Everybody should be in a good mood.

84
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,909
I need to be tutored.

85
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,539
****

86
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,669
Did you try sleeping with the teacher?

87
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,579
So...

88
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,219
What's gotten into you?

89
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,219
I'm just tired of thinking
about the accident.

90
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,059
I need to get focused again and
start thinking about basketball.

91
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:36,949
All right.

92
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,079
And you.

93
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,349
You really are failing marriage,aren't you?

94
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,809
Yoe know i'm always
p@inking about you,hales.

95
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,279
Thank you for being so patient with me.

96
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,749
I just needed some time.

97
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,579
But after tonight,
everything's gonna be better.

98
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,689
I promise.

99
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,979
I'm really glad to see you so happy,

100
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,209
But i just don't know

101
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,539
If everything that happened to you on
the bridge is gonna go away so quickly.

102
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,379
You know,no matter what
goes wrong in my life,

103
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,649
Every time i set foot
on that basketball court,

104
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,219
It all goes away.

105
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,919
You'll see.

106
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,959
You nervous?

107
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,559
Skills: nah.

108
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,779
You lying?

109
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,979
Yeah.

110
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,069
Remember my first game as a raven?

111
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,499
Yeah.

112
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,009
You played like crap.

113
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,779
I remember walking around for a whole week

114
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,239
Talking about,"man, i
got to take me a Lucas."

115
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,799
Look,the point is,||

116
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,349
I let too much get to my head, you know?

117
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,049
I mean,basketball's basketball,

118
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,359
Whether it's on the river court or in here.

119
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,659
You remember that, and you'll be all right.

120
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,819
Yeah,i'd be a better if you
w
out there with me,though.

121
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,649
Well,i will be...

122
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,849
Sort of.

123
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,139
Wait. This is your jersey.

124
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,259
Not anymore.

125
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,449
Thanks,man.

126
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,899
Did you wash it?

127
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,699
Oh,man.

128
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,469
Man,i'm gonna make this place look good.

129
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,849
This||ersey,too.

130
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,469
***it ain't used to looking bad.

131
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,869
All right,keith.

132
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,299
Enough already.

133
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,059
Do you mind? I'm paying my respects.

134
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,399
I know|| made a mistake,

135
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,389
But i can't take it back.

136
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,969
And since neither of us is resting in peace,

137
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,819
I have a deal for you.

138
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,559
You stop haunting me,

139
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,659
And i'll make things right
with karen||Lucas,and your baby.

140
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,919
But if you don't leave me alon...

141
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,779
I think you know what i'm capable of.

142
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,449
Brooke: i swear to god, if we lose ton||ht,

143
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,069
I am||oing to kill peyton.

144
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,689
We will win. Nathan's
got that look in his eye.

145
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,719
Even if we did lose, it
wouldn't be peyton's fault.

146
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,629
Yes,it would. Everything is peyton's fault.

147
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,389
She's like a cursed rabbit's foot.

148
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,879
She's bad luck.

149
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,829
I am serious, traitor girl.

150
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,829
Do not take her side, not against me.

151
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,689
Do not call me traitor girl,okay?

152
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,559
I'm not taking sides. I
didn't know there were sides.

153
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,929
You're either on team Brooke or team peyton,

154
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,359
And nobody wants to be on team peyton

155
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,139
Because their captain is a big whore.

156
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,939
Okay,do you think that's a little harsh?

157
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,409
You mean "harsh" like when they sho||
their tongues down each other's throats?

158
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,999
That kiss was so long ago.

159
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,419
Again,haley. They kissed again.

160
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,149
What?

161
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,559
They're ||eaking around again,too.

162
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,209
You should really check out
peyton's webcam sometime.

163
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,229
Welcome to team Brooke.

167
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,859
Trade you my juice box
for your bag of chips.

168
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,219
And i'll tow in a cookie.

169
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,289
Peyton must really need chips.

170
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,229
Okay,how can i make this any clearer?

171
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,539
There's nothing going
on between me and peyton.

172
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,349
And there's nothing going
on between us,either,

173
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,419
So why are you still here?

174
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,389
Do i need to make that clearer?

175
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,889
You know what,Brooke? You broke up with me.

176
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,829
Then you never even gave
me a real reason why.

177
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,739
You just walked away.

178
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:48,479
||T i thought we could
at least still be friends.

179
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,809
Thanks.

180
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,639
Anything i can do to help?

181
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,209
Yeah ... Leave deb alone.

182
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,219
Is she here?

183
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,249
No,she quit. And i'm swamped.

184
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,839
**

185
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,899
Deb is back on drugs,
and she's carrying a gun.

186
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,599
She didn't have any matches, did she?

187
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,569
Look,she needs help,

188
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,759
So stop whatever it is you're doing to her.

189
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,449
I'm not doing anything.

190
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,329
You're always doing
something, and it's never good.

191
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,909
Look,you said phat you
wanted to be a better person.

192
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,409
Here's your chance. Take it.

193
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,919
Okay,karen.

194
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,919
**

195
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,779
Do it for you.

196
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,779
And for the womn you once claimed to love.

197
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,529
That was the most morbid
tour i have ever been on.

198
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,169
Not everybody gets to go
on the tree hill death walk,

199
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,289
So you should probably feel pretty honored.

200
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,719
Oh,i do.

201
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,199
My favorite part was the bridge
where your friends crashed.

202
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,099
You know,it's just too
bad i ran out of time,

203
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,579
'Cause i really wanted to show you the place

204
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,559
Where i buri|| my prom date.

205
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,339
- Kidding.
- Thank god,

206
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,129
Be really weipd if we had
another thing in common.

207
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,109
So,i want to ask you something.

208
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,009
Are you okay with me being here?

209
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,319
You've kind of had your guard up all day.

210
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,329
I'm sorry. That's just me.

211
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,589
I don't let people in, really.

212
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,439
It's okay. I mean,i get
it. I'm the same way.

213
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,779
Look,peyton,i'd like to
hang around a little bit

214
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,759
And get to know you,

215
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,049
But if you're ont comfortable
with it,i understand.

216
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:30,029
I will check out of my hotel and head home.

217
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,009
At the very least,we had
one great day together.

218
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,499
So you just let me know,okay?

219
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,269
I'll see you.

220
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,669
There's a game tonight an

221
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,189
**if you want to go.

222
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,039
Yeah.

223
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,119
Yeah,i'd ... I'd like that.

224
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,419
Crap.

225
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,079
That pretty much sums up this seaso

226
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,469
You started out this year
with a crappy attitude.

227
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,659
You played like crap. You took my crap.

228
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,949
You cleaned up rat crap from a crappy gym.

229
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,569
We||,all that crap's over now.

230
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,159
At least you made it to the finals.

231
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,629
Some of you are seniors.

232
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,149
This is your last chance for a state title.

233
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,079
It's my last chance.

234
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,779
So get out there and play like
the champions i know you can be.

235
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:41,649
Ladies and gentlemen, let's make
some noise for your tree hill ravens.

236
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,849
Okay,fans, you are in for a treat.

237
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,599
Tonight,we are lucky to
be joined by Lucas scott,

238
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,189
Former ravens shooting guard.

239
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,789
Very lucky...

240
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,729
And aroused.

241
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,209
Yes,very lucky.

242
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,789
Before tonight's game,

243
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,169
Mayor dan scott is here

244
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,129
To present an award to
one of our very own ravens.

245
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,459
A week ago,my son,||nathan sco

246
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,369
Risked his life to save two people.

247
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,689
This act of bravery and selflessness

248
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,479
In the face of grave danger

249
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,689
Is a quality i most hoped to inspire in him.

250
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,249
And i'm happy to say that i succeeded.

251
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,559
On behalf of tree hill,

252
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:27,039
I'd like to present this award of valor

253
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,319
To my son,nathan scott.

254
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,799
Thank you,hero.

255
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,149
I'm proud of you,son.

256
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,999
Let's play ball.

257
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,699
Stay the hell away from my husband.

258
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,409
I was just giving him
a proper "thank you."

259
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,569
Your thank-Yous send
people to the free clinic.

260
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,639
What are you laughing about?

261
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,639
Your "i love yous" send
people to their grave.

262
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,019
Well,if that's the case,
then i love you,Brooke.

263
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,369
Whore.

264
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,889
Okay,here we go. It's
tree hill versus masonboro.

265
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,139
The winner advances in the
postseason,and the ravens win the tip.

266
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,829
Nathan scott has it out on the wing.

267
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:22,139
Nathan drive||past his
defender,and he scores.

268
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,639
Than has it out on the wing again.

269
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,869
He puts up a shot, and he scores.

270
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,419
As some fans know,

271
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,609
Nathan injured his knee
in that heroic rescue,

272
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,669
But he's showing no ill effects tonight.

273
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,929
He's playing4 like a man
possessed,and he drives again.

274
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,579
Masonboro with it now on the offensive end.

275
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,979
They drive to the basket, and they score.

276
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,469
||Masonboro is keeping it close.

277
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,549
I can't believe whitey
ain't put me in the game,man.

278
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,249
Yeah,whatever.

279
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,389
I've been on this team for two years,

280
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,169
And i haven't played one game yet.

281
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,349
Yeah,but i'm good.

282
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,679
Scott drives to the hoop, d he's fouled.

283
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,899
He'll step to the line for
a couple of free throws.

284
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,799
Nathan scott steps to the free-Throw line.

285
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,559
He's a perfect 6 for 6
tonight. He's got 12 points.

286
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,969
And now 13.

287
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,289
Nathan has a second free throw coming.

288
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,909
Second free throw is up.

289
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,929
Oh,and he misses. That's his first miss.

290
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,489
Are you guys tired?

291
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,129
I know i am.

292
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,749
But,then again,i'm old.

293
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,059
And you guys are young,

294
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,919
And you've been sleeping
the entire first half.

295
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,799
Wake up!

296
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:23,489
We should be blowing these
guys out,not down by 5.

297
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,599
Scott,you haven't hit a shot

298
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,449
Since you stepped up to the free-Throw line

299
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,829
In the first quarter.

300
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,759
Is there something i should know?

301
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,009
I'll be okay,coach.

302
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,069
- Hey
- Hey,big mouth.

303
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,889
Other than you saying it,

304
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,649
There is nothing tt i
like about that nickname.

305
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,769
It's good to have you back.

306
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,509
Yeah.

307
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,609
I am much happier in my cheer uniform

308
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,629
Than i was in that hospital gown.

309
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,179
Then again,the gown was
drafty in different places.

310
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,249
I'll bet.

311
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,629
Um,so listen, cooper's gone and,um...

312
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,419
Well,you know how i feel about you.

313
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,629
I know.

314
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,659
I'm really lucky to have you,mouth.

315
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,449
You're a good friend.

316
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,149
A good friend.

317
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,709
Great friend?

318
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,819
You don't want m|| mouth.

319
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,369
I'm a mess.

320
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,659
I got to get back to my broadcast.

321
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,879
You know y'all are missing
something out there,right?

322
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,229
Want to know what it is?

323
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,669
Let me guess ... You.

324
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,439
Same old story,dog.

325
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,319
Whitey trying to keep a brother down.

326
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,289
Look,somebody got to tell the old man

327
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,209
They don't call me skill||

328
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,069
'Cause i'm really good at
picking splinters out my ass.

329
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,129
They don't call him skills

330
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,329
'Cause he's really good at||picking s@li

331
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,779
All right,skills.

332
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,039
Let's see what you've got.

333
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:07,249
God forbid whitey should k||p you down.

334
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,379
You're welcome.

335
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,429
So skills taylor has checked in the game

336
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,839
For his first time as a
raven, and he's wasting no time

337
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,109
As he drives to the basket and scores!

338
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,129
Yo,man,you're as easy
to score on as your mom.

339
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,029
Oh,my fault. Ain't nobody that easy.

340
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,879
Give me the ball. Got to have "d," boy.

341
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,519
Better protect the ball.

342
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,629
Skills with the steal.

343
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,159
He knocks the ball away, picks it up.

344
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,849
He throws it ahead to nathan scott.

345
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,209
Nathan racing up court,

346
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,669
And nathan's gonna lay it in for 2.

347
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,019
Skills,go!

348
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,029
As most of you know,
Lucas scott was co-Captain

349
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,399
Until he was sidelined for health reasons.

350
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,339
It must be tough to go from
playing the game to watching it.

351
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,469
Well,i'd be lying if i
said i didn't miss it,

352
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,589
But i'm really happy for
my friend,skill||taylor.

353
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,249
First night when you
step out onto the floor.

354
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,849
That's the one thing, you know?

355
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,599
You never want to give it back.

356
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,409
We in my bedroom?

357
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,379
'Cause i can go all damn night.

358
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,129
Like i said ... All damn night,baby.

359
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,369
Now drink up.

360
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,179
Let's go!

361
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,389
It's like rachel wants people to hate her.

362
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,529
I mean,first of all, she goes
after Lucas just to upset Brooke,

363
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,329
And then she gets drunk
and nearly kills cooper.

364
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,449
Now she's throwing herself at you.

365
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,759
Yeah,that sucks.

366
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,009
That sucks?

367
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,309
What's wrong? The ravens
won. Aren't you happy?

368
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,829
Yeah. I just think maybe you
should go easy on her. ****

369
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,259
She caused the accident.

370
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,769
Yeah,you're right. Let's just go inside.

371
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,139
A peace offering?

372
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,099
We're not at war.

373
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,459
Could have fooled me.

374
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,839
I'm on dw-Not-I duty tonight.

375
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,119
Want some company?

376
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,289
Uh-Oh ... Here comes
the brookie monster.

377
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,039
Welcome to my house.

378
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,079
Did you come to steal it?

379
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,229
Um,it's rachel's house,

380
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,619
And i'm pretty sure you stole it from her.

381
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,069
Don't worry.

382
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,319
It'll just make her like you more.

383
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:01,333
What the hell are you doing?

384
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,600
What?

385
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,066
Kissing Derek.

386
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,999
Oh, i'm sorry, Peyton.
I can't help who i like.

387
00:20:07,035 --> 00:20:08,166
New boyfriend?

388
00:20:08,556 --> 00:20:10,032
He's my brother.

389
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:11,361
You have a brother?

390
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:12,899
Yeah.

391
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:14,233
Well.

392
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:16,700
Then i guess your mom slept
around even more than you do.

393
00:20:21,768 --> 00:20:22,603
Hey, yo!

394
00:20:22,604 --> 00:20:24,434
Look, i just got to thank the brother

395
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:26,666
Who helped a brother get on the team.

396
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:29,633
And the brother who helped a
brother score once he got there.

397
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:31,522
I lost track. Which one am i again?

398
00:20:31,576 --> 00:20:33,666
So what's up, man?
How about some shots?

399
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:34,999
You blew up out there

400
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,160
But it's only gonna get tougher,

401
00:20:36,196 --> 00:20:37,619
So you got to keep
bringing it, all right?

402
00:20:37,655 --> 00:20:39,870
Look, man, i'm gonna be
so tight out there, dog,

403
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,483
They about to be calling me ziploc.

404
00:20:41,484 --> 00:20:43,402
Just say you're gonna bring it, skills.

405
00:20:43,403 --> 00:20:45,560
And you... Missed
you out there tonight.

406
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:47,346
Hey, you guys playad great.

407
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:49,001
Still missed you.

408
00:20:50,352 --> 00:20:53,921
Look, i just got to thank you For
going to the white man for me, dog.

409
00:20:53,922 --> 00:20:56,404
So, look, just to show my appreciation,

410
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:58,966
I sent Bevin on a little
spy mission for you.

411
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:04,266
Okay, big news,
but keep it on the blt.

412
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,566
Brooke broke up with Lucas.

413
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,266
Thanks, Bevin.

414
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,233
Yeah.

415
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:21,633
Mouth, hey, how you doing?

416
00:21:22,112 --> 00:21:23,333
i want to introduce you to Derek.

417
00:21:23,334 --> 00:21:25,166
Derek, this is
my great friend Mouth.

418
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:26,932
I'm everybody's great friend.

419
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,079
Right, um, look.

420
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,968
The line to the bathroom's
longer than the line to the keg,

421
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:31,967
So would you mind hanging out
with Derek for a couple minutes?

422
00:21:31,968 --> 00:21:34,333
Sure. That's what friends
are for, right?

423
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,300
Thank you.

424
00:21:36,334 --> 00:21:37,667
It's good to meet you, man.

425
00:21:38,994 --> 00:21:41,100
What'd you say
your name was... Cooper?

426
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:42,366
It's Derek.

427
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,066
Whatever, fe||x.

428
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,033
You ever been a girl's friend? It sucks.

429
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:50,099
you know what eles sucks? Yo new guys.

430
00:21:50,534 --> 00:21:51,966
My name's Derek.

431
00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:53,066
Right.

432
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,667
Look, if you want to get
on my good side...

433
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:58,268
And you do...

434
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:00,672
Stop kissing Brooke,
don't even look at Rachel,

435
00:22:00,673 --> 00:22:02,469
And don't move here,

436
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,669
'Cause nobody likes new guys,
new guy.

437
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:09,215
What was i talking about?

438
00:22:09,451 --> 00:22:11,649
You don't like new guys.

439
00:22:11,885 --> 00:22:13,689
Oh, yeah.

440
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,833
Damn new guys.

441
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:33,215
I was told to stay away from you.

442
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,809
Since when do you do
what you're been told?

443
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,665
Since never.

444
00:22:39,144 --> 00:22:40,191
Let me guess.

445
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:43,768
You liked my last kiss
so much, you want another?

446
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:46,986
Guess again.

447
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:49,765
So what, then?

448
00:22:51,267 --> 00:22:52,626
When we were underwater,

449
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:55,272
Did you see anything?

450
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,946
The last thing i remember is
the limo going off the bridge,

451
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:02,262
Then waking up in the hospital.

452
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,200
Nothing else?

453
00:23:04,894 --> 00:23:07,104
Just you saving my life.

454
00:23:07,105 --> 00:23:08,693
Why?

455
00:23:10,441 --> 00:23:11,367
Forget it.

456
00:23:11,861 --> 00:23:13,499
Nathan, wait. I...

457
00:23:15,234 --> 00:23:17,629
My memory's still a little hazy.

458
00:23:18,034 --> 00:23:20,087
Bud if i do remember something

459
00:23:20,123 --> 00:23:21,922
You'll be the first to know.

460
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,179
Thank you.

461
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,625
What, are you gonna kiss her now, too?

462
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,628
Excuse me for a second.
What?!

463
00:23:46,196 --> 00:23:49,175
Brooke told me that
you kissed Peyton again.

464
00:23:49,426 --> 00:23:52,131
||Ke, that's the dumbest thing you've
done Since the first time you kissed her.

465
00:23:52,132 --> 00:23:53,616
What the hell were you thinking?

466
00:23:53,617 --> 00:23:55,794
at she was dying. was thinking

467
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,337
She's lying on my arm,
blood is pouring out of her leg,

468
00:23:58,373 --> 00:24:00,258
<i>And she kissed me.</i>

469
00:24:00,294 --> 00:24:03,888
Well, anyway, you know,
do you really want to go there?

470
00:24:03,924 --> 00:24:04,736
What does that mean?

471
00:24:04,772 --> 00:24:07,584
What leg were you shot in
when you kissed chris keller?

472
00:24:25,793 --> 00:24:28,195
Brooke, got a second?

473
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:37,376
- This kind of feels like dxxxxxx
- Not really.

474
00:24:38,168 --> 00:24:40,492
You told me to fight for you, and i did.

475
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:42,808
But you never fought for me.

476
00:24:42,844 --> 00:24:44,995
And i'm not going to.

477
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:47,080
Okay.

478
00:24:47,436 --> 00:24:49,479
Then i guess i was wrong.

479
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:52,827
I'm not the guy for you, Brooke davis.

480
00:24:52,922 --> 00:24:54,497
She's all yours.

481
00:25:08,218 --> 00:25:09,373
What's up, Mouth?

482
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:13,162
*****That's all you ever say.

483
00:25:15,944 --> 00:25:17,096
You been drinking?

484
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:18,721
The party sucks.

485
00:25:18,722 --> 00:25:20,306
Yeah.
I know what you mean.

486
00:25:20,308 --> 00:25:21,699
Yeah, i'm sure you do.

487
00:25:21,735 --> 00:25:23,799
'Cause every time you
tell a girl you like her,

488
00:25:23,914 --> 00:25:26,113
She says what a great
friend you are, right?

489
00:25:26,762 --> 00:25:28,384
Oh, wait. That's me.

490
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,547
You're the guy they all
throw themselves at...

491
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,013
Brooke, Rachel, Peyton,

492
00:25:33,047 --> 00:25:34,979
Probably evel new guy.

493
00:25:37,147 --> 00:25:39,280
How many of those have you had?

494
00:25:39,687 --> 00:25:40,746
Counting this one?

495
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,423
One.

496
00:25:53,748 --> 00:25:56,443
I'm sorry. I'm an idiot.

497
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:58,225
I shouldn't have come at you like that.

498
00:25:59,047 --> 00:26:00,546
I'm sorry, too.

499
00:26:00,581 --> 00:26:02,300
I hate Rachel.

500
00:26:02,447 --> 00:26:04,346
You know, she probably just...

501
00:26:04,381 --> 00:26:05,994
Oh, i hate her, too.

502
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,446
I'm really sorry about you and Brooke.

503
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:10,454
Me too.

504
00:26:10,884 --> 00:26:13,844
She's probably going
through a lot right now.

505
00:26:14,013 --> 00:26:16,981
Yeah, well, she's just gonna
have to go through it alone.

506
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,713
Hey, look, will you
promise me something?

507
00:26:19,748 --> 00:26:20,348
Mm-Hmm.

508
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:22,349
No matter what happens,

509
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:25,037
You and i will always be friends.

510
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:27,546
Always.

511
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:29,747
and forever.

512
00:26:37,947 --> 00:26:40,513
I saw you co over here all by yourself.

513
00:26:40,547 --> 00:26:42,413
That used to be our signal.

514
00:26:42,777 --> 00:26:44,246
You okay?

515
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,192
Yeah. I'm just thinking.

516
00:26:47,914 --> 00:26:49,598
About Keith?

517
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,929
What about him?

518
00:26:50,965 --> 00:26:53,485
Lucas told me you saw him
the day of the accident.

519
00:26:54,748 --> 00:26:56,804
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

520
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,798
No, i'm not embarrassed.

521
00:26:57,834 --> 00:26:59,397
I just don't know if
i should believe it.

522
00:26:59,433 --> 00:27:01,385
What don't you believe...
That it could happen,

523
00:27:01,421 --> 00:27:03,148
Or that it could happen to you?

524
00:27:03,607 --> 00:27:05,959
Either. Both.

525
00:27:06,229 --> 00:27:08,602
I used to feel that way
when my mom died.

526
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,980
You know, i go and i visit
her grave all the time,

527
00:27:10,982 --> 00:27:14,019
I really think there isn't much talk to the rock

528
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,331
It's not crazy to think
That someone you cared about

529
00:27:18,367 --> 00:27:20,599
and lost Might still be watching you.

530
00:27:21,075 --> 00:27:22,924
What if he did more than just watch?

531
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,647
What if he actually saved me?

532
00:27:24,681 --> 00:27:26,597
Well, so what if he did?

533
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,048
Do you think he saved you
so you could just sit here

534
00:27:29,084 --> 00:27:31,888
All by yourself and pout?

535
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,971
If you ever want to come with
me to the cemetery sometime,

536
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:39,912
Maybe the four of us
can have a picnic.

537
00:27:43,325 --> 00:27:44,613
Come on.

538
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:51,540
Yo, nate, don't forget your award.

539
00:27:55,224 --> 00:27:56,690
It's not mine.

540
00:28:06,864 --> 00:28:08,373
If you're looking for Nathan,

541
00:28:09,469 --> 00:28:10,985
He's in my bedroom.

542
00:28:11,021 --> 00:28:13,766
If you're looking for
a black eye, it's in my fist.

543
00:28:15,518 --> 00:28:18,059
Why do you always go after
guys that you can't have?

544
00:28:19,671 --> 00:28:20,800
Let me know if you see any.

545
00:28:20,836 --> 00:28:23,518
I would, except i heard he left town.

546
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:27,623
I understand why you're so angry, hey.

547
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,660
I used to be a fat chick
with a litple head, too.

548
00:28:34,904 --> 00:28:36,549
Hey, what's up, Mouth?

549
00:28:37,939 --> 00:28:39,402
Hey, Mouth.

550
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,332
You all right?

551
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:46,975
I wish none of us ever
left the river court.

552
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,292
We were all happy back the

553
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:55,480
Well, look, i'm gonna take off.

554
00:28:55,516 --> 00:28:57,254
You need a lift?

555
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:00,181
Nah, i think i'm gonna stay
for a while.

556
00:29:00,427 --> 00:29:01,698
Okay.

557
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:03,313
Just call me
if you need a ride.

558
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:05,179
Hey, you too.

559
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:32,646
Can i talk to you?

560
00:29:33,881 --> 00:29:36,312
Not if you're gonna yell at me.

561
00:29:39,348 --> 00:29:42,434
I wanted to ask you
about basketball.

562
00:29:45,213 --> 00:29:47,481
Wow, if you had a cigar
and scotch in your hand,

563
00:29:47,482 --> 00:29:48,530
I'd think i was deaming.

564
00:29:48,566 --> 00:29:52,536
- I knew this was a mistake.
- Karen, i'm sorry.

565
00:29:52,847 --> 00:29:54,759
What did you gant to know?

566
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,540
Why was having basketball
in your life so important?

567
00:30:00,304 --> 00:30:02,883
It's the only thing
i ever knew i was good at.

568
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:05,280
People counted on me,
and i never let them down.

569
00:30:05,316 --> 00:30:07,269
It's the best feeling
in the world.

570
00:30:08,352 --> 00:30:09,513
And when that went away,

571
00:30:09,547 --> 00:30:11,738
I didn't know
who i was anymore.

572
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:14,890
It's scary
when you lose your way.

573
00:30:15,226 --> 00:30:17,380
I don't know if you ever find it again.

574
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:22,932
But what brings you out here in the
middle of the night To ask about a game?

575
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,809
Lucas is missing it.

576
00:30:26,447 --> 00:30:28,412
And, uh, i just wanted to be sure

577
00:30:28,447 --> 00:30:30,936
He was gonna be okay without it.

578
00:30:32,406 --> 00:30:34,346
I'm not the right guy
to answer that.

579
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,781
Thank you.

580
00:30:40,387 --> 00:30:42,666
And thank you for the crib.

581
00:30:54,656 --> 00:30:56,935
Okay, i know that you were
drunk at t|| wedding

582
00:30:56,971 --> 00:30:58,980
And in a coma fnr the honeymoon,

583
00:30:59,014 --> 00:31:01,264
But just to keep you || to speed,

584
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,213
Nathan and haley are still married.

585
00:31:03,249 --> 00:31:04,780
Thanks for that update.

586
00:31:04,814 --> 00:31:07,205
I hate those cute couply newsletters.

587
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:11,256
Rachel, trying to steal a girl's
boyfriend is bad enough.

588
00:31:11,292 --> 00:31:14,064
Trying to steal a girl's husband
is unacceptable,

589
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,880
Especially when the couple
is Nathan ||d haley.

590
00:31:15,914 --> 00:31:16,875
They've been through enough.

591
00:31:16,911 --> 00:31:19,873
I'll make a note of that In my
"mind your own business" stationery.

592
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:21,785
No, because as one
of haley's bridesmaids,

593
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:25,589
<i>Making sure they stay together
is my business, so back off.</i>

594
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:28,533
She might be too classy to fight
you, But i will kick your little ass.

595
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:30,029
Oh, i think you're gonna
stay out of it.

596
00:31:30,065 --> 00:31:31,720
really? Why is that?

597
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,692
Because you're pregnant.

598
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:40,013
So, who is the father? Lucas?

599
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:41,832
You don't know jack unless
he was one of those guys

600
00:31:41,868 --> 00:31:44,540
Whose beanstalk you
climbed the other night.

601
00:31:44,576 --> 00:31:46,901
You gonna kiss your unborn baby
with that Mouth?

602
00:31:47,556 --> 00:31:49,379
You have been begging me to find out.

603
00:31:49,413 --> 00:31:52,385
You haven't been drinking.
You're making maternity clothes.

604
00:31:52,447 --> 00:31:55,968
And, uh, i found the pamphlets from
planned parenthood In you||nightstand.

605
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:56,966
What is that, bedtime reading...

606
00:31:57,102 --> 00:31:58,873
"The story of the knocked-Up
cheerleader"?

607
00:31:58,913 --> 00:32:00,437
You were looking through my drawers?

608
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:02,186
my house my drawers

609
00:32:02,222 --> 00:32:05,013
I was looking for condoms, Something
you probably should have been doing.

610
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:07,147
<i>I am not having this
conversation with ||u.</i>

611
00:32:07,181 --> 00:32:08,856
I was talking to your baby.

612
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,295
Being an artist must be reall easy.

613
00:32:21,841 --> 00:32:23,060
Excuse me?

614
00:32:23,072 --> 00:32:27,581
You can draw anything. If i wanted
to take a picture of a unicorn,

615
00:32:27,617 --> 00:32:29,038
I'd have to find one.

616
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:34,083
Oh, right, and then you'd have that
ever-So-Difficult task Of pushing a button.

617
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,320
Where are you seeing
||unicorn, anyway?

618
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:40,946
Oh, this one's amazing.

619
00:32:41,865 --> 00:32:44,446
It's so beautiful and tragic.

620
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,213
Great. Well, you picked
the one i didn't do.

621
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:50,712
Ellie drew that for me.

622
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,302
Oh, no, no, no, no. I can't.

623
00:32:58,338 --> 00:33:00,879
Ellie brought us together.
I want you to have it.

624
00:33:00,914 --> 00:33:03,630
I've seen enough of the angel
of death, anyway.

625
00:33:04,572 --> 00:33:06,145
Thank you, Peyton.

626
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,710
I'm gonna find a really
special place for this.

627
00:33:11,947 --> 00:33:14,547
Well, i should go.

628
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,080
Hey, listen.

629
00:33:18,114 --> 00:33:20,513
I know you haven't asked
about our father,

630
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:24,104
And i haven't volunteered much
because the truth is,

631
00:33:24,384 --> 00:33:26,146
I don't know anything, really.

632
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:29,538
I mean, other than he skipped
out on me At a pretty early age.

633
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,813
I'm sorry.

634
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,012
But i can tell you
what i do remember if you want.

635
00:33:37,214 --> 00:33:38,747
Maybe tomorrow?

636
00:33:40,348 --> 00:33:41,793
Sure.

637
00:33:42,414 --> 00:33:44,038
All right.

638
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,780
Thank you.

639
00:34:04,614 --> 00:34:05,979
You played a hell of a game.

640
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,622
Yeah, but it wasn't no
Lucas Scott game, though.

641
00:34:07,623 --> 00:34:09,609
No, it was a skills taylor game,

642
00:34:09,645 --> 00:34:11,469
And that's exactly what the team needed.

643
00:34:12,822 --> 00:34:15,839
Look, man, i'm sorry about the way
Everything went down with Brooke.

644
00:34:19,581 --> 00:34:21,580
You know what Mouth said?

645
00:34:21,614 --> 00:34:25,146
He said that he wished
we never left the river court.

646
00:34:25,372 --> 00:34:26,490
you think he is right?

647
00:34:26,577 --> 00:34:28,693
I think things would be a lot easier.

648
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:31,213
Now i know, if we never left,

649
00:34:31,249 --> 00:34:34,855
I wouldn't have lost Brooke twice.

650
00:34:35,128 --> 00:34:37,692
And Keith and jimmy
would still be alive.

651
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:44,113
Well, that's a real stupid way
to think, though, dog.

652
00:34:44,147 --> 00:34:45,912
I mean, considering,

653
00:34:45,947 --> 00:34:48,618
If you would have never left
the river court,

654
00:34:48,647 --> 00:34:52,046
You would have never
got with Brooke twice.

655
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,856
Your brother
would still be a stanger,

656
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:58,052
And rock star haley Scott...

657
00:34:58,088 --> 00:35:01,844
She'd probably be still
good old bookworm haley james.

658
00:35:03,247 --> 00:35:05,525
You can't hide from life, dog.

659
00:35:05,913 --> 00:35:07,345
Eventually, you got to live it.

660
00:35:07,346 --> 00:35:09,118
Like you did tonight.

661
00:35:09,154 --> 00:35:10,434
Don't sweat it, man.

662
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:14,799
Look, i got a feeling There's something
about to happen to you, real big,

663
00:35:14,898 --> 00:35:16,411
Right around the corner.

664
00:35:16,786 --> 00:35:18,509
Check.

665
00:35:32,914 --> 00:35:34,821
Thought i was rid of you.

666
00:35:35,157 --> 00:35:37,379
Guess you' not accepting my offer.

667
00:35:37,414 --> 00:35:40,519
Th||e's only one way
to get rid of me, danny.

668
00:35:41,325 --> 00:35:44,082
I think you know what it is.

669
00:36:09,614 --> 00:36:12,207
You keep going to that bridge.

670
00:36:12,808 --> 00:36:15,383
I never thought
i'd be jealous of a river.

671
00:36:17,847 --> 00:36:19,988
You know how much i like the water.

672
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,013
I'm really trying not to be jealous,
And i want to be understanding,

673
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:30,138
But, uh, it's really hard
with you sneaking around.

674
00:36:31,886 --> 00:36:33,341
I'm sorry.

675
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:37,786
I don't want you to be sorry.
I want you to let me in.

676
00:36:39,009 --> 00:36:41,037
Whatever it is, you know?

677
00:36:42,475 --> 00:36:45,271
Even if it has something
to do with Rachel.

678
00:36:47,384 --> 00:36:50,494
Even if you like her,
i just want you to tell me.

679
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:52,832
You think i like Rachel?

680
00:36:54,447 --> 00:36:55,662
Haley, i was just...

681
00:36:55,698 --> 00:36:58,589
I was just talking to her
about the accident.

682
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,553
I just wanted to know
if she saw him, too.

683
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,529
Saw who?

684
00:37:08,878 --> 00:37:10,402
Keith.

685
00:37:10,947 --> 00:37:13,780
I think he's the one that
pulled me out of that car.

686
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,537
I'm nobody's hero.

687
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,160
Why didn't you tell me?

688
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:20,800
Because i thought it would go away.

689
00:37:20,836 --> 00:37:23,710
I thought basketball would
fix it, but it didn't.

690
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:30,507
Your problems
are my problems.

691
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:33,374
I want us to figure this out together.

692
00:37:35,426 --> 00:37:37,159
And you're wrong.

693
00:37:37,377 --> 00:37:39,158
You're my hero.

694
00:37:44,314 --> 00:37:46,202
So you don't think i'm crazy?

695
00:37:46,238 --> 00:37:49,219
No, i do not think you're crazy.

696
00:37:53,421 --> 00:37:54,964
||You think i'm fat?

697
00:37:55,451 --> 00:37:58,590
Wh||? Of course not.

698
00:37:58,947 --> 00:38:02,459
- Do i have a little head?
- No.

699
00:38:03,006 --> 00:38:06,000
I love your head. Come here.

700
00:38:09,381 --> 00:38:12,192
So that's why you keep
going down to that bridge?

701
00:38:12,465 --> 00:38:14,183
For that.

702
00:38:14,995 --> 00:38:16,818
And...

703
00:38:19,124 --> 00:38:20,953
...for this.

704
00:38:24,947 --> 00:38:26,722

Had a great time 2nite. Thought
yyou might like this pic.

707
00:38:56,047 --> 00:38:57,713
<i>You ever look
at a picture of yourself</i>

708
00:38:57,749 --> 00:38:59,858
<i>And see a stranger
in the background?</i>

709
00:39:01,242 --> 00:39:04,306
<i>You know, it makes you wonder how
many strangers have pictures of you.</i>

710
00:39:05,864 --> 00:39:09,642
<i>How many moments of other
people's lives Have we been in?</i>

711
00:39:10,741 --> 00:39:14,520
<i>Were we a part of someone's
life When their dream came true?</i>

712
00:39:15,991 --> 00:39:19,329
<i>Or were we there
when their dreams died?</i>

713
00:39:25,181 --> 00:39:27,727
<i>Did we keep trying to get in</i>

714
00:39:28,936 --> 00:39:32,113
<i>As i||we were somehow
destined||o be there?</i>

715
00:39:36,064 --> 00:39:38,955
<i>Or did the shot take us by surprise?</i>

716
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:02,640
<i>Just think.</i>

717
00:40:03,121 --> 00:40:05,849
<i>You could be a big part
of someone else's life...</i>

718
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:13,516
<i>...and not even know it.</i>
