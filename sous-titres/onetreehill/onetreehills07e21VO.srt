1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,692
What are you talking about?

2
00:00:05,692 --> 00:00:06,976
The sex tape.

3
00:00:07,043 --> 00:00:08,677
I don't look as bad as if
I made it with my boyfriend.

4
00:00:08,745 --> 00:00:10,262
I'm being deported.

5
00:00:10,313 --> 00:00:12,131
Marrying me fixes everything.

6
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:13,782
I can't marry you.

7
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:16,235
Remember the tennis player that
wouldn't take no for an answer?

8
00:00:16,286 --> 00:00:17,386
That Katie girl?

9
00:00:17,454 --> 00:00:18,954
Why do you have a photo with her?

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:19,805
Because it's not her.

11
00:00:19,873 --> 00:00:21,006
It's Sara.

12
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:22,508
You'll never be Sara.

13
00:00:22,576 --> 00:00:23,826
Neither will you.

14
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,327
We'll see about that.

15
00:00:25,412 --> 00:00:28,230
Her behavior gets a little unpredictable.

16
00:00:28,298 --> 00:00:29,431
How unpredictable?

17
00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:31,250
Let's just say you should be careful.

18
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:33,669
Oh, cool!

19
00:00:33,737 --> 00:00:35,287
- Jamie!
- I didn't mean to!

20
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:37,223
Look what you did! Go to your room!

21
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,325
Even though she doesn't
show it all the time,

22
00:00:39,392 --> 00:00:43,596
deep down inside, your mom is still
very sad that your grandma died.

23
00:00:43,595 --> 00:00:45,116
Mom's gonna be okay, right?

24
00:00:53,024 --> 00:00:58,544
Someone once said that death is
not the greatest loss in life.

25
00:00:58,612 --> 00:01:02,698
The greatest loss is what dies
inside of us while we live.

26
00:01:02,783 --> 00:01:07,953
I could tell you who said it,
but who the hell really cares?

27
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,616
Mama?

28
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:17,761
Mama?

29
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:19,296
Mama?

30
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:22,750
I made my own breakfast
and cleaned everything up.

31
00:01:24,302 --> 00:01:27,187
What do you want, a gold star?

32
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:14,337
I mean, obviously, the
closing title song goes here,

33
00:03:14,337 --> 00:03:18,248
and the credits, and
it's all temp track sound,

34
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:19,883
but...

35
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:21,087
Is it okay?

36
00:03:21,087 --> 00:03:22,671
It's so good.

37
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,173
I loved the scenes
with them on the balcony

38
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:29,177
and the way he looked at
her when she slept and...

39
00:03:29,228 --> 00:03:30,696
It's really good!

40
00:03:30,763 --> 00:03:34,466
Alex and Josh actually
have amazing chemistry.

41
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:36,985
Seriously, with the douchey
puka shells and the sunglasses?

42
00:03:37,053 --> 00:03:40,272
Seriously, with the annoying voice and
the worse than annoying rest of you?

43
00:03:40,356 --> 00:03:42,524
Well, our next guests are
not only starring together

44
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:44,893
in a new independent
film, they're also starring

45
00:03:44,944 --> 00:03:47,813
together online as you may have heard...

46
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,717
I can't believe I have to pretend
to be with you... you... you...

47
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:53,001
You hear that?

48
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:55,470
That's the echo coming from your crotch.

49
00:03:55,538 --> 00:03:58,090
Oh, great. Add a nice batch
of ass breath to the mix.

50
00:03:58,174 --> 00:04:00,926
Please welcome actors
and real-life lovebirds,

51
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,295
Josh Avery and Alex DuprÃ©.

52
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:05,864
Dick.

53
00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:06,765
Whore.

54
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,469
Just a little ass breath for my baby.

55
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:18,427
It all just seems so fake...

56
00:04:18,494 --> 00:04:22,514
this idea that good things
happen to good people

57
00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:24,800
and there's magic in the world

58
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:27,936
and the meek and the
righteous will inherit it.

59
00:04:27,987 --> 00:04:30,322
There's too many good people who suffer

60
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,773
for something like that to be true.

61
00:04:31,824 --> 00:04:35,110
There are too many prayers
that get unanswered.

62
00:04:37,046 --> 00:04:41,883
Every day we ignore how
completely broken this world is,

63
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:45,087
and we tell ourselves
it's all gonna be okay.

64
00:04:45,138 --> 00:04:46,988
"You're gonna be okay."

65
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:51,292
But it's not okay.

66
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:54,546
And once you know that...

67
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:59,017
there's no going back.

68
00:05:00,737 --> 00:05:03,304
There's no magic in the world.

69
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,775
Least, not today there isn't.

70
00:05:32,151 --> 00:05:33,768
You've only been going two weeks,

71
00:05:33,853 --> 00:05:35,437
and you're already skipping sessions?

72
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:40,992
I don't blame you. It's a nice day.

73
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,862
Who'd want to waste an hour
in a therapist's office?

74
00:05:43,913 --> 00:05:46,114
It's 50 minutes, actually.

75
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,416
Somehow their hour
works out to 50 minutes.

76
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:52,287
If I told you that a half-hour was
20 minutes, you'd call me crazy.

77
00:05:52,371 --> 00:05:53,889
We're all crazy, Hales.

78
00:05:53,956 --> 00:05:56,758
Some of us just hide
it better than others.

79
00:05:56,826 --> 00:06:00,212
How'd you like to spend
the day, just you and me?

80
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,796
Quinn's watching Jamie.

81
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:03,315
Let's go for a drive.

82
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:05,183
Whatever.

83
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:07,435
You say the sweetest
things to me, Haley James.

84
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:15,076
There's my man!

85
00:06:15,144 --> 00:06:17,095
Hi, Aunt Quinn.

86
00:06:17,146 --> 00:06:18,513
Oh, come on, now.

87
00:06:18,581 --> 00:06:22,033
Don't make me find a cake and
stuff your face in it again.

88
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:23,818
I'm just worried about mom.

89
00:06:23,903 --> 00:06:26,071
I know.

90
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:27,822
But, hey, she's gonna be okay.

91
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,274
I promise.

92
00:06:29,325 --> 00:06:31,409
I hope so.

93
00:06:31,477 --> 00:06:33,962
I miss her... the way she used to be.

94
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,998
Me too.

95
00:06:41,387 --> 00:06:43,405
What's that movie?

96
00:06:43,472 --> 00:06:45,056
"The Goonies"!

97
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:46,458
Ever seen it?

98
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:47,976
- No.
- What?!

99
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,462
This was like my favorite
movie when I was your age.

100
00:06:51,514 --> 00:06:53,548
You, uh, you want to watch it with me?

101
00:06:53,616 --> 00:06:55,050
Sure. Can Chester watch, too?

102
00:06:55,117 --> 00:06:56,151
Yeah!

103
00:06:56,235 --> 00:06:57,969
It's totally bunny approved.

104
00:06:58,037 --> 00:06:59,020
Come on.

105
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:04,109
You ready?

106
00:07:04,109 --> 00:07:06,100
Yeah.

107
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:12,084
Maybe the movie sucks.

108
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:13,952
- Julian...
- No, I'm serious.

109
00:07:14,003 --> 00:07:16,204
Why did I ever get involved with
film-making in the first place?

110
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:17,989
Because you watched "The Thin Red Line"

111
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,541
with your father when you were a boy,

112
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,043
and it was the best day you ever had.

113
00:07:22,128 --> 00:07:23,795
You don't know me, Brooke Davis.

114
00:07:23,846 --> 00:07:25,513
Oh, I think I do, Julian Baker.

115
00:07:25,631 --> 00:07:27,048
And you know what else I know?

116
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:28,717
You'll get in.

117
00:07:28,801 --> 00:07:30,201
It's a big deal.

118
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:32,420
The Wasatch Valley Film
Festival is a first look for...

119
00:07:32,488 --> 00:07:33,888
A first look for a ton
of prestigious films.

120
00:07:33,956 --> 00:07:34,856
I know.

121
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:36,524
Today is the deadline.

122
00:07:36,609 --> 00:07:38,810
You gave them your cell,
my cell, and Paul's cell,

123
00:07:38,861 --> 00:07:41,146
and if you don't get in,
you're taking me to Cabo.

124
00:07:41,197 --> 00:07:43,398
Wait, when did I say the Cabo part?

125
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:45,183
You didn't, I just did.

126
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:48,370
I had to send them a rough cut.

127
00:07:48,437 --> 00:07:49,788
Maybe they hated it.

128
00:07:49,855 --> 00:07:53,425
Maybe they loved it, and they'll
tell you that when you get in.

129
00:07:53,492 --> 00:07:56,645
Maybe I love you, and
I'll love you forever.

130
00:07:59,832 --> 00:08:00,966
What's your day like?

131
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:02,917
Well, I have to go to the store

132
00:08:03,002 --> 00:08:06,471
and deal with my mother and
Alexander and that madness.

133
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:07,922
I have to fix the toe
that you are massacring.

134
00:08:11,978 --> 00:08:15,930
And then I'm gonna go
spend some time with Haley.

135
00:08:16,015 --> 00:08:17,115
Sorry.

136
00:08:17,183 --> 00:08:18,433
How's Haley doing?

137
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:20,986
Not good.

138
00:08:21,053 --> 00:08:24,339
She's just sad and depressed and angry.

139
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:26,558
Well, send her my best, okay?

140
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,777
I will.

141
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:31,780
And send Julian my best and
tell him I love him, okay?

142
00:08:31,864 --> 00:08:33,448
I will.

143
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,335
It's a great film.

144
00:08:37,403 --> 00:08:39,070
They'll call.

145
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:40,238
You'll get in.

146
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:47,846
My first week in Tree Hill,

147
00:08:47,913 --> 00:08:50,682
I told Haley I was gonna close this place.

148
00:08:50,749 --> 00:08:52,917
Couldn't wait to get out of here.

149
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:54,402
And now I'm gonna miss it.

150
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,305
Why, after last night, you're
still not ready to marry me?

151
00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:01,443
Last night was amazing.

152
00:09:01,527 --> 00:09:02,811
Every night has been.

153
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:04,429
But, no...

154
00:09:04,497 --> 00:09:05,880
I still can't marry you.

155
00:09:05,948 --> 00:09:09,901
I need you to promise me something.

156
00:09:09,969 --> 00:09:13,655
Promise me that when I'm gone,
you'll still finish the record.

157
00:09:13,723 --> 00:09:15,724
I will.

158
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,275
For you.

159
00:09:17,326 --> 00:09:19,244
No. For you.

160
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:20,345
For us.

161
00:09:21,997 --> 00:09:24,332
But we are not that far off.

162
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,485
We might just finish this thing
by the time you have to leave.

163
00:09:27,553 --> 00:09:29,387
No. We won't.

164
00:09:31,424 --> 00:09:33,675
Because I leave tonight.

165
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,627
What?

166
00:09:35,694 --> 00:09:37,095
Why didn't you tell me?

167
00:09:37,163 --> 00:09:38,629
Because last night was amazing.

168
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,935
But now I have to go...

169
00:09:43,986 --> 00:09:45,303
tonight.

170
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,589
Relationships suck.

171
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,591
Okay, but I'm supposed to be the
one with relationship problems,

172
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:03,976
and you are supposed to be

173
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,011
the "sweet but kind of rough
around the edges" bartender

174
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:07,396
who listens and offers sage advice.

175
00:10:07,463 --> 00:10:09,464
You don't have relationship problems.

176
00:10:09,516 --> 00:10:10,516
How would you know?

177
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:15,771
Right.

178
00:10:15,822 --> 00:10:17,690
Now I definitely need a drink.

179
00:10:17,774 --> 00:10:19,358
Shot of Tequila.

180
00:10:19,442 --> 00:10:20,492
But you have to drink it.

181
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,061
Perfect.

182
00:10:33,497 --> 00:10:34,343
Quinn?

183
00:10:34,991 --> 00:10:35,874
In here, honey.

184
00:10:38,728 --> 00:10:39,678
What are you doing here?

185
00:10:39,746 --> 00:10:42,231
What do you mean, baby?

186
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:43,515
Don't call me that.

187
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,090
All right, the song,
the grape Kool-Aid...

188
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,559
how do you know about
that? How do you know?

189
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,472
What do you mean, how do I know?

190
00:10:50,523 --> 00:10:52,858
Clay, it's me, honey. It's Sara.

191
00:10:52,926 --> 00:10:54,960
- Don't say that.
- Clay...

192
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:56,395
Sara's dead.

193
00:10:56,463 --> 00:10:58,113
Don't you remember when
we first heard this song?

194
00:10:58,181 --> 00:11:01,116
We flew to Austin for
that weekend in October

195
00:11:01,184 --> 00:11:03,402
- and stayed in that little house.
- Stop it.

196
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,653
The day we first met.

197
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:06,071
I said I'd rather streak on the quad,

198
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:07,823
and you said you picked the wrong school.

199
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:10,125
I don't know how you know these things,

200
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:13,045
but I do know that my wife is dead,

201
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:14,797
and she's not coming back.

202
00:11:14,864 --> 00:11:16,498
And neither are you. All right?

203
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:17,800
Do you understand me?

204
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:19,852
Don't ever come back here. Out.

205
00:11:22,105 --> 00:11:24,006
I'm here, Clay.

206
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:25,874
It's me.

207
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:28,043
We could be together again.

208
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:30,095
No. We can't be together.

209
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,097
And we won't be together, ever.

210
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:33,198
Now get out.

211
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:35,934
Go. Out.

212
00:11:48,152 --> 00:11:50,570
That movie...

213
00:11:50,638 --> 00:11:51,451
was so awesome.

214
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:52,522
I know.

215
00:11:52,522 --> 00:11:56,468
Wouldn't it be cool if there actually
was a secret treasure somewhere?

216
00:11:56,468 --> 00:11:59,587
Well, funny you should say that,

217
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:02,273
because a long time ago I found this...

218
00:12:02,341 --> 00:12:04,342
But I've never been able to figure it out.

219
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:05,760
Maybe you can help me.

220
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:09,163
Let's see.

221
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:11,549
"If the treasure you do seek,

222
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:14,051
no one tell and no word speak.

223
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:17,221
Commit no crime but go to court,

224
00:12:17,306 --> 00:12:20,308
not for law, instead for sport."

225
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,193
What does it mean?

226
00:12:22,277 --> 00:12:23,477
I don't know.

227
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:26,564
I mean, what kind of
court doesn't have lawyers?

228
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,867
A courtyard?

229
00:12:29,952 --> 00:12:31,953
No.

230
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,504
Ooh, a tennis court...

231
00:12:33,572 --> 00:12:37,408
"Not for law, instead for sport."

232
00:12:38,877 --> 00:12:41,279
Court... for sport.

233
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,080
The Rivercourt!

234
00:12:43,165 --> 00:12:44,865
Yes!

235
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:47,301
Ah, you are such a genius!

236
00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:49,654
- Maybe the next clue is there.
- Yeah.

237
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:51,422
- Oh, man. I gotta get some stuff.
- Okay.

238
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,441
A shovel... a flashlight...

239
00:12:53,508 --> 00:12:55,092
We're totally going on a treasure hunt!

240
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:04,118
Well, this isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

241
00:13:04,186 --> 00:13:06,020
You feel like talking?

242
00:13:06,088 --> 00:13:08,055
Why, is that what the doctors told you?

243
00:13:08,106 --> 00:13:09,523
To try and get me to talk?

244
00:13:09,575 --> 00:13:12,193
I just thought you
might want to talk to me.

245
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:16,430
Tell me about something you still love...

246
00:13:16,498 --> 00:13:18,950
Or about something you hate... anything.

247
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,588
I hate traffic.

248
00:13:30,462 --> 00:13:33,464
You know what? You're right.

249
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:35,416
It is a perfect day for a walk.

250
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:44,942
Victoria? Alexander? Millicent?

251
00:13:48,096 --> 00:13:50,548
Really?!

252
00:13:50,616 --> 00:13:54,085
Please tell me Millicent
is not in there, too.

253
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:56,103
Nope. She's in New York.

254
00:13:56,154 --> 00:13:57,538
And unfortunately, honey,

255
00:13:57,605 --> 00:14:00,441
I think I need to start thinking
about going back, as well.

256
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:01,809
Why?

257
00:14:01,877 --> 00:14:03,911
Well, because the men's line is finished,

258
00:14:03,962 --> 00:14:07,665
and, uh, the offices to our
multimillion-dollar company are in New York.

259
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:09,133
Well, what about your cub?

260
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:10,985
I want to run Clothes For Bros.

261
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:12,653
I designed it, and...

262
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:15,890
We designed it, and... and no
one can sell it better than me.

263
00:14:15,957 --> 00:14:17,842
You want to run Clothes For Bros.

264
00:14:17,926 --> 00:14:19,293
That's right.

265
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:21,312
And, um...

266
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:23,014
I want to run it from New York.

267
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:25,333
With Victoria.

268
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:31,656
It's all a lie.

269
00:14:31,723 --> 00:14:34,275
Me and Josh, our relationship.

270
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:37,094
See, he kind of made this sex tape of us,

271
00:14:37,162 --> 00:14:38,663
and I thought if we were together,

272
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:40,014
maybe it wouldn't look so bad.

273
00:14:40,082 --> 00:14:41,949
Yeah, I've seen it.

274
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:43,367
You're prettier in person.

275
00:14:45,003 --> 00:14:47,505
Well, I just... I want
someone stable, you know?

276
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:52,293
Someone who's normal and reliable
and has, like, a regular job.

277
00:14:52,344 --> 00:14:53,511
Like a bartender?

278
00:14:54,713 --> 00:14:56,597
You're flirty like me. I like that.

279
00:14:56,664 --> 00:14:58,549
But you have a girlfriend.

280
00:14:58,617 --> 00:15:01,268
A famous, gorgeous, rock-star girlfriend.

281
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:02,937
Had...

282
00:15:03,004 --> 00:15:04,805
as in not anymore.

283
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:07,358
Cheers.

284
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,520
Oh, I was thinking about
the finality of it all.

285
00:15:19,588 --> 00:15:22,907
How somebody can leave your
world in the blink of an eye

286
00:15:22,991 --> 00:15:25,493
and be gone forever.

287
00:15:25,544 --> 00:15:28,512
It's...

288
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,365
it's too enormous to think about.

289
00:15:32,918 --> 00:15:34,785
It's too hard.

290
00:15:36,371 --> 00:15:37,888
And then we're just
supposed to go on, right?

291
00:15:37,973 --> 00:15:39,607
Like, just...

292
00:15:39,674 --> 00:15:41,175
Deal with it.

293
00:15:41,226 --> 00:15:43,561
I mean, really you're supposed to be sad

294
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:45,262
for about as long as the flowers last,

295
00:15:45,347 --> 00:15:47,748
and then, oh, time to
go back to telling jokes

296
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:50,735
and reminiscing about the old days.

297
00:15:52,766 --> 00:15:54,238
I don't have any jokes to tell.

298
00:15:58,059 --> 00:15:59,660
As a matter of fact,

299
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:03,464
I hope I never hear another
joke as long as I live.

300
00:16:03,532 --> 00:16:06,500
And the old days are just... that.

301
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:09,003
They're old days that are...

302
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,005
gone.

303
00:16:11,072 --> 00:16:12,840
Check it out.

304
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:15,209
"You can just score your
touchdowns, Mr. big shot,

305
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,962
because math don't care and neither do I."

306
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:20,714
It's not gonna change anything, Nathan.

307
00:16:20,766 --> 00:16:23,868
Whatever prize you find in
that box is not gonna fix me.

308
00:16:23,935 --> 00:16:25,352
Why not?

309
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,887
It fixed me.

310
00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:57,241
What's going on?

311
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,826
Just doing laundry.

312
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,077
Car got towed.

313
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,429
Car got towed?

314
00:17:01,496 --> 00:17:04,081
Yeah, it's a long story. I got it back.

315
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:05,783
Check it out.

316
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:09,403
These are my son's pants.

317
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:11,238
The guy sees the world from down here.

318
00:17:11,306 --> 00:17:12,873
I haven't had the heart to tell him

319
00:17:12,924 --> 00:17:14,759
that the NBA's probably not in his future.

320
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:18,295
Oh, I don't know, dude.
Spud Webb, Muggsy Bogues.

321
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,298
I love it when you talk
diminutive NBA point guards.

322
00:17:21,383 --> 00:17:23,917
So has Julian heard about Wasatch yet?

323
00:17:23,969 --> 00:17:26,854
No. And how do you know about that?

324
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,088
I ran into him yesterday.

325
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,440
That's all he could talk about.

326
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:30,558
Well, he hasn't heard,

327
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:33,160
but I did see a rough cut of
the movie and it's really good.

328
00:17:33,228 --> 00:17:34,412
Nice.

329
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:35,312
How's Haley?

330
00:17:36,715 --> 00:17:39,266
Oh, she's pretty much
the same as last week.

331
00:17:39,317 --> 00:17:42,436
The doctors say that depression
is different for everybody,

332
00:17:42,487 --> 00:17:46,240
but... one day she might
just... feel better.

333
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:48,292
They just don't know
when that day will be.

334
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,027
Well, let's hope that day's today.

335
00:17:50,095 --> 00:17:51,679
Yeah.

336
00:17:51,747 --> 00:17:53,380
How are you and Jamie?

337
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:54,632
I'm doing okay.

338
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,567
I mean, I know she's not herself,

339
00:17:56,635 --> 00:17:59,403
but Jamie's struggling with it.

340
00:17:59,471 --> 00:18:02,506
He doesn't understand why his
mom is not his mom anymore.

341
00:18:02,591 --> 00:18:05,676
His whole life, she's been
nothing but consistent and sweet.

342
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:07,628
And he can't be too thrilled about his dad

343
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,013
turning all of his socks pink.

344
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:13,267
You got to separate the
colors from the whites, buddy.

345
00:18:13,318 --> 00:18:14,819
Yeah.

346
00:18:14,903 --> 00:18:16,937
Other than that, I'm proud of you.

347
00:18:16,988 --> 00:18:19,123
You're exactly what Haley needs right now.

348
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:22,426
Well, she's always been everything to us.

349
00:18:22,494 --> 00:18:25,579
Now it's time for us to be her everything.

350
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,416
In sickness and in health, right?

351
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:30,785
For better or worse.

352
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:32,953
For better or for worse,

353
00:18:33,021 --> 00:18:34,622
to have and to hold,

354
00:18:34,673 --> 00:18:37,074
to love and to cherish,

355
00:18:37,142 --> 00:18:39,810
until death do you part?

356
00:18:39,878 --> 00:18:41,462
I do.

357
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,202
Where do you think we should look?

358
00:18:51,203 --> 00:18:52,420
I don't know.

359
00:18:52,504 --> 00:18:54,338
You check the bleachers,
I'll look over here.

360
00:18:54,406 --> 00:18:55,256
Okay!

361
00:18:58,544 --> 00:18:59,927
You find anything yet?

362
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:01,512
Not yet! You?

363
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,964
No...

364
00:19:03,031 --> 00:19:04,849
Wait! Over here!

365
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:05,850
I found another one!

366
00:19:10,022 --> 00:19:12,106
"Another clue is waiting near.

367
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,525
First you must get past the fear.

368
00:19:14,593 --> 00:19:16,677
Not on a hill or up a mountain,

369
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:18,312
make a wish into the... "

370
00:19:18,397 --> 00:19:19,814
the what?

371
00:19:19,882 --> 00:19:21,315
It doesn't say.

372
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,118
"Not on a hill or up a mountain,

373
00:19:24,202 --> 00:19:27,188
make a wish into the... "

374
00:19:27,256 --> 00:19:29,523
Fountain! People make
wishes in the fountain!

375
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:30,658
Yes!

376
00:19:30,726 --> 00:19:32,076
But which one?

377
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:34,729
"First you must get past the fear... "

378
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:36,130
Fear."

379
00:19:36,214 --> 00:19:38,015
The river! It's the cape fear river!

380
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:41,161
The fountain!

381
00:19:41,253 --> 00:19:43,487
Come on, Aunt Quinn! Hurry!

382
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,009
Hey. Tell me you're here to celebrate.

383
00:19:48,093 --> 00:19:49,226
Nope.

384
00:19:49,294 --> 00:19:50,628
At this point,

385
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:53,014
more people are gonna see
your sex tape than this movie.

386
00:19:53,098 --> 00:19:54,382
First of all, don't be mean.

387
00:19:54,449 --> 00:19:56,050
Second of all, shouldn't you be editing?

388
00:19:56,118 --> 00:19:57,301
I'm taking a break.

389
00:19:57,352 --> 00:19:58,903
No, you're pouting, is what you're doing.

390
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,488
Just like good old chase here.

391
00:20:00,572 --> 00:20:01,522
What are you pouting about?

392
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:02,640
And I'll take a beer.

393
00:20:02,691 --> 00:20:03,858
I've heard about your mixed drinks.

394
00:20:03,942 --> 00:20:05,576
First of all, don't be mean.

395
00:20:05,644 --> 00:20:07,411
Second, I'm pouting because of this.

396
00:20:09,414 --> 00:20:10,581
"I don't think it's fair to you

397
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:12,283
that I'm on the road most of the year

398
00:20:12,351 --> 00:20:14,151
and that my schedule
changes all the time.

399
00:20:14,202 --> 00:20:15,503
It's not fair to either of us.

400
00:20:15,587 --> 00:20:17,371
I wish things were
different, but they aren't.

401
00:20:17,456 --> 00:20:18,973
I'm sorry."

402
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,108
Mia broke up with you by text message?

403
00:20:21,176 --> 00:20:24,595
Mia broke up with me over
a series of text messages.

404
00:20:24,663 --> 00:20:25,630
Texting's evil, man.

405
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:28,916
I got this theory that if the
phone was invented after texting,

406
00:20:28,984 --> 00:20:30,851
we'd all be like, "this is amazing!

407
00:20:30,936 --> 00:20:32,670
You can actually hear their voice!"

408
00:20:32,738 --> 00:20:33,854
And nobody would text.

409
00:20:33,939 --> 00:20:35,806
Yeah, it's not so much the texting part,

410
00:20:35,857 --> 00:20:37,642
but the break-up part that bothers me.

411
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:39,009
I'm sorry.

412
00:20:39,061 --> 00:20:40,695
That's too bad. Mia's a rock star.

413
00:20:42,047 --> 00:20:43,397
Literally.

414
00:20:43,482 --> 00:20:44,932
A really fine rock star.

415
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,651
I'd totally sleep with her.

416
00:20:46,702 --> 00:20:48,619
Can you guys just drink
your drinks and go?

417
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:50,137
I'm sorry.

418
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:52,123
It's hard to date someone in
the entertainment industry.

419
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,325
I mean, we're mostly gypsies, you know?

420
00:20:54,376 --> 00:20:56,360
We're never home. We're all needy as hell.

421
00:20:56,428 --> 00:20:58,112
Where is she right now, anyway?

422
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,313
I don't even know.

423
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:00,865
Paris... Spain.

424
00:21:00,932 --> 00:21:02,383
Tric.

425
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,230
Hi.

426
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,579
- Do you see it?
- Not yet.

427
00:21:17,794 --> 00:21:19,528
Maybe this is the treasure.

428
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:22,081
That's other people's wishes! Put it back!

429
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:23,182
Sorry.

430
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,085
Look! There!

431
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:28,037
Ah, yes!

432
00:21:28,105 --> 00:21:29,789
Oh, man, we're gonna get soaked!

433
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:31,657
No, you're gonna get soaked.

434
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,823
Maybe not.

435
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,285
Nice.

436
00:21:40,684 --> 00:21:42,518
You are a genius.

437
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:51,818
- You ready?
- Yeah.

438
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:02,902
Hey! Get out of that fountain!

439
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:05,771
Hurry! Come on!

440
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:08,323
I got it! It's a clue!

441
00:22:08,408 --> 00:22:10,826
Come on!

442
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,322
I have to tell myself to just be happy,

443
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:22,949
but... I don't feel happy.

444
00:22:22,949 --> 00:22:24,950
And when I try to change it,

445
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:28,304
when I try to remember
what being happy felt like,

446
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:30,473
I... can't.

447
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,558
I...

448
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:35,761
Don't feel joy, I don't feel inspired.

449
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:38,047
I feel numb.

450
00:22:42,886 --> 00:22:46,105
- Hi.
- Hi, darling.

451
00:22:47,674 --> 00:22:49,007
Hello, Haley.

452
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:50,175
The last time I saw you,

453
00:22:50,227 --> 00:22:51,677
you were ruining my sister's exhibit.

454
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,229
Oh, look at you go.

455
00:22:53,313 --> 00:22:55,364
But you know you're talking
to the queen of mean, sister.

456
00:22:55,448 --> 00:22:56,899
So you're gonna have
to do better than that.

457
00:22:56,983 --> 00:22:58,134
Mom.

458
00:22:58,201 --> 00:22:59,468
I'm gonna be outside.

459
00:22:59,536 --> 00:23:00,786
Haley.

460
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:02,204
Haley, listen to me.

461
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:04,290
I know you're in a great
deal of pain right now,

462
00:23:04,357 --> 00:23:05,791
but I also know that you're aware

463
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:07,126
of the choices you're making.

464
00:23:07,193 --> 00:23:08,694
So I want you to listen to me,

465
00:23:08,745 --> 00:23:11,580
and then you can say something snarky
or dismissive and be on your way.

466
00:23:11,665 --> 00:23:13,315
But, please, sit. Please.

467
00:23:13,383 --> 00:23:15,417
Come on.

468
00:23:15,502 --> 00:23:16,535
Please.

469
00:23:18,588 --> 00:23:20,706
Your mother was proud of you.

470
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,141
And it would break her heart

471
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:26,328
to know that her beautiful,
kind, inspiring daughter

472
00:23:26,396 --> 00:23:27,813
was suffering like this.

473
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:30,266
I know that because I'm a mother.

474
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,867
And so are you.

475
00:23:31,935 --> 00:23:35,888
Now, our lives are difficult,

476
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:39,191
and our loss unbearable sometimes.

477
00:23:39,242 --> 00:23:41,026
So grieve...

478
00:23:41,077 --> 00:23:42,561
and struggle,

479
00:23:42,612 --> 00:23:44,446
and you find your way
back on your own terms

480
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:45,664
and in your own way.

481
00:23:45,732 --> 00:23:47,616
But remember this...

482
00:23:47,684 --> 00:23:50,119
your mother would want you
to be vibrant and inspiring

483
00:23:50,187 --> 00:23:51,570
in the face of her losing her.

484
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:54,573
She'd want you to fight your
pain with all you've got.

485
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:58,844
Because that's the
daughter that she raised.

486
00:23:58,912 --> 00:24:01,247
That's the daughter that she loved.

487
00:24:08,274 --> 00:24:10,843
"Every castle has a moat,

488
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,762
every pirate has a boat.

489
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,582
Find the clue near tugboats red,

490
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:19,852
in the ship that's sleeping dead."

491
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,637
"Sleeping dead."

492
00:24:24,774 --> 00:24:27,676
I'd say that boat is sleeping dead.

493
00:24:27,743 --> 00:24:29,128
Oh, yeah.

494
00:24:30,613 --> 00:24:31,913
Be careful!

495
00:24:31,965 --> 00:24:33,182
Goof.

496
00:24:39,422 --> 00:24:41,407
When'd you get back?

497
00:24:41,474 --> 00:24:42,624
About an hour ago.

498
00:24:42,692 --> 00:24:46,261
Miranda needs help running the
label while Haley's not feeling well.

499
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:48,730
And I wouldn't have a career
if it weren't for Red Bedroom,

500
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:51,183
so I told them I wanted to help out.

501
00:24:51,251 --> 00:24:53,869
I'm sure they appreciate it.

502
00:24:53,937 --> 00:24:56,605
So, you'll be around here for a while.

503
00:24:56,656 --> 00:24:59,475
I think so. Yeah.

504
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:01,827
That's good.

505
00:25:01,911 --> 00:25:04,797
You got to delete those texts.

506
00:25:04,881 --> 00:25:06,632
Yeah. I did.

507
00:25:06,716 --> 00:25:07,633
No, you didn't.

508
00:25:07,717 --> 00:25:08,667
How do you know?

509
00:25:08,735 --> 00:25:10,085
Because I know you.

510
00:25:10,153 --> 00:25:12,604
You've been sitting around
reading the same words

511
00:25:12,672 --> 00:25:15,174
over and over, and it's not good for you.

512
00:25:15,258 --> 00:25:16,809
I don't know how it happened,

513
00:25:16,893 --> 00:25:18,127
so I keep reading what we said...

514
00:25:18,194 --> 00:25:20,462
well, what we wrote...

515
00:25:20,513 --> 00:25:22,297
Hoping that when I get to the end,

516
00:25:22,365 --> 00:25:24,983
maybe the ending will be different. But...

517
00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:26,801
It's always the same.

518
00:25:26,853 --> 00:25:30,322
Does it help if I say I care
about you and I always will?

519
00:25:30,406 --> 00:25:33,392
Nope.

520
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,161
It just reminds me how beautiful you are.

521
00:25:36,229 --> 00:25:38,697
And that just kind of makes it worse.

522
00:25:44,225 --> 00:25:46,511
It'll be okay.

523
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,315
By the way, who's
running the bar right now?

524
00:25:52,345 --> 00:25:55,731
I could totally get used
to this bartending thing.

525
00:25:56,657 --> 00:25:57,624
Check it out.

526
00:26:01,584 --> 00:26:04,269
Nice. Nice.

527
00:26:05,005 --> 00:26:07,841
So, what's the big deal about
this film festival anyway?

528
00:26:07,892 --> 00:26:09,559
It'll help us sell the film.

529
00:26:09,643 --> 00:26:11,261
Which you're gonna do because it's good,

530
00:26:11,345 --> 00:26:13,146
but let's play "worst case scenario."

531
00:26:13,213 --> 00:26:16,349
What happens if the film
doesn't sell? Then what?

532
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,268
I get some rope and a ladder.

533
00:26:18,352 --> 00:26:19,986
Okay, normally not funny,

534
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:22,772
but considering you're talking to a person

535
00:26:22,857 --> 00:26:25,692
who actually attempted
suicide, really not funny.

536
00:26:25,743 --> 00:26:27,444
Right. Sorry.

537
00:26:27,528 --> 00:26:32,332
If the film doesn't sell, then all
that work will amount to nothing.

538
00:26:32,332 --> 00:26:33,616
Nothing.

539
00:26:33,617 --> 00:26:35,618
You mean like "working with your father,

540
00:26:35,686 --> 00:26:39,572
getting Brooke back, and
saving my life" nothing?

541
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,144
Whatever happens, this movie
will always be the greatest thing

542
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:45,545
that ever happened to me.

543
00:26:45,596 --> 00:26:47,130
It saved my life.

544
00:26:47,198 --> 00:26:49,132
You saved my life.

545
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:55,638
And I got to watch a truly amazing
director direct his first film.

546
00:26:55,706 --> 00:26:58,408
I'd say that amounts to a
little bit more than nothing.

547
00:26:59,794 --> 00:27:01,478
Wow.

548
00:27:01,562 --> 00:27:04,330
You know what? You're absolutely right.

549
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:05,315
Thank you, Alex.

550
00:27:07,434 --> 00:27:11,254
All right. I got to go work on our movie.

551
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,157
I found it!

552
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:15,658
What?!

553
00:27:15,726 --> 00:27:17,460
It's in this bottle.

554
00:27:17,545 --> 00:27:19,045
Nice work, buddy!

555
00:27:19,112 --> 00:27:20,764
Stand back while I break it.

556
00:27:20,831 --> 00:27:22,132
Watch your eyes.

557
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:23,133
Okay.

558
00:27:26,286 --> 00:27:27,654
Okay, let me get it. Here.

559
00:27:30,508 --> 00:27:33,143
"In your hands this final clue,

560
00:27:33,227 --> 00:27:34,627
if you know just what to do.

561
00:27:34,678 --> 00:27:36,796
Place it with the other three,

562
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:39,465
and the treasure you will see."

563
00:27:40,684 --> 00:27:41,818
I don't get it.

564
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,739
Well, remember the design on the back?

565
00:27:48,242 --> 00:27:50,243
- It's a map!
- Mm-hmm.

566
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:51,477
There's the Rivercourt,

567
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:53,079
the fountain, and the sleeping boat.

568
00:27:59,503 --> 00:28:01,371
I know where the treasure is. Come on!

569
00:28:17,137 --> 00:28:18,805
Hello?

570
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,874
Do you know this woman?

571
00:28:39,243 --> 00:28:41,361
Yeah, she's my wife.

572
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,559
- What's this?
- I'm going with you.

573
00:28:59,227 --> 00:29:01,629
- Michael...
- I know it's only been a few weeks.

574
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:03,230
I feel like you could love me,

575
00:29:03,298 --> 00:29:04,832
and I know that I could love you.

576
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,100
Michael, listen to me.

577
00:29:06,168 --> 00:29:07,635
You have a record to finish,

578
00:29:07,702 --> 00:29:09,820
and I have a life to
live, and that's okay.

579
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:11,172
I have to leave, and you have to stay.

580
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:12,573
You're wrong.

581
00:29:12,657 --> 00:29:14,525
You have to go. I don't have to stay.

582
00:29:14,576 --> 00:29:15,993
I want to go with you.

583
00:29:16,044 --> 00:29:18,429
But you don't understand!
I don't want you to come!

584
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,467
I'm sorry, Grubbs.

585
00:29:25,654 --> 00:29:27,054
Goodbye.

586
00:29:32,561 --> 00:29:35,479
It's got to be around here somewhere.

587
00:29:35,547 --> 00:29:37,348
I don't know, Jame.

588
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:40,100
Maybe we're in the wrong spot.

589
00:29:40,185 --> 00:29:41,218
Look!

590
00:29:42,487 --> 00:29:43,370
Treasure!

591
00:29:45,824 --> 00:29:47,408
Yes!

592
00:29:47,492 --> 00:29:48,609
Come on.

593
00:30:13,969 --> 00:30:16,136
You told me to never come back.

594
00:30:16,204 --> 00:30:18,272
I know I did.

595
00:30:18,356 --> 00:30:19,923
But I was wrong.

596
00:30:19,975 --> 00:30:23,110
I'm... I'm just gonna be here, okay?

597
00:30:23,178 --> 00:30:25,029
I'll jump. I mean it.

598
00:30:25,096 --> 00:30:27,781
No, you won't.

599
00:30:27,866 --> 00:30:30,150
You wouldn't have jumped
off that bridge in college

600
00:30:30,235 --> 00:30:31,952
if I hadn't been there to hold your hand.

601
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,171
You said you didn't believe me.

602
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:36,824
I was just afraid of loving you again.

603
00:30:36,892 --> 00:30:41,378
The way that I used to and
the way that I still do.

604
00:30:41,446 --> 00:30:44,999
Tell me you love me, Clay.

605
00:30:45,066 --> 00:30:49,587
Tell me you love me
and that you believe me.

606
00:30:49,654 --> 00:30:51,722
Please.

607
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:53,474
Or I'll jump.

608
00:30:53,558 --> 00:30:54,508
Don't. Okay?

609
00:30:56,111 --> 00:30:57,895
Sara, don't leave me again.

610
00:31:00,115 --> 00:31:02,366
I love you.

611
00:31:04,753 --> 00:31:06,520
Just take my hand...

612
00:31:06,605 --> 00:31:08,572
and we can be together.

613
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,691
Please?

614
00:31:10,775 --> 00:31:13,360
On the count of two?

615
00:31:13,428 --> 00:31:15,396
One...

616
00:31:15,463 --> 00:31:16,730
two.

617
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:19,767
It's okay. You're okay. See?

618
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:22,002
I finally have you back.

619
00:31:23,905 --> 00:31:26,624
No! Stop it! Clay!

620
00:31:26,675 --> 00:31:28,259
It's okay, Katie. They're gonna help you.

621
00:31:28,326 --> 00:31:30,811
Wait. You called me Katie.

622
00:31:30,879 --> 00:31:33,764
But I'm Sara! You said you loved me!

623
00:31:33,831 --> 00:31:36,884
No, Katie. I love Quinn.

624
00:31:36,968 --> 00:31:38,535
Sara's gone.

625
00:31:45,627 --> 00:31:46,627
Yes!

626
00:31:46,695 --> 00:31:47,945
Oh, yeah!

627
00:31:48,012 --> 00:31:49,029
We found it!

628
00:31:49,097 --> 00:31:50,314
No, you found it.

629
00:31:50,382 --> 00:31:51,582
It's all yours.

630
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,150
Really?

631
00:31:53,201 --> 00:31:54,151
Open it up.

632
00:31:54,202 --> 00:31:56,036
Oh, I wish mom was here.

633
00:31:56,121 --> 00:31:57,087
Me too.

634
00:31:57,155 --> 00:31:58,906
Oh.

635
00:31:59,024 --> 00:31:59,740
Treasure!

636
00:32:00,825 --> 00:32:02,526
Oh, it's so cool!

637
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:05,829
Look at all those
dimes. Oh, this is crazy!

638
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,998
- Sweet!
- Cool.

639
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:09,566
Look at this one.

640
00:32:09,634 --> 00:32:11,251
Yeah!

641
00:32:14,205 --> 00:32:15,255
I don't think we should keep it.

642
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,757
Why not?

643
00:32:16,825 --> 00:32:18,809
Well

644
00:32:18,876 --> 00:32:20,561
I was thinking...

645
00:32:20,629 --> 00:32:23,380
The Goonies wanted to save their homes.

646
00:32:23,431 --> 00:32:25,949
That's why they needed the treasure.

647
00:32:26,017 --> 00:32:28,902
So, maybe someone needs
this more than I do.

648
00:32:28,987 --> 00:32:30,704
Having a home is important.

649
00:32:30,772 --> 00:32:33,490
I think that's wonderful.

650
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:37,645
But are you sure there's not
anything you want to keep?

651
00:32:37,712 --> 00:32:41,415
Um... maybe just one thing.

652
00:32:49,407 --> 00:32:50,958
I just want mama to be okay.

653
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:52,076
That's all I want.

654
00:32:52,143 --> 00:32:54,144
Me too.

655
00:32:54,212 --> 00:32:56,547
Come on, let's get this buried again.

656
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,211
It's nice, isn't it?

657
00:33:15,211 --> 00:33:18,252
I remember when you found
out I was opening this store.

658
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:19,820
You were not very happy.

659
00:33:19,904 --> 00:33:21,572
And you like it here.

660
00:33:21,623 --> 00:33:24,375
In Tree Hill? Please.

661
00:33:24,442 --> 00:33:27,911
I like being near my daughter.

662
00:33:27,962 --> 00:33:29,747
Yeah, if that's your story.

663
00:33:29,798 --> 00:33:31,248
So, be honest with me.

664
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:34,117
Should I let Alexander
run Clothes For Bros?

665
00:33:34,169 --> 00:33:37,237
No, you should let Millicent
run Clothes For Bros.

666
00:33:37,305 --> 00:33:39,973
Alexander's a designer.
He should be designing.

667
00:33:40,058 --> 00:33:41,759
Have you told him that?

668
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,812
I thought I'd tell him
in the next few days.

669
00:33:44,896 --> 00:33:46,563
Why spoil the next few nights?

670
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:52,519
Maybe you're afraid of committing to him.

671
00:33:52,604 --> 00:33:56,023
Of having him in New York
and in your world every day.

672
00:33:56,107 --> 00:33:57,808
Of falling in love.

673
00:33:59,477 --> 00:34:02,529
He's a boy, Brooke. No
one's falling in love.

674
00:34:02,597 --> 00:34:04,114
He is.

675
00:34:06,918 --> 00:34:08,819
I'm gonna miss this.

676
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:12,823
The best part about this company
has been building it with you.

677
00:34:12,874 --> 00:34:15,542
Spending time with you.
I used to dream about it.

678
00:34:16,928 --> 00:34:18,595
Thank you, mom.

679
00:34:18,663 --> 00:34:20,497
Thank you.

680
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,886
My beautiful daughter.

681
00:34:32,286 --> 00:34:34,983
This mascara is defective!

682
00:34:35,396 --> 00:34:36,897
They're called tears, mother.

683
00:34:36,981 --> 00:34:39,516
You can feel them because
the botox is wearing off.

684
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:41,952
You're such a little bitch!

685
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:43,904
And I mean it in a good way.

686
00:34:43,988 --> 00:34:46,457
Alexander's a good guy...

687
00:34:46,524 --> 00:34:49,126
And he is a good designer,

688
00:34:49,194 --> 00:34:51,044
and the line wouldn't
be the same without him,

689
00:34:51,129 --> 00:34:52,429
so I'm gonna give him the job.

690
00:34:52,497 --> 00:34:54,832
He'll report to you, of course,

691
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:56,583
and Millicent will be the vice president.

692
00:34:56,668 --> 00:34:58,552
You're the boss.

693
00:35:00,054 --> 00:35:02,840
So you really think
he's... falling in love?

694
00:35:02,891 --> 00:35:04,141
I do.

695
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:06,593
That would be kind of nice.

696
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,806
I'm a...

697
00:35:13,601 --> 00:35:16,603
I'm so proud of you.

698
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,447
And I love you.

699
00:35:22,994 --> 00:35:24,561
And I love you, too.

700
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:30,784
See you soon. Okay.

701
00:36:05,436 --> 00:36:06,653
There you go.

702
00:36:06,738 --> 00:36:08,271
Thank you, Aunt Quinn.

703
00:36:08,323 --> 00:36:10,207
For what, handsome?

704
00:36:10,275 --> 00:36:11,375
For all of this.

705
00:36:11,442 --> 00:36:13,277
I know you did it all for me,

706
00:36:13,344 --> 00:36:15,896
and it was one of the
best days I ever had.

707
00:36:15,964 --> 00:36:17,664
Thank you. I love you.

708
00:36:17,749 --> 00:36:19,750
Mm, I love you, too.

709
00:36:20,952 --> 00:36:22,452
We all do.

710
00:36:22,503 --> 00:36:24,221
Okay, you ready?

711
00:36:46,527 --> 00:36:49,329
There's a journal that
my wife used to keep.

712
00:36:49,414 --> 00:36:51,198
It pretty much documents
our life together,

713
00:36:51,282 --> 00:36:52,833
and it's missing.

714
00:36:52,917 --> 00:36:54,701
I'd like to have it back.

715
00:37:13,504 --> 00:37:15,171
Hi.

716
00:37:15,223 --> 00:37:16,607
I'm Mia.

717
00:37:16,674 --> 00:37:18,875
I'm gonna be around for a
while helping to run the label.

718
00:37:20,278 --> 00:37:22,162
Miranda told me.

719
00:37:24,032 --> 00:37:27,167
Why don't we start by, um,
listening to your record?

720
00:37:27,235 --> 00:37:29,453
Sure.

721
00:37:30,855 --> 00:37:32,255
But I'm gonna need a second.

722
00:37:32,323 --> 00:37:35,409
I... just had my heart broken.

723
00:37:35,476 --> 00:37:37,744
Yeah, me too.

724
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:32,185
Jamie's asleep, and I think Haley is, too.

725
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,603
You okay?

726
00:38:34,772 --> 00:38:36,940
Your mom had a cellphone.

727
00:38:37,008 --> 00:38:38,442
Do you know where it is?

728
00:38:38,493 --> 00:38:41,094
Yeah, it's in a box of
stuff at the gallery. Why?

729
00:38:53,758 --> 00:38:55,592
You were out late.

730
00:38:55,659 --> 00:38:57,644
I was watching the movie again.

731
00:38:57,712 --> 00:38:58,645
And?

732
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:03,183
It's a good film. I like it.

733
00:39:03,267 --> 00:39:07,354
And the wardrobe is unbelievable.

734
00:39:07,438 --> 00:39:08,305
Really?

735
00:39:13,027 --> 00:39:14,844
Imagine that.

736
00:39:14,896 --> 00:39:19,199
The Wasatch Valley Film Festival.

737
00:39:24,622 --> 00:39:25,956
Hello?

738
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,475
You have 27 messages.

739
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:36,983
First message.

740
00:39:37,051 --> 00:39:39,319
Hi, mom. It's me.

741
00:39:47,408 --> 00:39:48,617
I know you're gone...

742
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:53,567
and you're not coming back, but...

743
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:56,286
I was just thinking, maybe...

744
00:39:56,354 --> 00:39:58,321
somehow I could see you again

745
00:39:58,389 --> 00:40:01,441
or be able to talk to
you or hear your voice.

746
00:40:04,278 --> 00:40:07,414
I snapped at Jamie today again.

747
00:40:07,498 --> 00:40:10,033
And he didn't deserve it,
and I don't know why I did it.

748
00:40:10,101 --> 00:40:11,101
I just did.

749
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:19,759
He deserves better
than who I am right now.

750
00:40:19,827 --> 00:40:21,628
And so does Nathan.

751
00:40:24,015 --> 00:40:28,885
Every day we ignore how
truly broken this world is,

752
00:40:28,936 --> 00:40:33,590
and we tell ourselves
it's all going to be okay.

753
00:40:38,279 --> 00:40:41,898
But it's not gonna be
okay. I know that now.
