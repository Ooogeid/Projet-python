1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Previously on One Tree Hill.

1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,280
You scared a lot of these guys.

1
00:00:03,367 --> 00:00:06,534
This league is their nba,
and they know it's not yours.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,667
If continuing this
pregnancy means i lose you,

3
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:11,067
then we end it.

4
00:00:11,134 --> 00:00:12,734
I'm having this baby.

5
00:00:12,801 --> 00:00:15,734
<i>We're having this baby.</i>

6
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:16,534
I'm here because
i can't live without you,

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,734
millicent huxtable.

8
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:21,667
I think
we should end this.

9
00:00:21,734 --> 00:00:24,101
You deserve
more than this.

10
00:00:24,168 --> 00:00:25,534
I'm calling
the lawyers tomorrow,

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,201
and i'm divesting my interest
in clothes over bros.

12
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:29,400
Now you have a company
and no daughter.

13
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:30,567
Sam.

14
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,400
Maybe it's time we write
our own epic love story.

15
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:38,767
This time tomorrow,

16
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:40,400
we could be walking
on a beach in malibu.

17
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:42,201
But what about sam?

18
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:44,300
He loves you.
He's a great guy.

19
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:46,801
He wants us all
to try it out together.

20
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:49,001
<i>God, you have to go.
You have to.</i>

21
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:51,867
You're not coming.
I have a life here, and...

22
00:00:51,934 --> 00:00:53,634
goodbye, brooke davis.

23
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:10,734
Sam, cut it out!

24
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:12,534
Well, well.

25
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,767
Oh, my eyes!

26
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:18,234
It's called sunlight.

27
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,234
<i>And it's not
that bright.</i>

28
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,101
It is not the sun.

29
00:01:22,168 --> 00:01:24,534
It's your face.
Wha...

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,333
what the hell
are you doing here?

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,001
Last time we talked

32
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:31,101
was the last time
i wanted us to talk ever!

33
00:01:31,168 --> 00:01:33,001
We need to discuss
the business.

34
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:34,567
I'm not part
of the business anymore,

35
00:01:34,634 --> 00:01:36,034
which is exactly
what you wanted.

36
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:37,667
You got a company.
You lost a daughter.

37
00:01:37,734 --> 00:01:40,067
Now get out!

38
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:42,134
Whatever.

39
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:45,400
You pull yourself together.
I'll be back.

40
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:47,667
Why?!

41
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,300
Oh, no, sam.

42
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,134
Hey.

43
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:57,801
Are you okay?

44
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,867
She frightens me.

45
00:01:59,934 --> 00:02:01,801
Yeah.

46
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:03,967
Me too.

47
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:07,034
Let's go. Let's go, baby.
Let's go.

48
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Look out. Look out. Look out.
Come on, block that.

49
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:16,967
Good job, guys.

50
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:18,767
Nice work, nate.

51
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:21,234
Nino,
take the point.

52
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,034
Run it again.

53
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,201
Let's go, baby.
Let's go, baby.

54
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:29,500
Oh, oh, here it comes.
Here it comes.

55
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,268
Ball, ball, ball.

56
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,834
Oh, yeah.

57
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:38,567
Great.
Great job, guys.

58
00:02:38,634 --> 00:02:40,801
Good practice.
Hit the showers.

59
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,168
Nathan.

60
00:02:50,234 --> 00:02:51,634
It seems
i've got a problem.

61
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,300
My two best players
are playing the same position.

62
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:56,534
If we're gonna have a chance
at winning,

63
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,834
i need you and nino
on the court together.

64
00:02:58,901 --> 00:03:01,567
So, i'm moving back
to shooting guard.

65
00:03:01,634 --> 00:03:03,567
No, no, i'm moving nino
to shooting guard,

66
00:03:03,634 --> 00:03:05,201
and i'm keeping you
at the point.

67
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,700
But i need for you to help him
with the transition.

68
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:10,700
Yeah, okay.

69
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:11,801
Okay.

70
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:14,101
And, nathan...

71
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:17,101
it's time for you to step up
and be a leader.

72
00:03:17,168 --> 00:03:18,667
This is your team now.

73
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,867
Hi, miss lauren.

74
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:34,333
Oh, hey, jamie.

75
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,700
Haley, hey.

76
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:37,367
I have some good news
for you.

77
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:42,067
Jamie scored through the roof
on his standardized tests.

78
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:44,734
Really?
Oh, that's great.
I know, it is.

79
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:47,234
Have you heard
of the oppenheimer
school for the gifted?

80
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,567
Yeah, i used to dream
of going there.

81
00:03:49,634 --> 00:03:51,333
Well, they tend
to monitor these things,

82
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,534
and they're really interested
in meeting with jamie.

83
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:02,867
Boop!

84
00:04:02,934 --> 00:04:05,634
It's been a long time
since we done this, dawg.

85
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:09,433
You got to be
kidding me.

86
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:13,067
Bam!

87
00:04:13,134 --> 00:04:16,300
Look, i'm sorry
about the movie, bro.

88
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:17,467
Eh, thanks.

89
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:19,201
I mean, i was reluctant
about it at first.

90
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:22,067
But now that it's gone,
i miss it.

91
00:04:22,134 --> 00:04:24,101
Ain't that the way
it always is?

92
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:26,034
Yeah.

93
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:27,634
So, what's been going on
with you, huh?

94
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,567
I mean, besides being
insanely lucky at horse.

95
00:04:30,634 --> 00:04:32,767
Well, you know, coaching
jamie's basketball team,

96
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:35,101
i split up with deb,
and i took mouth on a road trip.

97
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:37,400
Whoa, whoa. Say that again.
What was that middle part?

98
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:38,634
<i>You broke up with deb?</i>

99
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,767
<i>Okay, actually,
she broke up with me.</i>

100
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:42,067
But...

101
00:04:42,134 --> 00:04:44,001
i don't know.
I'm just trying to get past it.

102
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:46,934
Yeah,
i'm sorry about that.

103
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:50,201
But, hey, at least mouth will
have someone to hang out with.

104
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:51,600
And misery loves company.

105
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,700
Actually,
mouth's doing just fine.

106
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,967
Morning.

107
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:04,367
Wow, you look so much better
in that shirt that i do.

108
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:07,367
Yeah, but you looked
so much better in my camisol c

109
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:08,600
hey, you said
you wouldn't tell.

110
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,767
Where's your head?

111
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:15,534
Happy.

112
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,268
Sorry. I don't know
why we ever waited.

113
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:21,433
Hey, as long as we ended up
here, it was worth the wait.

114
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,834
I have a surprise
for you.

115
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:25,934
You are just full of surprises,
marvin mcfadden.

116
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:27,901
Broadway tickets
to "in the heights."

117
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:29,168
Are you serious?

118
00:05:29,234 --> 00:05:30,400
You're amazing.

119
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:31,534
<i>No, you are.</i>

120
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
And i promised myself,
if i ever got you back,

121
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,967
i'd do everything i could
to make you happy.

122
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:37,433
Well, you didn't
have to do that.

123
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,168
Just being here with you
makes me happy.

124
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:41,067
Okay, good, 'cause i can
probably scalp these tickets

125
00:05:41,134 --> 00:05:42,300
for twice
what i paid for them.

126
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:43,667
<i>I'm not that happy.</i>

127
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:06,400
Hey, where are you?

128
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:09,168
Oh, you are
gonna be jealous!

129
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:11,034
Try me.

130
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:17,101
Top down, listening
to a great mia catalano song,

131
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,734
very happy to be alive.

132
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:20,534
<i>I am jealous.</i>

133
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,700
That's a great song.

134
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:22,801
It is.

135
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:24,467
And i'll be in
as soon as it ends, okay?

136
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:26,134
Bye.
Bye.

137
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,134
Luke?

138
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:00,067
She's okay.
She's gonna be all right.

139
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:01,434
They're running some tests.

140
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:03,967
And the baby?

141
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:07,767
Lucas, what's the face?
What is it? Tell me.

142
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:13,167
There were some complications
with the pregnancy ...

143
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:14,700
before the accident.

144
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,000
What are you talking about?
What complications?

145
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:20,334
Peyton has a condition
called placenta previa.

146
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:22,134
What is that?
What does that mean?

147
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:24,600
Well, it means that she runs
the risk of hemorrhaging

148
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:27,867
during pregnancy
or during delivery.

149
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:29,633
Okay.

150
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,367
But she's gonna be okay ...
her and the baby.

151
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:36,301
Yeah, yeah. If everything
goes perfectly, yes.

152
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:39,401
Lucas, come on, what if
everything doesn't go perfectly?

153
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:44,967
Well, then we could
lose her, brooke.

154
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,367
She could die, and...

155
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:51,067
and the baby, too.

156
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:04,967
Coach talk to you
about moving to shooting guard?

157
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:07,534
Maybe.
What's it to you?

158
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:11,267
He wants me
to help you out.

159
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:13,568
<i>He wants you
to help me out?</i>

160
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:15,234
That's what he said.

161
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:16,834
Well, considering how
i'm better than you,

162
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,201
there's nothing
you could teach me

163
00:08:18,267 --> 00:08:19,700
that i don't already know.

164
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:21,568
You think
you're better than me.

165
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:25,000
<i>I know i am.</i>

166
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:26,568
Okay.

167
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:29,101
Prove it.

168
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:33,934
Just like magic!

169
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,700
It's all day, scott.

170
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:38,468
All day.
Make it, take it.

171
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:47,934
Can't stop this, baby.
Come on.

172
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,667
Yeah, but you're
a two guard now,

173
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:53,401
so let's see
the jump shot.

174
00:08:53,468 --> 00:08:54,767
I won't even guard you.

175
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,034
All right.

176
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:57,101
It's all you.

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,067
That's what i thought.

178
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,134
Game point.

179
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:25,900
Next basket wins.

180
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:27,900
What are you gonna
teach me now, scott?

181
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,234
Well, if i'm the point guard,
i'll drive.

182
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:34,234
If i'm the shooting guard...

183
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:37,600
...i shoot.

184
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:38,600
Game.

185
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:40,633
Lesson's over.

186
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,101
Now, you can either learn how
to play shooting guard and start

187
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,867
or you can be
a backup point guard.

188
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:49,934
It's your choice.

189
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:03,267
I'm telling you,

190
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:06,934
that woman was like a zombie,
a vampire, and principal rimkus

191
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,334
all rolled into one.

192
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:09,867
And she's brooke's mom?

193
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:11,434
Yeah.
Totally scary.

194
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:13,834
Okay.

195
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,934
Name one thing that scares
the hell out of you ...

196
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,700
other than brooke's mom.

197
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:20,967
Being alone.

198
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:25,501
And you kissing me again.
That was gross.

199
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:26,800
Totally.

200
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:29,834
You want to know
what scares me?

201
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,301
You know
that burger king guy?
Mm-hmm.

202
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:33,800
Like the king?
Mm-hmm.

203
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,633
He scares the hell
out of me.

204
00:10:38,267 --> 00:10:42,700
So, i've been talking
to some possible foster parents.

205
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:48,434
What are they like?

206
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:50,733
They actually seem
pretty cool.

207
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,401
But...

208
00:10:52,468 --> 00:10:54,034
they live in charlotte.

209
00:10:56,934 --> 00:10:59,867
You should go.

210
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:01,334
You're going, right?

211
00:11:01,401 --> 00:11:03,934
I don't know.

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,900
Why wouldn't you go?

213
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:10,667
Being alone scares the hell
out of you.

214
00:11:11,967 --> 00:11:13,234
Hello!

215
00:11:13,301 --> 00:11:15,401
Oh, crap, it's her.
Hide.

216
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,234
You might as well stand up.

217
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:27,700
I can see
your unfortunate split ends.

218
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:40,367
What is this now?
A-a homeless shelter?

219
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:43,201
Um, i'm brooke's
foster kid, sam,

220
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:44,767
and this is jack.

221
00:11:46,468 --> 00:11:48,034
So, you're here
to sponge off my daughter

222
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:50,434
just like the rest
of her so-called friends.

223
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:55,201
Well?!

224
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:56,468
Speak!

225
00:11:56,534 --> 00:11:58,501
We don't like you.

226
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:05,134
Where's brooke?
I need to speak with her.

227
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:08,967
She's, um ...  she's actually
outside on the patio

228
00:12:09,034 --> 00:12:11,067
working on some sketches.

229
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:19,633
Well played.

230
00:12:23,434 --> 00:12:25,568
Too bad i have a key.

231
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:41,134
Hi.

232
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:42,600
Hey.

233
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,967
Hey, brooke davis,
you are not crying.

234
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:47,334
I'm okay.
It's okay.

235
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:48,767
I'm okay.

236
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,600
That's not what lucas said.

237
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,167
He told you?

238
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:56,667
<i>Why didn't you?</i>

239
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:59,201
I was going to,

240
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:01,967
but i wanted you
to go to l.a. With julian.

241
00:13:02,034 --> 00:13:04,468
And i knew that you wouldn't go
if you knew.

242
00:13:06,301 --> 00:13:08,468
You suck
for not telling me.

243
00:13:08,534 --> 00:13:11,034
And i'm not going
anywhere, so...

244
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:18,267
what are we gonna do,
p. Sawyer?

245
00:13:18,334 --> 00:13:21,067
How am i gonna help us
get through this?

246
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:24,134
I don't know.

247
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:26,201
We just will.

248
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,700
You're damn right
we will.

249
00:13:43,101 --> 00:13:44,434
Home sweet home.

250
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:46,167
Let's get you to bed.

251
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:48,667
Luke, you can
stop worrying.

252
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,334
I'm gonna worry,

253
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:52,733
and i'm gonna keep worrying
for the next few months.

254
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,700
Honey, i'm fine.
The baby's fine.

255
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,934
It's mid-afternoon.
I don't need a nap.

256
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,067
Wait.

257
00:14:01,568 --> 00:14:02,900
What's that?

258
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,633
Yeah, the baby says it's
definitely time to take a nap.

259
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,301
Good call, baby.

260
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:07,834
I agree.

261
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,568
Let's go.

262
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,367
All right, safe and sound.
Here we go.

263
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:17,700
Speaking of safe and sound,
how's the comet?

264
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:21,234
Don't worry
about the car, okay?

265
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:28,267
I'm sure it'll be okay.

266
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:36,900
Damn, that car's dead.

267
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:40,434
How in the world
diwalk away from this?

268
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:41,733
It's

269
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,767
yeah, well, it's gonna
take a second miracle

270
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:45,633
to put this thing
back together.

271
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,967
Cost more to fix it
than what it's worth.

272
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:52,234
It's worth more
than you know.

273
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,501
Oppenheimer has the best
curriculum in north carolina.

274
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,934
We even have pre-kindergarten
computer courses.

275
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,834
And all of our students
matriculate

276
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,134
to top-tier universities.

277
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:09,600
So, this is where all the kids
i beat up came from.

278
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:11,568
Why don't we have jamie
take a seat

279
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:13,967
while i show you two
the rest of the campus?

280
00:15:14,034 --> 00:15:15,134
Okay.

281
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:17,234
Just t  have fun,
okay, buddy?

282
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:18,934
Bye, buddy.

283
00:15:40,201 --> 00:15:42,201
What could possibly
be so important

284
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:44,534
that you'd bother someone
who hates you?

285
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,800
I'm here
because of the business.

286
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,401
It's in trouble.

287
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:55,067
So, it's tanking.

288
00:15:55,134 --> 00:15:57,067
Looks like
you're not the one

289
00:15:57,134 --> 00:15:59,934
who spins the straw into gold
after all.

290
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,101
It's just a little difficult
to find decent straw these days.

291
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:06,134
I need you back.

292
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:07,234
You should have thought
of that

293
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:08,600
before you hired
the second runner-up

294
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,167
from "project runway."

295
00:16:10,234 --> 00:16:11,767
I had to hire somebody.

296
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:14,800
I wasn't exactly expecting
my daughter to quit on me.

297
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:17,067
To quit on you?

298
00:16:17,134 --> 00:16:21,167
You told me you wished
i'd never been born.

299
00:16:21,234 --> 00:16:23,700
Right after you showed up
at my apartment with a gun

300
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:25,733
and accused me
of having you attacked.

301
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:31,301
Look,
we both said things.

302
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:33,334
We both were wrong.

303
00:16:36,134 --> 00:16:39,367
It doesn't matter anyway.
I'm not gonna help you.

304
00:16:39,434 --> 00:16:41,568
You're on your own.
Sorry.

305
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:44,301
Fine.

306
00:16:46,201 --> 00:16:50,000
You know, it's one thing
to refuse to help me.

307
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:51,667
But what about
all those other people

308
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:52,867
that used to work for you?

309
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:57,401
Those people
who made you who you are...

310
00:16:57,468 --> 00:16:59,501
they'll all be
out of work.

311
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:03,501
But you could
change that.

312
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:08,568
It's a shame.

313
00:17:26,034 --> 00:17:28,700
Jamie, why don't you introduce
yourself to the class?

314
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:33,500
Go ahead.
It's okay.

315
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:35,767
How's everyone doing?

316
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,001
Last week, my mom asked me
how i like going to school.

317
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:46,700
I told her, "not as much
as i like coming home from it."

318
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:51,867
Why wouldn't you want
to go to school?

319
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:57,800
Here, why don't you
put this on?

320
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:00,634
That way you'll feel
more comfortable.

321
00:18:02,034 --> 00:18:04,533
Okay, students, it
is time for recess.

322
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,700
Everyone get
your recess books out.

323
00:18:16,368 --> 00:18:19,001
It's been so beautiful
here this week.

324
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:21,334
I didn't realize
how much i missed the city.

325
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,834
Yeah, it's nice.

326
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:26,067
Remember when
i was telling you

327
00:18:26,134 --> 00:18:29,167
that maybe there is
this better version of us?

328
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,567
I think this is it.

329
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:33,201
Me too.

330
00:18:33,268 --> 00:18:35,001
Well, almost.

331
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:36,134
Why almost?

332
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:38,634
You have to go back
to tree hill tomorrow.

333
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:41,167
I wish i could stay,

334
00:18:41,234 --> 00:18:43,400
but i'm already
the world's flakiest employee.

335
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:45,334
I know.

336
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,667
Let's just enjoy today...

337
00:18:47,734 --> 00:18:49,867
this...now.

338
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,800
So, what is this?

339
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:09,368
Here at oppenheimer,
we don't offer sports.

340
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:13,134
But we do try to incorporate
them into learning exercises.

341
00:19:13,201 --> 00:19:15,301
This is called
"math-ketball."

342
00:19:15,368 --> 00:19:16,800
Math-ketball.

343
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:19,834
We have some of the best
"math-letes" in the state.

344
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:22,167
That's a three-point
"math-ket."

345
00:19:22,234 --> 00:19:27,433
In...your...face!

346
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,334
More like "math-holes."

347
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,301
There's no way
he's going here.

348
00:19:34,368 --> 00:19:35,634
Come on, jamie.
You ready?

349
00:19:38,268 --> 00:19:40,301
Thanks.

350
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:52,900
What are you doing?

351
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:54,733
You should be in bed.

352
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,834
That's why
they call it "bed rest."

353
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,234
The doctor said
take it easy.

354
00:19:58,301 --> 00:20:01,468
That doesn't mean i have to
spend every waking hour in bed.

355
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,534
Um, yes, you do.

356
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,367
So, does this mean

357
00:20:04,434 --> 00:20:06,167
you're not gonna give me
a ride to the studio?

358
00:20:07,468 --> 00:20:09,600
Um, you're not going
to the studio.

359
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,633
Look, and i'm the one
with the car,

360
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,800
and i'm not
driving you anywhere.

361
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:16,267
End of discussion.

362
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:17,534
Speaking of...

363
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,800
have you had a chance
to go look at the comet yet?

364
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:21,468
Yeah, about that...

365
00:20:21,534 --> 00:20:22,900
how bad?

366
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:24,367
Well, i...

367
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:27,534
we can get
another one, okay?

368
00:20:29,234 --> 00:20:33,067
It was just a car, peyton.

369
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:34,434
That's all.

370
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:42,134
It was the comet.

371
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:48,468
They put our son
in a cardigan.

372
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:50,434
I used to wear
cardigans.

373
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:52,867
And that's because
you were a nerd.

374
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:55,034
See, it's comments like that
that make me wish

375
00:20:55,101 --> 00:20:57,700
i'd had an opportunity to go
to a school like oppenheimer.

376
00:20:57,767 --> 00:21:01,267
Oh, yeah, and then you could
have lettered in math-ketball.

377
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:04,034
Look, that little jackass
was talking trash to our son.

378
00:21:04,101 --> 00:21:05,700
Like you've never
talked trash before?

379
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:07,134
And when somebody talks trash
to you on the court,

380
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:08,967
doesn't it motivate you?

381
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,434
<i>You know it does.
Well, jamie's not even gonna
see a court, all right?</i>

382
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:12,700
'cause they don't even
have one.

383
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:14,667
He would get
an excellent education there,

384
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,733
and there is more to school
than just sports.

385
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,434
Well, there's more to school
than just school.

386
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:20,468
This coming
from a "c" student.

387
00:21:20,534 --> 00:21:22,367
A "c" plus.

388
00:21:22,434 --> 00:21:24,867
And you were my tutor.

389
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:39,401
Ah, there's the man.

390
00:21:39,468 --> 00:21:41,800
So, how did your visit go
at that new school?

391
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:45,600
I haven't
told anyone yet.

392
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:46,700
Hey, i'm sorry,
little man.

393
00:21:46,767 --> 00:21:47,667
I didn't realize
this whole thing

394
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:48,568
was supposed to be
on the d.l.

395
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:50,900
Extreme d.l.

396
00:21:52,201 --> 00:21:54,800
Hey. I'm lauren.
I'm jamie's teacher.

397
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:56,201
Hi, i'm...

398
00:21:56,267 --> 00:21:58,101
jamie's basketball coach,
skills.

399
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:00,633
Antwon...taylor ...

400
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,834
antwon "skills" taylor.
Yes, i know.

401
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,468
Jamie talks about you
all the time.

402
00:22:04,534 --> 00:22:06,800
You know, he says you're not
very good at video games.

403
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,301
Yes, i am.

404
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:12,800
I don't really play that much
unless jamie want to play.

405
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:14,134
I let him win sometimes.

406
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:15,900
You know, got to keep
the kid's confidence up.

407
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,101
Oh, of course.
I'll see you tomorrow, jamie.

408
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:21,301
Antwon "skills" taylor.

409
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,434
Man!

410
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:27,434
You sure you want
to leave this school?

411
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,900
Well, well.

412
00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:37,934
Peyton.

413
00:22:41,201 --> 00:22:43,934
So, looks like all that good
music we've been working on

414
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,201
nearly killed you.

415
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:47,534
Yeah, good music and some idiot
running a red light.

416
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,867
Yeah, brooke told me
about the accident...

417
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:52,867
and, uh...
about everything else.

418
00:22:52,934 --> 00:22:55,501
It's all gonna
work out, haley.

419
00:22:55,568 --> 00:22:57,867
I know it will. You and lucas
always beat the odds.

420
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,867
Hey, i'm gonna need your help
with something.

421
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:03,434
Anything.

422
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:06,367
Finish producing
mia's album.

423
00:23:06,434 --> 00:23:08,800
Of course.

424
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:10,568
Because you are the one
that discovered her
in the first place.

425
00:23:10,633 --> 00:23:14,201
Well, we both did.
We're a team, remember?

426
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,167
I'll be there in spirit.
Deal?

427
00:23:18,234 --> 00:23:19,334
Deal.

428
00:23:19,401 --> 00:23:20,667
I will take care of mia,

429
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,667
and you will take care
of my niece.

430
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:24,800
Or nephew,
but i'm hoping for a niece.

431
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:25,934
Thank you.

432
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,434
You're welcome.

433
00:23:37,468 --> 00:23:39,501
Hey.

434
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:46,767
What are you
so gloomy about?

435
00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:49,800
Jack found a foster home.

436
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:53,201
He's leaving today.
He's moving to charlotte.

437
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:57,334
I'm sorry.
I know it's hard.

438
00:23:57,401 --> 00:24:00,000
Believe me, i know.

439
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:02,568
Yeah,
if that's your story.

440
00:24:02,633 --> 00:24:05,301
Hey, what is that
supposed to mean?

441
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:09,234
I think you know.

442
00:24:09,301 --> 00:24:11,800
Okay, if you want
to get into this,

443
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,401
we should get into it.

444
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:15,767
You have been moping
around the house

445
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:17,167
for the last two weeks,

446
00:24:17,234 --> 00:24:19,568
pouting about julian.

447
00:24:19,633 --> 00:24:22,067
He wanted us
to be together.

448
00:24:22,134 --> 00:24:24,667
He wanted you.
He wanted me.

449
00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:27,934
We could have been
a family!

450
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,234
Sam, you don't know
what you're talking about.

451
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:33,401
I know he loves you.

452
00:24:33,468 --> 00:24:36,733
I know ...
i know to follow my heart

453
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,600
instead of
locking it away.

454
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,101
<i>I know if i could,
i would go with jack.</i>

455
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:46,568
Sam, you're in high school.

456
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:50,301
Your love
is totally different,

457
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:52,934
and if you were older,
you would understand.

458
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,900
Do you know
who you sound like?

459
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:57,234
Victoria.

460
00:24:57,301 --> 00:24:59,234
Okay.

461
00:24:59,301 --> 00:25:03,334
That is a cheap shot,
and you know it.

462
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,800
It is so much
more complicated

463
00:25:05,867 --> 00:25:08,568
than me just doing
whatever i want.

464
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:10,301
Why?
Because of me?

465
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:12,501
<i>Not because of you.</i>

466
00:25:12,568 --> 00:25:13,800
<i>For you.</i>

467
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:16,633
I have to do
what is best for you,

468
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,101
whether or not
you see that.

469
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:21,434
Don't use me
as your excuse!

470
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:22,967
Please, just stop!

471
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:29,468
Please, just admit
that julian loved you

472
00:25:29,534 --> 00:25:34,301
and you were too scared
or too stupid to love him back!

473
00:25:41,468 --> 00:25:44,667
Tell me
about miss lauren.
If you let me score,
i'll tell you all about her.

474
00:25:47,534 --> 00:25:49,301
Thank you.

475
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:50,934
Get to talking.

476
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,934
She likes flowers.

477
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,367
Man, every girl
likes flowers.

478
00:25:53,434 --> 00:25:54,667
I need more than that.

479
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:57,101
If i give up everything,
i'll have no bargaining power.

480
00:25:57,167 --> 00:25:58,700
It's called
"supply and demand."

481
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,700
Oh, you pretty smart
for a 6-year-old.

482
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,000
Haven't you heard?
I'm a genius.

483
00:26:03,067 --> 00:26:05,401
Kid's smarter
than both of us, skills.

484
00:26:05,468 --> 00:26:07,134
Yeah, he definitely
gets that from his mama.

485
00:26:07,201 --> 00:26:08,301
Can't argue with that.

486
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:12,468
Hey.

487
00:26:12,534 --> 00:26:14,067
Can we talk?

488
00:26:14,134 --> 00:26:15,301
Yeah, sure.

489
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:16,633
You got this, skills?

490
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,733
I got this.

491
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,800
All right, one on four.
It's my ball.

492
00:26:24,468 --> 00:26:26,600
Hey.

493
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,867
Um, so,
i was thinking ...

494
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:30,101
me too.

495
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:33,101
Um, i think i was a little harsh
about the new school.

496
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:34,733
Great,
because i was thinking

497
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,733
it's probably not such
a great idea to send him there.

498
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,101
Why the change of heart?

499
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:42,101
Because he loves basketball,
and he likes his teacher.

500
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,967
He's got
all his friends there.

501
00:26:44,034 --> 00:26:46,800
And would you rather him be
a big fish in a little pond

502
00:26:46,867 --> 00:26:48,667
or a little fish
in a big pond?

503
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:50,733
That's the same reason
dan gave

504
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,234
for not sending me
to oak lake academy.

505
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,334
We want jamie to be a big fish
in a big pond.

506
00:26:58,401 --> 00:27:00,867
Dan never gave me
that option.

507
00:27:00,934 --> 00:27:02,201
Maybe jamie deserves

508
00:27:02,267 --> 00:27:05,067
to have all the opportunities
we didn't have, you know?

509
00:27:06,633 --> 00:27:08,733
So, basically,
we just flip-flopped?

510
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,301
Yeah, i guess we did.

511
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:11,700
We suck at this.

512
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:33,367
Well, it's not like
we can't visit.

513
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:36,201
We could meet up somewhere like
coachella during spring break.

514
00:27:36,267 --> 00:27:41,034
Yeah, and ...  and ...  and bonnaroo
is the last week of school.

515
00:27:41,101 --> 00:27:42,834
I don't like finals
anyway.

516
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,800
Yeah, well, you'd have to
actually go to school

517
00:27:44,867 --> 00:27:45,934
to have finals.

518
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,667
True.

519
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:50,134
Oh, and we can ...
we can do reading in august.

520
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,700
Yeah,
going across the pond.

521
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:54,401
Uh, wait, are we gonna be back
in time for burning man?

522
00:27:54,468 --> 00:27:58,067
Oh, burning man's for freaks,
so you should definitely go.

523
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,534
<i>You're the freak.</i>

524
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:09,301
I'm gonna get you
a refill.

525
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:12,167
Oh. What?

526
00:28:12,234 --> 00:28:13,401
Chicken.

527
00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:19,167
Hi.

528
00:28:19,234 --> 00:28:20,667
So, i've been wondering,

529
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:23,900
how exactly did you con
my daughter into taking you in?

530
00:28:26,034 --> 00:28:27,934
I shoplifted
from clothes over bros,

531
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,534
assaulted her, then she found me
sleeping in a car

532
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,934
and decided to take me in.

533
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,568
But i've made up for that
with my sunny disposition.

534
00:28:34,633 --> 00:28:37,367
I'm amused
on the inside.

535
00:28:37,434 --> 00:28:38,867
I'm not.

536
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:40,401
Well, you should be.

537
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:43,067
You hit the jackpot
with my daughter.

538
00:28:43,134 --> 00:28:44,401
Why so morose?

539
00:28:44,468 --> 00:28:45,967
I'm not sure
you'd understand.

540
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:47,733
You'd have to actually
have a soul.

541
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,534
Try me.

542
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:57,234
My friend jack is leaving.

543
00:28:57,301 --> 00:29:00,034
He's...moving away.

544
00:29:01,267 --> 00:29:04,067
Well, my company is called
clothes over bros,

545
00:29:04,134 --> 00:29:07,067
so i'm not exactly sympathetic
with your cause.

546
00:29:07,134 --> 00:29:09,000
I should have known
you'd be bad at this,

547
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:11,367
considering all the hurtful
things you said to brooke

548
00:29:11,434 --> 00:29:12,568
the last time you saw her.

549
00:29:12,633 --> 00:29:14,434
What would you know
about that?

550
00:29:14,501 --> 00:29:16,667
You said
you never wanted her.

551
00:29:16,733 --> 00:29:19,468
Not exactly
"mother of the year" material.

552
00:29:19,534 --> 00:29:21,067
<i>And what happened
to your mother?</i>

553
00:29:22,401 --> 00:29:23,733
She bailed.

554
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,167
So, which
would you prefer ...

555
00:29:25,234 --> 00:29:26,867
a mother who left you

556
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:30,434
or a mother who stuck around
and was bad at it?

557
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:45,934
Where's my coffee?

558
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:49,633
You're too short anyway.

559
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,334
How horrible was she?

560
00:29:53,401 --> 00:29:56,434
Uh...i-i don't know.

561
00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:02,600
Hiya, sawyer, p.e.

562
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,600
Hiya back, davis, b.p.

563
00:30:06,534 --> 00:30:07,534
How are you feeling?

564
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,633
Oh, pretty good.

565
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,733
Lucas keeps hounding me
to stay in bed.

566
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,067
We're having
a little difference of opinion

567
00:30:13,134 --> 00:30:14,934
of what
"taking it easy" means.

568
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:18,967
Well, now that we know
i'm doing fine,

569
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:20,367
what's going on with you?

570
00:30:20,434 --> 00:30:23,000
"Bitchtoria"
is back in town.

571
00:30:23,067 --> 00:30:26,867
She wants me to come back
and save the company.

572
00:30:26,934 --> 00:30:29,434
Victoria? Seriously?

573
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:31,334
And the thing is,
if i don't help her,

574
00:30:31,401 --> 00:30:33,633
all those people
who work for clothes over bros

575
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,434
are gonna lose their jobs.

576
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:38,334
I mean...

577
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:40,167
what do you think
i should do?

578
00:30:42,568 --> 00:30:45,501
I mean, i don't know
what you should do.

579
00:30:45,568 --> 00:30:48,000
<i>I know
what you will do, though.</i>

580
00:30:48,067 --> 00:30:50,067
And that is?

581
00:30:50,134 --> 00:30:53,367
You're gonna help
"vic-whoria."

582
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,468
And you're gonna help
all those people

583
00:30:57,534 --> 00:31:01,267
because you always sacrifice
to help everybody else.

584
00:31:01,334 --> 00:31:03,468
That's why we love you.

585
00:31:10,267 --> 00:31:13,067
How i told you lately
how much leaving you sucks?

586
00:31:13,134 --> 00:31:16,201
I wish you could stay.

587
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,600
We'll be the couple that makes
the long-distance thing work.

588
00:31:21,834 --> 00:31:24,101
We will, won't we?

589
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:27,568
And every time we see each other
will be like a reunion.

590
00:31:27,633 --> 00:31:29,600
Yeah.

591
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:35,534
I'll see you soon,
millie.

592
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,067
Okay.

593
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,633
Bye.

594
00:32:00,633 --> 00:32:02,267
Why?

595
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:09,167
They're here.

596
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:16,900
They're ...  they're much younger
than i expected.

597
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:18,468
Hi, jack.

598
00:32:18,534 --> 00:32:20,501
Hi, how are you?
Good.

599
00:32:20,568 --> 00:32:22,434
Hey. Dad.

600
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:23,934
Hey.
Yeah.

601
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,733
Where'd you get the vampire
weekend tour shirt? Hot topic?

602
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,468
No, bonnaroo.
Have you ever been?

603
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:32,900
It's awesome.
Yeah, we go every year.

604
00:32:34,434 --> 00:32:35,568
Fine.

605
00:32:35,633 --> 00:32:36,967
You guys rock.
I'm impressed.

606
00:32:37,034 --> 00:32:39,900
So, you must be sam

607
00:32:39,967 --> 00:32:42,000
that dominates all
of jack's conversations.

608
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:43,301
Oh, yeah.

609
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:45,900
We were ...  we were hoping
to meet his girlfriend.

610
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:48,267
She's not, uh,
my girlfriend.

611
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:49,633
Yes, i am. Hi.

612
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,501
Hi.
Hi.

613
00:32:51,568 --> 00:32:53,301
Nice to meet you.

614
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:56,134
This is sam...

615
00:32:56,201 --> 00:32:58,201
my girlfriend.

616
00:32:59,501 --> 00:33:02,000
Well, uh, i hate
to spoil the goodbye,

617
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:04,000
but, uh, we should
probably get going.

618
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,301
Yeah, yeah.

619
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:07,834
Um, you know what?
We'll be in the car, okay?

620
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,534
Um, it was really nice
meeting you, sam.

621
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,834
Yeah.

622
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,934
So...

623
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,967
i'll come back
as soon as i can.

624
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,201
Coachella's in april.

625
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:30,667
Okay.

626
00:33:33,034 --> 00:33:35,867
Uh, bye, sam.

627
00:33:38,201 --> 00:33:39,201
Bye.

628
00:33:51,934 --> 00:33:53,134
Jack!

629
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:57,934
When you kissed me,
it wasn't...

630
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:03,101
it was nice.

631
00:34:12,501 --> 00:34:14,401
That was, too.

632
00:34:48,517 --> 00:34:50,651
I don't want to leave.

633
00:34:50,717 --> 00:34:51,851
I like it here.

634
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:53,584
You mean,
you don't want to leave

635
00:34:53,651 --> 00:34:56,851
and go back
to your pro-basketball career?

636
00:34:56,917 --> 00:34:58,018
You know what happened

637
00:34:58,084 --> 00:35:00,084
to the boy that got everything
he ever wanted?

638
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:01,584
He lived happily
ever after.

639
00:35:01,651 --> 00:35:03,283
I know,
and i am happy.

640
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,550
It's just there's
this new guy, nino,

641
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:07,617
and he's a pain
in the ass.

642
00:35:07,684 --> 00:35:11,350
And bobby expects me to help him
transition to shooting guard.

643
00:35:12,851 --> 00:35:14,550
Well, i'm sure bobby
wouldn't have asked you to do it

644
00:35:14,617 --> 00:35:16,118
if he didn't think
you could handle it.

645
00:35:16,183 --> 00:35:18,250
I-i don't know, hales.

646
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:20,384
Can i talk to you guys?

647
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,517
Uh, yeah.

648
00:35:23,018 --> 00:35:26,350
What's on your genius of a mind,
little man?

649
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:28,517
Well, i've been thinking
about everything.

650
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:31,217
And i think i should get to pick
where i go to school.

651
00:35:31,283 --> 00:35:32,417
Is that right?

652
00:35:32,484 --> 00:35:35,784
Well, if you could pick,
where would you go?

653
00:35:35,851 --> 00:35:37,851
I want to stay
at my school.

654
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:40,384
I like my friends.
I like my teacher.

655
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,550
And besides,
i did good on that test

656
00:35:42,617 --> 00:35:44,617
because you guys
teach me stuff.

657
00:35:46,084 --> 00:35:47,951
And i like it that way.

658
00:35:48,018 --> 00:35:50,450
So, can i stay?

659
00:35:50,517 --> 00:35:51,951
Please?

660
00:35:52,018 --> 00:35:54,484
We'll talk about it.

661
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:57,250
I really appreciate
you coming to us though, baby.

662
00:35:57,317 --> 00:35:58,717
Okay. Good night.

663
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:00,684
Good night.
Love you.

664
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:04,651
The kid makes
a lot of sense.

665
00:36:04,717 --> 00:36:07,250
Yeah, maybe we should have
asked him first

666
00:36:07,317 --> 00:36:08,617
since he's the genius.

667
00:36:10,283 --> 00:36:13,550
You know, you could learn
a thing or two from that kid.

668
00:36:13,617 --> 00:36:15,550
Well, he and chuck
used to hate each other,

669
00:36:15,617 --> 00:36:17,317
and now he doesn't want
to leave him.

670
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,084
And your point?

671
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,084
My point is that maybe
you should go back to charleston

672
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,550
and play nice.

673
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,817
All right.

674
00:36:32,018 --> 00:36:34,751
You think third time
is gonna be the charm?

675
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:38,617
You know, i did forgive you
for falsely accusing me

676
00:36:38,684 --> 00:36:42,018
and trying to intimidate me
with a firearm.

677
00:36:42,084 --> 00:36:44,450
<i>And you think
i'm gonna forgive you?</i>

678
00:36:44,517 --> 00:36:46,183
I hope so.

679
00:36:49,617 --> 00:36:50,951
Okay.

680
00:36:51,018 --> 00:36:52,584
Here's the deal ...

681
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:56,584
i'll come back to the company
for 51% ownership.

682
00:36:56,651 --> 00:36:58,084
50/50.

683
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,084
52.

684
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,183
51.

685
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,784
Fine.

686
00:37:01,851 --> 00:37:05,384
But understand,
this is business.

687
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,984
You still don't have
a daughter.

688
00:37:24,183 --> 00:37:26,684
Nice shot.

689
00:37:26,751 --> 00:37:27,717
I know.

690
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:32,150
Why does it always have to be
so hard with you?

691
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,350
Look, you're good,
but i can make you better.

692
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:38,051
With me at the point,
you're gonna get

693
00:37:38,118 --> 00:37:39,550
more chances to score,
all right?

694
00:37:39,617 --> 00:37:40,717
I'll get you the ball.

695
00:37:40,784 --> 00:37:44,150
All you have to do
is knock down the shots.

696
00:37:44,217 --> 00:37:45,951
Oh, i'll knock down
the shots.

697
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,417
All right.

698
00:37:50,484 --> 00:37:52,118
Well, good,
'cause if you can do that,

699
00:37:52,183 --> 00:37:54,051
the scouts will come,
we'll both get noticed,

700
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:56,550
and, hopefully, we'll never have
to play with each other again.

701
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:06,051
Okay, point.

702
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:08,183
Teach me something.

703
00:38:13,283 --> 00:38:15,517
We'll start with this move
i got in the other day.

704
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,484
I'm gonna ...  i'm gonna
