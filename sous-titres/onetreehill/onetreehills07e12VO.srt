00:00:56,343 --> 00:00:58,325
It's gonna be a good show.

4
00:01:07,175 --> 00:01:08,275
Jamie?

5
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:13,436
Moving to Spain is bullsh...

6
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,138
Alex?

7
00:01:23,546 --> 00:01:26,059
Alex!

8
00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:28,395
Alex!

9
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:39,250
I got the job.

10
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:42,444
In Los Angeles.

11
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:50,303
First of all, we do not use
that kind of language ever.

12
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,439
And second of all,
Spain is not gonna be...

13
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,940
Caca del toro.

14
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,843
It is gonna be an adventure
and a learning experience.

15
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:58,445
Do you understand me, son?

16
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:03,116
Forgiveness is love, you know?

17
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,586
What did I do?

18
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:07,888
He's quoting your father now.

19
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:09,489
It's unbelievable.

20
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,759
Come on. Give it up.

21
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:17,030
Ugh. That's gross. Aah!

22
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:18,064
Yeah.

23
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:19,399
You sorry?

24
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:20,800
I guess.

25
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,602
I just wanted you to play
for the Bobcats again.

26
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,704
I know, Buddy. I'll tell you what.

27
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:26,873
You know what I do when
I'm having a bad day?

28
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:29,976
What? Go to the bar. Let's go.

29
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,978
Sweet.

30
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:35,015
It's open.

31
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:40,053
Hey. Hey.

32
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,959
I tried calling you. It
went straight to voicemail.

33
00:03:46,027 --> 00:03:49,596
Yeah. I, uh, kind of
threw my phone in the pool.

34
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:55,135
I went by your office.

35
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:58,838
I thought maybe your assistant
could help you somehow.

36
00:03:58,906 --> 00:03:59,973
It's okay.

37
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,708
No, it's not okay.

38
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:04,044
It sucks... turtle eggs.

39
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:07,380
Turtle eggs?

40
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:08,648
Really?

41
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:11,117
I don't know. It sucks something.

42
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,721
Anyway, she wanted me to tell you that,

43
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:17,891
I guess, somebody got sick,
and it's really serious.

44
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,893
Joe Turner's mom.

45
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:23,697
What?

46
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:24,965
Okay. I don't understand.

47
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,399
Tell me again what's happening.

48
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,667
Joe Turner's mom is sick.

49
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:29,336
Okay, not so good for Joe Turner's mom,

50
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:30,403
but what does that mean?

51
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:31,738
It means you did it.

52
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:33,540
I mean, well, you haven't
yet, but there's hope.

53
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,008
Awesome. For what?

54
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:37,077
Okay, Joe Turner is a center
for the Sacramento Kings,

55
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,712
and he's from a little
town near Raleigh.

56
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,547
Got it.

57
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,681
I still don't get it.

58
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:42,849
Okay, just get in. You will.

59
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:44,050
Great. Where are we going?

60
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,219
To a little town outside of Raleigh...

61
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,154
And to buy me a new blackberry.

62
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:50,090
Hey, by the way, thanks for this.

63
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,358
You're welcome.

64
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:54,194
I have no idea what
the hell is going on.

65
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,329
Grubbs. How you doing, man?

66
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:58,365
I want you to meet my son.

67
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:01,267
I mean, my old college roommate, Jamie.

68
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:02,869
How old are you, Jamie?

69
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:05,005
24, right, Jame?

70
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:07,674
Yep. I was 23 but I had a birthday.

71
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:08,742
Uh-huh.

72
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,977
And, uh, when was this birthday?

73
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:15,682
June. Maybe. It changes sometimes.

74
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:18,718
It's good enough for me.

75
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:20,353
Welcome to Tric.

76
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:21,955
Jamie, grubbs has this gift

77
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:23,923
where he can guess what
everybody likes to drink.

78
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,458
What do you say, grubbs?

79
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,360
Whiskey...

80
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,428
For your roommate.

81
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,563
And for you...

82
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,365
Beer.

83
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:33,967
Root beer.

84
00:05:34,035 --> 00:05:35,402
Ice cold.

85
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,637
Two cherries.

86
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,572
Awesome. That's totally what I wanted.

87
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:42,442
Cheers.

88
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:47,414
Yes, sir. I can be there on Monday.

89
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,315
Thank you so much.

90
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:51,851
Okay. Bye.

91
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:00,527
They want me to start on Monday.

92
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,829
I know. I heard.

93
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:04,664
Well, for what it's worth,

94
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:07,033
I think that you are gonna do great.

95
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,775
You know I love you.

96
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:17,277
I love you, too.

97
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:21,247
It's just...

98
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:23,983
You never asked me to go with you,

99
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,752
and that kind of hurt.

100
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,387
So you'd have gone with me?

101
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:29,522
'Cause, baby, if you want to go...

102
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,325
Come to Los Angeles with me.

103
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:33,426
Will you?

104
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:35,395
No.

105
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:36,830
Wait, but you just said that...

106
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:37,831
no, I know.

107
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,899
I can't.

108
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:44,170
But it's nice to be asked.

109
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:57,317
Hi.

110
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:05,425
Hi.

111
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:10,230
I can't believe I made it into heaven.

112
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:15,268
I can't believe you put me through hell.

113
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:17,837
I found you at your place.

114
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,305
You called me.

115
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:21,174
You came.

116
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:23,476
Of course I came.

117
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:26,613
That's what she said.

118
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:34,454
You're lucky, you know that?

119
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:35,955
You could've died,

120
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:39,792
and there's nothing special
or romantic about that.

121
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,662
You would have just been gone.

122
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,499
You said...

123
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:49,235
Nobody wanted me.

124
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:54,407
Well, I was wrong.

125
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:59,012
That's what I was
coming over to tell you,

126
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,580
because...

127
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:05,418
we got the financing for the movie.

128
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:09,389
So you need to get better

129
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:12,559
because we're not gonna
make it with anyone else.

130
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,064
It's okay. Rest.

131
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:20,700
I'll be here.

132
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,781
I don't know, grubbs.

133
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,984
It's like one day you're in school,

134
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,219
and your world makes sense...

135
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:45,257
friends, classes, recess.

136
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:49,027
The next day... Spain.

137
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,564
Bet they don't even
have recess in Spain.

138
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,600
Siesta. They have siesta.

139
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,338
Haley packed for her tour yet?

140
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,273
We're still dealing with Spain.

141
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:04,142
What's that?

142
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,210
Champagne.

143
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,545
I didn't order...  I know.

144
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,613
It's just, uh, kind of a gift I have.

145
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,248
I don't drink champagne.

146
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:15,754
Right. Uh, I meant, uh,
White...  White wine.

147
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,757
Dear God, no. Two
fingers of whiskey, neat.

148
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,828
Off you go.

149
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,331
So, moving to Spain, huh?

150
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,999
Oh, yeah.

151
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,201
I bet it's gonna suck.

152
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,802
Oh, I don't know about that,

153
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,304
what with all the child labor...

154
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:35,006
Oh, and the fact that they
eat children as a delicacy.

155
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,776
That was a joke.

156
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:40,612
It's a wonderful place,
Spain. You'll see.

157
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,047
I, um...

158
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:46,318
I didn't know which
kind you wanted, so...

159
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,620
Could you...

160
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,889
I just...  I didn't know.

161
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,929
So what's so great about it?

162
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,465
You said Spain was a wonderful place,

163
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,167
so what's so great about it?

164
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:03,335
Hmm.

165
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:09,007
La Tomatina.

166
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:12,144
Hi, Joe.

167
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,679
Clay Evans. I'm an agent with ISC.

168
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,018
We got the flowers. Thanks.

169
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:23,789
Well, uh, actually I'm
not with ISC anymore.

170
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,123
They fired me.

171
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,126
Tough break.

172
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:32,130
Yeah. Those seem to be going around.

173
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,932
How's your mom?

174
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,102
She has cancer.

175
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,272
I'm sorry.

176
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,875
They say she has less than a year.

177
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:47,279
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

178
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:51,149
That's my moms, man. She's all I got.

179
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,719
You ever lose anyone close to you?

180
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:58,023
Yeah.

181
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:02,327
How do you deal with
that, man? What do you do?

182
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,697
You remember the good things...

183
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,934
And the days that you did have.

184
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,271
Joe, would it help you

185
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,240
if you could play closer
to home next season?

186
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,913
I stole a dress from Brooke...

187
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,815
an expensive one.

188
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,617
Of all the people to steal from,

189
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,420
Brooke is the one who trusted
you and helped you the most.

190
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:31,990
You got to talk to her.

191
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,458
The truth.

192
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:42,400
I remember looking in that mirror

193
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,971
and telling you how special you are.

194
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,574
How can you not see that?

195
00:11:49,855 --> 00:11:54,391
Marvin, when I look at that mirror,

196
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,782
I just want to cut a
line on it and snort it.

197
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,088
That's what I see.

198
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,329
We have no further comment at this time.

199
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,100
How's she doing?

200
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,902
She's gonna be okay...

201
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:21,006
as okay as anyone can be
after a suicide attempt.

202
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,407
Uh, exhaustion.

203
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:23,408
What?

204
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,876
To the press.

205
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,278
They don't know that you fired her,

206
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,479
so we say it's exhaustion,

207
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:28,947
they speculate, sell magazines...

208
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,582
everybody's happy.

209
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,484
Except Alex.

210
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,819
I don't know, mom.

211
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,054
She's a mess.

212
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,790
Millie got arrested.
I'm fighting with Julian.

213
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,259
At least it can't get any worse.

214
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:45,130
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

215
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,765
Where's the red dress?

216
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,466
That's a good question.

217
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,436
And the answer is... Millicent stole it.

218
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,105
Why would she steal from us?

219
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,307
You should ask her that.

220
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,949
I'm mad at you.

221
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:07,719
You know what happens
when you die, Alex?

222
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,623
You're dead.

223
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:14,192
That's what happens.

224
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,038
I was talking about pens.

225
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,176
The last thing I said
to Sara before she died.

226
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,613
She went to grab a drink,

227
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,582
and I was babbling about
the pen I was using.

228
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,986
And then she was gone.

229
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:44,589
Sometimes I think
that we waste our words

230
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,891
and we waste our moments

231
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,693
and we don't take the
time to say the things

232
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,196
that are in our hearts
when we have the chance.

233
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,201
Sara knew you loved her.

234
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,473
You told me you held her and you
danced with her before she died,

235
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,422
and... I couldn't think of
a better way to say goodbye.

236
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:14,252
How do you say goodbye?

237
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:21,326
I know what some of you are thinking.

238
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,895
That this is wrong.

239
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:27,832
That it's cruel and insensitive

240
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,801
and malicious towards
the families and memories

241
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:34,773
of James Edwards and Keith Scott.

242
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,408
Well, it is.

243
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:44,883
There's a speech I'm supposed
to read, but I'm not going to...

244
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,155
because this is my final show.

245
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,758
And up until this
moment, nobody knew that.

246
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:58,697
So, as I stand before you, live,
it's time to tell the truth.

247
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:02,867
About me. About you.

248
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:06,137
About life.

249
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,506
So you might want to stick around...

250
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,744
because, by the look on my wife's face,

251
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:14,512
there's gonna be a few surprises.

252
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,148
After this.

253
00:15:28,056 --> 00:15:29,723
Hey, you guys were really close

254
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,559
to signing Derek McDaniel, right?

255
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:32,827
Right, I thought so.

256
00:15:32,894 --> 00:15:35,629
Well, what if I told you
I could get him for you?

257
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:38,065
You know the Bobcats
desperately need a center,

258
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,767
and you know Joe's situation.

259
00:15:39,835 --> 00:15:41,769
I think i've got a way to make it work.

260
00:15:45,607 --> 00:15:48,342
I can't get inside.

261
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,743
I know he's here. That's his car.

262
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:53,013
You mean the one that
says "Bobcats G.M."

263
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:54,148
On the license plate?

264
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:55,216
You're good.

265
00:15:55,283 --> 00:15:56,417
Yeah. You're funny.

266
00:15:56,484 --> 00:15:57,985
And anyway, I'm not that good.

267
00:15:58,053 --> 00:15:59,386
He won't even take my calls,

268
00:15:59,454 --> 00:16:01,722
and without his okay, I
can't get inside to see him.

269
00:16:06,027 --> 00:16:08,729
Unless...

270
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:13,834
You so owe me.

271
00:16:13,902 --> 00:16:16,203
I do. I do owe you.

272
00:16:19,574 --> 00:16:21,008
Oh, nice one.

273
00:16:21,076 --> 00:16:23,110
Jamie, move around this
time. Give us a moving target.

274
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,081
Whoa! What is going on here?

275
00:16:27,148 --> 00:16:30,084
La tomatina. It's a
tomato fight in Spain.

276
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:32,419
You said you needed
tomatoes for spaghetti sauce.

277
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:33,754
What kind of grown men

278
00:16:33,822 --> 00:16:35,890
stand around and throw
tomatoes at a 7-year-old?

279
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:38,959
You want to throw one, don't you?

280
00:16:39,027 --> 00:16:40,895
Yes, I do.

281
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:46,467
Oh!

282
00:16:48,236 --> 00:16:49,637
It's so on.

283
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:52,072
Aah! Take cover, Jamie!

284
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:59,313
Hi, gene.

285
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:01,282
I thought they fired you.

286
00:17:01,349 --> 00:17:02,549
They did.

287
00:17:02,617 --> 00:17:05,519
Well, you're tenacious.
I'll give you that.

288
00:17:05,587 --> 00:17:06,820
Impress me.

289
00:17:06,888 --> 00:17:09,256
What if I told you I
could get a proven big man

290
00:17:09,324 --> 00:17:11,225
that's about to become an all-star

291
00:17:11,293 --> 00:17:12,526
to waive his no-trade clause

292
00:17:12,594 --> 00:17:13,894
because he wants to come
play for the Bobcats?

293
00:17:13,962 --> 00:17:17,831
I'd say you're too late, Clay.

294
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:20,267
Joe Turner's mom is sick.

295
00:17:20,335 --> 00:17:22,569
Joe Turner.

296
00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:25,506
She has cancer. They say she has a year.

297
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:28,342
Joe wants to play close
to home next season.

298
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,244
I think he'd make a
great long-term deal

299
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:31,512
in order to do that.

300
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:33,514
You guys wanted him
during the draft, gene.

301
00:17:33,581 --> 00:17:35,549
Joe Turner's a great player.

302
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:37,952
But you know we signed Derek McDaniel.

303
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:39,954
And you wanted a center...

304
00:17:40,021 --> 00:17:42,056
Which brings me to this.

305
00:17:42,123 --> 00:17:44,992
How do you feel about
trading Derek McDaniel?

306
00:17:50,565 --> 00:17:52,900
You're next. Go.

307
00:18:34,943 --> 00:18:36,710
Sacramento's already
agreed to a sign-and-trade.

308
00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:39,313
They finally get McDaniel,
you guys get Turner, and...

309
00:18:39,381 --> 00:18:40,314
hold on.

310
00:18:40,382 --> 00:18:42,850
What the hell is that?

311
00:19:02,437 --> 00:19:05,239
Wow.

312
00:19:54,522 --> 00:19:55,923
Yeah! Whoo!

313
00:19:58,326 --> 00:20:01,462
Sucks to be next!

314
00:20:16,177 --> 00:20:17,544
We all fail.

315
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:22,950
Some of us have the fortitude
to pick ourselves up,

316
00:20:23,017 --> 00:20:26,954
and some of us will never have that.

317
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:28,989
Some of us have Grace in our hearts

318
00:20:29,057 --> 00:20:31,325
and the ability to show compassion.

319
00:20:33,595 --> 00:20:34,928
And some of us don't.

320
00:20:40,268 --> 00:20:43,770
I'm a wealthy man, but let's face it...

321
00:20:43,838 --> 00:20:46,340
you shouldn't be able to
murder someone in cold blood

322
00:20:46,407 --> 00:20:49,710
and profit from it.

323
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:53,696
So as of this moment,
I'm giving it all back.

324
00:20:55,692 --> 00:20:57,404
All of it.

325
00:20:57,886 --> 00:21:01,755
To charities and non-profits...

326
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:04,725
and the people who deserve it...

327
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:06,460
because I don't.

328
00:21:08,663 --> 00:21:11,231
Now it's time for me to go.

329
00:21:32,284 --> 00:21:35,120
I'm gonna miss this place.

330
00:21:35,187 --> 00:21:37,489
My first big show was right here.

331
00:21:37,556 --> 00:21:41,593
I like the bathrooms, too.

332
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:46,297
I'm gonna miss it.

333
00:21:52,071 --> 00:21:54,172
I'll miss the stadiums.

334
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,276
There's nothing like an
NBA arena on a game night.

335
00:21:58,344 --> 00:22:00,879
Boston. Madison Square garden.

336
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:03,181
I'll miss that.

337
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:06,484
What are you gonna miss, Jame?

338
00:22:06,552 --> 00:22:07,786
Grandpa Dan.

339
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:16,594
I've talked a lot about forgiveness.

340
00:22:16,662 --> 00:22:18,663
As you can imagine,

341
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:20,632
a man like me has to believe in it.

342
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:26,304
But I don't.

343
00:22:26,372 --> 00:22:29,207
Forgiveness doesn't exist.

344
00:22:34,346 --> 00:22:38,316
There's simply what you
do... and how you pay for it.

345
00:22:38,384 --> 00:22:40,452
So remember that

346
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:43,521
when you practice whatever
evil's in your heart...

347
00:22:43,589 --> 00:22:46,191
or when you cheat or
steal or lust or hate

348
00:22:46,258 --> 00:22:49,327
or gossip or covet or
whatever it is that you do

349
00:22:49,395 --> 00:22:53,298
or you're planning to
do or you have done.

350
00:22:53,365 --> 00:22:55,667
There is no forgiveness.

351
00:22:55,735 --> 00:23:00,538
There's just what comes next.

352
00:23:00,606 --> 00:23:04,442
Take it from someone who's
been there, who is there.

353
00:23:08,214 --> 00:23:11,449
There's only pain...

354
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:14,252
and guilt...

355
00:23:15,592 --> 00:23:19,241
and the misery of knowing
who you are and what you did.

356
00:23:25,131 --> 00:23:27,632
So don't do it.

357
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,602
Just stop... before it's too late.

358
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:50,522
I miss you, big brother.

359
00:23:50,589 --> 00:23:53,591
Every second of every day.

360
00:23:58,864 --> 00:24:00,532
It's there.

361
00:24:04,036 --> 00:24:06,404
And that's all there is.

362
00:24:12,678 --> 00:24:16,047
You ready to sign some
contracts, Jameson?

363
00:24:16,115 --> 00:24:18,116
They'll be here soon.

364
00:24:18,184 --> 00:24:19,517
I guess.

365
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:41,239
I know that playing overseas

366
00:24:41,307 --> 00:24:43,508
isn't what you hoped for, son.

367
00:24:43,576 --> 00:24:46,811
I just liked it when you
played for the Bobcats.

368
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:48,680
Yeah, I did, too.

369
00:24:48,747 --> 00:24:52,851
But my agents did the best they could.

370
00:24:52,918 --> 00:24:55,687
So did Clay, but you fired him.

371
00:25:01,026 --> 00:25:03,494
What are you thinking?

372
00:25:03,562 --> 00:25:06,464
You know how you're afraid of the ocean?

373
00:25:06,532 --> 00:25:08,433
And the reason you gave me?

374
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,403
Immensity...  because it's so immense.

375
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:14,839
Well, I was thinking...

376
00:25:16,942 --> 00:25:19,310
the ocean's not so immense.

377
00:25:19,378 --> 00:25:20,845
Life is immense.

378
00:25:20,913 --> 00:25:24,716
But we bravely go into it every day...

379
00:25:24,783 --> 00:25:27,285
Just like you did today.

380
00:25:32,024 --> 00:25:34,592
You know, I might need an
agent if I make the squad.

381
00:25:35,961 --> 00:25:38,463
You're a terrible dancer.

382
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,597
That's not fair.

383
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:41,299
It's a turn-on, actually. Oh, yeah.

384
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:42,867
It worked for me for some reason.

385
00:25:48,374 --> 00:25:52,043
This all seems pretty selfish.

386
00:25:52,111 --> 00:25:54,812
You go out and walk these halls,

387
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,317
and you will see people
fighting for another day of life.

388
00:25:59,385 --> 00:26:00,618
Another hour.

389
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:02,520
Another minute.

390
00:26:05,024 --> 00:26:06,891
I don't know, Alex.

391
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:11,462
This all feels pretty selfish to me.

392
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:15,466
Is she gonna be okay?

393
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:17,635
She's gonna live.

394
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:20,405
It's debatable with you.

395
00:26:26,145 --> 00:26:30,081
I'm sorry.

396
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:32,784
I said terrible things to Alex

397
00:26:32,851 --> 00:26:37,197
and I stole the dress from
you and I'm just sorry.

398
00:26:38,257 --> 00:26:42,493
Why, Millie? What happened to you?

399
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:44,762
I was trying to lose weight...

400
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,899
And I was trying to look
like the other girls,

401
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:51,502
and it was just there
in Alex's closet, and...

402
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,105
Drugs.

403
00:26:55,975 --> 00:26:57,675
Cocaine.

404
00:27:03,015 --> 00:27:05,216
Okay.

405
00:27:07,987 --> 00:27:10,688
You're not my model anymore.

406
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:14,726
But you're still my friend.

407
00:27:14,793 --> 00:27:17,662
Just go get some help.

408
00:27:25,004 --> 00:27:27,972
I'm proud of you for
getting help, Millie.

409
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,542
I wish there was more I could do.

410
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,745
Maybe I could stay.

411
00:27:33,812 --> 00:27:36,981
You can't.

412
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:39,283
I have to do it alone.

413
00:27:39,351 --> 00:27:43,054
But we were pretty good together, huh?

414
00:27:43,122 --> 00:27:45,356
We were great together.

415
00:27:45,424 --> 00:27:46,891
It's just...

416
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:49,327
Sometimes, people don't make it.

417
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:54,565
I'm gonna miss you.

418
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:56,267
Me too.

419
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,912
I will always be there
for you, sweet girl.

420
00:28:35,074 --> 00:28:38,042
That's not a very good
shooting percentage.

421
00:28:41,914 --> 00:28:43,614
Hi.

422
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:57,962
I came here to tell you two things.

423
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,965
The first is that I love you

424
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:03,701
and I miss you and I
want to be with you.

425
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:07,071
And the second is...

426
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:09,674
I'm gonna make that movie with Alex.

427
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:21,085
When did you meet Peyton?

428
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:25,723
In L.A. You know that.

429
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:29,026
No. Specifically, the
moment you met her.

430
00:29:29,094 --> 00:29:32,296
She had just broken up with Lucas,

431
00:29:32,364 --> 00:29:35,199
and she was crying in the
copy room of a record label.

432
00:29:35,267 --> 00:29:37,502
And when did we start being us?

433
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:41,305
You needed help with Sam.

434
00:29:41,373 --> 00:29:42,907
And now Alex.

435
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,950
My mom used to be the
most amazing woman.

436
00:29:53,018 --> 00:29:56,254
She had this magic inside her.

437
00:29:56,321 --> 00:30:02,136
And after a while, she
felt unloved or unworthy.

438
00:30:02,728 --> 00:30:04,228
I don't know.

439
00:30:04,296 --> 00:30:08,266
My dad was always working,
and I was just a kid.

440
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:12,103
I was always gone, just
doing whatever kids do.

441
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,178
No one reminded her how special she was.

442
00:30:20,245 --> 00:30:23,080
No one tried to stop her
when she took that extra drink

443
00:30:23,148 --> 00:30:25,283
or those extra pills.

444
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:29,187
And...

445
00:30:29,254 --> 00:30:34,158
Eventually, her fire burned out.

446
00:30:34,226 --> 00:30:38,196
And she became the
not-so-special person

447
00:30:38,263 --> 00:30:40,331
she thought she was all along.

448
00:30:45,103 --> 00:30:50,508
Julian, you can't fix
your mom by fixing Alex.

449
00:30:55,414 --> 00:31:02,753
But maybe I can help her
before her fire burns out.

450
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:07,325
And if not... at least I tried.

451
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,149
Nathan, you're about to
be $7 million wealthier.

452
00:31:27,217 --> 00:31:29,151
And we couldn't be happier.

453
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:34,122
Uncle Clay.

454
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:37,893
What's up, Buddy? Oh, man, I missed you.

455
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:40,462
Not as much as your
aunt Quinn missed you.

456
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,830
Something we can do for you, Clay?

457
00:31:41,898 --> 00:31:42,998
You? No.

458
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:45,834
But there is something
I can do for Nathan.

459
00:31:45,902 --> 00:31:47,236
We don't have time for this.

460
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,244
Sure we do.

461
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,581
Nate, I never said this to you or Haley,

462
00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:03,318
but I was aggressive and
arrogant negotiating your deal,

463
00:32:03,386 --> 00:32:07,356
and along the way, I
forgot that I work for you.

464
00:32:07,423 --> 00:32:09,858
And the client comes first.

465
00:32:09,926 --> 00:32:11,827
Now, it sounds like my former agency

466
00:32:11,894 --> 00:32:14,162
got you a pretty good
deal to play overseas,

467
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,532
but I always thought
of you as an NBA player.

468
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,268
And that was always the dream.

469
00:32:19,335 --> 00:32:20,302
Right, Jamie?

470
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,403
Right.

471
00:32:21,471 --> 00:32:23,772
'Cause Spain is caca del toro.

472
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,240
So this morning,

473
00:32:25,308 --> 00:32:28,176
I negotiated you a deal
to live that dream...

474
00:32:28,244 --> 00:32:30,846
in the NBA... with the Sacramento Kings.

475
00:32:30,913 --> 00:32:35,350
Nathan, we have a good deal here.

476
00:32:35,418 --> 00:32:36,685
That's true.

477
00:32:36,753 --> 00:32:40,956
You know, $7 million is a
good deal to play overseas.

478
00:32:41,024 --> 00:32:43,725
Or you could take $15
million from the Kings.

479
00:32:45,028 --> 00:32:47,329
Now, the deal does come
with a few conditions.

480
00:32:47,397 --> 00:32:48,730
Three, actually.

481
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:52,267
One, you have to leave
ISC and sign with me.

482
00:32:52,335 --> 00:32:54,403
You'll be my second client.

483
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,738
Two, your deal comes
with a no-trade clause.

484
00:32:56,806 --> 00:32:58,340
Gonna need you to waive that...

485
00:32:58,408 --> 00:33:00,309
Because if you sign with the Kings...

486
00:33:00,376 --> 00:33:02,511
they've agreed to trade
you and Joe Turner tonight!

487
00:33:04,647 --> 00:33:06,815
I'm sorry. I love that part.

488
00:33:06,883 --> 00:33:10,819
They've agreed to trade
you and Joe Turner...

489
00:33:10,887 --> 00:33:13,288
to the Charlotte Bobcats.

490
00:33:13,356 --> 00:33:17,025
What? Oh, my God!

491
00:33:17,093 --> 00:33:20,896
Oh, my...

492
00:33:20,963 --> 00:33:22,898
you're gonna be a Bobcat!

493
00:33:22,965 --> 00:33:25,067
Oh, I threw my jersey away.

494
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:31,506
Clay, how did this happen?

495
00:33:31,574 --> 00:33:34,076
With a lot of help from Quinn...

496
00:33:34,143 --> 00:33:37,546
Which brings me to my last condition.

497
00:33:37,613 --> 00:33:39,381
I want to be your agent, Nate,

498
00:33:39,449 --> 00:33:41,283
but if you're gonna sign with me,

499
00:33:41,351 --> 00:33:44,019
you need to know that I
plan on falling completely

500
00:33:44,087 --> 00:33:45,754
and insanely in love with Quinn.

501
00:33:49,092 --> 00:33:51,193
All right.

502
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:54,796
I got to go to work.

503
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:52,754
I got to go. Yeah.

504
00:35:01,764 --> 00:35:03,799
This doesn't mean that I don't love you.

505
00:35:03,866 --> 00:35:06,868
It's okay.

506
00:35:06,936 --> 00:35:09,604
'Cause I do love you, Lauren...

507
00:35:09,672 --> 00:35:11,306
And I always will.

508
00:35:11,374 --> 00:35:14,476
I love you, too.

509
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:25,720
So you're telling me
there's nothing left.

510
00:35:25,788 --> 00:35:26,788
He gave it all away.

511
00:35:26,856 --> 00:35:28,690
He did leave you this.

512
00:35:31,027 --> 00:35:33,061
Divorce papers.

513
00:35:33,129 --> 00:35:36,431
Well, that's gonna cost him.

514
00:35:36,499 --> 00:35:38,467
Cost him what? There's nothing left.

515
00:36:03,826 --> 00:36:06,561
Nathan.

516
00:36:06,629 --> 00:36:10,165
I heard about the show.

517
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:15,370
I'm gonna re-sign with the Bobcats.

518
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,909
Well, thank you for
helping me get there.

519
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:26,114
Your grandson wants to say goodbye.

520
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:32,721
Are you leaving, grandpa Dan?

521
00:36:32,788 --> 00:36:35,390
I have to.

522
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:37,926
Why?

523
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:47,536
I've done a lot of bad things, Jamie.

524
00:36:47,603 --> 00:36:48,870
And I'm sorry.

525
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:54,409
It's okay. I forgive you.

526
00:38:06,415 --> 00:38:09,484
Can you guys tell us how
this all happened so fast?

527
00:38:09,552 --> 00:38:12,320
Well...

528
00:38:12,388 --> 00:38:15,991
We have a really, really good agent.

529
00:38:21,697 --> 00:38:22,998
Hey!

530
00:38:26,135 --> 00:38:28,570
What are you doing?

531
00:38:28,638 --> 00:38:30,905
Facing the immensity, I guess.

532
00:38:33,409 --> 00:38:35,043
I'll come in.

533
00:38:35,111 --> 00:38:36,511
No.

534
00:38:39,382 --> 00:38:41,883
I'll come out.

535
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:04,272
Did you mean what you said?

536
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,108
About falling in love with me?

537
00:39:07,176 --> 00:39:09,411
Insanely in love.

538
00:39:09,478 --> 00:39:10,412
Yeah.

539
00:39:53,222 --> 00:39:55,724
I'm sorry.

540
00:39:57,593 --> 00:40:00,295
I know.

541
00:40:00,362 --> 00:40:03,164
But I need you to understand something.

542
00:40:03,232 --> 00:40:06,835
If you ever try this again...

543
00:40:06,902 --> 00:40:08,903
I'll never forgive you.

544
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:13,242
I won't miss you. I
won't think of you at all.

545
00:40:14,877 --> 00:40:18,346
So promise me you won't.

546
00:40:18,414 --> 00:40:22,317
I promise.

547
00:40:28,891 --> 00:40:30,458
Okay.

548
00:40:30,526 --> 00:40:32,927
Let's make our movie.

549
00:41:00,756 --> 00:41:02,824
I'm sorry. We're closed.

550
00:41:02,892 --> 00:41:04,292
I know.

551
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,227
I'm Alexander Coyne.

552
00:41:07,963 --> 00:41:12,667
I guess Victoria didn't tell you.

553
00:41:12,735 --> 00:41:14,602
She hired me for your men's line.

554
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,642
I'm your new designer.
