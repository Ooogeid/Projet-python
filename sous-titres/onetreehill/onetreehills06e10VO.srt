00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,000
Previous on One Tree Hill

2
00:00:03,743 --> 00:00:04,877
Hey. I'm fine. see?

3
00:00:04,877 --> 00:00:07,578
Don't play slamball anymore, daddy.

4
00:00:08,147 --> 00:00:09,647
What your version of grounded?

5
00:00:09,682 --> 00:00:12,110
One week for letting some skeevy fratvestite

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,502
Ruin peyton's wedding dress,

7
00:00:13,502 --> 00:00:15,107
And we're gonna tack on another week

8
00:00:15,107 --> 00:00:16,398
For throwing an underage keg party in

9
00:00:16,398 --> 00:00:18,456
Your foster parent's upscale boutique.

10
00:00:18,456 --> 00:00:20,240
How about we do that u.s.o. show?

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,440
You'd do that?

12
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,940
Sure. that's what family does, right?

13
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,463
Don't.

14
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:27,799
Gigi, I have a girlfriend.

15
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,500
And she doesn't have to know.

16
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,614
you've gotten even more beautiful.

17
00:00:33,614 --> 00:00:34,884
What are you doing here, julian?

18
00:00:34,884 --> 00:00:37,232
Haven't you heard I'm optioning your fiance's book.

19
00:00:37,232 --> 00:00:38,219
Like hell you are.

20
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,150
Actually, it's already done.

21
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,637
I'm quite charming.

22
00:00:41,637 --> 00:00:43,300
But you know that, baby.

23
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,200
I need to tell you something.

24
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,000
Does it involve this?

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,200
We were in love.

26
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,800
Hey, marines!

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,400
How's everybody doing tonight?

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,438
All right, that's fantastic.

29
00:01:06,472 --> 00:01:09,000
It is so great to be here tonight!

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,571
Now, I am so pumped to

31
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,178
introduce our first act tonight.

32
00:01:12,178 --> 00:01:15,880
She is a very dear friend of mine and also an amazing talent.

33
00:01:15,915 --> 00:01:19,851
Please give it up for haley james scott!

34
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,034
Haley?

35
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:44,736
Hey, I'm in here.

36
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,600
How'd it go at the doctor's?

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,050
That is so not funny.

38
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,350
Yeah, I guess you're right.

39
00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:58,183
I'm fine.

40
00:02:58,217 --> 00:03:00,800
I'm supposed to take it easy for a few days, that's all.

41
00:03:01,387 --> 00:03:03,700
So, are you excited for the u.s.o. show?

42
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,724
Honestly, no.

43
00:03:05,758 --> 00:03:08,190
I had this nightmare last night

44
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,630
That I got up onstage and I forgot the words to my song.

45
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,805
I completely forgot. I just stood there.

46
00:03:13,805 --> 00:03:16,713
What am I gonna do if that happens tonight?

47
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:19,435
Do you have any instrumental hits?

48
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:21,760
It was just a dream, haley.

49
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,301
You're gonna be great, okay?

50
00:03:23,301 --> 00:03:25,600
And I can't wait to see my sexy girl onstage.

51
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,407
Not a chance. the doctor said you should stay home and relax,

52
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:29,850
And you need to listen to him.

53
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,247
I think I can handle a concert.

54
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:32,683
Not gonna happen. besides,

55
00:03:32,683 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't want to overwhelm you with my sexiness

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,500
When I throw up all over the stage.

57
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,100
Come on.

58
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,504
Do you remember the first time you sang to me at the cafe?

59
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:44,973
Well, if you get nervous, just close your eyes

60
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:46,575
And pretend like you're back there

61
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:49,378
And it's just you and me, all right?

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,560
yeah. I like that. thank you.

63
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,514
I love you, nathan scott.

64
00:03:56,514 --> 00:03:57,814
I love you.

65
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,300
You said, "okay."

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,795
Last night, when I told you that julian and I used to be in love,

67
00:04:07,795 --> 00:04:08,900
You said, "okay."

68
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,200
Okay.

69
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,650
No, no, you can't just say it's okay, all right?

70
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,930
You're supposed to be jealous

71
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,100
Or ask questions...

72
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,001
Or get mad.

73
00:04:19,222 --> 00:04:20,722
Okay.

74
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,000
You can stop with the okays!

75
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400
It's not okay.

76
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,600
Are they okay?

77
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,300
Delicious.

78
00:04:40,335 --> 00:04:42,950
But, you know, my complete guide to raising a teenager

79
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,600
Says that if your teen cooks for you,

80
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,450
They're likely to ask for something or confess to something.

81
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,870
So let me just tell you right now

82
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,590
Whatever you did, I am so impressed.

83
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,100
You're not in trouble.

84
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,088
I just wanted to do something nice for you.

85
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:56,120
Really?

86
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,720
Besides, I think that book said

87
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,145
Breakfast in bed and doing the dishes after,

88
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:01,650
which is not happening.

89
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,970
I see.

90
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,600
So, are you excited to work for peyton at the concert tonight,

91
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Get backstage with angels & airwaves?

92
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,867
Yeah.

93
00:05:10,902 --> 00:05:13,270
Yeah, I guess it'll be pretty cool.

94
00:05:14,672 --> 00:05:17,374
No. let the machine get it.

95
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:18,800
I want to enjoy this time with you,

96
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,178
Which my book says will rarely, if ever, happen.

97
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:23,947
You've reached brooke davis. you know what to do.

98
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,780
Hi, brooke, it's patricia from the adoption agency.

99
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,820
I need to speak with you regarding placement for a newborn.

100
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,120
Please call me as soon as possible.

101
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:40,011
Wow. you're like the new angelina.

102
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,367
Hey, it's me.

103
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:57,270
Millie? hi. how are you?

104
00:05:57,304 --> 00:06:00,239
Great. what'd you do last night?

105
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:01,707
Uh, last night?

106
00:06:01,742 --> 00:06:05,511
I-i just worked again late. I worked late.

107
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:07,810
Well, I just wanted to let you know that I'm back,

108
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,181
And I'll be home shortly.

109
00:06:09,216 --> 00:06:12,184
Oh, great, shortly. t-that's awesome.

110
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:14,554
How long do you think you'll be?

111
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:16,088
Uh, 5, maybe 10 minutes?

112
00:06:18,926 --> 00:06:21,928
Okay, great. I'll -- I'll see you then.

113
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:23,195
See you then.

114
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,100
Oh, and, marvin, can you do one small thing for me

115
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,700
Before I get there?

116
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,400
Yeah, sure, anything.

117
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Get that slut out of my bed.

118
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,000
Oh, hey, luke. how you doing?

119
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,000
It's okey of the movie?

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,534
Hell, no.

121
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:54,500
Why not?

122
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,600
Why not?

123
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,200
The entire time the guy's been in town,

124
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,300
He's been pretending not to know peyton.

125
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm sure he has his reasons.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,570
Bro, I came over here

127
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,832
So that you could compliment me on knocking the guy out.

128
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:07,735
I'm just saying sometimes it's better to walk away.

129
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:09,583
Who are you right now?

130
00:07:09,617 --> 00:07:11,710
-Hales, tell him. -what?

131
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,322
I had to have a little talk with her about walking away, too.

132
00:07:14,332 --> 00:07:17,610
Oh, you are just full of funny today, aren't you?

133
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,461
What happened to you?

134
00:07:20,495 --> 00:07:21,962
He decked julian.

135
00:07:21,996 --> 00:07:23,330
Why?

136
00:07:23,365 --> 00:07:25,000
He was dating peyton in l.a.

137
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,190
Really?

138
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,170
Yeah, apparently they were in love.

139
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,850
Nice. sorry.

140
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,100
I just really appreciate when the drama's not about us.

141
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,842
Yeah, you guys suck right now. you know that?

142
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:37,644
All right, I'm off.

143
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:40,481
Jamie and orval are at andre's for the night.

144
00:07:40,515 --> 00:07:43,350
-Who's orval? -orval is jamie's imaginary

145
00:07:43,418 --> 00:07:45,452
Well, he's technically chester's imaginary friend,

146
00:07:45,487 --> 00:07:47,280
But jamie takes him places.

147
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,950
-Seriously?  -Yeah.

148
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,737
If orval's the worst of our worries, I think we're doing pretty good.

149
00:07:53,311 --> 00:07:55,311
Okay, wish me luck.

150
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:56,811
Good luck.

151
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,250
Mm. wish me luck, too.

152
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,654
Ugh, get out of here.

153
00:08:02,654 --> 00:08:04,367
Thanks for the ice, and,

154
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:08,125
No, actually, just thank you for the ice.

155
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:12,323
Come on, punchy. you can tell me all about it.

156
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,758
Imaginary friend.

157
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:16,893
I knew my kid would end up weird.

158
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:20,465
now, why you got to go call having an imaginary friend weird?

159
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,068
Gigi, get up.

160
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,267
Mmm. come back to bed, baby.

161
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:29,293
No. no, no, no, no. and don't call me baby.

162
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:30,550
Come on. you got to go.

163
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,550
Why? what's the problem?

164
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,670
The problem is milicent, my girlfriend,

165
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,180
Who's gonna be here any second.

166
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,161
You think she'd like to join us?

167
00:08:38,161 --> 00:08:39,492
I think she wants to kill us.

168
00:08:39,492 --> 00:08:40,830
Me. there is no "us."

169
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,160
Come on, gigi. move your ass.

170
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,252
And don't say "you'd like that"

171
00:08:43,252 --> 00:08:44,430
And don't say "i will if you watch"

172
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,859
And don't say "you first."

173
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,132
Please, you're killing me.

174
00:08:47,132 --> 00:08:48,500
Fine.

175
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,300
Man, my head hurts.

176
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,245
I can't believe I let you get me drunk

177
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,482
And take advantage of me last night.

178
00:08:59,482 --> 00:09:00,842
I didn't get you drunk.

179
00:09:00,842 --> 00:09:03,420
And I definitely did not take advantage of you.

180
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,000
Then why am I in your t-shirt?

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
You don't remember?

182
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,020
You puked all over yourself and then passed out.

183
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,300
I washed your shirt.

184
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,131
Thanks.

185
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:15,800
You're such a good guy.

186
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,457
Yeah, well, I'm gonna be a dead guy

187
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,264
If I don't get you out of here, seriously.

188
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:21,759
I'll see you at work, but...

189
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,795
I'll get your shirt.

190
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,029
Mouth...

191
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,775
Here's yours.

192
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
Oh, my god.

193
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,770
No. whatever it is, I can't deal with another store incident.

194
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,311
There was a girl in my bed.

195
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,846
Are you coming out?

196
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,715
No, it was gigi! she was in my bed!

197
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:48,086
Wait. you're a three-way With the hot high-school ex?

198
00:09:48,153 --> 00:09:49,454
Really?

199
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:52,096
Actually, marvin and gigi had a slumber party last night.

200
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:52,960
I walked in this morning

201
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,502
And found that tramp-faced whore slut bitch in my bed!

202
00:09:55,502 --> 00:09:57,996
-With mouth? -no, he was on the couch!

203
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:02,000
So, then, what's the problem?

204
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,901
Do you think he cheated?

205
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,957
Millie, you and mouth are, like, head-over-heels for each other.

206
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:10,041
Why would he want to screw that up?

207
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,350
Maybe because I don't sleep with him?

208
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,700
What?

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,650
I'm a virgin and mouth isn't

210
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,500
And I'm sure he has needs and what if he fulfilled them?

211
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Back up a second. you're a virgin?

212
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,865
You live together and you share a bed

213
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:38,100
And you are still... intact?

214
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,021
Well, you do the other stuff, though, right,

215
00:10:43,021 --> 00:10:46,400
Like, you know, the j's, "h" or "b"?

216
00:10:47,496 --> 00:10:50,465
Nothing at all?

217
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,239
It's like finding a bigfoot or a unicorn or something!

218
00:10:57,273 --> 00:10:59,500
Maybe I should just have sex with him.

219
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,400
No, no, no. it is not all about sex.

220
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,700
Trust me.

221
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,300
That boy loves you for exactly who you are.

222
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,512
You just need to go home,

223
00:11:07,512 --> 00:11:10,900
And you need to talk to him about this, okay?

224
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:16,855
Thanks, brooke.

225
00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:19,858
So, not even

226
00:11:19,893 --> 00:11:21,727
No.

227
00:11:25,832 --> 00:11:28,700
Test on one, test one two.

228
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:31,245
Hey, it is gonna get really chaotic today,

229
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:33,005
So in case I forget to say it later,

230
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:34,343
Thank you for helping me.

231
00:11:34,343 --> 00:11:35,951
Well, I got to pay you back for your wedding dress somehow.

232
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:37,560
This seems like a pretty cool way to do it.

233
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,565
Yeah, about that.

234
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,420
Tonight will pay for, like, a sleeve,

235
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,650
But as long as you don't ruin anything else, I might let you live.

236
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,915
So, can I ask you a question without getting slapped?

237
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:52,415
Depends on what the question is.

238
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:55,025
Um, brooke told me you were adopted.

239
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:57,650
I was just wondering if you ever met your birth parents.

240
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,205
Um, yeah, both of them, one pretty recently.

241
00:12:01,205 --> 00:12:02,701
That didn't turn out so great,

242
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:06,960
But, my other parents are always gonna be my real parents,you know?

243
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,182
Seems kind of greedy, though, don't you think?

244
00:12:09,182 --> 00:12:12,844
I mean, you've got like, what, four parents? I've got none.

245
00:12:12,844 --> 00:12:16,700
Well, you have brooke, and she's pretty great, right?

246
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,000
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. I mean, she's getting another baby.

247
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,316
A baby? how?

248
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:26,191
You see, when two people love each other...

249
00:12:26,258 --> 00:12:28,860
Some lady from the adoption agency called,

250
00:12:28,894 --> 00:12:30,862
Said they had a kid for her.

251
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:33,196
Hey, little sister.

252
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:36,830
Um, derek, this is sam.

253
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,330
Sam, this is my brother, derek.

254
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,885
It's a long story. we have the same father.

255
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:43,900
If you'd call him that, he's an ass.

256
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,800
Derek has issues like you do!

257
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,600
You're gonna have to let it go.

258
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,550
It's a long story, but I'll explain everything.

259
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,221
We were working late, and gigi got drunk.

260
00:12:56,221 --> 00:12:57,630
At work?

261
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,020
Well, yeah, but it was after hours.

262
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,680
You were drunk with your intern after hours?

263
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,950
It sounds worse than it was. nothing happened.

264
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,850
Gigi couldn't drive,

265
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,300
And I didn't want to look like some creepy older guy

266
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,075
Carrying a drunk coed into the dorms.

267
00:13:11,075 --> 00:13:14,300
She could have taken a cab or the couch, at least.

268
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,000
I was just being respectful.

269
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,250
I think you're paying too much respect to the wrong girl.

270
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,150
I'm sorry.

271
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,711
I swear it was innocent, millie.

272
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:25,711
You know you can trust me.

273
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:28,600
It's not you I'm worried about.

274
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,400
And I have a new rule

275
00:13:30,457 --> 00:13:33,957
Nobody except us in our bed, not ever.

276
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,164
And burn the sheets.

277
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Still here.

278
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:55,914
Why?

279
00:13:55,949 --> 00:13:57,483
How?

280
00:13:57,517 --> 00:14:00,119
Why? because you need me right now.

281
00:14:00,186 --> 00:14:03,489
How?

282
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:04,923
Well, maybe I'm in your head.

283
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:07,760
Or maybe I'm still alive.

284
00:14:10,396 --> 00:14:13,165
Nope, I'm still dead.

285
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,130
What do you want, "q"?

286
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,804
What do I want? what do you want, nate, huh?

287
00:14:18,872 --> 00:14:20,706
Ain't you got a slamball championship game to

288
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:22,541
be playing in tonight or something?

289
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:24,610
I quit.

290
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:26,845
You quit.

291
00:14:29,182 --> 00:14:31,350
Not much of a comeback.

292
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:35,921
Ooh, peyton. ah!

293
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:38,000
We just have a small problem.

294
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,840
-I can't perform tonight. -what? why?

295
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,012
Because, listen, I'm rusty and they're gonna hate me

296
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:43,100
And I'm gonna ruin the show.

297
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,400
No, no, you're not gonna ruin the show. you're gonna be great.

298
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,650
No, I am gonna ruin the show because I'm nervous

299
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,900
And I can't even remember the lines to my own song.

300
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,733
Did I just hear what I thought I heard?

301
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:55,238
Someone's a little nervous?

302
00:14:55,238 --> 00:14:57,570
Don't even start with me, you little brat.

303
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,750
Nice. is that how you talk to your students?

304
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,667
Yes.

305
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:04,080
Mia, this is sam. she's gonna be your assistant tonight.

306
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,720
So anything you want, ask her. she has a debt to pay off.

307
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,639
Hey, sam. how about we just hang, thgh?

308
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,757
I don't think I'm diva enough to have an assistant.

309
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:13,900
Hey, thank you again for being a part of all this, mia.

310
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,625
I wouldn't miss it for anything.

311
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,512
And, besides, if haley's gonna suck,

312
00:15:17,512 --> 00:15:19,400
I wouldn't miss that for anything, either.

313
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,700
You're gonna be fine, hales.

314
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,300
Besides, if you're not, who's even gonna notice?

315
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,438
Them.

316
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,810
Look at the cry out loud there, they are all waiting for you.

317
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,150
Kind of like all the people waiting for your second record, huh?

318
00:15:41,495 --> 00:15:44,100
Right. it's gonna be fine.

319
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:50,770
How's everybody doing tonight?!

320
00:15:50,837 --> 00:15:53,005
All right, that's good to hear.

321
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,676
I got to tell you  I am so excited to be here tonight,

322
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:01,056
And it's such an honor to be able to do this for my brother and his family.

323
00:16:01,056 --> 00:16:03,000
Thank you guys for having us.

324
00:16:03,684 --> 00:16:05,051
Mia, I forgot the first line of my song.

325
00:16:05,118 --> 00:16:06,519
Tell me what the first line of my song is.

326
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,61
"it's got to be this one. you don't have to fake it."

327
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:12,300
Now go get them.

328
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,263
Please give it up for the one and only haley james scott!

329
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,550
It's so weird to see my teacher being majorly cheered for.

330
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,200
Well, get used to it. your teacher's a badass.

331
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,200
Yeah, I guess.

332
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,180
So, is it fun being on the road?

333
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,450
Oh, dude, it's awesome.

334
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,650
But sometimes it's hard sleeping in a different place every night.

335
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,700
Yeah, I've done that.

336
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,350
You probably feel guilty, huh,

337
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,175
Scaring haley and jluke like that

338
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:09,500
After they let you play and all?

339
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,500
Yeah, it's probably a good thing that you quit.

340
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,512
Got anything to say about that, huh?

341
00:18:18,512 --> 00:18:19,900
Nate!

342
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm ignoring you.

343
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,922
Oh, you're ignoring me?

344
00:18:22,957 --> 00:18:25,558
You're ignoring me?

345
00:18:25,593 --> 00:18:29,029
Oh, well, let me ask you this, nate, huh?

346
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:30,630
Did you quit basketball, or did you just quit slamball?

347
00:18:30,665 --> 00:18:32,866
What do you want from me?

348
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,400
Now I'm ignoring you.

349
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,139
Great. you're ignoring me,

350
00:18:39,173 --> 00:18:41,141
But you know that'll only work for about a minute,

351
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,800
And then you're gonna crack a smile.

352
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,100
What do you want from me? I'm busy.

353
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,579
I need to talk to lucas.

354
00:18:46,614 --> 00:18:49,400
Okay, you should do that, then.

355
00:19:17,677 --> 00:19:19,979
Hey, brooke. good show, huh?

356
00:19:20,013 --> 00:19:21,800
Oh, I might just be in heaven.

357
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,249
There are hot men in uniform everywhere I look,

358
00:19:23,283 --> 00:19:26,952
And I am the proud owner of a happy teen.

359
00:19:28,588 --> 00:19:29,922
Hey, let me ask you something.

360
00:19:29,956 --> 00:19:33,450
Has peyton ever mentioned this julian guy?

361
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,150
Here we go.

362
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,150
P. sawyer finally told you.

363
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,125
You knew.

364
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,983
Only because she didn't know how to tell you.

365
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:42,850
I was just the practice dummy.

366
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,238
She knew how excited you were about the movie,

367
00:19:46,273 --> 00:19:48,541
And she didn't want to ruin this for you.

368
00:19:48,575 --> 00:19:51,243
By the way, you are not allowed to be mad.

369
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:52,878
Really? I'm not allowed to be mad

370
00:19:52,913 --> 00:19:54,950
That she hooked up with this guy right after we broke up?

371
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,050
It was not right after. and seriously?

372
00:19:58,085 --> 00:19:59,800
You tried to hook up with me

373
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,600
The night after you guys broke up.

374
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,500
I would never tell peyton that,

375
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,259
But, lucas, you almost married lindsey.

376
00:20:07,294 --> 00:20:09,962
Julian was just a rebound.

377
00:20:09,996 --> 00:20:12,362
Do girls fall in love with rebounds?

378
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:14,801
Every time. but it's not real love.

379
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,869
Your head tricks you into it to protect you

380
00:20:16,903 --> 00:20:19,472
From the crushing pain your heart is putting you through.

381
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:24,110
So, go. kiss it out. it's gonna be fine.

382
00:20:28,115 --> 00:20:29,900
I would

383
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,185
If I could squeeze in between her and rebound guy.

384
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,150
all right you guys.

385
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,120
I am a huge fan of the next actress we have

386
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,780
She is young. she is very, very hot.

387
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,050
Hear that? "young."

388
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,890
Hey, I think I saw jason out there.

389
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,260
She has a huge voice.

390
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,890
Please give it up for mia catalano.

391
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,210
Hey, guys.

392
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,630
I just wanted to mention that I'm single.

393
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,570
Just throwing that out there.

394
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,840
You were great!

395
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,910
Oh, my gosh! it's so good to see you!

396
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,450
You going on tour anytime soon?

397
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,030
Oh, no, no tour for me, not since I had my baby boy.

398
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,020
Must have been a tough decision for you.

399
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,440
No, not really.

400
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,910
It's exciting, the cheers from the crowd,

401
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,280
But they can't take the place of my family.

402
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,000
That's what I want the most.

403
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,390
Well, your son's lucky to have a mom

404
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,330
That chose him over her career.

405
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,900
I wasn't so lucky.

406
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,730
Yeah. I'm sorry.

407
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,200
We all make different choices,

408
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,000
And different things.

409
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,140
I think eventually we learn

410
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,510
To define happiness for ourselves on our own terms,

411
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,310
In spite of the pain other people have caused us.

412
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,290
Thanks for last night, mouth.

413
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,860
I'm really sorry I got so wasted.

414
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,900
We could have slept in the same bed, though.

415
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,570
I wouldn't have attacked you or anything.

416
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,740
I don't think millie would have been

417
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,970
Okay with us sleeping in the same bed.

418
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,300
But you would have been okay with it?

419
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,610
That's not what I meant.

420
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,170
I wouldn't be okay with it

421
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,680
Because millie wouldn't be okay with it.

422
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,340
So if millie were okay with it, then --

423
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,150
Let's just finish the piece,

424
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,980
And I think we need to be a little more professional.

425
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,880
You're kind of hot when you're mad.

426
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,000
You must be julian.

427
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,400
Brooke davis, I've read all about you.

428
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,500
Good. then you know being the third person

429
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,820
In a lucas/peyton love triangle usually doesn't end well.

430
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,990
For who?

431
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,760
I think it's pretty clear in the book

432
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,990
If you're not lucas or peyton you should just forget it.

433
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:32,300
And just so you know, they are two of my best friends.

434
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:35,630
So if you mess with them, I will mess with you.

435
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:38,870
that sounds like fun.

436
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,670
Don't you have a blackberry coma to fall into?

437
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,070
I love a feisty peyton.

438
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,310
Do me a favor.

439
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,540
Stop flirting with my best friend.

440
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,850
I think she's jealous.

441
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,000
Come on, brooke.

442
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,500
We have to announce a band.

443
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,000
We do?

444
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,320
you're right.

445
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,820
We have a band to announce.

446
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,280
watch this play right here.

447
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,350
He's about to throw an alley-oop to the dude right behind the line.

448
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,790
Called it!

449
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,020
You know, you're kind of ruing the game.

450
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,760
Come on, man. you knew that was gonna happen.

451
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,160
I just said it out loud. ooh!

452
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,030
I'm calling it quits

453
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:45,740
Because I don't want to end up back in that wheelchair,all right?

454
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,970
I won't do that to haley and jamie again.

455
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,540
So you're quitting for haley and jamie.

456
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,950
Sure, that ma-- if that's your excuse.

457
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,220
Look, I worked hard.

458
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,220
And my dream started to come true again, 

459
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:10,190
And I started to believe that people just go through things,

460
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,930
Challenges that make them stronger.

461
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,600
And then you were gone.

462
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,870
All right, I showed up at that river court,

463
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,970
And you never came.

464
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,370
And that was it, just like that.

465
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:24,810
And I realized that -- that we're not invincible.

466
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,210
Dreams die.

467
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,950
So what?

468
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,220
What you gonna do, nate?

469
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,890
Sit here on this couch and watch ball on tv, afraid to live?!

470
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
That's what you're gonna do?!

471
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,720
That really pisses me off, nate.

472
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,030
You know why?

473
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,460
'cause you got a second chance, man.

474
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,270
You did.

475
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,900
I wish I did.

476
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,720
How's the hand?

477
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:18,160
I figured if you knew I had a history with peyton

478
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,860
You wouldn't work with me.

479
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,970
Look, I believe in the book. I want to make the movie.

480
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,840
I'm not interested.

481
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,710
Come on, luke. it's gonna be great.

482
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,840
There's not gonna be a movie.

483
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:39,950
Well, at the risk of getting punched again,

484
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,820
I own the option to the book.

485
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:46,560
So it's happening... with or without you.

486
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,340
Hey, everybody, this is my friend brooke.

487
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,200
She was begging me to come out and say hi to you guys.

488
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:07,010
Hi, boys. it's an honor to be here.

489
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:11,420
We just want to thank you guys so much for everything.

490
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,880
We appreciate all that you do,

491
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,000
And we appreciate every single one of you.

492
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,500
You guys are the real rock stars.

493
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,500
So, thank you very, very much.

494
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,840
So, without further ado, let's give it up for...

495
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,740
angels & airwaves!

496
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:47,400
So, word is you're getting a baby.

497
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,000
She's scared, you know.

498
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,800
What do you mean?

499
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,250
She told me about the phone call from the adoption agency.

500
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,000
You should talk to her about it.

501
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,970
I'm pretty sure she thinks her days with you are numbered.

502
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,350
Here at slamball, as the slashers

503
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,280
Take home the 2008 slamball title

504
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,900
By knocking --

505
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,000
Guess they didn't need me after all.

506
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,620
Yeah, I guess you didn't need them, either.

507
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,730
You know, there's more to life than basketball.

508
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,100
Oh, is that right?

509
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:06,140
Every time I get to see jamie laugh,

510
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:09,200
I mean, that's a dream come true.

511
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:14,040
Every time I get to hold haley, it's a dream come true.

512
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,550
They're my life.

513
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,800
And you owe it to them

514
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,200
To be the very best version of yourself, man,

515
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,800
The version where you fight for what you want,

516
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:27,190
The version where you're not afraid to be great.

517
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,000
You're better for them when you're living your dreams, man.

518
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:34,800
And there is nothing -- nothing selfish about that.

519
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,800
Hey. millie, right?

520
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,900
Mouth's not here right now.

521
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,840
I know. I'm here to see you.

522
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,640
What's up?

523
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,800
I know you had some sort

524
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,640
Of high-school puppy-love thing with marvin,

525
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,000
But you need to back off.

526
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,670
I don't know what you're talking about.

527
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:13,030
I think you do And I don't trust you or like you.

528
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,490
So how about you stay out of my bed

529
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,600
And stay away from marvin?

530
00:31:35,584 --> 00:31:38,152
Hey. awesome.

531
00:31:38,186 --> 00:31:40,900
Um, can I borrow you for a second?

532
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:49,870
Look, I want to talk to you

533
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,490
About the message from this morning about the baby.

534
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,510
It's none of my business.

535
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:56,722
It is absolutely your business, sam.

536
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,151
Look, I get it, okay?

537
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,560
Everyone wants the puppy, not the mutt.

538
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,400
It's happened before. I know what happens next.

539
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,837
You get the baby, I go back to the pound.

540
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,777
You are not going back to the pound.

541
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,782
I don't ever want you to feel threatened or afraid

542
00:32:18,782 --> 00:32:21,400
That I'm gonna ask you to leave.

543
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,257
My home is your home now, sam,

544
00:32:26,324 --> 00:32:29,660
And it's gonna be that way as long as you want it to be.

545
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,718
I'm sorry.

546
00:33:06,924 --> 00:33:08,925
Did julian talk to you?

547
00:33:10,861 --> 00:33:12,361
And?

548
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,324
I'm not gonna do the movie.

549
00:33:14,324 --> 00:33:15,300
What?

550
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,400
He's gonna make it anyway.

551
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,636
No, he can't. he can't do that without you.

552
00:33:19,636 --> 00:33:21,444
I signed the rights over to him.

553
00:33:21,444 --> 00:33:23,161
He can do whatever he wants with it.

554
00:33:23,161 --> 00:33:26,350
Luke, he can't just take it away from you.

555
00:33:26,384 --> 00:33:30,354
Look, peyton, I don't want to work with him, okay?

556
00:33:30,388 --> 00:33:33,023
I don't trust the guy.

557
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,500
I just want him out of our lives.

558
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,460
This is my fault.

559
00:33:36,494 --> 00:33:38,962
I should have just told you right away.

560
00:33:38,997 --> 00:33:39,650
Look, it's okay

561
00:33:39,879 --> 00:33:42,466
There will be other books, other movies.

562
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,801
Yeah, but --

563
00:33:43,868 --> 00:33:44,902
It's okay.

564
00:33:44,936 --> 00:33:47,871
It's okay.

565
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,025
hey,big brother,what do you think?

566
00:34:04,026 --> 00:34:06,661
I think it couldn't have been better. Thank you, peyton.

567
00:34:06,661 --> 00:34:09,400
Oh, my god, it was nothing. I'm happy I could do it.

568
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:14,269
It means a lot to the marines...and to me.

569
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,639
And it -- it made me realize

570
00:34:17,673 --> 00:34:20,480
I've wasted too much time being upset

571
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,100
About the family I didn't have.

572
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,312
I need to spend more time

573
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,380
Being thankful for the family I do have.

574
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,319
Feels kind of good to let it go, doesn't it?

575
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:37,815
Hey, thanks for letting me hang out with you all night.

576
00:34:37,815 --> 00:34:39,315
It was way cool.

577
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,588
Um, not to be lame or anything,

578
00:34:41,588 --> 00:34:43,984
But can I get your autograph?

579
00:34:43,984 --> 00:34:44,984
Sure!

580
00:34:44,984 --> 00:34:48,146
How about I give you my number instead?

581
00:34:48,146 --> 00:34:50,310
Call me sometime, and we'll hang out.

582
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,581
Really?

583
00:34:51,581 --> 00:34:52,686
Yeah.

584
00:34:52,686 --> 00:34:54,275
Peyton and haley and brooke are really cool,

585
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,644
But they're kind of boring.

586
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,651
I thought I'd head home.

587
00:35:03,651 --> 00:35:05,308
Sure, that's fine.

588
00:35:05,308 --> 00:35:07,400
You think you could walk me to my car?

589
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,403
I'm not hitting on you.

590
00:35:09,405 --> 00:35:12,507
It's dark and they never found out who killed quentin fields

591
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,858
And it creeps me out.

592
00:35:14,892 --> 00:35:17,928
Okay.

593
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,815
This is me.

594
00:35:24,815 --> 00:35:27,100
Sorry to be such a girl.

595
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,782
Ah, no problem. drive safe.

596
00:35:28,782 --> 00:35:30,082
Mouth?

597
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,440
I don't want to cause any trouble with you and your girlfriend.

598
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,171
I'll try to be better about it.

599
00:35:37,206 --> 00:35:38,706
I appreciate that.

600
00:35:49,651 --> 00:35:51,650
Oh, hey. thank you very much.

601
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,760
Peyton, can I talk to you?

602
00:35:54,762 --> 00:35:56,390
Oh, you have a lot of nerve.

603
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,080
You show up in tree hill unannounced,

604
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,600
You get lucas to sign his book over,

605
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,563
And then you tell him you're gonna make the movie without him?

606
00:36:01,597 --> 00:36:03,335
Okay, that's not exactly what happened.

607
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,314
I apologized to lucas and told him I wanted him on the movie.

608
00:36:06,314 --> 00:36:08,352
He said he didn't want any part of it,

609
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,700
And I even let him punch me.

610
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,400
He punched you?

611
00:36:15,024 --> 00:36:18,163
Look, the point is, I believe in this book,

612
00:36:18,163 --> 00:36:20,177
And I want to make this movie.

613
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:22,416
And, yes, I told him that I could do it without him,

614
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:25,620
But the truth is, I need him to help me tell this story.

615
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,315
That's all I want, nothing else.

616
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,516
You're lying.

617
00:36:28,584 --> 00:36:30,986
No, I'm not, and you know I'm not.

618
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,000
This is business, peyton.

619
00:36:33,723 --> 00:36:35,790
You need to convince lucas to do the movie.

620
00:36:35,858 --> 00:36:38,259
And you'll make it the movie he wants it to be.

621
00:36:38,259 --> 00:36:39,326
Absolutely.

622
00:36:39,326 --> 00:36:41,732
'cause if I convince him to do this And you are lying, I swear

623
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:43,680
I give you my word.

624
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,371
I'll talk to him.

625
00:36:58,274 --> 00:37:00,200
What is all this?

626
00:37:00,547 --> 00:37:01,650
Oh, my goodness.

627
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:04,386
And please tell me you didn't move the furniture by yourself.

628
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,042
My back is fine.

629
00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:08,200
How'd you do today?

630
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,025
I loved it.

631
00:37:10,942 --> 00:37:12,565
I was so scared at first,

632
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:15,863
And then...it just started to feel right.

633
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,780
I felt alive. it was awesome.

634
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:22,319
I'm so bummed that I didn't get to see you.

635
00:37:22,354 --> 00:37:24,655
I know. me too, baby.

636
00:37:24,689 --> 00:37:27,258
If you're not too tired, I was hoping for an encore.

637
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:30,060
I would love that.

638
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:37,853
Haley

639
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:43,859
let's promise never to be too scared to live our dreams.

640
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,363
I promise.

641
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,500
Me too.

642
00:38:14,524 --> 00:38:16,692
Hi, patricia. it's brooke davis.

643
00:38:16,693 --> 00:38:18,360
I'm calling regarding your message.

644
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,350
Yes, I am definitely interested,

645
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:24,750
And I just wanted you to know That I'm currently fostering a teenager,

646
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,403
And it's going great, so

647
00:38:29,237 --> 00:38:31,171
Uh, no.

648
00:38:31,206 --> 00:38:35,509
No, I didn't realize that would complicate things.

649
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,815
You punched julian.

650
00:38:56,849 --> 00:38:58,383
Yeah.

651
00:38:58,417 --> 00:39:00,885
That was me not being jealous.

652
00:39:01,553 --> 00:39:03,822
Okay.

653
00:39:03,856 --> 00:39:05,423
"okay"?

654
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,393
I'm happy you got jealous.

655
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,428
Really?

656
00:39:12,295 --> 00:39:14,560
But even though I'm happy,

657
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,975
I do think you should do the movie.

658
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,050
I think you're gonna regret

659
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,949
Seeing it made without you, luke,

660
00:39:22,783 --> 00:39:25,000
And it's your story to tell.

661
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:29,123
And julian doesn't think the movie can get made without you.

662
00:39:29,157 --> 00:39:30,825
I agree.

663
00:39:32,354 --> 00:39:34,020
You talked to julian?

664
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,755
Look, you can punch him in the face anytime you want, okay?

665
00:39:38,188 --> 00:39:41,330
But I don't want you to walk away from this

666
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,110
For the wrong reasons.

667
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:45,915
I don't want you to have any regrets.

668
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:54,682
You know... it's hard for me to know

669
00:39:54,716 --> 00:39:56,817
That you were in love with this guy.

670
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:02,314
But you have been so strong and so good to me

671
00:40:03,494 --> 00:40:05,860
When I've strayed from us.

672
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,805
So I'm gonna try to let go of it, okay?

673
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:17,665
Besides, who wouldn't fall in love with you, peyton sawyer?

674
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,192
I really enjoyed the encore.

675
00:40:30,192 --> 00:40:31,287
Oh, good.

676
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,900
I think you're going to enjoy the encore to the encore

677
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,177
I'm proud of you, haley.

678
00:40:47,652 --> 00:40:49,753
Oh, geez!

679
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,700
You got to stop doing that, "q."

680
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,326
You scared the crap out of me.

681
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:56,000
Dude, you scared the crap out of you. I'm dead.

682
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,800
I know you are.

683
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,399
I miss you, "q."

684
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,191
Nate, that's all right.You just focus on the comeback

685
00:41:05,191 --> 00:41:08,870
And I'll be there every step of the way.

686
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,600
Oh, and, nate...

687
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,400
That phone is gonna ring someday.

688
00:41:17,749 --> 00:41:18,700
Live the life.

689
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,800
Live the dream.

690
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,300
No fear.

691
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
No fear.
