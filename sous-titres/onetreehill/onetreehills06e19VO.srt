1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,910
previously on "one tree hill"...

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,440
I could have sent that to you.

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,500
I came to get my car.

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,020
I'm driving it back.

5
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,390
I guess this is goodbye
for a while,then.

6
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,970
Actually,it's goodbye forever.

7
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,650
I think we should
end this -- us.

8
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,590
You deserve more than this.

9
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,010
You'll address your literature class

10
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,820
and explain that you were wrong.

11
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,250
And if I don't?

12
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,440
You'll be fired.

13
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,750
I should probably say goodbye.

14
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,220
I'm glad you're here.

15
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,230
I said I loved
you,and you didn't say it back.

16
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,040
And I said it was fine,but it wasn'T.

17
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,080
I don't want you to go.

18
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,050
But I have to.

19
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,880
If continuing this pregnancy
means I lose you,then we end it.

20
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,190
I'm having this baby.

21
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,310
We're having this baby.

25
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,880
- Up and at 'em.
- What?

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,610
It's a beautiful day --
you,me,jamie,the river court.

27
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,780
Come on. Let's go,chop-chop.

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,010
I thought I'd go shoot a
round with nate and jamie.

29
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,320
Think you'll be okay?

30
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,340
Honey,you don't have to check
up on me every five minutes,

31
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,110
even though I do love you for it.

32
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,570
I know.

33
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,990
I guess it's just 'cause,well,I'm
the only one who knows.

34
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,080
I know. I know.

35
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,350
I should tell brooke -- the
whole "no secrets" thing.

36
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,790
Maybe I will.

37
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,080
You go play.

38
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,930
Okay.

39
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,350
I love you.

40
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,080
Yeah,I sort of like you,too.

41
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,420
It's kind of quiet in here.

42
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,100
Yeah,mia had a couple of
gigs left on the schedule,

43
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,870
but the label really
loves that new song I sent.

44
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,150
Another one?

45
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,300
Geez,that's girl's
been a writing machine

46
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,580
since she hooked up with chase.

47
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,090
True,but the song
they're really crazy about

48
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,770
is "feel this" by haley james scott.

49
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,840
- Dude,you totally thudded me!
- Right.

50
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,460
I'm sorry. I didn't know I wasn't
supposed to be promoting your career.

51
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,490
Well,it depends on what they said.

52
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,510
Uh,they said...

53
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,950
they want more.

54
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,510
And they're really excited
about the new promotional angle.

55
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,120
Which is what,exactly?

56
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,110
The singing maverick teacher

57
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,120
that punched out the principal
and slept with a student.

58
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,600
I never hit anyone.

59
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,860
And that other thing
was seven years ago.

60
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,900
I was a tutor.

61
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,010
Oh,okay.

62
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,710
Sorry,I had to stretch it a little bit.

63
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,470
How's the new stuff coming?

64
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,310
Why?

65
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,340
'Cause I keep thinking I should
be in third-period english

66
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,940
and wondering how my kids are doing.

67
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,120
* I keep thinking of you *

68
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,850
congratulations.

69
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,280
You set a new record for failing.

70
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,030
We didn't fail. You failed.
Bring back miss scott.

71
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,740
You -- detention
in my office,um...

72
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,780
here's how little you know
-- I'm not even in this class.

73
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,680
You shouldn't be,either.

74
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,930
Anyone else?

75
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,070
He's got a point.

76
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,040
Maybe we wouldn't be failing
if you hadn't fired our teacher.

77
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,730
Watch it,or you'll be joining
your friend,mr.No-name.

78
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,140
All I'm saying is that either
we all got instantly dumber,

79
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,830
or you should have been
a little bit smarter.

80
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,010
I'll see myself out.

81
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,350
We need to teach rimkus a lesson.

82
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,640
And just to be clear,by "lesson,"

83
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,300
I don't mean throw on a ski mask
and beat the crap out of her.

84
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,470
pack a bag. We taking a road trip.

85
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,400
I'm sleeping.

86
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,660
No,what you're doing is
feeling sorry for yourself

87
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,230
because your girl broke up with you,

88
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,520
because I've been
doing me de saamn thing.

89
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,580
Now pack that bag.

90
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,840
Dude,I'm sleeping.

91
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,140
You can sleep in the car.

92
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,910
Now,you want to ask where we going?

93
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,340
Where are we goi?

94
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,460
To fix your broken heart.

95
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,800
Now move your
feeling-sorry-for-yourself ass.

96
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,160
- Let's go.
- Hey,man!

97
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,570
- Let's go!
- No!

98
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,450
* I've been thinking of you a lot *

99
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,130
nice!

100
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,640
All right,now go in for a lay-up.

101
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,210
Piece of cake.

102
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,430
- Nice!
- Nice.

103
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,050
Kid's growing up fast.

104
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,620
Tell me about it.

105
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,190
He's been asking a lot
of questions lately.

106
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,440
All of a sudden we're
supposed to be the grown-ups

107
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,960
that have all the answers.

108
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,200
Birds and the bees already?

109
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,880
That would be easier.

110
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,240
No,they're actually,um
-- they're about keith.

111
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,400
Ever since dan admitted to
jamie that he killed keith,

112
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,320
join the club.

113
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,260
Actually,I was thinking
maybe you could help.

114
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,710
He feels bad he never got to meet keith.

115
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,890
You knew him better than anybody.

116
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,740
I thought maybe you could talk to him.

117
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,100
You know what,I've got a better idea.

118
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,820
Did you come to say goodbye?

119
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,870
Well,I was thinking maybe
this didn't have to be goodbye.

120
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,540
What does that mean?

121
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,080
You said you didn't
want to be a footnote

122
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,590
in someone else's love story.

123
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,960
Well,maybe it's time we
write our own epic love story.

124
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,980
This time tomorrow,we could be
walking on a beach in malibu.

125
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,750
But what about sam?

126
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,330
I can't leave her here.

127
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,890
Yeah,I thought you'd say that.

128
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,620
And I agree.

129
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,330
Julian.

130
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,060
Look,I know you're gonna come up

131
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,840
with a million reasons
why you shouldn'T.

132
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,400
So I'm just gonna give you
this one why you should.

133
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,630
I love you...

134
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,570
brooke davis.

135
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,720
Come with me.

136
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,480
* You're on my mind *

137
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,060
guess what.

138
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,630
Your ex-boyfriend just asked
sam and i to go with him to L.A.

139
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,090
Tonight.

140
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,010
Jake?

141
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,870
This isn't funny.

142
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,740
I mean,that's a really big deal.

143
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,330
It is good,though,right?

144
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,550
No. It would be
ridiculous to go with him.

145
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,290
I -- I have a
store to fill.

146
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,820
My friends are here. My life is here.

147
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,840
And what about sam?

148
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,630
You know,my parents did the same
thing to me when I was in high sool.

149
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,180
When they left,I was
going out with lucas.

150
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,300
And now he's the father of your baby.

151
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,020
And you're pregnant,and
I'm your maid of honor.

152
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,390
How could I leave you?

153
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,230
Brooke,I'm gonna be fine,okay?

154
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,980
You should go.

155
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,170
We came back here for
each other,P.Sawyer.

156
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,280
Hon,no.

157
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,370
You came back here for
me,and I love you for that.

158
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,730
But I want you to be happy!

159
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,750
This is what you want,right?

160
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,240
I want more time to
figure out what I want.

161
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,070
Do you remember how
unhappy you were in L.A.?

162
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,300
Well,yeah,'cause I was alone,

163
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,750
because the boy that I loved

164
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,410
asked me to be with him,and I said no.

165
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,080
So just think about that,all right?

166
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,820
And whatever you decide to do,I
want you to know I love you.

167
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,370
And what if it doesn't work out?

168
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,570
What if it does?

169
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,410
where are we?

170
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,230
When I was your age,jamie,

171
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,450
this used to be my favorite
place in the whole world.

172
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,160
Why?

173
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,580
Well,this is your
great-uncle keith's auto shop.

174
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,690
Well,the guy that
owns it now --

175
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,220
he gave me a key so I
can come whenever I want.

176
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,270
Cool.

177
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,630
Hey,whoa,uh,be careful.

178
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,130
This was a great idea,luke.

179
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,410
Yeah,well,the mustang
needs a tune-up anyway.

180
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,980
All right,I'll pull it in.

181
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,610
Hey,nate,uh,I wanted to ask you...

182
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,150
when haley was pregnant,

183
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,460
did you ever worry about all
the things that could go wrong?

184
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,920
Of course.

185
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,350
Just Stay off the internet.

186
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,990
It's full of horror stories.

187
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,510
Haley oked up one of
her symptoms one time

188
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,910
and was convinced jamiwas
gonna be born with two heads.

189
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,830
You know what the doctor told us?

190
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,440
Childbirth is the ordinary miracle.

191
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,570
You can't believe it happens every day.

192
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,770
Jamie,do you want to help
me pull the mustang in?

193
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,340
- Cool. Are we gonna work on it?
- Of course.

194
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,170
- Can I help?
- Yeah,come on.

195
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,490
Sweet!

196
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,170
hey. Did you get one of those for me?

197
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,770
Thanks. I need it.

198
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,630
I've been so exhausted lately.

199
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,470
Yeah,that's 'cause
you've been depressed.

200
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,650
But tonight,all that's
gonna change,my brother.

201
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,810
Tonight,no
sleeping --

202
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,440
well,unless sleeping
with horny coeds counts.

203
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,590
Big college party tonight,baby.

204
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,390
- What college?
- Your alma mater.

205
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,490
What? Skills,gigi goes there.

206
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,530
I know

207
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,670
You just texted her and told
her you was rolling through.

208
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,680
No,I didn'T.

209
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,070
And she texted you back and said
how excited she was to see you.

210
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,520
Dude,where's my phone?

211
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,300
Bam!

212
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,160
"Your ass is so fine"?

213
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,570
Thank you.

214
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,680
No,I mean you texted that to her?

215
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,120
It's all good,man. She liked it.

216
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,850
Gigi's the reason I lost
millie in the first place.

217
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,180
No,you're the reason you lost
millie in the first place.

218
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,520
Now it's time for you to have some
wild-ass,no-strings-attached sex.

219
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,180
And gigi is the one for that.

220
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,690
Turn the car around.

221
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,210
Mouth,look.

222
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,560
You're not the only one
that needed this trip.

223
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,590
Do it for me,okay?

224
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,910
The second you want to bounce,I
promise,we out of there.

225
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,490
"You dirty little freak"?

226
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,580
That one came from her.

227
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,080
Sam,jack,what are you guys doing here?

228
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,180
Oh,we wanted to see you.

229
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,330
How did you get in?

230
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,470
I'm good with windows.

231
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,440
Why aren't you guys in school?

232
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,920
Rimkus kicked us out.

233
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,000
Sorry,but I can't have two students
in my house during school hours.

234
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,460
Good,'cause it's not just us two.

235
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,080
okay,so,does anybody want to tell me

236
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,050
why an entire
english-literature class is

237
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,370
in my "I wish you would have called so
I could straighten up first" living room?

238
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,300
You ever see"dead poets society"?

239
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,920
Oh,my god,who died?

240
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,990
We took a stand for a
popular teacher -- you.

241
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,650
You guys,I'm really touched,but
principal rimkus is gonna lose her mind

242
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,800
if you don't get your butts
back behind those desks.

243
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,160
We're not learning anything there.

244
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,310
She just she just handed
back our papers on "catch-22,"

245
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,060
and we all got d's and f'S.

246
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,600
We want you back.

247
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,740
I feel your pain. I really do.

248
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,780
But just think about
it from her perspective.

249
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,340
Walking out on her isn't gonna
make her respect you any more.

250
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,450
Who cares?

251
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,190
I mean,nobody likes her.

252
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,150
She doesn't even know our
names,and she's a total bitch.

253
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,510
Hey,watch your language in my...

254
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,580
house,missy.

255
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,520
- Listen,I really appreciate you guys' initiative and your heart.
- Thank you.

256
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,950
But this is not the right thing to do.

257
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,740
You have to go back to school.

258
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,870
We all know rimkus screwed
you,and she's wrong.

259
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:09,550
I mean,look at the
difference you made for me...

260
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,960
for quentin?

261
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,750
Sam,a teacher doesn't have to be your
friend or even somebody that you like.

262
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,930
In fact,out in the real world,

263
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,710
you meet a lot of people that
you're gonna disagree with,

264
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,600
and you have to learn to work with them.

265
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,130
Okay,um...

266
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,600
how about we disagree with you
and you learn to work with us?

267
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,860
Because we're not leaving here
until you teach us something.

268
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,530
Man,I miss school.

269
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,100
I see why,too.

270
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,980
What's up,little mama?

271
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,400
Ooh,look at this one. What's up,silky?

272
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,960
Hey,yo,I'm gonna holler at you later.

273
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,270
I got you.

274
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,280
Hey,look,man,I'm about
to go fix my broken heart.

275
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,910
I suggest you do the same.

276
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,510
- You seen gigi around here anywhere?
- Yep.

277
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,440
... 28,29,30!

278
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,320
Mouth!

279
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,450
- Oh,I loved your texts.
- Hey.

280
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,530
We got to do a keg stand!

281
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,270
Gigi,it's still light outside.

282
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,420
I know,but not for long. Bottoms up.

283
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,500
1,2...

284
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,130
3,4...

285
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,470
let's go,mouth! You got this,baby!

286
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,440
Got it!

287
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,500
All right.

288
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,180
There you go. Good job,jamie.

289
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,810
- All right.
- This is fun.

290
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,900
Plus,if you can fix cars,

291
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,970
you're gonna score major points
with the ladies,like miss lauren.

292
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,530
I thought we weren't
gonna talk about that.

293
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,450
Oh,that's right. I'm
sorry. You moved on.

294
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,880
What's the,uh -- what's the
piano girl's name -- madison?

295
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,580
Dad.

296
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,510
You know,jamie,it's okay.

297
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,140
My uncle keith used to tease
me all the time about peyton.

298
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,520
Really? Why?

299
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,920
Well,it's just what guys do
when they work on cars together.

300
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,520
They tease each other
about girls,you know?

301
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,570
It's like your dad here.

302
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,370
You know,he had to trick your mom into
liking him by pretending he needed tutoring.

303
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,550
I wasn't pretending.

304
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,950
I was dumb as a post,jamie.

305
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,820
Hey,whatever happened to aunt lindsey?

306
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,890
Put the spark plug back in,you goof.

307
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,260
All right,buddy,you ready? One,two...

308
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,130
three!

309
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,020
I...there!

310
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,410
Come on,boys.

311
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,120
Drink up,baby.

312
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,380
Okay,sexy city.

313
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,990
That's yours.

314
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,030
Drink it!

315
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,310
Having fun,marvin?

316
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,700
So,next we have orr.

317
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,070
Now,how would you
describe this character?

318
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,550
Anyone.

319
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,050
Jack.

320
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,500
Uhwell,he's always
trying to crash his plane.

321
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,370
Um,it makes him seem kind of
stupid or nuts or suicidal.

322
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,140
But is he?

323
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,620
No,he's,uh,working on a plan to escape.

324
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,830
Which means?

325
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,410
He's the smartest,the least crazy.

326
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,150
Yes! That's it!

327
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,410
Did you read the book?

328
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,730
Saw the movie.

329
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,440
So,do we see how this
relates to our theme now?

330
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:51,040
Yeah,catch-22 -- it's another contradiction
on how messed up the world can be.

331
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,760
If rimkus had made it this interesting,we
wouldn't have all gotten f'S.

332
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,750
You think?

333
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,940
It's open.

334
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,650
Did you come by to beg me to stay?

335
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,360
Brooke said you asked her to go to L.A.

336
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,930
Did she?

337
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,500
I really hope you're serious,

338
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,040
because she hasn't been serious
about anybody in a long time.

339
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,250
You haven't trusted me
since the day I came to town.

340
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,240
Because you looked like
you had an ax to grind.

341
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,600
Maybe I did.

342
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,430
But somewhere along the
line,this place changed me.

343
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,370
Brooke changed me.

344
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,510
I told brooke I love her because I do.

345
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,780
I invited sam because I
want us to be a family.

346
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,930
I wouldn't have it any other way.

347
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,820
All right.

348
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,520
For the record,I do believe you.

349
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,990
So...

350
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,020
I hope it works out.

351
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,600
Thank you.

352
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,680
Wait,she didn't happen to mention
which way she's leaning,by any chance?

353
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,040
No.

354
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,840
No,she's not going,or,no,she
didn't mention it?

355
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,830
I really have no idea
what she's gonna say.

356
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,230
But I do know this
-- if brooke says no,

357
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:14,020
it won't be because she
doesn't care for you.

358
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,560
She has been very protective
of her heart for a long time.

359
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,640
She's afraid.

360
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,300
L.A.?

361
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,790
- That was fast.
- I know. It's crazy,right?

362
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,510
Maybe,maybe not.

363
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,420
I guess that means
owen's out of the picture?

364
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,530
Uh,owen had a problem with sam.

365
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,100
Or maybe you just didn't let him in.

366
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,810
So he let himself into my assistant?

367
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,810
You know,when you left for new
york,sometimes I wish I'd gone after you.

368
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,740
So you're saying I should go?

369
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,170
I don't know.

370
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,050
I mean,I didn't go.

371
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,030
And eventually I found
mia,and she's been great.

372
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,570
So you're saying I should stay.

373
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,890
I guess I'm trying to say you'll
always be able to find someone,brooke.

374
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,760
- I mean,come on. Look at you.
- Thank you.

375
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,060
But you remind me of
that springsteen line --

376
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,160
"there were ghosts in the eyes
of all the boys you sent away.

377
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,170
" Figure out what you want,brooke.

378
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:21,500
But until you let someone
in,you'll always be alone.

379
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,510
****missing****

380
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,440
****missing**** english lit.

381
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,470
I saw the mass exodus pass my window.

382
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,730
Back to school now.

383
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,320
You can't suspend us all.

384
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,410
No,but we can start with
you,mr.Daniels. Who's next?

385
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,270
Okay,can I speak with
you in my kitchen,please?

386
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,790
Uh,I realize I'm probably in
no position to give you advice.

387
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,980
Last I checked,you
had no position at all.

388
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,260
See? That's --
that's it right there,

389
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,400
the way that you speak to me
and the way you speak to them.

390
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,600
These are not third-graders.

391
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,710
They're young adults.

392
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,730
And?

393
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,860
And you have to treat them that way.

394
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,010
If you give them a class they want
to be in,they will come to you.

395
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:17,210
Okay,you guys,third-period
english lit is over.

396
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,060
I'm serious,and it's
not in my dining room.

397
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,840
It's back at school.

398
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,050
Tomorrow,I expect all of you to be
back in principal rimkus' classroom.

399
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,810
It's the right thing
to do,and you know it.

400
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,780
You left some things in my classroom.

401
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,570
I'd like them gone
by the end of the day.

402
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,290
man,marvin mcfadden,you disappoint me.

403
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,600
College
girls -- good.

404
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,880
Alcohol
-- good.

405
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,600
Pajamas
-- good.

406
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,490
Where the hell is your head at?

407
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,840
so, jack, this wasn't
your worst idea ever.

408
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,050
Kids always like an
excuse to blow off school.

409
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,920
Yes, but it was still a nice thing
you did for me, and I appreciate it.

410
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,180
Eh, you know.

411
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,880
Well, it's just payback.

412
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,920
I mean, you took the
fall when I shoplifted.

413
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,710
Thank you.

414
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,210
Yeah.

415
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,670
You, too.

416
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:47,870
Okay, you two, thank you so much
for staying behind and cleaning up,

417
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,980
but you have to go back to school, also.

418
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,210
Not me.

419
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,890
I'm suspended.

420
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,660
Go!

421
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,070
bye,miss scott.

422
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,800
hey,uncle lucas,who am I?

423
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,940
Wow,it's mini keith.

424
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,930
Uncle keith must have been so cool.

425
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:22,430
Yeah,well,not just fohis
unique sense of style.

426
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,370
Come here.

427
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:30,280
You know,your great-uncle
keith was the best guy I knew.

428
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,130
He was always good to me and my mom.

429
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,790
He always helped me out
whenever I was struggling.

430
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:39,020
Sounds a lot like you,uncle lucas.

431
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,590
I don't know about that.

432
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,420
What I do know is that he
loved me and he was proud of me,

433
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,420
just like I love you
and I'm proud of you.

434
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,540
Maybe you're right.

435
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,360
How about you fire her up?

436
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,360
- Me? Really?
- Yeah.

437
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,260
All right,jamie!

438
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,680
double "g" is looking for you.

439
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,150
Things were so much less
mplicated in college.

440
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,560
How so?

441
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,920
I remember walking these halls,

442
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,610
hoping that someday
I'd be a sportscaster...

443
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,400
okay,you got that.

444
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,000
That I'd have a full life,good friends.

445
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,510
You definitely got that.

446
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,030
And every night before bed,

447
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,480
I'd wish that someday
I'd find the right girl,

448
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,790
a good girl,you know?

449
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,280
Someone who loved me as
much as I loved her back.

450
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,500
I don't suppose that
girl's name is gigi.

451
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,020
Okay,I made you a promise. Let's go.

452
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,690
You okay to drive?

453
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,150
Dude,I haven't had a drink for hours.

454
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,590
I've never been so sober.

455
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,670
what,is your next line
inspired by "twilight"?

456
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,050
There is no next line.

457
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,240
Have you looked around?

458
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,900
I might as well go back
to selling coffee here.

459
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,820
Oh,gee,that seems like a lifetime...ago.

460
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,760
What's going on with you?

461
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:41,410
everybody else has families
and kids and careers,and...

462
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,760
I have this.

463
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:48,090
Brooke,don't sell yourself short.

464
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,360
You've got all of us.

465
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,390
You've got a godson who loves you.

466
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,780
And the reason why I came by today

467
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,040
was to tell you about something
really rare that I saw.

468
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,600
Guess what it was.

469
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,240
A unicorn.

470
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,620
I've always wanted to see a unicorn.

471
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,980
Even more rare than that.

472
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,600
It was a group of students
who wanted to study more.

473
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,210
They came over to my
house this afternoon,

474
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:14,740
during school,and guess
who was their leader. Sam.

475
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,070
It's amazing how far she's come

476
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,390
since I found her sleeping
in the backseat of a car.

477
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,450
She's socialized.

478
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,700
She's a solid student.

479
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,720
She's writing.

480
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,630
I think she has a budding
romance with jack happening,too.

481
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,610
And they stayed behind to clean
up the mess after everybody left.

482
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,460
Well,that's a lot more than she did

483
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:38,230
when she trashed this
place and peyton's gown.

484
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,470
That's why I wanted
to tell you --

485
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:45,000
because you should be proud
of her and of yourself.

486
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,650
All that girl needed
was a stable environment,

487
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,710
and you gave it to her.

488
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,640
yeah thanks.

489
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,740
oh,you again.

490
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,110
Oh,no,no,don't let me
interrupt your flow.

491
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,630
I want you to keep writing.

492
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,220
Oh,yeah?

493
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,460
I loved this story you wrote.

494
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,470
My only note would
be -- More,please.

495
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,310
Sam,you have what most
writers would kill for.

496
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,770
A troubled childhood?

497
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,430
A voice -- you have
stories to tell.

498
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,630
All you need is a little structure.

499
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,790
Thank you.

500
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,700
Can I still call you
when you're in L.A.?

501
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,920
I totally meant it
when I invited you,too.

502
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,490
Invited me where?

503
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:39,450
Uh,I gave brooke two plane tickets...

504
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,060
for you guys to come with me to L.A.

505
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,160
- When?
- Tonight.

506
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,620
I guess she didn't tell you.

507
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,230
Nope.

508
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,250
Geez,I thought brooke
was in a dark place.

509
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:06,020
Oh,god,I didn't realize
how late it d gotten.

510
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,170
Got a little carried away drawing.

511
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,540
What's up?

512
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,680
I don't think I've been honest with you.

513
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,910
One of my classes came
over to my house today,

514
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,970
and I realized that,

515
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,700
um,the reason I've
been dragging my heels

516
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,590
when it comes to
committing to my next record

517
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:24,360
is that I really love teaching.

518
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,510
Well,you may feel different

519
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:32,160
when you're teaching to an entire
stadium of students with your music.

520
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,980
And besides,you still have a
really great student in mia.

521
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,020
You did a wonderful
thing in discovering her,

522
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,960
and it makes me feel really good to know

523
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,620
that you're always gonna
be there to guide her.

524
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,900
Well,so will you.

525
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,730
Well,yeah,but,I
mean,when the baby comes,

526
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,150
I'm not gonna be around as much.

527
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,320
We're still a team,though,right?

528
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,800
Of course.

529
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,070
Man,these college girls are nasty.

530
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,120
Can I ask you something?

531
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,240
How are you dealing with
this so well so fast?

532
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,140
I'm dying here.

533
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,250
It still hurts,bro.

534
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,070
I mean,it always does.

535
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,290
But you know what I do?

536
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,000
You freaky text and watch porn?

537
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,040
No,I just tell myself that if deb
is the one,then she'll come back.

538
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:32,010
And if not,then I'm all good because I
know she's still out there -- the right one.

539
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,110
I just haven't met her yet.

540
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:37,440
You once told me if a girl
dumps you,she's not the one.

541
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,460
Maybe nathan's mom just wasn't the one.

542
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,340
Okay,sorry. That sounded weird.

543
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,860
P-pull over. It's my turn to drive.

544
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,380
So,I might be moving to L.A.

545
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,520
Since when?

546
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,100
Uh,since julian invited brooke and me.

547
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,720
Don't freak out.

548
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,400
When would you be going?

549
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,610
Tonight.

550
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,500
Well,that'll be pretty cool.

551
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,380
Right?

552
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,250
Yeah.

553
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:53,580
Listen,I know this sucks for us,but
I really want to do this for brooke.

554
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,380
Jack,she's done so much for me.

555
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,170
Then I guess you should go.

556
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,350
Better start packing.

557
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,030
Sam.

558
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,640
I just...

559
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:23,530
wanted to do that,um,in case I
didn't ever get the chance...to.

560
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,330
I'm sad I never got to meet uncle keith.

561
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,070
Yeah,I'm sad about that,too,buddy.

562
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:49,210
And I'm sorry about
what grandpa dan did.

563
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:52,970
Yeah. We all are,jamie.

564
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,620
Am I still allowed to miss grandpa dan?

565
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,580
Yeah,jamie. Yeah.

566
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,280
I like it here.

567
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,700
You bring something
broken,and you fix it up.

568
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,640
I always liked it here,too.

569
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,780
Mouth,wake up.

570
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,890
- Where are we?
- At millie's place.

571
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,870
What? How?

572
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:01,930
Well,maybe the texting I was doing
before was actually with brooke,

573
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:05,390
and maybe brooke just hooked
me up with millie's address.

574
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,590
Why?

575
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,980
I told you this morning we was
going to fix your broken heart.

576
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,290
So,go fix it.

577
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,290
Oh,sorry.

578
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,080
Um,I just came by to
pick up some of my stuff.

579
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,030
Pulling an all-nighter?

580
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,170
your students walked across
town to be taught by you.

581
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:52,160
It's hard to get them to walk
down the hall for most classes.

582
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,260
Yeah.

583
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,650
Well...

584
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,290
would you ever consider...

585
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:04,650
I love teaching,but I would never
sacrifice my beliefs to do it.

586
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:10,500
You fired me right here in front of
all my kids just because you could.

587
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,950
So,congratulations,principal rimkus.

588
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,560
You made a good teacher ntt wa to teach
and good students not want to learn.

589
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,170
You be proud of that.

590
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,200
I wish that I could get over
things as easily as jamie.

591
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,150
- Well,it's easier when you're 5.
- Yeah.

592
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:50,350
You know,when I see
you with jamie,I think,

593
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,240
"if my little brother
can be such a good father,

594
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,800
then maybe I'll be okay,too.

595
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,890
" Of course you will.

596
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:02,640
And besides,you got a hell of a
head start being raised by keith.

597
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,740
Look at today.

598
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,930
You're already doing it with jamie.

599
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,250
You'll be great.

600
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,740
Thanks.

601
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:18,540
I needed a day like today
-- service and repair.

602
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,310
Service and repair.

603
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,450
Marvin.

604
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,060
Hi.

605
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:44,220
What are you doing here?

606
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,960
I was just in the neighborhood.

607
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,240
Actually,that's not true.

608
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,670
I'M...I'm here because
I can't live without you,

609
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:57,840
millicent huxtable,and
I don't want to anymore.

610
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,580
And I'm sorry.

611
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,930
- What are you doing?
- Julian told me he invited you to L.A.

612
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,510
So I packed your bag.

613
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,170
No,he didn't invite me.

614
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,700
He invited us.

615
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,460
Hang on.

616
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:38,650
I packed my stuff,too. I just
didn't know if you wanted me to come.

617
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,570
Sam,you have school.

618
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,420
They have schools in L.A.

619
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,660
You have jack. You have a life here.

620
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,660
This is a stable environment.

621
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,320
I'm a survivor. I'll roll with it.

622
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,410
You shouldn't have to
keep rolling with anything.

623
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:56,030
That was the whole point of
you coming to live with me.

624
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,720
He loves you. He's a great guy.

625
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,260
He wants us all to try it out together.

626
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,590
Don't you get it?

627
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,470
Most people dream of this moment.

628
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,340
Why aren't we already out the door?

629
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,210
Because most people don't
leave their lives behind

630
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,970
to run off to california with someone

631
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,080
that they have only known for a month,

632
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,900
sam --
that's why.

633
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:23,190
Brooke,you're a good peon,a cool
designer,and a kick-ass mom,but......

634
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,330
Sometimes you're your own biggest enemy.

635
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,550
You're 22.

636
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,500
You have your whole life ahead of you.

637
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,960
You have this awesome dude
at the airport who loves you!

638
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,640
God,you have to go. You have to.

639
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:39,070
* I want to rock 'n' roll *

640
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,000
* I want to give my soul *

641
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,560
* I'm wanting to believe *

642
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:55,620
* I'm not too old  *

643
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,810
* don't want to make it up  *

644
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:06,270
* don't want to let you down *

645
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,980
* I want to fly away  *

646
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,580
{\a6}* I'm stuck on the ground *

647
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,170
where's sam?

648
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,700
She's not coming.

649
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,230
You're not coming.

650
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:29,200
I have a life here,and
sam has her life here.

651
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,690
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

652
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:34,500
And it doesn't
-- I mean --

653
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,730
brooke. Brooke.

654
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,630
It's okay.

655
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:45,260
If this were a movie,it
would end different.

656
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,800
But life's not a movie.

657
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,880
I guess that makes two
films that didn't work out.

658
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:56,750
{\a6}(Final boarding call for
flight 406 to los angeles.)

659
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,920
Goodbye,brooke davis.

660
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,290
I guess we're not going to L.A.

661
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,350
So...

662
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,790
about that kiss...

663
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,220
well,this is awkward.

664
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,190
- Hey.
- Hi.

665
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:46,830
Now,that Was a good day.

666
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:49,040
Yes,it was.

667
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,210
- You tell nathan?
- No.

668
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,990
- Brooke?
- No.

669
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:59,440
Yeah,well,there's always tomorrow.

670
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,540
Yeah.

671
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,160
Hey,I'll be in in just a second,okay?

672
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,640
Okay.

673
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:11,560
* Too many years of dying  *

674
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:16,270
* why is that?  *

675
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:24,350
* And so help me decide  *

676
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:27,170
* Help me to make up, *

677
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,760
* make up my mind  *

678
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:42,100
* wouldn't that save you? *

679
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:46,630
* And so help me decide  *

680
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:49,480
* help me to make up, *

681
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,080
* make up my mind  *

682
00:40:52,080 --> 00:41:18,510
{\a6}* wouldn't that save you? *

683
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:25,960
{\a6}* Save you wouldn't that save you? *

684
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,370
(you don't know me.)

685
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,120
(it's you peyton)

686
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:41,550
(and now we can have it.)

687
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:11,230
(you  didn't even let me ask)
