'cause I'm tattooed

12
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,030

you ask for the truth

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,000
but you know you could do

00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,790
so much better

19
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,760

of fire

355
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:15,170
you're a man who I believe

356
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,650
will never die

357
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,450
luke around?

358
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,550
No.

359
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,880
He had to take karen to the
airport.She had to get back.

360
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,430
She's so beautiful.

361
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,900
Yeah,I kind of like her.

362
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,560
So how does it feel,P.Sawyer?

363
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,080
You have a family now.

364
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,980
You -- you have this whole
other life to look after.

365
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,170
It feels just like I dreamed it would.

366
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,140
Can I hold her?

367
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,490
Yeah!Got her?

368
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,730
Oh,yeah.

369
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,320
Hi,sawyer.

370
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:14,430
I'm your aunt brooke,and
I am gonna spoil you.

371
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:17,380
Yes,I am,sawyer scott.

372
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,180
Sawyer brooke scott.

373
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

374
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:37,540
See,I always knew  you were a brooke.

375
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:42,530
And it is a really
good name,baby brooke.

376
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,090
Just like I dreamed.

377
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:50,380
And what about your dreams,brooke davis?

378
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,410
Are you going somewhere?

379
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,010
Back to new york.

380
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,910
The designs are excellent.

381
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,100
The new line should
stabilize the company.

382
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:19,030
There's nothing left for me to do here.

383
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,680
There are a few things that
I need to leave you with.

384
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:30,680
We need to call our publicist and arrange a series
of interviews announcing your return to the company.

385
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,560
You need to speak with the people at red and
organize some sort of charitable contribution.

386
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,560
And you need to fly to los angeles
and tell that boy that you love him.

387
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,970
What?

388
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:50,710
When I was young,there was a boy
who loved me,and I loved him back.

389
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:56,050
But he wasn't from my circle of friends,and he
was different than what my parents expected...

390
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,910
so I let him go.

391
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:04,870
And not a day has gone
by that I don't regret it.

392
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,670
Why haven't you ever told me this?

393
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,490
Because I've been a terrible mother.

394
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,970
I have a daughter who is...

395
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:23,290
...strong and
bright,kindhearted,so beautiful...

396
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:29,340
and I've nearly broken her with
my inability to open my heart.

397
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,600
But I haven't broken her.

398
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:40,360
She's just as strong and
beautiful and kindhearted as ever.

399
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,900
She simply misnamed her company.

400
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:52,500
Because if this boy julian
loves you... and you love him...

401
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,650
...That's all that matters.

402
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,610
That is the most important thing.

403
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,990
And the clothes can wait.

404
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,210
This is for you.

405
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,160
What is it?

406
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,310
It's the company.

407
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:21,200
It's all
yours -- 100%.

408
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,110
But why?

409
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,420
I'd rather have my
daughter than a company.

410
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,070
But you loved  this company.

411
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:37,130
Yeah. I did.

412
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,680
And I was wrong.

413
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:48,060
I should have loved you
more... and the company less.

414
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,510
I just didn't know how.

415
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,350
Mom?

416
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:21,150
I want you to stay on...
and run things from new york.

417
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,370
You're keeping me?

418
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:27,310
You're good at what you do.

419
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:33,730
And besides... ...you're my mother.

420
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,080
My daughter.

421
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,110
My daughter.

422
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,470
I love you so much.

423
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:55,150
And I'm so proud of you.

424
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,700
60 seconds,mouth.

425
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,390
Thanks,jerry.Thanks.

426
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,140
I thought you took off.

427
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,100
I just wanted to watch my boy work.

428
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,660
I like that --
being your boy.

429
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,620
I like it,too.

430
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,640
Skills called.They're gonna
watch the game with us.

431
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,410
Great.Sounds perfect.

432
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,410
It does,doesn't it?

433
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,150
Jerry: We're back in 10!

434
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,090
God,I love my life.

435
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:43,500
A full slate in the nba kicks off tonight with the
charlotte bobcats,who recently called up nathan scott.

436
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,260
The team says that scott
will take his physical --

437
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,750
mouth: Take a look at
yourself  in a mirror.

438
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,140
Who do you see looking back?

439
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,030
Haley: Is it the person  you want to be?

440
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,950
You made it.

441
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,440
We made it.

442
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,740
What do you think?

443
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,820
dan: Or is there someone
else  you were meant to be --

444
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,800
the person  you should
have been,but fell short of?

445
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,640
Mia: Is someone telling
you  you can't or you won't?

446
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,770
Because you can.

447
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,870
Could you write,"thanks for
the 45 seconds of heaven"?

448
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,730
30.

449
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:55,670
- Wait for me?
- Hell,yeah.

nathan: Believe that
dreams  come true every day.

455
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,040
Because they do.

456
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:51,250
Peyton: Sometimes happiness  doesn't
come from money  or fame or power.

457
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:56,830
Sometimes happiness comes 
from good friends and family

458
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:01,540
and from the quiet nobility
 of leading a good life.

459
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,870
We're gonna try the
lights now,okay,julian?

460
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,510
Okay.

461
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,330
You told me that someday I'd
be ready to let someone in.

462
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,570
I think today mit be "someday.

463
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,270
" Julian: Believe that
dreams  come true every day.

464
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,900
Because they do.

465
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:02,390
If this was a movie,you'd
kiss me right now.

466
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,940
No.

467
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:09,680
I'd say,"I lo you,"
and then I'd kiss you.

468
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,930
I love you.

469
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,970
Brooke: Believe that
dreams  come true every day.

470
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,180
Because they do.

471
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,840
take a ride with me,peyton sawyer?

472
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,880
Don't you mean peyton scott?

473
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,500
peyton:  So take a look in that mirror

474
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:28,640
and remind yourself  to be
happy,because you deserve to be.

475
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,990
Believe that.

476
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:36,460
And believe that dreams
 come true every day.

477
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,210
Because they do.
