00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
previously on "one tree hill".

00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,590
I'having your baby,lucas scott.

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:04,390
I love you.

4
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,270
That was the charleston chiefs.

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,050
You're looking at their newest point guard.

6
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,610
I'm mia.

7
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,190
Chase.

8
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,820
I'm covering for owen.

9
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,330
I had sex last night.

10
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,260
It was a mistake.

11
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,870
It was supposed to be you.

12
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,420
You should design the wardrobe for the moviE.

13
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,870
I'm not a costume designer.

14
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,220
You were there,it's authentic,
and I would be lucky to have you.

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,790
Get the hell off of me!

16
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:29,970
Jack!Jack!

17
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,120
Jack!

18
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,890
You took my life,and you turned it into a nightmare.

19
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,270
Brooke,please,don'T.

20
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,560
I need you,moM.

hey,sammy.Love the whole bedhead thing you're rocking there.

31
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,440
Brooke,julian's herE.

32
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,320
Coffee -- black,tons of sugar.

33
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,810
How's jack doing?

34
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,200
Well,his brother's a murderer,so probably like crap.

35
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,010
I haven't talked to him much lately.

36
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,480
Well,he probably really needs you right now.

37
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,400
You can make a big difference for him.

38
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,690
Hi.I'm sorrY.I know that we were supposed to look at costumes today.

39
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,360
I've just been totally turned around dealing with...

40
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:05,760
fashion femme fatale thwarts killer!

41
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,460
the press.

42
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,110
Can't they just go back to stalking britney or something?

43
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:13,970
Oh,come on.

44
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,170
"Hot clothing designer tracks down attacker and exacts revenge.

45
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,040
" If you're not gonna sell me the movie rights,
you should at least ame the tabloid.

46
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,420
So that every time I look at it,
I can be reminded of the fact

47
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,040
that my attacker was also quentin's killer 
and that maybe if i had reported it.

48
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,090
brooke,you were attacked by a guy in a mask.

49
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,020
Even if you had reported it,the chances of the police 
finding him were slim to none.

50
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,010
It's not your fault.

51
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,310
I know.

52
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,500
It's just sad.

53
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,490
Yeah.

54
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,360
Listen,take the day,focus on your work.

55
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,320
I'll come back tonight and see where you're at,okay?

56
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,280
I got you a latte,extra foam.

57
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,800
See you.

58
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,460
- Bye,samson.
- Bye,julian.

59
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,470
You've got a date.

60
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,150
I have a business meetinG.

61
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,090
Yeah,like his junk's got a meeting with your lady business.

62
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,570
Samantha!

63
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,440
What?

64
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,250
wow,that was fast.

65
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,910
I just realized I'm gonna be pregnant on our wedding day,
and that is so redneck.

66
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,490
Well,I think you're gonna look beautiful.

67
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,660
Now,what's really bothering you,huh?

68
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,830
How am I gonna tell brooke?

69
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,470
So,how are you gonna tell peyton?

70
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,530
What?

71
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,660
That you're going out with julian.

72
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,660
Aren't they,like,practically married or something?

73
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,980
I told you,it's not a date.It's business.

74
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,890
He said you were hot.

75
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,980
He said "hot clothing designer tracks down attacker.

76
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,930
" He meant successful.

77
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,870
Yeah.

78
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,280
'Cause thaempty store is just kicking so much fashion asS.

79
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,130
Okay.

80
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,600
He meant hot as in hot.

81
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,360
So do yourself a favor.

82
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,200
Dress a little sexy tonight.

83
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,200
It's definitely a date.

84
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,910
Hi,baby.

85
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,300
You scared me,you wonderful man!

86
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,380
Oh,I missed you.

87
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,380
Good.Shut up and kiss me.

88
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,760
Daddy's home!Daddy's home!

89
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,330
Oh,there he is.

90
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,450
Come here,buddy.I missed you.

91
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,250
I missed you,too.

92
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,330
- How long are you home?
- The whole weekend.

93
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,500
Sweet.

94
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,950
You have to come upstairs and see the new jersey mama bought me.

95
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,550
All right.I'll be right up.

96
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,150
So,how does it feel to be a pro basketball player?

97
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,120
Mostly tired and sorE.

98
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,100
It's good to be home,though.

99
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,940
Just take a break from it all.

100
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,750
'Cause you're not gonna be sore and tired after this weekend.

101
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,800
Come on,dad!

102
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,290
- Like I said,it's good to be home.
- Yeah.

103
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,640
- Hey.
- Hey.

104
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,290
Brooke,peyton's here.You can tell her your big news.

105
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,480
What's the news?

106
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,500
There is no big news.

107
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,870
Julian's hot for brookE.

108
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,650
Don't listen to her.

109
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,470
Brooke's totally hot for him,too.

110
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,320
Do you want to go back to living in a car?

111
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,620
Got anything for an awkward silence?

112
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,210
I'm pregnant?

113
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,000
No.No,no,no,brooke,don't cry,honey,okay?

114
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,900
I-I know that you wanted to have a baby,
and I n't want to be insensitive to that.

115
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,220
I just want you to know you are gonna 
have a huge role in this baby's life.

116
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,790
Thank you.

117
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,410
That is not why I want to cry right now...I...

118
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,050
I just finished your second wedding dress,and it has a corset,

119
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,640
a painfully hand-stitched,skinny-girl corset.

120
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,420
Maybe we can just cut a hole for my stomach?

121
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,240
You're really pregnant?

122
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,440
Yeah.

123
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,440
Is it lucas'?

124
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,550
You're pregnant!

125
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,760
Oh,my god!

126
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,770
Okay,I am going to excuse myself from 
this whole brooke/peyton lesbian-love-hug thing.

127
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,270
Don't forget about juliaN.

128
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,190
Hot for brooke.

129
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,810
No.

130
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,610
Totally.

131
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,450
Hi.

132
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,950
I've been sitting here all week after work,just.

133
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:04,690
I'm mad at myself for driving you away,
and I'm mad at you for what you did after thaT.

134
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,170
I packed your stuff.

135
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,200
I was thinking about just giving it away to a complete stranger -- 

136
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,970
you know,like you did with your virginity?

137
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,190
My virginity was mine,marvin.

138
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,860
It was never yours.

139
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,790
No,but you were.

140
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,890
Have fun telling brooke you slept with owen.

141
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,340
it's a good start,mia.It is.

142
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,010
I know,but I owe peyton a song,not a good start.

143
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,710
can I help you?

144
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,560
I just wanted to talk to mia,
but I don't want to interrupt,so.

145
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,260
Chase.

146
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,150
Hi.

147
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,430
You have to push the talk bacK.

148
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,270
Hi.

149
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,740
Hi,haley.

150
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,830
Hey,man.

151
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,400
Did you need something?

152
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:22,400
Well,um.I was wondering if you wanted to hang out sometime.

153
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,020
Like,go out,maybE.

154
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,040
With me.

155
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,490
Smooth.

156
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,990
Sure,I'd love to.

157
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,450
Take that,my friend.

158
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,230
She's totally into me.

159
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,690
Yeah?She also totally just heard everything you saiD.

160
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:47,590
Uh.okay.Just want to come by to tric,like,8:00?

161
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,620
Okay.Cool.

162
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,400
- Cool.
- Cool.

163
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,140
- Bye.
- Bye,dude.

164
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,730
Oh,hey,honey,do you need help?

165
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,860
- No,I -- aah!
- Geez!

166
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,660
I'm so sorry!I had it!

167
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,310
It's baby brooke!

168
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,940
Oh,but I thought this was all -- 

169
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,960
tied up in litigation with my evil bitch mom.

170
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,500
It is,but these are the samples.

171
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,480
Brooke,these are really,really good.

172
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,170
God,why is victoria so petty that 
she won't let you have just this one little part of the company?

173
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:30,860
I think the better question is why anybody bothers having children 
when they're just gonna refer to you as "evil bitch mom" someday.

174
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,130
Yours is not going to do that.

175
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,490
Okay.

176
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:43,010
Speaking of kids,sam seems to think you and julian are meant for each otheR.

177
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,880
She heard him asking me to work tonight,and she is having a field day with it.

178
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,090
Hey,if you like him,don't bench yourself on my account.

179
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,960
No.It's nothing.

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,250
Not gonna happen.

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,750
So,when's this thing with you and brooke gonna happen?

182
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,250
Brooke and i are working together.

183
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,210
Mm.I think you like her.

184
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,740
- Do not.
- Do too.

185
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,230
- Do not.
- Do too.

186
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:07,810
No.

187
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
So,I hear you like brookE.

188
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,000
We are working togetheR.

189
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,360
I have to get an office.

190
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,580
He so likes her.

191
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,030
That's what I said.

192
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,740
I think you're jealous.

193
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,690
Dude,get over yourself.She's pregnant.

194
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,860
My bad.

195
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,890
Um.see ya.

196
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:39,830
Wow.That's,uh,really hard to hear for historical reasons.

197
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,900
but great news for you and luke.

198
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,150
I mean that.

199
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,120
Thank you.We're excited about it.

200
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,570
You should be.

201
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,850
And I'm happy for yoU.

202
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,670
That kid just won the lottery.

203
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,800
Oh,I'm sorrY.I have to take thiS.

204
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,420
Yeah,sure,no,I'll give you your space.

205
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,280
You break her heart,I break your facE.

206
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,870
Come in!

207
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,720
Oh,millie,thank goodness you're here.

208
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,120
Do the wor "I'll come back tonight and see 
where you're at" sound even vaguely date-like to you?

209
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,720
- I don'T.
- exactly.

210
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,650
I agree.

211
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,570
Especially since it came hot off the heels of me saying 
I hadn't finished my costume stuff yet.Right?He has to mean businesS.

212
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:34,980
Who?

213
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,260
Julian.

214
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,550
I don't know why I'm even in such a stew about thiS.

215
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,760
I mean,he is so not into me,and even if he were,which he is not,

216
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,200
it would so not be okay for me to be attracted to him.

217
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,460
- are you?
- No.Yes.Maybe.

218
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,690
I don't know.

219
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,080
I don't know.

220
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,310
But it doesn't matter because no matter what,
you cannot do something with your friend's ex,right?

221
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,980
I mean,even if she says she's okay with it,that is a lie on some level,

222
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,880
because we are never actually okay with it.

223
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,840
And.it just isn't done.Right?

224
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,810
Oh,are you crying?

225
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,220
Millie,what's wrong?

226
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,330
I slept with owen.

227
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,850
Get ouT.

228
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,850
Millie.wait.

229
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,580
I'm sorry.I'm so sorry.

230
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,790
I ruined everythinG.

231
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,790
It's okaY.

232
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,100
It's okaY.

233
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,400
Everything's okay.

234
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,750
I need your help.

235
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,040
Packing?

236
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,970
No.

237
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,670
I need help picking out clothes for a date.

238
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:11,630
Are you telling me you've been crisscrossing the country,
singing sad songs to broken-hearted boys,

239
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,420
and yoand you haven't had a date lately?

240
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,610
No,haley,you don't date on the road.

241
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:22,390
You hang out on a stinky tour bus 
and you kiss random boys sometimes,but I don't have date clothes.

242
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,040
This is a disaster.

243
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,240
I'm a musician.I don't have an iron.

244
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,330
And I don't know how to iron even if I did.

245
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,960
And what if it's weird?

246
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,710
What are we gonna talk about?

247
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,470
You know,do I offer to pay for stuff?

248
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,540
Okay,will you hold off on the meltdown?

249
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,000
This is just a datE.

250
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,560
I think I should canceL.

251
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,670
Okay,I have an idea.Look,nathan's back in town for the night.

252
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,970
Why don't we all go out?

253
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,350
Really?

254
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,920
Yeah,it'll be fun.

255
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,320
- You would do that for me?
- Come on,we could use a night out.

256
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,110
That's awesome.

257
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,120
- Thank you!
- Oh,you're welcome.

258
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,050
Maybe -- do you think you could help with the iron?

259
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,610
Oh,don't push your luck,girlie.I'll see you at 8:00.

260
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,300
Hey,luke.

261
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,490
Hey,hales.

262
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,680
Okay,listen.I know peyton wasn't supposed to say anything,
but she told me you guys are pregnant,

263
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,330
and I'm so happy for you!

264
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,750
She wasn't supposed to say anything yet!

265
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,660
She didn't!Ha!I knew it!Congratulations!

266
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,520
Oh,you suck!

267
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:26,890
Get over it.

268
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,280
My best friend's gonna be a daD.Oh,I'm gonna be an aunt!

269
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,840
Listen,whatever you need,I am here for you,okay?

270
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,810
The same goes for you now that nathan's out on the road.
We're always here for yoU.

271
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,190
- Really?
- Yeah.

272
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,980
Good,'cause I need somebody to watch jamie.And andrE.

273
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,310
This was a set-up,wasn't it?

274
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:46,270
Well,the squealing and hugging was really genuine,
but the rest of it was kind of a set-up.

275
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,090
That's okay.We'd be happy to watch the kids.

276
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,680
It'll be good practice.

277
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,390
Cool.Thanks.

278
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,880
Okay,boys,come on in.

279
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,620
Oh.You meant now.

280
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:08,940
Yeah,um,nathan fed them some cake,so they might be a little.

281
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,670
Well,anyway,good luck,and congratulations again.

282
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,200
I'm so happy for you.

283
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,990
You're gonna be a great dad,luke.

284
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,530
And I promise I'll act all surprised when peyton tells me.

285
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,100
Thank you.

286
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,210
Seriously,good luck.

287
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,270
Hi,old friend.

288
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:58,820
Before I say the next thing I'm gonna say,
I want to remind you that I love you.

289
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:08,060
But having said that,you are a complete ass 
for even thinking about messing around with gigi.

290
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,250
As opposed to sleeping with owen.

291
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,970
Okay.

292
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,630
you have a right to be upset,and you have a right to be hurt.

293
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,870
But I can guarantee you that as hurt or upset as you are,
millicent feels worse.

294
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:31,070
Mouth,she lost the two things that matter the most to her,
and she can only get one of them back.

295
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,240
It's stuck in my head,brooke.

296
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,670
All I can see is the two of them.

297
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,540
It's not like I can just decide everything's the samE.

298
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,710
I think you're wrong.

299
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,520
You can decide that everything is the same.

300
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,880
If you can't,then you have to decide if you really love heR.

301
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,240
Come on.

302
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,910
Give me a dart.

303
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,700
Feels good,doesn't it?

304
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,400
It's gonna be okay.

305
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,400
******

306
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,350
******

307
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,320
You guys break that box spring,you're sleeping on the floor.

308
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,580
Follow me,guyS.

309
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,830
Oh,you boys are in luck tonight!

310
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,910
We have all kinds of crazy fun planned!

311
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,710
Why are you talking funny?

312
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
Uh,that's right.

313
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,370
We've got.

314
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,580
Drumroll,please.

315
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,150
Movies!

316
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,190
These are baby movies.

317
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,500
But wait,there's more.

318
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,070
We've got.

319
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:02,100
Macaroni and glue arts and craft thingies.

320
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,150
- Son of a -
- luke.

321
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,180
Most importantly,though,we have.

322
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,570
"mouse trap.

323
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,760
" What is it?

324
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,720
It's only the coolest game ever,man.

325
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,380
I think it's busted.

326
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,690
What else you got?

327
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,240
What do you got in mind?

328
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,880
The game is five-card draw.

329
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,250
One-eyed jacks are wild.

330
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,420
Ante up.

331
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,800
Is this like "go fish"?

332
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,930
It's like taking candy from a 5-year-olD.

333
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,940
chase!What's going on,man?

334
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,860
I had two bartenders call in sick,
and I had no idea it was karaoke night.

335
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,150
Does mia know?

336
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,490
I haven't seen her.

337
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,860
She's coming,though,right?

338
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,270
Say she was coming?

339
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,120
I hate first dates.

340
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,150
god I love first dates.

341
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,220
Long island iced tea,please.

342
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,930
You look amazing.

343
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,940
Thanks.

344
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,220
There's this cool new thing called an iron.

345
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,510
You look busy.

346
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,770
Long story.Working on it,though.

347
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,210
Mind if we hang here for a while?

348
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,210
Sure.

349
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,870
Just don't tell the manager I'm underage.

350
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,500
Done.Thanks.

351
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,590
Did I mention how hot you look?

352
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,120
You diD.

353
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,990
Totally the iron.

354
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,310
Totally yoU.

355
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,220
Be right back.

356
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,510
I think we had a deal.

357
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:20,510
Never try to bluff a bluffer,uncle lucas.

358
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,020
Okay.Are you boys tired yet?

359
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,780
You're funny.

360
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,430
What's next?

361
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,330
dude,you're killing me.

362
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,930
Come on,man,I'm on a datE.

363
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,810
You're gonna make me look like a total loseR.

364
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,070
There you go.

365
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,310
Faster,they're coming.

366
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,890
Hey,boyS.

367
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:09,310
Wow,did you just actually beat nathan?

368
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,090
Yeah,I guess I did.

369
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,520
He kind of sucks.

370
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,880
Play again.I want to watch!

371
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,990
I think getting schooled once is all my ego can take.

372
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,280
Well,mia and I just signed up for karaoke.

373
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,440
You two signed up for karaoke?

374
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,920
That's like kobe and lebron signing up 
for a two-on-two rec-league basketball tournament.

375
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,580
That's completely unfair.

376
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,440
All right,let's see what you got.

377
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:44,900
Sketches of costumes for business meeting,checK.

378
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:51,750
Slightly moody lighting in case I have totally lost my mojo 
and this is actually a date,check.

379
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,160
Okay.

380
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:57,420
Beer says "come on in,get comfortable,let's talk business.

381
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,570
" Wine says o me.

382
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,570
" Hard liquor it iS.

383
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,150
Okay.

384
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,660
Okay,right.

385
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:22,570
Yeah,well,let's just make sure we're paying the minimums,
'cause the last thing we need is the union on our asS.

386
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,680
Uh,were you just on your way out?

387
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,400
We were meeting tonight,right?

388
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,640
Yeah.I-I had a charity thing.

389
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,720
Earlier.

390
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,610
I'm readto roll up my sleeves and get to worK.

391
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,610
Just let me take some of this.

392
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:40,830
Thank you.

393
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,490
Can I get you anything to drink?

394
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,000
Actually,I brought us some wine.I hope that's okay.

395
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,850
Wine is perfecT.

396
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,380
I went by your house a couple times.

397
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,290
Child services keeps showing up,looking for me.

398
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,560
If it helps,I've dealt with them a lot,
and they tend to clock out at around 5:00.

399
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:13,980
Have you eaten?

400
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,330
No.

401
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,730
Nice.

402
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,730
It's fast food.It's just like mama used to make.

403
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:49,230
Ladies and gentlemen,next up,we've got two enormous talents.

404
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,700
Unfortunately,their talent ain't singing.

405
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,400
Please give it up for nathan scott and chase,the new bartender guy.

406
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,330
I told you I'd signed up for karaoke.

407
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,370
I just didn't say who we signed up.

408
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,260
Kobe and lebron.

409
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,480
Kobe and lebron.

410
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,580

Then ya spot a fine woman sittin in your row 


426

Okay,hey,hey!Okay.

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,720
Um,new game,huh?Why don't we play hide-and-seek?

434
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,600
You guys go hide.

435
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,880
We're goa count first.

436
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,370
10,9.

437
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,780
What time is it,anyway,huh?

438
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,040
2:00 A.M.,3:00?

439
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,230
9:15.

440
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:31,830
Oh,god.

441
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,040
How could time possibly be moving so slowly?

442
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,650
They're kids,lucas.

443
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:40,180
They need to be entertained every single secondof every single daY.

444
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,410
How would you feel about a paternity test?

445
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,850
I tell you what.

446
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,870
Why don't you go get some ice cream,and I'll play hide-and-seek?

447
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,870
You want to feed those little monsters ice cream?

448
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,200
Oh,no,no,no.

449
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,980
The ice cream is for me because I am pregnant.

450
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:59,280
I am craving,and if mama ain't happy,ain't nobody happy.

451
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,890
Got it.

452
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,920
All right,here I come!You better have really good hiding spots!

453
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,140
Hi.

454
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,230
Are you drunk?

455
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,060
I thought I meant so much more to you.

456
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,360
I was your frienD.

457
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,300
and partner.

458
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,060
and friend.

459
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,090
Yeah,you said that one alreadY.

460
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,580
But if all you cared about was sex,you can have me,marvin.

461
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,470
If that will fix things,just have all the sex with me you want.

462
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,770
Millicent.

463
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,060
I need you,marvin.

464
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,460
I need.

465
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,520
I need the bathroom.

466
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,360
So,we have home- and away-game ravens jerseys,and for the popular kids,

467
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:05,540
if you want to keep it realistic,cheerleading uniforms,
lettermen jackets,and a lot of jeans.

468
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,680
Well,clearly,you have this under control.

469
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,860
Well,brooke davis will be particularly easy to dress.

470
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,380
Why,because she spent most of high school naked?

471
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,450
No,jerk.

472
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,000
Because I still have all of her clothes.

473
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,000
And I don't care what it says in your little script.

474
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,130
You don't know me well enough to judge me.

475
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,670
Well,actually,I feel like I do know yoU.

476
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,760
Why?Because I'm so transparent?

477
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,010
No.Because of the book.

478
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,190
You know,truth be told,I read it because of peyton,but.

479
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,430
I related to i because of you.

480
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,510
More wine?

481
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:54,140
They're eventually gonna find me,those family-services people.

482
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,270
Look on the bright sidE.

483
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,360
Whoever they put you with couldn't be as bad as your brotheR.

484
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,910
Well,at least I knew what texpe with hiM.

485
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,170
He was still my brotheR.

486
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,340
What did you do when they were gonna come take you away again?

487
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:24,820
Usually I'd just pretend sharon and ozzy osbourne were gonna 
be my next parents and that they'd let me pick out a dog.

488
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,610
When that got old,I woulD.

489
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,360
hold my own hand.

490
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,340
like thiS.

491
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:45,980
Pretend it was somebody else's holding mine,
somebody who actually cared where I was going.

492
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,970
I only did that 'cause no one else was there to do it.

493
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,000
but you've got mE.

494
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:11,740
Hey,all I'm saying is dating a girl on the road is not easy.

495
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,690
She says she's back in tree hill a lot.

496
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,460
Well,yeah,but when she's gone,she's a rock star.

497
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,000
She's in sexy clubs with alcohol.

498
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,530
I mean,just thinking about that stuff will fry your brain.

499
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,870
I can handle it.

500
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,290
Godspeed,my friend.

501
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,560
Oh,and one more thing.

502
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,340
If she ever meets a guy named chris keller,
you punch first and ask questions later.

503
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,020
Got it.

504
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,350
so,I take it you like him?

505
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,620
Oh,my god,he's so cute!

506
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,110
And sweet,too.

507
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,990
Yeah.See,first dates aren't so scary.

508
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,360
Totally not scary.

509
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:58,630
In fact,if you and hubs want to get lost,
I think we might be ready to fly solo.

510
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:01,370
Just make it look natural.

511
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,980
- All right.
- Mm-kay?

512
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,490
hey We should get out of here soon.

513
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,770
Lucas called,and jamie's getting homesick.

514
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,100
Really?

515
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,490
No.Mia just wants to be alone with chase.
It's the best I could come up with.

516
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,940
Nice.Thank you.

517
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,870
Have a good night.

518
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,170
ByE.

519
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,100
What's next?

520
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,080
Yeah,what's next?!

521
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,570
Oh,next,we are gonna play kill uncle lucasjust as soon as he -- hi!

522
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:45,950
Kill uncle lucas!

523
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,740
What's in the bag?

524
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,370
Only the coolest thing ever.

525
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,660
What is it?

526
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,890
walkie-talkies.

527
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,610
Sweet!

528
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:02,630
Awesome!

529
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,560
When I was little,I always wanted a brother to play walkie-talkies witH.

530
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,780
That's sweet.

531
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,860
Oh,yeah?

532
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,170
Oh,that is sweet.

533
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,870
One of us should probably keep an eye on them just to 
make sure they don't get in any troublE.

534
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,980
Got that one covered.

535
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:22,110
Oh,my baby thinks of everything!

536
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,540
You think 're gonna be okay at this?

537
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:30,000
Your uncle lucas and aunt peyton are the coolesT.

538
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,750
I know.

539
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,410
Hey,you go under the bed,and I'll go in the closeT.

540
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,500
Yeah.

541
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,620
I think we're gonna be fine.

542
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,360
I love you.

543
00:32:54,870 --> 00:33:00,110
so,I drop-kicked the company to my mother,
and I washed my hands of everything.

544
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,440
I admire you,letting it all go and starting over like that.

545
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,360
Well,I don't know if it was brave,or if I was just a total coward.

546
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,370
It's brave.

547
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,800
I have a similar situation.

548
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,970
You have an evil bitch mother?

549
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,520
No,perennially disappointed father.

550
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:23,790
I took my mom's last name so I could make it on my own,but time and again,
I go back to my dad for help.

551
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:27,750
And time and again,he makes me feel like a failure.

552
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:31,780
But one of these dayS.

553
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,240
well,here's to that day.

554
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,740
what are you still doing awake,mister?

555
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,150
Shh.

556
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,580
We put them down,like,an hour ago.

557
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,480
This is so awesome. it must be amazing living your dream.

558
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,880
Yeah,it definitely is.

559
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:21,970
But you know how when you're flying over a city 
and it all looks so neat and tidy,

560
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:26,340
like it's different from a distance,but then once you're inside of it.

561
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:27,780
it's not the samE.

562
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:35,390
Yeah.Well,I should probably get you home.

563
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,970
You know,I think I'm gonna stay and work.

564
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:45,240
I kind of owe peyton a song,and,you know,
for once I might actually be inspired.

565
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,900
But you should go.

566
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,540
It's getting late.

567
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,030
And you're old.

568
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,780
Listen,I'm sorry I sort of had to work on our date.

569
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,770
I had a great time.

570
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,250
Good.I'm glad.

571
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,590
Me too.

572
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,930
- Night.
- Bye.

573
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,690
I forgot to ask if you wanted to go out again sometime.

574
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,770
Probably should have kissed you,huh?

575
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,960
so,can I get you anything else?

576
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,290
Another drink or.

577
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,230
I'd love to,but I should probably get going.

578
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,790
Um,this was nice,brooke.

579
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,740
Yes,it was.

580
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,970
Julian,what was this?

581
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,350
Um.

582
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:32,740
we should probably just say this was what it was,
'cause anything else gets complicated.

583
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,580
PerfecT.

584
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,740
I'll see myself out.

585
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,830
this has to be business,right?

586
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,440
I mean,with peyton and.

587
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,750
this should be business.

588
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,720
We can't just -- I mean,I kiss you,and then it gets.

589
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,510
definitely.It would be.

590
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,140
it would be.

591
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,770
Yes.

592
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,280
What happened?

593
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,690
Here,eat these.

594
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,380
Chalky.

595
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,220
i'm sorry,marvin.

596
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,650
I know.

597
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,800
Brooke says she needs a buyer in new york for costumes.

598
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,510
Maybe I should go.

599
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,760
I think that might be best.

600
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,440
You should get some sleeP.

601
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,570
I should probably get going home.

602
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,440
Must be nice.

603
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,960
I could ask brooke.

604
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,270
my brother attacked her.

605
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,670
Besides,I mean,you got a good thing going on there.

606
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,280
Listen,um.

607
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,840
I probably won't see you for a while.

608
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:06,380
- But it -- it doesn't mean that.
- hey.Listen.

609
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:11,740
Sometimes,these foster-home things work out,okay?

610
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,990
Yeah.

611
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,950
Sometimes.

612
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,570
I'll see you.

613
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,710
Hey,luke.You there?

614
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,110
Wake up.OveR.

615
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:42,960
nathan,is that you?

616
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,360
Yeah,man.

617
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,390
These walkie-talkies were a stroke of genius.

618
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,550
Jamie loved his so much,he went to bed with it.

619
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:49,920
Oh,my god.Jamie.

620
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,730
Don't sweat it.

621
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,270
We picked them up.They're fine.

622
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:58,220
Speaking of which,I heard a rumor you're gonna be a daD.

623
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,060
That's pretty cool,man.

624
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,130
Yeah.

625
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,860
Kind of overwhelmed.I don't know how you do it.I'm exhausted.

626
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,970
It's all about teamwork.

627
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,870
You see that girl lying there next to you?

628
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,420
Well,you don't know it now,but.

629
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,800
she's a superhero.

630
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,020
Trust me.

631
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,350
And anyway,we're both here for you,man.

632
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,800
Whatever you neeD.

633
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,790
I just want you to know that.

634
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,030
Thanks,man.

635
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,300
Have a good nighT.

636
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,630
What's going on?

637
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:40,130
Just playing walkie-talkies with my brother.

638
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,650
That's nice.

639
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,820
The boys had fun,right?

640
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:46,660
Yeah,I think so.

641
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,570
'Kay.And I'm gonna be a good mom,right?

642
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,960
I know sO.

643
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:56,220
And our kid's gonna be great,right?

644
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,180
The greatest.

645
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,040
I love you.You know that?

646
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,630
I love you.
