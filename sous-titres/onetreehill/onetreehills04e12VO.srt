1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,790
- NATHAN,LOOK OUT!
- HALEY!

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,070
THERE'S NO REASON TO EXPECT
THIS BABY WON'T BE HEALTHY.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,920
I'M HAVING MONEY PROBLEMS,DAD.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,370
IT'S SERIOUS,AND I NEED YOUR HELP.

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,930
YOU'RE NOT AN INVESTMENT I'M INTERESTED IN.

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,670
WHEN I WAS UNCONSCIOUS,I SAW KEITH.

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,110
THIS IS WHERE I WAS MURDERED,LUKE.

8
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,260
I STILL DON'T BELIEVE THAT JIMMY KILLED YOU.

9
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,400
YOU STILL CAN'T SEE IT,CAN YOU? YOU WILL.

10
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,300
I'M NOT LEAVING HERE
TILL I GET MY DAMN PILLS.

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,230
IT'S EITHER THE PILLS OR ME.

12
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,900
I COULD PASS CALCULUS IN MY
SLEEP. YOU'RE THE ONE FLUNKING.

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,520
AND THIS IS THE KEY TO THE
CABINET WITH THE ANSWERS.

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,400
GOT IT.

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,010
WHAT BRINGS YOU TWO TO SCHOOL SO LATE?

16
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,240
CLEAN TEEN MEETING.

17
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,920
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU VIRGINS FOR LIFE.

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,820
I LOVE YOU,LUCAS.

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,890
I LOVE YOU,TOO,PEYTON.

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,920
<i>SOMETIMES PAIN BECOMES SUCH
A HUGE PART OF YOUR LIFE</i>

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,320
<i>THAT YOU EXPECT IT TO ALWAYS BE THERE,</i>

22
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,600
<i>BECAUSE YOU CAN'T REMEMBER
A TIME IN YOUR LIFE</i>

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,860
<i>WHEN IT WASN'T.</i>

24
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,420
<i>BUT THEN ONE DAY YOU FEEL SOMETHING ELSE,</i>

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,450
<i>SOMETHING THAT FEELS WRONG,</i>

26
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,670
<i>ONLY BECAUSE IT'S SO UNFAMILIAR.</i>

27
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,510
<i>AND IN THAT MOMENT YOU REALIZE YOU'RE HAPPY.</i>

28
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,190
HEY,BLONDIE.

29
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,060
IT'S GONNA BE A GOOD DAY.

30
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,560
IT REALLY IS,ISN'T IT?

31
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,340
OH,RIGHT - PROM.

32
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,750
HEY.

33
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,800
- HI.

34
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,590
JUST ONE?

35
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,950
I'LL TAKE AS MANY AS YOU GOT.

36
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,100
HEY.

37
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,980
OH,AGAIN WITH THE CLEAN
TEEN SHIRT? REALLY?

38
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,310
WELL,GOOD MORNING TO YOU,TOO,SUNSHINE.

39
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,550
WHY ARE YOU SO HAPPY?

40
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,830
DID YOU DO SOMETHING SLUTTY?

41
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,800
YOU COULD SAY I STARTED
MY DAY OFF WITH A BANG.

42
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,470
THIS SHIRT IS LIKE A GUY MAGNET.

43
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,430
I HAVE NEVER GOTTEN SO MUCH
ATTENTION WITH MY CLOTHES ON.

44
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,610
NICE.

45
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,860
WHY ARE YOU STILL STUDYING?

46
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,680
WE HAVE THE KEY TO THE TEST FILES.

47
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,440
I JUST FEEL BAD ABOUT
THE LAST TEST,THAT'S ALL.

48
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,030
WELL,YOU WON'T WHEN YOU
SEE THE BIG FAT "A" ON IT.

49
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,110
AND SPEAKING OF BIG,FAT A's.

50
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,880
GOOD MORNING,LADIES.

51
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,010
HI.

52
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,940
WHY AREN'T YOU WEARING YOUR SHIRT?

53
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,370
HOW ARE BOYS SUPPOSED TO KNOW

54
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,300
YOU'VE CHOSEN A LIFESTYLE OF CELIBACY

55
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,140
IF YOU'RE NOT WEARING YOUR CLEAN TEEN SHIRT?

56
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,200
YEAH,BROOKE,HOW ARE THEY GONNA KNOW?

57
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,820

69
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,140
MOUTH,WHY WON'T CHASE TALK TO ME?

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,070
I SMILED,I FLIPPED MY HAIR,

75
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,960
I RUBBED UP AGAINST
HIM,AND THAT DIDN'T WORK.

76
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,100
AND THAT ALWAYS WORKS.

77
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,500
RUB ALL YOU WANT,BUT HE'S
IMMUNE TO GIRLS LIKE YOU.

78
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,690
HE'S A CLEAN TEEN.

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,970
SO? YOU'RE A VIRGIN.

00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,670
THAT WAS VERY SMOOTH.

99
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,790
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

100
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,320
IT'S NOT THAT EASY TO

101
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,550
NO.

102

"SO I CAN LOOK AT THOSE GREEN EYES

110
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,580
AND KISS YOUR PERFECT LIPS."

111
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,070
DID I MISS ANYTHING?

112
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,510

AT LEAST YOU'LL BE TOGETHER IN DETENTION.

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,700
SO WORTH IT.

117
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,590
YO,NATE. WHAT UP,DOG?

119
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,900
MY DAD HELPED US OUT OF DEBT.

120
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,480
I GOT TO MAKE SURE WE STAY THAT WAY.

121
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,730

00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,820
OH,COME ON,DOG.

127

ME AND YOU TOGETHER,DOG - WE CAN'T LOSE.

132
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,480
NO.

133
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,300
THE ANSWER IS STILL NO.

134
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,790
I'M SORRY. I'M JUST NOT THAT DESPERATE.

135
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,650

136
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,090
BUT WE COULD HAVE BLEW UP THE PLACE,THOUGH.

137
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,680

00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,510
KAREN -

145
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,990
I USED TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE.

146
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,320
I TRIED TO PUT IT TO SLEEP.

147
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,820
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT YOURS NEUTERED.

148
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,640
GOOD MORNING,DEB.

149
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,400
WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR,TARGET PRACTICE?

150
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,460
YOU KNOW,FOR A SMART WOMAN,

151
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,370
YOU'RE BEING STUPID
LETTING DAN INTO YOUR LIFE -

152
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,430
THE ONE WHO ABANDONED
YOU WHEN YOU WERE PREGNANT

153
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,880
AND LEFT LUCAS FATHERLESS,

154
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,390
THE ONE WHO TREATED KEITH
HORRIBLY HIS WHOLE LIFE?

155
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,020
YOU REMEMBER KEITH,DON'T YOU -

156
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,780
THE MAN WHOSE BABY YOU'RE CARRYING?!

157
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,230
THAT'S ENOUGH.

158
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,970
HE WOULD ROLL OVER IN HIS GRAVE

159
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,080
IF HE COULD SEE THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER.

160
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,180
MAYBE MY BEING HERE IS A BAD IDEA.

161
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,970
THIS WHOLE THING WAS A BAD IDEA.

162
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,000
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER CHEATED ON THE TEST.

163
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,410
OR MAYBE IT WAS THE BEST IDEA EVER.

164
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,700
THIS IS SO GOING ON THE FRIDGE.

165
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,380
WOW. GOOD GRADE.

166
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,890
I HAVE THE TOUGHEST TIME WITH CALCULUS.

167
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,740
YEAH,A LOT OF PEOPLE DO.

168
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,360
MAYBE YOU COULD TUTOR ME.

169
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,740
SURE. ANYTIME.

170
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,430
CHECK ME OUT. I'M A SMART VIRGIN.

171
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,310
GREAT.

172
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,990
YOU'RE THE NEW MOUTH.

173
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,550
OKAY,LOOK,JUST SO YOU KNOW,

174
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,540
"KID A" GOES UNDER "R" FOR "RADIOHEAD."

175
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,090
AND WHERE DID I PUT IT?

176
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,730
SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
FOO FIGHTERS FOR SOME REASON.

177
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,500
YOU REALLY ALPHABETIZE YOUR COLLECTION?

178
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,090
YES,ALPHABETIZED BY GENRE AND SUBGENRE.

179
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,190
OKAY,MUSIC GENIUS,

180
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,180
CAN YOU TELL ME WHO SINGS THE
SONG ON THE RADIO RIGHT NOW?

181
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,720
OOH. WATCH AND BE AMAZED.

182
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,980
HMM.

183
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,610
HOW AWESOME IS THAT?

184
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,410
THAT WAS PRETTY AWESOME.

185
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,730
I KNOW.

186
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,420
KIND OF LIKE YOUR SMILE.

187
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,450
OOH.

188
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,430
- HAPPY LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.
- YEAH?

189
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,500
I FEEL LIKE I'M LIVING
IN AN AIR SUPPLY SONG.

190
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,470
WELL,YOU KNOW,IF WE'RE GONNA GO '80s,

191
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,350
I'M MORE OF A VAN HALEN FAN.

192
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,070
NO,IT'S JUST
- EVERYTHING'S BETTER NOW,YOU KNOW?

193
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,800
PINKS ARE PINKER AND BLUES ARE BLUER,

194
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,520
AND EVEN MY FAVORITE FOODS TASTE YUMMIER.

195
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,580
YUMMIER? YUMMIER.

196
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,510
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE FOOD?

197
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,850
CHOCOLATE-CHIP COOKIES.

198
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,680
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
- THEY PROBABLY TASTE SO MUCH BETTER.

199
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,470
IF ANYONE CAN MAKE A CHOCOLATE-CHIP COOKIE

200
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,990
TASTE BETTER,I'M SURE IT'S YOU.

201
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,670
OH,SEE? YOU ARE SO FEELING THE LOVE!

202
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,240
WELL,I'LL SHARE ANYTHING FOR A COOKIE.

203
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,950
COME WITH ME.

204
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,810
SO,YOU KNOW,IF WE'RE BOTH FEELING THE LOVE,

205
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,670
WHAT ARE WE DOING IN A CEMETERY?

206
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,740
THERE'S SOMEBODY I WANT YOU TO MEET.

207
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,810
HI,MOM.

208
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,770
IT'S ME.

209
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,570
SO,THIS IS LUCAS,THE BOY
I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU ABOUT.

210
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,850
LOOK WHAT HE'S DONE. HE'S GOT ME SMILING.

211
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,950
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

212
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,360
HEY,MRS. SAWYER.

213
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,180
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

214
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,690
THAT PEYTON'S THE BEST
THING I HAVE IN MY LIFE.

215
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,710
AND I WOULDN'T EVEN BE
HERE IF IT WASN'T FOR HER.

216
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,750
LIKEWISE.

217
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,280
CAN I HAVE A SEC?

218
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,100
YEAH.

219
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,750
SO,WHAT DO YOU THINK?

220
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,160
HE'S CUTE,HUH?

221
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,250
HEY,KEITH.

222
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,000
OPEN YOUR EYES,LUKE.

223
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,080
I STILL DON'T BELIEVE THAT
JIMMY KILLED YOU,KEITH.

224
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,750
YOU WERE HERE THAT DAY. WHAT DID YOU SEE?

225
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,810
NO!

226
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,930
LUKE? HEY.

227
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,730
YOU OKAY?

228
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,830
YOU'RE GONNA THINK THAT THIS IS CRAZY,BUT...

229
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,740
I DON'T THINK JIMMY KILLED KEITH.

230
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,530
DID THE CLOSET EXPLODE?

231
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,410
HOW DO I LOOK IN THIS?

232
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,360
IS THERE A RIGHT ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION?

233
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,790
WELL,NONE OF MY DRESSES FIT ME ANYMORE!

234
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,880
BABY,YOU'RE PREGNANT. THEY'RE
NOT SUPPOSED TO FIT YOU.

235
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,750
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

236
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,880
THE DOCTOR SAID IT'S GONNA
TAKE SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS TO HEAL,

237
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,250
WHICH MEANS PROM IS FOUR WEEKS AWAY,

238
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,680
WHICH MEANS I AM GONNA BE STUCK
WITH THESE STUPID CRUTCHES!

239
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,560
NO. HEY,YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

240
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,120
IN A PERFECT WORLD,I WOULD
WEAR SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DRESS,

241
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,040
AND I WOULD DANCE WITH THE MAN THAT I LOVE.

242
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,890
BUT EVEN IF THERE WAS A DRESS

243
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,550
SOMEWHERE IN THIS WORLD THAT FIT ME...

244
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,290
I DON'T EVEN HAVE ANY MONEY FOR IT ANYWAY.

245
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,570
IT'S OKAY.

246
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,230
YOU KNOW WHAT?

247
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,170
IT'S OKAY.

248
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,460
I'LL JUST -

249
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,630

250
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,290
AND,YOU KNOW,MOST LIKELY WEARING SWEATPANTS.

251
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,670
HEY,HEY,YOU'LL LOOK GREAT IN ANYTHING,OKAY?

252
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,190
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

253
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,840
EXCEPT MAYBE THAT DRESS.

254
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,540
HALEY,I -

255
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,080
JUST HOW NAKED DO WE HAVE TO GET?

256
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,790

DON'T WORRY,.WIN A IS THIN

258

I DON'T KNOW,MAN.

259
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,440
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ME DANCE. I'M TERRIBLE.

260
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,270
MAN,YOU'LL BE FINE.

261
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,050
WE GOT THE BEST CHOREOGRAPHER IN TOWN.

262
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,600
HEY,NATE,SKILLS SAID YOU'D COME AROUND.

263
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,050
SO,LOOK,YOU CAN'T BE THAT BAD.

264
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,110
SO LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

265
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,150
IS HE AS BAD AS I THINK HE IS?

266
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,570
NO. HE'S WORSE.

267
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,570
MAYBE IT'S THE SONG.

268
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,110
OKAY,SO CHECK IT OUT.

269
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,180
WHAT I NEED IS AN OFF-THE-HOOK HIP-HOP JAM

270
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,950
WITH A REAL EASY BEAT TO FOLLOW.

271
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,330
OKAY.

272
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,910
HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING WITH
YOU AND LUCAS? YOU HAPPY?

273
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,200
I'M HAPPY.

274
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,630
THAT'S MY GIRL.

275
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,860
YOU KNOW,LOVE SOMETIMES
DON'T REALLY MAKE SENSE.

276
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,510
I MEAN,LOOK AT ME AND BEVIN.

277
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,470
YOU TWO MAKE SENSE.

278
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,750
OKAY,TRACK NUMBER TWO ON THIS -

279
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,310

WHAT DO YOU GUYS NEED THIS MUSIC FOR,ANYWAY?

283
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,480
WELL,ME AND NATHAN -

00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,790
NO WAY. WHAT AREN'T YOU TELLING ME?

287
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,410
LET'S JUST SAY YOU GOT
TO SHOW SOME SKIN TO WIN.

288
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,130
YOU GUYS ARE STRIPPING?!

289
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,330
SHUT UP! PLEASE,CAN I TELL LUCAS?

290
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,020
BETTER THAN THAT
- WHY DON'T YOU TELL SOME GIRLS?

291
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,920
'CAUSE THE WAY HE MOVES,

292
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,450
WE'RE GONNA NEED ALL THE
HOME COOKING WE CAN GET.

293
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,030
SO,I WAS - I WAS THINKING,

294
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,680
SINCE YOU SAID YOU'D HELP
TUTOR ME IN CALCULUS...

295
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,020
I DID.

296
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,180
BUT WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?

297
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,600
WELL,I COULD FEED YOU.

298
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,830
WHAT,LIKE A MONKEY IN A CAGE?

299
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,230
FEED YOU LIKE A NICE DINNER
IN A FANCY RESTAURANT.

300
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,540
THAT SOUNDS NICE,TOO.

301
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,320
HOW ABOUT TONIGHT?

302
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,680
YEAH.

303
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,430
DEFINITELY.

304
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,750
CLEAN TEENS,I CALLED THIS EMERGENCY MEETING

305
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,070
BECAUSE THERE IS AN IMPOSTOR AMONG US.

306
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,730
ONE OF YOU HAS SOILED THE CLEAN TEEN NAME,

307
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,280
AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHO THAT PERSON IS.

308
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,710
CHARITY'S OLDER BROTHER IS IN COLLEGE.

309
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,940
WHY DON'T WE TAKE A LOOK AT SOME
OF THE FOOTAGE HE SHOT FOR US?

310
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,080
<i>CLEAN TEEN! CLEAN TEEN!</i>

311
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,760
I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO GO ANY FURTHER.

312
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,360
I THINK WE DO!

313
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,390
SHUT UP,SHELDON.

314
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,190
SO I TOOK MY TOP OFF.

315
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,630
SO WHAT?

316
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,870
IT DIDN'T GO FURTHER THAN THAT.

317
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,370
DON'T MAKE ME BLACK-LIGHT YOU.

318
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:31,880
IT WOULD BE ONE THING

319
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,860
IF YOU FELT A LITTLE
REMORSE FOR YOUR ACTIONS,

320
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,400
BUT YOU CLEARLY DON'T.

321
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,020
SO YOU LEAVE ME WITH NO CHOICE,RACHEL.

322
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,700
YOU'RE OUT OF CLEAN TEENS.

323
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,890
CAN I KEEP THE SHIRT?

324
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,670
NO.

325
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,500
FINE.

326
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,210
COME ON.

327
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,520
WE ARE SO OUT OF HERE.

328
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,550
UM,ACTUALLY...

329
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,410
I'M GONNA STAY.

330
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,010
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

331
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,840
BEAT IT,NERD.

332
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,900
HEY.

333
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,440
I ALMOST DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU

334
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,350
WITHOUT PEYTON ATTACHED TO YOUR HIP.

335
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,520
FUNNY.

336
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,690
WELL,IF IT MATTERS,I APPROVE.

337
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,800
YOU HAVE HAD THE BIGGEST
CRUSH ON HER FOR YEARS.

338
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,930
MOM,GUYS DON'T HAVE
CRUSHES. RLS HAVE CRUSHES.

339
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,400
WELL,WHAT DO GUYS HAVE - THE HOTS?

340
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,120
UGH,"THE HOTS."

341
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,370
SERIOUSLY,WHERE DO YOU
COME UP WITH THIS STUFF?

342
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,010
LOOK,MY POINT IS THAT I'M VERY HAPPY

343
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,240
THAT THE TWO OF YOU HAVE
FINALLY FOUND EACH OTHER.

344
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,170
YOU KNOW,WITH KEITH IT WAS JUST...

345
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,390
I JUST - I LOVED HIM VERY MUCH.

346
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,250
HE SAID SEEING YOU STILL
TAKES HIS BREATH AWAY.

347
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,470
WHAT?

348
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,360
I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS
GONNA TELL YOU THIS,

349
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,790
BUT WHEN I WAS IN THE
HOSPITAL,I SAW KEITH.

350
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,870
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,YOU SAW HIM?

351
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,210
LIKE IN A DREAM?

352
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,590
SORT OF.

353
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,800
IT - IT WAS JUST SO REAL.

354
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,980
YOU KNOW,HE SHOWED ME THINGS,MOM.

355
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,890
HE TOOK ME TO THE SCHOOL,

356
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:19,400
AND I SAW JIMMY LYING
THERE ON THE FLOOR,DEAD.

357
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,650
AND KEITH WAS STANDING ABOVE HIM,

358
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,570
AND HE WAS STILL ALIVE,AS
IF JIMMY DIDN'T KILL KEITH.

359
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,420
LOOK,LUCAS,IT WAS A DREAM.

360
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,240
MOM -

361
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,650
I KNOW THAT IT IS VERY HARD
FOR YOU TO ACCEPT THE TRUTH

362
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,660
BECAUSE JIMMY WAS YOUR FRIEND.

363
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,810
BUT HE SHOT KEITH,JUST LIKE HE SHOT PEYTON.

364
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,640
YOU SHOULD BE THANKFUL THAT
YOU STILL HAVE HER HERE.

365
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,830
N' FOGRANTED.

366
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,250
THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.

367
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,810
I,UH -

368
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,530
MS. DAVIS,I'M GLAD YOU COULD JOIN US.

369
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,350
SORRY.

370
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,610
I'VE ASKED ALL THE TUTOR STAFF TO BE HERE

371
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,570
BECAUSE WE HAVE A SITUATION.

372
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,390
TESTS ARE MISSING FROM
THE TUTOR-CENTER FILES.

373
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,390
<i>WHY AM I HERE?</i>

374
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,700
AS STUDENT COUNCIL PRESIDENT,

375
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,840
YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF WHAT HAPPENED.

376
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,750
OH,YEAH. RIGHT.

377
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,480
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHO
MIGHT HAVE STOLEN THE EXAMS

378
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,690
OR HAD UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS?

379
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,190
I'D LIKE TO HAVE A LIST
OF ALL THE CURRENT STUDENTS

380
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,830
WHO ARE BEING TUTORED.

381
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,270
WHOEVER DID THIS WILL BE EXPELLED.

382
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,280
OR WORSE.

383
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,510
I WILL BET YOU ANYTHING
RACHEL STOLE THOSE TESTS.

384
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,520
WHAT?

385
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,040
WHEN I WAS TUTORING HER,SHE
TRIED TO BRIBE ME FOR THEM.

386
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,460
HALEY,I LIVE WITH RACHEL.

387
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,720
IF SHE'D STOLEN THE TESTS,I'D KNOW.

388
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,580
HEY.

389
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,210
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

390
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,020
YEAH.

391
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,310
YOU STABBED ME IN THE BACK FROM THE FRONT.

392
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,410
OKAY,WE HAVE TWO PROBLEMS.

393
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,550
DID YOU RETURN THE CALCULUS
EXAMS THAT WE STOLE?

394
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,410
MAYBE.

395
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,990
OKAY,I FORGOT.

396
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,220
RACHEL,TURNER KNOWS THE TESTS ARE MISSING,

397
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,660
AND NOW HE'S ON A TOTAL WITCH HUNT.

398
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,090
WHO CARES? HE DOESN'T KNOW IT WAS US.

399
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,480
THE BIGGER PROBLEM IS HOW
YOU LEFT ME HANGING TODAY.

400
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,860
YOU SAID YOURSELF CLEAN TEENS WAS OUR ALIBI.

401
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,210
OTHERWISE,WE CAN'T JUSTIFY
WHY WE WERE IN THE SCHOOL.

402
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,530
THAT IS NOT WHAT'S GOING ON.

403
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,760
YOU SCREWED ME OVER FOR
A GUY WHO WON'T SCREW YOU.

404
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:38,410
<i>OH,PLEASE,LIKE I COULDN'T GET
CHASE AFTER A LITTLE CHASE.</i>

405
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,770
I THINK YOU'RE FORGETTING SOMETHING.

406
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,500
YOU SEE,CHASE IS INTO
SMART,BORN-AGAIN-VIRGIN BROOKE,

407
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,510
NOT STUPID,SLUTTY,"I CHEATED
ON THE CALCULUS TEST" BROOKE.

408
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,420
FINE. BUT HAVE YOU SEEN ME?

409
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,050
BECAUSE I COULD EASILY HAVE
SEX WITH HIM IF I WANTED TO.

410
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,770
INTERESTING.

411
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,550
CARE TO BET ON THAT?

412
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,900
TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH.

413
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,080
DUDE,THESE OUTFITS ROCK.

414
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,180
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA WIN
THAT $1,000 HANDS DOWN.

415
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,290
OR PANTS DOWN.

416
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,040
I DON'T KNOW,MAN. I STILL SUCK.

417
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,550
MAN,WE'RE GONNA BE FINE. I
JUST NEED YOU TO LOOK GOOD.

418
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,140
I'M GONNA DO ALL THE DANCING.

419
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,010
LET'S SEE THE OUTFITS. ALL RIGHT.

420
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,650
HUH?

421
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,560
OH,YEAH.

422
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,450
HELL,NO.

423
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,740
HE'S JUST PLAYING,MAN.

424
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,950
LOOK,I THOUGHT WE'D GO WITH
A DIFFERENT KIND OF UNIFORM.

425
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,400
OH,OKAY.

426
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,580
ALL RIGHT.

427
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,540
DUDE,YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN YOUR FACE.

428
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,340
PEYTON!

429
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,910
I'M SORRY.

430
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,620
THAT IS MESSED UP.

431
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,260
YEAH,I KNOW. THE TIMER DIDN'T GO OFF.

432
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,770
NO,I MEAN,LIKE,I KIND
OF EXPECTED IT,YOU KNOW?

433
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,650
IT WAS LIKE ANOTHER DAY,ANOTHER DISASTER.

434
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:53,970
IT'S LIKE WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED

435
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,100
WE'VE BECOME CHAOS JUNKIES.

436
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,670
SO I TOLD MY MOM ABOUT SEEING KEITH.

437
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,400
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT HOW
MUCH IT WAS GOING TO UPSET HER.

438
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,910
LUKE,YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT HER.

439
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,450
I KNOW,BUT I DID.

440
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,730
I JUST  I  JUST WANT TO LET
IT ALL GO AWAY,YOU KNOW?

441
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,840
I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE THIS ANYMORE.

442
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:23,080
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO JUST BE HAPPY,HMM?

443
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,090
I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK.

444
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,100
SEEMS LIKE I SPEND MORE TIME WITH KEITH NOW

445
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,920
THAN I DID WHEN HE WAS ALIVE.

446
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,570
I'M SORRY. I DON'T WANT TO INTRUDE.

447
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,250
DAN,UM...

448
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,400
I BOUGHT A ROAST FOR DINNER,

449
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,690
AND I DIDN'T KNOW LUCAS HAD PLANS TONIGHT.

450
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:55,480
IT'S GONNA BE TOO MUCH FOR ME.

451
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,560
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME OVER FOR DINNER?

452
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,920
I'D LIKE THAT.

453
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,510
OH... I THOUGHT VAMPIRES
HAD TO BE INVITED IN.

454
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,200
AND I THOUGHT WATER MELTED
WITCHES,YET HERE WE ARE.

455
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,430
THAT WAS QUITE THE
PERFORMANCE YOU PUT ON TODAY.

456
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,870
WHY ARE YOU MESSING WITH KAREN'S HEAD?

457
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,750
HASN'T SHE SUFFERED ENOUGH?

458
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,340
YOU DON'T THINK MY INTENTIONS
TOWARD KAREN ARE SINCERE?

459
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,040
YOU DON'T HAVE A SINCERE
BONE IN YOUR BODY,DAN.

460
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,290
DO YOU REMEMBER THE
NIGHT BEFORE OUR WEDDING?

461
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,530
YOU POUR WATER IN MY FACE,

462
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,920
AND NOW YOU WANT TO TAKE
A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE?

463
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,940
YOU DISAPPEARED AFTER THE REHEARSAL DINNER,

464
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,070
AND MY PARENTS WERE FURIOUS.

465
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,290
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANTED TO HEAR?

466
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,150
I DROVE TO TREE HILL...

467
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,930
AND SPENT THE NIGHT PARKED
IN FRONT OF KAREN'S HOUSE.

468
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,120
I KNEW I WAS ON THE VERGE
OF MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE.

469
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,110
YOU SEE...

470
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,540
KAREN WAS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

471
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,830
YET I WAS TOO PROUD TO TELL HER.

472
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,230
I NEVER LOVED YOU,DEB.

473
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,720
I SETTLED FOR YOU.

474
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,790
AND I MEAN THAT SINCERELY.

475
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,700
YOU'RE A MISERABLE ASS OF A MAN.

476
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,560
NATHAN AND I ARE SO MUCH BETTER OFF

477
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,920
WITHOUT YOU POISONING OUR LIVES.

478
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,310
"NATHAN AND I."

479
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,750
TAKE ANOTHER PILL,BOOZY.

480
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,600
NATHAN CUT YOU OUT OF HIS
LIFE LONG BEFORE I DID.

481
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,450
JEEZ.

482
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,040
WHERE'S NATHAN? I NEED TO SEE HIM.

483
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,310
NOT LIKE THIS YOU DON'T.

484
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,300
DON'T KEEP ME FROM MY OWN SON!

485
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,510
YOU'RE THE ONE RUINING YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH NATHAN.

486
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,650
DON'T PUT THAT ON ME.

487
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,720
I NEED TO SEE HIM!

488
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,010
OH,GOD.

489
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,100
MOM.

490
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,320
HALEY,ARE YOU OKAY?

491
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,730
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

492
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,820
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SHE'S PREGNANT,MOM.

493
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,250
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. I
DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT HER.

494
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,720
WHY DON'T YOU FORGET I EXIST,AND
WE'LL CALL IT EVEN,OKAY?

495
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,070
- I'M SORRY.
- NO,MOM,YOU'RE LEAVING.

496
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,710
DO NOT COME BACK. I'M
NOT DOING THIS ANYMORE.

497
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,740
YOU KEEP LOOKING AT ME WEIRD.

498
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,630
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

499
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,330
IT'S JUST REALLY HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE

500
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,040
THAT YOU'VE NEVER HAD SEX.

501
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,690
IT'S NOT THAT I HAVEN'T
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY.

502
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,930
I JUST WANT TO WAIT UNTIL
I FIND THE RIGHT PERSON.

503
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,100
BUT YOU'VE HAD GIRLFRIENDS?

504
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,280
I'VE HAD ONE SERIOUS GIRLFRIEND,BUT...

505
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,550
IT DIDN'T END WELL.

506
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,930
DID YOU BREAK UP BECAUSE
SHE WANTED TO HAVE SEX?

507
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,430
YEAH.

508
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,520
WITH MY BEST FRIEND.

509
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,740
IT TURNS OUT SHE WAS CHEATING ON ME

510
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,420
PRETTY MUCH THE WHOLE TIME.

511
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,040
WOW. THAT - THAT SUCKS.

512
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,560
YEAH.

513
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,490
I LOST MY GIRLFRIEND AND MY
BEST FRIEND ON THE SAME DAY.

514
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,630
I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD SO MUCH IN COMMON.

515
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,250
IT HAPPENED TO YOU,TOO?

516
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,970
THEY DIDN'T HAVE SEX,

517
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:23,180
BUT MY BEST FRIEND FELL IN
LOVE WITH MY BOYFRIEND  TWICE.

518
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,090
YOU GUYS STILL FRIENDS?

519
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,050
NOT LIKE WE USED TO BE.

520
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,770
I KNOW PEOPLE THINK THAT
BEING IN CLEAN TEENS IS WEIRD,

521
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,590
ESPECIALLY BEING A GUY.

522
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,990
AND TRUST ME,IT'S NOT
'CAUSE I DON'T LOVE GIRLS.

523
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,900
I DO.

524
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,020
BUT I JUST WANTED TO START OVER,YOU KNOW?

525
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,060
I MEAN,THE NEXT RELATIONSHIP I GET INTO

526
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,920
IS GONNA BE WITH SOMEONE I CAN TRUST,

527
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,870
SOMEONE WHO'S COMPLETELY HONEST WITH ME.

528
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,570
MOUTH,YOU DID NOT TELL ME
RACHEL AND BEVIN WERE COMING.

529
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:07,180
YOU GUYS NEED PEOPLE CHEERING
FOR YOU IF YOU WANT TO WIN,

530
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,790
AND WHO'S BETTER AT
CHEERING THAN CHEERLEADERS?

531
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,940
PLEASE TELL ME YOU DIDN'T INVITE HALEY.

532
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,200
I DIDN'T INVITE HALEY,BUT
SKILLS TOLD PEYTON,

533
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,830
WHO MIGHT HAVE TOLD LUCAS,SO THERE'S THAT.

534
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,560
RIGHT.

535
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,970
COMING.

536
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,810
- HEY!
- HI.

537
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:25,940
TURN AROUND.

538
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,610
GET DRESSED. YOU'RE COMING WITH US.

539
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,390
OH,NO,I REALLY DON'T FEEL
LIKE GOING OUT TONIGHT.

540
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,980
WHERE'S YOUR SENSE OF ADVENTURE?

541
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,010
IT PROBABLY GOT KNOCKED OUT
OF ME WHEN I GOT HIT BY A CAR.

542
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,680
WELL,SERIOUSLY,YOU'RE
GONNA WANT TO SEE THIS.

543
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,850
TRUST ME. IT'LL BE A NIGHT TO REMEMBER.

544
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,670
- YEAH,YEAH,YEAH.
- GO!

545
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,270
SO,WHAT DO YOU THINK?

546
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,600
ARE YOU READY TO STUDY?

547
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,630
WELL,WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?

548
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,410
UM...

549
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,100
WE COULD DANCE.

550
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,830
OH,N-
I -

551
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,790
COME ON. COME ON.

552
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,260
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DANCE
TO THIS KIND OF MUSIC.

553
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,910
IT'S EASY. I'LL SHOW YOU.

554
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,410
THIS ISN'T SO BAD,IS IT?

555
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,050
IT BEATS STUDYING.

556
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,860
MY PARENTS WOULD DANCE
LIKE THIS LATE AT NIGHT,

557
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,960
AFTER I WENT TO BED.

558
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,180
I USED TO SIT AT THE TOP OF
THE STAIRS IN MY FOOTIE PAJAMAS

559
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,990
AND JUST WATCH THEM.

560
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,760
THAT WAS,WHAT,A YEAR AGO?

561
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,190
THEY WERE SO HAPPY AND SO IN LOVE.

562
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,670
YOUR HEART IS BEATING REALLY FAST.

563
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,560
IS IT?

564
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,830
DUDE,THAT GUY'S GONNA HAVE A HEART ATTACK.

565
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,280
I CHECKED OUT THE OTHER COMPETITION.

566
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,860
THERE IS NO WAY YOU DON'T WIN.

567
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,620
DID YOU GET A LOAD OF THE
GUY WHO LOOKED LIKE CHEWBACCA?

568
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,660
OH,HEY,I SAW THAT GUY. THAT DUDE IS FURRY.

569
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,310
SKILLS,CHECK THIS OUT.

570
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,780
MAN,THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE.

571
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,790
DAMN,IS IT HOT IN HERE,OR IS IT JUST ME?

572
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,320
WELL,IT'S GONNA BE EVEN HOTTER
ONSTAGE UNDER THOSE LIGHTS.

573
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,190
YEAH?

574
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,510
SO,TELL ME AGAIN

575
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,440
WHY ICE CREAM WAS A GOOD
IDEA ON A COLD NIGHT.

576
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,820
IT'S ALL PART OF MY PLAN TO GET YOU COLD

577
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,400
SO I CAN WARM YOU UP.

578
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,040
MMM. PRETTY DIABOLICAL.

579
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,890
IT'S WHAT I DO,CHASE.

580
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,840
THE BOYS CAN'T RESIST MY CUTENESS.

581
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,500
I DON'T KNOW IF I'D CALL YOU CUTE.

582
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,380
NO?

583
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,470
NAH.

584
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,850
MORE LIKE BEAUTIFUL.

585
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,380
EVEN WITH ICE CREAM ON YOUR FACE.

586
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,270
I GOT IT.

587
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,630
SO,TELL ME MORE ABOUT THIS PLAN.

588
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,430
THIS PLAN WAS YOUR IDEA.

589
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,690
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T GO ON?

590
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,090
YOU SEE ALL THEM PEOPLE OUT THERE?

591
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:55,660
YOU'VE PLAYED BASKETBALL IN
FRONT OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

592
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,770
YEAH,BUT THEY DON'T BE
ALL UP ON YOU LIKE THAT.

593
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,720
PLUS I HAVE MY CLOTHES ON,MAN.

594
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,450
OUR NEXT ACT IS "DOUBLE TROUBLE"!

595
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,480
THAT'S US. WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

596
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,780
MAMA CAME TO SEE HER MAN
DANCE,AND HER MAN'S NOT ONSTAGE.

597
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,430
I KNOW,BABY,BUT THERE'S A
WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE.

598
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:51,530
BUT IF YOU DON'T DANCE FOR ME,

599
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,400
THEN YOU WON'T GET TO SEE ME DANCE FOR YOU.

600
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THINK ABOUT IT.

601
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,470
TAKE IT OFF!

602
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,880
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR STAGE FRIGHT?

603
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,690
MAMA CAME TO SEE HER MAN DANCE.

604
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,890
NATHAN LOOKED GOOD TONIGHT.

605
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,150
NO WONDER YOU'RE PREGNANT.

606
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,160
OH,FUNNY. HOW'S CALCULUS GOING?

607
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,300
FINE. WHY?

608
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,070
I JUST THINK IT'S WILD HOW
YOU WENT FROM FAILING TO FINE

609
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,130
WITH JUST A FEW TUTORING SESSIONS.

610
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,820
YOU'RE JUST GOOD,I GUESS. ANYWAY,SEE YOU.

611
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,640
RACHEL,SOMEONE STOLE SOME
TESTS FROM THE TUTORING CENTER,

612
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,680
AND IF I FIND OUT THAT IT'S
YOU,I AM TURNING YOU IN.

613
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,280
IS THIS IMPORTANT?

614
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,930
I'M RUNNING OVER TO KAREN'S FOR DINNER.

615
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:02,540
I'VE MESSED UP SO MANY
THINGS,THINGS I CAN'T FIX.

616
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,150
HOW LONG IS THIS GONNA TAKE?

617
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,010
I'M RUNNING LOW ON MINUTES THIS MONTH.

618
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,520
PLEASE BE GOOD TO NATHAN.

619
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:12,430
I FAILED HIM TOO MANY TIMES TO COUNT.

620
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,550
HE DESERVES SO MUCH BETTER.

621
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,790
DEB,YOU GOT TO STOP TAKING THOSE PILLS.

622
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,490
IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW.

623
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,930
THEY'RE ALL GONE.

624
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:31,450
DEB?

625
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,630
KAREN,I'M SORRY I'M RUNNING LATE.

626
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,550
I SHOULD HAVE CALLED YOU.

627
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,890
NO,NOTHING IMPORTANT.

628
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,020
WHOA. WHERE'D YOU GO?

629
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,060
WELL,THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST
NOTORIOUS MAKE-OUT SPOTS IN TOWN.

630
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,120
IT ALSO HAS ONE OF THE NICEST VIEWS IN TOWN.

631
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,040
THERE'S A VIEW?

632
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,620
WHO KNEW?

633
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,350
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD TALK.

634
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,190
OKAY.

635
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,000
SORRY.

636
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,250
I HAVEN'T BEEN A CLEAN TEEN VERY LONG.

637
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,900
I KNOW.

638
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,680
I'VE SEEN YOUR TIME-CAPSULE VIDEO.

639
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,100
YOU DON'T SEE TOO MANY TOPLESS VIRGINS.

640
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:54,250
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'VE SEEN THAT.

641
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,550
I DON'T CARE ABOUT WHO YOU WERE,BROOKE.

642
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,390
I CARE ABOUT WHO YOU ARE.

643
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:07,160
I DIDN'T THINK GUYS LIKE
YOU ACTUALLY EXISTED -

644
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:11,530
SWEET AND SINCERE AND HOT.

645
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,710
YOU'RE LIKE A UNICORN.

646
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,130
A UNICORN,HUH?

647
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,190
YEAH.

648
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,090
HOW ABOUT A DRAGON?

649
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,280
YEAH,A DRAGON SOUNDS WAY COOLER.

650
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,560
OKAY.

651
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,840
YEAH,YOU CAN BE THE DRAGON.

652
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,790
MMM. WHAT,TOO HOT?

653
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,750
WHAT? WHAT?

654
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,110
A LITTLE SALTY.

655
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,270
SALTY?

656
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,740
I PUT A DASH OF SALT IN THERE.

657
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,900
IT'S WHAT IT SAID TO DO ON THE RECIPE.

658
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,270
HOW MUCH IS A DASH?

659
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,030
SHOW ME.

660
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:01,370
OH,THAT'S MORE LIKE A HANDFUL.

661
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,370
OH,MY GOD.

662
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,670
OKAY,GREAT.

663
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,750
WELL,MAYBE THIS BATCH WILL BE BETTER.

664
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,000
TRY IT.

665
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,680
NO.

666
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,780
STILL SALTY.

667
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,880
YEAH.

668
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,270
MM-HMM. YEAH.

669
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,930
MAYBE I NEED A SECOND OPINION.

670
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,240
NO!

671
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,100
OH,YOU BETTER RUN.

672
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,550
HOW YOU DOIN',HOT STUFF?

673
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,960
VERY FUNNY. GET IT ALL OUT.

674
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,180
HOW MUCH FOR A LAP DANCE?

675
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,520
YOU DONE?

676
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,310
NOT EVEN CLOSE. I'M SERIOUS.

677
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,020
HOW MUCH FOR A LAP DANCE?

678
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,520
I NEEDED SOME QUICK CASH,OKAY?

679
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,960
WHAT FOR?

680
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,570
THIS.

681
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,230
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE PROM DRESSES
IN THE MATERNITY SECTION.

682
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,970
WHO KNEW?

683
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,160
NATHAN,THIS IS REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

684
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,560
WELL,I'M JUST GLAD THAT WE WON TONIGHT.

685
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,590
OTHERWISE,I WOULD HAVE
HAD TO TAKE THAT BACK.

686
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:08,040
I JUST WANTED YOU TO
HAVE A GREAT PROM,HALES.

687
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,470
WHOA.

688
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,180
THANK YOU.

689
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,470
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE
WAITED TO SAVE THE MONEY

690
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,630
TILL AFTER YOU GOT JOB.

691
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,310
I'LL GET A JOB.

692
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,950
YOU SAID IN A PERFECT WORLD
YOU'D WEAR A PRETTY DRESS,

693
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,410
AND YOU'D DANCE WITH THE MAN YOU LOVE.

694
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,460
WELL,I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA BE DANCING.

695
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,630
THE DOCTOR SAID IT TAKES MOST PEOPLE -

696
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,530
YOU'RE NOT MOST PEOPLE.

697
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,950
I'VE SEEN HOW YOU ARE WHEN
YOU SET YOUR MIND TO SOMETHING.

698
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,700
YOU CAN DO THIS.

699
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,620
I'LL HELP YOU.

700
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,230
I HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME.

701
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,560
I FEEL BAD WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY STUDY.

702
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,700
MAYBE WE COULD TRY AGAIN TOMORROW NIGHT.

703
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,900
YEAH,I'D LIKE THAT.

704
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,860
LOOKS LIKE YOUR DIABOLICAL PLAN IS WORKING.

705
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,870
WELL...

706
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,230
OKAY.

707
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,900
THAT WAS AMAZING.

708
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,560
WELL,WHEN ALL YOU DO IS KISS,

709
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,700
YOU KIND OF GET GOOD AT IT.

710
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,810
YEAH.

711
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:56,150
OH,MAN,I'VE GOT COOKIE DOUGH ALL OVER ME.

712
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,520
IT'S EVEN IN MY BRA.

713
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,510
MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE IT OFF.

714
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,550
WHAT?

715
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,950
SUCKER!

716
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,530
HEY,HEY.

717
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,060
YOU SURRENDER?

718
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,540
OKAY,I GIVE UP. I'M PUTTING THE LID DOWN.

719
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,510
NOW,IF YOU ARE GOING TO
BE TAKING ANYTHING OFF,

720
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:16,470
PLEASE,PLEASE,PLEASE,LET ME HELP YOU.

721
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,170
<i>HAPPINESS COMES IN MANY FORMS -</i>

722
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,260
<i>IN THE COMPANY OF GOOD FRIENDS...</i>

723
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,680
<i>IN THE FEELING YOU GET</i>

724
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,330
<i>WHEN YOU MAKE SOMEONE
ELSE'S DREAM COME TRUE...</i>

725
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:41,540
<i>...OR IN THE PROMISE OF HOPE RENEWED.</i>

726
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,010
YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK YOU
MISSED SOME RIGHT THERE.

727
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,540
REALLY? MM-HMM.

728
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,760
OH.

729
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,440
I TAKE THAT BACK.

730
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,360
THIS IS THE BEST COOKIE I'VE EVER HAD.

731
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,160
REALLY?

732
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,710
<i>IT'S OKAY TO LET YOURSELF BE HAPPY...</i>

733
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,100
YOU'VE BEEN QUIET ALL NIGHT.

734
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,670
OH. I'M SORRY.

735
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,110
IT'S JUST THAT

736
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,280
LUCAS SAID SOMETHING
REALLY UNSETTLING TODAY.

737
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,350
WHAT DID HE SAY?

738
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:25,700
HE SAID HE DOESN'T THINK THAT
JIMMY EDWARDS KILLED KEITH.

739
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,170
<i>...BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW HOW FLEETING</i>

740
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:29,030
<i>THAT HAPPINESS MIGHT BE.</i>

741
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,760
IS THAT RIGHT?
