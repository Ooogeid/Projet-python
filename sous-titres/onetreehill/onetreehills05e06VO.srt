2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,930
I just always wondered
if he knows who I am.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,610
He found a picture of you once.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,690
What'd you tell him?

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,240
I told him you were dead.

6
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,240
It's mia.

7
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,510
She's the magic, Peyton, and I'm telling you, her
spark is getting squashed by this ass of a singer.

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,850
Oh, this is for you.

9
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,330
It's supposed to bring good luck.

10
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,910
I know we just met, but I just
wanted you to know that I'm here.

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,270
Good to know.

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,640
Any student who walks out
that door fails this quarter.

13
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,680
Say goodbye to
extracurricular activities.

14
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,990
Say goodbye to sports, like basketball.

18
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,860
Well, well. Hello, jamie.

19
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,580
How would you like to
come live with grandpa?

20
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,480
Mama! Daddy!Mama!

21
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,910
Hey, baby. What's the matter?

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,630
You did have a bad dream, buddy?

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,480
He tried to get me.

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,420
Who did?

25
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,700
Grandpa dan. He escaped.

26
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,170
From heaven?

27
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,330
Prison.

28
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,900
Did you tell jamie my dad's in prison?

29
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,080
- Maybe.
- Why?

30
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,640
Because he's in prison.

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,250
Why, what'd you tell him?

32
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,720
We told him he was dead.

33
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,590
Man, how am I supposed to know that?

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,970
I mean, he be asking me stuff.

35
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,240
Well, you have to lie to him, man.

36
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,050
He's having nightmares now.

37
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,680
Look, you know, he be tricking me.

38
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,640
He get all, like, cute.

39
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,740
Yeah, I know. He does
have that going for him.

40
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,760
Well, all right, you
said he asked you stuff.

41
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,200
What else did you tell him?

42
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,770
Not much. Just the truth.

43
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:14,910
Like?

44
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,560
Like "the man" killed tupac and biggie, 

45
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,800
never date girls named
bevin, and santa claus is black.

46
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,660
You say anything about the easter bunny?

47
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,710
A bunny that lay eggs?

48
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,560
You know how many questions
he would ask me about that?

49
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,210
All right, just stay clear
of the whole dan thing

50
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,440
until we figure out how
we're gonna handle this, okay?

51
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,710
Fine by me.

52
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,730
I won't say a word.

53
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,460
can I help you?

54
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,400
Is that your room?

55
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,610
It used to be mine.

56
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,370
Want to see it?

57
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,310
You sure?

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,060
I mean, I could be a psycho.
You don't know.It happens.

59
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,850
You're not a psycho.

60
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,070
You're Peyton.

61
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,390
Come on.

62
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,780
It's different.

63
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,420
- molly.
- Molly.Yeah.God!

64
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,610
You know, when I lived
here, the walls were red.

65
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,630
A red bedroom? That's crazy.

66
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,430
Oh, no. It was everything
I wanted it to be.

67
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,220
But I mean, this is nice, too.

68
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,080
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

69
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,870
So, you really loved him, huh?

70
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,800
Lucas?

71
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,380
What, are you some kind of psychic?

72
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,040
Was it really true love always?

73
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,070
One would think that since they charge
by the hour for this little venture, 

74
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,340
you might be more punctual.

75
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,910
Um, you're brooke's mom, right?

76
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,040
Victoria.

77
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,520
Also known as the money
behind this, whatever this is.

78
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,940
And you're the producer?

79
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,250
Yeah, I'm Haley. I'm sorry.

80
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,520
It's nice to meet you. I'm
a good friend of brooke'S.

81
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,980
Ah, brooke has so many good
friends since her success.

82
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,810
Having said that...

83
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,660
I'd like to have a
listen to our investment.

84
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,460
Okay, I'll just give Peyton a call.

85
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,940
No, I really don't have time for that.

86
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,450
And god knows what gutter
Peyton sawyer is lying in.

87
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,020
So, if you don't mind...

88
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,190
you know what? I'm gonna wait in there.

89
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,620
Yeah, that's fine.

90
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,530
Um, that person creeps me out.

91
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,120
Listen, you're gonna
do great. You're fine.

92
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,800
We just want you to play her a few bars of
"no good, " and we'll make her happy, okay?

93
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,940
Right, like that old
thing could ever be happy.

94
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,100
So, obviously this is the acoustic
version, but Mia really is great, 

95
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,690
and I think you're just gonna love her.

96
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,660
So, if you want to come
into the booth with me...

97
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,030
I'm comfortable here.

98
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,130
- Thank you.
- Okay.

99
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,180
Okay, Mia! Whenever you're ready!

100
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,560
The song is called "no good."

101
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,860
She's really nervous.

102
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,320
Can you blame her? It's like she's
playing a private concert for satan's wife.

103
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,230
okay. Thank you.Thank you.Thank you.

104
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,420
No, no, no, no, no!

105
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,030
The song's called "no good"?

106
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,330
Appropriate.

107
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,870
Okay, so, this is a huge waste of money.

108
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,320
I would say it was a waste of time, but
you all failed so quickly, it really wasn'T.

109
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,020
So when you locate
Peyton in that gutter, 

110
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,510
you let her know I'd like to speak with her
before this catastrophe goes any further.

111
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,320
Okay, so, tell me again, what happened?

112
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,230
She walked in...

113
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,520
we walked in and bitch-toria
was there waiting.

114
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,270
Next thing I know, she scares Mia
half to death, then Mia's gone.

115
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,350
- Gone where?
- I don't know.

116
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,790
She just packed up her stuff, said she
sucked a bunch of times, and then took off.

117
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,810
Can you blame her? She
must have been humiliated.

118
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,000
That was ugly.

119
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,770
Can you just give us a few minutes?

120
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,700
What is Lindsey doing here?

121
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,280
She came with me.
We're gonna have lunch.

122
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,290
I don't want her here. You know
how temperamental artists are, Haley.

123
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,640
So, apparently, are label owners.

124
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,780
I don't want anyone in the studio.

125
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,750
Anyone or Lindsey?

126
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,650
Anyone including Lindsey.

127
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,380
Look, I know everyone loves
her. That's great.Fine.

128
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,760
But right now Mia's gone, and she's in here
running her mouth about how ugly everything is.

129
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,520
She didn't mean anything by it, Peyton.

130
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,880
Don't get mad at Lindsey
just because Mia's gone.

131
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,750
I'm not mad at her.

132
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,220
- You sound mad at her.
- I'm not.

133
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,880
I -- maybe I just
don't like her.

134
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,810
Well, you don't have to...

135
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,950
I'm gonna go, Haley.

136
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,080
Yeah, I'll see you.

137
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,320
Hey, Mouth.

138
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,170
You guys scared me.
What's -- what's going on?

139
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,420
- We're hiding from Alice.
- Why?

140
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,680
Have you met Alice?

141
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,150
Carlton.

142
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,620
E wocausrking on the weekends
sucks, and we've all had it.

143
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,810
That's why...

144
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,070
you got to talk to her.

145
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,620
Me? Why me?

146
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,440
You're the only one that's
ever stood up to her, Mouth.

147
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,900
Listen, guys, I don't know.

148
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:07,170
Look, Mouth, either you talk
to her, or we go with plan "B."

149
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,440
What's plan "b"?

150
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,480
We pool all our money together, we
hire a hit man, and take her out.

151
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,610
I say plan "B."

152
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,150
Come on, guys. She's not that bad.

153
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,890
Come on, Mouth. Admit it.

154
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,160
You hate her, too.

155
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,130
And do you know why?

156
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,440
Because Alice is a bitch.

157
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,610
Peyton is a bitch!

158
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,820
Your mom's a bitch.

159
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:33,630
What happened?

160
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,550
She went to the recording studio
and freaked out Mia, who is M.I.A.

161
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,740
Imagine that. And now
I don't have an artist.

162
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,390
I'm sorry, Peyton. I'll talk to her.

163
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,010
Well, it's either that or my fist talks to her
face, and that's gonna be a longer conversation.

164
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,650
I will. I'm sorry.

165
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,510
Thank you. I'm gonna see you at home.

166
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,490
I got to find Mia.

167
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,530
My mother.

168
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,880
- Oh, no.
- What?

169
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,170
- It's him!
- Who?

170
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,910
The hot guy I met at the opening!

171
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,110
Hey, honey.

172
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,900
- Step aside.Hot guy coming through.
- What?

173
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,790
So, listen, I need to buy a
gift for my boss's birthday.

174
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,550
Something nice.

175
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,460
Just please don't spend
my entire paycheck.

176
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,170
I will come up with something.

177
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,460
Okay, cool.

178
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,730
I'll come back by later.

179
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,950
Got to quell a mutiny at work. Bye.

180
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,310
Bye!

181
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,090
Excuse me?

182
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,610
He's cute, huh?

183
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,150
But he was buying a gift for someone.

184
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,820
Oh, please, like Mouth's dating his boss.

185
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,850
You, um...

186
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,980
you like the crew, right?

187
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,840
Crew?

188
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,340
Yeah, you know, the guys at work.

189
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,800
If by "like" you mean "loathe."

190
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,490
I think you'd really like
them if you got to know them.

191
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,990
And I know they'd like you.

192
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,850
Right. Like that's what I'm gonna
do -- go have beers with harry.

193
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,850
It's jerry.

194
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,680
Exactly.

195
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,470
See you at the office.

196
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,640
I'm coming in, daddy!

197
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,120
You need your water
wings, fish face. All right.

198
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,620
Got it? Okay.

199
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,250
Style points for a big splash.

200
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,890
Let's see what you got, jimmy-jam.

201
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,750
Perfect 10. Perfect 10, buddy.

202
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,160
- Come on, nanny carrie!
- Hold on.

203
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,180
Perfect 10, huh, dad?

204
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,380
Throw me, daddy.

205
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,210
Jamie, your dad has to do his rehab.

206
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,510
That's okay. Come here, you
little monkey.You ready?

207
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,780
You splashed me!

208
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,400
- So?
- So?

209
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,330
Not so fun now, huh?

210
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,240
Splashing a little kid, huh?

211
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,460
You got a problem with
that? Let's see what you got.

212
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,230
- Get her, daddy!
- Yeah, get me, daddy.

213
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,840
**********

214
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,980
Mama!

215
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,800
Mama! Mama!

216
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,390
Jamie! Honey, I'm here!

217
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,960
It's okay. Mama's here.

218
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,930
No! I want my other mama!

219
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,380
Nathan, did you hear
what jamiejust said to --

220
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,590
******

221
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,620
Good morning!

222
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,900
Not really.

223
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,940
Can I fix yousome breakfast?

224
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,890
Uh, no, thanks.

225
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,550
I'm thinking I might dropa few pounds.

226
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,140
Oh, come on. You look great.

227
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,570
Yeah.

228
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,060
Where's Jamie?

229
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,010
With skills.

230
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,290
And Nathan'sat physical therapy.

231
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,180
So you'll just have to deal with
all this nicepeace and quiet.

232
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,650
Thought I might gofor a quick swim.

233
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,480
Um, carrie...

234
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,100
I don't want to sound
weirdabout this, but, um...

235
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,740
could you not wear a bikiniin the pool?

236
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,040
Oh, my gosh. Of course.

237
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:04,900
I'm so sorry.

238
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,910
It just seemskind of
inappropriate, you know, around Jamie.

239
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,360
You know, you're absolutely right.

240
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,530
It was poor judgmenton my part.

241
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,090
That's okay. And, you
know, everything else is great.

242
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,770
You're really doinga wonderful job.

243
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,340
Thanks, Haley. I appreciate that.

244
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,520
And I am so sorry.

245
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,520
It won't happen again.

246
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,860
It won't happen again.

247
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,920
I'm serious, mother.

248
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,510
Peyton was really upset.

249
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,950
And anyway, this is my money.

250
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,150
So just stop.

251
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,580
I don't understandwhy you act like this.

252
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,830
"Why?"

253
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,470
Well, let's see.

254
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm staying in a motel.

255
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:40,540
We have modelsthat are a size
four that should be a size zero.

256
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,710
My daughter is hell-benton
destroying her company.

257
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,910
First of all, I'm not
destroying anything.

258
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,880
And second, zero is not a size!

259
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,990
Our models are... tall!

260
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,690
Tall and fat!

261
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,240
Well, maybe you should
go backto new york...

262
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,280
I mean, if you're this unhappy here.

263
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,270
You have my word, all right?

264
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:09,230
I won't meddle in
Peyton'sso-called record label.

265
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,190
Thank you.

266
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,860
What I will not do, however, is hold my
tongue when I thinkyou're making a mistake.

267
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,210
Now eat your breakfast.

268
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,050
Oh, I don't knowif I should.

269
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,080
I am a size four, after all.

270
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,300
But you're not a model.

271
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,790
You're my daughter.

272
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,290
You're far too talentedto
waste your life as a model.

273
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,400
So eat.

274
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,940
Nice work, kid.

275
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,790
You're halfway to sleepingin
a van and checking in to rehab.

276
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,400
Daddy's in rehab.

277
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,820
Different kind of rehab.

278
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,660
What other kind is there?

279
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:16,200
Um, you want to goto the river court?

280
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,570
Did you knowmy grandpa dan?

281
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,070
Yeah, I think we'll goto the river court.

282
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,050
Uncle skills, how comethey
sent my grandpa away?

283
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,570
It's clean. I promise.

284
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,310
Nathan: You told Jamie my dadwent to
prison because he didn't cleanhis room?

285
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,970
Look, man, I was stuck.

286
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,830
I mean, he come up to you with
thosebaby-seal eyes like...

287
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,220
I mean, he just gets youall confused, man.

288
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,760
Well, you're supposedto play
dumb, not scare the hellout of him.

289
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,590
Look, I panicked, all right?

290
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,540
Anyway, man, I don't like lying to him.

291
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,290
Nate, you got to talk to him.

292
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,640
We need to talk.

293
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,900
Did you tell Lindseythat
you don't like her?

294
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,080
Kind of.

295
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,790
What the hell, Peyton?

296
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,780
She's been nice to you.

297
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,430
Okay, in caseyou haven't noticed, I have a
few other problemsto deal with right now.

298
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,960
Do you see this office, this big, empty
office for a labelwith no artists?

299
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,300
You mean the label Lindsey
recommendedI help you with.

300
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,710
Okay, I can't do thisright now.

301
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,800
You have to apologizeto her.

302
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,080
Luke, Mia is missing, okay?

303
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,980
Brooke's mom is killing me.

304
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:39,200
I quit my job, I moved back
home, and I can't do thisright now.

305
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,470
- Can I help you?
- No.

306
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,640
No, you cannot help me.

307
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,250
That is the last thingthat I want.

308
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,640
Go home to your girlfriend, luke, please.

309
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,720
Okay.

310
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,190
What's so important coach got
to see me onthe weekend for, man?

311
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,770
Well, well.

312
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,740
Mrs. James-scott.

313
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,420
Have a seat, Q.

314
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,500
All right.

315
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,110
So, mrs. Scott here says that

316
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,410
you recently left her class despite the threats
of receiving a failing gradefor the quarter.

317
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,160
Yeah, that was justa
little misunderstanding.

318
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,850
But it's all good now, right, mrs. J-s?

319
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,390
Uh, no, quentin, I warned you about
that, and I'm gonna stand by it.

320
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,890
But I do know how
importantbasketball is to you, 

321
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,990
so I figured out a way for
youe to makup your grade.

322
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,730
This book is called"les misÈrables."

323
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,260
Do you know it?

324
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,860
Good. I'm glad.

325
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,070
Now you can read itover
the course of the year, 

326
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,720
turn in biweekly book
reportsfor extra credit, 

327
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:09,100
and as long as you meetyour
deadlines, you'll remain eligibleto play.

328
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,160
And if I don't?

329
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:15,550
I'm not gonna givepreferential
treatment to any studentin my class.

330
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,180
What do you say, Q.

331
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,260
Do we have a deal?

332
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,550
I'll think about it.

333
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,390
That's a great move.

334
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,070
Shame no one's gonna see itthis
year unless you read the book.

335
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,730
Gosh, man! What is this, bad cop/dumb cop?

336
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,240
I said I'd think about it.

337
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,320
What's it to you, anyway?

338
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,620
Well, it matters to
Haley, so it matters to me.

339
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,340
She tends not to give upon
people as easily as I do.

340
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,360
Or maybe wifey'sjust a little afraid I'm
about to break her man'sscoring record, huh?

341
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,810
So she assigned mesome crap book
'cause she knowI won't do it.

342
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,270
Here's the problemwith
that theory --

343
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,700
you're not good enoughto beat my record.

344
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,280
Right, you don't think so?

345
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,580
No.

346
00:18:59,090 --> 00:18:59,960
Okay.

347
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,770
There's one thingthat
every great player has, 

348
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,620
and that's the willto do
whatever it takes to be the best.

349
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,820
I don't see thatin you, Q.

350
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:12,620
And at this point, you don't even have a
team, so, um, maybe you should thinkabout that.

351
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,380
And what team you got, washout, huh?

352
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,900
You so great, right?

353
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,810
Where your team at?

354
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,860
I have a team.

355
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,290
Every day, I wake upand
I put on the uniform --

356
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,850
mistakes, regret, what could have been.

357
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:38,110
And if I could go backand change all that just
by reading a book, trust me, I'd read the book.

358
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,360
And if not...

359
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,630
well, lcome to the team, Q.

360
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,870
Yeah, that's good.

361
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,910
And I could do a whole lineof t-shirts
with slogans like, "zero's not a size"...

362
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,490
and "my mom hatesall my friends."

363
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,170
Hey, she's not horribleall the time.

364
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,980
You haven't been aroundfor
the last couple years.

365
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,350
She cares about me.

366
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,740
Brooke penelope davis!

367
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,130
I'll be in the back.

368
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,930
Did you schedule a
conferencecall with macy's?

369
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,840
- Yeah, 'cause I was
thinking - - well, don't!

370
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,750
In case you have to hear
it, you have zero business sense!

371
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,510
Mom.

372
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,680
Let me finish.

373
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:31,340
For the last three years, I've been calling
the shots, and look how this companyhas grown.

374
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:36,540
You're a talented designer, brooke, but
you don't spin the strawinto gold. I do.

375
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,390
Truth be told, you are
not smart enoughto do it.

376
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,740
Ice queen!

377
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,800
Stop being such a bitchto your daughter!

378
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,730
And did my daughter pay youto say that?

379
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,600
No, I came up with that onefor free.

380
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,060
Well, I advise you keep yourlittle
underachieving mouth shut

381
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,200
because my relationshipwith my
daughter is none of your business.

382
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,470
No, it is when you tear her
downand call her stupid.

383
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,030
See, the truth is, you're
actually worriedshe's smart.

384
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:18,250
And that's a threat to you because when she figures outhow
to do the business side of this company, goodbye, victoria.

385
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,510
You're one to talk.

386
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,840
Once I convince brookethat you're just
another leech sucking off the money teat, 

387
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,480
you will be broke and worthless.

388
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,110
I meant what I said.

389
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,380
Stop tearing down your daughter.

390
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,290
She might have to biteher tongue with you
because you're her mother, but you are not mine.

391
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,690
No, I am not.

392
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,370
As a matter of fact, it's quite
clearyou never had a mother.

393
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,560
Yeah?

394
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,160
Oh, my gosh.Lucas, I
didn't --

395
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,840
it's okay.

396
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,610
Lindsey...

397
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,170
will you marry me?

398
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,010
Say no.

399
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,220
It's what I didwhen he asked me.

400
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,950
Did you fall asleep?

401
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,830
Yeah, I guess.

402
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,240
Well, you better get ready.

403
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,970
We're having dinner with
Nathanand Haley, remember?

404
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,060
Oh, yeah. All right.

405
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,580
Did you talk to her?

406
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,750
I-I tried.

407
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,580
Well, I mean, yeah, I think
she knows my position.

408
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,760
So... we all heard.

409
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,810
You're in linefor the
on-air reporter job.

410
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,680
It's because you stood
upto her. That's why.

411
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:10,770
She must respect that.

412
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,260
I don't know. I...

413
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,990
what's with the powwow?

414
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,420
Want to get back to work?

415
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:22,000
You get back to work.

416
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,400
You hag.

417
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:29,130
Whoever you are, you're fired.

418
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,700
Security!

419
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:44,170
Where the hell is my cane? Haley!

420
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:50,630
Hey, have you seen my --
oh, um, where's --where's Haley?

421
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,240
I think she ran out for
somelast-minute dinner stuff.

422
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,900
I told her I'd do it, but she wanted to.

423
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:56,780
You okay?

424
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,890
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

425
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,130
Okay.

426
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,470
So, are we not supposedto
wear pants tonight?

427
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,770
Funny.

428
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:10,500
I think I overdidmy rehab, and
so I'm havinga little trouble.

429
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,320
This might not be the
mostappropriate job for you.

430
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,770
Stop it.

431
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,670
Nannies are like doctors.

432
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,090
You let your doctor see
youlike this, don't you?

433
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,890
That depends on wherehe
takes me to dinner.

434
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:29,720
You know, Haley asked me notto
wear a bikini in the pool.

435
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,930
She said it was
inappropriatearound Jamie.

436
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,930
- There you go.You good?
- Yeah.

437
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,440
Listen, carrie, I'm sure that
Haley didn't meananything by it.

438
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,920
I mean, I know she likes you.

439
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,010
Yeah.

440
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,700
It's just kind of ironic, you know?

441
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:58,970
I mean, if she's worried about someone
getting turned onout at the pool, 

442
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,170
she probably shouldn't
let yougo shirtless.

443
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,770
So, what's going onwith your
writing, luke? How's it coming?

444
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,710
Good, actually.

445
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,160
I'm kind of on a roll lately.

446
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,600
You got to to beloving that, linds.

447
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,680
Yeah, the editor sideof me is.

448
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,020
The girlfriend sidemisses her boyfriend.

449
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,980
So, how'sphysical therapy, nate?

450
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,530
Pretty good, man.

451
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,680
I'm sore a lot these days.

452
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,100
I spend a lot of timein the pool.

453
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,570
Yeah, he's been
lookingreally good in there.

454
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,260
- His rehab's going great.
- Yeah.

455
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,520
Where's your head, hales?

456
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,490
Um, quentin.

457
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,470
I gave him a second chanceto
kind of turn things around, 

458
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,020
and I'm not sureif he's gonna take it.

459
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,660
He willif he wants to play.

460
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,880
Lindsey: Well, sometimes
youjust don't know about people.

461
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,060
I mean, I gave Peytona second
chance, and she didn't take it.

462
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,220
I have to tell you, I felt so horrible
about that, and I know Peyton did, too.

463
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,670
Victoria has literallybeen
driving Peyton crazy.

464
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,570
Thanks, but there's more to itthan that.

465
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,020
Peyton feels like she hassome sort of
jurisdiction over lucasbecause of their history.

466
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,110
I was really hoping it wouldn'tbe
an issue, but clearly it is.

467
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,090
Lindsey...

468
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,050
Peyton's got a big heart.

469
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,170
Yeah, to go alongwith her big mouth.

470
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,590
I know I wentto an ivy league school, but if
she keeps it up, she's gonna get her ass kicked.

471
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,940
Okay! Easy.

472
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,360
Sorry. I didn't mean that.

473
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,650
I know she's a friendof yours.

474
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,630
I just wanted her to like me.

475
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,780
Yeah, it sounds like it.

476
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,260
What's so funny?

477
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,130
Uh, I'll tell
youwhat's not funny --

478
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,840
the factthat you're down here instead of
upstairs sleepinglike you're supposed to be.

479
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,900
I'm not tired.

480
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,330
- I'll get him.
- No, I got it.

481
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,710
Jamie, bed, now.

482
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,100
Daddy, can you take me?

483
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,110
Jamie, you're gonna
listento your mother, okay?

484
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,950
Now, go on upstairs.

485
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,310
We'll be up in a
coupleseconds to tuck you in.

486
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,730
He is so cute.

487
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,300
He uses it. Trust me.

488
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,630
And now he's scared to deathto
go to bed because of dan.

489
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,390
But can you blame him? Hell, I had
nightmares about dantill I was, what, 19?

490
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,060
- Think we should go talkto him?
- Yeah.

491
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,590
Excuse us.

492
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,230
Hey, and you are not
allowedto clean at all, okay?

493
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,330
You just make lucas do it.

494
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,900
All right. All right.

495
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,490
Cheers, ladies.

496
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,480
So, carrie, how's everything going?

497
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,560
Really good.

498
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,710
By the way, I completely agreewith
what you said about Peyton.

499
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,880
Just because someone has historywith a person
doesn't mean that's whothey should be with.

500
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,880
Buddy, I've been lookingfor that.

501
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,550
It keeps me safefrom grandpa.

502
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,180
Haley: Um, baby, listen, we, uh...

503
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:55,050
we try to protect youfrom
things because we love you, 

504
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:58,710
and that's why we didn't tellyou
the truth about grandpa dan.

505
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,520
The truth is, um...

506
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:05,380
he did some bad things, and
he needed to go away.

507
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,430
Is he ever gonna come back?

508
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,670
Maybe. Someday.

509
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,800
But no matter what, you're
always gonna be safewith us.

510
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:16,400
Mommy and daddy are never gonna
let anythinghappen to you, okay?

511
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,510
Okay.

512
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:25,280
But just in case, can you maybe
checkin the closet and under the bed?

513
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,020
Yeah, I think so.

514
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,010
It's pretty nice, P. Sawyer.

515
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:37,460
Fully stocked barsteps from your
office, complete with a hot bartender, might I add?

516
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,910
Sorry to bother you.

517
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,380
Can I get an autograph?

518
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:46,920
Yeah.

519
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,070
- It's amy.
- Okay.

520
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,540
Well, okay!

521
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:59,570
So, aside from noticinghot
bartenders, how has yourlove life been?

522
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,490
No comment.

523
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,900
She sleeps around a lot, but
there's no one special.

524
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,540
You can be fired. You know that.

525
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:08,310
Um, yeah, but then she'd justcome work
for me, and you'd still bepaying her.

526
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,400
Okay.

527
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:15,390
I'm not calling myselffamous or anything, but the celebrity
makes ita little hard to meet somebodyyou can trust.

528
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,760
Oh, I'll get it!

529
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,850
All right.

530
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,140
Everything all right, guys?

531
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,060
Oh, poor thing.

532
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,510
We all have stuffwe're afraid of.

533
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,560
You know I'm deathly afraidof clowns?

534
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,920
No, I swear to god. It's really sad.

535
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,070
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

536
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,660
I just wanted to sayI've
been thinking about it, and, uh, 

537
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:40,460
I'll do whateverit
takes to remain eligible.

538
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,470
I'm really gladto hear that.

539
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,840
All right, 6:00 A.M. Practice, Q.

540
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,270
Yes, sir.

541
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,650
I guess I'll leave y'allto it.

542
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,440
I got a bookI got to start reading.

543
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,290
Nathan:I'll see you out.

544
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,150
Way to go, coach.

545
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,640
All right.

546
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,940
You madethe right decision.

547
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:08,150
I'm comingfor that scoring title, and
when I'm done, I'm gonna erase you.

548
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,710
Yeah, that's whatI would have said.

549
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,970
Oh, that looks good!

550
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,910
Thank you.

551
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,540
Brooke:You're welcome.

552
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,410
- So, you guys ready to go?
- Yeah.

553
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,140
Hot bartender guycoming this way.

554
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:31,370
I told youhe couldn't resist.

555
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,990
Brooke davis?

556
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,930
Could you maybe sign thisfor me?

557
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,900
Who should imake it out to?

558
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,380
You can make it out to trickfor $37.

559
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,070
It's your bar tab.

560
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,810
I thought you were
askingfor my autograph.

561
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:50,770
Not really an autographkind of guy, especially
when I have no ideawho the person is.

562
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:54,110
Brooke davis. I have a line
calledclothes over bro's --

563
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,730
clothing.

564
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,170
More ofa
t-shirt-and-jeans guy.

565
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,580
Maybe if your namewas levi strauss.

566
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,890
Uh, my name is Peyton.

567
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,010
I actually have an officeright in there.

568
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,360
This is millicent.

569
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,900
And you know...

570
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,980
- brooke, right?
- Yeah.

571
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,240
- She makes clothes apparently.
- Yes.

572
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,310
Well, I'm owen.

573
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,730
Let me know if you want my autograph.

574
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,850
Nice work, B. Davis.

575
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,900
Shut up. Let's go.

576
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,840
You know what? I'm
gonna meet you at home.

577
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,970
So hot!

578
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,070
I'm sorry I disappeared.

579
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,450
I just needed timeto think
about everything, and, honestly, 

580
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,780
I don't think I'm the
one todo all this with --

581
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,630
start your label with.

582
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,220
Why, 'cause you're scared?

583
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:57,160
Because I don't thinkI'm ready, and
I know how importantit is to you.

584
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,690
Okay, Mia.

585
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,820
Why do you write songs?

586
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,740
What do you mean?

587
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,320
When you think about
yourcareer, what do you want?

588
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,780
What's gonna be enough?

589
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,240
I don't know.

590
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,790
All right, maybe you're
right. Maybe you're not ready.

591
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,820
I want to help someone.

592
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:24,960
I want to reach that girlor that boy who wakes up
one day and feelslike it's not worth it anymore.

593
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,980
Why, 'cause you've beenthat person?

594
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,650
Maybe. It's like...

595
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,780
I don't needto be famous, and I
don't need all the moneyin the world.

596
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,550
It's not about that.

597
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,800
It's about that girlwho's having a
horrible day, and she hears your song, 

598
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:43,530
and for five minutes, there's
hope, you know?

599
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:48,880
It's like, for five minutes, the world's
not such a scaryplace for her anymore.

600
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,870
You askedwhat's gonna be
enough -- that'll be enough.

601
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,610
That'll be more than enough.

602
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,870
Okay.

603
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,060
I take it back.

604
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,590
Maybe you are ready.

605
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,310
you're working late.

606
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,460
Someone has to, right?

607
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:36,080
mom, I know this has all
beenreally hard on you, 

608
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:39,540
but I just need youto trust me, okay?

609
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:44,240
And no matter what happens, I
just wantedto tell you that...

610
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,160
I love you... and thatI appreciate you.

611
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:55,460
And... maybe I don't saythat enough.

612
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,670
Of course I trust you, honey.

613
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,430
More than that, I love you.

614
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,570
And I'm so proud of you.

615
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:09,360
I wouldn't miss thisfor the world.

616
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,950
Come here.

617
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,870
you're working late.

618
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,890
Someone has to, right?

619
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:04,150
Mom, I know this has all
beenreally hard on you, 

620
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,400
but I just need youto trust me, okay?

621
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:11,880
And no matter what happens, I
just wantedto tell you that...

622
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:18,750
I love you, and thatI appreciate you.

623
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,190
And... maybe I don't saythat enough.

624
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,490
Whatever. You can lock up.

625
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,570
Lucas:I saw your light on.

626
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,900
Which isn't that surprising.
I know how hard you work.

627
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,830
You know...

628
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,210
you haven't been yourselflately, Peyton.

629
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,960
I mean, not the Peyton I remember.

630
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:21,950
Well, I haven't been that
Peytonfor three years.

631
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,390
What's going on?

632
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,150
Okay.

633
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,760
I went by my old house.

634
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:34,400
There's a teenage girlliving there now.

635
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:37,470
And she showed memy closet door.

636
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,270
And you knowwhat that said?

637
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,510
"Lucas and Peyton. True love always."

638
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,920
"Always, "
lucas --

639
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:48,160
that's what we were supposed to have

640
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:52,870
until you showed up in L.A.Three
years ago and ambushed me.

641
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,400
If by ambushedyou mean proposed to you?

642
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,200
Oh, yeah. Out of the blue.

643
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:04,230
A proposal that was drivenby some insecurity
that I have never been ableto understand.

644
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,260
Insecurity? Right.

645
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:11,530
Let me tell you how
you get"always, " Peyton.

646
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,090
When a man asks youto
marry him, you say yes.

647
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,310
You don't say noand call him insecure.

648
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,430
I never said no!

649
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,340
I said that I loved you and that
i did wantto marry you someday.

650
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:27,710
And -- oh, god, luke!
I wanted to so bad...

651
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,360
but you gave up on us.

652
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,130
- I gave up on us?
- Yes!

653
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,120
By proposing, i gave up on us?

654
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:39,200
No, by not waiting, you gave up on
us, and you knowthat's the truth.

655
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,570
That's great, Peyton!

656
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,930
You want to talk
truth, let's tell the truth.

657
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,920
Okay.

658
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,740
You gave up on me.

659
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,150
That's why you didn'tsay yes!

660
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,390
You didn't thinkI could do it.

661
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,570
You didn't think I could
getmy novel published.

662
00:37:54,580 --> 00:38:00,260
Maybe you just didn't care, because
it wasn't about youor what you wanted.

663
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:06,050
Well, if that's the truth, if I never cared, then
how come every timeI see this stupid book, 

664
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:10,070
I buy it --every
stupid damn time, luke?

665
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,280
You said I was great!

666
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,010
You said I could be great!

667
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,840
You said we were destinedto be together!

668
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:18,220
You said it to the
world, you said it to me, 

669
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:22,470
and I wish you never had because
you did not meanany of it!

670
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,490
Oh, god.

671
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,680
I'm gonna go.

672
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,690
Okay, you know what? I want to pay rent.

673
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,270
I don't know how, but
I'llfigure it out.I just --

674
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,270
whatever this is, I don't
feel right about it.

675
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,520
It's called me being niceto you.

676
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:41,380
- Well, it needs to stop.
- Maybe you're right.

677
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,810
Tough day.

678
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,780
Sucks about carlton, huh?

679
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:28,440
Well, you're lucky.

680
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,720
Guess Alicekind of likes you.

681
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:33,840
God help youif that ever goes south.

682
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,800
Night, buddy.

683
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,380
I'm gonna head home.

684
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,880
By "home, "I hope you mean my place.

685
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,800
Actually, I'm not feeling very well.

686
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,720
Well, maybe you're noton-air
material after all.

687
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:59,110
I mean, if you're gonna
startgetting "sick" on me.

688
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,080
I'm -- I'm
sureit's nothing.

689
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,580
I'll get a good night's
restand be back to normal.
