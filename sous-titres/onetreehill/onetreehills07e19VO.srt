1
00:00:00,787 --> 00:00:02,695
Previously on "One Tree Hill"... 

2
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:08,644
If you talk, I can't
pretend you're somebody else.

3
00:00:12,203 --> 00:00:15,675
If I start to become that
guy that nobody likes... 

4
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:16,546
You won't.

5
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:18,769
I'm gonna make sure you
stay exactly who you are... 

6
00:00:19,073 --> 00:00:20,832
'Cause that's a person worth protecting.

7
00:00:20,837 --> 00:00:22,686
I know I slept with Alex.

8
00:00:22,714 --> 00:00:23,863
But I like you.

9
00:00:23,883 --> 00:00:24,678
A lot.

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,581
Mom?

11
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:32,502
It's time for you to open
a studio and a gallery.

12
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:34,573
Are you okay, mom?

13
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,473
No. I'm not.

14
00:00:37,265 --> 00:00:38,664
I have cancer.

15
00:00:39,362 --> 00:00:41,098
I guess I did all right.

16
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:43,123
You did everything, mom.

17
00:00:50,856 --> 00:00:52,041
What the hell.

18
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:57,479
Anybody home?

19
00:00:58,199 --> 00:00:59,159
Miss me?

20
00:00:59,672 --> 00:01:03,141
"The ex love of my life and
current bane of my existence

21
00:01:03,225 --> 00:01:06,978
made it very clear to me that they
did the wild thing last night!"

22
00:01:07,062 --> 00:01:09,681
- Have you called last looks for hair and makeup yet?
- No. Why?

23
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,767
Brooke, what the hell happened today?

24
00:01:12,818 --> 00:01:15,770
I thought you fell for Alex. I'm sorry.

25
00:01:18,907 --> 00:01:20,697
Excuse me. Are you Katie Ryan?

26
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,376
I met an agent.

27
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,330
He'll either sign me or marry me.

28
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:28,533
Either way, this just
might be the first day

29
00:01:28,617 --> 00:01:30,501
of the rest of my life.

30
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:32,086
I... I can't represent you.

31
00:01:32,154 --> 00:01:33,621
He decided to sign you?

32
00:01:33,672 --> 00:01:35,339
Not yet, but he will.

33
00:01:35,407 --> 00:01:38,209
It turns out... 

34
00:01:40,763 --> 00:01:42,513
I'm his type.

35
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,461
Good morning, boyfriend.

36
00:01:58,798 --> 00:02:00,799
What did I do to deserve this?

37
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:03,368
It's my big-shot director's last day.

38
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:05,704
I thought it deserved something special.

39
00:02:06,873 --> 00:02:08,757
On time, on budget.

40
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:12,827
Well, sort of, give or
take a punched lead actress.

41
00:02:14,163 --> 00:02:16,181
But I think it's gonna be a good film.

42
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:17,999
Sorry about that.

43
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:20,669
And for the record, it's
gonna be a great movie.

44
00:02:21,453 --> 00:02:24,106
Great if I don't miss
picking up today's wardrobe.

45
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:25,891
I got to run.

46
00:02:25,975 --> 00:02:29,861
Do not go long on your
last day, Cecil B. Debaker.

47
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:33,265
I need my boyfriend on my arm
tonight at Quinn's gallery opening.

48
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,528
You're kind of liking calling
me "boyfriend" again, aren't you?

49
00:02:36,163 --> 00:02:37,286
Yeah.

50
00:02:37,353 --> 00:02:39,488
It has a nice ring to it, don't you think?

51
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,200
Brooke... 

52
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:44,192
I'm glad we're back.

53
00:03:04,843 --> 00:03:05,611
Good morning.

54
00:03:08,618 --> 00:03:09,601
You okay?

55
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,237
I see Sara sometimes.

56
00:03:14,607 --> 00:03:16,541
I mean, ever since she died,

57
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:19,728
I, uh, I see her sometimes, and we talk.

58
00:03:21,564 --> 00:03:24,182
I... I'm not crazy, I promise.

59
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,610
It's just lately, since you...

60
00:03:29,238 --> 00:03:31,039
Well, I haven't been seeing her so much.

61
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:35,544
Is that why no pictures?

62
00:03:36,026 --> 00:03:37,057
Pictures?

63
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:40,265
You don't have any pictures
of her in your place,

64
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,734
and I don't want it to be because of me.

65
00:03:42,802 --> 00:03:44,436
It's okay to love her,

66
00:03:44,995 --> 00:03:45,887
the memory of her.

67
00:03:45,938 --> 00:03:48,023
It won't diminish us.

68
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:50,776
And you don't think I'm
weird for seeing her?

69
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,655
All I know is if I could
see my mom right now... 

70
00:03:55,114 --> 00:03:58,233
I would stay up all night talking to her.

71
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,967
Alexander, where are the
changes for today's shooting?

72
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,560
I'm late!

73
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:09,661
Is it hot in here? It feels hot in here.

74
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:11,546
No. No.

75
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,591
Mother.

76
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:17,219
Another button, please.

77
00:04:17,286 --> 00:04:19,774
The slutty-milf look is so not you.

78
00:04:20,306 --> 00:04:23,091
I have to run. I'll see you guys tonight.

79
00:04:23,403 --> 00:04:24,236
See ya.

80
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:26,928
Oh, this is... she's gonna catch us.

81
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:28,764
She's definitely going to catch us.

82
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:31,400
This is gonna end badly.
We... we got to tell her.

83
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:33,468
Don't you worry about a thing.

84
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:35,804
Besides, it's more exciting this way.

85
00:04:36,346 --> 00:04:36,886
Now come here.

86
00:04:39,642 --> 00:04:40,992
We have to tell him.

87
00:04:41,077 --> 00:04:42,977
Tell him what? That we kissed?

88
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:45,480
I mean, I'm not even sure what this is.

89
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:46,981
Well, it's something.

90
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:49,534
And now with Skills back,
it's getting uncomfortable.

91
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:51,653
We need to be honest with him.

92
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:52,821
We owe him that.

93
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:54,039
I know.

94
00:04:54,123 --> 00:04:57,159
Skills is a great guy,
but this is complicated.

95
00:04:57,226 --> 00:04:59,111
It is so messed up.

96
00:04:59,178 --> 00:05:00,762
I should talk to him.

97
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,547
No. I need to.

98
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,933
He's my best friend.

99
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,691
Hey.

100
00:05:11,107 --> 00:05:12,774
Someone is so freakin' fired!

101
00:05:12,842 --> 00:05:15,644
I can assure you that we
looked everywhere, Mr. Avery.

102
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:16,728
Well, look again!

103
00:05:16,813 --> 00:05:18,363
And where is that loser P.A.?

104
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:19,698
He probably took it.

105
00:05:19,782 --> 00:05:20,866
Hey, what's going on?

106
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,735
Mr. Avery's laptop computer has
gone missing from his trailer.

107
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,855
I'm positive that P.A. Brian
did not steal your computer.

108
00:05:26,923 --> 00:05:28,223
Okay. Thank you.

109
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,908
That's so reassuring.

110
00:05:29,992 --> 00:05:32,127
Look, you stick to doing your job, okay?

111
00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:33,628
Just checking for hairs in the gate

112
00:05:33,696 --> 00:05:36,531
and keeping my trailer stocked
with red vines and lube!

113
00:05:36,582 --> 00:05:38,955
Hey, Christian Bale, calm down, okay?

114
00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:40,919
Look, I'm sorry this happened,

115
00:05:40,948 --> 00:05:42,710
but it's just a computer, okay?

116
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,125
The production will replace it.

117
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:46,758
Let's just focus on the work, okay?

118
00:05:47,143 --> 00:05:49,445
I don't give a crap about the computer.

119
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:51,246
It's what's on it.

120
00:05:51,988 --> 00:05:52,981
Here's your wardrobe.

121
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:08,563
It's gonna be a great last day.

122
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:14,703
I'm bored.

123
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:16,772
You can't be bored. You're 7.

124
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:19,624
Do you have any idea how fun being 7 is?

125
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,409
Besides, I got a cure for that.

126
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:22,527
What?

127
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:23,745
Guess who's babysitting you tonight?

128
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:28,300
Aw, please don't say Junk and Fergie.

129
00:06:28,384 --> 00:06:30,084
No. Me. All right?

130
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:32,771
We're having a guys' night,
and it's gonna be a blast.

131
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,889
Aw, sweet!

132
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:36,575
Wait.

133
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:38,310
What about mom?

134
00:06:38,394 --> 00:06:40,695
Mom is going to aunt
Quinn's art gallery opening,

135
00:06:40,763 --> 00:06:42,881
so she's putting on her
pretty face right now.

136
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:45,266
Well, her prettier face.

137
00:06:56,662 --> 00:06:57,996
Okay.

138
00:06:59,298 --> 00:07:02,050
One, two... three.

139
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,648
What are you doing? Why did you stop?

140
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:15,960
It sounds thin.

141
00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:20,337
I think we should... take
another pass at the vocals,

142
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:21,803
maybe double the chorus.

143
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:22,843
What do you think?

144
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:24,427
I think it's great.

145
00:07:24,984 --> 00:07:26,063
Let's keep moving.

146
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:32,343
I really think it needs the work.

147
00:07:32,394 --> 00:07:37,765
The insecure artist thing is
cute, but seriously, it's great.

148
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,661
I mean, whatever happened to
you protecting me as an artist?

149
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:44,247
You remember that guy you became
the last time you recorded,

150
00:07:44,332 --> 00:07:45,382
the one you didn't like?

151
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:46,967
I think he's back.

152
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,637
It's great.

153
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:52,189
Push play.

154
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:12,192
Hey. Hey.

155
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:15,912
Talk about a work of art. You look great.

156
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:18,115
Thanks.

157
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,034
So, you excited for
tonight? How do you feel?

158
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:23,587
You know, if there's a feeling
of being half totally excited

159
00:08:23,655 --> 00:08:25,122
and half completely ready to panic,

160
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:27,457
then that's how I feel.

161
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:29,009
Oh, don't worry. It's gonna be good.

162
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,011
You're kind of great at the
picture-taking thing, you know.

163
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,262
Thanks.

164
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,181
Well, I'm glad you think so.

165
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:35,716
I wanted to give this to you.

166
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:37,584
Oh. What is this?

167
00:08:37,652 --> 00:08:40,020
My way of saying thank you for
being there for me this year.

168
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:42,189
I couldn't have made it
through without my little sis.

169
00:08:52,543 --> 00:08:53,533
I love it.

170
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:55,352
I really do.

171
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,571
I just want tonight to go well, you know?

172
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:58,739
For mom.

173
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,940
Yeah. For mom.

174
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,960
Yeah, well, I didn't
see it coming, either.

175
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:09,704
I know, but... 

176
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:13,056
I just think it's the
best move for both of us.

177
00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:15,488
I look forward to hearing back.

178
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,704
Okay. Bye.

179
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:21,261
- Whoo. Keep your fingers crossed, bro.
- Why?

180
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:23,764
I just pitched to the company
to let me be the east-coast rep.

181
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:25,332
If all goes well, I'm home for good.

182
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,601
And if they don't, are you back to L.A.?

183
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:28,935
No.

184
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,404
Why not? I thought you liked it out there?

185
00:09:30,471 --> 00:09:32,105
I mean, ain't nothin' wrong with Cali.

186
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:33,640
It ain't no place to meet somebody.

187
00:09:34,353 --> 00:09:35,759
But it did give me some time to think,

188
00:09:35,827 --> 00:09:39,846
and what I came up with was I
missed what I had here with Lauren.

189
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:41,615
Lauren?

190
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,316
Yep. I'm gonna get her back.

191
00:09:44,688 --> 00:09:46,536
Have you talked to her about it?

192
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,172
Uh, no. But I'm going to.

193
00:09:49,785 --> 00:09:51,675
What if they don't give
you the job out here?

194
00:09:52,448 --> 00:09:53,677
Then I just quit.

195
00:09:54,304 --> 00:09:56,146
You'd really leave your job in L.A.?

196
00:09:56,214 --> 00:09:56,913
I would.

197
00:09:57,817 --> 00:10:01,451
If I recall, somebody quit their
job in Omaha for love, right?

198
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:06,387
Look, mouth, I had a whole lot
of time to think about this, bro.

199
00:10:07,642 --> 00:10:09,192
I'm just gonna talk to her tonight.

200
00:10:11,145 --> 00:10:12,846
- Hey, man.
- Yeah?

201
00:10:12,897 --> 00:10:13,947
Ain't you gonna wish me luck?

202
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,649
Yeah. Of course.

203
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,043
Good luck.

204
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:29,427
You ready?

205
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:30,981
Yeah.

206
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,332
All right.

207
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:35,318
One... two... 

208
00:10:46,347 --> 00:10:47,964
It's perfect.

209
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:51,651
Just perfect.

210
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:53,837
It's gonna be a perfect night.

211
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:28,642
Can you believe this crowd?

212
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:33,600
I just hope they like my work.

213
00:11:33,635 --> 00:11:35,183
Relax. They love it.

214
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,542
And besides, you... oh.

215
00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:40,307
You didn't.

216
00:11:40,682 --> 00:11:41,561
Do you love it?

217
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,531
I... don't know.

218
00:11:43,562 --> 00:11:45,230
It's kind of weird, you know,

219
00:11:45,314 --> 00:11:48,066
seeing everyone looking up
at a giant version of me.

220
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,237
Come on. I want to show you something.

221
00:11:58,803 --> 00:11:59,700
What's this?

222
00:12:00,212 --> 00:12:02,797
So, everyone attending tonight
takes their own portrait,

223
00:12:02,865 --> 00:12:04,015
and then the camera feeds it

224
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,483
to the flat screens in the gallery,

225
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:08,253
so the people tonight are the live art.

226
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:10,505
That's genius.

227
00:12:10,556 --> 00:12:13,141
Well, then you're the genius,
because I got the idea from you.

228
00:12:13,798 --> 00:12:16,096
The slide show that you made for my mom.

229
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,568
I love you for that.

230
00:12:32,942 --> 00:12:34,568
That's a powerful photograph.

231
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:37,665
She has a knack for
capturing a dramatic moment.

232
00:12:39,902 --> 00:12:41,736
So... have you talked to him?

233
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:44,789
Yeah. I mean, no.

234
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:47,592
Look, I need to talk to
you about that because... 

235
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:48,843
Hey.

236
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:50,962
Well, if it isn't my favorite two people.

237
00:12:51,046 --> 00:12:53,209
Hey, mouth, you mind if I steal
my girl away for one second?

238
00:13:02,836 --> 00:13:05,682
Okay, now, I like to start at the bottom

239
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:07,179
and do the neck first.

240
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:09,530
So just real slow.

241
00:13:10,492 --> 00:13:11,471
And then when you're done with your neck,

242
00:13:11,483 --> 00:13:13,101
you're just gonna start at your sideburns

243
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:14,399
and work your way down to your chin.

244
00:13:14,401 --> 00:13:15,718
Seems like a lot of work.

245
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:17,436
I'm gonna have to do this every day?

246
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,187
If you want to attract girls.

247
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:20,522
Is this how you got mom?

248
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,158
It took a lot more than a close shave

249
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:24,326
to get your mom to fall for me.

250
00:13:24,752 --> 00:13:25,744
Really? Why?

251
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:27,046
Well, when I met your mom,

252
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,414
I wasn't exactly the
nicest guy in the world.

253
00:13:28,992 --> 00:13:29,748
It's true.

254
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:32,084
I was a bit selfish, and I fought a lot.

255
00:13:32,168 --> 00:13:34,202
But you're not like that now.

256
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:35,971
Being with your mom
made me a better person.

257
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,706
You know, now that I think of it,

258
00:13:37,757 --> 00:13:39,892
your mom and your uncle Lucas did.

259
00:13:39,976 --> 00:13:42,511
It must have been fun
having a brother growing up.

260
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:44,813
It's like having a best
friend over all the time.

261
00:13:44,881 --> 00:13:46,048
Yeah.

262
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:50,436
But remember, uncle Lucas and I weren't
really that close when we were your age.

263
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,988
The important part is we
became more like real brothers

264
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:54,440
once we got a little bit older.

265
00:13:55,144 --> 00:13:56,787
But you're right.

266
00:13:57,771 --> 00:14:00,212
Having a brother is a lot
like having a best friend.

267
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,581
It helped make me the man I am today.

268
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:04,826
And I love that guy.

269
00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:09,838
I love you, too, buddy.

270
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,624
So when do I start
shaving, dad? Next year?

271
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:14,460
Well, if your face is like mine,

272
00:14:14,544 --> 00:14:16,045
probably when you're about 22.

273
00:14:22,435 --> 00:14:23,602
You like?

274
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,970
I love it.

275
00:14:25,055 --> 00:14:27,172
We spent a whole week in that village,

276
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,358
and those girls followed me everywhere.

277
00:14:29,426 --> 00:14:31,193
They were inseparable.

278
00:14:36,663 --> 00:14:38,223
I think you just made your first sale.

279
00:14:38,236 --> 00:14:40,502
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

280
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,404
I hope she at least
gets a family discount.

281
00:14:42,472 --> 00:14:44,656
The whole Hollywood glam squad.

282
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:46,658
I'm honored you guys came.

283
00:14:46,743 --> 00:14:48,577
Seriously, Quinn, this is amazing.

284
00:14:48,628 --> 00:14:50,329
Wait. Are you two, uh... 

285
00:14:50,413 --> 00:14:52,831
Back together? Yes.

286
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,967
Oh. Told you.

287
00:14:55,051 --> 00:14:56,585
So, you got any nudes
in this collection or... ?

288
00:14:56,636 --> 00:14:58,971
Whoa. Pay no attention
to Mr. Inappropriate.

289
00:14:59,055 --> 00:15:01,857
Come on, Josh. There must be
a bar around here somewhere.

290
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:04,810
Julian, please tell me this
movie's gonna be over soon.

291
00:15:04,894 --> 00:15:06,645
Today was, in fact, the last day.

292
00:15:06,713 --> 00:15:08,130
We're officially wrapped!

293
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:09,848
Well done. That is so major.

294
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:11,216
Well, thank you.

295
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:14,253
Speaking of major, look
at you go. Congratulations.

296
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,631
Thank you.

297
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:32,227
You've been kind of
distant since I got home.

298
00:15:34,996 --> 00:15:37,176
Look, I owe you an apology.

299
00:15:37,826 --> 00:15:39,428
Why? What for?

300
00:15:39,495 --> 00:15:41,430
I came home for you because I love you.

301
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:44,332
I can't be apart from you,
and I should have never left.

302
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:45,868
Antwon... 

303
00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:47,519
Please tell me you feel the same way.

304
00:15:48,721 --> 00:15:51,123
It's just, things are different.

305
00:15:51,191 --> 00:15:53,142
I mean, maybe if we'd never split up.

306
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:55,260
Yeah, but you said you wouldn't
come to L.A., so I fixed it.

307
00:15:55,272 --> 00:15:56,355
I'm home now.

308
00:15:57,113 --> 00:15:58,722
Why can't it just be like it was?

309
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:03,335
Because it's not like it was.

310
00:16:03,923 --> 00:16:04,843
Is there someone else?

311
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,657
I don't know.

312
00:16:07,157 --> 00:16:08,407
Maybe.

313
00:16:11,077 --> 00:16:13,412
I'm sorry, Antwon.

314
00:16:19,636 --> 00:16:20,986
Oh, baby, that's... 

315
00:16:21,054 --> 00:16:23,228
I said no talking.

316
00:16:25,008 --> 00:16:27,709
So our lead actors are sleeping together.

317
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,377
Here's my surprised face.

318
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:31,113
Where did you even get this?

319
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,215
It was e-mailed to me this morning.

320
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:34,349
By who?

321
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,834
By someone smart enough to know

322
00:16:35,902 --> 00:16:37,385
that you'll do just about anything

323
00:16:37,437 --> 00:16:39,321
to protect Alex from
this getting out there.

324
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:41,273
Julian, we're being blackmailed.

325
00:16:55,604 --> 00:16:57,028
Julian, what's the matter?

326
00:16:58,033 --> 00:16:58,835
This.

327
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:01,375
Oh, baby, that's... 

328
00:17:01,443 --> 00:17:02,726
I said no talking.

329
00:17:03,435 --> 00:17:04,779
I... I didn't do it.

330
00:17:06,407 --> 00:17:07,005
Oh, that's funny.

331
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,984
That sure looks like
you screwing him to me.

332
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:11,115
No. I mean, okay, I did sleep with him.

333
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,578
I just... I didn't make that tape.

334
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:15,078
- Did you get it from Josh?
- No.

335
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,125
I got it from someone who's trying to
blackmail my father for a ton of money.

336
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:21,208
Alex, why don't you just
shoot me in the head?

337
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:22,932
It would save us all so much time.

338
00:17:23,726 --> 00:17:24,765
That's not fair.

339
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:28,585
No. What's not fair is that I keep
trying to find the best version of you,

340
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:30,931
and you just keep showing
me the worst version.

341
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:37,649
So what did you say?

342
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:40,231
I told him I didn't want to
go back to the way it was.

343
00:17:40,774 --> 00:17:42,266
He was really upset.

344
00:17:42,317 --> 00:17:44,618
It was bad. I feel terrible.

345
00:17:44,686 --> 00:17:46,570
I know I should just
take the high road here

346
00:17:46,621 --> 00:17:48,239
and let you find your way back to him,

347
00:17:48,306 --> 00:17:50,791
but... I really like you, Lauren.

348
00:17:50,876 --> 00:17:52,793
It's also my decision.

349
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:55,663
And I have feelings for you, too.

350
00:17:59,301 --> 00:18:01,435
Do you think Antwon's gonna be okay?

351
00:18:08,175 --> 00:18:10,712
Skills. My man. How you been, buddy?

352
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:13,297
Thirsty. Four shots.

353
00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:15,349
Four shots. Coming up.

354
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,185
Well, I mean, there must be
something that can be done.

355
00:18:20,505 --> 00:18:21,681
How about an extension?

356
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:23,713
Check one, two.

357
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:27,661
Annoying, impatient artist
ready to lay down a track.

358
00:18:29,981 --> 00:18:32,366
So you're telling me
there is nothing I can do?

359
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:37,252
Well, that's just great.

360
00:18:39,674 --> 00:18:43,388
You know, it only took the Beatles
a month to record "Abbey Road."

361
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:49,233
Sorry. You... you okay?

362
00:18:50,852 --> 00:18:53,062
The record sounds great, Michael.

363
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:56,440
But it looks like I'm not
gonna be around to finish it.

364
00:18:56,944 --> 00:18:58,726
I'm going back to england.

365
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:01,545
Oh, that's funny.

366
00:19:01,992 --> 00:19:05,104
Because when you said that we
were gonna be working together,

367
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:08,068
I sort of imagined that you'd at
least be in the same hemisphere.

368
00:19:08,136 --> 00:19:09,570
You know what? I'm serious.

369
00:19:09,638 --> 00:19:12,106
Believe me, I have tried moving
heaven and earth to stay here,

370
00:19:12,174 --> 00:19:13,657
but there's a problem with my visa.

371
00:19:16,401 --> 00:19:17,778
I'm being deported.

372
00:19:19,748 --> 00:19:21,698
And where does that leave us?

373
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:23,923
We're scuppered.

374
00:19:24,886 --> 00:19:26,854
I'm afraid there's not gonna be an "us."

375
00:19:33,912 --> 00:19:36,497
I cannot believe she's
giving him the time of day

376
00:19:36,565 --> 00:19:38,065
after he stood her up.

377
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:40,325
And besides, it's gross.

378
00:19:41,102 --> 00:19:42,336
What's gross?

379
00:19:42,404 --> 00:19:45,289
The thought of my mother having sex.

380
00:19:45,357 --> 00:19:46,457
Blech!

381
00:19:46,525 --> 00:19:47,975
Yeah, well, I don't think it's gross.

382
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:49,893
I mean, she's an attractive
older woman, Brooke.

383
00:19:49,945 --> 00:19:51,412
Oh, okay. Stop.

384
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:54,665
I cannot talk about my
mother and sex with you.

385
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:57,084
It's nice that you're
being so sweet about her,

386
00:19:57,168 --> 00:19:59,265
but you need to stick to what you know,

387
00:19:59,308 --> 00:20:00,904
which is designing super-hot clothes

388
00:20:00,956 --> 00:20:02,923
and sleeping with skanky actresses.

389
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,176
Thanks.

390
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,181
Hey, check this out. I kind of like it.

391
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:13,183
You filmed us having sex?

392
00:20:14,141 --> 00:20:15,452
You found my computer?

393
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,770
No. But someone did.

394
00:20:16,855 --> 00:20:18,489
And now Julian and his
father are being blackmailed

395
00:20:18,557 --> 00:20:19,890
for $1 million thanks to you!

396
00:20:19,941 --> 00:20:20,994
What?

397
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:24,278
How could you? It's my career.

398
00:20:24,362 --> 00:20:26,113
It's Julian's career, and Paul's,

399
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:27,865
and all the people that
worked so hard on this film.

400
00:20:27,932 --> 00:20:29,300
They put everything they
had into this project,

401
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:30,985
and now you've just
jeopardized everything.

402
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:33,737
This is not my fault, okay?
My computer was stolen.

403
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:35,876
Not your fault?

404
00:20:36,812 --> 00:20:37,476
Okay.

405
00:20:39,327 --> 00:20:40,794
But here's what I don't get... 

406
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:44,848
why would you make a tape of yourself
having sex when you suck at it?!

407
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:48,836
At least try to be
professional about this.

408
00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:38,846
This guy?

409
00:22:39,288 --> 00:22:40,784
He's laughing at me.

410
00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:43,867
Why do you say that?

411
00:22:44,018 --> 00:22:45,185
Oh, you ready?

412
00:22:45,253 --> 00:22:47,171
Remember all that stuff
that was on Josh's computer

413
00:22:47,238 --> 00:22:48,922
that he was freaking
out about this morning?

414
00:22:49,506 --> 00:22:50,674
Wait for it.

415
00:22:51,617 --> 00:22:54,128
He and Alex made a sex tape,

416
00:22:54,212 --> 00:22:56,714
and now we're being blackmailed
to keep it under wraps.

417
00:22:56,765 --> 00:22:58,415
Oh-ho, no.

418
00:22:58,466 --> 00:23:00,551
Go ahead. You can laugh at me now, too.

419
00:23:01,635 --> 00:23:02,970
You warned me about Alex.

420
00:23:03,054 --> 00:23:05,522
You told me I shouldn't work with her.

421
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,740
Maybe you were right.

422
00:23:07,189 --> 00:23:08,734
Maybe I should just let her fail.

423
00:23:10,358 --> 00:23:13,430
Hey, the... the tape might even
bring the movie some free publicity.

424
00:23:13,498 --> 00:23:16,650
Hey, whoever said "there's no
such thing as bad publicity"

425
00:23:16,718 --> 00:23:18,152
was never on a sex tape.

426
00:23:18,236 --> 00:23:19,920
Trust me.

427
00:23:19,988 --> 00:23:21,104
You have to help her.

428
00:23:23,525 --> 00:23:26,510
Look, I know you're
disappointed in her right now,

429
00:23:26,743 --> 00:23:28,862
but I bet she didn't do this on purpose.

430
00:23:30,465 --> 00:23:32,850
And I bet that deep down in your heart,

431
00:23:32,917 --> 00:23:34,218
you want to help her.

432
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,003
So do it.

433
00:23:36,471 --> 00:23:37,788
You really mean that?

434
00:23:37,856 --> 00:23:40,600
This is not a test, Julian.

435
00:23:40,975 --> 00:23:44,511
Yes. I think you should help Alex.

436
00:23:47,699 --> 00:23:49,942
So he's not laughing at me, then?

437
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:53,352
Well, maybe a little.

438
00:23:56,808 --> 00:23:59,409
Chase Adams back behind the bar.

439
00:23:59,477 --> 00:24:01,278
Well, it's only beer, wine, and shots,

440
00:24:01,329 --> 00:24:02,813
so I can't do that much damage.

441
00:24:03,673 --> 00:24:05,199
I'll take a beer.

442
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,918
So, I'm a little jealous

443
00:24:07,986 --> 00:24:09,753
now that you'll be spending
your days and nights

444
00:24:09,821 --> 00:24:10,938
hanging out with some other girl.

445
00:24:11,728 --> 00:24:13,040
What?

446
00:24:13,124 --> 00:24:14,842
Somebody bought your portrait.

447
00:24:14,926 --> 00:24:16,877
She's, um... oh, she's right there.

448
00:24:38,386 --> 00:24:40,215
I am so excited you like his portrait.

449
00:24:40,749 --> 00:24:41,933
I just love it!

450
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:44,281
And now meeting the subject,

451
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:46,923
well, that makes it all the more special.

452
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:49,270
I'm Katie.

453
00:24:49,692 --> 00:24:50,522
Clay.

454
00:24:52,715 --> 00:24:55,026
I don't want to take up all
your time on your special night,

455
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:58,370
and I want to see the rest of
your work, so please excuse me.

456
00:25:05,891 --> 00:25:06,868
I like her.

457
00:25:07,605 --> 00:25:09,212
And she seems to like your portrait.

458
00:25:10,253 --> 00:25:12,855
I guess I'll just have to get
used to letting you be with her.

459
00:25:15,825 --> 00:25:17,509
Tonight seems to be going well, huh?

460
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,927
Yeah.

461
00:25:27,197 --> 00:25:29,022
Can you, uh, just
excuse me for one second?

462
00:25:29,053 --> 00:25:29,982
Sure.

463
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,264
I'm sorry.

464
00:25:36,146 --> 00:25:37,780
So there's nothing we can do?

465
00:25:37,847 --> 00:25:39,131
Nope.

466
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:40,928
I have to leave.

467
00:25:41,985 --> 00:25:43,302
And sooner than later.

468
00:25:46,122 --> 00:25:48,841
Well, I guess it's back to my day job.

469
00:25:48,908 --> 00:25:50,626
We'll find someone to
finish the record with you.

470
00:25:50,693 --> 00:25:51,744
I promise.

471
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:53,595
I don't want anyone else.

472
00:25:53,663 --> 00:25:55,345
And that's both guys talking the musician

473
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,445
and the guy who just needs you.

474
00:26:06,245 --> 00:26:07,375
What are you doing?

475
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:12,431
Oh, I thought I looked hotter as a blonde.

476
00:26:12,515 --> 00:26:14,133
What do you think?

477
00:26:14,893 --> 00:26:16,509
I told you I couldn't represent you,

478
00:26:16,517 --> 00:26:18,383
and now you show up here uninvited,

479
00:26:18,395 --> 00:26:20,339
texting me inappropriately
about my girlfriend?

480
00:26:20,406 --> 00:26:22,274
I mean, who do you think you are?

481
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,013
Clay... 

482
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:27,196
I can be whoever you want me to be.

483
00:26:27,263 --> 00:26:28,831
You need to leave.

484
00:26:29,282 --> 00:26:30,199
Now.

485
00:26:31,168 --> 00:26:32,297
I'm sorry.

486
00:26:33,561 --> 00:26:35,854
I felt a connection between the two of us.

487
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,108
I guess... 

488
00:26:39,175 --> 00:26:40,658
I guess I was wrong.

489
00:26:53,616 --> 00:26:54,472
Don't. Don't.

490
00:26:55,376 --> 00:26:57,092
You're not gonna find
any answers in there.

491
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,393
You don't have to do this.

492
00:26:58,444 --> 00:26:59,444
Do what?

493
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:01,596
Always try to save me.

494
00:27:01,648 --> 00:27:04,566
It seems no matter what I
do, I mess things up for you.

495
00:27:04,617 --> 00:27:07,619
Trust me, I never meant
to hurt you or your father

496
00:27:07,687 --> 00:27:09,454
or the movie that we just made.

497
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,357
But now that the film's over,
I'll just get out of your way.

498
00:27:12,425 --> 00:27:14,476
Do what you want to do with
the tape. I'll understand.

499
00:27:14,544 --> 00:27:16,292
Alex, it's gonna be okay.

500
00:27:16,326 --> 00:27:17,488
We're gonna get through it.

501
00:27:17,495 --> 00:27:18,857
And you're not going anywhere.

502
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,365
We're gonna get through this together.

503
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:23,502
I'm gonna do everything I can to help you.

504
00:27:23,586 --> 00:27:24,353
I promise.

505
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,686
Really?

506
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:28,724
Really.

507
00:27:32,595 --> 00:27:34,513
Thank you, Julian.

508
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:36,348
Don't thank me.

509
00:27:37,008 --> 00:27:38,584
Thank Brooke.

510
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:47,126
"He turned away to give them
time to pull themselves together;

511
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:49,528
"and waited, allowing his eyes to rest

512
00:27:49,612 --> 00:27:51,530
on the trim cruiser in the distance."

513
00:27:51,614 --> 00:27:53,282
So the boys were saved?

514
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:54,700
In the end, yeah.

515
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:57,019
I like it when you read to me.

516
00:27:57,086 --> 00:27:58,003
So do I.

517
00:27:58,477 --> 00:27:59,922
It was sad when Piggy died.

518
00:27:59,989 --> 00:28:02,107
I know, man. I like Piggy, too.

519
00:28:02,821 --> 00:28:05,761
It's good that the boys had
each other on the island.

520
00:28:06,516 --> 00:28:09,715
It must have been pretty
lonely and scary all alone.

521
00:28:10,844 --> 00:28:12,050
Do you ever get lonely?

522
00:28:12,135 --> 00:28:13,168
Yeah, sometimes.

523
00:28:13,236 --> 00:28:16,471
So do you think you'll be okay when
I go off to training camp this season?

524
00:28:16,522 --> 00:28:18,506
Yeah, I guess.

525
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:20,559
I like it better when you're home, though.

526
00:28:20,643 --> 00:28:22,895
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Sure. What?

527
00:28:23,997 --> 00:28:26,281
Well, even though she
doesn't show it all the time,

528
00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:28,884
deep down inside, your
mom is still very sad

529
00:28:28,952 --> 00:28:30,252
that your grandma died.

530
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:32,537
Yeah.

531
00:28:32,622 --> 00:28:35,857
So when I'm away, I need you
to just watch out for her,

532
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:37,960
make sure she doesn't get too sad.

533
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,411
Yeah.

534
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:41,280
I need you to be the man
of the house when I'm gone.

535
00:28:41,347 --> 00:28:43,002
Can you do that for me?

536
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:44,600
Yeah.

537
00:28:44,677 --> 00:28:47,336
Okay. I knew I could count on you.

538
00:28:47,387 --> 00:28:49,338
Mom's gonna be okay, right?

539
00:28:49,389 --> 00:28:51,056
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

540
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,010
And besides, now we'll
both be taking care of her.

541
00:28:56,148 --> 00:28:56,812
All right?

542
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,884
Hands off, girlie. That one's mine.

543
00:29:03,464 --> 00:29:04,720
How you holding up?

544
00:29:04,787 --> 00:29:06,072
I'm good.

545
00:29:06,555 --> 00:29:07,739
I know it must be hard.

546
00:29:07,807 --> 00:29:09,724
Your mom played a big part in this night.

547
00:29:09,776 --> 00:29:14,012
Yeah, it is, but, you know,
I think Jamie really helps.

548
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,747
It's kind of life's little plan, you know?

549
00:29:15,832 --> 00:29:17,616
You have kids so you have
something to hold onto

550
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,617
when you lose your parents.

551
00:29:21,838 --> 00:29:23,305
What's wrong?

552
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:27,009
I can't have kids.

553
00:29:28,294 --> 00:29:29,417
What?

554
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:32,097
Have you seen a specialist or... ?

555
00:29:32,181 --> 00:29:34,261
Yeah, no, I did everything, and... 

556
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:36,805
kids aren't in the cards for me.

557
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,215
You cannot give up, Brooke.

558
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,754
You never know.

559
00:29:45,194 --> 00:29:46,895
So, what are our options?

560
00:29:46,946 --> 00:29:48,196
It's a tough call.

561
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:53,235
If we do nothing, it could hurt the
film, but $1 million is a lot of money.

562
00:29:53,286 --> 00:29:55,370
If it helps, I'm willing
to take one for the team.

563
00:29:55,438 --> 00:29:56,538
You can release the tape.

564
00:29:56,605 --> 00:29:57,823
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

565
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,994
And if the tape does get out?

566
00:30:02,498 --> 00:30:05,388
We just finished making a
charming independent movie.

567
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:08,555
For it to work, we need to take
it to a major film festival.

568
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:12,371
We need people focusing on your
great film, Julian, not a sex tape.

569
00:30:12,438 --> 00:30:14,756
This whole thing could
really hurt our chances.

570
00:30:14,807 --> 00:30:16,675
I have a really good friend
who works at Sundance.

571
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:17,726
I could... 

572
00:30:17,793 --> 00:30:18,788
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

573
00:30:22,765 --> 00:30:25,545
Whoever's blackmailing us,
they're right about one thing... 

574
00:30:26,302 --> 00:30:27,953
we have everything on the line.

575
00:30:28,021 --> 00:30:30,789
Well, they're also right
about something else.

576
00:30:30,857 --> 00:30:32,307
I want to protect Alex.

577
00:30:32,896 --> 00:30:34,242
She's fragile.

578
00:30:34,736 --> 00:30:36,306
And if this tape gets out... 

579
00:30:37,985 --> 00:30:39,386
It could destroy her.

580
00:30:43,819 --> 00:30:47,781
Well, now it looks like we have
$3 million invested in this film.

581
00:30:59,852 --> 00:31:01,253
Look, we got to tell Brooke, all right?

582
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,722
She's got no idea, and I
don't think us being together

583
00:31:03,806 --> 00:31:04,890
is gonna strike her as a good surprise.

584
00:31:04,974 --> 00:31:06,391
Now is not a good time.

585
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:08,927
We're on the verge of
releasing a very important line,

586
00:31:08,995 --> 00:31:11,413
and I need her thinking
about business and not us.

587
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:13,198
Hey... 

588
00:31:13,282 --> 00:31:14,950
You're ashamed of us, aren't you?

589
00:31:15,017 --> 00:31:16,068
Please.

590
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:17,886
- You are.
- Please!

591
00:31:17,954 --> 00:31:19,905
I am not.

592
00:31:19,989 --> 00:31:22,557
Look, I told Brooke I was taking a lover.

593
00:31:23,543 --> 00:31:26,078
Where's the shame in it
being a young, hot guy

594
00:31:26,162 --> 00:31:28,497
who's 25 years younger than me

595
00:31:28,548 --> 00:31:31,503
who has abs that I can
bounce quarters off of, Hmm?

596
00:31:32,301 --> 00:31:34,269
You just need to relax.

597
00:31:34,337 --> 00:31:36,204
You need to relax.

598
00:31:36,255 --> 00:31:39,040
Nobody's ashamed of anybody, okay?

599
00:31:42,328 --> 00:31:45,313
And then she said there was someone else.

600
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:47,549
Dude, that sucks.

601
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,851
Yeah, but I just don't know
who that someone else could... 

602
00:32:02,782 --> 00:32:03,865
It's you, isn't it?

603
00:32:06,235 --> 00:32:07,919
Lauren's "someone else."

604
00:32:08,004 --> 00:32:09,671
Skills, I was gonna talk to you... 

605
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:11,072
so it's true?

606
00:32:11,658 --> 00:32:12,491
Yes, but... 

607
00:32:17,964 --> 00:32:20,682
Thanks for sleeping with
my girlfriend, buddy.

608
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:29,241
That's just scandalous.

609
00:32:29,308 --> 00:32:32,144
Just simply... 

610
00:32:32,228 --> 00:32:34,312
scandalous.

611
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:54,508
Your face says "a shot and a beer back,"

612
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,079
but I think this is what you need.

613
00:32:57,422 --> 00:32:58,929
Someone get their heart broken tonight?

614
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,732
Yeah.

615
00:33:00,925 --> 00:33:02,412
It was my fault, though.

616
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,668
I mean, looking back, I had my chance.

617
00:33:05,629 --> 00:33:07,478
I just didn't take it when I should have.

618
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,329
Now it's too late, and
I'll never get her back.

619
00:33:10,661 --> 00:33:13,805
I don't know. Never is a pretty long time.

620
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,830
I should have just told her how I felt.

621
00:33:39,806 --> 00:33:41,606
Well, all things considered,

622
00:33:41,629 --> 00:33:43,317
I thought that went pretty well.

623
00:33:43,385 --> 00:33:44,284
Um, are you kidding?

624
00:33:44,297 --> 00:33:49,617
A fist fight, public sex, and,
um, a check for you? It rocked!

625
00:33:49,636 --> 00:33:52,051
Whoa. What is this for? I can't take this.

626
00:33:52,056 --> 00:33:53,607
Consider it back rent.

627
00:33:53,692 --> 00:33:55,509
And thanks, Hales.

628
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:57,661
Thanks for being there for me.

629
00:33:57,729 --> 00:33:59,829
That is what sisters are for.

630
00:34:02,231 --> 00:34:04,435
Mom would have loved a night like tonight.

631
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,993
Sometimes I flash on the fact

632
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:08,171
that we're never gonna see her again,

633
00:34:08,197 --> 00:34:08,918
and, uh... 

634
00:34:11,145 --> 00:34:12,226
I can't breathe.

635
00:34:13,604 --> 00:34:14,811
I just can't believe she's gone.

636
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:16,893
I know.

637
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,317
We all miss her.

638
00:34:23,069 --> 00:34:26,336
Just know, Haley, she was so proud of you.

639
00:34:31,364 --> 00:34:32,936
I hope you're proud of yourself, mother.

640
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:36,173
I can't believe that even
you would stoop this low

641
00:34:36,184 --> 00:34:38,575
to sexually harass an employee

642
00:34:38,602 --> 00:34:41,300
to get back at Paul for
standing you up on a date?

643
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:42,429
Brooke... 

644
00:34:45,027 --> 00:34:46,309
I am the date.

645
00:34:46,745 --> 00:34:48,589
We've been seeing each other.

646
00:35:05,713 --> 00:35:08,115
Huh. How was your night?

647
00:35:08,784 --> 00:35:10,434
The best ever.

648
00:35:14,806 --> 00:35:18,358
I don't know where you get
it, but you're a great parent.

649
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:20,415
I get it from you.

650
00:35:22,249 --> 00:35:23,363
You know what I was thinking tonight?

651
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:24,605
What?

652
00:35:26,974 --> 00:35:28,368
I want us to have another baby.

653
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,322
Hales?

654
00:35:32,824 --> 00:35:34,892
I actually took a
pregnancy test this morning.

655
00:35:35,898 --> 00:35:38,274
And it... it was negative.

656
00:35:41,314 --> 00:35:42,194
Okay.

657
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:45,285
Hey, it's fine. We'll... we'll try again.

658
00:35:46,817 --> 00:35:48,689
- You're okay, right?
- I'm fine.

659
00:35:49,152 --> 00:35:49,999
I'm fine.

660
00:35:58,629 --> 00:35:59,622
So you're leaving?

661
00:36:00,818 --> 00:36:03,200
I told you, I don't have a choice.

662
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,108
Marry me.

663
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:13,392
What did you just say?

664
00:36:14,643 --> 00:36:15,766
I said, "marry me."

665
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:17,668
You've got to be joking.

666
00:36:17,735 --> 00:36:18,769
No.

667
00:36:19,313 --> 00:36:21,254
I'm serious.

668
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,740
You made me a promise,
and I'm holding you to it.

669
00:36:27,433 --> 00:36:29,643
Marrying me fixes everything.

670
00:36:32,762 --> 00:36:34,339
All you have to do is say "yes."

671
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:46,724
What do you want?

672
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:48,760
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

673
00:36:49,552 --> 00:36:51,977
I never should have made
that tape, but you got to know

674
00:36:51,986 --> 00:36:54,801
that I never meant for any
of that other stuff to happen.

675
00:36:55,515 --> 00:36:58,378
If there was any way that I
could take it back, I would.

676
00:36:59,531 --> 00:37:00,380
I just... 

677
00:37:00,988 --> 00:37:03,449
hoped you could find it in
your heart to forgive me.

678
00:37:04,419 --> 00:37:05,993
The movie's wrapped, Josh.

679
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,114
And so are we. Goodbye.

680
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,462
Dude, we just said we were
getting the tape out there.

681
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,865
The plan was never to blackmail
these people for money.

682
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:25,303
My girl rocked it tonight.

683
00:37:34,856 --> 00:37:35,751
Thank you.

684
00:37:38,151 --> 00:37:41,089
So, it was some night, huh?

685
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:43,760
You sure you had a good time?

686
00:37:43,786 --> 00:37:45,364
You seemed like something
was bothering you.

687
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,428
Quinn, there's something
I need to tell you.

688
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:53,081
Remember the tennis player that
wouldn't take no for an answer?

689
00:37:53,149 --> 00:37:54,141
Yeah.

690
00:37:54,173 --> 00:37:57,564
Well, she is the girl who
bought my portrait tonight.

691
00:37:58,006 --> 00:37:59,232
That Katie girl?

692
00:38:01,562 --> 00:38:03,682
I... I don't understand.

693
00:38:23,646 --> 00:38:25,028
Wait, you know her?

694
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,884
Why do you have a photo with her?

695
00:38:28,951 --> 00:38:30,209
Because it's not her.

696
00:38:31,404 --> 00:38:32,937
It's Sara.

697
00:38:41,517 --> 00:38:44,103
You showed me something
pretty special tonight.

698
00:38:44,634 --> 00:38:48,353
I'm trying to forget what we were
shown tonight, if you don't mind.

699
00:38:48,421 --> 00:38:49,905
Alex.

700
00:38:49,972 --> 00:38:52,457
Who would have thought
that you, of all people,

701
00:38:52,525 --> 00:38:53,942
would rescue her?

702
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,628
I didn't do anything. You're
the one bailing her out.

703
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:58,129
Thanks to you.

704
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,233
What?

705
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,486
You remember what you said
to me our first night here?

706
00:39:05,271 --> 00:39:06,988
"What if we ruin it?"

707
00:39:07,056 --> 00:39:09,441
Every night I spent away from you,

708
00:39:09,509 --> 00:39:11,743
I dreamed about being back here... 

709
00:39:11,811 --> 00:39:16,597
in this room, in this bed, with you.

710
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,734
I dreamed about us, Brooke.

711
00:39:21,037 --> 00:39:24,005
And now we're here.

712
00:39:24,073 --> 00:39:25,173
We're back.

713
00:39:25,942 --> 00:39:29,578
And you look even more
beautiful than in my dreams.

714
00:39:43,204 --> 00:39:44,801
I love you.

715
00:39:45,511 --> 00:39:47,361
I never stopped loving you... 

716
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:51,094
not for one night, not for one moment.

717
00:39:52,077 --> 00:39:53,469
And I never will.

718
00:39:53,774 --> 00:39:56,452
Nothing can ruin us,

719
00:39:56,813 --> 00:39:57,743
Brooke Davis.
