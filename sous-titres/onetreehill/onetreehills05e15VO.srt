00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,590
Previouslyon "one tree hill".

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,040
I know I sort of freaked you out when you asked me to stay here,

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,870
and,well,there's a reason.

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:07,700
I'm a virgin.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,390
Really?

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,120
Did someone call for a nanny?

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,590
Grandma!

8
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,930
I'll edit the book because I believe in it.

9
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,330
And I believe in you.

10
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,800
But we can't be together.

11
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,680
We will be.

12
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,280
You think about him much?

13
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,750
Lucas.

14
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,530
Every day.

15
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,170
Hey!

16
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,150
I've seen you,okay,outside of the school.

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,530
I've seen you driving past the house,

18
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,050
and now you just happen to be at the hospital?

19
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,160
Nathan,stop.

20
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,540
I was just getting a checkup.

21
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,210
- The truth is,I was hoping ... 
- no,don'T.

22
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,610
Dan,don't hope.

23
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,660
You hear me?

24
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,070
There's no hope for you.

25
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,110
Millicent.

26
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,230
They're giving me a baby.

30
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,500
Okay,it's okay.

31
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,880
Angie,it's okay,sweet girl.

32
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,560
No,don't cry,baby girl.Please!

33
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,140
Don't you want to sleep?

34
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,700
I do,brooke.

35
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,840
Okay,you know I love you,all right?

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,560
And I love baby angie,but I also really,really love my sleep,

37
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,840
and I haven't gotten any in like three nights.

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,400
Yeah,and it shows.

39
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,130
Thanks.

40
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,950
As if I didn't know I look like amy winehouse pre-rehab.

41
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,330
Peyton,I'm sorry.

42
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,120
Okay,she didn't come with instructions,but I will figure it out.

43
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,110
I promise.I promise.

44
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,670
Hey.Hey.Hey.

45
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,330
Come on.

46
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,920
Crying I'm the purple monkey,and I sure wish you'd stop crying.

47
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,080
Hey,baby!

48
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,650
Who wants a pacifier?

49
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,540
Look!

50
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,310
Ooh,who wants a bottle?

51
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,630
You hungry?

52
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,780
Crying continues How about,uh,brooke's boob?Huh?

53
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,960
Hey. Hey.

54
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,240
Look at the dancing animals.

55
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,490
Aren't they funny?

56
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,640
Hey!

57
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,200
Oh,my god,did you think that was funny?

58
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,510
Look!Look!Hey!

59
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,170
No.

60
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,130
No,we like that,remember?It's funny.

61
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,140
Brooke,really?

62
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,350
She's finally sleeping.

63
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,450
I think the crying wore her out.

64
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,440
Hey,I'm sorry about the stuffed-animal thing.

65
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,640
I just ... I was desperate.

66
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,830
It's fine.

67
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,060
But,I mean,do you think angie's illness has something to do with her fussiness?

68
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,740
It's not supposed to.

69
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,530
If I were having heart surgery,I'm pretty sure I'd be a little fussy.

70
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,270
Yeah,but the doctor said her heart condition doesn't even really affect her now.

71
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,820
It's just that,if she doesn't have the surgery,it'll cause big problems later.

72
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,010
For now,she's supposed to be a regular little baby.

73
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,730
Well,she is,and regular little babies cry sometimes.

74
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,390
Sometimes.

75
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,690
Peyton,she cries all the time.

76
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,380
I feel like she doesn't like me.

77
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,520
Oh,no,come on.

78
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,500
She's gonna love you.

79
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,640
You'll see.

80
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,450
Yeah.

81
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,730
This don't look like virgin underwear.

82
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,530
Give me those.

83
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,520
I'm just saying.

84
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,050
If they belonged to my girl,she ain't gonna be no virgin no more.

85
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,180
Dude,shut up.And how do you even know about that?

86
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:40,990
Fergie.

87
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,060
How'd he know?

88
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:42,870
Junk.

89
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,440
You know he tried to get with her,right?

90
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,960
I'm just playing,man.

91
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,840
He overheard you two talking the other night.

92
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,290
You know these walls are thin.

93
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,430
Well,I don't care that she's a virgin.

94
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,970
I actually think it's nice.

95
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,950
Hey,there's something to be said for it.

96
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,890
Knowing exactly where your girl hasn't been,or has been.

97
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,470
That's not what I meant.

98
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,040
Millicent's just pretty amazing.

99
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,660
Dude,you are so whipped.

100
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,960
I mean,I probably would be,too,considering that she 10 times hotter than 
that cougar you was chasing.

101
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,800
So,uh,I thought you were guys were gonna get it together.

102
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,520
You know?

103
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,210
Maybe clean this place up and hold off on the friday-night water fights.

104
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,040
Man,you asking for a whole lot.

105
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,010
I'll tell you what.

106
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,860
Let me have them drawers.

107
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,260
I'm just playing,man.

108
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,190
All right.

109
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,510
Somebody looks older today.

110
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,570
I do!

111
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,870
You?

112
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,230
Why would that be?

113
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,650
It's my birthday,mama!

114
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,190
It is your birthday!

115
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,750
- I'm 5!
- You're 5?

116
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,500
Don't I get my kisses?

117
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,970
Oh,okay.

118
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,650
That's five and one for good luck.

119
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,410
So,what do you want for your birthday?

120
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,110
- I want two things.
- Okay.

121
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,150
I want a wii,and I really want grandpa dan to come to my party.

122
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,040
Knock,knock,knock.

123
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:09,740
Hey.

124
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,000
So,how is my favorite grandson doing on his birthday?

125
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,970
I'm your only grandson.

126
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,010
And a handsome one at that.

127
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,800
So,what does my handsome grandson want for his birthday?

128
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,930
Hello,son.

129
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,400
What do you want?

130
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,900
Do I have to want something to say hello?

131
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,830
Yeah,dad,unfortunately you do.

132
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,070
I'd like to stop by and wish jamie a happy birthday.

133
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,300
It's never gonna happen.

134
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,150
Look,I know I screwed up as a father,but I'd like to be a good grandfather.

135
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,990
Well,you should have thought of that before you killed jamie's great-uncle.

136
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,550
You're not coming to that party,dan,or anywhere near my son.

137
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,250
Yeah,I mean,my office is a disaster right now,

138
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,280
but the recording studio's gonna be really cool when it's done.

139
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,970
How's the tour?

140
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,580
Oh,mia,that's awesome.

141
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,990
Yeah,and your album's selling really well,too.

142
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,590
So you just keep doing your thing and believe in your art,
and we'll all live happily ever after.

143
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,980
So,tell me more about the tour.

144
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,480
- Hey,coach.
- Hey.

145
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,300
What's the status on quentin?

146
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:00,020
Well,if he would channel his stubbornness into his recovery,he'd be fine.

147
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,260
How 'bout your recovery?

148
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,460
What are you talking about?

149
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,390
I just wanted to come by and make sure that you're okay.

150
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,790
Isn't it your son's fifth birthday today?

151
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,790
Oh,that's right.There's lots of mom things you could be doing.

152
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,170
Yeah,there's a friend thing I want to be doing,too.

153
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,660
You know she's gonna be there.

154
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,000
Yes,I know,hales.

155
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,170
You told me at least like six times.

156
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,800
I know lindsey's gonna be at the party.

157
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,350
I'm just saying,if it makes you uncomfortable,I can ask her not to come.

158
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,160
I know,and I love you for it,hales,I do,but the way I see it,

159
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,380
lindsey knows I'm gonna be at the party,and she's choosing to come.

160
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,780
Look,I told her that one day she's gonna come back to me.

161
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,900
Maybe this is that day.

162
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,690
tell me you finished the sketches.

163
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,590
Sketches?

164
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,580
You're kidding,right?

165
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,880
For the macy's presentation.

166
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,120
She hasn't slept in three days,and neither have I.

167
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,850
And she's so cute,but this meeting is huge for "C.Over B.

168
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,170
" Macy's is the larges macy's is the largest department-store chain in america,

169
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,680
and if this doesn't happen,then I've let you down,I've let myself down,

170
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,140
and I've probably somehow let my parents down.

171
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,960
Okay,milly,look at me.

172
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,670
We are gonna be fine.

173
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,250
I'm gonna be complete those sketches.And they're gonna be nothing short of fantastic.

174
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,830
- Really?
- Really.

175
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,920
Under control.

176
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,250
First,tell me something.

177
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,670
How cute do I look with this baby?

178
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,370
Aren't I so angelina?

179
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,550
So angelina.

180
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,360
I know!

181
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,030
Did you hear that,my girl?

182
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,610
Let's say "hi.

183
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,900
" "Hi,aunt milly.

184
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,820
Hi,baby.

185
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,610
How's my baby girl doing?

186
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,660
Busy.

187
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,990
Really?

188
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,240
I thought your little mini-me flew the coop.

189
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,730
Mia?Yeah,she's out on tour,but that doesn't mean my job stops.

190
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,750
Did you know her album is number 2 on itunes?

191
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,080
Yeah,I do,but you ain't on itunes.

192
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,860
You cyber-stalking lucas,right?

193
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,670
Oh,come on.

194
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:59,270
Don't act like you ain't check his facebook profile about 50 times just to see

195
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,060
if he done changed his status from "engaged" to "single.

196
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,520
" You can't fool me,P.Sawyer.

197
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,950
Internet is a dangerous place.

198
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,190
What do you want,skills?

199
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,220
Well,I kind of need help locating jamie's birthday gift,
and you gonna be the girl to help me find it.

200
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,310
Well,I would love to,but ...

201
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,550
no "buts," 'cause you ain't got one.

202
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,550
Both laugh Now,look.

203
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,120
I told nathan I was gonna get this wii,
but that's about as easy to find as willy wonka's little golden ticket.

204
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,440
So we got our work cut out for us.

205
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,050
- Oh,"us," huh?
- Yeah,us.

206
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,660
Now,I'm gonna get the wii,and you gonna get up out this gloomy-ass office.

207
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,180
I was thinking of making the guys pumpkin bread.

208
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,550
I thought it might make them like me m-more.

209
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,260
I don't think I've ever seen the floor of this place.

210
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,010
Did you know your couch was brown?

211
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,750
Did they do this for me?

212
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,680
Because the last thing I want is to be a burden.

213
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,270
No,we've been talking about cleaning the place up for weeks.

214
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,860
So this has nothing to do with me?

215
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,680
Just boys becoming men.

216
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,960
Well,it's kind of nice.

217
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,250
Uh,why don't we go out for lunch?

218
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,810
But we just bought all this food.

219
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,290
Well,then,we'll have a lot to eat later.

220
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,340
guess who I saw this morning.

221
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,390
I have a feeling I'm not gonna like this.

222
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,130
Dan showed up at the gym.

223
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,120
Don't you find it creepy that your dad hangs out around a high-school gym?

224
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,680
He's dan.It's all creepy.

225
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,360
What did he want?

226
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,790
He wanted an invite to jamie's birthday party.

227
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,000
And don't worry,I told him it's not gonna happen.

228
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,400
Well,you're stronger than I am,'cause jamie's been asking me all week

229
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,370
if his grandpa dan's gonna come to his birthday party,

230
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,320
and I have been dodging the subject altogether.

231
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,970
Excellent parenting.

232
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,480
Yeah,thanks.

233
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,930
I don't blame him for wanting to get to know his grandpa.

234
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,760
I just wish his grandpa wasn't dan.

235
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,830
Me too.

236
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,480
We just can't trust him.

237
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,810
I know.

238
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,290
Who can't we trust?

239
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,930
Hey,buddy.

240
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,840
You excited for your birthday party today?

241
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,520
You were talking about grandpa dan,right?

242
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,310
So,can he come?

243
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,620
I'm sorry,jamie.

244
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,250
Grandpa dan's not gonna make it today,okay?

245
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,110
Voil?

246
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,020
One down and a zillion to go.

247
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:36,170
Does this say,"I'm cool,a tad slutty,and well-priced"?

248
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,120
Thank you.

249
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,550
It never gets old hearing how great you are.

250
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,080
What?

251
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,420
What?

252
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,340
No!

253
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,470
We were doing so well!

254
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,580
What?

255
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,690
What is it?

256
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,820
Are you tired?

257
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,080
Are you hungry?

258
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,660
Do you hate my spring line?

259
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,740
What?

260
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,140
Apparently,you're not into feathers.

261
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,300
That's okay.

262
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,220
Man,I can't believe we found this thing.

263
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,020
You seem pretty excited,skills.

264
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,560
Who's the game really for?

265
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:29,630
Well,it's kind of for jamie,and kind of an excuse for me 
to spend a little bit more time at the scott crib.

266
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,640
Excuse?Since when do you need an excuse like a worship to you?

267
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,980
Yeah,it ain't him,though.

268
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,660
It's nathan and haley.

269
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,810
I don't think they really want me around jamie since the whole almost-wedding thing.

270
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:40,540
No.

271
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,450
I mean,that's ... dude,that's crazy.

272
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,070
Nathan and haley love you.

273
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,260
Yeah,but I got they son kidnapped.

274
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,560
It just kind of changed things.

275
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,580
Look,I don't think it's you.

276
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,430
I just think they've been going through a lot lately.

277
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,820
Yeah,but that's naley we talking about,though.

278
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,760
They always be going through a lot.

279
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,810
Well,hey.

280
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,820
I know one thing,and that's ... if you don't ask for something,

281
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,680
you can't just expect for it to happen,you know?

282
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,200
Yeah,you're right.

283
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,150
So,you talk to lucas?

284
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,100
You want him back,don't you?

285
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,610
It doesn't matter what I want.

286
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,260
And,yeah,I did talk to him,and he's clearly in love with lindsey.

287
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,060
Hmm.That's sweet.

288
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,040
And total crap,but,hey.

289
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,560
I just want him to be happy.

290
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,740
What do you think about this one?

291
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,000
Think lindsey will like it?

292
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,790
I think it's just like the other four shirts you tried on.

293
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,590
Yeah,but this one's blue.

294
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,120
Lindsey really loves blue.

295
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,110
The right shirt's not gonna bring her back,luke.

296
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,860
Ah,maybe I'll just try the first one again.

297
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,420
You're my best friend,so I say this out of love.

298
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,840
Hey,look at me.

299
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,180
You got to give lindsey time.

300
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,340
She'll come back if she's ready.

301
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,400
Have you guys been talking much lately?

302
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,380
Yeah,a little bit.

303
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,870
I mean,we e-mail about the book.

304
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,640
Just about the book?

305
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,550
Yeah,she already knows where I stand on everything else.

306
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:28,010
Okay,um,I've been giving you a lot of space because ...

307
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,250
well,because I think I know you pretty well,and I think that's what you need.

308
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,620
But you know that I'm here for you,right?

309
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,800
Yes,haley,I know that.

310
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,020
And I thank you.

311
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,250
But you're friends with lindsey,too,and I don't want to put you in the middle of this.

312
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,620
Okay?

313
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,340
I got to change.

314
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,910
No,no.No.

315
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,010
Yes,I'm friends with lindsey,but you are my best friend,and I love you,

316
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,570
so if you need me,you better put me in the middle ... or else.

317
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,200
This one.

318
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,970
Hi,guys.

319
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,310
How was your day?

320
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:22,620
So,what are we gonna do?

321
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,370
It's a new episode of "tila tequila.

322
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,860
" Did you want to watch something else?

323
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,610
No.

324
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,490
We're cool.

325
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,270
Fergie's a big fan of yoga.

326
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,550
It's actually pilates.

327
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,950
I can change it if you want me to.

328
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,440
Um,actually,we have to go.

329
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,910
We told haley that we'd help her set up for the party.

330
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,140
How dumb is wrapping paper,man?

331
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,470
All you do is rip it off.

332
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,380
Yeah,but how great is it that you got jamie a wii?

333
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,470
I got him legos.

334
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:58,830
Yeah.

335
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,190
What's going on,skills?

336
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,120
I shouldn't have had those beers that day at the wedding,man.

337
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,780
Dude,it wasn't your fault.

338
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,720
Yes,it was,'cause I should have went with him.

339
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,950
Yeah,that nanny shouldn't have fallen off the crazy train.

340
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,660
But what if something bad would have happened to him?

341
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,070
Skills,jamie's fine.

342
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,380
You can't go down that road.

343
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,300
I just want nathan and haley to know I'm sorry.

344
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,600
You know,twon,I think it's pretty great how much you love jamie 
and how good you've been to him,

345
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,650
but something tells me nathan and haley know it,too.

346
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,370
Yeah?

347
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,730
Then how come they don't let me come over no more?

348
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,020
And the crazy nanny's gone,so I know they need help.

349
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,330
Look,I don't blame them.

350
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,430
I just wish I could take it all back.

351
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,090
I just wish they'd forgive me.

352
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,480
They will.

353
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,980
And you just got to forgive yourself.

354
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,200
That is so not cool.

355
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,820
Who ordered the creepy clown?

356
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,010
I did.

357
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,500
He does balloon tricks.

358
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,120
Hiya!It's bucko the clown!

359
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,580
Glad to meet ya!

360
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,870
I always liked clowns.

361
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,330
Besides,look at the size of his feet.

362
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,250
Hey!How's the baby?

363
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,130
Wake her up.I'm leaving her here.

364
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,270
Oh,that bad.

365
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,230
Let's just say i could sleep better at a metallica concert.

366
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,920
But she looks so cute today.

367
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,830
You'll get the hang of it,brooke.

368
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,400
It just takes some practice and learning how to function on no sleep.

369
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,960
We're getting the "no sleep" thing down.

370
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,020
Oh,yeah.

371
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,290
It's just so hard.

372
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:59,960
I'm trying to be patient,but I can't get any work done with her wailing all the time.

373
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,260
Do you have any chicken fingers?!

374
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,150
Do you have an inside voice?

375
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,570
Brooke,we are outside.

376
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,790
No,it's okay.

377
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,030
Ohh.Damn kid.

378
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,240
That's what cute little babies grow up to be.

379
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,110
It's okay.baby

380
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,070
It's okay.

381
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,740
Children talking indistinctly So,you nervous?

382
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,180
About what?

383
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,540
Your face-to-face with your ex-fianc?

384
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,850
She's not my ex-anything.

385
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,040
Well,haley said you tried on like eight shirts today.

386
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,520
It was five.

387
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,350
And that's privileged best-friend information.

388
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,050
Well,I've got the privileged-husband card.

389
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,800
Good point.

390
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,570
You really still think she's the one?

391
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,200
Yeah,I do.

392
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,150
Good.

393
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,430
You boys ready to sing?

394
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,250
You're the singer.

395
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,500
You can't afford me.

396
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,770
All right.

397
00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:05,140
Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday,

398
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:12,900
dear jamie happy birthday to you

399
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,860
Make a wish,jamie

400
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,470
Something you really want.

401
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,220
I know what I want more than anything!

402
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,310
Brooke,peyton.

403
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,200
and deb.

404
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,980
Do,dump,or marry?

405
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,110
I'd marry deb.

406
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,050
I'd much rather do deb.

407
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,320
Keep dreaming.

408
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,710
Whatcha talking about?

409
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,440
I got to take a leak.

410
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,350
Me too.

411
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,100
Do those two do everything together?

412
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,550
Who,dumb and dumber?

413
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:08,680
Yeah,pretty much.

414
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,290
But I love them,though.

415
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,690
Skills,you know,I'm really enjoying living with you guys,
but is everyone okay with me being there?

416
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,730
You really want to know?

417
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,630
Please.

418
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,600
They hate me,right?

419
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,960
Nah,it ain't like that.

420
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,720
It's just that our apartment's always been a guys' crib.

421
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,040
You know,no rules.

422
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:30,470
I mean,we got video games and beer,and sometimes we have these ridiculous water fights.

423
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,790
You know,just guy stuff.

424
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:32,820
I'm killing the fun.

425
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:37,970
I mean,we're trying to clean up our act,but bad habits die hard.

426
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,140
Come on.

427
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,940
Hey,birthday boy.

428
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,630
You want to help me change her?

429
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,860
She's a girl.

430
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,170
That's gross.

431
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,460
Where's owen?

432
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:07,240
Owen was not ready for an emotional relationship that had responsibilities

433
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,610
exceeding those of pouring drinks in a bar.

434
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,770
He didn't like what was under the clothes,did he?

435
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,090
He never got what was under the clothes,thank you very much.

436
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,950
You want to play a game or something?

437
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,530
I'd love to,sweetie,but I'm a little busy with angie right now.

438
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,020
Can we play later?

439
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:30,810
Hey.

440
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,960
You want to know a secret?

441
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,900
You know why I decided to take care of angie?

442
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,850
'Cause of you,buddy.

443
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,210
You showed me how awesome kids are.

444
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,050
You know nobody's ever gonna replace you,right?

445
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,140
Okay.

446
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,990
Now,I've been really busy with this one,
so I haven't had time to get your birthday present,

447
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,190
but I think this year you're old enough to pick out your own.

448
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,540
I am?

449
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,400
I think so.

450
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,430
What do you think of that?

451
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,220
Whoa.That's a lot of zeros.

452
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,700
Yeah,don't spend it all in one place,huh?

453
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,150
Happy birthday.

454
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,140
Who's that?

455
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,480
Who's that?

456
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,110
It's jamie.

457
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,660
I think she likes you.

458
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,540
I grabbed you a corner piece.

459
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,860
with extra frosting.

460
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,720
I was wondering what our first words would be.

461
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,370
Well,it was either that or "I think about you every day.

462
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,480
" Yeah,I'm glad I led with the frosting.

463
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,140
So,how's the book coming,luke?

464
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,030
Good.

465
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,260
Uh,I took your notes on chapter 7,but I'm still not comfortable with the ending.

466
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,960
You'll find it when you're ready.

467
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,890
- So.
- so.

468
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,910
I was thinking I might stop by after the party.

469
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,270
That'd be great.

470
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,600
Hey!

471
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,490
Hey!

472
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,730
There he is.

473
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,480
So,does your party rock or what?

474
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,110
Are you coming home?

475
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,000
Well ... 'cause uncle lucas really misses you.

476
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,460
We're still working on that,buddy,but,uh,thanks.

477
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,780
Now go play with your friends.

478
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,720
Cool!

479
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,880
This is the best birthday ever!

480
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,490
You talk to him?

481
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,500
There's nothing left to say.

482
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,790
There's always something left to say.

483
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,300
Or I don't know.

484
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,910
Maybe you need to just start moving past all this.

485
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,360
I wish it was that easy.

486
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,440
Well,maybe one day you'll wake up and life without lucas ain't that hard to face.

487
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,330
Maybe.

488
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:22,280
But until that day comes,I just want to let you know,I'm rooting for you,P.Sawyer.

489
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,080
You talk to nathan and haley yet?

490
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,980
Oh,well,they was getting some animal balloons made and ... 

491
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,090
you're being a wuss.

492
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,990
Man up,dude.

493
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,450
And if you're not gonna do it for yourself,then do it for jamie.

494
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,940
I'm sure he misses you.

495
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:42,130
Yeah.You too.

496
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,370
It's a rabbit.

497
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:57,280
Well,I was thinking a tiger might be more appropriate.

498
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,850
I'm just getting warmed up.

499
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,380
Very,very impressive.

500
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,780
Excuse me.

501
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,360
Deb.

502
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:22,930
What are you doing here?

503
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,440
Wow,deb,you look.

504
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,660
awful.

505
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,470
And I've barely seen a woman in five years.

506
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,360
You're not coming in.

507
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,530
I just want to wish my grandson a happy birthday.

508
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,480
It'll be a lot happier when you leave.

509
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,140
Come on,deb.

510
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,170
Step aside.

511
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,620
I'll find you a few pills you can pop.

512
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,420
I said no.

513
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,040
Is everything okay?

514
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,530
Who's this clown?

515
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,700
I'm bucko.

516
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,840
Be careful,bucko.

517
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,160
He's done time.

518
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,950
Haven't we all?

519
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,850
Just see that my grandson gets this,bucko.

520
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,000
Hi.

521
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,690
Peyton.

522
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,340
I can't believe jamie's 5.

523
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,950
It's crazy,right?

524
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,900
So,how have you been?

525
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:17,740
Fine.

526
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,910
Well,not really fine.

527
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,440
Let's just say fine.

528
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,010
there's nothing for you to say.

529
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,160
No,there is,okay?

530
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,220
I'm sorry.

531
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:34,520
I'm sorry for the way things turned out,and I'm sorry for the way I treated you,

532
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,630
and I never wanted ... I just.

533
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,430
I'm so sorry.

534
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,700
I can't blame you,peyton.

535
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,440
Please,do.

536
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,580
Blame me,'cause it would make me feel better.

537
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,600
I can'T.

538
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,070
It's not your fault.

539
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,590
Because I could have said "yes.

540
00:26:59,270 --> 00:26:59,980
I know it's a party and all,

541
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,940
but can I talk to you guys for a second?

542
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:02,640
Uh,yeah.

543
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,610
Sure.

544
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,490
I just want to apologize for what happened again at the wedding.

545
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,850
Skills,it wasn't your fault.

546
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,240
Yeah,I know,but you trusted me,and I let you guys down.

547
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,600
Look,I know I should have went to the bathroom with jamie,

548
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,120
and I understand why you don't want me to babysit him no more.

549
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,780
Oh,antwon,that's not it.

550
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,540
It's more about us than it is you.

551
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:27,740
To be honest,we've ... we've been having a hard time just trusting him with anyone lately.

552
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,620
Yeah,but you know I'd give my life for that boy.

553
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,610
We know that.

554
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,290
Jamie's lucky to have you.

555
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,610
So are we.

556
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,420
I promise.

557
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:36,800
Hey,guys.

558
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,330
Uh,jamie's chomping at the bit to open his presents.

559
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,050
wait,wait,wait,wait,wait!

560
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,150
Okay,go ahead.

561
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,330
All right.

562
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,020
Hmm,wonder what it is.

563
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,680
Thanks,uncle lucas.

564
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,280
How'd you know it was from me?

565
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,220
It's a book.

566
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,540
How boring can you get?

567
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,520
Okay,what next?

568
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:17,990
Look,daddy.

569
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,000
It's your number.

570
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,120
It is,huh?

571
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,020
Jame,who gave this to you?

572
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,060
I don't know,mama.

573
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,150
There's no card.

574
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:27,700
All right.

575
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,400
The party turned out fantastic.

576
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,320
Thanks for all your help.

577
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:22,400
Oh,it was my pleasure.

578
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:25,100
Yeah,jamie loves having his grandma around,and so do we.

579
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,610
You have something ... 

580
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,480
- It's not what it look... 
- ah

581
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,310
The less I know,the better.

582
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,560
Add that to my list of clown nightmares.

583
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,900
What's up,little man?

584
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,310
You have a happy birthday?

585
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,370
Get everything you want?

586
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,900
Almost.

587
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,360
Almost?

588
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,550
That ain't good.

589
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,130
What you wish for?

590
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,330
Like,the coolest thing in the world.

591
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,630
Oh,like a hot girl that likes to kiss other hot girls?

592
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,880
No,like a wii.

593
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,960
A wii?

594
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,110
What's that?

595
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,390
Never mind.

596
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:21,940
Well,you still ain't opened my gift yet.

597
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,850
It's a wii!

598
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,000
Thank you,thank you!

599
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,270
It's awesome!

600
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,920
And you ain't think I knew what a wii was.

601
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,020
I'm not that old.

602
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,780
You want to play with me?

603
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,970
I would love to.

604
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,330
Come on.

605
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,980
- Hey.
- Huh?

606
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,460
Does everyone know more about babies than me?

607
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,000
Perks of having a little sister born when you're 18.

608
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,820
How's it going?

609
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,850
It's great ... when she's not hungry or tired or gassy.

610
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,000
Except she's always hungry or tired or gassy so.

611
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:25,030
I remember when lily was born,and she had this thing 
where she wouldn't sleep unless someone was holding her.

612
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,050
Sounds like a lot of girls I know.

613
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,740
You're doing great,brooke.

614
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:37,130
All I can think about is her pre-op appointment with the heart surgeon.

615
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,750
I'm freaking out.

616
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,550
- You want me to come with you?
- No.

617
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,440
You don't have to do that.

618
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:47,230
I know,but.I'd like to.

619
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,870
Okay.

620
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,530
Thanks.

621
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,060
I saw you talking to your runaway bride in there.

622
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,750
Care to give me any spoilers?

623
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:05,580
Uh,you know,I think I'm gonna see how this one plays out 
before I go and write a book about it.

624
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,880
There's my cue.

625
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,350
You're doing great,too,lucas scott.

626
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,670
Hi.Lose your key?

627
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,370
I didn't feel right using it.

628
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,680
You're coming home?

629
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,140
No,luke,it's empty.

630
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,010
I came to get the rest of my things.

631
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,860
Oh,I just thought maybe you were coming back.

632
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,820
Maybe you could just spend the night,you know?

633
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,460
So we could at least talk a little.

634
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,910
What's left to say?

635
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,480
lindsey,I love you.

636
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:22,360
I love you,too,luke,but it takes more than love to build a marriage.

637
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,100
I'm willing to learn.

638
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,100
Whatever it takes to make you come back.

639
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,450
" keep the key.

640
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,380
This is your home.

641
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,080
I didn't know pilates was so ... sensual?

642
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,230
Didn't know you guys were into yoga.

643
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,130
- It's pilates.
- It's pilates.

644
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:42,010
I didn't know pilates was so.

645
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,340
erotic.

646
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,670
So,mouth,where's your girlfriend?

647
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,510
Easy.

648
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:50,150
No,I mean,seriously,where'd she go?

649
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,560
I don't know.She said she had to run out.

650
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,090
And her name's millicent,by the way.

651
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,960
Hi,guys.

652
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,080
Oh,please tell me those are for us.

653
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,410
Milly,what's going on?

654
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,370
Stashed throughout the room,you will find various heavy artillery.

655
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,480
I want you all to consider your next move very carefully.

656
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,030
Come on.

657
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,480
Tell me again how great I'm doing.

658
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,200
Yeah,I know how you feel,kid.

659
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,380
I have to get these sketches done for macy's,and she just won't stop.

660
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,110
Come on in.

661
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,170
So,how was today?

662
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,750
Just like every day.

663
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,440
Well,there's always tomorrow.

664
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,720
Peyton,are you really in love with lucas,or are you just in love with the idea of him?

665
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:17,010
If I'm being honest.

666
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,380
maybe a little bit of both.

667
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,670
I think I miss what i thought we would be.

668
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,060
She adores you,luke.

669
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,530
Well,maybe she can put in a good word for me with lindsey.

670
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,620
It's kind of strange,isn't it?

671
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,450
Is this how you thought our lives would turn out?

672
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,780
Yeah,with me being stood up at the altar and you taking care of a kid that's not yours?

673
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,840
Not exactly.

674
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,770
Do you ever want to go back?

675
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:06,590
I remember being 16,and everything just seemed much easier.

676
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,660
Would you do it differently?

677
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,810
I'd try to appreciate the things I took for granted.

678
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:26,360
But I think we have to go through all this stuff,you know,
to get to the places we want to be.

679
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,020
Yeah.

680
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,960
Well,I should go.

681
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,330
At least if you want to get any sleep tonight.

682
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,520
How are the designs coming?

683
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,060
Good.I just have a few more.

684
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,100
Stay.

685
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,270
And finish them.

686
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,690
I don't mind.

687
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,900
Really?

688
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,200
Yeah,it's kind of nice.

689
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,530
Yeah.

690
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:11,460
Sometimes when you're young,you think nothing can hurt you.

691
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,820
It's like being invincible.

692
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,110
I think it's bedtime for the birthday boy.

693
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,850
One more game.Please?

694
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,850
Yeah,please?

695
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,980
All right,one more game,but then it's off to bed.

696
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,480
your whole life is ahead of you,and you have big plans.

697
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,100
I got you.

698
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,200
Big plans.

699
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,610
To find your perfect match.

700
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,150
Cover me.

701
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,180
1.2.3!

702
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,950
The one that completes you.

703
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:33,110
but as you get older,you realize it's not always that easy.

704
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,880
I told you to stay away from my family.

705
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,340
I know.

706
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,550
Then why did you give jamie my first jersey?

707
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:48,110
I was just sorting through some old stuff,
and I thought your son might appreciate a piece of his father.

708
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,110
This is for you.

709
00:39:55,180 --> 00:40:00,200
It's not until the end of your life that you realize 
how the plans you made were simply plans.

710
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,260
You're giving me the beach house.

711
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,340
We've had some great times here,nathan,before.

712
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,480
before all of it.

713
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,840
Maybe your family will,too.

714
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,280
I don't want it.

715
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,430
I don't want any of it.

716
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,350
Thud Son.

717
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,570
I have a bad heart.

718
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,670
You're just realizing that,dad?

719
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,760
At the end,when you're looking back instead of forward,

720
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,190
It's my hcm, son.

721
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:43,210
you want to believe that you made the most of what life gave you.

722
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,260
I need a heart transplant.

723
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,390
You want to believe that you're leaving something good behind.

724
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,140
I have six months to live.

725

726
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,360
you want it all to have mattered.
