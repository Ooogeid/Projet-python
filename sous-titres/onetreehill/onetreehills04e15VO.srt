1
00:00:00,606 --> 00:00:01,817
Got it. Let's get out of here.

2
00:00:01,847 --> 00:00:04,022
Well, well,
what do we have here?

3
00:00:04,052 --> 00:00:07,575
Principal Turner is just really pissed,
and he's on a major witch-hunt.

4
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:09,597
You're, like,
the prime suspect.

5
00:00:11,931 --> 00:00:13,271
Why would you do that?

6
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:14,593
You're my friend, Brooke.

7
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:19,496
You know I love him,

8
00:00:19,526 --> 00:00:21,991
but I never meant for my
love for him to hurt you.

9
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:22,956
Thank you, Peyton.

10
00:00:22,988 --> 00:00:24,750
I could kiss you forever.

11
00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:28,699
I'm a Clean Teen.
I'm the Clean Teen.

12
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:29,915
This was goodbye.

13
00:00:29,944 --> 00:00:32,401
Chase is into smart,
born-again virgin Brooke,

14
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,081
Not stupid slutty,
"I cheated on the calculus test" Brooke.

15
00:00:35,116 --> 00:00:37,391
I could easily have sex
with him if I wanted to.

16
00:00:37,427 --> 00:00:38,922
Party!

17
00:00:40,476 --> 00:00:42,542
That is for getting me fired.

18
00:00:44,937 --> 00:00:46,051
And that...

19
00:00:46,906 --> 00:00:49,132
is for trying to
sleep with my husband.

20
00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:56,641
Come on,
I can't believe I'm doing this.

21
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,971
I would die if
anybody saw this.

22
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:00,710
Don't worry.
Nobody will ever know.

23
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:26,681
I think the lime
went down my shirt.

24
00:01:26,716 --> 00:01:27,800
I'll get it later.

25
00:01:29,036 --> 00:01:31,282
Thanks, buddy.
Hey, you're next. Get up there.

26
00:01:33,418 --> 00:01:35,563
Hey. Baby, come here.

27
00:01:35,647 --> 00:01:36,901
I need a chaser.

28
00:01:37,505 --> 00:01:39,663
Why don't you spit in
my mouth next time?!

29
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:40,862
It would be sexier!

30
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:42,160
Hey.

31
00:01:43,418 --> 00:01:44,692
What is your problem?

32
00:01:44,725 --> 00:01:47,963
You mean why won't I let you mount me
in front of the entire basketball team

33
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:50,381
after you've already made out
with half the cheerleading squad?

34
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:51,722
Yeah, pretty much.

35
00:01:52,377 --> 00:01:53,693
I am so sick of this.

36
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:56,712
All you care about is
getting drunk and having sex!

37
00:01:56,746 --> 00:01:57,650
Hey!

38
00:01:57,687 --> 00:01:59,111
Hey, you left out basketball.

39
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,173
No, no, I left out that you're
an inconsiderate bastard,

40
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,341
and we are through.

41
00:02:04,376 --> 00:02:06,491
For 10 minutes this time,
or until tomorrow?

42
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:08,232
I need to know how
to plan my night.

43
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:10,002
How does forever work?

44
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:12,632
Now you can go screw
whatever skank you want.

45
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:25,220
I'm drunk.

46
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:26,953
Peyton dumped me.

47
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:42,420
So, you guys really broke up?

48
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,333
Yeah. Do you need
another drink?

49
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:45,492
No.

50
00:02:47,516 --> 00:02:50,463
Whoa. Never mind. You're good.

51
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:07,391
What are you doing?

52
00:03:07,807 --> 00:03:10,323
Oh, just having a little fun.
Don't worry.

53
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:13,133
Just promise you'll erase it.

54
00:03:13,168 --> 00:03:14,190
Done.

55
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:27,063
Hold on.
I can't believe I'm doing this.

56
00:03:27,095 --> 00:03:29,741
I would die if anybody
saw this, Nathan.

57
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,910
Don't worry.
Nobody will ever know.

58
00:03:39,245 --> 00:03:42,221
Peyton, I don't know what to --

59
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:47,003
Transcript : Raceman

www.forom.com

61
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:28,720
Well, it could have been worse.

62
00:04:28,757 --> 00:04:31,680
You could have gotten your ass kicked
by a pregnant girl half your size.

63
00:04:33,198 --> 00:04:34,733
The day is still young.

64
00:04:36,758 --> 00:04:40,382
All right, so I have to ask --
who's really the big brother?

65
00:04:40,707 --> 00:04:41,991
Rachel.

66
00:04:43,396 --> 00:04:46,332
I can't believe I have a
black eye the day of prom.

67
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:49,843
If it wasn't for you, everybody would
be calling me "queen slut" right now.

68
00:04:49,878 --> 00:04:52,931
After I talk to principal Turner,
you might just have the title.

69
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:55,362
I have to get my punishment
for stealing the test.

70
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:57,123
Maybe he'll spank me.

71
00:04:57,157 --> 00:04:59,802
I  wish you'd let me go with you.
I'm the one who was failing.

72
00:04:59,835 --> 00:05:01,031
That's not a good idea.

73
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:03,880
This problem calls for little
clothes and lots of flirting,

74
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,013
and no one wants to flirt
with a one-eyed girl.

75
00:05:06,047 --> 00:05:07,213
No offense.

76
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:09,951
Didn't you see enough
of Brooke last night?

77
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:11,991
Or are you here for
the deleted scenes?

78
00:05:14,695 --> 00:05:16,180
How are you holding up?

79
00:05:17,547 --> 00:05:19,841
I never meant for
it to happen, Luke.

80
00:05:20,527 --> 00:05:25,571
I was just really drunk,
and Peyton broke up with Nathan and...

81
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:29,982
Did I mention I was, like,
really, really drunk?

82
00:05:31,618 --> 00:05:33,280
How mad is she?

83
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,680
She was still pretty upset
when I left her last night.

84
00:05:37,188 --> 00:05:38,553
You think?

85
00:05:39,217 --> 00:05:40,823
Well, it could be worse.

86
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:42,602
You could be Nathan right now.

87
00:05:42,818 --> 00:05:45,321
Haley, please come out.

88
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:52,801
Hey.

89
00:05:54,846 --> 00:05:57,281
Why didn't you tell me
about Brooke, ever?

90
00:05:57,317 --> 00:06:00,631
Really, did you just want
to not ruin the surprise

91
00:06:00,665 --> 00:06:03,282
of me seeing it on tape in
front of our entire class?

92
00:06:03,318 --> 00:06:05,881
No, I didn't tell you because
it happened a long time ago

93
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:07,221
and it didn't mean anything.

94
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:10,030
If it didn't mean anything,
then why did you put it on tape?

95
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:12,401
And why do you keep the tape?

96
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:14,753
Do you, like, use it?

97
00:06:14,787 --> 00:06:17,252
No, I forgot I even had it.

98
00:06:17,296 --> 00:06:20,342
I didn't tell you because it
happened before I met you.

99
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,983
I didn't think it would do
any good to bring up the past.

100
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:28,292
This is just the worst time for
something like this to happen.

101
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:29,753
Because of prom tonight?

102
00:06:30,238 --> 00:06:33,441
Not because of prom,
because I'm pregnant and I'm hormonal.

103
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:34,821
And you know what?
Now that you mention it,

104
00:06:34,856 --> 00:06:37,773
I do have to go help decorate,
because I promised Brooke.

105
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:40,242
-  Haley, I'm really sorry.
- Yeah.

106
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:42,143
Welcome home, Mrs. Scott!

107
00:06:44,797 --> 00:06:47,121
I'm sorry I left
the house like this.

108
00:06:49,128 --> 00:06:51,070
Whatever, mom.
Just clean it up.

109
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,123
Still upset?

110
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:05,473
No, something like that,
you forget about pretty quick.

111
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:08,953
Dumb question, I guess.

112
00:07:08,985 --> 00:07:11,800
Hopefully, the prom will take
your mind off this whole thing.

113
00:07:11,837 --> 00:07:13,251
Yeah, that should be fun.

114
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:15,672
Maybe my cheating ex-boyfriend
will ask me to dance,

115
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,620
or I'll get to share some punch
with my whore of an ex-friend.

116
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:21,542
I know this sucks,
but you shouldn't let it ruin the prom.

117
00:07:21,578 --> 00:07:23,471
No, it shouldn't, but it does.

118
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:25,451
For what it worth,
I saw Brooke this morning,

119
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,032
and she feels
horrible about this.

120
00:07:28,308 --> 00:07:31,732
So, the first thing you did
this morning was go see Brooke?

121
00:07:31,768 --> 00:07:33,352
It was on the way.

122
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,823
You know what else
is on the way?

123
00:07:34,857 --> 00:07:35,943
My front door.

124
00:07:35,978 --> 00:07:37,572
Shut it when you leave.

125
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:07,723
That really did happen?

126
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:10,990
I always kind of pretended
it was just a bad dream.

127
00:08:11,628 --> 00:08:12,803
No, it happened.

128
00:08:13,588 --> 00:08:16,360
I guess it's easier for you to
remember it, since you have a tape

129
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,833
that you can watch over 
and over and over again.

130
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:20,710
I never watched
the tape, Brooke.

131
00:08:20,746 --> 00:08:22,950
I didn't even know
it was still around.

132
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:24,841
I just destroyed
it this morning.

133
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:27,323
Great. That's gonna
help everyone unsee it.

134
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:29,391
I know. I'm sorry.

135
00:08:29,655 --> 00:08:31,893
It's not all your fault, Nate.
I mean,

136
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,762
my memory of that
night's hazy at best,

137
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:37,921
but I'm pretty positive you
didn't have a gun up to my head.

138
00:08:37,957 --> 00:08:39,573
I know it was only
two years ago,

139
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:41,752
but  it just feels like
a different lifetime.

140
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,892
Hey, I know exactly
how you feel.

141
00:08:44,598 --> 00:08:46,872
I'm not proud of who
I used to be either.

142
00:08:46,907 --> 00:08:48,040
God.

143
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:49,950
How's Haley?

144
00:08:50,103 --> 00:08:52,799
I spent the night apologizing
to our bedroom door.

145
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:56,255
When she did come out, it was just to
tell me she had to decorate for prom.

146
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:57,821
Why aren't you there?

147
00:08:57,859 --> 00:09:00,352
Because Haley's there and Peyton's
there, and I'm gonna avoid seeing them

148
00:09:00,387 --> 00:09:02,040
until the last possible second.

149
00:09:04,855 --> 00:09:07,130
All right, well,
I need to go make my rounds.

150
00:09:07,165 --> 00:09:09,250
I've got a lot of
apologizing to do today.

151
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:11,292
Yeah. I'll tell her you came by.

152
00:09:11,326 --> 00:09:13,723
No, don't. Please.

153
00:09:13,757 --> 00:09:14,700
Okay.

154
00:09:14,738 --> 00:09:18,580
Anyway, like I said, I'm sorry.

155
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:19,951
Me too.

156
00:09:21,337 --> 00:09:23,371
I guess when you get drunk
anf have sex at a party

157
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:25,562
you do have to deal
with it eventually.

158
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:28,170
Hey, Shelly, it's Mouth.

159
00:09:28,996 --> 00:09:30,692
Please call me back.

160
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,012
It's, uh -- it's Mouth.

161
00:09:52,807 --> 00:09:54,390
Sorry I'm late.

162
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:56,891
That's what you're
apologizing for?

163
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,550
Well, I'm sorry
about the other thing, too.

164
00:10:00,615 --> 00:10:03,350
Were you ever gonna tell me
about you and Nathan, ever?

165
00:10:03,388 --> 00:10:05,612
Um, honestly, no.

166
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:08,330
Haley, we didn't even know
each other back then.

167
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:11,261
When am I supposed to bring that up --
at a basketball game?

168
00:10:11,296 --> 00:10:14,463
"R-A-V-E-N-S! P.S.:
I slept with your husband once"?

169
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:15,622
I guess.

170
00:10:15,655 --> 00:10:18,692
You really shouldn't be upset.
Nathan used to hook up with everyone.

171
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:19,891
Bev --

172
00:10:23,368 --> 00:10:27,330
Duck, duck, duck, bitch.

173
00:10:28,597 --> 00:10:33,162
Peyton. Peyton, I'm so sorry.
What else do you want me to say?

174
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:36,030
I want you to say, "punch me in
the face again, Peyton, please.

175
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,303
I deserve it."

176
00:10:37,987 --> 00:10:39,032
Okay.

177
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:42,070
You're not exactly
perfect here, either.

178
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:45,083
You cut me out of your life,
made me feel guilty for kissing Lucas

179
00:10:45,116 --> 00:10:47,760
when you had screwed
Nathan behind my back.

180
00:10:47,796 --> 00:10:49,693
And you guys were broken up.

181
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:51,770
Keep telling yourself that
if it makes you feel better.

182
00:10:51,805 --> 00:10:54,161
But you're a backstabbing whore,
and you know it.

183
00:10:54,597 --> 00:10:55,803
Hey.

184
00:10:55,836 --> 00:10:57,872
Good luck with your
cheating girlfriend.

185
00:11:07,357 --> 00:11:10,403
Hey, I just went to school to find you,
and Bevin said you left.

186
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:12,441
Well, Bevin doesn't
know when to shut up.

187
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:13,981
What are you doing?

188
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:15,983
These are all the tapes
that I could find

189
00:11:16,017 --> 00:11:18,560
because the thought of you brooking
yourself to yourself and Brooke

190
00:11:18,598 --> 00:11:19,933
really makes me sick.

191
00:11:19,967 --> 00:11:21,461
Baby, there aren't
any more tapes.

192
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:23,900
Really? Because Bevin says that
you've been with a lot of girls.

193
00:11:23,935 --> 00:11:27,000
So I'm thinking you probably put yourself
on tape with at least one or two of them.

194
00:11:27,037 --> 00:11:28,870
Bevin doesn't know
when to shut up.

195
00:11:33,238 --> 00:11:35,322
Okay, okay,
you know what I want?

196
00:11:35,358 --> 00:11:36,300
Here's what I want.

197
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:39,023
I want a list of every girl
that you've ever been with.

198
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:40,772
That way there won't
be any more surprises.

199
00:11:40,798 --> 00:11:44,793
You want me to write a list of
every single girl I've ev--

200
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:49,351
No, no, I guess not every single girl.
You can cross Peyton, Brooke,

201
00:11:49,386 --> 00:11:51,293
and my sister off of that list.

202
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:52,710
You really think
that's a good idea?

203
00:11:52,747 --> 00:11:55,170
Yes! And here.
I'll make it easy for you.

204
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:57,982
Take the phone book and just
cross off the name of every girl

205
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,342
you haven't been with.

206
00:11:59,378 --> 00:12:01,170
I don't want to do this.

207
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,651
Why? I can give
you mine -- you.

208
00:12:06,718 --> 00:12:07,981
See?

209
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:10,341
That wasn't so hard.

210
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:31,300
Hey, uh... you were right.

211
00:12:31,545 --> 00:12:33,853
I should have checked on you first.
I'm sorry.

212
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,501
It's okay.

213
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:39,081
I like the red dress.

214
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:42,572
You would. It's Brooke's.

215
00:12:44,517 --> 00:12:47,263
- Why do you have it?
- So she doesn't.

216
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:51,821
Okay, don't you think stealing Brooke's
prom dress is going a little bit too far?

217
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:56,330
No, I think going a little too far is
making your friend feel like a whore

218
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:57,702
when you've done worse.

219
00:12:57,738 --> 00:12:59,920
Didn't we kind of do
the same thing to her?

220
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:02,141
We had sex? That's funny.

221
00:13:02,176 --> 00:13:04,022
I don't really remember.
It must not have been very good.

222
00:13:04,056 --> 00:13:08,150
We didn't have sex,
but we did sneak around behind her back.

223
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:11,041
Do you ever actually defend
the person you're dating?

224
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:13,431
Look, Peyton,
I know you're upset,

225
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:15,832
but I also know you
can take the high road.

226
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:17,920
This is complete beneath you.

227
00:13:18,595 --> 00:13:23,433
Like Nathan beneath Brooke,
or was that Brooke beneath Nathan?

228
00:13:31,886 --> 00:13:33,142
Can you hit it?

229
00:13:34,986 --> 00:13:36,160
Hi, Brooke.

230
00:13:36,347 --> 00:13:37,603
Are you okay?

231
00:13:37,996 --> 00:13:39,450
Oh, I don't know.

232
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:42,782
Is it okay that million-dollar
bitchy gave me a black eye

233
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:44,443
the day of my senior prom?

234
00:13:44,476 --> 00:13:45,542
No.

235
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:50,013
Is it okay that Peyton went after Lucas,
not once but twice,

236
00:13:50,045 --> 00:13:51,622
while we were dating?

237
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:52,781
No.

238
00:13:53,105 --> 00:13:58,013
Is it okay that she chased Chase off by
screaming at me in front of everyone?

239
00:13:58,085 --> 00:13:59,712
"Chased Chase."

240
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,081
Why is this funny?

241
00:14:01,117 --> 00:14:02,283
It's not.

242
00:14:02,938 --> 00:14:04,443
Is there anything I can do?

243
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:08,403
Yeah, actually, you could push
Peyton in front of a bus for me.

244
00:14:10,315 --> 00:14:12,011
I'm just gonna go over there.

245
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:23,350
Whoa. Please tell me one of
those dresses isn't Brooke's.

246
00:14:23,388 --> 00:14:26,163
Uh, no, actually.
Dan is chaperoning the prom,

247
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,291
and he's asked me to
chaperone with him.

248
00:14:28,405 --> 00:14:31,151
You want to go to my prom

249
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:34,140
with the guy who left
you right after yours?

250
00:14:34,175 --> 00:14:36,350
Look, we are just
going as friends.

251
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:41,861
Um... what are you doing?

252
00:14:41,895 --> 00:14:43,700
I'm looking for my real mom.

253
00:14:43,737 --> 00:14:46,261
Look, I just thought
it would be fun.

254
00:14:46,295 --> 00:14:50,313
But if this is gonna upset you, I could
just stay home alone another night.

255
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:52,850
I'm used to it.

256
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:54,852
I've done it for 17 years.

257
00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:05,651
What are you doing?

258
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,302
Oh, Nathan,
I didn't hear you come in.

259
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:11,120
It's  no wonder I can't dance.

260
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:13,293
I take it you need something?

261
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:14,870
Yeah, I need to talk to you.

262
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:18,760
I screwed up, and if there's one thing
you know about, it's screwing up.

263
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:20,212
You left out basketball.

264
00:15:20,246 --> 00:15:21,930
Dad, it's pretty bad this time.

265
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:24,071
Daunte bad or failed-test bad?

266
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:27,980
"Me and Brooke made a sex tape a few
years back, and it just got out" bad.

267
00:15:28,016 --> 00:15:30,480
Brooke Davis? Nice.

268
00:15:31,178 --> 00:15:35,152
And now Haley wants me to write a list
of every girl I've ever slept with.

269
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:37,781
Oh no, bad idea.
That would just made the things worse.

270
00:15:37,818 --> 00:15:40,552
Give her some time. She'll calm down.
But do not write that list, Nathan.

271
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:41,863
I wouldn't.

272
00:15:43,228 --> 00:15:44,802
I'll write the list.

273
00:15:47,595 --> 00:15:50,432
Oh, no, no,
I thought that's what you wanted.

274
00:15:50,585 --> 00:15:54,511
No. No.
That's not what I wanted.

275
00:15:54,545 --> 00:15:57,363
I wanted you not to be
able to write a list.

276
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,512
How am I supposed to compete with
all the girls that you've been with?

277
00:16:02,548 --> 00:16:04,163
You don't have to compete
with all the girls.

278
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:07,670
All the girls? How many girls
have you slept with, Fabio?

279
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:09,572
I don't know.
I never thought about it.

280
00:16:09,605 --> 00:16:13,780
Honey, that is why I asked you to
write the list in the first place.

281
00:16:13,818 --> 00:16:17,043
So, please,
just do what I'm asking you to!

282
00:16:27,706 --> 00:16:29,521
- Hi.
- Hey.

283
00:16:29,868 --> 00:16:34,381
Sorry I couldn't talk earlier.
I was just thinking about what happened.

284
00:16:34,418 --> 00:16:35,592
It's okay.

285
00:16:36,007 --> 00:16:38,541
I'm sorry my past keeps
coming back to haunt us.

286
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:42,791
I have a lot of skeletons in my closet, 
and, apparently, half of them are naked.

287
00:16:43,345 --> 00:16:44,393
Yeah.

288
00:16:45,258 --> 00:16:48,142
I've been able to accept a
lot of your history, Brooke.

289
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:50,370
But you know mine, too.

290
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,893
You know that my best friend
slept with my girlfriend,

291
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:54,933
just like you slept with
Peyton's boyfriend.

292
00:16:55,355 --> 00:16:57,450
No, it wasn't like that.
They broke up.

293
00:16:57,488 --> 00:16:59,822
I know prom's important to you,
so we can still go.

294
00:16:59,858 --> 00:17:02,992
But after that,
we can't be together.

295
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:11,711
Um,  then it should
just be over now,

296
00:17:11,745 --> 00:17:16,600
'cause I don't want to go to prom with
someone who doesn't want to be with me.

297
00:17:21,356 --> 00:17:23,312
You said no more surprises.

298
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:25,752
I'm sorry.

299
00:17:31,905 --> 00:17:33,422
Open up, Peyton!

300
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,820
Or what? You'll huff and
puff and blow my house down?

301
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:38,491
Yes! Chase broke up with me.
Are you happy now?

302
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,000
I don't know. Did you tape it?

303
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:42,292
That thing with Nathan and I
happened a long time ago, Peyton,

304
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,642
and you guys were broken up.

305
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:46,733
In case you don't remember,
Nathan and I broke up all the time.

306
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,701
Oh, really? How could I forget?

307
00:17:48,738 --> 00:17:51,121
That's all that your
relationship ever was, Peyton,

308
00:17:51,158 --> 00:17:53,850
just a string of miserable
one-night stands thrown together.

309
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:56,111
Now you're describing your life
with every guy in Tree Hill.

310
00:17:56,148 --> 00:17:59,641
It was one time,
and it meant nothing!

311
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,361
Well, it means
something to Chase,

312
00:18:01,398 --> 00:18:03,202
and it meant something to me.

313
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:04,862
You know what meant
something to me?

314
00:18:04,895 --> 00:18:07,853
You and Lucas having an
ongoing affair behind my back!

315
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:12,020
Because, P.S., we weren't broken up
either time that you went after him!

316
00:18:12,377 --> 00:18:15,670
Okay. All right. My fault.

317
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,692
See, I was stupid,
'cause I thought I ruined our friendship

318
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:20,832
when you ruined it
a long time ago.

319
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,363
We were never friends.

320
00:18:22,396 --> 00:18:24,251
Oh, give me -- Oh!

321
00:18:26,216 --> 00:18:27,340
Hey.

322
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:30,871
You're the next stop on the
Nathan Scott apology tour.

323
00:18:31,305 --> 00:18:33,402
And I thought that
tour was sold out.

324
00:18:34,435 --> 00:18:36,131
Are you pissed about the tape?

325
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:40,682
No, actually, I was relieved to
know it wasn't you and Peyton.

326
00:18:44,235 --> 00:18:46,361
Could it have been
you and Peyton?

327
00:18:46,396 --> 00:18:49,672
If it makes you feel any better, Haley
destroyed every other tape in the house.

328
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,420
She's pretty upset, huh?

329
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:53,913
Well, she's still talking to me,
so that's something.

330
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:55,801
And so are you, so...

331
00:18:56,095 --> 00:18:57,460
does that mean we're cool?

332
00:18:57,496 --> 00:18:59,152
Oh, yeah, man. We're cool.

333
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:01,020
I already knew you 
were an ass back then.

334
00:19:02,377 --> 00:19:04,533
Oh, you know what?
Speaking of...

335
00:19:05,585 --> 00:19:08,561
Our dad asked my mom to prom.

336
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,871
That explains the dancing.

337
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:12,582
Does she want to go?

338
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:13,851
Yeah.

339
00:19:14,145 --> 00:19:15,892
It's a bad idea, right?

340
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:17,992
Well, six months ago,
I would have said, "hell, yeah,"

341
00:19:18,027 --> 00:19:20,292
but  now I'm not so sure.

342
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,582
Why? What's changed?

343
00:19:21,615 --> 00:19:23,042
Dan has.

344
00:19:23,086 --> 00:19:24,762
He took the blame for Daunte.

345
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:27,663
He was willing to spend the rest of his
life in jail for something he didn't do.

346
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:30,192
Does that change everything
he's done in the past?

347
00:19:30,227 --> 00:19:32,182
No, it doesn't.

348
00:19:32,217 --> 00:19:35,321
But if your mom was willing
to give him a second chance,

349
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:37,710
then maybe you should, too.

350
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,870
Well, I've got a lot of other
people to apologize to, so...

351
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:42,982
Yeah.

352
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:46,801
Hey. Your mom's
pretty smart, Luke.

353
00:19:46,927 --> 00:19:48,581
And besides, it's her life.

354
00:19:56,606 --> 00:20:00,083
Man, you can't just leave a message about
not going to prom and just hang up.

355
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,062
If Shelly's not going,
I'm not going, either.

356
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:04,382
Look, dawg,
I'm sorry about Shelly, man.

357
00:20:04,418 --> 00:20:05,772
But this your last prom.

358
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:07,661
You gonna just let some girl
take that away from you?

359
00:20:07,696 --> 00:20:10,031
She wasn't "some girl."
She was the girl.

360
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:13,383
She was the girl that broke up with you,
which means she wasn't the girl.

361
00:20:13,418 --> 00:20:14,711
This isn't making
me feel any better.

362
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:17,883
I'm not trying to make you feel better.
I'm trying to get you to go to prom.

363
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,140
Look, Fergie and Junk --
they going to prom.

364
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,361
You think they got dates? No.

365
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:25,002
I mean, prom ain't got to be
about that, dawg.

366
00:20:25,037 --> 00:20:27,922
Maybe it's about just having
a good time with your friends.

367
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,203
I never want to hear
the word "friend" again.

368
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:32,403
At my funeral,
my tombstone will probably read,

369
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:34,673
"Marvin McFadden -- Friend."

370
00:20:35,586 --> 00:20:38,923
Yeah, and that place is probably gonna
be packed, 'cause everybody love you.

371
00:20:40,257 --> 00:20:43,042
Besides, it's
probably better than

372
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,652
"Here lies Mouth.
The guy was a jackass."

373
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,023
You going to prom, man.

374
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:57,752
What's up? Is this how
bag ladies get their start?

375
00:20:57,787 --> 00:20:59,071
Shut it, squeaks.

376
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:01,360
Thanks to Peyton,
Chase broke up with me.

377
00:21:01,398 --> 00:21:03,113
So it's her fault now?

378
00:21:03,147 --> 00:21:06,011
Didn't you "F" her B.F.
when you two were B.F.F.s?

379
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:07,632
They were broken up.

380
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,512
Maybe Chase just doesn't
want to go to prom

381
00:21:09,546 --> 00:21:11,180
with someone who looks
tougher than him.

382
00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:14,050
Oh no, he said prom had nothing to do
with it. He said he'd still go with me,

383
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:15,711
but when it was over,
so were we.

384
00:21:15,746 --> 00:21:17,072
Sounds like Cinderella,

385
00:21:17,107 --> 00:21:19,841
except the prince is a
virgin and the pumpkin is...

386
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,580
a fatter pumpkin.

387
00:21:21,618 --> 00:21:23,921
Yeah? Which evil
stepsister are you?

388
00:21:27,116 --> 00:21:28,911
The one that got expelled.

389
00:21:29,927 --> 00:21:33,282
And FYI,
I think Turner might be gay.

390
00:21:40,937 --> 00:21:42,510
Looking to get revenge?

391
00:21:42,738 --> 00:21:46,231
No. Ew.
I'm just cleaning up around here.

392
00:21:46,268 --> 00:21:48,471
This place seems
dirtier somehow.

393
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,143
Ah, remember when we thought how
cool it would be to hang out

394
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,532
with the popular kids?

395
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:55,132
I don't think I ever said that,
Mr. Lucas Sawyer.

396
00:21:55,215 --> 00:21:57,392
Somebody wrote that
on my notebook.

397
00:21:57,428 --> 00:21:59,631
Oh, okay. How's Peyton?

398
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:01,572
Not well.

399
00:22:02,495 --> 00:22:05,382
I don't get it.
You know, it's been two years.

400
00:22:05,418 --> 00:22:07,400
She's acting like
it just happened.

401
00:22:07,438 --> 00:22:10,500
Luke, she just found out about it.
For her, it did just happen.

402
00:22:10,536 --> 00:22:12,172
Still, she shouldn't
be this upset.

403
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:15,301
Luke, it sucks to be betrayed
by somebody that you love,

404
00:22:15,338 --> 00:22:18,392
but then to find out about it in front
of everybody is really humiliating.

405
00:22:18,428 --> 00:22:19,942
You need to be nice to her.

406
00:22:20,156 --> 00:22:22,821
Whoa. Who says
I'm not being nice?

407
00:22:22,857 --> 00:22:25,652
However nice you're being,
it's not enough.

408
00:22:25,686 --> 00:22:27,213
You've got to let her know
that you're there for her

409
00:22:27,247 --> 00:22:30,021
and that you're nothing
like her ex-boyfriend.

410
00:22:30,076 --> 00:22:31,333
Noted.

411
00:22:32,797 --> 00:22:34,413
But for the record,

412
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,780
Nathan's nothing like
her ex-boyfriend, either.

413
00:22:40,015 --> 00:22:41,202
Noted.

414
00:22:46,705 --> 00:22:48,373
I heard you got expelled.

415
00:22:48,818 --> 00:22:49,962
I'm sorry.

416
00:22:49,997 --> 00:22:53,260
My parents are flying me first-class
to meet them on vacation.

417
00:22:53,717 --> 00:22:55,743
I finally get to spend
some time with them.

418
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,821
I just had to get kicked out
of school to do it... again.

419
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:00,382
Maybe that's why you do it.

420
00:23:01,395 --> 00:23:03,483
Aren't you gonna say
goodbye to everyone?

421
00:23:03,518 --> 00:23:07,341
Yeah, "bye, Haley.
Here's the tutor key I stole.

422
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:11,243
Bye, Nathan. Sorry for almost
getting your uncle killed.

423
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:14,630
Bye, Lucas. Sorry for actually
getting your uncle killed.

424
00:23:14,665 --> 00:23:16,820
And, bye, Tree Hill High.

425
00:23:16,858 --> 00:23:19,533
I'm really sorry about the
whole time-capsule thing."

426
00:23:19,796 --> 00:23:22,600
No, I think I'll spare
everyone the goodbyes.

427
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,173
When do you leave?

428
00:23:25,265 --> 00:23:26,923
I'm booked on a flight tonight.

429
00:23:27,085 --> 00:23:28,583
So you won't be at prom?

430
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,010
Don't look so sad.

431
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,493
You'll barely notice I'm gone when you're
dancing with your hot new girlfriend.

432
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,772
She broke up with me.

433
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:37,803
I've always hated her.

434
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:39,790
Are you okay?

435
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:41,100
Not really.

436
00:23:41,805 --> 00:23:44,163
Now I have to go to prom alone.

437
00:23:44,505 --> 00:23:45,861
You won't be there alone.

438
00:23:45,896 --> 00:23:47,992
I told like five guys
I'd go with them.

439
00:23:49,787 --> 00:23:54,040
Still, I -- I would have loved
to dance with you one last time.

440
00:23:54,436 --> 00:23:56,782
I mean, the only dance we ever
had was after the shooting,

441
00:23:56,816 --> 00:23:59,833
and I'd kind of like
to erase that one.

442
00:24:00,736 --> 00:24:02,413
Yeah, I would have liked that.

443
00:24:02,498 --> 00:24:05,903
God knows I haven't left too
many great memories behind.

444
00:24:06,728 --> 00:24:08,432
You left me with some.

445
00:24:15,148 --> 00:24:16,461
Thanks, Mouth.

446
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:18,502
That means a lot.

447
00:24:22,567 --> 00:24:25,130
That Clean Teen girl doesn't
know what she's missing.

448
00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:37,911
Seriously?! You are
egging my house?!

449
00:24:37,948 --> 00:24:39,501
Are you gonna give
my dress back to me?

450
00:24:39,517 --> 00:24:41,011
The guy at the store
told me you had it.

451
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:42,660
Described you down
to your bony ass.

452
00:24:42,695 --> 00:24:44,690
So go naked. Think of all the
time you're gonna save hooking up

453
00:24:44,728 --> 00:24:46,102
with someone else's boyfriend..

454
00:24:46,135 --> 00:24:47,452
You're one to talk.

455
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:49,171
You are one to talk, Peyton.

456
00:24:49,207 --> 00:24:51,380
Okay, so, you said
we were never friends, huh?

457
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:53,192
I never meant anything to you?!

458
00:24:54,098 --> 00:24:56,802
Fine. Want to see
something else?

459
00:24:56,838 --> 00:25:00,430
Here's a picture of you
and Lucas on my birthday!

460
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:02,340
So who's the whore now?!

461
00:25:07,535 --> 00:25:09,673
God! Stop!

462
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:14,270
Quit it! Stop it!

463
00:25:18,045 --> 00:25:20,840
God, stop! Just let go!

464
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:24,053
I'm the one with no boyfriend,
no prom dress, and a black eye!

465
00:25:24,085 --> 00:25:27,121
You're going to prom with
the guy you love, so you win!

466
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,032
Okay, Peyton, you win!

467
00:25:35,455 --> 00:25:37,680
Why do you even care anymore?!

468
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:42,243
Why do I care?

469
00:25:43,515 --> 00:25:46,960
Brooke, this has been one of
the worst years of my life.

470
00:25:47,466 --> 00:25:49,960
And I needed my best
friend more than ever,

471
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:53,980
and you cut me out because
I was honest with you!

472
00:25:54,035 --> 00:25:57,081
And you were never,
ever honest with me.

473
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:00,691
You made fun of my
mom's death, Brooke.

474
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:04,801
You knew her.
You cried with me when she died.

475
00:26:04,836 --> 00:26:10,551
And now you use her as a punch
line for a joke to hurt me.

476
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:15,743
It hurt. It did.

477
00:26:17,586 --> 00:26:20,321
Not anymore, 'cause you and me --
we're done.

478
00:26:22,107 --> 00:26:24,210
You were right. She's dead.

479
00:26:24,957 --> 00:26:27,360
As far as I'm concerned,
so are you.

480
00:26:39,107 --> 00:26:41,312
- Hi.
- Hi.

481
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:45,022
Can we just put this
whole thing behind us

482
00:26:45,657 --> 00:26:47,470
and have a good time at prom?

483
00:26:48,027 --> 00:26:49,633
I'm not going.

484
00:26:50,926 --> 00:26:53,392
Why? Did something else happen?

485
00:26:53,428 --> 00:26:56,773
No, I just don't
care about prom.

486
00:26:57,038 --> 00:26:58,243
Peyton,

487
00:26:59,186 --> 00:27:01,150
we don't have to see Brooke.

488
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:04,363
It will be fun.
I promise you that.

489
00:27:04,396 --> 00:27:07,670
It's not about Brooke.
I just really don't want to go anymore.

490
00:27:08,445 --> 00:27:10,460
You can still go if you want.

491
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:13,403
Look, I...

492
00:27:14,196 --> 00:27:16,770
I think you're gonna
regret not going.

493
00:27:17,006 --> 00:27:19,961
I know I'll regret
not going with you.

494
00:27:19,996 --> 00:27:21,421
I just can't.

495
00:27:21,786 --> 00:27:23,271
I'm sorry.

496
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:29,643
Well, I really hope
you change your mind,

497
00:27:30,957 --> 00:27:33,573
because I'm coming back later,
and I'm picking you up.

498
00:27:35,516 --> 00:27:37,573
And if you open that door,

499
00:27:38,435 --> 00:27:40,550
I know you're gonna
look beautiful.

500
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:44,261
And then we're gonna
have a great night.

501
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:49,142
And if not,
I guess I'm going alone.

502
00:28:03,188 --> 00:28:04,621
Here's the list.

503
00:28:04,796 --> 00:28:07,273
But it's not the list of every
girl I've ever been with.

504
00:28:07,308 --> 00:28:08,330
Then what is it?

505
00:28:08,368 --> 00:28:10,962
It's the list of every girl
I've ever been in love with,

506
00:28:10,998 --> 00:28:12,560
and your name's
the only one on it.

507
00:28:12,598 --> 00:28:13,710
It's the only one that matters.

508
00:28:13,747 --> 00:28:14,511
Nathan...

509
00:28:14,547 --> 00:28:18,571
That other list would have just been
garbage from a person I'm not proud of.

510
00:28:21,347 --> 00:28:22,980
That's really sweet.

511
00:28:24,318 --> 00:28:25,200
But...

512
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:28,122
But you want the other list.

513
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:32,561
I thought you might.

514
00:28:42,127 --> 00:28:45,371
Wow, you're actually leaving.
I guess I should be packing, too.

515
00:28:45,646 --> 00:28:47,480
Why? I didn't invite you.

516
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,181
No, because this is your house.

517
00:28:51,935 --> 00:28:53,822
This is your house, isn't it?

518
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:57,131
You didn't, like, marry and kill some
old guy and bury him in the basement?

519
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,171
I wish.

520
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:02,243
My parents won't be back for a while,
so you have some time.

521
00:29:02,487 --> 00:29:05,943
I feel really guilty you got
expelled for something I did.

522
00:29:06,188 --> 00:29:09,001
Please. I practically
forced you to cheat.

523
00:29:09,035 --> 00:29:12,922
Besides, for me,
getting expelled equals getting tan.

524
00:29:12,977 --> 00:29:16,051
You had more to lose with
your Clothes Over Bros deal.

525
00:29:17,727 --> 00:29:19,193
Thank you, Rachel.

526
00:29:21,317 --> 00:29:25,200
I don't know why you did it,
but thank you.

527
00:29:25,238 --> 00:29:27,080
I did it 'cause
you're my friend.

528
00:29:27,655 --> 00:29:31,413
Now, do something for me and
make things right with Peyton.

529
00:29:31,706 --> 00:29:33,803
Yeah, but she said
I was dead to her.

530
00:29:33,835 --> 00:29:35,321
Do you blame her?

531
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:37,021
You're wrong, and you know it.

532
00:29:37,055 --> 00:29:39,252
- You slept with her boyfriend...
- They were broken up!

533
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,031
...who, broken up or not,
is off limits.

534
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:45,003
But then you wouldn't forgive her
for doing the same thing to you.

535
00:29:45,037 --> 00:29:46,211
Well, fine.

536
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:48,662
If that's not the skank
calling the whore a slut.

537
00:29:48,697 --> 00:29:51,192
You hit on Nathan
knowing he was married.

538
00:29:51,226 --> 00:29:53,373
I know. But I suck.

539
00:29:53,406 --> 00:29:54,940
You're better than that.

540
00:29:54,975 --> 00:29:58,043
Work it out. It's no fun being
the girl with no friends.

541
00:29:58,075 --> 00:30:00,733
It's no fun being the girl
without a boyfriend, either.

542
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:02,040
No kidding.

543
00:30:02,617 --> 00:30:04,570
What's with the
Clean Teens, anyway?

544
00:30:04,605 --> 00:30:07,680
I mean, first Shelly dumps Mouth,
then Chase dumps you.

545
00:30:07,718 --> 00:30:09,053
They should have
a new slogan --

546
00:30:09,088 --> 00:30:11,033
"We break hearts, not hymens."

547
00:30:11,068 --> 00:30:13,491
Shelly broke up with Mouth?

548
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:17,932
I saw him this morning.
He didn't say anything.

549
00:30:17,965 --> 00:30:19,673
He probably didn't want to
pile onto your problems

550
00:30:19,705 --> 00:30:22,070
the way Peyton piled
onto your face.

551
00:30:22,157 --> 00:30:25,641
But he's pretty
broken up about it.

552
00:30:27,615 --> 00:30:29,012
That's my limo.

553
00:30:32,287 --> 00:30:34,180
Thanks for being my friend.

554
00:30:34,445 --> 00:30:35,953
You cheating whore.

555
00:30:35,987 --> 00:30:38,622
Thanks for being my friend,
you crazy bitch.

556
00:30:40,855 --> 00:30:44,383
Sorry I got you
expelled... again.

557
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:46,882
It's okay. I'm used to it.

558
00:30:49,627 --> 00:30:50,873
Rachel...

559
00:30:54,577 --> 00:30:59,382
Okay, I never thought I'd say this,
but I'm gonna miss you.

560
00:30:59,848 --> 00:31:02,953
Yeah. You too.

561
00:31:32,595 --> 00:31:34,292
I think you should
wear this one.

562
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,892
Listen, I'm sorry I got
weirded out earlier.

563
00:31:38,928 --> 00:31:40,210
That's okay.

564
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:43,152
When he asked me,
that was my initial reaction, too.

565
00:31:43,507 --> 00:31:46,113
And my second and my third.

566
00:31:46,147 --> 00:31:48,121
So, why did you agree to go?

567
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:50,971
I don't know.
I thought it would be fun.

568
00:31:51,006 --> 00:31:52,322
I just --

569
00:31:55,017 --> 00:31:57,351
I just don't want to
see you get hurt.

570
00:31:58,527 --> 00:32:02,803
But if going to prom with...
Dan is gonna make you happy,

571
00:32:02,835 --> 00:32:04,343
then you should go.

572
00:32:04,697 --> 00:32:08,812
You know, there was a small part of me
that was hoping you'd tell me not to go.

573
00:32:09,896 --> 00:32:11,430
I still could.

574
00:32:14,747 --> 00:32:16,172
I'll be fine.

575
00:32:16,847 --> 00:32:17,990
Okay.

576
00:32:22,536 --> 00:32:24,570
But no slow dances, okay?

577
00:32:38,198 --> 00:32:39,352
Did you name him "Nathan"?

578
00:32:39,388 --> 00:32:42,070
Why? Did he screw
my best friend?

579
00:32:42,105 --> 00:32:44,182
I'm sorry, okay?
And I know I'm late.

580
00:32:44,218 --> 00:32:45,632
I should have been
here two years ago.

581
00:32:45,665 --> 00:32:48,290
- Well, why weren't you?!
- Because I was a jerk.

582
00:32:48,865 --> 00:32:50,223
Why Brooke?

583
00:32:50,966 --> 00:32:53,092
Did you really
hate me that much?

584
00:32:53,126 --> 00:32:57,222
No, I didn't hate you. I just didn't
care about anybody but myself.

585
00:32:57,528 --> 00:32:59,973
Look, I hooked up with
Brooke because she was drunk

586
00:33:00,007 --> 00:33:02,590
and I was a bastard.
It didn't mean anything.

587
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:05,100
It was just a mistake we
both wanted to forget.

588
00:33:05,135 --> 00:33:06,733
That explains why you taped it.

589
00:33:06,766 --> 00:33:08,852
Did I mention
I was a stupid jerk?

590
00:33:10,428 --> 00:33:13,013
- Look, when you get to prom --
- I'm not going.

591
00:33:15,378 --> 00:33:18,733
Hey, I know you're mad at me and Brooke,
but don't take this out on Lucas.

592
00:33:18,765 --> 00:33:21,153
I'm not. I just don't care.

593
00:33:21,187 --> 00:33:22,931
I'm you two years ago.

594
00:33:24,156 --> 00:33:27,181
No, you're not. You never were.

595
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:30,851
Why do you think you stayed with
me when I treated you so bad?

596
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:32,140
I'm a masochist.

597
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:34,962
Because you cared.
That's who you are.

598
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:38,080
You care about Lucas because
you know he loves you,

599
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:40,642
and you probably still
care about me and Brooke

600
00:33:40,677 --> 00:33:42,632
because you know
we love you, too.

601
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:45,631
Just face it, Peyton. You care.

602
00:33:46,595 --> 00:33:49,153
So get dressed
and go with Lucas.

603
00:33:49,977 --> 00:33:51,413
I'll see you there.

604
00:34:20,807 --> 00:34:22,880
It looks like you made
the right call, Mouth.

605
00:34:24,137 --> 00:34:25,201
I guess so.

606
00:34:25,685 --> 00:34:28,391
But I always thought I would lose
my virginity to my prom date,

607
00:34:28,426 --> 00:34:30,770
not my prom date
to my virginity.

608
00:34:31,587 --> 00:34:33,820
But at least I have
my friends, right?

609
00:34:43,745 --> 00:34:46,493
Will you go to prom with me,
Marvin McFadden?

610
00:34:47,308 --> 00:34:48,783
What about Chase?

611
00:34:48,818 --> 00:34:50,812
Man, don't ask
about Chase, fool.

612
00:34:55,108 --> 00:34:57,370
Clean Teen isn't really for me.

613
00:34:58,855 --> 00:35:00,650
Of course I'll go with you.

614
00:35:01,577 --> 00:35:04,000
It looks like we'll be
a not-so-clean couple.

615
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:07,402
See, Mouth,
being a friend sometimes pays off.

616
00:35:07,877 --> 00:35:09,872
Who says we're
going as friends?

617
00:35:10,248 --> 00:35:11,903
Just go with it.

618
00:35:12,555 --> 00:35:14,141
See you guys there.

619
00:35:20,307 --> 00:35:21,932
What's he got that I don't?

620
00:35:21,965 --> 00:35:23,473
A date.

621
00:35:35,696 --> 00:35:36,820
Haley?

622
00:35:37,247 --> 00:35:38,823
- Hi.
- Hi.

623
00:35:38,905 --> 00:35:41,523
I just wanted to thank you
for agreeing to move in.

624
00:35:41,657 --> 00:35:42,953
That means a lot to me.

625
00:35:42,985 --> 00:35:46,062
Yeah, sure.
I mean, you know, you're family, Deb.

626
00:35:46,098 --> 00:35:48,190
If you want to get better,
we are here to help.

627
00:35:49,657 --> 00:35:52,843
I also wanted to
tell you that...

628
00:35:53,198 --> 00:35:55,902
whatever stupid thing
Nathan might have done,

629
00:35:55,935 --> 00:35:58,052
I'm possibly to blame for it.

630
00:35:58,655 --> 00:36:00,853
Trust me,
this one is all Nathan.

631
00:36:00,887 --> 00:36:05,160
His only role models growing up
were a spineless, alcoholic mother

632
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:07,623
and a controlling,
sociopathic father.

633
00:36:07,658 --> 00:36:10,313
That doesn't excuse everything
that he does, though.

634
00:36:10,346 --> 00:36:12,010
No, of course not.

635
00:36:12,225 --> 00:36:15,161
But he's become
a wonderful man.

636
00:36:15,197 --> 00:36:16,943
And it's all because of you.

637
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:19,270
And I want to
thank you for that

638
00:36:19,306 --> 00:36:21,893
and ask you to forgive
his shortcomings.

639
00:36:22,685 --> 00:36:25,553
Whatever grace he has,
he learned from you.

640
00:36:26,598 --> 00:36:28,470
Maybe you can return it.

641
00:36:32,787 --> 00:36:34,370
Have fun tonight.

642
00:36:45,277 --> 00:36:47,011
My mother will be
out in a second.

643
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:50,113
I know this is tough for you,
Lucas, but you can trust me.

644
00:36:50,148 --> 00:36:51,592
I trust her.

645
00:36:54,226 --> 00:36:56,660
- Wow, you look beautiful.
- You look great.

646
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:59,220
Well, thank you, both of you.

647
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:01,143
Uh, you're not ready yet.

648
00:37:01,176 --> 00:37:04,510
Oh, well, only old people
go to prom early, mom.

649
00:37:04,547 --> 00:37:06,883
Well, save your mom a dance,
would you?

650
00:37:07,336 --> 00:37:10,683
Sure, 'cause every kid wants
to dance with his mom at prom.

651
00:37:10,716 --> 00:37:13,373
You're not every kid.
You're my kid.

652
00:37:16,825 --> 00:37:18,752
Have a good time at prom, mom.

653
00:37:19,728 --> 00:37:21,161
Dad.

654
00:37:35,627 --> 00:37:36,940
Thank God.

655
00:37:37,858 --> 00:37:39,350
You look amazing.

656
00:37:39,387 --> 00:37:40,622
Thanks.

657
00:37:42,898 --> 00:37:44,642
Notice anything different?

658
00:37:45,036 --> 00:37:46,540
You're smiling.

659
00:37:48,195 --> 00:37:50,611
Anything else?

660
00:37:50,646 --> 00:37:52,451
Your -- your boot's off.

661
00:37:52,626 --> 00:37:54,840
Haley, that's great.
You can walk on it?

662
00:37:54,877 --> 00:37:57,472
Yep. Even better,
I'm gonna dance on it.

663
00:37:58,726 --> 00:38:01,800
I was gonna tell you last night,
but your surprise kind of trumped mine.

664
00:38:01,837 --> 00:38:03,430
Sorry... again.

665
00:38:03,466 --> 00:38:04,600
I know.

666
00:38:05,546 --> 00:38:06,971
And the list?

667
00:38:07,397 --> 00:38:09,042
Uh, the list --

668
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:14,191
I just read the one written by
the man I fell in love with.

669
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,680
I didn't need the one
written by that other boy.

670
00:38:20,315 --> 00:38:22,162
Do you know how
much I love you?

671
00:38:22,276 --> 00:38:23,840
You better.

672
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,513
- We're gonna be late for prom.
- Oh, please,

673
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:38,822
there's nothing wrong with
being a little late, is there?

674
00:38:52,387 --> 00:38:55,661
Oh, hey, does this dress
make my butt look big?

675
00:38:55,995 --> 00:38:57,802
Oh, yeah.

676
00:38:58,326 --> 00:38:59,661
Thanks, baby.

677
00:39:00,437 --> 00:39:02,793
Don't walk with me, dude.
People are gonna think we're together.

678
00:39:02,825 --> 00:39:05,291
Please, you could never
get with Fergalicious.

679
00:39:05,457 --> 00:39:07,092
Did you just say...?

680
00:39:07,128 --> 00:39:08,243
Yeah.

681
00:39:08,707 --> 00:39:10,113
It was really awful.

682
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:13,323
Peyton looked through me
like I didn't even exist.

683
00:39:13,576 --> 00:39:17,830
I mean, can't she hate me? At least
if she hates me, she still cares.

684
00:39:17,865 --> 00:39:19,781
You guys have been friends
longer than me and Luke.

685
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:22,363
I mean,
that's too long not to care.

686
00:39:22,548 --> 00:39:25,602
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I'm always venting to you, Mouth.

687
00:39:25,636 --> 00:39:27,092
Do you want to
talk about Shelly?

688
00:39:27,127 --> 00:39:28,633
Not at all. No.

689
00:39:28,668 --> 00:39:29,912
Okay.

690
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,771
If you do, I'm here.

691
00:39:32,478 --> 00:39:34,720
Thanks again for being my date.

692
00:39:35,037 --> 00:39:37,310
You've always been
there for me.

693
00:39:37,635 --> 00:39:40,101
Even now, when everyone
thinks that I'm a whore.

694
00:39:40,236 --> 00:39:41,890
Nobody thinks that.

695
00:39:46,865 --> 00:39:48,532
Oh, my God.

696
00:39:48,567 --> 00:39:51,160
You might want to step
out of the black light.

697
00:39:53,195 --> 00:39:55,052
She cares.

698
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:57,701
She cares!

699
00:40:03,555 --> 00:40:06,203
Oh, you two look so cute.

700
00:40:06,236 --> 00:40:08,541
Wait there while I get
the video camera.

701
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,913
Sorry. Are you okay with this?

702
00:40:10,948 --> 00:40:12,973
I so broke that camera.

703
00:41:23,585 --> 00:41:24,842
Lucas --

704
00:41:30,316 --> 00:41:31,730
Hi, Peyton.
