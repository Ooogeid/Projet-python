Previously on One Tree Hill

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,410
Do you know what's missing?

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,960
Sketches for my new line.

4
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,270
The attack -- it was my fault.

5
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,730
Has sam been in here tonight?

6
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,190
She left, and I let her go,
and I shouldn't have.

7
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,960
Sam,this is my brother, "X."

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,240
Have a nice night.

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,360
It doesn't mean anything.

10
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,810
It means everything.

11
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,470
I haven't had a drink in over eight yearS.

12
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,990
Tonight, that's gonna change.

13
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,340
I haven't had sex in over 22 years.

14
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,050
And tonight  that's gonna change.

15
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,750
I'm trying out as a point guard.

16
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,190
What's next is the phone's gonna ring,

17
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,930
and the answer is either gonna be a yes or a no.

18
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,320
It's going to be a yes.

19
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,520
You need to convince lucas to do the movie.

20
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,530
And you'll make it the movie he wants it to be.

21
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,230
I'll stay on the movie,'cause it matters to me.

22
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,710
Any history of diabetes in the family? Cancer?

23
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,940
My birth mother died of cancer. 
Why?

24
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,760
I just want to run some tests.

28
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,660
Hi. I have to tell you something.

29
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,550
Peyton, are you okay?

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,530
I know it's late.

31
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,960
It's okay if it's late. What's up?

32
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,690
I'm not sure that I can call you my fiance anymore.

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,790
'Cause I was thinking maybe 
I'd start calling you my baby daddY.

34
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,280
Are we --

35
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,540
I'm having your baby, lucas scotT.

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,490
Our baby.

37
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,560
We're pregnant.

38
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,420
And, oh, god, I know it's sudden.

39
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,360
I just really want you to be okay with it,

40
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,690
because I'm very, very okay with iT.

41
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,720
And -- oh, and it's early. 
I mean, it's too early.

42
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,400
It's too early to even tell anybody.

43
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,510
I love you.

44
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,320
I love you, peyton.

45
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,090
I love you, too.

46
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,520
I hate it when deb calls to tell us 
that she's sleeping over at skills'

47
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,160
because her sleeping is not sleeping,

48
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,910
and it's the last thing want to hear about 
before I go to sleep.

49
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,530
That was the charleston chiefs.

50
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,700
You're looking at their newest point guard.

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,360
Oh, my god!

52
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,370
Oh, my god! And you say I'm badass.

53
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,600
Millie left me because of gigi.

54
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,570
I'm sorry, man.

55
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,120
Just say you told me sO.

56
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,060
You know you're my boy, right?

57
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,460
But I told you gigi was trouble, man --

58
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,420
always wanting you to work late.

59
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,130
And what comes after working late?

60
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,750
Freaky deaky.

61
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,290
We didn't freaky or deaky,but she wanted to.

62
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,220
And then millie found a picture of gigi on my cellphone.

63
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,950
You didn't erase it?

64
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,290
No.

65
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,190
It's erased now.

66
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,730
I don't know.Maybe millie was right.

67
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,400
Maybe I enjoyed all the attention from gigi,

68
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,680
so maybe I deserve to lose heR.

69
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,790
She'll come back.

70
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,330
You didn't see her.

71
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,120
I'm not sure she can come back from a broken heart.

72
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,040
Excuse me.

73
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,700
Excuse me.

74
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,930
I need some help.My daughter -- 

75
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,930
well, she's not my daughter.

76
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,850
She's my foster daughter -- sort of.

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,090
She's -- she's gone missing or run away or something.

78
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,380
Okay, ma'am, slow down.

79
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,320
Okay. Not a ma'am.And I'm -- I'm sorry.

80
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,290
It's just I've been up all night looking for saM.

81
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,710
Her name is sam,and she's usually back by now.

82
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,790
Okay, so, sam, and she's done this before?

83
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,090
Yes, but just to annoy me.It's --

84
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,900
and she comes back?

85
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,070
Yes, but this is different because --

86
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,860
okay, ma'am, so far, all you have is a kid

87
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,580
who's not really yours and who always comes bacK.

88
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,740
There's nothing much we can do about that.

89
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,960
- So, that's it? 
- I'm sorrY.

90
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,060
Look, come down to the station tomorrow 
if she hasn't returned, okay?

91
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,740
To protect and serve, my ass.

92
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,640
Rise and shine,porcupine.

93
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,930
Can a guy get five more minutes?

94
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,840
Okay, but today's a big day at the scott house.

95
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,120
How big are we talking?

96
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,770
Bigger than if christmas, 
your birthday, and pizza friday

97
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,410
all happened on "bring chester to school" day.

98
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,150
You made the b-league team?

99
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,300
That's right, I made it. 

100
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,530
I'm a charleston chief.
I start practice today.

101
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,090
You did it!

102
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,310
We did it.

103
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,200
Yay!

104
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,130
Morning, sam.

105
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,760
HeY.Um...

106
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,960
thanks for letting me crash.

107
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,780
Jack's friends are my friends.

108
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,270
And friends...do things for friends.

109
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,400
So, where's jack?

110
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,420
Out.

111
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,680
You know, sam,
I really wish you hadn't gone through my stufF.

112
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,150
The sketches?

113
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,450
I know you took them.

114
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,720
And now you've really pissed me off.

115
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,800
What now, julian?

116
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,030
Well, the director's threatening to walk,

117
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,170
and you've been summoned to oz.

118
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,530
The head of the studio wants to talk with you in an houR.

119
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,260
What the hell happened? 

120
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,320
***Screw you.

121
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,620
I have a flight in two hours,
and I'm not gonna do your damned joB.

122
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,530
You're the producer. 
Why don't you meet with the studio?

123
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,320
Well, he wants to meet with you.

124
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,750
And because you wrote a script for his studio, 
you're his bitch.

125
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,980
And as always, you're a dick.

126
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,380
Look, lucas,I worked really hard to get this movie green-lit,

127
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,070
and you screwed it up.So, get over there, 

128
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,110
avoid the 405, and save this movie.

129
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,960
So, tell me what you told brooke davis about those sketches.

130
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,710
I didn't tell her anything, 
'cause I don't know anything.

131
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,530
Look, I gave brooke the sketches.That's all.

132
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,330
I didn't rat you out. 
I didn't even know you took them.

133
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,220
It was all my fault anyway.
I was the one shooting off my mouth.

134
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,590
Oh, so, you're feeling guilty now.

135
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,400
Brooke was good to mE.

136
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,160
RighT.

137
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,700
Because she took you in?

138
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,330
Put you up in that big house?

139
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,240
Saved you from what?

140
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,510
From being like us?

141
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,090
I used to like you, saM.

142
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,840
I thought jack had caught himself a nice piecE.

143
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,250
But I don't like people who forget where they belong.

144
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,860
Dude, lay ofF.

145
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,500
Somebody grew a pair of balls last night.

146
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,660
Brooke tried to run away, too.

147
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,700
I think you two need to take some time

148
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,280
to think about what a couple of idiots you are.

149
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,570
I thought you were sober.

150
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,650
Not anymorE.

151
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,880
What are you doing here so early?

152
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,510
Apologizing for yesterday.

153
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,740
I was having a rage-against-the-man,

154
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,550
tortured-artist moment.

155
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,120
Oh, god.

156
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,150
Kill me.I'm the man now?

157
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,670
No.

158
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,020
You're the one who took a chance on me 
and guided my career,

159
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,830
and if you think I should record 
the songs from the label,I will.

160
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,740
Mia, I never want you to think 
I don't believe in your music.

161
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,480
I mean,you're my first artist.

162
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,530
It's like being my first kid.

163
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,110
And so, no matter what,I love you.

164
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,890
And I'm gonna support yoU.

165
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,260
But you got to tell me what's really going on.

166
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,200
It's not like I'm not writing.

167
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,580
It's like I can'T.The first record --

168
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,670
well, honey, your first record 
--that was a lifetime of worK.

169
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,300
But you can do this.

170
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,510
You have so many songs in you.I could see that year ago.

171
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,510
And I still see it now.

172
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,500
So, here's the plan --

173
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,320
I'm going to buy some time with our label partners,

174
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,430
and you are going to go write some kick-ass songs, okay?

175
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,700
That is, if you ever want to get on that ranky tour bus again.

176
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,670
I will. I promisE.

177
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,710
Your mama totally rocked that.

178
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,190
Peyton.

179
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,270
Hey, brooke, what are you --

180
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,930
sam's gone.

181
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,190
Save it for practice, scotT.

182
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,580
Bobby.

183
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,280
What are you doing here?I thought dave shea was the G.M.

184
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,680
He is. I'm your new coach.

185
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,020
What?

186
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,300
Yeah, the truth is,
my heart was never really into being a G.M.

187
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:15,310
I guess I just needed someone to remind me 
never to give up on a dream, you know?

188
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,510
Yeah, I had a friend who did the same for me.

189
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,430
So, is this, uh --is this your comeback?

190
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,680
Well, not yet.

191
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,640
I don't even know that I'm a good enough 
coach to turn you into a point guard.

192
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,320
But we'll give it a shot.

193
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,780
Welcome back.

194
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,540
You, too.

195
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,500
Oh, man, this is awesome.

196
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,150
My dad's a charleston chief.

197
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,560
He's at camp now, he's gonna play point guard.

198
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,980
Sorry. I bet basketball makes you think about "q" huh?

199
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,320
Yeah.I miss him.

200
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,210
I wish I could go to his grave and talk to hiM.

201
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,250
But mom won't go.

202
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,430
It makes her too sad.

203
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,810
Sometimes I go with my mama.

204
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,630
Maybe you can go with us next time.

205
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,880
I wish I could go today.

206
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,290
Maybe I can show you the way.

207
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,090
okay

208
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,410
Millie, can we talk?

209
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,820
Actually, I'm kind of busy right now pencil sharpening.

210
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,780
Brooke's sort of a slave driver 
when it comes to pencil points.

211
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,490
Talk to mouth.

212
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,190
Look, everything can be taken back.

213
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,480
- can it? - Yes.

214
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,040
And by the way you're both hurting,
it's obvious that you still love each otheR.

215
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:44,200
Besides...it's not fair to take it out 
on some poor,defenseless pencil.

216
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,670
Just talk to mouth.

217
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,770
Lucas scott.

218
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,550
Paul norriS.

219
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,580
Great script.

220
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,510
Thank you.

221
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,870
To make it to the screen, 
we'll need the right team behind iT.

222
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,980
That's why I asked you here.

223
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,110
I know.And about the director --

224
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,880
I want to talk about the producer.

225
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
Julian?

226
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,400
Julian.

227
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,770
What do you think of him?

228
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,430
Look, mr. Norris, I -- 

229
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,690
paul.

230
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,380
Paul, I'in tnew his business and can't really judge juliaN.

231
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,220
From what I hear,
I think you're actually the best one to judge julian.

232
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,440
Look, what happened yesterday makes me think

233
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,380
that julian doesn't know what he's doinG.

234
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,760
Now I got an a-list director 
who's threatening to walK.

235
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,820
- I'm sorry about that. 
- It's not your faulT.

236
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,980
Julian's the producer. He should have been therE.

237
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,630
I'm a straight shooter.

238
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,190
I know julian well.

239
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,340
He's an unpredictable loose cannon

240
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,530
whose arrogance gets in the way of doi his job.

241
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,180
We're talking straight here,right?

242
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,930
So, why do you keep working with him?

243
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,710
'Cause he's my son.

244
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,710
If you're looking for numb 23,it's already taken --

245
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,520
by me...

246
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,240
devon foX.

247
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,420
- I'm nathan -- 
- I know. Scott.

248
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,030
All-american at maryland.

249
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,470
Got thrown through a window,

250
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,560
cost you about $20 million guaranteed cash.

251
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,020
Thew away your shot at the nba.

252
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,630
Not very bright, are you?

253
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,290
Thought you were a two guarD.

254
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,920
I used to be. Switching to the point.

255
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,500
Bad move.

256
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,180
See, I'm the point guard,and this is my team.

257
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,020
This is my shot at the nba,

258
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,880
and I can guarantee I ain't throwing it away like you did.

259
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,810
Sure hope your son grows up arter than you, 15.

260
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,300
I take it my son didn't tell you about our connection.

261
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,350
Well, uh...

262
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:18,050
julian's not exactly up front when it comes to me.

263
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,370
He decided to use his mother's last name a few years ago.

264
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:25,680
Said he wanted to blaze his own trail,be his own man.

265
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,630
So, he moved into a little studio apartmentin north hollywood,

266
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,710
got a P.A. Job,fell in love.

267
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,470
How is peyton?

268
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,970
We're good.

269
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,620
Good for you.

270
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,030
Scotch?

271
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,490
Ah, no, thanks.

272
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,000
Peyton's a good girl.

273
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,620
She got julian to focus on something long enough to 

274
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,860
get his film to sundance.

275
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:52,520
Yeah, I-I heard it did well,had a lot of --had good buzz.

276
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,690
Buzz fades.

277
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,940
You're a tough audiencE.

278
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,420
That's why I'm successful.

279
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,620
And my son is a lot of talk.

280
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,960
He says he wants to make it on his own,

281
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,770
but he still came to me 
when he needed money to make this movie.

282
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,170
Well, I got to say I'm glad you gave it to hiM.

283
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,110
Julian never had a problem  finding a good thing.

284
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,220
It's his follow-through that's lacking.

285
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,790
Besides,this movie's a good investment.

286
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,690
It'll make money,especially in middle america.

287
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,880
But I still keep asking myself the same question.

288
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,200
What's that?

289
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,490
Same one you should be asking.

290
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,750
Is julian interested in making a good movie

291
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,750
or finding a way to get peyton back?

292
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,590
Ever see a '7dove shattered into like a gatrilceon pies?

293
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,870
Wow, peyton said it wasn't pretty in here.

294
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,850
Peyton's a big fan of the understatement.

295
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,830
Peyton is also a big fan of yours, and so am I.

296
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,230
So, I am here to help you.

297
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,290
Blast from the past! Where did you find this?

298
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,540
Clearly, not in your washing machine.

299
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,640
I practically lived in this thing 
when we recorded the first time.

300
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,650
I know.And then the tour came around,

301
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,380
and you left it behind,
so I thought I'd take care of it for you.

302
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,840
Thanks.

303
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,970
What do you say we try and find the girl

304
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,960
who used to wear that hoodie?

305
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,880
You're making quentin's favorite cookies again?

306
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,370
Yeah, sweetie, I-I guess I am.

307
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:53,630
Um, why don't you go on outside 
and have fun with jamie, okay?

308
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,960
And just make sure you stay in the yard, all right?

309
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,570
What'd she say?

310
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,710
She said we can go.

311
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,370
And she even gave us cookies.

312
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,680
Come on!

313
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,360
Sam's still not answering.

314
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,610
Will you try her again, please?

315
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,400
Okay, sweetie, but your driving --

316
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,890
can you just slow it down a little, 

317
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,780
'cause you're upset and I'm -- I'm carsick.

318
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,220
I'm sorry. I just...

319
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,990
I told sam that she could always talk to me about anything.

320
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,320
And the first anything that 
she talks to me about,and I just stood there.

321
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,720
Well, you were in shocK.

322
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,660
I mean, did she say anything about where she got the sketches?

323
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,740
No.I didn't even ask.

324
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:20,130
I'm supposed to be her foster-mother-guardian person,

325
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,330
and I just -- I let her go.

326
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,030
I didn't tell her it was gonna be okay.

327
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,910
I didn't tell her that I love her no matter what.

328
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,580
She knows.We're gonna find her

329
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,500
so you can tell her a thousand times.

330
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,850
I hope so.

331
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,650
Why isn't she answering her cell?

332
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,320
Damn it.

333
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,090
Your freak of a brother took my phone.

334
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,420
Okay, we got to get out of here 
and call the police or something.

335
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,350
 We don't go to the police.

336
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,490
He's my brother. 

337
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,890
Screw that, jack.

338
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,740
Your brother is a sketchy, thieving perv,

339
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,570
and you don't have to live like this.

340
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,040
He doesn't have to beat you,

341
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,570
and you don't have to be scared to come home 
at night or piss him off.You don'T.

342
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,080
It's open. Let's go.

343
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,240
No!Get the hell off of me!Jack! Jack!

344
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,200
Jack's not gonna get you help.

345
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,240
Please.

346
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:38,300
brooke, sweetie,you are gonna walk a hole in the floor.

347
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,840
I don't care. We need new floors anywaY.

348
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,190
Sam!

349
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,260
Julian, right now is not the time for 
whatever it is you're shoveling.

350
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,560
Not fair. You know I like feisty.

351
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,760
You want feisty? 

352
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,630
Peyton, it's okay.

353
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,270
I know you were looking for sam last night.

354
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,930
The waitress at the diner ratted you out.

355
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,280
Sam's a good kid.

356
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,450
She is.Thank yoU.

357
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,310
So, how'd that all turn out?

358
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,280
She's still gone, and I have no idea where to start

359
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,860
because I know nothing about her real life.

360
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,200
I was so busy laying down the law --

361
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,400
no stealing from my wallet,

362
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,290
no breaking into my store,

363
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,290
no boys in your room.

364
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,600
You're a good mom.

365
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,330
No boys in her room except for the one in her beD.

366
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,820
You're a cool mom.

367
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,660
Oh, my god, I'm a stupid mom. 
Jack daniels.

368
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,400
Not the drink.The boy that was in sam's bed.

369
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,430
I can't believe I didn't think about this earlier.

370
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,690
I have --I have to find him.

371
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,740
Okay, we'll just ask haley.

372
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,450
Wait, sort of floppy hair?

373
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,400
YeS.

374
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,040
Yeah, she was with him at the diner.
I'll keep an eye out.

375
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,340
Maybe he's not so baD.

376
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,110
You know what?

377
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:45,120
You just got a glimpse of the guy I used to know.

378
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,300
The whole julian-peyton thing has got to be on your mind.

379
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,540
No, I'm not worried about it.

380
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,600
You should be.

381
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,420
You don't like your son too much, do you?

382
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,760
Sometimes...

383
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,510
You have a vision of who you want your child to be,

384
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,750
and no matter what you do,they fall shorT.

385
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,530
So, about the director --

386
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,120
I heard things went a bit off course.

387
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,920
You should know, 
julian has some very definite opinions about the director,

388
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,070
and like everything else,

389
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,090
he and I want different things.

390
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,340
What do you want?

391
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,330
I want a director that understands the characters,

392
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,470
you know? I mean, someone who sees 
and appreciates the small moments,

393
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,450
because that's what this movie's really about.

394
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,660
And this guy's not that director.

395
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,890
No. I'm sorry, sir,

396
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,910
but he's not that director.

397
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,400
Funny. That's what my son said.

398
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,270
That's what my mama said,
but I still believe in ghosts.

399
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,100
Me, too.Especially at night.

400
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,360
You scared of them?

401
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,800
NaH.

402
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,760
'Cause I think quentin is a good ghost.

403
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,410
Betcha he plays ghost basketball.

404
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,830
For sure.

405
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,690
I think some ghosts are like angelS.

406
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,680
Yeah.

407
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:15,240
I wonder why ghosts don't need wings to fly and angels do.

408
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,020
We should google that.

409
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,100
Yeah.

410
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,080
Are you sure we're going the right way?

411
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,150
Yeah, 'cause we're following that ghost.

412
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,870
Gotcha, scaredy.

413
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,370
Hey, gentlemen, get set up!

414
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,180
Come on, 15.

415
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,730
What, you scared?

416
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,730
Thinking about how you're not going to the nba?

417
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,220
Again?

418
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,360
Is that all you got?

419
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,430
Let's go! Come on! Go,go,go.

420
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,720
Come on, guys.Fight through.

421
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,070
Fight through.

422
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,410
Let's go!

423
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,430
Back on "D."

424
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,090
Ball! Ball! Ball!

425
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,360
Come on!I got ball! I got ball!

426
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,930
Yeah.

427
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,250
Gotcha, babe!

428
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,260
Oh, yes!

429
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:20,280
Scott, take a seat.

430
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,400
Shupert, you're in.

431
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,030
Get comfortable, 15

432
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,950
 get real comfortable.

433
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,220
Let's go! Come on!

434
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,870
It sucks, right?

435
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,150
No, it doesn't sucK.

436
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,480
You might want to tell your face that.

437
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,770
Okay, let's start from the beginning.
What's the song about?

438
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,660
Well, it's about me...

439
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,780
writing a song so I don't have to record the label's crap.

440
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,920
Okay, so, how did you write your first album?

441
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,290
Because I'm pretty sure it wasn't about you writing a hit.

442
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,410
No. It was about making myself feel better

443
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,980
and embarrassing my tool of a boyfriend.

444
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,670
Okay, so, that's what you need.

445
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,240
A horrible assface of a boyfriend?

446
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,960
No, you need the inspiration and 
the fight that you got from that --

447
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,470
you know, the challenge from living your own life

448
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,230
instead of sitting on a tour bus or in a music studio,

449
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,280
willing yourself to write a hit song.

450
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,590
You got to get up and get out there.

451
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,280
What?

452
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,140
Go outside.Go take a walk.Talk to a stranger.

453
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,420
Find whatever it was that made you stop 

454
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,410
what you were doing and write a verse down on a napkin.

455
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,630
And then come back here and see what happens.

456
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,340
- Seriously? - Trust me, it works.Bye!

457
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,990
Where are you going?

458
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,940
I guess to get a life.

459
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:56,570
Oh. What's wrong?

460
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,730
It's sam.

461
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,660
I am so sorry.

462
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,610
Me too.

463
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,000
You have nothing to feel sorry abouT.

464
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,790
I should have been more considerate 
about your feelings about gigi.

465
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,900
And if you'll give me another chance,

466
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,270
I'll do whatever it takes to have you back in my life,

467
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,050
because you're the best part of me, millicent.

468
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,580
You're the best part of us.

469
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,040
I had sex last night.

470
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:39,450
Say somethinG.Please.

471
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,500
I'm sorry. 

472
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,610
I was drunk, and it was a mistake.

473
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:51,230
And I wish I could take it back, because 

474
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,840
it was supposed to be you --us, but...

475
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,370
This is the last address I have for jacK.

476
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,480
Okay, thank you.Thank you. 
Thank you.I hope she's there.

477
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,700
She's a teenage girl.Trust me, she's there.

478
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,660
Okay, brooke, we should get going.

479
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,040
I think that I need to go by myself.

480
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,870
I don't want to show up there like some parent patrol,

481
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,790
and sam and i need to talk alone.

482
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,750
Are you sure?

483
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,280
Yeah, I'm sure. I-I'll call you, though. 

484
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,000
- I'll call both of you. Thank you. 
- Okay.

485
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,480
- Bye. 
- Bye.

486
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,530
God, I hope she is there.

487
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,680
Yeah, me, too.

488
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,030
It was terrifying not knowing where jamie was.

489
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,820
Sometimes, I just want to lock him up and homeschool him.

490
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,410
That's my plan.

491
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,100
I mean, in, like, the future when I need a plan.

492
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,510
Oh, my god!You're pregnant!

493
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,880
I don't what you're talking about!

494
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,540
You are pregnant!I have dibs on godmother!

495
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,550
Make one sound and you'll be an orphaN.Again.

496
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:23,370
So, like I said, I'm looking for my foster daughter, sam,

497
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,870
and I think that she's friends with your brother.

498
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,660
Sorry i don't much pay attention to jack's friends.

499
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,640
Well, is he here? Maybe I could talk to him.

500
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:34,890
Nope.

501
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,810
We're alone.

502
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,430
Do you know where he is or where he hangs out?
Maybe they're together.

503
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,070
Do you think they're having sex?

504
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,840
Mmm, no.

505
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,940
What's wrong with sex?

506
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:57,450
Look, I don't know where the kid is.
He comes and goes, okay?

507
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,160
I'm just trying to pay the bills around here.

508
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,800
So, the truth is, it's better when he's gone.

509
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,120
One less mouth eating up my fooD.

510
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,230
Speaking of mouths, yours is nicE.

511
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,520
That's good work on the court today.

512
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,100
Not good enough.

513
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,060
Well, hang in here.You're just coming back.

514
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,090
The game's gonna have you on the ropes for a bit.

515
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,850
Yeah,that and my teammates.

516
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:29,710
Look, nate, you scare a lot of these guys.

517
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:35,100
This league is their nba, and they know it's not yours.

518
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,230
Oh, hey, coach,

519
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,810
you mind if I wear the number 12?

520
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,190
it*** someone special

521
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,520
I'm taking your spot,because I'm better than yoU.

522
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,820
But here's the good news --

523
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,880
when I get called up to the nba,

524
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,020
you can have your job back.

525
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,060
I'll see you tomorrow.

526
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,030
My mama cries a lot.

527
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,710
She doesn't think I know,

528
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,160
but I can hear her sometimes in her rooM.

529
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,300
My dad used to cry, too,when he was hurt.

530
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:58,510
What did you do?

531
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,110
I tried to be his friend.

532
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,070
My mama told me that sometimes

533
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,420
people have to cry out all the tears 
to make room for a heart full of smiles.

534
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,230
Hope my mama is almost ready for a smile.

535
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,790
Andre?Jamie?

536
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:20,260
Boys?Honey?

537
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,330
You're an idiot, you know that?

538
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,740
I appreciate the time today,lucas.

539
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,250
You're very impressive.

540
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,230
Thank you.

541
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:08,050
Which is why I think we need the right producer.

542
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,640
I'll be in touch.

543
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,940
You firing julian?

544
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,130
You can't have a problem with that.

545
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,920
Look, you like the script, right?

546
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,750
'Cause julian was a big part of making it great.

547
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,730
I doubt it.

548
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,580
I know my son.I know what he can and can't do.

549
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,640
With all due respect, sir,

550
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,070
I just found out I'm gonna be a fatheR.

551
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,580
And if one day my son comes to me 
and asks me to believe in him

552
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:38,720
or take a risk or bet on him, 

553
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:42,450
I can't believe that I wouldn't do thaT.

554
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,710
So, you believe in julian?

555
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:51,140
I believe he wants to make a great movie, yeah.

556
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,750
Okay, he stays.

557
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,760
What are you doing here, man?

558
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,250
Peyton called me .

559
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,630
What the hell happened?

560
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,020
I got injured...

561
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,180
During the slamball finals.

562
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,790
They started me on this pain medication.

563
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,110
I don't know. I thought I was doing okay at firsT.

564
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,710
But I guess it's true --

565
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,640
once an addict,always an addict.

566
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,990
Things with brooke...

567
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,000
you know,you need help with this.

568
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,760
I mean, u're an alcoholic who's working at a bar.

569
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,690
I know, but it's not like I can just walk ouT.

570
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,800
Then I'll take over for yoU.

571
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,750
I'm the worst carpet salesman out there anyways.

572
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:53,960
You'd do that for me?

573
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,090
No.

574
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,390
I'd do that for the other version of you.

575
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,500
Okay.

576
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,100
Thanks.

577
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,260
Hey.

578
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,520
Hey, is sam with you?

579
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,160
Kind of.

580
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,970
I need your help.

581
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,370
So, if you see sam, just please 
tell her to call or come home.

582
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,310
It probably makes you feel good, 
taking in some poor kid, huh?

583
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,430
Like you're doing something special,

584
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,370
slumming with us poor folk.

585
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:36,240
You don't know anything about me.

586
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,720
Have a nice night.

587
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,860
Have a nice nighT.

588
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,590
Where is she?

00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,560
I know she's in here!

590
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,290

591
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,880

594
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,070
Sam!

595
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,030
Sam!

596
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,270

597
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,320
Oh, my god!

598
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,430
Okay, okay, okay.Okay, it's okay.

00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,320
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.It's okaY.

600
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,640
He's the one who attacked you.
You have to get out.

601
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,790
I know. I'm not leaving you here.

602
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,100
You have to get out of here.

603
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,110
I am not leaving you here!

604
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,710
Brooke!No!

605
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,400
sam. 

606
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:58,670
Leave her alone!

607
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,840
You need to teach that little slut some manners!

608
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,040
Get off of her!

609
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,670

Should have finished the job when I had the chance!

613
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,420
Brooke!

614
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,870
I love watching you crawl, miss davis.

615
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:33,090
Oh, what's wrong? Does the weak, little rich girl want to leave?

616
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,950
The weak, little rich girl thinks she'll stay a while.

617
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,620
You filthy, thieving, heartless piece of trash.

618
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,180
You ain't gonna shoot me.

619
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,230
Like I said, you don't know me.

620
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:53,440
I'm not the same girl from the store that nighT.She's gone!

621
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:58,420
You took my life, and you turned it into a nightmare.

622
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:03,800
And all I have thought about is that I hate you.

623
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,000
Brooke?

624
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,260
I hate you.

625
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:18,250
Brooke, please, don'T.

626
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,090
Please.

627
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,410
I need you, mom.

628
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,760
I hate you so much.

629
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:40,210
But you're not worth any more of my time.

630
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,360
And you're not worth my life. 

631
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,690
You have a nice night.

632
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,490
It's okay.

633
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,500
I'm so sorry. 

634
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,430
It's okay.It's okay.

635
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,110
You're safe.You're okay.

636
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,240
It's okay.

637
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,490
Hi, big brother.

638
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,070
Brought you your favorite cookies.

639
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,580
I was wondering if you could help me.

640
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:46,820
Andre fields!Oh!

641
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:52,000
I told you not to leave the yard!
Why did you leave the yard!

642
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,370
Don't you know you are all I have left?

643
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,140
Oh, god.

644
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,580
Come here.Come here.Come here.

645
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,260
Okay, come here.

646
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:04,540
I'm sorry, mama.I just want to talk to quentin.

647
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,820
What?

648
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,210
I just want to ask him to let you know

649
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,520
that he's all right so you're not sad anymorE.

650
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,650

656
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,530

So, you're, like, way better at this than i am.

Do you want a job tending bar?

660
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,160
I can'T. I'm only 18.

661

Have fun.

662
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,830
If it helps, I have no idea 
what I'm doing in there, either.

663
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,730
Come on,  let me get you guys home.

664
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,320
Hey, look what I found.

665
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,740

Oh, my god.

667
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,940

Hey, daddy. How is it? What's it like?

Slow down, buddy.

No, you first, daddy.

00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,540
Is it a dream come true?

677
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,750
Yes, it is, son.

678
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:59,150
