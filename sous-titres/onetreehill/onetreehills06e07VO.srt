00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,950
nate,mike wilson.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,970
Listen,I heard you were looking for  the opportunity to play ball again.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,650
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,450
You have to do this,daddy.

6
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,830
This can't be good for my back.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,130
Man,that can't be good for nobody's back.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,700
You're coming home.

9
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,680
I guessI never really left.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,550
Can you help me make a cape?

11
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,090
Quentin really likes mine,

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,410
and I thought maybe we could make one for him,too.

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,690
Tell me where you live,

14
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,760
because I'm pretty sure it's not in shop class.

15
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,440
I live in a foster home.

16
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,910
Would you be interested in fostering a child?

17
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,890
Well,I guess it would depend on the situation.

18
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,640
I've never had my own room before.

Luke!

23
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,290
You should read this.It's really cool.

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,580
Huh?My book?

25
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,640
No. It's an article about moving in together.

26
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,400
It says we need to have our own space

27
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,430
in order to ease the transition.

28
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,330
Y ahead of you.

29
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,390
What is that?

30
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,600
Oh,it's your cage,silly.

31
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,570
I figured you need your own space.

32
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,620
And look,it's even got a little bed of hay.

33
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,230
I know how you like hay.

34
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,710
Luke,cut it out.

35
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,760
Come on.Get up

36
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,330
Man,brooke looks hot here.

37
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,910
Maybe you two could share the cage,huh?

38
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,470
What?

39
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,910
Funny,I don't remember ordering bad italian.

40
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,820
Sorry to bother you so late,

41
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,850
but,uh,caught you buying drinks at the bar tonight.

42
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,840
I know the license is yours,

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,900
but she claims to belong to you,too.

44
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,010
You have a 15-year-old daughter?

45
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,480
How long has it been?

46
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,120
Not long enough.

47
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,740
Thanks.

48
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,780
You're welcome.Sam?

49
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,450
Can you just yell at me in the morning?

50
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,530
I'm really tired.

51
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,090
Wh--

52
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,040
I'll bet you are.

53
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,270
Because being brooke davis is exhausting!

54
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,170
I miss angie.

55
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,820
marvin?

56
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,650
Millie,what are you doing in omaha?

57
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,500
What?!

58
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,310
Oh,my god!What are you doing here?

59
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,730
I had this horrible dream  where I lived far away from you,

60
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,420
and every time I spoke, I'd say this awful catchphrase.

61
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,780
Only it wasn't a dream.

62
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,330
So I quit my job.Again.

63
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,220
- For me? - For us.

64
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,180
Without you,omaha just felt cold and lonely.

65
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,040
Do you feel better now?

66
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,530
Now I'm just cold.

67
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,860
Get in here.

68
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,770
- Whoa,daddy can fly. - Yes,he can.

69
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,870
Oh,I can't tell you how happy it makes me  to see you playing again.

70
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,080
Thanks,baby.

71
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,130
You know,it'd really make me happy to see you play again.

72
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,910
You haven't been in the studio in a while.

73
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,860
Yeah,well,too much has happened lately  to think about music.

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,140
Well,the deal was we both go after our dreams,remember?

75
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,910
Yeah,mama.

76
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,750
I like when you sing.

77
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,120
Oh,you do,huh?

78
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,940
Well,I hope you don't think that I'm uncool

79
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,460
when I say that you're late for school

80
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,630
oh,never mind.

81
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,880
I'll see you.Okay,bye.

82
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:49,850
See you,buddy.

83
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,400
hey.How'd you sleep?

84
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,670
Not very well.

85
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,580
Someone hit me with a magazine.

86
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,890
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,870
I was reading an article in B. Davis magazine,

88
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,770
and I had a bad dream.

89
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,850
It's about moving in together.

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,950
What's so scary about that?

91
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,930
Well,"once you move in,expect to find out

92
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,190
you don't know each other as well as you think."

93
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,610
That's ridiculous.

94
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,270
Everybody says we're like twins.

95
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,430
Okay,you're right.

96
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,620
And to make up for the magazine attack,

97
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,530
I'm making your favorite breakfast.

98
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,570
Oh,really?French toast?

99
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,620
Pancakes.

100
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,500
Pancakes!

101
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,080
Sam,I made breakfast!

102
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,850
Sam!

103
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,850
Come on!

104
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,920
Unbelievable.

105
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,070
Cut it out!

106
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,060
"Cut it out!"

107
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,390
Let go!You'll rip it!

108
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,760
So? Then you'll have two stupid capes.

109
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,470
It's not stupid!I wear it for my friend quentin!

110
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,020
Then quentin must be stupid.

111
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,600
Fight,fight,fight,fight!

112
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,090
"move in,don't expect his stuff to move out."

113
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,740
Apparently guys don't like  changing anything when a woman moves in.

114
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,150
That's not true.

115
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,570
Oh,really? That's funny.

116
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,290
'Cause yesterday when I was cleaning,

117
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,370
I knocked over a picture of you and lindsey.

118
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:42,320
I,uh...I - I thought I got all those.

119
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,580
I-I'm sorry.

120
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,070
Nah,I know I'm being silly.

121
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,570
I just feel like a guest in your house.

122
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,520
And I haven't unpacked any of my boxes

123
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,580
'cause I don't know where to put anything.

124
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,810
Well,does the all-knowing magazine have a fix,

125
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,540
or does it just point out problems?

126
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,010
Let's see.It says we should work it out

127
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,700
by communicating openly,

128
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,250
compromising,and focusing on each other.

129
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,500
Doesn't just say that we should have sex?

130
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,720
Fine.

131
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,650
How about this? Okay...

132
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,710
neither one of us leaves

133
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,030
until you're completely moved in.

134
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,460
Okay?

135
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,360
I mean,unless,that is,that my sugar mama needs to work.

136
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,760
Oh,no,your sugar mama's her own boss.

137
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,450
And she just gave me some time off.

138
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,460
Okay.

139
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,710
Then it's official.

140
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,690
We are...

141
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,130
...on house arrest.

142
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,500
Haiku is a japanese poem

143
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,230
which consists of three lines of five,seven,

144
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,050
and five syllables,respectively.

145
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,580
A good example of this would be --

146
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,960
My friend,brooke davis

147
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,040
blowing through my class like wind

148
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,050
sam in trouble,no?

149
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,180
I hate school.

150
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,160
School was never my strong suit,either.

151
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,810
It's a good thing we're both handsome.

152
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,200
What's wrong?

153
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,900
I got in a fight with chuck scholnik

154
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,820
'cause he teased me about my cape.

155
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,240
I know the scholnik family.

156
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,570
You should tease him about his alcoholic mother.

157
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,580
I just want him to leave me alone.

158
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,900
Yeah,I know the feeling.

159
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,560
I was teased when I was in prison.

160
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,310
About what?

161
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,540
The point is that as a scott man,

162
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,710
people are always gonna be jealous of you.

163
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,790
It's a burden we have to live with.

164
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,480
Scott men are inherently better than most people.

165
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,070
Daddy,too?

166
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,650
Especially your daddy.

167
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,430
I thought we were past dressing up  to impress each other.

168
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,680
Does this mean I need to toss the footie pajamas?

169
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,320
Well,if the alternative is you sleeping naked,yes.

170
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,360
I'm going to the station to beg for my old job.

171
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,060
I hope they take me back.

172
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,440
They'd be stupid not to.

173
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,000
You're a big tv star now.

174
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,090
With your own catchphrase and everything.

175
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,030
I'm sorry I ever spent a minute away from you.

176
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,030
You just said a mouthful.

177
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,650
Very funny.

178
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,720
I'm sorryI disrupted your class.

179
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,630
It's okay.I turned you into a haiku.

180
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,350
Gesundheit.

181
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,690
I take itthings aren't going very well between you and sam.

182
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,800
She stole my I.D. Last night and snuck out.

183
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,040
When you asked me to take her, I thought I'd be getting little orphan annie.

184
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,640
Instead of singing and dancing,

185
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,740
I have stealing and disappearing.

186
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,140
Do you want me to talk to her?

187
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,730
No.No,I'll handle it.

188
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,400
Okay.

189
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,330
How do I handle it?

190
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,780
You got to talk to her tonight  and lay down some ground rules.

191
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,480
She needs structure.

192
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,800
She's actually a really bright kid.

193
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,190
Fine.

194
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,100
For you,I will try.

195
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,290
I just --  I need her to try,too,you know?

196
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,700
Even if it's just a little.

197
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,080
I think that's totally fair.

198
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,740
Good.

199
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,210
I'll let you know how it goS.

200
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,110
Thank you,brooke.

201
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,700
Yeah,thank me if I don't kill her by tomorrow.

202
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,470
So where do you want to start?

203
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,380
Well,that's easy.

204
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,970
I never feel at home until I unpack my music.

205
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,310
But you know what? Maybe we don't have to.

206
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,960
I mean,we probably have doubles of everything,right?

207
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,970
Actually,I don't like the cure.

208
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,570
How can you not likethe cure?

209
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,080
Well,their music's depressing and whiny.

210
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,720
Yeah,and if it could squint,it would be you.

211
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,760
You do realize that the lyrics  I spent all day painting

212
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,690
at the river court were cure lyrics,right?

213
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,770
Oh,yeah,I know.And I love the lyrics.

214
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,720
I hate the music.

215
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,580
I don't even know who you are right now.

216
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,190
Come on,peyton.  Look,I'm just trying to be honest.

217
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,590
I mean,there's got to be things that  I like that you don't,right?

218
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,190
Yeah.Yeah,okay.

219
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,250
Now that you mention it.

220
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,820
Your tattoo.

221
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,310
What about it?

222
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,480
Well,first off,it does not mean  what you think it does,

223
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,660
'cause I looked it up.

224
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,410
Second,brooke hasa very similar tattoo.

225
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,260
Near her lady business.

226
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,820
Now,if you will excuse me,

227
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,500
I'm gonna go take my cure albums  where they'll be appreciated.

228
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,640
Like the trash?

229
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,510
You see? We are totally different

230
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,450
just like the article says.

231
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,930
Thanks a lot,brooke.

232
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,550
okay..."friday I'm in love" isn't too bad

233
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,390
it's nice in here.

234
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,140
How come we haven't moved into the master bedroom?

235
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,670
You mean my mom's room?

236
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,420
No,I mean the master bedroom.

237
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,450
I mean,she gave you the house,right

238
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,950
Yeah.

239
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,510
It'd just be...

240
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,040
too weird sleeping in here as an adult.

241
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,660
Who said anything about sleeping?

242
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,700
Oh,ho ho ho!No.  Definitely out of the question.

243
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,260
Luke,we are adults.

244
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,230
Shouldn't we be in the adult room?

245
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,990
Who's asking?

246
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,440
You,or B. Davis magazine?

247
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,770
Whichever will get you to do it.

248
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:02,520
I would tell the magazine that my room's bigger.

249
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,780
And I like it better.

250
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,070
And I would tell peyton that...

251
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,990
...That I would do anything for her,

252
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:16,970
even something as creepy as sleeping in my mom's room.

253
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,220
Then I guess I'm asking.

254
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,110
Then I guess I'm moving.

255
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,640
- I love your music.  - Thank you.

256
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,280
Your album is one of my favorites.

257
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,180
Thanks.

258
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,430
I even have a slot reserved in  my cd case for your next record.

259
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,430
There is gonna be a next record,right?

260
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,530
I hope so.

261
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,870
I hope so,too.

262
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,470
Your voice is incredible.

263
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,720
You're not so bad yourself.

264
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,240
You don't have a cd I can buy,do you?

265
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,640
No,no.I-I just do this for fun.

266
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,090
But it must be amazing to sing for a living.

267
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,860
It used to be.

268
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,380
So much has been going on lately, music doesn't seem to matter much.

269
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,360
That's too bad, because it matters to a lot of other people.

270
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,470
Well,it looks like your music matters a lot,too.

271
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,210
You don't want to keep your fans waiting.

272
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,960
Neither do you.

273
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,070
hi,chris.

274
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,850
I wanted to talk to you about how we left things.

275
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,530
Just hear me out.

276
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,780
I know that omaha's a bigger market.

277
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,910
But this is your home.

278
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,220
- I agree,which is why - - what'll it take?

279
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,750
We need you.

280
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,970
Well,uh,I could use an office,

281
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,140
better snacks in the lunch room.

282
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,800
And,uh,I had an internin omaha.

283
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,800
Done,done,and done.

284
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,770
Thing is,we need you to start A.S.A.P.,

285
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,480
Like,uh...tomorrow?

286
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,080
What do you think?

287
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,520
I think omaha's gonna miss me.

288
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,010
Yeah.Terrific.

289
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,760
Hey,buddy.

290
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,580
Your mom and I would like to talk to you for a second.

291
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,050
Think you could pause that game?

292
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,220
Not if I'm in trouble.

293
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,850
You're not in trouble.

294
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,570
We just heard you got in a fight at school today.

295
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,950
A kid grabbed my cape.

296
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,420
He wouldn't let go of it.He said it was stupid.

297
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,740
Sounds like that kidis stupid.

298
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,540
I mean,a man should know never  to grab another man's cape.

299
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,540
Nathan.

300
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,050
Your cape,kiddo,is not stupid,okay?

301
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,000
Hey,when I was younger,I had a poncho

302
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,220
that everybody else said was really ugly,

303
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,570
but I really liked it,so I kept wearing it.

304
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,800
And that's what you should do.If you like your cape,

305
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,600
you should just wear it whenever you want

306
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,590
and ignore what everybody else says.

307
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,730
Well,what if he keeps picking on me?

308
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,810
Oh,well,I can teach you how to deal with bullies.

309
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,570
And what your father means by that

310
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:29,070
is if somebody's picking on you, you should just walk away.

311
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,450
Right,honey?

312
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,890
Yes.Yes,she's right.

313
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,240
But I want to be tough like daddy.

314
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,500
Well,hey.

315
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,170
If you can learn to walk away,

316
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,280
you'll be tougher than I ever was.

317
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,760
It's not funny.

318
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,260
I'm sorry.

319
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,800
I'm only laughing because of how angry you got.

320
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,010
I mean,I've never heardany body yell at it before.

321
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,150
Oh,honey,it is not a big deal.

322
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,740
Doesn't it happen to every guy at some point?

323
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,210
And it wouldn't have happened at all  if we weren't in my mom's bed!

324
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,580
This is your fault.

325
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,020
Well,you have never complained before.

326
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:19,690
I'm talking about your obsession with this stupid magazine.

327
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,610
Oh,my god,the magazine has been dead on.

328
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,420
It has predicted pretty much everything.

329
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,930
I just wish it would have warned me about this.

330
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,230
Okay,all right.

331
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,760
Okay.

332
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,060
What are you doing?

333
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,150
Well,it seems I've made a huge mistake.

334
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,990
I'm calling lindsey.

335
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,450
Fine.

336
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,010
If you think that'll help.

337
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,180
Hey.Have I been in tonight?

338
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,800
Was that a trick question?

339
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,890
Sam?Have you seen her?

340
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,570
Not since last night.

341
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,990
Why,did she run outon you again?

342
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:00,950
No.

343
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,210
She's actually waiting in the car.

344
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,980
I just needed an excuse to see you.

345
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,220
Sorry I asked.

346
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,120
You know,you're a jerk.

347
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,220
I told you I wanted to be a mom,

348
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,130
and you ran away so fast,

349
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,630
you left an owen-shaped hole in my front door,

350
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,520
and I never heard from you again.

351
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,250
Not so much as a phone call.

352
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:26,680
And if you hadn't caught little brooke vis junior  with my I.D.,I still wouldn't have.

353
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,790
You're right.

354
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,390
You didn't deserve that.

355
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,410
I'm sorry.

356
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,500
Whatever.

357
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,650
You're still a jerk.

358
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,850
what's going on?

359
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,210
"When moving in,

360
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,230
"be ready for him to unpack this little secret --

361
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,280
he wants his own space."

362
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,210
If it's in the magazine,it must be true.

363
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,540
So you stay on your side of the line,

364
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,000
and you get my mom's bed.

365
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,480
And I'll get the tv and the kitchen,huh?

366
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,280
What is this,"the brady bunch"?

367
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,600
Just so you know,if you cross this line,

368
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,020
you'll be admitting that this article is stupid.

369
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,910
And that I'm right.

370
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:16,980
About everything.

371
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,050
Fine. Looks like I get the bathroom.

372
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,990
Fine.

373
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,220
I'm hungry.

374
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,620
I think I'll go make myself some,uh...french toast.

375
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,880
Oh,it is so on.

376
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,550
Sweetie,is that the boy that was picking on you?

377
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,180
No. I thought my shoew as untied.

378
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,440
Bye,mama.

379
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,220
Bye,sweetie.

380
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,030
Excuse me,could I talk to you for a second?

381
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,850
I'm haley scott.I'm jamie's mom.

382
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:00,460
Jamie came home from school upset the other day.

383
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,370
I guess your son was teasing him.

384
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,520
Well,you know how boys are.

385
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,080
Don't you think we should do something about it?

386
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,990
No,I think it's best if we let  the boys work it out for themselves.

387
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,010
so much better than tattling,don't you think?

388
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,770
Uh,he's not tattling.

389
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,390
He's 5 years old,and he just wants to be left alone.

390
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,560
Jamie?

391
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,970
Is he the one with the cape?

392
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,050
5 is a little old for a cape,don't you think?

393
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,670
Maybe you should do him a favor, take it away from him,

394
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,940
and then he won't get teased anymore.

395
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,680
About the cape,anyway.

396
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,100
What is that supposed to mean?

397
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,250
He's probably just a late bloomer.

398
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,200
I'm sure he'll make friends...someday.

399
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,690
Listen,honey,

400
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,770
if your little brat doesn't stop picking on my son,

401
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,100
not only will I give jamie permission to kick his ass,

402
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,250
but I'll be kicking your ass right along side of him.

403
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,240
Got that,bitch?

404
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,910
I'd like to see you try,little girl.

405
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,430
What happened to walking away?

406
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,010
I know,but you didn't see her.

407
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,530
She was such a bitch.

408
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,140
Sounds like you made that pretty clear.

409
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,020
Jamie's been through so much lately,

410
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,870
the last thing he needs is some bully picking on him.

411
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,060
He'll be fine.

412
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,550
He's a tough kid.

413
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,160
But you know what?I'll take care of it.

414
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,430
In the meantime, just try not to kill anybody,okay,slugger?

415
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,030
What are you gonna do?

416
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,510
I'm gonna call his mom a bitch and then push her.

417
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,110
Oh,that's right.

418
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,470
You already did that,didn't you?

419
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,220
Look,I don't know what I'm gonna do,okay?

420
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,040
But I'll take care of it.I'll think of something.

421
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,500
I'm sorry.

422
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,110
Oh,are you kidding me?

423
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,120
My girl is a bad ass.

424
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,290
That's hot.

425
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,370
Damn,he's good.

426
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:13,260
Looky what I found on my side.

427
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,260
Oh,no,no,no,no,no.

428
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,350
You cross,you lose.

429
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,180
"Fergie,I love you very much

430
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,520
"and miss you every time we're apart.

431
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:30,810
I need to see you...soon."

432
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,510
Don't you dare.

433
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,210
Oops.

434
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,520
what's up?

435
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:50,590
Lucas loves him some fergalicious.

436
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,940
Hi,brooke.It's nice to see you,too.

437
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,930
I'm sorry. I was just hoping you might be sam.

438
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,410
But apparently all she know show to do is leave.

439
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,430
Is it that bad?

440
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,280
I think she likes me about as much as I like my mother.

441
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,170
Well,we both know there's some parents you're better off without

442
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,730
but you're not one of them.

443
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,010
She'll realize that.

444
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,810
Unfortunately,she hasn't stuck around long enough to figure that out.

445
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,790
Thank you for coming to check on me.

446
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,490
Well,actually,I need a favor.

447
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,660
It's last minute,

448
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,870
it's a lot of work,and I need it in two hours.

449
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,570
As tempting as that sounds,

450
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,240
I'm still orphan-deep in the last favor I did for the scott family.

451
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,380
It's for jamie.

452
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,660
What do you need?

453
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,000
It's my new hero!

454
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,960
Hey!

455
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,710
I've been here three years.

456
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,140
I've never gotten a raise.

457
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,880
You tell them to shove their job,

458
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,340
you get a better position,a new office

459
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,100
and a hot intern.

460
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,120
Well,I don't know if --

461
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,070
hot intern?

462
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,530
- Gigi? - Mouth!

463
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,970
Wait,you guys know each other?

464
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,990
We were high-school lovers.

465
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,620
Nice!

466
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,540
it's a bird!

467
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,550
It's a plane!

468
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,530
It's superbaby!

469
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:31,080
Aw,are you sad?

470
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,950
Are you gonna go fly home to your mommy?

471
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,260
No.I'm gonna walk away.

472
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,490
So who doesn't think that capes are cool?

473
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:49,590
well,if I didn't have a cape,I couldn't do this.

474
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,610
Oh,by the way,

475
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,930
that box right there is full of capes,

476
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,080
if anybody wants one.

477
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,790
You didn't come home last night.

478
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,030
It's not my home.

479
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,670
Besides,you said I could come and go as I please.

480
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,650
So I left.

481
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,790
That is not what I meant.

482
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,780
I was worried about you.

483
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,320
Sam...I can't help you

484
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,660
if you're not willing to be helped.

485
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,890
Apparently,you'd rather eat here than in my kitchen,

486
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,890
and you want to sleep in a car instead of my guest room.

487
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,670
I don't know what to do for you.

488
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,100
I just don't thinkth is is gonna work.

489
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,990
It's okay.

490
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,490
I'm used to people giving up on me.

491
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,040
Happens all the time.

492
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,030
See that waitress over there?

493
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,360
That's my mom.

494
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,370
One day,I'm gonna tell her who I am,

495
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,920
and what a big mistake she made.

496
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,820
Like I said,I'm used to people giving up on me.

497
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,390
Thanks anyway.

498
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,710
Sam...

499
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,170
my god.

500
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,480
So,my girlfriend and imoved to omaha,

501
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,390
but then my girlfriend moved back.

502
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,950
So I decided to move back to be with her.

503
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,250
You're so much more muscular than you were in high school.

504
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,630
Yeah,my girlfriend is really into being healthy,

505
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,480
so I am,too.

506
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,630
For my -- my girlfriend.

507
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,860
What have you been up to?

508
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,240
Going to college.I'm taking journalism classes.

509
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,220
Having lots of sex.

510
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,170
Oh,and my mom had her appendix out last week.

511
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,010
That'S...wow.

512
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,600
It's so good to see you again.

513
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,470
It's weird,though,

514
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,740
because I was thinking about you just the other day.

515
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,960
Oh,yeah?What about?

516
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,030
Well,I was walking to class,

517
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,620
and all of a sudden,I thought,

518
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,540
"I should have had sex with mouth."

519
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,570
Isn't that weird?

520
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,880
Yeah,that is weird.

521
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,330
Did I mention that I have a girlfriend?

522
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,220
-Cool. -I do,too.

523
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,360
Sometimes.

524
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,530
So,nathan told me about the capes.

525
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,950
You are officially the world's greatest godmother,

526
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,260
and you've totally made jamie's year.

527
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,820
Thank you so much,brooke.

528
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,390
At least I ade one kid happy today.

529
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,250
What happened?

530
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,830
I was gonna talk to sam last night like you said.

531
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,730
And she never showed.

532
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,620
And I just told herI can't help her anymore.

533
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,510
- I'm sorry,haley. - No,no.

534
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,560
I should not have forced her on you.

535
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,560
I just thought...

536
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,360
if anyone could handle her,you could,

537
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:28,510
because you were a lot like her,and you got past it.

538
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:31,160
I thought she could,too,if somebody gave her a chance.

539
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,690
Well,I guess I'm not strong enough.

540
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,090
Brooke,you -- you're the strongest person I know.

541
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,500
You just gave up amultimillion-dollar corporation,

542
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,520
and you seem fine about it.

543
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,460
I wish I had your strength.

544
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,770
My strength?

545
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,240
Haley,you gave up your singing career to be with nathan,

546
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:54,140
who was at least as screwed up as me or sam

547
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,410
when you got a hold of him.

548
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,910
And now he's the best guy I know.

549
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,760
Look,it was scary.

550
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:06,560
I was scared to death to give up the company.

551
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,130
But it wasn't fun anymore.

552
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,440
And now I get to do what I fell in love with --

553
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,170
design clothes on my terms.

554
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,920
Yeah.That sounds familiar.

555
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:25,760
I met a girl who sing son the street every day for fun.

556
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:29,300
It's amazing.She seems so happy.

557
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,190
Music used to belike that for me,

558
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,740
and it's just not anymore.

559
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,900
You know?

560
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,520
Well,then you need to make it fun again.

561
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:42,120
Find what you loved about it and start there.

562
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,480
You're too strong not to.

563
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:50,700
I will think about it.

564
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,410
Okay.

565
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,360
You're definitely done with sam?

566
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,000
I'll think about it.

567
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,740
Oh,that's just not fair.

568
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,420
What are you talking about?

569
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,600
Oh,you know what?It's dark in my room,

570
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,780
so I was just gonna crash early.

571
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,060
All by myself.

572
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,790
Well,it's nice and bright in my room.

573
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,010
Thought I'd do a little reading before bed.

574
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,130
Maybe you should re-read your book

575
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,810
and think about the comet and how close it is,

576
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:41,140
but you can't touch it,'cause you're stubborn.

577
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,550
Maybe I will.

578
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,030
I love my book.

579
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,300
Good,good.

580
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,980
I love sleeping naked.

581
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,470
Damn,she's good.

582
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,400
And then daddy jumped 8 feet and 
dunk the ball.

583
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,720
I was the most popular kid in school.

584
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:06,080
I even got six girls' digitslike uncle skills taught me.

585
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,220
Really?Uncle skills?

586
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:10,290
Well,I'll be having a conversation with uncle skills.

587
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,000
Get used to being popular.You're a scott boy.

588
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,450
Mama,why don't you wear your poncho anymore?

589
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,760
I think one day,I just out grew it.

590
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,960
Good night,buddy.

591
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,100
Good night.

592
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,900
I haven't told you how proud of you I am

593
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:32,240
for walking away today.

594
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,020
I didn't want to,

595
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,240
but you said it would make me tough.

596
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,440
It does.

597
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,000
It took me a long time to learn that lesson.

598
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,720
Those kids teased you about your cape,and you wore it anyway.

599
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:47,950
They wanted to fight you,and you just walked away.

600
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,660
See,there's leaders,and there's followers,

601
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:53,970
and you are a leader.

602
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,720
I wouldn't have fought him,but he said quentin was stupid,

603
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,470
and quentin was not stupid.

604
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,380
Quentin was my friend.

605
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,130
That's right.He was your friend.

606
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,460
And he would beproud of you,too.

607
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,840
good night,buddy.

608
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:48,980
trust me,back seats are not meant for sleeping.

609
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,970
What are you doing here?

610
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:56,080
I thought I'd crash at your place tonight.

611
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,010
I know what it feels like

612
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,290
to have parents who give up on you.

613
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,790
I had one who ignored me,and one who resented me.

614
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,500
And sometimes,I feel like I'd be better off

615
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,860
if I never had parents at all.

616
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,400
No,you wouldn'T.

617
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:14,560
Sam,I don't want to make the same mistakes our parents made.

618
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,730
I want you to move in with me

619
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,650
on an official foster-home basis

620
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,730
if you want to.

621
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,140
What's the catch?

622
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,660
There's no catch.

623
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,790
There are rules.

624
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,120
Breakfastis at 7:00 A.M. Sharp.

625
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,100
And no more stealing --

626
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:38,780
my stuff or anyone else's,but mostly mine.

627
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,370
Deal?

628
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,630
Deal.

629
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:56,270
That is the last thing.

630
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,100
I promise.

631
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,330
What you did for jamie was amazing.

632
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,320
I didn't do that for jamie.

633
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,470
I did that for chuck's mom.

634
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,430
I was afraid you were gonna kill her.

635
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,800
Well,you saved the day for everyone,

636
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,100
like a big old superhero.

637
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,500
You don't need a side kick,do you?

638
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,660
A sidekick?

639
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,720
No.Oh!

640
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,370
No,I think tomorrow I'll go back to being

641
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,940
mild-mannered slam-ball playerna than scott.

642
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,060
I wouldn't call youmild-mannered.

643
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,100
What about you?What are you doing tomorrow?

644
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,740
I think I'm in the mood to do some singing.

645
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,300
It's about time.

646
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,500
I tell you to stay,and you disappear.

647
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,690
I tell you to get lost,and you're at my doorstep.

648
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,890
Apparently you have everything backwards,so come on in.

649
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,070
Wait,wait,wait.Hey,can --

650
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,990
- can we talk? - Sure.

651
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,630
How have you been?There,we talked.

652
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,760
Now,if you don't mind,it's late,

653
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,300
and I havea young girl sleeping inside.

654
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,830
I just want a chance to explain myself.

655
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,490
Fine.

656
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,270
Explain.

657
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:16,440
Look,I got freaked out when you mentioned the baby.

658
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,940
I had a horrible childhood.

659
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:22,460
Then I get addicted to heroin really early on.

660
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:26,170
Now I avoid anything more responsible than making drinks.

661
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,600
The thought of me being a father is just too much.

662
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:34,680
I never asked youto be the father.

663
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,390
I know.

664
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,470
But if you ever did.

665
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,070
I know I wouldn't be any good at it.

666
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,070
So I disappeared.

667
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,610
And you have every right to be mad at me.

668
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,570
And I'm sorry.

669
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,830
Have you ever considered

670
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,000
that going through all those awful experiences

671
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:01,180
is exactly what would make youa good father someday?

672
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,660
I've seen you be responsable with rachel

673
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,650
and care with jamie.

674
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,230
You even brought sam home,

675
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,340
and she's a total stranger to you.

676
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,460
Well,truth be told,

677
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,770
I just brought her home'cause I wanted to see you.

678
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,710
Okay,well,if she's at the bar tonight,

679
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,600
then bring her home,and you will see me again.

680
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,070
Then I hope she'sin the drinking mood.

681
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,240
But if not,

682
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,740
then I hope the real brooke davis will stop by.

683
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:41,080
I promise you,I won't go anywhere this time.

684
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,640
I'll think about it.

685
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,870
Jerk.

686
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,970
you know,I read somewhere

687
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,360
that you should never go to bed angry.

688
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,980
Now,it wasn't B. Davis magazine,

689
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,900
so I'm not sureif it's very valid.

690
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,630
I'm not angry.

691
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,410
In fact,I've actually had fun these last few daysplaying around.

692
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,860
Especially sinceI've been winning.

693
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,810
Well...before you get too excited,

694
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,780
may I remind you

695
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:48,070
that your moving boxes were on my side of the line.

696
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,250
What'd you do?

697
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,610
Well,I just unpacked some of your stuff.

698
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,390
I found a really great picture to replace the one of lindsey.

699
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,790
Oh,luke,that is sweet.

700
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,310
Of course you went through my art again

701
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,090
without asking permission.

702
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,470
My side,my art,babe.

703
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,200
I think I'm starting to like your side better.

704
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:13,190
I was about to say the same thing.

705
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,100
Let's be on the same side again.

706
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,690
I really have to go to the bathroom.

707
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,020
Oh,my god,I'm starving.

708
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,020
Mm,somebody smells good.Hot date?

709
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,540
No? Why?It's just work.

710
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:36,200
Touchy,touchy.I'm just saying you smell good.

711
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,560
I'd say you look good,too,but I don't want to get hit.

712
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,140
Well,go ahead.Risk it.

713
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,230
So how was your first day back?

714
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,410
Was everyone happy to see you?

715
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,400
Some of them.

716
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,840
Well,I'm thrilled to have you back.

717
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,620
So do you have yournew tree hill catch phrase yet?

718
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,110
I don't think I'm gonna need one.

719
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,170
Oh,sure you will.

720
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,160
How about"mouthing off from the hill"?

721
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,410
No.

722
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,320
"If a tree falls,your mouth will make a sound"?

723
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,010
Please stop.

724
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,780
- Or what about - how's this?

725
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,200
"I'm marvin mcfadden,

727

732
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,810
That's a cute kid.

733
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,840
Well,kid,anyway.

734
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:23,900
You know,I hear he and jamie

735
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,330
got in a little scufflethe other day.

736
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,760
I sure hope they work it out.

737
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,780
You know what?I think they already have.

738
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,590
You know,I'd love to join you for your morning drink,

739
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,490
but I'm late for a meeting with my parole officer.

740
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,910
Murder.

741
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,590
Hey! Tell me you're on your way to the studio

742
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,330
to make your new record.

743
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,290
Uh,actually,

744
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,880
I was thinking about doing singing for fun today.

745
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,600
What do you think?You up for a duet?

746
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:00,290

Great.What do you want to play?

748
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,830
Uh,how about this one?

749
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:18,930
I'm a girl with the best intentions

750
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,700
something I should probably mention

751
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,490
I like to get just what I pay for

752
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,740
so I pay and I getand I pay and I want some more

753
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,400

00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:41,270

755
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,290
somethingI tell myself I need

756
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,440
something that I want

757
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:51,270
I need everything I see

758
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:58,320
I'm a girl who's got a notion

00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,450

760
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:04,480

761
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:10,120

762
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:16,340

763

766
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,320
It's a start.

767
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,870
Breakfast!

768
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,440
Well,your stuff is unpacked.

769
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,130
The tape is gone.

770
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,830
And the house is officially both of ours.

771
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,250
Perfect timing.

772
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,780
I made waffles.

773
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,030
- I love waffles. - I do,too.

774
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,390
Plus,I got the recipe from B. Davis magazine,

776
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,580
You better enjoy them,because,um...

777
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,830

778
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,680
What?!

779
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,640
Holy cow.

780
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,140
I forgot there was a world out side the house.

781
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,950

785
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,060
Do you wantto play kickball?

786
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,110
You can be on my team.

787
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,310
Whoa,chuck,slow your roll.

788
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,230
Maybe another time.

789
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,820
Why aren't you wearingyour cape?

790
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:33,640
