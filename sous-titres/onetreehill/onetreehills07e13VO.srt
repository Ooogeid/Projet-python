1
00:00:01,715 --> 00:00:03,689
I said terrible things to Alex.

2
00:00:03,772 --> 00:00:06,148
I stole the dress from
you, and I'm just sorry.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,309
You are not my model any more.

4
00:00:08,497 --> 00:00:10,318
If you gonna sign with
me, you need to know that

5
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:13,974
I plan on falling completely
and insanely in love with Quinn.

6
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:18,142
The record company wants me to tour

7
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:19,376
in support of my new album.

8
00:00:19,459 --> 00:00:22,279
I'm supposed to leave next week.

9
00:00:22,362 --> 00:00:24,609
I think you should take another movie.

10
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,269
And what about us?

11
00:00:26,352 --> 00:00:28,269
I'm saying I need some time.

12
00:00:28,352 --> 00:00:29,304
Alex!

13
00:00:29,387 --> 00:00:30,792
Hey! Alex!

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,043
Let's make our movie.

15
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,460
I'm Alexander Coyne.

16
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:41,076
I'm your new designer.

17
00:00:47,408 --> 00:00:49,143
Don't call it a comeback

18
00:00:49,226 --> 00:00:50,770
She's been here for years

19
00:00:50,853 --> 00:00:52,731
rockin' her peers and
puttin' suckas in fear.

20
00:00:52,814 --> 00:00:54,462
I'm gonna knock you out.

21
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:56,459
Mama said knock you out.

22
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:58,491
I'm gonna knock you out.

23
00:00:58,574 --> 00:01:00,539
Mama said knock you out.

24
00:01:02,473 --> 00:01:04,290
Okay.

25
00:01:04,373 --> 00:01:05,490
Good luck, mom.

26
00:01:05,573 --> 00:01:06,788
Thanks, baby.

27
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:08,955
Good luck.

28
00:01:09,038 --> 00:01:10,968
Remember it's Cleveland!

29
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:25,552
* Be safe and close, darlin' *

30
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:29,688
* your heart is precious to me *

31
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:36,522
* when you are exploring,
remember all you see *

32
00:01:36,605 --> 00:01:40,122
* is only the view of the world *

33
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:42,974
* from your flying machine *

34
00:01:57,981 --> 00:02:01,995
* so distant you wander *

35
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,630
* you've lost your way, it seems *

36
00:02:05,713 --> 00:02:09,133
* pretending you're happy *

37
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:12,335
* nobody else believes *

38
00:02:12,418 --> 00:02:16,205
* you're ever going to come down *

39
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:18,840
* from your flying machine *

40
00:02:18,923 --> 00:02:21,208
Clothes For Bros,

41
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,772
COB's first venture into men's design.

42
00:02:23,855 --> 00:02:25,806
And to help launch our new line,

43
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:29,141
I'd like to introduce you to
our new creative consultant,

44
00:02:29,224 --> 00:02:31,776
and my co-designer, Alexander Coyne.

45
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:33,326
Thank you, Brooke. Happy to be here.

46
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,012
* That blackbird, that robin *

47
00:02:38,095 --> 00:02:41,147
* that tiny honeybee *

48
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,417
* I miss you, my lover *

49
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,319
* you've gone through space
and time to search for... *

50
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:53,670
So, how are you feeling today?

51
00:02:57,674 --> 00:03:00,593
Better than yesterday.

52
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:03,510
That's all you can ask for.

53
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:18,472
These days you aren't
keeping distinguished company

54
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:25,044
* The blackbird, the
robin, that tiny honeybee *

55
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:29,380
* I miss you, my lover *

56
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:32,698
* You've gone through space and time *

57
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:36,719
* To search for another *

58
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:39,556
* won't you... *

59
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:43,025
* Leave all the others behind *

60
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:45,442
You're good. So am I.

61
00:03:52,414 --> 00:03:55,900
* Hold onto your hats,
watch out for black cats *

62
00:03:55,983 --> 00:04:05,273
* all this bewitching
has taken my lover away *

63
00:04:05,356 --> 00:04:07,173
* you're just precious to me *

64
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:14,078
* when you are exploring,
remember all you see *

65
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:22,066
* is only the view of the
world from your flying machine *

66
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:30,388
Six weeks of mail.

67
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:32,623
Six weeks of junk.

68
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,092
See, this is the inside of the tour bus.

69
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:37,627
And I had a bunk bed
with a pull-down tv.

70
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,430
And one night they made
me an honorary roadie.

71
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,064
Whoa!

72
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:43,165
Us roadies do all the real work.

73
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:45,068
Hey, I heard that.

74
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,907
This is so cool, Jamie.

75
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,842
So, are you coming to the show
tonight? It's the last one.

76
00:04:48,925 --> 00:04:50,144
You bet I am.

77
00:04:50,227 --> 00:04:51,980
Cool. You can meet my road dogs.

78
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:54,583
See you later, buddy.

79
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:58,454
I swear he'd rather
live on that tour bus.

80
00:04:58,537 --> 00:04:59,703
That's for you.

81
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:22,186
Tastes like three.

82
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,207
Uh...

83
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,608
Calliope.

84
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:27,842
God bless you.

85
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:29,643
Um, my daughter is flying back today.

86
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:32,045
We need to make a good impression,
like answering the phone.

87
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:34,582
Oh, of course, Ms. Davis.

88
00:05:34,665 --> 00:05:36,751
The phone. Answer it.

89
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:39,386
Oh! Yes.

90
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:41,688
Clothes Over Bros.

91
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:43,456
Millicent?

92
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:46,459
I'm sorry, she doesn't
work here anymore.

93
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:48,394
Millicent Huxtable,

94
00:05:48,477 --> 00:05:51,464
you are before this court
on a drunk-driving charge.

95
00:05:51,547 --> 00:05:53,533
Driving drunk is a selfish crime,

96
00:05:53,616 --> 00:05:55,635
and this court has no tolerance for it.

97
00:05:55,718 --> 00:05:58,338
You are heading down a dangerous path.

98
00:05:58,421 --> 00:06:02,076
Now, I understand you
were just recently fired.

99
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:03,511
You don't have a job...

100
00:06:03,594 --> 00:06:04,846
Your Honor...

101
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:05,895
She does have a job.

102
00:06:07,297 --> 00:06:08,916
She works for me.

103
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:10,750
You work for me, remember?

104
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,185
I know, boss.

105
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:14,054
I just... I think the
board liked me better.

106
00:06:14,137 --> 00:06:17,790
They like your track record
of making a butt-load of money,

107
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:19,092
and...

108
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:20,995
Julian?

109
00:06:21,078 --> 00:06:22,063
Brooke.

110
00:06:22,146 --> 00:06:23,097
Hi.

111
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,665
Hi.

112
00:06:24,748 --> 00:06:26,800
Hi. Alexander Coyne.

113
00:06:26,883 --> 00:06:28,435
Julian Baker.

114
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:30,603
It's... it's been...

115
00:06:30,686 --> 00:06:31,804
six weeks.

116
00:06:31,887 --> 00:06:33,005
We haven't talked in six weeks, Brooke.

117
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:35,574
How did you know I
was coming home today?

118
00:06:35,657 --> 00:06:38,009
I'm okay. And I didn't.

119
00:06:38,092 --> 00:06:39,177
Oh. Then why are you...

120
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,746
Julian!

121
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:42,447
Sorry. The flight was late.

122
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,149
I swear that ratty airline
blanket gave me cooties.

123
00:06:45,232 --> 00:06:46,950
Of course.

124
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,418
Hey, Brooke.

125
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:50,402
Alex.

126
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:53,371
Bye, Julian.

127
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:04,902
I told you. No spiders... nothing.

128
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:05,878
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:07,547
I just haven't slept
in this bed in weeks.

130
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,083
Ugh, it happened one time when
we got home from sleepaway camp.

131
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,351
One time, eight legs,

132
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:13,052
and a friggin' hundred nightmares later!

133
00:07:13,135 --> 00:07:16,022
Ugh, bed, I've missed you.

134
00:07:16,105 --> 00:07:18,390
I missed my favorite baby sis!

135
00:07:18,473 --> 00:07:21,060
So...

136
00:07:21,143 --> 00:07:22,661
the thing in the mail...

137
00:07:22,744 --> 00:07:24,396
is that what I think it is?

138
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,530
Yeah.

139
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,899
I'm divorced... officially.

140
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:29,566
Are you okay?

141
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,635
I've been divorced for a while now.

142
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,670
The paper just makes it official.

143
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,505
Clay probably makes it easier.

144
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,821
What's up with you two?

145
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,543
We're good, you know?

146
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,278
I haven't seen him in a couple of weeks.

147
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:44,047
He's been out scouting,
but we texted all the time.

148
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,916
He comes home today.

149
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,551
And you're totally nervous,

150
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,053
because you're doing that
"I like a boy" face twitch.

151
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,955
Face twitch. What...

152
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,623
like...

153
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:54,940
Shut up, Hales!

154
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,994
It's cute, really.

155
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,797
Fine. Good luck with the black
widow I saw on your pillow.

156
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,347
What?!

157
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,302
I hate you.

158
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:07,870
I know you don't do
something for nothing,

159
00:08:07,953 --> 00:08:10,006
so what do you want, Victoria?

160
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,709
I'm sorry, does that mean
"thank you" in coke-whore land?

161
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:17,579
Yes, I know about your little habit...

162
00:08:17,662 --> 00:08:19,214
And your sad, little compulsion

163
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:22,417
to take dresses that
don't belong to you.

164
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,052
Are you still doing the drugs?

165
00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:25,320
Today? No.

166
00:08:25,403 --> 00:08:26,487
No or not yet?

167
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,755
Are we done here?

168
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:29,123
I'm sorry to hold you.

169
00:08:29,206 --> 00:08:31,024
You must have mirrors to clean.

170
00:08:31,107 --> 00:08:33,625
Look, I meant what I said in there.

171
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,161
You can come back to
clothes over bros...

172
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:37,911
As my assistant.

173
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:42,547
Why would you help me?

174
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,837
Because, clearly, you need it.

175
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,339
Look, it's a second chance,

176
00:08:47,422 --> 00:08:50,456
and believe me, they don't
come around that often.

177
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:54,059
The choice is yours.

178
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:00,883
Jamie, come on.

179
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:02,418
Sorry, dad.

180
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:05,354
Had to get my tour-bus book
to show Chuck and the guys.

181
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:07,671
Bet they've never even see.

182
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:10,991
Clay!

183
00:09:11,074 --> 00:09:12,159
Hey, Nate. What's up, man?

184
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:14,160
- Uncle Clay!
- What's up, buddy?

185
00:09:14,243 --> 00:09:16,495
Aunt Quinn, uncle Clay's here!

186
00:09:16,578 --> 00:09:18,263
Dude, got to tell you about the tour.

187
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:20,031
Later, okay? I'll be in the car, dad.

188
00:09:20,114 --> 00:09:21,498
All right, Jamie.

189
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:22,965
So, when'd you get in, man?

190
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:24,399
Landed this morning.

191
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:26,901
I wanted to deliver the
endorsement contracts in person.

192
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,902
Oh... thanks, man.

193
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,536
Just taking care of my client.

194
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:32,671
Clay, you're home!

195
00:09:32,754 --> 00:09:33,753
Hey, there.

196
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,576
Uh, well, Jamie's waiting.

197
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:40,509
So, I... I better go. I'll see you guys.

198
00:09:40,592 --> 00:09:41,527
Bye, Nate.

199
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:45,163
Welcome home.

200
00:09:53,705 --> 00:09:55,057
Oh.

201
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,092
I'm more of a vodka girl,

202
00:09:57,175 --> 00:09:58,893
and we have a lot of work to do.

203
00:09:58,976 --> 00:10:00,127
And we can do it later.

204
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,028
Hey, we worked our
asses off for six weeks,

205
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,496
and the board loved the pitch.

206
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:05,098
It's gonna be a hit.

207
00:10:05,181 --> 00:10:06,466
Oh, come on.

208
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:07,934
A smile would be nice.

209
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:10,117
One sip.

210
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:16,590
Hit me.

211
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:22,285
Um, so, what's the deal
with you, that Julian guy,

212
00:10:22,368 --> 00:10:23,519
and the hot girl?

213
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:25,522
Do you like your job?

214
00:10:25,605 --> 00:10:26,924
Uh, yeah.

215
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:29,059
Then don't call skanky
Alex "the hot girl,"

216
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:30,827
and don't ask me about Julian.

217
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,462
Okay, sorry, it's just that, you know,

218
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:34,196
we've been working together
nonstop for weeks now,

219
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,664
and all I know about you

220
00:10:35,747 --> 00:10:37,466
is that you like to order
Chinese after midnight

221
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:39,969
and you sketch well.

222
00:10:40,052 --> 00:10:41,337
You sketch great.

223
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,305
Really great. Come on.

224
00:10:43,388 --> 00:10:46,409
Hey, I talk to you about
my girlfriends all the time.

225
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:48,077
I would hardly call

226
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,713
your one-night stands " girlfriends."

227
00:10:50,796 --> 00:10:52,915
And I don't want to talk.

228
00:10:52,998 --> 00:10:54,417
Okay? I want to work.

229
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,153
It's what I do when I'm pissed off.

230
00:10:56,236 --> 00:10:57,923
Yeah, well, especially with guys...

231
00:10:58,006 --> 00:11:00,374
hence the whole Clothes
Over Bros empire.

232
00:11:01,843 --> 00:11:03,362
Look, Brooke,

233
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:04,730
I know it's not my place,

234
00:11:04,813 --> 00:11:07,833
but, I mean, your work
should be your passion,

235
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,951
not a place you hide
when your love life sucks.

236
00:11:11,052 --> 00:11:14,673
Well, my sucky love life has
made me a very rich girl...

237
00:11:14,756 --> 00:11:16,908
rich enough to afford you.

238
00:11:16,991 --> 00:11:19,577
So, how 'bout you help
me and earn your keep?

239
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,978
Whatever you say, boss.

240
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:23,347
I like it when you call me "boss."

241
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,065
Well, I'm glad, boss.

242
00:11:29,203 --> 00:11:30,921
You know, that guy's a fool, by the way.

243
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:32,590
That sucky love-life guy.

244
00:11:32,673 --> 00:11:36,475
I mean, what kind of idiot
treats Brooke Davis poorly?

245
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:44,801
You've been so sweet to me. Thanks.

246
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:47,237
First-class treatment
for the star of my movie.

247
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,739
I need you rested and
ready to shoot next week.

248
00:11:49,822 --> 00:11:51,975
Aye aye, captain.

249
00:11:52,058 --> 00:11:54,277
You're just a washed-up actress

250
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,880
that's too dumb to realize
she's chasing after a boy

251
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:58,382
that has no interest in her.

252
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:00,149
You okay? I could call room service,

253
00:12:00,232 --> 00:12:02,550
get you some food, tea.

254
00:12:02,633 --> 00:12:05,167
No, I'm fine. Just, uh...
just taking it all in.

255
00:12:07,303 --> 00:12:10,890
Souvenirs from "Stupid land."

256
00:12:10,973 --> 00:12:11,924
I didn't mean to stare.

257
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:13,158
It's okay.

258
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:15,427
No more talk about me.

259
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,262
I don't know if you know this,

260
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:18,763
but I used to be self-centered.

261
00:12:18,846 --> 00:12:21,814
I was so "me, me, me,
and my fab ass... me."

262
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:24,133
I never noticed.

263
00:12:24,216 --> 00:12:26,936
Okay, I'm gonna go, let you settle in.

264
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:28,070
Uh, I'll be on my cell if you need...

265
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:29,237
Don't worry.

266
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,539
I'm good. I promise.

267
00:12:31,622 --> 00:12:33,107
Okay. Bye.

268
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,724
Bye.

269
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:49,704
Hey, Makenna. Where's the party?

270
00:12:57,584 --> 00:13:00,204
Life on the road was sweet.

271
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:04,174
It was rock 'n' roll
city to city, you know?

272
00:13:04,257 --> 00:13:06,275
Chillin' with my road dogs.

273
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:09,543
One time, the bus driver
even let me drive the bus.

274
00:13:09,626 --> 00:13:11,311
You told us.

275
00:13:11,394 --> 00:13:14,013
Three times. You're on a loop, dude.

276
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:15,781
Let's go.

277
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:17,483
Hey, where are you going?

278
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:20,753
Uh... karate practice.

279
00:13:20,836 --> 00:13:22,521
Like we do every Saturday.

280
00:13:22,604 --> 00:13:24,439
Our sensei is a time nazi.

281
00:13:26,274 --> 00:13:28,505
I'm glad you're back, Jamie.

282
00:13:35,645 --> 00:13:38,298
Welcome back.

283
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:40,601
It would have been nice to get a call...

284
00:13:40,684 --> 00:13:42,636
E-mail, anything.

285
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:44,805
We're taking some time apart.

286
00:13:44,888 --> 00:13:46,773
And I backed off for six weeks, but...

287
00:13:46,856 --> 00:13:48,175
We need to talk now.

288
00:13:48,258 --> 00:13:50,544
We need to figure some
things out together.

289
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:53,246
If this is about you not
being able to have kids,

290
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:55,315
we should be talking about that.

291
00:13:55,398 --> 00:13:57,951
We should be talking
about a lot of things.

292
00:13:58,034 --> 00:14:00,902
Things like Alex?

293
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:05,525
How is she, by the way?
Seems to be on the mend.

294
00:14:05,608 --> 00:14:07,126
You want to talk about Alex?

295
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:08,661
Okay.

296
00:14:08,744 --> 00:14:11,597
You told me that you want to save her,

297
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,533
like you couldn't save your mom.

298
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:16,968
What am I supposed to do with that?

299
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:18,603
Understand.

300
00:14:18,686 --> 00:14:21,139
I can't!

301
00:14:21,222 --> 00:14:22,473
Oh, I see.

302
00:14:22,556 --> 00:14:25,043
So since you can't understand
me working with Alex,

303
00:14:25,126 --> 00:14:27,145
you show up in town with some guy

304
00:14:27,228 --> 00:14:28,779
like we're playing a game?

305
00:14:28,862 --> 00:14:30,781
I'm not playing a game.

306
00:14:30,864 --> 00:14:31,982
Really?

307
00:14:32,065 --> 00:14:35,118
You show up with a guy named Alexander.

308
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:37,020
"Alex"?

309
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:39,022
Right. No game here.

310
00:14:39,105 --> 00:14:42,125
My mother hired Alexander.

311
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:45,394
He is consulting on my men's line!

312
00:14:45,477 --> 00:14:46,796
That's it!

313
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,164
Okay. I believe you.

314
00:14:49,247 --> 00:14:50,532
Imagine that.

315
00:14:50,615 --> 00:14:53,167
I believe you.

316
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,370
Do you think that this
has been easy for me?

317
00:14:56,453 --> 00:14:59,106
How would I know, Brooke?
You never talk to me about it!

318
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,540
I've tried...

319
00:15:00,623 --> 00:15:01,909
you know what? I can't do this.

320
00:15:01,992 --> 00:15:03,577
I have a lot of work to do today.

321
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,379
Right. Of course.

322
00:15:06,462 --> 00:15:08,262
Clothes over bros.

323
00:15:17,371 --> 00:15:19,256
What happened to all your friends?

324
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:20,390
I don't know.

325
00:15:20,473 --> 00:15:21,625
I tried to tell them about my summer,

326
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,059
but they shut me down.

327
00:15:23,142 --> 00:15:25,228
Yeah? What did they
do with their summer?

328
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:27,030
I don't know.

329
00:15:27,113 --> 00:15:29,599
Did you ask, or did
you do all the talking?

330
00:15:29,682 --> 00:15:32,802
I guess I was bragging a little bit.

331
00:15:32,885 --> 00:15:35,237
Yeah.

332
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,573
Look, Jamie, you get to
do a lot of cool stuff

333
00:15:37,656 --> 00:15:39,641
that other kids don't really get to do.

334
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:41,310
NBA games. Rock tours.

335
00:15:41,393 --> 00:15:43,645
But the thing is, none
of that stuff matters

336
00:15:43,728 --> 00:15:44,994
more than your friends.

337
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:47,748
You know all my friends, right?

338
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:49,049
They're pretty much all the same friends

339
00:15:49,132 --> 00:15:50,132
that I've had for a really long time.

340
00:15:52,268 --> 00:15:54,453
Was skills always bald?

341
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,256
Yeah. Pretty much.

342
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:00,694
My point is, no matter how
much cool stuff I get to do,

343
00:16:00,777 --> 00:16:02,796
none of it matters without my friends.

344
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,913
All right?

345
00:16:10,787 --> 00:16:13,407
Knock, knock! Tickets, anyone?

346
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,774
Haley! Hey.

347
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:16,875
You could have left these at will call.

348
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,243
I can't leave a hug at will call.

349
00:16:18,326 --> 00:16:20,378
- Missed you.
- Missed you, too.

350
00:16:20,461 --> 00:16:23,548
So, excessive sketching.
What's been going on?

351
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:25,383
Nothing.

352
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:26,751
Brooke.

353
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:29,521
It's me and Julian. I...

354
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:32,291
I thought that this time
apart was gonna help,

355
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:34,360
and I just feel stuck.

356
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:37,030
Brooke, Julian loves
you, and you love him.

357
00:16:37,113 --> 00:16:39,065
That is a good place to be stuck.

358
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:40,967
Yeah.

359
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,084
But this thing with Alex, Hales...

360
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,242
Did you ever doubt
Nathan, even for a second,

361
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:50,545
during that whole mess with Renee?

362
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:52,947
I'm not proud of it, but, yeah, I did.

363
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,716
And he kept telling me the
whole time that it was nothing.

364
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,986
Guess what... in the
end, it was nothing.

365
00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:00,689
Yeah, but you're Nathan and Haley.

366
00:17:00,772 --> 00:17:03,225
Brooke, I know trust has
always been hard for you.

367
00:17:03,308 --> 00:17:06,811
But Alex isn't Peyton.
And Julian is not Lucas.

368
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,035
Want to know a secret?

369
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:11,985
Huh?

370
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:15,338
I'm kind of nervous.

371
00:17:15,421 --> 00:17:16,672
Why?

372
00:17:16,755 --> 00:17:18,273
I don't know. Because...

373
00:17:18,356 --> 00:17:20,307
'cause I haven't seen you, and...

374
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,624
You give me butterflies...
there. I said it!

375
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:25,426
I was nervous, too.

376
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:27,613
Really?

377
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:29,380
Yeah.

378
00:17:29,463 --> 00:17:31,246
After that whole public declaration

379
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:33,545
about falling insanely in love with you?

380
00:17:33,628 --> 00:17:35,280
Great line, by the way.

381
00:17:35,363 --> 00:17:36,648
Really?

382
00:17:36,731 --> 00:17:38,916
I was afraid that might
have freaked you out.

383
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:42,653
No. It was amazing... so romantic.

384
00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:45,189
And a big, huge moment.

385
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,890
That totally freaked you out.

386
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:48,191
A little

387
00:17:48,274 --> 00:17:50,594
but only because it had
the potential to be true.

388
00:17:50,677 --> 00:17:54,264
Or it has the potential to be true.

389
00:17:54,347 --> 00:17:57,934
I tell you what. Let's take things slow.

390
00:17:58,017 --> 00:18:01,471
No pressure. No more
big public declarations.

391
00:18:01,554 --> 00:18:03,139
Let's start small...

392
00:18:03,222 --> 00:18:04,289
Like a date.

393
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,543
I could do a date.

394
00:18:07,626 --> 00:18:09,145
Good.

395
00:18:09,228 --> 00:18:11,997
And then after the date, we
can fall insanely in love.

396
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:16,252
I could do that, too.

397
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:18,870
What are you doing for lunch?

398
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,763
Hello, Julian.

399
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:28,698
I hear the chicken's good today.

400
00:18:28,781 --> 00:18:30,900
Brooke and I are taking some time apart.

401
00:18:30,983 --> 00:18:33,135
I don't need you pushing
another guy on her.

402
00:18:33,218 --> 00:18:35,304
I'm not pushing anything.

403
00:18:35,387 --> 00:18:36,372
Victoria...

404
00:18:36,455 --> 00:18:37,706
Julian...

405
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:40,576
I like you.

406
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:42,578
But Brooke deserves to be with someone

407
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:44,313
who has the good sense to want her

408
00:18:44,396 --> 00:18:46,048
over some no-talent actress.

409
00:18:46,131 --> 00:18:48,083
Well, if that's Alexander, then...

410
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,186
I'm not interested in Alex.

411
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:51,920
I've seen you with her.

412
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:54,390
You may not be interested in her,

413
00:18:54,473 --> 00:18:57,426
but you like that
she's interested in you.

414
00:18:57,509 --> 00:19:00,095
You want to stroke your ego?

415
00:19:00,178 --> 00:19:02,730
Don't break my
daughter's heart to do it.

416
00:19:02,813 --> 00:19:04,498
Brooke's heart was already broken

417
00:19:04,581 --> 00:19:05,733
when I met her.

418
00:19:05,816 --> 00:19:07,401
But you know that since you broke it.

419
00:19:07,484 --> 00:19:09,104
I've been the one trying to mend it.

420
00:19:09,187 --> 00:19:11,540
Well, right now, you're
not doing a good job.

421
00:19:11,623 --> 00:19:12,974
You want Brooke?

422
00:19:13,057 --> 00:19:15,844
Stand up and be that hero that
you put in all your movies.

423
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:17,279
Fight for her.

424
00:19:17,362 --> 00:19:19,881
I have been. I can't
fight for us by myself.

425
00:19:19,964 --> 00:19:21,683
Look...

426
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:23,885
Victoria, I'm not the bad guy here.

427
00:19:23,968 --> 00:19:26,569
You want to help your
daughter? Tell her that.

428
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:43,003
Hey, bitch.

429
00:19:43,086 --> 00:19:45,238
I thought you, like, died or something.

430
00:19:45,321 --> 00:19:47,140
No. That was your career.

431
00:19:47,223 --> 00:19:49,209
Damn. It was a joke. Chill.

432
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:50,577
Where's Millie?

433
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,128
I don't know. Call
1-800-snow nose.

434
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:03,923
What are you doing?!

435
00:20:04,006 --> 00:20:05,324
- Taking you home.
- Why?

436
00:20:05,407 --> 00:20:07,226
Because nobody did it for me.

437
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:09,228
Let's go.

438
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:11,763
You did your good deed. Now you can go.

439
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:14,000
No, I'm coming in. We need to talk.

440
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,216
Fine. Come in.

441
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,205
My God, Millie!

442
00:20:19,288 --> 00:20:21,155
Screw you, Alex.

443
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:33,731
Wow.

444
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:36,249
Olives, cheddar bunnies,
and brownie bites.

445
00:20:37,384 --> 00:20:39,971
And root beer.

446
00:20:40,054 --> 00:20:43,106
I am such a cheap first date.

447
00:20:43,189 --> 00:20:44,808
You know, I haven't
been home in a few weeks.

448
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:46,976
There wasn't a whole lot
in the kitchen to work with.

449
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:49,379
Yeah, with this menu, you're not
really gonna get a first-date kiss.

450
00:20:49,462 --> 00:20:51,314
So you kiss on the first date.

451
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:52,949
Never. Mnh-mnh.

452
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:54,485
So you're a tease.

453
00:20:54,568 --> 00:20:56,887
Oh, and here I was saving
the last brownie bite for you.

454
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,289
No, you don't! What...

455
00:20:58,372 --> 00:20:59,873
mm, mm, mm. Mmm!

456
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:02,826
Mm-hmm.

457
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:03,860
So good.

458
00:21:03,943 --> 00:21:04,894
So tell me...

459
00:21:04,977 --> 00:21:08,197
best first-date story.

460
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,731
Bobby Hobbs.

461
00:21:09,814 --> 00:21:12,834
I was 7, and he invited
me over to play basketball

462
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:14,069
in his driveway.

463
00:21:14,152 --> 00:21:16,637
I was a serious tomboy.

464
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,706
When I got there,

465
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:20,808
he slipped me a note that says,
"will you be my girlfriend?

466
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:23,043
Yes, no, maybe."

467
00:21:23,126 --> 00:21:24,945
Get her done, Bobby Hobbs!

468
00:21:25,028 --> 00:21:26,512
What?

469
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:28,847
Game respects game. So what'd you say?

470
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,081
I said "yes."

471
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,282
And then I beat him in "horse"

472
00:21:31,365 --> 00:21:32,850
and made him cry like a little girl.

473
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:34,633
Remind me never to play ball with you.

474
00:21:39,238 --> 00:21:41,124
So...

475
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:42,692
Today at the house,

476
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:45,262
you seemed kind of awkward
around me in front of Nathan.

477
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,629
Yeah, you know,

478
00:21:46,712 --> 00:21:49,299
I think it's best to keep
it strictly professional

479
00:21:49,382 --> 00:21:50,833
around Nate.

480
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,468
Yeah, but you told him

481
00:21:52,551 --> 00:21:55,237
you plan on falling
insanely in love with me.

482
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,738
Okay.

483
00:21:56,821 --> 00:21:58,773
Doesn't mean I want to
flaunt it in his face.

484
00:21:58,856 --> 00:22:01,375
It... it just felt weird, I guess.

485
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,776
Okay.

486
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:04,044
But if we're gonna date,

487
00:22:04,127 --> 00:22:05,411
have to date outside
of this little world

488
00:22:05,494 --> 00:22:06,579
here at the beach house.

489
00:22:06,662 --> 00:22:08,580
I know.

490
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:10,949
You're right.

491
00:22:11,032 --> 00:22:13,083
You're beautiful, and you're right.

492
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,286
Besides, I hear they
have way better food

493
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,502
in the real world.

494
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,024
Okay, well, I'm gonna go to my hotel,

495
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,524
check , get some sleep.

496
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:24,992
Unless you want to grab dinner,

497
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:26,527
maybe review the designs.

498
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,028
I can't. I have plans.

499
00:22:28,111 --> 00:22:30,331
Oh, so, she doesn't just work.

500
00:22:30,414 --> 00:22:32,165
Well, you're just full
of surprises, Ms. Davis.

501
00:22:32,248 --> 00:22:33,300
Mm. Don't forget,

502
00:22:33,383 --> 00:22:34,667
we have a conference call with New York

503
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,835
tomorrow morning, 10:00 a.m.

504
00:22:35,918 --> 00:22:37,185
Got it.

505
00:22:38,553 --> 00:22:41,073
Got it, boss.

506
00:22:41,156 --> 00:22:43,274
Attaboy.

507
00:22:43,357 --> 00:22:44,842
By the way...

508
00:22:44,925 --> 00:22:47,078
I know I'm here for the "clothes" part,

509
00:22:47,161 --> 00:22:48,779
but I'm also a good listener...

510
00:22:48,862 --> 00:22:51,263
If you ever need to talk
about the "bros" part.

511
00:22:54,867 --> 00:22:56,252
Victoria.

512
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:58,701
Alexander.

513
00:23:01,404 --> 00:23:02,622
He seems interested.

514
00:23:02,705 --> 00:23:05,726
Don't push, mom. It's just work.

515
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:07,895
Honey, I don't want you
to be with Alexander.

516
00:23:07,978 --> 00:23:08,977
I want you to be happy.

517
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,632
Do you still love Julian?

518
00:23:12,715 --> 00:23:14,366
Of course.

519
00:23:14,449 --> 00:23:15,801
Well, he came to see me today,

520
00:23:15,884 --> 00:23:17,803
and I told him to fight for you.

521
00:23:17,886 --> 00:23:19,786
But he has been fighting, hasn't he?

522
00:23:21,655 --> 00:23:23,573
Look...

523
00:23:23,656 --> 00:23:27,225
Don't let this "taking space"
be a long way to "goodbye."

524
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:31,929
Bitchtoria is getting soft.

525
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,750
I know. It's a tragedy.

526
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:37,018
Speaking of tragedies,
I saw Millicent today,

527
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:38,319
and I offered her a job.

528
00:23:38,402 --> 00:23:39,554
Mom...

529
00:23:39,637 --> 00:23:40,955
I know. You're disappointed in her.

530
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:42,523
But I want to help.

531
00:23:42,606 --> 00:23:44,574
I feel... responsible.

532
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,729
I was the one that called the police

533
00:23:47,812 --> 00:23:48,930
the night of the DUI.

534
00:23:49,013 --> 00:23:50,131
Well, you weren't the one

535
00:23:50,214 --> 00:23:51,833
who made Millie get in the driver's seat

536
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,267
and drive drunk!

537
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,169
Mom, her getting pulled over that night

538
00:23:55,252 --> 00:23:56,804
might have saved someone's life!

539
00:23:56,887 --> 00:23:59,255
Well, maybe this will help Millicent.

540
00:24:03,093 --> 00:24:04,544
You're right.

541
00:24:04,627 --> 00:24:07,028
Bitchtoria is really getting soft.

542
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,818
Why are you still here?

543
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:15,487
I'm staying until you talk to me.

544
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,089
Well, God, what do
you want to talk about?

545
00:24:18,172 --> 00:24:20,225
I went to court today for a DUI,

546
00:24:20,308 --> 00:24:22,894
I snort powder up my
nose. And I'm by myself.

547
00:24:22,977 --> 00:24:24,129
Mouth moved to L.A.

548
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,497
Can't blame him, right?

549
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,066
He gave me a million chances.

550
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:28,834
Eventually, I guess I ran out.

551
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:30,502
You never run out of chances

552
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:32,537
as long as you give yourself one.

553
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,472
Wow. Nice.

554
00:24:34,555 --> 00:24:36,407
What "b" movie is that from?

555
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,876
Rehab. The remake.

556
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:40,645
Well, good for you.

557
00:24:40,728 --> 00:24:43,181
You're happy and better,
and I'm the screwed-up one!

558
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,949
Brava, bitch!

559
00:24:45,032 --> 00:24:48,686
Be as nasty as you
want. Be me. Don't care.

560
00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:51,155
I'm staying because I love you,

561
00:24:51,238 --> 00:24:53,372
and I'm not giving up on you.

562
00:24:55,175 --> 00:24:57,794
Stop being nice to me!

563
00:24:57,877 --> 00:24:59,411
Stop trying to help me!

564
00:25:01,215 --> 00:25:04,670
I said you were washed up and stupid,

565
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:08,007
and then you tried to kill yourself.

566
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,975
I'm

567
00:25:10,058 --> 00:25:11,292
I'm sorry.

568
00:25:13,228 --> 00:25:15,247
That was my own fault...

569
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:19,031
giving up because I thought
that it would be easier.

570
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:22,118
Is that what you're doing?

571
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:23,485
Giving up?

572
00:25:23,568 --> 00:25:25,854
I'm not as strong as you are, Alex.

573
00:25:25,937 --> 00:25:28,256
I'm not strong. But I'm... I'm here.

574
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:29,858
And so are you,

575
00:25:29,941 --> 00:25:32,694
and we're gonna get you
back to your old self.

576
00:25:32,777 --> 00:25:35,230
I'm not sure I can get back there.

577
00:25:35,313 --> 00:25:36,898
Yes, you can.

578
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:39,215
You just pick a place and you start.

579
00:25:51,521 --> 00:25:52,684
Whoo!

580
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:54,302
Hey, guys.

581
00:25:56,278 --> 00:25:58,730
So, you know her as Haley James Scott,

582
00:25:58,813 --> 00:26:01,831
but to me, she's the coolest mom ever.

583
00:26:01,914 --> 00:26:04,581
Please welcome my mom!

584
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:25,652
* The girl in the moon is alone *

585
00:26:25,735 --> 00:26:31,189
* with the stars and the spaceships *

586
00:26:31,272 --> 00:26:35,660
* the girl in the moon is alone *

587
00:26:35,743 --> 00:26:41,665
* and alive with the dust and the air *

588
00:26:41,748 --> 00:26:44,467
* nothing grows *

589
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:48,404
* everything is moving *

590
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:53,475
* but only goes in circles *

591
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:57,580
* and no one to talk
to is reason enough *

592
00:26:57,663 --> 00:27:01,299
* to be blue *

593
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:05,388
Thanks.

594
00:27:05,471 --> 00:27:06,823
What are you doing here?

595
00:27:06,906 --> 00:27:08,057
Rehab for my rep.

596
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,859
It's the hottest ticket in town.

597
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:11,928
Not showing up is more cause for gossip.

598
00:27:12,011 --> 00:27:13,329
Oh. Okay.

599
00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:15,665
Well, uh...

600
00:27:15,748 --> 00:27:17,600
First day back. You hanging in there?

601
00:27:17,683 --> 00:27:19,969
I'm good. I, uh, I
went to go see Millie.

602
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:22,086
You ever feel like you
just want to save somebody?

603
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:25,140
I don't know. Maybe.

604
00:27:25,223 --> 00:27:26,442
Well, you can't. I know.

605
00:27:26,525 --> 00:27:28,677
I got an "a" in rehab.
Now I just got to apply it.

606
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,013
I can Dr. Phil myself
until I'm blue in the butt,

607
00:27:31,096 --> 00:27:32,681
but I have to get back out there,

608
00:27:32,764 --> 00:27:34,516
be around everything that tempts me,

609
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:37,286
and learn to be okay
without all the things I want

610
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:39,287
but... can't have.

611
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:43,892
Learn to be okay with everybody
staring at these scars.

612
00:27:43,975 --> 00:27:46,310
Well, how about you get
used to that one tomorrow?

613
00:27:46,411 --> 00:27:47,796
Here.

614
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:49,897
Here, put it on. Let them stare at that.

615
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,098
You don't have to do this.

616
00:27:52,181 --> 00:27:53,999
No, it's research for our movie.

617
00:27:54,082 --> 00:27:57,702
Your... your character
loves to wear men's watches

618
00:27:57,785 --> 00:27:58,870
at concerts.

619
00:27:58,953 --> 00:28:00,738
No, she doesn't.

620
00:28:00,821 --> 00:28:02,840
Tonight she does.

621
00:28:02,923 --> 00:28:05,608
The girl in the moon with her dreams

622
00:28:05,691 --> 00:28:11,182
has a steel-melting smile

623
00:28:11,265 --> 00:28:15,519
but the girl with the blues in the moon

624
00:28:15,602 --> 00:28:21,790
hasn't smiled in a long while

625
00:28:21,873 --> 00:28:25,527
blue, blue, blue

626
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:26,861
can I help you?

627
00:28:26,944 --> 00:28:29,730
Or are you gonna help yourself again?

628
00:28:29,813 --> 00:28:32,433
Is the job still open?

629
00:28:32,516 --> 00:28:35,436
I don't like to be made a fool of.

630
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:37,252
I know.

631
00:28:39,122 --> 00:28:41,240
Very well.

632
00:28:41,323 --> 00:28:43,142
Then you can begin tonight.

633
00:28:43,225 --> 00:28:46,644
I don't know what "catastrophe"
did with your filing system,

634
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:47,812
but it's a mess.

635
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:50,281
Calliope is amazing.

636
00:28:50,364 --> 00:28:51,964
She's no Millicent.

637
00:28:55,435 --> 00:28:57,671
Thank you, Victoria.

638
00:28:59,207 --> 00:29:00,641
Get to work.

639
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:07,147
Blue, blue, blue

640
00:29:09,216 --> 00:29:10,935
you know, no matter how
many times I see my sister,

641
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:12,370
I am still blown away.

642
00:29:12,453 --> 00:29:14,906
Yeah, you James girls
are pretty amazing.

643
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:16,340
Look at you, Mr. Smooth.

644
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:18,809
Hey, I'm competing with
the infamous Bobby Hobbs.

645
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:20,544
Whatever happened to him, anyway?

646
00:29:20,627 --> 00:29:22,513
My infamous sister Taylor. Long story.

647
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:24,081
Definite fourth-date material.

648
00:29:24,164 --> 00:29:25,816
Hey, Quinn. Clay.

649
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:27,600
What's up, Nate?

650
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:30,386
Clay, can I talk to you for a sec?

651
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:31,920
Sure. Yeah, can you give us a minute?

652
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:32,921
No problem.

653
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,956
Is everything all right?

654
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,091
Yeah, everything's fine.

655
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,592
I just wanted to talk to my friend.

656
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:38,693
How was your trip, man?

657
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:41,129
It's good. It's good.

658
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:43,230
Good.

659
00:29:43,313 --> 00:29:45,400
All right, look, Clay...

660
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:48,336
I stayed with you because
you are a good agent

661
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,271
and you're a good friend.

662
00:29:50,354 --> 00:29:53,474
And I got the agent,
but, uh, I miss my friend.

663
00:29:53,557 --> 00:29:54,475
Okay?

664
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:55,876
Okay.

665
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:58,113
Oh, and stop being weird
around Quinn in front of me.

666
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,247
It's awkward.

667
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,797
Yeah, I'm sorry about that, man.

668
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,036
Say "cheese," aunt Quinn.

669
00:30:08,906 --> 00:30:10,057
Jame!

670
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,359
Saw you rocking out
in the crowd earlier.

671
00:30:12,442 --> 00:30:13,694
Nice!

672
00:30:13,777 --> 00:30:16,129
Yeah. I got moves.

673
00:30:16,212 --> 00:30:18,398
It runs in the family.

674
00:30:18,481 --> 00:30:21,935
Really? Mama said you can't dance.

675
00:30:22,018 --> 00:30:25,405
That's so not fair!

676
00:30:25,488 --> 00:30:27,741
So you're sad it's the last show?

677
00:30:27,824 --> 00:30:30,610
No. I mean, it was fun for the summer.

678
00:30:30,693 --> 00:30:32,812
Now that I'm home, I miss it..

679
00:30:32,895 --> 00:30:34,347
I guess.

680
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,349
My friends. My real life.

681
00:30:36,432 --> 00:30:37,851
I forgot how awesome it is.

682
00:30:37,934 --> 00:30:39,652
- It feels so good to be home!
- Yeah.

683
00:30:39,735 --> 00:30:41,554
It's good to have a home.

684
00:30:41,637 --> 00:30:43,056
Yeah. It is.

685
00:30:43,139 --> 00:30:44,940
To the stage!

686
00:30:54,483 --> 00:30:57,970
* Many times I've tried to tell you *

687
00:30:58,053 --> 00:31:00,855
* many times I've cried alone *

688
00:31:01,723 --> 00:31:04,443
* always I'm surprised how well *

689
00:31:04,526 --> 00:31:07,829
* you cut my feelings to the bone *

690
00:31:08,964 --> 00:31:12,351
* don't want to leave you really *

691
00:31:12,434 --> 00:31:15,002
* I've invested too much time *

692
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:19,524
* to give you up that easy *

693
00:31:19,607 --> 00:31:22,994
* to the doubts that
complicate your mind *

694
00:31:23,077 --> 00:31:28,933
* we belong to the light,
we belong to the thunder *

695
00:31:29,016 --> 00:31:32,203
* we belong to the sound of the words *

696
00:31:32,286 --> 00:31:36,474
* we've both fallen under *

697
00:31:36,557 --> 00:31:40,077
* whatever we deny or embrace... *

698
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,812
Julian.

699
00:31:41,895 --> 00:31:44,380
Hi. Hey, here you go.

700
00:31:44,463 --> 00:31:45,797
Alex.

701
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,770
You guys should talk. I'll... go.

702
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,292
All day long I've been
trying to figure out

703
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:58,526
how to get past the
you-and-Alex thing,

704
00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:00,460
and here you are...

705
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,661
Together.

706
00:32:01,744 --> 00:32:04,363
You are always together.

707
00:32:04,446 --> 00:32:07,265
Brooke, I bumped into her tonight.

708
00:32:07,348 --> 00:32:08,833
Of course.

709
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:12,836
It's always about Alex!
Just stop it, Brooke!

710
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:15,805
I will as soon as you stop
acting like it's in my head!

711
00:32:15,888 --> 00:32:17,774
- It's not!
- Yes, it is!

712
00:32:17,857 --> 00:32:20,910
I saw you with her in the hospital,

713
00:32:20,993 --> 00:32:23,445
sitting by her bed, holding her hand.

714
00:32:23,528 --> 00:32:25,214
That was not in my head!

715
00:32:25,297 --> 00:32:27,816
She tried to kill herself.

716
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:29,518
I'm her friend.

717
00:32:29,601 --> 00:32:32,354
It was more than that. I was there!

718
00:32:32,437 --> 00:32:33,755
How dare you?

719
00:32:33,838 --> 00:32:35,323
I am here in tree hill for you,

720
00:32:35,406 --> 00:32:36,625
and it's not good enough.

721
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:39,227
You just keep waiting for
the other shoe to drop,

722
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,796
waiting for this not to work.

723
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:43,565
I don't want to fight.
I just wanted to talk.

724
00:32:43,648 --> 00:32:45,500
Yet here we are fighting.

725
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:48,536
And I'm getting really
tired of fighting.

726
00:32:48,619 --> 00:32:50,572
You know, maybe you're right.

727
00:32:50,655 --> 00:32:53,408
Maybe I'm the guy who
needs to save people.

728
00:32:53,491 --> 00:32:55,410
That's my issue.

729
00:32:55,493 --> 00:32:58,646
But I'm also the guy who loves you.

730
00:32:58,729 --> 00:33:00,381
I'm the guy you pushed away

731
00:33:00,464 --> 00:33:02,850
when you found out
you couldn't have kids.

732
00:33:02,933 --> 00:33:04,285
I'm the guy you can't trust

733
00:33:04,368 --> 00:33:06,020
no matter how much I tell you to.

734
00:33:06,103 --> 00:33:07,455
And that's your issue, Brooke.

735
00:33:07,538 --> 00:33:09,891
I'm never gonna be able
to make that stop for you.

736
00:33:09,974 --> 00:33:12,259
So what are you saying?

737
00:33:12,342 --> 00:33:15,196
I'm saying...

738
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,431
maybe right now, you
need to work on you,

739
00:33:17,514 --> 00:33:18,932
and I need to work on me.

740
00:33:19,015 --> 00:33:21,435
You've got your new line, and...

741
00:33:21,518 --> 00:33:23,570
I'm making a movie...

742
00:33:23,653 --> 00:33:26,306
with Alex.

743
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:28,324
I should concentrate on that.

744
00:33:31,328 --> 00:33:33,547
Goodbye, Brooke.

745
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,449
* I hear your voice inside me *

746
00:33:35,532 --> 00:33:38,420
* I see your face everywhere *

747
00:33:38,503 --> 00:33:41,089
* still you say, we
belong to the light *

748
00:33:41,172 --> 00:33:45,293
* we belong to the thunder *

749
00:33:45,376 --> 00:33:48,396
* we belong to the sound of the words *

750
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:52,700
* we've both fallen under *

751
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:58,440
* whatever we deny or embrace,
for worse or for better *

752
00:33:58,523 --> 00:34:01,343
* we belong *

753
00:34:01,426 --> 00:34:02,745
Hey!

754
00:34:02,828 --> 00:34:04,046
How'd it go with Nate?

755
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:05,981
Fine.

756
00:34:06,064 --> 00:34:07,783
Told you.

757
00:34:07,866 --> 00:34:09,752
He did tell me to be good to you,

758
00:34:09,835 --> 00:34:12,454
but I think I can handle that.

759
00:34:12,537 --> 00:34:14,656
You do?

760
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:16,757
'Cause I can be a handful, you know.

761
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,407
And I can't dance.

762
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,261
And I get things wrong all the time.

763
00:34:21,344 --> 00:34:22,478
Like?

764
00:34:24,281 --> 00:34:26,366
Like kissing on the first date.

765
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:28,869
I was wrong.

766
00:34:28,952 --> 00:34:30,905
Very wrong.

767
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:33,690
Definitely wrong.

768
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:01,728
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

769
00:35:01,811 --> 00:35:03,036
High five! You were so good, mom!

770
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,071
Thanks, honey! Ooh!

771
00:35:05,154 --> 00:35:06,173
Jamie!

772
00:35:06,256 --> 00:35:07,607
Yo, you killed it, Ms. Scott!

773
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,509
Yo, thanks, Chuck!

774
00:35:09,592 --> 00:35:11,210
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

775
00:35:11,293 --> 00:35:13,246
You wanted to get your
friends backstage passes.

776
00:35:13,329 --> 00:35:14,514
Remember, Jame?

777
00:35:14,597 --> 00:35:16,849
Oh, yeah.

778
00:35:16,932 --> 00:35:18,552
Dude, thanks for the hook-up.

779
00:35:18,635 --> 00:35:21,589
You were right, Jamie.
It's mad cool back here!

780
00:35:21,672 --> 00:35:23,124
Yeah, especially over there.

781
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:25,575
Sweet! Free food!

782
00:35:27,277 --> 00:35:29,494
Sweet! Hot chicks!

783
00:35:29,577 --> 00:35:30,944
Let me show you the bus. It's out back.

784
00:35:35,047 --> 00:35:36,932
Thanks, dad. I'm glad to be home.

785
00:35:37,015 --> 00:35:38,933
All right, buddy.

786
00:35:39,016 --> 00:35:40,534
Ohh. Hey, you.

787
00:35:40,617 --> 00:35:41,802
Oh, it is good to be home!

788
00:35:41,885 --> 00:35:43,770
Oh, I can't wait to get in my own bed

789
00:35:43,853 --> 00:35:45,071
and sleep in tomorrow

790
00:35:45,154 --> 00:35:47,239
with the sweetest husband
in the whole world.

791
00:35:47,322 --> 00:35:48,306
Well, that sounds good,

792
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:49,909
but you have an encore to do first.

793
00:35:49,992 --> 00:35:51,444
You better get out there.

794
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:53,212
Okay. Okay.

795
00:35:53,295 --> 00:35:54,630
Have fun.

796
00:36:02,968 --> 00:36:06,388
Everybody else knows how this goes

797
00:36:06,471 --> 00:36:09,157
we'll be seeing you tomorrow... I hope.

798
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,140
See you tomorrow.

799
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:17,697
* Everybody's got my number now *

800
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:22,098
* maybe I could find a way out *

801
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:25,867
* I've been running
too long on this shift *

802
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,934
* and I've been keeping
on tabs on myself *

803
00:36:30,017 --> 00:36:35,404
* and now I'm cutting
in close on my limit *

804
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:36,738
Taylor.

805
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:38,588
Don't just stand there
like we're not family,

806
00:36:43,292 --> 00:36:44,977
Surprised to see me, huh?

807
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,478
Uh, yeah, Haley didn't
say you were coming.

808
00:36:47,561 --> 00:36:49,581
'Cause Hales didn't know.

809
00:36:49,664 --> 00:36:52,787
Yeah, she definitely would
have warned me about you.

810
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:55,725
Why? Still dreaming
about me, there, Nate?

811
00:36:55,808 --> 00:36:58,429
They say you never forget your first.

812
00:36:58,512 --> 00:36:59,913
Taylor...

813
00:37:01,483 --> 00:37:03,468
So, is there room in
that big superstar house

814
00:37:03,551 --> 00:37:05,370
for me and my boy?

815
00:37:05,453 --> 00:37:07,272
Unless you can think of somebody else

816
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:10,108
who wants to sneak into my room.

817
00:37:10,191 --> 00:37:11,142
No?

818
00:37:11,225 --> 00:37:12,610
Okay.

819
00:37:12,693 --> 00:37:15,345
See you there, Nate.

820
00:37:15,428 --> 00:37:18,613
* think you can find me *

821
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:23,483
* 'cause everybody else
gave up a while ago *

822
00:37:23,566 --> 00:37:28,220
* I'm looking out, I'm
looking out at gray skies *

823
00:37:28,303 --> 00:37:33,860
* I'm looking out, I'm
looking out a hole *

824
00:37:33,943 --> 00:37:36,944
* you're never gonna be... *

825
00:37:38,581 --> 00:37:40,266
See, aren't you glad we already did

826
00:37:40,349 --> 00:37:42,500
the whole firs
t-date-kiss thing?

827
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:44,803
'Cause now we don't have to be nervous.

828
00:37:44,886 --> 00:37:48,173
Yeah... I'm still kind of nervous.

829
00:37:48,256 --> 00:37:50,523
See, I have this question.

830
00:37:58,599 --> 00:37:59,783
"Will you be my girlfriend?

831
00:37:59,866 --> 00:38:02,118
Yes. No. Maybe."

832
00:38:02,201 --> 00:38:03,935
Let me think.

833
00:38:05,504 --> 00:38:07,674
Maybe.

834
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:19,572
Yes.

835
00:38:19,655 --> 00:38:22,442
I'll see you tomorrow.

836
00:38:22,525 --> 00:38:24,359
You better.

837
00:38:38,374 --> 00:38:47,901
* You're never gonna see
until you see yourself *

838
00:38:47,984 --> 00:38:51,237
thanks for walking me to the door.

839
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,173
Actually, I'm just staying down the hall

840
00:38:53,256 --> 00:38:54,908
till I find a place.

841
00:38:54,991 --> 00:38:56,542
So...

842
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,725
Good night.

843
00:39:01,931 --> 00:39:03,164
Julian...

844
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:07,318
how did we get the
funding for the movie?

845
00:39:07,401 --> 00:39:10,289
We found a small production company.

846
00:39:10,372 --> 00:39:11,957
Oh.

847
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,192
It's just kind of
funny, don't you think?

848
00:39:14,275 --> 00:39:15,975
Right when I needed a break, it came.

849
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:20,563
My father and I put up the money.

850
00:39:20,646 --> 00:39:22,131
Why would you do that?

851
00:39:22,214 --> 00:39:23,714
Because I believe in you.

852
00:39:26,486 --> 00:39:28,339
See you tomorrow.

853
00:39:28,422 --> 00:39:30,858
See you tomorrow.

854
00:39:36,565 --> 00:39:46,260
* You're never gonna be anybody else *

855
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:55,067
* you're never gonna see
until you see yourself *

856
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:58,305
* so, come on, come on *

857
00:39:58,388 --> 00:40:00,675
* see how it goes *

858
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:05,145
* come on, come on, take a deep breath *

859
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:08,097
* and don't let go *

860
00:40:18,442 --> 00:40:20,194
David.

861
00:40:20,277 --> 00:40:22,729
Quinn. Hey.

862
00:40:22,812 --> 00:40:26,533
Uh... hey, David.

863
00:40:26,616 --> 00:40:28,535
Well, come in! Please.

864
00:40:28,618 --> 00:40:30,170
Yes, of course. Come in.

865
00:40:30,253 --> 00:40:31,571
Hey. It's good to see you.

866
00:40:31,654 --> 00:40:33,039
Good to see you.

867
00:40:33,122 --> 00:40:34,940
Oh, hey, Tay.

868
00:40:35,023 --> 00:40:37,510
You remember David.
He's Quinny's ex-husband.

869
00:40:37,593 --> 00:40:39,879
Oh, "ex-husband" is so yesterday.

870
00:40:39,962 --> 00:40:42,296
I prefer to call him my new boyfriend.

871
00:40:46,701 --> 00:40:48,735
So, which room's ours?

872
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:57,342
Hey.

873
00:41:18,129 --> 00:41:19,496
Hey, Brooke.

874
00:41:23,068 --> 00:41:25,602
Still want to have that dinner?
