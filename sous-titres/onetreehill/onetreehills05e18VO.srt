4
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,150
let me take this part.

5
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,550
You're a cute kid.
Thank you.

6
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,450
You're welcome.

7
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,150
Hey, you.

8
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,950
Whatcha got there?
What's that?

9
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,250
I think you drank too much.

10
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,250
I think you're right.

11
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,250
Nathan: damn.

12
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,750
Think somebody got thrown
through a plate-glass window.

13
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,250
Dude, it seriously smells
like ass in here.

14
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,950
And rotten cheese.

15
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,450
Go away.

16
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,250
Ew, and bad breath.

17
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,050
I said, "go away."

18
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,250
Ho...
Holy crap.

19
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,250
What?

20
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,650
Have you
seen your head?

21
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,950
Not lately.

22
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,250
You have a mohawk.
I do?

23
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,450
Awesome.
Can I get one, daddy?

24
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,950
Sure, if you want to look goofy
like your uncle lucas.

25
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,150
Kind of like he has a tail...
Just on his head.

26
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,350
Jamie, why don't you go get luke
a bottle of water, huh?

27
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,750
Okay.

28
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,950
I thought
we were gonna see you
at that school-board hearing.

29
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,050
Yeah.

30
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,350
They suspended you, luke.
10 games.

31
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,050
There's only 11 left.

32
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,550
Not for you.

33
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,550
Here you go!

34
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,550
All right, jamie.
Let's get going.

35
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:53,950
Okay.

36
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,550
Bye, uncle lucas.
Cool hair.

37
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,750
Wait for me right there,
okay?

38
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,750
Look, luke...

39
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,050
I know from experience

40
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,950
whatever answers
you're looking for...

41
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,850
You're not gonna find them
like this -- trust me.

42
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,550
I know it sucks
that lindsey's dating,

43
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,450
and it sucks that you grabbed that player,
but don't make it worse.

44
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,150
The darkness doesn't
have any answers, luke.

45
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,350
Okay, you silly rabbit.

46
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,250
We're going to the beach.

47
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,250
Yes, we are.
Just me and my funny bunny.

48
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,550
Did you hear that?

49
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,950
Did you hear what I called you?
Did you hear what mama --

50
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:51,850
Hello?

51
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,150
Yes, this is she.

52
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,750
But...
There must be some mistake.

53
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,150
She has eight days left.

54
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,750
But she's recovering
from surgery, so...

55
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,650
No, I understand.

56
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,350
Okay. Bye-bye.

57
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,050
They want you to go home today.

58
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,350
But that can't happen.

59
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,350
Oh, well, well.

60
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,350
What...what is all this

61
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,150
not sure.

62
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,750
I would laugh if this whole
thing wasn't such a mess.

63
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,550
What whole mess?

64
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,450
You, your head --
All of it.

65
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,350
You and I
are going for a drive.

66
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,750
But, first, we're gonna fix
the ferret above your face.

67
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,950
why?
We're taking a drive

68
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,950
because I'm your best friend
and you need me.

69
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,250
And we are fixing your...

70
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,150
Very punk-rock haircut

71
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,750
because I have
a 5-year-old son

72
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,450
who unfortunately wants to look
just like his uncle lucas.

73
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,650
so,
How's the comeback going?

74
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:21,950
It's not a comeback.

75
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,150
Quentin says it is.

76
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,750
Quentin's wrong.

77
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:26,750
And, by the way,

78
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,950
nobody's sporting
the faux hawk anymore, dude.

79
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,150
I'm bringing it back.

80
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,250
So, what team do you think
you're gonna play for in the nba?

81
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,150
Jamie, come here.

82
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,950
I know you're
really excited about this, but...

83
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,950
I'm probably
never gonna play in the nba.

84
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,650
Sure, you will.

85
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,750
Geez, kiddo.

86
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,150
You're playing
with rolled-up socks?

87
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,350
What happened
to your ball?

88
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,050
I lost it.

89
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,250
I got to go feed chester

90
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,550
I got to ask you
something.

91
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,050
Did you tell peyton
that you hated her?

92
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,950
Maybe.
I was a little wasted.

93
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,450
Luke, you can be
such a jackass sometimes.

94
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,650
She is in love with you.

95
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,850
You probably broke her heart.

96
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,950
Oh, I didn't break her heart.
You're being dramatic.

97
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,750
 <i>i'm</i> being dramatic.
Stop here.

98
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,350
The light's green.
Just stop.

99
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:43,950
All right.

100
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,650
We're sitting at a green light.
Now what?

101
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,050
Just wait for it.

102
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,350
Haley, the light's green!
Wait for what?!

103
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,450
Kind of like peyton's heart,
don't you think?

104
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,650
I'll be right back.
You shouldn't stay here.

105
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,550
Okay.

106
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:15,950
hey.

107
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,650
You said
it made you feel better.

108
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,150
It's gonna be okay.

109
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,330
All right.
All clear, you goof.

110
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,230
No peyton?

111
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,130
No. You need to apologize
to her.

112
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,230
Hey, remember all the water-balloon battles
we used to have up here?

113
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,530
Don't change the subject.

114
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,530
Actually,
now that you mention it,

115
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,430
it was junior year,
the boy-toy auction.

116
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,230
We had that water-balloon
fight up here,

117
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,730
and you saw my tattoo
of nathan's jersey number for the first time.

118
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,130
You mean your
slutty little tramp stamp.

119
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,630
I am <i>so</i> barely your friend
right now.

120
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:10,930
Sorry.

121
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,430
The point is,
I was so scared that night.

122
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,230
I was falling in love
for the first time,

123
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,430
and I was so unsure.

124
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:20,830
But I did it.

125
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,530
And while
it hasn't been easy,

126
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,730
it has bn everything.

127
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,630
We're not kids anymore, luke.
You know...

128
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,730
It really hurts me
to wat what you're doing.

129
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,130
Lindsey said no, hales

130
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,330
I said yes.

131
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,830
Don't give me that, luke.

132
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,330
I'm being honest with you
right now,

133
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,130
and you need to be honest
with yourself.

134
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,030
What do you want?

135
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,830
If lindsey's the girl
that you're in love with, great.

136
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,930
If it's peyton, great.

137
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,930
If it's brooke, just please...

138
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,230
Stop hiding your heart.

139
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,430
I mean it.

140
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,030
Hi. How's your day?

141
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,830
Well, I cleaned the bathroom,
washed the news van,

142
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,730
returned some shoes
for the weather lady

143
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,030
because apparently the straps
cut into her "cankles,"

144
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,030
and they hired
a new sports guy -- steve.

145
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,230
How about
I buy you some lunch?

146
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,230
Come on.

147
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,130
Reverend howard carter.

148
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,930
I did a little research.

149
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,630
Man of faith, lived a good life.

150
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,930
Tough run, though.

151
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,630
Diabetes, stroke.

152
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,630
You know, it's not
exactly benevolent of you

153
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,630
to lie there and take a heart
that could be put to better use.

154
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,630
In fact,
it's really quite selfish.

155
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,930
Don't you agree?

156
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,930
"yeah, I agree.

157
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,130
Yes, I do."

158
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,030
Morning.

159
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,330
Good morning.

160
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,830
The reverend was looking
a little uncomfortable.

161
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,430
Would you like to give him
this pillow?

162
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,430
Actually...

163
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,030
I just might.

164
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,330
Hey, look.

165
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,530
It's my mom
doing the walk of shame.

166
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,430
Maybe we should hire
a nanny for <i>you.</i>

167
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,330
Out with a guy
you met on a porn site.

168
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,830
Not porn -- erotica.

169
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,830
Hey, buddy. Thought you
might want to go for a swim.

170
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,530
No, thanks.

171
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,430
It's been a while.

172
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,630
I don't think I've seen you in the pool
since your accident.

173
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,130
It's okay.
I have to feed chester.

174
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,030
Jamie, are you afraid?

175
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,130
no.
I just don't want to.

176
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,030
Are you sure?
It might be fun.

177
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,030
No, thank you.

178
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,030
Well,
I think I found the problem.

179
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,430
Brooke: you did?

180
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,830
Yes. Uh, you have
an incredibly cute baby here,

181
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,330
and you don't
want to send her home.

182
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,130
But are you sure
she's well enough?

183
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,030
Brooke, angie's tough days
are over, okay?

184
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,630
And she was very brave
about them.

185
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,530
It's time
for you to be brave.

186
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,030
But I was supposed to have
eight more days with her.

187
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,730
We were supposed to go
to the beach.

188
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,630
Well, that's
how the program works.

189
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,230
They take
the first flight available.

190
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,430
Anyway, look, um...

191
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,330
When the silence sets in...

192
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,630
And it will --

193
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,130
Be proud of this.

194
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,930
Okay? You've done
a great thing here, brooke.

195
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,930
But it's time for angie
to go home...

196
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,430
Today.

197
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,330
Yeah.

198
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,430
So you got something for me, man?

199
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,130
Just shut up
and check the ball, "q."

200
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,430
oh.

201
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,230
Crossover's
a little rusty, son.

202
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,230
Huh? Fake this guy.
Ha ha ha.

203
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,730
Where that a.c.c. Game at,
nate? Hmm?

204
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,330
First-team
all-american?

205
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,230
Nba lottery? Huh?

206
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,330
ugh,
Up out of here, man.

207
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,330
Damn it!

208
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,930
The fadeaway, nate?
Really? Are you serious?

209
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,630
The fadeaway is weak,
man! Weak!

210
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,130
Come on, man.
Let's go again.

211
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,330
No, man. I'm not feeling today.
I'm done.

212
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,530
Hey, j. Scott...

213
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,630
Why don't you run out in the hallway
and get us some waters?

214
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,030
Okay.

215
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,830
hey.

216
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,130
You see any hot
psycho nannies out there,

217
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,630
you run back in here,
okay?

218
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:16,930
Not funny.

219
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,630
What's going on, nate?

220
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:26,730
I'm just out of shape.

221
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,130
No, man. That ain't it.
That is <i>not</i> it.

222
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,830
Now, every day we do this,
and every day you play soft.

223
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,230
Well, maybe that's because
I can't do this anymore.

224
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,730
Really? Maybe you
just scared to, right? Huh?

225
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,030
Easier to have your dream
taken away than give it a shot and fail, right?

226
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:40,930
I'm not scared.
Right?

227
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,730
You not scared?
Well, you playing scared.
I'm not scared.

228
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,330
You playing scared!
I am <i>not</i> scared, man!

229
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,730
I'm -- I'm afraid to go
in the pool, daddy.

230
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,230
Yeah, but, uh...

231
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,530
You went in the pool
all the time

232
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,430
before your accident, jamie,
and you loved it.

233
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,030
You know
you can still do it.

234
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,530
I know.
I'm just...scared.

235
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,730
It's okay
if you don't play anymore.

236
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,930
Thanks, son.

237
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,130
Haley:
i'm dying here.

238
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,330
You okay?
Huh? Yeah.

239
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,530
Uh, I-I just got
a weird e-mail from mia

240
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,830
saying she met
this guy out on tour that

241
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,530
said he knew ellie. So it just caught me
off guard.

242
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,530
How come you're dying?

243
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,030
Oh, because I'm having trouble
writing lyrics

244
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,430
for this melody
that you liked.

245
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,930
Okay, what do you got
so far?

246
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,030
So far I've got nothing.

247
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,430
All right.

248
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,230
How about...

249
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,030
"i hate you, bitch.
You ruined my life"?

250
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,530
Does that
do anything for you?

251
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,030
You know what?

252
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,430
I do have some words for you,
even though they're not mine.

253
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,430
Lucas and i, we used to write
our predictions every year

254
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,430
before the school year
started.

255
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,630
Sort of what we hoped
would happen.
Lame.

256
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,130
You know
you're jealous.
Kind of.

257
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,430
Anyway, I'm gonna violate
my friendship rule here

258
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,130
because you're at,
like, code red.

259
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,430
"peyton sawyer
will become peyton scott."

260
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,730
That was, like,
eighth grade.

261
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,330
He got a little cocky
sophomore year.

262
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,630
"make out with peyton sawyer
or more."

263
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,130
And, "this year,
i'll talk to peyton sawyer."

264
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,030
"try again with brooke --
Brooke davis."

265
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:09,930
Well, that...

266
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,130
But, you know, this is
how much he doesn't hate you.

267
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,530
It's a whole lifetime's
worth.
I know. I know.

268
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,730
That's --
That's what he writes.

269
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,430
But what he says
is a totally different story.

270
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,030
Sometimes people write
the things that they can't say.

271
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,330
Come on in.
It's open.

272
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,230
hi.

273
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,430
hi.

274
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,650
This is nice, luke.

275
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,350
Lindsey,
what are you doing here?

276
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,250
Uh...

277
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,750
I needed to talk to you
about something, but...

278
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,250
You wouldn't answer
your phone.

279
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,150
You look good.

280
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,650
You look hung over.

281
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,950
Yeah, well...

282
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,650
There's a girl I almost married
started dating again.

283
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,050
And after that, well,
things just kind of went dark.

284
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,450
The book's done.

285
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,650
Oh, come on.
The -- the ending needs work.

286
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,650
I haven't even written
a dedication yet.

287
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,750
You can e-mail
the dedication.

288
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,650
The book's done, luke.

289
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,950
It's perfect.

290
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,550
So...

291
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,450
I think this is goodbye.

292
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,650
And goodbye shouldn't happen
over the phone.

293
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:02,950
Lindsey...

294
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,050
Do you ever Miss me?

295
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,650
I should go.

296
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,250
What you doing, buddy?

297
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,150
Looking at your trophies.

298
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,350
You know, someday, you're
gonna have your own trophies.

299
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,050
Think so?
Oh, yeah. I know so.

300
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,450
Trophies, awards --
Maybe even a monument.

301
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,750
And then maybe someday
you'll have a son of your own

302
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,350
that's even greater than
any award or accomplishment.

303
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:04,950
Come here.

304
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,550
Don't be afraid
to be great, son. Okay?

305
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,550
'cause you are.

306
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,050
And the world isn't strong enough
to beat james lucas scott.

307
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,650
I promise.

308
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,150
We love you.

309
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:35,150
Hi, I'm steve,
the new sports guy.

310
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,650
Hi, steve.

311
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,850
That's
the better sports guy.

312
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,550
The truth is, I'm scared, okay?

313
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,550
The countdown's on.

314
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,350
And I've got to wait for this damn beeper to go off
before I can get a heart...

315
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,950
After <i>you</i> get one.

316
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,350
You're the one
who's lived a good life.

317
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,750
I'm the one who needs time
to make amends.

318
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,650
So why don't you just take one
for the team, huh?

319
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,850
And if you do...

320
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,450
I'll use my time for redemption.

321
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,550
Okay?

322
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,250
You suck, carter.

323
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,950
I love you, little girl,

324
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,650
and I always will, okay?

325
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,650
You're gonna have
a great life.

326
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,750
Don't forget me, okay?

327
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,350
I'm james lucas scott!

328
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,650
You got my message.

329
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,350
I told you not to come.

330
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,050
I know.

331
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,950
She's gone, luke.

332
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,450
I know.

333
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:56,150
You did it, buddy.
I knew you could. Come here.

334
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,050
All right, you ready?
Yeah!

335
00:24:59,150 --> 00:24:59,950
One...

336
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,750
Both:
two, three.

337
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,950
Okay, carter...

338
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:28,850
It's up to you.

339
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:34,350
But sometimes a guy just needs a
sign there's some hope for him,

340
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,450
you know?

341
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,250
Hope.

342
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,500
???

343
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,500
And telling the new sports guy off.

344
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,200
But I should pbably
get back to being shunned.

345
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,800
I'm sorry
it's so hard for you now.

346
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,400
You know something?
I stand by what I did.

347
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,600
Luke was really hurting,

348
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,400
and it just felt insidious
somehow to broadcast that pain.

349
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,600
Mouth, how many men's basketball
championships has ucla --

350
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,700
11.

351
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,500
I don't know
what to do now.

352
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,900
Omaha.

353
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,700
Not without you.

354
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,500
Then I'll go, too.

355
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,500
Really?
U'd go with me?

356
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,700
yes.

357
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,500
I'd go anywhere with you,
marvin mcfadden.

358
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,400
Jamie, you're tracking water
all over the house!

359
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
I can't get him
out of that pool now.

360
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,000
Dude, dry off
and get your jersey on.

361
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,000
We're going
back to the gym.
We are?!

362
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,500
Yeah.
Nathan and jamie scott.

363
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,800
Oh, jamie!

364
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,900
You know what?

365
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,500
You still make
my heart race.

366
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,700
You do. I'm serious.
Feel this.

367
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,200
????and love and joy right now

368
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,300
because of you.

369
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,700
It's my other boy.

370
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,700
All right. I'll see you.
I love you.

371
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,500
hey.

372
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,500
Wow. Very peyton.

373
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,900
Lindsey
stopped by today.

374
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,400
She's here?

375
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,100
Uh, not anymore.

376
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,400
I had to go see brooke.

377
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,600
The trifecta.
How nice.

378
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,700
What did lindsey want?

379
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,900
She wanted to tell me
that my book's done.

380
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,600
Well, everything
except the dedication.

381
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,400
She said I could
e-mail that to her.

382
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,300
I'm thinking about...

383
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,600
Taking off for a little while,
you know?

384
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,700
Lucas,
please stop running.

385
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,700
Come on --
You got to let go of this dark weight you're carrying around.

386
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
This morning...

387
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,700
Nathan told me the darkness
doesn't have any answers.

388
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,900
He's right.

389
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,500
You saw him
after his accident.

390
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
And look at him now.

391
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,100
Yeah.

392
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,300
You know
that romantic notion

393
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,300
that all the garbage
and the pain

394
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,400
is actually really healing
and beautiful

395
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,700
and sort of poetic?

396
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,800
It's not.

397
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,500
It's just garbage,
and it's pain.

398
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,500
You know what's better?

399
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,000
Love.

400
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,600
The day that you start thinking
that love is overrated

401
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,700
is the day that you are wrong

402
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,300
the only thing wrong

403
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,900
with love and faith
and belief...

404
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,100
Is not having it.

405
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,800
Woman: hey, they want to do
a conference call about the lucas scott galleys.

406
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,500
Okay, just, uh,
have them call my cell.

407
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,700
And then you should
take off. Thanks.

408
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,600
Hey, lindsey,
did you tell him?

409
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,600
No. Bye.

410
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,100
???

411
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
Hi, luke.

412
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,100
Just got
your dedication...and...

413
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,200
I guess I'm one
of those lost souls because...

414
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
I lied to you.

415
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,300
I said I was seeing someone,
and I wasn't.

416
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,900
The truth is...

417
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,600
I was afraid of the immensity
of your love, and I thought...

418
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,200
Well, I just wanted you to know.

419
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,900
You asked me if I Miss you.

420
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,000
Of course I Miss you.

421
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,100
That's all I do.

422
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,850
hi.
hi

423
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,050
They're supposed to call me
as soon as angie's home safe.

424
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,550
Where's peyton?

425
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,550
I don't know.
Probably at work.

426
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,450
I didn't tell her
angie was leaving for sure.

427
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,450
And you told me not to come
to the airport. Why?

428
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:12,050
I don't like you guys
to see me like this --

429
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,550
Vulnerable.

430
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,550
That's how I always see you,
brooke.

431
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,550
And I think
it's kind of beautiful.

432
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,050
You know, um...

433
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,750
I've been thinking about
all the things you've done for...

434
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,250
Angie and rachel
and me and...

435
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,350
All kinds of people.

436
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,850
You save people,
brooke davis.

437
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:38,850
It's what you do.

438
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,750
Thanks for letting me
share that.

439
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,550
You call me
when she's home safe, okay?

440
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,850
Hey, luke.

441
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,450
We've been through a lot --
Me and you.

442
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,050
I wouldn't have made it
through today

443
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,050
or a couple other days
without you.

444
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,350
So, thanks.

445
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,850
You're welcome.

446
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,950
This is for you.

447
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,250
I love you, lucas scott.
You know that?

448
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,450
I love you, too,
brooke davis.

449
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,750
Okay, come on, guys!
Let's go! Let's go!

450
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:34,150
Come on, come on, come on!
Rick, where are your pants?!

451
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,050
Coffee accident.
Well, we can get them
at the break.

452
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,050
Jerry, we're gonna lead
with the ucla signing.

453
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:38,650
Where is it?
Right here.

454
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,050
All right.
Let's get it done.

455
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,250
You're all set.

456
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,050
I'm good.
I got the prompter.

457
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:44,850
Uh, you sure?

458
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,850
Watch and be amazed.

459
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,650
Okay, guys.
Countdown begins.

460
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:53,350
In 5, 4, 3, 2...

461
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,650
Cue music.

462
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:55,850
Go, camera one.

463
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,450
Graphic out.
And cue anchor.

464
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,350
Good evening.
I'm rick hunter.

465
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:04,050
And this is
the channel 11 evening news.

466
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:08,650
It's national letter of intent day
for big-time college basketball programs.

467
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:13,150
Aneve gold is here with news
of a local signing. Steve.

468
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,450
That's right, rick,
big news out of masonboro,

469
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,550
where local phenom shane dorset

470
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:21,350
has committed????on the west coast at ucla.

471
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,450
Could have been you.
Obviously the local poweouses are disappointed,

472
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:28,050
but dorset cited
ucla's once-proud legacy --

473
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,750
What's that?
The prompter's down.

474
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,850
Uh, go to rick.

475
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,450
I-I don't think
you want to do that.

476
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,850
Uh, have him fill.
Steve, fill.

477
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:44,350
Um, as many of you know,
ucla's mascot is a bruin,

478
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,450
um, which is
kind of a cute bear.

479
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,950
Oh, for god's sake!
Where's the prompter?!

480
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,950
It's not up yet.
Bill: should we
go to commercial?

481
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,350
All right,
say exactly what I say.

482
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,650
Dorsetited
ucla's legacy.

483
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,650
Just look at the camera and say,

484
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,350
"dorset cited
ucla's legacy."
Dorset cited ucla's legacy.

485
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:10,650
The bruins have 11 men's ncaa basketball championships...
The bruins have 11 men's ncaa basketball championships...

486
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,750
...which is more than any other school.
...which is more???

487
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:18,450
They won seven consecutive titles from 1966o 1974.
They won seven consecutive titles from 1966 to 1974...

488
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,850
A streak that was broken
by north carolina state

489
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,450
in one of the greatest
final-four ges of all time.

490
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,550
Of course,
sports fans may remember

491
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:28,550
the last big area signing
was tree hill's nathan scott,

492
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:31,750
who played locally at
tree hill high, gilmore college,

493
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:35,250
and was ultimate a first-team all-american
at the university of maryland.

494
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,550
...and ultimately
was a first-team all-american...

495
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,850
We'll be back after this.
I'm -- say your name.

496
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,950
We'll be back after this.
I'm say your name.

497
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,450
And we're out.

498
00:35:59,250 --> 00:35:59,950
Thank you.

499
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,850
And for my encore...

500
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,150
I quit.

501
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,550
And it's the same guy
that said he knew ellie.

502
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,450
Oh, mia,
if you see him tonight,

503
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,150
can you have him call me?

504
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,050
Hey, I got to go, okay?

505
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,450
bye.

506
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,550
I don't hate you.

507
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:45,250
I remember the first time
I ever saw you...

508
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,550
All skinny arms and...

509
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,950
Tanglemess of hair.

510
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,550
It was hard letting you go,
peyton.

511
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,550
You know, it...

512
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,250
It was hard losing you, peyton

513
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,050
and it was hard
seeing you again.

514
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:16,150
And it's...still...

515
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,550
Really hard.

516
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,150
I know.

517
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,550
While I'm asleep,
I have this dream where...

518
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,850
We're back
in that hotel room in l.a.,

519
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,150
and you proposed to me.

520
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,450
And every single time,
I say yes.

521
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,750
It's just a dream, right?

522
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,350
It's my dream.

523
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,950
I'm sorry. He...

524
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,550
They did all they could.

525
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,950
I'd like to send flowers.

526
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,350
Well, if you want to leave
