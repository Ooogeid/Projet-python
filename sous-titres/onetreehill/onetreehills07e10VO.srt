Previously on "one tree hill"...

2
00:00:00,708 --> 00:00:02,175
Maybe we need a vacation.

3
00:00:02,379 --> 00:00:04,221
Tree hill.
I want to go home.

4
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:05,297
Hello, nathan.

5
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,543
I think i'm pregnant. I don't know
how julian's gonna take it.

6
00:00:08,626 --> 00:00:11,399
The test came back negative.
You're not pregnant.

7
00:00:11,482 --> 00:00:14,515
What do you mean you're on your
way to alex's hotel room?

8
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:17,765
She found some cocaine and she thinks
she may relapse.

9
00:00:17,848 --> 00:00:19,051
I don't understand.

10
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:22,543
You've been lying all night.

11
00:00:22,626 --> 00:00:26,005
Blowing brooke off, messing up at work,
partying all the time, and now these pills.

12
00:00:26,088 --> 00:00:27,307
It's a lot of pressure to fit in.

13
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,378
And for once, i want to fit in.

14
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:35,272
I'm gonna ask for four years.
We'll take three.

15
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:37,882
- It's how the game's played, nate.
- You're sure they won't stop playing?

16
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:39,988
Buddy, trust me.

17
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:41,116
All right.

18
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:42,801
What are you afraid of?

19
00:00:43,078 --> 00:00:45,719
To move on. To feel something
for someone new.

20
00:00:45,802 --> 00:00:47,885
But i'm tired of being afraid. I...

21
00:00:49,506 --> 00:00:51,706
big news in the nba --
the charlotte bobcats

22
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:54,004
have opened up their checkbook
and capped themselves out,

23
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:57,071
acquiring derek mcdaniel
in a hush-hush deal late today.

24
00:00:57,154 --> 00:01:00,060
That's bad news for local star nathan
scott, who is going to have to find

25
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,326
a spot elsewhere, if at all.

29
00:01:09,672 --> 00:01:12,052
in the national league,
the dodgers beat the cardinals...

30
00:01:12,135 --> 00:01:13,555
Nathan, what's happening?

31
00:01:13,638 --> 00:01:15,824
- They signed a point guard.
- Well, what does that mean?

32
00:01:15,907 --> 00:01:18,223
It means -- it means i lost my job.

33
00:01:18,306 --> 00:01:20,231
- But...
- Look, they signed derek mcdaniel, okay?

34
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:23,359
He's an all-star, he plays my position,
and he costs a lot of money.

35
00:01:23,442 --> 00:01:25,550
- Okay.
- There's a salary cap, all right?

36
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:27,392
Each team can only spend
so much money.

37
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:29,531
That report said
the team's capped out.

38
00:01:29,777 --> 00:01:31,222
- So that means --
- they're done.

39
00:01:31,305 --> 00:01:34,504
The roster's locked. They signed a point
guard, and it's not me.

40
00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:38,112
- I have to go see clay.
- Nathan, can clay fix this?

41
00:01:38,195 --> 00:01:39,259
No.

42
00:01:39,455 --> 00:01:41,361
As of five minutes ago,

43
00:01:41,654 --> 00:01:43,365
I'm not gonna be a bobcat.

44
00:01:45,817 --> 00:01:48,784
You know, i told clay to make sure
that he closed this deal for me,

45
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:50,725
And he said he would.

46
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,354
Now i want him to look me in the eye

47
00:01:53,437 --> 00:01:55,344
And tell me why he lied to me.

48
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:02,754
You lied to me.

49
00:02:02,837 --> 00:02:05,544
Julian, wait! It was full of cocaine!
I swear!

50
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:07,670
Come on, alex. You were lonely
and you wanted me here,

51
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:10,522
So you made up some story about
a cocaine vial that you knew was empty.

52
00:02:10,605 --> 00:02:13,555
That's not true.
I wouldn't lie to you.

53
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:17,323
Oh, right, because your track record of
not lying is so impeccable.

54
00:02:17,982 --> 00:02:19,482
I don't deserve that.

55
00:02:19,565 --> 00:02:20,770
Then where is it?

56
00:02:20,853 --> 00:02:24,276
You tell me what -- what the cocaine
fairy did with your supposed vial of blow,

57
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:26,270
And i'll take it all back.

58
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:28,585
Until then, don't call me ever.

59
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,835
Who you are is who you are.

60
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:34,870
We're liars.

61
00:02:35,362 --> 00:02:36,764
We're thieves.

62
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:39,239
We're addicts.

63
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,856
We take our happiness for granted
until we hurt ourselves

64
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:51,999
or someone else.

65
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,797
Brooke, are you awake?

66
00:03:06,206 --> 00:03:08,247
Could you open the door, please?

67
00:03:11,343 --> 00:03:12,716
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:25,546
We hold grudges.

69
00:03:30,554 --> 00:03:34,007
And when faced with our mistakes,
we reinvent the past.

70
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:36,172
We reinvent ourselves.

71
00:03:36,255 --> 00:03:38,133
At least, we try.

72
00:03:41,748 --> 00:03:45,001
We're prideful and we're lustful

73
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:47,404
and we are incredibly flawed.

74
00:03:49,236 --> 00:03:50,686
And eventually...

75
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:53,286
...our flaws catch up to us.

76
00:03:57,917 --> 00:03:59,767
- Nate. What's up?
- We need to talk.

77
00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:02,882
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

78
00:04:03,454 --> 00:04:05,305
What's wrong is i don't have a job.

79
00:04:05,653 --> 00:04:07,169
It's gonna be okay.
We countered.

80
00:04:07,252 --> 00:04:09,277
- And?
- And i'm waiting to hear back.

81
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,201
Well, you can stop waiting.
The bobcats just signed derek mcdaniel.

82
00:04:12,284 --> 00:04:13,904
No, they wouldn't do that.
That would cap 'em out.

83
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,773
It did cap them out!

84
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,277
That was my team, clay!
We were building something!

85
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,541
Hold on. Wait.
Where did you hear this?

86
00:04:20,624 --> 00:04:23,410
It's on "sportscenter,"
for god's sake, clay!

87
00:04:23,624 --> 00:04:25,770
You're my agent!
What the hell have you been doing?!

88
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:28,146
Baby, where's that beer
you promised?

89
00:04:30,712 --> 00:04:32,495
No, i -- i take it back.

90
00:04:32,578 --> 00:04:35,495
- You were my agent.
- No. Nate, would you just wait?

91
00:04:35,578 --> 00:04:38,743
You knew how important it was
for my family that i play close to home.

92
00:04:38,826 --> 00:04:40,522
- I know that.
- So why didn't you close the deal?!

93
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:42,960
- Because i thought we could do better.
- Oh, that's great.

94
00:04:43,804 --> 00:04:46,923
I asked you to do two things for me --
Make sure i play for the bobcats

95
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:48,859
And stay away from quinn.

96
00:04:53,204 --> 00:04:55,646
You're fired.
Enjoy your date.

97
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:57,731
What? Nate!

98
00:04:58,136 --> 00:04:59,281
Nate!

99
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,590
Gene, you told me you weren't
pursuing any other point guards.

100
00:05:14,673 --> 00:05:16,637
You said you were
negotiating with nathan,

101
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,222
And that you were spending the
rest of your money on a center.

102
00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:25,035
Absolutely derek mcdaniel's a fantastic player,
But we were in the middle of a negotiation.

103
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:28,418
So i assume that
the 2-year offer is --

104
00:05:28,856 --> 00:05:30,993
You're capped out. Right.

105
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:34,131
Yeah.
I'm -- i'm sorry, too.

106
00:05:35,262 --> 00:05:38,143
I appreciate you taking the call
so late at night.

107
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:49,751
Negotiations are about risks.

108
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:52,141
You take calculated risks.

109
00:05:52,224 --> 00:05:54,902
- I was doing what i thought was right.
- Of course you were.

110
00:05:55,818 --> 00:05:57,344
I made a mistake.

111
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:02,066
Can i help you?

112
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,074
No.

113
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:06,425
But thank you.

114
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:12,067
I, uh, i actually should --
I should probably just call my bosses

115
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,896
And just see what i could do for nathan
somewhere else in the league.

116
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,742
So, you know, you --
you probably should get going.

117
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:21,306
Yeah.

118
00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:25,799
You know, just...

119
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,037
I dragged you along to the volunteer
thing, and i was here tonight, and --

120
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,769
It's not your fault.

121
00:06:31,227 --> 00:06:32,342
I'm so sorry.

122
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,184
Hey, it's not your fault.
Come here.

123
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,990
- If there's anything that i can do...
- There's not...

124
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:40,532
But thank you.

125
00:06:40,837 --> 00:06:42,048
I'll call you.

126
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:45,287
Look, you should call nathan
and talk to him.

127
00:06:45,926 --> 00:06:47,452
You know that he loves you.

128
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:48,998
Yeah.

129
00:07:11,686 --> 00:07:14,067
Antwon, it's 3:00 a.m.

130
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,880
I know, baby. I was checking
to see if julian called.

131
00:07:16,997 --> 00:07:19,389
He said he was gonna hook me up
with his sports-coordinating contacts.

132
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:24,129
I know that's what he said, and i'm sure he will,
but nobody's gonna call at 3:00 in the morning.

133
00:07:24,435 --> 00:07:27,985
- He could.
- He won't. Nobody's up 3:00 a.m.

134
00:07:30,671 --> 00:07:32,245
Somebody's up.

135
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,938
- Millie?
- Oh, hey.

136
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:42,626
- What's going on?
- I'm getting rid of my fat clothes.

137
00:07:42,732 --> 00:07:44,158
At 3:00 in the morning?

138
00:07:44,257 --> 00:07:45,695
I couldn't sleep.

139
00:07:46,181 --> 00:07:48,345
Okay. Uh, do you want some company?

140
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:51,299
No. It's okay. You can sleep.
I'll come to bed when i'm done.

141
00:07:51,693 --> 00:07:52,928
Millie, are you okay?

142
00:07:54,023 --> 00:07:55,442
Never been better.

143
00:08:03,162 --> 00:08:04,791
Hey.
What are you doing up?

144
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:09,082
- Worrying. What a you doing out?
- I was at clay's.

145
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:10,734
Yeah, i know.

146
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:13,267
- Do you know nathan fired him?
- Yep.

147
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,736
- Yeah. It's not right, haley.
- Don't talk to me about what's right.

148
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:18,377
- In fact, don't even talk to me at all.
- Oh, are you gonna fire me, too,

149
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,629
- because i was with clay?
- You feel bad for clay?

150
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:22,554
- Of course i do.
- You should.

151
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:26,008
You were a huge part of him getting
fired tonight. And you know it.

152
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,386
Why don't you sleep on that?

153
00:08:39,204 --> 00:08:40,761
How'd you sleep?

154
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,988
Not good.

155
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,018
Good.

156
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:48,107
I'm sorry. I thought alex was
in trouble, and i reacted.

157
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,309
She okay?

158
00:08:52,274 --> 00:08:54,773
- She's fine.
- Imagine that.

159
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:57,738
Brooke, you would have done the same
thing if she would have called you.

160
00:08:57,821 --> 00:09:00,235
Yeah, but she didn't call me.
She called her boyfriend

161
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,201
i mean, my boyfriend.

162
00:09:02,284 --> 00:09:05,549
Look, i know we were supposed to have a
night together, but we can do that tonight.

163
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:08,734
Or any night, okay?
Don't get upset.

164
00:09:09,012 --> 00:09:10,686
I'm not upset about that.

165
00:09:10,986 --> 00:09:13,216
- Yes, you are.
- Not about that

166
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:15,914
- Well, what else is there?
- I thought i was pregnant.

167
00:09:16,217 --> 00:09:17,307
What?

168
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,589
I'm not.
So you're good.

169
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:25,711
I would have been good if you were.

170
00:09:27,465 --> 00:09:28,984
If we were.

171
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,020
Don't say that to me.

172
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:40,512
You knew last night.

173
00:09:40,729 --> 00:09:42,592
I'm such an idiot.
Come here.

174
00:09:44,387 --> 00:09:46,501
I'm sorry.
I messed up.

175
00:09:48,392 --> 00:09:49,481
Are you sad?

176
00:09:51,494 --> 00:09:52,557
A little.

177
00:09:57,499 --> 00:09:58,923
It's gonna be okay.

178
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:09,572
I need more clothes.
Mine a way too big.

179
00:10:09,756 --> 00:10:12,783
Did you ever hear of this place called
a store? They actually sell clothes.

180
00:10:12,866 --> 00:10:15,330
The "sell" part's the problem.
I'm so broke right now.

181
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:17,800
Well, then you need to call
my agent, like i told you.

182
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,190
How'd you get in, anyway?

183
00:10:19,273 --> 00:10:21,941
I've had a key to your place
since, like, forever, member?

184
00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:25,981
Which explains why you've pretty much
taken everything in there.

185
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:33,125
- You're up early.
- I didn't sleep.

186
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:36,642
I mean, i couldn't sleep. I just totally sorted
through my clothes and threw out, like, 90% of it.

187
00:10:36,725 --> 00:10:38,482
Most of it was ass-ugly anyway.

188
00:10:40,214 --> 00:10:41,460
Yeah.

189
00:10:44,588 --> 00:10:46,434
Nate, it's clay. Look,

190
00:10:46,517 --> 00:10:49,026
i know you're upset, man,
and you have every right to be,

191
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,112
But will you at least
please call me back?

192
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,387
We've been friends
for a long time, and...

193
00:10:55,414 --> 00:10:57,456
I'm sorry.
Just call me back.

194
00:11:06,713 --> 00:11:09,555
????

195
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,302
Rachel?

196
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:22,313
- Oh. Hi, baby.
- Hi.

197
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:24,221
What's going on?

198
00:11:24,707 --> 00:11:28,812
Well, I came here last night just
to take a walk down bad memory lane,

199
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,724
and i had an idea.

200
00:11:31,751 --> 00:11:33,547
For sweeps.

201
00:11:33,895 --> 00:11:36,295
We do a live broadcast...

202
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,781
right from here.

203
00:11:40,596 --> 00:11:42,319
From the hallway where
I murdered my brother?

204
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:43,509
Exactly.

205
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,051
Where one of your classmates
committed suicide?

206
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:48,302
I was in the classroom that day.

207
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,516
I can lend an authenticity to it.

208
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:54,515
We can reach out to the
disenfranchised or whatever.

209
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:59,689
And you can finally come to term
with the choices you made that day.

210
00:11:59,775 --> 00:12:01,799
Oh. It'll be riveting television.

211
00:12:02,332 --> 00:12:03,768
Little insensitive, isn'it?

212
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:06,015
Not as insensitive
as murdering your brother.

213
00:12:11,974 --> 00:12:13,415
Think about it.

214
00:12:22,071 --> 00:12:24,074
- What?
- I know who took the coke.

215
00:12:24,185 --> 00:12:25,264
Alex, you...

216
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:27,261
Okay.

217
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:30,405
- Why not? Who?
- I can't tell you.

218
00:12:31,954 --> 00:12:33,089
It's perfect.

219
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:35,440
- Y-You know what? It doesn't matter.
- It does matter.

220
00:12:35,523 --> 00:12:38,244
- You said you didn't want to speak to me.
- No, Alex, it doesn't matter.

221
00:12:38,327 --> 00:12:40,947
I just got off the phone with my dad.
I was about to call you.

222
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,808
It's not happening for the script.

223
00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:47,583
- What do you mean? A-Already?
- It's good script, Alex. It's just...

224
00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:52,030
There are a few other scripts with
similar story lines already in production.

225
00:12:52,114 --> 00:12:55,249
But our-- Our script is good.
I mean, it-- It's great.

226
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,800
It's just bad timing.

227
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,025
So it's really over?

228
00:13:00,805 --> 00:13:02,313
Just like that?

229
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:04,026
Yeah.

230
00:13:04,163 --> 00:13:05,398
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:10,659
Ken, I'm sorry.

232
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,623
Yeah.

233
00:13:16,758 --> 00:13:18,800
I heard that Sacramento
was gonna sign McDaniel

234
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:20,871
I had been told *** done deal.

235
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,307
No, I- I wasn't being overly aggressive.
They offered Nathan two years.

236
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,370
I countered at four, but--

237
00:13:28,063 --> 00:13:30,533
Yeah, there was a 2-year offer
on the table, but--

238
00:13:34,537 --> 00:13:36,577
I said I'm sorry, sir.

239
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:42,669
- Don't expect me to say I'm sorry.
- You shouldn't have fired him.

240
00:13:42,752 --> 00:13:45,896
- It's business, Quinn.
- No, it's personal, and you know that it is.

241
00:13:45,979 --> 00:13:48,785
Do you like staying here?
In your big guestroom?

242
00:13:49,313 --> 00:13:51,610
'Cause i just lost my job, Quinn.

243
00:13:52,038 --> 00:13:53,763
It is business.

244
00:13:56,695 --> 00:13:58,130
Talk to him.

245
00:13:59,147 --> 00:14:00,771
It's not him.
It's his agency.

246
00:14:01,036 --> 00:14:04,297
Nathan, do what you have to do, but
please don't tell them that you fired him.

247
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,817
He's going through some stuff,
and he has always been there for you.

248
00:14:10,095 --> 00:14:11,559
Just think about it, please?

249
00:14:14,224 --> 00:14:15,934
This is Nathan.

250
00:14:16,285 --> 00:14:17,285
Yes.

251
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:27,281
Brooke?!

252
00:14:31,724 --> 00:14:32,998
What are you doing here?

253
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:34,975
You asked me to come.

254
00:14:35,196 --> 00:14:36,198
I did not.

255
00:14:36,694 --> 00:14:40,021
Well, not in so many words, but a call
after midnight

256
00:14:40,104 --> 00:14:42,462
with no message is a call for help.

257
00:14:42,545 --> 00:14:43,882
So, what's wrong?

258
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,121
It's Julian and Alex, isn't it?

259
00:14:46,204 --> 00:14:47,807
Kind of. It's...

260
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:50,428
Julian and Alex and me.

261
00:14:51,244 --> 00:14:54,816
It's the new line and my
idea for the men's line. It's...

262
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:57,103
- all of it.
- And where's Millicent?

263
00:14:57,186 --> 00:14:59,908
Or does my boss no longer help
you now that she's one of them?

264
00:14:59,991 --> 00:15:03,235
Millicent is the least
of my worries right now.

265
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:07,067
Clothes over bros.

266
00:15:10,314 --> 00:15:12,927
It's for you.
It's Millicent's agent.

267
00:15:14,094 --> 00:15:15,748
Millicent has an agent?

268
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,335
Spencer and Heidi *** Go figure.

269
00:15:21,374 --> 00:15:22,880
I wonder what she wants.

270
00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:25,830
$500,000?!

271
00:15:26,315 --> 00:15:30,151
- That's what you paid Alex.
- She's an award-Winning actress.

272
00:15:30,234 --> 00:15:33,868
Not anymore. Now she's one
of two faces of clothes over bros.

273
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:38,103
Oh, wait. You fired her.
That leaves me.

274
00:15:39,635 --> 00:15:40,649
Millie...

275
00:15:41,224 --> 00:15:43,400
You hear the words
coming out of your mouth?

276
00:15:43,945 --> 00:15:46,674
The campaign's a hit for us, Brooke.
The press loves it.

277
00:15:46,757 --> 00:15:48,590
I just want what's fair.

278
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,373
What's fair?

279
00:15:50,486 --> 00:15:51,770
What's fair?!

280
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:54,503
What's fair is that we're friends!

281
00:15:54,764 --> 00:15:57,976
What's fair is that you started
out as my assistant,

282
00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:00,142
and I trained you to run
the entire company!

283
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,712
What's fair is that when you
were miserable in New York,

284
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,506
I moved you home so you could
be with Mouth!

285
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,256
And I appreciate all of that.

286
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:12,179
But I don't see how it has anything
to do with this.

287
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:17,041
Well, it does.
Because you're being ungrateful.

288
00:16:17,675 --> 00:16:19,962
You are an ungrateful employee.

289
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:22,955
No.

290
00:16:23,124 --> 00:16:26,786
I'm an ungrateful model.
And that costs more.

291
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:39,717
Bad time?

292
00:16:40,174 --> 00:16:41,828
Hey. No. Come on in.

293
00:16:46,384 --> 00:16:48,692
You sure? 'Cause if you're writing
the next "wanted dead or alive,"

294
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,189
- I don't want to interrupt.
- Bon Jovi? Really?

295
00:16:51,272 --> 00:16:52,706
I love that song.

296
00:16:54,654 --> 00:16:55,683
So...

297
00:16:57,124 --> 00:16:59,977
How you doing? Do I need to go
platinum so we can keep the house?

298
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,174
No, not yet.

299
00:17:01,874 --> 00:17:05,190
The agency called this morning. They're
saying all the right things but...

300
00:17:08,084 --> 00:17:10,320
You think I made the right decision
by firing Clay

301
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:13,941
I don't know. It's a tough question.
On one hand, he's Clay.

302
00:17:14,024 --> 00:17:17,428
You guys have been friends for
over a year. And he's a huge reason

303
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:20,244
- why we are where we are today.
- I know.

304
00:17:21,696 --> 00:17:26,249
On the other hand you're unemployed
a bunch of million dollars poorer.

305
00:17:26,885 --> 00:17:28,607
He didn't do what you told him to,

306
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,325
and you're not gonna be able to
play close to home next season.

307
00:17:32,474 --> 00:17:35,161
And he's sneaking around with Quinn.

308
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:36,597
I know. That's a lot.

309
00:17:37,594 --> 00:17:38,803
Yeah, it is.

310
00:17:39,944 --> 00:17:42,601
You said the agency called
Did you them that you fired him?

311
00:17:42,684 --> 00:17:43,684
No.

312
00:17:44,224 --> 00:17:46,398
Quinn said he's going through
some stuff, so..

313
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:49,002
Yeah. Quinn's going through some stuff.
You know, we're,

314
00:17:49,085 --> 00:17:51,488
we're all going through some stuff.

315
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:55,922
This is your career,
and we've sacrificed a lot for it.

316
00:17:57,174 --> 00:17:59,251
I think you should
put yourself first.

317
00:18:03,144 --> 00:18:04,787
I need to make a call.

318
00:18:08,184 --> 00:18:10,851
- Man, I thought you was never gonna call.
- I said I would.

319
00:18:10,934 --> 00:18:13,591
- Why, you waiting by the phone?
- No.

320
00:18:16,124 --> 00:18:18,902
All right, so there's this
sport-coordination company called Sports-Arc.

321
00:18:18,985 --> 00:18:21,427
They do a bunch of
tv show and movies.

322
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:23,091
They want to talk to you.

323
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:25,730
That's what I'm talking about.
Baby, that's good looking out.

324
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,566
So they're out in LA. They're a great bunch of guys,
you just got to call them and introduce yourself.

325
00:18:30,445 --> 00:18:31,235
I'll huh...

326
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,688
???

327
00:18:32,771 --> 00:18:35,947
- I'll text you the number.
- Wait, so if... if they're in LA,

328
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,959
would I still be able to
work from here like you do?

329
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:42,802
Uh, eventually, but I think you'd have to move
out there for a little while, at least at first.

330
00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:43,732
???

331
00:18:43,815 --> 00:18:46,631
Okay, so... Los angeles.

332
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:48,998
???

333
00:18:49,704 --> 00:18:53,173
Look, I got to take off. I'll text you their
number. I hope it all works out, all right?

334
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,381
- All right thanks again man. I owe you one.
- Don't worry about it.

335
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,056
Alex?

336
00:19:02,644 --> 00:19:05,928
- What's up?
- Just waiting for a text.

337
00:19:06,454 --> 00:19:09,193
Okay. You sounded
weird on the phone.

338
00:19:10,663 --> 00:19:13,694
- You need to stop doing cocaine.
- What?

339
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:18,620
You're a funny bitch.

340
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:20,609
Don't call me a bitch.

341
00:19:21,063 --> 00:19:23,118
You need to stop doing cocaine.

342
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:27,662
And you know i say that
with no judgment and a lot of experience

343
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:29,727
because it's my cocaine
you've been doing.

344
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,030
- Alex...
- That you took out of my closet

345
00:19:32,113 --> 00:19:35,233
with all of my clothes  Miss "I've been
up all night and i have my own key

346
00:19:35,316 --> 00:19:36,463
to your room."

347
00:19:36,664 --> 00:19:38,135
So don't lie to me.

348
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:41,186
I'm sorry.

349
00:19:43,386 --> 00:19:45,331
Have you ever done coke before this?

350
00:19:48,263 --> 00:19:50,647
Then trust me -- it's time to stop.

351
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:53,082
I will.

352
00:19:53,545 --> 00:19:54,593
And you can?

353
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:58,002
Of course i can. I just wanted to
try it, but i don't need to do it.

354
00:19:58,383 --> 00:19:59,736
That's right.
You don't.

355
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:02,473
You can roll with me,
and we'll have a blast.

356
00:20:02,846 --> 00:20:04,783
But i can't be around cocaine,

357
00:20:05,124 --> 00:20:07,051
And i can't have friends
that are doing it.

358
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:08,672
I won't.

359
00:20:10,614 --> 00:20:12,504
Okay. I promise.
I'm done.

360
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:13,910
Okay.

361
00:20:15,145 --> 00:20:17,674
Now come here.
I need a hug.

362
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:19,069
Why?

363
00:20:22,425 --> 00:20:24,779
Because i have to stop my drug, too.

364
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:36,207
- She must be high.
- No I'm not high. I just had

365
00:20:36,296 --> 00:20:39,482
three martinis at lunch.
Okay, I'm a little buzzed.

366
00:20:39,664 --> 00:20:42,465
Not you drinky. Millicent.

367
00:20:42,614 --> 00:20:44,484
She expects me to pay her

368
00:20:44,686 --> 00:20:48,580
$500,000 to model for this company.

369
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,340
That's not high.
That's smoking crack.

370
00:20:51,423 --> 00:20:54,655
That's what i said! You know, this is
all alex's influence. That little bitch

371
00:20:54,738 --> 00:20:57,072
has been a pain in my
perfect pilates ass since

372
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,918
she rolled out of rehab
and landed here.

373
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:00,425
You leave alex to me.

374
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:03,789
But, you know,
as far as millicent --

375
00:21:03,872 --> 00:21:05,601
The campaign's working.

376
00:21:05,684 --> 00:21:08,470
That is not the point, mother.

377
00:21:09,195 --> 00:21:10,602
Actually, it is.

378
00:21:11,863 --> 00:21:13,646
I'm just saying that, you know,

379
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:15,926
we can negociate,
find a happy meeting.

380
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:16,865
Forget it.

381
00:21:16,948 --> 00:21:20,013
I'm closer to firing her
than to negociating with her.

382
00:21:20,096 --> 00:21:21,200
I understand.

383
00:21:21,753 --> 00:21:22,753
I do.

384
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,481
But you can't fire everyone.

385
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,705
- Hey.
- Hey. They're in the living room.

386
00:21:31,788 --> 00:21:33,423
- How long have they been here?
- About 20 minutes.

387
00:21:33,506 --> 00:21:35,364
- I called you as soon as I found out.
- Thanks.

388
00:21:35,447 --> 00:21:36,440
Yeah.

389
00:21:37,514 --> 00:21:40,626
I can't reiterate enough
that while this is a setback,

390
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:44,064
we feel like there's still a great deal
to make for youwith another team.

391
00:21:44,147 --> 00:21:47,194
- And what deal is that, Ken?
- I don't think this is the time

392
00:21:47,277 --> 00:21:48,601
or place, Clay.

393
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:50,505
I'll be upstairs with Jamie.

394
00:21:50,588 --> 00:21:52,896
With all due respect, I think it is.

395
00:21:53,015 --> 00:21:54,739
What deal were you
gonna get Nathan, Ken?

396
00:21:54,822 --> 00:21:56,672
- Actually, we've o...
- Shut up, Jay.

397
00:21:56,755 --> 00:21:58,543
What teams have you spoken with?

398
00:21:58,626 --> 00:22:02,132
'Cause since last night, I talked to
every GM or assistant GM in the league.

399
00:22:02,663 --> 00:22:04,334
Nate, this is what they do,
all right?

400
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:06,502
At the first sign of blood,
they insist upon seeing you,

401
00:22:06,585 --> 00:22:09,496
and they promise you a ton
of things they can't deliver.

402
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,624
Actually, I called them.

403
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:14,471
Clay,

404
00:22:14,554 --> 00:22:17,473
Nathan tells us you're not
representing him anymore.

405
00:22:17,556 --> 00:22:21,174
And we respect that, considering
what happened with the Bobcats.

406
00:22:21,364 --> 00:22:22,364
And?

407
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:26,204
And I think it's best if you resign

408
00:22:26,373 --> 00:22:27,831
and leave the agency.

409
00:22:32,534 --> 00:22:33,933
No, I can't do that.

410
00:22:34,904 --> 00:22:37,339
I made a vow to someone
that I would never quit

411
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,028
and I'm not about
to betray that now.

412
00:22:39,111 --> 00:22:42,709
Then, unfortunately, as of today,
you're no longer employed by ISC.

413
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:45,906
You're not to enter your office
here or Los Angeles.

414
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,431
Kelly will send you your
personal belongings.

415
00:22:48,531 --> 00:22:49,946
I'm sorry, Clay.

416
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:51,556
It's okay, Kelly.

417
00:22:59,476 --> 00:23:00,917
I'm sorry, too.

418
00:23:15,848 --> 00:23:17,491
This seat taken?

419
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:20,205
No, but yes.

420
00:23:21,064 --> 00:23:23,272
I appreciate what
you did for Nathan.

421
00:23:24,393 --> 00:23:27,411
I assume since you're here,
your station manager didn't.

422
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:31,656
Good luck with the job hunt.

423
00:23:34,683 --> 00:23:36,402
It doesn't matter...

424
00:23:38,143 --> 00:23:40,430
what you did and what I did.

425
00:23:40,932 --> 00:23:43,095
Nathan still lost his job.

426
00:23:43,953 --> 00:23:45,077
Since when?

427
00:23:45,836 --> 00:23:48,206
Since they signed Derek McDaniel.

428
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,035
Television's funny, isn't it?

429
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,068
It can erase all your mistakes

430
00:23:56,329 --> 00:23:57,931
or hold them against you.

431
00:23:59,258 --> 00:24:01,091
Doesn't erase anything.

432
00:24:02,323 --> 00:24:04,371
And you didn't make a mistake.

433
00:24:04,604 --> 00:24:05,759
Remember that.

434
00:24:14,927 --> 00:24:16,924
0 is so a size.

435
00:24:24,594 --> 00:24:26,194
Hey. It's Millie.

436
00:24:27,253 --> 00:24:28,871
I need a favor.

437
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:36,909
Wow, look at that. My sister,
Quinn, running away again.

438
00:24:37,064 --> 00:24:40,784
You know, before you say anything else like that,
you might want to remember that I can kick your ass.

439
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:42,016
Going home?

440
00:24:42,202 --> 00:24:43,388
I'm going to Clay's.

441
00:24:43,471 --> 00:24:45,743
- That is such a bad idea.
- Yeah?

442
00:24:45,826 --> 00:24:49,070
So was firing him. I saw the look on
Nathan's face when he saw me there.

443
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:50,972
Really?
You're gonna make this about you?

444
00:24:51,055 --> 00:24:53,372
This is about Nathan's
career and business.

445
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,507
It's business,
but it's not just business,

446
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,027
and you know that, Haley.

447
00:24:57,305 --> 00:25:00,474
He was hurting, Haley. And he
protected Nathan from it.

448
00:25:00,557 --> 00:25:02,881
He swallowed his pain, and
he put Nathan first.

449
00:25:02,964 --> 00:25:05,661
And in trying to get you more and
him more, something went wrong.

450
00:25:05,744 --> 00:25:07,822
And those things happen in business.

451
00:25:07,905 --> 00:25:12,176
"Something went wrong"? Maybe something
went wrong because Clay got careless.

452
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,483
You mean with me.

453
00:25:15,438 --> 00:25:19,215
Because Clay was being careless
and spending time with me.

454
00:25:20,461 --> 00:25:21,607
You know what? Fine.

455
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,688
You can tell yourself that.

456
00:25:24,304 --> 00:25:26,232
But the truth is,
Nathan doesn't have a deal

457
00:25:26,315 --> 00:25:28,470
because Clay didn't
think it was good enough.

458
00:25:28,553 --> 00:25:31,707
He thought that Nathan was worth more
than what they were offering him.

459
00:25:32,478 --> 00:25:34,580
How dare he, right?

460
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:37,157
I mean, where does he get off
holding Nathan in such high esteem

461
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,425
that he thought that
he deserved better?

462
00:25:40,126 --> 00:25:43,498
If that's the worst thing he ever does,
if that's what he got fired for,

463
00:25:43,581 --> 00:25:45,879
then I'm happy he's not
in Nathan's life anymore

464
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:49,186
because Clay deserves better than
that. He killed himself for Nathan.

465
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:52,202
He believed in him, and he
loved him. For what?

466
00:25:54,494 --> 00:25:56,548
Look, I love you, Hales,
but this is wrong.

467
00:25:56,631 --> 00:25:58,929
So now you can sleep on that.

468
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:19,664
Hi.

469
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,580
They're beautiful.

470
00:26:24,969 --> 00:26:26,039
So are you.

471
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:29,854
How you doing?

472
00:26:32,073 --> 00:26:33,076
Not so good.

473
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:35,267
Yeah, I know.

474
00:26:36,893 --> 00:26:38,090
I don't think you do.

475
00:26:38,983 --> 00:26:40,728
No, I suppose I don't.

476
00:26:41,814 --> 00:26:43,925
But I want you to know something...

477
00:26:44,194 --> 00:26:47,961
I know that I've talked about
slowing down and taking our time...

478
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:52,076
but I want you to know that
whenever we do get pregnant,

479
00:26:53,896 --> 00:26:56,020
that's gonna be a great day.

480
00:26:57,911 --> 00:27:00,237
And I'll be more than okay with it.

481
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:03,903
We're not gonna have that day.

482
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,820
Baby, we will.

483
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,782
No, we won't.

484
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:17,011
They didn't just tell me that...

485
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,792
that I wasn't pregnant.

486
00:27:20,314 --> 00:27:22,750
They said I'm never gonna be.

487
00:27:24,445 --> 00:27:25,524
I can't.

488
00:27:27,774 --> 00:27:30,167
You can't have children?
They told you that?

489
00:27:31,005 --> 00:27:32,136
I'm sorry.

490
00:27:32,572 --> 00:27:33,664
Brooke...

491
00:27:46,642 --> 00:27:49,230
- Hey, shh. Baby, it's okay.
- It's not.

492
00:27:50,352 --> 00:27:51,430
It is. It's going to be.

493
00:27:51,898 --> 00:27:53,192
I love you so much.

494
00:27:53,275 --> 00:27:56,773
But I want to have babies with
you. I want to have a family.

495
00:27:56,856 --> 00:27:59,993
Then we'll get a second opinion.
And a third, okay?

496
00:28:00,076 --> 00:28:02,413
We'll find the best
doctors out there.

497
00:28:02,496 --> 00:28:04,430
- What if ...
- Hey, shh, shh.

498
00:28:04,664 --> 00:28:05,684
I love you.

499
00:28:07,517 --> 00:28:09,844
That's all that matters. I love you.

500
00:28:11,842 --> 00:28:13,207
I love you, too.

501
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:31,615
Millicent?

502
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,362
Just a minute.

503
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,126
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

504
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:39,420
Makenna's over.
It's just... model stuff.

505
00:28:40,017 --> 00:28:42,992
Okay. Um...
I kind of have to use the bathroom.

506
00:28:43,075 --> 00:28:44,103
Hold on.

507
00:28:52,652 --> 00:28:54,785
- You must be makenna.
- Yep.

508
00:28:55,729 --> 00:28:56,756
Bye.

509
00:29:41,806 --> 00:29:43,857
- What's going on, Millie?
- What?

510
00:29:44,138 --> 00:29:47,923
You're up all night. You're
in the bathroom with strangers.

511
00:29:48,028 --> 00:29:50,225
- She's a friend.
- Not to me.

512
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:53,306
What's happening to you?

513
00:29:53,389 --> 00:29:54,958
I don't... I'm sorry.

514
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:58,656
I just... those diet pills. I'll cut
back or I'll just stop taking them.

515
00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:02,799
- What's this all about?
- I don't know. What is that?

516
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:06,624
- Are you doing drugs?
- Why are you saying that to me?

517
00:30:06,707 --> 00:30:08,827
Because you're in the bathroom
with some stranger,

518
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:12,705
you're pacing around like a lunatic, and
there's cocaine on your makeup mirror.

519
00:30:12,788 --> 00:30:15,729
It was makenna. She does it.
I swear it was just her.

520
00:30:15,812 --> 00:30:17,469
I wanted to tell her no,

521
00:30:17,552 --> 00:30:21,126
But I work with her, and I just...
wanted to be part of the group.

522
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,179
Are you doing cocaine, Millie?

523
00:30:26,885 --> 00:30:27,975
No.

524
00:30:28,432 --> 00:30:30,084
I told you no.

525
00:30:30,324 --> 00:30:33,698
And I am so sick and tired of you
being so threatened by all of this.

526
00:30:33,781 --> 00:30:36,569
It's like I can't do anything right
anymore, and I'm really sick of it!

527
00:30:36,652 --> 00:30:39,627
And you need to stop! Stop accusing
me of things,

528
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,165
stop judging me...

529
00:30:52,664 --> 00:30:54,691
I think this is yours.

530
00:31:13,648 --> 00:31:14,972
Sorry.

531
00:31:19,659 --> 00:31:23,163
A lifetime spent chasing a dream
and you piss it all away?

532
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:25,979
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, yeah?

533
00:31:26,155 --> 00:31:28,593
- Why don't you enlighten me?
- Why?

534
00:31:28,827 --> 00:31:30,479
What are you gonna do?

535
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:32,114
Shoot me?

536
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:41,234
Ever since Nathan was born, I had
a vision for him, a dream!

537
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,798
Let go!

538
00:31:45,652 --> 00:31:47,972
- What did you do?
- Stop!

539
00:31:55,003 --> 00:31:57,445
He fired me! I'm not his agent!

540
00:31:57,528 --> 00:32:01,003
Yeah? Well, this is your lucky
day, 'cause this is your baptism.

541
00:32:06,904 --> 00:32:08,907
You got any fight left in you, kid?

542
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:12,405
Come on! That's it. Fight back.

543
00:32:12,945 --> 00:32:14,140
Fight back! There you go!

544
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:20,562
You think getting fired is hard?
Try going to prison!

545
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:23,972
Try being given just days to live!

546
00:32:27,757 --> 00:32:29,292
You're out of your mind!

547
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:38,667
Your new life starts today, kid.

548
00:32:40,318 --> 00:32:43,048
If you're worth anything at all,
you'll find a way to make it right.

549
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:45,140
I already told you!
I'm not his agent anymore!

550
00:32:45,223 --> 00:32:46,957
And who's to blame for that?

551
00:32:47,051 --> 00:32:50,690
Your life is still your own. You
want to be an agent? Go be an agent.

552
00:32:52,242 --> 00:32:54,592
Just put on a suit, for God's sakes.

553
00:33:06,354 --> 00:33:10,437
So wait... he just attacked you
and then dragged you into the ocean?

554
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,735
He said he was baptizing me.

555
00:33:13,373 --> 00:33:16,812
That if I wanted to be an agent,
I need to wear a suit.

556
00:33:16,925 --> 00:33:17,895
What?

557
00:33:17,978 --> 00:33:20,374
- It isn't funny.
- It's a little funny.

558
00:33:20,503 --> 00:33:22,424
That a murderer tried to drown me

559
00:33:22,507 --> 00:33:24,873
and then give me fashion
advice...  that's funny to you?

560
00:33:24,956 --> 00:33:27,920
- The girl who's afraid of the ocean?
- A little.

561
00:33:29,812 --> 00:33:32,531
It's a lit...
it's a little funny, actually.

562
00:33:34,957 --> 00:33:36,562
I had all this coming.

563
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,406
I was arrogant with Nathan's deal.

564
00:33:40,628 --> 00:33:42,374
I was arrogant in general.

565
00:33:42,503 --> 00:33:44,589
You didn't deserve to be fired.

566
00:33:45,474 --> 00:33:49,552
Or to have a killer dunk your head
and criticize your wardrobe.

567
00:33:50,689 --> 00:33:51,972
Thank you.

568
00:33:52,675 --> 00:33:54,773
- I mean it.
- You're welcome.

569
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,791
I just... I feel terrible.

570
00:34:00,096 --> 00:34:04,209
- You know, I know Nathan didn't want me here and...
- I want you here.

571
00:34:06,717 --> 00:34:09,178
I left the house. I moved out.

572
00:34:10,103 --> 00:34:11,450
Stay here.

573
00:34:11,779 --> 00:34:14,427
Yeah, I... I can't. I'm sorry.

574
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:16,677
It's okay.

575
00:34:16,999 --> 00:34:20,215
You know, I do think he was
right about the suit.

576
00:34:31,365 --> 00:34:34,469
So, I've been watching this
little psychic bartender act

577
00:34:34,552 --> 00:34:37,967
you have going...  the way you predict what
people like to drink. What's the trick?

578
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:41,302
It's no trick.
I just pay attention to people.

579
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:43,814
Okay. What's my... drink?

580
00:34:43,897 --> 00:34:45,174
That's easy.

581
00:34:45,268 --> 00:34:46,739
You're a martini woman.

582
00:34:46,935 --> 00:34:48,999
Uh, you detest cheap vodka.

583
00:34:49,082 --> 00:34:51,789
And you like your martinis dirty,

584
00:34:51,888 --> 00:34:53,658
The dirtier the better.

585
00:34:54,056 --> 00:34:55,925
And you like your martinis shaken,

586
00:34:56,874 --> 00:34:59,722
A bit roughly, at that.

587
00:35:08,187 --> 00:35:11,652
I'm looking for a lover.
You just made the list.

588
00:35:16,451 --> 00:35:18,112
Hi, mrs. Davis.

589
00:35:18,226 --> 00:35:19,743
I'm sorry.
Do i know you?

590
00:35:20,096 --> 00:35:21,769
Really?
Come on.

591
00:35:22,279 --> 00:35:24,633
Oh, i remember.
You know my daughter.

592
00:35:25,078 --> 00:35:27,728
Your name is fetch or dash
or something.

593
00:35:28,103 --> 00:35:30,447
- Chase.
- Right.

594
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:33,913
But i didn't just
date your daughter. We were, uh,

595
00:35:33,996 --> 00:35:35,120
lovers.

596
00:35:36,637 --> 00:35:40,412
Yes. For about 30 seconds,
from what i've heard.

597
00:35:46,201 --> 00:35:49,305
We should shave that woman's head
and check for the mark of the beast.

598
00:35:49,388 --> 00:35:51,389
I thought she was kind of hot.

599
00:35:52,903 --> 00:35:56,080
Hi, grungy, kind of hot
bartender guy.

600
00:35:56,198 --> 00:35:58,225
Four shots of tequila,

601
00:35:58,382 --> 00:36:00,082
no salt, extra limes.

602
00:36:01,669 --> 00:36:05,693
- And can you tell how i like to --
- Mostly on top.

603
00:36:05,776 --> 00:36:08,562
Huh. Nice. You just made the list.

604
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:12,184
- Hey. You okay?
- No, i'm not.

605
00:36:12,563 --> 00:36:14,420
- Me neither.
- Let's drink.

606
00:36:14,511 --> 00:36:17,088
But your sober--
why did you do that?

607
00:36:17,703 --> 00:36:20,122
You know that text message
i was waiting for?

608
00:36:20,205 --> 00:36:21,735
I never got it.

609
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:29,337
- Stay with me tonight, okay?
- Sure.

610
00:36:43,429 --> 00:36:47,888
Not exactly what i meant when i said,
"take control of your life."

611
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:50,053
At least the suit looks nice.

612
00:36:53,323 --> 00:36:56,882
Guess some people
just don't have the fortitude.

613
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,456
My wife died.

614
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:03,477
Suddenly and unfairly.

615
00:37:05,203 --> 00:37:08,702
But she believed in me, and she believed
in what i wanted to do.

616
00:37:09,696 --> 00:37:13,031
So, i buried her,
and i picked out her headstone,

617
00:37:13,254 --> 00:37:15,150
And then i went to work.

618
00:37:16,824 --> 00:37:21,551
So don't tell me about fortitude,
and don't lecture me about dark days

619
00:37:21,775 --> 00:37:25,763
Because this
is far from my darkest day.

620
00:37:27,084 --> 00:37:28,614
You want to get a drink?

621
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,437
I might be in a dark place.

622
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,209
At least there's hope for me
with nathan.

623
00:37:42,503 --> 00:37:44,399
I wouldn't say the same for you.

624
00:37:59,649 --> 00:38:02,578
All right.
Let's go someplace fun. Come on.

625
00:38:02,826 --> 00:38:04,343
We should call a cab.

626
00:38:04,474 --> 00:38:07,332
Yeah, because that's how we roll.

627
00:38:08,313 --> 00:38:09,411
Come on.

628
00:38:17,785 --> 00:38:20,404
Yes, i'd like to report
a drunk driver.

629
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,817
Hey. Just wanted to say goodbye
to jamie.

630
00:38:57,497 --> 00:39:00,086
- You staying with clay?
- No. A hotel.

631
00:39:03,247 --> 00:39:04,541
Okay. I'll see ya.

632
00:39:05,522 --> 00:39:06,581
Quinn.

633
00:39:08,817 --> 00:39:13,293
All my life i've looked up to you,
my beautiful artist sister.

634
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:16,823
But i don't anymore.
You seem lost to me. You seem...

635
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:18,540
Selfish.

636
00:39:21,456 --> 00:39:23,836
I hope everything works out
for nathan.

637
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:44,451
Step out of the car, please.

638
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:58,228
You never called back.

639
00:40:00,621 --> 00:40:02,447
There wasn't anything else to say.

640
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,906
Except for this --

641
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:05,566
I'm sorry.

642
00:40:05,684 --> 00:40:08,237
Not for where i set the bar for you,

643
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,301
But that i didn't
get you what you wanted.

644
00:40:12,134 --> 00:40:14,802
You're the best client
i've ever had.

645
00:40:15,835 --> 00:40:17,835
I'm gonna miss representing you.

646
00:40:18,685 --> 00:40:20,417
Yeah, but more than that...

647
00:40:21,764 --> 00:40:24,766
...you were also the best friend
i've ever had.

648
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:29,550
I'm gonna miss that more.

649
00:40:34,663 --> 00:40:35,905
Good luck.

650
00:40:50,324 --> 00:40:51,605
Good luck.

651
00:40:51,788 --> 00:40:54,325
Brooke, it's millicent.

652
00:40:55,008 --> 00:40:56,093
I'm sorry.

653
00:40:56,695 --> 00:40:59,559
I got arrested,
and i need your help.

654
00:41:00,461 --> 00:41:01,978
I can't help you.

655
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:13,718
Who was that?

656
00:41:14,594 --> 00:41:15,706
Nobody.

657
00:41:23,444 --> 00:41:26,599
