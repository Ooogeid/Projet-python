356
00:21:41,453 --> 00:21:42,819
how'd that feel?

357
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:48,053
jeez. who knew
there were so many ian banks?

358
00:21:48,086 --> 00:21:50,453
maybe we should add "stalker"
to the search.

359
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:52,920
really.

360
00:21:52,953 --> 00:21:57,487
so, where's your head at
with chase these days?

361
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,686
i don't know.
i think about him a lot.

362
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:02,487
you know how it is.

363
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,886
start wondering
if he ever thinks about me,

364
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,686
and if he does,
is it the same?

365
00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:10,786
did he leave
'cause of the videotape,

366
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:13,719
or was he just looking
for an out?

367
00:22:13,753 --> 00:22:17,453
you know --
same old self-doubt.

368
00:22:17,487 --> 00:22:20,420
oh, wow.
this is him.

369
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:23,753
he's not from st. flora.
he's from texas.

370
00:22:23,786 --> 00:22:25,253
what?
oh, my god.

371
00:22:25,287 --> 00:22:28,387
his girlfriend looks
just like you, if you --

372
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,220
if i what?

373
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:36,253
if you were dead.

374
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:39,786
* a doll's house,
and i'm trapped inside *

375
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:45,353
* i'll break
these shutters open wide *

376
00:22:45,387 --> 00:22:49,886
* in my dreams,
i walk with you *

377
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,654
* in my dreams,
you call my name *

378
00:22:54,686 --> 00:22:59,453
* in my dreams,
i talk with you *

379
00:22:59,487 --> 00:23:03,520
* in my dreams,
nothing remains *

380
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:14,086
i want
to tell someone, mom.

381
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,253
abby.

382
00:23:15,287 --> 00:23:17,554
i'm tired
of lying about what i saw,

383
00:23:17,587 --> 00:23:20,654
and i'm tired of hiding out
and pretending i'm crazy.

384
00:23:20,686 --> 00:23:22,920
i want
to go back to school, mom.

385
00:23:22,953 --> 00:23:24,420
honey, you can't.

386
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:27,520
as soon as i make enough money,
wel go someplace different.

387
00:23:27,554 --> 00:23:30,020
we will, but for now,
we have to do it this way.

388
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:31,520
why?

389
00:23:31,554 --> 00:23:33,886
because i say so.
that's why.

390
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,587
so what, then?
we just hide from our lives?

391
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,719
<i>at least we have lives.</i>

392
00:23:37,753 --> 00:23:39,587
not really, mom.

393
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,220
and you might be afraid of this,
but i'm not.

394
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:43,686
abby.

395
00:23:43,719 --> 00:23:45,053
abby.

396
00:23:45,086 --> 00:23:46,487
abby!

397
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,387
aah!

398
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,287
ohh!

399
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:50,496
you need

400
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:51,430
to get out of here.

401
00:23:52,296 --> 00:23:54,064
i want to talk to you.
i said get out!

402
00:23:54,096 --> 00:23:55,930
calm down!
just shut up!

403
00:23:55,964 --> 00:23:57,229
will you shut up?!

404
00:23:57,263 --> 00:24:00,296
just --
okay, look.

405
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,763
i need you to sit down.

406
00:24:01,797 --> 00:24:03,229
just --

407
00:24:03,263 --> 00:24:05,930
just go sit down.

408
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:10,530
just sit down.

409
00:24:13,096 --> 00:24:15,597
you're abby brown.

410
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,597
look, i don't know what
you think you might have seen.

411
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,663
she didn't see anything.
shut up!

412
00:24:20,697 --> 00:24:22,396
just...

413
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:24,830
you made a mistake.

414
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,129
abby: no.

415
00:24:26,163 --> 00:24:27,563
i saw you.

416
00:24:27,597 --> 00:24:29,064
<i>i saw everything.</i>

417
00:24:29,096 --> 00:24:31,296
abby.

418
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,396
she's not well.

419
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,930
i know what you did.

420
00:24:35,129 --> 00:24:36,430
and so do you.

421
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:47,930
my brother keith
was always better than me.

422
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,830
he had a better heart.
people liked him more.

423
00:24:50,863 --> 00:24:52,663
<i>no, they loved him.</i>

424
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,863
karen loved him.

425
00:24:56,897 --> 00:24:58,563
but...

426
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,296
...karen was mine.

427
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,229
she was supposed to be mine.

428
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,330
she was just a girl
who went to school that day.

429
00:25:18,363 --> 00:25:20,129
she's just a girl.

430
00:25:20,163 --> 00:25:24,697
i hope you burn in hell.

431
00:25:27,697 --> 00:25:29,430
so do i.

432
00:26:15,763 --> 00:26:18,697
well, if it isn't tease one
and tease two.

433
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,897
did you come back
for another kiss?

434
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:25,496
brooke:
not really, derek.

435
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,964
or should
i call you "ian"?

436
00:26:27,997 --> 00:26:29,663
yeah,
we know your real name.

437
00:26:29,697 --> 00:26:32,064
actually, we know
a lot of things about you.

438
00:26:32,096 --> 00:26:34,597
we spoke to all your teachers
at the alton academy

439
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,296
and the girls
you used to date.

440
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,964
you don't know
anything about me.

441
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:39,030
really?

442
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,396
susanna gold
ring a bell?

443
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,396
you know, a lot of teenage boys
have performance anxiety.

444
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,930
i know a lot of teenage girls
who are teases, too.

445
00:26:48,296 --> 00:26:51,229
is that really
the best that you've got?

446
00:26:51,263 --> 00:26:53,630
'cause we have
a lot more than some podcasts

447
00:26:53,663 --> 00:26:56,697
and a few webcam photos,
ian banks.

448
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,563
whatever.

449
00:26:58,597 --> 00:27:00,730
boyfriend
of maggie watterson.

450
00:27:00,763 --> 00:27:04,330
<i>or should i say
former boyfriend?</i>

451
00:27:04,363 --> 00:27:06,129
you shut your mouth,
you whore.

452
00:27:06,163 --> 00:27:09,763
hey, what happened
to maggie, ian?

453
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:14,196
i don't know
what you're talking about.

454
00:27:14,229 --> 00:27:15,630
really?

455
00:27:15,663 --> 00:27:19,163
'cause the accident --
you were driving.

456
00:27:19,196 --> 00:27:20,763
it was prom night.

457
00:27:20,797 --> 00:27:23,196
no, it wasn't
my fault!

458
00:27:24,597 --> 00:27:28,030
what happened, ian?

459
00:27:29,163 --> 00:27:30,730
ian?

460
00:27:30,763 --> 00:27:35,897
we were just messing around...

461
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:39,463
driving fast.

462
00:27:39,496 --> 00:27:43,930
my father never let me
drive that car.

463
00:27:43,964 --> 00:27:45,863
he loved that car.

464
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,597
the road was slippery.

465
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,430
you lost control.

466
00:27:50,463 --> 00:27:52,163
i tried to wake her up.

467
00:27:52,196 --> 00:27:54,630
there was just...

468
00:27:54,663 --> 00:27:57,463
blood.

469
00:27:57,496 --> 00:28:00,030
there was just
so much blood.

470
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,330
her parents said
it was my fault.

471
00:28:03,363 --> 00:28:05,897
they --

472
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,964
they all said it.

473
00:28:10,196 --> 00:28:12,730
i can't be maggie, ian.

474
00:28:12,763 --> 00:28:14,964
i'm not maggie.

475
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:17,363
we were gonna be together
forever.

476
00:28:20,964 --> 00:28:24,430
she loved me.
she --

477
00:28:24,463 --> 00:28:28,797
she trusted me.

478
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,196
she forgives you.

479
00:28:33,064 --> 00:28:34,697
she forgives you.

480
00:28:42,064 --> 00:28:44,229
i forgive you, too.

481
00:28:44,263 --> 00:28:45,730
i'm sorry.

482
00:28:45,763 --> 00:28:47,930
i'm so sorry.

483
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:54,563
i'm not gonna be
seeing you anymore.

484
00:28:54,597 --> 00:28:56,964
you're not gonna
see us, either...

485
00:28:56,997 --> 00:28:58,163
ever.

486
00:29:00,229 --> 00:29:02,396
ever.

487
00:29:03,964 --> 00:29:06,463
goodbye, ian.

488
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:08,330
i hope you find peace.

489
00:29:20,129 --> 00:29:24,096
we talked
about not saying anything.

490
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:27,396
lucas --
he was supposed to do nothing.

491
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:30,263
he's really
just trying to help out.

492
00:29:30,296 --> 00:29:34,330
it's just so lucas, you know?
trying to be the hero.

493
00:29:34,363 --> 00:29:36,496
i'm not gonna feel guilty
about it.

494
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,563
nobody asked him
to do this.

495
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:42,229
that's not exactly true.

496
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:53,463
he's doing this for me
because i asked him to.

497
00:29:53,496 --> 00:29:55,530
and if you're not gonna feel
guilty about it,

498
00:29:55,563 --> 00:29:56,930
then i sure
as hell will,

499
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:59,763
because he is my best friend
and he's your brother

500
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:03,064
and he's doing this
for all of us --

501
00:30:03,096 --> 00:30:07,263
for you and me
and our son, and, um...

502
00:30:07,296 --> 00:30:09,763
it just really sucks.

503
00:30:09,797 --> 00:30:12,597
damn it.

504
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:15,396
i'm sorry, hales.

505
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,396
i'm sorry
i put us through this.

506
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:20,630
i'm sorry i made you ask lucas
to take the blame.

507
00:30:20,663 --> 00:30:23,129
i'm sorry i've bn so weak
about all this.

508
00:30:23,163 --> 00:30:24,430
nathan...

509
00:30:24,463 --> 00:30:27,797
you are about to make every
dream you've had come true.

510
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,196
everybody understands that.

511
00:30:29,229 --> 00:30:30,630
no, it's not worth it.

512
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,930
i mean, what the hell
was i thinking?

513
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:35,163
we're gonna be parents
soon.

514
00:30:35,196 --> 00:30:37,030
what would we want
our son to do?

515
00:30:37,064 --> 00:30:39,129
what would make us proud?

516
00:30:39,163 --> 00:30:41,030
and what am i gonna say
to him someday

517
00:30:41,064 --> 00:30:42,196
when he asks about this?

518
00:30:42,229 --> 00:30:43,463
that i was dan?

519
00:30:43,496 --> 00:30:46,730
that i put what i wanted
in front of everything else?

520
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:48,196
nathan...

521
00:30:48,229 --> 00:30:50,163
you're gonna lose it all --

522
00:30:50,196 --> 00:30:53,129
your scholarship,
the game that you love.

523
00:30:53,163 --> 00:30:55,863
i won't lose it all.

524
00:30:55,897 --> 00:31:00,129
i'll still have you,
and we'll still have our son...

525
00:31:00,163 --> 00:31:03,563
and we'll have that feeling
that in the face of all this,

526
00:31:03,597 --> 00:31:05,663
we didn't lose our way.

527
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,964
we still know
right from wrong.

528
00:31:10,396 --> 00:31:13,964
i'm just...
scared for you.

529
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,530
i love you for this,
but...

530
00:31:16,797 --> 00:31:19,463
but it's just not --
it's not my dream that's dying.

531
00:31:19,496 --> 00:31:20,530
<i>it's yours.</i>

532
00:31:20,563 --> 00:31:22,997
it's gonna be hard.

533
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,997
i know that, but...

534
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,196
the people i admire

535
00:31:26,229 --> 00:31:29,064
are the people
that carve a life for themselves

536
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,797
after their dream dies.

537
00:31:32,997 --> 00:31:35,597
my father
could never get past it, hales.

538
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:40,496
he could never let go of what
he wanted when he was 17...

539
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:43,030
and look what it did to him.

540
00:32:30,597 --> 00:32:32,830
open your eyes, lucas.

541
00:32:33,964 --> 00:32:35,363
open your eyes.

542
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,964
abby?

543
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:47,763
i need
to talk to you.

544
00:32:47,797 --> 00:32:52,096
i know what my mom said,
and i'm sorry she lied,

545
00:32:52,129 --> 00:32:54,430
but i need
to tell you some things.

546
00:32:54,463 --> 00:32:58,330
you were hiding
in the hallway.

547
00:32:58,363 --> 00:33:01,563
[ voice breaking ]
i got scared, and i ran,

548
00:33:01,597 --> 00:33:05,663
but i was worried about
the others and jimmy, too.

549
00:33:05,697 --> 00:33:08,196
i saw it in his eyes
when he let me go.

550
00:33:08,229 --> 00:33:10,064
he was just scared, too.

551
00:33:11,863 --> 00:33:13,697
you came back.

552
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,363
and what happened
after that? huh?

553
00:33:15,396 --> 00:33:17,030
abby? come on,
you got to tell me.

554
00:33:17,064 --> 00:33:18,496
please.

555
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:22,163
your uncle keith --
he tried to help jimmy.

556
00:33:23,697 --> 00:33:24,897
please.

557
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,930
but he couldn't.

558
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:29,229
and jimmy...

559
00:33:29,263 --> 00:33:31,129
<i>jimmy what?
jimmy what?</i>

560
00:33:31,163 --> 00:33:33,496
i'm sorry.

561
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,730
no!

562
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:39,630
was my uncle keith still alive
when jimmy shot himself?

563
00:33:46,229 --> 00:33:47,630
who shot him, abby?

564
00:33:47,663 --> 00:33:48,863
ohh.

565
00:33:48,897 --> 00:33:51,330
i thought once he realized
someone knew the truth,

566
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,296
he'd come forward,

567
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,064
so i stalked him
with messages and threats.

568
00:33:56,096 --> 00:33:57,697
i thought
he'd turn himself in.

569
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,563
i thought i'd be safe.

570
00:33:59,597 --> 00:34:00,964
but he found me.

571
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,163
who?!

572
00:34:02,196 --> 00:34:04,064
who killed --

573
00:34:04,096 --> 00:34:06,129
who killed my uncle?

574
00:34:15,229 --> 00:34:16,697
your father.

575
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:22,263
it was your father...

576
00:34:22,296 --> 00:34:23,830
dan scott.

577
00:34:23,863 --> 00:34:27,663
he killed keith.

578
00:34:27,697 --> 00:34:29,830
he was there...

579
00:34:29,863 --> 00:34:32,863
and he picked up
the gun...

580
00:34:32,897 --> 00:34:35,064
and you know i'm right,
don't you?

581
00:34:35,096 --> 00:34:37,563
you know it in your heart.

582
00:34:39,196 --> 00:34:40,897
you have to come forward.

583
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,730
you got to
tell somebody, abby.

584
00:34:42,763 --> 00:34:45,563
abby, you have to
tell somebody!

585
00:34:45,597 --> 00:34:47,396
i did.

586
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,730
i told you.

587
00:34:49,763 --> 00:34:51,530
i'm sorry.

588
00:35:10,597 --> 00:35:13,430
coach.

589
00:35:13,463 --> 00:35:17,030
i don't know how you can look
your brother in the eye, nathan.

590
00:35:17,063 --> 00:35:19,497
this is a damn disgrace.

591
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:23,230
coach, i lied to you
on the river court yesterday

592
00:35:23,263 --> 00:35:25,896
and during the playoffs.

593
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,463
it wasn't lucas.

594
00:35:27,497 --> 00:35:28,863
i know.

595
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,397
i'm sorry.

596
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,130
so am i...

597
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,996
more than you'll ever know.

598
00:35:39,063 --> 00:35:41,063
[ sighs ]

599
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:17,130
when i was 2 years old,
i made my first basket.

600
00:36:17,163 --> 00:36:22,230
when i was 6, basketball went
from being a game to a sport.

601
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:26,930
since then, i've played
7,072 official minutes --

602
00:36:26,963 --> 00:36:31,863
probably
20,000 or 30,000 unofficial.

603
00:36:31,896 --> 00:36:34,263
but for 32 minutes this season,

604
00:36:34,297 --> 00:36:37,597
over the course of two games,

605
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:41,230
i did not compete
to the best of my ability.

606
00:36:41,263 --> 00:36:42,930
i regret this.

607
00:36:42,963 --> 00:36:44,197
and i regret

608
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,796
that the fear
of losing the opportunity

609
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,530
to continue playing
the game that i've always loved

610
00:36:49,564 --> 00:36:51,430
prevented me from standing up

611
00:36:51,463 --> 00:36:54,597
and taking full responsibility
for this sooner.

612
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:59,197
i apologize to my coach
and to my teammates

613
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,297
and to all the kids
who look up to me --

614
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:04,829
especially to the kids.

615
00:37:04,863 --> 00:37:07,829
and while
i never lost a game on purpose,

616
00:37:07,863 --> 00:37:09,763
the truth is still the truth.

617
00:37:09,796 --> 00:37:12,729
and you can spin it
and shade it and bend it,

618
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:16,630
but there's still right
and wrong,

619
00:37:16,664 --> 00:37:18,664
and i was wrong.

620
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:20,863
and the truth is,
i've forsaken a game

621
00:37:20,896 --> 00:37:23,163
that's always been
incredibly good to me

622
00:37:23,197 --> 00:37:27,863
and teammates
that have been like brothers...

623
00:37:27,896 --> 00:37:30,130
and a brother
that was a teammate.

624
00:37:30,163 --> 00:37:33,063
to my coach...

625
00:37:33,096 --> 00:37:35,963
my wife...

626
00:37:35,996 --> 00:37:38,497
my father, and my family,

627
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:42,664
i apologize for the burden
i know this will bring.

628
00:37:42,696 --> 00:37:47,430
i know that the integrity of
the game cannot be compromised.

629
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:51,829
i regret that my own integrity
was not as steadfast.

630
00:37:51,863 --> 00:37:56,363
i'm deeply remorseful
for the choices i've made,

631
00:37:56,397 --> 00:38:01,530
but i will accept whatever
consequences there might be.

632
00:38:01,564 --> 00:38:04,463
i love this game.

633
00:38:04,497 --> 00:38:06,497
i'm sorry i betrayed it.

634
00:38:26,597 --> 00:38:30,796

you loved your room,
peyton.

637
00:38:36,896 --> 00:38:39,763
and, maybe, like you said,
that's been taken from you,

638
00:38:39,796 --> 00:38:42,463
but we're gonna
take it back.

639

some horrible things.

655

unforgivable things.

656
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:07,829
lucas didn't need a father.
he had one.

657
00:40:10,397 --> 00:40:14,163
he had a person who helped him
erase the shame of my cowardice.

658
00:40:16,463 --> 00:40:19,330
everything i've touched,
i've diminished --
