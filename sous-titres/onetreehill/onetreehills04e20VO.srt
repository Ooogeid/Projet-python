1
00:00:00,257 --> 00:00:01,718
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:01,818 --> 00:00:04,575
How bad will it get if they
find out about you and Daunte?

3
00:00:04,675 --> 00:00:05,948
I won't play anywhere.

4
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:08,813
Duke rescinded your
scholarship offer.

5
00:00:08,979 --> 00:00:11,535
I applied for an internship
with Sire Records.

6
00:00:11,635 --> 00:00:12,504
That's great.

7
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:14,431
It's in Los Angeles.

8
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:16,193
I was wondering,
why'd you leave Clean Teens?

9
00:00:16,293 --> 00:00:18,776
I thought if I joined Clean Teens,
girls wouldn't be interested in me,

10
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:20,920
and then maybe I wouldn't
have my heart broken again.

11
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,205
And then I came along.

12
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:23,667
What are you gonna do --
shoot me?

13
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:26,556
Yes, just like you
shot my uncle Keith.

14
00:00:27,229 --> 00:00:28,542
- Karen?
- Do not touch her!

15
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:29,862
She could be having
a miscarriage!

16
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,902
I swear to god,
I will kill you!

17
00:00:35,675 --> 00:00:38,750
Graduation Day
at Tree Hill High...

18
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:42,080
a day when we officially leave
the refuge of high school

19
00:00:42,185 --> 00:00:43,793
and begin our real lives.

20
00:00:44,368 --> 00:00:45,922
But what of those lives?

21
00:00:46,027 --> 00:00:47,740
As we go into the world,

22
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:49,621
what matters most?

23
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:52,420
Is it about the
things we create?

24
00:00:52,905 --> 00:00:55,540
The things we achieve?
The awards we win?

25
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:04,811
Is it about who we
are when we fail?

26
00:01:15,397 --> 00:01:17,150
What's more important --

27
00:01:17,265 --> 00:01:19,692
what we become or
how we become it?

28
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:22,030
- Mom, are you okay?
- She could be having a miscarriage!

29
00:01:22,105 --> 00:01:24,091
Do not touch her!
That is my mother!

30
00:01:24,196 --> 00:01:26,013
I swear to god,
I will kill you!

31
00:01:31,897 --> 00:01:33,000
Get out.

32
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:34,792
Lucas...

33
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:36,821
She could lose the baby.

34
00:01:36,928 --> 00:01:39,041
I missed on purpose.
I will not miss again.

35
00:01:41,876 --> 00:01:43,903
You're making a
terrible mistake.

36
00:01:44,056 --> 00:01:45,313
Get out.

37
00:01:56,195 --> 00:01:57,171
Mom, it's okay.

38
00:01:57,275 --> 00:01:59,002
I'm gonna get you
some help, okay?

39
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:00,473
It's gonna be okay.

40
00:02:03,765 --> 00:02:05,551
We're gonna be okay.

41
00:02:05,657 --> 00:02:06,720
I know.

42
00:02:07,348 --> 00:02:09,541
Still, it just came earlier
than I thought it would.

43
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:10,843
What? Graduation?

44
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:12,013
No.

45
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:14,452
The day I realized I was
never gonna play again.

46
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:18,323
I called every school that showed
interest in me as a player.

47
00:02:19,155 --> 00:02:20,973
Nobody wants a point-shaver.

48
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:28,990
Luke.

49
00:02:29,787 --> 00:02:31,783
- Hey.
- Hey.

50
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:35,361
How's Karen?
What are they saying?

51
00:02:35,465 --> 00:02:38,640
She's unconscious.
She has something called "eclampsia."

52
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:40,202
It gives her seizures.

53
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:41,770
What does that
mean for the baby?

54
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,251
It's pretty serious.

55
00:02:43,358 --> 00:02:46,601
They said the next few hours are
critical for the both of them.

56
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:49,391
I just want her to be okay.

57
00:02:49,497 --> 00:02:51,443
She will be. Your mom is tough.

58
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,122
Why don't I go to your house
and pack some things for her?

59
00:02:54,226 --> 00:02:54,833
Okay.

60
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:56,311
Does Peyton know you're here?

61
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,491
You mind if I call
her and let her know?

62
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:04,011
I -- I don't want you to start worrying
and putting too much stress on yourself.

63
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:05,471
Thanks. I'll be fine.

64
00:03:05,577 --> 00:03:06,640
Haley...

65
00:03:06,868 --> 00:03:09,251
you didn't happen to
mention to anyone

66
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:11,261
that I had a gun in the house,
did you?

67
00:03:11,396 --> 00:03:14,183
Yeah, I told Lucas
earlier today.

68
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:28,472
- Hey.
- Hey.

69
00:03:29,028 --> 00:03:30,111
What's wrong?

70
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:32,211
Nothing.

71
00:03:32,437 --> 00:03:33,953
Aw, come on.

72
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:36,081
We're gonna be graduating soon.

73
00:03:36,188 --> 00:03:40,362
We all know graduating plus partying
equals Brooke Davis minus her clothes.

74
00:03:41,947 --> 00:03:43,750
But we're not all graduating.

75
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:46,642
Rachel should be here.

76
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:17,771
Hi.

77
00:04:19,045 --> 00:04:20,542
How's she doing?

78
00:04:24,248 --> 00:04:25,451
Not so good.

79
00:04:27,207 --> 00:04:29,770
The doctor says what she
has could attack her kidneys

80
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:31,622
and her lungs -- everything.

81
00:04:34,756 --> 00:04:36,691
- Hi, Peyton.
- Hi.

82
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:40,301
Do you mind giving me and
Lucas a moment to talk?

83
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:42,571
Yeah, I'll go get
us some coffee.

84
00:04:42,676 --> 00:04:43,720
Thanks.

85
00:04:51,048 --> 00:04:52,841
What, are you on drugs again?

86
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:53,933
Are you?

87
00:04:54,036 --> 00:04:57,280
Because there's a bullet hole in
the wall of your house, Lucas,

88
00:04:57,868 --> 00:05:02,350
and nearby, I found a shell casing
from a 9-millimeter handgun.

89
00:05:02,888 --> 00:05:05,610
I happen to be missing
a 9-millimeter handgun,

90
00:05:05,716 --> 00:05:07,271
one you knew about.

91
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:12,200
There's a police officer
about 40 yards down the hall.

92
00:05:12,307 --> 00:05:14,411
You want to talk to him,
or you want to talk to me?

93
00:05:14,516 --> 00:05:15,791
You'll think I'm crazy.

94
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,250
I don't know if
anyone's told you,

95
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:20,951
but I'm about as crazy as you
can get without being committed.

96
00:05:22,506 --> 00:05:23,670
Try me.

97
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:32,843
Dan killed Keith.

98
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:36,553
It wasn't Jimmy Edwards.
It was Dan.

99
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:39,261
He got into the
school that day,

100
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:42,083
and he shot Keith.
And there was a witness, but...

101
00:05:42,795 --> 00:05:44,390
she's gone now.

102
00:05:46,836 --> 00:05:49,072
Dan killed Keith, Deb.

103
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:54,823
I believe you.

104
00:05:55,885 --> 00:05:57,051
You do?

105
00:05:58,126 --> 00:06:01,290
Dan thought it was Keith,
not me,

106
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:03,782
who tried to burn him
in the dealership fire.

107
00:06:04,758 --> 00:06:07,062
Oh, my god, what did I do?

108
00:06:10,107 --> 00:06:11,423
Who else knows?

109
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:14,071
- My mom, but --
- Where's the gun, Lucas?

110
00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:16,491
There's a reason you didn't shoot him,
and you know it.

111
00:06:16,596 --> 00:06:18,100
It's not the way.

112
00:06:33,737 --> 00:06:35,402
I won't leave her side.

113
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:38,000
If Dan tries anything,
I'll be right here.

114
00:06:38,508 --> 00:06:40,082
You should go see Peyton.

115
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,163
It's okay.

116
00:06:45,476 --> 00:06:46,702
Lucas...

117
00:06:48,977 --> 00:06:51,532
I'm sorry, truly.

118
00:06:52,405 --> 00:06:54,381
But justice will be served.

119
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:56,571
I promise you that.

123
00:07:58,898 --> 00:08:00,711
How's your speech
coming, Haley?

124
00:08:01,457 --> 00:08:02,632
Not great.

125
00:08:02,887 --> 00:08:05,031
I'm trying to write
about how we all should believe

126
00:08:05,138 --> 00:08:07,331
in the good things in life, but...

127
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:09,601
it's feeling a
little false today.

128
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:13,731
I think I'm gonna
take a year off.

129
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,113
I can work nights and take care of
the baby while you take classes.

130
00:08:17,885 --> 00:08:19,191
What about college?

131
00:08:19,605 --> 00:08:21,341
Without a scholarship,
we can't afford it.

132
00:08:21,448 --> 00:08:23,603
I'll just save up,
and I'll go next year.

133
00:08:23,706 --> 00:08:27,240
You'll go this year and play basketball.
We're not giving up on that yet.

134
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:29,281
Every college in America has.

135
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,522
You know,
Skills is playing college basketball.

136
00:08:31,628 --> 00:08:33,890
Maybe he can talk to
somebody for you.

137
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:35,313
Yeah.

138
00:08:35,418 --> 00:08:36,733
Yeah, maybe.

139
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,700
- Hey.
- Hey.

140
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,291
Hey, how's Karen?

141
00:08:44,397 --> 00:08:45,381
No change.

142
00:08:45,486 --> 00:08:47,292
Is there anything
that we can do?

143
00:08:47,398 --> 00:08:50,230
Yeah. It's your last day
as high-school students.

144
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,925
You can go and be kids
for the rest of the day.

145
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:54,247
No, I'm not leaving my mother.

146
00:08:54,349 --> 00:08:56,556
If anything changes,
I will call you immediately.

147
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:57,772
I promise you.

148
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:00,100
That's a good idea, Luke.

149
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:02,891
You should go home,
get some food, take a shower.

150
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:04,873
Yeah, you do kind of stink.

151
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:06,992
Come on.

152
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:11,541
You'll call me?

153
00:09:11,646 --> 00:09:13,231
- First thing.
- Okay.

154
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:14,622
Lucas.

155
00:09:16,238 --> 00:09:18,243
Stay away from Dan.

156
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:19,760
Understand me?

157
00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:21,041
Yes, ma'am.

158
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:22,253
All right.

159
00:09:29,357 --> 00:09:30,351
Brooke?

160
00:09:31,117 --> 00:09:33,130
Hey. Thanks for coming.

161
00:09:33,235 --> 00:09:34,512
Thanks for calling.

162
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:35,980
Are you okay?

163
00:09:36,627 --> 00:09:39,952
I don't know. Karen's still in
the hospital, and there's...

164
00:09:40,395 --> 00:09:41,782
something else.

165
00:09:41,886 --> 00:09:43,862
Okay... I think.

166
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:49,362
I think I'm gonna turn myself in
for stealing the calculus exam.

167
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:51,011
The day before graduation?

168
00:09:51,117 --> 00:09:52,350
I know.

169
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:54,411
It's just...

170
00:09:55,877 --> 00:09:58,813
I was looking at the honor
wall at school, and...

171
00:09:59,737 --> 00:10:02,503
I don't belong up there...
you know?

172
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:05,332
There's nothing honorable about
letting your friend take the blame

173
00:10:05,365 --> 00:10:06,742
for something you've done.

174
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:10,172
All right, I love you for that,
but what if they don't let you graduate?

175
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:13,282
I mean, Rachel's already gone,
school's over.

176
00:10:13,388 --> 00:10:15,021
What's it really gonna change?

177
00:10:15,388 --> 00:10:17,491
The way I feel about myself.

178
00:10:19,476 --> 00:10:21,581
And you just said you love me.

179
00:10:22,236 --> 00:10:23,173
I did not.

180
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:24,371
Did so.

181
00:10:24,576 --> 00:10:27,582
You just said,
"and I love you for that."

182
00:10:28,468 --> 00:10:29,741
So what if I did?

183
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:32,641
And what if I do?

184
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:37,470
Hey, babe.

185
00:10:37,716 --> 00:10:38,923
Got some good news.

186
00:10:41,938 --> 00:10:45,853
So, my parents want to have your parents
over before graduation tomorrow --

187
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,000
a little quiche,
maybe some lawn darts.

188
00:10:48,108 --> 00:10:49,470
Baby, quiche and lawn darts?

189
00:10:49,575 --> 00:10:51,060
Do your parents know
my parents are black?

190
00:10:51,095 --> 00:10:53,342
They don't know you're black,
so probably not.

191
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:58,233
Stop it. Race has never been an issue
to my parents with any of my friends.

192
00:10:58,338 --> 00:11:00,650
But was you having sex
with any of your friends?

193
00:11:00,755 --> 00:11:02,393
Do you really think it's
gonna be a problem?

194
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:04,581
Maybe not for us,
but for our parents, it usually is.

195
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:06,640
I'll just have to tell them,
and if it's a problem,

196
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:08,460
they're not the parents
I raised them to be.

197
00:11:09,406 --> 00:11:11,240
Hi, Nate. Bye, Nate.

198
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:15,131
- What's up, man?
- What's up, dog?

199
00:11:15,235 --> 00:11:16,270
You hear about Luke's mom?

200
00:11:16,296 --> 00:11:17,320
Yeah.

201
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:19,791
Figured I'd give the family some space,
you know?

202
00:11:19,898 --> 00:11:21,131
Anything I could do?

203
00:11:21,236 --> 00:11:22,381
Not for them.

204
00:11:22,488 --> 00:11:23,651
Maybe for me.

205
00:11:23,757 --> 00:11:26,003
Yeah, listen, man,
I talked to my coaches, dog,

206
00:11:26,107 --> 00:11:27,452
and I don't think
it's gonna work out.

207
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:28,961
Oh, that's all right, man.
I figured.

208
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:32,332
But Haley mentioned to me that if
you didn't get your scholarship,

209
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:35,012
there's a job waiting for you in
the factory where your dad works.

210
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:36,001
Yeah.

211
00:11:36,106 --> 00:11:38,323
I thought if you weren't taking it,
maybe I could?

212
00:11:40,246 --> 00:11:42,383
Yeah, I mean,
I could talk to pops.

213
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:43,580
Can you go by there today?

214
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:45,572
Yeah, whatever it takes.
Just give me a call.

215
00:11:45,676 --> 00:11:47,152
- Cool.
- All right.

216
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:49,103
- Thanks a lot, Skills.
- No doubt.

217
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:51,811
Hey, yo, Nate.

218
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:55,201
Sorry things ain't working
out for you on the court, man.

219
00:11:55,706 --> 00:11:57,032
Yeah, well...

220
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:58,832
It's the risk I took, right?

221
00:11:59,017 --> 00:12:01,590
Commit a crime,
sometimes it catches up to you.

222
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:11,223
Lucas?

223
00:12:15,906 --> 00:12:18,200
I understand you're really
mixed up about all this.

224
00:12:18,306 --> 00:12:20,063
You're saying you
didn't kill Keith?

225
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,012
Is that what you
want me to believe?

226
00:12:23,716 --> 00:12:26,782
Yes, Lucas. That's what I want
you to believe with all my heart.

227
00:12:30,568 --> 00:12:32,212
That's never gonna happen.

228
00:12:33,238 --> 00:12:35,760
You realize I'm in a
lose-lose situation here.

229
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:38,693
If your mother doesn't wake up,
then I'll never gonna forgive myself.

230
00:12:38,795 --> 00:12:41,950
If she does wake up,
then she'll never forgive me.

231
00:12:42,605 --> 00:12:43,863
Unless...

232
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:46,633
unless, maybe...

233
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,283
somehow, you're mistaken.

234
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:52,222
No chance.

235
00:12:54,368 --> 00:12:55,860
I know what you did.

236
00:12:57,308 --> 00:12:59,033
And you know what you did.

237
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:03,052
And maybe you'll never pay for it,
but I promise you...

238
00:13:03,677 --> 00:13:05,721
my mom's gonna know it, too.

239
00:13:07,876 --> 00:13:09,330
And what about her child?

240
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:11,450
Keith's child --

241
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,800
another kid raised without a father,
like you?

242
00:13:13,905 --> 00:13:15,323
I had Keith...

243
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:18,570
until you took him from us.

244
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:22,533
And I'll be there
for his child,

245
00:13:22,637 --> 00:13:24,111
but you won't be.

246
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:25,592
Ever.

247
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:28,193
I'll make sure of that.

248
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:47,272
You know, a lot of people go
to therapy to deal with stuff,

249
00:13:47,377 --> 00:13:50,043
but I say a good root-beer float
can fix just about anybody.

250
00:13:50,148 --> 00:13:51,452
Fixes me up.

251
00:13:52,108 --> 00:13:53,763
Your parents coming
back for graduation?

252
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:56,593
No, they would rather come
back when the baby's born,

253
00:13:56,695 --> 00:13:57,981
so I'll see them soon.

254
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,290
How about your dad?

255
00:14:00,098 --> 00:14:02,913
Actually, I think I'm gonna take
that internship in California,

256
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:04,950
so he's just gonna meet me there in,
like, two weeks.

257
00:14:04,987 --> 00:14:07,370
Peyton, that's awesome!
I'm so glad you decided to do that.

258
00:14:07,477 --> 00:14:09,351
You're gonna do great.
That's cool.

259
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,472
Did Lucas say he's coming back here
before he goes to the hospital?

260
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:15,640
Well, I'll get out of your hair,
as much as I hate to...

261
00:14:15,745 --> 00:14:17,052
slurp and run.

262
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,360
So good.

263
00:14:18,668 --> 00:14:19,701
Come in.

264
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:23,090
I was just getting ready to go.

265
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,162
Oh, good. Hey, I got good news.

266
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:26,100
Skills hooked me up.

267
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,132
- With his team?!
- No, with his dad.

268
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,542
He got me that job at
his father's factory.

269
00:14:32,678 --> 00:14:34,670
- Well, Nathan, that's...
- It's good money, Hales,

270
00:14:34,776 --> 00:14:36,403
but it does start today, so...

271
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:38,701
So much for the last
day of being a kid, huh?

272
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:56,553
Miss Davis.

273
00:14:57,508 --> 00:14:59,701
A bit early for graduation,
aren't you?

274
00:15:00,897 --> 00:15:03,322
I'm the one who stole
the calculus exam.

275
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:12,681
I'm really glad you came back.
I missed you.

276
00:15:15,226 --> 00:15:17,673
You think we could just stay
here for the rest of the summer?

277
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:21,410
Mmm, yeah, there was a chance of
that till I took that internship.

278
00:15:23,177 --> 00:15:24,873
It's okay. I'm glad you did.

279
00:15:24,978 --> 00:15:26,973
Yeah, it's gonna
be a long summer.

280
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:29,461
Nah, it'll fly by.

281
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,002
You know, I --

282
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:36,040
I really do appreciate you
being supportive about all this,

283
00:15:36,146 --> 00:15:39,342
but a little bit of disappointment
would be good for my ego.

284
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,431
I just want you to
be happy, Peyton.

285
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,802
You have so much
magic in you...

286
00:15:48,087 --> 00:15:49,760
But everything's okay?

287
00:15:54,675 --> 00:15:58,213
I wish we never left that hotel room
in Honey Grove, 'cause you're perfect,

288
00:15:58,316 --> 00:15:59,401
and we're perfect,

289
00:15:59,507 --> 00:16:02,193
and that night was... perfect.

290
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:05,481
Well, saying that just
earned you another one.

291
00:16:11,248 --> 00:16:13,232
I think I got to get
back to the hospital.

292
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:14,892
Can I come with you?

293
00:16:15,815 --> 00:16:16,733
Sure.

294
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:19,410
Just --

295
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:23,330
...let me hold you for
a couple more minutes.

296
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:26,023
That's what's gonna fix me.

297
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:54,310
Mr. Scott.

298
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:55,641
Mr. Taylor.

299
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:58,033
Charles. You ready
to go to work?

300
00:16:58,135 --> 00:16:59,713
- Yes, sir.
- Right answer.

301
00:16:59,906 --> 00:17:00,920
Follow me.

302
00:17:02,378 --> 00:17:04,351
You know anything
about what we do here?

303
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,881
Uh, not really.
Is it shipping of some sort?

304
00:17:06,988 --> 00:17:09,650
Of some sort.
We manufacture the steel

305
00:17:09,757 --> 00:17:12,621
that goes to building those freighters
you see coming in and out of the cape.

306
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,752
At least, that's what the company does.
We mostly just work.

307
00:17:15,858 --> 00:17:18,293
But if hard work doesn't scare you,
you'll do fine.

308
00:17:18,395 --> 00:17:20,100
Hard work doesn't
scare me, sir.

309
00:17:21,768 --> 00:17:23,063
Another right answer.

310
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:27,352
Let's, uh, lose that "sir."
It's "Charles" or "Chuck."

311
00:17:27,868 --> 00:17:30,230
Your name is Chuck Taylor?
Like the shoe?

312
00:17:30,338 --> 00:17:33,060
More like the guy who's gonna
work your sorry ass to the bone.

313
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:35,500
Grab the other side of that pipe,
Nathan Scott.

314
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:37,723
Yes, sir, Chuck --

315
00:17:37,826 --> 00:17:39,830
Charles -- sorry.

316
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:52,242
And that's the truth about
how I passed calculus,

317
00:17:52,346 --> 00:17:57,233
so I'm guessing there's all sorts
of mean stuff you have to do now.

318
00:17:58,157 --> 00:18:00,041
- Well, I --
- Just, before you do,

319
00:18:00,148 --> 00:18:01,610
can I say something?

320
00:18:02,795 --> 00:18:06,413
You know, when I was a freshman,
I wasn't a very good person.

321
00:18:06,747 --> 00:18:10,893
I mean, sure, I was popular and
dating seniors, but as a person,

322
00:18:10,998 --> 00:18:12,772
I was pretty lost.

323
00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:16,712
And over the last four years,
I've been forced to grow up.

324
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:19,622
I stopped letting
boys define me,

325
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:22,752
and I started believing in
myself and in my potential,

326
00:18:22,858 --> 00:18:25,170
and I ran for
student-council president,

327
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:27,091
and I designed a clothing line,

328
00:18:27,195 --> 00:18:31,133
and somewhere along the way,
the lost, little party girl

329
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,693
became the girl on
the wall of honor.

330
00:18:34,457 --> 00:18:35,593
And...

331
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,742
I know what I did was wrong,
Mr. Turner. I know.

332
00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:42,370
But the girl I was when
I came to this school...

333
00:18:43,286 --> 00:18:45,301
I'm not so sure she would have.

334
00:18:45,406 --> 00:18:48,042
And isn't that the
point of high school?

335
00:18:48,145 --> 00:18:51,412
Isn't that what you guys have been trying
to teach us for the last four years?

336
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:55,213
Actually, we've been trying to
teach you not to cheat in calculus,

337
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:58,550
but the rest of it is
certainly important, too.

338
00:18:58,758 --> 00:19:01,001
I imagine you've been feeling
a good amount of guilt

339
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:03,493
over letting your friend
Rachel take the fall.

340
00:19:03,598 --> 00:19:04,653
Yes, sir --

341
00:19:04,756 --> 00:19:07,861
I mean, even though she told me to
and she's done all sorts of things

342
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:10,372
over the last year that would
have gotten her expelled anyway.

343
00:19:10,406 --> 00:19:15,320
Yes, I have, so that's why I
felt that I should come forward.

344
00:19:15,637 --> 00:19:18,431
You know, Brooke,
I must seem ancient to you.

345
00:19:18,538 --> 00:19:20,672
Your teachers probably
seem irrelevant.

346
00:19:20,776 --> 00:19:22,760
But one day, you'll look back,

347
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:25,101
and things won't seem so...

348
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:27,361
"us against them."

349
00:19:28,426 --> 00:19:30,713
I assume you're
going to college?

350
00:19:30,848 --> 00:19:34,323
Yes, sir. I -- I hope so now.

351
00:19:34,428 --> 00:19:36,190
- To study...?
- Fashion.

352
00:19:36,296 --> 00:19:38,022
Not engineering?

353
00:19:38,146 --> 00:19:41,181
Or anything requiring
intensive calculus?

354
00:19:41,468 --> 00:19:42,850
No, sir.

355
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,143
Good.

356
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:47,062
Go graduate.

357
00:19:47,537 --> 00:19:48,812
Really?

358
00:19:49,406 --> 00:19:51,042
Are you serious?

359
00:19:51,276 --> 00:19:53,032
Thank you. I-I don't even --

360
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:55,093
Principal Turner!
Principal Turner!

361
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:58,131
Look, if you suspend her, I think
you're really making a big mistake.

362
00:19:58,235 --> 00:20:01,260
- I don't mean to barge in like this --
- Shut up.

363
00:20:01,637 --> 00:20:04,683
Chase, I love you for this,
really, but, shut up.

364
00:20:04,785 --> 00:20:07,761
Um, I'm sorry. We'll --
we'll just go.

365
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:09,041
Go.

366
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,321
Thanks.

367
00:20:14,698 --> 00:20:15,800
Deb?

368
00:20:16,087 --> 00:20:18,120
Dr. Hudson, what's happening?

369
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:20,803
Your mom's condition's
worsened, Lucas.

370
00:20:20,908 --> 00:20:23,960
And we can't be aggressive with the
antibiotics because of her pregnancy.

371
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:25,353
So how do you help her?

372
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:28,761
I want to prep her for surgery
and deliver the baby by caesarean.

373
00:20:30,815 --> 00:20:32,853
And then everything
will be okay, right?

374
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:34,520
With my mom and the baby?

375
00:20:35,265 --> 00:20:37,731
We have to take one
life at a time, Luke.

376
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,662
Right now,
both lives are in danger,

377
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:42,192
but if we act now,
we can save the baby,

378
00:20:42,296 --> 00:20:44,863
and we'll have a much better
chance at helping your mom.

379
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:49,170
I want to be there with her
when you deliver the baby.

380
00:20:49,276 --> 00:20:50,483
Of course.

381
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:54,420
Mom...

382
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:56,730
we're gonna try to
help you, okay?

383
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:59,821
Just... come back to us.

384
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:11,833
Hey, coach.
Um, are you looking for Nathan?

385
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,950
No, actually,
I was looking for you.

386
00:21:14,057 --> 00:21:15,632
Care to take a little walk?

387
00:21:15,737 --> 00:21:18,041
Uh... yeah, sure.

388
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:23,713
How's Nathan holding up?

389
00:21:24,996 --> 00:21:26,542
Better than I am.

390
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:30,080
Skills helped him get
a job at a steel plant.

391
00:21:31,126 --> 00:21:33,760
I don't know. I just --
I feel like it's way too early for him

392
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:37,403
to let his fire burn out and just
give up what he wants, you know?

393
00:21:37,436 --> 00:21:39,062
How about what you want?

394
00:21:40,408 --> 00:21:43,230
Look, Haley,
you asked me to help Nathan.

395
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,871
I'm not sure I can,
but if I do...

396
00:21:46,425 --> 00:21:49,671
it's gonna take you away from
all the things you want to do.

397
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,850
I remember he said
something about Stanford.

398
00:21:52,957 --> 00:21:55,721
Coach, I would go
anywhere with Nathan.

399
00:21:55,827 --> 00:21:57,860
I would go to whatever
school will take him.

400
00:21:57,966 --> 00:22:00,952
As long as our family's together and
he's doing something that he loves,

401
00:22:01,105 --> 00:22:02,101
I'll be happy.

402
00:22:02,205 --> 00:22:03,732
You'd make that sacrifice?

403
00:22:03,835 --> 00:22:06,050
Yeah, wouldn't you have
done the same for Camilla?

404
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,630
Well, sure I would have,
but I never had to.

405
00:22:08,736 --> 00:22:11,323
She always did the
sacrificing for me.

406
00:22:23,436 --> 00:22:25,001
Okay.

407
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:26,501
Let's take a break.

408
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:32,733
State championship wasn't that long ago.
You can't be out of shape.

409
00:22:32,837 --> 00:22:36,542
I'm in game shape, just not "steel
beams for the rest of my life" shape.

410
00:22:37,428 --> 00:22:38,560
You do this every day?

411
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:40,283
No, I've been in
management for years.

412
00:22:40,385 --> 00:22:42,290
I just wanted to see
what you were made of.

413
00:22:46,646 --> 00:22:49,232
And, by the way, this doesn't have
to be for the rest of your life.

414
00:22:49,265 --> 00:22:52,402
A lot of successful people never
got scholarships to college.

415
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:54,373
Any of them point-shavers?

416
00:22:54,727 --> 00:22:56,540
Yeah, how'd all that
go down, anyway?

417
00:22:56,647 --> 00:22:58,223
I was in over my head.

418
00:22:58,326 --> 00:23:00,012
I just needed money, and...

419
00:23:00,135 --> 00:23:03,222
the rest was a perfectly
orchestrated series of screw-ups.

420
00:23:04,145 --> 00:23:06,503
You, uh... you regret it?

421
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:07,950
Every day.

422
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:10,482
'Cause you got caught.

423
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:15,222
Look, Mr. Taylor,
you seem like a good man.

424
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:17,670
But the thing is,
I made a mistake,

425
00:23:17,777 --> 00:23:19,482
and now I'm paying for it.

426
00:23:19,588 --> 00:23:23,123
Those 32 minutes should not define
me for the rest of my life.

427
00:23:25,495 --> 00:23:27,281
I was hoping you'd say that.

428
00:23:27,817 --> 00:23:29,870
Now all you got to
do is believe it.

429
00:23:29,998 --> 00:23:31,750
Let's get back to
work, All-Star.

430
00:23:31,856 --> 00:23:33,402
All right, let's do it, Chuck.

431
00:23:33,886 --> 00:23:35,881
Oh, by the way,
I'm supposed to be meeting

432
00:23:35,987 --> 00:23:39,181
my son's girlfriend and her family
tomorrow. Anything I should know?

433
00:23:39,288 --> 00:23:41,160
Your parents don't
know Bevin's white?

434
00:23:41,266 --> 00:23:42,493
Never came up.

435
00:23:42,596 --> 00:23:44,770
And her parents don't
know you're black?

436
00:23:44,996 --> 00:23:46,943
Look, they serving quiche, dog.

437
00:23:48,105 --> 00:23:51,490
Can I go to this thing? 'Cause it sounds
like it's gonna be an awesome disaster.

438
00:23:51,595 --> 00:23:52,961
Great, laugh it up.

439
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:54,451
I'm just playing around.

440
00:23:54,555 --> 00:23:56,162
It's probably not
even a big deal.

441
00:23:56,266 --> 00:23:58,942
I mean, if I were her parents,
I'd be more worried about you being you

442
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,553
than you being black.

443
00:24:05,116 --> 00:24:06,933
Oh, priceless.

444
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,361
"Mr. Turner, if you suspend her,
you're making a huge mistake!"

445
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:12,011
I was trying to help.

446
00:24:12,426 --> 00:24:13,462
I know.

447
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:15,172
You were very cute.

448
00:24:15,636 --> 00:24:18,321
I couldn't just stand by
and let you not graduate.

449
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:21,640
Besides, it got you
to say you love me.

450
00:24:21,746 --> 00:24:23,613
- I did not.
- Yeah, you did.

451
00:24:23,716 --> 00:24:26,331
You told me to shut up,
and then you said,

452
00:24:26,438 --> 00:24:29,031
"I love you for this, but go."

453
00:24:30,425 --> 00:24:32,102
So what if I did?

454
00:24:34,626 --> 00:24:36,200
So what if I do?

455
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:39,090
Hey.

456
00:24:40,295 --> 00:24:42,340
Are we really gonna do this?

457
00:24:42,445 --> 00:24:44,100
You mean kiss? I hope so.

458
00:24:44,205 --> 00:24:45,621
No, I mean...

459
00:24:46,738 --> 00:24:49,620
get all blissed out on
each other, like...

460
00:24:50,035 --> 00:24:53,722
right before I leave for the
summer and we go to college.

461
00:24:54,046 --> 00:24:55,321
Why not?

462
00:24:55,516 --> 00:24:58,050
'Cause it's gonna suck
when we're apart?

463
00:24:58,156 --> 00:24:59,493
Yeah...

464
00:24:59,806 --> 00:25:02,883
but it's gonna be
great when we're not.

465
00:25:04,305 --> 00:25:07,410
Besides, I'm gonna send you
the dirtiest text messages.

466
00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:09,532
- Promise?
- Yeah.

467
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:13,922
You're so sweet, promising to type
me filthy things with your thumbs.

468
00:25:14,025 --> 00:25:16,712
Hey, anything for
the girl I love.

469
00:25:32,005 --> 00:25:33,123
Nathan?

470
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:35,361
- Hey.
- Hey. How'd it go?

471
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:36,620
Fine.

472
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:39,963
Will you listen to this part of my
speech and tell me if it works?

473
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,232
Yeah, sure. Let's hear it.

474
00:25:41,336 --> 00:25:42,032
Okay.

475
00:25:42,137 --> 00:25:44,211
"Now is the time
for us to shine,

476
00:25:44,318 --> 00:25:48,401
a time when our dreams are within
reach and possibilities, vast.

477
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:50,930
Now is the time for all of
us to become the people

478
00:25:51,037 --> 00:25:53,270
we've always dreamed of being."

479
00:26:20,848 --> 00:26:22,832
Stop! Stop!

480
00:27:05,965 --> 00:27:07,471
It's a girl!

481
00:27:12,777 --> 00:27:13,783
It's a girl?

482
00:27:13,886 --> 00:27:16,922
Lucas, say hello
to your sister.

483
00:27:45,436 --> 00:27:46,812
Hi.

484
00:27:47,697 --> 00:27:49,812
Look how beautiful she is.

485
00:27:49,915 --> 00:27:52,001
Yeah, I'm afraid to move,
or I'm gonna break her.

486
00:27:52,108 --> 00:27:53,900
You're not gonna break her.

487
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:55,423
Want to hold her?

488
00:27:56,577 --> 00:27:57,843
Yeah.

489
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,190
Okay. Support her head.

490
00:28:04,338 --> 00:28:06,061
Come here, you.

491
00:28:10,878 --> 00:28:13,340
Oh. Let's see her.

492
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:20,141
Wow. I'm officially
scared to death again.

493
00:28:22,676 --> 00:28:24,171
How's your mom doing?

494
00:28:24,908 --> 00:28:28,652
She's still unconscious...
but stable -- they said she did great.

495
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:33,880
Hey, I was wondering if you'd be
able to step out for a minute?

496
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,082
Go ahead. I'll watch her.

497
00:28:37,186 --> 00:28:38,530
It's just a minute.

498
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:41,381
I'll be right back, mom...

499
00:28:42,736 --> 00:28:46,273
and you... and you.

500
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:50,802
Unbelievable.

501
00:28:59,796 --> 00:29:03,493
Okay. I wanted to give you
this before graduation.

502
00:29:03,888 --> 00:29:04,861
Okay.

503
00:29:04,968 --> 00:29:06,863
I got something for you,
too, but it's at the house.

504
00:29:06,966 --> 00:29:08,740
Actually, that's not from me.
That's from your mom.

505
00:29:08,775 --> 00:29:11,023
She just hid it with me
so you wouldn't find it.

506
00:29:17,835 --> 00:29:18,961
What book is it?

507
00:29:20,488 --> 00:29:21,893
It's my novel.

508
00:29:21,997 --> 00:29:23,230
Your what?

509
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:26,040
She had it bound for me.

510
00:29:26,145 --> 00:29:27,741
I didn't even know she
knew I was writing it.

511
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:28,852
When did you --

512
00:29:29,777 --> 00:29:32,972
I guess there's not too much your
mom doesn't know about your life.

513
00:29:35,377 --> 00:29:37,991
"Lucas, I'm so proud of you.
Your words are wonderful.

514
00:29:38,097 --> 00:29:40,093
Don't be afraid to share
them with the world.

515
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,463
Follow through and finish this.

516
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:43,790
Remember...

517
00:29:44,715 --> 00:29:47,230
'There is a tide in
the affairs of men.'"

518
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,282
That's "Julius Caesar."

519
00:29:50,386 --> 00:29:52,332
Do you remember when
you gave me that book?

520
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:57,801
Wow.

521
00:29:58,248 --> 00:29:59,491
"Julius Caesar."

522
00:29:59,595 --> 00:30:02,073
"There's a tide in
the affairs of men --"

523
00:30:02,178 --> 00:30:03,680
or something like that.

524
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:11,213
"Love, mom."

525
00:30:13,576 --> 00:30:16,260
I really need her to be
my mom again, Haley.

526
00:30:17,286 --> 00:30:18,880
She will be.

527
00:30:19,535 --> 00:30:20,861
I know it.

528
00:30:39,827 --> 00:30:43,153
Pretty soon, you'll have a
beautiful baby of your own.

529
00:30:43,255 --> 00:30:44,970
Trying to freak me out, mom?

530
00:30:46,787 --> 00:30:49,701
And, by the way, if you can't make
it to graduation, that's okay.

531
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:51,320
At least dad will be there.

532
00:30:51,715 --> 00:30:52,852
No.

533
00:30:53,588 --> 00:30:56,460
If you see your father,
I want you to stay away from him.

534
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:57,820
Why?

535
00:30:58,568 --> 00:30:59,810
Nathan...

536
00:31:01,895 --> 00:31:03,963
this is gonna be hard
for you to hear,

537
00:31:04,315 --> 00:31:06,022
and the timing is horrible,

538
00:31:06,126 --> 00:31:08,930
but you're my son,
and I will always protect you.

539
00:31:09,037 --> 00:31:10,753
Mom, what's going on?

540
00:31:12,305 --> 00:31:14,261
It's about your uncle Keith.

541
00:31:30,008 --> 00:31:31,532
Daddy, what's going on?

542
00:31:31,568 --> 00:31:32,813
We had a slight
change of plans.

543
00:31:32,897 --> 00:31:33,761
What do you mean?

544
00:31:33,865 --> 00:31:36,061
Your mother wanted quiche,
but I hate quiche.

545
00:31:36,957 --> 00:31:39,320
Well, I have
something to tell you.

546
00:31:39,427 --> 00:31:40,953
My boyfriend's black.

547
00:31:41,058 --> 00:31:44,473
That's okay, honey.
My son's black, too. We deal with it.

548
00:31:44,647 --> 00:31:46,702
- But --
- Bevin Evan Mirskey,

549
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:48,283
you are in so much trouble.

550
00:31:48,385 --> 00:31:49,062
Why?

551
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,610
Because if you had introduced
us to Antwon sooner,

552
00:31:51,715 --> 00:31:53,942
we would have met
his parents sooner.

553
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,163
Hi, baby.

554
00:31:55,266 --> 00:31:57,320
Antwon! Get your butt out here

555
00:31:57,428 --> 00:32:00,112
and introduce us to your
beautiful girlfriend!

556
00:32:00,446 --> 00:32:03,200
All right, everyone,
just step back and observe the master.

557
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:04,450
Here we go.

558
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:05,842
I was looking
forward to quiche.

559
00:32:05,947 --> 00:32:07,070
You see?

560
00:32:07,267 --> 00:32:08,372
Hey, baby.

561
00:32:08,617 --> 00:32:10,571
See? I told you it wasn't
nothing to worry about.

562
00:32:12,705 --> 00:32:13,852
Hey, mom.

563
00:32:15,785 --> 00:32:18,253
I just wanted you to know
how good you did today.

564
00:32:19,468 --> 00:32:20,760
You and Keith.

565
00:32:22,556 --> 00:32:24,521
She's so beautiful.

566
00:32:25,017 --> 00:32:26,540
You're gonna be proud.

567
00:32:30,018 --> 00:32:32,182
But, you see,
you got to wake up...

568
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:35,743
because she doesn't
even have a name yet.

569
00:32:37,658 --> 00:32:41,520
You never told me
what it was gonna be.

570
00:32:42,966 --> 00:32:44,092
Luke?

571
00:32:44,406 --> 00:32:48,282
Hey, we should probably get going if
we're gonna make it to graduation on time.

572
00:32:51,247 --> 00:32:54,860
I kind of just...
thought I'd skip it.

573
00:32:55,597 --> 00:32:56,832
Okay.

574
00:32:57,276 --> 00:33:00,213
Before you do,
I think there something you should see.

575
00:33:05,086 --> 00:33:07,802
If you skip graduation,
we're all gonna skip with you.

576
00:33:10,328 --> 00:33:11,612
Even me, Luke.

577
00:33:11,715 --> 00:33:14,921
Remember what you told me about how
much I'd regret it if I skipped prom?

578
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:16,920
You were right.

579
00:33:17,135 --> 00:33:20,393
And I think your mom would want you
to graduate with all your friends.

580
00:33:20,495 --> 00:33:22,350
You can wait here,
or you can wait there.

581
00:33:22,455 --> 00:33:24,061
It's all the same waiting.

582
00:33:24,165 --> 00:33:26,222
I promise you I'll call.

583
00:33:26,328 --> 00:33:27,762
You should go.

584
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:30,173
Come on, Luke.

585
00:33:30,365 --> 00:33:32,920
We can't imagine doing
this without you.

586
00:33:39,406 --> 00:33:40,562
Yes!

587
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:53,133
Dad.

588
00:33:58,646 --> 00:34:00,743
I know you've been
a bad guy, dad,

589
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:03,133
and for a long time,
I wondered if you'd ever change,

590
00:34:03,238 --> 00:34:06,290
but lately,
I've seen you change.

591
00:34:06,395 --> 00:34:08,083
I've been so proud of you.

592
00:34:10,318 --> 00:34:11,942
But now they're saying...

593
00:34:13,687 --> 00:34:16,851
they're saying that you
killed uncle Keith, dad.

594
00:34:17,148 --> 00:34:19,900
Mom said it,
and Lucas said it, too, but...

595
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:26,331
I know they're wrong, okay,

596
00:34:26,435 --> 00:34:29,263
because I know you could
never do something like that.

597
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,710
So just --

598
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:32,670
Dad, just look me in the eye

599
00:34:32,778 --> 00:34:36,451
and tell me that they're wrong,
and I promise, I'll stand by you,

600
00:34:36,556 --> 00:34:38,383
because I love you, dad.

601
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:42,772
Just tell me they're
wrong, please.

602
00:34:49,518 --> 00:34:51,192
I can't do that.

603
00:35:00,268 --> 00:35:01,902
What happened to you?

604
00:35:04,205 --> 00:35:06,152
What happened to you, dad?

605
00:35:13,106 --> 00:35:16,751
The day Keith died, you died.
You understand me?

606
00:35:17,026 --> 00:35:20,770
My son will never know you.
You stay away from my family,

607
00:35:20,878 --> 00:35:22,642
and you stay away from me!

608
00:35:35,096 --> 00:35:36,193
Nathan.

609
00:35:43,616 --> 00:35:45,781
First time I've ever
come to Keith's grave.

610
00:35:48,085 --> 00:35:50,771
I was visiting with Camilla...

611
00:35:51,975 --> 00:35:54,131
looking for some guidance,

612
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:57,142
and I asked her to
send me a sign.

613
00:35:57,246 --> 00:35:59,273
I looked up, and I saw you.

614
00:36:00,765 --> 00:36:05,923
You know, there's a crummy little
school about three hours from here.

615
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:12,140
They haven't had a winning
basketball season in over 30 years.

616
00:36:12,247 --> 00:36:15,743
Gym smells terrible.
Nobody goes to the games.

617
00:36:16,605 --> 00:36:21,411
A man would be a damn fool to take
their vacant coaching position...

618
00:36:22,435 --> 00:36:26,253
or a damn fool that just
won the state championship.

619
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:29,023
You're gonna coach
another high school?

620
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,280
College.

621
00:36:31,776 --> 00:36:33,791
Took the job this morning.

622
00:36:35,936 --> 00:36:38,931
How would you like to
play for me next season?

623
00:36:45,045 --> 00:36:46,150
Thank you, coach.

624
00:36:46,256 --> 00:36:47,701
Don't thank me.

625
00:36:48,297 --> 00:36:49,720
Thank Haley.

626
00:36:59,565 --> 00:37:04,671
So, without further ado, I give you
Tree Hill High's graduating class.

627
00:37:05,505 --> 00:37:07,220
Chase Adams.

628
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:11,562
Richard Asplund.

629
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,172
Angela Brown.

630
00:37:19,507 --> 00:37:21,262
Brooke Davis.

631
00:37:35,965 --> 00:37:37,620
Sarah Huddleston.

632
00:37:38,888 --> 00:37:40,482
Marvin McFadden.

633
00:37:44,915 --> 00:37:46,381
Robert Moore.

634
00:37:47,305 --> 00:37:48,961
Bevin Mirskey.

635
00:38:00,915 --> 00:38:02,272
Peyton Sawyer.

636
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:10,230
Robert Maxwell Scanlon.

637
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,792
Jessica May Scarlow.

638
00:38:14,165 --> 00:38:15,621
Lucas Scott.

639
00:38:21,105 --> 00:38:22,602
Nathan Scott.

640
00:38:32,468 --> 00:38:34,322
Antwon Taylor.

641
00:38:38,326 --> 00:38:40,010
Ferguson Thompson.

642
00:38:44,476 --> 00:38:48,272
And graduating in absentia,
Rachel Gatina.

643
00:38:59,898 --> 00:39:03,321
And finally,
this year's class valedictorian,

644
00:39:03,428 --> 00:39:05,930
Haley James Scott.

645
00:39:22,807 --> 00:39:25,690
Distinguished guests, parents,

646
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:28,633
and this year's
graduating class...

647
00:39:30,726 --> 00:39:34,673
My best friend reminded me of
a quote by William Shakespeare

648
00:39:34,777 --> 00:39:36,762
that seems appropriate.

649
00:39:37,945 --> 00:39:41,210
"There is a tide in
the affairs of men,

650
00:39:41,516 --> 00:39:43,590
which, taken at the flood,

651
00:39:43,698 --> 00:39:45,411
leads on to fortune.

652
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:46,911
Omitted,

653
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:52,011
all the voyage of their life is
bound in shallows and in miseries."

654
00:40:03,977 --> 00:40:07,480
Mayor Scott, would you like
to hold your beautiful niece?

655
00:40:19,775 --> 00:40:23,283
"...On such a full sea
we are now afloat...

656
00:40:28,565 --> 00:40:31,261
...and we must take the
current when it serves,

657
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:33,400
or lose our ventures."

658
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:36,181
I think that what
that quote means

659
00:40:36,287 --> 00:40:38,220
is that life is short

660
00:40:38,328 --> 00:40:41,033
and opportunities are rare

661
00:40:41,137 --> 00:40:43,340
and we have to be vigilant
in protecting them --

662
00:40:43,448 --> 00:40:46,043
and not only the opportunities
to succeed, but...

663
00:40:46,146 --> 00:40:50,442
the opportunities to laugh,
to see the enchantment in the world,

664
00:40:50,545 --> 00:40:53,613
and... to live.

665
00:41:00,126 --> 00:41:02,082
Call Dr. Hudson!
She's crashing!

666
00:41:02,185 --> 00:41:04,053
'Cause life doesn't owe us anything.

667
00:41:04,155 --> 00:41:08,251
As a matter of fact, I think that
we owe something to the world.

668
00:41:09,088 --> 00:41:12,283
And if we can just believe...

669
00:41:19,257 --> 00:41:24,243
I'm sorry. I have more. I just...
think I'm having my baby.

670
00:41:36,006 --> 00:41:39,982
