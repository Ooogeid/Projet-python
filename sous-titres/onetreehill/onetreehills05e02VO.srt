You're brooke davis!

Yeah. Hi.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,700
You're... wearing me.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,400
Clothes over bro's
is my line.

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Yeah, i - I love it.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,300
Thanks.

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,900
And you are so pretty
in person.

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,400
Thanks.
So are you.

29
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,900
Okay, this hasn't happened to me
since college.

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,900
Right. Okay.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,700
Um...

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,800
Wow, uh, this hasn't happened
to me since college.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,300
Hi, luke.

34
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,100
Brooke davis.

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,100
Oh, i missed you.

36
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,400
So, what do you
want to do today?

37
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
I don't know.
Play, i guess.

38
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,800
Yeah, me, too.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,100
Don't you have a job?

40
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,100
What are you, the man?
I don't see you paying any rent.

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,100
That's because i don't have
any money.

42
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,300
Well,
that makes two of us.

43
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,000
Now, let's just
go over the drill.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If we see any hot chicks today,
who are you?

45
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,800
I'm an orphan
who needs surgery,

46
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,400
And you're paying for it,
'cause you're rich.

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Good man.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,900
Bl-Bl-Bl!

49
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,100
Whoa!

50
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,800
Soapbox derby.

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,000
Man, when i was a kid,
i always wanted to do this.

52
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,300
Me, too.

53
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,700
It's a good thing
you're still a kid,

54
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,200
'Cause we got two days
to pimp your ride.

55
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Can uncle mouth
help me pimp my ride?

56
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,700
I don't think so.

57
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,100
See, uncle mouth
finally got a j-O-B.

58
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,100
That spells "job."

59
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
Man, you're getting
way too smart.

60
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,200
It was a lot easier
when you was 3.

61
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,000
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,900
I'm marvin mcfadden,
and sports is coming up next.

63
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,200
Alice: what, exactly,
are you doing?

64
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,300
Oh, the station called about
the field-Reporter position?

65
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,900
Field reporter -

66
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,400
Little ambitious,
don't you think?

67
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,100
The job that
we called you about

68
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,300
Is an entry-Level
logger position.

69
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,300
We could hire a monkey
to do that,

70
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,800
But the freaks at peta
would more than likely picket.

71
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,700
But i guess i assumed -

72
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,700
First door on the left.

73
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,000
You watch the games,
you highlight the best plays,

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,600
And you leave the log
for on-Air.

75
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,500
If you cannot
accomplish that,

76
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,500
You are currently
wasting my time.

77
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,500
I'm sorry,
but you are still looking

78
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,900
For a reporter, aren't you?

79
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,400
The answer to your question,
yes.

80
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,700
Let us be honest -

81
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,800
You don't really have
the face for it, do you?

82
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,900
All right, good morning.

83
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,300
This is actually my first
official day as a teacher,

84
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,000
And you're my first
official class.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,500
So, congratulations.

86
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,400
Uh, my name is...

87
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,100
Haley...

88
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,600
James...

89
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,600
Quentin:
that is some fine ass.

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,300
All right, first of all,

91
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,700
That's no way to talk to a girl,
any girl,

92
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,400
And second of all,
that is absolutely no way

93
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,100
To speak to a teacher.

94
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sorry.
It was me.

95
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,700
Just trying to
give you a compliment.

96
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,800
What's your name?

97
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,300
Quentin fields.

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,800
Okay.
Sit down, quentin.

99
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Yes, ma'am.

100
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,400
Won't happen again,
miss james.

101
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,600
Actually, it's mrs. Scott.

102
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,800
Damn, that ass.

103
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,700
Okay, all right.
Get out.

104
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,000
You need to go to the office.

105
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,800
Oh, to the office.

106
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Maybe we could go
together, huh?

107
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,500
Maybe you could just
spank me right here.

108
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,400
Yeah, that's right.

109
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,000
Ooh, harder,
mrs. James-Scott!

110
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,400
All right, settle down.

111
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,200
Spank me, mrs. James-Scott!

112
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,400
I said, "settle down!"

113
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,400
Class!

114
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,600
Class!Class!
Class!Class!

115
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,800
I have just -
I have just -

116
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,500
I -

117
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,800
I -I -
I -I -

118
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,300
Baby, come back!

119
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,000
Hey, how much
do you love me?

120
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,500
I went to see lindsey,
luke's girlfriend.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I have good news
and bad news.

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,200
All right, luke and i haven't
been together for three years.

123
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,400
It's not why i'm home.

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I totally believe you.
Fine.

125
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,600
Ooh, the office.

126
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,000
They're just figuring out
i'm not in milan.

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,400
I bet ctoria's
having a cow.

128
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,200
You think maybe
you should call

129
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
And let her know you're alive? No.

130
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,100
No, i have a more important
question to ask you.

131
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,300
What happened after
lucas finished his book?

132
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,400
Hello?

133
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,200
Lucas:
hey, it's lucas.

134
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,600
I know it's been awhile,

135
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,300
But i'm having a book signing
in l.A. In a couple of days.

136
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,900
Yeah, i know.

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,600
I mean, i read about it.

138
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,400
Yeah, i've been pacing the house
for the last hour

139
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,000
Wondering if i should call,

140
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,500
Considering
how we left things.

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,700
No, it's okay.

142
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,600
It's actually really good
to hear your voice.

143
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,100
Yours, too.

144
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,900
Well, i was hoping, um...

145
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,100
I'd love to see you
if you're not too busy.

146
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,700
Um, yeah - Yeah, okay.

147
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,400
Sure, i'll be there.

148
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,500
That's great, peyton.

149
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,000
Well, then, i -
I'll see you soon, then.

150
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,300
See you soon.

151
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,100
Ame is lucas scott.

152
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,900
I'm the new head basketbal
coach of the tree hill ravens.

153
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,200
This is antwon taylor.

154
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,000
He's the new assistant
head coach.

155
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,700
You want our credentials?

156
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,900
They're hanging
right there.

157
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,100
I must congratulate you.

158
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,900
For some of you,
it took only four years

159
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,300
To destroy the legacy

160
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,900
Coh durham
took 35 years to build.

161
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,400
Nice work.

162
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,200
So, as of today, all 12
roster spots are available.

163
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,800
It doesn't matter
if you played last year.

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,900
In three days,
we'll have our final roster.

165
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,300
If you want to be on it,
then i would advise you go hard.

166
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,900
Skills?

167
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,800
I would definitely go hard.

168
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,200
One-On-Two drill.

169
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,800
Everybody line up
at half court.

170
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,300
Mama, i'm gonna race
in a soap-Opera derby.

171
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,500
What?

172
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,400
Hey.
How was your first day?

173
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,700
Um, horrible.

174
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,100
My first class, like,
attacked me,

175
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
And i ran out in tears,

176
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,800
And principal turner had to
finish the rest of my classes.

177
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,200
I'm sorry, hales.

178
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,200
They were awful, so mean -
Especially this one kid,

179
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,100
Who was, like,
sexually harassing me.

180
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,200
What?
Who was it?

181
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,700
Him.

182
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,900
Hello, there,
mrs. James-Scott.

183
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,900
We'll see you later,
okay?

184
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,300
You're late.

185
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,600
Yeah?

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,300
I'm also
your leading scorer.

187
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,500
No, you might have been
a leading scorer on a team

188
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
That won three conference games
all last season.

189
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,500
<I>but you are not
my leading scorer - Not yet.</I>

190
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,900
Whoa!Whoa!
Whoa!Whoa!

191
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,800
<I>man: seattle is
on the clock right now.</I>

192
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,600
<I>we'll get to the commissioner
in regards to their pick.</I>

193
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,700
<I>they going big?
They going small?</I>

194
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,400
Man: somebody help!
Somebody!

195
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,900
Well...

196
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,000
Well.

197
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,800
Don't look away.

198
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,000
The second and third greatest
nights of your life

199
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,400
Just walked back
into your world.

200
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,700
You looking all rock star
totally does it for me.

201
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,700
Very heroin chic, nate.
I like it.

202
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,200
What are you guys
doing here?

203
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,700
Well, lucas tells me
that you can walk,

204
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,200
But you need
a little incentive.

205
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,000
So we have come up
with a drill.

206
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,700
For every step you take...

207
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,800
We kiss.

208
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,700
Mmm.

209
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,000
Hey,
it's good to see you.

210
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,100
Nathan...

211
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,500
Hey!

212
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,800
Hi!

213
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,000
Hi!

214
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,900
What are you guys
doing here?

215
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,900
We came to see you
and -

216
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,000
Oh, jamie, sweetie,
come here.

217
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,200
There's people
i want you to meet.

218
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,800
Come on, it's okay.

219
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,600
This is brooke and peyton,
and this is our son, jamie.

220
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,400
Peyton: hey, jamie.
How are you?

221
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,000
Nate?

222
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,100
I missed you.

223
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,600
Man, i've always wanted
one of these things.

224
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,700
Yeah, me, too.

225
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,800
Me, too.

226
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,900
I think
we should paint it red.

227
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,100
You know, the red racer.

228
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,900
Yo, kid, talk to me
about the cape.

229
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,700
What's the real?

230
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,900
I'm a superhero.

231
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,900
Is that right?

232
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,700
Why don't you fly to the kitchen
and get me a beer?

233
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,800
So, what's your take on the
team's former leading scorer?

234
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,500
Quentin?
The kid's pretty good.

235
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,700
<I>the kid's really good.</I>

236
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,500
Now we just got to figure out

237
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
If we can get him to play
a team game, you know?

238
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,100
Can i have pudding?

239
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,300
You can read, right?

240
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,800
If the pudding says "junk"
or "fergie," you can have it.

241
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Thank you.

242
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,900
Hey, and just one, okay?

243
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,600
No, i mean, it's like,

244
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,800
I don't know
if they lost all those games

245
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,000
Because they didn't have enough
guys on the team like him.

246
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,000
<I>or maybe they just lost
because of him.</I>

247
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,300
You know
who he reminds me of.

248
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,800
Yeah.

249
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,600
Hi, daddy.
Did you see my basketball?

250
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,200
No.

251
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,800
You okay?

252
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,500
"I'm fine, wife.
How was your day?"

253
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,100
"Oh, you know, husband,
my day really sucked,

254
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,400
But thanks for asking."

255
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,500
And mine didn't?

256
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,800
That's just a little selfish,
don't you think?

257
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,100
No. No, i don't think.

258
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,800
And i didn't see you
lose your dream.

259
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,600
Maybe you need to
open up your eyes.

260
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,000
Where's jamie?
Jamie?

261
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,900
Jamie!

262
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,000
This belong to you?

263
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,500
Wine delivery
from new york city.

264
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,900
Wow, i called for that wine
two years ago.

265
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,800
Get in here!
Hi!

266
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,000
Ahh.

267
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,800
Come on.

268
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,900
Can i just ask why you decided
to become a nanny?

269
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,800
Honestly,
because i get paid

270
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,700
To work
with some really great kids.

271
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,700
Eventually, i'd like to maybe
go back to school

272
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,200
And study
to be a pediatrician -

273
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,700
Someday, when i have someone
else's life and income.

274
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,300
Look, haley, i know when you go
to interviews like this,

275
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,600
Both sides
are trying to figure out

276
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
How crazy
the other person is.

277
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,600
Are you doing that, too?

278
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,800
I get it, but i've taken
enough of your time.

279
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,100
You have my references,

280
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,400
And jamie seems like a wonderful
boy, so just let me know.

281
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,100
Either way,
it was great meeting you.

282
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,400
It was great to meet you, too.
Thank you so much.

283
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,200
Look, mama!
Me and daddy made mud!

284
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,400
I'm sorry.
Who am i kidding?

285
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,700
How soon
could you start?

286
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,900
Well, imagine that.
Brooke dav

287
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
What time is it?

288
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,700
Like, 8:30.

289
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,700
Oh, no. I told haley
i'd take jamie!

290
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,500
That was
some wild night, baby.

291
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,900
What time is it?

292
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,100
Like, 8:30.

293
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,800
Oh, no,
i'm late for work!

294
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,900
Jamie,
have you seen my shoes?

295
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,600
I'm supposed
to go and pick up -

296
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,200
Jamie.

297
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,800
What are you doing here?

298
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,400
Mommy brought me over.
She said not to wake you.

299
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,600
Right.

300
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,500
You ever had
a wine hangover?

301
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,700
I had a floppy-Eared bunny
named chester.

302
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,600
I got to go.
I'm late for work.

303
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,900
It's great to see you,
brooke.

304
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,100
Hi, jamie!

305
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Well, well, well.
Somebody just got strike two.

306
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,300
Look, alice, i think we got off
to the wrong start.

307
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,800
I just want you to know

308
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
That i'm honored
to be a part of your staff,

309
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,300
And i'm looking forward to
working for you and learning -

310
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,100
I really don't like you.

311
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,600
Well, um, what can i do
to change that?

312
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,400
Quit...
before i fire you.

313
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,500
Jamie, this thing
is really awesome.

314
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,700
Yeah.

315
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah?

316
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,200
What?

317
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,000
Aren't you excited
about big

318
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Ace?

319
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,500
<I>i guess,
but it's supposed to be my car,</i>

320
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
And they're not letting me
do anything.

321
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,300
Well, then, you better
stand up for yourself, huh?

322
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
What do you mean?

323
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,900
Well, like, what color
do you want it to be?

324
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,000
Red and blue like daddy's,

325
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,200
But they want it red,
like elmo.

326
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,400
And i hate elmo.
Grover's so much better.

327
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,800
Grover's blue.

328
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,300
I so agree with you.
Blue it is.

329
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,500
You've got to
take a stand, jamie.

330
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,300
If you start giving in now,

331
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,800
It's just gonna get worse,
trust me.

332
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm glad
you're my godmother.

333
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,600
Me, too, buddy.

334
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,600
Now let's go
get some paint.

335
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,300
Come here!

336
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,600
I t you!

337
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,700
Hi, principal turner.

338
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,100
Haley, i thought i'd join you
for a few days.

339
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,400
I can do this on my own.

340
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,700
I know,
but you're young,

341
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,300
And sometimes, the students
take advantage of that.

342
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,300
Let's get you walking,
and then you can run.

343
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,000
Skills: run, run, run!
Pick it up!

344
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,200
Blue team, two-On-Two zone!
Two-On-Two zone!

345
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,000
We don't play no zones,
coach.

346
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,700
You do, if i say so.

347
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,200
You stay in man to man,
i can do this.

348
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,800
Just take me home, peyton, okay?
I'm not feeling this today.

349
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,900
Maybe not,
but the doctors are.

350
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,300
The doctors
weren't the ones

351
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,100
With a piece of glass
in their spine

352
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,100
And nerve damage
four f'ing months ago.

353
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,600
Anyway, it's not like
i'll ever play basketball again.

354
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,300
Hey.

355
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,300
You know what?

356
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,400
First of all, shut up
and take a look around.

357
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,100
You have a life that any one
of these kids would die for.

358
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,200
And what's really sad is that
most of them probably will.

359
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,300
So, that morning,
i'm reading an article

360
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,100
About how
she's recently sober,

361
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,200
And that night,

362
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,800
She's in the booth next to me
at a club, wasted.

363
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,200
And then my label signs her
to a record deal.

364
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,200
I'm sorry.
I can't be a part of that.

365
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,500
Here's to not being
a part of it.

366
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,000
Here's to taming
my demonic english class.

367
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,900
No, no, we're not going there
'cause this song is insane.

368
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,100
Yeah.

369
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:58,900
Mouth!

370
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,500
Hi!

371
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,300
My boss hates me.

372
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,600
So, shut up and dance.

373
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,200
I think that's lindsey.
Hey.

374
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,200
Hey.

375
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,200
Hey, come here!
Hi!

376
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,400
How are you?
Hey, you.

377
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,600
I want you to meet
my best friend -

378
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,600
Not that guy.

379
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,400
I don't know
where she went.

380
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,500
Skills:
so, here's the plan.

381
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,900
I figure we do
a couple test runs,

382
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,200
You know,
work out the kinks.

383
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,900
Then tomorrow night,
big-Game james here

384
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,900
Gonna smoke
all those little brats.

385
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,900
Yeah, boy.

386
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,300
All right,
i give to you the red racer!

387
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,400
The blue bullet.

388
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,300
Brooke helped me.

389
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,400
Yeah.

390
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,600
Look, well,
it don't matter.

391
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,000
You ready to try it,
flash?

392
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
Figured that much.

393
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,400
So, check this out.

394
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,300
We're gonna use this mannequin
for the first run.

395
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,900
All right.

396
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,000
Let's roll!

397
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
Ohh.

398
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,600
Oh, man, we gonna have to
fix that.

399
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,800
Hi.

400
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,300
Oh, hi.

401
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,700
Lindsey.

402
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,300
Peyton.

403
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,300
I know this is awkward,
but i just wanted to say hi.

404
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,000
And i know i don't know you,
but i feel like i do.

405
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,500
At least, the version of you
from the book.

406
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,100
You seemed really brave.

407
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,400
Thanks.

408
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,600
Anyway, i hope to see you
around, peyton.

409
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,400
Take care.

410
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,000
Damn it, i really
didn't want to like her.

411
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,700
I know,
but she's great, right?

412
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,600
Sorry.

413
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,200
Haley?

414
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,200
Oh, carrie, hi.

415
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,600
Hi. Oh, my gosh, i probably
look like a boozehound.

416
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,900
I was just celebrating
with some friends.

417
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,800
You look fine.
You look great.

418
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
Really great.

419
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,200
Thanks.

420
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,500
Listen, i just
want you to know

421
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,400
That i appreciate
you taking a chance on me.

422
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,300
I'm gonna take good care
of jamie, i promise.

423
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,600
Oh, i know you will.
You're gonna do just fine.

424
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,700
Oh, thanks.
Well, i'll see you soon.

425
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,200
Okay, you have
a great night.

426
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,400
Bye.

427
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,800
Bye.

428
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,200
And, mouth, who was that?

429
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,400
Oh, that's carrie.
She's our new nanny.

430
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,800
I'm sorry.
Have you lost your mind?

431
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,700
She cannot be
your new nanny.

432
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,900
Why?

433
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,600
Uh, well, for starters,
have you looked at her?

434
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,200
She is way too hot.

435
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,400
Okay,
you two need to stop.

436
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,600
Why does everything
have to be about looks?

437
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,500
Maybe she's a great nanny
or a great field reporter.

438
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,200
Shouldn't that be the point
and not her looks?

439
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,200
Besides, if haley
doesn't hire her,

440
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,800
I won't get to see her
in a bikini.

441
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,000
Nice.

442
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,300
Damn, she was hot.

443
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,300
I've got to go, you guys.
I need to check up on nathan.

444
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,000
Seems like another life.

445
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,000
It was, for you.

446
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,600
I mean, i appreciate you
coming back and everything,

447
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,700
But considering the way
your phone's been blowing up,

448
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,500
You have a very busy,
very great life to get back to.

449
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,100
Okay.

450
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,200
I have a very important friend
who needs me.

451
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,200
<I>why did you come home,
peyton?</I>

452
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,300
I guess i was looking for
that inspiration i felt

453
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,800
When we wrote our names here,
you know?

454
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,100
I was fearless then,
brooke.

455
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,600
So, what happened
to that girl?

456
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,700
That girl became assistant
to the assistant.

457
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,400
So, if you
want to be the girl

458
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,800
You thought
you could be back then,

459
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,200
Start a label, peyton.

460
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,300
Do it yourself.

461
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,500
I am serious.

462
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,800
Peyton, i want to invest
in your label.

463
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,300
I believe in you.

464
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Okay?

465
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,200
Unless that's not really
why you came home.

466
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,800
I'm gonna return
those phone calls real quick.

467
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,600
Ask about
the record label.

468
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,400
I'm supposed to ask
about the label.

469
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,800
Yeah, brooke wants me
to start my own label here.

470
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,900
Are you gonna do it?

471
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,900
I met lindsey tonight.

472
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,300
She seems wonderful.

473
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
How long have you two
been together?

474
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,500
Why didn't you come
to the book signing

475
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,000
In l.A. Two years ago?

476
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,900
Wow.
This is a great turnout.

477
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,700
Listen, luke, i know this is
your first book as an author,

478
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,800
But it was also
my first book to edit,

479
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,300
And i had the best year
doing it.

480
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,100
So, i just wanted to
say thank you

481
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,100
And i'm proud of you.

482
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,900
Okay, you ready?

483
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,000
Yeah.

484
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
I guess everybody's here
that's coming.

485
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Hi.

486
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,400
Luke, i knew we weren't
meant to be.

487
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,400
I should get home.

488
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,100
See you.

489
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,500
Hey.

490
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,800
Thought you'd be asleep
by now.

491
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,200
How was your night?

492
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,300
Good.

493
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,600
I met peyton.

494
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,600
Let me ask you something.

495
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,000
Do all of your ex-Girlfriends
have to be so damn pretty?

496
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,500
Not like all my current
girlfriends.

497
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,300
Oh,
"all" better mean "one."

498
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,000
Do you know
if they're back for a while?

499
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,800
Brooke and peyton?

500
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,300
I don't know.

501
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,000
Brooke wants to help peyton
start her own record label,

502
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,800
Maybe in tree hill.

503
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,000
You think
she'll be good at it?

504
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,900
Yeah,
she'll be great at it.

505
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
Then if she needs help,
you should help her.

506
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,600
And i'll try my best
not to be insanely jealous.

507
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,200
Hey, as soon as brooke
and peyton get here,

508
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,300
We're gonna take off,
okay?

509
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,400
I'm not going.

510
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,500
What?

511
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,300
James is counting on you.

512
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,600
I don't want anybody
seeing me like this.

513
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,700
Has it occurred to you
that this isn't about you?

514
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,100
Haley, we're here!

515
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,100
Hey!

516
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,600
Hey.

517
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,400
Hi.
So, i have a surprise.

518
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,100
You're gonna like it.

519
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,100
I made jamie a little something
for his race.

520
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,700
Look, mama!

521
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,100
Oh, my goodness,
look at this!

522
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,000
This is
a real racing suit!

523
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,600
And i even made you a sponsor,
p. Sawyer.

524
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,700
Oh, yeah? Oh.

525
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,300
"Peyton sawyer, unemployed."
Thank you very much.

526
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,900
You're welcome.

527
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,200
I can't wait
for daddy to see me!

528
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,100
Oh, baby, listen,

529
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,800
Daddy's just not feeling
very well today.

530
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,200
I'm sorry.

531
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,000
He's not coming?

532
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,100
No. I'm sorry.

533
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,300
But everybody else
is gonna be there.

534
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,800
Oh, yeah, i hear
your uncle lucas is coming,

535
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,800
And skills and mouth
and all the guys.

536
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,800
I'm pretty sure he's gonna have
the biggest crowd there. Absolutely.

537
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,600
Yeah, okay?

538
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Okay, come on.

539
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,700
Come on.
Let's do it, dude.

540
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,100
Come on, buddy.
Let's win a race.

541
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,700
Go!

542
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,000
Here he is!

543
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,200
There he is,
lightning jamie scott!

544
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,700
Hey, cool outfit, man.

545
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,900
So, what's good, man?

546
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,200
You ready to win this thing
or what?

547
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,700
Okay, i'm gonna need you
to go ahead

548
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,600
And stop yelling
and listen to me.

549
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,600
<I>no, you are yelling.</I>

550
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,400
You are yelling,
and it's my company!

551
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,000
Why are you yelling at me?

552
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,600
There is a boy here.
Yes, a boy.

553
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
No, i don't -

554
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,300
Just - Ugh!

555
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,300
God!

556
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,600
Can i borrow your phone?

557
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,800
Hi, millicent, it's me.

558
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,600
No, it's great.
I'm just gonna need a new phone.

559
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,600
Okay, thanks.

560
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
Hey, buddy.

561
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,400
So, you're racing for
clothes over bro's now, huh?

562
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,300
Peyton sawyer, unemployed.

563
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,900
Man:
racers, to your cars!

564
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,500
Let's go get 'em, flash!

565
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,900
Brooke: all right, big guy,
here you go.

566
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,800
Now,
be careful, all right?

567
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,600
Ready?

568
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,800
All right, here we go.

569
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,100
Good?

570
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,000
Okay, racers,
when you're ready,

571
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Place both hands
on the steering wheel.

572
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Skills:
you can do

573
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,800
Hold up, hold up.
Car 23, are you okay?

574
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,400
I don't want to.

575
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,600
Okay. Mom?

576
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,200
Hey, baby.
What's going on?

577
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,700
I don't want to race,
mama.

578
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,200
Well, you don't have to,
but are you sure?

579
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,800
I mean, i think it's gonna be
really fun.

580
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,700
I want to talk to brooke.

581
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,600
What's up, handsome?

582
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,600
I don't want to do it,
but i like my racing suit.

583
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,900
The suit's yours,

584
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,700
But are you sure
you don't want to race?

585
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,500
It's my life.
I'm taking a stand.

586
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,900
Is that okay?
Yes, that's okay, honey.

587
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,900
Come here.

588
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,400
Sorry, uncle skills.

589
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,000
Skills:
it's okay, buddy.

590
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,700
You hear that?

591
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,500
My man is taking a stand,
blazing his own trail.

592
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,800
Follower.

593
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,200
Well, he didn't race.
He was afraid.

594
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,200
You might know something
about that.

595
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,400
We're all afraid.

596
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,600
Yeah, but he's 4,

597
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,100
And he needed his dad,
and his dad wasn't there.

598
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,300
Nice work, dan.

599
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,200
Are you gonna say anything,

600
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,600
Or are you just
gonna sit there

601
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,300
Like you have
for the last four months?

602
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,800
You gonna get drunk,
maybe pout a little, cry?

603
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,900
You don't get it,
do you?

604
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,600
I used to be somebody, haley.
Do you understand that?

605
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,200
Do you understand
what that means?

606
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,700
I used to be nathan scott,
and i was great.

607
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,900
And i should have
walked away, okay?

608
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,900
I know that,
and i didn't do it.

609
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,400
And now i'm nothing,
and i have nothing.

610
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,300
You have nothing?!

611
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,000
You have a beautiful son
who is here!

612
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,200
<I>i am here!</I>

613
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,300
You have got to figure out

614
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,600
Who you're gonna be
in this, nathan,

615
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,200
Because this version of you
does not work for us.

616
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,900
I cannot keep living
like this, okay?

617
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,600
Do you understand
what i'm saying?

618
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,000
One more night
like this, nathan,

619
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,000
<I>and i promise you,
you will have nothing!</I>

620
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,200
Little early,
don't you think?

621
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,100
Usually don't start my hard
drinking till at least noon.

622
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,400
Come here.

623
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,300
I want to
show you something.

624
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,500
I talked to my mom,

625
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:46,600
And, um... we decided
we want you to have it.

626
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,700
Rent-Free,
under one ition -

627
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,200
That it becomes office space
for your new label.

628
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,300
Luke...

629
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,500
And i've already talked
to brooke,

630
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,200
So i don't think you have
any more excuses.

631
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,500
You know
that four years ago

632
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,300
I would have jumped at this.

633
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,500
But what?

634
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,800
Doesn't seem
so cut-And-Dry anymore?

635
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,300
'Cause it's not.

636
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,000
I wrote a novel,
and i can't ite a second one.

637
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,800
Mouth's boss
apparently hates him.

638
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,900
Nathan missed his dream
by a breath.

639
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,000
That's life.

640
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,100
So, you couldn't change
the world from los angeles.

641
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
Change it here.

642
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,800
I know you can do it.

643
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,200
And so do you.

644
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,600
Just think about it.

645
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,000
<I>i was there, luke.</I>

646
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,700
At your book signing
in l.A.

647
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,000
So, i just wanted
to say thank you

648
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,400
And i'm proud of you.

649
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,600
Okay, you ready?

650
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,700
Yeah.

651
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,400
I was there, lucas.

652
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,300
I was so proud of you.

653
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,700
But we hadn't talked
in a long time,

654
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,200
And i saw you with lindsey,

655
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,600
And i figured you guys
were together,

656
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,400
Which, clearly,
you are, and...

657
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,000
I like her.

658
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,400
I do.

659
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,400
But do you remember when
you first joined the ravens,

660
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,800
And you took all my sketches
over to thud without asking?

661
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,800
And do you remember
what you said that night

662
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,200
That you entered the gym
for the first time?

663
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,500
"Your art matters.

664
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,400
It's what got me here."

665
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,700
Yeah.

666
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,500
It's like
you touched my soul.

667
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,900
And a few days ago,
i was ready to quit again.

668
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,900
But you saved me

669
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,500
With the words you wrote
about me in your novel.

670
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,500
So, if you're struggling
to write the next one...

671
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,200
You should know...

672
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,900
That your artters,
lucas.

673
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,600
It's what got me here.

674
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,700
Morning.

675
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,800
Sit down, mr. Fields.

676
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,600
I think we need
a little break, hmm?

677
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,000
Like, for the rest
of the hour.

678
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,500
What do you say, class, huh?
Who's with me?

679
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,100
Any student who walks out
that door fails this quarter.

680
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,100
I'm not gonna stop you.
I'm just gonna fail you.

681
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,100
Say goodbye
to extracurricular activities.

682
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,900
Say goodbye to sports,
like basketball.

683
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,500
Do you understand
that the rest of your life

684
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,700
Is being shaped right now?

685
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,800
It's up to you.

686
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,000
You can walk out that door
and fail this class

687
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And just take your chances.

688
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,200
Or you can sit down, listen,

689
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,400
And learn from somebody
that's been there.

690
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,800
The choice is yours.

691
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,600
The rest of your life
is a long time.

692
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,200
And whether you know it or not,
it's being shaped right now.

693
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,200
You can choose to blame
your circumstances on fate

694
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,100
Or bad luck or bad choices.

695
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,700
Or you can fight back.

696
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,500
Aah!

697
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,700
I'm nathan scott,

698
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And i have too much to lose.

699
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,000
Haley: things aren't always
gonna be fair in the real world.

700
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,000
That's just the way it is.

701
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
But for the most part,
you get what you give.

702
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,500
This somkind of joke?

703
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,600
No, i'm afraid
you didn't make the team.

704
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,900
You understand, without me,
you're gonna lose every game.

705
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,900
Oh, i think you're wrong.

706
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,900
But if you are right,

707
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,100
Then we're going to lose
as a team.

708
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,000
Mr. Fields?

709
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,100
I hear you've been disrupting
your english class.

710
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,200
I wouldn't recommend
you keep that up.

711
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,500
This ain't over.

712
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,100
<I>it's "this isn't over."</I>

713
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,900
Haley: let me ask you all
a question.

714
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,400
What's worse - Not getting
everything you wished for...

715
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,000
Well, congratulations, men.

716
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,700
You are the new
tree hill ravens.

717
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,300
Let's go to work.

718
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,200
...or getting it,
but finding out it's not enough?

719
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,000
I do love my company.

720
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I just...

721
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,000
I want to run it from here.

722
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,800
I know it wasn't the plan.

723
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,100
It's my life.
I'm taking a stand.

724
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,300
Bye.

725
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,000
It's perfect.
I'll take it.

726
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,300
Thank you.

727
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,500
Help me with this.
Come here.

728
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,300
Haley:he rest of your life
is being shaped right now.

729
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,500
With the dreams you chase...

730
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,000
The choices you make...

731
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,000
Jamie, wake up.

732
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,400
Hey, we're going out, okay?
Get ready.

733
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,600
Where?

734
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,000
It's a surprise.

735
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,100
And, hey, buddy,
bring your cape.

736
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,500
...and the person
you decide to be.

737
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,400
Lindsey: you remember
why i gave you that?

738
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,500
We went to dinner
after the signing.

739
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,200
It was our first date.

740
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,700
You coming to bed?

741
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,200
Actually, um...

742
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,600
I think i'm gonna write
for a while.

743
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,300
That's great, luke.

744
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,600
You know, son, there's gonna be
a lot of times in your life

745
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,800
When you're afraid.

746
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,200
Being afraid is okay,

747
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,500
But if you don't work
through that fear,

748
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,800
You might miss out
on some pretty great things.

749
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,800
Are you afraid, daddy?

750
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,000
Sometimes.

751
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,700
You?

752
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,100
Sometimes.

753
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,400
Then we'll do this
together.

754
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,800
On the count of three.

755
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,800
One, two, three!

756
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,600
The rest of your life
is a long time.

757
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,800
And the rest of your life
starts right now.

758
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,100
