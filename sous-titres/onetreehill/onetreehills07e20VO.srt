1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,900
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,419
Where did you even get this?

3
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:05,100
It was e-mailed to me this morning.

4
00:00:05,183 --> 00:00:06,800
Julian, we're being blackmailed.

5
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,700
You filmed us having sex?

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,800
You found my computer?

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,800
No. But someone did.

8
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,900
And now Julian and his
father are being blackmailed

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,400
for 1 million dollars thanks to you!

10
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,308
We just said we were
getting the tape out there.

11
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,500
The plan was never to blackmail
these people for money.

12
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,900
Look, we got to tell Brooke, all right?

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
She's got no idea...

14
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,100
Look, I told Brooke I was taking a lover.

15
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,700
You just need to relax.

16
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,700
I came home for you because I love you.

17
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,400
It's just, things are different.

18
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,600
Is there someone else?

19
00:00:29,683 --> 00:00:30,719
Maybe.

20
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:32,403
- Is you, isn't it?
- Yes, but...

21
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:37,825
Thanks for sleeping with
my girlfriend, buddy.

22
00:00:37,908 --> 00:00:39,630
I'm being deported.

23
00:00:39,713 --> 00:00:40,670
Marry me.

24
00:00:40,753 --> 00:00:41,966
What did you just say?

25
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,078
Marrying me fixes everything.

26
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:47,518
Somebody bought your portrait.
She's right there.

27
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:50,634
Remember the tennis player that
wouldn't take no for an answer?

28
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,338
She is the girl who bought
my portrait tonight.

29
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:54,509
That Katie girl?

30
00:00:54,592 --> 00:00:56,018
Why do you have a photo with her?

31
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:57,321
Because it's not her.

32
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,432
It's Sara.

33
00:00:59,505 --> 00:01:01,828
Even though she doesn't
show it all the time,

34
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:05,330
deep down inside, your mom is still
very sad that your grandma died.

35
00:01:05,413 --> 00:01:06,931
Mom's gonna be okay, right?

36
00:01:07,014 --> 00:01:08,714
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

37
00:02:29,994 --> 00:02:32,997
Welcome to Brooke's spa.
We hope you enjoy your stay.

38
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,008
Oh!

39
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:38,822
Trust m, it's great for the skin.

40
00:02:38,905 --> 00:02:40,139
In that case...

41
00:02:45,983 --> 00:02:47,231
Seriously?

42
00:02:47,314 --> 00:02:49,733
That thing has been ringing nonstop.

43
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:51,135
Didn't the shoot just end?

44
00:02:51,218 --> 00:02:53,670
Yeah, but editing just started.

45
00:02:53,753 --> 00:02:55,072
You just did the thing.

46
00:02:55,155 --> 00:02:57,141
What thing?

47
00:02:57,224 --> 00:03:00,144
Whenever you're passionate about
something, your eyebrows tighten up

48
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:02,847
I saw it a lot on set.

49
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,949
And even though I think it's kind of sexy,
m worried about you.

50
00:03:06,032 --> 00:03:08,452
Why? Because I'll never win
the world poker championship?

51
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:10,954
No. Because when you're
passionate about something,

52
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:12,890
you put everything you have into it.

53
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:16,360
Have you stopped for one second to relax?

54
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:18,996
Yes. For about five hours every night.

55
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,597
Sleeping doesn't count.

56
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,166
I'm serious, Julian.

57
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:24,768
I need you to take care of yourself

58
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:28,005
because I want you to live
for a long, long time.

59
00:03:28,088 --> 00:03:31,375
Well, I will as long as I have you.

60
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:34,393
Brooke's spa will always be
here to help you recuperate.

61
00:03:42,902 --> 00:03:44,143
Aah!

62
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:56,000
Alexander did what to Victoria?

63
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,305
Actually, it was Victoria
doing things to Alexander.

64
00:03:59,668 --> 00:04:00,739
Ew.

65
00:04:00,923 --> 00:04:05,145
Totally ew but totally awesome.

66
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:07,013
And you and Josh made a sex tape.

67
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:08,715
I don't know which is worse.

68
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:11,352
I do. But just for the record,
Josh made the tape.

69
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:12,820
I just suffered through it.

70
00:04:12,903 --> 00:04:13,755
No way.

71
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:14,938
Yes way.

72
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:18,259
Oh, I almost forgot.

73
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:20,362
Skills punched out Melvin.

74
00:04:28,553 --> 00:04:30,439
- It's illegal.
- It's not.

75
00:04:30,522 --> 00:04:34,043
It's absolutely illegal for me to marry
someone just to stay in the country.

76
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,229
Not if there are real feelings involved.

77
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:42,214
Look, it's late.

78
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,540
Take the night to think about it.

79
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:48,539
You can say "I do" in the morning.

80
00:05:27,322 --> 00:05:29,842
Someone's up early this morning.

81
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:32,511
Nervous for your music-video shoot?

82
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:33,679
Ugh.

83
00:05:34,897 --> 00:05:38,833
You'll do great, Hales. You always do.

84
00:05:41,437 --> 00:05:43,456
Have a good run, dad.

85
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:45,124
Thanks, buddy.

86
00:05:45,207 --> 00:05:46,607
So, mom, what's for breakfast?

87
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:09,849
What do you think? It's our new campaign.

88
00:06:09,932 --> 00:06:12,352
I'm calling it "The blunder down under."

89
00:06:12,435 --> 00:06:14,554
I think my hair looks amazing,

90
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:16,890
but that flag needs to be much bigger.

91
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:18,191
Mother!

92
00:06:18,274 --> 00:06:19,192
Brooke.

93
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:20,460
He's half your age.

94
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:21,895
Lucky me.

95
00:06:21,978 --> 00:06:24,164
I'm serious. What are you thinking?

96
00:06:24,247 --> 00:06:27,368
I'm sorry you're offended that
Alexander and I are lovers now.

97
00:06:27,451 --> 00:06:30,471
No, I'm just offended that you
decided to display that love

98
00:06:30,554 --> 00:06:32,073
in front of all my friends.

99
00:06:32,156 --> 00:06:35,978
Oh, please. Cougars are in now.

100
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:37,695
Morning, Brooke.

101
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:40,265
Doughnut?

102
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,969
Have fun with your "cub."

103
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:56,600
Please.

104
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,034
You've got 30 seconds.

105
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,335
You're used to working
in that timeframe, right?

106
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,505
Last night isn't what you think.

107
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:05,407
What I think is you're a jerk.

108
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,143
What I saw was you making
out with another guy.

109
00:07:08,226 --> 00:07:10,645
Haven't you ever done something
that you didn't mean to do?

110
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:12,814
Yes. I had sex with you.

111
00:07:12,897 --> 00:07:16,651
I would appreciate it if you
didn't tell anyone what you saw.

112
00:07:16,734 --> 00:07:18,452
Yeah? Well, I'd appreciate it

113
00:07:18,535 --> 00:07:20,721
if you didn't tape me having sex with you.

114
00:07:20,804 --> 00:07:22,355
Oh, wait. You already did.

115
00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:24,357
I shouldn't have done that.

116
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,759
And I'm sorry.

117
00:07:25,842 --> 00:07:29,948
But I'm asking you,
please... don't tell anyone.

118
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:32,265
Josh is gay.

119
00:07:32,348 --> 00:07:34,768
Alex, I understand you're upset.

120
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:37,623
True, but I also caught him sticking
his tongue down to some guy's throat.

121
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,342
are you sure it wasn't
a boyish-looking girl?

122
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:43,877
It was a guy. Maybe you'll
meet him at the wrap party.

123
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,280
There's not gonna be a wrap party.

124
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:49,299
No wrap party? Kind of cheap, isn't it?

125
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,753
Not really. Considering
there are two leads

126
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:55,958
decided to cost the film an extra
million dollars with their sex tape.

127
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,194
Josh made the tape.
I just suffered through it.

128
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,044
You can also suffer through no wrap party.

129
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,572
It's kind of creepy, right?

130
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,275
That this Katie girl looks just like Sara

131
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,477
and she bought the picture of you.

132
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,280
Yeah, it's weird.

133
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:21,065
But maybe it's just that...
weird but harmless.

134
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:25,670
How come you never told me about
her whenever you first met her?

135
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:29,591
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

136
00:08:29,674 --> 00:08:31,826
You know, but with your mom being sick,

137
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:33,376
it just didn't seem important.

138
00:08:34,878 --> 00:08:37,097
As important.

139
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,333
It's okay.

140
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:43,403
Mean, like you said,
hopefully she's just harmless, right?

141
00:08:43,486 --> 00:08:45,620
Either that or completely psychotic.

142
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:50,343
Listen, I'm sure there's
nothing to worry about.

143
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:52,212
But just in case, I'll make some calls

144
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:54,848
and see if I can find out more about her.

145
00:08:54,931 --> 00:08:57,299
And, babe, I am sorry for not telling you.

146
00:09:00,003 --> 00:09:01,937
It's okay.

147
00:09:10,547 --> 00:09:12,533
I heard you had a rough night.

148
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:13,852
Yeah.

149
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:18,840
You guys look so young.

150
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:22,025
I wish I would have known
you in high school.

151
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:27,048
Do you want to talk about it?

152
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:30,051
It's not like Lauren and I
planned any of this, you know?

153
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:32,027
It just sort of happened.

154
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,406
But you like her?

155
00:09:35,218 --> 00:09:36,252
I do.

156
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:40,169
Then you should talk to Skills.
Tell him that.

157
00:09:40,987 --> 00:09:43,881
You guys have been friends a long time.

158
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,854
I should probably be getting to work.

159
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,173
Thanks for stopping by, Millie.
It means a lot.

160
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:54,658
After all you've done for me,
it's the least I could do.

161
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,383
Can I ask you a question?

162
00:10:00,742 --> 00:10:01,742
Sure.

163
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:04,228
Do you ever miss me?

164
00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:06,355
Of course.

165
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:08,492
Thanks.

166
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,177
That means a lot, too.

167
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,616
Look like you didn't
sleep much last night.

168
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:24,399
That's because I didn't.

169
00:10:25,906 --> 00:10:27,183
Sounds good.

170
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:30,446
Dance with me.

171
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,966
Grubbs...

172
00:10:32,957 --> 00:10:34,817
Just dance with me.

173
00:10:37,835 --> 00:10:39,869
Practice for the wedding.

174
00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:43,824
I can't marry you.

175
00:10:44,606 --> 00:10:46,026
Why not?

176
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:48,128
We dance good together.

177
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:50,630
That's not a reason to get married.

178
00:10:50,713 --> 00:10:53,633
It's a start.

179
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:55,635
Listen to me.

180
00:10:55,718 --> 00:10:58,138
We need to focus on the
album... your album.

181
00:10:58,221 --> 00:11:00,073
And... and we don't have much time.

182
00:11:00,156 --> 00:11:03,844
The music's good, Michael.

183
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:06,228
Now you just have to find the words.

184
00:11:14,471 --> 00:11:16,638
Hey, Skills. Can I talk to you?

185
00:11:18,775 --> 00:11:20,160
Where y'all going?

186
00:11:20,243 --> 00:11:22,162
Laundry.

187
00:11:22,245 --> 00:11:23,746
Cooking class?

188
00:11:33,656 --> 00:11:36,658
You're my best friend, Skills.
And I just...

189
00:11:38,661 --> 00:11:41,381
Lauren and I were just
hanging out, you know?

190
00:11:41,464 --> 00:11:43,965
It's not like we planned this.

191
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,116
There's my guy!

192
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:18,919
- I wanted to check on you. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

193
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:21,198
I'm glad you did, though.
I need to ask you a question.

194
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,423
Shoot.

195
00:12:22,506 --> 00:12:25,727
Right after Skills punched me,
were your mom and Alexander...

196
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,263
Yes. Don't remind me. Thanks.

197
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:30,832
I left the store to avoid them.

198
00:12:30,915 --> 00:12:32,433
Scandalous.

199
00:12:32,516 --> 00:12:34,517
Not as scandalous as two
best friends fighting.

200
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,739
- What?
- Well, it's just funny, hearing that from the girl

201
00:12:38,822 --> 00:12:41,875
who wore a black eye to prom,
courtesy of her bff.

202
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,377
Okay. Well, I remember a certain someone

203
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,946
encouraging me to make up with Peyton...

204
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:50,483
Something about too much
history to just walk away.

205
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:52,286
Thank you for that, by the way.

206
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:54,956
If it weren't for P. Sawyer,
I would have never met Julian.

207
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,758
You're welcome.

208
00:12:56,841 --> 00:12:58,493
So, what now?

209
00:12:58,576 --> 00:13:00,261
I'm very well versed in girl code,

210
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:02,598
but I thought guy code didn't
extend past a high five.

211
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:03,848
Usually.

212
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,168
But when a guy really cares about a girl,

213
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:08,404
guy code is pretty much the same.

214
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:09,972
I feel horrible.

215
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,175
Well, have you guys talked about it?

216
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,978
I tried. He walked away.

217
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:17,481
I'm sorry, buddy. That sucks.

218
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,978
Yeah.

219
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:29,827
"Brooke Davis caught in
sex act with boy toy"?!

220
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,378
That sucks worse.

221
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,989
Skills... round two.

222
00:13:58,306 --> 00:13:59,858
How can you do this to me?

223
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:01,927
We broke up, Antwon.

224
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,829
Yeah, but only because of geography.

225
00:14:03,912 --> 00:14:06,432
You really think that's all it was?

226
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:08,434
You left. We barely talked.

227
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:12,052
And... and that's okay,
but don't put this all on me.

228
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:16,140
But you stopped calling.

229
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:18,625
I didn't even know you were coming home

230
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:22,895
yeah, but with my best friend?

231
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:28,385
You must feel guilty.
That's why you came over here, right?

232
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:31,755
I came over here to tell you to
stop being a jerk to your friend.

233
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,658
So, that's it?
You're choosing Mouth over me?

234
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,460
I didn't choose anyone,

235
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,178
but this version of you isn't helping.

236
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:49,507
You're not helping.
You're not even listening.

237
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,275
Haley!

238
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:53,611
Grubbs proposed to me.
Do you believe that?

239
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:55,613
I... I mean, maybe I do like him.

240
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:58,215
But like isn't love.
And... and like isn't marriage.

241
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,117
Anyway, enough about me.

242
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,785
We should be focusing on your music video.

243
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,087
They're expecting you in wardrobe.

244
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,588
After that, hair and makeup.

245
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,505
The live portion will be at Tric...

246
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,588
"Oh, thanks, Miranda."

247
00:15:26,896 --> 00:15:28,897
Five minutes, Haley.

248
00:15:56,593 --> 00:15:57,679
Alex.

249
00:15:57,762 --> 00:15:59,948
I just want to apologize
about the sex tape.

250
00:16:00,031 --> 00:16:02,352
I know you and Julia put
a lot into this film.

251
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:05,656
The sex tape was yesterday's problem.

252
00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:07,991
You put a lot into this film, too.

253
00:16:08,074 --> 00:16:10,761
You did great work. Maybe your best work.

254
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:14,864
But that won't matter if
nobody shows up to see it.

255
00:16:15,605 --> 00:16:19,820
You need to keep Josh's...
personal life under wraps.

256
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:22,773
Our film is a love story
between a guy and a girl,

257
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,108
not a guy and a guy.

258
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:27,077
I think that's why they call it acting.

259
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,682
How many openly gay
leading men can you name?

260
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:34,618
Doesn't make it right.

261
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:37,688
Doesn't make it okay.
It's just the way it is.

262
00:16:37,771 --> 00:16:40,991
I just don't think it matters.
I hope it doesn't.

263
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:42,893
But we can't afford to take that risk.

264
00:16:42,976 --> 00:16:45,077
Julian can't afford it.

265
00:16:52,987 --> 00:16:55,540
You have until tonight to
give Paul his money back.

266
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:58,410
What's that supposed to mean?

267
00:16:58,493 --> 00:16:59,844
How could you do this to us?

268
00:16:59,927 --> 00:17:02,013
And to the movie? And to Alex,
for that matter?

269
00:17:02,096 --> 00:17:03,414
Hey, I'm an actor, okay?

270
00:17:03,497 --> 00:17:05,449
I travel a lot. The road gets lonely.

271
00:17:05,532 --> 00:17:08,119
You know what? Save it. Alex told me.

272
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:10,121
You didn't think we would
put two and two together

273
00:17:10,204 --> 00:17:11,355
with the extortion?

274
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:14,525
I'd have you arrested,
if it wasn't for the film.

275
00:17:14,608 --> 00:17:17,910
I wasn't behind the extortion.
I wanted the tape to get out.

276
00:17:22,615 --> 00:17:25,435
My ex-boyfriend is threatening to out me.

277
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:27,537
That's not my problem.

278
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,240
One bad Indie film isn't
gonna kill my career,

279
00:17:30,323 --> 00:17:31,923
but a scandal like this could.

280
00:17:34,327 --> 00:17:36,446
A scandal like this
could kill us right now.

281
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:38,849
Oh, stop being so dramatic.
U think that's dramatic?

282
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,384
Wait till I have you fire Alexander.

283
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:42,553
You wouldn't. I might.

284
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:44,856
How could you do something
like that in public?!

285
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,257
And better question...

286
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,160
What imbecile would mistake
me for my mother?!

287
00:17:48,243 --> 00:17:50,562
Maybe it's not that bad.

288
00:17:50,645 --> 00:17:52,598
"Clothes over blows"?!

289
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:54,566
It's the second biggest
scandal of the week!

290
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:56,001
Well, what's the first?

291
00:17:56,084 --> 00:17:58,152
Oh, God.

292
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,279
Grubbs, you seen Haley?

293
00:18:07,362 --> 00:18:09,715
Uh, I think she's with Miranda.

294
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:12,184
Can I get you something
to drink while you wait?

295
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:13,468
Yeah, sure.

296
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:16,390
What'll it be?

297
00:18:16,473 --> 00:18:18,793
You've never asked me that before.

298
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:21,529
I'm a little off my game today.

299
00:18:21,612 --> 00:18:23,598
Just Miranda.

300
00:18:23,681 --> 00:18:26,617
Ah. That sounds like
when I first met Haley.

301
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:29,649
I'll have a whiskey and water.

302
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,710
Actually, you know what?
It's still daylight outside.

303
00:18:34,793 --> 00:18:36,293
Hold the whiskey.

304
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:41,217
I mean, at least Haley liked you.

305
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,251
Miranda just keeps shooting me down.

306
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:45,054
Haley hated me in the beginning.

307
00:18:45,137 --> 00:18:47,256
How did you change things?
What did you do?

308
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:50,627
Nothing. There was nothing I could do.

309
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,013
One day, she just decided let me in.

310
00:18:55,515 --> 00:18:57,218
You can only do what you do, man.

311
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:02,040
Nathan, have you seen Haley?

312
00:19:02,123 --> 00:19:04,658
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

313
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:11,329
No, I didn't know that.
Can you tell me why Katie was...

314
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:16,054
Yeah, any information would be helpful.

315
00:19:16,137 --> 00:19:19,356
And could you have Tanesha give me a call?

316
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:21,740
Great. Thank you.

317
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,600
What can I get you boys?

318
00:19:57,356 --> 00:20:00,176
Can I get a grilled cheese
with chicken fingers,

319
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:02,561
extra fries, and a chocolate milkshake?

320
00:20:05,064 --> 00:20:08,685
What? I had leftover Chinese
for breakfast. I'm starving.

321
00:20:08,768 --> 00:20:10,086
Okay.

322
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:11,903
And a vanilla shake for me.

323
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:17,909
So... how much did you miss your Uncle Skills?

324
00:20:20,212 --> 00:20:23,600
Oh, come on, man.
It better be more than that.

325
00:20:23,683 --> 00:20:26,703
That's what I'm talking about.

326
00:20:26,786 --> 00:20:28,338
Can I tell you a secret?

327
00:20:28,421 --> 00:20:29,706
Let's hear it.

328
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:32,909
I know someone who missed
you even more miss Lauren.

329
00:20:32,992 --> 00:20:35,812
She was pretty sad that you left.

330
00:20:35,895 --> 00:20:38,114
I bet she's happy now that you're back.

331
00:20:38,376 --> 00:20:40,416
I don't know, Dawg.

332
00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:43,820
Things are different now. She moved on.

333
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,822
What's moved on?

334
00:20:45,905 --> 00:20:49,058
Mouth stole her from me.

335
00:20:49,141 --> 00:20:50,946
You believe that? My friend.

336
00:20:51,644 --> 00:20:54,564
Or at least my ex-friend.

337
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:57,367
So you're not gonna be
friends wit Mouth anymore

338
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,068
because he stole miss Lauren from you?

339
00:20:59,151 --> 00:21:02,138
Yeah, well, friends just
don't do that, Jamie.

340
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:04,274
Well, you stole miss
Lauren away from me first,

341
00:21:04,357 --> 00:21:06,324
and we're still friends.

342
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,500
You want the bad news
or the really bad news?

343
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,500
How about the bad news?

344
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:16,876
Well, your girlfriend

345
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:18,996
is the second biggest
Internet scandal of the day.

346
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:21,830
"Brooke Davis caught in
sex act with boy toy!"

347
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,852
I cannot believe they
confused me with my mother!

348
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:28,321
Well, in their defense,

349
00:21:28,404 --> 00:21:30,622
she was being blocked by
Alexander's naked body.

350
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:34,961
Which brings me to the really bad news.

351
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:39,198
"Alex Dupre and Josh
Avery in steamy sex tape.

352
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,633
Click here to watch."

353
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,010
They released the sex tape.

354
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:53,913
I know. I sold it.

355
00:21:53,996 --> 00:21:55,815
I'm sorry. You did what?

356
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,462
I did what was best for the film.

357
00:21:57,545 --> 00:21:59,756
We had to cover our investment.
Don't take it personally.

358
00:21:59,942 --> 00:22:01,487
Don't take it personally?

359
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,924
You mean that my father
didn't consult me about this?

360
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:06,826
That's kind of personal, dad.

361
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,227
And on top of that what about Alex?

362
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,661
How could you do that to her?

363
00:22:10,084 --> 00:22:11,663
It was Alex's idea.

364
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,009
Hey, Skills.

365
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,610
Hey, Millie.

366
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:26,712
I need to ask you something.

367
00:22:26,795 --> 00:22:28,963
Is it about Marvin and Lauren?

368
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,608
Yeah.

369
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,040
You know about that?

370
00:22:32,123 --> 00:22:33,275
Yeah.

371
00:22:33,358 --> 00:22:35,759
And you're not upset about it?

372
00:22:36,327 --> 00:22:40,381
Of course I'm upset,
but I want Marvin to be happy.

373
00:22:40,464 --> 00:22:43,484
So, why'd you come back?

374
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:46,087
I just missed my life here.

375
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,389
It's hard starting over in a new place.

376
00:22:48,472 --> 00:22:50,840
It's hard starting over, period.

377
00:22:52,576 --> 00:22:54,495
Lauren was my girl.

378
00:22:54,578 --> 00:22:57,365
And Marvin was my guy,
but we took them for granted.

379
00:22:57,448 --> 00:23:00,150
I guess we made our beds,
and now we have to sleep in them.

380
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,100
* after all

381
00:23:55,562 --> 00:23:56,981
hello?

382
00:23:57,064 --> 00:23:58,682
Haley! Thank God! Where are you?

383
00:23:58,765 --> 00:24:00,551
Um, I'm at home.

384
00:24:00,634 --> 00:24:03,154
Home. Well, what happened?
We're waiting for you.

385
00:24:03,237 --> 00:24:05,356
What are you waiting for?

386
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:09,693
Um, your video shoot.
What is going on with you?

387
00:24:09,776 --> 00:24:11,462
Nothing. I just...

388
00:24:11,545 --> 00:24:12,897
It's just music.

389
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,365
Just music?

390
00:24:14,448 --> 00:24:16,867
Haley, we're spending 50,
000 dollars a day on this video,

391
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,904
and I am not shooting sock puppets
in front of a white sheet!

392
00:24:19,987 --> 00:24:21,472
So get your ass back here now!

393
00:24:21,555 --> 00:24:22,706
I got to go.

394
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:24,375
Haley, I'm serious.

395
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,052
Please tell me there's an emergency

396
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:28,179
or... or give me some reason
I can sell to the label

397
00:24:28,262 --> 00:24:30,281
as an excuse for why you're
not onstage right now.

398
00:24:30,364 --> 00:24:32,565
I'm making soup. Haley...

399
00:24:33,901 --> 00:24:35,001
Haley!

400
00:24:51,118 --> 00:24:52,903
They were in Katie's room.

401
00:24:52,986 --> 00:24:55,206
That's how I knew who you
were when you called.

402
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:57,408
I just told her that I
wouldn't represent her...

403
00:24:57,491 --> 00:24:59,343
It's not you.

404
00:24:59,426 --> 00:25:01,645
I also found her lithium in the garbage.

405
00:25:01,728 --> 00:25:04,530
Her behavior gets a little...

406
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,700
Unpredictable without it.

407
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,500
How unpredictable?

408
00:25:08,725 --> 00:25:12,227
Let's just say you should be careful.

409
00:25:39,656 --> 00:25:43,076
Mom, I finished my puzzle.
You want to come see?

410
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:44,678
Um, in a minute.

411
00:25:44,761 --> 00:25:47,981
Oh, are you making grandma's special soup?

412
00:25:48,064 --> 00:25:50,183
Oh, cool! Don't touch! Jamie!

413
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:52,619
I didn't mean to... look...
look what you did! Go to your room!

414
00:25:52,702 --> 00:25:54,870
But, mom! Just go to your room!

415
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:26,048
Haley...

416
00:26:27,851 --> 00:26:30,470
What happened?
They've been calling all day.

417
00:26:30,553 --> 00:26:32,372
You just... You just walked off the set?

418
00:26:32,455 --> 00:26:33,633
It's a big deal, babe.

419
00:26:35,859 --> 00:26:38,578
All right. Hey, hey. It's okay.

420
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:40,514
Just... I'll call them.

421
00:26:40,597 --> 00:26:43,316
You go upstairs and relax.
Let me clean this up.

422
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:44,618
You know, I'm okay.

423
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:46,969
I don't need any help.
I just want to be alone.

424
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,776
It's gonna be okay, Haley...

425
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,361
I want to be alone.

426
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,154
No comment.

427
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,409
Look, the thing is,

428
00:27:19,492 --> 00:27:21,265
we didn't want any of this to happen.

429
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,391
We...

430
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,348
Well, I wanted that to happen, obviously,

431
00:27:25,431 --> 00:27:26,898
but not so publicly.

432
00:27:30,803 --> 00:27:33,223
I don't understand why
you just didn't tell me.

433
00:27:33,306 --> 00:27:34,524
Should have.

434
00:27:34,607 --> 00:27:36,359
I feel like an idiot, mother.

435
00:27:36,442 --> 00:27:37,827
I yelled at Paul

436
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,729
because I thought he
stood you up for dinner.

437
00:27:39,812 --> 00:27:41,331
Why keep it a secret?

438
00:27:41,414 --> 00:27:44,015
Unless, of course, you're ashamed of it.

439
00:27:46,852 --> 00:27:48,671
Well, I've never been ashamed of it.

440
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:50,755
We're not ashamed of it.

441
00:27:52,858 --> 00:27:55,245
Oh, my God.

442
00:27:55,328 --> 00:27:56,646
Fine.

443
00:27:56,729 --> 00:27:59,282
If he makes you happy,
will be happy for you...

444
00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:03,553
So long as I do not have
to hear or see any more...

445
00:28:03,636 --> 00:28:05,103
Details.

446
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,670
Deal.

447
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:12,208
And you... no more... You know, outwork.

448
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:15,087
All work and no play

449
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,870
promise.

450
00:28:19,007 --> 00:28:20,893
You're really okay with this coming out?

451
00:28:20,976 --> 00:28:22,794
Yeah, cool by me.

452
00:28:22,877 --> 00:28:24,411
Let the world know.

453
00:28:27,482 --> 00:28:29,034
Clothes over bros.

454
00:28:29,477 --> 00:28:30,593
Yes.

455
00:28:31,748 --> 00:28:33,505
Hello, TMZ.

456
00:28:34,178 --> 00:28:38,318
Uh-huh. That was actually my mother,
Victoria Davis.

457
00:28:38,693 --> 00:28:39,845
Yes.

458
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,137
V-i-c-t-o-r-i-a.

459
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,648
Vocal track, take 1.

460
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,716
Hey, I have something of yours.

461
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:53,908
Thanks for letting it be
a part of my wardrobe.

462
00:29:53,991 --> 00:29:56,010
Every time I stepped onto set,
it reminded me

463
00:29:56,093 --> 00:29:57,645
that someone believed in me.

464
00:29:57,728 --> 00:30:01,149
And now that the film's wrapped,
well... thank you.

465
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:04,033
Well, you've come a long way
since I gave you this watch.

466
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:07,842
Which is why I don't understand

467
00:30:07,925 --> 00:30:10,406
how you would allow Paul
to release the sex tape.

468
00:30:12,543 --> 00:30:14,328
Hope you're not doing this for Josh.

469
00:30:14,411 --> 00:30:17,532
I didn't do it for Josh.

470
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,067
I did it for you and the movie.

471
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,136
You saved my life... Literally.

472
00:30:22,219 --> 00:30:24,320
It was the least I could do.

473
00:30:26,557 --> 00:30:29,325
I needed to let you know
that I believe in you, too.

474
00:30:35,032 --> 00:30:37,667
Hey, what happened, man?

475
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,733
You were almost finish with this thing.

476
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,500
That's not work.

477
00:30:48,067 --> 00:30:49,534
Thank you.

478
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:51,670
Is mom still mad at me?

479
00:30:54,307 --> 00:30:55,774
It's not you, buddy.

480
00:30:58,111 --> 00:31:00,497
Your mother really loves you.

481
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,183
She always will. Promise.

482
00:31:05,985 --> 00:31:08,387
Let's put this thing back together, huh?

483
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:52,848
Um...

484
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,868
It's just missing one thing.

485
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:24,585
I'll be right with you.
Watch the glass, please.

486
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:37,683
Have an accident?

487
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:39,200
Can I help you?

488
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:42,321
I'm here for Clay.

489
00:32:42,404 --> 00:32:44,890
I mean, my photo of Clay.

490
00:32:44,973 --> 00:32:46,892
I know I said you could send it to me,

491
00:32:46,975 --> 00:32:49,829
but I decided that I want him now.

492
00:32:49,912 --> 00:32:52,098
Well, that's unfortunate
because that print's

493
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:54,200
already been shipped,
per your instructions.

494
00:32:54,283 --> 00:32:56,035
Could take weeks.

495
00:32:56,118 --> 00:32:58,886
So I guess you're gonna have to
get used to being without him.

496
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,124
Excuse me.

497
00:33:12,301 --> 00:33:15,021
Clay, she's here.

498
00:33:15,104 --> 00:33:16,222
Katie?

499
00:33:16,305 --> 00:33:17,939
All right, Quinn, listen to me.

500
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,800
I talked to her roommate,
Katie's unstable.

501
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,751
Yeah, you're damn right. She's unstable.

502
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,503
She's standing in my gallery
telling me that she wants you.

503
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,556
She's about to see how unstable I can be.

504
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:29,058
Quinn, I'm being serious.

505
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:32,494
Just be careful and get the
hell out of there, okay? Please.

506
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,062
Okay.

507
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,197
Promise me.

508
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,598
Yeah, I promise.

509
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,693
Um, I'll just tell her I'm
gonna close up and head home.

510
00:33:38,776 --> 00:33:39,801
Okay.

511
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:42,186
And just call me as soon
as you get out of there.

512
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,974
And, Quinn... I love you.

513
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:48,592
I love you, too.

514
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,097
I feel sorry for you.

515
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:56,485
Can't you see how sad he is?

516
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:59,488
Stop pretending like you
know him and leave us alone.

517
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:01,990
That's cute. You said "us."

518
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,993
But it was obvious he never
even told you about me.

519
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:08,297
You need to go now.

520
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,300
I see the way he looks at you.

521
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,035
But you don't know the way he looked at me

522
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:14,385
the first time he saw me.

523
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,489
He'll never look at you like that.

524
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,624
You'll never be Sara.

525
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,193
Neither will you.

526
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,000
We'll see about that.

527
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:02,961
I'm sorry I hurt you.

528
00:35:03,044 --> 00:35:04,945
It's part of the game, bro.

529
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:08,348
You know what I mean.

530
00:35:10,585 --> 00:35:12,671
You there?

531
00:35:12,754 --> 00:35:14,272
Could we just play for a while?

532
00:35:14,553 --> 00:35:15,991
Sure.

533
00:35:38,383 --> 00:35:39,873
I miss her.

534
00:35:41,082 --> 00:35:42,515
I know.

535
00:35:45,286 --> 00:35:48,540
Maybe you should focus
on your music, Haley.

536
00:35:48,623 --> 00:35:52,210
It will see you through.

537
00:35:52,293 --> 00:35:54,995
What if it doesn't?

538
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:00,033
I'll be here.

539
00:36:07,408 --> 00:36:10,417
What's the difference between
a whore and Alex Dupre?

540
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,100
The one is payed for sex and the
another do it for free.

541
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,900
And another is a turns out
was it for Davis

542
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,426
vacationing down under...
It was her mom.

543
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,143
I guess cougars do live
in Australia.

544
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,631
Okay, here's the deal.

545
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:26,834
I'm tired of the entire
world thinking I'm a slut.

546
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:28,169
Thinking?

547
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,371
So at this moment,

548
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:34,375
you and I are officially together.

549
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:37,478
What are you talking about? The sex tape.

550
00:36:37,561 --> 00:36:40,221
I don't look as bad as if I
made it with my boyfriend...

551
00:36:40,304 --> 00:36:41,544
Who loves me

552
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,668
you're welcome.

553
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,765
Wow. You look nice.

554
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:00,368
Well, I was gonna get
dressed for a wrap party,

555
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:02,070
but now I don't have to.

556
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:04,572
To my boyfriend, Julian Baker

557
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:08,109
who survived a day of sex,
lies, and videotapes.

558
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:09,601
Nice.

559
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:11,871
Mm.

560
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,764
I almost forgot.
That came in the mail for you.

561
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,788
"You and a guest have
been cordially invited

562
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,691
"to attend the official unwrap party

563
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:26,176
for 'seven dreams 'til Tuesday.'"

564
00:37:31,879 --> 00:37:35,500
Brooke Davis caught in a
sex act with her boy-toy.

565
00:37:48,355 --> 00:37:50,541
When I'm upset, I bake.

566
00:37:50,624 --> 00:37:52,843
And I was really upset.

567
00:37:53,459 --> 00:37:54,724
Thanks.

568
00:37:55,862 --> 00:37:58,549
Look, I'm sorry.

569
00:37:58,632 --> 00:38:00,784
I never meant to come between you guys.

570
00:38:00,867 --> 00:38:03,654
I don't know how to handle
all of this, Lauren.

571
00:38:03,737 --> 00:38:06,056
I don't, either.

572
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:08,058
I just know I wanted to see you.

573
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:09,293
I did, too.

574
00:38:09,376 --> 00:38:10,695
But...

575
00:38:12,245 --> 00:38:14,747
I can't do this to my friend.

576
00:38:17,884 --> 00:38:19,952
I'm sorry.

577
00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:35,969
Ancient architecture... *

578
00:39:36,052 --> 00:39:38,620
she's not gonna go away.

579
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,700
And even what I said thing
this is just the beginning.

580
00:39:48,197 --> 00:39:51,317
Priest on TV: And do you,
Sara take this man, Clay Evans,

581
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,919
to be your lawfully wedded husband,

582
00:39:53,002 --> 00:39:55,188
from this day forward,

583
00:39:55,271 --> 00:39:57,390
for better or for worse,

584
00:39:57,473 --> 00:39:59,592
to have and to hold,

585
00:39:59,675 --> 00:40:01,995
to love and to cherish

586
00:40:02,078 --> 00:40:04,597
until death do you part?

587
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,381
I do. I do.

588
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,900
Haley!

589
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:15,895
Move!

590
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,612
Are you okay?

591
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:35,278
Haley!

592
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,002
What happened?

593
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,300
I'm gonna go call my mum.

594
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
