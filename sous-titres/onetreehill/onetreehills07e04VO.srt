1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,401
Previously in "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:01,436 --> 00:00:02,504
Millie was right.

3
00:00:02,539 --> 00:00:05,848
Alex Dupre is the perfect choice
to be the face of the new campaign.

4
00:00:05,883 --> 00:00:08,019
You do know that's Brooke's boyfriend, right?

5
00:00:08,054 --> 00:00:10,900
- She dates a PA?
- He's not a PA, he is a producer.

6
00:00:11,872 --> 00:00:13,500
I know what you're thinking.

7
00:00:13,535 --> 00:00:15,295
But I know a good script when I read it.

8
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,353
Ok. I'll take a look.

9
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,299
Quinn, what happened
between you and David?

10
00:00:20,737 --> 00:00:23,293
He used to see the world exactly the way I saw it.

11
00:00:23,714 --> 00:00:25,149
He just doesn't anymore.

12
00:00:25,343 --> 00:00:27,129
You're gonna have to talk to me sometime.

13
00:00:27,164 --> 00:00:29,624
There's a girl who's threatening to
file a paternity suit against me,

14
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:32,198
unless I pay her a couple hundred
thousands dollars to keep her quiet.

15
00:00:32,427 --> 00:00:35,105
- What are you gonna do about it?
- I don't know.

16
00:00:35,438 --> 00:00:37,066
What are you gonna do about it?

17
00:00:37,828 --> 00:00:38,844
Nothing.

18
00:00:39,186 --> 00:00:41,882
The amount we're willing to pay to make this go away.

19
00:00:42,277 --> 00:00:43,292
It's empty.

20
00:00:43,327 --> 00:00:47,031
It's empty because you're a lying bitch
and we're not paying you a dime.

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,614
One Tree Hill - Season 7 Episode 4
Believe Me, I'm Lying

22
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,170
You missed another workout.

23
00:00:59,652 --> 00:01:01,070
It's four in a row.

24
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:03,936
Should I be worried?

25
00:01:04,818 --> 00:01:06,218
I haven't been in the mood.

26
00:01:06,253 --> 00:01:08,871
Look, I get that, but you can't
lose sight of what's in the line.

27
00:01:09,248 --> 00:01:11,869
Right now, your job is to stay in shape.

28
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:15,168
Am I gonna have a job, this year?

29
00:01:16,384 --> 00:01:19,539
- What's going on with my contract, Clay?
- I'm working on it.

30
00:01:19,574 --> 00:01:23,477
- Should I be worried?
- We're gonna get it done. I promise you that.

31
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:27,116
Why haven't we heard anything?

32
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:29,928
I told you, man, things are in process.

33
00:01:29,963 --> 00:01:31,823
I'm not talking about my deal.

34
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,652
This girl, Renee...

35
00:01:34,013 --> 00:01:36,838
It's been three days since we told her
we won't gonna pay her anything.

36
00:01:37,714 --> 00:01:39,363
You think she decided to back off?

37
00:01:39,398 --> 00:01:40,652
I doubt it.

38
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:42,992
Don't come out.

39
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,065
And we're prepared for that.

40
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,085
But until then, you can't just sit around
holding your breath until it happens.

41
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:52,003
Alright? I need you to get your
head back in the game, Nate.

42
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:57,116
Alright?

43
00:01:58,982 --> 00:02:00,199
Ok.

44
00:02:00,992 --> 00:02:02,229
Let's go.

45
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:09,900
Dude, good find! I love this stuff.

46
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:13,487
Here's my official cereal selecter. Say that 3 times fast.

47
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:15,920
Cereal Selecter. Cereal Selecter. Cereal Selecter.

48
00:02:15,955 --> 00:02:16,941
Nice.

49
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:19,806
- This has too much sugar. Keep working.
- I knew it.

50
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:22,168
Too much sugar?

51
00:02:22,203 --> 00:02:25,281
Ok, I've seen you eat 5 balls
of Count Chocula in one sitting.

52
00:02:25,316 --> 00:02:28,291
That was on a dare from Taylor, and before I became a mom.

53
00:02:28,326 --> 00:02:30,322
You'll see, you're gonna have kids some day.

54
00:02:30,357 --> 00:02:32,436
Dude, hand over that crystal ball.

55
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:34,415
I have a few questions for it.

56
00:02:34,673 --> 00:02:36,704
You know, I have a question too.

57
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,982
What happened with you and
David at Tric? It's been a few days.

58
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:44,680
He wants me to come home and I told him
I need more time to figure things out.

59
00:02:47,415 --> 00:02:48,982
Now we're talking.

60
00:02:49,017 --> 00:02:51,611
Too healthy. Keep looking. It's out there.

61
00:02:54,137 --> 00:02:57,766
For your information, these cereals
have everything you need.

62
00:02:58,075 --> 00:03:00,920
That's the thing, I might have everything that I need

63
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:03,398
that doesn't mean that's everything that I want.

64
00:03:11,662 --> 00:03:13,209
What is that smell?

65
00:03:13,446 --> 00:03:15,157
That would be sandalwood.

66
00:03:15,192 --> 00:03:17,240
Seriously, with the incense?

67
00:03:17,275 --> 00:03:18,813
It's relaxing.

68
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:20,910
It's giving me a headache.

69
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:24,497
Sorry. Are you nervous about your big day?

70
00:03:24,532 --> 00:03:27,850
If you're referring to the fashion show that we've
poured too much time and money into,

71
00:03:27,885 --> 00:03:28,956
then, yeah.

72
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,592
I'm not gonna lie, I'm nervous about it.

73
00:03:32,147 --> 00:03:35,054
Well, you shouldn't be. You're Brooke Davis.

74
00:03:35,271 --> 00:03:38,513
You're starting to sound like
Victoria, and that's weird for me.

75
00:03:41,168 --> 00:03:42,689
Do you have a new script?

76
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:46,013
Oh, that's the script Alex gave me the other
night. I was just writing down some ideas.

77
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,405
- I thought you didn't like it.
- I don't.

78
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,302
But the story's pretty good. There might be something there.

79
00:03:51,337 --> 00:03:54,137
Well, you don't have to do
this for me. I don't even like Alex.

80
00:03:54,456 --> 00:03:56,508
Oh, I'm not doing it as a favor.

81
00:03:56,543 --> 00:03:58,721
I know a good idea when I see one.

82
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:03,858
Besides, people love a comeback story, and Alex
is a good actress when she finds the right role.

83
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:06,013
So, it's worth a look.

84
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:07,446
Ok.

85
00:04:11,374 --> 00:04:12,611
I'll see you later.

86
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:17,013
Hey, Brooke Davis...

87
00:04:18,363 --> 00:04:20,054
you look beautiful today.

88
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,579
Please be awake, please be awake.

89
00:04:35,135 --> 00:04:36,393
Alex!

90
00:04:36,774 --> 00:04:38,680
- You're... ready.

91
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,288
We have a job to do, don't we?

92
00:04:40,475 --> 00:04:41,609
Yes, we do.

93
00:04:41,644 --> 00:04:44,104
It's called "being professional"
which I'm kinda known for it.

94
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:47,084
Used to be. Oh, my God,
you look hot by the way.

95
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:50,022
Now tell me I look hot too bitch, because I do.

96
00:04:50,383 --> 00:04:53,393
- You look hot too, bitch.
- Thanks.

97
00:05:03,238 --> 00:05:04,414
Ok, right.

98
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:07,269
Even though it's incredibly riventing
watching you lift weights,

99
00:05:07,304 --> 00:05:09,341
I think I'm gonna head out.

100
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,444
What time do you go to the fashion show tonight?

101
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:15,156
I don't know. Whatever. You going?

102
00:05:15,908 --> 00:05:19,606
Do I really want to watch a group
of hot models parade on stage?

103
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:21,513
Getting early, buddy.

104
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:24,465
You're doing good, Nate.
It's about 20?

105
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,579
I'm at 27.

106
00:05:25,614 --> 00:05:28,857
You know, you don't bring the bar on your
chest every time, we don't count those.

107
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:31,756
I'm watching you.

108
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,393
Hello?

109
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:38,321
Ok.

110
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:41,080
Yeah, we knew there was a chance of that.

111
00:05:41,115 --> 00:05:42,207
Thank you.

112
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,549
I don't care what you say. That was 30. I'm done.

113
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,192
The story burn out, Nate.

114
00:05:54,414 --> 00:05:55,960
It's out there.

115
00:05:57,244 --> 00:05:58,460
Where?

116
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:01,223
What you got there, little man?

117
00:06:02,883 --> 00:06:04,615
What's a love child?

118
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,613
I bought every copy I could find.

119
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,654
I'm sorry, Hales.

120
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,633
- You don't have to keep apologize.
- Yes, I do.

121
00:06:33,582 --> 00:06:37,355
I'm responsible for this family and it
kills me that you have to go through this.

122
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:40,345
We are going through this, Nathan, together.

123
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,392
We knew this was gonna happen. We made a choice

124
00:06:43,427 --> 00:06:46,028
and I still think it was the right thing to do.

125
00:06:48,984 --> 00:06:50,468
Has Jamie seen this?

126
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:52,829
He was the one that found it.

127
00:06:53,128 --> 00:06:56,716
He's just such a good boy. He doesn't understand
why somebody would lie like this.

128
00:06:58,272 --> 00:06:59,571
Is he home?

129
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,505
No, he went to the park with Quinn.

130
00:07:03,581 --> 00:07:06,717
I thought it'd be good for him to spend
some time with his friends right now.

131
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:11,421
"The first time we were together, Nathan
couldn't get enough, and neither could I."

132
00:07:11,887 --> 00:07:15,513
- Naughty naughty!
- Shut up, Chuck, it's not true.

133
00:07:15,707 --> 00:07:19,608
Yeah, right. My mom says they don't put
stuff in these magazines unless it's true.

134
00:07:19,735 --> 00:07:21,841
- Your dad's hosed.
- He is not.

135
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:23,532
Yeah.

136
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,990
I think I should be allowed enough
time to figure out exactly what I want.

137
00:07:28,776 --> 00:07:31,432
- I mean, don't I deserve that?
- Yeah.

138
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:36,678
But David doesn't see it that way,
he just wants to work it out.

139
00:07:37,505 --> 00:07:40,857
What if I don't want to work it out? What if I can't?

140
00:07:41,413 --> 00:07:42,813
Then what?

141
00:07:43,261 --> 00:07:44,418
Boys...

142
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,702
Refresh my memory.

143
00:07:54,902 --> 00:07:57,521
Did I not asked you to look into
the Nathan Scott situation

144
00:07:57,522 --> 00:07:59,194
and find out if there was a story?

145
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:00,995
I did, but there wasn't.

146
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,238
The why does the National Informer have one?

147
00:08:04,787 --> 00:08:07,680
The National Informer? Are you being serious?

148
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:11,605
Oh oh, look at this: alien babies on the rise.

149
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:14,828
They scooped us on that one too,
maybe you should hire them.

150
00:08:15,124 --> 00:08:16,252
Maybe I will.

151
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:18,299
Come on, Charlie, this isn't news.

152
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,995
Right now it's nothing but a
rumor in some low-rent tabloid.

153
00:08:20,996 --> 00:08:24,466
But as soon as we report on that,
we validate it. It becomes news.

154
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:27,486
It's not fair and it's not what I do.

155
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:30,695
What you do is what I tell you to do.

156
00:08:30,696 --> 00:08:33,885
Or else you can go drag the ratings
down at someone else's station.

157
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:45,791
Quinn did a really great job with
these, Alex looks beautiful.

158
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,512
Yeah, now all we have to do is pick one.

159
00:08:47,513 --> 00:08:49,166
The winner goes in tonight gift bag.

160
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,679
So which one's the winner?

161
00:08:51,093 --> 00:08:53,339
- I was kind of hoping you'd pick.
- Millie...

162
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,609
this is your decision and I want you to make it.

163
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,781
You're good at it.

164
00:08:56,989 --> 00:08:59,955
Ok. That's go... this one.

165
00:09:00,698 --> 00:09:01,899
Perfect.

166
00:09:03,053 --> 00:09:07,845
Ok. Millie, even though you are completely
in charge of tonight's fashion show

167
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:10,885
I decided to bring in a little experience just to help

168
00:09:10,886 --> 00:09:12,786
everything runs smoothly.

169
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:15,165
- Please don't freak out.
- Please don't tell me you invited...

170
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,479
Well, well.

171
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,126
Hi boss.

172
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:22,173
These are lovely.

173
00:09:22,848 --> 00:09:24,301
Here's your winner.

174
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,310
I already picked this one.

175
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:29,441
I guess it will have to do then.

176
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:40,556
She's quite percy you know.
Woman your husband slept with.

177
00:09:40,557 --> 00:09:43,958
- At least the baby will be adorable.
- Why would you say something like that?

178
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:48,059
What? The National Informer isn't
a reliable source of information?

179
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:49,695
My mistake.

180
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,209
You got time for a brother-in-law?

181
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,507
David, hi!

182
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:03,037
- Oh, it's good to see you.
- It's good to see you too.

183
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:05,595
- It's crazy out there.
- Yeah, we're having a fashion show tonight.

184
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:07,898
And the Noisettes are playing, so, it should be fun.

185
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,549
Maybe I'll stop by.

186
00:10:09,798 --> 00:10:11,598
You know, Quinn's gonna be here.

187
00:10:12,156 --> 00:10:13,853
Does that might ?????? to stay away?

188
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:16,235
No, no, that's not what I meant.

189
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:20,188
I would love for you to come, I just feel like
it might be a little awkward right now.

190
00:10:22,258 --> 00:10:24,795
Could you give her a message from me?

191
00:10:25,195 --> 00:10:26,885
Just tell her I miss her,

192
00:10:26,886 --> 00:10:28,036
and that I love her.

193
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:32,241
If she ever wants to talk to me I'll be
right here, I'm not going anywhere.

194
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,620
- It was good to see you.
- To see you too.

195
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:39,578
Okay.

196
00:10:40,127 --> 00:10:41,329
Bye.

197
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:46,611
Millie.

198
00:10:46,757 --> 00:10:49,007
This... just came for you.

199
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:51,174
Hi, Mrs. Davis. How are you?

200
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,890
I'm sorry. Have we met?

201
00:10:54,065 --> 00:10:55,465
Yeah, many times.

202
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,475
I used to date your daughter.

203
00:10:57,878 --> 00:11:00,392
Every time that I said "hello",
you asked me if we'd met.

204
00:11:00,978 --> 00:11:02,728
Well, until next time then.

205
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:12,423
"To Millie: I'm sorry I can't be there for your
big night but I can't wait to celebrate.

206
00:11:12,424 --> 00:11:14,664
I'm proud of you. Love, Marvin. "

207
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:15,951
Sweet.

208
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:19,367
You know where this would
look perfect? In your car.

209
00:11:20,485 --> 00:11:22,791
Nice flowers! Who's the old lady?

210
00:11:23,155 --> 00:11:25,305
The old lady is Brooke's mother.

211
00:11:25,582 --> 00:11:27,733
Victoria, this is Alex Dupre.

212
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:31,278
She's the star of tonight
show. Alex, Victoria Davis.

213
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:34,198
So you're the former actress we're overpaying.

214
00:11:34,347 --> 00:11:36,584
Oh wait, Millie told me all about you.

215
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,624
How you were this evil bitch
who used to run everything here,

216
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,377
- but now you're just an evil bitch.
- I didn't say that.

217
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:43,897
In those words.

218
00:11:44,276 --> 00:11:47,118
Well, I'll let you get back to not making movies.

219
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:50,599
You are fun.

220
00:11:53,118 --> 00:11:55,776
Hey, Haley Bob. Have you seen these?

221
00:11:55,777 --> 00:11:58,194
Yeah, they are gorgeous.

222
00:11:58,521 --> 00:12:01,732
I could not help noticing that you
signed yourself as Quinn James.

223
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,808
Yeah.

224
00:12:04,113 --> 00:12:05,388
I don't know.

225
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:08,667
I thought it was a good idea.
You know, kinda like a fresh start.

226
00:12:09,126 --> 00:12:10,426
Fresh start?

227
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:12,975
You know what I mean.

228
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:16,039
You need to tell David how you feel, Quinn.

229
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:19,686
He came by here today and he wanted
me to tell you that he loves you

230
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:21,480
and he misses you,

231
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:24,804
and he'll wait for you. And he meant every word of it.

232
00:12:25,768 --> 00:12:29,373
All I wanted more than anything was to
tell him that you felt the same way.

233
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:31,769
Yeah, but that's not your place, is it?

234
00:12:32,095 --> 00:12:34,831
No, it's not. It's yours.

235
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:39,991
Just tell him the truth, Quinn. He's still your
husband, even if you don't love him anymore.

236
00:12:40,517 --> 00:12:43,265
If you owe him anything at all, it's truth.

237
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:50,341
Jamie Scott, you're late.

238
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:51,852
I am?

239
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:54,063
Aren't you here to help me
pass out these gift bags?

240
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,860
- Sure. What do I do?
- Put one of those on every chair.

241
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:03,442
Just... put my son to work?

242
00:13:03,443 --> 00:13:06,580
Absolutely. Clothes Over Bros
has a long history for child labor.

243
00:13:07,122 --> 00:13:09,051
I'm just kidding. I thought...

244
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:11,316
it might help take his mind off things.

245
00:13:11,317 --> 00:13:13,526
- You read the National Informer.
- No.

246
00:13:13,673 --> 00:13:15,008
But I heard about it.

247
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:16,521
I only read those things when I'm in them

248
00:13:16,522 --> 00:13:19,874
'cause I'm still waiting for that story
to come out about and Johnny Depp.

249
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Nice.

250
00:13:21,321 --> 00:13:24,621
Seriously, Nate, I've been on
the tabloids a thousand times,

251
00:13:24,622 --> 00:13:27,544
and it's never been anything but rumors and lies.

252
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:28,968
Look...

253
00:13:29,235 --> 00:13:31,587
all you can do is weather the storm

254
00:13:31,588 --> 00:13:34,005
don't feed the flame and make it worse.

255
00:13:34,006 --> 00:13:36,216
And eventually they'll move on to somebody else.

256
00:13:36,624 --> 00:13:38,124
I just have one question.

257
00:13:38,827 --> 00:13:41,037
How do you explain that to a seven-year-old?

258
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:58,506
Quinn told me the guys were
teasing you this morning.

259
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:00,429
Want to talk about it?

260
00:14:01,153 --> 00:14:03,604
Chuck said that I was gonna
have a brother or a sister.

261
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:10,026
I promise you if you ever do
have a little brothers or sister,

262
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:11,641
it would be from your mom and me.

263
00:14:13,381 --> 00:14:14,829
Why is she lying?

264
00:14:15,036 --> 00:14:18,454
Cause sometimes bad people forget
the difference between right and wrong.

265
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:21,533
And these people, sometimes...

266
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:23,899
they like to take advantage of good people...

267
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:24,932
like us.

268
00:14:26,613 --> 00:14:28,341
Do you ever forget?

269
00:14:28,515 --> 00:14:29,566
No.

270
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:30,843
And you know why?

271
00:14:30,947 --> 00:14:33,801
'Cause every time I'm not so
sure I'm doing the right thing,

272
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:36,346
I take a look at this picture of you and your mom,

273
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:39,801
and it reminds me of everything that's important to me.

274
00:14:40,665 --> 00:14:42,900
And it always helps me do the right thing.

275
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:45,924
Ok?

276
00:14:55,597 --> 00:14:57,113
I need you for about 10 minutes.

277
00:14:57,123 --> 00:14:59,249
There's a reporter here from
Visual Lyrics Magazine

278
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:01,625
and she wants to ask you a few
questions about Red Bedroom.

279
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:05,879
I'm not really up for an interview
today, Miranda, okay?

280
00:15:06,315 --> 00:15:08,071
No, it's not okay.

281
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,768
This label needs is starving for some good
press, and it's exactly how you get it.

282
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,227
So if that means to take a
few minutes to kiss it at last...

283
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:17,128
you get up and do it.

284
00:15:18,637 --> 00:15:21,778
The truth is, this reporter has influence

285
00:15:21,936 --> 00:15:24,270
and we don't want her on our bad side, okay?

286
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,210
Ten minutes.

287
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,692
Vicki.

288
00:15:31,891 --> 00:15:34,346
Brooke didn't tell me you
were coming in for the show.

289
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:38,115
Consider me Millicent training wheels,
and don't ever call me Vicki again.

290
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,177
Sorry. I thought we were bonding.

291
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:42,679
You thought wrong.

292
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:45,144
Tell me... how's your father?

293
00:15:45,247 --> 00:15:46,862
- It's Paul, right?
- Yeah.

294
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:48,815
Has he taken a lover recently?

295
00:15:49,627 --> 00:15:51,177
What just happened?

296
00:15:51,362 --> 00:15:53,327
Sorry. I thought we were bonding.

297
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,008
You thought wrong.

298
00:15:56,829 --> 00:15:58,951
You know, my daughter seems so happy lately.

299
00:15:58,961 --> 00:16:01,596
In fact, she seems happier that I've ever seen her.

300
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:04,548
I'm assuming I owe that to you.

301
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:06,754
Are you starting to approve of me?

302
00:16:06,895 --> 00:16:08,135
Don't be silly.

303
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:09,928
She could do so much better.

304
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,886
Good bye, Julian.

305
00:16:13,688 --> 00:16:15,538
Say hello to Paul for me.

306
00:16:15,857 --> 00:16:18,810
You tell him if he's ever in search
of a lover, to give me a call.

307
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:22,792
Please stop saying "lover".

308
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,590
Everyone knows about Mia Catalano.

309
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:27,440
What about Haley James Scott?

310
00:16:28,106 --> 00:16:30,138
When does your next album come out, Haley?

311
00:16:30,745 --> 00:16:33,327
We've been working hard so, hopefully soon.

312
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:35,561
Maybe I'll send you some tracks see if you like them.

313
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:36,756
I'd like that.

314
00:16:36,766 --> 00:16:38,810
Now, let's talk about your
reaction when you found out

315
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,641
your husband not only had an affair

316
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:42,887
but has got another woman pregnant .

317
00:16:42,897 --> 00:16:44,496
Sorry, Angela. Time's up.

318
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:46,833
You promised me 10 minutes,
Miranda. It's only been 5.

319
00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:50,037
Well, you forfeited the other 5 when
you asked that stupid question.

320
00:16:50,047 --> 00:16:52,343
- The question was relevant.
- No, it was personnal.

321
00:16:52,353 --> 00:16:54,307
Now, if you really wanna get personnal,

322
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:56,429
we can talk about that time
in the Hamptons three years ago,

323
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:58,280
when you got drunk and soiled yourself.

324
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,617
Now, that was a messy situation.

325
00:17:01,945 --> 00:17:04,030
Look, that never happened.
You just made that up.

326
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,147
Oh, then I'm sure you're sympathetic to Haley's situation...

327
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:10,023
since her husband's affair was also made up.

328
00:17:12,425 --> 00:17:13,425
Off you go.

329
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,711
We'll look forward to reading your column.

330
00:17:26,281 --> 00:17:27,755
What if she hates us?

331
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,213
Who reads "Reviews" anyway?

332
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:40,196
Excuse me.

333
00:17:40,438 --> 00:17:42,728
Those waters are for the models, not the help.

334
00:17:42,738 --> 00:17:43,833
Oh, no, I'm not...

335
00:17:43,843 --> 00:17:46,312
Supposed to be back here. I know, sweetie.

336
00:17:46,781 --> 00:17:50,131
You see this, is where the pretty people play.

337
00:17:51,163 --> 00:17:52,750
You don't qualify.

338
00:17:58,436 --> 00:17:59,957
Makenna Gage, right?

339
00:18:00,304 --> 00:18:02,933
Oh, my gosh, you're so pretty in person.

340
00:18:03,281 --> 00:18:05,450
All the other girls are such skanks.

341
00:18:05,824 --> 00:18:08,196
- I'm Alex, by the way.
- I know who you are.

342
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,724
I love your movies.

343
00:18:09,911 --> 00:18:13,078
I'm actually doing some acting down
too, but I still model on the side.

344
00:18:13,088 --> 00:18:15,044
Oh, I knew that we had
something in common.

345
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:17,695
You remember that movie you
did about the double agent?

346
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:20,055
I auditioned for your part.

347
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,071
Well, they told me I was too hot.

348
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:23,893
No offense.

349
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:26,408
Oh, my God.

350
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:29,202
We should totally do a movie together.

351
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:31,813
Totally. We would have so much fun.

352
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:35,027
You party, right?

353
00:18:35,296 --> 00:18:38,541
Of course you do. You have to try
these, they're so kick-ass.

354
00:18:38,745 --> 00:18:41,824
I usually take three, but you
should probably only take two.

355
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:44,101
Give me four.

356
00:18:58,829 --> 00:19:00,026
Hi, David.

357
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:01,951
Quinn.

358
00:19:06,787 --> 00:19:08,026
It's good to see you.

359
00:19:08,036 --> 00:19:09,036
You too.

360
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:18,322
This reminds me of this park where we first met.

361
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,312
You know, I almost proposed you there.

362
00:19:22,322 --> 00:19:24,680
Really? You never told me that.

363
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:27,577
I had the ring. It was a bveautiful night.

364
00:19:28,753 --> 00:19:31,815
You were a little drunk, so I've been
asking myself the chances to ask.

365
00:19:34,736 --> 00:19:36,070
So what happened?

366
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,627
I decided to wait for a better moment.

367
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:43,383
Well, that's us isn't it?

368
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,787
Always waiting for something.

369
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:48,918
That's not true.

370
00:19:49,613 --> 00:19:51,632
Remember that job in San Francisco?

371
00:19:52,782 --> 00:19:55,723
You didn't take it because you
felt something better might come.

372
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:56,782
And it did.

373
00:19:57,242 --> 00:19:58,242
I know it did.

374
00:19:58,778 --> 00:20:00,478
And you were right to wait.

375
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,279
But that was two years of our lives we could have
been experiencing something exciting and new, and...

376
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:09,946
instead we just put our lives on hold.

377
00:20:10,693 --> 00:20:12,242
I didn't realize you felt that way.

378
00:20:13,585 --> 00:20:15,218
I didn't at the time.

379
00:20:15,383 --> 00:20:18,941
You know, we made that decision together,
and I was fine with that decision then.

380
00:20:20,748 --> 00:20:23,396
The person I am today wouldn't
have waited those two years.

381
00:20:23,406 --> 00:20:24,406
Ok.

382
00:20:25,331 --> 00:20:27,294
I understand that, but I can change too.

383
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,880
I can be whoever you want me to be.

384
00:20:32,652 --> 00:20:35,369
I won't wait you change for me.

385
00:20:35,448 --> 00:20:36,688
It's not fair.

386
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:40,195
I want you to be you because,
you're a wonderful person.

387
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:47,481
So is this the part you tell me you love
me, but you're not in love with me?

388
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,280
So that's it?

389
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:58,918
There's nothing I can do to save our marriage?

390
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:03,008
I'm sorry, David.

391
00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:06,932
I think we should get a divorce.

392
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,209
That is the sexy group. You girls look amazing.

393
00:21:29,229 --> 00:21:33,097
And when you're out there,  don't worry, they
will be staring at you, they will be staring at me.

394
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:34,399
Wait.

395
00:21:35,352 --> 00:21:37,502
Where is the red cocktail dress?

396
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:40,633
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... 9!

397
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,933
- Why am I counting nine?
- Because there's nine of us.

398
00:21:44,758 --> 00:21:46,781
Where is Makenna?

399
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,274
Someobody wake her up.

400
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:54,539
Good luck, I saw her swallow a
hand full of pills. She's such a cliche.

401
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:57,496
Victoria, please, tell me you can fix this.

402
00:21:58,024 --> 00:22:01,867
This is Millie's show, remember?
I'm sure she has a backup plan.

403
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,430
Yes, I do.

404
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,685
We double up one model. The first girl on stage

405
00:22:05,705 --> 00:22:07,816
changes and goes out in the final piece.

406
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:08,932
Ok.

407
00:22:09,242 --> 00:22:11,805
Okay, that works... what about the final work?

408
00:22:11,825 --> 00:22:14,930
- We loose one piece from the collection.
- That's unacceptable.

409
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,492
- Millie can handle it.
- Well, clearly she can't.

410
00:22:17,512 --> 00:22:20,380
No, I mean Millie can do it,
she can take Makenna's place.

411
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:22,477
Me? I'm not a model.

412
00:22:22,497 --> 00:22:24,180
She's definitely not a model.

413
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,453
Neither am I, but I'm still going out there.

414
00:22:26,473 --> 00:22:31,113
She's gorgeous, she's got better legs than Makenna
and let's face it, and she's your only option.

415
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:34,504
Unless, of course, you want to
go out there with your walker.

416
00:22:34,524 --> 00:22:36,164
Millie, strip down.

417
00:22:36,336 --> 00:22:38,312
Chop chop.

418
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:50,507
Chase, I thought you managed this place now.

419
00:22:50,527 --> 00:22:53,426
Mostly. But, I kinda miss being back here.

420
00:22:53,446 --> 00:22:58,078
I invented a new drink, you should
try. It's called "the brain hemorrhage".

421
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,617
You know there's already a drink
called the brain hemorrhage, right?

422
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:04,852
I'm sorry, man. I'm sure yours is much better.

423
00:23:04,872 --> 00:23:06,972
Damn it! I'll get you a beer.

424
00:23:06,992 --> 00:23:08,800
Ok.

425
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,336
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

426
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:12,584
Listen, the press are gonna be here
later, so I want you to practise

427
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:14,484
two very important words...

428
00:23:14,742 --> 00:23:17,297
- "No comment".
- What if I do make a comment?

429
00:23:17,492 --> 00:23:20,047
Maybe just... tell my side of things?

430
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:23,610
I'd be careful about that, it's just
a game you don't wanna play.

431
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,633
So, what do you think? It's not bad, eh?

432
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:32,639
It's delicious, it should be illegal.

433
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:37,399
This is the worst drink I ever had.

434
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:40,531
- Brain hemorrhage?
- Yeah, good call on the beer.

435
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,780
How are those nerves holding up?

436
00:23:47,102 --> 00:23:50,711
I'm about to be judged by fashion critics
who had to fly to North Carolina

437
00:23:50,867 --> 00:23:53,167
and love to witness failure.

438
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:57,092
Well, then I guess they're gonna
be disappointed tonight.

439
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:00,667
I brought you something that's
gonna relieve all your stress.

440
00:24:00,687 --> 00:24:02,399
You got me a present?

441
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,102
Sandalwood.

442
00:24:06,858 --> 00:24:09,187
It must have broken in half on the way over here.

443
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:13,836
Oh well, I guess this will have to do.

444
00:24:25,426 --> 00:24:26,631
You still nervous?

445
00:24:26,912 --> 00:24:28,209
For what?

446
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:29,769
Where am I?

447
00:24:36,097 --> 00:24:38,671
I want to thank you all
for coming here tonight.

448
00:24:38,691 --> 00:24:41,207
Those of you who traveled
down here to Tree Hill.

449
00:24:41,227 --> 00:24:44,379
I know we're not in New
York but this is my home

450
00:24:44,535 --> 00:24:49,222
and this is the place that inspired the line,
so I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.

451
00:24:51,465 --> 00:24:54,863
Now, to kick us off, we are thrilled to bring you...

452
00:24:54,883 --> 00:24:56,629
Noisettes!

453
00:25:12,292 --> 00:25:13,292
Hey.

454
00:26:29,114 --> 00:26:30,643
- I'll be right back.
- Ok.

455
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:36,690
- Hey.
- Hey!

456
00:26:37,018 --> 00:26:38,343
The show just started.

457
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:39,963
- Fine.
- Good.

458
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,750
Did you talk to David?

459
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:43,143
Yeah.

460
00:26:43,784 --> 00:26:45,584
I don't want to hurt him, Haley.

461
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,505
This is what I have to do.

462
00:26:47,713 --> 00:26:48,924
You okay?

463
00:26:49,518 --> 00:26:51,252
I'm fine, I'm fine.

464
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:53,427
This is Brooke's night.

465
00:26:59,237 --> 00:27:01,393
I can't do this, what if they laugh?

466
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:05,862
Nobody is gonna laugh. Your hot ass is
about to pull the roof off of this place.

467
00:27:05,882 --> 00:27:07,815
- Millie, are you ready for this?
- I don't know Brooke,

468
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:10,485
it doesn't feel right. I'm not a size zero.

469
00:27:11,237 --> 00:27:14,424
- What did you just say?
- I said I'm not a size zero.

470
00:27:15,815 --> 00:27:17,628
Of course you're not.

471
00:27:18,268 --> 00:27:20,518
Millie, I have an idea,
I just need more time.

472
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,081
I got this.

473
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,511
Is that Millie? She looks gorgeous!

474
00:28:45,826 --> 00:28:48,271
So, you were clearly the crowd favorite tonight.

475
00:28:48,306 --> 00:28:51,044
When did you come out with this
idea to put yourself in the show?

476
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:53,063
Well, the truth is, one of our models...

477
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:55,955
One of our models, Alex Dupre
she was brought in specially

478
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:58,913
to headline this collection.
She was a fabulous choice,

479
00:28:58,948 --> 00:29:01,791
but we had this little surprise
planned for several months.

480
00:29:01,826 --> 00:29:04,164
Clothes Over Bros is a line for real women.

481
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:06,083
Zero is not a size.

482
00:29:06,337 --> 00:29:09,200
We're just thrilled that all of you
responded the way we hoped you will.

483
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:11,334
Thank you so much for coming.

484
00:29:11,827 --> 00:29:13,882
I'll give it to you... you're good.

485
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:14,917
I know.

486
00:29:16,657 --> 00:29:18,031
Hey Alex, is Brooke around?

487
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:20,361
Oh,she's somewhere receiving praise.

488
00:29:20,396 --> 00:29:21,941
I thought you were avoiding me.

489
00:29:21,976 --> 00:29:23,298
Why would I avoid you?

490
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:26,071
I don't know. Maybe because you
haven't read the script I gave you?

491
00:29:26,106 --> 00:29:27,409
Oh, I read it.

492
00:29:27,513 --> 00:29:29,198
You want my honest opinion?

493
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:30,439
Of course.

494
00:29:30,695 --> 00:29:32,300
It's not that good.

495
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:33,926
Which part?

496
00:29:34,626 --> 00:29:36,837
The beginning, middle and end.

497
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,622
Ok, uh... what did you hate about it?

498
00:29:40,748 --> 00:29:44,682
I didn't say I hated it. The
writing just needs a little focus.

499
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:49,057
But somewhere underneath all the clutter,
I think there is a really solid story there.

500
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:52,384
I wouldn't mind meeting with the writer. I got a few ideas.

501
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:54,605
I wrote it.

502
00:29:55,052 --> 00:29:57,664
- You wrote what?
- That clutter filled messy you hated.

503
00:29:57,699 --> 00:30:00,225
- No, I told you, I didn't hate it.
- You said it wasn't good.

504
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,380
I also said it has potential.

505
00:30:02,612 --> 00:30:04,899
And if that's your first script...

506
00:30:05,807 --> 00:30:07,656
I am really impressed, Alex.

507
00:30:08,113 --> 00:30:11,120
If you're serious about this, I would
be willing to work with you on it.

508
00:30:11,155 --> 00:30:13,051
But only if you're committeed.

509
00:30:13,506 --> 00:30:15,967
I would love to commit to you, Julian.

510
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:22,651
- We're totally gonna make this movie.
- Okay, hold on.

511
00:30:22,686 --> 00:30:25,053
Let's get the script in shape
first, after that we'll see.

512
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:26,088
Ok.

513
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:42,284
I forgot.

514
00:30:42,557 --> 00:30:45,545
How'd it go with the famous
actress? Was it oscar worthy?

515
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:47,846
- It was just sex.
- Right.

516
00:30:49,234 --> 00:30:52,273
You know, I'm trying to figure out if this is the person you really are

517
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:55,337
or just the person you want
everyone to think that you are.

518
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,467
Maybe a little of both.

519
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,106
You look like you need a drink.

520
00:31:03,776 --> 00:31:04,776
Yes.

521
00:31:05,335 --> 00:31:07,690
I want one of those blue
drinks, those look good.

522
00:31:08,861 --> 00:31:09,861
Chase...

523
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:11,837
another brain hemorrhage.

524
00:31:12,098 --> 00:31:14,293
It's called a brain blaster now.

525
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,899
Right, just make sure it's extra blue.

526
00:31:24,476 --> 00:31:26,315
- What's this?
- That's the last minute changes.

527
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,136
- Who made them.
- Charlie.

528
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,846
We're alive at three...

529
00:31:31,596 --> 00:31:32,624
two...

530
00:32:05,451 --> 00:32:06,451
Miranda.

531
00:32:06,896 --> 00:32:07,937
Listen...

532
00:32:07,972 --> 00:32:10,296
I just wanted to thank you for
what you did earlier.

533
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:12,429
I felt a little blindsight in there, and...

534
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:14,680
it meant a lot that you stuck up for me.

535
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:16,263
I'm just being consistent.

536
00:32:16,298 --> 00:32:19,568
If they're not willing to let you use
personal issues as an excuse to get off work,

537
00:32:19,603 --> 00:32:23,276
I am certainly not gonna let
some bitch come in the way.

538
00:32:23,311 --> 00:32:26,415
Ok. Well, whatever your motivation was, thank you.

539
00:32:26,596 --> 00:32:29,977
You're welcome. And besides,
I've I always hated that cow.

540
00:32:35,062 --> 00:32:38,807
And Albert Pujols continued his
torrid summer by knocking in 4 runs,

541
00:32:38,842 --> 00:32:42,131
as the Redbirds drop the Phillies 8 to 5.

542
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,259
And finally...

543
00:32:50,323 --> 00:32:52,792
that is the night in sports.

544
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:57,254
Go to commercial, go to commercial now.

545
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,688
You just keep walking McFadden.

546
00:33:03,723 --> 00:33:05,707
You're off the air.

547
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:40,158
- What took you so long?
- Sorry.

548
00:33:40,193 --> 00:33:42,079
Running low on Jagermaister and Sambuca.

549
00:33:42,114 --> 00:33:43,447
Is he being serious?

550
00:33:43,743 --> 00:33:47,948
Yep, never mind that. Just sit back and
enjoy this delicious blue masterpiece.

551
00:33:53,749 --> 00:33:56,664
- That's really good, thank you.
- You are the boss.

552
00:33:58,173 --> 00:34:00,136
Oh my God, you're so evil.

553
00:34:00,462 --> 00:34:03,162
I'm sure I'm gonna have nightmares about
this drink. Why would you do that?

554
00:34:03,197 --> 00:34:06,260
So now we can say we both went throught it.

555
00:34:07,898 --> 00:34:09,263
Can I talk to you?

556
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:11,915
David.

557
00:34:12,952 --> 00:34:14,854
Look, this isn't the time or place for this.

558
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:17,179
- You're my wife, Quinn.
- And you're drunk.

559
00:34:17,727 --> 00:34:19,850
Just go home and sleep it off,
ok? We'll talk about it later.

560
00:34:19,885 --> 00:34:21,983
- No, I want to talk about it now.
- No, I don't want to.

561
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,743
- I want to talk about it now.
- No.

562
00:34:23,778 --> 00:34:25,210
You need to back up.

563
00:34:25,245 --> 00:34:27,493
And you need to stay out of this,
this is none of your business.

564
00:34:27,528 --> 00:34:30,953
I'm making it my business, alright?
You think you're having a rough day.

565
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:35,278
Damn it, Clay.

566
00:34:44,652 --> 00:34:47,272
Fighting over a girl... huge turn on.

567
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,403
I was just defending a friend.

568
00:34:49,438 --> 00:34:52,396
Well, that's good to know,
I was getting a little jealous.

569
00:34:53,378 --> 00:34:55,422
You know, I'm still turned on though.

570
00:34:55,457 --> 00:34:58,076
How about I come over later
and take care of that hand...

571
00:34:58,111 --> 00:35:01,806
and any other body part that
might need special attention?

572
00:35:03,193 --> 00:35:04,806
Maybe some other time.

573
00:35:07,068 --> 00:35:09,953
You did great tonight, Alex. I'll see you.

574
00:35:15,517 --> 00:35:16,674
Nathan Scott!

575
00:35:16,752 --> 00:35:21,224
Do you have a comment regarding the allegations
made about you in the National Informer?

576
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:23,732
Yes, I do have a comment.

577
00:35:23,966 --> 00:35:27,307
I'd just like to say, I'm very proud of my friend Brooke Davis.

578
00:35:27,372 --> 00:35:30,981
Tonight she reminded all of us just how talented she is.

579
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,997
As for the other stuff, no I have no comment.

580
00:35:34,478 --> 00:35:35,596
Thanks.

581
00:35:41,857 --> 00:35:44,768
I hate to admit it, but
Millicent really did pull it off.

582
00:35:44,807 --> 00:35:47,354
Yeah. And Alex really pulled it off her.

583
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:52,115
- She did. That was a good idea.
- Thank you.

584
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:55,417
I tell you what's not such a good idea...

585
00:35:55,469 --> 00:35:57,951
letting that girl got to close to Julian.

586
00:35:58,042 --> 00:35:59,145
Alex?

587
00:36:01,094 --> 00:36:03,942
He just read some script she gave him.

588
00:36:04,046 --> 00:36:07,867
- Julian is a good guy, mom.
- Yes, he is.

589
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:13,175
And I have a feeling she wrecked
a few good guys in her day.

590
00:36:21,603 --> 00:36:22,721
Hey, Alex.

591
00:36:23,254 --> 00:36:26,022
Listen, I just wanted to thank you
for everything you did for me tonight.

592
00:36:26,074 --> 00:36:28,460
I still can't believe that was me.

593
00:36:28,785 --> 00:36:30,813
- Hum, I'll see you tomorrow.
- Hold on, bitch.

594
00:36:30,878 --> 00:36:33,243
There's no way I'm letting you go home.

595
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:36,402
There's an after-after party that
nobody's invited to, except us.

596
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:38,559
- You're going.
- That's not really my scene.

597
00:36:38,611 --> 00:36:42,291
It is now. Look, don't worry I'll have your
cute ass home before the sun comes up.

598
00:36:42,356 --> 00:36:44,487
And if you hate it, we'll leave.

599
00:36:45,488 --> 00:36:47,231
Come on, come on.

600
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,662
Please? Say yes.

601
00:36:54,598 --> 00:36:56,391
- Yes.
- Yes.

602
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:57,860
Let's go. Come on.

603
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,193
Hey, Millie. It's me.

604
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:06,977
I kinda had a bad night, so
I was really hoping to talk to you.

605
00:37:07,068 --> 00:37:09,109
You always make me feel better.

606
00:37:09,434 --> 00:37:12,521
Anyway, I'm sure the show is great
and I can't wait to hear all about it.

607
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:14,509
I'll wait up. I love you.

608
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:01,776
You know, even with all the
models on this stage tonight

609
00:38:01,997 --> 00:38:04,713
the most beautiful woman
at the show was backstage.

610
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,213
Thank you.

611
00:38:06,265 --> 00:38:07,980
No, I was talking about Victoria.

612
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:15,308
I'm thinking of setting her up with my dad.
Apparently she's in search of a lover.

613
00:38:15,789 --> 00:38:18,193
- What just happened?
- Don't ask.

614
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:19,311
Ok.

615
00:38:20,685 --> 00:38:24,455
I saw you talking to Alex. How did she take it
when you told her you don't like the script?

616
00:38:24,494 --> 00:38:26,989
Actually, it turns out, she wrote
it, and she needs some help.

617
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:29,460
So I'm gonna work with her on that.

618
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:33,814
Who knows? Maybe we can get it in a good
enough shape and make a movie out of it.

619
00:38:41,294 --> 00:38:43,214
I don't know how I'm gonna do this.

620
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:47,445
I don't know how to let you go.
I don't know how to keep you.

621
00:38:48,497 --> 00:38:50,300
This isn't you, Quinn.

622
00:38:52,094 --> 00:38:53,874
Maybe you're right, David.

623
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:57,293
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

624
00:38:57,539 --> 00:38:59,639
Is this the life you want?

625
00:39:00,406 --> 00:39:02,160
Fancy parties, celebrities?

626
00:39:02,212 --> 00:39:04,403
Or is that the life you think you want.

627
00:39:05,464 --> 00:39:07,180
Maybe a little of both.

628
00:39:13,197 --> 00:39:15,394
I want you to go home, David.

629
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,676
I think it's time we move on with our lives.

630
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:26,621
You need to go home and let go of me.

631
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,106
I won't.

632
00:39:33,198 --> 00:39:34,446
You're gonna have to.

633
00:39:35,161 --> 00:39:38,741
You know, you're... working hard to
convince yourself that's it's over,

634
00:39:39,014 --> 00:39:40,952
but you'll never love me again.

635
00:39:43,032 --> 00:39:46,424
But nothing you do is gonna
make me go with hope.

636
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,365
You'd be better off letting me go.

637
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,280
- Give me a ride?
- Sure.

638
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:09,980
Where to?

639
00:40:10,551 --> 00:40:11,656
Your place.

640
00:40:16,503 --> 00:40:18,160
You sure you wanna do this?

641
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:20,753
He'll never forgive you.

642
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:23,735
Just drive.

643
00:40:39,911 --> 00:40:41,198
What are you doing here?

644
00:40:41,848 --> 00:40:43,108
He doesn't love you.

645
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,410
Honey, you don't know
what you're talking about.

646
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:50,325
He told me while we were making love.

647
00:40:50,858 --> 00:40:53,249
Get the hell out of my way, slut.

648
00:40:53,437 --> 00:40:56,179
Maybe I am a slut, but that's
what Nathan liked about me.

649
00:40:56,231 --> 00:41:00,105
He had me do all kinds of things to him
that he said you would never...

650
00:41:04,516 --> 00:41:06,257
You're gonna pay for that one.

651
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,032
