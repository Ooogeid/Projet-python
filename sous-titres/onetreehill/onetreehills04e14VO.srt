1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,348
Previously on One Tree Hill...

2
00:00:01,378 --> 00:00:03,626
This is the first draft
to a novel I'm writing.

3
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:04,980
Who knew?

4
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,930
No one.

5
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:08,894
I could pass calculus in my sleep.
You're the one flunking out.

6
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:11,349
This is the key to the
cabinet with the answers.

7
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:12,259
Got it.

8
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:13,669
My mom tried to kill herself.

9
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:16,007
I felt relieved,
like maybe it was for the best.

10
00:00:16,037 --> 00:00:17,390
Have you guys met Chase?

11
00:00:17,423 --> 00:00:20,079
He's our newest Clean Teen,
virgins for life.

12
00:00:20,459 --> 00:00:23,145
Hi. Brooke Davis -- Clean Teen.

13
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:27,071
I'm kind of afraid of
being here with you.

14
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:28,640
- Why?
- You're hot.

15
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:35,923
Open your eyes, Luke.

16
00:00:35,956 --> 00:00:38,612
I saw Jimmy lying
on the floor dead

17
00:00:38,646 --> 00:00:41,623
and Keith was standing above him.
Jimmy didn't kill Keith.

18
00:00:41,656 --> 00:00:44,473
Lucas said something
really unsettling today.

19
00:00:44,775 --> 00:00:45,841
What did he say?

20
00:00:47,436 --> 00:00:50,523
He said he doesn't think that
Jimmy Edwards killed Keith.

21
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:01,902
Do you ever wonder if we make
the moments in our lives

22
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,141
or if the moments in
our lives make us?

23
00:01:05,578 --> 00:01:08,560
Give me five, give me five!
Come on!

24
00:01:08,595 --> 00:01:10,290
- Five!
- Five!

25
00:01:17,918 --> 00:01:18,941
Nice shot.

26
00:01:18,976 --> 00:01:21,840
- Can you say merry Christmas?
- Merry Christmas.

27
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,980
It's amazing how fast they grow up,
isn't it?

28
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:33,563
Ouch.

29
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:37,350
Keith bought me that bike.

30
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:43,310
Hey, mom. Don't forget.
I got to get fitted for my tux today.

31
00:01:43,347 --> 00:01:45,000
Right, the prom.

32
00:01:45,547 --> 00:01:48,441
You come by the café,
and we'll go take a look this afternoon.

33
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,512
All right.

34
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,352
How's he doing?

35
00:01:55,086 --> 00:01:58,402
I mean, with this notion about Keith
not being taken by the Edwards kid?

36
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:01,310
I think he just needs to
believe in it somehow.

37
00:02:02,506 --> 00:02:04,890
Let me take him shopping
this afternoon for the tux.

38
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:07,213
I've missed enough important
moments in his life.

39
00:02:07,456 --> 00:02:09,311
I'd like to do
something about that.

40
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,151
Please?

41
00:02:15,697 --> 00:02:16,801
Hey, Glenda.

42
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:19,371
Hi.

43
00:02:20,397 --> 00:02:21,882
Oh, you remember Peyton, right?

44
00:02:22,237 --> 00:02:24,470
Yeah, sure -- the loner.

45
00:02:24,505 --> 00:02:26,240
Loner cheerleader.

46
00:02:26,935 --> 00:02:29,430
I really liked the
picture you took of Lucas.

47
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:32,322
The eye shadow was a little
Fall Out Boy, though.

48
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,550
So, Lucas,
that book that you loaned me,

49
00:02:35,586 --> 00:02:38,791
I'm just in chapter 10,
but I'd love to talk to you about it.

50
00:02:38,827 --> 00:02:41,092
Yeah. Good, no, anytime.

51
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,313
Okay.

52
00:02:43,017 --> 00:02:44,100
Bye.

53
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:48,361
- What book?
- Oh, I, um --

54
00:02:48,398 --> 00:02:50,491
I loaned her a copy of
"The Great Gatsby."

55
00:02:50,525 --> 00:02:52,533
She's never read it.
Can you believe that?

56
00:02:52,566 --> 00:02:55,220
I took her for more of an
Edgar Allan Poe kind of girl.

57
00:02:59,796 --> 00:03:00,990
We should slow down.

58
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:02,940
It feels like just
the right speed to me.

59
00:03:05,347 --> 00:03:08,193
Really... I have to go.

60
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:09,931
Saved by the bell.

61
00:03:32,778 --> 00:03:33,630
Hey.

62
00:03:34,135 --> 00:03:36,791
I got to ask you something, and I really
don't want you to get pissed off,

63
00:03:36,827 --> 00:03:38,243
but I have to ask you.

64
00:03:38,276 --> 00:03:39,141
Okay.

65
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,672
It's about the stolen test.

66
00:03:40,707 --> 00:03:44,611
You were failing calculus, and then
you just got an "A" on the last test.

67
00:03:44,837 --> 00:03:46,853
Just tell me it's
a coincidence.

68
00:03:46,886 --> 00:03:48,220
It was a coincidence.

69
00:03:48,258 --> 00:03:50,232
- Seriously, Brooke.
- Yeah.

70
00:03:50,265 --> 00:03:52,242
I know I have to pass
the class to graduate,

71
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:53,630
and  you were busy
tutoring Rachel,

72
00:03:53,636 --> 00:03:55,872
so I just got help
from Chase instead.

73
00:03:56,786 --> 00:03:57,862
Really?

74
00:03:58,977 --> 00:03:59,932
Okay.

75
00:04:00,995 --> 00:04:01,852
Sorry.

76
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:05,502
Principal Turner's just really pissed
right now, he's on a major witch hunt.

77
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:09,052
You should probably know you're,
like, the prime suspect.

78
00:04:09,556 --> 00:04:10,993
It wasn't me.

79
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:12,223
Scout's honor.

80
00:04:12,257 --> 00:04:13,602
Okay. Sorry.

81
00:04:20,698 --> 00:04:22,333
Why the long face?

82
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:24,122
You know what today is.

83
00:04:24,455 --> 00:04:27,912
No, but I'm sure you're
about to enlighten me.

84
00:04:29,506 --> 00:04:30,782
Come on.

85
00:04:32,676 --> 00:04:35,042
You've got three
weeks of sobriety.

86
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:37,863
It's the first day
you can have visitors.

87
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,643
It's a good day.

88
00:04:41,187 --> 00:04:44,580
After the way I behaved,
no one is coming for me.

89
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,003
Trust me.

90
00:04:46,748 --> 00:04:48,720
Hey, don't be so sure.

91
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:50,321
Sometimes...

92
00:04:51,128 --> 00:04:52,761
people can surprise you.

93
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:00,712
Are you on drugs?!

94
00:05:00,748 --> 00:05:02,440
You're not turning yourself in.

95
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:03,983
I just had to lie to Haley.

96
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:06,493
Turner is closing in,
and I am stupid.

97
00:05:06,726 --> 00:05:08,520
Brooke, they don't
have any proof.

98
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:11,020
There's no use to this.
I'm going to turn myself in.

99
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:12,430
Fine. Whatever.

100
00:05:13,006 --> 00:05:14,622
Before you turn yourself in...

101
00:05:15,386 --> 00:05:18,422
you might want to
take a look at this.

102
00:05:18,455 --> 00:05:19,892
It came for you this morning.

103
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,050
Oh, my god.

104
00:05:27,585 --> 00:05:29,990
Victoria's Secret wants to
franchise Clothes Over Bro's

105
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:31,722
for  their pink fashion line.

106
00:05:32,255 --> 00:05:34,632
I-I'm going to be in
stores everywhere!

107
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,593
Maybe not.

108
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,212
Look at paragraph 14.

109
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,591
So I like reading your mail.
It's a guilty pleasure.

110
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:43,693
The contract has
a morality clause.

111
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:46,222
That means they want student-council
president Brooke Davis,

112
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:48,620
not "I cheated in
calculus" Brooke Davis.

113
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:51,223
I don't think an expelled
high-school student exactly fits

114
00:05:51,258 --> 00:05:52,883
the Victoria's Secret profile.

115
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:54,403
What am I going to do?

116
00:05:55,347 --> 00:05:57,361
Nothing. Brooke, trust me.

117
00:05:57,397 --> 00:06:00,031
There's nothing they can do to
prove you cheated on the test.

118
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:03,962
As some of you may know,
it has come to my attention

119
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:07,072
that one of you cheated
on the last exam.

120
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:10,943
So today we're all going
to take a little pop quiz.

121
00:06:11,278 --> 00:06:15,153
And I assure you,
when I discover who that cheater is,

122
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:19,581
they will be dealt with in
the harshest possible way.

123
00:06:20,665 --> 00:06:22,382
Didn't see that one coming.

124
00:07:12,105 --> 00:07:14,892
So, I was thinking we
would get a limo for prom.

125
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:16,903
I talked to Brooke,
and she and Chase want to share.

126
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,091
Mouth, can I talk to
you for a minute?

127
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:31,343
I don't think I can do this.

128
00:07:31,635 --> 00:07:32,622
What "this"?

129
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:33,930
Us. 

130
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,593
I think maybe it's not such a
good idea that we're dating.

131
00:07:39,678 --> 00:07:41,273
It's about them, isn't it?

132
00:07:41,307 --> 00:07:42,703
The Clean Teens.

133
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:45,333
It's more complicated that.

134
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,980
Explain it to me 'cause I'm
pretty good with complicated.

135
00:07:48,078 --> 00:07:49,692
I can't go out with you.

136
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:55,862
Okay, so, we're not dating,
but we're --

137
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:57,493
we're still going
to prom, right?

138
00:07:57,527 --> 00:08:00,010
I don't think prom would be
such a good idea, either.

139
00:08:02,406 --> 00:08:03,611
This  was...

140
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:07,321
This was a mistake.

141
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:09,342
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:19,592
Maybe you passed
the test this time.

143
00:08:19,705 --> 00:08:22,230
I mean,
stranger things have happened...

144
00:08:22,263 --> 00:08:26,099
like Brooke Davis is
dating a Clean Teen.

145
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:27,615
Maybe.

146
00:08:27,994 --> 00:08:30,051
And it didn't feel that bad.

147
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:33,880
Oh, who am I kidding?
There's no way I passed that test.

148
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:36,352
Brooke, this could be the chance
that you need to start over.

149
00:08:36,497 --> 00:08:38,360
Think about it.
If you pass this time,

150
00:08:38,397 --> 00:08:39,773
you did it all on your own.

151
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:42,442
Yeah, and if I didn't pass,
I'm going to get expelled from school,

152
00:08:42,478 --> 00:08:44,783
and my life as I
know it is over.

153
00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:46,582
Well, I believe in you.

154
00:08:47,698 --> 00:08:51,252
Brooke Davis, please report to the
principal's office immediately.

155
00:08:53,245 --> 00:08:54,693
Well, okay, then.

156
00:08:55,256 --> 00:08:56,770
Dead girl kissing.

157
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:01,292
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

158
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:08,993
Nice fit for a rental.

159
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,742
What are you -- 42 regular?

160
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,021
Yeah.

161
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:14,183
Not bad.

162
00:09:15,465 --> 00:09:18,312
The trick with formal wear
is to always go classic.

163
00:09:18,618 --> 00:09:20,430
You don't want to be that guy
looking back 20 years from now

164
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:22,143
regretting the blue ruffles.

165
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,251
Mmm, yeah, right.

166
00:09:24,288 --> 00:09:25,512
What did you wear to prom?

167
00:09:25,547 --> 00:09:26,672
Blue ruffles.

168
00:09:29,175 --> 00:09:33,213
Hey, Lucas, I know it's been hard
for you without Keith around,

169
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:36,142
and your mother told me what
you said about Jimmy Edwards.

170
00:09:36,296 --> 00:09:38,030
And I just want
you to know that...

171
00:09:38,068 --> 00:09:40,393
you may not be wrong in
what you're thinking.

172
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:43,262
You don't think
Jimmy killed Keith?

173
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:46,560
Not exactly. What I mean is,
I know you and Jimmy were friends,

174
00:09:46,596 --> 00:09:49,710
and maybe you're right.
Maybe Jimmy didn't mean to kill Keith.

175
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:51,933
Maybe what happened in that
hallway was a terrible accident.

176
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:53,351
But the truth is...

177
00:09:53,698 --> 00:09:55,222
we'll never know.

178
00:09:58,115 --> 00:10:00,071
So I need to ask
you a favor, Lucas.

179
00:10:00,837 --> 00:10:03,671
I need you to stop and consider
your mother's feelings.

180
00:10:04,495 --> 00:10:06,292
Because although
she'll never admit it,

181
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:09,093
all this talk is breaking
her up on the inside.

182
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:10,783
So you got to let it go...

183
00:10:10,928 --> 00:10:12,281
for her sake.

184
00:10:13,218 --> 00:10:14,653
How we doing, gentlemen?

185
00:10:14,686 --> 00:10:17,110
Fine, thanks.
We're going to take this Armani.

186
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,100
Sorry, sir. The Armani is
only available for purchase.

187
00:10:20,135 --> 00:10:22,521
I'm aware of that, Slick.
We'll take the Armani.

188
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:26,101
You're buying me a tuxedo?

189
00:10:26,257 --> 00:10:28,310
Every man should
own his own tuxedo.

190
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:31,491
And every father should know what it
feels like to buy one for his son.

191
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:46,760
Nathan.

192
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:48,272
Hi.

193
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:53,811
I-I-I wasn't sure
you'd want to see me.

194
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:56,312
To be honest,
I wasn't sure I was coming.

195
00:10:58,206 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

196
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:02,700
Suicide -- nice one, mom.

197
00:11:02,737 --> 00:11:04,462
And thanks for the note,
by the way.

198
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,262
Please, Nathan, don't.

199
00:11:06,995 --> 00:11:09,901
You can't begin to
understand this disease.

200
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,250
"Disease"?

201
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:13,572
Is that what you're
calling it now?

202
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:15,721
Peyton's mom, Ellie,
had a disease.

203
00:11:15,757 --> 00:11:18,372
Cancer --
that's a disease, mom.

204
00:11:18,456 --> 00:11:20,420
What you have is a weakness.

205
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:22,770
And when the hell are you
going to start fighting it?

206
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:24,181
I know.

207
00:11:24,397 --> 00:11:26,631
I know I've been weak.

208
00:11:26,968 --> 00:11:28,120
But I...

209
00:11:29,818 --> 00:11:32,092
- I'm scared.
- Of what?

210
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:35,471
Your -- Your terrible life in that big,
expensive house?

211
00:11:35,507 --> 00:11:38,271
'Cause I'm not seeing it, mom.
What are you so scared of?

212
00:11:40,836 --> 00:11:41,873
Myself.

213
00:11:44,945 --> 00:11:46,901
It's easy in here.

214
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:50,003
I-I have a support
team to stay sober.

215
00:11:50,856 --> 00:11:54,940
But out there, alone...

216
00:11:57,038 --> 00:11:59,173
I'm not sure I
can trust myself.

217
00:12:00,546 --> 00:12:01,613
Mom...

218
00:12:03,437 --> 00:12:04,820
you better figure it out.

219
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:07,530
Because if things
don't change soon,

220
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,221
you're not going to have
anything to come home to.

221
00:12:19,675 --> 00:12:20,622
Thanks.

222
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,362
It's pretty cool.
I think Peyton really going to love it.

223
00:12:23,395 --> 00:12:26,012
You're welcome.
So, Peyton, huh?

224
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:27,651
Yeah.

225
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:30,702
Well, have a good time,
senior state champ.

226
00:12:30,735 --> 00:12:32,321
It's a good time to be alive.

227
00:12:32,927 --> 00:12:36,391
By the way,
the state championship...

228
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,611
You didn't take your HCM medication,
did you?

229
00:12:40,057 --> 00:12:41,212
Why would you say that?

230
00:12:41,246 --> 00:12:44,150
Because I take those pills, Lucas.
We have the same condition.

231
00:12:44,217 --> 00:12:46,602
You can fool other people,
but you can't fool me.

232
00:12:46,638 --> 00:12:49,212
Well, it'll be our secret.

233
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:51,940
Just promise me you won't do
anything that stupid again, okay?

234
00:12:51,977 --> 00:12:53,333
Your mom's already
been through enough.

235
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:55,591
She needs you healthy
and in one piece.

236
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:02,291
- Hey.
- Hey.

237
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:04,172
There you guys are.
What took you so long?

238
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:07,162
Well, we decided to turn
a rental into a purchase.

239
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:09,822
I know I should have cleared
it with you first, but...

240
00:13:09,898 --> 00:13:11,512
I couldn't help myself.

241
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:13,372
His idea.

242
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:21,201
Um, Dan, we need to --
we need to talk about this.

243
00:13:21,588 --> 00:13:22,700
Talk about what?

244
00:13:22,737 --> 00:13:24,672
You and him --

245
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:27,481
all of this, everything.

246
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:30,461
Okay. How about dinner?

247
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,770
I'll pick you up around 7:00.

248
00:13:31,807 --> 00:13:33,143
That sounds like a date.

249
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:35,493
No, no date...

250
00:13:36,577 --> 00:13:37,832
Just dinner.

251
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:48,663
Ah, miss Davis.

252
00:13:50,477 --> 00:13:52,683
It's about your calculus exam.

253
00:13:55,926 --> 00:13:57,942
It seems I owe you an apology.

254
00:14:00,968 --> 00:14:03,323
I passed the test!
Turner just apologized.

255
00:14:03,357 --> 00:14:05,883
I guess all my studying paid off.
How cool is that?

256
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:07,341
Congratulations.

257
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:10,430
Now you're free to be Victoria's
Secret's next big thing.

258
00:14:10,465 --> 00:14:13,842
You know it. Okay, you are good
with all this legal mumbo jumbo,

259
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:15,790
so,  what do I do next?

260
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:19,183
Um, it seems pretty basic.

261
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:20,911
In addition to your designs,

262
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:23,981
you just have to turn over the artwork,
and you're good to go.

263
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:26,481
Artwork?

264
00:14:33,787 --> 00:14:35,862
Hey, principal Turner.
You wanted to see me?

265
00:14:35,896 --> 00:14:38,740
Yes. Please have a seat, Haley.

266
00:14:44,628 --> 00:14:47,530
We've discovered who
stole the calculus exam,

267
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:49,933
and, unfortunately,
it's someone you know.

268
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:54,563
Rachel Gatina.

269
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,581
It's not --
are you sure it's Rachel?

270
00:15:01,618 --> 00:15:03,341
Well, I've spoken
to miss Gatina.

271
00:15:03,378 --> 00:15:04,882
I'm quite sure.

272
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,553
Haley, you were tutoring her,

273
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:10,083
and I'm afraid I have no choice but
to ask you to resign your position

274
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,550
at the tutor center
effective immediatly.

275
00:15:12,587 --> 00:15:15,613
- No, look, principal Turner --
- My decision is final.

276
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:21,581
I'll need your key.

277
00:15:29,935 --> 00:15:32,232
I'm sorry it came
to this, Haley.

278
00:15:32,606 --> 00:15:34,193
Word of advice?

279
00:15:34,557 --> 00:15:37,572
I might take a good look at
who your real friends are.

280
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:44,663
What do you mean you got fired?

281
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:45,801
It was Rachel.

282
00:15:45,837 --> 00:15:48,291
I was right about her all along.
She was the one that stole the exam,

283
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:50,720
and because I was tutoring her,
they let me go.

284
00:15:50,755 --> 00:15:51,433
Bitch.

285
00:15:51,465 --> 00:15:52,873
But you had nothing
to do with it.

286
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:54,141
Didn't you just tell 
principal Turner?

287
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:57,361
Yeah, I did. I told him,
and he said, "it's school policy."

288
00:15:58,408 --> 00:16:01,981
It just really sucks. I love tutoring,
and we really needed that extra money.

289
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:05,761
I'm so sorry, Haley.
I know I went to bat for her.

290
00:16:05,795 --> 00:16:07,883
I knew it.
I knew I was right about her.

291
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,703
I'm sorry.
Look, it's not your fault.

292
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:13,352
I know you were just trying to
help her and just trying to...

293
00:16:14,397 --> 00:16:15,683
be a good guy.

294
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:17,310
That's what I love about you.

295
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:23,220
I  don't feel like such
a good guy right now.

296
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:24,403
Why?

297
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:27,680
I went to see my mom this morning,
and, uh,

298
00:16:28,265 --> 00:16:30,281
I think I was kind
of hard on her.

299
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:33,903
Babe, if anybody's in need of
tough love, it's your mom.

300
00:16:33,936 --> 00:16:35,371
I know, but...

301
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,262
she's going to be
released in a few days,

302
00:16:37,298 --> 00:16:40,220
and she told me that she's
scared to be alone in the house.

303
00:16:40,256 --> 00:16:42,643
She's going to slip, Haley.
I can feel it.

304
00:16:42,676 --> 00:16:45,092
Well, why don't we do
something about it?

305
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:46,261
Like what?

306
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:49,440
I don't know. We need to save money.
She needs help.

307
00:16:49,888 --> 00:16:54,533
We could... let the apartment
go and move into her house.

308
00:16:54,565 --> 00:16:56,893
Yeah, look. It would be perfect.
We'd save money,

309
00:16:56,928 --> 00:16:59,032
and we'd be there
to watch her 24/7,

310
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:00,362
and everybody wins.

311
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,262
And Peyton thinks I'm a martyr.

312
00:17:02,295 --> 00:17:04,791
Come on, she's --
you know, she's your family.

313
00:17:04,827 --> 00:17:07,602
She's a train wreck,
but she's your mom.

314
00:17:09,386 --> 00:17:10,892
You'd do that for her?

315
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,612
No, but I'd do that for you.

316
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:22,392
Okay. My mom gets
home in a few days,

317
00:17:22,427 --> 00:17:25,332
and I need this house to be
completely drug-and alcohol-free.

318
00:17:25,368 --> 00:17:26,813
Let's fan out.

319
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:31,613
Dude, it's just Nathan's mom.

320
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:34,403
How much booze could we
possibly be talking about?

321
00:17:38,397 --> 00:17:39,422
Damn.

322
00:17:39,545 --> 00:17:42,183
Nate mom like the
alcoholic easter bunny.

323
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:43,800
Are we really going
to dump it all?

324
00:17:43,837 --> 00:17:45,072
Hold on a second.

325
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:48,133
It's friday.
Prom's tomorrow night.

326
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,193
We got a ton of booze,
a huge house,

327
00:17:50,226 --> 00:17:52,343
and we just won a
state championship.

328
00:17:52,825 --> 00:17:55,052
I like the way you think, dawg.

329
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:58,673
With a crib like this, a brother
could definitely get hooked up,

330
00:17:58,707 --> 00:18:01,732
especially if he got him a new
shortie with some hot leather pants.

331
00:18:01,765 --> 00:18:03,121
You feeling me, Mouth?

332
00:18:03,156 --> 00:18:05,920
Yeah, but I don't think she is.

333
00:18:10,526 --> 00:18:11,942
What you working on? 

334
00:18:15,747 --> 00:18:17,102
Look, um...

335
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:22,212
I got to be honest.
Today I kind of lied to you.

336
00:18:22,247 --> 00:18:25,092
The book that I gave Glenda
wasn't "The Gatsby."

337
00:18:27,446 --> 00:18:29,161
It's one I've been writing.

338
00:18:30,395 --> 00:18:34,583
And I needed an impartial opinion,
so I gave it to her.

339
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:43,473
I know there's no 10th
chapter in "Gatsby."

340
00:18:44,215 --> 00:18:46,382
But thank you for
telling me the truth.

341
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:47,742
I'm  sorry.

342
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:52,020
I guess I'm just worried
it's not going to be good.

343
00:18:52,058 --> 00:18:55,712
Well, what about me?
I can be impartial.

344
00:18:55,747 --> 00:18:57,333
- I don't think so.
- Why?!

345
00:18:57,365 --> 00:18:58,720
Because you're in it.

346
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,412
- Give me that book right now.
- No way.

347
00:19:01,448 --> 00:19:03,160
- Please!
- It's not ready.

348
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:07,200
Pretty please with...
me on top?

349
00:19:08,377 --> 00:19:11,631
Well, I can... be persuaded.

350
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:31,301
Okay, no.
Okay, stop, stop, stop.

351
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,771
I don't think so.

352
00:19:33,377 --> 00:19:36,200
Oh, come on. I'll let you read
the first six chapters of my book.

353
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:38,101
That's very sexy, um,

354
00:19:38,137 --> 00:19:40,853
but I just want our
first time to be special.

355
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:43,772
And right now it's
really not with...

356
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:47,643
nationals CD wedged
underneath my back...

357
00:19:47,675 --> 00:19:49,902
which is a very good album,
by the way.

358
00:19:50,635 --> 00:19:53,053
Plus, your mom's going
to come in any second.

359
00:19:53,736 --> 00:19:57,343
She's working at the café.
Nobody's going to walk in.

360
00:20:03,378 --> 00:20:06,353
Okay, my discomfort meter
is pretty much pegged.

361
00:20:08,386 --> 00:20:10,093
Hi. Sorry.

362
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,471
Luke, can I talk to
Peyton for a sec?

363
00:20:15,508 --> 00:20:16,723
Sure.

364
00:20:17,606 --> 00:20:19,893
Just, um, you know,
if you guys get into it,

365
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:22,203
try not to break
anything expensive.

366
00:20:29,797 --> 00:20:32,831
For the record,
I didn't come here to fight.

367
00:20:37,855 --> 00:20:42,090
Victoria's Secret has offered to
franchise Clothes Over Bro's.

368
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:45,903
So it's a really big,
huge deal for me,

369
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:50,290
but I can't move forward with it unless
you're willing to sign off on your artwork.

370
00:20:50,326 --> 00:20:51,572
So...

371
00:20:52,216 --> 00:20:55,821
I just need to know what you
need from me to make this work.

372
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:58,883
You have a pen?

373
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:06,571
What are you doing?

374
00:21:08,277 --> 00:21:10,651
I'm signing over
the artwork to you.

375
00:21:11,496 --> 00:21:13,560
They're just sketches, Brooke.
You're the one that turned them

376
00:21:13,595 --> 00:21:15,180
into Clothes Over Bro's.

377
00:21:15,998 --> 00:21:17,820
Congratulations, Brooke.

378
00:21:18,437 --> 00:21:20,433
Are you sure you're
comfortable with this?

379
00:21:20,465 --> 00:21:21,642
Sure.

380
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:23,681
I'm happy for you.

381
00:21:28,785 --> 00:21:30,143
You know I love him.

382
00:21:30,638 --> 00:21:31,902
I really do.

383
00:21:32,596 --> 00:21:35,511
But I never meant for my
love for him to hurt you.

384
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:40,641
Thank you, Peyton.

385
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:49,623
Um, Nathan, what is going on?

386
00:21:49,805 --> 00:21:52,390
Well, we never really got a chance
to celebrate winning state,

387
00:21:52,427 --> 00:21:55,071
and I figured with everything
that's been going on lately,

388
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:58,923
it might be nice to kick off
prom and have a little...

389
00:21:59,157 --> 00:22:01,190
- Party!
- Party!

390
00:22:08,346 --> 00:22:10,980
Don't look now, Mouth,
but Shelly all up in here right now.

391
00:22:11,016 --> 00:22:11,720
Where?

392
00:22:11,756 --> 00:22:13,530
12:00 and closing fast.

393
00:22:13,568 --> 00:22:16,591
Okay, on the count of three,
we are out of here. Ready? Three.

394
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,962
Is this how it's going to be?

395
00:22:24,997 --> 00:22:26,290
You're just going to ignore me?

396
00:22:26,325 --> 00:22:29,160
Let me guess. You're here to
tell me you want to be friends.

397
00:22:29,198 --> 00:22:31,300
I get it, Shelly.
You're not attracted to me.

398
00:22:31,336 --> 00:22:33,823
It's not that.
It is just the opposite.

399
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:37,140
It's because I am
attracted to you, Mouth.

400
00:22:38,676 --> 00:22:40,810
I'm just not sure I trust
myself to be with you.

401
00:22:40,845 --> 00:22:43,380
Let me get this straight.
You broke up with me the day before prom

402
00:22:43,415 --> 00:22:45,371
because you're so
attracted to me?

403
00:22:47,305 --> 00:22:49,561
Okay, I think I
really need a drink.

404
00:22:55,465 --> 00:22:57,622
Dan, this feels like a date.

405
00:22:57,767 --> 00:23:00,480
Let's just call it the mayor
and almost-mayor having dinner.

406
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:03,993
Karen, I want to start being
a bigger part of Lucas' life.

407
00:23:04,578 --> 00:23:06,471
He needs a father, and I...

408
00:23:07,466 --> 00:23:09,313
I want to be that
father to him,

409
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:11,122
regardless of what's
happening between us.

410
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,202
I'm pregnant with
your brother's child.

411
00:23:13,337 --> 00:23:15,892
There's nothing
happening between us.

412
00:23:17,936 --> 00:23:19,201
You're also alone.

413
00:23:21,126 --> 00:23:23,660
And if you need anything,
and I mean anything at all,

414
00:23:23,698 --> 00:23:25,790
I want to be the man
that you turn to.

415
00:23:35,036 --> 00:23:37,003
Luke, you got to help me
find some booze, man.

416
00:23:37,035 --> 00:23:38,682
It's going to get
ugly down there.

417
00:23:44,265 --> 00:23:45,610
You got to let this go, man.

418
00:23:51,885 --> 00:23:53,250
Keith's gone, Luke.

419
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:56,292
Jimmy's gone.

420
00:23:57,188 --> 00:23:58,993
Nothing's going to
bring them back.

421
00:24:00,546 --> 00:24:04,343
But... you got a ton of people
that love you out there,

422
00:24:04,455 --> 00:24:07,760
and in a few months, most of those
people are going to go their
separate ways.

423
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,443
So, what do you say,
big brother?

424
00:24:10,476 --> 00:24:11,842
Let's have some fun.

425
00:24:15,906 --> 00:24:17,222
- Hey.
- Hey. Oh, hey.

426
00:24:17,258 --> 00:24:19,791
I wanted to say congratulations
on your calculus test.

427
00:24:19,827 --> 00:24:22,420
Turner told me.
I am really sorry about this morning.

428
00:24:22,455 --> 00:24:23,872
I should never
have doubted you.

429
00:24:23,908 --> 00:24:25,253
I never doubted
her for a second.

430
00:24:25,287 --> 00:24:27,010
You should be really
proud of yourself, Brooke.

431
00:24:27,047 --> 00:24:30,071
Well, as tempting as it was to
be senior for another year,

432
00:24:30,106 --> 00:24:32,741
I figured it was probably
time for me to graduate.

433
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:36,162
Um, have you guys seen Rachel?

434
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:37,963
She was holding court
in the living room.

435
00:24:37,995 --> 00:24:39,352
Clothed or unclothed?

436
00:24:39,388 --> 00:24:41,850
Clothed, but it was
about 10 minutes ago,

437
00:24:41,886 --> 00:24:43,593
so you never know.

438
00:24:49,437 --> 00:24:51,483
So, we were in the chapter

439
00:24:51,518 --> 00:24:54,620
where you take your girlfriend up
to that empty bedroom at the party.

440
00:24:55,178 --> 00:24:58,402
I think I may need to do
a little research first.

441
00:24:58,437 --> 00:25:00,310
I was hoping you'd say that.

442
00:25:11,307 --> 00:25:13,983
Thank you, thank you.
Tip your waitresses.

443
00:25:14,017 --> 00:25:15,332
Or me.

444
00:25:18,525 --> 00:25:19,891
So, how'd you do it, Rachel?

445
00:25:19,927 --> 00:25:21,842
- Do what?
- Don't throw dumb-ass at me, girly.

446
00:25:21,878 --> 00:25:24,451
You stole that test,
and I want to know how you did it.

447
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:27,463
Did you steal my key while
I was in the hospital?

448
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:29,770
Yeah, I bet you did,
didn't you?

449
00:25:29,836 --> 00:25:31,753
You know, I could have spent
my time tutoring someone

450
00:25:31,785 --> 00:25:32,873
that actually needed it,

451
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:34,972
and now I'm not going to
have that opportunity again,

452
00:25:35,006 --> 00:25:36,151
thanks to you.

453
00:25:36,188 --> 00:25:37,490
- Whatever.
- So...

454
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,620
That is for getting me fired.

455
00:25:43,885 --> 00:25:47,942
And that is for trying to
sleep with my husband.

456
00:25:47,975 --> 00:25:49,283
Bitch, you are lucky
you're pregnant.

457
00:25:49,317 --> 00:25:50,771
Honey, you're lucky
that I'm pregnant.

458
00:25:50,807 --> 00:25:53,963
I think it's time you get your insecure,
cheating skank ass

459
00:25:53,996 --> 00:25:56,203
out of this house right now.

460
00:25:56,238 --> 00:25:57,311
You bit--

461
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,151
Yo, I think it's time
for you to leave.

462
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:09,951
Told you I got the kid's back.

463
00:26:16,846 --> 00:26:19,793
Rachel, wait.
What the hell was that?

464
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,713
What did you do to
piss off Haley?

465
00:26:23,858 --> 00:26:25,390
It was the exam.

466
00:26:25,898 --> 00:26:28,292
Haley found out
I stole it and...

467
00:26:28,475 --> 00:26:29,973
they fired her.

468
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:33,343
Guess I didn't see that
one coming, either.

469
00:26:33,378 --> 00:26:35,713
But how?
We both passed the retest.

470
00:26:36,197 --> 00:26:38,093
Not exactly, Copernicus.

471
00:26:38,385 --> 00:26:39,970
Only one of us did.

472
00:27:02,118 --> 00:27:03,983
Why would you do that?

473
00:27:04,847 --> 00:27:06,691
Victoria's Secret, Brooke...

474
00:27:08,495 --> 00:27:10,123
The morals clause.

475
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:14,193
Besides, I figured I
got you into this, so...

476
00:27:14,588 --> 00:27:16,122
I wanted to get you out.

477
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:20,812
You're my friend, Brooke.

478
00:27:23,265 --> 00:27:25,171
What are they going
to do to you now?

479
00:27:26,086 --> 00:27:28,563
Who knows? We'll see.

480
00:27:28,595 --> 00:27:29,903
Brooke, it's okay.

481
00:27:30,405 --> 00:27:31,611
I'll be fine.

482
00:27:32,226 --> 00:27:33,780
I'm going to take off.

483
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:36,160
Go back in and hang with Chase.

484
00:27:36,408 --> 00:27:37,931
I'll catch up with you at home.

485
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,193
Rachel...

486
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,242
Thank you.

487
00:27:58,028 --> 00:27:59,000
Haley.

488
00:27:59,256 --> 00:28:01,703
I heard you were fighting Rachel.
You punched her?

489
00:28:01,935 --> 00:28:03,900
It was more of a bitch-slap.

490
00:28:03,936 --> 00:28:06,281
Yeah, that was after she
threw the drink on her.

491
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:09,800
I'm okay. Don't worry about me.
I feel fi--

492
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,823
What is it? Are you okay?

493
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,181
Yeah, the baby's
just really kicking.

494
00:28:14,218 --> 00:28:15,443
It's kicking?

495
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,220
Oh, yeah.

496
00:28:19,425 --> 00:28:20,832
I feel it.

497
00:28:21,678 --> 00:28:22,913
That's our boy.

498
00:28:22,945 --> 00:28:24,261
Yeah.

499
00:28:40,508 --> 00:28:41,462
Mouth...

500
00:28:49,585 --> 00:28:50,853
Are you okay?

501
00:28:51,217 --> 00:28:52,211
No.

502
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:58,023
I know it's my fault.

503
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:02,990
I'm sorry.

504
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:08,840
It's just hard, you know?

505
00:29:10,237 --> 00:29:11,700
I look at you,

506
00:29:11,738 --> 00:29:15,183
and it hurts so much to know
that we can't be together.

507
00:29:16,345 --> 00:29:18,393
- Mouth.
- I know you're a Clean Teen, Shelly,

508
00:29:18,426 --> 00:29:20,261
but what do you want me to say?

509
00:29:21,158 --> 00:29:23,080
That I don't want
to sleep with you?

510
00:29:23,898 --> 00:29:26,660
That I don't want my
first time to be with you?

511
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:31,780
Well, I can't say that
'cause that would be a lie.

512
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:36,621
From the moment I saw you,
I was hooked.

513
00:29:36,766 --> 00:29:40,600
And I got to look into those
beautiful eyes and kiss you,

514
00:29:40,637 --> 00:29:42,711
and now that's
all I want to do.

515
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:46,223
I could kiss you forever.

516
00:29:50,585 --> 00:29:52,680
And I know I'm not good enough.

517
00:29:54,557 --> 00:29:55,550
No.

518
00:30:26,385 --> 00:30:29,233
So, is this where tomorrow
night's prom queen is hanging out?

519
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:34,421
What's up?

520
00:30:36,185 --> 00:30:37,992
I'm just worried about Rachel.

521
00:30:39,476 --> 00:30:40,833
That's my girl.

522
00:30:41,025 --> 00:30:43,840
There's a raging party going on,
and you're worried about a friend.

523
00:30:45,225 --> 00:30:47,020
You're a good person,
Brooke Davis.

524
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:49,220
You think so?

525
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:53,163
I've done some things
I'm really not proud of.

526
00:30:54,296 --> 00:30:55,691
You're a good person.

527
00:30:57,868 --> 00:30:59,181
You sure?

528
00:30:59,495 --> 00:31:00,782
I'm sure.

529
00:31:01,695 --> 00:31:03,883
Does that mean you want
to kiss me some more?

530
00:31:15,347 --> 00:31:17,651
Old school Nathan in the house.

531
00:31:26,758 --> 00:31:29,102
Scott -- Nathan Scott.

532
00:31:29,428 --> 00:31:31,272
That's my baby.

533
00:31:32,998 --> 00:31:34,703
Oh, snap!

534
00:31:34,736 --> 00:31:37,021
I thought you and
Nathan were married.

535
00:31:41,226 --> 00:31:43,192
Shelly, are you okay?

536
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:45,341
I mean, was that okay?

537
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:47,780
Yeah, I-I just got
to find my shirt.

538
00:31:55,217 --> 00:31:56,613
Aw, my bad.

539
00:31:59,988 --> 00:32:01,601
Nice work, though!

540
00:32:03,516 --> 00:32:04,963
Shelly...

541
00:32:06,127 --> 00:32:08,213
Hey, hey, don't cry.

542
00:32:08,245 --> 00:32:10,483
Skills won't tell anyone.
I promise.

543
00:32:10,885 --> 00:32:12,572
You don't understand.

544
00:32:12,608 --> 00:32:13,920
I got to go.

545
00:32:14,397 --> 00:32:16,581
But tonight, this, I mean...

546
00:32:16,616 --> 00:32:18,543
this was the start of
something really good.

547
00:32:18,578 --> 00:32:21,283
This was the start of us.
Can't you feel that?

548
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:22,690
I'm a Clean Teen.

549
00:32:23,056 --> 00:32:24,992
I'm the Clean Teen.

550
00:32:28,108 --> 00:32:29,622
I could love you.

551
00:32:32,647 --> 00:32:34,120
I know I could.

552
00:32:37,937 --> 00:32:39,371
But I can't.

553
00:32:41,317 --> 00:32:43,090
Then what was this?

554
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:52,393
This was goodbye.

555
00:32:56,927 --> 00:32:58,711
Shelly, please don't go.

556
00:32:59,837 --> 00:33:01,661
Mouth, don't call me.

557
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,530
If you really like me, just...

558
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:07,803
let me go.

559
00:33:28,638 --> 00:33:30,032
Thanks for a great evening.

560
00:33:30,066 --> 00:33:32,302
Oh, and thanks for letting
Lucas keep the tux.

561
00:33:32,335 --> 00:33:34,922
Oh, well, uh,
I had him try it on.

562
00:33:34,956 --> 00:33:36,341
It looks good on him.

563
00:33:36,427 --> 00:33:38,652
It's better than
those blue ruffles.

564
00:33:43,058 --> 00:33:44,532
Um, you know...

565
00:33:45,178 --> 00:33:47,051
I'm chaperoning at the prom.

566
00:33:47,088 --> 00:33:49,032
They still need
a couple parents.

567
00:33:50,527 --> 00:33:52,413
You're asking me to the prom?

568
00:33:54,595 --> 00:33:56,731
Yeah, I guess I am.

569
00:34:01,597 --> 00:34:02,872
Okay.

570
00:34:17,408 --> 00:34:19,403
I thought you said
you wanted to wait.

571
00:34:20,237 --> 00:34:22,992
Do you remember what you said
the last time we were here?

572
00:34:23,915 --> 00:34:26,403
You said you wanted
it all, and...

573
00:34:26,877 --> 00:34:28,400
I walked away.

574
00:34:31,148 --> 00:34:34,533
I made a big mistake that night
'cause all I wanted was sex.

575
00:34:35,096 --> 00:34:36,800
What do you want now?

576
00:34:37,746 --> 00:34:39,692
Now I want what you wanted.

577
00:34:41,027 --> 00:34:43,092
I want everything with you.

578
00:35:16,138 --> 00:35:19,313
There he is.
Big night, dawg, big night!

579
00:35:19,348 --> 00:35:21,263
So, how you feel?

580
00:35:22,147 --> 00:35:25,591
Well, I lost my virginity,
my prom date,

581
00:35:25,628 --> 00:35:28,922
and a girl I really
could have loved...

582
00:35:28,955 --> 00:35:30,530
all in one night.

583
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,502
To tell you the
truth, Skills...

584
00:35:35,218 --> 00:35:36,822
I never felt worse.

585
00:35:50,558 --> 00:35:51,873
Where's the new boyfriend?

586
00:35:52,197 --> 00:35:53,720
Taking a break.

587
00:35:53,828 --> 00:35:55,533
When all you do is kiss,

588
00:35:55,566 --> 00:35:57,860
you got to come up for
air once in a while.

589
00:35:58,306 --> 00:36:00,663
Well, he seems like a
really good guy -- Chase.

590
00:36:01,165 --> 00:36:02,363
Yeah, he is.

591
00:36:03,407 --> 00:36:05,082
I really like him.

592
00:36:05,258 --> 00:36:06,312
Good.

593
00:36:12,246 --> 00:36:15,710
Listen, I'm really sorry about Haley
and the whole tutor-center thing.

594
00:36:15,746 --> 00:36:17,893
Don't be sorry.
It's not like it was your fault.

595
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:20,673
Yeah.

596
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:25,753
So, how come you're not in
there enjoying your big party?

597
00:36:25,786 --> 00:36:29,173
Well, Skills broke out the
old Ravens' game footage.

598
00:36:30,057 --> 00:36:31,600
I swear, when I watch it,

599
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:33,362
it doesn't even feel like me.

600
00:36:33,396 --> 00:36:35,002
I should hope not.

601
00:36:35,038 --> 00:36:36,963
You were such a jerk!

602
00:36:36,997 --> 00:36:39,790
You were dating Peyton,
and you guys fought all the time.

603
00:36:39,826 --> 00:36:42,233
Hey, look who's talking.

604
00:36:42,946 --> 00:36:44,891
Are you ever going to
let Peyton off the mat?

605
00:36:47,368 --> 00:36:48,443
Yeah.

606
00:36:50,737 --> 00:36:52,880
I guess it's about time,
isn't it?

607
00:36:53,855 --> 00:36:55,943
Yeah, actually, it is.

608
00:36:56,497 --> 00:36:57,563
Don't move.

609
00:36:57,645 --> 00:36:58,852
Why?

610
00:37:00,436 --> 00:37:04,483
Nathan, what --
what's going on?

611
00:37:05,487 --> 00:37:06,761
The sprinklers.

612
00:37:07,228 --> 00:37:08,351
What?!

613
00:37:11,725 --> 00:37:14,322
You think you're funny?
You are so dead!

614
00:37:18,398 --> 00:37:20,652
Oh, I got you,
I got you, I got you.

615
00:37:21,955 --> 00:37:25,653
If you could go back and change
just one thing about your life,

616
00:37:26,296 --> 00:37:27,573
would you?

617
00:37:33,498 --> 00:37:35,003
And if you did...

618
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:38,313
would that change make
your life better?

619
00:38:14,646 --> 00:38:17,560
Or would that change
ultimately break your heart?

620
00:38:24,795 --> 00:38:26,843
Or break the heart of another?

621
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:50,743
Would you choose an
entirely different path?

622
00:38:56,578 --> 00:38:58,983
Or would you change
just one thing?

623
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:01,140
Just one moment?

624
00:39:02,476 --> 00:39:05,500
One moment that you
always wanted back?

625
00:39:16,747 --> 00:39:18,770
Oh, my god. Is that Nathan?!

626
00:39:18,808 --> 00:39:20,241
Is that Haley?!

627
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:21,781
I think it's Peyton.

628
00:39:32,817 --> 00:39:34,563
What's going on out there?

629
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:36,791
Dude, you got to see this!

630
00:39:36,825 --> 00:39:39,451
There's a tape of Peyton
having sex with Nathan!

631
00:39:39,486 --> 00:39:41,060
Oh, my god!

632
00:39:49,727 --> 00:39:50,901
Shut it off!

633
00:39:51,607 --> 00:39:53,112
Shut it off!

634
00:40:05,557 --> 00:40:07,882
Come on.
I can't believe I'm doing this.

635
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:13,043
Don't worry.
Nobody will ever know.

636
00:40:27,745 --> 00:40:32,110
