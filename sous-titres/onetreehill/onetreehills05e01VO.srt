<i>lucas: sometimes,it feels like it was yesterday -</i>

<i>graduating high school, saying goodbye.</i>

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,380
<i>that feeling that you get at 17 or 18</i>

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,240
<i>that nobody in the history of the world</i>

8
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,560

12

Okay. We're not gonna do this.

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,960
We're not gonna get sad. Nothing's gonna change now.

14
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,860
We'll all be friends forever.

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,250
I know it.

16
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,540
Look,in four years, we're gonna be right back here.

17
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,860
You know,done with college or wherever we go.

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,190
Right?

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,490
Yeah.

20
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,920

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,310

22
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,350
<I>it feels like someone else's memory.</I>

23
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:04,740
Four years later

24
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,380
Nathan: where did he get the hoop?

25
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,800
His uncle lucas gave it to him.

26
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,900
I don't want him playing.

27
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,070
Nathan,he's 4 years old. All he wants to do is be like his dad.

28
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,290
Why don't you go out there and show him -

29
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,250
I said i don't want him playing.

30
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,580
Jamie,come on,sweetie. Mama's got to go to work.

31
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,730
Good morning,clothes over bro's. Please hold.

32
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,620
Can you call prime and make a dinner reservation,please?

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,140
Make sure i get the table in the wine room.

34
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,770
Any night next week will do.

35
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,700
Um,you're booked every night next week.

36
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,860
Okay,then the week after. This looks great.

37
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,650
Can we make this about a quarter-Inch wider? Great.

38
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,690
And we've got to send something funny with a card

39
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,540
To conan o'brien.

40
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,160
Cheese. He likes cheese.

41
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,900
You want me to send conan o'brien cheese?

42
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,680
Manchego. No,send gouda.

43
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,620
Gouda's a funnier cheese, and don't forget to remind me

44
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,910
About the conference call with macy's.

45
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,540
Guys.

46
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,860
Absolutely not.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,280
There is no way she gets on the cover of my magazine

48
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,880
Unless she gains 10 pounds, minimum.

49
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,400
She looks unhealthy.

50
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,430
We were just brainstorming.

51
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,950
Brainstorm better. Anorexia is a disease.

52
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,500
It is not a fashion statement.

53
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,150
What do i smell?

54
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,940
Um,it's your coffee. Mocha double latte,extra foam.

55
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,390
Is there foam? Last time there was no foam. I like foam.

56
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,360
Extra foam.

57
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,780
Okay. What time is the premiere?

58
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,060
8:00, red carpet at 6:00.

59
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,130
I'm gonna do the red carpet and then skip the movie.

60
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,090
Let's call one of the nicks

61
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,580
And find out if they'd like to go.

62
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,740
Okay, which knick do you prefer?

63
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,480
There's stephon marbury, jamal crawford...

64
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,850
Oh,david lee is really cute.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,900
Not the new york knicks, you goof.

66
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,650
The nicks - Nick lachey, nick zano,nick reid.

67
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,830
Whoever.

68
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,440
And tell victoria to wait for me in the limo.

69
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,840
She's not gonna like that.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,670
Well,she works for me.

71
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,270
Oh,i must have the wrong office.

72
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,760
No,that's me - John knight,label president.

73
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,100
Last i knew, you were peyton sawyer,

74
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,480
Assistant to the assistant of the label president,

75
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,500
And your desk was - Where is your desk?

76
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,040
I'm sorry,i was just arranging your trades

77
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,180
And delivering the online download report,

78
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,170
Updating your call sheet, and admiring your view.

79
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,730
Also,mr. Knight,i have a couple unsigned bands

80
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,110
That i would really love for you to hear.

81
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,490
Peyton,i'm losing my hair, i'm hung over,

82
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,800
I have two different alimony payments due

83
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,160
And seven lines ringing.

84
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,030
Of course.

85
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,230
Sawyer?

86
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,680
Yes.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,530
You look good.

88
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,690
Drop a button on that top and i'll let you sit in

89
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,790
On the morning new-Music session.

90
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,930
One button, one song.

91
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,730
And get me some aspirin.

92
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,770
Man,they do grow up fast.

93
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,160
Uncle lucas!

94
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,660
J. Luke!

95
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,190
Hey.

96
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,860
You in high school already?

97
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,110
No,i'm only 4.

98
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,830
Hmm,4 going on 40.

99
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,030
What you drawing?

100
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,790
You can't see it. It's not done.

101
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,850
Yeah,trust me, i understand that one.

102
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,020
I take it the writing's not going l?

103
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,890
The writing... is not going at all.

104
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,140
How about you? How was the last day of student teaching?

105
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:19,870
Great.

106
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,640
Trying not to freak out about next week when it's just me.

107
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,600
You're gonna be great, hales.

108
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,930
Did you get a nanny yet?

109
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,230
No,not yet.

110
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,730
Well,you know,you can't babysit him forever,hales.

111
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,020
And by him,i mean nathan, not jamie.

112
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,390
Well,it's only been four months,so...

113
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,460
<I>announcer: seattle is on the clock right now.</I>

114
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,960
<I>we'll get to the commissioner coming up</i>

115
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,250
<I>in regards to their pick.</I>

116
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,360
<I>they going big? They going small?</I>

117
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,270
<I>it's been unpredictable so far.</I>

118
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,700
<I>here's the commissioner.</I>

119
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,530
<I>man: with the 10th pick in the nba draft,</i>

120
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,680
<I>the seattle sonics select...</i>

121
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,530
We're moving to seattle, mama!

122
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,710
It's gonna be seattle.

123
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,570
My agent just called. He said we got a guarantee -

124
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,100
I'm going 10th pick to the sonics!

125
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,670
Oh,baby, i'm so proud of you!

126
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,130
You have worked so hard for the last four years!

127
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,210
You believed in it,and now it's actually happening!

128
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,240
Why are we buying a house in tree hill

129
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,020
If we're moving to seattle?

130
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,150
We should buy a house there.

131
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,820
Oh,we're going to. A big one.

132
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,780
With a pool?

133
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,350
More like a moat and a drawbridge.

134
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,060
And a dragon?

135
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,750
Yes,and a pet dragon for jim-Jam.

136
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,740
Hales,we're gonna have all kinds of houses,

137
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,860
But tree hill is home.

138
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,030
And,besides, this isn't even my salary.

139
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,830
This is just shoe-Contract money.

140
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,720
It's money from the shoe,mama! Let's get it!

141
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,530
Oh,baby,i don't know.

142
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,880
The little man's spoken.

143
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,410
And he's right. We should get the house,hales.

144
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,880
You know why? Why?

145
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,560
Because we did it together. We made it happen.

146
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,600
And we're gonna have to get used to the fact

147
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,370
That this is what life's like when your dreams come true.

148
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,420
The tar heels land another blue chip prospect,

149
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,770
And we've got the scoop.

150
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,560

00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,840
Junk: pass it,pass it,pass it! Pass the ball!

152
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,830
Yeah,he is. He's passing it to my guy.

153
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,060
Can you guys keep it down? I'm working on my demo.

154
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,550
For what? A job.

155
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,970
I'm gonna send audition tapes to all the local stations.

156
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,900
Sorry,mouth. Go ahead,man,do your thing.

157
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,890
The tar heels land another blue chip prospect,

158
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,180
And we've got the scoop.

159
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:34,750
I'm marvin mcfadden -

160
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,190
No,no,no,no,no,no!

161
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,450
That's how you go down the lane!

162
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,350
Sorry. Sorry.

163
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,800
The tar heels land another blue chip prospect,

164
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,180
And we've got the scoop.

165
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,690
Pizza!

166
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,310
I'll pause it.

167
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,650
Junk and fergie play video games,drink beer,

168
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,850
And eat pizza.

169
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,850
I'm mouth mcfadden, and i'm still unemployed.

170
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,420
So,six months ago when they asked us to fix this mess,

171
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,040
What the hell were we thinking saying yes?

172
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,660
Well,well,well, if it isn't skills taylor,

173
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,260
New assistant head coach of the tree hill raiders.

174
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,560
Hey, if you could afford me...

175
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,780
So,how great is this,huh?

176
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,040
Lucas scott,head coach. Local boy makes good.

177
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,450
Local boys made good.

178
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,970
You're a big part of this, skills.

179
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,660
I hope so. Man,we blew this place up.

180
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:33,700
Hey,how many games they won

181
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,920
Since we hung that state championship banner?

182
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,520
Not many.

183
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,680
But i do know one thing - Losing's over.

184
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,370
Oh,no doubt.

185
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,900
She's got a hit tv show.

186
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,500
Great potential for crossover marketing and promo.

187
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,880
But the songs are terrible.

188
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,460
John,she's young, she's hot,

189
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,760
And her social life's a train wreck.

190
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,560
We could ship this thing platinum.

191
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,830
Um,i have a band.

192
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,630
Well,why not? It can't get any worse.

193
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,890
Okay,well,they're called low versus diamond,

194
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,220
And they've already built a strong internet following,

195
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,480
And the songs are great.

196
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,140
We'll go with the actress.

197
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,020
All right?

198
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,720
Why don't you go get us some lunch menus?

199
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,140
Ladies and gentlemen, the n.S. 23.

200
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:22,610
Let's see it. Barry,thank you so much.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seattle's gonna be drafting a hell of a player,nate.

202
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,240
Baby,it's awesome. I have to go relieve the sitter.

203
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,810
But you guys should stay and celebrate.

204
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,480
It's the night before the draft.

205
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,930
You sure? Yeah.

206
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,220
Thank you guys!

207
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,230
Hey,no driving tonight, okay?

208
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,040
Take the limo and get the car tomorrow.

209
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,760
I promise. Okay.

210
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:45,710
Hook it up.

211
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,770
Check it out.

212
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,990
Lucas: "and like the river court signatures

213
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:00,820
"Of their younger selves, weathered now,faded.

214
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,700
So,too,were they."

215
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,820
"I...

216
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,070
...suck."

217
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:29,720
Tell me you are writing the best pages of your life.

218
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,550
Well,hi to you,too.

219
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,320
If not the best pages of your life,

220
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,680
At least a bunch of okay pages?

221
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,770
I've written a few sentences.

222
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,120
Uh-Huh.

223
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,630
And deleted them because they sucked.

224
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,150
Luke,this is serious.

225
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,770
I can't be your editor if i don't have anything to edit.

226
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,080
My butt is on the line here.

227
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,780
Tell me you have something, anything.

228
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,350
Uhh... lindsey?

229
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,150
Luke?

230
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,030
I don't know. You know, i think it's an earthquake.

231
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,700
Lucas scott!

232
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,100
Somebody needs to do something about the paparazzi.

233
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,600
They're totally out of control.

234
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,790
We pay them a lot of money to talk about the brand.

235
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,890
I hope you were nice. I was nice.

236
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,510
Nick, did you enjoy yourself?

237
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,870
I did. I thought the movie was -

238
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,920
Driver,can you pull over, please?

239
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm sorry,darling. You were saying?

240
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,620
Nothing. I liked the movie.

241
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,470
Thank you very much,

242
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,730
And enjoy the rest of your evening.

243
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,430
Right. Okay.

244
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,200
I just - I just thought that maybe...

245
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,530
Yes,we know what you thought,nick.

246
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,060
You thought you'd have your way with my designer.

247
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,920
A little fondling, a little tongue-Kissing,

248
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,410
Something a little dirty but not too freaky.

249
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,400
Uh,no, i just thought that -

250
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,400
It's clothes over bro's, nick.

251
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,330
We want the tabloids to think that she's sleeping with you.

252
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,430
She's not actually sleeping with you. We're all set.

253
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,530
Call me!

254
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,460
Taxi!

255
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,480
You are unbelievably rude.

256
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,650
Well,it's been a long day. But tomorrow's even longer.

257
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,200
You have a 9:00 a.M. Interview about taking the company public.

258
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,590
I'll be there for the finer points.

259
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,890
You just need to look beautiful and talk about your passion

260
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,720
And your creativity and blah,blah,blah.

261
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,780
And i've made a change to the model lineup

262
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,120
Due to the additional scrutiny from the press.

263
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,010
Oh,but you forgot -

264
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,400
She's not on the list.

265
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,090
She's my friend.

266
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,570
She's not your friend.

267
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,810
She's an employee.

268
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,070
I'm not sure i'm comfortable with that.

269
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:04,020
Brooke,clothes over bro's is a multimillion dollar company.

270
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:04,940
Yeah.

271
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,280
A company that you've entrusted to me

272
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,110
To make executive decisions like these.

273
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,600
We have to cut her loose.

274
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,900
You're gonna fire her?

275
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,420
No,i'm not gonnfire her. You're gonna fire her.

276
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,100
It's your company,my dear. I just work here.

277
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,360
Hey,it's me.

278
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,170
It's not gonna work out for the fashion show.

279
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,800
No,it's actually not gonna work out at all.

280
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,660
I'm gonna have to let you go.

281
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,970
It's nothing personal. It's just business. I got to go.

282
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,570
Postcard for jamie scott!

283
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,210
Another one? Yeah,man.

284
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,200
Where are they now?

285
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,290
Well,aunt karen and cousin lily are in ireland.

286
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,730
Now,that's right across the irish sea from england.

287
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,900
You remember where england is?

288
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,020
The one with the clock!

289
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,830
You are a genius. Are you sure you're not my kid?

290
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,440
All right.

291
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,810
You think we'll ever see them again?

292
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,320
Oh,yeah,of course we will,man.

293
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,620
So,listen.

294
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,690
I'm gonna go talk to your dad, and then we'll go,okay?

295
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,590
Okay. All right.

296
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,370
Haley keeps the alcohol out of reach.

297
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,010
At least,she tries.

298
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,270
It's a little early, don't you think?

299
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,690
So,how's physical therapy going?

300
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,940
How's your second book coming?

301
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,720
Ouch.

302
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,660
So,you know,haley told me that the doctors say

303
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,860
You'll be up on your feet any day now.

304
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,190
Pretty lucky,nate.

305
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,840
Oh,yeah,that's me. Mr. Lucky.

306
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,930
I'm just saying you'll be back to normal in no time.

307
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,720
Luke,i'm never gonna play basketball again.

308
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,030
That's not exactly normal,okay?

309
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,190
Luke,damn it! Don't be a dick,all right?

310
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,930
You want it? Walk over here and get it.

311
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,700
Why don't i walk over there and kick your ass,huh?

312
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,800
Kicking. Kicking's good. Let's see it.

313
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,040
Give me that bottle right now,

314
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,850
Or dan's not gonna be the only scott to kill his brother.

315
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,990
James: ready,uncle lucas?

316
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,900
Real nice,nate.

317
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,530
Luke...

318
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,460
Come on,jamie. Let's go.

319
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,240
Bye,daddy.

320
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,600
Bye-Bye.

321
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,790
So,none of you guys know who ate my pizza?

322
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,860
Nah,man.

323
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,530
Amazing. So,my pizza just ate itself.

324
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,510
Hey,i was working on my audition reel.

325
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,810
Hey,that's good. 'Cause you owe me for the rent.

326
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,410
And you two knuckleheads owe me for a pizza.

327
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,590
There he is!

328
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,910
Big game james. Hey,yo,big game.

329
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,120
I got something for you.

330
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,430
Cool!

331
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,980
You want to try it on?

332
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,720
All right.

333
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,840
Put your arms through, and there we go.

334
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,990
It's perfect!

335
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,800
Let's see what you got, baller.

336
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,870
Darn it,uncle skills, you always do that.

337
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,390
You ever gonna let him score?

338
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,710
Shorty shouldn't be in the paint. He got to learn.

339
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,300
Dude,he's 4.

340
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,250
What do you think, sawyer?

341
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,150
I think you were right about the act we signed today.

342
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,760
Her songs blow. So why'd you sign her?

343
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,550
How long have you been in los angeles,peyton? From...

344
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,640
From tree hill,north carolina. Four years.

345
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,970
Four years. Why'd you come?

346
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,920
I wanted to discover

347
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,510
And sign bands that could change someone's life,

348
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,140
Like the bands that changed mine.

349
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,990
I figured you were one of them.

350
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,480
I used to be,too.

351
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,770
Then i figured it out.

352
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,870
<I>it's called show business for a reason.</I>

353
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,230
We're here to make money.

354
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,680
Even if the product sucks.

355
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,590
Especially if the product sucks.

356
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,970
I hate to be the one to break it to you,

357
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,560
But rock 'n' roll can't actually save the world.

358
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,850
See,i disagree.

359
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,120
Walk into any club on the strip tonight

360
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,420
And just look at the kids, look into their eyes.

361
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,400
They're all looking for something to believe in.

362
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,360
I think that music can be the thing that changes their world.

363
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,440
That is why you are still the assistant to the assistant.

364
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,610
They're not out there to get their world saved.

365
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,760
They had a bad day.

366
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:20,560
They went out to get drunk and get laid.

367
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,330
Peyton,you're as smart and as talented

368
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,540
As anyone at the label,but you'd be so much further along

369
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,880
If you could just accept the business side of what we do

370
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,000
And play the game.

371
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,640
I'm just not really interested in playing the game.

372
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,840
You already did.

373
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,760
You dropped a button to get into that meeting.

374
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,980
Drop a few more,they'll probably give you my job.

375
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,880
Well,i will have your job one day,john.

376
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,750
Just not that way.

377
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:58,050
Have fun in the clubs tonight,

378
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,420
Assistant to the assistant.

379
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,980
<I>substitution for the clippers. J. Luke.</I>

380
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,700
Down by 2,and it looks like they're bringing in a rookie.

381
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,130
Clock running down, time for one last play.

382
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,430
All right,jamie, this is what we're gonna do.

383
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,890
When i tell you,i want you to hit the green button. Okay?

384
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,020
Don't do it,jamie. Pass it to your pal junk.

385
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,990
Kid's got the ball clock running down.

386
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,970
Jamie, i'll give you ice cream.

387
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,910
Shoot it!

388
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,290
No,no,no,no,no!

389
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,080
Oh!Oh! Oh!Oh!

390
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,860
That's it, you lost the ice cream.

391
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,560
Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh!

392
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,200
Jamie! Oh,oh,oh!

393
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,590
Hi, upside-Down boy.

394
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,210
Hey,mama! We won!

395
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,390
Oh,wow. We were just...

396
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,490
Oh! Here you go.

397
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,450
What are you wearing?

398
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,880
Uncle skills gave it to me.

399
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,400
Well,wasn't that nice of him, making you look all krunk.

400
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,530
Did you say thank you?

401
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,550
Mm-Hmm.

402
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,110
Uh-Huh.

403
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,670
Okay,go say goodbye to the guys.

404
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,300
So,look,i kind of gave nathan some grief today

405
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,390
About not being on his feet yet.

406
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,380
Oh,well,you know,i know he's a little dark right now.

407
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,510
You got to push him, hales.

408
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,160
????

409
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,490
Okay,mom,i'm ready.

410
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,540
Okay.

411
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,240
Whoa, what about me,jamie?

412
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,300
Bye,uncle lucas.

413
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,840
Oh,bye,buddy. I love you.

414
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,550
I got to go home now, and anyway,

415
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,030
You should be writing.

416
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,040
I don't want to hear it.

417
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,330
So,we caught up with brooke davis,

418
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,500
Young,hot designer of clothes over bro's.

419
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,150
Now,brooke, let me ask you this.

420
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,370
Do you ever miss just being young?

421
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,470
I am young.

422
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,150
But acting young.

423
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,590
Not being the boss of this huge corporation,

424
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,000
But being brooke davis, 21-Year-Old girl?

425
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,510
Sure,i miss it.

426
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,070
Thank you. We have to move on.

427
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,730
Clothes over bro's is my dream come true.

428
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,980
This is what i wished for.

429
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,690
Oh,baby...

430
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:12,800
Why don't you go upstairs? I'll be up in a minute,okay?

431
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,090
I can't.

432
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:36,490
We can't be like this,nathan.

433
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,820
Your son needs you.

434
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,260
Please don't become your father.

435
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,460
Nathan: my father is in prison.

436
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,020
So am i.

437
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,400
Well, you can walk out.

438
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,190
Lucas on recording: chapter three.

439
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,670
Peyton sawyer is destined for greatness.

440
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,040
Actually,she's already great,

441
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,270
Because peyton sawyer has a thing called integrity,

442
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,180
And nothing or no one is ever going to change that.

443
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,030
I remember the first time i met her.

444
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,340
<I>you have 47 messages.</I>

445
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,100
<I>all messages deleted.</I>

446
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:42,280
Hi. It's peyton.

447
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,450
Yeah,i'm sorry. I know it's late there,i just -

448
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,170
What happened to us, you know?

449
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,320
I don't know who i am anymore.

450
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,700
Or how i got here.

451
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,190
I miss who i used to be.

452
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,430
I want to have a home again, you know?

453
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,630
And real friends.

454
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:38,190
You know,

455
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,210
The kind of friendships we used to believe in.

456
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,520
I miss that.

457
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,690
And i miss you.

458
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,570
I guess i just miss all of it.

459
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,230
No,i have the uncorrected proofs.

460
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,770
I need the corrected ones.

461
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,430
Okay,i have to go.

462
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,130
Thanks. Bye.

463
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,680
Hi.

464
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,390
Look,before you start yelling at me,i'm sorry.

465
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,800
I know i've missed my deadline again,

466
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,980
And i know you have a lot of people to answer to,

467
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,760
And it's not fair to you.

468
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,190
I remember the first time i read it.

469
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,090
I was a junior editor, just out of college,

470
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,160
Missing my friends.

471
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:40,870
I took two dozen manuscripts home for the weekend,

472
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,400
Just like i did every weekend, hoping that this time,

473
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,290
Something would speak to me.

474
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,200
And it did.

475
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,350
It was a great first novel,luke.

476
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,480
It brought you to me.

477
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,070
But a writer's career is about a body of work.

478
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,840
It's about the second book and the third and the fourth.

479
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,570
Lindsey -

480
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,760
It's been two years.

481
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:09,450
And that wouldn't scare me if i thought you were writing,

482
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,560
But you're not.

483
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,830
So what am i supposed to do,luke?

484
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,600
Well,you could give me a little bit more time

485
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,510
Because i'm handsome.

486
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,600
Close the door,luke.

487
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,630
Not being the boss of this huge corporation

488
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,720
But being brooke davis, 21-Year-Old girl.

489
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,670
That is not the face of a happy girl

490
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,130
Who got everything she wished for.

491
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,070
A lot of things, but not everything.

492
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,340
Well,are you counting the trip to milan?

493
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,710
The trip for work. Come on.

494
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,080
Let's see the face of a girl who gets to go to italy tomorrow

495
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,910
To approve the textiles for her fall line.

496
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,070
But it's not everything.

497
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,160
<I>no,dear. It is everything.</I>

498
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,350
And if you've lost sight of that,

499
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:02,430
You have lost your way, brooke davis.

500
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:05,270
Milan,tomorrow.

501
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,880
Smile.

502
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,790
Okay. Let's do lunch.

503
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,350
Sawyer!

504
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,000
What's the name of that sushi place i like?

505
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,310
You were wrong yesterday

506
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,660
When you said the kids in the clubs

507
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,140
Were just there for decadence.

508
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:34,860
I think it's more like romance and hope and inspiration

509
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,210
And that feeling that you get

510
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,250
When other human beings pick up basic instruments

511
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,820
And make sense of your world.

512
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:46,370
And the day that i think it's just about making money

513
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,120
Is gonna be the day

514
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,290
That i've betrayed everything i believe in about music

515
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,230
And life and myself.

516
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,690
Was that a sushi place?

517
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:06,000
I quit,john. I'm going home.

518
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,690
You're making a mistake.

519
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,490
No. I'm fixing one.

520
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,270
I think you drink too much.

521
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,580
I think you're right.

522
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,410
Haley: jamie,come on.

523
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,480
Hey,come on.

524
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,940
Okay,your boarding pass and itinerary are in your bag.

525
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,850
The car service will pick you up in milan.

526
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,350
If you have any problems, i gave you my home,cell,

527
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,380
And parents' house number.

528
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:26,070
Millicent,you are a great assistant,okay?

529
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,160
Try and have some fun while i'm gone.

530
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,690
You're only young once.

Too late,seattle boy.

563
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,750
You should have left with that fat-Ass wife.

Oh,my god. Nate. Nate,you all right?

565

Two years.

580
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,880
It's been longer than that.

581
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,410
God,luke,i missed you.

582
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,680
I have someone.

Postseason hardball, preseason hoops,

585
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,690

00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,040
What happened to us, you know?

590
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,870
I don't know who i am anymore.

591
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,910
Or how i got here.

592
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,830
Lindsey: hey,you.

Hey.

Sorry about yesterday.

596
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,040
It's just,they only agreed to let me split time here

597
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:24,500
Because i promised them i'd get you back on track.

598
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,470
I know. It's okay.

599
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,610
I still love you.

I want to have a home again, you know?

603
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,690
I miss that.

604
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,060
I miss you.

605
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,590
Jamie.

606
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,240
Son...

607
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,960
Daddy's sorry, for everything.

608
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,300
Come here.

609
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,340
I guess i miss all of it.

610
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:50,190
Does any of that make any sense?

611
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,130
That makes all the sense in the world,peyton.

612
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,160
Four years ago,it all seemed so clear,didn't it?

613
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,130
Conquer the world, save the world,

614
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:07,040
Live happily ever after.

615
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,320
Are you happy,brooke?

616
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,420
Sometimes.

617
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,870
Not always. Are you?

618
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,430
No.

619
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,510
Okay. Then let me ask you something.

620
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,970
What is gonna make you happy,peyton?

621
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,620
Is it how you look or the car you drive

622
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,800
Or the people you know?

623
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:31,070
Is it money or celebrity or power or accomplishment?

624
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,460
Because i have all those things,

625
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:37,050
And - And i don't think it's enough.

626
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,870
Well,then,what is?

627
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,350
Love,i think.

628
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,140
And that love can be for a boy or a girl

629
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:56,770
Or a place or a way of life or even for a family.

630
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:59,790
But where you find it is up to you.

631
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:03,840
So where are you gonna find that love,peyton?

632
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,540
I think i need to go home.

633
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,980
I was hoping you'd say that.

634
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,990
I missed you, brooke davis.

635
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,710
I missed you, peyton sawyer.

636
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,350
We're home now. It's gonna be okay.

637
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,070
Come on.

638
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:33,980
