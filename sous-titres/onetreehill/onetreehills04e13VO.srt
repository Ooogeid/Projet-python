1
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,936
<i>You ever wonder how long
it takes to change your life?</i>

2
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:20,420
<i>What measure of time
is enough to be life-altering?</i>

3
00:00:23,305 --> 00:00:25,193
<i>Is it four years,
like high school?</i>

4
00:00:26,517 --> 00:00:27,390
<i>One year?</i>

5
00:00:28,057 --> 00:00:29,493
<i>An eight-week rock tour?</i>

6
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:33,448
<i>Can your life change in a month,</i>

7
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:36,434
<i>a week, or a single day?</i>

8
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:40,023
<i>We're always in a hurry--</i>

9
00:00:40,445 --> 00:00:41,319
<i>To grow up,</i>

10
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:43,873
<i>to go places, to get ahead.</i>

11
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:47,272
<i>But when you're young,</i>

12
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,025
<i>one hour...</i>

13
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,241
<i>can change everything.</i>

14
00:00:56,462 --> 00:00:58,212
How are we doing
this morning, seniors?

15
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:01,388
Anyone wake up with their clothes on
from the night before,

16
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:03,604
still drunk but strangely hungover?

17
00:01:05,313 --> 00:01:06,166
Anyone?

18
00:01:07,982 --> 00:01:09,301
Well, I guess that was just me.

19
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:13,926
Actually, last night was uno night

20
00:01:14,893 --> 00:01:15,869
at my house.

21
00:01:16,226 --> 00:01:19,259
And it was a bloodbath, but I care not
to discuss it with you right now.

22
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,479
So we won't.

23
00:01:23,236 --> 00:01:25,114
Let me ask you guys a question.

24
00:01:28,363 --> 00:01:30,016
Does today's class really matter,

25
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,932
or is just a 50-minute requirement

26
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:36,778
designed to get a grade so
you can go on to college or a job

27
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:38,584
and the rest of your lives?
Anyone?

28
00:01:39,926 --> 00:01:41,119
If we say yes,

29
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,358
can we have the grade and
go on to the rest of our lives?

30
00:01:47,787 --> 00:01:51,204
Mouth, using one word, describe
how your classmates see you.

31
00:01:54,055 --> 00:01:55,020
Awesome?

32
00:01:57,505 --> 00:01:58,818
Really? Okay.

33
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,834
Let's say that there are
five universal terms

34
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:04,868
that describe everyone in high school,

35
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:06,859
okay? Let's say "Jock".

36
00:02:07,887 --> 00:02:10,572
"Prom Queen".

37
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:15,853
"Geek".

38
00:02:19,545 --> 00:02:20,644
"Loner".

39
00:02:22,104 --> 00:02:22,973
And...

40
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:24,543
"Slut" ?

41
00:02:33,202 --> 00:02:36,160
Okay, considering that "awesome"
isn't a category, Shelly Simon,

42
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:37,882
describe Mouth in one word.

43
00:02:39,582 --> 00:02:41,418
Uh, I don't really know him, but...

44
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,878
..."nice", I guess.

45
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:48,430
''Nice''. I suppose we could
file ''nice'' under ''friendly''.

46
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:50,506
But since ''Friendly''
doesn't mean ''Friendly''

47
00:02:50,507 --> 00:02:51,727
that would make Mouth a slut.

48
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:53,697
You have four other choices.

49
00:02:58,667 --> 00:02:59,756
"Geek", I guess.

50
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:01,451
Geek.

51
00:03:02,235 --> 00:03:03,399
Join the club, Mouth.

52
00:03:03,991 --> 00:03:05,118
Okay, class.

53
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:07,236
Nathan-- Five choices.

54
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,400
"Jock".

55
00:03:08,452 --> 00:03:10,236
- Lucas.
- "Jock".

56
00:03:10,443 --> 00:03:12,246
- Brooke.
- "Prom Queen".

57
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,196
Rachel.

58
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,839
- "Friendly".
- Hey!

59
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:16,735
Peyton.

60
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:19,948
- "Prom Queen"
- Oh, come on. I am so a loner.

61
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:23,253
Right, a loner cheerleader
who's dating a jock.

62
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,319
No offense, but I'm a loner.

63
00:03:25,526 --> 00:03:26,934
You're a prom queen.

64
00:03:27,183 --> 00:03:28,863
Like it or not, you are

65
00:03:28,864 --> 00:03:31,408
who your classmates see you as.

66
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,098
But here's the good news.

67
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:34,601
That's gonna change soon.

68
00:03:35,155 --> 00:03:38,623
Because pretty soon you are going to
be going out into that big, wide world.

69
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,142
And you can erase,

70
00:03:42,095 --> 00:03:44,005
all those labels.

71
00:03:44,805 --> 00:03:47,472
Now, for some of you, shedding
this image is gonna be...

72
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:49,012
a great thing.

73
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,003
And for some of you...

74
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:52,984
not such a great thing.

75
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:57,089
But what matters is that
you know who you really are.

76
00:03:57,756 --> 00:04:00,019
And you know how you want
the world to see you.

77
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,062
Now, you've been together
for what, for four years?

78
00:04:04,922 --> 00:04:05,711
Haley...

79
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:08,378
What's Lucas' middle name?

80
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:09,778
Eugene.

81
00:04:10,107 --> 00:04:13,224
Oh! I'm sorry. I'm so, s--

82
00:04:13,694 --> 00:04:14,738
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:14,823 --> 00:04:16,522
Lucas, what's Glenda's last name?

84
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:22,026
I don't know.

85
00:04:23,932 --> 00:04:24,796
Sorry.

86
00:04:26,262 --> 00:04:27,734
Okay, everyone
on this side of the room,

87
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:30,673
I want you to write your name on a piece
of paper and put it in Nathan's hat.

88
00:04:30,808 --> 00:04:31,972
Okay? Hurry up.

89
00:04:32,451 --> 00:04:35,354
Everyone on this side of
the room is gonna draw a name.

90
00:04:36,312 --> 00:04:38,444
And the name that you draw

91
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:40,680
will be the person
that you will spend

92
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:43,206
the rest of the class with.

93
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:48,259
Maybe we'll find out
if 50 minutes can matter.

94
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:50,382
Okay, pass the hat around.

95
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,754
Shelly, who you got?

96
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:01,538
Mouth.

97
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:04,103
Karma's a funny thing, isn't it?

98
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:05,164
Haley?

99
00:05:05,624 --> 00:05:07,389
Uh, Skills... ington.

100
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,648
Rachel?

101
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:10,169
Bevin.

102
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:11,701
Glenda?

103
00:05:12,086 --> 00:05:13,391
Got to love karma.

104
00:05:14,143 --> 00:05:15,044
Lucas.

105
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:16,274
Laura?

106
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:18,305
Oh, I have Marion.

107
00:05:18,377 --> 00:05:19,185
Emma?

108
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:21,013
I've got Zack.

109
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:22,773
Michael?

110
00:05:23,487 --> 00:05:24,930
I got Betty.

111
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:26,135
Brooke?

112
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,982
Um, I have Chase.

113
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:31,714
Peyton?

114
00:05:37,134 --> 00:05:37,941
Nathan.

115
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:39,827
Okay, here's the deal.
Everyone pair up.

116
00:05:39,828 --> 00:05:41,941
You can leave the classroom,
but not the campus.

117
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:45,118
At the door, you'll find a camera.
I want each of you,

118
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:48,038
at the end of the class,
to take a picture of your partner.

119
00:05:48,155 --> 00:05:50,733
This picture represents
how you see them.

120
00:05:51,448 --> 00:05:54,828
That picture is going into the
yearbook for the rest of time.

121
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:58,237
Now, for some of you,
this is an opportunity

122
00:05:58,238 --> 00:06:00,218
to reinvent yourselves,
starting today.

123
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:04,130
Do we have to reinvent ourselves?

124
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:07,225
'Cause I think most of my
friends see me as fabulous.

125
00:06:08,109 --> 00:06:09,149
Maybe so,

126
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,687
but my friend Mr. Miller sees you
as the girl who's failing calculus.

127
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:16,872
Okay, everyone, grab a camera
and get out of here.

128
00:06:16,873 --> 00:06:17,983
Oh, one-one more thing,

129
00:06:17,984 --> 00:06:19,758
with the camera,
is a list of instructions.

130
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,475
So, at the end of the class
I want you to tell me

131
00:06:21,476 --> 00:06:23,032
what you learned about your partner.

132
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:25,390
You have 50 minutes. Go.

133
00:06:35,684 --> 00:06:38,115
Well, I guess you're stuck
with the geek.

134
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:40,510
Okay, Haley J.S.,
let me make a deal with you.

135
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:42,934
As long as you don't
give birth early, we good.

136
00:06:43,226 --> 00:06:44,270
I don't get it.

137
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:47,359
- I'm Lucas.
- Scott. Right.

138
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,516
At least I know your last name.

139
00:06:49,703 --> 00:06:51,359
So this is kind of like
the boy toy auction,

140
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,899
only without the kissing
and partial nudity.

141
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,301
The hour is still young.

142
00:06:55,268 --> 00:06:57,969
Um, so about this whole
calculus thing, I--

143
00:07:04,288 --> 00:07:05,096
Glenda.

144
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:06,711
Glenda.

145
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,627
I'm sorry about
not knowing your name.

146
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,595
Could we just do the assignment?

147
00:07:16,243 --> 00:07:18,478
All right, look, first thing
on the list-- It's, uh...

148
00:07:19,512 --> 00:07:21,494
"Share something personal
with your partner".

149
00:07:22,686 --> 00:07:23,503
Farrell.

150
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:25,296
My last name's Farrell.

151
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:27,373
Is that personal enough for you?

152
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:36,398
Will you just listen to me, please?

153
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:38,520
So, what? You accidentally
forgot to tell me

154
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:41,873
you were failing calculus when
you started tutoring me, in calculus?

155
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,198
How did you get that "A"
I saw on your test, anyways?

156
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,358
It's complicated. Trust me.

157
00:07:47,997 --> 00:07:48,883
Trust you?

158
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,867
I already did that.
Now I find out that

159
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:55,089
my tutor is doing worse
in calculus than I am.

160
00:07:56,618 --> 00:07:57,970
It's a long story, okay?

161
00:07:58,318 --> 00:08:00,046
Well, don't tell me
another story, Brooke.

162
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:01,418
Tell me the truth.

163
00:08:02,306 --> 00:08:04,061
Or is that even possible for you to do?

164
00:08:06,856 --> 00:08:07,664
Okay.

165
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:11,054
Come on.

166
00:08:12,374 --> 00:08:14,345
You know, you shouldn't judge
people like that.

167
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:16,915
You called me a geek.

168
00:08:18,196 --> 00:08:19,844
It was the only category that fit.

169
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,953
- I called you "nice" first.
- Well, how do you know I'm nice?

170
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:24,090
Maybe I'm not nice.

171
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:25,789
I see that.

172
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:30,936
We're supposed to tell each other
something personal.

173
00:08:32,298 --> 00:08:33,604
Like, uh...

174
00:08:34,123 --> 00:08:37,088
My middle name is Leonardo,
after my grandpa Leo.

175
00:08:38,846 --> 00:08:40,444
I guess that's kind of geeky.

176
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:44,940
Wow. You really got personal there.

177
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:48,227
Well, it's not like you're gonna tell me
anything real, either, right?

178
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:49,875
It's just an assignment.

179
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:57,499
Before I started clean teens,

180
00:08:59,151 --> 00:09:02,338
I was in a serious relationship
with this guy I met at summer camp.

181
00:09:03,838 --> 00:09:06,168
It was pretty intense, and then...

182
00:09:07,568 --> 00:09:09,842
We couldn't see each other
for the rest of the summer.

183
00:09:10,614 --> 00:09:13,117
My parents, they wouldn't let me
talk to him or...

184
00:09:13,624 --> 00:09:14,599
anything.

185
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:19,710
But I knew I'd see him when we
got back to school in the fall.

186
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:22,697
And...

187
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:26,077
The night before we got back,
I couldn't sleep.

188
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,247
This is the spot I was standing in
when I finally saw him again...

189
00:09:38,902 --> 00:09:40,367
With his new girlfriend.

190
00:09:42,376 --> 00:09:44,179
He looked at me, you know? He--

191
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:46,883
He looked right at me,
and then he just...

192
00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:48,677
walked away, without a word.

193
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:52,094
It was just over.

194
00:09:57,136 --> 00:09:59,098
That's the moment
I thought of clean teens.

195
00:10:03,032 --> 00:10:04,046
But,

196
00:10:04,807 --> 00:10:07,896
like you said, it's not like I'm
actually gonna tell you anything real.

197
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:18,610
Okay. Pregnant girl on the roof.

198
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,835
Come on, now, man.
We had a deal--

199
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:22,892
- No early deliveries.
- Right.

200
00:10:22,893 --> 00:10:25,756
Check it out. You're gonna love
this view. It's the shiznit.

201
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,719
This view really is the shiznit.

202
00:10:31,888 --> 00:10:33,804
You see that factory, way out there?

203
00:10:34,796 --> 00:10:37,496
My pops been working there
since he graduated Tree Hill--

204
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:40,945
Six days a week, on second shift.

205
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:45,483
So we're supposed to tell each
other something personal, right?

206
00:10:46,657 --> 00:10:47,465
Yeah.

207
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:50,892
Well, here's mine.

208
00:10:51,936 --> 00:10:53,777
There's a job waiting
on me in that place

209
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:55,795
if I don't get a scholarship to college.

210
00:10:56,847 --> 00:10:58,565
That's not gonna happen, Skills.

211
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,238
I can feel it.

212
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,623
- I'm glad you're so sure.
- No, the baby's kicking.

213
00:11:04,624 --> 00:11:05,966
I can feel it-- Here.

214
00:11:09,348 --> 00:11:10,437
It's like a step show.

215
00:11:12,032 --> 00:11:13,811
Something personal, right?

216
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:14,943
Yeah.

217
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,488
So I guess I was right
about the partial-nudity thing.

218
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:22,613
Boys' locker room?

219
00:11:22,614 --> 00:11:24,290
I'm just following the assignment.

220
00:11:25,037 --> 00:11:26,401
See this bench press?

221
00:11:27,168 --> 00:11:30,188
This summer, I had decided to really
dedicate myself to basketball.

222
00:11:30,926 --> 00:11:33,716
My dad told me that I was way
too skinny to ever be a great player.

223
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,370
He said I wasn't tough enough
and I wasn't strong enough.

224
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:37,926
So to prove him wrong,

225
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:40,197
I spent every single day
in this weight room.

226
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,254
It was like 1,000 degrees in here,
but I wasn't gonna let him be right.

227
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,098
Anger as motivation.

228
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,752
Anger and inspiration.

229
00:11:49,261 --> 00:11:51,035
Every time I benched
another 10 pounds,

230
00:11:51,036 --> 00:11:53,418
I'd scratch two letters
into the plate.

231
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:54,781
What does it say?

232
00:11:56,491 --> 00:11:57,692
"P.S."?

233
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,887
It was the same summer
we started dating.

234
00:12:01,695 --> 00:12:03,376
We were pretty good together,
weren't we?

235
00:12:05,563 --> 00:12:06,578
Give me your hand.

236
00:12:07,622 --> 00:12:09,947
Come here.
I want you to feel this.

237
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:13,023
Jeez. What happened?

238
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,563
I broke that knuckle

239
00:12:14,564 --> 00:12:18,075
punching something after we'd
broken up for like the 20th time.

240
00:12:18,415 --> 00:12:20,042
We were horrible together.

241
00:12:20,424 --> 00:12:22,165
Yeah, I know. I...

242
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,333
I was just kind of hoping you'd forgot.

243
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:28,517
Okay, so I don't get it, we're supposed
to do this stuff on the list.

244
00:12:28,518 --> 00:12:30,292
And then take a picture
for the yearbook.

245
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:31,349
That's the plan.

246
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,964
Well, I already took
my photo for the yearbook,

247
00:12:32,965 --> 00:12:34,917
and my hair looked
really pretty that day.

248
00:12:35,228 --> 00:12:36,543
It's not that kind of photo.

249
00:12:36,544 --> 00:12:38,280
And anyway, it doesn't matter
because...

250
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:41,568
This assignment makes
me wanna get high.

251
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:43,495
Seriously.

252
00:12:43,878 --> 00:12:45,521
You're not listening. See, um...

253
00:12:45,671 --> 00:12:46,820
This assignment...

254
00:12:47,843 --> 00:12:50,141
makes me want to get high.

255
00:12:58,522 --> 00:13:00,851
I got a copy of the key,
and I stole the test.

256
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,736
That's great, Brooke.
Anything else?

257
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:10,218
I don't really believe in clean teens.
I just stayed in it because of you.

258
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:14,370
That's the one thing
I was really truthful about--

259
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:16,388
My feelings for you.

260
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:19,770
Well, it doesn't matter now, does it?

261
00:13:28,993 --> 00:13:30,335
Anyone for starting over?

262
00:13:31,237 --> 00:13:32,044
Hey.

263
00:13:33,885 --> 00:13:35,434
I'm sorry about judging you.

264
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,717
You seem like a really nice guy.

265
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:40,337
Okay, you got to stop saying that.

266
00:13:40,816 --> 00:13:41,623
Why?

267
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,670
Because that's part of the problem.

268
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,320
I hate being the nice guy, the...

269
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:48,696
little brother, the great friend.

270
00:13:49,982 --> 00:13:52,649
Just once I'd like to be
a little dangerous, you know?

271
00:13:53,506 --> 00:13:54,614
Not so safe.

272
00:13:56,548 --> 00:13:57,356
Yeah.

273
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:01,243
So, what's next on the list?

274
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:04,400
Okay, "Lighten up.

275
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,968
Do an impression of a celebrity
or a famous character".

276
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,696
This is gonna be awesome, baby!

277
00:14:15,703 --> 00:14:19,496
He's a diaper dandy,
a trifecta magician!

278
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,132
It's Dick Vitale.

279
00:14:23,724 --> 00:14:24,879
He's a sports announcer.

280
00:14:25,226 --> 00:14:26,437
He's really famous.

281
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:31,983
You seem somewhat familiar, love.

282
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,520
Have I threatened you before?

283
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:39,037
I'm captain Jack Sparrow.

284
00:14:40,898 --> 00:14:42,503
So my sister, Mary Kate, was like,

285
00:14:42,823 --> 00:14:44,851
"Ashley, you really need
to eat something."

286
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,913
Merry Christmas,
you old building and loan!

287
00:14:48,914 --> 00:14:51,214
I like you. Do you like me?

288
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:54,699
I like sexy-time explosion.

289
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:57,150
I'm sorry, Dawson. I just--

290
00:14:57,621 --> 00:14:59,049
I love Pacey.

291
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:03,856
Happy Birthday, Mr. President.

292
00:15:04,216 --> 00:15:06,413
Say hello to my little friend!

293
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,696
My wife, she very nice.

294
00:15:10,856 --> 00:15:11,880
High five!

295
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:16,069
My precious. My precious.
Got to keep it from the hobbitses.

296
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,686
Not the hobbitses...

297
00:15:20,513 --> 00:15:21,884
You do a really good Elmo.

298
00:15:29,097 --> 00:15:30,628
"Admit something that worries you

299
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,524
or something you're afraid of".

300
00:15:33,886 --> 00:15:34,695
You.

301
00:15:35,127 --> 00:15:35,935
Me?

302
00:15:36,498 --> 00:15:37,306
Why?

303
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:41,155
Because you're really pretty.

304
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:43,298
And, uh,

305
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,871
it's kind of intimidating.

306
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:54,082
I've walked into
a hundred enemy gyms,

307
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,561
thousands of fans
screaming at me, taunting me.

308
00:15:56,777 --> 00:15:57,960
I never flinched.

309
00:15:58,176 --> 00:15:59,734
I just take it all and light 'em up.

310
00:16:00,091 --> 00:16:00,899
No fear.

311
00:16:01,642 --> 00:16:02,647
But, uh...

312
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:05,389
the thought
of being a father...

313
00:16:08,189 --> 00:16:09,504
...scares the hell out of me.

314
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:13,692
I love the idea of being a mom.

315
00:16:13,758 --> 00:16:15,213
I really do, but...

316
00:16:16,388 --> 00:16:19,308
I just still want to leave
my mark on this world.

317
00:16:20,482 --> 00:16:21,693
That what scares you--

318
00:16:22,332 --> 00:16:23,778
Not having the chance to do that?

319
00:16:25,055 --> 00:16:26,463
Yeah, a little.

320
00:16:27,744 --> 00:16:28,561
And...

321
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,399
clowns.

322
00:16:33,446 --> 00:16:35,023
Clowns really scare me.

323
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,600
What are you afraid of, Rachel?

324
00:16:37,934 --> 00:16:38,734
Rachel?

325
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:43,778
I'm afraid...

326
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,355
...I am way too high to care.

327
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,251
I was worried
I wouldn't be enough for you.

328
00:17:02,173 --> 00:17:03,431
That's why I lied.

329
00:17:06,624 --> 00:17:07,929
That's what I'm afraid of.

330
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,569
Not being enough--

331
00:17:11,152 --> 00:17:11,959
Not...

332
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:14,243
hood enough,
not smart enough,

333
00:17:14,244 --> 00:17:15,829
not pretty enough, not...

334
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,989
Brooke, you're the student
council president,

335
00:17:18,185 --> 00:17:19,320
captain of the cheerleaders,

336
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:21,324
and probably one of the most
popular girls in school.

337
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:23,234
How is that not good enough?

338
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,062
I don't know.
You should ask my parents.

339
00:17:26,634 --> 00:17:28,728
Considering they haven't called
in a month.

340
00:17:30,597 --> 00:17:33,099
Month and a half, actually.

341
00:17:34,327 --> 00:17:36,348
Not a single call or text or e-mail,

342
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:38,423
so what do you suppose
that says about me?

343
00:17:40,951 --> 00:17:42,650
I think it says more
about your parents.

344
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:54,061
You haven't told me
what you're afraid of.

345
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:55,649
I'm afraid of my mom.

346
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,227
Come on. Is she really that bad?

347
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,166
See these diamond earrings?

348
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:04,882
I can only wear them at school
because I stole them from her.

349
00:18:06,204 --> 00:18:07,011
Why?

350
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,199
'Cause she loves them more than me.

351
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:11,717
How about you?

352
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:15,154
I'm killing two birds with one stone--

353
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:18,921
Something personal

354
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:20,207
and something I'm afraid of.

355
00:18:24,341 --> 00:18:26,529
This is the first draft
of a novel I'm writing.

356
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:29,543
That's the personal part.

357
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,047
Who knew?

358
00:18:32,596 --> 00:18:33,404
No one.

359
00:18:34,211 --> 00:18:35,037
How come?

360
00:18:35,835 --> 00:18:37,339
My first dream was to,

361
00:18:37,968 --> 00:18:39,320
olay professional basketball,

362
00:18:40,363 --> 00:18:41,593
and I already gave that up.

363
00:18:41,884 --> 00:18:43,133
You're holding my second dream.

364
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,996
If this thing sucks, it's gonna be
kind of hard to find a third one.

365
00:19:00,261 --> 00:19:02,796
Okay, what do you plan to be
in 10 years?

366
00:19:04,705 --> 00:19:06,019
In 10 years...

367
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:08,335
I plan to be 28.

368
00:19:13,683 --> 00:19:14,723
Not at this rate.

369
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:21,686
I want my fashion line
to be hugely successful.

370
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,713
I'd like to be a pilot.

371
00:19:24,742 --> 00:19:26,135
I've always wanted to fly...

372
00:19:27,517 --> 00:19:30,265
Just jet off
to faraway places.

373
00:19:33,228 --> 00:19:34,257
Milan.

374
00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:35,613
Why not?

375
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:37,716
That or be an "x" games champion.

376
00:19:40,082 --> 00:19:42,056
Totally make clean teens look badass.

377
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:49,166
Well, I hope in 10 years Haley's
got a bunch of platinum albums,

378
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,128
my dad learns how to be
a good grandparent,

379
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:53,428
my mom's alive and sober,

380
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,177
and, uh...

381
00:19:55,797 --> 00:19:58,147
Hopefully my son will have
a killer crossover dribble.

382
00:19:59,057 --> 00:20:04,410
Okay, but the question
is about you, Doofus.

383
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,258
Where do you plan to be in 10 years?

384
00:20:08,354 --> 00:20:09,875
I know, but, uh...

385
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:12,166
If everybody else's dreams
come true, then...

386
00:20:12,307 --> 00:20:13,133
I'll be fine.

387
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,055
Nate, I think it's great

388
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:19,501
that you take care of Haley and that
you're worried about your family.

389
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,811
But if you don't start putting
yourself first every once in a while

390
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:25,655
and chasing your own dream, then...

391
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:28,511
I'm scared you're gonna
wake up one day

392
00:20:28,512 --> 00:20:30,277
and have to wonder
what could have been.

393
00:20:31,473 --> 00:20:32,281
Like Dan.

394
00:20:34,684 --> 00:20:36,564
Don't be haunted like that, Nate.

395
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:44,222
You know basketball
is global now, right?

396
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,085
I mean,

397
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,653
everybody thinks
being a pro is just NBA.

398
00:20:51,495 --> 00:20:54,312
Me, I'd be happy just playing
basketball overseas somewhere.

399
00:20:55,457 --> 00:20:57,767
So when y'all roll through
on the world tour,

400
00:20:58,454 --> 00:21:00,839
we can remember this day
and sit back and laugh about it.

401
00:21:01,346 --> 00:21:04,567
Oh, man, I'd love to play music
for a living, but...

402
00:21:05,636 --> 00:21:07,648
If that doesn't happen,
I'll still be happy.

403
00:21:10,282 --> 00:21:11,137
Doing what?

404
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:13,399
You know, I don't know yet, but...

405
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:16,868
Whatever it is, it'll be okay, 'cause
I'll have a great group of friends.

406
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:20,995
that I can laugh with and a few secret
comforts that keep me sane--

407
00:21:21,227 --> 00:21:23,207
Like, I want a great big
tabby cat that greets me

408
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,496
when I come home every day.

409
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,400
And a boy that I'm love with.

410
00:21:31,292 --> 00:21:32,151
Yeah.

411
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:34,575
In 10 years, I'm...

412
00:21:34,881 --> 00:21:36,313
definitely in love.

413
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,767
Well, if I don't make it as a writer,
I can always--

414
00:21:42,858 --> 00:21:44,576
Come back here
and coach the Ravens.

415
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:46,360
I mean, Whitey's retiring,

416
00:21:46,608 --> 00:21:48,810
My mom's here,
and besides, I love this place.

417
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,193
Not me.

418
00:21:50,437 --> 00:21:51,996
I can't wait to get out of here.

419
00:21:52,324 --> 00:21:53,986
I'm going as far away as I can get,

420
00:21:54,109 --> 00:21:57,155
and I'm gonna try and forget
that this place ever existed.

421
00:21:58,565 --> 00:22:00,819
I never thought about
teaching until now, but...

422
00:22:01,636 --> 00:22:03,504
I think I could be
really happy doing that.

423
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:06,725
When I tutor someone...

424
00:22:08,145 --> 00:22:11,037
And I watch them get it--
Like, that light goes on--

425
00:22:11,985 --> 00:22:13,562
It just feels really good.

426
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:15,377
Anyway...

427
00:22:18,152 --> 00:22:22,055
So, look, we got one more thing to do
before we take our pictures.

428
00:22:25,374 --> 00:22:26,914
"Tell your partner a secret".

429
00:22:30,226 --> 00:22:31,775
This one gonna do some damage.

430
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:35,099
Rachel bet me that I couldn't sleep
with you within three dates.

431
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:42,041
Well...

432
00:22:43,327 --> 00:22:45,055
But I need you to know something.

433
00:22:47,224 --> 00:22:48,327
I would have never,

434
00:22:48,562 --> 00:22:50,680
ever asked you to compromise
what you believe in,

435
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:52,205
or tried to pressure you out of it.

436
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,399
That's the truth.

437
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,384
And I just need you to know it,

438
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,118
even though I know I don't have
a chance with you now.

439
00:23:05,673 --> 00:23:06,508
Is that it?

440
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,592
No more secrets?

441
00:23:09,994 --> 00:23:10,971
That's it.

442
00:23:11,918 --> 00:23:12,911
I promise.

443
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:17,814
Well, here's one more.

444
00:23:19,382 --> 00:23:20,612
You are enough, Brooke.

445
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:22,912
If I can just get you to quit lying,

446
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:25,462
I think I might like the real you.

447
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:28,600
But shh.

448
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,256
Don't tell anyone.

449
00:23:32,897 --> 00:23:33,807
It's a secret.

450
00:23:38,653 --> 00:23:41,305
What time is it? Feels like
we've been in here forever.

451
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:43,077
That's because you're wasted.

452
00:23:43,818 --> 00:23:44,795
I don't suppose you

453
00:23:44,796 --> 00:23:47,020
want to tell me a secret
and actually participate.

454
00:23:51,123 --> 00:23:52,100
I'll tell you a secret.

455
00:23:53,949 --> 00:23:55,303
Not because of class--

456
00:23:56,044 --> 00:23:57,451
Just because.

457
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:03,935
I never really felt anything
with the guys I slept with.

458
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,610
When I got my new body, I thought
it would change everything.

459
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:12,591
Maybe it did for the boys.

460
00:24:13,027 --> 00:24:13,976
Not for me.

461
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,389
You know,

462
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,989
I always wondered what
it would be like to be a dude,

463
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,085
like walking through
the halls in jeans

464
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,962
and a ratty t-shirt, all badass--

465
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,592
You know, talking smack and
checking out chicks and stuff.

466
00:24:29,017 --> 00:24:30,425
Checking out chicks.

467
00:24:31,252 --> 00:24:32,613
Maybe that's my problem.

468
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:34,917
Maybe I'm into girls.

469
00:24:41,265 --> 00:24:42,400
What the hell are you doing?

470
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:43,501
Did you feel anything?

471
00:24:43,838 --> 00:24:46,108
- No.
- Then you're not into girls.

472
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,457
Trust me, Rachel,
I'm a really good kisser,

473
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:50,224
and you'd totally be
into me right now.

474
00:24:52,968 --> 00:24:54,358
This is my scholarship offer--

475
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:56,312
Or not. I mean,

476
00:24:57,003 --> 00:24:58,702
I haven't had the courage
to open it yet.

477
00:24:58,871 --> 00:24:59,679
Skills,

478
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,181
you can't keep this a secret.

479
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,820
I've got a really good feeling
about it-- Open it.

480
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,504
Okay. Just give me
a few minutes, though.

481
00:25:12,487 --> 00:25:14,149
Why don't you tell me your secret?

482
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:18,237
Now we talking.

483
00:25:21,315 --> 00:25:22,742
Sometimes I feel...

484
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:26,667
Incredibly disconnected,

485
00:25:27,597 --> 00:25:29,721
really uncomfortable in my own skin,

486
00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:31,054
or kind of,

487
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:34,448
like I... don't fit into this world.

488
00:25:37,177 --> 00:25:39,050
Like I was born at the wrong time...

489
00:25:39,863 --> 00:25:41,234
And I don't belong.

490
00:25:42,494 --> 00:25:45,874
I just think about my son,
and it scares me, because,

491
00:25:46,926 --> 00:25:50,971
I don't ever want him
to feel like he doesn't belong.

492
00:25:52,141 --> 00:25:54,418
I don't know if my heart
could bear that.

493
00:25:58,133 --> 00:25:59,057
Nah.

494
00:26:00,105 --> 00:26:01,181
He'll belong.

495
00:26:02,114 --> 00:26:04,109
The kid gonna rock this place.

496
00:26:04,368 --> 00:26:05,241
You think so?

497
00:26:05,495 --> 00:26:06,387
Oh, yeah, I do,

498
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,933
'cause his mom got his back.

499
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:11,592
And if she don't, I do.

500
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,739
I promise.

501
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:17,917
Okay.

502
00:26:19,354 --> 00:26:20,161
Here.

503
00:26:23,262 --> 00:26:24,328
You're on the pill.

504
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:25,422
No.

505
00:26:25,891 --> 00:26:27,459
No, I'm not on the pill.

506
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,481
You have the pill,
but you're not on it.

507
00:26:30,564 --> 00:26:31,792
That's very secretive.

508
00:26:33,977 --> 00:26:35,394
When my mom
was in high school,

509
00:26:35,395 --> 00:26:37,319
she was one of the pretty
and popular.

510
00:26:38,387 --> 00:26:41,246
And I think her greatest
disappointment is that I'm not.

511
00:26:42,655 --> 00:26:44,176
Sometimes she teases me about it,

512
00:26:44,177 --> 00:26:45,828
and not in a fun way, like--

513
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,342
Like, why can't I lose
some weight...

514
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:52,018
And I'll never get a boyfriend.

515
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,602
That sucks.

516
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:58,499
Yeah.

517
00:27:00,048 --> 00:27:00,969
Anyway,

518
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,607
one day I got some
flowers from my boyfriend.

519
00:27:04,285 --> 00:27:05,599
So you have a boyfriend.

520
00:27:05,863 --> 00:27:06,680
Nope.

521
00:27:07,065 --> 00:27:09,581
I made him up, and
I sent the flowers to myself.

522
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,846
He was pretty awesome, though.
He sent me all kinds of things.

523
00:27:12,847 --> 00:27:15,003
Your imaginary boyfriend?

524
00:27:16,456 --> 00:27:17,294
Anyway,

525
00:27:17,782 --> 00:27:19,359
I told my mom
we were getting serious.

526
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,970
And that maybe
I should go on the pill.

527
00:27:21,783 --> 00:27:25,027
In my head, I thought it would
be this bonding experience, like...

528
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,389
She'd secretly be happy
for me and...

529
00:27:27,548 --> 00:27:29,727
And sit me down and counse me
about being safe,

530
00:27:29,728 --> 00:27:31,328
or just tell me to wait or...

531
00:27:32,323 --> 00:27:33,706
Just be my mom.

532
00:27:35,043 --> 00:27:36,975
Instead she took me
to the doctor.

533
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,167
And got me the pill.

534
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,311
And when we left the pharmacy,

535
00:27:40,312 --> 00:27:42,695
she handed me the prescription
and she said :

536
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:45,579
"I don't know who would sleep
with you, but here you go."

537
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:49,509
I'm sorry,

538
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:50,889
Glenda.

539
00:27:52,534 --> 00:27:53,341
It's okay.

540
00:27:54,897 --> 00:27:57,125
So I looked at her and I said,
"Well, I don't know who would sleep

541
00:27:57,126 --> 00:27:58,902
with you either, but here I am."

542
00:28:00,877 --> 00:28:02,419
And now we haven't spoken since--

543
00:28:03,268 --> 00:28:04,413
Not a word.

544
00:28:05,536 --> 00:28:06,625
How long has it been?

545
00:28:08,475 --> 00:28:09,716
Like eight weeks.

546
00:28:12,056 --> 00:28:14,283
She just drops me off
at school and picks me up,

547
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:17,058
and we just... don't talk.

548
00:28:18,649 --> 00:28:19,883
There's just silence--

549
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:23,991
Silence and disappointment.

550
00:28:31,537 --> 00:28:33,033
My mom tried to kill herself.

551
00:28:34,544 --> 00:28:35,371
What?

552
00:28:36,226 --> 00:28:37,794
She just took a bunch of her pills.

553
00:28:38,734 --> 00:28:39,918
I haven't told anybody--

554
00:28:40,293 --> 00:28:41,166
Just Haley.

555
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:44,323
Nathan, I'm so sorry.

556
00:28:44,565 --> 00:28:46,045
The worst part about it is...

557
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:48,593
when I found out she might die,

558
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:50,533
there was a moment--

559
00:28:50,633 --> 00:28:52,755
Just a fraction of a second--
Where I actually...

560
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:55,743
I felt relieved,

561
00:28:56,579 --> 00:28:58,104
Like maybe it was for the best.

562
00:28:58,841 --> 00:28:59,752
Do you believe that?

563
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:01,405
A kid actually feeling relief

564
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,935
at the thought of losing
his mother?

565
00:29:04,294 --> 00:29:05,299
Well, um...

566
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,217
What kind of person
does that make me,

567
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,487
Peyton,

568
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:10,081
That I could feel that?

569
00:29:15,932 --> 00:29:16,998
I can't whistle.

570
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:20,698
Nothing.

571
00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:29,303
That's terrible.

572
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:31,406
How can you not whistle?

573
00:29:31,407 --> 00:29:32,937
I know. Okay, I'm pathetic.

574
00:29:36,739 --> 00:29:38,531
I've got a pair of leather
pants in my locker

575
00:29:38,532 --> 00:29:40,157
that I've been dying to wear.

576
00:29:40,504 --> 00:29:42,739
Nice. You should totally rock those.

577
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,004
I can't. I'm a clean teen.

578
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:48,798
Doesn't exactly fit the image.

579
00:29:49,474 --> 00:29:50,920
Then change the image.

580
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,685
Mouth, before I...

581
00:30:00,186 --> 00:30:01,764
took back my virginity,

582
00:30:03,691 --> 00:30:04,799
I was kind of...

583
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:08,555
...friendly.

584
00:30:10,463 --> 00:30:12,463
It just figures.
Everyone saw me as a slut,

585
00:30:12,464 --> 00:30:14,201
and now I'm this radical virgin

586
00:30:14,202 --> 00:30:16,154
who can't wear
a pair of leather pants.

587
00:30:18,935 --> 00:30:21,151
Sometimes I just wish
they'd see me as a girl,

588
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:22,766
You know?

589
00:30:24,296 --> 00:30:25,169
Just a girl--

590
00:30:26,597 --> 00:30:27,419
Nice.

591
00:30:28,378 --> 00:30:29,702
Cool sometimes.

592
00:30:32,317 --> 00:30:33,256
Dorky.

593
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:36,169
Beautiful.

594
00:30:41,728 --> 00:30:42,613
So, uh...

595
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,312
How do you know about
all this media stuff?

596
00:30:45,664 --> 00:30:47,495
Oh, uh, me and Jimmy...

597
00:30:51,103 --> 00:30:52,192
Jimmy Edwards.

598
00:30:56,337 --> 00:30:57,323
He was my friend.

599
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:00,757
I, uh...

600
00:31:01,753 --> 00:31:02,795
miss him a lot.

601
00:31:05,255 --> 00:31:07,069
I have to keep it
a secret because...

602
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:09,877
He killed Lucas' uncle Keith,

603
00:31:10,853 --> 00:31:11,999
and I loved Keith.

604
00:31:15,815 --> 00:31:18,327
But that doesn't mean I don't
miss my friend, you know?

605
00:31:19,364 --> 00:31:21,064
Especially with graduation
coming up.

606
00:31:31,112 --> 00:31:32,013
So I...

607
00:31:33,426 --> 00:31:35,118
I never told you
what I'm afraid of--

608
00:31:36,226 --> 00:31:37,757
Second question on the list.

609
00:31:39,663 --> 00:31:41,458
I'm kind of afraid
of being here with you.

610
00:31:43,073 --> 00:31:43,975
Why?

611
00:31:46,681 --> 00:31:47,864
'Cause I'm a clean teen.

612
00:31:51,469 --> 00:31:52,390
And you're hot.

613
00:31:56,797 --> 00:31:58,759
I'm sorry I lied, Chase.

614
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:01,830
It's just you're a clean teen,

615
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,304
and you're hot and--

616
00:32:10,152 --> 00:32:12,568
Were you serious about me
being decent-Looking or...

617
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:14,995
were you just trying to
make up for the "geek" comment?

618
00:32:15,945 --> 00:32:17,516
I didn't say decent-looking.

619
00:32:18,882 --> 00:32:20,121
I said hot.

620
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:24,141
Mouth.

621
00:32:26,075 --> 00:32:27,110
I'm a clean teen.

622
00:32:27,457 --> 00:32:28,274
So what?

623
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:41,836
So I've been thinking
about your manuscript.

624
00:32:43,237 --> 00:32:45,526
You need to give it to someone
who won't go easy on you,

625
00:32:46,472 --> 00:32:48,078
someone who's gonna
tell you the truth.

626
00:32:48,637 --> 00:32:50,510
Someone like you?

627
00:32:51,796 --> 00:32:53,751
I haven't actually been
that truthful--

628
00:32:54,117 --> 00:32:55,394
I mean not about school.

629
00:32:57,432 --> 00:32:59,347
Truth is, I'm gonna miss this place,

630
00:32:59,873 --> 00:33:01,178
and it's all my fault.

631
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:05,506
I just wish I would have tried harder.

632
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,746
I mean, I just didn't want
to look like an idiot.

633
00:33:09,977 --> 00:33:12,250
I think everybody feels
that way sometimes.

634
00:33:14,363 --> 00:33:16,046
You know, like people don't,

635
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:18,177
see them for who
they really are.

636
00:33:18,881 --> 00:33:19,961
It's not just you.

637
00:33:22,892 --> 00:33:24,826
You would've made a great goth.
You know that?

638
00:33:25,794 --> 00:33:26,883
A little tortured,

639
00:33:27,813 --> 00:33:28,827
bit of a loner...

640
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:30,987
But kind.

641
00:33:34,336 --> 00:33:35,153
Hey,

642
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,200
I have an idea for your picture.

643
00:33:38,562 --> 00:33:41,219
Thank god this ridiculous
class is almost over.

644
00:33:41,444 --> 00:33:42,374
I liked it.

645
00:33:44,806 --> 00:33:47,529
That's because you're too
blissfully stupid to resist.

646
00:33:50,623 --> 00:33:52,078
I know people think I'm stupid.

647
00:33:53,789 --> 00:33:54,784
But I'm not dumb.

648
00:33:56,963 --> 00:33:58,240
I just let you and the other girls

649
00:33:58,241 --> 00:34:00,353
have your way because
that's how you need it to be.

650
00:34:01,742 --> 00:34:02,993
But I think Carl's right.

651
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:06,189
Pretty soon we're all gonna
graduate, and...

652
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,335
I can start over.

653
00:34:09,529 --> 00:34:11,444
But it'll be harder for
the people who need this place

654
00:34:11,445 --> 00:34:12,863
to make themselves feel special.

655
00:34:15,881 --> 00:34:17,909
People who use high school
to build themselves up

656
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,024
and then find out that...

657
00:34:20,723 --> 00:34:23,615
The real world doesn't care so much
about who you were in high school.

658
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:27,268
People like you.

659
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,718
Okay, so,

660
00:34:34,934 --> 00:34:36,577
what are we gonna do
for our pictures?

661
00:34:43,223 --> 00:34:44,876
You need to go get
those leather pants.

662
00:34:45,087 --> 00:34:46,824
- What?
- For the picture.

663
00:34:49,474 --> 00:34:51,775
Also, you need
to take off your shirt.

664
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,190
Wait. What?

665
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,683
Take off your shirt.

666
00:34:56,049 --> 00:34:57,852
Wow, just like the old days.

667
00:34:57,983 --> 00:34:59,974
Stop it. I have an idea
for your picture.

668
00:35:00,979 --> 00:35:02,990
But before you do that, come here.

669
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:07,835
Look, the bell's gonna ring soon,

670
00:35:07,836 --> 00:35:09,964
and I don't know if I'm gonna
get a chance to say it so I'm just,

671
00:35:09,965 --> 00:35:11,355
gonna say it now.

672
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:14,407
You're doing great, Nathan,

673
00:35:14,994 --> 00:35:16,459
all right? Just please...

674
00:35:16,956 --> 00:35:18,609
Put yourself first sometimes.

675
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,281
Well, now let's see
the merchandise.

676
00:35:22,282 --> 00:35:23,540
Oh, funny.

677
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:25,324
Let's go. Chop-chop, baby.

678
00:35:27,606 --> 00:35:28,747
I want you to open it.

679
00:35:30,868 --> 00:35:31,854
Tell me,

680
00:35:32,553 --> 00:35:34,924
if it's the factory or college.

681
00:35:36,737 --> 00:35:37,544
All right.

682
00:35:37,748 --> 00:35:39,791
But I want you to know,
no matter what this letter says,

683
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:41,837
you're gonna find your way
to some great things,

684
00:35:42,494 --> 00:35:43,480
I know it.

685
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,350
Yeah, well
if it all means the same,

686
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:48,825
I'd rather find my great things
through college.

687
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:01,898
Well,

688
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:05,684
it looks like you'll be
going into that factory.

689
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:12,719
And you're gonna tell your father that
you just got a full ride to college.

690
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:18,902
Girl, that's messed up.

691
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,387
I almost threw my ass off
this damn roof.

692
00:36:25,552 --> 00:36:26,576
So how about it?

693
00:36:27,155 --> 00:36:29,051
You think one class
can change your life?

694
00:36:30,094 --> 00:36:31,108
The way you kiss?

695
00:36:32,178 --> 00:36:33,098
Definitely.

696
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:35,974
Still think you're not good enough?

697
00:36:38,265 --> 00:36:39,777
I don't think that ever goes away.

698
00:36:41,293 --> 00:36:43,847
But I think you just have
to learn to deal with it, you know?

699
00:36:45,227 --> 00:36:46,382
Learn to use it.

700
00:36:49,021 --> 00:36:50,270
So let's use it, then.

701
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:05,510
<i>Today I spent an hour with Brooke Davis,
and I learned something.</i>

702
00:37:07,538 --> 00:37:08,965
<i>People are gonna label you.</i>

703
00:37:10,243 --> 00:37:12,121
<i>It's how you overcome those labels.</i>

704
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,680
<i>That's what matters.</i>

705
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,915
<i>I spent an hour
with Chase Adams.</i>

706
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,840
<i>He's a clean teen.</i>

707
00:37:29,955 --> 00:37:31,157
<i>And that's pretty cool.</i>

708
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:40,418
<i>People think they know Nathan Scott.</i>

709
00:37:41,864 --> 00:37:42,962
<i>I know I did.</i>

710
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,939
<i>But I discovered
something new today.</i>

711
00:37:47,997 --> 00:37:49,819
<i>Nathan Scott is a martyr.</i>

712
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,711
<i>He's also gonna be a terrific father.</i>

713
00:37:58,641 --> 00:38:00,472
<i>I spent the class
with Peyton Sawyer.</i>

714
00:38:02,106 --> 00:38:03,946
<i>It reminded me
of what a good friend she is.</i>

715
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,713
<i>I also learned that,
considering recent history,</i>

716
00:38:08,127 --> 00:38:10,244
<i>she's not quite ready
for the whole picture thing.</i>

717
00:38:15,298 --> 00:38:17,965
<i>Some of you have met
Shelly simon, clean teen.</i>

718
00:38:18,603 --> 00:38:20,913
<i>But today I got to know
Shelly Simon,</i>

719
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:22,369
<i>teen.</i>

720
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,197
<i>I also asked her to prom.</i>

721
00:38:29,798 --> 00:38:32,438
<i>An hour ago I called
Marvin McFadden nice.</i>

722
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:36,082
<i>He is.</i>

723
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:39,680
<i>But I should have
called him dangerous.</i>

724
00:38:43,745 --> 00:38:45,313
<i>I also said yes to prom.</i>

725
00:38:48,501 --> 00:38:51,011
<i>This is one of the best classes
I've ever had.</i>

726
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,539
<i>A kick-ass 50 minutes</i>

727
00:38:56,878 --> 00:38:58,624
<i>during which Bevin told me,</i>

728
00:38:59,244 --> 00:39:00,728
<i>she always wanted to be a guy.</i>

729
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:12,365
<i>I spent the hour with Rachel,</i>

730
00:39:12,464 --> 00:39:15,854
<i>and I think she learned today
that I am not an idiot.</i>

731
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:19,452
<i>This is my picture of her.</i>

732
00:39:23,022 --> 00:39:25,726
<i>Over the years, I've known
Haley James, bookworm,</i>

733
00:39:25,914 --> 00:39:27,604
<i>Haley James, sarcastic girl,</i>

734
00:39:28,242 --> 00:39:30,247
<i>Haley James Scott, rock star,</i>

735
00:39:30,383 --> 00:39:32,646
<i>and Haley James Scott, mother-to-be.</i>

736
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:35,269
<i>Today I got reacquainted
with just Haley,</i>

737
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,254
<i>my good friend.</i>

738
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,569
<i>She's getting heavier, too.</i>

739
00:39:41,158 --> 00:39:43,702
<i>Skills has been my friend
since we were young.</i>

740
00:39:45,026 --> 00:39:47,064
<i>And today I remembered why--</i>

741
00:39:47,656 --> 00:39:48,829
<i>He's a great listener.</i>

742
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,333
<i>He's gonna do awesome in college.</i>

743
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:55,882
<i>And he deserves to be
on top of the world.</i>

744
00:39:56,682 --> 00:39:59,659
<i>50 minutes ago,
I called Lucas Scott a jock,</i>

745
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,377
<i>but I was wrong.</i>

746
00:40:01,678 --> 00:40:03,274
<i>He's more than one simple word.</i>

747
00:40:03,499 --> 00:40:04,851
<i>I guess we all are.</i>

748
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,853
<i>Anyway, I learned that Lucas
is actually a lot like me.</i>

749
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:10,853
<i>Who knew?</i>

750
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,493
<i>I wish I would have hung out
with Glenda before today.</i>

751
00:40:19,324 --> 00:40:21,709
<i>Something tells me
she could have been a great friend.</i>

752
00:40:24,087 --> 00:40:26,857
<i>But it's good to know there's still
a little time left to do that.</i>

753
00:40:27,195 --> 00:40:28,002
Glenda!

754
00:40:37,025 --> 00:40:39,062
Listen, would you mind taking
a look at this for me?

755
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,418
I need someone I can trust
to tell me the truth.

756
00:40:43,706 --> 00:40:45,312
Sure. Okay...

757
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,969
Lucas Scott.

758
00:40:48,523 --> 00:40:49,323
Hey,

759
00:40:49,802 --> 00:40:51,952
today was awesome.
I had a blast with you.

760
00:40:55,323 --> 00:40:56,301
See you tomorrow.

761
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,808
<i>And I also learned her last name.</i>

762
00:40:59,325 --> 00:41:00,414
Hey, Mrs. Farrell.

763
00:41:03,786 --> 00:41:05,186
Okay, mom. Let's go.

764
00:41:15,027 --> 00:41:16,707
<i>And I've learned that one hour...</i>

765
00:41:18,294 --> 00:41:19,928
<i>can change everything.</i>
