1
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,990
-Hey.
-Hey.

2
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,810
How's the writing going?

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,280
Slow,sluggish,and plodding.

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,930
Mostly just messing around
with my online thesaurus.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,540
Hmm,apparently.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,620
I was doing some organizing,
and look what I found.

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,200
That was a long time ago.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,370
You know what I love about it?

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,180
That smile on your face.

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,170
I don't think I've ever
seen you look so happy.

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,360
Makes me wonder if maybe
you were happier then.

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,460
You know?Before the book was published.

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,510
Before you moved back home.

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,830
Before us.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,570
Lindsey... ...you make me so happy.

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,790
Really?

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,040
You wouldn't change anything?

18
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,300
Not a thing.

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,370
tomorrow night,you play
for the division ii title.

20
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:27,400
However,in my opinion,you can go up
against any college squad in the nation.

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,390
Now,for those of you who
have won a championship,

22
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,790
I don't have to remind you
how good it makes you feel.

23
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,470
The rest of you will
just have to trust me.

24
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:45,960
Now,I want you to go home and hit
the sheets -- preferably alone.

25
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,230
Coach.

26
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,270
Go home,luke.

27
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,540
Actually,I was thinking I was
gonna watch a little bit more tape.

28
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,180
Lucas,you've been a great
assistant coach this year,

29
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,330
and someday you're gonna take over the
team,but for now,you take orders from me.

30
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,820
Go home and go to bed.

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,580
All right.

32
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,800
Oh,and no late-night cyber
chats with long-distance blondie.

33
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,090
All right.

34
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,600
There's my little track star.

35
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,990
-Hi!
-Hey,buddy.

36
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,210
-Oh,sweetie,
he is - - ball.

37
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,640
Did you hear that?

38
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,110
He just said "ball.

39
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,780
-" I swear he just said "ball.
-" He said "ball," man.

40
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,540
He's definitely your son!

41
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,920
And he's a lucky kid.

42
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,930
You look more and
more like me every day.

43
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,810
Say it again.Say it again.

44
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,310
"Ball." "Ball.

45
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,150
-Hey.
-Hi.

46
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,780
What time is it?

47
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,420
Almost 4:30.

48
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,930
I couldn't sleep either.

49
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,900
Yeah,neither could he.

50
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,650
You just excited about seeing
peyton or the game or what?

51
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,730
Actually,peyton's not coming.

52
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,340
She couldn't get away from work.

53
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,010
Oh,I'm sorry,luke.

54
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,420
I guess that's life
in the music business.

55
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,560
I guess.

56
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,980
Do you ever miss it?

57
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,050
Mm,sometimes.

58
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,690
Especially when I see you chasing
your dreams of being a writer.

59
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,100
But,uh,I'll get back to
chasing my dreams someday.

60
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:42,580
All I have to show for my writing
career is a stack of rejection letters.

61
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,850
Besides,when I see the
three of you together,I...

62
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,810
I just want what you guys have.

63
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,510
You know we could not have done this last
year without you living here and helping.

64
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,770
Between school and
basketball and jamie...

65
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,630
I know it's hard to be away from peyton.

66
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,540
We all made sacrifices.

67
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,450
I mean,for the first time in your
academic career,you're getting b'S.

68
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,850
It was a b-plus,okay?

69
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,740
-Hey.
-Yeah?

70
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,120
You're a part of this family,
and you always will be.

71
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,660
Thanks.

72
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,850
Night,little man.

73
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,790
Ball.

74
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,750
Yes.I will get your ball.

75
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,760
Little early,aren't you?

76
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:42,990
Well,maybe after tonight people will look
at me as a champion again,not a point-shaver.

77
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,390
We're gonna win thne,blittlerother.

78
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,210
Oh,yeah.

79
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,730
This is the ultimate cinderella story.

80
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,470
For years the cobras have been
perennial doormats,but this season,

81
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,280
under the leadership of nathan
scott,their fortunes have changed.

82
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,790
Attack the gap!

83
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,600
Get back on "d"!Come on!

84
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,410
Look high-low!Look
high-low!

85
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,410
After a game that's
seen 17 lead changes,

86
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,480
we're all tied up with less than
a minute to go in the fourth.

87
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,980
Scott's been carrying this team,but
does he have enough left in his tank?

88
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,150
-All right.
-Now,listen up.

89
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,260
Sorry,coach.

90
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,630
What's the game plan?

91
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,370
You tell me.

92
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,580
You know,I told you someday
that you'd be taking over.

93
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,320
Well,this is it.

94
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,320
You're ready.

95
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,620
Go on.

96
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,730
Bring us home.

97
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,620
It appears whitey durham is
headed to the locker room.

98
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,520
I guess that leaves the cobras under the
leadership of assistant coach lucas scott,

99
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,670
who used to play for
durham once upon a time.

100
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,960
Okay.Heads up.

101
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,460
We're gonna go man-to-man,
full-court press.

102
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,060
I want you to force the ball sidelines.

103
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,910
Anticipate this pass over the top.

104
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,300
When we get the ball back,
they're gonna double-team,

105
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,890
so I want you to stagger
screens here and here.

106
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,340
Nathan,ball's in your hands.

107
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,220
Whatever you say... coach.

108
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,310
All right.

109
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,150
Let's win this.

110
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,300
On three.

111
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,370
One,two,three.

112
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,080
Cobras!

113
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,090
Hey,nate!

114
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,160
Maybe you want to consider the fadeaway.

115
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,810
Fadeaway's weak,man.

116
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,540
All right,match up by the 12!

117
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,300
Nice.

118
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,080
-it's you.
-What?

119
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,420
When all my dreams come true,the
one I want next to me -- I-it's you.

120
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,410
It's you,peyton.

124
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,500
Good job,son.

125
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,220
You ran that final play
just like I would have.

126
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,150
Maybe so,but you sure do know
how to kick a guy out of the nest.

127
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:52,340
Lucas,you were always a great player,
but you're an even better coach.

128
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,580
There's nothing more I can teach you,
which is why this is my final game.

129
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,200
Coach.

130
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,310
I've already talked to the
dean and the A.D.About it.

131
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,210
They've never had a student
coach before,but,uh,then again,

132
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,070
they've never had a
championship before,either.

133
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,070
They both agreed that you're ready.

134
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,160
I-I don't know what to say.

135
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,710
Just promise me you'll always remember there are
more important things in life than basketball.

136
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,530
So,what about you?I mean,
what are you gonna do now?

137
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,170
Oh,I don't know.Now that I'm retired,

138
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:34,040
probably go to basketball
games and yell at the coach.

139
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,170
I would agree with that as well,
but,I mean,after a season like that,

140
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,550
the d-I scouts have got to take notice.

141
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,160
Right now,I'm just happy
with playing the game.

142
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,760
If there's one thing this year's taught me
it's that the most important thing is my family.

143
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,270
Hey,nate.

144
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,680
-The bus is leaving.
-Okay.

145
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,680
Hey,thanks for your time.

146
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:56,880
So,how'd it go?

147
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,320
That was the first time in a year I
didn't get asked about point-shaving.

148
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,760
All right.

149
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,700
-Hi,sweetie.
- Hey,you ready?

150
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,650
Oh,you should ride with the
team.We just wanted to say goodbye.

151
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,690
-See you at home.
-See you,hales.

152
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,720
Hey,scott.You got a cute kid.

153
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,380
Wonder if he'll grow up to
be a cheater like his old man.

154
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,980
Just think -- you could teach
him to shave and shave points.

155
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,290
Why don't I shave your
face on the pavement?

156
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,880
Come on,nate.Come on.

157
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,820
Nate!Come on.

158
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,150
Get on the bus.Get on the bus!

159
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,030
play this song when you win
the championship.--peyton

160
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,810
That was a hell of a move tonight.

161
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,940
Soon as the ball left my
hands,I knew it was going in.

162
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,190
I'm talking about after the game.

163
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:18,790
Look,I didn't put off my pension so you
can beat up any jackass that heckles you.

164
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,970
I know.I'm sorry.

165
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,400
You've worked hard this season.

166
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,310
A lot of eyes are on you.

167
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,670
But you've got to be careful.

168
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:32,940
If you're not,that temper of
yours will be all you have left.

169
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,270
I just don't know if people are ever
gonna forget the mistakes I've made.

170
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,040
The important thing is
for you to get past them.

171
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,390
I mean,this is not gonna go
away just by playing better.

172
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,960
You've got to live better.

173
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,650
You're right.

174
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,260
I get it,coach.

175
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,660
Nathan,I just don't want you
to look back down the road

176
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:56,300
in a couple of years and
wonder what might have been.

177
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,710
We all know where that
path can lead a man.

178
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,670
Dan.

179
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,790
For the record,that last
shot was a hell of a move.

180
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,350
-Hey,coach.
-Hey.

181
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,230
So,37 years of coaching --
where does this night rank?

182
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,540
This would be number three.

183
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,770
Number two was your
high-school championship.

184
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,860
And what was the first?

185
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,560
The first was the night
camilla agreed to join

186
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,090
a scrawny kid just embarking
on a 37-year coaching career.

187
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,930
There's more important things
in life than basketball.

188
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,040
That's right.

189
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,690
Hey,coach.

190
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,540
You wouldn't mind dropping
me by the airport,would you?

191
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,860
Be happy to,son.

192
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,560
Hey,sawyer,you got a call on line 1.

193
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,950
Okay.

194
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,760
This is peyton.

195
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,660
Hey.It's me.

196
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,460
I've been trying to
call you all morning.

197
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,740
I watched the game highlights online.

198
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,600
I wish I could have been there.

199
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,570
Yeah,me too.

200
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,110
So,uh,what are you wearing?

201
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,330
Luke,I-I can't do that right now.

202
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,580
I'm at work.

203
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,940
Well,I'm thinking a pink floyd tee
over the long-sleeve white shirt

204
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,120
and maybe those sexy jeans
with the hole in the knee?

205
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,170
Wow.You are good!

206
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,150
yes,i'm.

207
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,010
Really good.

208
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,460
Luke!

209
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,960
Hi!

210
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,520
I can't believe you're here!

211
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,920
Yeah,well,since you
couldn't come see me...

212
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,870
-hi
-Hi.

213
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,840
So,uh,this is marketing
and distribution?

214
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,590
so,I might ve pimped up my
job description just a little.

215
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,720
Basically,I work in the mail room.

216
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,240
Well,that's hollywood,
right?It's always abouthe spin.

217
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,280
I'll bet you know more about
music than most of these tools.

218
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,430
Shh,you're gonna get me in trouble.

219
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,080
And they are not all tools,okay?

220
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,460
Not in the box
-- on my desk.

221
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,580
Right.I'm sorry.

222
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,960
And,you,onion bagel,
light on the cream cheese.

223
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,330
Right away,carl.

224
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,880
It's blake!

225
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,470
Well,it's good to see they're nice.

226
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,130
No.Seriously.Why do
you put up with this?

227
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,360
I will show you why.

228
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,140
See that girl right there?

229
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,170
Three months ago she was in thehe mail
room,and now she's a junior a&r exec.

230
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,760
Yeah,but I bet she didn't produce two
albums before she graduated high school.

231
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,320
Okay.You're gonna have to go
before you get us both fired.

232
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,610
All right.

233
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,380
Look,I got dinner
reservations for us at 8:00.

234
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,720
Is that too late?

235
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,540
No,it's actually --
it's kind of early.

236
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,140
We usually go till at least 9:00.

237
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,710
All right.Then it's 9:30.

238
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,470
Perfect.I'll meet you at the restaurant.

239
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,020
Just text me the address,okay?

240
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,480
All right.

241
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,090
God,luke,it is so good to see you.

242
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,830
Bye.

243
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,600
Hi!I am so sorry.I'm so late.

244
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,580
I got stuck going over the canyon.

245
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,220
It's okay.I'm just glad you're here.

246
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,870
God,look at you!

247
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,850
What?

248
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,420
No.I just -- I haven't seen
a suit on anybody in so long,

249
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:53,230
unless they're an agent or a
lawyer or a successful novelist.

250
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,520
Oh,I don't know about that.

251
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,540
I get a new rejection letter every day.

252
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,370
Luke,your book is good.

253
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,240
It's gonna happen.I know it.

254
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,220
So when the executives blow off
the shows,we get the tickets.

255
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,890
Like monday,I went and saw
ryan adams at the viper room,

256
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:19,220
and then wednesday was tegan and
sara at the roxy,and,I don't know,

257
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,250
I just -- it blows
my mind,you know?

258
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,400
These are bands we grew up listening
to,and now I've got a front-row seat.

259
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,390
That's great.

260
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,230
We've had our fair share of
bands in tree hill,thanks to you.

261
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,950
God.Anyway,enough about me.

262
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,690
You won a freaking championship!

263
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,410
I want to hear everything.

264
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,830
Well,whitey's gonna step down as head
coach,and he wants me to take over the team.

265
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,790
He thinks it'll be good for
nathan and... he thinks I'm ready.

266
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,430
Luke,that's incredible.

267
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,640
I know -- I get salary,
benefits,and a big office.

268
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,180
Wow.That sounds very...adult.

269
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,850
I got that song you sent.

270
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,280
Oh.You know what?I have
something else for you,too.

271
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:03,980
I made you a mix of a bunch of stuff
that doesn't street for a couple months.

272
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,860
Thank you.

273
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,550
I got you something,too.Um...

274
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:14,540
Oh,crap.I'm sorry.

275
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,270
-It's work.
-Don't answer.

276
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,100
They're just gonna keep calling back.

277
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,840
Hello.

278
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,760
Yeah --
right now?

279
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,110
Yeah,um,of course I like my job.

280
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,170
Okay.Right away,sir.

281
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,510
I'm sorry.

282
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,210
Can't you at least stay for dessert?

283
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:41,160
Tell you what -- how about we
have dessert back at my place?

284
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,320
Or how about at our room
at the beverly hilton?

285
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,910
Luke,you did not have to do that.

286
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,200
I wanted to.

287
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,770
All right.This is gonna be
quick.I'll be there by 11:00.

288
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,290
-I promise.
-All right.

289
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,930
Bye.

290
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,640
Hey.

291
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,050
When did you get here?

292
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,700
I don't know.Like an hour ago.

293
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,630
You know,you could have,
uh... could have woke me up.

294
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,300
Luke.

295
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,040
What is this?

296
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,110
I couldn't bring myself to open it,

297
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:13,580
but I -- I've just been sitting here
thinking about how much I love you.

298
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,360
Well,I wanted it to be a surprise,but,

299
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,910
Peyton,I love you,and I want
us to be together forever.

300
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,700
Luke,wait.Okay.

301
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,780
I-I know it's a bit sudden,okay?

302
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:47,770
But,I mean,yesterday was a great day.

303
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:55,990
And I'm sitting on the bus,and I realized
none of my great days of my life...

304
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,750
matter without you.

305
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,720
You're the one I want next to
me when my dreams come true,

306
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,850
and you're the one I want
next to me if they don'T.

307
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,490
As long as I have you...
nothing else matters.

308
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:16,220
There's -- it's just not
as simple as all that,okay?

309
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,970
There's a lot we have to talk about.

310
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,080
I know,but we'll figure out the
details when we get back to tree hill.

311
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,710
Okay,I know that's home for
you,and I miss it sometimes

312
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,370
-- I do -- but for me,
tree hill is two dead moms

313
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,800
and a psycho stalker and
some really painful memories.

314
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:37,330
I actually had to move out to hollywood
to get away from all the drama.

315
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:40,940
So right now,this is my home,and
the only thing that's missing is you.

316
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:41,740
Then I'll move here.

317
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,640
No.Luke,honey,

318
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,680
whitey believes in you,
and nathan needs you.

319
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,540
And if I ask you to walk
away from your dream,

320
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,670
you're gonna wake up one
day and resent me for it --

321
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,310
the same way I would feel
if you asked me to leave L.A.

322
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:01,060
Peyton... you get people
coffee and you deliver mail.

323
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,490
You were doing more
than that in tree hill.

324
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,590
Well,I love you for believing that,
but I have to prove that to myself.

325
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,320
I mean,you see,that's the thing.

326
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,780
We both have so much we want to do
with our lives,and we're only 19.

327
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,100
And nathan and haley were
a lot younger than that.

328
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,770
Okay.Well,we see how easy that's been.

329
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,980
Come on.In another year...

330
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,190
peyton...

331
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:29,950
we've seen each other three
times in the last year.

332
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,840
We go days without talking.

333
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,070
We trade few e-mails.

334
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,290
We've already grown so far apart.

335
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,030
Who knows where we'll
be a year from now?

336
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,170
Luke,if you can't trust that
our love can make it one year,

337
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,670
I don't understand how we can be
talking about forever right now.

338
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,340
You're saying no.

339
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,820
No!

340
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,740
I -- I am
not saying no.

341
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,000
I'm saying not now.

342
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,540
I want to marry you someday.

343
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,520
Hey,don't do that.Don't
pull away from me,okay?

344
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,890
I want us to be together!

345
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,530
I love you so much.

346
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,550
Just not enough.

347
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,590
Okay.Can we take this back?

348
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,110
Can we just pretend like
you never woke up?Please!

349
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,750
I don't think we can.

350
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,790
I'm afraid that this conversation
is gonna end with... "

351
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,570
goodbye.

352
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,920
" Luke,don'T.Come here.

353
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:38,880
Our dreams are gonna come true,
lucas -- my music and your novel.

354
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,130
It's gonna happen.

355
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,740
goodbye,peyton.

356
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,620
luke?

357
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,640
...flight to hartford.

358
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,070
-hi.
-hi

359
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,430
I'm sorry to bother you,but I have to
get back a little sooner than expected.

360
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,770
See what we can do.

361
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,410
Thanks.

362
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,500
excuse me....one second

363
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,680
-Hello.
-hi

364
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,160
Is this lucas scott?

365
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,410
Yeah.Who's this?

366
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,920
Uh,my name's lindsey strauss.

367
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,600
I'm a junior editor at putnam and pratt.

368
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,640
I,uh,read your novel.

369
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,590
Well,it's nice of you to call.

370
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,900
Everyone else sends their
rejection letters first-class.

371
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,730
Actually,I loved it.

372
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,900
And I passed it on to my boss,
and he feels the same way.

373
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,070
Hello?

374
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,650
No,I-I'm still here.

375
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,990
What I'm saying is,we want
to publish your book,lucas.

376
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,200
How soon can you be in new york?

377
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,580
Uh,I'll figure it out.

378
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:53,250
Yeah.Okay.I'm looking
forward to seeing you,too.

379
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,480
Bye.

380
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,350
I need to go to new york.

381
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,380
They're publishing my novel.

382
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,570
Congratulations.

383
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,560
Must be a dream come true.

384
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,090
You're all set.

385
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,050
Hey,I need you to go on a coffee run.

386
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,810
Okay.In a minute.

387
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,450
I don't have a minute.

388
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,960
Hey.

389
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,200
I said I need a minute!

390
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:47,700
Don't get me wrong -- the writing's
good,but I'm not gonna lie to you.

391
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,870
When I found out your father
was a convicted murderer --

392
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:53,220
I mean,that's exactly the kind
of hook we need in today's market.

393
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,950
I think our newest literary
talent needs a drink.

394
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,040
When you're done,let's talk
about changing that title.

395
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,110
What's wrong with the title?

396
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,560
They say that about every book.

397
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:02,960
I love the title.

398
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,920
"Murder of crows,parliament of owls.

399
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,640
" You seem a little
young to be an editor.

400
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,710
Well,you seem kind of young
to have a book being published.

401
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,320
Fair enough.

402
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,440
The truth is... your novel's my first.

403
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:17,850
I graduated last year.

404
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,150
My dad runs the company,but I need
to prove myself like everyone else --

405
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,830
maybe more.

406
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,760
I know how that is.

407
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,370
Luke,I don't care who your father is.

408
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,190
I read a lot of manuscripts,but yours was
the first one that actually spoke to me.

409
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:38,090
I mean,yeah,there's some rough
parts,but your writing has truth,soul.

410
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,240
Rough parts?

411
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,780
Look,I promise,as your editor, I'll
always be faithful to your voice,

412
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,490
but there's some work to do.

413
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,850
It'll take six months before
it's ready for publication --

414
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,140
maybe a little longer.

415
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,790
-That long?
-Yeah.

416
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:54,680
We're talking late hours,
long nights,heated arguments.

417
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,090
It'll probably feel like we're married.

418
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,930
Th j was aoke.

419
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,860
It's just been a long day,that's all.

420
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:05,000
Then you better get some rest,
'cause we start on monday.

421
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,560
Hey,lindsey,wait.

422
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:12,810
Um... I just wanted to say thank
you for... changing my life.

423
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,630
That was all you,lucas.

424
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,790
But can I ask you something?

425
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,570
Yeah.

426
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:24,360
-The luke and peyton in the novel...
- no.

427
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,360
I'm sorry.

428
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,250
I was rooting for them.

429
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,950
See you monday.

430
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,190
Excuse me,mr.Scott.There's
someone here to see you.

431
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,540
She said to tell you
she's from tree hill.

432
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,580
Well,well.Lucas scott.

433
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,800
You got my message.

434
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,960
You think I was gonna miss a
chance to spend a night on the town

435
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,660
with a
soon-to-be-best-selling author?

436
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,030
God,it is good to see you,brooke.

437
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,940
Yeah.

438
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:00,730
So then my mom moved up
here with me from L.A.

439
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,920
,'Cause my dad travels so much.

440
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:07,570
I think they should just man up and
call it what it is -- trial separation.

441
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,880
I can't believe your
book's gonna be published.

442
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,640
You're gonna be such a rock star.

443
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,730
Come on.You're the one
with the big clothing line.

444
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,980
True.

445
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,690
But my mom thinks we can
do better with that,too.

446
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,300
Check this out.

447
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:24,220
It's her plans to take clothes
over bro's to the next level.

448
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,500
We have high-end couture,a cosmetic
company,and my own magazine.

449
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,160
B.Davis?

450
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,060
Hey,wait.

451
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,430
You could give my book
its first good review.

452
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:42,320
You know,sometimes expanding
seems like a good idea,and...

453
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,280
sometimes I don't know.

454
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,990
It's the most time I've spent with
my mom since the maternity ward,

455
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:51,380
but I'm scared if I let her in,clothes over
bro's isn't gonna be mine anymore,you know?

456
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,840
Yeah.I know what you mean.

457
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:56,630
There's,uh,this editor
girl -- uh,lindsey.

458
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,030
She just wants to make all
these changes to my novel.

459
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,520
Pretty high-class problems we got.

460
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,480
We should be celebrating,
not complaining!

461
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,580
Where's peyton?She must
be so thrilled for you.

462
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,770
We broke up.

463
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,980
Shut up.

464
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,060
Oh,luke,I'm sorry.

465
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,600
What happened?

466
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:24,630
I-I went to L.A.,I asked her
to marry me,and she said no.

467
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,470
Are you stupid?

468
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:33,680
You -- you stormed L.A.,And
you went all naley on her?

469
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:38,360
Did -- did you even
buy A... ...ring.

470
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,480
She never even saw it.

471
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,960
How do you propose to someone
without them seeing the ring?

472
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,390
Well,I,uh,I got down on
one knee,and,um,I said,

473
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,210
"I want us to be together forever.

474
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,690
" Never mind.You
definitely did it right.

475
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,930
I mean,did you see the look on her face?

476
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,840
Looked like somebody
spewed on her jimmy choos.

477
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,120
I'm really glad you're enjoying this.

478
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,360
Oh,come on,luke.

479
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:18,810
You and peyton will work it out.

480
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,900
I don't think so,brooke.Not this time.

481
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,550
Well,it sounds to me like you
gave her an ultimatum,and,trust me,

482
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:28,740
there is no quicker
way to paralyze a girl.

483
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,920
Okay.Um...

484
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:35,860
how many times have you talked
to peyton since you left L.A.?

485
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,750
That's not fair.

486
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,730
We're both really busy.

487
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,510
And today she broke up b heroyfriend.

488
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,400
Has she called you yet?

489
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,670
Things have changed.

490
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,030
I think you're saying
that 'cause you're hurt.

491
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,020
And I get it,but I don't
think you really mean it.

492
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,630
You know what?

493
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:01,840
I think we need to get drunk
-- really,really good and drunk.

494
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,090
First,let me see the ring again.

495
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,510
I'll give you a designer's opinion.

496
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,620
I mean,it's really nice.

497
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,460
Well,congratulations!

498
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,970
Champagne on the house.

499
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,410
Um,it's -- we
have an engagement!

500
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,470
No.

501
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,910
Champagne on the house.

502
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,350
So,who knew that the ring trick would
get us free drinks all over midtown?

503
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,890
I know.

504
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,510
Can I give you two a ride?

505
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,220
Why not?

506
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,990
It is our engagement night.

507
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,910
In that case,the ride's free.

508
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,110
A diamond ring is gold!

509
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:06,170
So,what do you two have
planned for your lives together?

510
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:10,060
Um...we're gonna be a power couple.

511
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:13,820
He's gonna be a famous novelist,and
I'm gonna have a fabulous fashion line.

512
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,110
But we're still gonna have
time to have a big family.

513
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,420
Two boys and a girl.

514
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,690
And I'll coach little league.

515
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,020
Ooh,and I'll bake treats for the team!

516
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,430
Or buy them.

517
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,950
Then we'll spend our
summer in our beach house.

518
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,400
And winters in the south of france.

519
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,500
It won't matter where we are,
as long as we're together.

520
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,840
That's the key.

521
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,210
Success is wonderful,but finding someone
to love,having them love you back --

522
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,800
love is what it's all about.

523
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,180
All right,boozy.

524
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,400
Let's get you to bed.

525
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,970
Come on.

526
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,950
Here you go.

527
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,890
All right.

528
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,120
The bed is spinning.

529
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,030
You're gonna be okay.

530
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:03,720
I'm gonna get you into some jammies,
and then I'm gonna take a cab home,

531
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,820
and you can sleep it off.

532
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:08,860
-Come here.
-Or you could stay.

533
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,530
Okay.

534
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:19,750
I think that might be the second-stupidest
thing you've done in the last 24 hours.

535
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,500
Luke,we're not high school anymore.

536
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,620
And I love peyton.

537
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:28,220
And even if you don't want to
admit it right now,so do you.

538
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,690
Okay?

539
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,200
I feel...lost,brooke.

540
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,550
I don't know what to do without her.

541
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,920
All right.

542
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:40,090
You remember when I
started clothes over bro's?

543
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,820
It was right after we broke up,

544
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:46,240
and I was trying to mend my broken
heart by focusing on my work.

545
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,650
And you need to do the same right now.

546
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:53,330
You need to go out there and become the best
person and the best writer that you can be.

547
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,670
And then you approach peyton.

548
00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:01,880
And if she comes back to you,
you know it's meant to be.Okay?

549
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm gonna go,and you probably
won't see me for a while.

550
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:18,280
Lucas scott is gonna change the world
some day,and he doesn't even know it yet.

551
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,360
Bye,luke.

552
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,810
I've been calling you all night.

553
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,630
Maybe teen marriage is all the
rage in hicksville,north carolina.

554
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,570
But I swear,if you marry this boy,I'm gonna
have annulment papers drawn up so fast --

555
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,270
mom,relax.It was just a joke.

556
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,570
Oh.Thank god.

557
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:07,320
You have far too much to lose,brooke.

558
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:10,950
And lucas scott was the one
boy I might have lost it for.

559
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:15,250
You should be focusing on the
company -- not boys with rings.

560
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,630
But what about love,mom?

561
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,460
Isn't that the key?

562
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,880
In case you've forgotten,it's
called "clothes over bro'S.

563
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,490
" Right.

564
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,880
Okay,I'm in.

565
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:35,920
The high-end line,the magazine -- I'm
ready to take it to the next level.

566
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:39,770
Oh,I am so glad to hear you say that.

567
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:45,060
And I promise you,darling,we are gonna
have everything we've ever wanted.

568
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,330
And by the way,call me victoria.

569
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,240
That whole "mom" thing
just makes me sound too old.

570
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,790
say it again,buddy.

571
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,800
What is this,huh?

572
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,560
A ball.Ball.

573
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,440
Oh,see?I'm telling you -- the
kid's gonna be a rock star --

574
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,490
and a very well-behaved
rock star,right?

575
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,710
Hey,jamie.

576
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,580
Guitar.Guitar.

577
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,180
Ball.

578
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,440
Oh,that's not fair.

579
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,810
"Ball" is so much easier than "guitar.

580
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,870
" Haley,thank you
for supporting me --

581
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,600
for helping me get my dream back.

582
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,230
I love you so much.

583
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,550
I know you do.

584
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,870
I'm so proud of you.

585
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,290
We're gonna T.

586
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,430
Ke i and nothing's gonna
stop us now,huh,buddy?

587
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,640
Is it?Is it,jamie?

588
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,430
That's right.

589
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,090
Nothing,buddy.

590
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,270
Everybody pile on daddy!

591
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,720
Come on.Oh,no!

592
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,360
Come on in.

593
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,260
What's that?

594
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,340
It's,uh,bamboo.

595
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,230
It's supposed to bring luck.

596
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,860
Thanks,lucas.

597
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,860
I love it.

598
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,470
You know,I'm really looking
forward to us working together.

599
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,890
Me too.

600
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,140
Have a seat,okay?Be right back.

601
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,200
You still taking a
trip down memory lane?

602
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,930
Yeah,I guess.

603
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,010
Maybe you should put it on paper.

604
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,550
Might make us both some money.

605
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,810
Actually,uh... I was
thinking about taking a walk.

606
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,660
What are you doing?

607
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,220
Oh,just,uh,thought it was time to
get these out of jamie's closet.

608
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,910
He's proud of his daddy.

609
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,600
So am I.

610
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,940
That's the first cobras championship.

611
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,300
Yeah.

612
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,030
You were so great in that game.

613
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:57,710
You should never be ashamed
of your achievements,you know?

614
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:03,900
The only thing I'm ashamed of is the
person I've been for the past few months.

615
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:06,400
That's all gonna change.

616
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,850
Hey.

617
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:12,570
I know we're not the
couple we used to be.

618
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,320
We're gonna get there.

619
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,250
I know it.

620
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,640
this is a surprise.What's up?

621
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,930
Not much.Uh,is peyton around?

622
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,310
No.I think she's at the studio today.

623
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,320
You okay?

624
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,580
Yeah.You remember
that night in new york?

625
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:46,790
The night I found out
my book was published?

626
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,360
Sure.

627
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:51,160
It was the same night I went
into business with victoria.

628
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,080
You ever wonder if we
chose the right paths?

629
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,630
Sometimes.

630
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,970
But I have all these
wonderful things in my life --

631
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,160
things I wouldn't have had otherwise.

632
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,290
Oh,you're right.

633
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,260
I mean,me too.

634
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,750
I don't know.

635
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:11,260
Do you want me to tell
peyton you came by?

636
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,700
No,that's okay.Um...
I'll see you,brooke.

637
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,780
See ya.

638
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,140
-Luke.
-Yeah.

639
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,300
You still love her,don't you?

640
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,100
Peyton.

641
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,880
I got to get back to lindsey.

642
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,780
Right.

643
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,630
This is gonna get interesting.
