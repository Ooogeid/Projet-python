1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,700
Previously on "one tree hill"...

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,700
You need to
work hard, too, whoa!

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,800
You know, comeback.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,600
I'm gonna do this.

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,700
I am your mother.
I know.

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,900
You're fired.

7
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,700
I need a heart transplant.
I have six months to live.

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,700
My name is dan scott...

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,600
And my number is one.

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,400
If lindsey's the girl
that you're in love with, great.

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,500
If it's peyton, great.

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,000
If it's brooke, just please
stop hiding your heart.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,500
You asked me if i miss you.

14
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,400
Of course i miss you.

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,400
I love you, lucas scott.
You know that?

16
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,500
While i'm asleep,
i have this dream.

17
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,200
And you proposed to me.

18
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,000
And every single time,
i say yes.

19
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,700
One tree hill s06e01

20
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,900
Touch me i'm going to scream, part 1

21
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,400
Three simple cards.

22
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,700
Three beautiful ladies.

23
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,300
It's real simple, son.
All you got to do is pick one.

24
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,800
All right.

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,200
Just follow the heart.

26
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,900
Hey, handsome.

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,000
These are for you,
for our one-Year anniversary.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,400
Uh, brooke,
i'm your husband.

29
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,600
I'm supposed to give you flowers.

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,600
I know.

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,900
But i wanted to make sure
i'd like them.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,100
Well?

33
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,800
Happy anniversary, wife.

34
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,700
Thank you, husband.
I love them.

35
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,400
You ever miss tree hill?

36
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,500
Of course.
I miss my friends.

37
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,100
Jamie's getting big.
I never see him.

38
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,600
I know, but you have
the book tour,

39
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,900
And i have the company.

40
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,500
And...
i think he understands.

41
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,900
But what about
all that traveling?

42
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,300
I mean, i'm proud of you
and all, but...

43
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,900
It just sucks
that we're apart so much.

44
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,400
I know.

45
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,300
It makes coming home
kind of sexy, though.

46
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,600
Very true.

47
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,400
Hey.

48
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,900
I do love you,
brooke davis.

49
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,000
And i love you,
lucas davis...scott.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm gonna love you even more

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,400
When i see the exactly-What-I-Wanted gift
you got me for our anniversary.

52
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,200
You're gonna love that,
whatever it is.

53
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,800
Happy anniversary.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,300
Thank you.

55
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,100
Happy anniversary.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,600
Go back out!

57
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,100
Why, is the mailman
here again?

58
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,400
No, he just pulled on his pants
and jumped out the window,

59
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,100
But he did leave you
an anniversary gift,

60
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,000
And i haven't
wrapped it yet.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,200
Hi, babe.
Hi, wifey.

62
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,300
These are for you.

63
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,900
Oh, they're beautiful.
Thank you.

64
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,000
How was your day?

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,300
It was good.

66
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,500
It is good.

67
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,700
You know, i can't believe
it's been a year.

68
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,100
Time flies when you get
what you wish for.

69
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,000
Is it?

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,100
Is it what you wished for,
peyton?

71
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,200
If i say
it's more than that,

72
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,400
Are you gonna tease me
for being a dork?

73
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,500
'Cause it is.

74
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,300
Well, i made dinner reservations
for tonight if you want.

75
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:31,500
Actually, i was thinking maybe we could
just stay in and have a quiet dinner,

76
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,500
And there is a chance i could be rocking some slightly
dirty-Girl lingerie underneath these jeans.

77
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
I think i need to sit down.

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,400
Why?

79
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,700
You okay?

80
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,800
Yeah.

81
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,500
You look nice.

82
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,300
Thanks, but i still haven't
gotten ready yet.

83
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,700
Doesn't matter.

84
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,800
How come
after a year of marriage

85
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,600
You're still so sweet to me?

86
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,100
Because you're you.

87
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,700
And because you deserve it.

88
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,500
You make it
all too easy.

89
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,300
I better get ready.

90
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,500
Hey, linds.

91
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,600
It's easy with us,
isn't it?

92
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,200
Yeah.
It's the easiest.

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,400
There he is.

94
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
Come on now, son.

95
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,800
Three queens.
Three choices.

96
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Just follow the heart.

97
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,900
Come on, lucas.
Just pick one.

98
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,600
You got to pick one, luke.

99
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,900
You can do it, uncle lucas.

100
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,800
Pick one.

101
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,100
Pick one.

102
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,700
Just pick one.

103
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,100
That's the one.

104
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,400
You sure?

105
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,600
Well, well.

106
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,300
Looks like you found
your queen.

107
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,200
Not many do.

108
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,400
How did you know
which one to pick?

109
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,400
I guess i always knew.

110
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,400
Say what, son?

111
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,700
You said you always knew.
Knew what?

112
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,900
I'm sorry.

113
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,100
Uh...excuse me.

114
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,200
Oh, i got it.

115
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,600
There you go.

116
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,300
Let me give you
a hand here.

117
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,700
Hi, it's me.

118
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,500
Look, i'm at the airport,
and i got two tickets to vegas.

119
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,800
Do you want to get married
tonight?

120
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,700
You folks be careful.

121
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,500
You could get yourself killed
out here.

122
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,900
Getting married, huh?

123
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,300
I hope so.

124
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,100
I don't know.

125
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,500
We'll see if she shows up.

126
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,500
She'll show.

127
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,900
I want to tell you
something, son.

128
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,700
It's the most important thing
there is -- Love,

129
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:16,100
Finding the right person
to spend your life with.

130
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,100
I know
i made the right choice.

131
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,400
That's where they get you --
Thinking you got a choice.

132
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,600
Love finds you, son.
You don't find love.

133
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,400
It's got a little bit to do
with destiny, fate,

134
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,700
What's written
in the stars,

135
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,100
And a lot to do
th the simple fact

136
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,700
That most women
are smarter than we are.

137
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,800
And wily.

138
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,200
Your sorry butt
never had a chance.

139
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,000
But if you want to believe that
you had a choice in the matter,

140
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,500
I'd say you made a good one.

141
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
Why is that?

142
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,800
Because she showed up.

143
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,200
And she sure is pretty.

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,900
You are such a mess.

145
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,000
You can't just call a girl
from the airport.

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,200
Peyton,
i know this sounds crazy.

147
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,600
You're a mess,
lucas scott,

148
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,500
But you're my mess,
and i love you.

149
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,500
I ???

150
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,300
Because ???

151
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,000
S none of your business.

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,100
As a matter of fact,
none of my actual business

153
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,500
Is any of your business
because i fired you.

154
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,900
No, you were my mother.

155
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,900
I fired you from that job, too.

156
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,400
Look, i have to go.
Someone is at the door.

157
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
And don't bother
calling me back.

158
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Just talk to my lawyer.

159
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,900
I have nothing left
to say to you.

160
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,000
Bitch.

161
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,100
Well, i have a few things
to say to you.

162
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,300
Unbelievable!

163
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,600
I can't understand why you've become such
a hurtful, spiteful little snot to me.

164
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,700
But it is what it is.
I can take it.

165
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,700
Our company,
however, cannot.

166
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,900
Our company?

167
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,100
I'm sorry,
i believe it's my company,

168
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,500
Because you were fired,

169
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,200
And i do not recall
inviting you in,

170
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,900
You botoxed vampiress.

171
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,200
You see?
This is what i'm talking about.

172
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,000
You're such a child,
and a fairly stupid one at that.

173
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,700
It doesn't matter
that you fired me.

174
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,300
I'm your legal partner,
missy.

175
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,600
It's my company.
I'm the designer.

176
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,200
No, it's our company --
50-50.

177
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,100
At least it is for now.

178
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,500
And what is that
supposed to mean?

179
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,000
Designers come and go.

180
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,600
It's the brand that matters,
and i grow the brand.

181
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,000
And the board knows that,
and they can fire you.

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,700
So, what?

183
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,100
You're gonna have a magazine
called "b. Davis"

184
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,800
Without b. Davis?

185
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,200
Paul frank
doesn't work for paul frank.

186
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,400
Happens all the time.

187
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,200
Really?

188
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,500
And what are you gonna sell,
mother?

189
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,100
Magic beans?

190
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,400
Without my designs,
you have nothing.

191
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,500
I know it. You know it.

192
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,400
And as soon as the board
sees my unbelievable new line,

193
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,500
They'll know it.

194
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,700
And you'll be the one who's out
on her nip-And-Tucked ass.

195
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,100
We'll see about that.

196
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,400
Get out of my house.

197
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,300
I hope this new line

198
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,900
Is by far the best work
you've ever done,

199
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,700
Or it's "goodbye, company,
hello, community college."

200
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,700
If you can get in.

201
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,900
This is ridiculous,
the way we have to sneak around.

202
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah.

203
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We're making out in a car
like high-School kids.

204
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,600
Yeah, but personally, you did
rock that cheerleading outfit.

205
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,400
Not the point,
but thank you.

206
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,100
Oh.
Okay.

207
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,200
You right.

208
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,000
We just gonna have to go public.
Yeah.

209
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,200
I'm gonna say, "nate, look
i'm dating your mom --

210
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,700
Sleeping with her, doing all
kind of freaky stuff to her."

211
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,200
So, you want to tell him,
or should i?

212
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,800
Sneaking around
is kind of hot.

213
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

214
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Hi, buddy.
What you doing?

215
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,800
Working on an idea
for clothes over bros

216
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,700
That's totally gonna fix
brooke's inventory problems.

217
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,300
Are you okay?

218
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,300
I quit my job.

219
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,600
Okay.

220
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
You know what?
It's their loss.

221
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,300
Thank you.

222
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,500
Can i ask you something?

223
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,800
Were you serious
about moving with me to omaha?

224
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,100
Yes.

225
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,600
Well, they have
that sports job for me,

226
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,300
But i have to be there
in three days.

227
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,900
I'll tell brooke
i'm leaving.

228
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,000
I know it's sudden,
millie.

229
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,400
It's okay.

230
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:25,100
She'll understand.
Life's sudden sometimes.

231
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,400
I know it's sudden.

232
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,000
This is real, isn't it?

233
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,100
Yeah.

234
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,400
Tell me again.

235
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,900
Yes, it's real.

236
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,400
Good.

237
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,200
I'm glad.

238
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,900
And if it's not,

239
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't know if i ever
want to wake up from this.

240
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,300
Oh, good,
you're awake.

241
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I was worried that
when i hit you with that car

242
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,600
That i might have
killed you.

243
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,900
Put ???

244
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,000
Oh, luke.
You're such a dork.

245
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,300
We're not even
married yet.

246
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,900
I know,
but i wanted to practice

247
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,800
So that when we are,
i don't look like a dork.

248
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,500
Well,
good luck with that.

249
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,000
Oh, no!

250
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,100
There's a mirror
on the ceiling.

251
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,000
It's so romantic.

252
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,700
I told them something nice,
not something -- Oh --

253
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,600
Sketchy.

254
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,100
It's vegas, luke.

255
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,300
Look at you.

256
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,600
What?

257
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,900
You fly all night,
and you still look amazing.

258
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,300
Oh, god.
No, i don't.

259
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,500
Yeah...

260
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,800
You do.

261
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,500
You tired?

262
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,800
No. I've never felt more awake.

263
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,500
Good. Me neither.

264
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,100
Hey, come here.

265
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:42,900
I could live off of that.
I miss that.

266
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,700
And i think your ass

267
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,900
Is gonna look really great
in that mirror.

268
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,100
Let's find out.

269
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,500
You're just dreaming
now. You know that?

270
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,300
Nba's a pipe dream, son.
Might as well give it up.

271
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,200
No, it's not.
I'm nathan scott.

272
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,000
Oh!

273
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,700
Two points.

274
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,200
Hey, mama!
What?

275
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,500
You should have seen daddy
last night.

276
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,400
He's gonna play in the nba
for sure.

277
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,100
Oh, we'll see, huh?

278
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,900
Hey, listen, um,
i was talking to chester,

279
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,100
And apparently
he hasn't been fed this morning.

280
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,100
He always tells on me.

281
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,800
You better get our of here,
you wascally wabbit feeder.

282
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
Go.

283
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Making progress
on the court, huh?

284
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,600
Yeah -- Last night.

285
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,200
For the first time,
i, uh...

286
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,900
I felt like
i was on my way back.

287
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm so glad for you,
nathan.

288
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,700
How you doing
in the studio?

289
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,100
Good.

290
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,600
Last night,
for the first time,

291
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,500
I felt like
i was on my way back.

292
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,700
That's my girl.

293
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,700
It's not that i don't love
working for you, because i do.

294
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,700
I mean, we have fun, and you're
always in a good mood.

295
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,200
Oh, my god!
I am so pissed off right now!

296
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,900
Why, what's wrong?

297
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,600
Oh, victoria's dna,
apparently.

298
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,100
She is like a science experiment
gone wrong.

299
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,600
Frankenmom -- She shows up
at my house last night.

300
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,700
She's here?
Oh, yeah.

301
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,500
And she informs me that
she's taking my company from me.

302
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,200
Can she do that?

303
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,000
Legally, yes,
but it is so not gonna happen.

304
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,100
Where are my designs?

305
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,100
In the cabinet.

306
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,000
Okay.
I want you to lock it.

307
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,500
Change the passwords
on the computer again.

308
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,200
She's not getting
anywhere near the new line.

309
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,600
And when i show it to the board
and explain to them

310
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,000
That i am the one who closed
the deal on "baby brooke,"

311
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,700
Her little reign of terror
is gonna be over, my friend.

312
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm sorry. We're gonna
fight her, millie.

313
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Me and you together --
We're gonna fight her.

314
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,700
Okay. Yeah.
Um, the thing is --

315
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,600
T--
Not today.

316
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,900
Hi. Can i help you
with something?

317
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,000
Uh, no thanks.

318
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,300
I have to be honest
with you.

319
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,000
I really don't think
that's your best color.

320
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What?
The top you just stole from me.

321
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Okay, i don't know
what you're talking about.

322
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,900
Really?

323
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,600
What are you doing?!
Hey!

324
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,500
Shoplift much?

325
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,200
Look, i didn't...

326
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,000
I didn't mean to.

327
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,600
You didn't mean to?
Okay.

328
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,900
You're gonna need to come
with me.

329
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,600
Get off me, bitch!
Hey!

330
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,500
Brooke, are you okay?

331
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,500
It is just
not my frigging day.

332
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,200
There it is. Up.
Off the glass.

333
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,100
Whoop! It's pretty!
Ow!

334
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,400
What you got?
You getting up?

335
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,700
Hey!

336
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,700
Uh-Oh. My man.

337
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,300
What's up, boy?
Give me one more.

338
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,500
Oh, there it is.

339
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,000
Hey, let me throw
j. Scott up there,

340
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,400
And one of y'all dunk him.
You got it?

341
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
While the cat's away,
huh?

342
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,200
Nah, they just having
some fun.

343
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,300
Why, what's with you?

344
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,400
Well, apparently,

345
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,900
My mom's dating some freak
she met online.

346
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,700
Really?

347
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,100
Yeah.
Can you believe that?

348
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,500
Why he got to be a freak,
though?

349
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,400
I mean,
maybe he's a nice guy.

350
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
Right.

351
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,300
Nice porn-Site man.

352
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,300
Guy's probably got
a mustache.

353
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,400
I'll tell you what,
skills.

354
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,100
My mom's
pill addiction was bad,

355
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,700
But @oking up
with some internet tool, man,

356
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,500
This just
really takes the cake.

357
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,600
Yeah, but she seem
happy though, right?

358
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,700
You know...satisfied?

359
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,800
Dude...

360
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,400
Did you just ask me
if my mom was satisfied?

361
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,600
Nah, you know,
i meant, like, happy,

362
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,300
Like she's
into the dude.

363
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,500
It doesn't matter.
It's embarrassing.

364
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,500
I'll tell you
one thing --

365
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,200
I'm gonna find out
who this jerk is.

366
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,200
And when i do,
it's gonna get ugly.

367
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,700
Hey, baller, come here.

368
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,900
Yeah, boy.
Come on, you ready?

369
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,700
All right,
do what i do, all right?

370
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,700
Hit the showers.

371
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,600
Yeah, let me get that.

372
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,300
Hey, hey, nate.
Come on, man.

373
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,700
Let's show 'em
how it's done old school.

374
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,400
Old school, huh?
Let's do this.

375
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,200
Unh! What's up?!
What's up?!

376
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,100
There it is!

377
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Hey!

378
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,800
Welcome
to clothes over br--

379
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,700
Well, well...
the slavic bag lady.

380
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,100
Can i help you?

381
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,600
As a matter of fact,
you can.

382
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,000
I need to see the sketches for the new line.
Okay.

383
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,500
I'll just call brooke.

384
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,800
I'm an equal partner
in this company

385
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,300
And, as such, have equal rights
to those sketches.

386
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,900
Actually, that's not true.

387
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,000
Or maybe it is, but...

388
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,300
Well, the thing is,

389
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,200
Brooke doesn't want you
to see the line,

390
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,800
And brooke's my boss,
so i'm afraid i can't help you.

391
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,900
Can't or won't?

392
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,400
Won't.

393
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,400
You don't like me, do you?

394
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,500
No.
Because you feel i've mistreated you.

395
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,300
No.

396
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,600
Because
you're an evil bitch.

397
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,400
You're gonna payor that.

398
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,700
I wouldn't
recommend that.

399
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,800
I mean,
broken leg, broken ribs.

400
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,400
It's gonna be a little hard
for you to speak for a while.

401
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,600
Quite a bit of trauma
to your throat.

402
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,600
And if you can't speak...

403
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,900
You ???

404
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,500
Do you know her?

405
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,200
No
it's okay.

406
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,300
I was hoping you might
recognize her from school.

407
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,700
It's hard to tell
from that.

408
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,600
It sucks that you had to
go through that. I'm sorry.

409
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,100
It's fine. In the grand scheme
of things i have to deal with,

410
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,400
This is really nothing.

411
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,700
Why,
what else is going on?

412
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,500
Oh, do you remember someone
by the name of victoria davis?

413
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,100
???

414
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,000
Yeah. It's okay.
Me, too.

415
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,100
I actually wanted to tell you
and peyton about it at the same time.

416
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,100
Is she here?

417
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,600
I have not seen her.

418
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,700
She didn't come home
last night.

419
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,900
I don't know
if i should be worried.

420
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,600
Well, apparently not.

421
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,600
"Don't worry about me.
I'm fine."

422
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,900
Peyton.

423
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,000
"Don't worry about me.
I'm fine."

424
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,000
Well, at least
she's being thorough.

425
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,600
Oh, it's not from her.

426
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,200
What?

427
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,300
Lucas.

428
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,600
No!

429
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,600
Okay, uh, responsible

430
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,100
"I have not been attacked by
psycho derek" text message sent.

431
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Good.

432
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,100
Responsible
"i know i've been dark lately,

433
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,000
But everything's okay"
message sent.

434
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,000
Oh...

435
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,300
It's from you. Hmm.

436
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,300
"Peyton, i love you.

437
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,300
Let's go get married.
Lucas."

438
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,300
Can a text message
change your life?

439
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,400
God, i hope so.

440
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,300
What?

441
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,800
I just can't believe

442
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,200
You actually had
your very own psycho stalker.

443
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,100
Shut up.

444
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,600
It's weird.

445
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,800
Still here.

446
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,100
Did you think
it was a nightmare?

447
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,900
Because it is for you.

448
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,700
You know...

449
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,500
When i think how jamie and i
would be together right now

450
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,800
If it wasn't for you --

451
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,600
Well, it wasn't very nice
what you said to me in that hotel room.

452
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,700
You said
if ever came back,

453
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,500
If i ever came near jamie,

454
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,900
You'd kill me.

455
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,100
Didn't you?

456
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,000
You strangled me,
and you took jamie.

457
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,100
And i suppose you thought
that was the last of me.

458
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,600
But it wasn't.

459
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,700
I've been watching you
with jamie.

460
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,100
I've been biding my time.

461
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,500
And now, well...

462
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,900
Here we are.

463
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,900
Mom.

464
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,100
Oh, for god's sakes, mom.

465
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,000
What?

466
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,400
What is going on
with you?

467
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,700
Is this some kind
of grandmother midlife crisis?

468
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,900
Would you keep it down, please?
The neighbors will hear you.

469
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,100
She's a grandmother.
My mom is a grandmother.

470
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,300
Nathan, stop it.

471
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,900
Just...

472
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,000
Just go away.

473
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,700
I want to know who he is,
mom -- Mr. Porno.

474
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,000
Give me a name.
No.

475
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,900
Why?

476
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,400
Because i want to know
who's responsible

477
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,800
For you losing your mind
like this.

478
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,700
Oh.
I'm gonna find out.

479
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,200
And put some clothes on.

480
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,100
Jamie's home.

481
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,100
If he sees you topless,
he's gonna be scarred for life.

482
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,500
I know i am.

483
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,800
Man, that was close.
I told you this was a bad idea.

484
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,900
Shh.
Where's my top?

485
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,100
You got to go.
You got to go.

486
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,000
You got to go.

487
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,900
I can't go.

488
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,200
What? Why?

489
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,400
Victoria.

490
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,100
Ohh. I just got chills
when you said that.

491
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
She's trying to take the company
from brooke.

492
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,400
Can she do that?

493
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,300
Apparently, she can,

494
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,100
And i told her
you were leaving,

495
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,200
And she thinks
i'm going with you,

496
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,900
But brooke needs me
right now.

497
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,400
She's been so good to me.

498
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,500
Yeah.

499
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,500
Hey...

500
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,000
I love you...

501
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,300
And i want to be with you,
and i will, but --

502
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,000
You stay,

503
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,400
And i'll get us settled
in omaha.

504
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,500
It's the right thing to do
for brooke.

505
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,100
But it's really gonna hurt.

506
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,200
The funny thing
about painkillers --

507
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,600
It's such
a delicate balance.

508
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,100
Not enough morphine,

509
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,500
And you'd be in horrible,
agonizing discomfort.

510
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,100
Too much, and...
well, you'd be dead.

511
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,600
Your head must be spinning
right now.

512
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,800
How did jamie's sweet nanny
carrie get to be your nurse?

513
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,400
Well, rest assured,
i am a very good caretaker.

514
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,700
When my father got sick,

515
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,700
I had to move in
and do everything --

516
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,200
Feed him, bathe him,
medicine.

517
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,300
I mean, eventually he died,
but still.

518
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,900
Anyway, what's it gonna be?

519
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,800
Dead...

520
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,400
Or agony?

521
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,400
Agony.

522
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,700
For now,
but pretty soon...

523
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,300
Dead

524
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,800
Hey.
Oh, hey, baby.

525
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,500
What the heck is this?

526
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,600
Uh, i don't know.

527
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,300
Q's teaching him
some dance move.

528
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
Hi, mama.
Pretty cool, huh?

529
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,500
Yeah,
that's pretty cool,

530
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,300
Preon upstairs and wash up for dinner,
usher.

531
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,800
Okay.

532
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,400
Oh.

533
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,600
Where's deb?

534
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,100
Last time i saw her, she was
swimming topless in the pool.

535
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,300
What?
Yeah.

536
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,500
Oh.

537
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,300
God, what is with you
and naked nannies in the pool?

538
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,200
Sorry.

539
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,800
So, how are things
in the studio?

540
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,200
Is peyton
pulling out of her funk?

541
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,300
Peyton was out all night
with lucas.

542
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,800
Is that right?
Mm-Hmm.

543
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,800
And what do you suppose
they were doing?

544
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,500
Lucas.

545
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,300
White-Trash,
vegas wedding material.

546
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,800
Heart-Skips-A-Beat,
breathtaking material.

547
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,100
You are...

548
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,900
I don't have a ring.

549
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,700
Peyton, i'm sorry, i --

550
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,800
Look. Here.
This ring was my mom's.

551
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,200
I know it's...selfish --

552
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,000
You know,
getting married like this.

553
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,100
No friends, no family,
no ring.

554
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,300
It's okay.

555
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,800
But i want to be selfish
with you.

556
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,300
And it's been
way too long.

557
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,300
And life just always
seems to get in the way with us.

558
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,200
And i know
this is las vegas,

559
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,400
And it's not exactly
how you imagined it.

560
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,400
But it's gonna be romantic.
I promise.

561
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,300
This isn't right.

562
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,200
No, it's okay. It is.
I just want to be your wife.

563
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,900
Peyton, i want that, too.
I do, but, i mean...

564
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,700
What the hell
was i thinking?

565
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,500
I mean, this is supposed to be
a dream come true, not...

566
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,600
...this.

567
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,800
Hey.

568
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,700
I got an idea.
You trust me?

569
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,300
Looking like this,
whatever you want.

570
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,700
Good. Come on.

571
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,800
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

572
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,200
Brooke? Hi.
Hi.

573
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,700
I just wanted to stop by
and...

574
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,500
Are you leaving me,
marvin mcfadden?

575
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,900
I guess so.

576
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I found this
while i was packing.

577
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,700
The boy toy auction.

578
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,400
Beginning of a beautiful
friendship right here.

579
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,800
For most of my life,

580
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,500
That was the greatest night
of my life.

581
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,400
<i>Most of your life?
Who topped me?</i>

582
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,100
Millicent...

583
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,000
The night
she said she loved me.

584
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,500
Yeah.

585
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,700
I'm glad
she's gonna be with you.

586
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,400
Actually,
she'll be with you.

587
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,400
What do --

588
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,200
She told me
about victoria.

589
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,200
Which is my problem
to deal with, not yours.

590
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,800
She can come to omaha
when things settle down for you.

591
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,700
She wants to help you,
brooke.

592
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,900
When do you go?

593
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,500
Tonight. I have to.

594
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,400
Okay, hug me before i cry.

595
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,200
Goodbye, scarecrow.

596
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,100
I'm gonna miss you
most of all.

597
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,600
You, too, brooke davis.

598
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,700
All right.

599
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,900
Get out of here.

600
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,700
Bye.

601
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,900
Well, well.

602
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,600
Where ???

603
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,300
I love that laugh.
I missed it.

604
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,800
Yeah?
Yeah.

605
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,500
Me, too.

606
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,400
Peyton sawyer
will be peyton scott.

607
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,100
What are you whispering
about, wily?

608
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Nothing.

609
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,900
Everything.
More than everything.

610
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,400
Hi.

611
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You're fired.

612
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,800
What?

613
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
You're fired.

614
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,600
Now go to omaha.

615
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,500
Brooke --

616
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,500
Let me tell you something
about love, millicent huxtable.

617
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,200
It does not knock often.

618
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,400
And when it does,
you have to let it in.

619
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,500
You are a wonderful friend.

620
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
And you're smart
and you're beautiful

621
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,100
And it is gonna suck
to lose you,

622
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,400
But there is a boy out there
who loves you.

623
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,900
And i know
that you love him back.

624
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,600
So, now you have to get
your wacky ass out of my store.

625
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,700
But --

626
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,100
I'm gonna be fine.

627
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
Okay?

628
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,300
If you need anything --

629
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,700
I just
need you to be happy.

630
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,900
I hate goodbyes.

631
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,800
Okay.

632
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,600
Go.
Bye.

633
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,800
Taking one last look,
huh?

634
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,700
Yeah.

635
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,000
I was hoping
luke might be here.

636
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,000
I tried calling him
to say goodbye, but...

637
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,800
I got to go.

638
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,300
Yeah, and from
the looks of things,

639
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,100
He has some stuff
to figure out, too.

640
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,500
I'll tell him
you said goodbye, though.

641
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,700
You know
he proud of you, right?

642
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,200
We all are.

643
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,400
Thanks, skills.

644
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,700
Well, i guess i should finish
packing and get out of here.

645
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,300
You go do your thing...

646
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,100
Marvin mcfadden,
my brother.

647
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,300
Hey, skills.

648
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,900
We grew up here,
didn't we?

649
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,200
I'm gonna miss this place.

650
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,000
You turned my son
into a goof, q.

651
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,000
Well, just so you know,
i know your back's been hurting,

652
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,300
So i been taking it
a little easy on you.

653
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,500
My back's fine.

654
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,000
Please. How fine?

655
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,000
This fine.

656
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,500
Okay,
open your eyes.

657
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,100
This is the room where --

658
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,600
You proposed to me
four years ago.

659
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,800
Yeah.

660
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,100
You said it should be
like a dream, so...

661
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,000
I have this dream

662
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,000
Where we're back
in this hotel room,

663
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,400
And you propose to me,

664
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,200
And every single time,
i say yes.

665
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,500
It's just a dream, right?

666
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,300
But it's my dream.

667
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,500
Hi.
I don't want to leave you.

668
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,800
What if i said
you didn't have to?

669
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,800
Really?

670
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,100
You're coming to omaha?

671
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,400
If you'll still have me.

672
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
All right, you dancing fool,
it's time for bed.

673
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,300
And you, too, jamie.
Ha ha.

674
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
Goodbye.

675
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,700
Good night, baby.

676
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,900
Good night, mama.
I love you.

677
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:17,900
Hey, daddy,

678
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,900
When you play in the nba,
you should play for the bobcats.

679
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,000
That way, you can come home
a lot more

680
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,000
And see me and mama,

681
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,200
Plus, q says they need
a shooting guard.

682
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,500
Q, huh?

683
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,000
You and q. Come here.

684
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,700
It's me.

685
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,500
I've been thinking
about our little partnership,

686
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,100
And i've come to a decision.

687
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,000
<i>I am this company.</i>

688
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,100
<i>I am the reason
it is successful.</i>

689
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,100
Do you understand me?

690
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,700
So if you want a fight,
you got it.

691
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,200
Disappointed you spoiled
my surprise so soon.

692
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,100
What do you have to say
for yourself, mr. Murderer?

693
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,100
I've been planning this
for some time now.

694
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,500
First, i hit you with the borrowed car
and took your wallet,

695
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,500
Wheeled john doe
out of recovery.

696
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,400
It all happened so fast.

697
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,800
There was so much blood
and chaos,

698
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,400
No one took the time
to i.D. You.

699
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,600
Guess it helps
that their beloved mayor

700
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,300
Has been in prison
for the past four years.

701
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,400
Carefully put you
into your own car,

702
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,800
And now here we are.

703
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,600
Most of this stuff
was daddy's before he died.

704
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,200
The paint and the curtains
was just to mess with your head.

705
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,200
See...

706
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Eventually, i am going to do
the world a favor and kill you.

707
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,100
But first,
i'm gonna get jamie back.

708
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,900
And you're gonna help me,
aren't you, grandpa dan?

709
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,300
Yes, you are.

710
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,500
Yes. Good boy.

711
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,900
