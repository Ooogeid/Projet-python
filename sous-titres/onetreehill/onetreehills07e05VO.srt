1
00:00:00,434 --> 00:00:02,501
What's a love child?

2
00:00:02,901 --> 00:00:04,734
Did I not ask you to look

3
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:06,367
into the Nathan Scott situation
to find out if there was a story?

4
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:08,801
Right now, it's nothing but a
rumor in some low-rent tabloid.

5
00:00:08,867 --> 00:00:11,300
That's not fair, and it's not what I do.

6
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:12,734
Yeah, just keep walking, McFadden.

7
00:00:12,801 --> 00:00:14,500
You're off the air!

8
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:15,767
Where is Makenna?

9
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:17,333
Millie can handle it.

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,534
She can take Makenna's place.

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,001
There's an after after party

12
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:22,534
that nobody's invited to except us.

13
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,667
You're going.

14
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:26,567
Say "yes."

15
00:00:26,634 --> 00:00:28,667
Yes.
Yes!

16
00:00:28,734 --> 00:00:31,101
I wouldn't mind meeting with
the writer. I got a few ideas.

17
00:00:31,168 --> 00:00:32,534
I wrote it.

18
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,168
If you're serious about this, I'd be willing

19
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,734
to work with you on it,
but only if you're committed.

20
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:38,967
I would love to commit to you, Julian.

21
00:00:39,034 --> 00:00:40,400
I'm sorry, David.

22
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:42,567
I think we should get a divorce.

23
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:44,367
Where to?

24
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:45,700
Your place.

25
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:48,067
Just drive.

26
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:50,433
What are you doing here?
He doesn't love you.

27
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,667
You don't know what you're
talking about, sweetie.

28
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:54,433
He told me while we were making love.

29
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,568
Maybe I am a slut,

30
00:01:08,634 --> 00:01:10,668
but that's what Nathan liked about me.

31
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:12,833
He had me do all kinds of things to him

32
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,601
that he said you would never... 

33
00:01:14,668 --> 00:01:15,900
that's the only hit to come

34
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:17,467
out of rock star Haley james Scott

35
00:01:17,534 --> 00:01:18,934
in five years.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,167
Let's see that again!

37
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:23,700
He had me do all kinds of things to
him that he said you would never... 

38
00:01:25,934 --> 00:01:27,634
Well, I suppose there's worse things

39
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,134
than hitting a pregnant woman.

40
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:30,800
Yeah? Like what?

41
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:31,934
Let's see that again!

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,867
Just give me a second.

43
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:35,267
...that he said you would never.

44
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:36,568
Mm.

45
00:01:36,634 --> 00:01:38,401
Good slap, though.

46
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:40,934
Thank God Jamie and Quinn
aren't awake to see this.

47
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,634
It's okay.

48
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:49,601
It's a long walk of shame from here to Nate's.

49
00:01:49,668 --> 00:01:51,867
You might want to eat something first.

50
00:01:51,934 --> 00:01:53,900
Yeah, I was just gonna
grab a cab of shame,

51
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:55,267
so, I'm good, but thank you.

52
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:56,568
You know, I can drive you.

53
00:01:56,668 --> 00:01:58,767
You know, it's cheaper
than a cab of shame

54
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,267
and comes with a free meal.

55
00:02:00,334 --> 00:02:03,434
It's more the driver that
I'm worried about, so...

56
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:05,234
Did I mention I made breakfast burritos?

57
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:08,733
I do like breakfast burritos.

58
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,934
Mm-hmm.

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,900
I make a mean breakfast burrito.

60
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:17,568
Have you seen Alex's script?
I'm working with her today.

61
00:02:19,334 --> 00:02:20,634
Ohh. Sorry.

62
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,100
Good morning, Brooke Davis.

63
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:24,867
You get sexier and younger every day.

64
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:27,867
Well, good morning, babe.
 You're so sweet.

65
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:32,700
So, have you seen her script?

66
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:35,967
You certainly do know
how to hit the off switch.

67
00:02:36,034 --> 00:02:38,434
Sorry, babe, but you know
I'm working with her today.

68
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:40,467
Yeah. I'm not so sure
that's a good idea.

69
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:41,967
I don't trust her around men.

70
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:44,034
She's like one of those
herpes from mythology.

71
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,800
You mean "harpies"?

72
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:47,668
No, actually, I don't.

73
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,467
Her underwear should be a welcome mat,

74
00:02:49,534 --> 00:02:51,234
and I've seen the way she looks at you.

75
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:53,733
Can't you find a better script,
written by an uglier person?

76
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,733
Trust me, I'm not interested in the writer.

77
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,134
I'm interested in the story.

78
00:02:57,201 --> 00:02:59,334
As long as it doesn't become the story

79
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:01,301
you and Alex tell your kids someday

80
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:02,733
when they ask how you met.

81
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:09,601
Hey.

82
00:03:09,668 --> 00:03:13,100
The only kids I'll be telling stories to...

83
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:14,668
will be ours.

84
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:19,067
That's a good answer.

85
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:33,134
Have a good day.

86
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:44,934
Have a good night?

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,601
Marvin. You scared me.

88
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:49,867
Well, then, I guess we're even,
then. where have you been?

89
00:03:49,934 --> 00:03:51,234
It was such a crazy night.

90
00:03:51,301 --> 00:03:52,601
One of the models passed out,

91
00:03:52,668 --> 00:03:54,301
so Brooke let me go up in her place.

92
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,568
You modeled?

93
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:57,100
Yeah. Can you believe it?

94
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:58,767
And then Alex wanted to celebrate,

95
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,134
so we went out for a few drinks,

96
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:01,800
and I guess I just lost track of time.

97
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,267
Weren't you tipped off
when the sun came up?

98
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:06,134
You never even called.

99
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:07,401
I know, and I'm really sorry,

100
00:04:07,467 --> 00:04:08,967
but can we talk about it at lunch?

101
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:10,234
I'm late for work.

102
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:12,967
I really am sorry.

103
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,568
I'm not seeing the licorice whips.

104
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:22,434
Oh, I must have forgotten to order more.

105
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:25,668
I... I'm sorry, Mr. Scott.

106
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,501
Hey. I forgive you.

107
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:41,267
"Nathan Scott: a basketball
star's love child."

108
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:44,334
Like father, like son, huh?

109
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:55,301
So, I guess, since
you're playing video games,

110
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:56,833
you've already brushed your teeth, huh?

111
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,067
You know it.

112
00:04:58,134 --> 00:04:59,467
If you're lying,

113
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:01,800
the tooth police will come
and take your teeth away.

114
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:03,434
That's right, and then everyone's

115
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:04,767
gonna call you "gummy Scott."

116
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,668
Right.

117
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:12,134
I'll get it.

118
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:18,800
I'll brush! I'll brush!

119
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:21,034
Haley Scott?

120
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,733
You're under arrest for assault and battery.

121
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,367
Please turn around.
Excuse me?!

122
00:05:24,434 --> 00:05:25,434
Put your hands behind your back.

123
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:27,000
You're not arresting my wife.

124
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:28,568
You need to step away, sir.

125
00:05:28,634 --> 00:05:29,767
Are you serious?

126
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:30,967
...in the court of law.

127
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:32,467
You have the right to an attorney.

128
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,234
Oh, you guys are real heroes, aren't you?

129
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:37,967
Mom!

130
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:39,634
It's okay, baby. Go inside.
I'll be home later.

131
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:41,733
Haley, we're right behind you.
Okay? Don't worry.

132
00:05:59,201 --> 00:06:01,700
I bet you charge a lot for
that innocent-mommy look, huh?

133
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:03,234
What?

134
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:04,501
Hey, I know you.

135
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:07,301
My husband showed me your clip
on the internet last night,

136
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:08,834
then he got an I.M. from some dirty skank,

137
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,834
so I smashed him over the
head with a keyboard.

138
00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:13,534
She was on the internet?
What did she do?

139
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:16,167
Bitch-slapped some pregnant chick.

140
00:06:17,634 --> 00:06:19,400
That is cold.

141
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:31,534
You know, this has been quite
the bonus for spending the night.

142
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:33,267
So, what kind of feast would you make me

143
00:06:33,334 --> 00:06:34,467
if I spent the whole weekend?

144
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:37,133
Probably something to go.

145
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:40,934
So, did you learn to cook
just to impress women?

146
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,567
Something like that.

147
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:48,001
Does your phone ever stop buzzing?

148
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:50,734
Because I only have one thing
that vibrates that much.

149
00:06:51,968 --> 00:06:53,467
They're all business calls.

150
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:55,801
Oh, really? Okay.
All business calls. Let's see.

151
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:59,233
Hmm. Katie, Alex, Faith.

152
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,767
Ooh, Melissa, Kylie.

153
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:02,267
So, you're a pimp?

154
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:03,434
Mm.

155
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,701
Let's see who your last five calls are.

156
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,367
David, David...

157
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:12,233
David, David.

158
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,400
David.

159
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,068
Sorry.

160
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:19,334
Make you a deal.

161
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,867
I'll turn off mine if you turn off yours.

162
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,034
Deal.

163
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:30,601
This is Clay. Leave a message.

164
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,500
Clay, where the hell are you?
Haley's been arrested!

165
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,567
Call me back!

166
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:38,934
Aunt Quinn isn't in her room,

167
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:41,167
and she made her bed
just like mom makes it.

168
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:43,434
It doesn't even look like she slept in there.

169
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,901
So, after you read me the numbers,

170
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:51,367
I write them down in this book.

171
00:07:51,434 --> 00:07:52,801
Got it?

172
00:07:52,867 --> 00:07:54,968
Actually, I came up with
the whole logging system

173
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:56,467
when I first started.

174
00:07:56,534 --> 00:07:59,100
They, uh, they used to
call it the Marvin method.

175
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:01,367
We call it logging tapes.

176
00:08:01,434 --> 00:08:05,068
So, did, uh, Harvey explain the job to you?

177
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:08,233
I believe he came up with
the logging method himself.

178
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,267
Now, of course, you could
be a real reporter again

179
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:13,667
if you just read the stories we give you.

180
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:16,834
I am a real reporter. That's
why I don't report gossip.

181
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:18,500
Fine.

182
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,701
Well, just keep logging it instead.

183
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:31,001
I'm so sorry I'm late! Please don't kill me!

184
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:34,634
Okay! Please don't have sex with me, either.

185
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:35,767
You are not gonna believe this!

186
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:38,901
You were a huge hit last night!

187
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:40,200
Huge!

188
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:43,001
They think I look ordinary.

189
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:45,734
No, they think you're amazing...

190
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:48,068
"beautiful, sexy, smokin' hot."

191
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:50,601
This person thinks I
look like a turd sandwich!

192
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:52,300
Okay. You can't focus
on one negative comment.

193
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:54,400
This person agrees!
Well, then, listen to me!

194
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,233
I think you're gorgeous!

195
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,034
You don't think I look like

196
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,334
"a frumpy whore on bingo night"?

197
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,634
No!

198
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:03,300
If I did, would I ask you to model full time?

199
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:07,133
We want to do a whole line
based on "zero is not a size."

200
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,534
I mentioned the idea to Victoria,

201
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:09,801
and she jumped on it so fast,

202
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:11,200
you'd think it was Julian's dad.

203
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:13,233
I'm not a model.

204
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,133
But you were last night.

205
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,001
Did you like it or not?

206
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:18,901
Yeah, I did.
Well, there you go.

207
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:20,400
Alex isn't a model, either,

208
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:22,500
and that's not stopping her
from taking my money.

209
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:24,167
Yeah, but Alex is a lot sexier than me.

210
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,534
Hi, Julian!

211
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,467
You ready to give me notes?

212
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:32,567
Yes. Here's my first one... get dressed.

213
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:34,868
Oh.
I'm sorry.

214
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:36,967
I just got caught up watching "Grease 2."

215
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:38,434
Does that ever happen to you?

216
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:40,467
Yes.

217
00:09:40,534 --> 00:09:43,334
Come on in. I'll be ready in a sec.

218
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:51,100
Ohh.

219
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:53,100
I thought you were getting dressed!

220
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:55,534
I did. See?

221
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:56,967
No.

222
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:58,334
At least it's not a welcome mat.

223
00:09:58,401 --> 00:09:59,967
I wore them when I auditioned
for "Wonder woman,"

224
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,567
but I didn't get the part.

225
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,033
Does that mean they're bad luck?

226
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,134
Maybe I should take them off.
No, no, no, no!

227
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,267
No.

228
00:10:06,334 --> 00:10:07,868
I can't believe I'm saying this,

229
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:09,768
but you need to put more clothes on.

230
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:12,567
Why? It's not like they're
crotchless or edible.

231
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:14,634
Because if I work with you in yours,

232
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:16,768
I'll never see Brooke in hers again.

233
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:19,567
Oh, my God. You're so cute.

234
00:10:19,634 --> 00:10:20,801
I just want to hug you.

235
00:10:20,868 --> 00:10:21,933
Yeah, don't!

236
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,434
Uh, maybe we should do this another day.

237
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:26,634
Maybe somewhere public.

238
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:29,601
I am really, really excited to start.

239
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:33,234
All set.

240
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:37,900
You're walking me to the door.

241
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,367
I didn't know you were such a gentleman.

242
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:40,601
I'm an enigma.

243
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,367
You just want to talk to Nathan.

244
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,434
Mystery solved.

245
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:45,900
Did you get my messages?

246
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:47,200
We turned our phones off.

247
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:49,167
Oh, we did, did we?

248
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:50,200
What's up?

249
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:51,734
Haley's in jail.

250
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:54,134
Quinn, watch Jamie.

251
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:08,967
What are you doing here?

252
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:10,567
You've spent enough time at my studio.

253
00:11:10,634 --> 00:11:11,933
I figured I should return the favor.

254
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:15,701
How are lessons going?

255
00:11:15,768 --> 00:11:18,234
There's nothing like it, Mia...

256
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,801
flying through the air.

257
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:21,868
I would stay up there forever
if it wasn't for you...

258
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,334
... and gas.

259
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:27,067
Good to know. I come before gas.

260
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:28,634
Most of the time, you do.

261
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:30,634
Chase, you're up!

262
00:11:30,701 --> 00:11:33,467
Looks like we're gonna head back up.

263
00:11:33,534 --> 00:11:34,501
You want to come?

264
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:36,401
No, thanks.

265
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:38,300
Musicians and small planes don't mix.

266
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,434
Right.

267
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:46,434
Then I'll learn to fly a big plane.

268
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,267
I would have slapped that bitch, too.

269
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:56,000
And your cheating husband.

270
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:57,768
He didn't cheat.

271
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:59,067
Really?

272
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:01,234
He is good-looking, famous...

273
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,868
and is surrounded by girls.

274
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:07,768
My husband's a fat, lazy bum,
and he cheats all the time.

275
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:09,900
It's just what men do.

276
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:11,900
Well, not Nathan.

277
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:14,334
Oh, well, aren't you lucky?

278
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,267
You must have found the only one.

279
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:19,367
Well, if he's so great...

280
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:21,267
then why are you still in here?

281
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,367
Haley James Scott?

282
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:27,267
There he is now.

283
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:51,267
What the hell do you want?

284
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:54,100
I'm dropping the charges.

285
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:56,034
I shouldn't have provoked you last night.

286
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,901
You're not the one that I'm angry with.

287
00:12:57,968 --> 00:13:00,001
Well, that's great.
Thank you.

288
00:13:00,068 --> 00:13:02,100
Let's do each other's hair now.

289
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:04,601
Look, I know that you think
that I'm lying, but I'm not.

290
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:06,867
Nathan is, to the both of us.

291
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:08,267
This is such crap.

292
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:10,467
I know him better than
anybody else in the world,

293
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:12,434
and what you're saying he did isn't him!

294
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:16,367
Maybe not when he's sober.

295
00:13:16,434 --> 00:13:17,801
But he wasn't.

296
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:19,200
Neither of us were.

297
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:28,100
What? What is this?

298
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:30,701
The number of men who might
be the father of your baby?

299
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:33,834
It's my phone number.

300
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:36,500
Look through Nathan's old cellphone bills.

301
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,601
I'm sorry.

302
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,901
I know you're just trying
to protect your family.

303
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:43,233
But so am I.

304
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,034
You hate the sex scenes?
But those are my favorite.

305
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,400
I don't hate the sex scenes.

306
00:13:57,467 --> 00:13:58,901
Well, then, why is red ink
all over the page?

307
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:00,601
Red ink means bad.

308
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,267
Bad, bad.

309
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:04,001
I had a red pen. I'll use blue next time.

310
00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:05,667
And I think the characters should have sex.

311
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:07,934
I just don't think it would
happen the way you wrote it.

312
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:09,634
It did happen the way I wrote it.

313
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:12,801
I mean, it would. It just
doesn't seem realistic to me.

314
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:14,233
The girl rips her clothes off

315
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,233
and throws herself at the guy for no reason?

316
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,200
I just can't see that happening.

317
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:22,100
Huh.

318
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:28,467
You don't need a lot.
Maybe just a line or two.

319
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:32,467
Can you see it happening now?

320
00:14:32,534 --> 00:14:34,734
No! Oh, God. No.

321
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:36,867
No. I can't. Uh...

322
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:39,001
Oh, God. No.

323
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:41,334
What's the matter?
We're working together.

324
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,034
That's not how I work.

325
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,100
This is how all guys work.

326
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,767
Uh...

327
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,467
You know...

328
00:14:51,534 --> 00:14:53,500
I thought you would actually
take this seriously,

329
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:57,133
but I guess that was my mistake.

330
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:05,801
Please tell me you're kidding.

331
00:15:05,867 --> 00:15:09,867
Okay, Alex. Settle down. I'll be right over.

332
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:11,300
Ready for lunch?

333
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:13,334
I'm sorry. That was Alex, and
she's upset about something.

334
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,434
And it's kind of my job to take care of her.

335
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
I'll make it up to you. I promise.

336
00:15:20,534 --> 00:15:23,801
Okay. I pulled some more ... 

337
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:25,867
Mouth, where'd Millie go?

338
00:15:25,934 --> 00:15:28,068
To take care of Alex.

339
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:29,500
Oh, good.

340
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:31,534
Get a shovel and help her
get rid of the body.

341
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:32,934
Is she that bad?

342
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:34,300
Should I be worried about Millie?

343
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,667
Not unless you think Alex
is trying to sleep with her,

344
00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:38,068
so yes.

345
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,867
She stayed out partying all night.

346
00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:43,034
She was probably celebrating,

347
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,133
and I can't say that I blame her.

348
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,701
Check these out.

349
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:49,434
Wow.

350
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,567
These are from last night?
Amazing, right?

351
00:15:52,634 --> 00:15:55,133
Totally not a turd sandwich.

352
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,233
I asked her to do it full time.

353
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,100
Did you ever think
you'd be dating a model?

354
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:08,434
Well, how did you find out

355
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,100
That your husband
was cheating on you?

356
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:11,367
Which time?

357
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:14,867
I always had my suspicions, you know?

358
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:16,267
But I didn't find out for sure

359
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:19,434
until I walked in on him
having sex with my neighbor,

360
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,601
and even then he tried to deny it.

361
00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:25,467
The only thing that men
do more than cheat

362
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:26,968
is lie.

363
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:30,901
Courtney Smith?

364
00:16:30,968 --> 00:16:34,034
Your husband's here to bail you out.

365
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,467
That's me. I'll see you around.

366
00:16:37,534 --> 00:16:39,233
You're going back to him?

367
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,068
What am I gonna do? I love him.

368
00:16:54,968 --> 00:16:57,434
You're not actually
gonna call him, are you?

369
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,133
No matter what, Nathan
will always be my son.

370
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,567
Tell him that.

371
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:09,167
How can you be so soft on the inside...

372
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:12,534
and so hard on the outside?

373
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,801
Not now.

374
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:35,267
You okay? Who is it?

375
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:36,634
It's nobody.

376
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:38,801
What do you want?
Hi, Nathan.

377
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:40,867
I heard about your problem.
I was wondering if I could ... 

378
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,233
If you could what? Help?

379
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,133
You made a fortune
capitalizing on the murder

380
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,467
of your own brother.

381
00:17:45,534 --> 00:17:47,267
You save your help for
people who don't know you

382
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:48,867
and stay away from me and my family.

383
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:53,701
Okay, then.

384
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:56,133
Well, you let me know
if you need anything.

385
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,701
Good talking to you, too.

386
00:17:57,767 --> 00:18:00,133
Please try your call again later.
Okay.

387
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:05,267
You'll never find forgiveness
from your family.

388
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,300
You know, Jame, you're a smart kid,

389
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:26,467
but you're not quite Beethoven.

390
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:31,934
Are you hungry? Can
I make you something?

391
00:18:32,001 --> 00:18:34,467
Will you take me to see my mom?

392
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:37,801
Your dad will be home soon.

393
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:42,901
We wouldn't want to be gone
when she gets home, would we?

394
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:44,901
I guess not.

395
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:50,267
Do you still love uncle David?

396
00:18:51,968 --> 00:18:54,300
Yeah. Why would you ask me that?

397
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,001
Why aren't you with him?

398
00:18:59,634 --> 00:19:01,934
It's a lot of little things.

399
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:03,901
Like what?

400
00:19:03,968 --> 00:19:06,367
I don't know.

401
00:19:06,434 --> 00:19:08,034
It's complicated.

402
00:19:09,534 --> 00:19:11,300
That's not a very good answer.

403
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:15,001
I know.

404
00:19:15,068 --> 00:19:18,767
Actually, I could go for some cereal.

405
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:20,867
Yeah?

406
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,634
Let's go.

407
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:37,934
Renee dropped the charges,
so this should all go away.

408
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:39,867
Well, Renee is not going away.

409
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:41,901
We need to do something about it.

410
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:43,300
I'm on it.

411
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:44,634
Really?

412
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:46,601
'Cause from the looks
of things this morning,

413
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:47,834
you were on something else.

414
00:19:47,901 --> 00:19:50,300
Hey. Are you okay?

415
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:52,367
Yeah. I just want to get out of here.

416
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:54,334
Oh, I wish you would
have just stayed home

417
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,767
and let me take care of this.

418
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:57,034
Why? What's the big deal?

419
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:04,500
Come on.

420
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:07,133
Mr. Scott! Mr. Scott! Mr. Scott!

421
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,100
Hey, bud, how do you like your cereal?

422
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:31,300
Cereal? You just poured milk
over a bowl of cookies.

423
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:33,734
Are you complaining?

424
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:34,801
No.

425
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:38,068
Hold on. I'll be right back.

426
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:47,267
David.

427
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:49,400
I just need to know one thing.

428
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:51,634
Did you go home with that guy last night?

429
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:55,734
Yeah.

430
00:20:55,801 --> 00:20:59,667
So I guess I was wrong.

431
00:20:59,734 --> 00:21:03,167
There was something you could
do to make me give up hope.

432
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:06,001
Uncle David!

433
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:07,068
Are you gonna stay with us?

434
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:08,968
Hey, bud.

435
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,968
I'm sorry. I can't. I just
came by to say hi to you...

436
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,300
and goodbye to your aunt Quinn.

437
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:26,400
Hey, you!
hey.

438
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:27,667
Where you been?

439
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:30,034
I went to visit my pilot
boyfriend this morning.

440
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,233
Hmm. He sounds cool.

441
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,367
Yeah, almost as cool as
my bartender boyfriend.

442
00:21:35,434 --> 00:21:36,801
That's "bar manager."

443
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:37,968
Oh.

444
00:21:38,034 --> 00:21:39,500
Mia, have you heard from Haley today?

445
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,034
She's supposed to be in the studio.

446
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,701
No, not a peep.

447
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:44,667
Well, see if you can find her,

448
00:21:44,734 --> 00:21:47,767
considering you're such
good friends and alike.

449
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:49,467
Hmm.

450
00:21:49,534 --> 00:21:52,367
I really wish you worked at a bar

451
00:21:52,434 --> 00:21:53,901
that wasn't attached to my studio.

452
00:21:55,434 --> 00:21:58,367
I won't be working at any bar
once I get my pilot's license.

453
00:21:58,434 --> 00:22:00,500
I owe that to you.

454
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:02,767
You're the one that inspired me
to follow my dreams.

455
00:22:02,834 --> 00:22:04,367
How did I do that?

456
00:22:04,434 --> 00:22:05,701
By following yours.

457
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:07,267
And I never would have met you

458
00:22:07,334 --> 00:22:09,934
if the bar that I work at wasn't
attached to your studio.

459
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:15,901
I really hope you make a better
pilot than you do a bartender.

460
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,901
That's "manager."

461
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,601
We need to go on the offensive

462
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:27,400
before this thing gets any bigger.

463
00:22:27,467 --> 00:22:29,167
I'm gonna schedule a
press conference today

464
00:22:29,233 --> 00:22:30,667
so you can make an official statement.

465
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:32,100
And what good will that do?

466
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:34,100
It'll give people a chance
to see who you really are... 

467
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:35,901
an honest family man
with his wife by his side.

468
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:37,467
You want me there?

469
00:22:37,534 --> 00:22:39,601
Definitely...  I think it's
really important that we show

470
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:41,200
that you support Nathan through all this.

471
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:43,367
And you really think making
a statement is gonna help?

472
00:22:43,434 --> 00:22:45,734
Yeah, look, how much, I don't know,

473
00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:47,100
but it'll definitely help.

474
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:48,267
Mom!

475
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:58,834
Set up the press conference.

476
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:07,467
Hi. How's the story coming?

477
00:23:07,534 --> 00:23:09,400
It better not have a happy ending.

478
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:11,867
Nope. no worries there. it's over.

479
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:13,068
What happened?

480
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:14,734
Let's just say...

481
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:16,634
she's the person you thought she was.

482
00:23:16,701 --> 00:23:18,934
Does Brooke Davis have to slap a bitch?

483
00:23:19,001 --> 00:23:20,400
No, baby.

484
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:23,034
I just won't be working with
her anymore. She's all yours.

485
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,267
I'm sorry, babe.

486
00:23:25,334 --> 00:23:26,867
Are you okay?

487
00:23:26,934 --> 00:23:29,968
Yeah, it's just I hadn't found
a script I liked that much

488
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:32,167
in a long time.

489
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:33,701
I can't believe I was stupid enough

490
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:35,233
to think she'd take it seriously.

491
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,801
Well, you'll find a better script.

492
00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:40,767
Yeah?

493
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:43,467
I guess it's back to renting
movies instead of making them.

494
00:23:43,534 --> 00:23:44,801
Any suggestions?

495
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:50,233
Something that'll put you in a better mood,

496
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,100
or at least in the mood
to make out with me.

497
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:55,434
"Grease 2" it is.

498
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,534
Again?

499
00:23:57,601 --> 00:23:59,701
You're weird.

500
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:08,500
Hey, you.

501
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:12,400
You got any good stories from the inside?

502
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:18,167
Actually, um... Renee came by.

503
00:24:19,534 --> 00:24:21,233
What did she want?

504
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,834
Just to tell me that
she's dropping the charges,

505
00:24:23,901 --> 00:24:27,701
and, uh, she's still insisting
that you're the father.

506
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,167
She's crazy.

507
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:31,334
Yeah, I know. That's what I told her.

508
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,367
She's just so certain.

509
00:24:33,434 --> 00:24:35,267
You don't remember meeting her at all or...?

510
00:24:35,334 --> 00:24:37,100
No.

511
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:40,367
Were you drinking a lot that night?

512
00:24:40,434 --> 00:24:42,567
You're actually starting
to believe her, aren't you?

513
00:24:42,634 --> 00:24:44,267
I'm not. Of course not.

514
00:24:44,334 --> 00:24:46,467
I just don't understand why she
would make something like this up.

515
00:24:46,534 --> 00:24:47,801
I mean, if it's all a lie,

516
00:24:47,867 --> 00:24:49,467
we're gonna find out when
the baby comes out anyway.

517
00:24:49,534 --> 00:24:52,300
So why would she do that?

518
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:54,167
She's trying to take advantage of us, Haley.

519
00:24:54,233 --> 00:24:56,001
Why you?

520
00:24:57,767 --> 00:24:59,200
Great.

521
00:24:59,267 --> 00:25:02,068
You're the one person I need to believe me,

522
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,567
and you think I'm lying.

523
00:25:03,634 --> 00:25:04,867
I didn't say that.

524
00:25:04,934 --> 00:25:07,133
You didn't have to.

525
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,334
Nathan.

526
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,200
Where are you going?

527
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:15,034
Out. And don't worry...  I'll
try not to knock anyone up.

528
00:25:27,001 --> 00:25:28,268
There's been a mistake.

529
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,801
I ordered my meal alfresco,

530
00:25:30,867 --> 00:25:33,767
but I don't want to eat it outside!

531
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:35,101
And I'm still missing my... 

532
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:40,567
You're not a cheesecake.

533
00:25:40,634 --> 00:25:43,600
What do you do? Do you shake
hands by spreading your legs?

534
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,234
A guy was finally interested

535
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,134
in your writing instead of your body,

536
00:25:47,201 --> 00:25:49,700
and you did what you do best...  you blew it.

537
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:51,333
Brooke, I'm sorry.

538
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,934
I made a mistake.

539
00:25:54,001 --> 00:25:55,934
He was giving you a chance to
show the world that you are more

540
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:58,534
than just another stupid,
washed-up actress,

541
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,734
but you proved that that's
exactly what you are.

542
00:26:00,801 --> 00:26:02,134
Nice work.

543
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,634
Oh, no. I'll be taking this.

544
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,667
We at least need your body in shape

545
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,467
since it's all you've got going for you.

546
00:26:20,901 --> 00:26:23,001
Why didn't you tell me
they took you off the air?

547
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:24,467
When did I have a chance... 

548
00:26:24,534 --> 00:26:26,268
last night when you were with Alex

549
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:28,801
or this afternoon when
you ran off to be with Alex?

550
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:30,534
I'm sorry, Marvin.

551
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,134
I'm here now. Do you want to talk about it?

552
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:36,300
Not really.

553
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:38,234
I, uh, saw your photos from last night.

554
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,967
You looked beautiful.

555
00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:42,934
Brooke thinks you should be a model.

556
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,300
What do you think?

557
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:48,567
I think you've worked for five
years to get where you are.

558
00:26:48,634 --> 00:26:50,767
But it's something new and different.

559
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:54,067
I didn't know you wanted new and different.

560
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:56,801
Neither did I.

561
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:58,934
But it's just you always
said that, you know,

562
00:26:59,001 --> 00:27:01,268
dealing with models was
the worst part of your job.

563
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,168
But that doesn't mean I'd be like them.

564
00:27:03,234 --> 00:27:05,934
You mean like partying all night
and showing up late for work?

565
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,934
How does that make you any different?

566
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:11,934
I see you've given this a lot of thought.

567
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:14,567
I just don't think it's who you are.

568
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:15,967
And did you decide that

569
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:19,700
all by yourself down
here in the basement?

570
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,168
Your boyfriend works in a sewer?

571
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,367
What? I said, "basement."

572
00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:36,734
And that wasn't even
the point of my story!

573
00:27:36,801 --> 00:27:38,001
Whatever. Let's do this.

574
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:39,934
And make sure you tell me
when we're buzzed.

575
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:40,967
I love that part.

576
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,500
Mm.mm.

577
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:48,101
Brooke wants me to be a model.

578
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:50,034
Right, which would be awesome.

579
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,667
And Marvin wasn't excited.

580
00:27:52,734 --> 00:27:54,268
First of all...

581
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:57,367
his name is Marvin.

582
00:27:57,433 --> 00:27:59,300
And second of all, he works in a sewer.

583
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:02,268
Ugh! I mean, who cares what he thinks?

584
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:04,767
I am tired of people thinking things.

585
00:28:06,234 --> 00:28:07,567
What do you think?

586
00:28:07,634 --> 00:28:09,967
I don't know. It might be fun.

587
00:28:10,034 --> 00:28:11,467
Then do it.

588
00:28:11,534 --> 00:28:12,767
What if I don't like it?

589
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:15,567
Then quit. I mean, that's what I'd do.

590
00:28:15,634 --> 00:28:17,700
But don't ask me. I'm stupid.

591
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:19,268
Just ask Brooke.

592
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:23,433
I'm sure she doesn't think that.

593
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,634
Mm. she does.

594
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,367
She came over earlier,
told me I was stupid,

595
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:27,867
and then stole my cheesecake,

596
00:28:27,934 --> 00:28:30,600
but the joke's on her because
I just ordered another one.

597
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,901
Look who's stupid now, Brooke.

598
00:28:32,967 --> 00:28:34,934
I doubt she meant it.

599
00:28:35,001 --> 00:28:36,734
And I don't really care what Brooke thinks.

600
00:28:36,801 --> 00:28:38,234
I care about Julian.

601
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,634
He was the one who believed in my script.

602
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:45,600
Okay. We're buzzed.

603
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:47,001
I love it!

604
00:28:47,067 --> 00:28:48,400
You know, I could really use a lime.

605
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:51,034
And I want the tequila, so we're even.

606
00:28:51,101 --> 00:28:53,634
So, show Julian you aren't stupid.

607
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,134
Make him see you in a new light,

608
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:59,034
like the way you made
people see me as a model.

609
00:28:59,101 --> 00:29:01,001
You are a model, bitch.

610
00:29:01,067 --> 00:29:03,433
And you're not stupid, bitch.
Now go show Julian that.

611
00:29:04,734 --> 00:29:07,268
Thanks. Will you help me
pick out a nerdy outfit?

612
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,901
Just pretend I'm you.

613
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:26,634
Uh-oh.

614
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,901
Haley's at the piano.

615
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:32,001
I'm a musician, Quinn.

616
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:34,134
Spill it.

617
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:37,433
Did David ever lie to you

618
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,700
about something, like, really important?

619
00:29:41,767 --> 00:29:44,433
Lying was never really David's style.

620
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,934
He's like Nathan in that way.

621
00:29:47,001 --> 00:29:48,234
Why?

622
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,500
It's just this... 

623
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:54,634
It just scares me is all.

624
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,400
If you and David can split up

625
00:29:56,467 --> 00:29:58,500
and you loved each other so much,

626
00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:00,901
how are Nathan and I
ever gonna make it?

627
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:06,801
Because you're not us, Hales.

628
00:30:06,867 --> 00:30:08,767
I mean, I see the way you two act.

629
00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:12,667
You're like best friends who are in love.

630
00:30:12,734 --> 00:30:13,901
You know, you and Nathan

631
00:30:13,967 --> 00:30:15,467
still do the little things for each other,

632
00:30:15,534 --> 00:30:19,734
and David and I stopped doing
those things a long time ago.

633
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:22,001
You know, we stopped
being kind to each other.

634
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:24,767
And we stopped being
captivated by each other.

635
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:27,400
And when we stopped doing the little things,

636
00:30:27,467 --> 00:30:29,433
we stopped doing the big things, too,

637
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,734
you know, like saying, "I love you."

638
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:34,567
But David is saying that now.

639
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:36,734
Doesn't that count for anything?

640
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:40,500
It does.

641
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:43,901
And, in a way, I'm...  I'm
always gonna love David.

642
00:30:45,801 --> 00:30:48,867
But it's been over for a long time,

643
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:51,500
and I think he's now realizing that.

644
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:57,867
You and Nathan are gonna be just fine.

645
00:30:57,934 --> 00:31:00,134
Yeah. I hope so.

646
00:31:00,201 --> 00:31:02,268
I just hate that it has to be so hard.

647
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:03,467
I know.

648
00:31:03,534 --> 00:31:05,500
But we can handle it.

649
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:07,168
We're James girls.

650
00:31:07,234 --> 00:31:09,433
Mm.

651
00:31:11,134 --> 00:31:13,867
Bring it in.

652
00:31:13,934 --> 00:31:16,333
I love you.

653
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:23,834
Is this the support group
for husbands of James girls?

654
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:25,867
I'll have a double of whatever he's having.

655
00:31:25,934 --> 00:31:28,500
A double water.

656
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:30,268
You know, we do have
drinks here, guys.

657
00:31:32,634 --> 00:31:34,734
Water it is.

658
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,634
That's probably a smart move.

659
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,801
I wouldn't know.

660
00:31:40,867 --> 00:31:42,433
I haven't made a smart move in years.

661
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,901
Haley got arrested this morning.

662
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:53,067
She hit a girl last night
who claims I got her pregnant.

663
00:31:53,134 --> 00:31:54,201
Did you?

664
00:31:54,268 --> 00:31:55,901
No.

665
00:31:55,967 --> 00:31:57,534
But it doesn't seem to matter.

666
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,567
I think Haley's starting to doubt me,

667
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:01,400
and to be honest, I don't blame her.

668
00:32:01,467 --> 00:32:03,433
At this point...

669
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,801
I'd doubt me, too, if I was her.

670
00:32:10,134 --> 00:32:12,300
Did Quinn come home last night?

671
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,101
So, that's it, right?

672
00:32:24,168 --> 00:32:25,700
It's over.

673
00:32:28,034 --> 00:32:31,134
You know, when Haley
went on tour, we split up.

674
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:33,467
I thought it was over.

675
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,867
No matter what I tried,
I could not get her back.

676
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,901
So, as much as it killed me, I let her go.

677
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,567
But I never gave up hope.

678
00:32:45,634 --> 00:32:49,134
Did Haley sleep with someone?

679
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:52,001
Well, there was a guy.

680
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:53,801
Did she sleep with him?

681
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,367
No.

682
00:33:03,001 --> 00:33:04,534
Yeah.

683
00:33:11,134 --> 00:33:12,934
I changed the sex scene.

684
00:33:13,001 --> 00:33:15,067
Now the girl makes an ass of herself

685
00:33:15,134 --> 00:33:16,967
and the guy leaves.

686
00:33:19,034 --> 00:33:21,333
That's more realistic.

687
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,500
I...I know you're upset with
me, but that's just what I do.

688
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:27,367
I am the girl who takes off her clothes

689
00:33:27,433 --> 00:33:29,168
and sleeps with guys.

690
00:33:29,234 --> 00:33:32,268
Yeah. well, I'm not one of those guys.

691
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:33,433
I know.

692
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,801
You're the first guy to ever notice me

693
00:33:34,867 --> 00:33:36,168
for something other than

694
00:33:36,234 --> 00:33:38,134
getting photographed
with no underwear

695
00:33:38,201 --> 00:33:40,367
or videotaping threesomes.

696
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:43,367
We've all been there.

697
00:33:43,433 --> 00:33:45,367
I just want you to know how sorry I am.

698
00:33:45,433 --> 00:33:47,333
You gave me the chance to prove to you

699
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,134
I wasn't just some washed-up actress

700
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:51,667
and, instead, I showed you that I was.

701
00:33:51,734 --> 00:33:53,767
You showed me a lot more than that, Alex.

702
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:58,067
Look, I just think we don't
work very well together.

703
00:33:58,134 --> 00:34:00,433
We have very different styles.

704
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,734
Okay, but if you would just
give me one more chance,

705
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:06,168
I promise I wouldn't let you down.

706
00:34:06,234 --> 00:34:09,333
If not, thanks for a really great day,

707
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
until I screwed it up.

708
00:34:23,301 --> 00:34:25,567
Hey. You look good. I came
up with a list of questions

709
00:34:25,633 --> 00:34:26,900
they're probably gonna ask.

710
00:34:26,967 --> 00:34:28,001
You and Haley should be ready.

711
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,867
Haley's not coming.

712
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,533
Nate, that is not a good idea, man.

713
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,867
You going out there by yourself
will not look good.

714
00:34:33,934 --> 00:34:35,834
You know what else doesn't look good?

715
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,734
You and Quinn.

716
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,700
What's that supposed to mean?

717
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:42,234
It means I need your head in the game

718
00:34:42,301 --> 00:34:43,700
and not up Quinn's skirt.

719
00:34:43,767 --> 00:34:45,900
What part of sleeping with her
did you think was a good idea?

720
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:49,267
She's married, Clay, to a guy I really like.

721
00:34:49,334 --> 00:34:51,468
Nothing happened last night, Nate.

722
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:53,134
Right, so you... what?

723
00:34:53,201 --> 00:34:55,500
You took her back to your
place so you guys could talk?

724
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:57,201
As a matter of fact, yes.

725
00:34:57,267 --> 00:34:59,633
I was actually helping her out.

726
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,301
I would have thought you of all people

727
00:35:01,368 --> 00:35:03,134
would understand about
jumping to conclusions.

728
00:35:05,267 --> 00:35:08,167
Whatever. I'm ...  I'm sorry.
you need to be focused.

729
00:35:08,234 --> 00:35:10,301
Let's, uh... let's just do this, okay?

730
00:35:10,368 --> 00:35:11,734
Clay...

731
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,934
if I could distance myself
from this woman, I would,

732
00:35:15,001 --> 00:35:16,301
but I can't.

733
00:35:16,368 --> 00:35:17,800
Now, you can.

734
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:20,334
Quinn is Haley's sister. She
has a lot going on right now.

735
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:23,334
Stay away from her, okay?

736
00:35:24,867 --> 00:35:27,001
Whatever you say.

737
00:35:29,134 --> 00:35:30,867
Hey.

738
00:35:30,934 --> 00:35:32,967
What are you ... what are you doing here?

739
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:35,834
We face things together, remember?

740
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:40,234
Thank you.

741
00:35:40,301 --> 00:35:42,567
I didn't know if I could do
this without you.

742
00:35:42,633 --> 00:35:46,533
You don't ever have to worry about that.

743
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:10,467
Thank you for coming.

744
00:36:10,534 --> 00:36:13,367
I'm here to set the record straight.

745
00:36:13,434 --> 00:36:14,800
First of all,

746
00:36:14,867 --> 00:36:17,800
I just want to say that
I love my wife and my son.

747
00:36:21,933 --> 00:36:26,100
You want to tell me what
this was doing in the trash?

748
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:30,701
I don't like the po-po.

749
00:36:32,467 --> 00:36:35,401
Sweetie, they were just doing their job.

750
00:36:35,467 --> 00:36:37,334
Mommy made a mistake,

751
00:36:37,401 --> 00:36:39,134
and they needed to talk to me about it.

752
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,601
Just keep the toy, baby.

753
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:44,000
Are you and dad gonna leave each other

754
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:46,267
like aunt Quinn and uncle David?

755
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:50,734
Hey. Come here.

756
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,401
Of course not.

757
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:55,334
Your daddy and I love
each other very much.

758
00:36:55,401 --> 00:36:58,334
But aunt Quinn and uncle David
loved each other, too,

759
00:36:58,401 --> 00:36:59,634
then they stopped.

760
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,534
Listen.

761
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:08,434
What your dad and I have is very special,

762
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:11,967
and I promise you we are not
gonna stop loving each other.

763
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:15,867
Don't forget that.

764
00:37:20,668 --> 00:37:22,900
Good night.

765
00:37:22,967 --> 00:37:24,567
Can you stay a little bit longer?

766
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,401
Sure, sweetie.

767
00:37:37,534 --> 00:37:38,900
I would never do anything

768
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:41,034
to hurt the people that I care about.

769
00:37:44,534 --> 00:37:47,000
Are you sure we won't
get in trouble for this?

770
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:50,768
Relax. I do this all the time.

771
00:37:50,867 --> 00:37:53,701
You know, I thought i'd be
afraid of flying with you,

772
00:37:53,768 --> 00:37:55,701
but I'm actually kind of turned on.

773
00:37:55,768 --> 00:38:00,334
You got 30 seconds to join
the mile-high club, captain?

774
00:38:00,334 --> 00:38:02,367
Flying isn't the only thing
i've been practicing.

775
00:38:02,434 --> 00:38:03,734
I'm up to a couple minutes now.

776
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,768
Oh, yeah?

777
00:38:17,734 --> 00:38:22,067
I know some of you are looking
at me in a different light,

778
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:25,434
but I urge you to see me for who I am.

779
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:28,567
I'll do it. I'll model for you.

780
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:40,034
I've always prided myself
on being an honest man

781
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,000
and taking responsibility for my actions.

782
00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:44,167
All right, Bobcat fans, coming up,

783
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:46,134
local sports star Nathan Scott

784
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,534
speaks out regarding recent
allegations against him.

785
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:52,467
You know, it must be hard to log
tapes from here, huh, Marvin?

786
00:38:52,534 --> 00:38:53,967
... And as well as some early NFL news

787
00:38:54,034 --> 00:38:57,034
for you fantasy-football junkies.

788
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:05,668
I'm someone that you can depend on.

789
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:08,034
And I'm someone that can be trusted.

790
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:12,067
Honey, I'm home. Let's do this.

791
00:39:12,134 --> 00:39:14,301
I told you it was realistic.

792
00:39:15,234 --> 00:39:17,301
Um, hey, honey.

793
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,701
Alex and I worked everything out.

794
00:39:22,933 --> 00:39:24,501
Isn't that great?

795
00:39:28,334 --> 00:39:30,768
I want everyone to know the truth,

796
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:33,434
and the truth is that I was
never with that woman.

797
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:37,367
Hey, man.

798
00:39:37,434 --> 00:39:40,134
Hey, do you know where Quinn is?

799
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,967
No. sorry. I haven't seen her.

800
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,034
Thanks for letting me stay here.

801
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,634
I know it puts you in a bad position.

802
00:39:50,701 --> 00:39:53,900
There's just a lot of drama
at Nathan and Haley's.

803
00:39:53,967 --> 00:39:57,000
It's fine. You can stay here
as long as you want.

804
00:39:59,734 --> 00:40:01,401
So, what would people say if they knew

805
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:04,434
that you had a girl over you
weren't actually sleeping with?

806
00:40:07,134 --> 00:40:09,933
Nobody would believe it.

807
00:40:18,634 --> 00:40:20,867
I just want to say that
I believe my husband

808
00:40:20,933 --> 00:40:23,534
and I stand by him 100%.

809
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,668
You've reached Renee. Leave a message.

810
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,167
I'll do whatever it takes

811
00:41:12,234 --> 00:41:14,833
to prove that these allegations are false.

812
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,567
Hopefully now this can all go away

813
00:41:17,634 --> 00:41:20,401
and my family can be left alone.

814
00:41:20,467 --> 00:41:22,867
Thank you.

815
00:41:22,933 --> 00:41:26,167
I trust you had a nice flight.

816
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,601
I have a proposition for you.
