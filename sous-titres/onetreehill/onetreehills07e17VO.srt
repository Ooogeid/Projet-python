1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,835
Alex has to be better, or we're
gonna be in serious trouble here.

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,095
She will be.

3
00:00:04,178 --> 00:00:07,035
I'm letting everyone down, and
I don't get drunk when I'm sad.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,300
I sleep with boys.
You want to get out of here?

5
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:10,878
My name is millicent.

6
00:00:11,003 --> 00:00:13,447
I keep telling everybody I'm fine,

7
00:00:13,572 --> 00:00:15,049
And I'm not fine.

8
00:00:15,132 --> 00:00:16,477
So, let me get this straight.

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,780
You don't want to make a record
because it's too personal?

10
00:00:18,863 --> 00:00:19,869
That's right.

11
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:22,088
- Personal sells albums.
- So, make a record with me.

12
00:00:22,213 --> 00:00:24,576
I loved you so much, sara.

13
00:00:24,701 --> 00:00:28,337
You were perfect with me...
And you always will be.

14
00:00:30,032 --> 00:00:32,073
- Are you okay, mom?
- I have cancer.

15
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,849
Oh, no, no, no. It's pancreatic.

16
00:00:34,974 --> 00:00:36,545
So I've accepted it.

17
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,827
You're giving up.

18
00:00:37,952 --> 00:00:39,491
No, I am not giving up.

19
00:00:39,616 --> 00:00:42,509
Maybe quinn can take a picture of it.
We can just add it to this stupid box.

20
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:44,994
Taylor. Tay.

22
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:20,570
I, uh, know that we haven't had
a family breakfast in a long time,

23
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:22,130
But, um, I seem to remember

24
00:01:22,255 --> 00:01:24,811
That there used to be
at least some talking

25
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:26,487
And, uh, you know, eating

26
00:01:26,612 --> 00:01:28,497
The last few times we've done this.

27
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,216
I don't know. Call me crazy.

28
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,072
I'm sorry, mom.
It's just hard for us to...

29
00:01:32,155 --> 00:01:34,391
I know, honey, but...

30
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:36,162
I just want to enjoy a breakfast

31
00:01:36,287 --> 00:01:38,071
With my favorite
people in the world.

32
00:01:39,158 --> 00:01:40,160
Okay?

33
00:01:42,003 --> 00:01:43,009
Okay.

34
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:44,603
Good.

35
00:01:45,024 --> 00:01:47,041
There he is.

36
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:50,322
Finally, someone with a personality.

37
00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:53,400
So, what's for breakfast?

38
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:55,575
For you, a little bit of everything.

39
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,336
Ooh, my favorite.

40
00:02:01,384 --> 00:02:03,290
What's everyone staring at?

41
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:08,620
I think it's because that
was the last piece of bacon.

42
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:12,130
But don't you worry about it.
They had their chance.

43
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:15,373
Come with me. I want to
show you something, okay?

44
00:02:15,498 --> 00:02:17,883
I would like to thank all of you

45
00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:21,194
For this scintillating
breakfast conversation.

46
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,100
You know, it's moments like these

47
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:25,699
That we're supposed to remember.

48
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:39,246
Hey, come back to bed.

49
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:41,185
Why are you still here?

50
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,291
Ouch. Well,
someone's a little feisty.

51
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,129
I like it.

52
00:02:45,254 --> 00:02:47,913
You know, to be honest, we could've
used a little more of that last night.

53
00:02:47,996 --> 00:02:49,509
What's that supposed to mean?

54
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:51,581
Well, you got to admit,
I did most of the work.

55
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:53,418
It's okay, though.

56
00:02:53,543 --> 00:02:55,390
I mean, I slept like a baby.

57
00:02:55,515 --> 00:02:58,064
<i>Good for you. You know who didn't
sleep like a baby? Me.</i>

58
00:02:58,189 --> 00:02:59,903
I got exactly 26 minutes of sleep,

59
00:03:00,028 --> 00:03:01,741
And I'm filming eight scenes today.

60
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:04,446
Well, I refuse to apologize
for my exceptional stamina.

61
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:07,755
<i>I'm not talking about that!
I'm talking about that!</i>

62
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,224
The horrible noise.

63
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:11,196
I think it's called music.

64
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:14,203
No, when it comes through
a hotel-room wall,

65
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:16,408
It's called noise.

66
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:18,782
So, you're not coming back to bed?

67
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,522
Let me try to explain this to you.

68
00:03:21,647 --> 00:03:23,124
I'm filming a movie right now,

69
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:25,029
So I need this thing called sleep.

70
00:03:25,154 --> 00:03:27,869
And when I don't get sleep,
I get bags under my eyes.

71
00:03:27,994 --> 00:03:31,109
And those bags are gonna be
documented on film forever. Yeah.

72
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:32,613
Got it? Got it.

73
00:03:32,738 --> 00:03:34,585
Hey, well, look on the bright side.

74
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,224
I mean, odds are no one's
even gonna see this film.

75
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:40,622
Seriously, why are you still here?

76
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:47,581
Have I been replaced already?

77
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:49,150
What?

78
00:03:49,275 --> 00:03:50,920
You're sitting in my chair.

79
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,494
I'm sorry. I thought you...

80
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:57,424
No, no. Just a poorly timed joke.

81
00:03:58,929 --> 00:04:00,307
You're here early.

82
00:04:00,432 --> 00:04:02,111
Oh, I know. I couldn't sleep.

83
00:04:02,236 --> 00:04:03,748
So... Figured I'd come in

84
00:04:03,873 --> 00:04:05,452
And try to steal your job.

85
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:09,158
Can I ask you something

86
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:11,429
I'm not really allowed
to ask anyone else?

87
00:04:11,554 --> 00:04:13,533
Of course.

88
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:15,638
Am I doing okay?

89
00:04:15,763 --> 00:04:17,906
Are you kidding?

90
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:19,940
You're doing great.

91
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:23,065
Everyone is so proud of you,
especially your dad and...

92
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:26,807
...And me.

93
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,011
I do have one major complaint,
though.

94
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,078
You need to start dressing warmer.

95
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:34,480
'cause if you don't,
you're gonna get sick,

96
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:36,815
And then you'll get all
sluggish like you do,

97
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,083
And then you'll grouch and
you'll whine a little,

98
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,418
And nobody wants that.

99
00:04:40,543 --> 00:04:41,551
I don't grouch.

100
00:04:41,676 --> 00:04:43,353
Yes, you do. And whine.

101
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:44,854
I do whine.

102
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:46,255
A little.

103
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,614
Yeah.

104
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:54,830
Okay, well, you probably have
a million fires to put out,

105
00:04:54,955 --> 00:04:57,299
So I'm gonna get out of your way.

106
00:04:57,424 --> 00:05:00,067
Thanks for letting
me sit in your chair.

107
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:01,859
Anytime.

108
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,252
- You okay?
- No, I'm not.

109
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:26,024
She's acting like
there's nothing wrong,

110
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:27,525
Like she's fine.

111
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,993
She's just trying to be
strong for everyone, haley.

112
00:05:30,118 --> 00:05:32,062
By giving up?

113
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:34,664
No. By accepting the
situation that she's in.

114
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:36,999
<i>She seems at peace with it. Well, I'm
not.</i>

115
00:05:37,124 --> 00:05:39,876
It's not over. She's still here.
I'm not ready to let her stop fighting.

116
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,036
Haley, I know this is hard,
but this is her life,

117
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:44,672
And the doctors told her she
doesn't have much time left.

118
00:05:44,797 --> 00:05:47,667
So, let's get a second
opinion or third or fourth.

119
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,598
And what happens if
they say the same thing?

120
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,511
<i>What if they don't? Haley.</i>

121
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:55,447
What? I -- I have to believe
in something right now,

122
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:58,683
Because without hope,
I wouldn't be able to breathe.

123
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:00,918
So, just let me have that, okay?

124
00:06:01,043 --> 00:06:03,754
If we can't find
someone to help her,

125
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:06,589
Then at least I'll know we
did everything we could.

126
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:10,259
But until we know for sure,
I just... I-I need that hope.

127
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:12,218
Okay. Okay.

128
00:06:17,556 --> 00:06:19,765
Just a few months ago,

129
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,334
I had everything I ever wanted.

130
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:26,971
But now all that seems
like forever ago,

131
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:29,139
Because, one day, I lost my way,

132
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,275
And I forgot who I was.

133
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,468
But I'm trying to find my way back.

134
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,938
I just hope I can get there someday.

135
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:43,675
Thanks.

136
00:06:55,386 --> 00:06:59,165
Do you recognize this handsome guy?

137
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,667
That's you christmas morning.

138
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:03,733
Look how little you were.

139
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:06,268
Yeah. I was a kid back then. Mm-hmm.

140
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:08,052
Look, that's when I got fletcher.

141
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,771
He was my favorite stuffed animal.

142
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,672
Do you still have fletcher?

143
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:12,840
Somewhere.

144
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,908
Chester chewed his head off once.

145
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:16,376
Mom sewed it back on.

146
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:18,778
And he kind of looks weird now.

147
00:07:18,903 --> 00:07:23,282
This was my favorite christmas.

148
00:07:23,407 --> 00:07:25,617
I will never forget it.

149
00:07:25,742 --> 00:07:27,786
Because you got lots
of good presents?

150
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:30,321
Well, you could say that.

151
00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:32,556
I was surrounded by family,

152
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:35,191
By all the people that I
love most in the world.

153
00:07:35,316 --> 00:07:38,893
And that's the best gift
anyone could ever give me.

154
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:44,143
And I got to spend one last
christmas with your grandpa.

155
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,001
That was a good day.

156
00:07:47,126 --> 00:07:49,337
He got you fletcher.

157
00:07:49,462 --> 00:07:53,897
I don't really remember him.

158
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:59,378
Yeah, well, you were
pretty small when he died.

159
00:07:59,503 --> 00:08:01,513
But, boy...

160
00:08:01,638 --> 00:08:05,483
He loved you so much.

161
00:08:05,608 --> 00:08:07,484
Do you miss him?

162
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:10,120
Every second of every day.

163
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:12,922
But you know what I
do to remember him?

164
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:17,359
When I listen to your mom,
I can hear his laugh.

165
00:08:17,484 --> 00:08:20,762
And when I look at your aunt quinn,

166
00:08:20,887 --> 00:08:23,064
I see his eyes.

167
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:25,833
And then I look at you,

168
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:30,094
And I see his beautiful smile.

169
00:08:31,996 --> 00:08:34,297
There it is.

170
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,945
Maybe christmas this
year will be even better.

171
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,404
I hope so.

172
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,083
But, um...

173
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:50,253
I'm not gonna be with you
this christmas, jamie.

174
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:52,655
Where will you be?

175
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:57,183
I'm...
Going to be with your grandpa.

176
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:08,816
Recorded a bunch of songs,
lost the girl,

177
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:11,017
And now you're afraid
to make another record.

178
00:09:11,142 --> 00:09:12,218
Is that accurate?

179
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,786
Yep, those are pretty much

180
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:16,154
The bullet points of
my painful existence.

181
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,722
And thank you, by the way,

182
00:09:17,847 --> 00:09:21,187
For reminding me with such
a cold and brief synopsis.

183
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,260
- Can I give you some advice?
- If I say no...

184
00:09:23,385 --> 00:09:24,461
Get over it.

185
00:09:24,586 --> 00:09:26,462
The girl,
the big bad record executives

186
00:09:26,587 --> 00:09:29,865
Who hurt your feelings...
just get over it.

187
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,134
I wish it were that simple.

188
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:34,205
So, you're telling
me there is no chance

189
00:09:34,288 --> 00:09:36,200
I'm gonna get you to
make a record with us?

190
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:39,039
- I don't think so.
- Not even 1%?

191
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:41,441
<i>Well, there's a 1% chance I'd
do anything with you.</i>

192
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:44,577
Excellent. That's all I need.

193
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:50,073
Ahh. Let's negotiate.

194
00:09:51,608 --> 00:09:53,752
You wrote the script, remember?

195
00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:56,902
If it's putting you to sleep, you have
no one to blame but yourself.

196
00:09:57,113 --> 00:09:58,689
I'm sorry. I was up all night.

197
00:09:58,814 --> 00:09:59,924
Who was he?

198
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:02,982
It wasn't a he.
It was a bunch of hes.

199
00:10:04,553 --> 00:10:06,339
Did your mind really just go there?

200
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:08,682
- No.
- Yeah, right.

201
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:12,229
There's a convetion it town
for patio furniture sales men.

202
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:14,114
Yes, appearntly there are those.

203
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,262
And lucky me,
the suite right next to mine

204
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:18,276
Is party central for
200 middle-aged men

205
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:19,976
Who get to be single for a few days.

206
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:22,574
They haven't stopped
raging since they got here.

207
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:24,135
Okay, so just switch rooms.

208
00:10:24,218 --> 00:10:26,672
I've tried. The stupid
hotel is completely booked.

209
00:10:26,797 --> 00:10:29,105
I hate patio furniture.

210
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,371
Me too. It always gets so dirty.

211
00:10:31,804 --> 00:10:33,844
Alex, we have a big day today.

212
00:10:33,927 --> 00:10:37,034
I know. I'll be fine.
I wrote the script, remember?

213
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,159
Good.

214
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:49,035
So, I, uh... I just spoke
with our team doctor.

215
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,001
Are you okay? Yeah.

216
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:54,566
Actually, um, I talked
to him about your mom,

217
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:56,165
And as it turns out,

218
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,318
He knows one of the best
oncologists in the world,

219
00:10:58,401 --> 00:11:00,431
And he's offered to take
a look at lydia's case.

220
00:11:01,206 --> 00:11:02,277
That's great.

221
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,706
I just want to make sure
that you don't get your hopes up...

222
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,138
You don't have to say it.

223
00:11:06,221 --> 00:11:08,929
Just... Thank you.

224
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,794
You're welcome.

225
00:11:20,518 --> 00:11:23,291
So, here it is.

226
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,014
Kind of great, huh?

227
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:28,691
It's perfect.

228
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:31,456
A little empty.

229
00:11:31,581 --> 00:11:34,589
I'm sorry. That was a stupid joke.

230
00:11:34,714 --> 00:11:37,924
I just wish everything wasn't
so hard with my mom right now.

231
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:41,023
You know I'm the poster
boy for suffering alone.

232
00:11:41,148 --> 00:11:43,089
<i>But you don't have to.</i>

233
00:11:43,214 --> 00:11:44,888
You know, I'm here.

234
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:47,387
I know. Thanks.

235
00:11:47,512 --> 00:11:48,820
I'm not avoiding it.

236
00:11:48,945 --> 00:11:51,476
I'm just trying to figure
it all out, you know?

237
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:54,985
You know, for what it's worth,

238
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,785
You have an opportunity.

239
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,619
You know, you still have
the chance to say goodbye.

240
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:03,485
I didn't have that with sara,
and I wish I did.

241
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,785
You know,
I wish I had that one moment.

242
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,008
Thanks.

243
00:12:08,275 --> 00:12:10,649
So, when do you leave for
your tennis tournament?

244
00:12:10,774 --> 00:12:12,049
I decided not to go.

245
00:12:12,174 --> 00:12:14,249
I want to stay here with you.

246
00:12:15,022 --> 00:12:17,548
I love that, but we both know you're
building something here, okay?

247
00:12:17,673 --> 00:12:19,681
You have a business,
and you have a client list.

248
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,947
It's important, and you have to go.

249
00:12:22,072 --> 00:12:23,479
Stop. It's not an option.

250
00:12:23,604 --> 00:12:24,746
Come on.

251
00:12:24,871 --> 00:12:26,378
I promise, if anything happens,

252
00:12:26,503 --> 00:12:28,244
You'll be my first call.

253
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:29,377
Go.

254
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:32,084
I'll be fine.

255
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:35,798
Okay. First call.

256
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,214
First call.

257
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:48,306
Hello, brooke.
It's a lovely day, isn't it?

258
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:51,540
Oh! You look beautiful!

259
00:12:51,665 --> 00:12:54,374
Mother... You're glowing.

260
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:55,674
Am I?

261
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:58,908
Yes. In fact,
you've been glowing for days.

262
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:00,873
It's getting weird.

263
00:13:00,998 --> 00:13:04,506
Well... I suppose...

264
00:13:04,631 --> 00:13:06,606
It's because I've taken a lover.

265
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:08,005
Here we go.

266
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,506
Oh, he's a gentle, passionate lover.

267
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:12,530
Okay, I don't need details. Please.

268
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:15,772
It's paul, right?

269
00:13:15,897 --> 00:13:18,173
I've seen you two flirting
with each other on set,

270
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,039
And I just...Ugh!

271
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:22,105
A lady doesn't kiss and tell, honey.

272
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,738
Well, it seems to me like you're
kissing and telling right now.

273
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,671
Well, no. You asked why I
was glowing, so I told you.

274
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:30,538
You're right. My mistake.

275
00:13:30,663 --> 00:13:33,728
I'm gonna get back to work now

276
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:38,962
And try to extract a certain
horrifying image from my mind.

277
00:13:39,328 --> 00:13:41,003
Good luck with that. Me?

278
00:13:41,128 --> 00:13:42,468
I'm going to go

279
00:13:42,593 --> 00:13:46,666
And try to keep a certain
image very much in my mind.

280
00:13:48,313 --> 00:13:49,464
Gross!

281
00:13:50,354 --> 00:13:52,445
Say hi to gentle paul for me.

282
00:13:53,055 --> 00:13:55,226
Hey, millie, wait up.

283
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:57,558
I got to be honest...

284
00:13:57,683 --> 00:13:59,523
I didn't expect to see
anybody I knew here.

285
00:13:59,648 --> 00:14:01,155
Well, look, if it's weird for you,

286
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,453
We can arrange it so we're
here on separate days.

287
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:06,256
No. It's...

288
00:14:06,381 --> 00:14:08,791
I should be happy to see you.

289
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,017
It's so hard to get up in
front of bunch of strangers

290
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,483
And explain to them how you made
a complete mess of your life.

291
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:17,524
Actually, it's comforting to know

292
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:21,160
That you have someone
there listening,

293
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:24,062
Someone who understands
what you're going through.

294
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:27,282
I'm proud of you for standing up there
and sharing your story.

295
00:14:28,044 --> 00:14:29,046
Thanks.

296
00:14:30,192 --> 00:14:32,569
I still don't know how I
let it get to this point.

297
00:14:32,694 --> 00:14:35,072
I don't know. It all becomes a blur.

298
00:14:35,197 --> 00:14:37,240
The amazing thing is

299
00:14:37,365 --> 00:14:39,909
You realized that your
life was unmanageable.

300
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:43,779
Just being here is the biggest
step you've ever taken.

301
00:14:43,904 --> 00:14:46,548
Thanks, owen.

302
00:14:46,673 --> 00:14:48,816
You have no idea
how much that helps.

303
00:14:48,941 --> 00:14:50,551
Actually, I do.

304
00:14:50,676 --> 00:14:55,355
Look, you ever need someone
to lean on, you can call me.

305
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,123
I'll be there.

306
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:07,999
Dude, I told you to cover
me with a sniper rifle.

307
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:09,834
Why are you equipped with an rpd?

308
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,835
<i>Really? I should shut the hell up?</i>

309
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,921
Why don't you take a look at
my kill ratio and see who owns you?

310
00:15:15,004 --> 00:15:16,623
Yeah, that's what I thought.

311
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:20,976
Who you talking to?

312
00:15:21,101 --> 00:15:22,177
Sorry.

313
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:24,446
Uh, that was... that was skills.

314
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:28,283
We, uh... we get a
little competitive.

315
00:15:28,408 --> 00:15:29,951
Yeah, no, I can see that.

316
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:33,221
You think he's checking out
your kill ratio right now?

317
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:35,389
Yeah, just, uh,
pretend you didn't hear that.

318
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:37,891
Um, thanks for picking up lunch,
by the way.

319
00:15:38,016 --> 00:15:39,028
Sure.

320
00:15:40,585 --> 00:15:43,329
How's he doing? He's good.

321
00:15:43,454 --> 00:15:45,930
I mean, he's not good at this game,
obviously, but...

322
00:15:46,055 --> 00:15:47,598
Wait, are you two not talking?

323
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:48,932
Yeah, not so much.

324
00:15:49,057 --> 00:15:51,400
And when we do talk,
it's not really the same.

325
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:53,401
But, I mean, that's okay.

326
00:15:53,526 --> 00:15:55,603
Guess it's only natural
we'd drift apart, right?

327
00:15:55,728 --> 00:15:57,199
Distance is hard.

328
00:15:57,282 --> 00:15:59,172
It's all hard.
I mean, look at me and millie.

329
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:01,808
We live together,
but she feels so far away.

330
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:04,343
I mean, I felt closer
when I lived in omaha.

331
00:16:04,468 --> 00:16:06,011
Maybe you're right.

332
00:16:06,136 --> 00:16:09,648
It's just, the idea of starting
over sounds so scary to me.

333
00:16:09,773 --> 00:16:12,384
I will probably just stop dating.

334
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:14,785
I had a date the other night.

335
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,487
Really? Yeah. It was bizarre.

336
00:16:16,612 --> 00:16:19,089
It was like this weird
kind of '80s movie.

337
00:16:19,214 --> 00:16:20,991
But I don't know. She was cool.

338
00:16:21,116 --> 00:16:22,892
She even wants to go out again,

339
00:16:23,017 --> 00:16:25,394
But it just doesn't feel
right because of millie.

340
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,096
That's understandable.

341
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:28,397
You know what?

342
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:30,165
When you're ready, you'll just know.

343
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,201
And until then, you do have that
pretty impressive kill ratio.

344
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,274
Hey, buddy. Where's grandma?

345
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,743
She's resting.

346
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,746
You doing okay what's wrong?

347
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,272
I don't want grand toie.

348
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:10,767
Are you stalking me now? Relax.

349
00:17:10,892 --> 00:17:13,575
Brooke needed me here to do some
adjustments to the wardrobe.

350
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,907
I'm here strictly on business.

351
00:17:16,032 --> 00:17:18,441
Unless, of course, you want
to go play in your trailer.

352
00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:21,101
Nothing sounds worse
to me right now.

353
00:17:28,074 --> 00:17:30,775
Actually, I take that back.

354
00:17:54,927 --> 00:17:57,904
Did you see brooke davis's mom?

355
00:17:58,029 --> 00:17:59,639
I would totally hit that.

356
00:17:59,764 --> 00:18:01,140
I'm not even kidding.

357
00:18:01,265 --> 00:18:03,676
Right now, today, I would hit that.

358
00:18:03,801 --> 00:18:05,144
That is so sweet.

359
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:07,647
Is there a woman out there
you wouldn't sleep with?

360
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:09,450
Eh, depends on the day.

361
00:18:09,575 --> 00:18:12,018
And while we're on the subject,
actually,

362
00:18:12,143 --> 00:18:14,491
I have something kind of sensitive
I need to talk to you about.

363
00:18:14,616 --> 00:18:16,960
Our love scene today -
it's supposed to be pretty hot.

364
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:20,430
I hope it doesn't bother you
if I get a little excited.

365
00:18:20,555 --> 00:18:22,565
It's involuntary,

366
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,634
And let's face it,

367
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:26,002
You kind of do it for me.

368
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:28,170
Josh.

369
00:18:28,295 --> 00:18:29,972
Let me be very clear with you.

370
00:18:30,097 --> 00:18:31,439
If I feel anything

371
00:18:31,564 --> 00:18:34,039
Brushing up against
me under those sheets,

372
00:18:34,164 --> 00:18:36,705
<i>You will remember the pain
that I inflict on it</i>

373
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,206
For the rest of your life.

374
00:18:38,331 --> 00:18:40,099
Got it?

375
00:18:41,568 --> 00:18:43,978
She's kind of feisty.

376
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:46,113
Yeah, tell me about it.

377
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:49,416
Okay, you're officially worse than
antwon, and that is saying a lot.

378
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:50,993
No, no. The left trigger aims.

379
00:18:51,076 --> 00:18:53,853
The right trigger shoots.
So you just want to...

380
00:18:53,978 --> 00:18:56,055
And you're dead... again.

381
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,947
Don't worry,
you'll re-spawn any second.

382
00:18:59,382 --> 00:19:02,260
Why don't I get a headset?

383
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:04,094
Trust me, you're not ready for that.

384
00:19:04,219 --> 00:19:06,796
Oh, I think I am.

385
00:19:08,622 --> 00:19:10,098
Do not say you weren't warned.

386
00:19:10,223 --> 00:19:11,599
Okay, this is officially

387
00:19:11,724 --> 00:19:13,935
The most uncool thing
that I have ever done.

388
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,336
I love it.

389
00:19:15,461 --> 00:19:17,704
Hey, what do I say?
Should I brag about my kill ratio?

390
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:19,306
I would stay away from that one.

391
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:25,610
Um, h-hello, other players
in the shooting game.

392
00:19:25,735 --> 00:19:27,112
Anybody there?

393
00:19:27,237 --> 00:19:29,280
Oh, hi! Yeah, yeah, I'm a girl.

394
00:19:29,405 --> 00:19:31,148
Um, jeans.

395
00:19:31,273 --> 00:19:33,750
What do you mean, what kind
of underwear am I wearing?

396
00:19:35,815 --> 00:19:37,320
I don't know.
How old are you ?

397
00:19:37,445 --> 00:19:39,622
Oh, that's disgusting!

398
00:19:39,747 --> 00:19:40,856
You had enough?

399
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:43,158
Who are these people?
They are pure evil.

400
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:44,626
And you're one of them. No!

401
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:45,794
Yes, you are.

402
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,062
I'm sorry.

403
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,255
I didn't mean to interrupt.

404
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,967
Uh, I'll be right back.

405
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,236
You know what?
I-I have some things I need to do.

406
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,810
I'll just see you later. Okay.

407
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,377
Hey. You okay?

408
00:20:05,502 --> 00:20:06,711
Yeah. I'm fine.

409
00:20:06,836 --> 00:20:09,081
I just didn't realize you
and lauren were so close.

410
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:10,669
We're just friends.

411
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,291
OK, it's none of my business anyway.

412
00:20:12,374 --> 00:20:14,087
You can be friends
with whoever you want.

413
00:20:14,645 --> 00:20:17,154
Besides, it's not like we're together
anymore, so who really cares?

414
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,480
I guess just me.

415
00:20:30,756 --> 00:20:33,091
She told jamie.

416
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:38,905
How is he?

417
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,607
He's okay. He's sleeping.

418
00:20:41,732 --> 00:20:45,711
Well, that's her decision, haley.

419
00:20:45,836 --> 00:20:47,736
<i>We're his parents.
It should be our decision.</i>

420
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,215
He's just a kid, you know?

421
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,751
He shouldn't have to
deal with all this pain.

422
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:55,620
Aren't we supposed
to be protecting him

423
00:20:55,745 --> 00:20:57,380
From this kind of stuff?

424
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,524
Maybe it's good for
him to be prepared,

425
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:02,660
To know that he doesn't have a
lot of time with his grandma.

426
00:21:02,785 --> 00:21:04,562
And what if she gets better?

427
00:21:04,687 --> 00:21:07,487
I'm not gonna get better, haley.

428
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,499
- Hey, nathan, would you mind...
- Yeah, sure.

429
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:28,975
You're angry because I told jamie.

430
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,677
Not angry.

431
00:21:30,802 --> 00:21:32,945
I'm just upset...

432
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,281
About everything.

433
00:21:36,406 --> 00:21:38,583
I needed him to know
the truth, hales.

434
00:21:39,638 --> 00:21:40,638
Okay.

435
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,511
I just wish we could've
done it together.

436
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:46,890
Mom, he's been through a lot.

437
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:49,059
I get that.

438
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,226
I'm sorry.

439
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:56,965
I know that you think I've given up.

440
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,700
You just seem so okay
with all of this.

441
00:21:59,825 --> 00:22:01,668
No, I'm not okay.

442
00:22:01,793 --> 00:22:05,538
I'm... I'm at peace with it.

443
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:10,136
You know, I fought hard.
I... god, I promise you, I...

444
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:13,310
And then, one day, I just...

445
00:22:13,435 --> 00:22:15,679
I realized that I
had to stop fighting

446
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:20,791
And I had to start enjoying
the time that I had left.

447
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:23,717
And that's all I'm trying to do.

448
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,285
Can I ask you for something,
even though I know

449
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,720
It's something that
you don't want to hear?

450
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:32,326
Will you please let me
give your medical records

451
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,663
To nathan's doctor so that
somebody can take a look at it?

452
00:22:34,788 --> 00:22:37,132
It's just... it's not
gonna make any difference.

453
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:40,468
It may not, but I'm not
ready to lose you yet, mom,

454
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:43,270
So if there's anybody out
there who can do something,

455
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,905
I have to take that chance.

456
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,031
Will you please do that for me?

457
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:51,744
Okay.

458
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:54,313
You can give him my
medical records...

459
00:22:54,438 --> 00:22:55,914
On one condition.

460
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,551
When he comes back with
the same diagnosis,

461
00:23:01,477 --> 00:23:03,820
I need you to accept it, okay?

462
00:23:03,945 --> 00:23:05,889
Like I've accepted it.

463
00:23:06,014 --> 00:23:09,892
And, hopefully,
then we can at least try

464
00:23:10,017 --> 00:23:12,094
To enjoy the time I have left...

465
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:14,723
Together, all of us.

466
00:23:14,806 --> 00:23:15,810
Please?

467
00:23:16,589 --> 00:23:19,133
Do that for me?

468
00:23:26,597 --> 00:23:28,340
Oh, hey, there you are.

469
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:30,275
You kind of disappeared for a while.

470
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,277
I was just trying to
stay out of your way.

471
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:34,646
I don't remember telling
you to stay out of my way.

472
00:23:34,771 --> 00:23:36,782
Well, you had to shoot

473
00:23:36,907 --> 00:23:38,851
That big sex scene
with alex and josh,

474
00:23:38,976 --> 00:23:40,920
And I didn't really want
to be around for that.

475
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,832
It turned out pretty well, I think.

476
00:23:44,915 --> 00:23:47,202
Although, at one point,
Josh did let out a girlish shriek,

477
00:23:47,285 --> 00:23:49,762
And then alex stormed off to
her trailer for 10 minutes.

478
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:53,139
- Not really sure what that was.
- Actors.

479
00:23:55,926 --> 00:23:57,803
So, thanks for the sweater.

480
00:23:57,928 --> 00:23:59,738
Yeah, it's no big deal.
I mean, it's yours.

481
00:23:59,863 --> 00:24:01,564
I figured you might want it.

482
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,009
So, get this.

483
00:24:05,134 --> 00:24:09,545
I think that my mom and your dad

484
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:13,148
Have become lovers.

485
00:24:13,273 --> 00:24:15,150
We did kind of see this coming.

486
00:24:15,275 --> 00:24:16,417
Yeah.

487
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:19,286
Apparently,
your dad is quite gentle.

488
00:24:19,411 --> 00:24:20,520
What?

489
00:24:20,645 --> 00:24:24,419
Not to mention extremely passionate.

490
00:24:24,544 --> 00:24:25,887
Why are you doing this to me?

491
00:24:26,012 --> 00:24:27,722
Because I had to suffer
through it alone.

492
00:24:27,847 --> 00:24:29,657
Now we can at least be
equally traumatized.

493
00:24:29,782 --> 00:24:30,891
Thank you.

494
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:32,126
Yeah.

495
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:36,029
Wouldn't it be weird if
they ended up together?

496
00:24:36,154 --> 00:24:37,797
Honestly,
I'm kind of envious of them.

497
00:24:37,922 --> 00:24:39,756
At least they're going for it,
right?

498
00:24:42,869 --> 00:24:43,992
Yeah.

499
00:24:46,462 --> 00:24:47,738
All right, I gotta run,

500
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:50,039
But thanks again for the sweater,
brooke.

501
00:24:57,435 --> 00:24:59,378
Okay, you'll have
complete creative control,

502
00:24:59,503 --> 00:25:00,846
You'll keep publishing,

503
00:25:00,971 --> 00:25:03,414
And here's where we got a
little overly generous.

504
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,785
51% of profits and
35% of merchandising.

505
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,588
Uh, m-merchandising?

506
00:25:08,713 --> 00:25:10,693
You're gonna make
t-shirts with my face on them?

507
00:25:10,818 --> 00:25:13,396
<i>We're gonna make a lot of things
with your face on them.</i>

508
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,721
We can talk about the beard later.

509
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,601
All you have to do
is sign right here.

510
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:21,737
<i>Well, you haven't heard
my list of demands yet.</i>

511
00:25:21,862 --> 00:25:23,028
What else?

512
00:25:28,963 --> 00:25:31,320
What the hell is that?

513
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,553
Pickled eggs, of course.

514
00:25:34,071 --> 00:25:36,025
Why would something like that exist?

515
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,380
For times like this.

516
00:25:38,463 --> 00:25:41,432
My first demand... eat one.

517
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:44,588
You can't be serious.

518
00:25:45,213 --> 00:25:46,613
You're serious.

519
00:26:03,402 --> 00:26:05,205
Hey, buddy.

520
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,206
Look at all this cool stuff.

521
00:26:08,183 --> 00:26:10,298
Yeah, I'm just going
through some old things.

522
00:26:12,035 --> 00:26:13,478
Now we're talking.

523
00:26:13,603 --> 00:26:17,015
Did I ever tell you that
I'm a wiffle ball legend?

524
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,950
Yeah, a bunch of times.

525
00:26:19,075 --> 00:26:20,485
Right.

526
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,720
You know, when I was your age,

527
00:26:22,845 --> 00:26:24,088
Your grandpa dan...

528
00:26:24,213 --> 00:26:26,834
He built me a miniature
fenway park in the backyard.

529
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:30,393
Even had a green monster,
a pesky pole.

530
00:26:30,518 --> 00:26:32,628
It was pretty awesome.

531
00:26:32,753 --> 00:26:35,364
And then grandma deb made you tear
it down because it was so ugly.

532
00:26:35,489 --> 00:26:38,057
Guess I need so new stories.

533
00:26:40,026 --> 00:26:41,802
You all right, buddy?

534
00:26:41,927 --> 00:26:43,937
Is there anything you
want to talk about?

535
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:46,830
I'm fine.
I'm just a little busy right now.

536
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,566
Don't worry.
I still like your stories.

537
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:55,480
If you need me, I'm here.

538
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:57,069
Okay?

539
00:27:08,407 --> 00:27:09,418
Mouth.

540
00:27:09,866 --> 00:27:10,878
Owen.

541
00:27:12,262 --> 00:27:13,962
What are you doing here?

542
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:16,129
I'm here to pick up millie.

543
00:27:16,987 --> 00:27:18,166
Right.

544
00:27:23,451 --> 00:27:25,895
Arrgh, me matey.

545
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,096
All right,
that... that was terrible.

546
00:27:28,221 --> 00:27:30,513
And you are gonna have to
work on your pirate speak.

547
00:27:30,596 --> 00:27:32,299
But at least we're
getting somewhere.

548
00:27:32,424 --> 00:27:34,534
I did everything on your mad
e-up list of demands.

549
00:27:34,617 --> 00:27:36,006
I ate that disgusting egg - 

550
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:39,006
it doesn't sound to me like
you're working on your pirate speak.

551
00:27:40,757 --> 00:27:41,957
I ate the egg.

552
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,051
I washed your mugs with me
hands even though 

553
00:27:44,134 --> 00:27:46,046
they were perfectly clean
and didn't need it.

554
00:27:46,171 --> 00:27:49,190
- There were few water spots.
- And I called your voicemail

555
00:27:49,273 --> 00:27:51,216
Pretending to be a very
satisfied sexual partner

556
00:27:51,341 --> 00:27:53,117
Begging for one more night.

557
00:27:53,242 --> 00:27:56,220
I can't wait to play that in public.

558
00:27:56,345 --> 00:27:57,521
There. You happy?

559
00:27:57,646 --> 00:27:59,789
I did everything you asked me to.
So we're good?

560
00:27:59,914 --> 00:28:01,381
We're up to a single.

561
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:04,776
Most people would kill
for a record contract.

562
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:06,755
Here's the thing, miranda.

563
00:28:06,838 --> 00:28:08,722
Writing and performing
music for me is like...

564
00:28:08,805 --> 00:28:10,398
It's like standing naked in a crowd.

565
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,567
You're being a little dramatic.

566
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:15,203
Okay, maybe I'm in my underwear.

567
00:28:15,328 --> 00:28:18,241
But the point is,
I'm still vulnerable.

568
00:28:18,366 --> 00:28:20,444
And it wasn't just about a girl.

569
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:22,579
It was about the guy that I became.

570
00:28:22,704 --> 00:28:25,315
I didn't like him,
and neither did anyone else.

571
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,441
And I would rather
not see him come back.

572
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,989
Hello?

573
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:37,525
Oh, who's playing?

574
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,494
Syracuse and virginity tech.

575
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:43,061
Okay, that sounds like
an intriguing match-up.

576
00:28:43,186 --> 00:28:44,462
Who's winning?

577
00:28:44,587 --> 00:28:45,596
Owen.

578
00:28:45,721 --> 00:28:47,149
And owen is...

579
00:28:47,556 --> 00:28:49,265
The guy who's out
with millie right now.

580
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,936
- And I take it you're jealous?
- Of course I'm jealous.

581
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:54,517
But mostly I'm just worried,
because she doesn't need to be

582
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,337
Hanging out with an
addict right now.

583
00:28:56,462 --> 00:28:58,787
Especially not the same
addict who took her virginity.

584
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:01,576
Ohh, is that why you said
syracuse was playing...

585
00:29:01,701 --> 00:29:03,568
Yeah. Got it.

586
00:29:05,071 --> 00:29:07,148
Look, mouth...

587
00:29:07,273 --> 00:29:09,416
<i>You broke up with her, right?</i>

588
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,887
So she gna live her life.

589
00:29:12,012 --> 00:29:13,822
<i>And she should.</i>

590
00:29:13,947 --> 00:29:15,990
She can see whoever she wants.

591
00:29:16,115 --> 00:29:19,293
But if that bothers you,
then just tell her.

592
00:29:19,418 --> 00:29:22,185
Because maybe that means
it's not over foryou yet.

593
00:29:24,154 --> 00:29:27,599
So, you really think it's
over between you and mouth?

594
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,500
Honestly,
I try not to think about it,

595
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:31,468
'cause there's nothing
I can do right now.

596
00:29:31,593 --> 00:29:33,570
You sure about that?

597
00:29:33,695 --> 00:29:35,037
I don't know.

598
00:29:35,162 --> 00:29:37,805
I mean, the reason we
broke up is all my fault,

599
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,841
So my hands are pretty much tied.

600
00:29:39,966 --> 00:29:42,177
All I can do is wait to be forgiven.

601
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:45,246
<i>I can tell you what I
hope will happen,</i>

602
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:47,748
But I have no way of knowing
if he'll ever be able

603
00:29:47,873 --> 00:29:49,373
To look at me the way he used to.

604
00:29:51,476 --> 00:29:53,353
That's why I try not
to think about it.

605
00:29:53,478 --> 00:29:55,088
You know,
we should do something fun.

606
00:29:55,213 --> 00:29:56,889
Like what?

607
00:29:57,014 --> 00:29:58,924
I don't know.
We'll figure something out.

608
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:00,716
Come on.

609
00:30:06,687 --> 00:30:08,997
Oh, my gosh!
Where did you find this?

610
00:30:09,122 --> 00:30:10,798
Was it in those boxes?

611
00:30:10,923 --> 00:30:12,667
Yeah, grandma gave it to me.

612
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:14,902
Yeah. I haven't see
this photo in forever.

613
00:30:15,027 --> 00:30:16,636
Look at my hair.

614
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:18,862
I mean, I know it was
early morning, but geez.

615
00:30:22,132 --> 00:30:25,009
Hey, listen, buddy.

616
00:30:25,134 --> 00:30:28,045
I know how hard this
must be for you.

617
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:31,605
So, if you need to cry, it's okay.

618
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,418
I'm not crying for me.
I'm crying for you.

619
00:30:37,543 --> 00:30:39,511
Your mom's gonna die.

620
00:30:43,982 --> 00:30:47,461
The one thing I never want
to lose is you or daddy.

621
00:30:47,586 --> 00:30:50,196
We're not going anywhere.

622
00:30:50,321 --> 00:30:52,589
I promise.

623
00:30:58,894 --> 00:31:02,496
You're taking good
care ofy daughter.

624
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:05,875
Ooh, I remember the day

625
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,512
You came to ask our
permission to marry her.

626
00:31:08,637 --> 00:31:10,947
You were so nervous.

627
00:31:14,142 --> 00:31:16,852
But I looked into your eyes,

628
00:31:16,977 --> 00:31:18,888
And I just knew.

629
00:31:19,013 --> 00:31:20,790
What did you know?

630
00:31:20,915 --> 00:31:23,917
That were gonna change
my daughter's life.

631
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:27,454
And I was right.

632
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:32,535
You we responsible
for raising the woman

633
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,671
That changed my entire world.

634
00:31:36,566 --> 00:31:39,364
I'll never forget that, lydia, ever.

635
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,333
Thank you for saying yes.

636
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:55,459
Oh, come on!

637
00:31:55,657 --> 00:31:57,385
That's just not possible.

638
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,853
What's not possible?

639
00:31:58,978 --> 00:32:02,022
Are you referring to my
three consecutive strikes

640
00:32:02,147 --> 00:32:03,924
Or just that particular strike?

641
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:06,193
All of the above. Ah!

642
00:32:06,318 --> 00:32:08,127
Just glad we didn't put money on it.

643
00:32:08,453 --> 00:32:10,482
This was a bad idea.

644
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:12,699
<i>No, this was a really good idea.</i>

645
00:32:12,824 --> 00:32:15,024
Thanks for cheering me up, owen.
I needed it.

646
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,252
God!

647
00:32:25,966 --> 00:32:28,567
I can't even remember
the last time I laughed.

648
00:32:33,005 --> 00:32:34,338
You know he's not gone yet.

649
00:32:36,274 --> 00:32:37,550
Mouth.

650
00:32:37,675 --> 00:32:39,352
You shouldn't give up on him.

651
00:32:39,477 --> 00:32:42,254
And you can't just sit around
waiting for him to forgive you.

652
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:43,768
Look, I understand.

653
00:32:43,954 --> 00:32:45,104
As an addict,

654
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:50,460
I've ruined a lot of important
relationships in my life.

655
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:53,496
That's why,
if he's important to you,

656
00:32:53,621 --> 00:32:55,664
You got to at least
try to get him back.

657
00:32:58,291 --> 00:33:00,236
<i>I don't know how to get him back.</i>

658
00:33:03,164 --> 00:33:06,609
Just remind him of the
girl he fell in love with.

659
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,644
Show him you're still that girl...

660
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:11,846
Or that you're working
hard to try to find her.

661
00:33:11,971 --> 00:33:13,354
You do that,

662
00:33:14,356 --> 00:33:16,875
I guarantee he'll look at
you the way he used to.

663
00:33:19,977 --> 00:33:21,721
Do you mind if we get going?

664
00:33:21,846 --> 00:33:23,980
Not at all.
You're killing me anyway.

665
00:33:24,063 --> 00:33:25,613
This is embarrassing.

666
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:31,052
Thank you, owen.

667
00:33:33,355 --> 00:33:34,597
How's it going?

668
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:37,097
This place is crawling with agents.
They're like vultures.

669
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,765
Well, just remember,
you're one of them.

670
00:33:40,058 --> 00:33:42,136
Are you circling anyone right now?

671
00:33:42,219 --> 00:33:44,105
I've had a few meetings.

672
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,975
I really missed you.
I needed to hear your voice.

673
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,209
Really?

674
00:33:48,334 --> 00:33:49,376
Yeah.

675
00:33:49,501 --> 00:33:51,911
I like that. And I miss you, too.

676
00:33:52,036 --> 00:33:53,612
Hey, babe, I gotta go.

677
00:33:53,737 --> 00:33:56,261
I have a few more players to meet with,
but I'm coming home tomorrow.

678
00:33:56,344 --> 00:33:57,951
I'll be waiting. Bye.

679
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,984
All right, bye.

680
00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:01,719
Hey, that was a great match.

681
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,542
Miranda says you're torturing her.
Knock it off, okay?

682
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,147
- Really?
- No. I'm kind of loving it.

683
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,934
Hi, friendly faces.

684
00:34:11,017 --> 00:34:13,636
Do you guys mind if I play
third wheel for a little while?

685
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,062
I'm not ready to go home yet.

686
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:17,848
- Yeah, you just missed my millie rant.
- I want to hear the millie rant.

687
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,400
Oh, we've moved
on to the julian rant.

688
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,969
Ooh, great. Can you at least
start from the beginning?

689
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:24,604
You didn't miss much.

690
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,504
I was just saying

691
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:30,928
That sometimes our relationship
seems so simple and easy.

692
00:34:31,979 --> 00:34:35,012
But no matter what,
it just turns into a big mess.

693
00:34:35,137 --> 00:34:39,015
And there are days that I
want to dive into that mess,

694
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:42,485
But then, other days,
I can't help but wonder

695
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:47,022
If maybe we're just two people
who don't work as a couple.

696
00:34:47,147 --> 00:34:49,024
But you love him, right?

697
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:51,459
Like you don't even know.

698
00:34:51,584 --> 00:34:53,561
Then don't wait.

699
00:34:53,686 --> 00:34:55,863
Life's too short to play games.

700
00:34:55,988 --> 00:34:58,231
If you love somebody and
you want to be with them,

701
00:34:58,356 --> 00:34:59,633
Then go get them.

702
00:34:59,758 --> 00:35:02,502
Deal with the mess later.

703
00:35:02,627 --> 00:35:05,070
We don't know what
tomorrow will bring.

704
00:35:05,195 --> 00:35:08,639
Well... Here I am.

705
00:35:08,764 --> 00:35:10,999
Standing in front of a
crowd in my underwear.

706
00:35:18,673 --> 00:35:20,282
Feeling vulnerable?

707
00:35:20,407 --> 00:35:22,251
I'm hot, and you're talented.

708
00:35:22,376 --> 00:35:24,109
And if I can do it, so can you.

709
00:35:25,545 --> 00:35:27,655
Which is the reason
I'm standing here...

710
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,823
Because I believe in you.

711
00:35:29,948 --> 00:35:33,183
Maybe it's time for you
to believe in yourself.

712
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,853
Bugger off.

713
00:35:46,156 --> 00:35:48,049
Sorry. Bad habit.

714
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,731
You're forgiven. It was a long day.

715
00:35:51,055 --> 00:35:52,676
But at least we got
through it, right?

716
00:35:52,759 --> 00:35:54,485
Barely. I'm so tired.

717
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,439
Hopefully tomorrow
I'll be better-rested.

718
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:58,546
I can't believe a bunch of pati
o-furniture salesmen

719
00:35:58,671 --> 00:35:59,980
Kept you up all night.

720
00:36:00,105 --> 00:36:03,917
Actually, it wasn't just the pati
o-furniture guys.

721
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:06,352
I kind of slept with
alexander last night.

722
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:11,489
"Oh"? Why'd you say it like that?

723
00:36:11,614 --> 00:36:12,991
How did I say it?

724
00:36:13,116 --> 00:36:15,159
I don't know, kind of sad-sacky,

725
00:36:15,284 --> 00:36:16,966
Like maybe you're a little jealous.

726
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,069
I'm kidding. Relax.

727
00:36:19,921 --> 00:36:21,831
Let's change the subject.

728
00:36:21,956 --> 00:36:23,356
How are things with brooke?

729
00:36:25,092 --> 00:36:26,702
Obviously, we still love each other.

730
00:36:26,827 --> 00:36:29,771
But every time we get too close,
one of us puts up a wall.

731
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,507
And it's not easy being on
the other side of that wall.

732
00:36:32,632 --> 00:36:34,375
So tear down the wall.

733
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,809
You don't understand.

734
00:36:35,934 --> 00:36:37,544
When brooke davis puts up a wall,

735
00:36:37,669 --> 00:36:39,746
That thing's not coming
down until she's ready.

736
00:36:39,871 --> 00:36:42,414
And you have to wait. That's fair.

737
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:44,173
I got to get some sleep.

738
00:36:46,109 --> 00:36:49,665
Julian, if I thought you and
brooke were really just friends,

739
00:36:49,937 --> 00:36:52,547
Alexander wouldn't have been
the one in my bed last night.

740
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:56,060
Good night.

741
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:05,925
I'll walk you to your room.

742
00:37:29,097 --> 00:37:30,774
Can I help you?

743
00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:32,109
I lost my key.

744
00:37:32,234 --> 00:37:35,436
I'm staying with my boyfriend,
julianaker.

745
00:37:38,874 --> 00:37:42,853
Oh, well, um, it says
here you guys broke up.

746
00:37:42,978 --> 00:37:46,190
<i>Oh, please, that story
is so last week.</i>

747
00:37:46,315 --> 00:37:48,292
Oh, thank god.

748
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:50,394
You know what?
Can I tell you a secret?

749
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:52,853
- I wish you wouldn't.
- I've always rooted for you two.

750
00:37:53,055 --> 00:37:54,398
- Really?
- Yeah.

751
00:37:54,945 --> 00:37:56,391
Can I get that key?

752
00:38:04,064 --> 00:38:05,998
Hey. What's up?

753
00:38:08,634 --> 00:38:11,812
Just heard from the doctor.

754
00:38:11,937 --> 00:38:15,846
There's nothing they can do for her.

755
00:38:21,773 --> 00:38:23,816
I just thought... I know.

756
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:26,050
I know. I'm so sorry, baby.

757
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:30,284
I wish I could change this for you.

758
00:38:49,491 --> 00:38:51,501
Hey, I know it's late.

759
00:38:51,626 --> 00:38:54,270
I was just thinking...

760
00:38:54,395 --> 00:38:56,571
We don't know what
tomorrow will bring.

761
00:38:56,696 --> 00:38:58,339
Sometimes you just
have to go for it,

762
00:38:58,464 --> 00:39:00,641
And that's what I'm doing.

763
00:39:00,766 --> 00:39:02,976
I want to go out with you...

764
00:39:03,101 --> 00:39:04,544
On a date.

765
00:39:08,205 --> 00:39:10,338
Promise me one thing.

766
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:14,352
If I start to change

767
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:17,954
Or if I start to become that
guy that nobody likes...

768
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,155
You won't.

769
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,193
I'm gonna make sure u stay
exactly who you are...

770
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:27,929
'cause that's a person
worth protecting.

771
00:39:45,669 --> 00:39:47,426
Excuse me. Are you katie ryan?

772
00:40:36,964 --> 00:40:38,831
Now we can spend christmas together.

773
00:41:04,451 --> 00:41:06,662
It's okay, sweetheart.

774
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,873
Show me what we got here.

775
00:41:20,998 --> 00:41:22,373
Oh, thanks, buddy.

776
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:27,076
You got a sword. Oh, thank you.
