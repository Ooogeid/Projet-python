Season05 Episode12</font>

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:20,280
When I was a boy,my
family took me on a trip.

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,960
We didn't go to any exotic place.

6
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,610
We didn't go anywhere glamorous.

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,650
We just drove.

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,180
Where did you go,uncle lucas?

9
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:35,400
We drove the back road to tree hill,and
we saw all kinds of wonderful things.

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,520
Well,where were you going?

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,340
Everywhere. Anywhere.

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,380
But where we ended up
really wasn't the point.

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,780
It was the things we saw and
the people we met along the way.

14
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,560
Who was with you?

15
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,440
It was just my mom,my uncle,and me.

16
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,510
Where was your daddy?

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,360
He wasn't there.

18
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,110
but something
happened that day --

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,910
something magical.

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,960
What was it? What happened?

21
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,000
My uncle let me drive.

22
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,450
were you scared?

23
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:20,660
No,I mean,the truth is,I'm
not sure I ever felt safer.

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,180
That day,in that car with
my uncle and my mom...

25
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,490
was one of the best days of my life.

26
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,560
Just like today.

27
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,700
That's gonna make for
one beautiful bride.

28
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,590
I want to come home,haley. I love you.

29
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,700
I have to get ready right now. I can'T.

30
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,160
You shouldn't have done that.

31
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,550
I wanted to.

32
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,810
Yeah.

33
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,700
So,you want to talk about this?

34
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,860
Well,you hate my book and you think I picked
the wrong girl to spend the rest of my life with.

35
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,910
- What's there to talk about?
- Stop it.

36
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,260
You know that I love lindsey.

37
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,750
Oh,but i don't?

38
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,810
I mean,I think I do,but I guess I'm
just lying to myself. Is that your story?

39
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,340
Geez,see if I read anything
you write ever again.

40
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,560
Look,hales,you can't say that the
manuscript I gave you is about peyton.

41
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,980
It's about yearning and want,luke.

42
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,530
I think you wrote it about
peyton because you still love her.

43
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,100
And I think it's about
a guy watching the sky.

44
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,450
But thanks for caring.

45
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,190
Well,whatever you do,just don't
show those pages to lindsey.

46
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,970
I already did.

47
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,430
- Mom!
- And?

48
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,870
- Lucas?
- Mon

49
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,970
Oh,my gosh!

50
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,940
Oh,I missed you,baby boy!

51
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh,I missed you,too!

52
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,680
Haley!

53
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,820
- How are you?
- Good.

54
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,790
Oh,and who is this?

55
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,830
It's me,aunt karen
-- james lucas scott.

56
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,060
No,you are not james lucas scott.

57
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,580
Jamie scott is a baby.

58
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,540
I got bigger.

59
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,410
You got bigger! Oh,my
goodness.Look at you.

60
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,330
Where's lily?

61
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,620
Yeah,ma. Where's my little sister?

62
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,910
Your little sister is with andy.

63
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,550
I think it's really great that you

64
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,400

65
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,900
I think it's really great that
you're almostgonna get married.

66
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,300
Well,I mean,till your fiancÈe meets me.

67
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,140
I got to talk to my
momabout getting rid of you.

68
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,380
Listen,um...

69
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,040
I love your mom...

70
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,240
and lily,but I want
youto know something.

71
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,910
I'd give it all up if keith
could be hereon your wedding day.

72
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,470
And all the daysafter that.

73
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,380
Thank you.

74
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,340
I do love a wedding.

75
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,890
Perfect occasionfor a family reunion.

76
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,750
All right,dude,sit still.

77
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,970
You want to bethe second-best-looking
guy in this church,don't you?

78
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,000
Second-best?

79
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,320
Daddy!

80
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,930
Jamie's gonna be the man.

81
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,090
I'm gonna be second-best.

82
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,670
You'll be lucky to makethe top 10,luke.

83
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,950
Thanks.

84
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,010
Oh,come here. I love you,boy.

85
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,740
How much have you grownin
the last week -- a foot?

86
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,490
Maybe.

87
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,370
Aunt karendidn't even know me.

88
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,830
All right.

89
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,560
Ooh,and,daddy,did you see mama?

90
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,600
She looked pretty.

91
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,500
I'll bet.

92
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,030
You know the drill,right?

93
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,700
You're gonna lead lindseydown the aisle
with lily,and then when you getto me,

94
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,550
you're gonna give methese two rings.

95
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,100
Treasure!

96
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,150
Nice,huh?

97
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,100
And worth,like,all
the moneyin the world.

98
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,060
So when I give them to
you,don't lose them,okay?

99
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,100
'Cause uncle lucas can't finish
his secondbook,and he's poor.

100
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,780
I'm sorry you're poor,uncle lucas.

101
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,240
Thanks,jamie.

102
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,680
Hey,daddy,when you married
mama,was it your best day ever?

103
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,760
Actually,I think the dayI graduated
high school was my best day ever.

104
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:15,930
How come?

105
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,000
Well,'cause that's the dayyou were born.

106
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,450
Now,lace 'em up. Chop-chop.

107
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,330
Got any intel for mewith my girl?

108
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,870
Not really.

109
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,690
She misses you. She's still stubborn.

110
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,290
Same as last week.

111
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,250
But I'll tell you,it kind of
sucks for youthat my mom's here.

112
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,150
Why's that?

113
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,850
Well,she raised a son with a
really great uncleand no husband.

114
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,500
Dan sucks.

115
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,060
Flowers for the bride...

116
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,290
who's clearly not here. Sorry.

117
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,920
Both:I'll take 'em.

118
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,120
Dude,you got to give methis one.

119
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,890
If I take these flowersto lindsey,I
get some face timewith haley.

120
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,290
Forget it,man. Lindsey's been staying
with haley to make itall romantic.

121
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,470
I haven't seen her in a week.

122
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,950
So? It's bad luck.

123
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,810
Besides,what do you thinkis gonna go
down before your weddingin a church?

124
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,690
Oh,you underestimate me.

125
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,280
Lucas,you're going to hell. Listen.

126
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,700
You and lindseyare good,okay.

127
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,350
You're still in
thatblissed-out,best-underwear,she-still-laughsat-your-stupid-jokes phase.

128
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,280
My jokes aren't stupid.

129
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,750
That's what you think. Look,the
point is,I need this,okay?

130
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,340
I'm fading fast here.

131
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,260
Haley: Oh,flowers from a gentleman.

132
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,150
Hey,we can help you outwith that.

133
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,310
Hey,look who it is.

134
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,290
Sorry,bad luck.

135
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,190
"Hey,look who it is"?

136
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,500
No wonder you're fading.

137
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,510
Lily.

138
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,360
Oh,I sure did miss you.

139
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,140
You think you can letyour big
brother lucas in and come say hello?

140
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,360
No! You're bad luck!

141
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,900
How did i get so lucky?

142
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,220
You know,if I knew beingengaged would be
like this,I'd have proposedwhen we met.

143
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,490
It's the book.

144
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,270
The book? My book?

145
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,070
I love it,lucas.

146
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,110
I love what you wrote,and
I love that you wrote it.

147
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,190
It's so romantic.

148
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,730
Okay,we can definitelytalk
about this later.

149
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,860
You know,can
I ask you --

150
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,240
How do you mean "romantic"?

151
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,220
What?

152
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:33,600
Well,I'm glad you like itand all,but
I didn't reallyexpect "romantic."

153
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,110
I mean,it's about a
scientistand the stars.

154
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,960
Luke,are you kidding me?

155
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,180
I cried so much.

156
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:46,120
He's justthis lost little boy,and then he
seesthe comet,and suddenly,his life has meaning.

157
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,440
And then he waits his whole
lifefor the comet to return.

158
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:53,200
He has faith that it will,even though
science and hisintellect tells him it won'T.

159
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,280
His heart still believes.

160
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,640
It's beautiful,lucas.

161
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,750
And heartbreaking.

162
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,460
It's an epic love story.

163
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,160
It's about a comet.

164
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,920
It's about lovein its purest form.

165
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,350
When I think about how it camefrom
your heart and your mind...

166
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,380
it makes me so happy to
knowthat I found you...

167
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,610
and that I get to beyour wife.

168
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,570
Thank you.

169
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,370
I love you,lindsey.

170
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,560
I love you,lucas.

171
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,510
I'm sorry,we're closed!

172
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,840
Oh,my god.

173
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,350
Do you hate me?

174
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,330
No,I am proud of you!

175
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,870
I missed you! How's lily?

176
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,390
Oh,she's good. She's very girly.

177
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,590
But you'll see herat the wedding.

178
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,680
God,unless I'm so latethat I miss it.

179
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,400
I'm supposed to be there --
you're supposed to be there!

180
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,720
I just wanted to come byand see the caf?

181
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,770
and see youand maybe catch peyton.

182
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,270
- She's on her way.
- Good.

183
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,660
How's she doing?

184
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,770
She's a mess.

185
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,670
She's trying to put ona
brave face and be noble,

186
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,510
- but we all thought this wasgonna be her day.
- Yeah.

187
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,380
And how are you? Are you happy?

188
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,040
You are doing so well.

189
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,240
Thank you.

190
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,210
It's hard,but
I'm -- I'm happy.

191
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,120
At least I'm trying to be.

192
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,890
Can I ask you something?

193
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,020
I made lindsey'swedding gown,and it got me to
thinking about how I was supposedto make yours.

194
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,810
It's okay.

195
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,560
It's not okay,and somehow
you managedto make it okay.

196
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:05,280
And I just wonder,I mean,I've always
wonderedwhere that strength comes from.

197
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,670
That dignity and gracethat

198
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,150
you have put on in the face of
everythingthat's happened in your life.

199
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,980
Because I really want to
bethat kind of person someday.

200
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,990
You already are,brooke davis.

201
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,900
You've come furtherthan anyone I know.

202
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:33,510
And if you want to knowa secret,you've
just scratchedthe surface.

203
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,960
Thank you.

204
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,380
Hey,brooke,come on.
We're gonna be --

205
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,910
Thank you for my office!

206
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,200
Oh,you are so welcome.

207
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,030
I-I know we have to go,but there really is
somethingI wanted to tell you -- both of you.

208
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,450
You know,in life,if you let it,you can
always come upwith reasons to give up.

209
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:02,640
But if you don't,you might just find
lovein places you never imagined --

210
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,200
in a new relationshipor in your work...

211
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,260
or in your children.

212
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,140
Whatever it is,just don't give up on it.

213
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:20,110
And if you don't get it,well,you
might getsomething better.

214
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,930
That's what you haveto call me.

215
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,960
I do not.

216
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,990
Do so.

217
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,530
Say it. "Aunt lily."

218
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,460
You look like cinderella!

219
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,550
I cannot believe we don't
havedates for this thing.

220
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,300
What kind of boyfriendtakes his guy
roommate camping for the weekend?

221
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,050
Jake gyllenhaal?

222
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,620
*******

223
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,810
- Ah,what up,what up?Who want a beer?
- I do.

224
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,790
You're tailgatingat luke's wedding.

225
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,690
Like you don't want one.

226
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,070
I'm designated driver.

227
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,750
So,what up,P. Sawyer?

228
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,010
You got a plan?

229
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,370
A plan for what?

230
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,520
To steal lucas back.

231
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,160
Oh,so I'm the only
onethinking like that,huh?

232
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,600
Okay,look. Here's the drill.

233
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,700
When they say,"does anybody have any
reason that this thing shouldn'tgo down?"

234
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,260
Bam,that's you.

235
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,010
They don't do thatat
real weddings,skills.

236
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,220
They should,though.

237
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,020
You know,that's good drama.

238
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,890
Anyway. How about this?

239
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,210
I say we drug lindsey first
--even though I love her.

240
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,520
Then we throw youin the wedding gown,so
when lucas lift upthe veil,bam,it's on.

241
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,690
Um,skills?

242
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,370
That gownis tailor-made,so,no.

243
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,710
And peytonis gonna be okay.

244
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,370
Right.

245
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,630
You know I love you,P. Sawyer,right?

246
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,970
But,baby girl,you are so far from
okay,man,you ain't evenin the same area code.

247
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,670
Wait.

248
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,000
Maybe lucas will saythe wrong name on
the altar just like ross didon "friends."

249
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,240
Okay. How about this?

250
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,610
How about peyton puts ona nice
dress,watches lucas get married,gets wasted,

251
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,040
and has drunk,meaningless sex
with some guyat the reception?

252
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,800
Yes.

253
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:16,370
Hey,baby,I ever tell you
howsexy you look in that dress?

254
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,810
Maybe we should head in.

255
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,820
Hey,uh,aren't youwatching jamie?

256
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,450
You know what? You right.

257
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,770
We got to get one for him,too.

258
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,630
Let's do it!

259
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,840
See y'all inside.

260
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,260
I meant what I said.

261
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,360
You're gonna be okay.

262
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,770
No,I know. I
know.I just --

263
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,080
I just needa minute,you know?

264
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,170
Okay.

265
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,260
I'll save you a seat.

266
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,970
Can I help you?

267
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,100
Hello,haley.

268
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:26,850
Save it.

269
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,760
You're not goinginto that church.

270
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,090
And you're not gonna talkto my son,my
husband,karen,or lucas,for that matter.

271
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,830
You should be carefulabout
being so bossy.

272
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,540
I've been in prisona long time.

273
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,570
Kind of sexy.

274
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,170
Don't screw with me,dan.

275
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,210
This is the last conversationyou
and I will ever have.

276
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,750
Enjoy your reprehensible,miserable life.

277
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,140
Nathan:You ready for this?

278
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,790
Yeah. I'm ready.

279
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,370
All right,well,I'm not
muchfor speeches,but,um...

280
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,890
you're a good guy,luke.

281
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,940
You're a good friend,and
you're a great brother.

282
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,210
Whatever life throws at
you,I got your back,all right?

283
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,530
Thanks.

284
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,160
All right. That's us.

285
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,870
What are you thinking,mrs. Scott?

286
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,450
Big things.

287
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,140
Big,important things.

288
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,040
Like,"this isn't how I
picturedmy wedding night"?

289
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,090
No.

290
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:19,640
Like,this is the night we'regonna tell our
children about,and our children'schildren.

291
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,570
I'd like to havekids someday.

292
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,010
- A son with your eyes?
- No.

293
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,200
A little girljust like you.

294
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:36,400
I am gonna love you
forever,haley james scott.

295
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,560
I promise.

296
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:52,610
You're welcome to watchfrom here,but
I'm sure you can find a seatdown below.

297
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,860
No,I'm fine. My son's the ring bearer.

298
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,240
- It's you.
- What?

299
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,800
When all my dreams come
true,the one I want next to me.

300
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,970
It's you.

301
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,420
It's you,peyton.

302
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,480
We give
thanks today --

303
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:31,230
for lucas and lindsey,for their
open heartsand their willing spirits,

304
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,420
and for their closest friendsand family.

305
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:39,630
May we all be changed by
whatis said and witnessed here.

306
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,710
I got you,P. Sawyer.

307
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,890
Behave or I will spank you.

308
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,160
*********

309
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:52,530
*******

310
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,170
It's a lot to process,I know.

311
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,190
But now you knowwhy I came home.

312
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,600
Brooke,are you sure?

313
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:10,040
I mean... are you sure?

314
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,100
I'm sure.

315
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,270
My heart is sure.

316
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,080
This is what I want.

317
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:25,840
It's a mysteryhow we fall in love,

318
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,530
who we fall in love
with,why we fall in love.

319
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,120
But we do.

320
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,750
Lucas eugene scott,do you
takelindsey evelyn strauss

321
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,520
to beyour lawfully wedded wife?

322
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,170
- Do you -- -
Lucas,you can't!

323
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,750
That's whatI'm talking about!

324
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,280
I'm sorry. I'm --I'm sorry,but
you just -- you can't,

325
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:55,740
because i love you,and
because you fixed my car!

326
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,660
Oh,boy.

327
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,600
Remember that day?

328
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,670
Because that daychanged everything,and
I didn't know itat the time.

329
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,800
But when you fixed my
car,you fixed my heart.

330
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:07,460
And when you proposed to metwo
years ago,I just wasn't ready.

331
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:12,410
And I was lost and scared,so I said
"someday,"but someday's now,luke,it is.

332
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,900
Someday is now,and I love you.

333
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,720
Please don't leave me again.

334
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,430
People always leave.

335
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:26,110
Do you promise to be trueto her?

336
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,620
Peyton: At least,that's
what I should have said.

337
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,720
In sicknessand in health...

338
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,520
instead,I said nothing.

339
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,680
- And he said...
- as long as you bothshall live?

340
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,990
I do.

341
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,460
- Lucas scott,you have declared your love...
- I got to goto the bathroom.

342
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,260
- All right,let's go.
- Can I go by myself?

343
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,800
Lily will make fun of me.

344
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,730
Let me do it. I know where it is.

345
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,750
All right,but you
comeright back,you hear me?

What are you doing here,nanny carrie?

353
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,590
Your mom and dad saidI

354
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,990
Oh,I get you back,and
I'm so happy. Come on.

355
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,170

Jamie,you know I love you.

357
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,830
Don't you trust me?

358
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,360
Okay.

00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,580

361
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,300
- It was a comet.
- Excuse me?

362
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,970
It was a comet,luke.

363
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,760
Could you just give usa moment,please?

364
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,330
The boy saw a comet.

365
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,890
Okay.

366
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,650
The boy saw the comet,and he felt
as though his lifehad meaning.

367
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,940
And when it went away,he waited his
entire lifefor it to come back to him.

368
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:28,090
Lindsey,I love you,but this really
isn't the timefor a book review,okay?

369
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,500
What was the first dayyou

370
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,420
- Lindsey
- - please.

371
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,520
Her car broke down.

372
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,360
That's me inside your head.

373
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,930
What?

374
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,110
Nofx.

375
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,380
Come on. Let me give you a ride.

376
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:22,610
The boy saw the comet...

377
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:26,970
and suddenlyhis life had meaning.

378
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,690
I'm sorry,lucas.

379
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,860
I can't marry you.

380
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,650
- I'm sorry,lucas.
- She's gone.

381
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,250
I never took the time to makeher
feel comfortable with my history.

382
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,800
I never took the timeto explain it all.

383
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,940
So what are you gonna do?

384
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,370
What happens next?

385
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,770
I want her back.

386
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,740
Then go get her.

387
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,130
You're lucas scott.

388
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,000
Come on.Screw that. Listen to me.

389
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,950
You're lucas scott,okay?

390
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,290
I've seen you do great things.

391
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,150
I've seen you do someof
the greatest things.

392
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,190
Now,you need to lookinto your heart
and ask yourselfwhat you truly want,

393
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,320
and if the answer is
lindsey,then just go get her,man.

394
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,180
She doesn't stand a chance.

395
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,720
Hey,you're my brother.

396
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,590
I'm here for you.

397
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,610
Now go.

398
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,160
Go on,man.

399
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,590
Jamie!

400
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,970
- Sweetie,have you seen jamie?
- No.

401
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,910
Jamie!

402
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,870
Jamie!

403
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,730
Haley,any luck?

404
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,490
No. I'm really getting worriedright now.

405
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,560
Dan was here.

406
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,700
I saw him
earlier.What do --

407
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,100
no luck inside. I'm sorry.

408
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,090
I'm so sorry,haley.

409
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,230
I should have went with him.

410
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,170
Mouth and millicent are
takinganother look around back.

411
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,310
Jamie!

412
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,480
Jamie!

413
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:28,010
Well,that wasa crazy wedding,huh?

414
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:37,710
Did I ever tell you the oneabout the
girl who got everythingshe ever wanted?

415
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,120
Did she feel horrible?

416
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,250
At first.

417
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,190
But it's only 'cause
she hada good heart.

418
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,180
And then she fixedher makeup and smoothed outher
pretty dress and went and talked to the boyshe loves.

419
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,950
He said "I do," brooke.

420
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,030
The minister askedif he would love and
cherish lindsey forever,and he said "I do."

421
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,140
Bitch,you need to stop.

422
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,870
Sorry. Okay.

423
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,510
Peyton,do you want to
know whyI came home?

424
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,290
Besides to help you.

425
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,810
I am 22 years old,and I have made more
moneythan I could ever hope to spend,

426
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:20,220
and I have never felt
more alonein my life.

427
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:24,510
You need to talkto him,peyton.

428
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,990
Just talk to him.

429
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,150
And if you let the factthat
lucas said "I do" today to lindsey

430
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,750
while he wasobviously lying to his own
heart be the reasonthat you sit here and cry,

431
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,430
I am gonna smack
youacross your pretty face.

432
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:41,700
Come on.

433
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,570
It's okay.

434
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:55,140
I want to have a baby.

435
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:59,720
- With me?
- No.

436
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:07,660
I've spent four yearsworking these
endless hours to fill this void that

437
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:11,130
all the success inthe
world is never gonna fill,

438
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:16,030
and I realized that whatI
actually want is to have a family.

439
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,670
It's okay.

440
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,430
Luke lookedreally freaked out
when we talkedabout it,too.

441
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,920
Sorry,guys. Have you seen jamie?

442
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,410
No. Why?

443
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,420
- He's missing.
- What?

444
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,900
Haley. Hey,what's going on?

445
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,000
- Jamie's gone,and dan was here.
- What?

446
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,170
He's missing. Dan came by.

447
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:41,160
I told him he wasnot to come into the church,and
now he's gone --we've looked everywhere!

448
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,310
What the hellare you doing?

449
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,430
- My son is missing,okay?
- All right,calm down.

450
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,780
You could have gotyourself killed.

451
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,910
We just leftthe wedding,okay?

452
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,790
All the guests are
gone,and my son is missing.

453
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,600

Have you beento the reception?

456
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,370
What kind of question is
that? Have I been drinking?

457
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,450
- Hey,you need to listen to me.
- No,you listen to me!

and his worldwould be whole again,"

520
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,870
and his belief in godand love and
art would be reawakenedin his heart."

521
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:06,110
Lindsey,it's just a story.

522
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,550
I mean,so what?

523
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,660
Peyton's car is just a comet,you know?

524
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,070
But this is crazy.

525
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,710
I love you.

526
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,220
I love you,too,lucas.

527
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:22,560
I do,and I always will.

528
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:30,650
But your heart'sconflicted,and
I thinkI've always known it.

529
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:35,020
I guess I was hopingthat someday...

530
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:38,250
I could be your comet.

531
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,840
It's an epic love story,luke.

532
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,390
It's just not ours.

533
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,690
And neither is this.

534
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,750
Lindsey,please.

535
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,890
You can't just leave.

536
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,660
People always leave,luke.

537
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,010
You know that.

538
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,490
jamie?

539
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:30,020
I'm back! I'm gonna find you.

540
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:35,340
I'm gonna get you. Jamie.

541
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,280
I think you're wrong.

542
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:41,570
I think I'm gonna get you.

543
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,950
My name is dan scott.

544
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,890
I think you know my grandson. It's okay.

545
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,880
You can blink oncefor "yes."

546
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,340
That's what I thought.

547
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:58,020
Well,you're done knowing
himfor the rest of time.

548
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:03,750
And if you forget,or if you decide to
go anywherenear my family ever again...

549
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:08,630
let's just say this -- I
killed my brotherin cold blood.

550
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,020
I'd have no problemkilling you.

551
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,260
I will never forgive myself.

552
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:31,510
He has to come home. He has to.

553
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:39,820
is it okay if I playwith this?

554
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,700
haley.

555
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:01,200
I'm so sorry. It's gonna be okay.

556
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:05,770
You got tobelieve that,okay?
He's gonna come home.

557
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,010

558
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:32,130
Sweetie,what happened
to you? Are you okay?

559
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,450
I'm fine. Grandpa dan saved me.

560
