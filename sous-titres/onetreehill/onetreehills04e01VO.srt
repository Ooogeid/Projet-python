1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:05,960
?

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,720
??

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,610
?

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:17,950
??

5
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,620
MY NAME IS LUCAS SCOTT.

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,320
I'M A SENIOR  AT TREE HILL HIGH SCHOOL.

7
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:37,820
TREE HILL IS JUST A PLACE  SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD.

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,320
MAYBE IT'S  A LOT LIKE YOUR WORLD.

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,390
MAYBE IT'S NOTHING LIKE IT.

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,590
BUT IF YOU LOOK CLOSER...

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,220
YOU MIGHT SEE  SOMEONE LIKE YOU

12
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,090
OR SOMEONE  LIKE MY BEST FRIEND,HALEY.

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,920
IF YOU'RE MARRIED,A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL,

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,420
AND NOT SURE  IF YOUR HUSBAND IS STILL ALIVE,

15
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,960
THEN I'D SAY YOUR WORLD  IS A LOT LIKE HALEY'S.

16
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:08,960
TODAY WAS SUPPOSED TO  BE THE BEST DAY OF HER LIFE.

17
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,790
BUT IT'S AMAZING HOW THINGS CAN  CHANGE IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE

18
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:18,160
OR,IN THIS CASE,IN ABOUT 29 MINUTES.

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,180
WHAT?

20
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,500
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT RACHEL GOT DRUNK AND STOLE OUR WEDDING LIMO.

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,240
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOUR UNCLE COOPER SLEPT WITH RACHEL.

22
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,700
SHE'S 17. WHAT IS HE,LIKE 30?

23
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,460
HE MUST NOT HAVE KNOWN.

24
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,190
I MEAN,HE COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN,RIGHT?

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,530
WHEN WE SLEPT TOGETHER THAT NIGHT,YOU KNEW I WAS 17.

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,190
RACHEL,ENOUGH.

27
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,830
MAYBE IT COULD WORK,COOPER.

28
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,180
YOU KNOW? WE'RE GOOD TOGETHER.

29
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,010
MAYBE THE AGE DIFFERENCE DOESN'T MATTER.

30
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,460
IT DOES MATTER,ALL RIGHT?

31
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,270
NOW,LISTEN TO ME.WE'RE GONNA TAKE THIS LIMOUSINE BACK TO THE RECEPTION,

32
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,420
AND THEN YOU AND I NEVER HAPPENED.

33
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,860
ISN'T THERE ANYTHING I CAN SAY TO KEEP YOU,COOPER?

34
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,640
NO. I'M SORRY,THERE'S NOT.

35
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,510
WELL,THAT'S TOO BAD.

36
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,550
BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

37
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,080
I'M PREGNANT.

38
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,750
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

39
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,770
PULL OVER.

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,120
NO,I'M NOT LETTING YOU OUT OF THIS CAR UNTIL WE TALK ABOUT THIS.

41
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,500
NO! HEY! GET YOUR HANDS OFF THE WHEEL!

42
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,210
I SAID,"PULL OVER!"

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,480
LOOK OUT!

44
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,950
THAT WAS COOPER.

45
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,940
COOPER! COOPER!

46
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,280
HALEY,CALL 911.

47
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,170
NATHAN,DON'T!

48
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,280
I LOVE YOU.

49
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,680
DON'T.

50
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,230
NATHAN!

51
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,790
NATHAN! NATHAN!

52
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,380
OH,GOD.

53
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,620
HELP ME!

54
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,480
HELP,PLEASE!

55
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,650
OH,STOP! STOP!

56
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,520
OH,LUCAS!

57
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,910
COOPER WENT OVER THE BRIDGE,AND NATHAN JUMPED OVER,

58
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,580
AND HE HASN'T COME UP FOR A REALLY LONG TIME.

59
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,770
NATHAN!

60
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,510
OH,GOD. NATHAN!

61
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,040
OH,GOD,NATHAN.

62
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,810
DID YOU CALL 911?

63
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,610
I DID! I CALLED!

64
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,980
HELP HIM,LUKE!

65
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,650
NATHAN!

66
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,990
IT'S COOPER!

67
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,800
I CAN'T FIND THEM!

68
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,500
WHAT?!

69
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,670
I CAN'T FIND THEM!

70
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,990
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? HE'S DOWN THERE.

71
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,330
NO,THE CAR IS EMPTY.

72
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,950
NATHAN!

73
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,720
NATHAN!

74
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,820
NATHAN!

75
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,120
I DON'T WANT TO BE ANYTHING

76
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,790
OTHER THAN WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO BE LATELY

77
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,620
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS THINK OF ME

78
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,450
AND I HAVE PEACE OF MIND

79
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,450
I DON'T WANT TO BE ANYTHING

80
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,120
OTHER THAN WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO BE LATELY

81
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,820
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS THINK OF ME

82
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,650
AND I HAVE PEACE OF MIND

83
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,320
I'M TIRED OF LOOKING 'ROUND ROOMS

84
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,150
WONDERING WHAT I GOTTA DO

85
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,690
OR WHO I'M SUPPOSED TO BE

86
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,190
I DON'T WANT TO BE ANYTHING

87
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,890
OTHER THAN ME

88
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,170
I CAN'T FIND HIM!

89
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,930
NATHAN!

90
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,970
NATHAN!

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,970
NATHAN!

92
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,770
OH,MY GOD. HALEY,DON'T LOOK.

93
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,970
OH,GOD!

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,500
NATHAN!

95
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,830
THINGS THAT TAKE 14 MINUTES --  BOILING AN OSTRICH EGG,

96
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,330
MICHAEL JACKSON'S  "THRILLER" VIDEO.

97
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,170
IT ALSO TAKES 14 MINUTES  TO GET FROM THE MOLINA BRIDGE

98
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,330
TO TREE HILL HOSPITAL.

99
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:04,000
IN THOSE 14 MINUTES,THREE  LIVES HUNG IN THE BALANCE.

100
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:08,000
FOR THE REST OF US,THERE WAS  NOTHING TO DO BUT WAIT.

101
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,670
I GUESS THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT  "THE WAITING ROOM."

102
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,160
SOMEONE SHOULD CALL DAN.

103
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,110
DAN SCOTT IS MANY THINGS --

104
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,330
THE MAYOR OF TREE HILL,

105
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,410
A ONCE-GREAT  HIGH-SCHOOL BASKETBALL PLAYER,

106
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,010
AND NATHAN'S FATHER.

107
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,270
HE'S ALSO MY FATHER,BUT HE NEVER CLAIMED ME.

108
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,890
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,I GOT  THE BETTER END OF THE DEAL.

109
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,820
I WAS INSTEAD RAISED BY MY MOM

110
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,340
WITH HELP  FROM MY UNCLE KEITH...

111
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,920
UNTIL KEITH'S LIFE WAS TAKEN.

112
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,060
YOU ARE NO LONGER MY BROTHER,YOU SON OF A BITCH.

113
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,150
YOU DO NOT EXIST TO ME.

114
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,750
HEY,ANY NEWS,MOM?

115
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,580
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS PREGNANCY.

116
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,190
KEITH WOULD BE SO HAPPY.

117
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,870
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE HAVING HIS BABY.

118
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,920
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT PREGNANCY.

119
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,340
WHOSE TEST DID YOU FIND AT THE RECEPTION?

120
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,830
WAS IT BROOKE'S?

121
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,970
I'M NOT SURE YET.

122
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,550
I'M YOUR MOTHER,LUCAS.

123
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,120
AND CONSIDERING THAT I WAS PREGNANT AT 17,

124
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,660
I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF

125
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,320
HISTORY IS REPEATING ITSELF WITH MY SON AND HIS GIRLFRIEND.

126
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,940
NATHAN'S AWAKE.

127
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,150
SO,WHAT,THE WEDDING WASN'T ENOUGH?

128
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,200
YOU NEEDED EVEN MORE ATTENTION?

129
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,420
THANK YOU,LUKE.

130
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,770
FOR WHAT?

131
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,370
FOR SAVING MY LIFE.

132
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,050
I JUST GOT COOPER TO SHORE,MAN.

133
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,730
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAVED EVERYBODY.

134
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,920
YOU'RE A HERO,NATE.

135
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,530
HELP ME!

136
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,690
HALEY!

137
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,810
IF I SAY I LOVE YOU,

138
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,970
WILL YOU HOLD IT AGAINST ME?

139
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,850
BROOKE,I THINK I STILL HAVE FEELINGS FOR LUCAS.

140
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,510
YOU'RE A BACKSTABBING,TWO-FACED BITCH,PEYTON.

141
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,050
AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED,THIS FRIENDSHIP IS OVER.

142
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,180
AND IF WE NEVER SPEAK AGAIN FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES,

143
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,680
THAT WILL BE FINE.

144
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,810
YOU MADE THE WRONG CHOICE

145
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,680
YOU MADE THE WRONG CHOICE

146
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:42,850
YOU MADE THE WRONG CHOICE

147
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,350
YOU MADE THE WRONG CHOICE

148
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,850
OH,NO

149
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,510
I MUST BECOME AGAIN

150
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,850
OH,NO

151
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,010
I MUST BE GETTING SO

152
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,850
OH,ELIAS,YOUR BRAIN'S ON FIRE

153
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,350
IT LOOKS LIKE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS YOU KILLED ME.

154
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,710
SHUT UP,YOU LITTLE SMART-ASS GHOST.

155
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,380
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE MY SUGAR GOD

156
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,050
I WAS IN LOVE

157
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,210
NOW I'M ALONE,ALL ALONE ON THE COUNTRYSIDE

158
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,280
WHAT AM I DOING?

159
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,520
NO. I'M DEFINITELY NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS.

160
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:30,780
YOU MADE THE WRONG CHOICE

161
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,150
SOMEONE'S IN TROUBLE.

162
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,720
YOU MADE THE WRONG CHOICE

163
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,650
YOU MADE THE WRONG

164
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,940
MAYOR SCOTT,IT'S THE POLICE.

165
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,970
YOU,UH,CAUGHT ME RED-HANDED.

166
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,830
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,MAYOR,BUT YOUR SON'S HAD AN ACCIDENT.

167
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,050
WHICH ONE?

168
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,050
MAYOR SCOTT,DO YOU KNOW HOW BADLY HURT YOUR SON IS?

169
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,220
MAYOR,WILL THIS AFFECT HIS BASKETBALL CAREER?

170
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,750
I APPRECIATE CONCERN FOR NATHAN,BUT RIGHT NOW,

171
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,950
I'M JUST A WORRIED FATHER WHO NEEDS TO SEE HIS SON.

172
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,080
LUKE.

173
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,420
HEY,SKILLS.

174
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,580
WHAT'S UP,MAN? BEVIN HEARD ABOUT THE ACCIDENT.

175
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,080
HOW ARE NATHAN AND HALEY DOING?

176
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,250
I THINK THEY'LL BE OKAY.

177
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,920
COOL. HOW ABOUT YOU?

178
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,080
I'M FINE.

179
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,420
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

180
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,920
'CAUSE BEVIN HEARD YOU AND BROOKE

181
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,920
HAD A LITTLE FRICTION AT THE WEDDING.

182
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,980
MAN,YOU KNOW BEVIN BE HEARING THINGS,DAWG.

183
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,650
LOOK,UH,BROOKE KIND OF FOUND OUT

184
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,650
THAT I KISSED PEYTON... AGAIN.

185
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,880
WOW.

186
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,120
WELL,IT'S A GOOD THING YOU IN THE HOSPITAL

187
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,780
'CAUSE YOUR SORRY ASS IN BAD SHAPE,BRO.

188
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,450
THANKS. IT WAS THE SCHOOL SHOOTING.

189
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,280
PEYTON WAS SCARED. SHE KISSED ME,AND I LET HER.

190
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,050
WELL,LOOK,JUST IN CASE BROOKE DECIDES TO SHOW UP,

191
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,520
I DON'T WANT TO BE STANDING TOO CLOSE TO YOU.

192
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,910
LOOK,IF YOU NEED SOMETHING,DAWG,CALL ME.

193
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,850
SAME GO FOR HALEY.

194
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,580
LUCAS.

195
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,150
AND TRY NOT TO MAKE OUT WITH HER,PLEASE.

196
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,310
HEY,HOW'S NATHAN? IS HE OKAY?

197
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,100
YEAH. I THINK SO. HE'S AWAKE.

198
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,570
RACHEL AND COOPER ARE STILL UNCONSCIOUS.

199
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,400
I'M SORRY.

200
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,090
PEYTON SAWYER IS A GOOD FRIEND.

201
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,430
BROOKE DAVIS IS MY GIRLFRIEND.

202
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,610
AT LEAST,FOR NOW SHE IS.

203
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,110
SLUT.

204
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,610
BITCH.

205
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,640
WHORE.

206
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,410
WELL,I KNOW I'M NOT IN HEAVEN

207
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,140
'CAUSE THEY'D NEVER LET BROOKE DAVIS' SKANKY ASS THROUGH THE GATES.

208
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:19,640
AND YOUR ASS WOULDN'T FIT,AT LEAST NOT THE OLD ONE.

209
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,320
HOW ARE YOU?

210
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,680
IS COOPER OKAY?

211
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,220
I DON'T KNOW. I'M SORRY.

212
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,720
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED?

213
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,070
WE WERE ARGUING. ABOUT WHAT?

214
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,920
I TOLD HIM I WAS PREGNANT.

215
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,720
BUT I LIED.

216
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,890
I'M NOT PREGNANT. I JUST WANTED TO SCARE HIM.

217
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,220
BROOKE.

218
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,750
I TRIED TO CALL YOU.

219
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,620
YEAH,I KNOW. I CAME AS SOON AS I GOT YOUR VOICE MAIL.

220
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,790
I'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.

221
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,620
AFTER YOU LEFT THE RECEPTION,I FOUND YOUR PURSE AND...

222
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:17,290
IT HAD A PREGNANCY TEST IN IT.

223
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,620
WE ALL GOT THE SAME PURSE AS WEDDING GIFTS.

224
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:24,290
IT HAD THAT PERFUME YOU WEAR.

225
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,720
LOOK,THE TEST WASN'T...

226
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,150
I'M NOT PREGNANT,OKAY?

227
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,350
I PROMISE.

228
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,820
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

229
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,920
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.

230
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,590
YEAH,SURE. I UNDERSTAND.

231
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,990
HOW ABOUT YOU,HALEY?

232
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,520
NOT EXACTLY THE HONEYMOON YOU PLANNED.

233
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,920
IT'S OKAY. LONDON CAN WAIT.

234
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,920
HOW'S THE KNEE,DOC?

235
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,750
OH,IT'LL BE FINE,JUST SORE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

236
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,250
I'D LIKE TO RUN A COUPLE OF TESTS,IF YOU DON'T MIND.

237
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,750
YEAH.

238
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,590
UH,DEB,DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

239
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,220
WE,UH,HAVEN'T EXACTLY...

240
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,340
...TALKED ABOUT YOUR CONFESSION,HAVE WE?

241
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,040
YOU TRIED TO KILL ME IN THE DEALERSHIP FIRE.

242
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:29,040
GO AHEAD,SCREAM FOR SOMEONE TO ENFORCE YOUR LITTLE RESTRAINING ORDER.

243
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,840
WHAT? I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

244
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,950
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

245
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,080
THAT WOULD BE NATHAN.

246
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,280
YOU SEE,HE'S THE SON. YOU'RE THE BITCH.

247
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,480
YOU LISTEN TO ME. NO,YOU LISTEN TO ME.

248
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,170
YOU DON'T KNOW THE HELL YOU UNLEASHED WHEN YOU BLEW IT,

249
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,610
AND NOW IT'S MY TURN.

250
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,910
SO YOU BE AFRAID,DEB.

251
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,410
BE MORE THAN AFRAID.

252
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,840
IT'S OKAY. I'VE GOT IT.

253
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,450
I WAS GONNA SURPRISE YOU WHEN WE GOT BACK.

254
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,140
IT'S THE LONDON BRIDGE.

255
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,640
THANK YOU.

256
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,130
IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING WE DIDN'T GO.

257
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,500
I MEAN,THE WEDDING WASN'T CHEAP.

258
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,340
NOW WE'VE GOT NEW FURNITURE TO PAY FOR.

259
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,280
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET THOSE HOSPITAL BILLS,

260
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,310
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING WE DON'T HAVE INSURANCE.

261
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,340
OH,GOD! HALEY!

262
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,910
IT'S OKAY. YOU'RE SAFE. YOU'RE HOME NOW.

263
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,940
HEY,UM... BEFORE THE ACCIDENT,

264
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,840
THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT YOU WANTED TO TELL ME.

265
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:08,040
I GOT ACCEPTED TO STANFORD.

266
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,240
WELL,I'M HAPPY FOR YOU,HALES.

267
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,570
EVEN THOUGH WE JUST SPENT YOUR TUITION MONEY.

268
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,240
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

269
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:22,270
WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT AS LONG AS WE'RE TOGETHER.

270
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,420
HEY.

271
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,860
EVERYTHING OKAY?

272
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,990
YEAH,UH,NATHAN'S HOME,AND RACHEL'S AWAKE.

273
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,580
WE'RE JUST WAITING ON COOPER.

274
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,800
LOOKING FOR BROOKE?

275
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,630
SORT OF,YEAH.

276
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,100
I SAW HER AT THE HOSPITAL,

277
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,330
AND SHE SAID THAT SHE KIND OF WENT OFF ON YOU.

278
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,470
OH,YEAH.

279
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,060
SHE PRETTY MUCH TOLD ME TO GO BROOKE MYSELF.

280
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,040
I'M SORRY,PEYTON.

281
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,220
I MEAN,I DIDN'T THINK THAT KISS MEANT ANYTHING,

282
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,780
BUT,APPARENTLY TO BROOKE,IT MEANT EVERYTHING.

283
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,880
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ELSE,DID SHE,

284
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,420
ABOUT ME OR...US?

285
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,280
LIKE WHAT?

286
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,250
NOTHING.

287
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,120
IS THAT LETTER FROM HER?

288
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,780
ACTUALLY,NO.

289
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,780
YOU REMEMBER WHEN ELLIE CAME TO TOWN

290
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,200
AND TOLD ME SHE WAS MY BIRTH MOTHER?

291
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,710
IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN.

292
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,050
WAIT,YOU HAVE A THIRD MOTHER?

293
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,760
NO. NOT EXACTLY.

294
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:28,590
WH-- WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

295
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,620
FROM AN ALBUM SHE LEFT,ONE OF HER FAVORITES.

296
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,590
IF THIS IS TRUE --

297
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,920
YEAH.

298
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,120
APPARENTLY,I HAVE A BROTHER.

299
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,020
I'M SO SORRY.

300
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,050
I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE INEBRIATED.

301
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,050
SEVERAL WITNESSES SAY

302
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:06,420
YOU MADE A BIT OF A SCENE AT THE RECEPTION,

303
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,920
SAID YOU WERE PRETTY UPSET WITH HIM.

304
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,750
NOW,WHEN YOU'RE UP TO IT,

305
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,590
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO TAKE YOUR STATEMENT

306
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,490
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT BRIDGE.

307
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,290
I'M ESPECIALLY INTERESTED TO HEAR

308
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,450
HOW A PROFESSIONAL DRIVER

309
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:23,290
COULD JUST LOSE CONTROL OF A VEHICLE LIKE THAT.

310
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:29,290
I MEAN,I HAVE MY THEORY,BUT,FOR YOUR SAKE,

311
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,220
YOU BETTER HOPE HE WAKES UP AND TELLS ME THAT I'M WRONG.

312
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,340
SMELL THAT,FERGIE? HMM? IT SMELLS LIKE...

313
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,170
A BASKET BY SKILLS AND A VISIT BY LUCAS SCOTT --

314
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,470
BOTH RARE OCCURRENCES.

315
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,300
HEY,YO,MOUTH,STAY OFF THE CRACK PIPE,DAWG.

316
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,600
WHAT'S UP,BABY?

317
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,770
GOOD,BROTHER.

318
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,830
HOW'S NATE?

319
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,340
HE'LL BE OKAY.

320
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,030
WHAT ABOUT RACHEL?

321
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,580
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER YET?

322
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,240
I THINK SHE'LL BE OKAY.

323
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,340
NO WORD ON COOPER YET,THOUGH.

324
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,740
SO,LOOK,I GOT A FAVOR TO ASK YOU.

325
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,410
I WAS KIND OF THINKING ABOUT TRYING TO GO TO COLLEGE,

326
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,410
BUT MONEY KIND OF TIGHT RIGHT NOW.

327
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,410
ANYWAY,I KNOW YOU HAD TO LEAVE THE TEAM

328
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,580
BECAUSE OF YOUR HEART CONDITION AND ALL THAT,

329
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,910
BUT I WAS THINNG

330
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,510
MAYBE THE RAVENS COULD USE ANOTHER SHOOTING GUARD.

331
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,110
YOU WANT TO JOIN THE RAVENS?

332
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,780
IF IT'S GONNA GET ME A SCHOLARSHIP.

333
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,780
LOOK,I KNOW IT'S A LONG SHOT,BUT YOU NEVER KNOW.

334
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,110
THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY MAKE A RUN IN THE POSTSEASON,

335
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,940
AND SOMEBODY MIGHT ACTUALLY GET TO SEE ME PLAY.

336
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,240
YOU KNOW,A SMALL D2,JUCO,WHATEVER.

337
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,580
I JUST WONDERED IF YOU COULD TALK TO WHITEY FOR ME.

338
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,080
ABSOLUTELY.

339
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,420
LOOK,I JUST WANT A TRYOUT,DAWG.

340
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,090
I'M NOT ASKING FOR NO SPECIAL TREATMENT OR NOTHING.

341
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,420
I HEAR YOU,MAN. I WAS THERE. I'LL TALK TO WHITEY.

342
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,090
COOL. YOU'RE LOOKING OUT.

343
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,820
MAY I?

344
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,290
HOW'S NATHAN?

345
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,690
I DON'T KNOW,REALLY. YOU'D HAVE TO ASK MY EX-WIFE.

346
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,170
WHOSE FAULT IS THAT?

347
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,770
YEAH,FAIR ENOUGH.

348
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,300
AND COOPER?

349
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,800
COOPER WOULD BE BETTER OFF IF HE DIED IN HIS SLEEP.

350
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,280
EVERY TIME THAT IMMATURE PUNK COMES TO TOWN,

351
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,500
MY SON ENDS UP IN THE HOSPITAL.

352
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,590
HOPEFULLY,HE'LL BE OKAY.

353
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,900
KAREN,WOULD IT BE THE STRANGEST OF THINGS

354
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,600
IF WE GOT A CUP OF COFFEE SOMETIME?

355
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,930
I'VE GIVEN UP COFFEE THROUGH MY PREGNANCY.

356
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,130
A MOVIE THEN?

357
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,830
NO.

358
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,230
YOU'VE GIVEN UP MOVIES,TOO?

359
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,670
NO,I JUST DON'T WANT TO GO WITH YOU.

360
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:34,170
KAREN,I -- I JUST,UH...

361
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,670
I WANT TO BE THERE FOR YOU.

362
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,770
I KNOW I WASN'T THERE FOR YOU AND LUCAS.

363
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,630
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO RAISE ANOTHER CHILD ON YOUR OWN.

364
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,300
I DIDN'T RAISE LUCAS ALONE. I HAD KEITH.

365
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,030
THE CAR CRASHED  THROUGH THE GUARDRAIL...

366
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,100
HELLO?

367
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:09,170
I'M SORRY,NO COMMENT.

368
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,700
WHY DO ALL THE HARDEST DAYS SEEM TO LAST THE LONGEST?

369
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:22,130
IS IT POSSIBLE WE ONLY RENEWED OUR WEDDING VOWS THIS MORNING?

370
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,250
IT FEELS LIKE ANOTHER LIFE AGO.

371
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,180
IF IT WASN'T FOR NATHAN SCOTT,

372
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,020
THIS ACCIDENT  COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE.

373
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,640
HEY.

374
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,720
WHAT HAPPENED DOWN THERE AT THE RIVER?

375
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,020
CAN YOU TELL ME?

376
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,690
I DON'T KNOW.

377
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,020
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY,NATHAN.

378
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,520
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

379
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,720
I DON'T THINK SO,HALEY.

380
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,060
TODAY,FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME...

381
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,720
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE ANYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

382
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,120
CODE BLUE! CODE BLUE!

383
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,720
NATHAN,YOU'RE A HERO.

384
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,420
YOU DID EVERYTHING THAT YOU COULD.

385
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,960
CODE BLUE. CARDIAC ARREST.

386
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,890
PULSE RAPIDLY DEENDING.

387
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,590
DID I?

388
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,420
WE'RE LOSING HIM.

389
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,370
LET'S HAVE A HIGH DOSE OF EPI.

390
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,670
PREPARE TO DEFIBRILLATE.

391
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,170
CLEAR.

392
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,320
NO RESPONSE.

393
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,120
PUSH ONE OF ATROPINE. I'M GONNA HIT HIM AGAIN.

394
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,460
CLEAR.

395
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,390
B.P. -- 100 SYSTOLIC. PULSE OX RISING.

396
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,720
HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWAKE BY NOW.

397
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,250
THEY TOLD ME NATHAN SAVED MY LIFE.

398
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:56,650
HOW IS HE?

399
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,690
HOW IS HE?

400
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,320
HE'S DEVASTATED,RACHEL,AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

401
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,590
I SAW YOU IN THE LIMO WITH COOPER.

402
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,980
YOU WERE ARGUING WITH HIM.

403
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,110
IT WASN'T WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE.

404
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,030
?

405
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,470
YOU CAUSED A HUGE SCENE AT THE RECEPTION.

406
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,830
YOU STOLE THE LIMO.

407
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,900
AND NOW EVERYBODY'S LIFE IS WORSE BECAUSE OF YOU.

408
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:22,430
DOES IT EVEN MATTER TO YOU A LITTLE BIT?

409
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,870
ARE YOU GONNA CHANGE ONE SINGLE THING BECAUSE OF IT?

410
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,400
NATHAN DOESN'T NEED YOUR THANKS.

411
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,070
NEITHER DO I.

412
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,400
SO WHY DON'T YOU STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM US?

413
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,600
ALL OF US.

414
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,900
HEY,MOM?

415
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:48,630
IT WASN'T BROOKE. SHE'S NOT PREGNANT.

416
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,470
ARE YOU HAPPY ABOUT YOUR PREGNANCY?

417
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,130
WHY WOULD YOU ASK ME THAT?

418
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:02,630
WELL,WHEN ANDY PROPOSED TO YOU,

419
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,570
YOU SAID NO BECAUSE HE WANTED TO HAVE A FAMILY,

420
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,780
AND YOU DIDN'T WANT KIDS.

421
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,920
AND THAT'S FAIR,MOM.

422
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,270
YOU PUT YOUR LIFE ON HOLD FOR ME A LOT,BUT --

423
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,390
THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW.

424
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,570
THIS IS KEITH'S CHILD,TOO.

425
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,700
OKAY.

426
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,700
SO THEN WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF I TOLD YOU

427
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,490
THAT I WANTED TO STAY IN TREE HILL FOR COLLEGE?

428
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,970
HE DID A GOOD JOB WITH YOU,

429
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,800
BUT U.N.C. IS NOT THAT FAR AWAY.

430
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,810
AND I'LL BE FINE.

431
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:46,000
IT'S PRETTY COOL,THOUGH,HUH?

432
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:49,330
THAT YOU AND KEITH ARE HAVING A BABY.

433
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,670
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A PART OF HIM IS COMING BACK TUS.

434
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,230
HE DID A GOOD JOB WITH YOU.

435
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:06,030
OKAY,SO,MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

436
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,730
I BROUGHT YOU SOME MAKEUP AND THOSE SCISSORS YOU WANTED

437
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,440
?    A COUPLE OF OUTFITS,

438
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,010
WHICH REMINDS ME,CLOTHES OVER BRO'S SHOULD TOTALLY BE DESIGNING HOSPITAL GOWNS

439
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,490
'CAUSE I WOULD NOT BE CAUGHT DEAD IN THAT.

440
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,160
SORRY.

441
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,160
DO YOU THINK PEOPLE CAN CHANGE,BROOKE?

442
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,870
I MEAN...TRULY CHANGE?

443
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:37,200
WELL,I'D LIKE TO SAY YES,BUT,HONESTLY...

444
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,700
I DON'T REALLY THINK PEOPLE CAN CHANGE.

445
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,700
YOU KNOW,AT THE END OF THE DAY,YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE,

446
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,800
AND IT'S PROBABLY WHO YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN.

447
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,930
BUT WHAT IF WHO YOU'VE BEEN IS PRETTY HORRIBLE?

448
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,700
I BROUGHT YOU BACK YOUR HOUSE KEYS.

449
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,050
IT'S A VERY NICE HOUSE -- BIG ROOMS,NO PARENTS.

450
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,450
I USED TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE.

451
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,590
KEEP THEM.

452
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,120
I MEAN,YOU MOVED OUT OF PEYTON'S PLACE,RIGHT?

453
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,120
YOU MIGHT AS WELL CRASH AT MY HOUSE.

454
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,940
UNLESS YOU DON'T WANT TO.

455
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:23,820
SO,THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN HELL FREEZES OVER.

456
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,170
THANK YOU.

457
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,780
"SHE'S A RUNNER."

458
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,970
BILLY SQUIER.

459
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,520
AND I AM VERY IMPRESSED THAT YOU HAVE BILLY SQUIER ON YOUR iTUNES.

460
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,580
ACTUALLY,I THINK YOU GAVE THAT TO ME.

461
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,310
OKAY,UH... "THE RUNAWAY FOUND."

462
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,410
THE VEILS.

463
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,710
"RUNNING TO STAND --"

464
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,710
U2.

465
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,980
"STILL."

466
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,210
UH-HUH.

467
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,810
"RUNNING WITH THE --" VAN HALEN!

468
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,250
"DEVIL"!

469
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,940
YOU'RE GOOD.

470
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,270
MAN,WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME WE JUST HUNG OUT?

471
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:02,510
GOD,JUST THE TWO OF US? I DON'T KNOW.

472
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:05,820
PROBABLY THE DAY WE HID OUT IN THE LIBRARY AND I GOT SHOT IN THE LEG.

473
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,380
YEAH.

474
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,910
DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT MUCH?

475
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,130
EVERY DAY.

476
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,830
I WISH I COULD TAKE THAT DAY BACK FOR YOUR MOM AND KEITH.

477
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:20,590
AND I WISH I COULD TAKE BACK OUR KISS FOR YOU AND BROOKE.

478
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:28,990
"MOODY SUBURBAN TEENAGE LOVE SONG."

479
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,120
NICE TRY. SLOW RUNNER.

480
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:37,320
OKAY,SO THIS MAYBE BROTHER OF YOURS --

481
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,930
IT'S NOT ELLIE'S KID,RIGHT?

482
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,130
NO,HE IS THE SON OF THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER I HAVEN'T MET.

483
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,630
APPARENTLY,HIS NAME IS DEREK.

484
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,070
ARE YOU GONNA CALL HIM?

485
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,370
I DON'T KNOW.

486
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,430
I MEAN,IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ME.

487
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,930
YOU KNOW,IT'S HIS LIFE TO CONSIDER,TOO.

488
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,770
SO,I MEAN,MAYBE HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT ME,

489
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,570
AND MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT ME.

490
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,800
OR MAYBE HE FOUND A LETTER IN A LED ZEPPELIN ALBUM,

491
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,600
AND HE'S JUST A LITTLE TOO SCARED

492
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,270
TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND DIAL.

493
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,430
HEY.

494
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,310
WE WERE JUST --

495
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,170
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO MY BOYFRIEND...ALONE.

496
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:25,380
NICE JOB NOT HITTING ON HIM.

497
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,630
LUKE,I'LL GET THOSE CDs LATER.

498
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,800
THANKS FOR THE SEX.

499
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,160
SHE'S JOKING.

500
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,660
I WAS TRYING TO CALL YOU.

501
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,820
YOU MEAN,WHEN YOU WEREN'T HANGING OUT WITH PEYTON?

502
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,170
COME ON,BROOKE,YOU NEVER CALLED ME BACK.

503
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,500
NOW YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL.

504
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,050
LISTEN,I KNOW IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT FOR YOU LATELY,

505
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,890
LOSING KEITH AND YOUR HEART CONDITION AND GIVING UP BASKETBALL.

506
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:59,850
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN KEEPING YOU CLOSE TO ME

507
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,510
TO TRY TO PROTECT YOU FROM THOSE THINGS,

508
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:07,150
LIKE I'M HANGING ONTO THE TWO OF US FOR YOU,

509
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,950
BUT NOT FOR ME.

510
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:12,610
I'M SORRY I KISSED PEYTON.

511
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,550
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

512
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:21,080
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT,LUKE. IT'S NOT.

513
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:25,380
I MEAN,I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS,BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT HER.

514
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:28,650
THIS IS ABOUT ME.

515
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,210
I LOVE YOU,LUCAS.

516
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,600
AND I PROBABLY ALWAYS WILL.

517
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:41,100
BUT WE GO DAYS WITHOUT HAVING A MEANINGFUL CONVERSATION,

518
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:47,330
AND I USED TO MISS YOU SO MUCH WHEN THAT HAPPENED.

519
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:51,130
BUT IT NEVER SEEMED LIKE YOU MISSED ME.

520
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:56,630
AND I GUESS BECAUSE OF IT,I STOPPED MISSING YOU.

521
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:00,300
I MEAN,LOOK AT TODAY...

522
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,800
Lucas: I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE  SAID SOMETHING -- ANYTHING.

523
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,670
I MEAN,FOR A GUY  WHO WANTS TO BE A WRITER,

524
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,330
IT SUDDENLY SEEMED LIKE  NO WORDS HAD EVER BEEN WRITTEN.

525
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,320
BUT WHEN SOMEONE TELLS YOU

526
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,320
THAT THEY SOMEHOW  STOPPED MISSING YOU,

527
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,850
YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH SCREWED  NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY.

528
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,850
IT SHOULDN'T BE LIKE THIS,LUKE.

529
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,020
BROOKE --

530
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,290
I'M SORRY.

531
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,350
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

532
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:31,520
SEE,BUT THERE  HAD TO BE SOMETHING,RIGHT,

533
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:35,390
SOMETHING THAT  NO ONE HAD EVER SAID IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD,

534
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,490
SOMETHING  THAT COULD CHANGE THIS?

535
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,020
BROOKE.

536
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:47,620
I'M SORRY.

537
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,370
YEAH,ME TOO.

538
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,600
THAT WASN'T IT.

539
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,350
GOING SOMEWHERE?

540
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,630
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WANTED TO SEE ME.

541
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,410
I DIDN'T.

542
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,430
I REALLY SCREWED THIS UP,MOUTH.

543
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,200
I MEAN,WE WERE FIGHTING...

544
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,280
AND I GRABBED THE WHEEL.

545
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,920
I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.

546
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,350
YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM THIS,RACHEL.

547
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,290
HE COULD DIE,MOUTH.

548
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,630
YOU KNOW HOW YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA TELL EVERYONE

549
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,260
THAT YOU OPENED THE TIME CAPSULE,

550
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,260
AND I SAID NOT TO,THAT YOU SHOULD BURY IT?

551
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,090
I WAS WRONG.

552
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,460
AND UNTIL YOU FACE ALL THE MISTAKES YOU'VE MADE,

553
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:43,130
YOU'LL NEVER CHANGE.

554
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,890
PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE,MOUTH.

555
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,230
BUT THEY CAN.

556
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,460
THEY JUST DON'T BECAUSE IT'S EASIER NOT TO.

557
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:52,590
WE'RE ALWAYS WAITING FOR OUR LIVES TO BEGIN,LIKE,

558
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:55,160
FIGURING WE'LL BE SOMEONE ELSE SOMEDAY.

559
00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:00,660
BUT AFTER THIS ACCIDENT AND LOSING JIMMY AND KEITH,

560
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:04,330
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

561
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,830
ALL WE HAVE IS NOW,RACHEL.

562
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,290
DON'T RUN FROM THIS.

563
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:17,360
I AM ALL FOR LIVING LIFE TO THE FULLEST,

564
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:20,930
BUT CAN THIS DAY JUST BE OVER ALREADY?

565
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:28,360
HEY,MA,YOU LOVED DAN,RIGHT,IN HIGH SCHOOL?

566
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:31,360
ODDLY,YES.

567
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,860
OKAY,LOOK,I KNOW YOU PROBABLY CAN'T ANSWER THIS FOR ME,

568
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:39,560
BUT WHAT DID YOU DO WHEN HE DIDN'T LOVE YOU BACK?

569
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,890
HOW DID YOU GET OVER IT?

570
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:45,860
WHEN I DO,I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

571
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,860
"MY NAME IS LUCAS SCOTT.

572
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:03,690
"I'M A SENIOR  AT TREE HILL HIGH SCHOOL.

573
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:08,690
"I PLAY BASKETBALL.  AT LEAST,I USED TO.

574
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:14,230
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.  AT LEAST,I USED TO."

575
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,080
"AND I HAVE A BEST FRIEND."

576
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:23,150
...HAVE TO BE ALONE

577
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:29,080
YOUR HEAVY HEART

578
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,620
IS MADE OF STONE

579
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:48,880
IT'S SO HARD TO SEE YOU CLEARLY

580
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:56,650
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ON YOUR OWN

581
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:02,120
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ON YOUR OWN

582
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:12,280
AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT BACK

583
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:19,950
WELL,I'M NOT GONNA SAY I DON'T MEAN THAT

584
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,700
HEY,BROOKE.

585
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,940
HEY,UM,LOOK,I KNOW THAT IT'S REALLY LATE,

586
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,940
AND IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY,

587
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,160
BUT... I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

588
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,210
YEAH. COME ON IN.

589
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,470
MY SONG IS LOVE

590
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,740
THE FIRST THING I'D LIKE TO DO

591
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,140
IS TAKE ANOTHER PREGNANCY TEST,

592
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,180
JUST TO FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW FAR ALONG YOU ARE.

593
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,470
THEN WE CAN TALK MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHAT LIES AHEAD.

594
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,920
ok? ok

595
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,350
IS THIS YOUR FIRST CHILD?

596
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:57,290
NO,MY SECOND.

597
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:04,020
BUT I'M ON FIRE FOR YOU,CLEARLY

598
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:10,250
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ON YOUR OWN

599
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:21,790
AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT BACK

600
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:28,220
AND I'M NOT GONNA SAY I DON'T MEAN THAT

601
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:37,250
YOU'RE THE TARGET THAT I'M AIMING AT

602
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,540
BUT I'M NOTHING ON...

603
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,560
WELL,YOU'RE DEFINITELY PREGNANT.

604
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:51,060
GOT TO GET THAT MESSAGE HOME

605
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,560
"TREE HILL IS JUST A PLACE  SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD."

606
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:01,530
"MAYBE IT'S  A LOT LIKE YOUR WORLD.

607
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,590
MAYBE IT'S NOTHING LIKE IT."

608
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,890
"BUT IF YOU LOOK CLOSER,YOU  MIGHT SEE SOMEONE LIKE YOU...."

609
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:15,010
"...SOMEONE TRYING TO  FIND THEIR WAY..."

610
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:23,220
"...SOMEONE TRYING TO  FIND THEIR PLACE..."

611
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:28,330
"...SOMEONE TRYING TO  FIND THEIR SELF."

612
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:36,560
AND I'M NOT GONNA STAND AND WAIT

613
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,100
"SOMETIMES IT'S EASY TO FEEL

614
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:42,680
"LIKE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE  IN THE WORLD WHO'S STRUGGLING,

615
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,550
"WHO'S FRUSTRATED,

616
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:47,450
OR UNSATISFIED,OR BARELY GETTING BY."

617
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,330
Man: Hello?

618
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:56,840
BUT I'M NOTHING ON MY OWN

619
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,050
"THAT FEELING'S A LIE.

620
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,840
"AND IF YOU JUST HOLD ON,

621
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,520
"JUST FIND THE COURAGE  TO FACE IT ALL FOR ANOTHER DAY,

622
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,820
SOMEONE OR SOMETHING WILL  FIND YOU AND MAKE IT ALL OKAY."

623
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,860
"BECAUSE WE ALL NEED  A LITTLE HELP SOMETIMES..."

624
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,460
"...SOMEONE TO HELP US  HEAR THE MUSIC IN THE WORLD,

625
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:28,500
TO REMIND US THAT  IT WON'T ALWAYS BE THIS WAY."

626
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:32,560
"THAT SOMEONE IS OUT THERE."

627
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:37,390
"AND THAT SOMEONE  WILL FIND YOU."

628
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


629
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
