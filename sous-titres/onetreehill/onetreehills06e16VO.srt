1
00:00:00,007 --> 00:00:01,757
Previously on one tree hill...

2
00:00:01,767 --> 00:00:05,067
ain't nobody gonna
give no roster spot
to no fool
with no green elf shoes on.

3
00:00:06,934 --> 00:00:09,267
What are the chances of another
heart becoming available?

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,100
This time when it goes off,
call us.

5
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:13,400
I'm taking that last shot,
or i'm taking a seat.

6
00:00:13,434 --> 00:00:14,567
Take a seat.

7
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:17,801
Child services keeps showing up,
looking for me.

8
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:20,634
I probably won't see you
for a while.

9
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:23,000
I never had
a letterman jacket.
Now you do.

10
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:24,534
I want you to have this.

11
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:26,601
It means
we're going steady.

12
00:00:26,634 --> 00:00:29,434
I want a director who can
make the little things

13
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:31,133
the big things.

14
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:32,767
And you are just not the guy
to do that.

15
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:34,267
Pick one ...
if you don't,

16
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,200
i'm gonna choose
your director for you.

17
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:38,467
Appreciate you meeting me.

18
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:40,701
What do you want, reese?
I'm directing the movie.

19
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:43,300
It's done!

20
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:50,334
You can work your whole

21
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:53,567
"i'm nathan scott, mr. Big shot,
scoring my touchdowns"

22
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:55,667
on somebody else,
because ...
i don't even
play football.

23
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:58,000
Whatever ...  the point is,
at the end of the day,

24
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:00,667
all your bluster and b.s.
Don't mean anything to math,

25
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:04,200
because math don't care,
and neither do i.

26
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:05,534
Well, does english care?

27
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:07,200
'cause i pretty much
suck at that, too.

28
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,334
Thank you.

29
00:01:09,367 --> 00:01:11,400
Thank you for that.

30
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:12,834
I like her poncho.

31
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:14,334
Why am i shirtless?

32
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:16,467
Yeah, let's do one
where he wears a poncho

33
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:17,667
and she's shirtless.

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,868
He was kidding.
He was kidding.

35
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:25,767
You guys were great.
Thank you.

36
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,601
So,
what'd you guys think?

37
00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:31,234
Really?

38
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:33,267
Didn't realize julian had
given creative control
to all four of us.

39
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,434
They're the real people.

40
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:36,133
Don't you think their opinions
may be valuable?

41
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:39,634
They seemed fine.

42
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:40,767
Yeah.

43
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,100
I stand corrected.

44
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:44,234
Let's get the studio
on the phone right now.

45
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:46,367
Tell them we found two actors
who seem fine.

46
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,601
Why don't you tell them
their director's a jackass
while you're at it?

47
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:50,968
Okay, we should go,

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,200
and i will stop by later
to see how you're doing.

49
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:56,968
You know, even when
he talks back to me,

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,801
i still find him likable.

51
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:02,701
All right,
lose the shirt, buddy.

52
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:09,801
Always and forever.

53
00:02:11,734 --> 00:02:13,567
It sucks i can't
stick around for this.

54
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:16,501
It sucks even more you're
gonna be gone for two weeks.

55
00:02:16,534 --> 00:02:18,834
At least i'll have
all these shirtless nathans

56
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:20,234
to keep me company.

57
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:21,868
Oh, i don't think so.

58
00:02:26,734 --> 00:02:28,667
Thanks.

59
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:31,601
A crib.

60
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:33,534
Thank you, karen and andy.

61
00:02:42,634 --> 00:02:44,834
Thank you, karen and andy.

62
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:51,834
Were you allowed to date
in prison?

63
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:56,834
Some people did.
I opted not to. Why?

64
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:59,400
Well, there's a girl
at school ...

65
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:00,567
oh, you like her?
No.

66
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:01,634
Yes, you do.
No.

67
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:02,801
You like her a lot.

68
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:04,133
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

69
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:07,868
Anyway, i was wondering
if maybe i could invite her

70
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:09,467
over to your beach house
someday.

71
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:12,100
Sure. Why not today?
I'll clear it with your mom.

72
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:14,167
Well, i never asked a girl
over to play before.

73
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,534
What do i say?

74
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:16,968
Well, lucky for you,

75
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,267
women have never been able
to turn a scott man down.

76
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,200
So you just flash
your million-dollar smile,

77
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,734
say a few nice words,
and pfft ...

78
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:24,200
it's like putty
in your hands.

79
00:03:24,234 --> 00:03:26,467
Yeah, that's the one.

80
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:28,801
Just smile
and say something nice?

81
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,534
That really works?

82
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:32,701
Every time.

83
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:37,968
What are you smiling about?

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,067
I can't help it.
That was amazing.

85
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,968
No wonder you were so popular
in high school.

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,868
Excuse me?

87
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:47,367
Sex did not make me popular.
I made it popular.

88
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,167
Ohh. Well, either way,
i'm just happy

89
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,067
to be a part of that crowd
for a change.

90
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,601
Please.

91
00:03:52,634 --> 00:03:57,200
With this face,
you were probably mr. Popular.

92
00:03:57,234 --> 00:03:59,400
You might be surprised.

93
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:00,834
Anyway,
i wish i could stay,

94
00:04:00,868 --> 00:04:02,467
but i'm already late
for casting.

95
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:05,167
For which character?!

96
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,834
Don't ...  oh!

97
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:18,567
Peyton sawyer?
Yeah.

98
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:20,868
Go have a seat
with the other peytons,

99
00:04:20,901 --> 00:04:22,267
and we'll call you
when it's your turn.

100
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,100
Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry.
You don't understand.

101
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,901
I ...
i am peyton sawyer.

102
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:27,901
I really appreciate
your confidence,

103
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,000
but you still have to
wait your turn.

104
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:33,100
What's your name?

105
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:35,267
Peyton sawyer.

106
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,801
Actresses.

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,133
Why do people
always leave?

108
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:58,267
Hi. I'm here to read for
the part of peyton sawyer.

109
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:01,467
First of all,
you don't know me.

110
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,434
Second of all,
you don't know me.

111
00:05:04,467 --> 00:05:06,567
God, why are guys such jerks?

112
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:10,834
Too old, but she would
make a great deb.

113
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:14,434
Um,
she's the real peyton.

114
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:18,234
Hi.

115
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:19,467
Hi.

116
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:20,868
Did you come to watch?

117
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:22,234
No.

118
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:24,501
The baby-proofer's
coming to the house,

119
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:27,033
and i've got to go register
for our wedding and baby gifts,

120
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:28,601
and your mother
sent us a crib,

121
00:05:28,634 --> 00:05:30,133
but the instructions
are all in italian.

122
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:31,467
You're stewed, buttwad.

123
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,334
"Weird science."

124
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:38,501
I really wish i could help,
but i'm kind of slammed.

125
00:05:38,534 --> 00:05:39,968
No, it's okay.

126
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,501
I just came by to wish you good
luck and to bring you lunch.

127
00:05:42,534 --> 00:05:44,634
Why are you so good to me?
I don't know.

128
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:46,601
Maybe because
i am a riddle

129
00:05:46,634 --> 00:05:49,167
wrapped in a mystery
inside a bitch.

130
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,033
What woman isn't?

131
00:05:57,334 --> 00:05:58,400
Bye.

132
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
You wanted to see me?

133
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:06,067
Yes.
Take a seat, please.

134
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,200
Do you know
why i called you here?

135
00:06:11,234 --> 00:06:12,434
No.

136
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:14,968
I guess i'm in trouble,
but i don't know what for.

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,234
And i'm sure as hell not gonna
start admitting stuff.

138
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:20,033
I think you know
exactly what you did.

139
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:23,200
You won the essay contest,
and, as promised,

140
00:06:23,234 --> 00:06:26,367
you're gonna be published
in the school paper tomorrow.

141
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
You suck.

142
00:06:28,434 --> 00:06:30,801
Congratulations,
samantha.

143
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:34,100
Oh, you're gonna be
a published writer!

144
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:36,200
That is,
if that's okay with you.

145
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:37,634
Hell, yes.

146
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:39,467
She said yes!

147
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:41,567
That's great.
What time's she coming over?

148
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,767
I don't know.

149
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:44,534
What kind of food
does she like?

150
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:45,701
I don't know.

151
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:47,367
What do you know?
She said yes!

152
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,267
Well, that is
the most important thing.

153
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,968
Now, how do i get her
to like me?

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,234
Well,
if she's coming over,

155
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:53,767
she probably already
does like you.

156
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:56,234
Now all you have to do
is make sure you're dressed nice

157
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:57,767
and tell her
how good she looks.

158
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,634
Is that
how you got nanny deb?

159
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:01,400
That and gin.

160
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:02,834
Got any gin?

161
00:07:02,868 --> 00:07:06,300
Don't worry. I'll be there
the whole time if you need me.

162
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:10,767
* still i'm working now

163
00:07:10,801 --> 00:07:13,100
is that your heart again?

164
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,100
Yeah.

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,734
I'll be fine.

166
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:22,467
I wish that beeper
would beep already.

167
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:24,234
Me too, buddy.

168
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,701
Hey.

169
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:35,300
Lucas is casting his movie
in here today,

170
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:37,167
so the studio's
off-limits.

171
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Ohh. Sweet. Snow day.
Later, teach.

172
00:07:40,234 --> 00:07:42,834
Oh, no, no.
Not so fast.

173
00:07:42,868 --> 00:07:44,534
We still have work
to do.

174
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:46,200
You're kidding, right?

175
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:48,434
You're italian, right?

176
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:10,834
Easy, girl.

177
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:13,534
I saw that.
What?

178
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,100
Did you greet all
the other brookes that way?

179
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:18,133
No, ma'am. That i saved
just for you.
Oh.

180
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:20,133
And the guy playing whitey,
who is just so cute.

181
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,234
So, do you want to meet
brooke davis?

182
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:26,968
Shut up.
She's here?

183
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,734
Yeah.

184
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:30,467
I just got butterflies
a little bit.

185
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:32,000
Now i know
how people must feel

186
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,968
when they're meeting me
for the first time.

187
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,167
Missy, this is...

188
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,767
brooke davis!
Yep.
Brooke, this is...

189
00:08:40,801 --> 00:08:42,067
missy me!

190
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,100
Hi! Oh!

191
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:44,934
I guess we made
the right choice.

192
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:47,100
Oh, hi!
Oh!

193
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:48,934
Okay, i want my part
in the movie to be the best.

194
00:08:48,968 --> 00:08:50,734
So anything that you need,
you just ask.

195
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:52,501
Okay, great,
because i'm a method actor,

196
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:54,968
so i'm gonna need to know your
likes, dislikes, mannerisms ...

197
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,901
basically be glued to you
until the movie starts.

198
00:08:56,934 --> 00:08:58,334
What do you think?

199
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,901
Sounds...great.

200
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:02,133
Aah!
Ooh! Hi.

201
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:05,501
You wanted to see me,
coach?

202
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:07,501
I did.

203
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:12,801
I want to ask you something
in confidence.

204
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:15,200
What do you think
of devon?

205
00:09:15,234 --> 00:09:18,667
In confidence...

206
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:20,868
...i think he puts up
big numbers,

207
00:09:20,901 --> 00:09:22,701
but he won't win you
any games.

208
00:09:22,734 --> 00:09:24,734
He doesn't care
about the team.

209
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:26,901
He only cares about
getting himself to the nba.

210
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,734
And you don't want to
get to the nba?

211
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:30,100
No, i do.

212
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:32,868
But you're the only reason
i have a shot at it,

213
00:09:32,901 --> 00:09:35,601
so i owe you,
and i'm gonna play my heart out.

214
00:09:35,634 --> 00:09:37,133
Look...

215
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:39,767
if you started me, you'd be
replacing your star player

216
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:42,367
with a player that gives you
wins instead of headaches.

217
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,400
You sound like a salesman,
nate.

218
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:47,901
I believe
in what i'm selling.

219
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:51,234
So do i.

220
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:55,100
You're starting next game.
Be ready.

221
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,801
I want to draw something
that means something to someone.

222
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:06,667
You're always saving me, lucas.

223
00:10:06,701 --> 00:10:11,300
I love you, luke.
But i've chosen darkness.

224
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:13,300
That was great.
Thank you.

225
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:14,634
Thanks.

226
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,968
I loved "trouser hound,"
by the way.

227
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,133
He loves you, too.

228
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,901
Thanks.

229
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,167
There's something
about that one.

230
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,934
She wants to
sleep with you?

231
00:10:28,968 --> 00:10:30,601
There it is.
So, we done?

232
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:34,501
I liked the first girl.
I'm just not sure.

233
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:36,334
Two things ...
number one, big wedding ring.

234
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:38,634
Number two,
even bigger nose.

235
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:40,000
She can lose the ring,

236
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:41,968
but the schnoz
is gonna need its own trailer.

237
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,834
Okay, there's nothing wrong
with her nose.

238
00:10:43,868 --> 00:10:45,467
Besides, i'm not
casting this movie

239
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:47,033
based on
who i want to sleep with.

240
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:50,167
He has no idea
what he's doing.

241
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:52,968
It's called
having integrity.

242
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,534
It's called being naive.

243
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,334
Look, you have a decision
to make, okay?

244
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:58,300
Audiences like boobs.
I didn't make that up.

245
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:01,000
It's just ...  it's the way it is.
Sex sells.

246
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:03,968
So i say go with the girl
with the nice rack.

247
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,734
Now, if you want to disagree
with me, fine, go ahead.

248
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,734
But just make
a damn decision, man.

249
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:11,234
Adam, maybe you should
take a break.

250
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:14,534
You're right.
This place is dead anyway.

251
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:17,133
"Swingers."

252
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:20,300
Julian, i didn't get to choose
a director i like.

253
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:22,567
I'm not making the same mistake
with peyton.

254
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:24,267
Okay, that's fine.
But reese is right.

255
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,801
You need to come to a decision
you can both live with, okay?

256
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:28,767
Like it or not,
we have a deadline,

257
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:30,133
and you have a job to do.

258
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,367
This job sucks.

259
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,567
I don't think
this is right.

260
00:11:35,601 --> 00:11:39,701
It looks fine to me.
Done and done.

261
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:41,534
Okay, well, then,
what is that for?

262
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,534
I don't know ...
to keep the baby from moving?

263
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:46,334
Why don't you just
have lucas do it?

264
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:48,968
Because he's busy, and we are
two strong, capable women.

265
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We can do this.

266
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:52,367
Hey,
what's chase doing?

267
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,701
Uh, no.
He's busy...with me.

268
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:57,234
So, i'll see ya.

269
00:11:57,267 --> 00:11:59,801
I mean, arrivederci.

270
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,567
I got it when i was 12,
but i don't know why
you need to know.

271
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,534
How many cigarettes
do you smoke a day

272
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:11,033
to get your voice
to sound like this?

273
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:13,100
I don't smoke, and my voice
doesn't sound like that.

274
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,501
How many guys

275
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,033
did you sleep with
in high school?

276
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,701
Gee, i don't know.
I was never very good at math.

277
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:19,133
Dumb at math.
Got it.

278
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:21,400
What do you think
of this outfit?

279
00:12:21,434 --> 00:12:23,834
I don't think that brooke
would wear something like this.

280
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,701
I am brooke, and i did
wear something like that.

281
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:28,067
But don't you think it should be
a little more revealing

282
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,400
or easy to strip off at least ...
you know, brooke-ish?

283
00:12:31,434 --> 00:12:33,267
I don't strip things off.

284
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,367
The outfit is fine.
Julian, what do you think?

285
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,200
Um, it could be
a little sexier.

286
00:12:39,234 --> 00:12:42,567
Should i just go ahead
and put her in pasties?

287
00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:44,434
Come on, brooke. Did you really
wear that in high school?

288
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:46,234
Yes, i did.

289
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:47,767
Maybe during
your "clean teen" days.

290
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:53,701
Just make it a little sexier,
you know? Brooke-ish.

291
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:58,200
Oh, you totally have a type.
He looks a lot like lucas.

292
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,634
That's another thing you should
know about me for the movie.

293
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:06,567
I lash out sometimes.
Sorry.

294
00:13:06,601 --> 00:13:09,534
"Part of me is glad
that jack's gone.

295
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:13,200
"Gone is a place i dreamed of
when i was hiding in a closet

296
00:13:13,234 --> 00:13:16,133
"from whatever drunk parent
i had that month.

297
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:17,367
But ... "

298
00:13:19,234 --> 00:13:21,100
whose phone is that?

299
00:13:24,033 --> 00:13:25,868
Yours.

300
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:32,667
Hi.
Is everything okay?

301
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:35,901
Hey. I just wanted you to be
the first to know.

302
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:37,634
I'm starting next game.

303
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,167
I couldn't have done this
without you, hales.

304
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,634
I love you.

305
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:44,267
Tell jamie i'll
call him later, okay?

306
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,100
I love you, too.

307
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:48,467
He's ...  he's starting!

308
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,667
Sorry, sam.

309
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:01,133
"But i got lucky."

310
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:07,701
You must be
lauren's mom.

311
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:10,200
You must not talk
to many women.

312
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:12,167
I'm lauren,
jamie's teacher.

313
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,834
He invited me to his grandpa's
house after school,

314
00:14:14,868 --> 00:14:16,634
and i just couldn't turn down
an afternoon

315
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,367
with a cute boy
and a little old man.

316
00:14:19,868 --> 00:14:21,868
You're not
a little old man.

317
00:14:21,901 --> 00:14:23,367
No.

318
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:27,434
Grandpa dan, aren't you
gonna invite her in?

319
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,367
You look very nice,
miss lauren.

320
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,334
Thank you. It's what i was
wearing at school earlier.

321
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:35,601
Well, it's very becoming.
Shall we?

322
00:14:35,634 --> 00:14:38,067
Thank you.

323
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,434
So, what did you do?

324
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:49,701
Nothing. The principal
just wanted to meet with me.

325
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:51,434
You're probably
in trouble.

326
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,667
With the new princal,
everyone's in trouble.

327
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:03,367
Mrs. Scott,
could you come in, please?

328
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:10,534
Am i in trouble,
principal rimkus?

329
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:17,300
Do you know why
i wanted to see you?

330
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:18,367
No.

331
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,033
And i'm not gonna start
admitting stuff.

332
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:27,200
I have a problem
with the essay

333
00:15:27,234 --> 00:15:28,901
you selected
for the school paper.

334
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:30,701
Oh, sam's essay?
What's wrong with it?

335
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:33,968
What, you mean besides all the
references to sex and drugs?

336
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,467
She's witnessed some really
horrible things growing up.

337
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:38,734
I think that's what makes
the essay so important.

338
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:40,868
Well, that may be.

339
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:43,601
But i have the students and
their parents to worry about.

340
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:47,067
I understand,
but with all due respect,

341
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,067
i thought i was in charge
of the school paper

342
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,033
and had final say
on what went in it.

343
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:52,567
You do.

344
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:55,434
And i have final say
on whether or not you work here.

345
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:58,968
Pick another essay.

346
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,201
So, when you stop
to think about it,

347
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:07,434
where does
the sidewalk end?

348
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,700
You know, i never really
thought about it.

349
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:11,634
Jamie's always been advanced
for his age.

350
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:13,800
Right now he's reading
the "time traveler's wife."

351
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,568
Oh, that's one
of my favorite books.
Mine too.

352
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,234
That's great.

353
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:20,467
How about i refill
your kool-aid?

354
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:23,000
Well, thank you, jamie.
That is very gentlemanly of you.

355
00:16:23,034 --> 00:16:25,067
We have wine,
if you prefer.

356
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,601
Kool-aid will be fine.

357
00:16:27,634 --> 00:16:29,134
Back off.

358
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,700
Hey, skills.
You looking for luke?

359
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:37,833
No.
I'm the baby-proofer.

360
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:39,700
Why didn't i know that?

361
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:41,767
Who brags about being
a baby-proofer?

362
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,067
Oh, okay.

363
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,100
I mean, i think our house
is pretty safe.

364
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:48,934
I can spot at least
20 pbis already.

365
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,767
Huh?

366
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,467
Possible baby injuries.

367
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:53,601
Oh. Like what?

368
00:16:53,634 --> 00:16:55,568
Well, for one,
lamp cord strangles.

369
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:57,334
Okay.
Outlets electrocute.

370
00:16:57,367 --> 00:17:00,167
And i'm guessing you
probably don't have a
lock on the toilet seat.

371
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:02,467
Luke barely remembers
to put it down.

372
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:05,401
Funny. But you know
what's not so funny?

373
00:17:05,434 --> 00:17:08,367
When junk was a kid,
he fell in a toilet ...

374
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:10,301
almost drowned.

375
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:12,067
He was dead
for 40 seconds.

376
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,067
I'm ...  no, i'm sorry.
You're right.

377
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,434
That's totally not funny.

378
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:21,167
Um, i have a lot of work
to do, huh?

379
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:22,367
Yep.

380
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:24,267
But you got lucas
to help you, right?

381
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:26,668
No, i mean, he's over at tric
casting his movie.

382
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,668
But i ha...  i have it.
It's fine.

383
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,034
That's not done,
by the way.

384
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:35,234
I hope not.

385
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:38,767
I can see at least 30 pbis
already.

386
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,867
If you need help putting
that thing back together,

387
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,334
give me a call.

388
00:17:52,367 --> 00:17:54,367
I'm also a handyman.

389
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:09,100
Hey. Heard any word
from jack yet?

390
00:18:09,134 --> 00:18:12,401
Uh...no.

391
00:18:12,434 --> 00:18:15,201
That's kind of
why i hang here.

392
00:18:15,234 --> 00:18:16,833
I figure this
is where he'll show

393
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:18,401
when he decides
to come back...

394
00:18:18,434 --> 00:18:19,601
if he decides to.

395
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:21,367
I'm sure he will.

396
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:23,668
Yeah. I hope so.

397
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:30,367
Could you really get fired
for publishing my paper?

398
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,034
Where did you hear that?

399
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:33,434
I've already lost jack.

400
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:36,534
I really don't want to lose you
to some stupid paper.

401
00:18:36,568 --> 00:18:40,034
You ...
you're not gonna lose me.

402
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:42,501
And your paper's anything
but stupid, sam.

403
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,634
Well, i better get going.
Don't want brooke to worry.

404
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,267
Listen, haley.

405
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:55,534
I appreciate it.
I do.

406
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:58,934
But if i were you, i would just
choose a different paper.

407
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:01,267
It's not worth it.

408
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:20,634
Looks like 12's
the new 23.

409
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,700
What's up?

410
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:31,767
Like you don't know.

411
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,700
Coach cut his best player
to start his best friend.

412
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:37,467
I didn't know
he was cutting you.

413
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:40,167
I thought ...

414
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:41,867
i'm sorry.

415
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,601
Don't be.

416
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:48,601
I'm going to the nba anyway.
Somehow ...

417
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:50,668
daddy!

418
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:55,134
Hey, boo.
There's my team.

419
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:57,334
Hey. Hi.

420
00:19:57,367 --> 00:20:00,800
Hey,
daddy's gonna be okay.

421
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,100
What you looking at,
12?

422
00:20:03,134 --> 00:20:06,000
You're not the only one
with a family.

423
00:20:14,301 --> 00:20:18,134
Wedding. Wedding.
Wedding.

424
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:21,134
Baby.

425
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:23,167
Is there a reason
that we're registering

426
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:25,467
for the wedding and the baby
at the same time?

427
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:27,334
Well, they're happening
at the same time,

428
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:28,967
so why not
register them together?

429
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,467
Because i may have registered
the baby for a boning knife.

430
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:34,501
That's got to be a pbi,
right?

431
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,800
I swear, i love you,
but are you sure

432
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,867
you would not rather
be doing this with lucas?

433
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,201
No. He is busy.

434
00:20:41,234 --> 00:20:43,601
And there is no one
i would rather do this with

435
00:20:43,634 --> 00:20:45,767
than my best friend
and my maid of honor.

436
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,167
Maid of honor?
Really?!

437
00:20:48,201 --> 00:20:50,568
Well, it shouldn't be
a surprise.

438
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:52,601
But it's so nice to hear!

439
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:54,334
Okay!
Ohh.

440
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:55,967
Want to know
what i think?

441
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,833
I think that nathan
likes tutor girl,

442
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:59,601
but tutor girl likes lucas,
and i know i like lucas,

443
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:01,534
and i don't know who
the hell you like anymore.

444
00:21:01,568 --> 00:21:04,401
This is all turning into one big
love rectangle plus one,

445
00:21:04,434 --> 00:21:05,700
whatever that is.

446
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:08,434
Pretty good, right?
Yeah. Awesome.

447
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,000
Dude,
she sounds like you.

448
00:21:11,034 --> 00:21:12,501
I was never
that anning.

449
00:21:12,534 --> 00:21:13,700
I know how you feel.

450
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:15,067
I was in tric
earlier today,

451
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,301
and there were 10 peyton sawyers
bitching and moaning.

452
00:21:17,334 --> 00:21:19,334
Oh, so there were 11 of you
bitching and moaning?

453
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:21,501
I think i like
that other one better.

454
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:25,767
So, i'm driving jamie home
from school,

455
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,668
and he suddenly yells at me
to stop the car

456
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,267
because orval got out
of the bag.

457
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:30,700
Oh, and who's orval?

458
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:32,034
My question exactly.

459
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:34,034
Orval is his pet rabbit's
imaginary friend.

460
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:35,833
Oh, that's so cute.

461
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:38,301
And he insists that orval
has gone into a chuck e. Cheese.

462
00:21:38,334 --> 00:21:40,534
So, since we're already there,
why not grab some pizza?

463
00:21:40,568 --> 00:21:42,833
Oh, he's crafty.

464
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:44,700
You're making fun of me?

465
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:46,167
No, i wasn't.

466
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:47,434
You're trying
to embarrass me

467
00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:48,900
so miss lauren
will like you better.

468
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,067
Jamie.

469
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,267
He was in prison!

470
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:03,900
Hey, yo, man.
I heard you was casting today.

471
00:22:03,934 --> 00:22:06,167
Hey,
who's gonna play fergie?

472
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:08,967
Uh, man, uh...

473
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,700
you know, when i turned
the book into a movie,

474
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:14,867
i had to omit
some of the characters.

475
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,301
Look, i'm really sorry, fergie.
I didn't...

476
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:19,934
then who did luke hang with
on the river court?

477
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:23,367
Mouth...and skills.

478
00:22:23,401 --> 00:22:25,700
You gonna play me
like that?

479
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:27,534
That's cold, dawg.

480
00:22:27,568 --> 00:22:29,401
Look, fergie...

481
00:22:29,434 --> 00:22:31,700
which do you like better?

482
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:33,134
They look the same,
man.

483
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:35,134
We're gonna need you to sign off
on a few locations

484
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:36,668
before we can move on.
Okay...

485
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,234
hey, man, i am trying to wrap my
head around this dan character.

486
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:41,367
I don't get why he's got
all this hatred for keith.

487
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,234
Reese wants to sign off
on peyton number three.

488
00:22:43,267 --> 00:22:44,401
Are you okay with that?

489
00:22:44,434 --> 00:22:45,767
No!
I like the first one.

490
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,434
Toucan sam?
Peyton's a love interest.

491
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,301
Think about it
with your other head.

492
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:51,067
I know you have a vision,
lucas,

493
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,934
but maybe you need to trust
reese's experience on this one.

494
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:55,568
Our table read is tomorrow,
and we can't do it
without a peyton.

495
00:22:55,601 --> 00:22:57,267
I know, all right!
I just need to think about it!

496
00:22:57,301 --> 00:22:58,900
We don't have time
for that.

497
00:22:58,934 --> 00:23:01,601
Well, make...time!

498
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,134
And...scene.

499
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,467
So, which ones do you think
lucas will like?

500
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:18,334
Whichever ones
you're naked in.

501
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:21,434
Speaking of naked...

502
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:24,000
i slept with julian.

503
00:23:24,034 --> 00:23:25,900
Come again?

504
00:23:25,934 --> 00:23:27,467
That's what she said.

505
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:29,867
She being me ...
it's a joke.

506
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,867
I know.
I get it.

507
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,467
Um, god, why am i just
finding out about this now?

508
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:37,967
'cause i've been really scared
to tell you.

509
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,867
I know that you said
it's fine,

510
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,167
but i kind of still feel like
it violates girl code somehow,

511
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:45,833
and i know you're happy
and engaged

512
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:49,100
and pregnant, and ...
and he's charming.

513
00:23:49,134 --> 00:23:52,501
Brooke, hey, really...
it's fine.

514
00:23:52,534 --> 00:23:54,501
We talked about this,
all right?

515
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:56,601
Girl code was shattered
years ago.

516
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:58,267
You promise?

517
00:23:58,301 --> 00:24:00,134
You're not gonna revoke
my maid-of-honor card?

518
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:02,134
God.
Of course i promise.

519
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:03,367
Come here.

520
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:08,733
I mean, you know that's like
three guys we've shared, right?

521
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:11,234
Lucas, julian.

522
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:13,367
Um, sex tape?

523
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:15,568
Ew. Sex tape.

524
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:18,367
I forgot about that, and i
kind of wish that you had, too.

525
00:24:18,401 --> 00:24:19,800
Oh, no, no, no.

526
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:24,301
Um, so just how did it go
from being a non-date to sex?

527
00:24:24,334 --> 00:24:26,234
It was the grin, right?

528
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:27,833
That didn't hurt.

529
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:31,700
And then he threw in a touch
of sweet and so much sincerity.

530
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:33,867
And then he threw in
the letterman jacket i made him.

531
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,967
Oh, well, letterman jacket.
That's a good touch.

532
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
High-school brooke
did letter in sex.

533
00:24:46,034 --> 00:24:47,568
Hey,
how's the movie biz?

534
00:24:47,601 --> 00:24:49,401
Well, i had
my first diva moment ...

535
00:24:49,434 --> 00:24:50,867
threw a temper tantrum.

536
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,733
No way. Damn. Wish i'd
have been here to see it.

537
00:24:53,767 --> 00:24:55,833
Uh, stick around.
I'm sure i'll have another.

538
00:24:55,867 --> 00:24:57,934
Is it really that bad?

539
00:24:57,967 --> 00:24:59,934
I can't even pick a basketball
much less a peyton

540
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:02,000
without feeling like i'm making
the wrong decision.

541
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:04,601
My gut says one thing,
and everybody else
says something else.

542
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:06,601
Who cares what
everybody else says?

543
00:25:06,634 --> 00:25:08,301
Go with your gut.

544
00:25:08,334 --> 00:25:09,900
Just like that, huh?

545
00:25:09,934 --> 00:25:11,733
Lucas, this was your book,
and now it's your movie.

546
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:14,067
You know the characters,
and you know tree hill
better than anybody.

547
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,067
You should have some faith in
yourself, for crying out loud.

548
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,767
I love you. I love you.
You know that?
I know.

549
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,201
You know, they should name
an antidepressant after you.

550
00:25:20,234 --> 00:25:22,601
Yeah. Great with
everybody else's problems.

551
00:25:22,634 --> 00:25:24,601
It's my own
i'm a basket case with.

552
00:25:24,634 --> 00:25:27,267
Hmm. All right, well...
psychotherapist luke.

553
00:25:27,301 --> 00:25:29,134
Can i help you
with anything?

554
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:31,467
Sam wrote this paper
for my class.

555
00:25:31,501 --> 00:25:34,767
It was gritty and harsh
and honest and really beautiful,

556
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,501
and i want to publish it
in the school paper.

557
00:25:37,534 --> 00:25:39,700
And principal rimkus
won't let me.

558
00:25:39,733 --> 00:25:42,733
Well,
what else can you do?

559
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:44,900
I could publish it anyway.

560
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:46,668
Kids like sam, they ...

561
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,267
sometimes all they have
is a voice,

562
00:25:48,301 --> 00:25:49,934
and if you take that away
from them,

563
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:52,167
especially after everything
that she's been through,

564
00:25:52,201 --> 00:25:55,067
then what's the point of
me even calling myself
a teacher anymore?

565
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,434
Well, it sounds to me

566
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:58,434
like you've already
made your decision.

567
00:25:58,467 --> 00:26:00,100
I'm just not sure
it's the right one.

568
00:26:00,134 --> 00:26:02,700
Man, you got to have some faith
in yourself sometimes.

569
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:04,301
No, go with your gut.
Come on.

570
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:06,100
What's the worst
that can happen?

571
00:26:06,134 --> 00:26:08,234
I could get fired,
or at least suspended.

572
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:10,800
I've been suspended ...
not that bad.

573
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:15,234
You're pretty good
at cheering me up, too.

574
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,167
Yes!

575
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:23,733
Go away!
You're mean!

576
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:26,267
That's why daddy and uncle lucas
don't like you.

577
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:31,067
That's true.

578
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:36,267
I was mean.

579
00:26:36,301 --> 00:26:38,434
And they have every reason
not to like me.

580
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:40,000
But ever since i got sick,

581
00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:42,467
i've tried real hard
to be a better person.

582
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,501
Then why were you
making fun of me?

583
00:26:44,534 --> 00:26:46,201
I would never
make fun of you.

584
00:26:46,234 --> 00:26:50,401
You're my best friend.
Don't you know that?

585
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:52,568
Actually,
you're my only friend.

586
00:26:52,601 --> 00:26:54,634
I don't even have
an imaginary one.

587
00:26:54,668 --> 00:26:57,234
Miss lauren doesn't think
i'm a joke?

588
00:26:57,267 --> 00:26:59,867
Of course not.
You're her favorite student.

589
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,501
She told me this is one of the
best dates she's ever been on.

590
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:04,234
She said that?

591
00:27:04,267 --> 00:27:06,401
She sure did.

592
00:27:06,434 --> 00:27:08,434
You should go back in there
and finish the date.

593
00:27:10,568 --> 00:27:13,034
And if i hurt your feelings,
i'm sorry.

594
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:15,568
I would never do anything
to hurt my best friend.

595
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:18,634
I forgive you.

596
00:27:21,501 --> 00:27:23,934
Well,
aren't you coming?

597
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:26,301
You'll be fine
without me.

598
00:27:43,733 --> 00:27:46,100
I just wanted to make sure
i got your signature move right.

599
00:27:46,134 --> 00:27:47,867
What is with you idiots?

600
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,534
This is not
my signature move.

601
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,634
And fyi, i did a lot more
in high school

602
00:27:52,668 --> 00:27:54,067
than just have sex,
okay?

603
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,367
I was
student-body president.

604
00:27:55,401 --> 00:27:57,267
I was the captain
of the cheerleading squad.

605
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:58,467
I started
a clothing line.

606
00:27:58,501 --> 00:28:00,267
It is amazing that i even
had time for sex!

607
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:02,167
Sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.

608
00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:04,100
I was just following
the breakdown.

609
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:09,700
"Brooke davis ...
gorgeous brunette

610
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:11,900
"with an amazing energy
and smile.

611
00:28:11,934 --> 00:28:15,167
"Her three
favorite things ...

612
00:28:15,201 --> 00:28:18,167
sex, sex, and sex."

613
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:24,967
Coach...i wanted to talk
to you about devon.

614
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,634
I didn't mean for you
to cut him.

615
00:28:27,668 --> 00:28:29,601
Well, good,
because it wasn't your call.

616
00:28:29,634 --> 00:28:31,634
I cut devon because
he wouldn't play for me.

617
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,900
And that crap he pulled
the other night ...

618
00:28:33,934 --> 00:28:35,267
that's the last straw.

619
00:28:35,301 --> 00:28:38,234
Okay, well, maybe you could talk
to him about it or something.

620
00:28:38,267 --> 00:28:40,167
Coach,
the guy has a family.

621
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:41,668
So do you, nathan.
So do i.

622
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,267
Look,
this is a business.

623
00:28:43,301 --> 00:28:46,301
You two aren't the only ones
whose end game is the nba.

624
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:48,601
I'm certainly not gonna get
there coaching a losing team.

625
00:28:48,634 --> 00:28:51,034
I understand. Okay, maybe
devon and i can work together.

626
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:53,167
It's done, nathan.

627
00:28:53,201 --> 00:28:56,034
You're my starter now.
I need for you to focus on that.

628
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:59,134
Who's more important here ...
you or devon?

629
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:03,134
My family
is more important.

630
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:05,833
All right, then.
We're done here.

631
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:08,900
I'll see you in practice
tomorrow.

632
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:21,568
Stop it!

633
00:29:23,034 --> 00:29:24,634
He already cast me.

634
00:29:24,668 --> 00:29:26,301
Hey!

635
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:28,634
Excuse me.

636
00:29:28,668 --> 00:29:30,668
It's like "the twilight zone"
in here!

637
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,100
You!

638
00:29:32,134 --> 00:29:34,833
How could you write such
horrible things about me?

639
00:29:34,867 --> 00:29:37,201
You, who called me
your pretty girl

640
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,301
and said that i was gonna
change the world someday?!

641
00:29:39,334 --> 00:29:41,000
Huh?!
What are you
talking about?

642
00:29:41,034 --> 00:29:43,367
Tell me that you
didn't write that!

643
00:29:43,401 --> 00:29:45,334
I didn't write this.

644
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,568
Then who did?

645
00:29:47,601 --> 00:29:49,401
I'll take
the third haley's legs,

646
00:29:49,434 --> 00:29:53,201
the first brooke's fun bags,
and the last peyton's ass.

647
00:29:56,234 --> 00:29:58,934
I take
the real brooke davis.

648
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:03,301
Here's your stupid jacket.
I should have seen this coming.

649
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,467
You related to my character
in the book,

650
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:07,401
and you wanted
all my wardrobe to be sexier,

651
00:30:07,434 --> 00:30:09,167
and you gave me
your letterman jacket.

652
00:30:09,201 --> 00:30:11,568
You want high-school brooke?
I have news for you.

653
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,601
I am not that girl anymore.

654
00:30:13,634 --> 00:30:15,833
There is a lot more to me
than just sex.

655
00:30:15,867 --> 00:30:18,201
Brooke ...
high-school brooke
graduated!

656
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:19,733
Hey, brooke!

657
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:23,800
Don't worry.

658
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:26,634
I know where you can find five
more who look just like her.

659
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:40,768
Oh, hey. You're baby-proofing.
Don't forget the laundry room.

660
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:42,701
Jamie used to take naps
in the dryer.

661
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:43,933
Yeah, i got it.

662
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:47,868
The toilet,
the cupboards, fridge.

663
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,868
What else does a baby
get into?

664
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,067
Your heart.

665
00:30:57,801 --> 00:30:59,200
I love it.

666
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:00,701
Good.
Thanks.

667
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,000
I saw you registered
for a boning knife,

668
00:31:03,033 --> 00:31:05,868
but i figured that was
more practical for a newborn.

669
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,300
How you holding up?

670
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:11,501
I don't know.

671
00:31:11,534 --> 00:31:13,167
One minute,
i'm shopping,

672
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,567
and the next,
i feel like i'm gonna cry.

673
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:17,100
Tell me that's normal.

674
00:31:17,134 --> 00:31:19,900
Just remember, things are never
as bad as you think they are,

675
00:31:19,933 --> 00:31:22,067
even though your hormones
are trying to convince
you otherwise.

676
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,933
I know, i know.

677
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:27,300
Um, i just ...  i keep telling
everybody that i'm okay.

678
00:31:27,334 --> 00:31:29,401
But doing
all this baby stuff

679
00:31:29,434 --> 00:31:31,768
just really makes me wish
that lucas was here.

680
00:31:31,801 --> 00:31:33,834
I've got this
doctor's appointment tomorrow

681
00:31:33,868 --> 00:31:35,434
that i really
want him to go to,

682
00:31:35,467 --> 00:31:37,401
but he's so busy
with the movie.

683
00:31:37,434 --> 00:31:39,634
Well, if you want him to go,
why don't you just tell him?

684
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:41,933
I did.
I told him last week.

685
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:43,933
But with everything
that's going on, he's ...

686
00:31:43,967 --> 00:31:45,701
you know, he's swamped,

687
00:31:45,734 --> 00:31:48,100
and i don't
want to be a nag.

688
00:31:48,134 --> 00:31:49,801
I think you should
nag him anyway.

689
00:31:49,834 --> 00:31:52,334
That boy needs it.

690
00:31:52,367 --> 00:31:53,734
Thanks.

691
00:31:53,768 --> 00:31:55,768
And thanks for being
so good with luke.

692
00:31:55,801 --> 00:31:58,667
You make everything better
for us.

693
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:03,734
Sorry i'm late.
I'll start dinner.

694
00:32:03,768 --> 00:32:05,634
Or we can order pizza.

695
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:08,100
Sam, i am not
in high school anymore.

696
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,334
I can make you
a grown-up dinner,

697
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:15,200
like a salad
or a...roast.

698
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:18,200
Okay, i was just thinking
maybe we could celebrate?

699
00:32:18,234 --> 00:32:21,134
Okay.
What should we celebrate?

700
00:32:21,167 --> 00:32:23,234
The fact that i finally
ditched my clone

701
00:32:23,267 --> 00:32:25,933
or that julian thinks that
i am a teenage nymphomaniac?

702
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:29,334
Um, i was just kind of thinking
maybe we could celebrate

703
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:31,667
me winning
the school essay contest.

704
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,234
Really?

705
00:32:37,267 --> 00:32:40,834
Sam, that's amazing.

706
00:32:40,868 --> 00:32:43,134
"Homeless in high school."

707
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:45,534
It's about me and jack ...

708
00:32:45,567 --> 00:32:48,134
how rough life can be
on your own.

709
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,933
All that fun stuff.

710
00:32:52,234 --> 00:32:54,834
I am so proud of you.

711
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,567
Thank you.

712
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,234
Can i put it
on the fridge?

713
00:33:01,267 --> 00:33:02,734
Yeah.

714
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:05,933
Brooke...

715
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:08,834
i don't know why
you're so mad at julian,

716
00:33:08,868 --> 00:33:11,100
but at least
he's still around.

717
00:33:11,134 --> 00:33:13,534
I would give anything
to have jack back.

718
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:15,100
Yeah.

719
00:33:15,134 --> 00:33:17,801
But we should be
celebrating that.

720
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:20,234
So, what do you
want to do?

721
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:22,501
I want to eat pizza.

722
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:25,634
Seriously?

723
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:27,933
Okay.

724
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:30,367
So thanks for tonight, jamie.
I'll see you in school tomorrow?

725
00:33:30,401 --> 00:33:31,701
Bye.

726
00:33:49,434 --> 00:33:52,367
So, how did the rest
of your evening go?

727
00:33:52,401 --> 00:33:53,634
So-so.

728
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:55,567
She just wanted to talk
about adult stuff

729
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:58,033
like a new car
and maroon 5.

730
00:33:58,067 --> 00:34:00,933
Next time, i think i should date
someone my own age.

731
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:04,067
Or younger.

732
00:34:06,134 --> 00:34:08,067
I'm sorry
i called you mean.

733
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,634
Next time, we should
just do a guys' night.

734
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:14,834
So, uh...
we still friends?

735
00:34:14,868 --> 00:34:16,801
Best.

736
00:34:20,634 --> 00:34:22,701
Hey, it's me.

737
00:34:22,734 --> 00:34:25,267
Um, god, i'm sorry.
I know you're busy.

738
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,267
Just today has been...

739
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,300
i tried
putting the crib together.

740
00:34:31,334 --> 00:34:32,967
I did.
It just totally sucked.

741
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,100
And every square inch
of our house

742
00:34:35,134 --> 00:34:36,534
needs to be baby-proofed,

743
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:38,801
or our kid's gonna end up
like junk.

744
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:42,067
And i don't even know
what we're registered for.

745
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,501
I really just wish
you could have been there.

746
00:34:44,534 --> 00:34:46,367
Um, and i wish
you could be there

747
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:48,434
for my doctor's appointment
tomorrow,

748
00:34:48,467 --> 00:34:50,467
but i know you're busy,
and i just ...

749
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:54,701
if you're satisfied
with your message, press 1.

750
00:34:54,734 --> 00:34:57,933
If you would like to erase and
re-record your message, press 2.

751
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:03,067
Hi! It's me.

752
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,801
Um, i put the crib together.
It's awesome.

753
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,334
So, i just want to call
and say hi and i miss you

754
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:10,267
and come home soon, okay?

755
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,900
Bye.

756
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:24,534
You want to know
what i think?

757
00:35:24,567 --> 00:35:26,467
I know what you think.

758
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:28,534
You want the girl
with the big breasts.

759
00:35:29,634 --> 00:35:32,200
Look, when i was casting
"trouser hound,"

760
00:35:32,234 --> 00:35:33,768
i had a really tough time

761
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:36,768
trying to decide
who should play miss kittington.

762
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,667
A director friend of mine
told me to close my eyes
during the auditions.

763
00:35:39,701 --> 00:35:41,300
He said
that was the best way

764
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:44,267
to be able to hear the actress
and not just see a hot girl.

765
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,100
Is that what you do?
No!

766
00:35:46,134 --> 00:35:48,000
I picked the actress
with the best rack.

767
00:35:48,033 --> 00:35:50,033
You just looked like
you needed some advice.

768
00:35:51,634 --> 00:35:53,100
Hi.

769
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:54,834
Well, hello.

770
00:35:54,868 --> 00:35:56,367
Leave us.

771
00:35:56,401 --> 00:36:00,167
Actually, i want to
speak to both of you.

772
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,900
I really
want to play peyton.

773
00:36:02,933 --> 00:36:05,567
I feel that i identify
with her.

774
00:36:05,601 --> 00:36:07,834
We were both in
the popular crowd in school

775
00:36:07,868 --> 00:36:10,534
even though we felt
like outcasts,

776
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:14,167
and we both feel that the first
song you hear in the morning

777
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,033
can affect
your entire day.

778
00:36:18,067 --> 00:36:20,334
And i'll totally
sleep with you.

779
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:24,134
You too.

780
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:26,467
Well, look at you go.

781
00:36:26,501 --> 00:36:29,000
You just made my decision
very, very easy.

782
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:32,900
Mine, too.

783
00:36:32,933 --> 00:36:34,501
Playing the role
of peyton sawyer

784
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:36,701
is miss heidi jay.

785
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,501
Sorry, but the other girl
just wasn't peyton.

786
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:42,601
I had to go with my gut.
No worries.

787
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:44,967
She was peyton last night ...
and i was lucas.

788
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,267
Everyone, welcome
to the table read

789
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,734
for "an unkindness
of ravens."

790
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,267
I am adam reese,
your director.

791
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,334
This is lucas scott,
the writer and producer.

792
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:53,334
Lucas.

793
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:55,134
All right, here it goes.

794
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:58,501
"Fade in. Exterior
tree hill high school. Night.

795
00:36:58,534 --> 00:37:01,100
"Steady traffic filters
into the parking lot

796
00:37:01,134 --> 00:37:03,067
"as a solitary figure
enters frame,

797
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,300
dribbling a worn basketball."

798
00:37:04,334 --> 00:37:06,000
"I'm really lucky
to have basketball.

799
00:37:06,033 --> 00:37:08,834
"It's pretty much my shot
at everything from here on out.

800
00:37:08,868 --> 00:37:10,701
If i lose that,
it's over for me."

801
00:37:10,734 --> 00:37:13,033
Well, well.

802
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:15,768
If it ain't
the jolly green-shoe giant.

803
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:17,501
Oh, that's right.

804
00:37:17,534 --> 00:37:20,501
You only 6'2", so i guess
that'd make you sprout.

805
00:37:20,534 --> 00:37:23,067
What are you doing here,
nino?

806
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,634
Playing point guard.

807
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:27,701
Or at least i will be
as soon as you get the
hell up out of my spot.

808
00:37:27,734 --> 00:37:30,200
Hey...
see you on the court, 12.

809
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:35,734
"When i'm tutoring someone
and they get it

810
00:37:35,768 --> 00:37:37,933
"and that light goes on,
i feel good.

811
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:39,900
I feel worthy."

812
00:37:39,933 --> 00:37:42,467
"So i put soap
in my foster mom's wine ...

813
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:44,134
cleaned her mouth out
for a change."

814
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:46,033
That's so awesome.

815
00:37:46,067 --> 00:37:48,434
Hey, sam, great article.

816
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:04,534
"I wanted you to fight for me.

817
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:07,567
"I wanted you to say
there's no one else that
you could ever be with

818
00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:11,000
and that you'd rather be alone
than without me."

819
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:27,234
Does that look like
mr. Popular to you?

820
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:30,234
I know you're not the person
you were in high school,
'cause i'm not, either.

821
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:33,234
And i'm glad,
because that kid

822
00:38:33,267 --> 00:38:35,601
never would have stood
a chance with you.

823
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:42,701
Were you really
a mathlete?

824
00:38:42,734 --> 00:38:45,601
I was the mathlete.

825
00:38:45,634 --> 00:38:47,734
But i'm not anymore,

826
00:38:47,768 --> 00:38:50,300
and i don't want
high-school brooke.

827
00:38:50,334 --> 00:38:52,601
I'm sorry the breakdown
hurt your feelings.

828
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:55,033
It was meant to describe
who the character was

829
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:57,267
before anyone got to know
the real person.

830
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:05,300
That's a breakdown
describing

831
00:39:05,334 --> 00:39:07,300
the brooke davis
i'm looking for.

832
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:23,234
"Funny. Intelligent.

833
00:39:23,267 --> 00:39:26,501
"Kind-hearted.
Strong-headed."

834
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:30,834
"Simple. Complicated.

835
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,567
"Motherly. Childish.

836
00:39:33,601 --> 00:39:36,434
"Tough. Sensitive.

837
00:39:36,467 --> 00:39:39,868
"Beautiful.

838
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,601
Way cooler than she was
in high school."

839
00:39:45,868 --> 00:39:50,534
That girl has been
nearly impossible to find

840
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:54,067
but worth every second
of the wait.

841
00:39:57,967 --> 00:40:00,300
Are you gonna make sure
missy knows this?

842
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:06,501
I'm gonna make sure
everybody knows.

843
00:40:10,734 --> 00:40:12,367
"I'm glad you're here.

844
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:14,367
"I know we kind of lost
each other for a while there,

845
00:40:14,401 --> 00:40:16,200
but hopefully
that's over, right?"

846
00:40:16,234 --> 00:40:19,401
"It's always gonna be there,
isn't it ...  you and me?"

847
00:40:25,067 --> 00:40:27,267
Is the father
going to be joining us?

848
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,401
No.

849
00:40:28,434 --> 00:40:31,634
Yes...he is.

850
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:34,100
Hey.
How'd you know?

851
00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:36,234
You told me last week.

852
00:40:38,401 --> 00:40:40,501
I'm so happy
you're here, luke.

853
00:40:40,534 --> 00:40:42,234
Are you kidding me?

854
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:44,200
I wouldn't miss this
for the world.

855
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:47,534
That's exactly
what i needed to hear.

856
00:40:52,401 --> 00:40:55,234
That's your baby's
heartbeat.

857
00:41:03,501 --> 00:41:08,067
And that is exactly
what i needed to hear.

858
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,300
Beautiful.

859
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:18,467
"They eye each other,
just a boy and a girl,

860
00:41:18,501 --> 00:41:22,100
alone but together in this place
called tree hill."

861
00:41:30,601 --> 00:41:33,467
Let's make a movie.
