1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Previously on "one tree hill"...

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,400
You ready for tonight?

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,133
bring it on. I got this.

4
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:05,680
Kind of different in the game.

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,601
How different?

6
00:00:06,634 --> 00:00:07,901
Do I even want to ask?

7
00:00:07,934 --> 00:00:10,000
Really, I'm fine.

8
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:16,545
I told you I wanted to be a mom, and you ran away so fast,

9
00:00:16,545 --> 00:00:18,847
You left an owen-shaped hole in my front door.

10
00:00:18,847 --> 00:00:21,230
You're right, and you didn't deserve that.

11
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,267
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,734
You're still a jerk.

13
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:24,901
Hot intern?

14
00:00:24,934 --> 00:00:26,634
- Mouth! - gigi?

15
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:29,050
The nosy guy across the street

16
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,443
Called and said he saw someone breaking in.

17
00:00:30,443 --> 00:00:32,300
That is peyton's wedding dress.

18
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,601
Someone made an offer for the movie rights to my book.

19
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:37,400
For "the comet"? that's great!

20
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,801
Not for the "the comet," but, um, "ravens."

21
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:42,633
You've gotten even more beautiful.

22
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:43,501
What are you doing here, julian?

23
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,000
Optioning your fiances book.

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,334
Like hell you are.

25
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:47,934
Actually, it's already done.

26
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:49,868
I see you two have already met, huh?

27
00:00:49,868 --> 00:00:51,334
Yes, we have.

28
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:53,660
Feels like I've known her for years.

29
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,620
Oh, my god. you're totally inspired by it.

30
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,750
- No, I'm not. - You are, too. admit it.

31
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,418
Your entire new line is gonna be based on

32
00:01:19,418 --> 00:01:21,235
Based on the amazing couture wedding dress

33
00:01:21,235 --> 00:01:23,155
I had already spent 72 hours

34
00:01:23,155 --> 00:01:25,145
Hand-stitching for my best friend?

35
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,734
Oh, wait.

36
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:28,501
That's ruined.

37
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:30,400
You're still pissed.

38
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:32,467
And you're still grounded.

39
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,467
Fine.

40
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:38,534
So, what's your version of grounded?

41
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:40,334
Well, I've been thinking.

42
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,334
One week for exposing a 5-year-old to depravity,

43
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:47,317
Another week for letting some skeevy fratvestite ruin peyton's wedding dress,

44
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:51,500
and we're gonna tack on another week for throwing an underage keg party

45
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,567
In your foster parent's upscale boutique.

46
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:55,934
That's it?

47
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,033
You are not supposed to be happy about this!

48
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:00,400
No, I just thought that thing my friend eugene did

49
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,367
In the bathroom sink was gonna cost me another week.

50
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,000
You...haven't been in the bathroom yet, have you?

51
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:10,580
What did eugene do in the bathroom sink?

52
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,100
Sam!

53
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,200
This is not over, young lady!

54
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:18,367
Didn't think it was, old lady.

55
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:22,234
Don't kill the child. just don't kill the child.

56
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:24,734
What?!

57
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:27,234
Wow. where's nice brooke?

58
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:29,968
I killed her, and I ate her bleeding heart for breakfast,

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,067
And I'm still hungry.

60
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,200
Right.

61
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:33,930
Well, if you see her,

62
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,148
Tell her I enjoyed

63
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:38,369
Cleaning up sam-a-palooza with her last night

64
00:02:38,369 --> 00:02:41,050
And that I plan on bringing her a gift every day

65
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,968
Until she's ready to reconsider me.

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,300
Every day?

67
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:46,300
Whether you like it or not.

68
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:49,360
Gold, godiva, gucci, gerber

69
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,980
My jewelry, chocolate, purse, and flower preferences.

70
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,234
I guess I'll be seeing you tomorrow.

71
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:56,567
Wait -- gerber?

72
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:59,334
Daisies.

73
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:01,910
But sunflowers are very nice, too.

74
00:03:02,634 --> 00:03:04,200
Bye, now.

75
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,830
You are just in time.

76
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,028
For what -- hibernation?

77
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:14,800
No.

78
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,601
I saw your slamball schedule for the next three weeks,

79
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:17,357
And it looks pretty grueling,

80
00:03:17,357 --> 00:03:18,968
So I thought you better stock up.

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,010
Haley, 90,000 calories a day is not gonna keep me

82
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,348
From getting hit on the slamball court.

83
00:03:23,348 --> 00:03:26,027
No, but it'll give you a little extra padding when you do.

84
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:32,134
I cleared a place for your trophy.

85
00:03:32,134 --> 00:03:34,667
You know, I don't think they give you trophies in slamball, buddy.

86
00:03:34,701 --> 00:03:36,734
Not even for champions?

87
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:38,133
That's pretty lame, huh?

88
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:40,968
How are you supposed to know you're awesome without a trophy?

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,133
Well, I guess you're gonna have to keep telling me.

90
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:48,267
Go eat your breakfast in front of the tv,

91
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,033
All right, little bear?

92
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:51,334
Okay.

93
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:53,167
Good luck.

94
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:57,934
It's really good.

95
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:05,167
How you feeling?

96
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,234
I think you may have had one too many mojitos at tric last night.

97
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:11,167
Ohh, I know -- headache.

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,634
Thanks.

99
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:17,968
So, what was your first impression of julian last night, huh?

100
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,033
Peyton, I love you,

101
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:27,734
And I want us to be together forever.

102
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,093
Luke, wait. it's just not as simple as all of that, okay?

103
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:33,200
I mean, there's a lot we have to talk about.

104
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:35,089
You're saying no.

105
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:37,400
No. I love you so much.

106
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:39,400
Just not enough.

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,033
Hey, I need you to go on a coffee run.

108
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:44,901
Okay. in a minute.

109
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:46,701
I don't have a minute.

110
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:49,867
I said I need a minute.

111
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:55,968
God!

112
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,546
Probably just a jam in the three-hole-punch tray total pain in the ass,

113
00:05:04,546 --> 00:05:06,234
but definitely not worth a pretty girl crying over.

114
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,778
You know, the last thing I need right now

115
00:05:08,778 --> 00:05:12,006
Is some -- some shallow, egocentric

116
00:05:12,006 --> 00:05:14,968
Hotshot music producer hitting on me.

117
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:22,440
Okay, just for the sake of argument,

118
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,612
What if I was more of a failed guitarist

119
00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:27,918
Turned fledging indie-movie-producer type?

120
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,963
No. right.

121
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,939
You know, the best thing about a paper jam?

122
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:37,731
What?

123
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:39,273
It forces you to open up the machine,

124
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:42,000
Figure out what went wrong in the first place.

125
00:05:59,501 --> 00:06:01,197
He was charismatic.

126
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,660
What you doing?

127
00:06:05,082 --> 00:06:08,501
If you haven't heard, I'm a big screenwriter now.

128
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,067
Screenwriter.

129
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,314
Luke, about that

130
00:06:12,314 --> 00:06:15,050
I think I really needed this, you know?

131
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,200
With everything that happened with "the comet," I just

132
00:06:18,234 --> 00:06:19,534
It's nice to know

133
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:22,968
That your work has merit and relevance, you know?

134
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,767
Yeah. of course.

135
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,820
I am nervous, though.

136
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,062
I mean, julian already has a studio interested.

137
00:06:31,062 --> 00:06:33,800
And they want a first draft in, like...

138
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:44,967
Three weeks.

139
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,387
Did you even sleep?

140
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,905
Oh, yeah, a little.

141
00:06:50,905 --> 00:06:52,590
Eh, not really. no.

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,810
Well, you wouldn't tell from the script.

143
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,045
It's -- it's good, luke.

144
00:06:56,045 --> 00:06:57,862
Yeah, but not great.

145
00:06:57,862 --> 00:06:59,284
Very close to great.

146
00:06:59,284 --> 00:07:02,100
In fact, I'd say one scene away from great,

147
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:06,300
And I think you know exactly which scene I'm talking about

148
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:07,501
Keith's murder.

149
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,033
And I know you wanted me to show it,

150
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:14,583
But I just thought that maybe it'd be more effective

151
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,234
If we find out after the fact -- you know, cinematically?

152
00:07:18,434 --> 00:07:20,701
Okay, well, I don't want to flaunt my experience,

153
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:23,093
But cinematically, it doesn't get much better

154
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:24,901
Than seeing a man kill his brother.

155
00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:28,567
Well, that man who was murdered...

156
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:30,033
Was my uncle.

157
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:33,685
Which is, I think, why you didn't write the scene.

158
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:35,027
You're too close to it.

159
00:07:35,027 --> 00:07:37,886
But our audience needs to face what happened, luke...

160
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:40,200
...even if you can't.

161
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:43,601
Just give it a try.

162
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:44,701
Trust me.

163
00:07:44,734 --> 00:07:47,834
I'll put off the studio until tomorrow, okay?

164
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,167
You can do this.

165
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:53,000
And if I can't?

166
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:54,934
To be blunt,

167
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:56,934
Then I'll find a writer who can.

168
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,400
I'm broke.

169
00:08:09,434 --> 00:08:11,800
You're 5. you're supposed to be broke.

170
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,400
Undefeated for the last three weeks,

171
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:15,701
Fans expect the slashers to be carried through

172
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:18,100
Tonight's semifinal slamball game against the mob

173
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,400
On the shoulders of former college standout nathan scott.

174
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,868
That is, of course, unless jerome garret,

175
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:25,712
Hit man for the mob, has anything to say about it.

176
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:27,590
We're not afraid of nathan scott.

177
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,128
Man, that chump's always been more hype than skill.

178
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:33,700
Well, and there you have it from the hit man himself.

179
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,000
Back to you guys.

180
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,033
They should just give you the trophy, daddy.

181
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:40,601
I tried to tell you

182
00:08:40,634 --> 00:08:43,934
They don't give you trophies in slamball, buddy.

183
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:46,367
I checked for you and everything.

184
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,534
Sorry.

185
00:08:51,734 --> 00:08:53,567
Come on, brooke.

186
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:55,023
If you could fill this place up with anything,

187
00:08:55,023 --> 00:08:56,734
What would it be?

188
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:59,000
What did you get me?

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,234
Peyton

190
00:09:00,234 --> 00:09:01,680
Well, don't act so disappointed.

191
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,335
Last time I checked, I was your only customer.

192
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,039
Yeah.

193
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,779
It's a good thing I like the emperor's new clothes.

194
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:09,221
I'm sorry.

195
00:09:09,221 --> 00:09:11,480
It's just that owen's been coming by every day

196
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,260
For the last three weeks to bring me loot.

197
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,335
Well, I did not know you were into him again.

198
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,595
I'm not totally sure I am yet, but I am into loot.

199
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,567
Brooke, what owen did was uncool,

200
00:09:25,601 --> 00:09:27,826
But it is equally uncool to lead him on

201
00:09:27,826 --> 00:09:30,237
Just because you like getting presents every day.

202
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,434
Really?

203
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:33,100
I'm getting relationship advice

204
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,400
From the girl who waited three weeks to tell her fiance

205
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,334
That he's making a movie with her ex-boyfriend.

206
00:09:39,334 --> 00:09:41,567
Three weeks and counting.

207
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:43,588
Peyton, you haven't told him yet?

208
00:09:43,588 --> 00:09:47,455
Um, no...but, anyway, changing the subject,

209
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:48,923
When do I get to see my wedding dress?

210
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:51,163
You may not need a dress, my friend.

211
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:53,167
Changing the subject back.

212
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:55,067
Lucas is gonna be really upset

213
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:57,234
When he finds out you've been keeping this from him.

214
00:09:57,267 --> 00:10:00,160
I know. It's just he's really excited about writing again,

215
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,000
And he genuinely likes julian,

216
00:10:02,142 --> 00:10:06,000
and I don't want my stupid past to get in the way of this for him.

217
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:09,133
Well, how serious were you and julian?

218
00:10:29,968 --> 00:10:31,701
Oh, sorry. sorry.

219
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:34,100
Excuse me.I'm sorry.

220
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,276
Oh, hey, if it isn't the saddest girl in the world.

221
00:10:36,276 --> 00:10:37,601
I'm not sad.

222
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:39,140
Okay, but I've only met you twice,

223
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,313
And both times, you were crying.

224
00:10:40,313 --> 00:10:42,367
Maybe they're tears of joy.

225
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,434
True. are they?

226
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:45,335
- No. - okay, good.

227
00:10:45,335 --> 00:10:46,630
'cause I got a favor to ask.

228
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,040
How would you like to accompany me

229
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,488
To this hideous industry party full of snooty rich people

230
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:53,830
And "shallow, egocentric hotshot producer" types?

231
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,220
That sounds awful.

232
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,511
So, is that a yes?

233
00:10:57,511 --> 00:11:00,601
You really want the saddest girl in the world as your date?

234
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:01,950
Oh, no. no. no. it's not a date.

235
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,267
I just want your tears.

236
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,200
One look at the crying girl on my arm,

237
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:07,534
And nobody's gonna wonder why I'm leaving early.

238
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,982
Hold on. what'd I say?

239
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:12,795
Because if you start smiling like that,

240
00:11:12,795 --> 00:11:14,634
We're gonna be stuck at this thing.

241
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,902
Oh, I am totally underdressed.

242
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:28,089
No. no. you look great.

243
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,582
Besides, this is hollywood.

244
00:11:29,582 --> 00:11:32,281
The worse you dress, the more important people assume you are.

245
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:34,100
Oh, they must assume I'm the pope.

246
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,567
Oh, wow. thank you. thanks for coming.

247
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:40,400
You didn't tell me it was your bar mitzvah.

248
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,005
It's a fund-raiser for a script I'm trying to get made.

249
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:45,934
I know -- talk about boring.

250
00:11:45,968 --> 00:11:47,601
It's a good thing you brought a book.

251
00:11:47,634 --> 00:11:50,968
Um...yeah. I was hoping to get it signed.

252
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,651
I used to be close with the author.

253
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:56,113
I feel really dumb for bringing it in.

254
00:11:56,113 --> 00:11:59,563
Oh, no. don't. what's it about?

255
00:11:59,563 --> 00:12:01,634
Me, sort of.

256
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,038
Then I completely understand why you wanted it here with you.

257
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,133
Now, see, there's that smile again.

258
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:10,000
Now we're never gonna get out of here.

259
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:12,167
Oh, I guess we'll have to make the best of it.

260
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,734
Oh, you bet.

261
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,033
Oh, okay. thank you.

262
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:19,990
That was a scout.

263
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,802
He's passing through town on his way to virginia.

264
00:12:21,802 --> 00:12:24,138
He's gonna try to stop by and see the slamball semifinal.

265
00:12:24,138 --> 00:12:25,138
Well, that's cool, nate.

266
00:12:25,138 --> 00:12:27,400
If anyone deserves a second look, it's you.

267
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,970
Hey, speaking of the game,

268
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,410
Any hard feelings if I can't make it?

269
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,400
Julian wants to get the script to the studio tomorrow,

270
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,588
So I'm sort of in crisis mode.

271
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:37,691
No worries, man.

272
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:40,018
I'll see you at the championship after we win tonight.

273
00:12:40,018 --> 00:12:41,834
Absolutely.

274
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:44,045
Can I ask you a question?

275
00:12:44,601 --> 00:12:49,296
What was your best memory of dan?

276
00:12:49,296 --> 00:12:52,105
I don't know. the day he went to prison.

277
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,300
Michael jordan basketball camp.

278
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,013
Yeah, I was about 10 years old,

279
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:08,928
And dan pulled some strings to get me in,

280
00:13:08,928 --> 00:13:11,228
And it was the first day,

281
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:13,634
And we were in this, like, meet-and-greet line,

282
00:13:13,634 --> 00:13:16,839
And jordan was gonna pick one of us kids to play one-on-one against.

283
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,120
I remember I was so nervous,

284
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,945
My knees were about to buckle.

285
00:13:20,945 --> 00:13:22,729
And I think dan could feel that

286
00:13:22,729 --> 00:13:25,080
'cause he put his hand on my shoulder to steady me,

287
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,000
And when jordan finally came by,

288
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,100
He just looked at him and said,

289
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,251
"this is my son, nathan. he's got a great jump shot."

290
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,900
And what happened?

291
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,590
I played one-on-one against the greatest player in history.

292
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,483
It was one of the best days of my life.

293
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:47,200
Why? what's with the question?

294
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,534
I have this scene to write, and I'm trying to be objective.

295
00:13:56,667 --> 00:14:00,700
I guess I'm just wondering if dan ever had a soul.

296
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,100
Sure, he did.

297
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,533
He sold it a long time ago.

298
00:14:06,683 --> 00:14:10,618
Bright the man on the way he is evil.

299
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:13,250
That is what he deserves.

300
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:26,865
So, this is how the great nathan scott

301
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:28,538
Warms up for a semifinal game.

302
00:14:28,538 --> 00:14:30,624
You, uh, looking for an exclusive?

303
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:32,538
I'm here as a friend.

304
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,784
Jerome garrett was talking about putting you back

305
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:37,031
in your wheelchair during tonight's game.

306
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:38,458
He sounded serious.

307
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,013
Oh, I'm sure he is. he's a bitter guy.

308
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,627
He was only a basket away from the sweet 16

309
00:14:42,627 --> 00:14:44,241
Two years ago when I got in the way.

310
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:47,308
I remember, and from the sound of it, so does he.

311
00:14:47,308 --> 00:14:49,443
I appreciate the heads-up, mouth.

312
00:14:49,443 --> 00:14:52,066
I'll be fine, though. I can take care of myself.

313
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:53,933
Plus, I got owen watching my back.

314
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:56,430
He's one of the toughest guys in tree hill.

315
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,130
Hello, beautiful. aah!

316
00:15:12,734 --> 00:15:14,500
What the hell are you doing?!

317
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,020
Sneaking up on a girl is so not cool!

318
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,450
What? I thought you'd like it.

319
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,878
"what's underneath the clothes," right?

320
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,533
I'm a girl. it's sexy.

321
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:27,200
You are a huge, hairy dude on my leather seats!

322
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,729
Ow! at least you think I'm huge!

323
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:30,822
Get out! all right!

324
00:15:30,822 --> 00:15:34,100
All right! all right! hey! all right!

325
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,067
Wait. brooke. hey.

326
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,267
Wait. you made your point!

327
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:40,001
Stop!

328
00:15:40,034 --> 00:15:42,767
You have my clothes!

329
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,000
So, pooky wooky bear pretty much finds out

330
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,378
He's been a crummy friend

331
00:15:56,378 --> 00:15:58,009
And has to say he's sorry.

332
00:16:00,368 --> 00:16:03,562
All right. chapter nine tonight, guys.

333
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,034
Good job.

334
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,201
So, don't tell your mom,

335
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:12,267
But that was pretty much the best lecture of the year.

336
00:16:12,301 --> 00:16:13,567
Uh, I heard that.

337
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,134
Hey, you have, uh, study hall next, right? yeah.

338
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:19,101
Would you mind watching jamie for a little bit?

339
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:20,700
I got to run to the office.

340
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:23,001
Sure. anything to avoid economics homework.

341
00:16:23,034 --> 00:16:24,754
Let's go, muchacho.

342
00:16:24,754 --> 00:16:26,368
Awesome.

343
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,334
Sam, no parties, okay?

344
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,959
What's economics?

345
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:39,720
It's how you make money.

346
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,700
I thought that was called an allowance.

347
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,788
No.

348
00:16:44,788 --> 00:16:46,462
An allowance you actually have to work for.

349
00:16:46,462 --> 00:16:49,075
Economics is easier. it's just supply and demand.

350
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,075
Sounds complicated.

351
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:53,001
No. this is your stake.

352
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:56,356
You use it to buy your supply, which is what you just got.

353
00:16:56,356 --> 00:17:00,400
All you need to do is create a little demand.

354
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,576
Come on, man. that's nasty.

355
00:17:05,576 --> 00:17:09,083
Bummer, huh? good thing we got everything you want right there.

356
00:17:10,034 --> 00:17:12,001
I'll take some chips.

357
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:13,167
2 bucks.

358
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:21,800
You only paid 50 cents for those.

359
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:25,267
That, grasshopper, is called a profit.

360
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,767
I don't have 2 bucks.

361
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,267
It's okay. that's called a kickback. it's free.

362
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:38,126
That is what you get when you're in cahoots.

363
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:40,834
Nice.

364
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:51,700
Hey. you okay?

365
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:54,001
Yeah.

366
00:17:54,034 --> 00:17:55,334
No. no.

367
00:17:55,368 --> 00:17:58,767
Um, I have to write keith's murder scene in the screenplay,

368
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,401
And i...don't know if I can do it.

369
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:05,001
I just can't imagine people sitting in a theater

370
00:18:05,034 --> 00:18:07,667
Eating popcorn, watching keith get shot to death.

371
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,667
Maybe it could be more than that.

372
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,000
Maybe...like in literature,

373
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,234
A violent death can often be a catalyst for change

374
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:17,600
Or... a lesson in humanity.

375
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:23,900
I don't want my audience to understand dan scott, okay?

376
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:27,200
I don't want to make dan scott a more conflicted character

377
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,167
For the sake of a more complex plotline.

378
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:31,767
Dan scott isn't human.

379
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,633
He doesn't deserve to be forgiven.

380
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:36,934
Frankly...

381
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:41,234
Dan scott doesn't deserve a spot in jamie's life.

382
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:43,201
Luke.

383
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:48,767
I'm sorry, hales. it's none of my business.

384
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,500
My head's just been...

385
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:54,934
I should go. I'm sorry.

386
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:12,934
Look, I get it, and I love the band,

387
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:14,367
And you know I love you,

388
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:16,234
But this ship is gonna sail without you

389
00:19:16,234 --> 00:19:18,967
If you guys can't cut through all the red tape.

390
00:19:19,001 --> 00:19:22,167
Well, if you can't cut through that red tape,

391
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:23,567
Then I'll find somebody who can.

392
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,134
This may come as a surprise to you,

393
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,934
But you're not the only line producer in town.

394
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:31,201
Be nice.

395
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:35,834
Look, josh, uh, I know you're trying.

396
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:39,067
Just do me a favor and try a little harder.

397
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:42,167
It's all gonna get done.

398
00:19:42,201 --> 00:19:44,500
I think it's a bad idea that I moved in with you.

399
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,167
Why?

400
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:48,034
Because if I get any nicer,

401
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:50,401
My film's not gonna get to sundance.

402
00:19:50,434 --> 00:19:51,934
Oh, but you'll get me,

403
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:55,267
And I am way sexier than sundance.

404
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,900
I love you.

405
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,767
I love you, too.

406
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,810
Thanks for picking me up, grandpa.

407
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,734
Are you kidding me? I'd do anything for you.

408
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:29,101
Can you stake me 10 bucks?

409
00:20:29,134 --> 00:20:30,767
What for?

410
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,767
I...got some business.

411
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,934
I don't know. that's a lot of money.

412
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,134
Please. I'll totally cut you in.

413
00:20:38,734 --> 00:20:40,834
Sounds like a solid investment.

414
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:43,034
Sweet.

415
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:47,101
I also have to make a quick stop on the way to school.

416
00:20:47,134 --> 00:20:49,101
You're the boss.

417
00:21:00,901 --> 00:21:02,855
I'm not writing this.

418
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,446
I thought julian said he'd find another writer.

419
00:21:06,446 --> 00:21:08,434
I'm hoping he's bluffing.

420
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,737
You want to tell me why this is so hard?

421
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:19,885
I don't really know

422
00:21:19,885 --> 00:21:22,542
What happened in keith's final moments,

423
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:25,100
And I'm not gonna just make it up

424
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,533
So that julian's movie can be more dramatic, you know?

425
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:31,380
I mean -- I mean, think about it.

426
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,967
Did he... did he beg for mercy?

427
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:37,101
Did he -- did he cry?

428
00:21:37,134 --> 00:21:40,067
Was he shocked? did he feel betrayed?

429
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:42,533
Or maybe dan should be...

430
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:46,101
Conflicted and, uh...

431
00:21:46,134 --> 00:21:48,134
Pitiable.

432
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I can't write that.

433
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:02,334
Do you know what I love about you

434
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:05,567
Is that you're always protecting everybody?

435
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,834
But you don't have to protect keith,

436
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:13,067
And, I mean, regardless of what the scene becomes,

437
00:22:13,101 --> 00:22:17,060
I'm pretty sure he would rather you

438
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,400
Write his last moments than anybody else.

439
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,968
I just wish I knew the truth.

440
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:34,900
Got to go.

441
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,400
Okay, but I can't get my bag zipped up.

442
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,301
It's three days in sundance.

443
00:22:40,334 --> 00:22:43,100
How full can your bag possibly be?

444
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:47,360
Like this full.

445
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,600
You got to be kidding.

446
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,570
Oh, maybe my big, strong boyfriend

447
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,400
Can use his muscles to zip it up for me.

448
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,500
We are so gonna miss our plane.

449
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:57,300
Thank you.

450
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:06,000
Well, I think I found the problem.

451
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:11,134
I was just gonna read it on the plane.

452
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:13,368
For what -- the thousandth time?

453
00:23:13,401 --> 00:23:14,734
It's not a big deal.

454
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:16,134
No, it is a big deal.

455
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,734
It's just a book.

456
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:18,500
Come on.

457
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,434
You buy copies of this thing every time you see it.

458
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,434
You carry one around in your purse half the time.

459
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:24,533
You think it's lost on me

460
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:26,301
That it was written by your ex-boyfriend?

461
00:23:26,334 --> 00:23:28,120
So it's important to me.

462
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,628
I mean, do you think it's lost on me

463
00:23:29,628 --> 00:23:31,567
That you've never bothered to read it?

464
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,293
Are you curious at all?

465
00:23:33,293 --> 00:23:34,290
Yeah, I'm curious.

466
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,368
I'm curious as to whether there will ever come a day

467
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:39,900
When I'm not sharing you with lucas scott.

468
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,901
You know what? I'm tired of this.

469
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:48,872
Where are you going?

470
00:23:48,872 --> 00:23:50,667
Sundance, alone.

471
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,000
What?

472
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,667
You want to go with the book...

473
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,830
Be my guest.

474
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:00,170
Get a nice suite, go skiing, cozy up by the fire,

475
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,340
And talk about your future together.

476
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,129
I really hope both of you are very happy.

477
00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:04,533
Julian.

478
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:07,767
I can't do this anymore, peyton.

479
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,468
I don't want to.

480
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:13,434
Goodbye.

481
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:29,452
Nice brooke would like to apologize

482
00:24:29,452 --> 00:24:31,500
For the way that evil brooke acted this morning.

483
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,117
Well, you should've stuck around.

484
00:24:33,117 --> 00:24:35,590
I mean, you haven't lived until you've been naked

485
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,100
In the back of a squad car that smells like bum piss.

486
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,983
How about you just keep whatever gift you were bringing today,

487
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,983
And we call this whole mess even?

488
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:49,300
I didn't bring a gift, and I'm done bringing them.

489
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,757
You know, winning you back is one thing,

490
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:53,900
But being led on, it's...

491
00:24:53,934 --> 00:24:55,500
It's humiliating.

492
00:24:55,533 --> 00:24:58,065
I just came by to tell you that

493
00:24:58,066 --> 00:25:00,434
I won't bother you anymore.

494
00:25:00,468 --> 00:25:02,567
Owen.

495
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,700
I'll see you around, brooke davis.

496
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,600
So, you still got some stuff?

497
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,900
Whatever you want.

498
00:25:29,334 --> 00:25:30,600
2 bucks.

499
00:25:30,633 --> 00:25:32,800
2 bucks?! that's a total rip!

500
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:35,267
Fine. guess you're gonna have to wait till snacktime.

501
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:37,567
I hear we're having raisins.

502
00:25:44,101 --> 00:25:46,633
That's my whole allowance.

503
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,734
Economics pays better!

504
00:26:02,201 --> 00:26:03,468
Excuse me.

505
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,200
Why are you here?

506
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,045
Is -- is that a trick question?

507
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,030
If optioning lucas's screenplay

508
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,967
Is just part of some grand scheme to get me back,

509
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:56,230
You can forget it, all right?

510
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,900
I am done lying to him about us.

511
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,134
I'm sorry.

512
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:01,445
Do you really think I would blow my reputation

513
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:03,410
And a studio's multimillion-dollar investment

514
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,900
To get you back?

515
00:27:05,267 --> 00:27:07,334
Peyton, I left you.

516
00:27:07,368 --> 00:27:10,745
And as far as lying to lucas, I never asked you to do that.

517
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:13,867
Frankly, I really don't care if he knows about us.

518
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,633
I didn't tell him out of respect for your engagement.

519
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:19,187
In fact, I think I've handled the whole situation

520
00:27:19,187 --> 00:27:20,434
Like a professional.

521
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,110
Now, if you don't mind,

522
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:26,533
I think my date should probably be here any minute.

523
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,200
Peyton... why did you lie to lucas?

524
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,650
Because if it's a part of some grand scheme to get me back...

525
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I'd be curious.

526
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,446
It's called supply and demand.

527
00:27:46,446 --> 00:27:48,000
No, it's called taking advantage,

528
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,990
And it's not very nice.

529
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:49,990
Sit down.

530
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:54,462
What is this?

531
00:27:54,462 --> 00:27:55,313
A kickback

532
00:27:55,313 --> 00:27:57,900
It's yours to keep if you're in cahoots.

533
00:27:57,934 --> 00:28:01,000
I most certainly am not in cahoots.

534
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,145
Didn't you learn anything from your pooky wooky book?

535
00:28:03,145 --> 00:28:05,992
Treating your friends well is more important than extorting them.

536
00:28:05,992 --> 00:28:07,700
What's extorting?

537
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:11,700
I think you've learned enough economics for one day.

538
00:28:11,734 --> 00:28:16,267
I just want to buy daddy a slamball trophy.

539
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:19,201
You're a sweet kid,

540
00:28:19,234 --> 00:28:21,700
Even if you are too smart for your own good sometimes.

541
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:23,633
So we're in cahoots?

542
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,134
No. no. we're not in cahoots.

543
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:26,800
I'm gonna spank your little cahoot

544
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:27,725
If you don't go out there

545
00:28:27,725 --> 00:28:30,401
And give all your friends their money back right now.

546
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,909
One. two. three. Slashers!

547
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,300
Let's go.

548
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,500
Who are you looking for?

549
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,130
Nobody. this scout, he was supposed to show up.

550
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,300
I guess he couldn't make it.

551
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,667
This whole time, I thought you were showing off for me.

552
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,765
That's funny. I thought you were showing off for brooke.

553
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,666
Looks like we were both showing off

554
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:16,368
For people who don't care.

555
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,625
What do you say we play these last five minutes

556
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:23,780
For the people who do?

557
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,200
You're on.

558
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:35,567
The cemetery called.

559
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,834
Apparently, somebody gave my tombstone a makeover.

560
00:30:39,867 --> 00:30:43,468
Any idea who'd do something like that?

561
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,401
What happened in the hallway?

562
00:30:46,434 --> 00:30:48,310
I assume you mean...

563
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,134
Keith.

564
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,368
I've been asked to adapt my novel for a movie.

565
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,567
They want me to write what happened.

566
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,533
I can't do it.

567
00:31:02,534 --> 00:31:03,854
I can't see it.

568
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:09,100
And I can't understand it.

569
00:31:19,438 --> 00:31:22,067
Keith was holding jimmy edwards in the hallway.

570
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,666
He turned, and I shot him dead before he could say a word.

571
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,497
Keith was a hero.

572
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,650
You want to write the truth, you write it that way.

573
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,601
Why'd you do it?

574
00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:46,767
Every good story needs a villain, lucas.

575
00:31:46,801 --> 00:31:48,734
I'm sorry, but I'm yours.

576
00:32:17,305 --> 00:32:18,375
I'm worried about daddy.

577
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:20,750
Yeah, me too, buddy, but the game's almost over, okay?

578
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,696
Do you know what I haven't had in my lap lately?

579
00:32:23,696 --> 00:32:25,410
It's not really a secret.

580
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,450
A jamie scott.

581
00:32:29,067 --> 00:32:32,280
Sorry about teaching jamie how to make money off of his friends.

582
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,045
I just wanted him to think I was cool.

583
00:32:34,045 --> 00:32:37,700
I...Didn't mean to get him in trouble.

584
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,843
You know, jamie really looks up to you.

585
00:32:40,843 --> 00:32:43,644
You've got a great opportunity to be a role model to him.

586
00:32:43,644 --> 00:32:44,693
You just have to choose it,

587
00:32:44,693 --> 00:32:48,633
And that takes a commitment to making good choices for both of you.

588
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,577
Just think about that next time.

589
00:32:52,734 --> 00:32:54,067
Sorry.

590
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,200
Time-out! time-out!

591
00:33:01,301 --> 00:33:03,111
Owen, you're out.

592
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,134
I'm fine!

593
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:07,201
Owen, come on, man. listen, take a seat.

594
00:33:07,234 --> 00:33:08,334
Take a seat.

595
00:33:08,368 --> 00:33:10,588
I appreciate you being my guardian angel,

596
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,301
But I can take it from here, all right?

597
00:33:12,334 --> 00:33:13,434
I got this.

598
00:33:13,468 --> 00:33:16,368
Me, you, 15 seconds and one basket, scott

599
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:17,734
That sound familiar?

600
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:19,040
Yeah, only one tiny difference.

601
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,900
Unlike you, I won't choke.

602
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,332
Ugh. daddy.

603
00:34:57,067 --> 00:34:59,034
Hey. I'm fine, see?

604
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:00,667
I'm all right.

605
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:06,200
Don't play slamball anymore, daddy.

606
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:53,665
I liked it better when you were naked.

607
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:56,633
I liked it better when you were a guy I thought I could count on.

608
00:35:58,101 --> 00:35:59,623
I'm sorry.

609
00:35:59,623 --> 00:36:02,334
I should've never let you bring me presents

610
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:05,734
If I wasn't totally sure I saw a future with us.

611
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,120
What do you see now?

612
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,185
I see my foster child acting like a total idiot.

613
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,200
I have my work cut out for me with that one.

614
00:36:26,134 --> 00:36:27,533
Brooke

615
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,001
I'm crazy about you.

616
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:36,834
And I think you are a truly great guy

617
00:36:36,867 --> 00:36:40,301
Who has the potential to be a great boyfriend.

618
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,900
Just not your boyfriend.

619
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:47,101
I didn't say that.

620
00:36:47,134 --> 00:36:48,624
It's just that right now,

621
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:52,942
I have the opportunity to be a great role model for sam,

622
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,834
And that means I have to put her first.

623
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,300
I can respect that.

624
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,500
What about down the road?

625
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,700
For a guy like you...

626
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,700
I might just come crawling back.

627
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,400
I'll see ya.

628
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,460
Playstation, pizza, pinball, pie

629
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:38,334
My video game, fast food, arcade, and dessert preferences.

630
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,000
I'll keep those in mind.

631
00:37:53,134 --> 00:37:54,401
I wrote it.

632
00:37:54,434 --> 00:37:55,834
Oh, you're not gonna regret it.

633
00:37:55,867 --> 00:37:58,472
I'm right about this, luke. you got to trust me.

634
00:37:58,767 --> 00:38:00,867
Hey, come in. come in. I got to take this.

635
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,743
Bobby, yeah. yeah.

636
00:38:02,743 --> 00:38:05,500
The script is on its way, and you are going to love it.

637
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,468
Yeah, he wrote the scene.

638
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,300
Of course it's great. he's a great writer.

639
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,370
Yeah, no, you've got nothing to worry about.

640
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,112
I think I'm cashing in.

641
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,000
Oh, come on.

642
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,997
We've got everything we need to pull an all-nighter

643
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:39,497
Food, coffee.

644
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,931
We have beer...

645
00:38:41,964 --> 00:38:43,198
Had beer.

646
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:46,000
Yeah, it sounds like fun, but I should get home.

647
00:38:47,797 --> 00:38:49,497
Don't.

648
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:52,330
Gigi, I have a girlfriend.

649
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,464
And she doesn't have to know.

650
00:38:59,263 --> 00:39:01,700
I'm not trying to be your girlfriend, mouth.

651
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,652
I'm just trying to be the girl you pull a crazy all-nighter

652
00:39:04,652 --> 00:39:07,300
That nobody ever has to find out about with.

653
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,464
Come on. I'm proud of you for this.

654
00:39:12,497 --> 00:39:15,497
You know, it's one thing to admit your mistakes,

655
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:18,530
But it's another to make them right.

656
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,664
What... is your grand plan?

657
00:39:27,797 --> 00:39:29,353
Let's jet.

658
00:39:29,353 --> 00:39:31,762
You can't do that! that's stealing!

659
00:39:31,762 --> 00:39:33,950
There is a security camera in here.

660
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,330
- It's broken.  - How do you know?

661
00:39:35,363 --> 00:39:37,231
Because I broke it. 

662
00:39:37,232 --> 00:39:38,500
Sam

663
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,464
Damn it.

664
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:44,198
You're a good mom. you're a good mom.

665
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:48,830
Hi, body.

666
00:39:48,831 --> 00:39:50,864
I'm in one piece.

667
00:39:50,897 --> 00:39:54,297
I was scared that you were gonna be like...

668
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,630
Before.

669
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:57,931
Ah, come here.

670
00:40:00,997 --> 00:40:02,557
Listen to me.

671
00:40:02,557 --> 00:40:05,873
I'm never gonna be like that again, okay?

672
00:40:06,297 --> 00:40:08,381
None of this is worth losing my ability

673
00:40:08,381 --> 00:40:10,731
To hold my son when he's afraid...

674
00:40:10,764 --> 00:40:14,864
And my wife when she needs me.

675
00:40:14,897 --> 00:40:17,731
It's okay. I'm done with slamball.

676
00:40:17,764 --> 00:40:19,420
But the championship.

677
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,130
I don't care about the championship.

678
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,149
If these are the last two trophies I ever get,

679
00:40:23,149 --> 00:40:25,100
I will consider myself a lucky man.

680
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,164
Good, 'cause I gave all my profit back.

681
00:40:27,198 --> 00:40:28,363
What?

682
00:40:28,397 --> 00:40:30,564
Your son started a business today.

683
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:32,897
Oh, yeah? how'd it go?

684
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:37,952
Well, I broke even, and grandpa dan lost his shirt.

685
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:40,030
What? grandpa dan lost his shirt?

686
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,931
Luke, it's great.

687
00:40:53,964 --> 00:40:56,897
Julian was right. it needed that scene.

688
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,430
What made you change your mind about writing it?

689
00:41:00,464 --> 00:41:03,187
Just realized it wasn't about a murder.

690
00:41:04,164 --> 00:41:06,980
It's about how your heart breaks...

691
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:10,034
When your hero dies.

692
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,931
I'm okay with the world seeing that.

693
00:41:16,397 --> 00:41:21,131
Okay, I need to tell you something, and...

694
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,031
Does it involve this?

695
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,831
So you dated...

696
00:41:34,864 --> 00:41:36,297
In l.a.?

697
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,931
We were in love.
