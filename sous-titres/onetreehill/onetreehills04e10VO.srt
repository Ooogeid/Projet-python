1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,000
Merry christmas!

2
00:00:03,749 --> 00:00:05,113
Merry christmas, george!

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,274
Merry christmas, movie house!

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,574
Lucas: have you ever wondered 
what marks our time here...

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,878
if one life can really make
 an impact on the world...

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,340
or if the choices we make matter?

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,700
Sometimes, in order to move forward,

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,975
You have to go back.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,263
In this case, just a few minutes.

10
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,588
So, the doctor said you're fine,
you and the baby?

11
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,611
Yeah. We're fine. 
We are all gonna be fine.

12
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,132
Listen...

13
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,659
there's a reason that i played 
so bad tonight at first.

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,365
What do you mean?

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,602
Nathan, look out!

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,605
Aah!

17
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,605
Haley!

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,114
Haley! Baby!

19
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,249
Baby!

20
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,358
Oh, god!

21
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,600
What happened?!

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,590
They just hit her, man!

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,136
I'll call 911!

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,995
Lucas, stay with her.

25
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,315
Son of a bitch!

26
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,586
What did you do?!

27
00:01:50,413 --> 00:01:51,730
Nathan!

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,398
He's dead.

29
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,014
You killed him, son.

30
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,020
Go on.

31
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,600
Dad?

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,000
Hay needs you, nathan.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,201
Your child needs you.

34
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,561
Go!

35
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,766
She's been hit by a car. 
You've got to help her.

36
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,300
She's pregnant.

37
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,680
Man: what's her name? 
Uh...haley.

38
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,900
How long has she been pregnant?

39
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,995
I don't know. A few...

40
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,653
come on, haley.

41
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,136
If -- If sh--

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,435
He passed out. I got him.

43
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,389
Hold on.

44
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,300
Heart's not beating.

45
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,153
I got a full cardiac arrest. 
Requesting backup.

46
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:08,331
Hey!

47
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:18,479
Excuse me. 
Can you tell me what's happening?

48
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:24,062
Hi, luke.

49
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:27,688
Keith, it's you, right? 
You're alive. Not exactly.

50
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,367
What do you mean, "not exactly"?

51
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:31,067
All in good time, luke. 
We don't want to be late.

52
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:31,945
Late for what?

53
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,467
Haley.

54
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:39,967
What happened to her?

55
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:41,266
You don't remember?

56
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:44,983
I... there was an accident.

57
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:46,836
It was no accident.

58
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,667
I was right there with haley.

59
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:52,087
I was standing right there.

60
00:04:57,267 --> 00:04:58,276
Oh.

61
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:00,067
My heart.

62
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:02,729
Your heart isn't the only one 
that's breaking right now.

63
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:08,308
Come on.

64
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:15,253
There's been an accident.

65
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:17,466
Lucas and haley are in the hospital.

66
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:20,730
It's bad, peyton, it's really bad.

67
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,346
Come on. I'll drive.

68
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:32,632
It's not fair.

69
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,990
Peyton -- All these bad things
 keep happening ther.

70
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:38,353
Good things happen to her, too, luke.

71
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:40,151
Like you.

72
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:42,167
Okay, look, i don't understand this.

73
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:45,029
I mean, what are you, keith? 
An angel?

74
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:46,466
A bad dream?

75
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:49,126
More like a guide.

76
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:50,667
A guide?

77
00:05:51,846 --> 00:05:52,982
To where?

78
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:56,167
Luke, you just had a heart attack.

79
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:58,167
You're not even breathing right now.

80
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,367
So, what -- I'm dead?

81
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:02,367
Not yet.

82
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:03,367
Well, then you --

83
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:06,067
No, i'm dead.

84
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:07,294
Sorry.

85
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:10,411
And what about haley?

86
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:12,783
Haley's not good.

87
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:14,781
Nathan?

88
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,167
What's happening? How's haley?

89
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:23,867
She's being prepped for surgery.

90
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:26,367
She has multiple fractures of the legs, 
some head trauma,

91
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:28,867
Possible collapsed lung, broken ribs,

92
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:30,670
And a good deal of internal bleeding.

93
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:32,318
What about the baby?

94
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:35,285
With this kind of severe trauma...

95
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:38,802
we're gonna do everything that we can.

96
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:42,258
But right now, our priority 
s saving your wife.

97
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,867
So... is she gonna be okay?

98
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:54,367
Is she gonna lose the baby?

99
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:56,080
Well, that hasn't been written yet.

100
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:59,367
You know what? This sucks.

101
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:00,767
All these decent people,

102
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:02,567
And bad things keep happening to them.

103
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:06,193
I mean... you were a good guy, keith.

104
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:07,667
So?

105
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:10,436
So, you got shot for it!

106
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:13,566
Peyton lost both mothers, 
she gets shot and attacked.

107
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,367
Haley's now in surgery.

108
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:16,267
Meaning what?

109
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:19,667
Meaning...what's the point 
of being a good person

110
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:21,135
If this is how it goes?

111
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:27,893
So, you're asking if, 
by being a good person,

112
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:29,657
Have you changed anything?

113
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:31,867
You know, considering apparently

114
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:34,210
I'm lying on my deathbed right now, yes.

115
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,497
Well, let's take a look.

116
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:54,167
Recognize her?

117
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:55,261
No.

118
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:01,089
Is it brooke?

119
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:03,067
What happened to her?

120
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,358
Why don't you go ask her?

121
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:06,713
It's okay. Go on.

122
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:19,670
Hey, brooke?

123
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,014
What's wrong?

124
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:25,818
Get away from me.

125
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:30,663
What's wrong?

126
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:35,088
I said get away from me!

127
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,621
What? What is this?

128
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:43,467
This is the world that would have been

129
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:45,167
If you had led a different life, luke.

130
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,167
What about real life, huh?

131
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:48,745
Real life is still there.

132
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:15,795
Nathan... how's haley?

133
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:17,931
She's in surgery.

134
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:20,667
And lucas?

135
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,412
I don't know.

136
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:25,967
It should have been me.

137
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:27,167
It was all my fault.

138
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,867
No, it wasn't. It was an accident 
-- Like the bridge.

139
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:31,367
No, it wasn't.

140
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:33,767
And now haley's in surgery, 
and even if she makes it,

141
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:36,518
The baby could -- 
She could still lose the baby.

142
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,767
And lucas could die.

143
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:40,248
My dad's in jail.

144
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:42,407
Nathan...

145
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:46,675
i wish i would have died under that water.

146
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:50,074
None of this would have happened.

147
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:42,219
It's ok Nathan

148
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:47,567
Why'd you have to save me, keith?

149
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:49,229
Huh?

150
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:52,367
If i would have died, t
hen there's no daunte,

151
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:54,667
And there's no accident.

152
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:57,026
And haley and the baby are fine.

153
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:03,367
Come on, keith!

154
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:06,168
You can save me,
 but you can't answer me?

155
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:14,478
Thanks for nothing.

156
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:21,723
So, it was you.

157
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:23,550
No, it was him.

158
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,967
Most people are stronger than they know.

159
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:31,546
They just...forget to 
believe in it sometimes.

160
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:34,715
It's my fault.

161
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:38,060
I wanted to win the state championship.

162
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:40,067
I could have let him lose that game.

163
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:42,387
I should have been more 
supportive of him and haley.

164
00:11:43,467 --> 00:11:44,832
Right.

165
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:47,908
Well, let's take another
 look at that world --

166
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:50,733
You know, the one
 where you're a lesser guy.

167
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:53,887
Come on.

168
00:11:58,867 --> 00:12:00,802
Do you have the new haley james album?

169
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:05,072
On vinyl.

170
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:06,867
Nice.

171
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:08,719
Yeah, i got a promo copy right here.

172
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:11,742
You know she's from tree hill?

173
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:14,152
Yeah, i know.

174
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:20,217
I take it you're not a fan.

175
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:26,033
She never went back, luke.

176
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:31,380
I don't believe it.

177
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:34,649
They loved each other.

178
00:12:35,267 --> 00:12:36,667
Yeah, they did.

179
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:39,398
But you never went to new york
to ask her to come back.

180
00:12:40,267 --> 00:12:41,667
That doesn't mean she didn't love him,

181
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:43,567
That they weren't meant to be.

182
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:45,667
But without you, haley stayed out on tour,

183
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:48,183
And by the time she came home,

184
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:52,074
Nathan's pride was just
 too much to overcome.

185
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:54,967
