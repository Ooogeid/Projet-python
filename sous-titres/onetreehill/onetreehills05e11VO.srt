1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,900
Previously on one tree hill

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,400
Rachel.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,200
Owen: rachel?
Rachel, can you hear me?

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,300
I can't be alone again.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,500
You're not gonna be.
You're coming home with me.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,000
Come here.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,200
Lindsey evelyn strauss...

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,700
Will you marry me?

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,100
Go! Carrie, get out
of this bedroom right now.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,800
I have been through a lot
with you, nathan.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,600
I have been through better and
worse, in sickness and health,

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,300
But i will not do infidelity.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,700
It wasn't like that, okay?
I wasn't into her.

14
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,600
You call kissing carrie
and watching her swim naked
not being into her?

15
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,400
I didn't kiss he

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,000
How manyes
do i havdo iell you that?

17
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,500
I can't take it anymore.

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,600
Don't you dare turn this
around on me.

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,300
Jamie!

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,200
Jamie
jamie

21
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,100
Oh, god,
please!

22
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,400
No, you stay away from us!
This marriage is over

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,400
Haley.

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,400
Please, god.

25
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,200
I want --
I want a divorce.

26
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,700
<i>Lucas:

Good morning.

30
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,300
???

31
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,800
Yeah, i know.

32
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,400
If i'd have known
he'd been here a week,

33
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,200
Then i'd clear out
my mom's room.

34
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,200
Have they even seen each other
this week?

35
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,400
Oh, no, i don't even think
they've spoken.

36
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,300
Right.

37
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,100
The last thing i want
haley worrying about

38
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,600
Is throwing
a bachelorette party

39
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,400
When her marriage
is struggling.

40
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,800
You know,
skills could do it.

41
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,800
I mean, he was so excited
about my bachelor party,

42
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,000
He took the week off.

43
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,900
[ Chuckles ]
that worries me.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,300
Oh, yeah.
Me too.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,900
You know,

46
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,300
If a guy like me just happened to have his party
in the same place

47
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,300
A girl like you
happened to have her party...

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,300
Nathan and haley
would have to talk.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,400
Nice.

50
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,200
But they'll never go
for it.

51
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,900
Well, they will,if, um, th

52
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,200
Doow about it!

53
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,800
Oh, you're bad.

54
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,800
You want to be bad with me?

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,200
Oh, you know i do.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,200
Hey, sleepy, what's up?

57
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,500
I saw grandpa.

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,700
When?

59
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,800
Last night...in my dream.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,200
I'm sorry, baby.

61
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,100
We will do a double check

62
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,700
Before
you go to bed tonight, okay?

63
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Look, i made it
with a smiley face.

64
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,800
That's how you like it,
right?

65
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,300
When's daddy coming home?

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,100
I'm sorry, sweetie.
We talked about this.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,700
Probably not for a while.

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,900
And so what were you thinking
about doing for your party?

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,700
'Cause i was thinking it would
be really fun to go old school,

70
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,300
Like jello shots
and '80s music.

71
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,200
Uh, actually,
if it's okay with you,

72
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,200
I was thinking
we'd do something low-Key.

73
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,300
All right.

74
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Just the girls.

75
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,700
Come on, man.
Just the guys.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,800
And lindsey talked to haley

77
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,300
And said she's gonna clear
out of the house.

78
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,000
Really?
Yeah.

79
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,400
All right.
I'll be there.

80
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,700
Thanks, man.

81
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,700
I-I know
you got a lot going on.

82
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,000
I got a lot going on?

83
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,100
Lucas,
i'm living on your couch.

84
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,400
I meant on your mind.

85
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,000
Just the guys, right?

86
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,100
And jamie.

87
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Joint party?

88
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,500
Man, your parents
are messing up everything.

89
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,700
Well, i guess
i got to say goodbye
to the champagne hot tub.

90
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,300
Now what am i gonna do?

91
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,400
I went to a great party
last weekend.

92
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,500
Yeah?

93
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,100
What'd they have?

94
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,900
Cotton candy,

95
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,400
Moon bounce,

96
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,600
Wacky string...

97
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,900
Ooh, and donkey rides.

98
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,800
Yeah?
I had a donkey on my list, too.

99
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,700
All right, luke.
Let me have it.

100
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,900
I deserve it.

101
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,300
Why?

102
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,100
Lindsey didn't tell you
about the library?

103
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,500
Yeah, she told me
tim rescued you,

104
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,800
But you got to admit that story
seems a little farfetched.

105
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,900
If you girls didn't want
to come watch my team play,

106
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,900
You just say so.

107
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,900
[ Scoffs ]
okay, come on.

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,100
She didn't say anything
about how mean i was to her?

109
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
No.
Were you mean to her again?

110
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,300
She's really great, luke.

111
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,500
But it means a lot
to hear you say that.

112
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,300
You and owen didn't hook up
in new york?

113
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,800
Let's just say things
are really good.

114
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,900
What about you and mouth?
How's that going?

115
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,400
Let's just say
things are really good.

116
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,300
He's been so sweet.

117
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,800
Every day
he delivers a treat

118
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,900
And just before he leaves,
a kiss.

119
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's the best part of my day.

120
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,800
Oh, a treat every day.

121
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,500
Two treats,
if you count the kiss.

122
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,500
Oh.

123
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,400
Hi.
Hey.

124
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,400
I got you
a pumpernickel bagel,

125
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,000
And a surprise for you --

126
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,600
Mocha double latte,
extra foam.

127
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,600
I love you.

128
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,500
And i have a bit
of a surprise for u.

129
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,000
Rachel's back.

130
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,100
<i>Rachel rachel?</i>

131
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,800
Owen and i found her
in new york.

132
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,900
She overdosed
in my apartment.

133
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,400
She's been laying loay
at the house for about a week.

134
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Is she okay?

135
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,000
She seems okay today,
but i-

136
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,100
I don't know.
A visit from you would
probably really do her good.

137
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,700
Yeah. Okay.

138
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,000
Bye, milly.

139
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,000
I didn't get my kiss.

140
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:42,800
Hey.

141
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,700
If that's letter number 86 from
the sad box of "lucas summer,"

142
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,400
You can keep it.

143
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,600
Just open it.

144
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,600
Does my store look
like a drug front to you?

145
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,400
It's the start-Up money
you lent me for my label.

146
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,000
I just got paid
for mia's deal.

147
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,700
By who --
A bunch of colombians?

148
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,400
No, but cash is just more fun.
It's more dramatic.

149
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,500
Peyton, is is way more money
than i lent you.

150
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,100
It's twice as much,
actually.

151
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,500
It looks like you're
a very smart investor.

152
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Well...
so, what's going on?

153
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,900
Brooke?

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,400
It's amazing.

155
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,700
Hey, lindsey.
Hi.

156
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,800
Hi.

157
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
You make
a very beautiful bride.

158
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,200
Thank you, peyton.

159
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,300
And thank you, brooke.
It's perfect!

160
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,000
<i>It is perfect.</i>

161
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,900
Oh, uh, hey,
so, lucas and i

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,700
Decided to combine our
bachelor/bachelorette parties

163
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Tonight at haley's.

164
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,800
Wow.

165
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,800
Have nathan and haley
even talked

166
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,700
Since nate went all jude law
with the hot nanny?

167
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,400
Didn't we warn her?
Yeah.

168
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,400
Uh, no,
they're not speaking.

169
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,600
Okay, so, how...

170
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,600
Um, we lied.

171
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,200
Oh, that's good.

172
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,700
Got to start somewhere,
right?

173
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,100
Okay, wacky string --

174
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,600
10 cans, jam master j.

175
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,000
Is daddy going to be
at the party?

176
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,800
Mm-Hmm.

177
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
And mommy, too?

178
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,000
Yep.

179
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,700
But, look, you can't tell
mommy or daddy, okay?

180
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,000
Can we play "rock band"
at the party?

181
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,800
Hmm.
Good idea, kid.

182
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,700
Man, you got this party thing
down, hugh hefner.

183
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,000
Come on.

184
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,500
Man, who knew
that old boxers

185
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,700
Would take over
the mini-Grill industry, huh?

186
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,600
So, anything else
on the wish list?

187
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,500
Uh, you see the bar code
for your next book?

188
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,900
I got to give them something,
luke.

189
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,400
I know.
I know, i know, i know.

190
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,400
Let me give it one more pass,
and then you got it, okay?

191
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Thank you.

192
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,500
Oh, pda in the mall
is so 7th grade.

193
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,700
Owen, kiss me.
They're doing it.

194
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,200
So is
peer pressure.

195
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,300
What's going on?

196
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,000
Oh, nothing.

197
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,200
Just killing some time
before my big meeting.

198
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,600
O...m...g!

199
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,600
Brooke? Lucas?

200
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,300
[ Cheering ]
r-A-V-E-N-S!

201
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,200
Go, ravens!

202
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,300
Hi...bevin.

203
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,300
What's up?!

204
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,300
Nothing.
We're just...
oh, i'm great, thanks.

205
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,300
So, after i graduated
four years ago,

206
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,300
I got a job,

207
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,200
And i got married,
and i had a little boy.

208
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh.

209
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,000
Isn't he cute?
His name is nathan.

210
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,700
Wow, lucas.
You're marrying brooke?

211
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,100
Huh. I always thought
ghyou'd marry peyton.

212
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,800
No, uh --
So, have you heard
from rachel?

213
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,100
That's a nice spot, huh?

214
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,800
Yeah.

215
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,500
How you feeling today?

216
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,400
Honestly,
i'm a little bit ashamed.

217
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,800
You and brooke
don't have to babysit me.

218
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,200
Don't be too hard on yourself,
okay?

219
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,700
I know i can beat this.

220
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,400
I just got so deep in it,
i forgot which way was up.

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,400
The light is always up.

222
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,600
When i first came back home,
i really didn't know
what i wanted.

223
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
And brooke believed in me,

224
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,000
And today it felt really,
really good to prove her right.

225
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,100
She believes in you, too,
you know.

226
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
I know.

227
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,000
And i'm gonna make it up
to her.

228
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,600
How's rachel doing?

229
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,100
Really well, actually.

230
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,400
It's been hard on her,
you know,

231
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,400
And so gross.

232
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,900
But i think she's strong enough
to stay sober.
I really do.

233
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I hope so, brooke.

234
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,600
You know, i know
i was a little opinionated
about how you fired rachel,but...

235
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,800
I think i was just
projecting, you know?

236
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,400
It's really great
you're trying to help her now.

237
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,800
Well, i'm not helping her
'cause i fired her.

238
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,500
I'm helping her
'cause she needs it.

239
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Oh.

240
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,800
Hello, darllng.

241
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,100
Hi.

242
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm confused.

243
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,300
Of course you are.

244
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,000
The meeting
was moved forward.

245
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,400
Not to worry --
Your input wasn't needed.

246
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,200
But this was my meeting.

247
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,200
It was just business talk --
Way over your head.

248
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,700
You wouldn't have understood.

249
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,800
So, where have you been hiding
yourself all week, anyway?

250
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,500
I've been finishing
a wedding dress

251
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,400
And handling
some personal things.

252
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,900
Well, good.
You can get back to it.

253
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,400
You're dismissed.

254
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,000
Go play.
It's what you do best.

255
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,600
Babe, you shouldn't put up
with that.

256
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,400
I know she's your mom,

257
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,600
But you can't be partners
with somebody
that treats you like that.

258
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,800
Okay, i thought
you were working
on the whole
"opinionated" thing.

259
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,000
Hey, hey, hey.
Where's my kiss?

260
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,000
Okay.

261
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,900
Careful what you ask for,
i guess.

262
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,100
How's he doing?

263
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,600
He's okay.
You know.

264
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,900
I think he's over hating me,
but i'm still the bad guy.

265
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,500
Well, when he files
for emancipation,
then you can worry.

266
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,900
How are
you and lindsey doing?
You guys
ready for the big day?

267
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,500
Well, not a lot of time.

268
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
She wants my new pages first.

269
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,700
I'm just not sure
they're quite there.

270
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,600
Well, if you need
an extra set of eyes,

271
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,300
I will be happy to help.

272
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,700
You would?
Yes, of course.

273
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,100
I was your first editor.

274
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,900
If i don't like it,
don't hate me.

275
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,000
Okay, don't hate me,

276
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,800
But you have a date
to the party tonight.

277
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,100
One of owen's friends
is in town.

278
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,900
Supposedly he's supercute.
He's coming out with us tonight.

279
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,900
I told him
you were gonna be there.

280
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Blind double date?

281
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,800
Only half blind.

282
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,900
Say yes because
it's the peyton i know and love

283
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And because,
if you show up with a date,

284
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,200
You are gonna look classy
and over it.

285
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,000
Okay.

286
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,700
I will go get ready.
But he better be cute.

287
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,500
I'd invite you...

288
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,700
Yeah, but detox and parties
don't mix.

289
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah. But we're gonna come back early.

290
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,100
I promise.

291
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,200
Look, uh, i was talking
to peyton today

292
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,000
About how you helped her out
with her business.

293
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,900
And, i don't know,
i'm feeling really good now

294
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,000
And supermotivated
to get back to work.

295
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,400
And yesterday, you know,

296
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,300
You said that
maybe i could start modeling
for clothes over bro's again.

297
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,800
So, i was just wondering...

298
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,700
Right.

299
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,600
Rachel, i love you,

300
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,200
But i meant
maybe a job at the store.

301
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,600
You know, like, you could learn
the retail side

302
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,800
And work your way
back up.

303
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,400
Oh.

304
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,000
I see. Yeah.

305
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Hey.

306
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,100
I didn't mean
to get your hopes up.

307
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,500
You're one
of my best friends,

308
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
And you're
an incredible model.

309
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,300
But it's that lifestyle,
you know?

310
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,000
You can't be around that.

311
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,700
Not yet.

312
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,900
Yeah, i know.

313
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,200
Look, i feel like
i let you down once before,

314
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,300
And i can't do that again.

315
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,800
Brooke, that was not your fault,
all right?

316
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,900
That was me.

317
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,800
I am not gonna make
those same mistakes again.

318
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,300
I'm strong.
You said so.

319
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,800
Yeah.

320
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,700
So, let's just give it
time, okay?

321
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,800
Baby steps.

322
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,100
Sure.

323
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,800
Okay.

324
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,000
New basketball
for your son?

325
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,700
Actually,
it's for my grandson.

326
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,300
Wow.
I never would have guessed.

327
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,300
You keep yourself
in great shapeee

328
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,100
I had a lot of spare time
on my hands.

329
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,700
So, patty...

330
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,200
What time do you get off?

331
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,400
Well, that depends.

332
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
What time
are you gonna pick me upck

333
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,300
Hey.
Hey.

334
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,800
You look nice.
Thanks.

335
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,500
I'm just, uh, getting ready
for lucas and lindsey's party.

336
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,400
After you go see rachel?

337
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,300
I was thinking about it.
Why?

338
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,400
Mouth,

339
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,400
Rachel once had me
guard the women's bathroom

340
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,000
At bungalow 8 while she did
things...

341
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,200
With a guy

342
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,200
Or two.

343
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,300
I know what she's about.

344
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,100
I also know that you and rachel
have history.

345
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,500
Listen, rachel's friend
who's going through a hard time,

346
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,300
I just want
to support her.

347
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,400
I mean, i'd bring you along

348
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,700
If i didn't think it was
insensitive to her condition.

349
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,900
Rachel's never been sensitive
to anyone's condition
but her own.

350
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,000
Well, you don't know her
like i do.

351
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,300
I know.

352
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,900
That's what i'm afraid of.

353
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,600
Look, millicent --
It's okay, mouth.
Just go.

354
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,600
I'll see you at the party.

355
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,000
So, look, nate,
um,

356
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,200
About this party --

357
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,200
???

358
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,200
Haley's inside.

359
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,300
I figured.

360
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,800
You did?
Yeah.

361
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,400
You always meddle, luke.

362
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,300
It's what you do.

363
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,000
You're just lucky
i miss my wife.

364
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,500
You believe this?

365
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,800
Ringing the bell
at my own house.

366
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,900
[ Doorbell rings ]
they're here.

367
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,200
Hi, owen.
Hey.

368
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,800
Hi...

369
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,300
Chase?

370
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Brooke.

371
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,500
Hi.

372
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,200
It's chase.

373
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,200
Like,
"clean teen" chase?
Uh-Huh.

374
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,700
Oh, my god.
This is getting so good.

375
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,900
Are you sure
you don't want in?

376
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,100
Uh, i'm barely clean
and hardly a teen.

377
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,700
Team, help me.

378
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,400
Owen never told me
his friend's name.

379
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,000
What am i supposed to do?

380
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,400
So what?
I mean, do you want to bail?

381
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,600
No.

382
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
I mean...

383
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,100
No. It's fine.

384
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,600
I'm with owen.
I haven't talked to chase
in years, but...

385
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,000
Chase really is so cute.

386
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,500
Are you two enjoying this?

387
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,900
Uh, well, yeah,
a little.

388
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,700
Okay.

389
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,800
If you hook up with chase,
for the record,

390
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,300
You're taking a cab home.

391
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Okay.

392
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Well, you're paying.
Fine.

393
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,700
Seriously,

394
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,700
If it gets awkward,
just say the word, okay?

395
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,600
Okay.

396
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,100
Awkward.

397
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,200
What?

398
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,600
Nothing.

399
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,100
Okay, does somebody want
to tell me what's going on?

400
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,500
Hey, bud...

401
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,100
You remember that girl
i used to tell you about

402
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,600
Back when we first
moved in together?

403
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,700
Yeah, the one
you constantly talked about?

404
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,400
Not constantly,
but yeah.

405
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,100
What, the fake virgin chick
you lost your virginity to?

406
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Chick?
Yeah.

407
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,700
What about her?

408
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,000
Do you remember her name?

409
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,700
Come on!

410
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,000
Haley...

411
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,900
I'm sorry, all right?
This was not my idea.

412
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,400
Um, i can go
if you want me to.

413
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,200
No. You should stay.

414
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,700
We need to talk anyway.
Yeah.

415
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,800
Daddy!
There he is!

416
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,000
Can we play "rock band" --
Me, you, and mommy?

417
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,100
Yeah, sure, we can.

418
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,800
I-I'm a little busy right now,
sweetie.

419
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,800
Sorry.
We'll talk later.

420
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,100
You should play with him.

421
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,400
He misses you.

422
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,700
Was that cotton candy?

423
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,900
Nice.

424
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,000
Man, i don't know
how i never put it together.

425
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,900
Sobriety must be going
to my head.

426
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,400
I never put it together
either.

427
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,400
You said, "brooke."
I said, "brooke."

428
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,900
Yeah, but you said, "brooke
that started a fashion line."

429
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,500
Yeah, yeah, you probably should
have figured that one out.

430
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,800
Yeah.

431
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,400
Dude, stop smiling.

432
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,400
You, uh,
got a little something.

433
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,000
Oh. Oh, i got it.

434
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,700
Sorry.

435
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,000
Just, uh, thought you were
actually happy to see me.

436
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,400
I am happy to see you.
Mommy! Daddy!

437
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Let's play "rock band."

438
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,000
Not right now, sweetie.

439
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,500
I am happy to see you.

440
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,600
It's just tonight's about lucas
and lindsey and not us and --

441
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,500
Yes, jamie. What?

442
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,000
I want to play "rock band."

443
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,800
Well,
go play, then, sweetie.

444
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,100
Go on.

445
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,700
[ Sighs ]
i meant all of us.

446
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
I know.

447
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,900
Maybe later, okay?

448
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:39,000
Come on, jimmy jam.
I'll rock with you.

449
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,100
It's okay.
Maybe later.

450
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,200
My, uh --
My college roommate

451
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,000
<i>Actually spent $6 on vogue for
your clothes over bro's layout.</i>

452
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,900
Your roommate, huh?

453
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,500
Well, it's all been downhill
from there.

454
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,600
Hey, coming out
of high school,

455
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,500
We all want to rule the world,
but

456
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
It's tough.

457
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,400
I basically had to sleep
with my boss to keep my job.

458
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,700
Well, you've come
a long way, mouth.

459
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,700
I'd probably still have my job
if brooke had that rule.

460
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,000
I got to say, man,

461
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,300
I'm a little jealous
of everyone's success.

462
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,100
Why didn't you ever call me?

463
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,900
I would have helped you.

464
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,700
I know.

465
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
That's why i didn't.

466
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,200
Well, is there anything
i can do for you now, rachel?

467
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Anything?

468
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,600
Sure.

469
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,500
Well, you remember
that motel room at honeygrove?

470
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,600
I could really use
the release, mouth.

471
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,200
A little natural high.
Rachel, i --

472
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,000
Come on.
You slept with your boss.

473
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,300
How about a module?

474
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,300
I can't.

475
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm sorry.

476
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,100
I-I must look terrible.

477
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,400
Don't.
You're beautiful.

478
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,200
And you could have whoever
you want and whatever you want.

479
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,200
But?

480
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,100
But you don't believe that.

481
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,600
You need to learn
to let go of whatever it is

482
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,300
That makes you think
you're not good enough.

483
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,300
'Cause that's
when you're gonna beat this --

484
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,800
When you learn
that you matter.

485
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
I should go.

486
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,400
(Karl)

487
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,800
(We are parting in south beach.
Get your hot ass down here)

488
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Can we come in?

489
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,300
What you got there,
little man?

490
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,100
Nothing.

491
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,800
That's more than nothing.

492
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,400
Those are the two people who
love you the most in the world.

493
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,700
Almost as much as i do.

494
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,100
Is he your boyfriend?

495
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,900
You're the only boyfriend
in my life.

496
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,300
Owen: hey.

497
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,100
I heard i owe you one.

498
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,000
You got me another chance
with brooke.

499
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,600
"What's under all the clothes,
brooke davis?"

500
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,200
So, you find out?

501
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,300
On that note,
boy time is over.

502
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,500
Let's go.

503
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,600
Give me knuckles.

504
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,900
Hey.

505
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,400
Look, i hope you don't feel
too slighted by the setup.

506
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
To be honest, i kind of
expected it from you guys --

507
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,400
"You" being, uh...

508
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
You and lindsey.

509
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,600
Your hearts were
in the right place, though.

510
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,700
You picked the right person
to spend the rest
of your life with, luke.

511
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,900
So did you.

512
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,500
So, this is
kind of weird, huh?

513
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,100
Then again, i did find you
pretty cute back in high school.

514
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,000
Oh, god, come on.

515
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,100
I did.

516
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,400
But i was with brooke.

517
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,200
And you re with lucas.

518
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
You still love him?

519
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,700
He's with lindsey now.

520
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,000
Chase, i --

521
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,400
3:00.

522
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,100
Lucas was looking.

523
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,100
Just trying
to help you out.

524
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,400
Hey.
Did i miss all the fun?

525
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,100
I guess not.

526
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,100
When i was a little girl,

527
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,500
I sprayed the boys i liked most
with wacky string.

528
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,700
But then todd pinkerton
got some in his mouth,

529
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,900
And he started to cry.

530
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,700
Needless to say,
i abandoned that tactic.

531
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,400
I really like you, marvin.

532
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,900
So the next time you go to visit
some really hot former model

533
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,800
Who you have some sort of
sexual history with

534
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,800
And who's
in a vulnerable state...

535
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,200
Just consider me.

536
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,300
You're right.

537
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,200
I can do that.

538
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,700
So, i built it up so much.

539
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,500
I told all these kids

540
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,900
That my mom was gonna get me
this cake with rambo on it --

541
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,100
Like, chest scars, flames,
you know?

542
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,000
My mom brings the cake out,

543
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,000
And
instead of a picture of rambo,

544
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,700
It's like
this dinky homemade cake.

545
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,700
No rambo -- Ju t -Ords
"rambo says 'happy birthday'"

546
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,400
Scribbled across the top.

547
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,300
So embarrassing.

548
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,700
I thought it was funny, but
if you have a better story...

549
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
No, your mom sounds sweet.

550
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,900
On the rare occasion
that my mother

551
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,100
Ever actually remembered
my birthday,

552
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,000
She'd just toss her gold card
at me

553
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,500
And tell me
to go buy something.

554
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,900
She never really cared
to get involved.

555
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
She's not exactly
the nurturing type.

556
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,300
Hey, junkie.
Get up.

557
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,500
You and peyton
are like bloodsucking vermin

558
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,500
That just won't go away.

559
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,500
Where's my daughter?

560
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,900
She's at a party.

561
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,500
[ Scoffs ]
of course she is.

562
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,300
And when she's not partying
with the bartender,

563
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,500
She's running a halfway house,
apparently.

564
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,100
I'not a --

565
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,300
I'm better now.

566
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,200
Yeah.

567
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,600
Whatever.

568
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,500
Today you're fine.

569
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,500
Tomorrow you'll have pawned
my pradas.

570
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,100
It's different this time.

571
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,000
Brooke believes in me.

572
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,300
Oh, well,
look out, tony robbins,

573
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,900
Here comes my daughter.

574
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,600
You know, i convinced her
to cut you loose once.

575
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,300
I can do it again.

576
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,100
Brooke wouldn't do that to me.

577
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,500
No?

578
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,300
Look at you.

579
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,400
You're pathetic.

580
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,400
And the sad thing is,
you're gonna lie to yourself

581
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,200
Long enough to hurt the people
who still give a damn.

582
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,600
Why don't you think of them
before you relapse

583
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,600
And waste all their time
and their money?

584
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,400
I mean, let's be honest.

585
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,700
You can't beat this thing.

586
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,900
And deep down inside...

587
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,800
You know it, too.

588
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,000
Don't you?

589
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,700
No! No! No! No! No!

00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,800
Get him! Get him!
Get him! Get him! Get hi

Boom..

Guys, can you take it easy,
please?

593
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,900
Be careful.
Come on, sweetie.

594
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,700
It's time to go.

595
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,200
But, mom...
it's getting late.

596

You got to go to bed soon,
all right?

597
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,500
You got
to remembe rhis size.

598
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,700
You treat him like
one of the guys, but
he's just a little boy.

599
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,500
Look, haley,
i don't want to disres,

600
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,100
'Cause i know you and nathan
going through some things
right now.

601
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,200
But i never lost sight
on how little that boy is.

602
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,400
Actually, i'm amazed
how little he is

603
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,800
Because his heart is so big.

604
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,500
You knowyo
today all he wanted to do

605
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,700
Was make sure y'all
was a whole family again.

606
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,200
That's what today
meant to him.

607
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,400
And if you hadn't noticed,

608
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,300
I just think
y'all are the ones
that done lost sight of things.

609
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,200
I can't believe
we're getting married.

610
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,700
Yep.

611
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,600
And after the wedding, you'll be
another scott in tree hill.

612
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,200
You think
you can handle that?

613
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,900
Uh, who said
i was taking your last name?

614
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,800
So, how's our little plan
working out?

615
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,400
Uh, they're talking.

616
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,200
That's a start, right?

617
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,400
Look, i just wanted to say
i'm sorry.

618
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,000
Aren't you tired of that?

619
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,900
You shouldn't have to apologize
for who you are.
Not anymore.

620
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,200
I've been thinking a lot
this week.

621
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,600
And i knew who you were
when i married you,

622
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,900
And what i've realized
is that it's really not fair.

623
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,400
What are you saying?

624
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,300
I'm saying
that it was wrong of me...

625
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,500
To try and change you.

626
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,400
I'm the one who's sorry.

627
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,000
I shouldn't have tried
to change you or us.

628
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,400
And now...

629
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,000
Now...

630
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,400

with the party, man.

Sure.

634

The moon bounce
was the bomb,

635
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,100
And the cotton candy
was off the chain.

But that's
where i draw the line.

This pet don't scare you.
He doesn't bite.

Or were you
just stealing wallets?

Well, they call it
winona syndrome
when you have everything

649

And you resort to petty theft
for the cheap thrill.

650

sounds pretty thrilling.

[ Laughs ]

663
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,300
Suppose keith and my dad

664
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,900
Were sitting next to each other
at a bar in heaven.

665
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,300
What do you think
they'd talk about?

666
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,600
Well, after they
had a beer...

667
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,600
I think keith would take
a long, hard look at your dad

668
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,000

"Where's the bathroom?@U

Would have been
best friends.

00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,900
And keith would tell him
what a great job he did
raising his daughter.

Because he did.

you abandoned that tactic.

i'd take the risk.

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,900
What's your story?

710
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,700
I just got out of jail
for killing my brother.

711
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,300
Right.

712
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,700
So, did you do it?

713
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,600
Yeah.

714
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,900
I saw the light on.
I wanted to make sure that

715
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,100
Rachel wasn't cleaning us out.

716
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,900
What is that supposed
to mean?

717
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,600
Have you been to my house?

718
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,600
Did you say something
to her?

719
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,400
Nothing the mirror
couldn't have told her.

720
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,600
Leave my friends alone,
okay?

721
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,100
I was trying to protect you
from making another mistake.

722
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,700
Firing rachel was a mistake.

723
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,900
That was business.

724
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,400
That is not the way
i want my business to be.

725
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,100
People deserve better.
She --

726
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,000
You see?

727
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,400
This is exactly why you weren't
included in the meeting today.

728
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,700
You're too emotional.

729
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,600
You need to remove emotion
from business.

730
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,300
That's why i'm here.

731
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,700
Now.

732
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,200
You're here now.

733
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,900
What about all of those years
i was growing up?

734
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,300
You never wanted to be
a part of my life

735
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,300
Until i started
this company.

736
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,600
What?

737
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,300
Cheerleading,

738
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,900
School president...

739
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,700
Stop being childish.

740
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,400
You're the face of a company,

741
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,500
And you took your company
as far as you could on your own.

742
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,400
Then you came to me
when you needed help.

743
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,700
Well, rachel needed my help.

744
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
And you made me fire her.

745
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,200
You earned my help, brooke.

746
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,400
Rachel didn't earn yours.

747
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,900
I earned it?

748
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,600
A daughter is not
supposed to have to earn

749
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,000
Her mother's help...

750
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,300
Or her love.
It is supposed to be
unconditional.

751
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,200
Whatever.

752
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,800
You'reired.

753
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,200
What did you just say?

754
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,200
I said...

755
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,500
You...are fired.

756
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,800
You're going to fire me

757
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,200
And risk our entire company?

758
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,400
But it's not our company.

759
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,400
It's my company.

760
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,000
Remember?

761
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,300
I am not an employee.

762
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,200
I am your mother.

763
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,300
I know.

764
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,100
You're fired.

765
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,500
You can go now.

766
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,500
<i>Albert camus once wrote,</i>

767
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,400

769
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,300
<i>But i wonder...</i>

770
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,100
<i>If there's no breaking,

771
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,900
<i>And if there's no healing,</i>

772
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,400
<i>Then there's no learning.</i>

773
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,400
<i>And if there's no learning...</i>

774
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,400
<i>Then there's no struggle.</i>

775
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,100
<i>But the struggle
is a part of life,</i>

776
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,700
Hey.

777
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Hi.

778
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,100
I need to talk to you.

779
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,800
Sure.
Is everything okay?

780
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,000
<i>So must all hearts be broken?</i>

781
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,400
No.

782
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,200
You can't marry lindsey.
