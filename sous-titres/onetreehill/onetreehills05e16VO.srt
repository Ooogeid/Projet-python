3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,900
but I'd Like To Be
A Good Grandthther.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,800
Well, You Should Have
Thought Of That Before You
Killed Jamie's Gre-U-Uncle.

5
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,600
I Passed
On The Omaha Job.

6
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,800
Marvin!

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,700
I Feel Like I'm Good
At What I Do, Millicent,

8
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,300
And I'll Just Work Hard

9
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,300
And Hope The Station
Gives Me Another Shot.

10
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,600
Are You Sure?

11
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,000
That I'm Doing The Right Thing?
I Don't Know.

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,500
But About Us?
Yeah, I'm Sure.

13
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,400
I Trusted You,
All Right?

14
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,900
Quentin,
You Needed This.
I Needed <I>This?!</I>

15
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,800
You Know What?!
I Needed A Scholarship!

16
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,000
I Needed You
To Keep Your Mouth Shut!

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,400
That's What I Needed!

18
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,500
Millicent...
They're Giving Me A Baby.

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,100
Lindsey, I Love You.

20
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,300
I Love You, Too, Luke,

21
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,500
But It Takes More Than Love
To Build A Marriage.

22
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,200
I'm Willing To Learn.

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
This Is For You.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,600
You're Giving Me
The Beach House?

25
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,300
I Don't Want It.

26
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,100
Son.

27
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,500

With Grandpa Dan?

44
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,900
What Do You Mean?

45
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,800
He Didn't Come
To My Birthday Party.

46
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,600
Everyone Else Came.

47
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,000
I Really Wanted Him
To Come.

48
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,600
Yeah, I Know You Did,
Buddy.

49
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,400
But Your Party Was Still
Pretty Cool, Right?

50
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,600
Yeah, But Grandpa Dan Said
He Missed Me.

51
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,100
Well, You Know That Old Jersey
That Youovove So Much?

52
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,200
That Was
From Your Grandpa Dan.

53
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,700
Really?!
I Knew It!

54
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,200
Hey!
Hey.

55
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,700
Mama, Grandpa Dan Got Me
This Birthday Present.

56
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,300
Wow!

57
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,500
Can I Talk To You
For A Second?

58
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,000
He's Dying, Hales.

59
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,000
What?!
Dan Needs
A Heart Transplant.

60
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,700
He Says It's His Hcm.

61
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Hehe's Got Six Months To Live,
Maybe Not Even That.

62
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,600
Do You Believe Him?
He's Not Even That Old.

63
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,900
I Don't Know.
I Mean, It's Dan.

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But He's Even
Drawn Up A Will,

65
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,400
And He's Leaving Us The
Beach House, Among Other Things.

66
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,000
And This Time,
He Seeme....Scared.

67
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,200
I Mean, I've Seen My Father
Be A Lot Of Things, Hales,

68
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,200
But Never Scared.

69
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,699
Well, If It <I>Is</I> True,
At Least Now We Know

70
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,200
Why He Wants To Spend
So Much Time With Jamie.

71
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,000
Nothing Like
A Ticking Clock.

72
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,800
Well,
Ticking Clock Or Not,

73
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,500
Dan's Not Spending Any Time
With Jamie.

74
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,100
Brooke: Come On, Baby Girl.
Give Me A Smile.

75
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,300
Well, Fine, Have It Your Way,

76
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,500
But We Got A Big Week
Ahead Of Us, Kid.

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,200
Tonight We'll Me T The Doctor
Who's Gonna Make You All Better,

78
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,200
And Tomorrow Aunt Millicent's
Goa A Watch You

79
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,900
While I Go To My Superduper
Important Meeting.

80
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,100
Yeah.

81
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Are You Gonna Be Okay
Without Me?

82
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,200
It's Open!

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,700
Hey, What Are You
Doing Here?

84
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,900
Diyoyou Think I Was Gonna Forget
Something This Important?

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,500
7:00, Right?

86
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,800
Yeah, 7:00 <I>P.M.</I>

87
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,650
But I Appreciate
The Enthusiasm, Luke.

88
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,100
I Am Kind Of Nervous
About The Whole Hospital Thing.

89
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,650
I'm Not Really
A Big Fan Of Hospitals.

90
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,300
How's It Going?
Better?

91
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,100
Yeah.
I'm Starting To Get It Down.

92
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,800
She's Sleeping
Through The Night Now.

93
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,500
See? I Told You
You'd Be A Good Mom.

94
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,400
Is It What You Expected?

95
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,200
It's A Lot Of Work --

96
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
A Lot More Than I Ever
Thought It Could Be.

97
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,300
But She's So Cute!

98
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,100
Oh, God, That Was, Like,
The Best Night's Sleep Ever!

99
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,000
Luke, Hey.
What Are You Doing Here?

100
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,400
He Just Came By
For Angie's Pre-Op Appointment.

101
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Talk About A Gentleman.

102
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,100
Probably Should Have
Just Called.

103
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,550
Brooke,
I'll Pick You Up Later.

104
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,300
Sounds Good.

105
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,900
Bye, Luke!

106
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,200
Yotwtwo.

107
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,700
God.

108
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,250
They're Silly.
Aren't They Silly?!

109
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,200
He Knew There Was Practice
This Morning, Right?

110
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,800
I Told Him.

111
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,900
Bring It In.

112
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,200
So, As You Can All See,
Q.'S Out For Six Weeks,

113
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,900
Which Means
We're Gonna Have To Make It To The Playoffs
Without Him.

114
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,000
Every Single One Of You
Is Gonna Have To Step It Up.

115
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,800
Now, There's 12 Games
Between Now And The Playoffs,

116
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,100
And We Can't Afford
To Lose Many.

117
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,900
Any Questions?

118
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,900
Hey, Just Because
Quentin's S Injured

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,900
Doesn't Mean
The Season's Over.

120

It's Okay.
You Are Excused From Baby Duty.

133
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,900
Besides...

134
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,700
I Kind Of Like Having
The Time Alone With Angie,

135
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,200

I Mean, It Is Pretty Great
That He's Helping Out.

142
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,900
It's Kind Of "Mr. Mom,"
But It's Nice.

143
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,400
And Anyway, He's Still

145
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,700
Speaking Of Distractions,

146
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,200

Listen, I Know We Haven't Spoken Much 
Since I Took Over For Alice...

166
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,000
And I Know
You Were Close With Her.

167
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,100
Um, Pretty Close,
Yeah.

168
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,200

170
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Really?

171
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,100
Uh, What About
The Weekend Guy?
He O Okay.

172
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
But Then How Would You
Get Your Big Shot?

173
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,900
I Got Three Slots --
4:00, 5:00, An6:6:00.

174
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,100
I Need You To Do Sports
For All Three.

175
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,600
Yes, Sir.
Thank You, Sir.

176
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,900
Oh, And, Uh,Ararvin,
I Heard About Your Omaha Offer.

177
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,400
I Think You Made
The Right Decision.

178
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Sweet!

179
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,700
Luke,
Do You Have A Second?

180
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,400
It's Dan.

181
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,600
He's Dying.

182
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,300
Right.

183
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,400
I'm Serious.
It's Something About His Heart.

184
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,900
He Had Nathan Out
To The Beach House To Tell Him.

185
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,100
And Nathan Believes Him?
I Thinsoso.

186
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,550
At Least, He Seemed
Prpretty Convinced.

187
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Dan Drafted Up Ailill
And Everything.

188
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,700
Why?
You Think He's Lying?

189
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,600
Of Course He's Lying!

190
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,900
All Right,
I-I'll Get Into It, Ayay?

191
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,800
But In The Meantime,
Be Careful.

192
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
All Right?

193
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't Let Him Suck You
And Nathan Back Into His Life.

194
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,200
I Know.
I'm With You On That.

195
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
But What If He's
Telling The Truth?

196
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,000
What If He
Really Is Dying?

197
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,700
Well, Then,
All I Have To Say Is...

198
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,400
It Couldn't Happen
To A Nicer Guy.

199
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,500
You'll Get It Back Again,
Trust Me.

200
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,200
What Are You Doing Here?

201
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,500
You Told Me In The Gym
You Weren't Trying To Come Back,

202
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,600
And I Know You Are --
It's What I Would Do.

203
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,100
It's Not A Comeback.
Sure.

204
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,900
You Know, Nathan, You May
Just Have To Face The Fact

205
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,000
That You'll Never Be
The Same Playeyoyou Once Were,

206
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,300
But That Doesn't Mean You
Still Won't Be A Great Player.

207
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,100
You Just Have To Learn
How To Play Diffenently --

208
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,300
Revevent Yourself.

209
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,300
The Best Players
Always Find A Way.

210
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,100
Okay, Try It Again,
But Slow It Down A Tad.
Stop It!

211
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,200
Stop What?

212
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Following Me.
Trying To See Jamie.

213
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,400
This -- All Of It.

214
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,500
Dan, I Don't Care
That You're Dying, Okay?

215
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,900
This Isn't Happening.

216
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,600
We're Done Here.

217
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,900
Nathan, Don't Hate Me
Because I'm Proud Of Your Accomplishments.

218
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,200
Take It From Someone
Who Knows.

219
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,500
You Don't Want To Live
A Life Of Regret.

220
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,000
It's Not Too Late.
You Can Have Your Dream.

221
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,800
You Just Have
To Really Want It.

222
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,300
Stop It!

223
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,900
Okay, You Don't Get It,
Do You?!

224
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,900
Justtotop It --
All Of It!

225
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,300
And Leave
My Family Alone!

226
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,900
Oh, There!
Check It Out.

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,700
How Awesome Is This, Haley?
It's Red Bedroom Studios.

228
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,400
Yeah, It's Great.

229
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,100
Hey.

230
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,000
What G Going On
With You?

231
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,100
Nothing. I'm Fine.
It's Just, Um...Nothing.

232
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,600
The Studio Looks Awesome.

233
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,500
So, What Is It?

234
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,800
Can I Just Ask You
A Personal Question?

235
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,700
Yeah, Please Do.

236
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,100
If Y H Had The Chance
To Get To Know Your Real Father,

237
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,800
Would You Want To?

238
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,800
Oh, Wow.
I Mean, You Know What?

239
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,300
Before Ellie, I Probably
Would Have Said No,

240
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,000
But She Was Awesome.

241
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,800
And, So, Yeah, It Does Make Me Kind Of Wonder About My Real Dad Sometimes.

242
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,800
But...
You Know, Then Again,

243
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,600
What If I Meet Him
And I Don't Like Him?

244
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,300
So, Sometimes I Think
It's Just Easier Not To Know

245
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,200
And Go With My Own
Idealized Version Of Him.

246
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Yeah.

247
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,800
Why Do You Ask?

248
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,800
The'e's A Chance
Dan Might Be Dying.

249
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,100
Are You Kidding?

250
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,000
Does Nhahan Know?

251
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,400
Yeah, Nathan And Lucas
Both Know.

252
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,300
The Problem Is With Jamie.

253
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,700
He Is Obsessed With
Getting To Know His Grandfather,

254
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,100
And If Dan's Really Sick,

255
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,400
He Might Not Get The Chance
To Do That.

256
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,600
God, Haley. I'm Sorry.
That's Tough, N.N.

257
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,500
Um...I Mean, I Will Say

258
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,200
That Getting To Know Ellie
Changed My Life.

259
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,300
And I'm Pretty Sure
We Wouldn't Be Standing Here
If It Weren't Foheher.

260
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,900
Then Again,
Ellie Wasn't D S Scott.

261
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,800
Well, You <I>Look</I> Healthy.

262
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,500
Come On In, Lucas.

263
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,000
Have A Seat.

264
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,500
Nah, That's Okay.What Iavave To Say
I Can Say From Right Here.

265
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Well, Suit Yourself.

266
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,800
But You Of All Peopie
Should Take This Seriously.

267
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,100
There's Nothing Wrong
With My Heart.

268
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,000
If I Know You, There's Nothing
Wrong With Yours, Either.

269
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,800
I Wish That Was True.

270
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,700
But I've Got The Best
Cardiologist Money Can Buy,

271
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,600
And Even He Can't Help Me.

272
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,000
Dr. Thorton --
Call Him Yourself.

273
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,800
I Might Just Do That.
Good.

274
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,600
And When You Do, You'll Find Out
That I'm Not Lying.

275
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,900
Withoua A Transplant,
I'll Be Dead Within Six Months.

276
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,200
But You're Dead
To So Many Of Us Already, Dan.

277
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,900
so really, ??? matter?

278
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,500
So, Do You Want To Put Down
The Piano Scratch Track First?

279
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,200
Yeah, That's Perfect.

280
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Hey!

281
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,700
Who Would Have Thought
That One Day

282
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,000
We'd Be In Our Own
Recording Studio

283
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,500
Making Your Next Record
Together?

284
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,400
On <I>Your</I> Label.

285
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,300
It's Great That You're
Really Enjoying Your
Work So Much, Peyton.

286
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,000
Just As Long As Yorere Not
Using It To Hide Behind.

287
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,000
[ Laughing ]
What's That Supposed To Mean?

288
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,600
Look,
Before The Wedding,

289
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,400
I Told Lucas That He
Shouldn't Marry Lindsey.

290
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,500
Why?

291
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,900
'Cause I Just Read
His New Novel,

292
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And When I Did, I Knew
Right Away That He Was
Still In Love With You,

293
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,800
Whether He's Ready
To Admit It Or Not.

294
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,000
It's A Book, Okay?

295
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,800
You Can't Draw Those Kind
Of Conclusions From A Story.

296
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,400
Really? What About
When W Write My Music?

297
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,700
Some Of My Subconscious Always Ends Up
Sneaking Into My Lyrics Somewhere.

298
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,600
I Don't Even Notice It
Until The Song's Done

299
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,600
I Thk K Lucas Is The Same Way
With His Writing.

300
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,600
Well, I Watched Him
Up On That Altar,

301
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,200
And It's Very Clear To Me
Where His Heart Lies,

302
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,200
And If I Can See It, I'm Not
Really Sure Why Lindsey Can't.

303
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,800
You Know,
It's Unfair To Luke.

304
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,200
He Loves Her.

305
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,500
I Think She's Just Afraid
Of The Idea Of You --

306
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,400
Your History With Him.

307
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,500
Think How You'd Feel
If The Roles Were Reversed.

308
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,900
Hi.
Sorrifif I Kept You Waiting.

309
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,300
I'm Dr. Copeland.

310
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,600
You Must Be
Brooke Davis.
Mm-Hmm.

311
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,400
Clothes, Right?
Yes.

312
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,000
I Thought You Looked Familiar.
Which Must Make You --

313
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,900
A Friend.
Lucas Scott.

314
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Great.

315
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,600
???

316
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,700
so You Can Know
What To Expect.

317
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,800
Are You Familiar
With Angie's Condition

318
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,200
Not Really. She Has A Hole
In Her Heart, Right?

319
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,800
She Has A Number Of Holes,
Actually,

320
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,300
But We're Gonna Fix Them.

321
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,100
We'll Put Angie
Under A General Anesthesia.

322
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,200
We'll Stop Her Heart,
And Then I'll Do The Repairs.

323
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,800
You Have To Stop Her Heart
For How Long?

324
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,800
Two Hours, Maybe Longer,

325
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,000
Depending On The Extent
Of Her Condition.

326
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,900
Two Hours?

327
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,400
Yes, That --
That's How We Do It, Brooke.

328
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,400
Angie Will Be On
A Heart-And-Lungacachine,

329
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,100
Which Will Keep Blood And Oxygen
Circulating In Her Body.

330
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,900
Then I Will Grt T Skin
From Another Part Of Her Heart

331
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,600
And Use It
To Fix The Holes.

332
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,600
How Do You Intend
To Restart Angie's Heart?

333
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,100
After The Repairs Are Complete,
We Will Use An Electric Shock.

334
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,500
And Once She's Stabilized,
We'll Take Her To The I.C.U.,

335
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,900
And You'll Be Able
To See Her Then.

336
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,200
I Know I Don't Have
A Choice Here,

337
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,000
Buththis Seems
So Dangerous.

338
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,800
I-Is The
Some Other Way?

339
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,500
Hmm, Uh, I'm Sorry,
But, U N No, There --

340
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,200
There Is No Other Way ???

341
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,200
Dr. Copeland,
What's Angie's Prognosis

342
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,600
If She Didn't
Have The Surgery?

343
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,200
A Year, Maybe Two.

344
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,400
And Then What?

345
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,100
She'll Die.

346
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,500
Look, Brooke, It's --
It's Okay To Be Nervous,

347
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,600
But, Um, I-I Just --
I Want You To Focus

348
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
On What A Great Thing It Is
That You're Doing For Angie.

349
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Okay.

350
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,400
Thank You.

351
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,200
So, If There Are
No Further Questions,

352
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,400
I Will See You
Next Wk.K.

353
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,400
Actually,
There Is One Thing.

354
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,500
Do You Happen To Know
A Dr. Thorn?N?

355
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,300
You're Shooting
Like Me Now.

356
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,900
Yeah, We Both
Former Ravens Now, Too.

357
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,700
What?

358
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,800
Why?

359
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh, Well, I Don't Know.
Let's See -- This Thing? Hmm?

360
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,800
You're Still
Part Of Thteteam, Q.

361
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,900
You Can't Just Quit
Because You're Iurured.

362
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,300
You Sound Like Your Brother Now.

363
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,000
I Mean, I Exctcted
A Little Grief From <I>You,</I>

364
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,500
But What's Lucas Know About
Ayaying Injured Anyway?

365
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,400
Let Me Tell You Something
About Lucas.

366
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,100
Lucas Played Injured
His Entire Senior Year.

367
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,400
It Cost Him
A Lot Of Playing Time,

368
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,200
But He Never Gave Up
On His Team.

369
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,200
And What If They
Make The Playoffs?
They Won't.

370
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,400
Even If They Do, Man,
It's My Shooting Hand, Nate.

371
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,000
I Ain't Gonna Be Ready
For The Scouts Anyway.

372
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Well, Then You'll Have To Learn
How To Play Differently.

373
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You're Gonna Have
To Reinvent Your Game.

374
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,300
Reinvent My -- Man,
That Ain't That Easy, Okay?

375
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Who Said
It Was Gonna Be Easy?

376
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,900
But What Are You Gonna Do?
Are You Gonna Quit?

377
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,800
Are You Gonna Throw Away
Everything You Ever Worked For?

378
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,600
No, I'm Not <I>Going</I> To.
I Already <I>Did,</I> Okay?

379
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,600
You Know
I Punched That Dudfofor <I>You?</I>

380
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,900
Oh, Come On.

381
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,400
I've Thrown
A Lot Of Punches,

382
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,700
And Every Last One
Was Selfish.

383
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,300
Now, Face It, Q.,
You Punched That Guy For <I>You.</I>

384
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,600
Deal With It.

385
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,000
You're Dead, Dude!
Deal With It!

386
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Hey!

387
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,800
These Gass
Are So Addicting.

388
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,600
I Just Waxed
A 13-Year-Old Kid From Arkansas.

389
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,400
He Was Pretty Upset.
Ok..

390
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
We're Gonna Veve
To Keep An Eye On That.

391
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,400
Millie, You Won't Guess What
Happened To Me Today At Rkrk.
What?

392
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,300
I'm Gonna Get A Shot To Anchor
The Sports Segments Tomorrow.

393
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,000
No Way!
Yeah,
The Regular Guy's Sick.

394
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,000
And The Station Manager's
Giving Me A Shot.

395
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,500
Marvin, That Is Great!

396
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,000
Just Think Of
All Those People Who Are Gonna Be
Watching You On Tv.

397
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,300
You Want To Come?
You Can Be There At The Statn.N.

398
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,200
I Wish I Could, But Brooke Has
Her Big Presentation Tomrorow,

399
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,200
And I Promised
To Look After The Baby.

400
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,100
But I'll Watch Every
Minute Of You On The
Big Screen At The Store.

401
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,100
I'm So Proud Of You,
Marvin.

402
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,700
You're Gonna Do Great.

403
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,500
Mama, Where Does
Grandpa Dan Live?

404
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,800
Uh, Why?

405
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,900
I Need To Thank Him
For My Birthday Present.

406
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,300
Can You Take Me?

407
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,400
Um, Well,
I-I Can't Do That Right Now,

408
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
'Cause, Well,
Grandpa Dan Lives At The Beach,

409
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,100
And It's Getting
Kind Of Late.

410
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,700
But I'll Tell You
What We <I>Can</I> Do.

411
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,100
You Can Write Your Grandpa Dan
A Thank-You Note,

412
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,800
And I Will Make Sure
That He Gets It.

413
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,500
Cooli'i'll Write The Best
Thank-You Note Ever.

414
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,000
Okay, Cool.

415
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,800
That's My Girl.
Okay.

416
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
Okay.

417
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,600
I Can't Even Get Her
To Smile, Luke.

418
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,300
Wh A Am I Doing?

419
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,500
What If She Dies?
What Then?

420
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,900
What Do I Tell
Her Parents --

421
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,300
These People
That I've Never Met?

422
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,200
What Made Me Think
I Could Handle This?

423
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,100
Hey, Just Remember,

424
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,500
You're Giving Angie A Chance
To Live A Full, Wonderful Life.

425
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,400
She Couldn't Do That
Without The Surgery.

426
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,400
Yeah, I Guess So.

427
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,400
Thank You
For Being Here For Us.

428
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,700
Thank You
For Letting Me.

429
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,200
Sweet Girl.

430
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,700

431
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,500

You Know That?

432
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
I Do Not.
Do Too..

433
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Ah, You Killing Me.

434
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,400
It's True.
Dan's Dying.

435
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,400
Without A Transplant,
He's Got Six Months.

436
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,600
And You're Sure?

437
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,100
I Spoke
With The Cardiologist.

438
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,700
So, What Are We
Gonna Do?

439
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,700
Nothing.

440
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,100
In Six Months, Dan's Out
Ofof Our Lives Once And For All.

441
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,100
It Cldldn't Happen
To A More Deserving Guy.

442
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,600
Maybe That Makes Me The One
With The Bad Heart, But I Say...

443
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,000
...Good Riddance.

444

446
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,200
getting up down the court so quickly.

447
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,900
Nonono, No!
Not Another 3, Man!

448
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
What, You Scared To Go
To The Hole, Little Man?

449
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,500
I'm Beating You,
Aren't I?

450
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,400
Yeah, But Why You Only
Shooting 3s?

451
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,500
'Cause 3s
Are Better Than 2s.

452
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,900
Have I Ever Told You
That You Was A Genius Lately?

453
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,300
Not Lately.
You Said I Sucd.D.

454
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,800
Well, I Keke It Back.
You Don't Suck.

455
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,700
Millie: Hi!
Hi, Sweetie!

456
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Brooke, You're Never
Gonna Believe This,

457
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,500
But Marvin's Doing
The Sports Segment On Thnenews.

458
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600

With North Carolina's
Own Blue Devils

469
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
Finding Themselves
On Top Of The East

470
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,900
Tar Heels.
Uh, Carolina Tar Heels.

471
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,600
They'rnonot, Um --

 <I>Where Tiger Woods</I>
 <I>Was Up To His Old Tricks Again.</I>

475
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,000
Today,Igiger Won
The Arnold Hill's Invitational.

476
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,500
Arnold Hill?
Who The Hell's Arnold Hill?

477
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,500
Um, The Arnold <I>Palmer</I>
Invitational

478
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
At The Pine Hills
Country Club.

479
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,800
That's Always Tricky.

480
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,300
That's Sports, And I'm, Uh...

481
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,300
 <I>Wet.</I>

482
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,100
That Wasn't Good, Was It?

483
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,400
At Least It's Over.

484
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,100
No, It's Not.
He Has Two More Broadcasts
This Afternoon.

485
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,600
Millie, Mouth Needs You
At The Tv Station

486
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,300
More Than I Need You Here,
So Come On.

487
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,600
If We Hurry, I Can Drop You Off
And Still Make It In Time.

488
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,200
Come On, Baby,
Let's Go.

489
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,900
Lucas: So...
Witht T Quentin,

490
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,400
We Have No Inside Game,
No Defense --

491
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,100
And No Assists.

492
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,200
I Got An Idea.

493
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,700
Let's Hear It.

494
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,700
I Say We Push The Tempo
And Just Shoot 3s --

495
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,700
Like, Almost <I>All</I> 3s.

496
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,500
I Mean, We Still Got
Some Good Outside Shooters,

497
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,400
And They're
In Pretty Good Shape,

498
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,100
So If We Push It, We Might Just
Run The Score Up High Enough

499
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,000
To Whe W We Don't Need
No Big Man In The Paint.

500
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,600
Almost All 3s, Huh?

501
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,600
He I It Wasn't My Idea.
It Was Him.

502
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,600
That's A Good Idea,
Jamie.

503
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,400
But, See,
With That Kind Of Offense,

504
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,800
We're Gonna Need A Really Strong
Player To Distribute The Ball

505
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,800
And Get Back On "D."

506
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,600

514
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,400
Okay, Weird And
Totally Inprpropriate Of Me.

515
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,500
But I'm Kind Of Here
For Lucas And For You.

516
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,300
Peyton, I Already Told You,
There's Nothing To Say.

517
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,200
Please, Hear Me Out.

518
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,200
'Cause I Know
That He Loves You,

Fr T That.

520
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,300
Yes,
He Wrote About A Comet,

521
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,200
But In His
Nonfiction Life,

522
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,300
He Seems Very Much
In Love With You.

523
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,500
Have You Read The Book,
Peyton?

524
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,500
I Didn't Think So,
Because If You Had,

525
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,900
You Wouldn't Be So Sure
Who Lucas Loves And How Much.

526
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,400
Lindsey, The Book
Was A Work Of Fiction.

527
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,700
But What Wasn't Fiction
Was The Fact

528
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,900
That He Said "I Do" To <I>You</I>
In That Church.

529
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,300
It's Not <I>Me</I> That Has
To Make A Decision About Lucas.

530
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,500
It's <I>You.</I>

531

Sometimes It Makes Him Sad.

544
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,000
I'd Give Anything
To See Him Play Again.

545
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,400
I Can Tell He Wants To.

546
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,300
You Realize I Can Make
One Phone Call

I've Never Told Anyone Else

553
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,700
But When I Was In Prison,
I Tried To Kill Myself.

554
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I Put A Rope Around My Neck,
And I Ieied To Hang Myself.

555
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:08,260

556
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,210
When I Stepped Off

But Then The Rope Bre,E,
And I Took It As A Sign --
