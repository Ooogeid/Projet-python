3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,650
I'm having money problems,dad.

4
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,520
I need your help.

5
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,470
Right now,you're not an investment i'm interested in.

6
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,050
I am the majority owner of tric...

7
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,140
Which means you can get the hell out.

8
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:13,830
Take your seats.

9
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,330
I'm your new english teacher -- Mr. Chavez.

10
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,360
Nick?

11
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,360
We really can't do this,right?

12
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,700
I'm not leaving here till i get my damn pills.

13
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,300
It's either the pills or me.

14
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,490
Leave me alone!

15
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,100
- Who are you? - Guess i'm your brother.

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,200
i know that was a lot of money,But i'm gonna pay you back -- Every cent.

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,960
Take your time.

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,900
How you doing?

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,570
He's with me.

20
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,710
What are you doing here?!

21
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,720
I came here to wish you luck.

22
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,970
Somebody might see you.

23
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,910
Oh,no one here knows me.

24
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,500
Besides,there's nothing wrong with a teacher coming up

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,800
To check on his most promising student --

26
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:10,060
His most promising,sexy,Irresistible student.

27
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,320
||Uh,brooke,where do you want these?

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,160
Um...

29
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,350

Fine.

Thank you again for helping me out today.

32
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,600
I'd be totally lost if it weren't for you. That's cool.

33
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,050
It gets me out of geography.

34
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,210
It's a good thing you're student-Council president.

35
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,080
So,what do you need me to do next?

36
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,290
Um,i need you to take these body jewels And paste them on tia.

37
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,670
I want them on her neck,her thighs,and her cleavage.

38
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,600
Mouth.

39
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,550
Breathe and paste.

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,630
Okay.

41
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,400
Hey,come on.

42
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,290
Oh,hey. I'm getting that.

43
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,720
You shouldn't be straining yourself.

44
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,860
You can't risk falling and stuff.

45
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,500
Relax. I'm pregnant,not elderly.

46
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,860
- Oh,anyway,i'm glad you're up. - Are you kidding me?

47
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,830
The semifinal's tonight. I could barely sleep.

48
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,100
I want to go to duke with you.

49
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,600
What?

50
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,080
I got my acceptance letter from duke,

51
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,270
And,um,it just made me think about what i want.

52
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,730
I want to make you happy more than anything else in the world,

53
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,660
So i want to go to duke with you! Oh,haley.

54
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,860
You've been so supportive of me and my dream for music,

55
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,860
And i just want to be supportive of you

56
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,960
And your dream for playing at duke.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,440
So i want to do this for us,okay?

58
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,060
How did i get so lucky?

59
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,230
It helps that you're hot. [ Chuckles ]

60
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,660

You're gonna be so happy there.

62
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:41,830
I got to go

63
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,330
'Cause i'm meeting skills and lucas for an early workout.

64
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,530
What's all this stuff for,anyway?

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,260
Babysitting. [ Laughs ]

66
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,630
I thought the extra experience and money couldn't hurt.

67
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,100
Besides,i just really don't want to be one of those moms

68
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,230
That's,like,completely overwhelmed and unprepared

69
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,860
And always screaming at her kids the way my mom used to be.

70
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,160
Oh,it's crazy. Anyway...

71
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,630
Um,the kids are coming by after school.

72
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,860
And,uh...

73
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,930
You know what -- You should stop by and say hi.

74
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,160
Nah. I'll pass. I don't really like kids.

75
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,360
<i>Uh,i'll like our kid.</i>

76
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,900
Yeah,get out of here,you bum.

77
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,940
Big hands...

78
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,680
Nice.

79
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,330
Oh!

80
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,730
I'm so,so sorry.

81
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,200
I'm -- I'm just not used to working this close to a girl --

82
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,660
I mean,a woman who is,like...

83
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,900
This hot.

84
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,860
Oh,my god. You're so cute i could eat you!

85
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,030
Please tell me you're a virgin.

86
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,860
[ Gasps ] oh,my god!

87
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,500
I'm totally eating you up!

88
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,330
I'm just gonna go kill myself now.

89
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,300
No,no.

90
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,200
It's so hard to find cute virgin boys.

91
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,750
<i>All my friends would love you.</i>

92
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,630
We're getting together tonight at a bar.

93
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,500
You should totally join us.

94
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,330
Me?

95
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,730
Join you and your friends?

96
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:11,220
Well,let's just say ****

97
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,970
So,that a "yes"?

98
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,400
Man: peyton.

99
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,500
How did you get in here?

100
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,030
<i>The question is,how didn't i get in?</i>

101
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,830
I popped open the back door,

102
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,830
<i>The basement window,and the window near the porch.</i>

103
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,810
Given your history,

104
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,630
I thought you'd pay more attention to home security.

105
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,650
Okay,what are you doing here?

106
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,620
I thought you weren't interested in sticking around.

107
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,360
I'm not.

108
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,210
I just wanted to make sure you're safe

109
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,500
Before i go back to my life.

110
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,330
<i>Well,i slept great last night...</i>

111
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,060
Alone. So mission accomplished.

112
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,730
Is that why you haven't been to school in over a week?

113
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,860
A lot of seniors skip class.

114
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,860
They skip school to do fun stuff,not hide in their room all day,

115
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,030
Afraid to step out onto their own porch.

116
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,560
That's not what i'm doing.

117
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,800
Well,if you're really over getting attacked by that psycho,

118
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,700
Then there's no reason you shouldn't be at school.

119
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,020
Unless you'd rather hang out here,

120
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,530
<i>Not feeling sorry for yourself.</i>

121
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,220
Fine.

122
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,030
If it'll get you out of my house,i'll go to school.

123
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,400
Fine. I'll drive you.

124
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,760
Fine.

125
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,730
Get moving. It's 0800.

126
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,400
I like the other derek better.

127
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,400
L. Scott -- 20 in a row.

128
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,860
The boy is on fire.

129
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,600
You ready for tonight?

130
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,460
I'd feel a lot better if i had you watching my back the whole ||me.

131
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,040
I know,But i promised my mom not a second more than 15 minutes.

132
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,900
It ain't like it's gonna take us half the time

133
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,600
To beat the chumps we're playin' tonight anyway.

134
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,900
Then we're going to states,so you know what that means.

135
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,590
We're about to be v.I.P. Around here,dawg.

136
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,140
I'm about to have all the females

137
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,060
Getting my name tattooed all over their body.

138
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,590
I'll be right back.

139
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,160
Daunte. Hey,man.

140
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,100
Um...i don't have your money yet.

141
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,960
I tried to get a loan from my mom,

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,930
And it turns out she's not doing so good.

143
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,400
I know it's 10 grand. 15.

144
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,100
What? You don't make your payments on time,

145
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,060
Juice keeps running on the money.

146
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,160
You said i could pay you back whenever.

147
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,530
Yeah. It goes without saying there's a price with that.

148
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,660
I mean,this is the streets,nathan.

149
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,400
We're not bank of tree hill.

150
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,130
What am isupposed to do?

151
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,130
I can't come up with that kind of cash overnight.

152
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,230
<i>Well,i could forget the amount.</i>

153
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,460
The ravens are favored to win by 10 points tonight.

154
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,260
A lot of people are betting on it.

155
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,830
I think we're a lock to win by a lot more than that.

156
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,530
We're gonna blow those guys out.

157
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,930
Uh,not if||ou want your debt to go away.

158
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,260
Look,nathan,you can win the game --

159
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,600
Just don't win it by more than nine points.

160
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,630
No way.

161
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,500
Nathan,i'm not asking you to lose.

162
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,980
The ravens will still win and go to the state championship.

163
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,460
You'll be debt-Free.

164
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,630
The way i see it,everybody wins.

165
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,460
Look,nathan,i'm trying to help you out,here.

166
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,110
Before you get yourself in trouble,

167
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,200
Take the offer,or have my money tonight.

168
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,620
Do you know those guys?

169
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,730
Not personally,but i heard they're into a lot of bad stuff,

170
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,360
So anything they want with nate can't be good.

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,030
Very funny.

180
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,460
Let me ask you -- If i am so fat,

181
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,300
<i>- Why am i on the cover of maxim? - What?!</i>

182
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,400
<i>For the first time,maxim put a hometown hottie on the cover,</i>

183
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,600
And that hottie is me!

184
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,880
Oh,my god!

185
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,230
Let's celebrate tonight after the game.

186
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,100
Ooh,i can't. I have plans tonight.

187
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,290
Let me guess -- You're going out with mr. Chavez.

188
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,090
I don't know what you're talking about.

189
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,560
I saw you sneak out last night to meet him.

190
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,620
You claimed it was over.

191
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,520
<i>And you claim you're not a slut,and that is such a lie.</i>

192
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,980
I never claimed i wasn't a slut.

193
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,630
<i>You need to worry less about my love life</i>

194
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,130
And more about your own with,like,every guy in america,

195
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,960
Because you are so hot in this spread!

196
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,860
I know. [ Both laughing ]

197
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,300
Ahhhhhh!

198
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,500
Oh,no!

199
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,060
Ahhhhh!

200
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,630
Hey. [ Gasps ]

201
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,560
Whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa. Peyton,what's wrong?

202
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,460
Oh,come on.

203
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,060
Let's get you home.

204
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,610
I don't know what's wrong with me.

205
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,300
My back problems just won't let up.

206
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,660
Perhaps physical therapy could help.

207
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,900
Or those,um,those pills you gave me the last time.

208
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,400
They fixed me right up.

209
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,230
To be honest with you,deb,

210
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,160
<i>I am not comfortable prescribing you more medication.</i>

211
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,660
[ Sighs ] okay,this is awkward.

212
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,430
Um...

213
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,800
<i>I guess we both know i don't actually have back problems.</i>

214
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,160
<i>My issues are far more complicated.</i>

215
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,130
I've lost my son,my husband,

216
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,330
And i've realized that without my family --

217
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,730
Dysfunctional as it was --

218
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,400
I'm a failure.

219
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,630
Deb,i'm sure these pills are making you feel better,

220
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,400
But they are not the answer.

221
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,030
You need to get your life in order,starting with therapy.

222
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,860
You're right.

223
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,530
I will make the appointment for you.

224
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,100
Okay,everyone,settle down.

225
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,410
People!

226
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,300
Magazines aren't allowed in class.

227
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,230
And,you,stop making a spectacle of yourself.

228
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,600
What's the matter,mr. Chavez?

229
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,360
I thought you liked high-School girls.

230
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,900
After school,miss gatina.

231
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:11,910
next we present the latest degsin from *** by designer ***

232

Mouthy...

233
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,830
Can you come over here and help me put on my shoe?

234
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,400
I don't want to chip my nails.

235
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,000
Thanks.

236
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,830
Now i know why they call you "mouth."

237
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,000
By the way,i'm really excited for tonight.

238
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,500
Hey,you.

239
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,830
I heard you're helping out with brooke's show.

240
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,300
Yeah. Uh...

241
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,930

<i>Came to check you out.</i>

243
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,600
And i had to ask you a question.

244
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,830
Which do you like better,red or blue?

245
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,230
Red,i guess. Why?

246
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,520
I was trying to figure out what to wear tonight...

247
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,260
On our date.

248
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,330
Right...

249
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,730
Our date...

250
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,060
Tonight.

251
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,430
Well,red it is.

252
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,200
Okay,see yotonight.

253
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,630
Yeah.

254
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,800
Tonight.

255
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,030
Hey,guys,come on in. Good tsee you.

256
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,300
Oh,i'm so excited to have the kids.

257
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,630
Um,listen,i don't want you to worry.

258
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,530
I've read all the latest childcare periodicals,

259
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,500
And i'm cpr certified.

260
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,300
And i've stacked up on organic snacks

261
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,600
And some really fun learning games for the kids.

262
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,530
So if you have any questions,feel free.

263
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,860
Just one.

264
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,530
Do you have the numbers for the local authorities?

265
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,230
Oh,yeah,of course. Yeah. Super.

266
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,160

267
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,100
Okay. Um...

268
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,830
Okay,kids,what do you want to do first?

269
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,460
Kids?

270
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,540
I'd say,"nice spread,"

271
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,260
But that's probably inappropriate for a teacher.

272
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,700
Bet you wouldn't have a problem saying it to brooke.

273
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,200
Aren't you her teacher,too?

274
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,060
I get it.

275
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,530
You like to be the center of attention,

Get a rise out of people.

277
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,200
It's the hallmark of insecurity.

Wow.

279
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,930
You're an underpaid high-School teacher sleeping with a student,

<i>And i'm insecure?</i>

So what do you want?

284
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,230
Just one thing.

285
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,500
I think we should close the door for this.

Hey. Peyton,uh...

287
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,310

Instead of hiding and pretending everything's fine.

300

Miss davis,there are allegations

410
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,810
That our newest teacher,mr. Chavez,

411
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:23,150
Has been having sexual relations with a student,

412
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,710
And we're told that student is you.

413
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,110
That's not true.

414
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,610
It's a serious matter,

415
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,980
And until it's cleared up,mr. Chavez is suspended.

416
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,310
If it comes to light any part of the allegations are true...

417
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,310
He'll be fired.

<i>But they're not,and whoever said that to you is lying.</i>

Who would do that?

420
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,550
I would.

421
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,190
I got suspended today.

422
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,430
I know.

423
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,890
Did you also know that rachel's a conniving bitch?

424
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:08,940
I thought she was a friend of yours.

425
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,190
Why would she go to the principal?

1
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,910
Because she said you hit on her.

2
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,550
- Brooke... 
- is it true?

3
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,690
How can you even ask that?
Especially since she hit on me.

4
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,850
She made some snide comment about us in class.

5
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,860
It got me rried.

6
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,020
I tried talking to her,but she started coming on to me.

7
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,570
Said she thought older guys were hot.

8
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,990
I can't believe she'd do that -- Not to me.

9
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,820
Brooke,people talk about her. 
Even the teachers.

10
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,000
I get the sense that this behavior's 
pretty typical for rachel.

11
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,220
Yeah,but i'm her friend.

12

No,i don't think you understand.

37
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,310
I can bail you out and use my clout as 
mayor to have the charges dropped.

38
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,240
Hell,i'll even throw in a couple of 
painkillers for your ride home.

39
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:15,940
Or you can risk spending the next 
two to four years as some con's cell bitch

40
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,690

I don't know.

91

I was kind of getting used to the yelling.

92
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,420
Look,I know this psycho's still out there,

<i> U can let it destroy you,
or you can get up and fight.</i>

95

And if it feels like i'm beating up on you,

96
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,240
It's only because i want you to get 
so pissed off you start swinging back.

97
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,700
Well,i don't know if i'm strong enough.

98
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,210
If you feel like you're not strong enough,

99
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,180
Then fall back on me.

100
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:04,490
Because i'll be here.Okay?

101
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:07,090
I'll be here as long as you keep trying.

00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,780
You said you didn't want that.

103
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,040
I know.

104
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,590
It's just i haven't let many people in,peyton.

105
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,090
So maybe i was the one who was scared.

106

Come on,nate,kick the ball out,man.

112
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,410
- What's up?
- Sorry.

113
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,160
What is going on***

114
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:00,470
Can somebody explain to me 
why we're only four points up

115
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,120
When we should be blowing them out of the water?!

116
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:08,100
<i>It's like you guys are trying to give away points!</i>

117
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,880
Get out there and shoot around!

118
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,090
You need it!

119
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,390
Hey,nate...

120
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,120
- What's going on? 
- With what?

121
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,130
Well,the way you're playing tonight.

122
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,430
It's not nerves. I know you.

123
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,070
You don't know anything.

124
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,570
Well,i know you were having money problems.

125
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,390
And i know dan didn't help you out.

126
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,350
Then suddenly you're talking to 
those guys out there on court,

127
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,100
And now you're playing like crap.

128
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,210
What do they want you to do nate?

129
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,560
What -- Lose the game?

130
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,870
Betray your teammates and your coach for a couple of bucks?

131
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,220
All right,listen to me.

132
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,620
Take the self-Righteous and shove it.

133
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,310
<i>Until you're drowning in debt,
you've got a wife and a kid on the way,</i>

134
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,570
<i>You can't begin to understand what i'm going through.</i>

135
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,500
You better help me understand,or i'm going to whitey.

136
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,390
Listen,i'd never lose a game,okay?

137
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,220
We're still gonna win...

138
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,160
Just by less than 10 points.

139
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,330
Llucas,don't,okay?

140
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,870
The only reason we've gone this far is because of me.

141
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,410
And besides,all anybody cares about is winning.

142
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,550
Nobody cares if i gave it my all or not.

143
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,670
Do you really believe that?

144
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,690
Yeah,okay? I have to believe that.

145
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,710
I got no other way out.

146
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,300
Unless you got 15 grand lying around.

147
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,430
Is there a problem here?

148
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,370
No.

149
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,130
Gee,i really need to stop being roommates

150
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,100
With boyfriend-Stealing skanks,peyton.

151
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,790
Oh,i mean,rachel.

152
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,900
- What are you talking about? 
- I talked to nick.

153
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,720
He told me what really happened.

154
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:52,710
You went in,shoved your magazine 
spread in his face,and hit on him.

155
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,050
I wouldn't do that to you.

156
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,230
<i>Really? Let's go over the
 list of things you have done to me.</i>

157
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,490
You tried to seduce lucas when he was my boyfriend,

158
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,230
Take my spot as cheer captain,and two weeks ago,

159
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,780
<i>You told the entire school that i was pregnant!</i>

160
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,040
<i>I was just beginning to think you were a real person,</i>

161
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,870
But you're just a slutty,lying liar who lies.

162
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,010
Gimme,gimme! Gimme,gimme!

163
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,550
It's not polite,you guys. Here.

164
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,380
Thank you. Sorry...sorry.

165
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,640
Hey -- Hey,you guys. Now,don't throw popcorn.

166
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,230
Hey! That is not a nice thing to do.

167
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,390
Hey,haley!

168
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,670
How's the babysitting going? 

169
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,970
It's horrible.

170
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,840
<i>These kids are driving me crazy.</i>

171
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,720
The game's already started. I'm completely stressed out.

172
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:34,500
******everything ***************

173
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,700
- You want the truth?
- Yes.

174
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,720
Nothing. You just got to hang in there.

175
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,790
No,no! Karen!

176
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,730
Glad you could make it.

177
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,170
What's this?

178
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,190
Ownership papers to tric.

179
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,490
It's all yours.

180
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,880
Dan,what did you do?

181
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,950
Oh,i just beat some sense into deb.

182
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,560
I'm kidding.

183
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,050
I caught her at a rare sober moment,

184
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,740
Offered to get her some help in exchange for tric.

185
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,240
Look,uh,accepting an old crib from you is one thing,

186
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,160
But this is too much.

187
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,550
You'd rather deb have it? You saw the news.

188
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,050
She could barely take care of herself.

189
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,260
Look,no matter your feelings for me,

190
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,070
This is the right thing to do -- For you and the baby...

191
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,080
And for business.

192
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,530
Tell me i'm wrong -- I'll take it back.

193
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,470
Okay,it's definitely the strangest gift i've ever gotten.

194
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,890
Not sure that i'm "million dollar baby" material.

195
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,810
Trust me.

196
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,360
If we share any genes,you've got some fight in you.

197
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,100
Where'd you learn to box?

198
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,260
My dad -- Well,our dad --

199
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,940
Started me really young.

200
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,560
That was before he left my mom and me.

201
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:50,760
You know?

202
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:53,350
Guess this is why i didn't want to meet you.

203
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,900
You know,i always hated him

204
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:59,030
For leaving and meeting ellie...

205
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,140
And having you --

206
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,200
Even though i didn't know you.

207
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,180
That kind of anger used to eat me up,

208
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,330
You know?

209
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,540
Then i started punching it out.

210
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,610
You know,taking the pain head on,

211
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,770
Driving it back.

212
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,510
I'm hoping you could do the same,okay?

213
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:19,010
"The world backs off when you make it back off," right?

214
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,070
Yeah.

215
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,240
I don't --I don't know if i can.

216
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,550
I do. Come on.

217
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:28,290
Now,you want to use your whole body,all right?

218
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,460
You want to an on this foot here,all right?

219
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,300
Okay. 

220
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,370
Yeah.

221
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,010
time winding down in the fourth quarter,

222
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,840
And the ravens have a 7-Point lead --

223
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:44,970
Now 9 points.

224
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,380
And the cats are gonna call time-Out.

225
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,320
Nathan,take a seat.

226
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,670
What? Why?

227
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,110
Because we're up by 9,

228
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,230
And i'm not gonna expose my best player to injuries.

229
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,820
Coach,we only got a couple seconds left.

230
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,650
It only takes one to blow out a knee.

231
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,760
Now sit down.

232
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,460
Luke,come here.

233
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,150
Look,they're gonna be looking to foul.

234
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,030
You're our best free-Throw shooter.

235
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,200
<i>Now,i want you to go in there and ice this thing.</i>

236
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,490
one,two,three --Ravens!

237
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,910
If the ravens score one more point,

238
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,940
Nathan scott doesn't leave this gym in one piece.

239
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,490
so,lucas scott checks in to the game. 
The ravens are up by 9.

240
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,320
Just five seconds stand between them

241
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,430
And a trip to the state championship.

242
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,590
Three seconds now.

243
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,320
The ravens pick up a quick steal!

244
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,670
And that's gonna ice it.

245
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,300
With two seconds left on the clock,

246
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,460
The ravens are headed to the state championship.

247
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:47,010
All that remains is for lucas scott to seal it.

248
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,880
What's his free-Throw percentage,gigi?

249
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:53,980
Well,he's 92% from the line...
And 100% hot.

250
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,250
If luke can make this free-Throw,

251
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,930
The lead will be 10 points,and that would be

252
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,450
The ravens' ninth double-Digit victory of the season.

253
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,480
The shot is up..

254
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,740
And it's no good!

255
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,700
The cats||ebound,

256
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,410
The buzzer sounds,and this one's over!

257
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:03,980
Whoo!We win!
The crowds**************crazy!

258
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,390
The ravens have won by 9!

259
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,890
They're headed to the state championship,baby!

260
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,660
Whoo!

261
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:38,110
******Great job on the play-By-Play,dawg.

262
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,270
But now that we going to state,

263
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,910
I kind of want to pump up my profile a little bit.

264
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,400
So... i was thinking...

265
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:46,570
Maybe you could start referring to me as...

266
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,680
"Mad skills taylor."

267
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,190
Everything cool,man?

268
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,210
Actually,i need your advice.

269
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,850
Um,if you had to choose a date

270
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,170
Between a super-Hot model and her model friends

271
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,340
Or a nice girl who's kind of odd,

272
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,360
Who'd you pick?

273
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,320
Hmm...That's an interesting dilemma.

274
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:14,330
Uh...I say pick the girl
That's the most beautiful on the inside.

275
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,980
Man,is you crazy?

276
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,940
Look,first of all,

277
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,870
Models ain't just walking around 
handing out party passes

278
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,420
To no too-Short,no-Ass kids like you.

279
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:27,350
*********i'm just say.

280
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,550
...don't blow it.

281
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,860
I mean,opportunity only gonna knock once.

282
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:34,440
And if you don't answer...I will.

283
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,450
I'm sorry,have you guys seen a little boy,a little girl,

284
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,860
<i>Blond-Hair,blue-Eyed,really loud and...?</i>

285
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,250
Great.

286

So,i'm gonna teach you how to shoot real quick,okay?

289
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,290
Put your index finger right there.

290
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,040
Whoa,that was awesome!

291
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,830
When i grow up,i want to be just like you.

292
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:22,030
* and to know you is hard

293
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,090

294
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,730
- Brooke.
- Hey.

295
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,940
Do you mind if i stay here?

296
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:36,240
After all that stuff that happened with rachel today,

297
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:38,120
I just can't stay with her tonight.

298
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,430
Sure,but i was just heading out to get something to eat.

299
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,630
Want to?

300
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,550
Yeah. Yeah,i'm starving.

301
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,690
Let me just put my bag down.

302
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,070
Brooke.

303
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,560
Brooke.

304
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,460
Well,i don't know who i hate more...

305
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,430
Mr. Chavez.

306
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,470
You,for being a lying bastard

307
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,070
Or me for believing your crap and betraying my friend.

308
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,830
* to know me as hard

309
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,710
* be goin'

310
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,370
* is to know me all wrong...

311
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,410
<i>regret comes in all shapes and sizes.</i>

312
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,280
<i>Some are small...</i>

313
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,980
<i>Like when we do a bad thing for a good reason.</i>

314
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,900
Hi,friend.

315
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:47,770
<i>Some are bigger...</i>

316
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,790
<i>...like when we let down a friend.</i>

317
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,900
You were right.

318
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,920
I'm sorry,brooke.

319
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,130
I wish i wasn't.

320
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:06,950
* every occasion i'll be ready for the funeral *

321
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,470
* and every occasion...

322
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,340
<i>Some of us escape the pangs of regret</i>

323
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,460
<i>By making the right choice.</i>

324
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:23,670
Hi.I'm glad i picked red.

325
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,450
You look beautiful.

326
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:33,110
* ...only to show you down fled *

327
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,170

328
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:44,100
i gonna sleep.

329
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,750
Or not.

330
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:54,560
Oh...You still think you like kids?

331
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,250
 i'll like our kid.

332
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,140
<i>Some of us have little tim for regret</i>

333
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:06,260
<i>Because we're looking forward to the future.</i>

334
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:15,560
<i>Sometimes we have to fight to come to terms with the past.</i>

335
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:21,940
<i>And sometimes we bury our regret</i>

336
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:26,070
<i>By promising to change our ways.</i>

337
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,880
Wanted to say thanks.

338
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,570
I know how hard it was for 
you to throw those points away.

339
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,460
Look...I'll make it up to you 
and the team at state,okay?

340
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:45,340
The point-Shaving was just a one-Time thing.

341
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,790
It's over now.

342
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,770
<i>But our biggest regrets</i>

343
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,680
<i>Are not for the things we did...</i>

344
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,890
<i>But for the things we didn't do.</i>

345
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,010
<i>Things we didn't say...</i>

346
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,750
<i>That could have saved someone we care about...</i>

347
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,810
Nathan...

348
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:13,190
You know i'll always be there for you.

349
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,890
But never again.

350
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,640
<i>...especially when we can see</i>

351
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:35,770
<i>The dark storm that's headed their way.</i>
