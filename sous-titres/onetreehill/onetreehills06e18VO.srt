previously  on "one tree hill"...

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,600
I have a problem with the essay
you selected for the school paper.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,670
I understand,but i thought I was in charge of the
school paper and had final say on what went in it.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,990
And i have final say on
whether or not you work here.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,220
If continuing this pgnancy
means I lose you,then we end it.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,850
I'm having this baby.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,660
We're having this baby.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,180
What do you want me to say?

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,530
How about,julian"?

10
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,780
How about,"I like you"?

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,040
You want to talk about
keith?Let's talk about keith.

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,660
From the way I see it,I pulled
the trigger,but you loaded the gun.

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,520
It's good that you're
gonna die soon,dan.

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,550
Grandpa?

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,130
It's time for you to get better.

hash,would yosay he'd be okay...

or no?

24
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,900
Sit your stupid ass down,and
I'll call a veterinarian.

25
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,970
Mr. Scott.

26
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,600
- We'll get you prepped in a moment.
- Okay.

27
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,460
Lucas. Is everything all right?

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,570
It's fine.I'm getting a heart.

29
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,040
It's about time.

30
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,080
I need a helicopter.

31
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,880
For the final river court
scene -- lucas told me.

32
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,530
But you can shoot it with a
crane.You don't need a helicopter.

33
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,660
Yes,but I've never had
sex in a helicopter before.

34
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,100
Excuse me,julian?Brooke davis on line 1.

35
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,240
Nice.

36
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,860
- I have to call her back.
- Okay.

37
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,060
Is that the girl that
auditioned for peyton?

38
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,290
Yeah.And she was about to be the
girl who auditioned for peyton,slash,

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,830
new office P.A.Having sex with me
in a helicopter,until you ruined it.

40
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,010
I wonder if we could do it in a crane.

41
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,260
Julian,you have a call.

42
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,560
It kind of gets a little crazy right
before production.Can you take a message?

43
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,630
Okay,but it's the head of the
studio -- I mean,your father.

44
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,160
He said it was urgent.

45
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,370
Yeah,dad,what's up?

46
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,400
All right,8 seconds left,down by 2.

47
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,360
Here's what I want.I want
you here,here,here,and here.

48
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,750
Set the picks there,pick there,knock down the
shot,and send their sorry butt home in O.T.

49
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,950
You got me?!

50
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,060
All right.

51
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,740
Big game james,I want you to
inbound the ball and take the shot.

52
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,700
- You with me?
- Yeah.

53
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,400
All right.

54
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,890
"No mercy" on 3.

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,370
1,2,3.

56
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,900
No mercy!

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,910
Ball,ball!Pass it,pass it!

58
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,560
James,look!Look!

59
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,960
Pass the ball!Pass the ball!

60
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,780
Ball! Madison,ball! Ball!

61
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,110
Hey,ref,that was a foul,man!

62
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,670
Dude,there were like a dozen fouls.

63
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,010
Go home.

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,030
I asked you here today,haley,because I
thought we should talk things through.

65
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,580
Having a teacher on suspension
is never good for us.

66
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,590
Well,I would be happy to not be
on suspension,but that's up to you.

67
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,590
And I'd be happy to end your suspension,as
long as you agree to print an apology

68
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,650
for your actions in the next
edition of the school paper.

69
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,070
I've prepared it for you.

70
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,610
I'll also be taking over the paper's
publishing responsibilities going forward.

71
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,340
In addition,you'll address
your literature class

72
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:30,290
and explain that you were wrong and that
you showed a serious error in judgment.

73
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,930
And if I don't?

74
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,220
You'll be fired.

75
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,270
Jack?Jack!

76
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,070
Jack!

77
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,580
Just give it to me.And go,okay?

78
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,150
I won't tell,I promise.

79
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,390
Just go.Go.

80
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,910
Shoplifting,sam?

81
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,960
You have everything you could ever want,and
you are out ealing,like a common thief?

82
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,690
They're not even pressing charges!

83
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,460
Because I cried and begged and
told them you were semi-retarded!

84
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,870
That is not the point.What the hell?

85
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,150
Did you ever consider that maybe
it was a case of mistaken identity

86
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,900
and that maybe I wasn't shoplifting and that
maybe,just maybe,they got the wrong person?

87
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,240
The wrong peonwith the pack
of hot dogs and no receipt?

88
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,790
I don't even like hot
dogs,and I have the money!

89
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,470
The thing is -- the thing is,You
are an unfixable little smartass,

90
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,170
who apparently is gonna
do whatever she wants.

91
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,060
Don'T.

92
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,000
Brooke,it's julian.

93
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:38,250
I'm sorry --  I've been kind of out
of touch,and I need to talk to you.

94
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,320
Call me.

95
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,930
That got anything to do
with why you're so mad at me?

96
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,360
No.

97
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:50,020
I am mad at you because it doesn't
feel like you're making any progress.

98
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,770
You stole from me at clothes
over bros,and I figured,

99
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:57,420
"okay,you were desperate,you
lacked guidance,you felt unloved.

100
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,800
" So,what do I do?

101
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,320
I forgive you,I take
you in,I care for you,

102
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,790
give you anything you want,and
you make me feel like an idiot!

103
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,750
Is that what you really
think -- that I'm unfixable?

104
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,380
Oh,don't put this on me,sam.

105
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,210
I am not the one who got caught stealing
today and then tried to lie my way out of it.

106
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,740
I'm not lying!

107
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,370
And I wasn't stealing,either!

108
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,510
But you know what -- whatever.Believe
whatever the hell you want to believe.

109
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,100
Okay.

110
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,320
Okay,well,maybe you can make
a few cal and get back to me.

111
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,290
Yeah,thanks.

112
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,210
Is everything okay with peyton?

113
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,470
Yeah,so far.Thanks for asking.

114
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,570
Um,what's up?My dad called a
little while ago.He's been fired.

115
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,540
That's too bad.How's he taking it?

116
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,520
Well,he's taking it with a huge cash
settlement and an overall production deal.

117
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,860
Well,so he's good.

118
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,750
I don't think you understand,luke.

119
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,840
Reese: Korman,it's
me.Uh,yeah,I heard.Listen.

120
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,860
I'm pay or play,right?

121
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,160
You're the man. Bye.

122
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,110
Well,boys,it's been a good run.

123
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,590
At least I'm getting paid.

124
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,630
Waitwait,reese,hold on.

125
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,070
What's going on,julian?

126
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,160
What's going on is,the
movie just died,luke.

127
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:18,400
Our movie just died,and you just
lost your $300,000 production bonus.

128
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,180
Is that true?

129
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,120
When the studio head is terminated,most of the
projects that aren't shooting yet go into turnaround.

130
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,460
Okay.

131
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,060
What's -- what's
turnaround?

132
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,380
- It means they put things on hold.
- Tell the truth,julian.Come on.

133
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,070
Luke... it means your
movie's dead,done,over.

134
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,950
It's like they're all in the third
grade.When the new guy comes in.

135
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,830
He doesn't want to play with the old guy's
toys.He throws them out,buys his own toys.

136
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,720
No,not always.Not always.

137
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,980
This movie got a ton of love from a lot
of executives that are still at the studio,

138
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,280
so just give me a second,hang tight.

139
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:54,280
Let me make some calls,okay?I'm
nna do everything I can to fix this.

140
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,620
You do that.

141
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,710
This movie is so over.

142
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,300
We're really sorry,coach uncle skills.

143
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,940
It's okay.

144
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,470
It'sy.Ot oka we stink!

145
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,170
We suck.

146
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,680
We're hosed.

147
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,020
Well,wait,hold on,now.

148
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,010
We only lost by two points.

149
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,640
Yeah,but we still lost.

150
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,330
Yeah,but you got to look at
things from the brighter side.

151
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,200
Chuck,you played the whole game today without fouling
and without punching somebody in the crotch,right?

152
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,830
Yeah.

153
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,710
Madison... you didn't start doing your
homework on the bench until the second half,

154
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,820
even when I knew it was killing
you to just relax and have fun.

155
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,220
Right?

156
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,430
All right.

157
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,950
Jamie scott
-- 14 points.

158
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,240
Andre fields
-- 8 points.

159
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,560
And caroline rutenbar -- 2 points,2
rebounds,and no pee in the pants.

160
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,650
Y'all give it up.

161
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,430
All right,don't do drugs,stay in
school,and nanny deb has all the snacks.

162
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,650
Y'all get on out of here,rock stars.

163
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,280
You are so good with them.

164
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,970
Hey,I love kids.

165
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,060
Maybe one day,we'll
have some of our own.

166
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,740
Hey,wait.Save me a juice box.

167
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,720
I am so pissed off!

168
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,560
So,she expects you to apologize.

169
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,620
Yes.Can you believe that?

170
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,090
Well,I bet our kitchen drawers
are really organized right now.

171
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,870
Why do you say that?

172
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,400
Because.

173
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,850
That's who you are,haley james.

174
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,000
And I know that even though
rimkus is completely wrong,

175
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,940
you're thinking about taking
the high road on this one,

176
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,040
because you're a good teacher
and you care about your students.

177
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,470
Yeah,I do care,but
you know what --

178
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,920
when you're young and you look
at how great your life's gonna be,

179
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:52,190
you don't think about having a rimkus there to screw it all
up with her written apologies and her stupid-ass policies,

180
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,220
and it's totally unfair that I
have to apologize for something,

181
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,160
when I don't even think I was
wrong,because i wasn't wrong.

182
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,110
I get it,baby.And I completely agree.

183
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,220
And if you want to tell rimkus
to shove it,I'm good with that.

184
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:07,220
But I think you know that if you do that,these
kids are gonna lose the best teacher they have.

185
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,480
Yeah.

186
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,800
So,I'm thinking I'm just
gonna love you even more,

187
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:15,290
because... you're probably gonna take the
high road and be gracious and honorable,

188
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,050
because that's who you are,haley james.

189
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,090
Our kitchen drawers are
really organized,by the way.

190
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,160
Hi,"Q." Uncle lucas let me come say hi.

191
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,270
We had a game today,and I
scored a bunch of points.

192
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,460
But we lost.

193
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,710
He's doing really good,"Q.

194
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,150
" He's got your crossover dribble.

195
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,040
Andre did great,too.

196
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,390
I know he misses you a lot.We all do.

197
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,670
I'll be right back,okay?

198
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:58,320
The truth is,I see how worried the
doctors are and how terrified lucas is,

199
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,940
so I'm trying to be strong through
all of it,but I'm scared,mom.

200
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,150
So if you could put in a good
word for us up there... Thanks,mom.

201
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,870
This place is way too full
of people I love and miss.

202
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,370
There's not any room for any more.

203
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,070
You hear me?

204
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,010
Not even one.

205
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,350
Hey,I'll go wait in the car.

206
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,580
Okay.

207
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,940
You ready to go,jame?

208
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,950
How did great-uncle keith die?

209
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,110
He was shot,jamie.

210
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,570
- Like quentin?
- Yeah.

211
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,340
Why do people do bad things
like that,uncle lucas?

212
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,890
Maybe you should ask your grandpa dan.

213
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,440
Is that all you got?!

214
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,540
That's the best you can do?!

215
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:31,030
A crazy bitch nanny and a dog?!

216
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,680
That supposed to be some
kind of karmic lesson?

217
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,450
Well,I don't need your lesson.

218
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:42,580
D I'm not gonna apologize,either,or
cower or beg or cry!

219
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,350
I've done that.

220
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,930
It's over.

221
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,280
And let me tell you something else.

222
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,610
I'm not gonna pray,either.

223
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,450
You hear me?!

224
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,660
I won't!I showed remorse.

225
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,910
I said "I'm sorry.

226
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:06,090
" And if that's not good enough,you come
and get me,god,you miserable son of a bitch.

227
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,110
I give up.

228
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,000
this wasn't great day to be alive.

229
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,240
Julian: It's over.

230
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,910
I talked to everybody I could at
the studio,shutting down production.

231
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,160
It's just politics and bad timing,luke.

232
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,790
So it's definitely not happening.

233
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,830
I'm sorry.

234
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,580
Now I got to go tell a bunch of
people they just lost their jobs.

235
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,700
What about brooke?Did
you talk to her yet?

236
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,430
I tried calling her,but... I'm not
really worried about brooke davis.

237
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,840
Something tells me she'll be just fine.

238
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,980
I didn'tean the job part.

239
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,340
Yeah,I didn't either.

240
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,330
- See you guys around.Bye,jamie.
- Bye.

241
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,260
Well... you were worried about
the book becoming a movie,

242
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,320
anyway -- l the
stuf with keith.

243
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,480
Yeah.

244
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,110
Can I have this picture?

245
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,380
Sure,jame.

246
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,580
What now?

247
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,240
It's peyton.

248
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,140
Okay.

249
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,730
What's wrong?

250
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,140
They don't like the song.

251
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,950
Who?John or the a&r guys?

252
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,530
Apparently all of them.And
it's not like they hate it,okay?

253
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,740
They just don't love
it the same way we do.

254
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,750
- Well,theyg!
- wron I agree.

255
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,660
What do they want to do?

256
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:57,560
They thought we should try
it on guitar insteaof piano.

257
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,100
But it's perfect on the piano.

258
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,870
Maybe so,honey,but if you love this song and
you want to keep it,maybe you should just try it.

259
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,000
What do you think,haley?

260
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,840
Sometimes you have to play the game.

261
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,470
What game you playing,boy?

262
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,360
"Sims." I'm making my own tree hill.

263
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,190
Is there a skills character?

264
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,830
Yeah.But he mostly just gets
all mushy with nanny deb.

265
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,760
I like your style,baby.

266
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,340
See if you can give uncle
skills  two nanny debs.

267
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,570
- Okay.
- Good man.

268
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,830
But just don't tell the real
nanny deb I said that,okay?

269
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,780
That kid is a genius.

270
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,510
And his nanny's kind of great,too.

271
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,820
You okay?

272
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:56,020
I've been meaning to talk
to you for some time now.

273
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,600
Okay.

274
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,170
I think we should
end this -- us.

275
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,420
I think we should break up.

276
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,880
Wait.Why?

277
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:12,520
Because yoshould be a father and have
a family -- one that I can't give you.

278
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,000
Look,baby,you're not that old.

279
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,190
I mean,you could still have kids.

280
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,670
Yes,i could.

281
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,690
But I don't want to.

282
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,910
Okay.I'm good with that.

283
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:33,260
Oh,you're such a sweet and wonderful
guy,and -- and we have so much fun together.

284
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,770
But at the end of the day,you
deserve more than this.

285
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,680
I don't want more than this.

286
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,790
I think  this is good enough.

287
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,460
For me... but not for you.

288
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,680
I'm sorry.

289
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,050
Brooke,it's julian!

290
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,710
It's julian.

291
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,960
I don't want to talk to him.

292
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,160
Are you guys fighting?

293
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,360
Not exactly.

294
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,940
What not exactly happened?

295
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,480
Nothing.

296
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,560
And I'm still pissed
at you for shoplifting.

297
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,180
You should talk to him.

298
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,710
We're fine.Some time apart
might do us some good,anyway.

299
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,450
Don'T.

300
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,130
Hey,julian.Yeah,she's right here.

301
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:46,140
When I hang up,I'm going to kill
you,and then your dead body is grounded.

302
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,780
Hi,julian.What's up?

303
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,400
I'm sorry.That's terrible.

304
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,690
So,what does that mean for you?

305
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:02,280
That's soon.

306
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,120
No,take it.Take it.I'll
-- I'll call you later.Bye.

307
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,820
They pulled the plug on the movie.

308
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,110
He's leaving town
soon -- for good.

309
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,610
Looks like youot that
time apart you wished for.

310
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,110
You're evil.You know that?

311
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,100
Well,what tipped you off?Our
miserable marriage or the prison term?

312
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,130
The insidiousness.

313
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,300
How dare you pin keith's murder on me.

314
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,140
It wasn't your fault.

315
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,570
It wasn't my fault.

316
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,710
I know.

317
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,000
So,I thought you were
getting your heart.

318
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,840
Yeah,it's not gonna work out.

319
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,190
Listen,deb,I was wondering if I
could take jamie for a couple hours.

320
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,950
Why,dan?Why would I do that?

321
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,500
Because he's all I have left.

322
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,330
No.Forget it.

323
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,170
You can come with us,deb.It's
just for a little while.

324
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,260
To do what?

325
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,480
To say goodbye.

326
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,700
- Grandpa dan!
- Hey,there's my guy.

327
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,280
Did you get your heart already?

328
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,970
Can I see it?What's it feel like?

329
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,140
Sorry,buddy.It was a false alarm.

330
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,730
Then where's your pager?

331
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,610
Two hours.

332
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,530
Don't make me regret this.

333
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,990
All right,sweetie,grandpa's
gonna take you for a couple hours,

334
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,220
and then I'lsee you for dinner,okay?

335
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,700
Do you want to come with us,nanny deb?

336
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,830
Oh,um,no,honey.

337
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,580
This is where I say goodbye.

338
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,340
Hey,wait for me right outside.

339
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,740
Goodbye,deb.

340
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,890
Don't feel guilty.

341
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,450
I feel guilty.

342
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:51,660
Julian was being  so nice to me,and I
freaked out,and I took it out on sam.

343
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,160
I am a horrible person.

344
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,090
"As a teacher,I must adhere to
a higher standard of conduct,

345
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,990
"and I failed to live up
to that higher standard.

346
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,750
For that,I am truly sorry.

347
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,550
" I'm also sorry principal
rimkus is a hairy-backed bitch.

348
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,180
"Guitar.Play it on guitar.

349
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,060
" That's their great idea.

350
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:12,850
Maybe I can just play it on the
spoons -- a nice spoon ballad.

351
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,920
What the hell's she mean
I'm too good for her?

352
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,260
I'm not too good for
her.Trust me,I know me.

353
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,130
Luke,am I too good for anybody you know?

354
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:25,800
Dude,I just lost $300,000.Do
you understand that?

355
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,530
$300,000.

356
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,180
And you lost deb?Shut up!

357
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,360
What the hell are you doing here?

358
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,610
Celebrating.

359
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,040
I just got paid for doing nothing.

360
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,000
Everybody,drinks on me!

361
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,690
Who's with me?

362
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,190
Yeah,I'm gonna miss it here.

363
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,880
More than you know.

364
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,710
Hey,I got to run.I'll --
I'll see you in L.A. Okay.

365
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,490
Sorry about the movie.

366
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,170
It's okay.

367
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,990
So,you're just gonna leave now?

368
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,160
- Yeah,but it's okay,sam.
- It's not okay.

369
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,030
What about brooke?

370
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,970
That wasn't gonna work out.

371
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,860
You're an idiot if you believe that.

372
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,930
The only reason she
didn't call you back was

373
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,010
because she was mad at me for
shoplifting,and she didn't --

374
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,390
hold on.Shoplifting?What's
-- what's that all about?

375
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,490
I did it for jack.

376
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,670
He was hungry... and
I just took the fall.

377
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,090
What did brooke say about it?

378
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,000
I didn't tell her.

379
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,580
She called me unfixable.

380
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,840
You know she didn't mean that.

381
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,770
Yeah.I know.

382
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,680
She was just mad at
you.I don't get you guys.

383
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,250
One minute,you're making out on the couch,and
the next minute,you're not even talking!

384
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:54,050
What happened?

385
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,470
I told her I loved her.

386
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:59,420
She didn't say it back.

387
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,600
But the movie's over now,so
it doesn't really matter.

388
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,950
No,it does matter.

389
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,910
It's the only thing that matters.

390
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:35,110
You know,jamie... I'm gonna miss watching
you grow into the man you're gonna be someday.

391
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,690
'Cause I know you're gonna
do great things in your life.

392
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,140
You know I'd be there if I could,right?

393
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,140
Come here,buddy.

394
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,880
- Grandpa?
- Yeah?

395
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,610
You wouldn't lie to me,would you?

396
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,920
Of course not.

397
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,330
Because I need to ask you something.

398
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,800
Anything,buddy.

399
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:07,590
Who killed great-uncle keith?

400
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,170
I did.

401
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,670
It was me.

402
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,150
I want to go home.

403
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,860
well,look at it
this way,luke --

404
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,450
you lost a movie and a
huge production bonus.

405
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,440
I lost a movie,a huge pa huge
production bonus,and two amazing girls.

406
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,230
Yeah,what happened with brooke,anyway?

407
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,730
Well,we started out just having fun,but then
she told me she needed to be more than that,

408
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:52,730
so I made it more than that,at which point
she freaked out she just wanted to have fun.

409
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,850
Which made it really not
fun for either of us,sort of.

410
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,640
Hey,you know what -- maybe,uh... maybe
you and brooke will still work it out.

411
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,830
Yeah,we'll see.

412
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,290
"We'll see.

413
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,980
- What?
- It's brooke davis,okay?

414
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,580
So if you don't try,you're an idiot.

415
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,110
Thank you.

416
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,270
Peyton said she came home to find love.

417
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:20,740
Maybe brooke will leave home to find
it with you and your big-ass forehead.

418
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,520
I like to think of it
as a fivehead,thank you.

419
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,830
And,you know,peyton happened to love
it,among other big things I have.

420
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,070
You know,I'm really glad you're leaving.

421
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,010
Here we go.

422
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,430
Oh,geez.

423
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,900
Boys,boys,boys,boys!

424
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,780
Have I taught you nothing this
entire time that I've known you?

425
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:52,190
You have a very small window where
excessive,irresponsib consumption is allowed.

426
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:57,300
For god's sake,drink something expensive,especially
when production is paying for it.

427
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,220
Does anything matter to you,reese?

428
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,480
Now,what is that supposed to mean?

429
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:07,660
Well,look,I mean,julian and i
really wanted to make this movie.

430
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,610
Lucas has a point,reese.You
don't seem that upset.

431
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,750
I get it,you guys.If we had run even one
measly little frame of film through that camera,

432
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,740
you would be sitting on a
huge,fat production bonus.

433
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,900
It's a lot of money.You're upset.

434
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,200
I respect that.

435
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,850
See,that's just it,man.

436
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,450
It's not about the money.

437
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,590
Well,so what's it about,then?

438
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,420
Wait a minute,wait a
minute,wait a minute.

439
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:32,470
I'm not a writer,but... let me
-- let me take a shot at this.

440
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,530
It's that we found a
story worth telling.

441
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,000
We got the script just right,we
got the crew just right,

442
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,310
we got the perfect cast,and we were,oh,

443
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,980
so close to being able to make something
that would actually affect somebody --

444
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:52,080
someone we've never met,but for two hours,we
can have a dialogue with that person,

445
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:57,410
speak to them and maybe
-- I mean,just Maybe --

446
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:02,000
illuminate a small part of their
world by telling a story in ours.

447
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,580
Here's the piece of the
puzzle you boys are missing.

448
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,710
Sometimes... the beauty
is in the attempt.

449
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,570
We took a shot.

450
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,730
We gave it everything we
could,and we did it well.

451
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,510
Just didn't work out.

452
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,480
Now,when that happens,you
got two options.

453
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,590
You could sit in a public
park like a couple of homos,

454
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,110
pouting and drinking cheap beer,or...

455
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,850
you could celebrate the attempt!

456
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,640
Raise your glasses
right now,both of you.

457
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,570
Get them up.

458
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,200
To the friendships we've
made along the way...

459
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,500
and the insane amount of ass
we get for doing this job.

460
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,270
You were so close.

461
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,470
So close.

462
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,220
But,above all,don't
let this get you down.

463
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,530
Pick yourself up,find the next one.

464
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,990
It's what we do,boys.

465
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,610
It's what we know.

466
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,100
See?

467
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:09,550
Look at how happy my baby is that we saved
the movie and she gets to play peyton.

468
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,330
- That's not true.
- But she doesn't know that.

469
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,420
All right,now wait for it.

470
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:22,010
You two dorks are gonna love this one.

471
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,820
Almost forgot!

472
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,730
I left you guys a little
present in the limo!

473
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,550
Seems I ran a little bit of
film through the camera anyway.

474
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,150
It was a sunset last night
-- gorgeous!Had to have it!

475
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,790
You just got your
production bonuses,boys!

476
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,600
But you can't do that!

477
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,910
I just did!

478
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,430
"And when you speak
of me,speak of me well.

479
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,850
"Bull durham.

480
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,730
"You may not like him,minister...
but you can't deny he's got style.

481
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,020
"Harry potter.

482
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,910
You know he charged that
helicopter to the movie.

483
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,040
I've been asked to speak with all
of you because there is a chance

484
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:37,060
I may have shown a
small error in judgment

485
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,300
when I published sam's
essay in the school paper.

486
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:43,980
Which is not to say that sam's essay wasn't
a wonderful piece of writing,because it is.

487
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:46,080
- It's just
that -- ms.Scott.

488
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,380
This is still my classroom.

489
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,790
For now.

490
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,880
What's the first thing I
taught you about writing?

491
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:00,470
- Tell the truth.
- Tell the truth.

492
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:05,850
So I would be a hypocrite if I stood up
here and didn't tell y the truth,right?

493
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:13,260
Look,the truth is,I love teaching all
of you,and I'm -- I'm proud of you.

494
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:17,810
But I did what any good teacher would do when
I published sam's essay in the school paper.

495
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,730
It was a powerful piece of writing.

496
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:24,890
It was honest and naked and real and
everything your writing should be.

497
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,550
And,by the look on principal rimkus'
face,I should probably say goodbye.

498
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:35,960
Ju try and remember it's too early
for you to start playing the game.

499
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,840
Hell,it's too early for me
to start playing the game.

500
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,360
Stand up for what you believe in.

501
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:44,860
The truth matters,so
tell it,no matter what.

502
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,530
Brooke.

503
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,010
I was gonna call you,but...

504
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,190
but I said I loved you,and you didn't
say it back,and I said it was fine.

505
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,770
But it wasn'T.

506
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:11,180
Yeah.

507
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:15,250
I heard about,um,sam and
the whole shoplifting thing.

508
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,500
But the thing is,it wasn't her fault.

509
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:23,760
She was just covering for jack,and,you
know,she promised she wouldn't tell.

510
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,150
I called her unfixable.

511
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,400
I know.

512
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,050
But she's not.

513
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,290
And you know she's
not,because she loves you.

514
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,350
And so do I.

515
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:46,130
And you know what -- that's okay,because
sometimes the beauty is in the attempt.

516
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,400
I got to go.

517
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,010
This is crazy.

518
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,210
I don't want you to go.

519
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,850
And I don't want to go.

520
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,150
But I have to.

521
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,330
Julian,I...

522
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:28,790
I'm gonna miss you,brooke davis.

523
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,790
Usty.

524
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,930
Yeah.

525
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,460
It's like this.

526
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,210
Hey,I'm sorry about the movie,man.

527
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,410
Haley told you,huh?

528
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,970
She tell you she got fired?

529
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,620
I thought she was just suspended.

530
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,980
That was until this morning.

531
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,590
I don't know,man.I leave
town,and everything goes to hell

532
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,030
haley gets fired,movie falls apart.

533
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,110
Dan's heart.

534
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:13,800
Yeah,my,uh,mom called me and told
me there was a problem.What's up?

535
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,670
Oh,he didn't tell you?

536
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,920
No.

537
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,500
Dog ate it.

538
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,270
- What?
- I'm serious.

539
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,880
- A dog ate his heart.
- You're kidding me.

540
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:30,140
I'm standing right there,and this --
this stoner guy's dog trips the paramedic

541
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,440
and... gobbles up his heart.

542
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:37,050
- You're serious?
- I'm not joking.

543
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,410
Yeah.

544
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,730
So,I guess... this means he's gonna die.

545
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,650
I owe you an apology.

546
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,430
Sam.

547
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:48,380
You are not unfixable.

548
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:53,410
Okay?Come here.

549
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,410
I'm sorry,sweetheart.

550
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,720
I'm really sorry.

551
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:07,350
But I found you something
to show you how sorry I am.

552
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,380
No boys in your bedroom.

553
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,680
Well,close the door,you idiot.You
live in a barn or something?

554
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:35,040
You're the idiot.

555
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,400
How'd it go?

556
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,260
How would you like a full-time
producer for mia's record?

557
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,840
Oh,god.What happened?

558
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:50,030
I told the truth!

559
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:53,990
Well,then,yeah.I mean,we would
love a full-time producer.

560
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,130
Excellent!

561
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,210
So,how does "manhattan" sound on guitar?

562
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,660
It's not bad,actually.

563
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,480
Good.

564
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,840
Now,let's put it back.

565
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,390
Mia,when you started out,did you want
to make great records or not-bad records?

566
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,390
- Great records.
- Great,great records.

567
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,100
Good!So that's what we'll do.

568
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:18,710
We'll make a great record,and if the label
can't hear it,then...they can argue with peyton.

569
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,080
Oh,I like this team.

570
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,600
I love this team!

571
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:35,300
So,you're good here?

572
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:38,210
I'm good.

573
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:44,900
Okay.Well,I'll...see
you in the morning,then.

574
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:47,130
Yeah.

575
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:58,100
I'm glad you're here.

576
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,570
Me too.

577
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,460
You're my sons.

578
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:24,150
And I failed you.

579
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:29,400
I'm sorry for that and
for so many other things.

580
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:35,100
But I'm proud that each of you have become
the kind of man that I could never be.

581
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,570
You're good men.

582
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:40,820
And yore good brothers.

583
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,040
Don't let the world change that.

584
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,400
james lucas scott,what
are you still doing awake?

585
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,650
I'm making tree hill.

586
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,080
See?That's quentin.

587
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,280
He's still alive here.

588
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,150
That's nice.

589
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,290
And this is our house.

590
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,050
And that's daddy and you and me.

591
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:55,510
And uncle lucas and
peyton live next door.

592
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,550
Cool.

593
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,680
And this is brooke and sam and julian.

594
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,700
Is that grandpa dan?

595
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,780
Yeah.He has a new heart.

596
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,240
Who's that,sweetie?

597
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:11,850
That's uncle keith.He's still alive.

598
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:17,290
He came to make sure grandpa dan was okay,because
him and grandpa dan still love each other.

599
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,170
Okay,jamie,it's time for bed.

600
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,370
Say good night to tree hill.

601
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,120
good night to tree hill.
