1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:01,544
Previously on "one Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:01,734 --> 00:00:03,017
You were at that party that night,

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,885
and you got pregnant.

4
00:00:04,968 --> 00:00:07,033
But you didn't have sex
with Nathan Scott, did you?

5
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:09,300
No.

6
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:11,934
He says she's dropping everything.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,501
Maybe we need a vacation.

8
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,484
The Bahamas?

9
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:21,384
Tree Hill.

10
00:00:21,467 --> 00:00:23,651
It's almost morning. I should go.

11
00:00:23,734 --> 00:00:26,217
Or, uh...

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,334
you could stay.

13
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:31,117
Administrative work is
for fatties, Millicent,

14
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,718
and you are not a fatty.

15
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:35,050
You...

16
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:37,351
are a plus-size model.

17
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:40,151
Honey, I'm home. Let's do this.

18
00:00:40,234 --> 00:00:41,618
I told you it was realistic.

19
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:44,317
Hey, honey. Alex and I
worked everything out.

20
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,267
Isn't that great?

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,333
Hey.

22
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:06,384
Uh-oh... the look,
followed by the pout.

23
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:10,951
I just missed you next
to me last night... again.

24
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:12,150
I know, baby.

25
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:14,384
Alex and I didn't
finish until 4:00 a.m.

26
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:16,867
I know. I watched her
leave on my sneaky-slut cam.

27
00:01:18,534 --> 00:01:19,818
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:22,150
I'm really trying to be
super-evolved girlfriend,

29
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:23,384
but it's hard for me

30
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:25,718
when my boyfriend
spends all of his nights

31
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:28,284
writing an epic love story
with naked-actress girl.

32
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:29,618
She's not naked.

33
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:31,751
She's always naked in my mind.

34
00:01:31,834 --> 00:01:33,317
P.S.... not a good time

35
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,333
to insert obvious
girl-on-girl humor.

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,150
Hey.

37
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,517
I love you.

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,184
And I know me working with
Alex has been really hard.

39
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:45,484
Excruciating.

40
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:48,317
And I appreciate how
understanding you've been.

41
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,018
But here's some good news.

42
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:52,918
I think we're finally gonna
finish the script today.

43
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:54,484
"Finish" as in "done"?

44
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:56,985
As in "no more late
nights with Alex"?

45
00:01:57,068 --> 00:01:58,484
And lots of late nights

46
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:00,901
with the most beautiful girl I know.

47
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:08,551
They're offering two
years. I say no deal.

48
00:02:08,634 --> 00:02:09,851
It's not bad.

49
00:02:09,934 --> 00:02:11,018
It's B.S.

50
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:12,351
Look at your numbers
last season, man.

51
00:02:12,434 --> 00:02:13,718
I mean, all the team is trying to do

52
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,317
is take advantage of the
bad press around Renee.

53
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,751
Okay, so, right now,

54
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:19,217
her lie is making my
name less valuable.

55
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,851
But not your game.

56
00:02:20,934 --> 00:02:22,551
That's why we're countering.

57
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:25,150
I'm gonna ask for four
years. We'll take three.

58
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:27,618
They offered two,
and we ask for four?

59
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:29,618
It's how the game is played, Nate.

60
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:32,651
You're sure they won't stop playing?

61
00:02:32,734 --> 00:02:35,451
Buddy, trust me.

62
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:36,517
They won't.

63
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,451
Just let me do my job.

64
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:39,818
All right.

65
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:41,951
It's my job to look good, bitch.

66
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:45,684
Mils, you've been raping
my closet for two weeks.

67
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:49,150
You should be wearing
C.O.B., not... M-E.

68
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:51,150
I've been seen in all my C.O.B.
clothes.

69
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:52,417
What about the new stuff?

70
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,484
That dress ball and chain
Brooke was working on

71
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:55,918
would be the shiz on you.

72
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:57,985
I know, but Brooke
isn't done with it yet,

73
00:02:58,068 --> 00:02:59,951
not to mention super
uber-assistant Calliope

74
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:01,884
is guarding it like
a virgin's vajayjay.

75
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:04,085
And since all my old
clothes are so Millie 1.0,

76
00:03:04,168 --> 00:03:07,085
your closet is my only
high-rnd alternative.

77
00:03:07,168 --> 00:03:09,818
Oh, my God. I'm so sleepy,
and you're so talky.

78
00:03:09,901 --> 00:03:11,217
Sorry. Still wired.

79
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,384
Late night, major party...
you totally missed it.

80
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:14,718
Doubt it.

81
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:17,317
The party scene is so lame-tarded.

82
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,951
It's the same people,
same paparazzi, same porn.

83
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,551
Porn?

84
00:03:22,634 --> 00:03:25,701
In the VIP's VIP it's way overrated.

85
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:29,784
You know, I'm starting to
like just hanging with Julian

86
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:31,951
and working on stuff
people take seriously

87
00:03:32,034 --> 00:03:34,134
other than my tight ass.

88
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,718
O.M. Gucci!

89
00:03:39,801 --> 00:03:42,718
Score me some of what you've
been taking, you skinny bitch.

90
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:44,784
You totally look
better than me in that.

91
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:45,784
Really?

92
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:47,200
Take it off.

93
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,901
Wow. That good?

94
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,500
Hmm.

95
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:00,434
Good God.

96
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:05,634
Millie!

97
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:36,918
"Haley James Scott,
tonight at 8:00"...

98
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,218
And I can't even
utter the last part.

99
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:41,251
Free. The concert is free.

100
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:43,984
One more time, and I will
wash your mouth out with soap.

101
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:46,351
Please explain how
this impromptu concert

102
00:04:46,434 --> 00:04:48,384
is getting your album
completed on shedule.

103
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:51,184
Only if you explain to me
the deal with "shedule."

104
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:53,984
Come on, Miranda, I just
wanted to get out of the studio

105
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:56,518
and, you know, get some
feedback on my new songs.

106
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:58,518
You'll get feedback in 2 1/2 months,

107
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:00,984
when the record is done and the
downloads are making the label money.

108
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,884
And then you'll be "free" to perform

109
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:05,351
at any label-authorized concert.

110
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:08,685
In the meantime, this one...

111
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:10,051
is off.

112
00:05:10,134 --> 00:05:13,434
Okay, but you're gonna
have to tell them.

113
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:17,768
Go on. I'll hold the door open.

114
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:22,933
Well, Americans will line
up for anything that's free.

115
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:28,384
Look, we're not talking about
a rookie getting his feet wet.

116
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:29,850
This is Nathan Scott.

117
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:32,451
Just look at his numbers,
and I think you'll understand

118
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:35,667
why we feel that he's
earned a four-year deal.

119
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:39,917
Yeah.

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,384
Or we might consider a three-year

121
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:42,651
if the price is right,

122
00:05:42,734 --> 00:05:45,251
but a two is not
gonna get us anywhere.

123
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:46,834
I hope so.

124
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:50,318
Mmm. Thanks.

125
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:52,217
Best part of my day.

126
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,017
Me or the coffee?

127
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,634
Maybe a little bit of both.

128
00:05:57,401 --> 00:05:58,917
So, any good news?

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,117
Uh, we'll see.
Now I just have to wait.

130
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,251
Mm. How would you feel
about waiting with me?

131
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:05,318
Come on. I have somewhere
I want to take you.

132
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:07,234
Grab your office.

133
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:14,768
It's good to be home.

134
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,917
So, this is your
dirty little secret?

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,084
Yeah... I've been helping out here

136
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:35,651
every saturday for
a couple of hours.

137
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:38,151
Hales and I used to do it
in high school, you know...

138
00:06:38,234 --> 00:06:39,850
hippie parents, raised to
give back. Hi, miss Quinn!

139
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,218
Hi.

140
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,800
I guess I kind of missed it.

141
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:46,451
Hey, you let me in. I
just wanted to let you in.

142
00:06:46,534 --> 00:06:47,518
Hey, Miss Quinn.

143
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:48,884
Hi.

144
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:50,651
Wow.

145
00:06:50,734 --> 00:06:52,951
Great spiral, great listener,

146
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:55,618
and now this hot
Mother Teresa thing?

147
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:58,618
You know, in girl world, you
just called me hot, right?

148
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:00,218
In an old-nun sort of way.

149
00:07:00,301 --> 00:07:01,251
Oh, okay, yeah.

150
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:04,084
So, what exactly do you
do here, sister Quinn?

151
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:06,485
Well...
we make these homemade cameras,

152
00:07:06,568 --> 00:07:08,784
and then we take pictures with them.

153
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:11,151
You know, the first time
I looked through my lens,

154
00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:13,884
I realized that I could find
magic in unexpected places.

155
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,451
And I want the kids to feel that.

156
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:17,934
Pretty dorky, huh?

157
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:21,067
Completely dorky, yeah.

158
00:07:23,434 --> 00:07:25,784
I love it.

159
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:27,851
Mm. It's just a sample.

160
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:30,817
It's top-secret C.O.B.
for next March.

161
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,717
I just finished it today.

162
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,451
Here is your super-sassy
rock-star comeback outfit.

163
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:37,751
I want you to look
so amazing up there.

164
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:40,451
I mean, you could just let me
wear this one to my show tonight.

165
00:07:40,534 --> 00:07:42,485
I could,
but then I'd have to kill you.

166
00:07:42,568 --> 00:07:44,584
And if you're dead, we can't talk.

167
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:48,667
And.. .I really need a huge
Haley heart-to-heart right now.

168
00:07:50,101 --> 00:07:51,900
All righty.

169
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:54,385
Spill.

170
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:56,851
I think I'm pregnant.

171
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,917
I'm late, and I am never
late. And I'm freaking out.

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,118
Why are you freaking out?

173
00:08:01,201 --> 00:08:02,784
You've wanted a baby
since you were 22.

174
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:05,517
Because I don't know how
Julian's gonna take it.

175
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,318
The last time we
talked about our future,

176
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:09,351
he basically said "what's the rush?"

177
00:08:09,434 --> 00:08:11,617
I am fluent in boy,
and I am pretty sure

178
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,451
That "what's the rush?" Doesn't
mean "let's have a baby now."

179
00:08:15,534 --> 00:08:18,584
Maybe not, but things
happen all the time...

180
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:22,418
Unexpected things that turn
out to be amazing things.

181
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:24,418
I named mine Jamie.

182
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:26,184
Yeah, but with all the Alex drama,

183
00:08:26,267 --> 00:08:29,118
I just wouldn't want him to
think that I was expecting it.

184
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:31,550
Oh, Brooke, Julian's not gonna
think you got pregnant on purpose.

185
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:33,284
Come on, Hales, you have to admit

186
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:35,018
The timing looks a bit suspect.

187
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:38,051
No. You know what? Julian loves you.

188
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:40,817
Stop worrying. Go to the doctor.

189
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,751
It's your turn to be the girl

190
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:44,751
who gets the baby and the boy.

191
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:48,018
So, the girl doesn't get the boy.

192
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:49,784
No. That's what makes
the ending work.

193
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:51,251
She doesn't need the boy anymore.

194
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:53,184
Says the boy.

195
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,251
Not that you're the boy... jst a boy

196
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:58,051
who doesn't get that some
sad girl with bad hair

197
00:08:58,134 --> 00:09:00,385
doesn't want to spend
money on a movie

198
00:09:00,468 --> 00:09:02,218
where the girl doesn't get the boy.

199
00:09:02,301 --> 00:09:03,650
It's not American.

200
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:06,118
The ending is perfect as is.

201
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:07,550
Trust me.

202
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:09,267
Now, a little drumroll, please.

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,884
And we're done. That's it.

204
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:14,851
Fade out. Hit "print."

205
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:16,851
What about all your
annoyingly good notes?

206
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:18,084
You did them all.

207
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:20,251
You've been so focused
these past few weeks.

208
00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:22,817
Now it's just time to kick
the script out of the nest,

209
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,600
see if it can fly.

210
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:28,617
My dad used to say that.

211
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,517
So, what's next, then, Mr. Producer?

212
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,851
Well, I'll just put out some
feelers, make a few calls,

213
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:34,917
see if anyone responds
to the material.

214
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,218
Which is, like, a no-brainer.
This script is the bomb.

215
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:38,485
I'll be sure to lead with that.

216
00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:39,751
Good.

217
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:41,717
And I'll work on scoring
production offices

218
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,118
with expensive water
and a snobby temp.

219
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:45,385
We'll be so legit.

220
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:46,884
Whoa. We got to still
sell the script.

221
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:48,251
That could take months.

222
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:51,218
So we won't be seeing each
other every day anymore?

223
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:55,018
No, ma'am.
You are officially off duty.

224
00:09:55,101 --> 00:09:56,951
Oh.

225
00:09:57,034 --> 00:09:59,000
Sweet.

226
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,134
You have no new messages.

227
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:11,550
Nice shot.

228
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:12,900
You got another one of those?

229
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:20,851
You're good.

230
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:22,584
You got an agent?

231
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,867
Don't need your charity
today, all right?

232
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:29,118
So, you staring, or you playing?

233
00:10:29,201 --> 00:10:31,034
Playing.

234
00:10:40,468 --> 00:10:41,900
Hello, Nathan.

235
00:10:47,101 --> 00:10:47,534
It's grandpa Dan.

236
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:50,617
I saw it on the security cam.
Jamie...

237
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,684
Grandpa Dan!

238
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:53,951
Hey, there, buddy.

239
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:56,034
Oh, warm welcome.

240
00:10:57,901 --> 00:11:01,101
Nathan,
you remember my wife, Rachel.

241
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,451
Yes.

242
00:11:03,534 --> 00:11:05,134
Of course.

243
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,384
Well, when you and deb are
tired of my high-School class,

244
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,850
I'm sure I could rummage

245
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:12,251
Through some of my old
middle-School friends for you.

246
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:14,518
It's good to see you, too, Nathan.

247
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:17,917
It's funny... I used to
want you to be my daddy.

248
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,334
And now I'm your mommy.

249
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,084
Nice to meet you, grandma Rachel.

250
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:24,584
Aww.

251
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,151
I remember when you were
a rumor in third period.

252
00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:30,200
Dad, can I show grandpa
Dan my new room?

253
00:11:33,134 --> 00:11:35,334
Yes. Yes, of course you can, son.

254
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,351
I haven't seen you
around here before.

255
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:49,851
First time... helping out a friend.

256
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:52,184
Yeah, I saw you with
the camera lady.

257
00:11:52,267 --> 00:11:53,534
She your girl?

258
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:57,017
No.

259
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,418
Why not? She's pretty.

260
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,518
You got a lot of questions.

261
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,418
My turn. You got a name?

262
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:04,201
Nope.

263
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:11,884
I know what you're doing...

264
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:13,884
you're letting the poor kid win.

265
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:14,984
That's what you all do...

266
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,750
show up, volunteer for a few hours,

267
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,617
make yourselves feel
good about whatever.

268
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,518
So, what's your thing?

269
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:23,800
You a bad dad or something?

270
00:12:28,668 --> 00:12:31,900
I lost my wife a few years back.

271
00:12:33,267 --> 00:12:34,851
What was her name?

272
00:12:34,934 --> 00:12:36,234
Sara.

273
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:44,700
My mom died, too.

274
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,084
Do you want to talk about it?

275
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:51,467
What's that gonna do?

276
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:54,367
I used to think the same thing.

277
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:59,518
I had a bunch of memories of her,

278
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:02,351
my own secrets.

279
00:13:02,434 --> 00:13:04,884
And I thought that if I talked
about her with anyone else

280
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:06,750
that those memories would go away.

281
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,717
I wouldn't have our secrets anymore,

282
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,451
and maybe I'd start to forget.

283
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:13,051
And did you? Forget?

284
00:13:13,134 --> 00:13:15,568
Not one thing.

285
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,534
Sometimes I feel like
she's still here with me.

286
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,017
She is.

287
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,017
She always will be.

288
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,301
Moms are special that way.

289
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:56,017
Brooke Davis.

290
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,451
You ready?

291
00:13:57,534 --> 00:13:59,800
I've been ready.

292
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:04,650
Paul Norris.

293
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:06,485
Hey, dad. It's me.

294
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:08,118
Julian.

295
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:10,684
It's good to hear from
you, son. How are you?

296
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,051
How's Brooke?

297
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:13,784
She's good. We're good.

298
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:16,251
I'm happy to hear that.

299
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:17,485
So, I've been working.

300
00:14:17,568 --> 00:14:19,617
And I found a script
that I really like.

301
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,551
I'm thinking about sending it out.

302
00:14:21,634 --> 00:14:23,750
Ah. Kick it out of the nest.

303
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,401
See if it can fly.

304
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:30,367
I think you said to me about a
thousand times when I was a kid.

305
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:33,851
So, dad, listen, I, um...

306
00:14:33,934 --> 00:14:36,784
I wanted to see if you'd
want to produce it with me.

307
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:39,284
I mean, it's nothing
huge. It's an indie.

308
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:42,485
But... it's about second chances.

309
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:45,251
And...

310
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:47,451
I don't know...
it made me think of us.

311
00:14:47,534 --> 00:14:50,051
I'd like that, son.

312
00:14:50,134 --> 00:14:51,733
Very much.

313
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,451
This is some collection.

314
00:14:57,534 --> 00:14:59,650
Look at this one... Jerry Rice.

315
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:00,817
Whoa!

316
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,451
I got it for my birthday.

317
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:03,867
I'm 7 now.

318
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,251
I know.

319
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:09,318
I'm sorry I missed that.

320
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:12,051
I'm sorry I missed a lot of
things over this past year.

321
00:15:12,134 --> 00:15:14,301
I forgive you.

322
00:15:15,668 --> 00:15:17,851
I always hoped you were watching.

323
00:15:17,934 --> 00:15:20,817
I never missed it. I
pretended like you never left.

324
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,017
I like that big clock
thing that hangs behind you,

325
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,134
'cause it means you're okay,
even if you're still sick.

326
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,851
I'm glad you're home again.

327
00:15:30,934 --> 00:15:32,900
Me too, buddy.

328
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:44,650
Surprise!

329
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:45,851
Rachel.

330
00:15:45,934 --> 00:15:47,817
Uh, what are you doing here?

331
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,700
Waiting for a hello hug
from my favorite boy!

332
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:03,668
Miss Davis.

333
00:16:06,534 --> 00:16:09,917
I'm... sorry, but the
test came back negative.

334
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,251
E... excuse me?

335
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:14,401
You're not pregnant.

336
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:26,467
So, you and mom went to high
school with grandma Rachel?

337
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:30,184
Were you friends?

338
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:32,951
Um, I'm not really sure grandma
Rachel was friends with anyone.

339
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,050
Like grandpa Dan?

340
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:37,100
I'm glad they have each other.

341
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:39,985
Yeah.

342
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:42,851
They're a perfect match.

343
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:44,684
Dad...

344
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:46,784
I have a secret.

345
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:49,751
Sometimes I watch grandpa Dan on tv.

346
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:52,885
I know I'm not supposed to.
I'm sorry.

347
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:56,217
No, Jamie, it's okay. I
knew you were watching.

348
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,985
And it's okay for you to miss him.

349
00:16:58,068 --> 00:16:59,317
He loves you.

350
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,184
He loves you, too. He
watched all the Bobcats games.

351
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:03,384
And... Jamie.

352
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:04,718
Dad, he's different now.

353
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:06,684
He helps people, like he
helped us with that lady

354
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:08,267
who was trying to hurt you and mom.

355
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:11,518
Yeah.

356
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:14,300
Well, there's things between
us you can't understand, Jamie.

357
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,684
I'm not a little kid anymore.

358
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:20,434
I understand a lot of things.

359
00:17:25,968 --> 00:17:27,284
I know you do.

360
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:30,351
I wish you didn't have to.

361
00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:35,334
Dad, it's only three
words... "I forgive you."

362
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:41,701
Shoot it.

363
00:17:43,601 --> 00:17:44,767
Aw!

364
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,284
So, um...

365
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,284
How's life in L.A.?

366
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:52,017
It's great.

367
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,150
You can be anybody you want there.

368
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:56,217
And who are you?

369
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,784
Rachel Scott...

370
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:02,718
Dan's ex-screw-up of a wife
who has changed her life

371
00:18:02,801 --> 00:18:05,618
with the positive
words of Dan Scott.

372
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:07,050
It's genius.

373
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:10,017
So, I guess Dan helped
you step into the light

374
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,484
and get yourself right.

375
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:12,885
Mm.

376
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,885
Dan helped me step into the light

377
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,885
and get myself a personal trainer,

378
00:18:16,968 --> 00:18:18,551
a driver, and a black card.

379
00:18:18,634 --> 00:18:20,701
Same Rachel, different city.

380
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,551
So, are we gonna talk about Brooke?

381
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:27,217
I mean, have you seen her?

382
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,885
No.

383
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:30,200
And I don't want to.

384
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:35,684
I know I messed up last time,

385
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:39,217
but she and Victoria
blackballed me in the industry.

386
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,484
Even after I got sober,
I couldn't get a gig.

387
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:46,084
Then I got unsober and ended
up shaking my ass on a pole.

388
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,184
I'm sorry that happened to you,

389
00:18:48,267 --> 00:18:50,184
but none of it was Brooke's fault.

390
00:18:50,267 --> 00:18:52,217
So, what... you're on her side?

391
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,751
You were her friend.

392
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:55,484
She went out on a limb for you,

393
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,518
and you repaid her
by stealing money.

394
00:18:57,601 --> 00:18:59,233
So, yeah, I'm kind of on her side.

395
00:19:00,701 --> 00:19:02,251
Go see her.

396
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:04,034
You owe her that.

397
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:12,784
I guess I was late
because of stress.

398
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:16,651
Julian, Alex, the new line...

399
00:19:16,734 --> 00:19:18,017
It's okay.

400
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,084
It'll happen.

401
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:22,317
When you guys are ready,
it'll happen.

402
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,885
Brooke.

403
00:19:23,968 --> 00:19:25,684
Hey.

404
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:28,518
You were so meant to be a mom.

405
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,117
You are gonna have a houseful

406
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,050
of very fashionably dressed
little Brooke Davises

407
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:36,251
running around.

408
00:19:36,334 --> 00:19:38,367
You wait and see.

409
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:41,300
Yeah.

410
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:50,417
So, this is your cave?

411
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,518
Yeah, we can't all have
pimped-out beach houses

412
00:19:52,601 --> 00:19:54,050
to hide in.

413
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:57,484
Says the woman whose cave is
in an nba player's mansion.

414
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,451
Touché.

415
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:01,451
But I'm thinking about getting back

416
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,150
to my artist roots, you know?

417
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:06,251
Crampy, old apartments with
character and creaky floors...

418
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:07,985
they make the best caves.

419
00:20:08,068 --> 00:20:10,050
So you're staying in Tree Hill?

420
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:11,751
For a while.

421
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:14,284
You know, it's home. I like it here.

422
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:17,133
Plus, you know, the
company isn't horrible.

423
00:20:20,034 --> 00:20:21,384
Beautiful.

424
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:22,351
It is.

425
00:20:22,434 --> 00:20:24,050
This is what I love...

426
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:26,284
you know,
standing in the pitch black,

427
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:28,150
waiting for the smallest moment

428
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:30,334
to reveal itself right
before your eyes.

429
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,818
I have to take this.

430
00:20:37,901 --> 00:20:40,484
I... hope it's what I want to hear.

431
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:42,534
Oh, you're super agent. It will be.

432
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:45,367
Hey.

433
00:20:46,834 --> 00:20:48,251
Today?

434
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:50,050
Are we sure?

435
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:53,017
Yeah, that's great.
Just keep me posted.

436
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,284
Good news?

437
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:57,734
Just a rumor, but,
uh, yeah, I think so.

438
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:00,751
So, I should get going.

439
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:02,718
Yeah.

440
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:04,818
But I'll see you tonight
at Haley's concert?

441
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:06,017
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

442
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,117
Okay.

443
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,968
Oh.

444
00:21:11,034 --> 00:21:12,951
We're not working tonight, Alex.

445
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:14,651
I know,
but I just reread the script,

446
00:21:14,734 --> 00:21:16,050
and it totally sucks ducks.

447
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:18,484
I mean, the main character
is total white noise.

448
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:21,518
She needs, like, a... a crack habit
or a... a brother with cancer...

449
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:22,918
something oscar-worthy.

450
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:24,417
The script is awesome.

451
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,818
Trust yourself. We did good work.

452
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:27,684
But I... I just... Good night, Alex.

453
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:29,184
I have plans with Brooke.

454
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:31,001
But...

455
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:34,751
I'm just...

456
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:36,818
never really good at being alone.

457
00:21:36,901 --> 00:21:38,718
Come on. Stop it. Go live your life.

458
00:21:38,801 --> 00:21:40,534
You're Alex Dupré.

459
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,584
Well, well. This is
quite the crowd, isn't it?

460
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:55,584
Yeah, I can't believe
all these people showed up

461
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:56,951
after so many years.

462
00:21:57,034 --> 00:21:58,251
I know.

463
00:21:58,334 --> 00:22:01,150
There is a lot of people
out there... just waiting.

464
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:02,618
Wow.

465
00:22:02,701 --> 00:22:04,484
So... nervous?

466
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:06,417
'Cause I heard you get
a bit of stage fright.

467
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,184
Oh, no. Actually, I'm
not nervous at all.

468
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:10,351
I'm just looking forward
to getting back out there.

469
00:22:10,434 --> 00:22:12,050
Really? Because I'd be nervous.

470
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:14,284
I mean, after all, if
the music's no good,

471
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:16,451
it'll be all over
Youtube by tomorrow.

472
00:22:16,534 --> 00:22:18,651
And then you'll have to explain
to the label what you were thinking

473
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:21,551
when you put together this
premature little free concert

474
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:23,985
that could ruin any good buzz we
have about your up-and-coming album.

475
00:22:24,068 --> 00:22:26,050
Ohh.

476
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:27,167
See? Now I'm nervous.

477
00:22:28,734 --> 00:22:30,618
Break a leg.

478
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:33,667
That's funny... "leg" wasn't
my first option for you.

479
00:22:39,068 --> 00:22:42,001
Live your life, Alex.

480
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:48,251
Mm.

481
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:49,867
Can I get another?

482
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:53,051
Hey, baby.

483
00:22:53,134 --> 00:22:54,851
Hi.

484
00:22:54,934 --> 00:22:56,751
I hope that's champagne
you just ordered,

485
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,817
'cause we're celebrating
tonight, remember?

486
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,334
Right... we're celebrating.

487
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:05,900
I'll be right back.

488
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:16,617
I told you I'm with Brooke tonight.

489
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,517
No games, Alex.

490
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,285
This isn't a game. I swear.

491
00:23:21,368 --> 00:23:24,051
I found some coke in my suitcase.

492
00:23:24,134 --> 00:23:26,218
What have you done?

493
00:23:26,301 --> 00:23:28,651
Nothing... yet.

494
00:23:28,734 --> 00:23:31,584
But I'm thinking about it.

495
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:33,617
I don't want to mess up.

496
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,884
Okay, look, calm down.

497
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:37,918
Please come.

498
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,767
Please.

499
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:45,134
Okay, just don't do
anything. I'm on my way, okay?

500
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:53,567
Okay.

501
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:58,351
What's up, bud? Hey.

502
00:23:58,434 --> 00:24:00,651
I hope that grin means you
had a good day at the office.

503
00:24:00,734 --> 00:24:02,417
I'm hearing good things.

504
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,184
That's awesome.

505
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:06,218
I don't think I could take
any more bad news today.

506
00:24:06,301 --> 00:24:07,984
What's up?

507
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:09,385
You okay?

508
00:24:09,468 --> 00:24:12,218
Yeah, I'm fine. It's
just... it's family stuff.

509
00:24:12,301 --> 00:24:13,385
All right.

510
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:16,018
Chase, my man, I'm in a good mood.

511
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:19,617
So I'm gonna have one of those
tasty blue brain blasters.

512
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,550
You could have told me they sucked.

513
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:23,351
Come on. Who said that?

514
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:25,184
They sucked, and you know it.

515
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:28,484
And that's why, from now on,
I'm officially just bar manager.

516
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,584
But who's gonna bring
me my shots and beers?

517
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:34,084
All right. Hey, Grubbs.

518
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:37,951
Guys, this is Grubbs,
my new bartender.

519
00:24:38,034 --> 00:24:39,584
Clay here wants a drink.

520
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:41,184
What do you think?

521
00:24:41,267 --> 00:24:44,285
Shot of tequila, chilled,
and a beer, imported.

522
00:24:44,368 --> 00:24:46,734
No... hip domestic.

523
00:24:47,867 --> 00:24:49,450
Nice.

524
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:51,351
Wow. That's pretty impressive.

525
00:24:51,434 --> 00:24:53,767
Yeah, I know. That guy sucks.

526
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,450
Here.

527
00:24:58,533 --> 00:24:59,851
Thanks, Grubbs.

528
00:24:59,934 --> 00:25:02,318
Well... to you.

529
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:04,051
Thanks for all the hard work.

530
00:25:04,134 --> 00:25:06,784
And here's to next season
not being a contract year.

531
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:07,784
Congrats, man.

532
00:25:07,867 --> 00:25:09,734
Cheers.

533
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,251
Hey, Nate. Hey.

534
00:25:13,334 --> 00:25:15,517
Clay. Hey, Quinn.

535
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,218
Oh, hey, check this out.

536
00:25:17,301 --> 00:25:19,784
Grubbs, this is Quinn.

537
00:25:19,867 --> 00:25:20,817
Hey.

538
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,967
She needs a drink.

539
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,468
White wine's gonna
make you both happy.

540
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:30,301
Wow. He's better than Zelda.

541
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,484
Hey! Oh, my gosh!

542
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:42,584
I've been gone a long time.

543
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:45,184
But, uh, I'm back. It feels good.

544
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:48,285
Anyway, I want to show you
guys some of my new songs.

545
00:25:48,368 --> 00:25:50,285
And, uh... thanks for showing up.

546
00:25:50,368 --> 00:25:51,967
I hope you like it.

547
00:27:00,468 --> 00:27:03,684
What do you mean you're on
your way to Alex's hotel room?

548
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:05,550
Brooke, I'm sorry. She's in trouble.

549
00:27:05,633 --> 00:27:07,218
And of course she called you.

550
00:27:07,301 --> 00:27:08,817
Well, I didn't really have a choice.

551
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,251
She said she found some cocaine

552
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:11,651
and she thinks she may relapse.

553
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:13,984
I... I can't just leave her alone.

554
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:15,484
She sounded really bad.

555
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,251
She's an actress, Julian!

556
00:27:18,334 --> 00:27:19,867
I'll hurry back. I promise.

557
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:39,984
Boo!

558
00:27:40,067 --> 00:27:41,184
Hey. Where have you been?

559
00:27:41,267 --> 00:27:42,517
I called, but you didn't answer.

560
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,984
I know. Sorry. I had to
drop by work for a sec.

561
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:45,450
You like?

562
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:48,118
You look great. But
you always looks great.

563
00:27:48,201 --> 00:27:49,984
You always say that, Mouth.

564
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:52,184
You called me "Mouth."

565
00:27:52,267 --> 00:27:54,234
You never call me "Mouth."

566
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:19,018
What the hell are you wearing?

567
00:28:19,101 --> 00:28:21,385
It's great, Brooke. I love it.

568
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:24,151
You know that dress is not supposed
to be released until next summer,

569
00:28:24,234 --> 00:28:26,118
so unless I magically
went to sleep for a year,

570
00:28:26,201 --> 00:28:28,385
you need to explain to me
why you're wearing it tonight.

571
00:28:28,468 --> 00:28:32,151
I thought it would be fine.
I mean, I'm the face of C.O.B.

572
00:28:32,234 --> 00:28:34,184
Millicent Huxtable,

573
00:28:34,267 --> 00:28:36,851
that dress needs to
leave this bar right now,

574
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:38,684
on or off you.

575
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:41,517
Your choice or your job.

576
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,218
Someone needs to chill out.

577
00:28:44,301 --> 00:28:45,484
It's just a dress.

578
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:47,251
And there's no one
important in here, anyway.

579
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:49,918
"No one important"? What's
that supposed to mean?

580
00:28:50,001 --> 00:28:53,218
I mean, it's Tric,
not the Music Awards.

581
00:28:53,301 --> 00:28:55,617
Is that why you're taking pills...

582
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,318
so you can go look fab

583
00:28:57,401 --> 00:28:59,717
at someplace important,
like the Music Awards?

584
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,084
You were going through my stuff?

585
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:02,550
Your stuff was all over the room.

586
00:29:02,633 --> 00:29:04,051
And that's not what's
important here.

587
00:29:04,134 --> 00:29:05,218
I'm worried about you.

588
00:29:05,301 --> 00:29:06,550
Worried about what?

589
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:07,817
You're different...

590
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,550
Blowing Brooke off,
messing up at work,

591
00:29:09,633 --> 00:29:11,617
partying all the time,
and now these pills.

592
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,517
So I took a few diet
pills to drop a few pounds.

593
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,651
So what?

594
00:29:16,734 --> 00:29:18,784
Brooke hired you for who you are.

595
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:20,784
You don't have to change that.

596
00:29:20,867 --> 00:29:22,717
I don't just have to please Brooke.

597
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,184
There's an entire industry.

598
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:26,018
It's a lot of pressure to fit in.

599
00:29:26,101 --> 00:29:27,550
And for once, I want to fit in.

600
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:29,717
God, marvin, you told
me you supported me.

601
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,251
I wanted you to be a model

602
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:33,118
because it made you feel special.

603
00:29:33,201 --> 00:29:35,884
And that's sweet and noble

604
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:38,351
and one of the reasons
why I love you.

605
00:29:38,434 --> 00:29:40,218
But it's not that simple.

606
00:29:40,301 --> 00:29:42,867
I wish it were, but it's not.

607
00:29:49,234 --> 00:29:50,584
I'm sorry.

608
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:52,817
Stop saying you're sorry.

609
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,918
You're just the only
one I could call

610
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,784
who wouldn't want to do it with me

611
00:29:56,867 --> 00:29:58,517
or report it to the tabloids.

612
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,118
What about your sponsor from rehab?

613
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:02,984
Rehab was for publicity.

614
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,717
My sponsor isn't good for anything

615
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,700
besides scoring the best blow.

616
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:10,984
The only time I stopped doing it

617
00:30:11,067 --> 00:30:13,001
was when I started working with you.

618
00:30:14,434 --> 00:30:16,684
I'm not trying to pressure you.

619
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:19,484
It's just the truth.

620
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,550
Well, I'll take it and go.

621
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:24,318
But I could just go
out and get more.

622
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:25,285
Would you?

623
00:30:25,368 --> 00:30:27,633
I don't know.

624
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,934
Right now, I want it so bad.

625
00:30:37,533 --> 00:30:39,951
Tonight was hard.

626
00:30:40,034 --> 00:30:43,101
I didn't have anywhere to go.

627
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:47,334
It was so quiet in here.

628
00:30:50,034 --> 00:30:52,018
And I hate myself when it's quiet.

629
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:54,651
Hey. Alex.

630
00:30:54,734 --> 00:30:55,800
Hey.

631
00:30:57,533 --> 00:31:00,550
You are so much more than you see.

632
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:03,918
The girl I've been working
with is bright and funny

633
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:06,118
and independent and
strong all by herself.

634
00:31:06,201 --> 00:31:08,001
She doesn't need that stuff.

635
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:12,734
I wish I could see her.

636
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:20,951
Let's just get you
through tonight...

637
00:31:21,034 --> 00:31:23,567
and hopefully you will.

638
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,051
The playbaounds great.

639
00:31:32,134 --> 00:31:33,617
Playback? I recorded a little bit.

640
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,851
You know, I thought we could
"accidentally" leak a song,

641
00:31:35,934 --> 00:31:37,285
get the fans excited for more.

642
00:31:37,368 --> 00:31:40,285
This little concert was genius.

643
00:31:40,368 --> 00:31:42,417
I'm so glad I thought of it.

644
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,584
Yeah, me too.

645
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:45,018
Studio tomorrow, bright and early.

646
00:31:45,101 --> 00:31:46,351
Where are you headed?

647
00:31:46,434 --> 00:31:48,118
Have you met Grubbs, the bartender?

648
00:31:48,201 --> 00:31:50,218
He's kind of hot, in a...

649
00:31:50,301 --> 00:31:52,918
dirty, "I'm gonna hate myself
in the morning" sort of way.

650
00:31:53,001 --> 00:31:55,067
Ciao.

651
00:31:57,001 --> 00:31:58,918
Hi. Oh, thank you.

652
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,984
You know, I could get
used to being the one

653
00:32:01,067 --> 00:32:02,351
watching from the stands.

654
00:32:02,434 --> 00:32:04,484
No, it's my job.
I'm not giving it up.

655
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:06,151
Oh. You were amazing, Hales.

656
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:07,851
Thank you.

657
00:32:07,934 --> 00:32:10,584
When I was up there, I couldn't
stop thinking about how lucky we are

658
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,385
and how we just got
everything we dreamed of...

659
00:32:12,468 --> 00:32:15,051
Jamie and how far we've come,

660
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:17,951
and it just feels like nothing
can get in the way of that anymore.

661
00:32:18,034 --> 00:32:20,318
Why do we say things like that?

662
00:32:20,401 --> 00:32:22,118
What?

663
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:25,201
Well, I didn't want to tell
you this before the show, but...

664
00:32:30,201 --> 00:32:34,700
he is the healthiest-looking
dying man I have ever seen.

665
00:32:35,934 --> 00:32:38,434
I guess evil does a body good.

666
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:48,484
It's everything I took
from you... plus interest.

667
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,617
Well.

668
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,784
Not that I have anything to say

669
00:32:53,867 --> 00:32:55,684
to your thieving ass,

670
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:59,218
but you took a lot
more than money, Rachel.

671
00:32:59,301 --> 00:33:01,784
And I'm trying to take
responsibility for that, Brooke.

672
00:33:01,867 --> 00:33:03,285
You should, too.

673
00:33:03,368 --> 00:33:06,484
I'm sorry. Is that hair
color seeping into your brain?

674
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:10,517
What in your twisted, little
head am I responsible for?

675
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,684
You left a envelope full
of money with a junkie.

676
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:14,550
Says the junkie.

677
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:16,417
True forgiveness is about

678
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,817
accepting our own fault in things.

679
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,934
You'd know that if
you watched the show.

680
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:25,151
Now, I have given you
an apology and a check,

681
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:27,218
and you've given me nothing.

682
00:33:27,301 --> 00:33:29,101
But that's okay. I forgive...

683
00:33:30,101 --> 00:33:32,734
Stay away from me, bitch.

684
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:45,617
Whiskey... straight up.

685
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,784
Hmm.

686
00:33:46,867 --> 00:33:48,001
I'd have guessed blood.

687
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:52,484
Interesting choice
for the poster boy

688
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:54,001
of redemption and clean living.

689
00:34:00,767 --> 00:34:04,251
I know I surprised you today.

690
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:05,734
I'm sorry about that.

691
00:34:07,334 --> 00:34:10,151
You're always sorry, Dan.

692
00:34:10,234 --> 00:34:12,918
So, why are you back?
What do you want?

693
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:14,234
A chance.

694
00:34:16,368 --> 00:34:18,401
It's not gonna happen, Dan.

695
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:20,784
And I'm kind of thinking

696
00:34:20,867 --> 00:34:23,600
you should cancel your
plane ride to ask Lucas, too.

697
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:29,584
You know, I'd hoped fixing
things between you and Renee

698
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,984
would help thaw the ice a bit.

699
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:33,951
So you did that for yourself.

700
00:34:34,034 --> 00:34:35,717
No.

701
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,301
I did it for you.

702
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:42,633
Well, I already said "thank you."

703
00:34:44,034 --> 00:34:45,385
You know...

704
00:34:45,468 --> 00:34:49,251
there's never gonna be a
golden ticket back into my life.

705
00:34:49,334 --> 00:34:51,450
I'll tolerate you for Jamie.

706
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:52,900
But you're dead to me.

707
00:34:54,533 --> 00:34:57,134
The moment Keith died, you died.

708
00:35:14,067 --> 00:35:15,884
It's like watching an antelope

709
00:35:15,967 --> 00:35:18,517
at the watering hole
in the Serengeti.

710
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,851
This antelope hasn't hooked up
at the watering hole in weeks.

711
00:35:21,934 --> 00:35:24,118
There's a nun that's
been hogging all my time.

712
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:27,018
Oh, excuse me. I guess I've
been messing up your game.

713
00:35:27,101 --> 00:35:31,633
Eh, it's okay.
The game was getting old.

714
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:37,751
I thank you for today.

715
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:40,018
I'm glad that you got
me out of the house.

716
00:35:40,101 --> 00:35:41,784
Those kids were good for me.

717
00:35:41,867 --> 00:35:43,084
Yeah.

718
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:45,651
I know, right?

719
00:35:45,734 --> 00:35:49,101
It's all about finding
magic in unexpected places.

720
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:51,567
Yeah.

721
00:35:53,267 --> 00:35:55,151
So, did you get that
call you were waiting on?

722
00:35:55,234 --> 00:35:57,118
Not yet.

723
00:35:57,201 --> 00:35:59,351
But, you know, I've done
a lot of deals like this.

724
00:35:59,434 --> 00:36:00,951
Silence is just one of their tools.

725
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:02,318
It'll work out.

726
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:03,584
I hope so.

727
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:04,984
Yeah.

728
00:36:05,067 --> 00:36:06,484
Well, I should get going.

729
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:08,884
I have to be up early and bring
coffee to this friend of mine.

730
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,267
He kind of depends on me.

731
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,984
I'll see you tomorrow.

732
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:15,633
Quinn.

733
00:36:18,201 --> 00:36:20,468
Who says tonight's over?

734
00:36:24,867 --> 00:36:27,151
I just thought you'd be home by now.

735
00:36:27,234 --> 00:36:29,817
Look, me too, but she's all alone.

736
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,417
So am I.

737
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,751
Brooke, you know I love you.

738
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:36,751
I just don't think I
should leave her yet.

739
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:39,051
She's...

740
00:36:39,134 --> 00:36:40,751
I'm worried about her.

741
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:43,184
Well, I'm worried about us.

742
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,067
But you do what you've got to do.

743
00:37:07,301 --> 00:37:10,951
I was stupid to think
he'd let me back in.

744
00:37:11,034 --> 00:37:12,517
Baby, let's go back to L.A.

745
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,167
Let's leave these small
people and this small town.

746
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:20,817
This small town's the
closest thing we have to home.

747
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,584
And I'm not running from it anymore.

748
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:23,784
Neither should you.

749
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,651
Who says I'm running?

750
00:37:25,734 --> 00:37:27,884
You are.

751
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:29,301
We both are.

752
00:37:31,101 --> 00:37:34,584
And I'm not leaving until
I get what I came for.

753
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:36,784
What's that, Dan?

754
00:37:36,867 --> 00:37:39,034
Redemption.

755
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:47,717
Come on. You totally can't see it?

756
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,051
Look closer.

757
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:51,184
I swear that there's
a face on the moon.

758
00:37:51,267 --> 00:37:52,884
Oh, yeah. Look at that. It...

759
00:37:52,967 --> 00:37:54,784
Wow. It's entirely
made of cheese, too.

760
00:37:54,867 --> 00:37:56,784
Oh, yeah, and you totally suck.

761
00:37:56,867 --> 00:37:59,517
And you totally crack me up.

762
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,301
And I... I haven't laughed
so hard in a long time.

763
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,600
You want to go for a swim?

764
00:38:14,201 --> 00:38:17,018
Says the man that knows
I'm afraid of the water.

765
00:38:17,101 --> 00:38:18,867
What if I'm afraid, too?

766
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,951
Okay, I'll play.

767
00:38:24,034 --> 00:38:25,967
What are you afraid of?

768
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,550
To move on.

769
00:38:29,633 --> 00:38:32,468
And to feel something
for someone now.

770
00:38:34,934 --> 00:38:36,734
But I'm tired of being afraid. I...

771
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,617
There are so many reasons

772
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,734
that I shouldn't have done that.

773
00:38:53,468 --> 00:38:55,500
But I've wanted to for so long.

774
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,334
Me too.

775
00:39:14,334 --> 00:39:16,101
You can do it, Alex.

776
00:39:17,934 --> 00:39:19,667
I know.

777
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,351
Wait.

778
00:39:26,434 --> 00:39:28,468
I don't understand.

779
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,951
I do.

780
00:39:36,034 --> 00:39:37,784
You've been lying all night.

781
00:39:37,867 --> 00:39:39,784
Nice performance, Alex.

782
00:39:39,867 --> 00:39:41,517
No, I wasn't lying. I swear.

783
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,684
Julian, please.

784
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:45,267
It was full.

785
00:40:01,034 --> 00:40:02,884
Why can't you be the girl

786
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:07,567
who gets the boy and
the baby, Brooke Davis?

787
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,784
Hey.

788
00:40:31,867 --> 00:40:34,450
You know that this thing with Dan...

789
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:36,118
It's gonna be okay, right?

790
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:38,184
He can't hurt us anymore.

791
00:40:38,267 --> 00:40:40,251
Yeah, I know.

792
00:40:40,334 --> 00:40:41,667
Good.

793
00:40:43,334 --> 00:40:46,717
So, how about a little
special encore performance

794
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,285
for my sexy-ass husband?

795
00:40:48,368 --> 00:40:49,951
Yeah?

796
00:40:50,034 --> 00:40:51,751
Big news in the nba...
The Charlotte Bobcats

797
00:40:51,834 --> 00:40:53,584
have opened up their checkbook
and capped themselves out,

798
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:57,118
acquiring Derek McDaniel in
a hush-hush deal late today.

799
00:40:57,201 --> 00:40:59,184
That's bad news for
local star Nathan Scott,

800
00:40:59,267 --> 00:41:02,301
who is going to have to find
a spot elsewhere, if at all.
