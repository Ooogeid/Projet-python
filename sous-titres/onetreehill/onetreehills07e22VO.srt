1
00:01:11,828 --> 00:01:12,828
Nathan!

2
00:01:18,575 --> 00:01:20,397
Help me!

3
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,001
Haley!

4
00:01:25,671 --> 00:01:27,418
You okay?
Oh, my God.

5
00:01:28,968 --> 00:01:30,964
Breathe, Haley. Just breathe.

6
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,201
I was just trying to feel something.

7
00:01:46,788 --> 00:01:49,243
Like... alive, I guess.

8
00:01:50,953 --> 00:01:53,630
And did that make you feel alive?

9
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:56,420
No.

10
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:01,771
But it made me want to.

11
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:12,767
Julian, I thought we agreed we
weren't gonna hang posters out here.

12
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,484
I didn't hang a...

13
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:36,291
What are you up to?

14
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:38,075
I love your back.

15
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:41,728
You know where we should go?

16
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:43,798
Julian's movie premiere.

17
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:46,595
Maybe we could talk Nathan
and Haley into going.

18
00:02:46,678 --> 00:02:48,810
Might be good for her to get away.

19
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:50,848
And then we...

20
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,464
could...

21
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:55,103
ski.

22
00:02:56,494 --> 00:02:58,559
Girls that can spell are sexy.

23
00:03:00,886 --> 00:03:03,874
Then we could stay
up all night and...

24
00:03:05,163 --> 00:03:06,170
F...

25
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,691
U...

26
00:03:08,774 --> 00:03:09,976
Are terrible.

27
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:14,294
I'm just insanely in love with you.

28
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,700
As promised.

29
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,880
I wish I could tell you
there was a magic cure, Haley.

30
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:30,310
But depression is a
singular struggle.

31
00:03:30,394 --> 00:03:32,713
Some people just wake up one day

32
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,932
and feel a little better
than the day before.

33
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,240
Hi, mama. How you feeling?

34
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:47,513
Come here.

35
00:03:50,748 --> 00:03:55,001
What was that you were saying the
other day about wanting to see snow?

36
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:58,304
Well, aunt Brooke says
it's snowy in Utah,

37
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:01,559
and that's where
Julian's movie is playing.

38
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:03,125
And everyone's going.

39
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:08,132
Everyone, huh?

40
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,215
Yeah.

41
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:12,935
Maybe you should try this on.

42
00:04:15,606 --> 00:04:18,776
Yeah, I don't... I don't want
your ears to get cold in the snow.

43
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,142
You mean we can go?

44
00:04:21,757 --> 00:04:23,356
Oh! I got to tell dad.

45
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:24,819
Jamie.

46
00:04:25,773 --> 00:04:26,773
Yeah?

47
00:04:28,104 --> 00:04:29,232
I love you.

48
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:30,615
I love you, too.

49
00:04:31,476 --> 00:04:33,273
Dad, we're going to Utah!

50
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:45,283
You think there's room
for all of us?

51
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:47,722
Oh, yeah. I think there's room.

52
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:50,862
There's trees in the
house and moose antlers.

53
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,894
There's 12 of us.

54
00:04:52,977 --> 00:04:55,796
Only six bedrooms and
a couple of couches.

55
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:00,230
Dibs.

56
00:05:06,257 --> 00:05:08,159
You had them lock the master, right?

57
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:09,676
Don't worry. We're good.

58
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,479
Hey, uh,
you need some help drinking that?

59
00:05:26,644 --> 00:05:29,931
Lauren told me what you said
about us being boys and all.

60
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:32,500
I know we never really
talked about it, but...

61
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,319
It meant a lot to me.

62
00:05:34,402 --> 00:05:37,120
Thanks, but...
I just want to get back

63
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:39,074
to the way we used to be, you know?

64
00:05:39,157 --> 00:05:40,692
Yeah, I feel that.

65
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,976
Anyway,
this trip 'bout to be insane.

66
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:47,672
Plus, I get to rock my
new coat I just got in L.A.

67
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,920
Check this out.

68
00:05:57,181 --> 00:05:59,176
Dude. No.

69
00:06:02,873 --> 00:06:04,893
Hey, everyone! Dad! Come on!

70
00:06:06,195 --> 00:06:08,318
Doesn't anyone want to play?

71
00:06:20,064 --> 00:06:22,225
Ugh. I think I got some in my mouth.

72
00:06:22,308 --> 00:06:25,023
As long as it's not yellow,
I think you'll be fine.

73
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:28,205
Hey, dad, can we build a snow fort?

74
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:30,599
- I can build you a snow fort, buddy.
- Okay, cool.

75
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,963
Wait... how do we know you, again?

76
00:06:33,378 --> 00:06:34,593
I'm Chase.

77
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:36,730
The bartender at Tric?

78
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,218
Whatever. You're no Grubbs.

79
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,394
Retreat! Retreat!

80
00:07:53,323 --> 00:07:55,443
Oh, you guys are so dead!

81
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,529
Are you excited
about tomorrow night?

82
00:09:20,962 --> 00:09:21,962
Yeah.

83
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:25,834
My dad says three things have
to happen at this festival.

84
00:09:26,086 --> 00:09:28,154
The audience has to love the movie,

85
00:09:28,237 --> 00:09:31,596
we have to sell it, and I
have to decide what's next.

86
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:36,927
Well, not to sound naive, but
maybe you should just enjoy it.

87
00:09:37,947 --> 00:09:39,955
Yeah. I'd just enjoy it.

88
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,583
It's a good life.

89
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,141
Alex DuprÃ©.?

90
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:52,406
Right. Maybe two rehabs ago.

91
00:09:52,778 --> 00:09:54,340
Back of the line.

92
00:09:56,382 --> 00:09:57,700
Hey, hold up.

93
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,351
I like that coat, man.

94
00:09:59,434 --> 00:10:01,325
Oh, that's what
I'm talking about, baby.

95
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:03,972
Him, him, and
the ladies, they with me.

96
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:05,173
Thanks.

97
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:06,256
Not him.

98
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,709
Back of the line. Let's go.

99
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:10,127
Nah, I'm just kidding.
He with us, too.

100
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:12,411
All right. Come on, man. Hurry up.

101
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,374
People love the coat, baby!

102
00:10:15,457 --> 00:10:16,457
Oh. Dang.

103
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,992
- Stop worrying about her.
- What?

104
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:39,901
You're worrying about Haley.

105
00:10:39,984 --> 00:10:42,766
All right, look... she's
with Nate. She's fine.

106
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:45,269
Besides, I got you a few things.

107
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:46,918
White wine.

108
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:48,140
Thank you.

109
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,316
And a kiss, because my
baby looks amazing tonight.

110
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:57,023
And, last but not least,
a spare key to the house,

111
00:10:57,432 --> 00:10:59,295
because you lose things.

112
00:10:59,378 --> 00:11:01,159
I do not lose things.

113
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,005
Look, just put it outside somewhere.

114
00:11:04,088 --> 00:11:06,025
You know what? I'm
gonna keep my white wine.

115
00:11:06,108 --> 00:11:08,208
And you can have your kiss back.

116
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,658
But I don't need the key,
because I don't lose things.

117
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,400
- Who want to dance?
- I do.

118
00:11:18,265 --> 00:11:20,601
Where's your, uh,
"boyfriend" tonight?

119
00:11:20,684 --> 00:11:21,969
I'm looking at him.

120
00:11:22,742 --> 00:11:24,771
You're the devil, aren't you?

121
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,361
Why?

122
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:30,393
Because you know I
just broke up with Mia.

123
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,570
So?

124
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:37,301
So I'm taking off, devil Dupré.

125
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:40,375
And I'm locking my door.

126
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:44,513
She was sexy until
she started dancing.

127
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:50,179
Lose the beat?

128
00:12:02,445 --> 00:12:03,847
How you doing?

129
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:07,243
I gave this flower to Miranda.

130
00:12:08,581 --> 00:12:11,081
It's just another
thing she left behind.

131
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,227
Doesn't mean she doesn't miss you.

132
00:12:15,171 --> 00:12:20,155
There's just so much that I wish I
would have said the last time I saw her.

133
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,036
What did you say?

134
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:24,909
Nothing.

135
00:12:26,855 --> 00:12:28,340
Then say it in here.

136
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:30,944
You know, write one more great song.

137
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:32,629
Let's finish this record.

138
00:12:33,105 --> 00:12:34,195
Then what?

139
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:36,716
Well...

140
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:38,550
if I was you...

141
00:12:39,102 --> 00:12:40,869
I'd start my tour in London.

142
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:44,216
And I'd water that orchid.

143
00:12:47,385 --> 00:12:48,385
Grubbs.

144
00:12:49,926 --> 00:12:51,698
I know it feels bad now...

145
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:55,095
but it's gonna get better.

146
00:12:55,868 --> 00:12:57,277
One more song.

147
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,886
It was a good night tonight.

148
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,523
And now it's a better night.

149
00:13:24,606 --> 00:13:27,048
I think you were right
about me losing stuff.

150
00:13:28,157 --> 00:13:31,045
I seem to have, uh, lost my clothes.

151
00:13:35,575 --> 00:13:36,825
Where you going?

152
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,814
Now I've lost my way to the bed.

153
00:13:41,897 --> 00:13:44,683
Guess I'll just have
to sleep somewhere else.

154
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,226
No.

155
00:14:00,945 --> 00:14:02,160
She's good.

156
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,731
She's good.

157
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:07,674
I made a place for you on the floor.

158
00:14:07,757 --> 00:14:10,151
Right. Shut up and scoot over.

159
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:17,108
I thought maybe you'd
end up in Chase's room.

160
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,448
I tried. He locked the door.

161
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,679
I know. I tried, too.

162
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,416
Do you ever think about coming out?

163
00:14:33,898 --> 00:14:35,919
My dad's a football coach, Alex.

164
00:14:36,737 --> 00:14:40,338
And my mom... my mom's
a football coach's wife.

165
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:43,593
She loves this version of me...

166
00:14:43,838 --> 00:14:45,138
the leading man.

167
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:48,185
So...

168
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,322
Well...

169
00:14:52,135 --> 00:14:54,020
For what it's worth, if I was a mom,

170
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:56,122
I don't think there
could be any words

171
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:59,231
that would ever make
me stop loving my child.

172
00:15:00,151 --> 00:15:01,778
Unless, of course, those words were

173
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:04,033
"mom and dad,
I secretly made a sex tape."

174
00:15:06,288 --> 00:15:08,438
It's amazing how much I hate you.

175
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:12,995
Jamie had a blast today.

176
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:15,872
The guys built him a snow fort.

177
00:15:21,478 --> 00:15:23,524
I know that you came
here just for him.

178
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:26,565
I do.

179
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,342
And I love you for that, Haley.

180
00:15:34,844 --> 00:15:38,029
Please don't think that
I take that for granted.

181
00:15:40,658 --> 00:15:42,307
I'm so grateful for...

182
00:15:42,602 --> 00:15:44,569
who you've been through all of this.

183
00:15:44,654 --> 00:15:46,405
And how you've been.

184
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:48,540
There's no other way for me to be.

185
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:52,048
You've saved me so many times.

186
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:58,769
I worry that I've
been selfish with you.

187
00:16:00,768 --> 00:16:04,252
That I've taken advantage
of your strength

188
00:16:04,335 --> 00:16:06,355
and your selflessness...

189
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:10,664
And that I've...
I've broken you somehow.

190
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:11,747
No, no.

191
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:15,934
You haven't. You didn't.

192
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:20,422
I just have a weight in my heart
now that I didn't have before.

193
00:16:24,686 --> 00:16:26,636
It was lighter today, though.

194
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,033
It's beautiful, isn't it?

195
00:16:46,524 --> 00:16:47,528
Yeah.

196
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:49,974
It makes me think of mom.

197
00:16:50,616 --> 00:16:52,316
She would have liked it.

198
00:16:52,823 --> 00:16:53,823
Yeah.

199
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:57,235
Well, you know mom believed
in reincarnation, right?

200
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,815
So I think we'll see her again.

201
00:17:01,005 --> 00:17:03,076
What do you think she'll be?

202
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:07,234
Different.

203
00:17:09,537 --> 00:17:11,090
I think she'll be an owl.

204
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:14,574
A beautiful, majestic,
sarcastic owl.

205
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:19,513
I just wish she could be here again.

206
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,326
I can't believe you actually
locked your door last night.

207
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:50,646
I can't believe you
actually tried to get in.

208
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:52,546
Would that be so bad?

209
00:17:54,015 --> 00:17:58,053
Says the girl who just wants
someone normal and reliable.

210
00:17:58,136 --> 00:17:59,770
You said that at Tric.

211
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:01,138
You were listening.

212
00:18:01,223 --> 00:18:03,849
Of course I was listening.
I'm a bartender... manager.

213
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:05,411
And almost pilot.

214
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:07,812
I was listening, too.

215
00:18:10,565 --> 00:18:13,984
I'd crush out on you,
and then you'd be gone.

216
00:18:27,115 --> 00:18:29,717
Hi, mama. Come on in. You like it?

217
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,801
Oh, I do like it.

218
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:36,789
This is great, buddy!

219
00:18:37,261 --> 00:18:38,561
Oh, my goodness.

220
00:18:43,732 --> 00:18:45,100
What do you like about it?

221
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:48,116
I like that it's quiet.

222
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:50,305
It feels kind of safe in here.

223
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,579
That's smart, kiddo.

224
00:18:53,825 --> 00:18:56,494
So, listen... I was thinking
about going into town

225
00:18:56,578 --> 00:18:58,247
and buying a dress for tonight.

226
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,698
What do you think?

227
00:18:59,781 --> 00:19:02,166
You want to, uh, get a
suit for Julian's premiere?

228
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:04,642
- Can I pick it out myself?
- Yes.

229
00:19:10,008 --> 00:19:12,111
It's a really cool fort, Jame.

230
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,427
Yeah.

231
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:21,428
Clay?

232
00:19:29,277 --> 00:19:30,813
"No cellphone coverage.

233
00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:32,865
Went to lunch at the diner on main.

234
00:19:32,948 --> 00:19:36,310
Come by, unless you've
lost your appetite."

235
00:19:39,604 --> 00:19:40,621
Hot tub.

236
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:49,432
Oh... beers.

237
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Key.

238
00:20:48,532 --> 00:20:49,685
Why? Uh...

239
00:20:49,896 --> 00:20:51,200
What happened?

240
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,283
Key.

241
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,460
She loses things.

242
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,848
Mama, I found my suit.

243
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:18,740
Well, that is quite
a suit of clothes.

244
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,328
I really like it. Can I get it?

245
00:21:22,595 --> 00:21:24,145
Yes. Absolutely.

246
00:21:25,628 --> 00:21:27,703
- And you know what?
- What?

247
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:32,468
Your grandma would have
loved you in this suit.

248
00:21:32,551 --> 00:21:34,337
Just no bullfighting, okay?

249
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,822
No problem.
Bullfighting is caca del toro.

250
00:21:36,905 --> 00:21:38,000
Okay.

251
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,351
Hey, mama.

252
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:43,231
You're pretty when you smile.
I missed it.

253
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,421
Thanks buddy.

254
00:21:52,054 --> 00:21:53,890
Are you ready?

255
00:21:53,973 --> 00:21:55,940
My whole life, my hair's
been out to get me,

256
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:58,478
like it resents my forehead
for taking up too much room.

257
00:21:58,561 --> 00:22:00,129
Stop. You look nice.

258
00:22:00,212 --> 00:22:02,231
Maybe I should wear a hat.

259
00:22:02,314 --> 00:22:05,650
Like a beret. Or a fez.

260
00:22:06,752 --> 00:22:09,205
The movie is great.

261
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:11,456
And you are great.

262
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,410
And you look so handsome

263
00:22:14,493 --> 00:22:17,213
that we need to get
out of this bedroom,

264
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:19,330
or you're gonna miss your premiere.

265
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,752
What would I do without you,
Brooke Davis?

266
00:22:22,835 --> 00:22:25,837
Well, for starters,
you'd wear a fez.

267
00:22:25,921 --> 00:22:27,824
Not okay.

268
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:29,592
Come on.

269
00:22:29,675 --> 00:22:31,959
Your dad and your
destiny are waiting.

270
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,075
Thank you.

271
00:22:46,447 --> 00:22:47,447
Welcome.

272
00:22:50,384 --> 00:22:52,504
When my son Julian called me

273
00:22:53,397 --> 00:22:56,726
and asked me if I wanted
to make a movie with him,

274
00:22:58,114 --> 00:23:01,942
I thought it might be a
nice chance to reconnect.

275
00:23:03,492 --> 00:23:06,763
But that was that was
wishful thinking on my part,

276
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:11,141
because I was gone so often
while he was, uh, growing up

277
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:14,334
that we never really
connected in the first place.

278
00:23:16,366 --> 00:23:17,953
And that's a shame.

279
00:23:20,676 --> 00:23:24,195
Whenever I finish a movie,
I... I have this expression...

280
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,229
"let's kick it out of the nest...

281
00:23:26,312 --> 00:23:27,862
and see if it flies."

282
00:23:29,118 --> 00:23:31,668
Well, son,
we kicked you out of the nest.

283
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:36,395
And it has been a
pleasure watching you soar.

284
00:23:38,862 --> 00:23:40,295
I hope you all agree.

285
00:23:45,668 --> 00:23:47,420
I'll see you in a bit.

286
00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:02,015
Julian. It's starting.

287
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:05,386
Yeah, I know. I think I'm
just gonna wait till it's over.

288
00:24:08,057 --> 00:24:10,608
Those were some nice things
your father said about you.

289
00:24:10,922 --> 00:24:11,922
Yeah.

290
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,664
You sure you don't want
to come back inside?

291
00:24:14,747 --> 00:24:17,700
Yeah, but you should go
watch it with an audience.

292
00:24:17,783 --> 00:24:20,835
I want you to see how good you
are as an actor and a writer.

293
00:24:22,338 --> 00:24:24,173
I was in good hands.

294
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:26,709
And everything's gonna be okay.

295
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:27,959
You know why?

296
00:24:28,043 --> 00:24:30,712
Because it already is.

297
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,934
Opened with a sex scene.
Nice work, Polanski.

298
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:38,019
Good luck explaining
that one to the kid.

299
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,274
You're not watching it either, huh?

300
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,360
Nope.

301
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:46,144
Were you grossed out, too?

302
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,431
Come on. We should go get a drink.

303
00:24:53,682 --> 00:24:55,082
I don't get it.

304
00:24:55,165 --> 00:24:59,258
You made a movie with
no animation, no stunts,

305
00:24:59,341 --> 00:25:01,541
no cars that transform into stuff,

306
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,651
no aliens, and no rabbits.

307
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,006
Yes, I did.

308
00:25:07,115 --> 00:25:08,755
What the heck else is there?

309
00:25:08,838 --> 00:25:09,856
Romance?

310
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:13,136
I don't think anyone
wants to see that.

311
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:18,048
I'm not sure anyone
wants to buy it, either.

312
00:25:19,308 --> 00:25:20,308
Here.

313
00:25:20,612 --> 00:25:22,214
It helped my mom.

314
00:25:22,297 --> 00:25:24,633
It's good luck.
You're gonna need it.

315
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,820
What do you know? You're 6,
and you're drinking at a bar.

316
00:25:30,939 --> 00:25:31,939
Seven.

317
00:25:33,442 --> 00:25:34,443
Nice.

318
00:25:34,526 --> 00:25:36,382
Nice work, el borracho.

319
00:25:39,296 --> 00:25:41,626
I'll tell you
something I am sure of.

320
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:43,059
We're all afraid.

321
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:47,452
Some of us find ways to hide
that fear, and some of us don't.

322
00:25:48,307 --> 00:25:50,375
But we've all got "it," you know?

323
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:52,244
And it's always there.

324
00:25:52,327 --> 00:25:54,463
And what's your "it," Elise?

325
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:55,914
What are you afraid of?

326
00:25:55,997 --> 00:26:00,553
I'm not afraid of anything.
I have you.

327
00:26:00,636 --> 00:26:02,770
You were good in that scene.

328
00:26:04,973 --> 00:26:07,025
I'm tired of being afraid.

329
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:20,939
It's still packed in there,
so at least nobody left.

330
00:26:21,022 --> 00:26:22,124
That's good, right?

331
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:23,659
What's happening on-screen?

332
00:26:23,742 --> 00:26:25,242
Hold on. I'll check.

333
00:26:33,836 --> 00:26:35,004
They're kissing.

334
00:26:35,087 --> 00:26:36,639
They've been doing a lot of that.

335
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:39,434
Seriously, you could have
used a robot or something.

336
00:26:39,868 --> 00:26:41,516
I think it's almost over.

337
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:43,362
It is.

338
00:26:43,445 --> 00:26:44,814
Right about...

339
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:45,897
Now.

340
00:26:47,266 --> 00:26:48,733
They're clapping!

341
00:26:57,076 --> 00:26:58,960
They liked it! Come on!

342
00:27:27,162 --> 00:27:28,259
Good news.

343
00:27:28,342 --> 00:27:30,528
The screening went great,
and we have buyers interested.

344
00:27:30,611 --> 00:27:32,403
The best of the bunch
are on their way down.

345
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:33,519
I got you a beer.

346
00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:36,171
Now, look... no matter
what their initial offer is,

347
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,948
I think we can get
them up to $4 million.

348
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,221
That sounds great.

349
00:27:39,304 --> 00:27:41,284
Just let me do the talking,
all right?

350
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,813
I won't say a word.

351
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,207
$2.5 million.

352
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,290
Deal!

353
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:53,410
Three.

354
00:27:53,698 --> 00:27:55,372
And a haircut for the kid.

355
00:27:56,491 --> 00:27:57,658
Deal.

356
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:04,482
Josh, this movie firmly
establishes you as a leading man.

357
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:06,350
You and Alex have amazing chemistry.

358
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,286
Is it because you're
together in real life?

359
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:10,587
Well...

360
00:28:11,572 --> 00:28:15,377
actually, there's something
everyone should know.

361
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,760
We're not together.

362
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,165
The thing is...

363
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:31,442
I... I'm just excited about how many hot
single women are gonna love this movie.

364
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,129
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

365
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,202
Nice!

366
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:26,053
Is this the V.I.P. snow fort?

367
00:29:26,136 --> 00:29:27,804
You don't have to check on me.
I'm fine.

368
00:29:27,888 --> 00:29:28,889
I'm not.

369
00:29:28,972 --> 00:29:30,799
I needed fresh ice...

370
00:29:31,388 --> 00:29:32,863
For my cocktail.

371
00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:43,139
Jump! Jump! Jump!

372
00:29:47,108 --> 00:29:48,108
What's up?

373
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,173
Damn, it's cold.

374
00:29:51,805 --> 00:29:53,355
Anybody seen my coat?

375
00:30:39,866 --> 00:30:41,254
Bear!

376
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,626
Do you think it's hibernating?

377
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:48,412
Nah. I think it's just passed out.

378
00:30:48,495 --> 00:30:51,081
Okay, here's what you're gonna do.

379
00:30:51,164 --> 00:30:54,101
Take this ski pole
and jab it real hard.

380
00:30:54,184 --> 00:30:55,852
I don't want to hurt it.

381
00:30:55,936 --> 00:30:57,687
It's too dumb to get hurt.

382
00:30:57,771 --> 00:30:59,190
Trust me. Go ahead.

383
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:02,727
Ow! Son of a...

384
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:03,810
It talks!

385
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,599
Aw, man.

386
00:31:21,363 --> 00:31:22,498
You leaving?

387
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,299
Yeah. Thought I'd fly to Denver.

388
00:31:26,037 --> 00:31:27,553
What's in Denver?

389
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:28,754
My parents.

390
00:31:30,276 --> 00:31:31,589
We need to talk.

391
00:31:32,904 --> 00:31:34,892
I think that's a really good idea.

392
00:31:36,556 --> 00:31:37,647
I hope so.

393
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:40,558
Anyway...

394
00:31:41,453 --> 00:31:42,858
I'll see you, Dupré.

395
00:31:44,453 --> 00:31:45,803
It's "Whitehead."

396
00:31:47,768 --> 00:31:49,323
Alice Whitehead.

397
00:31:50,496 --> 00:31:52,026
Alice Whitehead?

398
00:31:53,222 --> 00:31:54,745
That's a horrible name.

399
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:56,111
Shut up.

400
00:31:57,308 --> 00:32:00,183
Anyway,
I guess we all have our secrets.

401
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:05,721
Believe it or not, I'm
really gonna miss you.

402
00:32:15,445 --> 00:32:17,122
I'm gonna miss you, too...

403
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,269
Alice.

404
00:33:42,636 --> 00:33:44,305
It's pretty magical, isn't it?

405
00:33:44,752 --> 00:33:46,256
It's so beautiful.

406
00:33:46,772 --> 00:33:48,743
This whole trip has been perfect.

407
00:33:49,004 --> 00:33:51,269
Well, I have to admit,
I had a little help.

408
00:33:51,354 --> 00:33:54,072
Last night at the bar, Jamie
gave me a gold star for luck.

409
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,642
You want to see it?

410
00:33:55,725 --> 00:33:56,942
Yeah.

411
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:01,998
Oh, wait... that's not it.

412
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,282
That's the engagement
ring I got for you.

413
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:05,867
Where did I put that thing?

414
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,546
Everyone says that
the next thing I do,

415
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:20,016
the next choice I make
is going to define me...

416
00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:22,263
my career... my life.

417
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:24,770
Well...

418
00:34:25,078 --> 00:34:27,919
The next thing I want to
do is ask you to be my wife

419
00:34:28,157 --> 00:34:30,287
and tell you how much I love you

420
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:33,052
and how nothing else matters.

421
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,732
When I look into your eyes, Brooke,

422
00:34:37,364 --> 00:34:39,488
I see the rest of my life.

423
00:34:40,021 --> 00:34:41,620
And I see it with you.

424
00:34:51,084 --> 00:34:52,720
Marry me, Brooke Davis.

425
00:34:54,555 --> 00:34:55,681
Yes. Okay.

426
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:57,466
I want to so much.

427
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:01,890
I was hoping you
were gonna say that.

428
00:35:15,283 --> 00:35:16,411
Come here.

429
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,409
Oh, mom, you're squishing me.

430
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,410
Oh, I'm sorry for squishing you.

431
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,395
Let's go sledding. Do you want to?

432
00:35:23,478 --> 00:35:25,168
Totally. I'll go tell everyone.

433
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:27,949
- Dad, we're going sledding!
- All right.

434
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:33,630
You okay?

435
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,419
No. But... 

436
00:35:36,846 --> 00:35:38,005
I will be.

437
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,898
What do you think, Calvin?
It's a long way down.

438
00:36:18,587 --> 00:36:21,364
Piece of cake, Hobbes.
Let's do this.

439
00:37:30,094 --> 00:37:32,139
It sure is a long way up, mama.

440
00:37:33,664 --> 00:37:35,214
No, it's just a hill.

441
00:37:36,267 --> 00:37:37,284
Come on.

442
00:37:37,953 --> 00:37:39,840
We'll climb it together.

443
00:37:59,968 --> 00:38:02,121
You know, I don't think
you're actually supposed to

444
00:38:02,204 --> 00:38:03,723
replace stuff in your hotel room.

445
00:38:03,806 --> 00:38:06,511
Oh, whatever. I'll be
out of here soon, anyway.

446
00:38:06,594 --> 00:38:08,561
Think I might get a
place of my own...

447
00:38:08,644 --> 00:38:10,860
maybe stick around a while.

448
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:14,560
Sounds kind of normal and stable.

449
00:38:15,551 --> 00:38:16,551
There.

450
00:38:18,989 --> 00:38:20,005
Perfect.

451
00:38:20,588 --> 00:38:21,588
Well...

452
00:38:21,824 --> 00:38:22,824
almost.

453
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:25,831
Say you'll go out with
me, and then it will be.

454
00:38:30,566 --> 00:38:31,566
Okay.

455
00:38:31,967 --> 00:38:32,967
Yes.

456
00:38:55,174 --> 00:38:57,542
You know what I like
best about the movie?

457
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,849
What's that?

458
00:39:01,864 --> 00:39:06,501
You get the sense that they're
all gonna live happily ever after.

459
00:39:08,295 --> 00:39:09,386
They are.

460
00:39:27,306 --> 00:39:28,356
You okay?

461
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:33,411
These aren't sad tears.
They're happy tears.

462
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:36,416
All right, well,
how about from now on,

463
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,817
we do smiles for happy instead?

464
00:39:40,402 --> 00:39:41,586
What is it?

465
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,471
I'm pregnant.

466
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,661
I think it's gonna be a girl.

467
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:54,416
Oh, my...

468
00:40:00,122 --> 00:40:01,422
Nice work, daddy.

469
00:40:14,504 --> 00:40:17,404
You're falling asleep.
Why don't you go to bed?

470
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,435
I like it here.

471
00:40:20,542 --> 00:40:22,376
Yeah, I like it here, too.

472
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,232
But you sleep like a rock,
and you're too long to carry.

473
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:27,782
You're mean.

474
00:40:29,418 --> 00:40:33,171
You say I'm too long,
and you say I lose things.

475
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:34,931
But I also love you.

476
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:38,227
And the truth is that without you,

477
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,163
I'd be the one who's lost.

478
00:40:41,278 --> 00:40:42,357
Nice save.

479
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,240
I love you.

480
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:50,637
I love you, too.
