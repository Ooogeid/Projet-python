Good morning.

35
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,800
What's your day like?

36
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,900
Mostly just playing.

37
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,000
My day's not bad either.

38
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,400
I'm just gonna finish
grading these papers

39
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,300
And then go over to see peyton
for a little bit,

40
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,600
And then you and i have
to interview the n-A-N-N-I-E-S.

41
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,700
I hate it when you spell.

42
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Don't say, "hate."

43
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,700
Sorry.
I just think it's d-U-M.

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,200
Wow.

45
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Add a "b" to the end of that,
or you will be, too.

46
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,400
Jamie, what do you think about
going to practice with me today?

47
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,700
Can i?

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,400
I don't know.
It's a big step.

49
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,600
What do you think, mom?

50
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,400
Please be careful.

51
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,300
Sweet!
I'll go get my jersey.

52
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,500
Thanks, mama.
I l-O-V-E you!

53
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,300
I l-O-V-E you, too,
smarty-Pants.

54
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,600
Kid's got your brains.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,700
I just now figured out that
you were spelling "nannies."
Whatever.

56
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,300
They're getting here at 5:00,
by the way.
Okay.

57
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,700
And if you run into quentin
at practice,

58
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Will you t@al himhe's d
with his chapter reports
on "les mis"?

59
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,700
That's good.

60
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,400
Now if only he could figure out
his jump shot.

61
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,400
I'll see ya.
Bye, baby.

62
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,600
That desk
looks good on you, coach.

63
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,600
Welcome back, coach scott.

64
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
So, how my boy doing?

65
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,200
Boy's good.

66
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,500
Sorry i was out of touch
for so long.

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,400
Hey, you got to do
what you got to do, right?

68
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,200
I just wish i was able
to help you somehow.

69
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,500
You did. You ran the team
for the last month.

70
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,400
How they doing?

71
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,500
You know.
You win some.
You lose some.

72
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,400
And how many "some"
did you lose?

73
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,400
You lost eight games?

74
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,200
Yeah, but we won four.

75
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,100
Well,
three plus the first one,
but you was here
for that one.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,900
Look, i know this is
not what you was hoping for.

77
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,400
And i'm taking
all the blame for this.

78
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,900
But i'm gonna keep it real
with you.

79
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,900
"Q" sucks,
and it's all his fault.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I mean, he ain't hit a shot
since you left.

81
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,400
Because they're doubling him.

82
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,000
No.
His hand is messed up.

83
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,100
I mean,
we ice it constantly,but...

84
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,500
It just ain't been right
since he punched
that knucklehead over at tric.

85
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,000
What's "q" say?

86
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,600
He said
he had it checked out.

87
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,400
All right.
I'll talk to him.

88
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,500
See, that's the thing.

89
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,600
He asked me not to say
nothing to you about this.

90
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,500
He think the injury
gonna cost him a scholarship.

91
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,700
I'll tell you what's gonna
cost him a scholarship --
Playing injured
and going 4-8.

92
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,000
Yeah.

93
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
Let's get him in here.

94
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,600
Uncle lucas!

95
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,500
Hey!
There's the man!

96
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,300
I missed you, boy.

97
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,500
Daddy said
you were on a ship.

98
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,600
Did you see any pirates?

99
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,200
Yeah, i saw
a coup pirate ships,

100
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,800
But they didn't want
any part of me.

101
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,100
You want to show me
your jump shot?

102
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,400
All right.

103
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Welcome back, luke.

104
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,900
You good?

105
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,800
I'm working on it.

106
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, my god.

107
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,800
Oh my god

108
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,600
The macy's presentation!
I forgot!

109
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,300
I remembered.
It's all right here.
We just need
your design sketches.

110
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,500
Thank you.

111
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,300
You have really stepped up,

112
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,200
Especially with you-Know-Who
out of the picture.

113
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,900
But...

114
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,800
But what?
Am i in trouble?

115
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,100
No.

116
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,600
I was actually thinking
that

117
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,100
You are way too valuable
to just be
my assistant anymore,

118
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,800
So how would you feel

119
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,200
About a little raise
and a little promotion?

120
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,700
Oh, my gosh!
I don't knowhat to say.

121
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,700
What's my title gonna be?
Something cool, i hope.

122
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,300
We'll figure all that out,
but we have to get you
back to new york first.

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,300
Clothes over bro's.

124
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,500
This is she.

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,600
Oh.

126
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,400
Oh.

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,900
No.
Absolutely, i can.

128
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,700
I mean, i will.
Yes.

129
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,200
Thank you.

130
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,400
Milly:
brooke, i'm so happy, really, but...

131
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
I'm not sure
i can go back to new york.

132
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
That's okay.

133
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,700
Change of plans.
I'm gonna need you here.

134
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,600
Oh? Oh, good!

135
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,900
Why?
What's wrong?

136
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,400
I'm gonna be a mom

137
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,300
Brooke, i don't understand.
What do you mean youre gonna be a mom

138
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,900
That was the lady
from the agency.

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,100
The horrible woman who
said she wouldn't commend
you for adoption?

140
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,300
She said it's like a special
case, like a foster-Care thing.

141
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,300
Oh, my --

142
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,600
I have to get ready,
and i can't get this in my bag!

143
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,700
Okay. First of all,
you don't need this.

144
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,600
What do you need?
What can i help you with?

145
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,600
I don't know.

146
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,800
I've never had a baby.
I don't know what babies need.

147
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,700
I just --

148
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,000
I have to go, and
i cannot get this in my bag!

149
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,100
Once again,
you don't need this.

150
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,600
Now, just calm down.

151
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,500
Okay, where are my keys?

152
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
They're in your hand.

153
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,700
But i'm not sure
you should be driving.

154
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,700
Let me get you some water.
Millicent.

155
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,200
They're giving me a baby.

156
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,800
There's something missing
up on the wall.

157
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,500
There used to be another one.

158
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
What was it?

159
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,400
That was
your grandfather's jersey.

160
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,900
Grandpa dan?

161
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,800
Why'd they take it down?

162
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,400
Because of the bad things
he did.

163
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,300
People decided they didn't
want it up there anymore.

164
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,500
You do bad things sometimes,
daddy,

165
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,300
And yours is still up there.

166
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Not that bad.

167
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,200
Quentin:
ho, ho! There he is!

168
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,300

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,600

* i'm the dad

176
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
* and i'm not so bad

177
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,700
* i --

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,100
Mr. Fields.

179
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,100
Well, well.

180
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,400
The prodigal coach
returns...

181
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,000
And rockin' a tan to boot.
What's going on, coach?

182
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,000
You trying to get
all dark and sexy like me?

183
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,000
It's good
to see you, too.

184
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,600
Aw, man.
Come on, now, coach.

185
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,800
You know how we roll.

186
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,700
Even big game james know that.

187
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah, i know,
but this is how i roll.

188
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,300
Haley: hey, knock, knock.

189
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,300
Hey, foxy, what's up?

190
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,900
I like that outfit.
Oh, thank you.

191
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,600
There are perks to
having a very famous
designer as a roommate.

192
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,100
You get tons of free stuff.

193
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,300
Speaking of,
check out all these demos.

194
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,500
Wow. Looks like
things are picking up, huh?

195
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,300
Well, mostly
because your instincts
are pretty kick-Ass,
haley james scott.

196
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,100
Mia's album is killing it.

197
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,600
And are you ready for this?

198
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,200
She has sold...40,000 copies!

199
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,600
Wow! That's great!
That's really great! She --

200
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,900
She's really the kind of
girl that deserves it, you know?

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,600
I know.

202
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,800
Now i just need to find
another one.

203
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,300
Well, i already did --
You.

204
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,100
You deserve all the success
you're getting and more,

205
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,700
And i'm really proud of you.

206
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,100
Thanks, haley.

207
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,900
That really -- That means a lot
to me coming from you.

208
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,500
Actually, that was
just to butter you up,

209
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,400
'Cause i really need
to ask you for a favor.

210
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,900
You are a crack-Up.

211
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,100
What is it?
Anything.

212
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
So, you know how you're looking
for the next great artist

213
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,600
And you really trust
my instincts and everyth

214
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,700
Do you have a demo
for me?

215
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,700
I do.

216
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,000
Haley, that's awesome.
Who is it?

217
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,600
Haley james scott.

218
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,700
Yes.

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,600
Look, man, the doc says it's
gonna be a little swollen
from time to time.

220
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,900
Why y'all sweatin' it
so hard?

221
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,900
Because we're 4-8.

222
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,100
Maybe that's 'cause
of the coaching.

223
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,000
Easy.

224
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,600
Look, i'm just sayin. Man

225
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,900
One of them
disappeared for a month.

226
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,800
The other one
can't be trusted.

227
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,500
All right.

228
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,100
I want you to palm these.

229
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,900
Please.
[ Chuckles ]

230
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,300
There. You happy?

231
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Not quite.

232
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,600
Palm the balls...

233
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,200
And hold them there.

234
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,600
For how long?

235
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,900
I don't know.
30 seconds?

236
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,900
Shouldn'shbe a problem,
right?

237
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,900
I do this, and
all this nonsense goes away

238
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,400
30 seconds.

239
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
You see, the thing is, "q,"

240
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,600
It's not so much
that we're 4-8.

241
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
We're 4-8,
and you shooting like trash.

242
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,400
Yeah, that's 'cause
they doubling me, man.

243
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,300
Dole-Teams
never bothered you before.

244
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
See, you're one of the best
shooters i've ever seen, "q,"

245
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
When you're healthy.

246
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,300
The other ones -- Well,
they're right here in the gym.

247
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,900
Even me, uncle lucas?

248
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,200
Especially you, jamie.

249
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
See, you and quentin
are the best shooters we got.

250
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,000
When you're healthy.

251
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,300
Nothing like a second opinion.

252
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,200
And this time,
we'll come with you.

253
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,400
Go.

254
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I have news, boyfriend.

255
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,000
I might be getting a promotion
and staying in tree hill!

256
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,100
I might be getting a promotion
and leaving tree hill.

257
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,600
What?

258
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,500
Why?

259
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,600
Before i got the job
with the local stati

260
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,400
I sent audition tapes
everywhere.

261
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,100
There's a good station
in omaha,

262
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,400
And they saw
the ravens feature i did, and...

263
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,200
They offer me a job

264
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,200
In nebraska?

265
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,300
Yeah.

266
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,300
The nearest clothes over bro's
location to omaha is this one.

267
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,100
Yeah, i figured.

268
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,500
Well, is it really
that much better
than where you're at,
marvin?

269
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,200
I mean, like you said, you've
already done one feature here.

270
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,500
Maybe you'll get to do more.

271
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,300
Maybe, but it was really
just 'cause they were in a bind.

272
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,100
This w be
a full-Time on-Air position.

273
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,600
It's a small market,
but it's a great opportunity.

274
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,400
You should take it.
But --

275
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,200
If it gets yloser to your
dream, then you should take it.

276
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,500
I don't think
it's that easy.

277
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,600
Why not?

278
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Because you're part
of my dream, too.

279
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,600
Milly, i know we just started
out, but i love being with you,

280
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,600
And i...

281
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,200
I guess i was hoping
we had a future...together.

282
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,900
Was that too early?

283
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,100
Did i freak you out?

284
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,100
I freaked you out, didn't i?
No.
No, no, no, no.

285
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
There is no way those words
could have been too early --

286
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,800
Not coming from you.

287
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,700
Just promise me
that if you do take the job

288
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,000
That i can have your room,
because i'd really like
to find a place to stay

289
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,400
That's not pay-By-The-Day.

290
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,600
What?

291
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,700
I know it's really rough,
but i was thinking --

292
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,200
Yes.
But it's okay if you want --

293
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,700
Will you stop?
The answer is yes, okay?

294
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,500
I've been waiting
for the opportunity
to go out and buy
the next haley james record,

295
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,100
So of course
i want to record it.

296
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
It might
be kind of fun, huh?

297
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,800
Well, you did have a major-Label
debut that did pretty good,

298
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,500
So it is good business for me,
but, yes, it's gonna be a blast.

299
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,600
Yeah.

300
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,500
What do you say?

301
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,500
I say it's exactly what i need
right now.

302
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,700
Well, guess what.

303
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,400
Me

304
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,000
What?

305
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,800
I mean, you never know where the
next miracle's gonna come from.

306
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,000
It's brooke.

307
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,000
Oh.
Hey, brooke!

308
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,100
Hey, what's going on?

309
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Brooke: it's a miracle!

310
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,300
Uh, yeah.
We just said that.

311
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,800
What, did you bug my office?

312
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,300
They're giving me a baby!

313
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,300
Um...hold on. Wait. What?
What?

314
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,100
The lady from the agency
called this morning,

315
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,800
And they're sending me --

316
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,700
A purple monkey?

317
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,200
You're adopting
a purple monkey?

318
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,500
No, not adopting
and not nkey.

319
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,100
I'll explain it all later.
Peyton, how crazy is this?

320
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,700
No, brooke, honey,
that's awesome.

321
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,100
God, haley and i
thought we had big news.

322
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,400
Why?
What's your news?

323
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,900
We're gonna make
an album together.

324
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,700
Oh, whatever.
I'm getting a baby.

325
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,000
I have to go.
I'll call you later.

326
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,200
Excuse me.

327
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,400
Wow.
Today's kind of fun.

328
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,900
Listen, "q,"
i know it looks grim,

329
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,100
But, hey, we'll have that thing
off by the playoffs.

330
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,700
Playoffs?
Man, we 4-8.

331
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,500
Hey, we're gonna figure it out.
All right?

332
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,100
Just, uh, hang in there.

333
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,100
Yeah, i'd like to speak
to coach taylor,

334
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,300
If you don't mind...

335
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,500
Alone.

336
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,900
We'll be downstairs.

337
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,900
"Q," keep your head up,
all right?

338
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,900
Listen, kid --
Thanks for nothing, man.

339
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,000
I trusted you, all right?

340
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,200
I put my ass on the line for you
every single night, man.

341
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,500
Quentin, you needed this.

342
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,800
<i>I needed this?!</i>

343
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,400
I -- You know,
i needed a scholarship.

344
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,000
I needed you
to keep your mouth shut.
That's what i needed.

345
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,700
But you went
all uncle tom on me
as soon
as massa lucas got back, huh?

346
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,800
You know what?

347
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,000
When your wrist heals
erything's okay,

348
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,100
I'm gonna let you
take that back.

349
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,200
But for now...

350
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,500
Just consider yourself lucky.

351
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,500
Hi, grandpa.

352
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,200
Hi, jamie.

353
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,300
You boys want to jump me again,
now's your chance.

354
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,100
Hey.

355
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
We'rnot ha
ving this.

356
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,300
Not having what, son?

357
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,400
You following jamie around.

358
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,800
I've seen you, okay,
outside of the school.

359
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,000
I've seen you
driving past the house.

360
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,800
And now you just happen
to be at the hospital?
Nathan, stop.

361
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,100
I was in prison
for a long time, okay?

362
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,400
I was just getting
a checkup.

363
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,600
But the truth is,
i was hoping --

364
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,000
No, don't, dan.
Don't hope.

365
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,100
You hear me?

366
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,300
There's no hope for you.

367
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,100
I guess
i just don't understand.

368
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,300
Grandpa dan seems nice.

369
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,800
How come everyone's
always mad at him?

370
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,800
You love chester, don't you?

371
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,500
Well, what if grandpa dan
hurt chester

372
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,500
And took him away so
you could never see him again?

373
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,900
I guess i would be
really mad at him...

374
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,900
And sad, too.

375
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,800
Yeah.

376
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,100
Well, that's how we feel.

377
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,500
I just think that's kind
of an awful thing to say.

378
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,400
Yes, i'm mad.

379
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,600
<i>Oh, you don't think
i should be mad?</i>

380
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,200
I thought i was just gonna have
one baby in my life, but fine.

381
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,500
I have to go.

382
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,900
Holy cow!

383
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,700
Stupid owen.

384
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,700
A little baby talk,
and he totally freaks out.

385
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,300
Well, nothing like
foisting a baby
on a guy
you've almost kissed.

386
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,900
And a confirmed bachelor,
at that.

387
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,300
Whaty?
Whatever.

388
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,200
He's gonna come over later,

389
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,800
And we're gonna talk about it
or fight about it,

390
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,600
But it doesn't matter

391
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,900
Because baby and brooke
are gonna be fine.

392
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,500
Yeah, i think "baby and brooke"
needs a little explanation --

393
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,300
Like who, when, and how,
for starters.

394
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,200
Okay. So, the adoption agency
has this program

395
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,000
Where babies
from other countries
who need major surgeries and
stuff come over to the u.S.

396
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,900
And doctors donate their time
to fix them up

397
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And then they go home.

398
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,400
Oh.
That's great!

399
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,000
It's kind of a "whenever
they can squeeze you in"
sort of thing,

400
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,600
And the agency had a family at
was supposed to host the baby

401
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,600
Drop out, so they said
this could be a great trial run for me.

402
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,900
When does the baby show up?
Is it a boy
or a girl?

403
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,600
And are his parents
coming, too?

404
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,500
Okay. She's a girl,
and she gets here tomorrow.

405
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,900
Her parents
don't come with her,

406
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,400
And they didn't tell me
what's wrong with her.

407
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,400
They're just sort of
gonna hand her over,

408
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,600
And we go from there.

409
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,900
And check it out.

410
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,500
I got her...

411
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,400
A purple monkey
like the one i used to have.

412
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,700
That's so cute!

413
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,100
And did you get her
anything else?

414
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,700
Yeah, i got all this stuff.

415
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,400
I mean, like,
you know...food...

416
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
Or, i mean, a crib.
...and stuff.

417
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,900
I got a little sidetracked?

418
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,200
Okay. Why don't we go
to my house

419
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,700
And we'll go through some
of jamie's old things?

420
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,600
Really?
Yes.

421
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,900
Come on,
you purple monkey.

422
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,400
I'm so excited!
Me too.

423
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,800
Hey, what you doin'?

424
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,400
Looking for places to live.

425
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Well, stop, because
i've found you a place.

426
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,400
With me.

427
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,200
I passed on the omaha job.

428
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Marvin...

429
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,500
I feel like i'm good
at what i do, millicent,

430
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,200
And i'll just work hard and

431
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,300
Hope the station
gives me another shot.

432
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,500
Are you sure?

433
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,100
That i'm doing the right thing?
I don't know.

434
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,100
But about us?
Yeah. I'm sure.

435
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,500
I don't want to leave you,
millicent.

436
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,900
But you said you needed
a place to stay,

437
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,800
And i thought...
you should move in with me.

438
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,100
But...i can't.

439
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,300
I mean...

440
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,500
Look, i know it's soon, but
you'll save a fortune on rent,

441
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,200
And you'll get to see me
every day.

442
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,800
I mean, what do you say?

443
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'd like to,
but i just can't.

444
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,500
Sorry.

445
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,200
But i'm really glad
you're staying.

446
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,500
Haley, thank you.

447
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,400
This is great.

448
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,300
Sure.

449
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,800
Listen, have you given
any thought
to how difficult it's gonna be
to give this baby up

450
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,300
After the surgery? You know you got to fought for her brooke

451
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,900
I know.

452
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,500
But she needs help, right?

453
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,500
Yeah.

454
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,000
Nathan: hey.
What's going on?

455
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,200
Hi.

456
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,500
Hi, aunt brooke!

457
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,500
Hi, best boy ever!

458
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,500
I have a surprise for you.
What is it?

459
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,200
Hey.
I found the car seat.

460
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,100
Surprise.

461
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,300
It must have been good
to spend time with your mom
and lily and andy.

462
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,200
Yeah.
I think we all needed it.

463
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,600
Plus, the view wasn't too bad,
either.

464
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,800
Yeah,
i'm sure it was beautiful.

465
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,300
So, uh, you and haley
are gonna make a record, huh?

466
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,300
That's great.

467
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,400
Actually, i was meaning
to ask you --

468
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,300
I mean, it's totally cool
if you say no,

469
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,300
But, um, i was thinking,
to cut down on studicosts,

470
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,800
Maybe i would build
a small studio in the office.

471
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,900
But it's your space, so...

472
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,100
I think that's a great idea.

473
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,300
I mean, i'll ask my mom,
but, yeah, i think it's smart.

474
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,700
I don't blame you, peyton.

475
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,100
Luke...
at all for any of it.

476
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,500
I feel bad for you,
i feel bad for lindsey,

477
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,300
And i feel responsible
somehow.

478
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,000
And i really hope that doesn't
come off as arrogant, okay?

479
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,400
But i know this hurt you.

480
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,900
She's coming back, peyton.

481
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,200
She loves me.

482
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,800
And i love her.

483
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
It's gonna be okay.

484
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,300
I hope so.

485
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
It's open.

486
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,000
That kid's a lot hairier
than i thought he'd be.

487
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,200
Very funny.

488
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,000
And "he"
is gonna be a "she."

489
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,700
I guess you talked to owen.

490
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,500
Yep.

491
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,100
How you doin'?

492
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,900
Okay.
A little freak out but okay.

493
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,800
Is he with you?

494
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,700
No.

495
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,100
Weird.
He's coming over soon.

496
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,800
Actually, he's not.

497
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
That's kind of why i'm here.

498
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:05,900
Oh.

499
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,800
Okay.

500
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,000
You know, brooke,
owen's my friend,

501
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,600
And i know he's really into you,
but...

502
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,500
He's just kind of always been
about his independence, too,
you know?

503
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,300
I guess i didn't know.

504
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,800
He's just a little thrttd
with all the baby stuff.

505
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,100
Yeah,
he said that on the phone.

506
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,800
Look, did he send you over here
to talk to me?

507
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,300
Are we in junior high now?

508
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,800
He didn't send me over,

509
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,100
And he's not coming by either.

510
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,400
Then why did you?

511
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,100
Well...

512
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,800
I'm taking off.

513
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,100
I thought i'd say goodbye
and congratulations.

514
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,000
And maybe i want to see
your face one more time.

515
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,800
Probably why owen's
not coming by.

516
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,100
What is that
supposed to mean?

517
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,600
Well, he probably figures

518
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,500
If he looked in those eyes
one more time,

519
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,700
He'll cave
on the whole independence thing.

520
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,700
Anyways, call me
if you need anything...

521
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,600
Someone to talk to,
new carpets...

522
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,300
I don't know, a husband...

523
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
I'll see you around.

524
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
Hey, brooke?

525
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,600
Don't take the owen stuff
too personally.

526
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,500
I won't.

527
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,300
Yeah, you will.

528
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,600
I know how you are.

529
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,400
It's -- It's just a big deal.

530
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,800
It's kids.

531
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,900
I mean, i know it's just one,

532
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,500
But if you really want a family,
something that's like forever...

533
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,000
"Forever" scares a lot of us.

534
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,300
Yeah.

535
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,300
Hi.

536
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,700
Hi.
Can i talk to you?

537
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,000
Sure.
Come on in.

538
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,800
What's, uh --
What's wrong?

539
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,500
Um, maybe nothing...
i hope.

540
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,600
Okay, just have a seat.
What's up?

541
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,000
Well, i think i'll stand.

542
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,100
Actually, do you have
something to drink --

543
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,000
Some water or an apple martini with
a cherry, if you have it?

544
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,000
Okay, you're kind of
freaking me out.

545
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,200
The last time someone entered
the apartment like this,

546
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,400
It was skills, and he thought
he'd killed chester.

547
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,700
Jamie's bunny?

548
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,200
Yeah, but it turns out
he was just, like, a really
heavy sleeper, apparently.

549
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,600
Well, it's not that.

550
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,300
It's just i know
i sort of freaked you out

551
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,000
When you asked me to stay here,
and, well, there's a reason.

552
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,200
Great.
I knew it.

553
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,500
What?

554
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,600
I figured this was
just too good to be true.

555
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,600
There's just a reason
we can't sleep in the same bed.

556
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,700
Oh, no.
What?

557
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,200
This is like "the crying game,"
right?
Marvin!

558
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,600
Hairy back?
Marvin.

559
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,900
Well, it's either that
or you're completely repulsed
by me.

560
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,800
I'm a virgin.

561
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,800
Really?

562
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,900
Yes.

563
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,400
And considering your last gross
boss-Lady hookup,

564
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,700
You're clearly not, and
i am just not ready to --

565
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
How did i find you?

566
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,900
What?

567
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,800
Such a perfect girl
who's smart and sweet and...

568
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,000
So awesome.

569
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,500
Go on.

570
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,800
Milly, i would never
pressure you about sex.

571
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,200
I just --
I want to be with you.

572
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,100
But --

573
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,300
I mean, we could even get
two beds, if you want...

574
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,100
Although, if i catch you
sneaking into mine,

575
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
I'm telling skills.

576
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,900
I am so into you, and...

577
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,700
I want you here.

578
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,800
Will you say yes?

579
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,100
Okay. Yes.

580
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,400
If you think it can work.

581
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,700
It can.

582
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,900
It does.

583
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,700
So, i see you know cpr,

584
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,600
And you're also
a lifeguard.

585
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,600
Yes.

586
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,300
Have you ever kissed any
of the husbands you worked for?

587
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,800
Okay, uh...

588
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,900
No.

589
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,200
Well...

590
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
Sorry.

591
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:37,400
So, nathan...
haley tells me you like
to watch your nanny swim naked
in the pool?

592
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,500
I guess i deserved that.

593
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,700
Hey, brooke.

594
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
You okay?

595
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,000
I think i made a big mistake.

596
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,500
I think it's a little late
for that, isn't it?

597
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,100
If i wanted
a "little late for that,"

598
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,600
I would have called peyton.

599
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,400
You are supposed to say,
"no, you didn't.

600
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,000
You're gonna be fine."

601
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,200
No, you didn't.
You're gonna be fine.

602
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,700
It doesn't count now.

603
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,600
So, you got
a purple monkey, huh?

604
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,200
Just like you had.

605
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,600
You remember that?

606
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,200
Of course.

607
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,400
I do know some things about you,
brooke davis.

608
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,200
You're gonna be a great mom.

609
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,200
I'm not even gonna be a mom.

610
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,300
I just fix her up, and
then i have to send her back.

611
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,300
Well, if you didn't do it,
who would?

612
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,700
Owen thinks
i'm being selfish.

613
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,600
He thinks
i just want what i want.

614
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,800
Well, i'd say
it's the opposite.
Right?

615
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,300
I think it's great
that you're willing
to help  little girl
get the care that she needs

616
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,900
And get to the rest
of her life.

617
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,400
So do i.

618
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,600
But what if i do
something wrong, luke?

619
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,100
What if i hurt her?
What if i break her?

620
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,900
I mean, i rushed into this,
and i'm scared.

621
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,800
You know what?

622
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,500
When it comes to single moms,

623
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,200
I had a pretty special one.

624
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,100
And it's good
that you're a little scared.

625
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,800
But you're gonna do great.

626
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,600
Thanks.

627
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,900
Thanks for coming over.

628
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,600
You think she'll like the purple money?

629
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,600
I think that she's gonna love
the girl
who gives it to her.

630
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,400
Yeah.

631
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,400
Jamie's out cold.

632
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,800
I wish
i could sleep like that.
Yeah, tell me about it.

633
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,100
So, i'm sorry
you couldn't find a nanny
that you could trust
around me.

634
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Too soon

635
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,500
The truth is, i just want ja
all to myself right now.

636
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,500
But i also want my job
and i want my music

637
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,500
And i want alone time
with you.

638
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,400
Well, you should take a break
from that.

639
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,700
Let me go
through those things.

640
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,900
I'll try to find a person
that's really ugly
with a lot
of great references.

641
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,300
Actually, you can't,

642
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,100
Because i thought you might
want to get a workout in.

643
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,400
You know, our therapist said that

644
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,000
We should focus on
the things that we love, so...

645
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,400
I think she's right.

646
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,900
I'm probably really gonna suck,
you know.

647
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,300
You are gonna find out sometime right?

648
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
Thank you, hales...

649
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,100
For everything.

650
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,100
You're welcome.

651
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,900
Thank you back.

652
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,200
You lucky, man.

653
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,900
I was gonna break
that scoriatitle
and pull that old laundry
up off the wall.

654
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,400
Luck has nothing to doth it.

655
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,700
I'm just better than you.

656
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,400
How you holding up?

657
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,500
How you think?

658
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,300
If somebody would have told me
your old sorry ass
would be back playing
before mine,

659
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,000
I would have laughed
their ass out the gym.

660
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,800
What you trying to do --
Make some kind of comeback?

661
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,300
Trying to make
a free throw.

662
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,000
Let me show you
how that's done, old man.

663
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,800
Left-Handed...

664
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,900
You'rest fine,
"q"...

665
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,600
Even if you have to go
to a junior college first.

666
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,400
That's what i did.

667
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,100
Wow.
And look where it got you.

668
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,700
Let's see what you got.

669
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,800
Let's see what you got.
Come on, nate.

670
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,300
Oh, here we go.

671
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,600
Nathan scott.
Biggest raven of them all.

672
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,600
Look at you, huh?

673
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,900
Heard they clipped
your wings.

674
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
What you got, raven?

675
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,500
Nathan scott....

676
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,900
Just like i thought.
Hmm?

677
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,900
They must have put salt
on your tail, boy.

678
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,300
You ain't got no chance
of flying again.

679
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,100
Me, on the other hand...

680
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,300
...i can beat you
with my other hand,

681
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,800
And that ain't
even my shooting hand.

682
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,300
Some comeback,
mr. Jersey on the wall.

683
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,000
Sometimes you got
a big mouth, quentin.

684
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,300
Aw, nate.

685
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,500
Nate!

686
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,700
Come back, man!

687
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,700
Where you going?

688
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,700
Come back.
That's it?

689
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,300
That's a sorry-Ass comeback,
nate.

690
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,500
Nathan scott,
ladies and gentlemen.

691
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,400
Hello, son.

692
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,900
What are you doing here?

693
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,500
Just regjutting it all.

694
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,300
You too, huh?

695
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,300
Thinking
about playing again?

696
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,600
No! All right?!
I'm not thinking
about playing again!

697
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,700
I can't even make
a damn free throw.

698
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,000
At least
your legacy's safe, son.

699
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,300
Just do your best.

700
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,100
Unlike some of us, you have
nothing to be ashamed of.

701
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,200
Hey, man, you got a second?

702
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,800
Just don't come too close
right now, man.

703
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,100
I'm kind of pissed off.

704
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,800
Why?
What happened?

705
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
Just some nonsense
quentin said to me.

706
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,600
You know, sometimes that kid's
got a big mouth, man.

707
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,400
What's up?

708
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,700
Uh, millicent is gonna move in
after all.

709
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,700
Fine with me.

710
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,000
Hey, about time we classed up
the place a little bit, huh?

711
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,100
Well, speaking of,
you think we could?

712
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,400
You ow, straighten up a little
and straighten up a little?

713
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,100
Oh, you talkin'
about all the sex talk

714
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,400
And foul language, right?

715
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,300
Yeah.

716
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
Good luck with that.

717
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,900
Come on, skills.

718
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,500
I'm not saying
everybody has to be a saint,

719
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,100
But millicent's a girl,
you know?

720
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,500
And she's my girl.

721
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,500
All right.
I'll talk to the fellas.

722
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,700
It's all good, baby.

723
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,500
All right, thanks.

724
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,000
Hey, you think she could walk
around in her --
No.

725
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,500
I didn't think so.

726
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,900
New song?

727
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,500
Yeah.

728
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,900
Nice.
Thank you.

729
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,500
Actually, i think i'm gonna
record that album with peyton.

730
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,400
Really?
Yeah.

731
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,600
That's great, haley.

732
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,900
Yes, it is.
Yeah.

733
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,100
How'd your workout go?

734
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,500
Not so good.

735
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,200
But you know what?

736
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,500
Whatever happens,
we're gonna be fine.

737
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,400
Yeah, we will.

738
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,800
Deb: hello?

739
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,500
Who is that?

740
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,900
That's the new nanny
mama hired.

741
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,900
Did someone call
for a nanny?

742
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,900
Grandma!

743
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,300
What did i
tell you about that?

744
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,700
Grandma deb is way too young
to be a grandma.

745
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,300
Sorry.
Nanny deb!

746
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,700
Oh, i like that
so much better.

747
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,100
Hi, mom.

748
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,600
Hey, mom,
you look great.
Ooh, thank you.

749
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,800
??

750
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,600
<i>It's been said that the saddest
thing a man will ever face</i>

751
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,100
<i>Is what might have been.</i>

752
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,300
<i>But what of the man
who's faced with what was?</i>

753
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,300
<i>Or what may never be?</i>

754
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:44,800
<i>Or what can no longer be?</i>

755
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,300
You did the right thing,
skills.

756
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,300
And one of these days,
"q" is gonna realize that.

757
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,000
Now we just got to figure out
a way to win without him.

758
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,800
<i>Choosing the right path
is never easy.</i>

759
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,500
<i>It's a decision we make with
only our hearts to guide us.</i>

760
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,200
<i>But sometimes we find our way
to something better.</i>

761
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,100
Hey, brooke, come on.

762
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,600
We got to get to the airport
to pick up that baby.

763
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,000
I think
i need to do this alone.

764
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,500
I'm gonna be okay.

765
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:28,900
Okay.

766
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:33,700
Okay.

767
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,700
<i>Sometimes we fight
through the regret and remorse
of our mistakes --</i>

768
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,700
<i>Our malice and our jealousy</i>

769
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,800
<i>And the shame we feel
for not being the people
we were meant to be.</i>

770
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,500
<i>And that's when we find our way
to something better...</i>

771
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,700
<i>...or when something better
finds its way to us.</i>

772
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,900
???

773
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,400
??????
