00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,839
<i>Previously on "one tree hill"...</i>

2
00:00:01,922 --> 00:00:03,017
you were at that party that night,

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,883
but you didn't have sex
with nathan scott, did you ?

4
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:05,983
No.

5
00:00:06,066 --> 00:00:07,449
It's over.

6
00:00:07,532 --> 00:00:09,217
Dan : i'd been given
only days to live.

7
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,416
That was 14 months ago.

8
00:00:11,499 --> 00:00:14,117
So how'd you know she was lying ?
Takes a con to know a con.

9
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,184
Brooke : that night you said you were
gonna take that movie in new zealand,

10
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,349
i wrote "marry me" in the sand,
and then i didn't tell you

11
00:00:19,432 --> 00:00:20,616
because you said you were leaving.

12
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:21,699
I didn't know.

13
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,284
Hey.

14
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:25,850
I think you should go home to david.

15
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:28,050
Sara : i don't want you
to be alone, honey.

16
00:00:28,133 --> 00:00:29,783
Why'd you send her away ?

17
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:33,550
I loved you so much, sara.
I don't want to lose us.

18
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,033
But now it's time to let go.

19
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,566
<i>Don't worry, senor.</i>

20
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:05,300
You won't feel a thing.

21
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:11,716
So, tell me, doc. How many
heart transplants have you done ?

22
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:14,650
<i>Dos o tres.</i>

23
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:16,466
<i>mas o menos.</i>

24
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:20,817
Whoa, whoa, wait.

25
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,416
Doc, i-i'm -- i'm not under yet.

26
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,616
I'm still here.

27
00:01:23,699 --> 00:01:25,750
Hey, doc, doc, doc, i'm still here.

28
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,616
I'm still here, doc.

29
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:29,983
[ speaking spanish ] i'm still here.

30
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:31,983
I'm still here !

31
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:33,166
I'm still here !

32
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,416
It's okay, baby.

33
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:39,184
It's okay.

34
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:41,883
It was a dream, right ?

35
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:43,033
It was just another dream.

36
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:48,716
He's going.

37
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,483
All right, haley, i just wanted

38
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:52,883
to spend this weekend
with my son and my friends.

39
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:54,250
I barely even know this guy.

40
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,616
He's going.

41
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,783
You're going.

42
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,683
An entire weekend in the woods --

43
00:01:58,766 --> 00:02:01,083
you realize i know nothing
about camping ?

44
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,316
What does this guy even know
about camping ?

45
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:05,250
He makes movies --
and not very good ones.

46
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,117
Julian lives in tree hill now.

47
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,217
It's time he hung out with the guys.

48
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,850
I'm not a guy's guy.
I don't have homies.

49
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:17,150
I don't think anyone
has had homies since 1989.

50
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:19,150
I'm just saying my close friends
have always been girls.

51
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:20,583
You mean like alex ?

52
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:23,349
Yes, exactly like...

53
00:02:23,432 --> 00:02:25,432
i'm going.

54
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:28,333
Yeah.

55
00:02:41,499 --> 00:02:44,383
Hi, clay.

56
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:46,466
You know how cute
i always thought you were.

57
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:09,683
Oh, i bet you'd like that,
wouldn't you, you perv ?

58
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:11,683
I-i'm sorry.

59
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:13,783
"Fast times" was on cable
last night.

60
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:16,699
Show a little respect
for the dead, you goof.

61
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,950
Sara.

62
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:23,783
This isn't healthy, is it ?

63
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:25,483
Oh, i don't know --
probably healthier

64
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:27,817
than all the women you've had
in your pool in real life.

65
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,716
Then again,
skipping the guys'weekend

66
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:33,983
to spend time with your dead wife...

67
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:37,033
probably not so healthy.

68
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,983
Man, when i said guys'weekend,

69
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:59,050
i pictured us by the pool
at the bellagio,

70
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:01,416
room and drinks comped all'cause
we're rolling with nathan scott.

71
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:03,284
Yeah, that's exactly
what i wanted --

72
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:05,150
a weekend
in some casino sports book --

73
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:07,516
50 tvs, 50 stations,
none of which will hire me.

74
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,316
Yeah, but the damn woods,

75
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:12,449
with hungry animals
and dudes with hockey masks ?

76
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:14,616
Come on, man. Camping's a great
way to forget your life.

77
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:15,917
No tv, no internet, no cellphones.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,466
Yeah.
No way to call for help.

79
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:21,066
No, i guess it'll be all right.

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,316
Hi, coach skills.

81
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,833
Aw, chuck.

82
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:34,017
And above all, just be yourself.

83
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,799
Brooke, it's a camping trip,
not the first day of school.

84
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:39,783
Well, did you remember to bring

85
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:41,449
a little thermos
with the sippy cup ?

86
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,300
I got it covered.

87
00:04:46,532 --> 00:04:49,850
Geez, eddie bauer !
Did you buy the whole catalog ?

88
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:53,100
First rule of camping --
be prepared.

89
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,833
I think.

90
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,917
First rule of camping --
travel light.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,633
Attention, all campers.

92
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,449
Bill murray ?
"Meatballs"?

93
00:05:07,532 --> 00:05:09,917
Hey, look, everyone.
It's julian.

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,264
Who the hell is julian ?

95
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,917
Have a good weekend !
See ya ! see ya !

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,250
See ya, fellas.

97
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,250
Bye, guys.
Have fun. Be safe.

98
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,050
You think we'll ever
see them again ?

99
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:23,783
Oh, i wouldn't worry.

100
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:26,399
Julian has enough equipment to
survive in the woods for seven years.

101
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:29,449
Well, i hope you're ready
for girls'night,

102
00:05:29,532 --> 00:05:32,583
'cause quinn made brownies.

103
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,184
Brownies !

104
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,284
Mmm.
They smell incredible.

105
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:38,449
They should.
They're taylor's recipe.

106
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:42,100
Oh, sweet.
I love taylor's brownies.

107
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,483
When hales was in high school,

108
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:47,550
she used get all stressed
about grades and tests,

109
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:49,316
and we would always make
special brownies.

110
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,950
Special brownies ?

111
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:53,150
Yeah, you know, the usual --

112
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:56,284
eggs, milk, brownie mix...
a little weed.

113
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:58,050
Does she know that ?

114
00:05:58,133 --> 00:05:59,954
No.

115
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,950
Looks like the boys
aren't the only ones

116
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,699
going on a trip tonight.

117
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:38,317
Who wants to get their
"go get me a beer" badge ?

118
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,716
I do ! i do !

119
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,166
Nice.

120
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,183
So, this is the same tent
the japanese climbers took

121
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:48,449
to the top of mt. Everest.

122
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:50,583
Well, then you should be good here,

123
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,983
100 feet above sea level.

124
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:55,367
If only the instructions
weren't also in japanese.

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,033
Well, i think
that looks pretty good.

126
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,966
So, would you call that
a two-man tent ?

127
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,799
You might want to slow down
a little.

128
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:19,325
That was the thing about
Taylor's brownies.

129
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:20,783
The more i eat, the hungrier i get.

130
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:21,866
Yeah, there's a reason for that.

131
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:27,066
It's girls'night, right --
all about spilling secrets ?

132
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:32,350
Oh, no.
What'd you guys do ?

133
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:35,449
Okay, taylor's recipe
calls for an eighth

134
00:07:35,532 --> 00:07:36,983
of granddaddy purple.

135
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:38,733
What is that, some kind
of breakfast cereal ?

136
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:42,733
Not exactly.

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,400
Pot ?!

138
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,183
I have to go throw up.

139
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:51,416
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

140
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:53,449
Oh, relax, haley-bob.
You're about to, anyway.

141
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:54,816
I do not believe, all those years,

142
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:56,150
you and tay were getting me high.

143
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:59,616
Yeah, who knew tutor girl
was actually stoner girl ?

144
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:03,883
We never gave you the
full-strength recipe until now.

145
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:05,883
I can't do this.
I have a child !

146
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:07,683
Who is away for the weekend.

147
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:10,616
You have had
a rough couple of months.

148
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:14,100
It is perfectly acceptable
to mellow out a little.

149
00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:17,384
I'm so getting you back for this.

150
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:20,017
Oh, come tomorrow,
you'll be thanking me.

151
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,217
Well, maybe i've built up
an immunity to these brownies.

152
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,266
I mean, i've had two already,
and i don't feel anything.

153
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:34,683
Now, when they say they
represent the lollipop guild,

154
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:36,350
do you think that's a trade union ?

155
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,050
And if it is,
why did they unionize ?

156
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:39,516
Did they need shorter hours

157
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,317
or longer sticks
or different flavors ?

158
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,799
Look at their little suits.
They really crack me up.

159
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,783
Wow.
That didn't take very long.

160
00:08:47,866 --> 00:08:49,833
Brooke, are you okay ?

161
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:53,449
Will you please tell that munchkin

162
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:56,033
to stop looking at me ?

163
00:08:57,733 --> 00:09:00,200
Great. She gets chatty,
and you get paranoid.

164
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,866
A classic overcorrection.

165
00:09:20,566 --> 00:09:25,571
Just give me something
simple, elegant, beautiful.

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,716
You just described
everything i love about you.

167
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,083
I thought you didn't believe
in love.

168
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,683
Isn't that what you told
that girl kylie ?

169
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:40,017
I meant...

170
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,850
i could never love anyone
as much as i loved you.

171
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:44,783
Except for quinn.

172
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:47,950
It's not like that with quinn.

173
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:50,566
I could always tell
when you were lying.

174
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:57,716
The ratings are in.

175
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,950
Last week's show with renee
was our highest ever.

176
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,050
I'm glad.

177
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:03,883
We have momentum.

178
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:05,616
We need something big for sweeps,

179
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:07,183
and then dr. Phil can suck it.

180
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:09,917
Well, maybe we can get lucas
to do a guest spot.

181
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,966
It's not like he's doing anything.

182
00:10:13,266 --> 00:10:15,766
Hey, lena, beat it.
He's got enough eyeliner.

183
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,850
Okay.
What's going on ?

184
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,750
Does this have anything
to do with the fact

185
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,616
that nathan never called
to say thank you ?

186
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:26,883
Of course not.
I never expected that.

187
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:29,816
Good, because we both know
that's not gonna happen.

188
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:32,583
Now get your head in the game.

189
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,300
We have an empire to build.

190
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:45,583
Alex isn't that bad
once you get to know her.

191
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,650
I'm just saying
i've known brooke a long time.

192
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:50,217
I saw how hard it was for her
to get over a broken heart.

193
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,284
Well, nobody's gonna break
brooke's heart.

194
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:57,083
Well, good,'cause if you do,
you'll answer to me.

195
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,816
Yeah, and i seen him naked.
He been working out.

196
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,983
Hanging with the guys rules.

197
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:04,350
So, how you doing, chuck ?

198
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:06,750
My mom says
you can't marry miss lauren

199
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,017
'cause you don't make enough money.

200
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,750
Ah, well, guess who just lost

201
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,549
their "keep their
damn mouth shut" badge.

202
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:14,850
So, over the last few months,

203
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:16,384
with everything
that's been going on,

204
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,783
maybe you were kind of scared ?

205
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:18,950
Jamie : not really.

206
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:22,133
I knew grandpa dan
would save us again.

207
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:26,733
So, can we forgive him now ?

208
00:11:29,632 --> 00:11:32,150
Last week i helped
a confused young woman

209
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:36,300
free herself from her tangled
web of lies and deceit.

210
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,416
But tonight is about you.

211
00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:46,616
So tonight i ask you
to turn your gaze inward

212
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:51,350
and confess the truth
inside yourself...

213
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:54,300
to turn your gaze inward...

214
00:11:57,599 --> 00:12:00,333
... and confess.

215
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,384
And confess --

216
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:14,367
confess the tru--

217
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,266
we should've saved that for sweeps.

218
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,517
That was awesome !

219
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,317
One bravery badge coming right up.

220
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,216
Whoa.

221
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:45,767
It's your turn, j. Luke !

222
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,483
It's so far down.

223
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:53,066
This was my favorite part
of camping when i was your age.

224
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,066
All right, jimmy-jam.
See what you got.

225
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:01,750
I can't do it.

226
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,949
[ chuckles ]
what are you talking about ?

227
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:07,166
It's -- it's too high.
I'm going back down the trail.

228
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,383
I better go with julian.

229
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:11,466
Jamie, we've been talking
about this for weeks, man.

230
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:17,417
But he might get lost.

231
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,066
That's true.
I am directionally challenged.

232
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,566
Okay. Well, i guess i'll see
you guys at the bottom, then.

233
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,717
Whew.
Thanks, man.

234
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,266
No problem.

235
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:33,333
Here.

236
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,483
You're a genius, you know that ?

237
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:39,949
I mean, who could miss
a single episode

238
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:43,183
when dan scott could keel over
and die at any minute ?

239
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:46,450
I saw something out there, rachel,

240
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:47,999
in the audience.

241
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:54,066
A boy -- he was bleeding.

242
00:13:57,032 --> 00:13:59,816
Felt like my heart was
gonna burst out of my chest.

243
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:01,916
You're crazy.

244
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:04,500
Your heart's fine.

245
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:09,016
Without a new heart,
you're gonna die.

246
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,099
Maybe i want to die.

247
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:16,116
Lon called from putnam and pratt.

248
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:18,750
He read the first three chapters
of the book.

249
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,883
He says it's gonna be a bestseller.

250
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:25,350
Think of all the good we'll do,
all the people we'll help.

251
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:26,883
All the money we'll make ?

252
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,999
That too.

253
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,784
How much is this heart costing us ?

254
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:35,016
$5,000.

255
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:37,550
That's very reasonable.

256
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:38,767
It's a fortune to these people.

257
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:43,333
Now get some sleep.

258
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:47,433
Tomorrow you're gonna be a new man.

259
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,583
Sara, did you feel any pain...

260
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,450
when you died, in that moment ?

261
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,417
No.

262
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,099
Well, i did.

263
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,784
And i do, every day.
And it's not fair.

264
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:18,816
Life isn't fair, clay.

265
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:23,904
But you being miserable
is never gonna change that.

266
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,849
These leftovers are incredible.

267
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:38,533
I am such a good cook.

268
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:45,916
What's going on with you
and the hot agent ?

269
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:47,199
Clay ?

270
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:53,308
Who are we talking about ?
Nathan's agent, clay.

271
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:55,517
Right.

272
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,383
Is something going on
with the two of you ?

273
00:15:57,466 --> 00:16:01,183
No, but it's better that way.

274
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:04,216
My psychic told me to avoid
emotional entanglements.

275
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:05,617
You have a psychic ?

276
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,050
She's not really mine.

277
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,583
Her name's zelda.

278
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,050
Oh, my god.
She does house calls.

279
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:14,550
Oh, my god.
We are totally calling her.

280
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:16,350
No.
No, no. No.

281
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:19,483
Please, no creepy psychic --
i can't handle it right now.

282
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:22,666
See if she can bring us a pizza.

283
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:29,916
We did this
in a movie i just produced.

284
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:31,466
We just need one spark.

285
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,483
All right, spielberg.

286
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,299
Why don't you produce us
some marshmallows ?

287
00:16:45,266 --> 00:16:48,083
So, the girl say
she thinks she heard a noise

288
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,983
scratching on the car door, right ?

289
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:51,483
So she freak out.

290
00:16:51,566 --> 00:16:54,350
She tell the dude,
"take me home now."

291
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:56,883
So of course he get all mad

292
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:59,317
because he know he's not getting
no action tonight, right ?

293
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,883
So he drive the girl
all the way home.

294
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:03,417
And get out the car to try
to help her out, you know ?

295
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,016
And there on the door handle
was a bloody hook.

296
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,983
That story isn't scary,

297
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:12,150
not when you have a bravery badge.

298
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:14,517
You want to hear something
really scary ?

299
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,083
Bring it, julia.

300
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,150
Okay.

301
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:21,517
Well, this is a true story
about an old witch

302
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,400
who used to live
in these very woods.

303
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,250
Her name was drag-leg laura.

304
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,283
And they called her that
because she had a wooden leg.

305
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:33,550
And you could always
hear laura coming

306
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:37,066
because she would drag it
behind her in the mud.

307
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,417
Well, the day after laura died,

308
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,517
some kids decided that
they wanted to dig up her body

309
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,183
and steal the wooden leg.

310
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:52,750
So they took it back to their tent.

311
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:56,450
And then, just about midnight,
on a night just like tonight,

312
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,233
they heard it.

313
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:02,867
Laura was coming back for her leg.

314
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:09,150
Wow.
That was fast.

315
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:10,583
It's because she's a psychic,

316
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,383
so she probably knew
that we were going to call her

317
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,684
and started heading over here.

318
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:15,150
This is so creepy.

319
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:18,032
Oh, i'm sure she's not that creepy.

320
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:24,433
Okay, she's creepy.

321
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:33,050
Nice going, hollywood.

322
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:36,017
You scared the piss out of chuck.

323
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,733
Good thing his mama packed
extra underwear.

324
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:41,817
Drag-leg laura works every time.

325
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,717
I wasn't scared.
It's just a story.

326
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,650
Drag-leg laura, zip-lines --

327
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:48,650
we're all scared of something.

328
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:50,483
Not my dad.

329
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:53,450
All right, buddy.
I think it's time for bed.

330
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,216
All right.
Good night, guys.

331
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:56,650
Good night.
Good night.

332
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:59,483
Dad, i'm sorry
i didn't do the zip-line.

333
00:18:59,566 --> 00:19:00,717
It's okay, buddy.

334
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,783
Maybe tomorrow, if you want, huh ?

335
00:19:02,866 --> 00:19:04,683
Sure.
All right.

336
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:06,499
Come here. Ah.

337
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:19,516
A million dollars for your thoughts.

338
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,000
And i'll throw in back-end points.

339
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:25,416
Just thinking about sweeps.

340
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:28,366
You're right.
We need something big.

341
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:33,583
Maybe i come clean, show them
all that i've got a new heart,

342
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,783
that i'm not really living
on borrowed time.

343
00:19:35,866 --> 00:19:38,183
You do that, and all this goes away.

344
00:19:38,266 --> 00:19:40,283
Maybe not.

345
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:42,516
Maybe they've really been
listening to what i've been saying,

346
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,017
and maybe they'll forgive me.

347
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,950
No.

348
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:48,084
They'll tolerate a criminal.

349
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:49,750
They'll look the other way
at murder.

350
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,750
But if they find out
that behind the curtain

351
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,750
oz is just a man,
they'll never forgive you.

352
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:57,733
Eventually that clock has to
stop ticking, rachel.

353
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,917
Does it ?

354
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,450
You've given these people
something to believe in.

355
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:08,133
Don't take it away
to quiet your own guilt.

356
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,399
Thanks.

357
00:20:22,232 --> 00:20:25,149
I never said thank you, mouth.

358
00:20:25,232 --> 00:20:27,183
You don't have to.

359
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:30,149
Yeah, but you spoke up for me
when nobody else would.

360
00:20:30,232 --> 00:20:32,199
I'm really sorry
you lost your job, man.

361
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,766
There any chance
they take you back ?

362
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,183
Probably not.

363
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:42,950
I committed the cardinal sin
of broadcasting.

364
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,249
I told people to turn the channel.

365
00:20:45,332 --> 00:20:47,383
Networks don't really like that.

366
00:20:47,466 --> 00:20:51,050
Yeah, well, the whole landscape
of television is changing anyway.

367
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:52,883
Yeah, but what's next ?

368
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:54,984
The internet --

369
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:57,766
it's faster, it's cheaper,
and it's everywhere.

370
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:02,817
Is your career path pretty much
just laid out for you

371
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,383
as soon as your parents
name you zelda ?

372
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:08,950
Zelda. It's kind of like
if they call you bambi or oprah.

373
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:12,116
What are your questions
for the universe, my child ?

374
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:15,683
I'm sorry.
Okay.

375
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:20,771
Will nathan play for the bobcats
this season ?

376
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,216
Prospects are hazy.
Ask again.

377
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:35,050
You sound like
one of those magic 8-balls.

378
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:38,033
You sound like you've been
eating pot brownies.

379
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:45,116
Okay, best sports movie ever.

380
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:47,249
Easy.
"Field of dreams."

381
00:21:47,332 --> 00:21:48,984
I'm gonna go with "coach carter."

382
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:50,133
Ooh, strong.

383
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,466
"Cool runnings."

384
00:21:55,332 --> 00:21:57,416
Seriously ?
Yeah.

385
00:21:57,499 --> 00:21:59,516
What, all the sports movies
of all time,

386
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,183
and you're gonna -- you're gonna
pick "cool runnings"?

387
00:22:02,266 --> 00:22:03,499
Yeah. I like it.

388
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:14,950
"Hoosiers" -- hands down,
best sports movie ever made.

389
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,416
You're right --
definitely "hoosiers."

390
00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:18,783
I know the guy who coordinated
the basketball for that movie.

391
00:22:18,866 --> 00:22:20,416
What's that ?

392
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:22,717
Well, you know, the actors don't
just make that stuff up.

393
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,216
There's a sports coordinator on set

394
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:25,466
who comes up with all the plays.

395
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:33,984
I'm sensing something.

396
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:36,017
It's julian, isn't it ?

397
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,683
It's julian.

398
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:40,183
And he's --

399
00:22:40,266 --> 00:22:42,350
conflicted about something, right ?

400
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:43,717
Exactly.

401
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,850
It's --

402
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:46,116
alex dupré?

403
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,149
Yes.

404
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:50,183
It's alex dupré.

405
00:22:50,266 --> 00:22:51,617
I knew it.

406
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,433
Zelda, you're good.

407
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:57,550
You're creepy as hell,
but you are good.

408
00:22:57,633 --> 00:23:00,617
Let's talk about what alex dupré
look like naked.

409
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,017
Oh, let me guess -- chase adams.

410
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,216
I thought bartenders

411
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,917
were supposed to keep
their mouths shut.

412
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,383
Yeah, and they're also supposed
to make good drinks, too.

413
00:23:08,466 --> 00:23:11,650
All : enjoy the buzz.

414
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:13,483
So, that's what you meant

415
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:14,950
by not that bad
once you get to know her.

416
00:23:15,033 --> 00:23:16,917
It was a misunderstanding --

417
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,116
a very brief, somewhat naked
misunderstanding.

418
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,783
Yeah, there ain't nothing wrong

419
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:23,917
with a little window-shopping,
either, right ?

420
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,883
Yeah, well, she's no brooke davis.

421
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:28,232
But you guys have all seen her
naked on film.

422
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:31,717
Wait.
Who we talking about ?

423
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,183
Alex -- she's the only actress
in hollywood

424
00:23:34,266 --> 00:23:36,366
who insists on doing nudity.

425
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:40,067
Yeah, alex -- that's --
that's what i thought.

426
00:23:43,866 --> 00:23:45,067
Wait, who are you talking about ?

427
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,466
Skills.

428
00:23:51,366 --> 00:23:52,466
Skills.
Skills.

429
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:56,332
Nathan and brooke kind of made
a sex tape in high school.

430
00:23:58,633 --> 00:23:59,950
Okay.

431
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:01,299
Good night.

432
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,917
See you guys in the morning.

433
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,332
Or maybe just one of you.

434
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:24,416
I never told nathan we were married.

435
00:24:24,499 --> 00:24:25,966
Why not ?

436
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:30,516
There was never a good time.

437
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:32,917
To mention you had a wife ?

438
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,283
I know.

439
00:24:35,366 --> 00:24:37,383
It's just...

440
00:24:37,466 --> 00:24:38,850
people mean well,

441
00:24:38,933 --> 00:24:41,883
but they don't really know
what to say.

442
00:24:41,966 --> 00:24:44,366
They try, but just...

443
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:50,366
... after a while,
it was just easier not to.

444
00:24:52,232 --> 00:24:56,249
For who -- you or them ?

445
00:24:56,332 --> 00:24:58,783
I don't know.

446
00:24:58,866 --> 00:25:01,199
Them ?

447
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,399
Both, maybe.

448
00:25:07,499 --> 00:25:09,466
Well, it might help you
to tell someone.

449
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:15,167
And it might really help you
to tell the right someone.

450
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,850
There's a man in your life.

451
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:23,416
He's suffered a great loss.

452
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:25,050
He's struggling.

453
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:27,183
My husband, david.

454
00:25:27,266 --> 00:25:30,084
No, it's not david.

455
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:32,984
But whoever it is,

456
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:36,167
i'm getting the strong feeling
that he needs you right now.

457
00:25:39,966 --> 00:25:43,984
Ooh, magic 8-ball,
is zelda really psychic ?

458
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:46,750
What ?
Outlook not so good.

459
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:48,033
I told you.
She's a total fake.

460
00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:53,650
Magic 8-ball, is zelda standing
right behind us ?

461
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:55,033
You may rely on it.

462
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:04,216
You're not alone in this house.

463
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:05,683
What ?

464
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:08,183
Wait !
Zelda, you can't do that.

465
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:12,933
Oryctolagus cuniculus.

466
00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:17,783
She just cursed us.

467
00:26:17,866 --> 00:26:21,783
Quinn, your creepy psychic
just cursed us.

468
00:26:21,866 --> 00:26:24,183
Okay.
On that note, i got to go.

469
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:26,316
No, quinn, you can't --
the brownies.

470
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:29,717
Yeah, i didn't actually have
any brownies.

471
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,116
Someone had to keep an eye
on you two rookies.

472
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:34,299
And you're gonna come down
any minute, i promise.

473
00:26:36,566 --> 00:26:39,050
I knew that woman would bring
a demon into your house.

474
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:41,350
Hey, that's kind of harsh.
She's still my sister.

475
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,516
Not quinn.
Zelda.

476
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,149
She said we're not alone.

477
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:49,266
Oh, stop it.
I'm sure we're perfectly safe.

478
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:01,516
If there is an evil spirit
in this house,

479
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:04,549
this is definitely the best way
to keep it from killing us.

480
00:27:04,632 --> 00:27:07,117
It's just a mass-produced
board game, dude.

481
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,850
That doesn't matter, dude.

482
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:11,117
Now, what did zelda say ?

483
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,217
Oryctolagus something.

484
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,883
Oryctolagus...
cunniling--

485
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:21,283
it wasn't that.
You're so bad.

486
00:27:21,366 --> 00:27:23,433
You're right.
I wouldn't be afraid of that.

487
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:27,283
Okay. Let's do it. Okay.

488
00:27:27,366 --> 00:27:29,750
Oh, great ouija board,

489
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:33,799
is there a mean spirit
in this house ?

490
00:27:35,632 --> 00:27:37,183
You're pushing it.
I'm not, i swear.

491
00:27:37,266 --> 00:27:38,699
You totally are. I'm not.
Okay, fine, don't touch it.

492
00:27:43,266 --> 00:27:45,683
Ouija board...

493
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:49,632
is there anyone in this house ?

494
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:59,983
So, let me get this straight.

495
00:28:00,066 --> 00:28:02,516
You were on a break from peyton --

496
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,350
nathan : oh, come on.
It was eight years ago.

497
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,450
I was so drunk,
i don't even remember.

498
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:07,516
Well, good thing you got it on tape.

499
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:09,033
Just let it go.

500
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,983
It's a nice tent.

501
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:16,117
I have a lambskin sleeping bag.
I'm quite warm.

502
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,950
Don't change the subject.

503
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:21,783
Look, i get it.

504
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,516
The idea of me and brooke
is weird for you.

505
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:27,616
I lost my virginity
to my sister-in-law.

506
00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:29,117
You don't think
that makes thanksgiving

507
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,467
a little awkward from time to time ?

508
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:35,017
You still awake ?

509
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,916
Yeah.

510
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:38,850
What'd you think
about what julian said ?

511
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:42,250
I don't know.
Maybe he's right.

512
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:44,484
<i>Maybe i could have my own
sports show on the internet.</i>

513
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:46,183
Then i could say anything i want.

514
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:50,066
Call the website
something like raw mouth.

515
00:28:51,866 --> 00:28:54,066
I'm pretty sure
that's already taken.

516
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:58,317
My father's new wife is my age,

517
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,883
and she hit on me after she
slept with my uncle cooper.

518
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:03,283
Yeah.

519
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:06,250
Don't even get me started on my dad.

520
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,283
Yeah, your old man and my old man

521
00:29:08,366 --> 00:29:10,233
should get together and go bowling.

522
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:13,150
"Breakfast club."

523
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:15,716
You really got to quit
with the movie quotes, man.

524
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:17,983
I can quit that.

525
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:20,783
But i wish i knew how to quit you.

526
00:29:20,866 --> 00:29:23,450
Okay, so enough about
your new porn site.

527
00:29:23,533 --> 00:29:25,716
I'm talking
about the "hoosiers" thing.

528
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:26,950
See, i was planning on starting

529
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:28,250
my own business
training athletes, right ?

530
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,083
But sports coordinating --

531
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:32,583
i think i'd be good at that.

532
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:34,133
You'd be great at that.

533
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:41,183
Julian's cool.

534
00:29:41,266 --> 00:29:43,150
That's not cool, man.

535
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:44,883
Lighten up, francis.

536
00:29:44,966 --> 00:29:47,417
Everybody loves a good
"brokeback mountain" joke.

537
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,716
Not when you're over there

538
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,250
sleeping in your lambskin condom.

539
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:51,649
Oh, you should talk.

540
00:29:51,732 --> 00:29:53,599
You're the one who showers
with dudes on a nightly basis.

541
00:29:55,233 --> 00:29:56,233
You think drag-leg laura is real ?

542
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:01,333
<i>Nah.
I can tell you a real story.</i>

543
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:10,171
It's about this girl
named nanny carrie.

544
00:30:10,699 --> 00:30:14,183
And it actually happened...

545
00:30:14,266 --> 00:30:15,866
to me.

546
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,283
You're good with the kid,
you know that ?

547
00:30:20,366 --> 00:30:23,417
I've had my moments, believe me.

548
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,083
Yeah, but your dad was a dick,

549
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:27,766
and yet somehow you turned it
around for your own son.

550
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,833
They should give a merit badge
for that.

551
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,283
Zelda said julian's conflicted
about something.

552
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:42,950
I -- listen, i realize the irony

553
00:30:43,033 --> 00:30:45,283
of the following statement,

554
00:30:45,366 --> 00:30:49,283
but you can't take everything
zelda says too seriously.

555
00:30:49,366 --> 00:30:52,883
I feel it, haley.

556
00:30:52,966 --> 00:30:55,183
Brooke, that boy loves you.

557
00:30:55,266 --> 00:30:58,950
He would move mountains for you
if you asked him to.

558
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:01,683
I don't know.

559
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:04,616
What if the guy i want to spend
the rest of my life with

560
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:06,549
doesn't feel the same way ?

561
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:09,117
That's just the brownies talking.

562
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,783
No, i think they're wearing off.

563
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:15,117
Julian : i could see spending
the rest of my life with brooke,

564
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,983
but i know she wants kids.

565
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:19,567
And i don't know
if i'm ready for that.

566
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,183
I don't know if i'll ever be.

567
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:25,283
Jamie likes you.

568
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:27,217
Jamie likes that i suck at stuff.

569
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,649
What do you mean ?

570
00:31:28,732 --> 00:31:31,283
I'm just saying when you have
superman for a father,

571
00:31:31,366 --> 00:31:33,599
sometimes it's nice
to hang around with clark kent.

572
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,783
Rain ? Really ?

573
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:42,283
I wouldn't worry.

574
00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:44,716
I hear lambskin is the safest
form of protection.

575
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:45,799
You'll be fine.

576
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,666
All right.
Come on.

577
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:00,017
You should've gone
on the camping trip.

578
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,916
I wanted to spend time with you.

579
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:04,999
You're not with me, clay.
You're alone.

580
00:32:06,732 --> 00:32:08,467
And i don't want you to be.

581
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:16,333
What can i say ?
I'm good.

582
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,966
Let her in.

583
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:38,716
Hi.

584
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,983
Hey.

585
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:42,350
Look, i know this
is gonna sound weird,

586
00:32:42,433 --> 00:32:44,649
but are you okay ?

587
00:32:44,732 --> 00:32:47,549
Yeah. I'm fine.
Why ?

588
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,750
Well, it's just -- never mind.

589
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:52,533
Can i come in ?

590
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:56,484
No.

591
00:32:56,567 --> 00:32:59,283
When are you gonna get it, quinn ?

592
00:32:59,366 --> 00:33:01,816
You can't be here.

593
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:03,599
You need to go.

594
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,983
I'm sorry.

595
00:33:37,066 --> 00:33:39,117
I don't get it.

596
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,816
I-i don't even know what i'm doing.

597
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:42,816
I mean, i don't know
what we're doing.

598
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:43,966
Are we even doing anything ?

599
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,916
I like you, quinn.

600
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:49,632
It -- it's just...

601
00:33:53,066 --> 00:33:54,666
her name was sara.

602
00:33:58,966 --> 00:34:00,866
And i loved her.

603
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,467
She was my wife.

604
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,783
But, um...

605
00:34:09,866 --> 00:34:11,999
she died.

606
00:34:14,066 --> 00:34:19,071
And i've never told anyone...
up until now.

607
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,500
It was sudden.

608
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:37,883
It was just one minute
she was there,

609
00:34:37,966 --> 00:34:39,833
and the next she was gone.

610
00:34:42,266 --> 00:34:45,516
So that's when i just threw
myself into my work.

611
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,217
But i learned that it doesn't
matter how fast you run.

612
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,549
The pain will always run faster.

613
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:54,616
That's when my life

614
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:57,850
just went completely off the rails.

615
00:34:57,933 --> 00:35:01,350
And that's why your agency
sent you to tree hill.

616
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,716
Yeah.

617
00:35:03,799 --> 00:35:06,999
And that's also why i told you
to go back to david.

618
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:11,150
I know what it's like
to lose the one thing

619
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:13,732
that you love more than anything
in this world.

620
00:35:15,567 --> 00:35:18,649
I'm so sorry, clay.

621
00:35:18,732 --> 00:35:21,317
I wish there was something
i could do for you.

622
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,632
You're doing it, quinn.

623
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:43,156
You're alive, baby.
You have a new heart.

624
00:36:15,899 --> 00:36:16,899
Rachel.

625
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:19,983
Where'd you get the heart ?

626
00:36:20,066 --> 00:36:21,983
What are you talking about ?

627
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:24,117
It was a boy, wasn't it ?

628
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,150
He was on life support.

629
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:30,417
I paid his family the money,
and they pulled the plug.

630
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,200
You paid them ?

631
00:36:33,933 --> 00:36:35,583
He might have gotten better.

632
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:38,916
We bought his death.
We killed him.

633
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:41,467
I did what i had to do
to save your life.

634
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,683
I'm not a murderer, dan.

635
00:36:45,766 --> 00:36:47,533
That would be you.

636
00:36:54,266 --> 00:36:56,183
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on ?

637
00:36:56,266 --> 00:36:58,233
Drag-leg laura !
Listen !

638
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,750
That's definitely drag-leg laura.

639
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:03,950
What are we gonna do ?

640
00:37:04,033 --> 00:37:06,350
Well, the only way to get rid of her

641
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,883
is to catch her in the eyes with
the beam of your flashlight.

642
00:37:08,966 --> 00:37:12,233
Don't worry.
My dad will do it.

643
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,850
What ?
No. No.

644
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:19,200
No way i'm going out there, man.
I'm way too scared.

645
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:24,899
All right.
I'll go.

646
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:12,649
Hey, guys, it's not drag-leg laura.

647
00:38:12,732 --> 00:38:14,433
It's just some stupid old gate.

648
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:22,417
Wow, jamie.
That was awesome.

649
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,217
Jamie scott -- one bravery badge.

650
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,317
Yes.

651
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,799
Chuck, you might want to go
change your underwear again.

652
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:33,766
All right, buddy.

653
00:38:37,766 --> 00:38:40,283
Okay.

654
00:38:40,366 --> 00:38:42,716
If this is our last night on
earth, i just want you to know

655
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:44,850
that i am really glad
we are spending it together.

656
00:38:44,933 --> 00:38:46,417
No, this is silly.
You are just paranoid.

657
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,433
We weren't even hearing things.
It was just the brownies.

658
00:38:51,966 --> 00:38:53,599
It's coming from the closet.

659
00:38:58,033 --> 00:38:59,500
Whew.

660
00:39:01,233 --> 00:39:04,117
This is ridiculous.

661
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,283
Cuniculus.

662
00:39:06,366 --> 00:39:07,484
What ?

663
00:39:07,567 --> 00:39:08,616
Oryctolagus...

664
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:09,699
cuniculus ! cuniculus !

665
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,616
That's what zelda said.

666
00:39:12,699 --> 00:39:17,704
The evil spirit...
in the closet.

667
00:39:19,366 --> 00:39:20,467
Here i come.

668
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,117
Wait !

669
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,484
Oryctolagus cuniculus --

670
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:28,083
the latin word

671
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:29,899
for "bunny rabbit."

672
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:34,666
That zelda's a bitch.

673
00:39:36,033 --> 00:39:39,599
Kids are finally back asleep.

674
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:44,183
How'd you know
about the creaky gate ?

675
00:39:44,266 --> 00:39:47,166
Oh, i--i just saw it
when i was out getting firewood.

676
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,150
Nice performance.

677
00:39:51,233 --> 00:39:53,950
Julian.

678
00:39:54,033 --> 00:39:56,484
You knew jamie needed that.

679
00:39:56,567 --> 00:39:59,050
Oh, it was no big deal.

680
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:01,384
Hey, being a father is 95% instinct.

681
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:02,866
And you have good ones.

682
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,333
When the day comes, you'll be ready.

683
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:09,133
Thanks, man.

684
00:40:13,699 --> 00:40:17,150
You know, that was
my first-ever fist bump.

685
00:40:17,233 --> 00:40:18,699
Don't overthink it.

686
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:30,649
Come back to bed, baby.
You need rest.

687
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:34,450
You're right.
I do.

688
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:36,883
In fact, i've been thinking.

689
00:40:36,966 --> 00:40:38,999
Maybe we need a vacation.

690
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:42,484
Now, that's my boy.

691
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:47,572
Where do you want to go --
the bahamas, hawaii ?

692
00:40:49,732 --> 00:40:51,384
Tree hill.

693
00:40:51,467 --> 00:40:53,333
I want to go home.

694
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:58,500
It's almost morning.
I should go.

695
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:04,100
Or, uh, you could stay.

696
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,833
Tell me more about sara.

697
00:41:15,866 --> 00:41:17,951
She would've really liked you.

698
00:41:18,034 --> 00:41:23,039
