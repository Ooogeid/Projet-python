00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,700
??????

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,400
We'll stop her heart,
and then i'll do the repairs.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,600
It's not me that has to make
a decision about lucas.

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,500
It's you.
Go home and read his book.

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,100
Young man: so we're all
just gonna shoot 3s, coach?

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,300
Yeah, for the most part.

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,600
Who's gonna
get us the ball?

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,300
Me.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,800
I need to fix it.

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,000
I need to fix all of it --
You, us.

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,700
I need that peace
before i die.

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,400
Let me help you with what little
time i have left.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,700
Don't deny a dying man
his last wish.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,400
I can never forgive you --
Not now, not ever.

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,000
???

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,900

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,500

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,700
Out of bout
warrior ball.

23
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,600
What?!

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,500
You're kidding me.
On the street, that's assault.

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,200
You're not even gonna call
that a foul in fere?

26
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,100
Brooke.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,600
Hey, mom? Oh!

28
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,200
<i>Man: hi, i'm calling
from dr. Copeland's officefor brook bravis.</i>

29
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,200
<i>Brook, it's urgent
that you call us --</i>

30
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,200
Hello? Uh-Huh.

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,400
Yeah, no, sure, just --

32
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Brooke!
It's angie's surgery!

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,900
Okay, tell me again why angie's
surgery is so last-Minute.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,600
'Cause it's all done
on a volunteer basis.

35
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,100
E surgeons
donate their services,

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,600
So it depends on
when they have an opening

37
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,700
And the right medica
and everything.

38
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,200
I just didn't think
it was gonna be today.

39
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,600
Well, what can i do?

40
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,400
You're doing it.
Thank you.

41
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,500
But would you mind
calling lucas for me?

42
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,300
He's justten
so attached to angie,

43
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,700
And i think
he's gonna want to know.

44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah. Sure. I'll be back.
Okay.

45
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,100
Hey, come on.

46
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,200
Lucas: hey, coach.

47
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,900
Hey.

48
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,800
Uh, thanks for the coffee.

49
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,200
What's up, man?

50
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,800
Uh, you know, i was thinking
maybe we could go over tonight's game plan one more time.

51
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,700
Look, it's gonna work,
bro.

52
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,000
N't, they'll just fire the head coach
and hire me, right?

53
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Win-Win.

54
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,200
So, what else
is bothering you?

55
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Nothing. Why?

56
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,100
'Cause you got that "something
else is bothering me" look.

57
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,200
Come on, keep it real.
Ta to your boy.

58
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,700
Nothing just --

59
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,600
I haven't heard from lindsey
in a while,hi

60
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,200
You know, maybe a week,
and i --

61
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,200
I mean, it's one thing for her
to give me the key back, but...

62
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,100
I mean, she's still editing my book.
I think she's ducking me.

63
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,400
Nah, she's ain't ducking you,
bro.

64
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,700
She's probably just busy.

65
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,100
Yeah.

66
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,700
I just wish she'd call,
you know?

67
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,400
It'll be okay,

68
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,400
But until then,
you know what heals a broken heart more than anything?

69
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,500
Hmm?

70
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,400

Nah, we're good.

00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,300
Maybe we should turn around
and go back.

113
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,300
Why? You don't think i can
make it up this hill?

114
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,200

00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,300
Dr. Copeland.

145
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,800
I hope it's something nice --

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,800
Not like a last name
for a first name...

147
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,500
You know, like "monroe"...
or "madison."

148
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,700
Lucas.

149
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,100

And that they'd let me know as

00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,400
Okay, well, then, uh...

Yeah, thanks.

158
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,400

Bye, luke.

169
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,100
Over the next couple
of months,

170
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,500
You're gonna
start to feel sluggish.

171
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,200
It's important
not to push it.

172
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,600
There is some good news,
though.

173
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,300
What? I've got seven months
to live instead of six?

174
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,900
Use  your physical size
and bloo

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,800
You're number two
on the donor recipient list
for a compatible heart.

176
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,900
Y this pager with youyo24 hours24ay.

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,400
If a heart
becomes available,

178
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,500
We'll have about six hours
tolace it.

179
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,100
Number two, huh?

180
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,200
What's it gonna cost for me
to get to number one?

181
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,800
Well, i'm pretty certain
reverend carter
isn't willint  barter
with his life.

182
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,000
He's in pretty bad shape.
Good man, too.

183
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,300
Good man?

184
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,600
What's that supposed to mean --
"Good man"?

185
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,400
We're not allowed
to discriminate
when it comes to saving lives, dan.

186
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,600
If the hifs, my job is to
place it into whoever needs it.

187
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,800
Oh, i see.

188
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,400
It doesn't matter if they're
miracle workers or murderers.

189
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,900
Hey, sorry.

190
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's okay.
How's brooke?

191
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,800
Um, scared to death
but trying to be brave.

192
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,600
I feel like i should
go by and see her.

193
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,700
??? I already told you,

194
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,500
You are underict orders
not to go anywhere

195
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,900
Until you have recorded
at least one song.

196
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,600
All right, fine.

197
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,800
??????

198
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,900
Maybe i just
don't like peyton.

199
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,100
Oh, damn.
Was that talkback on again?

200
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,600
You want to take care of that
for me, baller?

201
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Grandma -- Uh, i mean,
nanny deb will do it.

202
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,400
Dude, nanny deb
is not your maid.

203
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,000
Actually,
she kind of is.

204
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,200
??????

205
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,500
Recycling --
Now, you little knucklehead.

206
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,100
This is so great, you guys.
Look at you go, peyton.

207
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,500
Me? Look at you .

208
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,700
You've sold nearly
100,000 copies, dude.

209
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,000
Well, hey, man, that's you and haley
and that creepy label guy from l.A.

210
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,600
That you have some sort of weird
sexual tension with.

211
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,900
Ew. No, i don't.

212
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,100
You kind of do.

213
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,500
What about you, rock star?

214
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,000
You got any flings we can scold you about
whilsecretly wanting to hear more?

215
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,800
No, u know how it is,
hay.Haley.

216
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,600
It's a dferent city every
night and press in the morning.

217
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,400
I can't even imagine
having a date,

218
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,800
Let alone
an actual relationship.

219
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,800
Uh, well, you have
plenty of time for boys.

220
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,900
You are, what,
like 18 years old?

221
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,600
Oh, speaking of -- Do you want
to do a psa for rock the vote?

222
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,300
Hell, yes.
That's so cool.

223
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,800
All right, cool.
We'll set it up.

224
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,400
Come here

225
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,200

226
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,100
You coming, haley?

227
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Yeah, i'll --
I'll be right there.

228
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,100
Okay.

229
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,900
Oh, you naughty man.

230
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,300
Hey, mom. Oh!

231
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,400
Damn it, mom!

232
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,800
Doesn't anyone
knock around here?

233
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,000
Geez.

234
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,000
Geez, mom, what if jamie
had walked in?

235
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,300
I thought the door
was locked.

236
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,400
Besides, you said
you were going for a run.

237
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,000
Well, jamie got tired.

238
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,500
Okay, fine, i got tired,
but that's not the point, mom.

239
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,700
What were you doing?

240
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,400
I met someone online.

241
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,000
Ugh. Who?

242
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,700
I don't know exactly.
We've never seen each other.

243
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,000
Well, he's s
parts of me, but --

244
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,600
Stop, okay?

245
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,300
Mom, you're chatting with some
stranger on the internet.

246
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,600
He's very romantic.
He's sensual.

247
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,400
We're arranging to meet soon.

248
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,500
Come on, mom.
This is just weird.

249
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,000
What is so weird about it?

250
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,500
You don't think it's weird
that you're hiding in my spare bedroom flashing some webcam?

251
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,000
I wasn't hiding.

252
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,600
Besides, all those times
you locked yourself in the
bathroom when you were 12?

253
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,300
Okay, stop.
I knew what yowere doing.

254
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,000
Mom.

255
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,700
You were in there
all the time.

256
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,300
Where is jamie, anyway?

257
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,200
I don't know.

258
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,600
I guess i lost track of him
when you blinded me.

259
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,400
Ugh. Jamie!

260
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,400
Jamie

261
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,700
James lucas scott,
what are you doing out on the street alone?

262
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,300
I never told her
i love her.

263
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,100
I just...

264
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,000
I never said it.

265
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,800
Look, i'm sure when angie's
in your arms, she knows it.

266
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,200
Most of time,

267
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,400
Love doesn't really need words,
you know?

268
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,900
Yeah.

269
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,600
So, um, what's going on
with y and owen?

270
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,400
Nothing, apparently.

271
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,300
What's going on
with you and lindsey?

272
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,700
Nothing, apparently.

273
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,500
I don't know.We...

274
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,500
Haven't spoken

275
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,200
She hasn't
returned my calls.

276
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,500
That sucks, luke.
I'm sorri'

277
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,900
You should get out of here.
You've got that game tonight.

278
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,600
I'm okay
for a little while longer.

279
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,800
Okay.

280
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,800
I'll go get us
some coffees.

281
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,000
She'll be in touch.

282
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,800
Lindsey.

283
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,000
I wouldn't read
too much into it.

284
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,200
Yeah.

285
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,100
I'm okay
for a little while longer.

286
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,900
I'm sorry that i didn't mail
your card to your grandfather.

287
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,800
I was just tings

You might be mad
at me for that,

290
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,300
Or you might not
understand i but...

291
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,200

I'm sorry, buddy.

293
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,100
I just wanted him to know
that he still had a friend.

294
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,100
Everyone
should have a friend.

295
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,000
That big cloud
oks like a sheep dog.

296
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,400

First tour bus,

And that pretty much rocked.

I found my 5-Year-Old son
walking alone on the st today.

346
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,900
You know why?
'Cause i lied to him.

347
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,800
I'm worried i'm wasting your
time with this record, peyton.

348
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,700
No, haley,
the record's gonna be great.

00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,800
Well, i hope so,
but what about after that?

350
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,600

that was on my relationship?

359

All right,
so this time it won't be.

360
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,100
This time you'll do it
differently.

Broken wrist and all.

380
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,100
I think so.
Should be a big game.

381
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,700
So grab a camera
and go get me a story.

382
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,400

383
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,600

You really gonna play a kid

They can't defend us full-Court.

402
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,900
No, it'sour worst nightmare.

403
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,300
Check the records
for 3-Point field goals

404
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,800
Attempted and made
in a half.

405
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,700
10 seconds.
10 seconds.

406

Lindsey

417
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,700
Hi

418
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,500
No, i mean, i'm at halftime
of a game, but...

419
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,200
I'm just so glad you called.

420
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,700
Yeah, we're...

421
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,800
We're up by 7.

422
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,200
Oh,  you so much.

423
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,100
Oh.

424
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,100
Come on, defense,
move your feet!

425
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,300
????

426
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,800
"Q", you got to get there!

427
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,400
Coach, i can barely
breathe right now.

428
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,100
Yeah, well, pick it up, or i'll
find someone that wants to play!

429
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,200
Luke.

430
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,700
Unbelievable.
Time-Out!

431
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,900
All right, look.
I know you're tired, okay?

432
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,600
But nothing in this life
comes easy, you hear me?

433
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,800
Nothing.

434
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,500
So suck it up.

435
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,400
Now, we got 3 minutes left, and
we're up by 9 points.

436
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,600
Finish it!

437
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,100
You hear me?
We are not gonna lose this game.

438
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,400
"Ravens" on three.

439
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,700
No.

440
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,200
"Bear creek sucks."

441
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,400
1, 2, 3...

442
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,500
All: bear creek sucks!

443
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,100
You hear that?
They're taunting you.

444
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,400
And they're right.

445
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,600
Their point guard
only has one hand.

446
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,400
Yeah, but it's a good hand,
coach.

447
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,000
All right, then,
here's what we're gonna do.

448
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,000
Whenever he gets the ball,
you foul him.

449
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,100
He'll eitherss h free throws

450
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,200
Or we'll break his other hand.

451
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,500
???

452
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,800
????

453
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,800
1, 2, 3...

454
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,700
All: four-Nine!

455
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,700
Ref, tt's flagra

456
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,100
No, sir.
It's one and one.

457
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,900
Skills: hey, they're playing
hack-A-Shaq.

458
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,900
They gonna send "q"
to the line

459
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,700
And make him shoot
left-Handed free throws.

460
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:15,900
Re nice.

461
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,100
Come on, "q."

462
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,200
Nice shooting, "q."

463
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,900
Let's go, baby.
One more.

464
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,500
Ronnie, come here.

465
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,500
Take out that wrist,
ronnie.

466
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,700
I got it.

467
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,300
Out of bounds.
Warrior ball.

468
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:58,900
What?!

469
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,400
You're kidding me.

470
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,100
On the street, that's assault.
You're not even gonna
call that a foul in here?

471
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,500
Technifoul.

472
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,800
Oh, you're gon
"t" me

473
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,600
<i>You blow the call,
and you're gonna "t" me up?!</i>

474
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,900
You're gonna get tossed,
son.

475
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,600
You need to throw
his dumb ass out.

476
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,100
How do you like it,
punk?

477
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,500
Luke,
what the hell happened?

478
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,900
That kid intentionally tried
to hurt "q," and you saw it.

479
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I know, but, luke,
you grabbed him, man.

480
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,500
I should have
knocked him out!

481
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,300
God!

482
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,100
This is really bad, luke.

483
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,100
She's seeing someone else.

484
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,600
Lindsey.

485
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
She called at halftime.
I...

486
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,300
I can't believe it.

487
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,000
She's supposed to
come back to me.

488
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,200
Luke, i know
you don't want hear this, but...

489
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,300
What if she doesn't?

490
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,300
What ishe's not going to?

491
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,600
You can't wait around
forever.

492
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,900
Maybe it's --

493
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,300
Maybe it's time to te on.

494
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,000
She's supposed to
come back.

495
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,600
Brooke: hi.

496
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,500
Did you win?

497
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,800
I don't know.

498
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:07,900
What?

499
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,100
How's angie?

500
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,400
She's stronger
than i am.

501
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,400
She's breathing
on her own.

502
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,200
They said
she's doing great.

503
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,700
That's good.
That's really good, brooke.

504
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,600
Listen, i appreciate
that you came by,but...

505
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,900
They said

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,400
That's okay. I, um...

507
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,700
Lindsey called.

508
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,300
See?
That's great, luke.

509
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,100
You thought
she was avoiding you.

510
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Yeah.

511
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,300
Well...

512
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,500
I'll see you.

513
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,100
Hey, what do you mean

514
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,000
You don't know
if you won or not tonight?

515
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,200
I meant i don't know
if the team won.

516
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,700
But i lost.
I know that for sure.

517
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,700
So, am i allowed to ask what'sgoin

518
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,600
????

519
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,000
There's really not much to say,
you know?

520
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,700
It's not the easiest thing in
the world for him to talk about.

521
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,600
Well, you know what works?
Get him drunk.

522
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,700
Oh, says the 18-Year-Old.

523
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,500
I'm just saying.
You know how it is --

524
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Guys always tell the truth
when they're wasted.

525
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,500
Says the 18-Year-Old.

526
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,900
Jamie: how come uncle lucas
was so mad, mama?

527
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,700
The ravens won the game.

528
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,600
I don't know, jim-Bob.
Uncle lucas won't call me back.

529
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,500
Hey, look,
there's grandpa.

530
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,900
I have an idea.

531
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,500
Why don't you go give your card
to your grandpa?

532
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,000
???

533
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,500
You're my best friend.

534
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,900
Thank you.

535
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,700
Go see your pop, okay?

536
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,000
Thank you, haley.

537
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,500
That wasn't for you.
That was for him.

538
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,900
It's a big story, bill.
We could lead with this.

539
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,300
Yeah. Marvin.

540
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,000
Tell me you got
some great footage
of lucas scott
grabbing that kid.

541
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,100
I, uh --

542
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,800
I didn't get it.

543
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,800
I'm sorry.

544
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,600
I'm sorry, too.

545
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,000
I told you he wasn't ready.

546
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,200
Hey. Are you sure
you don't want me to stay?

547
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,800
I want to surprise you.

548
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,100
Des, this wa
in the morning,

549
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,400
It'll be like the cover-Song
elves were here.

550
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,800
Okay, but just call
if you need anything, okay?

551
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,500
Yeah.

552
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,800
Mia?

553
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,600

00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
Thank you.

558
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,300

559
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,900
For my life. I love it.

560
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,700
Mia, your songs
were always great.

561
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,500
You were always great.

562
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,000
I just pointed people
towards the greatness.

563
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,400
Sing good, rock star.

564
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,400
Luke!

565
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:39,800

567
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,800
Come on. Come on.

569
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,900
Hey, what are you
doing here so late?

570
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,100
Hey. I'm not exactly sure,
actually.

571
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,600
I'm really happy for you,
mia -- All your success. It's just...

572
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,900
I think maybe i'm also
a little jealous.

573
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,900
Really?
Yeah.

574
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,000
That's so weird.
I'm jealous of you.

575
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,900
Yeah. It's like
i look at you and think,

576
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,200
"If, four years from now,

577
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,300
"I have this great guy
and a beautiful son

578
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,800
"And i'm about to make whama
gonna be an amazinn rd,

579
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,300
I'm gonna consider myself
really damn lucky."

580
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,900
Thank you.

581
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,800
Now i know
why i came here.

582
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,000
Okay, look for the rose.

583
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,900
Nobookert?

584
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,300
Debutanteball?

585
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,800
Antwon.

586
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,900
Oh, no.

587
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,600
Oh, yeah.

588
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,800
You said you were older.

589
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,100
Hey, you said
you was younger.

590
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,000
Well, i-I showed you...
things.

591
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,000
Yes, you did.
Mm-Mm-Mmm.

592
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,600
Okay,
this is really awkward.

593
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,700
I mean, obviously,
nothing can happen here,

594
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,900
I mean, because it can't.

595
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,600
You right.
Nothing can happen.

596
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,000
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

597
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,500
Oh, what's one night between
two consenting adults, right?

598
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,700
Oh.

599
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,700
Maybe one night
and the next morning.

600
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,100
Oh, my! Oh!

601
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,600
It's gonna be bad
for coach, isn't it?

602
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,900
Yeah.
It's already bad.

603
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,200
Hi, mama.
Everything okay?

604
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,200
Hey, buddy.

605
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,100
????
You look so handsome.

606
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,100
Hey, you.
Hi, baby.

608
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,100
Hey.

609
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,500
Hi.

610
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,500
You should get some sleep.

611
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,600
Nah, i want to be here
when she opens her eyes.

612
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,900
It's a pretty great feeling,
isn't it?

613
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,100
It's why
i became a surgeon.

614
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
Why is that?

615
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,800
To give people
their lives back.

616
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,200
She'll recover and you'll send
her back to her parents, but...

617
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,900
The day she gets accepted
to college,

618
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,500
She'll have you to thank.

619
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,400
The day she gets married,
becomes something great,

620
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,300
Has children of her own,

621
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,700
She'll think,
"brooke davis got me here.

622
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,400
She gave me this."

623
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,800
And dr. Copeland, too.

624
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:27,400
It's ethan, by the way --
My first name.

625
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,900
Thank you, ethan.

626
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,900
You're welcome, brooke.

627
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,800
S right.
You are in bad shape.

628
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,700
Excuse
it's after hours.

629
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,200
Are you a relative
of reverend carter?

630
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,000
Not a relative, no.

631
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,700
But he's number one
on mst.

632
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,600
Oh, luke.

633
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,100
I'm so sorry.

634
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,200
I didn't want this
for you.

635
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,400
Peyton...

636
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,000
...i hate you.

637
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,700
What?

638
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,400
I wish you never came back.

639
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,100
You ruined my life.

640
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,300
????

641
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,000
??????
