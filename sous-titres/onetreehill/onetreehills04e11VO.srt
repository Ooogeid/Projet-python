1
00:00:00,082 --> 00:00:01,682
- ...Sophia Bush...
- And Hilarie Burton.

2
00:00:01,684 --> 00:00:03,836
And we wanna wish you guys
a very happy New Year,

3
00:00:03,846 --> 00:00:05,885
and thank you for
supporting One Tree Hill.

4
00:00:05,895 --> 00:00:07,340
It's been a great season,
so far,

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,782
and we have some amazing new
episodes coming your way,

6
00:00:09,792 --> 00:00:10,891
so don't go anywhere.

7
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:13,664
It's all starting right
here next on the CW.

8
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:17,901
Have you noticed that Lucas has
really weird stuff in his room?

9
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:18,820
Yeah.

10
00:00:18,838 --> 00:00:21,970
I mean,
who do you think give him this?

11
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,165
Oh, I'd say Brooke.

12
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:24,697
No, I'd say Peyton.

13
00:00:24,709 --> 00:00:25,906
Really?

14
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,002
Here we go again.

15
00:00:30,336 --> 00:00:31,751
Previously on "One
Tree Hill"...

16
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,413
Lose that game.

17
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:36,843
Nathan Scott drives
to the hoop!

18
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:39,410
He passes to Lucas
for a 3 and the win!

19
00:00:41,557 --> 00:00:44,440
The Tree Hill Ravens
are champions at last!

20
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,690
Nathan, look out!

21
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:49,772
Haley!

22
00:00:51,438 --> 00:00:52,930
Son of a bitch!

23
00:00:55,008 --> 00:00:57,301
Nathan! He's dead.

24
00:00:57,315 --> 00:00:58,581
Go!

25
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:01,552
She's been hit by a car.
You got to help her.

26
00:01:01,565 --> 00:01:02,940
How long has she been pregnant?

27
00:01:02,987 --> 00:01:04,403
I didn't take my pills.

28
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:05,882
You just had a heart attack.

29
00:01:05,896 --> 00:01:07,962
- I'm dead?
- Not yet.

30
00:01:08,065 --> 00:01:09,400
I'm dead.

31
00:01:09,535 --> 00:01:11,361
You are no longer my brother.

32
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:15,323
I still don't believe that
Jimmy killed you, Keith.

33
00:01:15,335 --> 00:01:17,480
We got to talk about what
happened here, Lucas.

34
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:19,361
There are things
you need to know.

35
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,450
Have you ever had a dream
that seemed so real,

36
00:01:26,526 --> 00:01:29,333
when you woke up you didn't
know what to believe?

37
00:01:34,466 --> 00:01:38,230
What would you do if what
you thought was true wasn't?

38
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:44,012
And what you thought
wasn't true was?

39
00:01:54,185 --> 00:01:55,271
Lucas.

40
00:01:55,846 --> 00:01:57,343
Luke, what are you doing here?

41
00:01:57,356 --> 00:01:59,402
I-I go here. Remember?

42
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,422
Yeah, I also remember
you had a heart attack.

43
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:04,033
The doctor said it was okay if
I did some light activities.

44
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:08,281
I won't be training for a
marathon anytime soon, but...

45
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:11,900
I can still come to class and
daydream about my new girlfriend.

46
00:02:12,727 --> 00:02:15,022
Well, what happens
in that daydream?

47
00:02:15,038 --> 00:02:18,511
I slowly but very gently
take her in my arms,

48
00:02:18,528 --> 00:02:21,453
and I bring her in
real close like this.

49
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:29,100
Wow.

50
00:02:29,697 --> 00:02:32,572
Last time we kissed,
it was so damn good, I collapsed.

51
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:34,983
I'm joking.

52
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:36,400
Yeah.

53
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,141
What's wrong?

54
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:43,871
- Oh.
- Yeah.

55
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:47,731
Um... you just want
to walk me to class?

56
00:02:47,748 --> 00:02:48,763
Yeah.

57
00:02:51,188 --> 00:02:52,932
For someone who just
had a heart attack,

58
00:02:52,945 --> 00:02:55,830
Lucas doesn't seem to be worried
about getting his heart rate up.

59
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,670
Questions? Comments?

60
00:02:57,685 --> 00:03:00,410
As a matter of fact,
I'm thinking about not speaking to you.

61
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:02,150
Why, because I did you a favor?

62
00:03:02,165 --> 00:03:04,170
Stealing a key to the tutor
center so I can break in

63
00:03:04,207 --> 00:03:07,471
and pilfer test answers is not a favor.
It's more like a betrayal.

64
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:11,471
Okay. We both know you suck at math,
but how do you figure?

65
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,603
Well, I convinced
Haley to tutor you,

66
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:15,740
even though she's not
exactly your number-one fan.

67
00:03:15,758 --> 00:03:19,361
So me trusting you plus you
using Haley equals betrayal.

68
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:20,693
That's one way to look at it.

69
00:03:20,707 --> 00:03:23,471
The way I see it is I suffered
through tutoring I didn't need

70
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:25,623
to steal a key for you.
Sounds like a favor to me.

71
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:26,930
Sounds dumb to me.

72
00:03:26,948 --> 00:03:28,390
Not as dumb as flunking.

73
00:03:28,405 --> 00:03:30,040
I'm not flunking anything.

74
00:03:30,055 --> 00:03:32,463
I stayed up all night
studying for this quiz.

75
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:35,411
Now that you mention it,
you do look kind of bad today.

76
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:36,472
Lipstick?

77
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:39,710
Just return they key to Haley, okay?
I don't need it.

78
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:42,570
I have never studied so hard
for something in my life.

79
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:45,123
Fine, but you better start
making friends with the juniors

80
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:46,711
cause that's who you're gonna
be hanging out with next year.

81
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:47,721
Shut up.

82
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:49,063
Mouth?

83
00:03:49,705 --> 00:03:51,792
Hey, Gigi. How's my girl?

84
00:03:51,807 --> 00:03:53,490
I'm gonna break up with you.

85
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,591
Did you just break up with me?

86
00:03:56,606 --> 00:03:59,150
No, not yet, but I'm going to.

87
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:01,160
Just thought you should know.

88
00:04:04,607 --> 00:04:07,730
You okay? You look like
you're a million miles away.

89
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,723
I didn't even know his name.

90
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:12,942
Who?

91
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:17,212
That poor man who hit me.

92
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:20,400
That poor man?

93
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,753
Haley, you were the victim.
He ran you over.

94
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:28,463
I know, but it was an accident,
and he's dead.

95
00:04:28,487 --> 00:04:30,783
And the way that 
he was killed--

96
00:04:30,798 --> 00:04:33,990
I don't know how your father
could do something like that.

97
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:37,500
Did you even know who he was?

98
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:39,220
No.

99
00:04:39,908 --> 00:04:43,561
No, you--
you were the only thing on my mind.

100
00:04:47,477 --> 00:04:50,002
Listen, I should get going.
I'm gonna be late for school.

101
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:52,421
But Karen's gonna come by
later to check on you,

102
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:54,401
and I'll swing by at lunch
and bring you some soup.

103
00:04:54,436 --> 00:04:55,871
Okay.  Chicken noodle
with some extra--

104
00:04:55,905 --> 00:04:57,991
With extra noodles. I'm on it.

105
00:04:58,558 --> 00:04:59,763
Thank  you.

106
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:06,710
I don't know how you turned out
so sweet with a father like Dan.

107
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:24,170
Good news or bad news?

108
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:26,841
You're my lawyer.
Do you ever have good news?

109
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:28,852
Okay, bad news--

110
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:32,042
You're being charged with
second-degree murder.

111
00:05:32,086 --> 00:05:34,260
Your arraignment is
scheduled for tomorrow,

112
00:05:34,277 --> 00:05:36,840
at which time we'll file
a plea of not guilty.

113
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:39,281
In a few weeks, we'll go to trial,
so we need to be prepared

114
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,761
for an investigation.

115
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:42,932
I don't want an investigation.

116
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,111
It's standard procedure.

117
00:05:45,126 --> 00:05:47,720
I'm guilty.
I want to plead guilty.

118
00:05:47,736 --> 00:05:50,653
Well, I wouldn't
recommend... that.

119
00:06:40,455 --> 00:06:42,282
You're not pleading guilty.

120
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:45,541
You shouldn't be paying for
something that I did, okay?

121
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:46,782
I'm confessing.

122
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:48,213
Don't be a fool, Nathan.

123
00:06:48,227 --> 00:06:50,093
Want do you want, dad--
20 years to life?

124
00:06:50,106 --> 00:06:52,162
'Cause that's what you'll get,
and not here.

125
00:06:52,176 --> 00:06:53,791
They'll send you
to a state prison.

126
00:06:53,807 --> 00:06:55,322
When you get out,
if you get out,

127
00:06:55,336 --> 00:06:57,081
you'll be so old,
your life will be over.

128
00:06:57,096 --> 00:06:58,963
Better mine than yours.

129
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,152
Nathan, when you came to me
asking for money, I looked at you

130
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,141
and saw a kid in over his head.

131
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:08,370
But what I should have seen was a
son who needed his father's help.

132
00:07:09,267 --> 00:07:11,091
I should have given
you the money.

133
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:13,182
I could have prevented this.

134
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:15,812
No offense, dad, but so what?

135
00:07:15,827 --> 00:07:17,662
You're not guilty of murder.

136
00:07:18,628 --> 00:07:20,961
I have sins to pay for, Nathan.

137
00:07:21,955 --> 00:07:23,510
I belong here.

138
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:28,040
I don't belong here.
I'm a good person.

139
00:07:28,258 --> 00:07:31,691
So, I pop pills.
I haven't killed anybody.

140
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:37,210
Sure, maybe I, um,
started a fire once.

141
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:41,881
And I did discharge
a firearm recently,

142
00:07:41,898 --> 00:07:43,582
but it was an accident.

143
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:47,570
The bottom line is I
don't need this place.

144
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,245
Deb, I've been in your shoes.

145
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:52,407
Gucci? I don't think so.

146
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:55,606
- Denial is not your friend.
- Oh, God.

147
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:57,953
Give this program a chance,
and you just might find

148
00:07:57,967 --> 00:08:00,612
- that rehab can help you.
- Help me?

149
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,213
This place makes me
want to take pills.

150
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:06,431
All I hear around here is whine,
whine, whine, whine.

151
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,162
Don't say "whine."

152
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:11,121
- I'm an alcoholic.
- Oh, my god.

153
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:14,840
Get me out of here. God!

154
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:21,500
So, listen. There's something
that I haven't told anybody.

155
00:08:21,516 --> 00:08:23,111
Ooh, I love secrets.

156
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:27,531
When I was unconscious,
I saw Keith.

157
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:29,891
Luke, you and Nate
should really talk.

158
00:08:30,705 --> 00:08:33,351
Not in, like,
the "Sixth Sense" sort of way, but...

159
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:35,883
it felt so real.

160
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,601
Well, don't laugh, but anytime I
have a dream about my mom or Ellie,

161
00:08:39,615 --> 00:08:42,500
I like to think it's their way of
contacting me from the other side--

162
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:44,752
like dreams are
e-mails for ghosts,

163
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:46,731
and it's their way of
sending me a message.

164
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:48,050
Okay.

165
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:50,861
Well, if there's the remotest
possibility that you're right,

166
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:53,331
then what message was
Keith trying to send me?

167
00:08:53,597 --> 00:08:55,821
Well, I don't know.
What did you guys talk about?

168
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,732
You, mostly.

169
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:04,700
What-- does my breath
stink or something?

170
00:09:04,715 --> 00:09:06,472
No, you smell really good.

171
00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:07,742
Okay, then what?

172
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:11,563
I'm just not a really
big fan of PDA.

173
00:09:11,575 --> 00:09:13,420
- Since when?
- Since whenever.

174
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:15,032
It just makes me uncomfortable.

175
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:16,432
Good to know.

176
00:09:16,547 --> 00:09:19,560
So, what--
does PDA include holding hands, hugging?

177
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:21,132
Yeah, I guess so.

178
00:09:21,398 --> 00:09:23,731
Probably. I don't know.
Maybe not. I...

179
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:28,002
I have english. I should go.

180
00:09:28,865 --> 00:09:30,381
I'll see you.

181
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:37,372
What just happened?

182
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,601
Hi, Mouth. It's me-- Gigi.

183
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:52,863
I can see that.

184
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:55,282
Quick question--
what do you like better, text or I.M.?

185
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,272
For what?

186
00:09:56,287 --> 00:09:57,741
For when I break up with you.

187
00:09:57,758 --> 00:09:59,783
Gigi, I don't want you
to break up with me.

188
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:02,550
Then do you want to
break up with me?

189
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:05,892
If so, I like I.M.s.
You can even use emoticons.

190
00:10:05,907 --> 00:10:08,341
I don't want either of us to
break up with either of us.

191
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,901
But if we did?

192
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:12,390
Face-to-face.

193
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:13,863
I would want to
break up in person.

194
00:10:13,975 --> 00:10:17,113
But don't get me wrong.
I don't want to break up.

195
00:10:18,297 --> 00:10:21,890
Okay, people, clear your desks.
Get your pencils ready.

196
00:10:23,598 --> 00:10:26,172
I know you don't think you need it,
but good luck.

197
00:10:26,187 --> 00:10:30,132
Just because you want to resort
to theft instead of hard work

198
00:10:30,148 --> 00:10:31,662
doesn't mean I have to.

199
00:10:32,626 --> 00:10:34,881
Oh, look-- pink quizzes?

200
00:10:34,896 --> 00:10:37,983
Not quite. It's a flyer for
that weirdo virgin club.

201
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:43,183
That weirdo virgin club
is called "Clean Teens."

202
00:10:43,198 --> 00:10:46,640
Hi, Shelly. Still trying to save
the school one Rachel at a time?

203
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,563
We're meeting
tonight in room 104.

204
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:50,792
Be  there or be sluts.

205
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:56,943
Suit yourself,
but if you change your mind,

206
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:58,342
the door's always open.

207
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,103
Just like Rachel's legs.

208
00:11:04,257 --> 00:11:07,731
Okay, you've got 30 minutes
to complete this quiz.

209
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:11,112
When I call "time,"
I want pencils down.

210
00:11:11,908 --> 00:11:13,241
Ready?

211
00:11:13,595 --> 00:11:15,123
I sure am.

212
00:11:15,135 --> 00:11:16,410
Begin.

213
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:24,560
Mayor Scott is being held without
bail as the investigation continues.

214
00:11:24,575 --> 00:11:26,742
Chicken noodle, extra noodle.

215
00:11:26,757 --> 00:11:29,063
...allegedly beating the driver
of a hit-and-run accident

216
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:31,773
involving his son
and daughter-in-law.

217
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,143
How you feeling?

218
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:40,041
I'm thinking about reaching
out to Daunte's family.

219
00:11:40,937 --> 00:11:43,200
That's the name of
the man that hit me.

220
00:11:43,526 --> 00:11:44,961
Who told you that?

221
00:11:44,975 --> 00:11:47,013
It's been on the news all day.

222
00:11:47,388 --> 00:11:49,993
Apparently he was some
kind of bookie or gambler,

223
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:53,551
but he was somebody's child,
and now that I'm gonna be a mother--

224
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:55,271
Who are we without forgiveness,
you know?

225
00:11:55,286 --> 00:11:59,070
And now these people not only
lost the person that they loved,

226
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:03,231
but they have to live with the fact
that he almost killed a person.

227
00:12:05,288 --> 00:12:06,803
Well, two people.

228
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,052
And I just thought maybe if I could
let them know that I'm not angry,

229
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:12,592
it might ease their pain.

230
00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:16,693
It was my fault.

231
00:12:17,085 --> 00:12:18,313
What was your fault?

232
00:12:18,326 --> 00:12:21,572
The accident,
my father being sent to prison--

233
00:12:21,588 --> 00:12:24,231
everything that happened
that night was my fault.

234
00:12:24,347 --> 00:12:25,850
What are you talking about?

235
00:12:25,868 --> 00:12:27,252
I knew Daunte.

236
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:29,503
I borrowed some money from him.

237
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:32,601
Look, we couldn't pay our bills,
and my dad turned me away.

238
00:12:32,616 --> 00:12:35,130
My mom was on drugs,
and all I had to do

239
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:38,401
was shave a few points off the spread,
just win by less.

240
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:41,311
I swear to god, Haley, I thought
that it would be over after that,

241
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:44,773
but Daunte wasn't finished.

242
00:12:46,178 --> 00:12:48,510
He wanted me to lose
the state championship.

243
00:12:48,627 --> 00:12:49,891
Which you didn't do.

244
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:55,031
Hayley, listen--
I'm so sorry, okay?

245
00:12:55,046 --> 00:12:57,360
But I was scared,
and he threatened me.

246
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,470
I was trying to lose the game,
but then...

247
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:03,201
you told me that we
were gonna have a boy,

248
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,502
and I just stopped
being scared.

249
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:09,311
All that mattered to me
was you and our unborn son.

250
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:12,541
So, my accident was
just Daunte's revenge?

251
00:13:12,556 --> 00:13:14,461
Haley, I wish to God it was me.

252
00:13:14,475 --> 00:13:16,231
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.

253
00:13:20,838 --> 00:13:22,482
There's something else.

254
00:13:24,265 --> 00:13:27,702
It wasn't my dad
who beat Daunte.

255
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,633
- It was me.
- Nathan--

256
00:13:30,645 --> 00:13:33,762
Haley, I saw you lying in the street,
and I just lost my mind, okay?

257
00:13:33,776 --> 00:13:35,872
Please, you have to forgive me.

258
00:13:36,485 --> 00:13:39,813
You have no idea how hard it is
for me to see you like this.

259
00:13:41,295 --> 00:13:44,201
Not as hard as it is for
me to see you like this.

260
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:06,743
You're a lucky man, Dan Scott.

261
00:14:07,287 --> 00:14:09,703
I thought my arraignment
wasn't until tomorrow.

262
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:11,521
Your arraignment's
been cancelled.

263
00:14:11,536 --> 00:14:13,981
The coroner's report
was just released.

264
00:14:13,997 --> 00:14:17,601
Turns out that good old Daunte
wasn't beaten to death after all.

265
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:20,282
What do you mean?

266
00:14:20,296 --> 00:14:23,530
Cause of death-- internal injuries
suffered during the car crash.

267
00:14:23,548 --> 00:14:26,981
Daunte died on impact,
before a single hand was laid on him.

268
00:14:30,126 --> 00:14:32,091
You're innocent, Mr. Mayor.

269
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:34,430
How does it feel
to be a free man?

270
00:14:34,936 --> 00:14:37,330
I feel as though a weight has
been lifted off my shoulders.

271
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:39,143
I couldn't be more relieved.

272
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:42,172
I'd like to thank my lawyer
and family for their support.

273
00:14:42,188 --> 00:14:44,981
Mr. Mayor, how do you think this is
going to affect your political future?

274
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,383
Mr. Mayor,
will you run for office again?

275
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:50,352
However, while I have been
cleared of these charges,

276
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:53,102
I can't overlook the fact that
I responded to a dire situation

277
00:14:53,115 --> 00:14:54,900
in a violent matter.

278
00:14:56,005 --> 00:14:59,440
My pregnant daughter-in-law
was seriously injured,

279
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:01,793
but violence is
never the answer.

280
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:04,623
And for this reason alone,

281
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,693
if the good people of Tree Hill
feel that I should step down...

282
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:10,223
then I will resign.

283
00:15:10,237 --> 00:15:13,413
Even when I'm away in rehab,
you find a way of getting in my face.

284
00:15:13,427 --> 00:15:14,600
No more questions.

285
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:20,643
Ah, goody, my afternoon pills.

286
00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:27,312
What happened to the sheets?

287
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:31,381
- Sheets?
- The bed sheets.

288
00:15:32,795 --> 00:15:34,542
That go on the bed. 

289
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:37,871
Oh, those sheets?

290
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,142
I was wondering
the same thing--

291
00:15:41,577 --> 00:15:42,892
about the sheets.

292
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,842
Thanks for coming over, man.

293
00:15:56,858 --> 00:15:59,381
Yeah, you sounded pretty
messed up in your message.

294
00:15:59,397 --> 00:16:00,573
What's up?

295
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:04,362
I screwed up, man.
I told Haley everything...

296
00:16:04,435 --> 00:16:08,573
about shaving points and throwing
state and what I did to Daunte.

297
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:12,633
It  was me, not Dan.

298
00:16:13,326 --> 00:16:15,503
I'm the one that
attacked Daunte.

299
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:17,200
- You?
- Yeah.

300
00:16:18,788 --> 00:16:22,372
I need you to come with me, Lucas.
I think I'm gonna turn myself in.

301
00:16:23,907 --> 00:16:25,892
You haven't watched the news,
have you?

302
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:28,702
Nathan, you didn't kill Daunte.

303
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:31,280
He died in the accident
from the impact.

304
00:16:31,296 --> 00:16:33,962
Dan's out of jail.
They dropped the charges.

305
00:16:34,396 --> 00:16:36,551
- Really?
- Yeah.

306
00:16:38,678 --> 00:16:40,030
You're off the hook.

307
00:16:42,747 --> 00:16:46,102
It still doesn't change the
fact that I betrayed Haley.

308
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:48,553
You should have seen the
way she looked at me, man--

309
00:16:48,586 --> 00:16:50,830
like I'm a monster.

310
00:16:51,725 --> 00:16:53,113
Now she's gone.

311
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:55,192
Wait. What do you mean,
she's gone?

312
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:58,081
She's at your house.
Your mom came over and picked her up.

313
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:03,763
Look, I think you did
the right thing, Nate.

314
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:07,051
She's your wife.
She needed to know.

315
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:09,833
I'll talk to her.

316
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:12,943
Hey, Luke...

317
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:16,603
I'm glad you're okay, man.

318
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:21,400
I'm sorry for everything.

319
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:25,630
It's okay.

320
00:17:53,846 --> 00:17:56,303
Tell me you didn't return
the key to the tutor center.

321
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:59,342
I did, and you're welcome.

322
00:17:59,356 --> 00:18:01,423
Haley will never even find out.

323
00:18:03,276 --> 00:18:04,620
I failed.

324
00:18:04,646 --> 00:18:06,470
And you know what makes
this so much worse?

325
00:18:06,488 --> 00:18:08,383
I missed an entire
night of partying

326
00:18:08,398 --> 00:18:10,402
because I stayed up studying.

327
00:18:10,685 --> 00:18:12,793
You were right, okay?
I'm not book-smart.

328
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:15,182
I'm Brooke-smart,
and there is a big difference.

329
00:18:15,198 --> 00:18:18,380
Lucky for you,
little miss cute-but-not-so-smart,

330
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:20,932
I...

331
00:18:22,097 --> 00:18:23,881
made a copy.

332
00:19:02,196 --> 00:19:05,602
Recent polls indicate that
public support for Mayor Scott

333
00:19:05,617 --> 00:19:08,960
has actually risen since Scott
was acquitted of murder charges

334
00:19:08,975 --> 00:19:10,873
earlier this afternoon.

335
00:19:11,966 --> 00:19:14,603
It's perfect.
You buy your way out of my sins,

336
00:19:14,615 --> 00:19:16,532
and your approval
rating skyrockets.

337
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:20,421
Son, the only approval rating
I care about is yours.

338
00:19:22,158 --> 00:19:25,440
I still can't believe you went
as far as you did for me.

339
00:19:28,145 --> 00:19:30,030
I'd do it again if I had to.

340
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,421
Thanks.

341
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,200
It's good to see you
out of the orange suit,

342
00:19:35,218 --> 00:19:38,991
even if you did have to pay off the
coroner to write some false report.

343
00:19:39,218 --> 00:19:42,770
But, uh,
we both know what I did.

344
00:19:42,887 --> 00:19:45,450
Listen to me, Nathan--
I didn't rig that report,

345
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:47,091
and you didn't kill Daunte.

346
00:19:47,105 --> 00:19:49,971
If you believe one thing out of my mouth--
one thing for the rest of your life--

347
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:54,262
you believe this-- you were not
responsible for taking that man's life.

348
00:19:55,006 --> 00:19:58,713
Trust me-- that's not the kind of
guilt you want to carry around.

349
00:20:04,186 --> 00:20:05,440
Hey, roomie.

350
00:20:06,986 --> 00:20:08,663
So, I talked to Nathan.

351
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,070
How you doing?

352
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:15,460
Couldn't he have just
been honest with me?

353
00:20:16,655 --> 00:20:18,972
My guess is he didn't
want to let you down.

354
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:20,821
Well, look how great
that turned out.

355
00:20:20,835 --> 00:20:24,231
Haley, Nathan would
do anything for you.

356
00:20:24,645 --> 00:20:26,502
You know that, don't you?

357
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:30,800
He made bad choices,
but he made them for you.

358
00:20:30,815 --> 00:20:32,180
Bad choices?

359
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:35,773
Luke, a bad choice is,
like, acid-wash jeans.

360
00:20:35,787 --> 00:20:39,931
Getting involved with a loan shark is a
life-threatening, really
stupid decision.

361
00:20:40,788 --> 00:20:42,693
Look at me, Luke.

362
00:20:43,747 --> 00:20:46,021
I'm a mess. I'm hurt.

363
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:48,690
He was lying to me
the entire time.

364
00:20:50,045 --> 00:20:51,881
Daunte was a bad guy.

365
00:20:53,025 --> 00:20:54,812
He tried to kill Nathan,

366
00:20:54,826 --> 00:20:57,131
and he almost killed you.

367
00:20:57,538 --> 00:20:59,771
But Nathan did
what he thought...

368
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,332
was best at the time.

369
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,853
But he didn't kill him.

370
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:08,203
I know.

371
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,850
I've been watching
the news all day.

372
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:15,002
You know, this morning I
actually felt sorry for Daunte.

373
00:21:17,555 --> 00:21:21,002
Why is it that it's so much
easier to forgive a stranger

374
00:21:21,016 --> 00:21:23,252
than it is to forgive
someone you love?

375
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:38,773
I got your evite.

376
00:21:38,787 --> 00:21:40,602
I was hoping you would come.

377
00:21:41,178 --> 00:21:44,140
How could I pass up an
invitation to my own breakup?

378
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:47,122
Look, Mouth.

379
00:21:47,247 --> 00:21:49,831
I like you a lot.

380
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:55,812
The thing is, I'm a sophomore,
and you're a senior.

381
00:21:56,077 --> 00:21:58,962
Soon you'll be going
off to college, and...

382
00:21:59,428 --> 00:22:02,470
I need to starting hanging
out with kids my own age.

383
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,060
That all makes sense,
Gigi, but...

384
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:07,620
I still don't see why we
need to break up. I mean...

385
00:22:08,297 --> 00:22:10,852
can't we at least wait
until the end of the year?

386
00:22:10,868 --> 00:22:14,940
No, because every day
for the next few months,

387
00:22:14,986 --> 00:22:16,920
I'll know this will end.

388
00:22:17,506 --> 00:22:19,292
I can't do that, Mouth. 

389
00:22:20,808 --> 00:22:22,140
I'm sorry.

390
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:32,340
You, my friend,
are going to have the hottest cast

391
00:22:32,358 --> 00:22:34,982
of all of the injured
people in Tree Hill.

392
00:22:34,997 --> 00:22:36,380
Thanks.

393
00:22:39,217 --> 00:22:40,900
Hales, you okay?

394
00:22:41,008 --> 00:22:43,661
Yeah, fine. I just, um...

395
00:22:45,328 --> 00:22:47,541
I don't want to talk
about me right now.

396
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:50,132
How  are things with
you and Lucas?

397
00:22:50,146 --> 00:22:51,641
Really good.

398
00:22:53,185 --> 00:22:54,571
Not so good.

399
00:22:54,686 --> 00:22:56,553
Lately I've kind of
been ducking him.

400
00:22:56,565 --> 00:22:59,280
Why? You guys are in,
like, that honeymoon phase.

401
00:22:59,307 --> 00:23:02,382
You should be having make-out
sessions and long talks about when

402
00:23:02,397 --> 00:23:04,420
you first knew you wanted
to be with each other.

403
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:08,952
I've been holding in my feelings
because I'm in love with him.

404
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:10,842
Which makes no
sense whatsoever.

405
00:23:10,855 --> 00:23:12,743
Well, it does to me.

406
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:16,613
The last time Lucas and I kissed--
like, really kissed--

407
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:19,851
he had a heart attack,
and he almost died.

408
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:21,600
I'm bad luck.

409
00:23:21,615 --> 00:23:22,961
Oh, shut up. You are not.

410
00:23:22,978 --> 00:23:24,191
Yeah, I am.

411
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:26,402
Think about every person
I've gotten close to--

412
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:30,123
my mom, Jake, Ellie, Derek.

413
00:23:30,136 --> 00:23:31,732
Where are they all now?

414
00:23:33,637 --> 00:23:36,372
Even my dad works a
thousand miles away.

415
00:23:37,777 --> 00:23:41,332
Peyton, there's one thing that you're
not considering in all of this.

416
00:23:41,347 --> 00:23:42,633
What's that?

417
00:23:43,115 --> 00:23:45,373
None of those people are Lucas.

418
00:23:53,827 --> 00:23:57,691
I am so rocking this cat suit.
I could totally be a thief.

419
00:23:57,706 --> 00:23:59,980
Good, because a lot of kids
who flunk out of school

420
00:23:59,997 --> 00:24:01,830
- end up working as thieves.
- Shut up.

421
00:24:02,228 --> 00:24:05,602
Okay, guys, we need two new
volunteers for movie night.

422
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:09,513
And anyone with suggestions
other than "Forrest Hump"...

423
00:24:10,176 --> 00:24:11,833
...please tell Alexa.

424
00:24:13,256 --> 00:24:16,230
Little late for a "Clean Teen" meeting,
don't you think?

425
00:24:16,298 --> 00:24:18,512
What else do virgins
have to do at night?

426
00:25:01,596 --> 00:25:02,513
Deb?

427
00:25:06,968 --> 00:25:11,113
Look, I'm sorry.
This place just isn't for me.

428
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:14,923
Well, you do know it's
a voluntary program?

429
00:25:14,938 --> 00:25:18,581
All you have to do is sign out.

430
00:25:19,005 --> 00:25:21,361
Yeah, I knew that.

431
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:38,250
Hurry up!

432
00:25:38,265 --> 00:25:40,460
I am going as fast as I can.

433
00:25:44,915 --> 00:25:46,761
Got it. Let's get out of here.

434
00:25:48,908 --> 00:25:51,002
This thing doesn't
have any pockets.

435
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:53,530
I told you we should
have worn cargo pants.

436
00:25:53,607 --> 00:25:56,582
Well, whoever designed this has no
concept of functional thief wear.

437
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,352
Maybe you should design a line
of clothing for criminals.

438
00:26:07,555 --> 00:26:10,671
Well, well,
what do we have here?

439
00:26:20,895 --> 00:26:22,171
Girls?

440
00:26:22,188 --> 00:26:25,013
Principal Turner, hi.

441
00:26:25,425 --> 00:26:27,711
What brings you two
to school so late?

442
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:33,090
Um... you know,
we just stopped by for the, uh...

443
00:26:33,186 --> 00:26:34,501
"Clean Teen" meeting.

444
00:26:34,517 --> 00:26:37,983
Clean Teens,
please welcome our two newest members--

445
00:26:37,995 --> 00:26:40,430
Brooke Davis and Rachel Gatina.

446
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:44,932
Brooke, Rachel,

447
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,862
I'd like to present each
of you with a gift.

448
00:26:51,255 --> 00:26:53,891
Brooke Davis, Rachel Gatina,

449
00:26:53,907 --> 00:26:56,182
do you promise to
treasure and protect

450
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,981
the sacredness of your virginity
now and forever?

451
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:03,572
Forever?

452
00:27:03,678 --> 00:27:05,702
Or at least until marriage?

453
00:27:05,946 --> 00:27:08,683
And do you promise to uphold
the values of "Clean Teens,"

454
00:27:08,698 --> 00:27:10,831
to stay strong in the
face of temptation,

455
00:27:10,848 --> 00:27:15,590
and to keep man parts out
of your lady business?

456
00:27:19,985 --> 00:27:22,093
Can we still Brooke ourselves?

457
00:27:22,105 --> 00:27:24,110
Oh, yeah,
that's totally allowed.

458
00:27:26,816 --> 00:27:29,850
Then... I do.

459
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,381
Brooke?

460
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:36,592
Just one second.

461
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:39,313
We have got to get out of here.

462
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,500
Yeah, sure,

463
00:27:40,517 --> 00:27:42,511
let's just pretend that principal
Turner didn't see us in the hallway

464
00:27:42,548 --> 00:27:43,760
dressed like burglars.

465
00:27:43,777 --> 00:27:46,400
Maybe he won't notice when
you get an "A" in calculus.

466
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:48,040
This is our alibi.

467
00:27:48,637 --> 00:27:51,972
We need to lay low.
Besides, these bitches are crazy.

468
00:27:51,987 --> 00:27:53,181
It might be fun.

469
00:27:54,857 --> 00:27:56,072
Fine.

470
00:27:58,057 --> 00:28:00,260
Yeah, whatever, I'm in.

471
00:28:00,758 --> 00:28:02,863
Congratulations, ladies.

472
00:28:02,966 --> 00:28:06,821
I now pronounce you
virgins for life.

473
00:28:12,737 --> 00:28:15,052
You still look like a slut.

474
00:28:15,066 --> 00:28:17,243
You still smell like a whore.

475
00:28:17,357 --> 00:28:19,353
Oh, I almost forgot.

476
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,580
Brooke, Rachel,

477
00:28:26,598 --> 00:28:28,242
welcome to "Clean Teens."

478
00:28:31,488 --> 00:28:33,003
Ooh! Hugs!

479
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:36,663
Put them on.

480
00:28:41,276 --> 00:28:42,872
This is crazy.

481
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,573
I don't want to break up with Gigi.
We're good together.

482
00:28:45,586 --> 00:28:47,611
I mean,
who cares if I'm going to college?

483
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:51,532
People have long-distance
relationships all the time. Right?

484
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:55,122
I think if your heart's telling you to
make it work, then you got to make
it work.

485
00:28:55,156 --> 00:28:57,122
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
pay no attention to the man

486
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:59,053
who's never been in a
long-distance relationship.

487
00:28:59,087 --> 00:29:01,071
Trust me-- distance is tricky.

488
00:29:01,086 --> 00:29:02,563
What's so tricky about it?

489
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:03,692
Out of sight, out of mind.

490
00:29:03,707 --> 00:29:05,150
Absence makes the
heart grow fonder.

491
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:07,863
Physical separation leads
to emotional separation.

492
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:09,620
Yeah, and technology
closes that gap.

493
00:29:09,635 --> 00:29:11,711
Guys, guys, this isn't helping.

494
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:18,433
I'm just gonna have to figure
this one out on my own.

495
00:29:19,475 --> 00:29:22,122
Hey, Mouth,
do you remember when you asked me

496
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,532
if we'd have been better off
if we never left the river court?

497
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:26,973
- Yeah. What about it?
- You still think that?

498
00:29:28,325 --> 00:29:30,821
I think it would have
been better for Jimmy.

499
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:32,873
Do you think about him much?

500
00:29:33,847 --> 00:29:35,253
All the time.

501
00:29:35,727 --> 00:29:36,933
You?

502
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:40,512
Lately, yeah.

503
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:51,961
Haley?

504
00:29:58,877 --> 00:30:00,961
Mom, what are you
doing out of rehab?

505
00:30:00,978 --> 00:30:04,472
Exactly what it looks like,
and I'm not proud of myself.

506
00:30:07,076 --> 00:30:09,320
You're not gonna find
anything in there.

507
00:30:10,528 --> 00:30:12,623
You're right. I'm sorry.

508
00:30:12,638 --> 00:30:15,260
I'm a disappointment
to you, Nathan.

509
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:18,352
I shouldn't let you
see me like this.

510
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:19,673
Mom...

511
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:24,802
...Haley left me.

512
00:30:26,988 --> 00:30:29,042
Oh, God.

513
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:33,061
Uh, I'm the last person who
should be giving advice.

514
00:30:33,076 --> 00:30:35,951
But even in my
drugged-up stupor,

515
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:39,383
I can see that what you and
Haley have is worth fighting for.

516
00:30:50,105 --> 00:30:51,253
You busy?

517
00:30:52,256 --> 00:30:54,303
No, just faking it.

518
00:30:54,955 --> 00:30:57,660
Sorry I was being
a weirdo earlier.

519
00:30:58,247 --> 00:31:01,122
You mean when you didn't kiss me
on the quad, or when you said,

520
00:31:01,138 --> 00:31:03,530
"dreams are e-mail for ghosts"?

521
00:31:05,087 --> 00:31:06,301
Both?

522
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:08,792
What's wrong, Peyton?

523
00:31:10,505 --> 00:31:13,483
I want to kiss you, Luke. I do.

524
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,713
I just don't want to lose you.

525
00:31:15,725 --> 00:31:19,643
Hey, what makes you think
you're gonna lose me?

526
00:31:19,658 --> 00:31:22,673
Only the fact that I lose
everyone I care about.

527
00:31:22,998 --> 00:31:25,961
Anytime I open up to someone,
they walk out of my life,

528
00:31:25,975 --> 00:31:27,563
or they die.

529
00:31:27,575 --> 00:31:29,683
Or they move away or they
get shipped off to Iraq

530
00:31:29,698 --> 00:31:32,091
or they turn into frickin'
Norman Bates or--

531
00:31:39,738 --> 00:31:41,030
Not everyone.

532
00:31:42,845 --> 00:31:45,303
Look, the last time we kissed,
you had a heart attack.

533
00:31:45,318 --> 00:31:46,902
And I didn't die.

534
00:31:47,446 --> 00:31:48,803
I couldn't die.

535
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,761
Do you know why?

536
00:31:51,755 --> 00:31:53,953
Because I had to come back

537
00:31:54,036 --> 00:31:56,673
and look into those
green eyes of yours

538
00:31:57,628 --> 00:31:59,310
and tell you I love you.

539
00:32:00,515 --> 00:32:02,011
I do.

540
00:32:02,585 --> 00:32:04,300
I love you, Peyton.

541
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,062
You didn't push me away.

542
00:32:09,807 --> 00:32:11,353
I came back for you.

543
00:32:11,857 --> 00:32:15,442
No matter how long it takes,
I'll wait for you.

544
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:26,771
Nathan.

545
00:32:26,788 --> 00:32:28,543
I need to see my wife.

546
00:32:30,928 --> 00:32:34,261
Haley, we can't be apart like this.
We need to be together.

547
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:38,751
Always and forever.

548
00:32:48,608 --> 00:32:50,703
I'll leave the
two of you alone.

549
00:32:57,955 --> 00:32:59,792
I'm sorry, okay?

550
00:32:59,806 --> 00:33:02,001
I never wanted to hurt you,

551
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:04,492
and I'm sorry for all
the ways that I did.

552
00:33:04,507 --> 00:33:07,362
I know you're sorry.
I know you don't want to hurt me.

553
00:33:08,318 --> 00:33:11,212
But I need to know that you're
gonna be honest with me.

554
00:33:11,228 --> 00:33:11,910
I promise--

555
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:14,222
I need to know that you're
gonna let me in, Nathan--

556
00:33:14,238 --> 00:33:16,350
I mean, all the way.

557
00:33:18,007 --> 00:33:19,430
I will.

558
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:23,251
Okay, I'll let you in. If that's
what it takes, I'll let you in.

559
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:27,832
It's just sometimes I'm
afraid that if I do,

560
00:33:27,846 --> 00:33:31,660
you'll see the real me,
the guy I was before you.

561
00:33:31,895 --> 00:33:34,962
I'm not proud of that person,
the one that I used to be.

562
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:39,301
But if I have to be that
guy to keep you safe,

563
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,493
then that's who I'm gonna be.

564
00:33:43,797 --> 00:33:46,612
Look, if you want me to
apologize for defending you

565
00:33:46,678 --> 00:33:50,071
or for fighting back when somebody
hurts you, then I can't do that.

566
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:52,481
I won't do that, okay?
Because the truth is

567
00:33:52,496 --> 00:33:54,392
that's a guy I'll never be--

568
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:58,092
a guy that just stands by and
watches while the world hurts you.

569
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:01,421
Can you understand that?

570
00:34:03,225 --> 00:34:05,322
- I can't.
- Haley, you have to.

571
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:08,231
No, I can't keep
standing on one foot.

572
00:34:08,585 --> 00:34:11,031
So if there's more,
I should sit down.

573
00:34:11,046 --> 00:34:14,093
But if you're done,
then just take me home

574
00:34:14,107 --> 00:34:16,521
'cause I'm tired and I
miss you and I love you,

575
00:34:16,535 --> 00:34:18,111
every version of you.

576
00:34:41,645 --> 00:34:42,753
Dan?

577
00:34:48,758 --> 00:34:50,990
What is wrong with people,

578
00:34:51,627 --> 00:34:54,322
to come into your
house and do this?

579
00:34:59,005 --> 00:35:01,950
They must have done it before they
knew your charges were dropped.

580
00:35:02,255 --> 00:35:06,193
I assure you, Karen, I had absolutely
nothing to do with my release.

581
00:35:07,575 --> 00:35:09,271
It was Nathan, wasn't it?

582
00:35:14,618 --> 00:35:15,912
I saw his hand.

583
00:35:15,927 --> 00:35:17,581
Daunte was already dead, Karen.

584
00:35:17,595 --> 00:35:19,600
Yeah, but you didn't
know that then.

585
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,902
And you still took the blame.

586
00:35:21,918 --> 00:35:23,463
I had to protect my son.

587
00:35:23,477 --> 00:35:25,053
I had no choice.

588
00:35:25,495 --> 00:35:28,162
You're a mother, Karen.
You would have done the same thing.

589
00:35:34,897 --> 00:35:36,331
What's this for?

590
00:35:42,928 --> 00:35:45,492
I thought I saw
someone I used to know.

591
00:35:53,095 --> 00:35:54,601
I took your advice.

592
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:56,883
I told Peyton how I felt.

593
00:35:57,838 --> 00:35:59,741
I got to tell you something.

594
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:02,213
You were right.

595
00:36:02,756 --> 00:36:04,783
It felt good to tell her.

596
00:36:24,658 --> 00:36:25,962
Thanks, Keith.

597
00:36:27,927 --> 00:36:30,733
Have you ever had a dream
that seemed so real,

598
00:36:30,748 --> 00:36:33,550
when you woke up you didn't
know what to believe?

599
00:36:45,608 --> 00:36:49,701
What would you do if what
you thought was true wasn't?

600
00:36:57,136 --> 00:37:00,730
And what you thought
wasn't true was?

601
00:37:03,285 --> 00:37:05,681
Thank you for
telling the truth.

602
00:37:06,146 --> 00:37:08,990
Now I know why they
call it true love.

603
00:37:14,595 --> 00:37:16,822
Would you retreat into
your dreams with the hope

604
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:18,841
of finding a more
perfect reality?

605
00:37:18,855 --> 00:37:21,681
We can make this work.
I'll come home on weekends.

606
00:37:21,696 --> 00:37:23,490
We'll talk on the phone.

607
00:37:23,516 --> 00:37:26,593
Gigi, we can make this work.
I'll come home on the weekends...

608
00:37:41,115 --> 00:37:42,690
Look at it this way--

609
00:37:42,705 --> 00:37:44,822
yesterday you were
a slut with an "F."

610
00:37:44,837 --> 00:37:48,200
Today you have an "A" in math
and your virginity back.

611
00:37:48,217 --> 00:37:49,672
- You should be psyched.
- Yeah.

612
00:37:51,087 --> 00:37:52,680
Brooke, Rachel!

613
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:54,002
Over here!

614
00:38:01,585 --> 00:38:05,471
Sometimes life is
stranger than a dream.

615
00:38:11,736 --> 00:38:13,722
And the only way to wake up

616
00:38:15,265 --> 00:38:18,270
is to face what 
lies hidden in your soul

617
00:38:25,207 --> 00:38:28,123
I still don't believe that
Jimmy killed you, Keith.

618
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:30,312
Then why do you?

619
00:38:30,327 --> 00:38:32,620
Jimmy Edwards was
your friend, Luke.

620
00:38:32,637 --> 00:38:35,300
You knew him.
You were kind to him.

621
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:40,161
After everything we've seen don't you
think that that kindness had an impact?

622
00:38:40,177 --> 00:38:42,460
If it did,
then you would still be alive.

623
00:38:42,478 --> 00:38:44,380
Do you really
believe that, Luke?

624
00:38:44,398 --> 00:38:47,160
Look into your heart, okay?

625
00:38:47,176 --> 00:38:50,001
It may be flawed physically,
but it's a good one,

626
00:38:50,017 --> 00:38:52,293
and it's what makes you you.

627
00:38:52,305 --> 00:38:55,911
Luke, you've changed other
people's lives by opening it up.

628
00:38:55,928 --> 00:38:58,222
Don't close that off.

629
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:03,893
And you can only hope that in
those moments of dark reflection...

630
00:39:08,588 --> 00:39:10,563
...that you are not alone.

631
00:39:16,618 --> 00:39:19,761
Hey. I've been waiting for you.

632
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:22,352
I think we've
waited long enough.

633
