1
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:08,037
You are heading down
a dangerous path.

2
00:00:08,705 --> 00:00:09,838
You don't have a job --

3
00:00:09,906 --> 00:00:10,806
Victoria:
Your honor...

4
00:00:10,874 --> 00:00:12,007
She does have a job.

5
00:00:12,074 --> 00:00:14,275
She works for me.

6
00:00:14,343 --> 00:00:15,910
How did we get the funding
for the movie?

7
00:00:15,978 --> 00:00:17,611
My father and I
put up the money,

8
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:19,279
Because I believe in you.

9
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:20,547
The movie shoots
in a week,

10
00:00:20,615 --> 00:00:22,169
And we don't have
a costume designer,

11
00:00:22,236 --> 00:00:24,319
Which is why
I'm asking you now.

12
00:00:24,387 --> 00:00:25,524
We just broke up.

13
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:27,160
I want to direct.

14
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,025
You were at the top
of the list.

15
00:00:29,092 --> 00:00:30,583
Better get to work.

16
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,425
I'm sorry I lied to you.
This is yours.

17
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:36,531
Just maybe don't give it
to taylor.

18
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:39,763
So, let's make
someone's favorite movie!

19
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,450
yeah? Let's go.

20
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,265
Okay. What?

21
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,320
David left me.

22
00:01:06,664 --> 00:01:07,974
Smart move.

23
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:16,249
You're not seriously looking
to me for sympathy, are you?

24
00:01:16,317 --> 00:01:18,066
I really liked him.

25
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:20,217
Yeah.

26
00:01:20,284 --> 00:01:22,401
And nobody's
ever left me before,

27
00:01:22,476 --> 00:01:24,523
Especially not a guy
like david.

28
00:01:24,591 --> 00:01:26,672
And what's that supposed
to mean?

29
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,861
It's not like he's a super big
catch or anything.

30
00:01:29,929 --> 00:01:34,123
Oh, look, 9 across --
"superficial bitch."

31
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,014
T-a-y-l-o-r.

32
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:37,954
Language.

33
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,380
Oh, come on.
This happens every morning.

34
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:44,093
Maybe you should get up
a little bit earlier.

35
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:45,733
And maybe you should make more
when you take the last of it.

36
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:46,844
I didn't. Quinn did.

37
00:01:46,912 --> 00:01:48,084
No, I didn't.

38
00:01:48,152 --> 00:01:49,457
Who ate all my cereal?

39
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:50,903
Quinn.
Taylor.

40
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:53,986
Sorry, buddy, taylor likes
to take things that aren't hers.

41
00:01:55,423 --> 00:01:57,497
Sweetie, we have
plenty more cereal.

42
00:01:57,565 --> 00:01:58,536
So, hales.
Huh?

43
00:01:58,604 --> 00:02:00,481
David broke up
with taylor.

44
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:03,935
I'm glad you find
my heartbreak amusing.

45
00:02:04,003 --> 00:02:06,112
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,956
You guys broke up?

47
00:02:08,023 --> 00:02:09,828
Oh, no.

48
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,910
Nathan:
Okay, come on, jamie.

49
00:02:11,977 --> 00:02:14,119
Let's go out
for breakfast.
Good idea.

50
00:02:14,187 --> 00:02:15,525
Bye, mom.
Bye.

51
00:02:15,592 --> 00:02:16,663
Quinn: Way to go, tay.

52
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:18,706
You scared off
half the family.

53
00:02:18,774 --> 00:02:21,153
No, you did with
your morning breath.

54
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:23,028
Haley: No milk?
Are you kidding me?

55
00:02:29,324 --> 00:02:31,097
Well, somebody's
trying to win

56
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:33,273
The super-assistant award
this morning.

57
00:02:33,341 --> 00:02:34,911
Morning, victoria.

58
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:37,624
Double nonfat macchiato --
should still be hot.

59
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:39,265
Aren't these pieces
amazing?

60
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,040
I've already steamed, priced,
and displayed

61
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:42,578
The rest of the shipment --
look.

62
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,457
What?

63
00:02:45,524 --> 00:02:47,231
Are you...

64
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,944
How are you feeling?

65
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:52,184
I'm fine, really.

66
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:54,659
This isn't the manic work
of drug-doer millie.

67
00:02:54,727 --> 00:02:56,901
I'm just really,
really trying

68
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,908
To prove myself
to you and brooke.

69
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:04,027
Promise me that if things
get hard,

70
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:07,308
You don't disappear
into some dark alley.

71
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:09,315
You can talk to me.

72
00:03:09,383 --> 00:03:12,159
No dark alleys for me,
I promise.

73
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:37,345
No, the advance can't be
50% applicable,

74
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:38,549
And you know this.

75
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:39,619
Come in.

76
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,325
Uh-huh.

77
00:03:41,393 --> 00:03:42,662
Well, it --
it's because it's standard

78
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,932
In these types of deals.

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,972
All right,
clay's got all the good stuff.

80
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,278
What do you want?

81
00:03:47,346 --> 00:03:50,387
Um, can I mix fruity ones
with cocoa ones?

82
00:03:50,455 --> 00:03:52,293
That's gross.
Go for it.

83
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:53,563
What's up, nate?

84
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:55,970
How you doing today, scott?
Hey, boy.

85
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:58,912
Ah, too many girls at our house,
not enough cereal.

86
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,885
All right.
Glad to see your priorities
are straight.

87
00:04:00,953 --> 00:04:03,527
Cereal first.

88
00:04:03,595 --> 00:04:05,966
Thanks.

89
00:04:06,034 --> 00:04:08,173
Whew.
I'll be outside.

90
00:04:08,242 --> 00:04:11,384
Got crazy
endorsements -- crazy.

91
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:12,653
Clay's got
all the good stuff.

92
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:14,755
Yes, he does.

93
00:04:14,823 --> 00:04:15,857
Cocoa.

94
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,895
Hey.

95
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,397
Hi.

96
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,065
How's everything going?

97
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,433
Uh, okay, I guess.

98
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:30,570
I'm struggling with the dialogue
in this scene.

99
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:32,572
It --
it doesn't feel honest.

100
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:34,841
What's the scene?

101
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:39,178
Um...

102
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:40,978
It's the one
where he leaves her.

103
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:43,513
Oh.

104
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,982
Well, I think
all girls understand

105
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:48,250
The moment
there's another girl.

106
00:04:48,318 --> 00:04:52,120
<i>So maybe it's about
what they don't say.</i>

107
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:56,557
Actually, I was thinking
he doesn't say enough, you know?

108
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,460
I mean, she's got to know
that he loved her,

109
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:02,528
But if she doesn't,

110
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:04,997
He needs to find the words
to convince her.

111
00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:07,032
And what are those words?

112
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,800
I don't know yet.

113
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:11,135
But I'm gonna find them.

114
00:05:11,203 --> 00:05:12,903
I mean...

115
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:15,305
The movie depends on it.

116
00:05:15,373 --> 00:05:17,573
Right.

117
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:22,243
Well, then,
I should get back to work.

118
00:05:29,117 --> 00:05:31,085
I know.
I mean, give me a break.

119
00:05:31,152 --> 00:05:32,251
What are you guys
doing here?

120
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,186
Uh, we are out
for breakfast.

121
00:05:34,254 --> 00:05:36,021
You're hiding
from taylor.

122
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:38,757
Hiding? No.

123
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:40,192
Yes, we ar
yeah.

124
00:05:42,328 --> 00:05:45,062
Don't answer it.

125
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,033
Really, bitches?

126
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,267
Language!

127
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:54,804
You're hiding.
I get it.

128
00:05:54,872 --> 00:05:57,341
Uh, no, we aren't.
We were just leaving.

129
00:05:57,408 --> 00:06:00,743
Whatever. I guess it'll
just be me and mom, then.

130
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:04,480
Well, well.

131
00:06:04,548 --> 00:06:05,981
Hiding from taylor?

132
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:07,316
Grandma!

133
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:09,718
Hey, handsome!
Ooh!

134
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:11,152
Mom, what are you
doing here?

135
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,789
What, I can't come to see
my three favorite daughters?

136
00:06:14,856 --> 00:06:16,390
We all know you don't
like taylor that much.

137
00:06:16,457 --> 00:06:18,191
Oh, lord,
some things never change.

138
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:19,859
Get over here. Mm.

139
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:21,327
Nathan.
How are you?

140
00:06:21,395 --> 00:06:23,228
How are you,
sweetie?
Good to see you.

141
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,434
Can we make her sexier?

142
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:32,703
I mean, not slutty,
just sexy...Er.

143
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:33,971
Yeah.

144
00:06:37,308 --> 00:06:40,810
We'll tuck this and...

145
00:06:46,082 --> 00:06:48,350
No, I like
the sleeves up.

146
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:51,353
Slutty. Um, I'm gonna
take up the hem.

147
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,588
Okay, whatever you think.
Rehearsal in 20?

148
00:06:53,656 --> 00:06:54,589
Yeah, we'll be ready.

149
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:58,860
You didn't have to do that,
with the sleeves.

150
00:06:58,928 --> 00:07:00,395
I know.

151
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:02,263
It looks better
like this.

152
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:04,363
Oh. Right.

153
00:07:06,265 --> 00:07:08,199
I need you
to pick one.

154
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:11,968
Uh, I like them both.
You decide.

155
00:07:12,036 --> 00:07:14,904
Try this one on while I fix
what you're wearing.

156
00:07:14,972 --> 00:07:18,107
Brooke, I'm sorry that you
and julian broke up.

157
00:07:19,242 --> 00:07:20,942
Okay.

158
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:24,411
Okay.
I'll try this on.

159
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:35,983
Hey, be careful.

160
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:38,052
Lydia:
Isn't it about time

161
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:39,920
For you and nathan
to have another one?

162
00:07:39,988 --> 00:07:41,721
I mean,
you're not getting any younger.

163
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:43,990
Very funny.

164
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:45,591
Neither is quinn.

165
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:48,026
Oh, thanks.

166
00:07:49,862 --> 00:07:52,864
I always thought
that you and david

167
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,765
Would have lots and lots
of babies.

168
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,366
Yeah, that's
taylor's department now.

169
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:58,400
What?

170
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:00,869
Tay and david?

171
00:08:00,937 --> 00:08:02,070
Well, not anymore.

172
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:03,471
He broke up with her
this morning.

173
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,205
Oh!

174
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:07,674
Are you okay?

175
00:08:07,741 --> 00:08:08,941
Yeah.

176
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:12,377
I'm happy,
and he's happy.

177
00:08:12,444 --> 00:08:14,945
Taylor's unhappy.
That's all that matters.

178
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:17,916
Clay's kind of cute.

179
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:19,551
Clay's amazing.

180
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:22,288
Well, that's good.

181
00:08:22,356 --> 00:08:24,389
And what about you, mom?

182
00:08:24,457 --> 00:08:26,325
You okay without daddy?

183
00:08:28,194 --> 00:08:31,362
I am today.

184
00:08:37,468 --> 00:08:38,902
You like it?

185
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,437
I'm not flower-friendly.

186
00:08:40,505 --> 00:08:42,339
Everybody likes flowers.

187
00:08:42,406 --> 00:08:45,274
I didn't say I dislike them.
I simply can't keep them alive.

188
00:08:45,342 --> 00:08:47,443
Flowers in a vase
are better.

189
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,245
They last a limited amount of
time, and no care is required.

190
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:52,013
Are you scared?

191
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,914
Of what?

192
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,551
Of being
my girlfriend.

193
00:08:57,619 --> 00:08:59,754
Look.

194
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:01,422
I'm not your girlfriend,

195
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,424
Anthe odds of that happening

196
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:06,159
Are about as good as me
keeping that orchid alive --

197
00:09:06,227 --> 00:09:07,827
Slim to none.

198
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:11,363
And let's be honest.
You're the one that's scared.

199
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:15,000
You're talented, and yet
you won't make a record.

200
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:16,501
I'd just like to know why.

201
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,337
It's too personal.

202
00:09:19,405 --> 00:09:22,006
, "it's too personal."

203
00:09:23,642 --> 00:09:25,476
Are those supposed
to wash it all away,

204
00:09:25,544 --> 00:09:27,978
The "I'll always love you"s,
the "I don't blame you"s,

205
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:29,580
The "forever"s?

206
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:31,581
Cut. Let's go again.

207
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:33,249
Julian, this is
the 14th take.

208
00:09:33,317 --> 00:09:35,017
She's not getting it.

209
00:09:35,085 --> 00:09:37,119
We're into a couple
of meal penalties.
We got to move on.

210
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:39,621
It's -- it's an important scene,
dad. She'll get it.

211
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,158
I'm so sorry. I ju --
I can't get there emotionally.

212
00:09:44,226 --> 00:09:45,660
I'm trying, but --
it's okay.

213
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:46,994
No, it's not okay.
I ck.

214
00:09:47,062 --> 00:09:49,229
No, you'll find it.
They're your words.

215
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,031
You wrote them because they mean
something to you.

216
00:09:52,098 --> 00:09:53,965
Okay, I know you
can do this.

217
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:57,001
Just --
just s the line to me.

218
00:09:57,068 --> 00:09:58,068
sure, help me.

219
00:09:58,136 --> 00:09:59,537
Clean me up.
Make me immaculate.

220
00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:02,473
Fill me up with your promises
and words and lies.

221
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,642
Okay, say it again,
but just stay with me.

222
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:06,276
Let me help you.

223
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:08,278
Mnh-mnh.

224
00:10:08,345 --> 00:10:10,846
Say the line again,
but look at me.

225
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:12,880
Look at me.

226
00:10:12,948 --> 00:10:14,916
Just stay with me.

227
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:17,486
sure, help me.

228
00:10:17,554 --> 00:10:19,554
Clean me up.

229
00:10:19,622 --> 00:10:21,223
Make me immaculate.

230
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,558
Fill me up
with your promises.

231
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:24,692
Okay, roll camera.

232
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,327
We're gonna tail-slate it.

233
00:10:27,395 --> 00:10:28,862
Again.

234
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,931
Elise, let me help you.

235
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:34,000
Sure, help me.

236
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:38,269
Clean me up.
Make me immaculate.

237
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:41,172
Fill me up with your promises
and words and lies.

238
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:43,107
Elise, please.
Tears, max?

239
00:10:43,174 --> 00:10:45,141
Are these supposed
to wash it all away,

240
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:49,445
The "il always love you"s,
the "I don't blame you"s,

241
00:10:49,513 --> 00:10:52,580
The "forever"s?

242
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:56,283
Cut.

243
00:10:56,351 --> 00:10:58,618
Check the gate.
That's perfect.

244
00:11:00,153 --> 00:11:01,186
Okay, mark.

245
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,825
Good job.

246
00:11:15,568 --> 00:11:16,801
You did it.

247
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:19,603
No, alex did it.

248
00:11:22,774 --> 00:11:23,974
Okay.

249
00:11:38,788 --> 00:11:40,755
You're feeling a bottle
of something,

250
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:43,591
<i>But you should stick
with water.</i>

251
00:11:43,658 --> 00:11:45,225
It's safer emotionally.

252
00:11:46,494 --> 00:11:48,161
You want to talk about it?

253
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:52,598
I took a job
to be near my ex.

254
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:56,068
It's painful.

255
00:11:56,136 --> 00:11:58,437
But it's worse
to be away from him.

256
00:11:58,504 --> 00:12:01,239
sorry.

257
00:12:01,307 --> 00:12:02,974
I don't mean to be
the sad, pouty girl

258
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:05,376
Who comes in,
dumps all her problems on you.

259
00:12:05,444 --> 00:12:06,877
U are talking
to a guy

260
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:09,112
Who wrote an entire album
about a girl --

261
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:10,514
Every song.

262
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:12,382
What happened?

263
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,084
She's with
someone else now.

264
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:18,153
How did you know
it was over?

265
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:19,288
You know,
for the longest time,

266
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:20,822
Whenever I would see her,

267
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,191
Even after we weren't
together amore,

268
00:12:23,258 --> 00:12:25,392
She would tell me
that she missed me.

269
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,128
Ani would look
into her eyes,

270
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:30,563
And I knew she meant it.

271
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:33,800
Then one day,
she just stopped saying it,

272
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:37,235
And I knew she was gone.

273
00:12:41,406 --> 00:12:43,807
I went in for one drink

274
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,042
And told my daughter
to stay in the car,

275
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,177
That mama
would be right back.

276
00:12:48,245 --> 00:12:50,879
Excusee. Hi.

277
00:12:50,947 --> 00:12:52,614
Would you mind signing this
reallyuick?

278
00:12:52,682 --> 00:12:54,549
It's just a court thing.

279
00:12:54,617 --> 00:12:56,117
You n't have
to explain.

280
00:12:56,185 --> 00:12:57,485
Oh.

281
00:12:57,553 --> 00:13:00,320
You know,
it might help you to stay.

282
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:03,056
It's okay. It was just
a small driving incint.

283
00:13:03,124 --> 00:13:04,524
I'm fine.

284
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:14,099
Thank you.

285
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:15,300
There you go.

286
00:13:17,703 --> 00:13:20,170
Quinn's told me a lot
about you.

287
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,006
All good, I ho.

288
00:13:23,074 --> 00:13:25,208
Mm. You make her
very, very happy.

289
00:13:25,276 --> 00:13:27,510
You knowhat worried look
she gets?

290
00:13:27,577 --> 00:13:28,844
It's gone.

291
00:13:28,912 --> 00:13:32,080
She means the world
to me.

292
00:13:34,016 --> 00:13:36,250
I was sorry to hear
about your wife.

293
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:39,887
I lost my husband, too,
a few years back.

294
00:13:39,954 --> 00:13:43,123
Quinn mentioned that.
I'm sorry, too.

295
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,325
's hard, isn't it,

296
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:48,461
Learning to live
without them?

297
00:13:49,797 --> 00:13:51,697
Yeah.

298
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,867
It's hard mang
new memories,

299
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,803
You know,
like it's not fair to them.

300
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:02,973
<i>I think it not fair
to them not to.</i>

301
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,210
I mean, they'd want that,
wouldn't they?

302
00:14:07,277 --> 00:14:11,013
They'd want to know
that we faced their absence

303
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,016
With dignity and grace.

304
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,684
Yeah, well, the truth is,

305
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:19,953
I'm not sure I've been
thatracious about any of it.

306
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:21,655
You're still here,
aren't you,

307
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:24,757
Still finding your way?

308
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:29,028
That's about as much grace
as anyone can ask.

309
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:40,595
Oh, haley,
I'm so glad you're here.

310
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:42,696
You're chipper.

311
00:14:42,764 --> 00:14:44,631
I don't think you've ever been
happy to see me.

312
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:46,999
I need you to convince grubbs
to record.

313
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:49,099
Um, I-I'm sorry.

314
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,399
My mom's in town, so I'm gonna
be spending the day with her.

315
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,300
Since when do you need my help
convincing someone

316
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:54,567
To do something
they don't want to do?

317
00:14:54,635 --> 00:14:55,769
You're great at that.

318
00:14:55,837 --> 00:14:58,177
It's true,
but this one is different.

319
00:14:58,244 --> 00:15:01,346
He called me...
His girlfriend.

320
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:03,214
That's so sweet.

321
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:04,748
It's not sweet,
and don't confuse the issue.

322
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:07,651
He's good. He's really good.
And our label could use him.

323
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:10,120
You totally
have a boyfriend.

324
00:15:10,187 --> 00:15:12,521
go get him, tiger.

325
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:16,091
He's not my boyfriend!

326
00:15:18,728 --> 00:15:20,462
Whoa, this is cool.

327
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,865
It's exactly
like uncle lucas' house.

328
00:15:23,932 --> 00:15:28,069
Hey, there's
my first a.D.

329
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:29,771
Oh, cool.

330
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,305
So, I need
some background footage

331
00:15:31,373 --> 00:15:32,773
Of the set
and behind-the-scenes stuff.

332
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:34,207
Think you can handle that?

333
00:15:37,444 --> 00:15:40,646
So, you working hard
or hardly working? "shrek 2."

334
00:15:40,714 --> 00:15:42,848
dude, that's your movie quote?

335
00:15:42,915 --> 00:15:44,783
That's, like,
a common expression.

336
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,718
Yeah?
Yeah.

337
00:15:46,785 --> 00:15:48,619
Wow, "shrek 2."

338
00:15:52,123 --> 00:15:54,524
I like "shrek 2."

339
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:59,128
Hey, bitch.

340
00:15:59,196 --> 00:16:01,263
Hey.
Oh, you're cranky.

341
00:16:01,331 --> 00:16:02,798
No, I'm not.
I'm fine.

342
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:07,268
Okay, sort of cranky that I have
to go to these meetings.

343
00:16:07,335 --> 00:16:10,503
It's a bunch of losers
with serious problems,

344
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:11,904
Like leave-your-kid-
in-the-car

345
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,973
Or burn-your-house-down-'cause
you're-so-wasted problems.

346
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,374
Mine -- not so big.

347
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:16,708
Right.

348
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:17,843
Whatever.

349
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,078
How's being
a movie star again?

350
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,347
Try worst actress ever --
14 takes this morning.

351
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,615
Not awesome.

352
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:27,284
Julian was great,
but I'm just --

353
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:29,186
I'm really frustrated.

354
00:16:29,253 --> 00:16:31,888
You'll be okay.
You're alex dupré.

355
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:33,055
Man: Alex,
they're ready for you.

356
00:16:33,123 --> 00:16:34,589
Okay, thanks.

357
00:16:34,657 --> 00:16:36,757
Yeah, well, hopefully alex dupré
figures it out

358
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:38,625
Before she brings
down the whole movie set.

359
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:40,360
Later, bitch.

360
00:16:40,427 --> 00:16:42,495
Oh, millie.

361
00:16:42,563 --> 00:16:44,096
Those people
at the meetings --

362
00:16:44,163 --> 00:16:46,231
Their problems started out
not so big, too.

363
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,877
So, I want the camera
to circle right while zooming,

364
00:16:57,945 --> 00:16:59,612
As if we're being drawn
into them.

365
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,347
Then I want
to slow the movement

366
00:17:01,415 --> 00:17:03,715
And end on a tight close-up
of alex -- no cutting.

367
00:17:03,783 --> 00:17:04,783
Got it?

368
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:05,783
Nice shot, hitchcock.

369
00:17:05,851 --> 00:17:07,618
It's "vertigo," right?

370
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:12,454
Hey, beauty.
I have the suit sample.

371
00:17:12,522 --> 00:17:14,923
gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

372
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:16,991
I die. I love it.

373
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:18,426
Yeah?

374
00:17:18,494 --> 00:17:19,894
I'd love it
with a slimmer leg,

375
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:21,463
An eighth of an inch
on either side.
Got it.

376
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,232
So, I'm thinking

377
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,166
We'll be ready to unveil
in about a month.

378
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:28,501
You are good,
alexander coyne.

379
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:29,836
<i>No, you're good,
brooke davis.</i>

380
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:31,003
Brooke, they're doing
last looks.

381
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:32,638
Okay.

382
00:17:32,706 --> 00:17:35,339
And you look hot.

383
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:37,841
Wow.

384
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:39,309
Do you, uh, need any help
with that?

385
00:17:39,377 --> 00:17:41,143
No, I'm good,
but feel free

386
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:43,779
To go make the adjustments
to that suit, now.

387
00:17:43,847 --> 00:17:47,182
Or you could just stay
and do it later.

388
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,952
Okay.

389
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:55,222
Really?

390
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:57,557
She is pretty hot.

391
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,992
Another guy
hypnotized by alex.

392
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,227
She's like
a freaking siren.

393
00:18:02,295 --> 00:18:05,329
Hey, there's no woman as
alluring as you, brooke davis.

394
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,869
I think I should
get back to work.

395
00:18:09,937 --> 00:18:11,872
Good idea. Hey.

396
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,373
I appreciate you
being around.

397
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:16,806
I know you didn't sign up
for a lot of this.

398
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:18,207
Yeah, no worries.

399
00:18:18,274 --> 00:18:20,542
I'm here
for whatever you need.

400
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,529
So, alexander's
kind of a tool, huh?

401
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,828
If by tool, you mean
really good designer.

402
00:18:41,896 --> 00:18:43,663
Yeah, tool.

403
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,533
Wow, and I was
just gonna tell you

404
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:50,502
That you did a really good job
with alex on that scene today.

405
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,037
And then I was

406
00:18:53,105 --> 00:18:56,340
Maybe gonna tell you
that you're a natural.

407
00:18:56,408 --> 00:18:57,841
I don't know if a natural

408
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:00,243
Would need 14 takes
to direct one scene.

409
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:02,712
Don't be so hard
on yourself.

410
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:05,380
Is this too hard
on you?

411
00:19:06,949 --> 00:19:08,649
I'm okay.

412
00:19:10,485 --> 00:19:12,787
Julian,
can I talk to you?

413
00:19:12,854 --> 00:19:14,688
Yeah.
I was just leaving.

414
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:20,896
I see you're driving
that truck.

415
00:19:20,963 --> 00:19:22,630
What happened
to your mercedes?

416
00:19:22,698 --> 00:19:24,566
I sold it.

417
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:26,200
To help finance the movie?

418
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:27,668
Mm-hmm.

419
00:19:28,937 --> 00:19:30,570
You shouldn't be risking
everything on this.

420
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:31,938
Look, I got to get
back to work, dad.

421
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:33,606
Then I'll get to the point.

422
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,074
Alex has to be better,

423
00:19:35,142 --> 00:19:37,643
Or we're gonna be
in serious trouble here.

424
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,212
She will be.

425
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,680
Your coffee,
sir.

426
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:42,580
Thank you.

427
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:54,290
Jamie, you bug,

428
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:56,991
You are exactly what I need
to brighten my day.

429
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:58,359
What are you doing?

430
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:00,293
Jamie: Capturing
behind-the-scenes footage.

431
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:04,430
Oh, well,
make me look fabulous.

432
00:20:04,497 --> 00:20:06,030
Hi.

433
00:20:06,098 --> 00:20:08,466
How you doing?

434
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:10,501
Well, you know, working
on the ex-boyfriend's movie

435
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:14,170
In the ex-ex boyfriend's house
is kind of weird,

436
00:20:14,238 --> 00:20:16,538
But I'm managing.

437
00:20:16,606 --> 00:20:18,307
What's going on
with the ex-boyfriend part?

438
00:20:18,374 --> 00:20:20,175
We're trying to be friends.

439
00:20:20,243 --> 00:20:22,244
And he's okay with that?

440
00:20:22,311 --> 00:20:24,345
He's fine. I'm fine.

441
00:20:24,413 --> 00:20:26,681
Everything's
gonna be fine.

442
00:20:26,749 --> 00:20:28,249
All right,
well, let me know

443
00:20:28,317 --> 00:20:30,651
If you need me to knock
some sense into the guy.

444
00:20:30,718 --> 00:20:32,452
Thanks.

445
00:20:42,027 --> 00:20:45,095
Woman: Kind of slow in here.
Oh, these are cute.

446
00:20:45,163 --> 00:20:47,031
Ah, there's this.
Can I help you find
anything?

447
00:20:47,098 --> 00:20:48,031
Oh, no,
we're just looking.

448
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:49,466
Okay.

449
00:20:49,534 --> 00:20:52,869
Hey, uh, aren't you the model
for clothes over bros?

450
00:20:52,937 --> 00:20:56,138
Yeah. Well, I was
for that campaign.

451
00:20:56,206 --> 00:20:58,909
Why are you
folding clothes?

452
00:20:58,976 --> 00:21:04,547
Oh, um...I do a lot of things
for the company.

453
00:21:07,717 --> 00:21:09,718
Well, let me know
if you need anything.

454
00:21:09,785 --> 00:21:11,986
Okay.
Thanks.

455
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:13,854
God, she looks
so plain.

456
00:21:13,922 --> 00:21:15,088
I know.

457
00:21:15,156 --> 00:21:17,390
Mm-hmm.

458
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,292
I don't know.
I think shirt.

459
00:21:26,132 --> 00:21:28,467
Hi. You got a sec?

460
00:21:28,568 --> 00:21:30,068
Yeah, of course.

461
00:21:30,136 --> 00:21:31,569
First of all,

462
00:21:31,637 --> 00:21:33,337
I, um --
I just want to thank you

463
00:21:33,405 --> 00:21:35,138
For everything
you've done for me.

464
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:36,873
It means --

465
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:39,342
Well, it means a lot.

466
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:41,009
Don't worry about it.

467
00:21:41,077 --> 00:21:42,344
What's going on?

468
00:21:42,411 --> 00:21:43,578
You sold your car.

469
00:21:43,646 --> 00:21:45,479
How much money
did you put up?

470
00:21:45,547 --> 00:21:47,915
Alex --
julian, how much?

471
00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:49,816
All of it.

472
00:21:51,118 --> 00:21:53,086
Julian,
what if I let you down?

473
00:21:53,153 --> 00:21:54,420
Then what?

474
00:21:54,488 --> 00:21:55,921
You're not
gonna let me down.

475
00:21:55,989 --> 00:21:58,056
But you put everything you had
into this movie.

476
00:21:58,124 --> 00:21:59,057
Why did you do that?

477
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,858
Man: Two minutes!

478
00:22:00,926 --> 00:22:03,794
Because you put everything
you had into this script.

479
00:22:03,861 --> 00:22:07,230
And it's good.
And you're good.

480
00:22:07,298 --> 00:22:09,798
Okay? You're not
gonna let me down.

481
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:19,840
Oh, haley.
It is such a beautiful home.

482
00:22:19,907 --> 00:22:23,075
I am so proud
of you and nathan.

483
00:22:23,143 --> 00:22:24,576
Thanks.

484
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:27,812
I feel really lucky
to have him and jamie.

485
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,580
And it's great, you know,

486
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,082
'cause all the stuff
doesn't matter so much.

487
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,652
It's just -- although
I'm really grateful to
have all the extra space

488
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:37,053
Now that quinn and taylor
are here.

489
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,255
Well, it's an important role
being your sisters' keeper.

490
00:22:39,322 --> 00:22:40,589
They're lucky to have you.

491
00:22:40,657 --> 00:22:42,591
Well, I'm glad
that you're here

492
00:22:42,658 --> 00:22:44,993
Because I don't speak taylor
fluently,

493
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,228
And I really need you
to translate.

494
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,496
Taylor has
always been rebellious.

495
00:22:49,564 --> 00:22:53,133
That girl follows her heart
without thinking twice about it.

496
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,301
Or once.

497
00:22:56,637 --> 00:23:01,273
So...What's going on, mom?
What brings you to town?

498
00:23:01,341 --> 00:23:03,375
I'm just checking in
on my babies.

499
00:23:03,443 --> 00:23:06,344
I started with the oldest,
finished with the best.

500
00:23:06,412 --> 00:23:08,279
Mm. Nobody told me
you were coming.

501
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:10,114
Well, that's because
I wouldn't let them.

502
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:12,883
I'm a big fan
of surprises.
Oh.

503
00:23:12,951 --> 00:23:14,184
Now, come on.

504
00:23:14,252 --> 00:23:16,152
Fill me in on everything
that's been going on.

505
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,920
And don't leave out
the good parts.

506
00:23:17,988 --> 00:23:19,188
Okay.

507
00:23:19,256 --> 00:23:21,890
Well, jamie's going
to a new school, and...

508
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,592
So, let me
get this straight.

509
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,627
You don't want to make a record
because it's too personal?

510
00:23:26,695 --> 00:23:28,662
That's right.
Personal sells albums.

511
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,697
Personal wins grammys.

512
00:23:30,765 --> 00:23:32,265
People can --

513
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,534
<i>Okay, well, most people
can relate to personal.</i>

514
00:23:34,602 --> 00:23:35,835
They want to hear the songs
with the words

515
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,170
That they're
too afraid to say.

516
00:23:38,238 --> 00:23:43,575
So...When you're ready --

517
00:23:43,642 --> 00:23:46,043
Ahh -- man up...

518
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,112
And make a record with me.

519
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:02,957
I can't believe this looks
exactly like uncle lucas' room.

520
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,794
Hey, remember that time
he had a mohawk?

521
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,828
Nathan: Yeah.

522
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:08,764
That was cool.

523
00:24:08,831 --> 00:24:10,934
You miss him?

524
00:24:11,002 --> 00:24:12,602
Yeah.

525
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:15,037
I miss lots of people,
I guess --

526
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:18,340
Aunt peyton
and uncle skills and quentin.

527
00:24:18,407 --> 00:24:20,775
And grandpa dan --
I miss him a lot.

528
00:24:20,843 --> 00:24:23,177
Yeah, it's hard
when you miss people.

529
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:25,645
But, you know, if you miss them,
it means you were lucky.

530
00:24:25,713 --> 00:24:27,881
It means you had
someone special in your life,

531
00:24:27,948 --> 00:24:29,615
Someone worth missing.

532
00:24:29,683 --> 00:24:31,484
Yeah, I guess.

533
00:24:31,551 --> 00:24:33,919
I just don't like
the missing part so much.

534
00:24:33,987 --> 00:24:36,888
Yeah, me neither.

535
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:42,159
Not fair. True.

536
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,761
Oh, my gosh.

537
00:24:43,828 --> 00:24:46,630
Oh, my god.
You remember this?

538
00:24:46,697 --> 00:24:49,365
This is horrible.
Oh, mom, look at my hair.

539
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:51,000
You gave me
the most awful haircut.

540
00:24:51,068 --> 00:24:53,035
It wasn't terrible.
It was cute, baby.

541
00:24:53,103 --> 00:24:54,703
Look at you,
with your little face

542
00:24:54,771 --> 00:24:56,171
And those
great big glasses.

543
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:58,740
She was teased for that haircut,
like, every day.

544
00:24:58,808 --> 00:25:00,675
Yeah, I cried
for like a week,

545
00:25:00,743 --> 00:25:02,143
And then I wore a mop head
around the house

546
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:03,278
To have princess hair.

547
00:25:03,345 --> 00:25:05,713
Haley was such a pudge.

548
00:25:05,781 --> 00:25:07,081
I was a baby.

549
00:25:07,149 --> 00:25:09,549
You're supposed to be fat
when you're -- give me that.

550
00:25:09,617 --> 00:25:11,551
Do you remember

551
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:13,820
When you used to stuff your bra,
like, a lot?

552
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,855
Mom, you have extras
of this?

553
00:25:15,922 --> 00:25:19,525
Uh, I think I have pictures
of just about all of it.

554
00:25:19,592 --> 00:25:22,560
Oh.

555
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,164
Are you okay, mom?

556
00:25:27,232 --> 00:25:29,299
Um...I'm sick.

557
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:32,268
look at me.

558
00:25:32,336 --> 00:25:34,003
I swore I wasn't gonna cry,

559
00:25:34,071 --> 00:25:36,605
But, boy,
these tears are stubborn.

560
00:25:39,242 --> 00:25:41,777
Mom, but you're gonna be
okay, though, right?

561
00:25:43,646 --> 00:25:45,980
No. I'm not.

562
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:58,489
What do you mean, mom ?
What's wrong ?

563
00:25:58,867 --> 00:26:00,534
I have cancer.

564
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:03,270
Oh, no, no, no.
It's pancreatic.

565
00:26:03,338 --> 00:26:07,971
And that means that even
with aggressive treatment,

566
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,340
I wouldn't have
much time left.

567
00:26:10,408 --> 00:26:11,774
But there has
to be options, right?

568
00:26:11,842 --> 00:26:13,175
There aren't, quinny.

569
00:26:13,243 --> 00:26:14,709
Well, you have to try.

570
00:26:14,777 --> 00:26:17,412
Okay, now, I have made
my decision.

571
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,414
And what I want to do is

572
00:26:19,481 --> 00:26:22,617
I want to live
the rest of my life fully,

573
00:26:22,685 --> 00:26:25,855
With my family,
not in some cold hospital.

574
00:26:25,923 --> 00:26:27,256
Mom, you need
to be doing

575
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:29,091
Everything that you can
right now.

576
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:31,893
Haley, I have come
to terms with this,

577
00:26:31,961 --> 00:26:34,228
And this is how
I want to do it.

578
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:41,533
You're giving up.

579
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:44,569
No, I am not giving up.
I'm gonna die.

580
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:45,604
Mom, don't say that!

581
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,372
I can't change that, okay,

582
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,475
So I've accepted it.

583
00:26:49,543 --> 00:26:51,777
How? How do you
just accept it, mom?

584
00:26:51,845 --> 00:26:53,145
You have to fight.

585
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:56,681
Because I want to enjoy
the time I have left.

586
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:59,550
Like you've been enjoying
every day since dad died?

587
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:02,752
You're giving up,
and you know it.

588
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,388
You're committing suicide.

589
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:06,822
I mean, maybe quinn
can take a picture of it,

590
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:09,291
And we can just add it
to this stupid box.

591
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:13,027
Taylor. Tay.

592
00:27:15,396 --> 00:27:17,963
Here's my wardrobe.

593
00:27:18,031 --> 00:27:19,498
Thanks.

594
00:27:19,566 --> 00:27:21,500
I -- I shortened
the dress for tomorrow.

595
00:27:21,568 --> 00:27:22,668
It'll look pretty.

596
00:27:22,736 --> 00:27:23,903
All the clothes
are really great.

597
00:27:27,406 --> 00:27:28,907
Rough day, huh?

598
00:27:28,975 --> 00:27:31,409
I've had plenty of those.

599
00:27:31,476 --> 00:27:34,244
Yeah.
Guess they're going around.

600
00:27:34,311 --> 00:27:37,881
Well, I'll see you
tomorrow.

601
00:27:37,949 --> 00:27:40,584
Alex.

602
00:27:40,652 --> 00:27:42,152
You're doing good.

603
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,155
You think?

604
00:27:46,894 --> 00:27:48,961
Thanks.

605
00:27:58,069 --> 00:28:00,136
How's my first a.D.
Doing?

606
00:28:00,204 --> 00:28:01,337
Get some good footage?

607
00:28:01,405 --> 00:28:02,471
Tons. You want to see?

608
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:04,173
Hit me.

609
00:28:04,241 --> 00:28:06,341
I got a lot
of aunt brooke.

610
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:07,742
<i>Jamie, bug,</i>

611
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,044
<i>You are exactly what I need
to brighten my day.</i>

612
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,079
<i>What are you doing?</i>

613
00:28:11,146 --> 00:28:13,381
She's pretty great.

614
00:28:13,448 --> 00:28:15,249
How about you
hang on to this,

615
00:28:15,316 --> 00:28:17,984
'cause you'll need it
next time you visit set?

616
00:28:18,052 --> 00:28:19,752
Really?
Mm-hmm.

617
00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:22,354
Sweet.

618
00:28:22,422 --> 00:28:27,124
<i>Okay, well, oh, wow.
Make me look good.</i>

619
00:28:27,192 --> 00:28:28,358
<i>Hi.</i>

620
00:28:34,601 --> 00:28:37,568
Hey, you.

621
00:28:37,636 --> 00:28:40,038
Baby?

622
00:28:40,105 --> 00:28:41,339
What's wrong?

623
00:28:44,942 --> 00:28:47,776
my mom. My mom.

624
00:28:47,844 --> 00:28:50,413
She came to tell us
that she --

625
00:28:50,481 --> 00:28:53,082
She came to tell us
that she was dying.

626
00:28:57,353 --> 00:28:58,687
I'm so sorry.

627
00:29:03,692 --> 00:29:05,659
Are you okay?

628
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:08,028
Not really, no.

629
00:29:10,731 --> 00:29:12,531
Would you like
to talk about it?

630
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:17,236
What is there to say?

631
00:29:17,303 --> 00:29:19,838
You want me to say
I'm mad?

632
00:29:19,905 --> 00:29:23,241
I'm mad.
This is not fair.

633
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,945
You say "I have cancer,"
and my whole world changes.

634
00:29:29,013 --> 00:29:31,481
What am I supposed
to do with that, mom?

635
00:29:31,548 --> 00:29:34,783
When I need advice on how to be
a good mother to jamie,

636
00:29:34,851 --> 00:29:36,118
I call you.

637
00:29:36,186 --> 00:29:38,420
When I need advice
on how to be a good wife,

638
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:40,021
I call you.

639
00:29:40,089 --> 00:29:43,556
When I'm sad or mad
or happy or whatever,

640
00:29:43,624 --> 00:29:46,225
I call you,
and I need you to be here.

641
00:29:46,293 --> 00:29:51,131
And I am always, always gonna be
a part of you, baby.

642
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:55,868
But you are a wonderful mother
and a wonderful wife

643
00:29:55,936 --> 00:29:57,336
All by yourself.

644
00:29:57,404 --> 00:29:58,470
I'm...

645
00:29:58,537 --> 00:30:01,038
Baby, you are
incredibly strong.

646
00:30:01,106 --> 00:30:03,507
Think about everything
that you have faced.

647
00:30:03,574 --> 00:30:05,209
And no matter how difficult,

648
00:30:05,276 --> 00:30:08,145
You have always found
the graceful way to handle it.

649
00:30:08,213 --> 00:30:12,349
Well, you are going to have
to find that strength now.

650
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:13,816
I don't want to.

651
00:30:13,884 --> 00:30:17,119
I don't want
to be strong for this, mom.

652
00:30:17,187 --> 00:30:18,587
I need you to be.

653
00:30:18,655 --> 00:30:21,923
And your sisters --
they need you to be.

654
00:30:21,991 --> 00:30:24,926
We...

655
00:30:24,994 --> 00:30:28,095
Are going to have
to be strong

656
00:30:28,163 --> 00:30:31,498
For everybody else
who can't be.

657
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:50,665
Mom?

658
00:30:53,536 --> 00:30:57,038
Why did you call me here?
You should be home resting.

659
00:30:58,641 --> 00:31:00,942
I'm sick, quinn.

660
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,811
I'm not a child.

661
00:31:02,878 --> 00:31:04,546
Yeah, but you've had
a long day.

662
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:08,545
It was a perfect day.

663
00:31:11,444 --> 00:31:13,679
This space...

664
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:18,282
Has your name
all over it.

665
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,717
Your photographs --

666
00:31:19,785 --> 00:31:21,552
It's time for you

667
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:24,120
To open a studio
and a gallery.

668
00:31:24,188 --> 00:31:28,890
So I've paid
the first six months' rent.

669
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:31,893
Okay, but, mom,
you know that --
no. No, no, no excuses.

670
00:31:31,961 --> 00:31:35,062
You can do this,
and you need to do this.

671
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:38,532
Your work, baby, is important,
and it's good,

672
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,001
And you need to believe
in that.

673
00:31:43,137 --> 00:31:45,471
Okay.

674
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:48,841
Okay. Thank you.

675
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:56,514
Are you scared?

676
00:32:01,285 --> 00:32:04,220
I think...

677
00:32:04,288 --> 00:32:09,457
That knowing that
your dad is there helps.

678
00:32:09,525 --> 00:32:10,959
Is he, though?

679
00:32:11,026 --> 00:32:14,261
I mean...
Does that place even exist?

680
00:32:14,329 --> 00:32:16,330
Oh.

681
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:19,266
Of course it does.

682
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:24,169
I'm just gonna miss
all of this.

683
00:32:26,774 --> 00:32:28,274
I love you.

684
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:39,617
You're gonna say
goodbye, right?

685
00:32:39,685 --> 00:32:41,285
Taylor,
you're making a mistake.

686
00:32:41,353 --> 00:32:44,354
Tay. Taylor, please.

687
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:47,156
I'm not gonna sit here
and watch her give up.

688
00:32:47,224 --> 00:32:49,124
Does everything always
have to be about you?

689
00:32:49,191 --> 00:32:51,092
Do you have to be
so selfish all the time?

690
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,793
She's the one
that's being selfish.

691
00:32:52,861 --> 00:32:55,395
Are you kidding me?
She needs us right now.

692
00:32:55,463 --> 00:32:56,964
No, what she needs
is to fight.

693
00:32:57,031 --> 00:32:58,398
And you need
to stop acting

694
00:32:58,466 --> 00:33:00,466
Like you know what's best
for everyone,

695
00:33:00,534 --> 00:33:01,767
Because you don't.

696
00:33:01,834 --> 00:33:03,868
If you leave,
you're gonna regret this.

697
00:33:03,936 --> 00:33:05,736
Maybe. Maybe I will.

698
00:33:05,804 --> 00:33:09,440
But I'm not gonna stay here
and watch her die.

699
00:33:54,976 --> 00:33:56,309
Hey.

700
00:33:56,377 --> 00:33:57,977
Hey.

701
00:34:01,048 --> 00:34:03,749
It's not supposed
to be like this, you know.

702
00:34:03,816 --> 00:34:06,851
She -- she's supposed
to watch us

703
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,353
Get married
and have kids

704
00:34:09,421 --> 00:34:11,622
And watch our kids
grow up and go to prom

705
00:34:11,689 --> 00:34:14,760
And --
and graduate high school.

706
00:34:14,828 --> 00:34:17,462
This is not --
this is not fair.

707
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,964
I know.

708
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,903
I'm really glad you're here.

709
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:27,572
me too...

710
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,540
'cause I don't think I could
handle it without you.

711
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,144
Lydia: Hey.

712
00:34:35,212 --> 00:34:36,546
Knock it off.

713
00:34:38,214 --> 00:34:41,617
Mm. All right.

714
00:34:41,684 --> 00:34:44,419
Let's have a little wine.
Where's taylor?

715
00:34:44,486 --> 00:34:46,953
Taylor is not coming.
She left.

716
00:34:47,021 --> 00:34:50,622
And I tried to get her to stay,
but she wouldn't,

717
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:53,891
Not even to say goodbye,
so I'm sorry.

718
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:56,192
It's okay.
No, it's not.

719
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,494
It's not okay,
because you need her right now,

720
00:34:58,562 --> 00:35:01,229
And we need her, and it's not
right for her to do this.

721
00:35:01,297 --> 00:35:03,597
You know what?

722
00:35:03,665 --> 00:35:05,935
Everyone...

723
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:08,910
Has to deal with this...

724
00:35:08,977 --> 00:35:13,213
In their own way.

725
00:35:13,281 --> 00:35:15,282
It'll be okay.

726
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:28,660
Millie: Marvin?

727
00:35:28,728 --> 00:35:31,796
Marvin?

728
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:40,937
I am not plain.

729
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,072
I'm fine the way I am.

730
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,175
I'm fine.

731
00:36:39,585 --> 00:36:41,085
Hi.

732
00:36:41,153 --> 00:36:44,688
Um, my name is millicent.

733
00:36:44,756 --> 00:36:47,657
And I'm new here.

734
00:36:47,725 --> 00:36:51,127
And, um...

735
00:36:51,195 --> 00:36:53,296
I don't really know what to say.

736
00:36:53,364 --> 00:36:56,732
but I keep
telling everybody I'm fine,

737
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:59,801
And --

738
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:01,836
And I'm not fine.

739
00:37:16,649 --> 00:37:19,851
Well,
you were good today.

740
00:37:19,918 --> 00:37:22,186
Good -- not great.

741
00:37:23,722 --> 00:37:26,690
I'm letting everyone dow

742
00:37:26,758 --> 00:37:29,126
Need someone to get drunk
with you?

743
00:37:29,193 --> 00:37:32,362
It's water. And I don't
get drunk when I'm sad.

744
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:37,065
I sleep with boys.

745
00:37:39,701 --> 00:37:42,436
You want to get
out of here?

746
00:37:44,405 --> 00:37:46,239
Do you really have
to think about it?

747
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:48,741
No, I was just -- I was
giving you a chance to
change your mind.

748
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:51,710
I don't do that,
either.

749
00:37:51,778 --> 00:37:54,279
Well, okay, then.

750
00:37:54,347 --> 00:37:55,980
Let's get out of here.

751
00:38:12,094 --> 00:38:13,862
How you doing?

752
00:38:18,433 --> 00:38:21,468
Taylor's gone.
She left. She...

753
00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:29,608
My mom says
I'm my sisters' keeper.

754
00:38:29,676 --> 00:38:32,410
But I couldn't
make her stay.

755
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,115
I'm not the glue.

756
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:41,951
My mom is.

757
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:46,989
When she's gone,
everything's gonna fall apart.

758
00:38:47,057 --> 00:38:48,824
Hey.
Okay, come here.

759
00:38:51,294 --> 00:38:52,994
I'm scared.

760
00:38:57,899 --> 00:39:00,133
Okay, okay.

761
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:25,353
I'm heading out.

762
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,954
You okay?

763
00:39:27,022 --> 00:39:28,589
Yeah.

764
00:39:28,656 --> 00:39:30,757
Tired.

765
00:39:30,824 --> 00:39:34,726
Well, for what it's worth,
I think you're doing great.

766
00:39:34,794 --> 00:39:37,262
Thanks.

767
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:41,298
Coming from you,
that...Means everything.

768
00:39:43,401 --> 00:39:44,701
Hey, brooke.

769
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:49,505
I miss you.

770
00:39:51,441 --> 00:39:54,576
Coming from you,
that means everything, too.

771
00:40:12,191 --> 00:40:14,325
<i>Brooke: Jamie, bug,</i>

772
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:16,959
<i>You are exactly what I need
to brighten my day.</i>

773
00:40:17,027 --> 00:40:18,261
<i>What are you doing?</i>

774
00:40:18,328 --> 00:40:21,463
All right, buddy,
it's time for bed.

775
00:40:21,531 --> 00:40:23,098
Okay.

776
00:40:23,165 --> 00:40:24,332
Mm.

777
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,900
Yeah, all right.

778
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:27,234
Hey, dad.

779
00:40:27,302 --> 00:40:29,103
Yeah?

780
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,971
I was thinking I might want
to be a director

781
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:33,407
Instead of a basketball player
when I grow up, or maybe both.

782
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:35,509
As long as you're happy.

783
00:40:38,782 --> 00:40:40,115
Is mom coming up?

784
00:40:40,183 --> 00:40:41,983
Mom is gonna spend
some time

785
00:40:42,051 --> 00:40:44,017
With her mom tonight,
all right?

786
00:40:44,085 --> 00:40:45,985
Okay.

787
00:40:46,053 --> 00:40:48,354
Night, buddy.
