1
00:00:00,048 --> 00:00:01,378
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:01,478 --> 00:00:05,600
Some reporter's asking questions about
point-shaving. That kind of thing.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,514
- You know anything about that?
- No, sir.

4
00:00:07,614 --> 00:00:10,035
How bad will it get if they
find out about you and Daunte?

5
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,652
They'll take my
scholarship for sure.

6
00:00:11,752 --> 00:00:14,064
Coach, I lied to you.
It wasn't Lucas.

7
00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:14,857
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,957 --> 00:00:15,996
So am I.

9
00:00:16,096 --> 00:00:18,520
I will accept whatever
consequences there might be.

10
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,050
I love this game.

11
00:00:20,424 --> 00:00:21,992
I'm sorry I betrayed it.

12
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:24,908
- You made a mistake.
- No. I saw you.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,642
I saw everything.

14
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:32,563
Was my uncle Keith still
alive when Jimmy shot himself?

15
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:34,812
Who killed my uncle?

16
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:36,583
It was your father...

17
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:38,483
Dan Scott.

18
00:00:53,068 --> 00:00:54,420
You son of a bitch!

19
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,530
Stop!

20
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,253
What's wrong with you?!

21
00:00:59,516 --> 00:01:00,702
- Karen, I'm --
- I'm sorry.

22
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:02,702
It shouldn't have happened --
It just did.

23
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:04,942
He killed Keith! He shot him!

24
00:01:11,146 --> 00:01:12,233
I should go.

25
00:01:16,226 --> 00:01:18,713
- Why would you say something --
- 'Cause it's the truth.

26
00:01:18,815 --> 00:01:20,093
Stop it.

27
00:01:23,508 --> 00:01:25,733
Jimmy killed Keith.

28
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:29,003
So stop it!

29
00:01:50,585 --> 00:01:53,981
Guess it was only a matter of time until
the entire town found out I'm a cheater.

30
00:01:54,088 --> 00:01:55,340
Sorry.

31
00:01:57,405 --> 00:01:58,611
You know when I was at school

32
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,873
and everybody was, like,
laughing at me after the tour

33
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,351
and whispering and
making fun of me?

34
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:05,633
I went to school one day,
and I wasn't so interesting.

35
00:02:05,738 --> 00:02:08,210
It kind of blew over.
This probably will, too.

36
00:02:08,315 --> 00:02:09,642
I hope you're right.

37
00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:11,621
How's your valedictory
speech coming?

38
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,482
Very, very slowly.
This is ridiculous.

39
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:17,793
Graduation's, like, a few days away.
I'm supposed to be finished with it.

40
00:02:17,898 --> 00:02:18,982
I'm not even close.

41
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:21,190
It'll be great.
You'll be great.

42
00:02:23,796 --> 00:02:25,261
You hear anything
from Duke yet?

43
00:02:25,365 --> 00:02:27,191
Not yet --
I'm guessing they're too busy

44
00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:29,311
trying to find another shooting
guard to fill my scholarship.

45
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:30,431
You don't know that.

46
00:02:30,535 --> 00:02:31,813
That's what I would do.

47
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:35,331
Maybe you should
talk to Whitey.

48
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:39,282
He's always been there for you.
You know, maybe he can help.

49
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,200
Do you know what today is,
P. Sawyer?

50
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:18,473
Um, shot in the dark --
yearbook day.

51
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:20,710
No. The last wednesday
of high school.

52
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:22,782
And the beginning of the end.

53
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:26,111
Do you always have to put a dark
and twisted spin on things?

54
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:28,231
My point is that
after this week,

55
00:03:28,337 --> 00:03:30,762
we actually have to figure out what
we're gonna do with our lives.

56
00:03:30,797 --> 00:03:32,190
Oh, I thought you
already did that.

57
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:34,053
Let's see.
What does the yearbook say?

58
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:37,733
"Brooke Davis -- goal:
hear an Oscar winner tell Joan Rivers,

59
00:03:37,837 --> 00:03:39,361
'I'm wearing Brooke Davis.'"

60
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:40,582
Joan Rivers?

61
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:42,281
Come on.
It was her or Ryan Seacrest.

62
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,502
- Good choice.
- Thank you.

63
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:47,333
What does the future
hold for Peyton Sawyer?

64
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,182
Let's see.

65
00:03:50,415 --> 00:03:53,280
Goal... it's blank.
How predictable.

66
00:03:53,388 --> 00:03:55,340
That's what I call ambition.

67
00:03:56,056 --> 00:04:00,090
You think maybe it's time
you just aim for something?

68
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:01,831
Well, maybe I have.

69
00:04:01,936 --> 00:04:04,883
I applied for this internship with
Sire Records a few months ago,

70
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:07,501
and I just found out I got it.

71
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:08,530
Seriously?

72
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:11,073
They need an answer
as soon as possible.

73
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:12,920
So say "yes."

74
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:14,663
It's in Los Angeles.

75
00:04:14,765 --> 00:04:17,662
Wait! We can spend the
summer together in L.A.

76
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:21,450
We can stay with my parents, and --
this is kind of perfect.

77
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:24,063
Yeah. Now I just
have to tell Lucas.

78
00:04:24,217 --> 00:04:26,411
Peyton, he's gonna
be happy for you.

79
00:04:26,536 --> 00:04:28,001
Just like I am.

80
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:37,062
Hey.

81
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:40,250
Sorry to pull you out of class,
but I need a moment of your time.

82
00:04:40,357 --> 00:04:41,741
I think I know what
this is about.

83
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:42,753
- You do?
- Yeah.

84
00:04:42,856 --> 00:04:45,133
I know I was supposed to give you
a copy of my valedictory speech.

85
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:46,720
It's just not quite
finished yet, so...

86
00:04:46,806 --> 00:04:49,861
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but you're not gonna be able to deliver

87
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:52,312
your valedictory
address this saturday.

88
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:55,112
Why? What happened?
Did somebody beat me out after finals?

89
00:04:55,216 --> 00:04:57,640
No. You finished at
the top of your class,

90
00:04:57,746 --> 00:04:59,303
and I'm very proud
of you for that.

91
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:01,552
The school board has
expressed some concerns

92
00:05:01,657 --> 00:05:03,682
in light of what's
happened recently.

93
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:09,441
- Okay, so this is about Nathan.
- Haley.

94
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:11,621
I worked really,
really hard for this.

95
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:13,482
I know you did, Haley.

96
00:05:13,776 --> 00:05:16,390
But this has become
very public.

97
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:19,211
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:32,387 --> 00:05:33,260
Can I help you?

99
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:36,573
Yeah. I'd like to
speak to a detective.

100
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:38,122
What's this regarding?

101
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:41,120
I'd like to report a murder.

102
00:05:45,415 --> 00:05:48,120

105
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:25,732
Okay.

106
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:29,052
Let me make sure
I understand this.

107
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:31,713
You're accusing the
mayor of this town,

108
00:06:31,818 --> 00:06:34,951
who also happens
to be your father,

109
00:06:35,115 --> 00:06:37,863
of killing his brother,
your uncle,

110
00:06:38,386 --> 00:06:42,110
and you're making this serious
accusation without any proof?

111
00:06:42,647 --> 00:06:45,102
I told you -- I have proof.

112
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,072
Right. The, uh,
girl who witnessed everything.

113
00:06:48,178 --> 00:06:50,550
And, uh, what was her name?

114
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:53,442
Yeah, who is this girl, Lucas?
She sounds disturbed.

115
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:54,983
Maybe if you could put
us in touch with her,

116
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:57,110
we could clear up this
horrible misunderstanding.

117
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,590
Sorry to waste your time with this,
Mr. Mayor.

118
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:01,672
I know how busy you are.

119
00:07:01,778 --> 00:07:03,213
Well, it's not a problem.

120
00:07:03,516 --> 00:07:06,040
You see, I recently started a
relationship with his mother,

121
00:07:06,147 --> 00:07:08,143
so you can't blame
him for being angry.

122
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:11,290
I'm just surprised at
this hateful accusation.

123
00:07:11,685 --> 00:07:15,312
Still, I think it's best if we
just forget it ever happened.

124
00:07:15,818 --> 00:07:19,151
I spent that day with your father,
outside the school.

125
00:07:19,826 --> 00:07:22,550
I was the one that told
him his brother had died.

126
00:07:23,248 --> 00:07:27,842
What you've done here today
is reckless and inexcusable.

127
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:32,262
And I think you
owe him an apology.

128
00:07:54,268 --> 00:07:55,793
He's a troubled boy.

129
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:01,832
Mom, what the hell?

130
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:03,371
I'm cleaning my gun.

131
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:05,731
You don't want me to have a misfire,
do you?

132
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:09,261
Well, here's a thought --
no gun, no misfire. Problem solved.

133
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:10,382
What's the fun in that?

134
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:13,601
Oh, by the way, Haley told me that
you invited her to a shooting range.

135
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:15,201
Are you completely
out of your mind?

136
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:17,392
There is some evidence
to support that.

137
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:19,451
Mom, guns and babies don't mix.

138
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:20,731
Oh, Nathan, don't worry.

139
00:08:20,838 --> 00:08:22,071
As soon as the baby is born,

140
00:08:22,175 --> 00:08:24,862
the gun will be stored in my
locker at the shooting range.

141
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,863
You've got a locker at
the shooting range?

142
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:32,290
Forget it. I'm late for school.

143
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:38,020
Joan Rivers, huh?

144
00:08:38,504 --> 00:08:40,072
Some lofty aspirations.

145
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:42,808
No making fun,
X games gold medalist.

146
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,252
Ah, you already looked
me up in the yearbook.

147
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,440
That's good to know.

148
00:08:46,545 --> 00:08:48,441
Don't get cocky.
I didn't look you up.

149
00:08:48,546 --> 00:08:50,871
I just opened it to a random page,
and there you were.

150
00:08:50,976 --> 00:08:52,360
Some people would
call that fate.

151
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,103
I call it a coincidence.

152
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:02,953
So... I was wondering --

153
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:05,771
why did you leave Clean Teens?

154
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:10,162
I realized I was just
hiding out in Clean Teens.

155
00:09:10,535 --> 00:09:13,243
I mean, I didn't join the club
because I was against sex.

156
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:15,953
I'm sure I'd actually like sex.

157
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,672
You definitely would.

158
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:20,131
Yeah. My point is,
I thought if I joined Clean Teens,

159
00:09:20,238 --> 00:09:21,931
girls wouldn't be
interested in me,

160
00:09:22,306 --> 00:09:24,793
and then maybe I wouldn't
have my heart broken again.

161
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,493
And then I came along.

162
00:09:26,595 --> 00:09:27,632
Yep.

163
00:09:28,286 --> 00:09:29,821
So that didn't work.

164
00:09:30,806 --> 00:09:32,012
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:34,773
If it means anything,
I've been thinking about you.

166
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:36,671
Me too.

167
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:38,461
Really?

168
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:40,262
What you been thinking?

169
00:09:41,486 --> 00:09:44,102
Well, how about I write
it in your yearbook?

170
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:47,480
This isn't mine.

171
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:50,221
It's Bevin's.
She's signing mine this period.

172
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:52,081
Oh. Okay.

173
00:09:52,297 --> 00:09:55,182
But we could exchange
books in calculus tomorrow.

174
00:09:55,287 --> 00:09:57,150
That way,
I can sign yours, too.

175
00:09:57,917 --> 00:09:59,181
I'd like that.

176
00:09:59,715 --> 00:10:01,082
I'll see you there.

177
00:10:35,398 --> 00:10:36,360
Hey, Mouth.

178
00:10:36,465 --> 00:10:38,111
Gigi. Hi.

179
00:10:38,217 --> 00:10:39,910
I didn't know you were
on the yearbook staff.

180
00:10:39,948 --> 00:10:41,482
I like to keep myself occupied.

181
00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:42,452
Good idea.

182
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,072
Listen, I have to ask you
something about the yearbook.

183
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:46,700
I thought it might bother you.

184
00:10:46,808 --> 00:10:48,551
I hope you're not
upset with me.

185
00:10:48,657 --> 00:10:50,280
Why would I be upset with you?

186
00:10:50,387 --> 00:10:52,323
Oh, no reason.

187
00:10:52,638 --> 00:10:55,473
Actually, um, I'm upset about
what's not in the yearbook.

188
00:10:55,577 --> 00:10:57,422
Jimmy Edwards.
Here, look at his picture.

189
00:10:57,527 --> 00:10:59,881
That's Jimmy.
Why was he cropped out?

190
00:10:59,986 --> 00:11:03,733
Well, he was originally in it,
but we were told to take him out.

191
00:11:15,547 --> 00:11:18,010
You know, I think I'm actually
getting fatter by the minute.

192
00:11:18,116 --> 00:11:19,042
I hope so.

193
00:11:19,147 --> 00:11:20,753
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

194
00:11:20,785 --> 00:11:24,083
No, because the bigger you get,
the taller our son's gonna be.

195
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:26,231
So it's all right if I look like
a weeble wobble as long as our son

196
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:28,111
can dunk a basketball?

197
00:11:28,337 --> 00:11:29,801
Have you finished
your speech yet?

198
00:11:29,907 --> 00:11:33,552
I'm, uh, I'm not gonna be
giving a speech.

199
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:35,020
Haley, come on.

200
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,741
Look, everybody knows
you're pregnant, okay?

201
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:38,751
Pregnant people get bigger.
It's natural.

202
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:41,741
It's actually principal Turner.

203
00:11:41,845 --> 00:11:44,981
He told me that I'm not allowed
to give the speech on graduation.

204
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:46,651
What are you
talking about? Why?

205
00:11:46,758 --> 00:11:52,223
He just said the whole, uh,
Rachel scandal test thing

206
00:11:52,326 --> 00:11:55,572
has just kind of made
it not appropriate.

207
00:11:55,678 --> 00:11:57,372
It's 'cause of me, isn't it?

208
00:11:58,257 --> 00:11:59,370
Yeah.

209
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:03,991
Look, it's really okay.

210
00:12:04,415 --> 00:12:07,662
It is. It's not a big deal, okay?
It's just some stupid speech

211
00:12:07,766 --> 00:12:09,761
I probably wouldn't have
even finished, anyway.

212
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:11,761
It's not a stupid speech.

213
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:14,171
- And they can't do this to you, Haley.
- They can.

214
00:12:14,277 --> 00:12:18,010
And it's not...
it doesn't matter.

215
00:12:18,425 --> 00:12:19,893
High school's almost over.

216
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:22,792
You know,
let them take the stupid speech.

217
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:25,630
They can't take away everything
else I've accomplished.

218
00:12:29,545 --> 00:12:30,872
So, how you holding up?

219
00:12:32,005 --> 00:12:34,740
Oh, well, I've been better.

220
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:37,690
How are you doing?
You were the one who was attacked.

221
00:12:37,896 --> 00:12:40,481
Yeah. That's why I stopped by.

222
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:42,760
I was up all night, Karen.

223
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:45,172
I'm really worried about Lucas.

224
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:47,323
Yeah.

225
00:12:47,995 --> 00:12:51,082
I wish I could get into his head and
understand what its he's going through.

226
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,073
Well, that's just it --
we can't get in his head.

227
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:56,341
And I think this problem is too
serious to deal with ourselves.

228
00:12:56,516 --> 00:12:57,762
What are you saying?

229
00:12:57,866 --> 00:12:59,802
I want to be there for you,
for the baby.

230
00:12:59,908 --> 00:13:02,301
I want to be there for Lucas,
but suddenly he's lashing out.

231
00:13:02,337 --> 00:13:03,581
Yeah, well, can you blame him?

232
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:04,650
No.

233
00:13:04,757 --> 00:13:06,581
But I do think he
needs guidance.

234
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:08,582
We should get him some
professional help.

235
00:13:08,685 --> 00:13:11,110
Someone to help him through
this awkward period of us,

236
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:13,512
of replacing Keith,
of all of it.

237
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,022
I love Lucas.

238
00:13:17,478 --> 00:13:19,862
And I really think it's important
that we do this for him.

239
00:13:27,436 --> 00:13:29,642
Hey. Peyton,
I need your opinion on something,

240
00:13:29,746 --> 00:13:31,792
and feel free to be
brutally honest.

241
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:34,892
Yeah, 'cause it really worked out last
time I was brutally honest with you.

242
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:36,772
Okay, first of all,
let's not go there.

243
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:39,902
Second, as long as you don't declare
your love for Chase, we'll be fine.

244
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:42,673
Well, he is seriously cute.

245
00:13:43,495 --> 00:13:44,443
Too soon?

246
00:13:44,546 --> 00:13:45,783
- Too soon.
- Sorry.

247
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:47,961
Anyway, I'm signing
Chase's yearbook tomorrow,

248
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:50,962
and I've prepared two
possible inscriptions.

249
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:52,820
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

250
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:55,440
One expresses my true
feelings for him,

251
00:13:55,547 --> 00:13:58,852
and the other talks about how
cool I think skateboarding is.

252
00:13:59,285 --> 00:14:03,302
Brooke, you sure about this?
Like, you really want Chase back?

253
00:14:03,648 --> 00:14:04,580
Yes.

254
00:14:04,685 --> 00:14:06,591
I want him, I miss him,

255
00:14:06,697 --> 00:14:10,821
and if he's gonna put himself out there,
then so will I.

256
00:14:10,928 --> 00:14:12,721
Wait, how do you know he's
gonna put himself out there?

257
00:14:12,756 --> 00:14:15,750
Because he told me he's gonna tell me
how he feels about me in my yearbook.

258
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:18,681
Well, good.
I hope this works out.

259
00:14:18,785 --> 00:14:20,091
Thanks. Me too.

260
00:14:20,395 --> 00:14:22,482
Besides, he's a
really good kisser.

261
00:14:22,827 --> 00:14:24,502
Okay. Let me know
what you think.

262
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:34,981
Lucas...

263
00:14:35,156 --> 00:14:36,571
I need to talk to you.

264
00:14:44,337 --> 00:14:45,610
I love you.

265
00:14:46,245 --> 00:14:48,342
You are the most important
person in my life,

266
00:14:48,446 --> 00:14:51,143
and it kills me to see
you hurting like this.

267
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:54,592
But Keith is gone,

268
00:14:54,697 --> 00:14:57,202
and he's not coming back.

269
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:04,203
And, eventually,
I need to go on with my life.

270
00:15:04,378 --> 00:15:05,583
With Dan?

271
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:07,023
Maybe.

272
00:15:10,705 --> 00:15:11,730
I don't know.

273
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:17,760
Lucas, let me in. Please.

274
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:19,570
You won't believe me, mom.

275
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:20,992
Try me.

276
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:30,703
I had a dream.

277
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:35,710
I saw this girl the
day Keith was shot.

278
00:15:36,865 --> 00:15:38,353
And she's in the hallway.

279
00:15:38,925 --> 00:15:41,131
She watched it happen.

280
00:15:41,456 --> 00:15:42,932
She saw everything.

281
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,102
Okay.

282
00:15:47,075 --> 00:15:49,663
It was real, mom. It --

283
00:15:51,537 --> 00:15:54,750
The girl -- I found her.

284
00:15:55,358 --> 00:15:57,591
Her name's Abby, and she --

285
00:15:59,207 --> 00:16:00,462
she was there.

286
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:03,741
She watched Keith die.

287
00:16:04,476 --> 00:16:05,471
She told me.

288
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:08,023
She told you she saw
Jimmy shoot Keith?

289
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:10,971
No.

290
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:18,372
She told me Dan shot Keith.

291
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,553
Now she's gone.

292
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:23,680
I can't prove it.

293
00:16:24,408 --> 00:16:28,830
Lucas, I know how desperately
you want to believe in this.

294
00:16:28,937 --> 00:16:30,490
No, it's true.

295
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:37,452
I think that it is time that
you go talk to somebody --

296
00:16:37,558 --> 00:16:40,543
a professional, somebody
who can help you through this.

297
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:42,542
I'm not crazy.

298
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:43,980
I know.

299
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:48,580
But I think that you have a problem.
We both think so.

300
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,481
"We"?

301
00:16:51,437 --> 00:16:52,853
Dan and I.

302
00:16:55,928 --> 00:16:57,190
Lucas...

303
00:17:00,808 --> 00:17:02,291
...do this for us.

304
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:08,922
Please.

305
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,201
Oh, Mr. McFadden.

306
00:17:25,857 --> 00:17:27,342
What can I do for you?

307
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,531
I want to know why you had Jimmy
Edwards removed from the yearbook.

308
00:17:30,638 --> 00:17:33,960
Jimmy Edwards is no longer
a student at this school.

309
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:37,471
Well, in two days, I won't be,
either, but I'm still in the yearbook.

310
00:17:39,035 --> 00:17:43,893
Look, Mouth, a yearbook
is a collection of memories,

311
00:17:43,995 --> 00:17:47,661
a book that, 20 years from now,
these students will flip through

312
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,212
and remember what they
loved about this school.

313
00:17:50,455 --> 00:17:54,513
Now, I don't want them to look back
and be reminded of that terrible day.

314
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:56,460
It happened.

315
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,861
It's a part of all of us.

316
00:17:59,706 --> 00:18:02,153
But he deserves
to be remembered.

317
00:18:02,455 --> 00:18:03,750
Trust me,

318
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:06,850
no one will ever
forget Jimmy Edwards.

319
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:12,733
Have you told Lucas
about the internship yet?

320
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,450
No, not yet.
I haven't been able to reach him.

321
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:19,590
Sorry, but you might
want to get used to it.

322
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:23,202
Life as Lucas Scott's girlfriend
can be pretty lonely sometimes.

323
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:31,023
Uh-oh. Moment of truth.
You got your cheat sheet?

324
00:18:32,155 --> 00:18:33,341
Which one are you gonna use?

325
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:34,920
I'm gonna tell him how I feel.

326
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,803
Wish me luck.

327
00:18:37,775 --> 00:18:38,790
Hey.

328
00:18:38,976 --> 00:18:40,852
Saved you a spot-- first page.

329
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:42,150
Perfect.

330
00:18:49,426 --> 00:18:51,452
Hey, Mouth.
I brought you something.

331
00:18:52,028 --> 00:18:53,343
It's Jimmy's.

332
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:55,120
I don't understand.

333
00:18:55,227 --> 00:18:56,863
His mom ordered it last fall.

334
00:18:56,966 --> 00:19:00,102
We were gonna mail it to her, but I
figured you'd want to take it to her.

335
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:01,351
Thanks.

336
00:19:01,897 --> 00:19:04,292
I don't know what she wants with a
yearbook that Jimmy's not even in,

337
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:06,193
but I'll take it to her.

338
00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:09,500
Do you have a free
period right now?

339
00:19:09,605 --> 00:19:12,500
Gigi, I'm a senior.
I pretty much have a free week.

340
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:14,011
Good. Come on.

341
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:19,521
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

342
00:19:25,475 --> 00:19:26,811
Thanks again, Brooke.

343
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:27,802
Sure.

344
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:29,033
So I'll see you later?

345
00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:30,423
Hope so.

346
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:40,621
Oh, no.

347
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:50,972
Nice shot.

348
00:19:51,596 --> 00:19:53,730
You always make
it look so easy.

349
00:19:53,836 --> 00:19:56,240
There's no pressure out here.
There's nothing on the line.

350
00:19:56,345 --> 00:19:59,223
Besides, on this court,
the shots don't really matter.

351
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:02,852
They all matter, Nathan --
every shot.

352
00:20:04,905 --> 00:20:08,440
Duke has rescinded your
scholarship offer.

353
00:20:10,757 --> 00:20:13,171
I'm sorry I couldn't
help you on this one.

354
00:20:15,056 --> 00:20:16,632
I understand.

355
00:20:19,065 --> 00:20:20,813
So I guess it's over, huh?

356
00:20:21,245 --> 00:20:23,423
As far as I know,
basketball's never over

357
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:26,161
till you put down the ball
and walk off the court.

358
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,730
You know what I mean, coach.

359
00:20:27,838 --> 00:20:30,050
No, Nathan, I don't think I do.

360
00:20:30,556 --> 00:20:33,851
What the heck have I been
teaching you all these years?

361
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,521
When somebody says you can't
do something, you fight back.

362
00:20:37,627 --> 00:20:38,840
You prove them wrong.

363
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:40,680
They took away my
scholarship, coach.

364
00:20:40,785 --> 00:20:42,080
They don't want me anymore.

365
00:20:42,185 --> 00:20:44,391
Then find somebody who does.

366
00:20:44,496 --> 00:20:48,763
Nathan, where is the fire that made
you the best player I ever coached?

367
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:50,481
Show me it's still there.

368
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:51,870
If it's not,

369
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:54,970
put down that ball and
walk off the court.

370
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:02,981
People love a guy who
rises from the ashes.

371
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:05,131
Remember that.

372
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:19,652
What are you doing here, Lucas?

373
00:21:23,736 --> 00:21:26,300
Why did you paint
this wall red, Dan?

374
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:29,170
You covering something up?

375
00:21:29,328 --> 00:21:30,601
I wanted it red.

376
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:31,853
I like red.

377
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:34,280
Abby told me she
sent you messages...

378
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:36,343
stalked you.

379
00:21:37,705 --> 00:21:40,123
Did she write something
on this wall, Dan?

380
00:21:40,226 --> 00:21:42,713
That girl's crazy.
She's gotten inside your head, Lucas.

381
00:21:42,815 --> 00:21:44,360
I know what you did.

382
00:21:45,968 --> 00:21:47,721
But I can't prove it.

383
00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:51,883
So all I can do now is
keep you away from my mom.

384
00:21:52,218 --> 00:21:53,933
I can see that you're upset,

385
00:21:54,056 --> 00:21:55,870
but everything's gonna be okay.

386
00:21:56,037 --> 00:21:58,301
You're gonna go off to school,
and I'm gonna stay here

387
00:21:58,408 --> 00:21:59,910
and take care of your
mom and the baby.

388
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:01,382
That's not gonna happen.

389
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,221
You'll realize
it's a good thing.

390
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:04,692
Your mom needs me.

391
00:22:04,797 --> 00:22:06,132
You'll see.

392
00:22:12,135 --> 00:22:14,733
Coach. Hi,
this is Nathan Scott.

393
00:22:14,837 --> 00:22:15,812
Yeah.

394
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,612
Well, I was wondering if you
still needed a shooting guard,

395
00:22:18,715 --> 00:22:20,883
'cause I'd love to
come up there and --

396
00:22:22,998 --> 00:22:25,531
Yeah. I understand.

397
00:22:25,976 --> 00:22:27,413
Thanks for your time.

398
00:22:32,545 --> 00:22:33,820
Any luck?

399
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:36,371
It's over, Haley.

400
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:38,282
Nobody wants anything
to do with me.

401
00:22:38,385 --> 00:22:40,220
- Don't say that.
- It's true.

402
00:22:40,498 --> 00:22:42,113
I ruined everything.

403
00:22:42,218 --> 00:22:45,160
And now you can't even give this
speech that you worked so hard for,

404
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:46,460
that you earned,

405
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,071
because I screwed it up.

406
00:22:48,176 --> 00:22:50,130
I don't care about
the speech, Nathan.

407
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,030
I care about us.

408
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:54,780
I love you.

409
00:22:56,447 --> 00:22:57,700
Do you love me?

410
00:22:57,895 --> 00:22:59,330
Of course I love you.

411
00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:02,472
That's all that matters,
all right?

412
00:23:02,828 --> 00:23:06,323
We are gonna find a way to
get through this together.

413
00:23:07,145 --> 00:23:08,671
I promise you.

414
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:22,000
You know, uh,
for what it's worth,

415
00:23:22,106 --> 00:23:23,670
I miss hanging out with you.

416
00:23:24,468 --> 00:23:25,842
I miss it, too.

417
00:23:26,065 --> 00:23:27,710
I think about you all the time.

418
00:23:27,815 --> 00:23:28,601
Really?

419
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:29,693
Of course.

420
00:23:29,797 --> 00:23:32,723
But I still think we made the
right decision to break up.

421
00:23:33,557 --> 00:23:35,763
I'm pretty sure you were
flying solo on that decision,

422
00:23:35,867 --> 00:23:37,741
but, uh, I understood it.

423
00:23:37,846 --> 00:23:39,252
I still do.

424
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,643
But who knows? Maybe some day.

425
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:46,300
This is incredible, Gigi.
What can I do to thank you?

426
00:23:46,407 --> 00:23:47,990
You can let me sign
your yearbook.

427
00:23:48,096 --> 00:23:49,693
I was hoping you would.

428
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:56,922
Read this.

429
00:23:58,756 --> 00:24:01,020
"Brooke, I'm glad we got to
know each other this year.

430
00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:03,293
Good luck in the
future. Chase."

431
00:24:03,396 --> 00:24:04,650
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

432
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:06,681
And I just poured my
heart out in his yearbook.

433
00:24:06,785 --> 00:24:07,990
I'm so embarrassed.

434
00:24:08,097 --> 00:24:10,890
Maybe you should have opted for that
"skateboarders are cool" version.

435
00:24:10,898 --> 00:24:15,043
This is not funny. I can never
show my face at this school again.

436
00:24:15,148 --> 00:24:16,232
Yeah.

437
00:24:16,336 --> 00:24:18,252
It's a good thing high
school's almost over.

438
00:24:18,355 --> 00:24:20,180
- Shut up.
- Hey!

439
00:24:27,135 --> 00:24:28,292
All done.

440
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:29,680
That didn't take long.

441
00:24:29,786 --> 00:24:30,861
You were easy.

442
00:24:30,968 --> 00:24:32,102
I hope that's a good thing.

443
00:24:32,207 --> 00:24:33,411
It is.

444
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:37,762
I don't know if I'll get to
see you before you leave, so...

445
00:24:37,865 --> 00:24:39,442
I'll say goodbye now.

446
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,670
I'm gonna miss you, Mouth.

447
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:43,900
I'll miss you, too.

448
00:24:44,588 --> 00:24:45,732
Come here.

449
00:24:50,597 --> 00:24:53,971
Hey, Gigi. Yesterday,
when you asked if I was upset with you

450
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:57,201
because of what was in the yearbook,
what did you mean?

451
00:24:57,507 --> 00:24:59,140
Page 23.

452
00:25:18,238 --> 00:25:21,111
Hey. Look who decided
to come out of hiding.

453
00:25:21,217 --> 00:25:22,962
Since when do you ditch school?

454
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:25,722
Finals are over. Give me one good
reason to be here this week.

455
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:27,801
Actually, I have one.

456
00:25:28,865 --> 00:25:30,620
This is yours --
I picked it up this morning

457
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:32,561
'cause I wanted to be the
very first one to sign it.

458
00:25:32,596 --> 00:25:33,830
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

459
00:25:33,937 --> 00:25:36,451
I kind of got carried away
and took up an entire page.

460
00:25:36,556 --> 00:25:38,580
But I figured that's my
right as a best friend.

461
00:25:38,818 --> 00:25:40,351
You are my best friend.

462
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:45,091
I can't believe high
school is almost over.

463
00:25:46,215 --> 00:25:48,652
Do you remember the first
day of freshman year?

464
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:51,162
Oh, yes. You asked me to
pretend to be your boyfriend

465
00:25:51,265 --> 00:25:52,431
so the other guys
wouldn't bother you.

466
00:25:52,465 --> 00:25:54,653
You were the best
fake boyfriend ever.

467
00:25:54,756 --> 00:25:56,441
Seems like forever ago, huh?

468
00:25:56,545 --> 00:25:58,620
Did you ever think this was
how senior year would end up?

469
00:25:58,655 --> 00:26:01,013
What? Me married, pregnant,
living with a recovering junkie

470
00:26:01,068 --> 00:26:02,953
who is packing
heat? Absolutely.

471
00:26:03,455 --> 00:26:04,400
What was that?

472
00:26:04,505 --> 00:26:07,390
Deb -- she keeps a gun in
the kitchen in a cookie jar.

473
00:26:07,496 --> 00:26:10,682
She asked me to go to the shooting
range with her -- while I'm pregnant.

474
00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:12,160
She's out of her mind.

475
00:26:19,006 --> 00:26:20,170
Hello?

476
00:26:21,677 --> 00:26:22,991
Anybody home?

477
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:52,433
Hey, coach.

478
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:54,813
Got a minute?

479
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:58,640
Looks like I'm getting more visits at
the house than I got in my office.

480
00:26:58,747 --> 00:27:00,761
- Are you?
- I guess since I retired,

481
00:27:00,865 --> 00:27:03,133
I ought to start a new business

482
00:27:03,237 --> 00:27:05,531
and charge fees for my advice.

483
00:27:05,637 --> 00:27:08,031
That's not a bad idea.
What do you think you'll call it?

484
00:27:08,138 --> 00:27:10,311
Oh, I don't know.
I'll think of something.

485
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:13,772
Well, I don't know how much advice I
need, but I could sure use your help.

486
00:27:13,877 --> 00:27:16,393
- What can I do for you?
- You can help Nathan.

487
00:27:16,498 --> 00:27:18,603
Everybody's turned their back on him.
You're the only person

488
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,443
that's never let him down.

489
00:27:20,786 --> 00:27:24,250
Haley, I don't know what I
could do for him at this point.

490
00:27:24,695 --> 00:27:27,680
Well, I'm sure you could
think of something.

491
00:27:30,446 --> 00:27:33,853
Coach, he's still that guy that
helped you win all those games.

492
00:27:34,568 --> 00:27:36,600
He's got the heart of a champion.
You've know that.

493
00:27:36,637 --> 00:27:39,923
You watched him grow.
You know the kind of person that he is.

494
00:27:40,897 --> 00:27:44,263
Can't you just help him
be more that person,

495
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,873
help him for all the
times he's helped you?

496
00:27:50,957 --> 00:27:52,643
Let me think on it.

497
00:28:17,076 --> 00:28:19,521
Hi... freshmen.

498
00:28:19,627 --> 00:28:20,892
Great.

499
00:28:21,838 --> 00:28:24,671
As your student-council president,
I just wanted to come by

500
00:28:24,777 --> 00:28:27,782
and personally say good luck
with the rest of high school.

501
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,583
You guys are gonna love
the next three years.

502
00:28:30,686 --> 00:28:32,383
I can't wait.

503
00:28:33,975 --> 00:28:35,951
Well, maybe not all of you.

504
00:28:36,156 --> 00:28:37,272
Okay.

505
00:28:37,378 --> 00:28:38,630
Have a good day.

506
00:28:46,585 --> 00:28:48,801
Excuse me --
I have a boyfriend.

507
00:28:48,905 --> 00:28:49,982
Really?

508
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,552
Where is he?

509
00:28:51,655 --> 00:28:54,700
Good question. I've been wondering
that myself for two days.

510
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:56,753
Yeah, I guess I deserved that.

511
00:28:56,856 --> 00:28:58,822
It makes a girl feel cheap --
give it up in Honey Grove,

512
00:28:58,858 --> 00:29:00,210
and then, poof,
vanishing boyfriend.

513
00:29:00,245 --> 00:29:01,763
- Poof?
- Poof.

514
00:29:03,187 --> 00:29:04,533
Look, I'm sorry.

515
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:07,951
I kind of have this habit
of crawling into my shell.

516
00:29:08,057 --> 00:29:11,702
Well, quit your dumb habit, 'cause your
girlfriend really needs you this weekend.

517
00:29:11,806 --> 00:29:13,112
What's going on?

518
00:29:13,397 --> 00:29:17,421
I have an impossible decision to make
and not a whole lot of time to make it in.

519
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:19,663
Okay. Look, I'm here now.

520
00:29:19,768 --> 00:29:21,072
Tell me about it.

521
00:29:23,008 --> 00:29:26,680
I applied for an internship with
Sire Records a few months ago,

522
00:29:26,788 --> 00:29:28,390
before we were together.

523
00:29:28,578 --> 00:29:31,331
And I just found out I got it.

524
00:29:31,877 --> 00:29:33,613
Oh, my god, that's great.

525
00:29:33,718 --> 00:29:35,530
It's in Los Angeles.

526
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:41,193
Take it.

527
00:29:42,268 --> 00:29:43,631
You deserve it.

528
00:29:45,286 --> 00:29:46,832
I don't want to leave you.

529
00:29:46,938 --> 00:29:49,013
I will be here
when you get back.

530
00:29:50,218 --> 00:29:53,472
But your are destined for greatness,
Peyton, and we both know that.

531
00:29:53,778 --> 00:29:56,453
And this is your first step.
You can't pass that up.

532
00:29:56,818 --> 00:29:57,743
Are you sure?

533
00:29:57,847 --> 00:29:59,020
Yeah.

534
00:29:59,336 --> 00:30:01,013
I'm so proud of you.

535
00:30:04,795 --> 00:30:08,620
Look, Peyton...
you know I love you, right?

536
00:30:08,728 --> 00:30:09,823
Yeah.

537
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:12,783
No matter what happens
to either one of us,

538
00:30:13,227 --> 00:30:16,020
you will always be in my heart.

539
00:30:18,015 --> 00:30:20,980
Excuse me, everybody.
This will only take a minute.

540
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:26,840
This yearbook belongs
to Jimmy Edwards.

541
00:30:26,955 --> 00:30:28,902
Now, everyone knows his name,

542
00:30:29,068 --> 00:30:31,881
but some of you actually
knew Jimmy before that day.

543
00:30:32,377 --> 00:30:36,292
Maybe you sat with him at lunch.
Maybe you went to grade school together.

544
00:30:38,418 --> 00:30:40,513
If you knew Jimmy even
for a short time,

545
00:30:40,617 --> 00:30:43,613
then you probably have
some good memories of him.

546
00:30:43,715 --> 00:30:46,523
And I hope you'll consider writing
them down in this yearbook.

547
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:48,400
Thanks.

548
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:55,301
Lucas, I know how
you feel about Jimmy,

549
00:30:55,408 --> 00:30:57,233
but it's the right thing to do.

550
00:30:59,546 --> 00:31:00,770
I know it is.

551
00:31:02,017 --> 00:31:03,333
Got a pen?

552
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:10,503
Hey.

553
00:31:11,486 --> 00:31:13,082
You're a great friend, Mouth.

554
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,023
Jimmy would really
appreciate this.

555
00:31:33,827 --> 00:31:34,932
Principal Turner?

556
00:31:35,488 --> 00:31:38,421
Whatever it is, Mr. Scott,
it'll have to wait.

557
00:31:39,078 --> 00:31:40,281
I'm very busy.

558
00:31:40,387 --> 00:31:42,242
This won't take long,
I promise.

559
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:45,403
Okay.

560
00:31:48,728 --> 00:31:49,810
Okay.

561
00:31:50,536 --> 00:31:51,863
I'm sorry.

562
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,772
I know I embarrassed you,

563
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:56,990
I embarrassed the school,
and I'm sorry for that -- I am.

564
00:31:57,546 --> 00:31:59,730
But, please,
don't take this out on Haley.

565
00:31:59,838 --> 00:32:02,350
This wasn't an easy
decision, Nathan.

566
00:32:02,455 --> 00:32:03,851
But you made it.

567
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:07,121
And now the best student --
the best person -- in this school

568
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:09,882
can't give a speech because
she's married to me.

569
00:32:10,298 --> 00:32:12,133
Does that sound fair to you?

570
00:32:13,046 --> 00:32:15,151
You should know that I've
received numerous phone calls

571
00:32:15,187 --> 00:32:17,401
from parents and
school-board members.

572
00:32:19,216 --> 00:32:21,612
Do you have a wife,
principal Turner?

573
00:32:22,655 --> 00:32:23,960
Yes, I do.

574
00:32:24,768 --> 00:32:26,702
Is she the best part of you?

575
00:32:27,626 --> 00:32:30,403
Would you want her to
pay for your mistakes?

576
00:32:31,978 --> 00:32:33,782
We've all made mistakes.

577
00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:38,093
And, believe me, I'm paying for mine,
but Haley's a good person.

578
00:32:38,197 --> 00:32:42,121
And she's worked for four years
to be valedictorian, and...

579
00:32:43,886 --> 00:32:45,842
she deserves to be recognized.

580
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:04,961
Hi.

581
00:33:05,088 --> 00:33:06,183
Come in.

582
00:33:23,896 --> 00:33:24,911
Hey.

583
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,553
It's getting a little late.
I'm kind of hungry.

584
00:33:27,658 --> 00:33:29,221
- You hungry?
- No.

585
00:33:29,566 --> 00:33:31,820
Let's go out.
We never go out anymore.

586
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,233
Let's go eat something really
bad for us and pig out.

587
00:33:34,338 --> 00:33:37,203
That sounds great, but you're
gonna be a little busy tonight.

588
00:33:37,305 --> 00:33:38,822
Doing what?

589
00:33:41,245 --> 00:33:43,561
- What is this?
- Graduation program.

590
00:33:43,668 --> 00:33:47,120
"Tree Hill
high school graduation.

591
00:33:47,838 --> 00:33:50,623
Valedictory address --
Haley James Scott"?

592
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,260
Turner changed his mind.

593
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:56,251
Are you for real?
Oh, come here! Thank you!

594
00:33:57,747 --> 00:33:59,511
Oh, my god!
I have to go start writing my speech!

595
00:33:59,615 --> 00:34:01,430
You got a lot of work to do.
I'll grab us something to eat --

596
00:34:01,467 --> 00:34:02,592
something really bad for us.

597
00:34:02,696 --> 00:34:04,842
No, I'm gonna be speaking in
front of a thousand people.

598
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,822
Plus, I'm pregnant.
I need healthy food.

599
00:34:06,926 --> 00:34:08,040
Healthy!

600
00:34:15,088 --> 00:34:16,070
Hey.

601
00:34:16,537 --> 00:34:17,663
You okay?

602
00:34:20,586 --> 00:34:22,612
I told Lucas about
the internship.

603
00:34:22,715 --> 00:34:23,610
What did he say?

604
00:34:23,718 --> 00:34:24,963
He wants me to go.

605
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:26,390
He's right.

606
00:34:28,136 --> 00:34:31,181
Was there a part of you that
was hoping he'd ask you to stay?

607
00:34:31,285 --> 00:34:33,393
Oh, no, no. It's not that.

608
00:34:34,328 --> 00:34:35,732
There's something
going on with him,

609
00:34:35,767 --> 00:34:37,672
and I just worry about
being away all summer.

610
00:34:37,777 --> 00:34:40,260
Peyton, when has Lucas ever
not made the right decision?

611
00:34:40,365 --> 00:34:42,042
Well, let's see.

612
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,561
He didn't take his heart
pills and collapsed recently.

613
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:46,032
You know what I mean.

614
00:34:46,468 --> 00:34:49,111
Okay, if you're worried about your
relationship, it's one thing.

615
00:34:49,218 --> 00:34:51,370
But I don't think
you need to be.

616
00:34:51,835 --> 00:34:54,320
Lucas is right --
take the internship...

617
00:34:54,556 --> 00:34:57,191
and have a fabulous summer
in L.A. with me.

618
00:35:01,856 --> 00:35:02,993
I'll get it.

619
00:35:11,185 --> 00:35:12,230
Hey.

620
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:13,812
Can I help you?

621
00:35:14,888 --> 00:35:17,472
I was hoping we could talk about
what you wrote in my yearbook.

622
00:35:18,138 --> 00:35:21,680
What's the point? I mean, I...
I didn't mean half the things I said.

623
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:25,560
I just for some stupid reason thought you
were gonna write something similar, so...

624
00:35:27,017 --> 00:35:28,240
I wanted to.

625
00:35:28,345 --> 00:35:30,471
Don't do that, okay?
It's too late.

626
00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:31,892
It's fine.

627
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:34,983
When I walked into
that classroom today,

628
00:35:35,088 --> 00:35:37,552
I was gonna tell you
exactly how I feel.

629
00:35:38,117 --> 00:35:40,392
I mean,
I wanted to earlier in the hallway.

630
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,702
So why didn't you?

631
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,043
I don't know.

632
00:35:45,256 --> 00:35:47,990
I guess I wasn't sure I wanted
to put my heart out there again.

633
00:35:50,337 --> 00:35:52,933
But, look, the point is

634
00:35:53,388 --> 00:35:55,443
everything that
you wrote to me,

635
00:35:55,845 --> 00:35:57,390
I feel it, too.

636
00:35:59,465 --> 00:36:01,650
I just didn't know how
to put it in words.

637
00:36:09,645 --> 00:36:11,160
You just did.

638
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,811
Hello. This is Whitey Durham.

639
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:58,770
I'm sorry to call so late, but I need
to speak to your athletic director.

640
00:37:07,287 --> 00:37:08,510
Marvin.

641
00:37:08,787 --> 00:37:10,291
I brought you something.

642
00:37:11,887 --> 00:37:13,391
It's Jimmy's yearbook.

643
00:37:13,808 --> 00:37:15,221
A lot of people signed it.

644
00:37:16,608 --> 00:37:19,091
They said some really
nice things about Jimmy.

645
00:38:35,197 --> 00:38:37,120
Lucas is gonna be okay, Karen.

646
00:38:37,225 --> 00:38:38,501
I don't know.

647
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:42,980
Something about this
just doesn't feel right.

648
00:38:44,798 --> 00:38:47,622
When I asked him to get help,
he looked...

649
00:38:48,128 --> 00:38:49,401
betrayed.

650
00:38:49,517 --> 00:38:50,941
Well, you did the right thing.

651
00:38:51,047 --> 00:38:53,041
He's out of control.
He's acting crazy.

652
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:59,092
My son is not crazy.

653
00:39:00,558 --> 00:39:02,890
I'm sorry, Karen.
I didn't mean it like that.

654
00:39:03,075 --> 00:39:06,502
This isn't easy for me, Dan --
any of this.

655
00:39:15,736 --> 00:39:16,922
What is it?

656
00:39:19,005 --> 00:39:21,320
Just a little problem
I thought I took care of.

657
00:39:21,748 --> 00:39:24,041
I have to go.
This won't take long.

658
00:39:24,148 --> 00:39:25,312
I'm sorry.

659
00:39:28,798 --> 00:39:30,440
Going somewhere, Dan?

660
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:33,313
What do you think
you're doing, Lucas?

661
00:39:34,947 --> 00:39:36,982
I'm protecting my mother.

662
00:39:42,978 --> 00:39:45,012
What are you gonna do,
shoot me?

663
00:39:45,378 --> 00:39:47,810
Yes, I am.

664
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:51,380
Just like you shot
my uncle Keith.

665
00:39:51,485 --> 00:39:54,201
Lucas, what are you
doing with a gun?

666
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:57,012
- Put that down right now.
- I can't.

667
00:39:57,116 --> 00:39:58,080
Lucas!

668
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,441
That little text
message Dan just got --

669
00:40:01,845 --> 00:40:02,953
I sent it.

670
00:40:03,758 --> 00:40:05,702
I pretended to be Abby --

671
00:40:05,806 --> 00:40:08,802
you know,
the girl who watched him murder Keith.

672
00:40:10,145 --> 00:40:11,320
You heard him --

673
00:40:11,427 --> 00:40:14,153
Abby's just a little problem
he thought he'd taken care of.

674
00:40:14,258 --> 00:40:16,013
Don't listen to him, Karen.
He's delusional.

675
00:40:16,078 --> 00:40:20,941
Maybe you should tell the truth when
I have a gun aimed at your head.

676
00:40:21,047 --> 00:40:23,843
Lucas, please,
just put the gun down, all right?

677
00:40:23,947 --> 00:40:25,202
I can't --

678
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:28,771
I can't --

679
00:40:31,938 --> 00:40:34,202
- Karen!
- Do not touch her!

680
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,541
Mom? Mom, are you okay?

681
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:37,890
She could be having
a miscarriage!

682
00:40:37,928 --> 00:40:39,883
You stay right there!
Do not touch her!

683
00:40:39,986 --> 00:40:43,392
That is my mother!
I swear to god I will kill you!

684
00:40:47,136 --> 00:40:51,573
