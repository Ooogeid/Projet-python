1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,418
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:02,764
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong is I don't have a job.

3
00:00:02,847 --> 00:00:04,478
I asked you to do
two things for me...

4
00:00:04,847 --> 00:00:06,138
make sure I play for the Bobcats

5
00:00:06,221 --> 00:00:08,051
and stay away from Quinn.
You're fired.

6
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:10,736
Maybe something went wrong
because Clay got careless.

7
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,455
You mean with me?

8
00:00:11,538 --> 00:00:13,253
If that's what he got fired for,

9
00:00:13,336 --> 00:00:15,398
Then I'm happy he's not
in Nathan's life anymore.

10
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:17,682
All right, so there's this
sports-coordination company

11
00:00:17,765 --> 00:00:19,438
called Sportsarc...
they want to talk to you.

12
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:20,540
That's good looking out.

13
00:00:20,623 --> 00:00:22,435
We do a live broadcast.

14
00:00:22,894 --> 00:00:24,429
From the hallway where
I murdered my brother?

15
00:00:25,283 --> 00:00:26,710
Where one of your
classmates committed suicide?

16
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,666
It's not happening for the script.

17
00:00:28,749 --> 00:00:29,989
So it's really over?

18
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,673
Yeah. I'm sorry.

19
00:00:33,128 --> 00:00:35,418
It's Millicent. I got
arrested, and I need your help.

20
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:36,893
I can't help you.

21
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:39,430
I am sorry, but the
test came back negative.

22
00:00:39,513 --> 00:00:41,755
You can't have children?
They told you that?

23
00:00:41,838 --> 00:00:43,232
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:44,029 --> 00:00:44,712
Brooke.

Www.Addic7ed.Com

27
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,885
You're kind of nicely dressed
for a guy who just got fired.

28
00:01:10,968 --> 00:01:12,984
Well, an agent should wear a suit.

29
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:15,234
Plus, I don't want
to get drowned again.

30
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:17,946
So which clients are
staying with you?

31
00:01:18,029 --> 00:01:20,273
None. ISC got to everyone.

32
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:21,878
Every single one?

33
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:22,988
Everyone they know about.

34
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:24,963
But there is a kid in Arkansas

35
00:01:25,046 --> 00:01:26,845
that agreed to sign
with me not too long ago.

36
00:01:26,928 --> 00:01:29,584
They don't know about him.

37
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:32,741
And there's a little secret
that only I know about him.

38
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:34,053
And what's that?

39
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:37,506
In four years, he is gonna be
the best quarterback in the NFL.

40
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:39,712
That's so great.

41
00:01:42,351 --> 00:01:43,479
You can do this.

42
00:01:45,076 --> 00:01:46,001
I'm so proud of you.

43
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,478
Thanks.

44
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:52,241
That means a lot.

45
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,064
It means everything, actually.

46
00:01:58,483 --> 00:01:59,887
Great. Yeah, I'll see you in a few.

47
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,903
Thanks.

48
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:04,287
That was the agency. They
got an offer coming in.

49
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,767
That's good news. From where?

50
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,619
Actually, I'm not sure,

51
00:02:07,702 --> 00:02:09,171
but they're on their way
over now to fill us in.

52
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,081
It sounded good, though, right?

53
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,148
I'll be playing in the NBA.

54
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:14,698
That's all that matters.

55
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:16,256
Ohh!

56
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,456
So, I was thinking about
taking some time off from...

57
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:28,348
well, doing nothing.

58
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:30,375
How'd you like to
spend some quality time

59
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:31,318
with your boyfriend?

60
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,863
I can't.

61
00:02:33,513 --> 00:02:35,002
Oh, come on.

62
00:02:35,085 --> 00:02:36,063
No really.

63
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:37,522
I need to go talk to Millicent.

64
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:39,944
I am so pissed at her,
so pissed that...

65
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:41,871
That you're gonna go over
and check that she's okay?

66
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:45,002
Yeah.

67
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,000
Love my girl.

68
00:02:53,868 --> 00:02:55,234
Hey.

69
00:02:57,033 --> 00:03:00,151
I don't need kids to make me happy.

70
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:02,167
I just need you, Brooke Davis.

71
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:07,667
What did I do to deserve you?

72
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:17,251
Okay, sizzle reel?

73
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:19,785
Yeah, you know, "sizzle" like "hot."

74
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:21,384
It's kind of like a highlight reel

75
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,418
that I can use to show
the company in Los Angeles

76
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:24,984
that I can actually do this job.

77
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:27,751
And Julian said if I turn in a
good reel, then they'll hire me.

78
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,950
I just don't know what to shoot.

79
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:31,484
You should get these guys.

80
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:33,175
"White men can't
jump." It's my favorite.

81
00:03:33,258 --> 00:03:35,934
These guys are awesome.

82
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,825
Someday,
I want to play just like them.

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,822
So, what are you and
chuck doin' this afternoon?

84
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:53,129
Hold that thought.

85
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:58,900
- Hey, Brooke, what's up?
- Hey

86
00:03:59,588 --> 00:04:01,467
Where's Millie?

87
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:04,284
I don't know. She didn't
come home last night.

88
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:05,934
You don't know?

89
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:08,151
Know what?

90
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:11,098
Millie got arrested for
drunk driving last night.

91
00:04:11,474 --> 00:04:13,579
I'm sorry, I thought
you would have heard.

92
00:04:13,662 --> 00:04:14,255
I'll call you.

93
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:22,838
Oh!

94
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:26,056
Victoria? What are you doing here?

95
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:29,095
Right now? Having second thoughts.

96
00:04:31,977 --> 00:04:32,758
Did you just bail me out?

97
00:04:32,841 --> 00:04:34,317
A simple "thank you" will suffice.

98
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,731
And now, if you're quite
finished with your star turn

99
00:04:37,814 --> 00:04:39,125
in "the slutshank redemption,"

100
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,677
- I think we'll be on our way.
- I'm so sorry, victoria.

101
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,171
Please save the gratitude
for someone who cares.

102
00:04:43,254 --> 00:04:44,597
I'm just protecting our investment.

103
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,572
Zero may not be a size,
but it's clearly your I.Q.

104
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,404
Now get yourself home,

105
00:04:49,487 --> 00:04:51,903
clean yourself up,
and whatever you do,

106
00:04:51,986 --> 00:04:53,504
don't show your face
at Clothes Over Bros

107
00:04:53,587 --> 00:04:55,675
until you're ready to
act like a professional.

108
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,318
So what you have to understand

109
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:12,951
is that right now every
NBA team has a full roster,

110
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:14,518
and most are capped out.

111
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:16,451
So, what do you guys propose?

112
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:18,318
Regal Barcelona.

113
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,451
Spain?

114
00:05:20,534 --> 00:05:22,118
I already turned down
a European offer.

115
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:23,684
The timing's different now.

116
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:26,485
We could probably get you
the league minimum somewhere,

117
00:05:26,568 --> 00:05:29,084
but that's gonna hurt your
profile in the long run.

118
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:31,617
Barcelona is a good get.

119
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,717
You see, the trick right now

120
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,151
is making sure your quote stays up

121
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:39,451
and keeping you viable now
that the Bobcat deal is dead.

122
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:42,518
Barcelona does both those things.

123
00:05:42,601 --> 00:05:44,917
But he wants to play in the NBA.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,485
And he will. Nate, you
got to trust us on this.

125
00:05:47,568 --> 00:05:51,084
Take the family to
Spain, work on your game,

126
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:54,668
and next year, we'll
have you back in the NBA.

127
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,465
Bright and early, as discussed.

128
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,672
Very commendable, Haley James Scott.

129
00:06:12,301 --> 00:06:13,626
Our "accidental
release" of your track

130
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:14,968
just went viral on the net.

131
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:16,992
Your fans are eating it
up like christmas trifle.

132
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:18,604
We have to finish this album.

133
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:19,823
Yeah, about that...

134
00:06:19,906 --> 00:06:21,843
um, how do you feel

135
00:06:21,926 --> 00:06:24,508
about me finishing the
remaining tracks in Spain?

136
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:27,254
Do you understand what's
happening right now?

137
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:28,635
This is lightning in a bottle.

138
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:30,618
It's been years since
your last album, Haley,

139
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:31,225
and you have momentum again.

140
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,396
We have to capitalize on that.

141
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,883
- Nathan got a job offer in Spain.
- Good.

142
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:37,081
Then you can send him a copy
of the album when we finish.

143
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,513
I'm serious, Miranda.

144
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:40,911
He's worked really hard
for this. It's his dream.

145
00:06:40,994 --> 00:06:43,083
And what about your dream?

146
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,834
Maybe it can wait a little longer.

147
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:48,282
Well, this says it can't.

148
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:52,661
That's a ticket to the
starttart of your tour

149
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:54,770
in advance support of
your new smash album.

150
00:06:54,853 --> 00:06:56,236
You ship out next week.

151
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,354
Not to do so would be a
violation of your contract.

152
00:06:58,437 --> 00:07:00,444
Well, I'm not sure I
can do this, Miranda.

153
00:07:00,527 --> 00:07:03,797
Well, the survival of
this label depends on it,

154
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,277
so you better get sure.

155
00:07:13,956 --> 00:07:15,850
Millie, this is like the fourth
time I've called. Where...

156
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:29,099
I'm glad you're okay.

157
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,518
But all of this needs to stop.

158
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:36,685
I need you to figure that out.

159
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:39,451
And I'm really afraid
of what might happen

160
00:07:39,534 --> 00:07:42,817
if you don't figure it out,
because...

161
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,134
I miss the old Millie.

162
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:48,184
I miss the Millie

163
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,451
that would rather stay
in and play video games

164
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:52,618
than stay out all
night without calling.

165
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:55,518
I miss the Millie who
cared about her real friends

166
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:57,351
and worked hard at her job.

167
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,200
I miss that Millie.

168
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:03,467
I want her back.

169
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:16,114
I still love you, Millicent.

170
00:08:39,234 --> 00:08:41,100
I'm sorry I said "I love you."

171
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:44,900
It's okay.

172
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:48,667
Come in.

173
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,418
Fact is,
I'm sorry about a lot of things

174
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,384
I've done these days.

175
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:59,184
I know I drive everyone crazy,

176
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:02,184
and Brooke must hate me right now.

177
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:04,584
It's hard because I...

178
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,584
I just thought that...

179
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,551
You thought what?

180
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:11,117
I thought we would be doing
this great thing, you know?

181
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,584
And now it's all over
before it even started.

182
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:16,584
Hey, I loved the script, too,

183
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:19,384
but there will be other
scripts, other projects.

184
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:20,884
You think so?

185
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:22,685
I know so. You're talented.

186
00:09:22,768 --> 00:09:24,950
The important thing is to
just keep moving forward.

187
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:26,618
I mean,
you know how Hollywood works.

188
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:27,834
It has nothing to do with you.

189
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,251
You always make me feel better.

190
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:33,284
It'll be okay, I promise.

191
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:35,484
Besides, I kind of need
to spend some quality time

192
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:36,718
with Brooke right now.

193
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:38,518
Is everything okay?

194
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:41,117
It will be eventually. It's just...

195
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,518
Just what? Please don't
tell me it's because of me.

196
00:09:43,601 --> 00:09:45,384
No. No, it's nothing like that.

197
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:47,017
It is. You're mad at me. I can tell.

198
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,651
No, Alex, it's just...

199
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:50,884
Just forget it.

200
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:52,351
Fine. It's obviously about me,

201
00:09:52,434 --> 00:09:53,817
'cause if it wasn't, you'd tell me.

202
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,384
We found out Brooke
can't get pregnant.

203
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:56,917
She can't have kids.

204
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,718
Oh, my God.

205
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:02,751
You must... she must be devastated.

206
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:04,618
Is there anything I can do to help?

207
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:06,351
No.

208
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:08,801
God, I shouldn't even have told you.

209
00:10:10,434 --> 00:10:12,817
So, please, let's just
keep it between us, okay?

210
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,117
Sure.

211
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,418
You know, to be honest,

212
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:19,351
I didn't even know I
wanted to have kids

213
00:10:19,434 --> 00:10:22,817
until the moment I found
out I might not be able to.

214
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,751
It's so sad.

215
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:29,551
You would have been
such a great dad.

216
00:10:29,634 --> 00:10:31,033
I'm sorry.

217
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:05,084
Okay.

218
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:06,551
All right.

219
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:08,518
Nothing riding on this...

220
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,384
just your whole career.

221
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:13,151
But you've done this
thousands of times.

222
00:11:13,234 --> 00:11:15,151
Kid with a big dream
wants to see it happen,

223
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:16,685
you make it happen.

224
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:18,551
You are the dream merchant.

225
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:20,567
And you are back.

226
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,950
Huh.

227
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:28,984
Excuse me, I... I seem
to have gotten lost.

228
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:31,351
I'm actually looking for the
next hot NFL Q.B. Prospect.

229
00:11:31,434 --> 00:11:32,751
I was wondering if you
could possibly point me

230
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:33,817
in the right direction?

231
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,718
Mr. Evans. It's good to see you.

232
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:37,151
Yeah, likewise. How you been, man?

233
00:11:37,234 --> 00:11:39,267
Good. You doin' all right?

234
00:11:44,601 --> 00:11:45,685
Penny for your thoughts.

235
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:46,984
Are you sure about that?

236
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:49,051
Might want your money
back after you hear 'em.

237
00:11:49,134 --> 00:11:50,734
Try me.

238
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:56,384
I think we should go to Spain.

239
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:58,484
I've been wrestling
with it all morning,

240
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:00,917
and in the end,
I think Ken is right.

241
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,384
If I sit out a year, I may
never make it back to the NBA.

242
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:06,251
Spain keeps me viable.

243
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:09,251
Spain assures that
I will make it back.

244
00:12:09,334 --> 00:12:11,751
There's no other option?

245
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:13,351
No.

246
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:15,718
And, look,
I know that it's not ideal,

247
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,950
but it makes sense.

248
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:19,518
And it's only for a year.

249
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:20,917
At least we'll be together.

250
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,685
Yeah.

251
00:12:22,768 --> 00:12:24,651
What? What's wrong?

252
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:26,751
The record company wants me to tour

253
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:29,551
in support of my new album.

254
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:32,768
I'm supposed to leave next week.

255
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:38,194
Wow.

256
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:50,084
Game ball from the conference
championships, right?

257
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:51,684
Right.

258
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:52,984
Yeah.

259
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:55,884
That... that was a great game.

260
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:57,684
What did you pass for?

261
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:59,817
400 yards.

262
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,550
It was 428 and 5 touchdowns,

263
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:04,951
but who's counting, right?

264
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,751
You don't miss anything, do you?

265
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:09,051
It's my job not to miss.

266
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:11,351
And I promise you
that I won't with you.

267
00:13:11,434 --> 00:13:12,784
All right, troy?

268
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:14,884
I will do everything that I
can to get you the best deal,

269
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:16,450
the best endorsements.

270
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:18,267
I know, but...

271
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,450
What's going on, Troy?

272
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:26,584
Ken Arthur called
my dad two days ago.

273
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,267
He said they fired you.

274
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,817
I'm Dan Scott, and I've
shown people the world over

275
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,084
how to rebuild their lives

276
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:37,651
through the power of forgiveness.

277
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,151
But what about me?

278
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:40,717
Can I be forgiven?

279
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,884
Tune in tomorrow for
a very special edition

280
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:44,484
of "Scott free: redemption."

281
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:46,817
And remember... the
truth will set you free.

282
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,900
Cut!

283
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:53,151
That was good, but I
think you can go bigger.

284
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:54,817
You don't think it's
already too big?

285
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,651
Too big? No, it's genius.

286
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:59,318
It'll take us to a
whole other level.

287
00:13:59,401 --> 00:14:02,930
Everyone, back to
one. We're going again.

288
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:10,751
Millie?

289
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:12,050
Oh, my God, are you okay?

290
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:13,518
I'm fine.

291
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:14,885
Was last night terrible or what?

292
00:14:14,968 --> 00:14:16,467
It is what it is. I said I'm fine.

293
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:20,117
Have you seen my 7's?

294
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,834
No.

295
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,017
Are these what you're looking for?

296
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,284
Yes!

297
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:33,451
Can I have my jeans, please?

298
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:35,434
Or is this what you're after?

299
00:14:36,434 --> 00:14:38,050
Alex!

300
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:39,017
That's mine.

301
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,451
Alex, don't!

302
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:41,551
- Don't!
- Millie.

303
00:14:41,634 --> 00:14:43,334
No! No!

304
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:49,484
You did not just do that.

305
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:52,117
Millie, you have to stop.
I've been there, trust me.

306
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,618
How dare you? I thought
you were my friend.

307
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:56,785
I am. Millie, you can't see it now,

308
00:14:56,868 --> 00:14:58,351
but I know what I'm doing.

309
00:14:58,434 --> 00:14:59,484
You don't.

310
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,917
You think you're better than me?

311
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,418
Well, you're not.

312
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:05,017
You're just some washed-up actress

313
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,384
that's too dumb to realize
she's chasing after a boy

314
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:08,818
that has no interest in her.

315
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:12,618
And if you had half a
brain, you'd understand that.

316
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:15,984
Julian doesn't want you in his life,

317
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:17,868
and neither do I.

318
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:27,117
You're coming with me.

319
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,684
I thought we were in a fight.

320
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,785
Well, right now we're
taking a time-out

321
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:32,317
'cause I need my big sister.

322
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,901
Okay.

323
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:47,851
This farm's been in my
family for five generations.

324
00:15:47,934 --> 00:15:49,818
It's nice.

325
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:51,584
Yeah.

326
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:52,917
But how much longer

327
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,067
do you think my dad can
really work this place?

328
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,451
There's a lot riding
on me right now.

329
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:02,050
Hell, I stand to make
more money in the next year

330
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:04,384
than my dad made in his whole life.

331
00:16:04,467 --> 00:16:07,050
But I have one shot at this.

332
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,618
My family has one shot at this.

333
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,701
It's everything.

334
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:12,684
I like you, Clay.

335
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:15,984
And I know that I
said I'd sign with you.

336
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:18,618
But you're an agent
without an agency.

337
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:20,767
And this is my whole life.

338
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:27,234
If you were me, what would you do?

339
00:16:30,234 --> 00:16:33,451
Who did Ken Arthur tell you
he was gonna pair you up with?

340
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,751
Mark Wetton.

341
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:38,484
Well...

342
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:40,584
I'd go with Jim Mitchel.

343
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,300
He'll make a better fit.

344
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:45,868
And, uh...

345
00:16:49,734 --> 00:16:52,234
I'll be seeing you around.

346
00:17:03,734 --> 00:17:05,818
If you're looking for
your partner in crime,

347
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,084
you might want to
try central booking.

348
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:10,084
That's not why I'm here.

349
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:11,950
I know what you're going through.

350
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:13,718
My sister went through it, too.

351
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:15,667
Of course,
she was a lot older than you.

352
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,351
Julian told you?

353
00:17:20,434 --> 00:17:22,651
I can't believe this is happening.

354
00:17:22,734 --> 00:17:24,984
Yeah, he did, but don't
hate on him for that.

355
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:27,117
It's just we talk about everything,

356
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,851
and he told me how much
he wanted to have kids.

357
00:17:29,934 --> 00:17:32,718
So the important thing is
that we get you some help.

358
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:33,785
We?

359
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:35,718
We who?

360
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:37,217
You and Julian?

361
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,334
Yeah.

362
00:17:39,868 --> 00:17:42,151
Well, since the two of
you talk about everything,

363
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:44,689
I'm sure he finally told you
the real reason your script died.

364
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:47,284
What real reason?

365
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,718
Oh...

366
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:52,885
His dad had said that it was
unmakeable with you attached.

367
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:55,334
You are the reason
the project is dead.

368
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:58,618
No. No, that's not true.

369
00:17:58,701 --> 00:17:59,851
It is true.

370
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:02,084
Maybe you should ask
Julian about that

371
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:03,917
next time you talk about everything.

372
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,434
Get out of my store.

373
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,151
You know,
I really need you right now.

374
00:18:45,234 --> 00:18:47,584
It's not fair to hide in my dreams

375
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,800
and not be here when
I need you the most.

376
00:18:52,134 --> 00:18:55,301
Talk to me, Sara.

377
00:19:07,534 --> 00:19:08,684
Jamie's not here.

378
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:10,351
I'm not here to see Jamie.

379
00:19:10,434 --> 00:19:12,051
Then what do you want?

380
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:14,051
I want you to know
before it gets out

381
00:19:14,134 --> 00:19:15,748
that I plan on doing a show
about the day we lost Keith.

382
00:19:15,831 --> 00:19:17,355
You mean the day you killed Keith.

383
00:19:17,438 --> 00:19:20,113
If you're gonna ask for
forgiveness, get it right, Dan.

384
00:19:20,196 --> 00:19:21,863
I don't expect you
to be okay with it.

385
00:19:21,946 --> 00:19:23,120
Just try to keep an open mind.

386
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,989
This show is about helping people.

387
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:25,998
No, no, it's not.

388
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,516
You know what I see when I watch it?

389
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,918
I see a lot of miserable people

390
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:31,151
and you taking their money.

391
00:19:31,234 --> 00:19:32,417
Just try to give it a chance.

392
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,784
A chance?

393
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:36,251
You think after all these years,

394
00:19:36,334 --> 00:19:38,218
I didn't want to believe
that you're a better father

395
00:19:38,301 --> 00:19:39,851
than the man standing
in front of me?

396
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:41,884
I've given you a million chances.

397
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:44,084
And the fact is, if you
ever really helped anyone,

398
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:45,484
if you did just one thing

399
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:47,617
to show that you care
about anyone but yourself,

400
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,817
then maybe.

401
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,984
But I know you, Dan.

402
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:53,251
So...

403
00:19:53,334 --> 00:19:59,034
forgive me,
but I'm all out of chances.

404
00:20:09,401 --> 00:20:11,434
What's up, my boys? Y'all ready?

405
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:14,717
You know the first play, right?

406
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,600
Just get out of eyeline
and someone call "action."

407
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:24,567
Check it, chump.

408
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,550
All right, let's try one.

409
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:29,267
Action!

410
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,533
This just might work.

411
00:20:58,267 --> 00:20:59,484
This will never work.

412
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:00,684
If we go to Spain,

413
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:03,184
then I screw Peyton
and Red Bedroom Records,

414
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:05,450
and if I go on tour, then
Jamie gets homeschooled

415
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:06,817
on a tour bus,

416
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,784
and I don't get to see
my husband for months.

417
00:21:09,867 --> 00:21:12,484
Spain sounds cool. Good margaritas.

418
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:14,051
I think that's Mexico.

419
00:21:14,134 --> 00:21:15,184
What's Spain?

420
00:21:15,267 --> 00:21:17,184
I don't know. Sangria?

421
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:19,784
God, I love sangria.

422
00:21:19,867 --> 00:21:21,684
Really?

423
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:24,951
Okay. I'm sorry. Where were we?

424
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:28,051
I was just saying that of course i
want Jamie and Nathan to be happy,

425
00:21:28,134 --> 00:21:29,600
But I don't want to let Peyton down.

426
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:32,984
See, that's what I love about you.

427
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:35,351
What...
that I can't make up my mind?

428
00:21:35,434 --> 00:21:38,385
No, that you're always worried
about what everyone else wants.

429
00:21:38,468 --> 00:21:41,484
Now I think the most
important question is...

430
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:42,767
What do you want?

431
00:21:44,633 --> 00:21:46,018
So, what do you want?

432
00:21:46,101 --> 00:21:48,417
It's just there's
this big party tonight,

433
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,417
and I was wondering if you could...

434
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,450
I mean... I could score
you some more coke?

435
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:53,567
Yeah.

436
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,450
Bitch, you rock.

437
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:07,884
Well, counting the last few
favors, you owe me 600 bucks.

438
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:10,134
I don't have it right now.

439
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:14,251
Then that's a problem.

440
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,251
But you might have
one thing that I want.

441
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,584
What's that?

442
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:20,285
You know that red dress
that I was supposed to wear

443
00:22:20,368 --> 00:22:22,584
at the Clothes Over Bros show?

444
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:25,784
You get me that dress,
we'll be square.

445
00:22:25,867 --> 00:22:28,285
But that's an unreleased
original from Brooke's new line.

446
00:22:28,368 --> 00:22:30,550
She'd freak if that got
out. I can't give you that.

447
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:32,817
Then I think the weather
report for millieville

448
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,900
is gonna be mostly cloudy with
very little chance of snow.

449
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:43,684
So am I selfish if I
want to go on tour?

450
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:45,051
No.

451
00:22:45,134 --> 00:22:47,251
Am I a bad person if I
give up Red Bedroom Records

452
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:49,084
so I can go to Spain
and be with my husband?

453
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,285
No.

454
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,584
So, what am I supposed to do?

455
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:53,251
You're supposed to help
me make this decision.

456
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:55,817
Okay, look, when we were growing up,

457
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,651
I always depended on you.

458
00:22:57,734 --> 00:23:01,218
I mean, nothing has changed
about that, Haley James.

459
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:03,118
You're an amazing sister.

460
00:23:03,201 --> 00:23:04,751
And the one thing that I do know

461
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:06,951
is that you always make
the right decisions.

462
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:09,651
So if you go to Spain,
you're gonna be good.

463
00:23:09,734 --> 00:23:12,084
And if you go on tour,
you'll be good.

464
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:14,318
Because you're always good, Hales.

465
00:23:14,401 --> 00:23:17,234
You're kind of bad-ass like that.

466
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:20,884
Hey...

467
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:24,851
I'm sorry if I've been
tough on you lately.

468
00:23:24,934 --> 00:23:26,517
I guess there's a part of me

469
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,717
That just wants to
try and fix everything.

470
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,851
Forgive me?

471
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:32,051
I don't know.

472
00:23:32,134 --> 00:23:34,717
Does this mean our
fight is officially over?

473
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,118
I don't know.

474
00:23:36,201 --> 00:23:38,684
I haven't made up my mind yet.

475
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:41,034
Shut up!

476
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:09,151
You either smoke or get smoked.

477
00:24:09,234 --> 00:24:11,368
And you smell like smoke.

478
00:24:25,234 --> 00:24:30,067
Your mom and my game...
they are so phat!

479
00:24:45,301 --> 00:24:46,368
Yes!

480
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:56,751
High five, low five, chest five...

481
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:59,051
Toe five! Boo-Ya!

482
00:24:59,134 --> 00:25:00,567
That's my boy!

483
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:10,918
Brooke, what's wrong?

484
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:14,684
You told Alex that I
can't have children?

485
00:25:14,767 --> 00:25:15,984
Hey...

486
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:18,484
That was personal.

487
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:21,984
That was between me and
you, and you told her?

488
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:23,151
I'm sorry.

489
00:25:23,234 --> 00:25:26,018
It was wrong. I... I just slipped.

490
00:25:26,101 --> 00:25:28,468
How could you do that?

491
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:32,184
Brooke, I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.

492
00:25:32,267 --> 00:25:35,884
You know, what's even
worse than you telling her

493
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,918
is that you told her you want kids.

494
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:43,234
You told her the truth
and you lied to me.

495
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:47,301
Brooke...

496
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:51,867
High five, low five,

497
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,984
chest five, toe five.

498
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:55,517
Boo-Ya!

499
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,717
You did such a good job, Antwon.

500
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,651
You made the kids look so cute.

501
00:26:00,734 --> 00:26:03,151
I think they were
an inspired choice.

502
00:26:03,234 --> 00:26:05,551
You're so getting
this job, Uncle Skills.

503
00:26:05,634 --> 00:26:06,751
It's in the bag now.

504
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:08,118
Yeah, well, if I do,

505
00:26:08,201 --> 00:26:11,218
I'm sure gonna miss you
when I'm kickin' it in Cali.

506
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:12,851
You're moving away?

507
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:14,851
Yeah, well, the job's in L.A.

508
00:26:14,934 --> 00:26:17,984
But you never told me that part.

509
00:26:18,067 --> 00:26:20,384
Oh, I'm sorry, bro.

510
00:26:20,467 --> 00:26:23,018
I mean, it kind of
just happened so fast.

511
00:26:23,101 --> 00:26:24,301
I thought you knew.

512
00:26:40,368 --> 00:26:41,818
I'm not going on tour.

513
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:43,918
I want you to have your dream.

514
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:45,684
I want to show you something.

515
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:46,800
Come here.

516
00:26:51,101 --> 00:26:52,551
What is this?

517
00:26:52,634 --> 00:26:54,450
This is a map of your
tour, but more than that,

518
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:56,684
this is the adventure that
you and Jamie are gonna have

519
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:58,984
while I'm in Spain.

520
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:01,384
See, you got Disneyland in L.A.,

521
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:03,151
the Grand Canyon outside of Phoenix,

522
00:27:03,234 --> 00:27:04,818
and then when you get to Chicago,

523
00:27:04,901 --> 00:27:07,951
there's this really great rib
joint I know Jamie's gonna love.

524
00:27:08,034 --> 00:27:10,984
I got it all figured out...
every stop, every city.

525
00:27:11,067 --> 00:27:13,417
- Nathan...
- And when you guys are done on the tour,

526
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,784
you and Jamie can come to Spain,
see me.

527
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:16,984
See?

528
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:18,617
Now you can have your dream, too.

529
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,684
We should be together.

530
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:23,118
Our family's been through so much.

531
00:27:23,201 --> 00:27:26,051
Do you remember our
anniversary in that old house?

532
00:27:26,134 --> 00:27:29,084
You told me then that you wished
you could go on tour again,

533
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:31,350
and I want you to have that wish.

534
00:27:31,433 --> 00:27:33,151
We should just be us, Hales.

535
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:36,067
If we do that, then I think
everything's gonna turn out fine.

536
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,651
I love you, Nathan Scott.

537
00:27:39,734 --> 00:27:41,433
And I love our little family.

538
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:44,967
I love you, too.

539
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:53,067
Brooke?

540
00:27:54,134 --> 00:27:56,751
It's nothing.

541
00:27:56,834 --> 00:27:58,268
You're crying.

542
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,734
Mom, I can't have kids.

543
00:28:14,634 --> 00:28:16,484
Well, I don't accept it.

544
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:17,918
I just don't.

545
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:20,251
We'll see a specialist...
the best that money can buy.

546
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:21,484
I've been to a specialist.

547
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,884
If there was anything
that could be done,

548
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:26,285
I would be doing it.

549
00:28:26,368 --> 00:28:27,517
Well...

550
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,317
It doesn't mean you
can't have a family.

551
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,350
We'll adopt.

552
00:28:30,433 --> 00:28:32,651
It's not the same.

553
00:28:32,734 --> 00:28:34,767
Yes, it is.

554
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:38,634
I just wanted it so bad.

555
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:42,584
How did Julian take the news?

556
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:46,167
He told Alex he wants kids.

557
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:51,484
Well, maybe he's
not the one for you.

558
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:54,734
But what if I'm the one for him?

559
00:29:03,967 --> 00:29:07,051
I'm sorry I made you sad, man.

560
00:29:07,134 --> 00:29:09,151
But it ain't no big thing.

561
00:29:09,234 --> 00:29:11,084
I mean, just because I'm in L.A.,

562
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,617
that don't mean we won't
get to see each other.

563
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,667
Like I see uncle Lucas?

564
00:29:17,467 --> 00:29:20,517
I know it's hard for you
to understand right now...

565
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,784
but sometimes us adults,

566
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:25,584
we have to do certain
things that we don't like.

567
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:28,167
I mean, it's just part
of being a grown-up.

568
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,484
And even though he's gone,

569
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:34,001
your uncle Lucas
loves you very much.

570
00:29:35,268 --> 00:29:36,617
You know how I know that?

571
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,751
No. How?

572
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:41,218
Because I love you, too.

573
00:29:41,301 --> 00:29:44,317
So you won't forget
about me in L.A.?

574
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,001
Never.

575
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:50,251
And maybe when you're older,

576
00:29:50,334 --> 00:29:52,334
you can come stay with me in Cali.

577
00:29:55,268 --> 00:29:57,617
'cause I'll always be your Denzel.

578
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,918
And I'll always be your Macaulay,

579
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:02,201
but I'm never leaving Tree Hill.

580
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:08,218
I said I was leaving.

581
00:30:08,301 --> 00:30:09,450
What do you mean?

582
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:10,684
What happened with the quarterback?

583
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,884
Nothing.

584
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:15,851
And you know what? He's right.

585
00:30:15,934 --> 00:30:19,717
I have no business
jeopardizing a kid's career.

586
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,500
I'm not an agent. I'm a liability.

587
00:30:23,934 --> 00:30:25,051
In six months,

588
00:30:25,134 --> 00:30:26,551
I'll just be the cautionary tale

589
00:30:26,634 --> 00:30:29,951
they talk about at company retreats.

590
00:30:30,034 --> 00:30:33,001
So that's it?
You're just running away?

591
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:36,767
Do you think Sara
would let you quit?

592
00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:40,717
What do you think she'd say?

593
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Nothing.

594
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:45,901
Sara's dead.

595
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:54,984
You know, when I said I
was staying, I'm staying...

596
00:30:55,067 --> 00:30:56,667
Clay!

597
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:01,867
I guess I'll see you.

598
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:29,417
Mr. Scott.

599
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,151
Could I please trouble you for...

600
00:31:33,234 --> 00:31:35,118
For an autograph. Sure. No problem.

601
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:37,784
Is there something special
you wanted me to say?

602
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:40,751
You don't know who I am, do you?

603
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:42,268
I'm sorry, I meet a lot of...

604
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:48,651
How dare you profit from
the death of my Jimmy!

605
00:31:48,734 --> 00:31:54,185
You let everyone believe
that he was a murderer.

606
00:31:54,268 --> 00:31:57,984
I had to bury him alone...

607
00:31:58,067 --> 00:32:00,384
alone and ashamed.

608
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:05,167
And you have the nerve
to talk about forgiveness.

609
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:11,717
Well, I just came
here today to tell you

610
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,084
that you will never
find forgiveness with me.

611
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:17,034
Never.

612
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,034
Where's a camera crew
when you really need one?

613
00:32:38,334 --> 00:32:40,450
There you are.

614
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:42,251
Good. You took what I said to heart.

615
00:32:42,334 --> 00:32:44,051
I was worried you'd be too ashamed

616
00:32:44,134 --> 00:32:45,684
to show your face around here.

617
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:48,350
No. I'm really sorry
about last night.

618
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,317
Now that Alex is gone,

619
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,285
a lot is riding on you, Millicent.

620
00:32:53,368 --> 00:32:55,567
You're the face we're
putting out into the world.

621
00:32:57,368 --> 00:32:58,867
Brooke is counting on you.

622
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:05,001
Don't mess it up.

623
00:33:16,201 --> 00:33:17,517
What the hell was that?

624
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,285
I asked you not to say anything,

625
00:33:19,368 --> 00:33:21,751
and you marched right over
there the first chance you got.

626
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,051
I never should have trusted you.

627
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:24,285
I was just trying to help.

628
00:33:24,368 --> 00:33:25,918
- Help?
- What... you call that help?

629
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:27,185
Because of you right now,

630
00:33:27,268 --> 00:33:28,951
Brooke and I aren't even talking.

631
00:33:29,034 --> 00:33:30,517
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.

632
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,584
What's that supposed to mean?

633
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:34,551
It means I can give
you everything you want,

634
00:33:34,634 --> 00:33:35,951
and Brooke can't.

635
00:33:36,034 --> 00:33:37,751
Okay, I thought we
covered this ground

636
00:33:37,834 --> 00:33:39,118
after your last text,

637
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:40,984
which, by the way, you
said was a big mistake.

638
00:33:41,067 --> 00:33:42,667
Maybe I lied...

639
00:33:44,134 --> 00:33:46,084
because I love you.

640
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:48,684
And deep down inside,
I know you love me, too.

641
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:52,018
Alex, let me be perfectly clear.

642
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:53,867
I do not love you.

643
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,118
I don't even like you.

644
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,051
- Julian, don't.
- Alex, this is goodbye.

645
00:33:59,134 --> 00:34:00,218
But you like me.

646
00:34:00,301 --> 00:34:01,517
You said I was talented.

647
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,400
Well, maybe I lied.

648
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,151
Brooke told me about the movie...

649
00:34:07,234 --> 00:34:09,517
the real reason it didn't sell.

650
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,551
It was because of me, huh?

651
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:14,751
So it's true, then?

652
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:17,484
That nobody wants me?

653
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:19,800
Yes.

654
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:31,561
Millie, I've been
looking all over for you.

655
00:34:31,644 --> 00:34:33,131
Didn't you get my calls, my texts?

656
00:34:33,214 --> 00:34:35,851
- My phone died. Sorry, I have to go.
- Millie.

657
00:34:36,434 --> 00:34:38,284
You can't go.

658
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,423
I wasn't asking you,
Marvin. I was telling you.

659
00:34:41,267 --> 00:34:41,773
Hey!

660
00:34:42,075 --> 00:34:43,452
You need help, okay?

661
00:34:43,535 --> 00:34:45,523
You have a problem,
and you need real help.

662
00:34:45,606 --> 00:34:47,698
My only problem is you.

663
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:49,851
Millicent.

664
00:34:52,547 --> 00:34:54,623
If you walk out that door,
don't bother coming back.

665
00:34:54,706 --> 00:34:55,549
Do you understand me?

666
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:14,422
You okay?

667
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:17,628
No.

668
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,051
But worse than that, we're not okay.

669
00:35:22,134 --> 00:35:25,418
You should have never stayed here.

670
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:29,051
Being here means you
have to give things up,

671
00:35:29,134 --> 00:35:32,851
and I am tired of making
you give things up...

672
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:36,584
L.A., work, Alex, and now...

673
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:39,184
Brooke,
I don't care about having kids.

674
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:41,967
That's not true, and you know it.

675
00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:45,784
You want all that...

676
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:48,517
and you should have it.

677
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,568
I don't want to be the girl
that keeps denying it from you.

678
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,385
I think you should
take another movie.

679
00:35:57,468 --> 00:36:00,485
And what about us?

680
00:36:00,568 --> 00:36:03,184
What are you really saying?

681
00:36:03,267 --> 00:36:06,751
I'm saying I need some time...

682
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:08,468
Apart.

683
00:36:51,267 --> 00:36:52,884
Hi.

684
00:36:52,967 --> 00:36:54,550
You were Clay Evans'
assistant, right?

685
00:36:54,633 --> 00:36:56,218
That's right.

686
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:58,767
I was wondering if
you could help me.

687
00:37:06,534 --> 00:37:07,951
Hello?

688
00:37:08,034 --> 00:37:09,717
What are you wearing right now?

689
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,184
Are you kidding me?
That's the worst line ever.

690
00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:13,617
Where are you?

691
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,951
I'm just trying to
get an early start

692
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:18,468
on this whole
long-distance romance thing.

693
00:37:20,201 --> 00:37:22,650
It's gonna be all right
leaving Tree Hill, right?

694
00:37:22,733 --> 00:37:23,784
Tell me it's okay.

695
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,485
It's gonna be okay. I promise.

696
00:37:25,568 --> 00:37:27,318
And you think Jamie will understand?

697
00:37:27,401 --> 00:37:30,134
- He'll be fine.
- All right?

698
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:48,733
Driver, let's go.

699
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:58,018
I don't want to do the show.

700
00:37:58,101 --> 00:37:59,385
I'm done.

701
00:37:59,468 --> 00:38:01,334
You're funny.

702
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:07,700
This is your end.

703
00:38:09,301 --> 00:38:11,151
It's enough for you to start over.

704
00:38:11,234 --> 00:38:12,650
You have your whole
life ahead of you.

705
00:38:12,733 --> 00:38:15,351
But we're just getting started.

706
00:38:15,434 --> 00:38:18,151
Do you have any idea how
big this is going to be?

707
00:38:18,234 --> 00:38:20,550
How much is enough, Rachel?

708
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:22,784
Give me the number
that'll make you happy.

709
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,101
You're serious.

710
00:38:25,401 --> 00:38:26,717
Are you trying to
get rid of me, Dan?

711
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,884
No, of course not.

712
00:38:28,967 --> 00:38:30,851
I just want to stop.

713
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:33,485
We can run away and
just live our lives.

714
00:38:33,568 --> 00:38:35,184
We can grow old together.

715
00:38:35,267 --> 00:38:36,568
You're already old.

716
00:38:38,867 --> 00:38:40,884
What we have is enough.

717
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:43,800
It will never be enough.

718
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:47,584
And I shouldn't have to remind you

719
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:49,617
that, as your wife,
I'm entitled to half.

720
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,101
You're missing a few zeros.

721
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,385
Of course, when that
clock stops running,

722
00:38:55,468 --> 00:38:56,501
I'm entitled to all of it.

723
00:38:58,367 --> 00:39:00,684
It's gonna be a great show, honey.

724
00:39:00,767 --> 00:39:03,101
We always give them a great show.

725
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:11,151
Get lost!

726
00:39:11,234 --> 00:39:12,401
They got guns!

727
00:39:16,633 --> 00:39:19,550
The sizzle reel is
officially in L.A.

728
00:39:19,633 --> 00:39:21,851
I just uploaded it.

729
00:39:21,934 --> 00:39:23,751
You think I'll get the job?

730
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:25,717
Yeah, I do. You deserve it.

731
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,784
Yeah, but you know I couldn't
have done it without you, right?

732
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:29,251
Yeah.

733
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:31,550
So, how'd everything go with Millie?

734
00:39:31,633 --> 00:39:33,684
Not good.

735
00:39:33,767 --> 00:39:35,517
Really bad, actually.

736
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,667
Can you fix it?

737
00:39:39,134 --> 00:39:40,434
I don't think so.

738
00:39:41,733 --> 00:39:44,000
I'm sorry, bro.

739
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:47,884
So, promise me right now

740
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:50,667
that if I get this job in
L.A., you'll go with me.

741
00:39:58,234 --> 00:40:00,284
Don't even leave me hangin, Dawg.

742
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:01,884
Okay.

743
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:02,867
Deal.

744
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:05,434
My man.

745
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:53,318
Hey, this is Julian.

746
00:40:53,401 --> 00:40:54,617
Here comes the...

747
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,018
I'm just calling to
tell you how sorry I am

748
00:40:57,101 --> 00:40:59,351
for all the trouble
that I've caused you,

749
00:40:59,434 --> 00:41:00,951
but you don't have to worry

750
00:41:01,034 --> 00:41:03,767
'cause from now on, I won't be
around to cause you any pain.

751
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:07,717
And in spite of everything
that you said to me,

752
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,301
I will always love you.

753
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,000
Goodbye.
