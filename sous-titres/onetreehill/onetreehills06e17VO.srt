1
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,110
I'm having your baby. Lucas Scott.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,320
I love you.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,330
I just want to run some tests.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,790
I thought I was in charge of the school
paper and had final say on what went in it.

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:13,610
You do.

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,170
And I have final say on whether or not you work here.

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,760
That was the Charleston chiefs.

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,410
You're looking at their newest point guard.

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,410
I had sex last night.

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,470
It was a mistake.

11
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,150
It was supposed to be you.

12
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,040
I know.

13
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,860
Brooke says she needs a buyer in New York for costumes.

14
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,380
Maybe I should go.

15
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,280
I think that might be best.

16
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,500
What's that. Grandpa?

17
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,370
That's the thing that makes noise when it's time for me to get better.

18
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,100
I want you to have this.

19
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,470
It means we're going steady.

20
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:48,700
This is so wrong... but it's... so right.

21
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:56,970
You need to go.

22
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,980
Why? What did I do?

23
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,590
You know what you did.

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,780
Most girls like that.

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,500
Well not me.

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,940
I'm gonna take a shower.

27
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,350
And when I get out. I want you gone.

28
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,200
I don't understand why it's such a big deal.

29
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,720
Because I don't do that!

30
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,160
I'm a mother for God's sakes.

31
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,060
Look Brooke. I'm sorry. It won't happen again. Okay?

32
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,890
Really. I promise.

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,220
You promise?

34
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,190
I promise

35
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,380
Okay you caught me a little off guard there.

36
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,390
Understandable. I'm sorry.

37
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,870
I'm sorry I freaked out.

38
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,130
Just as long as it doesn't happen again.

39
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,500
You have my word. Never again will I say the words "I love you."

40
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,410
Even though I do in fact love you.

41
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,810
I love you. I love you. I love you.

42
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,370
Quit it!

43
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,250
Millie?

44
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,160
Marvin.

45
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,430
What are you doing here?

46
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,320
Picking up the rest of my stuff. I'm sorry.

47
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,740
I talked to Skills. He said you'd be at work all day.

48
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,200
That's funny.

49
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,260
Skills told me to be here all day to wait for the cable guy.

50
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,500
Now I'm thinking he just unplugged the cable.

51
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,570
So, how's New York?

52
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,260
It's nice.

53
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,800
I missed it. It's a really exciting place to be.

54
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,510
That's good.

55
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,470
You know things have been pretty exciting in Tree Hill.

56
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,050
People are losing their minds over this movie business.

57
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,280
And I met the guy who's playing me.

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,180
It's totally weird.

59
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,330
I could have sent that to you.

60
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,820
I came to get my car. I'm driving it back.

61
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,570
I thought the whole point of New York was that you didn't need a car.

62
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,200
Yeah but I've decided to stay on a more permanent basis.

63
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,480
So... I guess this is goodbye for a while then.

64
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,480
Actually it's goodbye forever.

65
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,980
Hello?

66
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,460
Anybody home?

67
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,110
Geez! Haley.

68
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,690
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

69
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,180
You know bad hearts run in my family.

70
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,700
I know. It's a good thing I know cpr.

71
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,630
What is this?

72
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,940
You send me a cryptic text telling me
to meet you at this strange address.

73
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,290
What have you been doing in Charleston?

74
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,080
What do you think? Have we ever spent this day apart?

75
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,310
No.

76
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,770
Come on.

77
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,580
You couldn't come home this weekend

78
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,850
so I just decided to bring home to you.

79
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,070
Happy anniversary Nathan Scott.

80
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,410
Since it's just you and me tonight

81
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:09,330
I am going to let you stay up past
bedtime and watch "Thomas & friends."

82
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,040
 I'd rather watch "Gossip girl."

83
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,860
It's so bad for me.

84
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,490
Keep dreaming. Okay you're pretty good at math

85
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,250
so I'm guessing Orval is joining us again for dinner.

86
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,630
If he even touches my pepperoni

87
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,090
I will kick his imaginary butt.

88
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,100
Easy nanny Deb.

89
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,610
It's not for Orval.

90
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,510
That was fast. The pizza's here.

91
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,050
Hello Deb.

92
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,820
You're looking... old.

93
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,510
Grandpa Dan!

94
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,430
There's my guy.

95
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,100
What do you wantDan?

96
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,700
I invited him.

97
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,580
Don't you know there's a rule about letting pregnant women lie?

98
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,700
Is that "lie" as in "sleep" or "lie" as in.

99
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,870
"of course you're the baby's father"?

100
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,730
No. It's "lie" as in "sleep." but that too.

101
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,380
You know you're gonna feel really bad
about that when you see my surprise.

102
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,650
Really?

103
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,600
Has the surprise anything to do with the
reason you didn't come to bed last night?

104
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,150
Maybe.

105
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,520
You ready to have your world rocked?

106
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,610
Not so much.

107
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,460
You got morning sickness again.

108
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,800
Yeah sure.

109
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,460
You okay?

110
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,440
Let's get you to bed.

111
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,790
The doctor said you need to take it easy.

112
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,830
I want to see the surprise.

113
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,700
It's not a good idea.

114
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,320
I want to see it.

115
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,800
Peyton...

116
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,870
Like you said this is our house now.

117
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,500
It's beautiful.

118
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,410
Peyton...
I'm just gonna need a minute.

119
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,120
We haven't even picked out names yet.

120
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,010
I was thinking "Anna."

121
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,150
"Anna" for a little girl after my mom.

122
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,040
Come on.

123
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,200
Don't.
Or maybe.

124
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,650
um... maybe "Sawyer" for a boy... Sawyer Scott.

125
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,420
We need to take a couple days and process this okay?

126
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,070
When I think about all the time I thought maybe I didn't want a baby

127
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,120
like I... like I couldn't handle it...

128
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,370
Peyton, it doesn't work like that.

129
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,340
The universe doesn't punish you for being afraid.

130
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,560
I know. I know.

131
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,170
But I can't do it.

132
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,700
Listen the doctor... 
I know what he said.

133
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,970
If you have this baby... you could die.

134
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,440
It doesn't matter.

135
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,880
I'm gonna have this baby.

136
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,820
The doctor didn't say something could happen to you.

137
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,040
He said there was a very good chance.

138
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,000
Peyton he said we could lose the baby anyway.

139
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,090
Look, we... we don't have to make this decision now okay?

140
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,880
We can...take a couple days before we go back in.

141
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,360
Okay?

142
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,540
For an abortion.

143
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,150
That is not what the doctor called it.

144
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,320
That's what it is.

145
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,540
Look, nobody is gonna say... 
That's what it is!

146
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,650
Okay. If you would like to talk about it

147
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,930
then call it what it is.

148
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,390
How could this happen in a month?

149
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,430
I had some pain early in the pregnancy.

150
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,450
Why didn't you tell me that?

151
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,710
'Cause I didn't want you to worry

152
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,750
and they said it was nothing.

153
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,340
This isn't nothing.

154
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,810
Maybe it is.

155
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,650
What does that mean?

156
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,370
Well it means whatever happens, happens.

157
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,090
That is really selfish you know that?

158
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,040
Excuse me?

159
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,330
Okay fine! You want me to be the bad guy?!

160
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,320
Fine.We'll call it what you want.

161
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,460
But if continuing this pregnancy
means I lose you... then we end it.

162
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,540
It's not an "it.

163
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,060
Luke, this is our baby.

164
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,800
All right? You... you saw its heartbeat. 

165
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,090
You saw its little tiny fingers and its toes.

166
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,440
Stop it! Stop it!
No. I'm not gonna stop it!

167
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,670
I want you to think about it okay?

168
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,990
Well then we'll try again okay?

169
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,740
Okay? We can adopt okay?

170
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,600
I mean, if your parents never would have adopted

171
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,780
we never would have met.

172
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,660
I know. I know honey. And I love you for that.

173
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,300
But this little life inside of me... it's you

174
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,510
and it's me.

175
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,520
And I want him to have your goofy squint

176
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,470
and I want her to have my chickeny legs.

177
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,770
I don't need this kid to look like me.

178
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,700
I don't care about that.

179
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,040
I care... about this child growing up without a mother.

180
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,890
Look what it did to you.

181
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,600
You are really trying to guilt me into this.

182
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,140
Hell yes I am.

183
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,200
That is exactly what I'm gonna do if

184
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,130
in the end it keeps you alive.

185
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,700
You are such a dick.

186
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,630
Well. Then fine I'm a dick.

187
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,160
What are you doing?

188
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,100
It was too soon.

189
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,280
Stop it!

190
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,330
Lucas Eugene Scott if you don't stop it right now

191
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,240
I will beat your ass!

192
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,820
You sound like a mom.

193
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,990
I am a mom.

194
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,100
A while back. I had a dream... that something happened to you.

195
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,570
It got me to thinking about my life without you

196
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:51,010
and I... I can't...

197
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,120
No. I can't live that life. I can't.

198
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,940
You talk about how I'm always saving you

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,850
Peyton and I can't save you from this.

200
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,920
We can't even think like that, okay?

201
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,280
Will you just please look at all the stuff you and I have survived together?

202
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,150
I mean, car crashes and bullet wounds and psychos.

203
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,280
Are we really gonna let some doctor lay odds on us?

204
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,980
And okay.

205
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,030
Even if something does happen to me

206
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,740
you're gonna be okay.

207
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,640
And you can raise this baby on your own

208
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,030
just like your mom did.

209
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,790
And how am I supposed to feel about
the child that took you away from me?

210
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,810
God. I don't worry about that for a second

211
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,220
because you are not that person.

212
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,140
And you will never, ever, ever be on your own.

213
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:45,610
You have Nathan and Haley and... Brooke.

214
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:54,390
And just think about all that sexy Jake
Jagielski single-dad tail you're gonna rake in.

215
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,900
Not funny.

216
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,270
I'm sorry. It's not funny.

217
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,810
Because I would haunt your ass just
to make sure you never had sex again.

218
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,130
How can you joke about this?

219
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,410
'Cause I'm scared.

220
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,530
Ttaught me to believe in fate.

221
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,490
I mean, that's what "The comet" is all about, right?

222
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,340
It's about accepting your fate.

223
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,930
How can this be fate?

224
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,610
Maybe it is.

225
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:29,600
Maybe... maybe the whole point of you and me

226
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,810
and every single moment that we've shared together

227
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,440
has just been leading us here.

228
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,930
Maybe you and I are meant to create this life

229
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,400
because maybe this life is gonna change the world.

230
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,130
I can't accept that our story doesn't have a good ending.

231
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,800
Our story already has the greatest ending.

232
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,530
No matter what.

233
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,330
'Cause we're together.

234
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,090
I need to know we're making the right choice.

235
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,980
I just... What?

236
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,260
Okay c... c... come... come here. Sit down. Sit down.

237
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,880
I'll call an ambulance.

238
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:18,550
No. Wait. He's kicking hard.

239
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,420
Do you feel that?!

240
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,820
Yeah.

241
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,650
It is okay for you to love this baby.

242
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,190
It doesn't mean you don't love me.

243
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,330
I can't live without you Peyton.

244
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,830
Honey you don't have to,

245
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,500
and you're not going to.

246
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,530
I know it. I can feel it.

247
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,690
We are gonna live happily ever after

248
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,370
all three of us.

249
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,910
Millicent wait.

250
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,880
Wait for what Marvin?

251
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,940
What else is there to say after goodbye?

252
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,900
You're not wearing your glasses.

253
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,560
I had Lasik.

254
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,560
I see 20/20 now.

255
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,780
Well. I guess it was a month of firsts.

256
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:28,100
Okay. If you're done making fun of me.

257
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,220
I have a long drive.
Hang on. That was mean.

258
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,640
I... I was angry.

259
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,480
Maybe I still am a little.

260
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,480
Trust me... there's nothing you can say that
I haven't said to myself a thousand times.

261
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,540
Well, maybe there's one thing.

262
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,280
I'm sorry.

263
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,330
What are you sorry for?

264
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,570
For driving you away.

265
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,810
It's my cellphone bill.

266
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,330
It's $300.

267
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,920
Text-messaging fees.

268
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,150
Most of those were texts from Gigi

269
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,290
and a lot of them were my replies.

270
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,940
Why are you doing this?

271
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,060
It's cruel.

272
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,560
I'm not trying to be cruel Millie.

273
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,520
I'm doing this because you're the one who deserves to be angry

274
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,890
and you need to know that you didn't screw this up.

275
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,700
I did.

276
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:21,920
And I didn't even really realize how wrong it
was until I saw it there in black and white.

277
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,070
Why did you do it?

278
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,510
I don't know. Maybe I... 

279
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,550
maybe I got some kind of rush out of it.

280
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,800
I can't give you a reason that won't sound like an excuse.

281
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,490
But if I'd never gone down that road

282
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,020
then you never would have... you know.

283
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:46,480
So before you walk out of my life...
I need to know if you can forgive me.

284
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,300
That's really noble Marvin but, you're a guy,

285
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,990
you have needs.

286
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,710
Gigi made you feel special in a way that I obviously couldn't.

287
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,280
That is not true.

288
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,960
You made me feel special every single day.

289
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,510
But never at night.

290
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,180
All those nights we slept beside each other,

291
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:11,830
there were so many times I'd lie awake watching you sleep
and I'd just want to rip your clothes off and attack you.

292
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,250
Why didn't you?

293
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,930
I was scared...

294
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,170
that what we had was so special that sex would mess it up.

295
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,650
That the promise of it could never live up to the real thing.

296
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:29,010
But now I realize that our relationship wasn't that special.

297
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,440
Don't say that. We were amazing together Millie.

298
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,610
And... I know we can be amazing together again.

299
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,970
The mistakes we made will always be there between us.

300
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:48,540
But maybe if we start over... maybe the past
won't be there in our next relationships.

301
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,830
So the mistakes go away but we're with the wrong people.

302
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,150
We can't just go back to being Mouth and Millie.

303
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,910
I don't want to go back. I want to go forward... being this version of us.

304
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,560
What do you mean?

305
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,090
I mean, things were always so easy between us before

306
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,950
but this is real life.

307
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,460
Yes, we made mistakes. We screwed up.

308
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,080
Maybe we can be that couple that finds
our way through it to something better... 

309
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,950
something we both know is worth fighting for and protecting.

310
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,010
I... I don't have all the answers.

311
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,560
Millie. I just... I know that I miss you.

312
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,810
What do you miss about me?

313
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,620
I miss knowing that my day was gonna start with you,

314
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,650
knowing that I was gonna come home
to the one person who really got me.

315
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,560
I miss the fact that around 2:30 every morning

316
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,130
you snore for exactly seven minutes.

317
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,920
I do not.

318
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:45,240
And I miss... I miss the glasses.

319
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,160
The glasses aren't coming back Marvin.

320
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,530
I can't rewind the clock and take any of it back.

321
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,570
I know that.

322
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,580
But I didn't love you for your glasses.

323
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,770
I love you for you.

324
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,360
I love you too Marvin.

325
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,490
But it's not just about you forgiving me.

326
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,550
I have to forgive myself

327
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,770
and I can't do that if I'm seeing you every day.

328
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,240
I have to go.

329
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,720
Or you could stay.

330
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,040
I'm sorry.

331
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,070
To seven years.

332
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,350
Seven years.

333
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,800
I can't believe you talked me into marrying you when I was 16.

334
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,180
I know. What the hell was I thinking?

335
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,960
That's like Jamie bringing home a wife in 10 years.

336
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,060
Stop it.

337
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,340
That is  so not gonna happen.

338
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,440
We'd totally be hypocrites.

339
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,340
That's true.

340
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,220
Where is the boy anyway?

341
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,270
Your mom's watching him for the night.

342
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,150
And who's gonna watch him when we
do a dime for breaking and entering?

343
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,540
Don't be such a wuss.

344
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,870
I've got everything figured out.

345
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,310
Time for fortune cookies.

346
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,130
Okay. Okay.

347
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,720
"You are a master of your craft"

348
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,810
in bed. Now, that is true.

349
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,470
It does not say that.

350
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,980
No but you can add "in bed" to the end of any fortune

351
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,170
and it works.

352
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,690
What?
It works every time.

353
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,030
Try it. Try it.

354
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,830
Where do you come up with these things?

355
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,440
"Prepare yourself for a big change,"

356
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,520
in bed. Well

357
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,150
you know what they say about the seven-year itch.

358
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,940
Fortune cookies suck.

359
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,740
It got the "change" part right.

360
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,050
I know the last couple weeks have been
hard on you... taking care of Jamie,

361
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,350
working full time.

362
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,010
Yeah, that's kind of what I meant.

363
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,000
Um... listen,

364
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:19,230
uh... I haven't exactly been working full time.

365
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,310
What? Why not?

366
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,240
It's just like, uh, you know.

367
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:27,210
I consider it a vacation... an unpaid one that may never end.

368
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,470
Haley, what the hell happened?

369
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,750
You know that paper I told you about that Sam wrote for school?

370
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:37,000
Yeah.
It was incredible and important and maybe a little pg-13.

371
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,660
and Principal Rimkus told me I couldn't publish it in the school paper.

372
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,630
So of course you did.

373
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,970
Yeah.

374
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,550
Are you mad?

375
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,800
Yeah... at Principal Buttkiss.

376
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,880
That's very original.
Thank you.

377
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,790
Anyway she suspended me,

378
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,450
so... but it got me thinking

379
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,680
you know, about where we're headed and just the bigger picture.

380
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,920
And?

381
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:09,310
Well, for instance...what do you think if Jamie and I come here?

382
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,210
You want to move to Charleston?

383
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,420
I know. It's totally crazy, right?

384
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,860
But on the other hand

385
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,950
you're gonna be spending a lot more
time here than you will be in Tree Hill.

386
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,840
Next you're gonna tell me that we already bought this house.

387
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,010
No.

388
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,640
But the realtor is a friend of a friend in case we wanted to check it out.

389
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,890
You are just full of surprises tonight.

390
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,820
I'm just getting started.

391
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,440
This place is practically falling apart. It must be dirt-cheap.

392
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,830
I think it's beautiful.

393
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,130
It kind of reminds me of the old Granville house in "it's a wonderful life."

394
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,720
You know... the one George and Mary used to throw rocks at and make wishes.

395
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,510
See? Isn't this perfect?

396
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,950
Jamie would love it.

397
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,020
Chester would love it.

398
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,860
I'm sure this place comes with things that could eat Chester.

399
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,940
Come on.

400
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,600
This could be my music studio!

401
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:12,090
Oh, and... it happens to overlook
the driveway with a basketball hoop.

402
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,300
So whenever I need inspiration

403
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,650
I can watch you play... shirtless.

404
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,750
I mean, you just got this all figured out, don't you?

405
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,520
Well, I'm just dreaming.

406
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,460
Baby, Tree Hill's always gonna be our home.

407
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,830
And I don't want to leave forever.

408
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,430
But at the same time,

409
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,640
we never said we'd stay forever.

410
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,430
Okay.

411
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,890
You want to dream.

412
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,900
Let's dream big.

413
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,220
You should get back to your music,

414
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,970
but I'm not talking about writing songs in some creaky.,

415
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,540
old house.

416
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,510
You should get back on the road.

417
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,860
Yeah like that's ever gonna happen.

418
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,690
I saw that look in your eyes after that U.S.O. show.

419
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,700
You get the same rush from the crowd that I do.

420
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,760
And one attention whore per family is enough,

421
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,250
don't you think?

422
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,060
We could make it work.

423
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,560
Like we did last time?

424
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,540
We are not the same couple we
were then. We're much stronger now.

425
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,830
We also have a child to think about.

426
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,200
He has school.

427
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,950
It's a good thing his mom is the world's greatest teacher,

428
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,620
whose speciality is tutoring Scott boys.

429
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,930
I don't know baby.

430
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,030
A different city every night?

431
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,810
Living out of a bus?

432
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,820
What kind of a life would that be for him?

433
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,310
It's the kind of life most kids dream of.

434
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,720
I'll tell you what. Come here.

435
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,740
Pretend like we're outside right now throwing rocks at this house.

436
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,190
You tell me your wish wouldn't be to go back on tour.

437
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,400
It would.

438
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,990
I knew it.

439
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:42,980
Nathan.

440
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,830
We would have totally separate lives.

441
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,050
What would that mean for us?

442
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,550
Phone sex.

443
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,370
I'm serious.

444
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,860
This is our marriage. You can't take those kind of chances with marriage.

445
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,280
You got to play defense,

446
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,960
do you know who you're talking to?

447
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,830
Have you seen my defensive stats?

448
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,210
Look.

449
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,950
There's only a couple of things that I'm certain of in life

450
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,690
and one of them is that.

451
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,230
No matter what happens

452
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,860
you're gonna be the one wheeling me around when I'm 80.

453
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,550
Besides. I just...

454
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,500
I couldn't live with myself knowing that
my dream kept you from pursuing yours.

455
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,150
You're so amazing.

456
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,110
I know. You got lucky.

457
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,890
Think about it will you?

458
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,540
Yeah. I'll think about it.

459
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,920
Besides what do you want with an old house like this?

460
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,940
There's too many rooms.

461
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,610
You forgot how much fun we're gonna have filling them up with kids.

462
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,500
Really?

463
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,110
All these rooms?
All of them. It's a big house.

464
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,310
Apparently you missed the part about me wanting you gone.

465
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,360
What are you still doing here?

466
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,580
I didn't know you dated Ryan Reynolds.

467
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,970
What are you talking about?

468
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,210
Where did you get that?

469
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,370
This website. It's called whosdatedwho.com.

470
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,030
It lists everyone you've dated for the past five years.

471
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,930
They can't do that!

472
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:24,470
You're a public figure. The rules of common decency don't apply.

473
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,230
But this is all wrong. I never dated him.

474
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,320
I never even met him.

475
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,930
Well yeah, I would have dated her,

476
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,140
but no.

477
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,670
Colin Farrell, nice.

478
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,260
Remind me to get tested.

479
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,370
Very funny.

480
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,990
You can't believe everything you read on the internet.

481
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,600
Yeah but even if you can believe half of it

482
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:46,150
the sheer volume... wow.

483
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,620
Okay.

484
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,250
Playtime's over.

485
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,710
Six hours of battery life sweetheart.

486
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,700
Why are you doing this?

487
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,230
Because I'm trying to figure out why
you got so freaked out about what I said.

488
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,840
By examining my ex list?

489
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,150
So I dated a few guys in New York. So what?

490
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,860
You weren't in love with any of them?

491
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,420
I didn't have time for love okay?

492
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,190
And even if I had Victoria would have never allowed it.

493
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,150
So there it is.

494
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:20,730
So then the last time you were in love...

495
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,390
Now I get it.

496
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:26,750
Yeah. It was a long time ago.

497
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:29,740
Where are you going?

498
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,850
If you have more than one copy of Lucas' book

499
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:32,870
I'm out of here.

500
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,010
Look I'm sorry if it's weird for you.

501
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,090
You still love him?

502
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,940
No. I don't.
Yeah.

503
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,170
That's what Peyton said.

504
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,980
First of all.

505
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:50,320
Peyton fed me that story long before she told it to you,

506
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,420
so I've been there.

507
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,610
And second, I love her, but I'm not Peyton.

508
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,620
I'm sorry. It's just that I've already been in a relationship

509
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,440
that had the stench of Lucas Scott hanging over it.

510
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,710
And how do you think I feel?

511
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,540
I'm the girl who's dating the guy who came
to town in the first place to get Peyton back.

512
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,180
Okay not exactly true,

513
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,020
but... point taken.

514
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,230
Yeah.

515
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,060
It sucks always being the footnote in someone else's love story.

516
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,300
But you're right you know. You're not Peyton.

517
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:26,410
Lucas and Peyton's story is all about romance and destiny and fate.

518
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,620
But you're different.

519
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,020
Um... thanks?

520
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,400
Brooke Davis writes her own story

521
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:36,350
like you did with your career and your company and with Sam.

522
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,360
You choose your own path.

523
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,430
Yeah.

524
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,530
But you can't choose who you love.

525
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,910
You're right. You don't.

526
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,820
But you choose whether or not you open your heart to love.

527
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,300
What do you want me to say?

528
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:02,140
How about "I love you too Julian"?

529
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:08,200
How about. "I like you a lot"?

530
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,080
This is all happening really fast.

531
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,650
What happened to just having fun?

532
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,400
And you know it's not as simple for me.

533
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,770
I have Sam to think about.

534
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,560
Don't do that.
What?

535
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,940
Don't hide behind Sam.

536
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:21,270
I'm not hiding.
Yes you are.

537
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,110
And you want to know what I think?

538
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:28,870
I think you do love me... or you could love me... 
but you're just too stubborn and scared to admit it

539
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,200
because the last time you really gave your heart to someone

540
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,310
it got broken.

541
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,000
And I get that.

542
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,540
I've been there.

543
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,770
But somewhere along the line

544
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:41,550
you gave up on the idea that you deserve to feel this way again.

545
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,760
But you don't see what I see Brooke.

546
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,290
You deserve this.

547
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:53,180
So I'm gonna try one more time.

548
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,680
I love you.

549
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,850
I'm in love with you.

550
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,430
I'm so lost and completely in love with you.

551
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,980
I have been ever since I saw you doing
that ridiculous molly ringwald dance.

552
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,280
Julian...

553
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:22,200
I... I care about you so much.

554
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,880
Never let it be said that Brooke Davis is easy.

555
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,050
Julian.

556
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,210
I'm sorry.

557
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,100
That wasn't fair.

558
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,720
You know what?

559
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:47,580
It's okay. Someday you'll let someone in. Today's just not that day.

560
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,220
I don't want this to change anything.

561
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,000
No it won't. It won't.

562
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,480
You know you were right. It's my fault.

563
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,890
We were just having fun

564
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,000
and I just... you overwhelmed me a little bit.

565
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,920
It's too soon.

566
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,880
It is a little too soon.

567
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,930
Yeah. I know.

568
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,270
I'll tell you what... why don't you go get ready for dinner?

569
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,760
We'll pretend the last hour never happened.

570
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,530
Are you sure?

571
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,550
I mean... can we really do that?

572
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,400
Yeah.

573
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,530
In fact in the movie business we do it all the time.

574
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,880
It's called a deleted scene.

575
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,670
Go pull yourself together Brooke Davis. You look a mess.

576
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,640
I'll wait for you.

577
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,550
Okay.

578
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,520
Can I have some ice cream now?

579
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,670
It's okay with me if it's okay with your... granny Deb.

580
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,530
One scoop.

581
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,240
Yes!

582
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,380
He's a good kid.

583
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,990
He's a great kid.

584
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:42,310
Who unfortunately drank the Dan scott kool-aid.

585
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,930
As soon as he's asleep

586
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,610
you're gone.

587
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:52,930
How about the comic stylings of the good Dr. Seuss?

588
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,850
How about a story about daddy when he was little?

589
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,010
You want a story about your dad?

590
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,270
Okay.

591
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,690
Let's see.

592
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,810
There was this one time we all went down to disney world.

593
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,090
That was when your dad was even younger than you are.

594
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,780
And we were at the petting zoo

595
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,700
and I wanted to take a picture of your dad petting this big brown goat,

596
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:14,510
when this bratty kid walks up and whacks the goat with a big stick.

597
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,130
That's when the goat hip-checks your dad 10 feet across the petting zoo.

598
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,710
He didn't even know what hit him.

599
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,370
Grandpa.

600
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,160
Why'd you and nanny Deb stop being married?

601
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:33,030
Well J-man... life's like a long race.

602
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,700
And some couples were meant to go the whole distance

603
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:38,740
and some were only meant to go halfway.

604
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,560
Do you still love each other?

605
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,630
Time for you to hit the hay.

606
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,290
What about mommy and daddy?

607
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,820
Will they ever stop being married?

608
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,620
If there's one thing I know

609
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,370
it's that your mom and dad are gonna
make it all the way to the finish line.

610
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,420
I love you buddy.
I love you grandpa.

611
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,140
Well the boy's out.

612
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,290
I guess the same goes for me.

613
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,270
I remember that trip to Disney World.

614
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,620
The only ride Nathan would go on was the tram to the parking garage.

615
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,270
So the two of you spent the whole day on it

616
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,390
talking basketball.

617
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,530
Yeah.

618
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,320
That was a great day.

619
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:53,000
We drove 600 miles to ride on a bus.

620
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:56,220
Still a great day.
Yeah.

621
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,040
We were supposed to be  this couple

622
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,530
tucking our grandkids in together.

623
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,560
Nobody sets out to have a failed marriage Deb.

624
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,060
It ends with a million little mistakes.

625
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,440
And a couple  really big ones.

626
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:32,730
Whenever I think the man I fell in love
with is still inside there somewhere...

627
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,670
I remember that you stood in that hallway

628
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:39,910
looked your brother in the eye

629
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:42,830
and pulled the trigger.

630
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,500
I've done my time Deb.

631
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,610
It'll never be enough.

632
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:51,590
Keith won't get any time back.

633
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,010
You want to talk about Keith?

634
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,850
Let's talk about Keith.

635
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,890
You're right.

636
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:05,390
In a single moment of hatred... I made the greatest mistake of my life.

637
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,240
But I did it because I thought I was getting revenge.

638
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,010
Okay.

639
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,370
It's time for you to go.

640
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,530
No. No. No. Not yet.

641
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,070
I thought I was getting revenge

642
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:20,790
'cause I thought Keith had poisoned that bottle
of scotch and left me there to burn to death.

643
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,720
But it wasn't Keith.

644
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,490
Was it Deb?

645
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,930
I... I... I don't want to hear this.

646
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,840
It was you wasn't it?!

647
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,660
You want to walk down
memory lane tonight?

648
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:36,330
I thought the reason Keith was trying to kill
me was 'cause I hired Jules to sleep with him.

649
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:39,230
And the reason I did that was 'cause
in one of the worst moments of my life

650
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:44,850
I walked in on my wife cheating on me with my own brother!

651
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:53,110
From the way I see it... I pulled the trigger... but you loaded the gun.

652
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:58,570
I've done my time Deb. Have you?

653
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,530
You don't think I've thought about
that every day for the past five years?

654
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,430
How I left Karen without Keith,

655
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:12,220
Lily without a father.

656
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,880
And that's why I hate you.

657
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,410
I hate you for killing Keith

658
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,250
and I hate you for the guilt I feel!

659
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,400
It's good that you're gonna die soon Dan.

660
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:26,590
It makes me believe in justice.

661
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:30,300
Now get the hell out.

662
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,860
Grandpa?

663
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:36,050
It's time for you to get better.

664
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,560
This house is starting to grow on me.

665
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,150
It's been a great anniversary.

666
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,160
But you did all this for me.

667
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,940
And I didn't give you anything.

668
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:07,450
That is not exactly true.

669
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,820
You've given me an amazing life so far.

670
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:16,810
Who knows? Maybe someday when my body's
completely wrecked and your singing days are over,

671
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:21,010
we can come back here and... grow old together.

672
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,840
What do you say?

673
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,530
Yes!I say yes!

674
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,130
Happy anniversary Haley James Scott.

675
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:33,470
George Bailey. I'll love you till the day I die.

676
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,520
Okay. I think I've gotten pretty presentable.

677
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,810
Yeah. Okay.

678
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,660
Right. Yeah. I'll be right there.

679
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:33,760
Who's that?

680
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,530
It was the production office. Apparently
one of the locations fell through.

681
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,360
I got to go down and figure it out.

682
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,500
Tonight?

683
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,370
Do you want me to go with you?

684
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,290
No. It'll probably take a while.

685
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,970
Okay.

686
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:50,780
Well... come over when you're done.

687
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,480
We can still have dessert.

688
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:58,080
I'll probably just crash at the hotel.

689
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,530
But I'll see you tomorrow.

690
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,570
You look beautiful Brooke.

691
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,870
Someday.

692
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,560
This scares me Peyton.

693
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,870
It'll be okay.

694
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,260
And what if it's not?

695
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:37,170
It will be.

696
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:41,330
We are gonna dance at this kid's wedding.

697
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,390
And we're gonna spoil our grandkids together.

698
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:48,070
I know it.

699
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,810
I'm doing this.

700
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,860
I'm having this baby.

701
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,600
No.

702
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:06,420
Wee having this baby.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
