1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,100
Previously on "one tree hill"...

2
00:00:07,434 --> 00:00:09,100
Do you know what's missing?

3
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:10,501
Cash from the register

4
00:00:10,534 --> 00:00:12,701
And the sketches for my new line.

5
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:15,434
I don't trust you or like you.

6
00:00:15,467 --> 00:00:18,000
So how about you stay out of my bed

7
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:20,601
And stay away from marvin?

8
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:22,667
You need to convince
lucas to do the movie.

9
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:24,901
And you'll make it the
movie he wants it to be.

10
00:00:24,934 --> 00:00:26,400
Absolutely.

11
00:00:26,434 --> 00:00:29,100
Hey, nate. I'm happy
to be a part of it, man.

12
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:30,267
What's that?

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,067
The comeback.

14
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,934
Don't call it a comeback, man.

15
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:51,400
A little old man and i fell out.

16
00:00:51,434 --> 00:00:54,234
I'll tell you what it was all about.

17
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:58,133
He had money, and i had none,

18
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:02,634
And that's the way the noise begun.

19
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:09,033
74.

20
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:10,300
Sure?

21
00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:12,033
Yep. 74 inches, daddy.

22
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:13,667
6'2".

23
00:01:13,701 --> 00:01:14,868
I can measure again.

24
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:16,133
No.

25
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:17,534
It's okay.

26
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:19,400
I've been 6'2" since i was 17.

27
00:01:19,434 --> 00:01:20,634
Is that bad?

28
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:23,634
Well, if i was 6'5", i
might be in the pros by now.

29
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,534
What if you were 8'5"?

30
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:28,200
I'd probably be dead of heart failure.

31
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:30,801
Well, i think 6'2" is perfect.

32
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:33,367
Heck, i'd settle for 4'2".

33
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,200
Well, you can thank your
short-Pants mom for that. Hey!

34
00:01:36,234 --> 00:01:37,834
He got some good stuff from me,

35
00:01:37,868 --> 00:01:40,734
Like the piano he's gonna rock
at the talent show tonight, huh?

36
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,300
Huh? Yeah.

37
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:44,167
Are you gonna be there, daddy?

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,467
I wouldn't miss it.

39
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:47,200
I wish i could come with you today.

40
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:48,467
I know.

41
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:51,934
I tell you what ...  i'll
tell you all about it, okay?

42
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:53,868
And this idea you have?

43
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:55,901
It's what you want to do?

44
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:57,868
It's what i have to do.

45
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:03,934
Sam! Breakfast!

46
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:18,934
Hi.

47
00:02:18,968 --> 00:02:22,968
He spent the night in your bed?

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,701
In my house?!

49
00:02:24,734 --> 00:02:27,467
Well, i thought it was
out time a guy stayed here.

50
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:29,801
Watch yourself.

51
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:32,334
Look, he's my friend, and
he lives with s brother.

52
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:34,400
And he just ...  he
beats on him sometimes,

53
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:36,033
And he needed a place to crash.

54
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:39,601
Okay.

55
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:41,901
Does this half-Nude,
window-Fleeing friend

56
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:43,067
Have a name?

57
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:46,667
Jack daniels.

58
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,701
John "jack" daniels.

59
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:52,567
You expect me to believe that a boy

60
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:55,234
Named after the
white-Trash-Rock-Band drink of choice

61
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:58,868
Spent the night in your
bed and nothing happened?

62
00:02:58,901 --> 00:03:00,601
Dude, i'm like 15.

63
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:03,434
Like that matters! When i was 15 ...

64
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:07,634
Never mind.

65
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,834
Tell me when someone
is staying in my house,

66
00:03:11,868 --> 00:03:14,934
And if your friend needs
a place to "crash" again,

67
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:17,501
He can sleep on the couch!

68
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:19,434
Now just...

69
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:21,367
Go do something.

70
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:29,767
Hi, luke.

71
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:32,667
I'll stay on the movie...
because it matters to me.

72
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:34,501
But you and i are not friends,

73
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:37,467
And you d peyton aren't anything.

74
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:40,968
How is our girl peyton?

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,100
And how long have you been
experiencing this pain?

76
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:45,400
A few days.

77
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:48,033
Any history of diabetes
in the family? Ulcers?

78
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:50,467
Um...no.

79
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:51,868
Cancer?

80
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:55,000
My birth mother died of cancer. Why?

81
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:57,434
What ...  what's the
face that you're making?

82
00:03:57,467 --> 00:04:00,000
We just want to run some tests.

83
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:01,868
Consider it a test.

84
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:04,267
You fly to los angeles,
and while you're gone,

85
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,634
If peyton doesn't fall
in love with me again,

86
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:10,000
Then you'll know you
two were meant to be.

87
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:12,234
You're a dick. You know that?

88
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:16,701
Listen, the truth is, this
guy's an a-List director.

89
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:19,701
He's got several offers, and
you need to meet with him.

90
00:04:19,734 --> 00:04:20,968
Today? Why?

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,701
Because i told you we'd be
equal partners on this movie,

92
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:25,834
And i need you to sign off on him.

93
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:27,400
What are you gonna do?

94
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,534
I'm producing a movie, luke.

95
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,067
Contrary to popular belief,

96
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,534
I'm not staying in town
to hit on your fiancée.

97
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,767
It's your book.

98
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:49,801
What?

99
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:52,300
You just froze there,
halfway out the window.

100
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,000
You looked like such a dork.

101
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:55,767
Well, you're the one who
didn't set the alarm right.

102
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:58,734
Whatever. She thought we were doing it.

103
00:04:58,767 --> 00:04:59,834
As if.

104
00:04:59,868 --> 00:05:01,601
What do you mean, "as if"?

105
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,834
A lot of girls would do it with me.

106
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:05,267
Yeah.

107
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,868
But those girls are called prostitutes.

108
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:10,334
Why?

109
00:05:12,968 --> 00:05:14,901
Hi.

110
00:05:14,934 --> 00:05:16,534
Producer guy, right?

111
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,968
Orphan girl, right? From the concert?

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,734
Sam. Julian.

113
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,634
I know.

114
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,033
You can help me.

115
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:26,534
Good. You can help me, too.

116
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:32,801
So, what happens at
this... what do you call it?

117
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:34,234
It's called a combine.

118
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,701
Coaches and scouts from the
pro teams come watch you play.

119
00:05:36,734 --> 00:05:38,634
And they pick you for the nba?

120
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:43,567
You find them yet? No.

121
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:46,801
Hey, i think you should
wear the number 12 next.

122
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:47,901
Why?

123
00:05:47,934 --> 00:05:49,501
I don't know. I like the number 12.

124
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:51,767
That's what i'm gonna
wear when i'm in the pros.

125
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:54,400
All right. Okay, i found them.

126
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:56,667
Oh, good.

127
00:05:56,701 --> 00:05:59,300
These are really ugly, dad.

128
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:00,534
Well, they made a few models,

129
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:02,133
So just pick one you
like, you knucklehead.

130
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:04,968
Okay.

131
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,467
So, your mom's pretty excited

132
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:08,901
About you playing the piano
at your talent show tonight.

133
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:09,901
I know.

134
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:11,567
You don't sound very pumped up.

135
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:13,734
I just kind of wanted to tell jokes.

136
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:15,501
Dude, i've heard your jokes.

137
00:06:15,534 --> 00:06:17,234
Trust me, stick with the piano.

138
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:21,267
But the song is a kiddy song,
and i'm not very good at it.

139
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,701
Well, all you can do is
the best you can, all right?

140
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:26,734
That's all that matters.

141
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,367
Speaking of which,

142
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,100
Are you telling me you can't
find those shoes by now?

143
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh, i found the shoes a long time ago.

144
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:34,133
I just like it up here.

145
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:40,267
We found the shoes.

146
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,634
Yay!

147
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,601
All set?

148
00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:45,267
Yeah.

149
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,634
All right.

150
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:49,968
See you at the talent show.

151
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,467
Go be great.

152
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:55,300
Love you.

153
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:56,601
Love you.

154
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:01,567
Daddy.

155
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:03,667
All you can do is your best, okay?

156
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,501
You want some coffee with that sugar?

157
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:18,167
How do you take yours?

158
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:20,568
I don't. Never touch the stuff.

159
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,600
So, you said i could
help you out. How so?

160
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:25,834
I was thinking, um,

161
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:27,800
Maybe you could read
some of the stuff i wrote.

162
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:29,334
You're a screenwriter?

163
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:30,568
I just write things.

164
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,667
I get a little pissed
off sometimes, you know?

165
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:37,101
Okay. Tell me about brooke davis.

166
00:07:37,134 --> 00:07:39,667
Dude, i am so not hooking you two up.

167
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,334
No, no, her clothing
line. Is she any good?

168
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:44,934
Yeah. Think you'd be lucky to have her.

169
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:47,967
For the movie, right?
That's why you're asking?

170
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,201
Give me your phone.

171
00:07:50,234 --> 00:07:52,767
This is my number.

172
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,234
I'm happy to read anything
you want to send me.

173
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,334
You'd do that?

174
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:58,434
I mean, i just kind
of heard you're a dick.

175
00:07:58,468 --> 00:08:00,000
I am.

176
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:02,468
But maybe i'll read
something i can steal.

177
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:04,101
I got this.

178
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:09,034
Hey, is she single ...  brooke?

179
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:10,468
No.

180
00:08:12,134 --> 00:08:13,834
Yeah.

181
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:18,633
You know, i'm betting
you're actually nice.

182
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:21,000
And i'm betting you're not bitter.

183
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,334
Keep writing, sam.

184
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:26,434
She's out of your league, my brother.

185
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:43,401
I told gigi to stay away from marvin,

186
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:44,501
And the next thing i know,

187
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:47,167
She's hugging him in the parking lot.

188
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:49,367
What were you doing in the parking lot?

189
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:51,201
Spying.

190
00:08:51,234 --> 00:08:53,468
Well, what am i supposed to do?

191
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:55,167
She's a horny college party girl.

192
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,167
Millie, he's amused by her.

193
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:01,401
So, i don't want a guy who's
amused by someone like that.

194
00:09:01,434 --> 00:09:03,234
Okay.

195
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:09,201
I know those girls...
because i've been those girls.

196
00:09:09,234 --> 00:09:13,334
And all guys are amused by it.

197
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:15,301
It doesn't mean anything.

198
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:18,034
Mouth is not gonna fall for that.

199
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:21,201
He's not.

200
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:26,867
Trust me, she's harmless.

201
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,633
You ever think about
having sex on the news desk?

202
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:30,733
No.

203
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:32,800
Maybe.

204
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:34,234
What are you doing?

205
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:36,267
Well, the news team is
on location, so chris said

206
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:38,301
I could have my going-Away
party in here tonight.

207
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:39,534
6:30 okay?

208
00:09:39,568 --> 00:09:41,667
Actually, i have to go
to jamie's talent show.

209
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,733
I'm totally not having my
going-Away party without you.

210
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:46,800
Please.

211
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:50,568
One drink. I wouldn't miss it.

212
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:53,534
You're gonna have to miss it.

213
00:09:53,568 --> 00:09:54,767
Peyton, come on!

214
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,468
You have to get back into the studio.

215
00:09:57,501 --> 00:09:59,900
Mia, i'm being very serious, okay?

216
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:02,800
I'm so proud of you, and
the first record did great.

217
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:05,967
But our label friend, john,
who i do not have a thing for,

218
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,568
Is getting very impatient
for the next one,

219
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,733
So just tell me that you
have been working on the demos

220
00:10:11,767 --> 00:10:13,000
I asked you to do.

221
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:15,301
Peyton, i've had a lot going on.

222
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:16,800
Okay, fine.

223
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:18,967
How many songs do you have?

224
00:10:23,134 --> 00:10:25,934
I have a couple ideas.

225
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:29,700
All right.

226
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:33,434
The label would like for
you to listen to this.

227
00:10:33,468 --> 00:10:34,934
What for?

228
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,867
Because there are some very talented,

229
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,733
Very expensive songwriters on there,

230
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:40,934
And they want you to
pick a track to record.

231
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:43,101
But i write my own songs.

232
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:44,267
Apparently not.

233
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:46,534
Apparently, you just
write a couple ideas.

234
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:52,000
Hello? Hi.

235
00:10:52,034 --> 00:10:54,468
Oh, luke. Hi, honey. I'm sorry.

236
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:57,834
No, no, no, i was just
expecting another call.

237
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:00,767
Yeah. No, i had to leave
really early this morning.

238
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,501
Um, i had a ...  like
a meeting with a band.

239
00:11:05,134 --> 00:11:08,134
Can you hold on one second? Okay.

240
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,234
Please, just listen to that.

241
00:11:11,267 --> 00:11:15,534
Hi, okay. Sorry.

242
00:11:15,568 --> 00:11:18,767
L.A.? Why are you going to l.A.?

243
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:30,000
Name and affiliation?

244
00:11:30,034 --> 00:11:32,334
Nathan scott, university of maryland.

245
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:33,834
Professional affiliation.

246
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:37,201
Who invited you to the combine?

247
00:11:37,234 --> 00:11:39,067
No one did, sir.

248
00:11:39,101 --> 00:11:42,234
These are professional trials,
son ...  invitation only.

249
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:43,568
I understand that.

250
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,501
Look, i was an all-American
at maryland last season,

251
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:50,000
And i was just hoping that...

252
00:11:55,101 --> 00:11:56,934
Look, this is kind of my last shot.

253
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,800
Didn't you get thrown through a window?

254
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:05,234
Please.

255
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:07,700
I'm sorry. You can't be here.

256
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,334
Nathan.

257
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,334
He's with us.

258
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:27,800
Better go suit up.

259
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:08,600
"Breakfast club." You were the priss.

260
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:11,333
Let me guess. You were the stoner?

261
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:13,801
Well, if you say so.
They end up together.

262
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,400
Can i help you?

263
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:19,067
You should design the
wardrobe for the movie.

264
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:21,667
I'm not a costume designer.

265
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,667
Oh. I can see that.

266
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,934
I'm starting a new line.

267
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:28,101
Well, okay, let me try this again.

268
00:13:28,134 --> 00:13:30,300
You should design the
wardrobe for the movie.

269
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,767
You were there, it's authentic,

270
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:34,001
It's press-Worthy, and i
would be lucky to have you

271
00:13:34,034 --> 00:13:35,600
Before the debut of your new line,

272
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:37,400
Which i'm sure is going to be fabulous.

273
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:42,433
Sorry.

274
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:44,234
Hello?

275
00:13:44,268 --> 00:13:46,168
Yes, this is me.

276
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,901
It is too me.

277
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:50,234
Oh, listen, i'm with brooke right now.

278
00:13:50,268 --> 00:13:52,367
No, i'm not gonna blow it.

279
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,767
No, i am not.

280
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:55,367
No, i'm not.

281
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,034
Sorry. Sam says hi.

282
00:13:58,067 --> 00:13:59,567
Sam? My sam?

283
00:14:00,934 --> 00:14:03,300
And why does my sam
have your phone number?

284
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,367
She has an interest
in the film industry.

285
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,201
She is 15, you pervert.

286
00:14:08,234 --> 00:14:11,333
Okay, just wrap your
head around it, okay?

287
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:12,901
You and the movie, i mean.

288
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:15,367
Not me and sam. She's only 15, you know.

289
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,134
You pervert.

290
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,600
Hey, man, whose shoes are those?

291
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:32,268
Mine.

292
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,168
I know that, but i'm saying,
who else shoes are they?

293
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:36,534
Ray allen? Kg?

294
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:38,567
I heard what you asked.

295
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,101
I meant what i said. They're mine.

296
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:43,333
Whatever you say, baller.

297
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:45,001
Kid got his own shoe contract,

298
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:47,600
But he's still trying
out for the big league.

299
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:49,101
Don't matter none, anyhow.

300
00:14:49,134 --> 00:14:51,400
Ain't nobody gonna give no roster spot

301
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,667
To no fool with no green elf shoes on.

302
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,168
Hey, man, let me see
those things, riddler.

303
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:15,934
37 inches.

304
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,834
Get a close enough look?

305
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:24,967
10, 11, 12, 13,

306
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:30,767
14, 15, 16, 17...

307
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,134
3.1.

308
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,300
Shame how you've let yourself go, nate.

309
00:15:53,433 --> 00:15:55,600
You were kind of skanky, weren't you?

310
00:15:55,634 --> 00:15:57,467
What? In high school.

311
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,534
You acted all weird this morning

312
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:02,101
Because you were
totally having sex at 15.

313
00:16:02,134 --> 00:16:03,634
I was not.

314
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,433
You were, too.

315
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:07,034
Is that where "clothes
over bros" came from?

316
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:09,268
Tired of being the dirty girl?

317
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,101
'Cause you're a bit of a prude now.

318
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:13,400
First of all, shut it.

319
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:16,700
Second of all, if i have
been a little frigid lately...

320
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:22,433
...it's probably because i...

321
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:25,433
Was attacked at my store...

322
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:28,034
Not long before you moved in,

323
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:31,001
And it's made me a little closed off ...

324
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:32,801
Especially with boys.

325
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:34,834
Oh, my god. Brooke, did he ...

326
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:35,967
No.

327
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:37,801
No.

328
00:16:37,834 --> 00:16:41,600
But i've been really angry about it,

329
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:46,534
And i have a whole nother
set of issues with owen.

330
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:49,001
And i'm...

331
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:50,234
Trying to let it all go,

332
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:51,934
And i just wanted you to know.

333
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:58,600
Because... i just want you to know.

334
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:00,134
Okay?

335
00:17:00,168 --> 00:17:02,667
Okay.

336
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:07,567
And, yeah...

337
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,534
For the record, i was
pretty slutty in high school.

338
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:12,534
And i wish i wouldn't have been,

339
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:16,500
'Cause you don't get to
take any of that back.

340
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:17,934
Brooke.

341
00:17:21,634 --> 00:17:25,168
I like talking to you.

342
00:17:26,534 --> 00:17:29,034
Thanks, sam. I like talking to you, too.

343
00:17:43,734 --> 00:17:45,168
Excuse me!

344
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,201
Excuse me!

345
00:17:53,268 --> 00:17:54,901
Hi.

346
00:17:54,934 --> 00:17:56,300
Uh, i'm ...

347
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,901
Lucas scott!

348
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:01,834
"And in that moment, he realized

349
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:05,967
"It's not what you are or who you are,

350
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:09,967
But who they allow you to be."

351
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:13,067
That is good writing.

352
00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:15,767
Really good writing!

353
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,467
I love this script.

354
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,001
Love it!

355
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:33,167
I don't want to come out.

356
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,067
Come on, buddy. I want to see you.

357
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,267
No, i look like a tool.

358
00:18:37,301 --> 00:18:39,267
James lucas scott.

359
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:43,434
You look so awesome!

360
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:45,134
I look like a penguin.

361
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,534
You look cute!

362
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:49,601
Now come over here, and we
will go over this song again.

363
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:53,467
Little tie!

364
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:54,833
Looks so cute.

365
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:01,467
Sorry, i always mess that up.

366
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:03,601
It's okay.

367
00:19:03,634 --> 00:19:04,701
You nervous?

368
00:19:04,734 --> 00:19:05,900
A little.

369
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:07,833
Yeah, you definitely get that from me.

370
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:10,634
I wonder how daddy's doing.

371
00:19:10,668 --> 00:19:14,234
I remember now. You
played at maryland, right?

372
00:19:14,267 --> 00:19:17,534
Got into a scrape
right before the draft.

373
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:19,167
Man, you that fool.

374
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,967
6'5 1/4".

375
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,434
You hear that?

376
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:23,734
Point guard!

377
00:19:23,768 --> 00:19:25,701
6'5 1/4".

378
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:28,000
Thank you, god and my mama.

379
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:34,534
Nathan scott, ladies and gentlemen.

380
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:36,867
6'2."

381
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,933
Ooh, 6'2" shooting guard.

382
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:42,567
Are there any scouts out
here for the ymca rec league?

383
00:19:42,601 --> 00:19:44,067
All right, all right.

384
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,167
Gentlemen, we're gonna
divide you up into groups

385
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,734
And let you play.

386
00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:52,100
Point guards on my right.
Two-Guards on my left.

387
00:19:52,134 --> 00:19:54,367
Forwards and centers,
other end of the court.

388
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,867
Show us what you got.

389
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,301
Let's go, fellas.

390
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:06,967
Nathan.

391
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:09,967
Two-Guards over here.

392
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,900
I'm trying out as a point guard.

393
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:15,567
Okay.

394
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:18,601
But... you ever played the point?

395
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:22,467
Well, i've never played
point guard in my life.

396
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:23,668
You better learn,

397
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:26,067
'Cause you're too short to
play the two in the pros.

398
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,100
Bro, you 6'2".

399
00:20:29,134 --> 00:20:30,567
And i was also 12 hours away

400
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:32,601
From being an nba
lottery pick, you idiot.

401
00:20:32,634 --> 00:20:33,967
Well, i'm glad you had the accident,

402
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,401
'Cause you sure wouldn't have made it.

403
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:36,534
You got to move to the point.

404
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:37,768
You're out of your mind!

405
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,900
You realize nobody's
ever told me this before?

406
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:41,867
Well, i'm telling you now, all right?

407
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,200
And anyways, man,

408
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:45,067
They all get their
commission when you sign.

409
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,800
Ain't like nobody gonna risk their 10%

410
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:47,900
By telling you the truth.

411
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:49,634
Huh?

412
00:20:49,668 --> 00:20:52,000
Now, look, nate.

413
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:53,768
Yo, if you can make it

414
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,768
By playing against tall guys
at the two, man, all good.

415
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,234
But if you can't, we
work on your handle,

416
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:03,067
We work on your quickness,
and we make damn sure

417
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,601
You got the best shot
of playing pro ball.

418
00:21:05,634 --> 00:21:08,967
Why are you doing this for me, q?

419
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:15,034
This ain't just your dream, man.

420
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,334
Let's work on that left.

421
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:21,134
Numbers are funny.

422
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:24,933
They can measure you, time
you, analyze you all they want,

423
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:26,768
But they all know what really matters

424
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,867
Is how you play the game.

425
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,301
He thinki've lost a step
because of my accident,

426
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:32,634
So he's gonna play me tight.

427
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:34,668
I haven't.

428
00:21:37,301 --> 00:21:38,634
Whoo!

429
00:21:47,301 --> 00:21:48,668
Now he'll back off

430
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:50,867
Because he doesn't want to
get beat off the dribble.

431
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,401
Just a half step.

432
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:57,334
That's a mistake.

433
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:01,668
Whoo!

434
00:22:01,701 --> 00:22:04,434
You ever heard the expression
"they can't measure heart"?

435
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:06,900
Well, the truth is, they
can't measure any of it ...

436
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:10,401
Heart, want, need.

437
00:22:10,434 --> 00:22:14,034
They think i can't play point guard.

438
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,933
But q knew i could.

439
00:22:20,134 --> 00:22:22,200
You can't measure a dream.

440
00:22:25,267 --> 00:22:27,601
Mouth, you made it.

441
00:22:27,634 --> 00:22:29,200
Here, you better catch up.

442
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:31,000
You're like the devil. You know that?

443
00:22:31,034 --> 00:22:33,534
No, just devilish.

444
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:35,867
What's that?

445
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,768
Just a little going-Away present.

446
00:22:46,534 --> 00:22:48,668
Oh, it's the t-Shirt i slept in

447
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,467
After i thew up and
passed out in your bed.

448
00:22:51,501 --> 00:22:52,833
Oh, it's so sweet.

449
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:58,100
You never told me how you got
me into this t-Shirt, mouth.

450
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:01,800
Maybe sometime you can get me out of it.

451
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:12,734
Is this your first script?

452
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:15,067
Yeah.

453
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,467
Don't worry. I'll fix i

454
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:20,367
Uh, is there something wrong with it?

455
00:23:20,401 --> 00:23:21,933
No.

456
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:22,933
I love it.

457
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:24,601
I said i love it, and i love it.

458
00:23:24,634 --> 00:23:27,467
A couple thoughts, that's all.

459
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:29,334
Okay, like what?

460
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:32,967
All right, clear your head, all right?

461
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,768
What if haley...

462
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,234
Dies?

463
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,334
You're serious?

464
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:44,967
I'm saying think about it.

465
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,267
People love that stuff. Man,
dicaprio died in "titanic."

466
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:52,467
That is gold, baby, gold!

467
00:23:52,501 --> 00:23:54,100
Yes, but it didn't happen.

468
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:55,301
It doesn't matter.

469
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:57,967
Let me ask you this. Who
goes to see this movie?

470
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,267
The same little bitches
who went and saw "titanic."

471
00:24:00,301 --> 00:24:01,933
Young girls, man.

472
00:24:01,967 --> 00:24:03,867
They don't have a voice,

473
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,301
But when they find something
that speaks to them,

474
00:24:07,334 --> 00:24:09,267
We're talking box office, baby!

475
00:24:09,301 --> 00:24:10,768
You're king of the world!

476
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,167
Whew!

477
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,134
Even so,

478
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:18,100
Haley can't just..Ie.

479
00:24:21,367 --> 00:24:22,833
You got a vision.

480
00:24:24,634 --> 00:24:26,668
I can respect that.

481
00:24:34,034 --> 00:24:36,134
What about this?

482
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:40,000
What if lucas and haley get married?

483
00:24:40,034 --> 00:24:42,167
I'm serious about this one,

484
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,367
'Cause if there's one thing that i know,

485
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:47,334
It's that audiences get crazy
over who ends up together.

486
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:57,167
It's what i do, luke.

487
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,867
It's what i know.

488
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:03,067
Think about it.

489
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,833
I thought about it.

490
00:25:04,867 --> 00:25:06,234
And i'm not interested.

491
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:08,833
You couldn't have told
me that over the phone?

492
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:10,134
Well, that, yeah,

493
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:12,668
But the rest of this i
wanted to say to your face.

494
00:25:12,701 --> 00:25:14,567
I don't trust you...

495
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:17,567
Not with peyton, and
definitely not with sam.

496
00:25:19,668 --> 00:25:23,167
And that is not gonna get
you anywhere ...  the grin.

497
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,367
I'm sure it's gotten
you in a lot of doors

498
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,567
And in a lot of beds,

499
00:25:27,601 --> 00:25:29,867
But it's not gonna do
you any good with me.

500
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,067
Listen, brooke, when i make a movie,

501
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,434
I set the bar as high as i possibly can.

502
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:36,501
I put together my wish-List cast,

503
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,933
My wish-List crew,
my wish-List designer,

504
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:42,301
And sometimes, you know,
the timing works out,

505
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:45,467
The material works
out, and you get lucky.

506
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:51,334
Sometimes you don't.

507
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:53,967
Good luck with everything.

508
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:22,601
I didn't listen to it.

509
00:26:24,534 --> 00:26:25,833
I write my own songs.

510
00:26:25,867 --> 00:26:28,434
Mia, i am not in the
best mood right now,

511
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:30,367
And so it is a very bad time

512
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:32,900
For you to make some naive little stand.

513
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:34,401
You think i'm naive?

514
00:26:34,434 --> 00:26:36,334
Peyton, i am not the same girl

515
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:38,434
Who left on tour last year, okay?

516
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:41,634
God, i hope that's not true,
because i liked that girl.

517
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:43,768
As a matter of fact, i loved that girl.

518
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,334
Oh, really? Then what
happened to protecting her?

519
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:48,734
What happened to telling
the label to be patient,

520
00:26:48,768 --> 00:26:50,567
Because my songs are gonna be great?

521
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:52,167
Oh, i've been doing that!

522
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,567
I have been doing that for months now!

523
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:57,668
But what happened to
actually doing the work, mia?

524
00:26:57,701 --> 00:27:00,501
Now, the label wants
you to record this song

525
00:27:00,534 --> 00:27:01,833
Because they care.

526
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:05,034
When they stop caring,
that's when we have a problem.

527
00:27:05,067 --> 00:27:07,200
Well, i'm not gonna do it.

528
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:09,701
You are being so ungrateful!
Do you understand?

529
00:27:09,734 --> 00:27:13,367
I put my ass on the line
for you every single day!

530
00:27:13,401 --> 00:27:15,701
Well, i put my ass on the line for you

531
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,501
Every single night, peyton.

532
00:27:17,534 --> 00:27:18,634
Okay? Literally.

533
00:27:18,668 --> 00:27:20,701
Did you see how short that skirt was

534
00:27:20,734 --> 00:27:22,867
That you put me in at the u.S.O. Show?

535
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,933
But i did it.

536
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:26,734
I've done everything
you've asked me to do,

537
00:27:26,768 --> 00:27:28,501
But i am not gonna do this.

538
00:27:28,534 --> 00:27:29,734
Hey.

539
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:38,668
I'm not sure you should
be on this label anymore.

540
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:43,100
Life's too short.

541
00:27:43,134 --> 00:27:45,301
Trust me.

542
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,800
Man, madison's really killing it.

543
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:29,501
I knew i should've told jokes.

544
00:28:29,534 --> 00:28:32,734
Seriously. You're hosed.

545
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:40,734
Hi. Hey!

546
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,334
You smell like alcohol.

547
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:45,401
Really? Yeah.

548
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:47,401
Is it bad? No.

549
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,534
Do you have any with you?

550
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:50,601
No.

551
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,467
Hey! Look who we found!

552
00:29:00,501 --> 00:29:01,567
Hey!

553
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:04,367
Hi, mouth. Hey, baby.

554
00:29:04,401 --> 00:29:05,668
How did it go?

555
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:10,067
I did what my son told me
to ...  the best i could.

556
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:21,501
Here he comes!

557
00:29:21,534 --> 00:29:23,100
He looks so cute!

558
00:29:23,134 --> 00:29:24,367
He's nervous.

559
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,967
Hi, my name is james lucas scott,

560
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,800
And i'm gonna play "the first noel."

561
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,434
He's just got to get
past this first part,

562
00:29:35,467 --> 00:29:36,900
And he'll be good.

563
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:55,900
Oh, no.

564
00:29:57,601 --> 00:29:59,401
This is awkward.

565
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
How's everyone doing tonight?

566
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:25,434
Last week, my mom asked me
how i liked going to school.

567
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:30,067
I told her, "not as much as
i like coming home from it."

568
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:41,434
And seriously, what's
with the cafeteria food?

569
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:46,134
I mean, i can't tell if kids are
out sick from eating that stuff,

570
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:49,167
Or we're actually eating
the kids who are out sick.

571
00:30:51,234 --> 00:30:54,933
Take my hot lunch...please.

572
00:30:57,501 --> 00:31:01,833
And now, the big finish.

573
00:31:11,734 --> 00:31:13,067
Something like that.

574
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,267
What do you want from me? I'm 5.

575
00:31:15,301 --> 00:31:17,668
Thank you and good night!

576
00:31:38,701 --> 00:31:42,000
Should've gone to jamie's
talent show with brooke.

577
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:43,434
You're kidding, right?

578
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:44,534
I like them.

579
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:46,100
They're nice to me.

580
00:31:46,134 --> 00:31:48,401
I think it's funny how
you stole from brooke davis

581
00:31:48,434 --> 00:31:49,734
And called her a bitch,

582
00:31:49,768 --> 00:31:51,200
And now you like her.

583
00:31:51,234 --> 00:31:53,234
I was pissed off. So what?

584
00:31:53,267 --> 00:31:56,067
What'd you say after she
caught you shoplifting?

585
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,933
You said she was a rich bitch

586
00:31:57,967 --> 00:31:59,701
And someone should put her in her place.

587
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:01,167
So?

588
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,933
You said someone should
put her in her place, sam.

589
00:32:10,034 --> 00:32:14,967
So, tell me again why lucas
has to end up with peyton.

590
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,933
Because they do.

591
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:20,401
Because that's the story.
Because that's what happened.

592
00:32:20,434 --> 00:32:22,134
It's a movie!

593
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:24,534
Got to raise the stakes.

594
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:28,534
Kill off one of the younger characters.

595
00:32:30,601 --> 00:32:32,501
Hello?

596
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,768
Hi, doctor. It's me.

597
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,067
Well, what does that mean?

598
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,034
What's wrong?

599
00:32:43,867 --> 00:32:46,768
After you caught me shoplifting,

600
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:49,501
I was with my friends,

601
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:52,234
And i said some terrible
things about you.

602
00:32:52,267 --> 00:32:54,501
Okay.

603
00:32:54,534 --> 00:32:56,267
Sam, what happened?

604
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,668
Well ...  don't, please. Just don't.

605
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:03,900
But i didn't mean them.

606
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:06,167
I didn't ...  i didn't mean any of it.

607
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:10,567
But...

608
00:33:10,601 --> 00:33:12,967
Sam, i'm sorry. I don't understand.

609
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:37,967
The attack...

610
00:33:40,534 --> 00:33:42,367
...it was my fault.

611
00:34:00,134 --> 00:34:03,300
Bourbon is a good,
honest drink, you know?

612
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:04,768
Classier than whiskey.

613
00:34:04,801 --> 00:34:07,401
Less of a stick up its ass than scotch.

614
00:34:10,601 --> 00:34:13,434
I'm an alcoholic.

615
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:15,300
Owen...

616
00:34:15,334 --> 00:34:16,967
Has sam been in here tonight?

617
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,300
No. Why? What's wrong?

618
00:34:18,334 --> 00:34:19,868
We had a ...  a thing

619
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,734
And she left and i let her
go and i shouldn't have.

620
00:34:23,768 --> 00:34:25,768
It's okay. Here, have a seat.

621
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:27,167
No, i have to find her.

622
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,300
Brooke, come on, she's a teenager.

623
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:31,467
She's not even your teenager.

624
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:34,167
And what is that supposed to mean?

625
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,967
I'll let you two...

626
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,667
Julian, if she calls you ...

627
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,868
It's not my problem.

628
00:34:43,967 --> 00:34:47,267
Look...i just mean

629
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,967
It's not like she's gonna
stay with you forever, right?

630
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,868
What is wrong with you?

631
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,868
I came here because i need your help.

632
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,868
But, i mean, you know
sam. She'll turn up.

633
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,300
No

634
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:02,033
It's different this time.

635
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:05,167
But with you, it's exactly the same.

636
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,401
Hey, brooke!

637
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:11,534
That's not fair.

638
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,900
I have to find her!

639
00:35:14,933 --> 00:35:18,601
But i'll do it by myself,
just like i always do.

640
00:35:18,634 --> 00:35:20,300
Don't call me anymore.

641
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:31,334
So, how about we rent a
movie, and then we can ...

642
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:38,567
I was looking for the
number for the pizza place.

643
00:35:38,601 --> 00:35:40,567
Oh, no. No, no, millie, it's not ...

644
00:35:40,601 --> 00:35:42,234
It's not what it looks like?

645
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:44,434
This isn't a half-Naked
picture of your ex-Girlfriend

646
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:45,967
In one of your t-Shirts?

647
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,567
She sent it to me
tonight. It was a joke.

648
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:49,801
Millie, please.

649
00:35:49,834 --> 00:35:51,900
There is nothing going
on between us, i swear.

650
00:35:51,933 --> 00:35:53,167
I-I was gonna delete it.

651
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,300
But you didn't.

652
00:35:56,868 --> 00:35:59,300
You know what?

653
00:35:59,334 --> 00:36:02,033
You're an idiot.

654
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:05,234
Millie, don't go, please.

655
00:36:05,267 --> 00:36:06,801
It doesn't mean anything.

656
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:09,933
You're wrong, marvin.

657
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:11,768
It means everything.

658
00:36:19,234 --> 00:36:23,000
How funny was your son tonight?

659
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:26,967
Oh, he was goofy, like his mom.

660
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,701
I think he was brave, like his dad.

661
00:36:31,768 --> 00:36:34,100
Mmm.

662
00:36:34,134 --> 00:36:37,601
So, what's next with our comeback?

663
00:36:37,634 --> 00:36:40,667
Well, what's next is
the phone's gonna ring,

664
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:43,900
And the answer is either
gonna be a yes or a no.

665
00:36:43,933 --> 00:36:46,933
It's going to be a yes.

666
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:48,801
I hope so.

667
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:52,534
But if it's a no, then
this is the end of it,

668
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:54,401
And i'm okay with that.

669
00:37:28,534 --> 00:37:32,033
Rough night, millie?

670
00:37:32,067 --> 00:37:34,768
Horrible.

671
00:37:37,734 --> 00:37:38,933
Yeah, me, too.

672
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,534
You know i haven't had a
drink in over eight years?

673
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:58,701
Tonight, that's gonna change.

674
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,868
I haven't had sex in over 22 years.

675
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:08,801
And tonight, that's gonna change.

676
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,900
Thank you.

677
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:15,033
Hey.

678
00:38:15,067 --> 00:38:16,334
Hey, any luck?

679
00:38:16,367 --> 00:38:19,033
Uh, no. Are you looking for her, too?

680
00:38:19,067 --> 00:38:20,834
I'm not that guy, brooke.

681
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:23,234
I'm just getting coffee. Sorry.

682
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:26,667
Excuse me.

683
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:27,768
I'm looking for someone ...

684
00:38:27,801 --> 00:38:29,401
A young girl that comes in here a lot.

685
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:32,900
She's kind of a skater, sarcastic.

686
00:38:32,933 --> 00:38:34,734
Let me guess.

687
00:38:34,768 --> 00:38:35,834
Her name is sam,

688
00:38:35,868 --> 00:38:38,200
And she puts a lot of
sugar in her coffee.

689
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:39,334
You've seen her?

690
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:41,801
No, but that cute guy that just left

691
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:43,933
Asked me the same exact thing.

692
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:46,701
Thanks.

693
00:39:00,567 --> 00:39:01,933
And then he got worried,

694
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:04,000
And he backed off just a half step.

695
00:39:04,033 --> 00:39:05,801
So, what do you think i did?

696
00:39:05,834 --> 00:39:07,933
Pulled up for 3 ...  nothing but net.

697
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:09,534
That's right.

698
00:39:09,567 --> 00:39:11,267
You know, i'm proud of you, buddy.

699
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,734
You took something that
would've beaten most people,

700
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,033
And you kept going with it.

701
00:39:15,067 --> 00:39:17,134
You turned it into something great.

702
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:19,367
So did you, daddy.

703
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:24,234
All right, chris rock, i
know you're still wired,

704
00:39:24,267 --> 00:39:25,834
But it's time for bed.

705
00:39:25,868 --> 00:39:27,868
How about a nursery rhyme?

706
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,100
Okay.

707
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:31,534
But you're gonna have to read it.

708
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:33,000
You want an old-School, creepy one,

709
00:39:33,033 --> 00:39:34,234
Or a new,
good-For-You one?

710
00:39:34,267 --> 00:39:36,067
Old-School creepy. Okay.

711
00:39:38,534 --> 00:39:40,100
Okay.

712
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,300
There.

713
00:39:44,334 --> 00:39:45,933
Gentle.

714
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,834
"A man of words and not of deeds

715
00:39:48,868 --> 00:39:51,401
Is like a garden full of weeds."

716
00:39:53,033 --> 00:39:57,734
"And when the weeds begin to grow,

717
00:39:57,768 --> 00:40:00,401
It's like a garden full of snow."

718
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:04,701
"And when the snow begins to fall,

719
00:40:04,734 --> 00:40:06,667
It's like a bird upon the wall."

720
00:40:13,401 --> 00:40:16,634
"And when the bird away does fly,

721
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:19,801
It's like an eagle in the sky."

722
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,801
You bring out...

723
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:25,401
"And when the y begins to roar,

724
00:40:25,434 --> 00:40:27,634
It's like a lion at the door."

725
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:29,768
Hi.

726
00:40:29,801 --> 00:40:32,033
I have to tell you something.

727
00:40:40,967 --> 00:40:44,267
"And when the door begins to crack,

728
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:48,033
It's like a stick across your back."

729
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,501
"And when your back begins to smart..."

730
00:40:57,534 --> 00:41:00,501
Hey. You okay?

731
00:41:00,534 --> 00:41:04,300
"...It's like a penknife in your heart."

732
00:41:06,267 --> 00:41:08,134
Sam, this is my brother, "x."

733
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,200
Have a nice night?

734
00:41:24,701 --> 00:41:26,501
Have a bad night?

735
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,801
"And when your heart begins to bleed,

736
00:41:38,834 --> 00:41:40,667
"You're dead...

737
00:41:40,701 --> 00:41:42,234
And dead..."

738
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:45,367
... and dead indeed.
