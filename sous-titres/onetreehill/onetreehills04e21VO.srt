1
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,600
I killed my brother.

2
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,800
Her heart rate's dropping.

3
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,500
Come on, karen.
Just breathe.

4
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,900
Come on, haley,
just breathe.

5
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,900
You're doing good, baby.
You're doing so good.

6
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm right here.

7
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,800
Come on, mom.
I'm right here.

8
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,300
She coded.

9
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,300
Mom!

10
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,400
Karen?

11
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,900
Oh.

12
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,700
Yuck!

13
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Who's that?

14
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Don't you know?

15
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,200
She's our daughter.

16
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,700
Mommy! Daddy!
Come play with me!

17
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,500
Goodness.

18
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,000
What flower is this, mommy?

19
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,300
This is a lily.

20
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,400
Oh, she's beautiful.

21
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,300
Just like her mother.

22
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,400
Mommy, come with me.

23
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,100
You should go
watch over her.

24
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,500
I'll wait for you.

25
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,700
It's okay.

26
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,800
I'll be right here.

27
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,600
Come with me, mommy!

28
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,400
Look for me in the lilies.

29
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,000
Stats and vitals rising.

30
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,900
We got her back.

31
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,300
"Now is the time
for us to shine,

32
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,400
"The time when our dreams
are within reach

33
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,800
"And possibilities vast.

34
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,100
"Now is the time
for all of us...

35
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,800
...to become the people
we've always dreamed of being."

36
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,900
Aah!

37
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,700
"This is your world.
You're here."

38
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,200
It's a boy.

39
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,900
Ohh!

40
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,200
"You matter."

41
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,800
Oh, my god.

42
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,300
Just relax.

43
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
You're a dad!

44
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,600
You did so good.
You did so good.

45
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,100
We have a son.
We have a son.

46
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,500
I want to see him.

47
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,500
Hi.

48
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,000
Hi, baby.

49
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,600
"The world is waiting."

50
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,800
Welcome to the world,
james lucas scott.

51
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Look, that's your daddy.

52
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,200
He's so beautiful.

53
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,300
That's your daddy.

54
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,800
Unbelievable.

55
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,500
He's only mellow
when we play rap music?

56
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,400
What happened to the classical
music i played for nine months?

57
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,200
I got a confession to make.

58
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,200
Every time you fell asleep,
i went to old-School hip-Hop.

59
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,400
That's my boy, isn't it?
That's my boy.

60
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,800
You like some
old-School hip-Hop, huh?

61
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah.

62
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,700
Hi, keith.

63
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,800
It's us.

64
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,200
Her name is lily.

65
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,800
Lily roe scott.

66
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,400
Hi.

67
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm gonna be seeing you in her
every day.

68
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,800
You've got to be kidding me.
Again?

69
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I guess.

70
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,600
Huh.

71
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,800
Doesn't look like
anything's wrong.

72
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,600
You sure it won't start?

73
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,700
Peyton?

74
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,700
Oh, the car's fine.

75
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,100
I was just
feeling sentimental

76
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,000
About the first time
we spoke.

77
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,300
Feeling
sentimental,

78
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,200
Or avoiding packing

79
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,800
For your trip to los angeles
with brooke tomorrow?

80
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,500
I don't want to go.

81
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,100
<i>I mean, i do want to go.
I'm just --</i>

82
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,300
I'm gonna miss you.

83
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,500
Come on, look.

84
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,700
<i>At least you know
what you're gonna do.</i>

85
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,700
You still
haven't decided yet?

86
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,300
I just didn't see this
other thing coming, you know?

87
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,800
Can i help you?

88
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,600
I don't think so.

89
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,700
I just keep telling myself

90
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,200
That there will be some
significant moment

91
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,100
When i will know
what to do.

92
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,300
How about you?
Can i help you?

93
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,200
Yeah.

94
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,800
Remember when your mom
was in the hospital,

95
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,400
And you asked me just
to lie with you and heal you?

96
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Yeah.

97
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,100
I think i could use some
of that healing before tomorrow.

98
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,200
I can do that.

99
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,600
So, you know,
there's a big party tonight,

100
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,900
Kind of a last hurrah
for all the seniors.

101
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,600
I know, but what are we gonna do
with the baby?

102
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,400
Cue
the crazy grandmother.

103
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,500
And f.Y.I.,

104
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,000
If either of you ever calls me
"grandmother" in public,

105
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,200
I'll use my gun.

106
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,400
Which is at the range,

107
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Safe from the most beautiful
baby boy in the world.

108
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,300
Next to you, nathan,
of course.

109
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,100
<i>Oh, who am i kidding?
You are the cutest.</i>

110
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,400
You, you, you.

111
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,300
Go.
I'll watch him.

112
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Oh, i don't know.

113
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
We're underage, mom,

114
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,200
And there's gonna be
drinking, alcohol,

115
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,000
Probably some drugs.

116
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,500
You're going to the party,
and you're going to have fun.

117
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,400
<i>We insist.</i>

118
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
Now go.

119
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,200
Bring me home some drugs.

120
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,000
Isn't grandma funny?

121
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,300
Isn't she?

122
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,600
Wow.

123
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,300
So, what's the deal
with this party, anyway?

124
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,300
At midnight, the tree hill high
computers change over,

125
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,700
And the juniors
become seniors.

126
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,400
So, what happens to us?

127
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,400
We're gone.

128
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,300
I don't want
to be gone.

129
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,800
Well, you got
until midnight.

130
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Hey, let me
ask you guys something.

131
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,400
Does it look like
i'm wearing a blouse?

132
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,200
I like it.

133
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,200
Uh, it's a little...

134
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,300
Great.
I'm the blouse man.

135
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,800
It looks like i'm competing in
men's ice dancing, doesn't it?

136
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,400
<i>No, it looks like you're winning
men's ice dancing.</i>

137
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,900
Stop it.
It's fine.

138
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,800
I'm just playing.

139
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,300
As long as you don't have
wine coolers in that bag,

140
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,300
You're good.

141
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,800
You know what?
You guys go ahead.

142
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm gonna, uh,
grab my jacket.

143
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,000
Ahh.

144
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,100
Hey, listen.

145
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
I'm gonna stay
out of your way tonight

146
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,300
'Cause i know you got a lot
of people to say goodbye to£¿£¿

147
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,900
Before you leave tomorrow.

148
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,000
Maybe
i don't even have to go.

149
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,400
I mean,
what do interns do anyway?

150
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,800
They, like, answer phones.

151
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,700
I already know
how to answer phones.

152
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,900
Look -- Hello?

153
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,200
You're going,
and you're gonna have fun.

154
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,800
Okay, we'll have fun.

155
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,100
Just, maybe i should give deb
one quick call just to check in.

156
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Hales, come on,
i miss the boy, too,

157
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,900
But we're not gonna be
those crazy, obsessive parents.??

158
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,900
You need to enjoy one last night
with all your friends.

159
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,500
Okay, i won't call.

160
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,700
All right.
Tonight's gonna rock.

161
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,900
Tonight's gonna suck.

162
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
I can't believe
they're gonna erase us.

163
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
No, i see possibilities
in a night like this.

164
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,500
It's your last chance
to tell someone you love them,

165
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,300
Maybe apologize
to an old friend,

166
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,700
Try something new.

167
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,100
Tonight has greatness
written all over it.

168
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
I can feel it.

169
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Okay.

170
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,100
Name.

171
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,600
Brooke davis.

172
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,800
I'm sorry.

173
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,400
I've got strict orders
not to admit brooke davis.

174
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,600
Excuse me?

175
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,100
Whose stupid party
is this, anyway?

176
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,600
Mine, bitch.

177
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,400
And your fat ass
isn't invited.

178
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,900
Aah!

179
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Oh, my god.

180
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,100
Well, if it isn't
the only guy

181
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,700
<i>To ever leave me in a hotel room
before the sex.</i>

182
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,400
Well, well.
Come here.

183
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
Oh!

184
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,600
Where you been?
What are you doing here?

185
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,400
Well, where i've been's
a long story.

186
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,300
What i'm doing here's
pretty easy.

187
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,800
I missed you.

188
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,400
I missed you, too.

189
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,500
??Hang out with her
too long,

190
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,000
You're gonna end
up in honey grove.

191
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,800
I need to borrow you.

192
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,200
Come with me,
boy and friend.

193
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,200
Where???

194
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,200
Someone's playing
spin the bottle.

195
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,800
Spin the bottle?
What are we -- 13?

196
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,200
Shut up.
God.

197
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,600
Look, if you ask me,
it's really stupid

198
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,900
<i>That we all ever stopped
playing spin the bottle,</i>

199
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,800
So quit being so grumpy.

200
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,600
Hey, you'd be grumpy, too,
if a girl you had history with

201
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,500
Just showed up
out of the blue.

202
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Mouth.

203
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,600
You were saying?

204
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,800
Uh...

205
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,700
Hi.

206
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,400
Hey, deb, hi.
It's -- It's me.

207
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,700
I -- I'm sorry to bother you.
I just wanted to --

208
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,300
Check in, yeah.
Everything's great?

209
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,500
Great. Okay, good, good.
All right. Thanks.

210
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,300
Oh, also, can you
just not tell nathan that i,

211
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Um, th i called this time --
Or last time?

212
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,100
Thanks.

213
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,000
Also, uh, before you go,

214
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,000
He really likes his little...

215
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,500
Giraffe.

216
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,000
Ow!

217
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,800
That's foroaking me
at the last party.

218
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,100
The bitch slap, i deserved.

219
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,700
That's for flicking me
in the back of the head.

220
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,600
I'm gonna miss this.

221
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,600
Is that nathan scott, big-Time
college basketball player?

222
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,900
Small-Time
college basketball player.

223
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,600
Well, whatever, but...

224
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,300
Congratulations, man --
On everything.

225
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,000
How's fatherhood?

226
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,700
It's awesome.

227
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,800
How's brotherhood?

228
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Awesome.

229
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,400
She's beautiful, £¿£¿man.

230
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,700
Handsome kid.

231
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,100
Looks like his uncle.

232
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,100
We got to go see him.

233
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,900
Yeah, i know.

234
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,900
But what do you say
to your father the murderer?

235
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,600
Whatever we say,
we just get it over with.

236
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,100
I'm tired of carrying it around
and avoiding him.

237
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,600
Let's do it tonight.

238
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,600
Let's stop
running from him.

239
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,800
Okay.

240
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,400
Okay,
we'll go later tonight, then.

241
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,700
May need
a few drinks first.

242
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,500
Lucas...

243
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,700
I'm sorry
i didn't believe you.

244
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,800
I'm sorry i was right.

245
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,400
<i>Brooke davis,
look to your right,</i>

246
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,800
<i>And you'll see
the hottest guy at the party.</i>

247
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,800
Hey...

248
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,400
Hi, tutor mom.
How you feeling --

249
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,100
You having fun
or you worried about the kid?

250
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Um, i am...

251
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,700
Worried --
About you, too.

252
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,400
I'm gonna miss you
this summer.

253
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,900
Okay, don't.
Don't do that.

254
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,900
Don't make me cry

255
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,800
'Cause i'm barely
holding it together as it is.

256
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,500
Nathan and i want you
to be james' godmother.

257
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,100
Okay, that's gonna do it.

258
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
Haley.

259
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,300
I would be honored
to be his godmother,

260
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,300
And i promise you that,
unlike my ungodly mother,

261
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,200
I will so kick ass
at this.

262
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,300
I know you will --

263
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,200
As long as you don't say
"kick ass" around him too much.

264
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,700
Right, sorry.

265
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,600
Like your leather.
You're shelly, right?

266
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,500
Yeah. Uh, we had
current events together, right?

267
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,800
Right, yeah.

268
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,100
Hey,
i just want to tell you,

269
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,300
I think clean teens
is really cool.

270
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,600
Thanks.

271
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,200
I...
kind of ended it.

272
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,200
Oh.

273
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Well, it's
still really brave of you.

274
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,300
<i>I totally would have joined
if i didn't love sex so much.</i>

275
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,400
That's a joke.

276
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,300
Yeah.

277
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,100
Man, clean teen wardrobe
sure has changed.

278
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,600
I want back in.

279
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,400
Look at this.
It's like a clean teen reunion.

280
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,300
All we need now is chase, but
honestly, he's not that clean.

281
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,600
He appreciates
the art of a dirty text message.

282
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,800
I don't suppose
the clean teen dances much.

283
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,400
Oh, please.

284
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,300
I was doing the whole slut thing
long before you, bitch.

285
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,800
What?
It's catchy.

286
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,600
Mm-Hmm.

287
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,300
You believe in miracles,
skills?

288
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,700
'Cause there's no way in hell
a couple of vagabonds like us

289
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,100
Walked off the river court
and won the state championship.

290
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Yeah.

291
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:36,600
Hey, you know

292
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,900
My joint ain't too far
from u.N.C. This year, right?

293
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,800
We gonna be boys
for life.

294
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,400
Hey, you guys play
nathan and whitey next season?

295
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,000
December 9th, 3:00,

296
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,500
And i plan to score
at 3:01, 3:02, and 3:03.

297
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,900
-You gonna be there, right?
-We'll see.

298
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,600
"We'll see"?

299
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,700
??Kill all that
"boys for life" talk, dog.

300
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,700
Matter of fact,
we ain't even friends right now.

301
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,500
Right.??

302
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,200
Be right back.

303
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,100
All right.
Let's go see dan.

304
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,800
You sure?

305
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,700
Yeah, i'm sure.
Why? Aren't you?

306
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,000
I don't know.

307
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,500
Scott.

308
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Visitation.

309
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,800
I have a daughter.

310
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Her name is lily.

311
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,200
And someday,
when she's old enough,

312
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,500
She's gonna ask me
where her daddy is...

313
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,400
Who he was...

314
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,400
And how he died.

315
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And on that day,

316
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,100
I'm gonna look
into her beautiful eyes...

317
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,500
Eyes that don't know
of malice...

318
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And jealousy...

319
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,400
And evil...

320
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,800
And i'm gonna say...

321
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,700
"...Your father loved
his younger brother very much,

322
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,400
"And that brother took him
from you for your entire life.

323
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
He made sure you would never
know your father."

324
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:44,900
Karen.

325
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,700
£¿£¿

326
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,100
So, you ready
to leave tomorrow?

327
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,100
Hey, what's wrong?

328
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,400
I don't know.
I just, um...

329
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,900
I know
moving on is a good thing.

330
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,500
I guess i'm just scared.

331
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,000
You know?

332
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,900
High school's safe,

333
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,100
And i'm not sure
i'm ready for the real world.

334
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,500
Um...

335
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
For the past few months,
i've been writing this --

336
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,500
I guess in part
so i could remember it all.

337
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,900
But, um...

338
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,300
...here.

339
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,200
"She was
fiercely independent.

340
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,600
"Brooke davis...

341
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,100
"Brilliant
and beautiful and brave.

342
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,500
"In two years, she'd grown more
than anyone i had ever known.

343
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,200
"Brooke davis is gonna change
the world someday,

344
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
And i'm not sure
she even knows it."

345
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,800
You're gonna do great,
brooke.

346
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,100
The world
doesn't stand a chance.

347
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,300
Thank you.

348
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,600
Hey, shelly.
Nice moves.

349
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,700
Oh, thanks.

350
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,200
Hey, shelly...
nice skirt.

351
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,200
So, you gonna let me
slide you out of that

352
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,600
At church camp again
or what?

353
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,000
Come on...

354
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,000
Slut.

355
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,100
What did you say?

356
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,000
Mouth, it's okay.

357
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,700
No, it's not okay.

358
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,300
Oh, no?

359
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,100
Whatever, geek.

360
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,100
What are you doing?

361
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,500
Do you believe this?

362
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,200
You know,
i was gonna take it easy on --

363
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,400
Yeah, me, too.

364
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,700
He's sorry.
You look great.

365
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,400
Oh, my gosh.

366
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,700
Nathan,
your baby is so beautiful.

367
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,400
He is, isn't he?

368
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,300
Hi. Sorry.
Can we just have a second?

369
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
Congratulations,
haley.

370
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,300
Thank you, reese.

371
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,900
, we need to go home.
Why? What is it?

372
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,500
I know we promised
we wouldn't do this,

373
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,000
But i called
just to check in on the baby,

374
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,600
And deb's not answering the phone,
????

375
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,900
And she's not answering
her cellphone either.

376
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,200
Let's not freak out, okay?

377
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,700
It doesn't mean
my mom's not on top of it.

378
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,600
Your mom the former drug addict,
attempted murderer,

379
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,200
Who dropped a loaded gun
in the caf\?

380
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,100
It wouldn't hurt to check.

381
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,700
Right.

382
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,500
I thought about calling you
a million times.

383
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,800
Are you mad at me?

384
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,700
No.

385
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,200
I just stayed away
because you asked me to.

386
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,700
No, uh,
clean teen shirt, huh?

387
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,200
No.

388
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,300
It was time to end it.

389
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,700
I was just trying
to find my place, you know?

390
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,500
Yeah.

391
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,400
You'll always
be important to me, shelly.

392
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,800
Mouth.

393
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,300
I like the skirt.

394
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,700
Hey, you.
What have you been up to?

395
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,200
Flirting with lucas.

396
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,500
Oh, yeah?
How'd that turn out?

397
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,300
<i>Meh. So, so. Love triangles
are so high school.</i>

398
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,400
Seriously.

399
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,900
We made it, didn't we?

400
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,200
Through all the tragedy
and jealousy and confusion...

401
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,800
We made it.

402
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,200
Yeah.

403
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,000
Hos over bros, right?

404
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,300
I love you, p. Sawyer.

405
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,100
I love you, too,
b. Dav.

406
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,600
Almost midnight --
End of an era.

407
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,400
Four years of high school

408
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,800
And zero girlfriends
for junk and fergie.

409
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,300
My girlfriend's canadian.

410
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,100
Man, whatever.

411
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,100
What you
thinking about, marv?

412
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,000
I'll be right back.

413
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,900
Hey, mouth, what's --

414
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,700
Yeah, dog!
That's my dog!

415
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,000
I always wanted
to do that.

416
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,800
Sorry.

417
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,500
Um...did you --

418
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,000
<i>I-I said you could hang out.
I didn't say you could make out.</i>

419
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,800
Do you see what happens when
you leave me alone all night?

420
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,200
I mean, seriously,

421
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,400
Thank you for letting me
say goodbye to all my friends,

422
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,300
But you're the one
i want to finish the night with.

423
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,900
I was hoping
you were gonna say that.

424
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,400
How about you kiss me
till i have to leave tomorrow?

425
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,300
It's a start.

426
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,800
Come on.

427
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,200
Hmm.

428
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,600
Deb?

429
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,300
Mom?

430
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,500
Shh!

431
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
Mom, what happened
to the phone?

432
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:22,900
I unplugged it.

433
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,800
Why?

434
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,900
Because the two of you
were driving us crazy.

435
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,900
The two of us?

436
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,100
I might have called
a couple of times.

437
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,500
Six times.

438
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,400
You crazy, obsessive parent.

439
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,400
<i>You called eight.</i>

440
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,600
I missed him.

441
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,100
And he's fine.

442
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,800
But go back to the party
and have fun.

443
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,200
You have the rest of your lives
to worry about children.

444
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,500
Trust me.

445
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,400
All right.
You want to go back?

446
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,000
Yeah.
Hey, hold on a second.

447
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,200
You're gonna be a great mom,
you know that?

448
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,500
Actually,
you already are a great mother,

449
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,600
And that's very sexy.

450
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,200
Really?

451
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,900
We don't have to
go back right away.

452
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,100
You're absolutely right.

453
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,100
Did i mention is was
the greatest night of my life?

454
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,300
Well, you said it was a night to
be great and to try new things,

455
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,000
So i figured
we'd do both at once.

456
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,100
You're gonna change the world
someday, brooke davis.

457
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,100
Yeah, so i've been told.

458
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,700
Be gentle with me.

459
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,400
I don't want you to go.

460
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,300
What?

461
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,300
I'm sorry.
I just --

462
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,700
I've been trying
to put a good face on.

463
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,600
God, i love you so much,
peyton.

464
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,800
So you want me to stay?

465
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,000
Yeah.

466
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,800
Then i'll stay.

467
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,200
No, you won't.

468
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,400
Just --

469
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,800
I want you to stay.

470
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,300
But i n't let you.

471
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,400
And do you know why?

472
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,300
Because
i've told you before...

473
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,000
You are destined
for greatness.

474
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,000
And it starts
tomorrow morning.

475
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,200
It's not gonna matter
anyway --

476
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,300
Whether i stay or i go --
With us...

477
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,400
'Cause i'm gonna love you
forever, lucas scott.

478
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,800
Yeah, so am i.

479
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,300
Hey, where
have you guys been?

480
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,000
I don't know.
Around.

481
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,700
Hey, um,
you got a sec, luke?

482
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,900
Yeah.

483
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,500
All right,
let me see that baby.

484
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,000
Oh, god.

485
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,900
Not bad, huh?

486
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,300
Good work, buddy.

487
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,100
I made that.

488
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,500
So, tell me

489
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,400
That was the greatest
60 seconds of your life.

490
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,100
Stop.
It was great.

491
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,200
So great
you're gonna stay?

492
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,900
<i>Mmm...
not really that great.</i>

493
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,900
Suddenly i feel used.

494
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,600
But it's okay,

495
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,300
Considering
i've been used by brooke davis.

496
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,400
Shut up.

497
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,600
You know i'm lying.

498
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,900
I am gonna miss you.
I already do.

499
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,600
You've become
such a big part of my life,

500
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,300
Sometimes i think it's strange
that i didn't know you till now.

501
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,100
It's okay.

502
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,400
Put me in your heart
and go see everything, brooke.

503
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,700
And then come back to me.

504
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
I'm sad.

505
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,200
I am sad. I --

506
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,700
It just hit me today

507
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,700
That you and i have been
together

508
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,500
Pretty much
every day of our lives,

509
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,000
And we're gonna
have to say goodbye soon.

510
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,800
We're not gonna --

511
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,700
Hales.

512
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,000
Look, i just -- I really want
you to know that i love you

513
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,400
And there's a reason why
our son's middle name is lucas.

514
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,700
You had keith,
and james is gonna have you.

515
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
And, um...

516
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,300
Nathan and i would like
for his uncle lucas

517
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,400
To also be his godfather.

518
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,300
Thank you.

519
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,600
I would love to.

520
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:06,700
I just --

521
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,900
I hope he learns how to
follow his heart like you do.

522
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,500
I'm really
gonna miss you, luke.

523
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,600
No, you're not.

524
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,600
What do you mean?
What's so funny?

525
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
Do you want
to hear a secret?

526
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,500
Oh, luke.

527
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,800
Hey.

528
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,000
Where you been?

529
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,500
Having sex.

530
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,900
You're funny.

531
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,000
Um...

532
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,900
I have something for you.

533
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,100
Turner gave it to me.

534
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,300
Happy graduation.

535
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,900
You told him the truth,
didn't you?

536
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,700
Maybe.

537
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,800
You know, of all the schools
i got suspended from...

538
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,300
I'm glad
i graduated from this one.

539
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,000
Me too.

540
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,300
I've been thinking
about dan.

541
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:42,700
Yeah?

542
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,800
Why should we go see him?

543
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,500
You mean tonight?

544
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,300
No, i mean --
I mean at all.

545
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,300
I mean...

546
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,700
He's had control over us since
we were born.

547
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,300
These are our lives,
not his.

548
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,600
I say
we go on without him.

549
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,300
I say...

550
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,000
<i>We never go see him.</i>

551
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,800
Ever.

552
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,800
I know it sounds horrible
to say, but, uh...

553
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,100
I'm okay with that.

554
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I mean, i got a great wife,
i got a beautiful baby son,

555
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,200
And i got
a hell of a brother.

556
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,300
Yeah...

557
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,600
Hell of a brother who's...

558
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,000
Gonna be your coach.

559
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,200
Whitey offered me
an assistant-Coaching job.

560
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,600
I'm gonna take it.

561
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,900
What?
When did you decide this?

562
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,700
About the same time
i became a godfather.

563
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,800
That's great, man.
We'll do it together.

564
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,300
By the way, make sure
you play well on december 9th.

565
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:52,900
If skills beats us,

566
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,400
He's never gonna let us hear
the end of it.

567
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,300
Yeah.

568
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,100
12...11...10...9...8...

569
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,900
What's going on?

570
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,200
It's almost
midnight.

571
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,500
...5...4...3...2...1!

572
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,600
We're seniors!

573
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,900
Oh, high-School kids.

574
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,800
Let's get out of here,
you guys.

575
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:05,800
Where to?

576
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,800
I know a place
open all night.

577
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,200
Let's roll.

578
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,400
Girls versus boys!

579
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,700
Sorry, guys.

580
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,900
Ah, ah, ah

581
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,900
Okay.

582
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,100
We're not gonna do this.

583
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,900
We're not gonna get sad.
Nothing's gonna change now.

584
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,300
We'll all be friends forever.
I know it.

585
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,000
Look, in four years,
we're gonna be right back here.

586
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,400
You know,
done with college or...

587
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,200
Wherever we go.

588
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,400
Right?

589
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,300
Yeah.

590
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,400
Hey.

591
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,400
Ready for a rematch, or you
afraid you're gonna get worked?

592
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,100
Oh, ho, ho.

593
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,200
Do you really want
to end your night with a loss?

594
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,100
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

595
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,200
And welcome
to another historic night.

596
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,100
You sure
you're up for this, old man?

597
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,800
I could do this forever,
little brother.
