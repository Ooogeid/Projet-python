1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:01,731
<i>Previously on "one tree hill"...</i>

2
00:00:02,047 --> 00:00:04,251
Where to ?
Your place.

3
00:00:04,334 --> 00:00:05,885
Clay, quinn is haley's sister.

4
00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:07,418
She has a lot going on right now.

5
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:09,751
Stay away from her.

6
00:00:09,834 --> 00:00:13,017
You were a huge hit last night.
They think you're amazing.

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,351
You don't think i look like
"a frumpy whore on bingo night ?"

8
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:17,684
No !

9
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,451
If i did, would i ask you
to model full time ?

10
00:00:19,534 --> 00:00:21,917
Honey, i'm home.
Let's do this.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,451
I told you it was realistic.

12
00:00:23,534 --> 00:00:25,084
Hey, honey.

13
00:00:25,167 --> 00:00:26,618
Alex and i worked everything out.

14
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:27,718
Isn't that great ?

15
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:29,184
Dan : "nathan scott :

16
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:31,084
A basketball star's love child."

17
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:33,084
Like father, like son, huh ?

18
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:34,351
She's just so certain.

19
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,117
You don't remember
meeting her at all or... ?

20
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,184
You're actually starting
to believe her, aren't you ?

21
00:00:38,267 --> 00:00:40,584
I heard about your problem.
I was wondering if i could...

22
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:42,050
you could what, help ?

23
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:43,917
You save your help
for people who don't know you

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,367
And stay away from me and my family.

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,217
You've reached renee.
Leave a message.

26
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,551
I trust you had a nice flight.

27
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:54,234
I have a proposition for you.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,384
Okay, folks.
That's a wrap !

29
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:07,784
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

30
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,951
Um, we, uh we haven't
even shot anything yet.

31
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:12,485
You might want to call
your agent, son.

32
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:14,384
You're serious ?

33
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:15,917
Hey ! Whoa.

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What a pity.
I just found my motivation.

35
00:01:36,367 --> 00:01:39,251
This hot body of yours
has just inspired me

36
00:01:39,334 --> 00:01:42,284
To do something
that i've never done before.

37
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:44,151
Oh, yeah ?
Yeah.

38
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:47,084
And it's gonna take
a lot of hard work,

39
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:51,100
And it's gonna take
a long, long time.

40
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:55,601
And i'm gonna need you to start
by taking your pants off.

41
00:01:57,234 --> 00:02:00,951
Oh, that sounds amazing.

42
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:03,351
But alex is coming over to work.

43
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,917
You two were up half the night.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,100
It's all business, brooke.

45
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,218
I don't know. She seems to have
really come around.

46
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,318
I don't buy it.

47
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:18,984
Once a ho bag, always a ho bag.

48
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:21,750
Now, as i recall, you...

49
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:25,151
You might want to consider
what you are about to say

50
00:02:25,234 --> 00:02:26,767
Very carefully.

51
00:02:30,434 --> 00:02:33,334
Now come kiss me
till ho bag shows up.

52
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,585
You're up early.

53
00:02:49,668 --> 00:02:50,784
My shot at peace and quiet...

54
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:52,384
The west coast wakes up
in three hours,

55
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:54,017
And my phone starts ringing. Nice.

56
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,817
Did you come down for a swim ?

57
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,284
Yeah, i tried but, uh, couldn't.

58
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:01,218
I've been afraid of the ocean
since i was a little girl.

59
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:03,351
Mm. Sharks.

60
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:04,568
Immensity.

61
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:09,051
You know, i thought
if i just threw myself in and...

62
00:03:09,134 --> 00:03:11,084
Well...
it didn't quite work out.

63
00:03:11,683 --> 00:03:13,999
You should start smaller,
like a toe.

64
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:16,650
Work up to an ankle,
maybe even a shin. Who knows ?

65
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:19,384
Yeah, i'm more of a "yank
the band-aid" kind of girl.

66
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:20,829
Wait.

67
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:23,926
Go. It's fine.

68
00:03:24,991 --> 00:03:26,090
Hey, man.

69
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,668
Oh, just relax, all right ?
I...

70
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:33,084
Okay, i'll get into it.

71
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:35,384
Yeah, fine.
I'll meet you at your place.

72
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:38,684
Time to find a phone booth

73
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:40,784
And change into
that super-agent costume.

74
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:42,817
Yeah, if only it were that easy.

75
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,384
Um, i hate to run, but...

76
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:45,518
Go.
Save the day.

77
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,767
Okay. See ya.

78
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,167

Oh, no.

79
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,518
Oh... no.

80
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:11,900
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

81
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,518
I never called marvin !

82
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:18,485
Keep it down, giselle.
I'm trtrying to write.

83
00:04:18,568 --> 00:04:20,284
Besides, i thought
you were mad at him.

84
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:23,485
I was "ignore him
for a couple of hours" mad,

85
00:04:23,568 --> 00:04:26,184
Not "disappear for the second
night in a row" mad.

86
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,884
Well, you can thank me later,
but you were way drunk,

87
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:30,617
So i texted him from your phone

88
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,000
And let him know you were safe.

89
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:36,670
"Melvin...

90
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:40,284
"got my drink on with alex.

91
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:42,218
"If you're done being a tool,

92
00:04:42,301 --> 00:04:44,901
You should come rock out
with your co..."

93
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:47,384
Oh, my god.

94
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:49,585
Nope, just little old me.

95
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:52,201
But i do work in mysterious ways.

96
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:56,951
So you want me to go on your show

97
00:04:57,034 --> 00:04:58,418
And tell the world my story ?

98
00:04:58,501 --> 00:04:59,917
Dan : that's right.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,817
And you're gonna be on my side ?

100
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,284
Why would you do that ?

101
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:06,401
Nathan's your son.
It could ruin him.

102
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:10,585
But you're the one
telling the truth.

103
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:12,518
Haley :
you're not telling the truth.

104
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:14,084
About what ?

105
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:15,485
Renee.

106
00:05:15,568 --> 00:05:18,717
You said you didn't know her
and you didn't remember her.

107
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,118
I don't.

108
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:21,884
Haley, we've been through this.

109
00:05:21,967 --> 00:05:23,884
Why can't you just believe me ?

110
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:27,100
Her number is all over
your old cellphone bill.

111
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,118
Nathan !

112
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,518
Excuse me...

113
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:38,518
Why aren't you explaining yourself ?

114
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:40,351
Because i shouldn't have to.

115
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:41,817
But if you insist...

116
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,650
I'm a professional
basketball player.

117
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:45,585
Girls get ahold of my e-mail,
my telephone number.

118
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:47,118
They try to contact me.

119
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:50,118
And when they do, i reply
to them and tell them to stop

120
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:53,534
Because i'm happily married to
a woman who loves and trusts me.

121
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,284
So i guess i did lie, haley...

122
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:01,034
But only when i told them
that my wife trusts me.

123
00:06:19,034 --> 00:06:20,450
Marvin.

124
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:21,984
Don't you mean "melvin" ?

125
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:24,350
Please don't be mad even though
you have every right to be.

126
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:26,084
Alex called me
after she left julian's,

127
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:27,818
And i was kind of already drinking

128
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:30,417
Because i thought you didn't think
i was pretty enough to be a model.

129
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,918
When did i say
you weren't pretty enough ?

130
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:33,118
Of course you're pretty enough.

131
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:34,784
Then maybe we could skip
the whole fight

132
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:36,751
And you could just be
really excited for me,

133
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:38,118
Because... it's official...

134
00:06:38,201 --> 00:06:40,533
You're looking at the newest
face of clothes over bros !

135
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:43,218
<i>Oh, well, not this face.</i>

136
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:45,784
But once it's cleaned up
with a little makeup...

137
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:47,918
Congratulations, millie.

138
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:50,285
I just wish i was the one
you wanted to celebrate with.

139
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,551
Anyway, you'll understand if i
can't stay and rock out with my...

140
00:06:52,634 --> 00:06:54,617
Marvin !

141
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,984
That was alex.

142
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:57,517
Of course it was.

143
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,751
<i>Well, at least she texted me.</i>

144
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:01,734
I got to go.

145
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:08,951
Clay : this situation's
like a war, nate.

146
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:10,517
We're gonna lose a few battles.

147
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,951
Just stop with the metaphors

148
00:07:12,034 --> 00:07:14,051
And tell me what the hell
happened this morning.

149
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,433
Simile.

150
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:21,551
What ? Similes use "like"
or "as"... "like a war."

151
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:22,834
Guys.

152
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:26,884
We lost the rainstorm
body spray campaign,

153
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:28,951
And it looks like
the shoe deal's going away.

154
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:31,551
What ?
Temporarily.

155
00:07:31,634 --> 00:07:32,818
This is unbelievable.

156
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:34,651
I know it feels like
the sky is falling,

157
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:36,317
But when something
like this goes down,

158
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,918
Marketing executives
distance themselves

159
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:39,078
To protect their brands.

160
00:07:39,161 --> 00:07:40,185
All right, almost always,

161
00:07:40,268 --> 00:07:41,717
They come back
as soon as the air clears.

162
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,918
"Almost always" ?

163
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:44,851
Look, we knew there was a risk

164
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:46,918
When we decided not to deal
with renee,

165
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:49,450
But it has become a bit
of an issue with the bobcats.

166
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:50,717
They don't want me back ?

167
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,450
No, you are far too talented
for that,

168
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:54,118
But they're using it
to their advantage,

169
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:55,450
And negotiations have slowed.

170
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:57,317
Again, like i said,
we expected this.

171
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,350
More importantly, nate,

172
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:01,151
The whole agency's
on this, all right ?

173
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:03,218
Everybody respects your decision
to fight this,

174
00:08:03,301 --> 00:08:04,751
And we've got your back.

175
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:06,984
You just got to have
some faith in us...

176
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:09,001
And in each other.

177
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:16,937
Clay.

178
00:08:18,301 --> 00:08:20,551
He's gonna have a career
when this is over, right ?

179
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:23,018
Haley, i'm not gonna let
anything happen to him.

180
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:25,051
Because you didn't see
how dark he got the first time.

181
00:08:25,134 --> 00:08:26,717
Look, this is a staring contest.

182
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,818
Our best chance
at having her blink first

183
00:08:28,901 --> 00:08:30,517
Is if the press gets tired of this

184
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,317
And nobody makes this story
any bigger than it already is.

185
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,500
Dan : i'm gonna make
this story huge.

186
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,951
But you don't trust me.

187
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:43,851
I'd have to hate my son
to tell your story, right ?

188
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:47,118
You're smart.
I like that.

189
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:50,118
That means
my grandchild will be smart.

190
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:54,617
Well, i was
in nathan's situation once.

191
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,517
I refused to recognize
a child that i'd fathered,

192
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,317
And it was the second-worst
mistake i ever made,

193
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,918
But i made it in part
because nobody forced me

194
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,317
To look at the consequences
of my actions.

195
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,317
By coming out in support of you

196
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,717
And allowing you to tell your story,

197
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,285
I'll be forcing nathan
to take responsibility...

198
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:17,600
If not emotionally,
then at least financially.

199
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:21,727
He'll never forgive you.

200
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:25,413
I've made my peace with that.

201
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:35,285
There she is.

202
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:37,118
I know... i'm late again,

203
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,784
And we still haven't finished
- - calliope : the inventory.

204
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:41,533
I also found that shipment
that went missing in new mexico,

205
00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:43,350
Balanced the register
from yesterday,

206
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:46,185
And took the liberty of ordering
some bellissimo fabrics from milan.

207
00:09:46,268 --> 00:09:47,484
You're gonna love them.

208
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:48,901
I can't wait.

209
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:53,218
Isn't she amazing ?

210
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,818
<i>Um, i guess, but that's my job.</i>

211
00:09:55,901 --> 00:09:57,617
Not anymore, miss thing.

212
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,851
The fashion blogs
are still buzzing about you.

213
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,918
You are officially a model.

214
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:06,884
Your only job now
is to worry about being pretty.

215
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:10,185
You... you might want to worry
just a smidge more.

216
00:10:10,268 --> 00:10:13,018
I know.
I was out late.

217
00:10:13,101 --> 00:10:15,617
And, brooke, i am excellent
at multitasking,

218
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,651
And i'd be happy to keep my
administrative responsibilities.

219
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:20,317
Nonsense.

220
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,651
I am not gonna have the new face
of my company doing dirty work.

221
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:24,818
Now off you go.

222
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:27,151
Do whatever models do
in their spare time.

223
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:30,185
Just be back this afternoon
for a swimsuit fitting.

224
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:31,916
Swimsuits ?
Mm.

225
00:10:32,618 --> 00:10:33,688
Wow.

226
00:10:33,992 --> 00:10:35,018
Okay.

227
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,185
I mean... great !

228
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,551
Oh...

229
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:38,967
Welcome to clothes over bros.

230
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:45,784
Hey, man, how you doing ?

231
00:10:45,867 --> 00:10:48,251
I'm doing better than nathan scott.

232
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:50,285
I mean, that dude
can't catch a break.

233
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:52,285
What do you mean ?

234
00:10:52,368 --> 00:10:54,051
You haven't checked the board.

235
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:57,684
Oh, god, mouth...

236
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,317
He's losing his endorsements.

237
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,600
Sports is breaking the story
tonight at 6 : 00.

238
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:06,218
If charlie asks for me,
tell him i'm...

239
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:07,533
I'll be back later.

240
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:23,884
Clay !

241
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:26,084
Hey.
Hey.

242
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:28,667
What, did you run
into some kryptonite ?

243
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:34,450
You need a friend ?

244
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:36,617
You have no idea.

245
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,901
Come on.

246
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,285
Seriously,
you've been reading forever.

247
00:11:52,368 --> 00:11:54,350
Look, some of it's
supposed to be funny.

248
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:56,717
You're not laughing.
You're not even smiling.

249
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,247
Maybe i'm laughing on the inside.

250
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,384
Are you ?

251
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:00,551
You're not.

252
00:12:00,634 --> 00:12:01,984
You're like,

253
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:04,185
"wow, does she suck," on the inside.

254
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:05,600
You're like, "she..."

255
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:12,984
This is good.

256
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:14,285
Like "i hate it,

257
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:16,384
But there's a story
in there somewhere" good ?

258
00:12:16,467 --> 00:12:18,884
No. These scenes
are genuinely good...

259
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:21,684
Sweet, subtle, funny.

260
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:23,051
Where did this come from ?

261
00:12:23,134 --> 00:12:25,484
Well, i woke up,

262
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:27,285
And i was watching millicent sleep.

263
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:29,084
And she was, like, totally busted.

264
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:31,118
So i asked myself
what it would be like

265
00:12:31,201 --> 00:12:33,617
<i>if i was that tragic,
with, like, no self-confidence.</i>

266
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,734
And then i just added a boy.

267
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:39,067
Who are you ?

268
00:12:41,234 --> 00:12:42,717
Stick around.
Maybe you'll find out.

269
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,317
Unfortunately, i can't stick around,

270
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,484
Because you are three hours late,

271
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:46,884
And i have to meet brooke for lunch.

272
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,918
Oh ! Come on.
Tell her we're on a roll.

273
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,368
Um, no.

274
00:12:50,467 --> 00:12:52,818
She's already a little jealous
of our working relationship,

275
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:54,350
But maybe we can
meet back up tonight.

276
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:56,185
It's a date.
No.

277
00:12:56,268 --> 00:12:58,018
Date-ish ?
Work.

278
00:12:58,101 --> 00:13:00,368
Work... date.

279
00:13:09,901 --> 00:13:12,918
We can still pay her.

280
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,617
For what ?
The story's already out there.

281
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,684
For a retraction.

282
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:19,851
The money she wants
is a drop in the bucket

283
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:21,918
Compared to the rest of your career.

284
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,517
It's too late for that.

285
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,818
Nathan, you're being stubborn,

286
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:27,151
And i know
i was against it at first,

287
00:13:27,234 --> 00:13:28,551
But if she were to get out there

288
00:13:28,634 --> 00:13:29,884
And say that this whole thing
has been a lie...

289
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:31,684
We're not paying her, haley !

290
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:36,134
We're not giving this woman
a dime of our money.

291
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,517
Quinn : you're really worried
about this.

292
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,700
There's just so much riding on it.

293
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,867
Quinn, i'm not in tree hill
for a vacation.

294
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:03,784
A while back,
i went off the rails a bit...

295
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:06,384
Emotionally, and...

296
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:08,717
Luckily i had earned
enough capital with the agency

297
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,018
That they didn't fire me.

298
00:14:10,101 --> 00:14:11,918
They just scaled back
my client roster

299
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:14,551
And suggested
i spend the summer here...

300
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:16,634
Pull myself together.

301
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:22,218
And then nathan's scandal happened.

302
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:24,500
So the calm, cool exterior...

303
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,400
Is kind of a lie.

304
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,784
Just when i was beginning to wonder

305
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:32,134
If we had anything in common.

306
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:41,051
Quinn, i shouldn't be here.

307
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:42,818
Nathan doesn't want us hanging out,

308
00:14:42,901 --> 00:14:44,417
And i, uh, i have to respect that.

309
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,251
No, look, clay...

310
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:47,918
I'm sorry.

311
00:14:48,001 --> 00:14:50,818
Uh, thank you for this.

312
00:14:50,901 --> 00:14:52,951
I mean that.

313
00:14:53,034 --> 00:14:55,734
You're really great.

314
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:18,751
Chase...

315
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,185
What brings you in ?

316
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:23,051
Hey. Uh, just doing
a little shopping for mia.

317
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,984
You guys have been together
a long time.

318
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:27,918
Mm-hmm.
What about you ?

319
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:31,018
I heard julian moved here.
That must be... awesome.

320
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:32,384
Uh-huh.

321
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:34,751
Or not so awesome ?

322
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,484
No.
It's amazing.

323
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,018
I'm just a little annoyed

324
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:40,484
Because at first
i had him all to myself,

325
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:43,450
And lately he has been working
with one of my models.

326
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:45,851
Mm.
Well, i wouldn't worry.

327
00:15:45,934 --> 00:15:47,617
I'm sure it's harmless.

328
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,818
I mean, guys, you know,
don't even really...

329
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:53,400
Like... models.

330
00:15:57,234 --> 00:15:59,118
What are you doing today ?

331
00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:00,417
That depends

332
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,567
On why you're looking at me
like a piece of steak.

333
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:06,450
I would have offered to spot you,

334
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,433
But i max out at like 180... ish.

335
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:12,751
You know, i don't believe
in killing the messenger, mouth,

336
00:16:12,834 --> 00:16:16,818
But every time i've seen you
lately, it's been bad news.

337
00:16:16,901 --> 00:16:18,851
They're running a story at 6 : 00

338
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:21,450
That says you're losing
your endorsements.

339
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:22,617
Is it true ?

340
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,450
Yeah.

341
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:26,651
I'm sorry, nate.

342
00:16:26,734 --> 00:16:28,751
Yeah, me too.

343
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:30,251
I heard about your demotion.

344
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:33,051
How long are they gonna keep you
locked up in the basement ?

345
00:16:33,134 --> 00:16:34,151
The truth ?

346
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:36,084
Till i do a story on you.

347
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:37,784
Then do the story, mouth.

348
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:39,285
Nate... i'm serious, mouth.

349
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:42,185
You've already done
far more than i could ever ask.

350
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,700
Take care of your career.

351
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:50,185
And then he finally looks up,
and he's like,

352
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:51,384
"after reading this,

353
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:53,717
I think we should be
in a relationship."

354
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,185
He said that... "relationship" ?

355
00:16:56,268 --> 00:16:58,084
Well, i mean, he put "working"
in front of it,

356
00:16:58,167 --> 00:16:59,717
But a relationship
is a relationship.

357
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,517
Except in a working relationship,

358
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,350
You never, under any circumstances,

359
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:06,218
No matter how tempted you are,
have sex with the other person.

360
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:08,417
You're aware of that, right ?

361
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,084
I think that's sort of a gray area.

362
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:12,118
It's actually black-and-white,

363
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:14,151
Crystal-clear, written in stone.

364
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:16,417
Fine, crabby.
Whatever !

365
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,717
Sorry.

366
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,251
It's just brooke's my friend,

367
00:17:19,334 --> 00:17:21,350
Even if she did give my job
to calliope.

368
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:23,584
Tell me you are not regretting
your decision.

369
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,251
This modeling stuff is awesome.

370
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:30,051
I mean, it's hard work,
but it's "pretty people" work.

371
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:32,218
I don't know.
I was good at my job.

372
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,484
Administrative work
is for fatties, millicent,

373
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,484
And you are not a fatty.

374
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:37,951
You...

375
00:17:38,034 --> 00:17:40,001
Are a plus-size model.

376
00:17:52,901 --> 00:17:55,717
I take it you looked
at nathan's phone bill.

377
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,185
<i>If i pay you, what do i get ?</i>

378
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:01,218
I go away.

379
00:18:01,301 --> 00:18:03,384
No, i'm sorry.
That's not good enough.

380
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:04,617
I want a retraction.

381
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,051
I want a public letter

382
00:18:06,134 --> 00:18:08,517
That says this whole thing
has been a lie.

383
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,517
Fine, if that's what
will help you sleep at night,

384
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,151
But it won't be the truth.

385
00:18:13,234 --> 00:18:14,684
And the price has gone up...

386
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:16,285
$250,000.

387
00:18:16,368 --> 00:18:17,851
That's crazy.

388
00:18:17,934 --> 00:18:19,818
Actually, that's the estimated price

389
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:22,350
Of raising your husband's child
until the age of 18.

390
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:24,067
Do we have a deal ?

391
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:27,018
I'll tell you what.

392
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:29,517
You can have until 8 : 00 tonight
to decide.

393
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,433
After that, i have other options.

394
00:18:44,134 --> 00:18:45,201
Brooke !

395
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:49,034
Hello !

396
00:18:58,368 --> 00:19:00,084
One sec.

397
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:01,700
Got it.

398
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:05,600
Can i borrow you ?
Mm.

399
00:19:09,368 --> 00:19:11,384
Want to tell me why you were
mounting your ex-boyfriend

400
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:12,684
In the back room ?

401
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,118
Because you weren't available.

402
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:15,584
Very funny.

403
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,384
I'm serious.

404
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:21,918
This morning i looked over
at this big, sexy body,

405
00:19:22,001 --> 00:19:23,450
And i thought to myself,

406
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:26,517
"why aren't you making
men's clothes, brooke davis ?"

407
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,151
<i>Mm-hmm.
Clothes for bros ?</i>

408
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,350
Ka-ching !

409
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:32,317
But in order to make men's clothes,

410
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,350
You need a fit model
for measurements.

411
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:37,951
You were my first choice,
but, alas...

412
00:19:38,034 --> 00:19:39,584
I was busy with alex.
I get it.

413
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:40,984
Well, i'm here now,

414
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:43,051
And i'm all about
taking my clothes off for you

415
00:19:43,134 --> 00:19:44,317
In the back room,

416
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,317
So you can send
your little boy toy packing.

417
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,784
You're very sweet,

418
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,651
But i think
i'm gonna stick with chase.

419
00:19:49,734 --> 00:19:52,517
I'm already halfway through
his measurements.

420
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,667
But don't worry, baby.
We're all business.

421
00:19:58,067 --> 00:19:59,551
Hey, chase, break's over !

422
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:01,967
Drop your pants.

423
00:20:06,201 --> 00:20:08,584
I want back on the air.

424
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,784
I obviously have an opinion,

425
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:12,851
But at the end of the day,
i work for you.

426
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:15,584
You are aware of what's
on the board for tonight ?

427
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:17,584
Yeah, nathan scott's
losing his endorsements.

428
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,600
I took the liberty
of getting a quote from him.

429
00:20:28,318 --> 00:20:29,318
Nice work.

430
00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:33,101
Glad to hear you've come around.

431
00:20:41,034 --> 00:20:42,151
Don't.
It's the press.

432
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:43,600
They've been calling all day.

433
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:48,234
Beat it, nerds.

434
00:20:50,092 --> 00:20:51,651
Thanks.

435
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:53,251
You're welcome.

436
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:55,018
And as a favor, it would be great

437
00:20:55,101 --> 00:20:57,084
If you wouldn't give clay
such a hard time

438
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:58,450
About hanging out with me.

439
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:00,350
I'm not a child anymore, nathan.

440
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:02,084
Are you sure about that ?

441
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:04,951
What's that supposed to mean ?
I don't know.

442
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:08,617
Running away from your problems
just doesn't seem very adult.

443
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,368
Says the guy who's afraid
to answer the telephone.

444
00:21:14,134 --> 00:21:17,185
Look... if you want to sleep around,

445
00:21:17,268 --> 00:21:18,984
I'm sure there's plenty
of guys in tree hill

446
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:20,584
Who aren't responsible for my career

447
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:22,317
That could probably
help you out with that.

448
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,285
You ever hear the one about
people who live in glass houses ?

449
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:26,450
Yeah, i have.

450
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:28,417
And if you don't like
living in mine,

451
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,984
You'll welcome to move back in
with your husband.

452
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:32,784
Nice, nathan.

453
00:21:32,867 --> 00:21:35,384
You know, speaking of running
away from your problems,

454
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:37,800
Maybe you should try answering
one of those, coward.

455
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:52,317
I know you love to say
zero is not a size,

456
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,800
<i>but technically zero is my size,
and those are granny panties.</i>

457
00:21:58,134 --> 00:22:00,185
<i>These are a zero.</i>

458
00:22:00,268 --> 00:22:01,717
Really ?

459
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,818
My diet pills must be working.

460
00:22:03,901 --> 00:22:04,784
<i>Your vitamins ?</i>

461
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:05,951
What ?

462
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,218
Oh, right.

463
00:22:07,301 --> 00:22:08,334
Vitamins.

464
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:11,584
Okay.

465
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:12,818
Whatever.

466
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:15,818
I'll...
see if i can take these in.

467
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:16,984
Great.

468
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:18,617
Oh, and speaking of my perfect ass,

469
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,251
I understand from julian

470
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:23,551
You might be a little concerned
about our relationship.

471
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,185
<i>Working relationship.</i>

472
00:22:26,843 --> 00:22:29,417
You have nothing to worry about...

473
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,591
Seriously.

474
00:22:30,674 --> 00:22:32,417
I mean, i stripped naked,

475
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,285
And that boy didn't even flinch.

476
00:22:34,368 --> 00:22:35,934
<i>He is clearly so in love with you.</i>

477
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,517
Well, you're not chase.

478
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,871
If only.

479
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:59,484
I asked the waitress
if there was a tall, dark,

480
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:01,285
And handsome boy
waiting for his date.

481
00:23:01,368 --> 00:23:02,818
She pointed me here.

482
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:06,018
Sorry to disappoint, but your
"tall, dark, and handsome"

483
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:08,751
Is getting naked with
my "short, hot, and bossy."

484
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:09,951
Huh ?

485
00:23:10,034 --> 00:23:12,118
He's doing some fit modeling
for brooke

486
00:23:12,201 --> 00:23:13,884
At clothes over bros.

487
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:15,751
It's harmless.

488
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:17,067
I hope.

489
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,984
Hey, can i ask you something ?

490
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,584
Lose the shirt.
I'll go get a tape measure.

491
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:26,617
No, actually, it's about
being a songwriter.

492
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,851
Do you ever meet people on tour

493
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:31,251
That surprise you
with their talent ?

494
00:23:31,334 --> 00:23:32,784
I mean, uh...

495
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:36,151
You know, somebody
who seems simple or goofy

496
00:23:36,234 --> 00:23:38,717
Or even ditzy, and then... bam...

497
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,984
All of a sudden, they write
this amazing song ?

498
00:23:41,067 --> 00:23:43,301
Hi. I'm mia.

499
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:46,450
No, you're not like that at all.

500
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:50,517
Maybe not,
but i used to be really shy.

501
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,384
And i think sometimes
all somebody needs

502
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:55,984
Is someone to look
a little deeper...

503
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,700
Unlock their potential,
like haley did with me.

504
00:24:01,234 --> 00:24:04,167
Was that answer worth lunch
?'cause i'm kind of starving.

505
00:24:06,134 --> 00:24:07,500
On me.

506
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:13,285
Baby, you are a genius.

507
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:17,551
The interest in the interview
with renee is off the charts.

508
00:24:17,634 --> 00:24:20,134
You're not having
second thoughts, are you ?

509
00:24:22,034 --> 00:24:24,084
Dan, nathan had a chance

510
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:25,484
To take responsibility
for this child,

511
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:27,118
And he chose not to.

512
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:30,684
Giving this girl a voice
is the right thing to do.

513
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:32,884
Well, we don't have a show
unless renee agrees,

514
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:35,185
And i haven't heard from her
since this morning.

515
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:43,634
You just leave that up to me.

516
00:24:58,767 --> 00:25:02,218
It doesn't matter where i go,
you always seem to find me.

517
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:04,484
I just follow all the other girls.

518
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:06,717
They lead me right to you.

519
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,818
It hasn't been easy lately.

520
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:12,467
Then i guess
it's a good thing i'm here.

521
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:18,551
How'd you like
to stay the night tonight ?

522
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:19,951
Like old times.

523
00:25:20,034 --> 00:25:21,350
Well...

524
00:25:21,433 --> 00:25:24,301
That's up to you, isn't it ?

525
00:25:45,034 --> 00:25:46,934
I called renee.

526
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:49,884
What ?

527
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:54,967
She said for $250,000,
she would sign a retraction.

528
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:58,551
Amazing...

529
00:25:58,634 --> 00:26:00,151
The economy's crumbling,

530
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:02,717
And the truth keeps getting
more expensive.

531
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,317
Well, she's willing to say
this whole thing was a lie,

532
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,653
So...

533
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:09,617
You willing to believe it ?

534
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,051
I didn't come out here to ask
for your permission, nathan.

535
00:26:12,134 --> 00:26:15,067
I came here to tell you
that i'm paying her.

536
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,851
Are you okay ?

537
00:26:34,934 --> 00:26:36,618
No, i'm not okay !

538
00:26:36,701 --> 00:26:39,951
Ho bag got naked in
front of julian !

539
00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:41,584
"Ho bag" ?

540
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:45,284
Alex "my butt is the size
of a kumquat" dupr ? Oh.

541
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:46,851
She is so manipulative

542
00:26:46,934 --> 00:26:49,150
And materialistic and self-serving

543
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,034
And naked and... brooke-ish ?

544
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:54,150
What did you say ?
Nothing.

545
00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:57,739
Funny, i could have sworn
that i heard you speak.

546
00:26:57,938 --> 00:26:59,634
I meant she just seems

547
00:26:59,717 --> 00:27:01,734
A little bit like you were
in high school.

548
00:27:06,734 --> 00:27:08,967
He always wanted high-school brooke.

549
00:27:10,401 --> 00:27:12,267
Can i put my pants back on now ?

550
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,834
I'll take that as a yes.

551
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:36,184
You blame yourself
for nathan's troubles.

552
00:27:36,267 --> 00:27:38,950
I wasn't a great influence...

553
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:41,117
The girls, the parties.

554
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,584
Do you think he did it ?

555
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:44,720
No.

556
00:27:45,134 --> 00:27:49,467
Then stop blaming yourself
and fix it.

557
00:27:57,267 --> 00:28:00,384
Stay the night.

558
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:03,151
I miss this.

559
00:28:03,234 --> 00:28:04,933
Is that what you want ?

560
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,300
<i>That's what i need.</i>

561
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:23,984
Nathan scott is tree hill local

562
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:25,817
Who overcame injury and adversity

563
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,151
To achieve a dream he had
since childhood...

564
00:28:28,234 --> 00:28:30,318
A dream to play
professional basketball.

565
00:28:30,401 --> 00:28:32,917
But lately nathan's career
has taken a backseat

566
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,817
To allegations of an affair

567
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,300
That led to the pregnancy of a fan.

568
00:28:40,634 --> 00:28:42,984
In my opinion, continuing
to report on these allegations

569
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:45,084
Without any further evidence
of their validity

570
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:48,084
Is a reckless attempt
on the part of this network

571
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:49,551
To boost ratings.

572
00:28:49,634 --> 00:28:53,451
Now, i'm not saying
athletes are above the law.

573
00:28:53,534 --> 00:28:55,685
I'm saying it's up to science

574
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:57,834
To determine
the validity of these claims,

575
00:28:57,933 --> 00:28:59,117
Not the evening news.

576
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,751
To date, there has been
no new evidence

577
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:06,484
To suggest that nathan scott
is guilty of these allegations,

578
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:09,267
And yet he looks guiltier
the more that we report on him.

579
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,151
Sorry.

580
00:29:19,234 --> 00:29:21,184
I think i left my camera
in your bathroom.

581
00:29:21,267 --> 00:29:22,984
For my part, i got into sports news

582
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:24,850
Because i think
reporting on athletes

583
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:28,284
Inspires people to be exceptional.

584
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:31,384
And while i've never been
an exceptional athlete,

585
00:29:31,467 --> 00:29:35,151
I can strive to be exceptional
in my own way...

586
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:37,584
By refusing to bow to pressure,

587
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:40,318
By refusing to stoop to a level
that's beneath me,

588
00:29:40,401 --> 00:29:44,084
Just like nathan scott
has refused to.

589
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:45,601
Found it !

590
00:29:57,401 --> 00:29:59,034
Marvin : i believe in nathan scott.

591
00:30:04,534 --> 00:30:06,100
But i also believe in my viewers.

592
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,484
I believe you don't want any part

593
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:16,734
In dragging him through the mud.

594
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,917
So if you want sports news
and not gossip,

595
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,451
Turn the channel.

596
00:30:22,534 --> 00:30:26,084
Let my boss know that news
isn't just about ratings.

597
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:29,284
It's about people and integrity,

598
00:30:29,367 --> 00:30:32,117
But mostly it's about truth,

599
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,867
And that still means something.

600
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,884
I am marvin mcfadden,
and this is sports.

601
00:30:39,967 --> 00:30:43,833
Or at least... it used to be.

602
00:30:53,867 --> 00:30:56,384
Her retraction at this point
won't change anyone's opinion.

603
00:30:56,467 --> 00:30:58,318
It might.

604
00:30:58,401 --> 00:31:00,618
They'll all just assume
we paid her off,

605
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:02,284
And we will have,

606
00:31:02,367 --> 00:31:05,917
Which will just make us look
even more guilty.

607
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,685
But you know this, haley, which...

608
00:31:08,768 --> 00:31:11,685
Makes me think the only reason
you have left to pay her off

609
00:31:11,768 --> 00:31:12,853
Is that you're starting to believe

610
00:31:12,936 --> 00:31:14,334
She might be telling the truth.

611
00:31:15,401 --> 00:31:19,951
Haley, if i'm guilty of this...

612
00:31:20,034 --> 00:31:23,318
Not only am i the kind of guy
that would cheat on you,

613
00:31:23,401 --> 00:31:26,017
I'm the kind of guy
that would father a child

614
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,218
And then turn his back.

615
00:31:28,301 --> 00:31:30,184
I'm dan scott.

616
00:31:30,267 --> 00:31:32,184
If you think i'm capable of that,

617
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:33,685
You do what you have to do,

618
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:36,717
But i guarantee you,
if you've lost faith in me,

619
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,867
All the money in the world
isn't gonna fix it.

620
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,185
Yeah ?

621
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:09,934
You all right ?

622
00:32:12,137 --> 00:32:13,201
No.

623
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,951
But it's okay.

624
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:17,951
If i was,
i'd be a pretty lousy person.

625
00:32:18,034 --> 00:32:19,918
I'm sorry about earlier.

626
00:32:20,001 --> 00:32:21,384
It's just been...

627
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:22,567
I know.

628
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,451
I'm sorry that woman's
lying about you.

629
00:32:28,534 --> 00:32:32,551
I know you'd never hurt haley
like that.

630
00:32:32,634 --> 00:32:35,185
And you're not a coward.

631
00:32:35,268 --> 00:32:38,584
If anyone's a coward, it's me.

632
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:42,951
I'm not running away
from my problems, nathan.

633
00:32:43,034 --> 00:32:45,984
I'm walking away from
something that's broken.

634
00:32:46,067 --> 00:32:49,217
And that doesn't mean
that i'm not scared.

635
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,185
I just don't know how to let him go.

636
00:32:52,268 --> 00:32:55,634
I guess you do it
a little bit at a time.

637
00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:03,350
You're welcome to stay here
under our roof

638
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:05,201
For as long as it takes, though.

639
00:33:06,934 --> 00:33:08,433
Thank you.

640
00:33:28,268 --> 00:33:32,951
A candlelit pool-table-top
picnic dinner.

641
00:33:33,034 --> 00:33:34,751
What's the occasion ?

642
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:37,584
I figured my man was gonna be hungry

643
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:41,651
After spending the day modeling
for his ex-girlfriend.

644
00:33:41,734 --> 00:33:44,617
She get all your measurements ?

645
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,018
All but one.

646
00:33:47,101 --> 00:33:48,951
Oh, yeah ?
What'd she miss ?

647
00:33:49,034 --> 00:33:50,867
How much i love my girlfriend.

648
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,417
She forgot the most important
measurement of all ?

649
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,784
She didn't forget.

650
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,451
She just didn't have
a tape measure big enough.

651
00:33:58,534 --> 00:34:01,967
Always with the best answers.

652
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,934
Always with the best lips.

653
00:34:20,034 --> 00:34:22,500
If you ask it who's the fairest
of them all, i'm out.

654
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:27,751
Whoa, hey.
That was a joke.

655
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:30,350
Millie, i'm not mad anymore, okay ?

656
00:34:30,433 --> 00:34:33,250
Last night was my fault.
I shouldn't have been so...

657
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:35,651
i think i made a mistake, marvin.

658
00:34:35,734 --> 00:34:37,684
I don't know if i want this.

659
00:34:37,767 --> 00:34:39,984
Then why'd you say yes ?

660
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:43,651
Because it made me feel special.

661
00:34:43,734 --> 00:34:47,784
I mean, i felt competent
at my old job.

662
00:34:47,867 --> 00:34:52,246
I felt smart and capable
and reliable,

663
00:34:53,252 --> 00:34:55,718
But i never felt special.

664
00:34:56,134 --> 00:34:57,322
I think...

665
00:34:58,644 --> 00:35:01,284
You're the most special girl
i've ever met.

666
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:04,551
Thank you, marvin.

667
00:35:04,634 --> 00:35:07,085
But that night, it was like

668
00:35:07,168 --> 00:35:11,584
The whole world
believed i was special.

669
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:13,317
But who am i kidding ?

670
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,101
I'm not a model.
I'm just millicent.

671
00:35:19,101 --> 00:35:20,134
Come here.

672
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:31,734
What are you doing ?

673
00:35:36,154 --> 00:35:37,188
Funny...

674
00:35:37,901 --> 00:35:39,784
You are definitely the same girl

675
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:42,584
Who rocked the fashion
industry's world the other night,

676
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:43,818
And she was a model.

677
00:35:43,901 --> 00:35:46,451
Have you been through
any drastic changes

678
00:35:46,534 --> 00:35:47,984
In the last 48 hours ?

679
00:35:48,193 --> 00:35:49,222
No.

680
00:35:51,142 --> 00:35:52,300
Then, uh...

681
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:56,918
Unless i'm mistaken,
you're still a model.

682
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:59,350
And if modeling
makes you feel special,

683
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:00,884
Then you should do it,

684
00:36:00,967 --> 00:36:03,151
'cause you deserve to feel that way.

685
00:36:03,234 --> 00:36:07,400
You deserve to feel special
every second of every day.

686
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:20,085
All right, i'll explain this
in a minute.

687
00:36:20,168 --> 00:36:22,567
Take your time.
I am happy to watch.

688
00:36:24,811 --> 00:36:25,884
You work.

689
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:27,684
I am happy to watch you work.

690
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:30,989
It's very interesting d work-ish.

691
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:34,665
I'm gonna get that.

692
00:36:40,253 --> 00:36:41,282
Brooke.

693
00:36:41,715 --> 00:36:42,718
Come in.

694
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,784
Thanks.
This'll just take a second.

695
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:46,043
You're fired.

696
00:36:46,126 --> 00:36:48,185
I have a contract.
I'll pay you out.

697
00:36:48,268 --> 00:36:49,517
It's worth the loss.

698
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,284
This is so unnecessary.

699
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:53,851
Julian and i have
a working relationship.

700
00:36:53,934 --> 00:36:55,818
That means no "doing it."

701
00:36:55,901 --> 00:36:57,185
Maybe.

702
00:36:57,268 --> 00:36:59,317
But it's recently been brought
to my attention

703
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,018
That the way you behave is a lot
like high-school me used to,

704
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:03,484
And i would be insane

705
00:37:03,567 --> 00:37:06,051
To let high-school me
anywhere near the man i love.

706
00:37:06,134 --> 00:37:07,151
The man i love,

707
00:37:07,234 --> 00:37:08,551
Who shouldn't even think

708
00:37:08,634 --> 00:37:10,584
About sleeping anywhere
but the couch tonight.

709
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:12,784
<i>I'm sorry.
What did i do ?</i>

710
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:16,984
What you didn't do is tell me
that ho bag got naked for you.

711
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:18,118
Oh, that.

712
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:19,284
Yeah, that.

713
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:20,684
You... couch.

714
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:23,350
You... fired.

715
00:37:23,433 --> 00:37:26,034
Ciao, bitches.

716
00:37:27,867 --> 00:37:30,300
You can sleep here if you want.

717
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:55,484
Thanks for meeting me.

718
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:56,600
Have a seat.

719
00:37:58,967 --> 00:38:00,250
I know it must be hard to believe

720
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:01,984
That dan's gonna put you on the air

721
00:38:02,067 --> 00:38:03,317
And let you speak freely

722
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,851
About how awful
his son has been to you.

723
00:38:05,934 --> 00:38:08,234
You could say that.

724
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,151
There's something
i think you should know.

725
00:38:13,234 --> 00:38:16,451
When dan heard about you,
he reached out to nathan,

726
00:38:16,534 --> 00:38:19,617
And nathan shut him down,
just like he always does.

727
00:38:19,983 --> 00:38:21,085
So ?

728
00:38:21,168 --> 00:38:24,357
So dan isn't doing this
to help nathan see the light.

729
00:38:25,632 --> 00:38:27,846
He's doing this to bury nathan.

730
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:32,051
And the deeper nathan is buried,

731
00:38:32,134 --> 00:38:36,234
The more money he'll have to
pay you to dig himself out.

732
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:40,968
So...
will you do the show ?

733
00:38:49,683 --> 00:38:50,689
Okay.

734
00:38:51,534 --> 00:38:52,537
I'm in.

735
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:05,843
I didn't do it.

736
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:09,105
I couldn't.

737
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:21,584
That's what sets you apart from her.

738
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:25,484
It's one of a thousand reasons
why i could never,

739
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:28,017
Under any circumstances,
cheat on you.

740
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:36,151
I don't want to see you
lose your... your dream.

741
00:39:36,234 --> 00:39:37,400
Lose her ?

742
00:39:39,779 --> 00:39:41,378
She's right here.

743
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:45,600
And i'm never letting go of her.
