Ravens win!Mommy, ravens win!

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,250
Haley...

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,630
that's weird.I thought mommy would have beat us home by now.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,580
Haley: Nathan, hi.I'm so sorry.

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,960
You got jamie, right?

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,650
Yeah.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,010
Um, what happened?Where are you?

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,820
I just got locked in the library with lindsey and peyton.

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,390
I missed the whole game.

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,910
I'll fill you in on all the gory details as soon as I get home.

12
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,070
I'm on my way, okay?

13
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,470
All right, well, I'm just about to put jamie to bed, 

14
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,510
and then I'm gonna take a quick shower.

15
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,780
Oh, and, haley, I love you.

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,360
I love you, too.

17
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,790
Bye.

18
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,110
Do I really have to go to bed, daddy?

19
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,480
Pj's, brush teeth, bed.

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,410
Five minutes.Come on.Chop-chop.

21
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,820
Do I have to wear pj's?

22
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,010
Can't I sleep in this?

23
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,760
Okay.

24
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,950
But just for tonight, all right?

25
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:00,960
Now, come on.Let's go.

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,310
Awesome!

27
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,580
missed you tonight.

28
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,330
Carrie: Oh, I missed you, too.

29
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,640
Carrie, carrie!What are you doing?

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,670
This is not okay!You have to get out of here!

31
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,530
It's okay, nathan.

32
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,650
I love you, too.

33
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,540
What are you talking about?You think I love you?

34
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,960
Carrie, you have to get out of here.

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,570
Here, take this.Go.

36
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,830
Get out of the shower.

37
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,290
Carrie, get out of this bedroom right now!

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,060
haley, this -- oh, my god.

39
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,670
This -- this isn't this, okay?

40
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:57,740
I swear to you, I didn't -- look, I haven't -- carrie, tell her!

41
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,020
Nathan loves me, and I love him back.

42
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,860
I want you to get the hell out of my house right now!

43
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,720
Haley, look, I know this looks like --

44
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,230
you get out, too!

45
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:11,150
-Look, I didn't --
-get out!

oh, I'm sorry.I must be in the wrong office.

49
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,260
No, wait, that's me -- peyton sawyer, label president.

50
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,010
Touch?

51
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,640
What are you doing here, john?

52
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,080
The big corporate label finally fire you?

53
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,750
I happened to catch this new artist's live performance that *****

54
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,800
perhaps you know her -- mia catalano.

55
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,780
She's my artist, john.

56
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,670
It's a pretty big office for such a small label, don't you think?

57
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,180
Well, I've got a good act, and that's one more than you've got at your great big label.

58
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,120
It's good to see you, sawyer.

59
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,680
By the way, what are you feeling about the first single...

60
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,780
"only fooling myself"?

61
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,580
John, stay away from mia.

62
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,720
Let me ask you something, peyton.

63
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,280
If a great song is recorded but nobody gets a chance to hear it, 

64
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,030
does it really exist?

65
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,810
Hey, peyton, check it out.

66
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,020
Haley made the finished version sound so muchbetter than the demo.

67
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,390
-Mia.
-And you wereso right.

68
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,860
"Only fooling myself"is definitely the single.

69
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,460
Mia, I need to ask youa question, okay?

70
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,430
Were you approached by a r recordexecutive named john knight?

71
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,970
You mean that creepy, old guy who said heedus to be your boss?

72
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,250
No wonder you left L.A.

73
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,220
No, no, no.This is serious.

74
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,330
What did he say?

75
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,120
Nothing.

76
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,360
He saidhe saw my myspace video and that he wanted to hearthe whole record.

77
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,540
Is that all he said?

78
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,270
Mia, come on.

79
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,240
What else did he say?

80
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,480
He said I made a big mistakein signing with you and you don't havethe experience to launch me.

81
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,050
Hey, handsome.

82
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,290
Peyton in her office?

83
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,240
She was.

84
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,190
Just took off.

85
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,610
Looked likeshe was on a mission.

86
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,270
She wasn't armed, was she?

87
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,870
I don't think so, but didn'tget a chance to pat her down.

88
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,390
Easy, tiger.

89
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,020
Is it too earlyfor a brooke davis on the rocks?

90
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,300
Suit yourself.I just pour 'em.

91
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,750
You know something?I think I missed my calling.

92
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,900
Really?How's that?

93
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,600
Should have gone intothe clothing-design business.

94
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,100
I mean, if you can runa multimillion-dollar company from a barstoolwhile sipping A.M.

95
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,230
Cocktails, how hard can it be?

96
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,320
Plenty hard.You have no idea.

97
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,990
That's your story.

98
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,930
Don't write checksyou can't cash, buddy.

99
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,820
I'd be happy to whisk youup to new york anytime and show you how impressive andcomplicated it all really is, 

100
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:02,120
bartender boy, but if I did, who would tend to the bar?

101
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,190
Flights leave on the hour, dso iare ya.

102
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,640
All right.

103
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,890
You're on, brooke davis.

104
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,590
Okay.

105
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,440

*********

108
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,340
So, you've heard?

109
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,730
Haley kicked me out.

110
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,930
I need a place to stay.

111
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,730
What is that?

112
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,550
It's dan.

113
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,870
He's up for parole.

114
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,240
There's supposed to bea smiley face.

115
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,100
What?

116
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,210
Where's nanny carrie?

117
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,490
She knows how I like them.

118
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:24,510
Nanny carrie is not homeright now, and it's probably gonna bea little while before she comes back.

119
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,210
How long?

120
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,810
I'm not sure yet, sweetheart.

121
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,670
Who's going to take meto school?

122
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,970
I am.

123
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,970
In fact, I got everything ready.

124
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,080
I made your lunch, and I packed your backpack.

125
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,130
Yummy.

126
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,490
You cut my pb&j sideways.

127
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,810
Carrie cuts it in half.

128
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,770
I like it cut in half.

129
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,290
Well, it tastes the sameboth ways, I promise.

130
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:56,150
S sideways, and she's always tryingto kiss me.

131
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,350
Nathan: Yuck.

132
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,170
Daddy!

133
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,590
Jamie, can you go upstairsfor a few minutes, sweetheart?

134
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,680
Why?

135
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,740
Hey, why don't you go upstairsand fire up the playstation.

136
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,140
Mommy's gonna let you play for 10 minutesbefore you go to school.

137
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,940
Sweet!

138
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,720
Look, I have to goto dan's parole hearing, but before I do, 

139
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,780
I need you to hear me out.

140
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,510
Dan's up for parole?

141
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,580
Yeah, he pled guiltyto second-degree murder, he served good time, 

142
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,790
and it's been about five years, so, yeah.

143
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,260
But that'snot why I'm here.

144
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,020
All right.I'm listening.

145
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,910
There is absolutely nothinggoing on between me and carrie.

146
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,100
Didn't look like nothing.

147
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,770
Haley, she's gotsome kind of weird crush, and she thinks the feeling'smutual, but it's not.

148
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,560
There was some flirting, and I let it go, and I shouldn't have, 

149
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,540
but I swear to youthat's all there was.

150
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,870
What else, nathan?

151
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,260
Nothing.

152
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,690
I just...

153
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,100
I mean, I guess I-I knewthat she was getting attached.

154
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,650
I was gonna saysomething to you, okay?

155
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,900
I was.

156
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,290
But I just need youto know there is nothing going onbetween us.

157
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,660
Damn it, nathan.

158
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,880
I really thought we were, like, rounding thiscorner of everything, you know?

159
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:19,070
I-I don't --I don't know how to -- I just -- I need some timeto think and just be alone.

160
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,660
Haley, please, just --

161
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,080
Can you just -- can you just goto dan's hearing, 

162
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,490
and then we can find a timeto deal with this later?

163
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,320
Please?

164
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,210
Nathan.

165
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,540
There better not be more.

166
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,470
I will be damned if I let you aeal myrtist, john.

167
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,450
It's not stealingif she wants it to happen.

168
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,910
Did she say that?

169
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,040
What did you tell her, a bunch of liesto make her feel that way?

170
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,560
Like you did with that little actress out inL.A.?

171
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,900
How'd that go?

172
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,460
Oh, admittedly, that could have gone better.

173
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:23,710
'Cause, see, I heard you convinced herto quit her hit tv show in order to tourfor this record, 

174
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,330
but I guess your ghostwriterand your cool producer didn't really work out, did they?

175
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:32,610
Because now, thanks to you, she doesn't have a music career or a tv show.

176
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,750
Johnny, you forget -- I workedfor you for two years, okay?

177
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,160
I watched you churn and burnall your artists in yourcorporate greed machine, 

178
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,220
and I will notlet that happen to mia.

179
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,960
She deservesway better than that.

180
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,580
Are you finished?

181
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,410
That's a nice speech, peyton.

182
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,820
The only question is, can you back it up?

183
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,370
You got a lot of great albumson that wall, but the sad truth is, 

184
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,680
you wouldn't have heardof half of them without the supportof a major label.

185
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,940
I should know.

186
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,080
I signed four of them.

187
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,510
You know what?Mia's gonna make it.

188
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,820
We'll be just fine.

189
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,980
Are you sure?

190
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,620
Just look at that wallagain.

191
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:20,330
All those artistshave two things in common -- great songsand a major label.

192
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,770
I'll be honest --I'd love to sign mia.

193
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:27,370
I want to get her musicout there into the world because it is great.

194
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,110
She deservesto be heard.

195
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,990
And you do not havethe resources to do that yet.

196
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,360
You're not even close.

197
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,770
You're justgonna kill her.

198
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,950
I'm in towntill tomorrow morning.

199
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,430
Do the right thing, sawyer.

200
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,730
Mitchell.

201
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,890
Sub in for Q.

202
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,290
Man, why you pulling me, coach?

203
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,690
Come on.

204
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,250
Let me see your hand.

205
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,890
All right, we'll get a doctorto take a look at that.

206
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,420
Grab some pine.

207
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,720
Jamie!

208
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,250
Jamie!

209
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,680
Why are you sad, nanny carrie?

210
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,470
Well, I'm sad because...

211
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,610
I have to go away.

212
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,830
But I don't want you to go away.

213
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,340
Why do you have to leave?

214
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,030
I really don't wantto leave you.

215
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,120
It's just...

216
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,000
your mommydoesn't like nanny carrie.

217
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,850
She wants me to leave.

218
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,450
But I want you to stay.

219
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,480
So do I.

220
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,640
But your mom's the boss, and what she says goes.

221
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,140
I wishyou were my little boy.

222
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,550
I always will.

223
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,260
bye, jamie.

224
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:49,100
okay, you have 4, 000 square feeton central park west.

225
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,730
What's this place?

226
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,030
Well...

227
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,090
this placeis a good investment.

228
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,970
And it doublesas a crash pad when I want to partyin the east village.

229
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,840
Woman on tv: Maybe they're right.

230
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,610
Somebody's here.

231
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,700
Maybe it is in your blood.

232
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,200
Man on tv: That's right.

233
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,570
It's in my blood.

234
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,330
And I'm still looking for the man who put it there.

235
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,880
Oh, my god.Rachel.

236
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,140
Brooke, get a shower running.Make it cold.I'm gonna need some towels.

237
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,860
Rachel.Rachel, can you hear me?

238
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,920
Brooke, shower -- now!

239
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,800
Come on, come on, come on.

240
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,450
Rachel, come on.

241
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,690
Come on, baby!

242
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,660
Come on, baby!

243
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,980
Baby, come on!Wake up!

244
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,250

Come on, come on.Wake up.

246
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,320
Open your eyes.

247
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,480
Open your eyes, honey.

248
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,220
Come on.

249
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,140
Wake up!

250
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,770
Wake up!Come on!

251
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,700
Come on, wake up!

252
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,350
Please don't let her die.

253
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,240
Come on, baby.

254
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,510
Baby, wake up.Rachel!

255
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,170
Rachel, open your eyes!

256
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,970
Open your eyes!

257
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,020
Wake up!

258
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,910
Please, wake up!

259
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,410
Please tell meshe's gonna be okay.

260
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:30,460
If by "okay, " you meanshe's not gonna die, then yes.

261
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,220
But no, she's not okay.

262
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,770
Do I need to take herto the emergency room?

263
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,480
No, her color's back, she's breathing, she's out ofany immediate danger.

264
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,760
But...just let me keep an eyeon her a little bit longer.

265
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,490
We'll see.

266
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,110
Okay.

267
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,760
How do you know her?

268
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,710
She's a friend from home.

269
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,050
I hired herto model for the company.

270
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,320
I haven't seen herin a while.

271
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,250
I knew she had problems, but not like this.

272
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:07,930
She started screwing upphoto shoots, and victoria insistedI let her go.

273
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,230
I need to help her.Atwh do I do?

274
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,740
Start bygetting rid of this.

275
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,270
Don't put itin the trash.

276
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,440
Why?

277
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,110
When she wakes up, that'sthe first place she'll look.

278
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,710
Okay.

279
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,690
Well, I'm afraidit's not good.

280
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:38,240
You have a hairline fractureof your right carpal radius.

281
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,770
What's that mean?

282
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:43,730
Well, it means you needa cast on that wrist for the nextfour to six weeks.

283
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,600
Man, I can't do that.I'm gonnamiss too many games, man.

284
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,300
I'm -- you're --you know what?

285
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,240
This is my last season, okay, to impress the scouts if I want to play college ball, all right?

286
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,030
Help me out, man.

287
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,840
You need the cast, son.

288
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,740
You don't have a choice.

289
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,050
I'm sorry.

290
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,770
Hey, baby.

291
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,320
How wasyour day at school?

292
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,480
What's wrong, james?

293
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,550
Why did nanny carriehave to go away?

294
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,260
little man, you know, with grownups, sometimes they just needto move on with their own lives, 

295
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,870
and nanny carrie decided that it was timeto move on with her life.

296
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,570
That's not what she said.

297
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,470
She said you sent her away'cause you hated her.

298
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,650
She didn't want to go.

299
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,440
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

300
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,490
When did she tell you this?

301
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,380
Today, at school.

302
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,080
Peyton: The manis a complete snake.

303
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,530
I've seen him do ita thousand times.

304
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:56,270
He offers you the moonand throws you out there, and the second you fall short, he drops you just like that.

305
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,780
Look, I don't care about him.

306
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,570
I love this record, and I'm sure we'll be okay.

307
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,470
No, we will.You're right.

308
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,040
We will be okay.We'll be better than okay.

309
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,750
And you know why?Because I've got a plan.

310
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,160
We're gonna roll out yourfirst single on college radio.

311
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,060
We get you out thereon tour, then we'll doguerrilla marketing, 

312
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,950
like fliers and wild postingsin all the mass markets.

313
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,540
Ooh, and I've got a lot ofstreet-team contacts out in L.A.

314
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,080
That I know would loveto work with you.

315
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,200
That sounds great.

316
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,920
No.

317
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,500
No, it doesn't, mia.

318
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,360
God, he's offering you, like, a five-course mealup in first class, 

319
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,440
and I'm offering youa sandwich in coach.

320
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,180
No, peyton, don't feelthat way.

321
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:30,880
I don'T.

322
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,790
But it's true, honey, okay?

323
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,720
You made a much better recordthan I thought you could, 

324
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,720
and you deservethe spot on the big tour and the kind of airplayand big promotion that I just --

325
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,740
I can't give it to you.

326
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,570
No.It doesn't matter.

327
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,200
You're the one who got me here, and I want to stay with you.

328
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,520
You really mean that?

329
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,650
Absolutely.

330
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,180
Okay.

331
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,080
I need to get my stuff.

332
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,290
It's in the garage.

333
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,510
Boxes are marked "whore.

334
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,490
" I'll have the keys now.

335
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,860
I'm sorry, haley.

336
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,560
I never meantfor it to turn out this way.

337
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,910
Did you goby jamie's school today?

338
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,570
Jamie looks at me as family.

339
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,760
I was just saying goodbye.

340
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,700
No, you are not family.

341
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,860
I invited you into this home, and I trusted you with the two most importantthings in my life --

342
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,720
my husband and my son --and you betrayed that trust.

343
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,470
I know you're upset.

344
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:33,400
Just knowthat i never meant for nathanto fall in love with me.

345
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,620
Oh, honey.

346
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,690
He's not in love with you.

347
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,090
I can promise you that.

348
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,690
Did he tell youhe kissed me?

349
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,560
He didn't tell you, did he?

350
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,100
God, that is so nathan.

351
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,000
Well, he did kiss me.

352
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,480
And he watched me swim naked, and he liked it.

353
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,060
You see, he wanted me in that shower.

354
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,400
I'm sorry that it's hard for you to face, but it's the truth.

355
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,650
I have told you once, and I am not gonnatell you again --

356
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,060
stay the hell awayfrom my family!

357
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,040
I hate you!

358
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,750
Jamie!

359
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,770
Am I dead?

360
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:27,140
You O.D.'D.

361
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,880
You're alive, but you're really stupid.

362
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,780
Rachel, what happened to you?

363
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,160
I don't know.

364
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,580
Life happened, I guess.

365
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
But...

366
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,740
drugs?

367
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,930
They just made mefeel better.

368
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,850
Then they just made me feel.

369
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,620
Why didn't you come to me?

370
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,720
Why didn't you let me help you?

371
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,960
We were friends, brooke.

372
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,110
You fired me.

373
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,340
Who is it?

374
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,340
Brooke, lock the door.Don't come out till I say.

375
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,170
Hey, man.Come on in.

376
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,280
Who are you?

377
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,660
It's cool.Rachel saidyou were gonna be stopping by.

378
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,540
Come on in, man.Come on.

379
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,860
We're allin the waiting room, here.

380
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,780
So, uh...

381
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,060
where's rachel?

382
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,100
She's, uh, she's right here.

383
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,560
Let me go, man!

384
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,820
I didn't do nothing to you!

385
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,810
My friend is falling out on your junk backthere!

386
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,960
So where is it?

387
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,840
I don't knowwhat you're talking about.

388
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,500
You ever come in here again, I will break your neck!

389
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,860
Do you hear me?

390
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,880
That bitch owes mea lot of money, man!

391
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,130
Yeah?

392
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,400
Consider thatpayment in full.

393
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,420
Get the hellout of here.

394
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,070
Owen, who was that?

395
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,700
Nobody that's coming back.

396
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,120
So, how'd it gowith haley?

397
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,050
She's gonna needmore time.

398
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,030
Well, give it to her.You owe her that.

399
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,000
I just wish he would havehelped us more, you know?

400
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,170
It would have been really niceto have a father today --

401
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,630
someone I could actuallyturn to for advice.

402
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,040
Yeah.

403
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,570
You know, for the past four years, I pretendedthat dan didn't exist.

404
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,590
Then I get this letter, and it hits me --

405
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:21,060
that one day, we may have to facehaving him in our lives again.

406
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,490
Let's not let thatbe today.

407
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,160
Hello, son.

408
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,280
knight:Hel-lo, peyton.

409
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,810
I was pretty sureI'd be hearing from you.

410
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:12,680
Well, I thought aboutwhat you said, and I think you're rightabout mia.

411
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,880
So the assistantto the assistant finally learnsthe business.

412
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,400
Congratulations, peyton, it's about time.

413
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,690
About time for what?

414
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,520
Mia.

415
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,320
it really isin your best interest.

416
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,200
That's notwhat you said earlier today.

417
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,910
You said he was an evil snakethat couldn't be trusted.

418
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,550
So which is it, peyton?

419
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,850
Knight: In spiteof what she said earlier, 

420
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,140
I think you shouldlisten to her now, mia.

421
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,650
She's making a lot of sense.

422
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,420
Oh, really?She's making sense now?

423
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,700
Listen, you can dowhatever deal you want with her, 

424
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,050
just know that I willnever play for you -- never.

425
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,110
I am an artist, not a business transaction.

426
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:53,710
You know, peyton, I really thoughtwe had something special.

427
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,310
Thanksfor selling me out.

428
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,300
No, mia!

429
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,080
Mia, wait!

430
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,390
Good afternoon.

431
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,020
When I was 17 years old, I fell in love.

432
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,470
Her name was karen.

433
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,490
And for a long time, she loved me back.

434
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,990
We had a son -- lucas.

435
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,520
But we never becamethe family we should have been.

436
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,160
Instead, my brother, keith, assumed that role.

437
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,220
And in my heart, something died.

438
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,890
I deserve to be in here.

439
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,300
There's no excusefor the crime that I committed.

440
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:46,790
And believe me when I tell youI spend every moment wishing I could takethat fateful day back.

441
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:51,150
Keith scott is deadbecause of me.

442
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,000
And that's somethingI have to live with for the rest of my life.

443
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,790
So I'll just makeone pledge here today.

444
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,790
If at some time you decideto grant me my freedom, 

445
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:07,250
know that I'll spendevery living moment trying to mend the lives of the peoplethat I hurt by my actions.

446
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,190
Because I've lostmore than my freedom.

447
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,590
I've lost somethingfar more important than that.

448
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,100
My family.

449
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,880
These young men stand atthe dawn of their adult lives.

450
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,920
So far, because ofwhat I put them through, 

451
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,390
they've had it pretty rough.

452
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,620
They deserve better.

453
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,760
They deserve a father.

454
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,130
I hope somedayyou'll give them that.

455
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,020
Man:Thank you, mr.Scott.

456
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:49,040
Does anyone elsewish to speak at this time?

457
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,360
Yes.

458
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,500
Um, I'm lucas scott.

459
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,520
I'm his SON

460
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,130
please, go ahead.

461
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,590
My father abandoned my motherwhen she was pregnant with me.

462
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,550
He left usto struggle on our own, even thoughhe was a man of means.

463
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,870
Growing up, I only hadone person to look after me -- keith scott.

464
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,700
And this man killed him --

465
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:25,610
his own brother -- in cold bloodat point-blank range.

466
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,490
Next week, I'm getting married.

467
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,760
Keith...

468
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,830
would have been my best man.

469
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:38,030
But he's not gonna be there, just like he didn't seemy state championship

470
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,930
or see my first novelpublished.

471
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,870
Dan took all that.

472
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,870
And he did itwith malice and premeditation.

473
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:52,420
Dan is an educated man, and if he is nothing...

474
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,690
he's very persuasive.

475
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,820
Do not let him fool you.

476
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,960
He has a very darkand ugly heart.

477
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,980
And he should neverbe allowed to walk the streetsa free man.

478
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,570
So as you deliberate his fate, I ask you only one question.

479
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:20,940
How can a fatherhope to influence his sons when they never even cameto see him?

480
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,150
Never even once.

481
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,100
Thank you.

482
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,690
Um, actually...

483
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:36,660
it looks herethat, uh, nathan...

484
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,220
you've been to visit your father recently.

485
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,100
Is that true?

486
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,930
Yes.

487
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,750
what the hell?

488
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,620
You went to go see dan, and you didn't tell me.

489
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,520
Why?

490
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,270
'Causeause I was donewith him, and I wanted to tell himto his face.

491
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,360
I didn't think it mattered.

492
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,870
Well, it did matter.

493
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:14,370
Just like getting up there and telling themwho he really is mattered.

494
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,680
Don't you get it?

495
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,130
Get what?

496
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:21,030
If they thinkyou still need dan in your life, they might let him out.

497
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,940
You know, it's not meI'm worried about.

498
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,920
Or you.

499
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,040
It's jamie.

500
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,390
Dan's gonna try to get to him.

501
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,540
You know that.

502
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:35,520
The only wayto keep your family safe is if dan stays locked up.

503
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,370
Can I ask yousomething?

504
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,510
How'd you know who the guy wasand what to do with rachel?

505
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,280
Let's just sayI've been there.

506
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,560
You meanyou had a problem?

507
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,070
No.

508
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:02,710
I'm sayingI'm an addict -- a junkie, brooke.

509
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:08,180
You ever wonder why you never see metake a drink behind the bar?

510
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,470
Been sober eight years.

511
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,470
How'd you make it back?

512
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,770
I had a friend.

513
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,880
He helped me.

514
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,560
I'd be dead right now if itwasn't for him, no question.

515
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,370
He never gave up on me.

516
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,830
See, brooke, I can understand the whole "cutting off rachel"on the business side, 

517
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,980
but I'm struggling withthe whole "friendship" side.

518
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,010
You don't know my mother.

519
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:36,260
Victoria is relentlesswhen she wants something, 

520
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,170
and it's easier to just do itthan to fight her.

521
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,650
You ever wonderwhere you'd be if at some critical moment, when you needed it the most, 

522
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:46,240
your friendsjust weren't there for you?

523
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,840
can she ever be okayagain?

524
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,690
I don't know.Maybe.

525
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:57,830
You know, what rachel needsright now...

526
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,880
is to go to rehab.

527
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,280
This is the placethat helped me.

528
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,180
Their facility here --it's the best in the city.

529
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,690
And I can take her therefor you, if you need me to.

530
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,540
I need to do it.

531
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,540
I have to step up for her.

532
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,880
She needs me.

533
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,300
In that case...

534
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,170
I'm gonna go.

535
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,270
Do not give up on her, brooke.

536
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,890
You are better than that.

537
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,060
Some first date, huh?

538
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,580
Is that what this was?

539
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,730
You know, I have to say, your lifeis really impressive --

540
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:53,010
the real estate, the business, the money.

541
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,090
That's just notwhat really interests me.

542
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,040
what's under all the clothes, brooke davis?

543
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,050
nathan: Didn't expectto find you here.

544
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:30,800
Oh, you know -- ain't nothinglike an empty gym when you want to be alonewith your thoughts, man.

545
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,640
What you doing here?

546
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,550
The same.

547
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,580
What's on your mind?

548
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,930
Oh, man, just, uh, planning my big moveon your scoring title.

549
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,040
Man, that --that last season you had, boy, that --

550
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,950
that must havebeen something special.

551
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,100
Truth be told, I, uh, took itfor granted a little bit.

552
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:02,060
I mean, breaking all those records and the scoutscoming to see me play, 

553
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,810
the state championship...

554
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,720
I wish I could go back.

555
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,430
I'd appreciate it more.

556
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,220
I just want it so bad, man.

557
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,680
You know?

558
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:18,680
Is that okay to say?

559
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,040
-'Cause I --
-sure.

560
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,900
And you'll get there.

561
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:29,190
And when you do, just be sure to enjoy it, 'cause it only comes once.

562
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,060
In the blink of an eye, it can all be gone.

563
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,830
You got to trust me, rachel.

564
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:56,280
This is the bestrehab facility in the city, and I'm gonna take careof everything.

565
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,380
I don't carewhat it costs.

566
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,840
Please, brooke, please.

567
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,700
I don't want to be aloneagain, all right?

568
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,230
I don't want to goto some strange place.

569
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,680
I'll be good.I promise I'll stop.

570
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,470
Honey, we both knowthat's not realistic.

571
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:11,600
You have a problem, and you need to go.

572
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,370
Brooke...

573
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,420
y-you're my only friend.

574
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,620
If you -- if you leave methis time, I won't make it.

575
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,040
Please don't give upon me.

576
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,120
Look, can't I just stay herewith you?

577
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,800
Look, man, I'm -- I'm sorry about what happened todaywith dan.

578
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,440
I let you down.I could have done better.

579
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,560
I just -- he got to me.

580
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,210
You know?

581
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:56,000
And I know you're alwayslooking out for jamie, it's just --you got to understand, 

582
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,750
I would never letanything happen to him.

583
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,800
Then go be his dad.

584
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,300
Work things out with your wife.

585
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,180
It's really bad, man.

586
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:11,660
A-and remember, it might bebetter to save your marriage than to be righton this one, okay?

587
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,740
I mean, besides, since haley's gonna belindsey's maid of honor, 

588
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:19,060
I'm really gonna need my best man to begetting along with her.

589
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,850
Thanks, man.

590
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,730
I, uh, I know that wassupposed to be keith.

591
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,050
I'm -- I'm honored.

592
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,800
I miss you.

593
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,230
Haley: Hey, jim-jam.

594
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,990
Time for bed, buddy.Here we go.

595
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:56,890
Want me to, uh, read you a story?

596
00:34:56,890 --> 00:35:00,340
How about, "go, dog, go!You like that one, right?

597
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,790
Where's daddy?

598
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,370
Mommy and daddy are just having a little...

599
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,790
bit ofa tough time right now.

600
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,230
He's stayingwith uncle lucas.

601
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:13,950
Is daddy gonna be sad again, like last time?

602
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,440
I don't think so.

603
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,370
I hope not.

604
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,810
Daddy stopped being sad when nanny carriecame to live with us.

605
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,130
He liked nanny carrie.

606
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:27,220
I know this isprobably really hard for you to understand'cause you're...

607
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,620
so little.

608
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:34,370
Nanny carriewasn't a very nice lady, and she neededto go away.

609
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:40,470
I wish nanny carriewas my mama.

610
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,430
So?

611
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,000
Don't freak out, okay?

612
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,150
But what if I told you that "only fng myself" is gonna be your first single?

613
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,860
Your record will be distributednationally in six weeks.

614
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:12,240
You will stayon red bedroom records, which john willnow distribute worldwide.

615
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,300
You have final say on touring, image rights, and album art, 

616
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:20,460
anu get to keepyour publishing, which means you ownall your own songs.

617
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,870
And?

618
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:24,410
And we get to stay togetheras a team.

619
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,240
You did it!

620
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,190
No, you did itwith that performance!

621
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,340
That was incredible!

622
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,000
Dude, did you see his facewhen you freaked out on him?

623
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,250
It was awesome!

624
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:35,060
He was practically tripping over himselfto give us this deal.

625
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,910
You know, it wasn'tthat hard a performance.

626
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,890
I meant every word.

627
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:43,280
Except the partwhen I called you a sellout -- not that part.

628
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,630
Well, I thinkyou've got to go home and pack your bags now, 

629
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,150
'cause you're opening upin houston tomorrow.

630
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,900
What?

631
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,860
Yeah, and for someonewho I think that you know.

632
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,960
Um, have you heardof ryan adams?

633
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,090
Oh, my god!That's amazing!

634
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,590
What?

635
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,490
What's wrong?

636
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,540
Oh, I-it's just...

637
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,170
it all happened so fast.

638
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,700
I'm not sureI'm y to say goodbye.

639
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,050
No, you're ready.

640
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,750
And it's not "goodbye.

641
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,660
" This is just the beginningof your dream come true.

642
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,570
And I want you to know, I am really, realloudto b oa partf it.

643
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,000
Now go out thereand be great.

644
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:47,510
I can't be alone again.

645
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,560
You're not gonna be.You're coming home with me.

646
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:58,310
Come here.

647
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,360
I love you, keith.

648
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,250
I just hope I can behalf as good an uncle to jamie as you were to me.

649
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:15,070
I miss you.

650
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:23,560
Aftercareful considerations, we have cometo a decision.

651
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,780
Mr.Scott...

652
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,400
haley, I'm sorry, okay?

653
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,660
And I'm sorryfor the way this looks, but before you say anything, 

654
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,420
just know that it's my fault.

655
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,700
I should have done somethingearlier.

656
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,470
I should have -- I should have said somethingto you from the start.

657
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,980
She said that you kissed her.

658
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,640
Did you?

659
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,910
Jamie:Daddy's home!

660
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,320
Buddy, what's up?

661
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,060
mommy and ineed to talk right now, okay?

662
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,400
So why don't you go out backand shoot around?

663
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,080
You know what?Try to makefive free throws in a row.

664
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,620
And I'll be out therein a sec, okay?

665
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:23,000
it's a simple question, nathan.

666
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,860
Did you kiss her?

667
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,900
No.

668
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,610
But...

669
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,980
she kissed me.

670
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:39,880
You looked me in the eye and you said thatthere's nothing else.

671
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,350
And I have been througha lot with you, nathan.

672
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,280
I've been through better and worse, in sickness and health, 

673
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,940
but I will not do infidelity.

674
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,060
It wasn't like that, okay?

675
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,490
I wasn't into her.

676
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:49,960
You call kissing carrie and watching her swimnaked not being into her?

677
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,100
I didn't kiss her!

678
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,870
How many times do ihave to tell you that?

679
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:53,810
It wasn't me.

680
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:54,850
It was carrie.

681
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,450
No, it's you!It's always you!When are you gonna learn?

682
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:01,020
When are you gonna stopmaking bad choices that threaten everythingthat we've built?

683
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,900
Everything I've ever donewas for this family, haley!

684
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,450
Well, excuse us for beingsuch a weight around your neck.

685
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,570
I didn't say that, okay?

686
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,580
And you know I didn't mean that.

687
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,080
Don't put wordsin my mouth.

688
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:14,080
Well, somebody needs to, becauseyou have a really nasty habit of neglecting to mentionimportant details.

689
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,120
Haley, you know what?

690
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,610
I'm really trying hard to behonest about all this right now, 

691
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:20,550
but sometimes for you, it's just never enough, okay?

692
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,310
And I can't take itanymore!

693
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,430
nd it's my fault because I putso much pressure on you, and the best part is, 

694
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,650
you screw the nanny, and jamie ends uphating me!

695
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,570
I did not screw her!

696
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,900
where is he?

697
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,340
Jamie!

698
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,160
Jamie.

699
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,850
Jamie!

700
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,180
Oh, god!

701
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,690
