1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,470
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,460
- I'm not on the chifs anymore. - What?

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,560
I'm the point guard for the Charlotte Bobcats.

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,880
You're in the NBA?

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,450
I'm in the NBA.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,020
You told me that someday I'd be ready to let someone in.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,750
I think today might be someday.

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,380
I love you.

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,250
I used to wonder why I was still alive.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,920
I'm not. And this is my hell.

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,650
Pull the trigger.

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,650
Take the pain away!

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,350
Maybe you're still here for redemption.

14
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,180
I sat there in the dark-- alone, broken.

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,120
On the eve of my son's first game in the NBA,

16
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,980
I sat alone on a playground basketball court

17
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,380
And waited for death.

18
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,020
I'd been given only days to live.

19
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,920
That was 14 months ago.

20
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,520
Bill, I want you to listen to me

21
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,180
Because we have a history of helping each other

22
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,570
And because I'm the best damn

23
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,020
sports agent that you deal with.

24
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,480
Now, listen --

25
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,480
You guys turned it around last season in a very big way.

26
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,720
But Pennington needs receivers, and you know it.

27
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,020
Hackett's big. He's fast.

28
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,420
And you throw that ball anywhere near him,

29
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,580
He gets up and gets it.

30
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,880
Mm-hmm. That's absolutely true.

31
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,380
But he's also going into his third season,

32
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,240
And, historically, You know that that's when NFL

33
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,810
wide receivers flip the swith.

34
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,380
Santana Moss, Steve Smith

35
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,520
Hackett is gonna be right there with them.

36
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,480
Bill, this one is so easy.

37
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,280
You have the money. You need the player.

38
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,020
All you need to do-- pull the trigger.

39
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,820
You know what? I got to cut you off.

40
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,250
I got New England on line two.

41
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,620
You're doing the right thing.

42
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,480
You're getting a great player at a great price.

43
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,980
Yeah, I'll have my office send the paperwork over.

44
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,150
Thanks, Bill.

45
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,680
And, hey, congratulations.

46
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,480
Hey, Mom. I got to call you back.

47
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,620
You could come with me.

48
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,720
I can't.

49
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,480
You say that every time.

50
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,620
And you say "I can't" every time.

51
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Because I can't.

52
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,980
But the movie's almost over,

53
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,250
And then you can come back to Tree Hill,

54
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,120
And we can finally be together, right?

55
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,640
Yes, of course.

56
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,560
This space reserved for Haley James Scott.

57
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,480
Good morning. Clothes Over Bros. Please hold.

58
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,050
Good morning. Clothes Over Bros. Please hold.

59
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,470
I need you to go online and find me some pictures, recent ones.

60
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,550
And call their reps and get me head shots.

61
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,650
Also, call Prime and cancel the dinner reservation

62
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,820
I had for tomorrow night.

63
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,180
This is good, but I want to see it in green.

64
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,820
Green is the new orange.

65
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,180
I heading back to tree hill, so book me a flight,

66
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,620
Preferably direct,

67
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,150
And call me in the car and tell me which terminal.

68
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,280
Is that my coffee?

69
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,050
Mocha double latte, no foam.

70
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,620
Last time there was foam. I hate foam. Is there foam?

71
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,720
No foam.

72
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,180
Um, Victoria wanted to see you about...

73
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,450
About the model she wants to hire

74
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,020
To be the new face of Clothes Over Bros.

75
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,280
We're not going with a model. We're going with an actress.

76
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,420
Cancel the meeting.

77
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,180
She's not gonna like that.

78
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,620
Yeah, well, she works for me.

79
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,350
Don't tell her I said that.

80
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,020
Okay, now go. Chop, chop.

81
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,820
Calliope.

82
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,220
You're a good assistant, but have some fun, okay?

83
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,350
You're only young once.

84
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,250
The season's over, Nate.

85
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,220
For some guys.

86
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,620
For me...

87
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,150
It's just the preseason for next year.

88
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,520
See, that is why I love being your agent.

89
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,520
Most guys are away on vacation, but not Nathan Scott.

90
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,150
He's in the gym doing work.

91
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,350
And I'm not the only one who's noticed.

92
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,950
What do they say?

93
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,320
All the right things, man...

94
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,380
That they love you, you had another great season,

95
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,480
And you're a very important part of the future.

96
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,420
Does any of this mean I have a new contract?

97
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
Not yet.

98
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,820
But what did I tell you, man?

99
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,520
14 months ago when you came up on that 10-day?

100
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,750
"Just do the work."

101
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,820
"Just do the work." And you have.

102
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,050
You worked hard. You played great.

103
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,050
And now it's gonna cost them.

104
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,050
You love this stuff, don't you?

105
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,280
Hell yeah, I do.

106
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,650
And I'm good at it, man. So don't sweat it.

107
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,050
I'd never do anything

108
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,120
To jeopardize you or Haley or Jamie.

109
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,080
I know.

110
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,760
Speaking of, the little man's got

111
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,120
a birthday coming up, right?

112
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,950
Any idea what he wants for a gift?

113
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,380
Well, you spoiled him with all the autographed jerseys.

114
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,620
You're just moving through your client roster now.

115
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,520
I think he's, uh... he's up to Jerry Rice.

116
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,550
It's a good life, Nate.

117
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,120
Did you ever think a couple knuckleheads like us

118
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,380
Would end up here?

119
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,520
I thought I would.

120
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,980
You, not so much.

121
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,220
Hey, can I ask you a question

122
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,480
About your meeting with my bosses?

123
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,020
Yeah.

124
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,380
Couldn't you have at least worn a suit?

125
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,580
I mean, the jeans, man? Really?

126
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,020
Yeah, I probably cost you

127
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,120
At least a million dollars right there.

128
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,520
It was a very bad choice.

129
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,520
Thanks.

130
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,650
Man, it's crazy.

131
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,820
Nobody buying used CDs no more.

132
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,780
Half the record stores done closed down.

133
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,980
And this collection was strong, too.

134
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,720
Look -- tribe called quest, de la soul, and biggie.

135
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,750
What?

136
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,420
Maybe try Goodwill?

137
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,080
Man, killy, goodwill is not getting my tupac CDs.

138
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,550
Ah, they wouldn't take them either, huh?

139
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,280
Nope.

140
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,620
So, listen, I was thinking,

141
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,550
While you're cleaning out some clutter,

142
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,680
You might want to move some other stuff, too.

143
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,080
- Oh, word? Like what? - Like all of it?

144
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,980
All of it?

145
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,850
You want me to move out?

146
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,320
Well, I don't want you to.

147
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,320
I just... don't you want your own space With Lauren?

148
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,520
Do I want my own space...Yes.

149
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,120
But can I afford it right now

150
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,580
When I'm trying to start a new business...No.

151
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,420
I can't believe you kicking me out.

152
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,350
I'm not kicking you out. You're on the lease, too.

153
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,080
- I just  - You want me to go.

154
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,920
I want you to stay.

155
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,250
Yeah, I know.

156
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,680
You look sad, Brooke Davis.

157
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,050
I'm not sad.

158
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,580
Yes, you are.

159
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,700
You've been moping around ever

160
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,750
since that nigh at the beach.

161
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,320
I'm just gonna miss you, that's all.

162
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,720
But you don't have to.

163
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,520
What's keeping you in tree hill now that Peyton's gone?

164
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,820
You went back for her.

165
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,780
So did you.

166
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,480
That's not fair.

167
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,950
Look, all I'm saying is,

168
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,280
If you can run Clothes Over Bros from Tree Hill,

169
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,720
You can run it from anywhere.

170
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,880
But tree hill's home.

171
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,750
We'll be okay.

172
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,350
All right, here we go.

173
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,420
Julian. This is a great night.

174
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,250
I'm proud of you.

175
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,780
Good morning, little man.

176
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,050
What are you all dressed and waiting for?

177
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,250
It's my birthday.

178
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,050
Ah, I hate to break it to you, Kiddo,

179
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,610
But your birthday was yesterday.

180
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,880
You slept right through it.

181
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,450
Whatever, mom.

182
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,580
Mom?

183
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,780
Happy birthday!

184
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,480
- I can't believe you're 4 already!  - 7.

185
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,480
- Oh, would you settle for 5?  - No.

186
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,110
Maybe we could feed you coffee and cigarettes

187
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,080
And keep you really small.

188
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,450
Mnh-mnh! I'm 7.

189
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,710
I've been waiting a long time for this, you know?

190
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,010
I know.

191
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,480
And i really am sorry we had to cancel your party.

192
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,510
You're really not that funny.

193
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,050
Hey, I can make you laugh though.

194
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,210
What's the matter? What?

195
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,750
You too old to be tickled, Mr. 7?

196
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,380
Help! Where's dad when I need him?

197
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,010
He can't help you now! He's at work!

198
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,350
Mmm. You always smell so good.

199
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,950
It's my rainstorm body spray.

200
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,780
It's gonna be a stormy night.

201
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,210
Come here.

202
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,210
Cut.

203
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,410
Let's check it.

204
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,810
What?

205
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,810
You are terrible at this. You're just so wooden.

206
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,010
Hey, I told you I didn't want to do this, all right?

207
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,310
I'm just playing, man. You look great.

208
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,050
No, I don't. I look wooden.

209
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,310
I'm a wooden tool that uses body spray.

210
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,050
Come on, Nate. This is a great gig.

211
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,780
A guy works all day, he has a date

212
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,980
He wants to smell nice,

213
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,080
So he reaches for some rainstorm body spray.

214
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,320
And why?

215
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,780
Because that's what Nathan Scott does.

216
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,110
You know what else Nathan Scott does?

217
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,810
He takes a shower. He actually washes himself.

218
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,910
Body spray?

219
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,110
You might want to keep it down

220
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,750
Seeing as how they're paying you six figures

221
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,450
And it is your only source of income right now.

222
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,910
Oh, and whose fault is that?

223
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,480
Oh, that's right. My agent's you.

224
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,780
I don't know why you choose to hurt me like this.

225
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,810
The contract negotiations, the endorsements,

226
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,480
The never-ending love and support.

227
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,850
Oh, okay.

228
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,650
All right, now i really do need some body spray

229
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,680
To cover all that crap.

230
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,850
It all comes full circle.

231
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,080
Pictures up!

232
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,910
Look, you sell the products. I'll sell you.

233
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,450
But go and get this right so we can eat some cake already.

234
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,550
Otherwise, "It's a gonna be a stormy night."

235
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,550
Okay, all right.

236
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,080
You're so stormy.

237
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,950
Hey, man, what's up?

238
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,610
Okay. It ain't gonna work.

239
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,650
What?

240
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,750
You trying to get rid of me with your naked ass.

241
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

242
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,980
I'm just hanging out in my apartment.

243
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:36,980
It ain't gonna work. Ain't gonna work!

244
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,410
Can I come out yet?

245
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,710
Uh...okay!

246
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,910
It's gonna be the best birthday ever!

247
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,280
See? All this, and not one scary clown.

248
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,750
Hey, you want to see your cake?

249
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,580
Wait, this is not

250
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,080
"happy birthday, Jam?"

251
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,010
This cake is so good.

252
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,350
Aunt Quinn!

253
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,180
Kid I can't remember!

254
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,950
Dude, you're like, what, 32 now?

255
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,310
- 7.  - 7, right. of course.

256
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,680
I was talking to your mom.

257
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,610
Ha ha. What are you doing here?

258
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,480
I had an assignment in new york, and I thought,

259
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,880
I don't know, I haven't seen my dorkiest sist

260
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,280
What? Taylor wasn't home?

261
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,580
You're so funny.

262
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,950
Get your sexy butt over here.

263
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,080
Aunt Quinn, you ate my cake before I made a wish.

264
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,810
See, I don't think this is your real cake.

265
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,710
If you look really, really close, if it was,

266
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,950
I wouldn't be able to do this!

267
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,880
You're so dead.

268
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,510
You're crazy.

269
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,310
Run!

270
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,050
Oh, you're so dead!

271
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,510
Hey, can I borrow a pen?

272
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,780
I got to sign Jamie's card.

273
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,850
I don't know why you got to take this so personally.

274
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,680
I don't know what you're talking about, dawg.

275
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,750
I'm just airing things out.

276
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:28,980
No, you're not.

277
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,550
You're mad because i want you to move out.

278
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,350
But it's only because i'm trying to step things up with milli

279
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,610
It's not like i don't still consider you a great friend.

280
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,880
It's not like i don't want to hang with you.

281
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,010
You're my friend.

282
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,710
I love you.

283
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,710
I love you, too.

284
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,750
Okay.

285
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,310
Good to know the stereotype's not true.

286
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,450
So, I want you to know I totally took one for the team,

287
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:17,850
And I made you some closet space in the spare bedroom.

288
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,380
So, they called me about that film in New Zealand.

289
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,110
They want me to produce it.

290
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,550
It's a big movie, Brooke. It could make my career.

291
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,710
When does it start?

292
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,280
Right after this one.

293
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,580
So, basically, now.

294
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,810
- For how long?  - Eight months.

295
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,510
I don't have to take it.

296
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,810
No. You should.

297
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,350
You have to.

298
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:10,880
Time's gonna fly by, I promise.

299
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,980
Then we'll be together, okay?

300
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,300
Thanks.

301
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,460
Oh, you know what? Let me get that for you, Hales.

302
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,620
Thanks, Clay.

303
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,790
And by the way, you look gorgeous.

304
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,220
Easy now. Have I mentioned he only makes 10%?

305
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,120
Yeah, but I wasn't the one making out with a lingerie m

306
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,160
We weren't making... there was no making out.

307
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,090
- Hey, dad.  - Hey, buddy! ahh.

308
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,990
So, are you having a good time, 7?

309
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,360
Yeah.

310
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,720
Aunt Quinn is here, and she surprised me with fake cake.

311
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,790
You know, the last girl I took home surprised me with

312
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,460
Hey! Who wants to open presents?

313
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,490
Check it out.

314
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,820
Hey, he thinks you're hot.

315
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:21,890
I am hot.

316
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,460
- Hi, Nate.  - Hey, Quinn.

317
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,360
Clay, my sister-in-law Quinn.

318
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,960
Quinn, my agent, Clay.

319
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,820
Look, the Bobcats got no depth in the backcourt,

320
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,160
So step up and get this guy paid, Jerry Maguire.

321
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,360
I like her.

322
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,990
Hey, it's me again.

323
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,420
I just thought you might want to wish Jamie happy birthday

324
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,420
So call me when you get this

325
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,960
Or any of the other three messages.

326
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,960
Okay, bye.

327
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,090
Okay, we're gonna open presents.

328
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,420
Are you all right?

329
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,890
Julian's starting that new movie in New Zealand,

330
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,790
And you know how it is.

331
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,460
Tell me about it. Nathan's gone most of the year.

332
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,660
Yeah.

333
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,120
Well, at least the BNA has an off-season.

334
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,020
Apparently, hollywood doesn't.

335
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,860
How's your new record coming?

336
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,120
So-so.

337
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,920
The parent label is sending somebody out

338
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,490
To run some of the day-to-day stuff

339
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,120
So I can get a little bit more done.

340
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,890
They said something about freeing me up.

341
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,590
Well, that's good, right?

342
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,220
Come on, mom! Chop, chop!

343
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,260
Chop, chop?

344
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,820
He gets that from me.

345
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:23,860
Presents!

346
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,190
The bussiness, too.

347
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,190
All right, Jame. Which one's first?

348
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,820
Uncle Lucas.

349
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,990
Oh, read the card!

350
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,360
"Jamie, Peyton and I miss you every day.

351
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,460
"This present was my best friend until I met your mom.

352
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,720
I got it from my uncle Keith when I turned 7,

353
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,190
And now I want you to have it.

354
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,920
It got me through all kinds of stuff,

355
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,290
And I hope it helps you, too.

356
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,660
I love you -- uncle Lucas."

357
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,790
Cool! It's uncle Lucas' basketball.

358
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,960
Check it out, dad!

359
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,790
"Skills."

360
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,890
Ha, that's what I'm talkin' about, baby.

361
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,860
Awesome! cds!

362
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,290
Old-school hip-hop. Tupac, Biggie, run-dmc, a'ight!

363
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,790
Wait, I'm sorry --

364
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,790
You just gave a 7-year-old your tired, old, used cds?

365
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,520
Look, baby, I had to. Goodwill wouldn't even take it.

366
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,420
Oh, my god

367
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,820
Dad.

368
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,990
Don't worry, Jamie. I actually bought you something.

369
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,090
Awesome! A Jerry Rice jersey.

370
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,060
Oh, man, that is exactly what I was gonna get you

371
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,960
An autographed Jerry Rice jersey.

372
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,260
It's not autographed.

373
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,690
Huh. I see. One second.

374
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,320
Jerry. Hey, it's Clay.

375
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,590
Listen, I'm at Jamie Scott's 7th birthday party, and

376
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,460
He thought you were 6.

377
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,260
7.

378
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,460
He claims he's 7. Yeah, he's a little short.

379
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,990
Hey, anyways, I was wondering

380
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,020
If you could maybe sign his Jersey sometime.

381
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,460
All right, cool.

382
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,960
Yeah, thanks, man. I appreciate it.

383
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,620
- All right, not a problem. - Sweet.

384
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,460
Especially since he's in the house.

385
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,990
Where is the birthday boy?

386
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,790
Hey, where's jamie?

387
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,860
Would you look at that? It's Jerry Rice.

388
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,620
How are you guys doing?

389
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,920
What's up, Jamie?

390
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,890
Oh, damn, my gift sucks.

391
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,900
Happy birthday.

392
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,560
All right. Let me sign it for you.

393
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,770
Hi, Nate.

394
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,360
Do you mind if I get a picture?

395
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,090
Yeah, sure, no problem.

396
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,860
You had a great season last year.

397
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,260
Did you re-sign yet?

398
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,420
No, not yet. Hopefully soon though.

399
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,620
I hope so.

400
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,490
Well, it was good to see you again.

401
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,060
You don't remember me, do you?

402
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,290
Hey, dad.

403
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,290
Check it out. Jerry Rice signed my jersey.

404
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,620
Oh, look at that! It's great, buddy.

405
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,720
Hey, little man.

406
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,120
You want your present or what?

407
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,460
We have a tradition

408
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,790
I know. It's my favorite.

409
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,260
That's what I wanted to hear.

410
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,560
All right, you get this much for being my godson.

411
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:35,490
And an extra zero for being my very favorite guy.

412
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,660
Whoa. Thanks, aunt Brooke.

413
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,060
You're welcome. I love you, buddy.

414
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,990
What did you wish for?

415
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,560
Well, if I tell, it won't come true.

416
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,190
But maybe I can wish something for you.

417
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,620
Mom says I get one wish for me,

418
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,420
And I can wish stuff for other people, too.

419
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,790
Dude, hook me up.

420
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,460
Okay, here it goes.

421
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,920
Wow, you're good.

422
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,440
What are you doing here?

423
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,440
It's Jamie's birthday.

424
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,510
What about the movie?

425
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,640
Well, I moved some things around.

426
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,080
Look, mom. Aunt Quinn got me luggage.

427
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,010
That's good. I got it, buddy.

428
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,010
So, how long do we get you?

429
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,510
I don't know. A few days.

430
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:43,940
That sounds wonderful. Come on.

431
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,340
I don't know about this problem.

432
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,680
I'm still working on it.

433
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,240
Anyway, one of the great things about this house

434
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:52,040
Is that there's all these spare bedrooms nobody ever uses.

435
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,810
Really?

436
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,040
Would you guys get a room?

437
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,180
And not one of ours, please.

438
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,610
Welcome back, Julian.

439
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,510
I'm sorry! We're going!

440
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,610
So, I think I'm gonna take off pretty soon.

441
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,640
I got to knock out some work,

442
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,040
And the body spray girl's coming by.

443
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,980
The girl from the shoot today.

444
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,210
She has a name, you know? It's Kylie.

445
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,810
Of course it is.

446
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,310
Get him!

447
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,680
Touchdown!

448
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,240
Someday when he's older,

449
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,680
And he thinks back on his best days as a kid,

450
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,110
He'll think of this day,

451
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:44,040
The day he was happy and safe and loved.

452
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,980
That's a hell of a gift, Nate.

453
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,110
All right. You fellas need anything?

454
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,240
Just you.

455
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,280
Oh, well. All righty.

456
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,540
Your sister's hot, Hales.

457
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,140
Yeah, so is her husband, Clay.

458
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,940
She's always been amazing,

459
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,640
Talented, artistic... wonderful marriage.

460
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,080
Okay, guys.

461
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,280
We got the greatest receiver in the history of the game right here.

462
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,480
We're going deep to Jamie.

463
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,840
Oh, man.

464
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,340
Lauren, you run a slant. Andre, stay short.

465
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,810
So, what do I do?

466
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,840
Jerry Rice, you block.

467
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,580
Ready? Break!

468
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,110
207 touchdowns and they got me blocking? Damn it.

469
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,480
Hut!

470
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,540
Jamie!

471
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,180
She throws a mean spiral.

472
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,910
My sister Quinn.

473
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,740
The beach is becoming our spot.

474
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,380
I don't think you can call it a spot

475
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,010
If it's every other month.

476
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,380
I guess that's fair.

477
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,280
No, i'm sorry.

478
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,740
Do you remember how it was in the beginning?

479
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,280
Even if we were apart, we'd talk every night.

480
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,140
And my heart raced with every text.

481
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:13,240
And every time my phone rang, I hoped it would be you.

482
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,680
I still do that with you.

483
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,510
Yeah?

484
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,340
Peyton used to say, "People always leave."

485
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:37,410
Who knew she was actually talking about her stupid ass?

486
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,110
I'm just lonely.

487
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,880
We're here now.

488
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,510
I know.

489
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,380
And it's amazing.

490
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,140
And it's what I wished for.

491
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,940
Want to know what I wished for?

492
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,880
Skinny-dipping.

493
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,780
You did not!

494
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,610
Uh-huh, I did. You coming or what?

495
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,680
That's what she said.

496
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,980
You know, I think our son had a great time today.

497
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,370
He has his mom to thank for that.

498
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,670
I have his dad to thank for a great life.

499
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,880
You know the last days when you were on the road,

500
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,840
This is all I dreamed of nights like these?

501
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,540
I think it's what I've always dreamed of.

502
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,910
It's more than I dreamed.

503
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,610
Who's creeping all up in my hood?

504
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,880
What?

505
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,840
Skills gave me his cd collection.

506
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,740
Oh, lord.

507
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:06,270
Did you have a good birthday, Jamie?

508
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,340
The best. I'm glad you guys are my parents.

509
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,070
Well, we're glad we didn't leave you

510
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,340
On the steps of that orphanage...some days.

511
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,310
- Very funny.  - Hey, got your new ball, huh?

512
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,120
You know, your birthday's not over yet.

513
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,250
What do you say we go down to the river court,

514
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,420
See if this thing's got any good shots left in it?

515
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,380
Cool, I'll get ready.

516
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,820
Want to come?

517
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,820
No, I think it'll be good for him

518
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,660
To have some time with his dad.

519
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,420
I'll just hang out with Quinn.

520
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,490
You know, I'm glad Quinn's here.

521
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,420
You guys will have fun together.

522
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,920
Yeah, me too.

523
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,620
I'll see you.

524
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,200
Summer night, bottle of wine...

525
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,670
I know.

526
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,860
If I was Taylor, it would totally be on.

527
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,980
Oh, you brat.

528
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,610
Well, well, my rock star little sister

529
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,730
Hanging out at her lavish pool with her pro-bas husband.

530
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:00,050
Speaking of husbands, how is David?

531
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,110
Where is David?

532
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,860
David's working on a documentary to save the world.

533
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,670
Wow. That sounds like David.

534
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,020
You miss him?

535
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,230
Yeah, I do.

536
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,480
You know, sometimes I think about the way we grew up...

537
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:19,370
That house and the noise... the family.

538
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,110
I miss it, you know?

539
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,110
Why, Haley Bob?

540
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,560
I mean, you have it all right here.

541
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,020
All right, big man. let's see what you got.

542
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,920
You know, this old ball's probably a little rusty.

543
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,290
Why don't you try again?

544
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,920
There we go!

545
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,820
That's what I'm talkin' about. Good as new.

546
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,020
Was uncle Lucas a good player?

547
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,020
Yes, he was very good.

548
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,660
How come he stopped playing?

549
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,420
Well, he, uh, he had a problem with his heart.

550
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,160
Like grandpa Dan?

551
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,120
Yeah, yeah, kind of like grandpa dan.

552
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,590
I miss him.

553
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,390
Uncle Lucas, I mean.

554
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,190
Yeah, I know you do, buddy.

555
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,160
I'll tell you what... instead of playing "Horse",

556
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,160
Why don't we play a game of "Lucas" tonight, huh?

557
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,590
All right, you go first.

558
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,960
Really? It's like that?

559
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,560
All right, so, if i miss this, I get an "L"?

560
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,620
Yes, you do.

561
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:32,160
If I make it, you give me 50 bucks.

562
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,160
Aw! Dang it.

563
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,960
You get an "L."

564
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,790
Hey, it's me. Let's roll some calls.

565
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,590
Try Mitch from the Lakers.

566
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:15,020
So, how is the movie going?

567
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:20,690
Well, we ran into a couple of issues with Work Visas and permits.

568
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,160
Meaning?

569
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:27,090
Meaning it's gonna be more like 10 months, not 8.

570
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,780
You're killing me.

571
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:36,850
I know, but I do have some good news.

572
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,880
I decided not to produce the movie.

573
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,820
What?

574
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,920
Yeah.

575
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,720
But why? That was an important movie.

576
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:52,020
No, it was a lucrative movie. It wasn't important.

577
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,050
And I want to make important movies.

578
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,650
And, besides, there's this girl

579
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,720
That I'm kind of in love with, and

580
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:05,280
I couldn't be away from her for another day.

581
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,150
If you look at the history of this position

582
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,350
And the last five contracts given to players under 25

583
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,220
With his numbers, you'll see

584
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:56,180
Well, I think you'll see that we're not being unreasonable.

585
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,820
Sorry.

586
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,450
Nice place.

587
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,850
I assume it has a bedroom.

588
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,720
Well, there's been a baseline set by the marketplace, so

589
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,050
I'll see you in there.

590
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,450
Bob, I got to call you back.

591
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:52,250
And there's wild animals that roam about everywhere.

592
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,550
And when little boys turn 7, just like you,

593
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,280
They have to go out into the wilderness

594
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:01,720
And live alone for a whole week.

595
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,120
I probably couldn't do that.

596
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,150
Okay, time for bed, buddy!

597
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,820
Okay.

598
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,280
Good night, Aunt Quinn.

599
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,850
Good night, monkey face!

600
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,650
Happy birthday, buddy. I'll be up in a minute.

601
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,860
I think he really missed you.

602
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,170
I know I did.

603
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,480
I missed you, too.

604
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,990
That's weird. It's the studio calling.

605
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,420
Why's that weird?

606
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,650
Because it's my studio, and i'm here.

607
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,320
Please don't be me calling.

608
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:43,000
Hello?

609
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,330
Interesting business hours.

610
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,000
I waited in the bar for half the day,

611
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,900
And finally the manager let me in.

612
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,030
I'm so sorry.

613
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,470
It is my son's birthday party today.

614
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,330
I'm Haley anyway.

615
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,770
It's nice to meet you.

616
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:05,200
Miranda Stone. John Knight sends his best.

617
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,070
We're all looking forward to hearing more of your music.

618
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,570
Thank you.

619
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,080
Yeah, I know the process has been a little slow.

620
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,380
It's been tough to focus on my record

621
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,080
While running the label and raising my son, and...

622
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,180
Yeah, we lost Peyton to one of those.

623
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,980
- Sorry?  - Kids, you know? Family.

624
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,570
Uh, well, you know, we are just so happy that you're here.

625
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,310
And I know the label's gonna run a lot smoother

626
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,180
With you at the helm.

627
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,040
Yeah, when we said we'd free you up, that's not what we meant.

628
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,920
I don't understand.

629
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,800
I'm not here to run the label.

630
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,480
I'm here to close it.

631
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,560
Quinn?

632
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,830
Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?

633
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,830
What? What's going on?

634
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:57,190
You know earlier when when I said I missed David?

635
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,190
I do.

636
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,960
And I have for a while now.

637
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,490
What happened, Quinn? You said he

638
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,090
I left him.

639
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,560
Why?

640
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:28,490
Because he's not the man I fell in love with.

641
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,860
And he hasn't been for a while now.

642
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,960
And I didn't agree to spend the rest of my life

643
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:37,560
Sleeping next to a complete stranger.

644
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,730
Dude, no way you're still up.

645
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,330
I don't want it to end.

646
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,770
Bed. Now.

647
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,480
Always keeping a brother down.

648
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,700
Hey, dad, was your 7th birthday as good as mine?

649
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,970
You want the truth?

650
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,070
Dad, I'm 7. I can handle it.

651
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,110
We had this big party planned just like yours.

652
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,420
But then grandpa Dan realized that there was

653
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,750
A pee-wee basketball tournament the same day.

654
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,690
So we canceled the party.

655
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,120
My team ended up losing the game,

656
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,150
And, uh, he didn't speak to me for the rest of my birthday.

657
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,420
Did you ever forgive him?

658
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,220
I wish I could say yes, son.

659
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:43,690
But I'm not sure I ever did.

660
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,550
Well, I think you should.

661
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,720
Well, you're a good man, jamie scott.

662
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,350
Good night, son.

663
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,190
Hey, dad?

664
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,050
I think you're good enough to forgive him.

665
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,020
You're Nathan Scott.

666
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,820
Forgiveness is never easy.

667
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:22,390
Bitterness is easy. Hatred is easy.

668
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:27,090
But forgiveness, that's a tough one.

669
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:30,050
Sometimes, people say things they don't mean

670
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,490
Or do things they can't take back.

671
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,220
Sometimes we do things we can't take back.

672
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:42,150
So we feed ourselves to starve the pain.

673
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:03,090
Get a list of all the free-agent

674
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,190
And restricted point guards in the league

675
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,790
And find out if the Bobcats are talking to any of them.

676
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,950
Call that kid from Arkansas.

677
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,490
Set up a meeting to discuss representation.

678
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,550
Saturday is the 14th.

679
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,720
Send flowers.

680
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,350
We're all afraid of something.

681
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,020
I'm scared.

682
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,250
What if we ruin it?

683
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,320
What are you talking about?

684
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:48,950
The feeling that I get when I see you after a month.

685
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,520
And the way my heart aches when I smell your skin.

686
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:55,090
I don't want it to go away.

687
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,350
It won't.

688
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,890
We won't let it.

689
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,620
I was afraid.

690
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,750
I was dying.

691
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:20,190
But in the face of great despair, I had an epiphany --

692
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,790
What I've done is who I am.

693
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:27,190
But what I've done is not who I'll be.

694
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,620
Come to bed.

695
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,420
I'll make it worth your while.

696
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:51,590
I can't. Uh... actually, I got to go.

697
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:54,050
You can sleep here... Or I'll see you later.

698
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,320
Wow, nothing like love at first sight.

699
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,120
I don't believe in love.

700
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:10,390
It's been nearly 37 million seconds...

701
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:15,250
10,000 hours, 14 months

702
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:20,950
Since I realized what I've done is not who I can be.

703
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,820
Unburden yourself from the mistakes of your past.

704
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:29,720
And when you do, your heart grows stronger.

705
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,420
I should know.

706
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,190
Mine was supposed to go out a long time ago.

707
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:50,120
It doesn't mean what you've done is forgotten.

708
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,190
4:30 in the morning, Clay.

709
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,020
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

710
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,620
What's going on?

711
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,620
Does that girl look familiar to you?

712
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:07,050
Yeah, she was at the party today. Why?

713
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,920
She says she slept with you on the road, Nate.

714
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,450
What you've done is out there.

715
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,650
And she's going public.

716
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:21,650
And what you done remembers.
