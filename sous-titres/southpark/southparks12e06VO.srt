South Park - Season 12 Episode 6
"Over Logging"

2
00:00:35,608 --> 00:00:37,939
Get off the Internet,
Stanley, it's time for bed.

3
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:39,895
Mom, I just gotta
do a couple more things.

4
00:00:40,015 --> 00:00:42,965
Now, Stanley. The Internet
will be waiting for you in the morning.

5
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,926
- Off!
- Aw man!

6
00:00:48,524 --> 00:00:50,665
Shelley, off the Internet. It's bedtime.

7
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:53,815
Mom, I'm i-chatting with
my boyfriend in Montana!

8
00:00:54,227 --> 00:00:55,650
Now, Shelley!

9
00:00:56,195 --> 00:00:57,761
Why do you hate me?

10
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,005
Randy, off the Internet.

11
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,402
No. No come on, leave me alone.

12
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:07,355
- No, mister, it's time for night-night.
- But Sharon, I've got stuff to do.

13
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:10,273
I've gotta see my credit rating,
I've gotta send an e-mail to Nelson and

14
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:12,235
check out Foley's vacation photos-

15
00:01:12,355 --> 00:01:14,056
You don't have to do all that now!

16
00:01:14,176 --> 00:01:17,126
You can do one more
thing and then it's bedtime.

17
00:01:18,223 --> 00:01:19,473
One more thing?

18
00:01:24,537 --> 00:01:26,098
Oooo yeah...

19
00:01:39,942 --> 00:01:41,142
What the hell?

20
00:01:41,446 --> 00:01:44,134
- Stan! Stan, I gotta use your computer!
- What?

21
00:01:44,254 --> 00:01:46,138
My Internet's not working;
I gotta use yours.

22
00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:48,234
And give Daddy some private time,
will ya?

23
00:01:48,354 --> 00:01:51,054
- My Internet's not working either.
- What?

24
00:01:51,844 --> 00:01:55,247
- Dad, the Internet's not working!
- I know that, okay?

25
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:59,155
I have to get online with
my darling Amir before school starts!

26
00:01:59,897 --> 00:02:02,075
Randy, I can't get my e-mail to open.

27
00:02:02,335 --> 00:02:05,673
Everybody just calm down!
Calm down, all right?

28
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:09,155
It's going to be okay!
We just can't panic!

29
00:02:11,386 --> 00:02:13,795
Gerald. Please help us.

30
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:15,605
Randy. What happened?

31
00:02:16,154 --> 00:02:18,850
Our house... It has no Internet.

32
00:02:19,394 --> 00:02:20,593
Oh my God.

33
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,475
We've got nothing!

34
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:24,056
It's just gone.

35
00:02:24,424 --> 00:02:28,192
Come in. You can use our Internet
until you figure out what to do.

36
00:02:28,312 --> 00:02:29,654
Thank you Gerald.

37
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,439
- I'm getting on it first.
- Oh no you're not!

38
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:34,875
Kyle, I need to use your Internet.

39
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:36,525
- It's not working.
- What?

40
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:38,986
I've even unplugged it
and plugged it back in.

41
00:02:39,106 --> 00:02:41,606
No. No, our Internet can't be broken.

42
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,474
Ah, I've gotta get an attachment
Larry sent me last night.

43
00:02:44,594 --> 00:02:45,852
It's not working, Gerald.

44
00:02:45,972 --> 00:02:47,579
But it has to work!
Maybe if I do a little-

45
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:49,998
Your Internet's not working,
Gerald! Face it!

46
00:02:50,258 --> 00:02:51,903
I have to get online before it's school.

47
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:53,834
What about Starbucks?
They have free Internet.

48
00:02:53,954 --> 00:02:55,055
Right, Starbucks!

49
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,925
Everyone get your stuff;
we can take my car.

50
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:02,941
- Hey, is your guys' Internet working?
- No! Nobody's is!

51
00:03:03,254 --> 00:03:05,054
What's happening?

52
00:03:05,464 --> 00:03:07,955
Jesus. Everyone's gonna
go to Starbucks now.

53
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:10,935
Everyone in the car.
We have to beat them there.

54
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,901
God, the whole neighborhood's affected.

55
00:03:19,176 --> 00:03:21,029
Get out of the way, Peterson!

56
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,853
Folks, there's no Internet here.

57
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,578
- It's not working, I tell ya.
- It's not working here?

58
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:31,043
Kids, get back in the car.
We can go to the Mac store.

59
00:03:31,163 --> 00:03:33,135
No, don't. You're wasting your time.

60
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,866
- How do you know?
- Because we just came from there!

61
00:03:35,986 --> 00:03:38,786
There was nothing!
Not one scrap of Internet!

62
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:42,550
How can there be no Internet anywhere?
What's going on?

63
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,928
Anybody got a Blackberry?
Check Drudge Report.

64
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:49,098
Good idea! No wait, we can't check
Drudge Report: there's no Internet!

65
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:51,434
There has to be a way
to find out what's going on.

66
00:03:51,694 --> 00:03:53,214
We can't! Don't you get it?

67
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:55,772
There's no Internet to
find out why there's no Internet!

68
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,566
What did we used to do to
get the news before the Internet?

69
00:04:00,705 --> 00:04:02,123
A television!

70
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,914
<i>Once again we apologize,
but we cannot bring you the news.</i>

71
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:19,307
<i>It appears that we have
no Internet here at News 4.</i>

72
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,809
<i>We'll be happy to bring
you up on current events</i>

73
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,426
<i>just as soon as our Internet is back.</i>

74
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:27,314
Jesus, it's statewide.

75
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,114
It could be nationwide.

76
00:04:29,607 --> 00:04:31,524
<i>Hello? Do you have Internet?</i>

77
00:04:32,863 --> 00:04:34,513
<i>It it's Channel 4 News.</i>

78
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,188
<i>No, we don't have Internet either.</i>

79
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:40,963
No Internet...

80
00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:42,275
anywhere...

81
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:44,424
Jesus...

82
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:46,498
we're all alone...

83
00:04:55,804 --> 00:04:58,632


84
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:02,219


85
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:11,372
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

86
00:05:11,492 --> 00:05:15,392
I need to get on Web MD and
see why I have this cough, but I can't.

87
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,840
What if my sweetheart
is online looking for me?

88
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,075
He could be wondering why
I don't get online with him.

89
00:05:22,195 --> 00:05:23,945
Maybe he thinks I'm dead.

90
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:28,114
If my darling Amir gets another
girlfriend, I'm gonna kill him!

91
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
And you!

92
00:05:31,718 --> 00:05:33,301
Shelley, whoa, stop, stop!

93
00:05:33,421 --> 00:05:35,924
Dad, you've gotta do something!
She's out of control!

94
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,994
You're right.
We just can't sit here any longer.

95
00:05:44,258 --> 00:05:47,558
- Randy, where will you go?
- We're gonna head west.

96
00:05:47,678 --> 00:05:51,012
There's a rumor going around
there might be some Internet out there.

97
00:05:51,132 --> 00:05:52,979
So we're headed out Californee Way.

98
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:55,058
You don't know if there's
any Internet in California.

99
00:05:55,318 --> 00:05:56,925
Well there certainly ain't none here!

100
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:59,500
Look, maybe it's time
you all face reality!

101
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,315
- The Internet here is dried up!
- It could come back.

102
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:04,325
Yeah, and maybe it won't!

103
00:06:04,859 --> 00:06:07,930
In the meantime I got a family
who needs the Internet right away.

104
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,350
We'll head out Californee Way and...

105
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,080
see what we can find.

106
00:06:12,876 --> 00:06:14,276
Come on, let's go.

107
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,901
Look, if you... you do find
Internet, let us know, will ya?

108
00:06:20,021 --> 00:06:22,278
How. You won't have Internet.

109
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:40,144


110
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:43,773


111
00:06:44,313 --> 00:06:45,775
Sorry folks, we're full up.

112
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:49,363
Know anywhere else we can stay?
We're... heading out Californee Way.

113
00:06:49,483 --> 00:06:52,196
- Looking for some Internet.
- You and everyone else.

114
00:06:52,316 --> 00:06:54,156
You'll have to stay out
at the transient camp

115
00:06:54,276 --> 00:06:55,866
with all the others
heading to Californee.

116
00:06:55,986 --> 00:06:58,246
It's about a mile down the road.

117
00:07:00,522 --> 00:07:03,292


118
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:09,445
I'm going down the road feeling bad.

119
00:07:09,565 --> 00:07:13,636
I'm going down the road feeling bad.

120
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:17,605
I'm going down the road feeling bad,

121
00:07:17,725 --> 00:07:19,116
oh Lordy.

122
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:23,179
My Internet done up and went away.

123
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:30,762
- Where are you from, old-timer?
- Kansas City.

124
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:35,079
Had me a store there.
Kind of... computer supply store.

125
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,619
When the Internet went,
the stores went too.

126
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,466
Things will be different
when we get out to Californee.

127
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,250
Soon as we get us some
Internet we can all rest easy.

128
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:46,763
Why sure, Silicon Valley.

129
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,408
They gots a whole mess
of Internet up there.

130
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:52,036
'Say a man can practically
roll around in it.

131
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:56,243
When I get to that Internet I'm gonna
click on just about everything in sight.

132
00:07:56,363 --> 00:07:59,369
Might even click on a pop-up
ad just for the heck of it.

133
00:07:59,489 --> 00:08:03,339
Well I'm gonna sit down at
that Internet and just start e-mailing.

134
00:08:03,587 --> 00:08:07,445
Just keep on e-mailing till
my fingers are sore to the bone.

135
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,820
Sure will be nice.

136
00:08:10,642 --> 00:08:12,904
You folks all heading to Silicon Valley?

137
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,281
That's right. We need to get online.

138
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:19,368
- "Get online" he says.
- What's so funny about that?

139
00:08:19,628 --> 00:08:23,145
Think about it. How many
folk heading out to Californee?

140
00:08:23,265 --> 00:08:25,131
A million? More?

141
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:28,044
And how much Internet
you think they got out there?

142
00:08:29,112 --> 00:08:31,089
Might be some Internet, sure,

143
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:33,360
but with everyone
trying to use it at once,

144
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,505
it's gonna go real slow-like.

145
00:08:35,702 --> 00:08:37,602
I knows it 'cause I seen it.

146
00:08:38,177 --> 00:08:41,077
My two children,
they tried to load a Web page.

147
00:08:41,642 --> 00:08:43,489
Took them over three days.

148
00:08:43,712 --> 00:08:45,362
They sat there waiting,

149
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:49,860
and by the time the loading
bar was only half-full they was dead.

150
00:08:50,445 --> 00:08:52,301
Starve on the Internet,

151
00:08:52,684 --> 00:08:55,537
with a belly stuck out like a bladder...

152
00:09:00,727 --> 00:09:02,495
Come on, Stan, let's get some rest.

153
00:09:08,171 --> 00:09:09,553
Amir...

154
00:09:10,723 --> 00:09:13,035
I miss you so much...

155
00:09:17,018 --> 00:09:18,468
Don't cry, Shelley.

156
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,050
You'll be able to get online
when we get to Californee.

157
00:09:33,957 --> 00:09:36,028
Everyone, wake up! We're here!

158
00:09:36,288 --> 00:09:39,361
Silicon Valley, Californee!

159
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,288


160
00:09:50,565 --> 00:09:53,114
- Name?
- Do they have Internet here?

161
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:55,296
- Name?
- Marsh.

162
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,518
- Service provider?
- NetZero.

163
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,814
All right, stay in line.

164
00:09:58,934 --> 00:10:02,193
Once you're inside, Red Cross volunteers
will direct you to your campsite.

165
00:10:02,313 --> 00:10:04,162
So is there Internet here?

166
00:10:04,282 --> 00:10:06,682
Stay in line and get to your campsite.

167
00:10:16,957 --> 00:10:19,155
Excuse me,
we're looking for some Internet.

168
00:10:19,415 --> 00:10:21,532
- Yeah, they've got it here.
- All right!

169
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:25,615
But there ain't enough to go around.
All they got is a little Internet.

170
00:10:25,735 --> 00:10:27,473
Barely a bar a signal.

171
00:10:27,823 --> 00:10:29,832
So they have to ration it out,
carefully.

172
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:32,001
Ya... sign up over there and

173
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:33,718
use your time when they call your name.

174
00:10:33,838 --> 00:10:36,709
Each family gets 40
seconds of Internet per day.

175
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:40,495
Forty seconds? That ain't even
long enough to check Wikipedia!

176
00:10:40,615 --> 00:10:42,887
Well it's all we got,
so we gotta make do.

177
00:10:43,147 --> 00:10:45,472
Look, honey,
we ordered us some books on Amazon.

178
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:46,906
All right, time's up.

179
00:10:47,026 --> 00:10:49,689
No! No wait! I haven't
entered the shipping information!

180
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:51,623
No! No!

181
00:10:51,887 --> 00:10:54,106
Next? Brady, John H.

182
00:10:54,366 --> 00:10:57,516
Aw, how am I supposed
to see Internet porn that way?

183
00:10:57,896 --> 00:11:00,741
- What did you say?
- Uh, you go ahead, Sharon.

184
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:04,575
Divide some Internet amongst
the children. I- gotta talk to somebody.

185
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:11,521
<i>And that's about all we know.</i>

186
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:15,813
Uh, there might be some Internet still
in California and parts of Florida,

187
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:18,783
though we certainly
still don't have any here.

188
00:11:20,115 --> 00:11:22,960
- A fax! A fax is coming through!
- Oh yeah, a fax!

189
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,630
- A fax! It's a fax, it's a fax!
- It's a fax, we got a fax!

190
00:11:27,642 --> 00:11:28,642
It says,

191
00:11:28,762 --> 00:11:31,745
"The government has sent
their best people to the Internet

192
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:33,515
in order to repair it."

193
00:11:34,706 --> 00:11:37,733
We've gotta send a reporter
out to the Internet!

194
00:11:39,723 --> 00:11:41,623
Where... is... the Internet?

195
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:53,131
Gentlemen,

196
00:11:53,251 --> 00:11:57,128
the President is very angry
that his Internet still isn't working.

197
00:11:57,388 --> 00:11:58,835
We've tried everything, sir,

198
00:11:58,955 --> 00:12:02,133
but the Internet has slowed to a trickle
and we can't get it working correctly.

199
00:12:02,393 --> 00:12:05,843
Take me down below!
I want to see the Internet for myself!

200
00:12:10,955 --> 00:12:12,455
Here it is, general.

201
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:13,918
The Internet.

202
00:12:21,347 --> 00:12:22,632
What's wrong with it?

203
00:12:22,752 --> 00:12:25,552
See that flashing orange
light in the middle?

204
00:12:25,677 --> 00:12:27,777
It's supposed to be solid green.

205
00:12:30,855 --> 00:12:32,055
My God.

206
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,176
"Thedancingkitty.com",
I wonder what that is.

207
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:42,867
"Click on the dancing kitty
and you could win a prize!"

208
00:12:42,987 --> 00:12:44,187
All right, time's up.

209
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:47,194
No, wait, I just clicked
on the kitty. I got it.

210
00:12:47,314 --> 00:12:49,788
No! It wasn't long enough! No!

211
00:12:50,134 --> 00:12:52,058
Next? Nelson, Peter T.

212
00:12:52,758 --> 00:12:56,753
Excuse me, I need to uh,
have some private Internet time.

213
00:12:56,903 --> 00:13:01,453
Look, we're just trying to get by here.
Everyone's gotta take what they can get.

214
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:04,874
I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.

215
00:13:06,157 --> 00:13:07,357
So jack off.

216
00:13:07,477 --> 00:13:10,727
You don't understand.
I need the Internet to jack off.

217
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:12,194
I...

218
00:13:12,314 --> 00:13:15,674
got used to being able to see anything
at the click of a button, you know?

219
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,433
Once you jack off to Japanese
girls puking in each other's mouths

220
00:13:18,553 --> 00:13:20,578
you can't exactly go back to Playboy!

221
00:13:20,698 --> 00:13:21,898
What do you want us to do?

222
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:25,175
Pick up the whole computer and put
it inside for ten minutes just for you?

223
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:28,045
- Three minutes would be plenty.
- Get lost!

224
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,322
All right, each of you take a ticket.

225
00:13:33,442 --> 00:13:35,393
When they call your name
you can use the Internet.

226
00:13:35,653 --> 00:13:38,553
- What number are you, turd?
- Eight fifty one.

227
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:42,296
- You're nine twenty three now.
- Hey! Mom!

228
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:44,825
Shelley, give your
brother his ticket back!

229
00:13:44,945 --> 00:13:48,866
Can't you all see I'm in pain?
Nobody understands pure love!

230
00:13:48,986 --> 00:13:52,495
Amir and I are closer than
anybody in this stupid family!

231
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,002
Hey!

232
00:13:59,122 --> 00:14:00,122
Over here!

233
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:04,608
You... happen to be
looking for Internet porn?

234
00:14:04,728 --> 00:14:06,242
Yeah, how'd you know?

235
00:14:06,362 --> 00:14:09,051
Lots of us fellas came
here for that reason.

236
00:14:09,171 --> 00:14:13,074
We all got used to seeing lots of
really pervrted stuff on the Internet,

237
00:14:13,194 --> 00:14:15,414
so now we can't go back to Playboy.

238
00:14:15,534 --> 00:14:19,154
- I know, right?
- Anyway, we got us a simulator.

239
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:22,724
You just call out what you
wanna see and then say "click."

240
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:26,887
- "Internet Porn Simulator"
- Give it a try.

241
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,283


242
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:36,393
Japanese girls exchanging
bodily fluids? Click.

243
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,209
Oh this sucks! I can't jack off to this!

244
00:14:46,974 --> 00:14:48,174
Damnit.

245
00:14:49,315 --> 00:14:52,303
Let's see. Interracial gang bang Click.

246
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,339
Shemales! Let's try shemales. Click.

247
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,354
Bestiality? Click on that.

248
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:07,918
Brazilian fart fetish porn?
Click! Click!

249
00:15:11,386 --> 00:15:13,877
No. No, this isn't going to work.

250
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:18,219
It's just not the same.

251
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:19,897
Well, sorry.

252
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:22,467
And that'll be $49 on your credit card.

253
00:15:22,831 --> 00:15:25,002
Well at least that
part's like the Internet.

254
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:28,964
We now have a reporter on the scene.
Let's go live!

255
00:15:29,816 --> 00:15:31,888
Tom, I'm at the Internet,

256
00:15:32,008 --> 00:15:35,888
where government officials are doing
their best to get it running again.

257
00:15:37,163 --> 00:15:40,224
All right, Internet.
What do you want from us?

258
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:47,483
If we've angered you somehow,
let us know.

259
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,945
Try to communicate
with it digitally again.

260
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:17,866
I've had it with this thing!
Fire a warning shot at it!

261
00:16:23,457 --> 00:16:25,479
Hey, wait a minute.

262
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:29,089
Is it possible that...

263
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:31,011
What is it, Kyle?

264
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:34,738
I think... I know what's wrong.

265
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,379
This is taking too long!
When do I get to use the Internet?

266
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:49,584
It's gotta be our turn soon.

267
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:53,007
All right, folks, it's bed time.
No more Internet for today.

268
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,180
No, no, we're locking it away
until tomorrow. Everyone get to bed!

269
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,164
Finally!

270
00:17:29,434 --> 00:17:30,784
I'm online again!

271
00:17:31,202 --> 00:17:32,402
Yes!

272
00:17:33,297 --> 00:17:37,373
Japanese girls puking
each other's mouths.

273
00:17:43,547 --> 00:17:44,904
Oh nice...

274
00:17:51,545 --> 00:17:54,814
Now let's see some bestiality.

275
00:18:03,837 --> 00:18:04,838
Yes!

276
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:08,653
Let's get some Brazilian
fart porn in there!

277
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:14,964
Oh that's good eh!

278
00:18:19,778 --> 00:18:20,978
What is that?

279
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:24,048
Sounds like someone's
being attacked by a tiger.

280
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:28,034
Get the keys! We gotta get in there.

281
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:38,679
What the...?

282
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,489
- Dad?
- Randy!

283
00:18:42,281 --> 00:18:44,331
There was a, there was a ghost!

284
00:18:44,604 --> 00:18:46,443
And this, this ectoplasm!

285
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:50,165
Did you see the ghost?
It ran through here; it slimed me!

286
00:18:50,704 --> 00:18:51,959
You son of a bitch!

287
00:18:52,302 --> 00:18:55,102
Oh no it wasn't me,
it was this spooky ghost!

288
00:18:57,055 --> 00:18:58,886
This is our last chance.

289
00:18:59,077 --> 00:19:01,679
With nowhere else to turn,
the government is going to allow

290
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,470
ne brave nine-year-old boy

291
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,682
to attempt his method to
get the Internet running again.

292
00:19:07,526 --> 00:19:09,135
<i>It all comes down to this.</i>

293
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:11,729
<i>Can the little Jewish
boy reason with the Internet?</i>

294
00:19:11,989 --> 00:19:13,839
<i>Or will it be gone forever?</i>

295
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,275
All clear for procedure.

296
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,569
All right! Let's do it!

297
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:43,761
Look! The flashing
yellow light is green now!

298
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:45,266
He did it!

299
00:19:45,386 --> 00:19:47,055
- I've got Internet!
- Me too!

300
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:49,715
Internet activity in all sectors, sir.

301
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,875
- I've got Internet.
- Me too!

302
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,013
It's back!

303
00:20:00,406 --> 00:20:01,956
It's back? It's back!

304
00:20:03,431 --> 00:20:07,532
It's working!
I can i-chat with my darling Amir now!

305
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:10,579
Shelley. Shelley Marsh?

306
00:20:12,014 --> 00:20:13,464
- What?
- It's me.

307
00:20:13,786 --> 00:20:14,958
Amir.

308
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:17,544
O... kay.

309
00:20:17,886 --> 00:20:19,936
Your family came here too, huh?

310
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:23,008
Yeah.

311
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:28,902
So uh, I guess I'll e-mail
you as soon as I get back home.

312
00:20:29,022 --> 00:20:31,823
- Yeah, okay. Sounds good.
- Okay, see ya.

313
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:36,402
We're back together!
We're back together!

314
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:41,443


315
00:20:42,626 --> 00:20:44,905
And so what have we
learned through this ordeal?

316
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,867
The Internet went away. It came back.

317
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:51,371
But for how long we do not know.

318
00:20:52,314 --> 00:20:55,414
We cannot take the Internet
for granted any longer.

319
00:20:55,773 --> 00:20:58,919
We as a country must
stop over-logging -on.

320
00:20:59,428 --> 00:21:02,548
We must use the Internet
only when we need it.

321
00:21:02,978 --> 00:21:06,468
It's easy for us to think we can
just use up all the Internet we want.

322
00:21:07,153 --> 00:21:10,848
But if we don't treat the
Internet with the respect...!

323
00:21:12,757 --> 00:21:14,107
That it deserves,

324
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,066
it could one day be gone forever.

325
00:21:17,923 --> 00:21:21,189
So let us learn to live
with the Internet, not for it.

326
00:21:21,486 --> 00:21:23,322
No more browsing
for no apparent reason,

327
00:21:23,442 --> 00:21:27,281
no more mindlessly surfing on
our laptops while watching television.

328
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:28,634
And finally,

329
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:33,012
we must learn to only use
the Internet for porn twice a day.

330
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:35,067
Max.
