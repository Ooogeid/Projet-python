Season 13 Episode 1
"The Ring"

2
00:00:36,215 --> 00:00:37,569
Would you look at that?

3
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:39,873
It's just incredible, isn't it?

4
00:00:40,523 --> 00:00:43,889
I still can't believe it,
even though it's right in front of me.

5
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:46,003
Yeah, it's just so... astounding!

6
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:49,372
Well believe it, friends.
The impossible has happened.

7
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,301
Kenny has a girlfriend.

8
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:55,077
Yeah, a fifth grade girlfriend.

9
00:00:55,202 --> 00:00:57,813
This is serious. They been going out
for almost two weeks now.

10
00:00:57,938 --> 00:01:00,528
- So... who is she?
- Her name's Tammy Warner.

11
00:01:00,653 --> 00:01:03,646
She's the only girl in school who's
family is actually poorer than Kenny's.

12
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:06,774
It's really kind of beautiful,
if you'll ask me.

13
00:01:07,157 --> 00:01:09,894
You, guys! You, guys,
I think we have a big problem!

14
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:11,420
- What?
- Well,

15
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,377
apparently Kenny has a girlfriend!

16
00:01:14,627 --> 00:01:16,775
Yeah dude, Tammy Warner,
she is a fifth-grader.

17
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,295
Does Kenny like her?

18
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,621
I guess so, she's like
his first will girlfriend ever.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,708
- Oh, no! Oh, jeez!
- Butters, what's the problem?

20
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:27,421
I've just talked to Brad Dickson.
Tammy Warner is bad news.

21
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,413
All the fifth-graders
call her a slut.

22
00:01:29,538 --> 00:01:33,538
On account that she gave Dave Darsky
a BJ in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.

23
00:01:34,309 --> 00:01:35,859
- What?
- It's true!

24
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:38,848
Ask anybody in fifth grade!
Tammy Warner is a total slut!

25
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,312
That bitch!

26
00:01:40,562 --> 00:01:43,310
Kenny's gave his heart to her
and she just gonna throw it in face.

27
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:45,291
Kenny deserves to know, fellas.

28
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:49,267
If you guys found up my girlfriend was
a raging whore, I'd want you to tell me.

29
00:01:51,218 --> 00:01:52,737
All right... come on, guys.

30
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:57,186
Hey, Jimmy. What's a BJ?

31
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,303
{\So anyway I passed him a note
but then Johnny got...}

32
00:02:01,427 --> 00:02:03,519
- Kenny! Hey, Kenny!
- (Hey, guys.)

33
00:02:04,284 --> 00:02:07,203
Listen, Kenny.
We need to talk about your new friend.

34
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:08,328
(What about her?)

35
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:11,267
- Oh, boy...
- Kenny,

36
00:02:11,517 --> 00:02:13,767
we know
you really like this girl, but...

37
00:02:13,892 --> 00:02:14,983
(But what?)

38
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,832
Well... we've heard that she's...

39
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:22,053
Kenny! Your girlfriend
is a notorious whore.

40
00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:24,812
She even gave a kid
named Dave Darsky a BJ

41
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,387
in a parking lot of TGI Friday's.

42
00:02:28,663 --> 00:02:30,351
Your girlfriend is a slut, dude.

43
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,867
He took it pretty well.

44
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,664
- (Hi, Tammy!)
- Hi, Ken.

45
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,651
You decided what
you wanna do after school?

46
00:02:45,776 --> 00:02:47,982
(I was thinking
we should go to TGI Friday's.)

47
00:02:48,107 --> 00:02:50,854
- TGI Friday's?
- (Yeah, could be lots of fun!)

48
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:51,921
Yeah, OK.

49
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:53,555
But...

50
00:02:54,464 --> 00:02:58,366
Kenny, listen. There's something
I need to tell you about.

51
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:00,508
There's a lot of rumors
going around about me.

52
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:02,358
That I agreed to give a boy a BJ.

53
00:03:02,943 --> 00:03:04,626
Well, It's true.

54
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:07,083
But it was before
you and I were together,

55
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,776
and it wasn't my fault.

56
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:11,205
See, I was watching
the Disney Channel.

57
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,657
And that show came on,
with the Jonas Brothers.

58
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:16,642
- (Jonas Brothers?)
- You know that teenage boy band?

59
00:03:17,036 --> 00:03:19,710
Every time I see them
I get so... tingly.

60
00:03:19,835 --> 00:03:21,605
I just completely lose control.

61
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,906
And then Dave Darsky showed up
and took me to the TGI Friday's.

62
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:26,874
And... It just happened.

63
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:30,054
But it was only for one second
and I had my eyes closed.

64
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:31,787
I know it's terrible.

65
00:03:32,615 --> 00:03:34,875
Can you... can you forgive me, Ken?

66
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:44,391
There you are, young man. Two tickets
to the Jonas Brothers concert.

67
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:45,599
(Thanks!)

68
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,538
The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny,
what the hell is wrong with you?

69
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,679
Aren't they those queermos
on the Disney Channel?

70
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:54,367
(They get Tammy all hot
and then she'll give me a BJ.)

71
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:56,646
- A BJ?
- You want Tammy to give you a BJ?

72
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:58,155
(Of course, dude!)

73
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,475
Kenny! You gonna let a girl
put her mouth on your wiener?

74
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,445
Do you know how disgusting that is?

75
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,449
- Girl's mouths are full of germs!
- Yeah, dude, that's gross.

76
00:04:06,574 --> 00:04:08,998
- (It's OK, I'll have protection.)
- What kind of protection?

77
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:11,834
(A box of condoms, please?)

78
00:04:12,638 --> 00:04:15,546
Box of condoms? Certainly, little boy.
What kind would you like?

79
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:19,645
- (I'll take those over there.)
- These here? Certainly.

80
00:04:21,658 --> 00:04:22,887
(Cool!)

81
00:04:23,557 --> 00:04:25,513
Kenny, aren't you
a little too young for this?

82
00:04:25,638 --> 00:04:27,292
(I'm not young, I want a BJ!)

83
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:29,868
Just because you've got condoms
doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny.

84
00:04:29,993 --> 00:04:33,050
Statistically speaking, the most
bacteria-ridden place on the planet

85
00:04:33,175 --> 00:04:34,648
is the mouth of an American woman.

86
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:36,869
And you're gonna
let that near your penis?

87
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:42,031
{\THE JONAS BROTHERS
LIVE - TONIGHT}

88
00:04:48,316 --> 00:04:51,123
Kenny, you're the best for
bringing me here. Isn't this awesome?

89
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,886
<i>I'm ready... to get it on.</i>

90
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,680
<i>But there's no getting on,</i>

91
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:08,378
<i>till I'm ready.</i>

92
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,725
<i>It's too soon.</i>

93
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:12,831
<i>Slow down.</i>

94
00:05:13,476 --> 00:05:15,497
<i>- Take it easy, young girl.</i>
- My giny tickles!

95
00:05:15,622 --> 00:05:17,453
<i>I need your love, baby!</i>

96
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:21,674
<i>- Can't wait till the day I kiss you.</i>
- Oh, my God! It's start tingling again!

97
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:25,115
<i>Until then I have to tease you.</i>

98
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:27,493
<i>'Cause my mom doesn't like it</i>

99
00:05:27,774 --> 00:05:29,684
<i>- when I'm naughty.</i>
- I love you!

100
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:32,166
<i>She'll make me clean my room</i>

101
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,162
<i>if I'm naughty, baby!</i>

102
00:05:35,688 --> 00:05:37,512
<i>- I'm hot...
- He's hot...</i>

103
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,130
<i>	Tell me how was I to know...</i>

104
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:43,133
<i>You'd take your love and go?</i>

105
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:46,695
<i>Was it 'cause I wanted to wait</i>

106
00:05:46,945 --> 00:05:50,671
<i>till we were married
to put my arm around you?</i>

107
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,601
<i>Seasons change,</i>

108
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,810
<i>baby.</i>

109
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:56,427
<i>And the world goes around you
round, round...</i>

110
00:05:56,552 --> 00:05:59,100
<i>Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna take my time,</i>

111
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,945
<i>Can't wait till you are mine
but it might be a while.</i>

112
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,012
<i>'Cause... Yeah, yeah, girl,
we can take it slow.</i>

113
00:06:06,137 --> 00:06:09,702
<i>So we have room to grow,
and then someday we can do it call!</i>

114
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,913
You're so hot, Kevin,
I love you too!

115
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,040
<i>Until then, go back to Montreal.</i>

116
00:06:16,548 --> 00:06:18,918
<i>'Cause I still love you, baby...</i>

117
00:06:19,043 --> 00:06:20,533
<i>Love you, baby!</i>

118
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,041
<i>Baby!</i>

119
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:27,450
<i>Good night, Denver, we love you all!</i>

120
00:06:27,575 --> 00:06:29,181
<i>We love you, Denver!</i>

121
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,356
<i>Good night!</i>

122
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:37,769
Oh, my God! I'm so worked up.

123
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:40,540
- I just want to attack you, Kenny!
- (All right!)

124
00:06:40,665 --> 00:06:42,139
(Let's go to the parking lot!)

125
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:46,784
And you too, little girl in the red.

126
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:50,288
Band want you to come backstage.

127
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:52,453
You too,
little girl with the puppy t-shirt.

128
00:06:54,772 --> 00:06:57,272
They want me to come backstage?
Oh, my God!

129
00:06:57,397 --> 00:07:00,699
- (But, we have to do another thing!)
- It's a dream come true!

130
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:04,476
All right, right this way, girls.

131
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:07,014
Yeah, come on in everyone.
The band is waiting for you.

132
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:10,239
- Oh, not you.
- (Fuck that, I bought the tickets!)

133
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:13,248
(Hey, let me in!)

134
00:07:14,118 --> 00:07:16,351
Jonas Brothers
will be right out, girls.

135
00:07:17,096 --> 00:07:18,645
Why did they call us back here?

136
00:07:19,076 --> 00:07:21,065
They must wanna have sex with us.

137
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:24,321
- What? You think so?
- Sure, they're a band.

138
00:07:24,571 --> 00:07:27,154
They called us back here
so we can give 'em blowjobs.

139
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,509
I'm not doing it.

140
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:30,877
Just 'cause they're rockstars
doesn't mean I'll do that.

141
00:07:31,002 --> 00:07:32,802
I'm not giving a blowjob to anybody!

142
00:07:32,927 --> 00:07:35,227
- Me neither.
- Here we are, girls!

143
00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:40,122
Hey, listen.
We saw ya out there in the audience.

144
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:42,503
Yeah, you were getting
a little crazy out there.

145
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,172
Let's just get to the blow jobs.

146
00:07:46,017 --> 00:07:47,091
Blow-what?

147
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,568
I don't know.
Look, we called you back here

148
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:52,007
because we want to share
our love of Christ with you.

149
00:07:52,132 --> 00:07:54,098
And see if you wear
purity rings from now on.

150
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:55,766
Purity rings?

151
00:07:56,164 --> 00:07:57,928
We're all wear purity rings.

152
00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:01,627
It means we're going to be pure,
and not have sex until we married.

153
00:08:01,752 --> 00:08:03,608
And It means
we stay away from bad stuff

154
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,026
and avoid people who swear
or watch naughty TV shows.

155
00:08:06,428 --> 00:08:08,070
That's just how we roll.

156
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:09,631
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

157
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,106
So what do you say, girls.

158
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:14,785
You want to be kid hipsters
like us and wear purity rings too?

159
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:16,954
OK.

160
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:20,017
And be sure you give a ring
to all the kids you care about,

161
00:08:20,142 --> 00:08:22,442
'cause it's the new hip way to roll.

162
00:08:28,652 --> 00:08:30,991
Well, well, well...
Here he comes.

163
00:08:31,116 --> 00:08:33,303
It's a BJ McKay
and his best friend Bear.

164
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:35,316
So how did it go last night?

165
00:08:40,797 --> 00:08:42,897
- What's that?
- (A purity ring.)

166
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:46,042
- Purity ring?
- (Yeah, a purity ring.)

167
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:48,013
What does that mean?

168
00:08:48,138 --> 00:08:51,125
(It means I'm gonna be pure
and not have sex until I get married.)

169
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,205
You? We thought you really wanted
to have a BJ before you got too old...

170
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,820
(I did! I was excited to get a BJ,
but now I have to wear this ring!)

171
00:08:57,945 --> 00:08:59,598
All right, Kenny, calm down!

172
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:01,767
You're too young
to be getting BJs anyway!

173
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:05,475
It's good you and Tammy are making
a commitment that isn't based on sex.

174
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
(Yeah!)

175
00:09:09,513 --> 00:09:11,846
(It isn't fair, I was so close
to getting a blow job!)

176
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:14,391
(And I'll never get one now!)

177
00:09:20,783 --> 00:09:22,186
Fellas, hey, fellas!

178
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:26,231
I heard that Kenny is still going out
with that slut, Tammy Warner!

179
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,442
It's OK, they have purity rings now.

180
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:30,546
- What's that?
- Rings that says

181
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:33,361
they not gonna have sex
or doing anything naughty anymore.

182
00:09:34,577 --> 00:09:37,877
A ring that says you'll be
together but not have sex...

183
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,836
Isn't that called the wedding ring?

184
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,921
<i>I've got a ring on my finger
to remind me what I cannot do.</i>

185
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:55,594
<i>Can't just do whatever I feel like
I've got to stay righteous and true.</i>

186
00:09:58,256 --> 00:10:01,600
<i>I can't hang out with my buddies
and get into trouble,</i>

187
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:05,351
<i>'Cause now we're both wearing
these rings for each other</i>

188
00:10:05,476 --> 00:10:07,981
<i>But who needs sex,
and drugs, and partying,</i>

189
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:12,354
<i>When we can cook a meal
then sit around and watch Netflix.</i>

190
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,871
<i>Baby!</i>

191
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:20,555
<i>I've got a ring on my finger
to remind me that I must behave.</i>

192
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:27,397
<i>No need to chase after girls,
it's a promise I can never break.</i>

193
00:10:30,245 --> 00:10:33,131
<i>I made a commitment
and it is forever.</i>

194
00:10:33,452 --> 00:10:36,468
<i>So we can spend
every waking minute together.</i>

195
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,805
<i>And If we get bored,
it won't be a problem,</i>

196
00:10:40,194 --> 00:10:44,194
<i>'cause we can just hang out with other
couples who wear these rings.</i>

197
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:45,815
<i>Baby!</i>

198
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,237
Yeah, we've found out
that once you wear purity rings

199
00:10:48,362 --> 00:10:50,507
it's best to hang out
with other couples that do.

200
00:10:50,632 --> 00:10:52,838
Got more in common,
isn't that right, Sarah?

201
00:10:52,963 --> 00:10:55,230
What Carol and I really enjoy
is <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>.

202
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,278
We love <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>,
don't we, Carol?

203
00:10:57,403 --> 00:11:00,004
We adore Gray's Anatomy,
don't we, Nancy?

204
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:01,149
Adore it!

205
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:03,481
Kenny and Tammy,
do you watch <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>?

206
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:07,442
We look forward to it all week long!

207
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:11,011
- Sure is!
- Most fun we've had in weeks!

208
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:15,007
<i>I got a ring on my finger
to remind me what I cannot do.</i>

209
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:16,359
<i>Baby!</i>

210
00:11:18,653 --> 00:11:21,936
- <i>Baby!</i>
- <i>Baby!</i>

211
00:11:25,624 --> 00:11:28,645
And... cut! Great video shoot, guys!

212
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:32,232
- This is bull pucky!
- Yeah, we've had it, gosh darn it!

213
00:11:33,873 --> 00:11:35,902
Looks like we've got a problem.

214
00:11:37,056 --> 00:11:38,746
Our decision is final!

215
00:11:38,871 --> 00:11:42,644
We've decided, as a band,
not to wear purity rings anymore!

216
00:11:42,894 --> 00:11:45,529
- Yeah, you tell them, Joe.
- Boys, I know you're tired.

217
00:11:45,654 --> 00:11:48,165
But the purity rings are important
for the company's image!

218
00:11:48,772 --> 00:11:50,751
We don't care about the company!

219
00:11:51,225 --> 00:11:53,378
And you gonna say that
to the boss's face?

220
00:11:53,718 --> 00:11:55,522
We are... we aren't afraid of him.

221
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:58,603
I hope you're right,
because the boss is on his way here.

222
00:11:58,728 --> 00:12:00,927
- Now!
- Oh Jesus, he's here, boss is here!

223
00:12:02,026 --> 00:12:05,533
- Let's be strong, guys.
- Hello, sir. How was your trip?

224
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:09,478
What's all this I'm hearing
about not wearing the purity rings?

225
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,829
We'll just leave you alone.

226
00:12:12,526 --> 00:12:14,726
So... I guess we have some issues?

227
00:12:15,182 --> 00:12:17,553
We... need to talk about something.

228
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,033
Oh, boy!

229
00:12:19,158 --> 00:12:21,908
I just love flying
all the way to Colorado

230
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,161
to hear about your problems!

231
00:12:24,688 --> 00:12:27,323
Look, we just want our concerts
to be about our music,

232
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:29,117
and not about purity rings.

233
00:12:29,242 --> 00:12:32,918
Oh, gosh, fellas. Let me explain this
to you one more time.

234
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:35,834
You have to wear the purity rings,

235
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:39,059
because that's how
we can sell sex to little girls.

236
00:12:39,556 --> 00:12:43,458
See, if we make the posters with little
girls reaching for your junk,

237
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,473
then you have to wear purity rings,

238
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,262
or else Disney Company looks bad.

239
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,311
But we don't want to be
selling sex to little girls anymore!

240
00:12:51,915 --> 00:12:53,605
The rings stay on!

241
00:12:54,128 --> 00:12:58,020
Well... well... maybe we'll just
refuse to go on stage!

242
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,260
You don't... fucking...

243
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,282
talk to me... like that!

244
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:07,446
You little... piece of shit!

245
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:11,790
Get the fuck up.
Get the fuck up!

246
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,013
Now, do we have a problem?

247
00:13:17,784 --> 00:13:19,969
- No, sir.
- No, Mr. Mouse.

248
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:21,583
No, Mr. Mouse.

249
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,469
That's good, 'cause I thought
we had a problem for a minute here.

250
00:13:25,044 --> 00:13:28,341
All right, now get out of there
and make me some goddamn money!

251
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:33,423
Yep, he is in here.

252
00:13:34,294 --> 00:13:35,761
Dude, what are you doing?

253
00:13:35,886 --> 00:13:39,338
This is the day we're supposed
to throw cow turds at cars together.

254
00:13:39,463 --> 00:13:41,064
We've had just about enough, dude.

255
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:43,507
You've been blowing us off
for two weeks, now what's up?

256
00:13:43,632 --> 00:13:45,824
(Need to buy... more DVDs.)

257
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:48,521
<i>Grey's Anatomy</i>?

258
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:51,329
Kenny! What kind of douchebag
garbage are you watching?

259
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:55,159
Come on, Kenny, this isn't you.
We want you back, dude.

260
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:58,024
Kenny... Kenny... Kenny?

261
00:13:58,149 --> 00:13:59,672
Wanna look at Playboys?

262
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,189
Wanna get high sniffing paint?
Kenny?

263
00:14:02,314 --> 00:14:04,417
You want your <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> back?

264
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:08,080
(<i>Grey's Anatomy</i>, cool!
This was a great season!)

265
00:14:08,373 --> 00:14:10,356
(Look at that, this is so cool!)

266
00:14:10,605 --> 00:14:13,845
You guys, this is serious.
Something is really wrong with him.

267
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,086
It's that ring!

268
00:14:15,211 --> 00:14:18,557
Somehow putting on that ring
has turned Kenny into a boring turd!

269
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:21,497
Oh, my God!
Look at this! Motherfucker!

270
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:23,074
What?

271
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,823
"Jonas Brothers: talk music,
faith in God and purity rings."

272
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:29,969
These Disney douchebags
are the ones causing all this!

273
00:14:30,094 --> 00:14:32,457
Yeah, this all happened the day
after he went to their concert!

274
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:33,481
Come on guys.

275
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,036
We're not sitting back
and watching our friend die.

276
00:14:37,987 --> 00:14:40,469
Hold tight, buddy.
We're gonna find a cure for you.

277
00:14:43,865 --> 00:14:46,862
<i>Live from 5 News Studio in Colorado,</i>

278
00:14:47,112 --> 00:14:49,221
<i>It's </i>Good Mornin' Denver<i>!</i>

279
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:52,967
We are joined this morning
by the Disney supergroup...

280
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,192
the Jonas Brothers. Hello, boys!

281
00:14:56,545 --> 00:14:58,429
- Hello!
- Now tell us what you're doing

282
00:14:58,554 --> 00:15:00,306
here in Denver, guys.

283
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,387
We're gonna be doing
a live concert from Red Rocks tonight,

284
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:05,706
that will be live broadcast
on the Disney Channel.

285
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:07,948
And 3-D.
Don't forget to mention in 3-D!

286
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:10,420
Oh, and it's gonna be in 3-D.

287
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:15,173
Now guys, a lot has been made
about your purity rings.

288
00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:17,058
Can you tell us about those?

289
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,183
Well...

290
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:21,933
We... We wear these to symbolize
how pure we are and how we...

291
00:15:22,058 --> 00:15:24,306
don't approve of things
that are naughty or filthy.

292
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:26,283
Good. Get a close up
on their purity rings.

293
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:27,759
Close up on the purity rings.

294
00:15:28,423 --> 00:15:30,610
That's wonderful, boys.
It's good that little girls

295
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:32,973
can see a concert
and not have it be about sex.

296
00:15:33,406 --> 00:15:35,271
We understand
that at the concert tonight,

297
00:15:35,396 --> 00:15:39,125
you'll be dousing girls in the audience
with white foam, is that correct?

298
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,630
Yeah.

299
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,482
Can we give our audience a peek?

300
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,960
What do you say, you want
the Jonas Brothers to douse you

301
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:46,216
with their white foam?

302
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,061
Oh, boy! This is TV-gold!

303
00:15:54,131 --> 00:15:56,496
- Excuse us, excuse us!
- What do you think you're doing?

304
00:15:57,055 --> 00:15:58,331
Great stuff, boys!

305
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,459
You like taking the Jonas Brother's
hot foam in your faces, girls?

306
00:16:04,952 --> 00:16:06,887
Those Jonas Brothers are assholes!

307
00:16:07,012 --> 00:16:09,342
Yeah, their purity rings turned
our friend into a douche!

308
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,971
What the hell do you think you're doing
spreading this crap to kids?

309
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,410
Who the hell are these guys?
Are they from DreamWorks?

310
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:19,269
Goddamn Eisner trying
to hurt this company again?

311
00:16:19,663 --> 00:16:23,119
This whole thing is a freaking shame!
I see what you're doing now.

312
00:16:23,244 --> 00:16:24,954
You're trying to sell sex
to young girls.

313
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:26,581
And then confuse them by...

314
00:16:29,474 --> 00:16:30,280
Cartman?

315
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,366
You aren't ruining my plans
this time, DreamWorks.

316
00:16:34,268 --> 00:16:36,168
Dude, who the hell did that?

317
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:45,458
<i>Fifteen minutes,
that's fifteen minutes, people!</i>

318
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,626
<i>Get another mike on that drum kit.</i>

319
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:49,751
<i>They almost ruined everything.</i>

320
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:52,344
<i>How did something like this happen?</i>

321
00:16:55,674 --> 00:16:57,954
<i>Wake up, wake up, you little prick!</i>

322
00:16:58,876 --> 00:17:00,894
Who do you work for, DreamWorks?

323
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,130
Answer me!

324
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:07,678
- We don't work for anybody.
- Oh boy, I sure believe that!

325
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:12,072
You just try to ruin Disney Company's
big night for your own amusement.

326
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:15,408
- What the hell did you do to us?
- Shut up!

327
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:19,113
<i>And now, Disney Channel presents...</i>

328
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:22,707
<i>The Jonas Brothers
3D concert spectacular!</i>

329
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:26,282
<i>Live from Red Rocks
Amphitheatre in Colorado.</i>

330
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:30,366
Truly a night of magic as we are set

331
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:32,890
for the biggest concert
event of the year.

332
00:17:33,015 --> 00:17:34,248
In about ten minutes

333
00:17:34,373 --> 00:17:37,722
the Jonas Brothers are going to take
the stage in what Disney is calling

334
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,059
<i>the most pure and innocent
rock event of the millennia.</i>

335
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:44,802
Do we put
the 3D glasses on now, dadda?

336
00:17:45,052 --> 00:17:46,231
Not yet, Keidy.

337
00:17:46,724 --> 00:17:48,900
<i>Everyone around
the country is tuning in to see</i>

338
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,218
<i>Disney's latest kid pop stars.</i>

339
00:17:51,531 --> 00:17:53,738
(Yeah, Jonas Brothers at Red Rocks.)

340
00:17:54,589 --> 00:17:57,022
We understand
the Jonas Brothers are getting ready.

341
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:59,327
What's going on backstage
must be exciting.

342
00:18:00,822 --> 00:18:02,565
You better start talking.

343
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,846
You better start talking right now.

344
00:18:04,971 --> 00:18:07,228
We told you,
we aren't working for another studio

345
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,336
and there isn't a plan
to sabotage your big night.

346
00:18:09,461 --> 00:18:12,052
We came on our own 'cause
our friends purity ring is killing him.

347
00:18:12,177 --> 00:18:13,717
You're lying, I'll cut you up.

348
00:18:14,363 --> 00:18:16,886
You see?
We were right about the purity rings.

349
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:20,150
A nice Christian symbol
can't be used for profit gains.

350
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:23,947
- We're all angered God.
- You think God is in control here?

351
00:18:24,197 --> 00:18:27,220
I am in control,
I've been in control since the '50s

352
00:18:27,345 --> 00:18:30,876
if you haven't noticed.
You three faggots are going on stage.

353
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:33,676
And you three faggots
aren't gonna stop me.

354
00:18:33,801 --> 00:18:35,572
Nobody is ruining this event.

355
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:38,575
I've worked too long and too hard

356
00:18:39,048 --> 00:18:41,244
to have anyone fuck this up.

357
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:44,670
<i>Where would you be
without me, Jonas Brothers?</i>

358
00:18:44,795 --> 00:18:46,916
<i>Your music sucks and you know it.</i>

359
00:18:47,582 --> 00:18:50,737
It's because you make
little girls ginies tickle.

360
00:18:50,987 --> 00:18:54,758
And when little girls' ginies tickle,
I make money.

361
00:18:55,477 --> 00:18:59,387
<i>And that's because
little girls are fucking stupid.</i>

362
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:03,933
<i>And the purity rings
make it OK to do whatever I want.</i>

363
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,949
Even the Christians
are too fucking stupid

364
00:19:07,074 --> 00:19:09,606
to figure out I'm selling sex
to their daughters.

365
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:13,651
<i>I've made billions off of Christian
ignorance for decades now.</i>

366
00:19:14,435 --> 00:19:16,053
And do you know why?

367
00:19:16,178 --> 00:19:19,594
Because Christians are retarded.

368
00:19:20,303 --> 00:19:22,806
<i>They believe in a talking dead guy.</i>

369
00:19:30,185 --> 00:19:31,294
<i>Hello, folks!</i>

370
00:19:33,702 --> 00:19:36,299
<i>Take it easy.
Here's the Jonas Brothers.</i>

371
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,347
- C'mon guys.
<i>- No, stop! Bring them back here!</i>

372
00:19:42,762 --> 00:19:45,683
It's over Mr. Mouse.
Everyone's tuning out.

373
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:48,978
<i>No! No, goddamn it! No!</i>

374
00:19:51,185 --> 00:19:53,546
<i>Shut up! Shut up!</i>

375
00:20:01,129 --> 00:20:04,241
That's it, girls.
No more Disney TV for a while.

376
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Tom, the Disney Jonas Brothers
3D television special has failed.

377
00:20:09,981 --> 00:20:12,207
Costing the Disney Company millions.

378
00:20:12,332 --> 00:20:15,531
And once again, Mickey
is pissed off and throwing a fit.

379
00:20:15,656 --> 00:20:17,215
<i>Vengeance is mine.</i>

380
00:20:17,822 --> 00:20:20,872
<i>You are all ants
and I'm your destroyer.</i>

381
00:20:22,052 --> 00:20:26,052
The Disney purity ring venture will most
likely now prove a marketing bust.

382
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:29,811
As Mickey returns to Valhalla,
to slumber and feed.

383
00:20:36,065 --> 00:20:38,234
Oh, Ken. Look at what we've become.

384
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,585
We're way too young
to be this boring.

385
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,898
(OK, I'll put in <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>.)

386
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,106
No! I don't want to watch
<i>Grey's Anatomy</i>, Ken.

387
00:20:46,231 --> 00:20:49,103
- Let's take off these rings, Ken.
- (Take off the rings?)

388
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:51,183
(We can take off the rings? Really?)

389
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:53,649
Let's take them off
and just be kids again.

390
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:56,305
There will be plenty of time
to wear rings and be boring and lame

391
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,230
when we reach our late 30s
and be boring and lame anyway.

392
00:20:59,355 --> 00:21:01,255
(Yeah! Screw theses things!)

393
00:21:02,315 --> 00:21:04,865
- I feel better already.
- (Me too!)

394
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:08,518
Whats say you and me
go to TGI Friday's?

395
00:21:13,788 --> 00:21:14,606
And so,

396
00:21:15,187 --> 00:21:17,887
as we commit
this young child to the earth.

397
00:21:18,012 --> 00:21:19,662
Let us all be reminded,

398
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:22,530
that syphilis
is still a deadly disease.

399
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,450
And it can be caught
even if using protection.

400
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:27,242
This boy learned the hard way...

401
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:31,367
I told him. Woman's mouth is the most
germ-ridden place on earth I said.

402
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:34,967
Statistically the most unsafe place
for a man to put his penis, I said.

403
00:21:36,531 --> 00:21:38,098
Well, now we know.

404
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:40,757
And knowing is half the battle.

405
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:44,376
