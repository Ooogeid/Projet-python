Season 13 Episode 9
"Butters' Bottom Bitch"

3
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,786
All right, guys.
Gather all around.

4
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,080
Everyone should be a witness.
You ready?

5
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,833
Now say, "I'm a dork
and I deserve what's coming to me."

6
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,295
Come on, "I'm a dork
and I deserve what's coming to me."

7
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:49,090
I'm a dork and I deserve
what's coming to me.

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,886
Your turn, Craig.

9
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,595
My underwear is so far up
my butt crack, my legs are numb.

10
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,183
That's what you get
for being a douchebag.

11
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,060
- You gotta take your medicine!
- I guess I deserve it.

12
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,978
Why are you picking on him
this time?

13
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,734
You are not going to believe this.
You know what we just found out?

14
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,319
It turns out that Butters,
our Butters, has never kissed a girl.

15
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,200
- So what?
- So what?

16
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,910
I'm almost nine years old

17
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,871
and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl
by fourth grade is a dork.

18
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,039
That's right.

19
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,498
We got it!

20
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,754
We got it.
Sally Darson is selling kisses for $5.

21
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,171
Selling kisses?

22
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,134
She is behind the temp building
during afternoon recess.

23
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,509
She'll kiss any boy.

24
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,847
You mean
I'm gonna kiss a girl today?

25
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,060
When she sticks her tongue out,

26
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,020
you just kind of lick it with yours.

27
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,648
Oh, boy. I sure am nervous.

28
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,776
Nothing to be nervous about.
You're finally going to become a man.

29
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,777
- I think you should reconsider this.
- How come?

30
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,907
You don't want your first kiss
to be something you paid for.

31
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,240
It must be special.

32
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,370
Why don't you go sit under a rainbow
and write a poem, Kyle.

33
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,706
I gotta do this.
I gotta know what it feels like.

34
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,462
Oh, boy. Oh, jeez.
Stay calm, Butters.

35
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,007
How was it?

36
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,676
Pretty worth it.

37
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,056
Go ahead, Butters.
Go get some.

38
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,182
I'm going.

39
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,569
I was hoping
maybe I could get a kiss.

40
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,695
Okay, cool.

41
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,196
Yeah, cool.

42
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,409
So you got money?

43
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,411
Money, right.

44
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,539
There you go.
A five dollar bill, all for you.

45
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,418
All right.
You ready?

46
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:57,886
Thank you.

47
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,601
Atta boy, Butters!

48
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,519
You did it!

49
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,771
- You're a man!
- Nice job!

50
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,405
<i>Boy, oh, boy.
I finally did it.</i>

51
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,449
<i>I'm a man now.</i>

52
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,996
<i>Geez. I'm gonna start
having lots of responsibilities soon.</i>

53
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,582
<i>I gotta start
thinking about a career.</i>

54
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,460
<i>There's gonna be family and bills
to start worrying about.</i>

55
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,462
<i>No more playtime for you, Butters.</i>

56
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,548
<i>You gotta buckle down
and find yourself a way to make money.</i>

57
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:38,927
I know!

58
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,139
Hey, fellers!

59
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,725
Fellers, do you like getting kisses?

60
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,562
Because I know a girl
that'll give you a great kiss for $5.

61
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,938
She'll kiss anybody?

62
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,901
Sure, Scott.
Even if you got diabetes.

63
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,577
It's almost like
having someone care about you.

64
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,622
Thanks for bringing me
yet another customer.

65
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,125
- Here's your $2 cut again.
- Boy, oh, boy! This sure is great!

66
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,377
I been thinking.

67
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,671
I could drum up
some third grade customers

68
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,798
if you could do kisses
before school, too.

69
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,550
- We could make double the money.
- That'd be great!

70
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,136
But I can't do kisses before school.
I have swimming class.

71
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,513
Nuts!

72
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,140
Well, I did have another idea.

73
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:29,227
What if we got another girl
to fill in for you sometimes?

74
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,895
- What?
- You know.

75
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,897
We bring someone on,
show her what to do,

76
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,774
and then share our money together.

77
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,318
You're right, Butters.
I should start expanding.

78
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,405
We could have
our very own kissing company.

79
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,199
The next key
to a successful business is innovation.

80
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,496
Maybe we need to understand
that some boys simply can't afford

81
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,914
the $5 for a kiss.

82
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,374
So what if we start
also charging just $2 for a hug.

83
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:57,005
- That's a great idea, Butters.
- Thanks!

84
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,091
Sally, your position behind
the temp building at recess is perfect.

85
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,136
Meagan, I'm moving you
to the baseball field after school

86
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,219
- during little league practice.
- Got it.

87
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:09,390
I got a kissing booth at the kid's fair,
Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there.

88
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,145
Any girl that sells
more than twenty kisses gets...

89
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,688
a little sunshine.

90
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,150
But if you don't show up for work,
I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud.

91
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,610
This is gonna be great!

92
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,614
Sir, take a look at this.

93
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,285
We've got rumors coming in
of a possible prostitution company

94
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,828
starting up in South Park.

95
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,664
What?
Not in my county!

96
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,624
We've got no information,

97
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,710
don't who they are,
or where they came from.

98
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,129
So then we need
to go after the Johns.

99
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,882
Let the men of this town
know that if they pay for sex,

100
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,341
they're going to jail.

101
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,218
Sting operation, sir?

102
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,972
We need an undercover cop
disguised as a prostitute

103
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,017
so we can arrest any citizens
looking for cheap thrills.

104
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,153
Baby, you looking for a party?

105
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:06,491
- How much are you charging?
- 20 for oral, 50 for half and half.

106
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,326
Anal will cost you extra.

107
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,078
Get in.

108
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,751
Right here's good, sexy.

109
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,797
Now if you wouldn't mind
handing over the $20

110
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,423
for oral sex.

111
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,928
All right, buddy.

112
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,138
Go ahead and unbutton your pants.

113
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,559
All right.
Here we go.

114
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,439
Oh, man...

115
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:47,365
- Sorry I was so quick.
- That's okay. Nothing wrong with...

116
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,491
Freeze!

117
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,993
You're busted, buddy.
I'm a cop!

118
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,788
- What?
- This is a sting operation, scum bag.

119
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,998
You'll go to jail
for soliciting prostitution.

120
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,043
Got our first one.
I'm bringing him in for booking.

121
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,506
Did you hear what's going on?

122
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,509
There's four girls at the school now
offering to kiss boys for money.

123
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,303
I heard that.
Even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses.

124
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,142
Hey, fellas!
Would anybody like a coupon?

125
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,854
We are offering two for one kisses
today through Thursday.

126
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,564
You're the one doing all this?

127
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:24,485
I am founder and head CEO
of the Butter's kissing company.

128
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,778
Just look at this.

129
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,906
You made all that money
off of chicks?

130
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,576
It's the most genius idea
I ever came up with.

131
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,659
A lot of boys
will pay to kiss my employees.

132
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,582
You didn't think of anything.
Guys have been doing that for years.

133
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,876
You're nothing but a common pimp!

134
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,171
A pimp?

135
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,591
Kyle was right, Sally!

136
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,008
There's kissing companies
all over the country.

137
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:53,222
"The person managing
all the women is known as the pimp."

138
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,933
"While the working women
are referred to as

139
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,727
ho or bitch."

140
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,188
You're a bitch, Sally!

141
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,315
Look at this!

142
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,440
There's about to be
a big pimp convention.

143
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:08,196
I gotta get to that convention.
I could learn all kinds a stuff.

144
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,222
Hi, there!

145
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,640
My name is Butters.
This sure is a nice convention, huh?

146
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,395
I'm just starting out.
I really came last minute.

147
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,732
Because I was hoping to learn more
about being a successful pimp.

148
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,443
You?
You be pimping?

149
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,155
Just about a week now.
I have four girls at the moment,

150
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,824
but I feel like
I could be doing a better job.

151
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,958
Now see, you think you a pimp,
but you can't be pimping.

152
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,169
You wanna be a pimp,
then you gotta learn the game.

153
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,713
It's all about knowing the game.

154
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,131
What's the game?

155
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,552
The game is how you treat the bitches.
Bitch gotta know when she out there,

156
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,430
she making your motherfucking money,
know what I'm saying?

157
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:18,391
You got your main bitch.

158
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,518
That be your bottom bitch.

159
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,104
That bitch rank higher
than all the other bitches,

160
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,314
but she still a bitch,
know what I'm saying?

161
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,858
I know what you are saying.
You don't have to keep asking.

162
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,820
See, it's all about mind control.
You got to act the part.

163
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,613
Any man can control a bitch's heart,

164
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,741
but a pimp gotta control a bitch's mind,
know what I'm saying?

165
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,368
I know what you're saying.

166
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,955
Pimp gotta be out there everyday
keeping his bitches in line.

167
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,708
Can't let em go shopping,
spending their money on stupid shit.

168
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,375
Bitch got to think that's your money,
know what I'm saying?

169
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,130
I believe I know
what you are saying!

170
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,218
- There you are, Butters.
- Hey, dad!

171
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,762
Butters, we heard a rumor that...

172
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,555
you might have a little girlfriend.
Sally Darson?

173
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,475
I got lots of girlfriends.

174
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,477
Sally is just my bottom bitch!

175
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,023
Do you know what I am saying?

176
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,656
I've got to tell you,

177
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,908
I don't do
this kind of thing very often.

178
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,744
You're sure you're not a cop, right?

179
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,788
No way!
Let's just get to this, baby.

180
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,081
All right.

181
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,460
<i>You are agreeing to have sex with me</i>

182
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,628
<i>for $100, correct?</i>

183
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,422
<i>Sure.
I have the money.</i>

184
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,300
Remember he's going to give us
the code word to move in.

185
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,343
Wait for the code word "Stretch".

186
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,761
Code word is "Stretch".
Copy.

187
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,558
- Get those pants down.
- You feel good.

188
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,186
You're a nasty little fucker.

189
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:47,688
Let me see that hot penis of yours.

190
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,440
Nice.

191
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,609
I'm ready when you are.

192
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,653
- That's great.
- You like it?

193
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,947
- I love it!
- You're a dirty fucker.

194
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,283
<i>Come on, harder!
Deeper!</i>

195
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,536
<i>Teach me a lesson, daddy!</i>

196
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,872
<i>Teach this little whore a lesson!</i>

197
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:06,832
<i>Yeah, that's right!</i>

198
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,630
Oh, man!

199
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,760
Thank you.
That was great.

200
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,346
You've really worked it, daddy.

201
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,848
You really gave
my little hole quite a...

202
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:23,974
stretch!

203
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,310
That's it.
Move in!

204
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,607
Oh, God!
It's the police!

205
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,733
Freeze!

206
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,613
You are under arrest
for soliciting prostitution!

207
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,490
- Book him, boys!
- Please!

208
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,159
Please, don't do this.
I have a wife and kids!

209
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,661
A wife and kids.

210
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,497
And you're out here
trolling the streets for prostitutes?

211
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,999
You make me sick.
Take him downtown, boys.

212
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,709
I'm going back on the street.

213
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:59,093
That's it!
Recess is over, back to class!

214
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,014
Boy, oh, boy.
Really great work bitches!

215
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,059
You all sold lots of kisses today!
Except for you Meagan.

216
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,812
I'm afraid you get
a stormy cloud sticker today.

217
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,565
So wait.
You're keeping all the money now?

218
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:16,318
I just hold on to all the money.
Bitches can't be trusted with it.

219
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:18,654
We pool all
the kissing money together, see?

220
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,238
If you want to buy anything,
just talk to the bottom bitch,

221
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,200
and then
the bottom bitch talks to me.

222
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,911
See you after school,
do you know what I am saying?

223
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,498
Children I want you all
to copy down these math problems,

224
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,458
and solve them before recess.

225
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,547
What?

226
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,966
Bitch, you wanna make
some motherfucking money?

227
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:39,967
What?

228
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,136
You should be
doing kisses on the playground.

229
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,054
You can make fifty bucks a day.

230
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,391
Buy all the stuff you've ever wanted.
I'll treat you right, bitch.

231
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,517
Shut up!

232
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,477
All right, then.

233
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:57,776
Don't you wanna start
making some real fucking money?

234
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,571
- Leave me alone.
- You were made for the playground.

235
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,032
You should be working.
Don't you want a new lunchbox?

236
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,282
Nice new coat?
I can get all that for you, bitch.

237
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,952
Butters!
Dude!

238
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,246
- What?
- You can't call my girlfriend a bitch!

239
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,082
I'm just saying
the bitch should be working.

240
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,502
What you doing,
giving kisses to Stan for free?

241
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,670
You should be making
some motherfucking money.

242
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,588
If you don't stop this,
I'll kick your ass.

243
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,801
Clyde, here's a hundred bucks.
If Stan comes near me, punch him.

244
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,636
We've created a monster.

245
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,806
You should be putting
that mouth to work.

246
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,307
Butters?
Do you have a problem?

247
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,144
All these bitches
are kissing fellers

248
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,481
and they haven't figured out
they can make some serious money.

249
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,444
Really glad
you joined the company, Annie!

250
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:44,448
Now remember, you're charging
$5 for a kiss, two for a hug,

251
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,784
and six for half and half.
All right, bitch?

252
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,577
All right, how about a freebie?

253
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,376
- Butters, we should talk.
- Sure, Kyle!

254
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,504
Can't you see this is wrong?
You've got little boys

255
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,673
spending all
their lunch money on kisses.

256
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,425
Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses.
It's wrong.

257
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,137
Kyle, every boy pays for kisses.
Do you know what I am saying?

258
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,474
If you got a girl, and she kisses you,
sooner or later you're paying for it.

259
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,977
You gotta take her out to lunch,
take her to a movie

260
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,060
and listen
to all her stupid problems.

261
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,520
Look at Stan.

262
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:20,484
He's gotta listen to her stupid problems
because she kisses him.

263
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,571
You ask me, that's a lot more
than the $5 my company charges.

264
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,992
- Butters, what's happened to you?
- What happened is I became a man.

265
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,077
I'm sorry I'm not
your little buddy anymore.

266
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,870
There's a time
people have to grow up!

267
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,624
Do you know what I am saying?

268
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,377
Alpha Tau Omega!

269
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,339
ATOs!

270
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,301
All right, ATOs!

271
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,594
Our little Kevin is 21 today!

272
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,390
And so Kevin,

273
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,767
we would like
to welcome you to manhood,

274
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:55,394
our gift to you.

275
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,253
Give it to me!

276
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,505
Come on, you sissies.
I can fit more of you!

277
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,761
You like your stripper whore?
You like her?

278
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,847
Freeze!

279
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,353
Take them all to the station.

280
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,022
For oral and anal sex
with a prostitute.

281
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,982
Half of them didn't even use
a condom!

282
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,651
Don't you stupid kids know
the diseases you can catch?

283
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,653
Hand me that evidence bag!

284
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:55,829
Sir, some of us are wondering
if maybe you're not...

285
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,956
taking this role a bit far.

286
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,500
What?
No way.

287
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,920
Nothing is more important than keeping
prostitution out of our community!

288
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,838
Hold on, that's my daddy.

289
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,257
- Hey, daddy.
- Where you at, bitch?

290
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,924
I need my bottom bitch right now.

291
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,801
Yes, daddy, I'm on my way.

292
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,721
I made you my bottom bitch,

293
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,347
now you gotta take care of your pimp,
know what I'm saying?

294
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,558
Be right there.

295
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,103
Sorry, guys.
My daddy needs me right now.

296
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,943
Damn, bitch.

297
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,195
Your pimp beat your ass again?

298
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,947
He's an asshole.

299
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,200
I heard a rumor
about a new pimp up in Park County.

300
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,993
They say he's real respectful.

301
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,121
Lots a girls
are switching over to him.

302
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,332
A pimp that respects his hos?
Sign my ass up.

303
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,420
And that's $3,000 today for Sharise!

304
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,589
- Did I do good, daddy?
- Really great work, bitch.

305
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:51,009
That is another
sunshine sticker for you.

306
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,428
Thank you, daddy!

307
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,310
I would like to see

308
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,021
if there are any housing loan
opportunities for my employees,

309
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,564
and also what corporate tax
I should be filing under.

310
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,528
And exactly what kind of business
are you running?

311
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,488
It's a kissing company!

312
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,408
- And you're making a profit?
- Sure.

313
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,243
My black employee Sharise,

314
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,621
one time she made $2,000
on one customer!

315
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:22,916
Can you believe it?
$2,000 just to kiss a feller!

316
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,670
She currently stays in a motel room.
A lot of her customers see her late.

317
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:29,590
You wouldn't believe the time of night
some guys want a kiss.

318
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,175
Do you keep any record
of the men getting these "kisses"?

319
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,638
Of course, my bottom bitch
keeps a database of all our customers.

320
00:17:36,763 --> 00:17:39,306
Specially the VIPs,
like senator Morris.

321
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,186
- Senator Morris?
- Sure!

322
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,897
Senator Morris gets kisses
every day at lunch time.

323
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,815
You know where he likes
to get kissed?

324
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,693
- Where?
- In a motel room.

325
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,528
Darndest thing.
He must get sleepy.

326
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,320
All right.
Get out of here!

327
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,949
- Why?
- I'm not falling for it!

328
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,326
But I heard ACORN
helps pimps and their bitches.

329
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,454
We aren't giving you anything.
Get out!

330
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,539
Mrs. Davis, is there
some kind of problem?

331
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,125
- No, sir.
- Mr. Daniels!

332
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,086
You get kisses from my bitch Roxie
in the ally behind Sizzler!

333
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,425
Boy!
How do you like that bitches!

334
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,762
Approval for two housing loans
and tax exempt status!

335
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,138
File these away, Sally!

336
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,934
Daddy, how come this ho
get to be bottom bitch?

337
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,519
- What?
- I make the most money for you.

338
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,062
That means if anyone
should be bottom bitch, it's me.

339
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,858
- Screw off, ho!
- Fair is fair, ho!

340
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,985
Well, well.
Bitches! Bitches!

341
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,611
Excuse me!

342
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,158
This must be the organization

343
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,325
I've been hearing so much about.

344
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,746
It took me a long time to find you.

345
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,667
You won't believe the hardships
I've been through to track you down.

346
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,252
My name is Yolanda.

347
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,380
I'd like to know
all about your operation here.

348
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:55,215
You see, I just left my pimp recently
and I'm looking for a new one.

349
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,470
We operate at a 60/40 split here.

350
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,765
Bitches have access to Medicare
and now low income housing loans.

351
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,936
I think that's about
all I need to hear.

352
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,106
What's that?

353
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,236
Yolanda, please!

354
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,280
You gotta come back to me!

355
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,530
I got nothing without you!

356
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,785
You gotta a lot of nerve
coming here, Keshawn!

357
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,453
After the way you treated me!

358
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,413
I need a pimp that doesn't beat me
every time he gets drunk!

359
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,376
I love you!

360
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,086
I need you.

361
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,297
Not as my bottom bitch.
I want...

362
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,799
I want to marry you.

363
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,595
It's too late for that, Keshawn!

364
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,265
I just told this pimp
I was his bitch now!

365
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:44,766
Hold on, now!

366
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,311
I'd never get in the way
of somebody being happy.

367
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,480
Us pimps gotta be good,
even to each other.

368
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,400
Thanks, pimp.

369
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,028
You done changed the game,
that's what you did.

370
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,487
Marry me!

371
00:19:57,612 --> 00:20:00,490
We'll move to a little chateau
in Switzerland, get away from all this!

372
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,960
I love you so much.

373
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,171
- Babe, I love you too.
- So much, baby.

374
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,256
Let's just be happy, okay?

375
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,425
- Promise, baby?
- Promise.

376
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:23,930
Geez.

377
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,272
Gals, could you all
come gather around?

378
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,982
Gather around, gals, take a knee.

379
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,570
Gals, I'm afraid
I can't do this anymore.

380
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,572
I'm going to be leaving the company.

381
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,492
I enjoyed being your pimp and all.
It's just that...

382
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,369
When I see real love,

383
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,704
like what those two people have,

384
00:20:47,954 --> 00:20:49,623
it just makes me feel like...

385
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:51,039
like a dick.

386
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,335
I may be a man now,

387
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,505
but it doesn't mean I have the right
to be earning money for what girls do.

388
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,673
Whether you charge fellers
for kisses by cash

389
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,259
or by making them listening
to your stupid problems,

390
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,719
that's your hard work.

391
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,514
Bitches, this is your company now.

392
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,807
So get out there

393
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,476
and make yourself
some motherfucking money!

394
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,368
Happy anniversary, baby!

395
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,620
- Do you like them?
- I love them, darling.

396
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,079
I wanted to get you something
extra special.

397
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,374
Hold on.

398
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,418
I got something
for you too, my love.

399
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:36,461
I just put it over here by the...

400
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:37,796
Freeze!

401
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,007
You're busted, buddy.
I'm cop!
