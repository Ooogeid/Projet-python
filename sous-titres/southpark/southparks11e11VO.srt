00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,009
<i>I'm going out to South Park
gonna have myself a time</i>

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,415
<i>Friendly faces everywhere
humble folks without temptation</i>

5
00:00:14,446 --> 00:00:17,762
<i>I'm goin out to south park
gonna leave my woes behind</i>

6
00:00:17,793 --> 00:00:21,022
<i>Ample parking day or night
people spouting howdy neighbor</i>

7
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:24,263
<i>I'm heading out to south park
to see if i cant unwind</i>

8
00:00:24,294 --> 00:00:27,615
<i>I like girls with big fat titties
really big fat titties</i>

9
00:00:27,646 --> 00:00:31,121
<i>So come on out to south park
and meet some friends of mine</i>

10
00:00:32,507 --> 00:00:35,290
<i>Previously on Battlestar Galactica...</i>

11
00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:39,556
What is this place?
- This is Imaginationland.

12
00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:41,885
Allah!

13
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:46,257
We have to get out of here!
- Hold on, fellas!

14
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:47,803
Butters!

15
00:00:48,126 --> 00:00:52,281
Terrorists have just attacked...
our imagination.

16
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,400
If the terrorists blow that barrier,

17
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:57,822
all the most evil things ever imagined
are gonna pour out!

18
00:00:57,846 --> 00:01:00,391
Allah!
- No!

19
00:01:03,145 --> 00:01:06,061
Episode II

20
00:01:10,755 --> 00:01:13,511
<i>Butters, time for breakfast.</i>

21
00:01:15,487 --> 00:01:18,270
Oh jeez, it was just a dream.

22
00:01:18,307 --> 00:01:21,490
Come on, Butters. Mom's cooked
waffles and nanas for you.

23
00:01:21,526 --> 00:01:26,510
Mom, Dad, I dreamt I was in Imaginationland
and terrorists attacked it.

24
00:01:26,538 --> 00:01:30,372
You are in Imaginationland.
This is a dream.

25
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:35,083
Hey, wake up, stupid!
Come on, wake up, kid!

26
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:41,171
No, wait! I was back home in bed!
- No! You passed out and peed your pants!

27
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:44,853
Look! The evil of Imaginationland
is coming out!

28
00:01:59,857 --> 00:02:01,792
Oh hamburgers!

29
00:02:04,617 --> 00:02:08,012
Everyone! Fall back to the Gumdrop Forest!

30
00:02:08,058 --> 00:02:11,523
Come with me, little boy!
I'm going to get you home!

31
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:14,250
It's Alien!

32
00:02:19,628 --> 00:02:21,090
Predator!

33
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:35,240
Look, we already told you everything we know.

34
00:02:35,248 --> 00:02:38,300
Some guy just showed up in a big balloon
and took us into Imaginationland.

35
00:02:38,328 --> 00:02:40,262
What we want to know is how!

36
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:44,900
We need to find a way into Imaginationland,
you've been there! How did you do it?!

37
00:02:44,926 --> 00:02:47,302
We just went on a balloon ride.

38
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:49,911
There must have been some kind
of portal or doorway.

39
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:51,252
Dude, we don't remember.

40
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:53,243
Do you realize what's going on here?!

41
00:02:53,248 --> 00:02:58,322
Terrorists have attacked our imagination
and now our imaginations are running wild!

42
00:02:58,357 --> 00:03:02,643
You'd better start remembering!
- It was the Chinese, wasn't it?

43
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:03,800
What?

44
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,571
We've suspected that the Chinese government
was working on a doorway to the imagination.

45
00:03:07,577 --> 00:03:09,723
Is that where you were?!
- No.

46
00:03:09,737 --> 00:03:13,331
That's it, isn't it?! Where do the Chinese
keep this portal? How does it work?

47
00:03:13,355 --> 00:03:16,552
It it better than ours?
- Your what?

48
00:03:16,588 --> 00:03:21,170
Our portal to the imagination built as a secret
project back in 1962 to fight the Soviets-

49
00:03:21,188 --> 00:03:25,830
Tom! That's super-secret.
- Oh, I'm sorry sir.

50
00:03:26,687 --> 00:03:29,921
Wait. The U.S. Government has
a portal to the imagination?

51
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:34,421
Aw, see? Good job, Tom! Why don't you
just tell them everything about Project X?!

52
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,683
Yes sir. We built a portal to the imagination

53
00:03:36,688 --> 00:03:39,250
to use against the Russians durin
the Cold War, but we never got a-

54
00:03:39,258 --> 00:03:42,780
That was sarcasm. I was
being sarcastic, you fucking idiot?!

55
00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:44,582
Aw jeez, I'm really sorry sir.

56
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:47,750
If you already built a doorway to
the imagination, then why do you need us?

57
00:03:47,798 --> 00:03:51,441
All right, we might as well show it to them.
Goddamnit, Tom.

58
00:03:52,705 --> 00:03:55,361
<i>Every night, the dream is the same</i>

59
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:58,641
<i>I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle</i>

60
00:03:58,676 --> 00:04:01,600
<i>because we had a bet that if I could
prove leprechauns were real</i>

61
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:03,781
<i>he would suck my balls</i>

62
00:04:03,955 --> 00:04:06,600
<i>And it turns out I was right</i>

63
00:04:07,395 --> 00:04:10,123
Time to pay up, Kyle.

64
00:04:11,105 --> 00:04:12,912
<i>But then...</i>

65
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:16,491
No!

66
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:19,580
No!

67
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:23,630
<i>It's been taken from me
I have dry balls</i>

68
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:27,242
<i>Balls so dry they explode like dust</i>

69
00:04:32,677 --> 00:04:37,143
You okay, kid?
- No. I've got dry balls.

70
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:39,143
And I'm running out of time.

71
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:56,781
Ever since the Cold War, the U.S. Government
has been working on a secret project...

72
00:04:56,785 --> 00:05:03,631
to build a doorway into the imagination.
It is called "Project Imagination Doorway."

73
00:05:05,158 --> 00:05:07,143
That's not very imaginative.

74
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:14,382
According to all the tests and the data,
the doorway should work, but it never has.

75
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:16,902
But we're close, sir. We're real close.

76
00:05:16,937 --> 00:05:19,131
They've been saying that for
over forty years.

77
00:05:19,136 --> 00:05:22,820
You're the ones, right? The kids
who have been in the imagination.

78
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,811
Ah, I guess.
- What was the sequence that got you inside?

79
00:05:25,846 --> 00:05:29,041
We know there's some kind of resonance code,
but we can't figure it out.

80
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:31,492
Look, we're sorry, you guys,
but the balloon just went up in the air

81
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,892
and the dude sang a song
and we were suddenly there.

82
00:05:33,928 --> 00:05:36,380
Song? You didn't say anything
about a song before.

83
00:05:36,426 --> 00:05:39,413
What song?
- The Imagination song?

84
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:40,622
That could be it.

85
00:05:40,635 --> 00:05:43,951
The fractal converter has never worked,
because it was waiting for a multitonal code!

86
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:46,793
Quick boys, how does the Imagination Song go?

87
00:05:48,176 --> 00:05:51,522
Imagination.

88
00:05:51,557 --> 00:05:54,481
Imagination.

89
00:05:54,515 --> 00:05:56,963
Sir, I'm getting some electrofeedback
from the gate.

90
00:05:56,965 --> 00:06:00,091
It's weak, but it's nanoresponding
to something.

91
00:06:00,117 --> 00:06:03,921
Was there more to the Imagination Song?
How does the rest of it go?

92
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:07,832
Imagination.

93
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:11,671
No, no dude, it went up there.

94
00:06:14,747 --> 00:06:16,951
Dude, we don't remember.
It was really long and stupid.

95
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:20,172
I'm just about through playing with you boys!
We're running out of time!

96
00:06:20,178 --> 00:06:24,003
You have to remember that song
in its entirety!

97
00:06:27,996 --> 00:06:30,392
Mayor, what are we supposed to do?

98
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:33,652
Please, sir. I have to get home to my world.

99
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:39,403
Oh, well. All you have to do is tap
your heels together three times.

100
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:43,922
Really?
- No, you fucking dipshit, that was a joke!

101
00:06:45,397 --> 00:06:48,422
Mayor, what are we supposed to do,
snarf snarf?

102
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:53,382
Get to Castle Sunshine! It's your only hope!
- Castle Sunshine?

103
00:06:53,418 --> 00:06:58,152
Through the Gumdrop Forest.
Others will be hiding there. Go, run!

104
00:06:58,186 --> 00:07:03,392
Look out for the evil characters!
They're assembling on the Yum Yum mountain!

105
00:07:05,085 --> 00:07:09,661
We are free!
Now all of Imaginationland is ours!

106
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:15,812
Not all, foolish orc! There are still parts
of Imaginationland we don't comtrol.

107
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:20,071
Tomorrow, we shall build our
own castle right on this spot!

108
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:25,443
Who put you in charge, Krueger?!
I am the most evil character here!

109
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:28,780
Nonsense!
Your evil is stale.

110
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:32,572
I am the most evil imaginary character!

111
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:38,293
Now come on y'all. We shouldn't be fighting,
we're supposed to all be on the same side.

112
00:07:38,328 --> 00:07:40,911
Yeah. You're all right, Squirrelly Squirrel.

113
00:07:40,947 --> 00:07:42,990
Yeah!

114
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:45,800
What evil imaginary characters are they?

115
00:07:45,817 --> 00:07:50,021
They were dreamt up by some fourth grade
kid as part of his Christmas Story.

116
00:07:50,055 --> 00:07:54,040
Now come on y'all. We can't waste time arguing,
there could still be survivors out there.

117
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:57,433
We need to hunt them down and kill them.
- And eat their flesh!

118
00:07:57,468 --> 00:08:01,313
But first we should rape them!
- How about we kill them.

119
00:08:01,408 --> 00:08:05,490
And then rape their bodies so we
can use their blood as lubricant?

120
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:08,442
Say, that's a great idea, Beary Bear.

121
00:08:11,627 --> 00:08:15,591
Man, I do not want to meet the kid
that dreamt those things up.

122
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:19,481
Look, I want some goddamn answers!
You brought my friend here to Washington!

123
00:08:19,485 --> 00:08:21,330
Where is he?! What is going on?!

124
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:24,042
I'm sorry, sir.
That information is classified.

125
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,811
Something is going on and I have
a right to know where my friend is!

126
00:08:26,826 --> 00:08:29,600
There's somebody asking a lot of
questions about what's going on.

127
00:08:29,638 --> 00:08:30,952
Let me handle this!

128
00:08:30,987 --> 00:08:36,393
I'm sorry, but there is no such thing
as Project Imagination Doorway!

129
00:08:36,738 --> 00:08:38,171
Imagination Doorway.

130
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:42,291
It was started in the Sixties as
a secret government project. Right.

131
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:45,723
Imagination...

132
00:08:45,757 --> 00:08:49,382
Wait, maybe that's where he went really
flat, like that half-step key change?

133
00:08:49,415 --> 00:08:51,382
Imagination.

134
00:08:51,418 --> 00:08:54,251
Right, then it was:
Imagination...

135
00:08:54,256 --> 00:08:55,671
Imagination...

136
00:08:55,676 --> 00:08:58,131
Imagination...

137
00:09:02,556 --> 00:09:05,030
It's open! It's open!

138
00:09:05,068 --> 00:09:08,401
Getting readings from the other side,
that's it.

139
00:09:08,438 --> 00:09:11,293
We've made an opening to
our imagination, sir!

140
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:17,771
All right, that's enough! We've still
got a lot of work to do, people!

141
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:23,561
It's time to go in and get our
imaginations under control!

142
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:28,881
How much further to Castle Sunshine?

143
00:09:28,926 --> 00:09:33,190
Snarf, I'm not sure, snarf snarf.
I've never been.

144
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,086
What was that?
- Over here.

145
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:41,435
Oh Christ. It's Strawberry Shortcake.

146
00:09:44,136 --> 00:09:46,357
Please, let me go.

147
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:55,101
Oh my God! Snarf.

148
00:09:57,956 --> 00:09:59,933
Now kill her!

149
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:03,862
Hang on, y'all. You can't just kill her.
That's not evil enough.

150
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:07,751
What do you mean? We cut out her eyeball.
- Yeah, that's super hardcore.

151
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:10,083
Now come on y'all.
We can do better than that.

152
00:10:10,117 --> 00:10:13,691
Hey! I know! Let's all pee in
her empty eye socket!

153
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:17,131
Let's make her eat her own eyeball
and then pee in her empty eyesocket.

154
00:10:17,168 --> 00:10:23,001
How about we get someone with AIDS to pee
in her eyesocket, so she dies all slowlike?

155
00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:27,293
Nobody here has AIDS!

156
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:32,323
But we've got to have AIDS before
we pee in her eyesocket!

157
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:35,792
Now don't be down y'all. I bet we can
find some AIDS out in the forest.

158
00:10:38,307 --> 00:10:40,560
Dude, run, run, run!

159
00:10:48,135 --> 00:10:52,370
All right, men. We don't know what you'll
experience on the other side of this doorway,

160
00:10:52,406 --> 00:10:55,231
but it will most likely be really weird.

161
00:10:55,267 --> 00:11:00,260
If you reach our imagination, you are to take
every step necessary to get it under control!

162
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,802
Are you ready?
- Yes sir!

163
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:03,911
Are you ready, Kurt Russell?

164
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:07,703
I don't understand why I'm here.
I'm just an actor.

165
00:11:07,737 --> 00:11:10,281
Yes, but you were in that one movie
that was kinda like this.

166
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:15,781
That gives you more experience than anybody.
All right, here we go! Men! Forward!

167
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:17,962
Sir, we have a security breach!
- What?!

168
00:11:17,997 --> 00:11:21,081
There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert!
It's coming from Sector Two!

169
00:11:21,118 --> 00:11:23,540
Sector Two?

170
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:27,321
Cartman?

171
00:11:28,328 --> 00:11:31,453
Hello Kyle! Thought you could get
out of your responsibilities, huh?!

172
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:32,572
Who the hell are you?!

173
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:35,753
That kid you have made a bit that if
I could prove that I saw a leprechaun,

174
00:11:35,757 --> 00:11:37,143
he would suck my balls!

175
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:38,812
Get him out of here!

176
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:43,731
No! Hold on a second! I have a contract
validatd by the United States court system!

177
00:11:43,765 --> 00:11:45,583
Let me see that!

178
00:11:48,356 --> 00:11:51,352
Why would you agree to suck someone's balls?

179
00:11:51,386 --> 00:11:53,650
I didn't think there was going to
be a goddamned leprechaun!

180
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:57,350
All right, you two can go use the conference
room. Go on, we have work to do here.

181
00:11:57,386 --> 00:11:59,670
Well wait, I wanna see what happens here!

182
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:03,680
You signed an agreement, kid. We don't
have time for this. Go on and do it.

183
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:07,670
Stan?
- Dude, you did make a deal.

184
00:12:10,148 --> 00:12:12,762
The conference room is which way?

185
00:12:13,597 --> 00:12:18,901
Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail
out on our agreement, but I found you.

186
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:22,101
I didn't bail, I got picked up by
the governmemt!

187
00:12:22,138 --> 00:12:25,100
Well we're here now, that's all that matters.

188
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:30,230
Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess
you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.

189
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:32,170
Cartman, do you even know what's going on?

190
00:12:32,175 --> 00:12:34,751
We went to Imaginationland,
terrorists attacked it

191
00:12:34,757 --> 00:12:37,681
and now the government is about to-

192
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:41,752
Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle. It's just that
I'm so completely bored by this story.

193
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:44,021
See, I'm really only interested in
the part where the leprechaun was real,

194
00:12:44,036 --> 00:12:46,520
and so you have to suck my balls.

195
00:12:46,556 --> 00:12:49,033
Okay, fine. You know what?
Let's just get it over with!

196
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,572
Oh no, not so fast, Kyle.

197
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:56,262
I've waited a long time for this and I
intend to savor each and every second.

198
00:12:56,298 --> 00:12:59,613
No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's
happening downstairs, so let's just do it!

199
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:03,442
Not just yet, Kyle. There's still
a few things I need to do.

200
00:13:03,477 --> 00:13:06,983
By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had
a chance to shower while making my way up here.

201
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:09,903
My balls are extra vinegary.

202
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:12,243
Just get to it already!

203
00:13:14,546 --> 00:13:16,952
Entering the portal in five seconds.

204
00:13:16,988 --> 00:13:21,462
Kurt Russell, can I get a comm check?
- Check 1, 2.

205
00:13:21,498 --> 00:13:24,430
Good luck men! Godspeed!

206
00:13:42,105 --> 00:13:45,703
What do we have?!
Kurt Russell, can you hear me?

207
00:13:45,806 --> 00:13:48,812
<i>We're here. We're somewhere.</i>

208
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:52,643
They are inside the imagination, sir.
- What do you see in there?

209
00:13:52,675 --> 00:13:58,643
<i>There's lots of big mushrooms, colorful
grass, some castles in the distance.</i>

210
00:13:58,677 --> 00:14:02,471
<i>Wait. Something's coming for us!</i>

211
00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:05,710
<i>It's coming out of the bushes and-</i>

212
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:13,132
<i>Oh, it's just a cute little squirrel.
Hey, it talks. The little squirrel talks.</i>

213
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:17,053
Aw, an imaginary talking squirrel.

214
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,992
Ask the squirrel what it knows about
the terrorist attack.

215
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:25,923
<i>Wait a minute. The squirrel has friends.
Why it's a whold bunch of Woodland ritters.</i>

216
00:14:25,957 --> 00:14:27,552
Wait, Woodland critters?

217
00:14:27,558 --> 00:14:30,183
<i>There's a talking bear and a beaver.</i>

218
00:14:30,215 --> 00:14:35,002
<i>They seem to be Christmas critters.
Well hello. Yes, hi.</i>

219
00:14:35,047 --> 00:14:36,591
Get them out of there!
- What?

220
00:14:36,617 --> 00:14:40,262
Tell them to get away now!
- What's the matter?

221
00:14:40,368 --> 00:14:43,211
<i>The cute little bear's eyes are starting
to glow red now.</i>

222
00:14:43,255 --> 00:14:46,810
<i>Hello there, little animals, do you
happen to know how to huh?</i>

223
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:51,242
Kurt Russell, what's going on?!

224
00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:55,861
<i>They're raping me! They're raping me!</i>

225
00:14:55,898 --> 00:14:57,563
Get out of there, Kurt Russell!

226
00:14:57,565 --> 00:15:01,953
<i>They're raping all of us! Oh, it hurts!</i>

227
00:15:01,997 --> 00:15:05,563
<i>They're raping us and it hurts!</i>

228
00:15:09,156 --> 00:15:12,553
I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter
with a low depth of field. What do you think?

229
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:15,821
Goddamnit Cartman, will you stop
wasting time? I wanna get this over with!

230
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:16,933
No, you're right, Kyle.

231
00:15:16,936 --> 00:15:19,602
A higher depth of field will make
sure everything stays in focus.

232
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:21,043
There we go.

233
00:15:22,676 --> 00:15:25,122
Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls,

234
00:15:25,127 --> 00:15:27,602
are you gonna think about how right
I was about the leprechaun?

235
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:31,140
Or are you just gonna try and focus on how
rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?

236
00:15:31,178 --> 00:15:32,892
Let's just do it!

237
00:15:32,926 --> 00:15:36,062
In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager
for balls, aren't you?

238
00:15:36,088 --> 00:15:38,120
Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving?

239
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:40,761
You see, Kyle, I wonder if at
this moment you are actually-

240
00:15:42,017 --> 00:15:46,100
Everyone to the main hall now! Go!
- No, we're not done in here yet.

241
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:50,792
Everyone to the main hall now!
- No! Goddamnit, no!

242
00:15:53,307 --> 00:15:57,362
Boy snarf snarf, my feet
are really getting tired snarf.

243
00:15:57,397 --> 00:16:00,711
Aw, Snarf, could you maybe
like shut up for five minutes?

244
00:16:00,745 --> 00:16:03,460
Wait! There it is. We made it!

245
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,513
Castle Sunshine!

246
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,572
Yeah!

247
00:16:09,618 --> 00:16:10,913
Hurry! Get inside!

248
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:13,263
The evil imaginary characters
are approaching!

249
00:16:13,268 --> 00:16:15,763
Lock down the gates!
Prepare to fire the cannons!

250
00:16:15,796 --> 00:16:18,140
Wait! Wait!

251
00:16:18,668 --> 00:16:23,472
What imaginary character are you?!
- The Lollipop King? From the Lollipop Forest?

252
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:27,093
And I'm Snarf. Snarf, snarf snarf snarf.

253
00:16:27,128 --> 00:16:32,910
And what imaginary character are you?
- I'm not imaginary. I'm Butters.

254
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:34,112
What's a "Butters"?

255
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,961
The Mayor brought him and some
other kids into Imaginationland...

256
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:38,791
just before the terrorist attack.

257
00:16:38,825 --> 00:16:42,832
So you came from the real world at
precisely the same time as the terrorists!

258
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:45,330
That seems like quite a coincidence!

259
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:48,482
Well I was just playing with my friends
and then we caught a leprechaun

260
00:16:48,485 --> 00:16:51,392
and then this guy-
- You caught the leprechaun? Take him!

261
00:16:51,426 --> 00:16:54,292
Perseus! He's not against us, snarf snarf!

262
00:16:58,088 --> 00:17:00,662
Talk to me! What's going on?!

263
00:17:00,698 --> 00:17:04,522
Something is coming through
the gate from the other side.

264
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:13,781
What is it?!
- It's like a half man half bear!

265
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:15,823
And half pig!

266
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:22,151
Oh! No, no wait!
It's like a half bear, half manpig!

267
00:17:23,617 --> 00:17:25,250
Look out!

268
00:17:25,557 --> 00:17:30,251
No! I think it's more like a half man
and half pigbear!

269
00:17:30,286 --> 00:17:33,281
Reverse the doorway!
Send it back through!

270
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:37,350
Kyle!

271
00:17:58,016 --> 00:18:01,913
Please! I didn't help the terrorists
get into Imaginationland! Honest!

272
00:18:01,945 --> 00:18:04,511
That is for the Council of Nine to decide!

273
00:18:04,545 --> 00:18:06,991
Don't worry, kid,
the Council of Nine consists of some

274
00:18:06,997 --> 00:18:11,891
of the most highly-regarded imaginary
characters in all Imaginationland.

275
00:18:12,086 --> 00:18:15,272
Fellow Council, these are indeed dark times.

276
00:18:15,305 --> 00:18:20,930
The evil forces amass at our gates as we
speak. Zeus believes we should evacuate.

277
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:26,083
Yes. Their power outmatches ours. If they are
giving us a chance to leave we must take it!

278
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:28,372
And what say you, Morpheus?

279
00:18:28,418 --> 00:18:32,680
How our we to know that they will let
us go? Their offer could be a trap.

280
00:18:32,717 --> 00:18:37,380
Perhaps we must flee to the Temple of Alderon.
Surely they wouldn't chase us there.

281
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,771
No, we can't. Come on, you guys,
this is our home.

282
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:44,093
We have to fight, to keep it the way
it was meant to be.

283
00:18:44,138 --> 00:18:47,542
I'm with Jesus. The evil characters
aren't going to just us go.

284
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:54,781
That may be, Popeye,
but we don't have a choice!

285
00:18:55,897 --> 00:19:01,113
Forgive my intrusion, Council of Nine, but
this boy has infiltrated from the real world.

286
00:19:01,457 --> 00:19:03,131
Bring him here!

287
00:19:06,095 --> 00:19:07,623
Clear!

288
00:19:12,556 --> 00:19:15,481
I'm sorry. He's gone.

289
00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:21,880
No! Kyle can't die.
- I'm sorry, young man.

290
00:19:23,615 --> 00:19:25,283
Kyle?

291
00:19:25,755 --> 00:19:30,741
Well at least now he doesn't have
to suck anyone's balls.

292
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:33,510
No!

293
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:36,103
No, he has a strong heart!
He wants to live!

294
00:19:36,136 --> 00:19:38,841
Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!

295
00:19:40,628 --> 00:19:42,671
He's gone, little boy.

296
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:45,193
Zap him again! Do it!
- Charging.

297
00:19:45,195 --> 00:19:46,423
Do it!

298
00:19:48,466 --> 00:19:50,983
Come on buddy.
- Clear.

299
00:19:54,305 --> 00:19:55,833
Get out of here!

300
00:19:59,258 --> 00:20:03,043
Godamnit Kyle, you never walked away
from anything in your life! Now fight!

301
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:06,563
Fight! Fight! Right now!

302
00:20:06,595 --> 00:20:10,290
Fight! Fight!

303
00:20:19,815 --> 00:20:21,700
Give him some air.

304
00:20:21,738 --> 00:20:24,261
There, easy. Breathe easy.

305
00:20:28,465 --> 00:20:33,082
I believe this child was brought into
Imaginationland for a reason.

306
00:20:33,116 --> 00:20:35,470
Perhaps the Mayor knew something we don't.

307
00:20:35,475 --> 00:20:38,893
What are you saying, Aslan? That if we
are to take back control, we might-?

308
00:20:38,897 --> 00:20:43,061
Yes. If we are to take back
control from the evil forces,

309
00:20:43,097 --> 00:20:45,843
this little boy might be the key.

310
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,463
Aw, I'm the key?

311
00:20:47,478 --> 00:20:50,532
Could I not be the key, Morpheus?
I don't wanna be the key.

312
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:52,833
If you ever wanna see your home
again, little boy,

313
00:20:52,846 --> 00:20:54,650
you'll have to rise to this challenge.

314
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,012
But I'm supposed to be at school right now.

315
00:20:57,017 --> 00:21:00,663
And instead I got Snarf and Popeye
and Luke Skywalker all pissed off.

316
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:03,591
It is a dark time for all of us, young boy.

317
00:21:03,606 --> 00:21:09,461
But know that if you believe in yourself,
everything will turn out all right.

318
00:21:15,896 --> 00:21:20,063
Sir? Are you sure about this?
- We have no choice.

319
00:21:20,105 --> 00:21:25,561
Terrorists have attacked us where we are
most vulnerable. There's no other option.

320
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:28,990
We have to nuke our imagination.

321
00:21:38,186 --> 00:21:39,940
Wake up, Kyle.

322
00:21:41,408 --> 00:21:43,403
<i>To be continued...</i>
