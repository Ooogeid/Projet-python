00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:07,423
Season 13 Episode 4
"Eat, Pray, Queef"

2
00:00:41,805 --> 00:00:43,647
Oh, man, I thought
that day would never end!

3
00:00:43,772 --> 00:00:45,934
Stan, you wanna maybe
study together after school?

4
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:48,589
- What? No way. Today's the day!
- What day?

5
00:00:48,938 --> 00:00:51,592
The day they're showing part two
of last week's <i>Terrance & Phillip</i> show!

6
00:00:51,897 --> 00:00:54,534
They're gonna finally reveal who
Phillip farted on to get out of jail!

7
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:56,256
Oh, God, that show is so dumb.

8
00:00:56,381 --> 00:00:58,790
Dumb? Phillip farted
in somebody's face super hard,

9
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:01,263
but you don't know who
until this week's episode!

10
00:01:01,388 --> 00:01:03,311
This has been
the longest week of my life!

11
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:06,710
Why do boys think farts are so funny?
They're juvenile and gross!

12
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:10,044
No, no, you're right, Bebe.
Farts totally aren't funny.

13
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,723
- Come on. We gotta go!
- We're gonna learn the shocking truth

14
00:01:17,848 --> 00:01:20,315
- of who Phillip farted on.
- Let's get to my house!

15
00:01:24,842 --> 00:01:26,492
God, they're so stupid.

16
00:01:27,965 --> 00:01:30,632
- Oh, boy!
- I've waited all week for this.

17
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,150
- That's my seat, Craig.
- Dude, I was here first.

18
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:35,890
It's my goddamn house.
Now get your bitch ass on the floor!

19
00:01:36,015 --> 00:01:37,015
It's on!

20
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:41,767
<i>You are watching the Canada Channel.
The only channel in Canada.</i>

21
00:01:42,098 --> 00:01:44,145
<i>Previously on </i>Terrance & Phillip...

22
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:47,982
<i>Terrance farted on the American
president, but Phillip took the heat.</i>

23
00:01:51,206 --> 00:01:52,356
It wasn't me!

24
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:59,910
<i>And now, the thrilling conclusion
of </i>Terrance and Philip: Blood Rage...

25
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:01,969
<i>will not be seen tonight.</i>

26
00:02:02,094 --> 00:02:04,749
<i>So that we may bring you
this </i>Queef Sisters<i> special!</i>

27
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:08,085
What?

28
00:02:08,884 --> 00:02:10,924
<i>Canada Channel presents
</i>The Queef Sisters.

29
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:12,318
<i>Katherine and Katie Queef.</i>

30
00:02:12,443 --> 00:02:15,395
<i>Two Toronto girls who love
shooting air out of their vaginas.</i>

31
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,595
<i>It's a </i>Queef Sisters<i> special
on Channel Canada.</i>

32
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:22,449
All right, Queef Sisters. It's time for
your yearly pap smear and vag exam.

33
00:02:22,574 --> 00:02:24,362
- All right, doctor.
- I'm ready, doctor.

34
00:02:24,487 --> 00:02:26,494
I'm just going to check for cysts.

35
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,985
What the fuck is this?

36
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,478
Now listen here!

37
00:02:34,603 --> 00:02:37,715
If you queef in my face
then I refuse to be your gynecologist.

38
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,692
I'm sorry, doctor.
I had air trapped in my vagina.

39
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:45,498
Just don't let it happen again.
Now, I'm just going to check for cysts.

40
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,760
Now stop it.
That isn't funny.

41
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:52,429
Babies come from there!

42
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:58,060
- That's it. No pap smear for you.
- But, doctor, what if I have cancer?

43
00:02:58,185 --> 00:03:00,971
You should have thought of that before
you queefed in my face three times.

44
00:03:01,968 --> 00:03:05,810
They aren't gonna show part two
of the <i>Terrance & Phillip</i> show?

45
00:03:06,157 --> 00:03:08,151
Doctor, my sister
is just being difficult.

46
00:03:08,276 --> 00:03:10,681
Maybe you could just
examine my cervix instead?

47
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:13,056
All right.
Let me check for cysts.

48
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,597
That does it, Queef Sisters.
I'm not your vaginal doctor anymore!

49
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:24,017
Katie, I do believe
we made the doctor angry.

50
00:03:24,142 --> 00:03:25,667
<i>I guess so, Katherine.</i>

51
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:28,542
Dude, what the hell
is this disgusting crap?

52
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:32,031
What the the hell
is this disgusting crap?

53
00:03:32,156 --> 00:03:33,212
<i>Queef Sisters</i>?

54
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:35,714
That's right. It's a hot new
Canadian show we're trying out.

55
00:03:36,123 --> 00:03:37,902
You replaced our show with this?

56
00:03:38,027 --> 00:03:40,363
But they aren't funny.
All they do is queef all the time.

57
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:41,428
That's sick!

58
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:43,472
You think farts are funny,
why not queefs?

59
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,590
- Because babies come from there!
- Look, guys.

60
00:03:46,715 --> 00:03:49,447
Women are starting to be on the driving
force behind the television audience.

61
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:51,042
Women empowerment and the get-go,

62
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:53,245
So we want to try to appeal
to the female sensibility.

63
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,901
Sorry, guys, but if you ask me,
your farts have gotten stale.

64
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:00,557
As a matter of fact,
I will not hold!

65
00:04:00,682 --> 00:04:02,682
I've been hold for 35 minutes!

66
00:04:02,988 --> 00:04:05,074
We want some goddamn answers,
that's what we want!

67
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,788
Why did you show that smut instead of
the <i>Terrance & Phillip</i> conclusion,

68
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:09,718
- you asshole!
- What's going on?

69
00:04:09,843 --> 00:04:11,517
We're complaining
to the Canada network,

70
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:13,258
they put something gross on TV.

71
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:15,674
You wanna tell me what's funny
about two women shooting air

72
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:17,873
from their vagina into a man's face?

73
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:20,850
See, some of us were eating
when you showed that!

74
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:24,403
- I threw up on my way home.
- Clyde threw up on his way home!

75
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:27,138
What makes you think you can put
that kind of filth on TV?

76
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,342
- You tell 'em, Cartman!
- What happened?

77
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:31,676
They didn't show part two
of <i>Terrance & Phillip</i>.

78
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:33,480
They replaced it
with <i>The Queef Sisters</i>.

79
00:04:34,017 --> 00:04:36,591
It was just 30 minutes
of two women queefing on people.

80
00:04:36,716 --> 00:04:39,194
What? So farts are hysterical
but queefs are gross?

81
00:04:39,482 --> 00:04:41,477
Little kids could have
been watching that!

82
00:04:41,602 --> 00:04:43,653
What kind of network are you
running there in Canada?

83
00:04:43,778 --> 00:04:45,534
Don't call me buddy.
I'm not your buddy!

84
00:04:46,109 --> 00:04:47,740
I can't believe they're this upset.

85
00:04:47,865 --> 00:04:50,265
- God, they're annoying.
- I don't even know what a queef is.

86
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,672
It's when a woman blows
air out her vag, Annie.

87
00:04:53,048 --> 00:04:56,183
That girl Samantha Dunskin, she can
make herself queef whenever she wants.

88
00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:59,048
- Really?
- Wait a minute. I've got an idea.

89
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:04,061
And to that end,
by resorting to filth and garbage,

90
00:05:04,186 --> 00:05:06,286
the Canada Channel has thusly...

91
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:08,839
- Robbed us of our innocence.
- Yes, that's good.

92
00:05:08,964 --> 00:05:11,964
"Robbed us of us innocence."

93
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:13,098
Hey guys.

94
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:15,064
- We have a little surprise for you.
- What?

95
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:42,007
Butters?

96
00:05:42,904 --> 00:05:45,154
Oh, my God.
Well, how is he doing?

97
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:47,139
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

98
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:50,590
OK, thank you
for telling me, Mr. Stotch.

99
00:05:50,715 --> 00:05:53,615
I'll spread the word.
Yeah, you take care. Bye.

100
00:05:55,724 --> 00:05:57,274
We need to cancel our plans, Sharon.

101
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,333
There's gonna be an emergency
all-parent meeting at the school.

102
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,508
- Why? What's happened?
- A girl at school, she...

103
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,440
queefed on one
of Stan's friends today.

104
00:06:08,886 --> 00:06:09,886
So?

105
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:17,609
Hey, pal.

106
00:06:18,341 --> 00:06:20,280
I heard about
what happened at school today.

107
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:22,105
You wanna talk about it?

108
00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:24,589
Butters was just sitting there, dad.

109
00:06:24,714 --> 00:06:27,470
- He didn't even know it was coming.
- I know, pal.

110
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,431
Sometimes bad things
happen to good people.

111
00:06:30,996 --> 00:06:32,740
But, you know,
Butters is still Butters.

112
00:06:32,865 --> 00:06:35,089
And he needs you guys right
now more than anybody.

113
00:06:35,214 --> 00:06:37,879
It was so gross, dad. What if
another girl at school tries to...

114
00:06:38,004 --> 00:06:40,904
We're getting all the parents together
and we're gonna take care of this, OK?

115
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:43,027
Nothing like this
will ever happen again.

116
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:46,321
M'kay, parents,
some of you have already heard,

117
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:48,968
but most of you have not, m'kay.

118
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:51,201
We've had a terrible
incident occur at the school.

119
00:06:52,082 --> 00:06:56,075
Apparently a young girl went up
to a young boy here at the school.

120
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:58,459
M'kay, and queefed in his face.

121
00:07:01,528 --> 00:07:03,797
- How did this happen?
- Where were the teachers?

122
00:07:04,153 --> 00:07:05,153
Wait a minute.

123
00:07:05,278 --> 00:07:08,084
Are you saying we're all here just
because a girl queefed on a boy?

124
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:10,596
- Just?
- We're here to find out why!

125
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,586
The question is
how do we send a message

126
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:15,401
to other girls in the school
so this doesn't happen again.

127
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:18,852
Hold on a minute.

128
00:07:18,977 --> 00:07:20,854
I think we're being
a little drastic here.

129
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:23,119
You know, I probably see
a boy in my office

130
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:25,402
once a week for farting on a girl.

131
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,241
What does that have
to do with anything?

132
00:07:36,343 --> 00:07:39,471
Our next guests have
really taken America by storm.

133
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:42,718
Their new hit show is being tuned in
by women all over the world.

134
00:07:42,843 --> 00:07:44,568
Please welcome the Queef Sisters.

135
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:49,499
- Hello, Regis!
- Hello, Kelly!

136
00:07:51,548 --> 00:07:52,548
So, gals.

137
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:56,102
- You seem to really like queefing.
- Well, Regis, it's like this.

138
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:59,640
We think that queefing is a perfectly
normal female bodily function.

139
00:07:59,765 --> 00:08:01,515
Why not have fun with it?

140
00:08:06,213 --> 00:08:09,071
But I mean, really,
isn't queefing a bit juvenile?

141
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:12,825
Men enjoy farts, so why
shouldn't women enjoy their queefs?

142
00:08:14,664 --> 00:08:17,833
That's right. We've written
all about it in our new feminist book

143
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,308
<i>Eat, Pray, Queef</i>.

144
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,119
Well, I think what you gals are doing
for the feminist movement is amazing!

145
00:08:24,244 --> 00:08:26,964
And that's why women all over
America stand behind you!

146
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,472
Terrance and Phillip, you've put on
a terrific show for many, many years.

147
00:08:35,774 --> 00:08:37,732
You've made Canada Channel
what it is today.

148
00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:39,007
You're fired.

149
00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:40,239
Fired?

150
00:08:40,364 --> 00:08:42,581
Sorry, but this queefing thing
is really catching on.

151
00:08:42,706 --> 00:08:44,277
Their ratings are through the roof.

152
00:08:44,402 --> 00:08:47,401
To pay them, we gotta get rid of you.
Goodbye. Here's some cookies.

153
00:08:47,765 --> 00:08:49,089
Brian, don't do this!

154
00:08:49,214 --> 00:08:52,206
You can't let Canada Channel
be soiled by that perverse garbage!

155
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,557
You know it's sick!

156
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:56,013
Yes, I know it's sick.

157
00:08:56,288 --> 00:08:59,184
To be honest, I gag every time
one of them lets out a queef.

158
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:01,990
But it's money, goddammit,
and this channel needs it.

159
00:09:02,115 --> 00:09:04,626
I'm sorry, Terrance and Phillip.
Your show is down.

160
00:09:09,857 --> 00:09:11,539
I always love
when spring is on the way.

161
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:13,905
Such a fun and inspiring
time to decorate.

162
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,417
Just like most women out there,
I have really got into queefing lately.

163
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:20,329
There are a lot of fun and interesting
ways that we can decorate our queefs,

164
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:22,507
and just make them
more dynamic for the holidays.

165
00:09:22,632 --> 00:09:26,229
What we're gonna do is
just cut up some paper, like this.

166
00:09:26,354 --> 00:09:29,091
And cut out little stars
or little moon shapes.

167
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:31,695
And then just... jam those up.

168
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:34,771
And then I've got some simple
sparkles from the hobby store.

169
00:09:34,896 --> 00:09:38,585
They come in these little tubes,
which make them very easy to just shoot

170
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,556
right up the ol'...

171
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:41,831
There we are.

172
00:09:42,229 --> 00:09:44,617
And you can of course
feel free to add little flowers,

173
00:09:44,742 --> 00:09:46,724
or maybe some festive easter grass.

174
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:50,168
But the point is that when
we're done, we can let one rip.

175
00:09:52,668 --> 00:09:55,368
See how pretty that was?
It's a good thing.

176
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:10,775
What was that?

177
00:10:11,503 --> 00:10:12,953
Excuse me. I...

178
00:10:13,388 --> 00:10:15,238
I had a little air trapped.

179
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:20,005
Oh, my God.
Did you just...

180
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,550
At the table?

181
00:10:22,562 --> 00:10:23,562
Pardon me.

182
00:10:25,662 --> 00:10:26,712
Mom, gross!

183
00:10:29,634 --> 00:10:31,562
OK, that's enough, girls, all right?

184
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:35,281
- I mean, how old are you, Sharon?
- Sorry, it's just...

185
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:37,552
It's kind of funny
how much it bothers you.

186
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,311
- Yeah, that's really funny.
- Stop it, mom.

187
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:42,712
Let's just try to have
a nice dinner, OK?

188
00:10:43,996 --> 00:10:45,266
I'm sorry.

189
00:10:55,857 --> 00:10:57,007
Sharon Marsh!

190
00:10:57,984 --> 00:10:59,484
Excuse me.

191
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,183
Hey mom, do you like Australia?

192
00:11:03,308 --> 00:11:05,758
'cause that was
a Great Barrier Queef!

193
00:11:07,354 --> 00:11:09,795
- That's it. I'm leaving.
- I'm going, too.

194
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,650
Oh, please, Randy!

195
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:14,756
How many times have you farted in bed
and held my head under the covers?

196
00:11:15,183 --> 00:11:17,509
- That's completely different!
- Yeah, it's different, mom!

197
00:11:18,015 --> 00:11:20,797
All right. Tell me
exactly where the line is.

198
00:11:20,922 --> 00:11:22,305
OK, how about this?

199
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,434
I have a friend Abbey.
She had a baby boy and it farted.

200
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,972
But she was actually still
pregnant with the baby boy

201
00:11:30,097 --> 00:11:31,982
and it farted inside her.

202
00:11:34,408 --> 00:11:37,241
And then the gas from
the baby's fart traveled down

203
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:39,216
and shot out of her vagina!

204
00:11:42,783 --> 00:11:44,286
Come on, Stanley.
Let's go.

205
00:11:45,352 --> 00:11:47,122
So when does that stop being funny?

206
00:11:47,643 --> 00:11:51,251
It stopped being funny the second
that air came out her vagina, Sharon!

207
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:57,187
Look, Katherine.
I made queef cookies!

208
00:11:57,312 --> 00:11:59,402
But those are just
ginger snaps, Katie.

209
00:12:02,893 --> 00:12:04,358
Could you get that, Katie?

210
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:10,597
Oh, my God.
Look, Katherine!

211
00:12:10,722 --> 00:12:13,023
It's Canadian television stars,
Terrance and Phillip!

212
00:12:13,443 --> 00:12:15,275
Oh, my God.
They're famous!

213
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,125
Hello, sirs.
It is such an honor to meet you.

214
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,259
Oh, Katie, I'm getting
all goose bumpy and queefy.

215
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,814
May we come in, please.

216
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:28,484
Oh, certainly.
Though I fear we do look a mess.

217
00:12:28,609 --> 00:12:31,930
Pretty nice place you have here.
Network must be paying you well.

218
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:34,867
Oh, yes. The show is going
about as well as it could!

219
00:12:35,518 --> 00:12:38,531
All right! Enough with the queefing!
We didn't come for a social call.

220
00:12:38,656 --> 00:12:40,384
That's right.
We've come to kill you.

221
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,594
Why kill us?
We love you!

222
00:12:43,143 --> 00:12:46,098
You've reduced Canada Channel
to smut and toilet humor!

223
00:12:47,852 --> 00:12:51,603
Well, I suppose if we're going to die,
we should die by the hands of our idols.

224
00:12:52,582 --> 00:12:53,438
Your idols?

225
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:56,989
We grew up watching you.
You meant the world to us.

226
00:12:57,114 --> 00:12:59,650
We used to fantasize about
pleasing you in all different ways.

227
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,456
Know that it is an honor
to die by your hand.

228
00:13:05,658 --> 00:13:07,541
- I don't think I can do it.
- Why not?

229
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,666
Because I'm suddenly finding myself
strangely attracted to Katherine.

230
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:14,391
What? That's crazy, Terrance.
Katie is obviously the hot one.

231
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:24,386
Hey, Butters.
How you holding up?

232
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,082
Hey, fellas.

233
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:29,811
We got you a present.
I'll put it on your nightstand.

234
00:13:29,936 --> 00:13:32,082
None of us wanna touch you
since you got queefed on.

235
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:33,380
Thanks.

236
00:13:33,505 --> 00:13:36,305
Butters, I'm afraid
things have gotten worse.

237
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:39,401
All the women suddenly
think that... queefing is funny.

238
00:13:42,194 --> 00:13:44,711
Calm down, Butters.
The men are taking action.

239
00:13:44,836 --> 00:13:46,283
But we need to take your picture.

240
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:48,952
My picture?

241
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:51,806
You're going to be the face
of queef abuse, Butters.

242
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,915
So that we can make people
open their eyes.

243
00:14:32,478 --> 00:14:34,557
Dammit! I'm trying
to enjoy my wine, Katie!

244
00:14:34,682 --> 00:14:36,518
No, that was me, Phillip.
I farted.

245
00:14:39,391 --> 00:14:43,298
Oh, this is a dream come true!
I've always wanted to meet you, Phillip!

246
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,450
Phillip?
I'm Terrance.

247
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:50,347
- What? I thought you were Terrance!
- No, I'm Phillip!

248
00:14:51,578 --> 00:14:53,099
Oh, dear.

249
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:11,928
A disgusting and violating
trend is taking over our city,

250
00:15:12,053 --> 00:15:13,537
our state, our nation.

251
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,581
Queefing has become
an acceptable evil.

252
00:15:17,476 --> 00:15:21,211
Last week at our school, a girl
queefed right into our friend's face.

253
00:15:22,163 --> 00:15:25,313
That is why we are here to tell you
it's not a joke.

254
00:15:26,402 --> 00:15:29,016
On television, us children
are starting to see and hear

255
00:15:29,141 --> 00:15:30,679
more and more graphic queefing.

256
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:33,456
I would like to take
this opportunity to explain

257
00:15:33,581 --> 00:15:36,059
why farts are funny
and queefs are not.

258
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:40,990
Men have always joked about farts
and we, in fact, name our farts.

259
00:15:41,401 --> 00:15:42,951
We have the squeaker.

260
00:15:44,103 --> 00:15:46,103
And then there's the fog horn.

261
00:15:48,273 --> 00:15:50,073
And the "don't be scared".

262
00:15:51,963 --> 00:15:54,663
- And of course there's the...
- Excuse me!

263
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,173
If that really is your argument,
it isn't a very sound one.

264
00:15:58,298 --> 00:15:59,916
Women name their queefs, too.

265
00:16:00,412 --> 00:16:02,544
- That's right!
- Of course, we do!

266
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:05,868
For instance,
we have the sneezing unicorn.

267
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,808
And the resuscitator.

268
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:13,430
- Sick! Stop it, lady!
- That's not the same!

269
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:16,129
We've got the Chinese firecracker.

270
00:16:18,423 --> 00:16:21,823
That's all well and good,
but we can do <i>The Road Warrior</i>.

271
00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:25,831
<i>No!
We go in!</i>

272
00:16:26,155 --> 00:16:27,556
<i>We kill!</i>

273
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:29,472
<i>No more talk!
We kill!</i>

274
00:16:29,818 --> 00:16:32,967
<i>Soon, my dog of war!
But we have to do it my way!</i>

275
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,118
<i>Losers!
Losers wait!</i>

276
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:38,705
Jesus Christ!

277
00:16:42,227 --> 00:16:44,854
You stupid bitch!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

278
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:48,048
I'm not your sex toy,
you fucking pig!

279
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:52,510
You don't queef in bed
while we're having sex!

280
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:54,638
Fuck you!
You don't fucking slap me!

281
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:59,100
Could you please keep it down.
We're trying to have sex over here.

282
00:16:59,577 --> 00:17:01,311
She queefed while
we were having sex!

283
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,828
- Sick!
- What's the big deal?

284
00:17:03,953 --> 00:17:06,260
I've been queefing
in this bed the entire time!

285
00:17:06,385 --> 00:17:07,885
What? Gross!

286
00:17:08,326 --> 00:17:09,611
How dare you!

287
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:13,239
Get out! Get out, both of you!
We never want to see you again!

288
00:17:13,606 --> 00:17:15,549
After everything we've been through?

289
00:17:24,305 --> 00:17:28,309
What the hell am I gonna do, Phillip?
She makes me so mad sometimes.

290
00:17:28,434 --> 00:17:29,968
Katherine just won't stop queefing.

291
00:17:30,093 --> 00:17:32,175
But I don't know
if I can live without her.

292
00:17:36,445 --> 00:17:38,058
Katie, I'm sorry.

293
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:40,062
- I was wrong.
- Me too, Katherine.

294
00:17:40,187 --> 00:17:42,830
I don't love your queefs.
But dammit, I love you.

295
00:17:42,955 --> 00:17:44,688
- Oh, Terrance!
- Phillip!

296
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,784
Oh, my God!

297
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,757
Oh, my God! Stan!
Stan, we did it!

298
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:05,275
Colorado Senate moves
to ban queefing!

299
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,836
- No way! We did it?
- All right, son!

300
00:18:08,358 --> 00:18:09,858
What's going on?

301
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:12,507
Read it and weep, Sharon!
No more queefing!

302
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,319
Well, congratulations, guys.

303
00:18:18,705 --> 00:18:20,305
Looks like you got us.

304
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:22,284
Good job.

305
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:26,563
Come on. Just 'cause
you can't queef anymore...

306
00:18:27,383 --> 00:18:30,633
You really think women cared
that much about queefing?

307
00:18:31,161 --> 00:18:33,820
Is that really what you think
this has all been about?

308
00:18:35,277 --> 00:18:39,281
This has been about women
having a little bit of fun for once

309
00:18:39,566 --> 00:18:41,139
at your expense.

310
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,233
For just this one time,

311
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:46,683
we could be the immature ones
to make you feel uncomfortable.

312
00:18:47,248 --> 00:18:49,511
But, no. You just
couldn't let us have

313
00:18:49,636 --> 00:18:51,463
that one little thing, could you?

314
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:54,452
Because even though things
are getting better for women,

315
00:18:54,577 --> 00:18:57,051
you still think of us
as lesser people sometimes,

316
00:18:57,395 --> 00:19:00,212
and we always have to prove
ourselves twice as hard.

317
00:19:00,927 --> 00:19:02,628
Congratulations, guys,

318
00:19:03,219 --> 00:19:05,109
for getting your way.

319
00:19:05,836 --> 00:19:06,936
Again.

320
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,083
Mom, we didn't mean...

321
00:19:16,728 --> 00:19:18,228
Boy, oh, boy.

322
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:21,365
I think we might have
screwed up royal, Stan.

323
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:26,705
Yeah. We all got so caught up
in how we felt that we didn't realize

324
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,223
women actually cared about
something a lot deeper.

325
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:33,955
Stan, let's call the guys together.

326
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:36,361
Maybe we can make this right.

327
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,210
<i>There's a time in our lives</i>

328
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:44,140
<i>when we must listen
to the oppressed.</i>

329
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,066
<i>And realize</i>

330
00:19:46,191 --> 00:19:49,270
<i>we've been keeping women down.</i>

331
00:19:50,146 --> 00:19:52,482
<i>They have power
and they have courage.</i>

332
00:19:52,876 --> 00:19:55,401
<i>And we must all stand by the belief</i>

333
00:19:55,826 --> 00:19:57,285
<i>that a woman is strong</i>

334
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,949
<i>and she has the right to queef.</i>

335
00:20:01,503 --> 00:20:03,803
<i>Fly free.</i>

336
00:20:04,564 --> 00:20:06,324
<i>Free to queef aloud.</i>

337
00:20:06,449 --> 00:20:08,668
<i>Fly free.</i>

338
00:20:09,106 --> 00:20:12,112
<i>Let every queef show
that you're proud.</i>

339
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:14,713
<i>You faced so many challenges</i>

340
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,257
<i>to put an end to your grief.</i>

341
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:19,267
<i>You're a woman now</i>

342
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:22,610
<i>and you are free to queef.</i>

343
00:20:23,685 --> 00:20:25,950
<i>It's time for equality.</i>

344
00:20:26,075 --> 00:20:29,000
<i>We must give them
the respect they deserve.</i>

345
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:31,829
<i>They're just the same as you and me.</i>

346
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,335
<i>Their rights must be preserved.</i>

347
00:20:37,512 --> 00:20:40,212
<i>Queef free!</i>

348
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:42,331
<i>Every woman has the right.</i>

349
00:20:42,456 --> 00:20:44,864
<i>Queef free.</i>

350
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:48,003
<i>Let your queefing star shine bright.</i>

351
00:20:48,128 --> 00:20:50,484
<i>You are woman, hear you roar.</i>

352
00:20:50,912 --> 00:20:53,162
<i>Queefing too loud to ignore.</i>

353
00:20:53,758 --> 00:20:55,078
<i>Queef a little each day</i>

354
00:20:55,203 --> 00:20:59,071
<i>and let your soul take flight.</i>

355
00:21:02,743 --> 00:21:05,443
<i>Queef free!</i>

356
00:21:12,181 --> 00:21:15,519
For this reason, a man
will leave his father and mother,

357
00:21:15,644 --> 00:21:19,480
and be united to his wife,
and the two will become one flesh.

358
00:21:22,461 --> 00:21:24,973
Stop it, Katherine!
This is a serious moment.

359
00:21:25,098 --> 00:21:27,725
Therefore what God
has joined together, let no man...

360
00:21:30,966 --> 00:21:32,466
Oh, sick!

361
00:21:35,604 --> 00:21:37,462
That's it!
I pronounce you farts and queefs!

362
