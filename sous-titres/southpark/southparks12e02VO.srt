South Park - Season 12 Episode 2
"Britney's New Look"

2
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:36,239
<i>Live, from Chicago, Illinois,
it's Decision 2008.</i>

3
00:00:36,847 --> 00:00:39,445
Good evening and welcome
to the political debate

4
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:42,697
between Hillary Rodham Clinton
and Barack Obama.

5
00:00:42,817 --> 00:00:47,459
First question: How do you see yourself
as different from your opponent?

6
00:00:48,764 --> 00:00:51,155
Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?

7
00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:54,563
This is important, Stanley!
You boys should care about this stuff.

8
00:00:54,683 --> 00:00:56,165
Yeah, but we totally don't.

9
00:00:56,285 --> 00:01:00,138
Well you boys are gonna sit and
watch this! This is what really matters!

10
00:01:00,398 --> 00:01:05,310
And so, Mr. Obama, why don't you tell us
your stance on military spending?

11
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:08,229
Well, my opinion is that-

12
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:12,191
<i>We interrupt this debate
for an emergency news bulletin!</i>

13
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:14,398
<i>It's... Britney Watch!</i>

14
00:01:14,518 --> 00:01:17,113
<i>Keeping you up-to-date with
all your Britney Spears news!</i>

15
00:01:18,197 --> 00:01:20,485
Oh-oh boy, what's she done now?

16
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:24,131
Britney has been spotted
camping in the Colorado mountains,

17
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:28,396
and one report claims that
she has taken a piss... in the forest.

18
00:01:28,516 --> 00:01:30,043
Robert Pooner has more.

19
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,865
Ron, I'm standing in South Mark,
Colorado,

20
00:01:32,985 --> 00:01:36,345
where Britney Spears has apparently
been trying to get away from it all.

21
00:01:36,465 --> 00:01:37,895
Aw dude, that's our town!

22
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,634
Ms. Spears was spotted
at a mountain campground,

23
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:42,770
and you won't believe what she did, Ron.

24
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:47,090
The troubled diva took a piss.
Right on a ladybug.

25
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:50,063
We've blurred out parts of
the photo so that it doesn't offend.

26
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:54,703
She's such a train wreck!

27
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,403
When the photo is enhance, Ron,

28
00:01:56,663 --> 00:01:59,906
you can see the poor little
ladybug getting doused.

29
00:02:00,556 --> 00:02:04,568
This must be very embarrassing for
Britney that this photo got out, Bob,

30
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:06,715
and she looks like she's gained weight.

31
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,925
That's right, Ron,
she really chubbed up.

32
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,675
And if you zoom in on her face,

33
00:02:10,795 --> 00:02:13,378
you can see that she's got some zits!

34
00:02:13,712 --> 00:02:15,037
Aw, poor girl.

35
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:18,049
Hey Sharon, Britney peed on a ladybug.

36
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:22,154
The photograph was taken
by Brian Willis of Bailey, Colorado,

37
00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:25,306
who sold it to 31 News
for a hundred thousand dollars.

38
00:02:26,368 --> 00:02:27,994
A hundred thousand dollars?

39
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:30,015
That's enough to buy slaves!

40
00:02:30,135 --> 00:02:34,244
Britney is said to be now
hiding out in a South Park motel.

41
00:02:34,364 --> 00:02:37,277
And now back to the
stupid Democratic debates.

42
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:40,029
-and spearchuckers.

43
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,566
Did you guys hear that? A hundred
thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.

44
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:46,393
And she's at a hotel in our town.

45
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:49,165
It's gotta be the Komfort Inn.
That's the nicest hotel in South Park.

46
00:02:49,285 --> 00:02:51,916
- Cartman, go get your camera.
- Sweet!

47
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:54,104
Hey, hang on, fellas,

48
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:56,079
don't you think Britney's
been through enough?

49
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:00,599
I mean, maybe it's finally time
for us all to just leave her alone.

50
00:03:01,028 --> 00:03:03,359
Butters, don't be such a pussy.

51
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,763
Okay.

52
00:03:06,363 --> 00:03:09,026
A hundred thousand for a picture
of Britney peeing on a ladybug.

53
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:12,112
Imagine what a photo of her
crapping on a squirrel is worth!

54
00:03:12,232 --> 00:03:15,144
Well this costume was supposed
to be for the Easter musical, fellas,

55
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:17,275
not for trying to make an easy buck!

56
00:03:17,856 --> 00:03:19,306
Oh no.

57
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:24,905
Excuse us, we're trying to
get a picture of Britney Spears!

58
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:26,155
Join the club.

59
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:30,106
Yeah, all you amateur photographers are
making this tougher on the professionals!

60
00:03:30,226 --> 00:03:32,624
We're professionals too,
you fucking butthole!

61
00:03:33,918 --> 00:03:36,155
Ah ah, nobody goes upstairs.

62
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:38,783
We uh, we have special permission?

63
00:03:38,903 --> 00:03:42,050
Yeah, don't you recognize us?
We're Britney Spears' kids.

64
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:44,099
You are?

65
00:03:44,244 --> 00:03:46,744
Not me! I'm a squirrel!

66
00:03:47,283 --> 00:03:49,920
But now everybody
thinks I hate ladybugs.

67
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,022
I didn't even know it was there.

68
00:03:52,142 --> 00:03:55,063
I can't take it anymore. I'm just so-

69
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:59,818
Excuse me, Ms. Spears, but your kids are
here and they've brought you a squirrel.

70
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,322
My boys? Really? Send them in.

71
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:07,842
It's okay.
My kids are here. I feel better now.

72
00:04:09,815 --> 00:04:12,266
- We did it guys!
- I told you that would work!

73
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:15,191
- Yeah, all right!
- All right!

74
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:17,807
You mean, it was just a joke?

75
00:04:17,927 --> 00:04:19,295
My kids ain't here?

76
00:04:19,555 --> 00:04:22,116
- Alright. Butters, go get next to her.
- I ain't doing it!

77
00:04:22,236 --> 00:04:23,925
We tricked her and it wasn't nice!

78
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:26,385
Butters, do you want your share of
the hundred thousand dollars or not?

79
00:04:26,505 --> 00:04:28,664
You're never gonna
leave me alone, are you?

80
00:04:28,784 --> 00:04:31,810
It ain't right to take advantage
of somebody no matter who they are!

81
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,995
All right, fine!
We don't need you, Butters!

82
00:04:34,115 --> 00:04:36,005
Yeah, we'll just get a picture
of her doing something else.

83
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,435
All right lady,
just flash us your crotch or something.

84
00:04:38,555 --> 00:04:40,817
- I've got a better idea.
- You do?

85
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,619
Yeah.

86
00:04:43,612 --> 00:04:44,612
No!

87
00:05:00,481 --> 00:05:02,381
You killed her!

88
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,880
Hey, everything all right u-. Oh.

89
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:25,683
We should have just left her alone.
But we just had to push her.

90
00:05:25,803 --> 00:05:29,741
How cold we know she would...
Aw we suck so hard.

91
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:36,080
She's... alive.

92
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:38,487
- Whew.
- Oh, thank God.

93
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:40,466
But, we almost lost her.

94
00:05:40,586 --> 00:05:42,629
Why couldn't you boys
just leave her alone?

95
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:44,930
Doctor, could we talk
to her for a minute?

96
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,549
I don't want you making her upset.

97
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,677
We don't wanna upset her, we
just want to tell her that we're sorry.

98
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:52,305
All right.

99
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:56,935
Ms. Spears,
these boys wanted to say something.

100
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:01,481
- Oh my God!
- Oh no!

101
00:06:01,906 --> 00:06:06,069
The boys are just shocked at how
good you look, Britney. Right, boys?

102
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:10,365
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
It's not even noticeable.

103
00:06:13,146 --> 00:06:16,046
Well, I'll let you boys have your say.

104
00:06:20,975 --> 00:06:22,667
Ms. Spears, uh...

105
00:06:22,787 --> 00:06:26,146
we're... really... sorry for
making you want to kill yourself.

106
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,816
Oh, God, what have we done?

107
00:06:29,977 --> 00:06:32,140
<i>It's Britney Watch!</i>

108
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,806
<i>Keeping you up-to-date with
all your Britney Spears news!</i>

109
00:06:35,674 --> 00:06:38,265
You won't believe
what Britney's done now.

110
00:06:38,385 --> 00:06:41,849
The troubled pop star has
just been spotted with a crazy

111
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:43,940
"no top part of my head" look.

112
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,361
This video was taken just hours ago

113
00:06:46,481 --> 00:06:49,345
as Britney was wheeled into
the hospital for some reason.

114
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:52,305
And if we zoom in on the footage,
right, right here,

115
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:55,118
you can also definitely
see a boob job scar.

116
00:06:55,378 --> 00:06:58,538
No doubt now that she's
had plastic surgery in the past.

117
00:06:58,798 --> 00:07:01,934
O ho ho, oh houch,
that's gotta be embarrassing.

118
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:06,879
Chris, any word on why Ms. Spears went
for this radical "no top of the head" look?

119
00:07:07,274 --> 00:07:10,469
No word yet, Tom,
but it could be over the embarrassment

120
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:13,943
of the boob job scar video
we showed just, just now.

121
00:07:14,063 --> 00:07:16,305
Uh, even though the timing
doesn't quite work out.

122
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,146
Dude!

123
00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:28,890
Damnit, she can't handle
any stress right now!

124
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,201
Excuse me, I'm Britney Spears' manager.

125
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:32,934
Oh, jeez, Britney!

126
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:34,779
Britney, what were you thinking?

127
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:38,159
First you shave your head and now this.

128
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:41,956
Well, it's a ballsy new look,
I'll give you that.

129
00:07:42,623 --> 00:07:45,376
Brit! Over here, Brit.
One for Star Weekly.

130
00:07:45,976 --> 00:07:49,178
Damnit you have to take her out of here;
she can't be around all this right now.

131
00:07:49,298 --> 00:07:52,570
Right. We need to take her home.
Boys, can you give me a hand with her?

132
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,968
Yeah, of course.

133
00:07:56,096 --> 00:07:57,305
Okay, come on!

134
00:07:58,123 --> 00:08:00,373
My car is right here.

135
00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:02,518
- Hey look!
- There she is!

136
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,460
Oh crap!

137
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:14,536
Jesus Christ!

138
00:08:14,656 --> 00:08:16,348
Yeah yeah, it's like this all the time.

139
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:18,201
Thank you! Yes, thanks.

140
00:08:23,823 --> 00:08:28,503
Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and
we wanna help Britney however we can.

141
00:08:28,623 --> 00:08:32,425
That's great, boys. Britney seems
to have really taken a liking to you.

142
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,887
And don't worry: Britney
is a queen at reinventing herself.

143
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:39,269
We just need to get her into
the recording studio right away.

144
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:40,389
What?

145
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:45,962
All right, Britney, let's take it from the top.
Remember to bring that sexiness to it.

146
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:48,920
Excuse me, is this really what
you think she should be doing right now?

147
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,240
All right,
Brit, let's try it from the top.

148
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:05,414
- God, what a train wreck.
- She must be stoned again.

149
00:09:12,724 --> 00:09:15,836
Would you put a stop to this, please?
This is only gonna make things worse.

150
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,844
What do you mean? She sounds great.

151
00:09:19,046 --> 00:09:21,099
Ah, Britney,
that last lyric is supposed to be

152
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:24,559
"love elation." Sounds more
like you're saying "love creation."

153
00:09:26,362 --> 00:09:30,012
E-la-tion. Really enunciate the L.

154
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:33,040
Gah, she's so stupid.

155
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,029
What do you expect? Look at her!
She doesn't have most of her brain!

156
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:38,164
I know. She's really dumb, huh?

157
00:09:38,284 --> 00:09:41,897
No, I mean, she literally doesn't have
most of her brain! Her head is gone!

158
00:09:42,017 --> 00:09:44,412
Yeah. And she's all fat, too.

159
00:09:46,892 --> 00:09:50,918
<i>Live, from Las Vegas,
it's the MTV Video Music Awards.</i>

160
00:09:51,178 --> 00:09:54,823
What's up, y'all? It's the MTV
Awards and we are kicking it off right.

161
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:59,719
Here to perform her new song is the one,
and only, Britney Spears!

162
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:06,859
Aw come on now, people!

163
00:10:06,979 --> 00:10:09,812
Oh my God, she's really gotten chubby.

164
00:10:37,793 --> 00:10:40,541
Oh man, she's totally lip-syncing.

165
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:43,389
She doesn't have any lips!

166
00:10:56,728 --> 00:10:58,761
Disaster at the MTV awards.

167
00:10:58,881 --> 00:11:01,393
People are ridiculing Britney Spears.

168
00:11:01,513 --> 00:11:03,438
Her performance was awful, Tom.

169
00:11:03,558 --> 00:11:06,245
She looked tired,
she looked fat, she didn't have a head.

170
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,120
It was just completely phoned in.

171
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,659
No doubt,
Tom, that girl has major issues.

172
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:14,572
Don't listen to 'em, Brit!
They're all just jealous.

173
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:17,792
And we can put you
on SlimFast tomorrow.

174
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,630
Hang on, hang on,
she'll be out in a minute.

175
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,789
We have to get her
away from all this, dude.

176
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:41,503
People just aren't gonna let up.

177
00:11:41,623 --> 00:11:45,095
We have to take her somewhere
to just be at peace.

178
00:11:45,215 --> 00:11:50,065
Dude, where in the world can Britney
Spears go where nobody will bother her?

179
00:11:51,162 --> 00:11:52,812
I know where.

180
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,222
We want three tickets to the North Pole.

181
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:02,267
The North Pole?
Who the hell goes to the North Pole?

182
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:04,510
We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt.

183
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:09,140
<i>It's Britney Wowtch!</i>

184
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,488
A distraught Britney Spears
has apparently disappeared

185
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:14,975
and abandoned all those close to her.

186
00:12:15,095 --> 00:12:19,066
A local housewife caught a photo of
Britney running away in this disguise!

187
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,220
Britney is obviously very
upset about her MTV performance, Ron,

188
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,104
and so she's become desperate.

189
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:29,924
Most troubling for her is the fact
that her disguise has total camel toe.

190
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:36,358
Oh boy, now, Leslie, this seems
like a really bad camel toe offense.

191
00:12:36,478 --> 00:12:41,442
Absolutely major camel toe, Tracy.
Britney just seems oblivious.

192
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:42,969
She was bound to get noticed:

193
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:46,677
you walk around with that kind
of cam toe and you're gonna turn heads.

194
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,389
David, any idea as to how
big the camel toe actually was?

195
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:53,206
She was sporting toe
like never before, Brian.

196
00:12:53,326 --> 00:12:55,342
I don't know what's
wrong with that girl, but,

197
00:12:55,462 --> 00:12:58,022
it's a slap in the face
to camels all over the planet.

198
00:12:58,282 --> 00:13:00,617
Those close to Britney
say they are very worried

199
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:02,516
and want to bring her home safe.

200
00:13:02,636 --> 00:13:04,587
And now back to the local news.

201
00:13:04,707 --> 00:13:08,414
The giant squirrel which was
picked up last week by animal control

202
00:13:08,534 --> 00:13:11,085
apparently now thinks it's a person.

203
00:13:11,205 --> 00:13:14,042
Colorado officials have taken
the squirrel to Johns-Hopkins

204
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:15,915
for psychiatric evaluation.

205
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:19,710
Hm, that squirrel is obviously nuts.

206
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:24,920
Platform 4F. Uh, it must
be on the other side of the station.

207
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,390
There she is! It's Britney!

208
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,783
Oh no.

209
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,842
Dude, they're never
gonna let us through.

210
00:13:40,962 --> 00:13:43,275
Yes they are! I have an idea.

211
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,767
Britney? Where'd she go?

212
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:48,839
There she is!

213
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:10,869
It's okay,
you'll be in the North Pole soon.

214
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,952
There she is. Hey Britney, it's me.

215
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,199
Britney. It's over.
What were you running for anyway?

216
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:35,619
Hey, wait a minute.
Where's her camel toe?

217
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:38,164
I'm not Britney Spears, alright?

218
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:42,030
Oh, psych! She must be back
at the train station; come on!

219
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,463
Now, wait a minute!
Everyone just stop for one minute!

220
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:49,008
Look, you guys are
gonna end up killing her.

221
00:14:49,128 --> 00:14:52,386
Can't you see that Britney isn't in any
condition to handle this crap anymore?

222
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,435
I know watching celebrities
go down can be fun.

223
00:14:57,555 --> 00:15:00,105
Me and my friends are
as guilty as all of you, but

224
00:15:00,225 --> 00:15:02,992
maybe, just, maybe,

225
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:05,191
...it's time to let this one go.

226
00:15:06,263 --> 00:15:10,112
Just this one time, let's, let's
all stop before it's too late, huh?

227
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,603
Son, you don't seem to understand.

228
00:15:14,723 --> 00:15:17,381
Britney Spears... has to die.

229
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:20,372
Huh?

230
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,584
What do you think all
this effort has been for?

231
00:15:23,896 --> 00:15:25,520
It cannot be stopped.

232
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,755
The purpose is too great.

233
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:30,015
She must... die.

234
00:15:43,426 --> 00:15:45,856
<i>Little Stanley was tired and hungry.</i>

235
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:49,262
<i>But he knew that for
Britney Spears to be safe,</i>

236
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:52,383
<i>he had to get her to the North Pole.</i>

237
00:15:52,503 --> 00:15:54,853
You doing okay, Ms. Spears?

238
00:15:58,269 --> 00:15:59,430
It's her.

239
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,581
Um no, I'm sure it's Britney Spears;
it looks just like the picture.

240
00:16:05,342 --> 00:16:07,825
You want me to, to what?

241
00:16:07,945 --> 00:16:09,845
Yes, I understand.

242
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:23,610
Hello, I'm Bob Summers,
so happy you picked our little town.

243
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,589
What is going on?
Why do you want Britney Spears to die?

244
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:28,908
Well nobody wants her to die,
little boy.

245
00:16:29,028 --> 00:16:31,960
We all simply... need her to.

246
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,238
- Do you understand?
- No!

247
00:16:34,655 --> 00:16:35,993
Look, kid,

248
00:16:36,113 --> 00:16:39,933
throughout history people have
found it necessary to engage in...

249
00:16:40,053 --> 00:16:41,620
human sacrifice.

250
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,235
In ancient times,
humans would commonly

251
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:48,134
pick one lovely girl, adorn her
with jewels, treat her like a goddess,

252
00:16:48,254 --> 00:16:50,254
and then... watch her die.

253
00:16:50,514 --> 00:16:52,755
We like to think we're
more civilized now,

254
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,805
but the truth is our
lust for torture and death

255
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:57,052
is no different than
it was in gladiator times.

256
00:16:57,312 --> 00:16:59,615
Only difference is that
now we like to watch people

257
00:16:59,735 --> 00:17:02,057
put to death through
magazines and photographs.

258
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,624
It's a damn shame too.
Old ways were butter.

259
00:17:05,744 --> 00:17:09,315
Used to be we just picked someone by
lottery and then stoned them to death.

260
00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:13,652
Stoning to death was too violent.
Rather have the sacrifice kill itself.

261
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:16,614
You mean everyone has been
wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?

262
00:17:16,874 --> 00:17:19,130
Britney was chosen a long time ago,

263
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,765
to be built up and adored,

264
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:23,370
and then sacrificed. For harvest.

265
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:25,789
All right, everyone's about here.

266
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:28,834
Who's everyone? Who all is in on this?

267
00:17:32,949 --> 00:17:35,949
Hey, where are we? This isn't right.

268
00:17:39,813 --> 00:17:41,263
Oh no!

269
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:43,891
Come on, Britney!

270
00:17:45,514 --> 00:17:47,019
Come on, come on!

271
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,134
Mom, Dad!

272
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:21,713
They're gonna kill her!
They're going to in-

273
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,775
Wait, what are you doing here?

274
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:26,795
It's okay, Kyle. Just... be a good boy.

275
00:18:26,915 --> 00:18:29,812
Be a good boy? You know all about this?

276
00:18:30,072 --> 00:18:31,814
Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?

277
00:18:32,074 --> 00:18:34,233
She's been built up
to be sacrificed, Stan!

278
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:35,984
Sacrificed? For what?

279
00:18:36,244 --> 00:18:39,405
For harvest, Stanley.
Same reason we've always done it.

280
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:43,583
Sacrifice in March,
corn have plenty starch.

281
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:45,508
Corn harvest!

282
00:18:45,628 --> 00:18:48,561
We haven't told you about it,
Stanley, because we,

283
00:18:48,681 --> 00:18:51,880
we like to wait until kids are
a little older to talk to them about

284
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,255
things like condoms and ritualistic
human sacrifice for harvest.

285
00:18:56,784 --> 00:19:00,834
All right, enough already!
This has all gone on long enough!

286
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:04,638
The kid is right.
This has gone on too long.

287
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:08,308
Yeah. She was supposed to
have killed herself a long time ago.

288
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:10,742
And harvest is coming soon.

289
00:19:10,862 --> 00:19:14,112
All right, folks,
let's finish this quickly.

290
00:19:22,937 --> 00:19:24,337
No wait.

291
00:19:35,298 --> 00:19:36,764
Come on, hurry up.

292
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,631
I can't run.
You go ahead, I'll catch up with ya.

293
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:49,767
Here Davey.

294
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:05,478
Hold on.

295
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:10,162
She's dead.

296
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:15,833
Well, I think it's time for
us to leave the poor girl alone.

297
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:57,724
- Morning, Bill.
- Morning, Gil.

298
00:20:57,844 --> 00:20:59,545
Nice-looking corn.

299
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:02,548


300
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,645
Hey Sharon, Randy, great harvest, huh?

301
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:11,306
An incredible harvest. Some
of the best corn I've seen in years.

302
00:21:11,566 --> 00:21:13,555
<i>- She's the daughter of a country singer,</i>
- Hey, check it out!

303
00:21:13,675 --> 00:21:17,024
<i>and the young girl has really
taken the country by storm.</i>

304
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:19,231
<i>Hannah Montana's Miley Cyrus,</i>

305
00:21:19,491 --> 00:21:21,123
though only fifteen years old,

306
00:21:21,243 --> 00:21:24,069
is already on her way
to being a major superstar.

307
00:21:26,248 --> 00:21:29,199
Looks like next harvest
will be even better.

308
