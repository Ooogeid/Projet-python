Season 13 Episode 12
"The F Word"

3
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,294
Isn't this great, you guys?

4
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,255
Gettin' away from it all.
Leaving all our cares behind.

5
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,924
{\*Yeah, and }They said the weather's
gonna be nice like this all day!

6
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,427
This is exactly what I needed.

7
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,017
Not those guys again!

8
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:04,022
God dammit, why is it that every time
we try and have a relaxing day

9
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,649
a bunch of assholes
on their Harley motorcycles show up?

10
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,071
God, shut up!

11
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,156
Piss off you stupid assholes!

12
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,038
Isn't this great food?

13
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,540
You're so right about this place.
It's wonderful!

14
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,583
{\*You know}What's really interesting is that...

15
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,643
What's {\*really }interesting is that this place
has a new owner, and they...

16
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,688
On this gorgeous day

17
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,148
we bring these two together
for the most important...

18
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,909
Everybody is checkin' us out.

19
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,370
They think we're pretty cool!

20
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,336
We were definitely
turnin' some heads out there!

21
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,047
I was pullin' back on that throttle,

22
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,633
and everybody was like,
"What is that?"

23
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:14,759
For sure!

24
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,387
Nobody here
is really paying attention to us.

25
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,433
That's weird.

26
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,528
That's better.

27
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,591
All right.
Let's head out!

28
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,140
Excuse me!

29
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,100
Excuse me!
Hey, assholes!

30
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,772
You guys know that...

31
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,274
everyone thinks
you're total fags, right?

32
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,735
What did you say?

33
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,654
{\*You know, }When {\*people like }you drive down the streets

34
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,574
with your unnecessarily
loud motorcycles thinking you're {\*all }cool,

35
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,410
everyone is {\*actually }laughing at you
and calling you pathetic faggots.

36
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,786
You do realize this{\*, right}?

37
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,791
Hey, man.
We roll how we roll

38
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,210
and if people are annoyed
or intimidated by it,

39
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,045
that's too bad for them!

40
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:36,966
Nobody is intimidated, actually.

41
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,928
Everyone realizes that people
who are so needy for attention,

42
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,847
they need to dress up
and be as loud as possible are you{\* guys}

43
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,516
and sixteen year old girls.

44
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,642
Just wanted to let you know
you're {\*fucking }fags.

45
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,608
That...

46
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:57,028
that little boy just called us fags.

47
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,446
Like he didn't think we were cool.

48
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,865
But he's wrong!

49
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,117
People don't think we're fags!
Do they?

50
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,537
Course, he's wrong!
And anyway,

51
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:09,123
nobody except that little freak
would ever say {\*something like }that to our faces!

52
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,541
That's right!

53
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,294
Com on, let's roll!

54
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,545
Rev 'em up!

55
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,478
Fags!

56
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,235
- Did that kid just call us...
- Just ignore him!

57
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,659
{\$FAGS}

58
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,666
- God dammit, this is fucked up!
- What's wrong with kids today?

59
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,840
It doesn't make any sense.

60
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,966
They all called us fags.

61
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,928
How can they call us fags?
I mean, listen to this!

62
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,016
I know.
Look, guys...

63
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,060
{\*I think }I know what the problem is{\* here}.

64
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,478
- Really?
- You do?

65
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,566
Think about it, guys!
You see all the things kids have today?

66
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:20,194
{\*I mean, }With their Xboxes and surround sound
entertainment systems.

67
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,239
Kids today are surrounded
by big loud stuff all the time.

68
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,701
- That's right!
- That's all it is, guys.

69
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,328
We just need to get a little louder.
That's all!

70
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,294
Broflovski looks for Kenny
{\*to get clear }for the pass.

71
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,129
But Cartman isn't letting up on him!

72
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,381
What the hell?

73
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,977
Chicken spears!

74
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,399
God dammit!

75
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,111
Now we're turnin' some heads!

76
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,406
Let's see them call us fags now!

77
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,536
All right.
Thanks for coming{\*, everyone}.

78
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,164
As you all know,
the Harley problem {\*seems to be}is getting worse,

79
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,249
and nobody
is willing to do anything{\* about it}.

80
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,375
- Yes.
- Agreed.

81
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:20,254
I have had it
with those loud annoying... faggots.

82
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,216
{\*Now }We have some ideas.
We'd love to hear {\*your ideas}yours and {\*I think that }together{\* we}...

83
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,391
and {\*I think that }together we can {\*come up with a way to }get rid
of these fags once and for all.

84
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,184
Sounds good.

85
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,477
What are you {\*guys }talking about?
Harley's are neat-o!

86
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,064
- What?
- I always thought

87
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,441
someday when I grow up
I'm gonna get a Harley!

88
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:44,028
Then people will have to notice me,
and {\*they'll have to }deal with my shit for once!

89
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,365
The open road!
The wind in my face!

90
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,450
I'll go from city to city!

91
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,121
Everyone lookin' at me!

92
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,582
Who's that guy?
He must be tough!

93
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,713
I'll have my girl on the back seat,
holdin' on to my fat belly.

94
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,008
Sure, she's missin' a few teeth,
but she's thinks I'm cool!

95
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,761
That's why when I grow up,
I'm gonna be a Harley rider.

96
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,972
That makes perfect sense{\*, Butters}.

97
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,851
- It does?
- Yes. Now, get out of here.

98
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,105
{\*All right. }Kyle and I {\*are gonna}will spray {\*paint }messages to {\*the Harley riders}them.
Cartman, you said you had an idea?

99
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,693
{\*I think }What I'm gonna do is find {\*out wherever }there bikes{\* are}
and crap on their seats.

100
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,486
- {\*That's }Good.
- {\*Yeah, }I think that'll be nice.

101
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,488
{\*But }That's a lot of seats,
how are you gonna {\*pull that off}do?

102
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,491
I think I just need two,
maybe three buckets of KFC.

103
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,618
Extra crispy.
Probably four cartons of gravy.

104
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:36,289
Clyde can {\*you take care of getting}get the KFC for Cartman,
Kyle and I can get the spray paint cans.

105
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,833
If we do this right,
we'll {\*be doing }do the town a huge favor.

106
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,126
So let's get to it!

107
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,342
- That was a good breakfast!
- I'm full!

108
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,515
You {\*guys }smell that?

109
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,602
It smells like
that new <i>Famous Bowl</i> at KFC.

110
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,774
Somebody took a shit
on my fucking Harley!

111
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,900
What?

112
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,070
Me too!
I got shit all over my pants now!

113
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,366
There's little flags
stuck in the shit!

114
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,577
"You're fags."

115
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,829
You gotta be kiddin' me!

116
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,874
Come on!
We'll find the bastards who did this!

117
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,427
{\$FAGS GET OUT}

118
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,858
This can't be happening!

119
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,613
Really nice work{\, guys}.

120
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,614
{\*I think }Maybe everything is gonna be okay{\* now}.

121
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,784
So I said to the guy,

122
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,244
you really think
I'm paying that much?

123
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,413
Jesus Christ.

124
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,458
Oh, my God!

125
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,920
I thought we were past this.

126
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,676
Students, I am here
because of a very serious matter.

127
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,471
This morning it was discovered
that in several places all over town,

128
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:19,058
somebody had spray painted the words
"fags get out".

129
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,603
Many witnesses reported
seeing children with spray paint.

130
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,480
{\now, }If anybody knows anything

131
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,648
about{\ the kids} who did this,
you must come forward.

132
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,858
That was us!

133
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,195
- Excuse me?
- We did that.

134
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,158
Why would you write
something like that and be proud of it?

135
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,745
'cause we want all those fags
to get out of our town.

136
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,789
Everyone hates those fags, right?

137
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,543
Now just what the heck
is going on here?

138
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,879
This is not what we have taught you
in this school.

139
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,923
Kyle and Stan, you've always been
tolerant of gay people!

140
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,635
- Gay people?
- We aren't talking about gay people.

141
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,472
You just admitted to spray painting
that they should get out of town!

142
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,474
Why we would we want that{\gay people to get out of town}?

143
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,727
They think we meant gay fags.

144
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,729
That's not very nice, mayor.

145
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,105
Just because a person is gay
doesn't mean he's a fag.

146
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,941
What?

147
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,194
You four boys in my office, now!

148
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,238
Crap!

149
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,994
{\pub}"Faggot, often shortened to fag,

150
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,623
"has been used
in the English language

151
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,000
"since the late 16th century.

152
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,919
"Its original meaning was

153
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,463
"an old or unpleasant woman."

154
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,215
That certainly don't apply to us!

155
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,301
"Faggot later was defined

156
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,428
"as a bundle of sticks,

"and in the 19th century
a faggot gatherer

00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,019
"was someone who made
a meager living gathering firewood."

159
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,356
They certainly ain't callin' us fags
'cause we gather sticks!

160
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,149
There's got to be more!

161
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,991
What's that part say there?

162
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,327
"Later, the term fag was defined

163
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,080
"as any awkward bundle
to be carried,

"and was often used
as an insult to the elderly,

165
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,752
"as in calling them baggage."

166
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,422
Fag was used as an insult to women,
then poor people,

167
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,840
then old people?

170
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,808
"against homosexuals
and transgender people

171
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,810
"in the United States."

172
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,813
That word
just keeps changing its meaning!

173
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,856
What's it got to do with us?

174
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,033
We are really trying
to understand this.

175
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,743
How is it that you{\* boys} think referring

176
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:46,205
to gay people as "fags"
in today's world is acceptable?

177
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,624
Because we're not referring
to gay people.

178
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,626
- You can be gay and not be a fag.
- A lot of fags aren't gay.

179
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,630
I happen to be gay, boys.
Do you think I'm a fag?

180
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,675
Do you ride a {\* big loud }Harley
and go up and down the streets

181
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,176
ruining everyone's nice time?

182
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,137
Then you're not a fag.

183
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,475
So what if a guy is gay
and rides a Harley?

184
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,520
Then he's a gay fag.
{\I mean, }Is this really this hard?

185
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,771
I don't know.

186
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,942
You're driving in your car, okay?

187
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,029
You're waiting to make a left{\at a traffic signal}.
The light turns yellow.

188
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,948
Should be your turn{\ to go},
but the traffic {\*coming at you }just keeps coming.

189
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,035
And even when the light turns red,
a guy in a BMW runs the red light.

190
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,704
So you can't make your left turn.
What goes through your mind?

191
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,081
Fag.

192
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,460
Right. But you're not thinking
"he's homosexual",

193
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,420
you're thinking "he's an inconsiderate
douchebag like a Harley rider."

194
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,675
This... this is making
insanely good sense to me.

195
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,386
All right.
What would you call a straight man

196
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,888
who doesn't own a Harley,

197
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,306
but likes them
and might buy one someday.

198
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,016
You call him bike curious.

199
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,519
- Bike...
- Bike curious!

200
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,479
Don't you{\ people} keep up
with today's lingo at all?

201
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,736
Fellow homosexuals.

202
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,196
I believe we have
an opportunity here

203
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,033
to take a big step forward
for our kind.

204
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,077
We must acknowledge that the words

205
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,497
fag and faggot
are never going to disappear.

206
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,666
They are simply too much fun
for everyone to say.

207
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,754
We must realize that we are no longer
the most hated people on the planet.

208
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,965
And help the children change
the meaning of the word

209
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,635
to describe those annoying,
loud, faggot Harley riders!

210
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,221
Here, here!

211
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,391
We should all be tolerant
but not with these fucking people.

212
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:31,185
They really are faggots.

213
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,353
Yes!
Jesus, yes!

214
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,856
<i>This is Channel 4 evening news.</i>

215
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:40,361
A new movement in South Park
is bringing to question the word "fag".

216
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:44,323
Gay groups are pointing out
that {\*the word}it no longer means to kids today,

217
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,408
what it meant just a few years ago.

218
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,619
And what's your name little boy?

219
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,037
Martin.

220
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,872
All right, Martin.
Can you do me a favor?

221
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,333
Could you point to the fag for me?

222
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,712
Just point to which one is the fag.

223
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,720
Could you just point
to the fag for me, little girl?

224
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,514
Which one is a faggot?

225
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,605
<i>Sparked by this realization,
and persuaded by gay advocate groups,</i>

226
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,774
<i>the mayor signed
a new city ordinance today,</i>

227
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,401
<i>making the word fag officially refer</i>

228
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,279
<i>to annoying,
inconsiderate Harley riders.</i>

229
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,492
How do you fags feel
about the new city ordinance?

230
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,911
What did you say?

231
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,623
Just asking if you feel okay
or displeased about the ordinance, fag.

232
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,292
You know what?

233
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,460
If you call me fag
to my face one more time,

234
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:40,087
- you better...
- I {\already }did it twice.

235
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,213
I think that...

236
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,757
I think that you probably
you won't say it again.

237
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:44,884
I bet I do.

238
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,385
- Okay.
- Fag.

239
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:51,640
<i>As more people in South Park
adapt to the new meaning...</i>

240
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,393
Fags!

241
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:00,316
<i>More and more Harley riders
are deciding to ride elsewhere.</i>

242
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,942
{\$GOD HATES FAGS}

243
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,737
Nice, Kenny.

244
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,324
Isn't this awesome, you guys?
I haven't seen a Harley for {\*like }three days!

245
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,659
I know!
{\*It's like }We have the outdoors back again!

246
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,871
You four turdballs,
in my office. Now!

247
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,041
Crap.

248
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,960
You have gotten me
in a lot of trouble!

249
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,672
<i>The fact of the matter is that fag
is still defined</i>

250
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:27,551
<i>in the dictionary as a pejorative term
against homosexuals.</i>

251
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,971
<i>And so you are still causing harm
to gay people everywhere,</i>

252
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,349
<i>whether you mean it
differently or not.</i>

253
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,310
<i>The town of South Park and its mayor
have once again shown themselves</i>

254
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,979
<i>to be completely out of touch
with the progressive world.</i>

255
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:41,607
She's gaining support
all over the country!

256
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,191
I shouldn't have {\*never }listened to you!

257
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,819
- We're sorry, mayor.
- That's nice.

258
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:49,657
You made our entire town look like
gaybashing redneck homophobes,

259
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,283
but at least you're sorry!

260
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,118
- We can fix this!
- How?

261
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,830
{\*That lady}She said it's because fag still means
homosexual in the dictionary.

262
00:15:56,955 --> 00:16:00,000
So we just have to convince {\*the dictionary }people
to change the definition.

263
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,546
Then people would be free to call
Harley riders fags all over the country!

264
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,807
{\*Now, }I don't know about you,
but {\*I think }this town is starting a trend.

265
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,643
And if we let them officially change
the meaning of fag

266
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:21,313
from gay people to us,
then soon every town might!

267
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:28,194
If we don't do anything
we could end up...

268
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,656
If we don't do anything we could...

269
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,034
Bartlett!

270
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,579
I'm trying to talk, you fag!

271
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,002
See!
{\*Now, }They got us doing it to ourselves!

272
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,753
We gotta put a stop to this now!

273
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,673
So I say we ride into that town
and kick some fucking ass!

274
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:06,525
{\pub}Excitement is in the air,
as the citizens of South Park amass

275
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,028
to see if the word fag
will officially

276
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,404
be changed
in the English dictionary.

277
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,367
Four local boys will state their case
to the head dictionary editor,

278
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,744
and if they succeed

279
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,080
fag will officially refer
to Harley riders nationwide.

280
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,083
You can do it, boys!
We believe in you!

281
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,419
And Tom, it looks as though
the dictionary officials have arrived!

282
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,424
Entering the scene now are the keepers
of the current dictionary,

283
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,177
and of course,
the dictionary's head editor...

284
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,761
Mr. Emmanuel Lewis.

285
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:39,474
- Emmanuel Lewis, huh?
- It all makes sense now.

286
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,229
To change...

287
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,773
the definition of a word...

288
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,650
is no trifling thing!

289
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:53,655
I expect this proposal,
for changing the definition of {\*the word }fag,

290
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,950
to be both
discerning and undisputable.

291
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,786
Come on boys, you can do it!

292
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,962
Look out!
There's a bunch of pissed off faggots!

293
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,022
- There's fags everywhere!
- We gotta run!

294
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,532
What nefariousness is this?

295
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,077
You obdurate beasts!

296
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,598
Now, do you think we're fags?

297
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,228
- Yes, sir, you are total fags!
- You definitely made your point.

298
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,316
We rolled in,
kicked ass and took shit over.

299
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,735
Is that what a fag does?

300
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,904
That's totally what a fag does!

301
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,448
You're supposed to think
we're not fags, now!

302
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,119
{\*But then }Why are you acting like such fags?
I don't understand!

303
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,705
- I don't either.
- That's because you {\*guys }never understood!

304
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,754
You fellers never got
what these people are really about!

305
00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:35,757
Freedom!
Rebellion against the system!

306
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:38,051
A living image of independence!

307
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:41,054
Solid, defiant and supremely cool,

308
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:43,390
the biker is an all-American icon

309
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,392
of resilient individuality

310
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,852
and freedom!

311
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,770
Who is this little fag?

312
00:19:48,895 --> 00:19:52,065
I'm not a fag yet, sir,
but I am bike curious.

313
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,900
That's it!
Let's kill 'em all!

314
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,320
That'll just make you bigger fags!

315
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,197
No one is killing anyone!

316
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,201
We've had enough.

317
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,955
You faggots
get the hell out of our town.

318
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,168
All right, everyone.
All right.

319
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,669
We are fags.

320
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,337
Yeah, {\*we're fags}we are.

321
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,423
We're total fags.
And you know what?

322
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,259
We like it.

323
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,221
We like being fags.

324
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,433
So go ahead, America.

325
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,185
Whenever you pass by
Harley riders like us,

326
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,773
roll down your window,
and yell "Faggots!"

327
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,692
All you kids out there,
when you see us,

328
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:39,112
walk up to us,
and say "Hello, fags!"

329
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,698
No, really.
We want you to.

330
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,410
At least, we're cool enough
to embrace who we are.

331
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,913
- Right, guys?
- That's right!

332
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,748
You got it!

333
00:20:50,665 --> 00:20:52,667
Come on, fags.
Let's roll out!

334
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,804
And that, Mr. Editor,

335
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,639
is why they are
