00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,874
<i>Good morning, South Park Elementary.
These are the morning announcements.</i>

3
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,168
<i>Parent/teacher conferences
begin next Thursday.</i>

4
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,212
<i>If you have not yet done so,
{\*please }turn in your parents' {\*requested }time sheets</i>

5
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,922
<i>by the end of fifth period today.</i>

6
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,675
<i>Lunch today
will be a choice of chicken tostadas</i>

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,260
<i>or spaghetti
with a marinara sauce and side salad.</i>

8
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,138
<i>Attention fourth graders,</i>

9
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,849
<i>the fall registration
for glee club starts tomorrow.</i>

10
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,185
<i>Any interested students
should fill out a...</i>

11
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,229
- <i>What's going on?</i>
- <i>I'll kill you!</i>

12
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,857
- <i>I swear to God, I'll kill you!</i>
- <i>Who are you?</i>

13
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,777
<i>I'm the man who's going to put a bullet
between yours eyes!</i>

14
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,529
- <i>He's got a gun!</i>
- <i>You little bastard!</i>

15
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,616
<i>You fucked my wife!
You think I wouldn't find out?</i>

16
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,868
- <i>{\*Sir, }Please, I don't know you.</i>
- <i>Yeah, right!</i>

17
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:20,079
<i>What the hell is going on here?
You, sir, need to leave this area...</i>

18
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,332
<i>Oh God!
He shot him!</i>

19
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,084
<i>You had to push me, didn't you?
Now you!</i>

20
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,212
<i>Sir, I truly don't know...</i>

21
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,799
<i>There!
How does it feel, huh?</i>

22
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,009
<i>Please!
I don't know you!</i>

23
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,930
<i>Gordon Saltski, right?
Truck driver from Chicago?</i>

24
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,765
<i>No, I'm Gordon Stoltski!</i>

25
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,017
<i>Third grader
{\*who reads }of the morning announcements!</i>

26
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,310
<i>Yeah right!
We'll see if that's true!</i>

27
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,522
<i>Go on,
read the morning announcements!</i>

28
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,982
- <i>Somebody help me!</i>
- <i>I said do it!</i>

29
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,447
<i>Any interested students...</i>

30
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,658
<i>should fill out
an applicant survey...</i>

31
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,620
<i>I knew you were lying!
That was terrible!</i>

32
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,373
<i>Now put your mouth
over the barrel of this gun.</i>

33
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,501
<i>No please... I'm so scared.
I'm so scared.</i>

34
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,044
- <i>Do it!</i>
- <i>Please!</i>

35
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,089
<i>I'll do whatever you say...
Here, see?</i>

36
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,466
<i>I got my mouth on the barrel...</i>

37
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,387
<i>Look at you now.</i>

38
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,222
<i>We're all dead!</i>

39
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,727
{\$IN LOVING MEMORY}

40
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,520
We will always remember the way

41
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,648
that Gordon bravely read
the announcements every morning.

42
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,941
Lead us
in the pledge of allegiance, m'kay,

43
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,778
and touched
many kids' lives here at the school.

44
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:36,990
And even though we now know
that the shooter had him confused

45
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,910
with a 40-year-old truck driver
who happened to have a similar name,

46
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,872
I know this has been
pretty traumatizing, m'kay.

47
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,458
Now we must decide
who will pick up where {\*little }Gordon left off.

48
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,211
Who will take his place
reading the morning announcements.

49
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,297
It is a big responsibility.

50
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,176
Because it will be your voice
the entire school listens to, m'kay.

51
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,804
And although Gordon Stoltski
can never be replaced, m'kay,

52
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,933
there must be a student out there
who has the drive and the passion to...

53
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,018
have his or her voice heard
every morning.

54
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,980
Oh my God!

55
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,566
{\$MORNING ANNOUCEMENT TRYOUTS}

56
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:17,530
So you're trying out to be
the morning announcements person{\* as well}?

57
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,075
I think it would be really... fun...

58
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,535
and...

59
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,788
raise my self... esteem.

60
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,416
This is it, huh?

61
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,920
Mike,
why don't we have you try out first?

62
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,424
He stutters like a bitch!
I've got this job in the bag!

63
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:41,930
Who are you?

64
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,934
My name is Casey Miller
and I'm in the third grade.

65
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,062
Ever since I can remember,
people have told me

66
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:52,440
I should read the {\*morning }announcements.
My friends always said to me,

67
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,527
"Dear Casey,
your voice is like butter to our ears.

68
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:59,197
"{\*Could you }Please find a way to get
that audible chocolate on the airwaves.{\*?}"

69
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,490
Well, here I am.

70
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,326
And hopefully
I'll be the kid with the job.

71
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,663
M'kay, really nice, Mike.

72
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,248
Maybe next time
you can get past the first word.

73
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,793
Casey Miller, good.
You're trying out, too?

74
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,378
I'm trying out and drying out

75
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,172
in the sultry summer sun
that is my voice.

76
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,633
M'kay, Eric.
You wanna go next?

77
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:28,685
M'kay, Eric.
I'{\*m just gonna }ll just have you read this {\*piece of }paper.

78
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,939
Mr. Mackey,
what's a moronic jiz rag?

79
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,566
What?
What {\*on earth }are you askin' me that for?

80
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:36,985
It's just...

81
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,403
that's what that Casey kid
said about your hair piece.

82
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,240
Get lost you little dirt ball!

83
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,408
- Excuse me?
- I said take a hike!

84
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,744
I don't understand what I did wrong.

85
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,205
Beat it.
You're not getting the job!

86
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,964
<i>Good morning{\*, South Park Elementary}.
These are the morning announcements.</i>

87
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,092
And I am Eric Cartman.

88
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,220
All forms for the school book drive
must be handed in to Mr. Davis

89
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,764
in the library
by the end of the school day today.

90
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,517
Doesn't seem like
they gave us a lot of notice on that.

91
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,643
Oh, well.

92
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,439
For lunch today, the cafeteria
will be serving {\*a selection of }cold sandwiches.

93
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,108
Cold sandwiches.
Oh, well. Thank you so much.

94
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,904
Remember when we {\*used to be served}had hot food?
{\I mean, }What has happened to our school?

95
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,073
This school is transforming
into something very bad and why?

96
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,284
Because we have leadership
that doesn't care.

97
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,745
I'm talking{\*of course}
about our student body president.

98
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,954
Wendy Testaburger.

99
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,042
<i>Ever since Wendy was elected{\* student body president},
this school has started a rapid decline</i>

100
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,712
<i>towards some socialist regime
where students no longer have a voice.</i>

101
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,132
<i>The music room will be closed off today
due to painting.</i>

102
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,302
<i>All students in band or choir
will meet in the gymnasium instead.</i>

103
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,263
<i>So, now the school is using money
to paint the music room.</i>

104
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,348
<i>How old{\* and outdated} is our playground equipment?</i>

105
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,310
What other school
has a 15-year-old merry-go-round on it?

106
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,813
Our {\*school }president is turning this {\*whole }place
into communist Russia.

107
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,274
<i>It's {\*not a }no coincidence
that once {\*Wendy }she took office</i>

108
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,526
<i>this school started
coming apart at the seams.</i>

109
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,320
<i>Teachers don't {\want to }tell you,
they're scared</i>

110
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,280
<i>and they should be
because the very fabric</i>

111
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,658
<i>of this elementary school
is tearing from all corners.</i>

112
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,784
Oh jeez!

113
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,995
<i>I'm just a normal kid,
like you except that I ask questions.</i>

114
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,207
<i>I'm brave enough to ask questions,
so I come under scrutinies.</i>

115
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,709
<i>Is Wendy using your lunch money
to buy heroin?</i>

116
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,544
<i>Probably not.
But how can we know?</i>

117
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,505
<i>I don't want my lunch money
going to drugs.</i>

118
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,507
<i>Who's taking to{\these drugs}?
What would be the point?</i>

119
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,426
- <i>I'm asking questions.</i>
- Will somebody shut him up?

120
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,845
You wanted to see me{\, principal victoria}?

121
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,807
The job is to read
what is written on the paper, Eric,

122
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,516
not to embellish the way you do.

123
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,186
I get it.
You're trying to silence me!

124
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,732
You're scared that we{\somebody is} standing up here{\to this school}
and its president for once!

125
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,235
It's {\just }that the announcements
need to be quick

126
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,236
so the students
can get on with their work!

127
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,405
Really?

128
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,240
{\*How come }Why Gordon Stolski got to go on
for like 5 minutes that one day?

129
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,535
Well, because he was being murdered.

130
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,705
You want somebody to read
what's in front of them{\ like a brain washed zombie}, is that it?

131
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,958
I am not Gordon Stolski, okay?

132
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,669
I'm not some dog a leash
that just blindly says what he's told,

133
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,045
until he's killed.

134
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,674
- All we ask is you keep it shorter.
- Oh, I will.

135
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,385
And maybe I'll also
have a word with the A.C.L.U.

136
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,930
Tell them that a student is being told
not to speak out against is school.

137
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,015
I'm sure they'll find
that very interesting.

138
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,569
<i>Good morning, South Park Elementary.</i>

139
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,279
<i>These are the morning announcements.</i>

140
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,157
<i>Tryouts for the soccer team
are Friday{\ afternoon}. That's, of course,</i>

141
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,326
<i>if our {\student body }president does something
about our abysmal soccer field.</i>

142
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,661
<i>I've a question.</i>

143
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,997
<i>What does Wendy{\ Testaburger} actually do?
She's {\supposed to be }our president, right?</i>

144
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,250
What is her agenda?
She's lying to everyone!

145
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,751
Or is she?
Let's ask{\* these questions}.

146
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,546
{\Today }I want to talk briefly
about {\*the state of }our school's economy.

147
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,965
The bake sale last week
was a complete failure.

148
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,801
And besides that,
who voted for Wendy Testaburger?

149
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,179
{\I know }I didn't. {\*And everyone}Those who did
{\*is }are now scratching their heads

150
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,097
and going oops!
{\Guess }I shouldn't have done that.

151
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:56,350
I'm not in student council.
I'm just a normal kid like all of you.

152
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:59,144
And{\ like all of you}, I want to know
what has happened to my school!

153
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:01,355
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

154
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,191
of the United States of America.

155
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:07,027
Ours{\ United States}, not the one Wendy{\* Testaburger} would have,
a socialist dung hole.

156
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,197
A socialist dung hole...

157
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,452
<i>Good morning{\, students}.
These are the morning announcements.</i>

158
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,538
<i>If you will direct your attention
to the new video monitors{\ at the head of your class}.</i>

159
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,124
<i>You'll see that it{\the announcements}
are now being done in video.</i>

160
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,792
Oh God. No!

161
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,763
Lunch today is going to be pizza.

162
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:34,889
Again.

163
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,975
Friends,
our school is dying and you know it.

164
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,102
You feel it.

165
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,062
You're like me you wanna change it.

166
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,897
But no, Wendy Testaburger's
not gonna let that happen.

167
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,567
This is not
the school we grew up in and...

168
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,569
I don't know if we can get it back.

169
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,656
So {\let's take a look at exactly }what our school president wants.

170
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,533
{\You know, }What is she trying to achieve?

171
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,409
{\Let's just }Take a look at these key words.

172
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:57,703
Wendy {\has made it clear that she }wants our school
to be a more integrated,

173
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,371
leftist and liberal place.

174
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,457
<i>But you see
when that happens what we get</i>

175
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,585
is a Socialist
modern Utopian reformed

176
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,045
farce of a school.

177
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,338
<i>When you look closely
it's{\ becomes} very obvious</i>

178
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,799
what Wendy wants.

179
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,219
K- I-l-l s-m-u-r-f-s.

180
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,930
Our school president

181
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,640
wants to kill Smurfs.

182
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,145
Don't know if we're turning
into a Smurf hating school or what{\ we're turning into}.

183
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,816
But unless you ask why,
we're gonna transform into something.

184
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,361
Is it true?

185
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,448
- Is what true?
- That you hate Smurfs!

186
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:36,700
I don't have time{\ for this}.

187
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,578
Now, me and us fellers
are just asking questions!

188
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:42,665
Try to understand this.

189
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,876
All I do is try
to help run student council.

190
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,836
I don't give a crap about Smurfs!

191
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,838
It is true!

192
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,798
- Oh my God!
- She admitted it!

193
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,302
Maybe you {\guys }should check
into what student council actually does

194
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,596
before you {\just }blindly listen
to what some idiot {\with a microphone }tells you!

195
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,101
What did the Smurfs ever do to you?
Ya bitch!

196
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,729
I just called the president a bitch!

197
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,689
- That was cool!
- Awesome.

198
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:16,866
{\pub}Thank you, and this is to...

199
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,326
- Douglas.
- To Douglas, there you go.

200
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,037
Book signing today{\, everyone}.
Be sure to pick up your copy.

201
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,125
Another person who cares
about the future of our school!

202
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,169
You bet!

203
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,463
I love all{\ the stuff} you said
about how our school president

204
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,215
never does anything!
And how she's changing everything!

205
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,177
Now you can read
about all the things I've said.

206
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,930
- Take this copy of my book.
- Cool, thanks!

207
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,222
That'll be $5.

208
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,518
- What{\ the hell} do you think you're doing?
- A book signing.

209
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,103
I looked through it{\your stupid book}!

210
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,981
It's 540 pages of ripping on Wendy
and calling her a slut!

211
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,983
I do not directly say she's a slut.

212
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,111
"Wendy Testaburger
has proven time and time again

213
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,364
"that she will do anything
to pleasure her vagina.

214
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,075
{\Whether it is }"School football team or the janitor's
on their break, Wendy spends her time

215
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,078
"as president on her knees
or on her back

216
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,912
"taking the ol' in out
for hours on end."

217
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,165
You didn't read the rest, dude.

218
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,292
- Or does she.
- Or does she?

219
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,253
See, that's a question.
I'm asking questions, Stan!

220
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,256
I've called for Wendy to come{\ on my show}
{\and }defend herself, but she won't do it.

221
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,550
Yeah, and she hates Smurfs!

222
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,762
"Shouldn't we be worried
if our school president is a girl

223
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:23,224
"who would rather get her tits licked
than go to student council meetings?"

224
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,185
- Stop reading that!
- What do you mean?

225
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,690
{\listen, Just because }A guy's voice is on the intercom
and his words are in a book

226
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,733
doesn't mean he knows{\has any idea}
what he's talking about!

227
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,402
Yes, it does.

228
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,280
Eric Cartman is simply making it
so that all kids take the responsibility

229
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:40,199
to question their school leaders.

230
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,034
We should all ask if our president

231
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,912
is a penis hungry hooker
with a huge vagina.

232
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,414
I'm Casey Miller.

233
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,420
Did you see the stuff Cartman
is saying about you{\ now}?

234
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,464
- I really don't care.
- {\Don't you think }You should go{\ on his show} and defend yourself.

235
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,550
Everyone{\ is starting to} think
you're a crappy president.

236
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,053
I'm not giving Eric Fartman
one minute of my time, you got that?

237
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,972
I'm not acknowledging
his stupid questions.

238
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,349
If you want him dealt with,{\ you'll have to}
do it yourself.

239
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,063
You wanted to see me again?

240
00:12:11,438 --> 00:12:13,649
Eric, we've been informed
by a concerned student

241
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,443
that you're writing naughty books
about a girl{\one of the girls here} at the school.

242
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:20,280
{\Wendy came and}She told on me? 'cause she's president
she can't be written about?

243
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,242
Eric, apparently you wrote
that Wendy's private parts

244
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,411
are big enough
to fly an airplane through.

245
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:26,954
{\And }What if they are?

246
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,331
You'll stop me from asking
{\just }because she forces you to?

247
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:32,209
The student body president{\ really}
doesn't have the kind of power that...

248
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,795
{\just }Enough power to force you
to stop me from selling my book.

249
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,839
Face it. You're a lackey, Mackey.

250
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,758
I've had enough!

251
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:42,595
You cannot and you will not sell
your books on school grounds.

252
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,012
Do I make myself clear?

253
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,556
Clear as summer rain.

254
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,808
Clear as a flavorless bottle
of vitamin water!

255
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,352
This school has {\finally }transformed
into the socialist whore land

256
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:51,770
where a student isn't free.

257
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,440
I'm not going to be a part of it.
Do you understand?

258
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,234
I am leaving
this hypocritical communist school!

259
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,778
I am walking out
and I am never coming back!

260
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,329
<i>Live from the principal's office.</i>

261
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,205
<i>These are the morning announcements.</i>

262
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,416
<i>Here, is Eric Cartman.</i>

263
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,461
Yesterday, as most of you know,

264
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,005
I walked out on this program
and on our school.

265
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,591
I was so, fed up
with our president's hypocrisies,

266
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,593
me not being allowed
to sell my book.

267
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,805
I wanted to live in a place
where my values were still upheld.

268
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,766
So I decided to leave it all behind
and instead go and live...

269
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,184
with the Smurfs.

270
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,813
<i>I simply observed
the gentle Smurfs at first.</i>

271
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,523
<i>{\I wanted }To understand how they could live
such simple and decent lives.</i>

272
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:41,027
<i>They were wary of me at the beginning,</i>
<i>but slowly, I began to earn their trust.</i>

273
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,949
<i>It wasn't long
before the gentle Smurfs accepted me{\ as one of their own}.</i>

274
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,085
<i>{\The Smurfs and I}We grew to understand each other.</i>

275
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,211
<i>They taught{\shared with} me
{\their}the art of picking smurfberries.</i>

276
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,339
<i>And I taught{\shared with} them
stories of my country's forefathers.</i>

277
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,508
<i>{\Of course}But, it wasn't long before...</i>

278
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,011
<i>I fell in love with Smurfette.</i>

279
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,055
<i>We were {\from 2 }different{\ worlds} and yet,
we spoke the language of passion.</i>

280
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:11,475
These are the {\*morning }announcements?

281
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,269
<i>Poppa Smurf was displeased at first.</i>

282
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,230
<i>He told Smurfette I wasn't a Smurf
and we could never be happy.</i>

283
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,609
<i>I proved myself to Poppa Smurf
by picking more smurfberries</i>

284
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,277
<i>than any Smurf had ever smurfed{\ before}.</i>

285
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,112
<i>Finally, all was right{\ with the world}.</i>

286
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,699
<i>But then... a crisis.</i>

287
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:30,786
<i>Clumsy Smurf burst</i>{\into the Smurf ceremony } <i>to say
that humans {\had come to }gonna destroy Smurfland.</i>

288
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,748
No you must leave
the noble Smurfs alone!

289
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,667
Who is behind all this?

290
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,586
I should have known!
Wendy!

291
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,296
Out of my way!

292
00:14:41,588 --> 00:14:42,756
What are you doing{\ here}?

293
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,384
Smurfberries
are worth a lot of money.

294
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,052
With all those smurfberries

295
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,721
I can power the school
for the entire year!

296
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,433
Wendy, I know you're the president{\ of our school}.
But you can't do this{\just dig up the smurfs land}!

297
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,436
Fuck the Smurfs!
They can suck my fat tits.

298
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,690
How many smurfberries is enough?

299
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,152
You can suck my fat tits too.

300
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,665
Smurfette no!

301
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,751
Suck my fat tits!

302
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:26,383
{\And so }Now our school has plenty of precious,
unobtainable smurf berries.

303
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,677
Well, big deal.

304
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,971
At what cost
did our school president get it?

305
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,848
Every Smurf is dead.

306
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,226
Wiped out
and we will never see them again.

307
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,269
Go on, look outside.
You won't see any Smurfs.

308
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,690
{\Of course, }Since I'm being silenced

309
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,984
I'm not allowed time
to show you the entire movie.

310
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,820
So please buy <i>Dances with Smurfs</i>
available now on DVD.

311
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,365
The question now
is what happened to morals?

312
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,118
What happened to dignity?
What happened to my school?

313
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,372
That does it!

314
00:15:56,663 --> 00:15:59,833
Our student council is corrupt
and has to be dealt with!

315
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,460
I can no longer stand idly by.

316
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,713
We need to get all the kids
who want to fight back

317
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,506
and tell them to meet after school!

318
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,425
We will forever remember this day,

319
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,344
the day we finally stood up
to Wendy Testaburger!

320
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,181
It is time
for that slutty smurf killing bitch

321
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,724
to get what's coming to her.

322
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,815
{\pub}I don't know about all of you,

323
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,399
but I have had enough!

324
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:27,403
We've been sitting back
and watching as our school

325
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,071
slowly goes into the toilet!

326
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,448
But today, we do something about it!

327
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,577
So let's march right on over
to Wendy's house,

328
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:37,788
and do what we know
needs to be done!

329
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:49,883
Let us not forget
what happens this day!

330
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,385
Do it!

331
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,387
We are here, Wendy Testaburger!

332
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,188
- Take that, school president!
- Get her good!

333
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,356
I am.

334
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,402
- Hey! What are you doing?
- The students want answers!

335
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,573
Go on the morning announcements
if you've got nothing to hide!

336
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,408
What the hell?

337
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:19,913
Smurf killer!

338
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,834
Answer for your crimes
on the morning announcements!

339
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:27,796
Wendy? Did a boy just pee on our door
because the smurfs were murdered?

340
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,799
It's okay dad.
I'll take care of it.

341
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,345
Thank you so much
for finally coming on my show.

342
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,722
Well, Butters peed on my house.

343
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,141
People are riled up.

344
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,185
Hopefully we can clear the air here.

345
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,645
If we could {\*just }keep it to questions
about student council.

346
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,065
- Of course. That's why we're here.
- Five seconds.

347
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,691
Don't worry.
I won't go too hard.

348
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,739
Good morning South Park Elementary.
These are the morning announcements.

349
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,824
Rehearsals for the school play
are canceled.

350
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,660
For lunch the cafeteria will be
serving meat loaf or veggie pasta.

351
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,623
My guest today is the student president
of South Park Elementary, Wendy.

352
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:05,208
- Thank you for coming on the show.
- Sure.

353
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:09,087
I'll start by asking a straight question
and I hope you won't take offense to it.

354
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:13,008
How many smurfberries is the life
of each smurf worth?

355
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,389
I don't... I...
I have no idea what...

356
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,434
You don't know how many smurfberries
the life of each smurf is worth?

357
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:24,769
He's got her now!

358
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,272
<i>Would you agree that the school
is in a crisis?</i>

359
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,482
There's a few things wrong
with the school, but...

360
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,527
If a smurf dies and no one is around
to hear it, does it still scream?

361
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,533
- She's speechless!
- You're the president

362
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,743
<i>Can you see why many students
think you're an slut?</i>

363
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,913
Are you suggesting
{\*that }the smurf holocaust never happened?

364
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,541
Look, Eric!
You have to understand,

365
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,085
the smurfberries were
our school government's only option!

366
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,753
Yes, and that makes...
Wait. What?

367
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,966
What was I suppose to do?
The school was running out of power!

368
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,760
We tried relocating the smurfs at first,
but they wouldn't budge.

369
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,846
So we decided to get somebody
on the inside.

370
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,474
A member of the school who could act
like them and learn their secrets.

371
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,811
- But you already knew that don't you?
- What do you mean I know that?

372
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,396
I'm just asking the question.

373
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,815
We knew you were sent in
to live with the smurfs, but

374
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,691
did you know
they would be wiped out?

375
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,109
You wiped them all out!

376
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:15,988
Nobody expected you
to fall in love with smurfette!

377
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,491
You went to learn from them,
but instead you became one of them.{\* Right?}

378
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:23,162
Fought against your own kind!
When you knew we'd stop at nothing.

379
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,623
Do you know that one smurfberry
can power the school for two months?

380
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,375
One smurfberry!

381
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:32,545
- Wait. Hold on. Can we take a break?
- No. It's all out in the open now.

382
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:36,008
<i>I wouldn't have had to kill the smurfs
if they would have simply moved on,</i>

383
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,926
<i>but you gave them the will to stay.</i>

384
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,304
<i>And I guess
you can't be blamed for that.</i>

385
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,263
What?

386
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,058
And that is why I am stepping down.

387
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:46,894
You were right all along, Cartman.

388
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,604
And I am here by making you
the student body president.

389
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,482
Alright! Cartman's president!
We did it!

390
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,275
I'm confused.

391
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,820
You can't take
my <i>Dances with Smurfs</i> idea, and...

392
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,781
No, you're right. The students
all deserve to know the truth.

393
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:02,576
And so I have answered
what really happened in my new book

394
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,328
<i>Going rogue on the Smurfs</i>.

395
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,707
You don't {\*just }take one person's story
{\*and }then add things and call it yours!

396
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:12,085
Luckily, with the money I made selling
the movie rights to my book, I'll be OK.

397
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,421
- You sold the movie rights to who?
- James Cameron.

398
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,214
Go look, the movie came out already!

399
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,967
They can't do that!
I'm student body president!

400
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:24,014
God dammit!

401
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,309
Son of a bitch
idea-stealing assholes!

402
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:31,104
You sons of bitches!
<i>Dances with Smurfs</i> was my idea!

403
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:32,814
My idea!

404
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,028
You can't just take <i>Dances with Smurfs</i>
and call it something else!

405
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,164
What? You're not doing
the {\*morning }announcements anymore?

406
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,458
No, because it turns out
that by rule,

407
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,503
the {\*student body }school president can't also be
the morning announcement reader.

408
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,214
At least as president, you can run
the school the way you want.

409
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,133
I can't do jack! I went
to my first student council meeting,

410
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:03,303
all we did was talk about what colors
to make the {\*stupid }Sadie Hawkins dance!

411
00:21:03,678 --> 00:21:05,180
Student council's retarded!

412
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,600
<i>The sun is up
and the birds are chirping.</i>

413
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:12,271
<i>I'm Casey Miller and these
are the morning announcements.</i>

414
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,857
<i>I have a letter from second-grade
student Brian Falner. Brian writes,</i>

415
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,192
<i>"Dear Casey,</i>

416
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:20,195
<i>"why is our school president
such a fat stupid dickhead?</i>

417
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:24,241
<i>"My desk is broken, and so far
Eric Cartman has done nothing about it.</i>

418
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:28,453
<i>"Will you {\*please }let that {\*walking }bowl of anus pus
know that we are not happy?"</i>

419
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,788
<i>Well, I couldn't agree more.</i>

420
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,459
<i>Our asshole president
is a fat smelly douchebag milkshake.</i>

421
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,045
I'm doing the best I can!

422
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:45,512
