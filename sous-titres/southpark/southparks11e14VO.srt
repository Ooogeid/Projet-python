South Park - Season 11 Episode 14
"The List"

2
00:00:34,783 --> 00:00:36,430
Fellas! Fellas!

3
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:39,242
It's- Oh my God!
You're not gonna believe this!

4
00:00:39,503 --> 00:00:42,203
- Dude, Butters, calm down.
- Okay. Okay.

5
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:45,584
I was talking to Pete Wetchney,
and he said that Danny Chadwick

6
00:00:45,784 --> 00:00:50,014
said that his sister told him that
the girls in our class have a list

7
00:00:50,214 --> 00:00:53,648
that rates every boy's looks
from cutest to ugliest.

8
00:00:55,114 --> 00:00:57,535
- So who do they say is the cutest?
- I dunno.

9
00:00:57,735 --> 00:01:00,245
- Who do they say is the ugliest?
- I don't know.

10
00:01:00,445 --> 00:01:04,445
It's like a girl thing. They won't let
anybody see the list but them.

11
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:11,437
They can't do that. Who are they
to judge us on how we look?

12
00:01:11,557 --> 00:01:13,304
Yeah. You think they
rate us just for looks,

13
00:01:13,424 --> 00:01:14,903
or they take personality into account?

14
00:01:15,164 --> 00:01:16,905
If it's just looks
then I think I'm safe.

15
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,103
You guys, who cares if the girls
make some stupid list?

16
00:01:19,223 --> 00:01:20,617
Girls make dumb lists all the time.

17
00:01:21,137 --> 00:01:23,495
Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it;
we have better things to worry about.

18
00:01:23,756 --> 00:01:26,456
You're just saying that because you know
you're gonna be very last on the list!

19
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:30,168
Oh please, I don't think so, Craig!
Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!

20
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:32,379
You don't think they put
the fat tub of lard at the bottom?

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,645
No, because people know
I'm not fat! I'm buff.

22
00:01:34,765 --> 00:01:36,232
They probably put you
at the bottom of the list

23
00:01:36,352 --> 00:01:38,885
because you have fucked up teeth!
Or Kenny 'cause he's poor.

24
00:01:39,146 --> 00:01:41,262
(They didn't put me
at the bottom, did they?)

25
00:01:41,523 --> 00:01:43,165
Kenny, face it:
Girls don't wanna Pop-Tarts

26
00:01:43,285 --> 00:01:44,766
for dinner every night
when they get married.

27
00:01:45,027 --> 00:01:47,445
You don't think they said I'm the
ugliest boy in the class, do ya?

28
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,322
Well if they did,
my parents will ground me.

29
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,932
You guys, do you really care

30
00:01:51,052 --> 00:01:53,316
what a bunch of girls have to say
about how you rank in looks?!

31
00:01:58,707 --> 00:02:00,695
- All right, Bebe, let's see the list.
- What??

32
00:02:00,815 --> 00:02:02,220
You know what I'm talking about, bitch!

33
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,202
The list where you rate the looks
of each boy in the class!

34
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:08,081
That's not for boys to look at! It's a
secret girl list and you can't see it!

35
00:02:08,342 --> 00:02:09,405
Craig is on the bottom, right?

36
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:11,584
Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating
Pop-Tarts for dinner if you married him.

37
00:02:11,845 --> 00:02:13,419
I'm not... telling!

38
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:15,925
And anyway, I'm not
the list keeper, Nelly is!

39
00:02:16,045 --> 00:02:19,095
And Nelly will never
let you look at it, so there!

40
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:26,017
Fuck you Bebe! Fuck you bitch!

41
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:29,586
Well, I guess we're never
gonna get that list from the girls.

42
00:02:29,706 --> 00:02:31,888
Screw that, dude! We're guys.

43
00:02:32,168 --> 00:02:33,718
We can outthink them.

44
00:02:36,643 --> 00:02:37,825
All right, here's what we know.

45
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:40,363
That chick Nelly is the one who's
in charge of holding the list, right?

46
00:02:40,624 --> 00:02:42,532
She apparently keeps it
in a purple Pee Chee folder.

47
00:02:42,793 --> 00:02:44,274
We need a plan to get it from her.

48
00:02:44,394 --> 00:02:47,245
This is what I call
"Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail."

49
00:02:47,538 --> 00:02:48,538
Neato!

50
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:51,596
At 1 p.m. tomorrow, Nelly will have
to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies.

51
00:02:51,716 --> 00:02:54,573
That's our best time to strike.
As she makes her way through Hallway 3,

52
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:56,922
Craig will be ready with
a distraction device here.

53
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:58,864
When she stops and turns
to Craig in the hallway,

54
00:02:58,984 --> 00:03:01,885
Butters will run up
and kick her in the balls.

55
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:03,219
Okay!

56
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,516
Once Butters kicks her in the balls,

57
00:03:04,636 --> 00:03:06,533
she'll fall to the floor,
dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny

58
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:10,059
will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta,
and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?

59
00:03:20,502 --> 00:03:22,202
What'd you do that for?!

60
00:03:24,157 --> 00:03:26,367
Hey, what's your problem, asshole?!

61
00:03:26,862 --> 00:03:27,912
Bail, bail!

62
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:32,600
Okay, our mission failed,
but we've learned a lot.

63
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,959
Primarily that girls do not have balls.

64
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:37,127
They sure don't.

65
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:39,120
Never mind, because
we are going to Plan B,

66
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,356
one that I call "Operation:
Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time."

67
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,898
When Nelly leaves
the cafeteria for recess,

68
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:45,595
Kenny will jump in front of her
and spit on the ground.

69
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:48,515
You think maybe girls keep their balls
on the inside of their tummies?

70
00:03:48,776 --> 00:03:52,101
Butters, we're done talkin' about
girls' balls right now! Pay attention!

71
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:54,853
<i>South Park Elementary</i>

72
00:03:56,914 --> 00:03:59,650
We got it! We got it!

73
00:03:59,912 --> 00:04:01,962
We got the list from the girls!

74
00:04:03,474 --> 00:04:05,573
Give that back you dirty buttholes!

75
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,701
Tape it to the wall, Kenny!
Jason, watch the door!

76
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:10,453
All right, hurry!
Get it up there! Let's see it!

77
00:04:10,714 --> 00:04:13,024
Hurry hurry! What's this thing? Where
am I? What number am I on? Is it set up?

78
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:15,250
It's listed in order
from cutest to ugliest.

79
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:16,918
Clyde's number one.

80
00:04:17,179 --> 00:04:19,002
Me? I'm the cutest?

81
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,089
And then Token, and then me.

82
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:23,007
I'm number two? Wow.

83
00:04:23,268 --> 00:04:24,843
Come on, let me see!

84
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,975
Oh boy! I'm number 11!

85
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,592
Whoopee! Number 11!

86
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,939
Ah! Look at that!

87
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,948
I'm hotter than you, fatso!

88
00:04:40,148 --> 00:04:41,798
What?! That's bullcrap!

89
00:04:45,616 --> 00:04:47,656
Oh, so big deal, guys!
You feel better now?

90
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:50,702
Clyde's the best looking kid
in the class. And then Token and Stan,

91
00:04:50,963 --> 00:04:53,263
and last is Francis, Cartman, and...

92
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:00,824
Me?

93
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:03,415
You're last, dude!

94
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:07,700
- No way.
- Yes way! Check it out!

95
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,059
- Cartman, lay off! You're next to last.
- So? I'm hotter than Kyle.

96
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:14,767
I'm better looking than Kyle!

97
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:17,978
Yes! I'm hotter than Kyle!
I'm hotter than Kyle!

98
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:20,613
I'm last? Last?

99
00:05:20,813 --> 00:05:23,313
Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember?

100
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:27,133
I got voted the ugliest boy
in the whole class?

101
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,991
Who cares what dumb girls think, right?

102
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,495
Mom, Dad! I'm not the
ugliest kid in the class!

103
00:05:51,695 --> 00:05:53,145
Kyle Broflovski is!

104
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:56,438
- Well good for you, Butters.
- Way to go, champ.

105
00:05:56,638 --> 00:05:57,676
Whoopee!

106
00:05:58,906 --> 00:06:01,456
Well, guess we don't have
to ground him.

107
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:07,654
Kyle, what's the matter?
You barely touched your knishes.

108
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:10,399
The... girls at school.

109
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:13,449
They made a list and
voted me the ugliest boy.

110
00:06:13,754 --> 00:06:17,746
What? That's ridiculous.
My little bubbeleh is adorable!

111
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:20,035
Look, I know I'm not
the best-looking guy in town,

112
00:06:20,155 --> 00:06:22,085
but I I didn't think
I was the very ugliest.

113
00:06:22,346 --> 00:06:25,145
You're not ugly, Kyle.
You're my perfect little man.

114
00:06:25,345 --> 00:06:27,396
You look just like your father.

115
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:30,509
Oh God! I do?

116
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:32,720
But he has his mother's nose.

117
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:37,433
Kyle, you are very handsome
and perfect in every way.

118
00:06:37,694 --> 00:06:40,944
Ike, Ike, you have to be honest.
Am I ugly, yes or no?

119
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:48,459
You all think I'm ugly!

120
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:50,850
Jesus Christ, the least
you could have done is told me!

121
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,520
Kyle, come back here!

122
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:02,534
I'm better-looking than you!

123
00:07:04,496 --> 00:07:07,546
The girls think I'm
better-looking than you, Kyle!

124
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:09,577
Dude, Kyle.

125
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:11,027
Can you hear me?

126
00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:13,755
They totally think
I'm hotter than you are.

127
00:07:13,955 --> 00:07:14,955
Kyle!

128
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:18,572
Kyle, I'm more attractive. Kyle?

129
00:07:21,078 --> 00:07:23,478
Clyde, it's time to be getting to bed.

130
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,950
Hey, what's goin' on?

131
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:31,488
What's goin on? Hey.

132
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:35,778
Oh yeah, hey, whassup?
What's goin' on?

133
00:07:37,752 --> 00:07:38,752
Nice.

134
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:49,574
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- Hey Clyde.

135
00:07:49,774 --> 00:07:51,035
- Hey.
- Hi Clyde.

136
00:07:51,235 --> 00:07:52,425
What's goin' on?

137
00:07:55,826 --> 00:07:56,826
Hey ugly!

138
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:03,934
Hey, Kyle.

139
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:07,276
Look man, it doesn't matter
what people think, okay?

140
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:10,353
You know,
Abraham Lincoln was pretty ugly too,

141
00:08:10,553 --> 00:08:12,553
but look what he accomplished.

142
00:08:13,256 --> 00:08:14,556
Chin up, cowboy.

143
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,970
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- Oh, not much, just hanging around.

144
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,248
Hey, nice... nice ears!

145
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:21,966
Pizza Face!

146
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:27,077
Butters, that's not cool, man.
He can't help how he looks.

147
00:08:31,364 --> 00:08:34,564
Kyle, I was going to suggest
that maybe you should...

148
00:08:35,184 --> 00:08:37,572
hang out with the other
ugly kids in the school.

149
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:41,822
Because if you hang out with them,
you won't stand out so much. Right?

150
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:43,225
Cool.

151
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:01,869
Hey.

152
00:09:03,578 --> 00:09:04,578
Hello.

153
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:11,406
Are you going to eat your pickle?

154
00:09:39,957 --> 00:09:43,953
Could somebody toss the football back?
It's over there next to the ugly kids.

155
00:09:46,918 --> 00:09:48,725
I hate coming to this school.

156
00:09:48,925 --> 00:09:50,325
It makes me angry.

157
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:51,941
Yeah.

158
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:54,663
Sometimes I just want to burn it down.

159
00:09:54,863 --> 00:09:57,730
Burn the whole school
down to the ground!

160
00:09:58,943 --> 00:10:01,389
No. You know what? Screw this!

161
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:02,821
We aren't ugly!

162
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:04,624
- We're not?
- No!

163
00:10:04,824 --> 00:10:07,506
Maybe we all just need
a little image change, you know?

164
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:09,006
Like a makeover.

165
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:10,242
Hey yeah.

166
00:10:10,463 --> 00:10:11,523
Like you!

167
00:10:11,723 --> 00:10:13,191
Maybe you just need
to let your hair down.

168
00:10:13,452 --> 00:10:16,452
And let's see how you
look without those glasses.

169
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,453
Let's just... put those back on.

170
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:38,717
I know, that song is so awesome.

171
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:41,538
Uh Wendy. Could I talk to you?

172
00:10:42,597 --> 00:10:43,920
Of course, Stan.

173
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,380
Just for a minute. Over here.

174
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:50,770
You think he's gonna
beg her to come back to him?

175
00:10:51,373 --> 00:10:52,722
This is a nice surprise.

176
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:54,499
I thought you were
never speaking to me again.

177
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:57,252
Yeah well, I wanna talk to you
about this list you girls made.

178
00:10:57,372 --> 00:10:58,959
Which one? We make lists all the time.

179
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:00,780
The one where you rated
the boys' looks in the class.

180
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:04,158
Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay?
How could you vote him the ugliest?

181
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:06,486
Look, personally,
I didn't vote him the ugliest.

182
00:11:06,606 --> 00:11:09,271
My vote was for Eric Cartman.
But enough of the other girls must have-

183
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:11,826
So it wasn't unanimous.
Maybe you can just change the list.

184
00:11:11,946 --> 00:11:13,125
Change the list?!

185
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:15,105
Do you have any idea
what that would take?!

186
00:11:15,225 --> 00:11:17,946
Maybe you don't understand
how important list-making is to girls!

187
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:20,800
It's just not something we
do flippantly! There's protocol!

188
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:22,825
Can't we just talk to
all the girls who made the list

189
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:25,304
and find out why they voted Kyle last?

190
00:11:26,806 --> 00:11:29,556
All right, I'll try and get
you into our next list-making meeting.

191
00:11:29,676 --> 00:11:31,226
But it won't be easy.

192
00:11:36,586 --> 00:11:39,086
Today's list meeting is called to order.

193
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,861
Rebecca, you have the floor.

194
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:45,382
If it pleases and sparkles I suggest
we continue deliberations on List 47D:

195
00:11:45,582 --> 00:11:47,326
Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse?

196
00:11:47,587 --> 00:11:51,497
Rebecca moves we work on List 47D.
Does that sparkle with all the girls?

197
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:52,872
Sunshine.

198
00:11:53,134 --> 00:11:56,711
Deliberating "Which Girl Has
The Cutest Purse"? Milly has the floor.

199
00:11:57,205 --> 00:11:59,190
If it pleases and sparkles,
I would like to submit

200
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,225
that Jennifer's purse
is by far the cutest.

201
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,967
Definitely cuter than Teresa's.

202
00:12:03,228 --> 00:12:04,785
I don't think anyone here disagrees

203
00:12:04,905 --> 00:12:06,715
that Jennifer's purse
is cuter than Teresa's,

204
00:12:06,835 --> 00:12:08,014
but it doesn't make it the cutest.

205
00:12:08,275 --> 00:12:10,903
The committee has already decided
that nothing with stripes

206
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:13,223
can be in the Top 5 cutest purses.

207
00:12:13,742 --> 00:12:15,855
Sunshine sparkle Wendy has the floor.

208
00:12:16,757 --> 00:12:20,407
If it pleases and sparkles,
I would like to suggest that we...

209
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:23,446
That we reopen last
week's list for debate.

210
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:26,948
What'd she say?
She's gotta be kidding! Is she crazy?

211
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,952
All right, all right,
come before the Rainbow Railing.

212
00:12:31,414 --> 00:12:32,414
Go ahead.

213
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:36,917
I was just thinking that maybe you voted
a little... hastily on the cutest boy?

214
00:12:37,178 --> 00:12:38,708
You thought you should be number one?

215
00:12:38,828 --> 00:12:40,306
- No!
- Let me assure you

216
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:43,007
that no list is made hastily
by this committee!

217
00:12:43,268 --> 00:12:44,345
He didn't mean that.

218
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:47,595
He was just saying maybe we
should open it up again for discussion.

219
00:12:47,856 --> 00:12:50,907
I cannot by Sparkle Law move
to have an old list investigated.

220
00:12:51,107 --> 00:12:53,870
However, if you can find
recourse for such an inquiry, Wendy,

221
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,687
I would review it.
Does that sparkle with all the girls?

222
00:12:56,948 --> 00:12:58,104
Sunshine.

223
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:09,833
They all laugh at me!
And the girls giggle behind my back!

224
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:12,648
Unable to even glance
at my disfigured face.

225
00:13:12,848 --> 00:13:15,555
<i>Do not burn down the school, Kyle.</i>

226
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,892
- Who said that?
- <i>I did.</i>

227
00:13:22,032 --> 00:13:23,918
Do you know who I am?

228
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:26,244
Abraham Lincoln?

229
00:13:26,444 --> 00:13:28,637
I am Abraham Lincoln.

230
00:13:29,277 --> 00:13:32,555
Burning down the school
will not solve your problems.

231
00:13:32,893 --> 00:13:35,687
You think you've been
cheated because you are ugly,

232
00:13:35,887 --> 00:13:38,269
but I am here to show you otherwise.

233
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:41,202
Come! There is much to see.

234
00:13:42,915 --> 00:13:44,765
I want you to look in here.

235
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:47,323
This woman is Nancy Pinkerton.

236
00:13:47,523 --> 00:13:51,950
As a child she was consistently the most
beautiful girl in her entire school.

237
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:54,833
Her life as a youth
was filled with praises,

238
00:13:54,956 --> 00:13:56,789
and everything being handed to her.

239
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:00,459
Boys told her she was special.
She was funny. She was interesting.

240
00:14:01,126 --> 00:14:03,426
But that's only because she was hot.

241
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:08,054
It wasn't until she reached age 40,
when her looks started to fade,

242
00:14:08,254 --> 00:14:11,556
that she learned she was actually
about as interesting and special,

243
00:14:11,756 --> 00:14:13,056
as a wet carrot.

244
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:18,810
This is the home of
your new ugly friend, Yamal.

245
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:21,847
Because he's ugly,
he gets nothing handed to him.

246
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:24,358
He has to work at making
something of himself.

247
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:29,191
But that work is gonna pay off when
he's an adult. He will have character.

248
00:14:29,391 --> 00:14:31,949
Something that kids
who are hot rarely develop.

249
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:36,075
Like your classmate, Clyde.
Now that he knows he's good-looking,

250
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,928
he doesn't have to make
any effort to be special.

251
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,378
Naw, Rebecca's just a friend.
I wanna be with you now.

252
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,129
Sure, yeah, I'll buy you some shoes too.

253
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,660
Now his life will be about girls.

254
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,721
Chatting with them on the
phone and buying them shoes.

255
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:52,916
He will most likely marry very young,

256
00:14:53,116 --> 00:14:56,890
and not realize until age
40 that he's a total douche.

257
00:14:57,388 --> 00:14:58,893
And so you see, Kyle,

258
00:14:59,154 --> 00:15:02,112
it is actually the beautiful
kids that are cursed.

259
00:15:02,312 --> 00:15:05,773
But I can't wait to be an adult
to be happy. That's forever from now.

260
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:07,221
You must be patient.

261
00:15:07,421 --> 00:15:11,121
Just take me home! I don't
wanna be here anymore! Take me home!

262
00:15:11,831 --> 00:15:13,130
Very well.

263
00:15:19,174 --> 00:15:21,544
Kyle, you need to think
about what I've told you.

264
00:15:21,744 --> 00:15:25,383
I don't want to! I don't want
anybody telling me how to feel anymore!

265
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,083
Well then you're just a fucking asshole!

266
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:37,285
Wait a minute.
Wait, Stan, I think I've got something!

267
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:38,703
Take a look at this:

268
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:41,145
during final deliberation
of the list for cutest boy,

269
00:15:41,265 --> 00:15:44,313
seven girls gave Clyde a
glitter rating of only one sparkle.

270
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:47,130
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

271
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,334
It doesn't add up. It is possible
that Rebecca made a mistake

272
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:53,614
when she tallied the sunshine
votes onto the final list.

273
00:15:56,528 --> 00:15:58,665
- Oh, hey Wendy.
- Hey Rebecca.

274
00:15:58,865 --> 00:16:01,747
Do you still have the voter cards
for the list that rated the boys' looks?

275
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:03,916
Oho Wendy, we're done with that list.

276
00:16:04,177 --> 00:16:06,190
I know, but I think
there's been a mistake.

277
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,114
Six of the girls I've talked
to didn't vote Clyde the cutest.

278
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:10,881
That means that mathematically
he should have been-

279
00:16:11,142 --> 00:16:14,893
All right, you need to stop...
digging around, Wendy!

280
00:16:15,788 --> 00:16:18,762
You might not like... what you find!

281
00:16:19,116 --> 00:16:22,532
Just back off and stop asking questions!

282
00:16:22,768 --> 00:16:26,408
You're getting close to a secret
that I don't think you can handle!

283
00:16:26,608 --> 00:16:28,429
Let it... go!

284
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,308
That didn't sparkle with her, did it?

285
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:40,903
One canister of propane,

286
00:16:41,404 --> 00:16:43,163
six cans of lighter fluid,

287
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,124
seven gallons of high-octane kerosene,

288
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:50,921
and a box of matches.
Okay, is that everything, little boy?

289
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:53,841
That should just about do it.

290
00:16:54,102 --> 00:16:56,927
Do you like to put this
on your True-Value card today?

291
00:16:57,598 --> 00:16:59,263
Honorary Chair, Mrs. Secretary,

292
00:16:59,524 --> 00:17:02,308
I believe a member of our committee
has tampered with one of our lists.

293
00:17:02,974 --> 00:17:04,143
I've compiled a full report,

294
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:07,225
and it turns out that nobody voted
Clyde the cutest in the class.

295
00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:10,845
I believe Rebecca changed the list
to make him number one.

296
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:12,693
Why would she do that?

297
00:17:12,954 --> 00:17:16,044
Right after the list was made,
Rebecca started going out with Clyde.

298
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:20,242
You can read all the discrepancies here.
We need to remake that list.

299
00:17:24,415 --> 00:17:26,938
You just couldn't let it go!

300
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,460
What do you mean? Call the girls in.

301
00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:32,075
I'm afraid we can't do that, Wendy!

302
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:36,536
Did you know, Wendy, that Clyde's
father own the shoe store at the mall?

303
00:17:36,736 --> 00:17:39,494
A lot of us have always wanted
to date Clyde to get free shoes,

304
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:42,664
but we couldn't,
because he wasn't popular enough.

305
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,475
You knew!

306
00:17:45,737 --> 00:17:49,011
Unfortunately, the members voted
Clyde in the bottom five of the list!

307
00:17:49,211 --> 00:17:51,198
That's why we had
to manipulate the votes,

308
00:17:51,318 --> 00:17:54,502
forge a new list, and...
hide the real one!

309
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:58,686
So that you all could justify
dating Clyde and get shoes?!

310
00:17:58,963 --> 00:18:01,316
How dare you take
advantage of your position!

311
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:04,828
I'm gonna tell Bebe and have you
both disbarred from the list committee!

312
00:18:05,362 --> 00:18:08,262
Bebe?! Who do you think
authorized the buyout?!

313
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,669
No. Not Bebe.

314
00:18:12,931 --> 00:18:16,331
She's dating Clyde now.
Nobody loves shoes more than her.

315
00:18:17,237 --> 00:18:18,271
What's going on?

316
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:20,469
When the other girls find out
you ignored their votes, they're gonna-

317
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,484
Do you really think they'll believe
you over the heads of the committee?!

318
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,512
We'll simple generate a new list!

319
00:18:25,712 --> 00:18:28,351
"Biggest Liars"! And put you at the top!

320
00:18:28,613 --> 00:18:32,963
Do yourself a favor, Wendy! Just let
it go! And keep your little mouth shut!

321
00:18:33,587 --> 00:18:34,937
I don't think so!

322
00:18:36,218 --> 00:18:37,360
Stan, run!

323
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:38,948
Jesus, dude!

324
00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:48,799
Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle?

325
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:50,916
We've looked everywhere
and we have to show him something.

326
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:54,286
He's burning down the school.

327
00:18:54,754 --> 00:18:55,754
What?

328
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:58,549
He said he gonna burn
the school down to the ground.

329
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:08,545
All the cruel jokes and
ridicule will finally be over!

330
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:11,981
Are you happy now, God?!
You made me look like this!

331
00:19:12,474 --> 00:19:15,547
- Kyle! Kyle, don't!
- Don't try and stop me, Stan!

332
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:18,402
You don't know how it feels
to be a deformed monstrosity!

333
00:19:18,663 --> 00:19:21,779
- The list was a forgery, Kyle!
- Huh??

334
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,700
It didn't sparkle with all the girls.
We have the real list.

335
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,161
That's about far enough!

336
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:29,580
Give me that list, Wendy!

337
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:31,665
Stan, what is going on?!

338
00:19:31,926 --> 00:19:35,002
It was about shoes, Kyle. The
girls wanted shoes, so they set you up.

339
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:37,204
Kyle was simple a casualty!

340
00:19:37,404 --> 00:19:40,237
To move Clyde meant that Craig
has to be moved to number twelve,

341
00:19:40,357 --> 00:19:43,009
which moved Jimmy
down and moved Jason up!

342
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:44,845
So what number was I??

343
00:19:45,106 --> 00:19:48,098
You've compromised everything!
Our lists' integrity!

344
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:51,310
Did you see these shoes, Wendy?!
They're incredible!

345
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:53,872
It doesn't matter how
incredible they are; you can't-

346
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,648
- Oh my God, those are amazing.
- Right?

347
00:19:56,909 --> 00:19:59,610
- Is that a lace across the top?
- No, it's a little strap.

348
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,871
Wendy??

349
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:03,489
Oh, but it doesn't matter.
You took it too far!

350
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,992
If you hadn't gone all Nancy Drew on us,
this would have just gone away!

351
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:08,494
She's gonna kill us?

352
00:20:08,755 --> 00:20:09,986
It's too late, Bebe.

353
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:12,602
I've already made a full report
and sent a copy to the police.

354
00:20:12,722 --> 00:20:13,791
People will know.

355
00:20:14,052 --> 00:20:15,752
Oh please, you're lying.

356
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:23,070
<i>Give it up, Bebe. We know all about it.</i>

357
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:25,350
<i>The list was compromised.</i>

358
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,700
<i>Kyle Broflovski is not
the ugliest boy in the class.</i>

359
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:37,699
Wendy!

360
00:20:53,694 --> 00:20:55,758
Wait, I didn't do anything wrong.

361
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,793
You can explain all that downtown.

362
00:20:59,055 --> 00:21:01,297
Here, Kyle.
We've been through a lot, but,

363
00:21:01,497 --> 00:21:04,697
you can finally see where
you really are on the list.

364
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,416
- Sure you're okay with this, Kyle?
- I'm sure.

365
00:21:13,616 --> 00:21:14,933
Abe Lincoln was right:

366
00:21:15,081 --> 00:21:16,367
I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking

367
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:18,188
and become a total
shithead when I grow up.

368
00:21:19,351 --> 00:21:20,565
Abe Lincoln?

369
00:21:20,827 --> 00:21:23,440
Stan, it's been really
great hanging out with you again.

370
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,051
I feel like you've changed somehow.
In a really awesome way.

371
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:28,310
Yeah well,

372
00:21:28,728 --> 00:21:31,578
I guess a lot of things...
change, don't they?

373
00:21:41,472 --> 00:21:45,264
