South Park - Season 12 Episode 4
"Canada on Strike"

2
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:37,525
Students, quiet please, m'kay?

3
00:00:37,645 --> 00:00:42,495
As you may or may not know,
today is Canada Appreciation Day.

4
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:45,081
Oh God, I'm bored already.

5
00:00:45,636 --> 00:00:48,315
M'kay, so we've been
asked to show you a video

6
00:00:48,435 --> 00:00:50,433
from the World Canadian Bureau.

7
00:00:50,553 --> 00:00:52,653
Start the tape please?

8
00:00:53,027 --> 00:00:57,399
<i>Hello, I am Stephen Abootman,
President of the World Canadian Bureau.</i>

9
00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:00,555
<i>Do you ever stop to think
how important Canada is to the world?</i>

10
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:03,441
<i>Right now, I would like
all students of Canadian descent</i>

11
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:05,411
<i>in this school to stand up.</i>

12
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:11,551
<i>Just look at all these
fine Canadians in your school.</i>

13
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,568
<i>See how diverse they are.</i>

14
00:01:14,177 --> 00:01:17,238
<i>When you think of Canada, what's
the one thing that comes to mind?</i>

15
00:01:17,692 --> 00:01:19,092
Gayness!

16
00:01:22,128 --> 00:01:25,845
<i>That's right: spirit! What is it
that makes Canada so important?</i>

17
00:01:25,965 --> 00:01:27,365
Nothing!

18
00:01:34,807 --> 00:01:39,425
My fellow Canadians, for too long we
have been pushed around, and ridicules!

19
00:01:39,545 --> 00:01:43,335
Yesterday was supposed to be
a day of appreciation and understanding!

20
00:01:43,455 --> 00:01:47,143
Instead, Canada Appreciation
Day was mocked worldwide!

21
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,315
Nobody takes us Canadians seriously!

22
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:54,734
It's like the world doesn't
respect Canada at all, eh?

23
00:01:54,994 --> 00:01:57,227
That's right!
And I think it's time for Canada

24
00:01:57,347 --> 00:01:59,898
to show the world just how
bad things would be without it!

25
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:01,873
Together we can send a message!

26
00:02:01,993 --> 00:02:04,703
It's time for Canada... to strike!

27
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:08,964
- Did you say strike?
- Yes!

28
00:02:09,084 --> 00:02:11,984
Every Canadian join me! Join together!

29
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:13,904
Canada, on strike.

30
00:02:14,024 --> 00:02:15,480
Canada, on strike.

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,164
Canada!

32
00:02:17,284 --> 00:02:18,728
Canada!

33
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:20,093
Canada!

34
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:21,955
Canada!

35
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,944
Canada on strike!
Canada says "No more!"

36
00:02:25,064 --> 00:02:28,184
No more neglect! We want respect!
That's what we're striking for!

37
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:31,271
All you bureaucrats and corporate cats
Can all just take a hike!

38
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:34,315
It's Canada! On Strike!

39
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:37,843
Canada on strike!
From Vancouver to St. John's,

40
00:02:37,963 --> 00:02:40,739
We raise our little fingers
for you all to sit upon!

41
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:44,033
And with our fingers up your ass,
you won't be very psyched.

42
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:47,148
It's Canada! On Strike!

43
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:50,616
And we will not bow a bunch!
Our resolve is strong!

44
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:53,960
We even took three hours
to rehearse this striking song!

45
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,755
Canada on strike!
No matter where you are,

46
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,344
If you are Canadian then
you've got to do your part!

47
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:01,915
March out of the halls!

48
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:04,405
That's right, suck my Canadian balls!

49
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:07,254
It's Canada! On Strike!

50
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:10,804
It's Canada! Canada! Canada!

51
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:14,364
On Strike!

52
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:18,930
Ah, when you say

53
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,989
"Canada is on strike,"
what exactly do you mean?

54
00:03:23,526 --> 00:03:25,720
What do you think it means?
We're striking, buddy!

55
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,286
No more! That's it!
Until we get what we want.

56
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,373
Who are you exactly
to authorize this strike?

57
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:36,110
I'm Stephen Abootman!
Leader of the WGA!

58
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:38,481
The WGA?

59
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:41,382
Yes! The World Canadian Bureau!

60
00:03:43,352 --> 00:03:45,852
What exactly does Canada want?

61
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,475
We want: more... money!

62
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:54,062
- Yeah! More money!
- More money from where?

63
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:57,674
Just more money! You know!
Canada doesn't get enough money!

64
00:03:57,794 --> 00:04:00,927
Other countries have lots of money;
we want, we want some of that money!

65
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:02,925
How about- the Internet?

66
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:05,773
The Internet makes lots of money!
So give us some of that money!

67
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:09,910
- Yeah! Give us Internet money!
- A Mister A- Abootman, you seem to-

68
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,984
not understand how...
global economics works. I think that-

69
00:04:13,104 --> 00:04:15,742
Don't give me that
fat-cat fancy lip-wiggling!

70
00:04:15,862 --> 00:04:18,169
Are you gonna give
Canada more money or not?

71
00:04:19,396 --> 00:04:21,141
I'm afraid we can't.

72
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,861
Then you leave Canada no choice.

73
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:26,609
This strike shall continue!

74
00:04:32,235 --> 00:04:34,352


75
00:04:44,837 --> 00:04:48,366
"Honk if you support Canada"
He- hey honey, watch this.

76
00:04:49,435 --> 00:04:51,369
Oh, we're supporting unions.

77
00:04:51,886 --> 00:04:54,035
That's right;
we're a very progressive couple.

78
00:04:54,155 --> 00:04:55,355
Yes.

79
00:04:56,173 --> 00:04:57,768
Oh, that's fun!

80
00:04:57,888 --> 00:05:00,239
Well we've done our
good deed for the week.

81
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:04,022
I think now I can make love
to your anus without making God angry.

82
00:05:04,142 --> 00:05:05,300
Oh really? Goodie!

83
00:05:14,154 --> 00:05:16,921
Guys, I'm really worried
about my brother.

84
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,741
We don't care.

85
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,831
You should care!
This strike affects everybody, fatass!

86
00:05:21,951 --> 00:05:23,735
- Sh ush ush, it's on!
- Yippee!

87
00:05:23,995 --> 00:05:26,007
<i>It's the Terrance and Phillip Show.</i>

88
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:29,073
<i>Today's episode: I Fart Huckabees.</i>

89
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,969
Aw, this one again?

90
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:33,523
God, they've replayed
this one like eighty times now!

91
00:05:33,643 --> 00:05:36,325
Say Phillip,
I just bought this new hybrid car.

92
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:38,372
Oh? Does it run on electricity?

93
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:40,543
No, it uses natural gas.

94
00:05:43,538 --> 00:05:45,261
<i>Not as fat as your face!</i>

95
00:05:45,381 --> 00:05:48,275
Huh, it somehow loses its
punch after multiple viewings.

96
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:50,989
God-damnit, when are they going
to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?

97
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:52,975
There aren't gonna be new shows!
Don't you get it?

98
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:54,609
Terrance and Phillip are Canadian!

99
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,851
We have to get Canada
to end this strike!

100
00:05:57,111 --> 00:05:59,395
It's not a big deal.
We can just watch American comedy.

101
00:06:00,691 --> 00:06:02,482
<i>You think that's bad?</i>

102
00:06:02,742 --> 00:06:06,805
Remember the time I sang
"La Cucaracha" for Paul McCartney?

103
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:09,560
- No! No!
<i>- Cucaracha!</i>

104
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,280
We are not... resorting to that!

105
00:06:17,315 --> 00:06:20,898
One, two, three, four,
Canada deserves more (money)!

106
00:06:21,018 --> 00:06:24,690
One, two, three, four,
Canada deserves more (money)!

107
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:27,415
Look, buddy, me and Phillip
need to go home for a bit.

108
00:06:27,535 --> 00:06:30,229
Go home?
You can't leave the picket line!

109
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,762
But this is taking too long,
and Phillip is diabetic.

110
00:06:33,022 --> 00:06:34,949
Look, guy, we are to stay strong!

111
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:37,735
If you don't stand with your
fellow Canadians, then you are a rat!

112
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:41,184
- Don't call me a rat, buddy!
- I'm not your buddy, friend!

113
00:06:41,304 --> 00:06:44,246
- He's not your friend, guy!
- I'm not your guy, buddy!

114
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:48,316
- He's not your buddy, friend!
- I'm not your friend, guy!

115
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:51,008
Don't you two understand anything?

116
00:06:51,128 --> 00:06:55,072
You think striking is a joke?
You think it's something to ridicule?

117
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:57,120
Yah, you think this is funny?

118
00:06:57,814 --> 00:07:00,581
Don't you see that we have to
stand together or else we have nothing?

119
00:07:00,841 --> 00:07:03,403
Stephen! Stephen!
A call came in from the United States!

120
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,362
They want to talk to
you aboot ending the strike!

121
00:07:05,482 --> 00:07:09,839
What did I tell you? I told you
we'd get to them sooner or later!

122
00:07:12,157 --> 00:07:15,457
Shh, shh, quiet everyone!
Let me handle this.

123
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:20,059
Yes. This is Stephen Abootman,
head of the WGA.

124
00:07:21,044 --> 00:07:23,813
Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike.

125
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:25,891
Oh you do, huh?

126
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:29,878
They've had enough.
They want us to end the strike.

127
00:07:32,623 --> 00:07:35,650
Quiet, quiet, shh, shh,
sh- quiet, quiet! Let me deal with this.

128
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,141
All right,
we're prepared to end this strike!

129
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:41,748
If you are agreeing that
we should have more money!

130
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,625
We totally think you
should have more money.

131
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,523
We got 'em! We did it!

132
00:07:51,616 --> 00:07:54,052
All right,
how much are you gonna give us?

133
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:57,305
Huh? Well we don't really
have that much money.

134
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,809
Oh, negotiating hardball, are we?
What about all that Internet money?

135
00:08:02,638 --> 00:08:05,284
- The Internet?
- You listen to me, friend!

136
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:07,624
You'd better figure out a way
to get us our fair amount of money,

137
00:08:07,744 --> 00:08:11,155
and until you come back with a solid
fair number, I'm finished talking to you,

138
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:13,725
you slimy corporate dickhead!

139
00:08:15,885 --> 00:08:18,245
Don't worry, don't worry.
This is how negotiating works.

140
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:21,465
This is good.
We've got 'em by the balls.

141
00:08:25,364 --> 00:08:26,820
What'd they say?

142
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,972
They said we have to give them
money that we make on the Internet.

143
00:08:31,092 --> 00:08:34,613
How are we supposed to
make money on the Internet?

144
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:38,889
Well, how do other people
make money on the Internet?

145
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:40,424
We'd have to put something up

146
00:08:40,544 --> 00:08:43,903
on the Internet that everyone
would find fascinating.

147
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,923
Wait. I've got it.

148
00:08:53,747 --> 00:08:55,742
I said what what? In the butt

149
00:08:55,862 --> 00:08:57,751
I said what what? In the butt

150
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,789
I said what what? In the butt

151
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:01,704
I said what what? In the butt

152
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:03,755
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?

153
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,790
<i>You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?</i>

154
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,784
<i>You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?</i>

155
00:09:07,904 --> 00:09:10,538
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!

156
00:09:10,658 --> 00:09:13,662
It's okay
If you have a little fight

157
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:17,335
<i>Don't you worry
I won't bite</i>

158
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:19,595
(Not that hard)
If you want it

159
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:22,056
<i>I'll give you power</i>

160
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:25,837
Just be gentle
I'm delicate like a flower

161
00:09:26,644 --> 00:09:28,435
<i>Give it to me, if you please</i>

162
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:30,398
<i>- Give it to me, if you please</i>
- Oh my.

163
00:09:30,658 --> 00:09:31,658
In the butt

164
00:09:31,778 --> 00:09:33,677
I said what what? In the butt

165
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:35,712
I said what what? In the butt

166
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:37,692
I said what what? In the butt

167
00:09:37,812 --> 00:09:39,711
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?

168
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:41,492
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?

169
00:09:41,752 --> 00:09:43,744
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?

170
00:09:44,004 --> 00:09:46,455
<i>Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!</i>

171
00:09:46,715 --> 00:09:49,959
- There's more people viewing it!
- This is going great!

172
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,247
Don't worry, Ike!
The strike will be over soon!

173
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:06,280
And in other world news,

174
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,897
the leader of Japan today is calling
for an increase in military spending.

175
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:13,099
How come they never
mention anything about us?

176
00:10:13,219 --> 00:10:16,548
- When are they gonna get to the strike?
- Don't worry, the strike is big news.

177
00:10:16,668 --> 00:10:18,279
I'm sure it will be
one of the top stories.

178
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:20,899
In other news tonight,
it the Internet video

179
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:24,011
that has already seen
over ten million views.

180
00:10:24,131 --> 00:10:27,853
A young confused-looking boy
dancing and singing a song called

181
00:10:27,973 --> 00:10:29,874
"What What (In My Asshole)"

182
00:10:30,374 --> 00:10:32,364
Tom, in just one week
the video has become

183
00:10:32,484 --> 00:10:34,742
the most watched
thing in all of America.

184
00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:38,825
The boy in the video, referred to
by most as "that little gay kid,"

185
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:42,929
has already been asked to appear
on Jimmy Kimmel and The Today Show.

186
00:10:43,907 --> 00:10:45,803
Aw damnit that's not news!

187
00:10:45,923 --> 00:10:47,438
What about us?

188
00:10:47,558 --> 00:10:50,980
Look, ah, Stephen,
Terrance and I were talking and,

189
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,872
it's starting to look like maybe we're
not gonna win this thing, you know?

190
00:10:54,992 --> 00:10:57,151
We'll win!
We'll just have to stay resilient!

191
00:10:57,564 --> 00:11:00,389
Wull, yeah, but
everyone is dying of starvation.

192
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:01,948
Yeah, let's give it up, guy.

193
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,992
Don't call me your guy!
I'm not your guy, friend!

194
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:09,036
- Well I'm not your friend, buddy!
- Well I'm not your buddy, guy!

195
00:11:09,156 --> 00:11:11,374
Wait! Here it is! Turn it up! We're on!

196
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:15,652
And finally tonight,
a new development in the Canada strike.

197
00:11:15,772 --> 00:11:18,052
For those of you who
don't remember or don't care,

198
00:11:18,172 --> 00:11:20,007
Canada has been striking
for more money.

199
00:11:20,267 --> 00:11:22,302
Yeah! All right!

200
00:11:22,422 --> 00:11:25,471
Shh! I told you, listen, listen...

201
00:11:25,908 --> 00:11:28,347
In a shocking turn of events,
it now appears that

202
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:30,324
thousands of people from Denmark

203
00:11:30,444 --> 00:11:33,530
are flooding into the United States
with hopes of taking the place

204
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,022
of the striking Canadians.

205
00:11:36,024 --> 00:11:37,024
What?

206
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:40,092
Do you really think you
Danish can replace the Canadians?

207
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:43,079
Well, where we come from
it's pretty cold too, ja.

208
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:46,373
We like hockey and nobody
really pays any attention to us.

209
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:48,664
- Nobody knows where Denmark is.
- Right.

210
00:11:48,784 --> 00:11:52,081
So when you think about it,
we're the Canadians of Europe.

211
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,084
Scabs! How could you?

212
00:12:01,064 --> 00:12:03,429
Ah, hi. We made a really
successful thing on the Internet,

213
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:04,969
and we'd like to collect our money.

214
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:07,513
Take a number and
wait with everyone else.

215
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:09,422
Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize

216
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,726
the Internet sensation
Little Gay Kid from YouToob?

217
00:12:11,986 --> 00:12:14,729
Take a number and
wait with everyone else!

218
00:12:23,364 --> 00:12:25,568
Chocolate Rain.

219
00:12:26,755 --> 00:12:29,493
Hey, I know you. You're the
"What What (In My Asshole)" kid.

220
00:12:29,753 --> 00:12:33,715
- "What What (In The Butt)," sir.
- It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.

221
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:36,535
Yeah, sure.
All the biggest Internet stars are here.

222
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,905
You remember, of course, Numa Numa.

223
00:12:46,174 --> 00:12:47,774
And the Star Wars kid.

224
00:12:51,148 --> 00:12:53,851
And the Internet sensation
Cute Sneezing Panda.

225
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,606
And there's Dramatic Look Gopher.

226
00:13:03,203 --> 00:13:04,904
Wow, I've seen all
you guys on the Internet!

227
00:13:05,164 --> 00:13:09,085
So, how many people have
seen your Internet video?

228
00:13:09,408 --> 00:13:13,811
- Uh a few hundred thousand?
- Huh, mere peanuts.

229
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:16,858
Chocolate Rain has done gangbusters.

230
00:13:16,978 --> 00:13:19,627
Theoretically, I'm a millionaire.

231
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:22,296
Dude, screw you.
Your Internet thing is so last year.

232
00:13:22,783 --> 00:13:24,924
Leave Chocolate Rain Guy alone!

233
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:28,636
Leave him alone! I'm serious!

234
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:33,224
Excuse me.

235
00:13:34,803 --> 00:13:36,103
Hello?

236
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:40,731
You greedy corporate fat cat.
You said you would get us money.

237
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,108
Wait we're working on it.

238
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:45,083
You're stalling!
Because you think I'll give up.

239
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:49,255
You know that most Canadians are
talking about giving up the strike already.

240
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,117
You've got me over
a barrel and you know it!

241
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:53,119
Sir, we're doing everything we can.

242
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:56,142
You want me to say it again?
You've got me over a barrel!

243
00:13:56,262 --> 00:13:57,495
There, you happy?

244
00:13:57,615 --> 00:13:59,887
You've got me bent over a barrel
with my tender ass just waiting

245
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,294
to be pulverized by
your thrusting manhood!

246
00:14:04,098 --> 00:14:06,074
Do you realize how
stupid I'm going to look

247
00:14:06,194 --> 00:14:08,544
if I call off the strike
after starting all this?

248
00:14:08,664 --> 00:14:11,458
I won't do it!
You hear me, guy? You're wrong!

249
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:14,579
No matter what happens
I will never call of this strike!

250
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:17,601
Even if it means we all. Die.

251
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:19,567
We don't want you to die.

252
00:14:19,687 --> 00:14:23,000
Then you'd better hurry.
We don't have much longer.

253
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,720
The blood will be on your hands.

254
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,972
We have to speed this up!

255
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:34,575
Uh, can we collect our Internet
money in front of you, please?

256
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:36,203
I don't think so.

257
00:14:36,323 --> 00:14:39,748
Nothing takes priority
over Chocolate Rain.

258
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:44,253
Oh, here he goes with the ego again.
Who crowned you the top Internet star?

259
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:45,755
I did.

260
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,341
When I became bigger
than all you bitches.

261
00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:53,220
Oh please, Laughing Baby
had more times as many views as you!

262
00:14:57,481 --> 00:15:00,227
You'd better shut your fucking mouth,
Laughing Baby!

263
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,555
Did you all forget about Afro Ninja?

264
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:04,494
My Internet thing
was bigger than anybody's.

265
00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:07,401
I made over a hundred
million theoretical dollars.

266
00:15:07,661 --> 00:15:10,571
Well Sneezing Panda is
theoretically worth billions!

267
00:15:10,831 --> 00:15:13,115
You all wanna motherfucking die?

268
00:15:13,864 --> 00:15:15,014
No!

269
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,050
Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn.

270
00:15:39,714 --> 00:15:41,852
Leave Tron Guy alone!

271
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:43,729
Leave him alone!

272
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:49,109
Get ready for some
chocolate pain, bitch!

273
00:15:53,457 --> 00:15:55,656
Leave the panda alone!

274
00:15:55,776 --> 00:15:58,249
Leave her alone, I'm serious!

275
00:16:09,264 --> 00:16:11,632
Thought I forgot about you, Gopher?

276
00:16:19,515 --> 00:16:21,451
Uh, my brains.

277
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:31,944
Sweet. I think we're next in line now.

278
00:16:50,517 --> 00:16:53,737
Stephen!, Stephen!
They're here! They've come to negotiate!

279
00:16:53,857 --> 00:16:55,175
What? You mean it?

280
00:16:56,446 --> 00:16:59,388
- Okay, we did it.
- Who the hell are you?

281
00:16:59,648 --> 00:17:01,555
We're the ones you
told to get Internet money.

282
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:04,810
Here. We made ten million theoretical
dollars. It's all for you.

283
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,400
Theoretical dollars? What am I supposed
to do with that? You little timewasters!

284
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,025
Hey, we worked really hard
to get this theoretical money!

285
00:17:14,145 --> 00:17:17,990
- Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.
- You are a homo, Butters.

286
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,076
Yeah, will you just end this thing now?
My little brother is gonna die!

287
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:24,096
No! I'm not gonna
look like an idiot!

288
00:17:24,216 --> 00:17:28,917
If I fucked up and led everyone astray,
the last thing I'm gonna do is admit it!

289
00:17:30,073 --> 00:17:32,211
Yes, this is the head of the WGA.

290
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:34,048
The World Canadian Bureau.

291
00:17:35,342 --> 00:17:38,545
Ah, Mr. Abootman.
It's the global world summit leaders.

292
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:40,387
We want to talk to you about the strike.

293
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:42,348
You... You do?

294
00:17:42,969 --> 00:17:44,350
You wanna negotiate?

295
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,056
No, actually we were just
wondering if, when you're all dead

296
00:17:48,176 --> 00:17:51,106
we can use Newfoundland
for a new global theme park.

297
00:17:58,696 --> 00:18:01,033
Hello? Will you just give
this guy something, please?

298
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:03,004
Excuse me?

299
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,437
He just doesn't
wanna look like an idiot,

300
00:18:04,557 --> 00:18:06,796
so he wants everyone to think
the strike was for something.

301
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,066
<i>Just give him anything!</i>

302
00:18:09,186 --> 00:18:13,754
Well, we could give Canada
some small consolation prize.

303
00:18:14,686 --> 00:18:18,608
If they give you something small,
will you end the strike?

304
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:19,728
Will they...

305
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:23,445
act like they're giving Canada a lot
so everyone thinks I did a good job?

306
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:26,071
Can you act like
you're giving him a lot?

307
00:18:26,191 --> 00:18:27,559
Sure, why not?

308
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:32,819
We have won!

309
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:38,112
So how much did we get?

310
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:41,971
Well, we uh, we didn't get
everything that we wanted, but...

311
00:18:42,091 --> 00:18:43,907
we negotiated hard and...

312
00:18:44,027 --> 00:18:46,927
we got these... coupons to Bennigan's!

313
00:18:47,311 --> 00:18:50,624
And... free bubblegum...
for every Canadian!

314
00:18:56,943 --> 00:19:01,334
These coupons entitle every
Canadian to a free meal at Bennigan's.

315
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:05,343
With the purchase of a meal
at equal or greater value, of course.

316
00:19:05,463 --> 00:19:06,963
We did it!

317
00:19:12,036 --> 00:19:13,143
My friends.

318
00:19:13,263 --> 00:19:16,400
This is the greatest
victory in Canadian history.

319
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,310
Ike. Ike!

320
00:19:35,505 --> 00:19:36,585
It's over.

321
00:19:36,705 --> 00:19:38,905
- It's over?
- Yeah. Here you go.

322
00:19:46,074 --> 00:19:49,016
- Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.
- Me too!

323
00:19:49,361 --> 00:19:51,777
Yeah, but you know,
I learned something today.

324
00:19:51,897 --> 00:19:53,925
We thought we could
make money on the Internet.

325
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:57,195
But, while the Internet is new
and exciting for creative people,

326
00:19:57,315 --> 00:19:59,185
it hasn't matured as
a distribution mechanism

327
00:19:59,305 --> 00:20:02,016
to the extent that one should trade real
and immediate opportunities for income

328
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:03,839
for the promise of
future online revenue.

329
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:06,635
It will be a few years before digital
distribution of media on the Internet

330
00:20:06,755 --> 00:20:09,195
can be monetized to the extent
that necessitates content producers

331
00:20:09,315 --> 00:20:12,965
to forgo their fair value
in more traditional media.

332
00:20:13,468 --> 00:20:14,833
Yeah.

333
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:28,279
Yeah, we did it! Celebrate, everyone!

334
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:32,893


335
00:20:34,186 --> 00:20:37,022
Hold on a minute! Wait just a second!

336
00:20:37,282 --> 00:20:39,045
We just did some calculating!

337
00:20:39,165 --> 00:20:43,385
By not working during the strike,
Canadians lost 10.4 million dollars!

338
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:46,540
And our Bennigan's coupons
and bubble gum is worth roughly...

339
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,450
three thousand and eight dollars!

340
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:51,912
Don't look at that.
Come on, friends, let's dance.

341
00:20:52,172 --> 00:20:53,455
You had no idea what you were doing

342
00:20:53,575 --> 00:20:54,965
and now you're trying
to make it look like you won

343
00:20:55,085 --> 00:20:56,675
so that we won't set you adrift!

344
00:20:56,795 --> 00:21:00,692
Damnit friends, don't you see?
We won for future Canadians, guy.

345
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:03,131
So the little guy doesn't
get pushed around anymore.

346
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:06,468
This was a victory for Canada's respect.

347
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:16,144
- Eh? What do you think you're doing?
- We're sending you adrift, idiot!

348
00:21:17,216 --> 00:21:19,626
Maybe you can go live with the Danish!

349
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:22,067
You'll regret this day, friend!

350
00:21:22,925 --> 00:21:24,820
I'm not your friend, buddy!

351
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:27,906
I'm not your buddy, guy!

352
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,950
He's not your guy, friend!

353
00:21:30,432 --> 00:21:33,495
I'm not your friend, buddy!

354
00:21:33,755 --> 00:21:35,831
We're not your buddies, guy!

355
00:21:36,302 --> 00:21:40,794
I'm not your guy, friends!

356
00:21:41,054 --> 00:21:45,000
