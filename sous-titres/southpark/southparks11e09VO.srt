Well, there's no doubt in my mind,
Mr. Marsh. You are constipated.

3
00:00:41,426 --> 00:00:43,029
Thanks for the news flash!

4
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:47,038
I haven't taken a crap in over
three weeks! The question is why?!

5
00:00:47,158 --> 00:00:49,015
Well, what food have you been eating?

6
00:00:49,135 --> 00:00:52,035
P.F. Chang's, mostly. Good stuff.

7
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,745
I'm going to prescribe a laxative.

8
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,802
But I must warn you:
when you do finally pass this stool,

9
00:00:59,228 --> 00:01:01,502
it might be very painful.

10
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:04,171
How painful is "painful"?

11
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:16,683

That... is huge.

17
00:01:53,717 --> 00:01:57,067
That has got to be the
biggest crap I've ever taken.

What is it, Randy?
Do you have any- Oh!! Randy!

22
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:11,127
Will you look at that? Is that the
biggest crap you've ever seen or what?

23
00:02:11,247 --> 00:02:15,253
- Flush the toilet for Christ's sake!
- Come on! That's pretty impressive!

24

- No way!

27

- No, never.
- Gross, Dad, sick!

28
00:02:27,143 --> 00:02:29,220
All right,
will you flush the toilet now?!

29
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,403
I'll try, but I don't think-

30
00:02:31,523 --> 00:02:34,398
wait wait wait wait a minute.
I gotta call Jimbo first.

31
00:02:34,518 --> 00:02:36,662
- Why?!
- Well he's gotta see this.

32
00:02:36,795 --> 00:02:39,266
- {\No. }We are flushing the toilet right now-
- No!!

33

Jimbo has to see it so when
I tell the guys how big it was,

34
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,687
they'll know I'm not lying!

35
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:47,429
- Oh, for the love of God, Randy!
- Sharon, this is important!

I'm telling you this thing
was the size of a freaking football.

46
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,385
I guess it was pretty big.

47
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:19,014
- A football? That's amazing.
- I've never heard of one that big.

48
00:03:19,134 --> 00:03:22,230
Oh, my brother took a crap once,
that was enormous.

49
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,063
It was the biggest in the
history of the world, I think.

50
00:03:28,256 --> 00:03:30,317
It wasn't bigger than mine was.

51

Oh no, seriously,
this crap was a monster!

00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,257
Mine... mine was bigger.

53
00:03:38,377 --> 00:03:39,910

come out of your ass.

it for splits. It's one solid piece.

You know, when you get real close,

149
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:11,144
you start thinking that
maybe your life is gonna matter.

150
00:10:12,844 --> 00:10:16,344
I mean, this was something I made!

151
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,166
Something that came from me!
That was a part of me!

152
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:24,798
The only thing I ever
made that was any good!

I know that this late in my life

155
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:38,078

to finally having... meaning.

163
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:05,850

of dollars and a Nobel prize nomination!

164

Oh, that's real mature, Sharon!

166
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:14,031
Just act like everything's funny!
It's a big joke to you, isn't it?!

167
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:16,981
Just a big joke! Don't touch me!

It isn't fair!

the record for the world's biggest crap:

ever seen it in person.

Fine, but he has to take
the crap in front of you! In Zurich.

223

Is the only way you
can know he's not cheating!

225

Bono's first award for biggest crap.

283
00:17:39,762 --> 00:17:42,001

- So that's the year Bono was born.

00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:19,927
I kept the crap in my office,
nursed it, fed it biddy.

338
00:20:20,047 --> 00:20:23,556
And soon biddy made him strong.
Biddy made him grow up!

339
00:20:23,676 --> 00:20:26,518
Into one of the most
influential figures of our time.

340
00:20:26,638 --> 00:20:28,668
Easy Bono, that hurts the biddy.

341
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:30,245
Biddy.

342
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:34,298
My little crap has
accomplished many things.

343
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:38,801
But he could never shed the
fact that he was really... a number two.

344
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:42,807
So he spent his life trying
to be number one, in everything.

345
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:44,781
That's why he's able to do so much,

346
00:20:44,901 --> 00:20:48,270
try to help so many people, but
still seem like such a piece of shit.

347
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,774
You have blemished this noble
society's good name, Herr Broloff.

348
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,477
Have I?! Look at the crap
I took all those years ago!

349
00:20:55,597 --> 00:20:59,193
Bono is now almost six feet
tall and over 80 Courics in weight!

350
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:03,600
No matter how you look
at it he is still the record!

351
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,518
Oh God, here it comes!

352
00:21:05,685 --> 00:21:08,921
Oh hot hot hot hot!
Hot hot hot hot hot hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

353
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,034
My God...

354
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:20,845
It must be over a hundred Courics!

355
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,093
- Dad, are you all right?
- Yeah,

356
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,355
I'm... I'm good! Feel a lot better.

357
00:21:26,655 --> 00:21:30,313
Mr. Marsh,
we apologize, and if it's okay with you,

358
00:21:30,433 --> 00:21:34,933
we would like to present you...
your long overdue trophy.
