00:00:33,323 --> 00:00:35,305
And now back to the Wheel of

4
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,388
Fortune

5
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,237
All right, Randy !

6
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:41,176
Grats on making it all the way to the

7
00:00:41,177 --> 00:00:42,190
Bonus Round.

8
00:00:42,362 --> 00:00:43,150
Thanks, Pat.

9
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:45,333
You've got some family here,
watching tonight ?

10
00:00:45,537 --> 00:00:46,999
Yeah, they're all rooting for me.

11
00:00:47,072 --> 00:00:49,479
And I'm sure you have lots of
friends watching back home ?

12
00:00:49,851 --> 00:00:50,686
Yeah,

13
00:00:50,687 --> 00:00:52,594
Hi everybody watching in South Park.

14
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:55,322
That's us, hey, hey.

15
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,581
- Hey, Randy.
- Good luck !

16
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:59,052
Well let see if you can't
make everyone proud.

17
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:00,437
The category is,

18
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:02,731
People who annoy you.

19
00:01:02,736 --> 00:01:03,609
OK.

20
00:01:03,887 --> 00:01:05,432
As always we give you the letters,

21
00:01:05,454 --> 00:01:07,281
R, T, S, L

22
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:08,359
and E.

23
00:01:09,573 --> 00:01:11,647
We just need three more
consonants and a vowel.

24
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:13,401
OK I'd like a B,

25
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:15,256
a N,

26
00:01:15,806 --> 00:01:16,526
and a G.

27
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:17,953
and the vowel ?

28
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:19,360
an O, please.

29
00:01:19,596 --> 00:01:21,955
OK, looks like you're going
to get a lot of help here.

30
00:01:22,565 --> 00:01:23,447
The category is

31
00:01:23,448 --> 00:01:25,190
People who annoy you.

32
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,954
Audience keep quiet please.

33
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,983
UH, well, ...

34
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:35,429
Ten seconds M. Marsh.

35
00:01:35,456 --> 00:01:38,533
I know it but I don't
think I should say it.

36
00:01:38,574 --> 00:01:39,740
Five seconds M. Marsh.

37
00:01:39,772 --> 00:01:41,306
I'd like to solve the puzzle.

38
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:44,206
NIGGERS.

39
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,279
OH, naggers, of course,

40
00:02:01,477 --> 00:02:02,540
Naggers.

41
00:02:02,693 --> 00:02:03,662
Right.

42
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,242
UH, can we cut to ...

43
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:07,940
could we cut to...

44
00:02:18,078 --> 00:02:18,865
Well,

45
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:19,861
Gave is my best shot.

46
00:02:20,856 --> 00:02:22,384
At least we had a fup trip, gang ?

47
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,697
I can't believe you said the N-word
on national television.

48
00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:29,564
What ?

49
00:02:30,152 --> 00:02:32,010
Well, what i was
supposed to do, Sharon ?

50
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:34,419
I thought I was going to make $ 30 000 !

51
00:02:35,203 --> 00:02:37,863
Stanley, the only reason daddy
used that word

52
00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:39,440
is that he thought he would win money !

53
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:45,586
Dude, did your dad know
the show was broadcast live ?

54
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,269
Dude, the funniest thing I ever seen,

55
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:49,544
I watched it on YouTube about 60 times.

56
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,235
Can we just drop this, please ?

57
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,780
I don't want to talk about it.

58
00:02:52,902 --> 00:02:54,868
Yeah, well, it's not us
you have to worry about.

59
00:02:55,685 --> 00:02:56,691
It's Token.

60
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:04,144
He's going to want to kick
your crasher teeth in.

61
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,006
No, he's not.

62
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:06,064
Is he ?

63
00:03:06,065 --> 00:03:06,784
I don't know

64
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:08,246
I just need to explain things.

65
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,377
Hey, Token,

66
00:03:11,954 --> 00:03:14,859
Look, I don't know if you saw
Wheel of Fortune last night, but...

67
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,057
Yeah, I was watching it
with my whole family?

68
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:19,298
and then we saw the replays
this morning on the news.

69
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:21,310
Listen, Token, my dad is not a racist.

70
00:03:21,504 --> 00:03:22,653
He's just stupid, all right ?

71
00:03:23,074 --> 00:03:25,453
He just blurted out the N-word,
it's not a big deal, OK ?

72
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:29,132
Well, actually it's kind after big deal,
Stan.

73
00:03:30,872 --> 00:03:33,913
It may be a mistake you don't understand
how it feels when the N-word comes up.

74
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,421
Don't say it isn't a big deal.

75
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:36,602
OH, *
here we go,

76
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:37,956
It's on,

77
00:03:37,957 --> 00:03:39,480
race war,

78
00:03:40,227 --> 00:03:40,870
race war !

79
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:44,379
race war is on, everybody !

80
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:46,641
It's goind down ! *
Going down !

81
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:50,635
Token my dad wasn't trying to be
offensive, just forget about it.

82
00:03:50,636 --> 00:03:51,954
It's easy for you to say, Stan.

83
00:03:51,955 --> 00:03:53,001
Yeah, come on. Here we go !

84
00:03:53,138 --> 00:03:55,419
He didn't say it in anger
or anything like that.

85
00:03:55,575 --> 00:03:57,115
That doesn't mean I can just be fine.

86
00:03:57,186 --> 00:03:59,170
Race war, come on, race war !

87
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:02,180
If you really think it's not a big deal,
then you're really ignorant.

88
00:04:02,603 --> 00:04:03,433
That's all.

89
00:04:03,496 --> 00:04:04,859
I'l not fighting anybody !

90
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:08,164
Token forefits !

91
00:04:08,785 --> 00:04:09,742
Whites win !

92
00:04:10,398 --> 00:04:11,530
Whites win !

93
00:04:11,788 --> 00:04:14,308
Race war is over again, everybody !
Whites won again !

94
00:04:16,142 --> 00:04:19,726
I want to apologize deeply
and sincerely for using

95
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:21,734
the N-word on Wheel of Fortune,

96
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:26,327
and I want to assure you that I'm not
a racist, reverend Jackson.

97
00:04:29,927 --> 00:04:34,071
The puzzle you were solving
was people annoy to you?

98
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:38,197
Well, like anybody else thought
it was naggers, I mean, right ?

99
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,037
M. Marsh, you need to take time to
understand african-american culture.

100
00:04:43,436 --> 00:04:46,299
Visit black museums, see black
performers and artists.

101
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:47,520
Oh, I will,

102
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,881
I'm really down
with african-americans.

103
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:55,634
Do you really want to apologize ?
Are you sure ?

104
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:57,838
Yes, absolutely

105
00:04:57,918 --> 00:04:58,731
Very well.

106
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:00,518
If you want to apologize.

107
00:05:00,823 --> 00:05:01,653
I will accept.

108
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:03,999
Oh, thank you, M. Jackson.
Thank you.

109
00:05:04,217 --> 00:05:06,679
Brian, get a picture of
M. Marsh apologizing.

110
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,608
Ready to go, Sir.

111
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:12,978
Kiss it.

112
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:13,736
Uh?

113
00:05:14,132 --> 00:05:15,970
Apologize, kiss it.

114
00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:21,469
- You want me to kiss your ...
- That's right, apologize.

115
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,286
Oh, OK,

116
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,103
let's see.

117
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:28,631
Apologize.

118
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:40,050
Hey, Token, I just wanted to let you
know, that everything is cool now.

119
00:05:40,235 --> 00:05:42,543
My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.

120
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,133
Oh, I see. So I'm supposed to feel all
better now ?

121
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:46,469
Well, yeah.

122
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:48,164
You just don't get it, Stan.

123
00:05:48,634 --> 00:05:50,651
Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's OK.

124
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:53,504
Jesse Jackson is not the
emporer of black people !

125
00:05:56,179 --> 00:05:57,559
He told my dad he was.

126
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:02,371
Today we are going to have a
guest speaker talk to us about

127
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:05,121
sensitivity and the power of words.

128
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,054
In a moment, you will meet
Dr. David Nelson,

129
00:06:08,055 --> 00:06:11,018
who has firsthand experience
in overcoming slander

130
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:12,691
because David is himself

131
00:06:12,884 --> 00:06:13,994
a little person.

132
00:06:14,463 --> 00:06:16,431
Who knows what a little person is?

133
00:06:18,154 --> 00:06:19,319
Yes, over there?

134
00:06:20,094 --> 00:06:20,737
A midget?

135
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,901
Not exactly.

136
00:06:22,902 --> 00:06:25,435
That term is actually considered
offensive.

137
00:06:25,436 --> 00:06:28,207
And that's why Dr. Nelson
goes from school to school

138
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,788
getting us all to think

139
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:31,184
about what we say.

140
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,082
He has two Ph.D.'s
and has published six books,

141
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,491
Please welcome David Nelson!

142
00:06:40,548 --> 00:06:43,270
Good morning, students.
How are we all feeling today?

143
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:57,169
I would like to share with you all my--

144
00:06:57,987 --> 00:06:59,703
No, dude, no.

145
00:06:59,743 --> 00:07:00,786
[Bleep]
Way!

146
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:03,502
Dude.

147
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:09,000
That, that words are like bullets,
and if you give--

148
00:07:12,763 --> 00:07:15,538
Just stop, stop, stop!

149
00:07:16,128 --> 00:07:17,589
Eric, be quiet.

150
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,332
No, no, it's OK,

151
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,665
he'll run out of steam here pretty soon!

152
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:36,913
Look, look, look!

153
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,642
They put a little suit on him!

154
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,381
So I said to my wife,

155
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:48,699
You told me to kill the damn cockroach,
don't yell at me for making a mess!

156
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:53,351
We got a great crowd here tonight.

157
00:07:53,352 --> 00:07:55,757
Now, how many people are actually
from Colorado?

158
00:07:58,908 --> 00:08:01,898
Nothing better to do on a friday night
than go to a comedy club, uh?

159
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:07,167
Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?

160
00:08:10,128 --> 00:08:11,737
Yeah, I know you,

161
00:08:11,898 --> 00:08:14,379
<i>You're the guy that said the nigger
on Wheel of Fortune!</i>

162
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:19,708
Look, everybody, it's the N-guy.

163
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:22,403
Hey, it is him.

164
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:24,923
We got a star in the club.

165
00:08:24,924 --> 00:08:28,763
Everyone wave to the N-guy,
say "Hi, N-guy."

166
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:30,225
Hi, N-guy!

167
00:08:33,094 --> 00:08:36,057
That's all right, N-guy,
you know we're just playing.

168
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,524
Yeah.
No problem.

169
00:08:39,516 --> 00:08:43,337
You've seen these navigation systems
in these cars, these days?

170
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:47,754
Damn things look like
they're right out of space nuts.

171
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:50,449
Maybe N-guy has one,
you got one, N-guy?

172
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:02,131
Hey, look, Patty, it's that N-guy.

173
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:08,944
N-guy, N-guy.

174
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,060
Hey,

175
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:22,205
What do you think you're doing?

176
00:09:22,473 --> 00:09:23,975
I just need some aspirin.

177
00:09:24,592 --> 00:09:27,514
You aren't welcome in this store, N-guy.

178
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:31,270
Fine.

179
00:09:36,432 --> 00:09:40,709
Principal Victoria, I'm very concerned
about the behavior of one of your students.

180
00:09:40,897 --> 00:09:44,356
Yes, we apologize
for Eric Cartman's behavior, Mr. Nelson.

181
00:09:44,357 --> 00:09:45,688
We feel terrible.

182
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,941
Why? I don't feel terrible.

183
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,496
It doesn't bother me at all.

184
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,379
Words are like bullets
and I let them pass right through me.

185
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,630
I just know that with some
one-on-one time together with this

186
00:09:55,684 --> 00:09:59,156
Eric Cartman, I have a chance
to change the way he thinks.

187
00:10:00,938 --> 00:10:04,920
It might be best if you just let it go,
OK?

188
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:08,165
You don't understand.
You see, words are like bullets

189
00:10:08,332 --> 00:10:12,260
- and if you take away the gun powder--
- Yeah, yeah, we get it, Mr. Nelson.

190
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:14,124
Very well, Mr. Nelson.

191
00:10:14,137 --> 00:10:17,047
Stacy, go ahead
and please send in Eric Cartman.

192
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:29,536
Eric, Mr. Nelson is concerned
how you respond to little people.

193
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:33,679
Oh, did I hurt his little feelings?

194
00:10:34,931 --> 00:10:38,096
You know, think you have the power
to make me insecure,

195
00:10:38,109 --> 00:10:40,361
but your words are actually
completely powerless.

196
00:10:40,362 --> 00:10:44,174
We should get like eight of these and
dress them up like little beavers, right?

197
00:10:44,214 --> 00:10:46,695
and put them in a pond
and see if they build a dam!

198
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:54,069
You see, no matter what you say,
I'm still standing.

199
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,147
Barely!

200
00:10:56,837 --> 00:10:59,492
No matter how you act,
I can rise above it

201
00:10:58,548 --> 00:10:59,571
Rise above it !

202
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:01,227
Rise above it,

203
00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:04,765
Get it like he can rise
above anything !

204
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:06,491
Shut your [bleep] mouth.

205
00:11:06,656 --> 00:11:08,183
M. Nelson !

206
00:11:11,778 --> 00:11:13,012
He didn't get to me.

207
00:11:13,397 --> 00:11:15,135
I was just joking.

208
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:20,677
Look, look how his face gets
red he's like a little strawbury !

209
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:33,511
Words with venom,
words that bind,

210
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,094
words used like weapons
to cloud my mind.

211
00:11:36,866 --> 00:11:38,606
I'm a person, i'm a man,

212
00:11:39,017 --> 00:11:40,720
but no mater how hard i try,

213
00:11:41,424 --> 00:11:44,689
people just say, hey,
there goes that n-guy.

214
00:11:46,868 --> 00:11:48,500
Everywhere i go it's
always the same,

215
00:11:48,653 --> 00:11:50,357
I can't get away from
that terrible name.

216
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:52,824
Hey, n-guy, n-guy, n-guy stop !

217
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:56,339
Now go !

218
00:11:56,562 --> 00:11:58,441
Call me n-guy,
fill me with your hate,

219
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:00,625
try to bring me down, oh,
you're too late.

220
00:12:00,942 --> 00:12:02,339
Someone just beat you to it,

221
00:12:02,832 --> 00:12:04,312
but my dream will not die.

222
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:06,496
To be thought of as more

223
00:12:07,506 --> 00:12:09,490
than just n-guy.

224
00:12:13,427 --> 00:12:14,437
Respect.

225
00:12:17,525 --> 00:12:18,558
Token, hey, wait up.

226
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,482
I just wanted to say
i get it now.

227
00:12:21,646 --> 00:12:24,428
You know, after that little person
talked at that assembly the day.

228
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:27,355
I understand how you feel about
somebody saying the n-word.

229
00:12:29,032 --> 00:12:31,181
So black people are midgets ?

230
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:34,016
Dammit !

231
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,282
Excuse me, over here please !

232
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,701
I need all students to
join me over here.

233
00:12:39,781 --> 00:12:43,891
I've called you here because it's time
at that we taught Eric Cartman a lesson

234
00:12:44,185 --> 00:12:45,218
once and for all.

235
00:12:46,052 --> 00:12:48,118
And in a few seconds
Eric will be sent in,

236
00:12:48,271 --> 00:12:49,574
when we walk through that door

237
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:54,153
i want you al at the same
time to yell hello, fatso.

238
00:12:56,414 --> 00:12:58,234
I don't think that's a
very good idea, sir.

239
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,756
He has to learn his lesson,
you see, words are like bullets.

240
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:03,639
All right, all right,
here he comes.

241
00:13:07,643 --> 00:13:09,263
Good morning fatso !

242
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,846
Hey, what the hell is that ?

243
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:13,449
You think [bleep] funny?

244
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:15,304
cal, did you put
everybody up to this.

245
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,547
I bet you did, what
the hell is going on !

246
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:20,154
Now you know how it feels!

247
00:13:26,964 --> 00:13:29,553
You didn't like it when the
tables were turned, did you ?

248
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:31,701
All right, all right, who is
the freakin' genius

249
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:34,097
who dressed up in little
suspenders, is that you ?

250
00:13:34,825 --> 00:13:36,010
You can't get to this.

251
00:13:36,234 --> 00:13:37,842
Words are like bullets !

252
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,909
And so it's my honor

253
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:44,742
to announce today the randy marsh
African-American scholarship foundation.

254
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:49,715
It is my hope that this
foundation will prove

255
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:53,595
my commitment to the education
of African-American students

256
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:55,966
and erase once and for all

257
00:13:56,453 --> 00:13:59,653
my identity as the n-guy.

258
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:02,900
You really,

259
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:06,701
realy don't know how hard it is to
be constantly reminded of something

260
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,610
lame that happened in your past.

261
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:13,708
I just want to move on from what
happened on wheel of fortune, you know.

262
00:14:14,506 --> 00:14:16,890
When people call me n-guy,

263
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:19,561
they're bringing up had a
painful chapter of my history

264
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,669
and the negativity that
went along with it.

265
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:25,579
You just, you can't
imagine how that feels.

266
00:14:29,054 --> 00:14:30,311
Is this n-guy serious ?

267
00:14:31,109 --> 00:14:32,841
Anyway, here is to a
new start for us all,

268
00:14:32,994 --> 00:14:34,009
thank you !

269
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,424
Hey, look, Skeeter, that's
that guy from the tv.

270
00:14:44,835 --> 00:14:46,232
Well, well, well !

271
00:14:46,408 --> 00:14:48,780
Looks like we got
ourselves a n-guy.

272
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,753
Whoa !

273
00:15:03,857 --> 00:15:05,653
Where you going, n-guy ?

274
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:08,107
Please, i don't
want any trouble.

275
00:15:08,681 --> 00:15:10,137
Well, you got trouble !

276
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:13,395
When you first decided to slander
an entire race of people

277
00:15:13,554 --> 00:15:14,887
on wheel of fortune.

278
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,473
Yeah, you like making fun
of minorities, n-guy ?

279
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:21,714
We don't take kindly
to social ignorance.

280
00:15:21,884 --> 00:15:23,810
You tell him Skeeter, tell him !

281
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,359
What do you want?

282
00:15:25,706 --> 00:15:27,080
What do we want ?

283
00:15:29,057 --> 00:15:32,627
We want to live in a world
without people like you who are

284
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,729
intolerant of African-Americans.

285
00:15:35,774 --> 00:15:36,807
Leave him alone.

286
00:15:39,144 --> 00:15:41,738
Hey, that's that other n-guy.

287
00:15:42,654 --> 00:15:46,177
that's the guy from seinfeld used
the n-word a whole bunch of times.

288
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,633
Michael richards,

289
00:15:47,997 --> 00:15:49,887
well, sonofabitch.

290
00:15:50,263 --> 00:15:52,071
looks like it's our lucky day,

291
00:15:52,423 --> 00:15:54,971
we done got us two n-guys.

292
00:15:55,717 --> 00:15:57,044
Make that three.

293
00:15:57,948 --> 00:15:59,503
- Mark Fuhrman.
- who ?

294
00:15:59,656 --> 00:16:02,269
He done said the n-word
in the oj case.

295
00:16:02,603 --> 00:16:04,670
What is this a n-guy convention ?

296
00:16:06,913 --> 00:16:08,932
We aren't being pushed
around anymore.

297
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:10,271
Leave !

298
00:16:11,427 --> 00:16:12,461
Come on, Skeeter,

299
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:14,668
these n-guys ain't
worth our trouble.

300
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,872
Damn n-guys, we will be back !

301
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:24,725
You better come with us.

302
00:16:26,145 --> 00:16:28,318
come on in, mr. marsh,
we'll make you coffee.

303
00:16:28,684 --> 00:16:29,693
What's going on here.

304
00:16:30,128 --> 00:16:32,911
We've been following your story
since we first saw it on the news,

305
00:16:33,234 --> 00:16:35,312
don't worry you're
with friends now.

306
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:38,770
Dale here used the n-word
in a racial joke at word.

307
00:16:39,175 --> 00:16:42,004
Scott used the plural n-word to
refer to a group of gardeners

308
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,179
who broke his fence.

309
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:45,832
They were mexicans,
i was being ironic.

310
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:48,539
We're all just like you.

311
00:16:48,844 --> 00:16:52,144
No, no, no, i'm sorry,
i'm not like you,

312
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,155
i just said the n-word
by mistake to win money.

313
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:58,819
I made a mistake too,
i was trying to be funny !

314
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:02,189
I got frustrated and thought i
would get some shock laughs.

315
00:17:02,447 --> 00:17:03,457
I'm just,

316
00:17:03,785 --> 00:17:06,450
not that god after comedian if
you want to know the real truth.

317
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:09,316
You said the n-word to
a black man's face,

318
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,872
that's way worse than what i did.

319
00:17:11,553 --> 00:17:13,420
You really think that matters

320
00:17:15,063 --> 00:17:17,787
you really think all those people
out there see a difference ?

321
00:17:18,844 --> 00:17:20,887
Oh, they might see your
racial slur was more

322
00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:23,024
accidental they might
even laugh about it,

323
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:25,165
but at the end of the day,

324
00:17:25,893 --> 00:17:28,958
all you are to them is just
an another damn n-guy.

325
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:35,046
- Oh, you don't like that, do you ?
- No.

326
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:37,071
Randy, we want you to join us.

327
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:40,746
We have a plan to make this all
go away once and for all.

328
00:17:45,694 --> 00:17:46,509
Now, look, token,

329
00:17:46,697 --> 00:17:48,588
i've done everything i
can to make this right.

330
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,184
You have no reason
to still be mad.

331
00:17:50,344 --> 00:17:51,562
I have every reason to be mad.

332
00:17:51,718 --> 00:17:52,716
You just don't get it.

333
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:54,588
I'm not responsible
for what my dad did.

334
00:17:54,894 --> 00:17:57,148
No, you can't pretend
is never happened.

335
00:17:57,406 --> 00:17:59,156
- What do you want from me.
- Nothing.

336
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:01,410
- Stop being mad.
- No !

337
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,371
Fellas, come quick,

338
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,202
Cartman is going to
fight the midget !

339
00:18:14,931 --> 00:18:16,328
Hey, come on!

340
00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:18,200
Dude, you sure you
want to do this ?

341
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:20,397
Apparently this guy has a
black belt in karate.

342
00:18:20,555 --> 00:18:21,706
He's a midget, dudes.

343
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:26,654
I'm going to beat the crap
out of this kid to prove a talk.

344
00:18:27,521 --> 00:18:30,480
Hey, it isn't fair i'll
laugh too much.

345
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,101
Senators,

346
00:18:47,454 --> 00:18:51,281
I know it's not normally considered
American to ban words,

347
00:18:51,915 --> 00:18:54,769
but there is one slur that's
caused so much damage

348
00:18:55,144 --> 00:18:58,138
that we believe it should
finally be made illegal.

349
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,565
I'm talking of course
about the term n-guy.

350
00:19:04,127 --> 00:19:05,219
N-guy ?

351
00:19:05,571 --> 00:19:08,624
Two words which by themselves can
be harmless, but which together

352
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,090
form a verbal missile of hate.

353
00:19:11,348 --> 00:19:12,487
Yeah, that's right.

354
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,886
Oh, sure, some people
use the term in guest,

355
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,904
tell a n-guy joke or two,

356
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,715
They use the excuse for violence.

357
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,440
The damn n-guy is trying
to be political now.

358
00:19:27,974 --> 00:19:28,996
Senators,

359
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:33,028
i've learned to admit I'm capable of
having slightly racist thoughts

360
00:19:33,194 --> 00:19:34,162
once in a while.

361
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:35,876
can anybody say they never do,

362
00:19:36,493 --> 00:19:39,804
how long before you're all
called n-guys ?

363
00:19:42,035 --> 00:19:45,029
Hold on a second, are you
suggesting that n-guy could

364
00:19:45,188 --> 00:19:47,589
become a slur that refers
to all white people ?

365
00:19:48,152 --> 00:19:51,358
I'm certainly not a n-guy i've
never thought a racist thought.

366
00:19:51,722 --> 00:19:54,281
Oh, come on you're the
biggest n-guy in washington.

367
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:57,099
Mr. Marsh, we see now the
importance of your bill.

368
00:19:57,381 --> 00:19:59,518
All those in favor to
ban the term n-guy.

369
00:19:59,706 --> 00:20:01,233
- Aye.
- Opposed in.

370
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:02,721
Nay.

371
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:05,125
The motion is passed !

372
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:09,833
All right!

373
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,115
We did it !

374
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,878
For the first time in American history

375
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:17,495
a word has been officially
banned from use.

376
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:21,223
From now on, if a person
uses the word n-word,

377
00:20:21,617 --> 00:20:24,971
it must be seven away from
words away from the word guy.

378
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:30,230
Tom, it appears that the n-guy epidemic

379
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:32,297
oh, dammit, i said it, didn't I ?

380
00:20:36,063 --> 00:20:39,436
Oh, ow, ow, okay, okay, you win!

381
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:42,784
- Say uncle !
- Uncle !

382
00:20:43,461 --> 00:20:45,621
Now say carolyn,
don't go into the light.

383
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,026
Carolyn, don't go
into the light !

384
00:20:50,402 --> 00:20:51,633
Man, that's hysterical!

385
00:20:53,521 --> 00:20:56,273
There, now you all see

386
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,049
that I am not limited by my size !

387
00:21:01,604 --> 00:21:03,201
I have proven my point.

388
00:21:03,544 --> 00:21:05,000
My work here is done.

389
00:21:07,786 --> 00:21:08,828
What was his point ?

390
00:21:09,438 --> 00:21:10,554
I have no idea.

391
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:13,143
- Dude, I don't get it.
- I don't get it either.

392
00:21:14,129 --> 00:21:15,632
Wait a minute.
That's it.

393
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:17,264
I don't get it.

394
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:21,045
Don't you see, kyle,
I don't get it !

395
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,654
Token, i get it now.
I don't get it.

396
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,821
I've been trying to say that i
understand how you feel,

397
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:29,456
but I'll never understand.

398
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,709
I'm never really get how
it feels for a black person

399
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:33,185
to have somebody use the n-word,

400
00:21:33,449 --> 00:21:34,472
I don't get it.

401
00:21:35,364 --> 00:21:36,714
Now you get it Stan.

402
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,870
Yeah, I totally don't get it.

403
00:21:39,351 --> 00:21:40,361
Thanks, dude.
