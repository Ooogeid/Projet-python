00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,416
South Park - Season 11 Episode 4
"The Snuke"

2
00:00:37,132 --> 00:00:39,645
All right,
students, let's take our seats.

3
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,307
Everyone try to be nice because
we have a new student joining us today,

4
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:47,493
and I know you'll all
make him feel welcome.

5
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,780
Say hello to...
Bahir Hassan Abdul Hakeem.

6
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:55,116
Uh oh !

7
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,349
- Welcome to our class, Bahir.
- Thank you.

8
00:00:58,432 --> 00:01:00,038
Duhude, dude, not cool !

9
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:02,775
Why don't you take a seat
in Kyle's empty desk for now ?

10
00:01:02,776 --> 00:01:03,800
Okay.

11
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:08,920
Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo.

12
00:01:09,298 --> 00:01:12,378
- Eric, what the hell is wrong with you ? !
- What's wrong ? ?

13
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:15,989
- Has he been checked for bombs ?
- Eric, that's enough !

14
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:18,490
Not all Muslim people are terrorists !

15
00:01:18,655 --> 00:01:22,230
No, but most of them are.
And all it takes is most of them.

16
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:29,357
Now you go, Bahir.

17
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,358
- Yeah ?
- Kyle, are you on your computer ?

18
00:01:45,512 --> 00:01:47,246
What ? No, I'm sick.

19
00:01:47,247 --> 00:01:49,449
Get online.
I need you to check something for me.

20
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,620
Dude, leave me alone.

21
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:53,099
Kyle, every one of our friends
might be in serious danger !

22
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:56,026
- What ? Why ?
- Get online now !

23
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:57,654
All right, all right.

24
00:01:59,942 --> 00:02:04,001
Go to MySpace. See if there's
a MySpace page for a Bahir Hakeem.

25
00:02:05,243 --> 00:02:06,442
Bahir Hakeem.

26
00:02:06,443 --> 00:02:09,566
Born in Chicago, eight years old,
his favorite color is green...

27
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:11,063
Cartman, what is this all about ?

28
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,871
Kyle, I want you
to check his buddy list.

29
00:02:12,872 --> 00:02:15,954
- How many MySpace friends does he have ?
- Over a hundred.

30
00:02:15,955 --> 00:02:18,916
Look further down the page.
Does he list his favorite band ?

31
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:20,438
White Stripes

32
00:02:20,817 --> 00:02:22,539
- That's funny.
- What ?

33
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,979
He told everyone in class today
his favorite band was Blink-182.

34
00:02:37,182 --> 00:02:38,256
Hello ?

35
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:41,666
Officer Barbrady, South Park
Elementary is in serious danger !

36
00:02:42,008 --> 00:02:43,582
From what ? Who is this ?

37
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,708
I've just ID'd a Muslim and
his MySpace page does not check out.

38
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,676
You've got to get these
people out of here now !

39
00:02:49,618 --> 00:02:50,869
Are you serious ?

40
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,423
If I wasn't serious,
would I be talking like this ?

41
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:54,304
Like what ?

42
00:02:54,305 --> 00:02:56,825
Whispering, but whispering
really loudly for dramatic effect.

43
00:02:56,826 --> 00:02:58,516
Oh jeez.

44
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:03,048
What the hell ? ?

45
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,918
<i>All students are to evacuate
the school immediately !</i>

46
00:03:11,047 --> 00:03:14,835
Hey, Bahir, uh since we get to go home,
you wanna come over uh, play checkers ?

47
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:17,124
- Sure, okay.
- All right !

48
00:03:19,354 --> 00:03:20,534
Dude.

49
00:03:23,644 --> 00:03:24,455
Yeah.

50
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:27,056
Dude, I just got an IM from
Stan that they evacuated the school.

51
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:29,181
Yeah. Now do you believe
me somethin' is goin' on ? !

52
00:03:29,182 --> 00:03:30,193
I guess so.

53
00:03:30,194 --> 00:03:33,011
- I don't like it. It doesn't follow !
- What doesn't follow ?

54
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,252
Why would a terrorist just
blow up a school ? It's not their M.O.

55
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:37,502
Unless...

56
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:41,488
Oh my God ! Unless this
was all just a big diversion.

57
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,677
Kyle, I need you to Google-search
the South Park Chamber of Commerce !

58
00:03:44,678 --> 00:03:45,444
Okay.

59
00:03:45,445 --> 00:03:47,379
Their Web site should
have a calendar of events

60
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,479
is there anything big
going on in town today ? !

61
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,545
- Yeah. Actually, there is.
- What ?

62
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:53,598
There's a Hillary Clinton
campaign rally.

63
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:56,497
Cartman ? ...Cartman ?

64
00:03:59,474 --> 00:04:02,679
Sir ! There's somebody calling in saying
there's going to be a terrorist attack

65
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,760
on the Hillary Clinton rally today.

66
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:05,728
What ? ?

67
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,107
This is CIA head, Alan Thompson.

68
00:04:08,108 --> 00:04:10,510
Mr. Thompson,
you have to call off the Clinton rally !

69
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:11,984
There's a terrorist in South Park !

70
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,215
- What do you know ?
- He just showed up out of the blue !

71
00:04:14,216 --> 00:04:16,111
I need to speak with
the President right away !

72
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:18,486
I'm the head of the CIA !
You can tell me !

73
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:20,287
I said I will only
talk to the President !

74
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:22,448
Look, if you have information
of a threat, you could-

75
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:23,639
LALALALALALALALA !

76
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,925
- I will have you arrested for-
- LALALA-I can't hear you !

77
00:04:25,926 --> 00:04:27,993
Only the President ! LALALALALALA !

78
00:04:30,443 --> 00:04:32,382
Call is coming through now,
Mr. President.

79
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,663
- Hello ?
- President Bush, this is Eric Cartman !

80
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,740
- Are we on a secure line ?
- Huh ? Who ?

81
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:38,661
Look, I know you're
not the biggest Hildog fan,

82
00:04:38,662 --> 00:04:40,291
but she is in great danger right now !

83
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:41,365
Hildog ?

84
00:04:45,247 --> 00:04:48,221
Yes, I understand.
I'll let Ms. Clinton know.

85
00:04:48,504 --> 00:04:50,278
- What is it, Brian ?
- Ms. Clinton,

86
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:54,084
we just received word of a possible
terrorist attack on your rally today.

87
00:04:54,244 --> 00:04:55,754
Is the threat credible ?

88
00:04:55,807 --> 00:04:58,492
We aren't sure, but...
perhaps it's best we call it off.

89
00:04:58,493 --> 00:04:59,243
No.

90
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,152
No, I will not be bullied
by terrorist threats.

91
00:05:02,153 --> 00:05:03,816
Your men do a good job, Brian.

92
00:05:03,817 --> 00:05:06,792
I have faith that any threat
will be taken care of accordingly.

93
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,411
We've reached the rally site, Hildog.

94
00:05:12,543 --> 00:05:15,358
Don't worry, Mrs. Clinton,
I'm sure everything will be fine.

95
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,609
Thank you, Chris.

96
00:05:20,435 --> 00:05:22,453
They know about the bomb !

97
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:24,689
That is impossible !

98
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,974
We took every measure to assure
the bomb was hidden from sight.

99
00:05:27,975 --> 00:05:30,400
Well somebody tipped off the CIA.

100
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:33,356
I don't know how much they know,
but security has been heightened.

101
00:05:33,357 --> 00:05:36,199
That bomb must travel with
the Clinton rally to Boston !

102
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:38,970
The bomb won't make it to Boston now !

103
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,684
With the heightened security, it's only
a matter of time before they find it !

104
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:47,160
Then we have no choice.
We have to move up the attack.

105
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:50,264
- I understand, comrade.
- Prepare yourself.

106
00:05:50,265 --> 00:05:53,827
We detonate the bomb... within the hour.

107
00:05:58,511 --> 00:06:01,377
Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site,
but there's no sign of that kid !

108
00:06:01,426 --> 00:06:03,791
- So then maybe you're wrong.
- Nope, I'm not wrong.

109
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:05,952
He must be somehow attacking
remotely from his house.

110
00:06:05,953 --> 00:06:07,399
- Did you find the address ?
- Yeah.

111
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,562
I cross-referenced his
MySpace page with Realtor.com.

112
00:06:09,563 --> 00:06:11,885
His parents moved into that
green house on Janice Street.

113
00:06:11,886 --> 00:06:13,486
Jesus, that's on the other side of town.

114
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:16,007
All right, Kyle, I'm gonna
take a picture with my camera phone

115
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,997
and upload it to you. You ready ?
- Yeah.

116
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:25,249
- What is that ?
- It's my balls !

117
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,129
Goddamnit Cartman !

118
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:30,193
Okay. Okay, Kyle,
let's stay focused here.

119
00:06:30,798 --> 00:06:32,969
People of South Park, it is my honor

120
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,297
to introduce a woman who
deserves nothing but respect.

121
00:06:36,392 --> 00:06:38,670
Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton !

122
00:06:42,822 --> 00:06:48,699
It is so nice to be back in
a small town like the one I came from.

123
00:06:50,622 --> 00:06:51,861
Hildog !

124
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,589
Otis Green,
anything on that bomb threat ?

125
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,233
We have the bomb-sniffing
pig going through the crowd.

126
00:06:58,234 --> 00:07:00,003
If there is a bomb,
the pig will find it.

127
00:07:03,838 --> 00:07:07,554
This is why I campaign
in small towns like these !

128
00:07:07,555 --> 00:07:13,231
Because it is in towns like South Park
that you find the true America !

129
00:07:18,822 --> 00:07:21,229
- Oh my God, she got a scent !
- What ? !

130
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,481
The pig is picking up
the smell of nuclear residue.

131
00:07:23,482 --> 00:07:24,947
Terrorists have hidden a bomb !

132
00:07:24,948 --> 00:07:27,767
Oh my God ! Where ? !
Where could they have stashed it ? !

133
00:07:27,768 --> 00:07:29,750
Come on, find it. Find !

134
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:32,652
- My God, they hid it under the stage ? !
- No wait, look.

135
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:35,522
How much money do we have
to waste on needless spendin'

136
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:38,045
when we should be focusing
all our attention on...

137
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:39,310
Uh...

138
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:42,906
on the education of all-

139
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,596
Whoa there, girl.

140
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,124
on the education of all children.

141
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:52,663
Oh, I declare !

142
00:07:52,664 --> 00:07:54,209
Oh my God.

143
00:07:54,327 --> 00:07:58,551
Do you think they could have hidden
a nuclear device up Mrs. Clinton's...

144
00:07:58,764 --> 00:08:01,618
Mr. Thompson, the kid who
called in the warning was right !

145
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,966
We uncovered intel that terrorists
have obtained a nuclear device,

146
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:08,344
and that they have most likely
hidden it in Mrs. Clinton's...

147
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,150
- well, in her...
- In her what ?

148
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:14,147
In her snatch, sir.

149
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:15,575
WHAT ? ?

150
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:18,135
What is goin' on ? I wasn't finished.

151
00:08:18,136 --> 00:08:21,186
Security measure, Mrs. Clinton.
Probably nothing.

152
00:08:21,522 --> 00:08:22,347
Yes.

153
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:25,145
Mr. Jeffries,
this is Alan Thompson with the CIA.

154
00:08:25,146 --> 00:08:28,819
We have reason to believe that
Mrs. Clinton may have a nuclear device

155
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,423
up her snatch.

156
00:08:30,424 --> 00:08:32,370
- A what ? !
- A snatch.

157
00:08:32,371 --> 00:08:34,470
It's the technical term for vagina.

158
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,227
No, I mean what kind of nuclear device ? !

159
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,792
Mr. Jeffries, this is Frank Waters.

160
00:08:39,793 --> 00:08:43,331
It's a suitcase nuke,
designed to fit in a woman's snizz.

161
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:44,877
It's called a snuke.

162
00:08:45,132 --> 00:08:46,771
What is goin' on, Brian ?

163
00:08:46,772 --> 00:08:50,312
Ms. Clinton, it appears that terrorists
have snuck a snuke up your snizz.

164
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:52,224
Oh my !

165
00:08:52,225 --> 00:08:54,594
What do we do ?
Can we disable the timer ?

166
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:57,557
It won't have a timer.
Snukes are detonated remotely.

167
00:08:57,558 --> 00:09:00,246
Whoever our terrorist
is has a detonator with him.

168
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:03,645
- But then that means...
- Yes. If we don't find that detonator,

169
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:07,091
everyone in the town
of South Park is going to die.

170
00:09:07,551 --> 00:09:09,179
For-ever.

171
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:18,596
- Do we have that phone trace ?
- The call is going through now, sir.

172
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,178
- Yeah ?
- This is CIA head Alan Thompson.

173
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:24,161
- We spoke before about the-
- Yes, Mr. Thompson ?

174
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:27,122
- Well, we've just arrived in your town.
- Why ? Did you find something ?

175
00:09:27,123 --> 00:09:30,710
Yes. There's a suitcase
nuke in Ms. Clinton's snizz.

176
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:33,431
- A snuke ?
- That's right.

177
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:35,235
It's controlled by a remote detonator.

178
00:09:35,236 --> 00:09:37,608
We have to locate the terrorist
before he sets it off.

179
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:39,929
I have the address of the
house the terrorist moved into.

180
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,374
I'm almost there now; where are you ?

181
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,283
We're on the town's main street,
right by an ice cream shop.

182
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,277
Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you.

183
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:48,483
Oh, hey.

184
00:09:50,017 --> 00:09:52,206
- Dude, we totally got let out of school.
- I know.

185
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:54,217
Something big is going on.
Take a look at this.

186
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,938
I did a Google search for "Hillary
Clinton Campaign Rally" right ?

187
00:09:56,939 --> 00:09:58,441
And one of the links was to YouTube,

188
00:09:58,442 --> 00:10:00,457
where this Russian
guy had a bunch of videos.

189
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,207
- Russian ?
- Yeah, this guy. Vladimir Stolfsky.

190
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,484
He had videos on YouTube
of every single rally.

191
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:07,409
- So he's a Hillary Clinton fan.
- No.

192
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,850
I cross-referenced his
YouTube profile with MySpace,

193
00:10:09,851 --> 00:10:12,331
and according to his blog,
he's an old-school Communist.

194
00:10:12,332 --> 00:10:14,791
So what's he doing
at every Clinton rally ?

195
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:17,577
Do a WebCrawler search: maybe
he has podcasts up somewhere.

196
00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:19,051
Oh that's a good idea.

197
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:22,992
What is going on ? ? What have we done ? ?

198
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,478
They claim they don't
know anything about an attack.

199
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:26,637
Big surprise !

200
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:30,212
Sir, first pass of the house, we
didn't find a snuke detonator anywhere.

201
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,336
Mr. Hakeem, where is your son ?

202
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:35,370
We thought he was at school.
He's not at school ?

203
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:38,426
You're doing great, Ms. Clinton.

204
00:10:38,427 --> 00:10:42,780
Do they know how long, Brian ? How long
before the snuke in my snizz goes off ?

205
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,093
They'll find the detonator, Hildog.

206
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,488
We can't wait for them
to find the detonator.

207
00:10:47,535 --> 00:10:50,626
If we can get to the bomb,
me-maybe we can deactivate it.

208
00:10:50,627 --> 00:10:54,061
Can't somebody go and take
a look inside Mrs. Clinton's snizz ?

209
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,684
I'm not sending any of my men in there.

210
00:10:58,746 --> 00:11:01,389
Are you almost ready
to set off the bomb ?

211
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,693
Everything is set.
We have the detonator up and running.

212
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:12,031
Mr. Hakeem,
we need to know where your son is !

213
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:13,825
I tell you, I do not know.

214
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,265
This is getting us nowhere.
If he knows anything, he's not saying.

215
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:21,850
- Let me have time with him.
- What are you going to do ?

216
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:25,024
We have to find that detonator !
Let me have time with him !

217
00:11:27,596 --> 00:11:31,006
- You will tell me where your son is !
- He should be at school !

218
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:39,435
Hey !

219
00:11:41,176 --> 00:11:44,032
- Where is the detonator ? !
- Wuh-what detonator are you ta-

220
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:50,320
- I can do this aaall day.
- I don't know anything about a-

221
00:11:54,427 --> 00:11:56,338
Stop it ! Really !

222
00:11:56,421 --> 00:11:58,839
- You can make it stop !
- I don't have the-

223
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:03,559
Are we just gonna let this go on ? ?

224
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,516
Okay, I got a text of
the Russian guy's podcast.

225
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,933
It's all a bunch of links to eBay.

226
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:09,934
You should be able to
search his username on eBay

227
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:11,844
and see what he's
been buying and selling.

228
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:14,804
Ferris, set up over there.
Two of you can take that bed area.

229
00:12:14,805 --> 00:12:17,129
- Hey.
- Donner, take over that station.

230
00:12:17,993 --> 00:12:19,038
What's going on ?

231
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,344
This apartment is being
absorbed by Homeland Security !

232
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:24,160
...Homeland Security ?

233
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:26,827
Look, your little game of
goin' over people's heads is over !

234
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:29,870
You could still work, but from
now on you answer to ME, you got that ? !

235
00:12:29,871 --> 00:12:32,407
- 'Scuse me, who's in charge here ? !
- I am !

236
00:12:32,408 --> 00:12:34,059
Yeah well not anymore you're not.

237
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,165
This apartment has just
been assigned to the FBI.

238
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,926
That's outrageous ! On whose orders ? !

239
00:12:37,927 --> 00:12:41,493
On order of the Secretary of Defense !
You had your shot, now I'm in charge !

240
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,958
Not anymore you're not !

241
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,755
Orders just came down from Central ! They
want ATF handling this on all fronts !

242
00:12:46,756 --> 00:12:49,056
All right people,
from now on you're answering to me !

243
00:12:49,057 --> 00:12:50,862
Not anymore they're not !

244
00:12:50,863 --> 00:12:54,333
Orders from the President: he wants
this handled by his staff personally !

245
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:55,894
Now Nelson is in charge.

246
00:12:55,895 --> 00:12:58,051
Not anymore I'm not !

247
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:02,654
What are you going to do to my wife ? !

248
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:05,107
Nothing...
if you tell me where your son is !

249
00:13:05,108 --> 00:13:07,137
We told you: we don't know.

250
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:08,758
Do you know what this is ? !

251
00:13:10,313 --> 00:13:14,065
This... is apple juice.
It gives me super bad farts.

252
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:17,852
Did he just inject
himself with apple juice ?

253
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:20,672
- Where is your son ? !
- She doesn't know either.

254
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,595
I mean it ! Stop ! That is disgusting !
Where is your mother ? !

255
00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:31,894
Answer it !

256
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:36,059
Hallo ? Hallo Bahir. Where are you ?

257
00:13:36,861 --> 00:13:39,256
- Who it But-ters ?
- Butters !

258
00:13:39,374 --> 00:13:41,887
Bahir, one of your classmates
is keeping us hostage.

259
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:47,162
You filthy little rapscallion !

260
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:48,645
We got him ! I know where he is !

261
00:13:48,646 --> 00:13:50,415
All right, where ?
We'll send our people in.

262
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,847
No no, he's my lead.

263
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:53,312
You're not going alone.

264
00:13:53,313 --> 00:13:56,487
You blow in there and you risk taking
him down without finding the detonator !

265
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:58,300
I'm going to find out where it is !

266
00:13:59,185 --> 00:14:02,542
All right, people, I'm in charge
now and we will find the terrorists.

267
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:05,743
Jarvis, I want you to check
for any terrorist chatter on AOL.

268
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:09,833
Marley and Greggs, try searching
for nuclear devices on AskJeeves.com.

269
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:12,676
Ask Jeeves ? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves !
Just Google-search it !

270
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:14,376
Are you tellin' me how to do my job ?

271
00:14:14,377 --> 00:14:16,778
Yes. There's a Russian
guy named Vladimir Stolfsky

272
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:18,899
who's got search engine
hits all over this thing.

273
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,853
Chase, search the
name Stolfsky on YouTube

274
00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:22,759
and cross-reference it with JDate !

275
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,718
Checking.

276
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:26,079
Look, these Russian guys
all have blogs talking about this

277
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,520
like it's just some big diversion
for something much bigger !

278
00:14:28,521 --> 00:14:31,001
Sir, these kids are right.
We've just received intel

279
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:33,932
that Russian terrorists are believed
to be responsible for the threat.

280
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:36,962
- Where's the intel from ?
- We just read it on Drudge Report.

281
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:38,465
Look, we already have the guy's blog.

282
00:14:38,466 --> 00:14:40,869
Maybe we can find an address
and check it out on MapQuest.

283
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,280
We do this my way !
I'm the one in charge !

284
00:14:44,338 --> 00:14:47,666
- ...Not anymore you're not.
- Oh, snap.

285
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,560
Whoopee ! I captured another
one of your pieces, Bahir.

286
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:56,268
Oh hey Eric.

287
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:58,215
- Where is the detonator !
- The what ?

288
00:14:58,216 --> 00:14:59,575
You have exactly five seconds

289
00:14:59,576 --> 00:15:02,336
before I start dropping serious
apple juice farts on your face !

290
00:15:02,337 --> 00:15:04,835
- One !
- Leave me alone !

291
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:05,992
Stop !

292
00:15:06,275 --> 00:15:08,057
Hey, I was about to win !

293
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:10,665
Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you !

294
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,175
Get in the van !

295
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:21,060
Uh, that's cool.
I'm actually not... playing anymore.

296
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,408
Get in the van !

297
00:15:24,494 --> 00:15:26,507
That's it !
We don't have a choice anymore !

298
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:30,571
Somebody is going to have to go in,
and try to disarm the snuke manually !

299
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:32,285
No, it's too dangerous !

300
00:15:32,286 --> 00:15:36,931
That snatch has not seen action
in over 30 years ! It could be toxic !

301
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:40,837
I'll do it !
I'll check out Ms. Clinton's snizz.

302
00:15:44,718 --> 00:15:47,679
Let me go !
Please ! I am just a little boy !

303
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,712
You called and warned
the government of our plans !

304
00:15:50,776 --> 00:15:54,090
What you don't know is
that we are merely mercenaries !

305
00:15:54,091 --> 00:15:59,106
We were paid to set up the snuke so that
the real enemy of America could attack !

306
00:15:59,107 --> 00:16:01,247
That's cool.
I'm fine with Muslims invading.

307
00:16:01,307 --> 00:16:04,800
Do you really think Muslims
are behind this terrorist threat ? !

308
00:16:05,827 --> 00:16:07,773
Uhh yes, of course ?

309
00:16:07,774 --> 00:16:11,129
America had other enemies
before the Muslims, you know.

310
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,694
Who is America's oldest enemy ?

311
00:16:14,203 --> 00:16:16,364
- The Russians ?
- Before that.

312
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:19,275
- The Germans ?
- Before that !

313
00:16:19,998 --> 00:16:22,134
- The Germans again ?
- BEFORE that ! !

314
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,886
I am talking about the
oldest threat to America !

315
00:16:25,887 --> 00:16:28,954
The greatest enemy
America has ever known !

316
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:31,231
You can't possible mean... ?

317
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:38,795
Two hundred years we've waited. Finally.

318
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:41,910
We will get those traitors to the Crown !

319
00:16:43,975 --> 00:16:45,461
Yes, Your Majesty ?

320
00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:49,013
The Russians are ready
to set off the diversion.

321
00:16:49,378 --> 00:16:52,694
- Full sail.
- Full sail, Your Majesty !

322
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:05,048
All right, Brian, this is it.

323
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:08,294
Get in there and see if you can disarm
the snuke in Ms. Clinton's snatch.

324
00:17:11,244 --> 00:17:14,230
All right. I'm nearing her snizz now.

325
00:17:15,165 --> 00:17:16,473
God help him.

326
00:17:16,474 --> 00:17:19,298
- What do you see, Brian ?
- It's dark...

327
00:17:19,676 --> 00:17:20,690
cold...

328
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:23,262
You're doing fine, Brian.
Get as close as you can...

329
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:25,835
You have to look inside the snizz.

330
00:17:28,845 --> 00:17:30,520
Uh, uh, all right, I'm,looking.

331
00:17:31,606 --> 00:17:34,296
Yes, I see... I see the device !

332
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:38,273
You're doin' great, Brian.
Hang in there.

333
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:40,411
There's um, metal housing...

334
00:17:40,412 --> 00:17:43,937
some kind of three-pronged
triggering mechanism that...

335
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:48,898
Wait there's... there's something
else here ! There's something...

336
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:50,048
Say again, Brian.

337
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:53,460
There's something perched
on the snuke's coil...

338
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:55,582
Oh God, it's looking at me !

339
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:56,974
Brian, get out of there ! !

340
00:17:56,975 --> 00:18:02,409
Wha... what are you ? !
I have no qualm with you ! Stay back !

341
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,349
Stay back I- agh ! Aaagh !

342
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,214
Brian ? ? Brian, what's happening ? ?

343
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:10,816
It's... eating my head !
It's eating my head !

344
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,980
Hoh my !

345
00:18:16,258 --> 00:18:17,439
I got it ! I got it !

346
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,058
According to PayPal, the Russian
guys are just hired mercenaries

347
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:22,659
who had ads up on Craig's List
and got paid through eBay

348
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,387
so that person could be attacked by...

349
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:25,614
the British !

350
00:18:25,615 --> 00:18:28,233
- The British ?
- Loyalist Red Coats !

351
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:31,032
Sir, I found the Russian's
eHarmony account !

352
00:18:31,033 --> 00:18:32,873
It does list an address in South Park !

353
00:18:32,874 --> 00:18:34,179
All right ! MapQuest the address !

354
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,620
I'll use Google Maps,
it has live traffic.

355
00:18:36,621 --> 00:18:37,476
Good thinking.

356
00:18:37,477 --> 00:18:40,792
Sir, we have the terrorists' location.
IM'ing you now.

357
00:18:41,808 --> 00:18:43,707
It was good knowing you, comrade.

358
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,033
Please. Think about what you are doing.

359
00:18:46,034 --> 00:18:48,361
The British are just using you;
you're going to die.

360
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:51,157
Yes, but we will be rich.

361
00:18:51,158 --> 00:18:53,057
Left flank, prig prang and clear !

362
00:18:53,058 --> 00:18:55,499
Go go go go !

363
00:18:56,621 --> 00:18:58,969
The game is over !
Get down on the ground !

364
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,480
How did they find us ?

365
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:04,361
We know about everything ! Your
diversion to help the Red Coats is over !

366
00:19:04,362 --> 00:19:09,447
It doesn't matter. The detonator
is on a timer. You are too late !

367
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,620
In three minutes !

368
00:19:16,951 --> 00:19:18,567
What the hell ? !

369
00:19:18,568 --> 00:19:21,494
- The power went out !
- Well so then what time is it ?

370
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,296
Oh crap.

371
00:19:26,297 --> 00:19:27,653
Take 'em down !

372
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:35,252
No ! I don't want to
die without being paid !

373
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,133
The detonator is secured, general.
You are cleared to proceed.

374
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:53,493
The Rebel Americans know of our attack ? !

375
00:19:53,494 --> 00:19:55,948
- How ?
- Fire at will !

376
00:20:06,432 --> 00:20:07,426
Yes ?

377
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,243
Your Majesty, the attack has failed.

378
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:14,444
We were...
unable to end the American Revolution.

379
00:20:15,428 --> 00:20:16,920
I see.

380
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:25,884
Well, looks like we saved our
country from British rule once again.

381
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,312
Yeah. It just proves we need to
learn not to profile one race of people.

382
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:31,799
Because, actually,
most of the world hates us.

383
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:35,189
Well Bahir, I was thinking
that maybe I own you an apology.

384
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,024
Really ?

385
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:38,463
Yes, but then I realized that,
technically, I don't.

386
00:20:38,464 --> 00:20:41,548
Because by being suspicious of you
I saved your life and everyone else's.

387
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:44,541
So really, you own me an apology.
But that's cool.

388
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:47,048
...You didn't save everyone, I did !

389
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:49,026
You were just out harassing Muslims !

390
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:52,227
But if I hadn't called you in
the first place to check out the Muslim,

391
00:20:52,228 --> 00:20:54,610
you would have just stayed
in bed sick all day, right ?

392
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:55,550
...Maybe.

393
00:20:55,551 --> 00:20:58,391
Maybe ? If I hadn't called you,
you wouldn't have been on your computer

394
00:20:58,392 --> 00:20:59,636
checking out the Clinton rally.

395
00:20:59,637 --> 00:21:02,440
That means my intolerance
of Muslims saved America.

396
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,294
...That is so missing the point.

397
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:07,385
Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear
bomb from going off, yes or no ? !

398
00:21:07,648 --> 00:21:09,563
The-that's not the
right way to look at it, I-

399
00:21:09,564 --> 00:21:10,653
YES OR NO, KYLE ? !

400
00:21:10,654 --> 00:21:13,214
No ! ...Not... not like you're saying.

401
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,103
But that's all I'm saying: today,
bigotry and racism saved the day.

402
00:21:16,104 --> 00:21:17,507
Bahir, you get this, right ?

403
00:21:17,508 --> 00:21:20,234
Bahir ! Get away from
that disgusting child !

404
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:22,157
Get back home and start
packing your things !

405
00:21:22,158 --> 00:21:24,542
We are leaving this
whole intolerant country !

406
00:21:29,946 --> 00:21:30,951
Okay.

407
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,393
Who got rid of the Muslims, huh ?

408
00:21:33,394 --> 00:21:36,237
That was all me.
Simple thank you will suffice.

409
