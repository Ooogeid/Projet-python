South Park - Season 11 Episode 12
"Imaginationland Episode III"

2
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:38,303
<i>Imaginationland...
used to be a happy place.</i>

3
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:40,916
<i>But then the terrorists attacked,</i>

4
00:00:41,116 --> 00:00:43,694
<i>and so many of us were killed.</i>

5
00:00:43,998 --> 00:00:45,849
<i>The Barrier came down,</i>

6
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:49,989
<i>and all the most evil imaginary
characters were unleashed.</i>

7
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:53,795
<i>Now our final battle will take place.</i>

8
00:00:54,768 --> 00:00:57,724
<i>The evil characters
are marching toward us,</i>

9
00:00:58,898 --> 00:01:01,665
<i>with the intent to wipe us all out.</i>

10
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:05,351
- This is gonna be fun, huh?
- Yeah!!

11
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:09,340
<i>We prepare for a battle we cannot win.</i>

12
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:12,587
<i>Sweet and cuddly imaginary characters,</i>

13
00:01:12,787 --> 00:01:14,877
<i>many who have never held a weapon,</i>

14
00:01:15,077 --> 00:01:17,917
<i>must now fight for their very lives.</i>

15
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:20,518
<i>We are too few in number,</i>

16
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:22,701
<i>but we have one hope.</i>

17
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:25,621
That is where you come in, young boy.

18
00:01:25,883 --> 00:01:28,365
Only you can help us win this battle.

19
00:01:29,273 --> 00:01:30,669
Wuh, what can I do?

20
00:01:31,188 --> 00:01:35,047
You have a power here that
you have yet to understand.

21
00:01:38,664 --> 00:01:40,609
<i>{\Episode III}</i>

22
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,273
<i>No!</i>

23
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:49,979
Back it up!

24
00:01:51,471 --> 00:01:52,471
Look!

25
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:53,691
Right there!

26
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,192
See that?!

27
00:01:55,454 --> 00:01:56,454
<i>No!</i>

28
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:58,822
What does that look like to you?!

29
00:01:59,246 --> 00:02:00,936
It's ManBearPig!

30
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:03,164
I told you it was real!

31
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,500
Look again!

32
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:10,647
There! Half man,
half bear, and half pig!

33
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:12,293
Do you see it?!

34
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:14,837
Yes, we see it, Mr. Gore.

35
00:02:15,188 --> 00:02:16,799
Something big is going on,

36
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:19,487
and the American people
need to know what!

37
00:02:19,687 --> 00:02:20,687
I'm off!

38
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:26,181
<i>{\Washington D.C.
Memorial Hospital}</i>

39
00:02:27,602 --> 00:02:30,725
He's recovering, but there's
been some trauma to his brain.

40
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:33,955
The boy says he's been
hearing imaginary voices.

41
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:37,057
<i>Hello?</i>

42
00:02:37,796 --> 00:02:39,173
<i>Hello? Anybody?</i>

43
00:02:41,298 --> 00:02:42,298
Stan?

44
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:43,945
<i>Hello?</i>

45
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:46,151
Stan?

46
00:02:46,505 --> 00:02:48,870
Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling?

47
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,915
- Cartman, what's happened?
- What's happened?

48
00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:52,193
Well, let's see:

49
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:54,809
You bet me that I couldn't prove
leprechauns were real.

50
00:02:54,929 --> 00:02:58,131
And if I could prove it,
you had to suck my balls, I believe.

51
00:02:58,392 --> 00:03:00,133
No, I mean what happened
at the Pentagon?!

52
00:03:00,394 --> 00:03:01,894
You just rest, Kyle.

53
00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:04,619
Look what I made for you. A sundae.

54
00:03:05,274 --> 00:03:08,417
It has hot fudge and whipped
cream and a cherry- but...

55
00:03:08,617 --> 00:03:11,075
I feel like something is missing;
don't you, Kyle?

56
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:15,440
What else belongs on a sundae besides
hot fudge and whipped cream, let's see.

57
00:03:16,785 --> 00:03:18,445
Hot fudge, whipped cream,

58
00:03:18,645 --> 00:03:20,904
what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle?

59
00:03:21,165 --> 00:03:25,065
What else goes on a sundae
besides hot fudge, whipped cream, and...

60
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,743
Oh, that's right!

61
00:03:27,004 --> 00:03:28,535
My balls!

62
00:03:28,797 --> 00:03:31,456
Cartman, what is going on out there?!
What happened to Stan?!

63
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:34,596
Oh, he got sucked through that portal
thing and they're gonna nuke it now.

64
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:36,836
So are you all set for
your big photo shoot, Kyle?

65
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:38,588
Wait, what do you mean?
Stan's in danger?

66
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:40,507
Don't try to change the subject, Kyle.

67
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:43,036
You've done a really good job
of trying to get out of this bet,

68
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,046
but it's finally time to settle.

69
00:03:45,246 --> 00:03:48,246
Get ready for your sundae, Kyle.
With extra nuts.

70
00:03:51,754 --> 00:03:54,270
Aslan, the evil characters
are almost here!

71
00:03:54,531 --> 00:03:57,215
Get everyone to the battlefield!
Defend the castle walls!

72
00:03:57,415 --> 00:03:59,861
Quickly young boy,
we need your powers now!

73
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:02,194
What powers? I don't understand.

74
00:04:02,456 --> 00:04:05,378
You are real. You are a creator.

75
00:04:05,656 --> 00:04:09,120
That means you can imagine
things into existence here.

76
00:04:09,802 --> 00:04:10,883
I... I can?

77
00:04:11,181 --> 00:04:14,081
Santa Claus was killed
in the terrorist attack.

78
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:17,588
The first thing we need
is for you to bring him back.

79
00:04:18,293 --> 00:04:20,930
- How?
- You just have to focus your mind.

80
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,099
Imagine Santa and nothing else.

81
00:04:23,299 --> 00:04:25,844
How am I supposed to focus
with all this crap going on?!

82
00:04:26,105 --> 00:04:29,596
Think only of one thing.
Imagine it. Believe in it.

83
00:04:29,858 --> 00:04:33,350
Whatever is most prominent
in your mind will come to be.

84
00:04:38,123 --> 00:04:39,123
Butters!

85
00:04:39,293 --> 00:04:42,044
You are grounded, mister! You hear me?!

86
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:43,805
Grounded!!

87
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,798
No, nonono, no no no!

88
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:50,276
What are you doing?! We need Santa!

89
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,530
I'm trying!

90
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:54,746
Come on, kid, imagine Santa!
Believe in Santa!

91
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:57,082
You must believe in Santa!

92
00:04:57,344 --> 00:04:59,611
Believe in Santa!! Right now!!

93
00:05:04,977 --> 00:05:07,274
Kevin, can I get some
more bounce off that too, 'kay?

94
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:09,120
Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split.

95
00:05:09,249 --> 00:05:12,056
Cartman, will you shut up?
I'm trying to find out what's going on.

96
00:05:12,317 --> 00:05:14,517
<i>A new terrorist attack
seems to have taken place.</i>

97
00:05:14,778 --> 00:05:16,852
This time, in our imagination.

98
00:05:17,493 --> 00:05:20,134
<i>Al Gore brought this video
to the public's attention,</i>

99
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:23,943
<i>sparking demands by everyone who
wants to know exactly what's going on.</i>

100
00:05:24,451 --> 00:05:28,536
We were hoping to keep this
quiet until it was all over, but,

101
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:32,658
two days ago there was
a terrorist attack on our imagination,

102
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:36,693
and now our imaginations
are running wild.

103
00:05:38,878 --> 00:05:42,170
Our imaginations are running
wild and we weren't told?!

104
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:43,814
By attacking our imagination

105
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:46,303
the terrorists have found
our most vulnerable spot.

106
00:05:46,423 --> 00:05:48,363
And we've determined
that the best course of action

107
00:05:48,483 --> 00:05:50,385
is to nuke our imagination.

108
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,723
Is nuking our imagination
really prudent?

109
00:05:54,985 --> 00:05:58,728
Aren't there other, more peaceful ways
to get our imagination under control?

110
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:03,232
Couldn't we trying sending Kurt Russell
into a portal to our imagination and-

111
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:07,278
We tried that! And Kurt Russell
was raped by Christmas Critters!

112
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:10,152
A-ooch.

113
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:15,853
The Pentagon claims that because
imaginary things are not real,

114
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:18,957
the military doesn't need
Senate approval to nuke them.

115
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:20,822
That's bullcrap, man!

116
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:23,044
You can't nuke our imagination!

117
00:06:23,305 --> 00:06:25,869
Don't nuke our imagination bro!

118
00:06:27,602 --> 00:06:30,758
Mike, does the military have
the authority to nuke our imagination?

119
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,171
Clearly they don't, Steven, and they're
gonna have a big problem because

120
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,470
state government has
already set a precedent

121
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,392
that imaginary characters are real.

122
00:06:38,592 --> 00:06:41,604
I cite a famous case of
Cartman v. Broflovski

123
00:06:41,804 --> 00:06:44,928
in which a U.S. court found
for the plaintiff who saw a leprechaun.

124
00:06:45,128 --> 00:06:48,569
Yes, I believe the defendant had to
suck the plaintiff's balls in that case.

125
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,739
- <i>That's right, Steven, yeah.</i>
- Oh, for the love of God!

126
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,300
<i>Hello? Can anybody hear me?</i>

127
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:56,512
Stan! Dude, is that you?

128
00:06:58,052 --> 00:07:00,735
<i>Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you.</i>

129
00:07:01,002 --> 00:07:05,152
No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital.
I'm hearing you in my imagination.

130
00:07:06,765 --> 00:07:09,632
- <i>Oh that makes sense.</i>
- Dude, what's happening?

131
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:12,572
I'm in like a gumdrop forest.

132
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,080
I just saw Strawberry Shortcake
tied up and dead with pee in her eye.

133
00:07:19,383 --> 00:07:23,133
Wait, hang on. I think something
really big is about to go down.

134
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:31,042
- The evil characters are here.
- There are so many of them.

135
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,771
There's no time left!

136
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:54,849
You have to get control of your
imagination and bring Santa back now!

137
00:07:55,049 --> 00:07:57,429
Santa. Santa.

138
00:07:57,691 --> 00:08:01,058
Think. Jolly old Santa.
Red suit, white beard.

139
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,673
Red suit, white beard...

140
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,076
Santa!

141
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,988
How does that look? Can you see
my balls and the sundae in frame?

142
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:17,408
<i>A shocking new development
in the nuking of imagination!</i>

143
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:20,116
The Supreme Court has
ruled with the military

144
00:08:20,274 --> 00:08:22,631
that imaginary things
are officially not real,

145
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:25,432
and therefore no approval
is needed to nuke them.

146
00:08:25,632 --> 00:08:27,203
- Thank you.
- Oh no.

147
00:08:27,403 --> 00:08:31,288
This of course overturns any
imagination-based verdicts in the past,

148
00:08:31,488 --> 00:08:34,801
including the famous Cartman v.
Broflovski ballsucking case.

149
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:36,565
What?

150
00:08:36,685 --> 00:08:39,795
So it appears the military
is ready to proceed with its operation,

151
00:08:39,995 --> 00:08:41,238
one they are calling

152
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:45,061
"Operation Nuke the Imagination
Through the Imagination Doorway."

153
00:08:45,322 --> 00:08:47,224
<i>Kyle? What's happening?</i>

154
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:49,726
The government is gonna
nuke Imaginationland.

155
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,625
<i>What?! You can't let them do that!</i>

156
00:08:51,746 --> 00:08:54,895
- What am I supposed to do?
- <i>Dude, you have to stall them!</i>

157
00:08:55,095 --> 00:08:56,745
<i>Uh oh, what is that?</i>

158
00:08:57,099 --> 00:08:59,271
<i>Hey! Get out of here! Leave me alone!</i>

159
00:08:59,471 --> 00:09:00,970
Stan? Stan??

160
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,075
Where are you going?!

161
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:06,465
I'm going to try to save Stan
and Butters from getting nuked!

162
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:08,725
Okay, but you you have to
suck my balls first real quick.

163
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:10,795
No I don't! The decision was overturned.

164
00:09:11,307 --> 00:09:13,130
We had a deal, Kyle!!

165
00:09:13,392 --> 00:09:14,745
Yeah, that leprechauns were real!

166
00:09:14,865 --> 00:09:17,445
And the government just declared they
aren't technically real, so I was right!

167
00:09:17,565 --> 00:09:19,831
It's over!
I don't have to suck your balls!

168
00:09:20,031 --> 00:09:21,725
It isn't over!!

169
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:24,561
It isn't over, Kyle!

170
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:28,271
I have not waited this long to see
you weasel your way out of this bet!

171
00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:32,020
Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life!

172
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,390
Before this day is over!

173
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:36,992
You, will, suck my balls!

174
00:09:38,531 --> 00:09:40,277
I swear it!!

175
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,674
I need more spinach for Popeye!

176
00:09:55,732 --> 00:09:57,282
I got one. I got him.

177
00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:58,769
Hey there.

178
00:10:01,046 --> 00:10:02,304
Yeah!!

179
00:10:03,426 --> 00:10:06,642
We're losing the battle!
There are simply too many of them!

180
00:10:06,903 --> 00:10:10,174
- Then the day is lost.
- Wait! Aslan, look!

181
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,732
What? What happened?

182
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:15,859
You did it, kid!

183
00:10:16,121 --> 00:10:18,529
Quickly Santa!
They need you on the battlefield!

184
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,593
Huh? Oh, all right.

185
00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:24,743
Make way for Santa!

186
00:10:27,632 --> 00:10:30,041
Now you see your potential,
young creator.

187
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:34,452
But there is still much more we need
from you if we are to win this day!

188
00:10:38,602 --> 00:10:40,447
This area is restricted, little boy.

189
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:42,470
Please, I need to talk
to the people inside.

190
00:10:42,731 --> 00:10:43,763
They can't set off that nuke.

191
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:46,307
Get behind the line
with the other protesters!

192
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:50,187
No nukes in our imagination, bro!

193
00:10:52,324 --> 00:10:54,805
You don't understand!
My friend is in Imaginationland!

194
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:55,945
I can hear him in my head!

195
00:10:56,065 --> 00:10:59,865
You pot-smoking hippies aren't
getting through here, so back off!

196
00:11:00,477 --> 00:11:02,116
Stop that nuke!

197
00:11:02,316 --> 00:11:04,004
Stop that nuke!

198
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:05,700
Stop that nuke!

199
00:11:05,962 --> 00:11:07,680
What's going on here?

200
00:11:10,592 --> 00:11:12,411
The military has to do this!

201
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:15,061
It's their only way to kill ManBearPig.

202
00:11:25,538 --> 00:11:29,367
Good, Butters. Now imagine
some more archers on the castle walls!

203
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:33,062
Aslan! We're losing the battle!

204
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:36,345
We managed to fight off the
vampires and werewolves, but...

205
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:39,610
now our troops are being
shot down by the Cavity Creeps.

206
00:11:40,052 --> 00:11:41,252
Cavity Creeps?

207
00:11:41,873 --> 00:11:43,454
We make holes in teeth!

208
00:11:43,654 --> 00:11:45,157
We make holes in teeth!

209
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,493
What can destroy the Cavity Creeps?

210
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:49,996
Only Crest Gel with Tartar Control.

211
00:11:50,257 --> 00:11:52,999
Quickly! You must imagine
a giant Crest Gel!

212
00:11:56,455 --> 00:11:57,455
Yes!

213
00:11:58,637 --> 00:12:02,487
His powers are getting stronger.
We might just have a chance here.

214
00:12:02,702 --> 00:12:04,427
<i>Aslan, we've captured a spy!</i>

215
00:12:04,688 --> 00:12:06,637
He was sneaking around
the Gumdrop Forest!

216
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:09,597
Stan! Hey look, I imagined Stan here!

217
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:13,394
No, no! I got sucked through Operation
Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.

218
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:15,919
Project Imagination Doorway?

219
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:21,151
Nevermind! The battle is almost won!
We can deal with him later.

220
00:12:21,413 --> 00:12:23,474
No, you don't understand.
There's a nuke.

221
00:12:23,654 --> 00:12:25,781
The government is about
to level this entire place.

222
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:27,198
What?

223
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,715
Why would they nuke Imaginationland?

224
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,912
So the terrorists can't
ever use it against us again.

225
00:12:32,173 --> 00:12:34,351
We can get Imaginationland
under control;

226
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:36,334
the Chosen One just needs more time!

227
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:40,066
- The Chosen One?
- Yeah, it turns out I'm the Key.

228
00:12:41,002 --> 00:12:43,214
<i>Missile launch sequence initiated.</i>

229
00:12:43,476 --> 00:12:46,385
All right, people,
I want this nuking done by the books.

230
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:48,511
- Sir, we have a security breach!
- What?!

231
00:12:48,631 --> 00:12:51,515
There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert,
it's coming from Sector 2!

232
00:12:51,776 --> 00:12:53,224
Sector 2?

233
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:01,359
What the hell do you think you're doing
declaring leprechauns aren't real?!

234
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,484
What?

235
00:13:02,746 --> 00:13:05,503
You just can't declare that
imaginary things aren't real!

236
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:07,027
Who are you to say what's real?!

237
00:13:07,147 --> 00:13:10,367
Think about it: is blue real?
Is love really real?

238
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:14,746
Imaginary things are things made up
by people, like Santa and Rudolph.

239
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:18,583
Yeah, and they detract from real things,
like Jesus.

240
00:13:18,845 --> 00:13:20,835
Maybe Jesus is imaginary too.

241
00:13:21,097 --> 00:13:23,923
Ooooh, you'd better not say that!
You'll go to hell!

242
00:13:24,184 --> 00:13:26,509
It's possible that
hell is also imaginary.

243
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:31,179
So then, we're about to nuke hell...
that's a good thing, right?

244
00:13:31,441 --> 00:13:33,724
Hell yeah, that's a good thing, yeah.

245
00:13:33,985 --> 00:13:36,811
What if heaven is imaginary?
We'd be nuking heaven.

246
00:13:37,072 --> 00:13:39,438
- Yeah, but it wouldn't be real.
- So it'd be all right.

247
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:42,025
Look, maybe they're
all part of the same thing.

248
00:13:42,225 --> 00:13:44,729
Santa and Jesus and
hell and- leprechauns.

249
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:47,154
Maybe they're all real
in the same way, right?

250
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:49,513
Santa Claus and leprechauns
are imaginary,

251
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:51,534
but Jesus and hell are real!

252
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:54,745
- Then, what about Buddha?
- Well of course he's imaginary!

253
00:13:55,006 --> 00:13:57,679
Awww, see?
Now you're being intolerant, Tom.

254
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,879
Am I real?

255
00:13:59,636 --> 00:14:00,652
All right, enough!

256
00:14:00,772 --> 00:14:03,629
Keep that kid out of the way and
let's get back to the nuking at hand!

257
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,132
No! Leprechauns are real, Goddamnit!

258
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:10,433
<i>Kyle?</i>

259
00:14:11,237 --> 00:14:13,909
- <i>Kyle, what happened?</i>
- Nothing.

260
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:15,687
- <i>What??</i>
- Nothing happened!

261
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:17,377
There's nothing I can do!

262
00:14:17,577 --> 00:14:20,353
<i>Dude, you can't let the
government fire off that nuke!</i>

263
00:14:20,553 --> 00:14:23,613
They say they can do whatever they want
because imaginary things aren't real!

264
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:26,326
<i>Well you have to convince
them they are real!</i>

265
00:14:26,526 --> 00:14:28,589
No way, dude,
then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls.

266
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:31,157
<i>Whatever it takes,
you have to do it, all right?!</i>

267
00:14:31,418 --> 00:14:33,576
<i>Hang on, Kyle,
Jesus wants to talk to you.</i>

268
00:14:33,925 --> 00:14:34,925
Huh?

269
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,069
- <i>Hello, Kyle? This is Jesus.</i>
- Oh boy...

270
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:41,218
<i>What seems to be the problem, my child?</i>

271
00:14:41,372 --> 00:14:42,779
Jesus, I can't do anything.

272
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:46,088
I'm just a fourth grader
going against the entire government.

273
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:49,675
Uh, hello? Jesus?

274
00:14:50,102 --> 00:14:53,580
<i>No eh, hey Kyle, this is Luke Skywalker.</i>

275
00:14:54,488 --> 00:14:56,809
<i>Look, I know this seems
like an impossible task,</i>

276
00:14:57,002 --> 00:14:59,257
<i>but do you remember when
I brought down the Death Star.</i>

277
00:14:59,377 --> 00:15:02,027
<i>I mean, that seemed
impossible too, right?</i>

278
00:15:02,285 --> 00:15:03,305
Yeah, I guess.

279
00:15:03,462 --> 00:15:07,712
<i>Okay, now hold on, because Superman
is here and he wants to say something.</i>

280
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:11,190
- <i>Kyle, this is Superman.</i>
- Hi, Superman.

281
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:13,979
<i>I know that saving people
can be a big responsibility,</i>

282
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,314
<i>but no matter what it takes,
it's worth it.</i>

283
00:15:16,504 --> 00:15:18,557
- I know.
- <i>You can do this, Kyle.</i>

284
00:15:18,757 --> 00:15:20,909
<i>Now hang on,
because Hercules wants to talk to you.</i>

285
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:23,094
- Oh God...
- <i>Yes, God is here too.</i>

286
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:26,344
<i>He's gonna talk to you
right after Captain Crunch.</i>

287
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,178
Popeye, I need some help here!

288
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:37,181
Popeye is being killed
by Christmas Critters.

289
00:15:41,644 --> 00:15:43,451
Hey, what is that?

290
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:48,024
More spinach for Popeye!

291
00:15:50,507 --> 00:15:52,654
Imagine an M60 for Jesus!

292
00:15:54,227 --> 00:15:55,227
All right!

293
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,914
The boy is doing it!
Everything is going to be okay!

294
00:16:00,987 --> 00:16:02,937
<i>Missile launch in one minute.</i>

295
00:16:03,565 --> 00:16:06,387
Goddamnit, you stupid assholes
are going to ruin everything!

296
00:16:06,587 --> 00:16:07,878
Prepare for launch...

297
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:10,013
- Sir, we have a security breach!
- What?!

298
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:13,008
There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert,
it's coming from Sector 2!

299
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:14,717
Sector 2?

300
00:16:17,982 --> 00:16:20,599
- Kyle?
- The hell are you doing back here?!

301
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,530
Listen, you don't have to do this!

302
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,728
Our imaginations aren't
running wild anymore.

303
00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:28,065
Why is it so easy for children
to break into the Pentagon?!

304
00:16:28,476 --> 00:16:29,733
You have to stop!

305
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:33,655
If I'm not mistaken, you're the one
who bet that leprechauns weren't real.

306
00:16:33,855 --> 00:16:35,573
So why do you care what happens?

307
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:37,084
Because I- I...

308
00:16:37,891 --> 00:16:38,891
Um...

309
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:41,161
Because I think... they are real.

310
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,980
It's all real.

311
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,436
Think about it.
Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus

312
00:16:46,636 --> 00:16:49,378
affected your lives more
than most real people in this room?

313
00:16:50,434 --> 00:16:52,782
I mean, whether Jesus
is real or not, he...

314
00:16:52,982 --> 00:16:55,421
he's had a bigger impact
on the world than any of us have.

315
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:59,471
And the same could be said of Bugs
Bunny and Superman and Harry Potter.

316
00:16:59,671 --> 00:17:03,349
They've changed my life,
changed the way I act on the Earth.

317
00:17:03,611 --> 00:17:05,811
Doesn't that make them kind of "real."

318
00:17:07,014 --> 00:17:10,742
They might be imaginary, but they're
more important than most of us here.

319
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:13,941
And they're all gonna be
around long after we're dead.

320
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:15,241
So in a way,

321
00:17:15,947 --> 00:17:18,697
those things are more
realer than any of us.

322
00:17:29,141 --> 00:17:31,044
Abort the sequence.

323
00:17:36,603 --> 00:17:39,095
So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh?

324
00:17:39,295 --> 00:17:42,030
Guess that means
I did win the bet after all.

325
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,833
And you know what that means, Kyle.

326
00:17:43,953 --> 00:17:46,950
Just let it go with your fucking balls
already, you fucking asshole!!

327
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,815
Your friends have been in danger and
all you care about it this stupid bet!

328
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,985
Well I've decided,
Cartman, even if we had a bet,

329
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,434
that I am never sucking your balls,
you got that?!

330
00:17:54,554 --> 00:17:57,157
They can throw me in jail for
the rest of my life, but I am never

331
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,865
going to suck your balls, never!
So there!

332
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:02,576
What happened?!
Why hasn't the missile gone off?!

333
00:18:02,837 --> 00:18:06,996
- There's been an abort, Mr. Gore.
- No! ManBearPig has to die!

334
00:18:07,258 --> 00:18:08,414
Oh Jesus, no!

335
00:18:23,758 --> 00:18:27,183
That's it, Aslan!
The evil characters have fled!

336
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:28,829
The day is ours!

337
00:18:34,974 --> 00:18:35,974
Kyle!

338
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,194
Fellas! Where'd you come from?

339
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,114
What is that?

340
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,910
Huh...

341
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:29,971
He did it!

342
00:19:31,234 --> 00:19:33,291
Oh look, I'm back!

343
00:19:33,937 --> 00:19:35,127
Nice going, kid.

344
00:19:37,932 --> 00:19:41,549
The evil characters!
They're all behind the wall again.

345
00:19:41,811 --> 00:19:46,288
- Dude! How did you do that, Butters?
- Well I just... used my imagination.

346
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:51,655
You know, I really have
learned a lot, you guys.

347
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,149
What Kyle said about
imaginary things being real and,

348
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:57,172
Butters using his imagination?
It makes me think that...

349
00:19:57,372 --> 00:20:00,822
well maybe we all have the
power to make things a reality.

350
00:20:03,564 --> 00:20:05,257
I why look, it's me.

351
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:06,668
And...

352
00:20:07,986 --> 00:20:09,383
And there's Kyle.

353
00:20:09,745 --> 00:20:11,695
And, what's Kyle about to do?

354
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:14,329
Cartman, don't!

355
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:17,672
O-hoo Kyle!
What are you doing to my balls?

356
00:20:17,872 --> 00:20:20,515
Oho, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls!

357
00:20:20,975 --> 00:20:22,590
- Dude.
- Oh my God.

358
00:20:22,852 --> 00:20:25,219
Oh Kyle, you are gobbling
those balls, aren't you?

359
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,541
I told you you would suck my balls
before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?

360
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:31,683
I'm not sucking your balls;
that's imaginary!

361
00:20:31,883 --> 00:20:34,937
No- Kyle, I believe you said
that imaginary things are real.

362
00:20:35,198 --> 00:20:36,688
That's true. You did.

363
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:38,322
Oh, look at you go, Kyle!

364
00:20:38,442 --> 00:20:40,859
Oho, you dirty girl!
You love those balls.

365
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:47,106
Okay, Kyle, that's enough ballsucking.
We need to get you boys home.

366
00:20:47,306 --> 00:20:49,146
I am not sucking Cartman's balls!

367
00:20:49,346 --> 00:20:52,119
Whatever you imagine to be real,
is real.

368
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,686
<i>Butters? Butters!</i>

369
00:20:57,886 --> 00:20:59,388
Huh? What?

370
00:20:59,588 --> 00:21:00,588
Oh!

371
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,257
Oh! It was all just a dream.

372
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:05,968
Come on, Butters, time to get up.

373
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:08,341
Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream!

374
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:12,349
I saved all of Imaginationland from
running wild after a terrorist attack!

375
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,935
You were in Imaginationland, Butters!
We've read all about it in the paper!

376
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,481
The question is,
what were you doing in Imaginationland

377
00:21:18,601 --> 00:21:21,316
when you were supposed to be helping
your mother clean up the basement?!

378
00:21:21,436 --> 00:21:23,026
You are grounded, mister!

379
00:21:26,265 --> 00:21:28,197
Wait, I'm not grounded.

380
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:30,572
- Oh yes, you are!
- Oh yeah?

381
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:37,100
That only works in Imaginationland!
You're grounded!

382
00:21:39,142 --> 00:21:40,206
Ah shit.

383
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,712
