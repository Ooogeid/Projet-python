Season 13 Episode 10
"W.T.F."

2
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,201
Say that again, Edge.
You think you're better than me?

3
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:40,123
Cena, your mouth has gotten you
into trouble for the last time.

4
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,749
I'm gonna shut it up for you!

5
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,546
- Mess him up, Edge!
- Kick his ass!

6
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,925
I've got something else
to tell you, Edge!

7
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,053
I slept with Vanessa last night!

8
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,767
Cena slept with Edge's girlfriend!

9
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:03,521
- {\*Oh }My God{\*, dude}. This is so awesome!
- I am having the best time!

10
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,691
You cheated
and took my belt from me.

11
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,734
And now
I can't hardly get work wrestling!

12
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,279
You took my girl
and you took my job!

13
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,533
He took his job!

14
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,451
He took his job!

15
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,583
Sweet!

16
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,635
- Dude, awesome!
- This is so awesome!

17
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,727
- Dude, that was so badass!
- Wrestling is awesome!

18
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,522
This is it{\*, you guys}.
We know what are calling in life is{\* now}.

19
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,732
Tomorrow we are signing up
for wrestling class!

20
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,526
- All right!
- Sweet!

21
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:56,366
The fuck is this?

22
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,536
Why did they have us
put on long underwear?

23
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,455
{\*Well, }I guess {\*in wrestling}we're supposed
to make your own outfit

24
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,957
and then wear it over this.

25
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,792
{\*Yeah, }That makes sense.

26
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,752
{\*All right. So }Did everyone settle on their {\*wrestling }names?

27
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,671
I did.
I'm the Rad Russian.

28
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,173
I come from Russia
to crush your puny capitalist head!

29
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,299
All right{\*, boys}!

30
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,510
Glad to see some new recruits{\*I'm really glad to see we have some new recruits}

31
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,595
interested
in the fine sport of wrestling.

32
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,180
- Cool!
- Let's do this!

33
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,099
{\*Now, }The first things we're gonna learn{\* today}

34
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,559
are the fundamental wrestling holds.

35
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,395
Let's get some volunteers.

36
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,564
{\*Why don't you }Come over here, young man.
What's your name?

37
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,357
- The Rad Russian.
- What?

38
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,150
You capitalist swine!
I crush you!

39
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,237
Just {\*go ahead and }get on your hands and knees.

40
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,906
Just down on the floor.

41
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,784
Hands and knees.

42
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,413
{\*All right. }And now how about you?
Your name is?

43
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,124
Triceratops!

44
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,419
All right.
Come on over here.

45
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,546
I'm gonna position you into the official
wrestling starting position.

46
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,592
Here we go...

47
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,302
The fuck is this?

48
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,429
Now just reach around him, here.

49
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,098
- Good.
- Dude! Dude!

50
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,600
The fuck are you doing?

51
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,519
Get back on the floor.
{\*I'm teaching you }It's the starting position of wrestling!

52
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,771
That's not wrestling{\*, dude}.
That's fucking gay!

53
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,356
Are you a child molester?{\*Yeah. What are you, a child molester?}

54
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,566
Where's {\*all }the cool costumes
and jumping off ropes{\* and stuff}?

55
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,069
Not this again!

56
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:19,156
Let me guess, you {\*just }went to that stupid
WWE show in Denver last night!

57
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,578
The WWE is not wrestling!

58
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,664
That's a bunch of fake bullcrap!
How stupid are you?

59
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,875
Real wrestling, boys, is this.

60
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,001
Well, this is fucking lame{\*, dude}.

61
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,337
Let's get {\*the hell }out of here{\*, guys}.

62
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,422
{\*Yeah, This guy }He probably wants
to take pictures of us naked.

63
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,343
I got half a mind to report...
Report you to the police, sir!

64
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,224
The Wrestling Takedown Federation
has several matches planned today.

65
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,518
{\*All right.}So here's how we'll do this{\*, guys}.

66
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:51,147
I'll come out to the ring first,
then Jimmy tells me he'll kick my ass.{\*I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass.}

67
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:54,317
I'll say you slept with my girlfriend,
and I'll do you a headslap.{\*Then I'm gonna say you slept with my girlfriend, and I'll charge you and do a headslap.}

68
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,444
- Sounds good.
- Butters comes in as the ref{\*Then Butters you come in as the ref}

69
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,154
{\*all }like, "{\*No, }The fight hasn't started{\* yet}!"

70
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,282
That's when Jimmy sneaks up
and hits me with the foldaway chair.{\*And that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with the foldaway chair.}

71
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,242
Okie-doke!

72
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,827
So is that when I tell you
your girlfriend is a whore?

73
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:09,082
Let's save it for after Stan headbutts
Butters for stopping the fight.{\*Let's save the girlfriend is a whore line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again.}

74
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,293
- Boy, wrestling sure is fun!
- All right. We ready to try this{\*, guys}?

75
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,545
{\*All right. }Let's start wrestling.

76
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,257
- I'm gonna kick your ass!
- You slept with my girl{\*friend}, Hammerclaw!

77
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,013
No, the fight hasn't started yet.
No! Bad!

78
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,223
He slept with my girl{\*friend}, referee!

79
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,518
In my country
we don't wait for a bell, mister...

80
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,063
Your girl{\*friend} is a whore.

81
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,440
- {\*Wait for it, }Wait for the whore line.
- {\*Oh, }Right. Sorry.

82
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,233
You're gonna get it{\* now}, Hammerclaw!

83
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,570
- We'll see about that!
- Now hold on!

84
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,196
I am stopping the fight!

85
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:45,535
What's going on?

86
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,120
Apparently that crippled kid

87
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,872
slept with
that Russian kid's girlfriend.

88
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,958
Geez.
They're so young!

89
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:56,838
I'll kill you, Triceratops.
You made fun of my crippled mother!

90
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:00,132
That's because your mother
betrayed my mother, Juggernaut!

91
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,636
You don't come to this country
and make fun of it!

92
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,890
And just what do you care
about your pitiful country?

93
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,975
I served my country.
I fought for two years in Vietnam!

94
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,397
That kid was in Nam?
Man, that's incredible.

95
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,024
Good for you
for serving your country!

96
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:19,569
Guys, check this out!

97
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,281
There's this little kid from the Congo
who was raised by panthers!

98
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,657
Are you serious?

99
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:29,120
Just admit it, Congo.
Admit {\*that }you lied about me to Irene!

100
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,789
I admit nothing.
Maybe Irene lied to you!

101
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,460
That kid in the hat
is having sex with two different girls?

102
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,503
No, that little kid from the Congo

103
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:41,424
lied about one of them to {\*try and }get the kid
in the hat in trouble with his wife.

104
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,050
They're married?

105
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,511
You will have to forfeit the fight,
Rad Russian!

106
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,763
You can't fight
until your test results come back!

107
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,475
I {\*might }have to wait for my hepatitis test,
but in the meantime,

108
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,102
I have brought my comrade
from Mexico to wrestle against you!

109
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,521
That Russian kid's got hepatitis?

110
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,814
<i>Here he comes now!</i>

111
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,150
<i>The cold blooded wrestler
from Mexico.</i>

112
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,943
<i>El Pollo Loco!</i>

113
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,283
What are you doing here,
El Pollo Loco?

114
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,333
Your girlfriend doesn't even like you,
Stan the Man.

115
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,625
She likes me!

116
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,752
You {\*have no idea}don't know
what you're saying, Juggernaut!

117
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,172
Irene loves me
and I'm gonna marry her!

118
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,423
If she wants {\*to be with }you,

119
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,383
how about
she tells all these people here?{\*how about you have her tell all these people here?}

120
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,678
<i>Here some comes now.
It's Bad Irene!</i>

121
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,603
Let me tell you something.

122
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,022
It's true I love Stan the Man
with all my heart.

123
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,150
- But I want to be with Juggernaut now.
- What?

124
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:42,944
No way!

125
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,696
What are you doing?
Stan the Man loves you!

126
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,114
Don't break his heart!

127
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,992
If you love Juggernaut, Irene,

128
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,370
then tell what you did two years ago.
How you killed his child!

129
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,956
It's true. I was pregnant
with your child and I aborted it.

130
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,210
Irene, no!
Why?

131
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:03,339
Do you know what it's like
to have an abortion at seven{\* years old}?

132
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,465
Do you?

133
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,844
I've had so many abortions.
I {\*just }got addicted to them.

134
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,055
Did you hear that?

135
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,765
Irene, you said you loved me!

136
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,768
I don't love you.
I love abortions, don't you understand?{\*I'm not in love with you. I'm in love with abortions, don't you understand?}

137
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,737
I'm telling you guys,
you got to see this.

138
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,157
These kids ain't more
than eight or nine years old

139
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,659
and they got more problems
than you can imagine.

140
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,995
There's this one kid,
he saw his father get murdered.

141
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,123
And yesterday he finds the killer

142
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,375
and it's this other kid
who's an ex-cop.

143
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,919
Needless to say,
he whooped his ass good.

144
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,754
And there's this little girl.

145
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,883
She's actually addicted
to getting abortions.

146
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,134
Got pregnant
by nearly every boy there.

147
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:50,594
You're shitting me.

148
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,263
No, we're telling you
these kids are fucking crazy.

149
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,891
You gotta check it out.

150
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,478
You can watch them
almost every afternoon.

151
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,855
It's some of the greatest wrestling
we ever seen.

152
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,064
It isn't real!

153
00:08:02,308 --> 00:08:04,817
Don't you people understand?
That stuff isn't real.

154
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:07,402
None of it!
How stupid are you?

155
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:11,335
What do you mean it ain't real?

156
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,761
It's all made up.
Fiction.

157
00:08:14,886 --> 00:08:18,104
Real wrestling is a serious
and respectable sport.

158
00:08:18,643 --> 00:08:21,542
Why can't you {\*people }understand
that kind of wrestling isn't real?

159
00:08:22,594 --> 00:08:23,594
Mister,

160
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:26,547
there's a little girl out there
who's had fourteen abortions

161
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,520
and she ain't even ten yet.

162
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:31,552
But I guess
that's just not real to you.

163
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,666
Son a bitch.

164
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,225
Look!
This is wrestling!

165
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,295
Mister, you better take your gay porn
and walk right outta this bar.

166
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,780
Holy crap{\*, dude}.
There's a huge turnout tonight!

167
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,166
Good thing we made
those changes to the seating.

168
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,700
{\*All right. }You guys, let's bring it in.

169
00:08:55,024 --> 00:08:57,495
{\*I think }We've{\* really} done a great job.
Let's just keep the energy up,

170
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,163
have a good flow and have fun{\* out there}.

171
00:09:00,364 --> 00:09:02,387
Let's do this!
One, two...

172
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:03,962
Backyard wrestling!

173
00:09:12,932 --> 00:09:14,685
What a perfect night for fighting!

174
00:09:14,938 --> 00:09:17,401
Low, the moon sets
upon the tips of the trees and I,

175
00:09:17,526 --> 00:09:19,384
the man known as the Rad Russian,

176
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:21,800
start to stir
with the excitement of violence.

177
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:25,314
Only a country like yours
can breed men of such discontent{\*, Rad Russian}!

178
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:29,094
But you don't know what real pain is.
Pain, like I've known.

179
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:31,489
Abandoned when I was
four years old by my parents.

180
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:33,947
Left to die in a cold
and dark sewage tunnel.

181
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,313
Geez, I didn't know
his parents did that.

182
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,344
{\pub}I'm very sorry,
but I'm afraid we have to terminate

183
00:09:43,469 --> 00:09:46,054
your employment here
at South Park Elementary.

184
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,087
You're firing me?
Why?

185
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,798
The school board has decided
to discontinue the wrestling program.

186
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:56,061
Wrestling simply involves
too much adult subject matter.

187
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:58,180
Like murder and abortion.

188
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,432
No!
This isn't wrestling!

189
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,643
This isn't wrestling!

190
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,605
Principal Victoria,
{\*just }let me stay on and I can teach kids

191
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,257
what real wrestling is!

192
00:10:07,382 --> 00:10:09,149
{\*I'm sorry. }The board has made up their minds.

193
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:11,610
You can't fire me
for what these kids do!

194
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,820
That isn't the only reason{\* you're being let go}.

195
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,322
What{\* do you mean}?

196
00:10:16,237 --> 00:10:19,785
We found all the gay porn
on your iPhone, Mr. Conners.

197
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,139
So {\*I'm thinking }we do the part
about Jimmy's relationship

198
00:10:23,264 --> 00:10:25,967
with his alcoholic father
after you smash Butters onto the table.

199
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,899
- Sure, that works.
- You guys!

200
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:29,767
Listen to this.
It's amazing!

201
00:10:29,892 --> 00:10:33,181
- What, dude?
- We {\*just }received a letter from the WWE.

202
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,266
- From the {\*professional }wrestlers we saw in Denver?
- No way!

203
00:10:36,614 --> 00:10:39,239
"Gentlemen, we have heard
of your wrestling organization

204
00:10:39,364 --> 00:10:41,453
"and are quite interested
in its popularity.

205
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:43,764
"The WWE is delighted to inform you

206
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:47,271
"that it will be sending a talent scout,
president Vince McMahon,

207
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,274
"to view your wrestling event
this Saturday, the 24th."

208
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,240
Vince McMahon is coming to see us?

209
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:54,831
This is our shot
at making it into the WWE,

210
00:10:54,956 --> 00:10:56,154
to be real wrestlers!

211
00:10:56,771 --> 00:10:58,571
- My God!
- My God!

212
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,602
Guys, listen!

213
00:11:06,727 --> 00:11:08,584
We seriously have to focus here.

214
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,281
We've exactly three days
before the scout{\* is here to} see us wrestle.

215
00:11:11,406 --> 00:11:13,785
We've got to step it up
and work it like never before!

216
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,114
{\*It's }Time for{\*to start} the second act.
Let's bring the crowd back

217
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:18,552
from intermission
and then improvise some stuff{\* for Saturday}!

218
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:22,968
No, I think Congo
is a great wrestler.

219
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:25,289
I just think Rad Russian
has his number.

220
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,009
But Rad Russian
has a lot of abandonment issues.

221
00:11:30,813 --> 00:11:33,681
Looks like intermission is over.
We better head back.

222
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:40,532
I left my wife today.

223
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,044
Walked out of the apartment
without saying a word.

224
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,476
I ran away from my responsibilities,

225
00:11:46,601 --> 00:11:47,873
just I like always do.

226
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:51,446
And I, again,

227
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
am alone.

228
00:11:53,622 --> 00:11:55,831
Here he is.
Hiding in the forest as I told you!

229
00:11:55,956 --> 00:11:59,044
Juggernaut, there's to be
an ultimate Smackdown this Saturday.

230
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:01,362
Are you going
to run from that as well?

231
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,096
I'll fight anytime, anywhere!

232
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:06,266
He don't run from fights,
just from responsibilities.

233
00:12:13,177 --> 00:12:16,066
What do I do?
Juggernaut is my long lost brother,

234
00:12:16,191 --> 00:12:18,218
and yet Congo saved my life in Nam!

235
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,429
<i>It's El Pollo Loco!</i>

236
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:29,957
Thanks for coming{\*, guys}.

237
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,501
I'm sure you're wondering
why I've called you to Sizzler.

238
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,421
What's this about?
We should be writing our monologues.{\*We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.}

239
00:12:35,868 --> 00:12:37,618
{\*Well guys,}Kenny and I have been talking.

240
00:12:38,752 --> 00:12:42,756
{\*And I mean, }Smackdown might be our one shot
at making it into the WWE, right?

241
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,638
{\*A shot like this}And it might never come again.

242
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,350
The way we see it,
we have three primary obstacles

243
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:50,227
in making Smackdown a great show.

244
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,481
What{\* are you talking about}?

245
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,817
{\*Guys, }Let's face it.
They can't wrestle for crap.

246
00:12:57,126 --> 00:13:00,320
Every time,{\* I wrestle with one of them} they flub a line
or blow their monologue.

247
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,757
And Token,
he has no emotion, no timing.

248
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,742
He's the worst wrestler
I've ever seen.

249
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,932
- He's right.
- What?

250
00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:10,330
It's {\*really }hard to do your best wrestling
{\*when you're up }against Token.

251
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:12,272
- Right?
- Butters and Jimmy,

252
00:13:12,397 --> 00:13:15,044
{\*They're okay, but }they're never gonna make it
as professional wrestlers.

253
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,713
So then WWE will recruit us
and not them.

254
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,602
{\*No dude, }They're gonna hurt our chances!

255
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:22,242
Because {\* we all know that}the new material

256
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:25,095
I've written is stuff{\* those guys} they can't handle,
{\*and }we'll suffer from it.

257
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,222
So what{\* do we do}?

258
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,205
We gotta bring somebody else on
who can handle the more difficult roles{\* that we wrestle against instead of those guys}.

259
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,749
Somebody who can do the harder stuff{\* we've written}
so that Token, Butters and Jimmy

260
00:13:35,874 --> 00:13:38,817
- can have smaller parts.
- How do we find this person{\* somebody wrestle that well}?

261
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:41,403
It's simple.
We just gotta hold tryouts.

262
00:13:47,574 --> 00:13:49,574
Number 17, step forward please.

263
00:13:51,937 --> 00:13:54,866
You're wrestling a Muslim immigrant.
You suspect he could be a terrorist

264
00:13:54,991 --> 00:13:57,294
and your parents died
in the 9/11 attacks. Go.

265
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,339
You dirty, Muslim bastard!

266
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:02,782
I don't trust you.
And I never will!

267
00:14:02,907 --> 00:14:04,819
Do you know how it feels
to lose your parents.

268
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:08,525
No, you wouldn't, you smelly brown
middle eastern piece of...

269
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,299
Thank you.
Number 24.

270
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,522
You're wrestling for the right
to marry Mackenzie Phillips

271
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:16,980
but just learned that she had sex
with her father. Go.

272
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,304
Your father?

273
00:14:19,623 --> 00:14:20,923
Your own father?

274
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:25,030
I don't care if you were on drugs,
you sick whore!

275
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:26,289
Thank you.

276
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,062
- That guy's a pretty good wrestler.
- Yeah, not bad.

277
00:14:30,187 --> 00:14:32,329
{\*Let's see.}Can we get number 37
to step forward again?

278
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:35,374
{\*Just }Want to get to know you {\*all a little }better.
What can you tell us about you{\*rself}?

279
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:39,123
Not a whole lot to tell, really.
Was born in Fort Collins.

280
00:14:39,248 --> 00:14:41,589
Started watching wrestling
when I was four years old.

281
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,111
My father, he liked it too...

282
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:45,717
until he died.

283
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:48,720
Sometimes I think it's because of him
I follow this dream.

<i>breaking arms.</i>

291
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:12,031
- Damn{\*, dude}, that is some badass wrestling.
- Yeah, this guy crushes.

292
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,432
It isn't fair.

293
00:15:23,207 --> 00:15:24,339

Wait a minute.
Who is that?

do not abort this baby.

They are decent wrestlers.

00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:21,039
We'll see how they develop
their through line in the second act.

329
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,175
I thought I would find you here,
Triceratops!

330
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,826
Stay out of my business,
Sgt. Hammerclaw!

331
00:17:27,685 --> 00:17:28,685
Excuse me.

332
00:17:29,069 --> 00:17:31,121
I'm sorry,
I'm afraid this area is off limits.

333
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:34,094
Don't mind me.
I was just about to...

334
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:41,067
What the fuck is this?

335
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:48,571
How I long
for the spring meadows of Russia.

336
00:17:48,924 --> 00:17:50,543
The soft Russian sky.

337
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,439
When are you going
to face reality, Congo?

338
00:17:54,564 --> 00:17:57,411
Just because you were raised
by panthers doesn't mean you are one!

339
00:17:57,536 --> 00:18:00,040
He's closer to a panther
than you'll ever be!

340
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:02,247
Lies!
These are all a bunch of lies!

341
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:04,830
Now, you listen here, El Pollo Loco.

342
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:08,420
Your wife was killed,
but you can't keep Irene's aborted baby.{\*It doesn't matter if you wife was killed. You cannot keep Irene's aborted baby.}

343
00:18:10,431 --> 00:18:13,205
Just let him crawl back Mexico,
Sgt. Hammerclaw.

344
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,928
Only one shot.

345
00:18:15,486 --> 00:18:16,701
Maximum damage.

346
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:19,914
This is all your fault,
you WWE president asshole.

347
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,348
Your fault we all die here
right now.

348
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:25,846
For wrestling!

349
00:18:54,411 --> 00:18:55,411
Shut up!

350
00:18:56,573 --> 00:18:58,344
You idiots want wrestling?

351
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,102
This is wrestling.

352
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,978
We want some real wrestlers.

353
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,100
This is just a bunch of garbage.

354
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:11,733
And you're all ruining
the good name of wrestling.

355
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,562
Wrestling is from ancient Greece.

356
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,030
It's in the Olympics.

357
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:20,180
What the hell do you care?
Get off the wrestling mat.

358
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,519
Why do I care?

359
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:25,794
These kids made it so real,
wrestling is gone from schools.

360
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,858
It's practically gone
from the culture.

361
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:29,542
Damn it.
They took my job!

362
00:19:31,056 --> 00:19:32,056
What?

363
00:19:33,225 --> 00:19:35,096
- They took his job.
- I know.

364
00:19:36,631 --> 00:19:38,440
You want to know pain?

365
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:41,989
Pain is dedicating
your entire life to a sport,

366
00:19:42,253 --> 00:19:43,509
to a career,

367
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:45,560
and then having it all
ripped away from you

368
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,654
like a baby from its mother.

369
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,607
- Man, they took his job.
- They took his job.

370
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,104
Lost everything.

371
00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:57,654
Couldn't even afford to pay
for my little retriever Rex anymore.

372
00:19:58,283 --> 00:20:00,449
Animal control came and got him.

373
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:03,743
They took his dog!

374
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,881
I ended up on the streets stealing.

375
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:14,254
Got busted by the police
and had to spend the night in jail.

376
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:18,258
The other inmates, they beat me up
and fractured my jaw so I couldn't eat.

377
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,114
They broke his jaw!

378
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:22,637
They broke his jaw!

379
00:20:27,617 --> 00:20:29,478
So you see, I have nothing left.

380
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,603
Nothing!

381
00:20:30,914 --> 00:20:32,626
Not even the will to live.

382
00:20:48,835 --> 00:20:52,602
Sir, that was one
of the finest wrestling performances

383
00:20:52,727 --> 00:20:54,811
- I have ever seen.
- What?

384
00:20:54,936 --> 00:20:57,481
Will you not join
our wrestling organization?

385
00:20:57,606 --> 00:20:59,945
I promise to make you
our leading act.

386
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,777
- You mean it?
- Come.

387
00:21:01,902 --> 00:21:04,012
I want to get you in rehearsals
right away.

388
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,513
What?

389
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,177
What about us?
Our show?

390
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:10,978
Sorry, boys.
You are decent wrestlers,

391
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,065
but lack the raw wrestling talent
this man has.

392
00:21:15,982 --> 00:21:18,276
This is your fault, Kyle.
You screwed up the second act.

393
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:20,445
Me?
It was your stupid ass writing.

394
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,905
Face it, Stan's crappy singing
is what who sunk us.

395
00:21:30,732 --> 00:21:31,998
What the hell is this?

396
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,710
This is garbage fight.

397
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:37,900
Screw this.
This is just stupid.

398
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,460
Fake!

399
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,429
