South Park - Season 12 Episode 1
"Tonsil Trouble"

2
00:00:38,553 --> 00:00:42,697
Well, there's no doubt about it.
Those tonsils need to come out.

3
00:00:42,817 --> 00:00:45,744
- What?
- What exactly does that entail, doctor?

4
00:00:45,864 --> 00:00:48,910
It's a very simple operation.
We'll just put you to sleep, Eric,

5
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,066
and when you wake
up you'll be tonsil-free.

6
00:00:51,186 --> 00:00:54,437
Nuh, no way.
I'm not going to the hospital, mom!

7
00:00:54,557 --> 00:00:56,972
Oh, I thought you were a tough kid.

8
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:59,597
You're not scared of hospitals, are you?

9
00:00:59,717 --> 00:01:01,466
No, I'm not scared.

10
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:04,397
I just... I don't want
my tonsils out, that's all.

11
00:01:04,517 --> 00:01:07,395
Well then, I guess you
don't want all the "ice cream"

12
00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:10,154
you get after the surgery either.

13
00:01:10,274 --> 00:01:11,392
Ice cream?

14
00:01:11,512 --> 00:01:14,105
Be a shame to have
to give all that free ice cream

15
00:01:14,225 --> 00:01:17,131
to the big boys who aren't
scared of the hospitals.

16
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:20,665
Whattaya say, champ?
Think you can tough it out?

17
00:01:20,785 --> 00:01:24,485
Well, you did say free ice cream?

18
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:30,794


19
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:35,256
Poopsiekins, wake up. Wake up, honey.

20
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,019
It... it's over?

21
00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:41,404
That's right. You did it, poopsiekins.

22
00:01:41,524 --> 00:01:45,267
It's over! I didn't feel anything.
You were right, mom!

23
00:01:45,387 --> 00:01:47,221
I'm so proud of you, Eric.

24
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,396
All right, so where's my ice cream?

25
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:51,906
Oh! Here's the doctor now.

26
00:01:52,026 --> 00:01:54,665
- Hi, doctor.
- You were right, doctor.

27
00:01:54,785 --> 00:01:56,778
Everything is okay.

28
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,418
No, it's not.
Eric, I'm afraid that we've

29
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:03,785
accidentally infected
you with the AIDS virus.

30
00:02:06,048 --> 00:02:08,257
- What?
- What's that supposed to mean?

31
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:11,431
During the tonsil surgery we had
to supply you with donor blood, a...

32
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:15,357
mistake was made and you were
given blood contaminated with HIV.

33
00:02:15,477 --> 00:02:17,799
It was a one in a billion fluke.

34
00:02:18,328 --> 00:02:19,783
I have AIDS?

35
00:02:19,903 --> 00:02:23,853
Not yet, but we've confirmed that
you now have the virus that causes AIDS.

36
00:02:23,973 --> 00:02:26,423
We are very sorry.

37
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:29,571
Sorry? You gave me
AIDS and you're sorry?

38
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,665
Oh, my poor little baby.

39
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,683
Mom, you said nothing would go wrong!

40
00:02:33,803 --> 00:02:36,031
Oh God! Oh no!

41
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:39,696
No. No, this is a joke, right?
This is a joke! I can't have AIDS!

42
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:43,338
We're going to do everything in
our power to make this up to you, Eric.

43
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:47,208
For starters,
I think I owe you some ice cream.

44
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,958
Fuck your ice cream,
you said I'd be fine!

45
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:55,638
You all said I'd be fine!

46
00:02:56,972 --> 00:03:00,358
My baby has HIV!

47
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,136
No! No!

48
00:03:03,396 --> 00:03:05,889


49
00:03:07,157 --> 00:03:08,896
Thank you for coming, everyone.

50
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:10,852
Boys, please take a seat.

51
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,350
What's going on? Are we in trouble?

52
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,420
Boys, the reason we
called you all in is because

53
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,690
one of your friends
has a serious illness.

54
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:24,666
Eric Cartman has
been diagnosed with HIV.

55
00:03:26,805 --> 00:03:28,369
- What?
- Oh no...

56
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:31,884
He's been to several specialists
since a botched blood transfusion.

57
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:35,003
The disease is in the very early
stages and completely manageable.

58
00:03:35,123 --> 00:03:37,337
But he's naturally a bit scared.

59
00:03:38,388 --> 00:03:39,923
Cartman has HIV?

60
00:03:40,183 --> 00:03:43,663
We need everyone to understand
that you can't get the virus from Eric.

61
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:46,145
You can still give
him hugs and even kisses.

62
00:03:46,265 --> 00:03:48,818
- Don't be afraid of him, just-
- Excuse me.

63
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:51,088
Eric Cartman has HIV?

64
00:03:52,123 --> 00:03:54,355
Alright, we're gonna bring Eric in now,

65
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:59,459
and let's all be as supportive as
we can and show him lots of love Okay?

66
00:04:00,577 --> 00:04:04,113
Eric? Come on in, your friends
all want to say hi, m'kay?

67
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,900
- Hi, Eric.
- Hi there, Eric.

68
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:11,246
No. Way.

69
00:04:11,686 --> 00:04:16,126
How are you doing, Eric? You know,
I think you're a real special little guy.

70
00:04:16,246 --> 00:04:21,246
And even though you have AIDS, I ain't
gonna act any different towards you.

71
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:25,635
God damnit this sucks ass!

72
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:29,674
Excuse me,
I have to step out for a minute.

73
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:44,681
Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard.

74
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:49,008
Is Kyle laughing out there? This isn't
the time for funny jokes! I'm gonna die!

75
00:04:49,128 --> 00:04:50,865
No you're not going to die, Eric.

76
00:04:50,985 --> 00:04:54,255
AIDS isn't a big a deal as it used to be,
there are advances in treatment and-

77
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,880
Not a big deal?
Is that all everyone feels?

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,420
People need to understand
the seriousness of this illness!

79
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,839
And the bravery of the
people who struggle with it!

80
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:06,146


81
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:09,296
We are here tonight to salute
the bravery and the courage

82
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:12,932
of one very special little
boy who is living with HIV.

83
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:16,644
Where the hell is everybody?

84
00:05:17,554 --> 00:05:18,954
Excuse me, shouldn't we wait

85
00:05:19,074 --> 00:05:21,236
for everyone to arrive
before we get started?

86
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:24,319
This is everyone.
We didn't sell that many tickets.

87
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:25,957
Great benefit, Eric!

88
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:28,656
The Italian meatballs are fa-fantastic.

89
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,182
So this is it?

90
00:05:30,302 --> 00:05:33,445
I'm afraid AIDS benefits aren't
as popular as they used to be.

91
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:37,602
AIDS was more the '80s/'90s disease.
It's all about cancer now.

92
00:05:37,722 --> 00:05:38,930
Well that's just great!

93
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,503
Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it
right when everyone stops giving a crap!

94
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:47,803
With all of your help, we have raised
over seventeen dollars for AIDS tonight,

95
00:05:47,923 --> 00:05:51,679
and that money will certainly
go towards helping little Eric Markman.

96
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,849
Just bring out Elton John already!

97
00:05:55,704 --> 00:05:57,713
Uh we're sorry, Elton couldn't make it.

98
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,520
He had to play at a cancer benefit.

99
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,631
It's all right, we got
somebody better: Jimmy Buffett!

100
00:06:04,215 --> 00:06:05,446
Jimmy Buffett?

101
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:06,841
Hello everyone.

102
00:06:06,961 --> 00:06:10,570
I wrote this song for
a very brave little boy.

103
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,712
AIDSburger in paradise!

104
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,913
AIDSburger and it ain't nice!

105
00:06:17,173 --> 00:06:19,313
Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett
except for frat boys

106
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:21,613
and alcoholic chicks from the South!

107
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:26,344
A little boy in South Park
Dying of AIDS in the cold dark

108
00:06:26,464 --> 00:06:29,884
How he got AIDS I haven't a clue

109
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:33,696
Wasting away again
because of AIDS and stuff

110
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:35,932
How are we all feeling tonight?

111
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:38,726
Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett!
You fucking suck!

112
00:06:38,986 --> 00:06:41,091
Oh poopsiekins, be nice.

113
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:44,065
Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS!

114
00:06:48,502 --> 00:06:52,702
Hey guys, thanks a lot for coming
to my AIDS benefit yesterday.

115
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,585
Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot.

116
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:58,290
Yeah, you forgot. Just like
a lot of people lately have forgot

117
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,937
that AIDS is still killing people!

118
00:07:00,057 --> 00:07:04,867
Seems like all of America has
forgot that HIV is a serious disease.

119
00:07:04,987 --> 00:07:07,540
Well, did...
Elton John sing a song for you?

120
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,460
...No, as a matter of fact,
Jimmy Buffett came instead.

121
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:15,409
Oh yeah, it's real fucking funny, Kyle!

122
00:07:16,272 --> 00:07:19,063
I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really.

123
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:21,903
Cartman, I feel really
bad for you. Honestly.

124
00:07:22,023 --> 00:07:23,596
- No you don't!
- I do.

125
00:07:23,716 --> 00:07:27,516
If you really felt bad, you'd
wipe that fucking smirk off your face!

126
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:29,798
Well any Goddamned second, Kyle!

127
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:31,612
I'm sorry. I gotta go home.

128
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:37,379
Jesus Christ,
can you believe that asshole?

129
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,557
He does feel bad for you, Cartman.
He just thinks it's... ironic.

130
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:41,845
Ironic how?

131
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:43,624
You know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and...

132
00:07:43,884 --> 00:07:46,185
Oh, and what?
I deserve it? Is that what you think?

133
00:07:46,305 --> 00:07:48,369
Not me! That's eh, kinda what he thinks.

134
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:51,754
Nobody deserves this illness,
Stan, Kenny! Nobody!

135
00:07:51,874 --> 00:07:54,652
It's awful! And maybe
somebody needs to teach Kyle

136
00:07:54,772 --> 00:07:56,846
how to have some compassion!

137
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:10,195
Oh, okay, it's clear.

138
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:13,529
All right,
get that rope ready to hoist me up.

139
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:17,683
- Okay, but... what are you going to do?
- Kyle thinks that HIV is funny,

140
00:08:17,803 --> 00:08:19,256
so we're gonna make him look funny,

141
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:21,618
and then he'll know how
it feels to be laughed at.

142
00:08:21,738 --> 00:08:25,374
I just... I don't know if I should
be helping you make Kyle look silly.

143
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:27,054
Butters,

144
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,529
helping people who have AIDS is one
of the most important things you can do.

145
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:33,960
I know, but are you sure
Kyle has to be taught a lesson?

146
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,680
I'm not just sure, Butters.
I'm HIV-positive.

147
00:08:38,147 --> 00:08:40,181
Oh yeah, well I guess that's true.

148
00:08:40,674 --> 00:08:42,803
All right, now get the rope up over
that third rafter above the window.

149
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:45,592
- That's the easiest access.
- You really know what you're doing.

150
00:08:45,712 --> 00:08:49,262
Yeah, I've sneaked into
Kyle's room lots of times.

151
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,843
You think HIV is something
to be laughed at, Kyle?

152
00:09:03,963 --> 00:09:05,313
Well...

153
00:09:06,223 --> 00:09:09,473
Let's just see how
funny it is now, asshole.

154
00:09:26,877 --> 00:09:29,164
There there, bubbe, you'll be okay.

155
00:09:29,284 --> 00:09:32,995
Oh doctor, did you find anything?
Is it strep?

156
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:35,111
No, it isn't strep...

157
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,792
Oh, well there's a relief.

158
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:41,817
...Mrs. Broflovski, has your
son ever had a blood transfusion?

159
00:09:41,937 --> 00:09:43,578
No, why?

160
00:09:43,838 --> 00:09:47,522
Little boy, have you been
having unprotected anal sex?

161
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:50,730
- What? No?
- Doctor, what are you saying?

162
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,566
We've run every test imaginable...

163
00:09:53,686 --> 00:09:56,686
little Kyle here is infected with HIV.

164
00:09:57,488 --> 00:09:59,360
- What?
- HIV?

165
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,107
It took us a long time to narrow
it down, but there is no doubt.

166
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,684
No, that's impossible!

167
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:07,379
Little boy, are you sure you haven't taken
it up the hoohoo just once or twice?

168
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:09,606
No! No Goddamnit no!

169
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:12,012
I'm telling you you're wrong!
There, there's no way I can have HIV!

170
00:10:12,132 --> 00:10:16,444
Unless maybe...
Oh my God. That son of a bitch!

171
00:10:18,012 --> 00:10:19,712
Kyle? Kyle!

172
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:22,909
Pass me the ball!

173
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:27,188
Pass me the ball,
Craig, you stupid asshole!

174
00:10:29,436 --> 00:10:32,109
- Kyle, what the F?
- I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!

175
00:10:32,229 --> 00:10:34,233
- Kyle, what?
- What did he do?

176
00:10:34,353 --> 00:10:36,903
Why do I have HIV?

177
00:10:38,377 --> 00:10:42,238
Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle?
Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?

178
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:43,888
- What did you do?
- Nothing!

179
00:10:44,148 --> 00:10:47,385
Then why did Butters say he helped you
sneak into my room last Friday night?

180
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:49,356
Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale.

181
00:10:49,476 --> 00:10:51,771
Tattle-tale? Do you know
how serious this is?

182
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,343
Well, Kyle, maybe
I was just trying to prove a p-

183
00:10:55,463 --> 00:10:56,713
Kyle!

184
00:10:57,661 --> 00:10:59,695
Here you go! Here you go!

185
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:01,886
Hey! Hey, that's enough!

186
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:03,368
Break it up, m'kay?

187
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:06,215
Break it up! Hm'kay? M'kay!

188
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,834
All right, boys,
now what is this fighting all about?

189
00:11:14,245 --> 00:11:16,170
He gave me AIDS!

190
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:17,675
What?

191
00:11:17,795 --> 00:11:20,198
He purposely infected
me with his HIV virus!

192
00:11:20,318 --> 00:11:22,760
Is that true, Eric?
Did you give Kyle AIDS?

193
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,519
Well he was being a total dick!

194
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,713
And he's a big tattle-tale and going
around and talking crap about me!

195
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:30,476
Did you infect Kyle with the HIV virus,
yes or no?

196
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:33,604
Kind of.

197
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:36,633
Eric, that is not
appropriate behavior, m'kay?

198
00:11:36,753 --> 00:11:39,782
You cannot purposely infect
other kids with your disease!

199
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:43,155
That's right.
I think you owe Kyle an apology.

200
00:11:43,814 --> 00:11:46,046
- I'm sorry.
- An apology?

201
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,142
You're sorry for what, Eric?

202
00:11:48,262 --> 00:11:50,559
I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle.

203
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,716
That's better.

204
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,209
And now Kyle, maybe you should also
admit you were wrong for tattling.

205
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:57,925
...What?

206
00:11:58,045 --> 00:12:01,021
Kyle, the thing about tattling is,
tattling's bad.

207
00:12:01,141 --> 00:12:03,597
M'kay, because nobody
likes a tattle-tale, m'kay?

208
00:12:03,717 --> 00:12:06,447
A tattle-tale? He infected me with AIDS!

209
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:09,348
See? He's tattling again.
He hasn't learned a thing you guys.

210
00:12:13,038 --> 00:12:16,964
Well Kyle, I guess we're even now.
Shall we just call it a truce?

211
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:20,084
Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now?

212
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,960
Kyle, where are you going?

213
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:27,453
I'm going to break
everything that you own!

214
00:12:29,226 --> 00:12:31,713
What's that supposed to mean? Kyle?

215
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,498
Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!

216
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:39,086
Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole!

217
00:12:47,152 --> 00:12:48,999
What the fuck are you doing?

218
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:50,969
Kyle, stop it!

219
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,267
Goddamnit, don't!

220
00:12:55,597 --> 00:12:59,012
Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog!
Leave Clyde Frog alone!

221
00:12:59,132 --> 00:13:00,161
No!

222
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:02,281
Ah! Clyde Frog!

223
00:13:02,511 --> 00:13:04,805
Clyde Frobudjano no! Not the Xbox, Kyle!

224
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:07,425
Not the X-wait! Wait a second!

225
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,882
I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?

226
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:12,294
Just give me a chance,
and I can cure you!

227
00:13:12,414 --> 00:13:14,190
There is no cure, you asshole!

228
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,822
No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on
to something. There really is hope.

229
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:19,185
What hope?

230
00:13:19,305 --> 00:13:21,128
Break my Xbox and you'll never know.

231
00:13:21,505 --> 00:13:22,505
You're lying!

232
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:25,010
No! No, all right Kyle!
Magic Johnson, Kyle!

233
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,806
- The key is Magic Johnson.
- Magic Johnson?

234
00:13:27,926 --> 00:13:30,054
- He was a basketball player.
- So what?

235
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:34,664
So he got HIV like fifty years ago,
and he's still totally fine!

236
00:13:34,865 --> 00:13:37,159
Magic Johnson has some kind
of resistance to the virus, Kyle.

237
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,453
I've been researching
it since I got infected.

238
00:13:39,573 --> 00:13:42,217
If we can track him down and
and isolate his genetic prototype,

239
00:13:42,337 --> 00:13:44,378
we have a chance of
beating this thing, buddy.

240
00:13:44,498 --> 00:13:48,798
You and me, Kyle. We can overcome
our illness, I swear it to you!

241
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:52,997
You better! Because if
you don't find a cure for HIV,

242
00:13:53,117 --> 00:13:55,267
I will break your Xbox!

243
00:13:57,034 --> 00:13:58,582
My God...

244
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:01,492


245
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,761
We need two tickets to
Los Angeles as soon as possible.

246
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:09,246
Los Angeles.
Okay, I have a two o'clock flight.

247
00:14:09,366 --> 00:14:12,096
That would beee... $400 each.

248
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:16,179
Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have
to see Magic Johnson right away.

249
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:18,649
You see, we have AIDS.

250
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,741
...AIDS?

251
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:24,702
Wow, that's really... retro.

252
00:14:26,326 --> 00:14:29,447
But I'm sorry. I just
can't give away free seats.

253
00:14:29,707 --> 00:14:31,834
Don't you get it? We are two pals

254
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:35,235
afllicted with an illness, and who only
have each other in a race against time!

255
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:38,843
Innocent playful children who are stricken
with a dieadly disease for no reason!

256
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:42,228
Oh please, no reason!
I got AIDS from him!

257
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:45,754
Oh, you boys are like that, huh?

258
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:47,603
No!

259
00:14:47,723 --> 00:14:50,610
Are you sure you boys
just don't have any cash?

260
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,637
We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.

261
00:14:53,897 --> 00:14:58,347
Ugh, we sometimes offer free
seats to cancer patients, but AIDS I d-

262
00:14:58,467 --> 00:15:01,979
Hey Mitch? Do we have
any AIDS patient policies?

263
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:06,317
Forget it, alright? We'll use
another airline! One that cares!

264
00:15:08,453 --> 00:15:11,655
We're so happy to help
accommodate you brave boys.

265
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:13,925
What kind of cancer
did you say you have again?

266
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:16,134
Oh, you know, all over cancer.

267
00:15:16,254 --> 00:15:17,734
I'm so sorry.

268
00:15:17,854 --> 00:15:20,227
Yeah, well, at least
it's not as bad as having AIDS.

269
00:15:20,347 --> 00:15:22,013
AIDS is the worst disease.

270
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:25,638
Hm, I don't know. These days I think
I'd rather have AIDS than cancer.

271
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,765
No you wouldn't!

272
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:30,591
Look, shouldn't you be serving people
drinks or something? Get outta here!

273
00:15:30,851 --> 00:15:34,140
We're on our way, buddy.
Magic Johnson, here we come.

274
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,260
Don't. Touch me.

275
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:39,816
I know. I'm scared too.

276
00:15:45,538 --> 00:15:48,567
Magic. Magic, could you
come to the front for a minute?

277
00:15:48,932 --> 00:15:50,899
There are a couple
of boys here to see you.

278
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:53,296
Two brave little buddies
who against all odds

279
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,027
have journeyed across America
to find the cure for AIDS.

280
00:15:56,147 --> 00:16:00,197
All they have are each
other in a race against time.

281
00:16:02,554 --> 00:16:04,227
Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson.

282
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:05,375
We were hoping...

283
00:16:05,495 --> 00:16:08,212
that maybe you have some kind of key
that can help us with our disease.

284
00:16:09,477 --> 00:16:12,313
You boys both have the virus?
Are you sure?

285
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:16,057
We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.

286
00:16:16,177 --> 00:16:18,073
Will you stop it with that?

287
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:20,651
What part of this is funny to you?

288
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,904
Kyle, we need to find a-

289
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:26,474
What part of being infected with
a deadly disease do you find funny?

290
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:28,675
- I don't think it's funny, Kyle.
- Then stop saying

291
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:31,945
you're not just sure,
you're HIV-positive!

292
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:37,032
This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny,
dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!

293
00:16:38,604 --> 00:16:41,651
Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying
to keep some optimism, you know?

294
00:16:41,771 --> 00:16:42,939
I mean, sometimes when things...

295
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:45,074
seem their darkest you just
need to try and stay...

296
00:16:45,194 --> 00:16:47,855
HIV-positive, but if you wanna
be so HIV-negative all the time, I-

297
00:16:47,975 --> 00:16:49,545
Knock it off! Right now!

298
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:52,970
This isn't funny!

299
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,540
At all!

300
00:16:55,345 --> 00:16:57,440
- Are you sure!
- Yes!

301
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,264
Are you HIV-positive?

302
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:00,524
Ow, fuck, Kyle!

303
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:04,570
Boys, the truth is I don't know why
my body is so resistant to the virus.

304
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,685
I would love to know so I could
help others, but I just don't.

305
00:17:07,805 --> 00:17:08,992
Well I've been thinking:

306
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,094
maybe there's something
you've come into contact with

307
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:12,873
that hinders HIV from growing.

308
00:17:12,993 --> 00:17:15,396
Do you mind if we just look around?

309
00:17:15,516 --> 00:17:17,156
Well, not at all.

310
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:20,280
The pool is over there,
where I try to swim and stay in shape.

311
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,670
My kitchen is full
of pretty healthy food.

312
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,738
I don't know which thing it is that keeps
my T-cell count high, so I try it all.

313
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:28,263
But everyone tries that.

314
00:17:28,383 --> 00:17:30,995
There has to be something
you're exposed to that others aren't.

315
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:33,255
- Could we see where you sleep?
- Sure.

316
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:37,051
Just a pretty plain
old ordinary bedroom.

317
00:17:40,156 --> 00:17:41,156
Dude.

318
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:43,265
Oh, oh yeah, I. I don't trust banks.

319
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:45,225
I sleep with all my money.

320
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:48,586
You sleep with money. Every night?

321
00:17:48,706 --> 00:17:51,135
Yeah, I like to keep it close b-

322
00:17:51,255 --> 00:17:53,555
...You don't think that..?

323
00:17:54,161 --> 00:17:56,362


324
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,894
It's incredible.

325
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:04,876
Mitch, these boys could be
onto something. Take a look.

326
00:18:04,996 --> 00:18:07,179
That's a sample of HIV-infected blood.

327
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,875
You can clearly see the HIV
attacking the white blood cells, right?

328
00:18:10,135 --> 00:18:14,205
All right. Watch what happens
when we introduce some cash.

329
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:17,216
My God. The HIV particles are receding!

330
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,763
The cash does seem to retrain
the HIV cells from stabilizing.

331
00:18:23,255 --> 00:18:24,561
Now hold on!

332
00:18:24,681 --> 00:18:28,352
All the cash is doing is destabilizing
the virus, not destroying it.

333
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:33,065
Well look, if being around lots of cash
negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...

334
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:34,325
Then maybe enough cash

335
00:18:34,445 --> 00:18:37,624
shot directly into the bloodstream
could kill the virus altogether.

336
00:18:37,744 --> 00:18:40,197
I have enough cash for all three of us!
We should give it a try!

337
00:18:40,457 --> 00:18:42,165
Na-noo, it's ridiculous.

338
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:44,635
We need FDA approval, control studies!

339
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:46,676
I'm sorry, but this is impossible!

340
00:18:46,796 --> 00:18:50,332
These boys have shown us that
a lot of impossible things can happen.

341
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:54,628
Their friendship has conquered every
obstacle in their illness-ridden lives.

342
00:18:55,988 --> 00:18:59,139
Their incredible friendship has brought
a sparkle of hope to our world,

343
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:00,259
that's for sure.

344
00:19:02,521 --> 00:19:06,145
I suppose we could try to
distill Magic's cash down to its...

345
00:19:06,265 --> 00:19:08,227
most highly-contrated level and...

346
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,602
try it on one of them.
But it's very risky.

347
00:19:10,945 --> 00:19:13,759
Yeah well, if there's a chance
of being cured of this illness,

348
00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:16,442
then Kyle is willing to take that risk.

349
00:19:45,949 --> 00:19:48,599
Let's hope to Christ this works.

350
00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:56,112
Wait a minute...

351
00:19:56,232 --> 00:19:58,432
Yes... Yes, take a look!

352
00:19:59,196 --> 00:20:03,846
The cash particles have completely
replaced all the HIV in Kyle's blood!

353
00:20:06,317 --> 00:20:09,411
Boys, you just found the cure for AIDS.

354
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:11,371
All right!

355
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:15,496
They found the cure for AIDS!
The cure for AIDS!

356
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:19,338
- What is it?
- Large doses of concentrated cash!

357
00:20:19,598 --> 00:20:22,341
- Get the media on the phone!
- All right!

358
00:20:23,036 --> 00:20:26,340
Scientists have just discovered
the cure... for AIDS.

359
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,307
About a hundred and eighty thousand
dollars shot directly into the bloodstream.

360
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,405


361
00:20:34,725 --> 00:20:37,326
Hey! They just found the cure for AIDS!

362
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:41,096
You just have to inject
yourself with all your cash!

363
00:20:45,604 --> 00:20:50,172
I am pleased to announce that there
is no trace of the HIV virus in either

364
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,412
Kyle Broflovski or Eric Cartman.

365
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,835
Together these boys beat their illness.

366
00:20:56,955 --> 00:21:00,019
With nothing but each other,
and overcoming all odds,

367
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:02,548
these two brave friends-

368
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:05,090
Oh stop! We're not friends!

369
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,302
He's the one who infected me with AIDS!

370
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,858
These two brave lovers...

371
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,221
found the cure and helped the world.

372
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:15,932
And so, to honor these boys,

373
00:21:16,052 --> 00:21:17,488
here is...

374
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:19,131
Jimmy Buffett!

375
00:21:19,251 --> 00:21:20,649
What? Aw, no!

376
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,131
Cureburger in paradise!

377
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,906
Cureburger. There I said it twice!

378
00:21:28,713 --> 00:21:30,463
Aw, Godddamnit!

379
00:21:31,128 --> 00:21:35,678
Well I'll tell you this, Kyle.
I'm never getting my tonsils out again.

380
00:21:36,331 --> 00:21:38,981
I'm still breaking your Xbox.

381
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,087
What? No. No. Kyle, no!

382
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:46,697
