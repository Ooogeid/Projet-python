South Park - Season 11 Episode 3
"Lice Capades"

2
00:00:32,988 --> 00:00:35,546
All right students,
let's take our seats.

3
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:38,555
Apparently we have a little
problem here at the school

4
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:40,278
which we need to talk about.

5
00:00:40,396 --> 00:00:43,421
Ah yes, you mean the Jew problem.

6
00:00:43,482 --> 00:00:46,162
Good, good ! I'm glad we're
finally gonna do something about it.

7
00:00:46,163 --> 00:00:48,954
No, I mean the problem of head lice.

8
00:00:49,077 --> 00:00:51,989
There's been a lice breakout
at a school in Denver,

9
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,363
and we need to make sure
nobody spreads it here.

10
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:57,368
- Somebody might have lice ?
- Ew !

11
00:00:57,467 --> 00:01:01,826
So today, you're all going to the
gymnasium to have your scalps examined.

12
00:01:01,998 --> 00:01:04,008
That is completely unnecessary,

13
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:06,569
everyone knows that only
poor people can get lice.

14
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,071
The only person that can
spread it here is Kenny.

15
00:01:09,072 --> 00:01:10,382
(What ? Fuck you !)

16
00:01:10,464 --> 00:01:13,276
I'm sure this class is clean,
but we're going to be examined,

17
00:01:13,277 --> 00:01:17,156
so that if anyone has the lice,
we can stop it before it spreads.

18
00:01:17,628 --> 00:01:20,123
Lice can live in anybody's hair.

19
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:37,234
Hello, Kelly. How's my baby ?

20
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,533
You mean me or the little one ?

21
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:41,071
I mean both.

22
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:44,039
Well besides a little loneliness
waiting for daddy to come home,

23
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,976
I guess we're both okay.

24
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:50,130
How did a louse like me get so
lucky to have louse like you.

25
00:01:50,169 --> 00:01:52,569
Luck had nothing to do with it, Travis.

26
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,660
It's about to come down !
Good, good ! Watch your back !

27
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,311
- You okay ?
- Sometimes,

28
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,682
I just worry what kind of world
our baby is going to grow up in.

29
00:02:06,036 --> 00:02:09,252
I need to run up to the forest
and do another sediment analysis.

30
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:12,359
I'm worried we might be
overworking the tertiary layer.

31
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:20,994
All students make sure you're
in line according to your grade.

32
00:02:21,096 --> 00:02:22,745
When you reach the front of line

33
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:26,251
you will go behind the curtain
and remove any hats to be checked.

34
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:31,040
Boy, I sure hope they
don't find lice in my hair.

35
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,847
What do you think happens
if you do have it ?

36
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:35,686
They drag you out of here, put
you in this big containment facility,

37
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:38,503
where they stick a cold metal pipe
up your ass with this clear jelly,

38
00:02:38,504 --> 00:02:40,334
And then they shock your balls.

39
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:43,670
I'm clean ! I knew I didn't
have any stupid lice !

40
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:45,726
This is ridiculous !

41
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:48,604
All this just so they can send
Kenny and his stupid head lice home.

42
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,940
(You fuck off !)

43
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:53,785
Have a seat of the stool.

44
00:03:22,698 --> 00:03:24,611
Oh, oh ! Looks like you got'em.

45
00:03:24,673 --> 00:03:26,424
- What ?
- You have lice.

46
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:28,300
Let's see, Klyde Harris is it ?

47
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,212
Oh my God ! Oh Christ no !

48
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,839
Now, now ! It's all right !

49
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,130
We're going to call your parents
and get you to your doctor.

50
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:40,773
Please, you don't understand ! The other
kids are gonna make fun of me forever !

51
00:03:40,922 --> 00:03:43,340
I'm sure your friends aren't that cruel.

52
00:03:43,341 --> 00:03:44,541
Yes, they are !

53
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,501
Mr. President ! Mr. President, I
believe we have a serious problem.

54
00:03:50,707 --> 00:03:53,030
The environment is changing.

55
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:56,585
I believe it is somehow
reacting to our presence on it.

56
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,970
And what do you base this on ?

57
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:01,040
Look, this is the world, right ?

58
00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:04,832
But now, think of the
world as a living being.

59
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:07,791
If it were somehow conscious,

60
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:10,395
then it would ultimately become
aware of our effect on it.

61
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:14,741
Huh, right, the world is
conscious. It makes perfect sense.

62
00:04:15,915 --> 00:04:17,953
Hello ? Anybody ?

63
00:04:19,558 --> 00:04:22,129
If we have made too much of an impact,

64
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,943
then that consciousness
will try to snuff us out.

65
00:04:24,944 --> 00:04:27,229
I think we're looking
at a global catastrophe,

66
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,488
the likes of which we've never seen.

67
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,306
Poodiggery and poppycock !

68
00:04:31,553 --> 00:04:34,649
I think we need to put all resources
now into a full investigation,

69
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,980
perhaps even begin a
lice wide evacuation.

70
00:04:37,062 --> 00:04:40,480
Evacuation ?
Tomorrow is the Gootack Festival.

71
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,326
Do you know how much
money we would lose ?

72
00:04:42,374 --> 00:04:46,686
Escort Mr. Mayfield out. The President
can't be bothered any further.

73
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:50,717
Damn you, Vice President Craig !
You could be killing us all !

74
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:55,681
This is so embarrassing.

75
00:04:56,555 --> 00:04:59,483
I have an ear infection. What
are you seeing the doctor for ?

76
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:01,893
I have...

77
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:03,358
I have AIDS.

78
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,293
Clyde Harris ?

79
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:10,339
Yeah, that's a pretty
bad lice problem there.

80
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,064
Good thing they pulled
you out of school.

81
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:15,578
But why me, doctor ?
Why me ! How did I get this ?

82
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:20,008
Well, believe it or not, some lice
can actually attach themselves to flies,

83
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:23,628
And then wait for the fly to land on
someone's head were they can reproduce.

84
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:26,831
And then the lice that live in your
head now are probably all born there.

85
00:05:26,832 --> 00:05:27,894
Sick !

86
00:05:28,044 --> 00:05:29,774
This shampoo should take care of it.

87
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:33,025
Use this in the shower. Your
scalp may burn a bit afterwards, but...

88
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,816
It should kill...
every last one of them.

89
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,991
Travis, everything okay ?

90
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:50,090
Kelly, I was just
thinking about our baby.

91
00:05:50,145 --> 00:05:53,020
I want to name her... Hope.

92
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:57,078
- Hope ?
- Hope for a... chance at tomorrow ?

93
00:06:02,507 --> 00:06:04,419
It's raining, now ?

94
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:22,039
I love the rain !

95
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,003
Oh my God.

96
00:06:27,097 --> 00:06:29,773
- We have to get out of here.
- What ? It's just rain.

97
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:32,275
We have to get out of here now, Kelly !

98
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,212
What is that ?

99
00:07:16,814 --> 00:07:20,646
Everyone get up into the trees !
We have to get up high !

100
00:07:22,338 --> 00:07:23,786
Come on, Kelly !

101
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:39,753
My God, Travis ! They're all dying !

102
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,980
Don't look Kelly ! Don't look !

103
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:44,144
What the hell is it ? !

104
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:46,560
It's okay, we're safe up here.

105
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:51,478
I don't think so.

106
00:08:08,345 --> 00:08:10,974
- Travis !
- Kelly ! Hang on !

107
00:08:11,548 --> 00:08:13,762
I can't hang on !

108
00:08:13,865 --> 00:08:16,650
You have to ! For the baby !

109
00:08:22,947 --> 00:08:24,693
Kelly ! !

110
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:25,953
No ! !

111
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:29,219
NOOOOOO ! !

112
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,603
Okay kids, today we're going
to review some Civil War history.

113
00:08:45,604 --> 00:08:47,645
Who can tell me what
year the war started ?

114
00:08:47,646 --> 00:08:49,502
Wait, wait ! whoa whoa ! So what happened ?

115
00:08:49,764 --> 00:08:51,867
- With what ?
- With the lice exam.

116
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:53,968
Did they find anybody with lice ?

117
00:08:55,506 --> 00:08:59,686
Yes, some lice was discovered
and the proper action has been taken.

118
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,422
Somebody in this class ?

119
00:09:01,678 --> 00:09:02,945
Uh, yes.

120
00:09:03,306 --> 00:09:04,056
Oh ! !

121
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:06,987
Who was it ? It was Kenny, right ?

122
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:09,116
That doesn't matter, it's over.

123
00:09:09,117 --> 00:09:10,133
Doesn't matter ?

124
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:13,511
If somebody had parasites in their hair,
we need to know who !

125
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:14,641
It was Kenny, wasn't it ?

126
00:09:14,642 --> 00:09:16,450
I wanna know who it was too !

127
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:19,043
It's been kept confidential.

128
00:09:19,044 --> 00:09:22,498
There's a policy in the school
not to single out a kid who has lice,

129
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:25,232
because of the embarrassment
it can cause, okay ?

130
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:26,689
That is bullcrap !

131
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,012
You're denying our rights as
children to totally rip on that kid

132
00:09:30,013 --> 00:09:31,933
and make him or her
feel like an outcast.

133
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:32,705
Yeah !

134
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:33,812
And we have a right to know

135
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:36,569
which boy had lice in his hair
so we don't ever go out with them !

136
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,904
How do we know it was a boy ?

137
00:09:37,905 --> 00:09:40,310
It could just as easily
be one of you stupid girls !

138
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:41,774
Yeah ! Dumb girls !

139
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:46,140
The case is closed.
Who ever had the lice they're dead now.

140
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:51,008
We're moving on to Civil War history.
Ulysses S. Grant...

141
00:09:59,326 --> 00:10:01,853
Hope ! Hope, you're alive !

142
00:10:10,706 --> 00:10:12,465
My God...

143
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:17,093
Help me...

144
00:10:17,382 --> 00:10:19,706
Help me...

145
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:21,317
Travis !

146
00:10:21,477 --> 00:10:22,596
Over here !

147
00:10:24,715 --> 00:10:28,465
Travis, if you hadn't warned us to get
up and down the trees, we'd all be dead.

148
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:30,322
How many survivors ?

149
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,826
Just the six of us.
And the Vice President.

150
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,567
Son of a bitch !
You had a chance to stop this !

151
00:10:39,568 --> 00:10:42,936
So help me, if we live through this,
I'm gonna see you rot in prison !

152
00:10:42,937 --> 00:10:45,899
- What do we do now ?
- We're not out of this yet.

153
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,572
You too look for other survivors.

154
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:50,389
You get whatever food
you can and bring it back here.

155
00:10:50,547 --> 00:10:52,932
Who put you in charge ?

156
00:10:53,596 --> 00:10:56,454
God did. When he killed my wife.

157
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:04,096
All right, the person who had
head lice needs to speak up right now,

158
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,522
so that we know to stay away from you.

159
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:10,588
Yeah, come on !
We're gonna find out sooner or later.

160
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:15,548
Okay, whoever you are, you're
now not only a lice head, you're a liar.

161
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,214
You're only making it worse on yourself.

162
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:18,395
You know what ?

163
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,171
- I bet it was you !
- Me ?

164
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:22,852
This is exactly what you would
do if they found lice in your hear.

165
00:11:22,853 --> 00:11:24,653
Try to lead the charge
against somebody else

166
00:11:24,654 --> 00:11:26,231
to take the suspicion off of yourself !

167
00:11:26,232 --> 00:11:27,850
I don't think so, Kyle.

168
00:11:27,851 --> 00:11:30,995
But you know what, this is exactly
what you would do if you had head lice.

169
00:11:30,996 --> 00:11:32,766
Try to get everyone to blame me !

170
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:34,900
You guys, stop it.
This isn't getting us anywhere.

171
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:37,520
That's exactly what you would
do if you had head lice, Stan.

172
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:40,556
Yeah, try to have everyone make peace
so it doesn't seem like a big deal.

173
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:43,543
And this is exactly what Kenny would do.
Stand here and say nothing.

174
00:11:43,544 --> 00:11:45,339
Hey guys ! What would I do ?

175
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,116
Let's just get a magnifying
glass and look in everyone's heads.

176
00:11:48,117 --> 00:11:50,329
It's too late.
The treatment would have killed it all.

177
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,850
Well I guess we're never gonna know.
There's no way to tell.

178
00:11:52,851 --> 00:11:56,206
There's a way ! There's a way to
find out who had sick-ass head cooties !

179
00:11:56,207 --> 00:11:57,807
And I'm gonna find it !

180
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,174
It was him. It had to have been him !

181
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,282
Yeah...

182
00:12:06,645 --> 00:12:07,495
Or you.

183
00:12:10,838 --> 00:12:13,223
Mark ? Mark, you have to hang on.

184
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:16,864
This isn't going to stop.
The world is rejecting us !

185
00:12:16,865 --> 00:12:19,227
If we're gonna live,
we have to get off this planet.

186
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:20,023
How ?

187
00:12:20,024 --> 00:12:22,692
First we have to get out of the forest,
into the forbidden zone.

188
00:12:22,693 --> 00:12:25,793
It's the only way we
might even see another planet !

189
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:29,801
The forbidden zone...
We'll be exposed. We'll die out there.

190
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:34,313
We'll die here ! Look, the world
is getting rid of us ! Don't you get it ? !

191
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:37,990
Getting rid of us ? You-you
mean like it knows what it's doing ?

192
00:12:38,273 --> 00:12:42,047
Yes ! Because maybe we
rolled the dice too many times !

193
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:46,796
- I'm not leaving my husband.
- Yeah, I'll take my chances here.

194
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:50,484
You can all stay here.
I'm gonna try to save my baby.

195
00:12:51,862 --> 00:12:54,886
I'll go with you.
There's nothing left for me here.

196
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:57,788
- I wanna go too.
- Not a chance.

197
00:12:57,837 --> 00:13:00,202
Look, I know I messed up, all right ?

198
00:13:00,203 --> 00:13:01,659
But I think you're right.

199
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,814
If we can get out of the forest,
we might find another place to live.

200
00:13:05,023 --> 00:13:07,734
If we find anything, we'll
try to send help for the rest of you.

201
00:13:08,306 --> 00:13:12,491
Let's go. Come on if you're
coming Mister Vice President !

202
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,836
Yeah. Right behind you.

203
00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:22,707
All right, lock that door, Craig !

204
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,480
What's this about, Cartman ?

205
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:26,299
I've come up with
a test that can determine

206
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,392
if it was any of us
who had the head lice.

207
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:31,929
We're gonna find out once
and for all who had head cooties.

208
00:13:35,476 --> 00:13:37,804
Lice feed on a person's blood,
and just like mosquitoes

209
00:13:37,805 --> 00:13:40,651
they leave small traces of
their saliva in the host's bloodstream.

210
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:42,670
That saliva, is monochromagnic.

211
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,317
So if an infected person's blood is
touched by... this hot metal coil, say,

212
00:13:46,318 --> 00:13:49,518
that person's blood will
jump 10 meters into the air.

213
00:13:50,354 --> 00:13:52,012
Ur ur re- ur really ?

214
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:55,036
That's retarded ! You didn't
come up with that experiment, Cartman,

215
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:57,337
you saw it in that movie, The Thing !

216
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,448
This is a scientific test, designed to-

217
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:02,891
You saw it in The Thing and
you're wasting everyone's time !

218
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:04,252
I thought you might say that Kyle.

219
00:14:04,253 --> 00:14:06,173
Because you don't want
to take the test do you ?

220
00:14:06,174 --> 00:14:08,054
Nobody's blood is going
to jump up in the air !

221
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,255
If it isn't going to work
then what are you afraid of ?

222
00:14:10,256 --> 00:14:12,776
The only person who wouldn't
want to take the test is somebody

223
00:14:12,777 --> 00:14:15,657
who was worried it might work
and reveal they were the ones with lice !

224
00:14:15,658 --> 00:14:17,018
Yeah. That's true.

225
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:20,166
I have no problem taking the test.
I have nothing to hi-huhiii-hide

226
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,740
Yeah. Me neither.

227
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:24,063
All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.

228
00:14:24,099 --> 00:14:26,106
Everyone take a Petri
dish and a syringe.

229
00:14:26,107 --> 00:14:28,583
We need at least 30 cc's
of blood from each one of you.

230
00:14:32,527 --> 00:14:35,822
All right, now everyone back over there !
We'll start with what I already know.

231
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:42,805
Well, guess that proves Eric
wasn't the one with head lice.

232
00:14:42,806 --> 00:14:44,489
It doesn't prove anything !

233
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,773
Yeah ? Let's just see
what your blood does, Kyle !

234
00:14:52,396 --> 00:14:54,167
Huh, I guess you're clean.

235
00:14:56,232 --> 00:14:58,629
Ye-you guys, we'd better go.
Recess is almost over.

236
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:00,741
It's all right,
it won't take much longer to-

237
00:15:01,457 --> 00:15:02,707
What the hell ? !

238
00:15:05,132 --> 00:15:06,362
Kenny ! !

239
00:15:06,976 --> 00:15:08,120
No way.

240
00:15:08,218 --> 00:15:10,579
You were right all along, Eric.
It was Kenny.

241
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:13,935
Of course I was right !
I told you only poor people get lice !

242
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,230
We've done it.
We've reached the forbidden zone.

243
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:30,324
I've always heard stories about
this place. Never thought it was real.

244
00:15:30,582 --> 00:15:34,824
It's real.
Real as my love for my unborn baby.

245
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:37,492
So what exactly is your plan, Travis ?

246
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:40,324
Our ancestors came
here from another world.

247
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:43,455
Maybe there's still other worlds
out there with life forms like us.

248
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:45,211
Maybe there's even a world

249
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:48,918
where they've learned to live
with the planet instead of just on it.

250
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,083
Travis.

251
00:15:50,487 --> 00:15:53,333
Travis, you're, so wise, so strong.

252
00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:57,956
If we make it out of this,
I'd like to... be with you.

253
00:15:58,078 --> 00:15:59,454
Sorry, babe,

254
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:04,286
but my heart is forever stenciled
in permanent ink with the name... Kelly.

255
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:08,640
- She was a lucky woman to have you.
- Luck had nothing to do with it.

256
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:14,730
Sorry to cut the honeymoon short !

257
00:16:14,828 --> 00:16:16,931
Why you murdering bastard !

258
00:16:17,238 --> 00:16:20,999
Your little fantasy of
another world ends here ! Walk !

259
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,931
What the hell do you want,
Vice President ? !

260
00:16:22,932 --> 00:16:23,768
WALK !

261
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,317
Clyde, dude, get down to the park.

262
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:32,728
We caught Kenny,
and we're all gonna let him have it !

263
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,396
What ? What are you gonna do to him ?

264
00:16:35,543 --> 00:16:39,614
He lied to us all ! He betrayed his kind !
We all know what has to happen.

265
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:42,650
Grab a sock and a bar of soap,
and meet us at the park !

266
00:16:44,618 --> 00:16:45,995
You guys, wait.

267
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:48,066
What, Clyde ?

268
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,580
I... nothing.

269
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:54,261
All right, see you there !
Remember, bar of soap and a sock !

270
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:56,063
- Kenny's gonna get it !
- Yeah !

271
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:58,916
Yeah ! We're gonna fu-, fu-, fuck him up !

272
00:17:03,637 --> 00:17:04,394
Yello ?

273
00:17:04,395 --> 00:17:06,795
Mrs. Garrison, one of your
students is about to be attacked

274
00:17:06,796 --> 00:17:08,419
at the park by all the other students.

275
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,916
What ? Who's going to get attacked ?
Who is this ? !

276
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:13,584
Please just hurry to the park !
You have to stop them !

277
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,937
That's good ! That's far enough !

278
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:20,629
What are you going to do ?

279
00:17:20,716 --> 00:17:23,579
I'm gonna go back to the village,
start to rebuild,

280
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:27,503
mate with the females,
become... President !

281
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,647
Don't you get it ?
The world doesn't want you here !

282
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,808
It's not gonna stop until you're dead !

283
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:35,397
It was a disaster ! Disasters happen !

284
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:38,606
Then go ahead and die there,
I'm leaving with my baby !

285
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:42,552
Actually, you're never
leaving here either, Travis !

286
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,770
Damn you ! Why ? !

287
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,328
Because when I'm President,
I can't have pests like you

288
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:53,188
constantly trying to preach
that the world is alive !

289
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:59,421
You're an idealistic fool ! The world
is not conscious, we are conscious !

290
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:02,631
If the world was alive,
it would feel this !

291
00:18:05,373 --> 00:18:06,123
Ow.

292
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:08,828
You die he-

293
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:34,529
Kenny McCormick, you are charged with
bringing head cooties into our school,

294
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,244
and lying about it to cover your ass !
How do you plead ?

295
00:18:37,245 --> 00:18:38,354
(Not guilty !)

296
00:18:38,355 --> 00:18:39,905
Guilty ! I thought so !

297
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:41,472
All right, let's do this !

298
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:44,397
You guys, maybe we should just...
wait a few more minutes ?

299
00:18:44,398 --> 00:18:46,783
All right, Kenny.
You know what has to happen !

300
00:18:46,845 --> 00:18:48,161
SOCK BATH !

301
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:52,181
Everyone wash Kenny with the soap
and dry him off with the socks !

302
00:18:52,977 --> 00:18:54,816
(No ! No no, you guys !)

303
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:56,853
The pain... the pain !

304
00:18:56,939 --> 00:18:59,202
Wait... stop it, stop it !

305
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,226
I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.

306
00:19:03,037 --> 00:19:04,869
He had cooties and he lied about it !

307
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:07,341
Kenny didn't have the head lice,
all right ? !

308
00:19:07,464 --> 00:19:08,614
It was me.

309
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,163
What ?

310
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:13,620
I was the one.
I was too afraid to say anything,

311
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:16,265
but I can't let Kenny
be sock-bathed for it.

312
00:19:16,434 --> 00:19:19,901
Why are you saying that, Kyle ?
You can't be the one who had head lice.

313
00:19:19,902 --> 00:19:22,084
Because I was.
You're just trying to make me feel bad

314
00:19:22,085 --> 00:19:23,774
because you figured that out,
didn't you ?

315
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,863
Wait a minute, what ?

316
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:27,447
Oh I get it.
This is some kind of big trick on me !

317
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:30,288
You've known I was the one
with head lice all along, huh ?

318
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:31,049
You had head lice ? ?

319
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,770
Of course !
Why do you think I went through

320
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,811
that elaborate bullcrap
experiment to frame Kenny ?

321
00:19:34,812 --> 00:19:36,765
You all had head lice !

322
00:19:36,889 --> 00:19:40,860
Every single person in the class !
The boys and the girls !

323
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:43,467
Lice spreads fast, you dumbasses !

324
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,507
- I thought I was the only one.
- Me too.

325
00:19:49,582 --> 00:19:50,836
But that means...

326
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:53,307
that means Kenny WAS lying !

327
00:19:53,755 --> 00:19:55,144
Sock bath !

328
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,431
- Sock bath !
- Dudes !

329
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,652
Kelly. Kelly, can you hear me ?

330
00:20:07,235 --> 00:20:09,091
I don't know if you can.

331
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:16,382
But... I wanted you to know I tried.
I tried to save our baby.

332
00:20:16,977 --> 00:20:19,116
But I let you down, babe.

333
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,486
K... Kelly ?

334
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:09,517
You are welcome here.

335
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:16,001
You're safe now.

336
00:21:16,002 --> 00:21:20,373
We've lived here for generation
after generation, never being disturbed.

337
