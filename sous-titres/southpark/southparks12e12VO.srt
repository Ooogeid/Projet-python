3
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:37,358
If there anyone out there tonight
who still doubts

4
00:00:37,478 --> 00:00:39,793
that America is a place
where all things are possible,

5
00:00:40,534 --> 00:00:44,233
who still wonders if the dream
of our founders is alive in our time,

6
00:00:44,695 --> 00:00:48,468
who still questions the power of our
democracy... Tonight is your answer.

7
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:53,639
Obama!

8
00:00:54,599 --> 00:00:55,579
We did it.

9
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:58,103
- We did it!
- <i>It's been a long time coming,</i>

10
00:00:58,263 --> 00:01:01,386
<i>but tonight, because of what we did
on this date in this election</i>

11
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:04,943
at this defining moment,
change has come to America.

12
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:09,020
Change!

13
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,199
It's change!

14
00:01:11,514 --> 00:01:14,327
Sasha and Malia, I love you both
more than you can imagine.

15
00:01:14,987 --> 00:01:18,269
You have earned the new puppy that's
coming with us to the White House.

16
00:01:18,389 --> 00:01:20,071
We will name him sparkles.

17
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,919
He's so awesome!

18
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,557
He's so perfect and awesome!

19
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:28,951
Where we are met with cynicism
and doubts and those who tell us

20
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:31,886
that we can't. We will respond
with that timeless creed

21
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:34,000
that sums up the spirit of a people.

22
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:35,526
Yes, we can.

23
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:37,712
Yes, we can!

24
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:39,842
Yes, I can.

25
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,646
Yes, I can.

26
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:44,983
Here comes the change, everybody!

27
00:01:47,238 --> 00:01:50,280
- Did you see? Our man is in!
- We did it.

28
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,741
Everything is gonna be awesome now!

29
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:55,217
This is the greatest day
of our lives!

30
00:01:55,337 --> 00:01:56,453
Yes, we can!

31
00:01:56,769 --> 00:01:58,496
I don't even know what to do now!

32
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:00,453
I know what to do!

33
00:02:01,745 --> 00:02:03,387
Losers.

34
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:05,879
Losers!

35
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:08,216
Losers!

36
00:02:08,865 --> 00:02:11,096
- Losers!
- Oh, shut up!

37
00:02:11,487 --> 00:02:13,166
- Losers.
- We lost?

38
00:02:13,946 --> 00:02:14,971
<i>It is natural.</i>

39
00:02:15,497 --> 00:02:18,266
<i>It's natural, tonight,
to feel some disappointment.</i>

40
00:02:18,544 --> 00:02:20,280
<i>We fought as hard as we could.</i>

41
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,012
And though we fell short,
the failure is mine not yours.

42
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:29,319
Poor old John McCain.
He looks real sad.

43
00:02:30,627 --> 00:02:31,933
This can't happen!

44
00:02:32,815 --> 00:02:33,781
Steven!

45
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:35,320
It's all over, Linda!

46
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,961
The country as we know
it is about to change.

47
00:02:38,914 --> 00:02:40,112
We're all dead.

48
00:02:40,757 --> 00:02:42,085
You don't know that!

49
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:44,840
With an inexperienced man
as president, we do know it!

50
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,712
He's right!
Game over, man, McCain?

51
00:02:48,149 --> 00:02:50,131
We'll probably be dead by sunrise!

52
00:02:50,694 --> 00:02:52,565
Butters, daddy loves you.

53
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:54,597
Just remember that.

54
00:02:55,046 --> 00:02:56,546
He always loved you.

55
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:01,361
Get outta here!

56
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:08,208
Dude, have you seen my parents?

57
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:10,693
Everyone's out partying
in the streets.

58
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:15,584
- What's wrong with your brother?
- He was an McCain supporter.

59
00:03:16,975 --> 00:03:19,018
It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine.

60
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:22,828
{\1:10AM}

61
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,319
- Mr. President! Over here, sir!
- Congratulations!

62
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,793
- Great job.
- Change.

63
00:03:27,036 --> 00:03:28,878
- Great job, Mr. President!
- Great job.

64
00:03:29,353 --> 00:03:31,768
Thank you all for your support.
If you don't mind,

65
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:35,058
I'm gonna spend the rest of the evening
getting some much need rest.

66
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:40,723
Senator McCain?

67
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,575
President Obama.

68
00:03:50,932 --> 00:03:52,141
Boom, baby!

69
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:54,868
- Man, that was perfect!
- I almost thought

70
00:03:54,988 --> 00:03:57,719
we were gonna tie for a minute there.
That would have screwed us.

71
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:59,853
You played it perfectly.
There was no way.

72
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,233
It's McCain. We did it.

73
00:04:01,353 --> 00:04:02,739
Obama is president.

74
00:04:03,383 --> 00:04:06,804
Yeah, so I've heard. You guys are out
of your freaking minds, you know that?

75
00:04:06,924 --> 00:04:10,269
We do. Assemble the rest of the team.
We've only got ten hours.

76
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:12,094
Sure. Hard part's over, right?

77
00:04:12,214 --> 00:04:14,512
Actually,
the hard part's just starting.

78
00:04:31,652 --> 00:04:35,479
Celebrate good Obama, come on.

79
00:04:37,056 --> 00:04:39,205
It's Obama, Obama.

80
00:04:46,323 --> 00:04:48,413
I'd like to make a noise complaint.

81
00:04:55,374 --> 00:04:57,800
Who let the obama out?

82
00:05:03,313 --> 00:05:05,004
Oh, police are here!

83
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:10,935
Okay, people. Time to disperse.

84
00:05:11,055 --> 00:05:12,106
Party's over.

85
00:05:14,017 --> 00:05:15,318
It's a party!

86
00:05:15,978 --> 00:05:17,654
Come on. Time to go home.

87
00:05:18,187 --> 00:05:20,159
What are you, an McCain voter?

88
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,215
Sorry, pal.
But Obama's president now.

89
00:05:31,304 --> 00:05:33,836
Flip the cop car!
Flip the cop car!

90
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,218
Put down my car!

91
00:05:37,152 --> 00:05:38,479
Yes, we can!

92
00:05:41,737 --> 00:05:42,845
Stop it!

93
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,139
Jesus Christ.

94
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:49,477
Obama, you're so fine,
you're so fine you blow my mind.

95
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:56,877
You guys wanna buy a TV?

96
00:06:12,323 --> 00:06:14,252
Bravo, Obama and McCain.

97
00:06:14,617 --> 00:06:18,756
Ten years you two have been working on
this plan and you finally pulled it off.

98
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:23,332
Guys, we've all known each other a long
time, had many incredible adventures,

99
00:06:23,452 --> 00:06:26,097
but this is going to be
our greatest feat ever.

100
00:06:26,632 --> 00:06:27,675
I knew it!

101
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:31,249
I knew when you two ran for president
you were just working an angle.

102
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:33,062
Always working the angles.

103
00:06:33,512 --> 00:06:37,204
My friends, while the entire country
is busy reacting to the election,

104
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:41,234
we are about to pull off
the greatest heist in human history.

105
00:06:42,646 --> 00:06:44,572
So, come on. Enlighten us.

106
00:06:44,865 --> 00:06:46,826
What are we stealing this time?

107
00:06:53,156 --> 00:06:54,410
The hope diamond.

108
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,430
Rated number four on the ten most
precious diamonds in the world.

109
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,965
Going street value, middle eastern
market, of course, $210 million.

110
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,551
210?

111
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,053
Million.

112
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,599
The hope diamond is ungettable.
Every thief in the world knows that.

113
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,642
Almost ungettable.

114
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,740
The diamond is kept in the Smithsonian
natural history museum

115
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,016
long considered to be the most
thief-proof structure ever built.

116
00:07:19,235 --> 00:07:20,688
The diamond wing is protected

117
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,635
by impenetrable walls
of two-foot wide steel.

118
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:25,323
On the northeast side,
a seven-five laser system.

119
00:07:25,816 --> 00:07:28,534
There is simply no side
of the Smithsonian that can be breached.

120
00:07:29,246 --> 00:07:30,602
So you go in from the roof.

121
00:07:30,722 --> 00:07:33,229
- Drop into it from the top.
- Can't get to it from the top.

122
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:35,780
Because of a polymer shelf running
the entire expanse.

123
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,515
You can't get into the museum from any
side and you can't drop from above.

124
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:41,547
So you can't get the diamond.

125
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,551
Meet the presidential escape tunnel.

126
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:48,303
A two-mile long underground passage
that runs from the White House

127
00:07:48,423 --> 00:07:51,033
to a location outside the city limits
in case of an attack.

128
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:55,353
The tunnel is only accessible from the
oval office and just happens to travel

129
00:07:55,513 --> 00:07:58,898
right underneath the Smithsonian
national history museum.

130
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:00,949
Boom, baby.

131
00:08:01,596 --> 00:08:04,613
You get somebody into that tunnel,
they can blast into the museum,

132
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:05,850
let the others in.

133
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,240
The heist is on.

134
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:11,107
So you both run for president,
because one of you has to win

135
00:08:11,227 --> 00:08:13,037
and you've got
your access to the tunnel.

136
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,065
And we run
a particularly brutal campaign

137
00:08:16,185 --> 00:08:20,432
so that the nation is as distracted
as possible over the next eight hours.

138
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:23,172
This all sounds very risky.

139
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:25,890
We've spent ten years putting
this plan together.

140
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,498
If we are indeed the greatest
thief club in the world...

141
00:08:28,618 --> 00:08:29,637
and we are.

142
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:31,551
... we won't get caught.

143
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:35,322
I'm trying to locate my parents.

144
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:37,613
My name is Kyle Broflovski.

145
00:08:38,493 --> 00:08:39,926
I know Obama won.

146
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:42,551
- You gotta get out here!
- What?

147
00:08:42,671 --> 00:08:45,483
Your little brother's climbed out onto
the window. I think he's going to jump!

148
00:08:45,603 --> 00:08:46,705
Oh, my God.

149
00:08:50,742 --> 00:08:53,536
Ike, don't do it!
There's still so much to live for.

150
00:08:57,086 --> 00:09:00,376
I know you really wanted McCain to win,
but it's going to be okay.

151
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:06,676
That's not true!

152
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,343
The economy could easily stabilize
with Obama's plan.

153
00:09:11,276 --> 00:09:13,890
Don't jump! You could really hurt
your ankle or something.

154
00:09:16,558 --> 00:09:19,564
Really, that's like five feet
off the ground. Don't do it.

155
00:09:20,414 --> 00:09:21,834
Goodbye!

156
00:09:27,718 --> 00:09:28,752
Oh, crap.

157
00:09:33,024 --> 00:09:35,185
All right, everyone.
I'm turning in for the night.

158
00:09:35,305 --> 00:09:39,296
- Go to standard security, team three.
- Sir, we have a bit of a problem.

159
00:09:39,617 --> 00:09:41,800
- What?
- The new president-elect is here.

160
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,785
He wants in to the oval office.

161
00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:54,734
They're all right through here, sir.

162
00:09:56,023 --> 00:09:58,684
Hello. Is there something
we can do for you, Mr. Obama?

163
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,985
Just checking out the new digs.

164
00:10:01,105 --> 00:10:02,188
How are you guys?

165
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:04,207
Good, sir.

166
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,525
I'd like to see
the oval office, please.

167
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,819
Right now?

168
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:10,496
I don't waste time, gentlemen.

169
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:13,193
I've only got 2 months to figure out
how I want to redecorate,

170
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:16,619
if you know what I mean.
You know, change the drapes and stuff.

171
00:10:17,873 --> 00:10:19,868
Sure. Right this way, Mr.

172
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:21,165
President.

173
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,424
I will need absolute privacy.
Is that understood?

174
00:10:26,953 --> 00:10:27,965
Thanks.

175
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,536
I got $100!

176
00:10:32,695 --> 00:10:34,303
All right, McCain. I'm in.

177
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:36,246
Nicely done, b.

178
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:38,302
We're in position
outside the Smithsonian.

179
00:10:38,422 --> 00:10:39,809
You find the escape tunnel?

180
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,519
I'm already on it.

181
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:44,895
Boom, baby.

182
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:55,756
Change!

183
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,782
- Change!
- Change!

184
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:00,149
Dad, Dad, we have a problem.

185
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:02,599
Not anymore we don't.
Everything's different now.

186
00:11:02,776 --> 00:11:04,955
No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother
to the hospital.

187
00:11:05,075 --> 00:11:06,934
We don't have to take crap

188
00:11:07,054 --> 00:11:09,171
from the rich fat cats anymore.

189
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:11,007
Dude, he's wasted.

190
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:13,551
Hey, it's my boss!
Hey, boss!

191
00:11:16,181 --> 00:11:18,690
Yeah, you know what?
Fuck you!

192
00:11:19,526 --> 00:11:22,153
You heard me, you piece of shit!

193
00:11:22,341 --> 00:11:24,779
I can finally tell you
what I think of you.

194
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:26,063
Asshole.

195
00:11:26,223 --> 00:11:29,326
- Dad, what are you doing?
- It's okay, Stan! Everything's changed.

196
00:11:29,786 --> 00:11:33,095
I don't need
his stupid fucking job anymore.

197
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:37,151
You're a little asshole,
piece of shit!

198
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:40,354
You know what Obama said?
"Yes, we can!"

199
00:11:40,814 --> 00:11:44,716
- Hey, I voted for Obama!
- Obama's not talking about you!

200
00:11:45,194 --> 00:11:47,697
Can someone help us?
My little brother fell out the window!

201
00:11:51,225 --> 00:11:54,216
I just want to say to everyone
who's a little disappointed

202
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,720
that we lost the election
that there's always next year!

203
00:11:57,963 --> 00:12:01,265
Maybe I'll run for
vice president again in 2009!

204
00:12:03,538 --> 00:12:06,562
Mrs. Palin, have you seen
or heard from John McCain?

205
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,606
I don't really know where he went.

206
00:12:10,726 --> 00:12:13,367
Kind of seems a little odd,
I guess, but...

207
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,722
Oh, my phone's going ringy.

208
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,489
Excuse me.

209
00:12:20,268 --> 00:12:21,911
Hello, Sarah.
It's McCain.

210
00:12:22,562 --> 00:12:24,037
I hope you're going to tell me

211
00:12:24,157 --> 00:12:26,415
you're in position below the vault
with the l-7 charges?

212
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,627
I'm in the tunnel now.
Should be almost below the museum.

213
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:32,736
Just make sure you don't blow
the transformers along with the tunnel

214
00:12:32,856 --> 00:12:34,673
because it will trigger
the 5.4 laser system.

215
00:12:34,915 --> 00:12:36,537
<i>And don't damage any coupling wires</i>

216
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:38,594
<i>or it'll be worthless
when we shut down the grid.</i>

217
00:12:38,754 --> 00:12:41,972
- <i>I'll be there in 30.</i>
- God, she's awesome.

218
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:46,435
I guess senator McCain's
gonna fly me back to Alaska now.

219
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:50,002
He's got a private jet, you know.
Okay. Bye-bye, then!

220
00:12:52,247 --> 00:12:53,526
Bloody idiots.

221
00:13:01,716 --> 00:13:03,437
All right. Here we go.

222
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:09,708
- What's that noise?
- It's okay. Just construction outside.

223
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:24,239
We've got a problem.

224
00:13:30,626 --> 00:13:32,834
Hang in there, Ike.
We're gonna get you help.

225
00:13:34,678 --> 00:13:35,860
There's some people.

226
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:41,475
Listen! Stay back!
Stay back!

227
00:13:41,595 --> 00:13:43,826
We don't have
any more room in the ark!

228
00:13:44,184 --> 00:13:46,495
You have to let us in.
You know the country is doomed.

229
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:48,038
Who are you to turn us away?

230
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:51,876
I built this bunker in case McCain lost!
There isn't enough room for everyone.

231
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:54,321
Excuse me, but we need some help.

232
00:13:54,441 --> 00:13:56,922
I know you do but there's
no more room, I tell ya!

233
00:13:57,299 --> 00:13:59,022
You're going to deny them, too?

234
00:13:59,301 --> 00:14:01,274
God sake's man, they're children!

235
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:04,337
Look them in the eyes and tell them
you won't take them in.

236
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:07,600
- Look at their little cheeks!
- Let go of my face, asshole.

237
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:09,727
All right, damn you.
They can come in!

238
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:12,010
We don't want
in your stupid shelter.

239
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,237
- Okay, then I want their place.
- Me, too.

240
00:14:14,357 --> 00:14:16,151
We need to get a ride
to the hospital.

241
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:19,195
There isn't going to be a hospital.
Don't you get it?

242
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,844
Let us in now!

243
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,536
Jeez. It's already happening.
Society's breaking down.

244
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:30,103
Obama hasn't even been elected
four hours

245
00:14:30,223 --> 00:14:32,166
and already the country
is going to hell.

246
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:43,912
All right. Give me the keys.

247
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,890
Is there a problem, gentlemen?

248
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:51,769
No, sir.
Everything okay in there?

249
00:14:52,286 --> 00:14:53,556
Why wouldn't it be?

250
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:55,564
I'm sorry, but I asked
to be left alone.

251
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:58,984
Yes, sir.
It's just that your wife is here.

252
00:14:59,722 --> 00:15:02,738
- My wife?
- Everyone's been looking for you.

253
00:15:02,898 --> 00:15:04,451
What on Earth are you doing?

254
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:07,414
Come on in, darling.
Thank you, boys.

255
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,856
Tell me what's going on.

256
00:15:14,426 --> 00:15:17,187
Michelle, there's something
I need to tell you.

257
00:15:18,034 --> 00:15:19,322
What is it?

258
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:21,423
Barack, what is it?

259
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:24,305
The laser system guarding
the diamond

260
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:26,804
was replaced with an optical relay
three days ago.

261
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:30,129
You gotta be kidding me!

262
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:32,775
So the entire diamond vault
is inaccessible?

263
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:33,936
Is McCain online?

264
00:15:37,056 --> 00:15:39,441
Your guys weren't running
update checks on the security logs?

265
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,945
We need you to do a different scan hack
to the vault relay.

266
00:15:43,296 --> 00:15:46,047
On a new system, in an hour?
Are you nuts?

267
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:48,469
My job was to pretend
to be married to this bozo

268
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:50,786
and get you three scan hacks
into a laser system.

269
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,034
It's Sarah.

270
00:15:52,154 --> 00:15:55,001
They did replace the laser system,
but the new one isn't brand new.

271
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,294
It's an old h-7 series.
You can break this baby in 30 minutes.

272
00:15:59,498 --> 00:16:01,353
Tell Davis to get me
an foretrans emitter

273
00:16:01,473 --> 00:16:03,191
and enough pulse drives
to light a spark.

274
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:04,666
You catch that, Davis?

275
00:16:04,786 --> 00:16:05,968
<i>I'm on it.</i>

276
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:11,663
We made it, Ike.
You're going to be okay.

277
00:16:19,172 --> 00:16:20,976
There! Just take a seat over there.

278
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:23,755
Excuse me. My little brother
needs medical attention.

279
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,534
Was he an Obama supporter
or an McCain supporter?

280
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:28,032
Why does that matter?

281
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:31,285
Because I'll know if he partied too hard
or if he tried to kill himself.

282
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,249
Ma'am, please. I think my little brother
needs immediate help!

283
00:16:41,369 --> 00:16:44,315
You don't understand, kid.
There's only two doctors on call.

284
00:16:44,435 --> 00:16:47,257
And Dr. Wilson is out celebrating
in the streets somewhere.

285
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,965
So where's the other doctor?

286
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:55,326
Hey, come on, people!

287
00:16:55,573 --> 00:16:57,493
We can keep partying, can't we?

288
00:16:57,835 --> 00:16:59,107
Yes, we can!

289
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:01,156
Come on, let's sing!

290
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:05,861
"Obama well you came and you gave

291
00:17:06,245 --> 00:17:07,655
"Without taking"

292
00:17:09,191 --> 00:17:12,547
- Shut up!
- "But I sent you away Obama

293
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:16,497
"When you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking".

294
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,769
I've almost got it.

295
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,784
You're only going to have five minutes,
do you understand?

296
00:17:24,028 --> 00:17:26,375
Did you really not like
pretending to be married?

297
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:28,342
Jesus. Now is not the time, b.

298
00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:31,209
Come on, you have to admit
we had some fun.

299
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:33,979
My girls need somebody better
than a world class diamond thief.

300
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:35,391
Wait, there, I got it.

301
00:17:35,738 --> 00:17:38,477
All right, everyone. We're about to go.
So here's the revised schedule...

302
00:17:38,961 --> 00:17:41,980
4:40 a.m., the team gathers
at the northwest exit of the museum.

303
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:44,819
4:45 a.m., Michelle
hacks the optical relay

304
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,885
allowing me access to the rear doors.

305
00:17:47,005 --> 00:17:47,986
Go!

306
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,711
4:46, from inside I can open the doors
and let in the rest of the crew.

307
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:56,405
5:10 a.m., at the department of power,
Quincy shuts down the grid,

308
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:58,330
disabling power to the vault room.

309
00:17:58,692 --> 00:18:02,576
5:12, my grandmother who faked her death
calls in a bomb threat to the museum.

310
00:18:02,696 --> 00:18:05,546
I said I put a bomb
in your building, yes.

311
00:18:06,073 --> 00:18:10,020
5:13, the guards open on the southwest
door checking the museum for any bombs.

312
00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:13,079
5:14, McCain, dressed
as a football player,

313
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:15,681
enters security and shuts off
the diamond case alarm.

314
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,689
Hey, you! Stop!

315
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:27,192
Michelle and I head back into the tunnel
and the hole is patched.

316
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:31,238
5:15 a.m., I walk out
of the oval office

317
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:33,445
with the diamond securely
hidden in my anus.

318
00:18:33,965 --> 00:18:35,305
All done, thanks.

319
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,848
Boom, baby!

320
00:18:49,238 --> 00:18:50,257
Just one thing.

321
00:18:50,858 --> 00:18:53,906
Don't you think people are going
to be suspicious when you disappear?

322
00:18:54,026 --> 00:18:55,364
Go looking for you?

323
00:18:55,484 --> 00:18:57,734
We hired a guy for that
a couple months ago.

324
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,374
What the hell?

325
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:30,404
{\DECEASED}

326
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,762
Boom, baby.

327
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:02,525
Here are all the tickets
for your group, Mr. Sanchez.

328
00:20:02,645 --> 00:20:03,914
Thank you very much.

329
00:20:04,664 --> 00:20:06,666
Well, friends, let us depart.

330
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:10,715
You guys go ahead.

331
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,464
I just came to say goodbye.

332
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:14,235
What?

333
00:20:14,603 --> 00:20:17,803
I've decided to hang it up.
Maybe give this president thing a shot.

334
00:20:18,286 --> 00:20:19,780
B., you can't be serious.

335
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:22,474
Besides, you died in a jet in
the rocky mountains, remember?

336
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:25,625
Could have been
I didn't make that flight.

337
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,397
What do you say, Michelle?

338
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,064
Would you and your girls like
to move into the White House with me?

339
00:20:30,184 --> 00:20:33,610
You know, settle down, just be president
and first lady for a while?

340
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,487
You're serious.

341
00:20:35,983 --> 00:20:38,541
Who knows, maybe we
could change a few things.

342
00:20:38,661 --> 00:20:39,783
What do you say?

343
00:20:41,357 --> 00:20:42,830
What the fuck!

344
00:20:46,382 --> 00:20:48,719
I just love happy endings.

345
00:20:56,742 --> 00:20:57,759
It's still here.

346
00:20:58,455 --> 00:20:59,842
It's all still here!

347
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,687
Does that mean maybe we overreacted?

348
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:05,760
No, no. I wouldn't say that.

349
00:21:06,957 --> 00:21:08,153
It's just maybe,

350
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:11,614
maybe Obama will do all right.

351
00:21:19,463 --> 00:21:21,033
Where are my pants?

352
00:21:22,643 --> 00:21:24,057
Where's our TV?

353
00:21:24,177 --> 00:21:26,854
Where are my pants
and where's my TV?

354
00:21:26,974 --> 00:21:29,195
Dad, your boss called.
He said you're fired.

355
00:21:31,905 --> 00:21:34,997
Goddammit!
Obama said things would be different.

356
00:21:35,365 --> 00:21:37,514
That son of a bitch lied to us.

357
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:40,209
I knew I should have voted
for McCain.
